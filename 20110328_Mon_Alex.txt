[00:00.000 --> 00:11.180]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.180 --> 00:18.720]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:18.720 --> 00:31.220]  Texas Alex Jones we are live my friends thank you so much for joining us it is
[00:31.220 --> 00:38.360]  the 28th day of March 2011 on this Monday edition we're going to be here for
[00:38.360 --> 00:44.360]  the next three hours and we do in the last 30 minutes have Larry Pratt the
[00:44.360 --> 00:50.320]  director of gun owners of America joining us to look at the new raft of
[00:50.320 --> 00:57.720]  anti-second amendment victim disarmament tyranny legislation that Obama and the
[00:57.720 --> 01:02.000]  Democrats are announcing that they're preparing to try to foist on the American
[01:02.000 --> 01:08.280]  people now mainstream media in the last month including CBS news has picked up
[01:08.280 --> 01:15.140]  on the fact that the ATF was ordered to help get guns into Mexico in mass to the
[01:15.140 --> 01:20.000]  cartels so they could track them back to the US and use that as a pretext to try
[01:20.000 --> 01:24.520]  to pass anti-second amendment legislation claiming that the second
[01:24.520 --> 01:29.280]  amendment had caused the violence in Mexico not the kleptocracy that runs
[01:29.280 --> 01:35.320]  it not the phony drug war so an amazing false flag launched against the second
[01:35.320 --> 01:39.440]  amendment we're going to be discussing that with Larry Pratt coming up in the
[01:39.440 --> 01:45.480]  last 30 minutes today obviously in the meantime we've got a lot of extremely
[01:45.480 --> 01:52.040]  important news to cover in some very scary developments with the Fukushima
[01:52.040 --> 01:58.120]  reactor last Wednesday they reported 1600 times safe levels upwards of 20
[01:58.120 --> 02:03.120]  kilometers away then it was 10,000 times safe levels then there was an
[02:03.120 --> 02:08.080]  incredible report by Tokyo Power and Electric saying it was 10 million times
[02:08.080 --> 02:15.640]  they revised that to 100,000 times confirming 100,000 times safe levels
[02:15.640 --> 02:20.640]  and they admit even in the Washington Post that will kill you deader than a
[02:20.640 --> 02:25.760]  hammer if you just get limited exposure you get about a year's exposure of
[02:25.760 --> 02:31.760]  radiation in just 15 minutes from that level and of course that's just if it's
[02:31.760 --> 02:36.520]  basically background radiation if you inhale any of it it basically just sits
[02:36.520 --> 02:42.080]  inside your body baking you so we're going to be going over all of those new
[02:42.080 --> 02:50.200]  developments also Obama is to push his big Libya speech tonight the UN
[02:50.200 --> 02:54.680]  resolution and what Hillary Clinton is basically spun out of that is that if
[02:54.680 --> 02:59.960]  they don't accept a humanitarian ground force just like the bombardment isn't war
[02:59.960 --> 03:07.120]  it's kinetic military action and a ground invasion by the UN backed by NATO
[03:07.120 --> 03:13.480]  that won't be a ground invasion either that will be a I guess ground kinetic
[03:13.480 --> 03:19.440]  event or humanitarian mission so they're definitely stampeding towards that and
[03:19.440 --> 03:24.480]  the al-Qaeda rebels the good guys according to our control corporate
[03:24.480 --> 03:27.960]  press and they admit it's al-Qaeda but they say if you don't like it you're a
[03:27.960 --> 03:32.640]  conspiracy theorist I mean if you don't like Diet Coke you're a conspiracy
[03:32.640 --> 03:35.640]  theorist if you don't like MSG you're a conspiracy theorist if you don't like
[03:35.640 --> 03:40.800]  radiation you're a conspiracy theorist if Monbiot the big eugenicist is running
[03:40.800 --> 03:45.280]  around laughing saying he loves nuclear now Fukushima shows how great it is
[03:45.280 --> 03:49.640]  you're like well that's a bizarre crazy sounding statement they're attempting to
[03:49.640 --> 03:55.120]  basically just muddy the waters with purposeful confusion and insanity
[03:55.120 --> 04:01.600]  that's how desperate this system has gotten so Obama gears up for hard sell
[04:01.600 --> 04:08.360]  on Libya Libyan rebels al-Qaeda sees oil complexes amid reports opposition
[04:08.360 --> 04:15.760]  captures Heddafi's hometown depleted uranium a strange way to protect Libyan
[04:15.760 --> 04:21.000]  civilians they are bombarding them with DU but again radiation is life-giving
[04:21.000 --> 04:25.720]  according to Ann Coulter and Mr. Monbiot on the left and right another
[04:25.720 --> 04:29.560]  headline here from Eric Blair at info wars dot com liberals willing to trade
[04:29.560 --> 04:35.120]  blood and treasure for oil company profits under Obama also prominent
[04:35.120 --> 04:40.040]  Chinese blogger charged as crackdown deepens for criticizing government the
[04:40.040 --> 04:46.920]  Chinese dispense with a conspiracy theorist label like Cass Sunstein uses
[04:46.920 --> 04:51.080]  and we're going to be breaking all of that down today and a big New York
[04:51.080 --> 04:59.600]  magazine classic dribble hit piece will be heading on as well the Genesis
[04:59.600 --> 05:04.760]  communications radio network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because
[05:04.760 --> 05:24.720]  there's a war on for your mind again it is Monday the 28th day of March 2011
[05:24.720 --> 05:31.320]  Larry Pratt covering the Obama administration the Justice Department and
[05:31.320 --> 05:37.840]  the ATF caught red-handed even CBS News reported on this weeks ago shipping guns
[05:37.840 --> 05:42.640]  into Mexico allowing guns to be shipped in to then track them back so they could
[05:42.640 --> 05:46.800]  then blame the Second Amendment for all the problems of the corrupt failed
[05:46.800 --> 05:52.080]  state that is Mexico and they don't care that they've been caught there still as
[05:52.080 --> 05:59.280]  we predicted a year ago using the crisis in Mexico to go after the Second
[05:59.280 --> 06:03.080]  Amendment wasn't hard to see them getting that geared up and ready and of
[06:03.080 --> 06:06.360]  course we've had sources like Sally Castillo who's the head DEA agent in
[06:06.360 --> 06:11.080]  Latin America for many years on with us six years ago announcing the new war
[06:11.080 --> 06:15.160]  would be launched in Mexico by the big cartels laundering their money through
[06:15.160 --> 06:20.920]  large Western banks mainly in the US and Canada and that they were going to
[06:20.920 --> 06:24.040]  launch a war against the smaller cartels that were not laundering their money
[06:24.040 --> 06:28.760]  through them AP Bloomberg and others I have reported just the last three months
[06:28.760 --> 06:36.560]  360 plus billion laundered by one US bank alone that owned and chartered the
[06:36.560 --> 06:42.920]  aircraft to ship the cocaine heroin and marijuana into the United States and
[06:42.920 --> 06:49.000]  we've covered that at nauseam here but the fact is Obama has launched a false
[06:49.000 --> 06:54.880]  flag terror attack on America by shipping the guns to Mexico that were then
[06:54.880 --> 07:01.080]  used in crimes in Mexico and the US as a pretext to crack down on the Second
[07:01.080 --> 07:06.600]  Amendment that is an act of terrorism if I shipped thousands of guns to Mexico
[07:06.600 --> 07:12.400]  to create violence so that I could get a political goal achieved that follows
[07:12.400 --> 07:18.000]  the classical definition of terrorism to carry out violence or threaten violence
[07:18.000 --> 07:24.600]  to pressure a political organization or a group or population into submitting to
[07:24.600 --> 07:31.560]  your political demands terrorism terrorist run America and are running it
[07:31.560 --> 07:36.720]  into the ground and the globalist have successfully taken over the US and much
[07:36.720 --> 07:41.520]  of the planet they're mopping up the few Third World countries that they didn't
[07:41.520 --> 07:46.680]  control like Libya right now throwing out dictators that weren't properly
[07:46.680 --> 07:52.160]  subservient and sycophantic like who's the mubarak in Egypt and of course
[07:52.160 --> 08:00.040]  they're marching on towards Syria Iran Indonesia and of course Russia so that
[08:00.040 --> 08:07.320]  is just some of what's coming up today I want to hit the latest Libyan news and
[08:07.320 --> 08:15.920]  the latest Fukushima news as the crisis intensifies but it's a 1617 day old
[08:15.920 --> 08:21.560]  crisis kind of like now Hades a year old and people don't even know that
[08:21.560 --> 08:27.960]  100,000 plus died tens of thousands of died since one of the biggest humanitarian
[08:27.960 --> 08:32.360]  disasters in modern history but it's not in the headlines anymore so we just
[08:32.360 --> 08:40.280]  forget about it it's the same thing with Japan the Washington Post AFP and AP are
[08:40.280 --> 08:48.040]  all reporting that the Japanese have confirmed 100,000 times safe levels of
[08:48.040 --> 08:56.440]  radiation pouring out of the shattered nuclear reactors at Fukushima 100,000
[08:56.440 --> 09:03.520]  times first it's 1600 last Wednesday then it's 10,000 on Friday now on
[09:03.520 --> 09:07.920]  Saturday the Japanese put out a false report misreading their their Geiger
[09:07.920 --> 09:12.800]  counters of 10 million times they revised it by Sunday evening and said
[09:12.800 --> 09:19.160]  excuse us it's only 100,000 times and I want to get to that first but coming up
[09:19.160 --> 09:29.560]  later in the hour and and Paul Watson is set to publish a rebuke of this latest
[09:29.560 --> 09:40.720]  classical hit piece at prisonplanet.com we have a detailed very lengthy report
[09:40.720 --> 09:46.760]  and we'll put this up on screen for viewers and it's got a bizarre headline
[09:46.760 --> 09:53.880]  a strange man is following you and it says shouting about mind control
[09:53.880 --> 10:00.400]  assassins the 911 conspiracy and the Bilderberg group radio host Alex Jones
[10:00.400 --> 10:07.840]  has cornered the bipartisan paranoia market and you can see I put my war
[10:07.840 --> 10:15.480]  face on there for the globalist that will then get the people reading New York
[10:15.480 --> 10:19.320]  magazine to then actually read the article and then they'll actually find
[10:19.320 --> 10:28.680]  the real show not the straw man cliche created by Joe Hagen so that is coming
[10:28.680 --> 10:36.800]  up and it dovetails with a sickening piece well it's sickening what media
[10:36.800 --> 10:44.120]  matters has been caught doing media matters war against Fox ten million
[10:44.120 --> 10:50.720]  dollars a year tax-free it's 501c3 they tell your local church if they speak out
[10:50.720 --> 10:55.920]  against abortion they'll have their 501c3 taken no free speech that's all
[10:55.920 --> 11:03.880]  fraud but then media matters can openly announce publicly a guerrilla war to
[11:03.880 --> 11:09.600]  destroy Fox and destroy their business that is torturous interference I mean
[11:09.600 --> 11:14.040]  there's no doubt Fox could absolutely destroy them in court but because they're
[11:14.040 --> 11:17.680]  funded by George Soros and others they will just simply pop up a new
[11:17.680 --> 11:22.560]  organization it's a kamikaze missile they've always posed as if they're this
[11:22.560 --> 11:27.880]  nonpartisan organization but now they admit that they are basically a
[11:27.880 --> 11:34.440]  Democratic Party missile and what's happening here is the Republicans and
[11:34.440 --> 11:39.440]  Democrats do fight with each other but over the reins of power not over the
[11:39.440 --> 11:43.960]  overall globalist policies and the corrupt elite destroying our free market
[11:43.960 --> 11:50.920]  and setting up a crony capitalist non free market fascistic system and when
[11:50.920 --> 11:55.280]  you read the quotes in Politico by the head of media matters media matters is
[11:55.280 --> 11:59.680]  such a dishonest organization that one of their top writers called me for a
[11:59.680 --> 12:03.040]  story a few months ago it's three four months ago and I said well you know
[12:03.040 --> 12:06.160]  George Soros funds you and it's part of the federal filings he said no he
[12:06.160 --> 12:11.240]  doesn't when I got off the phone I looked it up again and there were
[12:11.240 --> 12:14.720]  millions and millions of dollars he'd given and he just given another million
[12:14.720 --> 12:20.400]  to him days before I mean it's basically George Soros run they give their
[12:20.400 --> 12:26.040]  talking points to MSNBC and then they think you're so stupid they tell you
[12:26.040 --> 12:29.840]  that they're not and again I'm gonna cover this more later in the hour but
[12:29.840 --> 12:34.680]  listen to this the liberal group media matters is quietly transformed itself in
[12:34.680 --> 12:39.000]  preparation for what its founder David Brock described in an interview as an
[12:39.000 --> 12:45.200]  all-out campaign of guerrilla warfare and sabotage really if I announced an
[12:45.200 --> 12:51.120]  all-out war guerrilla war of sabotage and said I was gonna try to bankrupt say
[12:51.120 --> 12:58.080]  the Austin American statesman that's actionable especially because they've
[12:58.080 --> 13:01.720]  been caught putting out so much disinformation you know the truth is a
[13:01.720 --> 13:06.840]  total defense against slander libel defamation but it's not when you can be
[13:06.840 --> 13:12.720]  proven to be putting out this info with the intent to do harm I mean that's the
[13:12.720 --> 13:20.040]  definition and very very dangerous and of course we're big critics of Fox as
[13:20.040 --> 13:25.600]  well they engage in a lot of skull-duggery but but nothing this nasty
[13:25.600 --> 13:32.080]  openly this is a whole new level and they've already been doing this for
[13:32.080 --> 13:36.520]  years but now they're being honest about it the group launched as a more
[13:36.520 --> 13:42.700]  traditional media critic yeah right has all been abandoned it's monitoring a
[13:42.700 --> 13:47.800]  newspaper's other television networks and is narrowing its focus to Fox in a
[13:47.800 --> 13:53.080]  handful of conservative websites and of course you see that they attack me three
[13:53.080 --> 14:01.120]  times last week it's kind of creepy to know that they spend about 20% of their
[14:01.120 --> 14:07.000]  time on info wars calm and prison planet calm and yours truly and and the rest of
[14:07.000 --> 14:11.400]  time is on Glenbeck Sean Hannity a rush limbaugh I mean they literally I've been
[14:11.400 --> 14:18.000]  tracking it they they spend I mean this is a group run by George Soros who is
[14:18.000 --> 14:21.880]  openly in the news calling for global government openly calling for an end of
[14:21.880 --> 14:25.400]  the dollar he's been convicted in foreign countries of imploding their
[14:25.400 --> 14:30.720]  currencies he did a 60 minutes interview over a decade ago admitting he helped
[14:30.720 --> 14:37.920]  Nazis go around and round up and arrest people and take their property and I
[14:37.920 --> 14:49.200]  mean he's totally dangerous and scary and the the Rolling Stone guy that came
[14:49.200 --> 14:53.400]  to interview me it's in Politico and I'm gonna talk to him today that he's
[14:53.400 --> 15:01.520]  just like a secret operative forum and that's in Politico and this Hagan guy
[15:01.520 --> 15:05.760]  fits the bill with this New York magazine attack piece and they sit there
[15:05.760 --> 15:13.400]  and poses liberals when they're talking to you and the Alexander character he
[15:13.400 --> 15:18.280]  you know told me that you know he thinks the 9-11 story isn't true and that he
[15:18.280 --> 15:22.520]  appreciated Noam Chomsky coming out and saying now more and more that bin Laden
[15:22.520 --> 15:26.640]  wasn't involved involved and it's a cover-up and so you can sit there and
[15:26.640 --> 15:30.120]  eat Mexican food with these people and they'll act completely normal and nice
[15:30.120 --> 15:37.920]  and their actual operatives of these groups and I'm gonna get both these
[15:37.920 --> 15:40.960]  writers on now I hadn't really seen a reason to get them on until now but
[15:40.960 --> 15:45.440]  we'll see if they'll come on the next week I want to get both the Rolling
[15:45.440 --> 15:51.480]  Stone writer who's now an admitted operative of media matters no doubt
[15:51.480 --> 15:58.280]  garnering intelligence down here they can spin and the other guy writing just an
[15:58.280 --> 16:05.320]  amazing hit piece so filled with cliches I mean it is interestingly written I
[16:05.320 --> 16:15.040]  mean it was a good read but Joe Hagan a strange man is following you and I don't
[16:15.040 --> 16:20.440]  even know what to say with this 11 page article in fact guys go to go to like
[16:20.440 --> 16:24.560]  page three of it they have this map with my head in the middle of it and how I
[16:24.560 --> 16:29.880]  see all these shadowy groups running the worldwide web of globalism well that's
[16:29.880 --> 16:35.480]  what the globalists say they are doing that's what these organizations like the
[16:35.480 --> 16:39.560]  Royal Institute of International Affairs CFR admit is their goal that's what
[16:39.560 --> 16:43.440]  Rothkopf wrote superclass three years ago ahead of the Kissinger group and
[16:43.440 --> 16:48.360]  said 6,000 super gophers run things for the global elite I mean world
[16:48.360 --> 16:55.560]  government is admitted and they just make all these jokes about it
[16:55.560 --> 17:25.120]  mom be yachts making jokes about radiation being good for you
[17:25.560 --> 17:35.120]  we move quick here we churn out information warfare weapons using the
[17:35.120 --> 17:39.880]  truth at a speed much more rapid for the smaller team in the mainstream media
[17:39.880 --> 17:44.560]  can but I just talked to Paul Watson it won't be until later in the next hour
[17:44.560 --> 17:49.040]  that his big counter report that I worked on with him this morning on just
[17:49.040 --> 17:53.280]  some of the things that weren't truthful and that weren't accurate in this big
[17:53.280 --> 18:00.000]  hit piece out of New York magazine against yours truly and a lot of times
[18:00.000 --> 18:07.880]  I don't cover hit pieces that cover yours truly unless it's an educational tool
[18:07.880 --> 18:15.840]  and I never really got into the Rolling Stone cover piece that they did a major
[18:15.840 --> 18:22.200]  piece that they did a few weeks ago but but but looking at all the news about
[18:22.200 --> 18:26.760]  Cass Sunstein the White House regulations are saying arrest conspiracy
[18:26.760 --> 18:31.680]  terrorist at least tax them put government messages over their websites
[18:31.680 --> 18:38.440]  seize their websites infiltrate their organizations engage in Cointel probe
[18:38.440 --> 18:49.880]  when I saw the writer for New York magazine basically defend in a sideways
[18:49.880 --> 18:57.080]  fashion when I saw him defend Cass Sunstein in here as a guy trying to
[18:57.080 --> 19:01.760]  stop my dangerous information and other people's dangerous information and I
[19:01.760 --> 19:08.800]  see media matters coming out and saying it is their job to destroy Fox News and
[19:08.800 --> 19:13.680]  other conservative websites and I'm one of the big ones listed that they go
[19:13.680 --> 19:21.360]  after on a weekly basis sometimes three four five times a week we need to really
[19:21.360 --> 19:28.840]  be conscious of how real this war is and how they've declared war on us now I
[19:28.840 --> 19:33.440]  tend to take the field of battle with these people and I tend to you know try
[19:33.440 --> 19:38.000]  to give them information I tried to give Joe Hagan of New York magazine
[19:38.000 --> 19:42.240]  documents for everything I was covering he wasn't really interested in that neither
[19:42.240 --> 19:48.000]  was nightline neither was Rolling Stone because they want that plausible
[19:48.000 --> 19:52.480]  deniability they just want to say Alex says there's evidence of government
[19:52.480 --> 19:57.360]  sponsored terror Alex says there's a history of it Alex says there's a
[19:57.360 --> 20:01.920]  history of eugenics and population reduction Alex says the elites are
[20:01.920 --> 20:06.320]  talking about exterminating 80% of us when I'm there trying to give them
[20:06.320 --> 20:11.240]  biological diversity assessments from the UN I'm trying to give them Ted Turner
[20:11.240 --> 20:15.520]  quotes David Rockefeller quotes I'm trying to give them counsel on foreign
[20:15.520 --> 20:21.160]  relations reports I'm trying to give them the proof of this global system that's
[20:21.160 --> 20:25.640]  been set up by the mega banks who have who have unlimited capital because they
[20:25.640 --> 20:30.920]  control the issuance of currency and credit and my family's under attack your
[20:30.920 --> 20:36.240]  family's under attack no one can deny that liberty is waning worldwide that
[20:36.240 --> 20:42.360]  governments are rolling out a continuity of agenda an integrated tyranny I mean
[20:42.360 --> 20:47.520]  Joe Hagan makes jokes that I'm been talking about because he was here three
[20:47.520 --> 20:54.120]  weeks ago he makes jokes that I'm saying that the West is involved in trying to
[20:54.120 --> 20:59.480]  overthrow Qaddafi and trying to overthrow Egypt when it's on record
[20:59.480 --> 21:03.760]  financial times of London that the new government the West helped put in has
[21:03.760 --> 21:08.680]  banned all protest period in Egypt or that it's now admitted three weeks after I
[21:08.680 --> 21:12.720]  told him and of course I was saying it weeks before that that it was Al Qaeda in
[21:12.720 --> 21:17.040]  the east that Al Qaeda was being used to try to overthrow Qaddafi that's now
[21:17.040 --> 21:24.880]  London Telegraph Associated Press New York Times Washington Post I mean if you
[21:24.880 --> 21:29.040]  actually go through everything I say and then research it you're going to find
[21:29.040 --> 21:38.320]  that the information is there and the system is extremely threatened by us
[21:38.320 --> 21:41.920]  telling the truth they're extremely threatened by the fact that they've been
[21:41.920 --> 21:46.400]  caught lying and engaging in so much oppression and so much corruption for so
[21:46.400 --> 21:50.560]  long that they're really floundering around and that's what's happening is
[21:50.560 --> 21:56.440]  they've tried to ignore us in past decades and now they can't because their
[21:56.440 --> 22:01.000]  agenda is now out in the open they've been so successful at setting up their
[22:01.000 --> 22:08.400]  private corporate criminal piratical system that they can't deny it anymore
[22:08.400 --> 22:15.600]  they can't hide it anymore and so they're bringing it out in the open and and
[22:15.600 --> 22:20.200]  saying Cass Sunstein's trying to stop violence Cass Sunstein's doing what he
[22:20.200 --> 22:26.840]  has to when when Cass Sunstein is calling for open classical tyranny and
[22:26.840 --> 22:32.560]  the carbon tax Al Gore George Soros crowd is calling for green fascism all
[22:32.560 --> 22:37.100]  over the news and saying they should be undemocratic and nuclear expert
[22:37.100 --> 22:44.560]  Monbiot global warming alarmist and nuclear well I'm gonna break that down
[22:44.560 --> 22:51.080]  when we come back it's just it's just it's very sad it's very very sad
[23:08.040 --> 23:12.880]  okay I'm gonna revisit all of this at the bottom of the next hour with a
[23:12.880 --> 23:20.080]  cogent focused rebuke of the dangerous activities of George Soros and his
[23:20.080 --> 23:25.560]  subversive revolutionary anti-american organizations like media matters
[23:25.560 --> 23:30.440]  remember Soros admittedly has been instrumental in overthrowing many
[23:30.440 --> 23:36.280]  nations in Eastern Europe his organizations are publicly involved in
[23:36.280 --> 23:43.160]  Egypt and other areas that's not debated Google was involved in the
[23:43.160 --> 23:48.360]  overthrow of Egypt and they make fun of me in the article saying Google has
[23:48.360 --> 23:53.160]  government connections Google was set up by the federal government on record
[23:53.160 --> 24:00.560]  12 years ago and with funding via the CIA's public funding arm in QTEL that
[24:00.560 --> 24:06.640]  again they count on you being ignorant they play with theater of the mind
[24:06.640 --> 24:11.720]  knowing that many people don't have a basic historical lens to see the world
[24:11.720 --> 24:18.480]  through or a geopolitical current lens or a view with human anthropology
[24:18.480 --> 24:24.640]  sociology psychology but I study these people I read the white papers they
[24:24.640 --> 24:29.640]  push back and forth with each other we published and first broke because it was
[24:29.640 --> 24:36.280]  hidden in plain view years ago Cass Sunstein calling for our arrest and
[24:36.280 --> 24:40.800]  Soros who overthrows countries currencies who overthrows their
[24:40.800 --> 24:47.720]  governments who's a top globalist operative who openly helped the Nazis
[24:47.720 --> 24:56.320]  rob Jews and then he puts out newspaper ads rebuking Glenn Beck for mentioning
[24:56.320 --> 25:00.880]  it saying it's horrible and untasteful know what he did was distasteful and
[25:00.880 --> 25:07.880]  evil I mean it's incredible it's incredible how nakedly corrupt and evil
[25:07.880 --> 25:13.240]  and then they're always surrounded by a coterie of fake liberals to give them
[25:13.240 --> 25:18.720]  fake liberal cover on the liberal wing of this global corporate system and then
[25:18.720 --> 25:25.240]  just as bad just as disgusting are the fake Republicans they're there to just
[25:25.240 --> 25:31.560]  co-opt the conservative movement in this country and to to to see all the
[25:31.560 --> 25:36.720]  admissions of their co-intel pro and the Pentagon teaming up with them to to
[25:36.720 --> 25:42.640]  pose as bloggers and to attack anybody that questions wars or surveillance or
[25:42.640 --> 25:51.160]  the police state and to witness all of the all of the undemocratic draconian
[25:51.160 --> 25:56.320]  attacks on free speech and protesting and the admissions of unbridled
[25:56.320 --> 26:04.840]  warrantless wiretapping it was just five short years ago that Bush would go out
[26:04.840 --> 26:08.720]  and give speeches and say it's a ridiculous conspiracy theory that we're
[26:08.720 --> 26:13.320]  spying on you without warrants and then it came out that they were and it had
[26:13.320 --> 26:19.760]  nothing to do with Al Qaeda and now today the head of Google Schmidt comes out
[26:19.760 --> 26:24.800]  in modern days and says yeah we're watching everything you're doing we're
[26:24.800 --> 26:27.680]  tracking everything you're doing and now they're saying he may be the new
[26:27.680 --> 26:34.920]  commerce secretary and so they put out this selection to the American people
[26:34.920 --> 26:39.400]  the British people the German people the Japanese people it's it's it's the
[26:39.400 --> 26:43.440]  fake choice where they put out two or three different political parties with
[26:43.440 --> 26:49.280]  slight differences on the surface slight rhetorical differences via a little
[26:49.280 --> 26:55.160]  semantical distractions and then tell you to choose from that and then use that
[26:55.160 --> 27:00.640]  atomized balkanized divide and conquer system to play us off against each other
[27:00.640 --> 27:06.160]  when all of our interest as American citizens whether you're a cop a school
[27:06.160 --> 27:11.120]  teacher in the military a private business owner somebody who's in a union
[27:11.120 --> 27:17.880]  a machinist a textile worker we're all being hurt by globalism globalism is
[27:17.880 --> 27:23.280]  anti-family globalism is anti-independent globalism is anti-true-free market
[27:23.280 --> 27:30.480]  anti-wealth their stated goal at nauseam is a post industrial world these are
[27:30.480 --> 27:37.840]  horrible control freaks who've created a quasi scientific cosmology and
[27:37.840 --> 27:43.880]  philosophy for what they do a war against the nation-state a war against the
[27:43.880 --> 27:50.680]  family a war against the individual now in these fights in the left right
[27:50.680 --> 27:57.360]  paradigm they do hate each other there's no doubt Roger Ailes fears the
[27:57.360 --> 28:03.040]  Democrats and George Soros and has bodyguards I've confirmed that from
[28:03.040 --> 28:08.000]  inside Fox News from two different sources and from a former governor whose
[28:08.000 --> 28:13.480]  friends with are I'm not even supposed to say it I'm gonna leave it right there
[28:13.480 --> 28:19.440]  the point is Roger Ailes the head of Fox has bodyguards folks he's scared to
[28:19.440 --> 28:23.480]  death he's had him for more than a decade because of threats and and
[28:23.480 --> 28:29.240]  recrimination can you imagine so yes there is a fight between Roger Ailes and
[28:29.240 --> 28:36.440]  the Clintons all of that is real but then for the last 15 years or more Rush
[28:36.440 --> 28:41.040]  Limbaugh created by Roger Ailes he's the guy that got him his job syndicated him
[28:41.040 --> 28:48.000]  then he created Fox News with Murdoch was brought on because of that successful
[28:48.000 --> 28:53.080]  model to say there are no special forces secret drills they call it black
[28:53.080 --> 28:57.480]  helicopters there you know there is no mission creep domestically for for the
[28:57.480 --> 29:01.080]  military to be used domestically now it's admitted that's been set up you
[29:01.080 --> 29:09.160]  know mainstream AP Toronto newspaper Ottawa citizen yes deals have been signed
[29:09.160 --> 29:13.320]  to use foreign troops in America to suppress dissenters I mean it's now
[29:13.320 --> 29:19.400]  mainstream news and to make jokes about the Federal Reserve isn't private and
[29:19.400 --> 29:23.960]  it's not corrupt and the Council on Foreign Relations doesn't exist but
[29:23.960 --> 29:30.360]  because of the alternative media and decades of work by myself and people
[29:30.360 --> 29:37.520]  like G Edward Griffin going back 40 plus years and Red Beckman and countless
[29:37.520 --> 29:41.240]  others because of that and because we didn't mind being attacked being
[29:41.240 --> 29:46.400]  demonized some people like Red Beckman being arrested some people being killed
[29:46.400 --> 29:50.160]  or run out of the country like Bob Chapman you know the government trying
[29:50.160 --> 29:54.800]  to plant hand grenades in his house because of the willingness to be
[29:54.800 --> 30:00.000]  attacked and demonized we told people what was coming it it's it's now much
[30:00.000 --> 30:04.840]  of it arrived the train is pulling into the station the people can see it now
[30:04.840 --> 30:12.040]  world governments are being openly admitted and so out comes Fox News two
[30:12.040 --> 30:17.400]  years ago with Dick Morris saying hey the conspiracy theorists were wrong
[30:17.400 --> 30:21.320]  about world government you intake over global currency but now they're right
[30:21.320 --> 30:27.640]  that's a quote and and so Beck goes from a mainline conservative to having G
[30:27.640 --> 30:35.920]  Edward Griffin on for over 30 minutes Friday now back I did watch it was
[30:35.920 --> 30:42.640]  saying with the Cato guy it's an accident the feds don't mean this and the
[30:42.640 --> 30:46.960]  Federal Reserve fed a name only and then Griffin would come back and say no
[30:46.960 --> 30:51.400]  actually it is planned and it is designed we have their documents but
[30:51.400 --> 30:56.800]  but they're having to even get more quote extreme and tell more of the truth
[30:56.800 --> 31:02.000]  to maintain any credibility to delicate balance if Fox allows some truth to
[31:02.000 --> 31:06.240]  come out they will have more viewers than all other cable news combined as
[31:06.240 --> 31:11.080]  they do just because there's a little bit of truth what do you think happens
[31:11.080 --> 31:17.120]  when we tell you the whole thing we go right to the rock bottom right to the
[31:17.120 --> 31:27.560]  bone right to the stinking guts of this thing not dumb down radio not idiocy now
[31:27.560 --> 31:31.560]  that said I'm not gonna address Glenn Beck in detail because I have too much
[31:31.560 --> 31:37.200]  serious news to cover but understanding the different facets of this
[31:37.200 --> 31:42.840]  information war going on will help people navigate the propaganda and the
[31:42.840 --> 31:48.000]  disinformation but Glenn Beck did a good thing Friday having G ever Griffin on we
[31:48.000 --> 31:53.000]  try to commend him we does the right thing but he did the wrong thing playing
[31:53.000 --> 31:59.440]  out of context my interview with Charlie Sheen where I was going there to help
[31:59.440 --> 32:03.960]  him stay clean and off drugs sober because he was cooped up in his house
[32:03.960 --> 32:08.160]  with you know sobriety coaches and a nurse he's have come out here and you
[32:08.160 --> 32:12.480]  know hang out with me we'll talk about politics for the weekend and when I got
[32:12.480 --> 32:16.120]  Charlie on because I was there basically coaching him when I was there I'm like
[32:16.120 --> 32:19.720]  good job good job you're you're not using drugs you're not drinking great job
[32:19.720 --> 32:27.160]  Charlie you know you're clean and Beck took it and just said what is he talking
[32:27.160 --> 32:30.120]  about Charlie you look great you're clean what are they in the shower
[32:30.120 --> 32:36.000]  together having sex you know I mean it was bizarre and he went on and on and on
[32:36.000 --> 32:39.480]  out of context I was going over media lies you know they were saying Charlie
[32:39.480 --> 32:43.640]  doesn't have a hernia well I've known Charlie for six years swam in a swimming
[32:43.640 --> 32:48.080]  pool many times you know with him and friends and he's got a high anal hernia
[32:48.080 --> 32:53.560]  like I do up on the top of his stomach his rib cage and I explained on air I've
[32:53.560 --> 32:57.080]  got the same high anal hernia Beck took that out of context and had me saying
[32:57.080 --> 33:01.160]  I've seen your hernia and they went into I've been in the shower I saw his
[33:01.160 --> 33:06.800]  hernia I licked his hemorrhoids I I can't even say all this on air it was so
[33:06.800 --> 33:14.560]  pornographic that I licked sores I sucked sores all again that's the curtain
[33:14.560 --> 33:18.760]  that's the deception they could take little bitty clips Amigo and great job
[33:18.760 --> 33:25.080]  man you're off drugs you're clean you're sober you're working out you look great
[33:25.080 --> 33:29.080]  because Charlie been clean for off and on close to a decade went on a seven month
[33:29.080 --> 33:33.760]  party went from being what he publicly said a Christian I've been at his house
[33:33.760 --> 33:38.680]  where he talks about God this great focused guy to seven month party coming
[33:38.680 --> 33:44.360]  off the drugs bouncing off the walls manic and I'm on air going good job man
[33:44.360 --> 33:50.520]  you're clean you're gaining weight you're off the drugs you know and they
[33:50.520 --> 33:55.000]  turn that into something and it's just like what but I understand worldliness
[33:55.000 --> 33:59.480]  I understand being petty and having kind of a seventh grade mentality but
[33:59.480 --> 34:05.920]  that's what it sounded like so here's here's Beck doing a great thing having
[34:05.920 --> 34:09.400]  G. Edward Griffin on being attacked by the globalist in George Soros because
[34:09.400 --> 34:13.160]  he's exposing the new global currency they're planned to kill the dollar the
[34:13.160 --> 34:17.960]  real death of America and I want to be able to come in back like I come in
[34:17.960 --> 34:23.160]  Judge Andrew De Palatano who was the same yesterday today and tomorrow a
[34:23.160 --> 34:29.680]  mainline Ron Paul type guy great guy I love to support Lou Dobbs don't even
[34:29.680 --> 34:34.960]  agree with everything he says but I know he's real I would love Glenn Beck to to
[34:34.960 --> 34:39.600]  try to support you but I mean look what you do to me we've confirmed that big
[34:39.600 --> 34:43.280]  sponsors that are our sponsors their outfit goes and tries to get them and
[34:43.280 --> 34:46.200]  say we'll give you a better deal if you don't be with Alex you don't sponsor
[34:46.200 --> 34:50.520]  Alex Jones that's torturous interference that's the kind of stuff that
[34:50.520 --> 34:55.720]  media matters does to you guest after guest as yeah Glenn Beck you know heard
[34:55.720 --> 34:59.960]  about me on your show and when they had me on they got me in the back room and
[34:59.960 --> 35:04.960]  said don't go on Alex Jones's show and I can name right now Fox News host that
[35:04.960 --> 35:09.840]  have been told don't come on here I was scheduled on Fox News when I was in
[35:09.840 --> 35:14.440]  New York guess who killed it but I was supposed to just like that oh thank you
[35:14.440 --> 35:17.520]  Glenn for going after my sponsors are trying to take him away thank you that's
[35:17.520 --> 35:23.240]  real nice doing what George Soros does to you oh thank you Glenn telling my
[35:23.240 --> 35:26.400]  guests after guests not to come on my show or you won't have them on yours
[35:26.400 --> 35:31.560]  thanks a lot man that's really nice thanks for taking out a context me saying
[35:31.560 --> 35:36.360]  great job you look great Charlie you're clean and imply it was some type of
[35:36.360 --> 35:41.000]  gay thing thanks a lot man
[35:41.000 --> 35:46.160]  you know all I want is freedom for my children you are the one attacking me
[35:46.160 --> 35:52.400]  covertly for years and I'm sick of it okay I understand that we're the real
[35:52.400 --> 35:56.080]  deal because we're not run by Fox I understand we're able to cover real
[35:56.080 --> 36:00.960]  issues and you're not I understand that and I commend you when you go in the
[36:00.960 --> 36:07.120]  right direction but but you know you media matters and George Soros brag that
[36:07.120 --> 36:11.440]  they've targeted and helped destroy 400 plus sponsors of blend back and I've
[36:11.440 --> 36:15.400]  said that's wrong going after the free press in this country it's wrong to do
[36:15.400 --> 36:21.920]  that to the Democrats but it's not nice to do it to me and you're a hypocrite
[36:21.920 --> 36:27.960]  and I've been trying to do it all a branch like six months ago because it's
[36:27.960 --> 36:32.520]  all over scientific reports that macular degeneration of the eye is linked to
[36:32.520 --> 36:36.560]  excitotoxins we've had brain surgeons eye surgeons on to talk about it Dr.
[36:36.560 --> 36:41.480]  Blalock and others there's mainline studies for decades that it breaks down
[36:41.480 --> 36:45.120]  on the wood alcohol everybody knows what alcohol makes you go blind it can do it
[36:45.120 --> 36:50.120]  overnight if you get enough of it but over time aspartame also MSG attacks the
[36:50.120 --> 36:54.240]  optic nerve and we wrote an article saying Glenn you say you're going blind
[36:54.240 --> 36:58.840]  you'll be probably completely blind in a decade don't drink Diet Coke he went on
[36:58.840 --> 37:04.560]  and attacked me for that very worldly and let me tell you Glenn you're the guy
[37:04.560 --> 37:09.800]  gets up at the at the Lincoln Memorial talks about God talks about Christianity
[37:09.800 --> 37:15.040]  and and do it as a good actor and try to bring people together which is a good
[37:15.040 --> 37:19.280]  thing and then you get on air in an eight-minute pornographic rant that I
[37:19.280 --> 37:25.360]  that is so horrible I can't even air it here about about well I already said one
[37:25.360 --> 37:32.920]  of the things just just the most filthy sucking of sores just things I can't
[37:32.920 --> 37:41.000]  even say on air you know amazing amazing stuff absolutely even though I'm a
[37:41.000 --> 37:45.020]  public figure you could probably be brought to heel for that in court but
[37:45.020 --> 37:50.160]  I don't it's you that's discredited I don't have time for that stuff I don't
[37:50.160 --> 37:54.120]  care what happens to me or what people think about me but I mean it's it's just
[37:54.120 --> 37:58.000]  so vicious but I read a news report and who knows if it's true the media lies
[37:58.000 --> 38:02.560]  so much they glim back once had another host that worked at the same station as
[38:02.560 --> 38:05.840]  him decades ago and the guy went to another station and was married and
[38:05.840 --> 38:09.920]  they were competitors then and she had a miscarriage and reportedly he's
[38:09.920 --> 38:13.640]  admitted to this I haven't seen that so I can't vouch for it but then he called
[38:13.640 --> 38:19.400]  up said I'm glad your wife had a miscarriage I mean that makes me feel
[38:19.400 --> 38:24.760]  bad for you Glenn and I and I wasn't even sure I those reports were real when I
[38:24.760 --> 38:31.160]  saw him months ago but seeing what you did Friday I mean it's incredible that
[38:31.160 --> 38:37.040]  you would sit there and and engage in that type of editing of the tape to try
[38:37.040 --> 38:45.920]  to imply things like that is just outrageous it's outrageous and I won't
[38:45.920 --> 38:52.400]  do things to people that I wouldn't want done to me and I find it very bad karma
[38:52.400 --> 38:58.240]  you could say you report you so very bad luck in Texas we boil it down to that
[38:58.240 --> 39:04.280]  to do to me behind the scenes what George Soros has been doing to you and
[39:04.280 --> 39:15.000]  Roger Ailes I see I'm already getting into this it it's just I've got clip
[39:15.000 --> 39:19.960]  after clip of Fox News and Glenn Beck saying arrest 9-11 truthers they're
[39:19.960 --> 39:24.680]  dangerous their terrorist taser them we've played those clips I've got the
[39:24.680 --> 39:28.120]  Cass Sunstein report saying arrest 9-11 truthers and people that don't believe in
[39:28.120 --> 39:31.400]  global warming well whether you don't agree with somebody that doesn't believe
[39:31.400 --> 39:34.560]  in anthropogenic global warming or whether you do agree with them you
[39:34.560 --> 39:38.640]  shouldn't call for their arrest whether you agree or disagree with 9-11
[39:38.640 --> 39:42.680]  truthers that question the official story of 9-11 a wide spectrum of people
[39:42.680 --> 39:47.880]  you shouldn't call for their arrest you shouldn't three years ago during the key
[39:47.880 --> 39:51.520]  primaries come out and say Ron Paul's dangerous and we made you to use the
[39:51.520 --> 39:57.680]  army against his listeners against his supporters I mean Glenn supports torture
[39:57.680 --> 40:03.480]  he supports secret arrest he supports the Patriot Act he supports these wars
[40:03.480 --> 40:12.080]  until now he's starting to get it and go wait al-Qaeda's in it Libya why are we
[40:12.080 --> 40:18.680]  helping al-Qaeda cuz I saw his headline last Friday al-Qaeda US inadvertently
[40:18.680 --> 40:21.520]  helping al-Qaeda and Libya inadvertently did they inadvertently help them
[40:21.520 --> 40:25.280]  against the Serbs they inadvertently help them against the Russians wasn't an
[40:25.280 --> 40:29.120]  accident when Amar al-Laki Fox News reported hangs out secretly at the
[40:29.120 --> 40:35.680]  Pentagon getting orders last October reported listen Glenn what you don't
[40:35.680 --> 40:40.240]  get is if we don't beat this new world order there is no future oh they're
[40:40.240 --> 40:43.960]  gonna come after you pal they're already coming after me you finally started
[40:43.960 --> 40:47.120]  reporting that they're trying to say you're gonna cause an Oklahoma City in
[40:47.120 --> 41:06.920]  those media matters reports they say you and I are you figure that out yet buddy
[41:06.920 --> 41:10.840]  okay I'm gonna get into the Fukushima situation and the big developments in
[41:10.840 --> 41:15.280]  Libya and Obama's speech they may be getting the public ready for the ground
[41:15.280 --> 41:20.280]  invasion it'll be called the humanitarian mission and the bombing is
[41:20.280 --> 41:24.720]  not called a war they've now just are flooding the airwaves with our well-earned
[41:24.720 --> 41:31.400]  false reality to just set the precedent where people are prepared as they
[41:31.400 --> 41:40.720]  titrate the dose for just more and more brazen extreme bizarre lies but you know
[41:40.720 --> 41:46.280]  trying to go through this New York magazine disinformation piece a strange
[41:46.280 --> 41:52.360]  man is following you about myself there's just all sorts of little
[41:52.360 --> 41:57.160]  deceptions in here like he kept asking me you want to be on Fox News don't you
[41:57.160 --> 42:02.960]  you want to be on Fox News I said no Fox News will never have me on as a host
[42:02.960 --> 42:07.040]  because I would have to have a hundred percent control and that will never
[42:07.040 --> 42:10.680]  happen because they're the other wing of the new world order co-opting system
[42:10.680 --> 42:17.520]  and so then they try to then they go to Ted Anderson and so they can get a
[42:17.520 --> 42:21.000]  quote and Ted says yeah I think Alex would be somebody like them might
[42:21.000 --> 42:24.280]  approach him to be on but he'd only go on if he had a hundred percent control
[42:24.280 --> 42:28.800]  and then they go on to say but Alex isn't burning his bridges you know he
[42:28.800 --> 42:33.520]  he came out and said Roger Ailes is a good guy and anti-New World Order that's
[42:33.520 --> 42:37.840]  not what I said I said Roger Ailes is afraid of the Clintons and George
[42:37.840 --> 42:44.440]  Soros and has Navy SEAL bodyguards Glen Beck has FBI retired FBI agent bodyguards
[42:44.440 --> 42:47.680]  you can actually ferret around and find that mainstream news if you want to check
[42:47.680 --> 42:52.960]  that and I said so there's a real fight between these groups but they're only
[42:52.960 --> 42:58.680]  fighting over the levers of control so there's that classic old line media push
[42:58.680 --> 43:04.960]  to worship big media so-called glamorous fancy teleprompter perfect
[43:04.960 --> 43:11.120]  lighting you know big guest media which Glenn Beck only has a two million
[43:11.120 --> 43:18.320]  viewers I mean this radio show now has upwards of three million a day it's a
[43:18.320 --> 43:23.200]  paper tiger it's imaginary and so the much of the article is about how how I
[43:23.200 --> 43:28.240]  want to be the big time I would know no I we have big time information but it
[43:28.240 --> 43:32.240]  isn't about being big time it's about changing the course of the world it's
[43:32.240 --> 43:36.360]  about affecting real change it's about liberty that's what I'm into that's
[43:36.360 --> 43:41.200]  what makes me tick that's why I have passion is because I don't like bullies
[43:41.200 --> 43:45.960]  and tyrants and I don't want to lose my property rights or my family rights or
[43:45.960 --> 43:50.960]  my second amendment rights it's about a fight that I'm dedicated to and I'm
[43:50.960 --> 43:56.000]  proud that I've done it my way and built my own radio system and over 16 years
[43:56.000 --> 44:03.080]  built slowly to this point that's now exploding I'm proud of the fact that I
[44:03.080 --> 44:07.000]  lost 70% or more of my stations when they told me don't talk about 9-11 truth
[44:07.000 --> 44:14.640]  in 2001 and they haven't the article like it was a failure and didn't ever
[44:14.640 --> 44:19.840]  even explain that we've gotten bigger I mean I'm proud I don't hardly know
[44:19.840 --> 44:25.840]  anybody who won't sell out when money's on the table I didn't over and over again
[44:25.840 --> 44:31.520]  I was approached many times and offered the big syndication radio deals and the
[44:31.520 --> 44:37.400]  book deals and the TV deals that would come with it do you understand ladies
[44:37.400 --> 44:40.760]  and gentlemen I'm sure they approach dozens of people but you know they
[44:40.760 --> 44:44.400]  develop these minor leagues of people to go to the big leagues I was approached
[44:44.400 --> 44:50.720]  by the big companies 12 years ago 10 years ago 9 years ago and they've known
[44:50.720 --> 45:00.560]  since don't approach me because I won't sell out and they they wouldn't put that
[45:00.560 --> 45:07.440]  message across you know they and you've got the Rolling Stone writer admittedly
[45:07.440 --> 45:15.840]  an operative now of media matters with that piece what Joe Hagan at the New
[45:15.840 --> 45:22.560]  York Daily News or New York magazine called a stink bomb if that's a stink
[45:22.560 --> 45:36.760]  bomb what is your article pal it's a piece of clichéd sophistry big brother
[45:36.760 --> 45:44.040]  mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's
[45:44.040 --> 45:53.920]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[46:03.120 --> 46:10.560]  I've spent much of the last hour getting into the relationship of the left
[46:10.560 --> 46:15.000]  right power arms of the New World Order based in the United States and Europe
[46:15.000 --> 46:22.160]  and how the two systems are more and more viciously fighting with each other
[46:22.160 --> 46:27.600]  and media matters is openly saying they're gonna launch a guerrilla warfare
[46:27.600 --> 46:33.640]  operation to attempt to bankrupt and destroy Fox News I said to myself and
[46:33.640 --> 46:36.760]  the crew last night when I first saw this political article after the Sunday
[46:36.760 --> 46:41.080]  night radio show was over that this sounded illegal to me and there are some
[46:41.080 --> 46:48.280]  news headlines asking is it breaking the law and Watson is engrossed in a deep
[46:48.280 --> 46:58.480]  report on this tying it in with the vicious hit piece out of New York
[46:58.480 --> 47:04.680]  magazine by Joe Hagan and so it'll probably actually be the start of the
[47:04.680 --> 47:10.320]  next hour before I get into that but you know when you learn about Western
[47:10.320 --> 47:15.120]  governments knowingly from the 40s right through to today murdering our own
[47:15.120 --> 47:19.640]  troops and experiments they know we're going to kill them sterilizing foster
[47:19.640 --> 47:24.360]  children radiating them to death when you learn about the government signing
[47:24.360 --> 47:28.960]  secret deals now public 12 years ago 11 and a half years ago to steal all the
[47:28.960 --> 47:33.720]  death benefits of the troops when you learn about just how ruthless these
[47:33.720 --> 47:38.760]  people are and then you see people making jokes about it and posing as if
[47:38.760 --> 47:49.720]  they're liberal or conservative intellectuals it's extremely disgusting
[47:49.720 --> 47:58.920]  and saddening but it is very exciting to see people waking up and that's why the
[47:58.920 --> 48:03.560]  systems openly pushing internet kill switches openly using the Pentagon and
[48:03.560 --> 48:07.400]  private groups to infiltrate the web and attack anybody that criticizes the
[48:07.400 --> 48:11.080]  globalist because that's the real movement against tyranny not the
[48:11.080 --> 48:15.880]  controlled Democrats on their little mindless reservation not the controlled
[48:15.880 --> 48:26.000]  Republicans in their imaginary fantasy land tied in with all these little soap
[48:26.000 --> 48:31.320]  operas of meaningless pap and disinformation and issues of little
[48:31.320 --> 48:36.120]  or no significance because as people become aware while there's a private
[48:36.120 --> 48:39.480]  bank runs the country while they can do whatever they want while they've got
[48:39.480 --> 48:43.480]  free money for themselves while the Federal Reserve member banks are the
[48:43.480 --> 48:47.080]  ones lobbying to take our private property the Federal Reserve's always
[48:47.080 --> 48:51.160]  lobbying for raising taxes well yeah because then it's paid to them on the
[48:51.160 --> 48:57.160]  interest on the debt once people get that paradigm which is starting to happen
[48:57.160 --> 49:03.000]  over 80% major polls want to abolish the Federal Reserve as that happens their
[49:03.000 --> 49:08.000]  times running out if they can't distract us with all the front puppets and all
[49:08.000 --> 49:14.320]  the buffet of lies they lay out and and in rabbit trails it's game over for the
[49:14.320 --> 49:19.880]  new world order and they're racing to get their electronic tyranny in place
[49:19.880 --> 49:25.120]  they are racing to get their local spy groups in place which they openly admit
[49:25.120 --> 49:29.160]  they're doing they're racing to break our will with the dog training with the
[49:29.160 --> 49:33.880]  TSA putting us in microwave bakers and sticking their hands down our pants
[49:33.880 --> 49:42.760]  they're trying to break our will right down and we're fighting back in fact
[49:42.760 --> 49:48.240]  guys will you repel me that Washington Times article from Sunday that I had I
[49:48.240 --> 49:54.680]  meant to cover I forget the headline about the TSA and the massive resistance
[49:54.680 --> 49:58.840]  at states all over the country to make it criminal for the TSA to touch you
[49:58.840 --> 50:03.640]  through your pants much less inside and the lawsuits being filed by the score
[50:03.640 --> 50:09.800]  and their cities all over the country pulling sodium fluoride out and people
[50:09.800 --> 50:14.840]  are I mean we're on the March the Empire is on the run but I just never
[50:14.840 --> 50:21.280]  imagined myself to be this up front on the tip of the spear and to be the to
[50:21.280 --> 50:26.000]  have the eye of Sauron you know George Soros looking down on me it's it's
[50:26.000 --> 50:31.560]  bizarre I'll get into Fukushima Libby and a lot more
[50:31.560 --> 50:39.920]  he's the T-Rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[50:44.760 --> 50:49.960]  all right we're gonna get into the latest huge developments in and around the
[50:49.960 --> 50:55.160]  nuclear meltdown site in Fukushima Japan the incredibly important developments
[50:55.160 --> 50:59.800]  are dealing with Libya and Obama's speech set for this evening but first I
[50:59.800 --> 51:03.600]  wanted to get into some very positive news there's quite a bit of it but I'm
[51:03.600 --> 51:12.680]  going to limit it to the TSA but but as a or derv to what I'm about to say the
[51:12.680 --> 51:18.880]  globalist are first and foremost confidence men and women and they know
[51:18.880 --> 51:23.640]  how to basically throw things in your face wear fancy suits give themselves
[51:23.640 --> 51:32.200]  big titles and just announce incredibly draconian corrupt despotic things as if
[51:32.200 --> 51:40.600]  it's mother's milk as if it's some type of heavenly nirvana or Valhalla that
[51:40.600 --> 51:46.240]  they're pushing and here's the TSA set up by the federal government nine years
[51:46.240 --> 51:51.240]  ago expanding the train stations bus stations highways take your belt off
[51:51.240 --> 51:54.880]  take your shoes off can't have liquids asking you questions sticking their
[51:54.880 --> 51:59.200]  hands down your pants putting passive brain scanners in some airports putting
[51:59.200 --> 52:03.360]  you in microwave scanners not even following OSHA law not even having
[52:03.360 --> 52:07.840]  radiation test covering it up from Congress telling Congress they have no
[52:07.840 --> 52:13.600]  authority for oversight Homeland Security not giving Congress reports on
[52:13.600 --> 52:22.120]  major Homeland Security initiatives the UN passing a resolution Congress not
[52:22.120 --> 52:29.440]  even being conferred with much less passing a declaration of war or even
[52:29.440 --> 52:34.200]  their own authorization of force resolution it's all about these
[52:34.200 --> 52:40.080]  unelected UN IMF World Bank World Trade Organization XM Bank International Bank
[52:40.080 --> 52:46.840]  of Settlements Groups SPP North American Union Corporate Board giving orders to
[52:46.840 --> 52:52.120]  government the government officials and politicians and bureaucrats are lackies
[52:52.120 --> 52:58.840]  that go in a revolving door from inside their corporations back out into
[52:58.840 --> 53:02.800]  government and you read the SPP documents on the North American Union I
[53:02.800 --> 53:06.840]  talk about these every day because there's a great example of the Fortune
[53:06.840 --> 53:11.480]  100 at a meeting in Banff Canada giving orders to the heads of the state
[53:11.480 --> 53:15.760]  departments there the Interior Departments and the Homeland Security
[53:15.760 --> 53:19.560]  Departments the security services saying this is what you'll do and then the
[53:19.560 --> 53:23.640]  government ratifying it and going and implementing it through the bureaucracy
[53:23.640 --> 53:30.040]  just like the UN Kyoto Treaty is being implemented by California outside of
[53:30.040 --> 53:33.760]  the federal government it's being implemented by cities like Austin
[53:33.760 --> 53:40.040]  circumventing the Congress it's being implemented by the EPA circumnavigating
[53:40.040 --> 53:46.000]  the Congress and so here's the TSA just out in the open saying oh we'll take over
[53:46.000 --> 53:50.120]  your streets you're gonna have to have a worker ID card that we controlled even
[53:50.120 --> 53:53.560]  have a job this is all been announced by Ridge again almost nine years ago now
[53:53.560 --> 54:00.600]  they're trying to roll it out hemispheric travel ID now out for three years it's
[54:00.600 --> 54:07.320]  just all being flaunted and I've heard police chiefs who aren't under federal
[54:07.320 --> 54:12.920]  control state police I've even heard in Texas complaining on on the news saying
[54:12.920 --> 54:17.240]  yeah a state police officer can't pull somebody over without an emergency
[54:17.240 --> 54:22.160]  probable cause they've got a weapon and they and they feel threatened and and
[54:22.160 --> 54:26.280]  you know can't put their hands down their pants I mean you've got to have
[54:26.280 --> 54:29.720]  probable cause you've got to have an emergency situation how do they just
[54:29.720 --> 54:35.240]  herd you in and do this how are the feds declaring jurisdiction over first
[54:35.240 --> 54:39.360]  airports as training centers to train their own people to accept it the police
[54:39.360 --> 54:43.680]  to accept it in the local jurisdiction the public to accept it how do you get
[54:43.680 --> 54:48.760]  away with this they just do it how do they put you in an unapproved radiation
[54:48.760 --> 54:55.360]  booth they just do it and now they've been caught coast to coast robbing people
[54:55.360 --> 55:00.480]  what type of folks do you think want a job sticking their hands down people's
[55:00.480 --> 55:06.400]  pants pulling women's blouses off doing this control freaks and they recruit and
[55:06.400 --> 55:11.960]  promote the control freaks to the highest level I've talked to people in TSA in
[55:11.960 --> 55:16.920]  Austin I've talked to airport administrators I've talked to multiple
[55:16.920 --> 55:22.840]  people three actually in the last six seven years high up inside the Austin
[55:22.840 --> 55:28.680]  Berkshire International Airport system and they say that the head TSA people
[55:28.680 --> 55:33.120]  there are the worst and they're the people who like to harass the women that
[55:33.120 --> 55:36.920]  work there they're the people who like to harass the workers and the pilots
[55:36.920 --> 55:42.320]  they're the people that are on power trips the worst type of control freaks
[55:42.320 --> 55:49.360]  get empowered and turned loose in a tyranny they get to decide what goes on
[55:49.360 --> 55:54.040]  the media just like East Germany they get to decide how you can travel where
[55:54.040 --> 55:58.680]  you can go they get to give jobs to their family this is a new class system
[55:58.680 --> 56:02.960]  being developed the government class the political class that serves the
[56:02.960 --> 56:08.800]  offshore mega banks that are looting the entire planet and waging war against
[56:08.800 --> 56:13.960]  prosperity because they want you broke back and subservient and destitute under
[56:13.960 --> 56:19.200]  their control but here's the good news all over the country hundreds of cities
[56:19.200 --> 56:25.560]  scores of states governors Ventura former governor suing the people are
[56:25.560 --> 56:30.800]  rising up they admit tens of billions a year and it's accelerating is being
[56:30.800 --> 56:35.520]  lost in tourism last year the heads of the tourism associations the hotel
[56:35.520 --> 56:40.880]  associations the travel association said you are killing us Europeans won't come
[56:40.880 --> 56:47.280]  here they won't go through this Europeans are boycotting in Europe or
[56:47.280 --> 56:52.000]  they're trying to put it in this is slave training the pilots have refused to
[56:52.000 --> 56:56.920]  fly they filed suits the TSA said okay we'll quit groping you but not the
[56:56.920 --> 57:02.800]  public see we all think of civil rights as black people versus white people the
[57:02.800 --> 57:07.600]  real 21st century civil rights is the insurance companies write the health
[57:07.600 --> 57:13.000]  care legislation written by the insurance companies Wall Street Journal
[57:13.000 --> 57:17.920]  admitted that the head of the consortium the head lobbyist for the
[57:17.920 --> 57:25.480]  consortium of the health care industry and the insurance companies I read this
[57:25.480 --> 57:28.600]  probably six months ago on air I was in an airport and read it I mean I'd seen
[57:28.600 --> 57:32.120]  it elsewhere but there were the admissions right there in the news
[57:32.120 --> 57:39.160]  article and they wrote it to make 35 million people get insurance to then
[57:39.160 --> 57:42.040]  let the insurance companies through government regulators they control
[57:42.040 --> 57:46.280]  lower the standard and quality of care taking doctors and nurses out of the
[57:46.280 --> 57:50.880]  medical decision equation literally setting up the death panels news week
[57:50.880 --> 57:54.120]  came out with the case for killing granny with it with an image of a plug
[57:54.120 --> 57:59.840]  pulled out of the wall next to a gurney Bill Gates said yes death panels we can
[57:59.840 --> 58:03.840]  hire 10 teachers if we kill granny that's the collectivist model they start
[58:03.840 --> 58:07.720]  cutting the resources creating artificial scarcity and then telling people
[58:07.720 --> 58:12.520]  take something from somebody else and you'll get ahead in the government class
[58:12.520 --> 58:21.400]  it's divide and conquer he who has the gold makes the rule and real civil
[58:21.400 --> 58:27.760]  rights is saying you're not allowed to give thousands and thousands and
[58:27.760 --> 58:33.440]  thousands and thousands of waivers to McDonald's and other fortune 500
[58:33.440 --> 58:37.640]  companies to not have to get insurance but all their competitors do that's
[58:37.640 --> 58:43.080]  economic discrimination what do you think they did against blacks in this
[58:43.080 --> 58:49.080]  country or Native Americans that's the first form that's the type of issues but
[58:49.080 --> 58:52.240]  everybody's looking for black and white to fight with each other vice versa
[58:52.240 --> 58:57.040]  instead of real civil rights violations or all of us being trained to have
[58:57.040 --> 59:01.320]  strangers stick their hands not just on our pants but our children's pants
[59:01.320 --> 59:08.480]  normalizing it roasting us in radiation chambers all of this so here's the good
[59:08.480 --> 59:16.520]  news is out of the Washington Times editorial groping for a TSA solution and
[59:16.520 --> 59:20.560]  this is a Washington Times issued article meaning it's the editorial board
[59:20.560 --> 59:25.080]  the Transportation Security Administration TSA hoped it could avoid
[59:25.080 --> 59:29.360]  public revolt over its intrusive airport security measures by dialing back
[59:29.360 --> 59:33.440]  operations while security was as its peak over Thanksgiving and Christmas
[59:33.440 --> 59:36.560]  holidays see they always apply the pressure if you don't resist they
[59:36.560 --> 59:41.400]  squeeze more when you fight back they back off that's classic warfare tactics
[59:41.400 --> 59:47.320]  they didn't stop more than a dozen federal lawsuits that have since been
[59:47.320 --> 59:51.120]  filed against the agency by airline pilots and former governor among other
[59:51.120 --> 59:56.360]  state lawmakers are also looking for change yeah in Texas you name it near
[59:56.360 --> 1:00:01.720]  unanimous Alaska legislature last week transmitted to the governor and Congress
[1:00:01.720 --> 1:00:05.440]  an official complaint that overzealous transportation security administration
[1:00:05.440 --> 1:00:09.600]  employees have carried out the new procedures in a manner sufficiently
[1:00:09.600 --> 1:00:13.280]  aggressive to raise the level of an inappropriate invasion of personal
[1:00:13.280 --> 1:00:17.360]  privacy for an individual would ordinarily be protected under the
[1:00:17.360 --> 1:00:23.160]  laws of Alaska the nonbinding resolution urges Congress to crack down on TSA
[1:00:23.160 --> 1:00:28.200]  bureaucracy but see they're charged by the unelected homeland security system
[1:00:28.200 --> 1:00:32.520]  that won't even give Congress documents and a president who doesn't even get a
[1:00:32.520 --> 1:00:36.760]  authorization of force from Congress who follows you in orders this is about
[1:00:36.760 --> 1:00:41.480]  administrative law where if possession is nine-tenths and if they can trample
[1:00:41.480 --> 1:00:48.200]  our rights and usurp them they're gone in law you must defend every square inch
[1:00:48.200 --> 1:00:53.480]  of your liberty a house oversight committee last week began to put pressure
[1:00:53.480 --> 1:00:57.800]  on TSA officials you mean a gaggle of crooks getting money from the body
[1:00:57.800 --> 1:01:02.600]  scanners companies who initially balked see they tried to just bluster like
[1:01:02.600 --> 1:01:07.880]  con artists and act like we were crazy balked at an invitation to testify
[1:01:07.880 --> 1:01:12.520]  before the tardy bureaucrats arrive representative John L. Micah say they
[1:01:12.520 --> 1:01:16.160]  showed up late part of their arrogance Florida Republican blasts of the
[1:01:16.160 --> 1:01:19.920]  agency for the indiscriminate use of pornographic whole-body imaging scanners
[1:01:19.920 --> 1:01:25.120]  saying a seventh grader could end up on with a better plan for developing and
[1:01:25.120 --> 1:01:29.960]  utilizing this equipment for a Minnesota governor Jesse Ventura wants to take
[1:01:29.960 --> 1:01:33.520]  the fight directly to Homeland Security Janet de Palotano the easily
[1:01:33.520 --> 1:01:37.160]  recognizable Mr. Ventura flies several times a week and a subject to automatic
[1:01:37.160 --> 1:01:41.600]  enhanced screening now they grab his gendals because he has a titanium hip
[1:01:41.600 --> 1:01:47.560]  implant that sets off a metal detector every time he walks through and it just
[1:01:47.560 --> 1:01:52.720]  goes on from there this should be a no-brainer groping small children
[1:01:52.720 --> 1:01:57.080]  grandmothers and former professional wrestlers does nothing to make this
[1:01:57.080 --> 1:01:59.720]  country more secure it makes the globalist more secure to break our will
[1:01:59.720 --> 1:02:04.040]  and try this for prison induction that's all this is prison induction federal
[1:02:04.040 --> 1:02:07.760]  lawmakers need to do more to hold this rogue agency accountable it's not rogue
[1:02:07.760 --> 1:02:12.560]  the entire bureaucracy the entire Homeland Security system was started out
[1:02:12.560 --> 1:02:16.280]  of the ominous crime bill based on the federal government bombing Oklahoma
[1:02:16.280 --> 1:02:21.760]  City this is a criminal illegitimate group of hijackers masquerading as
[1:02:21.760 --> 1:02:27.600]  government waging in eternal warfare against the people read the declaration
[1:02:27.600 --> 1:02:34.600]  of independence it's a replay of that and more
[1:02:58.600 --> 1:03:06.120]  okay I'm gonna shift gears now into other news but I cannot stress it enough
[1:03:06.120 --> 1:03:11.880]  that the social engineers and control of our society are attempting to radically
[1:03:11.880 --> 1:03:17.880]  revolutionize our society into one of open-territy selling it under the guise
[1:03:17.880 --> 1:03:24.800]  of so-called security and as Benjamin Franklin said best those that give up
[1:03:24.800 --> 1:03:30.960]  their liberties for supposed security deserve and will get neither you will
[1:03:30.960 --> 1:03:36.840]  not get liberty will not get security when you allow tyranny to grow tyranny
[1:03:36.840 --> 1:03:41.840]  is a disease that every society every empire every country gets it is the
[1:03:41.840 --> 1:03:45.800]  norm it's like if you live long enough you're gonna get heart disease or
[1:03:45.800 --> 1:03:52.280]  cancer and very few countries or republics have ever gone past 200 years
[1:03:52.280 --> 1:04:01.080]  235 years is about as old as a system gets and of course we're 235 years old
[1:04:01.080 --> 1:04:07.400]  and we've been co-opted by the very slick corporate management systems that
[1:04:07.400 --> 1:04:11.680]  are masters at lobbying and special interest but the special interests have
[1:04:11.680 --> 1:04:17.600]  actually taken over the entire system if you go back and look at Europe and
[1:04:17.600 --> 1:04:23.120]  study the history of the Middle Ages into the Renaissance many baronies many
[1:04:23.120 --> 1:04:27.400]  sub regions and many times entire countries would be taken over within
[1:04:27.400 --> 1:04:32.360]  just a generation by bankers and they would simply start giving loans to a
[1:04:32.360 --> 1:04:38.560]  young prince or to all the princes secretly because their family wouldn't
[1:04:38.560 --> 1:04:42.400]  agree with it and by the time the king died or the queen died the bankers would
[1:04:42.400 --> 1:04:49.200]  then own the prince they would then own the country and the banks would loan to
[1:04:49.200 --> 1:04:54.120]  both sides and would start a war to then know that during that war both
[1:04:54.120 --> 1:04:58.960]  countries bordering each other would be fighting for their lives of their system
[1:04:58.960 --> 1:05:05.360]  and that they would squeeze the public to any degree needed to fund their
[1:05:05.360 --> 1:05:11.280]  family staying in power and if you study the Chinese emperors this happened
[1:05:11.280 --> 1:05:15.920]  over and over again humans behave the same over and over again if you study
[1:05:15.920 --> 1:05:21.600]  the Mesoamerican tribes the Aztecs at the end it was the same with the druid
[1:05:21.600 --> 1:05:27.920]  systems you normally had a priest class of propaganda manipulators who controlled
[1:05:27.920 --> 1:05:34.480]  the royal class who themselves had just been the best warriors it was brains
[1:05:34.480 --> 1:05:39.960]  over brawn and so the globalist are just a collection of scammers and control
[1:05:39.960 --> 1:05:44.520]  freaks and confidence men and they're so confident they believe their own
[1:05:44.520 --> 1:05:49.080]  garbage they can make money off nuclear systems they're gonna put them in
[1:05:49.080 --> 1:05:52.680]  they're gonna do open-air testing they don't care if their own families get
[1:05:52.680 --> 1:05:57.800]  increased cancer they believe their own sense of infallibility of invincibility
[1:05:57.800 --> 1:06:02.920]  then when the radiation gets released now confirmed at 100,000 times safe
[1:06:02.920 --> 1:06:07.000]  levels now blowing out to sea hopefully most of it will go into the ocean but
[1:06:07.000 --> 1:06:16.120]  then they'll get to us via the seafood they just come out and arrogantly make
[1:06:16.120 --> 1:06:21.880]  in what what looks like ridiculous statements remember when the guardian
[1:06:21.880 --> 1:06:24.920]  and the British government is part of a consortium you can look at the sponsors
[1:06:24.920 --> 1:06:29.320]  funded those TV ads that showed children refusing to cut their carbon
[1:06:29.320 --> 1:06:34.680]  footprints so the teacher detonates bombs in their desk and murders all of them
[1:06:34.680 --> 1:06:39.120]  they said yes we need to start killing people yes we need environmental
[1:06:39.120 --> 1:06:46.800]  fascism yes we need airborne released Ebola as Dr. Pionka UT said yes we need
[1:06:46.800 --> 1:06:52.440]  to kill the 1996 UN biological diversity assessment says we must bring back war
[1:06:52.440 --> 1:06:58.480]  and famine to reduce population the State Department of Random 200 the
[1:06:58.480 --> 1:07:04.040]  biological diversity assessment put out by the CIA and Henry Kissinger says we'll
[1:07:04.040 --> 1:07:08.680]  use wars and famine to reduce population this is their excuse for all the
[1:07:08.680 --> 1:07:13.600]  bloodletting and say no masochistic evil that they engage in they love it they
[1:07:13.600 --> 1:07:17.920]  stated it's their Bible they compete with each other over who's more ruthless
[1:07:17.920 --> 1:07:21.920]  and Kissinger makes statements about the troops being dumb animals that they're
[1:07:21.920 --> 1:07:28.360]  there to die they love it they praise mouse a tongue David Rockefeller does in
[1:07:28.360 --> 1:07:33.240]  the New York Times and how great the system is and the CFR says China is the
[1:07:33.240 --> 1:07:38.880]  model and so is Singapore open tyrannies and you say I don't want tyranny I
[1:07:38.880 --> 1:07:42.520]  don't want a hundred thousand times safe levels of radiation which even the
[1:07:42.520 --> 1:07:45.760]  Washington Post admits will kill the people in a matter of months who've
[1:07:45.760 --> 1:07:53.400]  come in contact with it and you say so what George Monbiot we're gonna get into
[1:07:53.400 --> 1:07:56.680]  the reactor when we come back I'm finally gonna get to it nuclear expert
[1:07:56.680 --> 1:08:00.440]  calls global warming alarmist Monbiot criminally irresponsible for down
[1:08:00.440 --> 1:08:06.120]  blaming Fukushima and he came out and he says I love nuclear I love after
[1:08:06.120 --> 1:08:10.480]  Fukushima I love it these are statements and it's meant to make you go
[1:08:10.480 --> 1:08:17.800]  huh what I'm crazy cuz I don't I don't love radiation and her political so-called
[1:08:17.800 --> 1:08:34.040]  enemy and culture comes out says the same thing okay getting into the Fukushima
[1:08:34.040 --> 1:08:39.200]  situation first I want to get into Monbiot
[1:08:39.200 --> 1:08:49.240]  dr. Christopher Busby a chemical physicist who advises the BBC advises
[1:08:49.240 --> 1:08:57.920]  the EU the other businesses we've had on have confirmed and confirmed what he
[1:08:57.920 --> 1:09:03.560]  has said we know what happened with the right at a million dead from cancers
[1:09:03.560 --> 1:09:11.000]  associated with the Chernobyl situation we know from Hiroshima and Nakasaki the
[1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:17.120]  massive increases in leukemias and other cancers breast cancer we know
[1:09:17.120 --> 1:09:25.000]  worldwide cancer is up and Busby had to point out that uranium and other types
[1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:30.480]  of radioactive isotopes are some of the most devastating to sperm counts in men
[1:09:30.480 --> 1:09:34.000]  and also fertility in women and that fertility in all of these nuclear
[1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:40.480]  powered countries is plunging now remember about four months ago CBS news
[1:09:40.480 --> 1:09:44.000]  out of Houston and then after that a whole bunch of newspapers every major
[1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:48.720]  paper in Texas we covered it here reported that in fact guys let's put the
[1:09:48.720 --> 1:09:55.000]  headline up state covered up radioactive isotopes in Texas water then it
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:58.680]  turned out it was in every major state but they didn't say why they covered it
[1:09:58.680 --> 1:10:03.880]  up they didn't say why the radiation was there well because most of the mines
[1:10:03.880 --> 1:10:09.400]  that they mined the phosphates out of that they then use in fertilizer they
[1:10:09.400 --> 1:10:12.840]  they mine the chemicals they need for the fertilizer out of limestone deposits
[1:10:12.840 --> 1:10:19.280]  those also at many of the facilities double as uranium mines uranium is in
[1:10:19.280 --> 1:10:28.960]  the same strata so is the purified derivatives of radon and a whole bunch
[1:10:28.960 --> 1:10:33.320]  of other isotopes and there it was all over the Texas news again we'll just
[1:10:33.320 --> 1:10:40.960]  search radioactive elements in Texas water there it is contaminated water in
[1:10:40.960 --> 1:10:46.640]  major Texas cities has radioactive elements and that is out of KH oh you
[1:10:46.640 --> 1:10:53.680]  I believe that is the CBS yeah that's a K E N S out of San Antonio carrying
[1:10:53.680 --> 1:10:59.440]  another stations report and you can go read that but again a minor blip well
[1:10:59.440 --> 1:11:07.840]  what have we told you years before with chemist and top toxicologist like Dr.
[1:11:07.840 --> 1:11:14.120]  Paul Conant and others what is his book cover uranium and other isotopes in the
[1:11:14.120 --> 1:11:18.320]  water they mine it and put it in the water there's hundreds of different
[1:11:18.320 --> 1:11:23.000]  things in this stuff not just sodium fluoride that seven-fold in men's
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:27.240]  cancers three-fold in women don't believe me on that just search fluoride
[1:11:27.240 --> 1:11:34.960]  bone cancer AP Reuters BBC ABC just letters by the vast majority of EPA
[1:11:34.960 --> 1:11:39.360]  scientists themselves a decade ago or 11 years ago and then five years ago and
[1:11:39.360 --> 1:11:44.160]  then a year ago going and testifying and saying why are you doing this it's
[1:11:44.160 --> 1:11:51.840]  deadly and see for me it's not a joke like it is for the writer at New York
[1:11:51.840 --> 1:11:58.800]  magazine attacking me or for the writer at Rolling Stone making jokes attacking
[1:11:58.800 --> 1:12:04.600]  it's not funny for me see I know what they're doing and you could say well
[1:12:04.600 --> 1:12:08.400]  they don't mean to sterilize this okay well it's having that effect and it
[1:12:08.400 --> 1:12:13.280]  turns out they've known and have covered it up these are not leaking reactors
[1:12:13.280 --> 1:12:18.080]  these are not water supplies next to uranium enrichment facilities nuclear
[1:12:18.080 --> 1:12:24.960]  weapons facilities no they're putting it in the stinking water and I just put it
[1:12:24.960 --> 1:12:30.960]  out and I'm the cook as I cover CBS News San Antonio CBS News ABC News
[1:12:30.960 --> 1:12:37.160]  Houston Austin American Statesmen these people at the Austin American Statesmen
[1:12:37.160 --> 1:12:42.040]  at CBS News they put out a reporter to about the state covering up radiation in
[1:12:42.040 --> 1:12:46.040]  every major city in town and then don't ask why was there a cover-up just oh
[1:12:46.040 --> 1:12:52.200]  there's a cover-up and why is the uranium in there why is the radium in
[1:12:52.200 --> 1:12:59.880]  there why because they put it there and let's just say they're negligent and
[1:12:59.880 --> 1:13:04.240]  and just didn't notice what they were mining it out of really the scientists
[1:13:04.240 --> 1:13:09.440]  the big companies that pushed 60 years ago to put this in all our water see you
[1:13:09.440 --> 1:13:13.920]  take one story like that it discredits the entire system just like they know
[1:13:13.920 --> 1:13:18.320]  do you up until 91 they wouldn't let the troops use it now they're using it all
[1:13:18.320 --> 1:13:22.080]  over the world they're using it in Libya they're using it at shooting ranges now
[1:13:22.080 --> 1:13:28.280]  they're not just using it at the proving grounds fired out of tanks Vulcan
[1:13:28.280 --> 1:13:36.480]  Gatling guns out of 810 warthogs no now it's in 223 it's in 308 NATO it's in 50
[1:13:36.480 --> 1:13:40.720]  Cal and they're using it at bases everywhere it ignites going out the
[1:13:40.720 --> 1:13:47.640]  barrel the troops are getting deadly dosages of it every time they fire and
[1:13:47.640 --> 1:13:52.840]  then you wonder why Rolling Stone comes out with their left cover oh they
[1:13:52.840 --> 1:13:57.960]  support the George Soros type crowd with all the big wars and bombing Serbia with
[1:13:57.960 --> 1:14:02.040]  DU but then they still got to have their left cover being against war what do
[1:14:02.040 --> 1:14:07.280]  you think war is what's it good for absolutely nothing the kill team a new
[1:14:07.280 --> 1:14:11.760]  report how US soldiers in Afghanistan murdered innocent civilians mutated
[1:14:11.760 --> 1:14:15.760]  their corpses and how their officers failed to stop them well they didn't
[1:14:15.760 --> 1:14:20.040]  fail to stop them from executing Pat Tillman plus an exclusive look at the
[1:14:20.040 --> 1:14:26.840]  war crime photos censored by the Pentagon they got little kids Rolling Stone
[1:14:26.840 --> 1:14:30.880]  reveals how US troops murdered Afghan civilians soldiers cut off boys fingers
[1:14:30.880 --> 1:14:34.760]  and kept it as trophies video captures US troops cheering as airstrikes kills
[1:14:34.760 --> 1:14:39.040]  two Afghan civilians you know you had to have a righteous war if we were
[1:14:39.040 --> 1:14:42.680]  actually being attacked and you accidentally killed a child you should
[1:14:42.680 --> 1:14:46.640]  break down and cry because you're a man because you're tender because you're so
[1:14:46.640 --> 1:14:51.360]  strong you love the weak not like it's a video game I'll look we just blew up a
[1:14:51.360 --> 1:14:57.480]  whole village of men women and children aha well the globalists go aha take
[1:14:57.480 --> 1:15:02.000]  their death benefits steal it aha have the troops breathe DU you think you've
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:09.560]  been given all this power to murder and love death and that tortures sexy because
[1:15:09.560 --> 1:15:19.960]  the power ends there the darkness ends there it starts with you but but let's
[1:15:19.960 --> 1:15:23.000]  shift gears back to the globalist in their system of death and nihilistic
[1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:27.200]  destruction here's Paul Joseph Watson's article from this morning nuclear
[1:15:27.200 --> 1:15:31.520]  expert calls global warming alarmist Monbiot criminally irresponsible for
[1:15:31.520 --> 1:15:35.040]  downplaying Fukushima prominent nuclear and radiation expert dr. Christopher
[1:15:35.040 --> 1:15:40.560]  Busby has slammed British global warming alarmist George Monbiot a guy who's
[1:15:40.560 --> 1:15:44.360]  called for green tyranny by the way criminally irresponsible for writing a
[1:15:44.360 --> 1:15:48.760]  series of articles for the Guardian in which Monbiot downplays the threat of
[1:15:48.760 --> 1:15:53.080]  radiation from the stricken Fukushima reactor plant in a bid to shore up his
[1:15:53.080 --> 1:15:57.320]  claim about man-made climate change being a far deadlier concerned carbon
[1:15:57.320 --> 1:16:01.480]  dioxide in the wake of Fukushima we have seen numerous self-proclaimed
[1:16:01.480 --> 1:16:04.360]  environmentalists who are normally so quick to raise the alarm about
[1:16:04.360 --> 1:16:08.440]  devastation caused by man-made global warming actually downplaying environmental
[1:16:08.440 --> 1:16:13.920]  concerns attached to Fukushima crisis radiation and nuclear power in general
[1:16:13.920 --> 1:16:18.640]  chief among them is prominent British environmentalist George Monbiot who
[1:16:18.640 --> 1:16:21.680]  openly calls for world government and public essays just like George Monbiot
[1:16:21.680 --> 1:16:24.600]  global government and you'll get all those big articles about it but we're
[1:16:24.600 --> 1:16:27.520]  still cooks for not wanting it see it doesn't exist he plays this mind game
[1:16:27.520 --> 1:16:30.280]  I'm for world government but you're not allowed to be against it and if you are
[1:16:30.280 --> 1:16:33.280]  we'll write articles about you saying you're crazy like the Guardians done many
[1:16:33.280 --> 1:16:37.640]  times hey I got this IMF report saying you set up the collapse and we're gonna
[1:16:37.640 --> 1:16:41.320]  try to cut off our resources and our coal plants and do all this hey I don't
[1:16:41.320 --> 1:16:45.160]  want to be a slave shut up it doesn't exist dangerous person did you cause the
[1:16:45.160 --> 1:16:48.280]  Gifford shooting are you some type of violent person thank goodness we've got
[1:16:48.280 --> 1:16:53.400]  Cass Sunstein going after you maybe you should be arrested just open tyrants a
[1:16:53.400 --> 1:16:58.720]  bunch of weak pansies jumping around like fairies telling me how I'm their
[1:16:58.720 --> 1:17:03.600]  slave no you little piece of trash I'm not your slave I'm red-blooded I got a
[1:17:03.600 --> 1:17:08.440]  big heart pumping blood I'm strong my ancestors were strong and we're gonna
[1:17:08.440 --> 1:17:14.360]  rouse and rise free humanity to identify who you are and as you wage war
[1:17:14.360 --> 1:17:23.960]  against us 1776 you and and culture and all are you telling us the
[1:17:23.960 --> 1:17:29.120]  radiation is good for us you telling us death is good for us abortion and one
[1:17:29.120 --> 1:17:33.160]  child policies are good we're not drinking out of your feted filthy pus
[1:17:33.160 --> 1:17:39.000]  filled cup your goblet of death we recognize your slimy weakness and that's
[1:17:39.000 --> 1:17:42.360]  why you wage war against strength and the family and everything beautiful
[1:17:42.360 --> 1:17:46.520]  because you're a bunch of twisted servile worms who've turned yourself over to
[1:17:46.520 --> 1:17:51.560]  pure evil and I openly rebuke you I openly call you out before God and
[1:17:51.560 --> 1:17:55.960]  everyone else and I pray that the masses fully break their conditioning and the
[1:17:55.960 --> 1:18:01.200]  spell they're under and recognize you for what you are a 21st century green
[1:18:01.200 --> 1:18:06.480]  Hitler calling for global domination through a corporate creeping structure
[1:18:06.480 --> 1:18:16.000]  that strangles free humanity calling you out you piece of trash you maggot right
[1:18:16.000 --> 1:18:22.800]  out of the gates of Hades go back to Hades where you came from crawl back
[1:18:22.800 --> 1:18:33.280]  there but God's gonna judge you you know God judges twice during this life it
[1:18:33.280 --> 1:18:37.080]  comes back on you you report you so and when you die there's two judgments
[1:18:37.080 --> 1:18:42.680]  there's two comings I wouldn't want to be you in the type of black bloody
[1:18:42.680 --> 1:18:46.320]  treasure you're taking on the chains you're wrapping around your soul for
[1:18:46.320 --> 1:18:55.000]  eternity the big chest with the bloody silver you drag behind you telling people
[1:18:55.000 --> 1:18:59.160]  that families are bad telling people radiation is good because you love the
[1:18:59.160 --> 1:19:04.640]  infertility it creates not just against humans but all life the deformity the
[1:19:04.640 --> 1:19:09.840]  pain the suffering children that I can see in my mind's eye by the millions
[1:19:09.840 --> 1:19:14.640]  that have died from radiation poisoning poor little decent sweet three four
[1:19:14.640 --> 1:19:19.440]  five six-year-olds with that light of life and humanity damn it they're
[1:19:19.440 --> 1:19:24.040]  keep falling out vomiting dying of cancers never getting to grow old never
[1:19:24.040 --> 1:19:27.920]  getting to have children and love and passion and grandchildren and all the
[1:19:27.920 --> 1:19:32.400]  good things they had because you people had to kill them you people had to suck
[1:19:32.400 --> 1:19:38.560]  the life out of them for your stinking satanic egos I declare eternal war
[1:19:38.560 --> 1:19:44.160]  against you all of my humanity all of the strength of my ancestors all of the
[1:19:44.160 --> 1:19:49.640]  strength that God gives me we will defeat you humanity will not let you
[1:19:49.640 --> 1:19:54.080]  prevail you will not keep humanity from its destiny to populate the stars and
[1:19:54.080 --> 1:19:59.360]  become what God envisions for us you will fail you have failed from the
[1:19:59.360 --> 1:20:06.640]  foundations of the creation of earth and you know it laugh all you want but in
[1:20:06.640 --> 1:20:12.000]  your gut in your soul in the remnants that are left of it you giggle that
[1:20:12.000 --> 1:20:19.040]  mirth-filled lie that acid-spilling stench because you can feel the mouth of
[1:20:19.040 --> 1:20:28.520]  hell that maw opening you can feel your soul stretching thin as you are sucked
[1:20:28.520 --> 1:20:35.600]  into eternity to be damned to be amongst your own kind truly a hell in its of
[1:20:35.600 --> 1:20:41.600]  itself no longer decent beautiful humanity to wage war upon but nothing
[1:20:41.600 --> 1:20:49.920]  but your kind together forever because it is what you are you are children of
[1:20:49.920 --> 1:20:59.320]  death you are children of disease and theft and pain and crippled destruction
[1:20:59.320 --> 1:21:14.040]  you wish to cripple humanity you yourselves are crippled all of you all
[1:21:14.040 --> 1:21:18.600]  of you who willfully serve darkness who willfully try to keep people in the
[1:21:18.600 --> 1:21:24.160]  dark who willfully try to dumb people down committing the ultimate crime in
[1:21:24.160 --> 1:21:29.160]  your jealous envy of the strong that's why you talk about eugenics and the
[1:21:29.160 --> 1:21:33.000]  elite all day yeah look at the five British families and the British
[1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:39.680]  monarchy test who bred the wedgewoods and the galtons and the other families
[1:21:39.680 --> 1:21:48.120]  together the Huxleys the Darwin's in those superman breeding test over 70
[1:21:48.120 --> 1:21:51.960]  years by the end of it almost all the children were born dead or they weren't
[1:21:51.960 --> 1:21:56.880]  they were criminally insane the few that survived are now top captains of the new
[1:21:56.880 --> 1:22:06.880]  world order that's who you are you run from the light you hate the light you
[1:22:06.880 --> 1:22:12.160]  hate anything good anything beautiful anything wholesome green fields blue
[1:22:12.160 --> 1:22:18.440]  skies anything decent is anathema to you like a cross and holy water to a
[1:22:18.440 --> 1:22:23.480]  vampire you run from it you flee from it you flee from goodness because the
[1:22:23.480 --> 1:22:33.600]  wicked flee when none pursue that's one of my favorite quotes since I was a
[1:22:33.600 --> 1:22:42.400]  child no I didn't get it from the Cohen brothers movie true grit I can't even
[1:22:42.400 --> 1:22:48.880]  look at mom be out the smirking camouflage of the spindly necked liberal
[1:22:48.880 --> 1:22:53.840]  not a liberal but a monster not a liberal but a carrion crow who feast on
[1:22:53.840 --> 1:23:01.160]  the detritus of world government not a humanitarian but a monster not a teacher
[1:23:01.160 --> 1:23:16.480]  but a deceiver not a leader but a sniper a crawling ugly thing a creature
[1:23:16.480 --> 1:23:23.320]  that eats off a fallen civilization a creature that lust for lack of knowledge
[1:23:23.320 --> 1:23:28.880]  who lust for a world where their lives are king where everyone must supplicate
[1:23:28.880 --> 1:23:35.200]  and prostrate themselves before you I refused a bow to your TSA I refused a
[1:23:35.200 --> 1:23:39.360]  bow to your new world order I refused to bow to your chemical assault and your
[1:23:39.360 --> 1:23:44.840]  electromagnetic assault and your radiological assault I refuse to have
[1:23:44.840 --> 1:23:49.720]  you tell me poison is life that black is white that up is down that war is
[1:23:49.720 --> 1:23:58.880]  peace that freedom is slavery here's what's going on right now in Japan
[1:23:58.880 --> 1:24:07.800]  exactly as we first warned 16 days ago on day two when Fukushima number one
[1:24:07.800 --> 1:24:16.240]  blue sky high then Fukushima number three two weeks ago today multiple reactor
[1:24:16.240 --> 1:24:22.240]  course shattered plutonium oozing out in the water supply neutron beams blasting
[1:24:22.240 --> 1:24:27.280]  the entire surrounding area with radiation so powerful it's even visible
[1:24:27.280 --> 1:24:33.440]  at night reportedly the blue light the radiation so deadly you can even see it
[1:24:33.440 --> 1:24:38.200]  but mom the art tries to cast his little pathetic spell have we done them down
[1:24:38.200 --> 1:24:43.440]  enough for me to do this oh I'm Harry Potter you don't see it radiation's
[1:24:43.440 --> 1:24:48.680]  good he actually came out in these quotes and said oh after seeing Fukushima
[1:24:48.680 --> 1:24:55.080]  I've decided I'm completely pro nuclear it's no big deal and because I have a
[1:24:55.080 --> 1:25:00.160]  lisping English accent and because the bilgeberg group likes me and everyone's
[1:25:00.160 --> 1:25:06.400]  going to believe me now why why he might even be so mommy art someday and
[1:25:06.400 --> 1:25:12.240]  he told us the sky was the sky was red instead of blue what a little genius
[1:25:12.240 --> 1:25:22.840]  Lord mommy art is more radioactive water spills at Japan nuclear plant
[1:25:22.840 --> 1:25:28.160]  associated press radiation levels at Japan nuclear plant reach new highs for
[1:25:28.160 --> 1:25:33.560]  1600 times safe levels last Wednesday by Friday 10,000 times now as of last night
[1:25:33.560 --> 1:25:38.840]  the Japanese government admits 100,000 times safe radioactive levels that go
[1:25:38.840 --> 1:25:45.640]  under report that any time around this dose will cause about half of those
[1:25:45.640 --> 1:25:52.080]  exposed to die will eventually kill about half of those exposed oh after
[1:25:52.080 --> 1:26:03.120]  seeing Fukushima I decided I like I like a nuclear power now I'm a spindly
[1:26:03.120 --> 1:26:08.400]  little twit I was beat up on the playground as a child so now I've joined
[1:26:08.400 --> 1:26:13.720]  the eggheads and we poison people and we we take control of their society to
[1:26:13.720 --> 1:26:25.280]  sneaky cowardly ways I'm showing everyone how powerful I am lying to don't worry
[1:26:25.280 --> 1:26:33.820]  this show is documented Alex Jones on the GCN radio network so the workers at
[1:26:33.820 --> 1:26:39.160]  Fukushima are working five-hour shifts and it's reported that they're getting
[1:26:39.160 --> 1:26:45.600]  about 1,000 milli sieverts per hour so that would be five thousand milli
[1:26:45.600 --> 1:26:51.920]  sieverts absorbed per shift and even the Washington Post admits that absorbed
[1:26:51.920 --> 1:26:57.200]  fairly rapidly will eventually kill about half of those exposed what do you
[1:26:57.200 --> 1:27:01.360]  think now a week and a half ago the head of the plant broke down crying saying
[1:27:01.360 --> 1:27:06.680]  he couldn't be part of the cover-up and that quote people were going to die by
[1:27:06.680 --> 1:27:09.840]  the way where are the local medical reports we've gotten calls saying people
[1:27:09.840 --> 1:27:14.080]  are vomiting and red-faced over a week ago where are the reports there are no
[1:27:14.080 --> 1:27:17.400]  medical reports see the Japanese I guess they get stoic to just go to the
[1:27:17.400 --> 1:27:21.800]  hospital and die of radiation exposure but that'll come out later when it's a
[1:27:21.800 --> 1:27:28.680]  minor footnote the news oh yeah like everything else and see we're not
[1:27:28.680 --> 1:27:32.440]  supposed to get mad and have our humanity rise up in us to defend
[1:27:32.440 --> 1:27:36.440]  ourselves we're not supposed to be red-blooded we're not supposed to show
[1:27:36.440 --> 1:27:40.480]  the globalist our teeth and say we're committed against you and we recognize
[1:27:40.480 --> 1:27:45.520]  you as the enemy of old the tyranny the control freak the king rat the maggots
[1:27:45.520 --> 1:27:51.200]  the brutes we're supposed to lay down and lick their boots because they're the
[1:27:51.200 --> 1:27:56.840]  officials the authorities and all the other ridiculous titles they give
[1:27:56.840 --> 1:28:02.160]  themselves meanwhile the US military what was it 12 days ago just three or
[1:28:02.160 --> 1:28:07.200]  four days into this pulled all US military personnel out of the area had
[1:28:07.200 --> 1:28:12.160]  the fleet run 200 miles south and now CNN reported last Wednesday they're
[1:28:12.160 --> 1:28:15.760]  considering forced evacuation and we've gotten calls that that's already going
[1:28:15.760 --> 1:28:20.800]  on as of last week of all Americans and major airlines won't fly in to the
[1:28:20.800 --> 1:28:25.240]  central or northern area and all these other big aid agencies have pulled out
[1:28:25.240 --> 1:28:31.720]  but guess who doesn't care about their employees CNBC Goldman Sachs employees
[1:28:31.720 --> 1:28:38.080]  told not to leave Japan oh no I'm afraid they're going with mombiots take just
[1:28:38.080 --> 1:28:43.200]  like the troops I go ahead and use that D you it's not bad for you we say so I
[1:28:43.200 --> 1:28:48.200]  say the Goldman Sachs exec shall all go be part of the cleanup crew getting
[1:28:48.200 --> 1:28:55.240]  their 5,000 milli sieverts during their work oh we still haven't gotten a call
[1:28:55.240 --> 1:28:59.720]  back from Ann Coulter about going and giving a speech at Fukushima she says
[1:28:59.720 --> 1:29:05.120]  it's good for you though and that you won't get cancer but Goldman Sachs
[1:29:05.120 --> 1:29:11.720]  employees told not to leave Japan at least four Goldman Sachs executives
[1:29:11.720 --> 1:29:17.320]  flew to Japan last week to speak with nervous expat employees about
[1:29:17.320 --> 1:29:20.960]  radiation fears according to a person familiar with the situation they also
[1:29:20.960 --> 1:29:26.440]  conveyed another message don't leave Japan and don't leave Tokyo and it goes
[1:29:26.440 --> 1:29:31.200]  on to say that they will be kept there and that is just the way it is and
[1:29:31.200 --> 1:29:34.480]  Obama says don't worry about radiation here either even though it's in
[1:29:34.480 --> 1:29:41.440]  Massachusetts it's been found now in all 50 states that found in Europe radio
[1:29:41.440 --> 1:29:52.080]  active iodine no problem and now Monbiot here's a quote as a result of the
[1:29:52.080 --> 1:29:57.120]  disaster at Fukushima I'm no longer nuclear neutral I now support the
[1:29:57.120 --> 1:30:05.200]  technology added Monbiot of course I imagine when he goes to his club to
[1:30:05.200 --> 1:30:10.000]  have a to have a pint of beer he sits around with the other eugenicist and
[1:30:10.000 --> 1:30:13.720]  laughs they think we're liberals isn't it funny
[1:30:13.720 --> 1:30:19.000]  Wilford there's nothing these rabble won't buy we're moving forward to get
[1:30:19.000 --> 1:30:26.040]  rid of the little scums our conditioning programs are going quite well
[1:30:26.040 --> 1:30:29.920]  showing the school children videos of children being murdered who don't accept
[1:30:29.920 --> 1:30:32.960]  the carbon taxes in the United States they have even better way of doing it
[1:30:32.960 --> 1:30:37.560]  they have drills were unannounced military personnel arrive screaming with
[1:30:37.560 --> 1:30:42.040]  loaded weapons and five and six year olds devocate themselves and it's even
[1:30:42.040 --> 1:30:45.880]  better the parents are then told it was done because homeschooling groups might
[1:30:45.880 --> 1:30:50.200]  attack and kill them they've been psychologically imprinted on the pro
[1:30:50.200 --> 1:30:54.520]  homeschooling groups and gun groups and not on us oppressing them the giant
[1:30:54.520 --> 1:31:01.680]  pre-education camp system is going worldwide it's beautiful oh we love it

[1:31:20.720 --> 1:31:24.360]  alex jones
[1:31:27.560 --> 1:31:31.600]  we are live my friends now in the hour number three notice I'm not taking any
[1:31:31.600 --> 1:31:39.880]  calls because I'm wound up coming up at T-minus 30 minutes we've got Larry
[1:31:39.880 --> 1:31:43.680]  Pratt joining us about a Obama Justice Department false flag shipping guns in

[1:32:13.440 --> 1:32:20.480]  kill roughly half of people very quickly and no reports of radiation sickness
[1:32:20.480 --> 1:32:25.920]  because the good doctors in Japan will obviously follow orders it's seen as a
[1:32:25.920 --> 1:32:30.960]  virtue but some will break down the Japanese are very stoic but then tend to
[1:32:30.960 --> 1:32:36.080]  break down when they're in public if they're lying their honor at one point
[1:32:36.080 --> 1:32:41.160]  kicks in and they can't do it Americans on average more and more would just lie
[1:32:41.160 --> 1:32:45.280]  to themselves and say people dying around them are loving and that it was
[1:32:45.280 --> 1:32:50.920]  nutritious the Japanese know when they lie on average and they have a problem
[1:32:50.920 --> 1:32:54.800]  with it of course I oversimplify America is still full of some of the best
[1:32:54.800 --> 1:32:59.520]  people out there Watson was gonna churn out in two hours a response to the
[1:32:59.520 --> 1:33:07.120]  sickening New York magazine report and I will get if he doesn't cower Joe Hagan
[1:33:07.120 --> 1:33:10.960]  on I'm gonna go ahead and get the Rolling Stone writer on I'll be quite
[1:33:10.960 --> 1:33:15.040]  honest I hadn't read the whole article until just a week or so ago I read
[1:33:15.040 --> 1:33:19.600]  skandover and said that's a headpiece but better than some and I mean I guess
[1:33:19.600 --> 1:33:23.560]  this could be worse at least you know these things are well-written but I
[1:33:23.560 --> 1:33:28.440]  don't just cover this to talk about myself a lot of times I don't cover
[1:33:28.440 --> 1:33:33.080]  media coverage of what we're doing is because it's so vapid and not educational
[1:33:33.080 --> 1:33:38.160]  and informative revealing descriptive
[1:33:39.880 --> 1:33:53.960]  not provoking but this dovetails with media matters war against Fox they say
[1:33:53.960 --> 1:33:57.320]  that they're going to launch a guerrilla warfare and sabotage operation
[1:33:57.320 --> 1:34:01.400]  to destroy Fox I said I was gonna launch a guerrilla warfare and sabotage
[1:34:01.400 --> 1:34:04.800]  operation against the Austin Police Department I would expect to be arrested
[1:34:04.800 --> 1:34:10.560]  because that would be a call to criminal action I'm not of course calling for that
[1:34:10.560 --> 1:34:14.360]  though Glenn Beck may play it out of context as he did last week against me
[1:34:14.360 --> 1:34:22.440]  whatever but it is a call to criminal action and I said that last night to my
[1:34:22.440 --> 1:34:25.840]  crew I didn't see it till after the Sunday show was over the examiner the
[1:34:25.840 --> 1:34:32.000]  Washington examiner gets it right is media matters breaking the law is media
[1:34:32.000 --> 1:34:36.120]  matters breaking the law in its war on Fox news did we ever post links to this
[1:34:36.120 --> 1:34:40.480]  politico and this examiner on info wars.com and present planet.com I don't
[1:34:40.480 --> 1:34:45.400]  think I even saw these up there we need to post links to these everybody can see
[1:34:45.400 --> 1:34:49.000]  him we just we call one of the riders up front when we talked him during the
[1:34:49.000 --> 1:34:52.480]  break it may be up there I just have not seen it I would think something like
[1:34:52.480 --> 1:34:56.640]  that I think something like that would be of the greatest import perhaps we can
[1:34:56.640 --> 1:34:59.800]  write an article about it with a full spectrum analysis and of course that
[1:34:59.800 --> 1:35:03.960]  integrates in with by George it's Soros World Order billionaire steps up funding
[1:35:03.960 --> 1:35:08.080]  to diminish importance of US economy and US currency with a new Bretton Woods
[1:35:08.080 --> 1:35:14.480]  meeting that he's pushing for and Cass Sunstein calls for arresting people that
[1:35:14.480 --> 1:35:20.040]  don't agree with the government and he's he's offhandedly appraised in the
[1:35:20.040 --> 1:35:24.320]  article in New York magazine is well these guys are causing violence I mean
[1:35:24.320 --> 1:35:30.000]  people are criticizing Cass Sunstein for wanting to infiltrate these grips and
[1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:35.280]  you know diffuse them it calls it a cascade of information we just believe
[1:35:35.280 --> 1:35:41.720]  whatever we want really I just believe whatever I want really the DU is deadly
[1:35:41.720 --> 1:35:45.360]  for our trips that radiations and almost every water supply in the US is
[1:35:45.360 --> 1:35:51.880]  added from the phosphate mines they dig it out of I mean I just showed you
[1:35:51.880 --> 1:35:55.800]  mainstream news admitting it I'm just here highlighting it saying I think this
[1:35:55.800 --> 1:36:00.320]  is a big deal but I'm supposedly crazy
[1:36:05.600 --> 1:36:13.360]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[1:36:13.360 --> 1:36:20.920]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[1:36:20.920 --> 1:36:31.880]  Alex Jones we have to get out of our television head trance the average
[1:36:31.880 --> 1:36:36.200]  American watches more than four and a half hours of TV and two hours of video
[1:36:36.200 --> 1:36:43.120]  games people live in fantasy people are slow moving people just just just get in
[1:36:43.120 --> 1:36:48.880]  an attitude of responding to information like their spectators when
[1:36:48.880 --> 1:36:52.960]  government engages in crimes against us when government lies to us when
[1:36:52.960 --> 1:36:57.200]  corporations lie to us we've got to get aggressive and go after them and at least
[1:36:57.200 --> 1:37:01.720]  speak out against them and not support them instead the government trains us
[1:37:01.720 --> 1:37:06.120]  how to fight with each other what do you think 9,000 malls and Walmart's getting
[1:37:06.120 --> 1:37:09.800]  big telescreens telling everybody to spy on each other and don't trust your
[1:37:09.800 --> 1:37:13.280]  neighbors about it's about teaching us to fight with each other instead of

[1:37:53.920 --> 1:37:57.760]  ground water people just think in the ground in the ground water Japanese
[1:37:57.760 --> 1:38:00.520]  news is reporting that most highly radioactive isotope known to man
[1:38:00.520 --> 1:38:04.720]  plutonium has been discovered in the soil in multiple different locations at
[1:38:04.720 --> 1:38:09.640]  the ailing Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant that means meltdown even so
[1:38:09.640 --> 1:38:12.760]  the Japanese government the plant operators maintain there's no risk to
[1:38:12.760 --> 1:38:18.760]  human health the Kyoto news reports 100,000 times safe levels Washington

[1:38:35.200 --> 1:38:40.600]  talked a lot about this in the first hour but this is such a big deal this is
[1:38:40.600 --> 1:38:45.360]  such a huge deal is why I've been talking about it quite a bit today and
[1:38:45.360 --> 1:38:49.480]  ahead of Larry Pratt I want to continue getting into this news and
[1:38:49.480 --> 1:38:54.000]  information big story out of Politico it's up on the drugs report we're gonna
[1:38:54.000 --> 1:38:58.640]  get it up on infowars.com we're gonna get it up on prisonplanet.com media
[1:38:58.640 --> 1:39:04.040]  matters war against Fox and it says the liberal group media matters has quietly
[1:39:04.040 --> 1:39:07.800]  transformed itself in preparation for what its founder David Brock described
[1:39:07.800 --> 1:39:12.320]  in an interview as an all-out campaign of guerrilla warfare and sabotage aimed at
[1:39:12.320 --> 1:39:17.680]  Fox News channel the group launched a more traditional the group launches a
[1:39:17.680 --> 1:39:22.560]  more traditional media critic never has been has all but abandoned its
[1:39:22.560 --> 1:39:26.360]  monitoring of newspapers other television networks with $10 million of
[1:39:26.360 --> 1:39:29.960]  funding a year and is narrowing its focus to Fox and a handful of
[1:39:29.960 --> 1:39:35.840]  conservative websites and if you go there it's infowars.com prisonplanet.com
[1:39:35.840 --> 1:39:39.400]  Alex Jones they did three articles over the weekend going after us I mean I
[1:39:39.400 --> 1:39:42.880]  mean that George Soros' funding group is coming right at us why do you think
[1:39:42.880 --> 1:39:49.140]  that is Fox is just infowars light on some subjects and so they're getting a
[1:39:49.140 --> 1:39:53.880]  giant assault because they reach in the aggregate more people and a group of
[1:39:53.880 --> 1:39:58.080]  conservative websites which it's a leader's view and we're listed on here
[1:39:58.080 --> 1:40:02.760]  ladies and gentlemen we're listed we're the ones to be under attack we're the
[1:40:02.760 --> 1:40:09.400]  ones already under attack we're the ones set for all this new phase and are we
[1:40:09.400 --> 1:40:14.160]  even aware are the listeners aware am I fully conscious and aware of this are
[1:40:14.160 --> 1:40:20.120]  we so dead inside that we don't even recognize what's happening do we even
[1:40:20.120 --> 1:40:29.840]  see do we even know do we even care do we and the Washington examiner asked the
[1:40:29.840 --> 1:40:36.400]  question they ask is it criminal is media matters breaking the law and its
[1:40:36.400 --> 1:40:42.720]  war on Fox News and it goes on conservative websites they're targeting
[1:40:42.720 --> 1:40:46.960]  which its leaders view George Soros the leader as political organizations in the
[1:40:46.960 --> 1:40:50.320]  nerve center of the conservative movement that's the real conservative
[1:40:50.320 --> 1:40:53.720]  movement anybody who in for world government total enslavement the shift
[1:40:53.720 --> 1:41:01.320]  reflects the centrality of the cable channel to the contemporary conservative
[1:41:01.320 --> 1:41:05.640]  movement as well as its loathing it inspires among liberals these aren't
[1:41:05.640 --> 1:41:11.120]  liberals Thomas Jefferson was a liberal these people aren't liberals liberal
[1:41:11.120 --> 1:41:17.040]  means freedom not tyranny not least among those donors who fund media matters
[1:41:17.040 --> 1:41:21.800]  staff of about 90 who are arrayed in neat rows in a giant war room above
[1:41:21.800 --> 1:41:27.800]  Massachusetts Avenue the strategy that we had towards Fox was basically
[1:41:27.800 --> 1:41:31.360]  strategy of containment said Brock media matters chairman and founder and former
[1:41:31.360 --> 1:41:37.280]  conservative journalist adding to the group's main aim had been to challenge
[1:41:37.280 --> 1:41:42.440]  the factual claims of the channel and to attempt to prevent them from reaching
[1:41:42.440 --> 1:41:48.120]  the mainstream media the new strategy he said is a war on Fox in an interview
[1:41:48.120 --> 1:41:53.160]  with a 2010 planning memo Sherrod Politico Brock listed the fronts on which
[1:41:53.160 --> 1:41:57.720]  media matters which is said it's operating a 10 million plus annual budget
[1:41:57.720 --> 1:42:03.080]  is working to chip away at Fox and its parent company news core they've already
[1:42:03.080 --> 1:42:07.560]  taken 400 sponsors from them I mean that is just unbelievable torturous
[1:42:07.560 --> 1:42:11.560]  interference they include its bread-and-butter distribution of embarrassing
[1:42:11.560 --> 1:42:16.080]  clips and attempts to rebut Fox's points as well as a series of under-the-radar
[1:42:16.080 --> 1:42:20.840]  tactics media matters Brock said is assembling an opposition research
[1:42:20.840 --> 1:42:25.480]  files not only on Fox's top executives but on a series of mid-level officials
[1:42:25.480 --> 1:42:30.160]  you go to their site you know who they're putting out stuff you know claiming
[1:42:30.160 --> 1:42:34.000]  becks can cause an Oklahoma City and that's so am I we've got all these
[1:42:34.000 --> 1:42:37.720]  Democratic operatives putting the same stuff out it has hired an activist who
[1:42:37.720 --> 1:42:43.880]  has helped lead successful campaigns to press advertisers to avoid Glenn Beck the
[1:42:43.880 --> 1:42:48.640]  show is assembling a legal team to help people who have clashed with Fox to file
[1:42:48.640 --> 1:42:53.440]  lawsuits for defamation man this is a unbelievable operation invasion of
[1:42:53.440 --> 1:42:58.840]  privacy and other causes and it has hired two experienced reporters Joe
[1:42:58.840 --> 1:43:04.080]  Strupp and Alexander that chick that's the guy from the Rolling Stone who came
[1:43:04.080 --> 1:43:07.720]  to interview me to dig into Fox's operation to help assemble a book on
[1:43:07.720 --> 1:43:15.560]  the network do out in 2012 for vintage anchor in the interest of full disclosure
[1:43:15.560 --> 1:43:20.160]  media matters last month also issued a report criticizing Fox and friends
[1:43:20.160 --> 1:43:27.160]  co-hosts Stacy Ducey's criticism of this reporters blog Brock and media matters
[1:43:27.160 --> 1:43:31.400]  also plan to run a broad campaign against Fox's parent company news core an
[1:43:31.400 --> 1:43:35.240]  effort which will likely will involve opening a United Kingdom arm in London
[1:43:35.240 --> 1:43:39.800]  to attack the company interest there the group hired an executive from move on
[1:43:39.800 --> 1:43:44.080]  dot org to work on the developing campaigns among news core shareholders and
[1:43:44.080 --> 1:43:48.120]  also in looking for ways to turn regulators in the US UK and elsewhere
[1:43:48.120 --> 1:43:51.640]  against the network that means shutting down free speech fairness doctor and all
[1:43:51.640 --> 1:44:00.040]  the stuff they've announced the group will focus on CEO Rupert and trying to
[1:44:00.040 --> 1:44:04.000]  disrupt his commercial interest whether there be here or looking at what's
[1:44:04.000 --> 1:44:08.720]  going on in London right now Brock said referring to news cores apparently
[1:44:08.720 --> 1:44:16.760]  successful move to take a majority stake in the satellite broadcaster B sky now
[1:44:16.760 --> 1:44:22.520]  here's the deal I've done two hours and 16 minutes 18 seconds of broadcast and I
[1:44:22.520 --> 1:44:27.680]  haven't plugged a sponsor a book a video a t-shirt nothing I'm not funded by
[1:44:27.680 --> 1:44:31.240]  Rupert Murdoch I'm not funded by George Soros if you go to media matters
[1:44:31.240 --> 1:44:34.360]  website fact let's go to media matters website and just type in Alex Jones in
[1:44:34.360 --> 1:44:38.600]  the search function they've got page after page of links to their hit pieces
[1:44:38.600 --> 1:44:45.800]  three of them I saw this weekend a couple during the week savage information
[1:44:45.800 --> 1:44:52.240]  coming after us we need your support we need to grow in the face of these
[1:44:52.240 --> 1:44:56.160]  operations there's no doubt we're in their crosshairs there's no out there
[1:44:56.160 --> 1:45:00.480]  affiliated minions are writing hit pieces on us everywhere there's no doubt
[1:45:00.480 --> 1:45:06.200]  that they're praising people like Cass Sunstein who calls for Co and Telpro who
[1:45:06.200 --> 1:45:11.240]  calls for our arrest these are very authoritarian and very dangerous dangerous
[1:45:11.240 --> 1:45:16.400]  dangerous people they've got a gaggle of minions who think it's all funny and
[1:45:16.400 --> 1:45:20.720]  giggle and act like regular people but they're just complete operas and they
[1:45:20.720 --> 1:45:27.840]  think it's all funny and the fact is I'm opposing the globalist takeover of the
[1:45:27.840 --> 1:45:32.520]  dollar I'm opposing George Soros's new Bretton Woods to whether openly calling
[1:45:32.520 --> 1:45:35.200]  to move away from the dollar we're pointing out this is happening we're
[1:45:35.200 --> 1:45:40.360]  opposing the tyranny and so we're being attacked by Fox News minions you heard
[1:45:40.360 --> 1:45:45.400]  Glenn Beck last week ladies and gentlemen hitting me was pure defamation I'm so
[1:45:45.400 --> 1:45:50.800]  busy I can't even respond to it I'm being hit by the right arm and the left arm
[1:45:50.800 --> 1:45:54.200]  but they're also fighting over the power structure for themselves just like
[1:45:54.200 --> 1:46:00.880]  they people thugs fighting Afghanistan Libya Russia overpower so there is
[1:46:00.880 --> 1:46:05.520]  divisions but you notice the only person being attacked by the full spectrum is
[1:46:05.520 --> 1:46:11.280]  us and we need your financial support no doubt by the books by the videos by the

[1:46:45.520 --> 1:46:51.000]  here and drove to attack us ineffectual now they're talking about savaging us in
[1:46:51.000 --> 1:46:57.600]  other ways we are targeted on media matters big time and we need your support

[1:48:26.520 --> 1:48:45.400]  oh Kurt Nemo is gonna do a story about the fact that Politico says that they're
[1:48:45.400 --> 1:48:51.240]  gonna declare war Politico reporting on media matters who's never been an
[1:48:51.240 --> 1:48:55.200]  independent group they would just act like they were arbitrating reality and
[1:48:55.200 --> 1:48:59.520]  they would tell you what was real and what wasn't oh look Alex Jones is
[1:48:59.520 --> 1:49:02.640]  talking about a plan for global government and then I talked to one of
[1:49:02.640 --> 1:49:05.520]  their top reporters that called me for an interview and I said well George
[1:49:05.520 --> 1:49:10.920]  Soros funds you no he doesn't I mean it's like talking to an army officer over
[1:49:10.920 --> 1:49:15.800]  the phone from another country in a war who's lying to me I mean they just do it
[1:49:15.800 --> 1:49:22.000]  with this is an authoritarian system they're setting up the media matters
[1:49:22.000 --> 1:49:25.240]  people you know the little college students they've got there and their
[1:49:25.240 --> 1:49:27.960]  seats giggling listening to this right now that they admittedly listen to the
[1:49:27.960 --> 1:49:31.640]  show every day and watch it need to realize what you're part of just cuz
[1:49:31.640 --> 1:49:36.640]  you say something's liberal they said that Joe Stalin was liberal saying you're
[1:49:36.640 --> 1:49:42.120]  gonna sabotage and destroy people and go after them I mean it's just so nasty
[1:49:42.120 --> 1:49:46.120]  and I never even really talk about media matters except when you lie about me or
[1:49:46.120 --> 1:49:50.480]  twist things I mean I don't want George Soros to kill my dollar I don't want
[1:49:50.480 --> 1:49:53.840]  George Soros shutting down my cold power plants because he's got interest in
[1:49:53.840 --> 1:49:57.440]  the others I don't want to be your slave you're assaulting me with your new
[1:49:57.440 --> 1:50:08.240]  world order but the point is we're attacked by Fox and by media matters but
[1:50:08.240 --> 1:50:13.400]  now media matters is saying that they're going to guerrilla warfare attack Fox
[1:50:13.400 --> 1:50:17.560]  News and other conservative websites and you go on their hit list and I'm right
[1:50:17.560 --> 1:50:23.480]  up there at the top of Fox News I mean how creepy is that Paul Watson has done
[1:50:23.480 --> 1:50:27.840]  a big report that we won't have time to cover today because our guest is about
[1:50:27.840 --> 1:50:33.000]  to join us Larry Pratt but I beg of you to get it off of info wars calm and
[1:50:33.000 --> 1:50:42.320]  prison planet calm pseudo-intellectual hit piece emblematic of crumbling elitist
[1:50:42.320 --> 1:50:48.880]  media New York magazine smear portrays Alex Jones as a paranoid Fox News want
[1:50:48.880 --> 1:50:54.200]  to be while assuring readers that malevolent global elite doesn't exist
[1:50:54.200 --> 1:51:00.280]  no Fox News is an Alex Jones want to be and I told him that I said I don't want
[1:51:00.280 --> 1:51:04.360]  to work at Fox News he kept saying yes you do yes you do yes you do and then
[1:51:04.360 --> 1:51:08.240]  he basically put in there that I want to be at Fox News and then had one of the
[1:51:08.240 --> 1:51:13.200]  programming directors the vice president say Alex Jones will never be here he
[1:51:13.200 --> 1:51:17.600]  needs to keep looking for black helicopters I would be discredited if
[1:51:17.600 --> 1:51:23.360]  they let me on Fox News even if they let me tell the truth and that's what media
[1:51:23.360 --> 1:51:27.720]  matters is really scared of we've pushed Fox News greedy to have the biggest
[1:51:27.720 --> 1:51:32.040]  market share to tell some of the truth we've exposed them as rhinos we've
[1:51:32.040 --> 1:51:36.920]  exposed them as fake conservatives Ron Paul has done it they tried to beat us
[1:51:36.920 --> 1:51:44.520]  now they're trying to limit the damage by a limited hangout by limit by a
[1:51:44.520 --> 1:51:49.560]  limited joining oh yeah the fellow reserves private did some bad things
[1:51:49.560 --> 1:51:52.400]  but they don't mean it yeah there's some people the one global government but
[1:51:52.400 --> 1:52:01.000]  it's it's it's low-level Democrats like Van Jones oh look at the communist he's
[1:52:01.000 --> 1:52:03.840]  a 9-11 truth or then he's not a 9-11 truth or and then he goes let's have
[1:52:03.840 --> 1:52:07.280]  G Ebert Griffin on next who's a 9-11 truth or but never mention that let's
[1:52:07.280 --> 1:52:11.280]  have the Palatano judge the Palatano fill in today and have a Fox business
[1:52:11.280 --> 1:52:15.640]  show number one rated who doesn't believe the official story let's ignore all
[1:52:15.640 --> 1:52:19.920]  that they know their audience is 9-11 truthers they know real libertarians and
[1:52:19.920 --> 1:52:23.720]  conservatives just want the facts and have looked at 9-11 and know the
[1:52:23.720 --> 1:52:29.040]  official stories a lie so they say don't be against Google spying on you or
[1:52:29.040 --> 1:52:33.120]  you're a liberal he said that word for word as if it's liberal to be against
[1:52:33.120 --> 1:52:38.640]  being spied on no liberals love it just like mainline conservatives oh don't
[1:52:38.640 --> 1:52:44.880]  look at a 9-11 or you're this evil communist only 9-11 truthers are van
[1:52:44.880 --> 1:52:53.080]  Jones all this sophomoric garbage and I can't wait to get I've even tried to
[1:52:53.080 --> 1:52:56.360]  call him yet I can't wait to get this I know he's listening right now I can't
[1:52:56.360 --> 1:53:03.680]  wait to get Joe Hagan on the show and I can't wait to get the writer for Rolling
[1:53:03.680 --> 1:53:09.720]  Stone now an admitted minion of media matters I can't wait to get him on the
[1:53:09.720 --> 1:53:12.120]  show they both said they'll come on I just hadn't tried to get them on you
[1:53:12.120 --> 1:53:15.920]  they said weeks ago they would I can't wait to get both those guys on separately
[1:53:15.920 --> 1:53:20.360]  and just go through this article piece by piece and you know if they'll come on
[1:53:20.360 --> 1:53:23.600]  I'm gonna sit there with all of my points with documents and I'm gonna say
[1:53:23.600 --> 1:53:29.560]  okay you front of a computer pal you ready to read about using radiation to
[1:53:29.560 --> 1:53:34.560]  reduce fertility I'm gonna give it to you ready to hear about George Soros
[1:53:34.560 --> 1:53:38.720]  calling for global government let me play a clip of him saying it how about
[1:53:38.720 --> 1:53:43.960]  you stop pretending none of this exists but the fact that they are attacking me
[1:53:43.960 --> 1:53:49.680]  shows that we're very effective we should thank God for this this is great
[1:53:49.680 --> 1:54:02.840]  nurse today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you by
[1:54:02.840 --> 1:54:09.040]  now you should have somehow realized what you gotta do I don't believe that
[1:54:09.040 --> 1:54:21.440]  anybody feels the way I do about you now back be the word is on the street that
[1:54:21.440 --> 1:54:25.600]  the fire in your heart Larry Pratt has been executive director of Gunners America
[1:54:25.600 --> 1:54:29.680]  for over 30 years GLA is a national membership organization over 300,000
[1:54:29.680 --> 1:54:33.840]  Americans dedicated promoting their second amendment freedom to keep their
[1:54:33.840 --> 1:54:37.760]  arms and to stop victim disarmament he's a graduate of American University with
[1:54:37.760 --> 1:54:41.880]  re in political science Pratt was elected the state legislature of Virginia as a
[1:54:41.880 --> 1:54:45.920]  Republican member in 81 a session Virginia House of Delegates elected the
[1:54:45.920 --> 1:54:50.240]  19th district of Fairfax County that's a v-key county he's also a Reagan
[1:54:50.240 --> 1:54:55.600]  delegate in 1980 gun owners org Larry I want to get in and this has been going
[1:54:55.600 --> 1:54:59.040]  on for a month but we're gonna play a little clip for people that don't know
[1:54:59.040 --> 1:55:04.240]  about this or believe it from even CBS news and there's been a lot of
[1:55:04.240 --> 1:55:08.000]  newspapers and obviously you know about it I want your take on it that they
[1:55:08.000 --> 1:55:12.160]  knowingly and it turns out all over the country not just out of the Southwest
[1:55:12.160 --> 1:55:16.280]  allowed guns to be shipped to Mexico because that was their policy to blame
[1:55:16.280 --> 1:55:20.480]  the violence down there on America we know most of it sold by the military to
[1:55:20.480 --> 1:55:24.400]  the drug cartels it's fully auto grenade launchers hang grenades they
[1:55:24.400 --> 1:55:29.240]  caught a US Navy SEALs selling weapons to them so that they could then blame the
[1:55:29.240 --> 1:55:33.400]  guns on America and use that as a reason to call for more gun control which is
[1:55:33.400 --> 1:55:38.440]  what the president's now done during the Fukushima disaster coming out saying
[1:55:38.440 --> 1:55:42.840]  he wants a new legislation this is incredible and I know there's been
[1:55:42.840 --> 1:55:46.520]  calls now for congressional investigations for impeachment if not of
[1:55:46.520 --> 1:55:52.320]  Obama of the Attorney General but I mean this is is this not a false flag or
[1:55:52.320 --> 1:55:56.680]  staged event to blame the Second Amendment I mean we have ATF officers
[1:55:56.680 --> 1:56:03.120]  admitting this absolutely there were some very honorable men on the
[1:56:03.120 --> 1:56:08.560]  ground in the ATF an agency which I don't think should have the last these
[1:56:08.560 --> 1:56:17.760]  are people that they were being ordered to do was let guns go into Mexico to
[1:56:17.760 --> 1:56:23.160]  approve sales that were questioned by dealers you know some guy comes in with
[1:56:23.160 --> 1:56:30.360]  a heavy Spanish accent got a in one case a sack full of cash he's buying a whole
[1:56:30.360 --> 1:56:35.600]  gob of AK-47 that's high a automatic and they call and say we know the guy
[1:56:35.600 --> 1:56:39.280]  checked out okay on your background check but here's what happens should we
[1:56:39.280 --> 1:56:43.320]  let this fail go go ahead and oh yeah yeah that's fine we're monitoring it
[1:56:43.320 --> 1:56:47.920]  well they weren't monitoring hardly any of those and they couldn't monitor them
[1:56:47.920 --> 1:56:52.840]  beyond the border I'll tell you what the Mexicans don't like kindly having
[1:56:52.840 --> 1:56:57.080]  somebody else's law enforcement in their country and they don't and the few
[1:56:57.080 --> 1:57:01.400]  that are allowed in with special diplomatic permission are the ones that
[1:57:01.400 --> 1:57:07.880]  must have no gun on them they must be disarmed so even if they're advisors
[1:57:07.880 --> 1:57:13.600]  going around with some Mexican police or something no gun so it's it's an
[1:57:13.600 --> 1:57:19.640]  incredible story that the ATF hierarchy want us to believe that somehow by
[1:57:19.640 --> 1:57:24.280]  tracing the guns tracking the guns into Mexico they were going to bust the big
[1:57:24.280 --> 1:57:29.440]  cartel boys the leaders and nobody believes that they certainly the agents
[1:57:29.440 --> 1:57:34.600]  on the ground don't believe it but what else can they say Larry Larry as you
[1:57:34.600 --> 1:57:38.760]  know all over the country including Austin the ATF comes in with illegal
[1:57:38.760 --> 1:57:43.920]  aliens they have a driver's license the private sellers not the gun dealers
[1:57:43.920 --> 1:57:49.240]  sell them a gun then they bust them then they use that to threaten the the
[1:57:49.240 --> 1:57:52.960]  leaseholders where they're having the gun shows to shut them down so they're
[1:57:52.960 --> 1:57:56.720]  doing this at the local level but they're also doing it on the national
[1:57:56.720 --> 1:58:01.200]  level and now they've come out saying we've got to restrict your guns and the
[1:58:01.200 --> 1:58:05.000]  ATF has tried to tell gun dealers don't sell somebody more than one gun even if
[1:58:05.000 --> 1:58:09.040]  they're a citizen without a law they're just ordering them to do this because of
[1:58:09.040 --> 1:58:12.640]  what's happening in Mexico but statistically we've seen the statistics
[1:58:12.640 --> 1:58:17.360]  most the guns in Mexico as I said are being sold by the military to the
[1:58:17.360 --> 1:58:22.920]  cartels that's exactly what happened they've gone missing from the armories
[1:58:22.920 --> 1:58:26.720]  of Mexico and those are the ones that might have a serial number because
[1:58:26.720 --> 1:58:31.720]  originally they would have been sold by the United States or allowed by the
[1:58:31.720 --> 1:58:36.520]  United States to sell to the military full-auto m16 battle weapons machine guns
[1:58:36.520 --> 1:58:41.360]  but a lot of the other guns in Mexico don't even have serial numbers those
[1:58:41.360 --> 1:58:47.200]  came in on with a dope load it to think that somehow the Mexican cartel
[1:58:47.200 --> 1:58:54.680]  needs to go to a US gun show to get a gun is just crazy and you're not going to
[1:58:54.680 --> 1:58:59.360]  find an RPG launcher there anyway there's no you're not going to find grenade at
[1:58:59.360 --> 1:59:05.320]  gun shows anyway so a lot of the stuff that the cartels have been using simply
[1:59:05.320 --> 1:59:10.040]  could not have originated from a store from a gun show inside the United
[1:59:10.040 --> 1:59:14.760]  States and I think that's why this gun runner program was set up was to try to
[1:59:14.760 --> 1:59:21.160]  jack up the numbers maybe some 3,000 guns that would be traceable back to the
[1:59:21.160 --> 1:59:27.480]  United States they had it and think of how callous the the higher arts are in
[1:59:27.480 --> 1:59:33.000]  Washington and knowingly let these guns go in knowing that they were going to
[1:59:33.000 --> 1:59:35.960]  show up at crime scene that's the only way you're going to get these guns
[1:59:35.960 --> 1:59:39.360]  traced back to the United States Mexicans pick them up they pay this one of
[1:59:39.360 --> 1:59:43.600]  yours knowing then that somebody has to get murdered in order to get these
[1:59:43.600 --> 1:59:50.400]  statistics up these people need to be taken to jail absolutely and then they'll
[1:59:50.400 --> 1:59:58.120]  throw the book at somebody who hasn't even really violated a gun law here in
[1:59:58.120 --> 2:00:01.920]  the United States or somebody's at a shooting range as has happened and their
[2:00:01.920 --> 2:00:06.880]  AR-15 malfunctions it's a legally bought semi-auto it malfunctions the good
[2:00:06.880 --> 2:00:11.840]  little Nazi tattletales call the police the ATF comes and throws them in
[2:00:11.840 --> 2:00:16.000]  prison because of an admittedly malfunctioned gun that hadn't been
[2:00:16.000 --> 2:00:20.200]  altered they'll spend millions of dollars if need be prosecuting them
[2:00:20.200 --> 2:00:25.360]  meanwhile they're pumping guns into Mexico for the cartels and they did it
[2:00:25.360 --> 2:00:29.000]  with very much that this guy all of me you're talking about that had that
[2:00:29.000 --> 2:00:34.280]  malfunctioning gun they lied on the stand and we couldn't even get this
[2:00:34.280 --> 2:00:39.160]  Supreme Court to take the case up even though we pointed out in our brief for
[2:00:39.160 --> 2:00:47.000]  Mr. Olufsen that the lower court had made a ruling based entirely 180 degrees
[2:00:47.000 --> 2:00:52.720]  contrary to a ruling the Supreme Court had made at an earlier time and the way
[2:00:52.720 --> 2:00:56.680]  our system currently operates unconstitutionally that ruling was
[2:00:56.680 --> 2:01:00.080]  supposed to have been the law of the land and yet the Supreme Court wasn't
[2:01:00.080 --> 2:01:05.320]  even interested that a lower court basically call them to take a hike it
[2:01:05.320 --> 2:01:10.000]  just makes you want to pull your air up Larry I want to play a short clip for
[2:01:10.000 --> 2:01:13.400]  those that just joined us in case they haven't seen this on the news it
[2:01:13.400 --> 2:01:17.360]  hasn't gotten the attention it needs here's a short CBS clip the whole clips
[2:01:17.360 --> 2:01:22.120]  at CBS news dot com but here's just a short piece of it the intro where they
[2:01:22.120 --> 2:01:27.240]  even admit it themselves this is CBS legendary for their lust to disarm the
[2:01:27.240 --> 2:01:32.200]  American people here it is John Dodson a federal agent says what he was asked to
[2:01:32.200 --> 2:01:36.360]  do was beyond belief you were intentionally letting guns go to
[2:01:36.360 --> 2:01:44.080]  Mexico yes ma'am I mean the agency was an alcohol tobacco and firearms senior
[2:01:44.080 --> 2:01:49.080]  agent assigned to this Phoenix office since 2010 Dodson's job is to stop gun
[2:01:49.080 --> 2:01:54.400]  trafficking across the border instead he says he was ordered to sit by and watch
[2:01:54.400 --> 2:02:00.120]  it happen investigators call the tactic letting guns walk in this case into the
[2:02:00.120 --> 2:02:05.000]  hands of criminals who have used them in Mexico in the US Dodson's bosses say
[2:02:05.000 --> 2:02:10.480]  that never happened now he's risking his job to go public I'm boots on the ground
[2:02:10.480 --> 2:02:13.680]  here in Phoenix and tell me we've been doing it every day since I've been here
[2:02:13.680 --> 2:02:19.960]  here I am tell me I didn't do the things that I did tell me you didn't order me
[2:02:19.960 --> 2:02:23.800]  to do the things that I did tell me it did now now you have a name all right
[2:02:23.800 --> 2:02:28.720]  let's stop there this came out a month ago we've shown the mainline news
[2:02:28.720 --> 2:02:32.760]  articles on screen for prison planet dot TV viewers but anybody can just Google
[2:02:32.760 --> 2:02:38.080]  it they now admit that they did order it and the cover-ups collapse and Obama to
[2:02:38.080 --> 2:02:41.640]  protect himself because the congressional calls for inquiries has said
[2:02:41.640 --> 2:02:46.400]  we'll put that headline back up from Forbes or is that Politico I have Forbes
[2:02:46.400 --> 2:02:52.920]  and Politico Obama claims he didn't know about operation fast and furious so so
[2:02:52.920 --> 2:02:58.720]  no that's the San Antonio Express news there so there you have it he now is
[2:02:58.720 --> 2:03:02.920]  trying to protect his hind in there should be a congressional investigation
[2:03:02.920 --> 2:03:09.640]  to prove you know this goes right to the White House very very likely we know
[2:03:09.640 --> 2:03:14.800]  that Eric Holder the appearing general is involved in the cover-up because he
[2:03:14.800 --> 2:03:20.240]  wrote letters responding to Senator Grassley's inquiries telling them to
[2:03:20.240 --> 2:03:26.560]  take a hike and that means as far as I can tell Holder is in on the cover-up if
[2:03:26.560 --> 2:03:31.520]  not in on it earlier on and if you're in on the cover-up you're gonna be in just
[2:03:31.520 --> 2:03:36.600]  as much trouble as the guys who are doing it to begin with Larry how do we
[2:03:36.600 --> 2:03:41.000]  haunt show this how do we make sure that this false flag again staged event
[2:03:41.000 --> 2:03:44.920]  against the Second Amendment is not continued and repeated because if we
[2:03:44.920 --> 2:03:48.680]  don't bring them to justice they're gonna continue running false flag ops
[2:03:48.680 --> 2:03:54.440]  absolutely what we're doing right now we just put out a mailing to our members
[2:03:54.440 --> 2:03:58.760]  is to urge and you can do the same by going to our website at gunowners.org
[2:03:58.760 --> 2:04:04.560]  and getting a hold of the latest alert better yet sign up for them there it's
[2:04:04.560 --> 2:04:09.600]  a freebie because we're putting the heat on the Congress we want members of the
[2:04:09.600 --> 2:04:15.520]  House to encourage Darrell Issa to actually hold a hearing but we he does
[2:04:15.520 --> 2:04:20.760]  have four investigators on this now which is a big step and we want to make
[2:04:20.760 --> 2:04:25.400]  sure that he's fully committed he's in this all the way so that the hearings
[2:04:25.400 --> 2:04:28.000]  will take place because obviously they're not gonna take place in the
[2:04:28.000 --> 2:04:32.200]  Senate Harry Reid's not gonna allow that chairman of the Senate Judiciary
[2:04:32.200 --> 2:04:36.400]  Committee lay he is not gonna allow that but in the House they can do it and
[2:04:36.400 --> 2:04:41.440]  they ought to expend a lot of resources there's a lot of corruption that
[2:04:41.440 --> 2:04:45.760]  Darrell Issa can use his oversight committee for but this one happens to
[2:04:45.760 --> 2:04:51.600]  involve murder and so this one ought to be at the top of the list and that's
[2:04:51.600 --> 2:04:56.920]  what we're asking our folks to help us get across up on the hill and the false
[2:04:56.920 --> 2:05:01.480]  flags don't stop there two Michigan Democrats indicted in fake tea party
[2:05:01.480 --> 2:05:06.080]  scandal and from the evidence they went and we're gonna run a fake tea party
[2:05:06.080 --> 2:05:10.560]  candidate to basically you know say and do horrible things to discredit the tea
[2:05:10.560 --> 2:05:14.880]  party Democrats have been caught doing this all over the country it's also come
[2:05:14.880 --> 2:05:20.480]  out that they've considered Republicans in Wisconsin staging events against their
[2:05:20.480 --> 2:05:25.800]  enemies you know the fact is these type of frameups across the political
[2:05:25.800 --> 2:05:29.880]  landscape are very very common but I've got to say I see it a lot more often
[2:05:29.880 --> 2:05:36.480]  from the Democrats as of late because they're so incredibly desperate and I
[2:05:36.480 --> 2:05:42.600]  mean this is a big big big deal to have the Attorney General tell the US Senate
[2:05:42.600 --> 2:05:47.040]  take a hike I'm not gonna let you know what's going on we just had Obama
[2:05:47.040 --> 2:05:51.920]  launch a new war in Libya without even consulting Congress more and more we have
[2:05:51.920 --> 2:05:56.800]  him trying to shut down coal power plants without you know Congress said no on
[2:05:56.800 --> 2:06:01.080]  the new Kyoto deal but he's going ahead with it I mean is this not all
[2:06:01.080 --> 2:06:07.440]  impeachable Larry Pratt oh I think it's going to end up at least going to the
[2:06:07.440 --> 2:06:11.640]  Attorney General and impeaching him let me just backtrack a second to something
[2:06:11.640 --> 2:06:16.400]  you mentioned a minute ago the the ferocity of the response of the
[2:06:16.400 --> 2:06:21.920]  Democrats the thuggery that they're employing which we saw so evident in
[2:06:21.920 --> 2:06:28.280]  Wisconsin that there's a real reason for this and it's called money if those
[2:06:28.280 --> 2:06:32.880]  public employee unions become voluntary membership then we'll see in
[2:06:32.880 --> 2:06:38.400]  Wisconsin what happened in Indiana the membership will drop about 90% and the
[2:06:38.400 --> 2:06:45.400]  impact of that is so we'll lose money drop 90% so we'll political contributions
[2:06:45.400 --> 2:06:51.600]  to the hardcore left Democrat drop 90% and that's what it's all about and then
[2:06:51.600 --> 2:06:57.240]  they lose their control and they don't get to take our guns yes that's
[2:06:57.240 --> 2:07:03.040]  exactly it's a gun issue it's a pro-life issue it's a pro taxpayer issue it's a
[2:07:03.040 --> 2:07:08.040]  pro-landowner issue all the freedom issues are found up in the fight against
[2:07:08.040 --> 2:07:13.200]  compulsory unionism and as far as I'm concerned gun owners of America needs to
[2:07:13.200 --> 2:07:16.960]  be shoulder to shoulder with these folks they're in that battle because they're
[2:07:16.960 --> 2:07:22.520]  that's a battle for us Ron Paul has been outspoken on so many great things I
[2:07:22.520 --> 2:07:26.760]  know he said a few things about this false flag to ship guns to Mexico and
[2:07:26.760 --> 2:07:31.280]  then blame it on the American Second Amendment here in the United States but
[2:07:31.280 --> 2:07:37.760]  we need to get Ron Paul we need to get Rand Paul out front we need to drag and
[2:07:37.760 --> 2:07:43.880]  haul the Attorney General to haul Obama before the Congress and say we're your
[2:07:43.880 --> 2:07:48.800]  boss and we know what you did and and and when did the president know you know
[2:07:48.800 --> 2:07:55.920]  what did he know we need to get this rolling right now and we could defeat
[2:07:55.920 --> 2:08:00.640]  this corrupt political dragon now now shifting gears into another area I don't
[2:08:00.640 --> 2:08:04.640]  know Larry if you've seen media matters but if you go to media matters run by
[2:08:04.640 --> 2:08:09.440]  George Soros on record they spent about 20% of their time on yours truly and
[2:08:09.440 --> 2:08:14.320]  Politico reports that they now are going to shift to an all-out campaign of
[2:08:14.320 --> 2:08:18.880]  guerrilla warfare and sabotage to bankrupt Fox and destroy them the
[2:08:18.880 --> 2:08:23.440]  Washington examiner says is this illegal because they're a 501c3 but I
[2:08:23.440 --> 2:08:26.440]  think it's illegal for anybody to say they're going to destroy something and
[2:08:26.440 --> 2:08:30.480]  but they said Fox News and other conservative websites well it turns
[2:08:30.480 --> 2:08:35.920]  out info wars is listed prison planet so other than Fox I'm the biggest person
[2:08:35.920 --> 2:08:39.040]  they're attacking because I'm anti-globalism I don't like Soros as
[2:08:39.040 --> 2:08:42.720]  Bretton Woods to to get rid of the dollar I mean folks we're asking for
[2:08:42.720 --> 2:08:47.680]  people to pray for us because these are very hardcore authoritarian they're
[2:08:47.680 --> 2:08:51.680]  praising Cass Sunsteen's calls to restrict free speech in the news right
[2:08:51.680 --> 2:08:56.560]  now they're attacking yours truly everywhere I mean they are so cornered
[2:08:56.560 --> 2:09:01.000]  and so desperate they think Americans even though the Republicans are rhinos
[2:09:01.000 --> 2:09:05.480]  mainly they realize that we're taking over the Republican Party that there is
[2:09:05.480 --> 2:09:10.280]  a true restoration happening and that makes them deadly dangerous what do you
[2:09:10.280 --> 2:09:15.200]  make of this media matters war against Fox and the fact that they they've gotten
[2:09:15.200 --> 2:09:19.640]  this memo where they say we are going to destroy and we're going to use
[2:09:19.640 --> 2:09:23.720]  government it's in there to shut down free speech I mean these people are
[2:09:23.720 --> 2:09:29.480]  literal Joe Stalin's what else is it I think you read it spot on and one of
[2:09:29.480 --> 2:09:34.120]  the most alarming comment tells you what would happen if the Democrats were to
[2:09:34.120 --> 2:09:40.160]  retake power that in the Congress was a statement by Senator Lautenberg that
[2:09:40.160 --> 2:09:45.680]  these conservatives don't deserve the protections of the Constitution Wow
[2:09:45.680 --> 2:09:50.960]  in your face is that yet these people just want to get ahold of our throats
[2:09:50.960 --> 2:09:56.480]  with their boot and step on it they're all about power they're not about
[2:09:56.480 --> 2:10:02.600]  process at all the the ends justify the means for them and elections are only
[2:10:02.600 --> 2:10:07.400]  important to them when they win but otherwise they just want to drive right
[2:10:07.400 --> 2:10:10.360]  on through the heck they lost the last election they don't care about that
[2:10:10.360 --> 2:10:14.560]  they'll send the folks over and beat the stride out of you until you agree to
[2:10:14.560 --> 2:10:18.160]  say okay well we didn't really win we'll give you what you want even though the
[2:10:18.160 --> 2:10:23.240]  people elected another party to go and take care of business and I also think
[2:10:23.240 --> 2:10:27.640]  that you've made a very important point that the road to the future and the road
[2:10:27.640 --> 2:10:32.160]  to freedom is by taking over the Republican Party and it hasn't been
[2:10:32.160 --> 2:10:37.240]  completed a long way from that but it's begun and I think the Tea Party has it
[2:10:37.240 --> 2:10:41.680]  all right they understand that they're not running third parties they're not
[2:10:41.680 --> 2:10:45.120]  going to divide the vote they're going to go straight into the primaries and
[2:10:45.120 --> 2:10:50.360]  take out the the rhinos and you know all of a sudden Orrin Hatch has returned to
[2:10:50.360 --> 2:10:54.960]  his roots of 30 years ago he's trying to play like he's a conservative again it's
[2:10:54.960 --> 2:11:00.880]  really marvelous to watch well it certainly is we have an article in
[2:11:00.880 --> 2:11:06.040]  infowars.com and prisonplanet.com pseudo-intellectual hit piece emblematic
[2:11:06.040 --> 2:11:11.080]  of crumbling elitist media that's the danger mainline media imploding Fox
[2:11:11.080 --> 2:11:15.480]  News acting like they're anti-new world order getting ratings they understand
[2:11:15.480 --> 2:11:21.840]  the future is liberty is 1776 they see the rise of this broadcast they're
[2:11:21.840 --> 2:11:26.200]  getting scared Larry Prett I want to talk about the type of dirty tricks we
[2:11:26.200 --> 2:11:29.400]  can see out of these folks but I think to mainline liberals out there who are
[2:11:29.400 --> 2:11:34.480]  good people I mean how scary is this that they're calling for restrictions of
[2:11:34.480 --> 2:11:39.080]  the free press in the US and England that they're praising cast Sunstein
[2:11:39.080 --> 2:11:44.280]  stratagem of going after the First Amendment that they're calling for
[2:11:44.280 --> 2:11:49.960]  destroying Fox News I mean it this is very dangerous to the free press in this
[2:11:49.960 --> 2:11:58.200]  country we'll be right back no matter how hard you try you can't stop us now
[2:11:58.200 --> 2:12:10.140]  well we have Larry Pratt the head of gun owners of America joining us websites
[2:12:10.140 --> 2:12:15.680]  gunowners.org our sites are infowars.com and prisonplanet.tv you know it's
[2:12:15.680 --> 2:12:20.040]  creepy to have cast Sunstein put out public documents regulations are at the
[2:12:20.040 --> 2:12:24.160]  White House and say we will arrest people who do not believe in global warming
[2:12:24.160 --> 2:12:29.120]  you actually said that or will at least tax them and we need the government to
[2:12:29.120 --> 2:12:32.200]  be able to take over people's websites we don't agree with I mean these are
[2:12:32.200 --> 2:12:42.920]  tyrants and going back now to Larry Pratt Larry to see media matters at
[2:12:42.920 --> 2:12:46.960]  George Soros doing this do you see that as I see it that it that it is an act of
[2:12:46.960 --> 2:12:52.520]  desperation I agree that's why they were so violent and Madison that's why
[2:12:52.520 --> 2:12:56.760]  they're going to be violent and other government centers because they realized
[2:12:56.760 --> 2:13:00.880]  that this is the they've tried ignoring us and that didn't work we just grew
[2:13:00.880 --> 2:13:05.040]  stronger because we have the alternate media we have your program we have we
[2:13:05.040 --> 2:13:08.480]  have the internet we have all kinds of ways of communicating that we didn't
[2:13:08.480 --> 2:13:14.320]  have even 10 years ago and it's like a cornered animal they are starting to
[2:13:14.320 --> 2:13:18.960]  bear their teeth and and charge because they have no other way to go than right
[2:13:18.960 --> 2:13:26.240]  over as they are that desperate and if we remain determined I think we're we're
[2:13:26.240 --> 2:13:29.520]  going to emerge triumphant because they don't have the majority of the people in
[2:13:29.520 --> 2:13:33.520]  this country this is a right of center country and I think we're going to take
[2:13:33.520 --> 2:13:39.040]  them and I agree they are panicking and I see this as a clear miscalculation by
[2:13:39.040 --> 2:13:44.600]  them brazenly coming out as hardcore authoritarians and censors they are
[2:13:44.600 --> 2:13:50.040]  really showing folks who they really are absolutely they they do better much
[2:13:50.040 --> 2:13:54.320]  better when they lie like Obama and just I'm here for on the little open a
[2:13:54.320 --> 2:13:58.120]  little change and everything will be better again and then people were
[2:13:58.120 --> 2:14:02.120]  encouraged because of those were nice sounding words but these are not nice
[2:14:02.120 --> 2:14:06.440]  sounding actions that people are seeing and it's very alarming to the American
[2:14:06.440 --> 2:14:10.560]  people and I think you know if you and I had had a concern after the last
[2:14:10.560 --> 2:14:15.680]  election that the Tea Party was going to say okay we took care of business we can
[2:14:15.680 --> 2:14:21.640]  go back to Parker no I don't think I see that I think Madison insured that the
[2:14:21.640 --> 2:14:27.040]  country stays stirred up that we realize now that these guys want everything we
[2:14:27.040 --> 2:14:33.040]  have they want to inflate us and if we let down our guard now all the work that
[2:14:33.040 --> 2:14:37.040]  we've done and the some of the success that we've had so far all of that goes
[2:14:37.040 --> 2:14:41.920]  away so I think we're going to remain energized the left talks about there
[2:14:41.920 --> 2:14:46.720]  having been energized because governor Walker has probably won the battle up
[2:14:46.720 --> 2:14:51.840]  there no well maybe so but those are people that get paid for what they're
[2:14:51.840 --> 2:14:56.120]  doing well Larry Pratt you know the system so scared they've let some of
[2:14:56.120 --> 2:14:58.880]  people on Fox News actually talk about the private fellow reserve the new old
[2:14:58.880 --> 2:15:03.120]  order now so the system really is hedging its bets but final question we
[2:15:03.120 --> 2:15:05.920]  know Oklahoma City I've never asked your opinion of that but a lot of
[2:15:05.920 --> 2:15:08.920]  prestigious publications and others have pointed out the prior knowledge the
[2:15:08.920 --> 2:15:13.240]  involvement as a pretext to demonize the state rights true Liberty movement in
[2:15:13.240 --> 2:15:18.760]  1995 I and I've even Beck has talked about memos put out by democratic
[2:15:18.760 --> 2:15:23.400]  strategies about how great a new Oklahoma City would be to be blamed on the
[2:15:23.400 --> 2:15:27.040]  libertarian conservative movement are you concerned about because of they'll
[2:15:27.040 --> 2:15:31.440]  ship guns to Mexico to get our second amendment they might do something else
[2:15:31.440 --> 2:15:36.760]  to really go after the American people I mean Obama kill switches well they're
[2:15:36.760 --> 2:15:41.520]  capable of anything my guess is that Oklahoma City if we keep up the drum
[2:15:41.520 --> 2:15:45.480]  beat is going to keep them on the defensive yeah I've been amazed at this
[2:15:45.480 --> 2:15:53.400]  a reporter Cheryl Ackerson in CVS a very unlikely news source has had story
[2:15:53.400 --> 2:16:00.240]  after story after story on running the gun in the Mexico and eventually other
[2:16:00.240 --> 2:16:05.380]  publications and other networks have it almost looks to me like
[2:16:05.380 --> 2:16:10.160]  wretchingly picked up the story but you are worried about them launching even
[2:16:10.160 --> 2:16:15.160]  bigger false flags if they thought they could get away with it I'm sure they're
[2:16:15.160 --> 2:16:19.400]  quite capable of it because what they've done with Mexico in gun runner shows
[2:16:19.400 --> 2:16:23.800]  they don't care about people's lives they only care about keeping us
[2:16:23.800 --> 2:16:28.000]  distracted from the main order of business so that they can retain or
[2:16:28.000 --> 2:16:32.600]  regain power we got to go to break Larry we got to go to break I want to come
[2:16:32.600 --> 2:16:39.360]  back just for a couple minutes this is GCN the Genesis communications radio
[2:16:39.360 --> 2:16:42.120]  network
[2:16:48.280 --> 2:16:53.080]  okay final segment with Larry Pratt we're gonna come back and retransmission
[2:16:53.080 --> 2:16:56.680]  it all the news we covered earlier but we're live right now Larry we're talking
[2:16:56.680 --> 2:16:59.800]  during the break about the Southern Prairie Law Center other groups that
[2:16:59.800 --> 2:17:05.080]  demonize mainline pro-second amendment groups property rights groups I mean
[2:17:05.080 --> 2:17:09.560]  they're there to act like they're these watchdogs but now media matters and
[2:17:09.560 --> 2:17:14.240]  others have just said forget it we've never been a watchdog we are political
[2:17:14.240 --> 2:17:19.440]  attack dogs and we're gonna destroy free press we disagree with and they play
[2:17:19.440 --> 2:17:23.080]  little games like saying well Fox News and other conservative websites they're
[2:17:23.080 --> 2:17:26.920]  not really news we can destroy them well my free speech is my free speech I've
[2:17:26.920 --> 2:17:30.480]  got a lot of criticisms of Fox News and their support of the Patriot Act and
[2:17:30.480 --> 2:17:33.800]  things that are used against the American people but that said you don't
[2:17:33.800 --> 2:17:38.040]  destroy them you don't try to get all their sponsors in and it says get the
[2:17:38.040 --> 2:17:45.240]  government to take their license I mean we have to defend ourselves because it
[2:17:45.240 --> 2:17:48.480]  says in other conservative sites you go there I'm listed as a conservative site
[2:17:48.480 --> 2:17:52.640]  by them one of their favorite people to attack you are others are we have now
[2:17:52.640 --> 2:17:56.200]  they've and it turns out this war was declared last year this memo just got
[2:17:56.200 --> 2:18:00.920]  out today or yesterday they've declared war on us Larry Pratt what do you think
[2:18:00.920 --> 2:18:06.040]  we should do because they're saying guerrilla warfare and and Cass Sunstein
[2:18:06.040 --> 2:18:11.400]  is their mascot who says actually infiltrate our groups get in and make
[2:18:11.400 --> 2:18:14.360]  tea party people look bad they've caught Democrats all over the country
[2:18:14.360 --> 2:18:19.240]  dressed up as Rand Paul supporters saying racist things caught I mean these
[2:18:19.240 --> 2:18:23.880]  people are is this not racketeering when an organization of people try to
[2:18:23.880 --> 2:18:28.600]  suppress in bully is it not an active really classical terrorism to threaten
[2:18:28.600 --> 2:18:33.600]  or bully to get people to agree to your political aims this is the left doing
[2:18:33.600 --> 2:18:37.880]  what the left does and I think we can expect to see more of the thuggery that
[2:18:37.880 --> 2:18:43.480]  we saw in in Madison they feel that anything they do is justified because
[2:18:43.480 --> 2:18:48.680]  we're evil and it doesn't even bear an argument we're racist because that's
[2:18:48.680 --> 2:18:53.080]  their default accusation when they've lost the argument and frankly I think we
[2:18:53.080 --> 2:18:59.440]  ought to take all these developments as a sign of encouragement that if this is
[2:18:59.440 --> 2:19:04.280]  all they feel they can do now that their control of the Democrat media doesn't
[2:19:04.280 --> 2:19:09.200]  work anymore if their control of the positions of power slipping from their
[2:19:09.200 --> 2:19:15.320]  hand then we should just redouble what we've been doing because it's working
[2:19:15.320 --> 2:19:20.440]  pretty well no that's what they say in the internal memo is that the patriot
[2:19:20.440 --> 2:19:23.680]  movement is slaughtering them intellectually and that they are
[2:19:23.680 --> 2:19:29.760]  desperate man I'm gonna have to read that memo because for them to admit
[2:19:29.760 --> 2:19:34.400]  even privately that we're mowing them down intellectually that is an
[2:19:34.400 --> 2:19:39.960]  interesting point for them I haven't heard that sort of a thing said by them
[2:19:39.960 --> 2:19:44.920]  before I mean you and I knew that because we have to endure their infamy so
[2:19:44.920 --> 2:19:49.840]  much when they talk about us and other conservatives but for them to actually
[2:19:49.840 --> 2:19:55.000]  admit it to themselves no wonder they're desperate well they're very very
[2:19:55.000 --> 2:19:59.400]  dangerous and I would ask libertarians conservatives mainline liberals
[2:19:59.400 --> 2:20:03.800]  remember this is America let's defend I don't support the white supremacist or
[2:20:03.800 --> 2:20:07.520]  the black supremacist and horrible things they say but if they lose their
[2:20:07.520 --> 2:20:12.400]  rights we lose ours and the same thing to Democrats out there you know I've
[2:20:12.400 --> 2:20:17.840]  always defended free speech across the board this shocks even me I mean this is
[2:20:17.840 --> 2:20:22.840]  a group of people saying we're gonna do it Cass Sunstein says you know jihad
[2:20:22.840 --> 2:20:26.440]  against the first amendment and let me tell you something there's only one
[2:20:26.440 --> 2:20:29.200]  thing I love more than the second amendment and our bill of rights and
[2:20:29.200 --> 2:20:33.880]  that's the first and I'm getting chills right now Larry I can't believe they're
[2:20:33.880 --> 2:20:38.440]  showing us what a nest of miscreant monsters they are I mean these people
[2:20:38.440 --> 2:20:43.840]  would love to be Joe Stalin if they'd go this far public can you imagine who
[2:20:43.840 --> 2:20:47.520]  they are there and this is their big mistake
[2:20:47.520 --> 2:20:52.600]  Obama had it right you lie your way through if there he is looking you know
[2:20:52.600 --> 2:20:56.480]  people say he's dithering he's not dithering he's looking to find which
[2:20:56.480 --> 2:21:00.280]  side the Muslim Brotherhood is on and then he'll get involved he's not
[2:21:00.280 --> 2:21:04.640]  dithering about the economy he's tearing it apart he looks like he's out
[2:21:04.640 --> 2:21:09.680]  playing golf and getting nothing done don't believe it for a second this guy
[2:21:09.680 --> 2:21:16.040]  is all business 24-7 and his business is the destruction of America well we're
[2:21:16.040 --> 2:21:20.000]  gonna defend the Republic together no compromise gun owners of America gun
[2:21:20.000 --> 2:21:25.960]  owners.org Larry I salute you together we will restore the Republic talk to you
