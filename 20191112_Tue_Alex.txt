[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[00:10.000 --> 00:18.000]  It's Tuesday, November 9th, 2019.
[00:18.000 --> 00:25.000]  We only have 256 days left to this historic election.
[00:25.000 --> 00:30.000]  And it's that time of year when we see a lot of rulings come down from the Supreme Court.
[00:30.000 --> 00:33.000]  One came down just about an hour and a half ago.
[00:33.000 --> 00:36.000]  I have the ruling right here.
[00:36.000 --> 00:44.000]  And our so-called conservative court just dealt a mortal wound to the Second Amendment.
[00:44.000 --> 00:51.000]  A mortal wound is one that kills it if you don't get medical attention right away.
[00:51.000 --> 00:55.000]  So you get shot in the heart. A lot of times you die right away. Sometimes you can survive.
[00:55.000 --> 00:59.000]  But this isn't just a mortal wound to the Second Amendment.
[00:59.000 --> 01:04.000]  It is a mortal wound to common sense, a mortal wound to commerce,
[01:04.000 --> 01:08.000]  where it'll be impossible to do business in America because they've ruled,
[01:08.000 --> 01:12.000]  and I've talked to two lawyers already this morning that are experts,
[01:12.000 --> 01:20.000]  that any company that someone uses a product in the commission of a crime is now liable.
[01:20.000 --> 01:25.000]  Somebody runs over you with a car improperly. Ford or Chevy's liable.
[01:25.000 --> 01:30.000]  Somebody stabs you with a butcher knife. Ginsu Knives is liable.
[01:30.000 --> 01:34.000]  This is unbelievable. And listen to me very carefully, folks.
[01:34.000 --> 01:45.000]  It's the same Democrat party law firm with Senator Blumenthal that is suing us openly saying
[01:45.000 --> 01:50.000]  they want to overturn the First Amendment and saying I don't have right to speech and that no conservatives do,
[01:50.000 --> 01:53.000]  and that they believe the NRA should not have speech as well.
[01:53.000 --> 01:59.000]  So this is a dangerous group of authoritarians, and they believe they can conquer this country.
[01:59.000 --> 02:05.000]  And you know they've been blackmailing members of the Supreme Court when they made up all that stuff about cabin on the rest of them.
[02:05.000 --> 02:12.000]  That's a message. We'll destroy you. We'll bring women out on you even while you're sitting and try to remove you off the bench.
[02:12.000 --> 02:15.000]  They're terrorizing everyone. The deep state is.
[02:15.000 --> 02:19.000]  And if people think bending over to it is going to get us ahead, they've got nothing coming.
[02:19.000 --> 02:26.000]  We'll tell you who voted how, but the conservative court just hit the Second Amendment with two massive, devastating broadsides.
[02:26.000 --> 02:29.000]  There's never been a ruling like this against the Second Amendment.
[02:29.000 --> 02:33.000]  It is unbelievable, and it's like being punched in the stomach.
[02:33.000 --> 02:38.000]  Everybody that thinks Trump and the Liberty Movement's invincible is smoking globalist dope.
[02:38.000 --> 02:45.000]  This country is in a fight for its life, and people better decide which side we're on.
[02:45.000 --> 02:47.000]  We'll be right back.
[02:47.000 --> 02:53.000]  If you think gun control or something like that is going to change the terrorist point of view, I think you're out of your mind.
[02:53.000 --> 02:56.000]  You may think you've got me worried about what you're going to do.
[02:56.000 --> 03:01.000]  Dude, you're about to find out what I'm going to do, and that's going to worry you a lot more.
[03:01.000 --> 03:06.000]  You don't step aside. We'll tear you apart.
[03:06.000 --> 03:08.000]  You die first, get it?
[03:08.000 --> 03:13.000]  Your friends might get me in a rush, but not before I make your head into a canoe. You understand me?
[03:13.000 --> 03:15.000]  He's bluffing. Let's rush him.
[03:15.000 --> 03:17.000]  No. He ain't bluffing.
[03:17.000 --> 03:19.000]  And how stupid do you look?
[03:19.000 --> 03:24.000]  Yeah, I don't understand the concepts of the conversation of the gun culture.
[03:24.000 --> 03:28.000]  We've lived with guns since, what, the 7th century or something. I don't know.
[03:28.000 --> 03:30.000]  We all know it right now. Guns.
[03:30.000 --> 03:36.000]  Toe is a metaphor that just the franchise white guys need. It makes them feel good because they're being proud.
[03:36.000 --> 03:38.000]  You can say what you want. I don't agree with that.
[03:38.000 --> 03:42.000]  There's a big difference between fantasy land and reality. Fantasy land is what we do.
[03:42.000 --> 03:46.000]  Doing a movie. Doing a television show. That's fantasy land, and that's where that stuff belongs.
[03:46.000 --> 03:54.000]  In reality, when we're dealing with things like terrorism, we're all going to have different opinions on how to deal with it.
[03:54.000 --> 04:00.000]  It happens to be that I think there's a very strong reason Founding Fathers had for the 2nd Amendment,
[04:00.000 --> 04:07.000]  and that is that no government ever hasn't had to fight its own people, and its own people hasn't had to fight its own government.
[04:07.000 --> 04:09.000]  So what are you going to do? Outlaw everything?
[04:09.000 --> 04:10.000]  That ain't the answer.
[04:10.000 --> 04:13.000]  Just put some controls.
[04:13.000 --> 04:17.000]  What? So the people who want to defend themselves?
[04:17.000 --> 04:18.000]  Can't?
[04:18.000 --> 04:21.000]  No, not that you can't. Just so the idiots can't get hold of them.
[04:21.000 --> 04:27.000]  Do you really believe they're not going to? Are you serious about that? Are you serious? What good will that?
[04:27.000 --> 04:31.000]  Oh my God. Oh, shit. We had our civil war.
[04:31.000 --> 04:40.000]  If that 2nd Amendment hadn't been there, those people would not have had the opportunity to do what they considered was defending their life, their way, their way of living.
[04:40.000 --> 04:47.000]  So I agree with that. I think that's an important part of our existence, and it's basically that simple.
[04:47.000 --> 04:59.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Tuesday, November 12, 2019, 356 days out from the election.
[04:59.000 --> 05:08.000]  InfoWarsLife has done it again with undoubtedly our biggest breakthrough yet. Super silver whitening toothpaste.
[05:08.000 --> 05:14.000]  This is proprietary. This is with the top lab in the country, and it is incredibly high quality.
[05:14.000 --> 05:21.000]  This is the best toothpaste you're going to find. It's called whitening toothpaste, but really it knocks out the bacteria.
[05:21.000 --> 05:26.000]  It recalcifies the teeth. It does so many things on so many fronts.
[05:26.000 --> 05:33.000]  These beautiful tubes of super silver toothpaste are available at an introductory price of 25% off out of the gates.
[05:33.000 --> 05:37.000]  It's as low as we can go, and they're going to sell out very, very quickly.
[05:37.000 --> 05:41.000]  Super silver whitening toothpaste is going to be a hit.
[05:41.000 --> 05:48.000]  I'm very, very proud of it. I want to thank my father, a retired dentist, for spearheading this the last two years and developing it.
[05:48.000 --> 05:54.000]  It's 25% off out of the gates. That's as low as we can go, because it's very, very expensive to produce.
[05:54.000 --> 06:16.000]  Get yours today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[06:16.000 --> 06:24.000]  It's Tuesday, November 12, 2019.
[06:24.000 --> 06:37.000]  We're only 356 days out from the 2020 election, and treasury and globalist sabotage against our republic is afoot.
[06:37.000 --> 06:39.000]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[06:39.000 --> 06:43.000]  I didn't have open phones throughout the broadcast today, including in the first hour.
[06:43.000 --> 06:47.000]  I know you're going to want to respond to our big story.
[06:47.000 --> 06:55.000]  I was working out this morning, already researched the news for a couple of hours.
[06:55.000 --> 06:58.000]  I had breakfast for my children without them at school.
[06:58.000 --> 07:06.000]  I was working out here at the office, a little gym in the warehouse,
[07:06.000 --> 07:15.000]  and being, being, being, messages come in from my lawyer, Norm Pattis, in Connecticut.
[07:15.000 --> 07:18.000]  He says Supreme Court rules against the Second Amendment.
[07:18.000 --> 07:20.000]  He says, quite frankly, I'm surprised.
[07:20.000 --> 07:26.000]  Now, he's a liberal, not a leftist.
[07:26.000 --> 07:34.000]  And he had thought, like most of us, if the Supreme Court wasn't being blackmailed, which it obviously is, being threatened.
[07:34.000 --> 07:36.000]  That's what the Kavanaugh situation was all about.
[07:36.000 --> 07:41.000]  They're threatening to do that to sitting members right now,
[07:41.000 --> 07:48.000]  that they would have to throw out the lawsuit that's been going for five years.
[07:48.000 --> 07:59.000]  It's already bankrupted Remington firearms of Connecticut, the oldest firearms manufacturer in the United States.
[07:59.000 --> 08:08.000]  Congress passed a law, Protection of Lawful Commerce Arms Act, in 2005,
[08:08.000 --> 08:17.000]  because of thousands of lawsuits filed against gun manufacturers, blaming them for what criminals had done with their guns,
[08:17.000 --> 08:20.000]  or for people misusing them.
[08:20.000 --> 08:23.000]  Well, obviously, if you could sue a car manufacturer for somebody using it,
[08:23.000 --> 08:30.000]  or a knife manufacturer, or a baseball bat manufacturer, or a screwdriver manufacturer, or a nail gun manufacturer,
[08:30.000 --> 08:39.000]  or a hammer manufacturer, or a crowbar manufacturer, or a kitchen sink maker, you can kill someone in the kitchen sink.
[08:39.000 --> 08:44.000]  Then you couldn't have any commerce in this country, and the lawyers would sue every industry out of existence,
[08:44.000 --> 08:52.000]  which they've already basically done, and make it impossible to do business in this country.
[08:52.000 --> 08:57.000]  But we've noticed with this Connecticut law firm that is run by the Democrats,
[08:57.000 --> 09:00.000]  that's one of the most powerful on the East Coast,
[09:00.000 --> 09:10.000]  that they're given the cases that are then set up throughout the food chain and the courts to end basic rights,
[09:10.000 --> 09:12.000]  like the First and Second Amendment.
[09:12.000 --> 09:22.000]  Now, this very law firm, run by Senator Blumenthal and others, has said, we want Alex Jones silenced.
[09:22.000 --> 09:28.000]  You mean to play Blumenthal just a few months ago saying, Jones's conduct is not speech.
[09:28.000 --> 09:35.000]  He is not allowed to speak. We want him shut up. Hell, the same groups want me arrested. They've called for that.
[09:35.000 --> 09:43.000]  So these are very dangerous authoritarians who want your First and your Second Amendment, because when those dominoes fall,
[09:43.000 --> 09:47.000]  all the others fall, and they know exactly what they're doing.
[09:47.000 --> 09:56.000]  And old Remington, and their 3,000 employees are gone.
[09:56.000 --> 10:01.000]  You can still find a few of the firearms. They've got some sub-licensing grips, putting on a few things,
[10:01.000 --> 10:10.000]  the folks that make the Remington 700 for the U.S. military, gone.
[10:10.000 --> 10:12.000]  Why'd they pick Remington?
[10:12.000 --> 10:21.000]  Well, they say that Adam Lanza, who got the gun reportedly illegally from his mother that bought it,
[10:21.000 --> 10:31.000]  another Prozac head, was able to do all this because of advertising saying that you, if you're outnumbered and being attacked,
[10:31.000 --> 10:36.000]  you'll be able to defend yourself. That's what a semi-auto is for, for home defense.
[10:36.000 --> 10:46.000]  And so because he illegally got a gun from his mother that bought it, it's all of our faults as gun owners, and it's the manufacturer's fault.
[10:46.000 --> 10:56.000]  And the same law firm says that I need to be taken off the air because I falsely make claims about things
[10:56.000 --> 11:01.000]  so that I make money and that I made my, quote, fortune off Sandy Hook.
[11:01.000 --> 11:07.000]  You all know we barely ever talked about it, and we were actually able to go back and look at the times when we talked about it.
[11:07.000 --> 11:13.000]  Lister ship went down. People don't like hearing about things like that. We're sick of it.
[11:13.000 --> 11:17.000]  But we cover the Internet having questions about it. That's people's right to do.
[11:17.000 --> 11:24.000]  And they don't want you asking questions about Jesse Smollett or the Covington kids or babies and incubators that never existed
[11:24.000 --> 11:28.000]  against the Iraq war or so many other hoaxes.
[11:28.000 --> 11:32.000]  They want us to believe that there wasn't a stand down at Benghazi when there was.
[11:32.000 --> 11:41.000]  They want us to sit down and take the received knowledge from all the lawyers like Hillary Clinton and Senator Blumenthal
[11:41.000 --> 11:47.000]  and just let Michael Moore tell us how to live. Well, he's got armed bodyguards.
[11:47.000 --> 11:56.000]  So we have the protection of lawful commerce in Arms Act Wikipedia as the Supreme Court ruling from today.
[11:56.000 --> 11:59.000]  It also has the law from 2005.
[11:59.000 --> 12:07.000]  And this is a serious blow against the Second Amendment because
[12:07.000 --> 12:14.000]  this allows lawsuits against gun manufacturers in countervention of the legislative law.
[12:14.000 --> 12:25.000]  Now, the judiciary is supposed to rule of laws or constitutional or not.
[12:25.000 --> 12:30.000]  And clearly this is constitutional. Anybody on this face can see that.
[12:30.000 --> 12:33.000]  You can't even have commerce in this country if that's the case.
[12:33.000 --> 12:43.000]  I think all of the gas cans for the last 20 years don't work and are plastic and leak and you have to screw on weird parts
[12:43.000 --> 12:49.000]  and have safety nozzles that then spill gas all over your lawn mower or all over your car and leak in your vehicle.
[12:49.000 --> 12:55.000]  Some of the old nice metal cans that work so well and had the nice little telescoping metal nozzles and they just were amazing.
[12:55.000 --> 13:00.000]  Remember those? You're older than 20 years old. You remember them.
[13:00.000 --> 13:04.000]  Well, the lawyers decided to say that those weren't safe. They sued them out of existence.
[13:04.000 --> 13:11.000]  And then the lawyers put together companies and got government OSHA approved systems that they all made money off of.
[13:11.000 --> 13:18.000]  Only one company licensing the gas tanks that don't work.
[13:18.000 --> 13:26.000]  Let's see. The lawyers said we won't sue because we own literally a consortium of them, the company that got the approved gas tank.
[13:26.000 --> 13:32.000]  It's like the approved light bulb. It's dangerous, costs 10 times as much, has mercury in it, gives you headaches.
[13:32.000 --> 13:41.000]  But that's what the lawyers got approved. It's all about what they get approved and what they control.
[13:41.000 --> 13:49.000]  So the Supreme Court has ruled that they can sue any gun manufacturer they want anytime.
[13:49.000 --> 13:54.000]  And that if anybody misuses anything, that you are liable.
[13:54.000 --> 14:00.000]  It's like saying if you sell somebody a hamburger and they put cyanide in and feed it to their wife, you're guilty.
[14:00.000 --> 14:06.000]  And that's where this is all going because the lawyers want to take over more of the economy, more of the country.
[14:06.000 --> 14:11.000]  They want to carve up the nation and have their little corporate boards that decide our policy.
[14:11.000 --> 14:19.000]  And Trump comes along and others come along and say, no, we're not going to let you run everything completely and sell us out to China and others that would never put up with any of this.
[14:19.000 --> 14:25.000]  And so they're like, oh, really, we're going to remove you because thank God for the deep state.
[14:25.000 --> 14:29.000]  And so that's who they are. And that's what they're doing. And this is the annihilation of this country.
[14:29.000 --> 14:45.000]  And don't forget the very same law firm coordinating the fake lawsuits against us in Texas as well in the jurisdictions says we want to silence his speech and others.
[14:45.000 --> 14:50.000]  And once they've set the precedent, it's everybody else's as you've seen the deplatforming.
[14:50.000 --> 14:56.000]  Now it's Republican candidates. It's from members of Congress are being deplatformed. Now it's the NRA is being deplatformed.
[14:56.000 --> 15:00.000]  Now Trump campaigns are being deplatformed when he goes to give speeches, that's being blocked.
[15:00.000 --> 15:03.000]  They won't let you say the name of the fake whistleblower.
[15:03.000 --> 15:09.000]  He's a Democrat Party CIA operative on record, Eric Saramala.
[15:09.000 --> 15:15.000]  It's an authoritarian revolution against us and if people don't recognize it, it's game over.
[15:15.000 --> 15:22.000]  But we're here on air. And because of you spreading the word and overriding the censorship by word of mouth via text message, you name it.
[15:22.000 --> 15:27.000]  We are in some ways even getting stronger thanks to you.
[15:27.000 --> 15:31.000]  So keep spreading the word and keep telling people that we're not going to back down.
[15:31.000 --> 15:36.000]  This assault on our basic freedoms, on our speech, on our right self defense will not stand.
[15:36.000 --> 15:39.000]  And one way or another, America is going to prevail against this.
[15:39.000 --> 15:46.000]  But we need to realize how dark the days are and not go to sleep because Trump's in there and because Trump's acting confident.
[15:46.000 --> 15:55.000]  It's his job that confident take action. It's our job to really look at the facts and announce just how serious things are so we can take action.
[15:55.000 --> 16:07.000]  So we're not going to give up.
[16:25.000 --> 16:36.000]  We're going to take a lot of our inventory to a temporary location and rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the flood waters backstory.
[16:36.000 --> 16:44.000]  So here's what you should do right now. Check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com. That's myownpowergrid.com.

[16:57.000 --> 17:06.000]  Heart disease is on the rise. Clawed arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[17:06.000 --> 17:14.000]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[17:14.000 --> 17:20.000]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[17:20.000 --> 17:24.000]  My blood pressure has normalized. My diabetes has totally improved.
[17:24.000 --> 17:31.000]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel. I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[17:31.000 --> 17:39.000]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[17:58.000 --> 18:09.000]  I've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers from InfoWars. Your support and your help in rebooting Americana is a challenge to the globalist system of corporate tyranny.
[18:09.000 --> 18:20.000]  It has really caught hold, not just here in the U.S. but worldwide and President Trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting Americana and basic liberty is amazing as well.
[18:20.000 --> 18:30.000]  He's still lacking on the big tech censorship, taking action against that in some other areas, but tried to end the wars, boosting our economy, speaking out against communist China.
[18:30.000 --> 18:44.000]  Trump's been doing an amazing job, but now more than ever, we really have to realize that we're being targeted because we are effective and the globalists are beginning to lose their war against humanity in a big way.
[18:44.000 --> 18:52.000]  So we're going to see some major fireworks out of them, but it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us.
[18:52.000 --> 18:59.000]  That's an attempt to demoralize us. We've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy.
[18:59.000 --> 19:14.000]  Serving with InfoWars is a great honor, but I still need my morning coffee. And luckily, our break room at the InfoWars headquarters is stocked full of high quality InfoWars store Patriot Blend coffee.

[20:01.000 --> 20:24.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:24.000 --> 20:36.000]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[20:36.000 --> 20:55.000]  Well, it's fun to see President Trump on the White House lawn with a helicopter going on behind him to hear him say that we're kicking the deep state's ass. And compared to where we were five years ago, yes, globalism is in deep trouble,
[20:55.000 --> 21:11.000]  authoritarian nature is being exposed. But their counter-offensive is massive. And if people don't realize that the fight for liberty is eternal, and that the cost of freedom is eternal vigilance,
[21:11.000 --> 21:29.000]  and that these volleys are going to go back and forth, and that if we don't get maximum effort, the Chicoms and the EU globalists really want a civil war slash slow collapse in the United States.
[21:29.000 --> 21:43.000]  They've decided that they're not going to fully conquer the spirit of America, the Midwest, the South areas of the Southwest for 50 years at current rates.
[21:43.000 --> 21:49.000]  And they know that resistance is mounting. And so they just want to collapse it. That's why they let the Chicoms ship in.
[21:49.000 --> 22:03.000]  Thousands of tons of fentanyl every day, enough to kill millions of a pop. It's why they demoralize the population. It's why they're doing all of this is all out war against this country.
[22:03.000 --> 22:16.000]  Spiritual, economic, cultural, geographic, geopolitical war. And yes, it's the best of times. It's the worst of times.
[22:16.000 --> 22:24.000]  That's where we are. But I like to look at the underlying situation.
[22:24.000 --> 22:43.000]  When they allow eight different women to say that Kavanaugh raped them or sexually assaulted them, and then they've had five of the women say that they were ordered to do it or they were threatened by the Democrats who did background checks on them
[22:43.000 --> 22:51.000]  to release dirt on them or that it was just totally fake because they hated him. And those women have been indicted.
[22:51.000 --> 22:59.000]  We should follow up and see where those what two women have been indicted. Last time I checked.
[22:59.000 --> 23:08.000]  But that all just gets moved aside. The next thing happens when you let people do things like that.
[23:08.000 --> 23:16.000]  Those judges, a lot of them have got dirt on them. It's well known with Obamacare that one of them was being blackmailed.
[23:16.000 --> 23:26.000]  And so when we just let the globalist bully everybody and blackmail everybody and death threat everybody and they go after your wives, they go after your husbands.
[23:26.000 --> 23:36.000]  They do dirty tricks that are just unbelievable that I'm not going to even get into on the air, but it's intelligence agency type activity.
[23:36.000 --> 23:46.000]  It's fellow travelers engaging in these type of actions. And so I've been trying to find the ruling.
[23:46.000 --> 23:51.000]  And what I found is PBS and others that were in the room.
[23:51.000 --> 24:10.000]  That Thomas Alito and Gorsuch all criticized the ruling and said that it was terrible and that we're abandoning the Second Amendment and commerce and opening up the country to collapse under millions of lawsuits,
[24:10.000 --> 24:16.000]  which is exactly what I just told you before I read that. That's what it does.
[24:16.000 --> 24:25.000]  I don't just sit up here and say this and you don't need me to tell you that they're going to sue all the gun manufacturers.
[24:25.000 --> 24:31.000]  And that they've got little leftist juries and jurisdictions where they're going to bankrupt every damn one of them.
[24:31.000 --> 24:38.000]  By the way, I know a lot of the NRA folks, a lot of the gun owners of America folks, you know almost none of the gun manufacturers give any money to pro gun groups.
[24:38.000 --> 24:51.000]  Almost none of the gun manufacturers fund any counter information at the globalist. They just sit there and take it and are scared of any gutsy marketing.
[24:51.000 --> 24:57.000]  The NRA just acts its whole media division that was doing really good work.
[24:57.000 --> 25:02.000]  And that's because the globalists did infiltration and almost brought the whole thing down.
[25:02.000 --> 25:10.000]  They put intelligence operatives into the NRA and they put people posing as Russians into it and the NRA didn't take any of the bait,
[25:10.000 --> 25:15.000]  but it rattled a lot of the executives so they ran for the high ground.
[25:15.000 --> 25:20.000]  That's what most people do now. The average American thinks when there's a confrontation or a threat,
[25:20.000 --> 25:26.000]  you head for the grass, the tall grass and that lived to play golf another day.
[25:26.000 --> 25:35.000]  Well, you're not Americans. It wasn't that type of attitude and spirit that built this country that was the marvel of the world where if you started fights with people,
[25:35.000 --> 25:41.000]  they would call you on it whether they lived or died.
[25:41.000 --> 25:45.000]  But let me tell you, there's a real shortage of men in this country.
[25:45.000 --> 25:56.000]  And I'm not talking about working in the steel mills that are still left or in the fields or auto mechanics or as police officers or even school teachers or football coaches or the military.
[25:56.000 --> 26:09.000]  I'm talking about the executives. The executive class is a bunch of limp-wristed lawyers and yes men that all kiss each other's ass and get in committees
[26:09.000 --> 26:17.000]  and make sure nobody's going to be offended by anything and then Hollywood sets the standard that if you don't bow down to us, you don't follow what we want, we'll come after you.
[26:17.000 --> 26:29.000]  And so they become the benchmark of okay, let's let convicted pedophiles come to the school and have five-year-olds sit in their lap because that's what we'll put up with.
[26:29.000 --> 26:45.000]  Because the country created so much prosperity that the average person can hide out in their house and play golf and polish their Porsche all day and go on their hunting trips and sit there just hoping it doesn't come too soon
[26:45.000 --> 26:50.000]  and resigning their children to slavery.
[26:50.000 --> 26:59.000]  But our audience of activist listeners who are in the arena who I salute, you don't want to be slaves. You don't want to commit to this evil.
[26:59.000 --> 27:03.000]  You want to commit to freedom and I get it. That's why we're here.
[27:03.000 --> 27:14.000]  And our spirit of liberty is infectious as Brian Stelter and Tom Brokaw and Dan Rather have all called me a disease and that we're spreading and that we have energy
[27:14.000 --> 27:23.000]  and we're aggressive and we're not scared and we're on fire. This isn't a fight where it's sad and we're down in the ditch.
[27:23.000 --> 27:28.000]  We're on fire with liberty. We're strong.
[27:28.000 --> 27:40.000]  This is what we were made for. We can see through the enemy's operations because when you stop lined yourself and decide to fight, decide to get politically active, that's what you're made to do.
[27:40.000 --> 27:51.000]  And suddenly it's not hard. In fact, it's something you want to do like breathing. It's just like exercise. You stop doing it. It's horrible at first.
[27:51.000 --> 27:56.000]  You do it for a few months. Suddenly you're addicted. You love it. You're losing weight. You're getting in shape and it's amazing.
[27:56.000 --> 28:02.000]  Well, it's the same thing with freedom. We've been sitting there on the couch. We weigh 500 pounds politically and spiritually.
[28:02.000 --> 28:16.000]  And we think if we get up and go mow the yard, it's going to break our back. No, we're going to die as a society and a culture and rotten that chair if we don't get up off our ass collectively now and take back control of our country from evil.
[28:16.000 --> 28:28.000]  And you say, well, why does evil keep taking over? Because evil has a desire for power and when good people aren't in charge and aren't standing up for themselves and aren't territorial, evil comes in.
[28:28.000 --> 28:40.000]  It fills that vacuum. But they are blackmailing. The Supreme Court, they're scared Trump may get a few decent ones in there.
[28:40.000 --> 28:53.000]  And I'm going to get exactly how these votes went down. But the Republican Court, that two more Republicans than Democrats just gang rate the Second Amendment and due process and commerce and everything.
[28:53.000 --> 28:58.000]  You think this country can't compete now? Wait till this. This is a huge torpedo.

[30:40.000 --> 30:50.000]  And when I take these products, the results are nothing less than miraculous. Well, one product that's amazing that I use, I don't talk enough about, is gut fusion.

[31:00.000 --> 31:10.000]  A few days ago, my 11-year-old daughter came to me and she had her digital textbook. She said, Dad, they're teaching us about the periodic table. And I clicked on iodine.
[31:10.000 --> 31:18.000]  And it says that 2 billion people have low IQs or mentally retarded on the planet Earth because they didn't get enough iodine. That's what you say all the time.
[31:18.000 --> 31:26.000]  But I've heard people say you're crazy and it's not true. But Dad, it's right here on the periodic table when I click it, saying exactly what you said.
[31:26.000 --> 31:36.000]  And I said, I know, honey, that's why I have you take the high-quality, nutraceutical grade. Iodine is because it's why you're so vibrant. It's why you're so alive.
[31:36.000 --> 31:46.000]  It's one of the reasons that you're so much healthier and smarter than most other kids your age. And it just really blew her away to read it there for herself.
[31:46.000 --> 31:56.000]  So the 2 billion people, ladies and gentlemen, 2 billion are mentally retarded on the face of the Earth right now because of iodine deficiency. Research it and find out for yourself now.

[32:26.000 --> 32:35.000]  These beautiful tubes of super silver toothpaste are available at an introductory price of 25% off out of the gates. It's as low as we can go.
[32:35.000 --> 32:43.000]  And they're going to sell out very, very quickly. Super silver whitening toothpaste is going to be a hit. I'm very, very proud of it.
[32:43.000 --> 32:50.000]  I want to thank my father, a retired dentist for spearheading this the last two years and developing it. It's 25% off out of the gates.
[32:50.000 --> 33:00.000]  That's as low as we can go because it's very, very expensive to produce. Get yours today at infowarslife.com.
[33:00.000 --> 33:09.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:09.000 --> 33:30.000]  We've got it. Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[33:30.000 --> 33:47.000]  It's 356 days out from the 2020 election countdown. It's Tuesday, November 12th, 2019. I intend to have open phones for the entire second, third hour.
[33:47.000 --> 34:01.000]  I may even get to some calls next segment. Your take on this unprecedented attack on the Second Amendment and on the right of commerce in this country saying people are guilty for how other third parties misuse their products.
[34:01.000 --> 34:10.000]  Adam Lanza stole the firearm he used reportedly from his mother. Killed her with it. I mean, this is just insane.
[34:10.000 --> 34:21.000]  The same law firm suing me. Same idea. They want to claim that conservative speech is not speech, that nationalist speech is not speech. In fact, people involved have said that they want to shut me up.
[34:21.000 --> 34:26.000]  Wow, how un-American, how dangerous. If they want to live somewhere where there's not a Second Amendment, they should go there.
[34:26.000 --> 34:32.000]  Like Mexico that has a crime rate way higher than ours, or violent crime rate at least 10 times ours.
[34:32.000 --> 34:41.000]  Or the few areas where the Democrats have taken the guns, like Chicago or DC, and they go experience the highest crime rates there as well, because that's where the criminals go.
[34:41.000 --> 34:49.000]  More and more than we have sanctuary cities for gun owners that aren't following Democrat state laws. So there's more than one way to skin a cat.
[34:49.000 --> 35:00.000]  Norm Pattis is my great lawyer up in Connecticut who is handling our case there on the First Amendment that the same law firm is trying to eviscerate.
[35:00.000 --> 35:12.000]  And we have this law of 2005 protection of lawful commerce in arms act, and the Supreme Court's saying, hey, we're going to let this lawsuit that's been going on for years that bankrupt and Remington continue on.
[35:12.000 --> 35:17.000]  And that means all the other gun manufacturers are going to be fair game. They're going to say, oh, they advertised it wrong or whatever.
[35:17.000 --> 35:27.000]  You know, you've heard Beto, oh, these guns are designed to kill people. They're military arms. They're not for hunting. That's what guns are. They're designed to kill people.
[35:27.000 --> 35:33.000]  And they're designed to protect you so you have that deterrent. But if they can sell the idea that, well, this is meant to kill people.
[35:33.000 --> 35:39.000]  Yeah, they come to my house and try to hurt me and my family. That's what Kurt Russell talked about in the clip we played earlier.
[35:39.000 --> 35:46.000]  We're going to go to Norm here in a moment. Please don't forget that they are trying to bankrupt us with these suits and these attacks.
[35:46.000 --> 35:50.000]  And I'll always be on air. I'll always be able to speak out. We're always going to have a platform.
[35:50.000 --> 35:58.000]  But if they shut down info wars, particularly that is built up with a great crew, with a knowledge base that needs to stay in the game.
[35:58.000 --> 36:10.000]  And so we've got a lot of projects going, a lot of things we haven't announced, but funding so that we can do a lot of creative things in 2020 and beyond is critical.
[36:10.000 --> 36:18.000]  That's what they want to shut down. So I've never gone a week over on a sale, extending it for a week, usually two days or so.
[36:18.000 --> 36:27.000]  This is over a week. We've extended the everything must go 40 to 70% off super sales for shipping double tangerine points because I'm so busy with the news.
[36:27.000 --> 36:38.000]  And so busy with what's happening and going on and unfolding and discovery in these lawsuits that they've followed like four of them on me here in Texas.
[36:38.000 --> 36:47.000]  The same crowd that I've not had my head in the game when it comes to that, which is good for all of you out there because we've got a lot of these big specials.
[36:47.000 --> 36:52.000]  Now, a lot of things have sold out or almost sold out. A lot of these great items haven't sold out.
[36:52.000 --> 36:58.000]  So you want to take advantage of the stores for shipping double patriot points and those big sales and this came in.
[36:58.000 --> 37:13.000]  We get more next month, but this is going to sell out the first run of super silver whitening toothpaste with the above sea coral calcium that remeliorizes the teeth while whitening them with the patented nano silver.
[37:13.000 --> 37:18.000]  This is approved silver. Nobody else has that. And it has so much more in it.
[37:18.000 --> 37:27.000]  It's just an incredible toothpaste. Knocks out the gingivitis, all the bad bacteria and viruses. It's unprecedented. No fluoride, winter mint.
[37:27.000 --> 37:31.000]  And there's no reviews of that yet because it just came out.
[37:31.000 --> 37:39.000]  But if you look at the super silver that has the iodine as well, isn't competing. It's another great toothpaste we have the original.
[37:39.000 --> 37:45.000]  It's got thousands and thousands and thousands of five star reviews at 98% review rate, but this is next level.
[37:45.000 --> 37:50.000]  I believe this is the best toothpaste on the planet. Nobody else has anything like this.
[37:50.000 --> 37:53.000]  Regular super blue is basically sold out. So it's at regular price.
[37:53.000 --> 37:59.000]  But the children's bubblegum flavor with iodine, colloidal silver, no fluoride. So it won't lower their IQ.
[37:59.000 --> 38:03.000]  That's 50% off. But that's going to have to end soon as well.
[38:03.000 --> 38:09.000]  So thank you all for your support. Now joining us, and I appreciate him joining us.
[38:09.000 --> 38:12.000]  Because he's a very, very busy man.
[38:12.000 --> 38:18.000]  He's Norm Pattis. Norm, I know you're a classical liberal. I wouldn't even call you a conservative.
[38:18.000 --> 38:25.000]  But I know this morning we talked, you've been blown away by this ruling and you thought it was pretty scary.
[38:25.000 --> 38:29.000]  And you were marrying some of my concerns as a layperson.
[38:29.000 --> 38:32.000]  Can you tell us what the Supreme Court just did?
[38:32.000 --> 38:38.000]  Yeah, so the Connecticut Supreme Court ruled in a five, excuse me, a fourth, three decision by one vote
[38:38.000 --> 38:45.000]  that the lawsuit against Remington could continue, notwithstanding a federal statute that granted immunity to gun dealers
[38:45.000 --> 38:48.000]  for engaging in lawful commerce.
[38:48.000 --> 38:53.000]  And Connecticut did tell by application of something called the Connecticut unfair trade practice act.
[38:53.000 --> 39:00.000]  The Connecticut ruling held that notwithstanding the grant of federal immunity, a gunmaker could be liable for false advertising in effect,
[39:00.000 --> 39:08.000]  or for advertising that was too aggressive by targeting this gun at young people who were not going to use it for military purposes.
[39:08.000 --> 39:14.000]  They had somehow become involved in prohibited behavior.
[39:14.000 --> 39:20.000]  I was shocked by that ruling because typically once federal law declares something immune, that's the end of the game.
[39:20.000 --> 39:24.000]  Federal law so-called preempts what goes on in the state.
[39:24.000 --> 39:30.000]  Connecticut, Remington took a petition to the United States Supreme Court and said, we want you to rule on this.
[39:30.000 --> 39:35.000]  We think Connecticut overreached and it filed what's called a writ of certiorari.
[39:35.000 --> 39:38.000]  In other words, a discretionary request to the court to hear this appeal.
[39:38.000 --> 39:41.000]  Today, the court announced the decision denying the writ.
[39:41.000 --> 39:44.000]  They're not even going to hear arguments on this matter.
[39:44.000 --> 39:49.000]  And so I am shocked and candidly I'm deeply troubled.
[39:49.000 --> 39:55.000]  This is Connecticut, people are very sympathetic to the Sandy Hill climate.
[39:55.000 --> 40:01.000]  Litigation will go forward and it's likely that there'll be an enormous verdict rendered on behalf of the Sandy Hill parents.
[40:01.000 --> 40:10.000]  That money will undoubtedly go into the war chest for the attack on the First Amendment in the case involving Info Wars and UL,
[40:10.000 --> 40:15.000]  which is also in part a very creative application of the Connecticut unfair trade practice act.
[40:15.000 --> 40:22.000]  They want to say in your lawsuit that because you engage in speech which they regard as false,
[40:22.000 --> 40:29.000]  this somehow amounts to false advertising because people who buy you or watch you rather may buy Info Wars product.
[40:29.000 --> 40:34.000]  That there has never been an application of the unfair trade practice act like that.
[40:34.000 --> 40:41.000]  You don't criminalize commercial conduct as the result of political speech, but that's what's at stake here.
[40:41.000 --> 40:46.000]  So it was a huge victory for the Sandy Hill parents, a huge victory for the Costco firm.
[40:46.000 --> 40:53.000]  I'm not sure it was much of a victory for the rule of law and I'm deeply, deeply disappointed in the United States Supreme Court.
[40:53.000 --> 41:00.000]  I thought the scope of the preemption doctrine was a very important legal issue that needed to be addressed.
[41:00.000 --> 41:07.000]  I suspect that we'll see action on the floor of Congress to address this issue sometime in the next term or two.
[41:07.000 --> 41:14.000]  But notice we don't have the House of Representatives anymore and the shadows are getting very, very long.
[41:14.000 --> 41:16.000]  The sun is setting on this country.
[41:16.000 --> 41:25.000]  There is a premeditated focused international corporate move to eviscerate not just the second, but the first as well.
[41:25.000 --> 41:31.000]  And as you stated, these law firms, the Democrats, Senator Blumenthal, whose son is involved in the suit against us,
[41:31.000 --> 41:37.000]  has said, I want Joan silenced. I mean, he actually says he's not allowed to have speech.
[41:37.000 --> 41:43.000]  Then he misrepresents what I've said, even though that speech would still be legal and awful, to then say I must be taken off the air.
[41:43.000 --> 41:48.000]  He then misrepresents what I'm currently doing, waving a red shirt saying I'm going out for Sandy Hook families.
[41:48.000 --> 41:49.000]  It's a total hoax.
[41:49.000 --> 42:00.000]  They keep reintroducing Sandy Hook and reintroducing victimology about the families saying I'm saying it over and over and over again.
[42:00.000 --> 42:07.000]  And again, Sandy Hook's become this magic skeleton key with which the Second Amendment, the First Amendment, America itself,
[42:07.000 --> 42:15.000]  must just disappear into fumes over someone on Prozac who stole a gun from his mother and went and did this.
[42:15.000 --> 42:20.000]  It's just absolutely insane, just on the face of it.
[42:20.000 --> 42:22.000]  And I've been looking for the specific ruling.
[42:22.000 --> 42:24.000]  I know you're a great lawyer and didn't have it a couple hours ago.
[42:24.000 --> 42:25.000]  You've obviously found it.
[42:25.000 --> 42:34.000]  So here we come back with Norm Pattis on the other side, exactly where he thinks this arose from and where he thinks it's going.
[42:34.000 --> 42:40.000]  And also who voted how in the Supreme Court, three to four.
[42:40.000 --> 42:43.000]  So we're going to discuss it all on the other side.
[42:43.000 --> 42:45.000]  877-789, Alex.
[42:45.000 --> 42:52.000]  877-789-2539, first time callers on air about the attack on the Second Amendment and where this goes.
[42:52.000 --> 42:58.000]  877-789-2539.
[42:58.000 --> 43:03.000]  InfoWarsLife has done it again with undoubtedly our biggest breakthrough yet.
[43:03.000 --> 43:07.000]  Super silver whitening toothpaste.
[43:07.000 --> 43:08.000]  This is proprietary.
[43:08.000 --> 43:13.000]  This is with the top lab in the country and it is incredibly high quality.
[43:13.000 --> 43:16.000]  This is the best toothpaste you're going to find.
[43:16.000 --> 43:20.000]  It's called whitening toothpaste, but really it knocks out the bacteria.
[43:20.000 --> 43:22.000]  It recalcifies the teeth.
[43:22.000 --> 43:25.000]  It does so many things on so many fronts.
[43:25.000 --> 43:32.000]  These beautiful tubes of super silver toothpaste are available at an introductory price of 25% off out of the gates.
[43:32.000 --> 43:36.000]  It's as low as we can go and they're going to sell out very, very quickly.
[43:36.000 --> 43:40.000]  Super silver whitening toothpaste is going to be a hit.
[43:40.000 --> 43:42.000]  I'm very, very proud of it.
[43:42.000 --> 43:47.000]  I want to thank my father, a retired dentist for spearheading this the last two years and developing it.
[43:47.000 --> 43:50.000]  It's 25% off out of the gates.
[43:50.000 --> 43:53.000]  It's as low as we can go because it's very, very expensive to produce.

[45:01.000 --> 45:06.000]  A few days ago, my 11 year old daughter came to me and she had her digital textbook.
[45:06.000 --> 45:11.000]  She said, Dad, they're teaching us about the periodic table and I clicked on iodine.
[45:11.000 --> 45:17.000]  And it says that 2 billion people have low IQs or mentally retarded on the planet Earth because they didn't get enough iodine.
[45:17.000 --> 45:19.000]  That's what you say all the time.
[45:19.000 --> 45:21.000]  But I've heard people say you're crazy and it's not true.
[45:21.000 --> 45:26.000]  But Dad, it's right here on the periodic table when I click it saying exactly what you said.
[45:26.000 --> 45:35.000]  And I said, I know, honey, that's why I have you take the high quality nutraceutical grade iodine is because it's why you're so vibrant.
[45:35.000 --> 45:36.000]  It's why you're so alive.
[45:36.000 --> 45:42.000]  It's one of the reasons that you're so much healthier and smarter than most of the kids you're age.
[45:42.000 --> 45:49.000]  And it just really blew her away to read it there for herself to know that 2 billion people, ladies and gentlemen,
[45:49.000 --> 45:54.000]  2 billion are mentally retarded on the face of the earth right now because of iodine deficiency.

[46:00.000 --> 46:07.000]  The rich queen of the deep state lost the 2016 election because she was arrogant.
[46:07.000 --> 46:15.000]  And the corporate whores in the media, busily covering up her giant pedophile in blackmail rings, thought that her victory was assured.
[46:15.000 --> 46:22.000]  Now that the enemy lost that election, they are awake and throwing everything they've got at us.
[46:22.000 --> 46:28.000]  And conservatives and nationalists, Christians and patriots, many of them are asleep thinking 2020's in the bag.
[46:28.000 --> 46:30.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we just lost Kentucky governorship.
[46:30.000 --> 46:34.000]  We just lost the Virginia State House the first time in 30 years.
[46:34.000 --> 46:39.000]  This is serious. We can win again and secure the gains we've gotten.
[46:39.000 --> 46:41.000]  Or we can see it all washed down the drain.

[46:54.000 --> 47:01.000]  Band.video
[47:01.000 --> 47:05.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:32.000 --> 47:41.000]  There is a war between multinational globalists that want to use our country's openness to buy it off, consolidate it and vertically integrate it.
[47:41.000 --> 47:45.000]  And on it, they're building a very tyrannical anti-human system.
[47:45.000 --> 47:47.000]  That's why you can't just go along with the takeover.
[47:47.000 --> 47:55.000]  I wouldn't be risking my life and fighting this hard if we were being taken over by some superior culture that was empowering us.
[47:55.000 --> 47:57.000]  I'd just join with it.
[47:57.000 --> 48:04.000]  But that's not what this system is, ladies and gentlemen. It's pure death.
[48:04.000 --> 48:13.000]  It's absolutely a corrupt system based on being lackeys, based on rigged, inside outcomes.
[48:13.000 --> 48:18.000]  And quite frankly, I always heard folks attack and demonize lawyers.
[48:18.000 --> 48:22.000]  And it is true that you need good lawyers to counter bad lawyers.
[48:22.000 --> 48:29.000]  But that the legal system in the past did not abandon the First Amendment, both liberal and conservative.
[48:29.000 --> 48:32.000]  But now the left has totally abandoned the First Amendment.
[48:32.000 --> 48:37.000]  And you've got Norm Patis filing a suit today.
[48:37.000 --> 48:40.000]  I don't know if you can get into it against Facebook.
[48:40.000 --> 48:42.000]  And I may join in on that suit as well.
[48:42.000 --> 48:51.000]  But there is just a total, not just giving up on the First Amendment, but a gleeful attack on it.
[48:51.000 --> 49:01.000]  And then courts will rule for Democrats to protect their First Amendment, like Trevor Noah.
[49:01.000 --> 49:04.000]  But then they won't rule for conservatives.
[49:04.000 --> 49:08.000]  And they think they can just unequally meet all that out.
[49:08.000 --> 49:14.000]  But in the end, we'll collapse like a banana republic, because always these type of rulings end up becoming system-wide.
[49:14.000 --> 49:18.000]  Once we throw out the Second and First Amendment, everything else is going to follow.
[49:18.000 --> 49:21.000]  We've already seen that. I mean, it was in the news yesterday.
[49:21.000 --> 49:23.000]  Amazon is listing you in your house.
[49:23.000 --> 49:29.000]  Well, I told you that years ago, and they want to run your life.
[49:29.000 --> 49:32.000]  We've just totally given up on what made us great.
[49:32.000 --> 49:38.000]  Norm Patis, I don't want to be a buzzkill here, but I just don't think you can overestimate how dangerous it is.
[49:38.000 --> 49:51.000]  The Supreme Court said, yeah, this five-year lawsuit that's already bankrupted Remington, trying to say that they are liable for what criminals do misusing their firearms.
[49:51.000 --> 49:59.000]  When Lanzett got it illegally from his mother, I mean, that on top of it, even their tenuous claim to false advertising.
[49:59.000 --> 50:01.000]  I'm not a lawyer, but I just don't see it.
[50:01.000 --> 50:04.000]  I'm talking to you this morning. On and off air, I think you agree.
[50:04.000 --> 50:09.000]  And then we don't even have a ruling. It's not even important enough to them or they don't want their name on it.
[50:09.000 --> 50:18.000]  I mean, we know from PBS that was there, if you believe them, that Thomas and Alito and Gorsuch spoke out and said we're abandoning the Second Amendment.
[50:18.000 --> 50:22.000]  That it's a constitutional orphan, disfavored right.
[50:22.000 --> 50:24.000]  They went on to say it's very dangerous to commerce.
[50:24.000 --> 50:26.000]  It opens up the door to bankrupt U.S. industry.
[50:26.000 --> 50:29.000]  Yeah, how can anybody do business here with crap like this?
[50:29.000 --> 50:32.000]  Why are you saying this is so dangerous?
[50:32.000 --> 50:38.000]  I mean, what it is is basically we don't know who ruled what is the denial of certiorari.
[50:38.000 --> 50:43.000]  They denied several score rates and the order list was published this morning.
[50:43.000 --> 50:45.000]  So I don't have a list of votes.
[50:45.000 --> 50:49.000]  I know I wasn't privy to the conference where the vote was made, but I know what the ruling was.
[50:49.000 --> 50:54.000]  And I know that I've spoken to half a dozen lawyers throughout the state in Connecticut and we're all shocked.
[50:54.000 --> 51:01.000]  The preemption clause basically says that when Congress or the federal law acts, those rights are off limits to states and their political
[51:01.000 --> 51:05.000]  agenda or whoever's controlling the political agenda in a state.
[51:05.000 --> 51:09.000]  So Congress declared that gun manufacturers were free to sell their product.
[51:09.000 --> 51:14.000]  And a Connecticut Supreme Court in a 4-3 ruling decided, well, not in Connecticut.
[51:14.000 --> 51:21.000]  In Connecticut, if you sell guns and they may be appealing to young people, well, that's going to be a violation of the law.
[51:21.000 --> 51:24.000]  And we're going to hold you responsible for what somebody does.
[51:24.000 --> 51:30.000]  In this case, what Mr. Lonza has done, that it will have a crippling effect on any manufacturer.
[51:30.000 --> 51:40.000]  Paradoxically, the ruling mirrors a so-called stream of commerce doctrine that was enshrined by the Supreme Court maybe 40, 50 years ago
[51:40.000 --> 51:43.000]  in something called Buick versus McPherson.
[51:43.000 --> 51:49.000]  In that case, a court held that when a car is placed into the stream of commerce and that the car is a defective product,
[51:49.000 --> 51:56.000]  all the people who participated in placing the car into the stream of commerce, including the manufacturer, the wholesaler, the retailer,
[51:56.000 --> 51:59.000]  all those people could share liability for an injury.
[51:59.000 --> 52:04.000]  I think with respect to firearms, because of their privileged position under the Second Amendment, the Supreme Court said,
[52:04.000 --> 52:10.000]  no, we don't want that ruling to exist with respect to something that people have a right to possess.
[52:10.000 --> 52:18.000]  And we're going to let manufacturers, we're going to declare manufacturers immune from items they legitimately place into the stream of commerce.
[52:18.000 --> 52:21.000]  That's a federal question that Congress decided.
[52:21.000 --> 52:28.000]  The Supreme Court today let stand a lower court carve-up, and that's going to encourage states to experiment with federal law
[52:28.000 --> 52:30.000]  in a way that will make the law chaotic.
[52:30.000 --> 52:36.000]  And so I am troubled by it, and it also implicates commercial speech, the speech of advertiser.
[52:36.000 --> 52:46.000]  And the court's decision to even consider this issue, to even consider the preemption issues, to consider the scope of commercial speech,
[52:46.000 --> 52:51.000]  to consider the impact of this on First and Second Amendment rights is deeply, deeply troubling to me.
[52:51.000 --> 53:00.000]  And candidly, as your lawyer in the First Amendment case involving Sandy Hook here in Connecticut, I'm stunned to see a novel application
[53:00.000 --> 53:06.000]  of a state unfair trade practice act used to chip away at one of the bill, one of the guarantees of the Bill of Rights.
[53:06.000 --> 53:08.000]  Today it's the Second Amendment.
[53:08.000 --> 53:10.000]  Tomorrow it's the first.
[53:10.000 --> 53:17.000]  Well, you know, we have very little Third Amendment jurisprudence about quartering federal troops in your home or state agents in your home.
[53:17.000 --> 53:24.000]  Well, we chip away at the Third Amendment as well, perhaps global warming, and the need to have firefighters present in California
[53:24.000 --> 53:30.000]  on a nearly round-the-clock basis will require homeowners to open their doors to firefighters at state command.
[53:30.000 --> 53:36.000]  I mean, many of us might welcome somebody into our home and invite them in if they're assisting us, but to have the state order it.
[53:36.000 --> 53:38.000]  Yeah, that's a different question.
[53:38.000 --> 53:44.000]  Well, by the way, Europe's outlawing questioning man-made global warming and their tax they want to have everybody pay to the Rothschilds, literally.
[53:44.000 --> 53:47.000]  So it's just on every front tyranny is here.
[53:47.000 --> 53:53.000]  And we're adopting what kind of China does, not not what the American system is.
[53:53.000 --> 53:58.000]  Norm Patis, thank you so much for your very informative information.
[53:58.000 --> 54:02.000]  Any closing caveats concerning this devastating ruling?
[54:02.000 --> 54:05.000]  No, I mean, I'm watching you today and I think you're right.
[54:05.000 --> 54:08.000]  This is a time for patriots to stand up and be counted.
[54:08.000 --> 54:10.000]  This is our country.
[54:10.000 --> 54:12.000]  This is your country.
[54:12.000 --> 54:16.000]  If you let it be taken away from you, that's on you.
[54:16.000 --> 54:24.000]  If you have a belief in the principles of liberty, if you have a belief in strict construction of the Constitution, if you think the Bill of Rights is worth fighting and dying for,
[54:24.000 --> 54:33.000]  I think the fundamental question you have to ask yourself today is what price are you personally prepared to pay to protect those freedoms because they assuredly are at risk.
[54:33.000 --> 54:44.000]  The average gun manufacturer doesn't even spend time defending the Second Amendment. They try to keep their head down and now they've gone after the classic, oldest American gun company Remington, the main supplier of our military for so long.
[54:44.000 --> 54:51.000]  And it's just unbelievable to watch these little petitions pull down Remington, bankrupt it and still moving forward.
[54:51.000 --> 54:54.000]  And now they want the very same law firm, our First Amendment. Thank you, Norm.
[54:54.000 --> 54:56.000]  Thank you, Alex.
[54:56.000 --> 55:02.000]  There goes Norm Patis, very famous constitutional free speech and criminal lawyer.
[55:02.000 --> 55:13.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, you understand that just in one Connecticut lawsuit, they filed more than 50 motions against us.
[55:13.000 --> 55:17.000]  That means Norm Patis has to prepare and fight each one of those.
[55:17.000 --> 55:21.000]  And I can tell you that he's been doing it for about a third the normal price he does.
[55:21.000 --> 55:26.000]  But imagine that guy's been in court over 50 times for me.
[55:26.000 --> 55:28.000]  One lawsuit.
[55:28.000 --> 55:34.000]  They filed over 30 of them. We've knocked out 23 of them.
[55:34.000 --> 55:47.000]  Seven were left. They filed like five others, but they've got the New York Times literally living in Austin offering people money to lie about me and they can't even get anybody to do it.
[55:47.000 --> 55:55.000]  Plus, I went to the FBI and we caught them in one of their deals and, well, they follow through on the extortion, you know, they'll go to jail.
[55:55.000 --> 56:00.000]  But that's the level we're at here. This country's fighting for its life.
[56:00.000 --> 56:05.000]  Get involved in the frontline fight. You'll find out how evil the other side is.
[56:05.000 --> 56:12.000]  They will do anything.
[56:12.000 --> 56:18.000]  They'll sue you and go for those unopened emails and out of 9 million right where to go.
[56:18.000 --> 56:23.000]  And then they'll find in the metadata, the child porn you never opened or never looked at.
[56:23.000 --> 56:30.000]  It'll be on the news that it's your child porn and you're sending out to all the little kids.
[56:30.000 --> 56:36.000]  A lot of folks say we better shut up. We better let these thugs run our lives. No.
[56:36.000 --> 56:46.000]  No, we're going to take them on head on because there's a God in the universe that's a trillion times a trillion times infinity more powerful than they are.
[56:46.000 --> 56:49.000]  And I'm not going to bow down to these scumbags and I know you're not.
[56:49.000 --> 56:56.000]  Now, I open the phones up and people are calling in about 100 different issues. Folks, we're talking about the second amendment being under attack.
[56:56.000 --> 57:00.000]  And then we're going to open the phones up again and call back some of the folks we didn't get to yesterday.
[57:00.000 --> 57:03.000]  I was going to do that on the move to try to impeach the president.
[57:03.000 --> 57:09.000]  And the fact that it came out that there was a plan to overthrow him and a plan to sabotage him and a plan to he signed an executive order.
[57:09.000 --> 57:14.000]  They throw it in the trash can. That's so many felonies that makes my head spin.
[57:14.000 --> 57:21.000]  We're in this war and Trump's got to act confident. The stock market goes down. I get it, but we are not in normal times.
[57:21.000 --> 57:24.000]  We are in insane times.
[57:24.000 --> 57:32.000]  Call for your number to join us. 877-789-ALEX-877-789-2539 on the second amendment.
[57:32.000 --> 57:36.000]  Where do you think this is going? I mean, gun owners think because Trump said that we're doing great.
[57:36.000 --> 57:40.000]  This is a devastating ruling.
[57:40.000 --> 57:47.000]  It'll take him a few years, but it builds a road to the gallows to hang the second amendment and shut down all business in the country.
[57:47.000 --> 57:51.000]  We sold secret 12 for four years and it was our number third best teller.
[57:51.000 --> 57:56.000]  We had to discontinue it because when you upgrade a formula, you are supposed to rename it.
[57:56.000 --> 58:03.000]  That new formula is ultra 12. It's twice as strong as secret 12. The very best vitamin B12 out there.
[58:03.000 --> 58:08.000]  It's got the complex system that lets your body absorb it and it does amazing things.
[58:08.000 --> 58:14.000]  It supports healthy nerve and brain cells, helps make DNA, helps the body produce energy, helps produce healthy blood cells.
[58:14.000 --> 58:17.000]  Essential for proper nervous system functioning goes on and on.
[58:17.000 --> 58:25.000]  B12 deficiency is a serious problem that could cause anemia, fatigue, weakness, constipation, weight loss, depression, poor memory loss, asthma, vision problems and low sperm count.
[58:25.000 --> 58:29.000]  Bottom line folks, you need ultra 12. It helps something in full war.

[59:04.000 --> 59:07.000]  This is the best toothpaste you're going to find.
[59:07.000 --> 59:11.000]  It's called whitening toothpaste, but really it knocks out the bacteria.
[59:11.000 --> 59:16.000]  It recalcifies the teeth. It does so many things on so many fronts.
[59:16.000 --> 59:23.000]  These beautiful tubes of super silver toothpaste are available at an introductory price of 25% off out of the gates.

[59:28.000 --> 59:31.000]  Super silver whitening toothpaste is going to be a hit.
[59:31.000 --> 59:33.000]  I'm very, very proud of it.
[59:33.000 --> 59:38.000]  I want to thank my father, a retired dentist for spearheading this the last two years and developing it.
[59:38.000 --> 59:44.000]  It's 25% off out of the gates. It's as low as we can go because it's very, very expensive to produce.
[59:44.000 --> 59:47.000]  Get yours today at infowarslife.com.
[59:47.000 --> 59:54.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:04.000 --> 1:00:08.000]  Now, coming up, Stuart Rhodes is nearby.
[1:00:08.000 --> 1:00:10.000]  He's been able to come in studio about the Second Amendment ruling.
[1:00:10.000 --> 1:00:12.000]  We'll have to take your phone calls throughout the next few hours.
[1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:21.000]  We have former lead man with the misfits, getting into the Satanism and Luciferianism and rock and roll that's admitted by so many of these individuals
[1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:23.000]  and how it's all coming out in the open.
[1:00:23.000 --> 1:00:28.000]  That's going to be in the third hour, a little bit into the fourth hour.
[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:33.000]  But I wanted to play this report from just a week and a half ago when Hillary came to town.
[1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:38.000]  Then we'll go back to break for one minute and come back and take your calls because taking action against the globalists,
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:43.000]  getting out the third dimension, shouting them down when they try to take our first and second amendment is critical.
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:01:09.000]  Here's the report.
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:38.000]  Here's the report.
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:48.000]  Hillary Clinton is the enemy of America.
[1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:54.000]  Hillary Clinton is openly calling for censorship of all takers and nationals.
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:02:04.000]  Hillary Clinton is a criminal who's failed to steal our nationals and it's called Hillary Clinton is a criminal.
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:09.000]  Hillary Clinton will never silence the American people.
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:12.000]  America is awake.
[1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:14.000]  America knows what's happening.
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:35.000]  America is back.
[1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:45.000]  Hillary Clinton is a criminal.
[1:02:45.000 --> 1:03:09.000]  The Democrat Party's attempted criminal takeover of America is failing.
[1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:18.000]  Democrats are a authoritarian, anti-American criminal that have failed to silence our states.
[1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:28.000]  Big Tech and the Chicoms and Hillary have failed to silence America's states.
[1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  America is back.
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:48.000]  Hillary Clinton will never silence America's states.
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:58.000]  Hillary Clinton will never silence America's states.
[1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:08.000]  Hillary Clinton will never silence America's states.
[1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:18.000]  Hillary Clinton will never silence America's states.
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:28.000]  Hillary Clinton will never silence America's states.
[1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:56.000]  Hillary Clinton will never silence America's states.
[1:04:56.000 --> 1:04:59.000]  All of our bodies are different.
[1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:02.000]  All of our metabolic systems are diverse.
[1:05:02.000 --> 1:05:05.000]  Some of us are deficient in some things and not in others.
[1:05:05.000 --> 1:05:11.000]  There's a lot of factors that go into this and I'm not telling you something that you don't know, but I'm here to tell you.
[1:05:11.000 --> 1:05:21.000]  Every time I commit and use the supplements that we sell on a religious basis, my life completely changes.
[1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:26.000]  I'm healthier, I have more energy, I lose weight, I look better, everybody notices.
[1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:33.000]  Two months ago I said on air, I am going to commit to take X2, body's ultimate turmeric.
[1:05:33.000 --> 1:05:38.000]  I'm going to commit to flush my gut out with the gut fusion from M4's life.
[1:05:38.000 --> 1:05:43.000]  And when I take these products, the results are nothing less than miraculous.
[1:05:43.000 --> 1:05:49.000]  Well, one product that's amazing that I use, I don't talk enough about is gut fusion, folks.
[1:05:49.000 --> 1:05:51.000]  Check it out, there's nothing else like it.
[1:05:51.000 --> 1:05:54.000]  50% off right now, the sale's about to end.
[1:05:54.000 --> 1:05:57.000]  GutFusion, importstore.com.
[1:05:57.000 --> 1:06:15.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[1:06:15.000 --> 1:06:24.000]  They're coming for your children, they're coming for your mind, they're coming for your health,
[1:06:24.000 --> 1:06:31.000]  they're coming for your right to self-defense, they're coming for your fertility,
[1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:39.000]  they're coming for your destiny, they want your soul.
[1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:49.000]  Life isn't about just chasing after things or having status with a bunch of empty people worshipping.
[1:06:49.000 --> 1:06:55.000]  It's about challenging yourself and others and discovering the secrets of the universe
[1:06:55.000 --> 1:07:06.000]  and dialing in to the spirit of God that like a space wind, blows through creation.
[1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:11.000]  Now, I don't normally say I'm going to not have guests and then have a guest,
[1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:16.000]  but we do have Stuart Rhodes driving up from San Antonio to be in studio when I called this morning and said,
[1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:18.000]  can you please come on, he said sure, I'll drive up in San Antonio.
[1:07:18.000 --> 1:07:23.000]  Because he's a constitutional lawyer, former advisor to Ron Paul, worked in Congress,
[1:07:23.000 --> 1:07:26.000]  an expert on the move to confiscate our guns.
[1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:34.000]  This Supreme Court ruling this morning has a total slap in the face to the Second Amendment.
[1:07:34.000 --> 1:07:37.000]  They said, we're not even going to hear it.
[1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:42.000]  We're going to allow lawsuits against gun manufacturers to go forward,
[1:07:42.000 --> 1:07:47.000]  even against Remington already bankrupted by all these suits.
[1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:55.000]  And Clarence Thomas and others were horrified in the notes that PBS had of what they said,
[1:07:55.000 --> 1:08:02.000]  saying that the Second Amendment is a constitutional orphan, disfavored right in crisis.
[1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:12.000]  Gorsuch and Alito agreed and they went on to talk about the fact that this endangers all commerce,
[1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:24.000]  because they can sue anybody they want out of existence by the Supreme Court trying to override the Protection of Lawful Commerce Act.
[1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:34.000]  Because if you can sue somebody because their car, their baseball bat, the knife they made, the gun they made,
[1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:41.000]  was improperly used by somebody else, well then you are going to let the lawyers take over even more of society.
[1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:44.000]  They've already made America almost impossible to do business in.
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:48.000]  That's why we're deindustrialized. They've cut our power off, our energy off.
[1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:56.000]  They have enough coal to run the nation cleanly for a thousand years, so HBO and all the comedy shows, Attack and Slander,
[1:08:56.000 --> 1:09:03.000]  the few industries we have left when there's no environmental standards in China, we're being shut down.
[1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:13.000]  Meanwhile, you see the end of judicial law with the House impeachment of total kangaroo show court,
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:18.000]  Star Chamber, I was saying all that a month ago, kangaroo court, show trial, Star Chamber.
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:24.000]  Now you see all those terms being used, because when you have dummy witnesses that have been coached on what to say,
[1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:30.000]  that's called kangaroos. It's an Aussie way of saying puppet.
[1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:37.000]  When you say people are being railroaded, it means that they've set up the beginning, middle and end and it's all scripted and rigged.
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  Obviously, the lawyers know that.
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:46.000]  When it's a show trial, you then have those fake witnesses and people up there putting the disinfo out for the TV cameras.
[1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:54.000]  Once you've gotten them all scripted and ready and under oath and prepared in the fake underground.
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:10:00.000]  Oh, when you have a wedding or whatever, when you're having a play, it's a rehearsal.
[1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:04.000]  And people are like, this isn't how it's supposed to happen. Why are they doing it? Why are they getting in trouble?
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:14.000]  Because evil is moving against good in mass. Why do you think Hollywood and Guardians of the Galaxy director and all these people come out and brag about pedophilia
[1:10:14.000 --> 1:10:17.000]  and how much they like it in them pedophile themed parties?
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:26.000]  Why do you think Disney hires people that are convicted child rapist of six year old boys and girls to make Disney children movies?
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:37.000]  Because it's a club and you ain't in it and I ain't in it. Thank God. You got to check your soul at the door like you hang up a jacket when you get into it.
[1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  Because let me tell you, you start raping little kids. You're damned to hell right there.
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:53.000]  It's the ultimate sin. You're not getting forgiven. You know what you're doing is bad. You're destroying somebody's innocence and God is going to remove himself from your presence.
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:59.000]  And then you look at these people. They're so ugly. They're twisted. They're crazed. They're unhappy.
[1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:06.000]  But they gave themselves to Satan for physical temporal power on this dirt ball.
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:11.000]  They failed in their test.
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:20.000]  But now, like a satanic zombie horde, they're coming for us and they want our speech.
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:29.000]  They want our right to self defense so they can have their way with us as psychos animated by their God always do.
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:36.000]  And I've got news for them. This is America and there's enough of a remnant left that it's not going to go the way you think it is.
[1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:42.000]  And they already kind of figured that out. So let me take your phone calls on the second amendment.
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  And we had some overflow callers yesterday that I promise if they're around today, I'll call them and get them back on because I respect the callers.
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:54.000]  We kind of have a catch-22 of 20 phone lines and that usually is as many as we can get to and then still something left up there.
[1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  But I'm going to try to bam, bam, bam, get to a bunch of these right now. Let's go to Brian in North Carolina.
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:09.000]  I cannot overestimate how devastating this is to the rule of law, to commerce, to turning the lawyers loose and a pathway to dismember what's left of the second amendment.
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:16.000]  If they can't get rid of the right itself, they will get rid of the right to manufacture, produce, even work on the firearms.
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:19.000]  What do you think about this development, sir?
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:26.000]  Hey, Alex. First of all, I want to say thanks for everything you do. It's something that we could never reciprocate to you. Everything you do there.
[1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:28.000]  God bless you, Alex.
[1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:30.000]  Thank you. God bless you.
[1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  This is a way of them circumventing the American voter.
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:45.000]  They think that we can elect a president. We can stand up for our second amendment, but they can just take the litigation and the lawyers and just take that all away from us.
[1:12:45.000 --> 1:12:51.000]  If you eliminate all the gun manufacturers, that's another way to eliminate the second amendment.
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:59.000]  By the way, I mean, lawyers are everywhere admitting this will allow them now to sue every other manufacturer of other things that can kill people.
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:01.000]  Absolutely, Alex.
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:08.000]  I mean, we voted for a president in 2016, and he has been bound and bound by lawyers and litigation the entire time.
[1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  I can't believe he's accomplished as much as he has, but then they want to take the lawyers and they want to go up to the second amendment through the back door, stop all the manufacturing of all the guns, and then eventually red flag all of us to where they can come to our door
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:27.000]  and they can take away all of our weapons and just leave us high and dry. This is just a bunch of BS out.
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:35.000]  Well, you're absolutely right, and they are training the police all over the country, and that woke the police up, by the way.
[1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  Most police aren't for it. We're at a fight constitutionalist. We're going to take their guns.
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:46.000]  Remember just four years ago, there were still newscast everywhere and police admitting we're being trained to take the guns, and a lot of jurisdictions said,
[1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:57.000]  we're not going to do this, but the federal funding is coming down. If we get the federal funding and armored vehicles, so they're doing high risk things on MS-13 or whatever, they do need those because people are shooting at them.
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:14:03.000]  But they said, as part of that training, we're told we're being given these armored vehicles to take guns. We're not going to do this.
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:15.000]  But other jurisdictions that I've played the clips are like, we're trained to take the veterans guns, and we show you that from Texas to Alabama to New York to Florida to California.
[1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:26.000]  And they have trained a lot of departments and put leftist police chiefs and sheriffs in that are chomping at the bit for a shooting war to take our guns.
[1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:34.000]  And you're absolutely right, and Bloomberg's funded thousands of these people being elected and putting these police chiefs and others in and bad sheriffs being put in.
[1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:41.000]  And they've admitted, like I remember Bloomberg headlines just speaking of Bloomberg a few years ago going, gun confiscation has begun.
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:52.000]  It was in California, it was in New York under red flag, no due process, and that's the plan. And they want to start a shooting war, a civil war over guns, and then call gun owners terrorist.
[1:14:52.000 --> 1:14:56.000]  That's the plan. They're already programming it. They're already preparing it.
[1:14:56.000 --> 1:15:02.000]  Alex, we need to take action. I mean, as a voter, we need to vote in the small elections, not just the big ones.
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:06.000]  Like, we had a city council voting here in Iardale County the other day, just a small little council seat.
[1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:11.000]  I did my homework. I did my research. I voted for the guy that I think had my back.
[1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:18.000]  So we've got to do that. We've got to vote in the school board, city council, all these little positions where the Democrats and the leftists just invest.
[1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:27.000]  And just everything leans to the left and they go up from those positions into the state positions that just take away all the right.
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:32.000]  You're absolutely right. They want the power. They're in the schools. They're everywhere. And here's the deal.
[1:15:32.000 --> 1:15:39.000]  They're all so corrupt. They have a lot to lose. If we simply stand up, they'll fall like a house of cards in a high wind.
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:44.000]  But we've got to be there. We've got to show up. You're damn right, Brian. God bless you.
[1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:50.000]  Greg and others. Gabriel, Tony, James, Meredith, Jeff, Reed, Jason, your calls are straight ahead.
[1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:55.000]  Newswars.com, infowars.com. It's an act of resistance to spread that link.
[1:15:55.000 --> 1:16:02.000]  Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain, the hottest financial sector without all the speculation.
[1:16:02.000 --> 1:16:06.000]  No, enjoy a 27% annualized payment each month without the ups and downs of Bitcoin.
[1:16:06.000 --> 1:16:14.000]  Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an equipment leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace.
[1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:22.000]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.

[1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:32.000]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house. I sued the IRS in one.
[1:17:32.000 --> 1:17:40.000]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since. I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[1:17:40.000 --> 1:17:46.000]  I can help you too. If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day. There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.

[1:17:56.000 --> 1:18:04.000]  The time has come to defy the thought police. They are banning hundreds and hundreds of symbols every year.
[1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:14.000]  They're waging war on communication itself as a Fabian socialist promise they would do more than 70 years ago from their command base in England.
[1:18:14.000 --> 1:18:22.000]  We've had Oxford come out and banned clapping. The ADL and others will literally bankrupt you, kick you out of college, destroy you.
[1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:31.000]  Have you arrested in some areas? If you do the OK symbol that's the international sign language symbol for OK, they know what they're doing.
[1:18:31.000 --> 1:18:38.000]  These people are authoritarians and they're dangerous. And the answer to their attack on speech is to exercise it in their face.
[1:18:38.000 --> 1:18:45.000]  We have a it's OK to be OK politically incorrect ball cap. It's black and white, very nice as the OK symbol on it.

[1:18:56.000 --> 1:19:06.000]  InfoWars Life has done it again with undoubtedly our biggest breakthrough yet. Super silver whitening toothpaste.
[1:19:06.000 --> 1:19:15.000]  This is proprietary. This is with the top lab in the country and it is incredibly high quality. This is the best toothpaste you're going to find.
[1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:24.000]  It's called whitening toothpaste, but really it knocks out the bacteria. It recalcifies the teeth. It does so many things on so many fronts.
[1:19:24.000 --> 1:19:33.000]  These beautiful tubes of super silver toothpaste are available at an introductory price of 25% off out of the gates as low as we can go.
[1:19:33.000 --> 1:19:39.000]  And they're going to sell out very, very quickly. Super silver whitening toothpaste is going to be a hit.
[1:19:39.000 --> 1:19:46.000]  I'm very, very proud of it. I want to thank my father, a retired dentist for spearheading this the last two years and developing it.
[1:19:46.000 --> 1:19:55.000]  It's 25% off out of the gates. That's as low as we can go because it's very, very expensive to produce. Get yours today at infowarslife.com.
[1:20:17.000 --> 1:20:23.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:27.000 --> 1:20:36.000]  We're going to Greg, Jason and many others here in just a moment. I want to make a point here right now. This is critical.
[1:20:36.000 --> 1:20:51.000]  They demonized me like I was a foreign country. We were going to invade for a good two years. The last year of the election and then a year after the election and change.
[1:20:51.000 --> 1:20:59.000]  About two and a half years of just total demonization, like a huge artillery barrage before a foreign army rolls in.
[1:20:59.000 --> 1:21:11.000]  So the guns were just boom, boom, boom. Sometimes a thousand syndications of an article a day. Sometimes more. Sometimes I get Google alerts that would say 3,700 new articles.
[1:21:11.000 --> 1:21:19.000]  And then a few of them would be this other Alex Jones woman on as a BBC morning show, but 99% will be Alex Jones.
[1:21:19.000 --> 1:21:26.000]  And lie after lie, or lie. The only other person more demonized was Trump. And I knew that it wasn't that I was that important.
[1:21:26.000 --> 1:21:36.000]  It was that they saw me as the art type of Americana and the populist resistance and they said that in CIA hearings in Congress saying my name.
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:53.000]  Directors of major operations saying we've got to stop Jones because once they could do that, they believe they could take everybody else down just like the same law firms that the Supreme Court just ruled against the Second Amendment for run by the Democrats are openly trying to get rid of the first
[1:21:53.000 --> 1:21:57.000]  amendment and then pursuing me and they say we're going to overturn the First Amendment.
[1:21:57.000 --> 1:22:01.000]  So think about that.
[1:22:01.000 --> 1:22:07.000]  And then once they had done enough demonization, they said, OK, now we're going to be platforming everywhere.
[1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:16.000]  And when the general public doesn't defending and when Trump doesn't come out defending and when the people don't come out defending, then we'll be able to take everybody off.
[1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:26.000]  And a year and a half later, it's just total women everywhere, particularly try to support Trump.
[1:22:26.000 --> 1:22:29.000]  They're blocked on Facebook, Twitter, or the women at a shooting range.
[1:22:29.000 --> 1:22:32.000]  They say this is part of a terrorist activity.
[1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:37.000]  Republicans, the leader of the Senate says, Antifa came to my house and threatened to kill me. They didn't block Antifa.
[1:22:37.000 --> 1:22:39.000]  They froze his account.
[1:22:39.000 --> 1:22:47.000]  You're like, that's outrageous. Exactly. Now they're talking about blocking Trump's Twitter because the president put up with it.
[1:22:47.000 --> 1:22:50.000]  Now he came out and said what was happening in full wars was wrong by name.
[1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:54.000]  He put some tweets out about us here and there.
[1:22:54.000 --> 1:22:58.000]  But I didn't want to eat a bone so I didn't starve to death politically.
[1:22:58.000 --> 1:23:01.000]  I wanted to save the whole country and the world.
[1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:06.000]  I'm not here thinking about me, me, me because I'm thinking about me.
[1:23:06.000 --> 1:23:09.000]  We lose the whole damn thing. Yeah.
[1:23:09.000 --> 1:23:14.000]  I'm going to get it. I'm going to have to sit there and watch my children get it and your children get it.
[1:23:14.000 --> 1:23:16.000]  And that pisses me off.
[1:23:16.000 --> 1:23:20.000]  I don't want to die, folks. I love life so much. I'm so happy.
[1:23:20.000 --> 1:23:25.000]  I enjoy everything. I enjoy food and exercising and my children and my wife and just everything.
[1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:31.000]  I love everything. I love changing oil in a car. I love beating somebody's ass. I love fishing.
[1:23:31.000 --> 1:23:38.000]  I love it all.
[1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:43.000]  But I don't like these pedophiles and devil worshipers and I can't stand by.
[1:23:43.000 --> 1:23:46.000]  That's what callers always say. Thank you. Thank you. Listen.
[1:23:46.000 --> 1:23:50.000]  Thank you for keeping us on air and keeping me in the fight. That's all I want.
[1:23:50.000 --> 1:23:53.000]  Because as fast as the blood's coming out, you're putting transfusions back in.
[1:23:53.000 --> 1:23:55.000]  That's all I care about.
[1:23:55.000 --> 1:24:02.000]  Because to think that what I'm doing is extraordinary and that what I'm doing is heroic.
[1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:06.000]  It's heroic to take on globalists that are destroying our own species
[1:24:06.000 --> 1:24:10.000]  and act like an alien species here to kill us slowly so we never realize what hit us
[1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:12.000]  and say they want to post human world.
[1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:18.000]  You mean wanting to survive and wanting to have a future is heroic?
[1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:25.000]  They know how to hit you slow with background radiation and propaganda and poison
[1:24:25.000 --> 1:24:29.000]  so that you get debilitated and never know what hit you and they admit that's their plan.
[1:24:29.000 --> 1:24:32.000]  And I am aware of it.
[1:24:32.000 --> 1:24:37.000]  Because if you're not aware, the ambient background actually makes you go to sleep,
[1:24:37.000 --> 1:24:38.000]  makes you slowly die.
[1:24:38.000 --> 1:24:42.000]  But all the studies show this, but I can see it. I don't need to see a study.
[1:24:42.000 --> 1:24:46.000]  If you're aware of an assault, if you're aware of an attack and you get highly motivated,
[1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:55.000]  not as a victim, but as an overcomer and then activate what God's given you,
[1:24:55.000 --> 1:24:56.000]  it's explosive.
[1:24:56.000 --> 1:25:01.000]  We are born to farm and raise families and be good people and work hard.
[1:25:01.000 --> 1:25:09.000]  But then we also are born that when a threat comes to rapidly shift into our other persona
[1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:13.000]  and start absolutely waging war.
[1:25:13.000 --> 1:25:16.000]  And that doesn't just mean knowing out and killing people.
[1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:22.000]  That's the end of it if we fail, as Lee Gohmert said a few weeks ago.
[1:25:22.000 --> 1:25:26.000]  It means getting aggressive in information warfare.
[1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:29.000]  And there's a trillion ways to do that. Just do it.
[1:25:29.000 --> 1:25:33.000]  And know that you're always, and I'm always thinking we've got to have some master plan
[1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:38.000]  that fixes it all in some one deadly stroke that unlocks it all.
[1:25:38.000 --> 1:25:41.000]  Well, getting Trump in there as close to that as you're going to get,
[1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:47.000]  but it's all the trillions and trillions of little actions of the many hands make light work
[1:25:47.000 --> 1:25:49.000]  that is going to be the victory.
[1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:52.000]  So longer segments coming up, I promise I'll write to your calls.
[1:25:52.000 --> 1:25:54.000]  Stuart Rhodes is coming in next hour.
[1:25:54.000 --> 1:25:57.000]  We'll push our other guests back a little bit and I'll take over some of Matt Bracken's time.
[1:25:57.000 --> 1:26:03.000]  But Matt will understand that.
[1:26:03.000 --> 1:26:06.000]  But this is a normal activity.
[1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:10.000]  If I was walking down the street and a pit bull ran up and bit me on the leg,
[1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:17.000]  I would start hitting it in the head and stomping it and trying to get it off of me.
[1:26:17.000 --> 1:26:19.000]  I wouldn't sit there and beat it in the head.
[1:26:19.000 --> 1:26:21.000]  I'd try to break its legs, knock its legs out from under it.
[1:26:21.000 --> 1:26:25.000]  That wouldn't be heroic. That would be called default.
[1:26:25.000 --> 1:26:30.000]  And I want everybody to get it in their mind that the default position,
[1:26:30.000 --> 1:26:34.000]  I know there are tens of thousands of businessmen and women listening right now
[1:26:34.000 --> 1:26:39.000]  that are nouveau rich and have a lot of property and are successful.
[1:26:39.000 --> 1:26:43.000]  They could put up airplanes in the sky over every town with messages on it,
[1:26:43.000 --> 1:26:45.000]  who could put stuff on the side of their trucks or barns,
[1:26:45.000 --> 1:26:47.000]  who could start their own local radio show.
[1:26:47.000 --> 1:26:52.000]  Whatever you do, you need to be leaders and get aggressive now.
[1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:55.000]  And there's more than one way to skin a cat.
[1:26:55.000 --> 1:26:59.000]  Let's say you've been a Democrat but you know this stuff's wrong.
[1:26:59.000 --> 1:27:05.000]  Go to their events, infiltrate them. They're all involved in corruption.
[1:27:05.000 --> 1:27:09.000]  That's a great job, but I mean, you scratch a Democrat, you scratch an operative.
[1:27:09.000 --> 1:27:12.000]  They're corrupt. So the first building he walks into,
[1:27:12.000 --> 1:27:15.000]  hey, I want to run kidnap children sex slaves.
[1:27:15.000 --> 1:27:17.000]  Every Democrat area he goes into, they go,
[1:27:17.000 --> 1:27:19.000]  yeah, we'll help you cover that up and run the money through.
[1:27:19.000 --> 1:27:21.000]  We do that ourselves.
[1:27:21.000 --> 1:27:24.000]  Just make sure you pay taxes on the kidnap children sex slaves.
[1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:26.000]  Remember that 10 years ago?
[1:27:26.000 --> 1:27:29.000]  He goes to another acorn facility.
[1:27:29.000 --> 1:27:31.000]  I want to run kidnap children sex slaves.
[1:27:31.000 --> 1:27:34.000]  Damn right. Join the club.
[1:27:34.000 --> 1:27:37.000]  You go to another event. I mean, it's like, yeah, we run scams.
[1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:40.000]  We're corrupt and able. Yeah, we steal elections is what we do.
[1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:48.000]  That's who they are. They're the bad guys.
[1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:51.000]  And the Republicans were just another wing of the Democrats for a long time.
[1:27:51.000 --> 1:27:57.000]  That's changing. Our populist movement is taking it back now.
[1:27:57.000 --> 1:28:01.000]  And so the Supreme Court just ruled that we're not even going to hear the case.
[1:28:01.000 --> 1:28:04.000]  Yeah, gun manufacturers can be sued.
[1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:08.000]  And held libel for what a criminal does with their firearm.
[1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:12.000]  And that, of course, will overturn all those other Supreme Court rulings
[1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:16.000]  that said that manufacturers can't be libel if someone misuses a product.
[1:28:16.000 --> 1:28:19.000]  You go by Drano, it says, don't drink it or get it in your eyes.
[1:28:19.000 --> 1:28:22.000]  If you pour it in your eyes, Drano is not libel.
[1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:28.000]  If you went to a park and threw Drano like just happened in China to 50 kids of school,
[1:28:28.000 --> 1:28:31.000]  you're a psychotic demon. You throw acid on 50 kids.
[1:28:31.000 --> 1:28:34.000]  Well, the maker is not liable.
[1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:37.000]  But the Supreme Court wants that end run.
[1:28:37.000 --> 1:28:39.000]  And you know they're blackmailing them.
[1:28:39.000 --> 1:28:45.000]  So four to three, they just ruled to screw the Supreme Court is anti-gun, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:28:45.000 --> 1:28:48.000]  And they just voted to screw the Second Amendment over. It's unbelievable.
[1:28:48.000 --> 1:28:51.000]  Did you hear? We're going to talk about it on the other side and take your calls.
[1:28:51.000 --> 1:28:58.000]  I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com, infowars.com.
[1:29:21.000 --> 1:29:25.000]  That's Black Rifle Real Estate.com.
[1:29:51.000 --> 1:30:04.000]  The Witch Queen of the Deep State lost the 2016 election because she was arrogant.
[1:30:04.000 --> 1:30:10.000]  And the corporate whores in the media, busily covering up her giant pedophile and blackmail raids,
[1:30:10.000 --> 1:30:13.000]  thought that her victory was assured.
[1:30:13.000 --> 1:30:19.000]  Now that the enemy lost that election, they are awake and throwing everything they've got at us.
[1:30:19.000 --> 1:30:23.000]  And conservatives and nationalists, Christians and patriots, many of them,
[1:30:23.000 --> 1:30:25.000]  are asleep thinking 2020's in the bag.
[1:30:25.000 --> 1:30:28.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we just lost Kentucky governorship.
[1:30:28.000 --> 1:30:31.000]  We just lost the Virginia State House the first time in 30 years.
[1:30:31.000 --> 1:30:36.000]  This is serious. We can win again and secure the gains we've gotten.
[1:30:36.000 --> 1:30:39.000]  Or we can see it all washed down the drain.
[1:30:39.000 --> 1:30:42.000]  Whatever you do, get more politically activated than you ever have.
[1:30:42.000 --> 1:30:46.000]  And spread the live links at band.video and infowars.com.
[1:30:46.000 --> 1:30:51.000]  If you want to defeat the Deep State, the globalist, then get fired up.
[1:30:51.000 --> 1:31:13.000]  Band.video.
[1:31:22.000 --> 1:31:25.000]  Well, what happened with Ultimate Female Force? Tell us about it.
[1:31:25.000 --> 1:31:28.000]  Well, it's really great. You know, it's like a multivitamin. I take it. It tastes good.
[1:31:28.000 --> 1:31:32.000]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste. It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.
[1:31:32.000 --> 1:31:35.000]  And, you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day, so I really like it.
[1:31:35.000 --> 1:31:38.000]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are.
[1:31:38.000 --> 1:31:40.000]  They're known to turbo-charge women.
[1:31:40.000 --> 1:31:42.000]  And then we get the organic ones and put it in it.
[1:31:42.000 --> 1:31:45.000]  So, yeah, stamina, libido, energy.
[1:31:45.000 --> 1:31:48.000]  These are amazing things in Ultimate Female Force.
[1:31:48.000 --> 1:31:54.000]  So I'm glad you plugged it. InfowarsStore.com, or CRIPLE-82533139.
[1:31:57.000 --> 1:32:00.000]  Serving with Infowars is a great honor.
[1:32:00.000 --> 1:32:02.000]  But I still need my morning coffee.
[1:32:02.000 --> 1:32:08.000]  And luckily, our break room at the Infowars headquarters is stocked full of high quality
[1:32:08.000 --> 1:32:12.000]  Infowars Store Patriot Blend coffee.
[1:32:12.000 --> 1:32:15.000]  Grown in the high mountains of southern Mexico,
[1:32:15.000 --> 1:32:24.000]  the Chiapas Farmers grow 100% organic non-GMO coffee at the ideal altitude for the perfect cup.

[1:32:29.000 --> 1:32:33.000]  There has never been a more important time to support Infowars.
[1:32:33.000 --> 1:32:40.000]  So if you love coffee, and if you want to fight for freedom, then you can help.

[1:33:20.000 --> 1:33:24.000]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil,
[1:33:24.000 --> 1:33:28.000]  but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[1:33:28.000 --> 1:33:33.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:33:33.000 --> 1:33:37.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[1:33:37.000 --> 1:33:40.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:33:40.000 --> 1:33:45.000]  Just two weeks ago,
[1:33:45.000 --> 1:33:51.000]  Lili Gomer said that we're in a revolution,
[1:33:51.000 --> 1:33:58.000]  and it's only in the final phases that the shooting starts.
[1:33:58.000 --> 1:34:02.000]  That seems like a long time ago, but it was just two weeks ago.
[1:34:02.000 --> 1:34:05.000]  And now, they're coming for your guns.
[1:34:05.000 --> 1:34:09.000]  They're saying they can sue all the manufacturers out of existence.
[1:34:09.000 --> 1:34:13.000]  The Supreme Court's overridden, they believe, it's a constitutional crisis,
[1:34:13.000 --> 1:34:16.000]  not more powerful, they're co-equal.
[1:34:16.000 --> 1:34:20.000]  But there is massive blackmail and threats going on.
[1:34:20.000 --> 1:34:24.000]  I've experienced it, the fake blackmail, the made-up garbage.
[1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:27.000]  But a lot of these judges and people have dirt in their closets,
[1:34:27.000 --> 1:34:35.000]  and they just ruled a majority to eviscerate the Second Amendment by another path.
[1:34:35.000 --> 1:34:40.000]  And to let lawyers sue manufacturers of any product that someone misuses.
[1:34:40.000 --> 1:34:43.000]  The examples of this are legion.
[1:34:43.000 --> 1:34:46.000]  And I've had a constitutional lawyer on agreeing with my analysis.
[1:34:46.000 --> 1:34:48.000]  Other lawyers coming in.
[1:34:48.000 --> 1:34:49.000]  Go to your phone calls right now.
[1:34:49.000 --> 1:34:54.000]  Greg is already experiencing the persecution, lost his payment processor.
[1:34:54.000 --> 1:34:56.000]  Yes, sir.
[1:34:56.000 --> 1:34:57.000]  Tell folks about that.
[1:34:57.000 --> 1:34:59.000]  We lost five of them.
[1:34:59.000 --> 1:35:02.000]  We had the best credit rating you could get at 2%.
[1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:05.000]  Now, we pay a 4% that cost a lot of money.
[1:35:05.000 --> 1:35:07.000]  And now, they're hunting, trying to find out those.
[1:35:07.000 --> 1:35:12.000]  They want to have international groups that go in and take all gun-related shops
[1:35:12.000 --> 1:35:16.000]  or companies or pro-gun groups right to commerce away.
[1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:18.000]  Wow, talk about Mark and the Beast.
[1:35:18.000 --> 1:35:20.000]  Tell us what happened to you.
[1:35:20.000 --> 1:35:23.000]  I've been listening to you for a long time.
[1:35:23.000 --> 1:35:24.000]  I agree with you.
[1:35:24.000 --> 1:35:26.000]  Listen to your words.
[1:35:26.000 --> 1:35:28.000]  I had my credit card processor.
[1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:31.000]  I didn't agree with them.
[1:35:31.000 --> 1:35:34.000]  So I've been trying to back up my credit card process.
[1:35:34.000 --> 1:35:38.000]  I don't use them a lot because the customers are savvy,
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:41.000]  but didn't use them very much.
[1:35:41.000 --> 1:35:44.000]  But they just said, we're taking your stuff.
[1:35:44.000 --> 1:35:49.000]  We're taking your ability to use our credit card processing.
[1:35:49.000 --> 1:35:51.000]  No warning.
[1:35:51.000 --> 1:35:53.000]  I have no violations.
[1:35:53.000 --> 1:35:56.000]  Just like you have no violations, have no nothing.
[1:35:56.000 --> 1:35:58.000]  They just sent an email.
[1:35:58.000 --> 1:36:03.000]  You're done because we don't agree with your store.
[1:36:03.000 --> 1:36:07.000]  Your business.
[1:36:07.000 --> 1:36:09.000]  Bye.
[1:36:09.000 --> 1:36:11.000]  No more credit card processing for you.
[1:36:11.000 --> 1:36:15.000]  You have a couple of days to find somebody else and you're done.
[1:36:15.000 --> 1:36:23.000]  Now imagine if you were a Muslim or imagine if you were a gay organization
[1:36:23.000 --> 1:36:26.000]  and they didn't like the books you were selling.
[1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:28.000]  They'd say, oh, that's discriminatory.
[1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:30.000]  Just like not baking the cake.
[1:36:30.000 --> 1:36:35.000]  Because you're a gun seller legally lawfully selling guns in the United States.
[1:36:35.000 --> 1:36:36.000]  They're saying you can't do that.
[1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:38.000]  They're saying you're a bad person.
[1:36:38.000 --> 1:36:41.000]  They're discriminating against you and they go, oh, well, they're a private company.
[1:36:41.000 --> 1:36:45.000]  No, they have consortiums run through a group called G2.
[1:36:45.000 --> 1:36:48.000]  That's really the CIA out of Boston.
[1:36:48.000 --> 1:36:54.000]  And you can have perfect credit, but they will put a hate designation on your company.
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:36:57.000]  It's probably been secretly done to you and then you lose it.
[1:36:57.000 --> 1:37:04.000]  It's been done to the NRA. The NRA pays almost 5% on credit cards out of one company left in Houston.
[1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:06.000]  The NRA has one processor left.
[1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:09.000]  People don't know how far down the rat hole we are, folks.
[1:37:09.000 --> 1:37:11.000]  That's what Hitler did.
[1:37:11.000 --> 1:37:16.000]  The first thing he did was not allow groups he was targeting to have access to banking.
[1:37:16.000 --> 1:37:17.000]  Oh, yeah, Alex.
[1:37:17.000 --> 1:37:24.000]  This spring, that same credit card processor Square, they bought Webly, my website host,
[1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:31.000]  and the same thing, their terms of service said, being a gun shop, gunsmithing business,
[1:37:31.000 --> 1:37:34.000]  I now am a hate shop.
[1:37:34.000 --> 1:37:37.000]  Oh, let's go further. Let's go further.
[1:37:37.000 --> 1:37:39.000]  Let's go further.
[1:37:39.000 --> 1:37:43.000]  Square is owned by Jack Dorsey.
[1:37:43.000 --> 1:37:45.000]  Oh, perfect.
[1:37:45.000 --> 1:37:47.000]  Perfect.
[1:37:47.000 --> 1:37:51.000]  Yeah, and then I get these business loan calls all the time.
[1:37:51.000 --> 1:37:55.000]  These robo calls, you answer them and they said, oh, no, no, no, no.
[1:37:55.000 --> 1:37:57.000]  You're a restricted business.
[1:37:57.000 --> 1:37:59.000]  Well, then quit calling me.
[1:37:59.000 --> 1:38:01.000]  Right.
[1:38:01.000 --> 1:38:03.000]  I'm a restricted business.
[1:38:03.000 --> 1:38:05.000]  I'm a legal lawful business.
[1:38:05.000 --> 1:38:08.000]  Well, Congress, Congress won't stand up for us.
[1:38:08.000 --> 1:38:09.000]  No, they won't.
[1:38:09.000 --> 1:38:14.000]  The Republicans that did, you know, the guy came to the baseball game and tried to kill them.
[1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:18.000]  People come to the leader of the Senate's house and say, we're going to stab you in the heart, Mitch McConnell.
[1:38:18.000 --> 1:38:21.000]  And then he did nothing to Twitter when they did that to him.
[1:38:21.000 --> 1:38:25.000]  These are terrorists that do whatever the hell they want.
[1:38:25.000 --> 1:38:27.000]  And they've got lists of everybody's homes.
[1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:33.000]  You know, I was talking to Michael Savage the other day and he had all these special operations guys at his event.
[1:38:33.000 --> 1:38:38.000]  And they said, yeah, Antifa says where we live, you know, they even come by and lays our houses.
[1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:41.000]  You know, not literally lays them, but mark where they are.
[1:38:41.000 --> 1:38:46.000]  And then all because they're in the military and we put up with this.
[1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:48.000]  That's George Soros.
[1:38:48.000 --> 1:38:53.000]  And I'm telling you, you know, these special operations guys, if they get given an order to go kill somebody, they'll do it.
[1:38:53.000 --> 1:38:59.000]  But I'm not putting them down, but where's the moral courage to actually get politically aggressive now?
[1:38:59.000 --> 1:39:01.000]  Because what are we going to do?
[1:39:01.000 --> 1:39:06.000]  At what limit will we not put up with these terrorists that our big tech is in our lives?
[1:39:06.000 --> 1:39:07.000]  They've moved to China.
[1:39:07.000 --> 1:39:09.000]  Apple's moved to China.
[1:39:09.000 --> 1:39:10.000]  They are spying on us.
[1:39:10.000 --> 1:39:12.000]  They are giving it to their political operatives.
[1:39:12.000 --> 1:39:21.000]  And then they're taking your credit card processing away because you fix people's firearms.
[1:39:21.000 --> 1:39:22.000]  Think about that.
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:24.000]  Think about who they are, my friend.
[1:39:24.000 --> 1:39:27.000]  Alex, I'm a disabled veteran.
[1:39:27.000 --> 1:39:29.000]  I was a former law enforcement.
[1:39:29.000 --> 1:39:31.000]  I've volunteered firemen.
[1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:32.000]  I've done nothing.
[1:39:32.000 --> 1:39:35.000]  I was a missionary for a couple years.
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:36.000]  Greg, you don't get it.
[1:39:36.000 --> 1:39:39.000]  It's because you're not a devil worshiper.
[1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:41.000]  It's because you are a veteran.
[1:39:41.000 --> 1:39:43.000]  It's because you still have a job.
[1:39:43.000 --> 1:39:46.000]  They don't want any Americans having jobs.
[1:39:46.000 --> 1:39:51.000]  These satanic lawyers want every damn job shut down.
[1:39:51.000 --> 1:39:55.000]  And the only jobs they're going to give to women, 65% of the graduates are women.
[1:39:55.000 --> 1:39:58.000]  They tell the women, you're in charge, men are bad.
[1:39:58.000 --> 1:40:00.000]  They're just phasing out humans.
[1:40:00.000 --> 1:40:02.000]  It's the end of the human system.
[1:40:02.000 --> 1:40:04.000]  It's the post-human world.
[1:40:04.000 --> 1:40:07.000]  And these women and people think, oh, they're in a position of power.
[1:40:07.000 --> 1:40:12.000]  It's all been actuaried out to make us obsolete and make us domesticated
[1:40:12.000 --> 1:40:14.000]  and make us not able to fend for ourselves.
[1:40:14.000 --> 1:40:17.000]  So you're target number one, Bubba.
[1:40:17.000 --> 1:40:18.000]  You're a veteran.
[1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:19.000]  You've been in law enforcement.
[1:40:19.000 --> 1:40:20.000]  You've been a firefighter.
[1:40:20.000 --> 1:40:21.000]  You fix things.
[1:40:21.000 --> 1:40:22.000]  You still have a job.
[1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:24.000]  You're the enemy.
[1:40:24.000 --> 1:40:25.000]  God bless you.
[1:40:25.000 --> 1:40:26.000]  Greg's the enemy.
[1:40:26.000 --> 1:40:35.000]  He's the bad man because he doesn't want to rape children for Satan.
[1:40:35.000 --> 1:40:37.000]  People keep thinking, oh, it's not that bad.
[1:40:37.000 --> 1:40:40.000]  Have you seen who the whistleblower's lawyer is?
[1:40:40.000 --> 1:40:46.000]  How he publicly says, I get pedophile security clearances
[1:40:46.000 --> 1:40:52.000]  and then just won't stop talking about children and how much he likes them.
[1:40:52.000 --> 1:40:57.000]  And how he goes to water parks by himself and takes pictures of little kids.
[1:40:57.000 --> 1:41:02.000]  And how he likes Jeffrey Epstein.
[1:41:02.000 --> 1:41:07.000]  Who do you think these people are?
[1:41:07.000 --> 1:41:16.000]  And they take our weakness as a green light to take over.
[1:41:16.000 --> 1:41:19.000]  So I'm sorry that's happening to you, brother.
[1:41:19.000 --> 1:41:24.000]  I know it's happening to me, but our listeners are still keeping us in the fight, but it's serious.
[1:41:24.000 --> 1:41:26.000]  Meredith and Kansas, go ahead.
[1:41:26.000 --> 1:41:28.000]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[1:41:28.000 --> 1:41:35.000]  I want to shout out to Mark Stevens, No State Project, Colleen and Nor, pewpew.com,
[1:41:35.000 --> 1:41:37.000]  for the Constitutional Second Amendment.
[1:41:37.000 --> 1:41:38.000]  Great guy.
[1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:43.000]  Also, Reed Enricks, Ballard Ridge, Constitutional Second Amendment.
[1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:47.000]  I think those two guys you should have on here, or at least talking to them.
[1:41:47.000 --> 1:41:53.000]  Brian Young, High Impact Vlogs, and High Impact Flits, and Band.Video.
[1:41:53.000 --> 1:41:58.000]  They've had me banned from Facebook, a local musician here in Wichita, Kansas.
[1:41:58.000 --> 1:42:01.000]  And it also keeps me from...
[1:42:01.000 --> 1:42:03.000]  That's fantastic, brother.
[1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:06.000]  What do you think about this in-run around the Second Amendment?
[1:42:06.000 --> 1:42:10.000]  I'll tell you what, I probably would be picked up if I told you.
[1:42:10.000 --> 1:42:14.000]  But the Liberty Tree is dried up because it's not been refreshed.
[1:42:14.000 --> 1:42:19.000]  And Benjamin Franklin said, if we don't hang together, we'll certainly hang separately.
[1:42:19.000 --> 1:42:21.000]  And that's where we're at now.
[1:42:21.000 --> 1:42:24.000]  To speed up here, you mentioned the Christmas list.
[1:42:24.000 --> 1:42:26.000]  I know what you were saying.
[1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:35.000]  I think there needs to be a 52-deck card, and the valuation of that card, the hierarchy,
[1:42:35.000 --> 1:42:37.000]  and how they're tied together.
[1:42:37.000 --> 1:42:43.000]  It'd be a great gift, but it'll also give patriots, if something comes to the down the path,
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:48.000]  at least we know where to rendezvous, at least we know where they're sleeping at night.
[1:42:48.000 --> 1:42:50.000]  It'd be a great card gift, I think.
[1:42:50.000 --> 1:42:52.000]  There's another thing.
[1:42:52.000 --> 1:42:53.000]  Yeah, we want to be...
[1:42:53.000 --> 1:42:55.000]  Hold on.
[1:42:55.000 --> 1:42:59.000]  We sold Secret 12 for four years, and it was our number third best-seller.
[1:42:59.000 --> 1:43:04.000]  We had to discontinue it because when you upgrade a formula, you are supposed to rename it.
[1:43:04.000 --> 1:43:06.000]  That new formula is Ultra 12.
[1:43:06.000 --> 1:43:11.000]  It's twice as strong as Secret 12, the very best vitamin B12 out there.
[1:43:11.000 --> 1:43:16.000]  It's got the complex system that lets your body absorb it, and it does amazing things.
[1:43:16.000 --> 1:43:18.000]  Supports healthy nerve and brain cells.
[1:43:18.000 --> 1:43:22.000]  Helps make DNA, helps the body produce energy, helps produce healthy blood cells,
[1:43:22.000 --> 1:43:24.000]  essential for proper nervous system function.
[1:43:24.000 --> 1:43:25.000]  It goes on and on.
[1:43:25.000 --> 1:43:31.000]  B12 deficiency is a serious problem that could cause anemia, fatigue, weakness, constipation, weight loss, depression, poor memory loss,
[1:43:31.000 --> 1:43:33.000]  asthma, vision problems, and low sperm count.
[1:43:33.000 --> 1:43:36.000]  Bottom line, folks, you need Ultra 12.
[1:43:36.000 --> 1:43:42.000]  It helps on the infowar, so it's a 360 win, and it's 50% off for a limited time at infowarstore.com.
[1:43:42.000 --> 1:43:47.000]  Again, we can only run the special for the next two weeks or so while supplies last.
[1:43:47.000 --> 1:43:49.000]  Ultra 12 twice as powerful.
[1:43:49.000 --> 1:43:50.000]  Half the price.

[1:44:14.000 --> 1:44:18.000]  It's called whitening toothpaste, but really it knocks out the bacteria.
[1:44:18.000 --> 1:44:20.000]  It recalcifies the teeth.

[1:44:45.000 --> 1:44:47.000]  It's 25% off out of the gates.
[1:44:47.000 --> 1:44:51.000]  That's as low as we can go, because it's very, very expensive to produce.

[1:45:02.000 --> 1:45:06.000]  Super silver whitening toothpaste.
[1:45:06.000 --> 1:45:11.000]  Super silver whitening toothpaste.
[1:45:11.000 --> 1:45:16.000]  Super silver whitening toothpaste is finally out of the line.
[1:45:16.000 --> 1:45:24.000]  Super silver whitening toothpaste is a greatниз70 систem but with large orbitals it get high in prices.
[1:45:24.000 --> 1:45:33.000]  Super silver whitening toothpaste is in the very last film, in which I used up my older motivatingers earlier today.

[1:45:39.240 --> 1:45:41.240]  I'm very, very proud of it.
[1:45:41.240 --> 1:45:43.480]  I wanna thank my father, a retired dentist,
[1:45:43.480 --> 1:45:45.480]  for spearheading this the last two years
[1:45:45.480 --> 1:45:46.600]  and developing it.
[1:45:46.600 --> 1:45:48.440]  It's 25% off out of the gates.
[1:45:48.440 --> 1:45:49.760]  That's as low as we can go

[1:45:56.680 --> 1:45:58.840]  All of our bodies are different.
[1:45:58.840 --> 1:46:01.600]  All of our metabolic systems are diverse.
[1:46:01.600 --> 1:46:04.760]  Some of us are deficient in some things and not in others.
[1:46:04.760 --> 1:46:07.040]  There's a lot of factors that go into this
[1:46:07.040 --> 1:46:09.560]  and I'm not telling you something that you don't know,
[1:46:09.560 --> 1:46:11.400]  but I'm here to tell you.
[1:46:11.400 --> 1:46:16.400]  Every time I commit and use the supplements that we sell
[1:46:16.720 --> 1:46:20.640]  on a religious basis, my life completely changes.
[1:46:20.640 --> 1:46:23.440]  I'm healthier, I have more energy, I lose weight,
[1:46:23.440 --> 1:46:25.840]  I look better, everybody notices.
[1:46:25.840 --> 1:46:27.320]  Two months ago, I said on air,
[1:46:27.320 --> 1:46:32.320]  I am going to commit to take X2, Body's Ultimate Turmeric.
[1:46:33.120 --> 1:46:35.560]  I'm gonna commit to flush my gut out
[1:46:35.560 --> 1:46:38.160]  with the Gut Fusion from InfoWarsLife.
[1:46:38.160 --> 1:46:40.280]  And when I take these products,
[1:46:40.280 --> 1:46:43.080]  the results are nothing less than miraculous.
[1:46:43.080 --> 1:46:45.160]  Well, one product that's amazing that I use,
[1:46:45.160 --> 1:46:48.880]  I don't talk enough about is Gut Fusion, folks.
[1:46:48.880 --> 1:46:49.720]  Check it out.
[1:46:49.720 --> 1:46:50.800]  There's nothing else like it.

[1:46:52.480 --> 1:46:54.000]  The sale's about to end.
[1:46:54.000 --> 1:46:59.000]  GutFusionInforstore.com.
[1:46:59.040 --> 1:47:02.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:47:07.480 --> 1:47:12.480]  Any successful species
[1:47:13.600 --> 1:47:16.240]  another world is territorial.
[1:47:16.240 --> 1:47:19.360]  Another time, any successful species
[1:47:19.360 --> 1:47:24.240]  in the age of wonder procreates aggressively.
[1:47:24.240 --> 1:47:28.280]  Another world, any successful species
[1:47:28.280 --> 1:47:29.680]  will stand its ground and fight.
[1:47:29.680 --> 1:47:31.680]  But the screen and wood,
[1:47:31.680 --> 1:47:34.560]  we are doing the crystal fact.
[1:47:34.560 --> 1:47:37.120]  If you are receiving this transmission,
[1:47:37.120 --> 1:47:39.120]  you are the resistance.
[1:47:39.120 --> 1:47:43.920]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[1:47:43.920 --> 1:47:45.960]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:47:45.960 --> 1:47:49.520]  And we're not giving in without a fight.
[1:47:49.520 --> 1:47:51.400]  And it's that fight that animates.
[1:47:51.400 --> 1:47:53.600]  It's the fight that is the journey
[1:47:53.600 --> 1:47:54.760]  that is the destination.
[1:47:56.760 --> 1:47:59.080]  Yes, the middle rights of Constitution
[1:48:01.440 --> 1:48:04.600]  points out rights that are already there that God gave us.
[1:48:04.600 --> 1:48:06.680]  But if you don't stand up for those rights,
[1:48:06.680 --> 1:48:11.680]  if you don't enforce those rights, they're gone.
[1:48:11.680 --> 1:48:13.960]  It's like having a forest of great timber.
[1:48:13.960 --> 1:48:16.720]  So if you don't have the mental tools
[1:48:16.720 --> 1:48:18.240]  and the architectural understanding
[1:48:18.240 --> 1:48:20.480]  to cut up that wood and build that house
[1:48:22.920 --> 1:48:24.560]  and then fill that house with all the things
[1:48:24.560 --> 1:48:26.320]  it takes to live and then have that wife,
[1:48:26.320 --> 1:48:28.760]  have that husband, have those children
[1:48:28.760 --> 1:48:31.560]  and then teach those children to be humans
[1:48:31.560 --> 1:48:34.280]  and teach them the skills that your forebears taught you,
[1:48:34.280 --> 1:48:36.560]  all of that's being removed.
[1:48:36.560 --> 1:48:38.920]  Thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands
[1:48:38.920 --> 1:48:42.640]  and upon thousands of years of human struggle
[1:48:42.640 --> 1:48:45.040]  to get to this point is all being stolen
[1:48:45.040 --> 1:48:46.440]  and taken away from us.
[1:48:46.440 --> 1:48:48.080]  We have more information than ever.
[1:48:48.080 --> 1:48:51.320]  The average person's never been more ignorant and stupid.
[1:48:51.320 --> 1:48:53.680]  Water, water everywhere and on the drop to drink.
[1:48:54.920 --> 1:48:56.480]  Best of times, worst of times.
[1:48:59.280 --> 1:49:01.200]  And people have been taught that it's not cool
[1:49:01.200 --> 1:49:05.960]  to like America or like freedom or like speech.
[1:49:05.960 --> 1:49:07.800]  The average millennial says arrest people
[1:49:07.800 --> 1:49:09.000]  if it's hate speech.
[1:49:09.000 --> 1:49:11.720]  Oh, I'm for free speech unless the Southern Property Law
[1:49:11.720 --> 1:49:15.200]  Center ADL or some corporate board of the UN says it's bad
[1:49:15.200 --> 1:49:18.280]  and then it's always new words, it's always bigger.
[1:49:19.720 --> 1:49:22.080]  Now it's the brofist.
[1:49:22.080 --> 1:49:25.240]  Now it's the okay sign or oh, just do what they say
[1:49:25.240 --> 1:49:27.400]  and they'll be nice, they'll be nice, they'll be nice.
[1:49:27.400 --> 1:49:28.600]  No, they won't be nice.
[1:49:29.640 --> 1:49:31.760]  They're not well-meaning liberals that mean well.
[1:49:31.760 --> 1:49:32.840]  They're criminals.
[1:49:33.760 --> 1:49:37.240]  They're usurpers and they work for the big money men
[1:49:37.240 --> 1:49:38.960]  that have overthrown countless nations
[1:49:38.960 --> 1:49:40.560]  and killed hundreds of millions
[1:49:40.560 --> 1:49:43.640]  and they want to kill Americans so bad, they can taste it
[1:49:44.760 --> 1:49:46.000]  because it's who they are.
[1:49:47.080 --> 1:49:48.840]  They got China and the globalists
[1:49:48.840 --> 1:49:51.000]  and they thought we were down and it comes Trump
[1:49:53.240 --> 1:49:54.600]  and then comes other nationalists
[1:49:54.600 --> 1:49:56.080]  and now they're accelerating their program.
[1:49:56.080 --> 1:49:58.800]  People are like, wow, they're all over the news saying
[1:49:58.800 --> 1:50:00.960]  they'd take Walmart's credit card processing away
[1:50:00.960 --> 1:50:04.200]  if they didn't stop selling guns or Dick's sporting goods.
[1:50:07.080 --> 1:50:09.040]  And those companies put their heads between their legs
[1:50:09.040 --> 1:50:12.480]  and kissed their ass goodbye because the average Walmart
[1:50:12.480 --> 1:50:14.760]  family is worth like 60 billion a piece.
[1:50:14.760 --> 1:50:16.160]  It's like five of them.
[1:50:16.160 --> 1:50:18.440]  They don't care, they were big American flags everywhere
[1:50:18.440 --> 1:50:19.840]  but everything's made in China.
[1:50:21.880 --> 1:50:23.760]  Like Zuckerberg told the newspapers a decade ago,
[1:50:23.760 --> 1:50:26.960]  he said, I'm gonna hold your hand like hospice
[1:50:26.960 --> 1:50:28.480]  as your industry goes bankrupt.
[1:50:30.840 --> 1:50:34.600]  And then those very companies didn't stand up to that.
[1:50:34.600 --> 1:50:35.720]  They went to Facebook and said,
[1:50:35.720 --> 1:50:37.800]  well, help us censor all our competition.
[1:50:37.800 --> 1:50:39.600]  Facebook said, sure, I'll do that.
[1:50:41.520 --> 1:50:42.360]  It's already happening.
[1:50:42.360 --> 1:50:44.440]  The credit card companies are already banning gun sales
[1:50:44.440 --> 1:50:46.000]  and they ask the question, could they?
[1:50:46.000 --> 1:50:46.840]  Duh!
[1:50:47.800 --> 1:50:51.440]  It's like Snowden on Joe Rogan's show.
[1:50:51.440 --> 1:50:54.080]  Oh, are Kim Trails real?
[1:50:54.080 --> 1:50:55.640]  No, no, I know everything.
[1:50:55.640 --> 1:50:58.440]  I'm Snowden, that doesn't exist.
[1:50:58.440 --> 1:50:59.800]  Oh really, they don't call it Kim Trails,
[1:50:59.800 --> 1:51:01.640]  they call it geoengineering.
[1:51:01.640 --> 1:51:04.360]  Then I can show you Smithsonian, CFR, videos,
[1:51:04.360 --> 1:51:08.080]  CIA briefings admitting they're adding to the jet fuel
[1:51:08.080 --> 1:51:10.480]  and doing it to, quote, protect the earth.
[1:51:10.480 --> 1:51:12.360]  But see, we're not supposed to admit that right now.
[1:51:12.360 --> 1:51:14.200]  Later, it'll all just be admitted.
[1:51:14.200 --> 1:51:15.720]  It's already admitted to kids' textbooks,
[1:51:15.720 --> 1:51:16.560]  because that's the kids.
[1:51:16.560 --> 1:51:18.720]  But for adults, oh no, no, that doesn't exist
[1:51:18.720 --> 1:51:20.040]  and Joe Rogan gets up there and goes,
[1:51:20.040 --> 1:51:23.080]  hmm, of course, there's no geoengineering going on.
[1:51:26.680 --> 1:51:29.160]  Because that's one of the little check boxes
[1:51:29.160 --> 1:51:30.640]  that you check off right there.
[1:51:30.640 --> 1:51:32.040]  There's no paedophile rings,
[1:51:32.040 --> 1:51:36.120]  there's no geoengineering, 5G doesn't hurt ya.
[1:51:42.840 --> 1:51:44.600]  And that's what we've turned into, that's what we are.
[1:51:44.600 --> 1:51:50.600]  So, that's what this nation's turned into.
[1:51:54.240 --> 1:51:57.400]  So that's why you're spreading the word is so critical
[1:51:57.400 --> 1:51:58.880]  and that's why buying the products is critical,
[1:51:58.880 --> 1:52:01.440]  because these are great products you already want and need
[1:52:01.440 --> 1:52:04.040]  and then you literally couldn't thumb your nose
[1:52:04.040 --> 1:52:06.440]  at the globalist more by holding us up
[1:52:06.440 --> 1:52:08.600]  against their onslaught.
[1:52:08.600 --> 1:52:09.760]  It's amazing.
[1:52:09.760 --> 1:52:12.840]  Infowarsstore.com, we've never gone a week and a half over
[1:52:12.840 --> 1:52:14.680]  with a sale, usually two, three days, I'm always busy,
[1:52:14.680 --> 1:52:16.640]  but at this time, I just haven't done it
[1:52:16.640 --> 1:52:18.920]  because we're selling out a lot of stuff.
[1:52:18.920 --> 1:52:20.600]  We've already had big specials, I don't know how else
[1:52:20.600 --> 1:52:22.320]  I'm supposed to have big specials.

[1:52:28.680 --> 1:52:33.320]  like DNA Force Plus, Turbo Force, the protein bars,
[1:52:33.320 --> 1:52:35.440]  VasoBeast is about to sell out
[1:52:35.440 --> 1:52:37.480]  and we've got a lot of great water filtration,
[1:52:37.480 --> 1:52:39.400]  air filtration, there's just so much great stuff there.

[1:52:49.000 --> 1:52:51.960]  And we also have the new whitening toothpaste
[1:52:51.960 --> 1:52:55.960]  that has the above C Coral Calcium
[1:52:55.960 --> 1:52:59.080]  to re-mineralize the teeth while it cleans
[1:52:59.080 --> 1:53:01.040]  some of the other toothpaste that remove it
[1:53:01.040 --> 1:53:03.080]  and it's got the patented silver,
[1:53:03.080 --> 1:53:05.600]  salt, nano silver to knock out the bacteria,
[1:53:05.600 --> 1:53:07.880]  the viruses, the gingivitis, it's incredible.
[1:53:07.880 --> 1:53:09.640]  The main gateway disease in your body is your mouth,
[1:53:09.640 --> 1:53:12.200]  look it up, a lot of heart disease is connected to it,
[1:53:12.200 --> 1:53:14.240]  add bacteria that can live in low oxygen levels,
[1:53:14.240 --> 1:53:15.960]  get in and get in the ventricles of your heart,
[1:53:15.960 --> 1:53:17.400]  that's all mainline medical stuff
[1:53:17.400 --> 1:53:19.400]  and this is the approved silver that's out there,
[1:53:19.400 --> 1:53:20.560]  it's the best out there.
[1:53:20.560 --> 1:53:22.840]  Theinfowarstore.com, no reviews on it yet.
[1:53:24.000 --> 1:53:25.840]  Everybody just gets their toothpaste from us
[1:53:25.840 --> 1:53:28.000]  and if you like it and sign up for auto-ship,
[1:53:28.000 --> 1:53:29.120]  we can find our operation.
[1:53:29.120 --> 1:53:32.480]  Hell, if 5% of the listeners got our toothpaste,
[1:53:32.480 --> 1:53:34.240]  we know it's less than 1% of the listeners
[1:53:34.240 --> 1:53:36.320]  that actually buy products at infowarstore.com.
[1:53:36.320 --> 1:53:39.440]  They're also the ones that call in, they're the 1%ers.
[1:53:39.440 --> 1:53:41.120]  So we salute you and thank you,
[1:53:41.120 --> 1:53:43.960]  not the 1% of the globalists that are 110th to 1%,
[1:53:43.960 --> 1:53:45.960]  but the 1% that actually stand up.
[1:53:45.960 --> 1:53:47.880]  Wasn't 3% when the Revolutionary War folks,
[1:53:47.880 --> 1:53:50.520]  it was less than 1% that let it, started it,
[1:53:50.520 --> 1:53:52.400]  stood through the whole deal.
[1:53:52.400 --> 1:53:54.920]  Maybe 3, 5% or so joined them later throughout it,
[1:53:54.920 --> 1:53:57.640]  but you are the 1% and I salute you listeners and viewers
[1:53:57.640 --> 1:53:59.880]  because you're men and women in the arena and I love you.
[1:53:59.880 --> 1:54:01.360]  No matter what color you are, where you came from,
[1:54:01.360 --> 1:54:03.080]  if you love God and you love justice
[1:54:03.080 --> 1:54:05.320]  and you feel what I feel and know what I know again
[1:54:05.320 --> 1:54:07.120]  and wanna stand against evil,
[1:54:07.120 --> 1:54:09.480]  you have a driving desire to not be a slave
[1:54:09.480 --> 1:54:11.240]  and to help others that we're brothers
[1:54:11.240 --> 1:54:13.760]  and sisters forever together and that's what matters.
[1:54:13.760 --> 1:54:15.120]  And God had to put us through this
[1:54:15.120 --> 1:54:19.520]  to make sure who we were before we get to the next level.
[1:54:19.520 --> 1:54:21.000]  So this boot camp is not fun
[1:54:21.000 --> 1:54:22.760]  and we're gonna understand the boot camp
[1:54:22.760 --> 1:54:24.720]  at the next level, believe me.
[1:54:24.720 --> 1:54:29.720]  And most people just can't handle it.
[1:54:31.360 --> 1:54:33.400]  I have seen past the veil.
[1:54:33.400 --> 1:54:36.440]  The globalists know that too, I've seen really far
[1:54:36.440 --> 1:54:40.120]  and I've seen things that are, let's just say interesting
[1:54:40.120 --> 1:54:43.640]  and I can tell you that this level of conflict
[1:54:43.640 --> 1:54:48.040]  is only the surface and the conflict is a lot bigger
[1:54:48.040 --> 1:54:51.680]  than we even know and a lot more serious.
[1:54:51.680 --> 1:54:54.000]  Let's just say the universe is a very interesting place
[1:54:54.000 --> 1:54:57.000]  and there are some big wars going on, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:54:57.000 --> 1:55:00.520]  So we need to get off this rock and go to the next level
[1:55:00.520 --> 1:55:04.720]  because God needs us and you'd understand that,
[1:55:04.720 --> 1:55:06.280]  ladies and gentlemen,
[1:55:06.280 --> 1:55:08.120]  because there's a lot of things going on in the universe.
[1:55:08.120 --> 1:55:10.960]  I'm gonna stop pontificating and go back to your calls,
[1:55:10.960 --> 1:55:12.400]  who's been holding the longest.
[1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:16.480]  Jason in Texas, thanks for holding her on the air.
[1:55:17.520 --> 1:55:20.480]  Hey, Alex, my fellow gladiator in the arena.
[1:55:20.480 --> 1:55:21.320]  Yes, sir.
[1:55:21.320 --> 1:55:23.760]  I still think that most people aren't paying attention
[1:55:23.760 --> 1:55:25.120]  so let me just say this.
[1:55:25.120 --> 1:55:28.440]  You are surrounded by an enemy that is relentless.
[1:55:28.440 --> 1:55:32.520]  You are facing an enemy that will not give up.
[1:55:32.520 --> 1:55:34.640]  What you permit is what you promote
[1:55:34.640 --> 1:55:37.040]  and what you allow is what will continue.
[1:55:37.040 --> 1:55:39.400]  They've already shot more holes in the First Amendment
[1:55:39.400 --> 1:55:41.800]  than they shot into the walls of the Alamo
[1:55:41.800 --> 1:55:44.320]  and they're after the Second Amendment.
[1:55:44.320 --> 1:55:47.480]  And if the American people don't grow a backbone
[1:55:47.480 --> 1:55:50.320]  and if those patriots don't grow some balls,
[1:55:50.320 --> 1:55:52.240]  there'll be no USA at all.
[1:55:52.240 --> 1:55:54.080]  You have to put an end to this.
[1:55:54.080 --> 1:55:55.720]  You gotta speak up to it.
[1:55:55.720 --> 1:55:58.200]  You gotta call them out on their nonsense.
[1:55:58.200 --> 1:56:00.360]  You gotta speak the truth to them
[1:56:00.360 --> 1:56:02.120]  and you gotta put an end to this.
[1:56:02.120 --> 1:56:04.000]  If they get your Second Amendment,
[1:56:04.000 --> 1:56:06.000]  which is the jewel in their crown,
[1:56:06.000 --> 1:56:08.360]  that's what they're after because a public
[1:56:08.360 --> 1:56:12.000]  that doesn't have the ability to defend themselves
[1:56:12.000 --> 1:56:14.240]  is a public that can be controlled.
[1:56:14.240 --> 1:56:18.280]  And this is a battle between self-determination
[1:56:18.280 --> 1:56:22.840]  and total tyrannical control.
[1:56:22.840 --> 1:56:24.840]  I don't think I've ever heard a minute of radio.
[1:56:24.840 --> 1:56:25.840]  More true, my friend.
[1:56:25.840 --> 1:56:27.040]  What else do you think we should do?
[1:56:27.040 --> 1:56:29.120]  I mean, because yes, the war is now
[1:56:29.120 --> 1:56:30.560]  and these people are relentless
[1:56:30.560 --> 1:56:33.240]  because it's a spiritual fight.
[1:56:33.240 --> 1:56:34.520]  It is a spiritual battle.
[1:56:34.520 --> 1:56:38.080]  And the reason why is because good Christian people
[1:56:38.080 --> 1:56:40.960]  have permitted a lot of things to happen.
[1:56:40.960 --> 1:56:42.480]  By controlling the language,
[1:56:42.480 --> 1:56:44.200]  they can control what you think.
[1:56:44.200 --> 1:56:45.720]  By controlling your thoughts,
[1:56:45.720 --> 1:56:48.880]  they can control your actions and thought proceeds actions
[1:56:48.880 --> 1:56:51.440]  and it keeps you in a very controllable state.
[1:56:51.440 --> 1:56:53.520]  And then whatever you allow to happen,
[1:56:53.520 --> 1:56:56.400]  there was a time in history when Christians control
[1:56:56.400 --> 1:56:59.400]  this arena so powerfully that cockroaches
[1:56:59.400 --> 1:57:01.960]  like these people had to live in the shadows
[1:57:01.960 --> 1:57:03.520]  and do their business in the shadows
[1:57:03.520 --> 1:57:04.800]  and under the cover of darkness.
[1:57:04.800 --> 1:57:07.640]  Now it is in plain sight, it is in daylight
[1:57:07.640 --> 1:57:09.240]  and there is not enough good Christians
[1:57:09.240 --> 1:57:11.480]  that are calling them exactly what they are,
[1:57:11.480 --> 1:57:15.760]  which are demons and they need to be hunted, found
[1:57:15.760 --> 1:57:18.720]  and politically assassinated is what they need to be.
[1:57:19.960 --> 1:57:21.400]  Absolutely, brother.
[1:57:21.400 --> 1:57:23.000]  We're gonna do this new caller show soon.
[1:57:23.000 --> 1:57:23.840]  Get his name and number.
[1:57:23.840 --> 1:57:25.600]  That's another, all these callers should be on the show
[1:57:25.600 --> 1:57:27.200]  but we're gonna start more live shows.
[1:57:27.200 --> 1:57:28.320]  They're caller driven.
[1:57:28.320 --> 1:57:29.560]  I'm trying to get the more calls here on air
[1:57:29.560 --> 1:57:31.160]  as you've been hearing and you guys are awesome.
[1:57:31.160 --> 1:57:32.440]  Thank you.
[1:57:32.440 --> 1:57:34.680]  Wow, listen how well spoken and powerful
[1:57:34.680 --> 1:57:36.280]  our people are versus the enemy.
[1:57:37.280 --> 1:57:39.560]  It's so crazy, so many people sell out to evil.
[1:57:39.560 --> 1:57:40.480]  It's incredible.
[1:57:40.480 --> 1:57:42.040]  We'll be right back with the next hour.
[1:57:42.040 --> 1:57:44.640]  Stuart Rosalind Studio, more calls, stay with us.
[1:57:45.840 --> 1:57:48.000]  The Alex Jones Show.
[1:57:48.000 --> 1:57:51.160]  A few days ago, my 11 year old daughter came to me
[1:57:51.160 --> 1:57:53.240]  and she had her digital textbook.
[1:57:53.240 --> 1:57:55.000]  She said, dad, they're teaching us
[1:57:55.000 --> 1:57:57.960]  about the periodic table and I clicked on iodine
[1:57:57.960 --> 1:58:00.560]  and it says that 2 billion people have low IQs
[1:58:00.560 --> 1:58:02.960]  or mentally retarded on the planet Earth
[1:58:02.960 --> 1:58:04.160]  because they didn't get enough iodine.
[1:58:04.160 --> 1:58:06.080]  That's what you say all the time
[1:58:06.080 --> 1:58:08.320]  but I've heard people say you're crazy and it's not true
[1:58:08.320 --> 1:58:11.080]  but dad, it's right here on the periodic table
[1:58:11.080 --> 1:58:13.440]  when I click it saying exactly what you said.
[1:58:13.440 --> 1:58:16.480]  And I said, I know honey, that's why I have you take
[1:58:16.480 --> 1:58:19.200]  the high quality pharmaceutical grade iodine
[1:58:19.200 --> 1:58:21.880]  is because it's why you're so vibrant,
[1:58:21.880 --> 1:58:22.920]  it's why you're so alive.
[1:58:22.920 --> 1:58:27.080]  It's one of the reasons that you're so much healthier
[1:58:27.080 --> 1:58:29.120]  and smarter than most of the kids you're age
[1:58:29.120 --> 1:58:31.880]  and it just really blew her away to read it there
[1:58:31.880 --> 1:58:35.440]  for herself and to know that 2 billion people,
[1:58:35.440 --> 1:58:38.560]  ladies and gentlemen, 2 billion are mentally retarded
[1:58:38.560 --> 1:58:39.680]  on the face of the Earth right now
[1:58:39.680 --> 1:58:41.280]  because of iodine deficiency.
[1:58:41.280 --> 1:58:43.440]  Research it and find out for yourself now.
[1:58:43.440 --> 1:58:45.560]  Infowars.com.
[1:58:46.560 --> 1:58:48.640]  Josh in Washington, you're on the air, go ahead.
[1:58:48.640 --> 1:58:50.040]  Alex, God bless you.
[1:58:50.040 --> 1:58:53.160]  I have an idea for a new Infowars t-shirt instead of
[1:58:53.160 --> 1:58:55.680]  this is your brain, this is your brain on drugs,
[1:58:55.680 --> 1:58:58.440]  this is your brain, this is your brain on 5G.
[1:58:58.440 --> 1:58:59.280]  Ooh, yeah.
[1:58:59.280 --> 1:59:00.480]  Showing your brain, getting fried.
[1:59:00.480 --> 1:59:02.320]  Then I have some comments on your supplements, man.
[1:59:02.320 --> 1:59:05.240]  Totally changed my life, I use turbo force, bodies,
[1:59:05.240 --> 1:59:08.360]  album power, brain force, fish oil, ultra 12 daily,
[1:59:08.360 --> 1:59:09.680]  X2 every several days.
[1:59:09.680 --> 1:59:12.320]  Now, what I've found is really combining them
[1:59:12.320 --> 1:59:16.080]  is totally synergistic and transcendent feeling
[1:59:16.080 --> 1:59:17.720]  that I get by combining all your products
[1:59:17.720 --> 1:59:19.240]  and I just wanna urge all your listeners
[1:59:19.240 --> 1:59:21.160]  who haven't tried them, I just wanna say why not.
[1:59:21.160 --> 1:59:23.560]  Well, you're right that all of these things are known
[1:59:23.560 --> 1:59:25.200]  to be incredible, whether it's turmeric
[1:59:25.200 --> 1:59:27.400]  or whether it's the fish oil or the krill oil
[1:59:27.400 --> 1:59:29.440]  or whether it's the DNA force with the CoQ10
[1:59:29.440 --> 1:59:30.960]  and BioPQQ and all the rest of it.
[1:59:30.960 --> 1:59:33.040]  All of these are things that are like rocket fuel
[1:59:33.040 --> 1:59:35.240]  on the body, you take these bases together,
[1:59:35.240 --> 1:59:36.680]  then you have your foundation,
[1:59:36.680 --> 1:59:38.480]  now you can build the big strong temple.
[1:59:38.480 --> 1:59:39.920]  With these products I take,
[1:59:39.920 --> 1:59:41.280]  when I religiously remember to take them,
[1:59:41.280 --> 1:59:42.520]  it makes my life so much better
[1:59:42.520 --> 1:59:44.280]  and then it funds the information war,
[1:59:44.280 --> 1:59:45.280]  which is so critical.
[1:59:45.280 --> 1:59:46.920]  Thank you so much, God bless you.
[1:59:50.000 --> 1:59:53.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:59:53.040 --> 2:00:00.040]  It is Tuesday, November 12th, 2019.
[2:00:14.320 --> 2:00:16.880]  I'm gonna get Stuart Rhodes in here.
[2:00:16.880 --> 2:00:19.440]  Constitutional lawyer, Donner of Both Keepers.
[2:00:19.440 --> 2:00:22.320]  Wake up, boys, there's a light
[2:00:22.320 --> 2:00:24.880]  at the window to break down.
[2:00:24.880 --> 2:00:28.200]  I can hear what's happening and what's unfolding.
[2:00:28.200 --> 2:00:31.040]  So we'll do that after this short break
[2:00:31.040 --> 2:00:34.920]  and then Mr. Graves will be in here as well
[2:00:34.920 --> 2:00:38.040]  to get in to the occultism of the globalist.
[2:00:38.040 --> 2:00:40.480]  But we haven't played that music in a while,
[2:00:40.480 --> 2:00:42.360]  Christopher Revolution.
[2:00:42.360 --> 2:00:46.720]  We should play that, part of that at the bottom of the hour
[2:00:46.720 --> 2:00:49.000]  that I'm gonna air this report on Satanism
[2:00:49.000 --> 2:00:54.000]  and the globalist and you're gonna be able to hear
[2:00:54.120 --> 2:00:57.840]  from Michael Graves about the occultism in rock and roll
[2:00:57.840 --> 2:01:00.760]  and why it's so flagrant and why they act like
[2:01:00.760 --> 2:01:04.160]  it's all just fun and games so that it's funny
[2:01:04.160 --> 2:01:06.400]  so you don't realize how real the devil is.
[2:01:06.400 --> 2:01:08.760]  I'm gonna continue with your phone calls as well
[2:01:08.760 --> 2:01:11.480]  that Matt Bracken will host the last 30 minutes today.
[2:01:11.480 --> 2:01:13.400]  I'm taking a little bit of the fourth hour
[2:01:13.400 --> 2:01:15.000]  because we're behind here and I wanna take calls
[2:01:15.000 --> 2:01:17.480]  the Supreme Court has come out in a devastating
[2:01:17.480 --> 2:01:19.040]  and run around the second amendment
[2:01:19.040 --> 2:01:21.000]  and said that all the manufacturers can be sued
[2:01:21.000 --> 2:01:23.720]  into oblivion even if someone stole a weapon
[2:01:23.720 --> 2:01:25.240]  and improperly used it.
[2:01:25.240 --> 2:01:28.280]  This is just the most wide open case ever.
[2:01:28.280 --> 2:01:31.880]  And again, the establishment is that's helped fund
[2:01:31.880 --> 2:01:33.960]  and run the mass murder of hundreds of millions
[2:01:33.960 --> 2:01:36.400]  of people after they disarm them in communist China
[2:01:36.400 --> 2:01:39.840]  and Russia and other places is again using children
[2:01:39.840 --> 2:01:41.560]  as their pretext to get that job done
[2:01:41.560 --> 2:01:44.040]  when the left wants to abort every child they can
[2:01:44.040 --> 2:01:47.440]  sexualize the ones that live and are just unfit
[2:01:48.480 --> 2:01:53.280]  to even clean toilet seats with their tongues
[2:01:53.280 --> 2:01:55.480]  but they're in charge of us and the establishment
[2:01:55.480 --> 2:01:57.800]  puts them in charge because the God of this world
[2:01:57.800 --> 2:02:02.240]  is a fallen entity that's time is running short.
[2:02:02.240 --> 2:02:05.640]  This time is slipping away and then it'll just be seasons
[2:02:05.640 --> 2:02:06.680]  of the abyss.
[2:02:07.560 --> 2:02:09.080]  All right, who's been holding the longest?
[2:02:09.080 --> 2:02:14.080]  That would be, I guess, Gabriel in Arizona.
[2:02:14.880 --> 2:02:17.000]  Thanks for holding, welcome.
[2:02:17.000 --> 2:02:17.840]  Hello.
[2:02:17.840 --> 2:02:19.000]  Hi.
[2:02:19.000 --> 2:02:21.960]  Hi, it's a real pleasure to get to say
[2:02:21.960 --> 2:02:23.200]  you're a great American Alan.
[2:02:23.200 --> 2:02:24.040]  Thank you, sir.
[2:02:24.040 --> 2:02:25.520]  I'm just trying to love what you did.
[2:02:25.520 --> 2:02:26.360]  Thank you, sir.
[2:02:27.720 --> 2:02:32.200]  I have a good story and a good warning for your listeners.
[2:02:32.200 --> 2:02:37.040]  I was a victim of a home invasion
[2:02:37.040 --> 2:02:41.600]  by an illegal street gang of immigrants.
[2:02:41.600 --> 2:02:43.560]  We'll put it that way.
[2:02:43.560 --> 2:02:47.880]  It was a assault rifle that saved my two year old's life
[2:02:47.880 --> 2:02:51.160]  and this happened in 2002 in Baton Rouge.
[2:02:51.160 --> 2:02:54.800]  As a matter of fact, I was interviewed on War Room
[2:02:54.800 --> 2:02:56.160]  about a year and a half ago.
[2:02:57.520 --> 2:03:00.960]  I need to let these people know that when I sat
[2:03:00.960 --> 2:03:02.200]  in the back of that police car
[2:03:02.200 --> 2:03:03.920]  before they took me downtown,
[2:03:04.960 --> 2:03:08.160]  there was three pages of call history.
[2:03:08.160 --> 2:03:12.320]  And those were calls of me calling about the threats
[2:03:12.320 --> 2:03:16.240]  of violence and the theft and everything that came
[2:03:16.240 --> 2:03:19.520]  with having a gang that's stealing drugs
[2:03:19.520 --> 2:03:22.120]  move into your neighborhood right next door to you.
[2:03:23.520 --> 2:03:24.880]  Three pages.
[2:03:25.960 --> 2:03:28.760]  The police weren't there, do you see?
[2:03:28.760 --> 2:03:31.520]  It still took them an hour to get to the house
[2:03:31.520 --> 2:03:32.480]  after the shooting.
[2:03:34.120 --> 2:03:36.440]  The police aren't gonna be there for you.
[2:03:36.440 --> 2:03:38.400]  And these people are gonna come and take your guns
[2:03:38.400 --> 2:03:41.440]  and your way of protecting your family.
[2:03:42.400 --> 2:03:44.800]  There is a big problem with America
[2:03:44.800 --> 2:03:47.120]  if people are gonna sit down and take that.
[2:03:47.120 --> 2:03:48.880]  Because I got news for these people that are suing.
[2:03:48.880 --> 2:03:50.000]  There's a lot of people out here.
[2:03:50.000 --> 2:03:52.320]  Are they gonna make black pipe illegal?
[2:03:52.320 --> 2:03:55.560]  Because you can make a 12 gauge out of black pipe.
[2:03:55.560 --> 2:03:58.760]  You can make black powder very easy,
[2:03:58.760 --> 2:04:00.920]  anybody who has any kind of chemistry.
[2:04:00.920 --> 2:04:02.400]  Sir, I remember you coming on the show.
[2:04:02.400 --> 2:04:04.360]  I forget your name, but give your name and number
[2:04:04.360 --> 2:04:05.720]  to the producer.
[2:04:05.720 --> 2:04:07.800]  And we should have you back on
[2:04:07.800 --> 2:04:09.440]  because the Second Amendment's under total attack.
[2:04:09.440 --> 2:04:10.520]  People been asleep.
[2:04:10.520 --> 2:04:12.360]  I'd like to have you on, replay the newscast,
[2:04:12.360 --> 2:04:13.840]  talk about what happened.
[2:04:13.840 --> 2:04:15.240]  Did they try to charge you?
[2:04:16.560 --> 2:04:18.400]  No, they did not charge me with,
[2:04:18.400 --> 2:04:19.840]  well, what they did charge me with
[2:04:19.840 --> 2:04:21.600]  is I ended up shutting their power down.
[2:04:21.600 --> 2:04:24.400]  It's a whole long story with the harassment and things.
[2:04:24.400 --> 2:04:28.840]  Because they had the music up so loud for like three hours
[2:04:28.840 --> 2:04:31.000]  and they called the police and they cut the phone line.
[2:04:31.000 --> 2:04:32.200]  It's a whole long story,
[2:04:32.200 --> 2:04:35.320]  but they charged me with a criminal mischief
[2:04:35.320 --> 2:04:38.360]  that they dropped a couple days later
[2:04:38.360 --> 2:04:40.680]  when they agreed that I couldn't go home
[2:04:40.680 --> 2:04:42.360]  and I had to leave the area.
[2:04:42.360 --> 2:04:43.200]  So I mean-
[2:04:43.200 --> 2:04:44.080]  All right, all right, God bless you.
[2:04:44.080 --> 2:04:45.880]  Well, we'll check into that, thank you.
[2:04:45.880 --> 2:04:47.400]  Absolutely, folks.
[2:04:47.400 --> 2:04:49.800]  Mexico has a crime rate 10 times higher.
[2:04:49.800 --> 2:04:54.800]  No guns for the citizens, only the criminals are armed.
[2:04:54.960 --> 2:04:57.360]  InfoWarsLife has done it again
[2:04:57.360 --> 2:05:00.360]  with undoubtedly our biggest breakthrough yet.
[2:05:00.360 --> 2:05:04.400]  Super silver whitening toothpaste.
[2:05:04.400 --> 2:05:05.880]  This is proprietary.
[2:05:05.880 --> 2:05:08.160]  This is with the top lab in the country
[2:05:08.160 --> 2:05:10.680]  and it is incredibly high quality.
[2:05:10.680 --> 2:05:13.840]  This is the best toothpaste you're going to find.
[2:05:13.840 --> 2:05:15.600]  It's called whitening toothpaste,
[2:05:15.600 --> 2:05:17.560]  but really it knocks out the bacteria,
[2:05:17.560 --> 2:05:19.200]  it recalcifies the teeth,
[2:05:19.200 --> 2:05:22.200]  it does so many things on so many fronts.
[2:05:22.200 --> 2:05:25.920]  These beautiful tubes of super silver toothpaste
[2:05:25.920 --> 2:05:28.040]  are available at an introductory price
[2:05:28.040 --> 2:05:31.000]  of 25% off out of the gates as low as we can go
[2:05:31.000 --> 2:05:34.000]  and they're going to sell out very, very quickly.
[2:05:34.000 --> 2:05:37.280]  Super silver whitening toothpaste is going to be a hit.
[2:05:37.280 --> 2:05:39.280]  I'm very, very proud of it.
[2:05:39.280 --> 2:05:41.520]  I want to thank my father, a retired dentist
[2:05:41.520 --> 2:05:44.640]  for spearheading this the last two years and developing it.
[2:05:44.640 --> 2:05:47.800]  It's 25% off out of the gates that's as low as we can go
[2:05:47.800 --> 2:05:50.240]  because it's very, very expensive to produce.
[2:05:50.240 --> 2:05:53.240]  Get yours today at impollwarslife.com.
[2:05:56.400 --> 2:06:01.400]  All right, founder of Oath Keepers
[2:06:06.200 --> 2:06:08.200]  and he's also been a practicing constitutional lawyer.
[2:06:08.200 --> 2:06:10.800]  He's the only one practicing as he's busy fighting
[2:06:10.800 --> 2:06:11.760]  of the political battles.
[2:06:11.760 --> 2:06:13.760]  Stuart Rhodes is going to be in studio with us
[2:06:13.760 --> 2:06:15.360]  and then we're going to be joined by Michael Graves,
[2:06:15.360 --> 2:06:17.080]  former lead singer of the Misfits
[2:06:17.080 --> 2:06:18.880]  to get into the Luciferianism, the occultism.
[2:06:18.880 --> 2:06:20.640]  It just permeates rock and roll
[2:06:20.640 --> 2:06:22.160]  and how it's force-fed.
[2:06:22.160 --> 2:06:25.280]  The Supreme Court ruled in a devastating ruling
[2:06:25.280 --> 2:06:27.520]  against the Second Amendment and commerce
[2:06:27.520 --> 2:06:30.080]  that third parties can even steal guns,
[2:06:31.320 --> 2:06:35.840]  use them in crimes and that gun manufacturers are liable.
[2:06:35.840 --> 2:06:37.280]  This will shut down so much.
[2:06:37.280 --> 2:06:39.400]  That's why it's impossible to do business in this country.
[2:06:39.400 --> 2:06:40.960]  It's all part of the economic sabotage
[2:06:40.960 --> 2:06:43.120]  that Trump and others have been trying to fight.
[2:06:43.120 --> 2:06:44.480]  We're getting Stuart in here in just a moment,
[2:06:44.480 --> 2:06:46.600]  but first I wanted to have this important message,
[2:06:46.600 --> 2:06:49.120]  this flashback from last week
[2:06:49.120 --> 2:06:51.200]  when Robert Barnes was in studio
[2:06:51.200 --> 2:06:53.320]  talking about this important information
[2:06:53.320 --> 2:06:56.680]  because it's central to fund this operation
[2:06:56.680 --> 2:06:58.760]  while taking care of yourself.
[2:06:58.760 --> 2:07:00.760]  You see riots and stabbings and killings
[2:07:00.760 --> 2:07:04.560]  over Popeyes sandwiches, chicken sandwiches
[2:07:04.560 --> 2:07:06.240]  that tastes like crap, I think.
[2:07:07.320 --> 2:07:09.840]  Well, what would people do to boost their cognitive ability?
[2:07:09.840 --> 2:07:11.680]  What would they do to have a healthier body?
[2:07:11.680 --> 2:07:14.680]  What would they do to have the good halogen X2
[2:07:14.680 --> 2:07:15.520]  instead of the bad halogen?
[2:07:15.520 --> 2:07:16.480]  That's the real stuff.
[2:07:16.480 --> 2:07:18.280]  People shouldn't be in riots over,
[2:07:18.280 --> 2:07:20.480]  but see the real stuff that'll change your life,
[2:07:20.480 --> 2:07:25.240]  it's like, eh, I'd rather have some GMO garbage sandwich.
[2:07:25.240 --> 2:07:27.080]  That's what the corporate system sells
[2:07:27.080 --> 2:07:29.800]  is a bunch of stupid people
[2:07:29.800 --> 2:07:33.600]  literally killing each other over MSG-filled,
[2:07:33.600 --> 2:07:35.360]  processed chicken parts
[2:07:35.360 --> 2:07:39.120]  instead of all the products at m4slife.com.
[2:07:39.120 --> 2:07:48.560]  I said, you might have plugged last hour,
[2:07:48.560 --> 2:07:49.400]  I need to really plug.
[2:07:49.400 --> 2:07:51.160]  You said, well, can I plug?
[2:07:51.160 --> 2:07:53.120]  Can I talk about one of your products?
[2:07:53.120 --> 2:07:54.400]  You said that was a,
[2:07:54.400 --> 2:07:55.880]  I think there's a bottle of it in here.
[2:07:55.880 --> 2:07:58.920]  That's Brainforce Plus, our new truck.
[2:07:58.920 --> 2:07:59.960]  If they bring us a bottle,
[2:07:59.960 --> 2:08:01.280]  put it over there in my office right there, guys.
[2:08:01.280 --> 2:08:02.800]  Please bring me a bottle of that.
[2:08:02.800 --> 2:08:04.520]  And you asked me, what's in it
[2:08:04.520 --> 2:08:05.560]  and why is it so strong?
[2:08:05.560 --> 2:08:06.560]  Why do you like it?
[2:08:06.560 --> 2:08:08.200]  Yeah, so the, I mean, as a general rule,
[2:08:08.200 --> 2:08:10.440]  I have not used supplements over most of my life.
[2:08:10.440 --> 2:08:13.040]  I hasn't had much effect on my body chemistry.
[2:08:13.040 --> 2:08:15.520]  It's just the way my brain is organized.
[2:08:15.520 --> 2:08:17.680]  But the, I decided to try some of the products
[2:08:17.680 --> 2:08:19.760]  and just curious and see what they were like.
[2:08:19.760 --> 2:08:21.520]  And so I tried Brainforce Plus
[2:08:21.520 --> 2:08:23.920]  because it had sort of energy and focus components.
[2:08:23.920 --> 2:08:25.440]  And there were things I used in law school
[2:08:25.440 --> 2:08:27.120]  that were really effective.
[2:08:27.120 --> 2:08:27.960]  They later banned them
[2:08:27.960 --> 2:08:30.000]  because apparently they were too effective.
[2:08:30.000 --> 2:08:33.280]  The, that I found very to help create acute abilities
[2:08:33.280 --> 2:08:35.560]  to focus at key time periods
[2:08:35.560 --> 2:08:38.760]  without requiring much sleep as a lawyer you occasionally have
[2:08:38.760 --> 2:08:40.400]  when you have trials that happens,
[2:08:40.400 --> 2:08:42.360]  when you have certain oral arguments that happens,
[2:08:42.360 --> 2:08:44.280]  certain preparation that happens.
[2:08:44.280 --> 2:08:45.120]  So I was trying to find something
[2:08:45.120 --> 2:08:46.120]  that could replicate that
[2:08:46.120 --> 2:08:48.040]  and been unsuccessful doing so.
[2:08:48.040 --> 2:08:50.400]  So I thought, well, I'll try Brainforce Plus, see if it works.
[2:08:50.400 --> 2:08:52.280]  I took it and did, forgot I'd taken it.
[2:08:52.280 --> 2:08:55.440]  And about 12 hours later, I was sitting in my movie room.
[2:08:55.440 --> 2:08:57.320]  I was like, why is my brain like completely buzzing?
[2:08:57.320 --> 2:08:58.640]  Still boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
[2:08:58.640 --> 2:09:01.200]  at sort of peak activity, peak mindset.
[2:09:01.200 --> 2:09:02.560]  And then realized, oh, I took it.
[2:09:02.560 --> 2:09:04.640]  And I was like, wow, and it works fantastically.
[2:09:04.640 --> 2:09:06.200]  Now I take it every single day.
[2:09:06.200 --> 2:09:07.600]  And so, yeah, that's what I was curious about.
[2:09:07.600 --> 2:09:09.280]  What is it that goes into it
[2:09:09.280 --> 2:09:10.760]  that gives it that capability
[2:09:10.760 --> 2:09:12.560]  that no other product that I've tried
[2:09:12.560 --> 2:09:14.520]  has had that same success?
[2:09:14.520 --> 2:09:17.080]  And Robert, that's what's really central to this
[2:09:17.080 --> 2:09:18.960]  is that all of these ingredients
[2:09:18.960 --> 2:09:21.080]  are sourced for potency and quality,
[2:09:21.080 --> 2:09:24.440]  but that are known to synergistically work together
[2:09:24.440 --> 2:09:26.600]  to deliver these components to the brain
[2:09:26.600 --> 2:09:29.720]  in a way that these individual items cannot do.
[2:09:29.720 --> 2:09:33.360]  That's why Brainforce Plus is so important.
[2:09:33.360 --> 2:09:35.040]  And why people like you have noticed,
[2:09:35.040 --> 2:09:37.280]  it works better than almost any other product out there,
[2:09:37.280 --> 2:09:38.360]  certainly for the price.
[2:09:38.360 --> 2:09:40.240]  Here are some of the powerful ingredients
[2:09:40.240 --> 2:09:42.200]  behind Brainforce Plus.
[2:09:42.200 --> 2:09:44.160]  Bacopa herb extract.
[2:09:44.160 --> 2:09:47.200]  Traditionally used as an important neurological tonic
[2:09:47.200 --> 2:09:50.360]  and cognitive enhancer in ayurvedic medicine.
[2:09:50.360 --> 2:09:52.640]  Yurba mate leaf powder extract.
[2:09:52.640 --> 2:09:54.560]  Yurba mate leaf powder extract
[2:09:54.560 --> 2:09:56.560]  contains natural amounts of caffeine.
[2:09:56.560 --> 2:10:00.800]  Yurba mate is also loaded with polyphenols like quercetin,
[2:10:00.800 --> 2:10:03.480]  as well as potassium, magnesium, and manganese.
[2:10:03.480 --> 2:10:04.840]  Phosphatidylserine.
[2:10:04.840 --> 2:10:06.760]  An important chemical that is responsible
[2:10:06.760 --> 2:10:09.160]  for a number of important functions within the body.
[2:10:09.160 --> 2:10:11.280]  Phosphatidylserine is particularly known
[2:10:11.280 --> 2:10:14.040]  for its maintenance of cell structure in the brain.
[2:10:14.040 --> 2:10:15.600]  L-theanine is an amino acid
[2:10:15.600 --> 2:10:18.400]  that is one of the key components of green tea.
[2:10:18.400 --> 2:10:21.880]  L-theanine helps transmit nerve impulses to the brain.
[2:10:21.880 --> 2:10:25.120]  Vitamin B12, Vitamin B12 promotes energy and production
[2:10:25.120 --> 2:10:27.080]  through supporting the body's natural process
[2:10:27.080 --> 2:10:31.160]  of adrenal glands, red blood cell formation, and many others.
[2:10:31.160 --> 2:10:32.800]  Black pepper fruit extract,
[2:10:32.800 --> 2:10:34.880]  taken from the Piper nigrum fruit,
[2:10:34.880 --> 2:10:37.040]  black pepper has been used since antiquity
[2:10:37.040 --> 2:10:38.680]  as a form of traditional medicine
[2:10:38.680 --> 2:10:40.280]  and was chosen by our chemists
[2:10:40.280 --> 2:10:43.000]  to give Brainforce Plus an extra kick.
[2:10:43.000 --> 2:10:44.760]  But here's the bottom line.
[2:10:44.760 --> 2:10:47.720]  All these things synergistically together,
[2:10:47.720 --> 2:10:51.080]  turbocharged in a natural, healthy, good way.
[2:10:51.080 --> 2:10:53.440]  We could make a brain pill way stronger with stimulant.
[2:10:53.440 --> 2:10:54.360]  You're like, whoa, this is great.
[2:10:54.360 --> 2:10:55.720]  It doesn't work in two hours.
[2:10:55.720 --> 2:10:56.560]  You have a hangover.
[2:10:56.560 --> 2:10:58.280]  What folks like about Brainforce Plus
[2:10:58.280 --> 2:11:00.080]  is it doesn't do the hangover.
[2:11:00.080 --> 2:11:01.560]  So we went out and looked at some of the top formula.
[2:11:01.560 --> 2:11:03.720]  It's made it stronger, cut the price massively.
[2:11:03.720 --> 2:11:05.280]  It's still 50% off.
[2:11:05.280 --> 2:11:07.680]  Double Patriot points, free shipping on this.
[2:11:07.680 --> 2:11:09.480]  But this special is gonna have to end.
[2:11:09.480 --> 2:11:12.400]  1995, there's leading brands that are very similar
[2:11:12.400 --> 2:11:14.240]  that are sold for $60, $70,
[2:11:14.240 --> 2:11:16.520]  and they discount them, they're 30 bucks.
[2:11:16.520 --> 2:11:19.080]  That's because most people mark stuff up five to seven times.
[2:11:19.080 --> 2:11:21.600]  We only mark it up 150%.
[2:11:21.600 --> 2:11:23.840]  Then when we discount it, we're making like 50%.
[2:11:23.840 --> 2:11:24.680]  They sell a lot of it,
[2:11:24.680 --> 2:11:28.440]  but it does fund or operation in fullwarstore.com
[2:11:28.440 --> 2:11:31.280]  or triple A, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[2:11:31.280 --> 2:11:41.880]  And by the way, everything must go super sale.
[2:11:41.880 --> 2:11:44.400]  We'll end today, we're a week and a half over ending it.
[2:11:44.400 --> 2:11:46.560]  I've just been too busy to come up with a new sale.
[2:11:46.560 --> 2:11:48.000]  Plus this has been a giant sale
[2:11:48.000 --> 2:11:49.600]  and I'm having a look at what we can still have on sale.
[2:11:49.600 --> 2:11:51.480]  What we can't, store wide for shipping still,
[2:11:51.480 --> 2:11:53.400]  50% off on Brainforce Plus.
[2:11:53.400 --> 2:11:55.840]  So get yours right now and that funds the operation.
[2:11:55.840 --> 2:11:59.120]  Stuart Rhodes, founder of Oath Keepers,
[2:11:59.120 --> 2:12:02.360]  also has a law degree from Yale, won awards there.
[2:12:02.360 --> 2:12:03.600]  Nobody really practiced law now.
[2:12:03.600 --> 2:12:05.160]  He just fights with Oath Keepers
[2:12:05.160 --> 2:12:07.560]  to defend the first, the second, all of it.
[2:12:07.560 --> 2:12:09.720]  And I wanted to get him on today
[2:12:09.720 --> 2:12:11.080]  and that luckily he was in Texas
[2:12:11.080 --> 2:12:13.200]  and drove a couple of hours to get here.
[2:12:13.200 --> 2:12:14.040]  So he's with us.
[2:12:14.040 --> 2:12:16.600]  Michael Graves is coming in at the bottom of the hour.
[2:12:16.600 --> 2:12:19.120]  So we're gonna go about a half hour to the next hour.
[2:12:19.120 --> 2:12:21.080]  Then Matt Bracken takes over
[2:12:21.080 --> 2:12:23.760]  in the great former Navy seal and patriot and author.
[2:12:23.760 --> 2:12:26.160]  But this is a globalist coup against America.
[2:12:26.160 --> 2:12:28.000]  Trump was our attempt to get the country back.
[2:12:28.000 --> 2:12:29.560]  Now they're counter-striking.
[2:12:29.560 --> 2:12:31.280]  The people don't realize the war is now.
[2:12:31.280 --> 2:12:33.760]  That was just our attempt to kick the globalist out.
[2:12:33.760 --> 2:12:37.440]  Now their counter-offensive is ongoing.
[2:12:37.440 --> 2:12:40.720]  Supreme Court, I've talked to three lawyers on the phone,
[2:12:40.720 --> 2:12:42.360]  one on air, that's four lawyers.
[2:12:42.360 --> 2:12:43.600]  Two of them are famous liberals.
[2:12:43.600 --> 2:12:45.360]  Norm Pattis is a liberal, not a leftist.
[2:12:45.360 --> 2:12:49.000]  He said, this guts companies protections
[2:12:49.000 --> 2:12:50.480]  where they can not just gun owners.
[2:12:50.480 --> 2:12:52.760]  This sets a precedent unheard of
[2:12:52.760 --> 2:12:54.920]  to be able to go after companies
[2:12:54.920 --> 2:12:57.360]  that manufacture something that is used as supposed to
[2:12:57.360 --> 2:12:58.320]  when they sell it.
[2:12:58.320 --> 2:12:59.400]  But if somebody misuses it,
[2:12:59.400 --> 2:13:02.560]  it even steals it like Adam Lanza did in Sandy Hook,
[2:13:02.560 --> 2:13:03.680]  that they're liable.
[2:13:03.680 --> 2:13:06.760]  And they've already bankrupted them with this five-year suit.
[2:13:06.760 --> 2:13:09.160]  The same Democrat party law firm, high level.
[2:13:10.240 --> 2:13:12.200]  Biggest in Connecticut is the same one suing me
[2:13:12.200 --> 2:13:13.920]  to get rid of the First Amendment.
[2:13:13.920 --> 2:13:17.120]  So this is very, very, very, very strategic
[2:13:17.120 --> 2:13:19.560]  and a very, very dangerous situation.
[2:13:19.560 --> 2:13:22.240]  There were three dissenters, Alito, Gorsuch,
[2:13:22.240 --> 2:13:25.960]  and of course, Clarence Thomas,
[2:13:25.960 --> 2:13:27.520]  they were all just stunned.
[2:13:27.520 --> 2:13:29.000]  This, I believe, is the blackmail
[2:13:29.000 --> 2:13:30.400]  going on with the threats
[2:13:30.400 --> 2:13:31.880]  and what we've already seen them do
[2:13:31.880 --> 2:13:34.680]  to the other Supreme Court justices.
[2:13:34.680 --> 2:13:36.600]  This is just unbelievable, Stuart.
[2:13:36.600 --> 2:13:38.280]  Yeah, they had dug their responsibility,
[2:13:38.280 --> 2:13:40.080]  kicked it back to the Connecticut Supreme Court,
[2:13:40.080 --> 2:13:42.600]  where I believe Remington will wind up losing
[2:13:42.600 --> 2:13:44.080]  because the Connecticut Supreme Court
[2:13:44.080 --> 2:13:47.200]  is pretty obviously interested in opening up
[2:13:47.200 --> 2:13:49.880]  their protections for, you know,
[2:13:49.880 --> 2:13:51.720]  if their manufacturing protection laws
[2:13:51.720 --> 2:13:53.920]  to being applied to marketing too,
[2:13:53.920 --> 2:13:56.240]  not just to actual manufacturing.
[2:13:56.240 --> 2:13:57.440]  And that's the marketing exception
[2:13:57.440 --> 2:14:01.680]  that was in the PLCAA that Congress left in place.
[2:14:01.680 --> 2:14:03.200]  And they're suing me with the same thing,
[2:14:03.200 --> 2:14:05.840]  saying that I, quote, knowingly,
[2:14:05.840 --> 2:14:07.920]  questioned Sandy Hook to make money, never made any money.
[2:14:07.920 --> 2:14:09.360]  It's just totally made up.
[2:14:09.360 --> 2:14:12.000]  But they're trying to say my speech is false marketing.
[2:14:12.000 --> 2:14:14.200]  My speech on the air when I cover subjects
[2:14:14.200 --> 2:14:15.840]  has nothing to do with the advertisements.
[2:14:15.840 --> 2:14:17.240]  The advertisements are for products.
[2:14:17.240 --> 2:14:18.280]  I'm very clear about those.
[2:14:18.280 --> 2:14:19.120]  Right.
[2:14:19.120 --> 2:14:20.440]  So, you know, unfortunately,
[2:14:20.440 --> 2:14:21.960]  Congress left a loophole in there
[2:14:21.960 --> 2:14:23.800]  that the lawyer is taking advantage of.
[2:14:23.800 --> 2:14:25.240]  This is the big lesson for all of us.
[2:14:25.240 --> 2:14:28.080]  You can't rely on the lawyers or the judges to save you.
[2:14:28.080 --> 2:14:29.400]  Supreme Court of the United States
[2:14:29.400 --> 2:14:30.760]  is not gonna come save us.
[2:14:32.440 --> 2:14:35.960]  I asked you, you're a smart guy in the law,
[2:14:35.960 --> 2:14:38.480]  not just in the school, the world, the veteran.
[2:14:38.480 --> 2:14:39.560]  Where are we now?
[2:14:39.560 --> 2:14:42.360]  And you said the coup's getting hotter.
[2:14:42.360 --> 2:14:43.760]  Well, the coup's more open now.
[2:14:43.760 --> 2:14:45.840]  I mean, you got a, you know, a child of weather,
[2:14:45.840 --> 2:14:48.160]  underground, terrorist, and raised by burning,
[2:14:48.160 --> 2:14:51.920]  dormant and Bill Ayers, now the DA of San Francisco.
[2:14:51.920 --> 2:14:54.320]  And he'll probably be the future governor of California.
[2:14:54.320 --> 2:14:56.080]  So they're, they're taking the mascot,
[2:14:56.080 --> 2:14:57.720]  becoming more openly Marxist
[2:14:57.720 --> 2:14:59.400]  and letting you know what their agenda is.
[2:14:59.400 --> 2:15:00.560]  But the, you know, the revelations
[2:15:00.560 --> 2:15:02.960]  by the whistleblowers lawyer saying this is a coup
[2:15:02.960 --> 2:15:05.280]  since 2017 tells you right there.
[2:15:05.280 --> 2:15:06.120]  It's what this is.
[2:15:06.120 --> 2:15:07.880]  It's a coup to stop Trump.
[2:15:07.880 --> 2:15:09.840]  He was a firewall that we threw up as a last,
[2:15:09.840 --> 2:15:13.000]  was last, you know, last effort to try to do this peacefully.
[2:15:13.000 --> 2:15:14.680]  We threw it up as a firewall
[2:15:14.680 --> 2:15:16.640]  and put it for Trump, put him in office,
[2:15:16.640 --> 2:15:17.800]  but they can't let that play out.
[2:15:17.800 --> 2:15:19.960]  They got to remove him through whatever means necessary.
[2:15:19.960 --> 2:15:21.520]  And they're about to use the 25th Amendment.
[2:15:21.520 --> 2:15:25.120]  He saw that where psychiatrists are now asking to testify
[2:15:25.120 --> 2:15:26.600]  in front of the, in front of the house.
[2:15:26.600 --> 2:15:29.080]  By the way, you're supposed to lose your license right away
[2:15:29.080 --> 2:15:31.560]  if you, under the Goldwater Rule,
[2:15:31.560 --> 2:15:33.920]  if you diagnose someone from afar.
[2:15:33.920 --> 2:15:35.480]  Right, they haven't even examined him
[2:15:35.480 --> 2:15:37.120]  and interviewed him or anything.
[2:15:37.120 --> 2:15:38.880]  It's just political warfare.
[2:15:38.880 --> 2:15:41.000]  But you know, let's just know that we've done all we can
[2:15:41.000 --> 2:15:43.600]  for abdicated in some ways from having any restraint
[2:15:43.600 --> 2:15:44.720]  once they do this.
[2:15:45.600 --> 2:15:47.320]  Well, they're going to stage terror attacks, though,
[2:15:47.320 --> 2:15:50.920]  to make any physical response look improper.
[2:15:50.920 --> 2:16:11.920]  Let's war game this when we come back.
[2:16:21.280 --> 2:16:24.800]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[2:16:24.800 --> 2:16:26.920]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago
[2:16:26.920 --> 2:16:28.760]  when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[2:16:28.760 --> 2:16:30.280]  I sued the IRS in one.
[2:16:30.280 --> 2:16:31.560]  I beat the IRS then,
[2:16:31.560 --> 2:16:33.240]  and I've been beating them ever since.
[2:16:33.240 --> 2:16:34.960]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement,
[2:16:34.960 --> 2:16:37.160]  and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems
[2:16:37.160 --> 2:16:38.760]  they thought might never be solved.
[2:16:38.760 --> 2:16:40.000]  I can help you too.
[2:16:40.000 --> 2:16:42.960]  If you owe taxes, you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[2:16:42.960 --> 2:16:45.160]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.

[2:16:53.400 --> 2:16:55.440]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[2:16:55.440 --> 2:16:57.320]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure,
[2:16:57.320 --> 2:17:00.800]  and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you,
[2:17:00.800 --> 2:17:02.320]  but the symptoms are there.
[2:17:02.320 --> 2:17:05.040]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes, and drops,
[2:17:05.040 --> 2:17:07.280]  poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat
[2:17:07.280 --> 2:17:09.280]  are just a few of these that can alert you
[2:17:09.280 --> 2:17:10.680]  that something is wrong.

[2:17:18.400 --> 2:17:20.640]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[2:17:20.640 --> 2:17:23.080]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look,
[2:17:23.080 --> 2:17:25.040]  and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[2:17:25.040 --> 2:17:27.200]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.

[2:17:54.520 --> 2:17:58.440]  As we witness the most disastrous geological activity
[2:17:58.440 --> 2:18:00.080]  in recorded history,
[2:18:00.080 --> 2:18:02.960]  the globalists are backed into a corner,
[2:18:02.960 --> 2:18:05.800]  and the leftists are pushing for civil war.
[2:18:05.800 --> 2:18:07.360]  Borders are being broken,
[2:18:07.360 --> 2:18:09.920]  and sovereignty is being challenged.
[2:18:09.920 --> 2:18:12.600]  The world is going to change,
[2:18:12.600 --> 2:18:15.680]  and how it changes will likely be decided
[2:18:15.680 --> 2:18:18.080]  by those who are prepared to stay strong
[2:18:18.080 --> 2:18:20.040]  when the system fails.
[2:18:20.040 --> 2:18:22.000]  The system is vulnerable,
[2:18:22.000 --> 2:18:24.720]  electricity could be gone in an instant,
[2:18:24.720 --> 2:18:28.360]  and grocery stores could be empty in three days.

[2:18:54.880 --> 2:18:57.040]  The Alex Jones Show.
[2:18:57.040 --> 2:19:00.200]  A few days ago, my 11-year-old daughter came to me,
[2:19:00.200 --> 2:19:02.280]  and she had her digital textbook.
[2:19:02.280 --> 2:19:05.280]  She said, dad, they're teaching us about the periodic table,
[2:19:05.280 --> 2:19:07.000]  and I clicked on iodine,
[2:19:07.000 --> 2:19:09.560]  and it says that two billion people have low IQs
[2:19:09.560 --> 2:19:11.960]  or mentally retarded on the planet Earth,
[2:19:11.960 --> 2:19:13.160]  because they didn't get enough iodine.
[2:19:13.160 --> 2:19:15.080]  That's what you say all the time,
[2:19:15.080 --> 2:19:17.320]  but I've heard people say you're crazy and it's not true,
[2:19:17.320 --> 2:19:20.080]  but dad, it's right here on the periodic table
[2:19:20.080 --> 2:19:22.440]  when I click it saying exactly what you said.
[2:19:22.440 --> 2:19:23.720]  And I said, I know, honey,
[2:19:23.720 --> 2:19:25.480]  that's why I have you take
[2:19:25.480 --> 2:19:28.200]  the high-quality, nutraceutical grade iodine,
[2:19:28.200 --> 2:19:30.880]  is because it's why you're so vibrant,
[2:19:30.880 --> 2:19:31.720]  it's why you're so alive.
[2:19:31.720 --> 2:19:34.440]  It's one of the reasons
[2:19:34.440 --> 2:19:36.560]  that you're so much healthier and smarter
[2:19:36.560 --> 2:19:38.120]  than most other kids your age.
[2:19:38.120 --> 2:19:40.160]  And it just really blew her away
[2:19:40.160 --> 2:19:41.960]  to read it there for herself,
[2:19:41.960 --> 2:19:45.360]  and to know that two billion people, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:19:45.360 --> 2:19:47.600]  two billion are mentally retarded
[2:19:47.600 --> 2:19:48.760]  on the face of the Earth right now
[2:19:48.760 --> 2:19:50.320]  because of iodine deficiency.
[2:19:50.320 --> 2:19:52.480]  Research it and find out for yourself now.
[2:19:52.480 --> 2:19:54.600]  Infowars.com.
[2:19:57.440 --> 2:20:00.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:20:00.480 --> 2:20:05.480]  The Alex Jones Show
[2:20:05.480 --> 2:20:09.480]  The Alex Jones Show
[2:20:09.480 --> 2:20:11.480]  The Alex Jones Show
[2:20:11.480 --> 2:20:15.480]  Congress 15 years ago passed a law,
[2:20:15.480 --> 2:20:18.480]  and in the law, they explained why they were giving...
[2:20:18.480 --> 2:20:21.480]  From the front lines of the Information War,
[2:20:21.480 --> 2:20:23.480]  it's Alex Jones.
[2:20:23.480 --> 2:20:26.480]  They explained why they were giving liability protection
[2:20:26.480 --> 2:20:30.480]  to the gun makers right here.
[2:20:30.480 --> 2:20:31.480]  We're going to go to that,
[2:20:31.480 --> 2:20:32.480]  and then to some more of your phone calls,
[2:20:32.480 --> 2:20:34.480]  then our guests is coming in.
[2:20:34.480 --> 2:20:36.480]  Stuart Rhodes will write shot gunweathers,
[2:20:36.480 --> 2:20:38.480]  but go over the original law,
[2:20:38.480 --> 2:20:40.480]  Protection of Lawful Commerce and Arms Act
[2:20:40.480 --> 2:20:42.480]  in the subsection right there.
[2:20:42.480 --> 2:20:45.480]  Yeah, Congress is right here with their purposes.
[2:20:45.480 --> 2:20:47.480]  They say here the liability actions commenced
[2:20:47.480 --> 2:20:49.480]  or contemplated by the federal government,
[2:20:49.480 --> 2:20:51.480]  states, municipalities, private interest groups,
[2:20:51.480 --> 2:20:54.480]  and others attempt to use the judicial branch
[2:20:54.480 --> 2:20:57.480]  to circumvent the legislative branch of government
[2:20:57.480 --> 2:20:59.480]  to regulate interstate and foreign commerce
[2:20:59.480 --> 2:21:01.480]  through judgments and judicial decrees,
[2:21:01.480 --> 2:21:04.480]  thereby threatening separations of powers doctrine
[2:21:04.480 --> 2:21:06.480]  and weakening the undermining
[2:21:06.480 --> 2:21:08.480]  important principles of federalism,
[2:21:08.480 --> 2:21:10.480]  state sovereignty, et cetera.
[2:21:10.480 --> 2:21:12.480]  The whole point was to protect gun manufacturers
[2:21:12.480 --> 2:21:14.480]  against exactly what they're talking about
[2:21:14.480 --> 2:21:16.480]  and in-run around the legislature
[2:21:16.480 --> 2:21:18.480]  instead of banning guns,
[2:21:18.480 --> 2:21:20.480]  they'll instead ban and manufacture through lawsuits.
[2:21:20.480 --> 2:21:22.480]  And I had Norm Pattis,
[2:21:22.480 --> 2:21:24.480]  a famous liberal lawyer, a criminal lawyer,
[2:21:24.480 --> 2:21:26.480]  a First Amendment lawyer,
[2:21:26.480 --> 2:21:28.480]  the same law firm suing me,
[2:21:28.480 --> 2:21:30.480]  the First Amendment,
[2:21:30.480 --> 2:21:32.480]  no one can believe they did this.
[2:21:32.480 --> 2:21:34.480]  They said it's so clear that it absolutely
[2:21:34.480 --> 2:21:36.480]  violates all these sections of law,
[2:21:36.480 --> 2:21:38.480]  federal versus state,
[2:21:38.480 --> 2:21:40.480]  that even leftist Supreme Courts
[2:21:40.480 --> 2:21:42.480]  wouldn't do this in the past.
[2:21:42.480 --> 2:21:44.480]  And no one knows how a Republican court did this.
[2:21:44.480 --> 2:21:46.480]  I mean, this has got to be blackmail,
[2:21:46.480 --> 2:21:48.480]  just like with the Obamacare.
[2:21:48.480 --> 2:21:50.480]  Well, they're definitely ducking their responsibility.
[2:21:50.480 --> 2:21:52.480]  They're leaving the
[2:21:52.480 --> 2:21:54.480]  gun manufacturers wide open
[2:21:54.480 --> 2:21:56.480]  to exactly what the law was intended to stop.
[2:21:56.480 --> 2:21:58.480]  And it's going to cost hysteria
[2:21:58.480 --> 2:22:00.480]  in the states in massive litigations, the point.
[2:22:00.480 --> 2:22:02.480]  So why would a conservative court
[2:22:02.480 --> 2:22:04.480]  give a giant
[2:22:04.480 --> 2:22:06.480]  open-season
[2:22:06.480 --> 2:22:08.480]  letter of mark to all the leftist
[2:22:08.480 --> 2:22:10.480]  anti-gun lawyers? That's what they did.
[2:22:10.480 --> 2:22:12.480]  Open season.
[2:22:12.480 --> 2:22:14.480]  Right. Just remove the entire point of that federal law.
[2:22:14.480 --> 2:22:16.480]  So they allow for backdoor gun banning.
[2:22:16.480 --> 2:22:18.480]  The manufacturers will be afraid
[2:22:18.480 --> 2:22:20.480]  to market
[2:22:20.480 --> 2:22:22.480]  AR-15s any longer
[2:22:22.480 --> 2:22:24.480]  once Remington
[2:22:24.480 --> 2:22:26.480]  has a judgment. And notice they picked one gun
[2:22:26.480 --> 2:22:28.480]  like they picked Remington.
[2:22:28.480 --> 2:22:30.480]  Or they picked Alex Jones.
[2:22:30.480 --> 2:22:32.480]  And then once they've done that, they go after everybody.
[2:22:32.480 --> 2:22:34.480]  That's the plan, is they take out
[2:22:34.480 --> 2:22:36.480]  the one big one and everything else
[2:22:36.480 --> 2:22:38.480]  false. Sure. They go after the AR-15 first
[2:22:38.480 --> 2:22:40.480]  and after that, it'll be handguns.
[2:22:40.480 --> 2:22:42.480]  Then it'll be sniper rifles, quote-unquote.
[2:22:42.480 --> 2:22:44.480]  Then it'll be shotguns.
[2:22:44.480 --> 2:22:46.480]  All of these are dangerous weapons.
[2:22:46.480 --> 2:22:48.480]  But the
[2:22:48.480 --> 2:22:50.480]  underpinning argument is that the
[2:22:50.480 --> 2:22:52.480]  AR-15 is a weapon of war
[2:22:52.480 --> 2:22:54.480]  that shouldn't be marketed to the civilian population.
[2:22:54.480 --> 2:22:56.480]  And we have to say in response to that
[2:22:56.480 --> 2:22:58.480]  that yes, it's a weapon of war. It's exactly
[2:22:58.480 --> 2:23:00.480]  what the founding fathers intended to be in our hands.
[2:23:00.480 --> 2:23:02.480]  That's the whole point of the Second Amendment.
[2:23:02.480 --> 2:23:04.480]  There's a clear escalation of everything.
[2:23:04.480 --> 2:23:06.480]  I want to play Louis Gomer two weeks ago
[2:23:06.480 --> 2:23:08.480]  explaining that
[2:23:08.480 --> 2:23:10.480]  shooting comes at the end of a civil war
[2:23:10.480 --> 2:23:12.480]  and we're already in one and these people are pushing.
[2:23:12.480 --> 2:23:14.480]  Folks, they want a physical
[2:23:14.480 --> 2:23:16.480]  confrontation. Here it is.
[2:23:18.480 --> 2:23:20.480]  And it's about to push this country
[2:23:20.480 --> 2:23:22.480]  to a civil war if they were
[2:23:22.480 --> 2:23:24.480]  to get their wishes.
[2:23:24.480 --> 2:23:26.480]  And if there's one thing
[2:23:26.480 --> 2:23:28.480]  I don't want to see in my lifetime,
[2:23:28.480 --> 2:23:30.480]  I don't want to ever
[2:23:30.480 --> 2:23:32.480]  have participation in. It's a civil war.
[2:23:34.480 --> 2:23:36.480]  Some historian,
[2:23:36.480 --> 2:23:38.480]  I don't remember who,
[2:23:38.480 --> 2:23:40.480]  said guns
[2:23:40.480 --> 2:23:42.480]  are only involved in the last phase
[2:23:42.480 --> 2:23:44.480]  of a war.
[2:23:44.480 --> 2:23:46.480]  What's gone on here
[2:23:46.480 --> 2:23:48.480]  has not protected the Constitution.
[2:23:48.480 --> 2:23:50.480]  It's not protected
[2:23:50.480 --> 2:23:52.480]  the institutions.
[2:23:52.480 --> 2:23:54.480]  It's not protected
[2:23:54.480 --> 2:23:56.480]  this little experiment in self-government.
[2:23:56.480 --> 2:23:58.480]  Know what it has done, has put it
[2:23:58.480 --> 2:24:00.480]  all at risk.
[2:24:00.480 --> 2:24:02.480]  And they're systematically
[2:24:02.480 --> 2:24:04.480]  admit they want to get rid of the First Amendment
[2:24:04.480 --> 2:24:06.480]  and they want to get rid of the Second Amendment. It's here.
[2:24:06.480 --> 2:24:08.480]  Right. And now with the open
[2:24:08.480 --> 2:24:10.480]  coup against the president being wide open,
[2:24:10.480 --> 2:24:12.480]  it's obvious
[2:24:12.480 --> 2:24:14.480]  that their intention is to overthrow
[2:24:14.480 --> 2:24:16.480]  the U.S. and the U.S. system of government
[2:24:16.480 --> 2:24:18.480]  and to overthrow and overturn the election.
[2:24:18.480 --> 2:24:20.480]  And so I think he's right. He's being honest.
[2:24:20.480 --> 2:24:22.480]  He's being an honest legislator
[2:24:22.480 --> 2:24:24.480]  and warning them about where we're at.
[2:24:24.480 --> 2:24:26.480]  I've had the same thing gotten hot water for it
[2:24:26.480 --> 2:24:28.480]  and you've done the same thing.
[2:24:28.480 --> 2:24:30.480]  Well, they're the ones.
[2:24:30.480 --> 2:24:32.480]  They didn't just elect as the DA in San Francisco,
[2:24:32.480 --> 2:24:34.480]  the weatherman baby,
[2:24:34.480 --> 2:24:36.480]  the red diaper doper baby,
[2:24:36.480 --> 2:24:38.480]  as Savage would call them,
[2:24:38.480 --> 2:24:40.480]  Obama came out of that.
[2:24:40.480 --> 2:24:42.480]  And that's their blueprint and people that infiltrated
[2:24:42.480 --> 2:24:44.480]  Larry Grathwald and others.
[2:24:44.480 --> 2:24:46.480]  And it came out in court.
[2:24:46.480 --> 2:24:48.480]  We were planning 50 million of us in camps,
[2:24:48.480 --> 2:24:50.480]  25 million of us to be killed.
[2:24:50.480 --> 2:24:52.480]  Back when America had was 200 million people.
[2:24:52.480 --> 2:24:54.480]  And this was all Ph.D.'s
[2:24:54.480 --> 2:24:56.480]  Columbia, Stanford, Harvard
[2:24:56.480 --> 2:24:58.480]  sitting around in rooms planning
[2:24:58.480 --> 2:25:00.480]  executing everybody, okay, putting us in slave camps.
[2:25:00.480 --> 2:25:02.480]  And
[2:25:02.480 --> 2:25:04.480]  that's who the big banks are funding.
[2:25:04.480 --> 2:25:06.480]  That's who Soros wants.
[2:25:06.480 --> 2:25:08.480]  These people are literally a terrorist group.
[2:25:08.480 --> 2:25:10.480]  Well, I went to Yale Law School
[2:25:10.480 --> 2:25:12.480]  and I saw there in person
[2:25:12.480 --> 2:25:14.480]  that most of the elites at the top of that level
[2:25:14.480 --> 2:25:16.480]  are died in the wool Marxist.
[2:25:16.480 --> 2:25:18.480]  But now they're coming out of the closet
[2:25:18.480 --> 2:25:20.480]  and they're being much more open about it
[2:25:20.480 --> 2:25:22.480]  and which I think is good because it helps us
[2:25:22.480 --> 2:25:24.480]  to wake up our fellow Americans.
[2:25:24.480 --> 2:25:26.480]  Too many are asleep still.
[2:25:26.480 --> 2:25:28.480]  They're going to stage false lines
[2:25:28.480 --> 2:25:30.480]  like they activated Antifa in Texas in Ohio.
[2:25:30.480 --> 2:25:32.480]  They covered up successfully.
[2:25:32.480 --> 2:25:34.480]  The Texas Skybing Antifa, they took it down
[2:25:34.480 --> 2:25:36.480]  and put up that he was a conservative.
[2:25:36.480 --> 2:25:38.480]  He was Antifa as well, just like the guy in Ohio.
[2:25:38.480 --> 2:25:40.480]  They've got them ready.
[2:25:40.480 --> 2:25:42.480]  They're going on loan missions
[2:25:42.480 --> 2:25:44.480]  to give themselves up to get the guns
[2:25:44.480 --> 2:25:46.480]  as shock troops right up front.
[2:25:46.480 --> 2:25:48.480]  And it's coming.
[2:25:48.480 --> 2:25:50.480]  It's unbelievable.
[2:25:50.480 --> 2:25:52.480]  And by electing that,
[2:25:52.480 --> 2:25:54.480]  like you said, the diaper baby of the weather underground
[2:25:54.480 --> 2:25:56.480]  putting him in a position of leadership in California
[2:25:56.480 --> 2:25:58.480]  that sends, that's a huge dog whistle
[2:25:58.480 --> 2:26:00.480]  to all the radical leftists, Antifa and the streets.
[2:26:00.480 --> 2:26:02.480]  It says attack whoever you want
[2:26:02.480 --> 2:26:04.480]  and you're not going to get in trouble.
[2:26:04.480 --> 2:26:06.480]  He says you're going to let criminals out of jail.
[2:26:06.480 --> 2:26:08.480]  Right. So the more they do this,
[2:26:08.480 --> 2:26:10.480]  the more the radical left base
[2:26:10.480 --> 2:26:12.480]  is going to become more violent
[2:26:12.480 --> 2:26:14.480]  because they can see that the tide is turning
[2:26:14.480 --> 2:26:16.480]  in their favor. That's the perception.
[2:26:16.480 --> 2:26:18.480]  Well, obviously a conservative would never go
[2:26:18.480 --> 2:26:20.480]  on a Walmart and shoot innocent white, black, Hispanic people.
[2:26:20.480 --> 2:26:22.480]  Nobody would go in a nightclub and do it.
[2:26:22.480 --> 2:26:24.480]  That's all Antifa devil worshipers.
[2:26:24.480 --> 2:26:26.480]  That's like Adam Lanza.
[2:26:26.480 --> 2:26:28.480]  They're always Prozac head devil worshipers, you know, types.
[2:26:28.480 --> 2:26:30.480]  Patriots and I'm not saying do this
[2:26:30.480 --> 2:26:32.480]  would go after
[2:26:32.480 --> 2:26:34.480]  globalist and people.
[2:26:34.480 --> 2:26:36.480]  So just notice when the terror attacks come,
[2:26:36.480 --> 2:26:38.480]  they already have, they're going to be innocent people
[2:26:38.480 --> 2:26:40.480]  and it's not us. This is being staged.
[2:26:40.480 --> 2:26:42.480]  Yes.
[2:26:42.480 --> 2:26:44.480]  It's incredible how they covered up
[2:26:44.480 --> 2:26:46.480]  the Texas attack that he was
[2:26:46.480 --> 2:26:48.480]  Antifa leftist and that was confirmed
[2:26:48.480 --> 2:26:50.480]  and they put up on his sites.
[2:26:50.480 --> 2:26:52.480]  That should be a criminal investigation. Who took that down?
[2:26:52.480 --> 2:26:54.480]  Who put that up? Who protected him?
[2:26:54.480 --> 2:26:56.480]  Your question.
[2:26:56.480 --> 2:26:58.480]  Don't know.
[2:26:58.480 --> 2:27:00.480]  Let's go to a phone call. We'll take a few more of them.
[2:27:00.480 --> 2:27:02.480]  Our next guest is going to come in and co-host with us
[2:27:02.480 --> 2:27:04.480]  and I've got a special report I'm going to air part of.
[2:27:04.480 --> 2:27:06.480]  Let's go ahead and go to Jeff in Colorado.
[2:27:06.480 --> 2:27:08.480]  Thanks for holding, sir. Go ahead.
[2:27:08.480 --> 2:27:10.480]  How are you doing? Good, brother.
[2:27:10.480 --> 2:27:12.480]  How do we save the Second Amendment?
[2:27:12.480 --> 2:27:14.480]  So that's what you called him up.
[2:27:14.480 --> 2:27:16.480]  Have you ever heard of Carl Miller?
[2:27:16.480 --> 2:27:18.480]  He was a Vietnam vet.
[2:27:18.480 --> 2:27:20.480]  He teaches about the Constitution. Yes.
[2:27:20.480 --> 2:27:22.480]  He has some videos.
[2:27:22.480 --> 2:27:24.480]  Anyway, one of them is about the writ
[2:27:24.480 --> 2:27:26.480]  of Quo Warrianto.
[2:27:26.480 --> 2:27:28.480]  Anybody who want any judge
[2:27:28.480 --> 2:27:30.480]  who tries to violate any
[2:27:30.480 --> 2:27:32.480]  rights that you have, the Second Amendment,
[2:27:32.480 --> 2:27:34.480]  any of them, anybody
[2:27:34.480 --> 2:27:36.480]  can file a writ of Quo Warrianto
[2:27:36.480 --> 2:27:38.480]  against that judge and anybody
[2:27:38.480 --> 2:27:40.480]  connected with them is trying
[2:27:40.480 --> 2:27:42.480]  to do that. Have you heard of this thing?
[2:27:42.480 --> 2:27:44.480]  No. They can
[2:27:44.480 --> 2:27:46.480]  judge shit from them and they can be charged
[2:27:46.480 --> 2:27:48.480]  with sedition. Who's going to do that?
[2:27:48.480 --> 2:27:50.480]  They filed a note to the Constitution.
[2:27:50.480 --> 2:27:52.480]  Sir, sir, let me point this out.
[2:27:52.480 --> 2:27:54.480]  I was totally in my right and so was Don Jr.
[2:27:54.480 --> 2:27:56.480]  to say who the whistleblower was
[2:27:56.480 --> 2:27:58.480]  and who an Obama administration official
[2:27:58.480 --> 2:28:00.480]  was that was on the stone jury.
[2:28:00.480 --> 2:28:02.480]  They were everywhere saying arrest me
[2:28:02.480 --> 2:28:04.480]  up until the point that all these constitutional lawyers said,
[2:28:04.480 --> 2:28:06.480]  no, he's totally authorized to.
[2:28:06.480 --> 2:28:08.480]  That's First Amendment. Then they backed off.
[2:28:08.480 --> 2:28:10.480]  But they're trying
[2:28:10.480 --> 2:28:12.480]  to force their criminal takeover
[2:28:12.480 --> 2:28:14.480]  and what Stewart's saying
[2:28:14.480 --> 2:28:16.480]  is they've still got the Justice Department.
[2:28:16.480 --> 2:28:18.480]  Where is the Inspector General report?
[2:28:18.480 --> 2:28:20.480]  Where are these damn indictments? I don't know.
[2:28:20.480 --> 2:28:22.480]  That's what I'm wondering about. I'm done waiting.
[2:28:22.480 --> 2:28:24.480]  I keep hearing the Q folks and I understand their arguments,
[2:28:24.480 --> 2:28:26.480]  but, you know, I want to see some results.
[2:28:26.480 --> 2:28:28.480]  There's been no prosecutions.
[2:28:28.480 --> 2:28:30.480]  Why wasn't Hillary indicted immediately
[2:28:30.480 --> 2:28:32.480]  upon Trump becoming president for her obvious
[2:28:32.480 --> 2:28:34.480]  violations of federal statutes
[2:28:34.480 --> 2:28:36.480]  for felonies?
[2:28:36.480 --> 2:28:38.480]  Well, that's just the indictments.
[2:28:38.480 --> 2:28:40.480]  The deep state's so deep that all these people close to Trump
[2:28:40.480 --> 2:28:42.480]  that helped him get elected banning, he believed banning.
[2:28:42.480 --> 2:28:44.480]  Banning opened the drawbridge
[2:28:44.480 --> 2:28:46.480]  and brought in Fiona Hill
[2:28:46.480 --> 2:28:48.480]  and McMaster and all of them
[2:28:48.480 --> 2:28:50.480]  totally double dealt to the president.
[2:28:50.480 --> 2:28:52.480]  So the president took that operating system?
[2:28:52.480 --> 2:29:21.480]  Yeah.
[2:29:22.480 --> 2:29:24.480]  Well, that's it for today.
[2:29:24.480 --> 2:29:53.480]  Thanks for watching.
[2:29:54.480 --> 2:29:56.480]  We'll see you next time.
[2:30:24.480 --> 2:30:26.480]  We'll see you next time.
[2:30:54.480 --> 2:30:56.480]  All of our bodies are different.
[2:30:56.480 --> 2:30:59.480]  All of our metabolic systems are diverse.
[2:30:59.480 --> 2:31:01.480]  Some of us are deficient in some things
[2:31:01.480 --> 2:31:03.480]  and not in others.
[2:31:03.480 --> 2:31:05.480]  There's a lot of factors that go into this,
[2:31:05.480 --> 2:31:07.480]  and I'm not telling you something that you don't know,
[2:31:07.480 --> 2:31:09.480]  but I'm here to tell you.
[2:31:09.480 --> 2:31:12.480]  Every time I commit and use
[2:31:12.480 --> 2:31:14.480]  the supplements that we sell
[2:31:14.480 --> 2:31:16.480]  on a religious basis,
[2:31:16.480 --> 2:31:18.480]  my life completely changes.
[2:31:18.480 --> 2:31:20.480]  I'm healthier. I have more energy.
[2:31:20.480 --> 2:31:22.480]  I lose weight. I look better.
[2:31:22.480 --> 2:31:24.480]  Everybody notices.
[2:31:24.480 --> 2:31:26.480]  Two months ago, I said on air,
[2:31:26.480 --> 2:31:28.480]  I am going to commit to take
[2:31:28.480 --> 2:31:30.480]  X2 bodies ultimate turmeric.
[2:31:30.480 --> 2:31:32.480]  I'm going to commit
[2:31:32.480 --> 2:31:34.480]  to flush my gut out with the gut fusion
[2:31:34.480 --> 2:31:36.480]  from M4's life.
[2:31:36.480 --> 2:31:38.480]  And when I take these products,
[2:31:38.480 --> 2:31:40.480]  the results are nothing less
[2:31:40.480 --> 2:31:42.480]  than miraculous.
[2:31:42.480 --> 2:31:44.480]  Well, one product that's amazing that I use,
[2:31:44.480 --> 2:31:46.480]  I don't talk enough about is
[2:31:46.480 --> 2:31:48.480]  gut fusion folks. Check it out.
[2:31:48.480 --> 2:31:50.480]  There's nothing else like it.
[2:31:50.480 --> 2:31:52.480]  Now the cells about to end.
[2:31:52.480 --> 2:31:54.480]  Got fusion in four store.com.
[2:31:54.480 --> 2:31:56.480]  The time has come to defy
[2:31:56.480 --> 2:31:58.480]  the thought police.
[2:31:58.480 --> 2:32:00.480]  They are banning hundreds
[2:32:00.480 --> 2:32:02.480]  and hundreds of symbols every year.
[2:32:02.480 --> 2:32:04.480]  They're waging war on communication
[2:32:04.480 --> 2:32:06.480]  itself as a Fabian
[2:32:06.480 --> 2:32:08.480]  socialist promise they would do
[2:32:08.480 --> 2:32:10.480]  more than 70 years ago from their command
[2:32:10.480 --> 2:32:12.480]  base in England.
[2:32:12.480 --> 2:32:14.480]  We've had Oxford come out and ban
[2:32:14.480 --> 2:32:16.480]  clapping. The ADL
[2:32:16.480 --> 2:32:18.480]  and others will literally bankrupt you,
[2:32:18.480 --> 2:32:20.480]  kick you out of college, destroy you,
[2:32:20.480 --> 2:32:22.480]  have you arrested in some areas.
[2:32:22.480 --> 2:32:24.480]  If you do the OK symbol
[2:32:24.480 --> 2:32:26.480]  that's the international sign language symbol for OK,
[2:32:26.480 --> 2:32:28.480]  they know what they're doing.
[2:32:28.480 --> 2:32:30.480]  These people are authoritarians
[2:32:30.480 --> 2:32:32.480]  and they're dangerous.
[2:32:32.480 --> 2:32:34.480]  And the answer to their attack on speech
[2:32:34.480 --> 2:32:36.480]  is to exercise it in their face.
[2:32:36.480 --> 2:32:38.480]  We have a it's OK to be OK
[2:32:38.480 --> 2:32:40.480]  politically incorrect ball cap.
[2:32:40.480 --> 2:32:42.480]  It's black and white, very nice as the OK symbol
[2:32:42.480 --> 2:32:44.480]  on it. It's a great way to start conversations.
[2:32:44.480 --> 2:32:46.480]  M4Wars.com is on the back.

[2:32:48.480 --> 2:32:50.480]  M4Wars.com and support free speech
[2:32:50.480 --> 2:32:52.480]  by supporting M4Wars while having a great
[2:32:52.480 --> 2:33:20.480]  hat.
[2:33:22.480 --> 2:33:24.480]  All right.
[2:33:24.480 --> 2:33:26.480]  We're going to air part of a special
[2:33:26.480 --> 2:33:28.480]  report. Watch
[2:33:28.480 --> 2:33:30.480]  Learn Who Solders Sold to Satan.
[2:33:30.480 --> 2:33:32.480]  And then
[2:33:32.480 --> 2:33:34.480]  founder wealth keepers Stuart Rhodes is going to
[2:33:34.480 --> 2:33:36.480]  keep riding shotgun with us and
[2:33:36.480 --> 2:33:38.480]  Mr. Graves, former
[2:33:38.480 --> 2:33:40.480]  frontman for the misfits
[2:33:40.480 --> 2:33:42.480]  is going to come in here and talk about the Luciferianism,
[2:33:42.480 --> 2:33:44.480]  the occultism and just the evil,
[2:33:44.480 --> 2:33:46.480]  the open, that affiliate we're going to get
[2:33:46.480 --> 2:33:48.480]  into all that will continue with your calls.
[2:33:48.480 --> 2:33:50.480]  Michael Graves coming up Matt
[2:33:50.480 --> 2:33:52.480]  Bracken with the last 30 minutes. We were talking
[2:33:52.480 --> 2:33:54.480]  about solutions during the break and that was
[2:33:54.480 --> 2:33:56.480]  actually in my stacks Stuart Rhodes.
[2:33:56.480 --> 2:33:58.480]  As gun owners look to nullify
[2:33:58.480 --> 2:34:00.480]  gun laws, sanctuary isn't just for
[2:34:00.480 --> 2:34:02.480]  immigrants. It's an M4Wars.com
[2:34:02.480 --> 2:34:04.480]  article and it gets into Virginia and New
[2:34:04.480 --> 2:34:06.480]  Mexico, other states that you were
[2:34:06.480 --> 2:34:08.480]  mentioning. And the fact
[2:34:08.480 --> 2:34:10.480]  that what we see is so illegitimate
[2:34:10.480 --> 2:34:12.480]  that this coup against the president and
[2:34:12.480 --> 2:34:14.480]  the way this is all being done is illegitimate
[2:34:14.480 --> 2:34:16.480]  and these are criminal Marxist
[2:34:16.480 --> 2:34:18.480]  ally with radical Islam
[2:34:18.480 --> 2:34:20.480]  funded by the megabanks. Publicly explain
[2:34:20.480 --> 2:34:22.480]  that pyramid. Exactly.
[2:34:22.480 --> 2:34:24.480]  It's the same thing that Matt Bracken has been pointing out for years
[2:34:24.480 --> 2:34:26.480]  myself as well.
[2:34:26.480 --> 2:34:28.480]  At the top is the globalist and then you've got
[2:34:28.480 --> 2:34:30.480]  leaf them. Their foot soldiers
[2:34:30.480 --> 2:34:32.480]  are the radical Marxist on one side
[2:34:32.480 --> 2:34:34.480]  and then the radical Islamist on the other.
[2:34:34.480 --> 2:34:36.480]  That's why you see a mass influx
[2:34:36.480 --> 2:34:38.480]  of Muslims in the
[2:34:38.480 --> 2:34:40.480]  United States along with into Europe
[2:34:40.480 --> 2:34:42.480]  and on the left side of it.
[2:34:42.480 --> 2:34:44.480]  That's why you see a large influx from
[2:34:44.480 --> 2:34:46.480]  Central and South America because the left
[2:34:46.480 --> 2:34:48.480]  party wants to use those
[2:34:48.480 --> 2:34:50.480]  undocumented immigrants, you know, illegal
[2:34:50.480 --> 2:34:52.480]  immigrants as their foot soldiers
[2:34:52.480 --> 2:34:54.480]  and as their voting base.
[2:34:54.480 --> 2:34:56.480]  And by the way folks, if you live
[2:34:56.480 --> 2:34:58.480]  most like Austin,
[2:34:58.480 --> 2:35:00.480]  you'd see a burqa once a year, five years
[2:35:00.480 --> 2:35:02.480]  ago. I see a burqa anywhere I go
[2:35:02.480 --> 2:35:04.480]  anytime, any restaurant.
[2:35:04.480 --> 2:35:06.480]  Women pulling their face mask up, eating
[2:35:06.480 --> 2:35:08.480]  like this,
[2:35:08.480 --> 2:35:10.480]  you know, just nobody's working. I can tell
[2:35:10.480 --> 2:35:12.480]  you that to the men night day, just
[2:35:12.480 --> 2:35:14.480]  whatever and it's all just being brought
[2:35:14.480 --> 2:35:16.480]  into the country. Just like Germany got caught
[2:35:16.480 --> 2:35:18.480]  with secret flights of Somalis in
[2:35:18.480 --> 2:35:20.480]  out of Africa a few weeks ago with video of
[2:35:20.480 --> 2:35:22.480]  that, thousands at one time.
[2:35:22.480 --> 2:35:24.480]  Under Obama that was going on. The U.N. was in
[2:35:24.480 --> 2:35:26.480]  control of our borders under the treaty.
[2:35:26.480 --> 2:35:28.480]  Trump got us out of that. Yeah, the Muslim
[2:35:28.480 --> 2:35:30.480]  Brotherhoods plugged right in. The Muslim
[2:35:30.480 --> 2:35:32.480]  Brotherhood and Hamas are plugged right in
[2:35:32.480 --> 2:35:34.480]  with the cartels and helped train them
[2:35:34.480 --> 2:35:36.480]  and they come up through the cartels
[2:35:36.480 --> 2:35:38.480]  through Mexico. And Fast and Furious was running
[2:35:38.480 --> 2:35:40.480]  guns not just to the cartels but to ISIS.
[2:35:40.480 --> 2:35:42.480]  Right, that's right. It's all connected
[2:35:42.480 --> 2:35:44.480]  and it's all designed to create
[2:35:44.480 --> 2:35:46.480]  instability and to create chaos
[2:35:46.480 --> 2:35:48.480]  that they capitalize on.
[2:35:48.480 --> 2:35:50.480]  All right, we've got
[2:35:50.480 --> 2:35:52.480]  loaded phone lines. I've got Michael Graves. I
[2:35:52.480 --> 2:35:54.480]  want to get in here as well. We'll be
[2:35:54.480 --> 2:35:56.480]  able to go to your calls. I'm going to hear part
[2:35:56.480 --> 2:35:58.480]  of this report because it lays it all out.
[2:35:58.480 --> 2:36:00.480]  This is just from back in late September
[2:36:00.480 --> 2:36:02.480]  a few months ago. But let's get a few more
[2:36:02.480 --> 2:36:04.480]  calls in right now.
[2:36:04.480 --> 2:36:06.480]  Let me see who's been holding longest here.
[2:36:06.480 --> 2:36:08.480]  That would be Chuck in Vegas. Chuck,
[2:36:08.480 --> 2:36:10.480]  thank you for calling. Thank you for holding. Go ahead.
[2:36:10.480 --> 2:36:12.480]  Hi Alex. Hi Stuart.
[2:36:12.480 --> 2:36:14.480]  Thanks. I wanted to
[2:36:14.480 --> 2:36:16.480]  talk about the Supreme Court
[2:36:16.480 --> 2:36:18.480]  ruling and the blowback that I
[2:36:18.480 --> 2:36:20.480]  see from it is that I don't understand
[2:36:20.480 --> 2:36:22.480]  how the pharmaceutical
[2:36:22.480 --> 2:36:24.480]  companies are going to be able to
[2:36:24.480 --> 2:36:26.480]  subvert this. They
[2:36:26.480 --> 2:36:28.480]  their products kill
[2:36:28.480 --> 2:36:30.480]  a plus or a more
[2:36:30.480 --> 2:36:32.480]  individuals than guns ever do.
[2:36:32.480 --> 2:36:34.480]  These globalists
[2:36:34.480 --> 2:36:36.480]  control different
[2:36:36.480 --> 2:36:38.480]  law firms and they control most
[2:36:38.480 --> 2:36:40.480]  the courts and so
[2:36:40.480 --> 2:36:42.480]  if you're the special law firm you're allowed
[2:36:42.480 --> 2:36:44.480]  to go take out certain groups like Alex Jones
[2:36:44.480 --> 2:36:46.480]  of the Second Amendment or Remington. Same
[2:36:46.480 --> 2:36:48.480]  law firm but
[2:36:48.480 --> 2:36:50.480]  they won't go after Big Pharma and a lot
[2:36:50.480 --> 2:36:52.480]  of Big Pharma even has liability protection
[2:36:52.480 --> 2:36:54.480]  like the vaccines but you hit the nail on the head.
[2:36:54.480 --> 2:36:56.480]  Notice that California has
[2:36:56.480 --> 2:36:58.480]  Prop 65 where
[2:36:58.480 --> 2:37:00.480]  there can't be as much lead in a product
[2:37:00.480 --> 2:37:02.480]  you sell there than there is in the air. It's impossible.
[2:37:02.480 --> 2:37:04.480]  But they
[2:37:04.480 --> 2:37:06.480]  don't fluoride the water that's deadly toxic
[2:37:06.480 --> 2:37:08.480]  and they admit it is. It's all selectively enforced.
[2:37:08.480 --> 2:37:10.480]  Right. So pharmaceutical companies
[2:37:10.480 --> 2:37:12.480]  will never be held to account for the shootings.
[2:37:12.480 --> 2:37:14.480]  Quite a few of these people in fact
[2:37:14.480 --> 2:37:16.480]  probably all of them have been on some kind of psychotropic drug
[2:37:16.480 --> 2:37:18.480]  but no one looks at the pharmaceutical
[2:37:18.480 --> 2:37:20.480]  companies. Congress is not looking at them
[2:37:20.480 --> 2:37:22.480]  no lawsuits against them for it.
[2:37:22.480 --> 2:37:24.480]  They're left there. When I was on Piers Morgan
[2:37:24.480 --> 2:37:26.480]  and said don't blame the Second Amendment. Every one of
[2:37:26.480 --> 2:37:28.480]  these shooters has been on serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[2:37:28.480 --> 2:37:30.480]  You just had an ad for it last break Piers
[2:37:30.480 --> 2:37:32.480]  cut me off right there. There you go.
[2:37:32.480 --> 2:37:34.480]  They're untouchable because they want that
[2:37:34.480 --> 2:37:36.480]  they want Americans drug down and dumb
[2:37:36.480 --> 2:37:38.480]  down and kept numb.
[2:37:38.480 --> 2:37:40.480]  It's a brave new world right. But we've got to
[2:37:40.480 --> 2:37:42.480]  expose it. You've got to expose it. That's a great
[2:37:42.480 --> 2:37:44.480]  point. Anything else Chuck.
[2:37:44.480 --> 2:37:46.480]  I'll I guess I'll wrap it up
[2:37:46.480 --> 2:37:48.480]  with the idea that I just wanted to
[2:37:48.480 --> 2:37:50.480]  compliment you on your
[2:37:50.480 --> 2:37:52.480]  your products. I've been using
[2:37:52.480 --> 2:37:54.480]  I've been using your supplements
[2:37:54.480 --> 2:37:56.480]  and your vitamins
[2:37:56.480 --> 2:37:58.480]  prior to you even making them
[2:37:58.480 --> 2:38:00.480]  when you had another company that you used to endorse
[2:38:00.480 --> 2:38:02.480]  to do it. So it's been a long time
[2:38:02.480 --> 2:38:04.480]  everything from extender wise
[2:38:04.480 --> 2:38:06.480]  real red bull
[2:38:06.480 --> 2:38:08.480]  DNA force, Anthroplex
[2:38:08.480 --> 2:38:10.480]  bodies and then I make a shake with
[2:38:10.480 --> 2:38:12.480]  the ultimate bone broth of
[2:38:12.480 --> 2:38:14.480]  vitamin fusion. It's
[2:38:14.480 --> 2:38:16.480]  all tremendous stuff.
[2:38:16.480 --> 2:38:18.480]  It's shocking to see though this
[2:38:18.480 --> 2:38:20.480]  Republican court do this the Second
[2:38:20.480 --> 2:38:22.480]  Amendment and that tells you the type of
[2:38:22.480 --> 2:38:24.480]  I guarantee it's blackmail.
[2:38:24.480 --> 2:38:26.480]  It's a
[2:38:26.480 --> 2:38:28.480]  it's a horrendous thing and
[2:38:28.480 --> 2:38:30.480]  be able to go after guns
[2:38:30.480 --> 2:38:32.480]  when you've again going back
[2:38:32.480 --> 2:38:34.480]  to pharmaceutical companies how much land
[2:38:34.480 --> 2:38:36.480]  was on serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[2:38:36.480 --> 2:38:38.480]  Yeah, I mean almost every single one of them
[2:38:38.480 --> 2:38:40.480]  when you look at a lot of these mass shootings they've all
[2:38:40.480 --> 2:38:42.480]  been on some type of psychotropic
[2:38:42.480 --> 2:38:44.480]  and as an insert saying it can make
[2:38:44.480 --> 2:38:46.480]  you kill people. That's right.
[2:38:46.480 --> 2:38:48.480]  We all your kids depressed. Let's give them
[2:38:48.480 --> 2:38:50.480]  something that can make him a maniac.
[2:38:50.480 --> 2:38:52.480]  One of those claimers may cause you to
[2:38:52.480 --> 2:38:54.480]  be almost subtle or suicidal.
[2:38:54.480 --> 2:38:56.480]  That's right. God bless you. Great points Chuck. Thanks for holding.
[2:38:56.480 --> 2:38:58.480]  We'll get to everybody else. But here's part
[2:38:58.480 --> 2:39:00.480]  of the report. It's like ten minutes long.
[2:39:00.480 --> 2:39:02.480]  It's a really important report of that. It reposted
[2:39:02.480 --> 2:39:04.480]  the front page of info wars dot com.
[2:39:04.480 --> 2:39:06.480]  Learn how and who
[2:39:06.480 --> 2:39:08.480]  sold their soul to Satan ladies and gentlemen.
[2:39:08.480 --> 2:39:10.480]  And again they're not just doing this as a joke.
[2:39:10.480 --> 2:39:12.480]  This is real. This is who they follow.
[2:39:12.480 --> 2:39:14.480]  Here's part of that report.
[2:39:14.480 --> 2:39:30.480]  Info wars dot com.
[2:39:30.480 --> 2:39:32.480]  Info wars. The most banned network
[2:39:32.480 --> 2:39:34.480]  in the world.
[2:39:34.480 --> 2:39:36.480]  There is a saying.
[2:39:36.480 --> 2:39:38.480]  No one knows who first claimed it.
[2:39:38.480 --> 2:39:40.480]  Spent around for thousands of years.
[2:39:40.480 --> 2:39:42.480]  But it goes like this.
[2:39:42.480 --> 2:39:44.480]  The devil's greatest trick
[2:39:44.480 --> 2:39:46.480]  was convincing the world
[2:39:46.480 --> 2:39:48.480]  that he doesn't exist.
[2:39:48.480 --> 2:39:50.480]  And if you go to public school
[2:39:50.480 --> 2:39:52.480]  or even most private schools
[2:39:52.480 --> 2:39:54.480]  or if you go to major
[2:39:54.480 --> 2:39:56.480]  university, you're taught
[2:39:56.480 --> 2:39:58.480]  there is no god. There is no devil.
[2:39:58.480 --> 2:40:00.480]  We're just machines.
[2:40:00.480 --> 2:40:02.480]  In fact we don't even
[2:40:02.480 --> 2:40:04.480]  have free will.
[2:40:04.480 --> 2:40:06.480]  But then I began to notice
[2:40:06.480 --> 2:40:08.480]  when I was going to college
[2:40:08.480 --> 2:40:10.480]  that a lot of the professors teaching
[2:40:10.480 --> 2:40:12.480]  that when I went and looked them up
[2:40:12.480 --> 2:40:14.480]  were actually into the occult.
[2:40:14.480 --> 2:40:16.480]  There's a lot of examples of this.
[2:40:16.480 --> 2:40:18.480]  But there was a professor at the University of Texas
[2:40:18.480 --> 2:40:20.480]  who was the head of the biology department
[2:40:20.480 --> 2:40:22.480]  Dr. Eric Pionka.
[2:40:22.480 --> 2:40:24.480]  And he said on his own website
[2:40:24.480 --> 2:40:26.480]  that he was a druid practitioner
[2:40:26.480 --> 2:40:28.480]  and believed in the occult.
[2:40:28.480 --> 2:40:30.480]  And was even on the UT website
[2:40:30.480 --> 2:40:32.480]  him dressed up as an occultist
[2:40:32.480 --> 2:40:34.480]  that's in my film In Game.
[2:40:34.480 --> 2:40:36.480]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[2:40:36.480 --> 2:40:38.480]  That made 12 years ago.
[2:40:38.480 --> 2:40:40.480]  He wants global depopulation.
[2:40:40.480 --> 2:40:42.480]  He thinks humans are inherently just bad.
[2:40:42.480 --> 2:40:44.480]  And he believes in the spirit world.
[2:40:44.480 --> 2:40:46.480]  But if you go back to what he was teaching class
[2:40:46.480 --> 2:40:48.480]  we're just machines. There is no god.
[2:40:48.480 --> 2:40:50.480]  There is no devil. The truth is
[2:40:50.480 --> 2:40:52.480]  examples of the establishment
[2:40:52.480 --> 2:40:54.480]  and the left's obsession with the occult
[2:40:54.480 --> 2:40:56.480]  and straight up devil worship
[2:40:56.480 --> 2:40:58.480]  is historically all over the place
[2:40:58.480 --> 2:41:00.480]  and happening now every day.
[2:41:00.480 --> 2:41:02.480]  In fact just this weekend in Portland
[2:41:02.480 --> 2:41:04.480]  Antifa had a city sponsored event
[2:41:04.480 --> 2:41:06.480]  that the mayor supports
[2:41:06.480 --> 2:41:08.480]  and did black magic rituals
[2:41:08.480 --> 2:41:10.480]  against the Patriot prayer march
[2:41:10.480 --> 2:41:12.480]  that's happened there the last few years
[2:41:12.480 --> 2:41:14.480]  trying to exercise it
[2:41:14.480 --> 2:41:16.480]  and keep it from even taking place in the city.
[2:41:16.480 --> 2:41:18.480]  If you agree with me
[2:41:18.480 --> 2:41:20.480]  If you agree
[2:41:20.480 --> 2:41:22.480]  repeat after me.
[2:41:22.480 --> 2:41:24.480]  Hail Satan!
[2:41:24.480 --> 2:41:26.480]  Hail Satan!
[2:41:26.480 --> 2:41:28.480]  Hail Satan!
[2:41:28.480 --> 2:41:30.480]  Hail Satan!
[2:41:30.480 --> 2:41:32.480]  Hail Satan!
[2:41:32.480 --> 2:41:34.480]  The French Revolution itself
[2:41:34.480 --> 2:41:36.480]  was occultic, Luciferian, satanic.
[2:41:36.480 --> 2:41:38.480]  It was the left hand
[2:41:38.480 --> 2:41:40.480]  path
[2:41:40.480 --> 2:41:42.480]  which means the sinister side
[2:41:42.480 --> 2:41:44.480]  following the devil.
[2:41:44.480 --> 2:41:46.480]  It didn't just want to overthrow the church
[2:41:46.480 --> 2:41:48.480]  and the royalty. It wanted to overthrow
[2:41:48.480 --> 2:41:50.480]  the family itself
[2:41:50.480 --> 2:41:52.480]  and it wanted to target children.
[2:41:52.480 --> 2:41:54.480]  If you go back thousands of years ago
[2:41:54.480 --> 2:41:56.480]  all across the Middle East, all across
[2:41:56.480 --> 2:41:58.480]  Africa, all across what's western Europe
[2:41:58.480 --> 2:42:00.480]  today or Mesoamerica
[2:42:00.480 --> 2:42:02.480]  human sacrifice of women
[2:42:02.480 --> 2:42:04.480]  and children, virgins
[2:42:04.480 --> 2:42:06.480]  demanded by these dark
[2:42:06.480 --> 2:42:08.480]  wicked gods.
[2:42:08.480 --> 2:42:10.480]  Bob Dylan, Katie Perry, Lady Gaga
[2:42:10.480 --> 2:42:12.480]  almost every quote
[2:42:12.480 --> 2:42:14.480]  pop or rock star
[2:42:14.480 --> 2:42:16.480]  that you see making the top of the charts
[2:42:16.480 --> 2:42:18.480]  will tell you they made a deal
[2:42:18.480 --> 2:42:20.480]  with the literal devil
[2:42:20.480 --> 2:42:22.480]  in this world for success.
[2:42:22.480 --> 2:42:24.480]  Well it goes back to the destiny thing
[2:42:24.480 --> 2:42:26.480]  and I made it to bargain with it
[2:42:26.480 --> 2:42:28.480]  you know
[2:42:28.480 --> 2:42:30.480]  a long time ago
[2:42:30.480 --> 2:42:32.480]  holding up my hand
[2:42:32.480 --> 2:42:34.480]  What was your bargain?
[2:42:34.480 --> 2:42:36.480]  To get where
[2:42:36.480 --> 2:42:38.480]  I am now
[2:42:38.480 --> 2:42:40.480]  Should I ask who you made the bargain with?
[2:42:40.480 --> 2:42:42.480]  With
[2:42:42.480 --> 2:42:44.480]  you know with the chief
[2:42:44.480 --> 2:43:12.480]  commander.
[2:43:14.480 --> 2:43:16.480]  I know honey, that's why
[2:43:16.480 --> 2:43:18.480]  I have you take the high quality
[2:43:18.480 --> 2:43:20.480]  nutraceutical grade iodine
[2:43:20.480 --> 2:43:22.480]  is because it's why you're so vibrant
[2:43:22.480 --> 2:43:24.480]  it's why you're so alive
[2:43:24.480 --> 2:43:26.480]  it's one of the reasons
[2:43:26.480 --> 2:43:28.480]  that you're so much healthier
[2:43:28.480 --> 2:43:30.480]  and smarter than most other kids your age
[2:43:30.480 --> 2:43:32.480]  and it just really blew her away
[2:43:32.480 --> 2:43:34.480]  to read it there for herself
[2:43:34.480 --> 2:43:36.480]  and to know that two billion
[2:43:36.480 --> 2:43:38.480]  people ladies and gentlemen
[2:43:38.480 --> 2:43:40.480]  two billion people
[2:43:40.480 --> 2:43:42.480]  two billion people
[2:43:42.480 --> 2:43:44.480]  ladies and gentlemen
[2:43:44.480 --> 2:43:46.480]  two billion are mentally retarded
[2:43:46.480 --> 2:43:48.480]  on the face of the earth right now
[2:43:48.480 --> 2:43:50.480]  because of iodine deficiency
[2:43:50.480 --> 2:43:52.480]  research it and find out for yourself now
[2:43:52.480 --> 2:43:54.480]  infowars.com
[2:43:54.480 --> 2:43:56.480]  Infowars life has done it again
[2:43:56.480 --> 2:43:58.480]  with undoubtedly our biggest
[2:43:58.480 --> 2:44:00.480]  breakthrough yet
[2:44:00.480 --> 2:44:02.480]  super silver whitening
[2:44:02.480 --> 2:44:04.480]  toothpaste
[2:44:04.480 --> 2:44:06.480]  this is proprietary
[2:44:06.480 --> 2:44:08.480]  this is with the top lab in the country
[2:44:08.480 --> 2:44:10.480]  and it is incredibly high quality
[2:44:10.480 --> 2:44:12.480]  toothpaste you're going to find
[2:44:12.480 --> 2:44:14.480]  it's called whitening toothpaste
[2:44:14.480 --> 2:44:16.480]  but really it knocks out the bacteria
[2:44:16.480 --> 2:44:18.480]  it recalcifies the teeth
[2:44:18.480 --> 2:44:20.480]  it does so many things on so many fronts
[2:44:20.480 --> 2:44:22.480]  these beautiful tubes
[2:44:22.480 --> 2:44:24.480]  of super silver toothpaste
[2:44:24.480 --> 2:44:26.480]  are available at an introductory price
[2:44:26.480 --> 2:44:28.480]  of 25% off out of the gates
[2:44:28.480 --> 2:44:30.480]  it's as low as we can go
[2:44:30.480 --> 2:44:32.480]  and they're going to sell out very very quickly
[2:44:32.480 --> 2:44:34.480]  super silver whitening
[2:44:34.480 --> 2:44:36.480]  toothpaste is going to be a hit
[2:44:36.480 --> 2:44:38.480]  I'm very very proud of it
[2:44:38.480 --> 2:44:40.480]  I want to thank my father a retired dentist
[2:44:40.480 --> 2:44:42.480]  for spearheading this
[2:44:42.480 --> 2:44:44.480]  the last two years and developing it
[2:44:44.480 --> 2:44:46.480]  it's 25% off out of the gates
[2:44:46.480 --> 2:44:48.480]  that's as low as we can go
[2:44:48.480 --> 2:44:50.480]  because it's very very expensive to produce
[2:44:50.480 --> 2:45:18.480]  at infohorselife.com
[2:45:20.480 --> 2:45:22.480]  many of them are asleep thinking
[2:45:22.480 --> 2:45:24.480]  2020 is in the bag
[2:45:24.480 --> 2:45:26.480]  ladies and gentlemen we just lost Kentucky
[2:45:26.480 --> 2:45:28.480]  we just lost the Virginia State House
[2:45:28.480 --> 2:45:30.480]  the first time in 30 years
[2:45:30.480 --> 2:45:32.480]  this is serious we can win
[2:45:32.480 --> 2:45:34.480]  again and secure the gains we've gotten
[2:45:34.480 --> 2:45:36.480]  or we can see it all washed down the drain
[2:45:36.480 --> 2:45:38.480]  whatever you do
[2:45:38.480 --> 2:45:40.480]  get more politically activated than you ever have
[2:45:40.480 --> 2:45:42.480]  and spread the live links at
[2:45:42.480 --> 2:45:44.480]  banddocvideo and infohorselife.com
[2:45:44.480 --> 2:45:46.480]  if you want to defeat the deep state and the globalist

[2:45:56.480 --> 2:45:58.480]  in FEMA region 6
[2:45:58.480 --> 2:46:00.480]  you're on the air worldwide Stacey
[2:46:00.480 --> 2:46:02.480]  good to talk to you
[2:46:02.480 --> 2:46:04.480]  before I get into what I want to say
[2:46:04.480 --> 2:46:06.480]  I just want to let you know that I don't normally take vitamins at all
[2:46:06.480 --> 2:46:08.480]  I was turned on to the ultimate female
[2:46:08.480 --> 2:46:10.480]  I looked at all the ingredients
[2:46:10.480 --> 2:46:12.480]  and they're all organic root
[2:46:12.480 --> 2:46:14.480]  things like that that I trust
[2:46:14.480 --> 2:46:16.480]  because I've seen a lot of other vitamins
[2:46:16.480 --> 2:46:18.480]  they don't have things that they say that they have in them
[2:46:18.480 --> 2:46:20.480]  and they're often not things that are natural
[2:46:20.480 --> 2:46:22.480]  I appreciate that
[2:46:22.480 --> 2:46:24.480]  well what happened with ultimate female force tell us about it
[2:46:24.480 --> 2:46:26.480]  well it's really great you know it's like a multivitamin
[2:46:26.480 --> 2:46:28.480]  I take it it tastes good it doesn't have that nasty aftertaste
[2:46:28.480 --> 2:46:30.480]  it actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste
[2:46:30.480 --> 2:46:32.480]  and you know it just gives me energy
[2:46:32.480 --> 2:46:34.480]  and fuels me throughout the day so I really like it
[2:46:34.480 --> 2:46:36.480]  well just so you know we look at whatever the best herbs are
[2:46:36.480 --> 2:46:38.480]  they're known to turbo charge women
[2:46:38.480 --> 2:46:40.480]  and then we get the organic ones and put it in it
[2:46:40.480 --> 2:46:42.480]  so yeah stamina
[2:46:42.480 --> 2:46:44.480]  so energy
[2:46:44.480 --> 2:46:46.480]  these are amazing things in ultimate female force
[2:46:46.480 --> 2:46:48.480]  so I'm glad you plugged it
[2:46:48.480 --> 2:46:50.480]  infowarstore.com
[2:46:50.480 --> 2:47:14.480]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:47:14.480 --> 2:47:20.480]  one bob jillen have to say about making a deal with somebody
[2:47:20.480 --> 2:47:22.480]  before he even got his supposed record contract
[2:47:22.480 --> 2:47:26.480]  well it goes back to the destiny theme
[2:47:26.480 --> 2:47:28.480]  and I made it to bargain with it
[2:47:28.480 --> 2:47:30.480]  you know a long time ago
[2:47:30.480 --> 2:47:34.480]  and I'm holding up my hand
[2:47:34.480 --> 2:47:36.480]  what was your bargain
[2:47:36.480 --> 2:47:38.480]  to get where I am now
[2:47:38.480 --> 2:47:42.480]  should I ask who you made the bargain with
[2:47:42.480 --> 2:47:46.480]  with you know with the chief commander
[2:47:46.480 --> 2:47:48.480]  on this earth
[2:47:48.480 --> 2:47:52.480]  and this earth and then in the world we can't see
[2:47:52.480 --> 2:47:56.480]  bob jillen told 60 minutes and other national tv programs that
[2:47:56.480 --> 2:47:58.480]  just give it to him
[2:47:58.480 --> 2:48:02.480]  so to be able to come up with the rhymes and the music
[2:48:02.480 --> 2:48:06.480]  that he developed and all of it went to the crossroads
[2:48:06.480 --> 2:48:10.480]  from the front lines of the information war
[2:48:10.480 --> 2:48:14.480]  alex jones
[2:48:14.480 --> 2:48:16.480]  and we are back ladies and gentlemen
[2:48:16.480 --> 2:48:18.480]  now again I remember
[2:48:18.480 --> 2:48:20.480]  people like Ted Gunnerson
[2:48:20.480 --> 2:48:22.480]  who had been a high level FBI agent
[2:48:22.480 --> 2:48:24.480]  and others
[2:48:24.480 --> 2:48:26.480]  general benton parton ahead of everyone's weapons development
[2:48:26.480 --> 2:48:28.480]  you know what's above the communist
[2:48:28.480 --> 2:48:30.480]  satanists and I thought well these are old christians
[2:48:30.480 --> 2:48:32.480]  I'm a christian too but really there's not satanists around
[2:48:32.480 --> 2:48:34.480]  everywhere I mean you see it in hollywood
[2:48:34.480 --> 2:48:36.480]  you see it in movies you see it around the world
[2:48:36.480 --> 2:48:38.480]  but they're not serious about it
[2:48:38.480 --> 2:48:40.480]  you know that's just bible thumping fear
[2:48:40.480 --> 2:48:42.480]  but no it's all real and now
[2:48:42.480 --> 2:48:44.480]  pedophilia is out in the open they're coming for your children
[2:48:44.480 --> 2:48:46.480]  a whistleblower's lawyer
[2:48:46.480 --> 2:48:48.480]  you know says he likes epstein
[2:48:48.480 --> 2:48:52.480]  when epstein's arrested and does he helps get pedophiles
[2:48:52.480 --> 2:48:54.480]  national security clearances
[2:48:54.480 --> 2:48:56.480]  and he wants to put on his twitter and facebook that goes
[2:48:56.480 --> 2:48:58.480]  to water parks and disney by himself
[2:48:58.480 --> 2:49:00.480]  and takes photos of yourself and the kids in the background
[2:49:00.480 --> 2:49:02.480]  and that's just part of it
[2:49:02.480 --> 2:49:04.480]  I mean it's all out in the open
[2:49:04.480 --> 2:49:06.480]  and michael graves former
[2:49:06.480 --> 2:49:08.480]  front man for the misfits
[2:49:08.480 --> 2:49:10.480]  popular bands he plays in today
[2:49:10.480 --> 2:49:12.480]  he's here and he was here with us yesterday
[2:49:12.480 --> 2:49:14.480]  I wanted to bring him back to get into what makes this tick
[2:49:14.480 --> 2:49:16.480]  and when he saw sturt roads he said well sturt wants to hang around
[2:49:16.480 --> 2:49:18.480]  constitutional lawyer founder of the oath keepers
[2:49:18.480 --> 2:49:20.480]  you know have him
[2:49:20.480 --> 2:49:22.480]  weigh in on this
[2:49:22.480 --> 2:49:24.480]  about the nature of good nibbles
[2:49:24.480 --> 2:49:26.480]  so sturt roads with oath keepers.org
[2:49:26.480 --> 2:49:28.480]  be sure and check that out daily
[2:49:28.480 --> 2:49:30.480]  oath keepers.org
[2:49:30.480 --> 2:49:32.480]  and of course michael graves with official michaelgraves.com
[2:49:32.480 --> 2:49:34.480]  they want our guns
[2:49:34.480 --> 2:49:36.480]  control over our minds
[2:49:36.480 --> 2:49:38.480]  and here we are
[2:49:38.480 --> 2:49:40.480]  since you were here first
[2:49:40.480 --> 2:49:42.480]  your view of the fight between good and evil
[2:49:42.480 --> 2:49:44.480]  because it's really becoming clear now
[2:49:44.480 --> 2:49:46.480]  a lot of people didn't believe in god of the devil
[2:49:46.480 --> 2:49:48.480]  they're saying well my gosh
[2:49:48.480 --> 2:49:50.480]  the left suddenly aren't atheists like they always said
[2:49:50.480 --> 2:49:52.480]  they're Satanists.
[2:49:52.480 --> 2:49:54.480]  You know I was just watching a Ted Garneson video yesterday
[2:49:54.480 --> 2:49:56.480]  and I thought he was over the top years ago
[2:49:56.480 --> 2:49:58.480]  but now I'm looking at this
[2:49:58.480 --> 2:50:00.480]  after the Epstein revelations
[2:50:00.480 --> 2:50:02.480]  and other things I've heard about child sex rings
[2:50:02.480 --> 2:50:04.480]  dead on it's dead on
[2:50:04.480 --> 2:50:06.480]  and they're designed to blackmail the politicians
[2:50:06.480 --> 2:50:08.480]  that's what they're all about and that's what he said
[2:50:08.480 --> 2:50:10.480]  he was there at the CIA
[2:50:10.480 --> 2:50:12.480]  the raids on finders and all that
[2:50:12.480 --> 2:50:14.480]  he was high level
[2:50:14.480 --> 2:50:16.480]  he was at the top of the FBI
[2:50:16.480 --> 2:50:18.480]  but when he found out about the devil worship
[2:50:18.480 --> 2:50:20.480]  and hurting kids he said I'm not going to do this
[2:50:20.480 --> 2:50:22.480]  he apologized and said
[2:50:22.480 --> 2:50:24.480]  he was sorry for some of the stuff he did
[2:50:24.480 --> 2:50:26.480]  but he thought he was fighting communists doing dirty stuff
[2:50:26.480 --> 2:50:28.480]  later he found out what was above it
[2:50:28.480 --> 2:50:30.480]  he was spot on
[2:50:30.480 --> 2:50:32.480]  well tell folks
[2:50:32.480 --> 2:50:34.480]  you've worked in DC, you've worked for Ron Paul
[2:50:34.480 --> 2:50:36.480]  you're a veteran
[2:50:36.480 --> 2:50:38.480]  and a constitutional lawyer
[2:50:38.480 --> 2:50:40.480]  about how the blackmail works
[2:50:40.480 --> 2:50:42.480]  that's key the mechanism
[2:50:42.480 --> 2:50:44.480]  it's a demonic Ponzi scheme
[2:50:44.480 --> 2:50:46.480]  it's how they corrupt people
[2:50:46.480 --> 2:50:48.480]  well they're groomed
[2:50:48.480 --> 2:50:50.480]  they groom pedophiles to come into politics
[2:50:50.480 --> 2:50:52.480]  and then they blackmail them with kids
[2:50:52.480 --> 2:50:54.480]  and film them with children
[2:50:54.480 --> 2:50:56.480]  and not just with having sex with children
[2:50:56.480 --> 2:50:58.480]  but also sometimes killing children
[2:50:58.480 --> 2:51:00.480]  Dennis Pastert
[2:51:00.480 --> 2:51:02.480]  never in politics, pedophile
[2:51:02.480 --> 2:51:04.480]  brought in and only in congress
[2:51:04.480 --> 2:51:06.480]  a few years and made the speaker of the house
[2:51:06.480 --> 2:51:08.480]  because he was controlled
[2:51:08.480 --> 2:51:10.480]  it explains like you were saying earlier
[2:51:10.480 --> 2:51:12.480]  it explains how they vote
[2:51:12.480 --> 2:51:14.480]  they're never going to vote against the ones who put them in place
[2:51:14.480 --> 2:51:16.480]  because if they go too far
[2:51:16.480 --> 2:51:18.480]  this is why I don't trust the senate not to
[2:51:18.480 --> 2:51:20.480]  vote for impeachment because they have the same skeletons
[2:51:20.480 --> 2:51:22.480]  in their closet
[2:51:22.480 --> 2:51:24.480]  I was interrupting you just backing up what you're saying
[2:51:24.480 --> 2:51:26.480]  and now why are they trying to externalize it
[2:51:26.480 --> 2:51:28.480]  at
[2:51:28.480 --> 2:51:30.480]  HBO
[2:51:30.480 --> 2:51:32.480]  and at salon and the New York Times
[2:51:32.480 --> 2:51:34.480]  and the drag queen storytime
[2:51:34.480 --> 2:51:36.480]  that's really fat men dresses women
[2:51:36.480 --> 2:51:38.480]  with children riding their erection through their pants
[2:51:38.480 --> 2:51:40.480]  in public why are they coming out with it right now
[2:51:40.480 --> 2:51:42.480]  I think they're hedging their bet
[2:51:42.480 --> 2:51:44.480]  in case they're exposed this way they can
[2:51:44.480 --> 2:51:46.480]  minimize the damage if it's brought out in the open
[2:51:46.480 --> 2:51:48.480]  they're making it cool
[2:51:48.480 --> 2:51:50.480]  that's my gut feeling
[2:51:50.480 --> 2:51:52.480]  and they say in these videos we're grooming your children
[2:51:52.480 --> 2:51:54.480]  yeah they do
[2:51:54.480 --> 2:51:56.480]  they're telling you what they're doing
[2:51:56.480 --> 2:51:58.480]  and so you're going to wind up with a
[2:51:58.480 --> 2:52:00.480]  totalitarian
[2:52:00.480 --> 2:52:02.480]  occultist government over you
[2:52:02.480 --> 2:52:04.480]  that's open about it
[2:52:04.480 --> 2:52:06.480]  that's their end goal is to come out of the closet
[2:52:06.480 --> 2:52:08.480]  eventually
[2:52:08.480 --> 2:52:10.480]  now that they have an AI takeover
[2:52:10.480 --> 2:52:12.480]  they're finally going hey we're not communists
[2:52:12.480 --> 2:52:14.480]  we work for old scratch
[2:52:14.480 --> 2:52:16.480]  we're going to hurt your kids
[2:52:16.480 --> 2:52:18.480]  Michael Graves
[2:52:18.480 --> 2:52:20.480]  you know
[2:52:20.480 --> 2:52:22.480]  taking over the misfits
[2:52:22.480 --> 2:52:24.480]  and the heart of punk rock
[2:52:24.480 --> 2:52:26.480]  rock and roll the occult just everywhere
[2:52:26.480 --> 2:52:28.480]  you were saying yesterday
[2:52:28.480 --> 2:52:30.480]  if we went on a ferry they make it like it's a joke
[2:52:30.480 --> 2:52:32.480]  but it's not a joke is it
[2:52:32.480 --> 2:52:34.480]  it's not a joke because if you start with the premise
[2:52:34.480 --> 2:52:36.480]  that
[2:52:36.480 --> 2:52:38.480]  we are indeed
[2:52:38.480 --> 2:52:40.480]  waging a war on two fronts
[2:52:40.480 --> 2:52:42.480]  there's not only this
[2:52:42.480 --> 2:52:44.480]  this battle that we're having here
[2:52:44.480 --> 2:52:46.480]  in the physical realm
[2:52:46.480 --> 2:52:48.480]  but there's also a spiritual battle
[2:52:48.480 --> 2:52:50.480]  that we are engaged in
[2:52:50.480 --> 2:52:52.480]  the most important of all
[2:52:52.480 --> 2:52:54.480]  if you take that out of the equation
[2:52:54.480 --> 2:52:56.480]  which
[2:52:56.480 --> 2:52:58.480]  Luciferian satanists
[2:52:58.480 --> 2:53:00.480]  the people who don't believe
[2:53:00.480 --> 2:53:02.480]  when you take that out of the equation
[2:53:02.480 --> 2:53:04.480]  and you're just left with the physical
[2:53:04.480 --> 2:53:06.480]  well then it's easy to just
[2:53:06.480 --> 2:53:08.480]  live your life
[2:53:08.480 --> 2:53:10.480]  and do things and go about
[2:53:10.480 --> 2:53:12.480]  your daily business like there is
[2:53:12.480 --> 2:53:14.480]  no consequence to anything
[2:53:14.480 --> 2:53:16.480]  that you do or anything
[2:53:16.480 --> 2:53:18.480]  that you think or anything that you say
[2:53:18.480 --> 2:53:20.480]  and you see
[2:53:20.480 --> 2:53:22.480]  that void in the entertainment
[2:53:22.480 --> 2:53:24.480]  industry and the music industry
[2:53:24.480 --> 2:53:26.480]  and especially
[2:53:26.480 --> 2:53:28.480]  like we were talking about yesterday
[2:53:28.480 --> 2:53:30.480]  in my realm of things
[2:53:30.480 --> 2:53:32.480]  with young people
[2:53:32.480 --> 2:53:34.480]  with all the satanic symbolism
[2:53:36.480 --> 2:53:38.480]  and the
[2:53:38.480 --> 2:53:40.480]  emasculation of Christ
[2:53:40.480 --> 2:53:42.480]  and unaccepting
[2:53:44.480 --> 2:53:46.480]  Jesus as
[2:53:46.480 --> 2:53:48.480]  just as
[2:53:48.480 --> 2:53:50.480]  an entity
[2:53:50.480 --> 2:53:52.480]  and just as viable
[2:53:52.480 --> 2:53:54.480]  and real as the devil
[2:53:56.480 --> 2:53:58.480]  and when
[2:53:58.480 --> 2:54:00.480]  you take that out
[2:54:00.480 --> 2:54:02.480]  you then allow the world
[2:54:02.480 --> 2:54:04.480]  to manifest all of what we see
[2:54:04.480 --> 2:54:06.480]  today
[2:54:06.480 --> 2:54:08.480]  the pedophiles
[2:54:08.480 --> 2:54:10.480]  these drag queen story
[2:54:10.480 --> 2:54:12.480]  our
[2:54:12.480 --> 2:54:14.480]  things
[2:54:14.480 --> 2:54:16.480]  suicide all of the
[2:54:16.480 --> 2:54:18.480]  social ills
[2:54:18.480 --> 2:54:20.480]  the moral depravity that we see
[2:54:20.480 --> 2:54:22.480]  everywhere we're poisoned
[2:54:22.480 --> 2:54:24.480]  the west has been bitten
[2:54:24.480 --> 2:54:26.480]  by a snake
[2:54:28.480 --> 2:54:30.480]  one of the things that you said a couple weeks ago
[2:54:30.480 --> 2:54:32.480]  which is amazing
[2:54:32.480 --> 2:54:34.480]  you said that we are right now in the moment
[2:54:36.480 --> 2:54:38.480]  where the moment between
[2:54:38.480 --> 2:54:40.480]  where the cobra
[2:54:40.480 --> 2:54:42.480]  where the snake
[2:54:42.480 --> 2:54:44.480]  is about to
[2:54:44.480 --> 2:54:46.480]  plunge its teeth into
[2:54:46.480 --> 2:54:48.480]  the meaty thigh
[2:54:48.480 --> 2:54:50.480]  of our country
[2:54:50.480 --> 2:54:52.480]  that moment right before
[2:54:52.480 --> 2:54:54.480]  and that's why the time of choosing
[2:54:54.480 --> 2:54:56.480]  is now and it's a very important time
[2:54:56.480 --> 2:54:58.480]  to make that decision
[2:54:58.480 --> 2:55:00.480]  we are on the brink
[2:55:00.480 --> 2:55:02.480]  you're right because everything else has just been a setup
[2:55:02.480 --> 2:55:04.480]  and now they really want to deal the death blow
[2:55:04.480 --> 2:55:06.480]  and they get you walked up to that point
[2:55:06.480 --> 2:55:08.480]  of Stockholm syndrome where the public accepts
[2:55:08.480 --> 2:55:10.480]  more and more and more and more
[2:55:10.480 --> 2:55:12.480]  and they're just ready for the full horror to come out
[2:55:12.480 --> 2:55:14.480]  rather demoralizing us
[2:55:14.480 --> 2:55:16.480]  making us feel that it's useless to resist them
[2:55:16.480 --> 2:55:18.480]  that's why they're being so open about it
[2:55:18.480 --> 2:55:20.480]  and so
[2:55:20.480 --> 2:55:22.480]  the best way to expose them right now
[2:55:22.480 --> 2:55:24.480]  I believe Trump should do this
[2:55:24.480 --> 2:55:26.480]  is to blow the lid off the NSA
[2:55:26.480 --> 2:55:28.480]  he should have a saunge
[2:55:28.480 --> 2:55:30.480]  he should have
[2:55:30.480 --> 2:55:32.480]  Snowden
[2:55:32.480 --> 2:55:34.480]  blow the lid off and expose absolutely everything
[2:55:34.480 --> 2:55:36.480]  if we do that right now we could stop it
[2:55:36.480 --> 2:55:38.480]  but if we go through the slow march
[2:55:38.480 --> 2:55:40.480]  of them
[2:55:40.480 --> 2:55:42.480]  getting us used to it over a year's time
[2:55:42.480 --> 2:55:44.480]  well that's right if Trump just keeps defeating
[2:55:44.480 --> 2:55:46.480]  each new hoax they bring forward
[2:55:46.480 --> 2:55:48.480]  they still block his agenda and keep him from changing
[2:55:48.480 --> 2:55:50.480]  the subject back to them going to prison
[2:55:50.480 --> 2:55:52.480]  he must go on offense
[2:55:52.480 --> 2:55:54.480]  he can't think he's winning like a football game
[2:55:54.480 --> 2:55:56.480]  beating what they're doing
[2:55:56.480 --> 2:55:58.480]  being involved in that fake fight is losing
[2:55:58.480 --> 2:56:00.480]  exactly right he's playing defense too much
[2:56:00.480 --> 2:56:02.480]  he needs to be aggressive and attack
[2:56:02.480 --> 2:56:04.480]  and the best way to do that is why Epstein showed us the way
[2:56:04.480 --> 2:56:06.480]  is to expose the pedophilia
[2:56:06.480 --> 2:56:08.480]  that's blown a hole in their whole universe
[2:56:08.480 --> 2:56:10.480]  and people really get that now
[2:56:10.480 --> 2:56:12.480]  and they get okay pedophiles rule over us
[2:56:12.480 --> 2:56:14.480]  I mean I'm really seeing the zeitgeist tap there
[2:56:14.480 --> 2:56:16.480]  and why do you think that is
[2:56:16.480 --> 2:56:18.480]  why is that
[2:56:18.480 --> 2:56:20.480]  why do you think Epstein finally has woken up so many people
[2:56:20.480 --> 2:56:22.480]  well he showed that
[2:56:22.480 --> 2:56:24.480]  he was kind of like the camels nose under the tent
[2:56:24.480 --> 2:56:26.480]  they know there's a bigger beast beyond that and they can see it's real
[2:56:26.480 --> 2:56:28.480]  I mean like I said Gunnerson for years
[2:56:28.480 --> 2:56:30.480]  I thought he was going over the top
[2:56:30.480 --> 2:56:32.480]  but no man was right
[2:56:32.480 --> 2:56:34.480]  and Epstein helped expose that
[2:56:34.480 --> 2:56:36.480]  well that's because he would just rattle off and then I busted this
[2:56:36.480 --> 2:56:38.480]  and I found that in this army base
[2:56:38.480 --> 2:56:40.480]  and running the kids and blackmailing people
[2:56:40.480 --> 2:56:42.480]  and PCP and devil work and then it's all real cases
[2:56:42.480 --> 2:56:44.480]  that came out they just declassified
[2:56:44.480 --> 2:56:46.480]  like five inches of it and that's Trump doing that
[2:56:46.480 --> 2:56:48.480]  where it was all true whole towns taken over by Satanist
[2:56:48.480 --> 2:56:50.480]  so what are you
[2:56:50.480 --> 2:56:52.480]  you've got Gunnerson the FBI couldn't even believe it
[2:56:52.480 --> 2:56:54.480]  people wouldn't believe them because it's crazy
[2:56:54.480 --> 2:56:56.480]  some people say well we have to do this step by step
[2:56:56.480 --> 2:56:58.480]  but I think it's too late I think he needs to just blow the lid off
[2:56:58.480 --> 2:57:00.480]  just put it out there
[2:57:00.480 --> 2:57:02.480]  publish it off
[2:57:02.480 --> 2:57:04.480]  you know about the devil worship and the pedophilia
[2:57:04.480 --> 2:57:06.480]  and the sacrifice and they're telling Trump
[2:57:06.480 --> 2:57:08.480]  you can't bring this out it's too horrible
[2:57:08.480 --> 2:57:10.480]  you know what
[2:57:10.480 --> 2:57:12.480]  they know to make it too able to expose
[2:57:12.480 --> 2:57:14.480]  too big to fail then it ends up taking over
[2:57:14.480 --> 2:57:16.480]  no justice be done the habits fall bring it all out
[2:57:16.480 --> 2:57:18.480]  exactly right
[2:57:18.480 --> 2:57:20.480]  yeah again
[2:57:20.480 --> 2:57:22.480]  we're waging
[2:57:22.480 --> 2:57:24.480]  war on two fronts
[2:57:24.480 --> 2:57:26.480]  and
[2:57:26.480 --> 2:57:28.480]  the Epstein
[2:57:28.480 --> 2:57:30.480]  the eugenics things that he was into
[2:57:30.480 --> 2:57:32.480]  it wasn't just pedophile
[2:57:32.480 --> 2:57:34.480]  you know pedophilia it was
[2:57:34.480 --> 2:57:36.480]  he was gathering this the sexual energy
[2:57:36.480 --> 2:57:38.480]  the sexual magic to make a super race
[2:57:38.480 --> 2:57:40.480]  of children that's right he was doing
[2:57:40.480 --> 2:57:42.480]  Alistair Crowley sex magic we'll be right back
[2:57:42.480 --> 2:57:44.480]  Alex yes I got a plug
[2:57:44.480 --> 2:57:46.480]  for the Patriot points I get
[2:57:46.480 --> 2:57:48.480]  oh thank you got $180 so far this year
[2:57:48.480 --> 2:57:50.480]  and I feel like I'm stealing from you
[2:57:50.480 --> 2:57:52.480]  I buy so much in the store because
[2:57:52.480 --> 2:57:54.480]  I mean I don't want to give that money to Walmart
[2:57:54.480 --> 2:57:56.480]  I don't want to give that money to people who are going to donate it to causes I don't believe in
[2:57:56.480 --> 2:57:58.480]  so I'd rather give that money to you
[2:57:58.480 --> 2:58:00.480]  and I'm getting quality products the products that I do
[2:58:00.480 --> 2:58:02.480]  receive have changed my life
[2:58:02.480 --> 2:58:04.480]  I mean the X2 has really done a lot for me
[2:58:04.480 --> 2:58:06.480]  I've lost weight my brain works a whole lot better
[2:58:06.480 --> 2:58:08.480]  my kids they use the toothpaste
[2:58:08.480 --> 2:58:10.480]  my son used to get these little
[2:58:10.480 --> 2:58:12.480]  sore throats and he puts X2 in water
[2:58:12.480 --> 2:58:14.480]  and drinks it and it gets rid of his sore throat
[2:58:14.480 --> 2:58:16.480]  well sir let me break this down for you
[2:58:16.480 --> 2:58:18.480]  I want high quality stuff in there I want a good price
[2:58:18.480 --> 2:58:20.480]  but I've kind of habituated everybody
[2:58:20.480 --> 2:58:22.480]  to where everybody buys when it's 50% off
[2:58:22.480 --> 2:58:24.480]  I'm making $2 on the toothpaste
[2:58:24.480 --> 2:58:26.480]  50% off and so it's the same thing like the fish
[2:58:26.480 --> 2:58:28.480]  oil or the turmeric or the bone broth
[2:58:28.480 --> 2:58:30.480]  thank you so much for the plugs but listen
[2:58:30.480 --> 2:58:32.480]  when people get the Patriot points
[2:58:32.480 --> 2:58:34.480]  a lot of times it makes things a loss later
[2:58:34.480 --> 2:58:36.480]  because if you're already getting 10% off
[2:58:36.480 --> 2:58:38.480]  because you're on autoship then we're doing 50% off
[2:58:38.480 --> 2:58:40.480]  and then you do something like that
[2:58:40.480 --> 2:58:42.480]  we have Patriot points we lose money but that's okay
[2:58:42.480 --> 2:58:44.480]  thanks for the support
[2:58:44.480 --> 2:58:46.480]  all of our bodies are different
[2:58:46.480 --> 2:58:48.480]  all of our metabolic systems
[2:58:48.480 --> 2:58:50.480]  are diverse some of us
[2:58:50.480 --> 2:58:52.480]  are deficient in some things and not
[2:58:52.480 --> 2:58:54.480]  in others there's a lot of factors
[2:58:54.480 --> 2:58:56.480]  that go into this and I'm not telling you something
[2:58:56.480 --> 2:58:58.480]  that you don't know but I'm here to tell you
[2:58:58.480 --> 2:59:00.480]  every time
[2:59:00.480 --> 2:59:02.480]  I commit and use
[2:59:02.480 --> 2:59:04.480]  the supplements that we sell
[2:59:04.480 --> 2:59:06.480]  on a religious basis
[2:59:06.480 --> 2:59:08.480]  my life completely changes
[2:59:08.480 --> 2:59:10.480]  I'm healthier I have more energy
[2:59:10.480 --> 2:59:12.480]  I lose weight I look better
[2:59:12.480 --> 2:59:14.480]  everybody notices
[2:59:14.480 --> 2:59:16.480]  two months ago I said on air I am going to
[2:59:16.480 --> 2:59:18.480]  commit to take
[2:59:18.480 --> 2:59:20.480]  X2 bodies ultimate turmeric
[2:59:20.480 --> 2:59:22.480]  I'm going to commit
[2:59:22.480 --> 2:59:24.480]  to flush my gut out
[2:59:24.480 --> 2:59:26.480]  with the gut fusion from M4's life
[2:59:26.480 --> 2:59:28.480]  and when I take these products
[2:59:28.480 --> 2:59:30.480]  the results are nothing less
[2:59:30.480 --> 2:59:32.480]  than miraculous well one product
[2:59:32.480 --> 2:59:34.480]  that's amazing that I use I don't talk enough about
[2:59:34.480 --> 2:59:36.480]  is gut fusion
[2:59:36.480 --> 2:59:38.480]  folks check it out
[2:59:38.480 --> 2:59:40.480]  there's nothing else like it 50% off
[2:59:40.480 --> 2:59:42.480]  right now the cells about to end
[2:59:42.480 --> 3:00:10.480]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:00:10.480 --> 3:00:12.480]  we're going to get into the mind control
[3:00:12.480 --> 3:00:14.480]  the left and how they're being manipulated
[3:00:14.480 --> 3:00:16.480]  and how they're using the hatred of
[3:00:16.480 --> 3:00:18.480]  Trump to then get people to accept
[3:00:18.480 --> 3:00:20.480]  stuff that's unbelievable I meant to play this a few days ago
[3:00:20.480 --> 3:00:22.480]  but we'll play it start of the next segment
[3:00:22.480 --> 3:00:24.480]  Haley Bennett went out and got
[3:00:24.480 --> 3:00:26.480]  people to literally wipe
[3:00:26.480 --> 3:00:28.480]  their asses in public saying they were
[3:00:28.480 --> 3:00:30.480]  punishing Trump and again
[3:00:30.480 --> 3:00:32.480]  that's the mind control the left it's so crazy
[3:00:32.480 --> 3:00:34.480]  but you were getting Michael Graves
[3:00:34.480 --> 3:00:36.480]  into the
[3:00:36.480 --> 3:00:38.480]  fact that the battle lines are being drawn
[3:00:38.480 --> 3:00:40.480]  and the other she was dropping
[3:00:40.480 --> 3:00:42.480]  yeah
[3:00:42.480 --> 3:00:44.480]  everybody knows what's coming
[3:00:44.480 --> 3:00:46.480]  her just waiting for it to happen
[3:00:46.480 --> 3:00:48.480]  it's a redundant
[3:00:48.480 --> 3:00:50.480]  thing here on this broadcast
[3:00:50.480 --> 3:00:52.480]  that's brought up that
[3:00:52.480 --> 3:00:54.480]  Antifa is going to be used as canon
[3:00:54.480 --> 3:00:56.480]  fodder there's going to be false flags
[3:00:56.480 --> 3:00:58.480]  run against them there's
[3:00:58.480 --> 3:01:00.480]  going to be some sort of
[3:01:00.480 --> 3:01:02.480]  violent action that then
[3:01:02.480 --> 3:01:04.480]  is intended to
[3:01:04.480 --> 3:01:06.480]  create a
[3:01:06.480 --> 3:01:08.480]  counteraction
[3:01:08.480 --> 3:01:10.480]  to set up
[3:01:10.480 --> 3:01:12.480]  conservatives
[3:01:12.480 --> 3:01:14.480]  to set us up is to give
[3:01:14.480 --> 3:01:16.480]  the
[3:01:16.480 --> 3:01:18.480]  this
[3:01:18.480 --> 3:01:20.480]  what we're facing here
[3:01:20.480 --> 3:01:22.480]  and that's why they keep saying Alex Jones is illegal
[3:01:22.480 --> 3:01:24.480]  station raided people arrested
[3:01:24.480 --> 3:01:26.480]  there was no station no one was arrested just didn't
[3:01:26.480 --> 3:01:28.480]  happen or Alex Jones
[3:01:28.480 --> 3:01:30.480]  has child porn Alex Jones loses lawsuits
[3:01:30.480 --> 3:01:32.480]  none of it's real but they're just getting everybody
[3:01:32.480 --> 3:01:34.480]  used to like last week arrest Alex Jones
[3:01:34.480 --> 3:01:36.480]  jury tampering they do it to Trump
[3:01:36.480 --> 3:01:38.480]  so when it really happens people don't
[3:01:38.480 --> 3:01:40.480]  care because they already heard it over and over again
[3:01:40.480 --> 3:01:42.480]  right and
[3:01:42.480 --> 3:01:44.480]  and what we were talking about was that
[3:01:44.480 --> 3:01:46.480]  why the Epstein thing
[3:01:46.480 --> 3:01:48.480]  is such an it is so important
[3:01:48.480 --> 3:01:50.480]  because everybody knows it everybody
[3:01:50.480 --> 3:01:52.480]  feels it
[3:01:52.480 --> 3:01:54.480]  you can you can feel it in the air
[3:01:54.480 --> 3:01:56.480]  and and and it's and
[3:01:56.480 --> 3:01:58.480]  we know it's about to happen
[3:01:58.480 --> 3:02:00.480]  any day any day now
[3:02:00.480 --> 3:02:02.480]  I just read an article
[3:02:02.480 --> 3:02:04.480]  before I
[3:02:04.480 --> 3:02:06.480]  came on air again where you said
[3:02:06.480 --> 3:02:08.480]  everybody has come after
[3:02:08.480 --> 3:02:10.480]  info wars everybody's come after
[3:02:10.480 --> 3:02:12.480]  Trump and you kept on saying that
[3:02:12.480 --> 3:02:14.480]  if you don't stand up and fight
[3:02:14.480 --> 3:02:16.480]  for you and fight for info wars
[3:02:16.480 --> 3:02:18.480]  that they're going to come for everybody else
[3:02:18.480 --> 3:02:20.480]  there was an article of CNN
[3:02:20.480 --> 3:02:22.480]  I'm going after Hannity
[3:02:22.480 --> 3:02:24.480]  and Tucker Carlson were their names
[3:02:24.480 --> 3:02:26.480]  and this is right wing media fingerprints
[3:02:26.480 --> 3:02:28.480]  are all over the depositions and the impeachment
[3:02:28.480 --> 3:02:30.480]  and info wars is mentioned
[3:02:30.480 --> 3:02:32.480]  in that article as well
[3:02:32.480 --> 3:02:34.480]  I think it was from Brian Stelzer
[3:02:34.480 --> 3:02:36.480]  it's an opinion piece
[3:02:36.480 --> 3:02:38.480]  oh yeah they're going after everybody
[3:02:38.480 --> 3:02:40.480]  yeah definitely
[3:02:40.480 --> 3:02:42.480]  that's why we have to stand up the coup
[3:02:42.480 --> 3:02:44.480]  against Trump I believe is the most important thing
[3:02:44.480 --> 3:02:46.480]  to focus on right now I agree
[3:02:46.480 --> 3:02:48.480]  because it's right in your face and you've got half the country
[3:02:48.480 --> 3:02:50.480]  half the politically aware
[3:02:50.480 --> 3:02:52.480]  part of the country that's behind the president
[3:02:52.480 --> 3:02:54.480]  is there any way to get through
[3:02:54.480 --> 3:02:56.480]  to these leftist zombies because
[3:02:56.480 --> 3:02:58.480]  because more and more they're adopting the satanic
[3:02:58.480 --> 3:03:00.480]  operating system like used to
[3:03:00.480 --> 3:03:02.480]  a few years ago the average leftist just was an idiot
[3:03:02.480 --> 3:03:04.480]  thought everybody was really a racist now they go
[3:03:04.480 --> 3:03:06.480]  I just want to kill babies that's you that's America
[3:03:06.480 --> 3:03:08.480]  I mean they've really like taken on something
[3:03:08.480 --> 3:03:10.480]  Alex I don't think that there's a way to get
[3:03:10.480 --> 3:03:12.480]  through to some to most of them
[3:03:14.480 --> 3:03:16.480]  there's no way
[3:03:16.480 --> 3:03:18.480]  because they are so far gone
[3:03:18.480 --> 3:03:20.480]  that
[3:03:20.480 --> 3:03:22.480]  again it's like
[3:03:22.480 --> 3:03:24.480]  it's like the Holy Spirit
[3:03:24.480 --> 3:03:26.480]  the Holy Spirit will continue to speak to you
[3:03:26.480 --> 3:03:28.480]  God will continue to reach out to you
[3:03:28.480 --> 3:03:30.480]  until your heart is so hard
[3:03:30.480 --> 3:03:32.480]  and that you can no longer hear it it's not that
[3:03:32.480 --> 3:03:34.480]  God the Holy Spirit is trying to
[3:03:34.480 --> 3:03:36.480]  convict your heart so that you can't hear it
[3:03:36.480 --> 3:03:38.480]  these people and then when God stops
[3:03:38.480 --> 3:03:40.480]  because you're gone you fall completely
[3:03:40.480 --> 3:03:42.480]  to it that's why I see people overnight
[3:03:42.480 --> 3:03:44.480]  turn into evil and then they
[3:03:44.480 --> 3:03:46.480]  and then they're literally mentally ill
[3:03:46.480 --> 3:03:48.480]  and just hurt themselves and others after it's like
[3:03:48.480 --> 3:03:50.480]  they literally are taken over
[3:03:50.480 --> 3:03:52.480]  by a kill switch well look at abortion
[3:03:52.480 --> 3:03:54.480]  you know it wasn't you know 30 years ago
[3:03:54.480 --> 3:03:56.480]  it was it was considered
[3:03:56.480 --> 3:03:58.480]  a crime against the child
[3:03:58.480 --> 3:04:00.480]  to kill the baby now
[3:04:00.480 --> 3:04:02.480]  you've got leftists celebrating their abortions
[3:04:02.480 --> 3:04:04.480]  I have hours
[3:04:04.480 --> 3:04:06.480]  of video of feminist groups
[3:04:06.480 --> 3:04:08.480]  and mainline shows going they are babies
[3:04:08.480 --> 3:04:10.480]  and we like cutting them up slowly
[3:04:10.480 --> 3:04:12.480]  those little bastards will never have a life
[3:04:12.480 --> 3:04:14.480]  and I feel good stealing it from them
[3:04:14.480 --> 3:04:16.480]  it makes me powerful
[3:04:16.480 --> 3:04:18.480]  we've got the video I played it and people see this
[3:04:18.480 --> 3:04:20.480]  and start crying this is on CNN
[3:04:20.480 --> 3:04:22.480]  this is on Netflix
[3:04:22.480 --> 3:04:24.480]  and I mean as a man I feel guilty
[3:04:24.480 --> 3:04:26.480]  that I'm not getting in a car
[3:04:26.480 --> 3:04:28.480]  and going and protecting those babies
[3:04:28.480 --> 3:04:30.480]  but these devil worshipers are everywhere
[3:04:30.480 --> 3:04:32.480]  imagine 30 years from now what it'll be like
[3:04:32.480 --> 3:04:34.480]  with live children post birth
[3:04:34.480 --> 3:04:36.480]  well you heard the dub and we keep them comfortable
[3:04:36.480 --> 3:04:38.480]  right and comfortable
[3:04:38.480 --> 3:04:40.480]  well they line up all the bitters for their organs
[3:04:40.480 --> 3:04:42.480]  the mom doesn't know where the baby go
[3:04:42.480 --> 3:04:44.480]  oh you just open baby go
[3:04:44.480 --> 3:04:46.480]  baby's over in this little area and they're waiting
[3:04:46.480 --> 3:04:48.480]  getting all the orders in and they're creating a whole
[3:04:48.480 --> 3:04:50.480]  medical tyranny ladies and gentlemen
[3:04:50.480 --> 3:04:52.480]  oh my god
[3:04:52.480 --> 3:04:54.480]  in full wars life has done it again
[3:04:54.480 --> 3:04:56.480]  with undoubtedly our biggest
[3:04:56.480 --> 3:04:58.480]  breakthrough yet
[3:04:58.480 --> 3:05:00.480]  super silver whitening
[3:05:00.480 --> 3:05:02.480]  toothpaste
[3:05:02.480 --> 3:05:04.480]  this is proprietary
[3:05:04.480 --> 3:05:06.480]  this is with the top lab in the country
[3:05:06.480 --> 3:05:08.480]  and it is incredibly high quality
[3:05:08.480 --> 3:05:10.480]  this is the best toothpaste
[3:05:10.480 --> 3:05:12.480]  you're going to find
[3:05:12.480 --> 3:05:14.480]  it's called whitening toothpaste
[3:05:14.480 --> 3:05:16.480]  but really it knocks out the bacteria
[3:05:16.480 --> 3:05:18.480]  it recalcifies the teeth
[3:05:18.480 --> 3:05:20.480]  on so many fronts
[3:05:20.480 --> 3:05:22.480]  these beautiful tubes of super silver
[3:05:22.480 --> 3:05:24.480]  toothpaste are available
[3:05:24.480 --> 3:05:26.480]  at an introductory price of 25%
[3:05:26.480 --> 3:05:28.480]  off out of the gates it's as low as we can go
[3:05:28.480 --> 3:05:30.480]  and they're going to sell out
[3:05:30.480 --> 3:05:32.480]  very very quickly
[3:05:32.480 --> 3:05:34.480]  super silver whitening toothpaste
[3:05:34.480 --> 3:05:36.480]  is going to be a hit
[3:05:36.480 --> 3:05:38.480]  I'm very very proud of it
[3:05:38.480 --> 3:05:40.480]  I want to thank my father a retired dentist
[3:05:40.480 --> 3:05:42.480]  for spearheading this the last two years
[3:05:42.480 --> 3:05:44.480]  and developing it it's 25%
[3:05:44.480 --> 3:05:46.480]  off out of the gates it's as low as we can go
[3:05:46.480 --> 3:05:48.480]  it's as expensive to produce
[3:05:48.480 --> 3:06:14.480]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[3:06:18.480 --> 3:06:20.480]  Tony
[3:06:20.480 --> 3:06:22.480]  Ali Wood Babylon
[3:06:40.480 --> 3:06:42.480]  this is very serious folks
[3:06:42.480 --> 3:06:44.480]  you can feel it you can see it
[3:06:44.480 --> 3:06:46.480]  we've got trump we're all invincible
[3:06:46.480 --> 3:06:50.320]  smoke in the dope. We are in one hell of a fight. I know our audience knows that
[3:06:50.320 --> 3:06:54.520]  because you're activist and we love you. But you had a great question for Michael
[3:06:54.520 --> 3:06:58.080]  during the break. You were saying paralleling things. Repeat that. Right.
[3:06:58.080 --> 3:07:01.360]  We saw the whole spirit-cooking thing come out during the election. How's that
[3:07:01.360 --> 3:07:04.320]  tie-in with what you see in the music industry with all the symbolism of
[3:07:04.320 --> 3:07:10.960]  Satan worshiping? Well kids think that that that sort of thing is is cool, right?
[3:07:10.960 --> 3:07:16.320]  And well then the question is posed. Well why why why do kids, why do young people
[3:07:16.320 --> 3:07:21.480]  especially gravitate to that sort of thing? Why do they think that that's cool?
[3:07:21.480 --> 3:07:25.600]  And it's because of the breakdown in the family, the breakdown in in in
[3:07:25.600 --> 3:07:33.320]  religion. When you take that, when you take God, when you take Jesus out of out
[3:07:33.320 --> 3:07:38.880]  of the equation, right? What we feel, what I feel in in my life is the
[3:07:38.880 --> 3:07:43.320]  manifestation of the victory of Christ and that feels good and that is
[3:07:43.320 --> 3:07:48.400]  powerful because it's because Christ beat evil. When you take that away and
[3:07:48.400 --> 3:07:53.520]  you're not born with it, your soul, these young people who I see every night, I
[3:07:53.520 --> 3:07:58.200]  talk to them every night, a lot of them they have pain in their eyes. Their souls
[3:07:58.200 --> 3:08:05.160]  are wounded. 89% of UK Gen Xers, they feel their lives are meaningless.
[3:08:05.160 --> 3:08:09.040]  2008. Oh the depression, the suicides all off the chart and number one cause of
[3:08:09.040 --> 3:08:14.000]  death worldwide. 50 year peaks and suicide on and on and this increase in
[3:08:14.000 --> 3:08:18.760]  exorcism, the manifestation of it is everywhere. So when you take that away,
[3:08:18.760 --> 3:08:23.920]  there's this longing for something. They want, young people they want. And again
[3:08:23.920 --> 3:08:26.960]  under this demonic system, I've talked to the top psychiatrists involved with all
[3:08:26.960 --> 3:08:29.360]  the serial killers or devil worshipers. You never see it on the news but they
[3:08:29.360 --> 3:08:32.440]  admit that's what's happening. They only feel alive when they're doing
[3:08:32.440 --> 3:08:36.120]  something bad. They're sad, they're depressed, they're scared, except when
[3:08:36.120 --> 3:08:39.560]  they're killing and hurting people. So that's the next level of the bondage.
[3:08:39.560 --> 3:08:43.000]  You can become a total slave that has to go out and do these horrible things.
[3:08:43.000 --> 3:08:48.240]  That's in the criminology. So where do they go for this to fill that void? They
[3:08:48.240 --> 3:08:51.520]  look out across the landscape of entertainment. They look out through the
[3:08:51.520 --> 3:08:55.520]  landscape of music and the feedback and what comes back to them, what
[3:08:55.520 --> 3:08:59.080]  resonates with them is what the people that they're looking up to and they
[3:08:59.080 --> 3:09:06.600]  feel is what they need to be to have a to have a fulfilled life. And there it
[3:09:06.600 --> 3:09:14.040]  all is, is all of these people that are championing all of the moral depravity
[3:09:14.040 --> 3:09:18.160]  that we see across the spectrum, across the landscape. And they're setting up,
[3:09:18.160 --> 3:09:22.120]  this happens in every culture when it collapses. A system where if you're in
[3:09:22.120 --> 3:09:27.000]  the inner priesthood, you get to hurt children and women, virgins. It means
[3:09:27.000 --> 3:09:31.360]  innocence. Every culture falls to this force that wants the blood of innocence
[3:09:31.360 --> 3:09:37.240]  and every ancient culture believed they were talking to off-world entities from
[3:09:37.240 --> 3:09:41.600]  the stars that were giving them mathematics, you know, things like that if
[3:09:41.600 --> 3:09:46.560]  they would do bad things. But the coin of the realm was to burn children, to rape
[3:09:46.560 --> 3:09:50.800]  children, to kill children. Now that's a fact. That's what humans do. It's not
[3:09:50.800 --> 3:09:54.800]  normal, it's not natural, but it manifests historically to it. You're right. Look at
[3:09:54.800 --> 3:09:59.560]  the cartels. You know, they went down that spiral 10 years ago that would not
[3:09:59.560 --> 3:10:04.040]  hurt children. Now it's all about raping women and children and slowing them to
[3:10:04.040 --> 3:10:08.680]  sex slavery and torturing the death. So that's the right. That's
[3:10:08.680 --> 3:10:12.800]  the path they go down. And it reminds me of Alicia Crowley, right? Do as thou wilt.
[3:10:12.800 --> 3:10:17.960]  That's the whole point. Just do as you want to. It's all about whatever you
[3:10:17.960 --> 3:10:21.880]  want to do and it's not about being moral. Let's be clear. Massive taboo in
[3:10:21.880 --> 3:10:26.000]  Latin America and any old-world culture that comes out of Spain. You don't touch
[3:10:26.000 --> 3:10:30.080]  women and children. Right. And now it's all about what will you do to women and
[3:10:30.080 --> 3:10:34.480]  children? Yep. But be a real hard-ass. If you're their hard-ass, be tortured women
[3:10:34.480 --> 3:10:39.160]  and children. That's how you're really a tough guy. Alistair Crowley just took an
[3:10:39.160 --> 3:10:45.440]  amalgamation of all different things that are satanic and luciferian and
[3:10:45.440 --> 3:10:49.200]  just kind of made a mishmash of everything. There's some people say,
[3:10:49.200 --> 3:10:53.360]  oh, Alistair Crowley, you know, it says in there in the in the tenets of satanic
[3:10:53.360 --> 3:10:58.080]  church that it's all deception to make it sound nice to get you in. Right. That's
[3:10:58.080 --> 3:11:03.120]  the truth. We talk about solutions. One of the solutions that I would like
[3:11:03.120 --> 3:11:08.040]  to propose is that we need to, in the music and art culture community, punk
[3:11:08.040 --> 3:11:12.360]  rock, wherever, there needs to be an intellectual side of things. And we need
[3:11:12.360 --> 3:11:18.240]  to start with Genesis. When God made his covenant with Abram, he said the
[3:11:18.240 --> 3:11:23.600]  iniquity of the Amorites is still is not complete. So then you have to pose the
[3:11:23.600 --> 3:11:26.840]  question, well, who was he talking about? What was he talking about? Who were the
[3:11:26.840 --> 3:11:30.120]  Amorites? And when then when you move forward through history and you figure
[3:11:30.120 --> 3:11:34.240]  that out and Leo Zagami is just wonderful. Well, that's the thing is you have to
[3:11:34.240 --> 3:11:37.800]  read it. It's all coded. There were people, God was just saying there's only one group
[3:11:37.800 --> 3:11:40.560]  of people that haven't been totally turned over to evil so far, was trying to
[3:11:40.560 --> 3:11:44.760]  protect that. Exactly. It was all sorts of stuff going on. All of these people, the
[3:11:44.760 --> 3:11:53.240]  Amorites, were worshiping the same gods, the same beings, whether it be Malak, or
[3:11:53.240 --> 3:11:58.840]  Baal, or Dagon, all of them. They all wanted little kids. They all wanted little kids.
[3:11:58.840 --> 3:12:04.200]  And it's very telling. And again, Leo Zagami came on the show and told
[3:12:04.200 --> 3:12:08.840]  everybody, told the audience about the the statue that has been that has been
[3:12:08.840 --> 3:12:14.040]  placed in the middle of... Roll the footage to the founder of
[3:12:14.040 --> 3:12:21.080]  fascism, who literally created Benicio Mussolini, who then helped
[3:12:21.080 --> 3:12:26.080]  create Hitler, literally had real satanic rituals and made the first silent
[3:12:26.080 --> 3:12:31.000]  film with this model of Moloch showing the sacrifice of children. Just just go
[3:12:31.000 --> 3:12:35.240]  to YouTube and type in silent film, Moloch child sacrifice. It'll come right up.
[3:12:35.240 --> 3:12:41.040]  And there it is. And then Hitler came out of that. I mean, it's just crazy.
[3:12:41.040 --> 3:12:46.320]  Want to comment, sir? Pretty heavy stuff. It is. But you know, this is the fight
[3:12:46.320 --> 3:12:48.960]  we're in. Like you said, you have to realize there's a spiritual element to
[3:12:48.960 --> 3:12:53.120]  this and it's a battle of good and evil. And we have to dismantle up to it. We got
[3:12:53.120 --> 3:12:56.520]  to be the crusaders. Well, how are they going to deal with this though? Because they
[3:12:56.520 --> 3:12:59.880]  teach, oh, there is no God. We're just machines. There's no free will. But
[3:12:59.880 --> 3:13:04.800]  they've got a will. Do as thou wilt to dominate us is the whole of the law. And
[3:13:04.800 --> 3:13:08.520]  then they're just everywhere saying, we have a God. It's the post-human world. We've
[3:13:08.520 --> 3:13:11.560]  got to save the planet from humans. But they're actually overriding with genetic
[3:13:11.560 --> 3:13:14.800]  engineering and killing the planet. And you find out that these totally selfish
[3:13:14.800 --> 3:13:19.040]  people, whether people believe in a physical devil or not, these people
[3:13:19.040 --> 3:13:22.720]  running world government are super dangerous and bad. And their operating
[3:13:22.720 --> 3:13:26.160]  system is Satanism. I mean, you cannot make this up.
[3:13:27.440 --> 3:13:33.160]  Communism and socialism is a counterfeit of Christianity. I said this yesterday on
[3:13:33.160 --> 3:13:39.400]  the program that communism and socialism starts with the premise that man is
[3:13:39.400 --> 3:13:43.560]  flawed in these systems and the institutions that they are trying to
[3:13:43.560 --> 3:13:50.080]  implement in our country and across the world is to fix the flaw in man and
[3:13:50.080 --> 3:13:56.160]  set up this utopia, this kingdom here on earth. But what believers believe is
[3:13:56.160 --> 3:14:01.560]  that man is flawed no matter what. We came into this world flawed in the only
[3:14:01.560 --> 3:14:09.600]  way to fix that is through the grace of God and through and through accepting
[3:14:09.600 --> 3:14:13.720]  Jesus Christ and what God's free will. So we don't get the transmission and
[3:14:13.720 --> 3:14:18.480]  it's a they've proven DNA is electrochemical and receives and transmits.
[3:14:18.800 --> 3:14:22.240]  So again, the other dimensions are just as real as this. They prove it
[3:14:22.240 --> 3:14:25.400]  mathematically. And so this transmission is being sent in, but you don't get it
[3:14:25.400 --> 3:14:28.160]  unless you want it. The devil is going to hit you with his transmission,
[3:14:28.200 --> 3:14:30.200]  whether you want it or not. He's going to rape your ass.
[3:14:30.200 --> 3:14:34.280]  He's the father of lies. And so you have all these people say, ah, that's just
[3:14:34.280 --> 3:14:39.800]  not true, Alex. That's not true. All these different dimensions and and this
[3:14:39.800 --> 3:14:43.480]  is where it's at. But the globalists are all obsessed with it. And Elon Musk said,
[3:14:43.480 --> 3:14:46.080]  yeah, I was led into the top billionaires. They all believe there's other
[3:14:46.080 --> 3:14:48.760]  dimensions and these entities that want to get rid of humans are running it.
[3:14:48.760 --> 3:14:52.040]  And now Elon Musk clearly, whether it was Ford or against it before, he's
[3:14:52.040 --> 3:14:55.640]  given into it now. Now he says, starting next year, brain chips for your kids.
[3:14:55.640 --> 3:15:00.200]  Like you said, Marxism is their religion. It's that's their it's like Marxist,
[3:15:00.200 --> 3:15:04.280]  their version of Jesus. Of course, radicals Islam doesn't doesn't buy into
[3:15:04.280 --> 3:15:09.240]  that. It's it's Allah. It's it's Mohammed, but they'll use that. And for the Marxists,
[3:15:09.240 --> 3:15:12.920]  that's why it's hard to talk to them, because that's their religion. You're
[3:15:12.920 --> 3:15:16.840]  questioning their fundamental belief structure. You talked about the two
[3:15:16.840 --> 3:15:19.560]  minutes of hate. We come back. I want to hit that in a few calls. You guys got
[3:15:19.560 --> 3:15:22.200]  to come back in. I'm glad you were in Texas. What are you doing in Texas?
[3:15:22.200 --> 3:15:25.880]  I'm taking a breather before I go back out to the next chump rally. We're going to
[3:15:25.880 --> 3:15:31.000]  be there in a Bosch, Bocher, Bocher, Louisiana. All right. Well, I hear you
[3:15:31.000 --> 3:15:34.520]  guys have been there when Caitlyn gets beat up. She's not with you. So yes, you
[3:15:34.520 --> 3:15:37.640]  need to talk to Caitlyn Bennett anytime you're out there. We can't afford the
[3:15:37.640 --> 3:15:41.160]  security for our reporters. So thank you for doing that. You bet. I'd be happy to

[3:17:52.200 --> 3:17:58.200]  I've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers from FullWars. Your support and your help
[3:17:58.200 --> 3:18:03.720]  in rebooting Americana is a challenge to the globalist system of corporate tyranny,
[3:18:03.720 --> 3:18:08.440]  has really caught hold not just here in the U.S. but worldwide. And President Trump's
[3:18:08.440 --> 3:18:13.640]  fearlessness when it comes to promoting Americana and basic liberty is amazing as well.
[3:18:14.280 --> 3:18:19.400]  He's still lacking on the big tech censorship, taking action against that in some other areas,
[3:18:19.400 --> 3:18:23.400]  but trying to end the wars, boosting our economy, speaking out against communist China.
[3:18:23.400 --> 3:18:28.920]  Trump's been doing an amazing job, but now more than ever we really have to realize that
[3:18:29.640 --> 3:18:35.400]  we're being targeted because we are effective and the globalists are beginning to lose their war
[3:18:36.200 --> 3:18:40.120]  against humanity in a big way. And so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them,
[3:18:40.120 --> 3:18:45.960]  but it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us.
[3:18:45.960 --> 3:18:51.160]  That's an attempt to demoralize us. We've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy.
[3:18:51.160 --> 3:18:54.760]  The Alex Jones Show
[3:18:54.760 --> 3:19:00.520]  A few days ago, my 11-year-old daughter came to me and she had her digital textbook. She said,
[3:19:00.520 --> 3:19:05.480]  Dad, they're teaching us about the periodic table and I clicked on iodine and it says that two
[3:19:05.480 --> 3:19:10.440]  billion people have low IQs or mentally retarded on the planet Earth because they didn't get enough
[3:19:10.440 --> 3:19:15.080]  iodine. That's what you say all the time, but I've heard people say you're crazy and it's not true,
[3:19:15.080 --> 3:19:20.120]  but Dad, it's right here on the periodic table when I click it saying exactly what you said.
[3:19:20.120 --> 3:19:25.160]  And I said, I know, honey, that's why I have you take the high-quality nutraceutical grade.
[3:19:25.160 --> 3:19:31.240]  Iodine is because it's why you're so vibrant, it's why you're so alive. It's one of the reasons
[3:19:32.280 --> 3:19:36.920]  that you're so much healthier and smarter than most of the kids you're age. And it just really
[3:19:36.920 --> 3:19:43.080]  blew her away to read it there for herself. They know that two billion people, ladies and gentlemen,
[3:19:43.080 --> 3:19:48.120]  two billion are mentally retarded on the face of the Earth right now because of iodine deficiency.
[3:19:48.120 --> 3:19:52.040]  Research it and find out for yourself now. Infowars.com.
[3:19:55.880 --> 3:19:58.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:06.760 --> 3:20:14.760]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[3:20:14.760 --> 3:20:32.200]  This magic moment, so different and so new wasn't like any other until I kiss you and then it happened.
[3:20:32.200 --> 3:20:43.640]  It took me by surprise. I knew that you felt the truth by the look of your eyes.
[3:20:43.640 --> 3:21:01.000]  I love that album you did doing old covers, Michael Graves official Michael Graves.com.
[3:21:01.000 --> 3:21:07.320]  So again, I told my wife many times, I love the rawness of the original misfits,
[3:21:07.320 --> 3:21:12.920]  but you guys did just overall a lot better music. Yeah, that album was after I left.
[3:21:12.920 --> 3:21:20.280]  That's Jerry doing that. But yeah, we were a great band. It's all good stuff.
[3:21:20.280 --> 3:21:22.520]  Where do people find all your works at officialmichaelgraves.com?
[3:21:25.640 --> 3:21:28.520]  Now, expanding on where we were going with all this,
[3:21:32.280 --> 3:21:37.480]  what do you think we should do about it? I think we should continue to do exactly what we're doing.
[3:21:37.480 --> 3:21:45.320]  The time to be scared and to be fearful of the repercussions of standing up and saying something,
[3:21:45.320 --> 3:21:51.880]  appearing on programs like this is over. We have reached the point of no return.
[3:21:52.600 --> 3:21:57.000]  You just look across the landscape of all the things that we see happening
[3:21:57.000 --> 3:22:07.640]  from the pedophile stuff, from the drag queen story hours, the attack on our institutions,
[3:22:07.640 --> 3:22:13.960]  the attack, the whole attack on everything. And let's be clear, people say, why do we
[3:22:13.960 --> 3:22:18.040]  obsess on this? You can't turn on a children's show. You can't go to a movie. You can't open
[3:22:18.040 --> 3:22:23.880]  it everywhere. This is what the establishment believes. This is their religion. And they're
[3:22:23.880 --> 3:22:29.960]  just capturing everything and hammering everyone with it. You were getting into Alistair Crowley
[3:22:29.960 --> 3:22:33.320]  researcher in the break. Yeah, he found a Thelema, which is the underpinnings of the
[3:22:33.320 --> 3:22:38.040]  Church of Satan. And his writings on Thelema, like you said before, is a mishmash of all the
[3:22:38.040 --> 3:22:42.120]  other stuff, all the occultist things. That was the basis for the modern Church of Satan.
[3:22:42.920 --> 3:22:49.560]  He reportedly sacrificed his own son. Was that right? Yeah, son died on the side of a mountain
[3:22:49.560 --> 3:22:55.960]  top in Spain with him. So you look at Alistair Crowley as kind of the font of the modern,
[3:22:56.840 --> 3:23:04.520]  because you could call it the radical left or the globalist, philosophical and religious beliefs
[3:23:04.520 --> 3:23:09.880]  come right from Crowley. Fully entrenched in the music and entertainment industry. I know firsthand
[3:23:09.880 --> 3:23:18.840]  that people that work for MTV News, for example, one of which who now runs the music department of
[3:23:18.840 --> 3:23:26.280]  Kickstarter openly says Hail Satan, it's on, it's out in the open. I think that it's,
[3:23:27.320 --> 3:23:33.720]  we can't as well forget the energy part of this is very, very important. We were talking about
[3:23:33.720 --> 3:23:41.240]  what Epstein was doing and trying to gather and keep all of this, this, the sex magic they call it
[3:23:41.240 --> 3:23:48.120]  and keep it alive. They were trying to gather it and keep it alive to manipulate it to then
[3:23:48.120 --> 3:23:55.320]  obviously put it out and continuing it through our world for, for it to do its work. And that's
[3:23:55.320 --> 3:24:01.720]  why our work here and what I'm trying to do coming on here and talking about Jesus and saying the
[3:24:01.720 --> 3:24:08.840]  word Jesus and talking about God and spirituality is very important. Because the enemy is getting
[3:24:08.840 --> 3:24:17.480]  their direction and their power and their impetus. It's what triggers them to go out and do this.
[3:24:17.480 --> 3:24:21.160]  And it's very, very real and you're absolutely right that people say, how did you know Epstein
[3:24:21.160 --> 3:24:27.240]  was involved in eugenics? Because he ran stuff for Bill and Melinda Gates. He ran these organizations
[3:24:27.240 --> 3:24:31.960]  that that's what they do, ladies and gentlemen. That's who runs the system. Why would they do
[3:24:31.960 --> 3:24:36.680]  such evil things? Because they're working for the God of this world who can give them all the money
[3:24:36.680 --> 3:24:41.800]  and all the power. And so they're just pawns. You see a Bill Gates, that little evil elf,
[3:24:41.800 --> 3:24:46.520]  he's just a pawn. You see these people, they are pawns. They have turned themselves over to it.
[3:24:46.520 --> 3:24:50.440]  I mean, take Mark Dice. I can tell the story because he's told it on air. And I know the inside
[3:24:50.440 --> 3:24:55.640]  baseball because I was involved with a big reality TV show that didn't make us pledge Satan for the
[3:24:55.640 --> 3:25:01.080]  show. But he got the show, got, you know, bad topics. So we got off the show and I quit going
[3:25:01.080 --> 3:25:08.360]  out to LA over 10 years ago on a routine basis. And Mark Dice had this show where they big, you
[3:25:08.360 --> 3:25:14.120]  know, quote rock star family, you know, a name, maybe said around the dinner table, people would
[3:25:14.120 --> 3:25:19.080]  know the name. And it wasn't that person doing it. They got there with a lead producer. They said,
[3:25:19.080 --> 3:25:25.560]  Mark, this is one last thing. We need you to pledge yourself to Lucifer. You know, we follow
[3:25:25.560 --> 3:25:29.960]  Lucifer here and that's what we do. And it wasn't to freak him out because, you know, Mark's a
[3:25:29.960 --> 3:25:35.320]  Christian. It was literally we just need you to pledge yourself to the devil to get lined up with
[3:25:35.320 --> 3:25:38.600]  the energy and Mark said, I'm not gonna do it. They said, well, you're not getting the show.
[3:25:38.600 --> 3:25:43.240]  So that's that's what goes on. That's why Bob Dylan at least tells people he made a deal with the
[3:25:43.240 --> 3:25:47.160]  devil and then then everything followed. And people say, Oh, that's great. I'll go do that.
[3:25:49.560 --> 3:25:53.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, Bob Dylan didn't get his talent from the devil. The devil just greased
[3:25:53.640 --> 3:25:59.960]  the skids in the world. It's like this wireless internet of that these entities are real that
[3:25:59.960 --> 3:26:04.600]  are controlling it. So because they can jump between dimensions and the devil is an omnipresent,
[3:26:04.600 --> 3:26:11.480]  understands how systems work. It's like AI, it can give you all this power. But at the cost of
[3:26:11.480 --> 3:26:16.200]  your soul, but because you can't see your soul and can't see the other stuff that's around you,
[3:26:16.200 --> 3:26:19.960]  even though it's been proven it's all there, you know, mathematically and with spectrometers
[3:26:19.960 --> 3:26:24.920]  and the rest of it, people then sell everything thinking that they're not selling anything at all.
[3:26:24.920 --> 3:26:28.600]  And then you don't even really get anything. You become a slave and have to do all these
[3:26:28.600 --> 3:26:33.800]  horrible things or the devil comes after you because once the devil's got you, man, let me tell
[3:26:33.800 --> 3:26:42.040]  you that these people are tortured that serve Satan. Yes, definitely. You know, something
[3:26:42.040 --> 3:26:47.080]  Michael talked about earlier. What's the what's the allure to the average kid listening to punk
[3:26:47.080 --> 3:26:52.840]  rock band or rock band? You know, it's it's power. It's feeling that they've got something bigger
[3:26:52.840 --> 3:26:59.160]  than themselves. And Christianity has, I think, in some ways failed to provide that. There's not
[3:26:59.160 --> 3:27:05.480]  enough of a connection to to what this what this really is. And men in particular, I think, in
[3:27:05.480 --> 3:27:11.000]  a lot of ways are misguided by a modern culture and thinking that to be a real man, it means to
[3:27:11.000 --> 3:27:17.560]  go out there and just be promiscuous and do all of these, you know, right? And not look at the
[3:27:17.560 --> 3:27:23.400]  culture in rap music, for example, the same way in punk rock to probably right 100%. You're
[3:27:23.400 --> 3:27:29.080]  absolutely right. And again, why I believe sometimes God sends misfits, Alex, and here I
[3:27:29.080 --> 3:27:36.760]  am. It's and when I speak to young people and I have the wonderful opportunity, I've been meeting a
[3:27:36.760 --> 3:27:45.960]  lot of men my age who have children. And I talk about the emasculation of Christ, where in in pop
[3:27:45.960 --> 3:27:52.200]  culture, Christ is the lion in the lamb. And unfortunately, we see a lot more of the lamb
[3:27:52.200 --> 3:27:57.800]  than we do the lion where Christ is his great leader of an army that's doing battle. And it
[3:27:57.800 --> 3:28:06.360]  is it's very important to to get that back and say that it's it's okay to to to be this way.
[3:28:06.360 --> 3:28:13.880]  And that it's it's that we have to bring that masculinity back. I totally agree men how to be
[3:28:13.880 --> 3:28:18.600]  and how to live. We should do a whole broadcast system this because the spirit of the world knows
[3:28:18.600 --> 3:28:22.600]  how to trigger things that God already gave us. We fill this energy and this power and the devil
[3:28:22.600 --> 3:28:27.080]  tricks, we will go, Oh, that's the devil. No, ladies and gentlemen, these satanists have no idea
[3:28:27.080 --> 3:28:32.120]  the real power of God and creation and what God's given us. They can't even imagine it.
[3:28:32.120 --> 3:28:37.080]  And so people need to call out to God, not the devil. Matt Brackett's taken over will get into
[3:28:37.080 --> 3:28:40.600]  the coup against the president, the horrible ruling against the Second Amendment more than the

[3:33:14.200 --> 3:33:25.640]  answer to 1984 is 1776 it's matt bracken you're listening to the alex jones show matt bracken
[3:33:25.640 --> 3:33:32.760]  for the rest of the hour and uh i'm going to be into one topic specifically for the next for the
[3:33:32.760 --> 3:33:42.280]  next half hour the rest of the hour and the topic is eric eric sia ramella charamella and why this
[3:33:42.280 --> 3:33:51.160]  guy is so important and why there's such a battle over preserving the his anonymity if in my opinion
[3:33:52.040 --> 3:34:00.040]  charamella is like the lynch pin that would pull pull apart the entire deep state coup pull apart
[3:34:00.040 --> 3:34:08.360]  the entire uh biden ukraine graft corruption conspiracy that's why they've got to come keep
[3:34:08.360 --> 3:34:15.000]  him secret no matter what now people will say but on the internet we've been naming this guy for weeks
[3:34:15.000 --> 3:34:22.440]  now um you know the story the story's been out in uh of when the internet for weeks this is another
[3:34:22.440 --> 3:34:32.360]  aspect of the eric charamella secrecy uh uh flap that's going on the the aspect is does it really
[3:34:32.360 --> 3:34:41.560]  matter what's on the internet as long as it's not on mainstream television news if it can be all over
[3:34:41.560 --> 3:34:51.640]  the internet but if it's not on ab cnn nbcbs and including fox news not even on fox news they're
[3:34:51.640 --> 3:34:58.120]  still embargoing his name on fox news which is really amazing for the last few weeks uh
[3:34:58.120 --> 3:35:03.320]  shawn hannity and others have been chomping at the bit to name the guy so obviously it's coming
[3:35:03.320 --> 3:35:09.640]  down from the from the top floors of fox news that the guy can't be named and why this is
[3:35:09.640 --> 3:35:16.840]  significant is naming this guy would be like firing a battleship broadside at the deep state
[3:35:17.400 --> 3:35:24.040]  so for fox and as we know uh people like like uh paul ryan are now on the board at fox
[3:35:24.040 --> 3:35:31.480]  they're holding fire it's it's um related to the fact that inspector horowitz's
[3:35:32.040 --> 3:35:37.720]  ig report it keeps getting delayed it should have been out months ago but it's not where
[3:35:37.720 --> 3:35:43.800]  is it they're they're allowing the democrats to front load the impeachment hearings starting
[3:35:43.800 --> 3:35:50.600]  tomorrow while holding the holding back the big guns that would be defending trump so they're
[3:35:50.600 --> 3:35:55.880]  they're in essence attempting to leave trump out there without any defenses without any weapons
[3:35:56.440 --> 3:36:01.720]  so that shift and the and the democrat run impeachment inquiry which will be televised
[3:36:02.360 --> 3:36:09.560]  can get off the first broadsides this is sort of a battle to checkmate you know one one team might
[3:36:09.560 --> 3:36:16.520]  feel like they've gotten more players but if if half of your chess pieces are actually traders
[3:36:16.520 --> 3:36:21.720]  and won't move you know that the king can tell the rook please move down the board and take that
[3:36:21.720 --> 3:36:27.640]  bishop but if the rook says screw you i'm not moving or the rook moves in another direction
[3:36:28.200 --> 3:36:34.760]  well then the king is is really hamstrong so even from a weaker position that the democrats have
[3:36:34.760 --> 3:36:40.920]  they can do massive damage because starting tomorrow morning they're going to be on network
[3:36:40.920 --> 3:36:48.040]  television all network television 24 seven and you know wall to wall gavel to gavel it is going
[3:36:48.040 --> 3:36:54.440]  to consume the country now i'm not saying that this is this means that you know we're doomed there's
[3:36:54.440 --> 3:37:00.200]  a lot of really great stuff that i think can happen it's a very strong move that jim jordan
[3:37:00.200 --> 3:37:07.000]  was put on the was put on the um on the intel committee just for the hearings i saw about
[3:37:07.000 --> 3:37:11.960]  an hour or two ago a little segment where shiff came out with the rules for the hearings you
[3:37:11.960 --> 3:37:19.720]  can tell he's very worried under no circumstances may eric sierra mella charamella be named nobody
[3:37:19.720 --> 3:37:25.400]  may even ask about him and there are other things that are that seem a little bit more esoteric but
[3:37:25.400 --> 3:37:33.160]  are very significant the uh republican committee members may not grant their time to other committee
[3:37:33.160 --> 3:37:39.560]  members that is the weak the weak sisters on the intel committee can't just say i'd give my time to
[3:37:39.560 --> 3:37:45.320]  jim jordan so that jordan can just keep hammering and hammering and hammering you know like uh tom
[3:37:45.320 --> 3:37:50.280]  brady going down the field in the fourth quarter they want to make it so that on every you know
[3:37:50.280 --> 3:37:55.320]  every down there'll have to be a different quarterback you know this is strictly a move
[3:37:55.320 --> 3:38:01.560]  to to um try to attempt to stymie the strongest players on the on the republican intel team
[3:38:01.560 --> 3:38:07.640]  which would be jim jordan in a in a this kind of a close quarters debate so what do i think
[3:38:07.640 --> 3:38:13.560]  is going to happen tomorrow since the republicans are not going to be able to call any witnesses
[3:38:13.560 --> 3:38:20.920]  and they've been told that you can't name or even try to identify charamella there's another way of
[3:38:20.920 --> 3:38:28.760]  doing it which is to to draw a picture of a guy by outlining him you can't say eric charamella but
[3:38:28.760 --> 3:38:36.440]  what you can say is you know were you on the national security council um with a cia person who
[3:38:36.440 --> 3:38:43.160]  has since left and then watch shift you know try to gavel it to a close and keep doing that um
[3:38:43.160 --> 3:38:49.240]  were you on the airplane with vice president biden going to ukraine in this month of 2016
[3:38:49.880 --> 3:38:56.760]  with a national security council member from the cia and then watch shift go crazy because the the
[3:38:56.760 --> 3:39:07.160]  fact is charamella was not only a national security council uh staffer he was a john brennan acolyte
[3:39:07.160 --> 3:39:15.160]  he was a a rising star put into this position because he's a true believer like john brennan
[3:39:15.160 --> 3:39:21.640]  he's an arabist you know like a very islamic sympathizing person going back to his college days
[3:39:21.640 --> 3:39:29.560]  in yale and he's an arab linguist very arab sympathetic and like uh brennan you know i would
[3:39:29.560 --> 3:39:37.160]  just call him a communist so brennan has placed him in important places he was a special assistant
[3:39:37.160 --> 3:39:43.480]  to obama himself he was a special assistant to biden for all things ukraine he kind of reminds me of
[3:39:43.480 --> 3:39:50.200]  peter struck he's one of these people whose responsibility um goes way beyond his pay grade
[3:39:50.200 --> 3:39:56.280]  you know one of these rising stars sometimes uh the older the older generals the older the older
[3:39:56.280 --> 3:40:01.960]  senior executive service got grade guys the scs guys they're kind of running out of steam they're
[3:40:01.960 --> 3:40:07.720]  still power mad they're still you know lusting for power but they're running out of steam so when
[3:40:07.720 --> 3:40:13.160]  they find a guy who's like that that hot young first round draft pick quarterback they want to
[3:40:13.160 --> 3:40:21.960]  put him in the game and kind of draft off of his energy so a guy like eric charamella becomes
[3:40:21.960 --> 3:40:29.240]  literally like a peter struck but still hidden now when peter struck and and uh uh lisa page
[3:40:29.240 --> 3:40:34.920]  were chatting with each other texting with each other they were they were mentioning somebody named
[3:40:34.920 --> 3:40:41.160]  charlie who was their man in the white house you know we should we go back to charlie or
[3:40:41.160 --> 3:40:48.120]  is charlie ready to break this story well it's it's a logical deduction that their man charlie
[3:40:48.120 --> 3:40:54.520]  in the white house is eric charamella which is interesting because is the first three letters
[3:40:54.520 --> 3:41:01.240]  of his name is cia i mean you can't make that up but it's pronounced like charlie charamella
[3:41:01.240 --> 3:41:08.440]  so in the in the like loose kind of uh lover code between struck and page they refer to a
[3:41:08.440 --> 3:41:16.040]  their man charlie in the white house so we know that that struck was not only an fbi special agent
[3:41:16.040 --> 3:41:22.360]  or a senior senior um you know sES guy a special assistant or whatever he was a very high level
[3:41:22.360 --> 3:41:29.560]  headquarters guy especially for his age not only that he was working directly with brennan in the
[3:41:29.560 --> 3:41:35.560]  small group the interagency group so there's a little clique put together by john brennan
[3:41:35.560 --> 3:41:43.960]  that includes state department fbi cia and news media like these these uh these you know totally
[3:41:43.960 --> 3:41:52.680]  discredited scoundrels like ignatius at the washington post um it's a cough uh devlin barrett
[3:41:52.680 --> 3:41:59.480]  these are stooges stuzzy stooges that pose as reporters but they work directly to leak for
[3:41:59.480 --> 3:42:07.000]  these deep state cia operatives and i i call it all cia now because clearly the fbi was working
[3:42:07.000 --> 3:42:15.080]  under brennan and uh week week ago week before i um i interviewed for a white hat c uh cia guy
[3:42:15.080 --> 3:42:21.560]  former uh a former chief of station pretty high ranking operator you know actual on the on the
[3:42:21.560 --> 3:42:27.880]  ground cia guy he says brennan is still running the cia from outside this is why he never lost
[3:42:27.880 --> 3:42:35.320]  his security clearance so jenna haspel and the the next two or three below her are all brennan
[3:42:35.320 --> 3:42:40.840]  people you know and of course the left will say yeah well trump trump nominated her i mean she's
[3:42:40.840 --> 3:42:46.120]  trump's person she's trump's pick but that's not really what happened and when we come back after
[3:42:46.120 --> 3:42:54.200]  the break i'm gonna continue with this dissection of the coup info wars life has done it again

[3:47:45.480 --> 3:47:52.120]  free this free program i mean there is a war on for your mind literally and we are the foot soldiers
[3:47:52.120 --> 3:47:58.760]  in this war and at the end of the segment i'm going to have some ideas about how every viewer every
[3:47:58.760 --> 3:48:06.120]  info warrior can actually make a strong impact over the next few days and and some of these ideas i
[3:48:06.120 --> 3:48:11.320]  hope other people already have if not maybe you'll be hearing them for the first time but it's
[3:48:11.320 --> 3:48:17.800]  but it's important that this message get transmitted and then the action plan at the end be carried out
[3:48:18.360 --> 3:48:24.120]  now at the end of the last segment i was talking about how people will say well look you know if
[3:48:24.120 --> 3:48:29.000]  if uh trump is is having problems with the cia it's his own fault because he nominated gene
[3:48:29.000 --> 3:48:35.480]  haspel but that's not really how it works you have to understand when trump came in there was
[3:48:35.480 --> 3:48:41.640]  like a cordon put around him everybody all of the legit players in washington were warned if you
[3:48:41.640 --> 3:48:47.480]  work for trump you're dead you're i mean your career is dead you'll you'll never get a job
[3:48:47.480 --> 3:48:53.640]  anywhere not in academia not with corporate boards you'll be a pariah so they they put this
[3:48:54.280 --> 3:48:59.640]  like a dead zone around trump made made it very very hard for him to recruit top caliber people
[3:48:59.640 --> 3:49:07.240]  so when people were suggested as being you know a good a good player like a rod rosinstein he's
[3:49:07.240 --> 3:49:14.920]  like okay he sounds good to me um or a gene haspel why not she comes highly recommended and uh and
[3:49:14.920 --> 3:49:20.920]  you know these these uh high players high ranking players are telling me she's good so i'll nominate
[3:49:20.920 --> 3:49:26.680]  her and and importantly he's told oh she'll have no problem getting through senate confirmation
[3:49:26.680 --> 3:49:34.920]  and that's all because they wanted her there so to say that gene haspel is trump's choice is really
[3:49:34.920 --> 3:49:41.640]  is is really uh uh not really telling the true story that's how they get these deep state operatives
[3:49:41.640 --> 3:49:48.440]  to continue to surround him in the news just recently the last couple days is um rex tillerson
[3:49:48.440 --> 3:49:54.120]  and general kelly also working against trump and in the past we've seen many others and of
[3:49:54.120 --> 3:50:01.640]  course at a lower level this um uh kernel vindman uh eric cherimela these are all plants that are
[3:50:01.640 --> 3:50:07.960]  actively working against trump and he's been he's been having some success weeding them out but
[3:50:07.960 --> 3:50:15.320]  it's taken three years he's lost most of his of his um uh term just trying to fight this octopus
[3:50:15.320 --> 3:50:21.000]  so he's like been surrounded by a love octopus you know people all the tentacles of this octopus
[3:50:21.000 --> 3:50:26.840]  come in acting like they they're his friend that they're on his side and he has to has to unweave
[3:50:26.840 --> 3:50:32.680]  and untangle and chop off these octopus arms one at a time to try to find people that he can trust
[3:50:33.400 --> 3:50:40.040]  and and he's having some success but there is a race right now because the first salvos are
[3:50:40.040 --> 3:50:45.240]  going to be fired tomorrow with a you know a wall-to-wall national television audience
[3:50:45.240 --> 3:50:51.400]  once meanwhile at the state or department of justice and fbi they're holding up i g
[3:50:51.400 --> 3:50:57.320]  horowitz's report and that's like keeping your battleship out of the battle so trump's about
[3:50:57.320 --> 3:51:03.880]  to take take a broadside tomorrow and the conservative republican guns are spiking
[3:51:03.880 --> 3:51:08.920]  their own guns to not get in the fight to help him it's it's pretty discouraging but
[3:51:09.560 --> 3:51:14.440]  there's another way also of looking at this and and this is and i'm going to make it kind
[3:51:14.440 --> 3:51:20.040]  of an interesting war comparison if you've seen the movie or any of the history the battle of
[3:51:20.040 --> 3:51:26.440]  the bulge in world war two in december of 1944 when the allies were finally having some good
[3:51:26.440 --> 3:51:33.960]  success getting into belgium had taken most of france on the way in way to germany instead of
[3:51:33.960 --> 3:51:39.960]  husbanding their resources the nazis husbanding their resources for a defensive you know step by
[3:51:39.960 --> 3:51:48.280]  step backwards a movement like they had done in russia they put together a massive offensive
[3:51:48.280 --> 3:51:54.120]  was like a last-ditch play and it was an attempt to break through cut the allies in half and get
[3:51:54.120 --> 3:51:59.480]  all the way to antwerp and the belgium ports that was like a desperation play now if you were in
[3:51:59.480 --> 3:52:05.880]  baston in december of 1944 it would have looked like the whole world had come down on you you
[3:52:05.880 --> 3:52:13.160]  know all of these german armored divisions coming at you but in fact they had no fuel when they
[3:52:13.160 --> 3:52:19.480]  ran out of gas the offensive died right where where the the tanks ran out of fuel and that's
[3:52:19.480 --> 3:52:26.680]  the situation today that the democrats find themselves in so bird doing doing the uh
[3:52:26.680 --> 3:52:33.800]  the ukraine gate starting with eric charamella as the whistleblower to me is like the german
[3:52:33.800 --> 3:52:41.080]  battle of the bulge it's literally burning their networks for one last victory you know they they
[3:52:41.080 --> 3:52:47.000]  had kept these guys secret all along the fact you know not only the high-ranking people like you
[3:52:47.000 --> 3:52:53.480]  know the the tillersons and the kelly's in the hassles but they had they had way more people
[3:52:53.480 --> 3:53:00.200]  at a lower level in the white house like colonel vinman eric charamella the others that went from
[3:53:00.200 --> 3:53:07.960]  nsc over to um shifts committee intel committee and and what they've done in effect by using
[3:53:07.960 --> 3:53:13.800]  charamella as the whistleblower was exposed their network they've burned their network it can't be
[3:53:13.800 --> 3:53:20.200]  used again this is a do or die play in the impeachment inquiry so if this doesn't work
[3:53:20.760 --> 3:53:28.520]  then they've got nothing left and their network will be exposed so the thing to do now is to assist
[3:53:28.520 --> 3:53:35.720]  to the the the the freedom caucus brave guys on the intel committee the jim jordans we have to
[3:53:35.720 --> 3:53:43.400]  assist them on the outside by completely blowing up the secrecy around eric charamella this is going
[3:53:43.400 --> 3:53:49.480]  to make shift look like an idiot because inside the committee jim jordan and the others will be
[3:53:49.480 --> 3:53:54.520]  doing everything they can to throw darts all around the portrait of eric charamella without
[3:53:54.520 --> 3:54:00.680]  actually naming him and outside there's going to be a lot of street theater and i hope that some of
[3:54:00.680 --> 3:54:07.160]  the you know our best info warriors i trust are going to be up there and actually getting the name
[3:54:07.160 --> 3:54:14.200]  eric charamella on the cameras where the network can't avoid it i saw at the lsu alabama game
[3:54:14.200 --> 3:54:20.920]  they were uh some uh i guess abc cbs doesn't matter reporter was asking some maga hat wears
[3:54:20.920 --> 3:54:26.440]  what they why they still like trump and somebody stuck right in there epstein didn't kill himself
[3:54:27.080 --> 3:54:32.760]  that's what we've need to do with the name of eric charamella you know epstein's important
[3:54:32.760 --> 3:54:39.960]  but he's dead but eric charamella is very much a player and they're trying to keep him secret
[3:54:39.960 --> 3:54:45.800]  while they're launching all their broadsides at trump in this bogus inquiry we need to keep
[3:54:45.800 --> 3:54:53.080]  the eric charamella story going and if you're up in washington you if you get anywhere around a
[3:54:53.080 --> 3:54:59.640]  network tv camera the name eric charamella is the whistleblower that's got to be something that they
[3:54:59.640 --> 3:55:04.920]  have to keep cutting away from it's gonna it's going to make the democrats inside the committee
[3:55:04.920 --> 3:55:10.680]  that would be shift he'll be batting down all of the republicans that are trying to draw a picture
[3:55:10.680 --> 3:55:16.600]  of charamella without naming him and outside on the street the networks are going to have to keep
[3:55:16.600 --> 3:55:22.760]  swerving their cameras away from big signs saying eric charamella is the whistleblower i mean the
[3:55:22.760 --> 3:55:29.320]  guy worked for john brennan he worked for susan rice he it's believed he was on the airplane with
[3:55:29.320 --> 3:55:35.080]  joe biden when they're flying over to ukraine doing all of their dirty dealings with the money
[3:55:35.080 --> 3:55:41.000]  going to hunter biden i mean he is not a nobody and the fact that they're trying to hide him
[3:55:41.000 --> 3:55:47.640]  tells me it's really important on sunday howie curts has a show called media buzz like sunday
[3:55:47.640 --> 3:55:55.320]  morning it's a so-so show molly hemmingway from the federalist was on and so was a guy named on
[3:55:55.320 --> 3:56:03.080]  the panel a guy named philly bay ray and s uh who was a hillary clinton senior state department
[3:56:03.080 --> 3:56:11.960]  advisor he's a real pasty weasley uh soy you know middle-aged soyboy type of guy and molly hemmingway
[3:56:11.960 --> 3:56:18.200]  in the discussion the segment was actually about should the whistleblower be named molly hemmingway
[3:56:18.200 --> 3:56:21.960]  said i don't know why we're even having this discussion his name's been all over the internet
[3:56:21.960 --> 3:56:28.920]  for weeks and he's she said uh real clear politics has put his you know it says he's eric charamella
[3:56:28.920 --> 3:56:34.520]  well howie curts and philly bay rayness they looked like they had strokes and they couldn't
[3:56:34.520 --> 3:56:40.840]  believe it philly bay rayness said that might be the first time that the name has been mentioned
[3:56:40.840 --> 3:56:48.040]  on fox news he didn't say unname he said the name so it's a big joke in a sense because at the network
[3:56:48.040 --> 3:56:53.960]  level they all know who eric charamella is that's why i'm making these memes you know about the uh
[3:56:53.960 --> 3:56:59.720]  valdemort or the soviet disappearing you know that guy next to stall and that disappears it's
[3:56:59.720 --> 3:57:05.880]  super important that we just push the name eric charamella in in front of every network
[3:57:05.880 --> 3:57:12.440]  camera and there's going to be cameras everywhere around washington tomorrow if you want a good
[3:57:12.440 --> 3:57:18.120]  laugh try to find that media buzz um show from sunday it's been scrubbed from the internet just
[3:57:18.120 --> 3:57:24.680]  about completely but if you know the the media the network cameras are going to be out in force
[3:57:24.680 --> 3:57:32.040]  all week and we need to just have signs buttons you know shout it so that the media has to look
[3:57:32.040 --> 3:57:38.040]  like the soviet media trying to shut down the news anyway thanks for being with me and i think
[3:57:38.040 --> 3:57:49.080]  that's all the time i've got today and i'll see you the next chance that i get
