[00:00.000 --> 00:11.680]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[00:11.680 --> 00:27.080]  It is Thursday my friends the 31st day of May 2018 we're gonna be live here for the
[00:27.080 --> 00:36.520]  next four hours as we are every weekday that I return Sundays 4 to 6 p.m. this
[00:36.520 --> 00:42.920]  vote by the Congress after decades of them trying to pass it and Trump signing
[00:42.920 --> 00:48.560]  it yesterday of the right to try act is incredibly illustrative of the true
[00:48.560 --> 00:54.160]  spirit of the Democrats who want a bunch of hopeless slaves the fact that they
[00:54.160 --> 01:01.600]  would openly push government-funded assisted suicide of people that want to
[01:01.600 --> 01:08.520]  die state-controlled euthanasia but are against people who are terminal being
[01:08.520 --> 01:15.280]  able to fight for their lives is 110 percent illustrative of their mindset
[01:15.280 --> 01:19.760]  and their coat and who they are we're gonna look at that today and some of
[01:19.760 --> 01:25.320]  their statements and then the statements of MSNBC CNBC and CNN just all saying
[01:25.320 --> 01:31.880]  Trump is a racist Trump is a demon Trump is a bad guy this is this is all
[01:31.880 --> 01:38.360]  they've got over and over and over again when Trump clearly cares about people
[01:38.360 --> 01:42.440]  across the board and is trying to bring common sense and prosperity back it's
[01:42.440 --> 01:49.760]  amazing he's just arrived in Houston and he's going to be speaking there with
[01:49.760 --> 01:53.760]  victims and family members of the tragic Santa Fe shooting a few weeks ago
[01:53.760 --> 01:58.560]  we're going to be covering all of that live we have our own satellite feed of
[01:58.560 --> 02:06.360]  that so we'll be breaking it all down and we're also going to have Owen
[02:06.360 --> 02:11.400]  shroyer in studio he is going to go out and lead a demonstration outside Planned
[02:11.400 --> 02:15.760]  Parenthood to point out with the real mass murders going on yeah you've got
[02:15.760 --> 02:21.080]  between 46 and 56 it varies here to your the average but it's never above 60
[02:21.080 --> 02:24.360]  people killed in mass shootings at school so that's too many and it's a new
[02:24.360 --> 02:30.080]  phenomenon since 1999 but the media hyping it psychologists admit creates
[02:30.080 --> 02:34.320]  this idea mentally ill people that it's a an option because they want to be
[02:34.320 --> 02:38.640]  famous they want to get attention and we have the most sickening footage ever on
[02:38.640 --> 02:44.000]  info wars.com I'm going to play it from the Broward County state attorney's
[02:44.000 --> 02:48.840]  office so an info wars.com I'm gonna retweet it right now in real Alex Jones
[02:48.840 --> 02:54.360]  you want to see it you just see the true face of evil and why we have guns to
[02:54.360 --> 02:58.640]  protect ourselves from these type of folks we can't let these demons engaging
[02:58.640 --> 03:02.520]  in the bizarre sickening mass murder whether you they're using a baseball
[03:02.520 --> 03:09.440]  batter a knife or a truck or explosives or firearms we can't then penalize the
[03:09.440 --> 03:13.200]  rest of the population shock footage Nicholas Cruz vows to shoot up school
[03:13.200 --> 03:18.240]  you're all gonna die says Parkland gunman he bragged about this for years
[03:18.240 --> 03:23.040]  you're gonna see the sickening and hear the sickening daemon the golem like
[03:23.040 --> 03:28.840]  gremlin like on serotonin rip taken habitors been in government custody for
[03:28.840 --> 03:34.360]  years but in foster care his whole life parents were dead foster parents he was
[03:34.360 --> 03:40.080]  in a promise program where he could threaten and steal and rob and vandalize
[03:40.080 --> 03:42.760]  however he wanted he was he was in the liberal program was his last name was
[03:42.760 --> 03:49.760]  Cruz you know he's not Hispanic was adopted family was Hispanic and he was
[03:49.760 --> 03:52.960]  allowed to do it and the sheriff's department stood down and did it he
[03:52.960 --> 03:56.880]  wondered the media talk about that now the police stand down over and over and
[03:56.880 --> 04:01.680]  over again in blue state areas no you'll just hear misrepresentations about
[04:01.680 --> 04:05.760]  what really happened that said there's six or seven people have access to my
[04:05.760 --> 04:11.400]  Twitter and we've contacted the folks in the office and no one did it so we have
[04:11.400 --> 04:16.520]  to change the codes this this shows how deep the manipulation is going there's
[04:16.520 --> 04:23.200]  news articles out there from twitchy and others wow so owned Kyle cash of drops
[04:23.200 --> 04:30.120]  Alex Jones in just five words and all is right with the world and so someone
[04:30.120 --> 04:36.200]  saying they were me barely know that Kyle cash you've got is I can't understand
[04:36.200 --> 04:41.040]  that these tweets back and forth and they call this owning me so somebody got
[04:41.040 --> 04:46.160]  the code to my Twitter you always hear about this happening but somebody got it
[04:46.160 --> 04:50.000]  and did this rather than change the codes right now there's there's just no
[04:50.000 --> 04:54.240]  end to the links people will go to like tie me to harassing shooting victims
[04:54.240 --> 04:57.640]  it's just all part of the narrative they push I don't know who's behind this

[06:15.680 --> 06:26.040]  live to the central texas command center and the heart of the resistance is alex
[06:26.040 --> 06:31.920]  jones ladies and gentlemen we are set to probably have the next to susan on the
[06:31.920 --> 06:36.720]  broadcast today he was just pardoned by the president the president announced
[06:36.720 --> 06:41.000]  the pardon when he boarded air force one in dc to fly to houston texas where he's
[06:41.000 --> 06:46.920]  now landed and is going to be visiting with the victims and the survivors and
[06:46.920 --> 06:52.080]  the parents of the tragic santa fe shooting a few weeks ago he's announced
[06:52.080 --> 06:56.480]  a full pardon the next to susan today he was treated very very unfairly by our
[06:56.480 --> 07:00.000]  government absolutely true trump also considering pardon for martha steward
[07:00.000 --> 07:06.240]  whom comey falsely prosecuted in a complete stunt where he protects all
[07:06.240 --> 07:14.360]  the real organized crime but then does these type of persecutions just for pr
[07:14.360 --> 07:18.920]  of someone like martha steward who did absolutely nothing wrong if you look at
[07:18.920 --> 07:27.920]  the next to susan case he got five friends to donate money to a senate
[07:27.920 --> 07:31.040]  candidate that he'd been best friends with in college who was running for
[07:31.040 --> 07:38.720]  hillary clinton's old seat she subsequently lost the person she was
[07:38.720 --> 07:43.640]  running against and then it came out in divorce papers that denation refunded
[07:43.640 --> 07:48.080]  the money to his friends so he talked about a crooked toenail compared to
[07:48.080 --> 07:51.480]  what hillary does and all the hundreds of millions of dollars of laundered
[07:51.480 --> 07:55.680]  money that's confirmed through her foundation it's amazing so that's a
[07:55.680 --> 08:01.280]  good pardon there great pardon we saw with sheriff joe arpaio good to see
[08:01.280 --> 08:07.560]  trump using that power of the executive branch to x out a lot of these
[08:07.560 --> 08:13.920]  travesties of justice that are taking place now there's something very very
[08:13.920 --> 08:19.840]  illustrative of where we stand as a culture in a society and in the hustle
[08:19.840 --> 08:24.720]  and bustle and fast-moving pace of our universe I don't want people to lose sight
[08:24.720 --> 08:29.720]  of what happened yesterday and how you understand this point you understand
[08:29.720 --> 08:36.800]  basically everything about the globalist about leftist about eugenicist about the
[08:36.800 --> 08:40.800]  type of people that push the domestication of populations not to
[08:40.800 --> 08:47.400]  empower them but to enslave them and I'm speaking about the signing of the right
[08:47.400 --> 08:53.800]  to try bill all over the world they push the right to die and I tend to agree
[08:53.800 --> 08:55.960]  that if you don't want to have treatment and just want to die that's your
[08:55.960 --> 09:02.200]  right and quite frankly I could imagine in some really really bad cases where
[09:02.200 --> 09:09.360]  where people I don't blame them commit suicide but you do not want the state
[09:09.360 --> 09:16.080]  ever involved in the implementation of euthanasia because then it becomes a
[09:16.080 --> 09:20.720]  Nazi Germany a way where they just get rid of people and pretty soon it's the
[09:20.720 --> 09:26.600]  mentally retarded it's people that are crippled disabled all the rest of it the
[09:26.600 --> 09:29.560]  left says don't call them crippled call them disabled but they don't want to
[09:29.560 --> 09:35.360]  give them treatment want to kill them in the womb so the left famously wants
[09:35.360 --> 09:44.280]  taxpayers to even pay for state sponsored euthanasia suicide and that they
[09:44.280 --> 09:50.320]  got famous national Dutch television showing well-functioning down syndrome
[09:50.320 --> 09:55.640]  man that he cost the state way more money than the general public does in a
[09:55.640 --> 10:00.120]  socialist type system and then the management to feel bad about himself in
[10:00.120 --> 10:05.960]  Europe's moving to forcibly make you abort down syndrome babies that means
[10:05.960 --> 10:08.400]  government screening of the genetics and the next it's going to be everything
[10:08.400 --> 10:13.720]  else as we know the whole psychiatric tyranny calls even resisting tyranny
[10:13.720 --> 10:19.480]  mental illness so we know the eugenics angle of this we know about the bioethics
[10:19.480 --> 10:22.480]  boards we know about the Thomas AI computers coming in all over the world
[10:22.480 --> 10:26.560]  to take over healthcare and so Trump comes in and says well if you're already
[10:26.560 --> 10:32.840]  terminal and your stage four cancer or Lou Gehrig's or ALS or any of these
[10:32.840 --> 10:40.080]  things and you choose to be able to take a treatment that that may have bad
[10:40.080 --> 10:46.760]  side effects that may even kill you you have a right to do that and big pharma
[10:46.760 --> 10:49.440]  is the one that wrote the laws like this to keep your competition from coming
[10:49.440 --> 10:52.800]  in and also make sure there aren't treatments way better than their
[10:52.800 --> 10:56.480]  treatments and even cures available and that's well documented everybody knows
[10:56.480 --> 11:02.520]  about suppressed technology not just the medical area now that said what Trump
[11:02.520 --> 11:07.440]  did and I've looked at the bill if anything isn't strong enough he said
[11:07.440 --> 11:11.520]  that too he said it still be average of two three years for a lot of things to
[11:11.520 --> 11:15.840]  get approved and he said but this will at least allow people that are terminal
[11:15.840 --> 11:19.440]  to be able to go through the process of seeing if it works and helps them and
[11:19.440 --> 11:24.400]  then yes by being volunteer guinea pigs quite frankly dedicating their bodies
[11:24.400 --> 11:27.840]  to science while they're still alive they will then undoubtedly save
[11:27.840 --> 11:33.240]  potentially millions of people in one breakthrough alone globally and so the
[11:33.240 --> 11:36.680]  US is way behind on medicine we used to be the forefront because of these rules
[11:36.680 --> 11:39.640]  the last 30 years that were put in there to hamper us part of the global
[11:39.640 --> 11:45.800]  sabotage which is in their own admissions but the left's hissing hateful
[11:45.800 --> 11:50.720]  disgusting responses of calling him a racist and saying he wants to be guinea
[11:50.720 --> 11:55.120]  pig people without their knowledge or that he wants to kill people is so
[11:55.120 --> 11:59.480]  criminal they want you hopeless they want you alone they don't want real
[11:59.480 --> 12:04.840]  progress because the elites can go to their own you know offshore swish
[12:04.840 --> 12:09.040]  medical facilities and others and they really want a regressive health care
[12:09.040 --> 12:13.320]  system not a progressive one that's why under the National Health Service a
[12:13.320 --> 12:19.600]  little girl has a leg four inches shorter it's about a 5,000 pound I kept
[12:19.600 --> 12:24.360]  saying dollar about a 5,000 pound that's about $8,000 surgery and they just said
[12:24.360 --> 12:31.000]  no we'll just cut your leg off so oh if you want to get a sex change or
[12:31.000 --> 12:34.680]  hormone treatment for a five-year-old boy thinks he's a girl we'll pay for that
[12:34.680 --> 12:37.600]  the National Health Service or you know liberal areas like San Francisco will
[12:37.600 --> 12:41.400]  but if you want your leg fixed sweetheart we're gonna cut it off or if you
[12:41.400 --> 12:46.600]  want to have life-saving experimental treatments we're not gonna let you do
[12:46.600 --> 12:51.680]  that so it's it's all this virtue signaling but it's true evil so an
[12:51.680 --> 13:00.120]  article is is is up on info wars dot com I've got a stack of news articles here
[13:00.120 --> 13:06.280]  that basically go over it but here's one of the headlines dims attack Trump
[13:06.280 --> 13:11.480]  resigning right to try drug bill into law and it's got a bunch of examples the
[13:11.480 --> 13:14.640]  Democratic Party they voted against it and the House and Senate along party
[13:14.640 --> 13:19.400]  lines Democrat side with FDA over terminal patients that's how the Mises
[13:19.400 --> 13:24.280]  Institute that's endorsed what the president did it's it's just crazy
[13:24.280 --> 13:29.520]  despite skepticism family behind right to try law hopeful it will save lives I
[13:29.520 --> 13:35.640]  mean this is insane the government can kill you if your terminal or even if
[13:35.640 --> 13:40.600]  you're depressed and we'll have taxpayers pay for it in some areas some
[13:40.600 --> 13:46.400]  states and Europe pushes it but if you're dying think about this and you
[13:46.400 --> 13:52.320]  want to take an experimental drug there the left doesn't want to let you
[13:52.320 --> 13:56.560]  universally across the world because they're control freaks they're
[13:56.560 --> 14:03.560]  inherently evil so we're gonna look at all that more today it's simply amazing
[14:03.560 --> 14:07.920]  and then we have the most chilling disgusting frightening demonic footage
[14:07.920 --> 14:12.600]  but it's got to be heard it's got to be seen of shocking statements by Nicholas
[14:12.600 --> 14:16.360]  Cruz released last night they're on info wars dot com two minute video talk
[14:16.360 --> 14:19.720]  about what he was gonna do this is the true face of evil and why we have guys
[14:19.720 --> 14:23.000]  to protect ourselves they stood down they knew what the monster was planning
[14:23.000 --> 14:26.920]  they stood down on every level he was on drugs government issued drugs he was
[14:26.920 --> 14:29.840]  in a liberal program where he could commit crimes called the promise program
[14:29.840 --> 14:33.200]  and not locked up he was known as the school shooter he constantly threatened
[14:33.200 --> 14:37.080]  everyone he took toy guns the schools and threatened to kill them and they
[14:37.080 --> 14:42.320]  stood down again and then blamed all gun owners and then lied and said that I
[14:42.320 --> 14:46.520]  said no one died at Parkland and that they were all crisis actors and the
[14:46.520 --> 14:49.880]  media ran with more lives of that today this is the true evil but you heard what
[14:49.880 --> 14:53.800]  I really said now we're gonna go to break and come back with the Nick Cruz
[14:53.800 --> 14:57.360]  footage as soon as Trump gets with the families we'll go to that live as well

[20:31.280 --> 20:37.120]  there's an article out it's up on info wars.com out of the hill Obama
[20:37.120 --> 20:42.600]  compared Trump to a cartoon shortly after the election he also said you know
[20:42.600 --> 20:47.640]  Trump can't get the economy up above 2.9 percent just Obama couldn't he said
[20:47.640 --> 20:53.120]  what are you gonna do wave a magic wand no he just removed some of the
[20:53.120 --> 20:57.800]  artificial barriers there that no other country had on itself that tilted the
[20:57.800 --> 21:04.480]  playing field against us with an uphill battle and even the Washington Post has
[21:04.480 --> 21:09.440]  to admit today in a headline thank Trump and thank the Republicans for the
[21:09.440 --> 21:14.200]  right to try bill it's gonna save really millions of lives because it's gonna
[21:14.200 --> 21:17.920]  find a lot of cures on people that are already terminal have no other choice and
[21:17.920 --> 21:22.960]  it'll help a lot of them but it also will let us know with human trials
[21:22.960 --> 21:27.520]  accelerated what is going to help others that can mean your daughter your son
[21:27.520 --> 21:31.160]  your father your mother your brother your sister your aunt your uncle your
[21:31.160 --> 21:39.440]  neighbor your pastor your friend your lover and it's nothing but a good thing
[21:39.440 --> 21:45.040]  a free choice because I don't like suicide and I don't like endorsing it
[21:45.040 --> 21:49.200]  because the state gets involved and that's evil but you can't be a hypocrite
[21:49.200 --> 21:53.600]  about folks that commit suicide because they're in great pain well if you're
[21:53.600 --> 21:59.280]  gonna have a right to die you gotta have a right to fight right to try and it's
[21:59.280 --> 22:07.040]  so incredibly illustrative now let's move into something that I want to just
[22:07.040 --> 22:18.240]  say viewer discretion is advised there's no profanity but it's so chilling and so
[22:18.240 --> 22:26.760]  sickening and so pathetically weak that it puts a chill in my bones it puts a
[22:26.760 --> 22:31.320]  nauseous feeling in the pit of my stomach but I'm going to air this because
[22:31.320 --> 22:37.000]  this is why we have guns this is why we have a right to self-defense mass
[22:37.000 --> 22:43.760]  shootings that not exist in schools until 1999 you had a few gang related
[22:43.760 --> 22:47.520]  things here and there but that was it you know people going to purposely kill a
[22:47.520 --> 22:55.920]  bunch of people to get their name in the news and be killed now even mainline
[22:55.920 --> 23:00.840]  psychologists and psychiatrists are on record you have the same MO you have in
[23:00.840 --> 23:07.080]  cells that don't feel like girls like them they're into violent shoot them up
[23:07.080 --> 23:11.560]  games which habituate them to killing shoot them up games were invented during
[23:11.560 --> 23:15.920]  Vietnam to get people to shoot folks up close about half the troops wouldn't do
[23:15.920 --> 23:20.680]  it up close about 10% would shoot somebody to thousand yards just couldn't do
[23:20.680 --> 23:25.360]  it they miss on purpose they would hesitate at the key moment they would be
[23:25.360 --> 23:33.960]  dead marine quote full metal jacket but in this case with crews and in every
[23:33.960 --> 23:37.000]  other case they're on serotonin reuptake inhibitors that's been confirmed
[23:37.000 --> 23:42.160]  about him he was in government foster homes his whole life he was in a promise
[23:42.160 --> 23:45.560]  program protecting him where he could do whatever he wanted commit crimes
[23:45.560 --> 23:52.200]  commit burglaries commit assaults commit vandalism he was protected since
[23:52.200 --> 24:01.720]  2013 four plus years to do whatever he wanted and so he built this up as he
[24:01.720 --> 24:05.080]  has identity he was known at the school as the school shooter he kept
[24:05.080 --> 24:08.320]  threatening it for years that's on record the police were called more than
[24:08.320 --> 24:13.960]  20 times the FBI three times they stood down that day the main security
[24:13.960 --> 24:17.480]  officer who was over the training where they had drills the month before he
[24:17.480 --> 24:24.720]  stood down he just gets his $8,700 a month starting this month 37 39 times
[24:24.720 --> 24:29.440]  excuse me I was saying 20 something here and three here it was it was it was 39
[24:29.440 --> 24:34.680]  times let's put that back on screen for TV viewers please CBS Miami 39 times
[24:34.680 --> 24:40.560]  law enforcement with the nickels cruises home 39 times so this is the guy we need
[24:40.560 --> 24:45.800]  to institutionalize or execute but no no no no no the left at every level enabled
[24:45.800 --> 24:49.200]  and protected and stood down and put him on the drugs and put him in
[24:49.200 --> 24:52.400]  psychiatric care and turned him loose when he said I'm gonna kill people and
[24:52.400 --> 24:57.200]  then he got a gun illegally magically and he goes and attacks the school where
[24:57.200 --> 25:01.640]  they stand down now what do they want to change the subject and claim that I
[25:01.640 --> 25:06.400]  said nobody died there I never said that that's a lie and they know it they
[25:06.400 --> 25:11.320]  want to change the subject how they create these mass murder zones but you
[25:11.320 --> 25:18.200]  listen to the fried brain you listen to the gibbering evil of someone's brain
[25:18.200 --> 25:22.880]  whacked out you know they say 75% of foster kids are on serotonin reuptake
[25:22.880 --> 25:28.320]  inhibitors you listen to this whacked out brain this demon this demon possessed
[25:28.320 --> 25:32.320]  golem creature the product of the liberals and their and their program of
[25:32.320 --> 25:37.040]  appeasement and of their promised program with a government stand down at
[25:37.040 --> 25:42.000]  every level at the place they advertise for killers to go and he says I'm gonna
[25:42.000 --> 25:46.440]  be somebody I'm gonna go in this is my day get ready gleefully knowing that
[25:46.440 --> 25:50.920]  nobody's gonna be there to stop him gleefully knowing that they've had drill
[25:50.920 --> 25:56.240]  so he can observe how to do it and how to take action and this is his demonic
[25:56.240 --> 26:01.440]  attack on us and then the real demons the Democratic Party in the media they
[26:01.440 --> 26:05.320]  then use this to project it on good Americans and tell us we're to blame for
[26:05.320 --> 26:09.640]  their Frankenstein Nicholas Cruz here is the sickening truth

[34:43.080 --> 34:46.800]  sir what about MS-13 killing everybody goes yes they're animals they're
[34:46.800 --> 34:52.880]  literal devil worshipers they do devil worship rituals so it's animals don't do
[34:52.880 --> 34:58.160]  stuff just to be mean most the time I'd say he's MS-13 is worse than animals
[34:58.160 --> 35:01.880]  Trump is wrong so Owen's got a big announcement here that the ties into the
[35:01.880 --> 35:05.520]  mass shootings and save people's lives and the fact that they're gonna be a
[35:05.520 --> 35:12.600]  bunch of executions taking place at below preschool level they're gonna be
[35:12.600 --> 35:16.840]  thousands of children executed today and tomorrow we're gonna tell you about
[35:16.840 --> 35:21.440]  that here in just a moment but the media doesn't humanize them they don't like
[35:21.440 --> 35:26.160]  they now plan paranoid says that a heartbeat is not life so we're gonna be
[35:26.160 --> 35:30.320]  looking at all that here in a moment but first if you want to help us go through
[35:30.320 --> 35:34.720]  the storm and take everybody else with us through the storm because we are the
[35:34.720 --> 35:39.000]  main enemy of the globalist there's an official article in Reuters today
[35:39.000 --> 35:43.160]  saying that they need a Peter Thiel to back the quote destruction of info wars
[35:43.160 --> 35:48.000]  and they actually lie about me with malice of forethought with intent to
[35:48.000 --> 35:52.400]  do harm misrepresent what I've said and done to then destroy me so this is a
[35:52.400 --> 35:57.000]  very definition of true malice of forethought intent to do harm by Reuters
[35:57.000 --> 36:03.240]  now has their editorial board coming out and then totally notice no video
[36:03.240 --> 36:08.160]  links no clips no actual quotes of me nothing but pure deception saying I'm
[36:08.160 --> 36:12.320]  currently never was bullying Sandy Hook parents currently sitting people to
[36:12.320 --> 36:16.640]  harass them never did that currently saying nobody died when all I did was
[36:16.640 --> 36:19.120]  look at both sides of it which people have a right to do it's an American's
[36:19.120 --> 36:23.840]  blood the question Gulf of Tonkin JFK any other stuff but now the media goes
[36:23.840 --> 36:27.760]  further and says that I say each new thing never happened and everybody's
[36:27.760 --> 36:32.000]  crisis actors and it's a lie it's a fraud and it's going to come out but that's
[36:32.000 --> 36:36.560]  it why are they after us because they understand we've got their numbers so if
[36:36.560 --> 36:43.400]  you want to stand against the globalist we don't have a George Soros you are our
[36:43.400 --> 36:46.440]  George Soros the American people people the world so I want to thank you all many

[38:30.240 --> 38:34.240]  life.com or triple eight two five three three one three nine but here's the
[38:34.240 --> 38:39.960]  deal they're targeting us show I'm proud of that I know we're over the target I
[38:39.960 --> 38:42.680]  know we're changing the world we're rebooting Americana renaissance
[38:42.680 --> 38:46.720]  Trump's delivering with you know something to say millions of people in
[38:46.720 --> 38:49.640]  the aggregate not just with those that get saved with experimental treatments
[38:49.640 --> 38:54.320]  or have their lives extended for you know more time or feel better there's a
[38:54.320 --> 38:58.080]  lot of treatments thousands of them that have been suppressed but also now that
[38:58.080 --> 39:01.840]  this will then allow the acceleration of discovering what works best for
[39:01.840 --> 39:06.320]  everybody else so these people are really hitting the bar bar for us then and
[39:06.320 --> 39:09.000]  of course overwhelmingly people that are terminally ill want experimental
[39:09.000 --> 39:11.840]  treatments they can't get here they got to go to Germany or other places
[39:11.840 --> 39:15.600]  Switzerland so this is nothing but a win-win the fact the left so upset shows
[39:15.600 --> 39:20.360]  their pro-death so I got to say I got mad at Trump about Syria he's not perfect
[39:20.360 --> 39:23.880]  but he knows what he's doing on North Korea on the economy on 4% growth rates
[39:23.880 --> 39:27.560]  about to be announced on these great pardons of Anastasia Suza, Martha Stewart
[39:27.560 --> 39:31.480]  he's talking about with the jobs coming back how much the globalist hating how
[39:31.480 --> 39:35.120]  he's getting good Supreme Court judges and good judges in this is a death
[39:35.120 --> 39:40.000]  reprieve for America and you can see it and feel it and you can see Trump's
[39:40.000 --> 39:43.480]  beginning to turn the corner he's beginning to win his beachhead is
[39:43.480 --> 39:48.560]  expanding the swamp is beginning to drain and this is absolutely because our
[39:48.560 --> 39:51.840]  ancestors were Christian many of them and because they prayed for Providence
[39:51.840 --> 39:55.360]  and we're living off their providence so I want to thank my ancestors I want to
[39:55.360 --> 39:59.680]  thank all you the listeners and I am just buoyed by this and but we are
[39:59.680 --> 40:04.560]  going over the top it means there's big fights to come I'm getting good chills
[40:04.560 --> 40:08.880]  right now not the sickening chills I had playing that horrible clip so I want
[40:08.880 --> 40:12.240]  shroyers here we're gonna get into the big demonstration and what he's
[40:12.240 --> 40:15.920]  launching tomorrow that I hope you'll be part of here in Austin to illustrate
[40:15.920 --> 40:19.960]  things but you saw that sickening Nick Cruz video shot on his cell phone
[40:19.960 --> 40:24.680]  retrieved by police about how he was gonna love killing everybody in the
[40:24.680 --> 40:28.400]  total darkness and the evil clearly he's been on Prozac type drugs his whole
[40:28.400 --> 40:32.240]  life he's been under their control and programmed by the computers constant
[40:32.240 --> 40:35.120]  interruptions from smartphones can impact brain chemistry scientists say
[40:35.120 --> 40:39.720]  that CBS news it is it is disassociating us well the average person
[40:39.720 --> 40:43.520]  becomes a disassociated sociopath they're not psychotic but you take
[40:43.520 --> 40:46.840]  somebody like this and put them into a culture of bullying shoot them up video
[40:46.840 --> 40:52.160]  games serotonin reuptake inhibitors it's always the same formula well and I
[40:52.160 --> 40:56.080]  couldn't believe that video and you take a look at what we know from leaked
[40:56.080 --> 41:00.200]  government documents when it comes to the effect of cell phones and the radio
[41:00.200 --> 41:03.520]  waves on your mind how they can even control and manipulate your mind and
[41:03.520 --> 41:07.440]  even your physical activity you combine that with the vault seven leaks from
[41:07.440 --> 41:11.360]  wiki leaks to talk about how the CIA has access to pretty much anything in the
[41:11.360 --> 41:15.700]  digital world including your cell phone then you add in the element that the
[41:15.700 --> 41:21.360]  FBI local law enforcement was aware of Nicholas Cruz multiple times up to I
[41:21.360 --> 41:25.800]  think overall when it's all aggregated it's like 60 times or something so I would
[41:25.800 --> 41:31.920]  imagine that that video had to be known to someone I would be shocked if that
[41:31.920 --> 41:36.160]  video was not known to somebody and if not you just wonder why they're not
[41:36.160 --> 41:40.240]  looking into that when they knew this kid was a threat he'd made social media
[41:40.240 --> 41:44.640]  posts before about this he was known as a school shooter he had FBI called so so
[41:44.640 --> 41:48.760]  it's amazing to think that he was able to record that video have it sitting on
[41:48.760 --> 41:51.760]  his phone who knows how long it was on his phone he had a cast on in that video
[41:51.760 --> 41:55.840]  he didn't the day he was arrested I don't know what you're saying is it's declassified
[41:55.840 --> 41:59.760]  that they created mass shooters or mainly assassins that's that's declassified
[41:59.760 --> 42:04.840]  not not mass shooters but assassins it's well known that the tower shooter had
[42:04.840 --> 42:07.560]  connections to that that was kind of the first of this old mass shooting
[42:07.560 --> 42:11.760]  phenomenon here in Austin in the early 60s but what you're getting at is we
[42:11.760 --> 42:15.680]  could reasonably say he could be a mind-control victim when you add the
[42:15.680 --> 42:19.080]  police stand down the Democrats in control of the area the fact that he was
[42:19.080 --> 42:22.360]  allowed to commit all these crimes for four-plus years in the promise program
[42:22.360 --> 42:26.960]  it's all there but I say it's cultural mind control and that that was all
[42:26.960 --> 42:31.000]  allowed to happen the TV the shoot them up games the stand down him saying he's
[42:31.000 --> 42:35.360]  a mass shooter the media hyping mass shootings all of that is the cultural
[42:35.360 --> 42:39.400]  mind control that produces this one way or another it is mind control but here's
[42:39.400 --> 42:43.440]  what it wasn't it wasn't the NRA's fault it wasn't the guns fault and it wasn't
[42:43.440 --> 42:46.200]  the Second Amendment's fault and we're gonna tie all this together on the
[42:46.200 --> 42:49.880]  other side but but that's the key that's who they blame but that's not at
[42:49.880 --> 42:53.160]  fault there are dozens of other things we need to look at it's a total climate
[42:53.160 --> 42:56.400]  a total system where this new phenomenon started 99 of the mass
[42:56.400 --> 43:00.840]  shooting the media hyping it is the critical catalyst I'm so excited the
[43:00.840 --> 43:06.520]  new product at m4warslife.com in a glass bottle two month servings filled to the

[43:17.040 --> 43:22.600]  stimulate because it's beyond that quite frankly I just went off what I saw
[43:22.600 --> 43:27.320]  medical doctors prescribing to their patients but it wasn't prescription but
[43:27.320 --> 43:32.200]  they were charging people a hundred two hundred dollars for the formulae and I

[46:17.280 --> 46:21.360]  behind what's happening in the UK CNN and many others are calling for info

[47:03.040 --> 47:08.560]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:08.560 --> 47:34.760]  you know the authoritarian corporate back left worldwide from communist China to
[47:34.760 --> 47:38.400]  here in the US and their command bases the universities in the
[47:38.400 --> 47:43.520]  mortuaries their masters of defining things and telling you you must follow
[47:43.520 --> 47:47.840]  their playbook and their definition oh the word mankind is hurtful let's take
[47:47.840 --> 47:51.000]  it out of the national anthem of Canada oh the words mother and father are
[47:51.000 --> 47:54.560]  hurtful on elementary school yeah entry forms we're not gonna have that we're
[47:54.560 --> 47:58.960]  gonna have G and Z if you don't use that it's a jail time in California this is
[47:58.960 --> 48:04.840]  here and now they come out and define oh life isn't a heart beating that's just a
[48:04.840 --> 48:08.400]  blob of tissue and of course Planned Parenthood came out just two weeks ago
[48:08.400 --> 48:13.600]  and said yes that's not even a human in there as if they control reality well we
[48:13.600 --> 48:17.320]  are defining reality according to common sense and those are babies those are
[48:17.320 --> 48:20.440]  children and there are going to be hundreds of little boys and little
[48:20.440 --> 48:28.840]  girls killed in Austin Texas execution style hit with acid hit with chemicals
[48:28.840 --> 48:33.720]  as they fight for their lives attack with scalpels sucked out by high-powered
[48:33.720 --> 48:38.320]  vacuum cleaners and then their bodies are going to be rendered up and sold into
[48:38.320 --> 48:43.920]  the medical and cosmetics market so we talk about oh treat animals with with
[48:43.920 --> 48:48.840]  compassion but don't treat humans with compassion because they're not humans and
[48:48.840 --> 48:51.880]  now the bioethics boards are saying we're not gonna take care of the veterans
[48:51.880 --> 48:56.040]  and we're gonna euthanize old people it's so liberal and don't let Trump you
[48:56.040 --> 48:59.280]  know he signed the bill where people that are terminal can take a drug that
[48:59.280 --> 49:03.560]  might save them oh no no no you can have a system suicide but you you can't
[49:03.560 --> 49:10.200]  live I mean this is truly a death cult my friend well and probably thousands of
[49:10.200 --> 49:14.480]  babies nationwide are gonna be slaughtered innocent children denied
[49:14.480 --> 49:21.480]  the right to life tomorrow in America so Alex I reached a point where I got so
[49:21.480 --> 49:28.680]  fed up of hearing about the NRA Republican Second Amendment me you info
[49:28.680 --> 49:34.520]  wars being blamed for anytime there's a shooting so much to the extent that I
[49:34.520 --> 49:38.800]  can't even show up with an info wars mic flag to cover the Santa Fe shooting
[49:38.800 --> 49:43.160]  without getting harassed by someone insinuating that it's our fault people
[49:43.160 --> 49:47.680]  are dying so yeah they're the ones engaging in the bullying of us and so
[49:47.680 --> 49:50.600]  we're allowed to speculate of these are real or not or do they stand down
[49:50.600 --> 49:55.200]  sometimes you know they stand down as we've proven but exactly they're the
[49:55.200 --> 49:58.320]  ones projecting this on us when they're the party of death and that's not even
[49:58.320 --> 50:01.480]  what I was in Santa Fe doing we were just there talking to the students at
[50:01.480 --> 50:05.120]  the school trying to get a story about what was going on it's a live event
[50:05.120 --> 50:08.080]  happening why wouldn't info wars be there because the left wants to define
[50:08.080 --> 50:11.880]  who can go out and be news they wanted their control freaks well and that and
[50:11.880 --> 50:16.320]  that's that's the key but I reached the point where I was so sick of seeing the
[50:16.320 --> 50:20.400]  NRA get blamed for this and gun owners get blamed for this that I decided that
[50:20.400 --> 50:25.040]  I'm going to launch a protest here in Austin at Planned Parenthood tomorrow at
[50:25.040 --> 50:30.080]  11 30 right there will be will be live streaming on the Alex Jones channel on
[50:30.080 --> 50:33.680]  Facebook the Alex Jones channel as well we may pipe in with you oh you're gonna
[50:33.680 --> 50:36.840]  be live with me tomorrow and and so we're gonna be starting at 10 30 central
[50:36.840 --> 50:41.560]  here in Austin Texas and we're gonna out dare you in a blue blue sift you know
[50:41.560 --> 50:45.320]  on the red state how dare you show up I mean I'm sure the anti-file like the
[50:45.320 --> 50:49.200]  last time I protested with Jakarta Jackson at the Abortuary they showed up
[50:49.200 --> 50:52.920]  tried to block us out from having our speech yeah I mean if you've got people
[50:52.920 --> 50:57.200]  that want to show up in support of aborting babies then that's their right
[50:57.200 --> 51:01.400]  to prove that they are in a death cult that's fine what will be perfectly okay
[51:01.400 --> 51:03.960]  with that so tell me where you're gonna be and what's gonna happen the Planned
[51:03.960 --> 51:08.920]  Parenthood on Ben White in Austin Texas I'm gonna be there will be there by 11
[51:08.920 --> 51:12.120]  o'clock live with Alex Jones will be showing up about 10 30 setting up and
[51:12.120 --> 51:16.480]  what we're gonna do is we're gonna we're gonna just have some facts I won't give
[51:16.480 --> 51:21.080]  away the full the full and there's plenty of parking all around there in
[51:21.080 --> 51:24.080]  neighborhoods and businesses yeah or you can or you can you know get dropped
[51:24.080 --> 51:27.080]  off or whatever you need to do if the parking is not bad or you can get
[51:27.080 --> 51:31.600]  parking access road of 290 right off 35 so she's not a lot of traffic you just
[51:31.600 --> 51:34.280]  pull right up and get out and you know if you are afraid of you know some
[51:34.280 --> 51:37.320]  violent protesters showing up and damaging your vehicle then maybe park a
[51:37.320 --> 51:39.960]  little bit farther away and you can get dropped off because we know that that
[51:39.960 --> 51:43.400]  goes on as well oh and by the way when they show up they will say we love
[51:43.400 --> 51:46.880]  Satan we kill our babies and they've got Satan tattoos all over them you're
[51:46.880 --> 51:52.000]  gonna actually face the enemy well and then they'll suddenly go they'll
[51:52.000 --> 51:55.240]  actually they're not acting they're like it's like we are slaves we are dying
[51:55.240 --> 52:00.040]  they can hardly go off and they fall down I want to kill kids oh I mean it's just
[52:00.040 --> 52:06.040]  like Nick Krustov it's like hopeless I hate I love killing them and you're
[52:06.040 --> 52:10.520]  like it means so we're gonna have some some number you want to face Linda Blair
[52:10.520 --> 52:14.920]  because they're drawn like Mazda flame to the killing happening inside you will
[52:14.920 --> 52:20.840]  actually see real Satanist tomorrow you know and it makes me think of Margaret
[52:20.840 --> 52:26.240]  Sanger because Hitler's favorite person she this is actually incredible there is
[52:26.240 --> 52:31.920]  a record stop record shop here in Austin and they do like trendy pins you
[52:31.920 --> 52:36.040]  know like little pins and one of the trendy pins they have is a Margaret
[52:36.040 --> 52:41.880]  Sanger birth control thing and it's like cultural icon Margaret Sanger and it's
[52:41.880 --> 52:47.920]  like a cover the news week cover the time there she is with the KKK real
[52:47.920 --> 52:54.880]  photo so so this is the kind of liberal she says this is the kind of stuff
[52:54.880 --> 52:57.240]  we're gonna bring to the table tomorrow right in front of Planned Parenthood
[52:57.240 --> 53:00.640]  here in Austin, Texas on Benwell you're gonna have mass printouts of that yeah
[53:00.640 --> 53:03.440]  we'll have mass printouts of this we'll have we'll have Margaret Sanger quotes
[53:03.440 --> 53:08.520]  I've got some other factoids so it's gonna be they're gonna have to face the
[53:08.520 --> 53:12.800]  facts and they can sit here and point the finger at everybody else to blame
[53:12.800 --> 53:17.240]  for death as a quote we want to exterminate the Negro population that is
[53:17.240 --> 53:22.680]  a direct Margaret Sanger this is the hero of the left though I mean see this
[53:22.680 --> 53:26.000]  website you can pull up Margaret Sanger quotes the most merciful thing that a
[53:26.000 --> 53:31.000]  large family does to one of its infant members is to kill it and she by the way
[53:31.000 --> 53:35.400]  she dated one of the Rockefellers she was in a big sex orgies all is using the
[53:35.400 --> 53:38.360]  Blavatsky devil worship there they are right there you just saw some of the
[53:38.360 --> 53:42.760]  devil worshippers right there the death cult yeah I mean it's it's
[53:42.760 --> 53:45.400]  unbelievable yeah this lady's not a devil worshipper but the one before said
[53:45.400 --> 53:50.360]  we love Satan we kill our kids I mean it's unbelievable now and this is you
[53:50.360 --> 53:55.080]  have to juxtapose this because now these are the same people that want to blame
[53:55.080 --> 53:58.480]  Trump for everything say Trump is racist say Trump is that this that other
[53:58.480 --> 54:02.680]  thing well we can put a mirror up to them and say you worship Margaret Sanger
[54:02.680 --> 54:07.360]  you worship Planned Parenthood look at what she said look at what she did and
[54:07.360 --> 54:11.000]  let's see how they respond to that and unfortunately you kind of already broke
[54:11.000 --> 54:15.040]  it down they start cackling and breaking down into some they could get
[54:15.040 --> 54:18.440]  if they do a remake of Wizard of Oz they could be I'll catch you my pretty and
[54:18.440 --> 54:22.920]  your little dog as well if I'll be very delicately done though don't you worry
[54:22.920 --> 54:27.280]  the fluoride will slowly rot your brain the cell phones will fry your mind and
[54:27.280 --> 54:33.360]  give you no cognition or any type of basic memory until we fully have you my
[54:33.360 --> 54:38.240]  pretty's and then your soul will be slowly sucked out of you but it would be a
[54:38.240 --> 54:42.640]  lot easier if we could just kill you before you were born so why don't you
[54:42.640 --> 54:47.960]  just die it'd be much better if you just died cuz your mother's in hell and you
[54:47.960 --> 54:52.760]  know what she's doing I want to reincarnate Margaret Sanger and put her
[54:52.760 --> 54:56.680]  head in a jar and make her the president she should be the president of
[54:56.680 --> 55:00.360]  Facebook you know that take that take that new sort of print out go to Kinko's
[55:00.360 --> 55:04.240]  I'm already on it print print hundreds of those yeah and we ought to just go
[55:04.240 --> 55:11.480]  around on liberals cars at the mall you see Hillary stickers you know it's
[55:11.480 --> 55:14.760]  actually funny because they see the media would spin it though Alex Jones puts
[55:14.760 --> 55:18.920]  out Nazi paraphernalia yeah yeah no you're the Nazis all of you it's where
[55:18.920 --> 55:22.920]  you came from it's who you are we we're on to you but look at look at the
[55:22.920 --> 55:28.480]  results of their political policies they don't want the right to try life
[55:28.480 --> 55:31.920]  extension possibly technologies breakthrough technologies new drugs I
[55:31.920 --> 55:36.680]  told you Trump was gonna do that they don't want I told you and to be born so
[55:36.680 --> 55:39.560]  but this is the death cult though I mean this is incredible whether
[55:39.560 --> 55:43.200]  wittingly or unwittingly Trump is forcing them to show who they really
[55:43.200 --> 55:47.440]  are he comes out says MS 13 or animals like no other babies their sweet arts
[55:47.440 --> 55:51.560]  they are devil worshipers they grab little girls and torture them to death
[55:51.560 --> 55:56.040]  in what they call a black right but that you get power but that unborn
[55:56.040 --> 56:01.520]  baby little girls to death and re and mutilate them for days with knives and
[56:01.520 --> 56:06.120]  burn them sucking their energy out and that is a main stream news mainstream
[56:06.120 --> 56:11.720]  news they torture your little girls to death and Nancy pighead Pelosi loves it
[56:11.720 --> 56:15.480]  but that's a human Alex how dare you I'm telling you Soros and all I don't
[56:15.480 --> 56:18.680]  people that know Soros in his house it's all black walls and black mirrors now
[56:18.680 --> 56:21.560]  if you know what that's what Satanists do if you want to say that about an
[56:21.560 --> 56:24.560]  unborn child then that's fine because that doesn't exist I don't even believe
[56:24.560 --> 56:29.280]  that but don't say that about an MS 13 gang member how cold of you I mean how
[56:29.280 --> 56:32.520]  dare you you know why really high-level Satanists have black walls and black
[56:32.520 --> 56:35.240]  mirrors on their house because they think the demons they get so like the
[56:35.240 --> 56:38.600]  demons are just flying around that's what they think they're completely insane
[56:38.600 --> 56:44.200]  well I don't know anybody that would show up to support abortion and there it
[56:44.200 --> 56:49.600]  is Washington Post you feel the devil's helping you MS 13 satanic history but
[56:49.600 --> 56:54.360]  that's what I think it's an energy even if I even if it's a program it's an
[56:54.360 --> 56:58.200]  energy even if politically you think abortion should be legal or your pro
[56:58.200 --> 57:02.840]  choice who shows up to like support abortion like you know like who shows up
[57:02.840 --> 57:06.520]  like yes I want abortion I'm telling you whether white or black they've all
[57:06.520 --> 57:10.600]  you'll see it tomorrow a green skin it's like not it's sursy my dad calls it
[57:10.600 --> 57:16.000]  translucent and they go and then one climbed in a dumpster I saw they ripped

[57:19.480 --> 57:22.520]  standing there and then they come up and try to like bow you and they're like

[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:54.280]  Planned Parenthood operation tomorrow pointing out that they're real Nazi and
[01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:59.160]  eugenics history and and and the KKK in the left I mean it's just it's just the
[01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:04.440]  facts you know I'm really getting tired of them calling us the racist so we've
[01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:08.560]  got our guests joining us here about five minutes but finishing up because you
[01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:12.400]  mentioned oh and all this racism this racism that CNN cultural critic this is
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:17.200]  just today there's some of these clips I can't get track of it says all white
[01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:20.560]  people that voted for Trump are racist make a presence he says Trump is a
[01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:27.680]  stone-cold racist just with no proof Trump MSNBC tries to solve racism with
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:32.160]  bigoted shots at white people this is insane so as you said they're going into
[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:36.520]  tover total overdrive Owen well and I don't even know these clips there's a
[01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:40.400]  series of clips yesterday Don Lemon two other MSNBC hosts so I didn't even
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:44.000]  realize this they must be really hitting this tone hard talking point yeah yeah
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.480]  so this is the process I don't think it'll save millions of people
[01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:52.960]  racist the economy's coming back racist all the numbers say the Republicans are
[01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:57.400]  gonna win Congress in the midterms racist oh my god the giant blue waves
[01:01:57.400 --> 01:02:00.680]  now a red wave the historic Trump's dominating
[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:05.360]  racist the Obama administration is being exposed for all the illegal activity
[01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:09.880]  and the abuse of power it must be racist MSNBC can't torture little girls the
[01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:14.400]  death for sainthood racist you said Valerie Jarrett looks like he's central
[01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:18.560]  casting for planet of the age racist
[01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:25.280]  when we started real fazels play a few of these let's play make a presence key
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:28.960]  here's the the daughter of one of the most famous war criminals ever that help
[01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:32.200]  put into fashion things that kill millions of people here it is here's
[01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:37.680]  Mika driven by president Trump though this renewed sort of open eye look and
[01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:42.040]  this is anecdotal but you even you can use social media also as a lens and you
[01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:48.120]  see in you know fast food restaurants and public places people taking video of
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:52.600]  racist incidents and you can see the way people act and maybe they feel a
[01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:59.760]  license to act that way because this president is a stone-cold racist he
[01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:08.000]  does not well I'm sorry even psycho Joe was like whoa hey by the way I've been
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.880]  in coffee shops and stuff many times when you're younger in college waiting on
[01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:14.880]  somebody and about 10 minutes they go hey you need something you want something
[01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:18.000]  and then a little bit later I'm like yeah I'm waiting on a friend they'll come
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.760]  back by and say you need to it's pretty rude but they go you need to order
[01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:25.040]  something and that's usually if they're real full but that's their right it's
[01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:28.640]  your right not together well why would you want to have somebody loitering at
[01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:32.240]  your restaurant if you've got paying customers that need a seat so so that's

[01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:06.040]  one gets to be Trump but Trump tens of millions of people voted for him after
[01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:11.400]  he showed his cards for years but are you suggesting that they're racist or
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:15.440]  they're yes the people who vote all the people who voted for Donald Trump yes

[01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:17.920]  coming to live
[01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:22.440]  all right coming up after our next gets leaves us at all ties together we're
[01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:25.840]  gonna have an exclusive other for the u-coke with gerard batten the new leader
[01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:30.720]  of UKIP, he's been there since the founding of Great Patriot, so that is coming up.
[01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:36.300]  Kailin Robertson is our guest right now, then we have a Starbucks whistleblower of the incredible
[01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:42.080]  brainwashing going on with the George Soros funded sensitivity training that everyone
[01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:44.680]  is now getting at Starbucks.
[01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:50.560]  But again, I really appreciate the listeners, everybody being so upset about what happened
[01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:57.000]  to Tommy Robinson because this affects everyone and of all the people out there, we all appreciate
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:01.840]  Tommy the most for standing up for free speech, being the first person to expose the Muslim
[01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:06.560]  child grooming, mass sex, pedophile rings, now dozens of trials, hundreds and hundreds
[01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:12.080]  of convictions, thousands of little girls freed in now seven different cities, 1,200
[01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:18.200]  here, 1,500 there, 800 here, 600 there, a couple hundred here, I mean it is insane
[01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:24.840]  that all of this that people talked about like Katie Hopkins 10 years ago that Tommy
[01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:28.880]  talked about 11 years ago and he got put in prison for that now it's out in the open,
[01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:34.720]  we really need to know this is the example of a trailblazing hero, but in the last year
[01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:38.480]  and a half Kailin Robertson and we got to give him credit where he doesn't even want
[01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:41.880]  the credit with his production, his camera work, his web mastering, I mean he's got
[01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:46.700]  the best looking websites, credible camera work, just a great artist, this is what the
[01:07:46.700 --> 01:07:51.040]  culture police do though, he was in college doing great grades a few years ago, multi
[01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:55.680]  criticized Islam and now they were indoctrinating him into it at the school, kicked out of college,
[01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:59.600]  well now you got to deal with him, so the fact that they're pushing people out of the
[01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:04.320]  colleges with a police state is only backfiring, so Kailin it's great to have you here, I
[01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:09.520]  know you have to be careful what you get into, but an update on Tommy and the latest from
[01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:14.480]  the prison, we don't really want to say where he is because right now he's not being persecuted
[01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:19.520]  too much, so certainly the establishment doesn't want to martyr out of him, looks like they've
[01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:21.640]  jumped the shark here, thanks for joining us.
[01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:26.440]  Thanks for having me once again and giving this platform to be able to publicize this
[01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:30.480]  case and to get the information out, so I'm still getting information out in tiny, tiny
[01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:34.960]  dicks, drips and draps, but the latest thing I've got from Tommy is actually a personal
[01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:41.840]  thank you to you personally for raising this price, the profile of this case and also for
[01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:45.320]  facilitating donations so that people can help fund the legal battle which is going
[01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:49.280]  to really push forward and hopefully get him out, so he's actually given a personal thank
[01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:52.960]  you to you directly and of course all the people who have been supporting this campaign,
[01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:56.800]  who have been sharing the content about him and who have been donating to the legal fund
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:09:01.600]  and then on to the legal fund, we actually have just raised enough money as of the last
[01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:08.120]  24 hours to actually start a really good high profile legal battle with really proper people
[01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:14.160]  with heavy weight lawyers and politicians to be able to really, really give this the
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:15.640]  pressure it needs to have.
[01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:18.840]  We don't really have the point where we can probably carry it through all the way unless
[01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:23.840]  the donations continue, but we definitely have enough to be able to start that process
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:25.720]  which is absolutely incredible.
[01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:31.120]  We've been overwhelmed and Tommy is so, so happy with all the support that he's seeing.
[01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:34.560]  Obviously he doesn't have much access to the outside world and for a while at the beginning
[01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:38.120]  he felt it sounded a little bit lost and a little bit lonely, you know, having the entire
[01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:42.320]  establishment media and politicians against you, it might feel a little bit lonely maybe
[01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:46.440]  being in a cell and not realizing just how much support there is on the outside.
[01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:50.480]  Plus there was a media blackout, it was a media blackout for what, three days?
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:56.160]  So he didn't even know, imagine even the president had a newspaper or saw something,
[01:09:56.160 --> 01:09:58.600]  he had no idea what was going on.
[01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:02.280]  Well yeah, exactly and he was very worried because he thought it would all just fizzle
[01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:05.520]  out and die down, he'd just be left in a cell to rot away.
[01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:06.520]  But it didn't happen.
[01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:12.480]  Obviously there was major pressure put on the court which has led to this being lifted.
[01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:16.480]  I don't think they realized the importance and the power of the internet that's so out
[01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:20.480]  of touch, but people really, really pushed it and it was lifted and now the country's
[01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:21.480]  woken up.
[01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:24.720]  And it looks like we're going to be seeing some of the biggest protests in modern British
[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:29.440]  history at least since the Paul riots of the early 90s, which by the way made absolute
[01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:30.440]  history.
[01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:35.000]  So if anything, and if anything happens to him in prison, if we find any reports or we
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:41.200]  see anything that's gone wrong, I guarantee there will be some of the biggest protests
[01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:43.360]  that have ever happened in Britain.
[01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:47.640]  Cities will likely be turned to rubble and that's just going by the amount of anger and
[01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:52.000]  hostility that the people in Britain, the real people, the working people feel towards
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:53.000]  this case.
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:56.160]  They've been let down by the establishment and let down by the politicians and they
[01:10:56.160 --> 01:11:01.040]  know, and everybody else knows it, obviously we have the endorsed protest on the ninth,
[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:05.600]  which is expecting major turnouts, there's tens of thousands of people already confirmed
[01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:07.240]  online to be attending.
[01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:10.720]  It's right outside Downing Street where our prime minister lives.
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:13.360]  It's likely that she will even hear the chance.
[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:16.640]  People have been trying to climb over Downing Street gates recently.
[01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:23.040]  It's absolutely astronomical and people cannot believe what they're seeing before their eyes.
[01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:27.000]  It's that cultural historic moment, kind of a shot heard around the world that they tried
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:31.000]  to recreate fictionally in Veefer Vendetta where you've got the tens of thousands of
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:37.200]  people marching with a Guy Fox mask towards the parliament to remove the corrupt dictator
[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:45.120]  and if the police would have fired on them, it would have been a violent revolution instead
[01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:48.600]  of the people taking the government back and then symbolically blowing up parliament, something
[01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:54.040]  we're not calling for, but repeating what Guy Fox on Guy Fox Day had tried to do.
[01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:58.440]  But there's that image of, they kill the little girl wearing the Guy Fox mask, that triggers
[01:11:58.440 --> 01:11:59.440]  it all.
[01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:04.720]  They kill Tommy Robinson or let him get hurt, it's guaranteed and they've got to know the
[01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:10.520]  arrogant judge now, the same one that was running the child kidnapping trial and covering
[01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:17.720]  that up, evidence points towards and trying to keep secret, he's the one trying to block
[01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:21.880]  what happened and then he's the one also over sending Tommy to jail for 13 months and as
[01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:26.640]  you said, stating this isn't about your last suspended sentence for covering one of these
[01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:30.880]  trials, I'm doing this to you now, well he's got to be rethinking that at this point.
[01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:35.160]  Yeah, it's good you mentioned that as well because so many high profile people, people
[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:38.600]  in the media, people on the left have written up, be criticizing this and say, well, you've
[01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:41.160]  got a suspended sentence, you broke the law, what did he expect?
[01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:45.800]  I don't know how on earth anybody with a reasonable mind can defend this case.
[01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:51.080]  It was over in minutes, that's well documented, it's out in the open, it was basically a counter
[01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:56.200]  record, he wasn't given access to his own lawyer, that's so far from any reasonable
[01:12:56.200 --> 01:13:01.120]  modern first world democratic process that nobody can defend it and the very people who
[01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:04.960]  are defending this, those on the left, don't realize that the very laws that they're supporting
[01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:09.800]  to jail and throw away their critics will be used just against them as soon as the tide
[01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:13.720]  goes the other way, not as it goes the other way, but as soon as we're wiped out, they'll
[01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:18.600]  come straight for them as well and they have no idea what they're supporting.
[01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:23.400]  It's going to be very, very interesting where this is going to go, we've seen football
[01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:26.640]  associations in Britain, I don't know if you know about this in America, who have been
[01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:30.920]  massive rivalries, who have hated each other since the 60s, 70s and 80s, have you seen
[01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:37.240]  Green Street coming together sometimes for the first time specifically for Tommy's case,
[01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:41.080]  they're all going to be putting aside all of their differences and it's almost never
[01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:44.800]  really seen before with all these groups and they're coming together on the 9th and they're
[01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:48.640]  coming together on these days, all for this thing and I've always thought if you unite
[01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:54.400]  and you awaken the spirit of the football lads in Britain, it's going to be absolutely
[01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:59.960]  astronomical, those are the men who are basically on the ground and willing to go out and really
[01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:04.600]  make their voices heard and it's completely unheard of.
[01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:08.280]  This is how it goes down in Romania, this is how it goes down in the old Soviet Union,
[01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:12.040]  this is how it went down here in America at Lexington and Concord and the fact that they're
[01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:16.000]  in the right and the fact that there are these giant pedophile rings that have been all over
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:20.200]  the news and now it's being covered up and the fact that a lot of the police and military
[01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:23.840]  don't want to be part of this either and in fact that we know common purpose and the
[01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:28.840]  socialists are trying to suppress this and trying to Islamify things and the fact that
[01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:33.280]  they've been trying to suppress it only is making it that much stronger and yes, men
[01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:37.120]  have a natural tendency to be in tribes and cultures, they take away national pride, they
[01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:41.840]  take away at all, so all there is is football, rivalries, the hooligans and now it's been
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:44.920]  the hooligans when a Muslim comes in and starts stabbing or shooting people, everybody
[01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:50.400]  runs, one hooligan will take five or six on and actually kill them or defeat them before
[01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:53.240]  he goes to the hospital and lives, famous cases of that, these were just people that
[01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:58.920]  are still fighting men that had their fighting instincts diverted off into a prosthesis,
[01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:04.880]  now realizing there's a real war unifying, the Englishman is coming back to the surface
[01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:08.320]  and is awakening. Oh, you're absolutely right, I'd actually
[01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:12.360]  to go into a little bit more of a sobering thought as well, just to signify how serious
[01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:17.720]  this is, I'll just reveal this today, very, very recently we filmed a video with Tommy
[01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:22.600]  basically saying, if you're watching this, I'm no longer with you, it's basically a video
[01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:27.560]  that will be released in the event of his death and that's how serious he's taking
[01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:30.160]  this and that's how serious we really think this is going to go.
[01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:33.280]  Stay there on here, mothers when we come back, let's show him how committed he is and people
[01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:37.680]  go, that's stupid, why commit? Everything good in life is for people committed, everything
[01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:41.400]  we stand on is the shoulders of men and women that stood for something and it would be one
[01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:45.160]  thing if we were being overtaken by an advanced civilization that empowered us and had life
[01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:50.280]  extension, that's what Trump's trying to do, no, it's radical Islam, the worst, the worst
[01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:53.280]  that have already conquered other Islamic countries that weren't as barbarous, we'll
[01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:57.680]  be back with our special guest, Taylor Robertson, stay with us.

[01:17:58.480 --> 01:18:04.040]  Western Europe has already banned free speech and an iron curtain of censorship is descending
[01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:10.640]  down over the UK, they're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or
[01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:16.160]  gays, you'll get six months in prison, we know we're only about a year or two behind
[01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:20.280]  what's happening in the UK, CNN and many others are calling for Info Wars to be shut
[01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:26.520]  down, taken off the web, Slate magazine has a professor and others saying go beyond censorship,
[01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:32.240]  brainwash young people against Info Wars, psychologically inoculate them with lies so
[01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:36.640]  they don't actually hear what we have to say, we are the most hated news source in the world
[01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:37.640]  by globalists.

[01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:34.640]  I'm Alex Jones, riding shotgun with me, so I'm a shroyer, Kaylin Roberts is with us for
[01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:40.720]  one more segment and we're talking about Tommy Robinson sentenced secretly to 13 months
[01:20:40.720 --> 01:20:51.200]  in prison for not covering any details of a giant trial into secret pedophile networks.
[01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:55.840]  In just one case, hundreds of victim girls, dozens of men reportedly involved, a lot of
[01:20:55.840 --> 01:21:00.040]  the evidence pretty open and shut, no, just for being there and reporting on it.
[01:21:00.040 --> 01:21:06.640]  So now, coming up tomorrow, it'll be seven days, Tommy Robinson has been in the Husqow.
[01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:10.600]  So what can you tell us, Kaylin, and jump in here with any questions you have on riding
[01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:15.480]  shotgun with what else he said, how he's doing, how the family's doing, what's coming
[01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:21.280]  up next and how they're going to handle him as the political president, really blowing
[01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:26.880]  it open to the world that England and the UK is joining the EU in serious draconian
[01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:28.560]  police state activities.
[01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:33.840]  Well, I don't think he's very surprised, we've only, as I said, had drips and drabs
[01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:37.360]  of information, we actually can compare that we'll be able to get much more contact with
[01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:41.040]  him from tomorrow afternoon and as soon as we do, we'll come straight on to him for war
[01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:44.160]  so I'll keep you up to date with everything that's been happening.
[01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:47.920]  To go back, obviously, he's personally thanked you for all the support for the people who
[01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:52.360]  have supported, he said that he supports protests that's happening on the 9th, he said he's
[01:21:52.360 --> 01:21:57.440]  supported all the things that people have been doing to try and raise a profile of this.
[01:21:57.440 --> 01:22:00.720]  He basically wants to make a point that this isn't just about him, he wants people to go
[01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:03.800]  out and protest about what's happening in Britain.
[01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:07.480]  He is going to go down sort of as the one who signifies what's going on, he wants people
[01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:11.560]  to go out and protest that, not even his imprisonment, and that's what's going to be happening.
[01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:15.920]  Oh, and by the way, the enemy will always try to divide groups and do things, I've also
[01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:20.680]  seen a few things on the web like, oh, this Kailin guy, he doesn't speak for Robinson.
[01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:25.120]  Tommy told me that if anything happened to him, because we're talking about building
[01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:28.840]  a whole studio, really expanding here in the next few months, and this happened, I said,
[01:22:28.840 --> 01:22:29.840]  who do I talk to?
[01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:34.480]  He said, well, not my wife, she's private, you talk to Kailin, he's my right-hand guy,
[01:22:34.480 --> 01:22:36.000]  he's the guy helping us get to the next level.
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:41.120]  So Tommy has told me off air that officially Kailin is the guy, if he was in prison, that
[01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:44.800]  I could trust, because obviously there's a trust issue with why somebody's in prison,
[01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:48.360]  how we know Kailin speaks for him, Tommy told me, trust Kailin, go ahead Kailin.
[01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:52.320]  Oh, thanks very much, I mean, that's the case, I mean, people have seen, we work together
[01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:57.160]  from sometimes five o'clock in the morning until two o'clock in the morning constantly,
[01:22:57.160 --> 01:22:59.960]  we've been up and down the UK, all the videos you've seen that have been significant over
[01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:05.280]  the last year, we've done together, and that's the case, and obviously any information that
[01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:10.080]  he wants to bring out, I'll bring that straight away, and people will be able to see that.
[01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:14.080]  But yeah, I mean, the next stage of this is we also, as well as the legal battle, we want
[01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:17.600]  to be meeting with Pauline Hansen, Gerrit Wilders, and the German, we actually want
[01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:22.600]  to be able to meet with a German member of parliament, politician who said that he actually
[01:23:22.600 --> 01:23:28.520]  wanted to give asylum, political asylum to Tommy in this case, and imagine how, you know,
[01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:33.880]  that signifies how bad things have really gotten in this country when Germany is offering
[01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:39.200]  political asylum. But yeah, so those are the next stages of everything. Obviously, we've
[01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:43.600]  had a very, very strange mixed response with this, we've had people on the left say, well,
[01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:47.800]  you know, what does he expect? And you know what you say to that? Well, maybe, maybe they're
[01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:51.400]  right. What, what did he expect? Being in a totalitarian state and trying to speak out
[01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:57.100]  against the truth and trying to actually notify people about the atrocities and the rape
[01:23:57.100 --> 01:24:01.320]  guides and the politics and the problems of Islam? Maybe what did he expect? Probably
[01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:06.360]  to go to prison. But he still did it because he wanted to defend the rights of this country
[01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:10.680]  and speak out for the people that have been silenced. And he's absolutely a hero for doing
[01:24:10.680 --> 01:24:13.760]  that.
[01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:19.760]  That said, it's like telling an old black lady that didn't want to sit at the back
[01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:24.880]  of the bus, Rosa Parks, what did you expect? You know, you got arrested. Tommy was going
[01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:30.760]  out there to peacefully challenge their authoritarian garbage that wasn't even in place a decade
[01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:36.760]  ago in England and say no to common purpose and this whole creeping intimidation of the
[01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:37.760]  population.
[01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:43.640]  Well, yeah, exactly. I mean, the police are absolutely terrified of Islam and he's highlighted
[01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:47.880]  those things. We've actually had reports of Muslims who have been celebrating this,
[01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:51.080]  who have been talking to reporters saying that it's a really, really great thing. I
[01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:55.080]  know that there's a couple of inforwars reporter in reporters in Britain right now. I want
[01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:58.520]  to take them to these areas and actually show them what's going on and show them the people
[01:24:58.520 --> 01:25:00.080]  who are supporting this and celebrating this.
[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:01.080]  Please do.
[01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:05.880]  Yeah, we're going to be working on that right now. And it's going to be incredibly important
[01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:09.800]  to carry on the legacy that Tommy stopped because things aren't going to stop. We spoke
[01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:13.280]  to Tommy recently and he said that he wants to carry on his channel. We're going to be
[01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:17.600]  carrying on making all the videos we have been doing before without him presenting them.
[01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:20.520]  They can speak for themselves. We'll do it through inforwars. We'll do it through his
[01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:23.800]  personal channel. We'll carry on planning through it because even though they can try
[01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:28.160]  and silence him, it's absolutely not going to work. The legacy, the content, what he
[01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:30.440]  has to say has started a ball rolling. It's absolutely.
[01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:35.240]  By the way, you brought up a point I wanted to get to and no one's jumping in here. Our
[01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:41.400]  own Harrison Smith and our camera person that's there with him, they, about half the folks
[01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:45.720]  are like, good, locked Tommy up. The others are horrified, but they find that many people
[01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:50.360]  are like, I want to lock people up and have them disappear for criticizing pedophiles.
[01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:53.360]  I mean, what a whacked out level of sycophants.
[01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:57.840]  Oh, exactly. I don't realize that those people are going to be locked up as well. Anyone with
[01:25:57.840 --> 01:26:03.160]  any political agendas that are not absolutely in total support of the totalitarian state
[01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:06.640]  ideology or total communism are going to be locked up as well. I don't know how these
[01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:11.560]  people don't realize that this is the natural progression we are seeing throughout history,
[01:26:11.560 --> 01:26:15.000]  throughout all the civilizations that have fallen and becoming full communist and full
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:20.720]  totalitarian. We are living in the early stages of that and the symptoms of things like political
[01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:24.440]  activists and journalists being locked up as we're seeing with Tommy are the symptoms
[01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:28.200]  of the early stages of say North Korea. I would say about a hundred years ago, the same
[01:26:28.200 --> 01:26:31.760]  things were happening to people there and it's shocking that people just want to override
[01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:35.960]  it and say, well, just because I don't fundamentally agree with the content of what Tommy says,
[01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:40.320]  or you know what, because he's kind of working class and I guess he's a little bit icky
[01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:44.160]  and it doesn't really make you look very good. Then he shouldn't be thrown away and
[01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:48.720]  silent because it doesn't really suit what I want to say. Those people are totally, totally
[01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:52.760]  mistaken. They have no idea what's coming and if they don't join with this and they
[01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:56.200]  don't carry on with it, they're going to be taken down next.
[01:26:56.200 --> 01:26:59.640]  That's right. This is history happening. We're not just puffing this up. You can feel that
[01:26:59.640 --> 01:27:04.560]  magic. It's really turned it around. It's showing what they wanted to do in the dark
[01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:08.440]  of the night and thanks to your courage, the thousands have showed up in the demonstrations
[01:27:08.440 --> 01:27:13.160]  and it's only building, as you said, with the football hooligans as they're called unifying.
[01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:17.400]  This has got to scare the forces of radical globalism and radical Islam. Owen?
[01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:22.320]  Katelyn, I'm just curious if you can provide us any details or the goals of your upcoming
[01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:25.960]  legal battle. Are you going to try to get Tommy out of prison? Are you going to try
[01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:30.480]  to go after the judge for a wrongful incarceration? Are you looking at free...
[01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:32.680]  Oh, yeah. That's the question. How do we get Tommy out?
[01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:37.040]  Or free speech laws? So what is the goals of the legal battle coming up here?
[01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:40.120]  So I've been lots of, I've been lots of close talks with the legal team that we just formed
[01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:44.720]  together and they really don't want any information coming out about how we really plan to tackle
[01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:48.080]  this because if they get any word of it, then they're going to know what the plan is and
[01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:50.960]  how we're going to do it and they're going to try and, you know, bring up defenses and
[01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:55.760]  sort of stop it from happening. But the main goal is to get him out of prison as soon as
[01:27:55.760 --> 01:28:00.160]  possible, as fast as possible. Right now, he is relatively safe. He's surrounded by
[01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:06.640]  people who are on his side with him. Fortunately, the very wing and department of the prison
[01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:12.440]  that he's in is relatively safe, but he could be moved at any moment to one of the thousands
[01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:17.560]  of radical Islamic training grounds that are our prisons in Britain and it could be coming
[01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:21.600]  very, very ugly, very, very quickly. So the number one goal right now is to get him free
[01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:25.120]  as absolutely fast as possible so we can get back on the ground and report it.
[01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:30.800]  Does he have regular access to a telephone? Is he able to regularly access a telephone?
[01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:34.800]  For seconds a day, very, very, very small amounts of information is coming out, but
[01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:39.640]  we will be able to get more information out after tomorrow afternoon once we've got a new
[01:28:39.640 --> 01:28:43.800]  line of communication set up. And let's not forget returning Al Qaeda and ISIS fighters

[01:33:23.440 --> 01:33:31.880]  enemies, foreign and domestic. It's Alex Jones. Tommy Robertson online, broadcasting
[01:33:31.880 --> 01:33:41.200]  worldwide from the InfoWars.com studios. Tommy Robertson online.com and I hope and pray
[01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:47.360]  I never end up getting put in prison for my speech but I would hope if like Reuters calls
[01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:52.640]  for they want us quote destroyed, shut down, annihilated with fake lawsuits and where they
[01:33:52.640 --> 01:33:56.800]  put a bunch of lies and defamation in an article and then call for me to be destroyed and that's
[01:33:56.800 --> 01:34:03.120]  like everyday Reuters AP, I mean Reuters never puts out editorials like that because they
[01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:07.080]  understand they've got to shut down the truth. I hope whatever happens to me you'll support
[01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:11.360]  my wife and my children folks in the fight to get the truth out because they want to
[01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:14.920]  destroy leaders. If they can do that they're going to win. Katie Hopkins was on Tucker
[01:34:14.920 --> 01:34:18.480]  Carlson last night. It's a very powerful interview that I'm going to play a clip on the next
[01:34:18.480 --> 01:34:26.120]  segment and she talks about UK on a knife edge at her Tommy Robinson arrest. They have
[01:34:26.120 --> 01:34:31.880]  a state sponsored play playing in different cities saying the assassination of Katie Hopkins
[01:34:31.880 --> 01:34:37.040]  and they say basically we hope she gets killed. They praise Congressman Scalise getting shot
[01:34:37.040 --> 01:34:44.800]  on singing in. Joy Behar said God I hope Trump's in Trump Tower when it had that big fire.
[01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:49.360]  These are the violent pig like creatures who then point their fingers at us and tell us
[01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:53.680]  when there's a mass shooting it's our fault. Another one of their Prozac heads did something
[01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:57.400]  like Nick Cruz who was being protected by the state under the promise program when he committed
[01:34:57.400 --> 01:35:02.320]  all these crimes and the FBI and police have been called 39 times. I'm sorry it's 39 times
[01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:10.600]  now not 23. New numbers are out CBS News. So there's the headline Daily Beast is it okay
[01:35:10.600 --> 01:35:15.520]  to stage assassinate Katie Hopkins. These people mean business but they want somebody
[01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:19.920]  else to kill somebody. That's why they always claim that I'm trying to get somebody to go
[01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:25.200]  hurt somebody or attack shooting victims families because that's what they're saying. That's
[01:35:25.200 --> 01:35:28.880]  what the media is pushing is somebody else to be violent. So we're going to do that with
[01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:32.840]  Robert Schroyer here in a moment but finishing up with Kailin Robertson again really Tommy
[01:35:32.840 --> 01:35:37.240]  Robertson's manager. It's been so good the last year and a half watching Tommy go from
[01:35:37.240 --> 01:35:43.080]  you know having really no support and his own camera work to you just really teleporting
[01:35:43.080 --> 01:35:48.120]  you know his work to the next level and now seeing the history change. I just wanted to
[01:35:48.120 --> 01:35:53.720]  you know finish up with how folks donate and just that rousing speech you gave on Sunday
[01:35:53.720 --> 01:35:56.920]  that went so viral on air with us about the real awakening that's happening. What do you
[01:35:56.920 --> 01:36:00.480]  think of Katie Hopkins and her point about Europe being on a knife edge the UK being
[01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:02.560]  on a knife edge.
[01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:06.280]  Well there's a very interesting crossover between Tommy and Katie that's very very similar.
[01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:10.560]  They just seem to be even more open about it with Katie talking openly about assassinating
[01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:13.200]  me. I don't know why they think they can get away with that but she said something interesting
[01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:18.240]  on topic. She said that there's a real feeling that the establishment is against them talking
[01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:22.640]  as the people who are protesting and the real people of Britain and that's exactly right.
[01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:26.400]  I couldn't have put it better myself. There's an electric fight sort of an electricity in
[01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:31.840]  the air in Britain right now of total and utter anger and distrust and people who have
[01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:36.200]  been thrown away to the side of people who have been left to basically defend for themselves
[01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:41.360]  to defend for their family with a police force which is totally uninterested in looking after
[01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:45.120]  them a government which is totally uninterested in looking after them and the left wing government
[01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:49.440]  and the right wing government the Conservatives right now conserved nothing. There's nothing
[01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:53.520]  right wing about them and it's the same with obviously the Labour Communist Party. They've
[01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:57.640]  been completely abandoned and now they're emboldened they're empowered to be able to
[01:36:57.640 --> 01:37:02.600]  take it out onto the streets. V for my debt analogy absolutely fantastic analogy. It looked
[01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:06.360]  really without the explosions of the people trying to desperately climb over the gates
[01:37:06.360 --> 01:37:10.000]  of Downing Street. It was astounding. I've never seen anything like that before and
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:14.120]  Tommy and I have been to hundreds and hundreds of marches throughout the last year and we've
[01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:17.760]  seen them on the left. We've seen marches on the right more sort of parades you call
[01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:22.840]  them on the left and there is never quite been an anger like this and that's because
[01:37:22.840 --> 01:37:26.480]  they messed up. They completely messed up. When Tommy was in the EDL, when he was in
[01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:29.520]  the English Defense League, they were syrup in prison and no one would know anything about
[01:37:29.520 --> 01:37:34.000]  it except for the 10, 20, 30,000 people who would go to his marches. But now things are
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:37.960]  massively different and that's because of info wars on the internet and sites like yours
[01:37:37.960 --> 01:37:41.280]  which are publicising and making a big deal and telling everything about what they're
[01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:46.760]  doing and exposing all of it and that has created a huge tectonic shift within the politics
[01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:52.120]  and the grand work of our society which has fractured and broken all the existing establishments
[01:37:52.120 --> 01:37:57.520]  and all the existing communities and it's given a rise to a new group of people from
[01:37:57.520 --> 01:38:01.400]  the middle class, to the working class, to the educated, to the uneducated, the middle
[01:38:01.400 --> 01:38:05.280]  class, everybody is starting to realise what's going on and they're rising up and the establishment
[01:38:05.280 --> 01:38:09.520]  will not see anything like this. It will have nothing on the poor rights, it will have nothing
[01:38:09.520 --> 01:38:12.880]  on anything else that's happened like this before and it's going to be completely astounding
[01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:16.680]  and it's justified and it's absolutely right and people should go out and they should be
[01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:20.000]  angry and that's how this country's feeling.
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:24.280]  You're right, there is an amazing Katelyn Robinson and there is a chain reaction happening
[01:38:24.280 --> 01:38:29.680]  I think an event horizon has been crossed here and I was just thinking about how your
[01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:35.080]  own female camera lady, Ms. Brown, got attacked by the nine Antifa guys and she fought back
[01:38:35.080 --> 01:38:40.040]  better than they did and in the newest footage of Antifa men just beating up Trump supporter
[01:38:40.040 --> 01:38:44.600]  women and then how they're targeting Katie Hopkins for death and what is the left's
[01:38:44.600 --> 01:38:50.720]  particular salivation and attacking women. I noticed people in wheelchairs too, is that
[01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:53.840]  there's such cowards that they think a woman's an easier target?
[01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:58.800]  No, it's because they don't see them as human. The left do use the very tactics that the
[01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:02.640]  Germans used within the Second World War, they dehumanise, they dehumanise the Jews,
[01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:06.760]  they do the same thing to anybody left of communism now. So they don't see them as women
[01:39:06.760 --> 01:39:10.040]  or they see them as real people or a class of people or anything like that, they see
[01:39:10.040 --> 01:39:13.680]  them as traitors, as disgusting animals who should be wiped out.
[01:39:13.680 --> 01:39:18.320]  That's what it is, they think they own women, like particularly black supporters of Trump
[01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:22.920]  get attacked everywhere because no, the Democrats own you, they say. Well, I'm really impressed
[01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:26.640]  with the work you're doing, but the big thing is, how do we get Tommy Robinson out? The
[01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:31.040]  answer is we don't get into strategy. That is a great point. Thank you, Katelyn. Any
[01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:32.040]  other questions?
[01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:35.520]  No, I was just going to make sure that people got the right website to donate at because
[01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:40.120]  we know that with the new online donation deal, you know, people can prop up other sites.
[01:39:40.120 --> 01:39:44.540]  So Tommy Robinson online.com. Alright, thank you so much, Katelyn, and thanks for showing
[01:39:44.540 --> 01:39:45.540]  our reporters around.
[01:39:45.540 --> 01:39:50.160]  Thanks for having me and thanks for raising and for doing this for Tommy. It's quite
[01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:51.160]  incredible.
[01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:55.360]  Oh, wild horses couldn't drag me away. Thank you. We're all in this together. We are all
[01:39:55.360 --> 01:39:56.360]  Tommy Robinson now.
[01:39:56.360 --> 01:40:00.520]  Well, Alex, let me just tell you, if they took you away to prison, I wouldn't be able
[01:40:00.520 --> 01:40:05.200]  to host the show for you because I'd be scaling the walls of a building probably.
[01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:13.240]  I tell you, I'm not scared of dying, but I think being locked up in a super max would
[01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:14.240]  not be fun.
[01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:17.200]  Well, I don't think the difference though. I mean, I don't know what Tommy's situation
[01:40:17.200 --> 01:40:19.320]  is right now. They say it's okay.
[01:40:19.320 --> 01:40:22.360]  He's in a pretty high security prison, but I don't think I think people, I mean, I don't
[01:40:22.360 --> 01:40:26.520]  think people hate you. I mean, in the prisons, I don't think there would be much hatred for
[01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:28.880]  you. Honestly, I think that they would probably actually admire you.
[01:40:28.880 --> 01:40:33.000]  No, no, no, no, I'm not afraid of getting killed in prison. I'd be afraid to be locked
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:34.240]  up a solitary confinement.
[01:40:34.240 --> 01:40:38.120]  Well, you mean just add the actual act of being in a cell and just not being able to
[01:40:38.120 --> 01:40:39.120]  be free?
[01:40:39.120 --> 01:40:42.920]  No, I'd rather be out in general population fighting if I needed to. It's a lot more entertaining.
[01:40:42.920 --> 01:40:47.760]  Well, I hope I wouldn't be alone, but, you know, I'll find a way to scale that building,
[01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:49.760]  Alex, and I'll prime it up right next to you.
[01:40:49.760 --> 01:40:54.280]  Man, I tell you, they say everywhere they want to arrest us, they want to kill us. They
[01:40:54.280 --> 01:40:58.760]  mean business, man. These are liberals. They will put you in death camps. Communist killed
[01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:03.360]  what 120 million people Hitler killed physically, probably 10 million.
[01:41:03.360 --> 01:41:06.920]  Well, what's the Chinese Communist government total? I mean, you're looking at, I think,
[01:41:06.920 --> 01:41:11.280]  almost 100 million now. And then you have Elizabeth Warren go on national television
[01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:14.560]  and say that the whole of the Chinese government is good.
[01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:18.120]  And that, by the way, that was so crazy on Monday. It was my top story. It's why I get
[01:41:18.120 --> 01:41:23.040]  frustrated. I didn't even get to Elizabeth Warren saying as a whole, the best government
[01:41:23.040 --> 01:41:28.480]  in the world, China, they killed 84 million under Mao. And like you said, another 15 or
[01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:30.520]  so since then, they admit it.
[01:41:30.520 --> 01:41:36.360]  But you know what? They have mobile execution vans and you've got this crazy woman, Pocahontas
[01:41:36.360 --> 01:41:38.960]  up here. God Almighty, save us.
[01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:43.880]  This is why the audience support at infowarstore.com is so important because we literally, we're
[01:41:43.880 --> 01:41:48.400]  live for 10 hours a day now. We still can't cover everything. We still can't get you all
[01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:51.400]  the clips. We still can't get you all the breaking news. So that's why we want to go
[01:41:51.400 --> 01:41:52.400]  live even more.
[01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:54.400]  I totally forgot.
[01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:56.720]  Look at Reuters.
[01:41:56.720 --> 01:42:02.280]  It says Peter Thiel's next target should be infowarst. That's Reuters. Reuters doesn't
[01:42:02.280 --> 01:42:07.040]  do editorials. And it's written like, destroy Jones. He attacks the family. He's evil. It's
[01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:13.080]  all these lies. And it says Jones sends gangs after people. Shut him down. I hate him. He
[01:42:13.080 --> 01:42:17.160]  needs to be destroyed. That's the malice of Fort thought would intend to do harm. They're
[01:42:17.160 --> 01:42:21.400]  the ones lying about me saying they want to destroy me. Hundreds of articles a day. I
[01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:26.680]  mean, what is it we're doing makes them so scared because we've got their dirty number.
[01:42:26.680 --> 01:42:31.920]  What's the scariest part about it is that you have people that are now hearsay zombies.
[01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:35.680]  They just hear what somebody said about Alex Jones. And then they believe it. No research
[01:42:35.680 --> 01:42:39.520]  of their own. As soon as you question it immediately, we've seen it. They hit that
[01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:40.520]  blockade.
[01:42:40.520 --> 01:42:43.960]  That's why they said they got to get us off the air so they can then just lie.
[01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:44.960]  No.
[01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:48.240]  Did you know Jones killed the Jews in World War II? Did you know George Soros cut Hitler's
[01:42:48.240 --> 01:42:51.360]  head off? Did you know George Soros, you know, when he goes to the bathroom, four-leaf
[01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:54.600]  clovers come out? You know, Alex Jones, he goes to the bathroom. Dead little kids come
[01:42:54.600 --> 01:42:56.560]  out. You know, it's like, just total upside down.
[01:42:56.560 --> 01:43:03.080]  Western Europe has already banned free speech and an iron curtain of censorship is sending
[01:43:03.080 --> 01:43:09.800]  down over the U.K. They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or
[01:43:09.800 --> 01:43:15.200]  gays, you'll get six months in prison. We know we're only about a year or two behind
[01:43:15.200 --> 01:43:19.360]  what's happening in the U.K. CNN and many others are calling for info wars to be shut
[01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:25.600]  down, taken off the web. Slate magazine has a professor and others saying go beyond censorship,
[01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:31.320]  brainwash young people against info wars. Psychologically inoculate them with lies so
[01:43:31.320 --> 01:43:35.720]  they don't actually hear what we have to say. We are the most hated news source in the world
[01:43:35.720 --> 01:43:40.480]  by globalists. It is so critical that you go to infowars.com, forward slash newsletter

[01:47:19.840 --> 01:47:31.200]  That's right, controlling the narrative. I want to give you some positive points here
[01:47:31.200 --> 01:47:35.840]  in a moment with Owen Troyer and then he ride a shotgun if you want, but you got your own
[01:47:35.840 --> 01:47:38.160]  three, four hour show coming up. I've just invited him for a segment, but I've been making
[01:47:38.160 --> 01:47:40.920]  you stay in there. It's good to have you here with us. He's been hosting for three hours
[01:47:40.920 --> 01:47:44.720]  with Roger Stone in the war room coming up at three o'clock today. Central standard time,
[01:47:44.720 --> 01:47:50.540]  but if you think I'm joking around, I forgot about this on Monday. I was going to lead
[01:47:50.540 --> 01:47:56.000]  the show. Senator Warren endorses communist China's government for their management,
[01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:01.560]  their style. Remember when Mao Zedong died in the late seventies, there was an editorial
[01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:04.920]  in the New York Times with David Rockefeller praising it saying, this is the model we
[01:48:04.920 --> 01:48:13.080]  need. A few thousand billionaires, a bunch of slaves, no workers comp. The bathroom is
[01:48:13.080 --> 01:48:16.760]  you go out pooping the street at most factories. Daycare is you chain your kids up to light
[01:48:16.760 --> 01:48:22.480]  poles. I'm not kidding. The river is catch on fire. They sell political dissonance organs.
[01:48:22.480 --> 01:48:26.800]  Buddhist even liberals now go, I hate the Dalai Lama. He's a piece of crap. You know, that's
[01:48:26.800 --> 01:48:29.800]  because that's it's liberal. They hate the Dalai Lama now. These liberals, he's liking,
[01:48:29.800 --> 01:48:34.200]  but okay, Dalai Lama, some, you know, well, it's some ancestral dictatorship. Okay, well,
[01:48:34.200 --> 01:48:39.720]  let's move on from that. Nothing compared to the communist Chinese, just regular Buddhist
[01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:45.840]  are killed by the millions. And the liberals are like, good, you need to see, you're not
[01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:51.360]  liberals. What you are is demons. And she's really mad that, you know, that Trump's not
[01:48:51.360 --> 01:48:57.040]  letting China totally screw us over. So here she is talking about the wonders of the Chinese
[01:48:57.040 --> 01:49:04.240]  communist government, which is a plutocracy, a dictatorship of a central committee. Here
[01:49:04.240 --> 01:49:10.880]  it is. I want this to work. I want this to work to reduce the threat to South Korea,
[01:49:10.880 --> 01:49:15.680]  to Japan, to our allies in the region, to the United States of America, to the entire
[01:49:15.680 --> 01:49:21.800]  world. But it really takes a strategy. And I look at the comparison with China. Look
[01:49:21.800 --> 01:49:27.680]  at what China's doing. China's got the long term art. And it's playing everybody. It's
[01:49:27.680 --> 01:49:33.040]  playing North Korea. It's playing South Korea. It's playing the United States of America.
[01:49:33.040 --> 01:49:38.880]  Because it has a long time, whole of government strategy that keeps driving toward an end.
[01:49:38.880 --> 01:49:43.760]  At this point, who knows what's coming out of Washington. And look, like I said, I hope
[01:49:43.760 --> 01:49:45.800]  it all works.
[01:49:45.800 --> 01:49:51.160]  The plan has been sell America out. China's had one sided trade deals, 900 billion a year.
[01:49:51.160 --> 01:49:54.920]  Yeah, no wonder they're building giant roads and trains everywhere because we've been screwed
[01:49:54.920 --> 01:49:59.280]  over. That's the globalist plan. And then she says, just give us a central thing. We'd
[01:49:59.280 --> 01:50:03.560]  make it work better. No, people like you that wanted a centralized system got all our investment
[01:50:03.560 --> 01:50:07.840]  through one side of deals show that thousands of rich globalists can go over there and be
[01:50:07.840 --> 01:50:12.760]  billionaires and screw us over. That's why Apple moved there three months ago and gave
[01:50:12.760 --> 01:50:19.480]  them the keys of the kingdom, the entire code system. And that's why Obama gave them the
[01:50:19.480 --> 01:50:23.840]  office of personal management hack was to checkmate America. And Trump came in to block
[01:50:23.840 --> 01:50:29.040]  that in our emergency hour. And we're barely hanging on while you cheerlead for China when
[01:50:29.040 --> 01:50:34.000]  the Democrat Party is on record, basically financed by the chai comms. These people are
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:39.040]  unbelievable trader filth and the way they sneak into the room, how China's so great
[01:50:39.040 --> 01:50:45.240]  and how China's so smart because you globalists propped them up. You did it. You're the enemy.
[01:50:45.240 --> 01:50:46.240]  You're the problem.
[01:50:46.240 --> 01:50:52.800]  Well, she intentionally praises China and what they've done. She says the long term arc.
[01:50:52.800 --> 01:50:57.040]  Okay, you're talking about the long term or arc of communist term.
[01:50:57.040 --> 01:50:58.040]  Exactly.
[01:50:58.040 --> 01:51:00.200]  They call it the bridge. They call it the arc.
[01:51:00.200 --> 01:51:05.800]  But notice at the top of that clip what she does. She mentions South Korea, North Korea,
[01:51:05.800 --> 01:51:11.040]  Japan, China, Mexico, all these other countries. She mentions America last. So she intentionally
[01:51:11.040 --> 01:51:15.560]  praises China in that clip, but she unintentionally shows where her ally really is.
[01:51:15.560 --> 01:51:18.520]  Go to Obama's Twitter. I'm going to show you something on his Twitter. This was pointed
[01:51:18.520 --> 01:51:22.600]  out to me by an Army Psyops officer just a while back and we'll see if they haven't changed
[01:51:22.600 --> 01:51:36.520]  it. But he, American and father and husband is all lowercase and everything else is uppercase
[01:51:36.520 --> 01:51:40.600]  where he's explaining he's a globalist. It's just, you know, Obama's main Twitter and
[01:51:40.600 --> 01:51:47.240]  it's his profile. There it is. Dad, husband, president, citizen. You see that? Well, dad's
[01:51:47.240 --> 01:51:52.680]  capitalized as the first in the sentence. Husband's not president and then citizen.
[01:51:52.680 --> 01:51:56.280]  And he said, well, you capitalized president. Well, unless you're saying what president?
[01:51:56.280 --> 01:52:00.400]  Well, he's not the president. He is a former president, but that's nice. By the way, your
[01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:06.320]  library in Chicago is getting sued because you lied about the terms of 90 plus percent
[01:52:06.320 --> 01:52:12.080]  of his 103 million followers are fake. It's all fake. It's like his wife. Okay. The next
[01:52:12.080 --> 01:52:16.560]  clip, Katie Hopkins was like part of this from Tucker Carlson. Again, this is going back
[01:52:16.560 --> 01:52:20.720]  to Tommy Robinson, but it's true. Europe and the UK are on a knife's edge because they're
[01:52:20.720 --> 01:52:25.840]  attempting the globalist, socialist, Islamic breaking of the back, but it's beginning to
[01:52:25.840 --> 01:52:26.840]  fail. Here it is.
[01:52:26.840 --> 01:52:32.080]  These are very dark times in the UK. It's a very curious feeling in this country at
[01:52:32.080 --> 01:52:37.200]  the moment. And I would say the country is on a knife edge. There is a real sense now
[01:52:37.200 --> 01:52:42.200]  that we are against our own government, that the establishment is working against us. And
[01:52:42.200 --> 01:52:48.080]  in order to cleanse voices it doesn't like, it will put them inside for as long as it
[01:52:48.080 --> 01:52:49.800]  needs to to shut them up.
[01:52:49.800 --> 01:52:54.200]  That's horrifying. I don't know. I'll be honest, anything really about Tommy Robinson, I don't
[01:52:54.200 --> 01:52:58.960]  care. I don't know what he believed. It doesn't matter. He was saying he thinks in public.
[01:52:58.960 --> 01:53:03.840]  I totally take that, Tucker. I don't know Tommy either. I'm not a colleague of his. I'm
[01:53:03.840 --> 01:53:10.400]  not. I don't work with him. Many people say he's an idiot. And in some ways I don't care.
[01:53:10.400 --> 01:53:15.080]  He's been told not to report at these trials. And yet he's still there reporting. He didn't
[01:53:15.080 --> 01:53:20.200]  go with his lawyer or solicitor. You know, he knew he was going to get into trouble.
[01:53:20.200 --> 01:53:24.280]  But then he's got guts and guts is enough. Even if you don't like the guy, even if you
[01:53:24.280 --> 01:53:28.040]  don't know the guy, it looks like you were talking earlier, fundamental principles like
[01:53:28.040 --> 01:53:33.880]  yes, where was the swift justice for the victims of the grooming gangs? That's right. Where
[01:53:33.880 --> 01:53:38.640]  was the swift justice for the 11 year old that was raped? If we can get Tommy in prison
[01:53:38.640 --> 01:53:44.080]  within five hours, where was the swift justice for these men? And where was the swift justice
[01:53:44.080 --> 01:53:51.200]  for the victims? The full clip is in an article at info wars.com and news wars.com. Katie
[01:53:51.200 --> 01:53:55.760]  Hopkins says that the world is on a knife's edge. The UK is on a knife's edge. There it
[01:53:55.760 --> 01:54:00.000]  is. UK journalist, UK on the knife's edge, Edward Tommy Robinson, arrest dark times ahead
[01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.760]  or well in police state. And I like Katie. I think she's on the show tomorrow. So is
[01:54:02.760 --> 01:54:08.720]  this is a, they're like 90% on the show tomorrow. He obviously just got pardoned. That's a whole
[01:54:08.720 --> 01:54:15.520]  another subject. This is a very, very, very, very serious time. Well, Tommy Robinson is
[01:54:15.520 --> 01:54:19.520]  brilliant. You know, you can say he's an idiot for getting arrested. Is he an idiot or is
[01:54:19.520 --> 01:54:23.480]  he brilliant in his those guys that like to get a concord? They were idiots. Exactly.
[01:54:23.480 --> 01:54:27.080]  Turn to their guns. There you go. Oh, Rosa Parks was an idiot for not getting out of
[01:54:27.080 --> 01:54:30.880]  the front seat. So so that's what it is. It's an idiot. If you want to look at these idiots
[01:54:30.880 --> 01:54:33.760]  going in and demanding, you know, they were able to eat a lunch counter. That's not this
[01:54:33.760 --> 01:54:38.280]  idiot demanding he'd be able to use the bathroom. That's not having foresight. That's not understanding
[01:54:38.280 --> 01:54:45.560]  the future. That's not seeing the Machiavellian 60 chess that the brilliance really is there.
[01:54:45.560 --> 01:54:49.200]  Well, I'll tell you what Trump's doing. It looks like 10 D chess and all those 50 G chess,
[01:54:49.200 --> 01:54:54.240]  the infinity chess, but time travel chess. He's actually a time traveler. He's an orangutan
[01:54:54.240 --> 01:54:58.200]  from the future. The orangutan's involved into these advanced species. And then Trump
[01:54:58.200 --> 01:55:01.720]  came back as the orangutan. That's actually in that's actually in some movie. So it's
[01:55:01.720 --> 01:55:05.640]  real, obviously. Was it a movie? Yeah. But did you know you can it's in a movie that
[01:55:05.640 --> 01:55:09.480]  he comes back as an orangutan orangutan. You're like the most developed A's forever.
[01:55:09.480 --> 01:55:14.920]  But did you know actually, Alex, did you know you I can compare in fact, Alex Jones is an
[01:55:14.920 --> 01:55:23.680]  ape. All right, Alex Jones is an ape. Donald Trump is an ape. And Barack Obama is he was
[01:55:23.680 --> 01:55:32.280]  a former president. He's looking like an ape. He's looking like an ape. If I need to find
[01:55:32.280 --> 01:55:36.680]  an ape right now, somebody somebody find me an orangutan. There's one in studio. There's
[01:55:36.680 --> 01:55:43.240]  a there's an orangutan. White people don't know what it's like to be poor. So so now
[01:55:43.240 --> 01:55:48.400]  let's allow the media to make fun of Alex Jones and call Alex an ape and everything.
[01:55:48.400 --> 01:55:53.880]  And that's fine. That's fine. Call him an ape. Make fun of him. Have your humor. Oh,
[01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:59.560]  Rosie O'Donnell said that about Valerie Jarrett. Oh my gosh. Oh, we stopped the presses. She
[01:55:59.560 --> 01:56:04.440]  is what is Valerie Jarrett. She she's from Iran, which she might be black too. Oh, this
[01:56:04.440 --> 01:56:08.720]  is huge. We got Roseanne now. We got her. We got her. She said it about Valerie Jarrett.
[01:56:08.720 --> 01:56:12.080]  We got her. She's done. Oh, and by the way, I don't think it's fair. She doesn't look
[01:56:12.080 --> 01:56:20.280]  like an ape. She looks like like a weird like dogfish or something. So we're gonna undersea
[01:56:20.280 --> 01:56:27.440]  like eel. Have you noticed how every article about Roseanne says conservative Roseanne Trump
[01:56:27.440 --> 01:56:32.520]  supporter Roseanne? But are the Harvey Weinstein articles about him being indicted in the rape
[01:56:32.520 --> 01:56:38.080]  case? They don't mention about him being an Obama fund total backer and Obama on the child
[01:56:38.080 --> 01:56:42.800]  kidnapping God of Hollywood, a Hillary supporter. Oh, and notice I've even mentioned that. Notice
[01:56:42.800 --> 01:56:46.600]  that whole falls happening. Here's the good news. We have a Starbucks whistleblower coming
[01:56:46.600 --> 01:56:51.880]  in. And can you guys reprint me that article from info wars.com confirmed George Soros
[01:56:51.880 --> 01:56:55.880]  literally behind Starbucks brainwashing. And then Matt did a special report on he printed
[01:56:55.880 --> 01:56:59.880]  out from the actual group financing it and running it. That's a George Soros group. It
[01:56:59.880 --> 01:57:05.560]  actually says open society foundations, the main funders. So I need those before we get
[01:57:05.560 --> 01:57:10.080]  her on. But there it is open society foundation perception Institute. That's coming up. But
[01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:15.240]  Owen, the big thing here is, it's all falling apart. Now briefly, I didn't plug any of this

[01:59:52.080 --> 02:00:19.640]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:00:19.640 --> 02:00:44.600]  Oh Troyer is our guest over five minutes and he is going to check out for about an hour
[02:00:44.600 --> 02:00:48.680]  and 55 minutes and then he will be hosting the war room three o'clock central standard
[02:00:48.680 --> 02:00:53.440]  time and I cannot express enough to the listeners and viewers on local TV stations, radio stations,
[02:00:53.440 --> 02:01:03.480]  the internet, you telling neighbors, friends, community, family about the broadcast is just
[02:01:03.480 --> 02:01:10.840]  absolutely totally and completely critical and without you doing that we are not going
[02:01:10.840 --> 02:01:16.000]  to be able to defeat the massive censorship, the fake lawsuits, the threats, their admissions
[02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:22.680]  in Reuters and the new republic and CNN. We want Alex Jones shut down and then CNN said
[02:01:22.680 --> 02:01:26.720]  Alex Jones says nobody died at Parkland. Was it true? Total defamation. They're still running
[02:01:26.720 --> 02:01:31.880]  with that. They're trying to get lawsuits filed on that. They probably will. It doesn't
[02:01:31.880 --> 02:01:36.240]  matter. He didn't say nobody died at Parkland. You're for the children. You're against the
[02:01:36.240 --> 02:01:40.240]  children that got shot of you don't sue him and if you don't put him in jail or you don't
[02:01:40.240 --> 02:01:45.400]  I mean it's the level that they've gotten to of their total deception. That's why I just
[02:01:45.400 --> 02:01:50.040]  keep harping that this is the broadcast. They fear it. They want to set the precedent and
[02:01:50.040 --> 02:01:54.560]  the act of sharing the articles, the videos, the links is critical. Can you speak to that?
[02:01:54.560 --> 02:01:58.880]  The power of how many people we run into who were told person to person about info wars
[02:01:58.880 --> 02:02:03.760]  dot com person to person about news wars dot com person to person about videos and articles
[02:02:03.760 --> 02:02:07.800]  that changed whole lives. That's why they fear us. Well, here's why everything is being
[02:02:07.800 --> 02:02:12.560]  driven to the digital realm. Here's why everything is being driven to the digital platforms because
[02:02:12.560 --> 02:02:17.760]  you can monitor, you can censor, you can shut people down, you can shut people off. So you
[02:02:17.760 --> 02:02:21.480]  know that they have the algorithm rhythms built into YouTube and Twitter and Facebook
[02:02:21.480 --> 02:02:25.800]  to make sure the Alex Jones show does not get seen to make sure our YouTube channel
[02:02:25.800 --> 02:02:30.880]  when Joe Rogan had me on it was the number one podcast ever. The message was we're delisting
[02:02:30.880 --> 02:02:34.800]  the the iTunes we came and find at the top. We're going to delist a bunch of your other
[02:02:34.800 --> 02:02:39.800]  stuff as a message. You have them on again. We're going to shut you down and you know,
[02:02:39.800 --> 02:02:44.080]  don't let it trend on YouTube. So how do you beat that? How do you beat the totalitarian
[02:02:44.080 --> 02:02:49.000]  number one podcast? He's ever had times double. And so for being number one, you don't get
[02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:54.040]  to be on it. So to beat the censorship, you have to go into the physical realm and share
[02:02:54.040 --> 02:02:58.400]  things. You have to literally be in the physical realm. If you want to beat the digital realm,
[02:02:58.400 --> 02:03:02.360]  you have to operate in the physical realm. And that's why tomorrow you're going to be
[02:03:02.360 --> 02:03:05.920]  out at the number one abortionary in central Texas where tens of thousands of young children
[02:03:05.920 --> 02:03:09.760]  lose their lives every year. Plenty of parking easy to get to. Right. You know what? I I
[02:03:09.760 --> 02:03:13.160]  like to say, you know what? There's a lot of liberals in Austin, Texas. I'd like to
[02:03:13.160 --> 02:03:17.760]  invite the liberals out to actually protest against death with me. I'd like to invite
[02:03:17.760 --> 02:03:21.880]  the liberals to come out and protest against the slaughter of innocent children with me.
[02:03:21.880 --> 02:03:25.440]  You know, you do the virtue signaling for the victims and the tragic events with these
[02:03:25.440 --> 02:03:30.280]  school shootings. Come out and join me at 201 East Benwhite Boulevard tomorrow at the
[02:03:30.280 --> 02:03:34.480]  Planned Parenthood here in Austin, Texas. Come out and join me at 11 o'clock central
[02:03:34.480 --> 02:03:39.040]  and protest against against the slaughter. And by the way, if you're one of these folks
[02:03:39.040 --> 02:03:42.840]  that says they think blacks are under attack, well, this is where most blacks die. 52 percent
[02:03:42.840 --> 02:03:45.920]  of blacks, you know, die in these places where they're ever born. Come out. Are you're in
[02:03:45.920 --> 02:03:50.240]  La Raza? You say you're for the Hispanic race, which isn't even a race. I just I just see
[02:03:50.240 --> 02:03:54.560]  people. Well, you should come out. You know, if you say you're in La Raza or Metia, where
[02:03:54.560 --> 02:03:59.240]  the most Hispanics are actually dying. By the way, Alex, a bit of a side note, but kind
[02:03:59.240 --> 02:04:06.080]  of the same issue over the Memorial Day weekend, I think between Chicago, Baltimore, I forget
[02:04:06.080 --> 02:04:10.880]  the cities, but essentially you had you had hundreds of shootings, dozens of people dead.
[02:04:10.880 --> 02:04:14.680]  None of them are humanized. They're never on the news. It's only if it's a school shooting
[02:04:14.680 --> 02:04:17.880]  where the left promotes it, where they're on Prozac, where they stand down and then
[02:04:17.880 --> 02:04:21.760]  all got under the blame. But inner cities, you know, black on black crime, you know,
[02:04:21.760 --> 02:04:25.960]  that doesn't get that doesn't get talked about in the media. Nobody humanizes those victims.
[02:04:25.960 --> 02:04:31.280]  That just is going to be out there at 11 a.m. tomorrow. 11 a.m. We'll be covering it live
[02:04:31.280 --> 02:04:36.160]  right here. It's only like, I don't know, we're in Central Austin. That's in South Austin.
[02:04:36.160 --> 02:04:41.320]  So it's about five miles from where we're at. So we'll be covering all of that. Ladies
[02:04:41.320 --> 02:04:44.040]  and gentlemen, it's only a couple miles from the warehouse in South Austin. So we're going
[02:04:44.040 --> 02:04:49.400]  to be covering all that tomorrow. 11 a.m. Central. When the info war kicks off, infowars

[02:06:56.480 --> 02:06:58.480]  The more they abuse you,

[02:07:38.480 --> 02:07:40.480]  Now!
[02:07:40.480 --> 02:07:43.480]  They think you're a goldfish!
[02:07:43.480 --> 02:07:46.480]  I've been betting on you my whole life!
[02:07:46.480 --> 02:07:48.480]  I believe in you!

[02:07:54.480 --> 02:07:56.480]  All genitals are cut off.
[02:07:56.480 --> 02:07:58.480]  And we're kicking these trainers' asses politically.
[02:07:58.480 --> 02:08:00.480]  And we're not backing down at her.
[02:08:00.480 --> 02:08:02.480]  I want to kick these people!

[02:08:39.480 --> 02:08:41.480]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[02:08:41.480 --> 02:08:44.480]  we have a Starbucks whistleblower.
[02:08:44.480 --> 02:08:46.480]  I'm not going to tell you her name.
[02:08:46.480 --> 02:08:48.480]  I'm not going to tell you what region she's in,
[02:08:48.480 --> 02:08:50.480]  so she won't get persecuted for it.
[02:08:50.480 --> 02:08:53.480]  But she was there last week during the day of reeducation.
[02:08:53.480 --> 02:08:56.480]  We have a critical article from infowars.com
[02:08:56.480 --> 02:08:59.480]  that I'll retweet from a few days ago.
[02:08:59.480 --> 02:09:02.480]  At Real Alex Jones, people can see this for themselves and read along.
[02:09:02.480 --> 02:09:08.480]  Soros Open Society, literally behind Starbucks sensitivity training.
[02:09:08.480 --> 02:09:12.480]  And here is the Perception Institute.
[02:09:12.480 --> 02:09:15.480]  And the main funders are Ford Foundation,
[02:09:15.480 --> 02:09:17.480]  Open Society Foundation,
[02:09:17.480 --> 02:09:21.480]  and all of these groups are funded by Soros,
[02:09:21.480 --> 02:09:25.480]  not just the actual head foundation he has,
[02:09:25.480 --> 02:09:28.480]  the Open Society Foundation.
[02:09:28.480 --> 02:09:30.480]  All these groups are the same mega-money,
[02:09:30.480 --> 02:09:33.480]  tax-exempt foundations that are doing this.
[02:09:33.480 --> 02:09:36.480]  And in the report that Matt put together,
[02:09:36.480 --> 02:09:39.480]  another one of our producers, he shows mainstream news
[02:09:39.480 --> 02:09:42.480]  with major studies showing the sensitivity training
[02:09:42.480 --> 02:09:46.480]  creates more racism, more division.
[02:09:46.480 --> 02:09:49.480]  Just like the Me Too Stuff, the Prairie Home Companion guy,
[02:09:49.480 --> 02:09:52.480]  the woman hugged him, her shirt went up,
[02:09:52.480 --> 02:09:55.480]  he touched her back, he was fired.
[02:09:55.480 --> 02:09:57.480]  That's not the same as Weinstein raping someone.
[02:09:57.480 --> 02:10:01.480]  People come in, they want to sit in there and do nothing
[02:10:01.480 --> 02:10:04.480]  and use the bathroom and not buy anything.
[02:10:04.480 --> 02:10:07.480]  And don't solicit, don't loiter.
[02:10:07.480 --> 02:10:11.480]  But this is what it's all about.
[02:10:11.480 --> 02:10:13.480]  It's absolutely meant to break down society
[02:10:13.480 --> 02:10:14.480]  and cause culture war.
[02:10:14.480 --> 02:10:15.480]  That's in the WikiLeaks.
[02:10:15.480 --> 02:10:19.480]  So joining us is a lady.
[02:10:19.480 --> 02:10:20.480]  What should we call you?
[02:10:20.480 --> 02:10:24.480]  Should we call you Starbucks whistleblower
[02:10:24.480 --> 02:10:27.480]  or Starbucks X?
[02:10:27.480 --> 02:10:30.480]  Patriotic barista.
[02:10:30.480 --> 02:10:31.480]  Well, fantastic.
[02:10:31.480 --> 02:10:33.480]  Thanks for joining us.
[02:10:33.480 --> 02:10:37.480]  I mean, describe without saying where you are,
[02:10:37.480 --> 02:10:39.480]  how this began, what you witnessed.
[02:10:39.480 --> 02:10:40.480]  Sure.
[02:10:40.480 --> 02:10:41.480]  Well, thanks for having me.
[02:10:41.480 --> 02:10:44.480]  I'm in an area that has a pretty big city.
[02:10:44.480 --> 02:10:46.480]  We also have a place that's a little bit urban
[02:10:46.480 --> 02:10:47.480]  outside of the city.
[02:10:47.480 --> 02:10:49.480]  We have a mix of everybody going on
[02:10:49.480 --> 02:10:53.480]  and the store is, I could feel already there is division.
[02:10:53.480 --> 02:10:57.480]  This has not done anything good for Starbucks
[02:10:57.480 --> 02:10:58.480]  or for our store.
[02:10:58.480 --> 02:11:00.480]  And it's not going to help, especially when they start
[02:11:00.480 --> 02:11:03.480]  expanding it to other companies.
[02:11:03.480 --> 02:11:05.480]  Because we know this is just a start.
[02:11:05.480 --> 02:11:07.480]  So I'd like to start with Starbucks statement.
[02:11:07.480 --> 02:11:10.480]  Learning a session on raised bias
[02:11:10.480 --> 02:11:12.480]  and creating a welcoming environment to all.
[02:11:12.480 --> 02:11:14.480]  It sounds super great, right?
[02:11:14.480 --> 02:11:15.480]  This is their own words.
[02:11:15.480 --> 02:11:17.480]  This training was developed with guidance
[02:11:17.480 --> 02:11:19.480]  by national and local experts.
[02:11:19.480 --> 02:11:21.480]  They're talking experts.
[02:11:21.480 --> 02:11:22.480]  So it sounds really good.
[02:11:22.480 --> 02:11:23.480]  We're positive.
[02:11:23.480 --> 02:11:24.480]  We're going into it.
[02:11:24.480 --> 02:11:26.480]  And then we look at the experts who are actually
[02:11:26.480 --> 02:11:30.480]  devising this session.
[02:11:30.480 --> 02:11:32.480]  We have Cheryl Flynn, Cheryl Eiffel,
[02:11:32.480 --> 02:11:36.480]  president of the director of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund,
[02:11:36.480 --> 02:11:38.480]  served on the board of the George Thoreau
[02:11:38.480 --> 02:11:40.480]  Open Society Foundation.
[02:11:40.480 --> 02:11:43.480]  We have Heather McGee, president of DEMO,
[02:11:43.480 --> 02:11:45.480]  a left-leaning public policy organization.
[02:11:45.480 --> 02:11:46.480]  Guess what?
[02:11:46.480 --> 02:11:48.480]  She also served on the board of the George Thoreau
[02:11:48.480 --> 02:11:50.480]  Open Society Foundation.
[02:11:50.480 --> 02:11:54.480]  Brian Stevenson, lawyer, social justice activist.
[02:11:54.480 --> 02:11:56.480]  And you guessed it.
[02:11:56.480 --> 02:11:58.480]  He also served on the board of the George Thoreau
[02:11:58.480 --> 02:12:00.480]  Open Society Foundation.
[02:12:00.480 --> 02:12:01.480]  And it doesn't just stop there.
[02:12:01.480 --> 02:12:03.480]  There are a few more names of experts
[02:12:03.480 --> 02:12:05.480]  who are also connected directly, like you said,
[02:12:05.480 --> 02:12:09.480]  Alex, to George Thoreau and these left-leaning policies.
[02:12:09.480 --> 02:12:13.480]  Jonathan Greenblatt, Eric Holder, Alexis McGill Johnson.
[02:12:13.480 --> 02:12:16.480]  It already sounds one-sided going into this.
[02:12:16.480 --> 02:12:18.480]  But I went in with a positive outlook
[02:12:18.480 --> 02:12:22.480]  and said maybe we can help make a welcoming environment.
[02:12:22.480 --> 02:12:25.480]  But it doesn't get much better from there.
[02:12:25.480 --> 02:12:28.480]  When we get to the videos, we have every speaker,
[02:12:28.480 --> 02:12:32.480]  pretty much every speaker, happens to be black.
[02:12:32.480 --> 02:12:35.480]  And it's basically virtue signal after virtue signal.
[02:12:35.480 --> 02:12:37.480]  I was shocked that they didn't even say the word
[02:12:37.480 --> 02:12:38.480]  right privilege.
[02:12:38.480 --> 02:12:41.480]  But let me tell you, every non-black employee,
[02:12:41.480 --> 02:12:44.480]  they were forced to feel white privilege in the notebook.
[02:12:44.480 --> 02:12:46.480]  And the notebook is a thing they have online.
[02:12:46.480 --> 02:12:48.480]  You can see it at starbuckschannel.com
[02:12:48.480 --> 02:12:50.480]  slash the third place.
[02:12:50.480 --> 02:12:53.480]  Take, for instance, page 20.
[02:12:53.480 --> 02:12:55.480]  It's the first time you, number seven,
[02:12:55.480 --> 02:12:57.480]  the first time you had a senior role model
[02:12:57.480 --> 02:13:01.480]  in your organization with a similar racial identity as your own.
[02:13:01.480 --> 02:13:04.480]  I couldn't answer it because this makes me feel
[02:13:04.480 --> 02:13:07.480]  like I myself have to have white privilege.
[02:13:07.480 --> 02:13:08.480]  Well, that's what it's about.
[02:13:08.480 --> 02:13:10.480]  I mean, they've done this in communist countries,
[02:13:10.480 --> 02:13:11.480]  in authoritarian countries.
[02:13:11.480 --> 02:13:14.480]  They pick certain groups and then make them denounce themselves.
[02:13:14.480 --> 02:13:17.480]  And the next is always forced labor and then prison.
[02:13:17.480 --> 02:13:19.480]  And this is being run by a guy that's
[02:13:19.480 --> 02:13:23.480]  overthrown countless countries who was a Nazi collaborator.
[02:13:23.480 --> 02:13:26.480]  And you're realizing it's Democratic Party,
[02:13:26.480 --> 02:13:29.480]  globalist, race-baiting, brainwashing,
[02:13:29.480 --> 02:13:32.480]  really reeducation camp garbage you're having to go through.
[02:13:32.480 --> 02:13:33.480]  Yeah.
[02:13:33.480 --> 02:13:36.480]  And some of my fellow employees, I heard them saying,
[02:13:36.480 --> 02:13:38.480]  wow, this makes sense.
[02:13:38.480 --> 02:13:39.480]  Or wow, I really understand.
[02:13:39.480 --> 02:13:41.480]  Or wow, I didn't know that they felt like that.
[02:13:41.480 --> 02:13:44.480]  And I'm like, how can you fall for this?
[02:13:44.480 --> 02:13:48.480]  And you know, it's just, it's unbelievable.
[02:13:48.480 --> 02:13:50.480]  So let's get back on track here.
[02:13:50.480 --> 02:13:54.480]  There is a video, oh goodness, this video.
[02:13:54.480 --> 02:13:58.480]  It is, I think it's number eight on that page.
[02:13:58.480 --> 02:14:03.480]  And it is by, I believe, a man called Nelson.
[02:14:03.480 --> 02:14:07.480]  My cat is messing with my stuff right now.
[02:14:07.480 --> 02:14:08.480]  Let me get to it.
[02:14:08.480 --> 02:14:10.480]  Do you have any questions for me while I look for this?
[02:14:10.480 --> 02:14:12.480]  No, I mean, I'm, radio losers are listening
[02:14:12.480 --> 02:14:14.480]  and I'm watching them play some of the videos.
[02:14:14.480 --> 02:14:15.480]  All right.
[02:14:15.480 --> 02:14:16.480]  You're doing a great job.
[02:14:16.480 --> 02:14:18.480]  I'm not back off your phone as a tabby.
[02:14:18.480 --> 02:14:19.480]  You're doing great.
[02:14:19.480 --> 02:14:20.480]  No, no, since you asked, I'm just telling you,
[02:14:20.480 --> 02:14:21.480]  it's a little overdriven,
[02:14:21.480 --> 02:14:22.480]  but other than that, you're awesome.
[02:14:22.480 --> 02:14:24.480]  And so I'm just sitting back listening and watching.
[02:14:24.480 --> 02:14:27.480]  And so most white people in this country,
[02:14:27.480 --> 02:14:30.480]  sure, sure, most white people in this country
[02:14:30.480 --> 02:14:32.480]  had no ancestors that had slaves.
[02:14:32.480 --> 02:14:35.480]  Most white people's ancestors came here after slavery.
[02:14:35.480 --> 02:14:40.480]  Only 2% had slaves previous to 1867, 1868.
[02:14:40.480 --> 02:14:43.480]  And literally, you'll read all the time about Polish
[02:14:43.480 --> 02:14:48.480]  or Eastern European immigrants being killed
[02:14:48.480 --> 02:14:50.480]  in different minority neighborhoods because they're white.
[02:14:50.480 --> 02:14:52.480]  And people think they owe reparations.
[02:14:52.480 --> 02:14:53.480]  It's total insanity.
[02:14:53.480 --> 02:14:57.480]  If my grandfather committed crimes, I'm not guilty.
[02:14:57.480 --> 02:14:59.480]  That's common sense, common law.
[02:14:59.480 --> 02:15:00.480]  So, but here's the deal.
[02:15:00.480 --> 02:15:02.480]  They don't mean well with any of this.
[02:15:02.480 --> 02:15:03.480]  We know what this is.
[02:15:03.480 --> 02:15:09.480]  This is college level SJW brainwashing
[02:15:09.480 --> 02:15:12.480]  to make everyone uncomfortable and to screw everybody over.
[02:15:12.480 --> 02:15:16.480]  I mean, the reality is, Starbucks, you walk in,
[02:15:16.480 --> 02:15:17.480]  you're working hard.
[02:15:17.480 --> 02:15:18.480]  I've worked behind counters before.
[02:15:18.480 --> 02:15:21.480]  You're trying to do your job, keep the machines clean,
[02:15:21.480 --> 02:15:23.480]  give the people their stuff, be nice to them
[02:15:23.480 --> 02:15:24.480]  so they're happy, move on.
[02:15:24.480 --> 02:15:26.480]  I don't look at what color you are, where you're from.
[02:15:26.480 --> 02:15:29.480]  Even if you're a good-looking chick and I'm single,
[02:15:29.480 --> 02:15:31.480]  I'm not, I'm just in the mode of working.
[02:15:31.480 --> 02:15:33.480]  I'm not even going to, you know, ask you out on a date.
[02:15:33.480 --> 02:15:35.480]  And so I know what it's like to work in these places.
[02:15:35.480 --> 02:15:36.480]  I've worked in restaurants.
[02:15:36.480 --> 02:15:37.480]  I've worked behind the counter.
[02:15:37.480 --> 02:15:39.480]  I had a place that served coffee.
[02:15:39.480 --> 02:15:42.480]  And so we're going to talk with this whistleblower.
[02:15:42.480 --> 02:15:44.480]  He's doing a great job on the other side
[02:15:44.480 --> 02:15:45.480]  and go through some of these videos.
[02:15:45.480 --> 02:15:47.480]  She's gotten lined up for us.
[02:15:47.480 --> 02:15:50.480]  Stay with us, infowars.com, newswars.com,
[02:15:50.480 --> 02:15:53.480]  Tamara's News Today, the number one hated news source
[02:15:53.480 --> 02:16:22.480]  by Globalist.
[02:16:24.480 --> 02:16:27.480]  This is Dan Pilla. Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[02:16:27.480 --> 02:16:29.480]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[02:16:29.480 --> 02:16:32.480]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[02:16:32.480 --> 02:16:34.480]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[02:16:34.480 --> 02:16:36.480]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you,
[02:16:36.480 --> 02:16:38.480]  there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[02:16:38.480 --> 02:16:42.480]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[02:16:42.480 --> 02:16:44.480]  With the IRS's new programs,
[02:16:44.480 --> 02:16:46.480]  there's never been a better time to solve your problem.
[02:16:46.480 --> 02:16:50.480]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX, that's 800-34-NO-TAX,

[02:17:21.480 --> 02:17:24.480]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look
[02:17:24.480 --> 02:17:26.480]  and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:17:26.480 --> 02:17:28.480]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.

[02:17:34.480 --> 02:17:54.480]  way to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[02:17:56.480 --> 02:17:58.480]  President Trump gave a speech on Friday
[02:17:58.480 --> 02:18:00.480]  at the Naval Academy for their commencement
[02:18:00.480 --> 02:18:03.480]  and said America is back.
[02:18:03.480 --> 02:18:05.480]  Hollywood does not have the megaphone anymore,
[02:18:05.480 --> 02:18:08.480]  but patriots that believe in real Americana
[02:18:08.480 --> 02:18:12.480]  are back in charge and the world is taking notice.

[02:18:37.480 --> 02:18:39.480]  and other patriots, not just here but worldwide,

[02:18:44.480 --> 02:18:46.480]  support of basic freedom.
[02:18:46.480 --> 02:18:50.480]  Huge Memorial Day specials are running throughout this weekend
[02:18:50.480 --> 02:18:52.480]  until the month of May ends.
[02:18:52.480 --> 02:18:55.480]  And at infowarstore.com and infowarslife.com
[02:18:55.480 --> 02:18:57.480]  take advantage today.
[02:18:57.480 --> 02:19:00.480]  Patrick, in the great nation of Australia,
[02:19:00.480 --> 02:19:02.480]  you're on the air worldwide. Thanks for holding.
[02:19:02.480 --> 02:19:03.480]  Hey, Alex, mate.
[02:19:03.480 --> 02:19:05.480]  I've been following you since I was 14,
[02:19:05.480 --> 02:19:07.480]  and I'm 32 now.
[02:19:07.480 --> 02:19:10.480]  I remember back when info wars and prison planet,
[02:19:10.480 --> 02:19:12.480]  it was just blue text on a white screen
[02:19:12.480 --> 02:19:15.480]  and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet
[02:19:15.480 --> 02:19:17.480]  and I thought it was pretty cool and read all the books
[02:19:17.480 --> 02:19:20.480]  and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests
[02:19:20.480 --> 02:19:22.480]  and I've been using your products
[02:19:22.480 --> 02:19:24.480]  since the first iteration of Survival Shield
[02:19:24.480 --> 02:19:26.480]  and since then I'm on the X2,
[02:19:26.480 --> 02:19:28.480]  the SuperMail Vitality Decay Man,
[02:19:28.480 --> 02:19:32.480]  the real red pill, micro-ZX body, it's all amazing.
[02:19:32.480 --> 02:19:33.480]  Thank you, brother.
[02:19:33.480 --> 02:19:36.480]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much,
[02:19:36.480 --> 02:19:38.480]  it's like you're just detoxing the mind,
[02:19:38.480 --> 02:19:41.480]  you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit
[02:19:41.480 --> 02:19:43.480]  and it's just the more you know God,
[02:19:43.480 --> 02:19:46.480]  the more you fear God, but the more you chase God
[02:19:46.480 --> 02:19:49.480]  and I wanted to say that it's an honour to stand side by side
[02:19:49.480 --> 02:19:51.480]  with you, the crew and the listeners out there,
[02:19:51.480 --> 02:19:58.480]  1776 World War.
[02:20:21.480 --> 02:20:34.480]  We may have to reschedule our guests because of sound issues
[02:20:34.480 --> 02:20:36.480]  because I want her to be crystal clear what she's saying,
[02:20:36.480 --> 02:20:39.480]  it's so important, but we'll finish up here.
[02:20:39.480 --> 02:20:41.480]  It's just astounding when you get into the level
[02:20:41.480 --> 02:20:43.480]  of brainwashing that's going on
[02:20:43.480 --> 02:20:45.480]  and the level of white guilt spewing
[02:20:45.480 --> 02:20:47.480]  by these billionaires that are pretty much tax exempt.
[02:20:47.480 --> 02:20:50.480]  This is their evacuation play,
[02:20:50.480 --> 02:20:52.480]  this is their rearguard action while they rob us
[02:20:52.480 --> 02:20:54.480]  to get us all fighting with each other
[02:20:54.480 --> 02:20:56.480]  and again, this is an admitted cultural situation.
[02:20:56.480 --> 02:21:00.480]  So they closed for a day last week to beyond virtue signal.
[02:21:00.480 --> 02:21:04.480]  Remember they tried last year to make white patrons admit
[02:21:04.480 --> 02:21:08.480]  they were racist or you know, talk about all this stuff
[02:21:08.480 --> 02:21:13.480]  and again, all this is designed to do is to create division
[02:21:13.480 --> 02:21:15.480]  and it's all malice type brainwashing,
[02:21:15.480 --> 02:21:17.480]  all the iconographies, very, very communist,
[02:21:17.480 --> 02:21:20.480]  of course, directed by billionaires.
[02:21:20.480 --> 02:21:23.480]  And then coming up after she leaves us,
[02:21:23.480 --> 02:21:26.480]  we have Laura Loomer joining us with huge new developments.
[02:21:26.480 --> 02:21:30.480]  Turns out three women, just as we first broke inside the hotel room
[02:21:30.480 --> 02:21:33.480]  with the supposed shooter, Islamic connections,
[02:21:33.480 --> 02:21:35.480]  that cover up is unraveling.
[02:21:35.480 --> 02:21:40.480]  So again, oh, they have racist rehabilitation.
[02:21:40.480 --> 02:21:42.480]  Isn't that nice when they rehabilitate you
[02:21:42.480 --> 02:21:44.480]  and they teach you how you're bad
[02:21:44.480 --> 02:21:46.480]  and then I've noticed they've had some of these racist
[02:21:46.480 --> 02:21:48.480]  rehabilitators on the news lately
[02:21:48.480 --> 02:21:50.480]  and all they do is spout how bad white people are.
[02:21:50.480 --> 02:21:52.480]  So I guess the rehabilitators are racist
[02:21:52.480 --> 02:21:54.480]  and then tell you how whites are inherently bad
[02:21:54.480 --> 02:21:56.480]  and then you get Stockholm syndrome
[02:21:56.480 --> 02:21:58.480]  and then tell them how bad you are.
[02:21:58.480 --> 02:22:01.480]  So during this day long situation, ma'am,
[02:22:01.480 --> 02:22:02.480]  we're not going to say your name,
[02:22:02.480 --> 02:22:05.480]  you're a Starbucks whistleblower from the admitted rehabilitation.
[02:22:05.480 --> 02:22:07.480]  That means reeducation camp.
[02:22:07.480 --> 02:22:09.480]  So you're in this thing.
[02:22:09.480 --> 02:22:11.480]  What did they do during the rehabilitation?
[02:22:11.480 --> 02:22:14.480]  Did they offer if any of you white people are bad racist
[02:22:14.480 --> 02:22:16.480]  and only whites can be racist?
[02:22:16.480 --> 02:22:18.480]  We've got some rehabilitation for you.
[02:22:18.480 --> 02:22:21.480]  I mean, it pretty much felt like they were pointing the finger
[02:22:21.480 --> 02:22:24.480]  and what was funny was there was no other races that were involved.
[02:22:24.480 --> 02:22:27.480]  It was only black versus white.
[02:22:27.480 --> 02:22:29.480]  No Hispanic, no Asian, nothing.
[02:22:29.480 --> 02:22:31.480]  It was just black versus white.
[02:22:31.480 --> 02:22:34.480]  And then we got to this video by Stanley Nelson,
[02:22:34.480 --> 02:22:37.480]  which I'd like to mention he was the director and writer
[02:22:37.480 --> 02:22:39.480]  of the documentary The Black Panther,
[02:22:39.480 --> 02:22:41.480]  Vanguard of the Revolution.
[02:22:41.480 --> 02:22:46.480]  Of course, he was given a medal by, guess who, Barack Obama.
[02:22:46.480 --> 02:22:48.480]  So he had this video.
[02:22:48.480 --> 02:22:50.480]  He made this video for Starbucks.
[02:22:50.480 --> 02:22:52.480]  Specifically, it's called The Story of Access.
[02:22:52.480 --> 02:22:54.480]  You can find it right on the website.
[02:22:54.480 --> 02:22:56.480]  And we had to watch it all together.
[02:22:56.480 --> 02:22:57.480]  It was so uncomfortable.
[02:22:57.480 --> 02:22:59.480]  They showed horrible scenes from the 60s,
[02:22:59.480 --> 02:23:03.480]  showing discrimination against blacks in public places,
[02:23:03.480 --> 02:23:06.480]  as well as more recent events, quote, on cell phones.
[02:23:06.480 --> 02:23:10.480]  But the most damaging was the interviews they had with black Americans.
[02:23:10.480 --> 02:23:13.480]  And the common theme was that they can't leave the house
[02:23:13.480 --> 02:23:17.480]  without feeling judged or like they were going to be caught stealing
[02:23:17.480 --> 02:23:20.480]  or that they were going to be afraid.
[02:23:20.480 --> 02:23:24.480]  And one female even said that she wishes she could leave the house
[02:23:24.480 --> 02:23:28.480]  just as normal as that white guy does.
[02:23:28.480 --> 02:23:32.480]  And I just couldn't believe that they would not be able to take their lives
[02:23:32.480 --> 02:23:35.480]  in their own hands and say, I am not a victim.
[02:23:35.480 --> 02:23:38.480]  I'm going to go out and I'm going to live my life to the fullest
[02:23:38.480 --> 02:23:40.480]  and no one's going to judge me.
[02:23:40.480 --> 02:23:42.480]  Can't if no one says it perfectly.
[02:23:42.480 --> 02:23:44.480]  These victims just want to be victims.
[02:23:44.480 --> 02:23:46.480]  And that's it. That's all they want.
[02:23:46.480 --> 02:23:48.480]  Oh, you just hit it on the head.
[02:23:48.480 --> 02:23:51.480]  The real victims here are the people being brainwashed
[02:23:51.480 --> 02:23:54.480]  that they're victims, not the white people being told they're racist.
[02:23:54.480 --> 02:23:57.480]  That's bad enough to just try to go work at a coffee place
[02:23:57.480 --> 02:23:59.480]  and not get promoted because of the good job you do,
[02:23:59.480 --> 02:24:01.480]  but think everyone's out to get you.
[02:24:01.480 --> 02:24:04.480]  They're teaching total mental illness.
[02:24:04.480 --> 02:24:08.480]  Completely. My favorite quote was from a black male in that video
[02:24:08.480 --> 02:24:11.480]  and he was talking about how he was so heartbroken
[02:24:11.480 --> 02:24:15.480]  that he would have to tell his son that he has to enter this world.
[02:24:15.480 --> 02:24:18.480]  And this world is a muddy river of racism
[02:24:18.480 --> 02:24:22.480]  and he would have to walk through that muddy river of racism.
[02:24:22.480 --> 02:24:25.480]  Has nothing changed since the Civil Rights Act?
[02:24:25.480 --> 02:24:27.480]  Has nothing changed in America?
[02:24:27.480 --> 02:24:30.480]  We don't get credit for anything.
[02:24:30.480 --> 02:24:36.480]  Just makes me think that if a small percentage of the black Americans
[02:24:36.480 --> 02:24:40.480]  feel like this, this can be really critical to our future.
[02:24:40.480 --> 02:24:43.480]  They have to wake up. They have to be red-pilled.
[02:24:43.480 --> 02:24:47.480]  Well, you know what? We had a little bit of audio problem earlier.
[02:24:47.480 --> 02:24:52.480]  I want to get you back on for a full 30 minutes tomorrow.
[02:24:52.480 --> 02:24:55.480]  I mean, I think we should make a bigger deal about this from your perspective.
[02:24:55.480 --> 02:25:00.480]  And I think we should really cause a cascade at showtipsandinfowars.com.
[02:25:00.480 --> 02:25:03.480]  I think we still got whistleblowers at infowars.com active.
[02:25:03.480 --> 02:25:05.480]  Can you guys tell me if that's active? Thanks.
[02:25:05.480 --> 02:25:07.480]  Show that it should be.
[02:25:07.480 --> 02:25:09.480]  As soon as we get rid of old emails, if they get overspammed.
[02:25:09.480 --> 02:25:13.480]  Because we should really get a bunch of Starbucks employees together
[02:25:13.480 --> 02:25:18.480]  who don't like doing this so you can be heard from.
[02:25:18.480 --> 02:25:20.480]  But really, it's the Democratic Party coming in
[02:25:20.480 --> 02:25:22.480]  knowing that we're a loving country.
[02:25:22.480 --> 02:25:24.480]  We're the most open country in the world.
[02:25:24.480 --> 02:25:27.480]  The average young person's been brought up to hate themselves if they're white,
[02:25:27.480 --> 02:25:29.480]  if they're black to think everybody's out to get them,
[02:25:29.480 --> 02:25:31.480]  which becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[02:25:31.480 --> 02:25:34.480]  And so you now just throw salt in the wounds.
[02:25:34.480 --> 02:25:37.480]  And then, of course, it's all Democratic Party run with George Soros,
[02:25:37.480 --> 02:25:39.480]  who's a Nazi collaborator.
[02:25:39.480 --> 02:25:42.480]  I mean, you know, what about his rehabilitation?
[02:25:42.480 --> 02:25:44.480]  Yeah.
[02:25:44.480 --> 02:25:46.480]  I mean, it's just next level.
[02:25:46.480 --> 02:25:49.480]  And what's funny is at the end of the day of the training,
[02:25:49.480 --> 02:25:53.480]  we were left with, I would say probably about 1% of strategy
[02:25:53.480 --> 02:25:56.480]  on how to deal with problem customers.
[02:25:56.480 --> 02:26:00.480]  Everything else was pretty much race-baiting, victim,
[02:26:00.480 --> 02:26:02.480]  shove-in-your-face propaganda.
[02:26:02.480 --> 02:26:04.480]  Unbelievable.
[02:26:04.480 --> 02:26:07.480]  And you could see that the pressure from Black Lives Matter
[02:26:07.480 --> 02:26:09.480]  is ultimately going to tank this company.
[02:26:09.480 --> 02:26:13.480]  Because now, heck, I'm going to tell everyone to come in with their chessboards,
[02:26:13.480 --> 02:26:16.480]  their Dunkin' Donuts, and they should just have lunch right in Starbucks.
[02:26:16.480 --> 02:26:19.480]  Because, heck, we invite every single person who walks through that store
[02:26:19.480 --> 02:26:21.480]  as a customer now.
[02:26:21.480 --> 02:26:23.480]  And here's my problem.
[02:26:23.480 --> 02:26:25.480]  Here's my problem.
[02:26:25.480 --> 02:26:27.480]  Starbucks is really strong coffee.
[02:26:27.480 --> 02:26:29.480]  And they're usually pretty quick and everything.
[02:26:29.480 --> 02:26:31.480]  And they've got some good desserts and little side dishes.
[02:26:31.480 --> 02:26:34.480]  And so, around the road, it's better than a lot of fast food places with my kids.
[02:26:34.480 --> 02:26:37.480]  So I'll pull in and get them a croissant, get them a, you know, milk or something.
[02:26:37.480 --> 02:26:40.480]  But I don't want to go in there now because it's like,
[02:26:40.480 --> 02:26:43.480]  literally walking into a re-education camp, it's walking into all this craziness.
[02:26:43.480 --> 02:26:46.480]  I've had white members of my crew go in and say,
[02:26:46.480 --> 02:26:48.480]  I hear you're giving away free drinks.
[02:26:48.480 --> 02:26:51.480]  You know, to prove you're not racist and they give them a free coffee.
[02:26:51.480 --> 02:26:54.480]  You know, to my crew member that's got red hair and blue eyes.
[02:26:54.480 --> 02:26:56.480]  It's insanity.
[02:26:56.480 --> 02:26:59.480]  And it's building this idea that if you say you're being racist, you're being sexist,
[02:26:59.480 --> 02:27:01.480]  it's like a jack-in-the-box and money pops out of it.
[02:27:01.480 --> 02:27:03.480]  It's insane.
[02:27:03.480 --> 02:27:05.480]  Mm-hmm.
[02:27:05.480 --> 02:27:08.480]  I would say if Starbucks actually really cared about race and the problem in this country,
[02:27:08.480 --> 02:27:10.480]  they would stop funding Planned Parenthood.
[02:27:10.480 --> 02:27:12.480]  You know, but they won't do that.
[02:27:12.480 --> 02:27:14.480]  They won't say it.
[02:27:14.480 --> 02:27:20.480]  Because they are just so ruled by this left-leaning people.
[02:27:20.480 --> 02:27:22.480]  Well, they want to dominate us.
[02:27:22.480 --> 02:27:23.480]  They want to control the narrative.
[02:27:23.480 --> 02:27:27.480]  They want to define everything to the point of saying that we can't say mother or father.
[02:27:27.480 --> 02:27:30.480]  Again, in school entrance exams and everywhere else.
[02:27:30.480 --> 02:27:33.480]  I mean, if that is an occult, imagine if you read a book 20 years ago,
[02:27:33.480 --> 02:27:35.480]  we're in the future, you can't say mother or father.
[02:27:35.480 --> 02:27:39.480]  And in the future, they say masculinity and femininity is a myth.
[02:27:39.480 --> 02:27:43.480]  And in the future, you know, 30% of the kids are on Prozac drugs.
[02:27:43.480 --> 02:27:44.480]  I mean, they've done this.
[02:27:44.480 --> 02:27:46.480]  They have partially taken over.
[02:27:46.480 --> 02:27:50.480]  And now they think we're trying to struggle loose of this and they're really upset.
[02:27:50.480 --> 02:27:52.480]  What do the other employees think?
[02:27:52.480 --> 02:27:53.480]  Do they buy into it?
[02:27:53.480 --> 02:27:54.480]  What percentage bought into it?
[02:27:54.480 --> 02:27:57.480]  I would have to say 90% bought into it.
[02:27:57.480 --> 02:28:03.480]  I have about maybe one other patriotic employee.
[02:28:03.480 --> 02:28:06.480]  And we talked and we definitely feel the same way.
[02:28:06.480 --> 02:28:09.480]  But everyone else was just all into it.
[02:28:09.480 --> 02:28:11.480]  Oh, I can't believe they feel that way.
[02:28:11.480 --> 02:28:14.480]  I'm going to have to act differently now because I feel so bad.
[02:28:14.480 --> 02:28:18.480]  By the way, when we had a voice changer on you,
[02:28:18.480 --> 02:28:19.480]  I apologize.
[02:28:19.480 --> 02:28:20.480]  Go ahead.
[02:28:20.480 --> 02:28:21.480]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:28:21.480 --> 02:28:25.480]  I was going to say their white privilege has literally been activated.
[02:28:25.480 --> 02:28:29.480]  They've been turned on just like robots.
[02:28:29.480 --> 02:28:36.480]  And unfortunately, I think this means that like companies, big, big companies, corporations,
[02:28:36.480 --> 02:28:38.480]  we're going to have to stop spending our money.
[02:28:38.480 --> 02:28:41.480]  We're going to have to think about when we open up our wallet, who we're supporting
[02:28:41.480 --> 02:28:42.480]  and who they're supporting.
[02:28:42.480 --> 02:28:43.480]  That's my next question.
[02:28:43.480 --> 02:28:44.480]  Laura Lerner is coming up.
[02:28:44.480 --> 02:28:45.480]  Come back in a few more minutes with us.
[02:28:45.480 --> 02:28:54.480]  What do we do next as a Starbucks whistleblower from your pretty smart ideas?
[02:28:54.480 --> 02:28:58.480]  We call it the crapper, water closet, outhouse or bathroom.
[02:28:58.480 --> 02:29:00.480]  But where do you go when there's nowhere to go?
[02:29:00.480 --> 02:29:02.480]  The answer is the Biffy Bag.
[02:29:02.480 --> 02:29:06.480]  The Biffy Bag is a pocket sized disposable toilet that fits in your glove box,
[02:29:06.480 --> 02:29:09.480]  tackle box, toolbox, backpack or purse.
[02:29:09.480 --> 02:29:14.480]  The Biffy Bag has everything you need for a sanitary and comfortable relief experience.
[02:29:14.480 --> 02:29:18.480]  It's ready to use in just seconds and just toss it in the trash when you're done.
[02:29:18.480 --> 02:29:20.480]  It's your Biffy in a Jiffy.
[02:29:20.480 --> 02:29:21.480]  BiffyBag.com.
[02:29:21.480 --> 02:29:24.480]  B-I-F-F-Y-B-A-G.com.
[02:29:24.480 --> 02:29:29.480]  Fellow Patriots, my name is Todd Savage, founder of Black Rifle Real Estate.com.
[02:29:29.480 --> 02:29:35.480]  Like you, I was a prisoner of the out left sanctuary state until one day I chose to leave my family to freedom.
[02:29:35.480 --> 02:29:40.480]  Today we live on a sustainable 20 acre homestead where we shoot, hunt, garden and homeschool our children
[02:29:40.480 --> 02:29:43.480]  without the tyranny of the nanny state looking over us.
[02:29:43.480 --> 02:29:46.480]  If you're ready to flee the city to the freedom of Idaho or Montana,
[02:29:46.480 --> 02:29:48.480]  our Black Rifle Real Estate team is here to help.
[02:29:48.480 --> 02:29:50.480]  Go to BlackRifleRealEstate.com.
[02:29:50.480 --> 02:30:13.480]  That's BlackRifleRealEstate.com.
[02:30:21.480 --> 02:30:25.480]  They began studying this effect in published trials
[02:30:25.480 --> 02:30:28.480]  and decades later we now have the fruit of this research,
[02:30:28.480 --> 02:30:33.480]  a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[02:30:33.480 --> 02:30:36.480]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[02:30:36.480 --> 02:30:38.480]  It is not an antihistamine.
[02:30:38.480 --> 02:30:43.480]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase,
[02:30:43.480 --> 02:30:48.480]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[02:30:48.480 --> 02:30:51.480]  If you're ready to flee, go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[02:30:51.480 --> 02:30:56.480]  Head to InfowarsLife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[02:30:56.480 --> 02:31:02.480]  InfowarsLife and InfowarsLife.com is extremely excited to announce our latest release,
[02:31:02.480 --> 02:31:06.480]  Winter Sun, a revolutionary type of vitamin D3.
[02:31:06.480 --> 02:31:11.480]  Winter Sun is a premium quality vitamin D3 nutritional supplement.
[02:31:11.480 --> 02:31:15.480]  It is produced by extracting oil from healthy nutrient dense plants known as lichens.
[02:31:15.480 --> 02:31:18.480]  The batch is analyzed for purity and D3 content.
[02:31:18.480 --> 02:31:20.480]  It's completely free of toxins and allergens.
[02:31:20.480 --> 02:31:24.480]  Simply put, if you want the best at an extremely low price, this is it.
[02:31:24.480 --> 02:31:28.480]  Winter Sun is the result of our pursuit of the best source of vitamin D3.
[02:31:28.480 --> 02:31:31.480]  The research and development took over two years,
[02:31:31.480 --> 02:31:33.480]  but the result, as verified by independent laboratories,
[02:31:33.480 --> 02:31:37.480]  is the best vegan vitamin D3 product in the world.
[02:31:37.480 --> 02:31:42.480]  Read the facts at InfowarsLife.com about Winter Sun vitamin D3.
[02:31:42.480 --> 02:31:47.480]  Only does vitamin D3 promote a healthy mood, but vitamin D supports our memory and brain function.
[02:31:47.480 --> 02:31:49.480]  Something the globalists are targeting.
[02:31:49.480 --> 02:31:55.480]  Visit Infowars.com today or call 888-253-3139.
[02:31:59.480 --> 02:32:05.480]  Years ago, InfowarsLife created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[02:32:05.480 --> 02:32:08.480]  As the years went on and more toxins were pumped into the environment,
[02:32:08.480 --> 02:32:12.480]  our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[02:32:12.480 --> 02:32:16.480]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula,
[02:32:16.480 --> 02:32:21.480]  a unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.
[02:32:21.480 --> 02:32:24.480]  There's no better product to help your body fight back.
[02:32:24.480 --> 02:32:28.480]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body,
[02:32:28.480 --> 02:32:33.480]  supports your digestive tract, and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[02:32:33.480 --> 02:32:37.480]  Powered by an impressive list of ingredients, including grapefruit seed extract,
[02:32:37.480 --> 02:32:39.480]  poudarco bark, and grape seed extract,
[02:32:39.480 --> 02:32:45.480]  our formula is fueled by ingredients that stood the test of time as powerful microbalancing properties.
[02:32:45.480 --> 02:32:50.480]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved MycoZX Plus today at InfowarsLife.com.
[02:32:50.480 --> 02:33:08.480]  That's InfowarsLife.com.
[02:33:08.480 --> 02:33:23.480]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:23.480 --> 02:33:29.480]  When I say bombshell, I mean bombshell information is what Laura Loomer is coming up in about five minutes with.
[02:33:29.480 --> 02:33:32.480]  But the lady we have on now, we had a voice changer on her earlier,
[02:33:32.480 --> 02:33:35.480]  but it was kind of malfunctioning so you couldn't understand everything she was saying.
[02:33:35.480 --> 02:33:38.480]  She's very articulate. She's a Starbucks manager.
[02:33:38.480 --> 02:33:43.480]  She said now she doesn't even really care if they find out who she is because the website came out this week.
[02:33:43.480 --> 02:33:46.480]  They had the brainwashing and the closing last week.
[02:33:46.480 --> 02:33:51.480]  And so I wanted her to recap just what this was like, what she witnessed, and what she saw.
[02:33:51.480 --> 02:33:56.480]  Because when you study history, when you study authoritarianism, when you study communist countries,
[02:33:56.480 --> 02:34:01.480]  you know exactly what this is, but they even call it racist rehabilitation.
[02:34:01.480 --> 02:34:06.480]  And they're making you watch videos showing white people saying we're rehabilitating your racism.
[02:34:06.480 --> 02:34:10.480]  I mean, this is so condescending. This is so shit.
[02:34:10.480 --> 02:34:12.480]  And you know what it's meant to do, right?
[02:34:12.480 --> 02:34:15.480]  Weak-minded people turn into leftist slaves.
[02:34:15.480 --> 02:34:17.480]  Whatever the new craze is, they follow.
[02:34:17.480 --> 02:34:21.480]  But a good portion of white people, not a majority, not even a big minority,
[02:34:21.480 --> 02:34:23.480]  but a good portion become racist.
[02:34:23.480 --> 02:34:32.480]  I grew up in Dallas around people of every color, and I've seen way more racism today
[02:34:32.480 --> 02:34:36.480]  and more and more hype of racism by all sides than I did back then.
[02:34:36.480 --> 02:34:40.480]  And that's because Obama did it on purpose and the media did. You can watch him.
[02:34:40.480 --> 02:34:44.480]  That's all they do is push this crud and then you get the WikiLeaks and again, go read them.
[02:34:44.480 --> 02:34:47.480]  It says we're going to cause culture war. It's all we've got left.
[02:34:47.480 --> 02:34:50.480]  Hillary's calling people baristas and they're poor and they want free stuff.
[02:34:50.480 --> 02:34:54.480]  She's calling everybody poor scum. And she says, what do I do to this top professor?
[02:34:54.480 --> 02:34:59.480]  And he goes, accelerate the culture war. That's what this is.
[02:34:59.480 --> 02:35:03.480]  And like she was saying, at the end of it, as a manager,
[02:35:03.480 --> 02:35:06.480]  she's sitting there watching things worse off than it was
[02:35:06.480 --> 02:35:09.480]  and no training what to do when a schizophrenic comes in and starts crapping on the floor.
[02:35:09.480 --> 02:35:12.480]  No training what to do when people are in the stalls,
[02:35:12.480 --> 02:35:17.480]  let me tell you something, working in retail, your problem isn't black people.
[02:35:17.480 --> 02:35:21.480]  Because black people usually aren't junkies. I've worked in retail.
[02:35:21.480 --> 02:35:26.480]  It's junkies and they're usually white because you know what junkies do
[02:35:26.480 --> 02:35:31.480]  and they usually take a big shot a lot of times. They throw up everywhere.
[02:35:31.480 --> 02:35:35.480]  Yes, I've worked at a gas station. I've worked at a coffee, you know, tea shop.
[02:35:35.480 --> 02:35:40.480]  I've worked in retail and man, let me tell you, I worked a little hardware store
[02:35:40.480 --> 02:35:44.480]  and twice opened up the back door in the morning and there'd be homeless people in there
[02:35:44.480 --> 02:35:49.480]  drunk off their butt and crapped all over the floor. And guess what? Clean the crap up.
[02:35:49.480 --> 02:35:57.480]  So anybody that's worked in retail knows your problem in black people in the bathroom.
[02:35:57.480 --> 02:36:00.480]  Now in some big inner city areas where it's like 90% black,
[02:36:00.480 --> 02:36:03.480]  of course your problem is going to be black people because it's all black people.
[02:36:03.480 --> 02:36:05.480]  You're going to have bad people in any area.
[02:36:05.480 --> 02:36:09.480]  Whether it's almost completely white area, you're going to have white criminals coming in too.
[02:36:09.480 --> 02:36:13.480]  But you're almost a completely black area and you say you're a Chinese shop or something.
[02:36:13.480 --> 02:36:17.480]  Yeah, those places have problems. The community has issues with it.
[02:36:17.480 --> 02:36:22.480]  And so, yeah, that's there. But Starbucks? Correct me if I'm wrong.
[02:36:22.480 --> 02:36:24.480]  We're going to hold Laura Lumer into the next hour. I appreciate her holding,
[02:36:24.480 --> 02:36:26.480]  but we had audio problems with you and this is so critical.
[02:36:26.480 --> 02:36:29.480]  I don't know how long you've worked in retail or worked at Starbucks,
[02:36:29.480 --> 02:36:32.480]  but I'm not going to say where you work, even though you don't mind it,
[02:36:32.480 --> 02:36:37.480]  since there's no retaliation. But am I right to say your problem isn't black people in the bathrooms.
[02:36:37.480 --> 02:36:42.480]  I mean, isn't it usually just homeless people of all colors or junkies or am I wrong?
[02:36:42.480 --> 02:36:48.480]  It is not a particular race at all. And what I found funny was with the incident in Philadelphia,
[02:36:48.480 --> 02:36:53.480]  that store has a localized problem. Every other store doesn't have that same problem.
[02:36:53.480 --> 02:36:57.480]  So to apply this training to every store seems a little bit ridiculous.
[02:36:57.480 --> 02:37:03.480]  We don't have people loitering that much. We don't have a high black population.
[02:37:03.480 --> 02:37:08.480]  And even if we did, when we do have people in the store who happen to be black Americans,
[02:37:08.480 --> 02:37:12.480]  guess what? They're getting great service because we are a great store.
[02:37:12.480 --> 02:37:17.480]  So that one issue with that one store has to affect every other. And you're right.
[02:37:17.480 --> 02:37:21.480]  This is their last little grasp of how they can control.
[02:37:21.480 --> 02:37:25.480]  They're going to pick up any of the stragglers, any of the people that could be turned,
[02:37:25.480 --> 02:37:29.480]  minds changed, they're going to, they're going to turn them.
[02:37:29.480 --> 02:37:32.480]  I'll say this, you know, the Starbucks where they call them on the two black guys,
[02:37:32.480 --> 02:37:35.480]  those guys see all the Rosa Parks movies. They want to recreate that.
[02:37:35.480 --> 02:37:39.480]  They go in, it violates the policy. You know, they're kind of, they get kicked out.
[02:37:39.480 --> 02:37:43.480]  They were looking for that. But if I was sitting there and the store wasn't full
[02:37:43.480 --> 02:37:47.480]  and two guys want to sit there for an hour, I'm not going to give them what they want.
[02:37:47.480 --> 02:37:50.480]  I'm going to say, fine, sit there and enjoy yourself.
[02:37:50.480 --> 02:37:54.480]  You know, but again, that's just me. If I was a manager, I wouldn't be looking for trouble.
[02:37:54.480 --> 02:37:58.480]  But is this a nationwide incident? Because again, I don't know where you're at.
[02:37:58.480 --> 02:38:04.480]  I just know doing some retail and things in Dallas that I had problems with druggies
[02:38:04.480 --> 02:38:10.480]  and they were mainly white kids, you know, 25 years old
[02:38:10.480 --> 02:38:13.480]  that were, that were trying to go take drugs in the bathroom.
[02:38:13.480 --> 02:38:17.480]  So I just, I just don't even understand where all this is coming from.
[02:38:17.480 --> 02:38:22.480]  It's just their grasp of control. And like you said, we didn't get much training
[02:38:22.480 --> 02:38:26.480]  on how to deal with these people who are problems, maybe druggies or anyone in the store.
[02:38:26.480 --> 02:38:29.480]  But don't worry because there's going to be future trainings.
[02:38:29.480 --> 02:38:35.480]  They said that this was only the beginning. So I cannot wait to see what comes of this.
[02:38:35.480 --> 02:38:39.480]  And we're talking about the future. What can we do? What can we do to change this?
[02:38:39.480 --> 02:38:42.480]  I cannot be the only Patriot who works at Starbucks. I know it.
[02:38:42.480 --> 02:38:49.480]  Yeah, some estimates are, some estimates are there's up to 300,000 homeless or quasi-homeless people.
[02:38:49.480 --> 02:38:53.480]  I saw in the LA Times last month, who knows if it's true, but hundreds of thousands of people are homeless.
[02:38:53.480 --> 02:39:00.480]  Now what Starbucks going to do when the homeless can demand to come in and use their bathrooms, their Wi-Fi,
[02:39:00.480 --> 02:39:03.480]  because I see homeless with laptops, you name it, what are they going to do?
[02:39:03.480 --> 02:39:09.480]  It's going to ruin Starbucks. I don't want to go into a Starbucks with 20 homeless people in there with, I mean, it's crazy.
[02:39:09.480 --> 02:39:12.480]  And I won't want to work there when it's like that either.
[02:39:12.480 --> 02:39:15.480]  They're going to have to hire a whole bunch of illegal immigrants.
[02:39:15.480 --> 02:39:20.480]  Let me ask you this. Have you had a problem with mentally ill people coming in?
[02:39:20.480 --> 02:39:25.480]  Because that was the other big problem was there was always a couple of, you know, local people who are schizophrenic or whatever.
[02:39:25.480 --> 02:39:28.480]  We don't have mental hospitals anymore, state hospitals, so they roam around the streets.
[02:39:28.480 --> 02:39:34.480]  I mean, did you ever have a cup? Are there a couple of mentally ill, homeless people, you know, that are kind of an ongoing issue?
[02:39:34.480 --> 02:39:36.480]  Of course. Of course that happens randomly.
[02:39:36.480 --> 02:39:42.480]  And we always deal with the situation very honestly and very truthfully and in a very nice way.
[02:39:42.480 --> 02:39:48.480]  Yeah, it's very sad. I mean, I know that when I work, it's just super embarrassing sounding,
[02:39:48.480 --> 02:39:52.480]  but I did work at Baskin Robbins for six months in high school in Austin.
[02:39:52.480 --> 02:39:56.480]  And after I moved out here from Dallas and pretty good panjoper fast food.
[02:39:56.480 --> 02:40:00.480]  But man, we had a couple of old homeless drunks, kind of like the end of old white hobos.
[02:40:00.480 --> 02:40:04.480]  They were kind of the classic hobo and those guys would come in and I would.
[02:40:04.480 --> 02:40:07.480]  A lot of times they didn't have any money. I'd buy them ice cream myself.
[02:40:07.480 --> 02:40:09.480]  So I guess that's kind of the softy in me.
[02:40:09.480 --> 02:40:13.480]  Well, listen, we want to have you back to go through all this to talk about the next level of it.
[02:40:13.480 --> 02:40:16.480]  Any other points you'd like to add?
[02:40:16.480 --> 02:40:21.480]  I just want to say that maybe us Patriots who work at Starbucks should open up our own Starbucks.
[02:40:21.480 --> 02:40:23.480]  Maybe call it, I don't know.
[02:40:23.480 --> 02:40:24.480]  Free bucks.
[02:40:24.480 --> 02:40:32.480]  Yeah, you know, or maybe our training next time could be a little right-leaning instead of completely left-leaning.
[02:40:32.480 --> 02:40:35.480]  Or even in the middle, I would take a balance.
[02:40:35.480 --> 02:40:37.480]  Somebody in the middle.
[02:40:37.480 --> 02:40:43.480]  I don't see how anyone could listen and know that all of this training was from these left-leaning experts
[02:40:43.480 --> 02:40:50.480]  and think that that is fair. They themselves, bias training is completely 100% biased.
[02:40:50.480 --> 02:40:52.480]  This is an agenda though.
[02:40:52.480 --> 02:40:54.480]  Remember, they're not well-meaning at the top.
[02:40:54.480 --> 02:40:55.480]  Low level they are.
[02:40:55.480 --> 02:41:00.480]  This is about the new religion is being obsessed about what color you are, where you're from,
[02:41:00.480 --> 02:41:03.480]  or what you look like versus the character of what you do.
[02:41:03.480 --> 02:41:06.480]  It's a 180 for Martin Luther King.
[02:41:06.480 --> 02:41:07.480]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:41:07.480 --> 02:41:09.480]  I really appreciate you having the courage to come on.
[02:41:09.480 --> 02:41:10.480]  Thank you for having me.
[02:41:10.480 --> 02:41:12.480]  Keep fighting that fight.
[02:41:12.480 --> 02:41:13.480]  Well, thank you so much.
[02:41:13.480 --> 02:41:14.480]  We'll get her back on.
[02:41:14.480 --> 02:41:16.480]  Now, Laura Loomer is coming up.
[02:41:16.480 --> 02:41:19.480]  When I say bombshell, I mean bombshell.
[02:41:19.480 --> 02:41:21.480]  New Vegas shooting documents for real.
[02:41:21.480 --> 02:41:24.480]  Three women found in Stephen Paddock's room.
[02:41:24.480 --> 02:41:25.480]  Something we'd first reported.
[02:41:25.480 --> 02:41:26.480]  Something they tried to deny.
[02:41:26.480 --> 02:41:28.480]  Laura Loomer is on fire.
[02:41:28.480 --> 02:41:29.480]  She's coming up.
[02:41:29.480 --> 02:41:31.480]  Now, you know we're under massive attack.
[02:41:31.480 --> 02:41:35.480]  You know the globalists are trying to shut us down right now.
[02:41:35.480 --> 02:41:40.480]  And that's why I want to encourage listeners to experience the amazing supplements for yourselves
[02:41:40.480 --> 02:41:46.480]  and support the broadcast, whether it's DNA force or X2 or grain force
[02:41:46.480 --> 02:41:48.480]  or the real red pill plus now with energy or silver bullet,
[02:41:48.480 --> 02:41:49.480]  little silver or alpha power.
[02:41:49.480 --> 02:41:50.480]  You got to try that.
[02:41:50.480 --> 02:41:53.480]  Or supermails for film of a tally, the cold pressed herbs,
[02:41:53.480 --> 02:41:54.480]  nothing like that.
[02:41:54.480 --> 02:41:57.480]  Flora life or amazing probiotic.
[02:41:57.480 --> 02:41:59.480]  High quality, swarable food, one year, six months,
[02:41:59.480 --> 02:42:02.480]  three month supplies, 50% off everything I just mentioned,

[02:42:04.480 --> 02:42:06.480]  That is a big deal on all of it,
[02:42:06.480 --> 02:42:09.480]  an even bigger deal on the food.
[02:42:09.480 --> 02:42:12.480]  And when you support us and get great products at the same time,
[02:42:12.480 --> 02:42:14.480]  it's a win-win and it changes the world
[02:42:14.480 --> 02:42:16.480]  and they're so angry they can't shut us down.
[02:42:16.480 --> 02:42:18.480]  They're so angry people don't listen to them when they lie about us
[02:42:18.480 --> 02:42:22.480]  or edit tapes or making Kelly edits tapes to me on NBC and Fox.
[02:42:22.480 --> 02:42:23.480]  They don't know what to do.
[02:42:23.480 --> 02:42:24.480]  They're behind.
[02:42:24.480 --> 02:42:26.480]  They're just totally beside themselves.
[02:42:26.480 --> 02:42:29.480]  They will have such a big win if they're able to shut us down.
[02:42:29.480 --> 02:42:31.480]  Well, I'm not looking for them to shut us down.
[02:42:31.480 --> 02:42:33.480]  We're going to expand.
[02:42:33.480 --> 02:42:34.480]  We're going to branch off.
[02:42:34.480 --> 02:42:38.480]  We are going to do so much, especially with these unprecedented attacks.
[02:42:38.480 --> 02:42:41.480]  It has just given us the impetus and the energy and the initiative
[02:42:41.480 --> 02:42:43.480]  to go to the next level.
[02:42:43.480 --> 02:42:44.480]  So we are launched.
[02:42:44.480 --> 02:42:45.480]  We are go.
[02:42:45.480 --> 02:42:47.480]  Blast off Info Wars the next level
[02:42:47.480 --> 02:42:50.480]  and all the prosperity and success that comes with us.

[02:43:54.480 --> 02:43:58.480]  Texas Governor Greg Abbott revealed a new plan Wednesday
[02:43:58.480 --> 02:44:01.480]  to reduce the danger of shootings in the state's schools.
[02:44:01.480 --> 02:44:05.480]  The School and Firearms Safety Action Plan makes dozens of recommendations
[02:44:05.480 --> 02:44:08.480]  concerning school security as well as mental health.
[02:44:08.480 --> 02:44:12.480]  Specific proposals include increasing the number of law enforcement officers
[02:44:12.480 --> 02:44:17.480]  on school grounds as well as mental health evaluations for at-risk students.
[02:44:17.480 --> 02:44:21.480]  The plan also calls for increased active shooter and emergency response training
[02:44:21.480 --> 02:44:23.480]  for local communities.
[02:44:23.480 --> 02:44:26.480]  And several pieces of legislation are up for debate.
[02:44:26.480 --> 02:44:29.480]  One such law would allow families, school administrators, or police
[02:44:29.480 --> 02:44:32.480]  to petition that a potentially dangerous individual
[02:44:32.480 --> 02:44:35.480]  be kept from owning firearms after legal due process
[02:44:35.480 --> 02:44:38.480]  while another would require that proper authorities be alerted
[02:44:38.480 --> 02:44:43.480]  within 48 hours of any change to a person's legal ability to own a gun.
[02:44:43.480 --> 02:44:46.480]  Abbott says his plan provides strategies that can be used
[02:44:46.480 --> 02:44:49.480]  before the next school year begins to keep students safe
[02:44:49.480 --> 02:44:51.480]  when they return to school.
[02:44:51.480 --> 02:45:01.480]  Leanne McAdoo, InfoWars.com.
[02:45:21.480 --> 02:45:23.480]  Another saying, go beyond censorship,
[02:45:23.480 --> 02:45:26.480]  brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[02:45:26.480 --> 02:45:29.480]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies
[02:45:29.480 --> 02:45:31.480]  so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[02:45:31.480 --> 02:45:34.480]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[02:45:34.480 --> 02:45:37.480]  It is so critical that you go to InfoWars.com
[02:45:37.480 --> 02:45:40.480]  or slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter
[02:45:40.480 --> 02:45:42.480]  so we can be in contact with you
[02:45:42.480 --> 02:45:44.480]  and so the censors can bully their way in
[02:45:44.480 --> 02:45:49.480]  and block us being able to engage in free, open dialogue as a society.
[02:45:49.480 --> 02:45:51.480]  That is critical to this fight.
[02:45:51.480 --> 02:46:20.480]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[02:46:21.480 --> 02:46:23.480]  Thank you so much for watching this video.
[02:46:23.480 --> 02:46:25.480]  If you have any questions or questions,
[02:46:25.480 --> 02:46:28.480]  please feel free to post them in the comments below.
[02:46:28.480 --> 02:46:54.480]  Thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[02:46:58.480 --> 02:47:06.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:06.480 --> 02:47:33.480]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report.
[02:47:33.480 --> 02:47:38.480]  Thanks for joining us.
[02:47:38.480 --> 02:47:41.480]  Laura Lumer is an amazing investigative journalist.
[02:47:41.480 --> 02:47:44.480]  She also gets in there and asks the hard questions.
[02:47:44.480 --> 02:47:49.480]  She has been off and on spending a lot of time in Las Vegas
[02:47:49.480 --> 02:47:53.480]  burrowing in and so much of what broke there came from her
[02:47:53.480 --> 02:47:55.480]  and was corroborated by her.
[02:47:55.480 --> 02:47:58.480]  I think it's best to just let her get into it right away.
[02:47:58.480 --> 02:48:00.480]  But remember Vegas?
[02:48:00.480 --> 02:48:03.480]  It was a gun massacre in U.S. history but suddenly it disappeared off the radar
[02:48:03.480 --> 02:48:05.480]  because it had Islamic connections.
[02:48:05.480 --> 02:48:08.480]  We broke that first from the hostage rescue team sources
[02:48:08.480 --> 02:48:11.480]  and then Laura went there and backed it up and many others backed it up as well.
[02:48:11.480 --> 02:48:14.480]  And now they just hope you forget about it.
[02:48:14.480 --> 02:48:16.480]  Laura Lumer, thanks for joining us.
[02:48:16.480 --> 02:48:18.480]  Thanks for having me, Alex.
[02:48:18.480 --> 02:48:20.480]  Well, lay this out.
[02:48:20.480 --> 02:48:23.480]  You wrote it for Dangerous.com where it first appeared.
[02:48:23.480 --> 02:48:25.480]  It's also an InfoWars.com.
[02:48:25.480 --> 02:48:27.480]  You were kind enough to let us post it.
[02:48:27.480 --> 02:48:32.480]  You know, the great Milo Yiannopoulos, but roll through this amazing information.
[02:48:32.480 --> 02:48:36.480]  Right. It's also on my website, lauralumer.us, if you want to read it.
[02:48:36.480 --> 02:48:41.480]  But basically about a week and a half ago or so, there was a document dump.
[02:48:41.480 --> 02:48:45.480]  The court in Las Vegas, the judge in Vegas ordered the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department
[02:48:45.480 --> 02:48:48.480]  to release documents and evidence pertaining to the Las Vegas shooting
[02:48:48.480 --> 02:48:53.480]  that Sheriff Lombardo and the LVMPD has been fighting to not release to the American public.
[02:48:53.480 --> 02:48:56.480]  Well, turns out, you know, I've been going through the 2000 pages
[02:48:56.480 --> 02:48:59.480]  and you have to manually read them because they made it
[02:48:59.480 --> 02:49:01.480]  so that you can't do optimal keyword searches on them.
[02:49:01.480 --> 02:49:05.480]  They kind of distorted the background of the documents with this granular background.
[02:49:05.480 --> 02:49:11.480]  And I've been finding these insane, shocking witness statements, police statements,
[02:49:11.480 --> 02:49:15.480]  and things that they should have told us in the immediate aftermath of the Las Vegas shooting
[02:49:15.480 --> 02:49:17.480]  that has been kept secret, right?
[02:49:17.480 --> 02:49:21.480]  Or would just withheld from the public to cover up the true motive behind the Vegas shooting,
[02:49:21.480 --> 02:49:25.480]  which is starting to look like terrorism more and more every single day.
[02:49:25.480 --> 02:49:30.480]  A few days ago, I released a story about how one of the documents in the dispatch logs,
[02:49:30.480 --> 02:49:33.480]  this is an official Las Vegas police officer document.
[02:49:33.480 --> 02:49:39.480]  It says that when they entered the room, it said that the unit was under control room 32135
[02:49:39.480 --> 02:49:42.480]  where Stephen Paddock was supposedly shooting.
[02:49:42.480 --> 02:49:46.480]  And it says that there were three women in the room and you can zoom in on the document.
[02:49:46.480 --> 02:49:51.480]  This isn't speculation. This isn't conspiracy. This isn't some wild accusation.
[02:49:51.480 --> 02:49:57.480]  You can look and see for yourself the copy, the screenshot of the document that came out of
[02:49:57.480 --> 02:49:59.480]  the dispatch logs from LVMPD.
[02:49:59.480 --> 02:50:03.480]  And you can see that they're still trying to obscure the important information.
[02:50:03.480 --> 02:50:05.480]  They have removed the identities of the women.
[02:50:05.480 --> 02:50:09.480]  And you can see that it says three women right there for your own eyes, right?
[02:50:09.480 --> 02:50:13.480]  And then it refers to these women as number one, number two, and under number three,
[02:50:13.480 --> 02:50:17.480]  if you go back to the document, they have redacted the names of the three women.
[02:50:17.480 --> 02:50:22.480]  So obviously, Sheriff Lombardo, just like I said when I was doing exclusive reports for Info Wars
[02:50:22.480 --> 02:50:27.480]  back in October, Sheriff Lombardo and the FBI in Las Vegas under Agent Rouse,
[02:50:27.480 --> 02:50:32.480]  they lied to the American people. They lied to the world about Stephen Paddock being alone in that room
[02:50:32.480 --> 02:50:36.480]  the night of October 1st. And they also lied about others.
[02:50:36.480 --> 02:50:39.480]  Let me stop you right there. I should have been more sensational because I always just come in
[02:50:39.480 --> 02:50:43.480]  and we announce huge information like it's no big deal or like the weather report.
[02:50:43.480 --> 02:50:48.480]  Exactly. In fact, we should go back and get those press conferences where they lied, lied, lied, lied,
[02:50:48.480 --> 02:50:55.480]  and we now know lied and contradicted themselves over and over again because that's what we're talking about here.
[02:50:55.480 --> 02:51:01.480]  Well, not only that, but if you recall, I believe I was on with Owen Schreuer the week that the shooting happened.
[02:51:01.480 --> 02:51:05.480]  Sheriff Lombardo banned me. He had me physically removed from the Las Vegas press conference.
[02:51:05.480 --> 02:51:08.480]  And then when I returned the next day to cover the next press conference,
[02:51:08.480 --> 02:51:13.480]  he had armed security preventing me from going inside because I exposed him as a liar for the liar.
[02:51:13.480 --> 02:51:18.480]  He really is on live TV and he was forced to then change the official timeline.
[02:51:18.480 --> 02:51:20.480]  You know, it's also very concerning about these documents.
[02:51:20.480 --> 02:51:23.480]  If you look at that same screenshot you just had up on the screen right there,
[02:51:23.480 --> 02:51:28.480]  you'll see that the official date is September 25th and with a checkout date of October 2nd.
[02:51:28.480 --> 02:51:34.480]  So if we recall, the whole point of me going to the Vegas press conference was because I exclusively
[02:51:34.480 --> 02:51:40.480]  obtained room service receipts from sources inside Mandalay Bay that showed that Steven Paddock checked in on the 25th,
[02:51:40.480 --> 02:51:47.480]  not the 28th of September like Lombardo and the FBI originally told the public the first in the first press conference
[02:51:47.480 --> 02:51:49.480]  they had the first day of the shooting.
[02:51:49.480 --> 02:51:54.480]  So the documents not only show that Lombardo is a liar, but it vindicates me in my reporting.
[02:51:54.480 --> 02:51:57.480]  And all of these outlets called me a conspiracy theorist.
[02:51:57.480 --> 02:52:02.480]  They said the Info Wars was a conspiracy theorist site simply because I had the balls and no other journalists
[02:52:02.480 --> 02:52:05.480]  did to confront Lombardo on live TV, right?
[02:52:05.480 --> 02:52:06.480]  And I exposed him.
[02:52:06.480 --> 02:52:10.480]  And now he's running for reelection and he has an election coming up on the 12th.
[02:52:10.480 --> 02:52:11.480]  And who knows?
[02:52:11.480 --> 02:52:15.480]  Maybe he won't win because now people are starting to realize that Laura Loomer was right.
[02:52:15.480 --> 02:52:16.480]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:52:16.480 --> 02:52:23.480]  All these people were right about Sheriff Lombardo being a corrupt lying operative in Vegas.
[02:52:23.480 --> 02:52:26.480]  And again, I'm glad you've launched a website.
[02:52:26.480 --> 02:52:28.480]  I know you're really big on Twitter in places.
[02:52:28.480 --> 02:52:32.480]  But let's go through where people can find your investigative journalism.
[02:52:32.480 --> 02:52:34.480]  We'll post your stories at infowars.com periodically.
[02:52:34.480 --> 02:52:37.480]  But what is your website against when we put that on screen for folks?
[02:52:37.480 --> 02:52:44.480]  My website is lauraluomer.us and it's going to include some more features in the next week or two.
[02:52:44.480 --> 02:52:49.480]  I'm updating my website as we speak, but you can go to my website and you can see my articles.
[02:52:49.480 --> 02:52:54.480]  I break a lot of stories and Milo also covers my reporting on his website dangerous.com.
[02:52:54.480 --> 02:52:58.480]  And today the story was so sensational.
[02:52:58.480 --> 02:53:06.480]  I broke another story today about how an Uber driver told police that Stephen Paddock told them that there was going to be a terrorist attack at the Mandalay Bay.
[02:53:06.480 --> 02:53:07.480]  And they covered this up.
[02:53:07.480 --> 02:53:11.480]  I mean, you can see this story and the last story, it crashed Milo's website.
[02:53:11.480 --> 02:53:14.480]  We're talking about Milo Yiannopoulos, who has millions of followers.
[02:53:14.480 --> 02:53:19.480]  I mean, he's sensational, one of the most well-known conservative, you know, individuals on this planet.
[02:53:19.480 --> 02:53:23.480]  And his website crashed twice because of the articles I released.
[02:53:23.480 --> 02:53:26.480]  People are dying to find out what happened in Vegas.
[02:53:26.480 --> 02:53:34.480]  People want to know what happened that night that is now the worst mass shooting in U.S. history because the mainstream media has completely swept it under the rug.
[02:53:34.480 --> 02:53:44.480]  And the local media in Vegas is being totally complicit in this full-blown cover-up because they don't want to lose access to their sources within the FBI.
[02:53:44.480 --> 02:53:53.480]  And let's be clear, they demonized them fools, they demonized me, they demonized you, they demonized everybody because we're not controllable and we'll go where the truth is.
[02:53:53.480 --> 02:53:54.480]  No matter where it was.
[02:53:54.480 --> 02:54:02.480]  But let me tell you, I was able to see secret video out of Florida that was brought to me with lawyers and the individuals here and flying them here and everything.
[02:54:02.480 --> 02:54:05.480]  And I was shown video.
[02:54:05.480 --> 02:54:09.480]  And I cannot say what the video is.
[02:54:09.480 --> 02:54:17.480]  People just say that it was Paddock's brother and it was all the things he said that dialed into everything we knew.
[02:54:17.480 --> 02:54:24.480]  And I can't tell you because then they decided that I couldn't use it or, you know, I didn't have the money to pay for it, whatever.
[02:54:24.480 --> 02:54:38.480]  I'm just saying we know a lot more that people don't know, but it's come out from our sources in the FBI and then Zach and the Army that we had the two different Islamic groups there
[02:54:38.480 --> 02:54:41.480]  fighting inside Saudi Arabia.
[02:54:41.480 --> 02:54:43.480]  There was a civil war going on then.
[02:54:43.480 --> 02:54:53.480]  The Trump-supported side has come out on top that they were having a big convention with tens of thousands of people there and that they used going in to meet with Paddock in a gun deal, which he was a gun dealer.
[02:54:53.480 --> 02:55:01.480]  He'd done gun deals in the Middle East, probably fast and furious, to kill him and then do this terror attack of some type of message to Trump.
[02:55:01.480 --> 02:55:12.480]  But because the hostage rescue team and you and many others' exposure was really happening, they had to drop it as an anti-gun deal because it got exposed as Islamic and that's the third rail of the Liberals to cover up Islamic terror.
[02:55:12.480 --> 02:55:15.480]  From your research, Laura, how accurate is that statement?
[02:55:15.480 --> 02:55:25.480]  Well, look, there's a lot of information pertaining to this idea of the Saudis, but really my focus is on ISIS and I can't reveal who my sources are, obviously, but I'm in touch with people.
[02:55:25.480 --> 02:55:31.480]  Well, sure, what about ISIS groups from out of Saudi Arabia using the big Saudi meeting as the cover to get there?
[02:55:31.480 --> 02:55:34.480]  Well, my focus really isn't so much on that, Alex.
[02:55:34.480 --> 02:55:47.480]  My focus really is on the fact that ISIS warned that they were going to attack Las Vegas and not only did they attack Las Vegas, but this is now being covered up and ISIS continued to claim responsibility.
[02:55:47.480 --> 02:55:58.480]  And if you read my story that came out today that's at the top of my Twitter feed, you will see how and why the FBI is trying to cover up the fact that this was most likely an act of what's looking like Islamic terror.
[02:55:58.480 --> 02:56:07.480]  Okay, so this one article we're covering from a few days ago confirming they lied about all the women inside his condo, inside the apartment, inside the hotel, and then more coming out.
[02:56:07.480 --> 02:56:10.480]  We'll go to your Twitter feed and pull up the latest article.
[02:56:10.480 --> 02:56:13.480]  Give us the headline on that and then go over it.
[02:56:13.480 --> 02:56:14.480]  Right.
[02:56:14.480 --> 02:56:31.480]  So in the last article, the one that you were just referring to actually another piece of information that I had released was that the night of the shooting, there was a detective on dispatch in the dispatch LVMPV logs that said that Mary Lou Danley had a follower on Facebook who was tied to her daughter,
[02:56:31.480 --> 02:56:36.480]  who was posting Islamic State propaganda and videos of ISIS beheadings in Arabic.
[02:56:36.480 --> 02:56:45.480]  Right. And as you know, I and a few others along with Shepard and Bellas of Intel, we were the first to report that Mary Lou Danley deleted her Facebook page the night of the Las Vegas shooting.
[02:56:45.480 --> 02:56:55.480]  But the mainstream media, because they just want to ignore the truth, they reported the same information in January when police documents that were released by court order came out and showed it.
[02:56:55.480 --> 02:57:10.480]  So people would be wise to just listen to the people like me and you and the independent media because we're months ahead of the news. And, you know, this is this is a huge lead because, you know, when you read my article today, the Uber driver said that when she picks
[02:57:10.480 --> 02:57:17.480]  Stephen Paddock up in the Uber and dropped him off at Mandalay Bay, he was with a woman who could possibly be Mary Lou Danley.
[02:57:17.480 --> 02:57:22.480]  And they were talking about how there was going to be a terrorist attack at Mandalay Bay.
[02:57:22.480 --> 02:57:31.480]  This is huge. You've got other witnesses on record saying get out of here. You'll all be dead in 45 minutes that had had had darker skin.
[02:57:31.480 --> 02:57:38.480]  Women, they said Hispanic, but it looks like it was these Filipino women, which we know have been used consistently for cutouts out of those groups.
[02:57:38.480 --> 02:57:45.480]  And then you've got this confirmed and you've got other witnesses saying it. And now they're telling folks in Uber cars.
[02:57:45.480 --> 02:57:51.480]  Patrick in the great nation of Australia. You're on the air worldwide. Thanks for holding.
[02:57:51.480 --> 02:57:55.480]  I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now.
[02:57:55.480 --> 02:58:03.480]  I remember back when info wars and prison planet, it was just blue text on a white screen and I had to load down the page on my dial up into that.
[02:58:03.480 --> 02:58:08.480]  And I thought it was pretty cool and read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests.
[02:58:08.480 --> 02:58:12.480]  And I've been using your product since the first iteration of survival shield.
[02:58:12.480 --> 02:58:19.480]  And since then I'm on the X2, the super male vitality, the caveman, the real red pill, micro ZX body.
[02:58:19.480 --> 02:58:21.480]  It's all amazing. Thank you brother.
[02:58:21.480 --> 02:58:29.480]  Yeah. And I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[02:58:29.480 --> 02:58:34.480]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[02:58:34.480 --> 02:58:41.480]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew and the listeners out there, 1776 worldwide.
[02:58:41.480 --> 02:58:52.480]  President Trump gave a speech on Friday at the Naval Academy for their commencement and said America is back.
[02:58:52.480 --> 02:59:02.480]  Hollywood does not have the megaphone anymore, but patriots that believe in real Americana are back in charge and the world is taking notice.
[02:59:02.480 --> 02:59:16.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, to celebrate Memorial Day and the great sacrifices of our veterans, we are offering free shipping and infowarstore.com and 50% off on more than 20 bestselling items like Brain Force, The Amazing Neutropic.
[02:59:16.480 --> 02:59:28.480]  Help support the information war, get great products at the same time and continue to fund an operation that is a thorn on the side of the globalist and is continuing to back President Trump and other patriots, not just here but worldwide,
[02:59:28.480 --> 02:59:35.480]  in support of free market capitalism, support of Christianity, support of family, support of basic freedom.
[02:59:35.480 --> 02:59:41.480]  Huge Memorial Day specials, running throughout this weekend until the month of May ends.
[02:59:41.480 --> 03:00:05.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:05.480 --> 03:00:26.480]  This is our land. These are our people. The workers, the strikers, the builders. These are our people. Who are they?
[03:00:26.480 --> 03:00:35.480]  They are the dark armies. The dark murdering armies whose only honor is atrocities.
[03:00:35.480 --> 03:00:52.480]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:52.480 --> 03:00:57.480]  I want to thank the great crew we got in here running this operation where I'm in here three, four hours a day.
[03:00:57.480 --> 03:01:03.480]  I want lawyers coming up. Lionel's coming up. Laura Loomer's coming up. And look, infowar isn't made out of money.
[03:01:03.480 --> 03:01:09.480]  They're just like I've underwritten Tommy Robinson with equipment and money and not just ask the listeners to support him.
[03:01:09.480 --> 03:01:12.480]  What you've been doing, I want to thank you because he's doing some historic stuff.
[03:01:12.480 --> 03:01:16.480]  I've asked folks to support us. We've supported Laura Loomer on some of her missions.
[03:01:16.480 --> 03:01:29.480]  We're talking, you know, substantive donations. I'm about to make another to Laura so that she can intrepidly, she always, it's paid her, go out and cover this election with a sheriff and the cover up.
[03:01:29.480 --> 03:01:36.480]  Very, very dangerous work. A lot of people have been killed in surrounding this. I picked my battles. I tell you, I have not gone to Vegas because it's so dangerous.
[03:01:36.480 --> 03:01:42.480]  It's not that I'm scared of it. I've just got a lot of big fish to fry. This is one of the biggest.
[03:01:42.480 --> 03:01:47.480]  It's just that we don't need to go because Laura Loomer's going. So be sure and pray for her.
[03:01:47.480 --> 03:01:59.480]  And Laura, you've also got a PayPal account. More and more conservative libertarian nationalist folks are at the behest of listeners, not George Soros, but of their fans of what they're doing who are backing you.
[03:01:59.480 --> 03:02:01.480]  So how do folks donate to you?
[03:02:01.480 --> 03:02:13.480]  You can go to PayPal.me slash Laura Loomer. I'm also on Patreon, but the best way to contribute is really through PayPal. And like you just said, I do plan on going back out to Vegas if I can secure the funding to do so.
[03:02:13.480 --> 03:02:22.480]  Because there is an election coming up on June 12th and Sheriff Lombardo needs to be exposed. And regardless of whether he wins or not, he needs to be held accountable and he needs to be questioned.
[03:02:22.480 --> 03:02:33.480]  And the FBI in Las Vegas needs to be questioned. And people really need to start talking about this information in Las Vegas because we're talking about the worst mass shooting in US history, possibly a terrorist attack.
[03:02:33.480 --> 03:02:38.480]  It looks like a terrorist attack. And I don't know why, but nobody wants to talk about it.
[03:02:38.480 --> 03:02:53.480]  Really, ISIS never takes credit for things they haven't done. And they've taken credit for this. They said before they were going to do it, they did it after. It's exactly what they said they'd do. It looks like they used somebody that was running them guns as a setup to get the weapons.
[03:02:53.480 --> 03:03:03.480]  It was a message to Trump as well. And how vindicated are we that they won't say what happened and are covering it up? That right there is sensational, but notice it's just out of the news.
[03:03:03.480 --> 03:03:13.480]  It's on info wars. It's on your site. It's on lowerlumer.us. It's on dangerous.com. But that's pretty much it.
[03:03:13.480 --> 03:03:19.480]  Yeah, you're right. And even though I've been sending these reports to the mainstream media, a lot of them are just kind of ignoring the information.
[03:03:19.480 --> 03:03:26.480]  So right now the mainstream media is being complicit with this cover up of the Las Vegas shooting. And it's no longer, it's not a conspiracy to say it's a cover up.
[03:03:26.480 --> 03:03:39.480]  When you have a sheriff who knows the night of the shooting that Steven Paddock checked in on the 25th and there were three women in his room. And he intentionally tells the media and the public the very next day that Steven Paddock was alone and that he checked in three days later than the actual check-in date.
[03:03:39.480 --> 03:03:41.480]  That is not a conspiracy.
[03:03:41.480 --> 03:03:53.480]  We talked a bunch of other lies. Let me ask you this. Why do you think these women were running around 45 s before saying get out of here. You're all going to be dead. And they match the descriptions of the women in the hotel.
[03:03:53.480 --> 03:04:05.480]  Well, that's another thing that needs to be answered. And these these statements were also mentioned in the official documents and dispatch logs that were put out by LVMPD recently. And these are questions that the media should be asking.
[03:04:05.480 --> 03:04:13.480]  What I want to know is how come the names of these witnesses have been redacted. Why is it that they're making it so that people can't reach out to them and ask them to do their own independent investigations.
[03:04:13.480 --> 03:04:23.480]  It's like they want the victims names to go away. They want the witnesses to go away. They just want everyone to forget about this. And it is so sinister. And obviously Lombardo doesn't want to talk about it.
[03:04:23.480 --> 03:04:33.480]  I mean yesterday he issued a comment ban to prevent people from talking about this. LVMPD cannot talk about it under Sheriff Lombardo. They are literally banned.
[03:04:33.480 --> 03:04:45.480]  Laura Lemma, amazing job. When we come back, I want to briefly ask you what else you've got in the fire, the other irons you've got in the fire. We were planning to confront you, name it. And then Lionel is going to be taking over.
[03:04:45.480 --> 03:04:53.480]  He's a middle of the road guy, but he likes Trump. And he's been pointing out that there's a lot of crazy judicial stuff going on, but the latest.

[03:06:12.480 --> 03:06:28.480]  You know, she doesn't want anything, but Daria, our lead producer, just does the work of three or four people. She's so awesome. And she jumped on getting Michael Rotondo here like a day after the court ruling, because I really wanted to help the guy.
[03:06:28.480 --> 03:06:35.480]  And I wanted to dress him down, you know, but I dress myself down routinely.
[03:06:35.480 --> 03:06:42.480]  I do things that are wrong, but I'm like, look, we got to pay for people's sex changes in this country by the millions and pay for abortions here in Austin.
[03:06:42.480 --> 03:06:48.480]  I don't want to hear he's the worst guy in the world living with his parents when he's 30.
[03:06:48.480 --> 03:06:54.480]  Yeah, he's sucking off of him. It's wrong. I want to find out if this guy is basically autistic.
[03:06:54.480 --> 03:07:06.480]  I mean, a little quirky. Maybe the term is, they used to call it autistic, what they call it an old British term, but a lot of the aristocracy has.
[03:07:06.480 --> 03:07:13.480]  It'll pop in my head in a minute. The point is, is that USA Today, big headline, something positive.
[03:07:13.480 --> 03:07:19.480]  30 year old man finally moves out of his parents' house. Thanks to Alex Jones.
[03:07:19.480 --> 03:07:27.480]  And that's good because nobody else would even give him a dime or they'd offer him a job at a local pizza place or whatever, which is great.
[03:07:27.480 --> 03:07:31.480]  But you need that seed money to get out.
[03:07:31.480 --> 03:07:35.480]  I remember I was working a job, didn't have much money in the bank, didn't really have any credit.
[03:07:35.480 --> 03:07:42.480]  Had a credit card I'd paid off a few times. I was 18 when I said, I'm going to get in your first month.
[03:07:42.480 --> 03:07:49.480]  And I'll pay your second, but your butt is out of the house when I was 18. And he went and found apartments that you like these.
[03:07:49.480 --> 03:07:54.480]  I said, yeah, I want to live in North Austin. You're in South Austin. Boom. I was moved out. And it was awesome.
[03:07:54.480 --> 03:07:58.480]  And my mom didn't have to see me bringing my girlfriends in the house anymore. I was driving her crazy.
[03:07:58.480 --> 03:08:06.480]  And so that's history. And so with the 3000 we gave him, I'm talking about him doing some reporting for us.
[03:08:06.480 --> 03:08:13.480]  So there it is, the 30 year old man finally moves out his parents house. Thanks to Alex Jones. Thanks to all of you supporting us folks.
[03:08:13.480 --> 03:08:22.480]  But because I wanted to show a story of actually giving somebody not a handout, they live in government housing, but the money to get out of the nest, at least.
[03:08:22.480 --> 03:08:31.480]  And we'll see how he does. We'll monitor Mr. Rotondo. We'll probably try to get him back on the show tomorrow, but he has now moved out.
[03:08:31.480 --> 03:08:40.480]  And he's now moving in to his apartment. Still has a little bit of stuff to get out of his parents house.
[03:08:40.480 --> 03:08:45.480]  Now a little meat thing. He said, as for his parents, Rotondo claims he'll never talk to them again.
[03:08:45.480 --> 03:08:51.480]  Well, that's kind of a punk statement. I'm sure they were sick of you, but that's the type of fun stuff we can do.
[03:08:51.480 --> 03:09:03.480]  Shifting gears back to Laura Loomer, investigative journalist, Park Salant. What else is on your radar screen right now? What else are you shining spotlights on?
[03:09:03.480 --> 03:09:11.480]  Well, you can stay tuned because one of the biggest deep state swamp monsters is probably going to be getting loomered in the next week.
[03:09:11.480 --> 03:09:17.480]  So, you know, I've been really busy. I work like 20 hour workdays. You know, I don't really sleep. That's why I always look really tired.
[03:09:17.480 --> 03:09:24.480]  But I don't sleep because I have so much work to do and so much to investigate and so much to do because the mainstream media doesn't do their job.
[03:09:24.480 --> 03:09:27.480]  And they're sure as hell not confronting people who need to be held accountable.
[03:09:27.480 --> 03:09:35.480]  So, you know, not only do I have to do all the investigations by myself and the writings by myself and everything else on my own, but you know, I have to like track down people.
[03:09:35.480 --> 03:09:42.480]  And I have to do these kind of intel operations to find out where certain people are going to be so I can locate them and ambush them.
[03:09:42.480 --> 03:09:49.480]  And it takes a lot of work. So... And why is it that there's only a few libertarian conservative women like you that are these powerhouses?
[03:09:49.480 --> 03:09:59.480]  The feminists and the fake left wish they had women like you. And then the conservatives are like, oh, Laura Loomer, big deal, breaks a bunch of big stories, you know, so what?
[03:09:59.480 --> 03:10:05.480]  I don't know. I mean, I think that they just... I really don't know. I don't have the answer for you.
[03:10:05.480 --> 03:10:09.480]  But, you know, the conservative women, they would have a lot more people if they would actually be willing to pay.
[03:10:09.480 --> 03:10:13.480]  I find that the left has a lot more money behind them than conservatives do.
[03:10:13.480 --> 03:10:17.480]  You have all these George Soros type individuals who bankroll, you know, activists.
[03:10:17.480 --> 03:10:22.480]  They bankroll journalists and independent media on the left is actually well financed, but on the right, it's not.
[03:10:22.480 --> 03:10:26.480]  So, I would really encourage people to support independence.
[03:10:26.480 --> 03:10:33.480]  I mean, if there are wealthy people who are watching Infowars and wealthy conservatives who just kind of want to remain low-key,
[03:10:33.480 --> 03:10:40.480]  you can support the independent media and really give a voice to some of the amazing independent journalists out there like myself.
[03:10:40.480 --> 03:10:44.480]  I mean, you have so many great people working for you. Just imagine if we can get the funding.
[03:10:44.480 --> 03:10:50.480]  Well, that's why they want to destroy us, because they see us as a nexus point, an example of how others could build things.
[03:10:50.480 --> 03:10:58.480]  But that's exactly right. There are studies out where Democrats in Congress have 75 to 80% of the wealth.
[03:10:58.480 --> 03:11:03.480]  Now, money's not bad, but they get it all through insider deals.
[03:11:03.480 --> 03:11:08.480]  Nancy Pelosi's husband got $3 billion in a government contract for biotech through a bill she passed.
[03:11:08.480 --> 03:11:18.480]  I mean, you know, this is crazy. You've got Maxine Waters' husband being bailed out by her repeatedly, tens of millions of dollars.
[03:11:18.480 --> 03:11:23.480]  And this is confirmed to his bank taxpayer money from her.
[03:11:23.480 --> 03:11:29.480]  So that's exactly it. The Democrats are the rich. They're just the ultra cold-blooded rich.
[03:11:29.480 --> 03:11:32.480]  Ten to one. I mean, how many billionaires are conservative?
[03:11:32.480 --> 03:11:39.480]  You might be able to Peter Thiele's more of a libertarian, but I mean, you've got, you know, you've got Donald Trump,
[03:11:39.480 --> 03:11:43.480]  Gary Haven's a low-level billionaire, but he's still got over a billion dollars in assets.
[03:11:43.480 --> 03:11:48.480]  You know, he funds a lot of campaigns and stuff. I mean, who is there? Who is there?
[03:11:48.480 --> 03:11:52.480]  Well, look, there's a lot of these closet Trumps supporting and conservative celebrities.
[03:11:52.480 --> 03:11:57.480]  I mean, look at Kanye West, for example. You have Kim Kardashian visiting with President Trump yesterday.
[03:11:57.480 --> 03:12:03.480]  I mean, these people don't need to make it public like who they're supporting, right?
[03:12:03.480 --> 03:12:09.480]  I mean, there are ways that they could support us and keep it secret, and there's a lot of secret conservatives out there.
[03:12:09.480 --> 03:12:15.480]  And it's not like I'm advocating for lack of transparency, but that's just how our finance system works in the U.S.,
[03:12:15.480 --> 03:12:17.480]  especially when you contribute to politicians.
[03:12:17.480 --> 03:12:23.480]  So people contribute to politicians without disclosing their donors. Why can't they do it for journalists and other people?
[03:12:23.480 --> 03:12:29.480]  Just because they're scared, right? They're scared of all of the backlash they're going to get from other celebrities.
[03:12:29.480 --> 03:12:32.480]  Yeah, they're trying to protect what they've got.
[03:12:32.480 --> 03:12:37.480]  I plan it totally safe, but in the end game, playing it safe in this phase is where you're not playing it safe.
[03:12:37.480 --> 03:12:44.480]  Now it's time to be all in. I mean, I know some of these billionaires that fund some of these fake conservatives have actually tried to reach out to me.
[03:12:44.480 --> 03:12:49.480]  And I've had famous film producers come here, a couple of them, and try to hint they want to work with me.
[03:12:49.480 --> 03:12:52.480]  And I'm so busy, I'm like, you know, I'm just kind of out the door.
[03:12:52.480 --> 03:12:56.480]  But I'm kind of getting the point of what they fear that I am starting.
[03:12:56.480 --> 03:13:00.480]  I mean, Gary Haven was walking out of here yesterday to came visit.
[03:13:00.480 --> 03:13:03.480]  And I said, you know what? I don't need money yet.
[03:13:03.480 --> 03:13:08.480]  But I said, if they start to get me down, he goes, I know, I'll back you at that point. He totally gets it.
[03:13:08.480 --> 03:13:13.480]  And I've got other people. So I don't want to get into my aces and the holes, but I got quite a few of them.
[03:13:13.480 --> 03:13:20.480]  But listeners, I don't want to go to that level. I want to beat them with selling products, selling t-shirts, you know, infowarstore.com.
[03:13:20.480 --> 03:13:23.480]  That's how we're doing it. And then I'm kind of like a baby Soros.
[03:13:23.480 --> 03:13:30.480]  You know, he was a thousand feet tall on the foot tall, but I have given over a million dollars to key journalists, key groups, key people over the years,
[03:13:30.480 --> 03:13:38.480]  whether it be Veritas, whether it be, you know, Robinson, whether it be the most money to paramilitary groups working with law enforcement.
[03:13:38.480 --> 03:13:44.480]  And the last two years, tracking down pedophiles and giving them off the books, legal funding to actually target these groups.
[03:13:44.480 --> 03:13:49.480]  It's all legal, but that's why they're really after me. They know I'm funding the anti-pedophile operations right now.
[03:13:49.480 --> 03:13:53.480]  Hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars. And I got to do it. I mean, God, lay it on my heart.
[03:13:53.480 --> 03:13:58.480]  And that's why I got the globalist after me right now is because behind the scenes, folks, we're hitting them. We're hitting them hard.
[03:13:58.480 --> 03:14:01.480]  Laura Loomer, great job. We'll talk to you again soon.
[03:14:01.480 --> 03:14:03.480]  Thanks for having me, Alex.
[03:14:03.480 --> 03:14:05.480]  Thank you. You're doing an amazing job.
[03:14:05.480 --> 03:14:10.480]  Seriously, how many men are out there doing what she's doing? How many men are doing it? How many women?
[03:14:10.480 --> 03:14:17.480]  It's quite frankly, I don't want to say shameful, but a lot of people just don't feel like it's their role.
[03:14:17.480 --> 03:14:21.480]  Well, I don't think of it as my role 23 years ago, starting on actual television.
[03:14:21.480 --> 03:14:25.480]  And now I'm the number two enemy of the globalist in media.
[03:14:25.480 --> 03:14:32.480]  I mean, I am the kickin' boy. I am the whatever. And I'm glad to take that on, but I don't fear them.
[03:14:32.480 --> 03:14:36.480]  I fear failure and I'm so mad I get tired. I'm so mad I get angry.
[03:14:36.480 --> 03:14:40.480]  I'm so mad that I get into these mental, not fogs.
[03:14:40.480 --> 03:14:45.480]  I mean, my brain's still working really good, but I just can't power through with everything I want to do.
[03:14:45.480 --> 03:14:48.480]  I'm mad at myself. I'm not doing a good enough job.
[03:14:48.480 --> 03:14:55.480]  But if you will fund us at infowarstore.com, then the, I mean, listen, Candace Owens wanted to work here.
[03:14:55.480 --> 03:14:58.480]  I was still budgeting. Didn't know if I had the money to run her operations.
[03:14:58.480 --> 03:15:00.480]  She went to Turning Point USA, which is great.
[03:15:00.480 --> 03:15:04.480]  I'm glad they're there. That's one of the only other groups out there.
[03:15:04.480 --> 03:15:07.480]  And, you know, I sit there and I haven't hired Lumer.
[03:15:07.480 --> 03:15:12.480]  No, I know she's great because, you know, I'm like, always trying to wait and like, we'll hire more crews and more live shows and more.
[03:15:12.480 --> 03:15:16.480]  And I'm just sitting here. If I had the money, look what we've already done.
[03:15:16.480 --> 03:15:20.480]  I would devastate them. You would be devastating them. We would be devastating them.
[03:15:20.480 --> 03:15:24.480]  So I make it easy, man. We got the best, horrible food for the price out there.
[03:15:24.480 --> 03:15:29.480]  My Patreon supply private labeled 50% off brand new fresh food and free shipping. Nobody does that.
[03:15:29.480 --> 03:15:32.480]  I've got X2. I got brain force 50% off. I got it all there.
[03:15:32.480 --> 03:15:36.480]  Real Red Pill Plus now with energy, DNA force, bodies, it's all there.

[03:15:41.480 --> 03:15:46.480]  And no, you are standing in the way of the globalist and their mission to destroy free speech across this country.
[03:15:46.480 --> 03:15:51.480]  We're so close to winning, but we're in sudden death over time and we need your support.
[03:15:52.480 --> 03:15:54.480]  You have been lied to.
[03:15:54.480 --> 03:15:59.480]  My name is Kevin Ship. I'm a former decorated CIA officer.
[03:15:59.480 --> 03:16:04.480]  Finally, someone has come out and written what I think is the best ex-Mose on the shadow government ever.
[03:16:04.480 --> 03:16:10.480]  We're in a constitutional crisis and our government is now being run and ruled by a shadow government.
[03:16:10.480 --> 03:16:13.480]  We've got to get this out because just because you're awake, folks, doesn't mean other people are.

[03:17:53.480 --> 03:18:00.480]  Kim Kardashian West was at the White House this week apparently to have a meeting with President Trump to discuss prison reform.
[03:18:00.480 --> 03:18:07.480]  The reality TV star has advocated for a pardon of a woman serving a life sentence without parole for a first time drug offense.
[03:18:07.480 --> 03:18:14.480]  CNN's Jim Acosta lamented the Kardashian meeting saying it wasn't a serious thing to have happen at the White House.
[03:18:14.480 --> 03:18:20.480]  It's not clear if Acosta suddenly has a problem with celebrities coming to the White House. It was quite routine during the Obama years.
[03:18:20.480 --> 03:18:28.480]  Rapper Meek Mill has been a long time advocate for prison reform and he was set to speak on a panel as part of President Trump's Prison Reform Summit.
[03:18:28.480 --> 03:18:35.480]  TMZ reported that after a late night call from Jay-Z saying meeting with Trump would be problematic for his image and for the cause.
[03:18:35.480 --> 03:18:41.480]  Meek bailed on that meeting. Meek said he remains fully committed to improving our criminal justice system.
[03:18:41.480 --> 03:18:48.480]  Clearly not enough to put politics aside. Kardashian has made it clear she doesn't share her husband Kanye's support for President Trump,
[03:18:48.480 --> 03:18:51.480]  but at least she was willing to take a meeting for the cause.
[03:18:51.480 --> 03:19:05.480]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[03:19:05.480 --> 03:19:09.480]  That's why I'm introducing ZShield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[03:19:09.480 --> 03:19:17.480]  It's made in the USA. It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the Info War.
[03:19:17.480 --> 03:19:29.480]  It is a classical 360 win. This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[03:19:29.480 --> 03:19:40.480]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this country in the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you,
[03:19:40.480 --> 03:19:48.480]  the remnant of America to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be thanks to your support and your prayers together.
[03:19:48.480 --> 03:20:14.480]  We're changing the world. Now it's time to change our bodies with ZShield InfoWarsLive.com.
[03:20:14.480 --> 03:20:30.480]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:20:30.480 --> 03:20:45.480]  Lionel's taken over but he asked me to stay here in the catbird seat in the studio so that he could talk about this MSNBC host Joy Reed faces new questions about her old blog.
[03:20:45.480 --> 03:21:00.480]  So the fact that she did that says she's evil but Lionel, former prosecutor, syndicated talk show host and bestselling author has an interesting angle on this so Lionel, tell me what it is.
[03:21:00.480 --> 03:21:19.480]  MSNBC, as I call it, has a little bit hard record to explain as far as hiring and keeping reporters of color, women in particular. There's Melissa Perry Harris, there was Tamron Hall, so now we have Joy Reed.
[03:21:19.480 --> 03:21:34.480]  There was Ann Curry, that was the morning show, today's show. But here's the best part. So they had her on this story where she said in a blog years ago, she said xenophobic and homophobic and islamophobic, you name the phobic, she said it.
[03:21:34.480 --> 03:21:53.480]  And using the way back machine, it sounds like Phineas J. Whoopee from the cartoon days, using the way back machine, she apparently had her blog hacked by time bandits because they indicated there as evidence by the Library of Congress and others that she had made these statements in the past.
[03:21:53.480 --> 03:22:09.480]  She said she apologized, let it go. So something tells me, and I'm just guessing, that MSNBC said, you know, we got a problem with her. She's on with Andrea Mitchell, and if you could have seen it today, I hope you saw that piece where Andrea Mitchell, and she
[03:22:09.480 --> 03:22:26.480]  are talking, and Andrea Mitchell says, you know, what do you have to do to get fired? What must you say on social media to get fired around her? And you could see Joy Reed blinking, like Jeremiah Denton during one of those torture videos, like help me, what are you doing, stop it.
[03:22:26.480 --> 03:22:45.480]  So here's the story. So now Alex, they figured, now we've got her. She is a truther. Now, nobody even, they said a truther. A truther, I said, well, let me see what she's truthing about.
[03:22:45.480 --> 03:22:59.480]  Listen to this. And they, of course, mentioned you, as you correctly say. Listen to this off the wall tin foil hat, by the way, it's aluminum foil. We haven't wore tin in years. But listen to this off the wall statements she makes quote.
[03:22:59.480 --> 03:23:20.480]  Many of you have seen these blog posts circulating online and social media. Many of them are home. I'm sorry. Pardon me. I found just one second. I lost my, I cannot believe I do.
[03:23:20.480 --> 03:23:30.480]  Dude, dude, I understand. You're trying to find the quote. Take your time. So they're trying to crucify her, but it's come out that there was a standout on 9 11. It's come out and Saudi Arabia was involved. I mean, so much of what we first said has been confirmed.
[03:23:30.480 --> 03:23:45.480]  So she's bad for linking to an evil, evil, evil loose change show my produced. Thank you. You know what happened? I picked up, I pushed the wrong button, Alex, and I went to the wrong place. Do you know why I print everything? They think it's some prop. I do. I do it because the damn things disappear.
[03:23:45.480 --> 03:24:02.480]  You can't find them online. Okay, I apologize for that. So horrible. Thank you for the Japanese thing. Okay. Here's what she said. The fundamental question is, do you believe the official story of 9 11? This is what she wrote, wrote in her post. If you do great.
[03:24:02.480 --> 03:24:15.480]  If you don't, then everything that happened after that is called into serious question. Even if you're agnostic or you tend to believe that Al Qaeda attacked the World Trade Center and Pentagon and that the government had no warning.
[03:24:15.480 --> 03:24:25.480]  Such a thing could happen. It's worth taking a second look. That is totally reasonable. So they're trying to fire people for saying you have a right to investigate.
[03:24:25.480 --> 03:24:39.480]  Oh, wait a minute. She says later on, you know, anyway, it's just a bit. She was also talking about how and why did World Trade Center seven, which wasn't hit by an aircraft collapse. And for that matter, why did any of the World Trade Center buildings fall?
[03:24:39.480 --> 03:25:04.480]  Alex, this is the most tepid, the most entry level mousey mousey tongue to bring that pun in there. But it is it is it is nothing. But to show you how bereft, how dislocated, how disjointed the and let me stop from saying it's not mainstream media.
[03:25:04.480 --> 03:25:21.480]  This is mainstream media. There is no but how she merely says, Well, you know, this is worth a look. And maybe if you looked at this, it might be this is nothing. Alex, there is somewhere forged into them this patella obeisance that they're given.
[03:25:21.480 --> 03:25:35.480]  I guess this this manual that says, whenever you don't know what to say, try to link either conspiracy theory or truth or I cannot tell you the number of people I call to you said, Well, you know, they've linked her to being a true person.
[03:25:35.480 --> 03:25:46.480]  Do you know what she said? No, no, they didn't. This is from a news organization. Now, let me also pay something. And by the way, I've got to say something.
[03:25:46.480 --> 03:25:57.480]  Roseanne may be dying for all of our sins. Let me say something. I am not about Alex to explain or justify or or to whatever what Roseanne said.
[03:25:57.480 --> 03:26:11.480]  All I'm saying is that we want her to be treated the same that everybody else is. That's it. And nobody but nobody in this country is walking around going to work and saying, Did you see what Roseanne said about Valerie Jarrett?
[03:26:11.480 --> 03:26:21.480]  I'll bet you Google had more traffic. No, no, I got your point by them singling that out and then saying, Oh, look, they're calling black people monkeys.
[03:26:21.480 --> 03:26:29.480]  That was their racist interpretation of it. It's like somebody that sees dirtiness and everything. When it's her making a joke, they take it magnify it.
[03:26:29.480 --> 03:26:37.480]  Let's not be exaggerating a billion times what it would have been. And then giving their racist interpretation exactly like, like here's the deal.
[03:26:37.480 --> 03:26:43.480]  People were questioning what really happened to do have it because there were some anomalies. But early on, I said, probably happened. Who knows, looked at it.
[03:26:43.480 --> 03:26:48.480]  Then years later, I say, I believe it happened, blah, blah, blah. They take that as weakness and then go.
[03:26:48.480 --> 03:26:54.480]  Jones is currently saying nobody died. They send in Megan Kelly to then try to edit a tape of me saying it.
[03:26:54.480 --> 03:26:59.480]  I don't even say that on the edited tape. They couldn't even edit it to make it convincing. People even said it was edited.
[03:26:59.480 --> 03:27:07.480]  And then now they have articles in Reuters saying we need Peter Thiel to back shutting Alex Jones down. He's bullying families right now.
[03:27:07.480 --> 03:27:18.480]  We want to destroy Alex Jones. Reuters, you're the lawyer, is the one, this writer, this Cox guy. He's saying we want him bankrupt.
[03:27:18.480 --> 03:27:24.480]  We want him shut down. And then he's telling lies about me and distorting what I've said to shut me down.
[03:27:24.480 --> 03:27:28.480]  This is the definition, in my view, of the real defamation.
[03:27:28.480 --> 03:27:37.480]  Well, I want to also add this one particular point, which nobody else was bringing up regarding Roseanne, because I've been just fascinated by this.
[03:27:37.480 --> 03:27:43.480]  They were laughing at her about suggesting that she was tweeting under the influence of Ambien.
[03:27:43.480 --> 03:27:51.480]  Now, do you remember a while back, Representative, this is Patrick Kennedy, who showed up at the White House or the Capitol, excuse me,
[03:27:51.480 --> 03:27:57.480]  about three in the morning in his car and went through a barrier and might have been suffering from some substance abuse problems.
[03:27:57.480 --> 03:28:03.480]  And not to mock him, but he said, you know what, I'm taking some Ambien and it's very, it's a hypnotic.
[03:28:03.480 --> 03:28:10.480]  And the media then said, okay, fine, no problem. Say no more. Why didn't you say so?
[03:28:10.480 --> 03:28:14.480]  Roseanne says the very same thing. It's preposterous.
[03:28:14.480 --> 03:28:22.480]  Then when they don't understand what it was that she tweeted, which might be consistent with an Ambien defense, they have nothing to do with it.
[03:28:22.480 --> 03:28:28.480]  So they pick and choose because they lost after control of the language and the narrative.
[03:28:28.480 --> 03:28:31.480]  And they just want to be in charge of who can be on air and who can have a First Amendment.
[03:28:31.480 --> 03:28:33.480]  It's a war on the First Amendment.
[03:28:33.480 --> 03:28:38.480]  Lionel, you're taking over straight ahead. Godspeedlinalmedia.com. Stay with us.

[03:32:10.480 --> 03:32:13.480]  but boy, does it stimulate because it's beyond that.
[03:32:13.480 --> 03:32:19.480]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients,
[03:32:19.480 --> 03:32:25.480]  but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae.
[03:32:25.480 --> 03:32:29.480]  And I came up with our own formulae, working with some scientists and developers.
[03:32:29.480 --> 03:32:34.480]  Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[03:32:34.480 --> 03:32:37.480]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone to it,
[03:32:37.480 --> 03:32:43.480]  which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[03:32:43.480 --> 03:32:46.480]  It is amazing.

[03:33:49.480 --> 03:33:57.480]  Alex Jones for Alex Jones. Alex Jones from info wars.
[03:33:57.480 --> 03:34:00.980]  Did that stop him? No, it did not!
[03:34:00.980 --> 03:34:03.480]  It kept going, okay?
[03:34:03.480 --> 03:34:05.480]  And just it went everywhere.
[03:34:05.480 --> 03:34:11.480]  The more they abuse you, the more you enjoy it, just like the Stockholm syndrome.
[03:34:11.480 --> 03:34:14.480]  And so that's why the joke is on you.
[03:34:14.480 --> 03:34:16.480]  And that's why it's going to continue.
[03:34:16.480 --> 03:34:21.480]  Oh, here I am.
[03:34:21.480 --> 03:34:24.480]  Rock you like a hurricane.
[03:34:24.480 --> 03:34:26.480]  Repent now! Repent now!
[03:34:26.480 --> 03:34:28.480]  I know your mustache is cool!
[03:34:28.480 --> 03:34:30.480]  You got little gold frame glasses!
[03:34:30.480 --> 03:34:32.480]  You scared me so bad!
[03:34:39.480 --> 03:34:44.480]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[03:34:44.480 --> 03:34:47.480]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:34:47.480 --> 03:34:49.480]  And Lionel from New York City.
[03:34:49.480 --> 03:34:52.480]  You know, he brought up this fake Russian death and all this,
[03:34:52.480 --> 03:34:55.480]  but I forgot the Russians just put out a detailed report
[03:34:55.480 --> 03:34:58.480]  showing specific state department that came out last night.
[03:34:58.480 --> 03:35:05.480]  And U.S. foundations have spent, they were listing 10 billion the last eight years.
[03:35:05.480 --> 03:35:08.480]  Well, you count Ukraine, they had a CNN special with Soros,
[03:35:08.480 --> 03:35:11.480]  with Fariz Arkaria saying they spent 5 billion.
[03:35:11.480 --> 03:35:16.480]  And then don't believe Soros, you've got,
[03:35:16.480 --> 03:35:20.480]  is it Susan Rice or Powers in his press conference saying 5 billion?
[03:35:20.480 --> 03:35:22.480]  The point is, we can pull that report up,
[03:35:22.480 --> 03:35:24.480]  because I couldn't find it in my stack, I'm going to leave the show with it.
[03:35:24.480 --> 03:35:28.480]  About a lucifile, I'm just a truth-of-file.
[03:35:28.480 --> 03:35:34.480]  And you've got the West saying they're trying to overthrow the elections in Russia.
[03:35:34.480 --> 03:35:39.480]  You've got the West trying to do the same George Soros social engineering,
[03:35:39.480 --> 03:35:41.480]  his open foundation, open society groups there.
[03:35:41.480 --> 03:35:43.480]  It's crazy.
[03:35:43.480 --> 03:35:47.480]  Yeah, there's a report today, May 31st.
[03:35:47.480 --> 03:35:53.480]  Funding, NGOs and stirring dissent, Russia's special commission exposes election meddling by U.S.
[03:35:53.480 --> 03:35:56.480]  And here's the thing, it's open and shut,
[03:35:56.480 --> 03:35:58.480]  reprint that, I can't find it, thanks, it's open and shut.
[03:35:58.480 --> 03:36:00.480]  I read it this morning at like 5 a.m. when I woke up,
[03:36:00.480 --> 03:36:04.480]  I was going to leave the show with it, because the U.S. admits it,
[03:36:04.480 --> 03:36:06.480]  but I want to be clear, I'm red, white and blue.
[03:36:06.480 --> 03:36:09.480]  Trump has done energy deals that have savaged Russia, sorry, it's competition.
[03:36:09.480 --> 03:36:13.480]  Trump's done all sorts of stuff, he's not a lucifile, but he's not anti-Russia.
[03:36:13.480 --> 03:36:18.480]  But the deal is here, is that in the article, and I already knew all this because I've read the news,
[03:36:18.480 --> 03:36:22.480]  our government that's run by the globalists, the same ones that are demonizing America,
[03:36:22.480 --> 03:36:26.480]  demonizing Trump and me and everybody else, they're the globalists of hijacked the country,
[03:36:26.480 --> 03:36:29.480]  but it's globalists through America that have hijacked Russia,
[03:36:29.480 --> 03:36:35.480]  and then the Russians link all the admissions where U.S. officials are saying,
[03:36:35.480 --> 03:36:39.480]  we're trying to overthrow Russia, we're trying to put oligarchs back in.
[03:36:39.480 --> 03:36:45.480]  So it's open and shut, and that's what's so crazy is the Russians have incredible land,
[03:36:45.480 --> 03:36:50.480]  a lot of great weapons, good science, but they're problems that they're five to four times
[03:36:50.480 --> 03:36:55.480]  geographically size of the U.S. They don't kick it, the red likes to work nationwide.
[03:36:55.480 --> 03:36:58.480]  They're not trying to run us, it's the chai comms that are running everything,
[03:36:58.480 --> 03:37:01.480]  and I'm not against, the media goes, oh, you're against Asians.
[03:37:01.480 --> 03:37:04.480]  My sister's Korean adopted, I don't want to hear it, I love Asians.
[03:37:04.480 --> 03:37:08.480]  I hate communists, so yeah, here it is, the article's big, and what's crazy, Lionel,
[03:37:08.480 --> 03:37:12.480]  is it goes through the State Department and the CIA and the NGOs admitting
[03:37:12.480 --> 03:37:17.480]  that their tax-free point is to topple the Russian leadership.
[03:37:17.480 --> 03:37:22.480]  I mean, that takes some levos rancheros to be trying to overthrow Russia
[03:37:22.480 --> 03:37:27.480]  while you then point at American, died in the wool, flaming American firsters,
[03:37:27.480 --> 03:37:31.480]  who most of our families were fighting the Russians in the Cold War,
[03:37:31.480 --> 03:37:35.480]  by the way, kicking the living hell out of them. I mean, if you know what went on in Germany and everything,
[03:37:35.480 --> 03:37:40.480]  it was just massacring Germans, Russians, everything. I mean, everybody feared the U.S.
[03:37:40.480 --> 03:37:45.480]  And then the idea that those of us that are American firsters are now Russian agents,
[03:37:45.480 --> 03:37:50.480]  this whole thing, the wheels are coming off, so A, this new big report, which is their own admissions,
[03:37:50.480 --> 03:37:52.480]  and B, where does it go from there, Lionel, and then I'm out of here.
[03:37:52.480 --> 03:37:54.480]  I'm listening to you, I'm done, take over.
[03:37:54.480 --> 03:37:58.480]  Well, you realize, you know what you're doing, I hate to say this, and I love my country and my brother,
[03:37:58.480 --> 03:38:02.480]  but when you're talking about Russia, you might be talking about particle physics,
[03:38:02.480 --> 03:38:06.480]  because most people have the level and the depth of their understanding,
[03:38:06.480 --> 03:38:13.480]  it goes back to Boris and Natasha. I mean, this is like, you know, this, or I will bury you, Drago,
[03:38:13.480 --> 03:38:19.480]  and this weird kind of stuff. I mean, this is my favorite, you know, Alex, I'm a prosecutor,
[03:38:19.480 --> 03:38:24.480]  cut my teeth, and I know that I've been through, I did mass unit prosecuting,
[03:38:24.480 --> 03:38:30.480]  and I'm telling you, when you look at a case, especially a murder case, or attempted murder,
[03:38:30.480 --> 03:38:36.480]  a lot of it just makes sense, and boy, when it makes sense, it's unmistakable.
[03:38:36.480 --> 03:38:42.480]  Oh, when something doesn't make sense to you, you pay attention, and I always ask this question,
[03:38:42.480 --> 03:38:48.480]  and I always ask people, I said, do you think, do you think that Vladimir Putin's a smart guy?
[03:38:48.480 --> 03:38:50.480]  And people say, yes, and you always lead them into it.
[03:38:50.480 --> 03:38:55.480]  Okay. Now, let me just think about this. Imagine that right before his election,
[03:38:55.480 --> 03:38:59.480]  right before his election, when everybody's watching him, and before the FIFA Cup and everything,
[03:38:59.480 --> 03:39:06.480]  he decides to take somebody who was removed from prison during a prisoner exchange
[03:39:06.480 --> 03:39:13.480]  that he pardoned, that was in Russian prison, Skripal, could have killed him a million ways this Sunday
[03:39:13.480 --> 03:39:19.480]  in a variety, in a Russian prison, nobody would have even questioned it, but no, no, not him.
[03:39:19.480 --> 03:39:24.480]  So he lets him go, and then says, I've got an idea. I'm sure he called his higher-ups and says,
[03:39:24.480 --> 03:39:28.480]  okay, guys, hear me out. You know that guy that we, you know, the prisoner exchange yet,
[03:39:28.480 --> 03:39:31.480]  the one that we pardoned, yeah, the one that really don't care anymore about, yeah.
[03:39:31.480 --> 03:39:37.480]  The one, by the way, who, okay, we're going to use the most dilute form of, quote,
[03:39:37.480 --> 03:39:42.480]  chemical weaponry there is, and we're going to kill him in the UK right before my election.
[03:39:42.480 --> 03:39:45.480]  What do you think? And they're saying, what? I mean, it makes...
[03:39:45.480 --> 03:39:49.480]  And now it turns out, first it was him and the daughter died, now they won't say, what's the,
[03:39:49.480 --> 03:39:51.480]  I mean, this whole thing's a hoax.
[03:39:51.480 --> 03:39:55.480]  Well, be, oh, but you can't say that, oh, and what he said was...
[03:39:55.480 --> 03:40:00.480]  No, but it's like the chemical weapon attack turned out, this last one that almost got us to war didn't even happen.
[03:40:00.480 --> 03:40:05.480]  Right, now think about this, and you talk about, and these people have the unmitigated audacity,
[03:40:05.480 --> 03:40:14.480]  the elephantine wavles, the grand cojones, to say that this, that you and others are into fake news.
[03:40:14.480 --> 03:40:20.480]  We have a guy who was dead, who's, who's, who, this is, this, Alex.
[03:40:20.480 --> 03:40:24.480]  Yeah, say it up front, they claimed he was dead, now they say he's alive, and it's not even a news item.
[03:40:24.480 --> 03:40:26.480]  Right, they don't even, they don't even...
[03:40:26.480 --> 03:40:30.480]  For people that used to, Dan, we're going to put this in the front of the interview, explain what's happened.
[03:40:30.480 --> 03:40:34.480]  Hey, this guy's Lazarus, I mean, he...
[03:40:34.480 --> 03:40:45.480]  Well, he's, this is, this was a, a, a fixed, contrived death, and Boris Johnson Bojo apparently doesn't know this,
[03:40:45.480 --> 03:40:51.480]  and is tweeting our, our thoughts. I mean, this guy shows up, and people almost keel over.
[03:40:51.480 --> 03:40:53.480]  Look, I don't want to say...
[03:40:53.480 --> 03:40:55.480]  Well, I should have left the show with this, I should have said up front.
[03:40:55.480 --> 03:41:00.480]  This, this former KGB colonel and his daughter go in the store, they come out, they fall over on a bench,
[03:41:00.480 --> 03:41:03.480]  they'll never let the Russians have samples for months, no one sees it.
[03:41:03.480 --> 03:41:07.480]  The daughter's dead, he's dead, then they go, the daughter's alive, now he's alive and shows up.
[03:41:07.480 --> 03:41:11.480]  I mean, that's what I mean, it's like they think we have no memory, this whole thing is cuckoo level.
[03:41:11.480 --> 03:41:15.480]  Well, that, that's script Paul, that's a different story, but, but here, here's the thing too.
[03:41:15.480 --> 03:41:18.480]  No, I know, I'm saying that story too, so explain this one.
[03:41:18.480 --> 03:41:24.480]  Well, what's happening, this, I'm sorry, I don't mean to laugh.
[03:41:24.480 --> 03:41:29.480]  No, I know about the other case too, that's what I'm saying, as I brought the chemical weapons, it's insane.
[03:41:29.480 --> 03:41:35.480]  But what's happening right now is you have Boris Johnson, who, who is tweeting, doesn't even know he's not dead.
[03:41:35.480 --> 03:41:38.480]  Now understand this, the, when, when Tommy...
[03:41:38.480 --> 03:41:42.480]  This is another, this is another guy they let go and, so explain it.
[03:41:42.480 --> 03:41:47.480]  That woman, but when, when you go back, when, when Tommy Robinson, and I gotta go back to this, because your coverage of him,
[03:41:47.480 --> 03:41:53.480]  thank God you broke in for this, this is the one that absolutely, of course, hashtag Tommy Robinson.
[03:41:53.480 --> 03:42:05.480]  Guess who, think about this, the, the irony, you've got, of course, D, D noticed in the, in the UK, their own press told they cannot report on this story.
[03:42:05.480 --> 03:42:12.480]  Who had some of the best coverage? You, of course, and Sputnik and RT, Russian, Russian news organization.
[03:42:12.480 --> 03:42:14.480]  And it's only because they're not under this global control.
[03:42:14.480 --> 03:42:17.480]  My wife asked me at 10 a.m. She goes, why are you going in?
[03:42:17.480 --> 03:42:24.480]  And I said, I got a feeling hours later that, you know, the demonstration started. I just knew you're secretly arresting Tommy, lying about him.
[03:42:24.480 --> 03:42:27.480]  We got to cover it. And of course it blew up.
[03:42:27.480 --> 03:42:34.480]  But this is also, this goes to show you, and how, how these people thought that this was a good idea.
[03:42:34.480 --> 03:42:36.480]  I would have said, listen.
[03:42:36.480 --> 03:42:39.480]  But it's the arrogance of tyrants. And I'm not coming back. I'm going to watch you when you come back.
[03:42:39.480 --> 03:42:44.480]  Explain the arrogance of this to think that there's a huge pedophile ring, hearing going on.
[03:42:44.480 --> 03:42:47.480]  He's just saying there's a hearing. Not even saying what's in it.
[03:42:47.480 --> 03:43:16.480]  Stay with us.
[03:43:17.480 --> 03:43:21.480]  The U.S. has increased active shooter and emergency response training for local communities.
[03:43:21.480 --> 03:43:24.480]  And several pieces of legislation are up for debate.
[03:43:24.480 --> 03:43:34.480]  One such law would allow families, school administrators or police to petition that a potentially dangerous individual be kept from owning firearms after legal due process.
[03:43:34.480 --> 03:43:42.480]  While another would require that proper authorities be alerted within 48 hours of any change to a person's legal ability to own a gun.
[03:43:42.480 --> 03:43:49.480]  The U.S. says his plan provides strategies that can be used before the next school year begins to keep students safe when they return to school.

[03:47:20.480 --> 03:47:22.480]  Crazy!
[03:47:22.480 --> 03:47:24.480]  I gotta calm down.
[03:47:24.480 --> 03:47:25.480]  I'm serious.
[03:47:25.480 --> 03:47:28.480]  I don't even know where to start with this.
[03:47:28.480 --> 03:47:29.480]  Which story?
[03:47:29.480 --> 03:47:30.480]  Which?
[03:47:30.480 --> 03:47:34.480]  I gotta hand it to Alex because he gets me so psychically revved up.
[03:47:34.480 --> 03:47:38.480]  I don't even know where to start in the waning moments of this thing and it's an honor to be with you.
[03:47:38.480 --> 03:47:40.480]  Let me get down to simply this.
[03:47:40.480 --> 03:47:42.480]  This is what is on my top of mind.
[03:47:42.480 --> 03:47:45.480]  I've gotta share this with you.
[03:47:45.480 --> 03:47:56.480]  You know, when it became evident regarding the Roseanne case, most of the time people think that, wow, that's a new story.
[03:47:56.480 --> 03:47:59.480]  That's some entertainment story.
[03:47:59.480 --> 03:48:00.480]  It doesn't really matter.
[03:48:00.480 --> 03:48:01.480]  It's not important.
[03:48:01.480 --> 03:48:02.480]  It's not critical.
[03:48:02.480 --> 03:48:07.480]  Frank's happens at one time that Hollywood is the entertainment division or branch of the Pentagon.
[03:48:07.480 --> 03:48:14.480]  And paraphrasing that somewhat is that entertainment and what's happening there is a microcosm of what's happening elsewhere.
[03:48:14.480 --> 03:48:20.480]  You know, years ago, sports and the military were always great harbingers of what was happening.
[03:48:20.480 --> 03:48:22.480]  They were Pythonic and Vatican.
[03:48:22.480 --> 03:48:26.480]  You would read the entrails of the societal beast by watching what they did.
[03:48:26.480 --> 03:48:27.480]  Baseball was the first to integrate.
[03:48:27.480 --> 03:48:29.480]  The military integrated.
[03:48:29.480 --> 03:48:30.480]  Drug testing.
[03:48:30.480 --> 03:48:35.480]  Watch what they did first and then it permeated back into society.
[03:48:35.480 --> 03:48:39.480]  Entertainment today is this is the feeder system.
[03:48:39.480 --> 03:48:40.480]  This is the money system.
[03:48:40.480 --> 03:48:49.480]  This is the fundraising arm of the Democratic National Committee, the DNC, the professional left, the deep state, whatever you want to call it.
[03:48:49.480 --> 03:48:51.480]  What's happening is that they create the memes.
[03:48:51.480 --> 03:48:53.480]  They create the propaganda.
[03:48:53.480 --> 03:49:01.480]  They create the tropes and the memes and they send these out and they work in coordination with Hillary Clinton and others.
[03:49:01.480 --> 03:49:09.480]  So when you see, you see a Bob Iger and ABC or CNN or whatever, it's not just some news organization.
[03:49:09.480 --> 03:49:12.480]  Let me remind you something I said before in passing.
[03:49:12.480 --> 03:49:14.480]  Those used to be mainstream media.
[03:49:14.480 --> 03:49:16.480]  Those used to be what we would call mainstream media.
[03:49:16.480 --> 03:49:17.480]  That's not.
[03:49:17.480 --> 03:49:18.480]  This is mainstream media.
[03:49:18.480 --> 03:49:21.480]  What we're seeing right now, what we're doing, this is mainstream media.
[03:49:21.480 --> 03:49:23.480]  This is as mainstream as it gets.
[03:49:23.480 --> 03:49:24.480]  And it may be louder.
[03:49:24.480 --> 03:49:31.480]  It may be more informal, but it is more information packed, more intellectually calorie dense than anything you've ever seen before.
[03:49:31.480 --> 03:49:33.480]  So this is now mainstream media.
[03:49:33.480 --> 03:49:37.480]  So when Roseanne came along, I said simply this.
[03:49:37.480 --> 03:49:47.480]  We as Americans, and I truly believe this, in my countrymen, us, and I think humans believe in this natural law notion called parody, parody comedy, C-O-M-I-T-Y.
[03:49:47.480 --> 03:49:57.480]  Parody, equal treatment, equal justice, equal treatment, equal justice under the law, the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment, equality, justice with the scales.
[03:49:57.480 --> 03:50:00.480]  We have this thing about treat me like everybody else.
[03:50:00.480 --> 03:50:07.480]  The notion of equal protection says, why are you treating African Americans or Asians different than whatever you have to be able to justify?
[03:50:07.480 --> 03:50:08.480]  Why?
[03:50:08.480 --> 03:50:14.480]  Because believe it or not, in this country, we treat some people differently, minors, convicted felons, men versus women.
[03:50:14.480 --> 03:50:17.480]  Sometimes you can do it, but it depends why.
[03:50:17.480 --> 03:50:21.480]  So Roseanne Barr came along and she said, I'm going to do this show again.
[03:50:21.480 --> 03:50:22.480]  I'm going to retool.
[03:50:22.480 --> 03:50:23.480]  I'm going to do it.
[03:50:23.480 --> 03:50:26.480]  And at that moment, they huddled.
[03:50:26.480 --> 03:50:30.480]  I don't know this for a fact, I am just imagining this.
[03:50:30.480 --> 03:50:34.480]  I'm just giving you my kind of an idea, theoretical perhaps.
[03:50:34.480 --> 03:50:37.480]  They got together and they say, this cannot work.
[03:50:37.480 --> 03:50:38.480]  They say, but it's got to work.
[03:50:38.480 --> 03:50:40.480]  No, no, this cannot work.
[03:50:40.480 --> 03:50:41.480]  This is way for ABC.
[03:50:41.480 --> 03:50:43.480]  No, no, no, no.
[03:50:43.480 --> 03:50:48.480]  For some reason, Roseanne has been forged and connected with the notion of Trump.
[03:50:48.480 --> 03:50:52.480]  Don't ask me why she is Trump.
[03:50:52.480 --> 03:50:59.480]  And if she succeeds, this will be the message that we have been trying to avoid for years,
[03:50:59.480 --> 03:51:06.480]  that we in Hollywood, we, the entertainment division of the military industrial complex,
[03:51:06.480 --> 03:51:08.480]  we've been trying to promote propaganda.
[03:51:08.480 --> 03:51:10.480]  And they've been saying, no, you don't understand.
[03:51:10.480 --> 03:51:11.480]  They share our views.
[03:51:11.480 --> 03:51:15.480]  They share who we are and we know what they're doing.
[03:51:15.480 --> 03:51:16.480]  No.
[03:51:16.480 --> 03:51:17.480]  So Roseanne tweeted this thing.
[03:51:17.480 --> 03:51:19.480]  Okay, I'm not even going to describe it.
[03:51:19.480 --> 03:51:20.480]  Defend it.
[03:51:20.480 --> 03:51:21.480]  You do that.
[03:51:21.480 --> 03:51:22.480]  You care what it is.
[03:51:22.480 --> 03:51:23.480]  Okay.
[03:51:23.480 --> 03:51:29.480]  So I would say, well, you should treat Roseanne like everybody else who said equally terrible
[03:51:29.480 --> 03:51:30.480]  things.
[03:51:30.480 --> 03:51:34.480]  And by the way, this extra judicial kind of review of what somebody does, this is what
[03:51:34.480 --> 03:51:37.480]  we call in law a collateral matter, collateral issue.
[03:51:37.480 --> 03:51:41.480]  You know, when something is not really germane to what we're talking about, it's collateral.
[03:51:41.480 --> 03:51:44.480]  It's like if you lie in court, it's not really perjury.
[03:51:44.480 --> 03:51:48.480]  If it's about a collateral matter, something about the color of the shirt you were wearing,
[03:51:48.480 --> 03:51:50.480]  if it's not germane to the gaze.
[03:51:50.480 --> 03:51:56.200]  So if somebody is on their own time tweeting something stupid, far be it from me, what
[03:51:56.200 --> 03:51:57.880]  does it have to do with the show?
[03:51:57.880 --> 03:52:03.560]  Well, this has become merged, has become merged, and it's become this, this minefield,
[03:52:03.560 --> 03:52:05.880]  this tripwire, this third rail.
[03:52:05.880 --> 03:52:10.400]  And what people do right now is even in their profile, they'll say retweets do not mean
[03:52:10.400 --> 03:52:14.400]  an endorsement of ratification and, you know, an endorsement of, of a particular thought
[03:52:14.400 --> 03:52:15.400]  or idea.
[03:52:15.400 --> 03:52:16.400]  Okay.
[03:52:16.400 --> 03:52:17.400]  So here's Roseanne.
[03:52:17.400 --> 03:52:21.680]  Now, they've known about Roseanne forever.
[03:52:21.680 --> 03:52:22.680]  That's why they hired her.
[03:52:22.680 --> 03:52:27.720]  The reason why Roseanne is great is because she's who she is.
[03:52:27.720 --> 03:52:38.120]  She is this bold body in your face, risky, Lenny Bruce, George Carter, go through history,
[03:52:38.120 --> 03:52:42.120]  find anybody, and it sounds, I mean, if you ever heard of Lenny Bruce routine, it's pretty
[03:52:42.120 --> 03:52:44.400]  pale by comparison, but at the time it was cutting edge.
[03:52:44.400 --> 03:52:46.140]  So they knew who she was.
[03:52:46.140 --> 03:52:48.520]  She was tweeting the whole time, she's been doing this.
[03:52:48.520 --> 03:52:50.520]  So they said we're going to hire her.
[03:52:50.520 --> 03:52:55.200]  They knew exactly what she was to say the couple who gets the, you know, the pit bull,
[03:52:55.200 --> 03:52:59.360]  the pit bull bite somebody, not the pit bulls are bad, but then again, you blame the dog.
[03:52:59.360 --> 03:53:01.240]  The dog said, this is what I'm trying to do.
[03:53:01.240 --> 03:53:02.840]  This is what you wanted me to do.
[03:53:02.840 --> 03:53:03.840]  Okay.
[03:53:03.840 --> 03:53:04.920]  So she does this.
[03:53:04.920 --> 03:53:09.840]  And they wanted her to fail from the beginning because believe it or not, they are so committed
[03:53:09.840 --> 03:53:13.720]  to the idea that this ideology must fail if they would even lose millions of dollars
[03:53:13.720 --> 03:53:15.240]  to say, aha, we told you.
[03:53:15.240 --> 03:53:16.680]  See, it just doesn't work.
[03:53:16.680 --> 03:53:17.960]  You got that Tim Allen.
[03:53:17.960 --> 03:53:19.560]  You got that Clint Eastwood.
[03:53:19.560 --> 03:53:20.560]  You got that.
[03:53:20.560 --> 03:53:28.400]  And by the by the number of people in Hollywood who are closeted conservatives, closeted Trump
[03:53:28.400 --> 03:53:33.440]  supporters, closeted, in fact, everybody's closet because Hollywood is a lie as you
[03:53:33.440 --> 03:53:37.000]  know that, but she had to fail.
[03:53:37.000 --> 03:53:40.760]  So anyway, so she starts off and they said, oh, let's see what happens.
[03:53:40.760 --> 03:53:43.320]  Blockbuster biggest thing anybody's ever seen.
[03:53:43.320 --> 03:53:44.320]  Why?
[03:53:44.320 --> 03:53:49.360]  And next with America, the middle of the Gaussian curve, the middle of the bell curve.
[03:53:49.360 --> 03:53:54.880]  That's who America is main street, Midwest, whatever it is, families in a little town
[03:53:54.880 --> 03:53:58.760]  in a bad couch with an Afghan and worried about stuff.
[03:53:58.760 --> 03:53:59.760]  That's who she was.
[03:53:59.760 --> 03:54:02.040]  That's who the old show was with the new show.
[03:54:02.040 --> 03:54:03.040]  Okay.
[03:54:03.040 --> 03:54:08.000]  There's some interesting things about children wearing tutus and okay, fine.
[03:54:08.000 --> 03:54:13.160]  It just kept getting better and better and bigger and blowing up.
[03:54:13.160 --> 03:54:18.800]  She had bigger ratings and now from 20 years ago to a different platforms to even be even
[03:54:18.800 --> 03:54:19.800]  greater.
[03:54:19.800 --> 03:54:24.080]  So they were waiting, waiting for her because she represented.
[03:54:24.080 --> 03:54:28.800]  I don't want to say us, but she represented a group of people that Hollywood wanted to
[03:54:28.800 --> 03:54:33.280]  distance themselves from what they waited and they waited, what they got her.
[03:54:33.280 --> 03:54:34.280]  They got her.
[03:54:34.280 --> 03:54:37.880]  The Bob Iger when he calls her Valerie Jarrett, let me tell you something.
[03:54:37.880 --> 03:54:40.120]  Look at me and listen to me.
[03:54:40.120 --> 03:54:43.740]  It doesn't care about this, doesn't care.
[03:54:43.740 --> 03:54:46.720]  You ask anybody, you pull somebody up and give them some kind of truth serum, put some
[03:54:46.720 --> 03:54:51.360]  kind of truth detector, look at the way, just ask them, do you really care about this?
[03:54:51.360 --> 03:54:53.880]  Do you care about this?
[03:54:53.880 --> 03:54:57.960]  Even the people who are the most art, the most vocal, they don't care about this because
[03:54:57.960 --> 03:54:58.960]  it's part of a game.
[03:54:58.960 --> 03:55:05.120]  It's like the guy who was taught and he's raised from a young age to hate the red socks.
[03:55:05.120 --> 03:55:06.640]  He's a diehard Yankee.
[03:55:06.640 --> 03:55:08.880]  This is not about issues.
[03:55:08.880 --> 03:55:12.040]  It's about feeling and gut and my side versus your side.
[03:55:12.040 --> 03:55:17.080]  So all this Roseanne case is about is simply this, very simply treat her like everybody
[03:55:17.080 --> 03:55:18.080]  else.
[03:55:18.080 --> 03:55:20.240]  Now, in the meantime, we have this Samantha Bee case.
[03:55:20.240 --> 03:55:21.240]  Pay attention to that.
[03:55:21.240 --> 03:55:22.240]  How are they going to handle that?
[03:55:22.240 --> 03:55:23.880]  Next, you've got Joy Reed.
[03:55:23.880 --> 03:55:28.480]  Joy Reed, who by the way was far more Islamophobic and xenophobic and all the phobics than you
[03:55:28.480 --> 03:55:29.480]  could imagine.
[03:55:29.480 --> 03:55:33.200]  Then the other day, MSD and she had that round table, that chart.
[03:55:33.200 --> 03:55:34.200]  It was Valerie Jarrett.
[03:55:34.200 --> 03:55:40.600]  Of course, it was Al Sharpton, Chris Hayes, Joy Reed, by the way, Al Sharpton in a weird
[03:55:40.600 --> 03:55:41.600]  way.
[03:55:41.600 --> 03:55:42.600]  I admire him.
[03:55:42.600 --> 03:55:43.600]  Let me tell you something.
[03:55:43.600 --> 03:55:49.640]  Al Sharpton, if you ever meet him is one of the nicest, most ingratiating, friendly people
[03:55:49.640 --> 03:55:51.200]  you've ever met in your life.
[03:55:51.200 --> 03:55:52.200]  True story.
[03:55:52.200 --> 03:55:53.200]  True.
[03:55:53.200 --> 03:55:54.960]  He has been hit with so much stuff.
[03:55:54.960 --> 03:55:57.760]  He is almost impermeable.
[03:55:57.760 --> 03:56:00.880]  He's like this bacteria resistant bug.
[03:56:00.880 --> 03:56:02.280]  You can't kill it.
[03:56:02.280 --> 03:56:03.480]  You can't hurt it.
[03:56:03.480 --> 03:56:05.360]  He has been hit with everything from Tawanna, Bali.
[03:56:05.360 --> 03:56:06.800]  So there's that.
[03:56:06.800 --> 03:56:08.320]  Right now, they are scrambling.
[03:56:08.320 --> 03:56:13.600]  What's happening right now in the waiting minutes, listen to me, Roseanne is not about
[03:56:13.600 --> 03:56:14.920]  a TV show.
[03:56:14.920 --> 03:56:15.920]  It's about us.
[03:56:15.920 --> 03:56:21.920]  It's about right versus wrong, and it's about a faction of America that nobody ever addresses.
[03:56:21.920 --> 03:56:23.760]  Nobody, repeat, look at me.
[03:56:23.760 --> 03:56:26.040]  Nobody cares about what Roseanne said.
[03:56:26.040 --> 03:56:28.760]  Nobody knows who Valerie Jarrett is.
[03:56:28.760 --> 03:56:30.600]  This is an excuse.
[03:56:30.600 --> 03:56:32.040]  It was the tripwire.
[03:56:32.040 --> 03:56:34.600]  It was the oops, we've got her.
[03:56:34.600 --> 03:56:39.600]  Watch what happens now and watch what happens as the next thing.
[03:56:39.600 --> 03:56:45.920]  And Roseanne, if you're listening, your future is going to be in a platform similar to this
[03:56:45.920 --> 03:56:53.120]  where you can say whatever you'd like and you will be overwhelmed with love, adoration,
[03:56:53.120 --> 03:57:00.520]  peons, pedagyrics, fealty, and an embrace of you, the likes of which you have never
[03:57:00.520 --> 03:57:01.520]  seen.
[03:57:01.520 --> 03:57:04.120]  All right, my friends, I believe that is it for me.
[03:57:04.120 --> 03:57:08.600]  Alex Jones, thank you so much for allowing me to be with you today and to the staff and
[03:57:08.600 --> 03:57:09.760]  the support individuals.
[03:57:09.760 --> 03:57:10.760]  Thank you so much.
[03:57:10.760 --> 03:57:11.760]  Thank you for paying attention.
[03:57:11.760 --> 03:57:17.160]  Please remember, always think and always, always question authority and comment as you
[03:57:17.160 --> 03:57:18.160]  see fit.
[03:57:18.160 --> 03:57:33.460]  Hi.
[03:57:33.460 --> 03:57:45.920]  I'm Eric Jarrett.
[03:57:45.920 --> 03:57:50.480]  and an iron curtain of censorship is ascending down over the UK.
[03:57:50.480 --> 03:57:56.000]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays,
[03:57:56.000 --> 03:57:58.400]  you'll get six months in prison.
[03:57:58.400 --> 03:58:02.160]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[03:58:02.160 --> 03:58:06.720]  CNN and many others are calling for info wars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[03:58:06.720 --> 03:58:09.520]  Slate magazine has a professor and others saying,
[03:58:09.520 --> 03:58:14.080]  go beyond censorship, brainwash young people against info wars.
[03:58:14.080 --> 03:58:18.800]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[03:58:18.800 --> 03:58:22.240]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[03:58:22.240 --> 03:58:25.040]  It is so critical that you go to infowars.com,

[03:58:38.880 --> 03:58:43.920]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[03:58:43.920 --> 03:58:48.960]  President Trump gave a speech on Friday at the Naval Academy for their commencement and said,

[03:58:50.880 --> 03:58:53.360]  Hollywood does not have the megaphone anymore,
