[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.880]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.880 --> 00:28.480]  well I was chomping at the bit last night this morning to get in here in this studio and go
[00:28.480 --> 00:35.520]  live today it is August 2nd 2011 we're gonna be live here for at least the next three hours
[00:37.440 --> 00:43.200]  we knew that they were attempting to set up a super congress a council of 13 to bypass the
[00:43.200 --> 00:48.720]  constitution the bill of rights the congress and fully put us into the hands of the offshore
[00:49.280 --> 00:53.200]  global crime syndicate known as the New World Order we know that Mitch McConnell
[00:53.200 --> 00:57.200]  had tried to just completely hand the power of the purse over to the president bypassing
[00:57.200 --> 01:03.280]  congress two weeks ago he openly made those announcements but people recoiled and the president
[01:03.280 --> 01:08.880]  said I can just use the 14th amendment that was used against the states post civil war during
[01:08.880 --> 01:13.840]  reconstruction and every constitutional scholar out there said this is outrageous this is this is
[01:13.840 --> 01:25.040]  the military dictatorship of Lincoln and Ulysses S. Grant and so instead they created a lawyer
[01:25.040 --> 01:33.120]  facade but when you look at the details in plain view it is outrageous it is off the charts and
[01:33.120 --> 01:38.000]  we're going to be breaking it down today pastor Chuck Baldwin presidential candidate for the
[01:38.000 --> 01:42.080]  constitution party of course last round is going to be joining us to get into a host of issues
[01:42.080 --> 01:46.720]  including this and Romans 13 how Christians are taught to submit to the tyranny of government
[01:46.720 --> 01:50.720]  and how unbiblical that is and even if you're not a Christian the issue is is the majority of
[01:50.720 --> 01:55.440]  Americans are Christians and are taught bow down and worship government you know if you're a Nazi
[01:55.440 --> 02:03.120]  Germany lick the boots of Hitler it's of the Lord it couldn't be more unbiblical and uncommon sense
[02:04.240 --> 02:10.000]  but getting back uh to the super congress it passed last night in the house and they said
[02:10.000 --> 02:16.400]  they've got the votes the next few hours in the senate and it sets up six members of the house six
[02:16.400 --> 02:20.320]  in the senate they're the only ones that get to vote and then the president has a veto so he's
[02:20.320 --> 02:25.440]  he's the 13th member or it's like they're his disciples and he's the new abomination that we
[02:25.440 --> 02:29.840]  must bow down and worship and of course this power will be passed on to the next uh tyrant
[02:30.800 --> 02:35.200]  they just get worse and worse because we're deeper uh into this tyranny and they've
[02:35.200 --> 02:38.480]  set the precedent to launch wars without congressional approval carbon taxes without
[02:38.480 --> 02:45.920]  congressional approval atf putting new laws in that aren't even laws uh it is again outrageous
[02:45.920 --> 02:51.040]  uh what we're witnessing warrantless wiretapping totally illegal constitution completely burned
[02:51.040 --> 02:57.120]  to a crisp the enemy dancing in its ashes and they're having to openly get rid of the
[02:57.120 --> 03:00.960]  constitution below rights because they've engineered a controlled depression and they've
[03:00.960 --> 03:07.200]  got to ride the tiger now they've got to ride this buck and bronco or this wild uh bull uh or
[03:07.200 --> 03:12.160]  they're all going to go to prison and so it is a criminal class combined together with a bunch of
[03:12.160 --> 03:19.520]  moronic freshman house members most of them who don't know which end is up and i saw an
[03:19.520 --> 03:24.080]  incredible editorial in fact i forgot to print it guys if you just type in new york times says
[03:24.080 --> 03:30.480]  compares tea parties to terrorists they actually say the tea party terrorist almost destroyed
[03:30.480 --> 03:36.480]  america but thank god uh sanity prevailed ladies and gentlemen under this agreement of
[03:36.480 --> 03:43.440]  it passes the senate on all issues as harry reid and others have said not just taxes not just
[03:43.440 --> 03:47.680]  spending not just cuts which is basically government itself that's the key the heart
[03:47.680 --> 03:53.120]  of it the power to tax power to destroy the power to give the favors to the insiders and
[03:53.120 --> 03:59.280]  cut off everybody else as we've seen with the power plants and the all the rest of it uh the
[03:59.280 --> 04:13.440]  healthcare waivers they say no fellow busters and no amendments and now bills cannot originate
[04:13.440 --> 04:18.000]  from a single house member and then be looked at and scrutinized by others who then cosponsor
[04:18.000 --> 04:23.680]  and then bring it to a vote it kills the republic it did you hear what i just said because words
[04:23.680 --> 04:30.480]  can't describe this it kills the legislative branch effectively and hands it over to a super congress
[04:31.280 --> 04:38.960]  to a committee with the president with the veto power and it gets worse when they bring
[04:38.960 --> 04:43.200]  the legislation they've packaged out of the super committee the 12 member council with the president
[04:43.200 --> 04:49.040]  is the 13th leader sauron when the ring rates bring that to the house and senate they can vote
[04:49.040 --> 04:54.880]  it up or down and then in the house or senate doesn't vote on what they proposed get this get this

[08:23.360 --> 08:30.000]  done if they are allowed to pass this bill in the senate that's now past the house and if the criminal
[08:30.000 --> 08:38.320]  government that occupies this nation for the foreign offshore banks is able to carry this out
[08:38.960 --> 08:45.440]  now i shot six emergency videos last night that are up at info wars dot com
[08:46.000 --> 08:54.800]  erin dykes did a special info wars breaking news special report they were up here till midnight
[08:54.800 --> 09:01.600]  last night i didn't even have to tell them to do it they knew how important it was and so they
[09:01.600 --> 09:07.680]  stayed up here till midnight to put that special report out i almost never call other talk show
[09:07.680 --> 09:12.960]  hosts than i know and beg them to look at the information and cover it on their shows and i
[09:12.960 --> 09:20.320]  appreciate some of those talk show hosts doing that but i almost ran off the road yesterday
[09:20.320 --> 09:28.720]  uh as i uh was getting news alerts at at red lights uh reading what was confirmed in the language
[09:29.520 --> 09:37.600]  of the so-called debt ceiling uh agreement i knew that this had all been proposed and i even knew
[09:37.600 --> 09:41.680]  that our guests yesterday had said that they had actually reviewed it all that this was a
[09:41.680 --> 09:50.800]  executive coup but by the time i got home last night and spent the entire evening until one in
[09:50.800 --> 09:58.000]  the morning so from about 6 30 until one in the morning researching it reading the text reading
[09:58.000 --> 10:06.400]  mainline cbs news analysis abc hoping that i was looking at this wrong but also marveling
[10:06.400 --> 10:12.800]  that this is how republics die not with a bang but with a whimper remember three months ago
[10:12.800 --> 10:17.840]  ron paul said uh well they've launched a war in libya and they haven't gotten congressional approval
[10:17.840 --> 10:23.200]  and obama says he doesn't need it or want it uh this is the last nail in the republic's coffin
[10:23.200 --> 10:28.800]  if we allow this to continue because now the sky's the limit and that's the issue they remember just
[10:28.800 --> 10:33.600]  five years ago george w bush saying we don't spy on americans without warrants i promise in a press
[10:33.600 --> 10:38.240]  conference and two years later it came out there listening to everything without warrants and now
[10:38.240 --> 10:42.880]  it's just yeah we're tracking everything we're listening to everything it's not legal but we just
[10:42.880 --> 10:48.320]  do it it's not legal for obama to give insiders health care waivers which give them unfair
[10:48.320 --> 10:53.360]  trade advantage and it's complete discrimination but they do it it's not legal for the epa to put
[10:53.360 --> 11:00.160]  carbon taxes in against select groups that aren't insiders and give waivers to insiders but they do
[11:00.160 --> 11:05.280]  it it's not legal in chicago for the public schools to say you can't pack your child to lunch
[11:05.280 --> 11:10.160]  quote you're not trusted they said we can't trust you it's not legal when it's not even law in oak
[11:10.160 --> 11:14.400]  park michigan to say we're going to put you in jail for 93 days and give you a five thousand dollar
[11:14.400 --> 11:23.120]  fine for a tomato box uh in your yard but they do it it's not legal for the atf to ship close to 30
[11:23.120 --> 11:28.160]  thousand guns into mexico over the last two years that's killed five cops three board patrol agents
[11:28.160 --> 11:32.560]  and then perjure themselves to congress saying they didn't do it and then to be caught doing it
[11:32.560 --> 11:40.000]  and shipping them all over the u.s to select gangs and they don't get in trouble so tyranny
[11:40.000 --> 11:45.120]  always grows slowly and incrementally and then it starts to speed up to a gallop and then a run
[11:45.120 --> 11:53.040]  and now a mad foaming at the mouth 110 race we are being overrun and that's why they're grabbing
[11:53.040 --> 11:58.400]  private pension funds public pension funds stealing the veterans death benefits stealing the uh
[11:59.040 --> 12:04.240]  funds for their future care they are taking everything including the kitchen sink and
[12:04.240 --> 12:08.480]  they're pulling boards out of the walls and the flooring up and now they're pulling the super
[12:08.480 --> 12:16.240]  structure down i mean it is like a million piranhas and america is a big fat hog drop the middle
[12:16.240 --> 12:22.640]  of the amazon and a million piranhas are hitting us and hitting us hard and and i do not have words
[12:22.640 --> 12:29.280]  to describe the proof the documentation the nakedness of it and a lot of people are sending
[12:29.280 --> 12:34.240]  me emails and and seeing comments and getting calls where's ron paul where's ron paul well
[12:35.680 --> 12:39.440]  he talked about the super congress being tyranny he talked about it being bad in the last few weeks
[12:39.440 --> 12:45.680]  as they proposed it uh but he did put out a statement last night saying this is very troubling
[12:45.680 --> 12:50.640]  it neutralizes the rest of the house and senate now we can't block tax increases or gun control
[12:50.640 --> 12:59.040]  so people are saying where's ron paul well he was there last night 75 almost 76 working i saw his
[12:59.040 --> 13:03.040]  report come out at 10 o'clock at night so but again ron paul's back because he worked till 10
[13:03.040 --> 13:09.200]  o'clock at night or later uh where's ron paul why is he talking about this he was talking about it
[13:09.200 --> 13:15.360]  go to his website just because he didn't you didn't instantly see him on cnn i'm sorry i'm sorry
[13:15.360 --> 13:19.600]  one of my pet peeves has become people going why it now it's covering this or that when i've
[13:19.600 --> 13:24.880]  covered whatever subject it is 50 million times all right i'm a little angry i'm gonna try not to
[13:24.880 --> 13:29.280]  overheat here and blow up because i need to go over this information let me just read you the
[13:29.280 --> 13:35.920]  headlines here super congress to target second amendment gun owners of america and they've got
[13:35.920 --> 13:43.280]  the quotes from harry reid and abc news cbs and i even found the video last night openly saying
[13:43.280 --> 13:50.480]  this covers everything we can cover we can do everything here's ron paul paul joseph watson
[13:50.480 --> 13:55.440]  has an article on it ron paul sounds alarm on disturbing super congress and then uh
[13:55.440 --> 14:01.200]  disturbing is like the titanic hitting the iceberg and saying it's disturbing uh and then ron paul
[14:01.200 --> 14:07.040]  goes into saying it's extraordinary new powers undemocratic um seizing control fast track we
[14:07.040 --> 14:11.360]  can pass taxes gun control we're going to go over all of that here's another one weekly standard
[14:11.360 --> 14:16.640]  fiscal conservatives barred from super committee it's not a super committee that's the words of
[14:16.640 --> 14:23.840]  harry reid it is a it is a all powerful council of 12 with the 13th member with absolute veto power
[14:24.800 --> 14:30.080]  that's el presidente now here's another great article uh that breaks it down the debt crisis
[14:30.080 --> 14:34.240]  is a trojan horse to cause the fall of america that's designed to bring us into receivership
[14:34.240 --> 14:41.120]  i'm at grumbling from both sides senate scheduled to vote on debt deal today
[14:42.560 --> 14:49.520]  npr morning examiner no good can come from super congress and it breaks down the issues
[14:49.520 --> 14:58.720]  but but still this is all mild responses to it mild let me succinctly break this down for you and
[14:58.720 --> 15:04.240]  then i'll go to mainstream news saying it with the quotes so so you understand and i have the text
[15:04.240 --> 15:11.120]  of the agreement it is a totally open-ended power grab worse than the quote debt deal
[15:12.800 --> 15:19.520]  leaving an open window per week of 800 plus billion a week that the private federal reserve
[15:19.520 --> 15:26.960]  could run up on america's credit card in october third 2008 27 trillion we haven't gotten numbers
[15:26.960 --> 15:32.880]  in a year 27 trillion over 70 of it going to foreign offshore banks and domestic media your
[15:32.880 --> 15:39.440]  tax money i mean this is a payoff this is a buy-off for a systematic corporate takeover of america
[15:39.440 --> 15:44.400]  it's not coming like the soviet russians or hitler or the chai comms it's not coming with
[15:44.400 --> 15:52.080]  tanks and airborne troops coming down like red dawn it's all done by oily criminals who have for
[15:52.080 --> 15:57.520]  decades taken over every position of power in the federal government and in the bureaucracy and in
[15:57.520 --> 16:04.880]  most the states and they under the presidential decision directives under the john warden defense
[16:04.880 --> 16:09.200]  authorization act that bush started no bomb is cemented they say we don't need to hear from 50
[16:09.200 --> 16:13.200]  governors we've appointed 10 that speak for the states we don't need to hear from your local
[16:13.200 --> 16:19.600]  rural people we've set up a rural council under the department of defense and homeland security
[16:19.600 --> 16:27.520]  this is a total martial law takeover incrementally but now we're getting up to flashpoint they've
[16:27.520 --> 16:32.880]  been building all this up growing their tentacles infiltrating everything doing it all in plain
[16:32.880 --> 16:38.080]  view so mostly unconscious people bureaucrats cops military general public city councils
[16:38.800 --> 16:43.920]  this is all done very calmly very straight faced i mean it's a it's almost like harry reid and
[16:43.920 --> 16:49.840]  bainer and obama came out and calmly said um by the way uh the temperature today will be 102
[16:50.720 --> 16:55.920]  here in dc and uh there's going to be a meeting down at the park later we're going to be handing
[16:55.920 --> 17:01.200]  out some free popsicles and uh talking about by-thickle safety and uh oh by the way a giant
[17:01.200 --> 17:06.320]  10 mile wide spacecraft just landed uh mile away and there's green aliens running around now
[17:06.320 --> 17:13.280]  back to weather i mean it's that crazy but they just kind of well like you do something in church
[17:13.280 --> 17:17.600]  you let something out real slow in church make sure nobody's looking at you and then act like it
[17:17.600 --> 17:23.840]  wasn't you that's what they've done and and people it blows me we have all these experts on all these
[17:23.840 --> 17:28.400]  economists all these historians and most of the time it's my staffs pointed this out and others
[17:28.400 --> 17:33.440]  i know more than they do i don't think of myself as that smart but i guess i do spend 15 16 17
[17:33.440 --> 17:38.320]  18 hours a day and lose sleep because i'm so obsessed with reality studying everything
[17:38.320 --> 17:44.080]  so i can tie everything together and it's just but it's not even hard they they have set up
[17:44.080 --> 17:52.080]  something in 235 years that's never existed we're six members of the house six members of the senate
[17:52.080 --> 17:58.480]  and the president with the veto power over it bills don't originate from members of the house
[17:58.480 --> 18:03.360]  anymore anybody can introduce a bill and then get cosponsors and have it debated and for six
[18:03.360 --> 18:10.960]  months it's in committee and looked at from every angle no listen to me carefully i can't even
[18:10.960 --> 18:16.640]  believe this is happening even though i knew it was all coming it's the fact that it's done and
[18:16.640 --> 18:25.200]  very few people even get what they're seeing here listen to me 12 in the house six in the house

[24:22.560 --> 24:28.800]  we are reportedly hours away from the senate passing the same thing the house and senate
[24:29.440 --> 24:35.280]  are not allowed to hand away their authority but they are basically signing a treaty with
[24:35.280 --> 24:40.880]  their vote with six members of the house six of the senate and the executive a treason is
[24:40.880 --> 24:45.680]  treaty could the house and senate sign a treaty to let the un run america well they have people
[24:45.680 --> 24:50.720]  on television telling us that that's the case and then international law trumps our law and that
[24:50.720 --> 24:55.600]  the un says we can go to war so we can go to war we don't need a congress that's what's happening
[24:55.600 --> 25:01.120]  and it's called the overthrow of our political system but they call it a committee or a super
[25:01.120 --> 25:08.480]  congress no if they vote to create a committee that will then try to organize the different
[25:08.480 --> 25:13.680]  bills that are still voted on and then that committee comes forward with the final bill
[25:13.680 --> 25:22.320]  that's what a committee is a committee is not six in the house six in the senate where they
[25:23.040 --> 25:28.240]  originate the legislation that's not how legislation is originated this is a whole new
[25:28.240 --> 25:38.560]  form of government a hordom a legion of doom a legion of corruption 12 wicked mafioso ringraith
[25:38.560 --> 25:47.600]  craven scumbag traders in fact there's a headline right there super congress debt
[25:47.600 --> 25:53.200]  ceiling negotiators aim to create new legislative body that's the huffington post in fact let me
[25:53.200 --> 26:04.400]  just go through these so so so this is happening right out in the face of everyone i come this
[26:04.400 --> 26:11.600]  is the equivalent of july 4th but a bad july 4th if it passes today it's past the house
[26:11.600 --> 26:21.440]  august 2nd will be known as the date that a disgusting 13 member dictatorship was created
[26:21.440 --> 26:27.440]  and the president has the veto power so he's the dictator and he has these 12 wicked generals and
[26:27.440 --> 26:32.720]  because they sit there and say it in real boring terms and look down and fidget and and talk about
[26:32.720 --> 26:36.480]  how it's a victory for america and we have heard it collapse that's why they built it up we're
[26:36.480 --> 26:40.080]  going to collapse and we don't get this agreement this agreement made all about debt and cuts and
[26:40.080 --> 26:47.040]  what are we going to cut that's not what they were after that was all a smokescreen hidden in 100
[26:47.040 --> 26:57.840]  percent plain total view a new form of government with the leaders of the house and the senate and
[26:57.840 --> 27:03.040]  the president and saying in fact if you don't believe me what you showed you the huffington post
[27:03.920 --> 27:07.600]  and they're reporting it dryly oh new legislative body it's unconstitutional but so what
[27:08.240 --> 27:12.560]  president's a dictator we love it if we allow him to get away with it you see that's what dictators
[27:12.560 --> 27:18.400]  don't come out and say i'm a dictator martial law they say security we're gonna have more police
[27:18.400 --> 27:23.840]  out security military uh what i'm launching a security operation in libya i'm launching a security
[27:23.840 --> 27:31.600]  operation in poland or danzig or austria my name's my name's hitler they don't come out and say hey
[27:31.600 --> 27:36.240]  we're crooks we're taking over they come out and say well we've got a very dry convoluted and both
[27:36.240 --> 27:41.040]  sides compromise and both sides aren't happy but this will avert a collapse and we're going to work
[27:41.040 --> 27:46.080]  on it now and the cuts aren't even real and it's all that part's all a scam we're going to get into that
[27:46.080 --> 27:53.520]  carry reading all of them are publicly i'm gonna read their quotes licking their chops
[27:54.480 --> 27:59.840]  saying we can cover everything gun control borders debt banker bailouts so they're getting
[27:59.840 --> 28:06.560]  ready for the next looting the the original looting is ongoing but even more carbon taxes hey atf
[28:06.560 --> 28:10.080]  why do you think obama did something no president's ever done and said well i don't need a law just
[28:10.080 --> 28:15.680]  order the atf to put new laws and new regulations in over gun dealers to start harassing gun owners
[28:15.680 --> 28:21.680]  they're just doing it i've never seen anything near this magnitude here's cbs news last night
[28:21.680 --> 28:27.040]  right after it passes a summary of the debt ceiling and i'll show folks a document cam shot of this
[28:27.840 --> 28:32.000]  we're watching on prism planet dot tv a summary of the debt ceiling compromise
[28:32.880 --> 28:39.680]  then it goes on to say 269 161 174 traders republicans and 94 95 democrats and it goes on
[28:39.680 --> 28:46.400]  to dryly in the bottom of the article say the agreement creates a 12 person house and senate
[28:46.400 --> 28:51.120]  special committee oh it's very special to identify further spending cuts the committee
[28:51.120 --> 28:55.840]  must complete its work by thanksgiving of every 23rd oh really actually continues after that
[28:55.840 --> 29:00.560]  and congress must hold an up or down vote on committee recommendations oh it's a recommendation
[29:00.560 --> 29:06.480]  but you must vote it up or down but wait it gets worse the committee could overhaul the tax code
[29:06.480 --> 29:10.160]  which they're announcing they're going to increase taxes or find savings and benefit programs like
[29:10.160 --> 29:15.680]  medicare medicaid and social security savings means cuts congress could not modify the committee's
[29:15.680 --> 29:21.200]  recommendation oh you can't modify my recommendation it's like don corleone your signature your brains
[29:21.200 --> 29:26.320]  will be on the contract continuing now let here's the key now listen to this carefully this is cbs
[29:26.320 --> 29:32.880]  news listen to the magnitude of this should the special committee deadlock or should congress
[29:32.880 --> 29:38.160]  reject the committee's recommendations the automatic across the board spending cuts of at
[29:38.160 --> 29:43.120]  least 1.2 trillion would go into effect but the committee if you read the language decides the
[29:43.120 --> 29:52.160]  cuts so you do what we say or we do what we want period we're dictators we're on the march the

[33:28.880 --> 33:38.080]  bill where when you sell two or more rifles that the form has to be filled out a lengthy form on
[33:38.080 --> 33:42.960]  the person and sent to the atf even though they already have the national gun tracking center
[33:42.960 --> 33:46.960]  they already have the instant check you already have your background check runs at the fbi
[33:46.960 --> 33:53.040]  they already write down a handgun rifle shotgun they already know it's about setting the president

[34:02.560 --> 34:08.400]  that you have to do this and i talked to two different austin gun dealers and to someone in my
[34:08.400 --> 34:14.080]  office and one of them talked to the atf one of the gun dealers and we're going to larry pratt

[37:18.160 --> 37:23.600]  establishes a new system of government i've got his quotes here um he says this will allow unlimited
[37:23.600 --> 37:29.120]  tax increases no more filibusters no more amendments we are wide open it's like in
[37:29.120 --> 37:35.680]  star trek the shields are down we're just getting hit right now i mean this again i say i get chills
[37:35.680 --> 37:38.880]  i used to get chills once a year when something freaked me out i get them every five minutes
[37:38.880 --> 37:44.800]  now we're on air the hair on the back of my neck standing up total tyranny is being released
[37:45.680 --> 37:50.720]  i'm gonna try to be calm here but the senate just passed this if we don't have a constitution
[37:50.720 --> 37:56.000]  and bill writes we don't have anything every other country that has gone this way goes to
[37:56.000 --> 38:00.800]  hell in a hand basket larry proud i'm sorry to be getting emotional here but i am completely freaked
[38:00.800 --> 38:07.280]  out i i can tell when a guy's on a tear now this this is kind of like the council in play toe
[38:07.920 --> 38:12.560]  where they go out behind the bull rushes and decide in secret what's going to be done and then
[38:12.560 --> 38:18.800]  everybody else just kind of has to lump it when this thing comes forth when this super congress
[38:18.800 --> 38:23.920]  comes forth with some nutty idea which could easily have gun control along with tax increases
[38:24.480 --> 38:34.640]  and it goes to the president it would take 34 votes to sustain what what all is going on i mean
[38:34.640 --> 38:41.920]  they've they've really set it up so you almost can't stop one blessed thing we need to vote
[38:41.920 --> 38:50.400]  against so many people starting in the primaries next year so many need to go i sure hope people
[38:51.200 --> 39:00.480]  like ron johnson of uh of uh wisconsin a plastics manufacturer he just got so fed up with what was
[39:00.480 --> 39:06.720]  going on that he uh got talked into running actually he became a tea party favorite in the
[39:06.720 --> 39:12.400]  state speaking to a number of places and that kind of built up his popularity we need people like
[39:12.400 --> 39:20.800]  that to come out of the comfort of our homes and to stand for office we allow a super congress to
[39:20.800 --> 39:26.480]  be set and and and they kind of blandly go along and train us to accept it they can start shutting
[39:26.480 --> 39:30.800]  off more and more true power of the house and senate and that's what this does i mean this
[39:30.800 --> 39:35.840]  absolutely have you ever seen anything like this larry that that's why the first act of the next
[39:35.840 --> 39:41.600]  congress hopefully is going to be to repeal this horrible piece of legislation which threatens
[39:41.600 --> 39:46.640]  everybody's agenda not just gun owners but they can do terrible things to property owners to
[39:46.640 --> 39:54.320]  taxpayers businesses this is it is a game changer they have decided that we don't need the
[39:54.320 --> 40:02.240]  house of representatives to originate revenue bills we'll just have the the super 12 do that
[40:02.240 --> 40:07.680]  and as you said the council of 13 really with the president thrown in for bad measure so
[40:08.560 --> 40:14.560]  oh my god it's just an extraordinary thing and there were some i i think some fairly
[40:15.600 --> 40:21.600]  well intended people that just got flummoxed but there were some that knew exactly what they're
[40:21.600 --> 40:28.160]  doing and i would include in that john bainer and the senate minority leader mr mcconnell
[40:28.160 --> 40:33.680]  and of course harry reid knew very well what he was doing oh yeah mitch mcconnell two weeks ago
[40:33.680 --> 40:38.960]  proposed just giving the power of the purse to obama that's not his power to give right i mean
[40:38.960 --> 40:45.680]  speaking for all i mean he can't do that i mean larry pratt is this not classical treason i mean
[40:45.680 --> 40:52.480]  this is changing the form of our government well we had to change the form of the government
[40:52.480 --> 41:00.240]  because we can't stop spending like drunks locked inside the liquor store oh man this they they
[41:00.240 --> 41:07.600]  refuse to deal with the problem and so they create another totally different humongous problem and
[41:07.600 --> 41:14.400]  meanwhile the cuts for this year are going to be less than two days expenditure oh i've gone to the
[41:14.400 --> 41:19.280]  numbers most of it's in the next 10 years and they never do that and that's what we call here
[41:19.280 --> 41:26.000]  fairy dust it doesn't exist it's not going to happen it's like it's like the easter bunny well
[41:26.640 --> 41:31.840]  larry pratt i mean listen this is all been done by design we have the the 10 governors now speaking
[41:31.840 --> 41:36.480]  for the states the governor's council we have the rural affairs run by the defense department
[41:36.480 --> 41:41.520]  and homeland security uh we have you heard me earlier as i introed you we have the atf
[41:42.160 --> 41:45.520]  coming out and saying well we're just going to order you to do things because we couldn't get
[41:45.520 --> 41:51.760]  this law passed and they and they actually call them demand letters we're demanding that you give
[41:51.760 --> 41:58.560]  us the information and if the dealer doesn't well they they've had his neck in a noose ever
[41:58.560 --> 42:03.760]  since he got his license and they can pull that license but that's my point larry i've never seen
[42:03.760 --> 42:09.600]  such a bum rush of tyranny on every front they're just doing whatever they want i think they really
[42:09.600 --> 42:14.400]  are going for dictatorship and i don't mean a dictatorship of obama you know he'll leave probably
[42:14.400 --> 42:19.680]  but a dictatorship of the bureaucracy and the special interest i mean are you have you ever
[42:19.680 --> 42:25.440]  seen anything this this off the chart well like that family that i guess it was actually the kid
[42:25.440 --> 42:30.800]  that was raising a lot of bunnies and they faced a monster fine from the department of agriculture
[42:30.800 --> 42:34.960]  because they didn't have the department's permission there shouldn't be a department of
[42:34.960 --> 42:40.720]  agriculture where's that in the constitution finding a little boy millions of dollars because
[42:40.720 --> 42:48.000]  uh right he had rabbits breeding like well rabbits well but but being larry i mean i'm asking you
[42:48.000 --> 42:56.560]  have you ever seen such a brazen move how would you describe this council of 13 um this is something
[42:56.560 --> 43:03.680]  that even fdr wouldn't have thought he could gotten away with this is this is such a brazen
[43:03.680 --> 43:12.160]  strike at our liberty that uh and you know that uh bainer and mcconnell are going to appoint wooses
[43:12.800 --> 43:18.400]  so it's not going to be uh you know michelle bachman uh as one of the house representatives
[43:18.400 --> 43:24.560]  if you know a bitter ender that is it is against all this uh wild spending they're going to put
[43:24.560 --> 43:29.600]  reasonable people on there and these reasonable people will be the ones that continue to lead us
[43:29.600 --> 43:35.680]  into dictatorship well they don't have the power it's not in our constitution to create a super
[43:35.680 --> 43:41.920]  congress and say we will originate the legislation from the top i mean this is classic tyranny
[43:41.920 --> 43:49.840]  this is a larger version of court site where the police chief uh fires the mayor when he can't
[43:49.840 --> 43:56.960]  and fires 80 of the cops and they don't go along with it uh this is a microcosm of of of of of of
[43:56.960 --> 44:02.800]  these men up there transferring more power to themselves uh with obama and the white house
[44:02.800 --> 44:09.200]  is pleased as punch uh larry we're seeing an acceleration here and and and you know disagree
[44:09.200 --> 44:15.120]  if you disagree but uh we're seeing a massive acceleration week to week it gets crazier who
[44:15.120 --> 44:19.600]  would have ever thought corrupt government-run health care with the president's buddies exempt
[44:19.600 --> 44:23.840]  who would have ever thought atf telling gun shops to do things and aren't the law uh who would have
[44:23.840 --> 44:27.360]  ever thought the atf shipment guns to mexico to blame the second amendment who would have ever
[44:27.360 --> 44:34.160]  thought wars in libya with al qaeda now recognized as at the u.s. embassy as the official government
[44:34.160 --> 44:39.760]  literal admitted real al qaeda who would have ever thought that we'd see all of this i mean
[44:39.760 --> 44:44.480]  we're living in the twilight zone we got chickens coming home to roost we've had the school's
[44:44.480 --> 44:50.800]  teaching us for years and years that we live in a democracy well if people think that way
[44:50.800 --> 44:56.480]  then the assumption is when i win an election i can do anything i want because i won and i got the
[44:56.480 --> 45:02.720]  votes that's not the way it works in a republic and people don't understand that there are barrier
[45:02.720 --> 45:08.080]  limits that's what the constitution's all about it is not alive it is not breathing it is there
[45:08.080 --> 45:12.720]  to chain you down when you work for me in the government well larry here's my question to you
[45:12.720 --> 45:22.720]  you this is the big issue and we how did we end up with a vote with the majority of the republicans
[45:22.720 --> 45:30.160]  here voting for this it was a majority of republicans i think i'm looking for the vote count here
[45:30.160 --> 45:37.520]  i'll pull up in a minute uh who went for this it was only about 69 that opposed it and uh since
[45:37.520 --> 45:44.480]  there's what 240 could retake republicans that means a humongous number went for it and a pretty
[45:44.480 --> 45:49.520]  substantial part of the dems went for it as well and the ones that didn't were believed in their own
[45:49.520 --> 45:57.600]  left-wing propaganda that somehow um they were getting uh thrashed well they'll take a deep breath
[45:57.600 --> 46:04.000]  one of these days and realize hey we just pulled off a coup d'etat not bad but this proves continuity
[46:04.000 --> 46:09.200]  of agenda bush would the banker bail out obama continues it i mean i mean they just they just
[46:10.240 --> 46:15.200]  continue on where the other one left off they're part of the ruling class and yeah there's a republican
[46:15.200 --> 46:21.280]  group of the ruling class and a democrat part and there are some differences but uh by and large
[46:21.280 --> 46:25.280]  except for the some of the newbies then and and people have been around for a while like
[46:25.280 --> 46:33.280]  bachman and steve king uh we you only got about 65 or so members of the house of representatives
[46:33.280 --> 46:38.960]  that have any idea what a republic means what a vote needs to look like if it's going to be a
[46:38.960 --> 46:46.080]  constitutional vote and the rest of the 435 members that congress apparently don't have a clue we're
[46:46.080 --> 46:52.400]  talking about well there would be a few senators in there too maybe less than 20 percent uh and
[46:52.400 --> 46:57.360]  there all the rest of some 80 percent are clueless they think they can do whatever they want well i
[46:57.360 --> 47:04.080]  think we need to have some political reprisals on these people i mean we need to be talking about
[47:04.080 --> 47:11.040]  see you in november well i agree and i'm here to tell you anyone that voted for this is either an
[47:11.040 --> 47:16.800]  absolute criminal trader or doesn't know how to boil water doesn't know how to tie their shoelaces
[47:16.800 --> 47:23.600]  and so the 174 republicans that voted for this absolutely must be removed the 95 democrats
[47:23.600 --> 47:30.880]  absolutely must be removed the vote 174 republicans 95 democrats for anybody and it was mainly tea party
[47:30.880 --> 47:35.920]  people that voted against it on the republican side uh and we have a new york times at a
[47:35.920 --> 47:41.280]  toil today that and i'm going to read it later that actually says the tea party are terrorist
[47:41.280 --> 47:46.480]  they're the new terrorist go after them or you know basically arrest them alex that's serious
[47:46.480 --> 47:52.080]  because when when we start seeing language like that used what is the proper thing to do to a
[47:52.080 --> 47:59.440]  terrorist well to kill him so they're using the kind of words that hitler and linon and eamine
[47:59.440 --> 48:05.520]  and paul pot were using they're doing what elinsky teaches they are they're particularizing
[48:05.520 --> 48:12.160]  personalizing and marginalizing so that the enemy is really an enemy and he needs to be
[48:12.160 --> 48:18.560]  liquidated exterminated just like dictators have done everywhere absolutely they're selling the idea
[48:18.560 --> 48:23.760]  in the new york times and i'm going to read the quote here in a moment that anybody who actually
[48:23.760 --> 48:28.240]  wants to cut government ought to the federal reserve as a terrorist uh here it is out of the
[48:28.240 --> 48:35.120]  new york uh times it says can't we do this right thomas l freeman and here's the quote alas at the
[48:35.120 --> 48:42.240]  tea party it is so lacking in any aspiration for american greatness oh yeah so dominated by the
[48:42.240 --> 48:47.680]  narrowest visions of our country and so ignorant of the fact that it was not tax cuts that made
[48:47.680 --> 48:52.240]  america great oh really that's what was fought over but our unique public private partnerships
[48:52.240 --> 48:59.920]  home across the generations if same republicans do not stand up to the hezbollah faction in their
[48:59.920 --> 49:06.160]  midst the tea party will take the gop on the suicide mission no american political uh
[49:06.160 --> 49:11.840]  politician was more allergic to debt or taxes than thomas jefferson but he also and it goes on from
[49:11.840 --> 49:18.800]  there but listen uh here's the bad news debt bill passes senate headed to obama uh unsure of triple
[49:18.800 --> 49:24.960]  a usa credit rating will suffer from the spectacle so so so the idea is anybody that doesn't want
[49:24.960 --> 49:29.680]  to increase taxes and go deeper into debt you're the ones hurting america not the people that did
[49:29.680 --> 49:35.600]  this larry in a sense i guess we are terrorists by that very article that you were reading you can
[49:35.600 --> 49:43.360]  tell he is terrorized it terrorizes the status to think that we might take some other power away
[49:43.360 --> 49:49.120]  and put them into the constitutional box they were intended to stay within that does bring
[49:49.120 --> 49:54.960]  terror to them now they can't think of living by producing anything they have to live by taking
[49:54.960 --> 50:00.800]  from all the rest of us and you know i think the rest of us are just about finished being taken
[50:00.800 --> 50:06.560]  without it well well that is a good point at the end of the day that we are really getting
[50:06.560 --> 50:11.120]  a front row seat to total corruption and tyranny and the wakeups only accelerating larry i drive
[50:11.120 --> 50:15.680]  around austin i see info wars dot com stickers everywhere but not just that not just ron paul
[50:15.680 --> 50:21.360]  stickers everywhere i see huge things on the sides of nice cars uh you know junky cars you name it
[50:21.360 --> 50:27.680]  legalize the constitution you know arrest the politicians folks are angry yes and we i think
[50:27.680 --> 50:34.480]  we're going to stay angry i think it was not just the town halls that got us to a point where we had
[50:34.480 --> 50:40.240]  to deal with our elected officials but wisconsin i think was something that stirred the whole country
[50:40.240 --> 50:46.080]  this thing now i believe is going to continue our agitation yeah we're going to stay angry stay there
[50:46.080 --> 50:54.080]  larry pratt only one more segment on the raft of anti gun legislation that is waiting that now
[50:54.080 --> 50:59.920]  can pass without amendment or without filibuster the big attacks coming folks stay with us

[55:41.440 --> 55:46.800]  people that haven't been adjudicated of anything this is a law enforcement tool but now they're
[55:46.800 --> 55:51.280]  saying well that's enough to deny somebody their right to keep and bear arms and there are bills
[55:51.280 --> 55:56.720]  that have been discussed to do just that frank lautenberg the gun grabber from new jersey and the
[55:56.720 --> 56:03.840]  u.s senate uh is a a longtime supporter of this kind of thing and this is the very kind of thing

[56:11.680 --> 56:17.840]  we going to do about it we can't amend it we need a super majority like passing a treaty to overturn

[56:24.960 --> 56:29.920]  about this your professional the head of a you know you know huge patriotic organization but
[56:29.920 --> 56:34.560]  i mean at a certain point layer we got to start jumping up and down i mean you've got ramen manual

[56:59.280 --> 57:04.880]  the elinsky notion that you never let a good crisis go to waste and how did they get this passed
[57:04.880 --> 57:09.840]  well they had us all breathless that the country if we didn't have something happening by today
[57:09.840 --> 57:18.720]  was going to default that was a lie and they continued to use it even after members of congress
[57:18.720 --> 57:25.440]  explained many times no we don't default we do bring in 60 percent of what we're spending and
[57:25.440 --> 57:30.720]  that's more than enough to pay for this stupid interest that we keep racking up with the other
[57:30.720 --> 57:39.040]  40 percent they would not refrain from using the word and they stampeded i think a lot of the members
[57:39.040 --> 57:43.680]  of the congress into this well we got to do something well why don't you just put a gun to

[01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:35.680]  the tea party lost big time and some of the tea party congressmen were so traitorous or so dumb
[01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:40.960]  i guess because uh you know they're uh mom and dad or brother and sisters or whatever
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:46.480]  the issue here is this is absolute tyranny you just heard larry prappett that's how the

[01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:34.160]  they're all reporting just in case you're doubting this we've also reported on as well before
[01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:40.960]  they even passed it that the super congress the council of 13 six house six senate and the president
[01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:48.640]  who's the uh veto power overlord he's in this blasphemous 13 he's the messiah and they're the
[01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:55.520]  disciples he's sort on or the emperor and they're his little Darth vaders they originate legislation
[01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:59.520]  remember you watch school time rock how the bill gets introduced by the house member and debated
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:04.720]  and looked at uh-uh we don't need any stinking lower house members or senators we've got the
[01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:10.800]  council of 13 like a science fiction book if i'd have written a science fiction book 20 years ago
[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:17.680]  about in 2011 a council of 13 ruled and and no one cared or understood how big a deal it was
[01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:22.080]  i mean that's the thing they're like oh yeah there's a new system of government
[01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:26.560]  even the huffington post says that it's pretty good president actually has veto power over
[01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:33.840]  everything now and uh yeah it's kind of fun and uh now the bills originate uh in the in the in the
[01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:40.720]  council and uh then the house and senate are given up or down votes but if they don't vote for it
[01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:47.600]  if they vote no then the council does what it wants so the council says here i mean that's like
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:54.000]  going into restaurant and everything on the menu is is is fly soup you say i don't want fly soup
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:58.320]  what else they go well sir there's fly soup as you can see there's 27 listings here of fly soup
[01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:05.200]  what do you got to drink uh we have uh rancid tap water and then we have rancid tap water
[01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:09.280]  they're like what you're and then they look at us like we're crazy you're saying there aren't choices
[01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:14.240]  here sir there are 27 listings of fly soup you're like but how is it different different types of
[01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:21.840]  flies in the suit they're like no but it's listed repeatedly so you pass what we bring you i just
[01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:28.480]  read it last hour twice from cbs news and the text of it i can't believe this the magnitude of this
[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:33.920]  i mean this is such a joke if it wasn't so serious uh you you pass what we give you
[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:40.000]  and harriet says it's for guns taxes everything it's everything now not just spending that's
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:44.000]  what the public was told see this all much to do about nothing about getting an agreement
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:49.520]  last minute was about ramming this through and again it'll just fade off into the distance
[01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:55.760]  and all the council of 12 you know with the 13th leader the council of 13 it said this it did that
[01:10:56.720 --> 01:11:00.720]  and it's in the clatchy newspapers it's in all the articles they're saying wow
[01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:07.360]  here's one fiscal conservatives barred from super committee so now they're debating people
[01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:14.240]  are jockeying who gets to get on the committee uh uh uh the committee oh there's there's 13 presidents
[01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:21.200]  now there's a council of elders uh i mean yes we have lived to see it and
[01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:29.120]  well here's one read vows to raise taxes and the l president they set to give a speech in a moment
[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:33.760]  it'll be about the victory for america and we came together and not everybody got what they wanted
[01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:38.320]  by the way the cuts don't even exist down the road don't worry they're gonna cut yourself
[01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:42.720]  to security another step but they're really cutting them by inflation which they never talk about
[01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:54.320]  or the dollar devaluation evidenced by the dollar going down in gold at $1,642.70 last time i checked
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:12:00.960]  us borrowing to surge after debt cap raised 2.4 trillion would be largest debt limit increase
[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:06.320]  in us history they're just getting us started they've already signed us on to 1.5 quadrille
[01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:14.720]  1.5 quadrillion well oh lord obama speaking here let's fade up a little bit of our of our lord

[01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:40.480]  of course if he suddenly was put under a truth you know system some ray beam hitting to make him
[01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:45.680]  tell the truth he would say we are transferring the last of your jobs the general electric council

[01:12:55.120 --> 01:13:00.000]  europe we're totally raping you we've devalued most of the dollar and never get rid of the rest
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:06.000]  of the value i'm coming after your guns outside of law i ship weapons to mexico i've bankrupted
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:11.040]  the entire economy by design the health care plan was written by the hmo's to rob you and lower
[01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:16.000]  your standard of care and take the power to make decisions away from doctors i'm an absolute 21st
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:22.000]  century tyrant pimp reading off a teleprompter but instead america's doing good and i'm gonna get
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:28.480]  you some jobs and in bush hey i promise i we're not listening to you without wiretaps
[01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:33.440]  hey of course things will be a heck of a lot easier this is dictatorship just so long as i'm
[01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:40.960]  a dictator hey hey i mean it is such a joke all right i want to go to your calls but again
[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:45.840]  governors of america says this will affect guns harry reid says you bet your bottom dollar and now
[01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:51.200]  you can't filibuster you can't add amendments you can't block diddly squad and they're saying
[01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:56.240]  you know what said it two weeks ago presidents could start doing stuff without congress he already
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:14:02.560]  started but we're gonna put you on that no fly list for no buy list you gotta go buy a gun you
[01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:08.480]  can't find out why you got on the list there's a new sheriff in town it's called new world order
[01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:15.920]  it's called banker takeover and then he got that slimebag mitch mcconnell who who proposed all this
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:21.520]  garbage uh a couple weeks ago said just give the power of the purse to obama as if he has the
[01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:26.240]  power to do that i forget the other nine senators i say we just give it to obama
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:32.880]  and then he told this was a victory for the tea party yeah like getting a hole in your head is a
[01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:38.320]  victory for i mean this is just insane i wanted to briefly bring ted anerson out then we'll go to
[01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:47.120]  marcos or marcus brian connie jenny ryan and others but ted anerson just briefly your take
[01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:52.400]  on all this and then i want to tell folks about buying silver and gold you know three months ago
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:56.320]  they drove it down artificially you bought them dragons horde of gold and silver and put it in
[01:14:56.320 --> 01:15:02.480]  your local bank vault and as that sold out as it went up you kept buying it as much as you could
[01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:07.280]  get and so you do have it when it was lower just not like it was three months ago in gold and silver
[01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:10.960]  and it's going to keep going up but folks can get the time machine and go back to a few months ago
[01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:16.720]  uh and still get good deals on gold and silver and i hope people take advantage of that at the
[01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:21.360]  end of the day or they can just let the globalists devalue their dollars but ted what's your view on
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:27.760]  this whole situation well hey i mean the way you described it and it's just so crazy it's not even
[01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:32.960]  funny i mean now i mean they're at least admitting like for instance bloomberg has a report out right
[01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:37.920]  now that says that the uh debt agreement puts the us on the path to the end of stimulation just as
[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:43.600]  the economy falters uh you know what it doesn't matter they pass the debt of debt stimulation
[01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:48.160]  it's going to devaluate the currency they don't pass the debt to simulation uh stimulation it's
[01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:52.640]  going to make mean that's moody's and standard and pours is going to downgrade our bonds i mean it
[01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:58.720]  just it doesn't matter we've reached the end of our rope here economically we've gone way too far
[01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:04.320]  into debt we've destroyed our currency we've handed off the power to the banking system
[01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:10.320]  it's just a sad friend who went into for minor surgery and got an infection came out of the
[01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:16.400]  hospital a week later all his organs started failing and his dad lives in dallas uh you know grew up
[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:23.120]  next door to him his dad lived in dallas and was racing down here and his body was paralyzed
[01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:29.920]  but he was awake and they were pumping full of at the hospital speed and uh or whatever they said
[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:35.120]  was to keep him awake just so a family could get there and they were pumping full of adrenaline
[01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:39.120]  and his eyes and they'd shoot him up with it and he'd open up and he couldn't talk and he was just
[01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:43.520]  looking at me he was conscious and then right as his dad got there they were they were shooting up
[01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:48.000]  with more because they were saying he's dead so they were saying he's dead already and then i watched him
[01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:53.440]  they gave him more but they said they said his arteries have all collapsed
[01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:59.200]  you know the stuff isn't working anymore he'll be dead very soon and they had him on a respirator
[01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:04.560]  imagine he's conscious with the with the with the respirator like darth vader and that's america
[01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:10.080]  and and and the bankers uh are are just keeping us alive while they get their money offshore
[01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:14.560]  i'm sorry ted go ahead yeah it's like you're describing our economy as sad as that story
[01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:19.120]  is that your friend had to die that way but that's what's going on in the united states economy
[01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:24.160]  and uh and that's what they're doing and they're injecting uh insulin into the economy trying to
[01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:29.440]  bolster it get it back going again and it isn't working and uh so what do we have here today on
[01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:34.080]  gold i mean that's the that's the key factor see yeah that's a live boat with the sinking ship
[01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:38.800]  and you've got the best deals out there it's why you've grown from nowhere in the last few decades
[01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:42.960]  to now what the fifth largest gold and silver broker ted give folks the offers i'm gonna come

[01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:50.880]  on the air hi alex how you doing good hey my he sort of answered my question earlier but i want
[01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:56.240]  you to elaborate on it and it was i was had been one to call you for a couple of days and about
[01:24:56.240 --> 01:25:02.800]  obama you know when is when it comes time for election until just you know stay in power no
[01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:09.840]  longer the president sir he is the he is the 13th member of the council the supreme council of the
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:16.560]  dear leaders exactly i remember the end of clinton's second term there was talk of hit
[01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:22.480]  talk of him not stepping down so we know why there was always talk because under the executive orders
[01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:27.760]  and go read them i mean it's mainstream news now finally getting attention under pdds they have
[01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:33.360]  already made themselves dictators that's why congress probably did this because in pdd 51 and
[01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:38.800]  the other one i read yesterday what is it homeland security directive 20 it openly states there in
[01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:45.840]  fact i'll repull it and read it the next segment it openly states that he can take over all power
[01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:50.400]  of congress for six months during any emergency including economic so it's already happened
[01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:55.120]  but you but again it's not legitimate because the president just can't sign orders making
[01:25:55.120 --> 01:26:02.000]  himself king yeah i understand that but i i think he can do it i think he could pull it off
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:05.680]  unfortunately yeah well there have you noticed suddenly they're all saying the tea partyers
[01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:13.520]  are hezbollah and are al-qaeda you've got Pelosi you got reed you got uh uh biden all saying it new
[01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:17.920]  york times i mean they meet folks they're gonna blow stuff up and blame it on us i mean just get
[01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:23.040]  ready for it just like they ship guns into mexico these are terrorist hardcore terrorist and if
[01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:27.440]  folks don't grow up and admit it it's over it's game over marcus we either as a country grow up
[01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:32.000]  and go my gosh we got a bunch of hitlers up there mixed with a bunch of stylings and mouths
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:38.720]  and fidel castros and a little chavez on top then then it's over we either grow up repent and and
[01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:42.400]  realize we're in deep trouble or it's over and people say well why did they leave you on air

[01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:03.200]  my mind that they're actually getting away with stuff like that no people don't realize all the

[01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:27.920]  kids and i'm scared to death of what's going to happen to them and what their future is going to hold
[01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:33.760]  you know i i i just can't believe this stuff is going on you know people all all they have to do is
[01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:39.520]  look at here's the deal we ain't seen nothing yet there's these periods in history where more
[01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:44.400]  happens in a few years that happened in the last hundred we're we're not even to that yet we're just
[01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:51.200]  approaching the event horizon of the orgy of mass murder and death they've got the helicopters loaded

[01:30:04.400 --> 01:30:10.640]  last century alone this is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda

[01:32:04.480 --> 01:32:08.800]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:13.920]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:19.440]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[01:32:19.440 --> 01:32:25.200]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now
[01:32:25.200 --> 01:32:30.720]  new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[01:32:30.720 --> 01:32:35.120]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:40.960]  onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks
[01:32:40.960 --> 01:32:44.720]  i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science one of my
[01:32:44.720 --> 01:32:50.720]  oldest sponsors you can get more information at www dot my solar backup dot com that's my solar
[01:32:50.720 --> 01:32:55.840]  backup dot com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to my solar backup dot com
[01:32:55.840 --> 01:33:12.320]  or call 1-877-327-0365
[01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:36.320]  ah
[01:33:36.320 --> 01:33:40.320]  Wrapped up in silent sauce, circuits are dead
[01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:46.320]  Can I decode my whole life's brains into a frenzy?
[01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:52.320]  And my step into the twilight zone
[01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:54.320]  Ladies and gentlemen
[01:33:54.320 --> 01:33:57.320]  Jenny, Ryan, Earl, Kathy, Chris, others
[01:33:57.320 --> 01:33:58.320]  We're going to be getting to your calls
[01:33:58.320 --> 01:34:01.320]  While Pastor Chuck Baldwin is on with us
[01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:05.320]  Of course presidential candidate in the Constitution Party
[01:34:05.320 --> 01:34:07.320]  Unfortunately everything he's been warning about
[01:34:07.320 --> 01:34:10.320]  And pointing out is now unfolding
[01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:12.320]  And it's just going to get worse from here
[01:34:12.320 --> 01:34:15.320]  We've begun now the slide down the slippery slope
[01:34:15.320 --> 01:34:18.320]  And it's just going to get faster and faster and faster
[01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:20.320]  The level of tyranny you will live under
[01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:22.320]  Is exactly the amount you'll put up with
[01:34:22.320 --> 01:34:25.320]  Even if you had angels in government and didn't restrain them
[01:34:25.320 --> 01:34:28.320]  Evil people would struggle to get into those positions
[01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:31.320]  Because that's where the real power and wealth comes from
[01:34:31.320 --> 01:34:33.320]  In a corrupt system
[01:34:33.320 --> 01:34:35.320]  And we're going to be talking about the Council of Thirteen
[01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:37.320]  All of these incredible developments in your calls
[01:34:37.320 --> 01:34:40.320]  The reason I got the pastor on is he's got a new book coming out
[01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:42.320]  Dealing with something that Hitler used
[01:34:42.320 --> 01:34:45.320]  Something that the Soviets used, the Maoists used
[01:34:45.320 --> 01:34:48.320]  Something now taught through the World Council of Churches
[01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:50.320]  Through the clergy response teams
[01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:53.320]  And that is that do whatever government says
[01:34:53.320 --> 01:34:55.320]  If they tell you to line children up and shoot them in the head
[01:34:55.320 --> 01:34:56.320]  Do it, it's of the Lord
[01:34:56.320 --> 01:34:59.320]  Because government is put there by God to gang rape you
[01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:01.320]  And of course that's the opposite
[01:35:01.320 --> 01:35:04.320]  Look at all the disciples and people being killed
[01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:06.320]  For not doing what Caesar said
[01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:08.320]  Or what the Pharisees said
[01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:10.320]  Look at all the different prophets
[01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:11.320]  Look at Jesus
[01:35:11.320 --> 01:35:15.320]  I mean, I guess he should have bowed down to Pilate
[01:35:15.320 --> 01:35:16.320]  But he didn't
[01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:18.320]  But see, they don't want you reading that
[01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:19.320]  And I played the news clips
[01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:21.320]  In fact, for later, you can go to YouTube
[01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:25.320]  And just type in clergy response team
[01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:27.320]  And it's a newscast saying
[01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:30.320]  We're teaching people of the Lord to hand their guns in
[01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:32.320]  That's coming up in just a moment
[01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:35.320]  Also, remember, we're funded by your support here

[01:35:49.320 --> 01:35:52.320]  And it's a variant of the coiled snake
[01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:54.320]  And people just absolutely love it
[01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:55.320]  Very handsome shirt
[01:35:55.320 --> 01:35:57.320]  I get a lot of comments on the word out in public
[01:35:57.320 --> 01:35:58.320]  And it gets the word out
[01:35:58.320 --> 01:36:00.320]  At infowars.com in the back
[01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:02.320]  You want to meet a lot of like-minded people

[01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:08.320]  And Reed and others are calling anybody
[01:36:08.320 --> 01:36:11.320]  That's for liberty or tea party or a terrorist
[01:36:11.320 --> 01:36:13.320]  That's all over the news today
[01:36:13.320 --> 01:36:15.320]  So again, that's available at infowars.com

[01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:08.320]  Now, going to Chuck Baldwin
[01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:11.320]  I can't think of a more perfect time to have him on
[01:37:11.320 --> 01:37:15.320]  Because we carry his sometimes multiple weekly columns
[01:37:15.320 --> 01:37:19.320]  Very well researched, great work that he does
[01:37:19.320 --> 01:37:21.320]  And we're obviously going to get into his new book
[01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:22.320]  But I want to get into Super Congress
[01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:25.320]  To target the Second Amendment according to Larry Pratt
[01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:29.320]  The bills now will originate out of the Super Congress
[01:37:29.320 --> 01:37:32.320]  And there's no filibustering or amendments
[01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:35.320]  And then if the Congress doesn't do, doesn't vote yes
[01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:37.320]  On their bill, then the Super Congress
[01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:39.320]  On spending bills implements it themselves
[01:37:39.320 --> 01:37:41.320]  So it's a dictatorship over the purse
[01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:45.320]  Between 12 members of the House and Senate
[01:37:45.320 --> 01:37:48.320]  And, of course, the 13th commander
[01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:53.320]  Emperor, the council of 13th chairman, the dear leader, Obama
[01:37:53.320 --> 01:37:55.320]  But going, again, to Chuck Baldwin
[01:37:55.320 --> 01:37:58.320]  Author, radio talk show host, pastor, columnist
[01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:04.320]  And, of course, he has ChuckBaldwinlive.com
[01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:06.320]  And he was the presidential candidate
[01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:09.320]  And got a lot of attention, got a lot of good work done
[01:38:09.320 --> 01:38:14.320]  For the Constitution Party back during the last presidential round
[01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:16.320]  And he joins us now to break down all the different things
[01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:19.320]  That are unfolding and taking place
[01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:22.320]  The new book is Romans 13, The True Meaning of Submission
[01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:25.320]  Pastor, good to have you here with us
[01:38:25.320 --> 01:38:27.320]  Alex, great to be with you again, thank you very much
[01:38:27.320 --> 01:38:30.320]  Well, so much has happened, so much is going on
[01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:33.320]  But out of the gates before we get into Romans 13
[01:38:33.320 --> 01:38:36.320]  Give us your view and your breakdown
[01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:38.320]  Of this new Super Congress
[01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:41.320]  Yeah, well, Larry Pratt does Yeoman's work
[01:38:41.320 --> 01:38:43.320]  In keeping the American people informed
[01:38:43.320 --> 01:38:46.320]  On what's going on relative to Second Amendment issues
[01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:50.320]  And I know your audience is a pretty intelligent audience
[01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:52.320]  Because they listen to you every day
[01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:54.320]  And the information you share
[01:38:54.320 --> 01:38:56.320]  But anything that Larry Pratt puts out
[01:38:56.320 --> 01:38:59.320]  People need to pay attention to, that's the bottom line
[01:38:59.320 --> 01:39:02.320]  Unlike some of the other organizations
[01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:04.320]  That say they're looking out for the Second Amendment
[01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:07.320]  The Gones of America and Larry Pratt are really doing it
[01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:10.320]  And whenever Larry broke this story
[01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:12.320]  I just shook my head and said, you know, this is stuff
[01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:14.320]  That we've been talking about for a long time
[01:39:14.320 --> 01:39:16.320]  And now here it is in reality
[01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:18.320]  Pastor, do me a favor, I can hear you pretty clear
[01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:20.320]  But you're a little muffled
[01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:22.320]  Will you get right into that microphone on your phone?
[01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:24.320]  All right, how's that?
[01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:26.320]  That is absolutely beautiful
[01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:30.320]  Please continue with your breakdown
[01:39:30.320 --> 01:39:33.320]  Yeah, I was just saying that Larry Pratt
[01:39:33.320 --> 01:39:36.320]  Is the one man that really truly looks out for
[01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:38.320]  The Second Amendment issues in America
[01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:40.320]  And as you know, you have him on many times
[01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:43.320]  When he first broke that story
[01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:47.320]  I shook my head and said, you know, this is the stuff
[01:39:47.320 --> 01:39:49.320]  That we've been talking about
[01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:51.320]  This is the stuff that you've been talking about for a long time
[01:39:51.320 --> 01:39:53.320]  And now here it is in fruition
[01:39:53.320 --> 01:39:55.320]  Just like the debt ceiling debacle
[01:39:55.320 --> 01:39:57.320]  I mean, you predicted it, I predicted it
[01:39:57.320 --> 01:40:00.320]  I mean, a lot of people, this is an old brainer
[01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:02.320]  We knew this was going to happen
[01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:04.320]  Republicans and Democrats alike
[01:40:04.320 --> 01:40:07.320]  They will not do what is necessary
[01:40:07.320 --> 01:40:10.320]  To discipline themselves to the Constitution
[01:40:10.320 --> 01:40:12.320]  Of the United States
[01:40:12.320 --> 01:40:15.320]  This is the debacle of the highest order
[01:40:15.320 --> 01:40:18.320]  And everything that we've been talking about
[01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:20.320]  For the last several years, I was in two way
[01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:22.320]  When I was running around the country
[01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:25.320]  And trying to get the message out after Ron Paul
[01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:28.320]  Dropped out of the race
[01:40:28.320 --> 01:40:30.320]  And now here we are again in 2012
[01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:32.320]  And the things that we were talking about then
[01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:36.320]  Have now come to fruition
[01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:39.320]  You're right, it is now coming to fruition
[01:40:39.320 --> 01:40:41.320]  I want to get into Romans 13
[01:40:41.320 --> 01:40:44.320]  And this attitude of rolling over to government
[01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:47.320]  But I mean, it's so arrogant
[01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:48.320]  I mean, so over the top
[01:40:48.320 --> 01:40:50.320]  And then there's not even a bigger fanfare
[01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:52.320]  Because it's all technical and lawyer-y
[01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:54.320]  And in fine print, Chuck
[01:40:54.320 --> 01:40:58.320]  But to say, oh, the bills will now
[01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:00.320]  Originate out of a council
[01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:02.320]  And then you can vote it up or down
[01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:04.320]  But if you don't vote for it then
[01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:06.320]  You can automatically do this
[01:41:06.320 --> 01:41:08.320]  And I mean, this is bizarre
[01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:10.320]  Well, they're setting us up
[01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:13.320]  For this continuity of government
[01:41:13.320 --> 01:41:16.320]  I've been writing on this for several years
[01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:18.320]  I know you've been talking about it
[01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:20.320]  The COG has been around since the 1990s
[01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:22.320]  When Clinton was president
[01:41:22.320 --> 01:41:25.320]  It was intensified whenever Bush 2
[01:41:25.320 --> 01:41:27.320]  Was in office
[01:41:27.320 --> 01:41:29.320]  And this is just the continuation
[01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:31.320]  And then the council of governors
[01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:33.320]  We wrote about that
[01:41:33.320 --> 01:41:34.320]  On the website
[01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:36.320]  And you see that America is broken down
[01:41:36.320 --> 01:41:38.320]  Into 10 regions
[01:41:38.320 --> 01:41:40.320]  They no longer even recognized America
[01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:42.320]  As being 50 states
[01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:44.320]  It's now 10 regions
[01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:46.320]  And the council of governors, the COG
[01:41:46.320 --> 01:41:48.320]  All this stuff has been going on
[01:41:48.320 --> 01:41:50.320]  At least since the 1990s
[01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:52.320]  But now what we're doing is
[01:41:52.320 --> 01:41:54.320]  We're seeing that this is now coming to fruition
[01:41:54.320 --> 01:41:57.320]  They're taking the blueprints
[01:41:57.320 --> 01:41:59.320]  That they've had in place
[01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:01.320]  For nearly 20 years
[01:42:01.320 --> 01:42:03.320]  And they are now beginning to implement it
[01:42:03.320 --> 01:42:05.320]  Into public policy
[01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:07.320]  And that is what's going on
[01:42:07.320 --> 01:42:09.320]  Well, you're absolutely right
[01:42:09.320 --> 01:42:11.320]  And I mean, can you speak to history?
[01:42:11.320 --> 01:42:13.320]  Because I know you write a lot about history
[01:42:13.320 --> 01:42:15.320]  Those that don't know it are doomed to repeat it
[01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:17.320]  And knowing history is the key to understanding
[01:42:17.320 --> 01:42:19.320]  Our present situation and the future
[01:42:19.320 --> 01:42:20.320]  To chart it
[01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:23.320]  It's like charts of ocean waves
[01:42:23.320 --> 01:42:25.320]  You need them or you'll run up on the rocks
[01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:27.320]  But people just ignore it
[01:42:27.320 --> 01:42:30.320]  At their extreme, foolhardy peril
[01:42:30.320 --> 01:42:32.320]  But historically
[01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:34.320]  Charity doesn't just grow and then stop
[01:42:34.320 --> 01:42:36.320]  Once it gets to this point
[01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:38.320]  It has to go all the way
[01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:40.320]  Number one, because it's greedy and enjoys power
[01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:43.320]  But number two, because they've made a lot of enemies
[01:42:43.320 --> 01:42:45.320]  And they've committed a lot of crimes
[01:42:45.320 --> 01:42:47.320]  And they've got to get total control in their mind
[01:42:47.320 --> 01:42:49.320]  So that they can be secure
[01:42:49.320 --> 01:42:51.320]  And not get in trouble for all the crimes
[01:42:51.320 --> 01:42:53.320]  They've committed
[01:42:53.320 --> 01:42:56.320]  Well, yeah
[01:42:56.320 --> 01:42:58.320]  That's putting it mildly
[01:42:58.320 --> 01:43:00.320]  The crimes they've committed
[01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:02.320]  That we could spend all day talking about that
[01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:04.320]  You know, but I think, you know
[01:43:04.320 --> 01:43:06.320]  The reason that Tim and I wrote this book
[01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:08.320]  Romans 13, the true meaning of submission
[01:43:08.320 --> 01:43:10.320]  Is because the biggest reason
[01:43:10.320 --> 01:43:13.320]  That we are in the mess we're in today
[01:43:13.320 --> 01:43:15.320]  Is because the pastors, Christians
[01:43:15.320 --> 01:43:17.320]  And churches of America
[01:43:17.320 --> 01:43:19.320]  Have simply refused
[01:43:19.320 --> 01:43:21.320]  To be the salt of the earth
[01:43:21.320 --> 01:43:23.320]  And to stand up as a resistance
[01:43:23.320 --> 01:43:25.320]  To this kind of tyrannical
[01:43:25.320 --> 01:43:28.320]  Of ideas, philosophies
[01:43:28.320 --> 01:43:30.320]  And now activities that are taking place
[01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:32.320]  They've been brainwashed
[01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:35.320]  In the pulpits and in the seminaries of America
[01:43:35.320 --> 01:43:38.320]  This erroneous, fallacious interpretation
[01:43:38.320 --> 01:43:40.320]  Of Romans 13
[01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:42.320]  That the government, because it's ordained of God
[01:43:42.320 --> 01:43:45.320]  Means that it has the right to do whatever it wants to do
[01:43:45.320 --> 01:43:48.320]  And no one as a Christian should resist
[01:43:48.320 --> 01:43:51.320]  This is the most foolhardy interpretation
[01:43:51.320 --> 01:43:54.320]  Of a biblical passage that I could ever think of
[01:43:54.320 --> 01:43:57.320]  But the problem is, it is pervasive
[01:43:57.320 --> 01:44:00.320]  Throughout our seminaries, our Bible colleges
[01:44:00.320 --> 01:44:03.320]  Our pulpits, every denomination is teaching this
[01:44:03.320 --> 01:44:06.320]  I would venture to say that over 90%
[01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:09.320]  Of the American churches, pastors, seminaries and colleges
[01:44:09.320 --> 01:44:12.320]  Are putting forth this interpretation of Romans 13
[01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:15.320]  And for those that don't know, all the World Council of Churches
[01:44:15.320 --> 01:44:17.320]  And before that National Council
[01:44:17.320 --> 01:44:20.320]  Set up, what, 100 years ago by the Rockefellers publicly
[01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:23.320]  All they had to do was go in and give grants and lobby
[01:44:23.320 --> 01:44:26.320]  To take control of what, the 20 or so big denominations
[01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:28.320]  They order them what to preach
[01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:30.320]  To the point of, I could play a newscast saying
[01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:32.320]  It is of the Lord to go to FEMA camps
[01:44:32.320 --> 01:44:34.320]  It is of the Lord to take shots
[01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:36.320]  It is of the Lord to do what you're told
[01:44:36.320 --> 01:44:38.320]  And go to the camp, I mean that's a quote
[01:44:38.320 --> 01:44:40.320]  I'm sure you've seen that newscast
[01:44:40.320 --> 01:44:42.320]  Where they actually admit this and we got the documents
[01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:44.320]  Pastor Butch Pa did years ago
[01:44:44.320 --> 01:44:46.320]  And then I got more documents here on Genesis
[01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:48.320]  And then people didn't believe the documents
[01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:50.320]  And then later they came out and said, yeah
[01:44:50.320 --> 01:44:53.320]  We created over 100,000 preachers to spy on you
[01:44:53.320 --> 01:44:55.320]  And to tell you to go to a FEMA camp
[01:44:55.320 --> 01:44:57.320]  I mean that's right out of red dawn
[01:44:57.320 --> 01:44:59.320]  Yeah, well not only that
[01:44:59.320 --> 01:45:01.320]  But we know that FEMA has these
[01:45:01.320 --> 01:45:03.320]  As you already mentioned these
[01:45:03.320 --> 01:45:05.320]  Clearly response teams that's going around
[01:45:05.320 --> 01:45:08.320]  Training pastors that in the event of a national emergency
[01:45:08.320 --> 01:45:10.320]  Quote, quote, declared by the president
[01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:12.320]  The pastors are going to be utilized
[01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:14.320]  By the government, namely FEMA
[01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:16.320]  To encourage their congregants
[01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:19.320]  To turn over their firearms to the federal government
[01:45:19.320 --> 01:45:22.320]  And I've had pastors, I've talked to pastors
[01:45:22.320 --> 01:45:24.320]  That have attended these seminars
[01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:27.320]  I've seen some of the manuals
[01:45:27.320 --> 01:45:29.320]  That they have distributed
[01:45:29.320 --> 01:45:31.320]  I've heard the first hand testimony
[01:45:31.320 --> 01:45:32.320]  From some of these pastors
[01:45:32.320 --> 01:45:34.320]  No, we got the manuals
[01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:36.320]  They even go on the news, but here's the deal
[01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:38.320]  People couldn't believe it when it wasn't public
[01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:39.320]  When we first got the documents
[01:45:39.320 --> 01:45:40.320]  Then they even admitted it
[01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:42.320]  And folks said, well I guess her and my guns in
[01:45:42.320 --> 01:45:44.320]  Is of the Lord, but think about that
[01:45:44.320 --> 01:45:46.320]  All over the country for at least eight years
[01:45:46.320 --> 01:45:48.320]  Secretly training preachers
[01:45:48.320 --> 01:45:51.320]  To tell their flock hand your guns and go to the camp
[01:45:51.320 --> 01:45:53.320]  That proves they're preparing this pastor
[01:45:53.320 --> 01:45:55.320]  I mean that is such a huge revelation
[01:45:55.320 --> 01:45:56.320]  Please continue
[01:45:56.320 --> 01:45:58.320]  Well let me tell you, let me tell you something
[01:45:58.320 --> 01:46:01.320]  That I've learned just recently to Alex
[01:46:01.320 --> 01:46:03.320]  You know, just a few months ago
[01:46:03.320 --> 01:46:05.320]  Last October, my family and I moved up here
[01:46:05.320 --> 01:46:07.320]  To Montana
[01:46:07.320 --> 01:46:11.320]  We are now about 80 miles south of the Canadian border
[01:46:11.320 --> 01:46:13.320]  I have met some people
[01:46:13.320 --> 01:46:15.320]  That are in the subcontracting business
[01:46:15.320 --> 01:46:17.320]  That are doing work right now
[01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:19.320]  With the federal government
[01:46:19.320 --> 01:46:22.320]  That are building throughout the northern border
[01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:25.320]  It's interesting, not on the southern border
[01:46:25.320 --> 01:46:27.320]  But on the northern border with Canada
[01:46:27.320 --> 01:46:30.320]  They are building something like
[01:46:30.320 --> 01:46:34.320]  I'll take us between 35 and 40
[01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:39.320]  Of these border patrol stations
[01:46:39.320 --> 01:46:43.320]  Complete with munitions, supplies
[01:46:43.320 --> 01:46:47.320]  Complete with interrogation rooms
[01:46:47.320 --> 01:46:50.320]  Complete with shackles
[01:46:50.320 --> 01:46:54.320]  And rooms for imprisonment, et cetera
[01:46:54.320 --> 01:46:56.320]  And they're building them right now
[01:46:56.320 --> 01:46:59.320]  As we speak all across the northern border
[01:46:59.320 --> 01:47:01.320]  Between the United States and Canada
[01:47:01.320 --> 01:47:04.320]  And that's to keep Americans from fleeing the tyranny
[01:47:04.320 --> 01:47:06.320]  It's been, again, roaches go in
[01:47:06.320 --> 01:47:07.320]  They don't get out
[01:47:07.320 --> 01:47:09.320]  Well yeah, you gotta ask yourself a question
[01:47:09.320 --> 01:47:11.320]  Why are they building this along the northern border
[01:47:11.320 --> 01:47:13.320]  And not the southern border
[01:47:13.320 --> 01:47:15.320]  The southern border is wide open
[01:47:15.320 --> 01:47:17.320]  They're coming in through a sieve
[01:47:17.320 --> 01:47:19.320]  And yet here in the northern border
[01:47:19.320 --> 01:47:21.320]  There's virtually no problem whatsoever
[01:47:21.320 --> 01:47:22.320]  With illegal immigration
[01:47:22.320 --> 01:47:24.320]  They're building these kind of facilities
[01:47:24.320 --> 01:47:26.320]  Throughout the entire perimeter of the northern border
[01:47:26.320 --> 01:47:28.320]  And like I said, like a roach motel
[01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:31.320]  The American people are meant to stay inside this thing
[01:47:31.320 --> 01:47:33.320]  And that's admitted that they've come out there
[01:47:33.320 --> 01:47:35.320]  Using Homeland Security money for the border
[01:47:35.320 --> 01:47:38.320]  For domestic operations and to harass citizens
[01:47:38.320 --> 01:47:40.320]  Pastor, I mean, for anybody
[01:47:40.320 --> 01:47:42.320]  Who's been in denial and thought, oh, Ron Paul
[01:47:42.320 --> 01:47:45.320]  You know, Chuck Baldwin, all these people
[01:47:45.320 --> 01:47:47.320]  Alex Jones, you know, they're alarmist
[01:47:47.320 --> 01:47:49.320]  Oh really, we just studied history
[01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:52.320]  I mean, even myself, it's happening faster than I thought
[01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:54.320]  And as I say every day
[01:47:54.320 --> 01:47:56.320]  It's one thing to intellectually know this
[01:47:56.320 --> 01:47:57.320]  And to spiritually know it
[01:47:57.320 --> 01:47:59.320]  It's another thing to actually see it happening
[01:47:59.320 --> 01:48:01.320]  And to know it's only gonna get crazier
[01:48:01.320 --> 01:48:04.320]  How far do you think that this is gonna go
[01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:06.320]  Before this gets turned around?
[01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:09.320]  Or will it, biblically, do you believe not be turned around?
[01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:11.320]  I mean, I know you've basically gone out to the middle of nowhere
[01:48:11.320 --> 01:48:13.320]  A lot of people that are
[01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:16.320]  I know I've moved outside town, we can all feel it
[01:48:18.320 --> 01:48:22.320]  Yeah, I can tell you that since we have moved here to Montana
[01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:25.320]  Literally scores, and I'm not exaggerating, Alex
[01:48:25.320 --> 01:48:29.320]  Scores of families have either already moved here
[01:48:29.320 --> 01:48:32.320]  Or are in the process of moving here
[01:48:32.320 --> 01:48:34.320]  God is putting it in the hearts of people
[01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:37.320]  I really believe that God is calling a remnant
[01:48:37.320 --> 01:48:40.320]  To himself, and this feeling
[01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:42.320]  This inner gut feeling
[01:48:42.320 --> 01:48:45.320]  That, you know, the hammer is ready to fall
[01:48:45.320 --> 01:48:49.320]  And we need to be in a position to take care of our families
[01:48:49.320 --> 01:48:53.320]  And to be around fellow patriots and brothers
[01:48:53.320 --> 01:48:56.320]  You know, who are like-minded
[01:48:56.320 --> 01:48:59.320]  Is burning in the hearts of people all over America
[01:48:59.320 --> 01:49:02.320]  I can tell you, I mean, I'm not beating them at all
[01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:04.320]  Did you know before you even said this
[01:49:04.320 --> 01:49:07.320]  I've had a burning to move to Montana
[01:49:07.320 --> 01:49:09.320]  Is that right?
[01:49:09.320 --> 01:49:11.320]  Yeah, Montana or Wyoming, mainly Montana
[01:49:11.320 --> 01:49:14.320]  I just wanted to get out of here and get onto the top of the hill somewhere
[01:49:14.320 --> 01:49:17.320]  And do a daily broadcast, but that's it
[01:49:17.320 --> 01:49:20.320]  Every instinct I've got is get out of the city
[01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:22.320]  Get out, get out, get out
[01:49:22.320 --> 01:49:24.320]  Is that what you were feeling?
[01:49:24.320 --> 01:49:27.320]  Oh, boy, I tell you, we were feeling it for two to three years
[01:49:27.320 --> 01:49:30.320]  And we researched, and my family and I
[01:49:30.320 --> 01:49:33.320]  We researched hard, we prayed, we agonized
[01:49:33.320 --> 01:49:36.320]  And we narrowed it down to the mountain states
[01:49:36.320 --> 01:49:38.320]  And then from there to Montana
[01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:42.320]  Yeah, you had the big radio show, the big church, everything
[01:49:42.320 --> 01:49:45.320]  You just pulled up and left, I'm sorry, go back to what you said you researched
[01:49:45.320 --> 01:49:48.320]  Yeah, we did, we left it all
[01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:51.320]  And yeah, we researched it intently
[01:49:51.320 --> 01:49:55.320]  And finally determined the Flathead Valley was where we should be
[01:49:55.320 --> 01:49:58.320]  And that's where we are, but I tell you what, the only regret I have is
[01:49:58.320 --> 01:50:00.320]  Why didn't God send me here ten years ago?
[01:50:00.320 --> 01:50:03.320]  Because this is just marvelous
[01:50:03.320 --> 01:50:07.320]  To realize, to be around people that love freedom
[01:50:07.320 --> 01:50:10.320]  To be around people that see what's going on
[01:50:10.320 --> 01:50:13.320]  That know what's going on, and we started to do fellowship
[01:50:13.320 --> 01:50:16.320]  We call it Liberty Fellowship here in Kalispell
[01:50:16.320 --> 01:50:19.320]  And it's comprised of people that know what's going on
[01:50:19.320 --> 01:50:22.320]  When you talk to them, they don't look at you like a deer
[01:50:22.320 --> 01:50:25.320]  And the headlights there, they appreciate the principles of freedom and liberty
[01:50:25.320 --> 01:50:27.320]  We preach those principles every Sunday
[01:50:27.320 --> 01:50:30.320]  I mean, the people are like-minded, there's a camaraderie
[01:50:30.320 --> 01:50:33.320]  There's a fellowship, a true fellowship
[01:50:33.320 --> 01:50:35.320]  And these people know what's going on
[01:50:35.320 --> 01:50:39.320]  And many of these people are prepared, they've been prepared
[01:50:39.320 --> 01:50:41.320]  They're helping others to prepare
[01:50:41.320 --> 01:50:46.320]  It's just a refreshment that I cannot express
[01:50:46.320 --> 01:50:48.320]  I just love it
[01:50:48.320 --> 01:50:52.320]  Well, things are going to have to get really bad before America finally gets up off its knees
[01:50:52.320 --> 01:50:53.320]  But it's starting to happen
[01:50:53.320 --> 01:50:56.320]  Stay there, I want to get into the meat of Romans 13
[01:50:56.320 --> 01:50:59.320]  And then phone calls, straight ahead, stay with us
[01:51:26.320 --> 01:51:35.320]  We the people grow cotton, we fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit
[01:51:35.320 --> 01:51:38.320]  And carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest
[01:51:38.320 --> 01:51:40.320]  Forcing taxes to service debt
[01:51:40.320 --> 01:51:43.320]  This capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank
[01:51:43.320 --> 01:51:47.320]  Ishwing the public currency as a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army
[01:51:47.320 --> 01:51:51.320]  Hi, Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system

[01:52:59.320 --> 01:53:05.320]  Question, can functional magnetic resonance imaging be used to read our minds?
[01:53:05.320 --> 01:53:11.320]  Author Jose Calazzo answers yes in his two new books, America's New Slavery
[01:53:11.320 --> 01:53:24.320]  For more than 13 years, author Jose Calazzo has been trying to prove that the U.S. government has the capacity to read a person's thoughts with a revolutionary technology known as fMRI
[01:53:24.320 --> 01:53:29.320]  Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging and there is proof that it exists
[01:53:29.320 --> 01:53:36.320]  America's New Slavery explores this technology and its many possible applications in national security
[01:53:36.320 --> 01:53:39.320]  Who has access to it? How is it being used?
[01:53:39.320 --> 01:53:47.320]  As America's salvation rests in this technology, these and many other questions are answered in America's New Slavery
[01:53:47.320 --> 01:53:55.320]  The new books by Jose Calazzo, available on BN.com, Amazon.com and Borders.com
[01:53:55.320 --> 01:54:10.320]  Because New Slavery, all Americans should be concerned
[01:54:25.320 --> 01:54:37.320]  All right, Pastor Chuck Baldwin with us another 20-30 minutes to the next hour, we'll go to your phone calls on any of the issues you have to raise
[01:54:37.320 --> 01:54:43.320]  But in this little short segment, the next one, let's get into the new book, we'll also tell folks where they can get it and get it to their pastor
[01:54:43.320 --> 01:54:55.320]  These are not churches, these are spy centers, these are areas for men to be taught to be weaklings and to take their Prozac and to do business deals
[01:54:55.320 --> 01:55:00.320]  And for people to basically cheat on their husbands and wives, and that's my experience in big mega churches in Dallas
[01:55:00.320 --> 01:55:03.320]  And I grew up around some of the preachers, believe me, it's not a pretty sight
[01:55:03.320 --> 01:55:14.320]  But obviously, if the preachers aren't really preaching what's in the Bible and don't know that 1776 was started by the real preachers who weren't going to be slaves and the black brigades as they were called
[01:55:14.320 --> 01:55:23.320]  Then, I mean, immediately, if they're not talking about freedom and standing up against tyranny and being the light of the world, you know you're in a wicked church
[01:55:23.320 --> 01:55:29.320]  But explain how they use Romans 13 and how they twisted Pastor Chuck Baldwin
[01:55:29.320 --> 01:55:45.320]  Well, what they do is they teach that Romans 13 would have every Christian to submit to civil government, regardless of the kind of edict that government may put forth
[01:55:45.320 --> 01:56:00.320]  In other words, if government is wicked and evil, requiring men to submit to evil and wickedness as a Christian that we are to submit to that evil government
[01:56:00.320 --> 01:56:15.320]  Because Romans 13 teaches us to do so, it is a totally passive application, an erroneous application of this wonderful passage of Scripture that it actually does just the opposite
[01:56:15.320 --> 01:56:20.320]  That's why Tim and I wrote the book, it's called Romans 13, the true meaning of submission
[01:56:20.320 --> 01:56:33.320]  And we go into it verse by verse, we go into it in depth, we look back into the history of the Christian forebears, we talk about the Christian philosophers and theologians of years gone by
[01:56:33.320 --> 01:56:43.320]  We compare what they had to say to what preachers are saying today, we go back into the Old Testament, we look at the Scripture from both the Old and New Testament standpoint
[01:56:43.320 --> 01:56:53.320]  And we see the consistent teaching of Scripture is just the opposite of what this current interpretation that is being used is
[01:56:53.320 --> 01:57:05.320]  And as a result, this book, Romans 13, is in my estimation a blockbuster because there's nothing else like it in print that I know of today, at least not recently
[01:57:05.320 --> 01:57:18.320]  And we are trying to get the word out, the Christians, the churches, the pastors, and showing, giving them the scriptural, historical foundation of the true meaning of Romans 13
[01:57:18.320 --> 01:57:29.320]  For folks that don't know, it was one of Hitler's favorite verses to take out of context, and for those that don't know what it says, why don't you state Romans 13 for listeners
[01:57:29.320 --> 01:57:47.320]  Yeah, Romans 13 basically says that the higher powers that we are to submit to the higher powers in verse 1, but the higher powers mentioned in verse 1 are constituted to be the highest power
[01:57:47.320 --> 01:57:59.320]  And the fact of the matter is, the higher power, which is the civil power, is not the authority of God, is not the highest power, all power is subjected, Alex, all power is jurisdictional
[01:57:59.320 --> 01:58:05.320]  Every single person in any position of authority or power has a jurisdiction related to that authority
[01:58:05.320 --> 01:58:09.320]  He has no right to violate or transgress the parameters in the jurisdiction
[01:58:09.320 --> 01:58:18.320]  It's like you have a right to defend yourself, and you have a right to defend yourself in your own home, but you don't have your right to go into somebody else's house when they attack you defend yourself
[01:58:18.320 --> 01:58:27.320]  It's all common sense, jurisdictional, and the system understands this, and also they say, well do whatever government says it's your king
[01:58:27.320 --> 01:58:31.320]  Well in America, we, the people, right, we created the government
[01:58:31.320 --> 01:58:40.320]  So, so we're gonna, I mean, but now our government is a bunch of foreign banks that paid off our politicians, so we've got to submit to Al Gore and George Soros

[02:00:39.320 --> 02:00:43.320]  A lot of other global and police state TSA news
[02:00:43.320 --> 02:00:45.320]  But the pastor will be with us to the bottom of the hour
[02:00:45.320 --> 02:00:47.320]  So again, your call is coming up in the next segment
[02:00:47.320 --> 02:00:49.320]  Getting back to this new book you've got out
[02:00:49.320 --> 02:00:51.320]  Even if someone isn't a Christian out there
[02:00:51.320 --> 02:00:53.320]  And they wonder why the churches in America
[02:00:53.320 --> 02:00:55.320]  Just support any type of illegal war
[02:00:55.320 --> 02:00:56.320]  Any type of torture
[02:00:56.320 --> 02:00:58.320]  Any type of corruption
[02:00:58.320 --> 02:01:01.320]  Any type of forced inoculations
[02:01:01.320 --> 02:01:03.320]  It's because they become state-run churches
[02:01:03.320 --> 02:01:05.320]  Like in China or Soviet Russia
[02:01:05.320 --> 02:01:07.320]  And so it's important to educate pastors
[02:01:07.320 --> 02:01:09.320]  About what's going on
[02:01:09.320 --> 02:01:11.320]  Now, continuing with Romans 13
[02:01:11.320 --> 02:01:12.320]  And what it really states
[02:01:12.320 --> 02:01:14.320]  And what it's been turned into
[02:01:14.320 --> 02:01:16.320]  Right, thank you very much, Alex
[02:01:16.320 --> 02:01:18.320]  And Romans 13
[02:01:18.320 --> 02:01:21.320]  We talked at the end of the before the break
[02:01:21.320 --> 02:01:23.320]  In verse 1 where it says
[02:01:23.320 --> 02:01:25.320]  Whatever is sold to the higher powers
[02:01:25.320 --> 02:01:27.320]  There's no power but of God
[02:01:27.320 --> 02:01:29.320]  The powers that be are ordained of God
[02:01:29.320 --> 02:01:30.320]  And so forth
[02:01:30.320 --> 02:01:33.320]  And what they do is they translate those verses
[02:01:33.320 --> 02:01:36.320]  Into meaning that we are to submit to government
[02:01:36.320 --> 02:01:38.320]  No matter how evil, no matter how wicked
[02:01:38.320 --> 02:01:40.320]  No matter how unconstitutional, et cetera, et cetera
[02:01:40.320 --> 02:01:42.320]  And what we've done
[02:01:42.320 --> 02:01:45.320]  My son is a constitutional attorney, as you know
[02:01:45.320 --> 02:01:48.320]  And he and I collaborated on this book
[02:01:48.320 --> 02:01:50.320]  We call it Romans 13
[02:01:50.320 --> 02:01:52.320]  The true meaning of submission
[02:01:52.320 --> 02:01:54.320]  And we go into the depth of the Word of God
[02:01:54.320 --> 02:01:56.320]  In both testaments
[02:01:56.320 --> 02:01:58.320]  We look at the scriptures
[02:01:58.320 --> 02:02:00.320]  The myriad scriptures that deal with this
[02:02:00.320 --> 02:02:03.320]  There's hundreds and hundreds of scriptures
[02:02:03.320 --> 02:02:05.320]  That deal with this subject
[02:02:05.320 --> 02:02:06.320]  Not just Romans 13
[02:02:06.320 --> 02:02:08.320]  The passage does not stand alone
[02:02:08.320 --> 02:02:11.320]  We know that the scripture is to be interpreted
[02:02:11.320 --> 02:02:13.320]  By the wide of other scriptures
[02:02:13.320 --> 02:02:16.320]  And so we've delved into the various scriptures
[02:02:16.320 --> 02:02:18.320]  We've delved into history
[02:02:18.320 --> 02:02:20.320]  Well, the entire Bible is the prophets
[02:02:20.320 --> 02:02:22.320]  And people being killed for not submitting
[02:02:22.320 --> 02:02:23.320]  To corrupt government
[02:02:23.320 --> 02:02:24.320]  Absolutely
[02:02:24.320 --> 02:02:26.320]  And the king says bow down to, you know,
[02:02:26.320 --> 02:02:27.320]  Booblebub or whatever
[02:02:27.320 --> 02:02:29.320]  And he says no, so get into the lion's den
[02:02:29.320 --> 02:02:31.320]  Or I'm going to crucify you upside down
[02:02:31.320 --> 02:02:33.320]  Or I'm going to sell you into slavery
[02:02:33.320 --> 02:02:35.320]  The whole Bible is about resisting tyranny
[02:02:35.320 --> 02:02:37.320]  Absolutely, and I make that statement
[02:02:37.320 --> 02:02:39.320]  In the course of my address
[02:02:39.320 --> 02:02:41.320]  I preached a four-part series based on the book
[02:02:41.320 --> 02:02:43.320]  And I made that very state
[02:02:43.320 --> 02:02:44.320]  That very observation
[02:02:44.320 --> 02:02:46.320]  That if you look at biblical history
[02:02:46.320 --> 02:02:49.320]  You go back to the Old Testament even into the new
[02:02:49.320 --> 02:02:51.320]  Perhaps a majority
[02:02:51.320 --> 02:02:53.320]  I can't say that equivocally
[02:02:53.320 --> 02:02:56.320]  But perhaps a majority of the stories
[02:02:56.320 --> 02:02:59.320]  Of the Bible deal with
[02:02:59.320 --> 02:03:02.320]  Someone resisting civil authority
[02:03:02.320 --> 02:03:04.320]  I think almost, I'd say 80%
[02:03:04.320 --> 02:03:06.320]  I mean, look at John the Baptist getting his head cut off
[02:03:06.320 --> 02:03:08.320]  I mean, can you think of anybody?
[02:03:08.320 --> 02:03:11.320]  I mean, Moses didn't do what Pharaoh said
[02:03:11.320 --> 02:03:13.320]  I mean, the whole thing's a sick joke
[02:03:13.320 --> 02:03:16.320]  It's a joke the entire Bible
[02:03:16.320 --> 02:03:19.320]  Is about resisting tyranny
[02:03:19.320 --> 02:03:20.320]  Exactly right
[02:03:20.320 --> 02:03:22.320]  And again, that's why I say that
[02:03:22.320 --> 02:03:24.320]  This book is so needful
[02:03:24.320 --> 02:03:27.320]  And as you noted, every tyrant in history
[02:03:27.320 --> 02:03:28.320]  Has used Romans 13
[02:03:28.320 --> 02:03:31.320]  Especially if there's a Christian people involved
[02:03:31.320 --> 02:03:33.320]  To try and subjugate the folks
[02:03:33.320 --> 02:03:35.320]  Into their wishes
[02:03:35.320 --> 02:03:37.320]  Hitler did it
[02:03:37.320 --> 02:03:41.320]  We know that this is a favorite passage of scripture
[02:03:41.320 --> 02:03:45.320]  From those who would like to tyrannize us
[02:03:45.320 --> 02:03:48.320]  And to enslave us
[02:03:48.320 --> 02:03:51.320]  This book, Romans 13
[02:03:51.320 --> 02:03:54.320]  I just don't know of anything right now
[02:03:54.320 --> 02:03:55.320]  That's out there
[02:03:55.320 --> 02:03:57.320]  That's why we put this together
[02:03:57.320 --> 02:03:59.320]  In my frustration as a pastor
[02:03:59.320 --> 02:04:01.320]  For over 35 years
[02:04:01.320 --> 02:04:03.320]  In dealing with churches and preachers
[02:04:03.320 --> 02:04:05.320]  And Christian people
[02:04:05.320 --> 02:04:07.320]  And hearing this over and over and over again
[02:04:07.320 --> 02:04:11.320]  That in the 501c3 incorporation status
[02:04:11.320 --> 02:04:15.320]  Those two things have subjugated the church
[02:04:15.320 --> 02:04:18.320]  To Caesar more than any two things
[02:04:18.320 --> 02:04:19.320]  I can think of
[02:04:19.320 --> 02:04:22.320]  And that's why this book is so necessary
[02:04:22.320 --> 02:04:24.320]  Well, let's go over a few of the accounts
[02:04:24.320 --> 02:04:27.320]  In the Bible of people being evil
[02:04:27.320 --> 02:04:29.320]  And resisting murderers and tyrants
[02:04:29.320 --> 02:04:31.320]  According to the modern preachers
[02:04:31.320 --> 02:04:33.320]  And then let's go through some of the passages
[02:04:33.320 --> 02:04:35.320]  Because, I mean, there's just so many
[02:04:35.320 --> 02:04:37.320]  I can't even remember
[02:04:37.320 --> 02:04:39.320]  Who will rise up for me against the wicked one
[02:04:39.320 --> 02:04:41.320]  On and on and on
[02:04:41.320 --> 02:04:43.320]  About if you see evil being done
[02:04:43.320 --> 02:04:45.320]  And you don't try to resist it
[02:04:45.320 --> 02:04:46.320]  Then the blood's on your hands
[02:04:46.320 --> 02:04:49.320]  I mean, let's go through a bunch of those verses
[02:04:49.320 --> 02:04:51.320]  If you've got them there in front of you, pastor
[02:04:51.320 --> 02:04:52.320]  On the other side
[02:04:52.320 --> 02:04:53.320]  Then we'll jam in some calls as well
[02:04:53.320 --> 02:04:55.320]  And continue with calls throughout the end of the broadcast
[02:04:55.320 --> 02:04:57.320]  And the pastor leaves us in T-minus
[02:04:57.320 --> 02:05:04.320]  Twenty-five minutes, stay with us
[02:05:27.320 --> 02:05:29.320]  And that's it for today
[02:05:29.320 --> 02:05:31.320]  I hope you enjoyed it
[02:05:31.320 --> 02:06:00.320]  I hope you enjoyed it

[02:07:00.320 --> 02:07:02.320]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting
[02:07:02.320 --> 02:07:04.320]  That in 2011
[02:07:04.320 --> 02:07:06.320]  We will witness the most important day
[02:07:06.320 --> 02:07:08.320]  In America in more than 50 years
[02:07:08.320 --> 02:07:10.320]  He says it will change everything about our lives
[02:07:10.320 --> 02:07:12.320]  The way you shop, travel, invest
[02:07:12.320 --> 02:07:13.320]  Educate your children
[02:07:13.320 --> 02:07:15.320]  And even how you take care of your health
[02:07:15.320 --> 02:07:16.320]  And your own family
[02:07:16.320 --> 02:07:18.320]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions
[02:07:18.320 --> 02:07:19.320]  Over the years
[02:07:19.320 --> 02:07:20.320]  The crazy part is
[02:07:20.320 --> 02:07:21.320]  He's usually right
[02:07:21.320 --> 02:07:24.320]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM
[02:07:24.320 --> 02:07:25.320]  Danny May, Freddie Mac
[02:07:25.320 --> 02:07:26.320]  An America's biggest mall owner
[02:07:26.320 --> 02:07:27.320]  General growth properties
[02:07:27.320 --> 02:07:29.320]  In fact, Barron's called his work
[02:07:29.320 --> 02:07:31.320]  A dire prophecy
[02:07:31.320 --> 02:07:32.320]  Recently, he created a video
[02:07:32.320 --> 02:07:34.320]  Which you can watch online for free
[02:07:34.320 --> 02:07:36.320]  Detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet
[02:07:36.320 --> 02:07:38.320]  And it's a real eye-opener
[02:07:38.320 --> 02:07:39.320]  I can't stress this enough
[02:07:39.320 --> 02:07:41.320]  You should at least watch this free video

[02:08:20.320 --> 02:08:22.320]  Alex Jones
[02:08:24.320 --> 02:08:26.320]  We are back live in hour number 3
[02:08:26.320 --> 02:08:29.320]  Covering the incredible treason
[02:08:29.320 --> 02:08:30.320]  Let's see how
[02:08:30.320 --> 02:08:32.320]  About it told you five years ago
[02:08:32.320 --> 02:08:34.320]  Had they're gonna have a council of 13
[02:08:34.320 --> 02:08:35.320]  Bills will now originate
[02:08:35.320 --> 02:08:37.320]  At least on spending and cutting
[02:08:37.320 --> 02:08:39.320]  But then that's pretty much the whole government
[02:08:39.320 --> 02:08:40.320]  Harry Reid says it affects everything
[02:08:40.320 --> 02:08:43.320]  Including guns and Larry Pratt agrees
[02:08:43.320 --> 02:08:45.320]  But imagine, about it told you five years ago
[02:08:45.320 --> 02:08:47.320]  They'll have a council of 13
[02:08:47.320 --> 02:08:48.320]  With the president at its head
[02:08:48.320 --> 02:08:50.320]  And the bills will originate there
[02:08:50.320 --> 02:08:52.320]  And there's no filibustering or amendments
[02:08:52.320 --> 02:08:54.320]  And then if you don't vote for their
[02:08:54.320 --> 02:08:57.320]  Recommendation, that's how it's worded
[02:08:57.320 --> 02:08:59.320]  Then they just implement whatever they want
[02:08:59.320 --> 02:09:01.320]  It's like, you have free will
[02:09:01.320 --> 02:09:03.320]  As long as you do what I say
[02:09:03.320 --> 02:09:06.320]  I mean, I can't believe it's that naked
[02:09:06.320 --> 02:09:08.320]  And that it's not a bigger issue
[02:09:08.320 --> 02:09:10.320]  But see, we're becoming accustomed to this
[02:09:10.320 --> 02:09:12.320]  You know, growing up
[02:09:12.320 --> 02:09:15.320]  I, you know, like any teenager
[02:09:15.320 --> 02:09:17.320]  Saw a lot of racy stuff, did some wild things
[02:09:17.320 --> 02:09:19.320]  And I was always taking a church when I was young
[02:09:19.320 --> 02:09:21.320]  And I thought, you know, this is all just goody tissues
[02:09:21.320 --> 02:09:24.320]  People that obsess over don't do anything bad
[02:09:24.320 --> 02:09:26.320]  Because it leads to a lot worse stuff
[02:09:26.320 --> 02:09:27.320]  And the older I've gotten, I've realized
[02:09:27.320 --> 02:09:29.320]  That's absolutely true
[02:09:29.320 --> 02:09:31.320]  It's societies that are pious
[02:09:31.320 --> 02:09:34.320]  And into being focused and clean and good
[02:09:34.320 --> 02:09:36.320]  Are not because these are wimps, ladies and gentlemen
[02:09:36.320 --> 02:09:39.320]  It's because they don't want their children destroyed
[02:09:39.320 --> 02:09:42.320]  It's because you, in fact, normally see very pious
[02:09:42.320 --> 02:09:45.320]  Cultures come out of giant, murderous, long wars
[02:09:45.320 --> 02:09:47.320]  And corruption
[02:09:47.320 --> 02:09:49.320]  And once they get out of it, they go, whew
[02:09:49.320 --> 02:09:50.320]  How did we ever get into that?
[02:09:50.320 --> 02:09:51.320]  Most of their families dead
[02:09:51.320 --> 02:09:53.320]  Mama, daddy, totally wiped out
[02:09:53.320 --> 02:09:57.320]  Study history, and they go, we are getting ourselves in order
[02:09:57.320 --> 02:09:59.320]  Okay, and that's what being straight and strong
[02:09:59.320 --> 02:10:01.320]  Is all about, and I'm not even saying I'm perfect
[02:10:01.320 --> 02:10:03.320]  But I at least know
[02:10:03.320 --> 02:10:06.320]  And I'm ashamed of the bad things I do
[02:10:06.320 --> 02:10:08.320]  Unintentionally, you know, you catch yourself saying
[02:10:08.320 --> 02:10:09.320]  Something doing something
[02:10:09.320 --> 02:10:10.320]  And if you do the things I'm talking about
[02:10:10.320 --> 02:10:12.320]  You go, Alex, you're a great guy, that's no big deal
[02:10:12.320 --> 02:10:14.320]  No, it is a big deal
[02:10:14.320 --> 02:10:16.320]  Because little things turn into big things
[02:10:16.320 --> 02:10:18.320]  And, you know, they sell evil
[02:10:18.320 --> 02:10:20.320]  Like it's a sexy devil cheerleader
[02:10:20.320 --> 02:10:21.320]  You know, like the bumper sticker
[02:10:21.320 --> 02:10:23.320]  And it's fun, and it's cool
[02:10:23.320 --> 02:10:26.320]  Just like Madison Avenue advertises their Hollywood drugs
[02:10:26.320 --> 02:10:28.320]  Illegal drugs are fun
[02:10:28.320 --> 02:10:30.320]  They're just advertising CIA products for you
[02:10:30.320 --> 02:10:33.320]  No, it's not fun turning into a crack whore
[02:10:33.320 --> 02:10:36.320]  Or going to prison
[02:10:36.320 --> 02:10:38.320]  I love the old Pinocchio
[02:10:38.320 --> 02:10:39.320]  One of the only good Disney movies out there
[02:10:39.320 --> 02:10:41.320]  With a good message
[02:10:41.320 --> 02:10:43.320]  You know, they get him to knock out some windows
[02:10:43.320 --> 02:10:45.320]  Drink some beer, smoke some cigars
[02:10:45.320 --> 02:10:47.320]  You know, gamble, whatever
[02:10:47.320 --> 02:10:49.320]  And then they turn into donkeys
[02:10:49.320 --> 02:10:52.320]  And get loaded on a ship to be slaves
[02:10:52.320 --> 02:10:55.320]  And it's real simple, but that's how it works
[02:10:55.320 --> 02:10:57.320]  They get you in peer pressure
[02:10:57.320 --> 02:10:59.320]  They get you in a corrupt culture
[02:10:59.320 --> 02:11:01.320]  Now see, I'm preaching, I got a preacher on
[02:11:01.320 --> 02:11:04.320]  Pastor, presidential candidate, constitution party
[02:11:04.320 --> 02:11:06.320]  Chuck Baldwin, I start preaching and ranting
[02:11:06.320 --> 02:11:08.320]  It's just that now I've studied history
[02:11:08.320 --> 02:11:10.320]  Now I've learned a lot more
[02:11:10.320 --> 02:11:12.320]  And I think if you just tell kids up front
[02:11:12.320 --> 02:11:14.320]  Yeah, you'll think it's fun, sex, drugs
[02:11:14.320 --> 02:11:16.320]  Things like that up front
[02:11:16.320 --> 02:11:18.320]  I never really got into the drug part
[02:11:18.320 --> 02:11:20.320]  But I saw it with friends
[02:11:20.320 --> 02:11:22.320]  I mean, I had friends that looked like John Wayne
[02:11:22.320 --> 02:11:24.320]  Football players, wealthy families
[02:11:24.320 --> 02:11:26.320]  Whole future ahead of them
[02:11:26.320 --> 02:11:28.320]  Next time I saw them two years later
[02:11:28.320 --> 02:11:30.320]  Crackheads in South Dallas
[02:11:30.320 --> 02:11:33.320]  I mean, guys that had the beauty queen
[02:11:33.320 --> 02:11:35.320]  I mean, guys that had it all
[02:11:35.320 --> 02:11:37.320]  Guys, we'd go out to get pizza
[02:11:37.320 --> 02:11:39.320]  And women were just running up
[02:11:39.320 --> 02:11:41.320]  And just zombie crackheads, prison
[02:11:41.320 --> 02:11:43.320]  Some of them dead years later
[02:11:43.320 --> 02:11:45.320]  Now I am ranting
[02:11:45.320 --> 02:11:48.320]  Sorry, going back to the pastor
[02:11:48.320 --> 02:11:50.320]  Pastor, please, shotgun through
[02:11:50.320 --> 02:11:52.320]  Romans 13, what it really says
[02:11:52.320 --> 02:11:54.320]  Versus the other passages
[02:11:54.320 --> 02:11:56.320]  And stories in the Bible
[02:11:56.320 --> 02:11:58.320]  Well, yeah, right, Alex, thanks a lot
[02:11:58.320 --> 02:12:01.320]  And yeah, you mentioned right before the break
[02:12:01.320 --> 02:12:03.320]  Let's talk about some of the examples in the Bible
[02:12:03.320 --> 02:12:06.320]  Of those who resisted unlawful authority
[02:12:06.320 --> 02:12:08.320]  And let's think about Daniel
[02:12:08.320 --> 02:12:10.320]  One of the great stories of the Scripture
[02:12:10.320 --> 02:12:12.320]  Every Sunday school boy and girl
[02:12:12.320 --> 02:12:14.320]  Hears about Daniel
[02:12:14.320 --> 02:12:16.320]  And the lion's den
[02:12:16.320 --> 02:12:18.320]  How did he get to the lion's den?
[02:12:18.320 --> 02:12:20.320]  He got there because his civil authority government
[02:12:20.320 --> 02:12:22.320]  Put him there
[02:12:22.320 --> 02:12:24.320]  Well, why did they put him there?
[02:12:24.320 --> 02:12:26.320]  Because he resisted what they told him to do
[02:12:26.320 --> 02:12:28.320]  He said, no, in that particular case
[02:12:28.320 --> 02:12:30.320]  They said, you can't pray for X amount of days
[02:12:30.320 --> 02:12:32.320]  Publicly
[02:12:32.320 --> 02:12:34.320]  And even privately
[02:12:34.320 --> 02:12:36.320]  And he said, no, I'm not going to do that
[02:12:36.320 --> 02:12:38.320]  I'll open my windows, I'm going to pray
[02:12:38.320 --> 02:12:40.320]  Like I do every day
[02:12:40.320 --> 02:12:42.320]  They threw him in the lion's den
[02:12:42.320 --> 02:12:44.320]  Of course God protected him
[02:12:44.320 --> 02:12:46.320]  And saved him from the lion's den
[02:12:46.320 --> 02:12:48.320]  But that's not the point
[02:12:48.320 --> 02:12:50.320]  The point really wasn't that God saved him
[02:12:50.320 --> 02:12:52.320]  From the lion's den
[02:12:52.320 --> 02:12:54.320]  The point was he was willing to go into the lion's den
[02:12:54.320 --> 02:12:56.320]  In defiance of his civil authority
[02:12:56.320 --> 02:12:58.320]  The same book you got Shadrach Meshach and Abednego
[02:12:58.320 --> 02:13:00.320]  And commanded to bow down and worship the image of the state
[02:13:00.320 --> 02:13:02.320]  They said, we can't do that
[02:13:02.320 --> 02:13:04.320]  We'll have no other gods before us
[02:13:04.320 --> 02:13:06.320]  The very first commandment
[02:13:06.320 --> 02:13:08.320]  We're not going to bow to the state
[02:13:08.320 --> 02:13:10.320]  The state is not our God
[02:13:10.320 --> 02:13:12.320]  So they threw him in the burning fiery furnace
[02:13:12.320 --> 02:13:14.320]  And again, we talk about in Sunday school
[02:13:14.320 --> 02:13:16.320]  That God delivered them from the burning fiery furnace
[02:13:16.320 --> 02:13:18.320]  But again, that's not the point
[02:13:18.320 --> 02:13:20.320]  The point is they went into the burning fiery furnace
[02:13:20.320 --> 02:13:22.320]  Why did they go in?
[02:13:22.320 --> 02:13:24.320]  Because they defied government
[02:13:24.320 --> 02:13:26.320]  They were not willing to submit their conscience
[02:13:26.320 --> 02:13:28.320]  To the authority of the state
[02:13:28.320 --> 02:13:30.320]  And this was the old terror of government
[02:13:30.320 --> 02:13:32.320]  We're going to throw you in with starving lions
[02:13:32.320 --> 02:13:34.320]  If you don't do what we say
[02:13:34.320 --> 02:13:36.320]  We're going to throw you into a smelting pit
[02:13:36.320 --> 02:13:38.320]  If you don't do what we say
[02:13:38.320 --> 02:13:40.320]  I mean the same garbage today
[02:13:40.320 --> 02:13:42.320]  Go ahead
[02:13:42.320 --> 02:13:44.320]  Yeah, even the book of judges
[02:13:44.320 --> 02:13:46.320]  People read the book of judges
[02:13:46.320 --> 02:13:48.320]  Whether it's Gideon or Samthon
[02:13:48.320 --> 02:13:50.320]  Or Jephthah or whoever it is
[02:13:50.320 --> 02:13:52.320]  Read the entire book of judges
[02:13:52.320 --> 02:13:54.320]  What do we find?
[02:13:54.320 --> 02:13:56.320]  By some oppressive regime
[02:13:56.320 --> 02:13:58.320]  And God raising up a deliverer
[02:13:58.320 --> 02:14:00.320]  Called a judge
[02:14:00.320 --> 02:14:02.320]  Sometimes they were just
[02:14:02.320 --> 02:14:04.320]  A common person
[02:14:04.320 --> 02:14:06.320]  That had no
[02:14:06.320 --> 02:14:08.320]  Particular position or authority
[02:14:08.320 --> 02:14:10.320]  But God put it on their heart
[02:14:10.320 --> 02:14:12.320]  To deliver their people from
[02:14:12.320 --> 02:14:14.320]  That tyranny that they were under
[02:14:14.320 --> 02:14:16.320]  And so they rose up, God helped them
[02:14:16.320 --> 02:14:18.320]  God gave them strength
[02:14:18.320 --> 02:14:20.320]  And they delivered the people from
[02:14:20.320 --> 02:14:22.320]  This oppressive regime
[02:14:22.320 --> 02:14:24.320]  That's what it might happen to be
[02:14:24.320 --> 02:14:26.320]  That's the entire book of judges
[02:14:26.320 --> 02:14:28.320]  You get to the New Testament
[02:14:28.320 --> 02:14:30.320]  You come to Simon Peter
[02:14:30.320 --> 02:14:32.320]  When the civil government
[02:14:32.320 --> 02:14:34.320]  Over him said, we command you
[02:14:34.320 --> 02:14:36.320]  Not to speak and preach anymore
[02:14:36.320 --> 02:14:38.320]  In his name
[02:14:38.320 --> 02:14:40.320]  And he said, sorry
[02:14:40.320 --> 02:14:42.320]  We must obey God rather than man
[02:14:42.320 --> 02:14:44.320]  And they took the cat and eye tails
[02:14:44.320 --> 02:14:46.320]  On the back for that
[02:14:46.320 --> 02:14:48.320]  Went to prison for that
[02:14:48.320 --> 02:14:50.320]  But they said no
[02:14:50.320 --> 02:14:52.320]  Same thing with Paul
[02:14:52.320 --> 02:14:54.320]  Fast forward
[02:14:54.320 --> 02:14:56.320]  70 years later
[02:14:56.320 --> 02:14:58.320]  100 years later
[02:14:58.320 --> 02:15:00.320]  Being burned at the stake in the arena
[02:15:00.320 --> 02:15:02.320]  Being thrown to lions because they wouldn't
[02:15:02.320 --> 02:15:04.320]  It's the entire Bible
[02:15:04.320 --> 02:15:06.320]  And that shows you just how
[02:15:06.320 --> 02:15:08.320]  Deceived or openly wicked
[02:15:08.320 --> 02:15:10.320]  Most of these little devils are
[02:15:10.320 --> 02:15:12.320]  Up there on the pulpit
[02:15:12.320 --> 02:15:14.320]  These are little demons
[02:15:14.320 --> 02:15:16.320]  A lot of them have been
[02:15:16.320 --> 02:15:18.320]  Up
[02:15:18.320 --> 02:15:20.320]  They have been to see
[02:15:20.320 --> 02:15:22.320]  They've been taught it
[02:15:22.320 --> 02:15:24.320]  In seminary or Bible college
[02:15:24.320 --> 02:15:26.320]  It's the accepted
[02:15:26.320 --> 02:15:28.320]  Doctrine to teach
[02:15:28.320 --> 02:15:30.320]  They haven't thought it through
[02:15:30.320 --> 02:15:32.320]  Some of them are demons, they are
[02:15:32.320 --> 02:15:34.320]  But some of them are just to see
[02:15:34.320 --> 02:15:36.320]  They just don't know any better
[02:15:36.320 --> 02:15:38.320]  That's what they were taught
[02:15:38.320 --> 02:15:40.320]  And they haven't studied it through for themselves
[02:15:40.320 --> 02:15:42.320]  And that's why Tim and I wrote the book
[02:15:42.320 --> 02:15:44.320]  Tim again is my constitutional attorney son
[02:15:44.320 --> 02:15:46.320]  And we collaborated on this
[02:15:46.320 --> 02:15:48.320]  By the way, can I get my website so people can get a hold of it
[02:15:48.320 --> 02:15:50.320]  Absolutely, in fact, I was about to get to that
[02:15:50.320 --> 02:15:52.320]  Go ahead
[02:15:52.320 --> 02:15:54.320]  You can't get it in bookstores
[02:15:54.320 --> 02:15:56.320]  It's chuckbald1live.com
[02:15:56.320 --> 02:15:58.320]  That's chuckbald1live
[02:15:58.320 --> 02:16:00.320]  All one word, l-i-v-e dot com
[02:16:00.320 --> 02:16:02.320]  And it's very easy
[02:16:02.320 --> 02:16:04.320]  You can see the links and you can click on it
[02:16:04.320 --> 02:16:06.320]  Order online, etc
[02:16:06.320 --> 02:16:08.320]  But that's why we wrote this book
[02:16:08.320 --> 02:16:10.320]  Is because of this indoctrination
[02:16:10.320 --> 02:16:12.320]  That's going on out there
[02:16:12.320 --> 02:16:14.320]  And the introduction with the 501c3
[02:16:14.320 --> 02:16:16.320]  Corporation status of churches
[02:16:16.320 --> 02:16:18.320]  Has completely neutered the pulpits
[02:16:18.320 --> 02:16:20.320]  That's why they won't take a stand
[02:16:20.320 --> 02:16:22.320]  And these people that are listening out there
[02:16:22.320 --> 02:16:24.320]  And all denominations of people
[02:16:24.320 --> 02:16:26.320]  Are listening right now
[02:16:26.320 --> 02:16:28.320]  And you go to church on Sunday and you come back
[02:16:28.320 --> 02:16:30.320]  And you say to Alex on the phone
[02:16:30.320 --> 02:16:32.320]  Or you say to your friends
[02:16:32.320 --> 02:16:34.320]  Why doesn't my preacher take a stand
[02:16:34.320 --> 02:16:36.320]  Why won't he talk about this
[02:16:36.320 --> 02:16:38.320]  Why doesn't he get involved in this
[02:16:38.320 --> 02:16:40.320]  This is why
[02:16:40.320 --> 02:16:42.320]  Every tax exempt status
[02:16:42.320 --> 02:16:44.320]  By the way, our Liberty Fellowship here in Montana
[02:16:44.320 --> 02:16:46.320]  Is not a 501c3 fellowship
[02:16:46.320 --> 02:16:48.320]  By the way, it didn't exist
[02:16:48.320 --> 02:16:50.320]  Until the 50s
[02:16:50.320 --> 02:16:52.320]  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment
[02:16:52.320 --> 02:16:54.320]  Of religion prohibiting the free exercise thereof
[02:16:54.320 --> 02:16:56.320]  Or the freedom of the press on and on
[02:16:56.320 --> 02:16:58.320]  First amendment, they said
[02:16:58.320 --> 02:17:00.320]  Oh, you can still be
[02:17:00.320 --> 02:17:02.320]  A church that's tax exempt
[02:17:02.320 --> 02:17:04.320]  Outside of law because we can't
[02:17:04.320 --> 02:17:06.320]  Put a law on you, we have no jurisdiction
[02:17:06.320 --> 02:17:08.320]  Back to what you were talking about earlier
[02:17:08.320 --> 02:17:10.320]  Or you can be a charitable organization
[02:17:10.320 --> 02:17:12.320]  And the big denominations
[02:17:12.320 --> 02:17:14.320]  Ordered all their churches to file under it
[02:17:14.320 --> 02:17:16.320]  And now the charitable organization
[02:17:16.320 --> 02:17:18.320]  Has no free speech
[02:17:18.320 --> 02:17:20.320]  When it doesn't get any clearer than the first amendment
[02:17:20.320 --> 02:17:22.320]  Congress shall make no law
[02:17:22.320 --> 02:17:24.320]  Respecting the establishment
[02:17:24.320 --> 02:17:26.320]  Of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof
[02:17:26.320 --> 02:17:28.320]  Or the press
[02:17:28.320 --> 02:17:30.320]  Or the people
[02:17:30.320 --> 02:17:32.320]  To peaceably assemble
[02:17:32.320 --> 02:17:34.320]  I mean, it just goes on and on
[02:17:34.320 --> 02:17:36.320]  Read the first amendment, it's all right there
[02:17:36.320 --> 02:17:38.320]  And now I've had friends
[02:17:38.320 --> 02:17:40.320]  Come to me from their Baptist churches
[02:17:40.320 --> 02:17:42.320]  Their Catholic churches
[02:17:42.320 --> 02:17:44.320]  You name it
[02:17:44.320 --> 02:17:46.320]  Mormons have sent me the letters
[02:17:46.320 --> 02:17:48.320]  Just across the board
[02:17:48.320 --> 02:17:50.320]  They are told, do not even talk
[02:17:50.320 --> 02:17:52.320]  About politics or your views
[02:17:52.320 --> 02:17:54.320]  Even at church or at any church function
[02:17:54.320 --> 02:17:56.320]  I mean, they're even telling now
[02:17:56.320 --> 02:17:58.320]  Their flocks don't have free speech
[02:17:58.320 --> 02:18:00.320]  I mean, these are like Soviet cults
[02:18:00.320 --> 02:18:02.320]  Yeah, the fear
[02:18:02.320 --> 02:18:04.320]  Of losing their tax exempt status
[02:18:04.320 --> 02:18:06.320]  Is what's
[02:18:06.320 --> 02:18:08.320]  Causing that
[02:18:08.320 --> 02:18:10.320]  And Romans chapter 13
[02:18:10.320 --> 02:18:12.320]  In the erroneous interpretation of that passage
[02:18:12.320 --> 02:18:14.320]  Is giving them the spiritual justification
[02:18:14.320 --> 02:18:16.320]  For it
[02:18:16.320 --> 02:18:18.320]  That's the double tandem
[02:18:18.320 --> 02:18:20.320]  That is destroying America
[02:18:20.320 --> 02:18:22.320]  If we could get the churches
[02:18:22.320 --> 02:18:24.320]  And the preachers to stand up
[02:18:24.320 --> 02:18:26.320]  For the biblical principles of liberty
[02:18:26.320 --> 02:18:28.320]  The same kind of principles
[02:18:28.320 --> 02:18:30.320]  That Jonas Clark
[02:18:30.320 --> 02:18:32.320]  He was the pastor of the church at Lexington
[02:18:32.320 --> 02:18:34.320]  On April 19, 1775
[02:18:34.320 --> 02:18:36.320]  When the British troops came marching
[02:18:36.320 --> 02:18:38.320]  Through to do two things
[02:18:38.320 --> 02:18:40.320]  They were going to arrest John Adams
[02:18:40.320 --> 02:18:42.320]  Excuse me, Sam Adams
[02:18:42.320 --> 02:18:44.320]  And John Hancock
[02:18:44.320 --> 02:18:46.320]  And they were going to seize the cash
[02:18:46.320 --> 02:18:48.320]  Of firearms that was stored
[02:18:48.320 --> 02:18:50.320]  At Concord
[02:18:50.320 --> 02:18:52.320]  And when they got to Lexington it was
[02:18:52.320 --> 02:18:54.320]  Pastor Jonas Clark and the congregants
[02:18:54.320 --> 02:18:56.320]  The male congregants of his church
[02:18:56.320 --> 02:18:58.320]  That were the Minutemen
[02:18:58.320 --> 02:19:00.320]  That fired the shot heard around the world
[02:19:00.320 --> 02:19:02.320]  And the war for independence began
[02:19:02.320 --> 02:19:04.320]  In the United States
[02:19:04.320 --> 02:19:06.320]  And that was the kind of spirit
[02:19:06.320 --> 02:19:08.320]  That the black regiment preachers
[02:19:08.320 --> 02:19:10.320]  All
[02:19:10.320 --> 02:19:12.320]  Personified
[02:19:12.320 --> 02:19:14.320]  Back at that time
[02:19:14.320 --> 02:19:16.320]  They all understood this
[02:19:16.320 --> 02:19:18.320]  I mean if we had this erroneous,
[02:19:18.320 --> 02:19:20.320]  The lacious interpretation of Romans 13
[02:19:20.320 --> 02:19:22.320]  In the colonies
[02:19:22.320 --> 02:19:24.320]  Like we have today in America
[02:19:24.320 --> 02:19:26.320]  We would still be a crown colony
[02:19:26.320 --> 02:19:28.320]  Of Great Britain
[02:19:28.320 --> 02:19:30.320]  There was a hundred years ago
[02:19:30.320 --> 02:19:32.320]  First thing targeted the takeover
[02:19:32.320 --> 02:19:34.320]  Of the churches and the teaching of Romans 13
[02:19:34.320 --> 02:19:36.320]  I mean they knew
[02:19:36.320 --> 02:19:38.320]  They had to get rid of real Christianity
[02:19:38.320 --> 02:19:40.320]  In this country and they replaced it
[02:19:40.320 --> 02:19:42.320]  With all these gold little shiny
[02:19:42.320 --> 02:19:44.320]  Glitterbug
[02:19:44.320 --> 02:19:46.320]  People in fancy
[02:19:46.320 --> 02:19:48.320]  Outfits with pink wigs on
[02:19:48.320 --> 02:19:50.320]  Acting like clowns on purpose
[02:19:50.320 --> 02:19:52.320]  I mean that is all
[02:19:52.320 --> 02:19:54.320]  By design ladies and gentlemen
[02:19:54.320 --> 02:19:56.320]  It was the Christians
[02:19:56.320 --> 02:19:58.320]  George back to England
[02:19:58.320 --> 02:20:00.320]  We'll be right back with Chuck Balvin

[02:23:58.800 --> 02:24:06.400]  By the way, I'm going to tell you more about what's happening in courtside.
[02:24:06.400 --> 02:24:09.360]  There's been some new developments there coming up in the next segment, but the Attorney
[02:24:09.360 --> 02:24:13.880]  General of the state has said preliminarily it looks like what's going on there is illegal.
[02:24:13.880 --> 02:24:14.880]  No kidding.
[02:24:14.880 --> 02:24:15.880]  Here's the headline.
[02:24:15.880 --> 02:24:20.920]  The Attorney General declared state of emergency, police chief takes power.
[02:24:20.920 --> 02:24:23.520]  Police chief, you're a fired man.
[02:24:23.520 --> 02:24:27.120]  Everybody says, oh, we bow down to Supreme Leader.
[02:24:27.120 --> 02:24:28.760]  Chuck Baldwin is our guest.
[02:24:28.760 --> 02:24:30.680]  Look, humans haven't changed.
[02:24:30.680 --> 02:24:32.180]  We act the same.
[02:24:32.180 --> 02:24:35.520]  And if you lay down the tyranny, it is going to run over you.
[02:24:35.520 --> 02:24:40.000]  To the point of the most cases, it just starts killing everybody because they're like, well,
[02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:41.000]  no one's resisting us.
[02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:42.000]  Well, then kill them.
[02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:44.600]  I must continue to dominate.
[02:24:44.600 --> 02:24:45.840]  It's wicked.
[02:24:45.840 --> 02:24:48.480]  Jenny in Florida, you're on the air with Pastor Chuck Baldwin.
[02:24:48.480 --> 02:24:49.480]  Go ahead.

[02:24:51.480 --> 02:24:52.480]  Go ahead, Jenny.
[02:24:52.480 --> 02:24:53.480]  Hi, Alex.
[02:24:53.480 --> 02:24:54.480]  How you doing?
[02:24:54.480 --> 02:24:55.480]  Good.
[02:24:55.480 --> 02:24:56.480]  Welcome.
[02:24:56.480 --> 02:25:00.440]  First of all, I want to say thank you for everything that you do while you're done.
[02:25:00.440 --> 02:25:01.440]  Thank you.
[02:25:01.440 --> 02:25:07.960]  But my feel is everybody is going to the bad way.
[02:25:07.960 --> 02:25:11.520]  Everybody's going to fix a problem that we have today.
[02:25:11.520 --> 02:25:18.600]  We have to fix a problem we have in the past first, and it's so much easier.
[02:25:18.600 --> 02:25:23.240]  And believe me, we have a very deep secret in the past.
[02:25:23.240 --> 02:25:25.400]  Could you follow me?
[02:25:25.400 --> 02:25:26.400]  Yeah.
[02:25:26.400 --> 02:25:27.400]  Now, I hear you.
[02:25:27.400 --> 02:25:28.400]  We have a deep secret in the past.
[02:25:28.400 --> 02:25:30.800]  Well, we're talking about how our churches have been turned into basically government
[02:25:30.800 --> 02:25:31.800]  arms.
[02:25:31.800 --> 02:25:34.760]  Do you have a question or comment for Chuck Baldwin or what's the secret?
[02:25:34.760 --> 02:25:37.560]  No, a secret.
[02:25:37.560 --> 02:25:42.440]  You believe we're not SBB so strange, but I decoded Leonardo da Vinci.
[02:25:42.440 --> 02:25:44.120]  I decoded our whole thing.
[02:25:44.120 --> 02:25:46.000]  Well, listen, send me that information.
[02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:47.840]  That's very interesting.
[02:25:47.840 --> 02:25:50.760]  Send me that information at showtipsandinfowords.com.
[02:25:50.760 --> 02:25:51.760]  Thank you.
[02:25:51.760 --> 02:25:55.040]  I know there's supposedly a lot of stuff encoded in there, and that's a big field out there.
[02:25:55.040 --> 02:25:56.480]  Ryan in Texas, you're on there with Chuck Baldwin.
[02:25:56.480 --> 02:25:57.480]  We've got to move quick.
[02:25:57.480 --> 02:25:58.480]  Go ahead, Ryan.
[02:25:58.480 --> 02:25:59.480]  All right.
[02:25:59.480 --> 02:26:01.480]  I just got a 20-second comment I want to make.
[02:26:01.480 --> 02:26:04.480]  We should look at the drug report and they said that we're the criminals and terrorists.
[02:26:04.480 --> 02:26:07.680]  We're real criminals and terrorists are the puppets that are in the office that are voting
[02:26:07.680 --> 02:26:09.200]  for these unconstitutional bills.
[02:26:09.200 --> 02:26:12.480]  If you voted for the Patriot Act and or it's real, criminal.
[02:26:12.480 --> 02:26:14.480]  The Super Congress, criminal.
[02:26:14.480 --> 02:26:15.480]  Banks, criminals.
[02:26:15.480 --> 02:26:17.480]  And see, if I feel for my company, are you fired?
[02:26:17.480 --> 02:26:19.480]  They're still from the country and they're retiring.
[02:26:19.480 --> 02:26:22.880]  You know, there's cameras on every corner acting like I'm a criminal, while they're
[02:26:22.880 --> 02:26:24.880]  live on camera being criminals.
[02:26:24.880 --> 02:26:28.480]  I don't want to wait until next November for a change.
[02:26:28.480 --> 02:26:30.480]  We need to arrest these criminals now.
[02:26:30.480 --> 02:26:33.480]  We have to tie this minority, and I don't want to just impeach the president.
[02:26:33.480 --> 02:26:35.480]  We need to impeach all these criminals.
[02:26:35.480 --> 02:26:37.480]  Do you want a Super Congress?
[02:26:37.480 --> 02:26:39.480]  I want a Super Impeachment.
[02:26:39.480 --> 02:26:40.480]  Very well said.
[02:26:40.480 --> 02:26:41.480]  Thank you for the call, Ryan.
[02:26:41.480 --> 02:26:43.480]  That's a good question for you, Chuck.
[02:26:43.480 --> 02:26:47.480]  I'm sure you've seen Harry Reid call the Tea Partiers terrorist.
[02:26:47.480 --> 02:26:52.480]  The New York Times says that anybody who wants to get rid of the fellow reserve is, quote,
[02:26:52.480 --> 02:26:53.480]  Hezbollah.
[02:26:53.480 --> 02:26:56.480]  They're rebranding and saying we're not worried about Al Qaeda now.
[02:26:56.480 --> 02:26:57.480]  I told folks this was coming.
[02:26:57.480 --> 02:27:00.480]  It's particularly white males and Christians.
[02:27:00.480 --> 02:27:05.480]  And we've got all these White House memos about how great a terror attack would be to
[02:27:05.480 --> 02:27:06.480]  help them.
[02:27:06.480 --> 02:27:09.480]  We have Joe Biden saying the Tea Partier terrorist.
[02:27:09.480 --> 02:27:15.480]  They're really trial ballooning coming after people that understand that they are the criminals.
[02:27:15.480 --> 02:27:20.480]  Yeah, well, I got a little taste of that in 2008, Alex, whenever the Mayak report came
[02:27:20.480 --> 02:27:26.480]  out in the state of Missouri and identified myself and Ron Paul and Bob Barr by name.
[02:27:26.480 --> 02:27:29.480]  And, of course, you were on top of all that.
[02:27:29.480 --> 02:27:32.480]  You broke the story on that one.
[02:27:32.480 --> 02:27:38.480]  And that thing became a major debacle, an embarrassment for the law enforcement officials
[02:27:38.480 --> 02:27:43.480]  in the state of Missouri that later rescinded the report and dismissed the man that initiated
[02:27:43.480 --> 02:27:44.480]  it.
[02:27:44.480 --> 02:27:45.480]  But the damage was done.
[02:27:45.480 --> 02:27:48.480]  And ever since then, that has been continuing.
[02:27:48.480 --> 02:27:54.480]  The Department of Homeland Security, through their fusion centers, continues to put out
[02:27:54.480 --> 02:27:55.480]  this kind of disinformation.
[02:27:55.480 --> 02:28:01.480]  I was about to say Mayak was just a regurgitated ADL federal report.
[02:28:01.480 --> 02:28:03.480]  That's exactly right, SPLC.
[02:28:03.480 --> 02:28:05.480]  And they continue.
[02:28:05.480 --> 02:28:07.480]  These reports continue.
[02:28:07.480 --> 02:28:13.480]  I promise you, everywhere you go to speak, everywhere I go to speak, and there is a report
[02:28:13.480 --> 02:28:19.480]  that appears in the computers of the local and county law enforcement officers alerting
[02:28:19.480 --> 02:28:24.480]  them to the fact that we are there identifying us as extremists, et cetera.
[02:28:24.480 --> 02:28:29.480]  And I'm not just saying that by hearsay, I actually saw a police computer report one
[02:28:29.480 --> 02:28:33.480]  time when I invited Dr. Greg Dixon to come and speak to my church.
[02:28:33.480 --> 02:28:37.480]  A great man of God, the former pastor of Indianapolis Baptist Temple in Indianapolis, Indiana,
[02:28:37.480 --> 02:28:42.480]  that was seized by the IRS, the only church in America to do so.
[02:28:42.480 --> 02:28:49.480]  And whenever he came to speak, Deputy Sheriff let me see the computer in his car alerting
[02:28:49.480 --> 02:28:52.480]  him to Dr. Dixon's presence in my church.
[02:28:52.480 --> 02:28:57.480]  Now that came from DHS through the Fusion Center into the local and county law enforcement.
[02:28:57.480 --> 02:28:58.480]  Oh, yeah.
[02:28:58.480 --> 02:29:00.480]  That's who they're watching when they get the Christmas Day underwear bomber.
[02:29:00.480 --> 02:29:04.480]  The government admits they got him on the plane all staged and we're all the locky hanging
[02:29:04.480 --> 02:29:06.480]  out secretly at the Pentagon, Fox News.
[02:29:06.480 --> 02:29:12.480]  But I got sent a secret report from the Army that at my events for in the Fed and Ron Paul's,
[02:29:12.480 --> 02:29:14.480]  they have Army there.
[02:29:14.480 --> 02:29:16.480]  And it says, don't let them know your Army.
[02:29:16.480 --> 02:29:18.480]  They'll try to kill you.
[02:29:18.480 --> 02:29:21.480]  I mean, they're telling the military that if you come to an in the Fed rally, we find out
[02:29:21.480 --> 02:29:22.480]  their military.
[02:29:22.480 --> 02:29:27.480]  We're going to kill them, Pastor, like we're like we're vampires or something.
[02:29:27.480 --> 02:29:28.480]  Yeah.
[02:29:28.480 --> 02:29:30.480]  That's what has come to it again.
[02:29:30.480 --> 02:29:31.480]  My room is 13th.
[02:29:31.480 --> 02:29:32.480]  Look, is it chuckball?
[02:29:32.480 --> 02:29:33.480]  Stay there.
[02:29:33.480 --> 02:29:34.480]  Let's play it on the other side.
[02:29:34.480 --> 02:29:36.480]  Do a few more minutes and take a few more calls.
[02:29:36.480 --> 02:29:37.480]  Absolutely, folks.
[02:29:37.480 --> 02:29:39.480]  That's why we've got him here today.
[02:29:39.480 --> 02:29:42.480]  We'll give you his website on the other side.
[02:29:42.480 --> 02:29:45.480]  If you want to get it, get it out to your pastor.
[02:29:45.480 --> 02:29:50.480]  And if your pastor reads it and still keeps going forward, get out of that church.
[02:29:50.480 --> 02:29:52.480]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.480 --> 02:29:54.480]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.480 --> 02:30:21.480]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[02:30:25.480 --> 02:30:29.480]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:30:29.480 --> 02:30:32.480]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:30:32.480 --> 02:30:36.480]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[02:30:36.480 --> 02:30:41.480]  Number five, a solar-powered generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:30:41.480 --> 02:30:45.480]  Folks, I really believe in the solar-powered generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[02:30:45.480 --> 02:30:46.480]  one of my old sponsors.
[02:30:46.480 --> 02:30:50.480]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:30:50.480 --> 02:30:52.480]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:30:52.480 --> 02:30:56.480]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com
[02:30:56.480 --> 02:31:01.480]  or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:31:01.480 --> 02:31:05.480]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:31:05.480 --> 02:31:09.480]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:31:09.480 --> 02:31:14.480]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:31:14.480 --> 02:31:18.480]  I have tremendous influence on our president and Congress,
[02:31:18.480 --> 02:31:20.480]  and they really are calling the shots.
[02:31:20.480 --> 02:31:25.480]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:31:25.480 --> 02:31:28.480]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[02:31:28.480 --> 02:31:32.480]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[02:31:32.480 --> 02:31:35.480]  and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:31:35.480 --> 02:31:37.480]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[02:31:37.480 --> 02:31:40.480]  They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying,
[02:31:40.480 --> 02:31:41.480]  who do we make the check out to?
[02:31:41.480 --> 02:31:43.480]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:31:43.480 --> 02:31:48.480]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:31:48.480 --> 02:31:53.480]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[02:31:53.480 --> 02:32:19.480]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[02:32:23.480 --> 02:32:48.480]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[02:32:48.480 --> 02:33:14.480]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[02:33:18.480 --> 02:33:29.480]  Okay, I'm gonna go quicker through your calls and recap some of the incredible news from earlier
[02:33:29.480 --> 02:33:32.480]  and some of the news we haven't gotten to in a little bit on court side.
[02:33:32.480 --> 02:33:36.480]  But I wanted Chuck Baldwin to finish plugging the name of his book,
[02:33:36.480 --> 02:33:37.480]  where you get it.
[02:33:37.480 --> 02:33:42.480]  And again, it's just like we had Sheriff Richard Mack in here last week
[02:33:42.480 --> 02:33:44.480]  and we're like, go to his website, get his book.
[02:33:44.480 --> 02:33:45.480]  I'm not being paid to promote it.
[02:33:45.480 --> 02:33:47.480]  I've got him here because I believe in it.
[02:33:47.480 --> 02:33:50.480]  If we go wake up our sheriffs about the Constitution,
[02:33:50.480 --> 02:33:53.480]  wake up the pastors about their true role in history,
[02:33:53.480 --> 02:33:58.480]  if we go and educate our city councils, our legislatures about the Constitution,
[02:33:58.480 --> 02:34:01.480]  what do the globalists do?
[02:34:01.480 --> 02:34:03.480]  What do the feds do?
[02:34:03.480 --> 02:34:05.480]  I mean, I knew about this decades ago,
[02:34:05.480 --> 02:34:12.480]  but now I've learned they've more than tripled the number of Federal Reserve-paid speakers
[02:34:12.480 --> 02:34:17.480]  who will be heads of city governments, corporate leaders.
[02:34:17.480 --> 02:34:20.480]  They're paid to go speak to high school classes.
[02:34:20.480 --> 02:34:22.480]  They're paid to go speak to colleges.
[02:34:22.480 --> 02:34:24.480]  They're paid to go to the Rotary Club.
[02:34:24.480 --> 02:34:27.480]  And they will pay top lawyers, famous people,
[02:34:27.480 --> 02:34:31.480]  and they've just got a huge army of them to go be there,
[02:34:31.480 --> 02:34:36.480]  to go meet them, to go slickly sell what they're doing.
[02:34:36.480 --> 02:34:38.480]  So you're not gonna beat the New World Order by yourself.
[02:34:38.480 --> 02:34:44.480]  I'm not either, but it's all of us out there waking people up everywhere.
[02:34:44.480 --> 02:34:47.480]  I call it evangelizing for liberty and freedom
[02:34:47.480 --> 02:34:51.480]  because, believe me, the tyrants are out there selling their corruption.
[02:34:51.480 --> 02:34:54.480]  So again, give folks your website and the name of the book
[02:34:54.480 --> 02:34:57.480]  so folks can get it, Pastor.
[02:34:57.480 --> 02:34:58.480]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[02:34:58.480 --> 02:35:03.480]  My son and I, Tim Baldwin, and he's a constitutional attorney.
[02:35:03.480 --> 02:35:05.480]  Of course, I've been a pastor for 35 years.
[02:35:05.480 --> 02:35:08.480]  We collaborated on this monumental book.
[02:35:08.480 --> 02:35:11.480]  It's called Romans 13, The True Meaning of Submission.
[02:35:11.480 --> 02:35:14.480]  And it's available on my website and Tim's website.
[02:35:14.480 --> 02:35:17.480]  My website is chuckbaldwinlive.com.
[02:35:17.480 --> 02:35:23.480]  That's all one word. Chuckbaldwinlive.com.
[02:35:23.480 --> 02:35:26.480]  And there's a link right there on the front page.
[02:35:26.480 --> 02:35:28.480]  You see it advertised. Just click that.
[02:35:28.480 --> 02:35:33.480]  You can get it online, credit cards, et cetera, and able to pick this up.
[02:35:33.480 --> 02:35:36.480]  And it's just under 200 pages.
[02:35:36.480 --> 02:35:41.480]  It's chuckful of scripture references from both testaments.
[02:35:41.480 --> 02:35:45.480]  We have theologians, historians, and Christians from history
[02:35:45.480 --> 02:35:48.480]  and their comments on what they said about this subject.
[02:35:48.480 --> 02:35:52.480]  I challenge anyone to read this book
[02:35:52.480 --> 02:35:57.480]  and then not be convinced that we have a sacred obligation
[02:35:57.480 --> 02:36:01.480]  to resist evil authority.
[02:36:01.480 --> 02:36:04.480]  And by the way, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:36:04.480 --> 02:36:06.480]  I was going to say, Brisbane Franklin said,
[02:36:06.480 --> 02:36:09.480]  rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:36:09.480 --> 02:36:11.480]  And he was exactly right.
[02:36:11.480 --> 02:36:13.480]  That is a scriptural truism.
[02:36:13.480 --> 02:36:18.480]  That it is an obligation of Christian people to resist evil government.
[02:36:18.480 --> 02:36:21.480]  But Pastor, as you know, this is a chicken or egg situation.
[02:36:21.480 --> 02:36:23.480]  If you've really got God in your heart,
[02:36:23.480 --> 02:36:26.480]  you're not going to be able to control yourself.
[02:36:26.480 --> 02:36:30.480]  You're going to be drawn towards confronting bullies and scum.
[02:36:30.480 --> 02:36:32.480]  And I think that's the issue.
[02:36:32.480 --> 02:36:34.480]  So I think the book should be gotten out the pastors
[02:36:34.480 --> 02:36:37.480]  because maybe they're ignorant and it will certainly wake some up.
[02:36:37.480 --> 02:36:39.480]  But also it's a test.
[02:36:39.480 --> 02:36:43.480]  If your pastor reads it and then argues with you about it,
[02:36:43.480 --> 02:36:45.480]  because I've read the Bible, I've studied history.
[02:36:45.480 --> 02:36:47.480]  This is common sense. It's no brainer.
[02:36:47.480 --> 02:36:50.480]  But if they read this very well written, well researched historical document
[02:36:50.480 --> 02:36:54.480]  and they still don't listen, then you need to find a better church.
[02:36:54.480 --> 02:36:58.480]  And I think your book should be really a litmus test for churches.
[02:36:58.480 --> 02:37:00.480]  What do you say to that, Pastor Baldwin?
[02:37:00.480 --> 02:37:02.480]  Wow, I think, thank you, Alex.
[02:37:02.480 --> 02:37:03.480]  I think that's true.
[02:37:03.480 --> 02:37:06.480]  I couldn't tell how many people have read the book
[02:37:06.480 --> 02:37:08.480]  and have called us back or written us and said,
[02:37:08.480 --> 02:37:13.480]  you know what, this confirmed everything that I knew in my heart was true,
[02:37:13.480 --> 02:37:15.480]  but I didn't know where to find it in the Bible.
[02:37:15.480 --> 02:37:17.480]  I didn't know where to see it in print.
[02:37:17.480 --> 02:37:21.480]  But now I see it and they have done that very thing.
[02:37:21.480 --> 02:37:25.480]  Now I'm looking for a church that will preach the truth
[02:37:25.480 --> 02:37:28.480]  relative to this vitally important subject.
[02:37:28.480 --> 02:37:30.480]  And I know people all over America that are doing that,
[02:37:30.480 --> 02:37:32.480]  so I think that is exactly...
[02:37:32.480 --> 02:37:36.480]  If we don't start voting with our feet, we Christians,
[02:37:36.480 --> 02:37:40.480]  if we don't start voting with our feet in getting out of these churches
[02:37:40.480 --> 02:37:44.480]  that are bringing us into bondage spiritually, politically, ethically,
[02:37:44.480 --> 02:37:48.480]  and every other way and start finding true men of God out there,
[02:37:48.480 --> 02:37:52.480]  even if the church is a small little church with only 30 or 40 people in it,
[02:37:52.480 --> 02:37:56.480]  so what? Being in a church where the truth is being preached
[02:37:56.480 --> 02:38:00.480]  and God will bless your family and more than that, God will bless our nation.
[02:38:00.480 --> 02:38:02.480]  I could not agree more.
[02:38:02.480 --> 02:38:04.480]  Yeah, we got to do it.
[02:38:04.480 --> 02:38:07.480]  We've turned away from the basic principles and now look what we're getting.
[02:38:07.480 --> 02:38:10.480]  The Constitution Bill of Rights goes out the door.
[02:38:10.480 --> 02:38:12.480]  Corruption and absolute poverty comes in.
[02:38:12.480 --> 02:38:14.480]  I mean, I thought it was real simple.
[02:38:14.480 --> 02:38:17.480]  We got to get the tyranny out of here, but we got to replace it with something.
[02:38:17.480 --> 02:38:20.480]  Let's go to who's up next here.
[02:38:20.480 --> 02:38:23.480]  I'll take a few calls, then we're going to let our guests go,
[02:38:23.480 --> 02:38:25.480]  and then I'll continue with calls.
[02:38:25.480 --> 02:38:28.480]  Earl and Georgia, you're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[02:38:28.480 --> 02:38:31.480]  Yes, sir. I'm a first-time caller.
[02:38:31.480 --> 02:38:35.480]  I've listened to you for a while and I'm an admirer of Chuck Baldwin.
[02:38:35.480 --> 02:38:39.480]  I followed him on the Internet for a while.
[02:38:39.480 --> 02:38:43.480]  Off-track, though, over the last year.
[02:38:43.480 --> 02:38:49.480]  However, I guess this is a question I have directed to Chuck.
[02:38:49.480 --> 02:38:53.480]  I know your son's a constitutional lawyer,
[02:38:53.480 --> 02:38:58.480]  and the way I read the Constitution, there is a separation of powers,
[02:38:58.480 --> 02:39:05.480]  and it says that the Supreme Court is supposed to act upon the legislation that Congress passes.
[02:39:05.480 --> 02:39:09.480]  I know they've been out of control as well as every other branch,
[02:39:09.480 --> 02:39:13.480]  but your son being a constitutional lawyer,
[02:39:13.480 --> 02:39:18.480]  I am asking, I suppose, with this latest legislation that has been enacted,
[02:39:18.480 --> 02:39:28.480]  strips Congress of its power to introduce financial legislation.
[02:39:28.480 --> 02:39:31.480]  And if they don't vote for what the super committee gives them,
[02:39:31.480 --> 02:39:33.480]  then the super committee can do whatever they want.
[02:39:33.480 --> 02:39:37.480]  It is a dictatorship of 13.
[02:39:37.480 --> 02:39:41.480]  It goes about 90% of the way. I will give you a constitutional answer on that.
[02:39:41.480 --> 02:39:45.480]  Of course, the Supreme Court should be causing a fracas over this
[02:39:45.480 --> 02:39:48.480]  and pointing out that it's blatantly unconstitutional.
[02:39:48.480 --> 02:39:54.480]  But so should the vast majority of House members of both parties that voted for it.
[02:39:54.480 --> 02:40:00.480]  They voted away their power. Sorry, you can't vote away our Constitution. Chuck, your comments on that.
[02:40:00.480 --> 02:40:04.480]  Yeah, exactly right. And Tim's very involved in these types of things.
[02:40:04.480 --> 02:40:08.480]  Of course, this one here is fraught with unconstitutionality,
[02:40:08.480 --> 02:40:14.480]  and I would like to think that there's going to be several constitutional attorneys and scholars
[02:40:14.480 --> 02:40:19.480]  that are going to come forth and fight this. I certainly hope so.
[02:40:19.480 --> 02:40:24.480]  But yes, ma'am, this is brazenly unconstitutional. Any other comments?
[02:40:24.480 --> 02:40:32.480]  Well, I am just asking, as a citizen who called every body that I knew yesterday
[02:40:32.480 --> 02:40:38.480]  and also sent emails called Congressman's office and told them to vote no,
[02:40:38.480 --> 02:40:45.480]  is there anything else as citizens? Can we enact a class action suit against them?
[02:40:45.480 --> 02:40:49.480]  Well, anything will help because even if you don't win it, it draws attention to it.
[02:40:49.480 --> 02:40:53.480]  I'm telling you, resistance is victory. I appreciate your call.
[02:40:53.480 --> 02:40:57.480]  Can I just say, Alex here, go to my son's website and contact him.
[02:40:57.480 --> 02:41:02.480]  Please, his website is libertydefenseleague.com.
[02:41:02.480 --> 02:41:08.480]  All one word, libertydefenseleague.com, and feel free to communicate with him
[02:41:08.480 --> 02:41:11.480]  and ask him these questions, and he will respond to you.
[02:41:11.480 --> 02:41:13.480]  Yeah, we've got to get him back on. He's been on before. He's great.
[02:41:13.480 --> 02:41:15.480]  Almost better than his pop.
[02:41:15.480 --> 02:41:18.480]  He is. He's a Yankee term.
[02:41:18.480 --> 02:41:23.480]  Let's go ahead and talk to Kathy in Indiana. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:41:23.480 --> 02:41:29.480]  Hey, Kathy, you're on. You're up. Batter up, Kathy.
[02:41:29.480 --> 02:41:32.480]  Okay, let's move on. Sorry, Kathy.
[02:41:32.480 --> 02:41:36.480]  Oh, our phones just went down. That only happens once or twice a year.
[02:41:36.480 --> 02:41:39.480]  Oh, our phones just went into cardiac arrest. Okay, great.
[02:41:39.480 --> 02:41:42.480]  Even when I try to go to your calls.
[02:41:42.480 --> 02:41:45.480]  Yeah, yeah, Chuck's on a different phone system. Chuck, you can still hear me, can't you?
[02:41:45.480 --> 02:41:47.480]  Yeah, I can still hear you, Alex.
[02:41:47.480 --> 02:41:49.480]  All right, John, when the phones are back up, let me know.
[02:41:49.480 --> 02:41:54.480]  We'll just take calls from those folks. They can get back on and get on air.
[02:41:54.480 --> 02:41:59.480]  Thank you, Alex. Thank you for letting me be on the show. Keep up the great work.
[02:41:59.480 --> 02:42:01.480]  Are you kidding? Thanks for writing that book.
[02:42:01.480 --> 02:42:02.480]  I mean...
[02:42:02.480 --> 02:42:07.480]  Well, we want to get it out and we want people to get the message in it.
[02:42:07.480 --> 02:42:14.480]  We really believe that the Christian and the churches is where the real power is in this country.
[02:42:14.480 --> 02:42:17.480]  It's always been that way. We, the people, are the...
[02:42:17.480 --> 02:42:24.480]  are the government and we are the power in this country.
[02:42:24.480 --> 02:42:29.480]  And if you can get the pastors and the Christians to understand their obligation and their duties under God,
[02:42:29.480 --> 02:42:31.480]  and I think of that scripture verse where Jesus said,
[02:42:31.480 --> 02:42:35.480]  if the salt has lost its savor, it sends forth good for nothing,
[02:42:35.480 --> 02:42:38.480]  but to be trodden under the foot of man and cast out.
[02:42:38.480 --> 02:42:40.480]  And that's exactly what's happened.
[02:42:40.480 --> 02:42:44.480]  The church has lost its saltiness and it's being cast out
[02:42:44.480 --> 02:42:47.480]  and trodden under the foot of tyranny.
[02:42:47.480 --> 02:42:51.480]  And Romans 13 and the misinterpretation of it is one of the biggest reasons why
[02:42:51.480 --> 02:42:54.480]  this book is a major, major breakthrough, I think,
[02:42:54.480 --> 02:42:58.480]  in helping people to have the information scripturally, historically,
[02:42:58.480 --> 02:43:02.480]  at their fingertips to know how to deal with that.
[02:43:02.480 --> 02:43:05.480]  And again, if they'll go to chuckbaldwinlive.com,
[02:43:05.480 --> 02:43:08.480]  all one word, chuckbaldwinlive.com, they can order that book.
[02:43:08.480 --> 02:43:12.480]  Okay. We look forward to speaking to you again in the near future. Take care.
[02:43:12.480 --> 02:43:14.480]  All right. There he goes.
[02:43:14.480 --> 02:43:18.480]  Yeah, it is important to get those type of materials out to people.
[02:43:18.480 --> 02:43:22.480]  And then that's why this radio show exists is a platform for information
[02:43:22.480 --> 02:43:24.480]  to get it out to people.
[02:43:24.480 --> 02:43:27.480]  And that's why when you support this broadcast and our sponsors,
[02:43:27.480 --> 02:43:30.480]  you support Ron Paul, Chuck Baldwin, countless other activists,
[02:43:30.480 --> 02:43:32.480]  the folks out in court site.
[02:43:32.480 --> 02:43:35.480]  I want to go back to your calls when the phone system comes back up
[02:43:35.480 --> 02:43:37.480]  for those that were holding.
[02:43:37.480 --> 02:43:43.480]  Kathy, Chris, Ryan, V man and others 800-259-9231.
[02:43:43.480 --> 02:43:47.480]  As soon as that system comes back up, but guys actually printed
[02:43:47.480 --> 02:43:49.480]  all the court site articles. We run them into me.
[02:43:49.480 --> 02:43:51.480]  I forgot to grab them during that last break.
[02:43:51.480 --> 02:43:56.480]  But the court site council has drawn state scrutiny.
[02:43:56.480 --> 02:44:00.480]  The attorney general says that the videos they've seen,
[02:44:00.480 --> 02:44:04.480]  that it does look like they're having illegal meetings and doing illegal things.
[02:44:04.480 --> 02:44:07.480]  And now they're reviewing other videos of police chasing people
[02:44:07.480 --> 02:44:10.480]  with video cameras on the streets and trying to arrest them
[02:44:10.480 --> 02:44:13.480]  and arresting political opponents and the state police.
[02:44:13.480 --> 02:44:17.480]  So, I mean, there's no doubt this is official oppression from what I've seen
[02:44:17.480 --> 02:44:21.480]  and that there used to be, you know, the state police coming in
[02:44:21.480 --> 02:44:24.480]  and arresting these people.
[02:44:24.480 --> 02:44:28.480]  But don't hold your breath if things are going to get a lot uglier
[02:44:28.480 --> 02:44:32.480]  before that happens because the system does not want to send a message
[02:44:32.480 --> 02:44:34.480]  that governments can't do whatever they want.
[02:44:34.480 --> 02:44:38.480]  They kind of like the idea of a police chief and the city council
[02:44:38.480 --> 02:44:40.480]  firing the mayor and the police.
[02:44:40.480 --> 02:44:43.480]  They kind of like the idea of people not having free speech.
[02:44:43.480 --> 02:44:47.480]  They kind of like the idea of secret meetings and committees of 13,
[02:44:47.480 --> 02:44:51.480]  council of 13. I mean, talk about creepy.
[02:44:51.480 --> 02:44:53.480]  The globalists absolutely love it.
[02:44:53.480 --> 02:44:59.480]  So, that's the developments on that front.
[02:44:59.480 --> 02:45:03.480]  I've got some other news. I mean, to be quite frank with you,
[02:45:03.480 --> 02:45:05.480]  I'm going to be working up here until later tonight
[02:45:05.480 --> 02:45:07.480]  on the launch of the new news TV show.
[02:45:07.480 --> 02:45:09.480]  You start September 1st.
[02:45:09.480 --> 02:45:13.480]  You've seen some info or special reports that are kind of done
[02:45:13.480 --> 02:45:16.480]  in the Charlie Rose style.
[02:45:16.480 --> 02:45:22.480]  But we've got more highly produced, fast paced, jam packed 30-minute show
[02:45:22.480 --> 02:45:27.480]  that we're developing that will launch, streamed at prisonplanet.tv.
[02:45:27.480 --> 02:45:31.480]  And I've already had a lot of offers from cable channels,
[02:45:31.480 --> 02:45:37.480]  you know, systems in Europe, systems in England,
[02:45:37.480 --> 02:45:39.480]  systems in the United States.
[02:45:39.480 --> 02:45:42.480]  And quite frankly, I'm always so busy doing my own radio show
[02:45:42.480 --> 02:45:45.480]  and so busy just working on things here and doing special reports
[02:45:45.480 --> 02:45:50.480]  that I've had offers to put my show up live on, you know,
[02:45:50.480 --> 02:45:53.480]  with a live satellite uplink.
[02:45:53.480 --> 02:45:57.480]  A lot of, and I haven't even called a lot of people back,
[02:45:57.480 --> 02:46:00.480]  there are some cable systems airing this show now,
[02:46:00.480 --> 02:46:03.480]  just grabbing it off prisonplanet.tv and airing it the next day.
[02:46:03.480 --> 02:46:06.480]  And I never even really get into that stuff or talk about it.
[02:46:06.480 --> 02:46:10.480]  But you can go around and look and, you know, see examples of that happening.
[02:46:10.480 --> 02:46:14.480]  But this new highly produced show will be a 30-minute,
[02:46:14.480 --> 02:46:17.480]  it's beta tested on prisonplanet.tv,
[02:46:17.480 --> 02:46:20.480]  and then you'll get special reports on prisonplanet.tv as well
[02:46:20.480 --> 02:46:23.480]  as your support and memberships that make it possible.
[02:46:23.480 --> 02:46:28.480]  But then it will expand out on two different television systems.
[02:46:28.480 --> 02:46:31.480]  And there'll be an announcement as well at the end
[02:46:31.480 --> 02:46:34.480]  that if you would like to, you know, free to air it,
[02:46:34.480 --> 02:46:38.480]  re-air it on your local AM, FM radio station, UHF, VHF,
[02:46:38.480 --> 02:46:42.480]  cable system access station, it's just going to be a free-for-all,
[02:46:42.480 --> 02:46:43.480]  as they say.
[02:46:43.480 --> 02:46:45.480]  And so that's why we're developing.
[02:46:45.480 --> 02:46:47.480]  I've got a plan for a newspaper.
[02:46:47.480 --> 02:46:49.480]  And we're finally getting the employees in,
[02:46:49.480 --> 02:46:52.480]  train, finally always batting down other hatches
[02:46:52.480 --> 02:46:55.480]  and other problems, other things that blow up.
[02:46:55.480 --> 02:46:58.480]  But that's why your support of this show and our sponsors
[02:46:58.480 --> 02:46:59.480]  is now more important than ever.
[02:46:59.480 --> 02:47:02.480]  So please remember when you buy the books, the t-shirts, the videos,
[02:47:02.480 --> 02:47:04.480]  all of it, that makes this broadcast possible.
[02:47:04.480 --> 02:47:08.480]  Remember also our AM and FM affiliates to support their local sponsors
[02:47:08.480 --> 02:47:12.480]  as well and to support those stations or if you're a local sponsor
[02:47:12.480 --> 02:47:16.480]  to go and sponsor the show on that local station.
[02:47:16.480 --> 02:47:20.480]  Speaking of sponsors, Interfuse, a revolutionary 100% organic green
[02:47:20.480 --> 02:47:23.480]  superfood energy drink with powerful nutrition for better health,
[02:47:23.480 --> 02:47:26.480]  energy, mental clarity, and immune system support.

[02:47:34.480 --> 02:47:36.480]  It's also high in naturally occurring iodine,
[02:47:36.480 --> 02:47:38.480]  which is really good for it with all the radiation exposure.
[02:47:38.480 --> 02:47:41.480]  By the way, the reporting that there's still lethal radiation
[02:47:41.480 --> 02:47:44.480]  coming out of there in MSNBC and Fukushima.

[02:48:24.480 --> 02:48:26.480]  Okay.
[02:48:26.480 --> 02:48:29.480]  Okay, Ryan, Ryan is old because I wanted to go to folks that got kicked off.
[02:48:29.480 --> 02:48:31.480]  All right, well, whatever.
[02:48:31.480 --> 02:48:33.480]  Ryan in Missouri here on the air, go ahead.
[02:48:33.480 --> 02:48:35.480]  Yes, sir. Hi, how are you?
[02:48:35.480 --> 02:48:37.480]  Good, thanks for calling.
[02:48:37.480 --> 02:48:40.480]  I'm calling to try to bring up some of that scene
[02:48:40.480 --> 02:48:43.480]  or hurt on the television the other day.
[02:48:43.480 --> 02:48:46.480]  They're wanting to call, they're wanting us to call our local congressman
[02:48:46.480 --> 02:48:50.480]  or woman to let them know that they're going to be dropping local broadcasting.
[02:48:50.480 --> 02:48:52.480]  Are you aware of that?
[02:48:52.480 --> 02:48:58.480]  What did big networks are going to get rid of local broadcasting altogether?
[02:48:58.480 --> 02:49:01.480]  Right, that's the way I interpreted it.
[02:49:01.480 --> 02:49:05.480]  Well, I know there's been a move in consolidation
[02:49:05.480 --> 02:49:08.480]  to play from really any local programming,
[02:49:08.480 --> 02:49:10.480]  which is not just about profits.
[02:49:10.480 --> 02:49:13.480]  They've actually showed local programming.
[02:49:13.480 --> 02:49:16.480]  If you'll do it for a while becomes the most profitable thing.
[02:49:16.480 --> 02:49:19.480]  And so, yeah, these big mega corporations, though,
[02:49:19.480 --> 02:49:23.480]  they run monopoly systems where they don't even really let competition get in.
[02:49:23.480 --> 02:49:27.480]  Some of the bigger network outfits will give you basically free advertising
[02:49:27.480 --> 02:49:31.480]  for a year or, you know, 95% off until they bankrupted all the other stations.
[02:49:31.480 --> 02:49:34.480]  And then they're the only game in town.
[02:49:34.480 --> 02:49:35.480]  And I think it's wrong.
[02:49:35.480 --> 02:49:37.480]  I mean, I think we should go back to where, you know,
[02:49:37.480 --> 02:49:41.480]  one outfit shouldn't be able to own, you know, half the stations in the country.
[02:49:41.480 --> 02:49:46.480]  And I know that there are more and more getting away from local broadcasting.
[02:49:46.480 --> 02:49:49.480]  And of course, that's the big no-no in syndicated broadcasting is to talk about that,
[02:49:49.480 --> 02:49:50.480]  but I don't care.
[02:49:50.480 --> 02:49:52.480]  I'm going to tell the truth. That's the end of it.
[02:49:52.480 --> 02:49:55.480]  I'm too lazy to lie. Telling the truth is super easy.
[02:49:55.480 --> 02:49:57.480]  You don't have to think about what I'm going to say.
[02:49:57.480 --> 02:50:02.480]  But, I mean, are you talking about radio or VHF, UHF?
[02:50:02.480 --> 02:50:05.480]  I know they're all moving away from it.
[02:50:05.480 --> 02:50:08.480]  Right. No, I'm talking mostly, uh, it was on television.
[02:50:08.480 --> 02:50:09.480]  And that's why interpret it.
[02:50:09.480 --> 02:50:12.480]  I thought it was the television broadcasting networks that were going to be dropping local.
[02:50:12.480 --> 02:50:16.480]  Oh yeah. 10, 15 years ago, local TV station people thought they were rock stars.
[02:50:16.480 --> 02:50:20.480]  Now they're disheveled and can't even, you know, buy a cup of coffee.
[02:50:20.480 --> 02:50:21.480]  But yeah, they're getting rid of it all.
[02:50:21.480 --> 02:50:23.480]  What do you think of that?
[02:50:23.480 --> 02:50:25.480]  Well, I understand. I mean, I understand all that.
[02:50:25.480 --> 02:50:27.480]  I don't usually watch the local news.
[02:50:27.480 --> 02:50:30.480]  I usually get it on the internet from your show or satellite radio.
[02:50:30.480 --> 02:50:35.480]  But, uh, my, my, you know, my biggest issue that was, what that was, was, you know,
[02:50:35.480 --> 02:50:41.480]  rogue, uh, um, broadcasters, you know, being able to just tell people or advise them,
[02:50:41.480 --> 02:50:46.480]  you know, against maybe the, the major propaganda machine, uh, direction.
[02:50:46.480 --> 02:50:49.480]  You know, they just get on there and say, hey, you're getting overtaken.
[02:50:49.480 --> 02:50:53.480]  Uh, or we are getting under, oversteed or whatever.
[02:50:53.480 --> 02:50:56.480]  And, you know, it's always good to have extra avenues to get information.
[02:50:56.480 --> 02:50:58.480]  No, I agree. I'm all for local.
[02:50:58.480 --> 02:51:00.480]  Uh, people should support local.
[02:51:00.480 --> 02:51:29.480]  Right back.
[02:51:30.480 --> 02:51:59.480]  Thank you.

[02:53:06.480 --> 02:53:08.480]  The market is in for another crash.
[02:53:08.480 --> 02:53:10.480]  Real estate is already in a double dip recession.

[02:53:20.480 --> 02:53:26.480]  I searched and discovered a way to safely grow my money, participate in potential double digit gains,
[02:53:26.480 --> 02:53:29.480]  but also have my money protected when the crashes come.
[02:53:29.480 --> 02:53:32.480]  Plus, it could save you thousands in taxes.

[02:53:59.480 --> 02:54:01.480]  Thank you.
[02:54:30.480 --> 02:54:35.480]  Alright, The Man in Ohio. Thanks for getting back in when our phone system went down.
[02:54:35.480 --> 02:54:38.480]  Welcome. What's on your mind today?
[02:54:38.480 --> 02:54:42.480]  Hey, Alex Megadiddos. I really appreciate what you're doing.
[02:54:42.480 --> 02:54:48.480]  You really inspired me to go out and do something after figuring out, you know, everything that's going on out here.
[02:54:48.480 --> 02:54:53.480]  But my question is, you know, I'm out there protesting and I feel like I'm targeting you,
[02:54:53.480 --> 02:55:01.480]  the immediate target of, you know, this police state tyranny and I'm out in front of the police station.
[02:55:01.480 --> 02:55:06.480]  And, you know, I'm calling them Nazi thugs and I'm equating them with the TSA.
[02:55:06.480 --> 02:55:11.480]  And, you know, they all been violating our rights all on the streets and everything for a long time.
[02:55:11.480 --> 02:55:18.480]  And I still have people that come up to me. I believe in God, you know, and I believe in what the pastor was saying.
[02:55:18.480 --> 02:55:24.480]  And I feel that spirit of rebellion in my heart and it drives me to go out there and do something.
[02:55:24.480 --> 02:55:32.480]  And I just wanted to know, like, you know, I talked to the Cuyahoga County Sheriff's and Cleveland Police and it just seems like they really don't care.
[02:55:32.480 --> 02:55:38.480]  You know, and I called my council members and I've called the state house and everything and you just get the same filibuster in.
[02:55:38.480 --> 02:55:45.480]  No, that's it. And again, when the police run warrantless checkpoints, when they, I've seen the video in Ohio,
[02:55:45.480 --> 02:55:51.480]  threatened to blow the guy's head off because he's a concealed carry guy and they pull him over and he says,
[02:55:51.480 --> 02:55:53.480]  officer, I'm going to tell you, and he goes, shut up.
[02:55:53.480 --> 02:55:57.480]  In a minute later, he goes, I got to tell you something, shut up or I'm going to beat you.
[02:55:57.480 --> 02:56:00.480]  And the guy's like, okay, and he finally gets him out of the car.
[02:56:00.480 --> 02:56:05.480]  He goes, I have a concealed carry. The cop flips out and for like 10 minutes says, I ought to murder you.
[02:56:05.480 --> 02:56:08.480]  I had to blow your head off for not telling me that.
[02:56:08.480 --> 02:56:11.480]  And he said to me, you told me to shut up and he's so polite.
[02:56:11.480 --> 02:56:18.480]  And the point is they don't even get in trouble and then they make all the other good officers look bad because the tyrants want bad officers.
[02:56:18.480 --> 02:56:26.480]  But when the police act like this, they are acting like Nazis or Soviets because that or Guatemalan police or North Korean police,
[02:56:26.480 --> 02:56:31.480]  everybody knows that in third world countries and places, the police are bad.
[02:56:31.480 --> 02:56:36.480]  I mean, no one denies that. Well, then our police are bad when they act like third world police.
[02:56:36.480 --> 02:56:42.480]  I mean, it's real simple. But then there's this attitude of never criticize cops and believe the cop shows.
[02:56:42.480 --> 02:56:45.480]  You know, they're all heroes. I mean, I'm sorry.
[02:56:45.480 --> 02:56:50.480]  Where I grew up, the cops were the drug dealers. And thank God I wasn't a drug user.
[02:56:50.480 --> 02:56:53.480]  I would just be at a party and here's the cops delivering drugs and I'd get out of there.
[02:56:53.480 --> 02:56:56.480]  You know, growing up in the 80s, the drugs were ubiquitous.
[02:56:56.480 --> 02:56:58.480]  Then we moved down here to get away with it.
[02:56:58.480 --> 02:57:02.480]  But, you know, just keep moving forward, keep warning people.
[02:57:02.480 --> 02:57:07.480]  Ohio is, I've got a crew member, you know, lived there for a long time.
[02:57:07.480 --> 02:57:14.480]  It's just particular, particularly kind of brain dead.
[02:57:14.480 --> 02:57:21.480]  You know, I'm not saying stupid, but just we see a lot of wild stuff up there.
[02:57:21.480 --> 02:57:25.480]  I'm just wondering, I'm scared. It scares me.
[02:57:25.480 --> 02:57:28.480]  All of this scares me. It makes me want to do something about it.
[02:57:28.480 --> 02:57:32.480]  I don't want to act out violently. You know, I just don't want to do that.
[02:57:32.480 --> 02:57:36.480]  I don't want to nobody pointing a finger at us and saying we started anything.
[02:57:36.480 --> 02:57:39.480]  Well, look at the end of the day, what's going to happen is going to happen.
[02:57:39.480 --> 02:57:47.480]  We just wake up as many people as you can realize that the system knows that they've been evil.
[02:57:47.480 --> 02:57:49.480]  So they're trying to stonewall us real arrogant.
[02:57:49.480 --> 02:57:53.480]  But in the end, they're going to fall like dominoes and they're already falling.
[02:57:53.480 --> 02:57:59.480]  And if you feel alone, that's because most people are cowards and don't want to tell you what they really think.
[02:57:59.480 --> 02:58:04.480]  Congress doesn't have a 9% approval rating nationwide because people are completely asleep.
[02:58:04.480 --> 02:58:08.480]  And I hear you, V-Man, and I appreciate your call.
[02:58:08.480 --> 02:58:13.480]  I'd love to get to more calls, but the main transmission is over.
[02:58:13.480 --> 02:58:17.480]  I, coming up in rebroadcast on the internet streams at infowars.com,
[02:58:17.480 --> 02:58:24.480]  and the free podcast you can subscribe to for free because it's free at the listen page on infowars.com.
[02:58:24.480 --> 02:58:27.480]  That'll be sent out a few hours after the show as it always is.
[02:58:27.480 --> 02:58:30.480]  And of course, it's all archived at prisonplanet.tv.
[02:58:30.480 --> 02:58:36.480]  I covered the incredible Council of Supreme 13, a new form of government in the Republic.
[02:58:36.480 --> 02:58:50.480]  The death of the Republic if we let this go through and be continued.
[02:59:07.480 --> 02:59:10.480]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:59:10.480 --> 02:59:12.480]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:59:12.480 --> 02:59:16.480]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Panny May, Freddie Mac,
[02:59:16.480 --> 02:59:18.480]  and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:59:18.480 --> 02:59:22.480]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:59:22.480 --> 02:59:25.480]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free,
[02:59:25.480 --> 02:59:29.480]  detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener.
[02:59:29.480 --> 02:59:31.480]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:59:31.480 --> 02:59:33.480]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:59:33.480 --> 02:59:37.480]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:59:37.480 --> 02:59:42.480]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[02:59:42.480 --> 02:59:44.480]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[02:59:44.480 --> 02:59:48.480]  Watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[02:59:48.480 --> 03:00:04.480]  That's End of America 3.com.
[03:00:19.480 --> 03:00:25.480]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:25.480 --> 03:00:31.480]  Yeah, a little after-dinner dessert of extra-expanded retransmission,
[03:00:31.480 --> 03:00:35.480]  but we're live retransmission coming up with the key information.
[03:00:35.480 --> 03:00:39.480]  Up at prismplanet.com right now, former Comptroller General.
[03:00:39.480 --> 03:00:42.480]  Wow, that's big news. Steve Watson's written this article.
[03:00:42.480 --> 03:00:44.480]  We've got to get this out to everybody.
[03:00:44.480 --> 03:00:48.480]  Sudden and very painful economic collapse is coming.
[03:00:48.480 --> 03:00:52.480]  No kidding, they've lovingly maneuvered us into the iceberg patch to do just that.
[03:00:52.480 --> 03:00:59.480]  Representative Paul introduced his bill to cancel $1.6 trillion in debt held by Federal Reserve.
[03:00:59.480 --> 03:01:03.480]  I saw two mainstream news articles today about the hundreds of billions in gold
[03:01:03.480 --> 03:01:08.480]  the Federal Reserve secretly sitting on top of and calls to take that.
[03:01:08.480 --> 03:01:13.480]  Also, Super Congress, the final nail in the coffin of representative democracy and freedom,
[03:01:13.480 --> 03:01:18.480]  as we know it, this is all up on prismplanet.com and infowars.com.
[03:01:18.480 --> 03:01:23.480]  The U.S. Dictatorship and its White House servant president.
[03:01:23.480 --> 03:01:26.480]  Why Americans hated the debt debate.
[03:01:26.480 --> 03:01:31.480]  And it continues, Obama debt deal shakes trust of his supporters.
[03:01:31.480 --> 03:01:35.480]  Ron Paul sounds alarmed on disturbing Super Congress.
[03:01:35.480 --> 03:01:38.480]  You know, the good news is conservatives and liberals don't like what's going on.
[03:01:38.480 --> 03:01:45.480]  They're finally starting to figure it out. So pack of sharks up there working together.
[03:01:45.480 --> 03:01:48.480]  Council of 13 to rule America, key video.
[03:01:48.480 --> 03:01:50.480]  I'm going to be doing more special reports, everything today.
[03:01:50.480 --> 03:01:53.480]  Watch infowars.com, watch prismplanet.com.
[03:01:53.480 --> 03:01:56.480]  Very few are actually reporting on what's really just happened.
[03:01:56.480 --> 03:02:04.480]  Now, I went some into overdrive because quite frankly, I am really proud of myself.
[03:02:04.480 --> 03:02:09.480]  And not in an arrogant way. I mean, I'm proud when I do things and I'm right.
[03:02:09.480 --> 03:02:12.480]  And it helps people and when it helps me.
[03:02:12.480 --> 03:02:16.480]  I love win, win, win. I love making a big dinner for people when they come over to my house.
[03:02:16.480 --> 03:02:20.480]  I like people enjoying themselves. I like people being successful.
[03:02:20.480 --> 03:02:27.480]  And I always thought everybody was like me, but I found a lot of folks who get upset by the people, you know, being right or being successful.
[03:02:27.480 --> 03:02:33.480]  The point is, I told you get silver when it was $5 an ounce and it's 40 plus today.
[03:02:33.480 --> 03:02:39.480]  I told you get gold when it was 300 and something or even lower going back 11 years ago and it's low.
[03:02:39.480 --> 03:02:44.480]  And now it's 1600 and almost 50 something bucks.
[03:02:44.480 --> 03:02:46.480]  Tell us right now.
[03:02:46.480 --> 03:02:53.480]  And I people really need to call minus resources today and buy gold and silver with the radio specials.
[03:02:53.480 --> 03:02:57.480]  They've got because he just keeps going up and up and up, but you're buying gold.
[03:02:57.480 --> 03:03:02.480]  He bought when it was lower as it goes up so he can still sell it to you at a lower price.
[03:03:02.480 --> 03:03:05.480]  But then he runs out, but by then it's gone up even more so doesn't matter.
[03:03:05.480 --> 03:03:08.480]  He's got more gold at the old lower price.
[03:03:08.480 --> 03:03:13.480]  But Ted Anderson, what do you make of the Senate passing the tyranny bill?
[03:03:13.480 --> 03:03:15.480]  Well, you know, Alex, it's just like anything else.
[03:03:15.480 --> 03:03:22.480]  I mean, what they're doing is they're selling our future away and our children's future away and giving up our liberty and our freedom in the process.
[03:03:22.480 --> 03:03:30.480]  I mean, it's quite obvious by now that the government is tied by the hip to the banking system
[03:03:30.480 --> 03:03:33.480]  because who do you think we bailed out when we were having trouble?
[03:03:33.480 --> 03:03:45.480]  I mean, when President Bush was getting out of office and he had Paulson asking for money for New York City banks, they got their money.
[03:03:45.480 --> 03:03:49.480]  And that's where all this tarp money went to and all the bailouts.
[03:03:49.480 --> 03:03:57.480]  I mean, the way Ron Paul said it, if they gave just the money to the people that they printed to make this whole economic stimulus thing work,
[03:03:57.480 --> 03:04:02.480]  everybody would end up with about $17,000 in extra money in their pocket.
[03:04:02.480 --> 03:04:08.480]  Instead, it all went to these elite, you know, people so they can bail out their businesses and what do they do?
[03:04:08.480 --> 03:04:15.480]  They turn around and they start dishing out these really huge bonuses to their executives.
[03:04:15.480 --> 03:04:23.480]  And if you have any idea of what's going on in this world, if you have any question,
[03:04:23.480 --> 03:04:27.480]  you really should watch this American Dream video because it'll pull it all together.
[03:04:27.480 --> 03:04:33.480]  That's right, two silver dollars and a free film and a free book with free shipping, $85 and you're about to go up on prices.
[03:04:33.480 --> 03:04:37.480]  I know, Ted, 800-686-2237.
[03:04:37.480 --> 03:04:43.480]  The globalist are hoarding gold themselves because they understand it's a commodity.
[03:04:43.480 --> 03:04:45.480]  They're destroying currencies.
[03:04:45.480 --> 03:04:50.480]  So call, might as ask about the radio specials and we'll see you back tomorrow live, 11 a.m. Central.
[03:04:50.480 --> 03:04:53.480]  800-686-2237.
[03:04:53.480 --> 03:04:56.480]  800-686-2237.
[03:04:56.480 --> 03:05:21.480]  Get gold and silver today. These deals can't be made. Thank you, Ted.
