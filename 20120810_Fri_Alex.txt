[01:39.680 --> 01:45.600]  ground right down the highway at me 150 feet maybe but that's a drone moving a
[01:45.600 --> 01:48.640]  couple miles an hour shitting about a hundred and twenty five hundred fifty

[08:31.760 --> 08:39.320]  shot about an hour ago and then I got to go through the customary truck police
[08:39.320 --> 08:46.520]  checkpoint at a choke point in Austin and barely got to the studio so I I went
[08:46.520 --> 08:50.480]  through the the drone and then I went through the the highway checkpoint and
[08:50.480 --> 08:56.640]  so I'm I'm here in the great free country but I actually talked to the drone
[08:56.640 --> 09:01.880]  operator he was a nice fellow and we're gonna have that interview and the drone
[09:01.880 --> 09:08.280]  and everything as I'm driving on the highway 150 feet or so there's a drone
[09:08.280 --> 09:14.080]  and I pulled off and got footage and everything we should have that for the
[09:14.080 --> 09:20.160]  radio TV viewers by the third hour and Dave Krieger is coming in in the next
[09:20.160 --> 09:25.320]  hour we've got a Syrian girl who last year has exposed that Al Qaeda is

[09:29.520 --> 09:33.840]  CFR are praising Al Qaeda I covered this a few days ago in fact will you guys
[09:33.840 --> 09:38.200]  reprint me the it's Nemo's article but he has the quotes and the link to CFR
[09:38.200 --> 09:45.920]  CFR you know praises praises Al Qaeda I think that's the headline because I
[09:45.920 --> 09:50.040]  want to have those quotes so I can read those on air when we have them and show
[09:50.040 --> 09:54.920]  people the council on foreign relations I am supposedly anti-American because I
[09:54.920 --> 09:59.720]  do not support Al Qaeda who were being told is so valiant even London Guardian
[09:59.720 --> 10:03.760]  is how tough they are and how we're lucky to have them to get rid of Assad I
[10:03.760 --> 10:07.640]  mean Gaddafi goes and works with the West they set him up bring in jihad he's
[10:07.640 --> 10:12.840]  Al Qaeda I even had the guy that co-wrote the Patriot Games books and
[10:12.840 --> 10:18.440]  things with Tom Clancy Dr. Pachinic on a couple days ago he's a guy that was
[10:18.440 --> 10:22.880]  arrested by Assad's dad and you know try to bring down those governments he said
[10:22.880 --> 10:28.200]  it's probably wrong what's happening putting Al Qaeda in there probably wrong
[10:28.200 --> 10:33.840]  I mean this is amazing that I know I harp on this and harp on this and harp
[10:33.840 --> 10:39.880]  on this it's just so crazy to be trying to overthrow stable governments that are

[12:10.400 --> 12:14.920]  fellow says nothing to worry about but that is coming up in the third hour
[12:14.920 --> 12:19.400]  today they are downloading the video right now and because it is video I'm
[12:19.400 --> 12:25.200]  not gonna subject everybody on the radio to 20 minutes of drone noises what
[12:25.200 --> 12:28.720]  I'll do is just cut it down to some of the key things that the gentleman talked
[12:28.720 --> 12:32.080]  about and some of the things I talked about but for radio listeners you can
[12:32.080 --> 12:39.000]  also go to prison planet dot TV prison planet dot TV is a 15-day free trial

[13:50.400 --> 13:54.400]  it just an armory of information to defend our Republic it was funny I was
[13:54.400 --> 13:57.600]  talking to the drone operator he's going it's like a litmus test he was
[13:57.600 --> 14:03.280]  getting all freaked out I was like oh I like your American flag hardhat and I
[14:03.280 --> 14:11.240]  mean you know here I am wearing camouflage jungle boots a Beverly
[14:11.240 --> 14:17.080]  hillbillies you know Jethro style picnic shirt in blue jeans and I'm clean cut
[14:17.080 --> 14:21.080]  but just because I'm asking the guy about the drone he starts going now do
[14:21.080 --> 14:28.560]  you support the NRA as a litmus test I was like yeah yeah I'm an NRA member I
[14:28.560 --> 14:30.920]  think I'm a lifetime member I think I said I'm hundreds of bucks 20 something
[14:30.920 --> 14:34.120]  years ago to be a lifetime I never really paid attention moved a few times
[14:34.120 --> 14:37.360]  didn't change address right didn't don't get the magazine anymore but we're the
[14:37.360 --> 14:41.960]  ones making the NRA do their job gun owners of America all the rest of it
[14:41.960 --> 14:49.960]  are people making the NRA do their job so yes we are pro gun for the guy he knew
[14:49.960 --> 14:54.120]  I was we didn't really he was like I was like you know they're weaponizing drones
[14:54.120 --> 14:56.920]  he's like well that's a conspiracy theory and I'm like really so when we put
[14:56.920 --> 15:01.360]  the video out today we will show the news articles showing that and again my
[15:01.360 --> 15:04.480]  deal is I'm not against drones for highway department if they want to
[15:04.480 --> 15:09.160]  promise it's always then use later to surveillance show that's coming up my
[15:09.160 --> 15:13.240]  little visit Alex Jones Joe Farrah asked me and I was up there in
[15:13.240 --> 15:17.120]  Bilderberg in Virginia a few months ago from World End Daily he said you ever
[15:17.120 --> 15:21.200]  been you know buzzed by a drone you ever seen one I said no only on the news well
[15:21.200 --> 15:24.880]  now I have a week after I'm at his office he lives in a rural area it comes
[15:24.880 --> 15:30.160]  over his house the police drone so we're going to be taught and he said
[15:30.160 --> 15:33.760]  there's five of them operating in Austin just for the highway department
[15:33.760 --> 15:39.280]  right now and the police department's getting them and they got Texas police
[15:39.280 --> 15:42.800]  department's weaponizing them so that's all coming up and here's big sis big
[15:42.800 --> 15:47.200]  sis drones to be used for public safety to the big broadcast lined up for you
[15:47.200 --> 15:53.280]  today and again this is New York daily news it's also in the New York Post
[15:53.280 --> 16:00.240]  Homeland Security Secretary Napolitano favored women pals for jobs no no we had
[16:00.240 --> 16:04.080]  a sheriff here in Austin that looked like her sister I just don't want these
[16:04.080 --> 16:11.760]  women all look exactly the same I mean it's just it's a strange thing and it
[16:11.760 --> 16:14.280]  became a big issue because I know a lot of the sheriff's department people still
[16:14.280 --> 16:18.720]  do and I knew the SWAT team guys because I had a confrontation with them and they
[16:18.720 --> 16:21.960]  invited me over and my videos were there and others they were like we know what's
[16:21.960 --> 16:25.640]  going on and they thought I was a cook and then Delta Force visited them about
[16:25.640 --> 16:30.000]  secret police operations in town and Lieutenant Beck spoke out about it so
[16:30.000 --> 16:35.240]  they trumped up some reason to fire him but I got to hear all about how all she
[16:35.240 --> 16:43.720]  would do was hire her gal pals so again I mean this is this is what happens
[16:43.720 --> 16:51.080]  these little these little kingdoms get set up so there you there you have it
[16:51.080 --> 16:57.800]  and this is a senior person with this lawsuit this is a big deal a veteran US
[16:57.800 --> 17:00.680]  law enforcement official has filed a blockbuster discrimination lawsuit against
[17:00.680 --> 17:05.520]  Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano also known as what's the name
[17:05.520 --> 17:14.240]  of the person on Saturday Night Live Pat Pat Pat's out of control up there I'm
[17:14.240 --> 17:18.920]  sorry I'm really bad charging she pushed him aside to make way for a less
[17:18.920 --> 17:23.320]  qualified woman who's enjoyed a long-standing relationship with the
[17:23.320 --> 17:28.680]  anti-terror chief oh I bet she's had a relationship with her oh man I tell you
[17:28.680 --> 17:33.000]  and again nothing against these type of women but I mean does every Supreme
[17:33.000 --> 17:36.920]  Court job have to go to one there's every law I mean just just I have to like and
[17:36.920 --> 17:42.680]  and then and the thing is they hate men I mean I've run into the CPS quite a bit
[17:42.680 --> 17:46.560]  and half of them are these women the other half are pedophile men that's why
[17:46.560 --> 17:52.160]  the CPS has over about to say 50 last time I was over 60% turnover every year
[17:52.160 --> 17:56.120]  because normal people get in wanting to help kids and they're like you mean we
[17:56.120 --> 18:03.880]  drug them up and take them to pedophile factories I'm quitting it's just like
[18:03.880 --> 18:06.680]  TSA they used to have a lot of good people there they were after 9-11 they
[18:06.680 --> 18:09.600]  were just hired they thought it was for security they bought the hoax but they
[18:09.600 --> 18:12.280]  all quit when it's like now take a three-year-old behind closed doors and
[18:12.280 --> 18:16.720]  take their underwear off I mean it's like what did I mean well again just hire
[18:16.720 --> 18:19.560]  Jerry Sandusky they've been hiring all these pedophiles around the airports
[18:19.560 --> 18:22.680]  anyways it's come out in the news they fraud priests you name it this is the
[18:22.680 --> 18:27.280]  hell we're going in there a bunch of crazy people who were repressed or
[18:27.280 --> 18:31.480]  something when they were growing up so they turn into perverts continuing I
[18:31.480 --> 18:34.560]  mean imagine having a job like Homeland Security head and all you hire is your
[18:34.560 --> 18:39.800]  your special friends something based on something like that your special friends
[18:39.800 --> 18:45.480]  special friends you know what I mean and it just goes on she's now been appointed
[18:45.480 --> 18:49.000]  by Mayor Bloomberg as commissioner city Department of Correction yeah maybe
[18:49.000 --> 18:52.160]  she'll go out and be a police chief in Colorado and then magically something
[18:52.160 --> 18:55.520]  will happen like a Bloomberg's other minion the court papers also allege
[18:55.520 --> 18:59.520]  that Suzanne Barr and Paul Thomas chief of staff immigration and customs
[18:59.520 --> 19:03.720]  enforcement union the folks that legalize the illegals and order the IRS to give
[19:03.720 --> 19:07.360]  them fake ID so they can then attach them to real social security and rip people
[19:07.360 --> 19:10.760]  off and ruin their credit at this IRS grab the citizens bank accounts you've
[19:10.760 --> 19:14.600]  been set up you mean stuff like that has engaged in numerous acts of sexually
[19:14.600 --> 19:18.840]  offensive behavior to humiliate intimidate male employees yeah that's
[19:18.840 --> 19:23.200]  what I've noticed in my life and men do stuff too I mean I mean men get attracted
[19:23.200 --> 19:27.240]  to women they go after them in the workplace and it's wrong in fact we've
[19:27.240 --> 19:32.200]  got a no fraternization thing going on here that I've got enforced but the
[19:32.200 --> 19:39.760]  point is is that you want to read this stuff it is just that women use sex as
[19:39.760 --> 19:46.640]  the weapon and you know you know and then when men sit there and bite on it's a
[19:46.640 --> 19:51.600]  problem but with this it's the opposite it's just a bunch of women up top
[19:51.600 --> 19:55.840]  laughing at the men making fun of them all day as they walk around their black
[19:55.840 --> 20:01.960]  knee-high jackboots with their bull whips will be right back the worst drought in 50

[25:15.600 --> 25:20.360]  be like saying I love the time I chopped my finger off it was fun it's a bunch of
[25:20.360 --> 25:25.360]  lunatics who want the TSA to abuse your family and train them for pedophilia
[25:25.360 --> 25:28.680]  abuse top psychologists have been on record saying it trains them for that
[25:28.680 --> 25:36.200]  boy this is some sordid stuff about old Janet cousin it or whatever her name is
[25:36.200 --> 25:42.440]  it goes on as we break this down a veteran US law enforcement official has
[25:42.440 --> 25:47.680]  followed a blockbuster discrimination lawsuit against Homeland Security
[25:47.680 --> 25:54.640]  Secretary Janet Napolitano charging she pushed him aside to make way very less
[25:54.640 --> 25:59.080]  qualified woman who was enjoying a long-standing relationship with the
[25:59.080 --> 26:05.040]  anti-terror chief the woman Dora Sherrow I think I pronounced that right was
[26:05.040 --> 26:09.360]  later appointed by Mayor Bloomberg as commissioner over the slaves of New York
[26:09.360 --> 26:16.320]  I should add the city Department of Correction of the dungeon pits the court
[26:16.320 --> 26:20.800]  paper is also alleged that Suzanne Barr the political chief of staff at
[26:20.800 --> 26:24.920]  immigration and customs enforcement the ones that engaged in treason and
[26:24.920 --> 26:30.960]  sedition and other criminal activities raising our defenses loading the shields
[26:30.960 --> 26:34.840]  has engaged in numerous acts of sexually offensive behavior intended to
[26:34.840 --> 26:39.040]  humiliate and intimidate male employees well yeah these women are like super
[26:39.040 --> 26:42.600]  males is what they're like bars alleged act included calling one man in his
[26:42.600 --> 26:48.680]  hotel room and screaming at him that she wanted his bleeper oh yeah they really
[26:48.680 --> 26:53.040]  hate men's male organs whatever reason in the back oh my gosh I can't even say
[26:53.040 --> 27:01.280]  this on air the suit was filed by James T. Haynes Jr. special agent in charge of
[27:01.280 --> 27:04.160]  New York investigations for immigration and customs enforcement
[27:04.160 --> 27:08.720]  hey he's who began it just goes on and I can't even read this on air I can't even
[27:08.720 --> 27:12.760]  read this on air I mean these women you know it's it's it's like they say in
[27:12.760 --> 27:19.200]  team America it's not about sex Gary it's about power and that's what these
[27:19.200 --> 27:26.360]  women are doing this is how they're dominating everyone and it is just
[27:26.360 --> 27:29.640]  thoroughly disgusting but it also happens the other way men get into power
[27:29.640 --> 27:35.800]  and they have special friends who they hire and put into all the positions not
[27:35.800 --> 27:39.680]  because they're qualified not because they're the best of the job but because
[27:39.680 --> 27:47.280]  well they go to the same clubs we'll just leave it a pattern take showers in
[27:47.280 --> 27:54.600]  the same showers and well you know and again the issue here is I don't have
[27:54.600 --> 27:58.560]  hate for people out there I don't like the fact that they have hate for me
[27:58.560 --> 28:02.760]  because a lot of these groups they put down the family they say they want to
[28:02.760 --> 28:07.800]  get rid of it they don't like the fact that you know some men like women and
[28:07.800 --> 28:12.880]  some women like men and some people like the founding fathers and the Second
[28:12.880 --> 28:17.480]  Amendment and some of us never get tired of just well the things ways have been
[28:17.480 --> 28:20.840]  wait things have been for tens of thousands of years in human development
[28:20.840 --> 28:25.000]  you know some of us just it fits we like it and we just don't want our school
[28:25.000 --> 28:28.480]  children and government brainwashing centers at age five being taught how to
[28:28.480 --> 28:32.920]  do things sexually I didn't learn about till college how about you just keep your

[34:23.880 --> 34:26.640]  gonna read some of these quotes there after we talk to our guests a little
[34:26.640 --> 34:31.440]  bit CFR strategist last week praises al Qaeda actually this is just Tuesday
[34:31.440 --> 34:36.080]  August 7th but the CFR report came out last week Paul Watson wrote about it on
[34:36.080 --> 34:41.360]  Tuesday CFR strategist praises al Qaeda bombings in Syria this is from the
[34:41.360 --> 34:46.180]  Council on Foreign Relations online publication the Syrian rebels the
[34:46.180 --> 34:53.280]  rebels would be immeasurably weaker today without al Qaeda in their ranks by in
[34:53.280 --> 34:58.720]  large three Syrian army FSA battalions are tired divided sounds like the
[34:58.720 --> 35:03.320]  criminal government chaotic and ineffective feeling abandoned by the
[35:03.320 --> 35:07.080]  West you mean the bankers that have occupied the West rebel forces are
[35:07.080 --> 35:12.040]  increasingly demoralized as they square off with the Assad regime's superior
[35:12.040 --> 35:16.560]  weaponry and professional army writes a senior fellow at the Middle East Eastern
[35:16.560 --> 35:21.800]  studies with the CFR al Qaeda fighters however may help improve morale the
[35:21.800 --> 35:26.440]  influx of jihadist brings discipline religious fervor battle experience from
[35:26.440 --> 35:31.320]  Iraq funding from Sunni sympathizers in the Gulf and most importantly deadly
[35:31.320 --> 35:39.120]  results yeah like 9-11 in short the FSA needs al Qaeda now and I read last week
[35:39.120 --> 35:41.640]  that London Guardian article where they're like man they are really tough
[35:41.640 --> 35:46.520]  and they got nice black uniforms and they fly their flags and the Guardian
[35:46.520 --> 35:51.200]  said al Qaeda leading the freedom fight and blowing up churches and synagogues
[35:51.200 --> 35:55.880]  in fact that was in the news yesterday blowing up ethnic cleansing in Africa
[35:55.880 --> 36:00.000]  they're in Libya lining up the blacks it's their country machine gunning tens
[36:00.000 --> 36:05.920]  of thousands ha ha NATO landing 3000 al Qaeda in Tripoli blowing up the city
[36:05.920 --> 36:12.800]  ha ha it's so loving of course I'm here being sarcastic how sick this is but
[36:12.800 --> 36:17.560]  joining us as a lady who goes bravely just by Syrian girl her family she's
[36:17.560 --> 36:21.160]  been with us before I'm gonna give you a brief bio actually left because of
[36:21.160 --> 36:26.720]  political persecution under the Assad senior okay so she comes from one of
[36:26.720 --> 36:30.320]  the big you know high-up families in the country won't say where she lives but
[36:30.320 --> 36:35.480]  she joins us via Skype so this is somebody who didn't even like Assad okay
[36:35.480 --> 36:38.960]  I mean that's like Steve Petrinick doesn't like Assad was arrested by his
[36:38.960 --> 36:42.720]  father tried to you know basically overthrow those countries Steve Petrinick
[36:42.720 --> 36:46.320]  former head of the State Department black ops said yeah this is wrong and I
[36:46.320 --> 36:49.960]  can't believe I'm having to say Russia you know I understand my rush is trying
[36:49.960 --> 36:54.480]  to keep a son in because they're blowing up and burning the churches and killing
[36:54.480 --> 36:59.360]  Alawite Muslims were really Christians and killing a bunch of other I mean it
[36:59.360 --> 37:03.200]  is hellish and if you're a Jew and that's one of the oldest Jewish communities
[37:03.200 --> 37:07.120]  in the world you're just dead you're a Christian you'll probably be dead Alawite
[37:07.120 --> 37:11.920]  you're dead and they are just blowing everything up and and and it's just
[37:11.920 --> 37:15.240]  incredible so Syrian girls been very brave she's had the globalist of course
[37:15.240 --> 37:19.680]  attacker and demonizer because when you're over the target you get flack and
[37:19.680 --> 37:22.720]  everything she talked about here I don't know eight nine months ago has now
[37:22.720 --> 37:25.800]  been confirmed everything tarply when he traveled there six seven eight months
[37:25.800 --> 37:30.000]  ago was a longer ago and was in areas where Al Qaeda they kill people and then
[37:30.000 --> 37:33.480]  blame it on Assad they blow up schools and blame it on Assad I remember six
[37:33.480 --> 37:37.360]  months ago our media would say events were done by Assad when they've now
[37:37.360 --> 37:41.000]  admitted it was Al Qaeda this is called peaceful protesting when you blow up a
[37:41.000 --> 37:44.560]  school or blow up a police department by these people by the scum that runs our
[37:44.560 --> 37:49.620]  country so joining us from an undisclosed location is Syrian girl via video
[37:49.620 --> 37:53.600]  Skype of radio listeners are tuning in you can go to prison planet TV to see the
[37:53.600 --> 37:57.640]  video if not we'll archive it later today for everybody for free but good to
[37:57.640 --> 38:02.040]  have you here Syrian girl tell us since we talked a few months ago the break
[38:02.040 --> 38:06.000]  down from family you've gotten Syria what the latest intel is because you're
[38:06.000 --> 38:10.600]  your intelligence you've given us has turned out to be absolutely on target
[38:10.600 --> 38:18.360]  well according to what sources on the ground I think that you know any sort
[38:18.360 --> 38:25.400]  of sympathy people had with the as they call it rebellions it's really like a
[38:25.400 --> 38:30.000]  foreign funded insurgency is out especially when the major cities has
[38:30.000 --> 38:37.120]  been it have been attacked by outsiders it's not like a ingrown sort of rebellion
[38:37.120 --> 38:41.000]  that's happening from inside the city these people are coming from the outskirt
[38:41.000 --> 38:44.680]  towns or they're coming from around the Middle East and they're attacking the
[38:44.680 --> 38:48.400]  two major cities which the masques and Aleppo and people's lives have been
[38:48.400 --> 38:54.520]  disrupted there's been bombings there's been shooting on the street you know my
[38:54.520 --> 39:00.400]  aunt was in in hospital and she was you know in a very critical state and at the
[39:00.400 --> 39:03.960]  same time she had to deal with the fact that there was bombing just outside the
[39:03.960 --> 39:09.360]  hospital so thank God what that's over now because the military has now secured
[39:09.360 --> 39:13.400]  the mascus which is the capital city and at the moment the same thing is
[39:13.400 --> 39:17.720]  happening in Aleppo you know the military is again just about to declare a
[39:17.720 --> 39:23.520]  victory in Aleppo would they're not quite there yet but the insurgents or the
[39:23.520 --> 39:28.640]  foreign mercenaries you know there's so many names for them they're inside the
[39:28.640 --> 39:34.840]  outskirt of Aleppo which is the most popular city but not the not the capital
[39:34.840 --> 39:41.120]  and they're in a place called Salah-e-Din which in Western language you'd
[39:41.120 --> 39:48.600]  probably understand more Saladin so yes and bottom line they're basically Sunni
[39:48.600 --> 39:53.760]  Wahhabi as jihadis who just want to get rid of all the Muslim sex that are there
[39:53.760 --> 39:58.760]  I mean that's admitted this is Saudi Arabian Western-backed scorched earth
[39:58.760 --> 40:03.200]  extermination program being hailed by the Nobel Peace Prize winner is loving
[40:03.200 --> 40:09.800]  well you know you have the Wahhabis this sort of it's called the FSA you know
[40:09.800 --> 40:14.320]  the Free Syrian Army whatever it's got many different factions and some of them
[40:14.320 --> 40:19.080]  are so extreme the Wahhabis which are affiliated to al-Qaeda so basically the
[40:19.080 --> 40:23.720]  same as al-Qaeda they hate everybody that isn't Wahhabi they don't just hate
[40:23.720 --> 40:28.320]  Christians they don't just hate Allah wife they also hate Sunnis because to
[40:28.320 --> 40:34.560]  them Sunnis are bad Muslims as well so it's not just you know Sunnis being the
[40:34.560 --> 40:38.640]  ones against the government because actually the majority of Syria are Sunni
[40:38.640 --> 40:43.040]  I come from a Sunni background but we don't want anything to do with those
[40:43.040 --> 40:51.000]  sectarian New World Order controlled puppets of imperialists so whilst you
[40:51.000 --> 40:57.280]  have like Wahhabis taking power as the Guardian and the CFR said inside the
[40:57.280 --> 41:02.040]  Zersi there are some Muslim Brotherhood elements in there as well and they're
[41:02.040 --> 41:06.280]  also controlled of course by Turkey which is a Muslim Brotherhood country and
[41:06.280 --> 41:11.400]  they're being supported by the new Muslim Brotherhood wave that's taken over
[41:11.400 --> 41:18.040]  under the auspices of the Arab Spring. Let's talk about the massacres the
[41:18.040 --> 41:24.480]  churches the jihadis dressed up in Christian Orthodox rubs desecrating
[41:24.480 --> 41:28.240]  churches killing people it's now come out confirm what you said I don't know
[41:28.240 --> 41:31.720]  the first time you come on seven eight nine months ago or longer that they are
[41:31.720 --> 41:35.960]  doing fake newscast Syrian Danny it did turn out they had people laying down what
[41:35.960 --> 41:41.120]  they were dead fake burials I mean it's just amazing and Anderson Cooper just
[41:41.120 --> 41:47.480]  plays along with it it's been a total media war that's really what it's it's
[41:47.480 --> 41:52.760]  been it's trying to create this illusion of all these horrors happening in Syria
[41:52.760 --> 41:58.440]  as undergone by the Syrian government as you know they killed like 200 children
[41:58.440 --> 42:02.880]  under the age of five just so that they can have this false flag hula massacre
[42:02.880 --> 42:07.320]  which in the end blew up in their face because it turned out that even the
[42:07.320 --> 42:11.240]  German newspaper said that a lot of the families that were killed were actually
[42:11.240 --> 42:16.040]  either pro-government Sunnis that were took part in the elections or otherwise so
[42:16.040 --> 42:21.200]  you know again with the Christians they were their churches were desecrated in
[42:21.200 --> 42:26.240]  homes I think the whole thing that's happening in Syria right now is to try
[42:26.240 --> 42:31.080]  to get the Christians out and turn them into refugees because they want to
[42:31.080 --> 42:35.640]  basically remove all the secular countries inside the Middle East Libya
[42:35.640 --> 42:43.240]  was secular Iraq used to be secular so it's now serious turn of Syria is one
[42:43.240 --> 42:47.280]  of the last secular countries left and so they want to just get the Christians
[42:47.280 --> 42:51.520]  out for whatever reason and just Islamatized the whole place maybe to
[42:51.520 --> 42:56.800]  have some kind of interreligious war that you know destroys a soul in the end
[42:56.800 --> 43:00.960]  exactly no that's the state of Pentagon and Israeli plan is Balkanization get
[43:00.960 --> 43:05.120]  the Shiites and Sunnis all killing each other wow instead of they would have
[43:05.120 --> 43:10.720]  just left Muhammad Mosaddek in in 53 pro-America secular unifier wanted to
[43:10.720 --> 43:15.360]  build up Iran the whole place could just be glistening tourist attractions with
[43:15.360 --> 43:21.520]  all the great beaches and everything instead a crazy sect set up by British
[43:21.520 --> 43:26.120]  intelligence and Lawrence of Arabia was given control of what became Saudi
[43:26.120 --> 43:31.000]  Arabia and now exports mass murder and death everywhere so that I mean that's
[43:31.000 --> 43:35.760]  the policy here shut off our power plants ship our jobs overseas attack the
[43:35.760 --> 43:41.840]  family the globalist want everyone on their knees and screwed up and it is I
[43:41.840 --> 43:44.840]  mean that's why they caught British intelligence running Guardian Associated
[43:44.840 --> 43:50.920]  Press in Basra dressed up like Wahhabist running around shooting Shiites to get a
[43:50.920 --> 43:54.320]  war going and it did just because you want to keep them fighting with each
[43:54.320 --> 43:58.520]  other as a pretext to be there at first and then after that it got so out of hand
[43:58.520 --> 44:01.880]  they had to pay him off to quit killing each other that was the so-called surge
[44:01.880 --> 44:07.880]  it's just absolutely insane then they export radical Muslims into the West and
[44:07.880 --> 44:12.200]  use them to menace people so they can take all of our liberties and then flip
[44:12.200 --> 44:16.760]  the script and now say that patriots who were anti-banker occupation that we are
[44:16.760 --> 44:20.000]  the terrorist I mean it is just incredible to sit there and see the
[44:20.000 --> 44:25.720]  Council on Foreign Relations saying we need Al Qaeda what is it like for you to
[44:25.720 --> 44:29.440]  be ridiculed when you first started going public what over a year ago total in
[44:29.440 --> 44:32.680]  fact you probably know the dates when did you first go public I think it was
[44:32.680 --> 44:37.720]  about at most six months ago and time has been flying I think you did videos
[44:37.720 --> 44:42.080]  before six months ago maybe you're right I'm not very good with time go to her
[44:42.080 --> 44:45.520]  YouTube site and see I'm obsessed with this now I think you've been doing
[44:45.520 --> 44:49.840]  videos for almost a year but side issue the point is what is it like to now see
[44:49.840 --> 44:53.920]  them say oh there's no Al Qaeda that's not true or okay there is Al Qaeda we
[44:53.920 --> 44:57.240]  got to take over because they're there and people like but you work but you're
[44:57.240 --> 45:00.880]  running them to oh Al Qaeda is good I mean what is that like for you to sit
[45:00.880 --> 45:04.960]  there and watch that happen and the fact you've been vindicated I'm kind of
[45:04.960 --> 45:09.280]  the muse to be honest I mean I've known it for years I know I've only been
[45:09.280 --> 45:14.480]  public for maybe a year but before that I've been following me this thing you
[45:14.480 --> 45:20.280]  know since 10 years ago so I know that they created Al Qaeda they created it in
[45:20.280 --> 45:26.080]  Afghanistan when they were trying to fight the Soviets so it's yes I've been
[45:26.080 --> 45:32.160]  vindicated but unfortunately people have not completely realized it they are
[45:32.160 --> 45:35.840]  realizing it but it's not across the board you know there's still people
[45:35.840 --> 45:40.880]  giving monies to NGOs like Amnesty International and thinking that
[45:40.880 --> 45:46.320]  intervention in Syria in any form even giving money to these so-called rubbles
[45:46.320 --> 45:50.440]  these insurgents is a good thing you know people are are still buying into it
[45:50.440 --> 45:58.240]  and you know it's amazing the goal of it you know it's so in your face they love
[45:58.240 --> 46:02.280]  Al Qaeda now tomorrow yesterday they hated it before that they loved it
[46:02.280 --> 46:06.640]  yesterday they were the terrorists Muslims were the terrorists today you know
[46:06.640 --> 46:11.480]  the the veterans in that fought the American veterans that fought in the
[46:11.480 --> 46:16.960]  Middle East are now in America listed under the terror watch list so it's
[46:16.960 --> 46:21.480]  it's just the way they work you know it's total opportunism they do it
[46:21.480 --> 46:26.120]  because it gets them power that's the whole idea and maybe there's some
[46:26.120 --> 46:30.640]  ideological basis behind it as well the powers that be they you know they have
[46:30.640 --> 46:36.720]  that crackpot religion that they they want to install so and just to be
[46:36.720 --> 46:40.520]  technical you you went public about eight months ago so where it wasn't six
[46:40.520 --> 46:45.120]  it wasn't here it was about eight months ago now again since then this has all
[46:45.120 --> 46:48.520]  come out in the open which the power structure did not want to be out in the
[46:48.520 --> 46:53.600]  open in fact Bilderberg in Switzerland a year and three months ago was very
[46:53.600 --> 46:57.880]  upset from our internal moles that it was in the LA Times that Al Qaeda was
[46:57.880 --> 47:05.720]  being brought in by NATO the US and the Muslim Brotherhood out of eastern areas
[47:05.720 --> 47:10.720]  there in Egypt into the west in Libya now that was confirmed they're very
[47:10.720 --> 47:17.360]  upset about this fact now because that shatters their whole paradigm to to to
[47:17.360 --> 47:23.320]  break down how the battle is going what is your best level analysis of where
[47:23.320 --> 47:28.160]  things are I mean is the Assad regime in more trouble than it was six months ago
[47:28.160 --> 47:34.400]  or has it turned the tide and now we're hearing about NATO maybe bombing with
[47:34.400 --> 47:41.000]  with peace bombs again well what's happened now is you know ever since the
[47:41.000 --> 47:46.440]  Homs battle in Bab Amr that was very decisive and it's sort of that was a
[47:46.440 --> 47:51.120]  turning point you know that was the bit basically the Benghazi for the
[47:51.120 --> 47:57.480]  insurgency the home base now was destroyed so they no no longer have that
[47:57.480 --> 48:02.200]  so they are sort of a discombobulated and they did launch an offensive on
[48:02.200 --> 48:07.320]  Damascus but they hold no ground and every offensive they've launched against
[48:07.320 --> 48:10.920]  the city they've been pushed back and they're gonna be pushed back again in
[48:10.920 --> 48:16.160]  Aleppo so time and time again the army has been victorious and if it hasn't been
[48:16.160 --> 48:19.760]  I would tell you that you know I have no problem telling you exactly what's
[48:19.760 --> 48:24.520]  happening but even if you listen to the analysts Robert Fisk anybody else they
[48:24.520 --> 48:27.760]  will tell you the same thing the insurgency is being defeated time and
[48:27.760 --> 48:32.360]  time again exactly so now they want to send in the Nobel peace bombs in fact I
[48:32.360 --> 48:35.400]  think it's a short painting the Nobel peace sign on because you know war is
[48:35.400 --> 48:38.880]  peace in this 1984 Al-Qaeda's our enemy now they're our friend I mean it's
[48:38.880 --> 48:45.760]  direct 1984 so expanding on this area what do you expect him to do now more
[48:45.760 --> 48:49.760]  cruise missiles they claim are suicide bombers right through the window of the
[48:49.760 --> 48:55.400]  Ministry of Defense you know killing the chief folks well the thing is about a
[48:55.400 --> 48:59.360]  no-fly zone they can't do it if they could do it they would already have done
[48:59.360 --> 49:03.800]  it but the thing that stops them is the Syrian air defense which they now
[49:03.800 --> 49:07.840]  admit is you know one of the best in the world we have very good surface air
[49:07.840 --> 49:12.440]  missiles but what they can do is even more dangers they can do the chemical
[49:12.440 --> 49:16.520]  weapons false flag that's been talked about I'm glad you brought that up get
[49:16.520 --> 49:20.440]  into that that's even been an Israeli news that Al Qaeda has been given
[49:20.440 --> 49:24.080]  chemicals from Qaddafi stockpile and all those missiles and they're getting
[49:24.080 --> 49:28.640]  ready to blame Syrian government tell us about that even if it weren't Qaddafi
[49:28.640 --> 49:34.040]  stockpile I've heard a journalist Lizzie Fallon tell me that actually the
[49:34.040 --> 49:39.200]  insurgents were in the rebels in Libya were given chemical weapons and did use
[49:39.200 --> 49:43.800]  them against other tribes in Libya so they they have been used before so the
[49:43.800 --> 49:48.320]  idea is to get to give the chemical weapons or maybe they have already given
[49:48.320 --> 49:51.760]  them the chemical weapons to the Syrian insurgents I think they already have
[49:51.760 --> 49:55.840]  because we see them all wearing gas masks now in the shipments of gas masks
[49:55.840 --> 50:00.480]  coming in and to launch a chemical weapon attack and then to accuse the
[50:00.480 --> 50:03.960]  Syrian government of doing it and take it to the Security Council because as
[50:03.960 --> 50:10.120]  things are now because they can't do a no-fly zone they'd like some other way
[50:10.120 --> 50:15.200]  to disarm Syria they'd like something to hold over its head and as we know what
[50:15.200 --> 50:19.800]  happened with Iraq you know first of all the UN came in and they made sure that
[50:19.800 --> 50:23.520]  Iraq couldn't defend itself they made sure that Iraq doesn't have chemical
[50:23.520 --> 50:30.080]  weapons and then the US attacked so that's that's the same narrative over
[50:30.080 --> 50:34.920]  and over again by the way Syrian girl I told the guys on Monday I wanted to get
[50:34.920 --> 50:38.640]  you on and I had forgotten why I wanted to get you on when I saw on the list
[50:38.640 --> 50:41.880]  today I mean I wanted a general report that's why I wanted you on is because
[50:41.880 --> 50:45.200]  you've been breaking down and I went and looked up the articles you showed it's
[50:45.200 --> 50:49.160]  even in Israeli news that al Qaeda is getting chemical weapons and it may be
[50:49.160 --> 50:53.160]  a false flag I mean that's amazing and then that's how they'll bring NATO in
[50:53.160 --> 50:57.280]  saying look at that dirty aside he used chemical weapons on his poor people
[50:57.280 --> 51:03.440]  amazing would be another big war crime by the globalist Alex Jones here with a

[55:04.360 --> 55:08.000]  cases sold mortgages they never even owned or had they and the courts are so

[55:46.360 --> 55:51.000]  lawsuits against these big six mega banks that are stealing houses but people
[55:51.000 --> 55:57.920]  are going to jail that are filing fake patriot mythology stuff okay you'll
[55:57.920 --> 56:03.120]  declare and I'm not a citizen of the UN captured territory of the realm and then
[56:03.120 --> 56:06.640]  they go to jail we're gonna talk about patriot mythology here because I don't
[56:06.640 --> 56:10.280]  want to see you go to jail I want you to get a tool that really kicks behind end
[56:10.280 --> 56:14.560]  of the globalist because we want to win here okay and when I say patriot I'm a
[56:14.560 --> 56:18.200]  patriot I love and there's a lot of real law a lot of real pro se out there
[56:18.200 --> 56:23.160]  there's also a lot of bull a lot of hokum a lot of poppycock a lot of
[56:23.160 --> 56:28.760]  boulder dash a lot of really scrambled baloney now now searing girl we're
[56:28.760 --> 56:33.880]  gonna continue to the next segment on this it's so important here today the
[56:33.880 --> 56:37.080]  spectacle that in the last two weeks they've been hyping the sod's gonna use
[56:37.080 --> 56:41.440]  chemical weapons and then admitting that and suddenly you see al-qaeda people
[56:41.440 --> 56:45.480]  running around with the gas mask and even debka file saying the word is al-qaeda
[56:45.480 --> 56:48.800]  has got chemical weapons out of Libya and all those missiles they got what's
[56:48.800 --> 56:51.960]  gonna happen now with thousands of heat-sinking missiles over two thousand
[56:51.960 --> 56:56.200]  alone or heat-sinking at radar guided ten thousand plus of just general anti
[56:56.200 --> 57:00.440]  aircraft missiles they got in Libya and now our friend al-qaeda were told is
[57:00.440 --> 57:04.320]  gonna have these I mean but how is sticking their hands down my pants at
[57:04.320 --> 57:10.400]  the airport gonna save me Syrian girl from their loving al-qaeda well they do
[57:10.400 --> 57:16.040]  have anti air now we've got pictures of them with the stella to surface to air
[57:16.040 --> 57:23.240]  heat-sinking you know come take it wherever you go missiles so it's already
[57:23.240 --> 57:28.000]  in their hands they just they haven't been able to get the experience to use
[57:28.000 --> 57:32.200]  it appropriately and you know it's not going to save you this whole thing is
[57:32.200 --> 57:36.840]  gonna destroy us all because the only way this can end is in a war and it's
[57:36.840 --> 57:41.800]  might be a regional war if you're lucky it might be a world war it might be a
[57:41.800 --> 57:47.320]  nuclear world war because you have Russia and China not backing down and you
[57:47.320 --> 57:53.680]  have NATO and the GCC countries and Israel not backing down so you know if
[57:53.680 --> 57:58.200]  if they don't pull back this is how it's going to end because Syria can't
[57:58.200 --> 58:02.680]  continue like this for years and years you know eventually something's gonna
[58:02.680 --> 58:09.000]  break someone's gonna move in you know someone's gonna cross that line and when
[58:09.000 --> 58:16.920]  that happens it's gonna be all over we do you want to apologize for being
[58:16.920 --> 58:21.000]  unpatriotic and not wanting al-qaeda to murder and burn and kill hundreds of
[58:21.000 --> 58:24.000]  thousands of people Syrian girl do you want to apologize in the last eight
[58:24.000 --> 58:27.360]  months you fought against this here on air do you want to support al-qaeda like
[58:27.360 --> 58:31.280]  our president does you want to pledge allegiance absolutely no I don't know
[58:31.280 --> 58:34.560]  when to support al-qaeda al-qaeda or anything and I don't know you're not
[58:34.560 --> 58:38.760]  pledging allegiance like our government has to al-qaeda okay no I apologize for

[58:59.320 --> 59:02.120]  this country I don't have to tell you about the power grid and just how
[59:02.120 --> 59:06.360]  vulnerable it is that's in the mainstream news every day millions of people

[01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:38.720]  Alex Jones we are now into our number two worldwide transmission all right
[01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:41.520]  sharing a girl reporting from an undisclosed location everything you've
[01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:44.880]  talked about the last eight months has turned out to be accurate the Russians
[01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:48.800]  are talking about the Third World War a lot of analysts are you've got the floor
[01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:52.160]  of the last five minutes of this a portion of the interview to break down
[01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:59.680]  other facets thank you very much I have the urge to say that you you're a
[01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:04.680]  patriot and I'm a patriot so we understand each other we don't want
[01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:08.840]  enemies we just want to live the way we want to live independently and have
[01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:13.840]  safety in our land and see what serious facing at the moment you can say
[01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:18.360]  whatever you want about each side you can every side might have a sad story
[01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:22.880]  you know that's absolutely true but the end of the day Syria is facing a foreign
[01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:28.920]  attack by foreigners and everybody who loves their country who wants it to be
[01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:33.600]  secure would oppose that in their own nation the fact is that we're both
[01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:38.360]  dealing with traitors you know you have traitors in your government we have
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:42.840]  traitors not just outside our government but inside our government to you know
[01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:47.520]  corruption is a form of treason so at the end of the day you know you have
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:52.880]  people defecting they're being bought this is in Syria they're being bought by
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:58.240]  the UK which has pledged now another five million pounds to go to try to fuel
[01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:02.600]  the war in Syria and you have also the US pledging money you have cut our
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:07.200]  pledging money and if this was a grassroots movement why would it need so
[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:13.520]  many fighters and so many weapons and so much money from foreigners not Syrian
[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:18.800]  people you know I've seen revolutions happen without such things grassroots
[01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:22.600]  where millions of people have striked and said what they wanted but that's not
[01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:28.520]  what's happening in Syria and globally speaking you know Syria is not a country
[01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:32.840]  that is a new world order country we do we do not ascribe to them and so they
[01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:37.280]  call us a rogue state and they want to push us to be in line with everybody
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:42.000]  else and this is what this is all about you know when they want their regional
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:47.040]  global war to happen they want to be able to control both sides and al-Qaeda is
[01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:51.280]  about controlling the side of the Muslims and if they can get all the Muslims to
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:56.160]  be under the banner of al-Qaeda just like they tried to get the Iraqi
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:03:00.320]  resistance in Iraq to be under the banner of al-Qaeda so they didn't succeed then
[01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:04.360]  they can control both sides of the war and they can keep it going on and on and
[01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:10.320]  on so I think that's that's really what I wanted to say you know we're all
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:18.080]  fighting the same creature and I hope that you know we will be victorious
[01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:22.680]  well Syrian girl you're right how can people check out your Twitter Facebook
[01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:26.240]  YouTube channels give out that contact info for people that want to learn more
[01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:33.600]  about your reporting my YouTube is Syrian girl partisan and partisan is
[01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:41.160]  within us and there's no spaces and partisan girl is my Twitter and partisan
[01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:45.400]  girl is my Facebook as well so if you find any one of them you'll find me
[01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:49.960]  other ones well charging up al-Qaeda and giving them all this power is
[01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:54.600]  incredibly dangerous and our media thinks we're so stupid in a year they'll
[01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:58.000]  be saying we've got to go into Syria because al-Qaeda runs it and al-Qaeda
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:02.200]  blew up this blew up that so we've got to surveil the American people it's
[01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:06.600]  incredibly transparent and if it's if our criminal government would run al-Qaeda
[01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:09.840]  they would run the mass shootings and they have they would run fast and furious
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:13.720]  they could do anything and they have and this is not our government this is the
[01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:16.760]  globalist doing this they hate the Syrians they hate the American people

[01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:33.680]  about six years time just flies seems like yesterday I started out on Access
[01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:39.400]  TV 17 years ago and almost immediately got a local radio show and then got
[01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:48.080]  syndicated a few years ago I guess in 1998 just amazing 14 years and here the
[01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:51.000]  show is just growing and growing because people will hear the show think was
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:54.880]  really radical in the past and now they've seen so much of it come true I
[01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:58.200]  was like oh Alex Jones says they've got plans to use troops on the American
[01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:03.320]  people now they're rolling it out on the streets of America US Army tactical
[01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:07.600]  manuals describe how to control domestic insurrection yeah the Tea Party is
[01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:12.080]  through they say and they believe Al Qaeda will link up in the Army training
[01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:16.880]  manuals and the War College documents this is public they they publicly
[01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:22.520]  publish this the Tea Party is going to link up wait for it with Al Qaeda I mean
[01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:26.960]  the Tea Party on average is the most Islamophobic group you could imagine
[01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:31.960]  it's amazing how dumb they think we are meanwhile the Pentagon the globalist
[01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:39.400]  run Al Qaeda and admitted in the news and the CFR said quote we need Al Qaeda oh
[01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:44.360]  well I will not pledge allegiance to Al Qaeda so call me anti-american if you
[01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:48.840]  want because in the new America we have reached 1984 Al Qaeda is evil and
[01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:53.000]  hiding under every table so TSA has to molest your children and and and and
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:59.520]  fondle your wife and you and but at the same time Al Qaeda are heroes and Libby
[01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:04.280]  and Syria but they're bad and going to link up with the Tea Party anyone that
[01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:07.760]  believes that if you're a new listener by the way that came out in was all over
[01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:14.120]  mainstream news just just this week and we reported on or others did the report
[01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:18.960]  of Army training to take on Tea Party insurrection just pipe that in you'll
[01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:24.560]  get you'll get mainstream news on it not just us and actually in the mainstream
[01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:28.000]  news or like maybe we should get ready for them and they say we could link up
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:32.880]  with Al Qaeda so sure well I'm not linking up with Al Qaeda I mean I'm not
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:36.840]  NATO or the Pentagon I I didn't create Al Qaeda like the Pentagon did I didn't
[01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:39.960]  use them against the Russians or against the Serbs or against everybody else I
[01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:43.360]  didn't use them against the United States they could take our liberties here
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:48.040]  domestically I've interviewed the head of the US Embassy who was ordered to give
[01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:51.120]  them waivers to get them into the United States and was told their CIA agents
[01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:54.600]  and then the head of the Defense Language School Colonel Butler went out and
[01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:58.040]  said Muhammad out of train in our base something's going on the government's
[01:11:58.040 --> 01:12:01.640]  involved they began a court martial on him until he shut up and then he's like
[01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:04.560]  on the witness protection program or something they don't want you and then
[01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:08.200]  another guy who saw them putting bombs in the buildings well they told him bombs
[01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:11.960]  in the buildings he died a few weeks after coming on the show I was buried
[01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:15.840]  Jennings the deputy head of New York emergency management in building seven
[01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:19.960]  you know I just think we got some pretty bad people running things you know the
[01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:23.440]  type that ship 20,000 guns and hang grenades into Mexico to blame the
[01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:27.480]  Second Amendment so that's some of the news up there and a carbon agenda set
[01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:31.720]  stage for rolling blackouts in California back to the old Enron scams cut off
[01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:35.280]  the power so they can charge you more they found that that creates the
[01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:39.200]  perception of scarcity that came out in the Enron documents in 12 years later
[01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:44.080]  they're back they're back surveillance cameras turned off during seek-tipple
[01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:47.600]  shooting but the Attorney General is there right now at services feeding off
[01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:50.800]  of it a guy who said his deputy Attorney General he wants to ban the Second
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:55.100]  Amendment massive IRS fraud scheme allows the illegals to grab billions I told
[01:12:55.100 --> 01:12:58.200]  you about this last week before it broke I never got our story out but it's a
[01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:01.560]  lot bigger than just giving them fake IDs they're then allowed to take other
[01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:06.840]  people social security numbers merge the two you know they don't match and the
[01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:14.160]  system is then prosecuting or going after shutting down the bank accounts of
[01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:20.200]  the citizen who they enable the illegal to take your identity I mean man that is
[01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:23.880]  that you never can underestimate the banker occupiers and how they want to
[01:13:23.880 --> 01:13:28.240]  destroy this country 22 billion to ship General Motors in China those
[01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:34.000]  Cadillacs made in China so a cop strip search mom forcibly now this is out of
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:38.480]  the Broward Palm Beach new times but I can't even really say this on air it was
[01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:43.400]  that the woman was that time of the month and they pulled the feminine product
[01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:47.600]  out of her body and I'm very proud of their activities and so the TSA is
[01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:50.880]  leading the way now because they now do that they take women in private areas and
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:55.760]  make them remove things colostomy bags all ladies are forced to stand and then
[01:13:55.760 --> 01:13:59.320]  they make other slaves pick them up if they can't stand it's all part of our
[01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:02.560]  humiliation 11 things that can happen when you allow your country to become
[01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:07.600]  enslaved to bankers that's all up at prisonplanet.com and info wars.com and
[01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:11.560]  then in the last 20 minutes of the show today after our guest leaves us I
[01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:16.520]  promised them back to take calls we are going to premiere because there's I got
[01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:19.200]  like 20 minutes of footage of this they're back there grabbing off my
[01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:22.480]  cell phone takes a while to encode it for whatever reason they're cutting it
[01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:26.960]  down to like seven eight minutes we're going to play a drone I got drone today
[01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:32.520]  driving in from up to 90 into Austin and then there was a big traffic backup
[01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:36.480]  because of a wreck and the truck police checkpoint so I barely made it here I may
[01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:41.800]  have to just move back into town because the new checkpoints and such a free
[01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:46.960]  country I tell you it's so free I mean I got up close folks I I'm driving I go
[01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:52.720]  that's a drone right over the road so that is coming up we're gonna break that
[01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:57.960]  down but for the next hour and 20 minutes as I said we are joined by a guy

[01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:38.600]  and then give us the latest on the loving DOJ oh what the the basis for
[01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:44.280]  writing the book was the fact that I started to see a pattern in 2006 I got
[01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:51.160]  out of my last mortgage in August of or October rather of 2006 right before it
[01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:54.720]  was gonna reset itself was one of those adjustable rate mortgages basically what
[01:17:54.720 --> 01:17:59.840]  was happening is in 2003 when this whole nonsense started the promotion had been
[01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:03.960]  that everybody needed to and you know this is part of the the brain game where
[01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:06.600]  they put this idea in your head that you need to own a house and it doesn't
[01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:09.720]  matter you know whether you have a job or not that's why they have ninja loans
[01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:13.440]  which is no job no income no assets and life and they now have that for cars
[01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:16.320]  everywhere else exactly and you just tell us how much money you want to make
[01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:19.000]  and we'll put it down and we'll get you alone for that and they've got these
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:22.600]  programs out there that are all tied to the securitization market and they use
[01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:26.080]  a vehicle called mortgage electronic registrations and then they tie these
[01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:30.160]  packages of total crud and get government to invest your pension and
[01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:33.160]  everything else and then holds you hostage exactly and then you find out
[01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:36.360]  your 401k's been depleted and they're paying you back a 10 cents on the dollar
[01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:40.200]  after you sue them so in essence that's how this but they don't care because they
[01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:44.760]  got the fees swapping all the derivatives crud 50 plus the SWAT team
[01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:48.280]  standing by if you don't like it that's 50 trillion dollars they made off
[01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:51.440]  derivatives by the way you don't add in here you're a Vietnam veteran combat
[01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:55.040]  veteran well what is it like for you to see the country become this this corrupt
[01:18:55.040 --> 01:19:00.200]  well you know from a Vietnam vets point of view it it's sad that we have to see
[01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:03.160]  all of this stuff that we're over there I mean first off most of the vets in in
[01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:06.800]  Vietnam didn't even know why they were there and most of the stuff I was
[01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:09.840]  involved in was involved with Army Security Agency so I don't talk about
[01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:14.360]  that so just one of these things where you know as far as combat goes you know
[01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:17.880]  we didn't see a lot of that we were more behind the scenes you were more

[01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:16.360]  up break down how the scam worked what happened what mirrors is and then let's
[01:25:16.360 --> 01:25:20.440]  get into the usual suspect I mean it seems like everything the attorney
[01:25:20.440 --> 01:25:24.200]  general is involved in it even back during Clinton with his law firm his
[01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:27.760]  deputy attorney general getting all this change where this is going and let's get
[01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:32.200]  into the Patriot mythology getting a lot of people in trouble versus real stuff
[01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:38.000]  that's in your book and then let's take phone calls sure well Alex the the
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:44.480]  thing started in 1995 it was a concept of how can we basically control and
[01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:50.480]  track and transfer these mortgage notes on Wall Street and so Fannie Mae Freddie
[01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:55.120]  Mack the mortgage bankers Association American Land Title Association and all
[01:25:55.120 --> 01:25:59.320]  the major banks got together and came up with a game plan and they got
[01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:04.040]  Covington and Burling a law firm in Washington DC to issue an opinion letter
[01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:07.880]  and basically what it did was it gave what we call mortgage electronic
[01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:12.000]  ration registration systems or MERS credence to do what it's doing in America
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:18.480]  and what in essence happens is that when you go to the closing table and you
[01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:22.240]  sign this piece of paper which represents a mortgage or deed of trust
[01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:26.760]  there's an 18-digit min number or MERS identification number that is the
[01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:31.240]  property of MERS corp holding zinc that appears near the document title and the
[01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:34.480]  things that we've been trying to do is to get people to recognize this which is
[01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:37.800]  one of the fundamental reasons I wrote the book because you know if you knew
[01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:43.640]  what the consequences were of getting a MERS loan or MERS mortgage MERS doesn't
[01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:48.320]  have anything to do with the actual mortgage note itself MERS actually only
[01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:54.160]  is a computer database that for all intents and purposes tracks the sales of
[01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:58.640]  these repetitively as they occur on Wall Street between the parties the
[01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:02.600]  unfortunate thing about MERS which it admits by the way is that it is not a
[01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:06.880]  substitute for the land records all it is is an electronic database that is used
[01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:11.200]  by its membership subscribers which is kind of like the credit bureaus if you
[01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:15.200]  ever wonder who inputs the data on the credit reports well this is all these
[01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:18.840]  member subscribers of the credit bureaus that have access to this information
[01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:23.280]  and the credit bureau is entrusted to the Fair Credit Reporting Act to
[01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:26.680]  basically keep track and make sure that everything that's being reported is
[01:27:26.680 --> 01:27:32.840]  accurate which is why we have the dispute process you know to look at it
[01:27:32.840 --> 01:27:37.440]  just the opposite MERS does not have this kind of government regulation as do
[01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:42.520]  the banks they you know it's not a real deed registration they they created it
[01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:46.400]  so they could run these scams and sell the deeds over and over again well they
[01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:50.000]  sell the mortgage notes over and over again exactly so how many times exactly
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.560]  but it's the same bit but I mean same thing in the final equation oh isn't it
[01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:57.760]  well actually no your your mortgage note it was really sad to hear that and I
[01:27:57.760 --> 01:28:00.440]  know they're two different things but they come back to court and try to take
[01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:03.440]  your house with it exactly well they try to come with part of the equation not
[01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:06.600]  all of it and this is one of the things that the attorneys who are studying this
[01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:09.360]  stuff and they're sharing this information with me are telling me is
[01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:12.840]  that they're trying to get the entire equation put together and do it in such a
[01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:15.800]  way that the judge will believe it because right now so they're engaged in
[01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:20.680]  perjury and fraud but a constructive fraud but the issue here is that for
[01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:23.960]  years now they're getting their clocks clean and courts all over the place and
[01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:27.120]  that's what you break down on your book a lot of them have been we've had a few
[01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:32.040]  significant cases where the homeowners of one and we just had a Rico style
[01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:37.720]  action happened down in in in the Gulf Coast of Florida we have an appellate
[01:28:37.720 --> 01:28:41.720]  attorney down there in Englewood that actually won a case it's Elizabeth
[01:28:41.720 --> 01:28:45.880]  Corson and you know it's been circulating around the internet I'm sure if you
[01:28:45.880 --> 01:28:51.760]  type in Corson COURSE and you'll see that case we actually defeated a motion to
[01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:56.080]  dismiss there on the appellate level basically we reversed it so you know
[01:28:56.080 --> 01:28:59.560]  we're having a few victories and then of course we have some of the sad
[01:28:59.560 --> 01:29:03.000]  consequences of what happens to people when they go in and they try and fight
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:06.400]  this thing on their own and they file documents in the land records that are
[01:29:06.400 --> 01:29:10.360]  not appropriate and as I was sharing with you before we went on the air Alex
[01:29:10.360 --> 01:29:16.200]  this woman in California filed a document in the land records in an attempt to
[01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:20.480]  stop a foreclosure of her parents home and now she was convicted of two felony
[01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:23.680]  counts and sentenced to a year in jail yeah stay there we're gonna come back
[01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:27.280]  and break that down because there are people out there on the internet that
[01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:30.960]  will tell you to do stuff like this this is the power of common law you're
[01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:36.280]  filing and swearing to something and you may tell you it's fraud if it's not
[01:29:36.280 --> 01:29:40.680]  true now the banks are doing it but just because they're engaged in fraud doesn't
[01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:45.280]  mean we now run to beat them and engage in fraud so we're gonna break down the
[01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:49.440]  right way to do it versus the wrong way and take your phone call stay with us
[01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:58.560]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[01:30:00.120 --> 01:30:05.000]  the worst drought in 50 years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks

[01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:22.800]  hundreds of trillions of dollars worldwide by the Chinese government
[01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:29.680]  Russian government European governments pension funds and this is also done in
[01:33:29.680 --> 01:33:33.440]  Europe to some extent it's not as bad as here but some countries even worse what
[01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:39.760]  I've read to where it's all just fraudulent I remember they make you put
[01:33:39.760 --> 01:33:46.000]  money in escrow to pay your your property taxes first house like 14 years
[01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:49.600]  ago I moved into it's a little bitty house and I had put my money in about a
[01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:52.480]  year later I was told your but your mortgage has been sold two or three
[01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:56.040]  times it's finally Bank of America every few months it was a new place to you
[01:33:56.040 --> 01:34:01.440]  know back then it was actually said to check in and then they said you don't
[01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:04.560]  have $3,000 or wherever it was an escrow and I went and checked the records we
[01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:08.400]  did they've taken the money and they were gonna then they were letting me know
[01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:13.080]  they were starting proceedings to take the house that I'd put money down on and
[01:34:13.080 --> 01:34:17.400]  been paying on for you know year and a half or so and I had to go get a lawyer
[01:34:17.400 --> 01:34:22.040]  and send them a letter and threaten Bank of America but imagine old ladies or
[01:34:22.040 --> 01:34:24.600]  people that don't know what they're doing I'm not I'm certainly no rocket
[01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:28.680]  scientist especially 14 years ago I've learned a lot since then but you see the
[01:34:28.680 --> 01:34:31.960]  cases on the news I mean we've played these here for like seeing in where they
[01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:35.960]  took in Florida a $1.2 million house that had been paid for a decade plus
[01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:40.800]  before with cash never had a securitized note that had been sold out in the
[01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:44.640]  market explain this to people and let's get in as you were to the Patriot
[01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:49.400]  mythology some of the stuff where declare yourself a sovereign of the realm of
[01:34:49.400 --> 01:34:54.040]  the Lord and file it and then they'll just come arrest you because that's no
[01:34:54.040 --> 01:34:58.360]  different than what the bankers are doing if they're engaged in fraud you
[01:34:58.360 --> 01:35:02.800]  don't go file something else you need to get this book folks because this has
[01:35:02.800 --> 01:35:06.280]  got a bunch of the cases that have actually succeeded and there's different
[01:35:06.280 --> 01:35:12.840]  types of fraud going on but please continue Dave oh sometimes gets very
[01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:16.400]  ugly we see cases like the one in Stannis
[01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:20.640]  lost County California where the woman is trying to protect her parents house
[01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:25.600]  it's in the final stages of foreclosure and you know these well-meaning souls
[01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:29.880]  out there I call them Patriot paralegals type up these documents thinking that
[01:35:29.880 --> 01:35:35.200]  they can use the UCC common law and basically they move outside of the
[01:35:35.200 --> 01:35:40.920]  system's tools to attempt to enforce their way on the system and the system
[01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:45.640]  immediately recognizes that it's not within you know kosher systems exactly
[01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:48.640]  and this is what causes the problems and as a result of her filing these
[01:35:48.640 --> 01:35:53.200]  documents in Stannis lost County the district attorney had her prosecuted
[01:35:53.200 --> 01:35:57.240]  we've had instances numerous instances that I've run across in the state of
[01:35:57.240 --> 01:36:01.760]  Texas where somebody has gone in and written and filed affidavits after the
[01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:05.720]  trustees deed the property was foreclosed on it was sold the trustees deed
[01:36:05.720 --> 01:36:10.000]  was filed and so instead of fighting it at the detainer hearing which would be
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:13.000]  the next thing let's kick you out of your house and so we have to go get it do
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:16.560]  what we call a forcible detainer hearing and what ends up happening is
[01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:20.560]  this particular person files a whole series of documents starting with an
[01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:24.560]  affidavit rescinding everything that's already been foreclosed on well it's a
[01:36:24.560 --> 01:36:29.720]  little late for that and when she went to the County clerk to record it there
[01:36:29.720 --> 01:36:32.480]  was somebody who didn't even work in the clerk's office that looked at the
[01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:36.800]  documentation and said I don't think I file that stuff if I were you she went
[01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:40.000]  ahead and did it anyway and when when I got to looking at it I was just like
[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:44.520]  scratching my head going this is paralleling the case in Stannis lost
[01:36:44.520 --> 01:36:48.320]  County a judge literally get through well I mean there are a bunch of scammers I
[01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:52.200]  know a bunch of patriot paralegals who are winning in court and are having
[01:36:52.200 --> 01:36:56.360]  success but they're following cases that have won they're following you know
[01:36:56.360 --> 01:36:59.600]  systems that are there so there there is success there as well but there's a
[01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:03.320]  bunch of lawyers I mean I've seen me that you've countless cases now that are
[01:37:03.320 --> 01:37:07.840]  having victories the point is you want to go with real instruments that point
[01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:12.920]  out the fraud the bankers are engaged in don't counter their fraud with your own
[01:37:12.920 --> 01:37:16.400]  made-up garbage well look at it look at the County land records as a sacred
[01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:21.120]  vault of documents that basically represent a person's chain of title
[01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:24.800]  from the time they took possession of it and were given a warranty deed all the
[01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:29.000]  way up to the current state in condition of title and through these chain of
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:33.800]  title assessment seminars and stuff that I do I teach people to go in and
[01:37:33.800 --> 01:37:38.800]  analyze step-by-step from the warranty deed forward to see how many times the
[01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:42.120]  chain of title has been affected one of the things we're seeing is the more you
[01:37:42.120 --> 01:37:48.560]  go out and borrow and refi and refi and get a HELOC and refi the worst condition
[01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:52.280]  the chain of title becomes because you have more outside third parties
[01:37:52.280 --> 01:37:56.800]  interfering in the chain and filing documents that appear to be legitimate
[01:37:56.800 --> 01:38:00.160]  when there anything but let me ask you this how bad does it get because I've
[01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:03.280]  a dead different economists and experts and lawyers on some of the lawyers that
[01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:08.400]  have won in court that you mentioned in your book and they they talk about how
[01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:11.800]  many times in derivatives these securitized loans are being sold and
[01:38:11.800 --> 01:38:15.480]  the fraud that these groups are holding how many times are they selling these
[01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:19.720]  titles on average well the notes are basically on Wall Street Alex are
[01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:24.880]  being taken and spun over anywhere from 9 to 30 times maybe more we don't know
[01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:28.880]  because they're hidden in the MERS system the MERS electronic database keeps
[01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:32.200]  track of all the transfers but none of these are recorded in the land records
[01:38:32.200 --> 01:38:36.280]  and this is what's causing the problems with the 70s it's a title and they
[01:38:36.280 --> 01:38:39.240]  come take houses in some cases not just where you're behind and then they
[01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:43.000]  fraudulently do it where they just take houses that they never even had anything
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.800]  to well it could have been because of the fact that when they when they and I
[01:38:45.800 --> 01:38:49.200]  was talking to a title guy in Cleveland yesterday and he told me that we see a
[01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:52.680]  lot of problems and mistakes that were done because somebody who is preparing
[01:38:52.680 --> 01:38:56.120]  the warranty deed put the wrong legal description on and they basically when
[01:38:56.120 --> 01:38:59.600]  they filed the warranty deed all of a sudden it looked like that there could
[01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:03.800]  be a potential slander of someone else's title and so when you're looking at a
[01:39:03.800 --> 01:39:08.320]  edit at a legal description that all of a sudden should say lock lot six block
[01:39:08.320 --> 01:39:11.760]  seven but it says because of the the fact that you know they were having a
[01:39:11.760 --> 01:39:14.280]  bad day and look cross-eyed at the computer didn't have enough coffee and
[01:39:14.280 --> 01:39:17.960]  hit lot seven block seven all of a sudden now we have a lien on the wrong
[01:39:17.960 --> 01:39:22.040]  property and this is where you see a lot of this back oh yeah I saw cases
[01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:26.480]  speaking California in LA they're now having thousands of cases a year of
[01:39:26.480 --> 01:39:31.720]  innocent people being arrested because they just put your name in a bank robber
[01:39:31.720 --> 01:39:36.680]  or a child molesters area and now your lives ruined and and and it's so it's
[01:39:36.680 --> 01:39:41.760]  like it's it's so Byzantine that no one can fix it it's gonna take at least a
[01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:45.840]  century to fix this problem if we can stop MERS now and I do know that there
[01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:50.880]  is a movement afoot by many legislatures to try to cut the MERS equation out of
[01:39:50.880 --> 01:39:54.920]  the recordation process in in so then what does that do to all the derivatives
[01:39:54.920 --> 01:39:57.640]  based on it worldwide well the derivatives generally don't have
[01:39:57.640 --> 01:40:00.400]  anything to do with what's in the land records there are two distinct entities
[01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:04.280]  but I mean you literally could go out if you wanted to if it was available you
[01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:07.520]  literally could bet against the weather you could say well you know what I I
[01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:10.920]  know that it's gonna rain tomorrow but I'm gonna bet against the fact it's gonna
[01:40:10.920 --> 01:40:14.400]  rain bet that it's gonna be sunny so that when it when it comes to find out
[01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:18.160]  that it's not sunny I'm gonna collect I'm gonna go in and I'm a collect on that
[01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:22.960]  bet this is kind of what they did when they structured these loans no I know
[01:40:22.960 --> 01:40:27.000]  but but but I mean if MERS goes under they'll lose even more of the cases my
[01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:32.680]  point is all this fraud is based on this fraudulent filing system so and and
[01:40:32.680 --> 01:40:35.880]  when I've read the big banks are still doing this yes they are and this is a
[01:40:35.880 --> 01:40:39.080]  thing that we have to you know I get the only thing I could do to I because I
[01:40:39.080 --> 01:40:41.920]  can't give you legal advice I'm a paralegal I'm not an attorney but
[01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:45.200]  having looked at this from a journalist perspective the only thing that we can do
[01:40:45.200 --> 01:40:50.000]  is say no to MERS mortgages just say I'm sorry but I'm not gonna sign any
[01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:53.480]  mortgage paperwork if MERS is involved so anybody that's going to buy a house
[01:40:53.480 --> 01:40:57.280]  anyone that's going to sell a house any five or refi or that already has a house
[01:40:57.280 --> 01:41:01.040]  with a mortgage you need to get the book clouded titles at info warshop.com and

[01:41:53.880 --> 01:41:57.320]  stacks of legalese and if I just to announce this and that and file this

[01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:11.120]  file a billion dollar lien on this or that and and of course nothing ever
[01:42:11.120 --> 01:42:15.840]  really succeeds but it's it's almost like magic it's almost like that you
[01:42:15.840 --> 01:42:21.640]  know thinking a Harry Potter book or a Ouija board is real and again it Larry
[01:42:21.640 --> 01:42:24.640]  Bcraft is a great lawyer in Patriot he's talked about this there are real
[01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:28.520]  things to fight these crooks and they are lawless but again just because the
[01:42:28.520 --> 01:42:33.360]  system is lawless it still has the establishment mantle to it and we're
[01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:37.440]  breaking through that but you just don't fight it with whole cloth new
[01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:42.040]  theorem that's been a big problem Alex and when people go into the courthouse
[01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:46.160]  and take this system upon themselves and do what you know we're hearing about
[01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:49.840]  now another horror story is these administrative processes that people are
[01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:53.040]  filing in in the land records and they're filing you know what they're
[01:42:53.040 --> 01:42:56.560]  apparently trying to take something to the international court and like the
[01:42:56.560 --> 01:43:00.920]  Hague is gonna the Hague doesn't care about this stuff the problem that we're
[01:43:00.920 --> 01:43:04.560]  don't you just I mean I mean I mean there are procedures to sue banks when
[01:43:04.560 --> 01:43:08.640]  they've lied or isn't it where they violated the paperwork and violated
[01:43:08.640 --> 01:43:11.760]  your rights at the original time of signing I mean there's a lot of ways
[01:43:11.760 --> 01:43:15.480]  to go after them well you know we've seen attorneys do non-disclosure suits
[01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:18.920]  because nobody was told that MERS was there at the time and what they were
[01:43:18.920 --> 01:43:22.040]  for people went in and they were so interested in getting the keys they just
[01:43:22.040 --> 01:43:24.440]  signed their life away you literally could have put in there
[01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:29.360]  borrower agrees to give us his firstborn one year after this loan you know is
[01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:33.360]  in force and effect and they would just sell and a fraudulent contract is no
[01:43:33.360 --> 01:43:36.480]  involved yeah but they don't read it and that's the problem people do not read
[01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:39.480]  and understand what they're signing they go to the closing table they want the
[01:43:39.480 --> 01:43:43.000]  keys you know they've tried like the dickens to get a loan mod and why would
[01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:46.240]  you do a loan modification with a bank that doesn't even own your note that's
[01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:50.040]  another big problem we're having but okay well just give us a smattering as
[01:43:50.040 --> 01:43:53.800]  I've had a bunch of these lawyers on before a smattering of things that are
[01:43:53.800 --> 01:43:57.000]  winning in court things that are six things to I mean obviously it's all in
[01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:01.800]  the book but things to look for well if you see documents filed in the land
[01:44:01.800 --> 01:44:06.800]  records and we see most of the problems having to do with assignments this is a
[01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:10.440]  big problem because when when they finally do come out of the closet these
[01:44:10.440 --> 01:44:13.200]  these people on Wall Street that are playing in the derivatives markets and
[01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:17.440]  they record a document in the land records generally we're seeing that
[01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:21.280]  it's five or six years past that the actual date the note should have been
[01:44:21.280 --> 01:44:24.840]  conveyed into the pool and this is a big problem and the big arguments that
[01:44:24.840 --> 01:44:28.680]  are being one now is arguments having to do with whether or not this falls
[01:44:28.680 --> 01:44:32.400]  under uniform commercial code at section 3 or whether it falls under sections
[01:44:32.400 --> 01:44:36.480]  8 and 9 because sections 8 and 9 basically for those unlearned have to do
[01:44:36.480 --> 01:44:40.800]  with non-negotiable instruments and so when I look at these situations and I
[01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:47.200]  see that a note has been taken out of the realm of an article 3 UCC and put
[01:44:47.200 --> 01:44:50.560]  into article 9 and has been panned on Wall Street and sold and resold and the
[01:44:50.560 --> 01:44:54.720]  borrower has no idea then that in of itself sure it's issues that attorneys
[01:44:54.720 --> 01:44:57.880]  are sure also they're successful but I mean I know you all you know all the
[01:44:57.880 --> 01:45:01.080]  finer details but elaborate on this point and then the others that you're
[01:45:01.080 --> 01:45:06.120]  about to cover what about where they have lawyers for the banks come in and
[01:45:06.120 --> 01:45:10.880]  lie and say that they have all the proof and chain of custody and ownership and
[01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:15.040]  all of this and they're not I mean can't you also get them on that there have
[01:45:15.040 --> 01:45:20.480]  been movements in the states now specifically New York and Nevada Nevada
[01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:24.940]  came out with a B assembly bill 284 which basically says that if you file
[01:45:24.940 --> 01:45:30.520]  phony documents in a court case in that state and it can be shown that these
[01:45:30.520 --> 01:45:34.120]  documents are not legitimate that the attorney could be disbarred and be
[01:45:34.120 --> 01:45:39.440]  facing jail time it's a felony wasn't that already on the books it was it's
[01:45:39.440 --> 01:45:42.800]  like saying pass laws yeah last year but but it's like saying pass a law in
[01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:46.480]  Texas the TSA can't grab your genitals there's already laws that you can't do
[01:45:46.480 --> 01:45:49.920]  that I mean I mean there's there's got to be laws in all the states I've seen
[01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:53.880]  some of them where where you get in trouble for filing false documents well
[01:45:53.880 --> 01:45:58.160]  yes fraud there are perjury yeah we have quitam actions that have been filed all
[01:45:58.160 --> 01:46:02.400]  over the country specifically in California can't somebody do that is
[01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:05.120]  not even a party that's what that is right yeah the quitam basically is a
[01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:09.280]  whistleblower action and they basically go out and say okay I'm I'm the I
[01:46:09.280 --> 01:46:14.000]  declare that I have information and based on that information I'm filing a
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:17.440]  suit that all of these things are false claims those into themselves are legal
[01:46:17.440 --> 01:46:23.080]  but they're the attorneys I'm talking to that filed these claims years ago are
[01:46:23.080 --> 01:46:28.000]  now running into problems with them and it all falls back on UCC article 9 as to
[01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:31.280]  whether or not these are negotiable instruments under 3 or non-negotiable
[01:46:31.280 --> 01:46:36.720]  most of the victories against the bankers where is it successful agency the
[01:46:36.720 --> 01:46:40.360]  thing we're seeing now is if you can defeat and you can split or separate
[01:46:40.360 --> 01:46:45.040]  the relationship between the entities that are filing these documents and the
[01:46:45.040 --> 01:46:48.280]  entities that claim to hold the note if you can split these things in other
[01:46:48.280 --> 01:46:52.200]  words when the trust themselves come back in and if you look in your
[01:46:52.200 --> 01:46:56.000]  assignment and you see an assignment that says this note has been assigned to
[01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:00.300]  and there's some gobbledygook all the way to you know formerly known as
[01:47:00.300 --> 01:47:05.600]  successor by merger to as trustee for and then you see a number like 2007 dash
[01:47:05.600 --> 01:47:10.440]  he five or anything like that in a combination of numbers you probably are
[01:47:10.440 --> 01:47:13.840]  dealing with a trust that has a pooling and servicing agreement and this is what
[01:47:13.840 --> 01:47:17.960]  these attorneys like Mark Dan the former Ohio AG who's winning a lot of cases in
[01:47:17.960 --> 01:47:21.360]  Ohio and he's going in and he's dissecting the pooling and servicing
[01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:25.160]  agreement and running it into court and the judges even though they're not
[01:47:25.160 --> 01:47:30.160]  focused on securitization per se New York trust law has a foundation in this
[01:47:30.160 --> 01:47:34.080]  in these securitizations well I mean the system has to write this or it will
[01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:37.480]  destroy confidence in everything exactly and and people are starting to get a
[01:47:37.480 --> 01:47:40.240]  little disgusted with it especially when they find out stuff a little
[01:47:40.240 --> 01:47:43.800]  disgusting it well that's what I'm saying right now we have to we have to use a
[01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:47.200]  logical head Alex we can't go out and do some of the stuff that's going to get
[01:47:47.200 --> 01:47:50.080]  you thrown in jail we've got to be reasonable with this and we've got to
[01:47:50.080 --> 01:47:54.560]  take this thing and there is a methodology to this a method to the
[01:47:54.560 --> 01:47:56.880]  madness now now what about and we're going to break and come back and take
[01:47:56.880 --> 01:47:59.640]  calls what about the system countering I know they're trying to get some state
[01:47:59.640 --> 01:48:02.760]  laws passed the same years is okay I know they're trying to get the feds to
[01:48:02.760 --> 01:48:06.080]  have an agreement with attorney generals I know that they're trying to kind of
[01:48:06.080 --> 01:48:10.160]  cobble over and paper over this how is the system countering this how are they
[01:48:10.160 --> 01:48:15.080]  trying to keep the scam going well the bigger picture is there the lack of
[01:48:15.080 --> 01:48:19.480]  prosecution that in of itself when you don't put the bad boys in jail the
[01:48:19.480 --> 01:48:23.680]  process you know the dirty work keeps going on so you know we come back to
[01:48:23.680 --> 01:48:27.600]  what we discussed first about Lanny and Eric and all the boys at the DOJ who
[01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:32.320]  used to be you know basically partners with Covington and Burling this law
[01:48:32.320 --> 01:48:36.720]  firm in DC that wrote the opinion letter for MERS when you look at the bigger
[01:48:36.720 --> 01:48:40.280]  picture and you look at this 27-page white paper that was just released by
[01:48:40.280 --> 01:48:44.120]  government accountability Institute they actually footnote all of the little
[01:48:44.120 --> 01:48:46.840]  causes of action that could have should have would have but never happened
[01:48:46.840 --> 01:48:53.080]  because of the relationship between the DOJ the SEC and but now isn't that just
[01:48:53.080 --> 01:48:56.320]  the moral authority of the public waking up and juries and things that are
[01:48:56.320 --> 01:49:01.440]  involved and the fact that now it's almost like a public tort warning that
[01:49:01.440 --> 01:49:05.120]  now they've been told stop doing this does that add any way to stop them it
[01:49:05.120 --> 01:49:09.960]  doesn't certain jurisdictions we notice that like New York for example a lot of
[01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:14.080]  the judges in the five boroughs like Arthur Schack they won't put up with
[01:49:14.080 --> 01:49:18.200]  this stuff and they know Robo signing when they see it I virtually if Arthur
[01:49:18.200 --> 01:49:21.520]  Schack would come to work for me he'd probably be one of the best fraud spotters
[01:49:21.520 --> 01:49:25.440]  in the country again we go to Robo signing that's been that's been ruled
[01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:29.320]  of still going on it's been ruled a fraud still and Obama's using a robot to
[01:49:29.320 --> 01:49:34.160]  sign now he has a as a matter of fact a Robo signer on his deed you know his
[01:49:34.160 --> 01:49:37.960]  mortgage in Illinois he but he's signing mills with a robot now too he
[01:49:37.960 --> 01:49:41.440]  probably has a signing machine a lot of them do and then they're using signing
[01:49:41.440 --> 01:49:46.160]  machines to sign the Robo so no he'll be in Hawaii and just say sign that bill
[01:49:46.160 --> 01:49:49.900]  that he shouldn't be able to do that well if it's not in front of a notary
[01:49:49.900 --> 01:49:54.120]  go figure because notaries require the president it's all look I know what's
[01:49:54.120 --> 01:49:57.400]  going on here the globalists are clouding all this so they can bring in a
[01:49:57.400 --> 01:50:00.400]  new system later they control and just go cashless and get rid of the old
[01:50:00.400 --> 01:50:04.960]  county deed systems I'm telling you they they screw things up tie all their
[01:50:04.960 --> 01:50:08.720]  fraud everything make it too big to fail hold us hostage and then roll out more
[01:50:08.720 --> 01:50:12.200]  tyranny as a solution they would like to put us on a national registry but I
[01:50:12.200 --> 01:50:15.320]  think the states aren't buying it that's the one thing you know remember
[01:50:15.320 --> 01:50:19.520]  thank God for the founders though it's a separation of powers exactly and this is
[01:50:19.520 --> 01:50:23.600]  a problem when you're dealing with issues where the county land records have
[01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:27.040]  been there since time began in this country and now you have an electronic
[01:50:27.040 --> 01:50:30.160]  data it's one of the few things that works great in government because it's
[01:50:30.160 --> 01:50:34.520]  ancient exactly it's been it's been figured out exactly and and so when you
[01:50:34.520 --> 01:50:39.120]  have a system that comes in and is totally runs totally juxtaposed to what
[01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:43.160]  we know to be true and factual yeah we'll take our thousand-year-old system we
[01:50:43.160 --> 01:50:47.720]  don't want your little fancy dandy foreign banker flim flam you know

[01:54:21.600 --> 01:54:26.680]  cadre of women she only hires women to top positions well she likes women
[01:54:26.680 --> 01:54:31.720]  you know I like women too but the point is is that the men were told they were
[01:54:31.720 --> 01:54:37.000]  slaves basically so lawsuits are flying and we'll make her a Supreme Court
[01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:41.440]  justice it'd be nice you couldn't tell who who was who whether it was Sotomayor
[01:54:41.440 --> 01:54:46.520]  or Kagan or her we could just kind of like I mean it could be like a you know
[01:54:46.520 --> 01:54:49.520]  game where you kind of spin the three around and go which one is which and you
[01:54:49.520 --> 01:54:53.480]  can't really tell maybe we could cross all three of make a new clone that'll be
[01:54:53.480 --> 01:54:58.560]  our new ruler you tell the leader though has a little white white spot in their
[01:54:58.560 --> 01:55:02.880]  hair most super villains do have like that little mark I don't know what the
[01:55:02.880 --> 01:55:07.320]  deal is okay we're taking your phone calls here talking about the giant fraud
[01:55:07.320 --> 01:55:10.280]  and before you leave as you started getting into it we never got into it
[01:55:10.280 --> 01:55:13.920]  before you leave get into the Justice Department and our loving Attorney
[01:55:13.920 --> 01:55:16.880]  General because he's got to be he's a big part of this well being a good fellow
[01:55:16.880 --> 01:55:20.360]  from Chicago we're gonna get to it I understand well you know basically the
[01:55:20.360 --> 01:55:22.840]  word that's out on the street now through some of the reports that we're
[01:55:22.840 --> 01:55:28.560]  seeing and and we review these things on a daily basis we're looking at issues
[01:55:28.560 --> 01:55:33.920]  between the DOJ and Covington and Burling namely that the Eric Holder
[01:55:33.920 --> 01:55:37.960]  Lanny Brewer were employees or partners if you will of Covington and Burling
[01:55:37.960 --> 01:55:41.880]  which issued the opinion letter for MERS and MERS Corp so when you have the DOJ
[01:55:41.880 --> 01:55:46.840]  tied to the entity that the banks basically used to transfer all their
[01:55:46.840 --> 01:55:51.280]  their notes on Wall Street and play in the derivatives markets you have some
[01:55:51.280 --> 01:55:55.680]  real issues no that's the word I mean you get the select groups the law firms
[01:55:55.680 --> 01:55:58.800]  the accounting firms Arthur Anderson and then you can do whatever you want
[01:55:58.800 --> 01:56:01.960]  people ask well how come Mitt Romney not paid to hardly any taxes well he's
[01:56:01.960 --> 01:56:06.040]  part of the special club and and that's how the payoffs work let's go to some
[01:56:06.040 --> 01:56:09.640]  phone calls Jim in West Virginia you're on the air with our guest welcome sir
[01:56:09.640 --> 01:56:13.840]  go ahead thank you well two things utterly amazed me at their insanity you
[01:56:13.840 --> 01:56:17.240]  can make every payment but you never get the wet copy after you make all the
[01:56:17.240 --> 01:56:21.440]  payments to the note so it still isn't yours and the banks collect and or for
[01:56:21.440 --> 01:56:25.760]  clothes based on a worthless copy of the original viable note now judges know
[01:56:25.760 --> 01:56:29.520]  the difference between the note and his copy the copy is a forgery for crying
[01:56:29.520 --> 01:56:33.000]  out loud just like there's a difference between a better reserve note and a
[01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:38.680]  zero copy of the currency can you comment on this criminal insanity on a
[01:56:38.680 --> 01:56:43.840]  part of the judges and I'll just listen well the the biggest part of the
[01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:47.760]  problem that we're seeing now is you know when people bring stuff into court
[01:56:47.760 --> 01:56:53.200]  there you know the judges basically by what evidence has been presented that
[01:56:53.200 --> 01:56:57.120]  hasn't been objected to the bigger problem we're running into is a lot of
[01:56:57.120 --> 01:57:00.160]  people that go in there that get out procedure by the banks and I think this
[01:57:00.160 --> 01:57:04.440]  is where the largest part of what we're seeing is the problem you know not that
[01:57:04.440 --> 01:57:08.280]  you know pro se litigation hasn't won we had a case read versus Fannie Mae in
[01:57:08.280 --> 01:57:12.240]  California that just came out where she got a summary judgment but but to be
[01:57:12.240 --> 01:57:16.400]  clear if no one objects they could go in there basically with the back of a
[01:57:16.400 --> 01:57:20.280]  crackerjack box bring anything and say here's my proof yep bring anything they
[01:57:20.280 --> 01:57:23.960]  want and the and the court will accept it as long as you don't object to it that
[01:57:23.960 --> 01:57:27.400]  this is the general game plan and a lot and a lot of people do not understand
[01:57:27.400 --> 01:57:30.560]  when they go into court that you can literally get out procedure because
[01:57:30.560 --> 01:57:34.520]  these people have a specific game plan we have networks across the country of
[01:57:34.520 --> 01:57:39.800]  foreclosure mills that all band together and share information in a big way and I
[01:57:39.800 --> 01:57:43.200]  talk about that in the book and and so when you when you see all of this
[01:57:43.200 --> 01:57:46.680]  into called organized crime well you call it what you want but the fact of the
[01:57:46.680 --> 01:57:49.400]  matter is is it's network sharing and this is what we're trying to do on our
[01:57:49.400 --> 01:57:52.760]  end is we're coming back and we have a network of about 40 attorneys that have
[01:57:52.760 --> 01:57:56.400]  all banded together and share information and this network is growing and
[01:57:56.400 --> 01:58:00.640]  it's if there are significant players in this thing that are actually winning
[01:58:00.640 --> 01:58:04.160]  case like you said former attorney generals of states and people like that
[01:58:04.160 --> 01:58:07.480]  thank you so much caller we're gonna go to break and come back with more as we

[02:00:37.200 --> 02:00:40.160]  phone calls let's let's move to them quick 30 more minutes of calls here
[02:00:40.160 --> 02:00:45.080]  than a bunch of news and my little visit with a drone today yeah it happened I
[02:00:45.080 --> 02:00:49.800]  got footage you have to prove it let's talk to Mike in New Mexico Mike you're
[02:00:49.800 --> 02:00:59.200]  on the air welcome thank you I got a question for you I don't know about
[02:00:59.200 --> 02:01:05.240]  these reverse mortgages I'm hearing them air a lot on commercials and look like
[02:01:05.240 --> 02:01:09.000]  you're attacking a lot of senior citizens so if you guys can elaborate on
[02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:12.400]  that something look out for your mom or whatever that's a great question you
[02:01:12.400 --> 02:01:16.000]  know they're telling old folks live in your house till you die but get some
[02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:22.680]  money to live now on the house in a way maybe that's a good idea because the
[02:01:22.680 --> 02:01:25.600]  IRS will try to steal old people's houses unless it's all clouded but I'm
[02:01:25.600 --> 02:01:29.400]  not giving advice I mean I'm sure that's probably pretty predatory what's
[02:01:29.400 --> 02:01:34.400]  going on well reverse mortgages and we had a question on that some on another
[02:01:34.400 --> 02:01:39.120]  program that I was on and the woman basically was concerned about the fact
[02:01:39.120 --> 02:01:43.280]  as you say as you stated Alex that she was wondering whether or not this was a
[02:01:43.280 --> 02:01:46.800]  smart move for somebody that's getting up in years and normally when I think of
[02:01:46.800 --> 02:01:50.080]  people going into retirement I'm thinking of people that are trying to
[02:01:50.080 --> 02:01:54.920]  literally pay off their mortgage and find a passive income stream but because
[02:01:54.920 --> 02:01:58.760]  of the fact that America's financial education well you obviously didn't learn
[02:01:58.760 --> 02:02:03.520]  it in high school you actually have to instead of the school of you know of
[02:02:03.520 --> 02:02:07.760]  high school you learn it in Fort Knox or or hard knocks so to speak you
[02:02:07.760 --> 02:02:10.520]  basically learned because you've sacrificed your almighty dollars and
[02:02:10.520 --> 02:02:14.840]  have got nothing in return the bigger problem we're having is that the lack
[02:02:14.840 --> 02:02:18.720]  of education lack of financial education in this country has basically
[02:02:18.720 --> 02:02:25.680]  allowed the lending community to prey on the interest of these people and so
[02:02:25.680 --> 02:02:30.160]  they get these famous movie stars on that look trusting and they recommend
[02:02:30.160 --> 02:02:34.040]  these things and recommend these so you're saying it's a bad idea if it was
[02:02:34.040 --> 02:02:37.840]  my situation I was facing retirement I sure would be looking at another income
[02:02:37.840 --> 02:02:40.880]  stream I could think of a lot of other things to invest sure but let's say
[02:02:40.880 --> 02:02:43.840]  let's say your cancer is in remission you think you're gonna be dead in five
[02:02:43.840 --> 02:02:46.880]  years do the room you know reverse mortgage go to the Caribbean have a
[02:02:46.880 --> 02:02:50.680]  good time part of the problem is though your estate starts to diminish and
[02:02:50.680 --> 02:02:53.640]  pretty soon by the time all this has said and done your your estate is left
[02:02:53.640 --> 02:02:56.680]  with nothing I mean that's that's the but I mean yeah if you don't want to
[02:02:56.680 --> 02:03:00.960]  give your kids the money though blow it I mean it sounds bad I'm not saying
[02:03:00.960 --> 02:03:04.840]  reverse mortgages are good I don't know no much about them I'm just saying are
[02:03:04.840 --> 02:03:09.080]  they always bad in your view I generally tend to shy away from them but you know
[02:03:09.080 --> 02:03:12.640]  people have the reasons for for doing it I always tell them look if you're gonna
[02:03:12.640 --> 02:03:16.280]  do a reverse mortgage best thing to do is consult with a financial professional
[02:03:16.280 --> 02:03:21.040]  get it you're as you yeah why not shell the nicer house and move into a smaller
[02:03:21.040 --> 02:03:24.480]  apartment in a retirement community instead of getting the reverse mortgage
[02:03:24.480 --> 02:03:29.320]  my mom did that very thing she did the very same thing she took her all the
[02:03:29.320 --> 02:03:32.520]  money that she had she sold her house and of course you know her being in
[02:03:32.520 --> 02:03:36.720]  Florida she took a nosedive on that house and lost $100,000 when she
[02:03:36.720 --> 02:03:40.240]  sold it and so she took that money and put it into annuities and what she
[02:03:40.240 --> 02:03:44.360]  considered safe investments and left it there and so then she moved into an
[02:03:44.360 --> 02:03:49.600]  apartment and that way you know when it's time to settle the estate everything
[02:03:49.600 --> 02:03:53.160]  is very easy and not complicated now the average person could have said you
[02:03:53.160 --> 02:03:56.080]  know the reverse mortgage sounds good because I want to leave something to my
[02:03:56.080 --> 02:03:59.680]  kids well the downside of the reverse mortgage is the fact that it depletes
[02:03:59.680 --> 02:04:03.440]  the estate so if the intent was to leave them something well don't you think it
[02:04:03.440 --> 02:04:07.000]  would be better just to try to figure out a way to create an income stream to
[02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:11.560]  pay off the mortgage or figure out a way to you know rent the house out and
[02:04:11.560 --> 02:04:14.800]  move into an apartment so somebody else can pay that mortgage because that's
[02:04:14.800 --> 02:04:17.160]  what a lot of people do when they can't afford the house they rent it to
[02:04:17.160 --> 02:04:21.120]  somebody else and somebody else makes the mortgage payment and then they move
[02:04:21.120 --> 02:04:23.880]  into an apartment which is cheaper that they can live on and they're fixed all
[02:04:23.880 --> 02:04:26.880]  right great analysis I think that answered his question we're gonna go to
[02:04:26.880 --> 02:04:31.320]  break two more segments the next one's long we're gonna go to Mike Nathan

[02:08:26.480 --> 02:08:30.040]  edition I'm Alex Jones thank you so much for joining us if you just tuned in
[02:08:30.040 --> 02:08:33.480]  there is a mega fraud I've talked about it a decade ago people thought it was a
[02:08:33.480 --> 02:08:38.440]  conspiracy theory how they didn't have the real notes they were engaged in
[02:08:38.440 --> 02:08:43.520]  fraud they were selling into derivatives these mortgages over and over again the
[02:08:43.520 --> 02:08:48.240]  chain of custody wasn't filed the deeds weren't filed properly none of it was
[02:08:48.240 --> 02:08:51.440]  being carried out correctly well now you know the last three or four years
[02:08:51.440 --> 02:08:56.360]  that's been big news it's continuing and they're not just taking people who get
[02:08:56.360 --> 02:09:00.520]  behind on their mortgage now you pay 24 years you get behind it one month they
[02:09:00.520 --> 02:09:04.640]  take it the last year they're taking houses that are paid for and we've gone
[02:09:04.640 --> 02:09:08.480]  over a lot of examples of that and or people think their houses paid off but
[02:09:08.480 --> 02:09:11.880]  somebody bought it down the you know line and just comes and says it's mine
[02:09:11.880 --> 02:09:14.960]  and the courts take it unless you know what you're doing that's where the book
[02:09:14.960 --> 02:09:21.200]  clouded titles that we do sell info or shop com massively discounted it's a
[02:09:21.200 --> 02:09:26.280]  normally 49 95 it's 39 95 and you get a free citizen rulebook and bumper stickers
[02:09:26.280 --> 02:09:30.920]  with it but the point is it's well worth it and because it breaks down what real
[02:09:30.920 --> 02:09:35.760]  lawyers and others are doing to win and it's the latest this just came out this
[02:09:35.760 --> 02:09:43.200]  latest addition okay I want to go back to the phone calls here let's go to Mike
[02:09:43.200 --> 02:09:47.240]  and then Truth Warrior and others Mike in Wyoming you're on the air with Dave
[02:09:47.240 --> 02:09:53.080]  Krieger go ahead yeah hi Dave there's another 500 pound gorilla out there
[02:09:53.080 --> 02:09:57.760]  that's clouding title that's the IRS I was in a urinating contest with them
[02:09:57.760 --> 02:10:01.320]  for many years and I finally had to go through bankruptcy to get them off my
[02:10:01.320 --> 02:10:08.040]  back but I I'm still saddled with a big lean on my house that my bankruptcy
[02:10:08.040 --> 02:10:11.360]  attorney says I'm just I'm stuck with it there's nothing they can nothing they
[02:10:11.360 --> 02:10:16.400]  can do about it but what the IRS does is that they don't go through the normal
[02:10:16.400 --> 02:10:20.680]  procedure that's that anyone else would have to go through to file a lien with a
[02:10:20.680 --> 02:10:25.640]  county recorder the recorder just says well we just file anything as long as
[02:10:25.640 --> 02:10:31.040]  the the appropriate fee is paid they there's no certification to be specific
[02:10:31.040 --> 02:10:36.960]  is that even a mechanics lane no they have to certify that the you know that
[02:10:36.960 --> 02:10:41.040]  the information in there is accurate and they don't do that it's it's robo
[02:10:41.040 --> 02:10:44.560]  signed by someone who doesn't even exist yeah no I'm familiar with that and
[02:10:44.560 --> 02:10:48.360]  by the way this is the big scandal you saw Dave this big breaking news just had
[02:10:48.360 --> 02:10:51.840]  caveat and I'm gonna get the article out soon for three years I've been talking
[02:10:51.840 --> 02:10:55.320]  to a senior IRS person and then for over a year another but the last few months
[02:10:55.320 --> 02:11:00.600]  are like listen there's gonna be a big thing we're told to give people fake
[02:11:00.600 --> 02:11:04.520]  well I mean they're not fake but they really are fake under wrong names these
[02:11:04.520 --> 02:11:07.720]  tax IDs then they can then attach those the social security numbers aren't even
[02:11:07.720 --> 02:11:11.520]  the same and government Texas Comptroller others have released millions of
[02:11:11.520 --> 02:11:16.520]  them aren't governments are involved you name it it's shutting down the IRS but
[02:11:16.520 --> 02:11:22.920]  it's worse when the illegals do stuff in your name or whatever the IRS and
[02:11:22.920 --> 02:11:26.440]  there's this identity fraud involved will come and still take your account or
[02:11:26.440 --> 02:11:29.560]  put liens on you and they're told it doesn't matter just use it to take
[02:11:29.560 --> 02:11:33.560]  their money and the IRS is finally in a mutiny you know the biggest center in
[02:11:33.560 --> 02:11:36.960]  the country is here in Austin they are finally just going this we can't do
[02:11:36.960 --> 02:11:42.440]  this and they're taking retirees homes you name it I mean it is so this breaking
[02:11:42.440 --> 02:11:46.760]  news you see is really a whitewash is what I'm saying but what do you say to
[02:11:46.760 --> 02:11:55.280]  that Mike well my question is how isn't there a way can I do a quiet title
[02:11:55.280 --> 02:12:00.280]  action I couldn't get any attorney to to touch it the locally here is yeah how do
[02:12:00.280 --> 02:12:06.360]  you challenge the fact that it's a robo signed fraud well you know again you're
[02:12:06.360 --> 02:12:12.840]  dealing UCC largely in part deals from my understanding in article nine which is
[02:12:12.840 --> 02:12:15.920]  basically possession is nine-tenths of the law and if they can go in and seize
[02:12:15.920 --> 02:12:19.520]  whatever is in your bank account and I know that judging from what I've talked
[02:12:19.520 --> 02:12:23.520]  to attorneys about Mike on these on these issues that they're telling me that
[02:12:23.520 --> 02:12:27.560]  you know certain bankruptcy debts are dischargeable or IRS liens rather
[02:12:27.560 --> 02:12:31.600]  dischargeable in bankruptcy if they're older than three years my CPA even
[02:12:31.600 --> 02:12:34.840]  confirmed that but you know the fact of the matter is is that you know once
[02:12:34.840 --> 02:12:40.120]  liens are there there's there's certain procedures that you need to find a real
[02:12:40.120 --> 02:12:43.800]  estate attorney that understands yeah that that can go in there are people
[02:12:43.800 --> 02:12:47.200]  that aren't cowards are willing to go up against the IRS attorneys that will go
[02:12:47.200 --> 02:12:51.160]  and and challenge the existing liens on there especially if a lien has been
[02:12:51.160 --> 02:12:54.960]  discharged in bankruptcy that still is you know showing on your on your chain
[02:12:54.960 --> 02:13:00.560]  so let's save you your your homesteads save you from their clutches well it's
[02:13:00.560 --> 02:13:07.360]  that they the bankruptcy itself stops any collection activity but but that
[02:13:07.360 --> 02:13:11.920]  doesn't that doesn't make the lien just by the way Mike is a doctor and he and
[02:13:11.920 --> 02:13:15.400]  he hadn't called in a few years and you've been listing over the decade
[02:13:15.400 --> 02:13:19.760]  haven't you Mike oh yeah since the early days I recognize your voice how you
[02:13:19.760 --> 02:13:26.040]  doing oh not not not too bad unfortunately you know that you'll
[02:13:26.040 --> 02:13:32.120]  saying that a fish rots from the head down our administration here at at my
[02:13:32.120 --> 02:13:36.240]  little hospital seems to have the same infection that the that the feds have
[02:13:36.240 --> 02:13:42.120]  that they can just do pretty much whatever they want and this this mentality
[02:13:42.120 --> 02:13:47.120]  seems to be permeating our entire society yeah the more Americans go along
[02:13:47.120 --> 02:13:50.840]  to orders the tyrants will gravitate to the positions Thomas Jefferson said the
[02:13:50.840 --> 02:13:55.240]  tyranny the level of tyranny will live under is the exact point he will put up
[02:13:55.240 --> 02:13:59.720]  with and and that's the bad prognosis doc as you know but I tell you you've
[02:13:59.720 --> 02:14:03.600]  been listening it's got to be 12 13 years has it not all come true like we
[02:14:03.600 --> 02:14:07.760]  said I mean it's it's we're just following the signpost right into hell
[02:14:07.760 --> 02:14:11.520]  here I mean it's it's we're getting pretty close to the mouth of the furnace
[02:14:11.520 --> 02:14:17.800]  now yeah like you I've known for a long time what was going on I just I'm old
[02:14:17.800 --> 02:14:21.120]  enough that I thought well it is you know this is something that the next
[02:14:21.120 --> 02:14:25.560]  generation is going to have to deal with and I I never dreamed that you know
[02:14:25.560 --> 02:14:30.600]  that fast approaching 60 years of age I'm going to have to I'm going to be the
[02:14:30.600 --> 02:14:35.880]  one has to deal with it look out because my IRS source said 70 plus percent of
[02:14:35.880 --> 02:14:39.320]  the audits and seizures are doing they've been told target retirees and
[02:14:39.320 --> 02:14:44.600]  they've changed the laws retroactively to now try to get your money and say oh
[02:14:44.600 --> 02:14:48.960]  you took 200,000 out the last couple years out of your retirement there's
[02:14:48.960 --> 02:14:52.520]  penalties interest you owe us a million and it's not even a law it's just total
[02:14:52.520 --> 02:14:55.520]  criminality good to hear from me any other comments on that I'm good there
[02:14:55.520 --> 02:14:59.280]  amazing info let's talk to Nathan in Minnesota you're on the air with our
[02:14:59.280 --> 02:15:04.280]  guest there thanks for having me on I'm actually a friend of Dan fights who's
[02:15:04.280 --> 02:15:08.680]  been on your show before yeah good guy I'm an attorney here in Minnesota and I
[02:15:08.680 --> 02:15:12.840]  I practiced in the area of bankruptcy and then I studied this issue I've had
[02:15:12.840 --> 02:15:17.160]  something some knowledge and exposure to this just a couple things I wanted to
[02:15:17.160 --> 02:15:21.040]  say in Minnesota that MERS has come and lobbied our legislature and just gotten
[02:15:21.040 --> 02:15:24.800]  a MERS statute that just says everything they don't have done is okay and they
[02:15:24.800 --> 02:15:28.320]  also got a favorable decision on a certified question from the federal
[02:15:28.320 --> 02:15:31.200]  court to the Minnesota Supreme Court in the case of Jackson v. MERS that
[02:15:31.200 --> 02:15:35.080]  basically says yeah everything they do is fine you can sever the note from the
[02:15:35.080 --> 02:15:39.680]  lien that said I think people should be really careful about you know what
[02:15:39.680 --> 02:15:42.720]  attorneys they hire we just had one here that got sanctioned for a lot of money
[02:15:42.720 --> 02:15:45.600]  and who is representing the people that he was going to be able to take care of
[02:15:45.600 --> 02:15:49.080]  these things so be real careful and check into who you hire and then the
[02:15:49.080 --> 02:15:52.440]  other thing I wanted to say that has to go with the IRS you see the IRS picking
[02:15:52.440 --> 02:15:56.000]  on little people all the time when these things were securitized and they put
[02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.840]  them in like these remic trusts I've learned this I've got a continuing
[02:15:58.840 --> 02:16:01.720]  legal education on this from real legitimate attorneys that have been
[02:16:01.720 --> 02:16:06.040]  involved in this a lot of people from the south they put them in these remic
[02:16:06.040 --> 02:16:09.080]  trust it's my understanding from these attorneys that the nature of these
[02:16:09.080 --> 02:16:12.240]  trusts is such that you're not supposed to transfer these assets around once
[02:16:12.240 --> 02:16:15.960]  you've got them in these trusts so essentially it appears to be that
[02:16:15.960 --> 02:16:20.960]  there's massive tax fraud that has been perpetrated by these banks and maybe
[02:16:20.960 --> 02:16:24.600]  Goldman Sachs or whoever's been churning these things out I actually got to
[02:16:24.600 --> 02:16:28.800]  talk to a retired partner in Goldman Sachs at a bar kind of friend of an
[02:16:28.800 --> 02:16:32.520]  uncle who basically he designed these things and he basically acknowledged to
[02:16:32.520 --> 02:16:35.680]  me off the record it's just a big fraud that they would have them that they
[02:16:35.680 --> 02:16:40.880]  would have them certified AAA and you know spin them off and so I think that
[02:16:40.880 --> 02:16:43.600]  there's massive you see our little you know our doctors you know that's not
[02:16:43.600 --> 02:16:46.480]  for middle-class person but I see people truck drivers and stuff picked up by the
[02:16:46.480 --> 02:16:51.320]  IRS oh no no no they admit they go after little people for no reason because
[02:16:51.320 --> 02:16:55.480]  they can't defend themselves I mean it is it is not only is the IRS robbing
[02:16:55.480 --> 02:16:59.320]  people folks you're robbing innocent people and destroying families you're
[02:16:59.320 --> 02:17:03.360]  you're mojo whatever you want to call it you're karma you're reap what you so I
[02:17:03.360 --> 02:17:07.160]  wouldn't want to be you and I'm not talking about people doing something to
[02:17:07.160 --> 02:17:11.320]  you I'm not God I mean I've learned one thing folks you do wrong it comes back
[02:17:11.320 --> 02:17:15.880]  on you many fold I notice a day that you're sitting there pretty excited to
[02:17:15.880 --> 02:17:18.960]  say something you know about these cases thank you for the call sir I have one
[02:17:18.960 --> 02:17:21.760]  question I'll stay there stay there yeah I have one question I want to ask
[02:17:21.760 --> 02:17:24.760]  Nathan if you're still in the already dropped sorry that yeah I'm trying to
[02:17:24.760 --> 02:17:28.040]  find out how much luck these bankruptcies attorneys are having doing
[02:17:28.040 --> 02:17:31.840]  adversarial proceedings inside of chapter 13 because a lot of people they
[02:17:31.840 --> 02:17:35.360]  try to do a chapter 7 bankruptcy and you basically are just discharging and
[02:17:35.360 --> 02:17:37.840]  dumping all the debt but you were sure you were nodding you're having talked
[02:17:37.840 --> 02:17:41.200]  about a lawyer getting sanctioned in Minnesota that was a massive case and
[02:17:41.200 --> 02:17:44.160]  he's still getting sanctioned he basically was doing a lot of blanket
[02:17:44.160 --> 02:17:48.280]  filing of the same type of lawsuits trying to stop these foreclosures and
[02:17:48.280 --> 02:17:52.360]  the courts basically just hammered him unfortunately the problem in the Minnesota
[02:17:52.360 --> 02:17:56.440]  and this is you know there are several states that are really seriously in
[02:17:56.440 --> 02:18:00.960]  trouble Michigan is one Minnesota's one they've given MERS a lot of latitude
[02:18:00.960 --> 02:18:05.320]  Arizona with the Cervantes case and the multi-district litigation has given
[02:18:05.320 --> 02:18:10.360]  MERS a huge for the courts are backing the fraud a lot of what we're seeing is
[02:18:10.360 --> 02:18:14.720]  that the courts are siding with MERS in that they and this is part of the problem
[02:18:14.720 --> 02:18:19.000]  is the borrower the borrower went in ignorantly and signed his name to Adida
[02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:23.160]  trust your mortgage and gave MERS but a fraudulent I know lawyer but I know it
[02:18:23.160 --> 02:18:29.880]  and all law ancient and and then more newer forms of a something designed to
[02:18:29.880 --> 02:18:35.280]  deceive and to be a fraud is a null and void contract if it can be proven that
[02:18:35.280 --> 02:18:38.480]  the thing I have to ask the borrower when they go to the closing table like
[02:18:38.480 --> 02:18:41.200]  yourself when you went out and got a mortgage loan did you read before you
[02:18:41.200 --> 02:18:46.080]  signed yes but it's written in legalese you know basically in a foreign
[02:18:46.080 --> 02:18:48.920]  language I understand did they tell you that you could get an attorney at the
[02:18:48.920 --> 02:18:52.440]  time that you signed this document yeah see the thing is is that Americans
[02:18:52.440 --> 02:18:56.400]  because of this lack of financial education I was referring to earlier in
[02:18:56.400 --> 02:19:00.600]  the show because of the fact that they know we've been raised we've been raised
[02:19:00.600 --> 02:19:05.240]  to be victims and to be cattle that that's why the big banking associations a
[02:19:05.240 --> 02:19:08.440]  hundred years ago or more said we've got to finance the dumbing down yeah well
[02:19:08.440 --> 02:19:11.640]  you have to look at it when you go into sign a mortgage loan if anything if you
[02:19:11.640 --> 02:19:15.240]  know somebody that's going to be buying a house at any point in time in the near
[02:19:15.240 --> 02:19:18.360]  future you need to sit down if you know about this book and you need to share it
[02:19:18.360 --> 02:19:22.920]  with them and tell them look if you go in and you see an 18 digit min number it
[02:19:22.920 --> 02:19:27.000]  means that they intended to securitize your loan that min number was on your
[02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:31.120]  document before you went to closing they already had that note and that pool and
[02:19:31.120 --> 02:19:34.880]  everything they already get it agreed to get you the loan now now to and they
[02:19:34.880 --> 02:19:38.880]  shopping around that's how they get it but to expand on that you're saying more
[02:19:38.880 --> 02:19:42.080]  and more you go to title companies those themselves you can do an original old
[02:19:42.080 --> 02:19:45.600]  fashion system you just got to ask for it right there are good banks out there
[02:19:45.600 --> 02:19:50.040]  that will hold the paper and that's the way it used to be so and the book breaks

[02:24:19.720 --> 02:24:24.880]  let's go to Sandy in Florida you're on the air with the author of clouded
[02:24:24.880 --> 02:24:29.680]  titles dame Krieger go ahead hello how are you I'm good man do you have a
[02:24:29.680 --> 02:24:34.440]  question or comment kind of a question and a comment well actually I was
[02:24:34.440 --> 02:24:37.600]  helping a friend of mine who's been facing foreclosure she's been fighting
[02:24:37.600 --> 02:24:41.440]  successfully through an attorney but then they dropped her because the banks
[02:24:41.440 --> 02:24:46.040]  want to do a modification and she didn't so we went pro se because we couldn't
[02:24:46.040 --> 02:24:49.160]  find any attorneys to help us one actually said you know what happens when
[02:24:49.160 --> 02:24:54.360]  people come against the system they get killed so we went and we showed the judge
[02:24:54.360 --> 02:24:59.360]  that the assignment of mortgage was done two months after they had already first
[02:24:59.360 --> 02:25:03.920]  file for foreclosure so when she talked to the attorney the attorney said oh
[02:25:03.920 --> 02:25:08.560]  that we took care of that before and she said no there's nothing in here about
[02:25:08.560 --> 02:25:12.040]  that and then she said you have the original he said no finally she looked
[02:25:12.040 --> 02:25:15.680]  at him she goes you got a serious problem here and she says but I'm not
[02:25:15.680 --> 02:25:19.160]  dismissing the case and she looked at my friends because I'm not going to give
[02:25:19.160 --> 02:25:24.120]  you a place for free so they you know they stopped it they didn't give them the
[02:25:24.120 --> 02:25:30.040]  summary judgment so listening to you I've written down some notes we did she
[02:25:30.040 --> 02:25:34.360]  did get an attorney because when I said to my friend said to the judge we feel
[02:25:34.360 --> 02:25:37.800]  there's fraud involved in the actual sure we're not gonna be able to break down
[02:25:37.800 --> 02:25:41.280]  the whole case here today ma'am or give you you know things that are gonna win
[02:25:41.280 --> 02:25:44.680]  you need to get the book or do further research but did you have a question for
[02:25:44.680 --> 02:25:48.920]  our guest well yeah the question is that they want to do mediation there is a
[02:25:48.920 --> 02:25:53.440]  there should we bring up there's both have a title expert so if he's there
[02:25:53.440 --> 02:25:57.640]  should we bring up the whole thing about what you were mentioning about the ma'am
[02:25:57.640 --> 02:26:00.880]  we can't sit here and give you advice over the air and other particulars but
[02:26:00.880 --> 02:26:04.600]  I appreciate your call but I'm sure you hear this all day Dave I do a lot and
[02:26:04.600 --> 02:26:09.360]  you know basically the way things are if I was in that position Alex I would be
[02:26:09.360 --> 02:26:13.560]  you know looking at the attorney and I'd be saying okay you know what's wrong
[02:26:13.560 --> 02:26:17.520]  with the logistics here and why aren't we arguing these things I mean he needs
[02:26:17.520 --> 02:26:21.080]  to speak up you know my biggest concern because she was sitting there talking
[02:26:21.080 --> 02:26:24.920]  about a loan mod if you've got a document that or an assignment that is
[02:26:24.920 --> 02:26:29.200]  questionable and you know it's questionable then you know the question
[02:26:29.200 --> 02:26:33.200]  then becomes or the issue becomes why am I negotiating and doing a loan mod with
[02:26:33.200 --> 02:26:37.080]  a lender that may not own my note this is this but that shows you've already
[02:26:37.080 --> 02:26:40.200]  gotten pretty far that now they're trying to you well so the problem with
[02:26:40.200 --> 02:26:43.880]  with loan mods is it drives the borrower because it takes a long time to get a
[02:26:43.880 --> 02:26:46.960]  loan mod done and the whole time that this is happening the borrowers either
[02:26:46.960 --> 02:26:51.200]  making trial payments or not making payments at all and and they're getting
[02:26:51.200 --> 02:26:54.120]  deeper in debt and there's more servicing fees being added on by the
[02:26:54.120 --> 02:26:58.560]  servicer and so as an end result it costs more to dig out of the of the snow
[02:26:58.560 --> 02:27:02.600]  drip you know once everything is all piled up around you so you know this is
[02:27:02.600 --> 02:27:06.600]  why we go back to the core and look at chain of title versus chain of custody
[02:27:06.600 --> 02:27:09.780]  the note exactly they're trying to change the subject let's go to Bob and
[02:27:09.780 --> 02:27:16.920]  Florida Bob you're on the air hi how you doing good listen it's funny that you
[02:27:16.920 --> 02:27:21.840]  guys are bringing this up today I had a prop piece of property that was sold
[02:27:21.840 --> 02:27:28.640]  yesterday and I got a phone call from the title company and here the notary at
[02:27:28.640 --> 02:27:33.480]  the county level never had a witness when she notarized it now she's a county
[02:27:33.480 --> 02:27:39.640]  employee never had it witnessed and here the title company will now or will not
[02:27:39.640 --> 02:27:45.400]  allow the sale to go through and I was told I have to go get an attorney well
[02:27:45.400 --> 02:27:48.160]  that's one of the good things now they're starting to make them not do all
[02:27:48.160 --> 02:27:51.840]  the robot behavior go ahead no that that's a that's a valid argument and a
[02:27:51.840 --> 02:27:55.240]  valid reason to go get counseled because of the fact that you know somebody
[02:27:55.240 --> 02:28:00.720]  might be subtly sending you a message that you might have an out here you
[02:28:00.720 --> 02:28:04.680]  might be able to vacate the entire judgment and sale because of the fact of
[02:28:04.680 --> 02:28:07.280]  the way the case was done and that's you know when you're seeing any little
[02:28:07.280 --> 02:28:10.840]  thing that's wrong including not having a notary witness or any number of little
[02:28:10.840 --> 02:28:14.600]  factors that creep into this yeah what's happening is you've got moral people
[02:28:14.600 --> 02:28:19.920]  who thought that the IRS and other places were legitimate now they're
[02:28:19.920 --> 02:28:23.200]  finding out it's all a fraud and people at the county level they're not allowed
[02:28:23.200 --> 02:28:26.040]  to come out and speak out against it because of the tyranny but they will
[02:28:26.040 --> 02:28:30.320]  sit there and give you tips they will you know to explain things to you well
[02:28:30.320 --> 02:28:33.760]  they drop they can't give legal advice either Alex but they can drop subtle
[02:28:33.760 --> 02:28:37.600]  hints and that's apparently what this gentleman has happened to him and so if
[02:28:37.600 --> 02:28:41.080]  somebody says I really think you need to get an attorney because I see a problem
[02:28:41.080 --> 02:28:45.000]  here you know they're basically speaking off the cuff to you but what they're
[02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:48.840]  doing is they're dropping a subtle hint that you may have a case and you know
[02:28:48.840 --> 02:28:52.120]  you always have to entertain that you can't you know for you to sit there and
[02:28:52.120 --> 02:28:56.400]  do nothing diminishes your chances exponentially and the more of it and the
[02:28:56.400 --> 02:28:59.840]  more of us fight them just by sheer numbers it's gonna it's gonna drive this
[02:28:59.840 --> 02:29:04.960]  out in the open great call sir does that answer your question yeah the only
[02:29:04.960 --> 02:29:10.000]  other question is do you have any recourse because now I have to get an
[02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:15.640]  attorney to deal with something that the county was supposed to do okay real
[02:29:15.640 --> 02:29:19.480]  fast we're almost out of time sure sure you'll find out more in the book

[02:32:58.400 --> 02:33:16.440]  I was sitting in traffic listening to the radio
[02:33:16.440 --> 02:33:24.160]  George straight was singing seashores of old Mexico
[02:33:24.160 --> 02:33:31.480]  it sounded so good I got an idea I'm gonna go there since they're all over
[02:33:31.480 --> 02:33:38.800]  here long-star state should be renamed Texaco
[02:33:38.800 --> 02:33:55.440]  long Texas hello Mexico I'm gonna swim the Rio Grande at El Paso I'm leaving
[02:33:55.440 --> 02:34:03.040]  tonight I ain't gonna pack I'm only taking the clothes on my back so long
[02:34:03.040 --> 02:34:24.480]  Texas hello Mexico I'll drive a rattle-trap car with no liability all
[02:34:24.480 --> 02:34:33.600]  the man he writes though I'm there illegally I'll protest in the streets
[02:34:33.600 --> 02:34:39.920]  till they finally grant them sing English words to their national anthem hey
[02:34:39.920 --> 02:34:46.440]  then said they watch right for your people should be right for me
[02:34:46.440 --> 02:34:55.640]  there's no control in that tie that keeps rolling across the line this old Texas
[02:34:55.640 --> 02:35:08.560]  cowboy feels like my home states no longer mine so long Texas hello Mexico
[02:35:08.560 --> 02:35:15.680]  I'm gonna swim the Rio Grande at El Paso yeah you know why we played this song
[02:35:15.680 --> 02:35:21.640]  today because I remember an associated press article seven eight years ago
[02:35:21.640 --> 02:35:26.320]  saying banks do favors for illegal immigrants and it had different bank
[02:35:26.320 --> 02:35:30.520]  heads saying oh yeah you don't have to have ID if you're an illegal we'll just
[02:35:30.520 --> 02:35:34.440]  give you a home loan whatever else but citizens you have to show four or five
[02:35:34.440 --> 02:35:39.520]  forms of ID and now the federal government issues illegals fake tax ID
[02:35:39.520 --> 02:35:43.320]  numbers the states accept their driver's license not because they care
[02:35:43.320 --> 02:35:47.040]  about these people but because they want to drive down wages and they want to
[02:35:47.040 --> 02:35:51.440]  play us off against each other and they want to make everybody poor that's how
[02:35:51.440 --> 02:35:56.240]  economies work when you bring in giant unskilled massive workforces it drags
[02:35:56.240 --> 02:36:03.600]  down the base wage and I this good you know this all gets into basic economic
[02:36:03.600 --> 02:36:11.600]  theorem but the point is the system knows exactly what it is doing and then
[02:36:11.600 --> 02:36:15.920]  the citizens get the book thrown at them because being a citizen I mean I
[02:36:15.920 --> 02:36:20.120]  thought about before of course I would be prosecuted because I'm seen as a mark
[02:36:20.120 --> 02:36:23.400]  because I'm an American if you're Hispanic black white agent if you're a
[02:36:23.400 --> 02:36:28.320]  citizen you're seen as a chump so if I announce that my name was Juan Gonzalez
[02:36:28.320 --> 02:36:35.760]  and started just drunk driving and I wouldn't get a $10 fine I'd get you know
[02:36:35.760 --> 02:36:39.800]  they'd find out who I was and I put me through the system good but I've talked
[02:36:39.800 --> 02:36:43.400]  to assisted prosecutors here in Austin they've come to my office with their
[02:36:43.400 --> 02:36:46.960]  business cards I've seen them on TV and said well I can't come on air but here's
[02:36:46.960 --> 02:36:49.920]  the places to look promise I'm so overwhelmed I don't I can't have time
[02:36:49.920 --> 02:36:53.240]  to get into all this most of the time and they were going yeah what you talk
[02:36:53.240 --> 02:36:57.600]  about 10 20 $30 fines for drunk driving you name it when the police arrest them
[02:36:57.600 --> 02:37:04.120]  I've had cops tell me this one night one of my IT guys driver's license was
[02:37:04.120 --> 02:37:07.640]  expired I pulled up at the office like eight o'clock at night I've told the
[02:37:07.640 --> 02:37:14.960]  story 20 30 times and I see one of my T guys will contractor in handcuffs and he
[02:37:14.960 --> 02:37:18.840]  turned into the office they thought that was suspicious they came over ran
[02:37:18.840 --> 02:37:22.080]  stuff is his license was expired I said can't you just give them a ticket for
[02:37:22.080 --> 02:37:26.360]  that can't you just and they're like well we're encouraged sometimes it was
[02:37:26.360 --> 02:37:29.480]  still suspicious and by the way we went in your building we thought it was
[02:37:29.480 --> 02:37:32.960]  suspicious he went in the building and I was like you thought it was suspicious
[02:37:32.960 --> 02:37:36.280]  he went in the building because oh yeah it was excuse to go there cops ran around
[02:37:36.280 --> 02:37:38.880]  inside my office they thought he was suspicious yeah he looks real
[02:37:38.880 --> 02:37:43.760]  suspicious wearing a button-up clean shirt you know six foot six foot two
[02:37:43.760 --> 02:37:49.880]  looks like a Sunday school teacher he looks really evil and I forgot that
[02:37:49.880 --> 02:37:53.760]  part so so the handcuff team the door was left open so they ran around inside
[02:37:53.760 --> 02:37:56.840]  the office they thought he ran in the was running away he pulled him right off
[02:37:56.840 --> 02:38:01.640]  the road came in cops pull up he calls me goes there's all these cops out here
[02:38:01.640 --> 02:38:05.320]  what do I do I said well I guess go talk to him he comes out they put him in
[02:38:05.320 --> 02:38:10.240]  handcuffs go in the building and I was asking him the cops and the police officer
[02:38:10.240 --> 02:38:13.920]  you know the head guys like oh Alex Jones were listeners and I'm sitting there
[02:38:13.920 --> 02:38:18.360]  were like four cops I'm going okay a couple were leaving so it was four but
[02:38:18.360 --> 02:38:23.280]  others had already left oh yeah I like your show I'm in a rock and roll band I
[02:38:23.280 --> 02:38:26.440]  retire in six months boy the cops are rude in New York I was up there and asked
[02:38:26.440 --> 02:38:30.840]  for directions they got my face yeah hey we're taking your guy to jail I was
[02:38:30.840 --> 02:38:34.440]  like why she goes well she was the first to be here and so that's what she wants
[02:38:34.440 --> 02:38:38.720]  to do I guess he didn't look like he enjoyed having you know having him come
[02:38:38.720 --> 02:38:42.800]  to the door and stuff so and I went and I said but if he was any legal you let him
[02:38:42.800 --> 02:38:47.280]  go and he goes yeah probably even if he was drunk driving because the judges you
[02:38:47.280 --> 02:38:50.040]  know they just let him go and it's kind of frowned upon for us to even arrest him
[02:38:50.040 --> 02:38:54.120]  and all the cops are sitting there nodding their head and I'm trying to talk to
[02:38:54.120 --> 02:38:58.200]  the woman cop and I'm like come on let him go it'd be reasonable and she she
[02:38:58.200 --> 02:39:02.880]  looked mad she wouldn't talk to me so I just said oh that's great she drives off
[02:39:02.880 --> 02:39:05.880]  with him and the other cops are like hey I like this on the show and it was like
[02:39:05.880 --> 02:39:09.880]  it didn't it was like they were being friendly and nice and were listeners but
[02:39:09.880 --> 02:39:15.000]  we're so used to selectively enforcing and abusing citizens that it didn't even
[02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:21.320]  connect with them what they were doing it didn't even connect with them what
[02:39:21.320 --> 02:39:28.280]  they were doing the the illegal aliens in most states you can look this up get
[02:39:28.280 --> 02:39:33.660]  better in-state tuition than people that even live in the state they get their
[02:39:33.660 --> 02:39:38.520]  babies paid for and they have babies everything and again it's wrong it's
[02:39:38.520 --> 02:39:41.760]  wrong you can't go to Mexico and be treated like that you can't be an
[02:39:41.760 --> 02:39:45.640]  illegal alien in China be treated like that folks you know what they do to an
[02:39:45.640 --> 02:39:49.720]  illegal alien in Mexico look it up if you can pull up headlines Mexico most
[02:39:49.720 --> 02:39:52.880]  abusive to immigrants illegal immigrants in fact type it in guys New York
[02:39:52.880 --> 02:39:59.640]  Times you name it they put you in a hard labor work camp with mosquito snakes you
[02:39:59.640 --> 02:40:03.920]  name it with big fences around it busting rocks for gravel the old-fashioned
[02:40:03.920 --> 02:40:09.840]  deal for one year and do you know what happens while you're in the slave camp
[02:40:09.840 --> 02:40:15.640]  they run your ID and extort your family because if you don't send the money they
[02:40:15.640 --> 02:40:22.800]  will let you starve and will kill you Mexico runs real-life concentration
[02:40:22.800 --> 02:40:26.720]  camps in fact I saw a number of thousands of Guatemalans a year that
[02:40:26.720 --> 02:40:32.120]  try to get into Mexico to get to the US end up dying in the slave camps like I'll
[02:40:32.120 --> 02:40:48.680]  type it in watch this Mexico Mexico abuses illegal immigrants there's WSBT
[02:40:48.680 --> 02:40:53.760]  Mexico officials accused of abusing illegal immigrants hypocrisy Mexico's
[02:40:53.760 --> 02:40:57.760]  immigration stance reporter Ludge's board and just goes on there's a bunch of
[02:40:57.760 --> 02:41:03.600]  them you could find it legal immigrants really are abused in Mexico and I mean
[02:41:03.600 --> 02:41:08.320]  yeah let me tell you folks you talk about hellish but but my whole point is
[02:41:08.320 --> 02:41:13.000]  can I come to Mexico and just get on a bunch of welfare and have one house in
[02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:16.480]  Austin because my whistleblower was saying it was 500,000 or something a
[02:41:16.480 --> 02:41:25.880]  year it was 89 million to 10 houses in Austin just where I live 89 million we
[02:41:25.880 --> 02:41:34.520]  showed you that out of accounting business times yesterday okay now for our
[02:41:34.520 --> 02:41:43.480]  top story here today this happened when I was driving to work and it was about
[02:41:43.480 --> 02:41:48.360]  10 a.m. and I'm driving down 290 and I could tell they must have a checkpoint
[02:41:48.360 --> 02:41:52.800]  up ahead or a wreck they like to do checkpoints at the Y for the commercial
[02:41:52.800 --> 02:41:58.360]  vehicles the trucks but they shut down the road a lot so I have to leave you
[02:41:58.360 --> 02:42:02.400]  know really early now used to take me 30 minutes to get to work now can take
[02:42:02.400 --> 02:42:05.920]  over an hour because of the the checkpoints and the Austin police are
[02:42:05.920 --> 02:42:11.840]  now wearing Marine Corps drill sergeant hats I hadn't seen that yet and they were
[02:42:11.840 --> 02:42:16.440]  out there but so I'm seeing pretty pretty heavy traffic and I'm dreading it
[02:42:16.440 --> 02:42:20.400]  going man I left you know an hour and 20 minutes before the show I get ready at
[02:42:20.400 --> 02:42:25.040]  home I thought man I've got to find another route to work through through
[02:42:25.040 --> 02:42:29.400]  the checkpoint because they it's not a major highway they just they just do it
[02:42:29.400 --> 02:42:31.920]  where these roads come together in the in just in the middle of the worst
[02:42:31.920 --> 02:42:37.600]  snorrel in Austin the Y so I'm sitting there and I look up and I go is that a
[02:42:37.600 --> 02:42:43.080]  bird is that a plane no that's a drone and right over the highway at about 125
[02:42:43.080 --> 02:42:50.480]  150 feet or so is a drone moving back and forth and I look over and I see what
[02:42:50.480 --> 02:42:55.160]  looks like a Texas Department of Transportation truck I see a guy with a
[02:42:55.160 --> 02:43:01.400]  hard hat sitting there running it and I pull off and we're you're about to see
[02:43:01.400 --> 02:43:06.800]  that video and I get out and talk to the guy and they're doing for about 20
[02:43:06.800 --> 02:43:09.280]  minutes we'll probably air most interview on the nightly news tonight but
[02:43:09.280 --> 02:43:12.200]  this is some excerpts of it or we have some of the better audio because I
[02:43:12.200 --> 02:43:19.520]  shut it on an iPhone a lot of us not that good for radio and you know the guy
[02:43:19.520 --> 02:43:22.760]  knew who I was and then listeners started stopping and honking and getting
[02:43:22.760 --> 02:43:26.240]  out taking photos and then he was like hey it's not bad that I have a drone I'm
[02:43:26.240 --> 02:43:30.800]  like look it's okay for maps of the highway you know with your video slash
[02:43:30.800 --> 02:43:35.000]  steel camera flying around but I said no but we're asking about weaponized
[02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:39.520]  drones he said oh that's a conspiracy and he was a really nice guy but we've
[02:43:39.520 --> 02:43:45.280]  put together the video with articles for him and he said there's like four or
[02:43:45.280 --> 02:43:51.480]  five of these just with their company operating in Austin but you know I
[02:43:51.480 --> 02:43:54.680]  thought we might even hire the guy for the shooting show sometime to come out
[02:43:54.680 --> 02:43:59.320]  and show us when we're shooting with the drone it's a camera wings low-level
[02:43:59.320 --> 02:44:05.360]  aerial video photography Robert Jones I believe I pronounce it owner and flight
[02:44:05.360 --> 02:44:09.800]  operations officer and he's got four people working for him that also do it and
[02:44:09.800 --> 02:44:14.160]  he was flying over the highway for a text dot text dot deal but my point was
[02:44:14.160 --> 02:44:17.240]  when I got out and said oh this is interesting by the way I don't want
[02:44:17.240 --> 02:44:20.400]  weaponized ones he was like that's not happening even though we have articles
[02:44:20.400 --> 02:44:23.760]  here in Texas where there where the cops are trying to get authorization from the
[02:44:23.760 --> 02:44:27.960]  FAA to put shotguns and tear gas on them that's in CBS news that's in Houston
[02:44:27.960 --> 02:44:31.120]  Chronicle so we're going to show you some of those articles over the video your
[02:44:31.120 --> 02:44:34.400]  radio listener we're gonna air this on the nightly news tonight and we'll also
[02:44:34.400 --> 02:44:38.400]  have it posted by the night of tomorrow on YouTube maybe even quicker I think
[02:44:38.400 --> 02:44:41.520]  curtain almost got an article this afternoon for info wars.com so if you
[02:44:41.520 --> 02:44:44.720]  hear this in rebroadcast later go to info wars.com you can watch the video
[02:44:44.720 --> 02:44:51.000]  there on the site Alex Jones you know buzzed by drone Alex Jones catches
[02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:55.000]  highway department drone in action you know something like that here it is but
[02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:58.600]  I you know I mean he was kind of like and I'm like hey buddy it's news gathering
[02:44:58.600 --> 02:45:02.400]  we're out here on the street I'm gonna air this so he got a little bit nicer and
[02:45:02.400 --> 02:45:06.440]  we've cut out some of our arguments I may air some of those later but but you know
[02:45:06.440 --> 02:45:09.840]  the point is is he's a llama patriot well you know I know what's going on well I
[02:45:09.840 --> 02:45:13.560]  mean I know they're trying to you know do this and that but and but but but still
[02:45:13.560 --> 02:45:17.200]  my drone's okay this is why in a site and I'm like yeah I understand your
[02:45:17.200 --> 02:45:23.440]  drone's not bad but Janet DePolitano is announcing that they're gonna use them
[02:45:23.440 --> 02:45:27.000]  for quote public safety in the police and now they're arming them so we're
[02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:31.600]  having a debate about this and you need to have the drone industry the subgroups
[02:45:31.600 --> 02:45:37.720]  point out they're not with the weaponized angle I mean I went and saw total
[02:45:37.720 --> 02:45:41.360]  recall last night I think I'm gonna shoot a review for the nightly news tonight
[02:45:41.360 --> 02:45:44.760]  I meant to see this is written on Alamo draft house order slips you can order
[02:45:44.760 --> 02:45:49.720]  food there wrote these in the dark so it's hard to read but it was an amazing
[02:45:49.720 --> 02:45:53.560]  film I went saw total recall the government stages terror attacks in it to
[02:45:53.560 --> 02:45:56.880]  take the liberties there's underground bases everybody else lives on the
[02:45:56.880 --> 02:45:59.800]  surface because the government's released a chemical weapon previously to take
[02:45:59.800 --> 02:46:03.480]  over a global corporation runs things there's two global corporations that
[02:46:03.480 --> 02:46:08.680]  fight with each other Britain is the command center of it all I'll do my
[02:46:08.680 --> 02:46:18.840]  review tonight let's go ahead and get to this piece Alex Jones you're truly
[02:46:18.840 --> 02:46:24.600]  running smack dab into a pretty sophisticated little drone and then of
[02:46:24.600 --> 02:46:27.760]  course the checkpoint on down the road with cops bugger their eyes out at me
[02:46:27.760 --> 02:46:31.280]  when I rolled by through the traffic slow wearing their drill sergeant hats I
[02:46:31.280 --> 02:46:36.640]  didn't know I ever joined the Marine Corps but I'm a milk cow milk me milk me
[02:46:36.640 --> 02:46:43.200]  but again I shouldn't be upset about the about the drones it's it's a good
[02:46:43.200 --> 02:46:50.080]  thing and the TSA to their their good people again we have to recognize that
[02:46:50.080 --> 02:46:55.360]  this is out of control but here is the proliferation so many drones that now
[02:46:55.360 --> 02:46:59.200]  you can't even mess them here it is folks Alex Jones here I was driving to
[02:46:59.200 --> 02:47:14.040]  work and saw the drone hey how's it going
[02:47:14.040 --> 02:47:26.480]  driving to work here saw this flying over the road I had Joe Farrah asking
[02:47:26.480 --> 02:47:32.720]  if I'd ever seen one run by government I had there it is I'm shooting this with
[02:47:32.720 --> 02:47:52.440]  my phone out here footage of the drone coming in for a landing pretty pretty
[02:47:52.440 --> 02:48:08.320]  darn powerful footage man that iPhone really did a great job
[02:48:08.320 --> 02:48:20.920]  wow what's that oh highway department proliferation of drones huh yeah have
[02:48:20.920 --> 02:48:26.240]  you seen our video drones shot down over Texas pretty good check it out I know
[02:48:26.240 --> 02:48:30.960]  that there was a situation over in Mississippi or Alabama where they some
[02:48:30.960 --> 02:48:35.160]  guys were over flying a pigeon shoot like pita people oh yeah and it got shot
[02:48:35.160 --> 02:48:42.600]  down yeah no no that was great that was the first drone shootdown but we did one
[02:48:42.600 --> 02:49:03.320]  with our gun show just to simulate it what is that to look at the toll roads
[02:49:03.320 --> 02:49:26.160]  Wow what do you think about in the news that Texas is weaponizing drones to
[02:49:26.160 --> 02:49:35.120]  have them flying around with shotguns and riot control check it out it just
[02:49:35.120 --> 02:49:38.200]  sort of happened in the last month yeah did you hear about them using a
[02:49:38.200 --> 02:49:44.080]  predator drone against people that had a cattle dispute in North Dakota didn't
[02:49:44.080 --> 02:49:47.760]  surprise me that they may have gone over taking pictures do you think it's good
[02:49:47.760 --> 02:50:00.800]  to have the Department of Defense operating in domestically but you know
[02:50:00.800 --> 02:50:05.360]  these could shoot over fences though privacy fences well but I mean every
[02:50:05.360 --> 02:50:13.320]  day Google is flying over the chairs and my swimming pool now I know but Google
[02:50:13.320 --> 02:50:20.240]  also got caught using those little cars to grab people's passcodes so you can
[02:50:20.240 --> 02:50:24.800]  program this to kind of fly itself but then you can just override it well you
[02:50:24.800 --> 02:50:28.880]  know as you see it set up right now it doesn't have autonomous flight
[02:50:28.880 --> 02:50:34.560]  capabilities other than if it runs low on battery it will automatically return
[02:50:34.560 --> 02:50:40.240]  before it gets in trouble so there's an override right and it also has a if the
[02:50:40.240 --> 02:50:56.240]  radio or some reason to break and this camera shoots video and stills yes I've
[02:50:56.240 --> 02:51:01.240]  got two of those cameras they're awesome they've got high-def quality that just
[02:51:01.240 --> 02:51:14.720]  ten years ago that would have cost 60 grand a whole bunch of them
[02:51:14.720 --> 02:51:19.680]  we had to and I think they're pushing for five right now the Air Force what
[02:51:19.680 --> 02:51:35.600]  has over 15,000 of them and they're using them all over the world well actually
[02:51:35.600 --> 02:51:42.800]  I mean we got footage in Florida where they are I mean they say police are
[02:51:42.800 --> 02:51:49.840]  fully autonomous drones where they can send them out to a spot and you know
[02:51:49.840 --> 02:51:54.920]  that's a different thing the guy isn't seeing but he's got a sure pre-programmed
[02:51:54.920 --> 02:51:59.280]  or he's flying it by camera where he's looking into an image and flying it
[02:51:59.280 --> 02:52:04.720]  first person view but you know the guys that are flying low-level under
[02:52:04.720 --> 02:52:13.160]  regulated airspace you know I'm flying 400 feet or less regulated airspace sure
[02:52:13.160 --> 02:52:16.000]  listen you're out here getting shots from the highway department that's
[02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:19.920]  that's understandable what that's a great profession really neat I'm glad we
[02:52:19.920 --> 02:52:24.000]  ran each other I'm talking about police departments are saying we're getting them
[02:52:24.000 --> 02:52:30.480]  and we're we want to weaponize them well see I actually know
[02:52:30.480 --> 02:52:34.480]  what I would like to do is yeah before they serve a warrant is fly around the
[02:52:34.480 --> 02:52:39.520]  house and look at exits and stuff like that you know things like couldn't
[02:52:39.520 --> 02:52:44.640]  Google Earth do that well yeah if you could get them to fly out well that's
[02:52:44.640 --> 02:52:47.760]  the thing though yeah Google looks straight down these can come in and look
[02:52:47.760 --> 02:52:53.240]  yeah that's that's I'm telling you that's the big brother aspect look look at
[02:52:53.240 --> 02:52:55.720]  all the surveillance look at the NSA admitting it's fine on the American
[02:52:55.720 --> 02:52:59.440]  people illegally look at all the loss of liberty all the cameras I remember
[02:52:59.440 --> 02:53:02.880]  talking to the highway department 15 years ago and they said we'll never use
[02:53:02.880 --> 02:53:06.320]  these for the police and of course they were planning at the whole time it's a
[02:53:06.320 --> 02:53:19.280]  night but I mean who's watching the government yeah well he said a lot more
[02:53:19.280 --> 02:53:24.720]  as well there with us in the interview but that's cut down for time and he
[02:53:24.720 --> 02:53:28.680]  talked about a really expensive drone helicopter Texas the Texas department
[02:53:28.680 --> 02:53:32.640]  had that did just crash I think I'm gonna have Jacobson add that to the video
[02:53:32.640 --> 02:53:36.600]  before we post it up to info wars calm for everybody but if you're a radio
[02:53:36.600 --> 02:53:40.800]  listener it's pretty darn powerful footage I got where it's flying around
[02:53:40.800 --> 02:53:47.720]  above us on the highway and then coming down and landing and again because of
[02:53:47.720 --> 02:53:53.840]  computers because of production because of managerization this stuff's getting
[02:53:53.840 --> 02:53:57.280]  cheaper and cheaper it is being weaponized and that's basically what the
[02:53:57.280 --> 02:54:01.760]  whole total recall movie is about is where this global corporation wants to
[02:54:01.760 --> 02:54:07.840]  kill the rest of humanity so a tiny group can just have robots run everything
[02:54:07.840 --> 02:54:12.480]  humans aren't needed anymore and I brought up why the future doesn't need us
[02:54:12.480 --> 02:54:15.920]  to this guy and he was laughing we should probably add that and show the
[02:54:15.920 --> 02:54:19.000]  article where Bill Joyce said yeah I had meetings with the globalist you know
[02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:22.320]  they had a son micro system and they want to get rid everybody I mean that's
[02:54:22.320 --> 02:54:25.840]  the plan with all this there's not gonna be humans going to space there's not
[02:54:25.840 --> 02:54:29.160]  gonna be humans and submarines humans on ships humans and aircraft it's all
[02:54:29.160 --> 02:54:33.800]  gonna be robot and cheaper quicker faster all of it people worry about unions
[02:54:33.800 --> 02:54:37.960]  taking your job or vice versa non-union how about machines and it's not that I'm
[02:54:37.960 --> 02:54:41.680]  against technology it's that the globalist controlling it are building
[02:54:41.680 --> 02:54:45.680]  back doors into all of it and no one can deny this stuff is being used to
[02:54:45.680 --> 02:54:51.480]  attack us and people that are in these industries are immediately you know
[02:54:51.480 --> 02:54:55.280]  overly defensive because I didn't put a lot of the arguments and stuff in there
[02:54:55.280 --> 02:54:59.080]  I may put out a longer version where the guys like well say drones are bad
[02:54:59.080 --> 02:55:01.880]  they're not bad my drone's not bad it does a good job is cheaper than
[02:55:01.880 --> 02:55:05.440]  helicopters humans won't get hurt well yeah then there's that nanny state idea
[02:55:05.440 --> 02:55:08.240]  well if I have humans or helicopters because they might get hurt and he's
[02:55:08.240 --> 02:55:12.560]  not saying that but that's where this goes they've already got Google cars all
[02:55:12.560 --> 02:55:15.800]  over the United States they're saying oh they're already safer than humans we
[02:55:15.800 --> 02:55:20.120]  should get rid of humans this this is the globalist plan I know what I'm
[02:55:20.120 --> 02:55:26.040]  talking about we cover it all an in-game blueprint for global enslavement that
[02:55:26.040 --> 02:55:30.080]  they're trying to take off YouTube right now with some band claiming they own my
[02:55:30.080 --> 02:55:33.760]  voice now and by the way I nicely talked about this on there a few weeks ago
[02:55:33.760 --> 02:55:37.080]  and they haven't taken the attempted block off yet I'm gonna have to take
[02:55:37.080 --> 02:55:40.840]  action very soon somebody needs to get a hold of those folks if you go to the one
[02:55:40.840 --> 02:55:43.760]  of the end games with I don't know like two and a half million views on YouTube
[02:55:43.760 --> 02:55:46.080]  but you could see where they were claiming they own it and they own my
[02:55:46.080 --> 02:55:49.640]  voice and they've got their stuff up for sale there hijacking my video I'm
[02:55:49.640 --> 02:55:54.000]  getting really angry about that this is what they can do to censor us as well
[02:55:54.000 --> 02:55:58.160]  just say my voice is copyright and have computers remove it worldwide that's the
[02:55:58.160 --> 02:56:02.480]  type of dangerous systems that are out there and I said to this nice fellow
[02:56:02.480 --> 02:56:07.000]  again he was like are you remember the NRA okay good I am I am he thought
[02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:10.800]  because I didn't want the military operating domestically I could do a
[02:56:10.800 --> 02:56:14.840]  whole piece just analyzing this guy as a good guy who doesn't understand he's
[02:56:14.840 --> 02:56:17.880]  like you're talking about about the military running drones are you with
[02:56:17.880 --> 02:56:23.640]  the do you like the NRA as a litmus test and I said yeah I've been to urban
[02:56:23.640 --> 02:56:27.200]  warfare drills where the military is trying to take our guns and he's like
[02:56:27.200 --> 02:56:33.320]  oh I know that I believe that I'm like but but then you think I'm a hippie
[02:56:33.320 --> 02:56:37.960]  because I don't want armed drones flying around that are autonomous and I was
[02:56:37.960 --> 02:56:42.360]  talking about autonomous drones he didn't believe that in LA Times Navy launches
[02:56:42.360 --> 02:56:46.040]  autonomous helicopters and drones pre-programmed to go out and kill they've
[02:56:46.040 --> 02:56:50.720]  had them for ten years they're just now telling you about autonomous ones they've
[02:56:50.720 --> 02:56:56.320]  got autonomous robot driven space planes according to the first head of Star Wars
[02:56:56.320 --> 02:57:01.720]  program physicist and Air Force Colonel Dr. Bob Bowman he can only say because
[02:57:01.720 --> 02:57:05.560]  they accidentally declassified part of it I really pressed him at that big
[02:57:05.560 --> 02:57:10.200]  convention we had in LA back in 2006 he said alright I'll tell you this he goes
[02:57:10.200 --> 02:57:15.960]  by 79 because this leaked when another you know head of another program at
[02:57:15.960 --> 02:57:21.600]  DARPA on C-SPAN debating me admitted it that in the late 70s we had a fleet of
[02:57:21.600 --> 02:57:28.040]  space planes with DU Shabo basically meteor gun technology orbiting the globe
[02:57:28.040 --> 02:57:33.160]  as decapitation weapons they can knock out bases is three miles under a mountain
[02:57:33.160 --> 02:57:39.360]  you can't dig really three miles down of its sea level because it gets too high
[02:57:39.360 --> 02:57:42.160]  that's why they put bases under mountains because you're technically miles
[02:57:42.160 --> 02:57:46.920]  under rock but it's right it's it's above sea level still for flooding and
[02:57:46.920 --> 02:57:51.520]  things in caves and the temperature differential more than about 67 degrees
[02:57:51.520 --> 02:57:55.360]  that's a side issue getting off into underground base deep underground base
[02:57:55.360 --> 02:58:00.560]  theorem I'm gonna just stop right there we're gonna have a big M4 Wars nightly
[02:58:00.560 --> 02:58:05.000]  news tonight I'm gonna review total recall speaking of total information
