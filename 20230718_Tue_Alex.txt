[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.800]  First of all we have accusatory commentary of Soros DA's. Let us not put
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.920]  an individual that is not here, a contributing American, and jeopardizes
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.560]  life for always throwing his name out in the most ugliest of way. I am offended by
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.920]  that. Ladies and gentlemen, the system isn't gonna save you and isn't gonna be
[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.640]  there when this goes down. Mr. Soros does not deserve that. He is an American and
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:39.960]  a patriot. But if we work hard, the globalists won't come out on top of this
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.760]  collapse as the bosses to bring in a tyranny a thousand times worse. The
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.640]  problem is that the population is growing the fastest in the very poorest
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:55.880]  places and so it's really an acute problem in a certain number of places and
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.800]  we've got to make sure that we help out with the tools now so that they don't
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.160]  have an impossible situation later. That's their admitted plan. I like to call this
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:12.160]  idea creative capitalism, an approach where governments, businesses, and
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:18.760]  nonprofits work together to stretch the reach of market forces. So we better
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.760]  be fighting as hard as we can and fighting five times harder than these
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.800]  devils to be affecting the battle space psychologically with the truth, exposing
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.200]  that they did it, they're the ones behind it, here's what they're gonna try once
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.400]  the collapse accelerates so people don't comply with them during the collapse. It
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.640]  is about having a world government, a new world order. They are the ones who will
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:50.760]  govern the world. The affirmative task we have now is to actually create a new
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:56.120]  world order. There was to be a government by these elites who will
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:04.800]  impose their rules on everyone in this world and for those who are unwilling to
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:11.760]  submit to them there will be punishment. Now the population of the world is 7
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:18.480]  billion. There will be a need to kill many billions of people or to stop them
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.520]  to death or to prevent them from giving birth in order to reduce the population
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.880]  of this world. Because they're gonna release a new virus and you know be
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.440]  locking people up and promising to bring back the good times if you just take
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.200]  your shot or oh if your neighbor went away but Bob was causing a problem and
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.520]  not going along with it you know they're the non compliers you'll get your
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:46.440]  electricity back. So we you know we'll have to prepare for the next one that you
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.000]  know I'd say is will get attention this time. You're being put in the
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.320]  process of being once free now being a slave. Like the Bank of England already
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:03.680]  prepared their microchip implant RFID chip to be implanted under your skin and
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.560]  why is the sudden discussion about universal basic income from all the
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.480]  grassroots and inverted commas movements and billionaires oh you know it's basically
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.320]  it was the bribe for you to accept the microchip. The downside of government
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.600]  being able to track digitally every single product or service you buy and
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:26.200]  sell is chilling. CBDC can improve financial inclusion is through what we
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:32.600]  call programmability. They think you're weak they think you're stupid. What we
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.520]  have seen so far it's corporations and governments collecting data about where
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:44.600]  we go, who we meet, what movies we watch. The next phase is the surveillance going
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.720]  under our skin. We now see mass surveillance systems established even in
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:55.360]  democratic countries which previously rejected them and we also see a change in
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:01.400]  the nature of surveillance. Previously surveillance was mainly above the skin
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.200]  now it's going under the skin. I don't hate the military I don't hate the
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.520]  Border Patrol but they're just like average Americans they follow criminal
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:15.400]  orders. Is there a crisis at our southern border? Senator there is a very
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.440]  significant. That's a yes or no question. Is there a crisis? Mr.
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.320]  Secretary I want to say to you right now your behavior is disgraceful and the
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.200]  deaths the children assaulted the children raped they are at your feet and
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.760]  if you had integrity you would resign. Just keep pretending everybody that we
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:40.960]  aren't overrun. You me or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life but it ain't
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.920]  about how hard you hit it's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.720]  forward how much you can take and keep moving forward. That's how winning is
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.000]  done. Nobody's coming to save you but yourself. Nobody's coming to save you
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.200]  nobody's coming to save you nobody's coming to save you. With all the
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.680]  craziness in the world the collapsing borders the war with Russia the
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:11.080]  insanity the currency devaluations the economy going crazy. You are crazy in my
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.400]  view if you don't get high-quality storable food and water filtration and
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.320]  self-defense. Now we're not selling guns and ammo that's for you to go out and
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.120]  get for yourself and learn how to use if you haven't and I'm preaching the
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.760]  choir on that but a lot of people got plenty of guns but they don't have
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.040]  enough storable food or water filtration. This is something you need now and we've
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.560]  got it in the food department and in the high-quality water filtration
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.360]  department. The highest quality food the best water filtration at the lowest
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.640]  prices you're gonna find and still get quality. Infowarsstore.com is running a
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:45.920]  special right now for 10% off on all storable food and on water and air
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:50.280]  filtration. Ladies and gentlemen you cannot beat this deal our prices are

[00:05:59.548 --> 00:06:20.548]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:06:20.548 --> 00:06:35.668]  I demand that Congress do the right thing and only count the electors who have been
[00:06:35.668 --> 00:06:40.628]  lawfully slated, lawfully slated.
[00:06:40.628 --> 00:06:45.908]  I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully
[00:06:45.908 --> 00:06:49.707]  and patriotically make your voices heard.
[00:06:49.707 --> 00:06:57.348]  Today we will see whether Republicans stand strong for integrity of our elections, but
[00:06:57.348 --> 00:07:02.868]  whether or not they stand strong for our country.
[00:07:02.868 --> 00:07:07.068]  That was President Trump on January 6th, 2021.
[00:07:07.068 --> 00:07:13.188]  I was there in the second row right in front of him and we had every intention of marching
[00:07:13.188 --> 00:07:17.388]  peacefully as we've done in hundreds of marches around the country and several to the Capitol
[00:07:17.388 --> 00:07:22.468]  just in the months before to then show the world that Biden couldn't get a big crowd
[00:07:22.468 --> 00:07:27.028]  at his events, that we had big crowds at our events and push for what the Democrats had
[00:07:27.028 --> 00:07:31.268]  done many times before, the challenging of an election in the U.S. Senate with a 10-day
[00:07:31.268 --> 00:07:32.268]  investigation.
[00:07:32.268 --> 00:07:36.828]  I can play you hours of compilations of them going back over the decades, but just 8, 9,
[00:07:36.828 --> 00:07:40.588]  10 years ago saying this election's a fraud, we're challenging the electors, we're bringing
[00:07:40.588 --> 00:07:42.668]  forth our own electors.
[00:07:42.668 --> 00:07:48.688]  You have the Democratic Party of the New York Times, Hillary Clinton, John Podesta saying
[00:07:48.688 --> 00:07:55.068]  a month before the election in 2020 that we don't care if he wins, we're not going to accept
[00:07:55.068 --> 00:07:59.948]  the results and we're going to have our own inauguration somewhere else in the country
[00:07:59.948 --> 00:08:00.948]  for Joe Biden.
[00:08:00.948 --> 00:08:06.188]  Then they said, oh, the red mirage, it'll look like he's going to win and then he'll
[00:08:06.188 --> 00:08:10.508]  really lose weeks after from the mail-in ballots, wink, wink.
[00:08:10.508 --> 00:08:12.707]  And the rest is history.
[00:08:12.707 --> 00:08:16.748]  So now Trump has come out this morning in a press release, it's on InfoWars.com, let's
[00:08:16.748 --> 00:08:22.188]  put the live show feed up because it boils it down the best, and said he's been told
[00:08:22.188 --> 00:08:28.707]  by the FBI and Justice Department in a targeting letter that he is the main target of a grand
[00:08:28.707 --> 00:08:34.348]  jury, that he has four days to be ready to appear before the grand jury, and at that
[00:08:34.348 --> 00:08:37.708]  point they'll probably sneak attack him and indict him and arrest him on the spot and
[00:08:37.708 --> 00:08:40.488]  may even try to put him in the D.C. jail.
[00:08:40.488 --> 00:08:43.688]  They own D.C., 94% Democrat.
[00:08:43.688 --> 00:08:47.248]  They could, again, send a newborn baby to the gas chamber if the Democrat ordered a
[00:08:47.248 --> 00:08:49.888]  jury tube.
[00:08:49.888 --> 00:08:54.448]  Trump received target letter from Biden's DOJ, says they will arrest and indict him
[00:08:54.448 --> 00:08:59.608]  over January 6th, just like he said Alvin Bragg was going to indict him and have him
[00:08:59.608 --> 00:09:04.768]  turn himself in, and it happened, and just like he said, again, they would do it with
[00:09:04.768 --> 00:09:10.648]  the presidential document issues, because after all, you can't have a president with
[00:09:10.648 --> 00:09:12.608]  any presidential documents.
[00:09:12.608 --> 00:09:19.208]  It belongs to bureaucracy, not to the president we elected, and now he's saying this is imminent.
[00:09:19.208 --> 00:09:24.728]  This is beyond a constitutional crisis, ladies and gentlemen, this is the globalists completing
[00:09:24.728 --> 00:09:29.288]  the coup that they've been involved in over this country for a long time.
[00:09:29.288 --> 00:09:32.448]  They have control of the federal government, they have control of many state governments,
[00:09:32.448 --> 00:09:38.128]  they have control of 900-plus district attorneys, county attorneys, 20-plus state attorney
[00:09:38.128 --> 00:09:42.048]  generals, but they want to complete the total control with their surveillance and their
[00:09:42.048 --> 00:09:51.768]  censorship and the pushing by the puppet president, Biden's, just Obama's puppet, that anyone
[00:09:51.768 --> 00:09:58.048]  challenging elections, anyone challenging open borders, anyone challenging any type of tyranny
[00:09:58.048 --> 00:10:01.248]  is a white supremacist and is a terrorist and is an enemy.
[00:10:01.248 --> 00:10:06.648]  So they're outlawing their political opposition in front of the whole world right now.
[00:10:06.648 --> 00:10:09.008]  They're converting us to a classical tyranny.
[00:10:09.008 --> 00:10:15.088]  Our country is occupied by an out-of-control bureaucracy that controls the intelligence
[00:10:15.088 --> 00:10:20.127]  agencies, the Pentagon, almost everything, at the top, who have been put in positions
[00:10:20.127 --> 00:10:28.568]  by the Larry Finks of the world that control this nation through fraud.
[00:10:28.568 --> 00:10:30.208]  Their agenda is completely unpopular.
[00:10:30.208 --> 00:10:32.928]  Their agenda is completely illegal.
[00:10:32.928 --> 00:10:36.568]  But nevertheless, they are moving forward with it, not just here, but around the world.
[00:10:36.568 --> 00:10:38.648]  This is a huge deal.
[00:10:38.648 --> 00:10:41.048]  We knew this was coming just two weeks ago.
[00:10:41.048 --> 00:10:50.208]  It broke in the Washington Post, a lengthy 20-page article saying that the D.C. prosecutors
[00:10:50.208 --> 00:10:57.248]  had come to the Justice Department a year and a half ago and said, we want to indict
[00:10:57.248 --> 00:11:03.808]  Roger Stone and Alex Jones, claiming that we got orders from Trump to attack the Capitol
[00:11:03.808 --> 00:11:04.808]  with no evidence.
[00:11:04.808 --> 00:11:11.568]  And the DOJ said, Merrick Garland said, no, you didn't complete evidence from the bottom
[00:11:11.568 --> 00:11:14.728]  to the top that they were connected to Trump.
[00:11:14.728 --> 00:11:20.568]  We're going after Trump for challenge the election, period, and saying that that was
[00:11:20.568 --> 00:11:24.208]  an attempt to set up a coup d'etat.
[00:11:24.208 --> 00:11:30.748]  And so with no evidence, they're preparing to indict the president.
[00:11:30.748 --> 00:11:36.568]  They indicted him in D.C., but the Supreme Court has ruled that you have to try somebody
[00:11:36.568 --> 00:11:38.648]  where their crime was committed.
[00:11:38.648 --> 00:11:44.408]  So he supposedly has the stolen documents that were his at Mar-a-Lago, the nearest federal
[00:11:44.408 --> 00:11:46.808]  courthouse is in Miami.
[00:11:46.808 --> 00:11:48.648]  And so that's where that trial is happening.
[00:11:48.648 --> 00:11:52.728]  And by luck of the draw, it's a judge that Trump put in that hopefully is fairer.
[00:11:52.728 --> 00:11:54.008]  So they're a little panicked by that.
[00:11:54.008 --> 00:11:58.528]  We're talking about indicting him in New Jersey, where he had documents at his golf club.
[00:11:58.528 --> 00:12:01.808]  And of course, the January 6th indictment is going to be the key one.
[00:12:01.808 --> 00:12:05.688]  And then they have to legitimize that he's really a terrorist and have his supporters
[00:12:05.688 --> 00:12:07.648]  supposedly stage events.
[00:12:07.648 --> 00:12:13.528]  And that's when you're going to see January 6th on steroids, where the deep state, the
[00:12:13.528 --> 00:12:20.468]  NGOs stage massive shootings, massive bombings, chemical attacks on apartment buildings, chemical
[00:12:20.468 --> 00:12:21.608]  weapons dumped in lakes.
[00:12:21.608 --> 00:12:27.448]  I'm giving you a smattering of what they're, from my research, up to.
[00:12:27.448 --> 00:12:29.008]  All to be blamed on us.
[00:12:29.008 --> 00:12:36.488]  Then they cut one of the main power grids off, one of the big six, and blame it on us.
[00:12:36.488 --> 00:12:40.328]  And I told you before they floated that last month that that's what I would do if I was
[00:12:40.328 --> 00:12:41.328]  them.
[00:12:41.328 --> 00:12:44.688]  Because I can already see the pre-programming that power outages are imminent, cyber attacks
[00:12:44.688 --> 00:12:45.688]  are imminent.
[00:12:45.688 --> 00:12:49.208]  They don't want to actually attack the infrastructure with .50 caliber rifles or something that
[00:12:49.208 --> 00:12:53.608]  the Congress has had hearings on that can easily be done with any caliber rifle, quite
[00:12:53.608 --> 00:12:57.288]  frankly, but just take more rounds with a smaller caliber.
[00:12:57.288 --> 00:13:04.608]  A hundred people put in the right places around the country in two hours could shut down most
[00:13:04.608 --> 00:13:07.968]  of the grid shooting the key transformers.
[00:13:07.968 --> 00:13:10.168]  And they know that they should be shielded.
[00:13:10.168 --> 00:13:14.208]  They could shield them for a hundred million dollars, just put a little bit of armor around
[00:13:14.208 --> 00:13:15.208]  each one.
[00:13:15.208 --> 00:13:16.528]  But they don't do that.
[00:13:16.528 --> 00:13:17.928]  They've decided to leave that there.
[00:13:18.008 --> 00:13:20.488]  They're not saying that's how they're going to attack, because that would actually take
[00:13:20.488 --> 00:13:21.488]  the power off.
[00:13:21.488 --> 00:13:25.328]  The globalists want the power for now, literal and figurative.
[00:13:25.328 --> 00:13:29.208]  So instead, I predicted they would not say it was going to be weapons or bombs taking
[00:13:29.208 --> 00:13:35.568]  out the key control centers around the country, the switch centers.
[00:13:35.568 --> 00:13:43.528]  It would be a cyber attack blamed on the Russians working with Trump supporters.
[00:13:43.528 --> 00:13:45.848]  And then sure enough, I've been saying that for two years, sure enough, they come out
[00:13:45.848 --> 00:13:51.448]  last month and say, FBI bulletin, the Trump supporters working with the Russians are going
[00:13:51.448 --> 00:13:55.328]  to shut the power off using a cyber attack, and then they'll have to cut the Internet
[00:13:55.328 --> 00:13:56.328]  off.
[00:13:56.328 --> 00:14:01.608]  I predicted this too, the Internet kill switch, so that the evil right-wingers can't attack
[00:14:01.608 --> 00:14:04.528]  through the Internet and keep the power off.
[00:14:04.528 --> 00:14:08.528]  And then, oh my gosh, we've got to have an Internet ID after they turn the power back
[00:14:08.528 --> 00:14:09.528]  on.
[00:14:09.528 --> 00:14:13.488]  Only if you sign up online, sign up at an approved government site that you'll be able
[00:14:13.488 --> 00:14:16.208]  to go to, will you then get access to the web?
[00:14:16.208 --> 00:14:18.648]  And now they've got the Internet ID in place.
[00:14:18.648 --> 00:14:27.127]  Now they've got the social credit score, carbon tax, vaccine passport, node, skip this break,
[00:14:27.127 --> 00:14:30.088]  in place.
[00:14:30.088 --> 00:14:33.808]  And so they know exactly what they're doing.
[00:14:33.808 --> 00:14:38.848]  And I specifically laid all this out from their pre-brainwashing.
[00:14:38.848 --> 00:14:44.688]  I can see the next few pieces they would lay, and now they've...
[00:14:44.688 --> 00:14:47.768]  The only thing left now is for them to pull it off.
[00:14:47.768 --> 00:14:52.848]  Now, remember, the average leftist, the average person out there is still not awake.
[00:14:52.848 --> 00:14:57.608]  And if they don't have Internet or they don't have power, they're going to blame whoever
[00:14:57.608 --> 00:15:03.248]  the government and the media blames to get that back on.
[00:15:03.248 --> 00:15:06.928]  Just like, just take the shot and they'll let you out of the house.
[00:15:07.008 --> 00:15:09.168]  They'll stay in your house for 15 days and they'll let you out.
[00:15:09.168 --> 00:15:11.888]  Oh, sorry, it's two years.
[00:15:11.888 --> 00:15:12.888]  Just take the shot.
[00:15:12.888 --> 00:15:13.888]  One shot, you're covered.
[00:15:13.888 --> 00:15:14.888]  100%.
[00:15:14.888 --> 00:15:15.888]  Sorry, it's two.
[00:15:15.888 --> 00:15:18.208]  No, I'm at three, five, eight, nine, 10.
[00:15:18.208 --> 00:15:19.208]  It's a weekly shot.
[00:15:19.208 --> 00:15:20.208]  I'm sorry.
[00:15:20.208 --> 00:15:24.008]  And it doesn't protect you, but I forget why I'm taking shots.
[00:15:24.008 --> 00:15:29.168]  So it's all about roping the dope, because if you remember, the general public, the way
[00:15:29.168 --> 00:15:33.088]  television has been designed in the last 70 years, this is on record, is to shorten attention
[00:15:33.088 --> 00:15:35.448]  spans down to less than 12 seconds.
[00:15:35.448 --> 00:15:40.488]  The average person has less than a 12 second attention span.
[00:15:40.488 --> 00:15:43.248]  A goldfish has a little over that, 14.
[00:15:43.248 --> 00:15:47.208]  So you've seen like Dory, who's not a goldfish, but it's a similar fish, doesn't have an attention
[00:15:47.208 --> 00:15:48.208]  span.
[00:15:48.208 --> 00:15:52.368]  That's a known species that doesn't remember who you are second to second.
[00:15:52.368 --> 00:15:57.448]  The public, most of the public is not even mentally retarded.
[00:15:57.448 --> 00:16:02.568]  They're just been brainwashed and programmed to have no attention span.
[00:16:02.568 --> 00:16:08.048]  That's why they hate the clips of me 15 years ago, 10 years ago, five years ago, predicting
[00:16:08.048 --> 00:16:11.888]  this word for word, because people see those clips and it's a younger Alex Jones.
[00:16:11.888 --> 00:16:14.008]  They see the date and they go, well, that's exactly what happened.
[00:16:14.008 --> 00:16:15.808]  How the hell does this guy know this?
[00:16:15.808 --> 00:16:21.088]  Well, because the enemy thinks you're a goldfish and has a plan.
[00:16:21.088 --> 00:16:25.968]  I'd liken it to the fictional movie.
[00:16:25.968 --> 00:16:31.188]  What was the fictional movie where the aliens are able to time travel back in time every
[00:16:31.188 --> 00:16:37.548]  time they start losing a battle and then end up defeating the humans?
[00:16:37.548 --> 00:16:40.468]  They land in Paris and it's a Tom Cruise movie.
[00:16:40.468 --> 00:16:42.468]  What's it called?
[00:16:42.468 --> 00:16:48.908]  No, that's not what it's called.
[00:16:48.908 --> 00:16:54.748]  They changed the title from Day After Tomorrow to whatever it is, live, die, repeat, live,
[00:16:54.748 --> 00:16:55.748]  die, repeat.
[00:16:55.748 --> 00:16:56.748]  Yeah.
[00:16:56.748 --> 00:16:57.748]  So it's kind of the same deal.
[00:16:58.308 --> 00:17:04.228]  Someone without an attention span who doesn't access all their memory literally is like waking
[00:17:04.228 --> 00:17:05.348]  up new all the time.
[00:17:05.348 --> 00:17:09.788]  So the humans are always in the same position and wondering why the aliens are kicking their
[00:17:09.788 --> 00:17:14.668]  ass because it turns out they've already had like 500 battles with us.
[00:17:14.668 --> 00:17:17.268]  And so in your memory, you think you're getting your ass kicked right away.
[00:17:17.268 --> 00:17:18.268]  No, no, no.
[00:17:18.268 --> 00:17:19.388]  They've got long-term memory.
[00:17:19.388 --> 00:17:21.188]  They've been strategically playing it out.
[00:17:21.188 --> 00:17:25.348]  All you've got to do is access your long-term memory.
[00:17:25.348 --> 00:17:29.988]  All you've got to do is start literally realizing they write books and white papers and say,
[00:17:29.988 --> 00:17:33.148]  we're going to take everything you've got, we're going to cut your resources off, we're
[00:17:33.148 --> 00:17:34.828]  going to slowly starve you to death.
[00:17:34.828 --> 00:17:37.427]  But because you don't have a memory, we'll do it in steps.
[00:17:37.427 --> 00:17:41.268]  And you'll actually think we're the saviors as we take it away from you piece by piece
[00:17:41.268 --> 00:17:42.268]  by piece.
[00:17:42.268 --> 00:17:45.548]  I mean, folks, this is so simple.
[00:17:45.548 --> 00:17:49.988]  And the power of having a memory, the power of reading their plans, and then knowing they're
[00:17:49.988 --> 00:17:53.748]  going to carry them out and being able to know what their next move is, we have their
[00:17:53.748 --> 00:17:56.668]  battle plan.
[00:17:56.668 --> 00:18:05.228]  But because you won't have a memory, or because you won't value having a memory, then what
[00:18:05.228 --> 00:18:08.988]  would happen?
[00:18:08.988 --> 00:18:11.268]  You see?
[00:18:11.268 --> 00:18:16.828]  But one character in this fictional world, Tom Cruise, for some reason, does have a memory
[00:18:16.828 --> 00:18:19.028]  each time he gets killed and remember.
[00:18:19.028 --> 00:18:24.708]  So one human has some weird evolutionary mind warp or something that he's able to psychically
[00:18:24.708 --> 00:18:30.548]  tune into the mothership alien pod brain, I'm going from memory, I only saw it once.
[00:18:30.548 --> 00:18:32.388]  I'm watching the movie again.
[00:18:32.388 --> 00:18:35.708]  And he's able to dial into the pod brain too, like the other aliens are.
[00:18:35.708 --> 00:18:41.108]  So one guy knows how to beat them, just because he has the knowledge of their long term plan.
[00:18:41.108 --> 00:18:44.588]  And folks, that's how this is, except this isn't a Tom Cruise movie.
[00:18:44.588 --> 00:18:45.588]  This is for real.
[00:18:45.588 --> 00:18:46.588]  Okay?
[00:18:46.588 --> 00:18:50.988]  I mean, these people are literally putting chemicals in the food and water that sterilize
[00:18:50.988 --> 00:18:51.988]  you.
[00:18:51.988 --> 00:18:56.908]  They're literally putting up 5G that kills even the birds that live by and the bees, not
[00:18:56.908 --> 00:18:58.388]  to mention you.
[00:18:58.388 --> 00:19:00.748]  We are literally already in the boiling pot.
[00:19:00.748 --> 00:19:03.188]  They are already carrying this out.
[00:19:03.188 --> 00:19:11.348]  And I am sitting here like Tom Cruise in Day After Tomorrow, knowing the whole battle plan,
[00:19:11.348 --> 00:19:14.148]  knowing what's going on, we'll put its IMDb up.
[00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:23.950]  Edge of tomorrow, edge of tomorrow.
[00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:26.550]  So that's where we are.
[00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:33.550]  And it's, it's time for people to realize we're on the edge of tomorrow.
[00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:36.830]  We are on the edge of oblivion here.
[00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:39.190]  Because I understand you want to go home eat a good dinner, you want to go home and watch
[00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:43.430]  your Netflix show, you want to go home and have sex with your wife, you want to go home
[00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:47.430]  and play ping pong or video games or go to the gym.
[00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:48.590]  And that's all fine and dandy.
[00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:53.510]  But while you're doing that, the globalists have a 50 year plan, 100 year plan, a 500 year
[00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:54.510]  plan.
[00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:56.830]  And they're carrying out this globalist plan against us.
[00:19:56.830 --> 00:20:00.870]  And we're now in the last 10% of the plan, where they start cutting all the resources
[00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:04.190]  off and having us fight with each other as everything collapses.
[00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:10.670]  But let me just get back to what I was gonna say.
[00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:15.230]  To have a president, now listen to me very, very carefully.
[00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:20.830]  All the evidence says Trump won the 2020 election by 15 points or so, but they were able with
[00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:25.150]  tens of millions of mail-in ballots and the database that Zuckerberg spent hundreds of
[00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:28.790]  millions on of dead people and people that had moved out of the districts, they were
[00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:34.830]  able to then have safe houses all over the key battleground states, about eight of them,
[00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:39.070]  go and fill out those with the people's info, get rid of the regulations, there has to be
[00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:45.670]  ID shown or signature verification, and they were able to steal it.
[00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:50.390]  After the polls closed, they were able to do it the next week.
[00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:52.070]  But that's not even the issue for debate.
[00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:58.510]  They censored the laptop, they blocked Republican information, they censored Trump supporters
[00:20:58.510 --> 00:21:02.870]  from going out and getting people to vote Trump, that was admitted election meddling.
[00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:06.750]  So they did steal the 2020 election any way you slice it.
[00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:14.750]  But now, undeniably, zero chance it's not happening, they are indicting over and over
[00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:22.230]  and over again, someone who's getting 75% of the votes in major polls against all other
[00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:23.230]  Republicans.
[00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:29.830]  You got like nine other Republicans running, Trump gets 75% against them in polls.
[00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:33.950]  He's 20 to 30 points, depending on the poll, ahead of Biden in every poll.
[00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:36.270]  At least 20 points ahead.
[00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:42.110]  Never in 100 plus years of modern polling has anybody ever been 25 points ahead of the
[00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:48.830]  Democrat nominee or the Democrat president or the presumptive nominee.
[00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:56.310]  That is 100% bonafide, the real McCoy, not just election meddling, it is precluding you,
[00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:58.550]  they're saying, from being able to vote for this man.
[00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:02.270]  And Biden said in December last year, it doesn't matter what Trump does.
[00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:04.070]  We're not going to let him get elected.
[00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:06.030]  We're going to use constitutional means.
[00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:10.670]  Well, the only constitutional means are criminal.
[00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:15.430]  It's in the Constitution that if somebody can be impeached if they're involved in all
[00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:17.630]  these crimes.
[00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:21.750]  So they're impeaching him not through Congress, they're both of their impeachments failed.
[00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:24.590]  I think the public's so stupid, they don't know that those failed.
[00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:28.070]  The House indicts you, the Senate tries you, it never got to the Senate.
[00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:33.190]  So they've already indicted him twice federally in Congress, and he beat those.
[00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:36.710]  And they had the fake Russiagate and all the rest of that crap.
[00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:42.030]  And then now they're bringing forward multiple federal indictments, state indictments, because
[00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:45.510]  Georgia is about to do it as well, not just New York with Alvin Bragg.
[00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:48.830]  I mean, this is coup d'etat.
[00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:53.350]  You always hear about third world countries where, well, the high court and the Congress
[00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:56.390]  have had the former president indicted during the campaign.
[00:22:56.390 --> 00:23:06.150]  We all go, man, how dare them do that in Nicaragua or someplace like Venezuela.
[00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:10.550]  So you see the headlines, Trump target January 6 probe, indictment watch, Republicans debate
[00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:11.950]  impeaching Attorney General.
[00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:14.670]  Yes, that needs to happen immediately.
[00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:19.550]  We have to get back on the offense because people say, oh, that's meddling in government
[00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:20.550]  to impeach.
[00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:22.350]  No, that's Congress's power.
[00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:27.230]  This is the bureaucracy and the sitting president that stole the election, that couldn't get
[00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:34.990]  10 people in his rallies, literally, going and shutting down the incredibly popular president
[00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:36.510]  they stole the election from.
[00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:42.350]  And if you doubt that, they had Elias, the Democrat lawyer, run around in eight different
[00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:47.750]  states, nine different states, and try to get courts to preclude Marjorie Taylor Greene
[00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:52.550]  and Gozer and a bunch of others from being able to run again, saying, because you were
[00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:57.350]  in the Capitol on January 6 as elected members of Congress, it's your fault protesters were
[00:23:57.350 --> 00:24:03.510]  there by extension, guilt by association, so you can't run for Congress because you're
[00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:06.830]  winning by 20 points as MTG did.
[00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:13.510]  Well, Trump's set to win not by 20 points, 21 points, which is the largest winning margin
[00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:16.390]  for a Republican is MTG.
[00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:20.470]  She wins by the biggest landslide.
[00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:26.430]  And now Trump's got a bigger landslide ready, and they say, you can't have Trump.
[00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:29.270]  You can't have who you want.
[00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:34.110]  Even if I didn't like Trump, I would say this is wrong.
[00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:38.550]  I mean, I don't like Obama, and he was a horrible person, but he did get elected.
[00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:39.550]  He was popular.
[00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:40.950]  He was able to con people.
[00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:44.550]  That's not the case with Biden, and we all know that.
[00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:49.150]  And so the deep state is destroying our country.
[00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:50.350]  They're starting World War III.
[00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:51.550]  Trump has pledged to stop it.
[00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:52.550]  The U.S. runs it.
[00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:53.550]  Of course he can stop it.
[00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:55.950]  They're like, how are you going to stop it like that?
[00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:57.110]  He's pledged to control the border.
[00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:58.230]  He's pledged to bring jobs back.
[00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:01.990]  He's pledged to get legislation in so they can't force you to take shots.
[00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:03.390]  He says he'll make the military take him.
[00:25:03.390 --> 00:25:04.390]  He's not perfect.
[00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:07.230]  But ladies and gentlemen, he's not out to get us.
[00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:11.770]  He isn't banning oil drilling all over the country and gas drilling and draining our
[00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:17.610]  strategic reserve down to almost nothing while asking Saudi Arabia to increase output
[00:25:17.610 --> 00:25:19.130]  at our expense.
[00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:23.490]  The globalists are trying to break our will, make us poor, to put us all on welfare, to
[00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:24.490]  run our lives.
[00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:26.330]  Cloward and Pivot, that's their plan.
[00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:29.290]  And it is such a big deal.
[00:25:29.290 --> 00:25:36.570]  It is so unbelievably over the top and so tone deaf that this maniac Justice Department
[00:25:36.570 --> 00:25:40.690]  with the above the law Biden and his son, the crackhead pedophiles and the cocaine in
[00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:46.290]  the White House and the Chinese spies and the groping of kids in public and just all
[00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:48.050]  the bizarreness.
[00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:54.330]  And then you've got them going after this straight laced person compared to them, Donald
[00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:56.330]  Trump, with all these fake indictments.
[00:25:56.330 --> 00:25:58.490]  They are insane to try this.
[00:25:58.490 --> 00:25:59.690]  They are crazy.
[00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:04.730]  Do they think if he went up 10, 20, 30 points with the first indictment and the second indictment,
[00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:05.730]  the third?
[00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:11.450]  Do they think when he's in front of a D.C. kangaroo operation, that circus, then what
[00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:12.450]  do you think that's going to?
[00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:14.250]  Well, I know what their plan is.
[00:26:14.250 --> 00:26:18.010]  Any way you slice it, the globalists will be destroyed by this politically, except the
[00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:20.710]  false flag.
[00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:25.210]  First press conference Biden had with Psaki, he said, anybody questioning open borders,
[00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:30.090]  the election or forced injections or lockdowns is a terrorist.
[00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:34.170]  And worse, our main directive for the agencies is to fight with the American people and to
[00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:35.490]  surveil them and go after them.
[00:26:35.490 --> 00:26:39.970]  And then he put it under U.S. directive in June of that same year, saying the American
[00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:41.790]  people are the number one enemy.
[00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:43.010]  What an incredible statement.
[00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:44.330]  I made a big deal about it.
[00:26:44.330 --> 00:26:47.250]  Now they've mainlined that and they admit that.
[00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:50.370]  You go and you don't want your kid being taught how to have sex with adults.
[00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:54.290]  You don't want triple X child porn in your school.
[00:26:54.290 --> 00:26:55.610]  The FBI is coming after you.
[00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:56.610]  Well, you know what?
[00:26:56.610 --> 00:26:59.610]  Get all of us then.
[00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:04.010]  But see, they're going to cut the power.
[00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:06.330]  They're going to take the Internet.
[00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:12.410]  They're going to make January 6th persecution of the American people look like child's play
[00:27:12.410 --> 00:27:15.610]  because that was just the beginning to brand us as the enemy.
[00:27:15.610 --> 00:27:17.410]  And what was that based on?
[00:27:17.410 --> 00:27:18.690]  Provocateurs.
[00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:22.490]  The D.C. police attacking the Capitol police dressed as Trump supporters.
[00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:23.490]  Antifa.
[00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:24.490]  Same deal.
[00:27:24.490 --> 00:27:28.530]  Ray Epps orchestrating, in his own words, all of it.
[00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:29.530]  They're not going to.
[00:27:29.530 --> 00:27:31.250]  I don't believe they're going to indict Ray Epps.
[00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:35.090]  That's his lawyers saying that in a filing to make it sound like he was indicted.
[00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:37.890]  People believe he's been indicted now because you have a short memory.
[00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:38.890]  People tell me, no, no.
[00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:39.890]  Ray Epps was indicted.
[00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:44.050]  I get my phone and I go, no, his lawyers say they said he may be indicted.
[00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:45.290]  Oh, I thought he was indicted.
[00:27:45.290 --> 00:27:46.490]  See, it's all mind games.
[00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:51.030]  And even if they do, they'll drop the prosecution later because people know, wait, he's ramming
[00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:52.370]  signs into people.
[00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:53.370]  He's the first to break in.
[00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:55.250]  He says, go into the Capitol for days.
[00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:56.650]  He's there that day.
[00:27:56.650 --> 00:27:58.390]  And then the media says he's an angel.
[00:27:58.390 --> 00:28:02.350]  And Owen Schroer has been charged at the Capitol outside trying to stop people getting
[00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:04.750]  in.
[00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:08.550]  So they'll probably will maybe indict him, but just on the surface, because they're getting
[00:28:08.550 --> 00:28:14.630]  ready to indict the president of the United States, who is the front runner against the
[00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:18.350]  Republicans and Democrats in the primary and general election.
[00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:19.810]  That is criminal.
[00:28:19.810 --> 00:28:21.270]  That is outrageous.
[00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:25.230]  And that on a scale of one to 10 on tyranny is a 10, baby.
[00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:27.930]  That is the end of the republic as we know it.
[00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:31.970]  But these cokehead maniac pedophiles that run the Justice Department at the top were
[00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:35.930]  put in there because they're full of hate of this country and bravado and chutzpah.
[00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:38.530]  And they're going for the juggler of this country right now.
[00:28:38.530 --> 00:28:42.570]  And when they're done, when they're done setting off bombs and blaming it on the American
[00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:47.570]  people, they're going to take everything you've got, including your children's genitals.
[00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:51.050]  They're going to have lawnmowers out there just chopping your son's balls off.
[00:28:51.050 --> 00:28:55.290]  I mean, these are psychotic pedophiles, mad dog.
[00:28:55.290 --> 00:28:56.290]  They want our blood.
[00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:00.930]  The globalists are only humans.
[00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:02.930]  Yeah, they have control of the central banks.
[00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:05.930]  They have a lot of power, but they can be defeated.
[00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:08.930]  But some of their operations are going to take decades to stop.
[00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:12.930]  But one thing you can do right now is take control of your body and your family's body
[00:29:12.930 --> 00:29:16.930]  by purifying the water that you drink and that you cook with.
[00:29:16.930 --> 00:29:20.930]  And you do it with the highest quality gravity fed filter out there.
[00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:22.930]  This thing does 10,000 gallons.
[00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:25.930]  You can sit there and put hundreds of gallons through it a day.
[00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:29.930]  It purifies very quickly and it cuts out thousands of chemicals to non-detectable levels.
[00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:31.930]  This is what I use, what my family uses.
[00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:33.930]  It's the very best system out there for the lowest price.
[00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:36.930]  For a limited time, 10% off on top of that.

[00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:52.930]  This is one of the main areas we can take control of our lives and stop the globalists
[00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:54.930]  from hitting us with poison that they allow in the water supply.
[00:29:54.930 --> 00:29:57.930]  In some cases, they add the water supply like fluoride.
[00:29:57.930 --> 00:30:02.930]  In the short time we have, I can't get into all the incredible ingredients in Superfemale Vitality.
[00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:06.930]  Go to InfowarStore.com, read about the ingredients, look them up for yourself,

[00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:22.930]  Only a few hundred bottles left.
[00:30:22.930 --> 00:30:26.930]  But the good news is we have several thousand bottles left of Superfemale Vitality.
[00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:27.930]  That's the same formula.
[00:30:27.930 --> 00:30:28.930]  It boosts men.
[00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:29.930]  It boosts women.
[00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:30.930]  It works great.
[00:30:30.930 --> 00:30:32.930]  But women like pink labels.
[00:30:32.930 --> 00:30:34.930]  Men like different color labels.
[00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:36.930]  So it works for men as well.
[00:30:36.930 --> 00:30:37.930]  It's the same formula.
[00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:39.930]  It's an incredible formula, and it funds our operation.
[00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:42.930]  And here's another important part of the overall information.

[00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:15.930]  Every 15 days, every month, every 3 months, every 6 months, up to 9 months,
[00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:18.930]  you can go in and every month or every week,
[00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:19.930]  whenever you want, you program it.

[00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:27.930]  That way, we get 95% of it after credit card fees instead of making 20%, 30%,
[00:31:27.930 --> 00:31:28.930]  40% like we do on the products.
[00:31:28.930 --> 00:31:30.930]  But these really are amazing products.
[00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:32.930]  The Big July 4 sale is going on right now.
[00:31:32.930 --> 00:31:35.930]  This is such a critical platform in the fight against the New World Order.
[00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:37.930]  The enemies out in the open were vindicated.
[00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:38.930]  People are listening more than ever.
[00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:41.930]  But in this major recession, going into depression,
[00:31:41.930 --> 00:31:43.930]  and with supply chain breakdowns, I know it's hard.
[00:31:43.930 --> 00:31:44.930]  I know times are tough.
[00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:46.930]  So thank you for your support.
[00:31:46.930 --> 00:31:49.930]  But whatever you do, pray for the broadcast and share the articles and the videos.
[00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:51.930]  That you can do for free.
[00:31:51.930 --> 00:31:53.930]  And that's just as important as keeping us on air.
[00:31:53.930 --> 00:31:56.930]  So however God leads you in your heart to support us, please support us now.
[00:31:56.930 --> 00:31:58.930]  And I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[00:31:58.930 --> 00:31:59.930]  God bless you.
[00:31:59.930 --> 00:32:00.930]  You wanted to plug RainForce.
[00:32:00.930 --> 00:32:01.930]  Do you like RainForce?
[00:32:01.930 --> 00:32:02.930]  Yeah.
[00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:03.930]  So my name is Ken Heckin-Ladley.
[00:32:03.930 --> 00:32:05.930]  How do I write all the books that I do?
[00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:07.930]  Four books with Dr. Judy Mykovitz.
[00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:09.930]  Four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers.
[00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:11.930]  And now two books with Alex Jones.
[00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:15.930]  That's because I use RainForce every day.
[00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:19.930]  What I always need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning.
[00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:23.930]  And so, you know, I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins.
[00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:28.930]  But the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is RainForce.
[00:32:28.930 --> 00:32:32.930]  I'll take RainForce in the morning right before I go to my computer.
[00:32:32.930 --> 00:32:36.930]  And I'm good for the next four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff.
[00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:41.930]  So it really is true that RainForce is something I use every day.
[00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:42.930]  And it helps me with my writing.
[00:32:42.930 --> 00:32:43.930]  All right.
[00:32:43.930 --> 00:32:44.930]  We love you.
[00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:49.930]  Get your RainForce Plus, RainForce Ultra, and TurboForce at infowarstore.com.
[00:32:49.930 --> 00:32:50.930]  We'll be right back with hour number two.
[00:33:00.930 --> 00:33:06.930]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:34.659]  Alright, Roger Stone with the huge news that Trump is set to be indicted according to Trump's
[00:33:34.659 --> 00:33:39.940]  lawyers and President Trump as early as next week, maybe even tomorrow, as early as tomorrow
[00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:47.980]  in the district of Mordor, hell on the Potomac, the incredibly rigged court system.
[00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:51.460]  This is just terrible news.
[00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:52.460]  But we knew it was coming.
[00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:59.460]  Jack Smith is a U.N. operative, he's one of the most overturned prosecutors in history
[00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:05.740]  because he engages in witch hunt after witch hunt, but they chose him because he does engage
[00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:12.940]  in so much fraud and bullying of witnesses, blackmailing of witnesses, paying off witnesses.
[00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:14.940]  That's all coming out as well.
[00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:20.860]  So this is a very hardcore, serious group of criminals we're dealing with.
[00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:24.500]  And they've been tasked with completing their dictatorial takeover, and you're like, wow,
[00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:25.500]  they're really bold.
[00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:27.700]  Yeah, they've got the country under their control right now.
[00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:31.580]  They've opened the border up, they're involved in giant human trafficking, including children
[00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:36.580]  by the hundreds of thousands, many of which go into sex slavery.
[00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:40.540]  They don't do DNA testing of unaccompanied minors now, so they find them dead later,
[00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:42.180]  they know what happened to them.
[00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:43.460]  They find them alive later.
[00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:44.700]  They're covering their tracks.
[00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:46.660]  They're as bad as it gets.
[00:34:46.660 --> 00:34:54.180]  They're totally selfish, wicked villains who don't just don't care about you, they hate
[00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:55.180]  your guts.
[00:34:55.500 --> 00:35:01.660]  I hate the proverbial statement of, oh, you know, people in government, these bureaucrats
[00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:04.220]  and these globalists, they just don't care about us.
[00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:08.220]  Oh, they care about you deeply.
[00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:11.060]  They want to kill you.
[00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:15.420]  I got stacks of articles of them admitting humans are scourges.
[00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:18.779]  If we can't kill babies in the womb, we're going to poison them later, or we're going
[00:35:18.779 --> 00:35:21.300]  to at least cut their genitals off.
[00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:23.300]  I'm going to play you the clips.
[00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:31.420]  Starting about five years ago, the left started saying, including Gloria Steinem, CIA officer,
[00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:32.620]  yeah, you know what?
[00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:36.779]  You say a baby's a human, they are, and I kill those little bastards, and I enjoy chopping
[00:35:36.779 --> 00:35:39.220]  up my children.
[00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:44.180]  And Peter Nygaard says, I get women pregnant with an artificial insemination, and at least
[00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:47.500]  once a week, I suck one of my children dry.
[00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:54.779]  We take that dead baby, and I suck all its juices out, and I inject it into my veins.
[00:35:54.779 --> 00:36:01.100]  I kill my children, I suck their juice, but vampires aren't real.
[00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:06.580]  You've got to come to grips that you haven't turned yourself over to evil, so you're like,
[00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:08.220]  why do they even like this stuff?
[00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:13.820]  Once you get into evil, and you're predisposed to it, I guess genetically, culturally, there's
[00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:14.820]  no bottom, folks.
[00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:16.620]  So you're like, how evil do they get?
[00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:20.580]  Thomas Jefferson was asked, how evil can people get?
[00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:23.100]  And he said, as evil as good people let them.
[00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:26.480]  And there's letters back and forth, and they say, well, what do you mean, as evil as we
[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:27.480]  let them get?
[00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:32.220]  And he goes, well, you'll always have one generation of corruption that's pretty bad,
[00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:37.140]  but there's always a group worse that'll replace them, because evil won't constrain evil, only
[00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:38.140]  good will.
[00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:43.240]  So you're going to always basically develop a strain of evil that is so evil, you can't
[00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:46.920]  even get your mind around it, and you're just dumbfounded.
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:51.580]  You get women pregnant, and then suck your babies dry and inject it into you?
[00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:55.759]  You make bioweapons in a lab and release it, and then inject us with something that erases
[00:36:55.759 --> 00:36:58.880]  our immune system with an HIV spike protein?
[00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:01.360]  And you look at Fauci, he's like, yeah.
[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:07.480]  And if you have discernment, not just his actions, he's an evil little man.
[00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:09.520]  You wouldn't turn your back on him for a second.
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:12.800]  You wouldn't let him babysit your children.
[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:14.000]  You wouldn't do business with him.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:19.960]  I mean, you can look at him, he's a disingenuous, evil man.
[00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:24.600]  A lot of times, the book does judge the cover, or a lot of times, you do judge a book by
[00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:26.040]  its cover.
[00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:33.120]  So Trump has come out and put a statement out, and he says, when you get these, it always
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:35.279]  means they're going to indict you.
[00:37:35.279 --> 00:37:42.319]  They let you know you're the target of a grand jury, report to it within four days.
[00:37:42.319 --> 00:37:48.840]  So Trump now reports to a DC handpicked group, and it turned out in Roger Stone's trial,
[00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:54.680]  you name it, half the jury were Democratic Party operatives, and were married NSA officials
[00:37:54.680 --> 00:38:00.440]  that were Democrats, and were posting on social media how they wanted to put Trump in prison.
[00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:05.080]  Should have been a total mistrial, should have been the courts overturning Roger's conviction
[00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:09.440]  for lying to Congress, which he didn't do.
[00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:19.480]  And instead, Trump had to pardon him.
[00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:23.800]  The only thing necessary for triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.
[00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:28.680]  Edmund Burke said something similar to Thomas Jefferson.
[00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:31.800]  All that evil men and tyrants need to flourish is that good men do nothing.
[00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:37.000]  That's Thomas Jefferson, who came first, chicken or the egg.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.360]  So this is another Rubicon moment.
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:43.600]  This is another crossing the line moment, and all I can tell you is these people are
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:48.560]  incredibly dangerous, and incredibly bold, and incredibly insane.
[00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:55.200]  And I pray for President Trump, and I pray for an accelerated awakening, and I pray for
[00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:59.040]  all the enemy's plans to be confounded, and then for all their crimes to come out, which
[00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:00.720]  is happening.
[00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:02.600]  There's not this evil in the universe.
[00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:10.760]  And they have really engaged in the dark arts here, and this is not going to end well for
[00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:11.760]  anybody.
[00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:17.760]  I mean, I can tell you right now, this is a gigantic, flaming disaster on a thousand
[00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:20.200]  different fronts.
[00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:24.200]  And we'll open the phones up after Roger leaves us for the balance of the broadcast.
[00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:27.360]  He'll pop in for 30 minutes, start the next hour.
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:31.640]  And so I'll give the number out when we're at about 1206, when we come in to interview
[00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:32.640]  Roger.
[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:33.640]  I'll give the number up.
[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:34.640]  We'll get your calls all teed up.
[00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:40.920]  And we're going to talk about one subject, Republican crisis, the looming D.C. swamp
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:46.360]  indictment of President Trump, the tentacles of the swamp reaching out and grabbing him.
[00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:50.640]  When what did Trump say on January 6th, we're going to play the clip in a moment, he said
[00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:51.640]  it over and over again.
[00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:58.279]  He said, we're going to peacefully and respectfully march down to our Capitol and let them know.
[00:39:58.279 --> 00:40:05.760]  And he'd been told that we had a stage at the corner, northeast corner by the Supreme
[00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:08.279]  Court on the Capitol grounds.
[00:40:08.279 --> 00:40:09.800]  And there was a stage set up there.
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:13.319]  And we just figured, well, the Secret Service would be there and the police would be there.
[00:40:13.319 --> 00:40:17.960]  And we showed up and there were like 50 police at the Capitol being attacked by a couple
[00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:20.520]  thousand people led by ramps.
[00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:24.520]  And it turns out the D.C. police were involved in attacking the Capitol police that's come
[00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:27.160]  out in Congress.
[00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:28.160]  And tear gas and everything.
[00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:29.720]  And they'd already got into the Capitol.
[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:31.040]  And I said, you better get out of there.
[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:32.600]  It's going to be Kent State.
[00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:36.440]  And it was Kent State.
[00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:40.240]  Ashley Babbitt and four other citizens got killed.
[00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:41.240]  But the truth didn't matter.
[00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:43.040]  They said five cops got killed that day.
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:46.279]  No cops got killed.
[00:40:46.279 --> 00:40:50.800]  And then they said by guilt by association, the million people stretched out from the
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:56.000]  Capitol down to the Ellipse, that million plus people stretched out for miles.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:59.360]  You were all guilty.
[00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:03.600]  And the NSA and private companies, data mine, whoever was in D.C. and people that were there
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:05.600]  for a wedding, people that were there for business.
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:09.960]  They got raided by the police because you're all part of an insurrection.
[00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:15.560]  You were all there with Trump ordering you to attack.
[00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:21.760]  Here's Trump saying at his political rally that he set up, now let's peacefully march
[00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:22.760]  to the Capitol.
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:27.080]  And the globalists saw that weak point and the Secret Service stood down.
[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:28.160]  Trump's like, I'm going to my rally.
[00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:29.160]  I'm going to my speech.
[00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:30.160]  No, sir.
[00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:31.160]  You're not.
[00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:32.160]  The Capitol's been attacked.
[00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:35.360]  But the thing was, the Secret Service knew he was going.
[00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:38.380]  They knew it was all set up weeks before.
[00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:39.380]  They knew.
[00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:44.480]  But they withdrew the bureaucracy where I was counting on them.
[00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:45.560]  Trump was counting on them.
[00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:46.560]  And they did that.
[00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:52.120]  I'm not saying the rank and file Secret Service are involved, but we know the rest of the
[00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:53.120]  country.
[00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:54.120]  We were set up.
[00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:58.880]  And now they've got big enough balls in the rigged D.C. court to indict him for the federal
[00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:01.360]  false flag operation they ran on January 6th.
[00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:02.360]  Here's a clip of Trump.
[00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:09.360]  Come to demand that Congress do the right thing and only count the electors who have been
[00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:14.319]  lawfully slated, lawfully slated.
[00:42:14.319 --> 00:42:19.560]  I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully
[00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:23.319]  and patriotically make your voices heard.
[00:42:23.319 --> 00:42:31.000]  Today, we will see whether Republicans stand strong for integrity of our elections, but
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.720]  whether or not they stand strong for our country.
[00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:36.000]  I'm going to go to break.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:42.640]  I'm going to come back and give me a little prelude to the other news we'll cover after
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:43.640]  Roger Stone leaves us.
[00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:44.640]  We take your calls.
[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:45.640]  And it's crazy.
[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:46.640]  It's it's wild.
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:47.640]  It's it's amazing.
[00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:48.640]  It's important.
[00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:49.720]  You're not tuned in to the real world.
[00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:52.720]  You're not tuned in to fantasy world, Netflix or HBO.
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:53.720]  You're tuned to the real world.
[00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:54.720]  Earth 2023.
[00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:55.720]  Stay with us.
[00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:56.720]  The globalists are only humans.
[00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:57.720]  Yeah, they have control of the central banks.
[00:42:57.720 --> 00:42:58.720]  They have a lot of power.
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:42:59.720]  But they can be defeated.
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:00.720]  But some of their operations are going to take decades to stop.
[00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:01.720]  But one thing you can do right now is take control of your body and your family's body
[00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:02.720]  by purifying the water that you drink and that you cook with.
[00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:03.720]  And you do it with the highest quality.
[00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:04.720]  And you do it with the highest quality.
[00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:05.720]  And you do it with the highest quality.
[00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:06.720]  And you do it with the highest quality.
[00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:07.720]  And you do it with the highest quality.
[00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:08.720]  And you do it with the highest quality.
[00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:09.720]  And you do it with the highest quality.
[00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:10.720]  And you do it with the highest quality.
[00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:11.720]  And you do it with the highest quality.
[00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:12.720]  And you do it with the highest quality.
[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:13.720]  And you do it with the highest quality.
[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:14.720]  And you do it with the highest quality.
[00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:15.720]  And you do it with the highest quality.
[00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:16.720]  And you do it with the highest quality.
[00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:17.720]  And you do it with the highest quality.
[00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:18.720]  And you do it with the highest quality.
[00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:19.720]  And you do it with the highest quality.
[00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:20.720]  And you do it with the highest quality.
[00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:21.720]  And you do it with the highest quality.
[00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:22.720]  And you do it with the highest quality.
[00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:23.720]  And you do it with the highest quality.
[00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:24.720]  And you do it with the highest quality.
[00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:25.720]  And you do it with the highest quality.
[00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:26.720]  And you do it with the highest quality.
[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:27.720]  And you do it with the highest quality.
[00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:28.720]  And you do it with the highest quality.
[00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:29.720]  And you do it with the highest quality.
[00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:59.440]  And you do it with the highest quality.
[00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:05.720]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into
[00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:06.840]  the atmosphere.
[00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:09.640]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:16.000]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers to convert these gases
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.160]  into fluorosilicic acid.
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:20.440]  Still highly toxic, but containable.
[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:23.800]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison.
[00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:26.279]  And there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[00:44:26.279 --> 00:44:31.200]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the Secretary of the Treasury, who
[00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:34.720]  was responsible for the public health service at the time.
[00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:41.240]  And by 1950, the U.S. government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste product
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:43.640]  and dumping it into our drinking water.
[00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:48.880]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:52.560]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water.
[00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:55.279]  And a remedy to this madness.
[00:44:55.279 --> 00:44:59.440]  Available now at infowarestore.com.
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:04.920]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on earth.
[00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:07.640]  And they've got our children drinking that.
[00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:13.360]  This is a psychotic death cult, period, case closed, out to get you and your family.
[00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:18.360]  We sell the Alexa Pure Breeze, made by the My Patriot Supply Ready Hour Group, that's
[00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:21.640]  been around about 15 years, became the biggest company in the last six.
[00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:26.000]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered the fancy, best water filter system out there
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:31.200]  that sells for twice the price, and they made it as good in all the studies.
[00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:34.440]  It reduces things to non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals.
[00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:37.560]  But you can go pay two or three times, there's four or five other filters out there that
[00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:38.760]  are just as good.
[00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:43.000]  We sell the very best, highest grade water filtration system for half the price of the
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:44.000]  leading competitor.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:49.400]  And the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should filter your water.
[00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:51.160]  You should also filter your shower water.
[00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:54.200]  It's another way you absorb this crap, but I'm done talking about that.
[00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:58.279]  The point is, you can get the filters at MFullWorthStore.com, they're discounted right now, finally back
[00:45:58.279 --> 00:45:59.279]  in stock.
[00:45:59.279 --> 00:46:04.360]  A lot of people have asked me, why is MFullWorthStore and MFullWorth's life not at a probiotic for
[00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:05.360]  more than three years?

[00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:17.920]  They got bought by a lip-tard company and said, we're not doing business with you, Mr.
[00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:19.480]  Jones, anymore.
[00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:25.440]  Finally, we got a probiotic just as good or better with a top lab that loves our show.

[00:46:58.770 --> 00:47:08.770]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:09.410 --> 00:47:38.770]  Alright, let me tell you what's coming up here in the next three hours plus.
[00:47:39.730 --> 00:47:43.970]  Roger Stone obviously responding to Trump getting the word he'll be indicted
[00:47:43.970 --> 00:47:50.170]  tomorrow, the next day, by next week he believes. Got a statement right here for
[00:47:50.170 --> 00:47:54.970]  attacking the Capitol and questioning the election. And if they can take down a
[00:47:54.970 --> 00:47:59.569]  popular US president who's 30, 40, 50 points, 70 points ahead of the Republicans,
[00:47:59.569 --> 00:48:04.370]  they can do anything. I mean that takes a lot of chutzpah, a lot of balls, a lot of
[00:48:04.370 --> 00:48:12.290]  bravado. But you know what goes before a fall? Pride. Then we've got massive Sound
[00:48:12.290 --> 00:48:18.009]  of Freedom news with an admitted pedo-apologist that promotes pedophilia
[00:48:18.009 --> 00:48:23.770]  for Bloomberg and Rolling Stone and other publications that defends them
[00:48:23.770 --> 00:48:29.170]  attacking the movie. It's like, wow, it's like, it's just ridiculous. These people are
[00:48:29.170 --> 00:48:34.930]  crazy. But they believe they have all the power so they're full of bravado. They're full of
[00:48:34.930 --> 00:48:40.569]  hubris is really the word. You say chutzpah, bravado, it's hubris. But let's put the
[00:48:40.569 --> 00:48:46.730]  definition of hubris up on screen if you can. We have incredible pedo-news and
[00:48:46.730 --> 00:48:53.330]  incredible globalist sex cult mutilating children news from Admiral Levin and the
[00:48:53.330 --> 00:48:58.649]  rest of the freaks. YouTube officially replaces the American flag emoji with
[00:48:58.649 --> 00:49:02.890]  the trans flag so you can't even find the American flag. It's about taking our
[00:49:02.890 --> 00:49:05.890]  flag down and putting their pedo flag up.
[00:49:05.890 --> 00:49:13.170]  Zelensky Pentagon acknowledges counter offensive had to be paused and that it's
[00:49:13.170 --> 00:49:20.330]  been smashed. We've got mainstream news just lying about the heat wave. Bright
[00:49:20.330 --> 00:49:26.970]  red weather map and fake temperature records drive climate panic. We have a
[00:49:26.970 --> 00:49:33.009]  lot of Fauci news. As it turns out, he's got illegal presidential level protection
[00:49:33.009 --> 00:49:37.970]  and the federal marshals got caught lying saying the feds weren't paying. This is a
[00:49:37.970 --> 00:49:44.370]  felony. The federal government's illegally paying for a retired federal
[00:49:44.370 --> 00:49:48.529]  employee to have an entire security detail. It's like Al Capone. They didn't get him for
[00:49:48.529 --> 00:49:52.890]  running murder operations and money laundering and all, but they got him on
[00:49:52.890 --> 00:49:58.690]  income tax. So again, Fauci's a little royal princeling in all this. He's got
[00:49:58.690 --> 00:50:05.810]  hundreds of millions of dollars he stole with all the scams. The guy's super rich, but why
[00:50:05.810 --> 00:50:10.290]  then does he get a full federal marshal detail? Not to mention all the other
[00:50:10.290 --> 00:50:16.049]  crimes he's committed. That's coming out. But let's get into this right now. Tucker
[00:50:16.049 --> 00:50:22.490]  Carlson over the weekend talked to the globalist Trojan horse, fake Christian,
[00:50:22.490 --> 00:50:29.170]  fake conservative, in my view, Mike Pence, and said, Hey, our cities are collapsing,
[00:50:29.170 --> 00:50:33.930]  record suicide, homeless everywhere. And he said, I don't care. I'm not worried about
[00:50:33.930 --> 00:50:42.850]  that. That's not even on my mind. Because war with Russia is number one. It's like
[00:50:42.850 --> 00:50:46.930]  Pence is under mind control or something. When you watch the full 30 minute interview. I
[00:50:46.930 --> 00:50:54.129]  mean, Pence is just collapsing. And he says, that's none of my concern, America. So our
[00:50:54.129 --> 00:50:58.049]  crew put together a little joke video that will actually show you the real raw videos.
[00:50:58.049 --> 00:51:04.089]  This little accusers of disinfo. That creature that looked like Zelensky and Pence was not
[00:51:04.089 --> 00:51:09.490]  really Zelensky or Pence. Infowars used a morphing program and deepfake to put them
[00:51:09.490 --> 00:51:14.049]  out. Yes, it's called a joke, a meme. So whenever we show a meme or a joke, now we then show
[00:51:14.049 --> 00:51:18.490]  the raw footage after of what actually happened. And of course, you know, it's a meme. You
[00:51:18.490 --> 00:51:23.049]  know, it's a joke. They know it's a joke. It's how they play their games. They're the
[00:51:23.049 --> 00:51:29.330]  ones that put out lies. You'll read mainstream articles. No, no quote, no link. No, no video
[00:51:29.330 --> 00:51:34.130]  clip almost because they're lying to you. When we say something, when I say Trump said
[00:51:34.130 --> 00:51:41.370]  be peaceful and go to our Capitol, we show you the clip. When CNN says Trump said all
[00:51:41.370 --> 00:51:44.730]  Hispanics are criminals and bad people. We're like, where's the clip? Didn't say anything
[00:51:44.730 --> 00:51:49.730]  close to that. Said a lot of great people coming across the border, but a lot of bad
[00:51:49.730 --> 00:51:54.210]  people are coming across illegally. Rapists, murderers, child traffickers. It's all true.
[00:51:54.210 --> 00:52:01.250]  Who denies that? So again, remember how many times they've lied to you and never let them
[00:52:01.250 --> 00:52:07.970]  condition you to accept their lies and just take their lies. So here's a little piece
[00:52:07.970 --> 00:52:10.970]  we put together. Tucker told me last night he really liked it. Here it is.
[00:52:10.970 --> 00:52:16.930]  Our economy has degraded. The suicide rate has jumped. Public filth and disorder and crime
[00:52:16.930 --> 00:52:23.730]  have exponentially increased. And yet your concern is that the Ukrainians, a country
[00:52:23.730 --> 00:52:28.770]  most people can't find on a map, who've received tens of billions of U.S. tax dollars, don't
[00:52:28.770 --> 00:52:32.810]  have enough tanks. I think it's a fair question to ask, like, where's the concern for the
[00:52:32.810 --> 00:52:33.810]  United States in that?
[00:52:33.850 --> 00:52:35.009]  Well, it's not my concern.
[00:52:36.730 --> 00:52:39.649]  That's called World War Three.
[00:52:41.170 --> 00:52:45.370]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:52:51.649 --> 00:52:57.649]  Every city in the United States has become much worse over the past three years. Drive
[00:52:57.649 --> 00:53:02.569]  around. There's not one city that's gotten better in the United States and it's visible.
[00:53:02.730 --> 00:53:08.130]  Our economy has degraded. The suicide rate has jumped. Public filth and disorder and
[00:53:08.130 --> 00:53:15.609]  crime have exponentially increased. And yet your concern is that the Ukrainians, a country
[00:53:15.609 --> 00:53:20.649]  most people can't find on a map, who've received tens of billions of U.S. tax dollars, don't
[00:53:20.649 --> 00:53:24.689]  have enough tanks. I think it's a fair question to ask, like, where's the concern for the
[00:53:24.689 --> 00:53:25.689]  United States in that?
[00:53:25.689 --> 00:53:26.890]  Well, it's not my concern.
[00:53:28.649 --> 00:53:32.009]  Tucker, I've heard that routine from you before, but that's not my concern.
[00:53:32.730 --> 00:53:34.089]  No, no, no, no.
[00:53:35.049 --> 00:53:39.370]  But if I could make some general observations, which I think are more edifying than just
[00:53:39.370 --> 00:53:43.730]  like savaging Mike Pence, I think.
[00:53:46.529 --> 00:53:52.689]  Which I'm not going to do because that would be wrong and it would be wrong because it's
[00:53:52.689 --> 00:53:55.609]  too easy and the easy things are not rewarding, are they?
[00:53:55.609 --> 00:53:59.529]  You don't feel good when you beat your five year old in soccer or ping pong.
[00:53:59.529 --> 00:54:00.130]  Like what?
[00:54:03.170 --> 00:54:06.970]  Yeah, that's ending Mike Pence's career, which he already did being a traitor.
[00:54:07.770 --> 00:54:10.970]  He just puts on that good old boy Johnny Quest dad act.
[00:54:10.970 --> 00:54:13.569]  He does. The guy is a complete fraud.
[00:54:16.450 --> 00:54:20.890]  In fact, just looking at him, I bet his basement's got some wild stuff in Indiana, probably
[00:54:20.890 --> 00:54:21.930]  a big ass pentagram.
[00:54:21.930 --> 00:54:22.689]  I'm serious.
[00:54:23.970 --> 00:54:25.130]  He trips to Epstein Island.
[00:54:25.130 --> 00:54:30.049]  How compromised are you that America collapsing, mass suicide, total crime in the
[00:54:30.049 --> 00:54:32.009]  streets, none of your concern?
[00:54:33.569 --> 00:54:37.370]  He's heard your routine, Tucker, caring about the country and what the two hundred
[00:54:37.370 --> 00:54:39.290]  billion sent to Ukraine could have done for this nation.
[00:54:39.730 --> 00:54:42.330]  It's not a routine, Pence.
[00:54:42.850 --> 00:54:45.049]  It's called our country going to hell, son.
[00:54:45.569 --> 00:54:47.810]  And you elitist up there playing God.
[00:54:49.330 --> 00:54:50.649]  And you are an elite maggot.
[00:54:51.250 --> 00:54:51.770]  All right.
[00:54:52.089 --> 00:54:56.770]  Speaking of action, the action conference Tucker was at, I need action from you.
[00:54:56.970 --> 00:55:01.290]  The number one thing I'm asking for is prayer for this broadcast and that people be
[00:55:01.370 --> 00:55:02.569]  brought to it and have a sermon.
[00:55:02.970 --> 00:55:06.689]  The number two thing is that you bring people by sending them saying, hey, you've heard
[00:55:06.689 --> 00:55:08.130]  it's demonized. You've heard it's attacked.
[00:55:08.290 --> 00:55:10.410]  Let's just tell the truth. Go to Infowars dot com.
[00:55:10.609 --> 00:55:12.290]  Tell them in your email. Tell them verbally.
[00:55:12.450 --> 00:55:15.730]  Tell them by text message. Realize the enemy's fighting around the clock to stop that.
[00:55:15.930 --> 00:55:20.450]  There's even censorship in Google Mail and in WhatsApp on text messages trying to
[00:55:20.450 --> 00:55:22.130]  block people promoting Infowars.
[00:55:22.370 --> 00:55:26.009]  That's because the enemy sees it as the cure to their disease.
[00:55:26.170 --> 00:55:29.250]  So let's share it. Share Infowars dot com.
[00:55:29.649 --> 00:55:31.049]  Share Bandai video.
[00:55:31.049 --> 00:55:32.290]  Share News Wars dot com.
[00:55:32.290 --> 00:55:35.210]  A backup site. You ever see Infowars down occasionally under attack?
[00:55:35.250 --> 00:55:37.810]  News Wars will be up. Hopefully Bandai video.
[00:55:37.810 --> 00:55:39.250]  Sometimes you can't share that URL.
[00:55:39.330 --> 00:55:40.649]  Mad Max World TV.
[00:55:40.649 --> 00:55:41.970]  They haven't blocked that URL yet.
[00:55:42.370 --> 00:55:47.009]  But whatever you do, continue to realize we're in an Infowars war up against AI, up
[00:55:47.009 --> 00:55:50.569]  against globalists. But when you get excited and you decide to spread the word, nothing
[00:55:50.569 --> 00:55:55.410]  can stop you. And then separately, we have been right in the red, right in the black.
[00:55:55.410 --> 00:56:00.689]  We are now into the black and I want to go major into the black so that we can get out
[00:56:00.689 --> 00:56:04.370]  of this bankruptcy organization and then say, OK, we're going to hire more reporters.
[00:56:04.370 --> 00:56:05.810]  We're going to expand.
[00:56:07.290 --> 00:56:10.410]  And I'm making those arguments right now about to make them to the bankruptcy court in
[00:56:10.410 --> 00:56:15.089]  like a month. Looks like it's going to go through, we're going to stay on air, but I
[00:56:15.089 --> 00:56:19.009]  don't want to just sit here and have some court deal where we just operate and crawl
[00:56:19.009 --> 00:56:24.130]  along. I want to supercharge and I want to expand and build this operation.
[00:56:25.130 --> 00:56:27.450]  That takes funds, plus that's a side issue.
[00:56:28.410 --> 00:56:29.609]  These are great products.
[00:56:29.609 --> 00:56:32.649]  Our nitric mist is incredible.
[00:56:32.649 --> 00:56:34.930]  Cleans out your blood. Highest quality for Dr.
[00:56:34.930 --> 00:56:36.089]  Mick of it. Say how amazing it is.
[00:56:36.290 --> 00:56:40.210]  It's discounted double Patriot points right now, up to 60 percent off on products and
[00:56:40.210 --> 00:56:42.049]  infowars.com. And then this final point.
[00:56:43.529 --> 00:56:45.250]  It's been three years since we had it.
[00:56:46.210 --> 00:56:50.730]  We got it back in stock, the amazing 30 parts per million, highest quality colloidal
[00:56:50.730 --> 00:56:54.330]  silver and all the great things and all the great uses back in stock.
[00:56:54.330 --> 00:56:55.410]  Limited supply.

[00:56:59.250 --> 00:57:04.049]  And it's a very limited supply, but we have it back.

[00:57:09.529 --> 00:57:11.370]  colloidal silver has returned.

[00:57:21.770 --> 00:57:25.730]  product that has applications for both preparedness and regular use.
[00:57:26.130 --> 00:57:27.210]  It is amazing.

[00:57:30.450 --> 00:57:36.529]  Infowarsstore.com silver bullet returns to Infowarsstore.com.
[00:57:36.890 --> 00:57:41.130]  And while you're there, get some super female vitality, some turbo force, some
[00:57:41.130 --> 00:57:44.770]  brain force and some brain force ultra because they're all about to sell out.
[00:57:44.930 --> 00:57:46.810]  And krill oil is amazing as well.
[00:57:49.529 --> 00:57:54.009]  With all the craziness in the world, the collapsing borders, the war with Russia,
[00:57:54.609 --> 00:58:00.089]  the insanity, the currency devaluations, the economy going crazy, you are crazy in
[00:58:00.089 --> 00:58:03.850]  my view, if you don't get high quality, storable food and water filtration and
[00:58:03.850 --> 00:58:04.649]  self-defense.
[00:58:04.890 --> 00:58:06.490]  Now, we're not selling guns and ammo.
[00:58:06.569 --> 00:58:08.770]  That's for you to go out and get for yourself and learn how to use if you
[00:58:08.770 --> 00:58:10.890]  haven't. And I preach to the choir on that.
[00:58:11.210 --> 00:58:14.770]  But a lot of people got plenty of guns, but they don't have enough storable food
[00:58:14.970 --> 00:58:15.850]  or water filtration.
[00:58:16.130 --> 00:58:17.890]  This is something you need now.
[00:58:17.890 --> 00:58:21.649]  And we've got it in the food department and in the high quality water filtration
[00:58:21.649 --> 00:58:25.450]  department, the highest quality food, the best water filtration at the lowest

[00:58:40.930 --> 00:58:42.850]  It's an insane deal for a limited time.
[00:58:42.970 --> 00:58:47.009]  Go to Infowarsstore.com and get prepared while you still can.
[00:58:50.649 --> 00:58:53.810]  I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had.
[00:58:54.130 --> 00:58:55.370]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[00:58:56.049 --> 00:58:59.330]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[00:59:00.049 --> 00:59:02.930]  When we talk about the crew at Infowars, people behind the scenes, the
[00:59:02.930 --> 00:59:08.130]  researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[00:59:08.890 --> 00:59:11.930]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they
[00:59:11.930 --> 00:59:16.810]  engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[00:59:17.689 --> 00:59:20.689]  So for myself, the whole Infowars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[00:59:21.370 --> 00:59:25.450]  I only encourage you now to realize that Infowars cannot stay on air
[00:59:25.450 --> 00:59:26.490]  if you do not support us.
[00:59:27.170 --> 00:59:28.130]  I know you spread the word.
[00:59:28.130 --> 00:59:29.609]  I know you pray for us and that's wonderful.
[00:59:29.609 --> 00:59:30.170]  Keep doing it.
[00:59:30.170 --> 00:59:35.009]  But most viewers and listeners never go to Infowarsstore.com and you never buy
[00:59:35.009 --> 00:59:37.930]  great products that enrich and empower your life while at the same time,
[00:59:37.930 --> 00:59:38.569]  keep us on air.
[00:59:39.130 --> 00:59:42.850]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:59:43.410 --> 00:59:46.649]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to Infowarsstore.com,
[00:59:46.970 --> 00:59:48.170]  our funding problems will be over.
[00:59:48.370 --> 00:59:49.290]  Please take action now.
[00:59:51.410 --> 00:59:55.689]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order.
[00:59:56.009 --> 00:59:57.649]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:07.930 --> 01:00:14.930]  Rising up, straight to the top, every gun's got the glory.
[01:00:16.649 --> 01:00:23.649]  Went the distance, now I'm not gonna stop, just a man and his will to survive.
[01:00:24.089 --> 01:00:28.290]  It's a deep eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight.
[01:00:28.290 --> 01:00:31.770]  Rising up to the challenge of our lives.
[01:00:31.770 --> 01:00:37.049]  Let Congress do the right thing and only count the electors
[01:00:37.049 --> 01:00:41.130]  who have been lawfully slated, lawfully slated.
[01:00:42.450 --> 01:00:46.370]  I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building
[01:00:47.089 --> 01:00:51.450]  to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.
[01:00:51.490 --> 01:00:58.250]  Today we will see whether Republicans stand strong for integrity of our
[01:00:58.250 --> 01:01:01.730]  elections, but whether or not they stand strong for our country.
[01:01:03.689 --> 01:01:06.130]  We need to peacefully march to the Capitol.
[01:01:06.450 --> 01:01:08.609]  Roger Stone, some stations don't carry this first five.
[01:01:08.609 --> 01:01:09.569]  We'll recap next segment.
[01:01:09.569 --> 01:01:10.930]  I don't want to waste your time here today.
[01:01:11.370 --> 01:01:14.850]  You told me months ago, you believe Jack Smith would indict him.
[01:01:14.850 --> 01:01:18.009]  You said it on air, but probably you said you believe the most important
[01:01:18.009 --> 01:01:21.890]  indictment will be January 6th out of DC because it's such a controlled
[01:01:22.529 --> 01:01:25.529]  jurisdiction as you were railroaded through there and countless
[01:01:25.529 --> 01:01:26.609]  others have been as well.
[01:01:27.009 --> 01:01:30.130]  And now Trump has come out and said from his lawyers, his analysis,
[01:01:30.130 --> 01:01:32.370]  he will be indicted very soon.
[01:01:32.370 --> 01:01:34.170]  Report to the grand jury within four days.
[01:01:34.649 --> 01:01:38.210]  All I got to say is, ma'am, this is the jumping the shark of jumping the sharks.
[01:01:38.210 --> 01:01:39.890]  This is so insane.
[01:01:41.529 --> 01:01:43.529]  Well, Alex, I don't want to speculate.
[01:01:43.529 --> 01:01:48.850]  We obviously don't know whether they are seeking to charge the former
[01:01:48.850 --> 01:01:54.250]  president regarding the riot at the Capitol, although that would seem to
[01:01:54.250 --> 01:01:58.330]  me based on what I've read to be outside the scope of Mr.
[01:01:58.330 --> 01:01:59.770]  Smith's investigation.
[01:02:00.049 --> 01:02:03.410]  And that's generally speaking, being prosecuted by others or
[01:02:03.410 --> 01:02:08.569]  whether it is a challenge to the electors in certain states.
[01:02:09.009 --> 01:02:14.330]  Very famously, John Kennedy filed a slate of alternative electors in
[01:02:14.330 --> 01:02:19.890]  Hawaii in 1960, when there was a dispute about the outcome and that
[01:02:19.890 --> 01:02:25.649]  state that was of course not considered to be unconstitutional or
[01:02:25.649 --> 01:02:27.130]  illegal or treasonous.
[01:02:27.370 --> 01:02:31.210]  So there is some precedent for that, but we don't really know enough
[01:02:31.250 --> 01:02:37.850]  about what they intend to try to bring against the president, other than
[01:02:37.850 --> 01:02:40.330]  to say it really is unprecedented.
[01:02:40.330 --> 01:02:42.770]  He is a candidate for the white house.
[01:02:42.850 --> 01:02:44.250]  He is leading Joe Biden.
[01:02:44.290 --> 01:02:46.250]  That is what's got them petrified.
[01:02:46.490 --> 01:02:52.210]  Their Biden is snared up in an extortion, money laundering, influence
[01:02:52.210 --> 01:03:00.450]  peddling, illegal lobbying, treasonous scandal for which there's far more
[01:03:00.450 --> 01:03:04.649]  hard evidence than there ever was put forward regarding President
[01:03:04.649 --> 01:03:07.330]  Trump in the two phony impeachments.
[01:03:07.569 --> 01:03:09.210]  So what do they do?
[01:03:09.210 --> 01:03:13.649]  They go out and they seek to remove Donald Trump from the equation.
[01:03:14.370 --> 01:03:20.770]  It is only a conviction, Alex, for a violation of the constitution
[01:03:20.890 --> 01:03:25.970]  pertaining to insurrection that would make him ineligible to be a candidate.
[01:03:26.370 --> 01:03:31.009]  And as long as he is legally eligible to be a candidate, he
[01:03:31.009 --> 01:03:32.529]  will never give up the fight.
[01:03:32.930 --> 01:03:38.529]  So perhaps, perhaps that is the game plan here to try to take him out of
[01:03:38.529 --> 01:03:44.370]  contention because they already know they cannot beat him in a free, fair,
[01:03:44.450 --> 01:03:46.609]  honest, transparent election.
[01:03:46.930 --> 01:03:48.330]  Well, what you just said is huge.
[01:03:48.330 --> 01:03:51.210]  I just think you said we can't speculate, but I don't think there's any speculation.
[01:03:51.529 --> 01:03:56.569]  None of their other kangaroo charges, alternate electors, which the Democrats
[01:03:56.569 --> 01:04:01.170]  called for just a few elections ago, Kennedy used it, it's all there.
[01:04:01.370 --> 01:04:03.130]  Trump went with standard stuff.
[01:04:03.609 --> 01:04:04.770]  They think the public's dumb.
[01:04:05.529 --> 01:04:09.450]  Obviously they want the insurrection clause so they can preclude him.
[01:04:09.730 --> 01:04:13.850]  The question is, can they indict him, have a kangaroo trial quick enough to
[01:04:13.850 --> 01:04:17.689]  then claim that he's precluded before he wins in a landslide, that's
[01:04:17.689 --> 01:04:20.529]  the $64 quadrillion question.
[01:04:21.450 --> 01:04:24.490]  We're going to cover that when we come back in detail.
[01:04:24.689 --> 01:04:26.490]  What else are you going to be breaking down?
[01:04:27.850 --> 01:04:32.130]  Well, Alex, it is a, I must tell you, the president is absolutely
[01:04:32.130 --> 01:04:33.330]  at the top of his game.
[01:04:33.330 --> 01:04:37.609]  I was with him in Palm beach on a Saturday and Sunday.
[01:04:38.090 --> 01:04:42.009]  Uh, I've never seen him, uh, in this, in this fighting mode.
[01:04:42.009 --> 01:04:45.210]  I mean, he's, he's given everything on his shoulders.
[01:04:45.210 --> 01:04:48.609]  He's relaxed, he's determined, he's confident.
[01:04:48.649 --> 01:04:52.890]  Uh, he is, uh, he's really at his best under crisis.
[01:04:52.890 --> 01:04:57.490]  He's at his best when under fire, he really is a warrior, a lesser
[01:04:57.490 --> 01:04:59.609]  man would have thrown in there.
[01:04:59.970 --> 01:05:03.490]  The globalists aren't just targeting us through the poison shots or the
[01:05:03.529 --> 01:05:06.050]  electromagnetic five G or the GMO crops.
[01:05:06.370 --> 01:05:10.769]  They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals that the EPA has authorized
[01:05:10.769 --> 01:05:12.170]  companies and industry to use.
[01:05:12.729 --> 01:05:17.490]  One of the top pesticides used is atrazine, the allowable level, the
[01:05:17.569 --> 01:05:20.490]  government admits that they allow to be in your water supply is enough
[01:05:20.490 --> 01:05:25.009]  to sterilize you and basically turn your son into a feminized mutant.
[01:05:25.330 --> 01:05:25.970]  Look it up.
[01:05:26.450 --> 01:05:27.850]  Don't let them do this to your family.
[01:05:27.850 --> 01:05:31.490]  We have the very best gravity fed filter system out there, highest
[01:05:31.490 --> 01:05:35.050]  rated at half the price of leading competitors, the Alexa pure

[01:05:40.689 --> 01:05:41.529]  It is amazing.
[01:05:41.689 --> 01:05:43.410]  It's great for your home, your business.
[01:05:43.410 --> 01:05:44.569]  You can put swamp water in it.
[01:05:44.689 --> 01:05:45.810]  Tap water, whatever.
[01:05:45.850 --> 01:05:47.769]  Well, water, almost everything's contaminated.
[01:05:47.970 --> 01:05:50.649]  This is how you take control of the fluids in your body and
[01:05:50.649 --> 01:05:51.810]  counter the globalist onslaught.

[01:05:57.410 --> 01:05:58.290]  The lowest price out there.
[01:05:58.370 --> 01:05:59.170]  You need this filter.
[01:06:00.890 --> 01:06:01.490]  On the line.
[01:06:01.490 --> 01:06:02.490]  We are in trouble.
[01:06:02.529 --> 01:06:03.810]  This country is in trouble.
[01:06:05.090 --> 01:06:08.850]  The election will decide whether your generation inherits a fair
[01:06:10.250 --> 01:06:14.330]  free country, whether you will have a rule of tyrants or the
[01:06:14.330 --> 01:06:18.689]  rule of law, whether Marxist radicals burn our civilization
[01:06:18.689 --> 01:06:21.649]  to the ground, which they're looking to do, or young
[01:06:21.649 --> 01:06:24.970]  patriots like you propel America to glorious new heights
[01:06:24.970 --> 01:06:26.290]  greater than ever before.
[01:06:26.850 --> 01:06:30.009]  Side by side, we're going to fight and we're going to win.
[01:06:30.090 --> 01:06:31.450]  We have no choice, sexually.
[01:06:37.609 --> 01:06:41.210]  We're going to evict crooked Joe Biden.
[01:06:41.210 --> 01:06:42.930]  You know, I took the name off of Hillary.
[01:06:43.569 --> 01:06:44.290]  You know that, right?
[01:06:44.290 --> 01:06:46.009]  Everybody here knows that it was crooked.
[01:06:46.009 --> 01:06:46.370]  Hillary.
[01:06:46.370 --> 01:06:52.050]  I was very successful, but I think she's out of it now, but
[01:06:52.050 --> 01:06:55.729]  no, I thought it was more appropriate because he's crooked.
[01:06:56.370 --> 01:06:59.970]  As you can get, this is the most dishonest president in history.
[01:07:00.410 --> 01:07:01.410]  And I wouldn't have said it.
[01:07:01.410 --> 01:07:05.009]  You know, I have, I have pride in the presidency and respect
[01:07:05.009 --> 01:07:05.850]  for the presidency.
[01:07:05.850 --> 01:07:08.890]  I wouldn't have said it, but I say things about him over the
[01:07:08.890 --> 01:07:11.569]  last three weeks that I would have never said before about any
[01:07:11.569 --> 01:07:12.170]  president.
[01:07:13.170 --> 01:07:17.330]  He is a corrupt, horrible, incompetent man, and he's
[01:07:17.330 --> 01:07:18.529]  destroying our country.
[01:07:18.529 --> 01:07:24.009]  And we have to have it changed with God's help.
[01:07:24.050 --> 01:07:27.769]  We're going to save America on November 5th, 2024.
[01:07:27.769 --> 01:07:31.649]  And when I said originally in 2016, it's the most important
[01:07:31.649 --> 01:07:32.050]  election.
[01:07:32.050 --> 01:07:33.850]  I meant that this is far more important.
[01:07:33.970 --> 01:07:37.410]  This is far more important because our country is ready to
[01:07:37.410 --> 01:07:41.330]  go down, ready to go possibly into world war three.
[01:07:41.330 --> 01:07:42.970]  And this won't be a war like others.
[01:07:42.970 --> 01:07:44.450]  This will be a nuclear war.
[01:07:44.450 --> 01:07:47.729]  And the level of destruction, it's called obliteration.
[01:07:48.009 --> 01:07:51.210]  It's not two army tanks going back and forth shooting at each
[01:07:51.210 --> 01:07:52.930]  other. This is big stuff.
[01:07:52.930 --> 01:07:55.609]  And we have a man who's grossly incompetent, who doesn't even
[01:07:55.609 --> 01:07:58.450]  know where he is, who can't put two sentences.
[01:07:58.450 --> 01:07:59.810]  This is not HBO.
[01:07:59.810 --> 01:08:01.050]  This is not Netflix.
[01:08:01.050 --> 01:08:02.569]  This is the real world.
[01:08:03.009 --> 01:08:06.410]  July 2023, edge of nuclear war.
[01:08:07.170 --> 01:08:10.529]  A psychotic drug addict, pedophile and his son running the
[01:08:10.529 --> 01:08:15.970]  country under control, a literal lunatic U.N.
[01:08:16.210 --> 01:08:21.010]  prosecutor, Jack Smith, preparing to indict Trump.
[01:08:21.010 --> 01:08:23.690]  Trump's put out a letter saying when they send you this letter,
[01:08:23.690 --> 01:08:26.370]  you're a target. It almost always means you're being indicted.
[01:08:26.370 --> 01:08:29.530]  He says his indictment is imminent, told to report within four
[01:08:29.530 --> 01:08:33.690]  days to the puppet grand jury in the rigged system of D.C.
[01:08:34.370 --> 01:08:39.330]  This is just so wild, incredibly dangerous.
[01:08:39.370 --> 01:08:42.690]  And Roger Stone joins us, who just spent two days with the
[01:08:42.690 --> 01:08:47.330]  president and was just saying earlier, if a station just
[01:08:47.330 --> 01:08:50.570]  joined us, that Trump is energized like never before.
[01:08:50.570 --> 01:08:51.650]  Well, you can see it in these clips.
[01:08:51.650 --> 01:08:55.210]  But elaborate on that and how big a constitutional crisis this
[01:08:55.210 --> 01:08:57.490]  is. I mean, this is this is election meddling.
[01:08:57.610 --> 01:09:00.930]  Imagine a Republican, unpopular president.
[01:09:00.930 --> 01:09:03.650]  And then a Democrat was 30 points ahead of him in polls.
[01:09:03.969 --> 01:09:06.610]  And then the Republicans were indicting the Democrat.
[01:09:06.769 --> 01:09:08.250]  No one would put up with this.
[01:09:08.250 --> 01:09:12.450]  This is unbelievable that they're this desperate and going
[01:09:12.450 --> 01:09:14.010]  for this. So let's talk about it.
[01:09:14.010 --> 01:09:17.090]  Let's talk about how you see this unfolding and more predictions
[01:09:17.090 --> 01:09:19.330]  you've got because you were on months ago saying you believe
[01:09:19.330 --> 01:09:21.170]  Jack Smith in D.C.
[01:09:21.170 --> 01:09:23.210]  will indict Trump on January 6th.
[01:09:23.410 --> 01:09:27.170]  Will it be for the alternate electors that, again, Kennedy did
[01:09:27.170 --> 01:09:29.730]  as well, as you mentioned, and it's right there in history and
[01:09:29.730 --> 01:09:33.930]  law? Or will it be actually claiming insurrection, which we
[01:09:33.930 --> 01:09:34.850]  know they wanted to indict?
[01:09:34.850 --> 01:09:37.610]  You and I Washington Post two weeks ago reported claiming we
[01:09:37.650 --> 01:09:39.490]  were being ordered by Trump to attack the Capitol.
[01:09:39.650 --> 01:09:42.370]  All of it totally made it preposterous for me.
[01:09:43.050 --> 01:09:44.490]  It is otherworldly.
[01:09:44.490 --> 01:09:46.370]  I feel like I'm in a dream right now, Roger.
[01:09:46.410 --> 01:09:49.330]  Like I'm pinching myself like, am I really talking to his top
[01:09:49.330 --> 01:09:52.010]  advisor? Is this all really just are they really trying to
[01:09:52.010 --> 01:09:53.010]  frame us right now?
[01:09:53.050 --> 01:09:55.410]  And the answer is, yeah, we testified to Congress, both of
[01:09:55.410 --> 01:09:57.490]  us, you know, had to tell him, no, we didn't attack the
[01:09:57.490 --> 01:09:58.809]  Capitol. You weren't even there.
[01:09:59.010 --> 01:10:00.930]  I mean, this is just surreal.
[01:10:00.930 --> 01:10:01.930]  Roger Stone.
[01:10:02.930 --> 01:10:06.130]  Yeah, it's Kafkaesque, you're absolutely right, but it just
[01:10:06.130 --> 01:10:09.530]  demonstrates what an existential threat Donald Trump is to the
[01:10:09.530 --> 01:10:13.450]  established order. He is a disruptor and they can't have
[01:10:13.450 --> 01:10:17.850]  that. They're trying to move the country as briskly to World War
[01:10:17.850 --> 01:10:21.370]  Three as they can, while Joe Biden and the members of his
[01:10:21.370 --> 01:10:26.290]  family line their own pockets with multimillion dollar payments
[01:10:26.290 --> 01:10:29.050]  from foreign governments and entities.
[01:10:29.330 --> 01:10:33.450]  So, you know, this is all coming down very, very quickly because
[01:10:33.450 --> 01:10:35.450]  the calendar is crucial.
[01:10:35.650 --> 01:10:39.170]  You know, it has always been clear to me that they would seek
[01:10:39.490 --> 01:10:44.250]  to charge Trump in the District of Columbia, where the system
[01:10:44.250 --> 01:10:47.730]  is so broken that no Republican, no conservative, no
[01:10:47.730 --> 01:10:52.330]  freethinker, no non-liberal Democrat can get a fair trial
[01:10:52.330 --> 01:10:54.050]  under any circumstances.
[01:10:54.290 --> 01:10:58.809]  And when I see these lawyers on TV making cogent arguments,
[01:10:58.809 --> 01:11:02.969]  please understand in D.C., the law, the Constitution, the
[01:11:03.010 --> 01:11:07.330]  rules, the facts, the evidence, none of these things matter.
[01:11:08.090 --> 01:11:12.690]  In my case, I had a jury forewoman who testified in jury
[01:11:12.690 --> 01:11:14.250]  selection. She didn't know who I was.
[01:11:14.410 --> 01:11:18.050]  She knew nothing about my case, but she had been attacking me
[01:11:18.050 --> 01:11:22.130]  on Twitter and Facebook for a year before she was chosen as
[01:11:22.130 --> 01:11:23.370]  a juror in my case.
[01:11:23.610 --> 01:11:27.570]  She kept those attacks on me and on Donald Trump on a private
[01:11:27.570 --> 01:11:32.410]  setting and then tried to quietly delete them after the
[01:11:32.410 --> 01:11:35.210]  trial. And the judge actually ruled that none of that was
[01:11:35.210 --> 01:11:36.290]  evidence of bias.
[01:11:36.290 --> 01:11:39.690]  So the rule book, the Constitution, the law, these things
[01:11:39.690 --> 01:11:42.090]  are out the window, which is why Mr.
[01:11:42.090 --> 01:11:45.809]  Smith is so anxious to find some charge in the District of
[01:11:45.809 --> 01:11:50.210]  Columbia. The charges pending against the president in Florida
[01:11:50.210 --> 01:11:51.050]  are important.
[01:11:51.290 --> 01:11:54.809]  It's a flawed case, as Trump has pointed out under the
[01:11:54.809 --> 01:11:59.650]  Presidential Records Act, as decided by the judge in my case,
[01:11:59.690 --> 01:12:03.330]  Judge Amy Berman Jackson, a president can do whatever he wants
[01:12:03.330 --> 01:12:04.170]  with the records.
[01:12:04.370 --> 01:12:08.210]  But more importantly, Roger, let's not even defend Trump.
[01:12:08.210 --> 01:12:09.690]  Everybody knows he's innocent.
[01:12:09.690 --> 01:12:11.010]  Everyone knows you're innocent.
[01:12:11.010 --> 01:12:12.250]  I don't need to believe you.
[01:12:12.250 --> 01:12:15.170]  I was there saying, I'll give you a job at Infowars.
[01:12:15.170 --> 01:12:16.769]  I'm not acting powerful, but you wanted one.
[01:12:16.769 --> 01:12:17.610]  Well, you got one later.
[01:12:17.610 --> 01:12:20.570]  Anyways, if you'll get me, Julian Assange, you said, well,
[01:12:20.570 --> 01:12:22.570]  I know this Randy Credico guy that talks to him.
[01:12:22.570 --> 01:12:24.170]  I'm going to try to get him on the show.
[01:12:24.170 --> 01:12:29.370]  And then Assange was on TV saying, it's going to hurt Hillary.
[01:12:29.370 --> 01:12:31.210]  And you're like, I hear it's going to hurt Hillary.
[01:12:31.210 --> 01:12:35.010]  And off of that, they indicted and convicted you for running
[01:12:35.010 --> 01:12:37.170]  WikiLeaks. I mean, that's ridiculous.
[01:12:37.170 --> 01:12:39.490]  Julian Assange was all over TV then.
[01:12:40.570 --> 01:12:43.370]  Yeah, I'm not trying to rehash my own case.
[01:12:43.370 --> 01:12:47.050]  No, I mean, but it was crazy because they convicted you for nothing.
[01:12:47.889 --> 01:12:51.450]  But here's an important point, and that is there were challenges
[01:12:51.850 --> 01:12:56.130]  to the legitimacy of Robert Mueller's appointment in D.C.
[01:12:56.210 --> 01:12:58.610]  He was never confirmed by the Congress.
[01:12:58.850 --> 01:13:01.170]  And for a number of other constitutional reasons,
[01:13:01.170 --> 01:13:05.010]  absent a special counsel law, which we do not have in place right now,
[01:13:05.210 --> 01:13:07.610]  he never had the authority to prosecute anyone.
[01:13:07.930 --> 01:13:10.809]  That was wrongly decided in the District of Columbia.
[01:13:11.050 --> 01:13:14.610]  When Trump's lawyers, who I have minimal confidence in,
[01:13:14.610 --> 01:13:17.530]  in all honesty, at least his current legal team,
[01:13:18.210 --> 01:13:22.690]  filed their response to the court, they did have a marker in there
[01:13:22.690 --> 01:13:27.130]  that allows them to question the legitimacy of Jack Smith's appointment.
[01:13:27.330 --> 01:13:28.410]  I expect that.
[01:13:28.410 --> 01:13:32.730]  I hope that will be a major thrust of their defense in Florida,
[01:13:32.850 --> 01:13:35.769]  because if it were found to be true in Florida,
[01:13:35.850 --> 01:13:37.050]  it would knock out Mr.
[01:13:37.050 --> 01:13:40.170]  Smith's authority in New York now in D.C.
[01:13:40.170 --> 01:13:41.450]  Now, I'm not an attorney.
[01:13:41.450 --> 01:13:42.969]  I don't pretend to be one.
[01:13:42.969 --> 01:13:46.370]  I'm not going to comment on charges that haven't been filed yet.
[01:13:46.490 --> 01:13:51.530]  We don't know what this pertains to, but they have to have an unfair fight.
[01:13:51.769 --> 01:13:56.050]  They're apoplectic about the fact that this case had to be brought,
[01:13:56.050 --> 01:13:59.010]  that the documents case had to be brought in Florida
[01:13:59.290 --> 01:14:03.010]  because under the constitutional decision by the Supreme Court,
[01:14:03.370 --> 01:14:06.010]  the case against you must be brought in the jurisdiction
[01:14:06.010 --> 01:14:08.490]  where the crime allegedly took place.
[01:14:08.730 --> 01:14:13.570]  And then just through the hand of God, Donald Trump got an honest judge.
[01:14:13.570 --> 01:14:15.090]  Yeah, it's a judge he appointed.
[01:14:15.090 --> 01:14:16.330]  So what?
[01:14:16.330 --> 01:14:20.250]  You had no problem with me being a being tried by an activist
[01:14:20.250 --> 01:14:25.130]  Democrat left wing judge appointed by by Barack Obama.
[01:14:25.130 --> 01:14:26.730]  You had no problem with that.
[01:14:26.730 --> 01:14:29.330]  So they're apoplectic
[01:14:29.330 --> 01:14:33.850]  that Trump might actually get a fair trial, will probably be acquitted in Florida,
[01:14:34.050 --> 01:14:36.050]  which is why they have to do this.
[01:14:36.050 --> 01:14:38.370]  Andrew Weissman didn't know.
[01:14:38.370 --> 01:14:39.010]  I totally agree.
[01:14:39.010 --> 01:14:41.250]  But let's pull back to a hundred thousand feet here.
[01:14:43.010 --> 01:14:45.769]  You don't need to be a rocket scientist, but you are when it comes to politics.
[01:14:46.090 --> 01:14:50.050]  What does this do if New York boosted Trump ten points?
[01:14:50.530 --> 01:14:53.250]  The federal indictment, 15, 20 points,
[01:14:53.490 --> 01:14:57.490]  75 points in polls now ahead of all Republicans in the field,
[01:14:57.490 --> 01:14:59.570]  20, 30 points ahead of Biden.
[01:14:59.570 --> 01:15:05.410]  I think it's fair to say he's as popular as George Washington was in 1789.
[01:15:06.170 --> 01:15:08.570]  I don't know how.
[01:15:08.570 --> 01:15:10.290]  They think they're going to follow through with this,
[01:15:10.290 --> 01:15:13.490]  but how do you expect this with the timing to play out?
[01:15:13.690 --> 01:15:16.610]  Clear election meddling, clearly trying to block who we want.
[01:15:16.850 --> 01:15:18.330]  The public sees it.
[01:15:18.330 --> 01:15:19.570]  I go out in public.
[01:15:19.570 --> 01:15:21.410]  You are public. I got nothing but love now.
[01:15:21.410 --> 01:15:23.130]  The worm has really turned.
[01:15:23.130 --> 01:15:27.330]  I think Jack Smith and Merritt Garland and their little bubbles don't get this.
[01:15:27.330 --> 01:15:32.570]  But how do you see this unfolding as they try to convict
[01:15:32.769 --> 01:15:35.210]  the obvious mega front runner?
[01:15:36.690 --> 01:15:38.490]  I mean, I don't see them getting away with this.
[01:15:38.490 --> 01:15:39.410]  This is crazy.
[01:15:40.889 --> 01:15:43.410]  Well, first of all, I wasn't alive in 1789,
[01:15:43.410 --> 01:15:46.930]  and I categorically denied that I was the head of youth for Washington.
[01:15:47.250 --> 01:15:50.610]  But putting that aside, no, I think you're right.
[01:15:50.610 --> 01:15:52.290]  It's a massive miscalculation.
[01:15:52.290 --> 01:15:53.769]  Look, we've seen this before.
[01:15:53.769 --> 01:15:57.730]  Jimmy Carter and his top advisers wanted to run against Ronald Reagan,
[01:15:57.889 --> 01:16:02.290]  thought he would be easy to beat Hillary Clinton and her corrupt advisers
[01:16:02.450 --> 01:16:05.889]  wanted to get run against Donald Trump, thought he would be the easiest
[01:16:05.889 --> 01:16:07.250]  candidate to beat.
[01:16:07.250 --> 01:16:11.650]  I expect Trump will take a further advance in his poll ratings.
[01:16:11.650 --> 01:16:14.930]  He's going to become even more popular if that's possible,
[01:16:15.450 --> 01:16:17.730]  because I've never seen poll numbers like this.
[01:16:17.730 --> 01:16:19.889]  And I've been doing this for 45 years.
[01:16:20.170 --> 01:16:22.210]  He's more popular than the great Ronald Reagan.
[01:16:22.210 --> 01:16:25.330]  And Reagan was very, very, very popular.
[01:16:25.610 --> 01:16:29.690]  The intensity of Trump's support is going to be further galvanized
[01:16:29.850 --> 01:16:32.690]  and he's going to take in millions of dollars more in small
[01:16:32.690 --> 01:16:34.730]  and medium sized contributions.
[01:16:34.730 --> 01:16:37.650]  Meanwhile, the candidacy of his various challengers, including
[01:16:37.650 --> 01:16:40.250]  Governor DeSantis, are on the verge of collapse
[01:16:40.250 --> 01:16:43.969]  if they haven't already collapsed, as most Republicans,
[01:16:44.290 --> 01:16:48.850]  many Americans, particularly independents, rally behind the president.
[01:16:48.850 --> 01:16:51.969]  So that which does not kill me makes me stronger.
[01:16:51.969 --> 01:16:53.250]  I think Nietzsche said that.
[01:16:53.250 --> 01:16:56.090]  But it's a perfect example of what's going on here.
[01:16:56.330 --> 01:17:00.889]  Every time they charge Trump with another fabricated crime
[01:17:01.050 --> 01:17:05.570]  in an effort to to cheat in the next election or not have a next election
[01:17:06.130 --> 01:17:09.490]  that involves Donald Trump, they're only boosting his strength.
[01:17:09.490 --> 01:17:11.370]  And he will use it.
[01:17:11.370 --> 01:17:12.850]  No, I totally agree.
[01:17:12.850 --> 01:17:16.969]  So how do you see these waves, this giant populist wave coming in?
[01:17:16.969 --> 01:17:18.170]  That's way bigger than the left.
[01:17:18.170 --> 01:17:19.330]  But they've got the Justice Department.
[01:17:19.330 --> 01:17:20.850]  They still think they're going to do it.
[01:17:20.850 --> 01:17:23.930]  Don't they see that that is just destroying them?
[01:17:24.170 --> 01:17:25.690]  So they've got to have some plan.
[01:17:25.690 --> 01:17:27.130]  I think it's false flag terror.
[01:17:27.130 --> 01:17:31.530]  I think they blow up buildings after they indict Trump and say a Trump supporter
[01:17:31.530 --> 01:17:34.690]  blows up federal buildings or something like that.
[01:17:34.969 --> 01:17:37.410]  Schools, you name it, for Trump.
[01:17:37.850 --> 01:17:39.290]  In fact, I don't think I know.
[01:17:39.290 --> 01:17:41.210]  Clinton did that in ninety five.
[01:17:41.210 --> 01:17:46.090]  He credited on Air Force One to the whole media that Oklahoma City saved him.
[01:17:46.090 --> 01:17:47.889]  It was 15 points behind.
[01:17:47.889 --> 01:17:50.410]  I think they're going to false flag stuff and blame Trump supporters.
[01:17:51.690 --> 01:17:55.290]  Well, Alex, this is a very, very key point, because I'm sure right now
[01:17:55.290 --> 01:17:59.250]  across the country, there are many, many Americans who are very, very upset.
[01:17:59.530 --> 01:18:01.210]  That's part of the plan, folks.
[01:18:01.210 --> 01:18:04.330]  They want to goad you into doing something stupid.
[01:18:04.610 --> 01:18:09.490]  They want to goad you into breaking the law or or or
[01:18:09.490 --> 01:18:11.090]  otherwise inciting violence.
[01:18:11.090 --> 01:18:12.769]  Don't take the bait.
[01:18:13.050 --> 01:18:15.050]  Whatever you do, don't take the bait.
[01:18:15.210 --> 01:18:18.650]  If you choose to protest, keep it legal, keep it orderly.
[01:18:18.650 --> 01:18:20.969]  But Roger, obviously, I know you got to get on record.
[01:18:20.969 --> 01:18:22.210]  We're saying be peaceful.
[01:18:22.210 --> 01:18:23.290]  We're not going to do that.
[01:18:23.290 --> 01:18:27.570]  So what do we do when an NGO detonates a truck bomb and blames it on us?
[01:18:27.690 --> 01:18:30.050]  And they're going to say you and I actually ran the attack.
[01:18:30.050 --> 01:18:31.610]  How do we respond to that ahead of time?
[01:18:31.610 --> 01:18:32.450]  Because, you know, it's coming.
[01:18:32.450 --> 01:18:36.130]  Look, I mean, I'd say 95 percent chance truck bombs, mass shootings
[01:18:36.290 --> 01:18:38.290]  blamed on Trump, blamed on you, blamed on me.
[01:18:38.610 --> 01:18:42.050]  I would say right after he's indicted, I mean, what do you think?
[01:18:43.210 --> 01:18:47.730]  This is the importance of Infowars remaining the force and the voice that it is.
[01:18:48.050 --> 01:18:52.450]  This is why it's so vitally important that we have alternative media in this country,
[01:18:52.690 --> 01:18:57.010]  because when we try to defend ourselves and we try to correct the record, trust me,
[01:18:57.010 --> 01:19:02.730]  the folks at MSNBC and CNN and CBS and ABC and NBC and The New York Times
[01:19:02.730 --> 01:19:05.850]  and The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal simply won't cover it.
[01:19:05.850 --> 01:19:06.809]  They won't cover it.
[01:19:07.330 --> 01:19:10.050]  You agree that minus them doing a false flag,
[01:19:10.330 --> 01:19:13.690]  these attacks on populism and who we want and our president won't work.
[01:19:13.809 --> 01:19:17.210]  I'm just saying, how else are they going to do this
[01:19:17.210 --> 01:19:18.730]  when it's destroying them and get away with it?
[01:19:18.730 --> 01:19:23.610]  I don't see how else another war, a power outage, a meteorite.
[01:19:23.769 --> 01:19:27.809]  How do they change the subject from the persecution of who we want
[01:19:27.969 --> 01:19:29.490]  and who our president is?
[01:19:29.490 --> 01:19:32.809]  How do they grab victory from the jaws of defeat, Roger Stone?
[01:19:33.769 --> 01:19:38.809]  The people who are capable of covering up the finding of a bag of cocaine
[01:19:38.969 --> 01:19:42.090]  in one of the most heavily surveilled places on Earth,
[01:19:42.250 --> 01:19:44.969]  the White House are capable of anything.
[01:19:45.410 --> 01:19:50.690]  And therefore, I think their guess is that if they can just eliminate Trump,
[01:19:51.010 --> 01:19:54.570]  they'll they can railroad anything they want through the D.C. courts,
[01:19:54.570 --> 01:19:56.050]  including his incarceration.
[01:19:56.530 --> 01:19:59.730]  And they know that the people will not, based on what they've seen,
[01:19:59.969 --> 01:20:02.490]  January six, be able to do anything less.
[01:20:02.490 --> 01:20:05.010]  They, too, be crushed and incarcerated.
[01:20:05.010 --> 01:20:06.969]  We don't advocate that, by the way.
[01:20:06.969 --> 01:20:09.850]  Just to be clear, it's a power play.
[01:20:09.850 --> 01:20:11.610]  It's the ultimate power play.
[01:20:11.610 --> 01:20:15.290]  Once they got power, they never intended to relinquish it.
[01:20:15.490 --> 01:20:18.450]  And therefore, they are capable of absolutely anything.
[01:20:18.450 --> 01:20:22.210]  People who will charge a former president of the United States,
[01:20:22.210 --> 01:20:25.809]  who is the leading candidate for president leading in the polls by,
[01:20:25.809 --> 01:20:31.330]  as he would say, a lot will do absolutely anything to cling to power and money.
[01:20:31.969 --> 01:20:38.330]  And as I said at the conference on Sunday, I still believe I still absolutely
[01:20:38.330 --> 01:20:42.850]  believe that it is their intention to give Joe Biden the hook.
[01:20:43.130 --> 01:20:44.530]  The guy can't stand up.
[01:20:44.530 --> 01:20:45.809]  He's not coherent.
[01:20:45.809 --> 01:20:47.330]  He's embarrassing them.
[01:20:47.330 --> 01:20:50.530]  And his thievery is now there for everybody to see.
[01:20:50.650 --> 01:20:52.330]  It's one of the reasons they chose him, by the way,
[01:20:52.330 --> 01:20:55.250]  is because they had the goods on him and they knew they could control.
[01:20:55.290 --> 01:20:57.969]  Sure. He just mentally degraded faster than they thought.
[01:20:57.969 --> 01:21:00.610]  So they wanted to have him there to blame for their criminality,
[01:21:00.610 --> 01:21:02.170]  to control him, to flush him.
[01:21:02.170 --> 01:21:04.010]  But he's rotted so bad they got to get rid of him.
[01:21:04.010 --> 01:21:06.450]  And you say you still say you've been vindicated.
[01:21:06.450 --> 01:21:08.130]  You were on my show
[01:21:08.130 --> 01:21:11.570]  three years ago during the campaign when I got banned again on Facebook,
[01:21:11.570 --> 01:21:15.850]  even more as a dangerous person for saying he's obviously had a stroke or something wrong.
[01:21:17.010 --> 01:21:20.049]  And you said all of this at the time, what Biden was going to do,
[01:21:20.290 --> 01:21:23.010]  what he was going to carry out and that they would then
[01:21:23.969 --> 01:21:27.610]  replace him with Big Mike or Gavin Newsom.
[01:21:28.330 --> 01:21:30.049]  You say you're still saying it now.
[01:21:30.049 --> 01:21:33.129]  There's op eds, The Wall Street Journal, New York Times everywhere
[01:21:33.129 --> 01:21:34.770]  saying we got to get rid of Biden.
[01:21:34.770 --> 01:21:36.450]  How does he step down Politico?
[01:21:36.450 --> 01:21:37.450]  He's got to go.
[01:21:37.450 --> 01:21:39.490]  I mean, they're clearly trying to give him the hook.
[01:21:39.809 --> 01:21:43.850]  But I'm told Jill Biden, like you said, likes the parties and all of it too much
[01:21:44.010 --> 01:21:48.290]  that he's now holding on like a like a, you know,
[01:21:49.210 --> 01:21:52.809]  old cicada on a tree in the wintertime before he blows away.
[01:21:52.889 --> 01:21:54.969]  How do you see that unfolding?
[01:21:54.969 --> 01:21:56.290]  Well, first of all, I think Dr.
[01:21:56.290 --> 01:21:57.730]  Jill's not going to go easily.
[01:21:57.730 --> 01:22:00.690]  I mean, she wouldn't have access then to the curtains and tablecloths
[01:22:00.690 --> 01:22:03.410]  that she uses to make her clothing, quite obviously.
[01:22:04.049 --> 01:22:07.969]  And Joe Biden has endless supply of children that he can sniff.
[01:22:07.969 --> 01:22:10.690]  And otherwise, you know,
[01:22:11.450 --> 01:22:13.049]  his nuzzle, what do you call that?
[01:22:13.049 --> 01:22:14.690]  A video still blows my mind.
[01:22:14.690 --> 01:22:16.170]  He rips them with his nose.
[01:22:16.170 --> 01:22:17.049]  It's disgusting.
[01:22:18.090 --> 01:22:21.530]  I mean, they're not going to go easily, but they will go
[01:22:21.530 --> 01:22:23.930]  because in the end, if he refuses to go,
[01:22:24.570 --> 01:22:27.129]  he will be removed under the 25th Amendment,
[01:22:27.290 --> 01:22:29.690]  which only requires a majority of the cabinet
[01:22:30.129 --> 01:22:32.610]  and the acquiescence of the sitting vice president.
[01:22:32.850 --> 01:22:35.250]  Barack Obama could orchestrate.
[01:22:35.250 --> 01:22:39.690]  An afternoon in an afternoon, and then Joe wouldn't have the opportunity
[01:22:39.850 --> 01:22:44.010]  to pardon himself and his brother and his son and other members
[01:22:44.010 --> 01:22:45.889]  of the Biden crime family.
[01:22:45.889 --> 01:22:48.250]  Now, Alex, this is a key point.
[01:22:48.250 --> 01:22:51.690]  When it was speculated that Trump was going to pardon himself
[01:22:51.889 --> 01:22:54.770]  for some unspecified crime before leaving office,
[01:22:55.170 --> 01:22:58.969]  lunatics like Lawrence tried the worst lawyer in America.
[01:22:59.090 --> 01:23:01.530]  Nothing this guy says is accurate or true.
[01:23:02.650 --> 01:23:04.090]  He's embarrassing.
[01:23:04.090 --> 01:23:06.850]  Oh, Trump doesn't have the authority to pardon himself.
[01:23:06.850 --> 01:23:10.170]  But watch when when Joe Biden pardons himself,
[01:23:10.370 --> 01:23:13.850]  every left wing legal scholar in the world will be telling you,
[01:23:13.850 --> 01:23:16.730]  oh, it's perfectly constitutional. Watch.
[01:23:17.690 --> 01:23:21.610]  Is the system so static and so stagnant
[01:23:22.170 --> 01:23:25.290]  that perhaps Biden is just able to stay in control
[01:23:25.610 --> 01:23:27.129]  because he is the puppet president?
[01:23:27.129 --> 01:23:30.969]  And imagine by the time he is inaugurated again via fraud
[01:23:30.969 --> 01:23:34.090]  or killing Trump or assassinating him or whatever they're going to do
[01:23:34.090 --> 01:23:36.570]  or putting him in prison, that we literally have a president
[01:23:36.570 --> 01:23:39.690]  that isn't seen and can't talk, kind of like Woodrow Wilson.
[01:23:41.090 --> 01:23:43.250]  Well, Wilson was only able to get away with that
[01:23:43.250 --> 01:23:46.250]  because at the times we had no mass media and therefore
[01:23:46.650 --> 01:23:49.889]  the only people that were ever seen were his wife and Colonel House,
[01:23:49.889 --> 01:23:51.930]  his major handler.
[01:23:51.930 --> 01:23:55.010]  But he you know, she would actually put the pen in his hand
[01:23:55.250 --> 01:23:57.490]  and move it to sign important documents.
[01:23:57.770 --> 01:24:00.650]  Joe Biden's problem is that he really doesn't have the power
[01:24:00.850 --> 01:24:03.610]  because were he to give any order whatsoever,
[01:24:03.770 --> 01:24:06.330]  none of the people around him, all of whom are loyal to
[01:24:06.330 --> 01:24:10.450]  and actually work for Barack Obama, would carry out those orders.
[01:24:10.650 --> 01:24:13.370]  So I think he's cooked. I think he's done.
[01:24:13.570 --> 01:24:17.049]  I kind of feel sorry for him because at this point it's elder abuse.
[01:24:17.250 --> 01:24:21.570]  It's time for him to retire to the beach in in in in Rehoboth.
[01:24:22.049 --> 01:24:25.650]  If he pardons himself, he'll still have all that money that he and his son stole.
[01:24:26.250 --> 01:24:28.930]  He really ought to ride off into the sunset if he were smart.
[01:24:29.170 --> 01:24:31.570]  But the Obamas play for keeps.
[01:24:31.570 --> 01:24:35.290]  And if he won't go along, if he won't resign quietly,
[01:24:35.930 --> 01:24:38.330]  then they will actually, I think, remove him
[01:24:38.330 --> 01:24:42.129]  because they cannot possibly pull off an election with him at the helm.
[01:24:42.370 --> 01:24:46.049]  If you went into election day and he's trailing by 10 points,
[01:24:46.049 --> 01:24:49.930]  which is entirely possible, it's going to be very hard to convince people
[01:24:49.930 --> 01:24:53.049]  when you steal the election that the election wasn't stolen.
[01:24:53.090 --> 01:24:56.250]  Well, the last thing I want is anything to happen to Obama's third term
[01:24:57.170 --> 01:24:58.969]  violent because they'll make them victims.
[01:24:58.969 --> 01:25:01.370]  But but Joe Biden is a total puppet.
[01:25:01.370 --> 01:25:02.930]  Some people say, oh, what about Kamala?
[01:25:02.930 --> 01:25:06.170]  She's completely drugged out of her head, even dumber than Biden.
[01:25:06.450 --> 01:25:10.010]  Some people would say, oh, the elite doesn't want her in there as president.
[01:25:10.010 --> 01:25:11.410]  Don't know what they're talking about.
[01:25:11.410 --> 01:25:15.570]  But I'm really concerned about them assassinating Biden,
[01:25:15.570 --> 01:25:19.129]  recycling him to then say a Trump supporter killed him.
[01:25:19.490 --> 01:25:21.969]  I mean, I think that's a perfect scripting for them.
[01:25:22.129 --> 01:25:23.850]  I'm very concerned about that.
[01:25:23.850 --> 01:25:25.330]  So I pray for Joe Biden.
[01:25:26.889 --> 01:25:30.049]  Geez, that actually sent a shiver up my spine, Alex.
[01:25:30.049 --> 01:25:32.610]  Look, I think these people are capable of absolutely anything.
[01:25:32.770 --> 01:25:35.330]  We don't wish any ill will on Joe Biden.
[01:25:35.330 --> 01:25:38.490]  I just like him to step aside and live out his years in peace.
[01:25:38.690 --> 01:25:40.290]  I don't think he's going to do that.
[01:25:40.290 --> 01:25:43.330]  But if they remove him, they are now stuck with their
[01:25:43.330 --> 01:25:47.370]  with their own handpicked choice choice for vice president Kamala Harris.
[01:25:47.850 --> 01:25:52.090]  She doesn't have senile dementia, but she makes even less sense than Joe Biden.
[01:25:52.610 --> 01:25:55.610]  So therefore, I have said the only way within the current
[01:25:55.610 --> 01:25:59.610]  modern Democratic Party, which will not nominate a white male
[01:25:59.610 --> 01:26:04.490]  for president again in our lifetimes, is to replace a woman of color,
[01:26:04.809 --> 01:26:09.370]  Kamala Harris, with a more popular woman of color, Michelle Obama.
[01:26:09.610 --> 01:26:12.370]  They can raise the hundred million dollars they need overnight.
[01:26:12.410 --> 01:26:14.809]  They can. So you really think it's going to be a big mic?
[01:26:16.010 --> 01:26:17.889]  I really think it will be Michelle Obama.
[01:26:18.049 --> 01:26:20.049]  Yes. Just now.
[01:26:20.049 --> 01:26:22.410]  I just say, Big Mike, just say
[01:26:23.250 --> 01:26:26.730]  speculate about about Michelle Obama's
[01:26:26.889 --> 01:26:29.770]  sexual orientation on your show for period.
[01:26:30.129 --> 01:26:33.730]  You will not say you will not say you say Mike Tyson's Big Mike.
[01:26:35.090 --> 01:26:36.450]  Mike Tyson is Big Mike.
[01:26:36.450 --> 01:26:38.969]  But then that might there's only one Mike Tyson, by the way.
[01:26:39.170 --> 01:26:41.770]  If you didn't interview with Robert F.
[01:26:41.770 --> 01:26:44.770]  Kennedy regarding the assassination of Robert Kennedy, senior,
[01:26:44.969 --> 01:26:47.410]  it's absolutely must say, you know why you need to say it?
[01:26:47.570 --> 01:26:49.570]  Because YouTube took it down, folks.
[01:26:49.570 --> 01:26:51.049]  That's why you've got to see this.
[01:26:51.049 --> 01:26:52.290]  It is absolutely.
[01:26:52.290 --> 01:26:53.049]  Let's bring up that.
[01:26:53.049 --> 01:26:54.889]  I love the callers that think Robert F.
[01:26:54.889 --> 01:26:56.450]  Kennedy, Jr., is a Trojan horse.
[01:26:56.450 --> 01:26:57.969]  He may be wrong on some policies.
[01:26:57.969 --> 01:26:59.010]  He's his own guy.
[01:26:59.010 --> 01:27:01.129]  Just like Trump, he he runs his own life.
[01:27:01.690 --> 01:27:02.210]  Robert F.
[01:27:02.210 --> 01:27:05.490]  Kennedy, Jr.'s father and uncle were murdered by the deep state.
[01:27:06.290 --> 01:27:08.930]  I don't see any way he works for them.
[01:27:08.930 --> 01:27:09.930]  What do you say?
[01:27:09.930 --> 01:27:12.809]  I say he's out to zero chance.
[01:27:12.809 --> 01:27:13.770]  He's a free thinker.
[01:27:13.770 --> 01:27:17.210]  He is identified who murdered his father and his uncle.
[01:27:17.690 --> 01:27:20.170]  He wants to seal our southern border.
[01:27:20.370 --> 01:27:22.250]  He is for health freedom.
[01:27:22.250 --> 01:27:25.370]  He's against this insane rush to war in Ukraine.
[01:27:26.210 --> 01:27:27.610]  You know, on many issues, I agree.
[01:27:27.610 --> 01:27:29.730]  On the other hand, he believes in climate.
[01:27:29.730 --> 01:27:30.969]  You know. Yeah.
[01:27:30.969 --> 01:27:33.850]  So so if he's the Democrat nominee, you're going to support Trump.
[01:27:34.850 --> 01:27:36.610]  I'm supporting Trump no matter what.
[01:27:36.610 --> 01:27:37.410]  It's Trump.
[01:27:37.410 --> 01:27:39.730]  You know, it's ride or die with Donald Trump for me.
[01:27:39.730 --> 01:27:44.730]  But I like Robert Kennedy because he's unafraid, because he challenges
[01:27:44.730 --> 01:27:48.690]  the left wing orthodoxy on some of the most important issues in the country.
[01:27:48.809 --> 01:27:51.170]  I don't agree with him when it comes to abortion.
[01:27:51.170 --> 01:27:52.770]  He's he is pro abortion.
[01:27:52.770 --> 01:27:53.730]  I'm pro life.
[01:27:53.730 --> 01:27:56.090]  I don't agree with him about the climate hoax.
[01:27:56.090 --> 01:27:58.809]  But well, now he's saying the climate things, the power grabs.
[01:27:58.809 --> 01:28:00.210]  He's moving towards us.
[01:28:00.210 --> 01:28:01.090]  The system hates him.
[01:28:01.090 --> 01:28:02.290]  30 seconds left.
[01:28:02.490 --> 01:28:04.889]  Roger Stone, you host a weekday show.
[01:28:04.889 --> 01:28:06.969]  You've got a very popular WBC show.
[01:28:06.969 --> 01:28:08.809]  Tell people how we find everything, Roger Stone.
[01:28:09.610 --> 01:28:13.969]  Sure. Go to Stone's own dot live every day at five o'clock Eastern,

[01:28:17.090 --> 01:28:20.730]  I have Colby Covington, the UFC champion
[01:28:20.930 --> 01:28:24.610]  who's headed to a big, big fight at Madison Square Garden for the championship
[01:28:25.129 --> 01:28:30.210]  today at Stone's own dot live at four o'clock Central, five o'clock Eastern.
[01:28:30.210 --> 01:28:34.290]  And just go to Stone's own dot com Stone's own dot com.
[01:28:34.490 --> 01:28:38.170]  You can see all my videos, read what I have written and go by the store
[01:28:38.170 --> 01:28:40.770]  and get yourself a copy of the man who killed Kennedy.
[01:28:40.770 --> 01:28:44.370]  The case against LBJ or your Roger Stone did nothing wrong.
[01:28:44.370 --> 01:28:48.930]  T-shirt or your epically hysterical Roger Stone.
[01:28:48.930 --> 01:28:50.969]  Go there now. All right, Roger, we love you.
[01:28:50.969 --> 01:28:52.129]  Praying for President Trump.
[01:28:52.129 --> 01:28:53.809]  Big news. Breaking news.
[01:28:53.809 --> 01:28:55.969]  Your phone call straight ahead. Thank you, Roger Stone.
[01:28:56.129 --> 01:28:57.090]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:28:58.049 --> 01:29:01.010]  The globalists aren't just targeting us through the poison shots
[01:29:01.250 --> 01:29:04.129]  or the electromagnetic 5G or the GMO crops.
[01:29:04.490 --> 01:29:06.450]  They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals
[01:29:06.650 --> 01:29:10.250]  that the EPA has authorized companies and industry to use.
[01:29:10.850 --> 01:29:13.889]  One of the top pesticides used is atrazine.
[01:29:14.210 --> 01:29:17.690]  The allowable level the government admits that they allow to be in your water
[01:29:17.690 --> 01:29:22.530]  supply is enough to sterilize you and basically turn your son into a feminized
[01:29:22.530 --> 01:29:23.969]  mutant. Look it up.
[01:29:24.450 --> 01:29:25.850]  Don't let them do this to your family.
[01:29:26.330 --> 01:29:29.330]  We have the very best gravity fed filter system out there.
[01:29:29.450 --> 01:29:32.570]  Highest rated at half the price of leading competitors.

[01:29:35.049 --> 01:29:37.170]  We have replacement filters for folks who've already gotten it.
[01:29:37.290 --> 01:29:39.010]  It does 10,000 gallons where you replace them.
[01:29:39.129 --> 01:29:41.889]  It is amazing. It's great for your home, your business.
[01:29:41.889 --> 01:29:45.010]  You put swamp water in it, tap water, whatever, well water.
[01:29:45.010 --> 01:29:46.290]  Almost everything's contaminated.
[01:29:46.450 --> 01:29:49.889]  This is how you take control of the fluids in your body and counter the globalist
[01:29:49.889 --> 01:29:53.049]  onslaught. Get yours today at Infoworkstore.com for a limited time.

[01:29:55.650 --> 01:29:56.809]  Sorry, the lowest price out there.
[01:29:56.889 --> 01:29:57.889]  You need this filter.
[01:29:58.370 --> 01:29:59.930]  The globalists are only humans.
[01:30:00.610 --> 01:30:02.290]  Yeah, they have control of the central banks.
[01:30:02.290 --> 01:30:04.210]  They have a lot of power, but they can be defeated.
[01:30:04.570 --> 01:30:07.250]  But some of their operations are going to take decades to stop.
[01:30:07.770 --> 01:30:11.450]  But one thing you can do right now is take control of your body and your family's
[01:30:11.450 --> 01:30:15.610]  body by purifying the water that you drink and that you cook with.
[01:30:16.010 --> 01:30:19.290]  And you do it with the highest quality gravity fed filter out there.
[01:30:19.610 --> 01:30:21.330]  This thing does 10,000 gallons.
[01:30:21.809 --> 01:30:24.210]  You can sit there and put hundreds of gallons through the day.
[01:30:24.450 --> 01:30:27.850]  It purifies very quickly and it cuts out thousands of chemicals to
[01:30:27.850 --> 01:30:28.930]  non-detectable levels.
[01:30:29.090 --> 01:30:30.889]  This is what I use, which my family uses.
[01:30:31.090 --> 01:30:33.889]  It's the very best system out there for the lowest price for a limited time.
[01:30:33.889 --> 01:30:35.770]  10 percent off on top of that.
[01:30:36.010 --> 01:30:41.250]  Exclusively at Infoworkstore.com on the Alexa Pure water filtration system in
[01:30:41.250 --> 01:30:44.450]  stock and replacement filters for folks that need those in stock.
[01:30:44.730 --> 01:30:46.570]  Get it today and it funds the Infowork.
[01:30:46.809 --> 01:30:50.049]  Don't procrastinate. This is one of the main areas we can take control of our
[01:30:50.049 --> 01:30:53.770]  lives and stop the globalists from hitting us with poison that they allow in
[01:30:53.770 --> 01:30:57.090]  the water supply. In some cases, they add the water supply like fluoride.
[01:30:58.410 --> 01:31:02.129]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and War for the World, is a
[01:31:02.129 --> 01:31:06.210]  historic book that documents the globalists in their own words, plan for our
[01:31:06.210 --> 01:31:07.650]  future. That is a hellish future.
[01:31:08.129 --> 01:31:11.210]  Now, you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban
[01:31:11.210 --> 01:31:15.010]  them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and War for the World at
[01:31:15.010 --> 01:31:17.129]  bookstores, Amazon or Infoworkstore.com.
[01:31:17.450 --> 01:31:21.450]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed
[01:31:21.450 --> 01:31:23.010]  copies we got run out.
[01:31:23.049 --> 01:31:25.170]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[01:31:25.610 --> 01:31:29.930]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World, a signed copy at
[01:31:29.930 --> 01:31:34.170]  Infoworkstore.com. And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep
[01:31:34.170 --> 01:31:37.969]  us on the air. So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book.
[01:31:38.010 --> 01:31:40.610]  You'll also know that you help keep Infowars on the air.
[01:31:40.850 --> 01:31:44.210]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned
[01:31:44.210 --> 01:31:49.129]  copies. But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to Infowarsstore.com
[01:31:49.170 --> 01:31:52.530]  and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate them to the
[01:31:52.530 --> 01:31:54.969]  library or give them to the local school.
[01:31:55.170 --> 01:31:57.889]  This is an Infowar. I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[01:31:57.969 --> 01:32:04.090]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off gassing highly toxic fluoride gases
[01:32:04.170 --> 01:32:07.969]  into the atmosphere. The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[01:32:08.170 --> 01:32:13.690]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers to convert
[01:32:13.690 --> 01:32:18.770]  these gases into fluorosilicic acid, still highly toxic but containable.
[01:32:18.889 --> 01:32:23.889]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison and there was no affordable way to
[01:32:23.889 --> 01:32:28.889]  dispose of it. Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the Secretary
[01:32:28.889 --> 01:32:32.969]  of the Treasury, who was responsible for the public health service at the time.
[01:32:33.170 --> 01:32:35.129]  And by 1950, the U.S.
[01:32:35.129 --> 01:32:40.610]  government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste product and dumping it
[01:32:40.650 --> 01:32:41.969]  into our drinking water.
[01:32:42.170 --> 01:32:47.170]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[01:32:47.370 --> 01:32:52.450]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water and a remedy to this
[01:32:52.450 --> 01:32:56.730]  madness. Available now at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:32:57.740 --> 01:33:07.740]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:08.910 --> 01:33:23.910]  We are here today to tell you, you picked this fight, you wanted this fight, well guess what? You've got it. Let's fight.
[01:33:23.910 --> 01:33:28.910]  It's 1159 at Radio Free America and this is Uncle Sam with music and the truth until dawn.
[01:33:28.910 --> 01:33:32.910]  Right now I've got a few words for some of our brothers and sisters in the occupied zone.
[01:33:32.910 --> 01:33:37.910]  The chair is against the wall. The chair is against the wall.
[01:33:37.910 --> 01:33:41.910]  John has a long mustache. John has a long mustache.
[01:33:41.910 --> 01:33:44.910]  It's 12 o'clock Americans, another day closer to victory.
[01:33:44.910 --> 01:33:51.910]  And for all of you out there on or behind the lines, this is your song.
[01:33:51.910 --> 01:33:57.910]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this,
[01:33:57.910 --> 01:34:03.910]  but you want to fight, you better believe you've got one.
[01:34:03.910 --> 01:34:10.910]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:34:10.910 --> 01:34:13.910]  Humanity's not going down without a fight.
[01:34:13.910 --> 01:34:21.910]  At the very front of the battle for humanity and our future is info wars and this operation.
[01:34:21.910 --> 01:34:27.910]  You've got my pledge to the best job I can, but I can't do it without you.
[01:34:27.910 --> 01:34:35.910]  All right, folks, I want to open the phones up for several hours here and take your phone calls on Trump.
[01:34:35.910 --> 01:34:39.910]  And I love that's a whole nother story. He comes out a few months ago and he goes, yeah,
[01:34:39.910 --> 01:34:48.910]  I've been told we're going to be indicted by Alvin Bragg for this kangaroo garbage with Stormy Daniels in New York.
[01:34:48.910 --> 01:34:51.910]  And the corporate media goes, he's crazy. He's a liar. No one's indicting him.
[01:34:51.910 --> 01:34:54.910]  And they indicted him not the week, he said, but the next week.
[01:34:54.910 --> 01:35:02.910]  And then he goes, yeah, I've been told I'll be indicted in the next week to two weeks for the documents that are my documents.
[01:35:02.910 --> 01:35:07.910]  They indicted him the next day. And so now his lawyers have talked to him and they said, no,
[01:35:07.910 --> 01:35:10.910]  the grand jury's indicted and you get ready.
[01:35:10.910 --> 01:35:14.910]  The corporate media wants to edge this out there like, oh, they're looking at indicting.
[01:35:14.910 --> 01:35:20.910]  No, it's done. And it's for January 6th.
[01:35:20.910 --> 01:35:23.910]  And they literally say that Roger Stone and I quarterbacked an attack and work with Trump.
[01:35:23.910 --> 01:35:27.910]  None of it's true. I can tell you on my children strike me down with a bolt of lightning.
[01:35:27.910 --> 01:35:31.910]  I'm lying. We walked into a trap. Everybody already knows that.
[01:35:31.910 --> 01:35:36.910]  But it is I mean, I feel like I'm in a dream right now.
[01:35:36.910 --> 01:35:39.910]  It's like, how are you taking me and followed by the feds every day and P.I. groups?
[01:35:39.910 --> 01:35:42.910]  And they're all after you. They're harassing all your crew and everything.
[01:35:42.910 --> 01:35:47.910]  I'm just like, they're killing unborn babies. They're trying to cut little kids penises off.
[01:35:47.910 --> 01:35:51.910]  They're not. They're cutting millions of them off. I mean, we're getting screwed over here.
[01:35:51.910 --> 01:35:54.910]  I mean, at least I am a big, strong man.
[01:35:54.910 --> 01:36:00.910]  I'm not saying I'm the biggest and strongest, but I can I can take a lot of pain and I can sure as hell fight.
[01:36:00.910 --> 01:36:05.910]  And I mean, I'm a full grown 49 year old man. And man, I'm shook up by this.
[01:36:05.910 --> 01:36:09.910]  I feel really sorry for the women and children. People ask, how are you handling Jones?
[01:36:09.910 --> 01:36:16.910]  I'm a man and I'm and I'm pretty upset. So all I can tell you is this is bad news, folks.
[01:36:16.910 --> 01:36:22.910]  And when the general public figures out how much trouble they're in, I mean, we got crazy people running stuff.
[01:36:22.910 --> 01:36:28.910]  I mean, these lunatics came up with a poison shot with an HIV delivery system to fry our immune systems.
[01:36:28.910 --> 01:36:33.910]  And they just injected two billion people with it. People go, well, they're getting exposed.
[01:36:33.910 --> 01:36:44.910]  Yeah, they got something bigger. They're about to launch where you're not even going to be thinking about what they just hit you with.
[01:36:44.910 --> 01:36:51.910]  So people say, well, what are you doing, scaring us for the enemy? No, I'm telling you how bad it is.
[01:36:51.910 --> 01:36:56.910]  I mean, you better come to grips, ladies and gentlemen, with the fact that these people don't just want to eat your lunch.
[01:36:56.910 --> 01:37:12.910]  They want to eat you. And realize that because of normalcy bias, someone that always loses kind of gives up on average and thinks they're a loser.
[01:37:12.910 --> 01:37:21.910]  Winners never quit and quitters never win. To quote Vince Lombardi, nothing succeeds like success.
[01:37:21.910 --> 01:37:37.910]  Well, the criminals like Fauci and Bill Gates. And Bill Gates, his father. Have gotten away with such massive crimes against humanity that they believe they can't be defeated.
[01:37:37.910 --> 01:37:44.910]  And that's really what we're dealing with right now. So I want to hit all the rest of the news.
[01:37:44.910 --> 01:37:51.910]  I want to open the phones up, but I want to open the phones up and I'm being really nice. I love the listeners. But I do this like once a month.
[01:37:51.910 --> 01:37:59.910]  We're on one topic, folks, not not the Loch Ness Monster, not flying saucers, not Hunter Biden's laptop.
[01:37:59.910 --> 01:38:05.910]  We all know he's a cokehead pedophile and the government's covering up. We already know all that. All the other shows cover that ad nauseum.
[01:38:05.910 --> 01:38:09.910]  We're not talking about Hunter Biden, the crackhead Chinese agent. We already know that.
[01:38:10.910 --> 01:38:16.910]  It's like we're going to talk. Stop signs are red for two hours. We already know that.
[01:38:16.910 --> 01:38:31.910]  We are talking about. The front runner presidential candidate who had the last election stolen, being prepared to be indicted in D.C., because let me tell you, indicted in Florida.
[01:38:31.910 --> 01:38:37.910]  He'll probably get somewhat of a fair trial. He's going to win that. Indicted by that idiot brag.
[01:38:37.910 --> 01:38:45.910]  They got that indicted in D.C. He could be as pure as Jesus Christ.
[01:38:45.910 --> 01:38:55.910]  They're going to nail his ass to a cross. I'm not saying Trump is as pure as Jesus Christ, but when it comes to corruption, he basically is.
[01:38:55.910 --> 01:39:03.910]  The guy does not take bribes, orders from no one. It's he gives the orders and that's why they don't like him.
[01:39:03.910 --> 01:39:06.910]  So this is where we are right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:39:06.910 --> 01:39:11.910]  These people are crazy enough with the most popular president in modern history.
[01:39:11.910 --> 01:39:17.910]  You heard Roger Stone. He doesn't speculate. He said he's never seen anybody since polling began as popular as Trump.
[01:39:17.910 --> 01:39:24.910]  I mean, I mean, they took him from being popular to ultra popular with this move.
[01:39:24.910 --> 01:39:29.910]  And anybody can look at that and say that's not going to go well for the people that did that.
[01:39:29.910 --> 01:39:32.910]  They don't care, though. You see Jack's for those press conferences.
[01:39:32.910 --> 01:39:38.910]  His knees are knocking. He's stuttering. He looks like he's about to frickin die.
[01:39:38.910 --> 01:39:43.910]  Yeah, dude, you just took on the president of the United States who's super popular and is a good person.
[01:39:43.910 --> 01:39:49.910]  I mean, you're crazy for Chinese communist pedophile crackhead puppets.
[01:39:49.910 --> 01:39:52.910]  I mean, like, you know, it's not like you took down some good dude for something better.
[01:39:52.910 --> 01:39:55.910]  I'd be like, well, I don't like that doing that, but I kind of see.
[01:39:55.910 --> 01:40:02.910]  No, no. You're literally trying to shoot down somebody good for absolute total crap.
[01:40:02.910 --> 01:40:09.910]  That wants to cut off our energy and cut our kids penises off and and butcher the border and smuggle kids.
[01:40:10.910 --> 01:40:15.910]  I mean, you guys are villains, villains. I got a hand to the Democrats and their handlers.
[01:40:15.910 --> 01:40:20.910]  You guys are really bad. I mean, if you're trying to be bad, let me tell you, like,
[01:40:20.910 --> 01:40:23.910]  MS-13 tries to be as MS-13 has come out in their own documents.
[01:40:23.910 --> 01:40:29.910]  It's like, how do we get worse? Let's grab an eight year old girl, rape her and cut her heart out for Satan.
[01:40:29.910 --> 01:40:33.910]  Let's go do that. Yeah. You're like, why?
[01:40:33.910 --> 01:40:37.910]  Well, they've been on methamphetamine for five years and they're whacked out of their minds.
[01:40:37.910 --> 01:40:45.910]  It's like, that's crazy. You're like, why would you kidnap a girl out of her backyard and rape her and then cut her heart out and deliver it to her mom?
[01:40:45.910 --> 01:40:47.910]  Well, it's a nasty, horrible thing to do. Why not?
[01:40:47.910 --> 01:40:52.910]  You're like, you know, a normal person is like, that doesn't sound too nice.
[01:40:52.910 --> 01:40:57.910]  That doesn't sound like a very nice thing to do.
[01:40:58.910 --> 01:41:07.910]  But see, you're not MS-13, you're not Merrick Garland, you're not Barack Obama who has a hard on for this country.
[01:41:07.910 --> 01:41:12.910]  Who feels slighted when he's on a 300 foot luxury yacht eating caviar.
[01:41:12.910 --> 01:41:15.910]  Oh, America sucks. I got to beat it.
[01:41:15.910 --> 01:41:17.910]  All your own stock and slave mines in Africa.
[01:41:17.910 --> 01:41:26.910]  It's all just an excuse to rape and kill and have power over something because America had a potential to defeat evil and Satan knew that.
[01:41:26.910 --> 01:41:31.910]  So the main mission to all of Satan's minions is destroy America now.
[01:41:31.910 --> 01:41:35.910]  Now, go, go, go, go, go. I'll give you power. Just destroy it.
[01:41:35.910 --> 01:41:41.910]  So here's the toll free number. We'll go to break. Come out with your phone calls on Trump.
[01:41:41.910 --> 01:41:50.910]  And the looming D.C. January 6 indictment, which means the American people and all his supporters frame for terror and all of us persecuted more.
[01:41:50.910 --> 01:41:54.910]  It's just the detonator, just the cap on the back of the cartridge.
[01:41:54.910 --> 01:41:58.910]  If you think that January 6 persecution was bad so far, that's just the beginning.
[01:41:58.910 --> 01:42:06.910]  Eight, seven, seven, seven, eight, nine, two, five, three, nine, eight, seven, seven, seven, eight, nine, two, five, three, nine, eight, seven, seven, seven, eight, nine.
[01:42:06.910 --> 01:42:18.910]  Alex on this one subject to focus on this one big subject today on this Tuesday, July 18th, worldwide transmission.
[01:42:19.910 --> 01:42:23.910]  While we're getting the calls lined up, I'm going to come back and take Fauci, the woodshed.
[01:42:23.910 --> 01:42:26.910]  Then we'll take the pitos, the woodshed with a lot of breaking news.
[01:42:26.910 --> 01:42:28.910]  So much will be interspersing with your calls.
[01:42:28.910 --> 01:42:33.910]  What will happen is I'll hit a story, take three or four calls in a story, take three or four more calls.
[01:42:33.910 --> 01:42:36.910]  And who knows? We've got another great guest host, the fourth hour.
[01:42:36.910 --> 01:42:39.910]  But, you know, I've been a little bit of a Miss Piggy these days.
[01:42:39.910 --> 01:42:45.910]  Maria Z is awesome. I'm gonna take 15 minutes, the fourth hour just to make sure we get to all your calls.
[01:42:45.910 --> 01:42:49.910]  Just to make sure we get to all your calls and cover all the news.
[01:42:49.910 --> 01:42:54.910]  So that means we got like an hour and 45 minutes or an hour and 30 minutes straight ahead.
[01:42:54.910 --> 01:42:57.910]  Your phone calls and news. Infowars.com spread that link.
[01:42:57.910 --> 01:43:02.910]  You're going to want to pay attention to what I'm about to say in the next 60 seconds.

[01:43:31.910 --> 01:43:36.910]  Which is one of the major reasons nerves get irritated and are more inductive to pain.
[01:43:36.910 --> 01:43:38.910]  There's major research behind this all.

[01:43:57.910 --> 01:44:03.910]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mug shot because they knew that that would help Trump.
[01:44:04.910 --> 01:44:06.910]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[01:44:06.910 --> 01:44:10.910]  We were waiting for the mug shot. We learned today they wouldn't have it so we've made our own.
[01:44:10.910 --> 01:44:15.910]  And it says political prisoner with an image of President Trump.
[01:44:15.910 --> 01:44:19.910]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas. It will be shipping out to you in one week.
[01:44:19.910 --> 01:44:26.910]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front there in a mug shot jail background.
[01:44:26.910 --> 01:44:31.910]  It's a fundraiser shirt. It says Infowars.com on the back of the shirt.
[01:44:31.910 --> 01:44:34.910]  We also have Alex Jones for President. No, I'm not running for president.
[01:44:34.910 --> 01:44:37.910]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt, red, white and blue.
[01:44:37.910 --> 01:44:41.910]  Alex Jones for President 2024. It's a fun conversational piece and a limited edition shirt.

[01:45:56.910 --> 01:45:57.910]  Please take action.
[01:45:57.910 --> 01:46:02.910]  How many times have you ever spoken to your son about his overseas business dealings?
[01:46:02.910 --> 01:46:04.910]  I've never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.
[01:46:04.910 --> 01:46:06.910]  So let me get this straight.
[01:46:06.910 --> 01:46:11.910]  The FBI was withholding from congressional oversight a document showing that during the Obama administration,
[01:46:11.910 --> 01:46:18.910]  Biden accepted a $10 million bribe through his son Hunter to force the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor that was investigating corruption,
[01:46:18.910 --> 01:46:23.910]  an event that Donald Trump looked into sparking the first impeachment and forcing the arming of Ukraine,
[01:46:23.910 --> 01:46:26.910]  in turn setting the stage for the current war against Russia.
[01:46:26.910 --> 01:46:30.910]  Evidence of the bribe was also in Hunter Biden's laptop, which the FBI also had,
[01:46:30.910 --> 01:46:36.910]  but that they swore was Russian disinformation and infiltrated social media to censor during the 2020 campaign.
[01:46:36.910 --> 01:46:40.910]  All while the FBI investigates Trump for having classified documents,
[01:46:40.910 --> 01:46:44.910]  despite the FBI admittedly letting Hillary Clinton off for a similar charge in 2016
[01:46:44.910 --> 01:46:48.910]  when they were simultaneously launching the Russiagate investigation into Donald Trump
[01:46:48.910 --> 01:46:52.910]  using falsified evidence provided by the Clinton campaign.
[01:46:52.910 --> 01:46:54.910]  Do I have that all straight?
[01:46:58.080 --> 01:47:08.080]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:08.310 --> 01:47:18.710]  We are now in the final segment of hour number two on The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:18.710 --> 01:47:23.470]  I'm set to go right back to your phone calls here in just a moment with more news and information
[01:47:23.470 --> 01:47:27.550]  following in the next two hours that follow after this hour.
[01:47:27.550 --> 01:47:33.710]  Let me just say this very simply, very succinctly, very historically.
[01:47:33.710 --> 01:47:37.550]  The corruption we see unfolding is the way it's unfolded throughout human history over
[01:47:37.550 --> 01:47:38.550]  and over again.
[01:47:38.550 --> 01:47:39.830]  We're in a cycle.
[01:47:39.830 --> 01:47:48.230]  So as bad as it seems, as invincibly ignorant as the public looks, and as invincibly arrogant
[01:47:48.230 --> 01:47:53.830]  and humorous-filled as the establishment is, we have to understand that their time
[01:47:53.830 --> 01:47:57.070]  is short and this always ends.
[01:47:57.070 --> 01:48:01.470]  The question is this time with nuclear and biological weapons and they destroy us in the
[01:48:01.470 --> 01:48:02.470]  process.
[01:48:02.470 --> 01:48:10.710]  This is Fauci that body language-wise puts off the most insane arrogance I've ever seen.
[01:48:10.710 --> 01:48:15.190]  When I watch footage of him bringing out the AIDS virus and the poison treatments in
[01:48:15.190 --> 01:48:20.190]  the 80s and you watch those footage of him, he was super arrogant back then.
[01:48:20.190 --> 01:48:24.310]  But now this guy's been running all the major federal agencies that respond to diseases
[01:48:24.310 --> 01:48:26.750]  for 45 years.
[01:48:26.750 --> 01:48:31.710]  That's 45 years.
[01:48:31.710 --> 01:48:38.270]  And he is just beyond entitled and his brain cells are trained, I win, you lose.
[01:48:38.270 --> 01:48:42.030]  I can lie to Congress, I can gain a function, I can make hundreds of millions of dollars
[01:48:42.030 --> 01:48:46.510]  myself and tell Congress I don't make any money like Hotez does.
[01:48:46.510 --> 01:48:51.910]  I can get away with murder, which he has so far.
[01:48:51.910 --> 01:48:58.350]  But we know this guy's made hundreds of millions off his poison shots, just his piece of it.
[01:48:58.350 --> 01:49:02.710]  And then they can't get him for the gain of function, all these crimes they've committed
[01:49:02.710 --> 01:49:05.390]  because the Justice Department won't indict him.
[01:49:05.390 --> 01:49:11.470]  But it's weird how in the federal bureaucracy, if the law says once you're retired, even if
[01:49:11.470 --> 01:49:17.830]  you're a high-level general or whoever you are, unless you're a president or vice president,
[01:49:17.830 --> 01:49:22.710]  you don't get Secret Service or federal protection.
[01:49:22.710 --> 01:49:26.430]  So just like they couldn't get Al Capone for all the murders and all the money laundering
[01:49:26.430 --> 01:49:32.950]  and all the torture, they got him on income tax evasion.
[01:49:32.950 --> 01:49:34.310]  And so it's the same thing.
[01:49:34.310 --> 01:49:39.950]  It turns out Fauci, since he left a year ago, has an entire federal marshal detail.
[01:49:39.950 --> 01:49:46.150]  Then the federal marshals got asked in interrogatories by Congress, they said, no, we're not funding it.
[01:49:46.150 --> 01:49:50.790]  Now they've been caught lying, and they said, well, someone reimburses us.
[01:49:50.790 --> 01:49:59.870]  So we have a federal agency lying to Congress, saying we don't get money, we don't fund this,
[01:49:59.870 --> 01:50:02.670]  and they're lying.
[01:50:02.670 --> 01:50:07.950]  I mean, crime upon crime upon crime, because Fauci's the little darling.
[01:50:07.950 --> 01:50:13.510]  And let me tell you, I'm sure Fauci, after all the people he killed, is not a very popular
[01:50:13.510 --> 01:50:15.590]  person.
[01:50:15.590 --> 01:50:22.910]  But it's the new elite where now all these people get federal protection illegally.
[01:50:22.910 --> 01:50:27.390]  Just like there's congressional hearings that tens of trillions is missing at the Pentagon
[01:50:27.390 --> 01:50:29.430]  the last 25 years.
[01:50:29.430 --> 01:50:35.630]  Was 2 trillion on 9-11, 2001, they had a conference a few days before, oh, 2 trillion missing.
[01:50:35.630 --> 01:50:40.230]  Now it's tens of trillions missing, and they have hearings where they failed all the audits
[01:50:40.230 --> 01:50:41.230]  they've done.
[01:50:41.230 --> 01:50:43.830]  It's the same culture.
[01:50:43.830 --> 01:50:49.630]  The same entitled bureaucratic culture of criminals robbing and stealing everything.
[01:50:49.630 --> 01:50:55.190]  And so Fauci may not ever get in trouble for his mass murder and releasing COVID-19, or
[01:50:55.190 --> 01:51:01.710]  the poison shots, or lying about the efficacy of the shots, but he may go down for having
[01:51:01.710 --> 01:51:08.790]  the security detail and the security detail, the federal marshals lying to Congress and
[01:51:08.790 --> 01:51:12.470]  saying we don't pay for his detail.
[01:51:12.470 --> 01:51:14.750]  And now going, well, actually, we do.
[01:51:14.750 --> 01:51:18.310]  We're told it's reimbursed by somebody.
[01:51:18.310 --> 01:51:19.870]  Doesn't matter if you're reimbursed.
[01:51:19.870 --> 01:51:20.870]  You just lied to Congress.
[01:51:20.870 --> 01:51:25.190]  So see, this is just, this is how the corruption works.
[01:51:25.190 --> 01:51:28.750]  And pretty soon, if you're a corrupt federal marshal, why should your guys even show up
[01:51:28.750 --> 01:51:29.750]  and work on time?
[01:51:29.750 --> 01:51:34.970]  Because they're already, see, it breaks everything down.
[01:51:34.970 --> 01:51:39.130]  It's like if you work in a company and somebody in the company refuses to come to work, other
[01:51:39.130 --> 01:51:45.410]  people start refusing to come to work, and you say, well, no, Bill doesn't come to work.
[01:51:45.410 --> 01:51:49.490]  It's the unfairness of this system across the board that the public can get.
[01:51:49.490 --> 01:51:50.490]  Like, wait a minute.
[01:51:50.490 --> 01:51:55.210]  You're retired and you've got a whole federal marshal detail, like 10 dudes, five people
[01:51:55.210 --> 01:51:58.410]  at a time, 24 hours a day?
[01:51:58.410 --> 01:52:01.970]  Why don't you spend your own stolen money, you little murderer?
[01:52:01.970 --> 01:52:05.050]  Why don't you get your own security?
[01:52:05.050 --> 01:52:08.410]  But Fauci's a Democrat.
[01:52:08.410 --> 01:52:09.850]  He doesn't support the Second Amendment.
[01:52:09.850 --> 01:52:15.970]  He wants to take your gun, your crime-infested city, where George Soros got rid of the cops
[01:52:15.970 --> 01:52:17.570]  or cut them back.
[01:52:17.570 --> 01:52:23.130]  He doesn't want you to have a gun, but he's got 10 federal marshals, 10, that protect him
[01:52:23.130 --> 01:52:25.690]  seven days a week.
[01:52:25.690 --> 01:52:28.730]  He goes to the grocery store, the movie theater, out to eat.
[01:52:28.730 --> 01:52:30.210]  Five men with guns go with him.
[01:52:30.210 --> 01:52:32.130]  They drive them around in government SUVs.
[01:52:32.130 --> 01:52:34.270]  They kiss his murdering ass.
[01:52:34.270 --> 01:52:40.070]  And then when it comes out it's illegal, they lie to Congress and say, no, we aren't doing
[01:52:40.070 --> 01:52:41.070]  the security.
[01:52:41.070 --> 01:52:44.470]  Well, there's video of you doing security from your own marshals.
[01:52:44.470 --> 01:52:50.310]  Well, we, okay, it's not being paid for by us.
[01:52:50.310 --> 01:52:52.350]  Oh, now you're rent-a-cops.
[01:52:52.350 --> 01:53:01.510]  Lies, lies, lies, on top of lies, on top of lies, on top of lies, on top of lies, on top
[01:53:01.510 --> 01:53:02.510]  of lies.
[01:53:03.510 --> 01:53:08.510]  Does that sound like a free, open society you want to live in, hmm?
[01:53:08.510 --> 01:53:11.950]  And I don't think those federal marshals are our enemy.
[01:53:11.950 --> 01:53:15.470]  I'm just asking them, well, obviously, they're the ones that blew the whistle.
[01:53:15.470 --> 01:53:16.470]  Is this good?
[01:53:16.470 --> 01:53:19.510]  No, it's not good for that little monster.
[01:53:19.510 --> 01:53:26.310]  Play the clip of Rand Paul going after him.
[01:53:26.310 --> 01:53:28.050]  Let's move to Dr. Fauci.
[01:53:28.050 --> 01:53:33.810]  So now we've proven that Dr. Fauci is getting around-the-clock security provided by the
[01:53:33.810 --> 01:53:35.210]  U.S. marshals.
[01:53:35.210 --> 01:53:40.530]  That means they stationed someone outside his house, the limousines take him wherever
[01:53:40.530 --> 01:53:42.250]  he needs to go to the airport.
[01:53:42.250 --> 01:53:47.810]  Why, if he's not in government anymore, would he get this?
[01:53:47.810 --> 01:53:49.410]  So we've been hearing these rumors.
[01:53:49.410 --> 01:53:50.410]  He announced his retirement.
[01:53:50.410 --> 01:53:53.330]  By the way, hit pause, hit pause and back it up.
[01:53:53.330 --> 01:53:58.930]  Rand Paul's had his ribs broken, his lung punctured, attacked in public, shot at, trying
[01:53:58.930 --> 01:53:59.930]  to kill him.
[01:53:59.930 --> 01:54:02.050]  They shot Scalise.
[01:54:02.050 --> 01:54:03.810]  There's like five attacks on Rand Paul.
[01:54:03.810 --> 01:54:05.810]  He gets no security.
[01:54:05.810 --> 01:54:07.570]  Fine.
[01:54:07.570 --> 01:54:08.690]  I don't think we're in the business of that.
[01:54:08.690 --> 01:54:11.970]  He should be able to carry a gun.
[01:54:11.970 --> 01:54:15.250]  But Fauci gets 10 agents a day.
[01:54:15.250 --> 01:54:19.090]  I looked at the documents, five a day, five a shift.
[01:54:19.090 --> 01:54:22.710]  There's like two shifts, long shifts, I guess.
[01:54:22.710 --> 01:54:28.710]  So they're doing like 12 hours a piece, like four days a week.
[01:54:28.710 --> 01:54:32.270]  He's got two shifts of all these armed people.
[01:54:32.270 --> 01:54:38.430]  And then again, back to Rand Paul.
[01:54:38.430 --> 01:54:44.150]  So now we've proven that Dr. Fauci is getting around-the-clock security provided by the
[01:54:44.150 --> 01:54:45.630]  U.S. marshals.
[01:54:45.630 --> 01:54:50.950]  That means they stationed someone outside his house, the limousines take him wherever
[01:54:50.950 --> 01:54:52.670]  he needs to go to the airport.
[01:54:52.670 --> 01:54:58.190]  Why, if he's not in government anymore, would he get this?
[01:54:58.190 --> 01:54:59.810]  So we've been hearing these rumors.
[01:54:59.810 --> 01:55:01.510]  He announced his retirement.
[01:55:01.510 --> 01:55:04.390]  And then somebody said, oh, well, he still comes into the office periodically, and he
[01:55:04.390 --> 01:55:05.790]  still has his security detail.
[01:55:05.790 --> 01:55:07.710]  And we're like, how come?
[01:55:07.710 --> 01:55:09.230]  He's no longer working.
[01:55:09.230 --> 01:55:13.630]  So we asked HHS early in the summer, we said, is he still working?
[01:55:13.630 --> 01:55:14.950]  And does he have his limo?
[01:55:14.950 --> 01:55:15.950]  And does he have a driver?
[01:55:15.950 --> 01:55:17.710]  And does he have a security detail?
[01:55:17.710 --> 01:55:23.190]  Well, HHS actually came back to us and said they haven't been paying for it since January.
[01:55:23.190 --> 01:55:28.150]  But then we discovered that Fox did a Freedom of Information Act, and a judge forced them
[01:55:28.150 --> 01:55:33.110]  to say that, well, while HHS wasn't directly funding it, the U.S. marshals were funding
[01:55:33.110 --> 01:55:34.110]  it.
[01:55:34.110 --> 01:55:38.230]  So can you imagine, we asked the government, are you funding his limo and his driver and
[01:55:38.230 --> 01:55:39.230]  his security detail?
[01:55:39.230 --> 01:55:40.950]  And they say, oh, we're not doing it.
[01:55:40.950 --> 01:55:44.870]  Oh, but somebody else is doing it, and then we're reimbursing them.
[01:55:44.870 --> 01:55:50.750]  So it's a terrible example of the government lying to its representatives and to the people.
[01:55:50.750 --> 01:55:52.830]  But also, why is a retired guy?
[01:55:52.830 --> 01:55:57.690]  The only retired official I know of that gets this kind of treatment is a former president.
[01:55:57.690 --> 01:56:03.110]  So I have no idea why this bureaucrat still has a limo driver, security detail.
[01:56:03.110 --> 01:56:06.390]  And we want to know, does he still get legal representation?
[01:56:06.390 --> 01:56:08.470]  Because I think he may need that eventually.
[01:56:08.470 --> 01:56:09.870]  But he's a rich man.
[01:56:09.870 --> 01:56:12.790]  His wealth increased by 30 percent during the pandemic.
[01:56:12.790 --> 01:56:16.870]  I think he ought to pay for his own security detail and his own legal defense if he needs
[01:56:16.870 --> 01:56:17.870]  one.
[01:56:17.870 --> 01:56:18.870]  I do too.
[01:56:18.870 --> 01:56:21.710]  Senator Rand Paul, thanks so much for joining PRIMETIME.
[01:56:21.710 --> 01:56:23.830]  The truth is, he murdered millions of Americans.
[01:56:23.830 --> 01:56:26.870]  He quarterbacked the global attack.
[01:56:26.870 --> 01:56:29.550]  He's a very important person because he's Joseph Mengele.
[01:56:29.550 --> 01:56:35.870]  And you better believe Joseph Mengele, their mad scientist doctor in Nazi Germany was protected.
[01:56:35.870 --> 01:56:36.870]  So is Fauci.
[01:56:37.870 --> 01:56:38.870]  But I want to be clear.
[01:56:38.870 --> 01:56:43.670]  I don't want anybody to kill him or hurt him.
[01:56:43.670 --> 01:56:45.750]  I want to destroy him.
[01:56:45.750 --> 01:56:47.590]  I want him indicted.
[01:56:47.590 --> 01:56:52.830]  And one day on national television, after he's convicted and had his appeal, I want
[01:56:52.830 --> 01:56:53.830]  to see him hung.
[01:56:53.830 --> 01:56:56.470]  I don't say that vindictively.
[01:56:56.470 --> 01:56:57.470]  He's a mass murderer.
[01:56:57.470 --> 01:56:58.470]  He's an arrogant monster.
[01:56:58.470 --> 01:57:02.950]  We need to send a message to other medical serial killers like Joseph Mengele and Anthony
[01:57:02.950 --> 01:57:12.670]  Fauci that killed Mickey Willis, his brother, that you're going to pay.
[01:57:12.670 --> 01:57:17.230]  And I don't get up here to act bravado like I'm ready to have people killed or whatever.
[01:57:17.230 --> 01:57:18.230]  That tough.
[01:57:18.230 --> 01:57:19.390]  No, they don't like it when we say this.
[01:57:19.390 --> 01:57:23.270]  I want them to know you want to kill me, I legally and lawfully in the system want to
[01:57:23.270 --> 01:57:24.270]  kill you, too.
[01:57:24.270 --> 01:57:25.590]  You want to kill me, Fauci?
[01:57:25.590 --> 01:57:27.390]  I want you to die, too, buddy.
[01:57:27.390 --> 01:57:29.390]  But through the system, we'll do it right.
[01:57:29.390 --> 01:57:33.510]  And if nobody will pull the switch after you're convicted, I will pull the switch to
[01:57:33.510 --> 01:57:34.510]  hang your ass.
[01:57:34.510 --> 01:57:38.230]  I will walk up there and pull that lever and break your neck in a second, you mass murdering
[01:57:38.230 --> 01:57:39.230]  monster.
[01:57:39.230 --> 01:57:41.710]  So fill your hand, you son of a bitch.
[01:57:41.710 --> 01:57:42.950]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:42.950 --> 01:57:43.950]  Hour number three.
[01:57:43.950 --> 01:57:44.950]  Stay with us.
[01:57:44.950 --> 01:57:48.430]  Justice is coming.
[01:57:48.430 --> 01:57:54.870]  With all the craziness in the world, the collapsing borders, the war with Russia, the insanity,
[01:57:54.870 --> 01:57:58.070]  the currency devaluations, the economy going crazy.
[01:57:58.070 --> 01:58:02.350]  You are crazy, in my view, if you don't get high-quality, storable food and water filtration
[01:58:02.350 --> 01:58:03.350]  and self-defense.
[01:58:03.350 --> 01:58:05.510]  Now, we're not selling guns and ammo.
[01:58:05.510 --> 01:58:08.030]  That's for you to go out and get for yourself and learn how to use if you haven't.
[01:58:08.030 --> 01:58:10.090]  And I preach to the choir on that.
[01:58:10.090 --> 01:58:13.990]  But a lot of people got plenty of guns, but they don't have enough storable food or water
[01:58:13.990 --> 01:58:15.030]  filtration.
[01:58:15.030 --> 01:58:19.630]  This is something you need now, and we've got it in the food department and in the high-quality
[01:58:19.630 --> 01:58:21.230]  water filtration department.
[01:58:21.230 --> 01:58:25.070]  The highest quality food, the best water filtration at the lowest prices you're going
[01:58:25.070 --> 01:58:26.990]  to find and still get quality.
[01:58:26.990 --> 01:58:32.750]  InfoWarStore.com is running a special right now for 10% off on all storable food and on
[01:58:32.750 --> 01:58:34.910]  water and air filtration.
[01:58:34.910 --> 01:58:37.550]  Ladies and gentlemen, you cannot beat this deal.
[01:58:37.550 --> 01:58:38.830]  Our prices are already the lowest.
[01:58:38.830 --> 01:58:41.750]  At 10% off, it's an insane deal for a limited time.
[01:58:41.750 --> 01:58:49.550]  Go to InfoWarStore.com and get prepared while you still can.
[01:58:49.550 --> 01:58:55.470]  We have three original, one-of-a-kind toothpaste designed by my father, a dentist, at InfoWarStore.com
[01:58:55.470 --> 01:58:59.710]  that don't have fillers, that are filled with high-quality essential oils and more.
[01:58:59.710 --> 01:59:04.870]  We have the Tumor Toothpaste, we have the Ultimate Tooth Whitening with Coral Calcium
[01:59:04.870 --> 01:59:09.390]  Toothpaste, and we have the amazing Activated Charcoal Toothpaste, again, with a whole bunch
[01:59:09.390 --> 01:59:12.910]  of key essential oils that are so good, not just for your teeth and your gums, but your
[01:59:12.910 --> 01:59:14.830]  whole mouth, your throat, and more.
[01:59:14.830 --> 01:59:16.470]  These are really game-changing toothpastes.
[01:59:16.470 --> 01:59:18.350]  They're very, very strong.
[01:59:18.350 --> 01:59:20.270]  Most over-the-counter toothpastes have fluoride.
[01:59:20.270 --> 01:59:21.270]  Ours don't.
[01:59:21.270 --> 01:59:22.750]  And it doesn't have fillers in it.
[01:59:22.750 --> 01:59:28.750]  It is just chock-full of incredible things that God gave us through Mother Nature.
[01:59:28.750 --> 01:59:32.270]  So it's now back in stock, it became a best-seller.
[01:59:32.270 --> 01:59:35.230]  The Tumor Toothpaste is available again at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:59:35.230 --> 01:59:38.910]  We're selling out of the Tooth Whitening Toothpaste, we've got some of that left, and we also have
[01:59:38.910 --> 01:59:42.510]  some of the amazing Activated Charcoal Toothpaste in stock, but it's running out as well.
[01:59:42.510 --> 01:59:46.190]  So all three toothpastes in stock for a limited time, InfoWarStore.com.
[02:00:06.190 --> 02:00:11.390]  First of all, we have accusatory commentary of Soros, the ace.
[02:00:11.870 --> 02:00:17.870]  Let us not put an individual that is not here, a contributing American, and jeopardize his
[02:00:17.870 --> 02:00:22.350]  life by always throwing his name out in the most ugliest way.
[02:00:22.350 --> 02:00:23.950]  I am offended by that.
[02:00:23.950 --> 02:00:26.990]  Ladies and gentlemen, the system isn't going to save you and isn't going to be there when
[02:00:26.990 --> 02:00:27.870]  this goes down.
[02:00:27.870 --> 02:00:30.350]  Soros does not deserve that.
[02:00:30.350 --> 02:00:32.110]  He is an American and a patriot.
[02:00:32.750 --> 02:00:39.150]  But if we work hard, the globalists won't come out on top of this collapse as the bosses
[02:00:39.150 --> 02:00:41.070]  to bring in a tyranny a thousand times worse.
[02:00:41.550 --> 02:00:48.830]  The problem is that the population is growing the fastest in the very poorest places.
[02:00:48.830 --> 02:00:53.630]  And so it's really an acute problem in a certain number of places.
[02:00:53.630 --> 02:00:58.830]  And we've got to make sure that we help out with the tools now so that they don't have
[02:00:58.830 --> 02:01:00.750]  an impossible situation later.
[02:01:00.750 --> 02:01:02.190]  That's their admitted plan.
[02:01:02.190 --> 02:01:09.950]  I like to call this idea creative capitalism, an approach where governments, businesses,
[02:01:09.950 --> 02:01:15.630]  and nonprofits work together to stretch the reach of market forces.
[02:01:15.630 --> 02:01:20.670]  So we better be fighting as hard as we can and fighting five times harder than these
[02:01:20.670 --> 02:01:26.590]  devils to be affecting the battle space psychologically with the truth, exposing that they did it.
[02:01:26.590 --> 02:01:27.870]  They're the ones behind it.
[02:01:27.870 --> 02:01:30.270]  Here's what they're going to try once the collapse accelerates.
[02:01:30.270 --> 02:01:33.070]  So people don't comply with them during the collapse.
[02:01:33.070 --> 02:01:37.870]  It is about having a world government, a new world order.
[02:01:37.950 --> 02:01:40.830]  They are the ones who will govern the world.
[02:01:40.830 --> 02:01:49.870]  The affirmative task we have now is to actually create a new world order.
[02:01:49.870 --> 02:01:57.790]  There was to be a government by these elites who will impose their rules on everyone in
[02:01:57.790 --> 02:01:58.350]  this world.
[02:01:59.230 --> 02:02:06.030]  And for those who are unwilling to submit to them, there will be punishment.
[02:02:06.990 --> 02:02:09.950]  Now the population of the world is 7 billion.
[02:02:10.830 --> 02:02:18.270]  There will be a need to heal many billions of people or to stop them to death or to prevent
[02:02:18.270 --> 02:02:23.150]  them from giving birth in order to reduce the population of this world.
[02:02:23.150 --> 02:02:27.710]  Because they're going to release a new virus and, you know, be locking people up and promising
[02:02:27.710 --> 02:02:29.470]  to bring back the good times.
[02:02:29.470 --> 02:02:33.950]  If you just take your shot or if your neighbor went away, but Bob was causing a problem and
[02:02:33.950 --> 02:02:36.830]  not going along with it, you know, they're the non compliers.
[02:02:36.830 --> 02:02:38.430]  You'll get your electricity back.
[02:02:38.430 --> 02:02:42.750]  So we, you know, we'll have to prepare for the next one.
[02:02:42.750 --> 02:02:48.190]  That, you know, I'd say is we'll get attention this time.
[02:02:48.990 --> 02:02:52.910]  You're being put in the process of being once free, now being a slave.
[02:02:52.910 --> 02:02:59.390]  Like the Bank of England already prepared their microchip implant RFID chip to be implanted
[02:02:59.390 --> 02:03:00.030]  under your skin.
[02:03:00.990 --> 02:03:06.350]  Um, and why is the sudden discussion about universal basic income from all the grassroots
[02:03:06.350 --> 02:03:09.150]  and inverted commas movements and billionaires?
[02:03:09.150 --> 02:03:12.750]  Oh, universal basic income is the bribe for you to accept the microchip.
[02:03:12.750 --> 02:03:17.790]  The downside of governments being able to track digitally every single product or service
[02:03:17.790 --> 02:03:19.790]  you buy and sell is chilling.
[02:03:19.790 --> 02:03:26.510]  CBDC can improve financial inclusion is through what we call programmability.
[02:03:26.510 --> 02:03:27.390]  They think you're weak.
[02:03:28.350 --> 02:03:29.390]  They think you're stupid.
[02:03:30.030 --> 02:03:35.310]  What we have seen so far, it's corporations and governments collecting data about where
[02:03:35.310 --> 02:03:38.270]  we go, who we meet, what movies we watch.
[02:03:38.910 --> 02:03:43.630]  The next phase is the surveillance going under our skin.
[02:03:43.630 --> 02:03:50.030]  We now see mass surveillance systems established even in democratic countries, which previously
[02:03:50.030 --> 02:03:51.310]  rejected them.
[02:03:51.310 --> 02:03:55.150]  And we also see a change in the nature of surveillance.
[02:03:55.790 --> 02:03:59.310]  Previously, surveillance was mainly above the skin.
[02:03:59.950 --> 02:04:01.790]  Now it's going under the skin.
[02:04:02.350 --> 02:04:03.470]  I don't hate the military.
[02:04:03.470 --> 02:04:06.110]  I don't hate the Border Patrol, but they're just like average Americans.
[02:04:06.110 --> 02:04:08.190]  They follow criminal orders.
[02:04:08.190 --> 02:04:09.790]  Is there a crisis at our southern border?
[02:04:11.070 --> 02:04:13.550]  Senator, there is a very significant.
[02:04:13.550 --> 02:04:14.510]  That's a yes or no question.
[02:04:14.510 --> 02:04:15.470]  There's a very significant.
[02:04:15.470 --> 02:04:16.590]  Is there a crisis?
[02:04:16.590 --> 02:04:16.990]  Degree.
[02:04:16.990 --> 02:04:21.790]  Mr. Secretary, I want to say to you right now, your behavior is disgraceful.
[02:04:21.790 --> 02:04:27.070]  And the deaths, the children assaulted, the children raped, they are at your feet.
[02:04:27.070 --> 02:04:29.310]  And if you had integrity, you would resign.
[02:04:29.870 --> 02:04:33.390]  Just keep pretending, everybody, that we aren't overrun.
[02:04:34.270 --> 02:04:37.550]  You, me or nobody is going to hit as hard as life.
[02:04:38.270 --> 02:04:40.510]  But it ain't about how hard you hit.
[02:04:40.510 --> 02:04:44.190]  It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward.
[02:04:44.190 --> 02:04:46.910]  How much you can take and keep moving forward.
[02:04:47.630 --> 02:04:49.230]  That's how winning is done.
[02:04:49.230 --> 02:04:50.830]  Nobody's coming to save you but yourself.
[02:04:51.790 --> 02:04:53.230]  Nobody's coming to save you.
[02:04:53.230 --> 02:04:54.670]  Nobody's coming to save you.
[02:04:54.670 --> 02:04:55.790]  Nobody's coming to save you.
[02:04:59.150 --> 02:05:04.190]  The globalists aren't just targeting us through the poison shots or the electromagnetic 5G
[02:05:04.190 --> 02:05:05.550]  or the GMO crops.
[02:05:05.550 --> 02:05:10.590]  They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals that the EPA has authorized companies and
[02:05:10.590 --> 02:05:11.310]  industry to use.
[02:05:11.950 --> 02:05:15.310]  One of the top pesticides used is atrazine.
[02:05:15.310 --> 02:05:19.230]  The allowable level the government admits that they allow to be in your water supply
[02:05:19.230 --> 02:05:24.510]  is enough to sterilize you and basically turn your son into a feminized mutant.
[02:05:24.510 --> 02:05:25.070]  Look it up.
[02:05:25.630 --> 02:05:26.990]  Don't let them do this to your family.
[02:05:26.990 --> 02:05:30.190]  We have the very best gravity-fed filter system out there.
[02:05:30.190 --> 02:05:33.310]  Highest rated at half the price of leading competitors.
[02:05:33.310 --> 02:05:35.630]  The Alexa Pure, ready to ship to you right now.
[02:05:35.630 --> 02:05:37.950]  We have replacement filters for folks who've already gotten it.
[02:05:37.950 --> 02:05:39.790]  It does 10,000 gallons before you replace them.
[02:05:39.790 --> 02:05:40.830]  It is amazing.
[02:05:40.830 --> 02:05:42.510]  It's great for your home, your business.
[02:05:42.510 --> 02:05:45.710]  You can put swamp water in it, tap water, whatever, well water.
[02:05:45.710 --> 02:05:47.070]  Almost everything's contaminated.
[02:05:47.070 --> 02:05:51.070]  This is how you take control of the fluids in your body and counter the globalist onslaught.

[02:05:56.190 --> 02:05:57.470]  It's probably the lowest price out there.
[02:05:57.470 --> 02:05:58.750]  You need this filter.
[02:05:58.750 --> 02:06:19.310]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:21.790 --> 02:06:25.390]  Hi, we are now into our number three.
[02:06:25.390 --> 02:06:27.870]  Loaded phone lines about to go to your calls.
[02:06:27.870 --> 02:06:32.350]  Let me get one more big story, a group of stories before I go to your phone calls.
[02:06:34.510 --> 02:06:38.190]  A prominent podcaster sent me this next video I want to play,
[02:06:38.190 --> 02:06:41.870]  and this is Disney television with a dinosaur show
[02:06:42.430 --> 02:06:47.390]  where it shows two boy dinosaurs being gay, wanting to have their own egg.
[02:06:48.910 --> 02:06:50.670]  And again, this is just everywhere.
[02:06:51.550 --> 02:06:53.150]  What is the sexualization?
[02:06:53.150 --> 02:06:54.110]  Why is this happening?
[02:06:54.110 --> 02:06:58.350]  Because they want to confuse things and depopulate the earth.
[02:06:58.350 --> 02:07:06.190]  And then we get Charles Barkley, hopefully we bleep this, out of the bar two nights ago,
[02:07:07.070 --> 02:07:11.710]  saying F you redneck racist, F you people, we need trans,
[02:07:12.910 --> 02:07:17.150]  what does it have to do with rednecks not wanting kids targeted to be sterilized?
[02:07:19.150 --> 02:07:21.790]  But that's just Charles Barkley getting his contract redone.
[02:07:22.430 --> 02:07:25.070]  That's just Charles Barkley getting his ESG done.
[02:07:25.790 --> 02:07:27.550]  He knows exactly what he's doing.
[02:07:28.350 --> 02:07:30.670]  Up there saying, I'm going to buy you all Bud Light.
[02:07:30.670 --> 02:07:32.430]  Man, they lost $35 billion.
[02:07:33.230 --> 02:07:35.870]  They're now gone from number one to number 20.
[02:07:35.870 --> 02:07:38.990]  And I love watching Charles Barkley, who I've never even been against.
[02:07:38.990 --> 02:07:41.230]  But man, I'm done with him forever.
[02:07:42.350 --> 02:07:46.670]  We're not against Bud Light because we're white people and we're bad because we're white,
[02:07:46.670 --> 02:07:47.310]  you racist.
[02:07:47.390 --> 02:07:50.270]  We are against it because it's sexualizing children,
[02:07:51.310 --> 02:07:53.390]  and particularly targeting black children.
[02:07:53.390 --> 02:07:55.390]  If you look at Black Lives Matter, that's their main mission.
[02:07:57.710 --> 02:08:03.950]  But the first thing is this program on Disney television,
[02:08:07.870 --> 02:08:13.470]  Nickelodeon Plus, owned by Disney, here, Disney Plus, here it is.
[02:08:17.870 --> 02:08:21.870]  T-Rexes have a nest too, but those aren't eggs.
[02:08:21.870 --> 02:08:22.830]  They're rocks.
[02:08:24.430 --> 02:08:27.870]  So that's why they want to be around other dinosaur nests.
[02:08:27.870 --> 02:08:30.110]  These dino daddies want eggs of their own.
[02:08:30.830 --> 02:08:32.350]  They want a family.
[02:08:32.350 --> 02:08:34.430]  Aw, they'd be great dads.
[02:08:36.910 --> 02:08:39.870]  There must be something we can do to help them.
[02:08:39.870 --> 02:08:40.430]  There is.
[02:08:42.030 --> 02:08:44.910]  There are lots of eggs that need loving parents to raise them.
[02:08:45.470 --> 02:08:48.510]  And we have a T-Rex egg back in the hatchery that needs a home.
[02:08:49.230 --> 02:08:50.750]  That's right, and two daddies.
[02:08:50.750 --> 02:08:58.030]  So that's Dino Ranch on Disney Plus, literally pushing that the two males love each other
[02:08:58.030 --> 02:08:59.390]  and they want to have a baby.
[02:08:59.390 --> 02:09:02.830]  So don't worry, they'll find a Christian family to take the baby from, and they'll raise it
[02:09:02.830 --> 02:09:08.270]  themselves, or they'll get some lab-made humanoid with their own DNA spliced together, as England's
[02:09:08.270 --> 02:09:08.830]  already done.
[02:09:11.310 --> 02:09:14.350]  So now let's look at the next group of stories here.
[02:09:14.350 --> 02:09:18.990]  YouTube replaces American flag emoji with gay and trans pride flag.
[02:09:18.990 --> 02:09:23.950]  So now you try to find the American flag, all you get is the pedo flag.
[02:09:24.510 --> 02:09:29.630]  YouTube is truly the enemy of the American people, because they remove the language.
[02:09:29.630 --> 02:09:30.990]  How do you even communicate?
[02:09:30.990 --> 02:09:31.710]  Hilarious.
[02:09:31.710 --> 02:09:36.110]  Obama's brother tweets he's definitely gay after former president defends school porn
[02:09:36.110 --> 02:09:36.910]  books.
[02:09:36.910 --> 02:09:38.590]  Well, Barack Obama is gay.
[02:09:38.590 --> 02:09:39.710]  I don't hate him for that.
[02:09:39.710 --> 02:09:44.190]  He's pushing genderqueer that tells children how to have sex with adults and is pro-pedophile.
[02:09:45.070 --> 02:09:47.710]  So I wouldn't say he's definitely gay, I'd say he's definitely pro-pedo.
[02:09:49.550 --> 02:09:54.670]  Obama slammed for endorsing books banning in school libraries containing graphic sexual
[02:09:54.670 --> 02:09:57.230]  content, some of the books that shaped my life.
[02:09:57.230 --> 02:09:59.950]  He then lists books that promote pedophilia.
[02:09:59.950 --> 02:10:06.110]  So he's definitely out of the closet himself, pro-pedo, just like his best buddy, Tom Hanks.
[02:10:07.070 --> 02:10:12.350]  So again, think about how wild this has gotten.
[02:10:13.790 --> 02:10:17.550]  Where these books that he promotes, we can't even show you on air.
[02:10:17.550 --> 02:10:18.670]  They are so vile.
[02:10:20.190 --> 02:10:24.750]  Birthstrikers, meet the women who refuse to have children until climate change ends.
[02:10:25.630 --> 02:10:29.310]  Meet the women that don't want you to have children who want to depopulate you.
[02:10:30.670 --> 02:10:33.950]  That's who you're really meeting, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:10:34.670 --> 02:10:38.830]  That's all this agenda is, is depopulation.
[02:10:40.350 --> 02:10:41.870]  Here's a clip I want to play.
[02:10:41.870 --> 02:10:50.110]  Admiral, Admiral Rachel Levine says prepubescent minors should have access to sex change surgeries
[02:10:50.110 --> 02:10:53.550]  because they might be going through the wrong puberty.
[02:10:53.550 --> 02:11:00.590]  And Dr. Levine, a man who's really gross looking, who wears a woman's outfit with an admiral
[02:11:00.590 --> 02:11:06.430]  outfit and says he's an admiral, wants to cut your children's genitals off.
[02:11:07.150 --> 02:11:08.350]  Let's go ahead and go to that clip.
[02:11:08.350 --> 02:11:09.390]  Here it is.
[02:11:09.390 --> 02:11:12.830]  What would you say to folks who think that they're being reasonable by saying,
[02:11:12.830 --> 02:11:15.230]  why can't children just wait till they're 18?
[02:11:15.230 --> 02:11:17.310]  Adolescence is hard and puberty is hard.
[02:11:17.870 --> 02:11:19.950]  What if you're going through the wrong puberty?
[02:11:20.510 --> 02:11:26.910]  What if you inside feel that you are female, but now you're going through a male puberty?
[02:11:26.910 --> 02:11:27.410]  The.
[02:11:28.670 --> 02:11:29.150]  That's right.
[02:11:29.150 --> 02:11:34.910]  Some creepy dude in an admiral outfit says your child's going through the wrong puberty.
[02:11:34.910 --> 02:11:35.710]  I love the memes.
[02:11:35.710 --> 02:11:37.070]  One of them is hanging on the door out there.
[02:11:38.190 --> 02:11:39.950]  And it shows a woman nine months pregnant.
[02:11:39.950 --> 02:11:43.630]  The doctor's got a stethoscope in her stomach and she goes, what's the sex doctor?
[02:11:43.630 --> 02:11:47.230]  He says, oh, we're going to wait and let the kindergarten teacher decide that.
[02:11:50.510 --> 02:11:52.910]  And you joke about it, but this is their plan.
[02:11:52.910 --> 02:11:53.950]  Oh, look, look at this.
[02:11:54.510 --> 02:11:55.150]  Shocker.
[02:11:55.710 --> 02:11:59.710]  Trans swimmer Leah Thomas comes out as Antifa super soldier.
[02:12:00.750 --> 02:12:05.230]  So a six foot four dude beating all the women in sports is an Antifa creepazoid.
[02:12:06.030 --> 02:12:06.590]  Look at the shirt.
[02:12:07.230 --> 02:12:08.990]  Antifa super soldier.
[02:12:08.990 --> 02:12:09.790]  What a nice man.
[02:12:11.470 --> 02:12:12.270]  Got another clip.
[02:12:13.230 --> 02:12:14.910]  The worst Freudian slip in history.
[02:12:14.910 --> 02:12:18.030]  He thought Kamala Harris was bad saying, well, depopulate people.
[02:12:18.030 --> 02:12:19.630]  That wasn't a Freudian slip.
[02:12:19.630 --> 02:12:22.190]  Dubbed grandmother of transhumanism.
[02:12:22.190 --> 02:12:24.990]  Barbara Max Hubbard, who called for a Luciferian world government.
[02:12:25.550 --> 02:12:27.070]  She says the babies we eat.
[02:12:27.630 --> 02:12:31.630]  She was nominated for vice president as Democrat and preached population control.
[02:12:32.750 --> 02:12:35.870]  One fourth of humanity must be eliminated from societal body.
[02:12:35.870 --> 02:12:39.470]  We are in charge of God's selection process for the planet Earth.
[02:12:39.470 --> 02:12:40.270]  She selects.
[02:12:40.270 --> 02:12:41.230]  We destroy.
[02:12:41.230 --> 02:12:43.390]  We are the riders of the pale horse death.
[02:12:43.390 --> 02:12:45.070]  Barbara Max Hubbard wrote in her own book.
[02:12:45.070 --> 02:12:48.670]  That was 40 years ago, back when they said we all want to kill one fourth.
[02:12:48.670 --> 02:12:50.590]  Now they're like, we want to kill 90 percent.
[02:12:51.390 --> 02:12:52.670]  We're really nice people.
[02:12:52.670 --> 02:12:53.310]  Here she is.
[02:12:55.230 --> 02:13:01.070]  We are the first species on the face of this Earth to be aware of evolution,
[02:13:01.950 --> 02:13:07.710]  to be aware that we are affecting our own evolution by everything that we do.
[02:13:08.510 --> 02:13:14.510]  The babies we eat, the food we eat, the wars we fight, the babies we eat.
[02:13:14.670 --> 02:13:16.430]  The babies we eat.
[02:13:19.070 --> 02:13:20.830]  Is that a golden noose around her neck?
[02:13:22.350 --> 02:13:23.950]  So I want to go to your phone calls.
[02:13:23.950 --> 02:13:25.710]  We got loaded phone lines here.
[02:13:25.710 --> 02:13:27.390]  But let's let's go to Charles Barkley.
[02:13:28.590 --> 02:13:32.590]  Charles Barkley, obviously in a stunt, a stage dealer like, hey, Bud Light's collapsing.
[02:13:32.590 --> 02:13:33.710]  Everybody's tried to push it.
[02:13:33.710 --> 02:13:34.670]  Everybody's saying drink it.
[02:13:34.670 --> 02:13:36.510]  The more that you say drink it, the more we don't want it.
[02:13:36.510 --> 02:13:39.230]  That could be the domino that brings their whole ESG,
[02:13:39.230 --> 02:13:40.990]  New World Order, social credit score down.
[02:13:40.990 --> 02:13:43.390]  But you got to do it early before they get it in place.
[02:13:44.030 --> 02:13:46.270]  So Charles Barkley, who loves to play both sides.
[02:13:47.710 --> 02:13:48.430]  Gets up there.
[02:13:49.870 --> 02:13:52.110]  And he says the full clip's like three minutes long.
[02:13:52.110 --> 02:13:52.750]  I'll play a little bit of it.
[02:13:52.750 --> 02:13:55.470]  He's like, you rednecks, how dare you not drink Bud Light?
[02:13:55.470 --> 02:13:56.830]  First, Bud Light sucks.
[02:13:58.430 --> 02:13:59.950]  And I love how Modelo.
[02:14:01.710 --> 02:14:03.710]  Especially Al, that is a good Mexican beer.
[02:14:04.750 --> 02:14:05.630]  Is now number one.
[02:14:06.270 --> 02:14:11.790]  Their ads are about families and sports heroes and firefighters and police officers and
[02:14:11.790 --> 02:14:12.990]  really everything we want.
[02:14:14.590 --> 02:14:17.230]  It's gone from like number six or seven to number one now.
[02:14:18.110 --> 02:14:20.350]  Because it shows what we want as marketing.
[02:14:20.350 --> 02:14:21.310]  Marketing's not just marketing.
[02:14:21.310 --> 02:14:24.270]  It's who we are versus Dylan Mulvaney.
[02:14:26.190 --> 02:14:32.350]  So here is Charles Barkley definitely getting his contract renewed now with the ESG.
[02:14:33.070 --> 02:14:38.270]  Up there telling you why it's the KKK if you don't want to cut little children's weenies off.
[02:14:38.830 --> 02:14:40.030]  Because that's what they're pushing.
[02:14:40.030 --> 02:14:40.910]  That's what they're doing.
[02:14:42.190 --> 02:14:44.030]  He's like, no, no, you just don't like black people.
[02:14:44.030 --> 02:14:48.190]  So black people are defined by cutting children's genitals off.
[02:14:48.190 --> 02:14:48.750]  No, they're not.
[02:14:49.470 --> 02:14:54.190]  You're trying to define it as racist if people don't submit to depopulation.
[02:14:54.830 --> 02:14:57.150]  Which is the most racist thing against humans ever.
[02:14:57.150 --> 02:14:59.310]  I'm a human supremacist, Charles.
[02:14:59.310 --> 02:15:00.430]  And you should become one too.
[02:15:00.430 --> 02:15:01.550]  You got children, right?
[02:15:01.550 --> 02:15:02.830]  You care about their future?
[02:15:02.830 --> 02:15:04.270]  Stop selling out to the system.
[02:15:05.230 --> 02:15:10.990]  I want y'all to drink this beer.
[02:15:13.790 --> 02:15:15.870]  I want y'all to drink this beer.
[02:15:23.070 --> 02:15:28.190]  I want to say this, if they gay, bless you.
[02:15:29.390 --> 02:15:31.070]  If you're transgender, bless you.
[02:15:32.030 --> 02:15:37.550]  And if you have a problem with that, bless you.
[02:15:37.550 --> 02:15:40.110]  So the new sacrament, he goes on to attack rednecks.
[02:15:41.390 --> 02:15:44.270]  So it's a sacrifice.
[02:15:44.270 --> 02:15:45.150]  I'll bless you.
[02:15:45.150 --> 02:15:46.430]  I want you to drink this beer.
[02:15:46.430 --> 02:15:46.990]  No, sir.
[02:15:47.550 --> 02:15:50.030]  I predict Bud Light goes down even further.
[02:15:50.030 --> 02:15:51.150]  So does Anheuser-Busch.
[02:15:51.150 --> 02:15:55.470]  And I predict Charles Barkley, who's already a joke, is an even bigger joke.
[02:15:55.470 --> 02:16:01.950]  Here's another article, full video at Infowars.com.
[02:16:02.510 --> 02:16:07.070]  Woman poses as girl, bus, New York City healthcare provider,
[02:16:07.070 --> 02:16:08.910]  offering kids trans services.
[02:16:08.910 --> 02:16:14.030]  So the girl calls up and talks about birth control, posing as a little girl.
[02:16:14.030 --> 02:16:16.190]  And they say, hey, how about we just cut your breast off?
[02:16:16.190 --> 02:16:16.750]  Come on in.
[02:16:21.070 --> 02:16:22.750]  So she calls up and says, I'm underage.
[02:16:22.750 --> 02:16:23.310]  Well, don't worry.
[02:16:23.310 --> 02:16:25.230]  We'll come in here and we'll cut your uterus out.
[02:16:26.110 --> 02:16:27.150]  Want to hear the audio?
[02:16:29.550 --> 02:16:33.390]  So see, Charles Barkley, it's not about us not loving the gay people.
[02:16:34.110 --> 02:16:37.870]  It's about the system and the corporations coming after the children.
[02:16:37.870 --> 02:16:40.350]  And now Charles Barkley signed on to the pedo wagon.
[02:16:41.230 --> 02:16:46.750]  He just signed on to the whole sick agenda while everybody else is jumping ship.
[02:16:47.790 --> 02:16:49.070]  That's quite the IQ test.
[02:16:49.870 --> 02:16:52.750]  But they're not just killing us with GMO and 5G and
[02:16:53.630 --> 02:16:55.390]  sterile chemicals in the water.
[02:16:55.390 --> 02:16:56.990]  They're killing us with the fentanyl.
[02:16:56.990 --> 02:16:59.230]  Let's show It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.
[02:17:00.670 --> 02:17:01.870]  There's thousands of these videos.
[02:17:01.870 --> 02:17:07.230]  This is the latest one of black, white, Hispanic, old, young,
[02:17:07.230 --> 02:17:11.470]  literal zombies on drugs that kill them within a few years if they're lucky.
[02:17:12.750 --> 02:17:15.310]  George Floyd was on this, but we didn't make that as cause of death,
[02:17:15.310 --> 02:17:16.830]  even though the coroner said so.
[02:17:16.830 --> 02:17:17.630]  No, it was a cop.
[02:17:18.270 --> 02:17:19.150]  It's his fault.
[02:17:19.150 --> 02:17:20.430]  So don't stop the drugs.
[02:17:21.310 --> 02:17:23.390]  Just talk about white people all day, right?
[02:17:24.670 --> 02:17:27.950]  Charles Barkley, because that's the script you're given to say.
[02:17:29.790 --> 02:17:31.150]  Should I stand up for humanity?
[02:17:31.790 --> 02:17:36.990]  Here's footage in London of a man dressed as a woman with a giant black dildo
[02:17:36.990 --> 02:17:40.750]  in front of dozens of little children ages six months to five years.
[02:17:41.710 --> 02:17:42.990]  Parental discretion is advised.
[02:17:43.070 --> 02:17:43.550]  Roll it.
[02:17:56.270 --> 02:18:01.150]  So ugly men dressed as prostitutes committing sex acts in front of children.
[02:18:02.430 --> 02:18:04.430]  I thought women were supposed to protect their kids from that,
[02:18:04.430 --> 02:18:06.270]  but now they get women to think it's trendy.
[02:18:06.270 --> 02:18:13.790]  Let pedo supporting type cultures groom your children.
[02:18:16.350 --> 02:18:17.870]  Absolutely disgusting.
[02:18:17.870 --> 02:18:23.630]  Here's Serena Williams, top women's all-time tennis champion,
[02:18:23.630 --> 02:18:27.230]  because they had transgender men come out and challenge her and say,
[02:18:27.230 --> 02:18:29.870]  no, no, no, men can compete against women.
[02:18:29.870 --> 02:18:33.470]  And she said, no, men in tennis are a whole nother level we can't.
[02:18:33.470 --> 02:18:36.110]  And now the media is attacking her saying, well, there are no men or women.
[02:18:36.350 --> 02:18:37.870]  They're stealing your identity.
[02:18:37.870 --> 02:18:39.310]  I know this is simple for our audience,
[02:18:39.310 --> 02:18:42.350]  but the general public doesn't get how fundamental this is.
[02:18:42.910 --> 02:18:43.870]  Here's Serena Williams.
[02:18:44.990 --> 02:18:48.830]  He was been joking about myself and him playing a match.
[02:18:48.830 --> 02:18:52.030]  And I'm like, Andy, seriously, like, are you kidding me?
[02:18:52.030 --> 02:18:54.990]  Because for me, tennis and men's tennis and women's tennis
[02:18:54.990 --> 02:18:56.990]  are completely almost two separate sports.
[02:18:56.990 --> 02:18:59.390]  So I'm like, if I were to play Andy Murray,
[02:18:59.390 --> 02:19:03.390]  I would lose 6-0, 6-0 in five to six minutes,
[02:19:03.390 --> 02:19:06.190]  maybe 10 minutes, because, no, it's true.
[02:19:06.190 --> 02:19:09.950]  It's a completely, it's a completely different sport.
[02:19:09.950 --> 02:19:15.150]  The men are a lot faster and they serve harder, they hit harder.
[02:19:15.150 --> 02:19:16.190]  It's just a different game.
[02:19:16.190 --> 02:19:18.270]  And I love to play women's tennis.
[02:19:18.270 --> 02:19:21.550]  And I only want to play girls because I don't want to be embarrassed.
[02:19:21.550 --> 02:19:23.150]  I would not do the tour.
[02:19:23.150 --> 02:19:24.990]  I wouldn't do Billie Jean, any justice.
[02:19:24.990 --> 02:19:26.190]  So Andy, stop it.
[02:19:27.310 --> 02:19:29.070]  I'm not going to let you kill me.
[02:19:29.150 --> 02:19:34.110]  I mean, it's almost like saying a pit bull's tougher than a chihuahua.
[02:19:36.910 --> 02:19:37.550]  Or a mouse.
[02:19:38.830 --> 02:19:43.790]  I mean, we can't have babies, but women can't compete against men.
[02:19:44.830 --> 02:19:47.310]  And it's an overstatement of the obvious.
[02:19:48.190 --> 02:19:53.870]  But now in South Korea, a man who had his penis cut off so he could do it,
[02:19:54.830 --> 02:19:57.630]  went and won the National Cycling Championship
[02:19:58.590 --> 02:20:01.790]  when he was ranked multi-thousands in the mail.
[02:20:01.790 --> 02:20:05.630]  And he did it, he said, to bring attention to the fact that this is a fraud
[02:20:05.630 --> 02:20:06.910]  and it's disgraceful.
[02:20:06.910 --> 02:20:09.550]  Had to get his penis cut off just to make the point.
[02:20:09.550 --> 02:20:11.070]  Wow, that's dedication.
[02:20:12.110 --> 02:20:16.190]  Look at this, Team Canada's powerlifting coach, Avi Silverberg,
[02:20:16.190 --> 02:20:19.790]  just broke the Alberta woman's bench press record
[02:20:20.750 --> 02:20:25.070]  by 84 kilogram category at the Heroes Classic.
[02:20:25.070 --> 02:20:27.550]  Former record holder, trans-identifying male.
[02:20:27.550 --> 02:20:31.550]  See, so it's men to show what a fraud it is.
[02:20:32.270 --> 02:20:34.270]  See how that leads to a chain reaction?
[02:20:34.270 --> 02:20:38.110]  So they don't get the gold medals now because the real men go win it
[02:20:38.110 --> 02:20:41.310]  and then donate it back to the second place, the woman.
[02:20:41.310 --> 02:20:42.430]  Or third place.
[02:20:42.430 --> 02:20:45.870]  Anna Andres had a front row seat as Silverberg mocked
[02:20:45.870 --> 02:20:49.950]  the discriminatory CPU policy by those unofficially breaking
[02:20:49.950 --> 02:20:51.790]  the women's world record in the event.
[02:20:51.790 --> 02:20:53.150]  So that's the thing about the left.
[02:20:53.150 --> 02:20:54.750]  They think they're going to chump us.
[02:20:54.750 --> 02:20:56.910]  No, reality always comes back in.
[02:20:58.750 --> 02:21:00.350]  Here's the story I told you about.
[02:21:00.350 --> 02:21:04.030]  First Korean transgender athlete wins women's cycling competition
[02:21:04.030 --> 02:21:06.030]  and delivers a shocking message to the world.
[02:21:08.430 --> 02:21:12.750]  And for the Koreans to let him in the race, he had to cut his penis off.
[02:21:13.390 --> 02:21:15.550]  Cut his penis off to prove it.
[02:21:15.550 --> 02:21:16.350]  That's dedication.
[02:21:16.350 --> 02:21:17.070]  I'm not going to do that.
[02:21:17.790 --> 02:21:19.550]  And then went and won.
[02:21:19.550 --> 02:21:21.950]  And he's not even a top contender in men's cycling.
[02:21:25.150 --> 02:21:26.190]  That's some dedication.
[02:21:26.830 --> 02:21:29.310]  All right, I said I'd go to your phone calls for the balance of the hour
[02:21:29.310 --> 02:21:30.270]  into the next hour.
[02:21:30.270 --> 02:21:34.110]  I appreciate everybody holding so patiently and so nicely.
[02:21:34.670 --> 02:21:37.470]  And so I'm going to take your calls, the order they are received.
[02:21:37.470 --> 02:21:41.310]  We're talking about the looming Trump indictment that Trump says is imminent.
[02:21:42.270 --> 02:21:47.150]  He's told the truth so far in the last two for January 6 and what that imports
[02:21:47.150 --> 02:21:51.310]  when Trump famously said march peacefully to the Capitol.
[02:21:51.310 --> 02:21:52.190]  That's your right.
[02:21:52.190 --> 02:21:52.910]  First Amendment.
[02:21:53.870 --> 02:21:55.150]  Not according to Jack Smith.
[02:21:56.430 --> 02:21:57.390]  He's a lawyer.
[02:21:57.390 --> 02:21:58.510]  He's a U.N. bureaucrat.
[02:21:58.510 --> 02:21:59.550]  He's God.
[02:21:59.550 --> 02:22:02.990]  You sit down, Americans, and you shut up and keep your mouth shut.
[02:22:02.990 --> 02:22:03.490]  All right.
[02:22:05.390 --> 02:22:06.590]  Don't you understand?
[02:22:06.590 --> 02:22:08.590]  They went to Harvard, so they rule you.
[02:22:08.910 --> 02:22:10.350]  It's a Harvard mafia, folks.
[02:22:11.150 --> 02:22:12.590]  People ask you runs a new world order.
[02:22:12.590 --> 02:22:13.150]  Harvard.
[02:22:13.950 --> 02:22:16.750]  Seriously, that's that's that's the guys.
[02:22:16.750 --> 02:22:19.790]  That's the people that they're bad, bad, bad, man.
[02:22:21.150 --> 02:22:23.470]  They rolled out poison shots against our people.
[02:22:24.190 --> 02:22:27.150]  I mean, they are bad, bad, bad.
[02:22:28.110 --> 02:22:29.790]  Jeremy in FEMA region five.
[02:22:29.790 --> 02:22:30.830]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:22:32.270 --> 02:22:36.910]  Woe to the habitants of the earth and the sea for the devil has come down to you.
[02:22:37.870 --> 02:22:41.070]  Having great wrath because he knows that he has a short time.
[02:22:41.630 --> 02:22:47.150]  Alex, you and I both know Trump is in the way he stands in between them and us.
[02:22:47.150 --> 02:22:50.030]  They get Trump out of the way they get us.
[02:22:50.030 --> 02:22:55.630]  But unfortunately, their fluoride, their jab hasn't worked on the mask.
[02:22:55.630 --> 02:23:00.030]  There's a majority of patriots out there that are going to stand up and fight.
[02:23:00.030 --> 02:23:03.870]  If they take Trump down, that's going to be the last straw for a lot of these patriots.
[02:23:03.870 --> 02:23:05.790]  I'm not saying it's my last straw.
[02:23:05.870 --> 02:23:07.310]  I'm a peaceful man.
[02:23:07.310 --> 02:23:07.870]  There's other.
[02:23:08.670 --> 02:23:13.550]  If it finally gets to that, I'll go down that road when I get there.
[02:23:13.550 --> 02:23:14.110]  No, I hear you.
[02:23:14.110 --> 02:23:16.910]  I mean, clearly Trump's not perfect, but they hate him legitimately.
[02:23:16.910 --> 02:23:18.590]  They hate RFK legitimately.
[02:23:18.590 --> 02:23:20.430]  There's no way RFK is on their side.
[02:23:20.430 --> 02:23:21.630]  They murdered his dad and uncle.
[02:23:22.990 --> 02:23:23.470]  Exactly.
[02:23:23.470 --> 02:23:27.310]  There is absolutely no way they're going to take Trump down.
[02:23:27.310 --> 02:23:28.750]  They're going to take RFK down.
[02:23:28.750 --> 02:23:32.590]  They're going to stop them from getting an office where they can do because they know
[02:23:32.590 --> 02:23:34.190]  that the people support them.
[02:23:34.190 --> 02:23:36.990]  And so they will be the voice of the people.
[02:23:36.990 --> 02:23:38.750]  But how are they going to manage that?
[02:23:38.750 --> 02:23:42.190]  I mean, I mean, Trump has the highest approval ratings ever recorded.
[02:23:43.070 --> 02:23:44.830]  They're going to assassinate him, in my opinion.
[02:23:45.470 --> 02:23:47.550]  That's if they can't get it.
[02:23:47.550 --> 02:23:50.030]  I mean, I said that a month ago on media was like, that's crazy.
[02:23:50.030 --> 02:23:52.270]  No, that's what political assassination is.
[02:23:52.270 --> 02:23:54.750]  When a system can't beat somebody, they kill them or try.
[02:23:55.950 --> 02:23:57.630]  Alex, two years ago, I had a vision.
[02:23:57.630 --> 02:24:00.110]  I saw Trump and he got shot in the head.
[02:24:00.110 --> 02:24:02.910]  And God was telling me that they're going to assassinate him.
[02:24:02.910 --> 02:24:04.190]  It might not be physically.
[02:24:04.190 --> 02:24:06.350]  It could be like you said, politically.
[02:24:06.350 --> 02:24:07.390]  It could be legally.
[02:24:07.390 --> 02:24:09.070]  They're going to they're going to derail him.
[02:24:09.070 --> 02:24:14.430]  He's an unstoppable force that is going to penetrate right through their their darkness.
[02:24:14.430 --> 02:24:19.070]  And then it's going to let our light shine forth because they are trying to hold back
[02:24:19.070 --> 02:24:20.990]  the light that we have inside of us.
[02:24:20.990 --> 02:24:21.630]  And we know.
[02:24:21.630 --> 02:24:22.270]  I agree with you.
[02:24:22.270 --> 02:24:22.830]  I agree with you.
[02:24:22.830 --> 02:24:23.950]  Enables not all powerful.
[02:24:23.950 --> 02:24:24.830]  Pray for President Trump.
[02:24:24.830 --> 02:24:25.470]  Thank you, Jeremy.
[02:24:26.030 --> 02:24:27.310]  Let's go to Justin in Missouri.
[02:24:27.310 --> 02:24:28.190]  Justin, thanks for calling.
[02:24:28.190 --> 02:24:28.690]  Go ahead.
[02:24:29.650 --> 02:24:34.210]  Hi, we're talking about Trump and all the parallels with the JFK thing.
[02:24:34.770 --> 02:24:38.530]  It's like if anybody ever really wondered why there's no answer to who built it, think
[02:24:38.530 --> 02:24:39.090]  about it.
[02:24:39.090 --> 02:24:40.290]  Everybody hates Trump.
[02:24:40.290 --> 02:24:42.770]  It's got to be the same atmosphere that it was back then.
[02:24:43.970 --> 02:24:47.330]  Yeah, Kennedy was wildly popular, pulling us out of Vietnam.
[02:24:47.330 --> 02:24:49.890]  And more importantly, he was calling the shots.
[02:24:50.690 --> 02:24:51.890]  He was the president.
[02:24:51.890 --> 02:24:53.890]  He would tell the generals, no, you don't tell me.
[02:24:53.890 --> 02:24:58.450]  He'd tell the bureaucrats, no, he'd tell the Carnegie and Ford endowment and the Rockefeller
[02:24:58.530 --> 02:25:00.690]  endowment, no, I'm in charge.
[02:25:00.690 --> 02:25:01.490]  They went, really?
[02:25:01.490 --> 02:25:02.450]  You die.
[02:25:02.450 --> 02:25:05.650]  And then Nixon got in later after after LBJ.
[02:25:05.650 --> 02:25:06.610]  He tried to be president.
[02:25:06.610 --> 02:25:07.410]  They got rid of him.
[02:25:09.170 --> 02:25:09.810]  Exactly.
[02:25:09.810 --> 02:25:14.450]  And so it's just it's something's coming for these guys, RFK Jr.
[02:25:14.450 --> 02:25:15.330]  and Trump.
[02:25:15.330 --> 02:25:16.130]  They can't have it.
[02:25:16.130 --> 02:25:17.250]  So, I mean, that's just obvious.
[02:25:17.250 --> 02:25:21.890]  But can you believe how history works that the deep state killed the Kennedys and now
[02:25:21.890 --> 02:25:25.010]  their scion is battling and is incredibly articulate?
[02:25:25.010 --> 02:25:25.890]  Then we got Trump.
[02:25:25.890 --> 02:25:28.690]  That's got to really scare him because they're going to have to kill both of them.
[02:25:29.970 --> 02:25:30.530]  Exactly.
[02:25:30.530 --> 02:25:34.530]  And it's like when people talk the grudge thing, it's like a grudge match between Trump
[02:25:34.530 --> 02:25:35.090]  and this guy.
[02:25:35.090 --> 02:25:37.410]  But come on, they killed his dad and his uncle.
[02:25:37.410 --> 02:25:38.290]  That's a grudge, Jack.
[02:25:38.290 --> 02:25:42.610]  So anybody thinks he's playing ball with these people is just out of their mind.
[02:25:43.490 --> 02:25:47.810]  Yeah, I don't mean he's perfect either, but I mean, definitely RFK is the real deal.
[02:25:47.810 --> 02:25:48.370]  So is Trump.
[02:25:48.370 --> 02:25:49.810]  So how do you see this unfolding?
[02:25:49.810 --> 02:25:52.130]  How do we stop the deep state from trying to kill him?
[02:25:52.450 --> 02:25:57.330]  Well, I think it's the obvious again, should Trump and RFK Jr.
[02:25:57.330 --> 02:26:00.450]  get past all of their attempts to stop them, whatever those may be.
[02:26:01.090 --> 02:26:02.770]  I think it's they have to unify.
[02:26:02.770 --> 02:26:03.250]  I mean, that's it.
[02:26:03.250 --> 02:26:03.890]  That's obvious.
[02:26:03.890 --> 02:26:04.450]  No, I agree.
[02:26:04.450 --> 02:26:06.290]  One of them should be the vice president, one the president.
[02:26:06.290 --> 02:26:08.770]  And let me tell you, they got it rigged against Democrats.
[02:26:09.330 --> 02:26:12.050]  Remember how they I don't I don't like Bernie Sanders, but he was the nominee.
[02:26:12.050 --> 02:26:12.770]  They stole it.
[02:26:12.770 --> 02:26:14.770]  So they're going to take it from RFK Jr.
[02:26:14.770 --> 02:26:16.850]  And I think at that point, RFK Jr.
[02:26:16.850 --> 02:26:18.130]  should switch over to his VP.
[02:26:18.770 --> 02:26:20.610]  That is they'll have to kill them both.
[02:26:20.610 --> 02:26:22.530]  I mean, that is that is an incredible ticket.
[02:26:23.490 --> 02:26:25.010]  So how do they think, though?
[02:26:25.010 --> 02:26:26.690]  And another thing I'm curious about is.
[02:26:27.890 --> 02:26:31.090]  Why did the primary process work in terms of can't they just they have
[02:26:31.090 --> 02:26:34.450]  multiple primaries they could steal from just to not let them get normally?
[02:26:34.450 --> 02:26:37.650]  New Hampshire and Iowa have these special caucuses and things
[02:26:37.650 --> 02:26:39.010]  to see who the front runner is.
[02:26:39.010 --> 02:26:40.290]  Democrats have gotten rid of that.
[02:26:41.090 --> 02:26:42.290]  And so they've already.
[02:26:42.290 --> 02:26:47.330]  And remember, Bernie Sanders won those and he won California.
[02:26:47.330 --> 02:26:48.530]  That's at the end.
[02:26:48.530 --> 02:26:50.050]  And they just said, we don't care.
[02:26:50.050 --> 02:26:53.010]  The electors got together and decided it's going to be Hillary.
[02:26:53.010 --> 02:26:53.890]  That's why Trump went.
[02:26:53.890 --> 02:26:55.730]  Well, fine, I'll get the electors decided to me.
[02:26:56.290 --> 02:26:58.610]  And Jack Smith's like, no, we're going to arrest you.
[02:26:58.610 --> 02:27:02.530]  But the Democrats did exactly what Trump tried, which I think was a little.
[02:27:03.170 --> 02:27:05.970]  I don't really agree with having electors ignore the popular vote.
[02:27:05.970 --> 02:27:07.410]  But Trump was saying, well, you've done it.
[02:27:07.410 --> 02:27:09.490]  I'll do it because the popular vote was a fraud.
[02:27:09.490 --> 02:27:11.090]  But it was still weird.
[02:27:11.090 --> 02:27:11.970]  It was a gray area.
[02:27:11.970 --> 02:27:14.850]  But the point is, Trump was copying what Democrats have done.
[02:27:14.850 --> 02:27:15.490]  Does that make sense?
[02:27:16.690 --> 02:27:17.410]  Yes, it does.
[02:27:18.050 --> 02:27:20.210]  Alex, do you have time for one point?
[02:27:20.210 --> 02:27:20.610]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:27:20.610 --> 02:27:21.570]  That's not on this subject.
[02:27:23.170 --> 02:27:28.290]  I know that you missed last time the big run in Bitcoin and Max Keiser was on you about it.
[02:27:29.090 --> 02:27:32.290]  I don't know if you have anybody that keeps up with this stuff or what's going on.
[02:27:33.010 --> 02:27:36.610]  But the SEC just lost their case against the big one, XRP.
[02:27:37.490 --> 02:27:41.570]  And, you know, over the next couple of years, that could put you in the black permanent.
[02:27:41.570 --> 02:27:43.010]  That's just a suggestion.
[02:27:43.010 --> 02:27:45.970]  Well, we wouldn't be here except for the Bitcoin donations.
[02:27:46.690 --> 02:27:51.010]  And so people can go to Infowars.com forward slash crypto and make donations.
[02:27:51.010 --> 02:27:51.730]  We're very thankful.
[02:27:51.730 --> 02:27:53.250]  I don't plan to be an expert on it.
[02:27:53.250 --> 02:27:55.970]  I had to study all this other stuff for decades, what I'm talking about.
[02:27:55.970 --> 02:27:58.450]  And the cryptocurrency gives me a headache.
[02:27:58.450 --> 02:28:00.370]  So I'm smart enough to tell you I don't understand it all.
[02:28:00.370 --> 02:28:01.330]  But we do take donations.
[02:28:01.330 --> 02:28:03.330]  And I really appreciate your support.
[02:28:03.330 --> 02:28:03.730]  All right.
[02:28:03.730 --> 02:28:04.290]  Here's the deal.
[02:28:05.410 --> 02:28:06.770]  We're going to go to break.
[02:28:06.770 --> 02:28:08.370]  We're going to come back and go to Robert.
[02:28:09.330 --> 02:28:11.490]  And then we're going to go to Joey.
[02:28:11.490 --> 02:28:18.690]  And we're going to go to Daryl and Bob and Vic and Savick's and Carlos and Misha and Mark
[02:28:19.970 --> 02:28:21.010]  in the order they received.
[02:28:21.730 --> 02:28:23.170]  So stay tuned with us.
[02:28:23.170 --> 02:28:23.970]  And please remember.

[02:28:57.490 --> 02:28:59.090]  The globalists are only humans.
[02:28:59.730 --> 02:29:01.490]  Yeah, they have control of the central banks.
[02:29:01.490 --> 02:29:03.730]  They have a lot of power, but they can be defeated.
[02:29:03.730 --> 02:29:06.930]  But some of their operations are going to take decades to stop.
[02:29:06.930 --> 02:29:09.970]  But one thing you can do right now is take control of your body
[02:29:09.970 --> 02:29:15.170]  and your family's body by purifying the water that you drink and that you cook with.
[02:29:15.170 --> 02:29:18.770]  And you do it with the highest quality gravity fed filter out there.
[02:29:18.770 --> 02:29:21.010]  This thing does 10,000 gallons.
[02:29:21.010 --> 02:29:23.650]  You can sit there and put hundreds of gallons through today.
[02:29:23.650 --> 02:29:28.210]  It purifies very quickly and it cuts out thousands of chemicals to non-detectable levels.
[02:29:28.210 --> 02:29:30.210]  This is what I use, which my family uses.
[02:29:30.210 --> 02:29:33.170]  It's the very best system out there for the lowest price for a limited time.

[02:29:46.850 --> 02:29:49.810]  This is one of the main areas we can take control of our lives
[02:29:49.810 --> 02:29:53.810]  and stop the globalists from hitting us with poison that they allow in the water supply.
[02:29:53.810 --> 02:29:56.370]  In some cases, they add the water supply like fluoride.
[02:29:59.170 --> 02:30:02.930]  Two of our best selling nootropics or grain boosters
[02:30:02.930 --> 02:30:05.570]  are now back in stock at Infowars.com.
[02:30:05.570 --> 02:30:08.690]  For a limited time, they're 50% off when you get them together
[02:30:08.690 --> 02:30:10.530]  or 40% off when you get them individually.
[02:30:10.530 --> 02:30:13.250]  BrainForce Plus and BrainForce Ultra.
[02:30:13.250 --> 02:30:14.850]  Two separate formulas.
[02:30:14.850 --> 02:30:17.730]  They both give you good clean energy without the crash.
[02:30:17.730 --> 02:30:21.650]  One is a four to six hour good base of clean energy.
[02:30:21.650 --> 02:30:23.570]  Again, with no hangover or letdown.
[02:30:23.570 --> 02:30:26.450]  The other is a very special proprietary formula.
[02:30:26.450 --> 02:30:29.090]  That's BrainForce Ultra that hits really, really quick.
[02:30:29.090 --> 02:30:29.490]  I love it.
[02:30:29.490 --> 02:30:31.170]  It wears off in two to three hours.
[02:30:31.170 --> 02:30:33.170]  If I've got to work at night but don't want to stay up all night,
[02:30:33.170 --> 02:30:35.170]  I can take it and stay nine o'clock at night
[02:30:35.330 --> 02:30:37.890]  and stay up till midnight working, doing a radio interview or something
[02:30:37.890 --> 02:30:40.850]  and boom, writing an article or writing a book.
[02:30:40.850 --> 02:30:44.370]  And then I get two, three hours of energy and then go right to bed after it.

[02:31:11.410 --> 02:31:12.130]  Down and out.
[02:31:12.130 --> 02:31:12.690]  What's better?
[02:31:12.690 --> 02:31:14.850]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[02:31:14.850 --> 02:31:17.570]  And the answer is different herbal formulas,
[02:31:17.570 --> 02:31:19.970]  different compounds are better for different people.

[02:31:25.890 --> 02:31:27.090]  They're all very diverse.

[02:32:02.530 --> 02:32:03.970]  I want to say brain force is great.
[02:32:03.970 --> 02:32:05.890]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[02:32:05.890 --> 02:32:06.450]  It is.
[02:32:06.450 --> 02:32:11.250]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[02:32:11.250 --> 02:32:12.690]  The fish oil is better than it.
[02:32:12.690 --> 02:32:14.530]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[02:32:14.530 --> 02:32:20.130]  Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[02:32:20.130 --> 02:32:22.930]  Krill oils is the best and it'll give you the damn burps.
[02:32:22.930 --> 02:32:24.770]  And I'm sorry, you want something like this?
[02:32:24.770 --> 02:32:25.730]  You don't get stuff for free.
[02:32:25.730 --> 02:32:27.730]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[02:32:27.730 --> 02:32:28.850]  It's so good in my view.
[02:32:28.850 --> 02:32:31.010]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[02:32:31.010 --> 02:32:33.890]  I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[02:32:33.890 --> 02:32:35.570]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[02:32:37.250 --> 02:32:41.970]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[02:32:44.770 --> 02:32:46.690]  So we don't make a big profit off of it.
[02:32:46.690 --> 02:32:49.570]  But you notice I just obsessed because whatever the best is we've got,
[02:32:49.570 --> 02:32:50.690]  I just can't lie to you.
[02:32:50.690 --> 02:32:51.650]  I just can't do it.
[02:32:52.050 --> 02:32:52.850]  Gimbal or sword?
[02:32:59.250 --> 02:33:03.730]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order.
[02:33:03.730 --> 02:33:06.770]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:07.930 --> 02:33:12.930]  Woe to you, O earth and sea,
[02:33:12.930 --> 02:33:16.930]  for the devil sends the beast with wrath,
[02:33:16.930 --> 02:33:20.930]  because he knows the time is short.
[02:33:20.930 --> 02:33:24.930]  Let him who hath understanding reckon the number of the beast,
[02:33:24.930 --> 02:33:27.930]  for it is a human number.
[02:33:27.930 --> 02:33:32.930]  Its number is six hundred and sixty-six.
[02:33:36.930 --> 02:33:40.930]  I left alone, my mind was gone.
[02:34:07.930 --> 02:34:12.930]  Just gets crazier and crazier and crazier by the minute.
[02:34:12.930 --> 02:34:16.930]  Let's go right back to your phone calls right now.
[02:34:16.930 --> 02:34:18.930]  Let's talk to Robert in New York.
[02:34:18.930 --> 02:34:20.930]  Robert, thanks for calling. Go ahead.
[02:34:20.930 --> 02:34:22.930]  Hi, Alex. Thanks for taking my call.
[02:34:22.930 --> 02:34:23.930]  Thank you.
[02:34:23.930 --> 02:34:26.930]  In terms of the Trump pending indictment, there are three points.
[02:34:26.930 --> 02:34:31.930]  Point number one is it's very obvious what they want to do.
[02:34:31.930 --> 02:34:35.930]  There's no way they're going to let Trump or Kennedy win the nomination.
[02:34:35.930 --> 02:34:41.930]  Now, in the case of Kennedy, they could easily take out Kennedy by having Biden win,
[02:34:41.930 --> 02:34:43.930]  and he's the president, everything is stacked for him.
[02:34:43.930 --> 02:34:49.930]  In terms of Trump, it's obvious there's no way he can lose unless they don't legally let him run.
[02:34:49.930 --> 02:34:53.930]  It's obvious what they're going to do to Trump is what they did to Bolsonaro,
[02:34:53.930 --> 02:34:55.930]  where they're going to legally say he can't run.
[02:34:55.930 --> 02:35:00.930]  They're going to basically say, like you said, the insurrection and he can't run.
[02:35:00.930 --> 02:35:03.930]  And what's going to happen is the Republican establishment
[02:35:03.930 --> 02:35:10.930]  is going to nominate a Republican establishment, to quote Soros when he referred to DeSantis,
[02:35:10.930 --> 02:35:12.930]  someone ruthless like DeSantis.
[02:35:12.930 --> 02:35:16.930]  And this ruthless Republican establishment, who will be worse than the Democrat,
[02:35:16.930 --> 02:35:18.930]  he will defeat Biden.
[02:35:18.930 --> 02:35:20.930]  That's no big secret.
[02:35:20.930 --> 02:35:26.930]  And when this horrible rhino gets in, that's when the false plans are going to take place.
[02:35:26.930 --> 02:35:30.930]  So, no, no, no, they're not going to have Mike, Big Mike,
[02:35:30.930 --> 02:35:32.930]  or they're not going to have Gavin Newsom.
[02:35:32.930 --> 02:35:37.930]  They want Biden to lose the general election, but they want him to defeat Kennedy.
[02:35:37.930 --> 02:35:39.930]  Now, the question is, what could we do about it?
[02:35:39.930 --> 02:35:41.930]  And what should Trump do about it?
[02:35:41.930 --> 02:35:46.930]  Now, in terms of what Trump should do about it, Trump better get a very good legal team.
[02:35:46.930 --> 02:35:50.930]  Now, Giuliani, they're looking to take away his ability to practice law here in Washington, D.C.
[02:35:50.930 --> 02:35:53.930]  They already took him out in New York City.
[02:35:53.930 --> 02:35:55.930]  Now they want to mess around with him in Washington, D.C.
[02:35:55.930 --> 02:36:00.930]  He better get a good team of lawyers, because Roger Stone pointed out he has a very weak team.
[02:36:00.930 --> 02:36:07.930]  And he better fight very hard legally not to get out of that venue in Washington, D.C.,
[02:36:07.930 --> 02:36:11.930]  because that's a kangaroo, kangaroo, that's kangaroo, that's a joke.
[02:36:11.930 --> 02:36:13.930]  He has to do everything he can.
[02:36:13.930 --> 02:36:15.930]  He should appeal to the Supreme Court.
[02:36:15.930 --> 02:36:23.930]  He should have everything he can do to highlight that there's no way he can get a fair shake in Washington, D.C.
[02:36:23.930 --> 02:36:25.930]  No, I totally agree with you.
[02:36:25.930 --> 02:36:28.930]  And the old saying of kangaroo courts in Australia comes from
[02:36:28.930 --> 02:36:30.930]  Australia is all railroads and kangaroos.
[02:36:30.930 --> 02:36:33.930]  They railroad you right into conviction.
[02:36:33.930 --> 02:36:34.930]  Thank you.
[02:36:34.930 --> 02:36:35.930]  Great points.
[02:36:35.930 --> 02:36:36.930]  Amazing, Robert.
[02:36:36.930 --> 02:36:37.930]  I totally agree with you.
[02:36:37.930 --> 02:36:38.930]  Bob in New York.
[02:36:38.930 --> 02:36:39.930]  You're on the air.
[02:36:39.930 --> 02:36:40.930]  Go ahead.
[02:36:40.930 --> 02:36:41.930]  Hey, Alex.
[02:36:41.930 --> 02:36:42.930]  Love you, man.
[02:36:42.930 --> 02:36:43.930]  Love you.
[02:36:43.930 --> 02:36:45.930]  And I wanted to stay on your topic with Trump.
[02:36:45.930 --> 02:36:53.930]  And I feel that the moves that are being played out against him are really just kicking the can,
[02:36:53.930 --> 02:36:55.930]  the deep state kicking the can down the road.
[02:36:55.930 --> 02:37:00.930]  They're running out of moves, and they have to distract from all the other things that are coming out.
[02:37:00.930 --> 02:37:06.930]  They don't talk about the number one movie in the country, a $15 million film that makes $100 million.
[02:37:06.930 --> 02:37:12.930]  They don't talk about what Tim Ballard and Jim Caviezel are talking about when they get interviewed.
[02:37:12.930 --> 02:37:19.930]  They're mentioning the organ harvesting, the blood, the 15 rapes, the marrow, the adrenochrome.
[02:37:19.930 --> 02:37:21.930]  They're talking about this stuff.
[02:37:21.930 --> 02:37:23.930]  It's being left on YouTube somehow.
[02:37:24.930 --> 02:37:27.930]  You're right.
[02:37:27.930 --> 02:37:32.930]  Everywhere the truth is coming out, the deep state New World Order is burning down in front of our eyes.
[02:37:32.930 --> 02:37:33.930]  Absolutely.
[02:37:33.930 --> 02:37:40.930]  And the only thing that they have to get at us is to go after the fearless leader,
[02:37:40.930 --> 02:37:45.930]  the one who, in my opinion, really just keeps his mouth tightly closed,
[02:37:45.930 --> 02:37:51.930]  doesn't talk about all this stuff because it's not time to get one person or this one or a Wiener's laptop
[02:37:51.930 --> 02:37:53.930]  or Hunter Biden.
[02:37:53.930 --> 02:37:59.930]  The only time that it's going to come forward is in God's timing, and you see God's hand moving.
[02:37:59.930 --> 02:38:02.930]  We see God's hand working, and that's something I want to say.
[02:38:02.930 --> 02:38:06.930]  Despite how dark things are and how bad they are, we're seeing record awakening.
[02:38:06.930 --> 02:38:08.930]  The globalists, they're in trouble.
[02:38:08.930 --> 02:38:12.930]  That's why I'm saying they're going to counterstrike, and that's why this is so crazy.
[02:38:12.930 --> 02:38:17.930]  Yeah, and there are a lot of things that he doesn't talk about that other people are.
[02:38:17.930 --> 02:38:19.930]  I mean, I'll say it.
[02:38:20.930 --> 02:38:28.930]  So you talk about Executive Order 13838, which talks about relieving people of their ill-gotten gains.
[02:38:28.930 --> 02:38:32.930]  You talk about who are the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
[02:38:32.930 --> 02:38:35.930]  If you look now, they were appointed in 2019.
[02:38:35.930 --> 02:38:41.930]  Now, if you were Joe Biden, wouldn't you get rid of Trump's Joint Chiefs of Staff?
[02:38:41.930 --> 02:38:47.930]  Of course, Milley was in there, but I think also Pence is a dark artist.
[02:38:47.930 --> 02:38:56.930]  And so Trump and his brilliance doesn't put him on stage to be taken down by Tucker Carlson in 2015 or 16 or 17.
[02:38:56.930 --> 02:39:04.930]  He puts him right next to him as vice president, almost like a captive, almost like he's showing the world that we got you.
[02:39:04.930 --> 02:39:06.930]  I appreciate your call.
[02:39:06.930 --> 02:39:10.930]  I mean, look, a lot of what you're saying I agree with, some I don't.
[02:39:10.930 --> 02:39:14.930]  The fact that Trump knows everything works as his master super genius is not true.
[02:39:14.930 --> 02:39:15.930]  He thinks about freedom.
[02:39:15.930 --> 02:39:18.930]  He cares about the country, but it's not 3-D chess.
[02:39:18.930 --> 02:39:21.930]  He brought in all sorts of folks that were bad because he didn't know.
[02:39:21.930 --> 02:39:24.930]  Once we warned him, he'd try to get rid of them.
[02:39:24.930 --> 02:39:31.930]  So the whole Trump's got it all handled, everything's fine, everything's beautiful is not the case.
[02:39:31.930 --> 02:39:33.930]  It's that evil is not that powerful.
[02:39:33.930 --> 02:39:41.930]  And that if we all take action and speak up and don't submit and pray to God and do the right thing, we'll beat this.
[02:39:41.930 --> 02:39:43.930]  Let's talk to Mark in Utah.
[02:39:43.930 --> 02:39:45.930]  Mark, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:39:45.930 --> 02:39:49.930]  Yes, I'm just going to bring up these two quick points with Tom Hanks.
[02:39:49.930 --> 02:39:51.930]  It was bosom buddies, Alex.
[02:39:51.930 --> 02:39:57.930]  It was a TV show around 40 years ago, and he mostly played a woman throughout the show.
[02:39:57.930 --> 02:40:02.930]  Tom Hanks said that that's where he really got his thought, if I'm not mistaken, was with bosom buddies.
[02:40:02.930 --> 02:40:04.930]  Your crew could look that up.
[02:40:04.930 --> 02:40:06.930]  Now, the other point I just want to bring up.
[02:40:06.930 --> 02:40:14.930]  This is separate because you keep saying things about JFK and the father and and then.
[02:40:14.930 --> 02:40:19.930]  OK, I believe JFK Jr., in my opinion, was killed.
[02:40:19.930 --> 02:40:28.930]  I don't remember some form of assassination because I don't remember ever hearing any plane sound, any body sound.
[02:40:28.930 --> 02:40:32.930]  JFK Jr., his wife, the baby, his sister in law.
[02:40:32.930 --> 02:40:37.930]  OK, they were going towards, I think it's I call it the compound in Massachusetts.
[02:40:37.930 --> 02:40:44.930]  OK, and the plane in bad weather, I think, to come to the bad weather and they died supposedly.
[02:40:44.930 --> 02:40:50.930]  But I don't remember ever hearing a finding luggage, finding the body or finding the plane.
[02:40:50.930 --> 02:40:51.930]  If you could add to that.
[02:40:51.930 --> 02:40:53.930]  That's a very popular idea that he was murdered.
[02:40:53.930 --> 02:40:54.930]  I wouldn't put it past him.
[02:40:54.930 --> 02:40:57.930]  So what are you saying?
[02:40:58.930 --> 02:41:02.930]  In my opinion, if they didn't find anything, I believe 99 percent.
[02:41:02.930 --> 02:41:03.930]  He was probably assassinated.
[02:41:03.930 --> 02:41:04.930]  So what does that mean?
[02:41:04.930 --> 02:41:05.930]  What is that?
[02:41:05.930 --> 02:41:07.930]  How does that affect today?
[02:41:07.930 --> 02:41:09.930]  No, no, I'm just bringing that out.
[02:41:09.930 --> 02:41:13.930]  I'm just bringing because you always bring up you've been bringing up lately the Kennedy.
[02:41:13.930 --> 02:41:15.930]  So I'm just throwing that out.
[02:41:15.930 --> 02:41:16.930]  He was going to run for president.
[02:41:16.930 --> 02:41:17.930]  You know, sure.
[02:41:17.930 --> 02:41:18.930]  He had a lot of support.
[02:41:18.930 --> 02:41:19.930]  Excuse me.
[02:41:19.930 --> 02:41:20.930]  No, no, I agree with you.
[02:41:20.930 --> 02:41:22.930]  I think they probably didn't murder him.
[02:41:22.930 --> 02:41:23.930]  Yeah, that's what I believe.
[02:41:23.930 --> 02:41:25.930]  OK, can I go to my real point, please?
[02:41:25.930 --> 02:41:26.930]  OK.
[02:41:26.930 --> 02:41:32.930]  Joseph Smith of Jesus Christ, the Latter-day Saint, whether you know this or not, he ran
[02:41:32.930 --> 02:41:38.930]  for presidency, ran for presidency in roughly 1848, 1840.
[02:41:38.930 --> 02:41:39.930]  OK.
[02:41:39.930 --> 02:41:44.930]  And he was basically assassinated, in my opinion, basically assassinated.
[02:41:44.930 --> 02:41:49.930]  And he was tried in absentia by the Missouri and the governor of Missouri.
[02:41:49.930 --> 02:41:51.930]  And listen to this for one minute.
[02:41:51.930 --> 02:41:52.930]  You could have your crew.
[02:41:52.930 --> 02:41:54.930]  I wish you would have your crew look it up.
[02:41:54.930 --> 02:41:57.930]  Because that's why I bring these points up to you, Alex.
[02:41:57.930 --> 02:42:04.930]  OK, what I'm bringing up to you is the New Yorker, the New Yorker magazine in 2019, the
[02:42:04.930 --> 02:42:11.930]  March edition will say that Joseph Smith of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the prophet
[02:42:11.930 --> 02:42:15.930]  ran for the presidency of the United States of America.
[02:42:15.930 --> 02:42:20.930]  And then you read the article and it almost matches exactly what's going on with Trump
[02:42:20.930 --> 02:42:25.930]  because they tried him in absentia, which means that he wasn't in the courtroom doing
[02:42:25.930 --> 02:42:26.930]  whatever you would do.
[02:42:26.930 --> 02:42:27.930]  Yeah, sure.
[02:42:27.930 --> 02:42:28.930]  It's basically a default.
[02:42:28.930 --> 02:42:29.930]  It is the same thing to me.
[02:42:29.930 --> 02:42:30.930]  Very interesting.
[02:42:30.930 --> 02:42:31.930]  Thank you so much, sir.
[02:42:31.930 --> 02:42:33.930]  All right, we're going to go on a break.
[02:42:33.930 --> 02:42:37.930]  Vic, Savicks, Carlos, Daryl, Joey, we're taking your calls.
[02:42:37.930 --> 02:42:39.930]  The order, they are received.
[02:42:39.930 --> 02:42:43.930]  I'll host a little bit in the next hour with some other breaking news and then hand the
[02:42:43.930 --> 02:42:44.930]  baton to our special guest.
[02:42:45.930 --> 02:42:47.930]  3 p.m. Central at an hour and 20 minutes.
[02:42:47.930 --> 02:42:50.930]  Owen Schroer with The War Room takes over.
[02:42:50.930 --> 02:42:52.930]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:42:52.930 --> 02:42:54.930]  Please link to his show and promote it.
[02:42:54.930 --> 02:42:57.930]  He's covering critical information.
[02:42:57.930 --> 02:43:03.930]  With all the craziness in the world, the collapsing borders, the war with Russia, the insanity,
[02:43:03.930 --> 02:43:06.930]  the currency devaluations, the economy going crazy.
[02:43:06.930 --> 02:43:11.930]  You are crazy, in my view, if you don't get high quality storable food and water filtration
[02:43:11.930 --> 02:43:12.930]  and self-defense.
[02:43:12.930 --> 02:43:14.930]  Now, we're not selling guns and ammo.
[02:43:14.930 --> 02:43:17.930]  That's for you to go out and get for yourself and learn how to use if you haven't.
[02:43:17.930 --> 02:43:18.930]  And I'm preaching the choir on that.
[02:43:18.930 --> 02:43:22.930]  But a lot of people got plenty of guns, but they don't have enough storable food or water
[02:43:22.930 --> 02:43:23.930]  filtration.
[02:43:23.930 --> 02:43:25.930]  This is something you need now.
[02:43:25.930 --> 02:43:29.930]  And we've got it in the food department and in the high quality water filtration department.
[02:43:29.930 --> 02:43:34.930]  The highest quality food, the best water filtration at the lowest prices you're going to find and
[02:43:34.930 --> 02:43:35.930]  still get quality.

[02:43:46.930 --> 02:43:47.930]  Our prices are already the lowest.
[02:43:47.930 --> 02:43:50.930]  At 10% off, it's an insane deal for a limited time.

[02:44:02.930 --> 02:44:06.930]  All the success that we've had together against the globalists and the fact that we're not
[02:44:06.930 --> 02:44:10.930]  caught flat footed during their major takeover is because of you.
[02:44:10.930 --> 02:44:13.930]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.
[02:44:13.930 --> 02:44:17.930]  I just want to thank you all for buying products at Infowars.com like books and films and supplements
[02:44:17.930 --> 02:44:20.930]  and water filtration, air filtration and so much more.

[02:44:56.930 --> 02:44:57.930]  Please take action.
[02:44:57.930 --> 02:45:03.930]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil which is at the foundation of our entire food
[02:45:03.930 --> 02:45:04.930]  supply.
[02:45:04.930 --> 02:45:09.930]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element which
[02:45:09.930 --> 02:45:14.930]  has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population and there are two things we
[02:45:14.930 --> 02:45:16.930]  need to do about it.
[02:45:16.930 --> 02:45:19.930]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[02:45:19.930 --> 02:45:24.930]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally
[02:45:24.930 --> 02:45:30.930]  keep the soil rich with iodine and we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount
[02:45:31.930 --> 02:45:33.930]  of iodine every day.
[02:45:33.930 --> 02:45:39.930]  Derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the earth's surface, our Infowars
[02:45:39.930 --> 02:45:44.930]  Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[02:45:44.930 --> 02:45:50.930]  Pure nascent iodine stabilized in an activated triiodine form.

[02:46:23.930 --> 02:46:26.930]  left of Superfemale Vitality that's the same formula.
[02:46:26.930 --> 02:46:27.930]  It boosts men.
[02:46:27.930 --> 02:46:28.930]  It boosts women.
[02:46:28.930 --> 02:46:29.930]  It works great.
[02:46:29.930 --> 02:46:31.930]  But women like pink labels.
[02:46:31.930 --> 02:46:33.930]  Men like different color labels.
[02:46:33.930 --> 02:46:35.930]  So it works for men as well.
[02:46:35.930 --> 02:46:36.930]  It's the same formula.
[02:46:36.930 --> 02:46:38.930]  It's an incredible formula and it funds our operation.

[02:46:58.930 --> 02:47:02.930]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:47:02.930 --> 02:47:04.930]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:14.000]  You can feel it.
[02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:17.000]  You can taste it.
[02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:19.000]  You can see it.
[02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:23.000]  You can see it.
[02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:26.000]  You can face it.
[02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:28.000]  You don't have a choice.
[02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:30.000]  You can hear it.
[02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:33.000]  You're not looking for a fight, folks. It didn't start it.
[02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:36.000]  You're not getting out of this without a major fight.
[02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:39.000]  Go ahead. Turn it loose.
[02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:41.000]  Open it up.
[02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:43.000]  Give them what they want.
[02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:45.000]  Give them what they came looking for.
[02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:52.000]  All right, let's go to Carlos in Canada.
[02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:54.000]  He's got a theory on Trump's indictment.
[02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:55.000]  Give us your take, Carlos.
[02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:57.000]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:47:57.000 --> 02:48:00.000]  You remember during the Clinton-Trump debate
[02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:03.000]  when Hillary Clinton said
[02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:08.000]  it's a good thing that you don't control the judicial system?
[02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:11.000]  And he said, yeah, because that puts you in jail about it.
[02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:15.000]  Yeah, well, it has her fingerprints all over.
[02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:19.000]  This persecution is to show him that she can put him in jail.
[02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:20.000]  That's number one.
[02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:23.000]  Number two, she needs him to be in jail
[02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:25.000]  because she can't run against him and win.
[02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:27.000]  That would be something else.
[02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:29.000]  Especially if by then, per chance,
[02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:32.000]  she should be a widow.
[02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:35.000]  Why do you think Trump said a few days ago, sarcastically,
[02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:36.000]  oh, I love Hillary now.
[02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:38.000]  My problem is Biden.
[02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:39.000]  What was that about?
[02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:43.000]  Well, he can believe whatever he wants to believe.
[02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:44.000]  I don't know.
[02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:48.000]  But certainly, she certainly was told by Lynn Forrester,
[02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:51.000]  the Rothschild, shortly after she lost the election
[02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:53.000]  that she would be president one day.
[02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:56.000]  And she had all the backing of the Rothschild family,
[02:48:56.000 --> 02:48:58.000]  of Lynn Rothschild and so on at that time.
[02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:01.000]  And the fundraising was a limited amount.
[02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:03.000]  So that promise is still there.
[02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:05.000]  She promised that perhaps within 90 days,
[02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:06.000]  he'd be out of office.
[02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:07.000]  But he wasn't.
[02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:09.000]  Well, I remember they had CIA guys saying,
[02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:10.000]  he'll be gone in a few months.
[02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:11.000]  That's why they're so panicked.
[02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:14.000]  That's why they've had to, like, totally.
[02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:15.000]  Trump did this.
[02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:18.000]  He made the deep state show its butt.
[02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:20.000]  He made them come right out in the open.
[02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:22.000]  And they don't get how they're like a vampire
[02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:24.000]  hauled out in the middle of high noon.
[02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:25.000]  They don't get that.
[02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:26.000]  Forget Trump.
[02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:27.000]  They're done now.
[02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:28.000]  They've destroyed themselves.
[02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:30.000]  That's correct, Alex.
[02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:31.000]  There is a tendency.
[02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:33.000]  And also in a future program,
[02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:35.000]  we'll talk about this, if you may.
[02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:38.000]  John F. Kennedy's death and assassination
[02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:41.000]  wasn't a total failure of his policy.
[02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:43.000]  Because after 60 years,
[02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:46.000]  he demonstrated that a secret power,
[02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:48.000]  a great, great power,
[02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:50.000]  that could have the president of the United States
[02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:52.000]  killed in the middle of the day
[02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:54.000]  in front of everybody on a convertible.
[02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:59.000]  And that power is what I call the hidden monarch.
[02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:03.000]  Someone had to have the nod to go ahead.
[02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:04.000]  All the other agencies,
[02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:06.000]  all the people that wanted him killed,
[02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:08.000]  none of them had the capability to kill the president.
[02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:09.000]  They're all a bunch of yes-men,
[02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:10.000]  so who gave the order?
[02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:12.000]  In fact, because, of course,
[02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:14.000]  they had the mafia there and the army there
[02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:16.000]  and regular hitmen there,
[02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:17.000]  because they all want to have everybody
[02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:19.000]  in the power structure with a hand in it.
[02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:20.000]  It's like stabbing Caesar.
[02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:22.000]  Everybody in the Senate was supposed to stab,
[02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:23.000]  so they were all part of it.
[02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:27.000]  But who made the final decision to stab Caesar?
[02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:29.000]  I'll tell you in another time
[02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:31.000]  when we have the opportunity to discuss
[02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:34.000]  John F. Kennedy assassination.
[02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:35.000]  Well, I'll have you back, Carls, as a guest.
[02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:37.000]  You're a great guy and a prominent fellow,
[02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:39.000]  but just skip to the chase.
[02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:40.000]  We'll have you back as a guest.
[02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:41.000]  Talk about it.
[02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:43.000]  Who do you think finally gave the order to kill him?
[02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:48.000]  Well, if the order was given by a monarchical power,
[02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:50.000]  it would have been someone who was told
[02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:52.000]  the president has to go.
[02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:54.000]  Well, do you have it all set up?
[02:50:54.000 --> 02:50:55.000]  Can it be done?
[02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:57.000]  Yes, and then lowering of the eyes
[02:50:57.000 --> 02:50:58.000]  and a nod of the head.
[02:50:58.000 --> 02:51:00.000]  Once that happens,
[02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:02.000]  everybody else mobilized to cover up,
[02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:03.000]  to clean it up.
[02:51:03.000 --> 02:51:06.000]  But if you look at very, very, very carefully
[02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:10.000]  at December 20th, 1963,
[02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:11.000]  almost a month after,
[02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:13.000]  on the front cover of Time magazine,
[02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:15.000]  which was owned, of course,
[02:51:15.000 --> 02:51:18.000]  by people that belonged to Skull and Bones,
[02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:21.000]  the Luce family and so on.
[02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:23.000]  This picture was the signal
[02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:26.000]  to go ahead and pay $200,000
[02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:28.000]  to all the participants that took place.
[02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:31.000]  And so instead of going through the weeds at the top,
[02:51:31.000 --> 02:51:33.000]  let's go from the top to the bottom.
[02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:36.000]  Check the December 20th, 1963,
[02:51:36.000 --> 02:51:38.000]  front cover of Time magazine,
[02:51:38.000 --> 02:51:40.000]  and the nod was given to who,
[02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:42.000]  at that time, had the largest portfolio.
[02:51:42.000 --> 02:51:44.000]  If the president was killed,
[02:51:44.000 --> 02:51:45.000]  the stock market would crash,
[02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:48.000]  and that power had to be consulted
[02:51:48.000 --> 02:51:50.000]  before any of this action took place.
[02:51:50.000 --> 02:51:52.000]  All the rest was just execution.
[02:51:53.000 --> 02:51:54.000]  Okay, I'll look up that date,
[02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:57.000]  but tell us who you think was in charge then.
[02:51:57.000 --> 02:52:00.000]  Well, Byron Rothschild.
[02:52:00.000 --> 02:52:01.000]  Oh, of course.
[02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:04.000]  The most powerful, richest man in the world.
[02:52:04.000 --> 02:52:05.000]  And there was an article written,
[02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:07.000]  I believe, by a gentleman called Hoffman
[02:52:07.000 --> 02:52:09.000]  on the very title,
[02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:11.000]  The Richest Man in the World,
[02:52:11.000 --> 02:52:12.000]  I think that was called, yes.
[02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:13.000]  All right.
[02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:14.000]  Thank you, Carlos.
[02:52:14.000 --> 02:52:15.000]  Always interesting.
[02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:16.000]  Let's go to Vic in Tennessee,
[02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:18.000]  then Savicks, Daryl, and Joey.
[02:52:18.000 --> 02:52:19.000]  Go ahead, Vic.
[02:52:20.000 --> 02:52:21.000]  Hi, Alex.
[02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:22.000]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:52:22.000 --> 02:52:24.000]  First off, I love your down and out.
[02:52:24.000 --> 02:52:26.000]  I sleep like a baby,
[02:52:26.000 --> 02:52:28.000]  and I wake up ready to take on the world.
[02:52:28.000 --> 02:52:29.000]  Thank you.
[02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:30.000]  Thanks.
[02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:34.000]  I believe the feds incited the riot on January 6th,
[02:52:34.000 --> 02:52:35.000]  and this is why,
[02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:37.000]  and I want to get your take on it.
[02:52:37.000 --> 02:52:39.000]  Imagine an inauguration day
[02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:41.000]  with 50,000 Biden supporters
[02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:44.000]  and 500,000 Trump supporters,
[02:52:44.000 --> 02:52:47.000]  or a million MAGA folks on the streets of D.C.
[02:52:47.000 --> 02:52:50.000]  They needed a virtual inauguration.
[02:52:50.000 --> 02:52:52.000]  They needed a reason
[02:52:52.000 --> 02:52:54.000]  to use the military
[02:52:54.000 --> 02:52:56.000]  to lock down D.C.
[02:52:58.000 --> 02:52:59.000]  I think those are-
[02:52:59.000 --> 02:53:00.000]  No, totally.
[02:53:00.000 --> 02:53:01.000]  That was one of the main reasons
[02:53:01.000 --> 02:53:03.000]  is Biden couldn't get 20 people at his rallies,
[02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:04.000]  and they knew that we'd have
[02:53:04.000 --> 02:53:05.000]  millions of Trump supporters there
[02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:07.000]  pointing out it was a fraud, peacefully,
[02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:09.000]  and so that's why they provocateur-ed it
[02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:10.000]  and set us up.
[02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:11.000]  We know they did.
[02:53:11.000 --> 02:53:14.000]  Yeah, I think even the complicit lapdog media
[02:53:14.000 --> 02:53:16.000]  couldn't hide those kind of optics.
[02:53:16.000 --> 02:53:18.000]  Social media giants,
[02:53:18.000 --> 02:53:22.000]  with their proven ties to the captured intel community
[02:53:22.000 --> 02:53:24.000]  and all the three-letter agencies,
[02:53:24.000 --> 02:53:26.000]  they couldn't overcome those kind of optics.
[02:53:26.000 --> 02:53:29.000]  And even if they had failed to incite violence that day,
[02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:31.000]  they still had the pipe bombers.
[02:53:31.000 --> 02:53:33.000]  You know, the pipe bombers that they never looked for.
[02:53:33.000 --> 02:53:34.000]  That's exactly.
[02:53:34.000 --> 02:53:36.000]  If they couldn't have broken into the Capitol,
[02:53:36.000 --> 02:53:37.000]  they were going to detonate pipe bombs
[02:53:37.000 --> 02:53:38.000]  and blame it on-
[02:53:38.000 --> 02:53:39.000]  right when Trump pulled up.
[02:53:40.000 --> 02:53:42.000]  Yeah, they never even looked for those folks,
[02:53:42.000 --> 02:53:44.000]  and I think even if that had failed,
[02:53:44.000 --> 02:53:46.000]  they'd have still just used COVID.
[02:53:46.000 --> 02:53:48.000]  They'd have locked down the city,
[02:53:48.000 --> 02:53:49.000]  used the military,
[02:53:49.000 --> 02:53:51.000]  and they'd have put up their little flags
[02:53:51.000 --> 02:53:52.000]  and said,
[02:53:52.000 --> 02:53:54.000]  these flags represent our supporters
[02:53:54.000 --> 02:53:56.000]  who just couldn't be here this day.
[02:53:58.000 --> 02:54:00.000]  I think what you're saying is 100% true.
[02:54:00.000 --> 02:54:01.000]  That's what they did.
[02:54:01.000 --> 02:54:02.000]  So what do they do now?
[02:54:02.000 --> 02:54:04.000]  I mean, they're really biting off a lot.
[02:54:04.000 --> 02:54:05.000]  What do you think their plan is
[02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:06.000]  to be able to indict Trump,
[02:54:06.000 --> 02:54:08.000]  have a show trial in D.C.?
[02:54:08.000 --> 02:54:11.000]  I mean, that is going to be really hard to pull off.
[02:54:12.000 --> 02:54:14.000]  You know, they've already gone so far.
[02:54:14.000 --> 02:54:17.000]  I never imagined that we could fall this low.
[02:54:17.000 --> 02:54:19.000]  I'm really disappointed,
[02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:22.000]  but I don't know.
[02:54:22.000 --> 02:54:25.000]  I don't think there's anything
[02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:27.000]  they're not willing to do at this point.
[02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:28.000]  I agree.
[02:54:28.000 --> 02:54:29.000]  I think war with Russia,
[02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:30.000]  it's already happening.
[02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:31.000]  I think they'll set off.
[02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:33.000]  I think they're going to attack the power grid
[02:54:33.000 --> 02:54:34.000]  and say, we did it.
[02:54:34.000 --> 02:54:36.000]  I mean, they're already saying that's going to happen.
[02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:38.000]  Imagine the FBI a month and a half ago
[02:54:38.000 --> 02:54:39.000]  put out a memo,
[02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:42.000]  we believe the main threat is right-wingers with Russia
[02:54:42.000 --> 02:54:44.000]  are going to turn the power off.
[02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:46.000]  The Democrats are the ones cutting the power off.
[02:54:46.000 --> 02:54:48.000]  I mean, that is so ridiculous.
[02:54:48.000 --> 02:54:54.000]  Yeah, they've always got their invisible boogeyman.
[02:54:54.000 --> 02:54:56.000]  Well, they're definitely crazy as hell.
[02:54:56.000 --> 02:54:57.000]  What do you make of Biden?
[02:54:57.000 --> 02:54:59.000]  I mean, he doesn't even know who he is now.
[02:54:59.000 --> 02:55:00.000]  Oh, he's a puppet.
[02:55:00.000 --> 02:55:02.000]  He's just a puppet.
[02:55:02.000 --> 02:55:04.000]  He's a feckless old fool.
[02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:09.000]  He's the perfect Democrat.
[02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:10.000]  Well, I got to say this.
[02:55:10.000 --> 02:55:12.000]  Trump's not perfect, but man, I got to support him.
[02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:13.000]  He's definitely real.
[02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:14.000]  I mean, he is.
[02:55:14.000 --> 02:55:15.000]  And I'm proud of him.
[02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:18.000]  Charged up, going in, not afraid.
[02:55:18.000 --> 02:55:23.000]  He's like really an example of manly will.
[02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:24.000]  I mean, let's just say it.
[02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:26.000]  Trump's really amazing.
[02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:31.000]  At almost 80 years old, that guy is something else, man.
[02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:33.000]  What do you think about Trump, Vic?
[02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:40.000]  I didn't support him in 2016 because I didn't believe he could do what he said he was going to do.
[02:55:40.000 --> 02:55:47.000]  And I didn't, of course, support Hillary Clinton because I believed she'd do everything she said she was going to do.
[02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:56.000]  So I retreated into my party, and I voted Libertarian, even though I didn't really agree with Gary Johnson on much of anything.
[02:55:56.000 --> 02:56:00.000]  And I had to eat a lot of crow in the year after that.
[02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:05.000]  I had to call up those people who told me Trump was the real deal and tell them, hey, man, you were right.
[02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:09.000]  You know, everything I feared about Trump hasn't come to fruition.
[02:56:09.000 --> 02:56:15.000]  And everything that I was hopeful he would do, he's at least trying to get done.
[02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:23.000]  And I tell you what, you have got to treat a man pretty freaking bad to get me to feel sorry for a billionaire.
[02:56:23.000 --> 02:56:25.000]  I just don't do that.
[02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:27.000]  Oh, it's insane.
[02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:28.000]  And they're going to look.
[02:56:28.000 --> 02:56:31.000]  I think there's a good chance they're going to kill him and RFK Jr.
[02:56:31.000 --> 02:56:33.000]  And you say that's so over the top.
[02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:36.000]  These people are over the top because they've never faced defeat.
[02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:38.000]  And I can tell you, this is their defeat.
[02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:39.000]  Here's the good news.
[02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:41.000]  Whether they kill Trump or not, they're done.
[02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:44.000]  The only question is, will they drag us with them in a nuclear war?
[02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:47.000]  And I've got to tell you, good chance we're all dead.
[02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:50.000]  But I think the Southern Hemisphere will rebuild things.
[02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:52.000]  We'll come back in a few thousand years.
[02:56:52.000 --> 02:56:53.000]  All right.
[02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:54.000]  Thank you, Vic.
[02:56:54.000 --> 02:56:55.000]  All right.
[02:56:55.000 --> 02:56:56.000]  We're going to go to break.
[02:56:56.000 --> 02:56:57.000]  All right.
[02:56:57.000 --> 02:56:58.000]  Thanks, Vic.
[02:56:58.000 --> 02:56:59.000]  Jody and Daryl.
[02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:01.000]  And then I'm going to let the guest hosts take over.
[02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:03.000]  Don't forget, it supports the broadcast.
[02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:04.000]  Plus, it's not going to last long.
[02:57:04.000 --> 02:57:05.000]  Very limited run.
[02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:07.000]  Three-plus years, we haven't had it.
[02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:09.000]  Silver Bullet, highest quality colloidal silver.
[02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:10.000]  Small run.
[02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:11.000]  Back in stock.
[02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:13.000]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:14.000]  30% off.
[02:57:14.000 --> 02:57:17.000]  You want high quality, the best colloidal silver out there.
[02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:18.000]  It has amazing things.
[02:57:18.000 --> 02:57:19.000]  Has so many uses.
[02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:21.000]  And it supports the broadcast.
[02:57:21.000 --> 02:57:22.000]  Colloidal silver.
[02:57:22.000 --> 02:57:23.000]  Back in stock.
[02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:24.000]  Silver Bullet.
[02:57:24.000 --> 02:57:25.000]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:57:25.000 --> 02:57:27.000]  And we're going to keep that at 30% off until it sells out.
[02:57:27.000 --> 02:57:29.000]  I bet it sells out in like a week.
[02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:32.000]  But the big thing is, up to 60% off at all Patriot points.
[02:57:32.000 --> 02:57:35.000]  As part of the Patriot Pride Month that runs through July.
[02:57:35.000 --> 02:57:37.000]  So get your nitric boost.
[02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:39.000]  Get your super filling vitality.
[02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:41.000]  Get it all at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:43.000]  Hour number four, straight ahead.
[02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:50.000]  The globalists aren't just targeting us through the poison shots,
[02:57:50.000 --> 02:57:53.000]  or the electromagnetic 5G, or the GMO crops.
[02:57:54.000 --> 02:57:58.000]  They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals that the EPA has authorized
[02:57:58.000 --> 02:58:00.000]  companies and industry to use.
[02:58:00.000 --> 02:58:03.000]  One of the top pesticides used is atrazine.
[02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:06.000]  The allowable level the government admits that they allow to be in your
[02:58:06.000 --> 02:58:10.000]  water supply is enough to sterilize you and basically turn your son
[02:58:10.000 --> 02:58:12.000]  into a feminized mutant.
[02:58:12.000 --> 02:58:13.000]  Look it up.
[02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:15.000]  Don't let them do this to your family.
[02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:18.000]  We have the very best gravity-fed filter system out there.
[02:58:18.000 --> 02:58:21.000]  Highest rated at half the price of leading competitors.
[02:58:21.000 --> 02:58:24.000]  The Alexa Pure, ready to ship to you right now.
[02:58:24.000 --> 02:58:26.000]  We have replacement filters for folks who have already gotten it.
[02:58:26.000 --> 02:58:28.000]  It does 10,000 gallons before you replace them.
[02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:29.000]  It is amazing.
[02:58:29.000 --> 02:58:31.000]  It's great for your home, your business.
[02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:34.000]  You can put swamp water in it, tap water, well water.
[02:58:34.000 --> 02:58:35.000]  Almost everything is contaminated.
[02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:38.000]  This is how you take control of the fluids in your body and
[02:58:38.000 --> 02:58:39.000]  counter the globalist onslaught.

[02:58:46.000 --> 02:58:47.000]  You need this filter.
[02:58:47.000 --> 02:58:48.000]  Hey, everybody.
[02:58:48.000 --> 02:58:49.000]  Rodney Outbrown here.
[02:58:49.000 --> 02:58:52.000]  I want to thank Alex Jones and Infowars for offering scholarships to
[02:58:52.000 --> 02:58:54.000]  River University.
[02:58:54.000 --> 02:58:59.000]  Maybe you're watching Infowars today and you don't know what to do
[02:58:59.000 --> 02:59:01.000]  with the problems that we face in the world today.
[02:59:01.000 --> 02:59:06.000]  You've been through COVID-19, 2019, 2021, 22, 23.
[02:59:06.000 --> 02:59:10.000]  But here at River University, not only do we show you what the problem
[02:59:10.000 --> 02:59:13.000]  is, but we show you how to deal with it.
[02:59:13.000 --> 02:59:17.000]  Come, a full three-year bachelor degree will train you up in
[02:59:17.000 --> 02:59:22.000]  ministry, government, worship, that you can go out and actually bring
[02:59:22.000 --> 02:59:24.000]  about a transformation in the earth today.
[02:59:24.000 --> 02:59:28.000]  We have graduates going all over the world from the Arctic to the
[02:59:28.000 --> 02:59:31.000]  outback, and right here, this is what we do.
[02:59:31.000 --> 02:59:35.000]  We specialize in training people and equipping them for
[02:59:35.000 --> 02:59:38.000]  transformation, and that's what you'll do.
[02:59:38.000 --> 02:59:43.000]  So scan the QR code right now or go to riveruniversity.org and get the
[02:59:43.000 --> 02:59:46.000]  free scholarship offered to you by Infowars.
[02:59:48.000 --> 02:59:55.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:59:59.000 --> 03:00:03.000]  Take the highway to the end of the road.
[03:00:03.000 --> 03:00:05.000]  People wonder how Trump or RFK Jr.
[03:00:05.000 --> 03:00:08.000]  would be ready to die.
[03:00:08.000 --> 03:00:11.000]  I think a lot of you have the idea, but I'm going to explain it to those
[03:00:11.000 --> 03:00:14.000]  that don't understand it at the start of the next segment, because I've
[03:00:14.000 --> 03:00:16.000]  been down the same road.
[03:00:16.000 --> 03:00:18.000]  There are things worse than death.
[03:00:18.000 --> 03:00:20.000]  I'll explain it when we come back.
[03:00:20.000 --> 03:00:23.000]  Let's go ahead and go to Savicks in Seattle.
[03:00:23.000 --> 03:00:24.000]  You're on the air.
[03:00:24.000 --> 03:00:25.000]  Thanks for holding.
[03:00:25.000 --> 03:00:26.000]  Go ahead.
[03:00:26.000 --> 03:00:28.000]  Yes, Alex.
[03:00:28.000 --> 03:00:33.000]  President Trump, Alex Jones, Tucker Carlson, everybody else, beware of
[03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:40.000]  the deepfake AI deep state God, which I believe is going to be, they're
[03:00:40.000 --> 03:00:41.000]  going to ramp up that.
[03:00:41.000 --> 03:00:45.000]  They're going to start accelerating the deepfakes with what happened
[03:00:45.000 --> 03:00:47.000]  to Greg Reese's voice.
[03:00:47.000 --> 03:00:54.000]  They took his voice and uploaded a report using his voice with different
[03:00:54.000 --> 03:00:57.000]  words, so I believe they're going to start assassinating characters
[03:00:57.000 --> 03:01:03.000]  like that, President Trump, Joe Rogan, anybody that's in our side.
[03:01:03.000 --> 03:01:04.000]  No, I agree.
[03:01:04.000 --> 03:01:08.000]  They've already done it with Tucker Carlson and me, and I've talked
[03:01:08.000 --> 03:01:12.000]  about some of the behind-the-scenes stuff where people have been
[03:01:12.000 --> 03:01:15.000]  spoofing my voice and calling family and things like that, so it's
[03:01:15.000 --> 03:01:17.000]  definitely going on.
[03:01:17.000 --> 03:01:21.000]  Yeah, I believe that's what they're going to do before the election.
[03:01:21.000 --> 03:01:25.000]  They're going to start creating these deepfakes, either video or voice
[03:01:25.000 --> 03:01:30.000]  or something to create confusion, or is he really saying that, and then
[03:01:30.000 --> 03:01:32.000]  get us all distracted.
[03:01:32.000 --> 03:01:35.000]  No, I agree, but at the end of the day, doesn't it show the
[03:01:35.000 --> 03:01:37.000]  establishment's losing?
[03:01:37.000 --> 03:01:40.000]  Yes, it is losing, and we're winning.
[03:01:40.000 --> 03:01:45.000]  We're growing by the minute, and that's the next step I think they're
[03:01:45.000 --> 03:01:50.000]  going to do before they try to kill anybody, any of us that are on the
[03:01:50.000 --> 03:01:51.000]  freedom movement.
[03:01:51.000 --> 03:01:55.000]  So I think they're going to accelerate the deepfakes all over the place.
[03:01:55.000 --> 03:01:57.000]  That's my opinion.
[03:01:57.000 --> 03:01:58.000]  I agree with you.
[03:01:58.000 --> 03:02:00.000]  What else do you think is going to happen, Savick?
[03:02:01.000 --> 03:02:10.000]  Well, I believe that they're going to keep pushing the LGBT agenda, the
[03:02:10.000 --> 03:02:16.000]  acceptance of pedophilia in our states, like right here, Washington State.
[03:02:16.000 --> 03:02:20.000]  With the public schools, we know that they're already doing it.
[03:02:20.000 --> 03:02:25.000]  If you want to go get surgery, if you're in middle school, go ahead,
[03:02:25.000 --> 03:02:27.000]  without a parent's consent.
[03:02:27.000 --> 03:02:30.000]  So they're going to accelerate everything else as much as they can, as
[03:02:30.000 --> 03:02:32.000]  much garbage as they can push.
[03:02:32.000 --> 03:02:34.000]  That's right, and when parents opt out of it, even if they find out about
[03:02:34.000 --> 03:02:37.000]  it, they get socially penalized for opting out of it.
[03:02:37.000 --> 03:02:39.000]  That's right.
[03:02:39.000 --> 03:02:42.000]  Yeah, I believe they're going to accelerate everything else before the
[03:02:42.000 --> 03:02:45.000]  election, so it's a cluster mess.
[03:02:45.000 --> 03:02:46.000]  I agree.
[03:02:46.000 --> 03:02:49.000]  Anybody saying we live in boring times is crazy.
[03:02:49.000 --> 03:02:52.000]  I mean, Savick, is this not a crazy time to be alive?
[03:02:53.000 --> 03:03:02.000]  It is crazy, amazing, and we're living in the prophecies that our ancestors
[03:03:02.000 --> 03:03:07.000]  predicted thousands of years ago, and if you don't really see it, then
[03:03:07.000 --> 03:03:09.000]  you're still asleep by the wheel.
[03:03:09.000 --> 03:03:11.000]  Absolutely, I totally agree.
[03:03:11.000 --> 03:03:15.000]  We're living in, like, radars bouncing out in the future thousands of years
[03:03:15.000 --> 03:03:18.000]  ago, or sonar, spiritual sonar picks it up.
[03:03:18.000 --> 03:03:21.000]  Now, we're not getting the sonar pings back thousands of years.
[03:03:21.000 --> 03:03:24.000]  We're now seeing the target with our own eyeballs.
[03:03:24.000 --> 03:03:29.000]  We're now over it, and so we are going to get front row seats.
[03:03:29.000 --> 03:03:31.000]  We'll go to break, come back with Darrell.
[03:03:31.000 --> 03:03:34.000]  Thank you, Savick, and Joey, and then I'm going to hand the baton to our
[03:03:34.000 --> 03:03:38.000]  special guest host, but I'm not going to spend a lot of time on this, but,
[03:03:38.000 --> 03:03:41.000]  I mean, I really was thinking about why is RFK Jr.
[03:03:41.000 --> 03:03:42.000]  willing to die?
[03:03:42.000 --> 03:03:44.000]  Why is Trump willing to die?
[03:03:44.000 --> 03:03:48.000]  And why Trump, particularly in the face of all these threats and prison and
[03:03:48.000 --> 03:03:50.000]  death, why is he so confident?
[03:03:50.000 --> 03:03:51.000]  And it's the same reason Robert F.
[03:03:51.000 --> 03:03:52.000]  Kennedy's confident.
[03:03:52.000 --> 03:03:54.000]  He was there when his dad was gunned down and murdered.
[03:03:54.000 --> 03:03:56.000]  He was there when his dad died, holding his hand.
[03:03:56.000 --> 03:04:01.000]  Before that, he watched his uncle murdered on television, the president,
[03:04:01.000 --> 03:04:04.000]  and you just realize there are things worse than death.
[03:04:04.000 --> 03:04:07.000]  You just realize, like, I'm not going to bow down.
[03:04:07.000 --> 03:04:08.000]  I'm not going to be these people's slave.
[03:04:08.000 --> 03:04:15.000]  I have to stand against them, and I have to call them out on the fact that
[03:04:15.000 --> 03:04:20.000]  they want to intimidate me and just let them know that, in the end,
[03:04:20.000 --> 03:04:23.000]  they're going to go down, and they will go down.
[03:04:23.000 --> 03:04:26.000]  This country's been hijacked by covert intelligence agencies since the end
[03:04:26.000 --> 03:04:27.000]  of World War II.
[03:04:27.000 --> 03:04:30.000]  British intelligence basically involved running it.
[03:04:30.000 --> 03:04:32.000]  I'm not blaming the British, but it's that model.
[03:04:32.000 --> 03:04:36.000]  And they've run the country in the ground, and they've got to be stopped,
[03:04:36.000 --> 03:04:38.000]  and a lot of us won't make it in the fight, but in the end,
[03:04:38.000 --> 03:04:40.000]  these guys will be removed.
[03:04:40.000 --> 03:04:41.000]  They will be dealt with.
[03:04:41.000 --> 03:04:43.000]  They will be crushed.
[03:04:43.000 --> 03:04:47.000]  Back in 60 seconds for two final calls as Maria Z. from Australia takes over.
[03:04:47.000 --> 03:04:50.000]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[03:04:50.000 --> 03:04:52.000]  Tomorrow's news today.
[03:04:57.000 --> 03:05:00.000]  How many times have you ever spoken to your son about his
[03:05:00.000 --> 03:05:02.000]  overseas business dealings?
[03:05:02.000 --> 03:05:04.000]  I've never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.
[03:05:04.000 --> 03:05:06.000]  So let me get this straight.
[03:05:06.000 --> 03:05:10.000]  The FBI was withholding from congressional oversight a document showing that
[03:05:10.000 --> 03:05:13.000]  during the Obama administration, Biden accepted a $10 million bribe
[03:05:13.000 --> 03:05:16.000]  through his son Hunter to force the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor
[03:05:16.000 --> 03:05:20.000]  that was investigating corruption, an event that Donald Trump looked into,
[03:05:20.000 --> 03:05:23.000]  sparking the first impeachment and forcing the arming of Ukraine,
[03:05:23.000 --> 03:05:26.000]  in turn setting the stage for the current war against Russia.
[03:05:26.000 --> 03:05:30.000]  Evidence of the bribe was also in Hunter Biden's laptop, which the FBI
[03:05:30.000 --> 03:05:33.000]  also had, but that they swore was Russian disinformation and infiltrated
[03:05:33.000 --> 03:05:38.000]  social media to censor during the 2020 campaign, all while the FBI
[03:05:38.000 --> 03:05:41.000]  investigates Trump for having classified documents, despite the FBI
[03:05:41.000 --> 03:05:44.000]  admittedly letting Hillary Clinton off for a similar charge in 2016,
[03:05:44.000 --> 03:05:47.000]  when they were simultaneously launching the Russiagate investigation
[03:05:47.000 --> 03:05:52.000]  into Donald Trump using falsified evidence provided by the Clinton campaign.
[03:05:52.000 --> 03:05:54.000]  Do I have that all straight?
[03:06:08.000 --> 03:06:13.000]  Why would President Trump, why would Robert F. Kennedy Jr.,
[03:06:13.000 --> 03:06:18.000]  who both know the deep state, the corrupt, entitled bureaucracy is gunning for,
[03:06:18.000 --> 03:06:21.000]  they're trying to put him in prison, trying to kill him, trying to destroy him,
[03:06:21.000 --> 03:06:23.000]  still have the courage to fight?
[03:06:23.000 --> 03:06:27.000]  Because submitting to these tyrants is worse than death.
[03:06:27.000 --> 03:06:32.000]  It's turning your soul and your will over to these horrible people
[03:06:32.000 --> 03:06:37.000]  that are carrying out these incredibly destructive agendas against the children,
[03:06:37.000 --> 03:06:41.000]  against the women, against the men, against culture and society.
[03:06:41.000 --> 03:06:46.000]  It is a genetic, spiritual will to build something better and to not be slaves
[03:06:46.000 --> 03:06:53.000]  that demands, that commands, that compels us to do the right thing,
[03:06:53.000 --> 03:07:00.000]  and that's why I don't fear death, I don't fear prison, I don't fear being destroyed.
[03:07:00.000 --> 03:07:03.000]  I certainly want to keep working and keep fighting and spending time with my family,
[03:07:03.000 --> 03:07:06.000]  but at the end of the day, I know I can't ever stop.
[03:07:06.000 --> 03:07:10.000]  There's not even 1% of me that wants to give up or give in,
[03:07:10.000 --> 03:07:12.000]  because I understand the larger mission.
[03:07:12.000 --> 03:07:15.000]  I get frustrated by prosecuting the war against the globalists,
[03:07:15.000 --> 03:07:19.000]  and I get frustrated by my own weakness and other people's weakness around me,
[03:07:19.000 --> 03:07:23.000]  but at the end of the day, there's no discussion of quitting out of fear.
[03:07:23.000 --> 03:07:27.000]  Sometimes you're like, well, I've kind of run my course and already put in my fight,
[03:07:27.000 --> 03:07:31.000]  and so it's now up to others to finish the fight, but it's like the movie The Patriot,
[03:07:31.000 --> 03:07:35.000]  based on a composite, two stories after his son dies, his second son dies,
[03:07:35.000 --> 03:07:38.000]  and he's been to the war for five, six years, and he just says,
[03:07:38.000 --> 03:07:41.000]  it's up to other people now, I'm going to go home and just,
[03:07:41.000 --> 03:07:46.000]  and then he sees the flag that his son had carried, and remembers what he did,
[03:07:46.000 --> 03:07:50.000]  his dedication, he says, too many people have died for this.
[03:07:50.000 --> 03:07:55.000]  Too many people have struggled, and everything they built, taken from them,
[03:07:55.000 --> 03:07:59.000]  for us to then act like half measures are the only way.
[03:07:59.000 --> 03:08:02.000]  No, it's because our enemy is so bad they've got to be beaten.
[03:08:02.000 --> 03:08:05.000]  It's because they are so evil and sick that we've got to go all the way
[03:08:05.000 --> 03:08:09.000]  and never give up and put our full energy against them.
[03:08:09.000 --> 03:08:13.000]  That's what God's looking for, total commitment,
[03:08:13.000 --> 03:08:17.000]  and only total commitment will beat these people.
[03:08:17.000 --> 03:08:21.000]  And they will be beaten, but we don't beat them to prove we're better than them.
[03:08:21.000 --> 03:08:22.000]  We know they're better than them.
[03:08:22.000 --> 03:08:28.000]  We beat them because the children are counting on us to build a real future world for them,
[03:08:28.000 --> 03:08:30.000]  just as we stand on the shoulders of the men and women that came before us
[03:08:30.000 --> 03:08:34.000]  and sacrificed everything, we're going to do that now in this fight
[03:08:34.000 --> 03:08:38.000]  and complete that circle into the future.
[03:08:38.000 --> 03:08:42.000]  All right, Joey in North Carolina, thanks for holding her on the air.
[03:08:42.000 --> 03:08:43.000]  Go ahead.
[03:08:43.000 --> 03:08:49.000]  Hey, I completely agree with you that evil has no power
[03:08:49.000 --> 03:08:53.000]  because evil has already been destroyed by my father.
[03:08:54.000 --> 03:09:00.000]  He sent the Son, Jesus Christ, to destroy sin and to destroy death,
[03:09:00.000 --> 03:09:04.000]  and people are still sinning, and people are still dead.
[03:09:04.000 --> 03:09:08.000]  So I'm here to tell you that all of this would not be happening
[03:09:08.000 --> 03:09:13.000]  if people simply died with me as I did on the cross,
[03:09:13.000 --> 03:09:18.000]  and my Father in Heaven would resurrect you with me into eternal life.
[03:09:18.000 --> 03:09:24.000]  So are you speaking second or third person as Christ, or are you saying you are Christ?
[03:09:24.000 --> 03:09:26.000]  If you knew me, you would abide in my love.
[03:09:26.000 --> 03:09:28.000]  Joey, I appreciate your call.
[03:09:28.000 --> 03:09:30.000]  I appreciate it.
[03:09:30.000 --> 03:09:31.000]  I believe in Christ.
[03:09:31.000 --> 03:09:33.000]  I believe what you're saying, but you're not Christ.
[03:09:33.000 --> 03:09:35.000]  Let's talk to Darrell in North Carolina.
[03:09:35.000 --> 03:09:36.000]  You're on the air.
[03:09:36.000 --> 03:09:37.000]  Welcome.
[03:09:37.000 --> 03:09:38.000]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:09:38.000 --> 03:09:41.000]  Wow, for the last caller.
[03:09:41.000 --> 03:09:43.000]  I want to talk about the Trump indictment
[03:09:44.000 --> 03:09:48.000]  and some potential offensive game plans that we can take,
[03:09:48.000 --> 03:09:53.000]  not only Trump but others who are being persecuted by this D.C. court.
[03:09:53.000 --> 03:09:55.000]  So my question is this.
[03:09:55.000 --> 03:09:59.000]  If the courts are criminal and evil, and you know that,
[03:09:59.000 --> 03:10:01.000]  and you're going to go get sentenced,
[03:10:01.000 --> 03:10:04.000]  do you martyr yourself and just take the sentence,
[03:10:04.000 --> 03:10:12.000]  or do you maybe become a fugitive, thus maybe becoming an American hero or a folk legend?
[03:10:12.000 --> 03:10:16.000]  Now, you know, I might want to do that, man.
[03:10:16.000 --> 03:10:22.000]  I could go hang out in the Appalachian Mountains with my satellite 123 phone,
[03:10:22.000 --> 03:10:25.000]  and, shoot, I might even call in the InfoWars every couple of weeks
[03:10:25.000 --> 03:10:29.000]  and update everybody on how it's going.
[03:10:29.000 --> 03:10:34.000]  I mean, in the past, if Trump ran off to some undisclosed location,
[03:10:34.000 --> 03:10:36.000]  they'd say, oh, he's a coward.
[03:10:36.000 --> 03:10:39.000]  No, I mean, this system is so discredited, who knows?
[03:10:39.000 --> 03:10:41.000]  I mean, I hear what you're saying.
[03:10:41.000 --> 03:10:43.000]  It's definitely crazy times.
[03:10:43.000 --> 03:10:46.000]  Yeah, like, you know, if noncompliance is the answer,
[03:10:46.000 --> 03:10:52.000]  then not complying with the criminal kangaroo court seems to be the next logical step
[03:10:52.000 --> 03:10:55.000]  for an American that's being ruled out.
[03:10:55.000 --> 03:10:57.000]  Well, I think the way to do it is what Congress is talking about,
[03:10:57.000 --> 03:11:00.000]  impeaching the attorney general and these judges.
[03:11:00.000 --> 03:11:02.000]  Yes, if they can do it.
[03:11:02.000 --> 03:11:06.000]  But, I mean, do you see McCarthy today when he's asked about the Trump indictment?
[03:11:06.000 --> 03:11:07.000]  Total jello.
[03:11:07.000 --> 03:11:08.000]  I mean, nothing.
[03:11:08.000 --> 03:11:12.000]  I don't think any of these politicians are going to do anything
[03:11:12.000 --> 03:11:15.000]  except jockey for a position in the new world order.
[03:11:15.000 --> 03:11:16.000]  No, I hear you.
[03:11:16.000 --> 03:11:18.000]  That's why they were chosen.
[03:11:18.000 --> 03:11:19.000]  I didn't see what McCarthy said.
[03:11:19.000 --> 03:11:21.000]  What happened?
[03:11:21.000 --> 03:11:24.000]  He gave a quick 30-second spiel on, you know,
[03:11:24.000 --> 03:11:25.000]  what do you think about the Trump indictment?
[03:11:25.000 --> 03:11:28.000]  Oh, well, gosh, they sure shouldn't be doing that.
[03:11:28.000 --> 03:11:29.000]  I'm real mad about that.
[03:11:29.000 --> 03:11:31.000]  You know, this is not right.
[03:11:31.000 --> 03:11:33.000]  Just the same old finalists.
[03:11:33.000 --> 03:11:35.000]  There's nothing there.
[03:11:35.000 --> 03:11:38.000]  It's like they're all just playing us for fools.
[03:11:38.000 --> 03:11:40.000]  And we need to go on the offensive.
[03:11:40.000 --> 03:11:43.000]  And all I'm saying is, is it time for another Tea Party?
[03:11:43.000 --> 03:11:45.000]  And all we do is just say, you know what?
[03:11:45.000 --> 03:11:50.000]  I'm not going to comply with your, you know, if you get sentenced.
[03:11:50.000 --> 03:11:52.000]  If they say, hey, we're going to put you in for five years.
[03:11:52.000 --> 03:11:53.000]  Well, why?
[03:11:53.000 --> 03:11:54.000]  Why comply with that?
[03:11:54.000 --> 03:11:56.000]  Unless you want to be a martyr, and that's the way to do it.
[03:11:56.000 --> 03:11:57.000]  Hey, be a martyr.
[03:11:57.000 --> 03:11:59.000]  Or don't.
[03:11:59.000 --> 03:12:00.000]  Do something else.
[03:12:00.000 --> 03:12:01.000]  I'm just coming up with an idea.
[03:12:01.000 --> 03:12:02.000]  And I would help out.
[03:12:02.000 --> 03:12:03.000]  Because you know what?
[03:12:03.000 --> 03:12:07.000]  If you harbor a fugitive, I think you get a bigger sentence than the fugitive.
[03:12:07.000 --> 03:12:09.000]  So actually, the one harboring is really sticking.
[03:12:09.000 --> 03:12:12.000]  Yeah, but I mean, Trump can, like, go to Saudi Arabia or something.
[03:12:12.000 --> 03:12:14.000]  Russia's already inviting him over there.
[03:12:14.000 --> 03:12:16.000]  But the obvious wouldn't be right on that.
[03:12:16.000 --> 03:12:17.000]  All right, Darrell, I hear your point.
[03:12:17.000 --> 03:12:19.000]  I really appreciate you.
[03:12:19.000 --> 03:12:22.000]  All right, Maria Z, great talk show host out of Australia.
[03:12:22.000 --> 03:12:25.000]  Z Media, Z-E-E-E, media.com.
[03:12:25.000 --> 03:12:27.000]  She's been fighting with tyranny over there.
[03:12:27.000 --> 03:12:28.000]  They're planning more lockdowns here.
[03:12:28.000 --> 03:12:30.000]  It's the same globalist army we're facing.
[03:12:30.000 --> 03:12:31.000]  Look forward to her insight.
[03:12:31.000 --> 03:12:32.000]  Maria Z, thanks for being here.
[03:12:32.000 --> 03:12:33.000]  Take over.
[03:12:33.000 --> 03:12:35.000]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[03:12:35.000 --> 03:12:40.000]  We are all so, so grateful for all of your years of service and waking up the world.
[03:12:40.000 --> 03:12:46.000]  It is because of Alex Jones and Infowars that so many people are waking up to the truth.
[03:12:46.000 --> 03:12:51.000]  And we have made so much progress, so much progress in people realizing.
[03:12:51.000 --> 03:12:55.000]  You know, just the other day, Alex was talking about a real-life vampire.
[03:12:55.000 --> 03:12:59.000]  Back maybe 10 years ago, some people would have thought, that's crazy.
[03:12:59.000 --> 03:13:04.000]  Maybe 10 years on, a lot of people are saying, yeah, wow, this stuff really does exist.
[03:13:04.000 --> 03:13:10.000]  And so the topic that we're going to be covering today with my special guest is no less crazy
[03:13:10.000 --> 03:13:14.000]  than all of the other things that have come out to be true.
[03:13:14.000 --> 03:13:18.000]  She's one of the most comprehensive researchers that I know on the topics of synthetic biology,
[03:13:18.000 --> 03:13:21.000]  transhumanism, the AI takeover.
[03:13:21.000 --> 03:13:25.000]  And the last time that we had Celeste Solem here on this broadcast with us,
[03:13:25.000 --> 03:13:31.000]  she talked to us about the hidden tech out there ready to manipulate human beings and hack the soul.
[03:13:31.000 --> 03:13:35.000]  She joins us today with more breaking news on the transhumanism front.
[03:13:35.000 --> 03:13:38.000]  Celeste Solem from CelestialReport.com.
[03:13:38.000 --> 03:13:39.000]  Welcome.
[03:13:39.000 --> 03:13:42.000]  It's great to be here, Maria.
[03:13:42.000 --> 03:13:44.000]  It's so good to see you again.
[03:13:44.000 --> 03:13:47.000]  Well, give us a brief outline of what you're going to be covering today.
[03:13:47.000 --> 03:13:51.000]  I know the news is hot, hot, hot off the press.
[03:13:51.000 --> 03:13:52.000]  It is, it is.
[03:13:52.000 --> 03:14:04.000]  So when I did the synthetic biology webinar, what I discovered was that there was a link between synthetic biology,
[03:14:04.000 --> 03:14:08.000]  Marxism, and the LGBT movement.
[03:14:08.000 --> 03:14:12.000]  And we think that it just kind of all sprang up at one time.
[03:14:12.000 --> 03:14:13.000]  It didn't.
[03:14:13.000 --> 03:14:18.000]  This has been very well planned out really since Darwin.
[03:14:19.000 --> 03:14:25.000]  But what we're going to talk about today, and I do have some notes to keep me on track because I do do deep dives,
[03:14:25.000 --> 03:14:27.000]  and we can't do that today.
[03:14:27.000 --> 03:14:36.000]  So I'm just going to be giving you all a brief overview of some of the things that I discovered as I was going down the rabbit hole.
[03:14:36.000 --> 03:14:40.000]  But we have to realize that this is just one component.
[03:14:40.000 --> 03:14:46.000]  Even though we're talking about synthetic biology, Marxism, and the LGBT community,
[03:14:46.000 --> 03:14:51.000]  it is only one component in an integrated weapons system.
[03:14:51.000 --> 03:14:55.000]  You need to realize that this is a weapons system.
[03:14:55.000 --> 03:14:58.000]  So that's what we're going to be talking about today.
[03:14:58.000 --> 03:15:02.000]  Well, I absolutely agree with you.
[03:15:02.000 --> 03:15:10.000]  And I've said on many broadcasts, especially of late Celeste, that the technology that these people have is so much further advanced.
[03:15:10.000 --> 03:15:16.000]  I just interviewed a researcher couple from Morocco, Hope and Tavon.
[03:15:16.000 --> 03:15:20.000]  They're scientists and researchers, former government employees as well.
[03:15:20.000 --> 03:15:27.000]  And they've been looking a lot into synthetic biology, the links between 5G, 6G, 7G,
[03:15:27.000 --> 03:15:32.000]  what the capabilities are of this technology in terms of controlling the human being,
[03:15:32.000 --> 03:15:38.000]  the technology that's in the injections, the technology that's in the upcoming injections.
[03:15:38.000 --> 03:15:43.000]  So the little needleless vaccine patches that we're creating here in Australia,
[03:15:43.000 --> 03:15:47.000]  400 million of them for a population of 25 million a year.
[03:15:47.000 --> 03:15:48.000]  Very, very interesting.
[03:15:48.000 --> 03:15:51.000]  So right after this short break, we're going to dive in with Celeste.
[03:15:51.000 --> 03:15:54.000]  Don't go anywhere. This is groundbreaking information.
[03:15:55.000 --> 03:16:02.000]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mugshot because they knew that that would help Trump.
[03:16:02.000 --> 03:16:04.000]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[03:16:04.000 --> 03:16:06.000]  We were waiting for the mugshot.
[03:16:06.000 --> 03:16:07.000]  We learned today they wouldn't have it.
[03:16:07.000 --> 03:16:09.000]  So we've made our own.
[03:16:09.000 --> 03:16:13.000]  And it says political prisoner with an image of President Trump.
[03:16:13.000 --> 03:16:16.000]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[03:16:16.000 --> 03:16:18.000]  It'll be shipping out to you in one week.
[03:16:19.000 --> 03:16:25.000]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front there in a mugshot jail background.
[03:16:25.000 --> 03:16:26.000]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[03:16:26.000 --> 03:16:30.000]  It says InfoWars.com on the back of the shirt.
[03:16:30.000 --> 03:16:32.000]  We also have Alex Jones for president.
[03:16:32.000 --> 03:16:33.000]  No, I'm not running for president.
[03:16:33.000 --> 03:16:36.000]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt, red, white and blue.
[03:16:36.000 --> 03:16:38.000]  Alex Jones for president 2024.
[03:16:38.000 --> 03:16:41.000]  It's a fun conversational piece and a limited edition shirt.
[03:16:41.000 --> 03:16:43.000]  Great way to fund the operation.
[03:16:43.000 --> 03:16:51.000]  So get your Alex Jones for president and Trump mugshot shirts at InfoWarsStore.com
[03:16:51.000 --> 03:16:55.000]  or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[03:16:56.000 --> 03:16:58.000]  The globalists are only humans.
[03:16:58.000 --> 03:17:00.000]  Yeah, they have control of the central banks.
[03:17:00.000 --> 03:17:02.000]  They have a lot of power, but they can be defeated.
[03:17:02.000 --> 03:17:05.000]  But some of their operations are going to take decades to stop.
[03:17:05.000 --> 03:17:10.000]  But one thing you can do right now is take control of your body and your family's body
[03:17:10.000 --> 03:17:14.000]  by purifying the water that you drink and that you cook with.
[03:17:14.000 --> 03:17:17.000]  And you do it with the highest quality gravity fed filter out there.
[03:17:17.000 --> 03:17:19.000]  This thing does 10,000 gallons.
[03:17:19.000 --> 03:17:22.000]  You can sit there and put hundreds of gallons through it a day.
[03:17:22.000 --> 03:17:27.000]  It purifies very quickly and it cuts out thousands of chemicals to non-detectable levels.
[03:17:27.000 --> 03:17:29.000]  This is what I use, which my family uses.
[03:17:29.000 --> 03:17:31.000]  It's the very best system out there for the lowest price.
[03:17:31.000 --> 03:17:34.000]  For a limited time, 10% off on top of that.
[03:17:34.000 --> 03:17:39.000]  Exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com on the Alexa Pure water filtration system.
[03:17:39.000 --> 03:17:43.000]  In stock and replacement filters for folks that need those in stock.
[03:17:43.000 --> 03:17:45.000]  Get it today and it funds the InfoWars.
[03:17:45.000 --> 03:17:46.000]  Don't procrastinate.
[03:17:46.000 --> 03:17:49.000]  This is one of the main areas we can take control of our lives
[03:17:49.000 --> 03:17:53.000]  and stop the globalists from hitting us with poison that they allow in the water supply.
[03:17:53.000 --> 03:17:56.000]  In some cases, they add the water supply like fluoride.
[03:17:56.000 --> 03:17:58.000]  Hey, everybody. Rodney out, Brian here.
[03:17:58.000 --> 03:18:03.000]  I want to thank Alex Jones and InfoWars for offering scholarships to River University.
[03:18:03.000 --> 03:18:06.000]  Maybe you're watching InfoWars today
[03:18:06.000 --> 03:18:11.000]  and you don't know what to do with the problems that we face in the world today.
[03:18:11.000 --> 03:18:15.000]  You've been through COVID-19, 2019, 2021, 2022, 2023.
[03:18:15.000 --> 03:18:20.000]  But here at River University, not only do we show you what the problem is,
[03:18:20.000 --> 03:18:22.000]  but we show you how to deal with it.
[03:18:22.000 --> 03:18:29.000]  Come, a full three-year bachelor degree will train you up in ministry, government, worship,
[03:18:29.000 --> 03:18:34.000]  that you can go out and actually bring about a transformation in the earth today.
[03:18:34.000 --> 03:18:38.000]  We have graduates going all over the world from the Arctic to the outback.
[03:18:38.000 --> 03:18:40.000]  And right here, this is what we do.
[03:18:40.000 --> 03:18:46.000]  We specialize in training people and equipping them for transformation.
[03:18:46.000 --> 03:18:47.000]  And that's what you'll do.
[03:18:47.000 --> 03:18:52.000]  So scan the QR code right now or go to riveruniversity.org
[03:18:52.000 --> 03:18:55.000]  and get the free scholarship offered to you by InfoWars.
[03:18:56.000 --> 03:18:58.000]  The globalists are only humans.
[03:18:58.000 --> 03:19:00.000]  Yeah, they have control of the central banks.
[03:19:00.000 --> 03:19:02.000]  They have a lot of power, but they can be defeated.
[03:19:02.000 --> 03:19:05.000]  But some of their operations are going to take decades to stop.
[03:19:05.000 --> 03:19:10.000]  But one thing you can do right now is take control of your body and your family's body
[03:19:10.000 --> 03:19:13.000]  by purifying the water that you drink and that you cook with.
[03:19:13.000 --> 03:19:17.000]  And you do it with the highest quality gravity-fed filter out there.
[03:19:17.000 --> 03:19:19.000]  This thing does 10,000 gallons.
[03:19:19.000 --> 03:19:22.000]  You can sit there and put hundreds of gallons through it a day.
[03:19:22.000 --> 03:19:27.000]  It purifies very quickly, and it cuts out thousands of chemicals to non-detectable levels.
[03:19:27.000 --> 03:19:29.000]  This is what I use, which my family uses.
[03:19:29.000 --> 03:19:32.000]  It's the very best system out there for the lowest price for a limited time,
[03:19:32.000 --> 03:19:36.000]  10% off on top of that exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com

[03:19:45.000 --> 03:19:46.000]  Don't procrastinate.
[03:19:46.000 --> 03:19:49.000]  This is one of the main areas we can take control of our lives
[03:19:49.000 --> 03:19:53.000]  and stop the globalists from hitting us with poison that they allow in the water supply.
[03:19:53.000 --> 03:19:56.000]  In some cases, they add the water supply like fluoride.
[03:19:57.000 --> 03:20:02.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[03:20:02.000 --> 03:20:04.000]  it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:05.600 --> 03:20:14.760]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:14.760 --> 03:20:18.720]  Right before the break, I mentioned a recent interview I did with Hope and Tevon, a couple
[03:20:18.720 --> 03:20:20.200]  out of Morocco.
[03:20:20.200 --> 03:20:23.680]  That's actually up on the Z Media tab on band.video right now.
[03:20:23.680 --> 03:20:26.560]  It's also the featured video on zmedia.com.
[03:20:26.560 --> 03:20:28.360]  I really do encourage everyone to watch that.
[03:20:28.360 --> 03:20:32.000]  In that video, there's a lot of discussion around this technology, how it integrates
[03:20:32.000 --> 03:20:34.720]  with 5G, 6G, the satellites, all of that.
[03:20:34.880 --> 03:20:41.360]  They mention a particular man named Achildes, who's working on a lot of this tech.
[03:20:41.360 --> 03:20:45.840]  He actually slips up in one of his presentations, and we've got evidence of it.
[03:20:45.840 --> 03:20:50.560]  This is on YouTube, where he talks about the COVID shots being essentially programmable
[03:20:50.560 --> 03:20:52.560]  technology.
[03:20:52.560 --> 03:20:58.720]  I think that what we said before, and what Celeste said before, a lot of this tech supersedes
[03:20:58.720 --> 03:21:03.120]  many people's understanding, but Celeste is going to give us some more insight, so please,
[03:21:03.120 --> 03:21:05.120]  you've got the floor, Celeste.
[03:21:05.120 --> 03:21:10.560]  Okay, so this is basically, we've entered a time of the real-life Hunger Games.
[03:21:10.560 --> 03:21:17.200]  They've arranged that it's a gladiatorial competition between the kinds, which is like
[03:21:17.200 --> 03:21:23.600]  humans and animals and plants that have always been known and existed on our planet, versus
[03:21:23.600 --> 03:21:25.600]  the clades.
[03:21:25.600 --> 03:21:31.680]  Clades are the new synthetic biology that is replacing us, and they are digitized, so it
[03:21:31.680 --> 03:21:33.680]  is programmable.
[03:21:33.680 --> 03:21:37.600]  It also includes things like the selfish gene, and you guys, I know you've all heard about
[03:21:37.600 --> 03:21:39.600]  the selfish gene.
[03:21:39.600 --> 03:21:46.560]  There was Bill Gates, I think, talking about it a while ago, now, so we're going to go into
[03:21:46.560 --> 03:21:48.560]  the weeds just a little bit.
[03:21:48.560 --> 03:21:57.120]  There's weaponization of identity, so basically, the power elite have decided that you do not
[03:21:57.120 --> 03:22:03.120]  have ownership of your identity, so this is going to play a factor.
[03:22:03.120 --> 03:22:05.680]  We're going to go through this pretty quickly.
[03:22:05.680 --> 03:22:15.360]  That is why they said you will have nothing and be happy, that that is your, partly includes
[03:22:15.360 --> 03:22:24.080]  your identity, and another thing that many of us have not dove into, I did a year ago,
[03:22:24.080 --> 03:22:29.280]  is that you will not persist in space and time.
[03:22:29.280 --> 03:22:37.280]  They want to rob you of eternal life or having a good life here on this planet, but then
[03:22:37.280 --> 03:22:44.720]  they also want to rob you of this eternal life that we are going to have, so basically,
[03:22:44.720 --> 03:22:47.280]  they want to eradicate you for all time.
[03:22:48.080 --> 03:22:53.520]  Then, basically, oops, just a sec, I just got this.
[03:22:53.520 --> 03:22:56.240]  While you look, that statement is absolutely true.
[03:22:56.240 --> 03:23:01.760]  We're dealing with satanists here who don't want you to go into the eternal life that
[03:23:01.760 --> 03:23:02.960]  you're destined for.
[03:23:02.960 --> 03:23:04.800]  They want you to be damned with them.
[03:23:06.240 --> 03:23:13.680]  Absolutely, and the bottom line, so they want you erased for all time, which is what I discovered
[03:23:13.680 --> 03:23:19.920]  through synthetic biology and the Soul Catcher series, but they, in this process, there are
[03:23:19.920 --> 03:23:21.200]  weapon systems.
[03:23:21.200 --> 03:23:25.440]  There's layer upon layer, and I hope we get a chance to talk about it sometime, and what
[03:23:25.440 --> 03:23:29.520]  they do is confuse individuals, and what have we been noticing?
[03:23:29.520 --> 03:23:38.080]  A lot of people since 2020 have gotten confused, and they say, notice that they say individuals.
[03:23:38.080 --> 03:23:42.560]  You know the semantic shell game that you see, I see?
[03:23:42.560 --> 03:23:50.560]  They say individuals, so they are not even acknowledging us as humans or mankind, so
[03:23:50.560 --> 03:23:52.720]  they're confusing all of the things.
[03:23:52.720 --> 03:23:57.280]  Even the synthetic biology is confusion, chaos.
[03:23:57.280 --> 03:24:04.960]  It destroys mankind's perception of themselves, so basically, your identity is who you are,
[03:24:04.960 --> 03:24:06.480]  who you think you are.
[03:24:06.480 --> 03:24:12.240]  They are in the process of doing this through their weapon systems and using synthetic biology.
[03:24:13.520 --> 03:24:21.600]  One of the big things that I found in synthetic biology is that they are removing the internal
[03:24:21.600 --> 03:24:27.680]  boundaries that we have, and they're doing that at all the levels, like they're taking
[03:24:27.680 --> 03:24:38.080]  matter, a table, a piece of fruit, breaking it down to the molecular level, atomic molecules,
[03:24:38.080 --> 03:24:44.400]  and then re-engineering it, so these boundaries, then we're crossing things like the spiritual
[03:24:44.400 --> 03:24:50.880]  line, just the physicality.
[03:24:50.880 --> 03:24:55.280]  All the things that we knew and took for granted, they're erasing.
[03:24:55.280 --> 03:24:59.840]  Let me make sure that I'm understanding you right here, Celeste.
[03:24:59.840 --> 03:25:06.800]  When we're saying the whole concept of synthetic biology is they're recreating our biology the
[03:25:06.800 --> 03:25:11.440]  way that they want it to work or be programmed, and so when you're saying they're breaking
[03:25:11.440 --> 03:25:17.520]  down even things like fruits and vegetables to that molecular level and re-engineering
[03:25:17.520 --> 03:25:23.760]  them, that also would react with the human biology when consuming that, and so all of
[03:25:23.760 --> 03:25:27.520]  these things are integrated, and the weapon systems that you're talking about I'm presuming
[03:25:27.520 --> 03:25:32.480]  have to do with the frequencies in 5G and other EMF, am I right?
[03:25:33.920 --> 03:25:39.760]  Absolutely, absolutely, because where does synthetic biology get its orders from?
[03:25:39.760 --> 03:25:42.560]  It's from the 5G, 6G, 7G.
[03:25:44.640 --> 03:25:47.040]  That's what's driving it, kind of.
[03:25:47.040 --> 03:25:48.320]  It's the driver of the car.
[03:25:49.280 --> 03:25:55.040]  You can think of synthetic biology as kind of a vehicle, a transport vehicle, and it
[03:25:55.040 --> 03:25:57.120]  will transport many things, and it will do.
[03:25:57.680 --> 03:26:02.960]  Synthetic biology at its core changes your function and my function.
[03:26:02.960 --> 03:26:11.120]  We had a function when we were born and a calling, and it changes our function down
[03:26:11.120 --> 03:26:18.960]  at the molecular level to do something else, to serve the agenda that we don't consciously,
[03:26:18.960 --> 03:26:24.560]  at this point, I don't agree with, and so basically they're turning things like our
[03:26:24.560 --> 03:26:29.120]  hair into hair bots that will suck out the UN pollution.
[03:26:30.160 --> 03:26:32.720]  We're just getting a few noises on your answer list.
[03:26:32.720 --> 03:26:34.800]  I don't know if you're getting notifications.
[03:26:34.800 --> 03:26:36.400]  I just want to make you aware of that.
[03:26:36.640 --> 03:26:47.040]  Are you saying that based on this, they're already deploying the weapons system through
[03:26:47.040 --> 03:26:53.440]  the frequencies with the fact that the tech that's kind of already inside human beings,
[03:26:53.440 --> 03:26:58.240]  and this is being found by so many people around the world, Dr Anna Mihaiča, along
[03:26:58.240 --> 03:27:02.480]  with Clifford Carnicom, Karen Kingston's spoken about this before, former Pfizer employee
[03:27:02.480 --> 03:27:03.440]  and biotech analyst.
[03:27:04.000 --> 03:27:07.120]  So there are so many people around the world that are finding this tech.
[03:27:07.120 --> 03:27:10.960]  I've exposed it and brought it up on this broadcast many times.
[03:27:10.960 --> 03:27:16.160]  That's already integrating, and this is why we're seeing the explosion of all of this
[03:27:16.160 --> 03:27:16.800]  debauchery.
[03:27:17.360 --> 03:27:20.640]  We're seeing this explosion of kids confused about their gender.
[03:27:20.640 --> 03:27:23.280]  Is this the reason it's already being deployed?
[03:27:24.640 --> 03:27:30.320]  Yes, actually, there were a number of us that were electronically identified in the 50s
[03:27:30.320 --> 03:27:32.240]  and 60s through vaccination.
[03:27:32.320 --> 03:27:37.680]  Remember, those were the years that there was a huge push for vaccination, and so it
[03:27:37.680 --> 03:27:39.680]  has been only increasing.
[03:27:39.680 --> 03:27:44.160]  2005 was a pivotal year where it really went operational.
[03:27:46.320 --> 03:27:52.720]  There was a UN mandate for something called the National Animal Identification System,
[03:27:52.720 --> 03:27:56.160]  and they consider us animals, and it had three pillars.
[03:27:58.160 --> 03:28:01.040]  Everything belongs to the government is pillar one.
[03:28:02.240 --> 03:28:08.160]  Pillar two is all biological life must be electronically identified, and the third was
[03:28:08.160 --> 03:28:11.760]  24-7 surveillance, and this is what we're seeing now.
[03:28:11.760 --> 03:28:17.760]  They believe that they own all of us and every cell in us, and so that they have the right
[03:28:17.760 --> 03:28:20.800]  to do an incursion into our body and change us.
[03:28:22.480 --> 03:28:25.280]  I have some interesting facts to add to that.
[03:28:25.280 --> 03:28:29.440]  I just did a three-part series on biodigital convergence.
[03:28:29.440 --> 03:28:31.760]  For anyone who hasn't seen it, it's up on Zaymedia.com.
[03:28:31.760 --> 03:28:37.680]  I really encourage people to watch it, and I include a paper written by legal experts
[03:28:37.680 --> 03:28:40.560]  on this difference between an owned human and a pwned human.
[03:28:41.760 --> 03:28:46.640]  Who owns the human now that this technology is inside of them when we consider the internet
[03:28:46.640 --> 03:28:47.920]  of bodies, internet of things?
[03:28:47.920 --> 03:28:50.160]  These people actually think they own you.
[03:28:50.160 --> 03:28:52.640]  We'll get into that a little bit more on the other side of this break.
[03:28:52.640 --> 03:28:53.280]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:28:53.280 --> 03:28:54.720]  This is mind-blowing stuff.
[03:28:55.600 --> 03:29:00.160]  Infowarsstore.com is like a grocery store or like a vitamin shop.
[03:29:00.160 --> 03:29:02.320]  We want to have all the best brands for you.
[03:29:02.320 --> 03:29:06.000]  We want to have a bunch of different choices for you, so I get constant questions online
[03:29:06.000 --> 03:29:06.720]  and in person.
[03:29:06.720 --> 03:29:08.320]  Hey, what's better, knockout?
[03:29:08.320 --> 03:29:10.400]  What's better, down-and-out?
[03:29:10.400 --> 03:29:10.960]  What's better?
[03:29:10.960 --> 03:29:13.040]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[03:29:13.040 --> 03:29:17.840]  And the answer is different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different
[03:29:17.840 --> 03:29:21.200]  people, so one person might like this coffee.
[03:29:21.200 --> 03:29:22.720]  Another person likes that coffee.
[03:29:23.680 --> 03:29:25.040]  That's how our bodies work.
[03:29:25.040 --> 03:29:29.680]  They're all very diverse, but we've been able to private label a national bestseller that's
[03:29:29.680 --> 03:29:34.080]  been sold for many years that people love and sold for a lower price under the name
[03:29:34.080 --> 03:29:36.640]  Infowars MD Good Night Sleep.
[03:29:37.280 --> 03:29:42.400]  This is a great formula full of amazing safe compounds, give you deeper, cleaner, restful
[03:29:42.400 --> 03:29:47.440]  sleep, and it's in stock available right now of 25% off out of the gates.

[03:29:53.680 --> 03:30:00.880]  The globalists aren't just targeting us through the poison shots or the electromagnetic
[03:30:00.880 --> 03:30:02.960]  5G or the GMO crops.
[03:30:02.960 --> 03:30:08.000]  They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals that the EPA has authorized companies and
[03:30:08.000 --> 03:30:08.720]  industry to use.
[03:30:09.360 --> 03:30:14.960]  One of the top pesticides used is atrazine, the allowable level the government admits
[03:30:14.960 --> 03:30:19.120]  that they allow to be in your water supply is enough to sterilize you and basically turn
[03:30:19.120 --> 03:30:21.920]  your son into a feminized mutant.
[03:30:22.000 --> 03:30:22.480]  Look it up.
[03:30:23.040 --> 03:30:24.400]  Don't let them do this to your family.
[03:30:24.400 --> 03:30:29.680]  We have the very best gravity-fed filter system out there, highest rated at half the price
[03:30:29.680 --> 03:30:30.720]  of leading competitors.

[03:31:56.160 --> 03:32:00.560]  With all the craziness in the world, the collapsing borders, the war with Russia,
[03:32:01.200 --> 03:32:05.120]  the insanity, the currency devaluations, the economy going crazy,
[03:32:05.760 --> 03:32:08.320]  you are crazy, in my view, if you don't get high-quality,
[03:32:08.320 --> 03:32:11.520]  storable food and water filtration and self-defense.
[03:32:11.520 --> 03:32:13.200]  Now, we're not selling guns and ammo.
[03:32:13.200 --> 03:32:16.080]  That's for you to go out and get for yourself and learn how to use if you haven't.
[03:32:16.080 --> 03:32:17.840]  And I preach to the choir on that.
[03:32:17.840 --> 03:32:19.760]  But a lot of people got plenty of guns,
[03:32:19.760 --> 03:32:22.800]  but they don't have enough storable food or water filtration.
[03:32:22.800 --> 03:32:24.480]  This is something you need now.
[03:32:24.480 --> 03:32:26.640]  And we've got it in the food department
[03:32:26.640 --> 03:32:29.040]  and in the high-quality water filtration department.

[03:32:55.300 --> 03:33:05.300]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:06.500 --> 03:33:17.340]  And we are back with my special guest Celeste Solemn.
[03:33:17.340 --> 03:33:22.900]  You know, while humanity is fighting against the New World Order, one of the biggest components
[03:33:22.900 --> 03:33:25.700]  of that fight is the fight against transhumanism.
[03:33:25.700 --> 03:33:32.180]  And so many people may not be aware that this is something that's already a very real threat.
[03:33:32.180 --> 03:33:38.420]  I just read an article this morning, Celeste, about someone creating a rival to chat GPT.
[03:33:38.420 --> 03:33:44.140]  This thing is already being weaponised to hack people and, you know, one of the last
[03:33:44.140 --> 03:33:46.900]  callers was talking about deep fakes and things of this nature.
[03:33:46.900 --> 03:33:49.980]  But we're talking about something even beyond that.
[03:33:49.980 --> 03:33:54.260]  So what links do we think there are, Celeste?
[03:33:54.260 --> 03:34:00.300]  Because you're right, there's been this explosion in kids just having, you know, being confused
[03:34:00.300 --> 03:34:01.300]  about their identity.
[03:34:01.300 --> 03:34:07.140]  Of course, that's partly due to the education indoctrination centres that they call schools.
[03:34:07.140 --> 03:34:12.540]  And it's also because of the culture and social media and all of this.
[03:34:12.540 --> 03:34:15.460]  But are we saying that there's more to it?
[03:34:15.460 --> 03:34:16.460]  There is more to it.
[03:34:16.460 --> 03:34:19.580]  So let's look briefly at a person.
[03:34:19.580 --> 03:34:33.460]  So only a legal person has rights and a person can be like the government or whatever.
[03:34:33.460 --> 03:34:37.180]  It doesn't necessarily have to be a human.
[03:34:37.180 --> 03:34:41.740]  Think about the ramifications when we talk about synthetic biology, which in synthetic
[03:34:41.740 --> 03:34:50.740]  biology they mix all these different creatures, nanobots, plants, insects into your DNA.
[03:34:50.740 --> 03:34:55.180]  So you're like just this mixed soup, so to speak.
[03:34:55.180 --> 03:35:03.740]  And then but only a legal person and they're not saying a legal man or woman.
[03:35:03.740 --> 03:35:09.700]  So you are looking at a time when we have no rights as a man or a woman.
[03:35:09.700 --> 03:35:14.900]  As a matter of fact, in, you know, hopefully in the next segment, we'll just deep dive
[03:35:14.900 --> 03:35:19.500]  really quick and go through what they are doing to sexuality.
[03:35:19.500 --> 03:35:26.220]  Because basically they say, the powers that be, say you don't have a right to your own
[03:35:26.220 --> 03:35:27.220]  sexuality.
[03:35:27.220 --> 03:35:35.860]  Your sexuality is determined by hormones, environment, and anything that we give you,
[03:35:35.860 --> 03:35:38.900]  but you don't own your sexuality.
[03:35:38.900 --> 03:35:39.900]  And so this is...
[03:35:39.900 --> 03:35:44.220]  You all know what Harari has said that AI is going to tell you if you're gay.
[03:35:44.220 --> 03:35:47.260]  You don't know if you're gay, AI is going to tell you if you are.
[03:35:47.260 --> 03:35:48.820]  So these are statements that have been made.
[03:35:48.820 --> 03:35:49.820]  You're not wrong.
[03:35:49.820 --> 03:35:50.820]  Keep going.
[03:35:50.820 --> 03:35:51.820]  We have time.
[03:35:51.820 --> 03:35:52.820]  Yeah.
[03:35:52.820 --> 03:35:59.580]  So let's just dive into the, well, I want to talk about something that I discovered.
[03:35:59.580 --> 03:36:05.980]  I was on a legal forum in the 1990s and it was between academia and the lawyers.
[03:36:05.980 --> 03:36:13.580]  And they were discussing who has got supremacy on the earth, whether it's human or whether
[03:36:13.580 --> 03:36:14.860]  it's animal.
[03:36:14.860 --> 03:36:22.620]  And it was decided already in the 1990s that humans have primacy in the law over humans.
[03:36:22.620 --> 03:36:26.780]  And then I watched that happen at work.
[03:36:26.780 --> 03:36:33.220]  You know, the day came, there was a disaster and this guy calls up and he says, can I save
[03:36:33.220 --> 03:36:34.220]  my property?
[03:36:34.220 --> 03:36:37.260]  Can I do whatever I need to do to save my property?
[03:36:37.260 --> 03:36:42.980]  And we had to say, because the Corps of Engineers said no, that was the first time we had to
[03:36:42.980 --> 03:36:45.820]  say no because of the fish.
[03:36:45.820 --> 03:36:50.620]  But so the guy hung up, it was before caller ID, I thought he was safe.
[03:36:50.620 --> 03:36:59.380]  But when I was back at FEMA, they had installed some satellites and they actually took pictures.
[03:36:59.380 --> 03:37:07.260]  And this guy comes out from the bottom of where I worked with like pictures of every
[03:37:07.260 --> 03:37:10.480]  little rock like this big.
[03:37:10.480 --> 03:37:12.180]  So they were monitoring.
[03:37:12.180 --> 03:37:16.540]  So basically, humans no longer have rights.
[03:37:16.540 --> 03:37:20.940]  We have to abdicate to animals.
[03:37:20.940 --> 03:37:24.780]  That set the stage for what they're doing now with this transhumanism.
[03:37:24.780 --> 03:37:35.100]  So now anything has a right over human, including artificial and synthetic, a synth, something
[03:37:35.100 --> 03:37:41.700]  that is a synthetic humanoid that is not even a human at all, has nothing human.
[03:37:41.700 --> 03:37:47.820]  It looks human, but it has artificial blood, artificial organs, artificial brain.
[03:37:47.820 --> 03:37:51.660]  It can be inhabited by demonic entities.
[03:37:51.660 --> 03:38:02.820]  So it set the stage and a precedent so that that is considered a legal individual, not
[03:38:02.820 --> 03:38:07.180]  a human or not a person, a man or a woman.
[03:38:07.180 --> 03:38:12.300]  Well, what you're talking about is incredibly complicated, but I'm going to do my best to
[03:38:12.300 --> 03:38:15.540]  sort of break this down and explain how it's the case.
[03:38:15.540 --> 03:38:19.700]  So that's not what we believe and that's not what God says, but that's what the globalist
[03:38:19.740 --> 03:38:20.740]  mentality is.
[03:38:20.740 --> 03:38:27.100]  And I referenced these legal papers that I was reading as part of the Biodigital Convergence
[03:38:27.100 --> 03:38:32.020]  series, and there was a discussion about whether a human being was owned or pwned.
[03:38:32.020 --> 03:38:34.780]  And they gave the example of a pacemaker.
[03:38:34.780 --> 03:38:40.180]  When someone has a pacemaker installed in them, the people that have created that pacemaker
[03:38:40.180 --> 03:38:42.220]  own that pacemaker.
[03:38:42.220 --> 03:38:47.300]  So they were talking about, OK, well, when we're looking at synthetic biology and all
[03:38:47.300 --> 03:38:52.260]  of this tech being inside the human, weaved inside them and linking them to the Internet
[03:38:52.260 --> 03:38:55.820]  of Bodies, is that human being now owned?
[03:38:55.820 --> 03:39:00.020]  Because they're essentially integrated with the technology of the creators.
[03:39:00.020 --> 03:39:05.540]  And so it really was not able, the paper was not able to answer the question.
[03:39:05.540 --> 03:39:13.180]  Because again, if the pacemaker is owned by the maker and they're changing the human being
[03:39:13.420 --> 03:39:19.100]  with their tech, and we're talking about a technology that goes in and essentially hacks
[03:39:19.100 --> 03:39:20.100]  your brain neurons.
[03:39:20.100 --> 03:39:23.940]  It creates new neurons and overcomes your existing brain neurons.
[03:39:23.940 --> 03:39:29.380]  I know it sounds wacky, but this is absolutely evidenced in their peer-reviewed papers in
[03:39:29.380 --> 03:39:31.660]  so many publications on nanotech.
[03:39:31.660 --> 03:39:39.180]  So am I correct then in my explanation, Celeste, of how this actually becomes a reality for
[03:39:39.180 --> 03:39:42.140]  those creating this technology?
[03:39:42.140 --> 03:39:49.580]  Back in 2005, we found out with this National Animal Identification System that the government
[03:39:49.580 --> 03:39:54.740]  was all the different, you were issued when you were electronically identified an alphanumeric
[03:39:54.740 --> 03:39:57.500]  number with the country code in front.
[03:39:57.500 --> 03:40:01.460]  That put the government in first position of owning.
[03:40:01.460 --> 03:40:08.100]  Then in the 1990s, we also saw, remember that genetically modified farm that was right next
[03:40:08.100 --> 03:40:16.500]  to an organic farm and the wind blew and it blew the genetic, the Monsanto pollen over
[03:40:16.500 --> 03:40:17.860]  to the organic farm.
[03:40:17.860 --> 03:40:24.380]  It went to court and it set the precedent because they were found that the organic farm
[03:40:24.380 --> 03:40:27.820]  stole the property of Monsanto.
[03:40:27.820 --> 03:40:32.620]  So what you're talking about, now we have synthetic biology.
[03:40:32.620 --> 03:40:33.620]  Let me explain.
[03:40:33.620 --> 03:40:38.500]  In one of the, it can be in a therapeutic, it can be in a vaccine.
[03:40:38.500 --> 03:40:42.020]  It has a substrate, which is a foundation.
[03:40:42.020 --> 03:40:43.300]  This is nano-sized.
[03:40:43.300 --> 03:40:46.260]  This is at the molecular level or atomic level.
[03:40:46.260 --> 03:40:48.580]  Then there's writing in there.
[03:40:48.580 --> 03:40:52.740]  It's a nano-lithography and then they encrypt it.
[03:40:52.740 --> 03:40:59.820]  Now anything can be in there, I believe, and I saw evidence in 2005 along with some other
[03:40:59.820 --> 03:41:04.060]  lawyers that they were changing ownership.
[03:41:04.060 --> 03:41:14.460]  That there is a change of ownership or a shift from you as being this person into being owned.
[03:41:14.460 --> 03:41:16.020]  And then it's encrypted.
[03:41:16.020 --> 03:41:21.260]  It goes into a therapeutic, it goes into a vaccine, it goes into your body.
[03:41:21.260 --> 03:41:25.780]  And there is this contract in the blockchain.
[03:41:25.820 --> 03:41:33.020]  And yes, given the precedent back in 1990, you are in fact owned.
[03:41:33.020 --> 03:41:35.180]  This is intellectual property.
[03:41:35.180 --> 03:41:41.580]  That's what Monsanto claimed is that this organic farm stole their intellectual property.
[03:41:41.580 --> 03:41:50.100]  And actually when we take something in then, this has even deeper depths to it.
[03:41:50.100 --> 03:41:54.620]  Yes, then we're owned, but we can transmit this.
[03:41:54.860 --> 03:42:03.780]  If I go to shake your hand and I have spike protein or any of these sapphire nanocubes
[03:42:03.780 --> 03:42:06.860]  in me, I can actually transmit it.
[03:42:06.860 --> 03:42:11.260]  These are called memetic mind virus.
[03:42:11.260 --> 03:42:12.660]  It can go out.
[03:42:12.660 --> 03:42:13.660]  It's self-spreading.
[03:42:13.660 --> 03:42:15.340]  It's transmissible.
[03:42:15.340 --> 03:42:17.220]  It's been known for a long time.
[03:42:17.220 --> 03:42:20.220]  This is another one of their weapon systems.
[03:42:20.220 --> 03:42:28.420]  So then if I shake your hand, Ria, and you get it, then you also are owned just by the
[03:42:28.420 --> 03:42:33.780]  mere fact that I shook your hand and it was transmitted to you because you're holding
[03:42:33.780 --> 03:42:35.740]  that intellectual property.
[03:42:35.740 --> 03:42:38.860]  Very, very interesting.
[03:42:38.860 --> 03:42:43.980]  And I have something to add to that from an attorney and an admission in courts, as well
[03:42:43.980 --> 03:42:48.660]  as what an Australian court recently said to someone that we interviewed.
[03:42:48.660 --> 03:42:50.460]  These people really think like this.
[03:42:50.460 --> 03:42:53.620]  So let's expand on that right after this short break.
[03:42:53.620 --> 03:42:54.620]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:42:54.620 --> 03:42:56.660]  We'll be right back.
[03:42:56.660 --> 03:42:58.460]  The globalists are only humans.
[03:42:58.460 --> 03:43:00.460]  Yeah, they have control of the central banks.
[03:43:00.460 --> 03:43:02.900]  They have a lot of power, but they can be defeated.
[03:43:02.900 --> 03:43:06.100]  But some of their operations are going to take decades to stop.
[03:43:06.100 --> 03:43:10.220]  But one thing you can do right now is take control of your body and your family's body
[03:43:10.220 --> 03:43:14.300]  by purifying the water that you drink and that you cook with.
[03:43:14.300 --> 03:43:17.900]  And you do it with the highest quality gravity fed filter out there.
[03:43:17.900 --> 03:43:20.100]  This thing does 10,000 gallons.
[03:43:20.100 --> 03:43:22.780]  You can sit there and put hundreds of gallons through it a day.
[03:43:22.780 --> 03:43:27.060]  It purifies very quickly and it cuts out thousands of chemicals to non-detectable levels.
[03:43:27.060 --> 03:43:29.380]  This is what I use, which my family uses.
[03:43:29.380 --> 03:43:33.340]  It's the very best system out there for the lowest price for a limited time, 10% off on
[03:43:33.340 --> 03:43:39.260]  top of that exclusively at InfowarsStore.com on the Alexa Pure water filtration system
[03:43:39.260 --> 03:43:43.060]  in stock and replacement filters for folks that need those in stock.

[03:43:46.260 --> 03:43:50.060]  It's one of the main areas we can take control of our lives and stop the globalists from
[03:43:50.060 --> 03:43:52.660]  hitting us with poison that they allow in the water supply.
[03:43:52.660 --> 03:43:56.460]  In some cases, they add the water supply like fluoride.
[03:43:56.460 --> 03:44:00.300]  This is Adam King, host of The Adam King Show, joined by the one and only Greg Reiss of The
[03:44:00.300 --> 03:44:01.300]  Reiss Report.
[03:44:01.300 --> 03:44:04.980]  We wanted to hop on and send everybody to InfowarStore.com.

[03:44:13.420 --> 03:44:14.780]  Greg, what do you got there?
[03:44:14.780 --> 03:44:18.940]  If you really want to treat yourself to something nice, get yourself an Alexa Pure water filter
[03:44:18.940 --> 03:44:23.820]  and get clean, healthy water whenever you want it, wherever you want it.
[03:44:23.820 --> 03:44:29.020]  Even if the water pressure goes out, the gravity-fed water filter has got you covered.
[03:44:29.020 --> 03:44:30.860]  Absolutely.
[03:44:30.860 --> 03:44:35.900]  And we couldn't do any of this without listener support.
[03:44:35.900 --> 03:44:40.580]  I was telling Greg earlier, we're like the real NPR, the real NPR of The Based Right.
[03:44:40.580 --> 03:44:43.660]  So click that QR code right there on your screen right now.
[03:44:43.660 --> 03:44:44.660]  Take out your phone.
[03:44:44.660 --> 03:44:45.660]  Click that QR code.
[03:44:45.660 --> 03:44:47.820]  It'll take you directly to InfowarStore.com.

[03:44:48.940 --> 03:44:49.940]  Support The Infowar.
[03:44:49.940 --> 03:44:53.260]  Keep Alex Jones, Orrin Schroer, Harrison Smith, Greg Reiss, Adam King, and the rest of us
[03:44:53.260 --> 03:44:54.260]  on air.
[03:44:54.260 --> 03:44:55.260]  Do it today.
[03:44:55.260 --> 03:44:56.260]  Do it now.
[03:44:56.260 --> 03:44:57.620]  Support The Infowar.
[03:44:57.620 --> 03:45:02.220]  The globalists aren't just targeting us through the poison shots or the electromagnetic 5G
[03:45:02.220 --> 03:45:04.060]  or the GMO crops.
[03:45:04.060 --> 03:45:09.540]  They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals that the EPA has authorized companies and industry
[03:45:09.540 --> 03:45:10.540]  to use.
[03:45:10.540 --> 03:45:13.780]  One of the top pesticides used is atrazine.
[03:45:13.780 --> 03:45:17.420]  The allowable level the government admits that they allow to be in your water supply
[03:45:17.420 --> 03:45:23.020]  is enough to sterilize you and basically turn your son into a feminized mutant.
[03:45:23.020 --> 03:45:24.020]  Look it up.
[03:45:24.020 --> 03:45:25.380]  Don't let them do this to your family.
[03:45:25.380 --> 03:45:28.620]  We have the very best gravity-fed filter system out there.
[03:45:28.620 --> 03:45:33.180]  Highest rated at half the price of leading competitors, the Alexa Pure, ready to ship
[03:45:33.180 --> 03:45:34.180]  to you right now.
[03:45:34.180 --> 03:45:36.340]  We have replacement filters for folks who have already gotten it.
[03:45:36.340 --> 03:45:38.260]  It does 10,000 gallons before you replace them.
[03:45:38.260 --> 03:45:39.300]  It is amazing.
[03:45:39.300 --> 03:45:40.740]  It's great for your home, your business.
[03:45:40.740 --> 03:45:44.340]  You can put swamp water in it, tap water, well water.
[03:45:44.340 --> 03:45:45.620]  Almost everything's contaminated.
[03:45:45.620 --> 03:45:49.660]  This is how you take control of the fluids in your body and counter the globalist onslaught.
[03:45:49.660 --> 03:45:51.380]  Get yours today at InfowarStore.com.
[03:45:51.380 --> 03:45:53.660]  For a limited time, we're running a 10% discount.
[03:45:53.660 --> 03:45:54.660]  That is a huge discount.
[03:45:54.660 --> 03:45:56.020]  It's probably the lowest price out there.
[03:45:56.020 --> 03:45:57.020]  You need this filter.
[03:45:57.020 --> 03:46:01.620]  I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had.
[03:46:01.620 --> 03:46:06.780]  I don't think anybody can deny it, and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting
[03:46:06.780 --> 03:46:07.780]  us.
[03:46:07.820 --> 03:46:13.220]  When we talk about the crew at Infowars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[03:46:13.220 --> 03:46:16.140]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[03:46:16.140 --> 03:46:21.100]  When we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day,
[03:46:21.100 --> 03:46:25.740]  five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[03:46:25.740 --> 03:46:28.580]  For myself and the whole Infowars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[03:46:28.580 --> 03:46:34.020]  I want to encourage you now to realize that Infowars cannot stay on air if you do not support
[03:46:34.020 --> 03:46:35.020]  us.
[03:46:35.020 --> 03:46:36.020]  I know you spread the word.
[03:46:36.020 --> 03:46:37.020]  I know you pray for us.
[03:46:37.020 --> 03:46:38.020]  It's wonderful.
[03:46:38.020 --> 03:46:39.020]  Keep doing it.
[03:46:39.020 --> 03:46:43.020]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfowarsStore.com, and you never buy great
[03:46:43.020 --> 03:46:46.900]  products that enrich and empower your life all at the same time keeping us on air.
[03:46:46.900 --> 03:46:51.300]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:46:51.300 --> 03:46:55.420]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfowarsStore.com, our funding problems
[03:46:55.420 --> 03:46:56.420]  will be over.
[03:46:56.420 --> 03:46:58.980]  Please take action now.
[03:46:58.980 --> 03:47:04.980]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:06.500 --> 03:47:17.180]  Last year, I did an interview with attorney Todd Callender, who's been on this broadcast
[03:47:17.180 --> 03:47:21.940]  with me before, and Forbes and USA Today wrote an article about it.
[03:47:21.940 --> 03:47:22.940]  The team have got it.
[03:47:22.940 --> 03:47:25.260]  They'll bring it up on the screen right now.
[03:47:25.260 --> 03:47:31.700]  Todd spoke about the term homoborgenesis and said, here are unfounded claims that COVID-19
[03:47:31.700 --> 03:47:33.740]  vaccinated are no longer human.
[03:47:33.740 --> 03:47:36.540]  That's what Forbes said in response to our interview.
[03:47:36.540 --> 03:47:40.580]  USA Today also wrote about it and claimed that they contacted me for comment, but I
[03:47:40.580 --> 03:47:43.540]  will publicly say that never happened.
[03:47:43.540 --> 03:47:48.100]  But the reason that Todd was talking about this term was because he was actually in court
[03:47:48.100 --> 03:47:53.880]  asking in one of his cases that he was dealing with, whether the court considered human beings
[03:47:53.880 --> 03:47:59.220]  their property, because they were now patented based on a US Supreme Court decision many
[03:47:59.220 --> 03:48:03.000]  years ago, and they could not answer his question.
[03:48:03.000 --> 03:48:08.340]  Then in Australia, in recent times, we had an instance of a gentleman who went into
[03:48:08.340 --> 03:48:15.480]  court over a nonsense accusation that he was breaching COVID rules.
[03:48:15.480 --> 03:48:21.640]  I won't get into the details, but he actually said to the judge, Your Honor, am I your property?
[03:48:21.640 --> 03:48:24.600]  She said, yes, you are, actually.
[03:48:24.600 --> 03:48:29.040]  At the time, I asked the question, how widespread is this thinking?
[03:48:29.040 --> 03:48:32.280]  How widespread is the thinking that human beings are now owned?
[03:48:32.600 --> 03:48:39.120]  Again, we don't believe that, and I'm absolutely no one's property but God Almighty's, but they
[03:48:39.120 --> 03:48:41.560]  do because they think they're gods on earth.
[03:48:41.560 --> 03:48:44.120]  They've said this multiple times.
[03:48:44.120 --> 03:48:48.040]  I think it's a very important conversation that we're having right here with Celeste
[03:48:48.040 --> 03:48:53.480]  Solem because it's important to understand your enemy and how they actually think, and
[03:48:53.480 --> 03:49:00.040]  how far will humanity go to have to fight to remain human or retain the essence of humanity?
[03:49:00.040 --> 03:49:03.400]  I mean, Celeste, how far down the path are we?
[03:49:04.100 --> 03:49:10.100]  I would say we're at the end game and we have a big decision. Are we going to remain human or not?
[03:49:12.100 --> 03:49:19.100]  For instance, our sexuality, they consider it a construct, a social construct. It is evolutionary.
[03:49:19.100 --> 03:49:28.100]  That's how Karl Marx fits into this whole picture, because Karl Marx was a devotee of Darwin.
[03:49:28.100 --> 03:49:37.100]  And so everything that they're doing is an evolutionary experiment, either directed evolution or experimental evolution.
[03:49:37.100 --> 03:49:46.100]  And so even our sexuality, they are evolving it. And why are they doing this?
[03:49:46.100 --> 03:49:55.100]  To cross the dimensional boundaries. Remember at the beginning, we talked about the barriers that kind of God put in place.
[03:49:55.100 --> 03:50:04.100]  Like my skin is a barrier from lots of bad things. So they want to break the bonds.
[03:50:04.100 --> 03:50:12.100]  In Psalm 2, it talks about humanity throwing off the bonds, the chains that they feel that they have.
[03:50:12.100 --> 03:50:20.100]  And that's what we're seeing. And now it's drilling down to the family, to sexuality, to our individuality.
[03:50:20.100 --> 03:50:34.100]  Who is a person? Who isn't a person? These days, they have defined us right out of any rights, legal rights or privileges or anything.
[03:50:34.100 --> 03:50:41.100]  It is the same model that they used in World War II against certain populations.
[03:50:41.100 --> 03:50:49.100]  They made them like they demonized them. They said they were like apes and that type of thing.
[03:50:49.100 --> 03:50:59.100]  And that's why they went to all this trouble in their therapeutics, vaccinations to mix it with all these different things so they can say.
[03:50:59.100 --> 03:51:06.100]  And there's a person called Bruce Lipton. He's an evolutionist. And he said, you're not human.
[03:51:06.100 --> 03:51:12.100]  You've got more non-human cells in you than you have human.
[03:51:12.100 --> 03:51:18.100]  And that's their take is that we are not human any longer and that we never have been human.
[03:51:18.100 --> 03:51:26.100]  And so we can be tinkered with just like you would play with an ant or a mouse or whatever.
[03:51:26.100 --> 03:51:37.100]  That's the point. Yes. So if these globalists place such little value on human beings, which we've seen how little value they place,
[03:51:37.100 --> 03:51:43.100]  they're actively trying to exterminate us and kill us and cause death and suffering every which way you can imagine,
[03:51:43.100 --> 03:51:46.100]  including mutilate children and tell you that it's really great.
[03:51:46.100 --> 03:51:53.100]  So the thinking of these people that they own us and that we're nothing makes a lot of sense
[03:51:53.100 --> 03:51:57.100]  when you consider all of the other things that they're doing, Celeste.
[03:51:57.100 --> 03:52:06.100]  Absolutely. So have you have you looked into APEEL? It's A-P-E-E-L.
[03:52:06.100 --> 03:52:09.100]  Yes, but please share it with the audience.
[03:52:09.100 --> 03:52:14.100]  But that is so it's a spray on it and to put on your fruit and veg.
[03:52:14.100 --> 03:52:19.100]  We don't do it, but the manufacturers and, you know, when it goes to the big warehouses,
[03:52:19.100 --> 03:52:26.100]  that type of stuff puts it on to increase shelf life up to a year, two years.
[03:52:26.100 --> 03:52:33.100]  But did you know that that technology is based on the technology is actually Medusa?
[03:52:33.100 --> 03:52:42.100]  And that is a Greek god that murdered her children to save the cherry crop.
[03:52:42.100 --> 03:52:46.100]  And this is a cherry based spray now.
[03:52:46.100 --> 03:52:55.100]  So it's got a Greek god, goddess, and that is affiliated with the cherries.
[03:52:55.100 --> 03:52:59.100]  And she murders her children to save the cherry crop.
[03:52:59.100 --> 03:53:07.100]  Now, today, we're putting it on all of our fruits and vegetables to murder our children.
[03:53:07.100 --> 03:53:14.100]  The same to save the planet, to save the planet.
[03:53:14.100 --> 03:53:19.100]  Everything that you're talking about is, you know, incredibly deep.
[03:53:19.100 --> 03:53:23.100]  Celeste, I know it's taken you years and years and thousands upon thousands of hours
[03:53:23.100 --> 03:53:27.100]  of research to come to some of these conclusions.
[03:53:27.100 --> 03:53:33.100]  Just the other day when I mentioned the real-life vampire that Alex was talking about,
[03:53:33.100 --> 03:53:39.100]  and he said, how did every single civilization throughout history come to the conclusion
[03:53:39.100 --> 03:53:43.100]  that there were people, evil people coming in the middle of the night to steal the children
[03:53:43.100 --> 03:53:45.100]  so they could drink their blood?
[03:53:45.100 --> 03:53:50.100]  How did so many societies come to that conclusion and have that story told
[03:53:50.100 --> 03:53:52.100]  throughout their societies?
[03:53:52.100 --> 03:53:57.100]  And the reality is that the globalists and the people that are doing this to us
[03:53:57.100 --> 03:54:00.100]  practice a very, very old religion.
[03:54:00.100 --> 03:54:02.100]  It's essentially Satanism.
[03:54:02.100 --> 03:54:07.100]  These occult practices, something that you're talking about, you found the link to Medusa.
[03:54:07.100 --> 03:54:10.100]  Most people would think that's perhaps far-fetched.
[03:54:10.100 --> 03:54:13.100]  No, this is genuinely what these people live and breathe.
[03:54:13.100 --> 03:54:19.100]  They serve a very, very dark spiritual force.
[03:54:19.100 --> 03:54:20.100]  Absolutely.
[03:54:20.100 --> 03:54:22.100]  I mean, I was pretty horrified.
[03:54:22.100 --> 03:54:24.100]  Everybody was talking about it.
[03:54:24.100 --> 03:54:26.100]  But, you know, that's the thing.
[03:54:26.100 --> 03:54:27.100]  We don't dig.
[03:54:27.100 --> 03:54:35.100]  And I think if we are going to preserve humanity, man and woman are kind,
[03:54:35.100 --> 03:54:38.100]  not our species because that's evolutionary.
[03:54:38.100 --> 03:54:40.100]  Species is evolutionary.
[03:54:40.100 --> 03:54:45.100]  But bottom line, we're kind, man and mankind.
[03:54:45.100 --> 03:54:47.100]  We are going to have to dig.
[03:54:48.100 --> 03:54:55.100]  Somebody let me know this, I think it was just yesterday, that on Campbell's Soup,
[03:54:55.100 --> 03:55:01.100]  now it says this is biotechnology, this is synthetic biology.
[03:55:01.100 --> 03:55:05.100]  On Campbell's Soup, chicken noodle soup, this is the soup that your mother would
[03:55:05.100 --> 03:55:07.100]  give you when you're not feeling good.
[03:55:07.100 --> 03:55:13.100]  And if you don't dig, if you don't learn a little bit about synthetic biology,
[03:55:13.100 --> 03:55:16.100]  you don't have to do what you do and what I do.
[03:55:16.100 --> 03:55:20.100]  But you should have a cursory understanding of it.
[03:55:20.100 --> 03:55:25.100]  I did the webinar for free so that you can have that understanding,
[03:55:25.100 --> 03:55:30.100]  so that you don't get caught in this trap and then all of a sudden you're sick
[03:55:30.100 --> 03:55:38.100]  and you have morbidity, you know, you've got things growing inside of you.
[03:55:38.100 --> 03:55:39.100]  You may have stroke.
[03:55:39.100 --> 03:55:40.100]  You may have heart attack.
[03:55:40.100 --> 03:55:46.100]  You may have many, a plethora of different pain, insomnia.
[03:55:46.100 --> 03:55:52.100]  You need to know that this exists and how to take precaution.
[03:55:52.100 --> 03:55:57.100]  And that's why we all need to do and we all need to press into our creator,
[03:55:57.100 --> 03:56:03.100]  quite frankly, because, quite frankly, in the Bible it says that if Jesus didn't
[03:56:03.100 --> 03:56:06.100]  cut short the days, there would be no flesh left alive.
[03:56:06.100 --> 03:56:08.100]  That's what we're staring at.
[03:56:09.100 --> 03:56:14.100]  And on top of that, we're moving into this sixth extinction level event.
[03:56:14.100 --> 03:56:17.100]  So the elite knew this.
[03:56:17.100 --> 03:56:19.100]  They obscurated it.
[03:56:19.100 --> 03:56:22.100]  They classified a document called the Adam and Eve story.
[03:56:22.100 --> 03:56:27.100]  And then they unclassified it about, I don't know, five or six years ago.
[03:56:27.100 --> 03:56:33.100]  And it tells about what's going to be happening.
[03:56:33.100 --> 03:56:38.100]  And this is a time given the magnetosphere and what's happening on our planet.
[03:56:38.100 --> 03:56:40.100]  This is a very cyclical event.
[03:56:40.100 --> 03:56:45.100]  The last time this happened and we're in it, we're in the very beginning of it,
[03:56:45.100 --> 03:56:50.100]  90% of all life went extinct.
[03:56:50.100 --> 03:56:53.100]  But the elite knew ahead of time.
[03:56:53.100 --> 03:56:56.100]  We didn't know, so we couldn't prepare.
[03:56:56.100 --> 03:56:59.100]  But they got their, they're getting their system.
[03:56:59.100 --> 03:57:01.100]  This is a system.
[03:57:01.100 --> 03:57:06.100]  And synthetic biology is a system, and we have to realize that.
[03:57:06.100 --> 03:57:08.100]  I agree with you, Celeste.
[03:57:08.100 --> 03:57:11.100]  We're almost out of time for today.
[03:57:11.100 --> 03:57:13.100]  I could talk to you literally for hours.
[03:57:13.100 --> 03:57:16.100]  We will definitely speak with you again.
[03:57:16.100 --> 03:57:21.100]  Celeste has released a very, very important series on synthetic biology.
[03:57:21.100 --> 03:57:23.100]  It's a four-part webinar.
[03:57:23.100 --> 03:57:25.100]  I do encourage everyone to go and watch that.
[03:57:25.100 --> 03:57:26.100]  You can find her on Rumble.
[03:57:26.100 --> 03:57:29.100]  Her website is also CelestialReport.com.
[03:57:29.100 --> 03:57:34.100]  Just amazing information, amazing research, and most of all, faith in Jesus,
[03:57:34.100 --> 03:57:37.100]  which is what we need to get us through this and preserve mankind.
[03:57:37.100 --> 03:57:40.100]  And I know God will give us the strength to do the right thing.
[03:57:40.100 --> 03:57:42.100]  Thank you so much for tuning in today.
[03:57:42.100 --> 03:57:44.100]  Please continue to support InfoWars.
[03:57:44.100 --> 03:57:46.100]  See you soon.
[03:57:46.100 --> 03:57:49.100]  InfoWars is a one-of-a-kind operation.

[03:57:52.100 --> 03:57:54.100]  And you can make it one time or recurring.
[03:57:55.100 --> 03:57:56.100]  You have a little profile there.
[03:57:56.100 --> 03:57:58.100]  Cancel anytime.
[03:57:58.100 --> 03:58:03.100]  Every 15 days, every month, every three months, every six months, up to nine months,
[03:58:03.100 --> 03:58:07.100]  you can go in and every month or every week, whenever you want, you program it.
[03:58:07.100 --> 03:58:10.100]  You just click it, and then you decide when you want to make a donation.
[03:58:10.100 --> 03:58:11.100]  So please do that as well.
[03:58:11.100 --> 03:58:16.100]  That way we get 95% of it after credit card fees instead of making 20%, 30%, 40% like we do on the products.
[03:58:16.100 --> 03:58:18.100]  But these really are amazing products.
[03:58:18.100 --> 03:58:20.100]  The big July 4th sale is going on right now.
[03:58:20.100 --> 03:58:23.100]  This is such a critical platform in the fight against the New World Order.
[03:58:23.100 --> 03:58:25.100]  Enemies out in the open were vindicated.
[03:58:25.100 --> 03:58:26.100]  People are listening more than ever.
[03:58:26.100 --> 03:58:31.100]  But in this major recession going into depression and with supply chain breakdowns, I know it's hard.
[03:58:31.100 --> 03:58:32.100]  I know times are tough.
[03:58:32.100 --> 03:58:34.100]  So thank you for your support.
[03:58:34.100 --> 03:58:37.100]  But whatever you do, pray for the broadcast and share the articles and the videos.
[03:58:37.100 --> 03:58:39.100]  That you can do for free.
[03:58:39.100 --> 03:58:41.100]  And that's just as important as keeping us on air.
[03:58:41.100 --> 03:58:44.100]  So however God leads you in your heart to support us, please support us now.
[03:58:44.100 --> 03:58:46.100]  And I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[03:58:46.100 --> 03:58:47.100]  God bless you.
[03:58:47.100 --> 03:58:53.100]  I want to say brain force is great.
[03:58:53.100 --> 03:58:55.100]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[03:58:55.100 --> 03:58:56.100]  It is.
[03:58:56.100 --> 03:59:00.100]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[03:59:00.100 --> 03:59:02.100]  The fish oil is better than it.
[03:59:02.100 --> 03:59:04.100]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[03:59:04.100 --> 03:59:06.100]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[03:59:06.100 --> 03:59:09.100]  Brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[03:59:09.100 --> 03:59:11.100]  Krill oils is the best.
[03:59:11.100 --> 03:59:12.100]  And it'll give you the damn burps.
[03:59:12.100 --> 03:59:13.100]  And I'm sorry.
[03:59:13.100 --> 03:59:14.100]  You want something like this?
[03:59:14.100 --> 03:59:15.100]  You don't get stuff for free.
[03:59:15.100 --> 03:59:17.100]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[03:59:17.100 --> 03:59:18.100]  It's so good in my view.
[03:59:18.100 --> 03:59:19.100]  I'm not making a medical statement here.
[03:59:19.100 --> 03:59:20.100]  But let me tell you something.
[03:59:20.100 --> 03:59:23.100]  And I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[03:59:23.100 --> 03:59:25.100]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[03:59:26.100 --> 03:59:31.100]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[03:59:34.100 --> 03:59:36.100]  So we don't make a big profit off of it.
[03:59:36.100 --> 03:59:37.100]  But you notice I just obsess.
[03:59:37.100 --> 03:59:40.100]  Because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[03:59:40.100 --> 03:59:41.100]  I just can't do it.
