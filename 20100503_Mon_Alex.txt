[00:00:04.813 --> 00:00:06.114]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.114 --> 00:00:07.895]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.895 --> 00:00:09.656]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.656 --> 00:00:11.237]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.237 --> 00:00:12.779]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:16.982]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.982 --> 00:00:21.025]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.191]  Your name is Tom.
[00:00:24.191 --> 00:00:26.213]  You live just off of 5th Street.
[00:00:26.213 --> 00:00:27.474]  Nice car, Tom.
[00:00:27.474 --> 00:00:28.375]  Nice house.
[00:00:28.375 --> 00:00:35.061]  What's not so nice is you owe Pennsylvania $4,212 in back taxes.
[00:00:35.061 --> 00:00:36.222]  Listen, Tom.
[00:00:36.222 --> 00:00:37.843]  We can make this easy.
[00:00:37.843 --> 00:00:44.289]  Pay online by June 18th, and we'll skip your penalty and take half off your interest.
[00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:47.612]  Because, Tom, we do know who you are.
[00:00:50.714 --> 00:01:01.385]  Because, Tom, we are a terrorist government run by foreign banks that have looted hundreds of other nations, and we're going to take everything you've got, Tom, and we want to intimidate you, Tom.
[00:01:01.385 --> 00:01:05.870]  That's what the black ski mask and cameras on every street corner are about, Tom.
[00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:11.796]  That's why we're spiking your water with poison, Tom, to make you lethargic and cancer-prone, Tom.
[00:01:13.277 --> 00:01:26.032]  I remember in the last five years they've run similar ads in England and they've got these big posters up all over London and other cities saying secure under the watchful eye of Big Brother.
[00:01:26.032 --> 00:01:29.115]  They're saying Big Brother is good.
[00:01:29.115 --> 00:01:30.397]  We're God, Tom.
[00:01:30.397 --> 00:01:31.958]  We're watching you from space.
[00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:33.080]  You're a little man, Tom.
[00:01:35.322 --> 00:01:39.426]  That's what the IRS in Pennsylvania is doing.
[00:01:39.426 --> 00:01:43.189]  They're a state internal revenue service.
[00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:45.731]  We're gonna jack your taxes up, Tom.
[00:01:45.731 --> 00:01:48.874]  We don't care if you've lost your house, Tom.
[00:01:48.874 --> 00:01:50.696]  Nice house, nice car.
[00:01:50.696 --> 00:01:52.477]  We're gangsters.
[00:01:52.477 --> 00:01:54.699]  This is a nice grocery store you got here.
[00:01:54.699 --> 00:01:58.502]  Better pay us protection or somebody's gonna burn it down.
[00:01:58.502 --> 00:02:00.004]  You know what I'm saying to you?
[00:02:01.476 --> 00:02:03.757]  We'll be discussing this today.
[00:02:03.757 --> 00:02:15.621]  I'm going to try to be extremely calm throughout the full four hours because that's the only way I'll be able to cover the gargantuan amount of incredibly vital news and information.
[00:02:15.621 --> 00:02:24.504]  We're seeing more New World Order in your face behavior every day than I would see in a year 15 years ago when I first got on air.
[00:02:25.726 --> 00:02:32.328]  It is an orgy of robbing and looting and intimidation and corruption.
[00:02:32.328 --> 00:02:34.249]  The government has gone bad.
[00:02:34.249 --> 00:02:37.770]  99% of the time in history, that's what happens.
[00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.191]  This one's gone really, really bad.
[00:02:41.191 --> 00:02:44.572]  We are in societal trouble.
[00:02:44.572 --> 00:02:46.712]  We have got to cut the size of government.
[00:02:46.712 --> 00:02:48.673]  We've got to stop trusting the government.
[00:02:48.673 --> 00:02:51.374]  We've got to realize how criminal it is.
[00:02:52.813 --> 00:02:57.834]  Big Brother Tax Collection Commercial airs in Pennsylvania.
[00:02:57.834 --> 00:03:07.876]  We posted this on Saturday when Keith Farrell, who lives in that area, one of our writers, first noticed it.
[00:03:07.876 --> 00:03:10.536]  And it has gone super viral on the web.
[00:03:10.536 --> 00:03:14.237]  It is all over major news sites now.
[00:03:14.237 --> 00:03:19.198]  But the Huffington Post and others are saying, hey, look, this is a good idea.
[00:03:19.198 --> 00:03:20.078]  We've got to raise money.
[00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:24.010]  That's what the commenters are saying on their site.
[00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.951]  Other sites are horrified.
[00:03:25.951 --> 00:03:27.792]  We're going to be breaking this down.
[00:03:27.792 --> 00:03:33.075]  Orwellian Big Brother Tax Collection Commercial airs in Pennsylvania.
[00:03:33.075 --> 00:03:38.719]  We're going to go live at PrisonPlanet.tv so we can play all these videos so you can actually see them, not just hear them.
[00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:40.801]  I don't think so.
[00:03:58.937 --> 00:04:05.202]  And broke them internationally on BBC, their plan to bankrupt the third world and the first world.
[00:04:05.202 --> 00:04:11.846]  We'll be talking to Greg Pallis coming up in the third hour today.
[00:04:11.846 --> 00:04:15.529]  Separately, this really is the top story.
[00:04:15.529 --> 00:04:22.254]  And I'm going to cover this first after I go over some of the other news we'll be detailing later in the transmission.
[00:04:22.254 --> 00:04:26.477]  All over the United States, illegal aliens and their support groups
[00:04:28.675 --> 00:04:36.780]  Attacked buildings, set fire to buildings, beat people up, and it's in the mainstream news, but buried in the articles.
[00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:45.106]  They report it kind of like, oh, hey, it's supposed to be sunny 76 today with a chance of breezy winds by 5 p.m.
[00:04:45.106 --> 00:04:47.207]  It's like, oh, they had torches.
[00:04:47.207 --> 00:04:50.129]  They were burning down part of the downtown area.
[00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:53.891]  Yeah, they attacked some tea partiers, but they deserved it.
[00:04:53.891 --> 00:04:56.853]  And I've got TV clubs where they're like, well, the people are angry.
[00:04:56.853 --> 00:04:57.894]  This is pretty reasonable.
[00:05:00.785 --> 00:05:03.688]  Max, what did you do with the remote?
[00:05:03.688 --> 00:05:05.129]  Now what am I going to do?
[00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:07.291]  I guess I can go online to find a new one.
[00:05:07.291 --> 00:05:09.232]  Okay, here's a site.
[00:05:09.232 --> 00:05:10.954]  Replacementremotes.com.

[00:05:13.656 --> 00:05:16.478]  Well, I guess they can't repair this one.
[00:05:16.478 --> 00:05:18.200]  Thanks, Max.
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.442]  Wow, they have my original remote!
[00:05:21.133 --> 00:05:23.716]  And an exact replacement that doesn't need programming.

[00:06:04.816 --> 00:06:06.076]  Tyranny is here.
[00:06:06.076 --> 00:06:09.717]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:06:09.717 --> 00:06:12.238]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:06:12.238 --> 00:06:18.100]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states on Earth.
[00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:24.761]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:06:24.761 --> 00:06:30.283]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:06:30.743 --> 00:06:34.925]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:06:34.925 --> 00:06:39.207]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:06:39.207 --> 00:06:45.170]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:48.711]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:06:48.711 --> 00:06:50.692]  The Police State isn't coming.
[00:06:50.692 --> 00:06:51.813]  It's here.

[00:06:59.952 --> 00:07:05.797]  Did you know there is a growing number of researchers who agree that 90% of all disease begins in the colon?
[00:07:05.797 --> 00:07:11.002]  Did you know that 80% of all Americans suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[00:07:11.002 --> 00:07:13.865]  If allowed, our bodies are capable of healing themselves.
[00:07:13.865 --> 00:07:19.630]  The key to optimal health is not only what we eat, but also a healthy digestive system and a strong immune system.
[00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:28.997]  At Freshwater Organics, we offer FPP, a daily organic supplement that helps eliminate parasites, heavy metals, and high cholesterol naturally and safely.

[00:08:24.584 --> 00:08:28.425]  Saturday was May Day.
[00:08:28.425 --> 00:08:32.206]  It was May 1st, 2010.
[00:08:32.206 --> 00:08:36.026]  International Workers' Communist Day.
[00:08:36.026 --> 00:08:38.627]  That's officially what it is.
[00:08:38.627 --> 00:08:50.649]  And in almost every case, when you research the development of communism, the promotion of it, the big, powerful central banks and the royalty of Europe needed a way to destroy the free market.
[00:08:51.701 --> 00:08:53.942]  And so all over the United States, in San Francisco,
[00:09:21.305 --> 00:09:25.666]  This is from abcnews.com.
[00:09:25.666 --> 00:09:31.827]  Thousands across Bay Area protest Arizona immigration law on Saturday.
[00:09:31.827 --> 00:09:42.110]  And buried in the article, they just calmly report that the illegal aliens beat up a counter May Day march of Tea Party people.
[00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:48.671]  They just announced, buried in the article, that the illegal aliens and their supporters were beating up US citizens.
[00:09:52.285 --> 00:09:56.068]  Separately, riot breaks out in downtown Santa Cruz.
[00:09:56.068 --> 00:09:57.689]  This is Santa Cruz Sentinel.
[00:09:57.689 --> 00:09:59.890]  Windows broken on dozens of businesses.
[00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:02.132]  Porch of cafes set on fire.
[00:10:02.132 --> 00:10:08.596]  A large group of protesters marching with burning torches attacked Saturday evening.
[00:10:08.596 --> 00:10:10.497]  With burning torches.
[00:10:10.497 --> 00:10:11.298]  Here's another one.
[00:10:11.298 --> 00:10:12.819]  Star Tribune.
[00:10:12.819 --> 00:10:15.320]  18 businesses damaged after immigrants' rights march.
[00:10:16.221 --> 00:10:18.827]  ...turns violent in Santa Cruz, California.
[00:10:18.827 --> 00:10:20.250]  Now, you have to dig around.
[00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:24.419]  There are scores of articles on this, but only a couple of them admit it's illegal aliens.
[00:10:24.419 --> 00:10:26.082]  And I've got several TV newscasts...
[00:10:27.116 --> 00:10:28.157]  We're good to go.
[00:10:57.656 --> 00:11:00.918]  On Cafe, set on fire.
[00:11:00.918 --> 00:11:01.999]  Here's the AP.
[00:11:01.999 --> 00:11:07.402]  18 businesses damaged after immigrants' rights march turns violent in Santa Cruz, California.
[00:11:07.402 --> 00:11:10.104]  Now the media spun it that it was anarchist.
[00:11:10.104 --> 00:11:12.305]  Anarchy is the opposite of communist.
[00:11:12.305 --> 00:11:21.330]  You have a communist, illegal alien, farm workers' rights march out there, and they start setting fire to buildings.
[00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:22.551]  Fires!
[00:11:22.551 --> 00:11:25.393]  And you have to... I had to spend 20 minutes this morning to find that.
[00:11:26.013 --> 00:11:31.937]  As soon as I saw the news saying it was anarchist and it was spontaneous, I knew that was a lie from watching the video.
[00:11:31.937 --> 00:11:34.780]  A bunch of illegal aliens running around, burning stuff.
[00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:44.166]  And so I went and did a search for immigrant march, Santa Cruz, and boom, there it was in the AP.
[00:11:44.166 --> 00:11:44.847]  Here's another one.
[00:11:44.847 --> 00:11:46.128]  San Jose Mercury News.
[00:11:46.128 --> 00:11:47.949]  Riot breaks out in downtown Santa Cruz.
[00:11:47.949 --> 00:11:49.791]  Windows broken on dozens of businesses.
[00:11:49.791 --> 00:11:51.432]  Porch on Cafe set on fire.
[00:11:53.066 --> 00:11:57.950]  Here's the PrisonPlanet.com article that's very important for people to get out.
[00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:00.353]  It just went up in the last 15 minutes.
[00:12:00.353 --> 00:12:02.935]  Hot off the presses, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:12:02.935 --> 00:12:10.322]  Corporate media plays down pro-illegal immigration thugs who terrorize Santa Cruz.
[00:12:11.565 --> 00:12:18.850]  Imagine the national uproar if 200 Tea Partiers had gone on a rampage with burning torches.
[00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:26.055]  Now, that is the headline up at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:12:26.055 --> 00:12:36.401]  And it is vital, absolutely vital, to get this article out to everyone so they understand the nature of what we face.
[00:12:36.401 --> 00:12:38.263]  30 million illegal aliens in this country
[00:12:39.366 --> 00:12:47.628]  Being enraged by the media telling them that they've been wronged are now in the nation openly discussing violence.
[00:12:47.628 --> 00:12:54.371]  Remember last week in Arizona when they attacked police and Tea Party people and then said we're going to use our pickaxes to kill you?
[00:12:54.371 --> 00:12:56.811]  And that was only in the local news?
[00:12:56.811 --> 00:12:58.892]  They're playing this down right now?
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:03.923]  We're going to use our pickaxes to kill you.
[00:13:03.923 --> 00:13:08.307]  In fact, I'm going to call Watson and have him add that video into this.
[00:13:08.307 --> 00:13:10.890]  Oh, he actually has it, I tell you.
[00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:11.811]  That's why I love Watson.
[00:13:11.811 --> 00:13:12.832]  We're right on the same page.
[00:13:12.832 --> 00:13:14.273]  He's got the video at the bottom.
[00:13:14.273 --> 00:13:16.335]  Illegals threaten to murder Americans with axes.
[00:13:18.157 --> 00:13:19.578]  So that's at the bottom.
[00:13:19.578 --> 00:13:22.059]  This article is so important.
[00:13:22.059 --> 00:13:38.966]  He's also got the local newscast from ABC7 News in the article where you can hear shop owners shouting over the live news feed, you know, stop the cover-up, illegal aliens did this, deport illegal aliens.
[00:13:49.142 --> 00:13:56.991]  So, I ask you now, ladies and gentlemen, are you going to put up with this?
[00:13:56.991 --> 00:14:09.805]  You have a criminal, illegitimate government that's been captured and taken over by offshore central banks that are openly announcing a world government and the end of every nation's sovereignty so that no nation can stand up to their supremacy.
[00:14:10.666 --> 00:14:24.610]  And you've got in Europe and the United States and in England giant groups of illegal aliens that have been brought in who are then filled full of hatred of the nation and are being used as a political weapon who are threatening to burn down U.S.
[00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:29.612]  cities if they're not given complete and total amnesty.
[00:14:29.612 --> 00:14:39.455]  This is the death of the Republic that we are talking about if these individuals are able to get away with this.
[00:14:42.765 --> 00:14:56.993]  Just imagine what would happen if Tea Party individuals, if 200 plus Tea Party people marched with torches, set fire to buildings, and knocked out the windows of 18 businesses and physically attacked people.
[00:14:56.993 --> 00:14:58.834]  That's buried in some of the articles.
[00:14:58.834 --> 00:15:02.797]  Physically attacked people.
[00:15:02.797 --> 00:15:05.178]  Arson is attempted murder.
[00:15:05.178 --> 00:15:07.620]  If I lit a torch, Alex Jones,
[00:15:08.502 --> 00:15:15.665]  And I walked into downtown Austin, which I would never do, and set fire to businesses full of people.
[00:15:15.665 --> 00:15:21.368]  I would be charged with attempted murder, and I should be charged with attempted murder.
[00:15:21.368 --> 00:15:23.729]  You talk about pitchforks and torches.
[00:15:23.729 --> 00:15:29.111]  Going back to Europe, the population was disarmed, so they used fire as a weapon.
[00:15:31.226 --> 00:15:36.048]  Now, you've got the media saying that the Tea Partiers and anybody that wants to audit the Fed are terrorists.
[00:15:36.048 --> 00:15:45.713]  You've got the Army being trained to take on Tea Partiers in drills where mock Tea Party individuals, played by the police, pose as terrorists that want to kill the military.
[00:15:45.713 --> 00:15:49.956]  You have the military and the police being taught this literal fable.
[00:15:49.956 --> 00:15:59.921]  You have a militia, to add weight to this, busted and clearly set up because one guy shot his mouth off and said one day we may have to have a war with the government.
[00:16:01.211 --> 00:16:10.714]  And the media for a month has been shaking in its boots and teaching everyone to be in fear and to climb under their beds from the boogeyman of the militias and gun owners.
[00:16:10.714 --> 00:16:29.101]  Meanwhile, you've got groups beating people up in San Francisco, setting fire to buildings in Santa Cruz, attacking police with heavy objects, cans of Coca-Cola, and their fist, and the police stand down in Phoenix, Arizona, and the media plays it down.
[00:16:30.066 --> 00:16:39.259]  And on May Day, you have a crude moron bomb with propane and some fireworks and what looks like a children's clock.
[00:16:40.777 --> 00:16:48.343]  Set up in Times Square, and the media is acting like Godzilla just came out of the Atlantic Ocean and destroyed New York City.
[00:16:48.343 --> 00:17:03.816]  Teaching you to just shake and quake in fear, and first they said Al-Qaeda did it, and then an Israeli front group put out a video that's been proven to be fake, and now they admit, okay, it wasn't Al-Qaeda or Taliban, and oh, we're looking at Tea Partiers, was it right-wingers?
[00:17:03.816 --> 00:17:04.676]  It was May 1st.
[00:17:07.106 --> 00:17:09.679]  It was May 1st.
[00:17:09.679 --> 00:17:10.824]  It was Communist Day.
[00:17:12.728 --> 00:17:24.210]  Was some commie provocateur-ed, like a FBI informant out of Austin a few years ago, provocateur-ed on attempted firebombing at the RNC in Minneapolis-St.
[00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:25.190]  Paul?
[00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:27.691]  That's come out that they completely provocateur-ed that?
[00:17:27.691 --> 00:17:28.811]  We don't know.
[00:17:28.811 --> 00:17:32.992]  But why isn't the media putting 2 plus 2 day 1?
[00:17:32.992 --> 00:17:37.373]  I mean, I saw this news Saturday evening, and I said, it's a May Day.
[00:17:37.373 --> 00:17:39.273]  If it isn't staged, it's a commie.
[00:17:40.253 --> 00:17:44.497]  But the news said, Al-Qaeda, Iran, Pakistan, we've got to have war.
[00:17:44.497 --> 00:17:47.420]  They're behind it, Ahmadinejad, he's done it.
[00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:57.231]  And then I was listening to the press conference yesterday with the commissioner, chief of police, and the dumbfounded governor up there, and the media over and over again said,
[00:17:58.442 --> 00:18:00.824]  Do we need to put restrictions on propane?
[00:18:00.824 --> 00:18:04.066]  Do we need to make you have a license to have gasoline?
[00:18:04.066 --> 00:18:06.448]  And the police said, we're looking at that.
[00:18:06.448 --> 00:18:11.252]  Oh my gosh, we're... Yeah, let's have a license in every home that has natural gas coming into it.
[00:18:11.252 --> 00:18:16.176]  Because every once in a while, somebody strikes a match and leaves the gas on and the house blows up.
[00:18:16.176 --> 00:18:19.739]  Let's ban cars, because somebody might use a car as a weapon, and they do.
[00:18:19.739 --> 00:18:21.060]  Let's ban baseball bats.
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:25.403]  Thousands a year are killed in North America alone with baseball bats.
[00:18:25.403 --> 00:18:26.864]  Let's ban 2x4s.
[00:18:26.864 --> 00:18:29.646]  Let's have a waiting period on everything.
[00:18:29.646 --> 00:18:32.669]  That's the message, is be a bunch of ninnying cowards.
[00:18:32.669 --> 00:18:35.571]  Shake in your boots.
[00:18:35.571 --> 00:18:36.772]  Be afraid of everything.
[00:18:36.772 --> 00:18:38.413]  Be very afraid.
[00:18:38.413 --> 00:18:41.776]  We've got to ban or restrict something or the terrorists will get us.
[00:18:41.776 --> 00:18:45.839]  Oh my gosh, Al-Qaeda, save us from Al-Qaeda.
[00:18:45.839 --> 00:18:50.622]  Meanwhile, I did a search this morning and found a bunch of other articles.
[00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:59.932]  From Texas, and New York, and Florida, where windows got knocked out and banks got attacked.
[00:18:59.932 --> 00:19:04.593]  I don't know why the communists are attacking banks, that's who's financing you.
[00:19:04.593 --> 00:19:08.914]  But it's all here in the news.
[00:19:08.914 --> 00:19:10.154]  In fact, here's another one.
[00:19:10.154 --> 00:19:13.235]  Albuquerque banks hit by brazen vandals.
[00:19:15.506 --> 00:19:21.549]  Just, just, just, just pouring in with the media doing everything they can to cover this up.
[00:19:21.549 --> 00:19:41.719]  People running around saying, we're going to murder you with axes, we're going to burn down your cities, we're going to engage in the plan of San Diego to kill all whites, we're going to get you, we're for communism, we're going to burn down buildings, and the media, in this particular ABC newscast, they interviewed two people going, well folks are upset, they got a few things to be mad about.
[00:19:42.259 --> 00:19:44.420]  I'm kind of proud of what they did.
[00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:45.020]  That's right.
[00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:50.042]  Families in a restaurant that barely escaped the flames.
[00:19:50.042 --> 00:19:53.564]  I mean, you know, you need to kill a few yuppies.
[00:19:53.564 --> 00:19:54.744]  I mean, this is wonderful.
[00:19:54.744 --> 00:19:55.964]  I'm politically correct.
[00:19:55.964 --> 00:19:58.385]  I think this is beautiful what they did.
[00:19:58.385 --> 00:19:59.606]  This is totally sick.
[00:20:00.925 --> 00:20:07.927]  It's no secret why pharmaceutical companies and mainstream media often question the safety and effectiveness of herbal supplements.
[00:20:07.927 --> 00:20:16.529]  But isn't it ironic that mainstream pharmaceutical companies are the ones who manufacture overpriced prescription drugs that produce dangerous side effects?
[00:20:16.529 --> 00:20:21.310]  Do your own research and compare the herbal supplements offered at ResearchedHerbs.com.
[00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:21.850]  I think so.
[00:20:39.605 --> 00:20:40.206]  We're good to go.
[00:21:00.086 --> 00:21:03.048]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[00:21:03.048 --> 00:21:07.190]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or at worst depression?
[00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:09.471]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[00:21:09.471 --> 00:21:14.633]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[00:21:14.633 --> 00:21:16.454]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[00:21:16.454 --> 00:21:17.995]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[00:21:17.995 --> 00:21:19.476]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[00:21:19.476 --> 00:21:22.857]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[00:21:22.857 --> 00:21:27.880]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common-sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:28.601]  We're good to go.
[00:21:45.998 --> 00:21:46.518]  We're good.
[00:22:00.347 --> 00:22:06.532]  The new World Order Beast is genetically modifying your food.
[00:22:06.532 --> 00:22:12.958]  Mixing vegetables with animals and now experimenting with viruses.
[00:22:12.958 --> 00:22:18.683]  Without a long-term food solution, you will have just two options.
[00:22:18.683 --> 00:22:21.665]  Starve or surrender.
[00:22:21.665 --> 00:22:25.469]  All canned food supplies will eventually run out.
[00:22:25.469 --> 00:22:26.349]  What then?
[00:22:29.073 --> 00:22:32.136]  Grow your own healthy food and feed your family forever.
[00:22:32.136 --> 00:22:36.479]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is now the nation's largest bulk heirloom seed company.
[00:22:36.479 --> 00:22:39.341]  And it's owned by a real patriot, Big John Lipscomb.
[00:22:39.341 --> 00:22:46.567]  You can now have an infinite amount of healthy vegetables like a watermelon, a bundle of carrots, or tomatoes for a little more than a penny each.
[00:22:46.567 --> 00:22:48.469]  SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[00:22:48.469 --> 00:22:53.873]  And now you can go into business with Big John at SurvivalistSeeds.com by becoming an affiliate.
[00:22:53.873 --> 00:22:56.595]  See his link at SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[00:22:56.595 --> 00:22:57.396]  SurvivalistSeeds.com.
[00:23:00.413 --> 00:23:01.174]  The problem.
[00:23:01.174 --> 00:23:03.735]  How do I cook food without power?
[00:23:03.735 --> 00:23:06.457]  How do I light my home with no electricity?
[00:23:06.457 --> 00:23:09.119]  How do I get emergency radio broadcasts?
[00:23:09.119 --> 00:23:11.621]  How can I make safe drinking water?
[00:23:11.621 --> 00:23:20.627]  When your power goes out, the solution for cooking, baking, home lighting, listening to the radio, and producing clean water is the Family Emergency Kit from KeroStove.
[00:23:20.627 --> 00:23:24.770]  KeroStove has been in business for over 12 years with the largest selection of kerosene
[00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:25.511]  We're good to go!
[00:23:41.575 --> 00:23:49.862]  That's 888-395-1164 and ask about weekly specials or check the specials online each week at kerostove.com.
[00:23:49.862 --> 00:23:55.286]  Again, call 888-395-1164 or go to kerostove.com.
[00:23:55.286 --> 00:23:58.369]  KeroStove, for family emergency solutions.
[00:24:06.769 --> 00:24:14.013]  So, you get a diffused dud car bomb on May Day in Times Square, New York City.
[00:24:14.013 --> 00:24:22.898]  You get illegals rioting and beating people up all over the nation, attacking police, and it's not a national news story.
[00:24:23.718 --> 00:24:27.601]  It basically goes into the memory hole.
[00:24:27.601 --> 00:24:33.825]  And you have Santa Cruz with people attacking 18 businesses and setting fires.
[00:24:33.825 --> 00:24:45.334]  The police were completely overwhelmed because they knew that they were going to have this march, but the police just didn't send any extra officers because you can only send those to the bingo playing tea partiers.
[00:24:45.854 --> 00:24:52.417]  You know, mainly old men and old ladies out there that are so deadly dangerous, they don't want their pension funds taken for bank or bailouts.
[00:24:52.417 --> 00:25:01.960]  You've got to have riot police there on hand and sniper teams and sound cannon weapons and sometimes regular army out there for the tea parties.
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:04.821]  But you can't have it for the illegal aliens.
[00:25:04.821 --> 00:25:06.262]  No, sir.
[00:25:06.262 --> 00:25:08.323]  And you can't have it in the national news.
[00:25:09.875 --> 00:25:15.023]  Well, this will become national news if you get this article up at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:25:15.023 --> 00:25:18.568]  Pro-illegal immigration thugs terrorize Santa Cruz.
[00:25:18.568 --> 00:25:20.150]  Corporate media shrugs.
[00:25:21.069 --> 00:25:30.595]  And then the sub-headline says, imagine the national uproar of 200 Tea Partiers had gone on a rampage with burning torches.
[00:25:30.595 --> 00:25:44.504]  The alternative media must get this story out because then the article ties in to some of the other violence that has popped up around the country.
[00:25:44.504 --> 00:25:46.185]  Like San Francisco.
[00:25:46.185 --> 00:25:50.408]  In fact, does Watson, does Watson have the San Francisco part in here?
[00:25:52.557 --> 00:26:00.343]  Carl Watson, heavy man at the ABC News, headlined, Thousands Across Bay Area Protest Arizona Immigration Law.
[00:26:00.343 --> 00:26:10.612]  And in that article it talks about the immigrant rights supporters followed two partiers to a BART station on Market Street and started punching and kicking them and calling them names.
[00:26:10.612 --> 00:26:12.734]  This was all caught on video.
[00:26:12.734 --> 00:26:16.196]  And then it just goes on from there, other physical attacks.
[00:26:16.196 --> 00:26:16.497]  We need to
[00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:19.251]  Put it all up there.
[00:26:19.251 --> 00:26:21.212]  And we can't track all this.
[00:26:21.212 --> 00:26:22.072]  There's too much of it.
[00:26:22.072 --> 00:26:31.676]  So, send it to ShowTipsAtInfoWars.com if it was locally on your news with the illegal alien racist attacking the devil gringo.
[00:26:31.676 --> 00:26:32.817]  Just randomly.
[00:26:32.817 --> 00:26:34.097]  Oh, you're an evil American.
[00:26:34.097 --> 00:26:36.118]  Let me punch you in the face.
[00:26:36.118 --> 00:26:37.319]  Let me burn down your business.
[00:26:37.319 --> 00:26:40.060]  Oh, you got families in a restaurant eating dinner?
[00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:44.482]  Here, let's just pour gasoline on the front door and torch the place.
[00:26:44.482 --> 00:26:46.042]  Oh, there you go!
[00:26:46.042 --> 00:26:46.703]  Civil rights!
[00:26:48.141 --> 00:26:48.861]  Oh, how cute!
[00:26:48.861 --> 00:26:50.062]  How sweet!
[00:26:50.062 --> 00:26:56.245]  And where is the media looking at the number one suspects of the failed truck bomb?
[00:26:56.245 --> 00:26:56.725]  Mayday!
[00:26:56.725 --> 00:27:00.567]  This happened on Mayday!
[00:27:00.567 --> 00:27:07.590]  And we now have a white male, standing by the car, suspiciously changing his shirt.
[00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:17.035]  He does look suspicious, I've watched the video, and then he sneakily looks back at the blue truck, the blue SUV, as he sneaks off, seconds before the fire starts in it.
[00:27:18.826 --> 00:27:22.189]  Are they gonna say he's a tea partier?
[00:27:22.189 --> 00:27:24.992]  Are we bracing for that?
[00:27:24.992 --> 00:27:27.674]  Is that what's gonna happen?
[00:27:27.674 --> 00:27:28.996]  Who knows?
[00:27:28.996 --> 00:27:31.678]  We're going to find out soon enough.
[00:27:31.678 --> 00:27:37.604]  You can be assured of that, unless it was a real communist attempted bombing, and then you'll never hear about it.
[00:27:40.216 --> 00:27:44.602]  But if they can set up some conservative or libertarian, you better believe you're going to hear it.
[00:27:44.602 --> 00:27:47.106]  But you're not seeing this on the national news.
[00:27:47.106 --> 00:27:56.179]  Right after illegal aliens attack police and citizens outside the Arizona Capitol building, this is the types of things they had to say.
[00:27:57.435 --> 00:27:59.118]  We will not stop!
[00:28:13.187 --> 00:28:14.248]  You hear that?
[00:28:14.248 --> 00:28:16.230]  We will use our axes against you.
[00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:18.892]  Well, ma'am, we believe you.
[00:28:18.892 --> 00:28:19.993]  I mean, you're
[00:28:34.275 --> 00:28:36.116]  And racial attacks everywhere.
[00:28:36.116 --> 00:28:37.756]  I have it in the minifilm.
[00:28:37.756 --> 00:28:38.516]  It's the extra.
[00:28:38.516 --> 00:28:42.897]  In fact, I ought to replay that today on air.
[00:28:42.897 --> 00:28:46.818]  Battle for the Republic.
[00:28:46.818 --> 00:28:51.780]  And it shows a march in Seattle, Washington in 2007.
[00:28:56.778 --> 00:29:01.581]  And the illegal alien march has blocked a major road for more than 30 minutes.
[00:29:01.581 --> 00:29:03.402]  There's a traffic jam.
[00:29:03.402 --> 00:29:08.224]  And a guy starts shouting back at them out of his sunroof.
[00:29:08.224 --> 00:29:11.826]  And the police come over and tell him, you're not allowed to counter-protest.
[00:29:11.826 --> 00:29:14.268]  Though it was an unauthorized march.
[00:29:14.268 --> 00:29:15.829]  Which is fine, that's the First Amendment.
[00:29:15.829 --> 00:29:18.430]  Though they were blocking the main highway.
[00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:19.691]  They should have been just on the sidewalks.
[00:29:20.899 --> 00:29:34.508]  Regardless, the police pull him out, slam his head in the ground, he's not resisting, blood pours out, the illegals come around and dance around his bleeding body in a demonic celebration.
[00:29:34.508 --> 00:29:39.171]  Because the illegals know, they've got the bankers, they've got the government behind them.
[00:29:39.171 --> 00:29:45.475]  And they are a weapon to vote for gun control, to vote for open borders, to vote to take the middle class private property.
[00:29:45.475 --> 00:29:46.656]  And they're coming.
[00:29:46.656 --> 00:29:48.938]  And they can't stand the fact that we are standing up.
[00:29:50.816 --> 00:29:54.739]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.739 --> 00:30:00.823]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.823 --> 00:30:03.825]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:30:03.825 --> 00:30:09.169]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:30:09.169 --> 00:30:11.211]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:30:11.211 --> 00:30:16.214]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:30:16.214 --> 00:30:17.395]  How much do you want?
[00:30:17.395 --> 00:30:18.136]  When do you want it?
[00:30:18.496 --> 00:30:20.376]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:30:20.376 --> 00:30:21.457]  When will you need it?
[00:30:21.457 --> 00:30:23.657]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:30:23.657 --> 00:30:24.998]  Will there be any food?
[00:30:24.998 --> 00:30:26.518]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:30:26.518 --> 00:30:31.799]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:30:31.799 --> 00:30:35.380]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:38.841]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:30:39.201 --> 00:30:40.422]  How much will you need?
[00:30:40.422 --> 00:30:41.322]  We don't know.
[00:30:41.322 --> 00:30:42.423]  How much do you want?
[00:30:42.423 --> 00:30:43.363]  All you can get.
[00:30:43.363 --> 00:30:44.464]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:30:44.464 --> 00:30:47.506]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:30:47.506 --> 00:30:50.627]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:30:50.627 --> 00:30:51.408]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:31:00.794 --> 00:31:03.096]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:31:03.096 --> 00:31:05.497]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:31:05.497 --> 00:31:08.720]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:13.823]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:31:13.823 --> 00:31:18.006]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:31:18.326 --> 00:31:20.669]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:31:20.669 --> 00:31:23.212]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:31:23.212 --> 00:31:26.476]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:31:26.476 --> 00:31:34.086]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:31:34.406 --> 00:31:39.810]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:31:39.810 --> 00:31:42.651]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:31:42.651 --> 00:31:46.334]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:31:46.334 --> 00:31:48.755]  And I got news for you, you're everyone else.
[00:31:48.755 --> 00:31:50.256]  Invisible Empire.

[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.021]  Man, are you urinating more frequently?
[00:32:02.021 --> 00:32:03.522]  Do you wake up to urinate?
[00:32:03.522 --> 00:32:05.363]  Don't ignore your prostate health.

[00:32:53.957 --> 00:32:55.299]  I hear a voice inside your head.
[00:32:55.299 --> 00:32:56.179]  You refuse to leave.
[00:33:12.286 --> 00:33:15.869]  I'm the face that you have to face, mirrored in your stare.
[00:33:15.869 --> 00:33:20.213]  I'm what's left, I'm what's right, I'm the enemy.
[00:33:20.213 --> 00:33:27.459]  I'm the hand that'll take you down, and you to your knees.
[00:33:27.459 --> 00:33:28.300]  So who are you?
[00:33:47.485 --> 00:33:51.368]  We are back live!
[00:33:51.368 --> 00:33:57.234]  Thank you for joining us on this Monday, the third day of May, 2010.
[00:33:57.234 --> 00:33:59.116]  May Day, International Communist Day.
[00:34:01.348 --> 00:34:21.855]  Resulted in racial attacks all over the United States, burning buildings, illegals running around with torches, knocking out windows, setting fire, and you've got to really comb the news to find it in Arizona, and New Mexico, and California, and Texas, and Florida, and New York State.
[00:34:23.018 --> 00:34:26.861]  You have got to really look to find it.
[00:34:26.861 --> 00:34:39.069]  Can you imagine, out of thousands of Tea Party rallies, if they could find one N-word, one punch, one form of violence, they would act like it was the end of the world on the news.
[00:34:39.069 --> 00:34:43.973]  They would hype it up so much that they'd just say, we have to ban America.
[00:34:43.973 --> 00:34:45.534]  You know, somebody said the N-word.
[00:34:45.534 --> 00:34:48.476]  And of course they were caught, the black Congressional Congress,
[00:34:48.956 --> 00:34:51.978]  Caucus and Congress lying and saying they were spit on.
[00:34:51.978 --> 00:34:53.639]  Kostet called the N-word.
[00:34:53.639 --> 00:34:55.820]  All the video angles total lies.
[00:34:55.820 --> 00:35:00.723]  They marched out in the Tea Party for a provocation and didn't get what they wanted.
[00:35:00.723 --> 00:35:04.826]  Their race-based politics of divide and conquer.
[00:35:04.826 --> 00:35:05.906]  That's the issue.
[00:35:05.906 --> 00:35:08.008]  They've brought in the 30 million illegals.
[00:35:08.008 --> 00:35:15.973]  The government and the media and the universities and the public schools have filled the people full of racial identity and hatred of America.
[00:35:15.973 --> 00:35:17.394]  While the rest of America
[00:35:18.254 --> 00:35:27.216]  American citizens have been taught to sit down and shut up and show no nationalism unless it's supporting bombing some third world country.
[00:35:27.216 --> 00:35:29.696]  This is globalization.
[00:35:29.696 --> 00:35:31.656]  And that's why we've got to deport the illegals.
[00:35:31.656 --> 00:35:33.997]  That's why we've got to clamp down the borders.
[00:35:33.997 --> 00:35:40.338]  Not to mention the fact that they're bankrupting the criminal justice system and the social welfare net and the hospitals.
[00:35:40.338 --> 00:35:41.378]  Look at what's happening.
[00:35:41.378 --> 00:35:43.098]  We're going bankrupt.
[00:35:43.098 --> 00:35:47.319]  They're going to announce, just like Greece, that they've got to take your pension funds.
[00:35:49.295 --> 00:35:51.037]  What was in the news yesterday?
[00:35:51.037 --> 00:35:54.099]  What did I cover on the Sunday show?
[00:35:54.099 --> 00:35:57.742]  Oh, that Greece is angry!
[00:35:57.742 --> 00:36:00.965]  The people of Greece are angry!
[00:36:00.965 --> 00:36:07.651]  They've been told that they're going to have to give up at least half of their pension fund money.
[00:36:07.651 --> 00:36:09.433]  That was in the Times of London.
[00:36:09.433 --> 00:36:12.555]  And then driving into the studio yesterday, I was listening to CNN on XM,
[00:36:14.708 --> 00:36:21.544]  And they had different pundits on going, yes, the Greek people are lazy and bad, basically.
[00:36:22.806 --> 00:36:49.154]  And the Germans are angry about the fact that they pay into their national pension and they only get 45% back of their regular salary and the people in Greece on average get above 80% and they're going to have to give up all or part of their pensions to fix the economic situation in Greece and they're very angry and they're rioting and it's wrong and they're bad.
[00:36:54.195 --> 00:36:56.096]  That's the system.
[00:36:56.096 --> 00:36:57.717]  That's what we have to look forward to.
[00:36:57.717 --> 00:37:05.281]  This is being announced that they're going to take part, or in some cases, all of our pension funds.
[00:37:05.281 --> 00:37:11.644]  See, they take all your money, city, county, local.
[00:37:11.644 --> 00:37:18.248]  They have the private pensions, the public pensions, all of them, invest in derivatives.
[00:37:18.248 --> 00:37:21.870]  Goldman Sachs and others come along and say, I've got a deal for you.
[00:37:23.257 --> 00:37:32.301]  And then not only once the Ponzi scheme goes under, you don't just pay the bankers who made money on the way up and now on the way down the bailout money.
[00:37:32.301 --> 00:37:46.128]  Then they announce, oh, we've got to keep growing government, and so we're going to have to raise value-added taxes, financial taxes, carbon taxes, and we've got to have the government take control of your pension fund and give money to the bankers.
[00:37:46.128 --> 00:37:49.049]  And because people don't understand economics or what's happening,
[00:37:52.042 --> 00:37:58.325]  And because the mainstream media won't explain it to them, they get away with it in nation after nation.
[00:37:58.325 --> 00:38:04.848]  And even if people riot for six months like they've done in Argentina, or Brazil in the past, it doesn't matter.
[00:38:04.848 --> 00:38:20.255]  Because the police just come out and gun you down or arrest you, and we've read the IMF World Bank, they call it the IMF Riot, is the phenomenon that they know after a few months you just stop beating on your pots and pans, and now you're homeless living on a street corner.
[00:38:23.442 --> 00:38:25.343]  That's just how this works.
[00:38:25.343 --> 00:38:28.924]  And the globalists have done this in nation after nation after nation.
[00:38:28.924 --> 00:38:35.467]  If you think you're safe from NAFTA and GATT and globalization, look what it's already done to your paycheck.
[00:38:35.467 --> 00:38:37.969]  Look what it's already done to the jobs in this country.
[00:38:37.969 --> 00:38:40.310]  Look what it's already done to our national sovereignty.
[00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:45.232]  And the solutions the globalists give us are only deeper down the rat hole.
[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:50.504]  Greece gets 146 billion rescue in EU IMF package.
[00:38:56.297 --> 00:38:59.878]  The biggest for a nation its size ever.
[00:38:59.878 --> 00:39:04.300]  146 billion dollars paid to the creditors of Greece.
[00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:05.220]  And who are they?
[00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:09.502]  Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, and a handful of other big mega banks.
[00:39:09.502 --> 00:39:12.923]  Who sold Greece the crud that's now worthless.
[00:39:12.923 --> 00:39:14.884]  They sold it to them and got money.
[00:39:14.884 --> 00:39:23.187]  And now, they're telling Greece, you've got to pay us back because you invested in this and it's gone belly up, and you're going to pay us back with your pension money.
[00:39:26.912 --> 00:39:28.473]  And then what is Forbes report?
[00:39:28.473 --> 00:39:31.035]  ECB president favors global governance.
[00:39:31.035 --> 00:39:38.100]  We covered this last week, now it's in Forbes over the weekend.
[00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:52.510]  And in the article they explain, well, Greece has got to give in to a new international framework, they've got to cut their services, and they've got to raise their taxes, and we've got to have a global government to enforce this.
[00:39:56.172 --> 00:40:02.355]  Pretty good work if you can get it if you're part of the private banking clan that rules the planet.
[00:40:02.355 --> 00:40:04.396]  Meanwhile, Obama, and I'm going to play this next hour.
[00:40:04.396 --> 00:40:05.556]  I said I'd play it yesterday, I didn't get to it.
[00:40:05.556 --> 00:40:07.697]  I will play it today.
[00:40:07.697 --> 00:40:14.140]  At least my ratings are high at the place of my birth.
[00:40:16.496 --> 00:40:22.480]  That's a quote, making a joke about the fact that he was born in Kenya, as his wife has said in speeches.
[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:26.082]  At least my ratings are high at the place of my birth.
[00:40:26.082 --> 00:40:29.624]  All of the jokes here tonight are brought to you by our friends at Goldman Sachs.
[00:40:29.624 --> 00:40:31.305]  Well, yeah, they were his biggest contributor.
[00:40:31.305 --> 00:40:32.626]  They brought him to power.
[00:40:32.626 --> 00:40:37.129]  They run every major position in the White House over finance.
[00:40:37.129 --> 00:40:40.131]  Don't worry, because they make money whether you laugh or not.
[00:40:40.131 --> 00:40:45.194]  Remember Bush saying, no WMDs here, no WMDs there, showing
[00:40:46.530 --> 00:40:55.012]  Video clips of him looking under the White House desk and under his bed at the White House for the WMDs in Iraq.
[00:40:55.012 --> 00:41:00.514]  At the time he made those jokes three years ago, over a million Iraqis had died and counting.
[00:41:00.514 --> 00:41:02.354]  Oh, no weapons of mass destruction here.
[00:41:02.354 --> 00:41:04.615]  Oh, no weapons of mass destruction there.
[00:41:04.615 --> 00:41:12.276]  This is a time with the elite at the White House press dinner to make fun of the slaves.
[00:41:12.276 --> 00:41:14.117]  And everyone laughs and it's so fun.
[00:41:16.701 --> 00:41:20.624]  And so Obama says, at least my ratings are high at the place of my birth.
[00:41:20.624 --> 00:41:21.625]  Haha, I'm from Kenya.
[00:41:21.625 --> 00:41:24.167]  You know, it's a big joke to him.
[00:41:24.167 --> 00:41:27.810]  He says, all the jokes here tonight are brought to you by our friends at Goldman Sachs.
[00:41:27.810 --> 00:41:31.673]  Don't worry, because they make money whether you laugh or not.
[00:41:31.673 --> 00:41:34.495]  See, we don't care if you think this is funny.
[00:41:34.495 --> 00:41:36.136]  We're going to rape you.
[00:41:36.136 --> 00:41:42.201]  Then he went on to say, quote, some Republicans have suggested that the health care bill contained a few secret provisions.
[00:41:42.201 --> 00:41:43.442]  This is untrue.
[00:41:43.442 --> 00:41:44.743]  There are hundreds.
[00:41:46.684 --> 00:41:48.726]  And there are hundreds of provisions.
[00:41:48.726 --> 00:41:50.747]  They're not secret, you just gotta know how to go check the U.S.
[00:41:50.747 --> 00:41:52.709]  Code, but they are secret to the public.
[00:41:52.709 --> 00:41:55.351]  So see, it's all a big joke on the public.
[00:41:55.351 --> 00:41:57.853]  It's all so funny.
[00:41:57.853 --> 00:41:59.794]  I thought I'd go over some of the secret provisions.
[00:41:59.794 --> 00:42:09.922]  They're not secret, but they're buried in the so-called banking reform bill that Goldman Sachs is promoting.
[00:42:09.922 --> 00:42:16.227]  Oh yes, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase and Citibank and Bank of America and Wells Fargo, they're the big boys.
[00:42:17.964 --> 00:42:20.766]  They're telling you this is a good idea.
[00:42:20.766 --> 00:42:27.390]  Gee, after months of saying, oh my gosh, you know, well, the media lies for him and says, ooh, this will get the big banks.
[00:42:27.390 --> 00:42:28.631]  Ooh, they don't want it.
[00:42:28.631 --> 00:42:31.873]  Meanwhile, the bankers are like, actually, we are for it.
[00:42:31.873 --> 00:42:33.354]  We're sorry for what we've done.
[00:42:33.354 --> 00:42:34.895]  We're ready to take our punishment.
[00:42:34.895 --> 00:42:36.276]  Go ahead and pass it.
[00:42:36.276 --> 00:42:36.957]  And what does it do?
[00:42:36.957 --> 00:42:39.338]  Gives them total power over the entire economy.
[00:42:39.338 --> 00:42:42.220]  We're going to go through this coming up in the next hour as well.
[00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:47.544]  We're going to break down what this monstrosity
[00:42:49.662 --> 00:42:53.924]  Really does.
[00:42:53.924 --> 00:42:55.545]  But I want to open the phones up.
[00:42:55.545 --> 00:42:57.826]  I want to ask the listeners.
[00:42:57.826 --> 00:43:06.009]  You can call in on any of these topics I'm about to name, but please on these topics.
[00:43:06.009 --> 00:43:15.053]  Who do you think's behind the New York failed car bomb, truck bomb?
[00:43:15.053 --> 00:43:16.314]  Are they going to blame it on the Tea Party?
[00:43:17.133 --> 00:43:18.655]  Was it a government op?
[00:43:18.655 --> 00:43:31.047]  We know they tried to blame it on the Arabs with no proof and one of the Israeli groups that's always caught uploading fake Al-Qaeda videos are the ones that uploaded and reported on within minutes that the Taliban had done it.
[00:43:31.047 --> 00:43:34.131]  And now all the government pooh-bahs
[00:43:35.950 --> 00:43:46.301]  New York Congressman, New York Governor, New York Mayor, Bloomberg, the Commissioner, the Police Commissioner, the Police Chief were all saying, no, no, no, this is not Al-Qaeda.
[00:43:46.301 --> 00:43:52.807]  They were saying that just 12 hours after the aborted failed dud attack.
[00:43:52.807 --> 00:43:59.254]  Before the video got released out of a shop showing a balding white male change his shirt
[00:44:02.045 --> 00:44:07.948]  Right in front of the car and then look sneakily over his shoulder at the vehicle.
[00:44:07.948 --> 00:44:14.091]  Was that a government operative who walked along later and staged that in front of the car?
[00:44:14.091 --> 00:44:14.392]  I don't know.
[00:44:14.392 --> 00:44:17.693]  The government's been caught engaged in this type of hanky-panky so many times.
[00:44:17.693 --> 00:44:18.614]  I don't know.
[00:44:18.614 --> 00:44:19.775]  We will find out.
[00:44:19.775 --> 00:44:21.435]  But it was on May Day.
[00:44:21.435 --> 00:44:24.257]  Is it a staged May Day event?
[00:44:24.257 --> 00:44:25.998]  Or is it real?
[00:44:25.998 --> 00:44:28.699]  I mean, the bomb was a joke.
[00:44:28.699 --> 00:44:29.600]  It was clownish.
[00:44:31.368 --> 00:44:36.112]  Are they going to move to make you get a license to buy gasoline or propane?
[00:44:36.112 --> 00:44:37.794]  They're now calling for that.
[00:44:37.794 --> 00:44:43.658]  The media were there jumping up and down like trained seals during the press conferences calling for it.
[00:44:43.658 --> 00:44:44.980]  Where is that going?
[00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:53.827]  Are you concerned about illegal aliens rioting and setting fires to buildings in multiple states, racially attacking people?
[00:44:53.827 --> 00:44:55.809]  Are you concerned about the media cover-up?
[00:44:57.165 --> 00:45:00.248]  I want to open the phones up on these issues.
[00:45:00.248 --> 00:45:07.014]  Are you concerned about the banking legislation?
[00:45:07.014 --> 00:45:13.400]  Have you seen the Orwellian Big Brother tax collection commercial that's airing in Pennsylvania?
[00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:15.362]  We're going to play that in the next hour.
[00:45:15.362 --> 00:45:16.323]  Have you seen it?
[00:45:16.323 --> 00:45:19.526]  It's up on InfoWards.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:45:21.778 --> 00:45:25.461]  Orwellian Big Brother Tax Collection commercial airs in Pennsylvania.
[00:45:25.461 --> 00:45:29.164]  It's in the news tiles up at InfoWars.com up there at the top.
[00:45:29.164 --> 00:45:31.406]  Scroll through, you can watch it.
[00:45:31.406 --> 00:45:32.567]  What is your take on this?
[00:45:32.567 --> 00:45:32.708]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:45:32.708 --> 00:45:32.808]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:45:32.808 --> 00:45:33.448]  The Federal Reserve has
[00:45:45.441 --> 00:45:45.601]  Yes.
[00:46:03.177 --> 00:46:16.358]  And $46 billion, and of course just like they said a year and a half ago that it was $887 billion, and it turned out it was $28 plus trillion and counting, this is an open rotating window where they can come in every week and get their $700 billion plus.
[00:46:18.558 --> 00:46:20.198]  And that's only one way they get the money.
[00:46:20.198 --> 00:46:22.559]  And remember, they won't tell Congress where it goes.
[00:46:22.559 --> 00:46:24.700]  And they won't tell the European Union where it goes.
[00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:29.281]  Because this is a global government set up for and by bankers.
[00:46:29.281 --> 00:46:34.123]  We have the head of the European Central Bank saying, new world order, global government, global governance.
[00:46:35.123 --> 00:46:39.826]  Gordon Brown, the British Prime Minister, saying this is a world government run by the bankers.
[00:46:39.826 --> 00:46:46.610]  We have David Rockefeller saying a new world order, a world government for the administrative convenience of central bankers.
[00:46:46.610 --> 00:46:48.611]  That's what we face.
[00:46:48.611 --> 00:46:52.734]  And the central bankers will use illegal alien hordes as political weapons.
[00:46:52.734 --> 00:46:56.836]  They will use staged terrorism as a political weapon to beat you into submission.
[00:46:56.836 --> 00:47:01.039]  They will use boogeyman, end of the world, Armageddon hype.
[00:47:01.579 --> 00:47:09.806]  Psychological terrorism saying the oceans will rise and flood every coastal city and that we'll all basically die if you don't pay them carbon taxes.
[00:47:09.806 --> 00:47:21.495]  They are terrorists by any yardstick, by any measurable indicator.
[00:47:21.495 --> 00:47:25.698]  Period!
[00:47:25.698 --> 00:47:27.620]  And they're not going to stop.
[00:47:28.669 --> 00:47:42.556]  And I have come out and addressed the real problem, the fractional reserve banking system, where private banking families in the last 200 years have taken over Europe and England and in the United States 97 years ago.
[00:47:42.556 --> 00:47:54.702]  And with that power of the issuance of currency and credit, they have taken over almost the entire world, and now they are criminally out in the open, mopping up what's left of free societies.
[00:47:54.702 --> 00:47:56.463]  And they are not going to give us any quarter.
[00:47:58.103 --> 00:48:01.325]  Government scum who love the system.
[00:48:01.325 --> 00:48:03.245]  People in the government who support what's happening.
[00:48:03.245 --> 00:48:05.266]  A lot of people don't, who are in the government.
[00:48:05.266 --> 00:48:07.247]  But people in the government who like what's happening.
[00:48:07.247 --> 00:48:10.089]  Your children are going to not have as good a way of life.
[00:48:10.089 --> 00:48:12.029]  And they're not going to have freedom.
[00:48:12.029 --> 00:48:15.051]  And no future.
[00:48:15.051 --> 00:48:21.794]  You are going to end up, most of you listening that serve this, you're going to end up cheating yourselves.
[00:48:21.794 --> 00:48:23.555]  You're going to end up hurting yourselves.
[00:48:24.551 --> 00:48:26.033]  This does not have to happen.
[00:48:26.033 --> 00:48:28.795]  We do not have to go down this road.
[00:48:28.795 --> 00:48:31.198]  Please, look twice.
[00:48:31.198 --> 00:48:31.958]  Look three times.
[00:48:31.958 --> 00:48:32.719]  Look four times.
[00:48:32.719 --> 00:48:34.701]  Please, listen to what I'm saying.
[00:48:34.701 --> 00:48:38.485]  Please, research what we're talking about here.
[00:48:38.485 --> 00:48:41.928]  They're using fake environmentalism, staged terrorism.
[00:48:43.175 --> 00:49:02.240]  And economic warfare as well as illegal alien hordes, whether it's Australia, whether it's England, whether it's the continent of Europe, whether it's the United States or Canada, to menace, to menace and to have a political weapon against free societies.
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:07.062]  We're going to go to break and come back with Guy, Annie, John, Ross and others into the next hour.
[00:49:07.062 --> 00:49:10.963]  And then I'm going to go back through all of this and a lot more in great detail today.
[00:49:15.250 --> 00:49:35.083]  But I've been telling you the last several years, I've been telling you intensely the last four months, that we were going to go into illegal alien riots, we were going to go into staged terror attacks to be blamed on the Tea Parties, that you would see open demonization and an invoking of Oklahoma City to claim that a second Oklahoma City was coming and that it would be blamed on
[00:49:36.516 --> 00:49:39.658]  Constitutionalist and now you see it all manifesting.
[00:49:39.658 --> 00:49:41.819]  We know their game plan.
[00:49:41.819 --> 00:49:57.826]  We understand exactly what they're going to do and it is life and death for this country and life and death for our freedom that this information be transmitted to everyone now.
[00:49:57.826 --> 00:49:59.347]  Before I go to break I want to
[00:50:00.976 --> 00:50:06.742]  Encourage listeners to also support this radio slash TV slash news website operation.

[00:50:24.819 --> 00:50:32.603]  And the power of you getting them and making copies and airing them on AXS TV and giving them to everyone you know is unbelievably powerful.

[00:51:00.643 --> 00:51:09.871]  Global meltdowns, massive unemployment, endless wars, a new currency crisis, financially and morally bankrupt, a great and terrible storm is approaching.

[00:52:10.221 --> 00:52:12.663]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:52:12.663 --> 00:52:18.028]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:52:19.616 --> 00:52:20.236]  We're good to go.
[00:52:42.851 --> 00:52:45.573]  Stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:52:45.573 --> 00:52:49.115]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.

[00:52:51.096 --> 00:52:52.216]  It's here.

[00:54:14.773 --> 00:54:20.476]  Remember a week and a half ago the head of the IMF said the good times are over for rich nations?
[00:54:20.476 --> 00:54:22.317]  You're gonna be poor now.
[00:54:22.317 --> 00:54:23.898]  Everything goes to the bankers.
[00:54:23.898 --> 00:54:38.545]  140 plus billion dollars of US, British and other European taxpayer money going to JP Morgan, Chase, Goldman Sachs and others.
[00:54:39.884 --> 00:54:51.716]  As the head of the European Central Bank brags and says our world government is here, and as record bonuses and just billions and billions of dollars flood into their individual hands.
[00:54:51.716 --> 00:55:04.408]  And they're just going to go, country by country, just looting them out, and saying your taxes go up and your roads don't get fixed, and we the bankers live in armored citadels in Switzerland, and Portugal, and London.
[00:55:06.940 --> 00:55:09.080]  They don't want a good economy.
[00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:10.901]  They don't want to make money with you.
[00:55:10.901 --> 00:55:12.521]  They don't want you to do well.
[00:55:12.521 --> 00:55:13.781]  They print the money.
[00:55:13.781 --> 00:55:16.562]  They're waging war against the real economy.
[00:55:16.562 --> 00:55:19.402]  They hate private property that isn't in their hands.
[00:55:19.402 --> 00:55:20.803]  All right, I'm going to shut up.
[00:55:20.803 --> 00:55:26.724]  I'm just getting so angry watching their operation unfold.
[00:55:26.724 --> 00:55:28.684]  And I've got to step up and go after the real enemy.
[00:55:28.684 --> 00:55:33.965]  That's why I've got national news and all these police organizations lying about me, saying I'm calling for violence.
[00:55:35.711 --> 00:55:42.357]  You notice they attack Tea Partiers when they're peaceful, but you notice the illegal aliens can burn down buildings and attack people and nothing's done.
[00:55:42.357 --> 00:55:46.920]  It's not even in the national news because they're allied with the bankers.
[00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:50.003]  Most of them are too ignorant to know it, just like the general public.
[00:55:50.003 --> 00:55:52.605]  But I know who they're allied with, I understand.
[00:55:52.605 --> 00:55:54.727]  Anything the globalists are for, I'm against it.
[00:55:54.727 --> 00:55:57.069]  Guy in Jersey, you're on the air, thanks for holding.
[00:55:58.004 --> 00:56:05.488]  Hey Alex, I wanted to switch the subject to internet privacy for a minute here.
[00:56:05.488 --> 00:56:06.868]  Let me ask you a question, Guy.
[00:56:06.868 --> 00:56:09.389]  You know, sometimes I say first-time callers.
[00:56:09.389 --> 00:56:13.972]  Most of the time, about 80% of the time, I just say totally wide open phones.
[00:56:13.972 --> 00:56:15.812]  And then today I threw out three or four topics.
[00:56:15.812 --> 00:56:21.255]  I said I really wanted to get people's take on this stuff.
[00:56:21.255 --> 00:56:25.137]  Then I'll go back to the New York bombing.
[00:56:26.546 --> 00:56:41.329]  Um, I personally think that it must be some type of staged event that they're going to, obviously, blame this on some type of right-wing group and say, you know, maybe he was a neo-Nazi, who knows, you know?
[00:56:41.329 --> 00:56:45.830]  It's crazy, when I was hearing about it on the news.
[00:56:45.830 --> 00:56:51.871]  And there was a lot of misleading information at first, and now they're starting to, I guess, uncover the truth.
[00:56:54.680 --> 00:57:01.041]  It's ridiculous that you're going to see soon enough that they're going to blame this on right-wing groups.
[00:57:01.041 --> 00:57:04.822]  And Obama's going to have a feeding frenzy off of this, if you ask me.
[00:57:04.822 --> 00:57:06.402]  Well, I hope you're wrong, Guy.
[00:57:06.402 --> 00:57:09.703]  Now, go ahead and make your point about internet privacy.
[00:57:09.703 --> 00:57:12.483]  It's going down the toilet with Facebook and Google.
[00:57:12.483 --> 00:57:13.363]  Oh, exactly.
[00:57:13.363 --> 00:57:14.864]  That's what I was going to bring up.
[00:57:14.864 --> 00:57:19.064]  I myself, like most people, like to listen to music on the internet.
[00:57:19.064 --> 00:57:20.965]  So, on Pandora.com.
[00:57:20.965 --> 00:57:21.945]  So, I was on there.
[00:57:22.518 --> 00:57:22.919]  I don't know.
[00:57:44.322 --> 00:57:45.823]  And you can opt out of it.
[00:57:45.823 --> 00:57:48.425]  People can do their own research and Google it and find out what I'm talking about.
[00:57:48.425 --> 00:57:57.111]  But they make it very hard and hidden, just like New York's trying to pass a law where they automatically take your organs and then don't even tell you to opt out.
[00:57:57.111 --> 00:57:58.152]  You've got to know about it.
[00:57:58.152 --> 00:58:05.597]  But instead, all you know about is, you know, American Idol or how to act stylish or how to drink fluoride water, how to become sterile and die of cancer.
[00:58:05.597 --> 00:58:07.979]  The average person is just enjoying being poisoned.
[00:58:07.979 --> 00:58:11.862]  And so they don't even, you know, they just wander in mindlessly and aren't even aware of it.
[00:58:12.771 --> 00:58:13.811]  Exactly.
[00:58:13.811 --> 00:58:21.935]  And on the subject of being poisoned and whatnot, I myself just started going to my local health food store and buying, you know, more healthy products.
[00:58:21.935 --> 00:58:29.658]  But then another question, you know, do you, um, I know Poland Springs supposedly does not fluoridate their water, but could you answer that?
[00:58:29.658 --> 00:58:31.579]  Poland Springs.
[00:58:31.579 --> 00:58:34.320]  I don't know specifically that brand.
[00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:37.641]  I mean, I don't, I don't know everything, so I'll have to look into it.
[00:58:37.641 --> 00:58:38.542]  I appreciate your call.
[00:58:40.940 --> 00:58:46.582]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[00:58:46.582 --> 00:58:50.444]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[00:58:50.444 --> 00:58:51.724]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:51.724 --> 00:58:57.306]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:58:57.306 --> 00:59:02.328]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:59:02.328 --> 00:59:07.370]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:59:07.910 --> 00:59:13.134]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:59:13.134 --> 00:59:15.435]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:59:15.435 --> 00:59:20.238]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:59:20.238 --> 00:59:21.359]  And here's the best part.
[00:59:21.359 --> 00:59:24.441]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:59:24.441 --> 00:59:28.064]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:59:28.064 --> 00:59:31.246]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:59:31.246 --> 00:59:33.467]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:59:33.467 --> 00:59:34.388]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:59:38.030 --> 00:59:42.252]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:59:42.252 --> 00:59:47.094]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:59:47.094 --> 00:59:53.516]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:59:53.516 --> 00:59:55.917]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.917 --> 01:00:05.221]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.221 --> 01:00:06.522]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.522 --> 01:00:07.482]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.292 --> 01:00:10.035]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.035 --> 01:00:11.637]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.637 --> 01:00:13.540]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.540 --> 01:00:17.386]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.386 --> 01:00:21.412]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.008 --> 01:00:28.309]  We're going live at PrisonPlanet.tv in T-minus seven and a half minutes.
[01:00:28.309 --> 01:00:31.649]  We're continuing with your phone calls until the bottom of the hour.
[01:00:31.649 --> 01:00:45.252]  Then I'm going to news blitz, and I mean blitz on a host of key issues, including Obama's White House press dinner, a commencement speech he gave, the banking takeover, so much that is happening right now.
[01:00:45.252 --> 01:00:46.692]  Let's go to Annie in New York.
[01:00:46.692 --> 01:00:48.172]  Annie, you're on the air.
[01:00:48.172 --> 01:00:49.372]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:00:49.372 --> 01:00:53.793]  You know, they want us to believe that Al Qaeda was so sophisticated that they thwarted the most
[01:00:54.412 --> 01:00:57.093]  Advanced Military Machine Industry on 9-11.
[01:00:57.093 --> 01:01:04.116]  At the same time, they want us to believe that Brzezinski's bombers are responsible for this, you know, tinker toy in Times Square.
[01:01:04.116 --> 01:01:06.557]  I think it was definitely a government op.
[01:01:06.557 --> 01:01:10.478]  I think it was designed as a one-size-fits-all terror event.
[01:01:10.478 --> 01:01:19.402]  And I think, you know, for many reasons, not least of which is the Reverend Manning, Pastor Manning's, march around Columbia University and the trial that's coming up.
[01:01:20.219 --> 01:01:21.720]  You know, that's a good point.
[01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:26.823]  We had Manning on, was Manning on Thursday or Friday of last week?
[01:01:26.823 --> 01:01:39.151]  We had Manning on and he said, I'm worried about a staged terror attack in the next week to try to stop us from having our march to expose that Obama's CIA and not a citizen.
[01:01:39.151 --> 01:01:42.153]  And he does have a lot of pull in Harlem.
[01:01:42.153 --> 01:01:45.715]  Boy, I tell you, Manning said that last week on the show.
[01:01:47.034 --> 01:01:47.955]  And I mean, come on.
[01:01:47.955 --> 01:01:50.476]  I mean, this thing, what a tinker toy.
[01:01:50.476 --> 01:01:55.480]  You know, from the sophistication of what was involved in 9-11 to this, it's just so pathetic.
[01:01:55.480 --> 01:02:15.514]  Alex, one other thing I wanted to say, um, this past Saturday, May Day, recently a choir GE NBC propaganda on the Weather Channel was playing Mexican music as the music that during every other local on the 8th, and I first tuned in just after 8 o'clock, I was so infuriated that the same Mexican instrumental was playing repeatedly
[01:02:16.078 --> 01:02:18.240]  I kept checking back and checking back for more than an hour.
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:30.488]  I just couldn't take it anymore, but I would urge everyone to boycott the Weather Channel as they're just another mainstream media tool, and evidently they're moving on from their fraudulent global warming propaganda.
[01:02:30.488 --> 01:02:32.189]  Now they're espousing illegal immigration.
[01:02:32.189 --> 01:02:33.930]  Take care, Alex.
[01:02:33.930 --> 01:02:35.351]  I appreciate your call.
[01:02:35.351 --> 01:02:36.492]  Great points.
[01:02:36.492 --> 01:02:45.138]  Listen, when I went to college 17, 18 years ago, it didn't matter what class it was.
[01:02:46.468 --> 01:02:47.128]  It didn't matter.
[01:02:47.128 --> 01:02:51.811]  I mean, it wasn't just psychology and Texas history and U.S.
[01:02:51.811 --> 01:02:54.092]  history that was a bunch of brainwashing.
[01:02:54.092 --> 01:02:55.632]  It was anthropology.
[01:02:55.632 --> 01:02:56.873]  It was archaeology.
[01:02:56.873 --> 01:02:58.374]  It was math.
[01:02:58.374 --> 01:03:06.778]  And they would just get up at the start of the class and say, the Second Amendment's bad, white people are basically bad, world government's good, turn your guns in.
[01:03:06.778 --> 01:03:11.620]  I mean, it was just in-your-face communism, funded by big banks.
[01:03:11.620 --> 01:03:15.162]  Because big banks want us all poor, and they're the only people with any money.
[01:03:16.283 --> 01:03:19.451]  It is very, very simple.
[01:03:19.451 --> 01:03:19.752]  You know what?
[01:03:19.752 --> 01:03:22.358]  I'm going to go to PrisonPlanet.tv right now myself.
[01:03:24.344 --> 01:03:30.367]  And I'm gonna go see PrisonPlanet.TV, that'll say what days people were on.
[01:03:30.367 --> 01:03:35.169]  And Manning was on Wednesday.
[01:03:35.169 --> 01:03:38.770]  Wednesday he was on, man time flies, that just feels like it was Friday.
[01:03:38.770 --> 01:03:45.033]  And he said, yes, I'm very concerned they'll stage some type of event in the next week or two before our big march in New York.
[01:03:45.033 --> 01:03:48.234]  Now that could just be coincidental, but that is very, very strange.
[01:03:48.234 --> 01:03:49.555]  And he has been visited by the FBI.
[01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:53.982]  Homeland Security and the CIA.
[01:03:53.982 --> 01:03:58.704]  We got Greg Palast coming up in the next hour for just 30 minutes.
[01:03:58.704 --> 01:04:00.445]  Of course, we have James Travacon on Friday.
[01:04:00.445 --> 01:04:03.266]  We've got some other really big guests coming up throughout the week.
[01:04:03.266 --> 01:04:05.307]  They're gonna be extremely informative.
[01:04:05.307 --> 01:04:08.509]  When we come back from this quick break, we've got a long segment coming up.
[01:04:08.509 --> 01:04:12.391]  We're gonna go to John, Ross, Ryan, Paul, Lex, and others.
[01:04:12.391 --> 01:04:14.332]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:04:18.874 --> 01:04:20.294]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:04:20.294 --> 01:04:38.818]  But I do want to get into some more information dealing with the illegal aliens rioting and burning things down in the last three days around the United States and the almost complete mainstream media blackout on this when we return and then right back to your phone calls.
[01:04:38.818 --> 01:04:43.079]  And then Greece gets 146 billion rescue in EU IMF package.
[01:04:43.079 --> 01:04:44.239]  It's not a rescue.
[01:04:44.239 --> 01:04:48.440]  All that money goes to the banks that sold them the fraudulent derivatives.
[01:04:50.458 --> 01:04:53.662]  And I've got the head of the IMF saying, hey, the good times are over.
[01:04:53.662 --> 01:04:55.544]  Your freedom is gone, America.
[01:04:55.544 --> 01:04:57.586]  How about we just arrest these people?
[01:04:57.586 --> 01:04:58.067]  How about that?
[01:05:02.247 --> 01:05:06.208]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:06.208 --> 01:05:15.069]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:05:15.069 --> 01:05:19.710]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:05:19.710 --> 01:05:30.512]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:05:31.152 --> 01:05:40.675]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:40.675 --> 01:05:46.097]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:05:46.097 --> 01:05:53.580]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:56.341]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:06:04.375 --> 01:06:05.636]  Tyranny is here.
[01:06:05.636 --> 01:06:09.377]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:06:09.377 --> 01:06:11.798]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:06:11.798 --> 01:06:17.681]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:06:17.681 --> 01:06:23.924]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:06:24.344 --> 01:06:30.287]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:06:30.287 --> 01:06:34.488]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:06:34.488 --> 01:06:38.790]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:06:38.790 --> 01:06:44.732]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:06:44.732 --> 01:06:48.294]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:06:48.294 --> 01:06:50.255]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:06:50.255 --> 01:06:50.695]  It's here.

[01:07:00.947 --> 01:07:08.213]  People know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[01:07:08.213 --> 01:07:12.716]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[01:07:12.716 --> 01:07:17.860]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals.
[01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:23.765]  Using Plasma pH Drops is the best way to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and
[01:07:25.316 --> 01:07:30.001]  Simply put 10 drops in the water you drink to raise the pH to a healthy level.
[01:07:30.001 --> 01:07:36.028]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[01:07:36.028 --> 01:07:42.556]  Disease organisms like bacteria, viruses and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment.

[01:08:10.422 --> 01:08:12.003]  You want answers?
[01:08:12.003 --> 01:08:13.543]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.543 --> 01:08:17.745]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.745 --> 01:08:20.086]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[01:08:21.046 --> 01:08:24.527]  We're live, eight minutes into the second hour.
[01:08:24.527 --> 01:08:29.169]  Thank you for joining us on this Monday, May 3rd, 2010 edition.
[01:08:29.169 --> 01:08:39.593]  We've seen the Communist International Workers' Day riots, buildings being torched, people being racially attacked all over the United States, and an almost complete mainstream media blackout.
[01:08:39.593 --> 01:08:42.134]  It is in the AP, Associated Press.
[01:08:42.134 --> 01:08:45.115]  It is in some local newspapers in California, Arizona.
[01:08:46.041 --> 01:08:46.261]  I don't
[01:09:11.699 --> 01:09:12.220]  We're good to go.
[01:09:38.781 --> 01:09:45.524]  He says, give us free health care, jobs, no taxes, house, food.
[01:09:45.524 --> 01:09:47.365]  Wow!
[01:09:47.365 --> 01:09:48.166]  You're not going to work?
[01:09:48.166 --> 01:09:49.286]  You're not going to pay taxes?
[01:09:49.286 --> 01:09:54.789]  He says, give us free health care, jobs, no taxes, house, food.
[01:09:54.789 --> 01:09:56.950]  You owe us America.
[01:09:56.950 --> 01:10:01.392]  We will shoot more police in Arizona until we get free.
[01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:06.403]  And they're having cops all the time being killed in Arizona.
[01:10:06.403 --> 01:10:11.629]  That's why they've, every week or two, illegals kill another cop and they burn down houses all over Arizona.
[01:10:11.629 --> 01:10:16.354]  One night, a few years ago, 14 homes were burned in one night.
[01:10:16.354 --> 01:10:17.516]  Cattle are being shot.
[01:10:17.516 --> 01:10:18.236]  I mean, it is just...
[01:10:19.471 --> 01:10:20.451]  Total implosion.
[01:10:20.451 --> 01:10:22.612]  Mexico has collapsed.
[01:10:22.612 --> 01:10:24.133]  There is hardly anywhere that isn't safe.
[01:10:24.133 --> 01:10:27.394]  20 plus thousand deaths the last two years alone.
[01:10:27.394 --> 01:10:29.795]  Spilling across the border.
[01:10:29.795 --> 01:10:33.197]  And illegal aliens just running around waving signs.
[01:10:33.197 --> 01:10:38.459]  Countless clips where the illegal aliens are saying that
[01:10:39.673 --> 01:10:41.655]  They want basically everything free.
[01:10:41.655 --> 01:10:53.144]  Let's go ahead and play this clip of the woman again right before they attack police at that rally in Arizona saying we will use our axes, our pickaxes, to kill you.
[01:10:53.144 --> 01:10:53.545]  Here it is.
[01:10:56.186 --> 01:10:57.207]  Oh, ma'am.
[01:10:57.207 --> 01:10:59.028]  I mean, we do believe you.
[01:10:59.028 --> 01:11:02.590]  I mean, I've got Albuquerque banks hit with brazen vandals.
[01:11:02.590 --> 01:11:06.512]  Where is my... I can't even keep track of this anymore.
[01:11:06.512 --> 01:11:07.232]  Where is my...
[01:11:25.708 --> 01:11:33.112]  Where is my stack about the illegal aliens attacking Santa Cruz and San Francisco?
[01:11:33.112 --> 01:11:39.195]  I mean, I can't even keep track of it here.
[01:11:39.195 --> 01:11:43.397]  Meanwhile, if you send human rights observers down to Mexico, you get machine gunned.
[01:11:43.397 --> 01:11:47.719]  Here's the Washington Post.
[01:11:47.719 --> 01:11:50.681]  Here's ABC News.
[01:11:50.681 --> 01:11:55.243]  What I'll do is I'm going to go to your calls and I'm going to dig around in my stack and see
[01:11:57.671 --> 01:11:59.833]  You're bringing me so many articles in so fast here.
[01:11:59.833 --> 01:12:07.660]  I'm going to find those three articles I had from the AP and others about the torches and the burning buildings.
[01:12:07.660 --> 01:12:08.060]  You know what?
[01:12:08.060 --> 01:12:09.522]  I ammed you three of those this morning.
[01:12:09.522 --> 01:12:10.883]  Just reprint them again.
[01:12:10.883 --> 01:12:12.044]  I've got to clean the desk off.
[01:12:12.044 --> 01:12:21.472]  This is only three days of broadcast here and it's become a complete mess because of, well, the fact that I don't file this stuff.
[01:12:21.472 --> 01:12:22.834]  There's just too much to even keep track of.
[01:12:24.571 --> 01:12:26.072]  I'll get into this at the bottom of the hour.
[01:12:26.072 --> 01:12:28.432]  I'll just get into it at the bottom of the hour.
[01:12:28.432 --> 01:12:29.833]  Let's talk to John in Minnesota.
[01:12:29.833 --> 01:12:32.474]  You're on the air, John.
[01:12:32.474 --> 01:12:33.834]  Yes, Alex.
[01:12:33.834 --> 01:12:40.717]  Do you believe Goldman Sachs is a reincarnation of Don Pacifico?
[01:12:40.717 --> 01:12:43.638]  We'll tell folks who Don Pacifico is.
[01:12:43.638 --> 01:12:52.741]  Well, Don Pacifico was a Portuguese Jewish guy who had lived in Gibraltar and acquired English or British citizenship.
[01:12:53.343 --> 01:12:58.605]  And, uh, he had moved to Athens, Greece, and he set up a good shy-locking operation.
[01:12:58.605 --> 01:13:04.987]  And, uh, anyways, the Greeks got very mad, and they burned down his house, and they took his money, etc.
[01:13:04.987 --> 01:13:11.489]  And this guy, he's suing the Greek government, as an individual now, for millions of pounds sterling.
[01:13:11.489 --> 01:13:13.529]  So who, who intervenes?
[01:13:13.529 --> 01:13:14.870]  Oh, not the Krauts.
[01:13:14.870 --> 01:13:16.490]  It's Lord Palmerston.
[01:13:16.490 --> 01:13:18.011]  It's the House of Lords.
[01:13:18.011 --> 01:13:21.692]  They happened to send 14 ships on, uh, January 18th,
[01:13:23.217 --> 01:13:27.739]  1850 to blockade until Greece paid up.
[01:13:27.739 --> 01:13:30.220]  I was not aware of that story.
[01:13:30.220 --> 01:13:36.303]  The name rung a slight bell in the back of my mind, but you'll have to send me an email about that.
[01:13:36.303 --> 01:13:37.963]  I appreciate your call.
[01:13:37.963 --> 01:13:41.425]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ross in Texas.
[01:13:41.425 --> 01:13:43.145]  Ross, you're on the air.
[01:13:43.145 --> 01:13:43.725]  Alex?
[01:13:43.725 --> 01:13:44.906]  Yes, sir.
[01:13:44.906 --> 01:13:46.847]  Sir, it's an honor to speak with you.
[01:13:46.847 --> 01:13:49.788]  You're one of my heroes.
[01:13:49.788 --> 01:13:52.289]  Just like a voice in the wilderness crying out to the world,
[01:13:52.932 --> 01:13:57.834]  You know, when you think of heroes, you think of people like, what, Bush landing on an aircraft carrier or a chain or something like that.
[01:13:57.834 --> 01:14:02.595]  And those are, we need people who speak the truth and you are, you're my hero.
[01:14:02.595 --> 01:14:07.097]  And you might call this because I want to address the illegal alien situation.
[01:14:07.097 --> 01:14:12.318]  I believe people, we have to understand that these are all people.
[01:14:12.318 --> 01:14:14.519]  We're all part of God's creation.
[01:14:14.519 --> 01:14:15.299]  They're people.
[01:14:15.299 --> 01:14:17.960]  They're here because there's a reason for it.
[01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:20.761]  And if we allow the people who are in power
[01:14:21.570 --> 01:14:27.234]  to manipulate us by fighting with each other then they don't have to fight, they don't have to fire a shot.
[01:14:27.234 --> 01:14:34.540]  Second, when we talk about the money that's been given to the bankers, they won't tell us where it's been distributed.
[01:14:34.540 --> 01:14:36.101]  It's been given to the mercenaries.
[01:14:36.101 --> 01:14:42.326]  They're already in play, they're already been paid, and they're going to get more money when they start pulling the triggers.
[01:14:42.326 --> 01:14:48.091]  Third, really, really, people, we really need to be able to have our own water supply.
[01:14:48.502 --> 01:14:50.583]  We have to reclaim our water supplies.
[01:14:50.583 --> 01:15:02.167]  Now, the same fluoride injection systems will be used to... Alex, do you remember several years ago in London, when all those people got sick from the Neurovirus?
[01:15:02.167 --> 01:15:07.269]  In two weeks time, 2.2 million people, I believe, were sickened.
[01:15:07.269 --> 01:15:08.049]  Think about that.
[01:15:08.049 --> 01:15:10.070]  That was a beta test.
[01:15:10.070 --> 01:15:15.992]  Anyway, in closing, sir, I just think that... I think the world of you, and I just thank Jesus that
[01:15:16.502 --> 01:15:19.884]  He's given us a voice to hear what's really going on.
[01:15:19.884 --> 01:15:20.585]  Thank you, sir.
[01:15:20.585 --> 01:15:24.107]  Well, Ross in Texas, I appreciate your call.
[01:15:24.107 --> 01:15:25.548]  We have to be specific, though.
[01:15:25.548 --> 01:15:32.933]  Notice how the media is demonizing Tea Parties, conservatives, libertarians, anybody who is against the banking takeover.
[01:15:32.933 --> 01:15:41.519]  And by saying that the Tea Parties were Republican in the last year and a half, the media created a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[01:15:42.543 --> 01:15:59.431]  That's what they were able to do because then Republicans, mainline Republicans, did go out and did join the Tea Parties and basically started taking it over because they were told by the media this is a Republican event when it should have been a not bipartisan but just populist movement.
[01:15:59.431 --> 01:16:00.792]  Okay?
[01:16:00.792 --> 01:16:09.316]  And so now they're trying to limit criticism of the banking takeover to something that Republicans are doing when it's only common sense.
[01:16:09.316 --> 01:16:10.877]  This is something that affects everybody.
[01:16:11.826 --> 01:16:19.892]  And on the subject of illegal aliens, most illegal aliens are just hard-working people wanting to send money home to their family.
[01:16:19.892 --> 01:16:40.689]  But, because of the media and the public schools in Mexico and the U.S., the liberation theology they've been taught is that the Southwest belongs to Mexico, Mexico is poor, not because they've always been under colonial tyranny, but because the United States is bad, and that this is their nation, and that they have a right to everything for free.
[01:16:41.900 --> 01:16:58.392]  And so a large percentage, I wouldn't say the majority, but a large minority of the illegal aliens are hardcore, just extremely hardcore radicals that can't stand this country.
[01:16:58.392 --> 01:17:06.358]  And they've been radicalized, and when they carry out radical attacks like burning buildings and racially attacking people, the media sweeps it under the rug.
[01:17:11.018 --> 01:17:14.900]  People think that the Republican Party is going to save them and stop all of this.
[01:17:14.900 --> 01:17:27.507]  It was in the Dallas Morning News in 2007 that Rob Allen & Co., this giant PR firm that Bush used when he was governor and then president, actually financed and funded the first illegal alien rallies around the country for...
[01:17:28.647 --> 01:17:29.568]  Amnesty.
[01:17:29.568 --> 01:17:30.409]  But it backfired.
[01:17:30.409 --> 01:17:34.513]  The illegals refused the American flags that Rob Allen and Co.
[01:17:34.513 --> 01:17:38.678]  and others were giving them out of the backs of trucks and waved their Mexican flags.
[01:17:38.678 --> 01:17:42.422]  And so it backfired and blew up in their face.
[01:17:42.422 --> 01:17:51.051]  And so now you have all of these business owners in Santa Cruz and other places, and we'll fast forward on this tape and show you some of that, where
[01:17:52.905 --> 01:18:01.530]  You know, people are running around attacking structures, setting fires, and then the media just basically engages in a national cover-up of this.
[01:18:01.530 --> 01:18:03.931]  This should be national news.
[01:18:03.931 --> 01:18:06.273]  Let's go to another caller here.
[01:18:06.273 --> 01:18:07.694]  Let's talk to Paul in Tennessee.
[01:18:07.694 --> 01:18:10.495]  Paul, you're on the air.
[01:18:10.495 --> 01:18:11.396]  Am I on there, Alex?
[01:18:11.396 --> 01:18:11.876]  Yes, you are.
[01:18:11.876 --> 01:18:12.736]  All right, sir.
[01:18:12.736 --> 01:18:16.338]  I just wanted to say, you are the 21st century Thomas Jefferson.
[01:18:16.338 --> 01:18:19.740]  There's nobody else doing what you're doing right now, and I do appreciate you.
[01:18:19.740 --> 01:18:21.661]  I'm the illegal alien.
[01:18:23.311 --> 01:18:24.371]  situation here.
[01:18:24.371 --> 01:18:25.751]  I just wanted to read it briefly.
[01:18:25.751 --> 01:18:29.452]  I'll abridge it a little bit out of the Daily Times in Blount County, Tennessee.
[01:18:29.452 --> 01:18:31.693]  This happened on March 27th.
[01:18:31.693 --> 01:18:33.413]  Officer seized cash, released two men.
[01:18:33.413 --> 01:18:42.175]  Monroe County authorities released two Mexican men without charges after seizing $105,000 in cash and several other items from their vehicle.
[01:18:42.175 --> 01:18:49.336]  The occupants, both Mexican nationals, explained they were on their way back to Mexico from a visit to New York City where they had stayed for three days.
[01:18:50.437 --> 01:19:01.005]  Queen said he seized a total of $104,990 in cash, along with a laptop, computer, Nikon camera, three cell phones, a GPS, and a Zoner recording device.
[01:19:01.005 --> 01:19:03.307]  He said he allowed the two to drive away without charges.
[01:19:03.307 --> 01:19:06.970]  He did give them a property receipt for the evidence seized.
[01:19:06.970 --> 01:19:12.014]  And I just wanted to think, what do you think of that?
[01:19:12.014 --> 01:19:14.055]  Give me that headline again.
[01:19:14.055 --> 01:19:16.897]  Officer seized cash, released two men.
[01:19:16.897 --> 01:19:17.798]  Monroe County News.
[01:19:20.532 --> 01:19:24.596]  I mean, I don't know until I have more info.
[01:19:24.596 --> 01:19:25.137]  Read that again.
[01:19:29.181 --> 01:19:36.786]  Monroe County authorities released two Mexican men without charges after seizing $105,000 in cash and several other items from their vehicle.
[01:19:36.786 --> 01:19:38.107]  Yeah, that's amazing.
[01:19:38.107 --> 01:19:39.148]  Well, that's what happens.
[01:19:39.148 --> 01:19:48.093]  The police, most of the time, it's come out in big cities especially, they just keep the drug money cash and just let people go, especially if they're illegal aliens.
[01:19:48.093 --> 01:19:50.035]  This is the point I make every day.
[01:19:50.035 --> 01:19:50.555]  Stay there.
[01:19:50.555 --> 01:19:56.899]  We're going to come back and try to find that article and show people that on air on the other side.
[01:19:56.899 --> 01:19:57.580]  We'll be right back.
[01:19:57.580 --> 01:19:57.960]  Stay with us.

[01:21:16.714 --> 01:21:18.835]  dollar continues its slide into oblivion.

[01:24:12.436 --> 01:24:25.282]  In fact, many of the cases I've seen have been in Tennessee, where sheriffs will arrest a van, in one case with 14 illegal aliens in it, with the coyote driving with a bunch of cash, and the feds say, keep the cash.
[01:24:25.282 --> 01:24:29.344]  It turned out it was the money that the illegals had paid thousands to be brought into the U.S.
[01:24:31.368 --> 01:24:36.512]  But let the illegal aliens go, and here's KnoxNews.com.
[01:24:36.512 --> 01:24:39.775]  We're on in Knoxville, Tennessee, WBCR.
[01:24:39.775 --> 01:24:41.416]  Great folks down there.
[01:24:41.416 --> 01:24:48.662]  Deputy sees $105,000 after Mexicans deny cash was theirs.
[01:24:48.662 --> 01:24:53.766]  And I'm glad the caller called in with this info because this just adds to what I'm talking about.
[01:24:53.766 --> 01:24:58.750]  All over the United States, drunk driving, assault,
[01:24:59.739 --> 01:25:00.820]  Arson.
[01:25:00.820 --> 01:25:01.640]  Rape.
[01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:04.261]  Child molestation.
[01:25:04.261 --> 01:25:15.847]  I've seen countless articles where the illegals get caught, and then the judges let them go with a $1 fine, $50 fine, $200 fine, and they just disappear into the ether.
[01:25:15.847 --> 01:25:25.172]  Imagine, we got 30 million people here who are illegal aliens from all over the world, and a large portion of them are criminals that have been fleeing justice in their own nations.
[01:25:25.172 --> 01:25:27.413]  They come here and they're just absolutely above the law.
[01:25:29.304 --> 01:25:36.709]  An improper lane change on Interstate 75 led to a nearly $105,000 windfall from the Monroe County Sheriff's Office.
[01:25:36.709 --> 01:25:48.877]  Deputy Bobby Queen, on Tuesday, saw a blue Mazda SRX6 make an improper lane change while traveling on I-75 near the 60-mile marker, according to Queen's report.
[01:25:48.877 --> 01:25:55.942]  When Queen stopped the car about 1.30 p.m., the driver said he was returning to Mexico in a rental vehicle after a three-day stay in New York City.
[01:25:55.942 --> 01:25:58.084]  A female accompanied the 32-year-old driver.
[01:25:59.127 --> 01:26:02.130]  With consent, the driver, Queen starts the vehicle.
[01:26:02.130 --> 01:26:04.112]  With consent.
[01:26:04.112 --> 01:26:06.134]  I found six vacuum-sealed packages of U.S.
[01:26:06.134 --> 01:26:10.498]  currency wrapped in tinfoil in the right rear quarter panel.
[01:26:10.498 --> 01:26:11.679]  You know why they wrap them in tinfoil?
[01:26:11.679 --> 01:26:15.223]  Because the scanners then can't read the little magnetic strip that's in them.
[01:26:16.957 --> 01:26:19.178]  Behind the carpet in the trunk, Queen wrote.
[01:26:19.178 --> 01:26:22.059]  Both occupants denied knowledge and ownership of the currency.
[01:26:22.059 --> 01:26:27.860]  Queen seized the $104,000 in cash and gave the driver a receipt for the money.
[01:26:27.860 --> 01:26:31.361]  The driver and the passenger were allowed to continue on their journey, according to the report.
[01:26:31.361 --> 01:26:35.323]  See, it's encouraged for them to be just turned loose.
[01:26:35.323 --> 01:26:38.104]  And this is what happens.
[01:26:38.104 --> 01:26:45.766]  I've been talking to somebody who works with the county, and I need to try to do an interview with them and have a voice changer.
[01:26:46.978 --> 01:27:09.205]  Because they don't want to be revealed who they are and they have shown me information they want to show me more documents where there's internal fights going on in Travis County and Austin because in one case they were showing me last year an illegal alien had crashed a car into somebody when he was drunk he was just let go no jail
[01:27:10.745 --> 01:27:20.219]  Then he, a few weeks later, crashed into a cop car with a cop in it transporting a suspect and hurt both the people inside.
[01:27:20.219 --> 01:27:21.741]  And you never see that on the news.
[01:27:21.741 --> 01:27:22.822]  And then still nothing was done.
[01:27:23.854 --> 01:27:29.300]  But they pull a citizen over, a Hispanic American, Black American, White American, Asian American.
[01:27:29.300 --> 01:27:32.384]  It is just bonanza time.
[01:27:32.384 --> 01:27:36.628]  I mean, they pull over one of the... They've been told, have your way with these people.
[01:27:36.628 --> 01:27:38.791]  Do whatever you want.
[01:27:38.791 --> 01:27:40.573]  Drive them into submission.
[01:27:40.573 --> 01:27:41.614]  Make them afraid of you.
[01:27:42.495 --> 01:27:45.839]  Remember the police chief in Bergen County a couple years ago?
[01:27:45.839 --> 01:27:47.882]  In fact, pull this up.
[01:27:47.882 --> 01:27:52.667]  Police chief admits black mask, black uniforms for intimidation.
[01:27:52.667 --> 01:27:54.289]  People won't believe it if I don't pull it up.
[01:27:54.289 --> 01:27:56.191]  We've always known it's for intimidation.
[01:27:56.191 --> 01:27:58.334]  And coming up, we have this Orwellian...
[01:27:59.275 --> 01:28:04.358]  Big Brother tax collection commercial that's airing, saying, Big Brother is watching you.
[01:28:04.358 --> 01:28:06.120]  We have control of you.
[01:28:06.120 --> 01:28:07.220]  Give us all the money.
[01:28:07.220 --> 01:28:12.023]  And it says it in this voice, like, we are the Borg.
[01:28:12.023 --> 01:28:13.564]  You will be assimilated.
[01:28:13.564 --> 01:28:15.246]  Resistance is futile.
[01:28:15.246 --> 01:28:17.067]  Paul in Tennessee, are you still there?
[01:28:17.067 --> 01:28:17.407]  Yes, sir.
[01:28:17.407 --> 01:28:18.288]  I was waiting for you.
[01:28:18.288 --> 01:28:20.209]  I want to thank you for bringing this to our attention.
[01:28:20.209 --> 01:28:21.510]  Now, what's your take on it?
[01:28:21.510 --> 01:28:23.631]  You're very welcome.
[01:28:23.631 --> 01:28:25.812]  I've seen this happen time and time again all over the country.
[01:28:25.812 --> 01:28:28.114]  I mean, before I lived in Tennessee, I was in Florida.
[01:28:28.963 --> 01:28:34.005]  And before that, I'm a Texan, too, so I've been all over the place.
[01:28:34.005 --> 01:28:35.985]  One more quick story from Florida.
[01:28:35.985 --> 01:28:41.627]  My parents had a vacant investment property down there that I maintain the law on.
[01:28:41.627 --> 01:28:48.890]  One day I went over there, there was a van with three Mexicans in it, directly in the middle of the front yard, stuck in the mud.
[01:28:48.890 --> 01:28:51.931]  And the thing had no tags on it or anything, and I'm going, this is kind of bad.
[01:28:51.931 --> 01:28:55.092]  I went over, I talked to them, and there had been a lot of robberies in the neighborhood.
[01:28:55.092 --> 01:28:57.213]  And I asked them, I said, you know, well, what's going on here?
[01:28:57.213 --> 01:28:58.173]  How come you're in the middle of the law?
[01:28:59.108 --> 01:29:02.691]  And, uh, they didn't speak a lick English, so I called the police.
[01:29:02.691 --> 01:29:06.014]  Because I was... I thought they were trying to attempt to rob the house.
[01:29:06.014 --> 01:29:08.336]  And, uh, it took the police 30 minutes to get there.
[01:29:08.336 --> 01:29:10.057]  By that time, they'd pulled the van out.
[01:29:10.057 --> 01:29:12.299]  I told the cop he went down that way.
[01:29:12.299 --> 01:29:14.341]  The cop found them.
[01:29:14.341 --> 01:29:19.185]  And, uh, then he came back to me and he said, uh... Yeah, he said, well, they were just test driving it.
[01:29:19.185 --> 01:29:20.386]  I said, well, did you arrest them?
[01:29:20.386 --> 01:29:22.608]  I said, they didn't have a tag on the van or anything.
[01:29:22.608 --> 01:29:25.350]  He goes, no, no, I just... They just said they were test driving it.
[01:29:25.350 --> 01:29:26.051]  Now, if that was me...
[01:29:26.741 --> 01:29:30.763]  My butt would have been in Sarasota County Jail quicker than you could say Jack Sparrow.
[01:29:30.763 --> 01:29:33.625]  And if you'd have talked back, you'd have been billy clubbed and tasered.
[01:29:33.625 --> 01:29:41.329]  Because you are a scum American who lives for one reason, to work for the state and pay money to Goldman Sachs.
[01:29:41.329 --> 01:29:45.852]  You are trash, the illegals are God, and you ought to thank them if they burn down major cities.
[01:29:45.852 --> 01:29:51.215]  It's what you deserve, trash America!
[01:29:51.215 --> 01:29:54.117]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.123 --> 01:30:00.886]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:30:12.693 --> 01:30:21.418]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:30:21.418 --> 01:30:23.539]  They sew pride in every stitch.

[01:30:27.398 --> 01:30:34.487]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[01:30:34.487 --> 01:30:37.511]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[01:30:39.561 --> 01:30:41.702]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:30:41.702 --> 01:30:43.483]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.

[01:32:00.690 --> 01:32:03.692]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:32:03.692 --> 01:32:09.036]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:32:09.036 --> 01:32:11.078]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:32:11.078 --> 01:32:16.081]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:32:16.081 --> 01:32:17.262]  How much do you want?
[01:32:17.262 --> 01:32:18.003]  When do you want it?
[01:32:18.363 --> 01:32:20.243]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:32:20.243 --> 01:32:21.324]  When will you need it?
[01:32:21.324 --> 01:32:23.524]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:32:23.524 --> 01:32:24.865]  Will there be any food?
[01:32:24.865 --> 01:32:26.385]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:32:26.385 --> 01:32:31.666]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:32:31.666 --> 01:32:35.247]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:32:35.247 --> 01:32:38.708]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:32:39.068 --> 01:32:40.289]  How much will you need?
[01:32:40.289 --> 01:32:41.189]  We don't know.
[01:32:41.189 --> 01:32:42.290]  How much do you want?
[01:32:42.290 --> 01:32:43.230]  All you can get.
[01:32:43.230 --> 01:32:44.330]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:32:44.330 --> 01:32:47.372]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:32:47.372 --> 01:32:49.553]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:32:49.553 --> 01:32:50.573]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[01:33:05.219 --> 01:33:06.199]  We are back live.
[01:33:06.199 --> 01:33:07.760]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:17.785]  Greg Pallast, ABC reporter to talk about the Goldman Sachs global banking takeover and what's happening in Greece and the United States is coming up for 30 minutes in the next hour.
[01:33:17.785 --> 01:33:20.966]  Then we'll continue with the news and your phone calls.
[01:33:20.966 --> 01:33:22.507]  Okay.
[01:33:22.507 --> 01:33:30.511]  Just to prove to you here yet again that if I just throw something out from a few years ago that I don't make it up.
[01:33:30.511 --> 01:33:30.751]  Okay.
[01:33:30.751 --> 01:33:33.312]  And then we're getting into the whole illegal alien situation.
[01:33:34.424 --> 01:33:46.572]  For PrisonPlanet.TV members, you can watch this on the document cam right now, but for those who are just listening on the radio, Google, Massachusetts police get black uniforms to instill sense of fear.
[01:33:46.572 --> 01:33:52.136]  And that's the police commissioner, William Fichette, saying that April 24, 2008.
[01:33:52.136 --> 01:33:56.959]  I told the guys to search engine, police get black uniforms to instill fear.
[01:33:56.959 --> 01:33:58.980]  They found one in Massachusetts.
[01:33:58.980 --> 01:34:02.583]  The one I was remembering was out of New Jersey.
[01:34:03.846 --> 01:34:09.148]  So there is a article on that front for everyone.
[01:34:09.148 --> 01:34:14.789]  Okay, continuing now, I did find this here in my stack.
[01:34:14.789 --> 01:34:17.690]  First, I want to show you a photo.
[01:34:17.690 --> 01:34:20.411]  We'll put it up on the main screen for folks so they can read it.
[01:34:20.411 --> 01:34:26.473]  And we have this photo posted up on InfoWars.com.
[01:34:26.473 --> 01:34:32.195]  It's a pro-illegal immigration protester threatens to murder police.
[01:34:35.620 --> 01:34:37.981]  A photo does tell a thousand words.
[01:34:37.981 --> 01:34:41.581]  You can get that up at InfoWars.com.
[01:34:41.581 --> 01:34:52.644]  And if you just go through the videos and photos online and randomly pause the signs in California, Texas, Arizona, Nevada, New York, Florida, this is not a joke sign.
[01:34:52.644 --> 01:34:56.945]  I mean, you can see the illegal alien protester there, and he's got his sign.
[01:34:56.945 --> 01:34:58.906]  Let's put it back up on screen for people.
[01:34:58.906 --> 01:35:01.966]  And I'm going to read this to folks here on air.
[01:35:01.966 --> 01:35:03.327]  Give us free.
[01:35:03.327 --> 01:35:04.227]  Free is underlined.
[01:35:05.495 --> 01:35:11.057]  Health care, jobs, no taxes, house, food.
[01:35:11.057 --> 01:35:12.498]  You owe us, America.
[01:35:12.498 --> 01:35:20.001]  Because the media has taught the illegals that they literally make the grass grow, the sun shine, that birds tweet.
[01:35:20.001 --> 01:35:25.903]  And then it says, we will shoot more police in Arizona until we get free.
[01:35:25.903 --> 01:35:27.064]  Yeah, what's going on in Mexico?
[01:35:27.064 --> 01:35:30.445]  20 plus thousand dead people in the last two years.
[01:35:30.445 --> 01:35:32.006]  Over what, 7,000 of them police?
[01:35:33.649 --> 01:35:34.769]  We will shoot police.
[01:35:34.769 --> 01:35:42.812]  Can you imagine if I went out with a sign saying, arrest the Federal Reserve Chiefs, give us our country back, or I will shoot police?
[01:35:42.812 --> 01:35:44.133]  I would never do that.
[01:35:44.133 --> 01:35:45.593]  I'm calling for nonviolence.
[01:35:45.593 --> 01:35:59.158]  So I have the ADL, Southern Poverty Law Center, New York Times, Time Magazine, London Guardian, New York Daily News, Austin American-Statesman, writing articles saying I'm calling for violence, and that I supported Joe Stack flying a plane into a building, when day one,
[01:35:59.938 --> 01:36:02.359]  Within an hour and a half of that happening, I went live on air.
[01:36:02.359 --> 01:36:02.899]  Less than an hour.
[01:36:02.899 --> 01:36:04.920]  It happened right before 10 o'clock.
[01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:06.401]  I went on air at 11.
[01:36:06.401 --> 01:36:07.742]  I said, this will be blamed on me.
[01:36:07.742 --> 01:36:08.742]  Watch.
[01:36:08.742 --> 01:36:09.943]  And this is a staged event.
[01:36:09.943 --> 01:36:10.903]  And the evidence came out.
[01:36:10.903 --> 01:36:12.084]  It was staged.
[01:36:12.084 --> 01:36:13.564]  They had the emergency crews there.
[01:36:13.564 --> 01:36:15.045]  People said there was no one in the plane.
[01:36:15.045 --> 01:36:16.445]  He was involved with Homeland Security.
[01:36:16.445 --> 01:36:17.786]  His family says it's a cover-up.
[01:36:17.786 --> 01:36:23.789]  The guy that owned the hangar, the small hangar his plane was in, is the top Homeland Security expert on remote-control aircraft.
[01:36:23.789 --> 01:36:26.250]  And within two and a half hours, they blamed me for it.
[01:36:28.581 --> 01:36:30.363]  I mean, I know how this works.
[01:36:30.363 --> 01:36:32.145]  So here I am being blamed.
[01:36:32.145 --> 01:36:33.647]  Here's the Tea Party being blamed.
[01:36:33.647 --> 01:36:38.953]  You have this aborted truck bomb in Times Square on Commie Day on May Day.
[01:36:40.441 --> 01:36:48.227]  And the media first says it's Al Qaeda, an Israeli front group known for putting out fake videos, posting videos saying Taliban's taking credit.
[01:36:48.227 --> 01:36:49.528]  Turns out that's fake.
[01:36:49.528 --> 01:36:52.069]  Now the media says, is it a Tea Party person?
[01:36:52.069 --> 01:36:58.614]  They show a white male around the car saying maybe it's him, and we're just bracing for it to be blamed on the American people right now.
[01:36:58.614 --> 01:37:04.879]  Meanwhile, illegal aliens, and I'm going to show you these mainstream news articles, here it is, Santa Cruz Sentinel.
[01:37:06.601 --> 01:37:10.983]  Downtown Santa Cruz, windows broken on dozens of businesses, now over 20.
[01:37:10.983 --> 01:37:15.606]  Porch of Cafe set on fire.
[01:37:15.606 --> 01:37:18.727]  Here's the Star Tribune Associated Press.
[01:37:18.727 --> 01:37:25.471]  Eighteen businesses damaged after immigrants' rights march turns violent in Santa Cruz, California.
[01:37:25.471 --> 01:37:28.793]  And again, that's from yesterday, it's now more businesses.
[01:37:28.793 --> 01:37:31.754]  And it says close to 20 businesses were damaged.
[01:37:31.754 --> 01:37:33.075]  And these articles go on to talk about
[01:37:34.008 --> 01:37:41.094]  People with burning torches, running around setting fire to a restaurant with families in it eating.
[01:37:41.094 --> 01:37:46.639]  Now, if I did that or you did that, you'd be charged with attempted murder, and we should be charged with attempted murder.
[01:37:46.639 --> 01:37:57.749]  If anybody, black, white, Hispanic, purple, green, polka dotted, I don't care, you run around, start setting fires to restaurants full of people, you need to go to prison for about 50 years.
[01:37:57.749 --> 01:37:57.870]  No.
[01:37:58.851 --> 01:38:03.055]  I don't know if I have time, but we have the ABC newscast that was local.
[01:38:03.055 --> 01:38:04.997]  It's a national blackout.
[01:38:04.997 --> 01:38:08.381]  It's in Paul Watson's article about this, if you want to go watch it in full.
[01:38:08.381 --> 01:38:17.811]  You can hear business owners in the background when the news does a live report never saying it was an illegal alien march, screaming, deport the illegals, they did this.
[01:38:19.853 --> 01:38:23.514]  So the local news will not even say it was an illegal alien march.
[01:38:23.514 --> 01:38:30.156]  We went and pulled up the local websites where they were saying a week before they were going to go out there and do this and they were calling for violence.
[01:38:30.156 --> 01:38:36.158]  Now, were the police watching the illegal alien groups saying they were going to go engage in violence a week before?
[01:38:36.158 --> 01:38:37.238]  No.
[01:38:37.238 --> 01:38:37.698]  No, they weren't.
[01:38:38.971 --> 01:38:46.176]  Were the police watching these groups when they attacked police a week and a half ago in Phoenix, screaming, we will kill you with pickaxes?
[01:38:46.176 --> 01:38:48.077]  I played that clip earlier in the hour?
[01:38:48.077 --> 01:38:49.018]  No.
[01:38:49.018 --> 01:38:49.398]  No.
[01:38:49.398 --> 01:38:59.565]  The police are too busy training with the army, with training manuals with my name in it, saying I'm calling for their murder, I'm calling for death and killing, and the Tea Parties are violent terrorists.
[01:39:00.505 --> 01:39:03.266]  That's what's going on in America.
[01:39:03.266 --> 01:39:05.547]  That's what's happening in this country.
[01:39:05.547 --> 01:39:16.550]  And in the sickening ABC piece you can go watch that's posted in Watson's article that boils all this down, they talk to two witnesses who support it and say, I understand why they did it.
[01:39:16.550 --> 01:39:18.551]  They have a good reason to do it.
[01:39:18.551 --> 01:39:22.992]  This disgusting newscast defends what happened.
[01:39:22.992 --> 01:39:24.532]  You want to go watch the video?
[01:39:24.532 --> 01:39:29.214]  We've got it all boiled down to the violence all over the country, linked, including Santa Cruz, California.
[01:39:30.555 --> 01:39:33.696]  Pro-illegal immigration thugs terrorize Santa Cruz.
[01:39:33.696 --> 01:39:35.216]  Corporate media shrugs.
[01:39:35.216 --> 01:39:39.397]  And you can go into the article and watch the video I'm talking about.
[01:39:39.397 --> 01:39:41.698]  The cover-up.
[01:39:41.698 --> 01:39:46.179]  The cover-up of the torching that is going on.
[01:39:46.179 --> 01:39:47.359]  Here's another one.
[01:39:47.359 --> 01:39:54.521]  This is out of ABC News, KGOTV.
[01:39:54.521 --> 01:39:58.142]  Thousands across Bay Area protest Arizona law.
[01:39:58.142 --> 01:39:59.662]  And then buried in the article
[01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:05.178]  It talks about how they assaulted a counter-demonstration of Tea Party people.
[01:40:06.072 --> 01:40:08.513]  Beat them up, screaming, you are racist.
[01:40:08.513 --> 01:40:09.774]  See?
[01:40:09.774 --> 01:40:17.939]  If you don't like groups with signs saying, we're gonna kill cops, we're gonna burn things down, we're gonna kill you with pickaxes, and you say, look, man, the country's going bankrupt.
[01:40:17.939 --> 01:40:20.960]  Look, the big banks are the ones that ruined Mexico.
[01:40:20.960 --> 01:40:22.101]  Your country's collapsing.
[01:40:22.101 --> 01:40:23.982]  It's going into a total police state.
[01:40:23.982 --> 01:40:28.545]  You don't have a right to come up here and declare this Mexico or Latin America.
[01:40:28.545 --> 01:40:32.247]  And then when you do that, you get physically attacked and the mainstream media
[01:40:33.376 --> 01:40:40.861]  Basically engages in a giant cover-up of the entire situation.
[01:40:40.861 --> 01:40:50.188]  Then I have several other articles dealing with what's actually happening in Mexico right now.
[01:40:50.188 --> 01:40:55.311]  Give me a document cam shot on this boys at PrisonPlanet.TV for viewers.
[01:40:55.311 --> 01:40:59.214]  Mexico to fingerprint phone users in fight
[01:41:01.377 --> 01:41:02.778]  To fight crime.
[01:41:02.778 --> 01:41:03.739]  That's Reuters.
[01:41:03.739 --> 01:41:05.820]  Here's another one.
[01:41:05.820 --> 01:41:06.701]  London Guardian.
[01:41:06.701 --> 01:41:09.663]  Caught in the crossfire of an unwinnable war.
[01:41:09.663 --> 01:41:10.464]  Oh, they could win it.
[01:41:10.464 --> 01:41:14.647]  They could decriminalize the drugs and they'd have almost no value.
[01:41:14.647 --> 01:41:17.008]  Be as valuable as coffee or beans.
[01:41:17.008 --> 01:41:18.509]  Be as valuable as corn.
[01:41:18.509 --> 01:41:19.930]  Maybe a little more.
[01:41:19.930 --> 01:41:21.652]  But no, that's never going to happen.
[01:41:21.652 --> 01:41:27.316]  You cannot decriminalize it because that's what the private intelligence agencies are using to overthrow
[01:41:28.618 --> 01:41:34.539]  A hundred plus years ago, China to overthrow Afghanistan, to overthrow the United States, to overthrow Mexico.
[01:41:34.539 --> 01:41:37.480]  And remember what I played yesterday?
[01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:39.120]  Remember what I played here on air?
[01:41:39.120 --> 01:41:41.281]  In fact, I ought to just play it again for new listeners.
[01:41:41.281 --> 01:41:49.362]  Fox News comes out and reports what we already knew, but the incredible thing is it's out in the open, that the U.S.
[01:41:49.362 --> 01:41:58.104]  Army is helping grow and protect the record levels of opium, since our government took over, that are pouring out of Afghanistan into the United States, and it's what we have to do.
[01:42:01.817 --> 01:42:04.438]  In fact, look right over here.
[01:42:04.438 --> 01:42:05.218]  Look right here.
[01:42:05.218 --> 01:42:07.159]  Document cam on this.
[01:42:07.159 --> 01:42:11.380]  NATO rejects Russian call for Afghan poppy spring.
[01:42:11.380 --> 01:42:14.421]  The Russians said, why don't you just eradicate the poppy fields?
[01:42:14.421 --> 01:42:15.982]  It would take a few weeks to do it.
[01:42:15.982 --> 01:42:17.262]  Why don't you just spray them?
[01:42:17.262 --> 01:42:20.923]  And NATO said, we're not going to do that.
[01:42:20.923 --> 01:42:22.424]  Here's the New York Times.
[01:42:22.424 --> 01:42:25.985]  US turns a blind eye to opium in Afghan town.
[01:42:25.985 --> 01:42:27.065]  This is a tactic they use.
[01:42:27.065 --> 01:42:28.146]  It's going on all over the country.
[01:42:29.349 --> 01:42:33.774]  But they just come out with one town where it's happening.
[01:42:33.774 --> 01:42:38.879]  Well, we played you the video of the Marine commander saying, I don't like it, but we've got to do this.
[01:42:38.879 --> 01:42:41.141]  We've got to help them grow their crops.
[01:42:41.141 --> 01:42:42.923]  Because if we don't, they'll side with the Taliban.
[01:42:45.552 --> 01:42:48.573]  And the Orwellian headline is, Fighting the Opium Trade, U.S.
[01:42:48.573 --> 01:42:50.773]  Troops Fight Vicious Circle.
[01:42:50.773 --> 01:42:52.133]  In fact, people won't believe it.
[01:42:52.133 --> 01:42:53.254]  Cue up the video to the start.
[01:42:53.254 --> 01:42:58.055]  Let's just play a few minutes of that before I explain what's going to be done to the United States and Mexico.
[01:42:58.055 --> 01:43:02.175]  This is the implosion of North America into the North American Union.
[01:43:02.175 --> 01:43:14.918]  Judicial Watch sued in 2007, got the documents from the SPP meeting, Security Prosperity Partnership, and they said, we will use deteriorating security issues in Mexico to merge the three nations.
[01:43:16.007 --> 01:43:17.951]  And to have our military joint drain.
[01:43:17.951 --> 01:43:23.803]  We will use biological events like flu and we will use financial collapse to do it.
[01:43:23.803 --> 01:43:25.486]  Mexico has now completely...
[01:43:26.636 --> 01:43:27.836]  Collapsed.
[01:43:27.836 --> 01:43:32.417]  And look, the same thing is now being proposed here in the United States.
[01:43:32.417 --> 01:43:41.479]  Everyone that gets a cell phone under the 1996 law, your cell phone's being tracked, traced, everything's being recorded, everything's being controlled.
[01:43:41.479 --> 01:43:42.959]  It's totally illegal.
[01:43:42.959 --> 01:43:47.900]  They pass it in a spending bill to put the control grid in, but legally it's unlawful.
[01:43:47.900 --> 01:43:48.820]  Here's Reuters.
[01:43:48.820 --> 01:43:52.321]  Mexico to fingerprint phone users in crime fight.
[01:43:52.921 --> 01:43:53.942]  In a crime fight!
[01:43:53.942 --> 01:43:59.486]  The government is waging war against smaller cartels that aren't laundering their money through their system.
[01:43:59.486 --> 01:44:00.106]  When U.S.
[01:44:00.106 --> 01:44:06.371]  troops are down in Colombia, it's on record that they have GPS systems where they only spray certain coca fields.
[01:44:06.371 --> 01:44:09.553]  They don't spray the others that they control.
[01:44:09.553 --> 01:44:19.620]  You see, so there is some war going on in Afghanistan, but that's only to mop up groups and tribes that are growing poppies that produce opium and heroin that aren't paying their cut.
[01:44:20.566 --> 01:44:23.270]  It's $500 billion a year industry out of Afghanistan.
[01:44:23.270 --> 01:44:28.436]  Over $500 billion on narcotics coming into the United States out of Mexico every year.
[01:44:28.436 --> 01:44:34.925]  And now because the troops are speaking up, now because the troops are informed, now because the troops are involved, now because the troops know what's going on.
[01:44:36.374 --> 01:44:38.075]  They're going, why are we here growing opium?
[01:44:38.075 --> 01:44:40.976]  They have to come out and hide it in plain view and go, it's no big deal guys.
[01:44:40.976 --> 01:44:41.876]  Everybody knows.
[01:44:41.876 --> 01:44:42.757]  See, here's Geraldo.
[01:44:42.757 --> 01:44:43.837]  We're on TV.
[01:44:43.837 --> 01:44:48.299]  They have the troops all stand around and they hear Geraldo explain how it's okay with the commander.
[01:44:48.299 --> 01:44:49.619]  To just normalize it.
[01:44:49.619 --> 01:44:50.840]  To hide the thing in plain view.
[01:44:52.625 --> 01:44:59.189]  Remember just six months ago I was a kook liar for saying our government's controlling almost all the opium in Afghanistan and shipping it in?
[01:44:59.189 --> 01:45:00.490]  Now it's in your face.
[01:45:00.490 --> 01:45:09.135]  But see how they use this police state as a pretext to control our lives, run checkpoints, federalize our police, and then in Mexico they just tell the public.
[01:45:09.855 --> 01:45:24.591]  You've got a thumbprint to get a phone, everything you do is recorded, everywhere you go is tracked, or you can't have a cell phone, and what Carlos Slim, the richest guy in the world, he owns almost all of the cell phone systems, has almost a complete monopoly in Mexico.
[01:45:24.591 --> 01:45:32.098]  One of the poorest groups of people, the richest guy, reportedly, on paper, he's nouveau riche, the real money hides it, like the Rockefellers and others.
[01:45:33.041 --> 01:45:37.163]  Mexico to fingerprint phone users in crime fight.
[01:45:37.163 --> 01:45:48.129]  Mexico will start a national register of mobile phone users that will include fingerprinting all customers in an effort to catch criminals who use the devices to extort money and negotiate kidnapping ransoms.
[01:45:49.212 --> 01:45:59.155]  So see, because somebody uses a phone for drug dealing or somebody might use a phone for kidnapping, we've got to now register and track everything you do.
[01:45:59.155 --> 01:46:01.515]  Somebody might use propane as a bomb.
[01:46:01.515 --> 01:46:03.336]  Now we've got to register propane.
[01:46:03.336 --> 01:46:05.657]  Somebody might use gasoline as a bomb.
[01:46:05.657 --> 01:46:10.038]  Now we've got to register and make you have a license to buy gas and track everything you do.
[01:46:10.038 --> 01:46:12.238]  Somebody might use a car as a weapon.
[01:46:12.238 --> 01:46:13.699]  Now we've got to restrict your cars.
[01:46:14.199 --> 01:46:15.860]  Somebody might use a baseball bat.
[01:46:15.860 --> 01:46:17.681]  Now we've got to restrict baseball bats.
[01:46:17.681 --> 01:46:19.282]  Somebody might use a butcher knife.
[01:46:19.282 --> 01:46:20.642]  England's already doing that.
[01:46:20.642 --> 01:46:22.023]  Making you get licenses for knives.
[01:46:22.023 --> 01:46:23.884]  They're proposing it.
[01:46:23.884 --> 01:46:25.765]  Somebody might use a gun in a crime.
[01:46:25.765 --> 01:46:28.026]  So we've got to take all your guns or register them.
[01:46:28.026 --> 01:46:29.787]  See how this psychology works?
[01:46:29.787 --> 01:46:38.772]  Mexico will start a national register of mobile phone users that will include fingerprinting all customers in an effort to catch criminals who use devices to extort money and negotiate kidnapping ransoms.
[01:46:39.392 --> 01:46:43.295]  No, now they'll just come in with sat phones that cost 500 bucks, as if they won't get those.
[01:46:43.295 --> 01:46:45.196]  No, they want to keep track of their slaves.
[01:46:45.196 --> 01:46:47.017]  This is total martial law.
[01:46:47.017 --> 01:46:57.245]  Under a new law, pushed on Monday, and due to be enforced in April, mobile phone companies will have a year to build up a database of their clients, complete with fingerprints.
[01:46:57.245 --> 01:47:01.488]  The idea would be to match calls and messages to the phone owners.
[01:47:02.088 --> 01:47:04.189]  Hundreds of people are kidnapped in Mexico every year.
[01:47:04.189 --> 01:47:05.330]  How about thousands?
[01:47:05.330 --> 01:47:11.174]  And the number of victims is rising sharply as drug gangs under pressure from any army crackdown seek new income.
[01:47:11.174 --> 01:47:16.277]  This is lawmakers pushed the bill through Congress last week.
[01:47:16.277 --> 01:47:20.500]  So that's the type of news that we have here.
[01:47:21.414 --> 01:47:25.237]  This is a total criminal system taking over.
[01:47:25.237 --> 01:47:34.483]  And the United States, in the SPP, North American Union documents, three years ago they said, we will use deteriorating security in the U.S.
[01:47:34.483 --> 01:47:38.786]  from Mexico as a pretext to go after people's freedoms.
[01:47:38.786 --> 01:47:49.634]  They said we'll use a global government, North American Union, this is a quote, by stealth approach, also for carbon taxes.
[01:47:51.181 --> 01:47:53.782]  And who runs that SPP Council?
[01:47:53.782 --> 01:47:56.144]  The State Departments of Mexico, Canada, and the U.S.
[01:47:56.144 --> 01:48:06.229]  and they sit on boards, this is in the documents, thousands of pages, that we've read and then shot video of and I put my film in-game, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[01:48:07.189 --> 01:48:09.651]  All admitted what they're going to do.
[01:48:09.651 --> 01:48:14.513]  If you don't decriminalize drugs now, we are going to collapse just like Mexico.
[01:48:14.513 --> 01:48:20.957]  And the kidnappings are already exploding everywhere, and when the illegals kidnap your kids, they just keep it real quiet.
[01:48:20.957 --> 01:48:28.321]  If somebody else kidnaps a kid, it's frothing and crying and freaking out, and the feds are going to save us, and it's all over the news and press conferences.
[01:48:28.321 --> 01:48:35.986]  But when people are being kidnapped every day, in Texas, in Arizona, in California, in Nevada, your kid doesn't even get a milk carton.
[01:48:37.423 --> 01:48:43.867]  And then you pay the 500 grand or whatever, your whole family sells everything they got, and then you might be lucky if your kid comes back.
[01:48:43.867 --> 01:48:47.650]  And they chop a finger off, send it back, doesn't make the news.
[01:48:47.650 --> 01:48:53.034]  Illegals burn Santa Cruz, set fires, run around racially attacking people.
[01:48:53.034 --> 01:49:03.481]  Makes the local news, but on the local news they don't even tell you it was illegals, but the AP went and noticed it was their own website bragging it was a quote, immigrant march.
[01:49:03.481 --> 01:49:04.442]  Where's that headline again?
[01:49:04.442 --> 01:49:04.862]  I'll just, uh...
[01:49:06.684 --> 01:49:09.606]  I'll just neurotically read you that headline again.
[01:49:09.606 --> 01:49:13.249]  Here we go.
[01:49:13.249 --> 01:49:17.332]  ABC News San Francisco.
[01:49:17.332 --> 01:49:17.872]  AP.
[01:49:17.872 --> 01:49:22.015]  18 businesses damaged after immigrants' rights march turns violent.
[01:49:22.015 --> 01:49:23.136]  Turns violent.
[01:49:23.136 --> 01:49:25.918]  Riot breaks out in downtown Santa Cruz.
[01:49:25.918 --> 01:49:26.859]  Carrying torches.
[01:49:28.646 --> 01:49:35.271]  But the mainstream media wants to know why everybody's tuning out, why people don't trust them, why people don't believe anything they say anymore.
[01:49:35.271 --> 01:49:37.393]  It's because of stuff like this.
[01:49:37.393 --> 01:49:39.575]  It should be all over the news what happened.
[01:49:39.575 --> 01:49:42.957]  We're going to come back and take your calls and Greg Pallis is coming up with us.
[01:49:42.957 --> 01:49:44.879]  And I haven't even gotten into the banking takeover yet.
[01:49:44.879 --> 01:49:50.643]  We'll be covering that with him.
[01:49:50.643 --> 01:49:57.629]  And then I want to get into this article that is so important.
[01:49:58.669 --> 01:50:02.252]  Orwellian Big Brother Tax Collection Commercial airs in Pennsylvania.
[01:50:02.252 --> 01:50:04.473]  Wait till you see and hear this.
[01:50:04.473 --> 01:50:11.278]  But closing out on the subject of Mexico, here's another one we mentioned earlier, KnoxNews.com, Knoxville News.
[01:50:11.278 --> 01:50:16.822]  Deputy sees $105,000 and for Mexicans to deny cash was theirs, they just let him go.
[01:50:16.822 --> 01:50:18.083]  Oh!
[01:50:18.083 --> 01:50:20.545]  You got $105,000 of drug money in your car?
[01:50:20.545 --> 01:50:23.107]  You're illegal aliens in the U.S.?
[01:50:23.107 --> 01:50:24.248]  You're driving a rent car?
[01:50:24.248 --> 01:50:25.769]  Bye-bye, you're gone.
[01:50:25.769 --> 01:50:26.670]  We're gonna let you go.
[01:50:28.069 --> 01:50:37.836]  Meanwhile, they're announcing that in the legalization immigration bill, it's a national ID card, this is AP, included in Democratic immigration bill.
[01:50:39.161 --> 01:50:40.743]  But citizens have to have it.
[01:50:40.743 --> 01:50:42.285]  The illegals are exempt.
[01:50:42.285 --> 01:50:46.269]  So see, they tell you there's an amnesty bill, and it is an amnesty bill.
[01:50:46.269 --> 01:50:49.112]  It fixes the illegal alien problem because it just legalizes them.
[01:50:49.112 --> 01:50:57.521]  But then you as a citizen have got a federal ID you've got to have to get your paycheck and to buy and sell for the new national sales tax.
[01:50:57.521 --> 01:50:59.384]  You've got to have that new card, slaves.
[01:51:01.555 --> 01:51:03.296]  Oh, my sinuses!
[01:51:03.296 --> 01:51:05.237]  They feel like they'll explode!
[01:51:05.237 --> 01:51:06.058]  Sinus pressure.

[01:51:09.080 --> 01:51:14.943]  You've tried everything to get relief, but your sinus distress just keeps coming back and robbing you of the healthy life you deserve.
[01:51:14.943 --> 01:51:15.683]  Sound familiar?

[01:51:16.744 --> 01:51:20.386]  Statistics show that 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress.
[01:51:20.386 --> 01:51:25.429]  Fact is, 67 products merely treat the symptoms and don't get to the cause of your sinus problem.

[01:52:01.273 --> 01:52:02.594]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:02.594 --> 01:52:08.175]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:08.175 --> 01:52:13.197]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:13.197 --> 01:52:18.759]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:52:18.759 --> 01:52:23.980]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:52:23.980 --> 01:52:25.861]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[01:52:26.300 --> 01:52:31.103]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:52:31.103 --> 01:52:32.224]  And here's the best part.
[01:52:32.224 --> 01:52:35.286]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:52:35.286 --> 01:52:38.909]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.

[01:52:45.513 --> 01:52:46.574]  Remember, in a real crisis,
[01:52:55.410 --> 01:52:57.952]  Non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.

[01:53:59.699 --> 01:54:00.460]  You'll be glad you did.
[01:54:04.417 --> 01:54:06.519]  This is breaking hot off the presses.
[01:54:06.519 --> 01:54:08.540]  We're printing it off right now.
[01:54:08.540 --> 01:54:12.803]  Judges ruled the Hattari militia can be released on their own recognizance.
[01:54:12.803 --> 01:54:20.569]  It was all a giant hoax with feds inside for years, just trying to get one of them to say, yeah, we may have to fight the government someday.
[01:54:21.249 --> 01:54:28.613]  I mean, you get some militia guys, a former school teacher administrator, to say, yeah, the New World Order's coming down on us, we may have to do something sometime.
[01:54:28.613 --> 01:54:32.535]  They had an FBI agent and an informant inside posing as their members.
[01:54:32.535 --> 01:54:36.797]  We're now going to be able to find out, hopefully, who those feds were.
[01:54:36.797 --> 01:54:38.818]  But we know that they provocateured it.
[01:54:38.818 --> 01:54:40.299]  We know it was a setup.
[01:54:40.299 --> 01:54:43.181]  I warned Hitari in August of last year they were being set up.
[01:54:44.346 --> 01:54:50.309]  So of course, feds out there posing as militia commanders criticize me saying, don't you say you hate the militia?
[01:54:50.309 --> 01:54:51.509]  I never said that.
[01:54:51.509 --> 01:54:53.130]  That's more straw man lies.
[01:54:53.130 --> 01:54:56.472]  I said they set up Atari and I was right.
[01:54:56.472 --> 01:55:01.954]  Okay, so judge, militia members can leave jail until trial.
[01:55:01.954 --> 01:55:03.855]  They better watch their butts.
[01:55:03.855 --> 01:55:06.016]  This is a big defeat for the globalists.
[01:55:06.016 --> 01:55:12.579]  Judge says nine members of the Michigan-based militia accused of trying to plot war against the government can be released from jail while awaiting trial.
[01:55:12.579 --> 01:55:13.020]  This is AP.
[01:55:13.920 --> 01:55:14.140]  U.S.
[01:55:14.140 --> 01:55:20.103]  District Judge Victoria Roberts on Monday overturned the April 2nd decision of a federal magistrate judge.
[01:55:20.103 --> 01:55:25.285]  She says all can be released with electronic monitoring devices and other strict conditions.
[01:55:25.285 --> 01:55:30.928]  The government says the nine members of the Southern Michigan militia called Atari are radicals who plan to kill police.
[01:55:30.928 --> 01:55:31.348]  Really?
[01:55:31.348 --> 01:55:33.489]  Show the photo who said they'll kill police.
[01:55:33.489 --> 01:55:37.731]  Show the illegal aliens out there saying they're going to kill us with pickaxes and they're going to kill police.
[01:55:38.331 --> 01:55:46.301]  That's an act of terrorism to say, give me free health care, give me free rent, give me a free house, or I will kill police.
[01:55:46.301 --> 01:55:48.243]  Says, give us free health care!
[01:55:48.243 --> 01:55:48.744]  Jobs!
[01:55:50.242 --> 01:55:52.763]  No taxes, house, food.
[01:55:52.763 --> 01:55:54.203]  You owe us, America.
[01:55:54.203 --> 01:55:57.865]  We will shoot more police in Arizona until we get free.
[01:55:57.865 --> 01:55:59.705]  And look at that guy.
[01:55:59.705 --> 01:56:03.427]  Bottom dollar, that's an illegal alien.
[01:56:03.427 --> 01:56:09.289]  I've been to rallies where they're wearing Plan of San Diego shirts, and I went and found out what Plan of San Diego means.
[01:56:09.289 --> 01:56:13.870]  I didn't know because this guy was sitting there going, you'll get this.
[01:56:13.870 --> 01:56:15.031]  And I was like, I get what?
[01:56:15.868 --> 01:56:17.348]  And people said, you don't know what that means?
[01:56:17.348 --> 01:56:19.909]  That's the means he wants to kill you.
[01:56:19.909 --> 01:56:22.830]  Well, I mean, there it is!
[01:56:22.830 --> 01:56:26.191]  There it is right there!
[01:56:26.191 --> 01:56:39.694]  Meanwhile, they infiltrate Hattari for years, they have other militias run by feds, we told you this day one, that were the ones tattling on them, lying about them, doing all of this, and boom, there you have it.
[01:56:39.694 --> 01:56:40.794]  Now, why did the judge do this?
[01:56:40.794 --> 01:56:43.995]  Because there was no evidence they were planning violence, it was all made up.
[01:56:46.394 --> 01:56:52.837]  Defense lawyers say it was just a case of irrational, hateful speech.
[01:56:52.837 --> 01:56:56.658]  So they're now going to release them pending trial.
[01:56:56.658 --> 01:57:02.141]  Militia accused of trying to plot war against the government can be released from jail on bond.
[01:57:02.141 --> 01:57:09.304]  Or it could be that the feds know they have so little evidence that they want to release them hoping one of them does something wrong.
[01:57:10.816 --> 01:57:11.997]  Man, we have got to listen.
[01:57:11.997 --> 01:57:18.301]  For anybody in Michigan, I need to talk to those Hitari people as soon as they get out.
[01:57:18.301 --> 01:57:27.006]  And I need to talk to them, because they're going to be told not to talk, and find out who exactly was the FBI agent and informant in their group of nine.
[01:57:27.006 --> 01:57:28.167]  That means only seven!
[01:57:29.306 --> 01:57:29.546]  I think
[01:57:47.932 --> 01:57:52.854]  Because all these other towns are going bankrupt and they're laying off as much as half of their police forces.
[01:57:52.854 --> 01:57:56.575]  We better set up some kind of police force when things collapse.
[01:57:56.575 --> 01:58:00.936]  Oh, that turns into he wanted to be a king and have his own country.
[01:58:00.936 --> 01:58:04.658]  Oh, we saw headlines about how one of them killed their cat.
[01:58:04.658 --> 01:58:07.739]  No, it turned out the cat had cancer and was dying.
[01:58:07.739 --> 01:58:13.080]  And a lot of people in the country, for those that don't know, don't take their animal in to be lethally injected.
[01:58:13.080 --> 01:58:14.461]  They just take them out back and shoot them.
[01:58:15.899 --> 01:58:18.201]  But again, people think it's brutal to kill a chicken and eat it.
[01:58:18.201 --> 01:58:19.982]  Where do you think chickens come from?
[01:58:19.982 --> 01:58:22.964]  That's what people do in rural areas.
[01:58:22.964 --> 01:58:26.967]  You know, if any of the Hattari owned chickens, they'd say, they murdered chickens for fun.
[01:58:26.967 --> 01:58:29.189]  No, they butchered chickens for food.
[01:58:29.189 --> 01:58:31.831]  You see, that's the same way they manipulate everything.
[01:58:31.831 --> 01:58:33.232]  So that's breaking news there.
[01:58:33.232 --> 01:58:35.554]  Let's go ahead and get Greg Palast on the line.
[01:58:35.554 --> 01:58:37.135]  Then I'm going to get into all this other news.
[01:58:37.135 --> 01:58:39.177]  But the banking takeover, when we get back.
[01:58:39.177 --> 01:58:44.621]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:50.737 --> 01:58:52.038]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:58:52.038 --> 01:58:57.644]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:58:57.644 --> 01:59:02.649]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:59:02.649 --> 01:59:07.694]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:59:08.214 --> 01:59:13.438]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:59:13.438 --> 01:59:15.759]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:59:15.759 --> 01:59:20.562]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:59:20.562 --> 01:59:21.683]  And here's the best part.
[01:59:21.683 --> 01:59:24.745]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:59:24.745 --> 01:59:28.368]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:59:28.368 --> 01:59:31.550]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:59:31.550 --> 01:59:33.791]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:59:33.791 --> 01:59:34.712]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:59:38.434 --> 01:59:42.577]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:59:42.577 --> 01:59:47.401]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:59:47.401 --> 01:59:53.766]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:59:53.766 --> 01:59:56.148]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.148 --> 02:00:05.434]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.434 --> 02:00:06.035]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.716 --> 02:00:11.178]  The last year and a half I've been trying to get back in shape.
[02:00:11.178 --> 02:00:15.799]  After years of not working out, I tell you, it is rough.
[02:00:15.799 --> 02:00:16.760]  Jogged this morning.
[02:00:32.247 --> 02:00:37.268]  I went out to the lake Saturday, swam a little over 1,000 yards.
[02:00:37.268 --> 02:00:44.569]  That isn't a lot for a good swimmer, but for me, 1,000 yards, that's... I pulled something in my neck.
[02:00:44.569 --> 02:00:50.270]  So, the whole time I'm on TV today, I may be wincing with the pain.
[02:00:50.270 --> 02:00:54.511]  Just thought I'd mention that because they cut to me early and I was like all contorted in pain.
[02:00:54.511 --> 02:00:55.531]  That's not your fault.
[02:00:55.531 --> 02:00:57.211]  Hey, I got Advil.
[02:00:57.211 --> 02:00:59.332]  I'm taking more Advil.
[02:00:59.332 --> 02:01:00.072]  That's what it takes.
[02:01:00.072 --> 02:01:00.772]  I don't have any water.
[02:01:02.346 --> 02:01:03.846]  That's what it takes to get back in shape.
[02:01:03.846 --> 02:01:05.987]  No pain, no gain.
[02:01:05.987 --> 02:01:08.647]  And, uh, I seem a little bit out of it today.
[02:01:08.647 --> 02:01:11.008]  That's what's going on.
[02:01:11.008 --> 02:01:15.649]  Okay, um, excuse me just a moment.
[02:01:15.649 --> 02:01:22.671]  I've got like this charley horse right in your neck, right where it meets your, uh, I guess that's your trap right there.
[02:01:22.671 --> 02:01:23.791]  Whew!
[02:01:23.791 --> 02:01:26.732]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, getting my composure there from a muscle spasm.
[02:01:28.956 --> 02:01:33.217]  It was easy swimming 1,000 yards, but it's the soreness of my back now.
[02:01:33.217 --> 02:01:34.997]  I mean, how out of shape?
[02:01:34.997 --> 02:01:35.737]  You swim 1,000 yards.
[02:01:35.737 --> 02:01:38.378]  I don't know, how many laps is that in an Olympic pool?
[02:01:38.378 --> 02:01:40.238]  I don't know.
[02:01:40.238 --> 02:01:41.258]  What is 1,000 yards?
[02:01:41.258 --> 02:01:42.278]  How much of a mile is that?
[02:01:42.278 --> 02:01:47.439]  Is that like three-quarters of a mile?
[02:01:47.439 --> 02:01:48.480]  Now do me a calculation.
[02:01:48.480 --> 02:01:52.240]  What's 1,000 yards?
[02:01:52.240 --> 02:01:54.481]  It's one kilometer.
[02:01:54.481 --> 02:01:55.121]  We'll figure it out.
[02:01:55.121 --> 02:01:55.661]  It doesn't matter.
[02:01:56.581 --> 02:02:01.323]  Why am I off talking about swimming a kilometer?
[02:02:01.323 --> 02:02:05.684]  Okay, we'll figure it out.
[02:02:05.684 --> 02:02:10.606]  Thank you.
[02:02:10.606 --> 02:02:15.027]  All right, let me get refocused here on the news we're covering.
[02:02:15.027 --> 02:02:16.108]  I looked at my sheet wrong.
[02:02:16.108 --> 02:02:20.409]  Greg Palast is coming up in 30 minutes.
[02:02:20.409 --> 02:02:22.510]  And I am still just reeling
[02:02:24.279 --> 02:02:35.843]  Uh, from the fact that illegal aliens rioted all over the United States, set fire to buildings and knocked out more than 20 shop windows, uh, in, um, Santa Cruz.
[02:02:35.843 --> 02:02:40.024]  They're running around with signs all over the news saying they're going to kill citizens, kill police.
[02:02:40.024 --> 02:02:41.785]  We've played audio video of that.
[02:02:41.785 --> 02:02:43.505]  We've shown you the signs.
[02:02:43.505 --> 02:02:44.726]  It's just making my head spin.
[02:02:47.346 --> 02:03:05.300]  When Greg Palast joins us after I take some calls, I'm going to get into Greece gets $146 billion bailout rescue in EU IMF package and how that dovetails in with ECB president, European Central Bank president, favors global governance.
[02:03:05.300 --> 02:03:06.681]  That's Forbes.
[02:03:06.681 --> 02:03:07.902]  And there's another one.
[02:03:07.902 --> 02:03:11.585]  For nations living the good life, the party's over, IMF says.
[02:03:11.585 --> 02:03:15.167]  See, the bankers say your good life is over.
[02:03:15.167 --> 02:03:17.029]  And they're selling you that it's your fault.
[02:03:18.826 --> 02:03:24.928]  Also, Greece erupts as men from IMF prepare to wield an axe and take their pension funds.
[02:03:24.928 --> 02:03:26.908]  The Times of London.
[02:03:26.908 --> 02:03:33.690]  And I heard CNN yesterday explaining how Greece deserves to have their pension funds taken and how they're the bad guys.
[02:03:33.690 --> 02:03:38.591]  Sure, the governments have been bought off, the public have made bad decisions, but
[02:03:40.367 --> 02:03:46.531]  Ninety-five percent, we've had economists on that agree, of what happened here with the mortgage crisis.
[02:03:46.531 --> 02:03:49.313]  Wasn't mortgage crisis, it was derivatives, period.
[02:03:49.313 --> 02:04:00.620]  The media just claimed, oh my gosh, we've got a big housing crisis, we've got a big problem, we've got to have trillions of dollars right now on October 3rd, or we're going to have a depression.
[02:04:00.620 --> 02:04:05.844]  And then October 4th, Henry Paulson, former Goldman Sachs head, he was Treasury Secretary at the time,
[02:04:07.060 --> 02:04:16.084]  said we're not going to tell you where the money's going now and it's not going to unfreeze the mortgage market and the mortgage market is now for is more frozen now that it was then.
[02:04:16.084 --> 02:04:34.833]  So I'm going to explain how this scam works in detail and then coming up the next hour and you guys make me do this remind me because we did a lot of work you did a lot of work getting clips out of Obama's commencement speech in Michigan and his White House press corps dinner where he just went over the top
[02:04:36.155 --> 02:04:43.824]  Over the top with arrogance and in-your-face bravado, chutzpah, whatever you want to call it, hubris.
[02:04:43.824 --> 02:04:48.649]  That is coming up in the last hour amongst a lot of other important news.
[02:04:48.649 --> 02:04:52.273]  But your phone calls are coming up.
[02:04:52.273 --> 02:04:57.098]  Then I'm going to get into this Orwellian IRS ad that's running.
[02:04:57.098 --> 02:04:57.499]  Stay with us.
[02:05:00.754 --> 02:05:03.076]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:05:03.076 --> 02:05:05.459]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:05:05.459 --> 02:05:08.662]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:05:08.662 --> 02:05:13.787]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:05:13.787 --> 02:05:17.971]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:05:18.271 --> 02:05:20.754]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:05:20.754 --> 02:05:23.517]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:05:23.517 --> 02:05:26.420]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:05:26.420 --> 02:05:34.029]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:05:34.372 --> 02:05:39.755]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:05:39.755 --> 02:05:42.597]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:05:42.597 --> 02:05:46.299]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:05:46.299 --> 02:05:47.360]  And I got news for you.
[02:05:47.360 --> 02:05:48.701]  You're everyone else.
[02:05:48.701 --> 02:05:50.202]  Invisible Empire.

[02:07:00.885 --> 02:07:03.908]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:07:03.908 --> 02:07:09.234]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:07:09.234 --> 02:07:11.276]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:07:11.276 --> 02:07:16.282]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:07:16.282 --> 02:07:17.463]  How much do you want?
[02:07:17.463 --> 02:07:18.204]  When do you want it?
[02:07:18.584 --> 02:07:20.464]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:07:20.464 --> 02:07:21.545]  When will you need it?
[02:07:21.545 --> 02:07:23.725]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:07:23.725 --> 02:07:25.066]  Will there be any food?
[02:07:25.066 --> 02:07:26.606]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:07:26.606 --> 02:07:31.867]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:07:31.867 --> 02:07:35.448]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:07:35.448 --> 02:07:38.909]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:07:39.269 --> 02:07:40.490]  How much will you need?
[02:07:40.490 --> 02:07:41.411]  We don't know.
[02:07:41.411 --> 02:07:42.512]  How much do you want?
[02:07:42.512 --> 02:07:43.433]  All you can get.
[02:07:43.433 --> 02:07:44.534]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:07:44.534 --> 02:07:47.576]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:07:47.576 --> 02:07:49.778]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:07:49.778 --> 02:07:50.779]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:08:02.583 --> 02:08:09.214]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:09.214 --> 02:08:13.401]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:13.401 --> 02:08:15.725]  Okay, I'm gonna go back to your calls here in a few minutes.
[02:08:17.793 --> 02:08:36.405]  Then I am going to be interviewing for 30 minutes Greg Palast of the BBC who eight years ago exposed the derivative scam operation that Enron and Goldman Sachs and others had already set up and how they were planning to bring down the Western world just as they had brought down countless third world countries.
[02:08:36.405 --> 02:08:41.508]  He got the internal IMF World Bank documents so we thought it'd be a good time to have Greg Palast back.
[02:08:42.463 --> 02:09:02.573]  Okay, everything the government does is about intimidation and setting up the system where the government's our mommy, our daddy, our big brother, with the billboards, with the fear, with the TV ads about tattling on your parents, tattling on your neighbors, terrorists are under every table.
[02:09:03.479 --> 02:09:05.041]  They're going to get you.
[02:09:05.041 --> 02:09:07.684]  We're taking your rights away to keep you safe.
[02:09:07.684 --> 02:09:12.730]  So the message is we're going to protect you, but we're also going to take your guns so you can't protect yourself.
[02:09:14.082 --> 02:09:32.567]  And we want to intimidate you with the cameras and the surveillance and the tea parties with riot police and sound cannons at the events and the media claiming anybody that's against the banking takeover or open borders is a terrorist and the media covering up illegal aliens rioting nationwide.
[02:09:32.567 --> 02:09:36.248]  And remember this article from Fox News two years ago.
[02:09:36.248 --> 02:09:41.190]  Massachusetts police get black uniforms to instill sense of fear.
[02:09:43.348 --> 02:09:46.249]  Springfield's men in black are returning.
[02:09:46.249 --> 02:09:56.954]  The city's new police commissioner, William Fichette, says members of the department's street crime unit will again don black, military-style uniforms as part of his strategy to deal with youth violence.
[02:09:56.954 --> 02:10:05.358]  And he went on to say, quote, this is, he says, this is the sense of fear has been missing for the past few years.
[02:10:06.258 --> 02:10:06.999]  No, they're not!
[02:10:06.999 --> 02:10:07.619]  We're a republic!
[02:10:29.517 --> 02:10:40.480]  Where if 51% say rob the other 49, you can't because everyone's rights to private property and free speech and the right of defense are protected.
[02:10:40.480 --> 02:10:50.762]  And so when Obama says, oh, the birds are tweeting, the sun's out, it's a beautiful day, the world didn't end when I signed Obamacare.
[02:10:50.762 --> 02:10:54.663]  He knows full well it doesn't get phased in until the next two to five years.
[02:10:54.663 --> 02:10:56.104]  It starts getting phased in in two years.
[02:10:57.014 --> 02:10:58.495]  More deception.
[02:10:58.495 --> 02:11:03.417]  So he comes out and says something similar, very deceptive, using psych warfare.
[02:11:03.417 --> 02:11:05.358]  He comes out and says, you are the government.
[02:11:05.358 --> 02:11:07.980]  So when you criticize the government, you criticize the people.
[02:11:07.980 --> 02:11:08.640]  Really?
[02:11:08.640 --> 02:11:13.603]  Is the government, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan and others being the biggest contributors to both parties?
[02:11:13.603 --> 02:11:16.444]  Offshore banks stealing trillions from us?
[02:11:16.444 --> 02:11:20.867]  That'd be like the Greece government saying, you know, don't criticize the banks, they're your government.
[02:11:20.867 --> 02:11:22.968]  You know, they represent you, this is democracy.
[02:11:25.131 --> 02:11:30.935]  By the way, the Greeks did create democracy, what, 2600 years ago.
[02:11:30.935 --> 02:11:35.278]  They had a bucket for black stones and a bucket for white stones.
[02:11:35.278 --> 02:11:42.543]  And only the land, the landed, wealthy, gentry class was allowed to vote.
[02:11:42.543 --> 02:11:46.786]  A. B, they would have votes almost every day.
[02:11:46.786 --> 02:11:50.169]  And sometimes they would have a vote on, are we going to kill this philosopher?
[02:11:51.650 --> 02:11:53.611]  Who's been criticizing the government?
[02:11:53.611 --> 02:11:56.272]  And they would go have a vote, and they'd say, yes, we're going to kill him.
[02:11:56.272 --> 02:11:59.054]  And so they would grab him and throw him off a cliff.
[02:11:59.054 --> 02:12:00.215]  Many famous cases of that.
[02:12:00.215 --> 02:12:07.879]  Their favorite way to kill someone was to throw them off a 700-foot cliff.
[02:12:07.879 --> 02:12:08.999]  That's how they did it.
[02:12:08.999 --> 02:12:12.721]  Throwing people off, head first, you grab them by their arms and legs, four men, one
[02:12:14.580 --> 02:12:17.622]  One, two, three!
[02:12:17.622 --> 02:12:19.063]  I'm not for democracy.
[02:12:19.063 --> 02:12:20.724]  I'm against democracy.
[02:12:20.724 --> 02:12:22.886]  I'm sick of hearing about democracy.
[02:12:22.886 --> 02:12:31.452]  In a democracy, they can bring in 51% foreigners from China and Germany and Europe and Mexico and everywhere else.
[02:12:31.452 --> 02:12:32.973]  They can bring them in.
[02:12:32.973 --> 02:12:39.057]  The government promises them in a political party some chicken feed goodies if they'll vote for big government and tyranny.
[02:12:39.057 --> 02:12:41.379]  They vote for it and they say, hey, 51% voted to take your guns.
[02:12:44.701 --> 02:12:48.264]  You notice, though, the government likes democracy when it goes their way.
[02:12:48.264 --> 02:12:55.729]  But when 65-70% of Americans are against abortion now, they say, oh, well, we're a republic.
[02:12:55.729 --> 02:13:01.333]  Doesn't matter if 99% of you are against abortion, people can still do what they want with their body.
[02:13:01.333 --> 02:13:02.994]  But that's another case.
[02:13:02.994 --> 02:13:07.798]  In a republic, everyone's rights are protected, including that baby that can't speak for itself.
[02:13:07.798 --> 02:13:09.739]  But that's a twisting of the republic.
[02:13:09.739 --> 02:13:12.841]  So, see, they want to play it both ways here.
[02:13:12.841 --> 02:13:13.742]  Now, that said,
[02:13:15.472 --> 02:13:18.894]  We have seen massive, sustained intimidation of the people.
[02:13:18.894 --> 02:13:28.641]  All over the country, the police admit we wear black uniforms, we wear black masks, we beat on our shields with billy clubs, we bring sound cannons out to the tea parties to intimidate you.
[02:13:29.932 --> 02:13:32.254]  Because we want to intimidate you.
[02:13:32.254 --> 02:13:45.886]  That's why they bring riot police to any pro-America demonstration, whether it's anti-war, that's pro-sovereignty, that's good, or whether it's pro-border control, or whether it's pro-Second Amendment, or pro-land rights.
[02:13:45.886 --> 02:13:55.374]  If the globalists don't like it, they don't want demonstrations to spread, they don't want the idea to spread, they want to keep... In fact, pull up that ants clip again.
[02:13:56.385 --> 02:13:57.545]  We never played that last week.
[02:13:57.545 --> 02:13:59.846]  If you let one ant stand up, they'll all stand up.
[02:13:59.846 --> 02:14:03.507]  Do we have that?
[02:14:03.507 --> 02:14:05.627]  Okay, yeah, I think you were actually gone.
[02:14:05.627 --> 02:14:07.128]  Yeah, no, we have the clip.
[02:14:07.128 --> 02:14:08.268]  We'll cue that up.
[02:14:08.268 --> 02:14:09.568]  In fact, John has it.
[02:14:09.568 --> 02:14:13.289]  John, you have that at the network, don't you?
[02:14:13.289 --> 02:14:14.309]  You couldn't find it either.
[02:14:14.309 --> 02:14:16.550]  Okay, well, we'll have to go buy it then.
[02:14:16.550 --> 02:14:19.390]  The point is, it's about a 10-second clip.
[02:14:19.390 --> 02:14:25.632]  The issue is, you've got the grasshoppers all standing around, and they're in this big granary,
[02:14:26.912 --> 02:14:39.022]  Totally stuffed, gobbling, and the second-in-command aid-to-camp grasshopper comes shuffling over to the boss grasshopper, and he says, why are we fighting with these ants?
[02:14:39.022 --> 02:14:40.623]  We don't need them to work for us.
[02:14:40.623 --> 02:14:42.624]  We got plenty of food here.
[02:14:42.624 --> 02:14:51.731]  And the head grasshopper says, those puny little ants outnumber us 100 to 1, and if they ever figure that out, it's over for us.
[02:14:52.972 --> 02:14:54.913]  It's not about food, it's about power.
[02:14:54.913 --> 02:14:57.154]  It's about letting them know we're in charge.
[02:14:57.154 --> 02:14:57.754]  And here it is.
[02:14:57.754 --> 02:15:02.936]  Massachusetts police get black uniforms to instill a sense of fear.
[02:15:02.936 --> 02:15:04.957]  Now that's what this is all about.
[02:15:04.957 --> 02:15:16.482]  And the video we're about to play that's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com Orwellian Big Brother Tax Collection commercial airs in Pennsylvania.
[02:15:16.482 --> 02:15:19.064]  And there are so many facets to this.
[02:15:19.064 --> 02:15:21.485]  I even wrote some notes last night that I want to go over here.
[02:15:22.435 --> 02:15:29.698]  There are so many levels to this, but let's play the 30 second ad first and then go over what the message here.
[02:15:29.698 --> 02:15:32.159]  The message is we're watching you from satellite.
[02:15:32.159 --> 02:15:33.140]  We're God.
[02:15:33.140 --> 02:15:34.800]  We know who you are.
[02:15:34.800 --> 02:15:37.281]  We're going to drive you into bankruptcy.
[02:15:37.281 --> 02:15:38.402]  We're never going to stop.
[02:15:39.022 --> 02:15:42.924]  And we're going to say it with a calm, authoritative, arrogant voice.
[02:15:42.924 --> 02:15:44.604]  Nice car, Tom.
[02:15:44.604 --> 02:15:46.085]  Nice house, Tom.
[02:15:46.085 --> 02:15:48.646]  What's not nice is you not paying.
[02:15:48.646 --> 02:15:50.107]  You're not nice, Tom.
[02:15:50.107 --> 02:15:51.547]  You're the enemy, Tom.
[02:15:51.547 --> 02:15:58.210]  This is meant to scare the public and to brainwash government employees more and more as an us-against-them mentality.
[02:15:58.210 --> 02:15:59.070]  This is right out of 1984.
[02:15:59.070 --> 02:15:59.310]  Here it is.
[02:16:00.876 --> 02:16:02.156]  Your name is Tom.
[02:16:02.156 --> 02:16:04.197]  You live just off of 5th Street.
[02:16:04.197 --> 02:16:05.437]  Nice car, Tom.
[02:16:05.437 --> 02:16:06.338]  Nice house.
[02:16:06.338 --> 02:16:13.019]  What's not so nice is you owe Pennsylvania $4,212 in back taxes.
[02:16:13.019 --> 02:16:14.200]  Listen, Tom.
[02:16:14.200 --> 02:16:15.800]  We can make this easy.
[02:16:15.800 --> 02:16:22.242]  Pay online by June 18th and we'll skip your penalty and take half off your interest.
[02:16:22.242 --> 02:16:25.623]  Because, Tom, we do know who you are.
[02:16:25.623 --> 02:16:29.384]  Find us before we find you.
[02:16:31.598 --> 02:16:32.579]  That's what the mafia does.
[02:16:32.579 --> 02:16:39.305]  They come up and say, nice cleaners, nice furniture store, nice family grocery store.
[02:16:39.305 --> 02:16:41.307]  We'll make this easy for you, Tom.
[02:16:41.307 --> 02:16:45.751]  Pay us and we won't burn your grocery store down.
[02:16:45.751 --> 02:16:51.517]  And now you have the Greek people being told you are going to have to pay
[02:16:52.884 --> 02:16:55.406]  At least half of your pension fund money to begin with.
[02:16:55.406 --> 02:16:57.587]  We're going to make this easy on you, Grace.
[02:16:57.587 --> 02:17:05.812]  Only half your money has to be paid to JPMorgan, Chase, and Goldman Sachs that run your country as their finance minister.
[02:17:05.812 --> 02:17:07.013]  You don't owe the money.
[02:17:07.013 --> 02:17:07.914]  It's pure derivatives.
[02:17:07.914 --> 02:17:08.894]  It's made up.
[02:17:08.894 --> 02:17:09.815]  Came out on Iceland.
[02:17:09.815 --> 02:17:10.775]  They said no.
[02:17:10.775 --> 02:17:13.357]  Turned out it was totally fraudulent.
[02:17:13.357 --> 02:17:15.738]  Same thing here in the US.
[02:17:15.738 --> 02:17:17.500]  But we're going to be easy on you, Tom.
[02:17:18.527 --> 02:17:23.550]  You know, Tom, we already poisoned your water with fluoride that doubles your chances of bone cancer and brain damage.
[02:17:23.550 --> 02:17:28.052]  You know, Tom, we're already pushing mandatory vaccinations filled with mercury, Tom.
[02:17:28.052 --> 02:17:32.455]  You know, Tom, we're watching you with all these cameras and satellites, Tom.
[02:17:32.455 --> 02:17:33.675]  You know, we're omnipresent.
[02:17:33.675 --> 02:17:34.936]  We're God, Tom.
[02:17:34.936 --> 02:17:36.077]  We're the Borg.
[02:17:36.077 --> 02:17:37.497]  We're the hive mind.
[02:17:37.497 --> 02:17:39.018]  We own you, Tom.
[02:17:39.018 --> 02:17:41.119]  You need to submit to us, Tom.
[02:17:41.119 --> 02:17:44.641]  You need to do what you're told, Tom.
[02:17:44.641 --> 02:17:47.523]  Play that sickening 30-second clip.
[02:17:48.712 --> 02:17:50.113]  Oh, we now have the ants clip.
[02:17:50.113 --> 02:17:51.133]  That's fine.
[02:17:51.133 --> 02:17:52.774]  Let's go ahead and play the ants clip.
[02:17:52.774 --> 02:17:55.856]  Here it is.
[02:17:55.856 --> 02:17:58.997]  But there was that ant that stood up to me.
[02:17:58.997 --> 02:18:00.958]  Yeah, but we can forget about him.
[02:18:00.958 --> 02:18:03.319]  Yeah, it was just one ant.
[02:18:03.319 --> 02:18:05.601]  Ooh, one ant.
[02:18:05.601 --> 02:18:06.861]  Yeah, you're right.
[02:18:06.861 --> 02:18:08.302]  It's just one ant.
[02:18:08.302 --> 02:18:10.023]  Yeah, boss.
[02:18:10.023 --> 02:18:11.504]  They're puny.
[02:18:11.504 --> 02:18:13.364]  Hmm, puny?
[02:18:13.364 --> 02:18:17.527]  Say, let's pretend this brain is a puny little ant.
[02:18:18.789 --> 02:18:20.253]  Did that hurt?
[02:18:20.253 --> 02:18:20.934]  Nope.
[02:18:20.934 --> 02:18:22.999]  Well, how about this one?
[02:18:22.999 --> 02:18:23.901]  Are you kidding?
[02:18:23.901 --> 02:18:26.607]  Well, how about this?
[02:18:39.224 --> 02:18:45.106]  You let one ant stand up to us, then they all might stand up.
[02:18:45.106 --> 02:18:49.888]  Those puny little ants outnumber us a hundred to one.
[02:18:49.888 --> 02:18:54.549]  And if they ever figure that out, there goes our way of life!
[02:18:54.549 --> 02:18:56.470]  It's not about food.
[02:18:56.470 --> 02:18:59.811]  It's about keeping those ants in line.
[02:18:59.811 --> 02:19:02.692]  That's why we're going back!
[02:19:02.692 --> 02:19:04.353]  Does anybody else want to stay?
[02:19:15.151 --> 02:19:15.952]  And that's it.
[02:19:15.952 --> 02:19:17.613]  That's government.
[02:19:17.613 --> 02:19:19.734]  That's what the Founding Fathers warned us about.
[02:19:19.734 --> 02:19:21.756]  That's what's happened to every other civilization.
[02:19:21.756 --> 02:19:29.402]  And now the average American pays more than 60% of their earnings in one form of taxation or another.
[02:19:29.402 --> 02:19:33.585]  And they've got the head grasshopper, the head of the European Central Bank,
[02:19:35.459 --> 02:19:44.886]  In the Washington Post, it says, for nations living the good life, the party is over, IMF chief says.
[02:19:44.886 --> 02:19:53.332]  And on the same board, the head of the European Central Bank says, global government is going to be set up to keep us in line.
[02:19:53.332 --> 02:19:54.793]  You hear that, Tom?
[02:19:54.793 --> 02:19:56.314]  We own you, Tom.
[02:19:56.314 --> 02:19:58.195]  You're our slave, Tom.
[02:19:58.195 --> 02:19:59.216]  You understand, Tom?
[02:20:01.957 --> 02:20:03.198]  Global meltdowns.
[02:20:03.198 --> 02:20:04.619]  Massive unemployment.
[02:20:04.619 --> 02:20:05.820]  Endless wars.
[02:20:05.820 --> 02:20:07.481]  A new currency crisis.
[02:20:07.481 --> 02:20:09.562]  Financially and morally bankrupt.
[02:20:09.562 --> 02:20:11.704]  A great and terrible storm is approaching.
[02:20:11.704 --> 02:20:13.605]  So what's the best way to get ready?
[02:20:13.605 --> 02:20:15.686]  To get prepared for hard times ahead.
[02:20:15.686 --> 02:20:17.688]  Introducing Off The Grid News.

[02:21:01.280 --> 02:21:04.804]  Jim Newcomer with Midas Resources, talking today about change.
[02:21:04.804 --> 02:21:10.210]  Not the change we were promised by President Obama, but the reality that we must face in these changing economic times.
[02:21:10.210 --> 02:21:15.576]  With our national debt currently exceeding $12.5 trillion, and our unfunded liabilities totaling over $107 trillion,
[02:21:16.957 --> 02:21:17.818]  The value of the U.S.
[02:21:17.818 --> 02:21:19.940]  dollar continues its slide into oblivion.
[02:21:19.940 --> 02:21:23.104]  There's still time to ensure your financial security with precious metals.
[02:21:23.104 --> 02:21:24.626]  But you need to act today.
[02:21:24.626 --> 02:21:33.796]  Call me, Jim Newcomer, at 800-686-2237, extension 104, and we can explore how MIDAS resources can help you secure your financial future.
[02:21:33.796 --> 02:21:38.421]  With our government continuing to find new ways to spend our money at the expense of our children and grandchildren,
[02:21:38.621 --> 02:21:42.265]  There's still time to acquire a true hedge against inflation with Precious Metals.
[02:21:42.265 --> 02:21:54.736]  Call me, Jim Newcomer, at 800-686-2237, extension 104, and we'll discuss how you can take physical possession or convert your IRA into Precious Metals before it's too late.
[02:21:54.736 --> 02:22:00.642]  800-686-2237, extension 104, and make the commitment today to retain the security you worked a lifetime to establish.
[02:22:03.331 --> 02:22:05.813]  And you're subject to other police action.
[02:22:05.813 --> 02:22:07.075]  Tyranny is here.
[02:22:07.075 --> 02:22:10.878]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:22:10.878 --> 02:22:13.240]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:22:13.240 --> 02:22:18.405]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:22:19.974 --> 02:22:25.757]  Exclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:22:25.757 --> 02:22:31.720]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:22:31.720 --> 02:22:35.942]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[02:22:35.942 --> 02:22:40.224]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:22:40.224 --> 02:22:46.166]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:22:46.166 --> 02:22:49.068]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:22:49.708 --> 02:22:51.691]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:22:51.691 --> 02:22:52.812]  It's here.

[02:23:01.118 --> 02:23:02.038]  You worry.
[02:23:02.038 --> 02:23:04.059]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[02:23:04.059 --> 02:23:06.600]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[02:23:06.600 --> 02:23:08.700]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[02:23:08.700 --> 02:23:10.301]  Your answer may be at hand.
[02:23:10.301 --> 02:23:13.902]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[02:23:13.902 --> 02:23:19.124]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[02:23:19.124 --> 02:23:22.445]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[02:23:22.930 --> 02:23:24.611]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[02:23:24.611 --> 02:23:27.473]  Wild food grows everywhere, and you will see it everywhere.
[02:23:27.473 --> 02:23:30.795]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[02:23:30.795 --> 02:23:39.241]  Well-respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[02:23:39.241 --> 02:23:43.924]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.

[02:24:00.580 --> 02:24:01.861]  Your name is Tom.
[02:24:01.861 --> 02:24:03.882]  You live just off of 5th Street.
[02:24:03.882 --> 02:24:05.143]  Nice car, Tom.
[02:24:05.143 --> 02:24:06.044]  Nice house.
[02:24:06.044 --> 02:24:12.728]  What's not so nice is you owe Pennsylvania $4,212 in back taxes.
[02:24:12.728 --> 02:24:15.510]  Listen, Tom, we can make this easy.
[02:24:15.510 --> 02:24:21.954]  Pay online by June 18th, and we'll skip your penalty and take half off your interest.
[02:24:21.954 --> 02:24:25.257]  Because, Tom, we do know who you are.
[02:24:29.994 --> 02:24:32.155]  We know who you are, Tom.
[02:24:32.155 --> 02:24:39.156]  The illegal aliens are above the law, don't have to pay taxes, get all the free welfare, because we're bringing them in here as a voting block.
[02:24:39.156 --> 02:24:40.156]  You're the enemy, Tom.
[02:24:40.156 --> 02:24:43.677]  We're running an offshore military banking operation against you.
[02:24:43.677 --> 02:24:44.918]  We run your country.
[02:24:44.918 --> 02:24:47.158]  You're not living in a free nation anymore, Tom.
[02:24:47.158 --> 02:24:52.959]  We're watching you with satellites and tracking systems with your own money.
[02:24:52.959 --> 02:24:54.580]  We're going to bankrupt you, Tom.
[02:24:55.814 --> 02:24:56.634]  You understand, Tom?
[02:24:56.634 --> 02:24:57.634]  You got a nice house.
[02:24:57.634 --> 02:24:58.955]  You got a nice car.
[02:24:58.955 --> 02:24:59.935]  That's one step away from you.
[02:24:59.935 --> 02:25:01.375]  You got nice kids.
[02:25:01.375 --> 02:25:05.096]  Hope nothing happens to them, Tom.
[02:25:05.096 --> 02:25:06.357]  That's the intimidation.
[02:25:06.357 --> 02:25:10.137]  That's the type of mind control and bullying we have.
[02:25:10.137 --> 02:25:11.058]  And the sky's the limit.
[02:25:11.058 --> 02:25:13.498]  Have you seen the armed camp the government's become?
[02:25:13.498 --> 02:25:20.380]  They run Fox News pieces now admitting our government's growing the opium in Afghanistan, but they're going to arrest you if you get caught with it.
[02:25:21.573 --> 02:25:24.455]  Of course they gotta keep it illegal to keep the price up!
[02:25:24.455 --> 02:25:26.096]  They're drug dealers!
[02:25:26.096 --> 02:25:29.218]  How many drug dealers did we interview for Kevin Booth's new film?
[02:25:29.218 --> 02:25:31.059]  Part 2 of American Drug War.
[02:25:31.059 --> 02:25:32.180]  We'd won the West.
[02:25:32.180 --> 02:25:37.063]  The drug dealers, both government and local, don't want drugs decriminalized.
[02:25:37.063 --> 02:25:39.504]  Because they're drug dealers, Tom.
[02:25:39.504 --> 02:25:43.947]  Tom is the new Winston Smith in this Orwellian system.
[02:25:43.947 --> 02:25:45.848]  And that's the government's mentality.
[02:25:45.848 --> 02:25:46.949]  Intimidate them.
[02:25:46.949 --> 02:25:48.050]  Drive them into submission.
[02:25:49.360 --> 02:26:04.586]  I don't know how many people I know that have degrees who lost their job at a nice company and now bag groceries and even pick up another job and have moved into a smaller house and can't pay for anything and they can't pay.
[02:26:04.586 --> 02:26:07.387]  I mean a small house in Austin has like a $5,000 a year property tax.
[02:26:11.670 --> 02:26:14.012]  And I heard him announce last week where I live.
[02:26:14.012 --> 02:26:17.934]  Well, it doesn't matter if property tax receipts are down because home values are down.
[02:26:17.934 --> 02:26:19.515]  We're just going to raise them.
[02:26:19.515 --> 02:26:24.258]  And we don't care if we're going to double in the next three years your power bill.
[02:26:24.258 --> 02:26:29.322]  And we're just going to keep expanding and taking the money through the comprehensive annual financial reports.
[02:26:29.322 --> 02:26:31.783]  And we're going to invest it with the big banks.
[02:26:31.783 --> 02:26:33.004]  And that's just the way it is.
[02:26:33.004 --> 02:26:33.805]  Do you understand?
[02:26:34.725 --> 02:26:39.628]  As the arrogant head of the IMF came out and said, the good times are over.
[02:26:39.628 --> 02:26:41.209]  You're going to be poor now.
[02:26:41.209 --> 02:26:43.490]  And we want you to lose your house, Tom.
[02:26:43.490 --> 02:26:45.131]  We want the government.
[02:26:45.131 --> 02:26:46.712]  I'll never forget Nelda Wells Spears.
[02:26:46.712 --> 02:26:47.632]  This was a decade ago.
[02:26:47.632 --> 02:26:52.075]  Mike Hanson ought to find that video from our AXS TV days and upload it to the web.
[02:26:53.658 --> 02:26:56.803]  I think it's Alex Jones Confronts County Tax Assessor.
[02:26:56.803 --> 02:27:00.708]  And she says, Nelda Wells Spears, she says, we don't take houses!
[02:27:00.708 --> 02:27:06.296]  And then we cut to the courthouse, them selling houses, in some cases for $2,000 property tax bills they couldn't pay.
[02:27:07.318 --> 02:27:09.399]  And she says, we do not take homes.
[02:27:09.399 --> 02:27:10.899]  Then we cut to them taking the homes.
[02:27:10.899 --> 02:27:16.441]  And then we cut to her in Commissioner's Court a month before, talking about all the great houses they'd taken for sale.
[02:27:16.441 --> 02:27:17.641]  But that's their arrogance.
[02:27:17.641 --> 02:27:25.084]  She's talking to an enemy, a slave enemy, and she's gonna do nothing but sit there and stonewall and say, no.
[02:27:25.084 --> 02:27:26.304]  Hey, I don't want world government.
[02:27:26.304 --> 02:27:27.885]  I don't want trillions going to bankers.
[02:27:27.885 --> 02:27:29.025]  World government doesn't exist.
[02:27:29.025 --> 02:27:30.326]  Bankers don't exist.
[02:27:30.326 --> 02:27:31.306]  I don't want a new world order.
[02:27:31.306 --> 02:27:32.266]  It doesn't exist.
[02:27:32.266 --> 02:27:34.207]  I don't want them taking people's houses.
[02:27:34.207 --> 02:27:35.848]  We can't pay the taxes anymore.
[02:27:35.848 --> 02:27:36.768]  Government's too big.
[02:27:37.964 --> 02:27:40.366]  We're not taking houses.
[02:27:40.366 --> 02:27:41.687]  We're not.
[02:27:41.687 --> 02:27:44.709]  Nice car, nice house, Tom.
[02:27:44.709 --> 02:27:48.531]  Nice kids, Tom.
[02:27:48.531 --> 02:27:50.613]  I'm going to cover this more in the last hour if I have time.
[02:27:50.613 --> 02:27:51.553]  Greg Palast is coming up.
[02:27:51.553 --> 02:27:54.095]  I need to go to your calls and a bunch of other news we haven't gotten to yet.
[02:27:54.095 --> 02:27:55.156]  We're doing a pretty good job today.
[02:27:56.141 --> 02:27:57.082]  Covering it all.
[02:27:57.082 --> 02:27:59.764]  But this is government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:27:59.764 --> 02:28:04.307]  This is psychological bullying and mafia terrorism against the people.
[02:28:04.307 --> 02:28:10.191]  Before we go to break, I just hope this outrages you like it outrages me and let the scum in government know that we're aware of what they're doing.
[02:28:11.038 --> 02:28:13.260]  And the illegal alien hordes that work for him.
[02:28:13.260 --> 02:28:18.284]  Before I go to break, I want to thank some of the sponsors that have made today's radio show possible.
[02:28:18.284 --> 02:28:20.926]  Number one is Pure Water Freedom.
[02:28:20.926 --> 02:28:27.431]  You talk about the best prices I've found on in-home and also off the shelf and on the counter.
[02:28:27.431 --> 02:28:28.352]  They've got it all.
[02:28:28.352 --> 02:28:30.454]  PureWaterFreedom.com.
[02:28:30.454 --> 02:28:33.716]  If you want to affordably remove fluoride from your tap water, visit Pure Water.
[02:28:34.477 --> 02:28:35.377]  Freedom.com.
[02:28:35.377 --> 02:28:37.157]  It's PureWaterFreedom.com.
[02:28:37.157 --> 02:28:39.438]  They have a full line of household fluoride filters.
[02:28:39.438 --> 02:28:45.459]  You can even remove fluoride from every water source in your home with a whole water fluoride system.
[02:28:45.459 --> 02:28:51.540]  They have a wide variety of filters to remove all types of toxins from your water, including shower and bath filters.
[02:28:51.540 --> 02:28:53.720]  All their filters are made in the USA.
[02:28:53.720 --> 02:29:00.501]  Check out their banners on PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or go to PureWaterFreedom.com.
[02:29:00.501 --> 02:29:02.682]  And then I want to thank another fabulous sponsor.
[02:29:02.682 --> 02:29:03.722]  You cannot trust
[02:29:05.097 --> 02:29:05.437]  We're good to go.
[02:29:23.661 --> 02:29:26.644]  I've got to tell you, there's a lot of bad folks out there selling food.
[02:29:26.644 --> 02:29:28.906]  efoodsdirect.com are wonderful people.
[02:29:28.906 --> 02:29:42.078]  E, the letter E, foodsdirect.com, or give them a call, ask for a free info brochure, 800-409-5633, 800-409-5633, or again, check them out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:29:42.078 --> 02:29:47.223]  You'll never stand in a bread line with the big fat government pimps over you if you have your own bread.
[02:29:47.223 --> 02:29:48.664]  We'll be right back with Greg Palast.
[02:29:48.664 --> 02:29:49.125]  Stay with us.
[02:29:51.485 --> 02:29:55.415]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.415 --> 02:29:58.081]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.093 --> 02:30:10.579]  With the implementation of Codex Alimentarius, it is clear that we must act quickly to avoid losing our freedom of choice where personal health preferences are concerned.
[02:30:10.579 --> 02:30:21.486]  As of January 1, 2010, Codex Alimentarius was implemented within the European Union, resulting in the restricted sale of many natural supplements, including colloidal silver.
[02:30:21.486 --> 02:30:26.910]  We must take immediate steps to assure a continuing supply of colloidal silver for ourselves and our families.
[02:30:27.470 --> 02:30:32.353]  Act now to acquire the means of producing this beneficial supplement in the privacy of your own home.
[02:30:32.353 --> 02:30:41.419]  Colloidal Silver is a powerful antipathogenic used for more than 200 years as a natural alternative to costly drugs and their dangerous, unpredictable side effects.
[02:30:41.419 --> 02:30:51.526]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com for more information on how to secure your freedom of choice by producing your own Colloidal Silver right from home.
[02:30:51.526 --> 02:30:56.209]  That's www.SilverLungs.com SilverLungs.com
[02:31:00.774 --> 02:31:02.075]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:31:02.075 --> 02:31:07.660]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:31:07.660 --> 02:31:12.686]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:31:12.686 --> 02:31:17.711]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:31:18.251 --> 02:31:23.475]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:31:23.475 --> 02:31:25.776]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[02:31:25.776 --> 02:31:30.579]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:31:30.579 --> 02:31:31.700]  And here's the best part.
[02:31:31.700 --> 02:31:34.782]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:31:34.782 --> 02:31:38.385]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:31:38.385 --> 02:31:41.587]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:31:41.587 --> 02:31:43.808]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:31:43.808 --> 02:31:44.729]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:31:48.371 --> 02:31:51.332]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:31:51.332 --> 02:31:57.433]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:31:57.433 --> 02:32:00.854]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:32:00.854 --> 02:32:07.516]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:32:07.516 --> 02:32:12.637]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:32:12.637 --> 02:32:14.498]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[02:32:16.724 --> 02:32:21.369]  Well, they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:32:21.369 --> 02:32:25.454]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[02:32:25.454 --> 02:32:28.898]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[02:32:28.898 --> 02:32:34.464]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[02:32:34.464 --> 02:32:37.548]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[02:32:39.529 --> 02:32:41.672]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:32:41.672 --> 02:32:43.474]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:32:43.474 --> 02:32:46.357]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:32:46.357 --> 02:32:52.984]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[02:32:52.984 --> 02:32:55.687]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[02:32:55.687 --> 02:32:58.049]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[02:32:58.049 --> 02:32:58.930]  Others don't.
[02:33:11.772 --> 02:33:17.501]  Coming up in the next hour, I'm going to play clips from two different Obama speeches.
[02:33:17.501 --> 02:33:23.950]  One at the White House Correspondents' Dinner, where he was extremely arrogant and made jokes about the private banking takeover of the United States.
[02:33:25.239 --> 02:33:38.946]  And another where he demonized the Tea Party folks, who have been bipartisan, but the Republicans are trying to take it over with the Tea Party Express, and said that basically you don't criticize the government in America because the government is the people.
[02:33:38.946 --> 02:33:39.886]  No, it's not.
[02:33:39.886 --> 02:33:41.887]  It's foreign offshore banks.
[02:33:41.887 --> 02:33:43.068]  The same people that own
[02:33:43.968 --> 02:33:46.369]  Barack Obama owned George W. Bush.
[02:33:46.369 --> 02:33:51.992]  Now the reason I got this fellow on is because he's written multiple books and made films on the subject.
[02:33:51.992 --> 02:33:55.654]  He's worked for ABC News, the BBC, the list goes on and on.
[02:33:56.991 --> 02:33:58.512]  Palace stories bite.
[02:33:58.512 --> 02:34:01.194]  They're so relevant, they threaten to alter history.
[02:34:01.194 --> 02:34:04.336]  Palace is exactly what a journalist is supposed to be.
[02:34:04.336 --> 02:34:05.877]  A truth hound.
[02:34:05.877 --> 02:34:07.758]  Doggedly independent.
[02:34:07.758 --> 02:34:09.520]  Undaunted by power.
[02:34:09.520 --> 02:34:13.462]  And remember a few years ago, they issued a Homeland Security arrest warrant for him.
[02:34:13.462 --> 02:34:15.184]  That was on ABC News.
[02:34:15.184 --> 02:34:17.725]  Because he went and videotaped FEMA camps.
[02:34:18.726 --> 02:34:19.086]  We're good to go.
[02:34:40.253 --> 02:34:44.334]  Back in 2002, Greg Palast got IMF World Bank documents.
[02:34:44.334 --> 02:34:54.876]  He came on my show and talked about them, but he reported on it to BBC, where the IMF and others engineer the collapse of societies, get them on debt on purpose.
[02:34:54.876 --> 02:35:01.537]  This predates the information with economic hitmen and John Perkins.
[02:35:01.537 --> 02:35:06.438]  And it showed the predatory nature, how they create riots on purpose, how they jack up prices.
[02:35:06.438 --> 02:35:08.478]  And now they're doing the same thing
[02:35:09.338 --> 02:35:10.939]  to the United States.
[02:35:10.939 --> 02:35:15.802]  And I have the Washington Post, where the head of the IMF last week said, the good times are over.
[02:35:15.802 --> 02:35:17.023]  That's a quote.
[02:35:17.023 --> 02:35:18.364]  Everything's going to go to the bankers.
[02:35:18.364 --> 02:35:25.548]  And in Greece, I heard them on CNN yesterday, I have the Times of London, they were framing the Greeks as bad people.
[02:35:25.548 --> 02:35:30.292]  They get 85% on average for their pensions they pay into through the government.
[02:35:30.292 --> 02:35:32.373]  You know, the Germans only get 45%.
[02:35:32.373 --> 02:35:33.554]  The Germans are mad.
[02:35:33.554 --> 02:35:36.395]  So they're phrasing it as kind of like the housing bubble.
[02:35:36.395 --> 02:35:38.337]  Oh, it's the people that got the loans that are bad.
[02:35:38.857 --> 02:35:42.621]  And then right the day after the Banker Bailout bill,
[02:35:43.667 --> 02:35:44.628]  Glad to be back with you, Alec.
[02:36:13.759 --> 02:36:15.140]  So much is going on.
[02:36:15.140 --> 02:36:19.284]  Break down your take on what's currently happening and where you see it going.
[02:36:19.284 --> 02:36:22.967]  Well, I think that you've got to be pretty darn correct.
[02:36:22.967 --> 02:36:34.276]  I mean, number one, again, you'll see, just like they blame homeowners in America for subprime loans, predatory loans.
[02:36:34.276 --> 02:36:40.281]  You have to understand that most of the... We have a massive foreclosure problem in the United States.
[02:36:40.281 --> 02:36:42.343]  Two million families facing foreclosure.
[02:36:42.904 --> 02:36:43.084]  I don't
[02:37:03.874 --> 02:37:06.055]  Very important that the system is blaming the victim.
[02:37:06.055 --> 02:37:09.157]  In the case of Greece, they're blaming the people of Greece.
[02:37:09.157 --> 02:37:18.342]  How dare they want to collect their social security when they've been manipulated by the bankers because they're tied to the damn euro.
[02:37:18.342 --> 02:37:22.564]  Now, I've actually spoken to the father of the euro, the guy that came up with it, Robert Bundeli.
[02:37:22.564 --> 02:37:23.945]  He was a comic.
[02:37:23.945 --> 02:37:25.406]  The guy who came up with it.
[02:37:25.406 --> 02:37:28.908]  By the way, he's also, his other invention, the euro, is supply-side economics.
[02:37:29.491 --> 02:37:30.091]  We're good to go.
[02:37:47.414 --> 02:37:56.221]  It was about making sure that each nation would no longer have control of its own fiscal fate.
[02:37:56.221 --> 02:38:05.648]  That they would be stuck competing against each other by reducing services provided by the government so that it would keep cheapening your workforce.
[02:38:05.648 --> 02:38:06.869]  And he was very blunt about it.
[02:38:06.869 --> 02:38:08.790]  That's the purpose of it.
[02:38:08.790 --> 02:38:10.171]  It's not to make Europe stronger.
[02:38:10.171 --> 02:38:15.215]  It's to make the nations within Europe impotent.
[02:38:15.215 --> 02:38:16.096]  That was its philosophy.
[02:38:18.311 --> 02:38:20.532]  And that's the same thing with NAFTA and GATT.
[02:38:20.532 --> 02:38:22.012]  Ross Perot was right.
[02:38:22.012 --> 02:38:23.092]  The race to the bottom.
[02:38:23.092 --> 02:38:28.713]  And we got the SPP, North American Union documents, three years ago when Judicial Watch sued and got them.
[02:38:28.713 --> 02:38:39.876]  And they said, they had all these corporate chiefs there at the governmental meeting telling the Secretary of State of Mexico, Canada and the United States what to do.
[02:38:39.876 --> 02:38:43.897]  And they said, we're going to lower the US and Canada to the level of Mexico.
[02:38:44.537 --> 02:38:46.518]  Well I think that what we're seeing too
[02:39:14.600 --> 02:39:24.283]  Is that, you know, when Obama and Bush came up with the bailout, what they didn't do is what China did.
[02:39:24.283 --> 02:39:30.385]  And China, they just said, if we're going to give money to the bank, they've got to re-lend the money.
[02:39:30.385 --> 02:39:37.327]  Remember that Obama made a claim that he saved the financial system.
[02:39:37.327 --> 02:39:37.907]  No, he didn't.
[02:39:37.907 --> 02:39:39.408]  He saved the financiers.
[02:39:39.408 --> 02:39:43.549]  And he doesn't seem to understand there's a difference between financiers who were bailed out
[02:39:44.501 --> 02:39:46.102]  And the financial system.
[02:39:46.102 --> 02:39:47.082]  Try to get a loan today.
[02:39:47.082 --> 02:39:48.803]  Try to get a mortgage today.
[02:39:48.803 --> 02:39:49.604]  You can't.
[02:39:49.604 --> 02:39:51.825]  If you're a small business, you can't borrow money today.
[02:39:51.825 --> 02:39:52.865]  It's impossible.
[02:39:52.865 --> 02:39:54.166]  No one will give you money.
[02:39:54.166 --> 02:39:55.987]  There's no credit in the system.
[02:39:55.987 --> 02:40:01.669]  That's why we're on our knees, and that's why there's officially still nearly 10% unemployment.
[02:40:01.669 --> 02:40:04.050]  Forget the unofficial numbers.
[02:40:04.050 --> 02:40:10.193]  And because Obama never saved the financial system whatsoever.
[02:40:10.193 --> 02:40:13.515]  They kept them, which you'd have to have as capital in a capitalist system,
[02:40:14.198 --> 02:40:16.179]  And the money went to the banks and never came out.
[02:40:16.179 --> 02:40:21.123]  They swallowed it and it was gone, and bonuses and building up their own capital base.
[02:40:21.123 --> 02:40:22.824]  That's the big problem.
[02:40:22.824 --> 02:40:37.194]  So, whereas China grew 8% last year because they doubled the amount of credit in their economy, and so that people could buy up all the junk that they were going to sell us at Walmart, the Chinese bought it for themselves because they're, you know, the bank, they're the bankers.
[02:40:37.194 --> 02:40:41.257]  If they don't give out the money, they execute them, which is a pretty good system of regulation, in my opinion.
[02:40:43.608 --> 02:40:46.770]  Let me boil that down and see if you agree.
[02:40:57.298 --> 02:40:59.578]  Paulson goes in and threatens martial law.
[02:40:59.578 --> 02:41:02.459]  I've had the congressman on who witnessed it.
[02:41:02.459 --> 02:41:09.961]  He says, there'll be blood in the streets, that's a quote, everything will collapse if you don't give us access to trillions of dollars in a blank check.
[02:41:09.961 --> 02:41:17.382]  October 3rd it passes, but before that they wouldn't pass it so they went, they had the bank heads go out and bad mouth the stock market.
[02:41:17.382 --> 02:41:20.463]  It went down by a record level.
[02:41:20.463 --> 02:41:25.344]  The Congress panicked, passed it, and then October 4th, on that Saturday, Paulson says,
[02:41:26.144 --> 02:41:28.866]  We're not going to spend it to unfreeze mortgages.
[02:41:28.866 --> 02:41:30.667]  We're not going to tell you where it went.
[02:41:30.667 --> 02:41:34.609]  So they had blamed the victims, and said it was these people's fault.
[02:41:34.609 --> 02:41:39.252]  And I guess in a way it was, they got suckered, but that was only a part of the derivative scheme.
[02:41:39.252 --> 02:41:45.857]  And then the money disappeared, and a year and a half later, both administrations, they won't say where the money went.
[02:41:46.777 --> 02:41:49.498]  We know they're flush with trillions of dollars of cash.
[02:41:49.498 --> 02:41:50.879]  They're lending less money.
[02:41:50.879 --> 02:41:56.442]  They've frozen Main Street, destroying Main Street, so they can come back in and buy it up.
[02:41:56.442 --> 02:42:01.664]  The same Goldman Sachs people went in and engineered the derivative system.
[02:42:01.664 --> 02:42:03.705]  They sold derivatives to Iceland.
[02:42:03.705 --> 02:42:06.646]  Now Greece is going under, and they're coming and getting $146 billion
[02:42:08.647 --> 02:42:10.028]  From Europe and the U.S.
[02:42:10.028 --> 02:42:20.132]  to go pay Goldman Sachs, and Greece will still be in the same situation they were, except now they're ordering Greece to give them at least half their pension fund money.
[02:42:20.132 --> 02:42:20.632]  Yeah.
[02:42:20.632 --> 02:42:33.097]  And, well, what's also happened, remember that the Federal Reserve has bought one and a quarter trillion, let me say it again, trillion, one and a quarter trillion, of mortgage-backed securities.
[02:42:33.097 --> 02:42:35.238]  It scambles on mortgages.
[02:42:35.238 --> 02:42:37.499]  Now, we have two million people in foreclosure.
[02:42:37.990 --> 02:42:49.134]  That trillion and a quarter, instead of going to the banks to guarantee their best on these subprime mortgages, could have actually gone to and bought the mortgages from people at a discount to the banks.
[02:42:49.134 --> 02:42:50.075]  That's what Roosevelt did.
[02:42:50.075 --> 02:42:55.197]  Roosevelt set up, in 1933, the Federal Home Loan Bank.
[02:42:55.197 --> 02:43:00.519]  And he said that he ordered the banks to turn over their mortgages to the Federal Home Loan Bank.
[02:43:00.519 --> 02:43:03.320]  The mortgages are reset at a reasonable level.
[02:43:03.320 --> 02:43:05.881]  The banks were given, whether they liked it or not, government bonds.
[02:43:06.710 --> 02:43:21.633]  Because the mortgage payments were drastically lowered on people, because it was not, you know, a serious rate, but they had their own subprime, people were able to pay it back, but the housing market rose, and the government actually made billions of dollars on that transaction.
[02:43:21.633 --> 02:43:33.515]  But, so, instead of taking the trillion and a quarter dollars and helping people in trouble with mortgages, because they were given these crazy mortgages with 14% interest rate, knocking down the reasonable interest rate,
[02:43:34.318 --> 02:43:39.079]  Instead of doing that, we paid the bankers a trillion and a quarter and took the gamble off their hands.
[02:43:39.079 --> 02:43:40.620]  So people are still losing their homes.
[02:43:40.620 --> 02:43:51.142]  Okay, when Bloomberg talks about $23.7 trillion six months ago and now $28 trillion, that's other ways, I guess, monetizing debt and things that the Federal Reserve has done.
[02:43:51.142 --> 02:43:57.944]  But from the numbers I saw, when it got up to $15 trillion, this was mainstream news last year, that would have paid off all
[02:43:58.624 --> 02:44:07.314]  Of the mortgages in the country, from penthouses down to apartments, that would have paid off all the mortgages and then some.
[02:44:07.314 --> 02:44:13.702]  Yeah, and what we could, and what Roosevelt did in 33 was say, okay, you're going to pay a reasonable fee.
[02:44:13.702 --> 02:44:15.144]  They were charging 4%, 5% more.
[02:44:17.031 --> 02:44:20.894]  The banks will, because they lost their mortgages, they're going to get these bonds.
[02:44:20.894 --> 02:44:21.614]  And that's it!
[02:44:21.614 --> 02:44:26.858]  And then it's all guaranteed, and the housing market recovered, and people stopped losing their homes.
[02:44:26.858 --> 02:44:33.802]  And when people stop losing their homes, you know, you can't... I was just in 8 Mile Detroit.
[02:44:33.802 --> 02:44:40.447]  I got one guy who had a $100,000 mortgage from Bank of America Countrywide.
[02:44:40.447 --> 02:44:42.548]  Banks are paying 0% interest.
[02:44:42.548 --> 02:44:46.171]  Nominally, they're paying one quarter of 1% interest to borrow from the government.
[02:44:46.812 --> 02:44:49.514]  And it's all fiat money, so the limited time we have you here
[02:45:06.465 --> 02:45:21.590]  Go back over the IMF World Bank documents that were leaked to you in 2002, your warnings about this coming here, where you see this going, criminal probes of Goldman Sachs, but most of the regulators are former Goldman Sachs, this civil suit, is that just a whitewash?
[02:45:21.590 --> 02:45:22.910]  Where is all this going?
[02:45:22.910 --> 02:45:26.271]  Because the bankers are saying, let them eat cake.
[02:45:26.271 --> 02:45:28.672]  They've set up the euro, as you talked about.
[02:45:29.492 --> 02:45:37.317]  One of the top people involved in it openly admitting to you that it's about cornering countries and imploding them through economic conquest.
[02:45:37.317 --> 02:45:38.297]  That's right.
[02:45:38.297 --> 02:45:42.180]  Well, and in fact, let me start with the Goldman.
[02:45:42.180 --> 02:45:55.568]  What they've done is they've, instead of saying that the system is wrong, the system of creating these securities which are not backed by any assets, and it's basically backed by the taxpayer, because the bet is wrong, we think.
[02:45:56.485 --> 02:45:59.488]  We have $160 trillion of derivative security.
[02:45:59.488 --> 02:46:04.833]  That's a lot more than the Earth produces every year in product worldwide, okay?
[02:46:04.833 --> 02:46:06.354]  A heck of a lot.
[02:46:06.354 --> 02:46:12.080]  So even a 5% wrong, if it's 5% up, these guys literally make trillions.
[02:46:12.080 --> 02:46:15.343]  If it's 5% down, we have to back them up or they implode.
[02:46:15.343 --> 02:46:17.645]  That's their statement.
[02:46:17.645 --> 02:46:18.526]  What they're doing with this
[02:46:19.201 --> 02:46:26.288]  Goldman's action on the criminality is that they're going to say, well a couple of the trades were no good, but it's a fuel game.
[02:46:26.288 --> 02:46:33.696]  They're going to take this one French trader from Goldman and they're going to hang him out to dry, and a couple people, and that'll be it.
[02:46:34.824 --> 02:46:38.847]  But they're not going to say that the system itself is per se, rotten.
[02:46:38.847 --> 02:46:44.590]  They're not going to say that subprime mortgages are predatory and on their face, illegal.
[02:46:44.590 --> 02:46:52.194]  By the way, that's what Elliot Spitzer is about to file a 50-state lawsuit the week that they nailed him for not keeping his system right.
[02:46:52.194 --> 02:46:54.976]  You know, they had that information for a long, long time.
[02:46:54.976 --> 02:46:57.677]  They waited for that moment.
[02:46:57.677 --> 02:47:00.599]  So, when it gets to the IMF documents, what we're able to get
[02:47:01.149 --> 02:47:06.493]  And the IMF has never denied the authenticity of the documents, nor the World Bank.
[02:47:06.493 --> 02:47:16.981]  It's that these documents, which are confidential, which you can see in my book, Best Democracy Money Can Buy, are made out to go to my website, which I put on BBC television, by the way.
[02:47:16.981 --> 02:47:18.443]  Yeah, give us your website, Greg.
[02:47:18.443 --> 02:47:19.383]  Right.
[02:47:19.383 --> 02:47:21.905]  www.GregPalast.com.
[02:47:21.905 --> 02:47:23.667]  GregPalast.com.
[02:47:23.667 --> 02:47:25.708]  And we did this for BBC.
[02:47:25.708 --> 02:47:27.730]  And what we're able to find is that
[02:47:28.888 --> 02:47:30.669]  Basically, I'm writing a document.
[02:47:30.669 --> 02:47:32.771]  For example, we took the country of Ecuador.
[02:47:32.771 --> 02:47:34.452]  That's just one of the countries.
[02:47:34.452 --> 02:47:38.295]  Where they said, okay, we're going to screen this country and you're going to have riots.
[02:47:38.295 --> 02:47:44.580]  And then once we have the riots, then we could take strong measures because obviously then the military could move in.
[02:47:44.580 --> 02:47:46.622]  So it was like a planned-in riot.
[02:47:46.622 --> 02:47:56.089]  And I actually, I spoke to the chief economist, the former chief economist of the World Bank, Joe Stiglitz, who, just a couple years ago, before he got his Nobel Prize,
[02:47:56.752 --> 02:47:59.235]  This is not, you know, a fruitcake, off-the-wall guy.
[02:47:59.235 --> 02:48:03.980]  He's a Nobel Prize-winning economist, head of the World Bank, chief economist of the World Bank.
[02:48:03.980 --> 02:48:06.363]  He said, yeah, we used to call that the IMF riot.
[02:48:06.363 --> 02:48:09.226]  He said that's kind of built into the process.
[02:48:09.226 --> 02:48:17.295]  You squeeze nations like Greece, Ecuador, and by the way, you know, Florida and California, until they explode.
[02:48:18.308 --> 02:48:18.828]  Okay?
[02:48:18.828 --> 02:48:24.410]  And then you have the explosion, and then you can come in, and third world nations can come in with the military.
[02:48:24.410 --> 02:48:29.611]  Suddenly you have the IMF, teams of IMF emergency people come in.
[02:48:29.611 --> 02:48:37.173]  No one can object to the austerity measures, as they call them, which is basically just fucking, like you say, you just fuck out everyone's pension fund.
[02:48:37.173 --> 02:48:38.133]  It's just killing it.
[02:48:38.709 --> 02:48:45.514]  And we're now seeing these headlines that America needs austerity, and we have the IMF head saying they're going to do that here.
[02:48:45.514 --> 02:48:50.478]  We have the head of the European Central Bank saying world government of and for and by the banks.
[02:48:50.478 --> 02:48:53.661]  Gordon Brown saying global constitution of the banks.
[02:48:53.661 --> 02:48:58.224]  So these Ponzi scheme guys create more wealth than actually exists in the world.
[02:48:58.224 --> 02:49:06.711]  They buy everything up, then they implode it and say now you've got to give us your pension funds because we're holding a financial gun to your head.
[02:49:06.711 --> 02:49:07.852]  But then when you give them the money,
[02:49:08.072 --> 02:49:08.893]  I don't think they need to.
[02:49:08.893 --> 02:49:13.300]  I think if they're going to do this, they've obviously gotten a hold of money without it.
[02:49:22.924 --> 02:49:24.965]  I mean, we kind of go willingly.
[02:49:24.965 --> 02:49:30.106]  Other nations, I've been to places like Ecuador, and they're just more willing to go into the street.
[02:49:30.106 --> 02:49:36.068]  You know, burn cars when they raise the price of cooking oil.
[02:49:36.068 --> 02:49:41.069]  In Ecuador, the Indians came out of the hills and burnt down the capital.
[02:49:41.069 --> 02:49:44.270]  You know, Americans kind of shrug their shoulders and say, well, that's what happened.
[02:49:45.728 --> 02:49:56.693]  You know, when you have 10% unemployment officially, and you have the entire state of Michigan shut down, and people are kind of shrugging their shoulders and saying, that's life.
[02:49:56.693 --> 02:50:04.196]  I mean, I talked to this guy, Robert Pratt, who's an auto worker, and he's facing these foreclosures, you know what I mean?
[02:50:04.196 --> 02:50:06.517]  You know, he doesn't know where he's going to go.
[02:50:06.517 --> 02:50:12.300]  He's going to have to live in a motel room with his family of five kids, and you know,
[02:50:16.984 --> 02:50:18.345]  And it's only going to get worse.
[02:50:18.345 --> 02:50:23.627]  I mean, there are VAT taxes, carbon taxes that Ken Lay thought up.
[02:50:23.627 --> 02:50:26.648]  It just goes, you know, they control the left, they control the right.
[02:50:26.648 --> 02:50:29.789]  But see, Americans have never been financially fleeced like this.
[02:50:29.789 --> 02:50:32.910]  I mean, the government that I know of has never taken pension funds.
[02:50:32.910 --> 02:50:34.431]  They're now in Bloomberg proposing it.
[02:50:35.651 --> 02:50:43.016]  That's where I see all this going, and then that'll destroy the market even more, destroy confidence even more, which is exactly what the bankers want.
[02:50:43.016 --> 02:50:45.138]  Why can't we just arrest all these criminals?
[02:50:45.138 --> 02:50:49.701]  I mean, Ron Paul's agreed with me on air that they've committed a lot of crimes on record.
[02:50:49.701 --> 02:50:50.982]  Greg Palast, stay with us.
[02:50:50.982 --> 02:50:53.343]  We'll come right back and talk more with Greg Palast.
[02:50:53.343 --> 02:50:59.768]  He's been warning about this for more than a decade, and eight years ago, he got the IMF documents that prove this is premeditated.
[02:50:59.768 --> 02:51:01.429]  Now we have the Goldman Sachs doing the same thing.
[02:51:01.429 --> 02:51:02.810]  If you suffer from poor sleep,
[02:51:02.970 --> 02:51:04.631]  You've gotta try MyPillow!

[02:52:06.900 --> 02:52:10.623]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:52:10.623 --> 02:52:13.065]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:52:13.065 --> 02:52:18.931]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[02:52:18.931 --> 02:52:25.136]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[02:52:25.586 --> 02:52:31.571]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.

[02:52:46.004 --> 02:52:49.548]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:52:49.548 --> 02:52:50.949]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:52:51.509 --> 02:52:52.629]  It's here.

[02:54:05.453 --> 02:54:08.235]  Greg Pallast has got to get on a plane and fly up to Alaska.
[02:54:08.235 --> 02:54:11.977]  He's hot on the trail of the BP oil spill.
[02:54:11.977 --> 02:54:14.238]  GregPallast.com is the website.
[02:54:14.238 --> 02:54:16.139]  Our website's InfoWars.com.
[02:54:16.139 --> 02:54:19.901]  We'll talk about that in the next five minutes, the next little short segment, then he's got to go.
[02:54:19.901 --> 02:54:22.862]  Halliburton, maybe Culperin oil rig explosion.
[02:54:22.862 --> 02:54:26.324]  That's been out the last few days with the cement they were pouring.
[02:54:26.324 --> 02:54:27.265]  But I mean, Greg, look.
[02:54:27.685 --> 02:54:33.512]  They're so out in the open, hundreds of billions of dollars of stolen money that went to bonuses.
[02:54:33.512 --> 02:54:37.637]  They won't say where the money went, the rest of it.
[02:54:37.637 --> 02:54:39.159]  Why are they so arrogant?
[02:54:39.159 --> 02:54:40.741]  Why are they getting away with this?
[02:54:40.741 --> 02:54:45.968]  And how do we bring these guys to justice before they destroy the economy by design?
[02:54:47.210 --> 02:54:52.173]  Well, you know, people are pretty passive, numb is one, but the other is that people don't have information.
[02:54:52.173 --> 02:54:55.074]  Information, to me, is a powerful weapon here.
[02:54:55.074 --> 02:54:56.155]  They control the media.
[02:54:56.155 --> 02:55:02.418]  For example, you've got the media keeps talking, you know, hearing from this guy Peter Peterson.
[02:55:02.418 --> 02:55:07.060]  He's head of something called the Concord Coalition, talking about how we have to get rid of entitlements.
[02:55:07.060 --> 02:55:12.403]  That's basically taking away your social security and your veterans' pensions and your veterans' benefits.
[02:55:13.067 --> 02:55:14.168]  You know what?
[02:55:14.168 --> 02:55:15.528]  You are entitled to your entitlement.
[02:55:15.528 --> 02:55:16.249]  I'm sorry.
[02:55:16.249 --> 02:55:16.689]  You paid it!
[02:55:16.689 --> 02:55:18.289]  You paid it to your Social Security!
[02:55:18.289 --> 02:55:20.070]  It's an insurance plan, you know?
[02:55:20.070 --> 02:55:21.111]  And they want to take it away.
[02:55:21.111 --> 02:55:22.091]  Well, who's Peter Peterson?
[02:55:22.091 --> 02:55:25.533]  He's one of the... He's a billionaire investment bank.
[02:55:25.533 --> 02:55:27.954]  So, in other words, you shouldn't get the money.
[02:55:27.954 --> 02:55:28.514]  He should!
[02:55:29.386 --> 02:55:30.327]  You know, they don't tell you that.
[02:55:30.327 --> 02:55:32.128]  This guy's fighting his entitlement.
[02:55:32.128 --> 02:55:34.910]  Well, what he's saying is, turn over your pension to me.
[02:55:34.910 --> 02:55:44.237]  When they talked about privatizing the pension plan, you know, they were talking about basically, you know, Paul Krugman saying, hey, you know, this doesn't make any sense numerically.
[02:55:44.237 --> 02:55:45.818]  You can't make more money in the U.S.
[02:55:45.818 --> 02:55:48.860]  stock market than the government.
[02:55:48.860 --> 02:55:51.061]  Well, the answer is, they weren't going to keep it in the U.S.
[02:55:51.061 --> 02:55:54.484]  They were going to send it to China, where there's more money.
[02:55:55.182 --> 02:55:56.362]  Well, it's worse than that.
[02:55:56.362 --> 02:55:59.844]  I mean, I've tracked these big banks the last hundred years.
[02:55:59.844 --> 02:56:01.324]  They lobby for big government.
[02:56:01.324 --> 02:56:09.407]  They lobby for cities to take most of the tax money in the states and invest it in these comprehensive annual financial report funds.
[02:56:09.407 --> 02:56:13.028]  And then the public's only told about the budget, not all these other investments.
[02:56:13.028 --> 02:56:16.229]  I mean, this is, this is just pure criminality.
[02:56:16.229 --> 02:56:23.432]  Yeah, I mean, they're, you know, basically they're using the state, you're right, they use the state budget as piggy banks for their speculation.
[02:56:24.577 --> 02:56:34.049]  Uh, you know, and I see it in Europe, where I also work with the BBC, where, you know, I mean, Finland found a pension fund just sucked away on the derivative.
[02:56:34.049 --> 02:56:36.291]  They didn't even know what they were buying.
[02:56:36.291 --> 02:56:39.275]  Uh, you know, so it's, you know, and the money doesn't disappear.
[02:56:39.275 --> 02:56:41.197]  I mean, this idea that it doesn't disappear.
[02:56:41.197 --> 02:56:42.579]  It's going into someone's pocket.
[02:56:42.579 --> 02:56:44.121]  It doesn't, you know, simply evaporate.
[02:56:44.933 --> 02:56:46.875]  This is a big shift in wealth.
[02:56:46.875 --> 02:56:48.596]  Well, here's the problem, Greg.
[02:56:48.596 --> 02:56:51.259]  As you've studied and know, they will destroy a country.
[02:56:51.259 --> 02:56:56.063]  They will take a first world nation like Argentina and reduce it down into a third world hellhole.
[02:56:56.063 --> 02:56:59.266]  They will do that here if we don't stop them.
[02:56:59.266 --> 02:57:02.029]  But I guess you're just saying it's just going to happen.
[02:57:02.029 --> 02:57:02.389]  Well, no.
[02:57:02.389 --> 02:57:03.630]  I think if people are informed.
[02:57:03.630 --> 02:57:05.972]  I mean, one thing I've, you know, I've traveled around the world.
[02:57:05.972 --> 02:57:09.055]  Americans are actually impressive in one way, that they are reactive.
[02:57:09.055 --> 02:57:10.076]  They get the information.
[02:57:10.712 --> 02:57:16.493]  That's why, as Daniel Altsburg says, the good thing about Americans is that you have to lie to them.
[02:57:16.493 --> 02:57:19.714]  The bad thing is that it's fairly easy to do.
[02:57:19.714 --> 02:57:21.555]  So that's the problem.
[02:57:21.555 --> 02:57:25.556]  We're surrounded by a media which keeps saying the same thing.
[02:57:25.556 --> 02:57:26.696]  Get rid of entitlements.
[02:57:26.696 --> 02:57:32.817]  The Greek workers are guilty.
[02:57:32.817 --> 02:57:33.978]  It goes on and on.
[02:57:33.978 --> 02:57:35.858]  People borrow too much money for their homes.
[02:57:35.858 --> 02:57:37.579]  They deserve to lose them.
[02:57:37.579 --> 02:57:39.099]  Blaming the victim.
[02:57:39.099 --> 02:57:39.559]  Constant.
[02:57:40.353 --> 02:57:43.960]  As opposed to, and the poor banks, we have to save the financial system.
[02:57:43.960 --> 02:57:47.347]  When they don't mean that at all, they mean save the financiers.
[02:57:47.347 --> 02:57:48.930]  That's the big problem.
[02:57:48.930 --> 02:57:50.153]  People just don't have the information.
[02:57:50.657 --> 02:57:52.639]  They're holding us hostage.
[02:57:52.639 --> 02:57:58.123]  They're telling the people, you'll get your 401k, you'll get your pension if you let us raise taxes.
[02:57:58.123 --> 02:57:59.404]  And now they're so greedy.
[02:57:59.404 --> 02:58:08.992]  I'm sure you've seen the articles all over Forbes and Bloomberg where federal regulators are quote, ordering private pension funds to quote, invest in failed banks.
[02:58:08.992 --> 02:58:12.915]  You know, come knock on your door and say, Greg, I want you to invest in a failed bank.
[02:58:12.915 --> 02:58:13.696]  You don't have a choice.
[02:58:15.789 --> 02:58:17.050]  Well, exactly.
[02:58:17.050 --> 02:58:25.753]  The whole point is that they are trying, is that they are looking to you to provide them the capital that they've lost.
[02:58:25.753 --> 02:58:27.514]  That's what it's about.
[02:58:27.514 --> 02:58:30.475]  And we have to ensure all their bets that are made worldwide.

[02:59:54.190 --> 02:59:56.571]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.571 --> 02:59:59.352]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:12.915 --> 03:00:20.537]  Alright, we've got five more minutes with Greg Pallast, then I'm going to take a round of phone calls for Lex, Ruth, Tim, George, Howard, and others that are holding.
[03:00:20.537 --> 03:00:29.639]  Greg Pallast is working with the BBC, hot on the big petroleum spill going on the last two weeks.
[03:00:29.639 --> 03:00:32.959]  Greg, what's the bottom line on this in your investigation?
[03:00:32.959 --> 03:00:34.800]  Well, there's several things.
[03:00:34.800 --> 03:00:37.180]  One, this is the old game.
[03:00:37.180 --> 03:00:40.701]  British Petroleum actually owns the oil in Alaska.
[03:00:41.434 --> 03:00:49.401]  And the Exxon Valdez, despite Exxon having its name on the ship, British Petroleum was more to blame there because they were in charge of oil spill response.
[03:00:49.401 --> 03:00:53.344]  And just like this time, they lie about what they're capable of doing.
[03:00:53.344 --> 03:00:54.846]  They're supposed to have equipment out there.
[03:00:54.846 --> 03:00:56.347]  They're supposed to have these rubber skirts.
[03:00:56.347 --> 03:00:59.029]  You just need a lot of rubber, basically, to stop a spill.
[03:00:59.029 --> 03:00:59.590]  They didn't have it.
[03:00:59.930 --> 03:01:05.233]  In the Gulf, they didn't have it 20 years ago when the Exxon Valdez ran aground.
[03:01:05.233 --> 03:01:07.714]  That should have never been a big disastrous bill.
[03:01:07.714 --> 03:01:09.575]  It doesn't matter if the ship ran aground.
[03:01:09.575 --> 03:01:12.196]  That oil should have been contained.
[03:01:12.196 --> 03:01:17.138]  British Petroleum, I've been following these guys for 22 years.
[03:01:17.138 --> 03:01:23.321]  These guys, the way they deal with oil spill response, they lie, they obfuscate, they prevaricate.
[03:01:24.191 --> 03:01:26.152]  And, you know, that's why I'm going back up to Alaska.
[03:01:26.152 --> 03:01:27.752]  That's really weird.
[03:01:27.752 --> 03:01:28.552]  It's dark.
[03:01:28.552 --> 03:01:29.472]  It's the endless line.
[03:01:29.472 --> 03:01:39.795]  By the way, when Obama says, well, we still need the oil, and he opens up more of the coast of Alaska, well, that's not for America.
[03:01:39.795 --> 03:01:42.056]  That oil goes to Japan.
[03:01:42.056 --> 03:01:43.016]  That ain't for us.
[03:01:43.016 --> 03:01:43.736]  Yeah, what's the number?
[03:01:43.736 --> 03:01:46.277]  80% goes to Asia.
[03:01:46.277 --> 03:01:52.959]  Yeah, and by the way, when the pipeline was built in Alaska, the original law said that the oil must come to the U.S.A.
[03:01:53.797 --> 03:01:55.858]  And Clinton got rid of that rule.
[03:01:55.858 --> 03:01:58.259]  So now it goes to Japan and Asia.
[03:01:58.259 --> 03:02:03.422]  And then, you know, the profits go to London, because it's British Petroleum.
[03:02:03.422 --> 03:02:09.025]  And that's why they don't let people drill in certain areas, because people like BP are lobbying.
[03:02:09.025 --> 03:02:17.230]  Could this be a false flag event, because Obama had said they could drill, and that would let other companies in, and BP already was doing most of the exploration?
[03:02:17.230 --> 03:02:22.873]  Could this be a false flag as a pretext to shut down drilling, which Obama has now announced he's doing?
[03:02:24.224 --> 03:02:25.804]  I have no idea.
[03:02:25.804 --> 03:02:31.206]  All I do know is that these guys don't know what, you know, in terms of the actual drilling, they don't know what they're doing.
[03:02:31.206 --> 03:02:34.547]  And by the way, my information is that they didn't go down 18,000 feet.
[03:02:34.547 --> 03:02:36.548]  They went down much further.
[03:02:36.548 --> 03:02:38.888]  That's why they had this pressure burst.
[03:02:38.888 --> 03:02:41.649]  They have no idea what the hell they're doing.
[03:02:41.649 --> 03:02:44.510]  And they're operating blind, and they cheap out.
[03:02:45.591 --> 03:02:48.213]  You know, they're supposed to have containment barges.
[03:02:48.213 --> 03:02:49.333]  I didn't see them out there.
[03:02:49.333 --> 03:02:51.314]  They're supposed to have rubber booms.
[03:02:51.314 --> 03:02:55.236]  Why is it that the United States Navy is putting out 12 miles of rubber boom?
[03:02:55.236 --> 03:03:03.440]  And by the way, Mr. Obama, why did it take until Thursday to federalize a disaster that occurred on Saturday?
[03:03:03.440 --> 03:03:11.284]  You know, if they put that 12 miles of boom around the ship on Sunday, it would have been mostly contained.
[03:03:14.212 --> 03:03:18.274]  You know, the Obama administration screwed this up real, real bad.
[03:03:18.274 --> 03:03:22.135]  But BP is ultimately responsible and they couldn't care less.
[03:03:22.135 --> 03:03:26.036]  And don't forget, they're saying it's costing them $4 million a day.
[03:03:26.036 --> 03:03:27.997]  They sell $4 million, 4 million barrels a day.
[03:03:30.962 --> 03:03:34.845]  And the price of oil is up $2 a barrel because of the spill.
[03:03:34.845 --> 03:03:40.289]  Yeah, it cost them $4 million a day, but they make an extra $8 million a day.
[03:03:40.289 --> 03:03:43.251]  What about Halliburton?
[03:03:43.251 --> 03:03:45.652]  What about Halliburton reportedly?
[03:03:45.652 --> 03:03:46.073]  Right.
[03:03:46.073 --> 03:03:50.336]  Halliburton, okay, first of all, they probably drilled the well to 25,000 feet, not 18.
[03:03:50.336 --> 03:03:54.719]  Halliburton's supposed to be dumping a cement plug down that well.
[03:03:54.719 --> 03:03:57.541]  That's where they make 20% of their profit, Halliburton.
[03:03:58.161 --> 03:04:04.324]  And, you know, they're supposed to check the pressure before they drop the plug so they know that it's a big enough plug.
[03:04:04.324 --> 03:04:05.185]  Obviously they didn't.
[03:04:05.185 --> 03:04:11.067]  They just took the money and they just dumped the crap over into the cemented to the pipe and they didn't measure nothing.
[03:04:11.067 --> 03:04:12.848]  And this is the problem.
[03:04:12.848 --> 03:04:19.331]  These guys are cranking in the money and it's not, you know, then it goes bad and they go, oh gee, it's a shame.
[03:04:19.331 --> 03:04:20.572]  Why can't they plug it?
[03:04:20.572 --> 03:04:21.092]  We only got about 30.
[03:04:21.092 --> 03:04:22.533]  Well, why can't they plug it?
[03:04:24.156 --> 03:04:48.904]  It is so gigantic, and the pressure is so high, that they cannot, that it's beyond, they had no preparation for this, and they simply didn't include a remote shutoff valve, which Brazilian oil company has, Norwegians have, the other oil companies, when they drill, they have a remote switch, just like, you know, with your remote TV, so they can trigger a shutoff from a distance.
[03:04:49.583 --> 03:04:51.104]  They can't trigger the drone, though.
[03:04:51.104 --> 03:04:54.666]  Greg Pallas, when you get back with more info, we look forward to having you on.
[03:04:54.666 --> 03:04:56.046]  GregPallas.com.
[03:04:56.046 --> 03:04:57.707]  Good to have you back on with us.
[03:04:57.707 --> 03:04:58.368]  You got it, brother.
[03:04:58.368 --> 03:05:01.629]  Bye.
[03:05:01.629 --> 03:05:04.631]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:05:04.631 --> 03:05:09.973]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:05:09.973 --> 03:05:12.014]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:05:12.014 --> 03:05:17.017]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:05:17.017 --> 03:05:18.198]  How much do you want?
[03:05:18.198 --> 03:05:18.938]  When do you want it?
[03:05:19.318 --> 03:05:21.198]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:05:21.198 --> 03:05:22.279]  When will you need it?
[03:05:22.279 --> 03:05:24.459]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:05:24.459 --> 03:05:25.800]  Will there be any food?
[03:05:25.800 --> 03:05:27.340]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:05:27.340 --> 03:05:32.601]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:05:32.601 --> 03:05:36.182]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:05:36.182 --> 03:05:39.643]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:05:40.003 --> 03:05:41.224]  How much will you need?
[03:05:41.224 --> 03:05:42.144]  We don't know.
[03:05:42.144 --> 03:05:43.244]  How much do you want?
[03:05:43.244 --> 03:05:44.165]  All you can get.
[03:05:44.165 --> 03:05:45.265]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:45.265 --> 03:05:48.306]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[03:06:54.328 --> 03:06:57.190]  H-O-M-E G-A-I-N.com.
[03:06:57.190 --> 03:07:00.351]  Check them out today.
[03:07:00.351 --> 03:07:02.672]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[03:07:02.672 --> 03:07:05.053]  We are part of a New World Order.
[03:07:05.053 --> 03:07:08.255]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[03:07:08.255 --> 03:07:13.377]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:07:13.377 --> 03:07:17.559]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:07:17.879 --> 03:07:20.221]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:07:20.221 --> 03:07:22.762]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:07:22.762 --> 03:07:26.024]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:07:26.024 --> 03:07:33.609]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:07:33.962 --> 03:07:39.344]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:07:39.344 --> 03:07:42.205]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:07:42.205 --> 03:07:45.887]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:07:45.887 --> 03:07:46.947]  And I got news for you.
[03:07:46.947 --> 03:07:48.308]  You're everyone else.
[03:07:48.308 --> 03:07:49.788]  Invisible Empire.

[03:08:01.920 --> 03:08:04.688]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:08:04.688 --> 03:08:07.475]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:10.430 --> 03:08:11.971]  Alright, here's what I'm going to do.
[03:08:11.971 --> 03:08:14.172]  I'm going to go to Lex, Ruth, Tim, George, and Howard.
[03:08:14.172 --> 03:08:15.874]  I appreciate those guys holding.
[03:08:15.874 --> 03:08:20.917]  I won't be able to take any more calls after that because I've got other financial news I need to get to.
[03:08:20.917 --> 03:08:26.841]  Illegal alien groups rioted all over the country, set fire to buildings in Santa Cruz, attacked people.
[03:08:26.841 --> 03:08:32.584]  They've got signs up saying we're going to kill police if we're not given free health care, free housing, and no taxes.
[03:08:32.584 --> 03:08:34.165]  I mean, these are actual quotes.
[03:08:34.165 --> 03:08:35.907]  They're saying we're going to kill you with pickaxes.
[03:08:36.667 --> 03:08:38.149]  I mean, it just goes on and on.
[03:08:38.149 --> 03:08:41.032]  There's almost a complete national media blackout.
[03:08:41.032 --> 03:08:51.245]  AP reported on the people with torches marching in Santa Cruz, trying to burn down restaurants full of men, women, and children.
[03:08:51.245 --> 03:08:52.086]  That is coming up.
[03:08:53.843 --> 03:09:05.469]  I also want to get to the White House press dinner and some of the incredibly arrogant Orwellian statements from Barack Hussein Obama, real name Barry Sotaro, Indonesian citizen.
[03:09:05.469 --> 03:09:06.990]  Forget the Kenyan thing.
[03:09:06.990 --> 03:09:11.613]  You got his wife admitting he's from Kenya in a speech and you've got the fake...
[03:09:12.293 --> 03:09:12.533]  Thank you.
[03:09:12.533 --> 03:09:15.675]  James Traficant was by far the best guest, at least this last interview.
[03:09:15.675 --> 03:09:19.657]  It was the best interview I've heard on your show in 18 months of being a fan.
[03:09:19.657 --> 03:09:20.377]  Thank you so much.
[03:09:20.377 --> 03:09:24.199]  Get this guy a weekly spot or get him his own GCN show or something.
[03:09:24.199 --> 03:09:29.502]  But Ohioans love James Traficant and I know the truth or scene is going to start loving this guy too.
[03:09:42.566 --> 03:09:53.774]  I also want to say that I'm not a TV watcher, but last night I went to my buddy's house and I watched a new episode of The Simpsons, and it was about having a British-style surveillance system in the city of Greenfield.
[03:09:53.774 --> 03:09:54.034]  No, no, no.
[03:09:54.034 --> 03:09:56.095]  Burma's told me.
[03:09:56.095 --> 03:10:08.144]  The government with Mr. Burns, who's supposedly like David Rockefeller, plants uranium on Homer to claim terrorists are going to attack so they can set up a police state and loot the pension funds.
[03:10:08.948 --> 03:10:09.488]  Absolutely.
[03:10:09.488 --> 03:10:11.869]  I mean, it was so poignant and it fits in really well.
[03:10:11.869 --> 03:10:14.910]  So I encourage people to go to the evil hulu.com.
[03:10:14.910 --> 03:10:17.652]  It's on there and you can see it today.
[03:10:17.652 --> 03:10:24.574]  But expanding on that, six months before 9-11, Fox TV, same folks that run the Simpsons, ran a lone gunman episode.
[03:10:24.574 --> 03:10:27.095]  And I've talked to the people on the show, Dean Hagwin and others.
[03:10:27.095 --> 03:10:38.420]  The CIA came to them, planted that storyline that the government hijacks a passenger jet by remote control to fly it in the World Trade Center to blame it on Afghanistan and to set up a police state
[03:10:38.880 --> 03:10:45.342]  In the United States, and the government uses drills of the exact same thing happening, so NORAD stands down.
[03:10:45.342 --> 03:10:53.084]  So, it's just like Obama saying, yeah, at least my ratings are as high as the place of my birth, or are high in Kenya.
[03:10:53.084 --> 03:10:58.426]  That's why he said, you know, all these jokes are paid for by Goldman Sachs whether you like it or not.
[03:10:58.426 --> 03:11:00.827]  They're making money whether you laugh or not.
[03:11:00.827 --> 03:11:04.768]  Some Republicans have suggested the health care bill contained a few secret provisions.
[03:11:04.768 --> 03:11:05.488]  That's untrue.
[03:11:05.488 --> 03:11:06.649]  There are hundreds.
[03:11:06.649 --> 03:11:07.649]  That's actually true!
[03:11:08.925 --> 03:11:13.967]  See, so, so, see, criminals love to brag.
[03:11:13.967 --> 03:11:17.229]  They love to tell you, we're gonna do this on 9-11.
[03:11:17.229 --> 03:11:22.812]  They love to tell you, we're gonna set off a dirty bomb and blame it on Homer Simpson, aka the Tea Party.
[03:11:22.812 --> 03:11:26.953]  They love flaunting it as like a psychological preconditioner.
[03:11:26.953 --> 03:11:28.314]  Go ahead, Lex.
[03:11:28.314 --> 03:11:29.555]  Well, I agree with you totally.
[03:11:29.555 --> 03:11:31.376]  I mean, it does seem like they're planting seeds.
[03:11:31.376 --> 03:11:36.518]  If you'll let me be cerebral for just a split second, though, the subplot to the story is about how Lisa
[03:11:37.000 --> 03:11:43.605]  No one believes her because she has blonde hair, so she dyes her hair brown and suddenly everyone agrees with her opinions.
[03:11:43.605 --> 03:11:52.192]  And I think that's kind of a tell about where people put their faith, especially in terms of media outlets or information, whether it comes from the government or from different media outlets.
[03:11:52.192 --> 03:11:55.875]  I thought that was a really brilliant kind of subtext to the whole episode.
[03:11:55.875 --> 03:11:58.297]  I don't know if that'll be lost on most people.
[03:11:58.297 --> 03:12:05.503]  Um, so I do think you're right that they are planting seeds, but at the same time, I think that there's maybe kind of a little more, uh, uh, you know,
[03:12:06.184 --> 03:12:09.468]  A push to say, hey, if you're really paying attention, we're telling you what's going on.
[03:12:09.468 --> 03:12:20.379]  The last thing I want to ask you, Alex, and this is just playing devil's advocate, but when we see those people that are supposedly illegal, threatening violence and things like that, is there a chance that those people are COINTELPRO?
[03:12:20.379 --> 03:12:22.001]  That they're plants?
[03:12:22.001 --> 03:12:24.343]  I got my verbal militia buddies on the line here.
[03:12:24.343 --> 03:12:27.647]  We're all chatting while we're on and just kind of want to know what you think about
[03:12:28.231 --> 03:12:41.221]  I appreciate your call, but to even try to describe why I don't believe that's the case, hundreds of pieces of data go into my statement that this is real.
[03:12:41.221 --> 03:12:55.533]  If these were provocateur actions of the illegals, burning down buildings, knocking out the windows of 20 plus facilities, they said 18, now it's 20, running around with signs saying we're going to kill police, running around with pickaxes saying we're going to kill you,
[03:12:57.549 --> 03:13:02.358]  If that was provocateured, they'd have people, what are we going to do America?
[03:13:02.358 --> 03:13:07.507]  And they'd have a solution, you know, naked body scanners or kicking the illegals out.
[03:13:07.507 --> 03:13:08.709]  There's almost a complete
[03:13:10.054 --> 03:13:11.075]  News blackout.
[03:13:11.075 --> 03:13:17.238]  When something's staged, you see the PR frenzy that comes immediately when it happens.
[03:13:17.238 --> 03:13:24.762]  I mean, I knew the underwear bombing was staged, because 10 minutes after it was announced on the news, they were saying, don't worry, we've now ordered naked body scanners.
[03:13:24.762 --> 03:13:26.423]  I knew they'd ordered them a year before.
[03:13:26.423 --> 03:13:30.845]  Then it came out, witnesses on the plane, so they helped him get on the plane, he was protected, and the U.S.
[03:13:30.845 --> 03:13:34.967]  government admitted, okay, it was part of, you know, some secret thing, we ordered him to be allowed on.
[03:13:34.967 --> 03:13:39.010]  And then the evidence goes on from there, we cover it in my new police state film, The Rise of FEMA.
[03:13:40.130 --> 03:13:43.371]  You know, this woman saying, I got pickaxes, I'm going to kill you.
[03:13:43.371 --> 03:13:48.532]  If she is a provocateur, she's going to win the Academy Award.
[03:13:48.532 --> 03:13:49.712]  No, I've been around it.
[03:13:49.712 --> 03:13:51.273]  I've seen it.
[03:13:51.273 --> 03:13:52.533]  I understand it.
[03:13:52.533 --> 03:13:54.814]  And so, no.
[03:13:54.814 --> 03:13:58.615]  There could be provocateur in the future, but the globalists want the illegals here.
[03:13:58.615 --> 03:14:00.075]  They want to bankrupt the states.
[03:14:00.075 --> 03:14:01.935]  They want an outside voting bloc.
[03:14:01.935 --> 03:14:03.536]  So they're not covering it.
[03:14:03.536 --> 03:14:05.756]  It's the cover-up that tells you it's real.
[03:14:05.756 --> 03:14:07.697]  You know, we've had real terror attacks in America.
[03:14:08.561 --> 03:14:11.162]  We've had hundreds of them.
[03:14:11.162 --> 03:14:17.803]  Back in the 60s and 70s, there were hundreds of real communist bombings that would be in the news, but the back of the paper.
[03:14:17.803 --> 03:14:21.484]  And US policy was, we don't give attention to terrorism.
[03:14:21.484 --> 03:14:27.285]  And any mainline media reporter, you know, people that have been in the news for 30, 40 years, they'll tell you that was the rule.
[03:14:27.285 --> 03:14:30.526]  You report it, but you don't fear monger, and you don't give it a lot of attention.
[03:14:30.526 --> 03:14:34.387]  Because that then makes real terrorist attack more, if that's their aim.
[03:14:34.867 --> 03:14:37.528]  See, the terrorists want the media attention.
[03:14:37.528 --> 03:14:44.771]  So when it's a government-staged terror attack, they're going to hype it because they're the terrorists.
[03:14:44.771 --> 03:14:50.733]  You have to understand the psychology of this.
[03:14:50.733 --> 03:14:52.674]  But again, no, this is real.
[03:14:53.792 --> 03:14:59.996]  In fact, I had Watson post my film, Battle for the Republic, a mini film that was part of Endgame.
[03:14:59.996 --> 03:15:02.197]  It's the extras, or one of the extras.
[03:15:02.197 --> 03:15:05.218]  And, I mean, you can see illegals with police beating citizens up.
[03:15:05.218 --> 03:15:07.340]  I mean, they're with the police.
[03:15:07.340 --> 03:15:08.800]  They're with the government.
[03:15:08.800 --> 03:15:17.585]  I showed you a headline earlier out of Tennessee, where they got $105,000 from illegal aliens, drug money, and just let it go.
[03:15:17.585 --> 03:15:19.226]  In fact, will you guys pull that up?
[03:15:19.226 --> 03:15:20.007]  Because I can't find it.
[03:15:21.892 --> 03:15:23.093]  Got too many articles in here.
[03:15:23.093 --> 03:15:27.496]  See, I said I'd go to your calls, and I'm not even going to have time to if I don't shut up.
[03:15:27.496 --> 03:15:28.977]  Where is it?
[03:15:28.977 --> 03:15:35.041]  Pull up that headline that we printed an hour ago out of the Knoxville News, where they just let the illegals go.
[03:15:35.041 --> 03:15:36.902]  The illegal aliens are above the law.
[03:15:36.902 --> 03:15:39.323]  We'll put that on screen for people, and I'll give you the actual headline.
[03:15:39.323 --> 03:15:44.307]  Deputies seize $105,000 after Mexicans deny cash was theirs, and they just let them go.
[03:15:44.887 --> 03:15:47.549]  See, if that was a citizen, your life would be over.
[03:15:47.549 --> 03:16:01.378]  If citizens would have set fires in Santa Cruz, in front of the police, and been running around, there weren't any riot police there for their illegal alien rally, which was announced a week before, because it's politically incorrect to have police for them!
[03:16:01.378 --> 03:16:04.400]  But you got sound cannons and plenty of cops for the American people!
[03:16:05.040 --> 03:16:06.942]  I'm sick of being discriminated against.
[03:16:06.942 --> 03:16:09.163]  Whether you're Hispanic, black, white, it doesn't matter.
[03:16:09.163 --> 03:16:11.225]  The New World Order is for open borders.
[03:16:11.225 --> 03:16:13.247]  We have the SPP documents.
[03:16:13.247 --> 03:16:15.409]  We have got to expose this now.
[03:16:15.409 --> 03:16:18.191]  Ruth in Louisiana, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:16:18.191 --> 03:16:20.312]  Yeah, it's Alex, how you doing?
[03:16:20.312 --> 03:16:22.214]  You know, I have a suggestion.
[03:16:22.214 --> 03:16:31.902]  We need to call and email CNN, Fox, other news organizations, Washington, Schwarzenegger's office, excuse me, Governor Schwarzenegger, but anyway,
[03:16:32.518 --> 03:16:36.940]  And demand why the police are not arresting these violent protesters.
[03:16:36.940 --> 03:16:44.925]  You know, they arrested a G-20, non-violent protesters, but we are not doing anything to arrest these violent protesters.
[03:16:44.925 --> 03:16:52.209]  If I had a sign like that walking down my street in Louisiana, I'd be under the jail.
[03:16:54.432 --> 03:17:00.337]  I hear you, and here's the article on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com that everybody's got to get.
[03:17:00.337 --> 03:17:09.444]  In fact, if you go to PrisonPlanet.com, it's got the full headline that's particularly power-packed to get people to read it because it states, you know, what actually happened.
[03:17:10.546 --> 03:17:12.187]  I'm trying to find the article.
[03:17:12.187 --> 03:17:13.208]  Here it is.
[03:17:13.208 --> 03:17:19.994]  Corporate media plays down pro-illegal immigration thugs who terrorized Santa Cruz.
[03:17:19.994 --> 03:17:26.979]  Imagine the national uproar if 200 Tea Partiers had gone on a rampage with burning torches.
[03:17:26.979 --> 03:17:29.001]  I mean, in fact, that should be the headline.
[03:17:29.001 --> 03:17:32.244]  Illegal aliens with burning torches set fire to Santa Cruz.
[03:17:33.191 --> 03:17:55.117]  But again, if Tea Party people would have lit their cigarette wrong, and it had fallen on the ground, and there'd have been one foot area of grass burned, there'd be air raid sirens and police crying, and, we gotta take everybody's rights, we gotta ban bupane tanks, we gotta ban, you know, natural gas, we gotta ban gasoline tanks, cause somebody might make a bomb with it, they're calling for that in New York.
[03:17:55.117 --> 03:17:57.158]  Oh, it's all over, my God!
[03:17:58.925 --> 03:18:00.025]  Tea parties are evil!
[03:18:00.025 --> 03:18:00.706]  They're terrorists!
[03:18:00.706 --> 03:18:02.086]  They're going to murder everyone!
[03:18:02.086 --> 03:18:05.247]  Meanwhile, illegal aliens are beating people up in San Francisco.
[03:18:05.247 --> 03:18:09.648]  Firebombing attacks in restaurants full of people in Santa Cruz.
[03:18:09.648 --> 03:18:12.209]  Beating up police in front of everyone.
[03:18:12.209 --> 03:18:16.750]  Running around in Phoenix with signs saying, we're going to kill police attacking police.
[03:18:16.750 --> 03:18:19.431]  I mean, we're going to kill you with pickaxes.
[03:18:19.431 --> 03:18:22.512]  And the media is like, I mean, I have an ABC news piece out of Santa Cruz.
[03:18:23.092 --> 03:18:25.934]  Where they talk to people, and the people go, I think it's reasonable.
[03:18:25.934 --> 03:18:27.515]  They have a lot of reasons to be angry.
[03:18:27.515 --> 03:18:30.938]  Look, I don't like firebombing and groceries, you know.
[03:18:30.938 --> 03:18:34.221]  I mean, it's just off the charts!
[03:18:34.221 --> 03:18:36.222]  The mind control of this!
[03:18:36.222 --> 03:18:38.244]  I mean, this is what's so insane.
[03:18:38.244 --> 03:18:43.328]  The government keeps saying people that want to audit the banks and people that don't want the banker bailouts are terrorists.
[03:18:44.269 --> 03:18:51.334]  And then meanwhile, anybody who's actually violent, isn't anyone asking why this attempted bombing in New York happened on Commie Day?
[03:18:51.334 --> 03:18:53.435]  Because communists don't exist, the media says!
[03:18:53.435 --> 03:18:54.756]  There's no such thing as it!
[03:18:54.756 --> 03:18:58.559]  We just have a... I'm sorry, anything else, Ruth?
[03:18:58.559 --> 03:19:00.080]  Well, I'll tell you one thing.
[03:19:00.080 --> 03:19:09.146]  It just saddens me that this oil spill that, you know, they have not done anything about, and their solution is, you know, just
[03:19:09.927 --> 03:19:13.531]  Unboggling of what they want to do to sink all to the bottom.
[03:19:13.531 --> 03:19:15.674]  It's just going to devastate Louisiana.
[03:19:15.674 --> 03:19:17.496]  We have three major hurricanes.
[03:19:17.895 --> 03:19:27.399]  Well, ma'am, I know we're praying for you, and hopefully the National Guard can do something, but guess what the news we have coming up in the financial section towards the end of the hour?
[03:19:27.399 --> 03:19:30.720]  I was asking Greg Powell of the BBC about a false flag attack.
[03:19:30.720 --> 03:19:33.801]  Notice this happened the day before Earth Day.
[03:19:33.801 --> 03:19:37.263]  The response wasn't big, as it should have been.
[03:19:37.263 --> 03:19:40.504]  BP is one of the most globalist organizations out there, so is Halliburton.
[03:19:41.064 --> 03:19:46.989]  Just like they shorted the airline stocks the week before 9-11 at record levels, American and United.
[03:19:46.989 --> 03:19:49.972]  They didn't short all airline stocks, they shorted just those two.
[03:19:49.972 --> 03:19:52.814]  Rozzy Krongaard, director of the CIA, did.
[03:19:52.814 --> 03:19:54.455]  That's mainstream AP.
[03:19:54.455 --> 03:20:02.222]  Goldman Sachs reveals it shorted Gulf of Mexico right before this happened.
[03:20:02.222 --> 03:20:03.523]  Don't answer it!
[03:20:04.088 --> 03:20:12.191]  If fear strikes your heart when the phone rings knowing it may be another bill collector, it's time for you to call Zero Debt in 90 Days.

[03:20:20.014 --> 03:20:24.278]  Listen, if you're already in debt, does it make sense to get buried in another payment plan?

[03:20:54.946 --> 03:20:55.687]  Are you prepared?

[03:21:04.697 --> 03:21:06.058]  There is a difference.

[03:22:03.008 --> 03:22:09.293]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[03:22:09.293 --> 03:22:13.477]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[03:22:13.477 --> 03:22:15.418]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[03:22:15.418 --> 03:22:17.840]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[03:22:17.840 --> 03:22:24.686]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every

[03:22:40.709 --> 03:22:46.650]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for the report the Fed hopes you'll never see.
[03:22:46.650 --> 03:22:48.710]  As Good As Gold can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[03:22:48.710 --> 03:22:50.490]  If you have ever thought about owning gold,
[03:22:54.632 --> 03:23:02.537]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[03:23:02.537 --> 03:23:04.799]  We are part of a New World Order.
[03:23:04.799 --> 03:23:08.121]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[03:23:08.121 --> 03:23:13.225]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:23:13.225 --> 03:23:17.428]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:23:17.728 --> 03:23:20.072]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:23:20.072 --> 03:23:22.976]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:23:22.976 --> 03:23:25.880]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:23:25.880 --> 03:23:33.492]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:23:33.812 --> 03:23:39.215]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:23:39.215 --> 03:23:42.057]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:23:42.057 --> 03:23:45.739]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:23:45.739 --> 03:23:46.820]  And I got news for you.
[03:23:46.820 --> 03:23:48.161]  You're everyone else.
[03:23:48.161 --> 03:23:49.662]  Invisible Empire.

[03:24:08.307 --> 03:24:17.254]  Okay, I'm going to continue with your calls.
[03:24:17.254 --> 03:24:20.376]  I'm going to then get into the latest on the economy.
[03:24:20.376 --> 03:24:23.778]  This $146 billion rescue package of U.S.
[03:24:23.778 --> 03:24:27.401]  and European taxpayers are paying for in Greece is not a rescue package.
[03:24:27.401 --> 03:24:31.604]  It's money to Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and others on bets they made on derivatives.
[03:24:32.364 --> 03:24:38.408]  And of course, they'll get even bigger record bonuses and laugh at you and make jokes, and Obama will make jokes about it.
[03:24:38.408 --> 03:24:40.590]  That's coming up in the next segment.
[03:24:40.590 --> 03:24:49.716]  The disgusting behavior of Barry Sotaro, aka Barack Obama, at this commencement speech and at the press dinner over the weekend.
[03:24:49.716 --> 03:24:51.177]  Let's talk to Tim in Michigan.
[03:24:51.177 --> 03:24:52.018]  Tim, you're on the air.
[03:24:52.018 --> 03:24:54.079]  Hey, Alex.
[03:24:54.079 --> 03:24:54.940]  Yes, sir.
[03:24:54.940 --> 03:24:56.321]  Thanks for having me on again, buddy.
[03:24:56.321 --> 03:24:59.183]  Listen, we unknowingly both have
[03:24:59.875 --> 03:25:00.555]  I think.
[03:25:00.555 --> 03:25:04.637]  I believe they have the key to, uh, you know, who this, uh, Fed was.
[03:25:04.637 --> 03:25:06.497]  Um, and I tried to share this information.
[03:25:06.497 --> 03:25:09.538]  Listen, listen, the average listener that just tuned in doesn't know what you're talking about.
[03:25:09.538 --> 03:25:22.722]  Uh, AP reports the federal judge has ordered the release, uh, on bail of the Hattari militia, uh, and, and is saying in their ruling that it does look like it may have just been free speech and this was all just hype.
[03:25:22.722 --> 03:25:24.283]  They weren't planning to attack anybody.
[03:25:24.283 --> 03:25:24.603]  Go ahead.
[03:25:25.339 --> 03:25:25.980]  Exactly.
[03:25:25.980 --> 03:25:26.580]  Thank you.
[03:25:26.580 --> 03:25:27.721]  And you know what?
[03:25:27.721 --> 03:25:33.125]  I actually got a chill when you put that on the air because I said justice
[03:25:33.672 --> 03:25:41.934]  Sometimes it does work for the people, and just them letting them out on their own recognizance, you know, although they're watching them, you know, very carefully.
[03:25:41.934 --> 03:25:49.756]  Yeah, the judge is seeing the evidence that for a year and a half there was an FBI agent and an informant in there, nine members, two of them are feds, provocateuring them.
[03:25:49.756 --> 03:25:53.357]  He gives some speech saying there may come a time we've got to fight the government.
[03:25:53.357 --> 03:25:54.978]  Well, I mean, who isn't saying that?
[03:25:54.978 --> 03:25:56.878]  I mean, the government's completely out of control.
[03:25:56.878 --> 03:25:59.979]  And so you... Go ahead.
[03:26:00.749 --> 03:26:03.590]  Anyway, I just wanted to say a couple things.
[03:26:03.590 --> 03:26:09.553]  I want to be really careful so that this information doesn't get, you know, misconstrued between the two of us.
[03:26:09.553 --> 03:26:11.313]  I still have all the articles.
[03:26:11.313 --> 03:26:19.056]  What happened was how I feel that this Thomas Payette character is the inside fad.
[03:26:19.056 --> 03:26:23.118]  We both noticed the difference in his skin tone and he didn't even look like them.
[03:26:23.118 --> 03:26:25.639]  But what happened was, is my girlfriend and I
[03:26:26.209 --> 03:26:41.134]  I talked to you earlier in the show one day, and you had spoke about an article that the Wall Street Journal had put out specifically on this paycheck character, and they referred to some cooperating witness.
[03:26:41.134 --> 03:26:45.395]  Now what happened was, Alex, I went back in my history because I said, yeah, that's the article.
[03:26:45.894 --> 03:26:46.955]  And it was so weird about it.
[03:26:46.955 --> 03:26:47.556]  It was real vague.
[03:26:47.556 --> 03:26:50.340]  We didn't know if they were talking about him or somebody else.
[03:26:50.340 --> 03:26:53.224]  Now, I don't know if you remember that article, but you read it.
[03:26:53.224 --> 03:27:01.294]  Now, I remember it wasn't... I clicked back in my history, and I found that the article had been completely washed.
[03:27:01.875 --> 03:27:03.356]  And it was changed.
[03:27:03.356 --> 03:27:06.317]  I clicked on it, my history, it said Melissa... No, I noticed that!
[03:27:06.317 --> 03:27:07.497]  I noticed that!
[03:27:07.497 --> 03:27:21.243]  It's out there in our stacks, as we, you know, we keep the articles for a few years in big boxes, that the Wall Street Journal had said that, and then it had changed, but then weeks later it did come out that they did have the informants in there, Revaka Turingham, but didn't say the name.
[03:27:21.243 --> 03:27:26.305]  I had noticed, because I'd reprinted it, and I was like, it's the same headline, but where's that other article?
[03:27:26.305 --> 03:27:27.725]  It said something different.
[03:27:27.725 --> 03:27:28.766]  I noticed the same thing.
[03:27:29.546 --> 03:27:33.955]  And if you notice, underneath the Wash article, the second article that was in later that day,
[03:27:34.534 --> 03:27:37.576]  Underneath it, it says, European Press Photo Agency.
[03:27:37.576 --> 03:27:39.077]  That's not a mug shot!
[03:27:39.077 --> 03:27:42.480]  And then there was only one little paragraph about... That's right.
[03:27:42.480 --> 03:27:47.623]  It said that he was in another state now, and it wasn't even a mug shot.
[03:27:47.623 --> 03:27:51.866]  He wasn't in the regular mug shots, and I said, I bet he's the one.
[03:27:51.866 --> 03:27:55.869]  We don't know, but out of nine, one's an FBI agent, one's an informant.
[03:27:55.869 --> 03:27:56.910]  We've got to get on this.
[03:27:56.910 --> 03:27:58.131]  We've got to research it.
[03:27:58.131 --> 03:27:59.371]  This is a big break, though.
[03:27:59.371 --> 03:28:02.694]  In fact, pull up the AP article for folks, that the judge said, look,
[03:28:03.554 --> 03:28:04.915]  I'm releasing these people.
[03:28:04.915 --> 03:28:06.876]  But again, it gave the feds what they needed.
[03:28:06.876 --> 03:28:12.919]  These announcements that the Tea Party militia people are going to kill cops so they can then go to the cops.
[03:28:12.919 --> 03:28:17.181]  Look how the media lies and says I'm calling for cop killing when I'm calling for the opposite.
[03:28:17.181 --> 03:28:19.783]  But then when illegal aliens are doing it, they cover it up.
[03:28:19.783 --> 03:28:21.584]  I appreciate your call, Tim.
[03:28:21.584 --> 03:28:22.984]  Let's talk to George in Connecticut.
[03:28:22.984 --> 03:28:23.805]  George, you're on the air.
[03:28:23.805 --> 03:28:24.145]  Go ahead.
[03:28:25.543 --> 03:28:27.667]  Hey Alex, why can't we get the lead?
[03:28:27.667 --> 03:28:35.139]  Look, if we deprive them of the banks, that's basically the funds that they're running all these criminal activities at.
[03:28:35.139 --> 03:28:37.302]  They're running all sorts of drug money through that.
[03:28:37.302 --> 03:28:38.905]  You're talking about through Afghanistan.
[03:28:39.246 --> 03:28:40.226]  What do you think, Citibank?
[03:28:40.226 --> 03:28:42.267]  Half their money is practically drug money.
[03:28:42.267 --> 03:28:45.488]  Well, it's now admitted that our troops are there to help.
[03:28:45.488 --> 03:28:47.269]  They actually help grow the opium.
[03:28:47.269 --> 03:28:53.191]  Now, I've already been told that by countless troops, and it's now in Reuters, New York Times, and Fox, but they say it's good.
[03:28:53.191 --> 03:28:58.213]  We have to grow the opium, because if we don't grow it, Al-Qaeda will, and they'll get the money.
[03:28:58.213 --> 03:29:04.475]  No, if you decriminalize it, then nobody gets the money, and that's why they won't decriminalize it, because they're shipping that stuff in here.
[03:29:05.660 --> 03:29:12.089]  You know, why don't we use Rico and use, I can't remember the particular legal term, but you can sue as if you're the king.
[03:29:12.089 --> 03:29:15.753]  There's a particular statute that goes back to common law.
[03:29:15.753 --> 03:29:20.280]  If the state doesn't go after a criminal, you can go after the criminal as the king.
[03:29:20.640 --> 03:29:22.800]  They've just got so many corrupt judges.
[03:29:22.800 --> 03:29:24.161]  We need to have the grand juries.
[03:29:24.161 --> 03:29:29.922]  Ron Paul has said state grand juries need to indict Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan.
[03:29:29.922 --> 03:29:35.803]  Ron Paul gave a speech a month and a half ago saying the CIA ships the drugs in, we've had a coup d'etat on America.
[03:29:35.803 --> 03:29:38.623]  The government is criminal and is non-existent.
[03:29:38.623 --> 03:29:45.024]  They're running IRS TV ads saying we're watching you, we're going to take everything you've got, we're Big Brother.
[03:29:45.024 --> 03:29:49.765]  I mean, they are a bunch of rogue thugs trying to intimidate us, basically with a gun to our head.
[03:29:51.789 --> 03:29:55.711]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.711 --> 03:30:01.173]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.173 --> 03:30:02.474]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:30:02.474 --> 03:30:08.056]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[03:30:08.056 --> 03:30:13.099]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[03:30:13.099 --> 03:30:18.121]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[03:30:18.661 --> 03:30:23.882]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[03:30:23.882 --> 03:30:30.984]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[03:30:30.984 --> 03:30:32.104]  And here's the best part.
[03:30:32.104 --> 03:30:38.466]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.

[03:30:45.551 --> 03:30:48.794]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[03:30:48.794 --> 03:30:50.515]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[03:31:02.905 --> 03:31:07.451]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[03:31:19.424 --> 03:31:26.091]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[03:31:26.091 --> 03:31:32.077]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[03:31:32.077 --> 03:31:35.781]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[03:31:36.241 --> 03:31:40.546]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[03:31:40.546 --> 03:31:46.491]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[03:31:46.491 --> 03:31:50.055]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:31:50.055 --> 03:31:52.017]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:31:52.017 --> 03:31:53.158]  It's here.

[03:32:09.742 --> 03:32:12.984]  Are you confused by the thousands of products and brands?

[03:32:49.772 --> 03:32:51.915]  All the goodness with none of the side effects.
[03:33:05.057 --> 03:33:07.338]  Okay, there's no way to play all of this.
[03:33:07.338 --> 03:33:10.220]  Obama had a 38-minute speech.
[03:33:10.220 --> 03:33:12.702]  We have the whole thing posted at InfoWars.com.
[03:33:12.702 --> 03:33:14.623]  I hadn't even watched it all.
[03:33:14.623 --> 03:33:21.947]  I watched a few minutes of it and he was joking about Goldman Sachs robbing us and joking about the health care bill taking over.
[03:33:21.947 --> 03:33:26.850]  I just found another video that the guys have posted up at InfoWars.com.
[03:33:26.850 --> 03:33:29.892]  Obama jokes about killing people via drones.
[03:33:29.892 --> 03:33:32.514]  And at the start of the show, I had said I was going to play clips
[03:33:33.454 --> 03:33:45.396]  Uh, of this, uh, correspondence dinner, where he made jokes about the banks ripping us off, and I said that's similar to Bush making jokes about where are the WMDs at another correspondence dinner.
[03:33:45.396 --> 03:33:51.257]  None under here, none under there, showing photos of himself in the White House looking underneath his desk.
[03:33:51.257 --> 03:33:58.778]  This is how they throw it in our face, and what's so chilling is, Obama made jokes about Goldman Sachs and healthcare that are actually true.
[03:33:58.778 --> 03:33:59.559]  So did Bush.
[03:33:59.559 --> 03:34:01.819]  It's a big joke a million Iraqis are dead.
[03:34:02.932 --> 03:34:10.545]  Regardless of what you think of the war, lying about WMDs, as the White House and Downing Street Memo shows, is so criminal!
[03:34:10.545 --> 03:34:12.809]  And, well, it's coming up.
[03:34:12.809 --> 03:34:14.412]  It's coming up.
[03:34:14.412 --> 03:34:16.635]  And I have some other news I want to get to as well.
[03:34:18.800 --> 03:34:20.061]  This always happens in the last hour.
[03:34:20.061 --> 03:34:25.484]  It's one of the most important hours, I think, to listen to with a four-hour show because we end up kind of condensing everything that we haven't gotten to yet.
[03:34:25.484 --> 03:34:29.746]  I mentioned this earlier, but I want to get briefly back into it because it's so important.
[03:34:29.746 --> 03:34:34.909]  Greece gets $146 billion rescue in EU IMF package Bloomberg.
[03:34:34.909 --> 03:34:43.854]  Now, this headline ought to read that Goldman Sachs successfully takes over Greece, steals another $148 billion.
[03:34:45.578 --> 03:35:09.689]  Because when you read the actual news out of the Times of London and other publications of what's happening, they're telling Greece that private citizens and government citizens, whether you're retired government or private sector, they've got to give up half their pension funds and a few years later they'll get the other half.
[03:35:10.461 --> 03:35:15.903]  And they've got a pair of military police paid for with the taxpayer money, and they're gonna bank rob these people?
[03:35:15.903 --> 03:35:18.304]  If they don't like it, the cops will kill them!
[03:35:18.304 --> 03:35:23.987]  And when the cops end up losing their pension funds, they'll just suck it up and take it, because everyone loves to serve tyranny.
[03:35:23.987 --> 03:35:26.988]  They get off on it, feeling like they're part of the power structure.
[03:35:26.988 --> 03:35:35.051]  As long as these cops in Greece have a uniform, even if they're living in a shack and their kids have no future, at least they're over the other slaves.
[03:35:35.051 --> 03:35:39.133]  So, this has now been rammed through, and I wanted to go back to this Washington Post article.
[03:35:39.994 --> 03:35:43.677]  For nations living the good life, the party's over, says IMF.
[03:35:43.677 --> 03:35:54.806]  This is one of the big private banking consortiums that just got the hundred plus billion dollars in further bailout to the private banks in that country.
[03:35:54.806 --> 03:35:56.407]  And they're saying more, more, more.
[03:35:56.407 --> 03:36:02.833]  We have the internal IMF, World Bank, Goldman Sachs documents where they brag that they've engineered this entire system.
[03:36:02.833 --> 03:36:03.914]  So there's the Washington Post.
[03:36:04.454 --> 03:36:05.995]  I was saying austerity.
[03:36:05.995 --> 03:36:07.257]  You're not going to be able to retire.
[03:36:07.257 --> 03:36:08.478]  We're going to take your bank account.
[03:36:08.478 --> 03:36:10.720]  We're going to destroy whatever money you've got through inflation.
[03:36:10.720 --> 03:36:14.483]  We're going to pass VAT taxes and other taxes on top of the income tax.
[03:36:14.483 --> 03:36:16.145]  We're going to pass carbon taxes.
[03:36:16.145 --> 03:36:19.428]  And here is ECB President Favors Global Governance.
[03:36:19.428 --> 03:36:19.868]  Forbes.
[03:36:20.589 --> 03:36:32.259]  European Central Bank President, we played this last week, but here it is in Forbes, Jean-Claude Trichet, told Forbes that global government is extremely necessary if we want to prevent another financial crisis.
[03:36:32.259 --> 03:36:35.262]  So they engineer the crisis, as I told you a decade ago, they would.
[03:36:35.262 --> 03:36:37.224]  They've done it in third world countries over and over again.
[03:36:37.224 --> 03:36:39.125]  I was watching it happen there.
[03:36:39.125 --> 03:36:40.627]  I was saying, they're setting it up here.
[03:36:41.868 --> 03:36:43.669]  They're moving into our area.
[03:36:43.669 --> 03:36:44.589]  They're in Brazil.
[03:36:44.589 --> 03:36:45.490]  They're in Argentina.
[03:36:45.490 --> 03:36:46.451]  They're in Nigeria.
[03:36:46.451 --> 03:36:47.551]  They're in Malaysia.
[03:36:47.551 --> 03:36:48.492]  They're in Eastern Europe.
[03:36:48.492 --> 03:36:49.993]  They've done it to England before.
[03:36:49.993 --> 03:36:51.294]  They're saying they're going to do it here.
[03:36:51.294 --> 03:36:51.734]  Look out!
[03:36:51.734 --> 03:36:55.277]  Then we got government documents as we got closer that they were planning it.
[03:36:55.277 --> 03:37:02.161]  I have BBC reporter Greg Powell who, eight years ago, got the secret IMF documents where they were planning this here and had planned it in other nations.
[03:37:02.161 --> 03:37:07.385]  And once the society implodes, then you riot and they use that to bring in martial law.
[03:37:07.385 --> 03:37:09.166]  That is in the IMF documents.
[03:37:09.166 --> 03:37:10.347]  This is all planned.
[03:37:11.067 --> 03:37:12.388]  And if you don't riot, they don't care.
[03:37:12.388 --> 03:37:15.910]  They just blow up some truck bombs and blame it on you.
[03:37:15.910 --> 03:37:18.392]  See how that works?
[03:37:18.392 --> 03:37:25.617]  And he went on to say, raise taxes, cut your pensions, take everything you've got, read it from Forbes Magazine.
[03:37:25.617 --> 03:37:31.601]  And he's telling the investing class, go along with this if you want to keep your big pension funds.
[03:37:31.601 --> 03:37:39.207]  And the banking investment class is saying, okay, we're going to back you, rob everybody, destroy the entire economy, take everything.
[03:37:40.276 --> 03:37:42.577]  And now it's happening, the final phase.
[03:37:42.577 --> 03:37:48.740]  They're even starting to cut police, except in the big mega cities where the crooks live, where the bankers live.
[03:37:48.740 --> 03:37:55.924]  I see reports every day where towns in Ohio, in Texas, in California, in Michigan, in Florida, cut more than half of their police.
[03:37:55.924 --> 03:38:01.026]  And then it said in that article I read last week out of Ohio, where they went from 116 cops to 44.
[03:38:01.026 --> 03:38:05.548]  In fact, try to pull that up if you can.
[03:38:05.548 --> 03:38:06.749]  It was Ohio Sheriff
[03:38:08.169 --> 03:38:10.070]  Ohio Sheriff says arm yourself.
[03:38:10.070 --> 03:38:13.751]  I want to make sure I'm giving those numbers exactly right.
[03:38:13.751 --> 03:38:20.034]  And they say, oh, of the 40 plus cops, only one will be on patrol per shift, three cops a day.
[03:38:20.034 --> 03:38:22.515]  The other 40 plus are to raise revenue.
[03:38:22.515 --> 03:38:24.775]  There are no cops when you're getting raped and robbed.
[03:38:24.775 --> 03:38:26.676]  There are no cops when you have a wreck.
[03:38:26.676 --> 03:38:29.217]  And this is now being announced all over.
[03:38:29.217 --> 03:38:33.379]  All of the money, all of it, will go to the bankers.
[03:38:34.500 --> 03:38:34.941]  All of it.
[03:38:34.941 --> 03:38:39.104]  This is robbery on a level never before seen.
[03:38:39.104 --> 03:38:40.205]  So I wanted to go over that.
[03:38:40.205 --> 03:38:42.627]  Now, I'm going to get into the Correspondents' Dinner.
[03:38:42.627 --> 03:38:50.134]  I'm going to get into this other commencement speech that Barry Sitaro, aka Barack Obama, gave over the weekend.
[03:38:50.134 --> 03:38:53.858]  But before we do that, I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up of Minus Resources.
[03:38:54.773 --> 03:38:57.895]  Who owns this radio network, the Genesis Network, as well.
[03:38:57.895 --> 03:38:59.656]  He's been in gold and silver for 31 years.
[03:38:59.656 --> 03:39:03.358]  He's had minus resources for 13 years, almost 14 years.
[03:39:03.358 --> 03:39:07.281]  He was a sponsor of my radio show before I was even on the network he started.
[03:39:07.281 --> 03:39:10.423]  And, look, the bankers are going to rob everything.
[03:39:10.423 --> 03:39:11.603]  They're going to devalue the dollar.
[03:39:11.603 --> 03:39:13.084]  They're going to take your bank account.
[03:39:13.084 --> 03:39:14.905]  They're going to try to take your pension fund.
[03:39:14.905 --> 03:39:17.287]  The way to go is the mason jars, folks.
[03:39:17.287 --> 03:39:18.708]  You know, bury that stuff.
[03:39:18.708 --> 03:39:21.049]  Or put it in a safety deposit box under another name.
[03:39:21.049 --> 03:39:21.750]  Whatever you do,
[03:39:23.174 --> 03:39:25.435]  Or bury it 100 miles away, whatever.
[03:39:25.435 --> 03:39:27.015]  Get gold and silver.
[03:39:27.015 --> 03:39:29.476]  Get it today, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:39:29.476 --> 03:39:36.918]  And Ted Anderson, a couple months ago when gold was $1,050 an ounce, he bought a bunch of it.
[03:39:36.918 --> 03:39:38.058]  He sold out of that.
[03:39:38.058 --> 03:39:41.279]  He sold it to you as it went to $1,100, $1,150, and right up close to $1,200 an ounce right now, $1,200 an ounce.
[03:39:49.850 --> 03:39:53.112]  It had to go up, but it's still lower than anybody else has.
[03:39:53.112 --> 03:39:56.694]  This is still gold and silver he bought in the next wave.
[03:39:56.694 --> 03:40:03.859]  As it was going up, he was buying it and holding it to sell it to you at a lower price once it went up.
[03:40:03.859 --> 03:40:04.980]  You can't beat that deal.
[03:40:04.980 --> 03:40:10.483]  So I wanted to briefly have Ted Anderson up to tell folks about today's special offer and the new prices.
[03:40:10.483 --> 03:40:11.724]  Ted Anderson.
[03:40:11.724 --> 03:40:13.365]  Yeah, hey, thanks for having me up, Alex.
[03:40:13.365 --> 03:40:14.786]  It's funny watching the U.S.
[03:40:14.786 --> 03:40:18.088]  dollar rise as gold rises even faster.
[03:40:18.547 --> 03:40:23.990]  Which just means that the Europeans' currencies are falling faster than the United States dollar is.
[03:40:23.990 --> 03:40:27.192]  It's just, you know, before I would look for the U.S.
[03:40:27.192 --> 03:40:29.454]  dollar to fall for gold to rise in price.
[03:40:29.454 --> 03:40:32.616]  Now gold just rises against all the currencies no matter what's going on.
[03:40:33.080 --> 03:40:35.922]  There's just so much economic activity out here.
[03:40:35.922 --> 03:40:42.626]  People should be shaking in their shoes if they knew how much debt was growing and what the consequences of that would be to our economy.
[03:40:42.626 --> 03:40:46.509]  Obama has spent more money than all presidents before him combined and he just got it started.
[03:40:46.509 --> 03:40:49.631]  He did that before he was in office a year.
[03:40:49.631 --> 03:40:54.854]  All laws of economics say they're going to try to take the pension funds and they will devalue the dollar.
[03:40:55.014 --> 03:40:56.516]  Well, you're already seeing that in Greece.
[03:40:56.516 --> 03:41:02.784]  Could you imagine if that was happening here in the United States, that we're going to have to cut our pension funds because some foreigner says we have to do it?
[03:41:02.784 --> 03:41:03.665]  They're now announcing!
[03:41:03.665 --> 03:41:05.547]  The feds are saying they're getting ready to!
[03:41:05.547 --> 03:41:07.770]  You know, obviously that's going to happen here too.
[03:41:07.770 --> 03:41:08.611]  If you want to have any
[03:41:10.434 --> 03:41:18.338]  Oh, they're already brainwashing the yuppies that that's how they... And yuppies will want to feel like they're official and in power, so they'll go, here's my money.
[03:41:18.338 --> 03:41:19.459]  I'm agreeing with the government.
[03:41:19.459 --> 03:41:20.239]  I have power.
[03:41:20.239 --> 03:41:21.120]  I'm part of it.
[03:41:21.120 --> 03:41:24.642]  It's a delusional fruitcake population of idiots.
[03:41:24.642 --> 03:41:28.544]  I'm not talking about everybody, but the people that think this is cute are a bunch of scum.
[03:41:29.485 --> 03:41:33.329]  Well, gold hitting a peak today at $1,189 already today.
[03:41:33.329 --> 03:41:35.951]  Obviously, we're in a bull market in the gold.
[03:41:35.951 --> 03:41:38.594]  It's reflecting all that you're talking about.
[03:41:38.594 --> 03:41:40.556]  It's normally down in the summer and it's going up.
[03:41:40.556 --> 03:41:41.517]  Can you imagine the fall?
[03:41:42.077 --> 03:41:42.797]  I know.
[03:41:42.797 --> 03:41:49.460]  Alex, actually, I was thinking the fall is going to be the time that we're going to see the greatest move in gold, but you know what?
[03:41:49.460 --> 03:41:50.641]  It may not work out this way.
[03:41:50.641 --> 03:41:52.762]  We might see the summer doing it.
[03:41:52.762 --> 03:42:02.226]  It's just completely defying gravity, and it's obviously because the United States dollar's in trouble, and it's in trouble like the European currencies are in trouble.
[03:42:02.226 --> 03:42:06.408]  It's just that the European currencies are reflecting a larger drop right now than the U.S.
[03:42:06.408 --> 03:42:07.228]  dollar is.
[03:42:07.228 --> 03:42:08.549]  But yeah, gold has been going up.
[03:42:09.042 --> 03:42:12.665]  Currently right now, we still have the Franken Forecaster offer.
[03:42:12.665 --> 03:42:14.786]  They're currently right now $254.68.
[03:42:14.786 --> 03:42:19.190]  A little bit higher than it was before, but not by much.
[03:42:19.190 --> 03:42:21.471]  And I can tell you that is a low price.
[03:42:21.471 --> 03:42:23.733]  And when you factor in the fact that you're going to get a $159 subscription,
[03:42:25.239 --> 03:42:29.922]  To Bob Chapman's newsletter, it just is absolutely out of this world.
[03:42:29.922 --> 03:42:34.906]  The silver Walking Liberty halves are at $9.75, still holding them at that price.
[03:42:34.906 --> 03:42:39.449]  That was the price I had them when silver was down closer to $15 an ounce.
[03:42:39.449 --> 03:42:42.951]  Right now, silver is just touching $19 an ounce.
[03:42:42.951 --> 03:42:44.792]  Obviously, a very good buy.
[03:42:44.792 --> 03:42:52.137]  Usually, those things trade for more than half of the spot price, and it's certainly getting way out of whack there.
[03:42:52.137 --> 03:42:53.498]  That's a great coin to be buying.
[03:42:54.076 --> 03:42:55.899]  Uh, British Sovereign's 232, I'm sorry, 324.43.
[03:43:00.069 --> 03:43:12.193]  Another good, I try to pick on smaller gold pieces, because when it comes right down to trading, for the goods and services that you need, you need fractional gold, and you need some smaller pieces of silver.
[03:43:12.193 --> 03:43:15.754]  And those British Sovereigns and the Franks just fall perfectly for that.
[03:43:15.754 --> 03:43:18.374]  If you're interested, you can pick up some of the U.S.
[03:43:18.374 --> 03:43:18.634]  Eagles.
[03:43:18.634 --> 03:43:20.135]  We have supplies of those.
[03:43:20.135 --> 03:43:26.917]  We have a lot of supply right now, which is sort of amazing, because typically in the marketplace, it's not like this.
[03:43:26.917 --> 03:43:27.577]  When you have a
[03:43:28.373 --> 03:43:28.693]  I think so.
[03:43:48.654 --> 03:43:51.275]  So you're not having a problem getting gold and silver.
[03:43:51.275 --> 03:43:52.676]  Folks, get yours today.
[03:43:52.676 --> 03:44:02.721]  I mean, earlier I played that Pennsylvania Tax Authority ad where they show Big Brother watching you saying, nice house, nice car, give us what we want.
[03:44:02.721 --> 03:44:06.282]  I mean, they almost said, or, you know, your kids are going to go bye-bye.
[03:44:06.282 --> 03:44:08.783]  I mean, you talk about a mafia video.
[03:44:08.783 --> 03:44:10.184]  Did you see that video, Ted?
[03:44:10.184 --> 03:44:10.504]  I didn't.
[03:44:10.504 --> 03:44:11.685]  I'll have to go take a look at that.
[03:44:12.230 --> 03:44:15.814]  Well, it's up on GCNlive.com if people want to go look at it.
[03:44:15.814 --> 03:44:24.842]  Ted Anderson, let me give people the toll-free number so they can call and talk to the brokers and take advantage of all those great deals on gold and silver, that half-dollar silver.
[03:44:24.842 --> 03:44:26.584]  I mean, that's an insane deal right there.
[03:44:26.584 --> 03:44:26.644]  800-686-2237.
[03:44:26.644 --> 03:44:26.684]  800-686-2237.
[03:44:32.850 --> 03:44:37.113]  Ladies and gentlemen, start getting into gold and silver today, even if you buy a coin or two of each.
[03:44:37.113 --> 03:44:43.998]  The point is, start moving away from paper assets if you've got any brain in your head, and I know a lot of you are smarter than I am, so take action.
[03:44:43.998 --> 03:44:44.118]  800-686-2237.
[03:44:44.118 --> 03:44:44.358]  800-686-2237.
[03:44:44.358 --> 03:44:45.459]  Ted, thank you for joining us.
[03:44:45.459 --> 03:44:46.599]  Yeah, thanks for having me up, Alex.
[03:44:46.599 --> 03:44:46.739]  You bet.
[03:44:54.815 --> 03:45:02.897]  Okay, in fact, in the last segment, if I have time, I want to play that Pennsylvania brainwashing ad one more time for those who just joined us.
[03:45:02.897 --> 03:45:11.280]  But right now, I want to play a clip of Obama from a commencement speech in Michigan late last week.
[03:45:11.280 --> 03:45:15.701]  And when you listen to what he has to say, it's so arrogant.
[03:45:15.701 --> 03:45:20.843]  He's saying you basically can't criticize the government because the government represents the people.
[03:45:20.843 --> 03:45:21.883]  And we're a democracy.
[03:45:22.702 --> 03:45:26.783]  No, in a democracy, 49% can be robbed by the other 51%.
[03:45:26.783 --> 03:45:36.286]  In a democracy, if they ship in enough illegal aliens, they can vote to take our guns, whatever they want, and then we'll lose our Second Amendment.
[03:45:36.286 --> 03:45:40.207]  In a republic, everyone's rights are protected.
[03:45:40.207 --> 03:45:41.968]  And Obama knows that.
[03:45:41.968 --> 03:45:42.888]  He understands that.
[03:45:42.888 --> 03:45:47.229]  So this message of, when you criticize the government, you're criticizing the people.
[03:45:47.229 --> 03:45:49.950]  No, the government, when it's outside the Bill of Rights and Constitution,
[03:45:51.474 --> 03:45:56.358]  It is our right, it is our duty to overthrow it according to the Declaration of Independence.
[03:45:56.358 --> 03:46:00.861]  But see, that's terror talk today because we're facing somebody similar to King George III.
[03:46:00.861 --> 03:46:03.322]  Let's go ahead and play this first clip.
[03:46:03.322 --> 03:46:05.684]  Sometimes regulations fail.
[03:46:05.684 --> 03:46:10.668]  Sometimes their benefits don't justify their costs.
[03:46:10.668 --> 03:46:16.412]  But what troubles me is when I hear people say that all of government is inherently bad.
[03:46:16.412 --> 03:46:20.455]  And one of my favorite signs during the healthcare debate was somebody said, keep
[03:46:21.428 --> 03:46:34.814]  Your government hands out of my Medicare.
[03:46:34.814 --> 03:46:41.777]  Which is essentially saying, keep government out of my government run health care plan.
[03:46:41.777 --> 03:46:43.038]  These are arguments we're having.
[03:46:43.846 --> 03:46:46.747]  So that's how his logic works.
[03:46:46.747 --> 03:46:56.248]  We have a 10% growth rate on average, no inflation, from 1789 until 1913, 97 years ago we get a private banking cartel.
[03:46:56.248 --> 03:46:58.929]  The banks are robbing us and looting us.
[03:46:58.929 --> 03:47:08.390]  The people are saying, don't take over health care, lower the quality and raise the cost as a tax to the bank-owned insurance companies.
[03:47:08.390 --> 03:47:10.951]  And that's what the health care plan does.
[03:47:10.951 --> 03:47:12.131]  We've got the banking bill.
[03:47:13.154 --> 03:47:15.715]  And I was going to go over that if we have time, I will.
[03:47:15.715 --> 03:47:23.920]  Where subsection by subsection, the big megabanks wrote it to where they can only be involved in banking and can shut down their competition.
[03:47:23.920 --> 03:47:27.822]  And it surveils every transaction you make in your own bank account.
[03:47:27.822 --> 03:47:31.604]  No longer if it's $10,000 does the government get a report.
[03:47:31.604 --> 03:47:35.146]  Now everything you do is in a government database.
[03:47:35.146 --> 03:47:37.867]  Then it can be stolen, lost, abused, used.
[03:47:37.867 --> 03:47:39.628]  I mean, this is so horrible.
[03:47:39.628 --> 03:47:40.849]  Section by section.
[03:47:42.165 --> 03:47:51.473]  And that takes us now to Obama takes digs at birthers, GOP, and his adversaries.
[03:47:51.473 --> 03:47:53.735]  And everything he's saying here is true.
[03:47:53.735 --> 03:47:55.496]  In fact, first let's play Bush.
[03:47:55.496 --> 03:47:58.139]  Bush making jokes about the WMDs.
[03:47:58.139 --> 03:48:00.401]  We'll cue that up and play that in a moment.
[03:48:02.947 --> 03:48:04.508]  Because this is similar.
[03:48:04.508 --> 03:48:07.729]  This is similar to what Obama's doing, telling the truth.
[03:48:07.729 --> 03:48:09.689]  Bush makes jokes looking under his desk.
[03:48:09.689 --> 03:48:12.050]  No WMD's there, no WMD's here.
[03:48:12.050 --> 03:48:13.591]  It's a joke to kill a million people.
[03:48:13.591 --> 03:48:14.991]  It's a joke to take us to war.
[03:48:14.991 --> 03:48:16.952]  It's a joke for thousands of our troops to die.
[03:48:16.952 --> 03:48:18.452]  Here it is.
[03:48:18.452 --> 03:48:28.675]  Those weapons of mass destruction gotta be somewhere.
[03:48:28.675 --> 03:48:29.836]  Nope, no weapons over there.
[03:48:39.458 --> 03:48:43.500]  Maybe under here.
[03:48:43.500 --> 03:48:50.503]  And it turns out in another clip we have up on InfoWars, we don't have time to play, Obama jokes about killing people via drones.
[03:48:50.503 --> 03:48:54.805]  This is all meant to throw it in our face and just to train us to accept anything.
[03:48:54.805 --> 03:49:01.528]  Now here's Obama saying, at least my ratings are high at the place of my birth.
[03:49:01.528 --> 03:49:04.689]  A joke about him being born in Kenya.
[03:49:04.689 --> 03:49:06.550]  And the AP interprets that as I do.
[03:49:06.550 --> 03:49:08.011]  This is a big joke.
[03:49:08.011 --> 03:49:08.731]  Here is that clip.
[03:49:09.974 --> 03:49:15.099]  Except for my approval ratings, which have just gone down.
[03:49:15.099 --> 03:49:16.361]  But that's politics.
[03:49:16.361 --> 03:49:18.243]  It doesn't bother me.
[03:49:18.243 --> 03:49:23.008]  Besides, I happen to know that my approval ratings are still very high in the country of my birth.
[03:49:26.258 --> 03:49:28.960]  See, flaunting it in your face.
[03:49:28.960 --> 03:49:34.604]  We know he was born there, but it's 100% he was an Indonesian citizen and gave up his U.S.
[03:49:34.604 --> 03:49:37.465]  citizenship, making him ineligible.
[03:49:37.465 --> 03:49:39.967]  The next one is one of the most disgusting.
[03:49:39.967 --> 03:49:42.769]  All of my jokes here tonight are brought to you by our friends at Goldman Sachs.
[03:49:42.769 --> 03:49:44.410]  They actually put him in office, it's true.
[03:49:44.410 --> 03:49:47.032]  Don't worry, because they make money whether you laugh or not.
[03:49:47.032 --> 03:49:48.873]  See, it's saying, we don't care if you're laughing.
[03:49:48.873 --> 03:49:51.215]  We're going to rob you, and that's the end of it.
[03:49:51.215 --> 03:49:52.336]  We're the mafia.
[03:49:52.336 --> 03:49:53.496]  So shut up and take it.
[03:49:53.496 --> 03:49:53.977]  Here he is.
[03:49:56.394 --> 03:50:03.458]  By the way, all of the jokes here tonight are brought to you by our friends at Goldman Sachs.
[03:50:03.458 --> 03:50:05.779]  So you don't have to worry.
[03:50:05.779 --> 03:50:08.821]  They make money whether you laugh or not.
[03:50:08.821 --> 03:50:12.343]  See, and Republicans like Bush joking about a million dead Iraqis.
[03:50:12.343 --> 03:50:16.165]  Well, now you're going to see Obama joke about taking your pension fund.
[03:50:16.165 --> 03:50:20.548]  As we go out to break, let's play this last clip, which is actually true.
[03:50:20.548 --> 03:50:24.030]  There are hundreds of provisions in the bill that he lied about.
[03:50:24.030 --> 03:50:24.330]  Here it is.
[03:50:27.302 --> 03:50:33.670]  Some Republicans have suggested that the bill contains a few secret provisions.
[03:50:33.670 --> 03:50:35.031]  That's ridiculous.
[03:50:35.031 --> 03:50:38.315]  There aren't a few secret provisions in the health care plan.
[03:50:38.315 --> 03:50:39.757]  There are like hundreds.
[03:50:41.854 --> 03:50:43.775]  See, this is their rare time.
[03:50:43.775 --> 03:50:56.539]  Tonight, meeting with tens of thousands of elitist scum and the lying corporate media there, laughing and joking because they all feel like they're the winners who have buffaloed the American people.
[03:50:56.539 --> 03:51:01.261]  Yes, there were hundreds of provisions, just like in the banking bill.
[03:51:02.156 --> 03:51:02.957]  As the U.S.
[03:51:02.957 --> 03:51:11.524]  and the world slip slowly into economic and financial gridlock, some economists predict a global financial meltdown and economic collapse worse than we have ever seen.
[03:51:11.524 --> 03:51:14.267]  Don't wait for the edicts to start coming out of Washington, D.C.
[03:51:14.267 --> 03:51:15.948]  before you begin to fill your pantry.
[03:51:15.948 --> 03:51:18.831]  Prepare for financial and economic Armageddon now.
[03:51:18.831 --> 03:51:24.896]  Ready Reserve Food has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for nearly 40 years.
[03:51:24.896 --> 03:51:28.299]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer, unlike other companies that just broker
[03:51:28.319 --> 03:51:28.719]  I think so.
[03:51:45.757 --> 03:51:48.138]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[03:51:48.138 --> 03:51:49.859]  We are part of a New World Order.
[03:51:49.859 --> 03:51:52.001]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[03:52:10.251 --> 03:52:15.354]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:52:15.354 --> 03:52:19.876]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:52:19.876 --> 03:52:22.218]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:52:22.218 --> 03:52:25.099]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:52:25.099 --> 03:52:28.021]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:52:28.021 --> 03:52:35.605]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:52:35.945 --> 03:52:41.348]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:52:41.348 --> 03:52:43.649]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:52:43.649 --> 03:52:47.871]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:52:47.871 --> 03:52:48.952]  And I got news for you.
[03:52:48.952 --> 03:52:50.293]  You're everyone else.
[03:52:50.293 --> 03:52:51.793]  Invisible Empire.

[03:53:03.686 --> 03:53:04.927]  This is not a drill.
[03:53:04.927 --> 03:53:07.429]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[03:53:07.429 --> 03:53:09.331]  Gun sales are on a staggering pace.
[03:53:09.331 --> 03:53:16.556]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[03:53:16.556 --> 03:53:20.940]  Now, a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.
[03:53:20.940 --> 03:53:31.188]  You'll learn step-by-step, battle-hardened techniques, where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them, how to create the perfect hiding place, as well as the places you should never hide your guns.
[03:53:31.428 --> 03:53:33.069]  Under any circumstance.
[03:53:33.069 --> 03:53:40.294]  These and other closely guarded gun caching secrets are guaranteed to keep your weapons safe and out of sight when the going gets tough.
[03:53:40.294 --> 03:53:40.994]  But listen up.
[03:53:40.994 --> 03:53:47.238]  For security reasons, the Hide Your Guns book and even the website may disappear without warning at any time.
[03:53:47.238 --> 03:53:49.080]  Go to hideyourguns.com.
[03:53:49.080 --> 03:53:51.241]  That's hideyourguns.com.
[03:53:51.241 --> 03:53:51.741]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[03:53:51.741 --> 03:53:53.623]  Before they come for your guns.
[03:53:53.623 --> 03:53:54.243]  Hideyourguns.com.
[03:53:54.243 --> 03:53:54.823]  Right now.
[03:54:14.025 --> 03:54:15.866]  So you heard Obama.
[03:54:15.866 --> 03:54:23.111]  He said, uh, this whole thing is brought to you by Goldman Sachs, one of the key central banks robbing everybody.
[03:54:23.111 --> 03:54:27.193]  And don't worry, because even if you don't laugh, they're making their money.
[03:54:27.193 --> 03:54:28.454]  Just an arrogant message.
[03:54:28.454 --> 03:54:31.996]  And he also went on to joke about drones killing people.
[03:54:31.996 --> 03:54:33.077]  It's not a laughing matter.
[03:54:33.077 --> 03:54:35.779]  Even if it was a righteous war, it's totally illegal.
[03:54:35.779 --> 03:54:40.502]  But even if it was righteous, you don't joke about the fact that they kill whole families who are innocent.
[03:54:41.633 --> 03:54:48.396]  But it's a big joke to him, and it's a big joke to Bush, because the ruling class relishes the fact that they get to rape you.
[03:54:48.396 --> 03:54:51.137]  They relish that they're lawless and above the law.
[03:54:51.137 --> 03:54:52.398]  They love it.
[03:54:52.398 --> 03:54:59.000]  And all over the country, they're running ads similar to this one to intimidate taxpayers, people who are bankrupt.
[03:54:59.000 --> 03:55:00.761]  Nice car, nice house.
[03:55:00.761 --> 03:55:01.521]  We're God.
[03:55:01.521 --> 03:55:02.262]  We're the government.
[03:55:02.262 --> 03:55:04.102]  We're watching you.
[03:55:04.102 --> 03:55:05.663]  You're just a little slave.
[03:55:05.663 --> 03:55:07.224]  We've used your money to take over.
[03:55:08.143 --> 03:55:13.289]  And hey, we don't care if you don't laugh because we're going to rape you one way or the other.
[03:55:14.099 --> 03:55:15.380]  Your name is Tom.
[03:55:15.380 --> 03:55:17.402]  You live just off of 5th Street.
[03:55:17.402 --> 03:55:18.683]  Nice car, Tom.
[03:55:18.683 --> 03:55:19.563]  Nice house.
[03:55:19.563 --> 03:55:26.248]  What's not so nice is you owe Pennsylvania $4,212 in back taxes.
[03:55:26.248 --> 03:55:27.409]  Listen, Tom.
[03:55:27.409 --> 03:55:29.030]  We can make this easy.
[03:55:29.030 --> 03:55:35.475]  Pay online by June 18th, and we'll skip your penalty and take half off your interest.
[03:55:35.475 --> 03:55:38.818]  Because, Tom, we do know who you are.
[03:55:40.111 --> 03:55:42.894]  Find us before we find you.
[03:55:42.894 --> 03:55:44.215]  That is terrorism.
[03:55:44.215 --> 03:55:46.517]  That is taking your tax money and running ads like that.
[03:55:46.517 --> 03:55:59.389]  See, it was public service announcements forever about tattle on your neighbor of their smoking pot or spanking their kids or, you know, oh the government was being reasonable telling us to tattle and now they're just saying we're watching you with a satellite.
[03:55:59.389 --> 03:56:00.109]  We know who you are.
[03:56:00.109 --> 03:56:01.471]  We're going to take everything you've got.
[03:56:02.111 --> 03:56:07.540]  Some other news that you can read up at GCNlive.com that are key stories today.
[03:56:07.540 --> 03:56:14.351]  FDIC shut seven more banks at a cost of over seven billion dollars.
[03:56:15.589 --> 03:56:17.631]  Here's another key article.
[03:56:17.631 --> 03:56:24.936]  Corporate media plays down pro-illegal immigration thugs who terrorize Santa Cruz, setting fire to buildings and attacking.
[03:56:24.936 --> 03:56:28.639]  That's all detailed up there at GCNlive.com.
[03:56:28.639 --> 03:56:29.500]  Here's another one.
[03:56:29.500 --> 03:56:32.302]  Al-Qaeda terror tape proven fraudulent once again.
[03:56:32.302 --> 03:56:43.030]  An Israeli front group who's done it before put out the fake tape within hours of the botched Tinker Toy bomb, car bomb in Times Square.
[03:56:43.030 --> 03:56:45.092]  You can find out about all of that
[03:56:45.932 --> 03:56:47.854]  Uh, again at GCNLive.com.
[03:56:47.854 --> 03:56:53.738]  Another one here, Bank of America hit with Mark of the Beast graffiti, a Kurt Nemo story.
[03:56:53.738 --> 03:56:57.221]  Also at GCNLive.com.
[03:56:57.221 --> 03:57:03.206]  Here's another one, Goldman Sachs concedes case for restraining the banks.
[03:57:03.206 --> 03:57:04.187]  Yeah, but the way that that
[03:57:05.182 --> 03:57:14.569]  But again, the actual banking legislation doesn't restrain them, and we didn't have time to really get into all that today, but tomorrow I will cover it.
[03:57:14.569 --> 03:57:16.050]  Here's some of it.
[03:57:16.050 --> 03:57:23.376]  Power to collect any information from any other agency, including state government agencies, given in superiority in scope to all investigators.
[03:57:24.315 --> 03:57:26.716]  Number two, mandate companies who pose a threat to the U.S.
[03:57:26.716 --> 03:57:34.358]  financial system, which could be widely applied to almost anything, to register FIRA and submit to FIRA risk management policies.
[03:57:34.358 --> 03:57:36.179]  And again, the big banks write those policies.
[03:57:36.179 --> 03:57:40.260]  Mandate record keeping on all private financial entities with no limitations on what government may require.
[03:57:40.820 --> 03:57:42.483]  Monitor all financial services.
[03:57:42.483 --> 03:57:51.196]  Promulgate regulations to relinquish heightened risk-based capital leverage and liquidity requirements that increase on a graduated basis for certain bank holding companies.
[03:57:51.196 --> 03:57:55.682]  Totally arbitrary with no guarantee that the real problems like Goldman Sachs won't be let off the hook.
[03:57:56.403 --> 03:58:04.266]  That's like that stimulus package they passed last year, supposedly restricted CEO pay, but it all had loopholes and waivers for all the big companies.
[03:58:04.266 --> 03:58:04.766]  6.
[03:58:04.766 --> 03:58:06.947]  Regulate derivatives as hedge funds.
[03:58:06.947 --> 03:58:10.048]  They are so complex, however, that loopholes will surely abound.

[03:58:35.182 --> 03:58:39.125]  Everything you do in real time, no more Fourth Amendment or Fifth Amendment.
[03:58:39.125 --> 03:58:40.406]  Great job, crew!
[03:58:40.406 --> 03:58:41.286]  Back live tomorrow.
