[00:00.000 --> 00:18.160]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:18.160 --> 00:23.440]  Over 20 years ago, Alex Jones created the media platform called Infowars, and in the
[00:23.440 --> 00:29.960]  decade since, it's grown into a truly remarkable institution with over 200 radio affiliates.
[00:29.960 --> 00:35.880]  Tens of millions of unique website visitors monthly, and a 24-7 live news TV channel broadcasting
[00:35.880 --> 00:38.760]  from state-of-the-art studios in Austin, Texas.
[00:38.760 --> 00:44.040]  Infowars has become the most trusted independent news source in the country, dedicated to delivering
[00:44.040 --> 00:50.760]  breaking news, live coverage of special events, and exclusive reports you won't find anywhere else.
[00:50.760 --> 00:54.600]  While the old-guard media struggles to maintain supremacy in a landscape
[00:54.600 --> 01:01.160]  brought by innovation and technology, Infowars has been at the forefront of the information revolution.
[01:01.160 --> 01:07.080]  From 8 million radio listeners, over 2 million YouTube subscribers, or the billions of views
[01:07.080 --> 01:13.800]  of our online content, Infowars proves dominant in every facet of media we enter.
[01:13.800 --> 01:19.400]  For the hardest-hitting reports, uncompromising analysis for high-profile interviews and bombshell
[01:19.400 --> 01:26.280]  revelations accept no substitutes. Demand truth. Demand Infowars.
[01:27.960 --> 01:30.760]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[01:38.120 --> 01:41.640]  They're trying to shoot down Ronnie Jackson right now with a bunch of made-up crap,
[01:41.640 --> 01:46.440]  but when he worked for Obama, he was the best White House physician since
[01:46.440 --> 01:54.600]  it was invented. But now he's the devil. What a diversion, what a distraction trying to fix the
[01:54.600 --> 02:02.120]  broken VA. Comey's hired a very slimy criminal lawyer that tells us a lot, and we now know
[02:02.120 --> 02:07.640]  there's a special class of people. We already knew about this, and infrastructure protection
[02:08.200 --> 02:13.800]  rolled out under the Patriot Act. But special government employee is the term.
[02:13.800 --> 02:20.680]  For someone that has security clearances can get in all your business, but isn't in the government
[02:20.680 --> 02:26.360]  and isn't paid. So we're going to be breaking that down today. Oh, and Comey's saying, oh,
[02:26.360 --> 02:31.320]  I didn't leak secret stuff. It was secret. I gave it to someone else to do it. Well,
[02:31.320 --> 02:35.640]  he should know as the FBI former director that that makes him more guilty. It makes it more
[02:35.640 --> 02:42.040]  premeditated. Remember, he said in Congress, we ought to pull these clips up. He said, well,
[02:42.040 --> 02:49.160]  I felt the public needed to know about this. But now he's saying, oh, he just gave it to a friend and
[02:49.800 --> 02:55.560]  who just was a little special government agent within a university, a little spy, and he leaked it.
[03:00.200 --> 03:03.640]  I keep using the Scarface analogies because there's so many of them
[03:04.920 --> 03:10.360]  where the corrupt drug dealers begging Tony Montana to kill him. And he goes, oh, please Tony,
[03:10.360 --> 03:15.720]  I never killed anybody in my life. I never did nothing. I never. And he goes, no, you just
[03:15.720 --> 03:23.720]  have somebody else do it for you. Oh, please don't kill me. Please. I'm not going to kill you. Oh,
[03:23.720 --> 03:31.240]  thank you. Manning shoot that piece. Now we're not talking about physical violence here. We're
[03:31.240 --> 03:37.960]  talking about the analogy, the allegory. Like we use Star Wars allegories or parallels they fit
[03:37.960 --> 03:42.440]  in everything. You can use Scarface for that. It's kind of a game. Me and some of my buddies
[03:42.440 --> 03:49.320]  years ago would play in politics, just comparing it to Scarface because Comey's like, I never leaked
[03:49.320 --> 03:55.320]  nothing in my life. I never did anything. No, you just had somebody else do it for you.
[03:58.920 --> 04:06.200]  It's like a mafia boss ordering their capo to have a soldier go kill somebody. Well,
[04:06.200 --> 04:14.360]  the mafia don, if he gets caught doing that, he gets the death penalty because it's premeditated
[04:14.360 --> 04:27.240]  Capital One murder. A capital offense. I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot the deputy.
[04:27.240 --> 04:37.240]  Freedom came my way one day. I was starting out of town when I saw Sheriff John Brown coming to
[04:37.240 --> 04:48.200]  shoot me down. So I shot. I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot. No deputy. It's always great
[04:48.200 --> 04:53.080]  allegories and parallels to Bob Marley music as well. Because they're all about the legends and
[04:53.080 --> 04:57.880]  ethos and our types of life that we know are so true and that we see expressed in the real world
[04:57.880 --> 05:04.200]  daily. We'll be back. President Donald Trump says the US is negotiating for the release of American
[05:04.200 --> 05:08.840]  hostages in North Korea. President Trump was asked during a joint press conference with the
[05:08.840 --> 05:14.200]  Japanese Prime Minister whether or not the three Americans release would be a precondition for
[05:14.200 --> 05:18.920]  sitting down with the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Trump said his administration was fighting
[05:18.920 --> 05:24.200]  very diligently for the safe return of the three captives, adding, we are doing our very best.
[05:24.200 --> 05:28.920]  As you know, they've been there a long time in its harsh treatment. Trump noted the case of
[05:28.920 --> 05:34.360]  Otto Warmbier, the American student who died after being released last year by Pyongyang.
[05:34.360 --> 05:40.760]  The Associated Press quotes a senior White House official who says CIA director Mike Pompeo discussed
[05:40.760 --> 05:46.120]  the hostages during his trip to North Korea over Easter weekend. The official says Mr. Trump is
[05:46.120 --> 05:51.160]  hopeful they'll be released soon. The president says the face-to-face with Kim Jong-un will likely
[05:51.160 --> 05:55.640]  take place in early June, but he added that if the meeting is not going to be fruitful,
[05:55.640 --> 06:22.680]  he will respectfully leave. We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center
[06:22.680 --> 06:26.520]  in the heart of the resistance. It's Alex Jones.
[06:39.000 --> 06:40.600]  I am extremely frustrated.
[06:44.040 --> 06:45.400]  I am extremely upset
[06:45.400 --> 07:02.840]  with myself for not having a way to properly quantify, break down, lay out
[07:04.680 --> 07:11.480]  just how insane and evil this situation is we face. Now there's great positivity to that
[07:11.480 --> 07:16.200]  because the evils here, the corruptions here, the bad things are going on and good people
[07:16.200 --> 07:20.840]  admitting it's happening and saying no and getting out of their comfort zone
[07:25.400 --> 07:26.440]  is the way to stop it.
[07:26.440 --> 07:40.600]  Yesterday I spent 10 minutes on one story that I could have spent four hours on
[07:41.240 --> 07:45.640]  and I got all this new breaking news and I just can't help but go back to it.
[07:49.080 --> 07:51.640]  And then I think about all the new revelations of
[07:51.640 --> 08:00.040]  social services all over the world and the police in many areas, especially liberal and
[08:00.040 --> 08:07.800]  socialist and globalist areas, kidnapping children, selling them into sex slavery,
[08:09.080 --> 08:13.720]  and it just gets worse from there. And it's now in the London Independent,
[08:14.360 --> 08:17.560]  the Telegraph and other publications, right about reporting on it yesterday,
[08:17.560 --> 08:24.920]  in Telford, major town, major city, grooming scandal, former social services boss, local
[08:24.920 --> 08:30.200]  lawmakers exposed as pedophiles and they would grab the kids from their parents and then give
[08:30.200 --> 08:35.080]  them to the pedophile groups or they would cover up for the pedophile groups, mainly Muslims,
[08:36.680 --> 08:40.440]  operating giant industrial operations. Now you've all heard about grooming scandals,
[08:40.440 --> 08:48.440]  there's hundreds of them. Every town basically is run by pedophiles, almost every town, who then
[08:48.440 --> 08:55.160]  bring in the Muslims who are like the Renfields to Dracula, who go out and procure. That's why
[08:55.160 --> 09:01.400]  the globalists love the Muslim culture because it is about harems, chained up women in sex
[09:01.400 --> 09:06.200]  dungeon, that's what a harem is. But you know when you're growing up watching Saturday morning
[09:06.200 --> 09:10.600]  cartoons and Bugs Bunny falls into a harem, it's a bunch of pretty girl rabbits sitting around on
[09:10.600 --> 09:25.080]  pink pillows. The propaganda is everywhere and it just goes on and on and on and when you break
[09:25.080 --> 09:30.600]  through one level of it, it just falls into this subterranean nightmare and then it ties into Penn
[09:30.600 --> 09:35.240]  State president indicted for knowing about the pedophilia and covering it up and obviously it
[09:35.240 --> 09:41.400]  goes way deeper than that and just all of it, the industrial scale and the Vatican and the deputy
[09:41.400 --> 09:47.960]  pope, the number two guy was in the news for two days, he reportedly trafficked over 100 boys
[09:49.960 --> 09:57.560]  for blackmail and the Vatican and where is that now? Where is it now? So we're going to be getting
[09:57.560 --> 10:07.720]  into that some, it's just one level to this. Here's another article, BBC, Establishment,
[10:08.280 --> 10:14.440]  how bacteria are changing your mood and they admit that a lot of depression is linked to yeast,
[10:14.440 --> 10:21.320]  candida, mold and bad toxic bacteria in the gut from pesticides precipitating and knocking out the
[10:21.320 --> 10:30.440]  good bacteria and then yeast and mold slime walls come in and take over and of course medical doctors
[10:30.440 --> 10:38.280]  that did studies decades ago got demonized for saying they're finding antibodies for measles,
[10:38.280 --> 10:42.520]  mumps, rubella and other things in the guts of children that have been vaccinated and they've
[10:42.520 --> 10:49.400]  directly linked it to the brain damage and the autism amongst other things. Even the New York
[10:49.400 --> 10:58.040]  Times admits that 20 years after I had scientist and nutritionist and gut experts on telling you
[10:58.040 --> 11:07.400]  that, this is all known. But when I talked about Myco ZX a few years ago, that is a super powerful
[11:07.400 --> 11:14.120]  concentrated herbal formula of known compounds to destroy the slime walls in the intestines created
[11:14.120 --> 11:20.200]  by yeast, mold and candida, they take over your gut, they put in their own wall between your
[11:20.200 --> 11:27.080]  intestine wall and the food, the nutrients and they then extract it, they then release toxins,
[11:27.080 --> 11:31.880]  they take a dump in your stomach, in your intestines, upper and lower intestines, start to get gross
[11:31.880 --> 11:39.720]  here and this is the number one thing linked to depression and health issues and skin issues and
[11:39.720 --> 11:44.600]  they know it and when we came out and talked about this, they demonize us all over mainstream media
[11:44.600 --> 11:50.600]  and make fun of us claiming the headlines were, Jones invents a fake problem in the gut to sell
[11:50.600 --> 11:54.840]  you something. It's like David Hogg on C-Spain, he goes, Jones says that there's chemicals in the
[11:54.840 --> 12:02.440]  water hurting us and then he goes to a commercial for water filters. Interesting. Oh, you're such a
[12:02.440 --> 12:09.320]  genius Hogg, we tried to sneak it past the viewers. We say you need water filtration, it's the number
[12:09.320 --> 12:15.160]  one thing you can do because of the thousands in some cases, usually hundreds of chemicals and
[12:15.160 --> 12:22.840]  derivatives in the water supply, the drug runoff, the atrazine, the fluoride, the mercury, the lead,
[12:23.640 --> 12:32.280]  the, it goes on and on. Yes, I filter my water. Yes, I have air filtration in my house. In fact,
[12:32.280 --> 12:35.480]  I think you get the air filter turned on over there and I don't think it's turned on right now, thanks.
[12:35.480 --> 12:43.560]  Yes, we sell you the lifestyle we're trying to live that's a better one, a healthier one, absolutely.
[12:43.560 --> 12:47.080]  We want to fund ourselves promoting health, promoting things that are good
[12:50.120 --> 12:54.760]  and then sell things that are moral and good that we use in the 360 win. Instead, you watch
[12:54.760 --> 13:00.760]  the very channels criticizing us, attacking us, Comedy Central, Co-Bear, NBC, CBS,
[13:00.760 --> 13:06.760]  they will sit there with literal serotonin reuptake inhibitor ads during the breaks and
[13:06.760 --> 13:11.000]  all these other drug ads of things they admit can cause you to commit suicide, become a mass
[13:11.000 --> 13:15.720]  murder, you name it, that eat holes in your brain that cause all sorts of problems linked to massive
[13:15.720 --> 13:24.120]  cancer. They're selling you pure death and not telling you in hundreds of studies something
[13:24.120 --> 13:29.160]  like 5-HTP. That's just a chemical that's in the brain naturally. You can buy for 20 bucks
[13:29.160 --> 13:34.040]  in all the studies is way better for your quote mood and doesn't kill you like these drugs.
[13:38.360 --> 13:38.600]  Now,
[13:44.680 --> 13:46.680]  I got so much to hit here, we're going to hit it all today,
[13:46.680 --> 13:54.360]  but I thought that I would just
[13:59.240 --> 14:04.440]  point out that it's next year's news today, it's next decade's news today, it's the news
[14:05.000 --> 14:09.160]  20 years from now today because this stuff's already all known. They were having human animal
[14:09.160 --> 14:15.160]  clones 25 years ago. They had human clones 30 plus years ago, it's in the mainline literature.
[14:15.160 --> 14:19.800]  They just kill them at the embryonic level and if you believe they really kill them in the test
[14:19.800 --> 14:25.400]  tube, I got a bridge I want to sell you and some oceanfront property in Arizona and from my front
[14:25.400 --> 14:32.760]  port you can see the sea. So absolutely, I'm going to plug right up front since this is it
[14:32.760 --> 14:38.440]  back in the news. Myco ZX was sold out for six months, it's so hard to procure the compounds
[14:38.440 --> 14:42.360]  and make sure they pass California standards, it's almost impossible, it's designed that way,
[14:42.360 --> 14:47.560]  but this last batch did. That was everything you get a whole food says doesn't pass California
[14:47.560 --> 14:53.240]  standards, but we're able to do it. Jeff Bezos doesn't. It's now available back in stock,
[14:53.240 --> 14:58.280]  the other side of the paradigm for a probiotic, but this is to knock out the bad yeast mold,
[14:59.560 --> 15:03.880]  Candida, the slime walls and it is dramatic and everything in it's healthy and really,
[15:03.880 --> 15:07.480]  really good for your body in many other ways. It's very concentrated, there's about three
[15:07.480 --> 15:11.880]  regimens, do this every few months, take it for a week and it's changed so many people's lives.
[15:12.760 --> 15:17.480]  Bodies is back in stock, the ultimate, strongest formula for my research out there,

[18:59.960 --> 19:05.320]  Infowars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[19:05.320 --> 19:10.680]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[19:10.680 --> 19:16.680]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[19:17.320 --> 19:23.320]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[19:23.320 --> 19:28.760]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses. They began studying this effect in published
[19:28.760 --> 19:33.720]  trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting,
[19:33.720 --> 19:37.560]  chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[19:37.560 --> 19:42.440]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine. In fact,
[19:42.440 --> 19:46.920]  current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase,
[19:46.920 --> 19:51.400]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[19:51.960 --> 19:54.520]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[19:54.520 --> 19:59.400]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[20:03.240 --> 20:13.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:13.400 --> 20:30.200]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[20:30.200 --> 20:31.800]  It's Alex Jones.
[20:33.960 --> 20:39.400]  We keep telling them that if they accept this blood money, they're against the children.
[20:39.400 --> 20:45.320]  They're against the people who are dying and that there's no other way to put it at this point.
[20:45.320 --> 20:51.240]  You're either funding the killers or you are standing with the children, the children who
[20:51.240 --> 20:53.480]  have no money. We don't have jobs.
[20:57.000 --> 21:01.080]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[21:01.080 --> 21:11.880]  Let me just mention last time this is cell phone radiation. This is your brain on cell
[21:11.880 --> 21:18.680]  phone and wireless radiation. Any questions? This message is brought to you by infowars.com
[21:18.680 --> 21:21.640]  in the hopes that if you're going to fry your brain and body with radiation,
[21:21.640 --> 21:24.840]  that's your business. For God's sake, let's protect our children.
[21:24.840 --> 21:35.080]  We are back live. I want to air this Harrison Smith report that's important about the UK cutting
[21:35.080 --> 21:41.160]  down US trees to quote, stop global warming. I'm not kidding. That's how insane the fraud is.
[21:42.040 --> 21:45.640]  Then we're going to come back and get into the massive news where China is now
[21:46.680 --> 21:50.600]  using social credit score to not let people travel or fly on airplanes.
[21:50.600 --> 21:54.040]  They're going to bring this total control system here. That's coming up in the next
[21:54.040 --> 21:59.800]  segment. Here's Harrison's report. Today is April 24th, 2018. According to the Guardian,
[21:59.800 --> 22:05.960]  the UK has been powered without coal for three days in a row, setting a new record and underlining
[22:05.960 --> 22:11.800]  the polluting fuels rapid decline. This was seen as a big victory in the fight against
[22:11.800 --> 22:16.280]  global warming or what is now called climate change because they're trying to phase out
[22:16.280 --> 22:24.200]  coal as it is a carbon producing pollutant. But there is a slight catch as the Guardian reports,
[22:24.200 --> 22:29.160]  without this fossil fuel, nearly a third of Britain's electricity was supplied by gas,
[22:29.160 --> 22:33.800]  followed by wind farms and nuclear on around a quarter each. But the most important part is
[22:33.800 --> 22:40.680]  this next line. The rest came from biomass burned at Drax power station in North Yorkshire.
[22:40.680 --> 22:48.280]  Now, biomass is the fancy term for any sort of organic compound that is burned for fuel.
[22:49.000 --> 22:55.960]  This is presented as a earth friendly alternative to coal. But if we look in just a little bit
[22:55.960 --> 23:03.480]  deeper, we find that that is not the case. And here's the reason why. Huge areas of hardwood
[23:03.480 --> 23:08.920]  forests in the state of Virginia are being chainsawed to create biomass energy in Britain as
[23:08.920 --> 23:13.960]  the government attempts to reach targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in an effort to tackle
[23:13.960 --> 23:20.760]  climate change. So that means that instead of using coal in their effort to do away with coal,
[23:20.760 --> 23:26.920]  which has been branded as a bad fuel source, they have turned to cutting down old growth,
[23:26.920 --> 23:33.800]  slow growth force in Virginia, chopping up those trees into tiny pellets and shipping those to
[23:33.800 --> 23:40.840]  the UK to be burned in their power plants. Now, on its face, this is a ridiculous proposal. The
[23:40.840 --> 23:47.400]  idea that using coal is somehow more impactful to the environment than cutting down slow growth,
[23:47.400 --> 23:52.920]  old growth force in Virginia and using that material to burn, it doesn't make any sense
[23:52.920 --> 23:58.840]  on its face. But as you look more into it, the more ridiculous it becomes. The power station
[23:58.840 --> 24:03.880]  giant claims that burning pellets instead of coal reduces carbon emissions by more than 80%.
[24:04.520 --> 24:10.520]  However, dispatches, which is a program on Channel 4, BBC's Channel 4, conducted a simple
[24:10.520 --> 24:15.320]  experiment at a laboratory at the University of Nottingham to compare the carbon dioxide emitted
[24:15.320 --> 24:21.080]  when burning wood pellets similar to those used by Drax instead of coal. It found that to burn
[24:21.080 --> 24:25.000]  an amount of wood pellets that would generate the same amount of electricity as coal, it would
[24:25.000 --> 24:31.400]  actually produce roughly 8% more carbon. So that's just on its surface. They tell you that burning
[24:31.400 --> 24:39.560]  this biomass will reduce less CO2, but studies at the Nottingham University have revealed that
[24:39.560 --> 24:44.760]  that's not true. In fact, burning the wood pellets produces more CO2, and that's not even considering
[24:44.760 --> 24:51.640]  the transportation and the cutting down of the trees, which themselves act as a filter to get
[24:51.640 --> 25:00.280]  rid of the CO2. However, it doesn't end there. It actually gets even more ridiculous. On the
[25:00.280 --> 25:04.360]  question of Drax claims that by burning wood instead of coal, it reduces carbon emissions by
[25:04.360 --> 25:10.520]  more than 80%, cost-admitted, it doesn't include emissions from its chimneys. We don't count that,
[25:10.520 --> 25:15.240]  he says. The government doesn't count that. It doesn't include stack emissions because if we're
[25:15.240 --> 25:21.560]  sourcing sustainable biomass from working forests, where this is more growth than is being harbored
[25:21.560 --> 25:28.120]  or harvested, we see the carbon being reabsorbed. So I tried to wrap my head around this, and I
[25:28.120 --> 25:34.040]  really can't. I guess what he's saying is because they're using trees that they've chopped down
[25:34.040 --> 25:42.680]  and chopped up as biomass, somehow the CO2 is going to be reabsorbed by the new trees that
[25:42.680 --> 25:49.320]  they plant. But if you just chop down trees, then they aren't taking in as much CO2. You're just
[25:49.320 --> 25:56.200]  taking things that typically remove CO2, and you're burning those, creating more CO2, but it's okay
[25:56.200 --> 26:04.440]  because using that sustainable biomass means that the trees will grow more and absorb more CO2.
[26:04.440 --> 26:09.720]  It literally doesn't make any sense. It's a policy that's costing taxpayers more than 700
[26:09.720 --> 26:14.760]  million pounds per year through a levy on their electricity bills. That means that people in
[26:14.760 --> 26:21.880]  the UK are paying an extra 700 million dollars in order to get off of coal and onto this biomass,
[26:21.880 --> 26:30.440]  which again sounds good, but most definitely isn't. So this alone highlights how the goals
[26:30.440 --> 26:37.880]  of the left, the goals purported by the left, such as trying to tamp down on carbon emissions,
[26:37.880 --> 26:43.160]  trying to prevent global warming, trying to prevent climate change. In reality, they're just
[26:43.160 --> 26:49.960]  scams of the highest order. They are preying on people's desire to do good, on people's desire
[26:49.960 --> 26:56.040]  to do something to help save the earth, and they're taking that desire and they're warping it to make
[26:56.040 --> 27:01.320]  money. They're taking advantage of that desire to sell a product and fill their own pockets.
[27:01.320 --> 27:05.720]  The people selling these forests are making money. The people shipping the material
[27:05.720 --> 27:10.120]  are making money. The people burning the material are making money, and it's mostly being paid for
[27:10.120 --> 27:16.360]  by the UK taxpayers by a levy on their electricity bills. So they don't have a choice. They are
[27:16.360 --> 27:21.080]  going to be, this money is going to be taken from them, whether they want it to be or not.
[27:21.960 --> 27:27.320]  So that's what we mean. That's what I mean when I say I don't believe in climate change or I don't
[27:27.320 --> 27:32.920]  believe in global warming. It's not that I don't understand the concept of greenhouse gases and
[27:32.920 --> 27:38.680]  of sunlight being trapped and of the heat going up and melting the poles. I get all of that. The
[27:38.680 --> 27:45.400]  issue is that the solutions being proposed are not only not helping the problem that we're being
[27:45.400 --> 27:55.320]  faced with, they actually make it worse. And in many instances, even just questioning the efficacy
[27:55.320 --> 28:04.360]  of these programs is tantamount to being a religious heretic. It's, you're called a denier
[28:04.360 --> 28:13.320]  if you don't believe exactly what the elites tell us is happening with the climate. And despite the
[28:13.320 --> 28:19.400]  fact that what they tell us changes rather often, if you want to talk about the fact that China says
[28:19.400 --> 28:25.240]  it's producing billions and billions of gallons of rain by manipulating the climate, they say that
[28:25.240 --> 28:30.040]  doesn't matter. It's really just pollution and really you just need to give us your money so we
[28:30.040 --> 28:34.600]  can go take care of it. You say, all right, you believe them and they end up cutting down
[28:35.720 --> 28:44.680]  slow growth, old growth forests in Virginia to just to trick you. They're just tricking you
[28:44.680 --> 28:50.760]  into giving them money to continue to destroy the earth while patting themselves on the back
[28:50.760 --> 28:56.280]  and pretending like they're doing something good. For Infowars.com, this has been Harrison Smith.

[33:20.840 --> 33:32.840]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[33:41.240 --> 33:47.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live. We are broadcasting worldwide. It was four years ago
[33:47.160 --> 33:54.440]  that Paul Joseph Watson and myself, Alex Jones, covered it live on air and wrote three news
[33:54.440 --> 34:01.000]  stories in one month about China announcing a new social credit score that would be tied into not
[34:01.000 --> 34:05.480]  just the internet, not just your job, not just your travel, not just your national ID card,
[34:07.080 --> 34:14.200]  but into millions of cameras all over China tracking your every movement
[34:14.200 --> 34:19.320]  and your smartphone tracking your every movement integrated in together.
[34:21.800 --> 34:27.400]  And now it's being reported Chinese journalists ban from flying, buying property under new social
[34:27.400 --> 34:34.760]  credit score system. They have a name for that. It's called the Mark of the Beast.
[34:37.160 --> 34:43.720]  Total control. And they're now testing it in 16 cities. They can scan the entire population
[34:43.720 --> 34:53.240]  of China's faces in one second, 1.3 billion. We call it the Mark of the Beast. You shall buy
[34:53.240 --> 35:04.120]  and or sell without it on a global scale. They call it Skynet. And if you read my book to sit
[35:04.120 --> 35:09.800]  into tyranny, 2002, it's free online, out of print. I just stopped printing them after we sold
[35:09.800 --> 35:13.320]  120,000 of them. I don't know why I did that. I thought, well, I'll just put out for free. And
[35:13.320 --> 35:18.920]  then no one cared once it was free. Everyone bought it when it cost $15. But it's free online,
[35:18.920 --> 35:26.760]  descent into tyranny. And I was on Scripps and other places. You can go there and you can read
[35:28.840 --> 35:35.640]  where I show the declassified DARPA program from 1977 declassified in 2000,
[35:35.640 --> 35:43.240]  declassified the next year. And they call the global grid between smart dust on the ground,
[35:43.240 --> 35:48.360]  the internet, the internet of things, aircraft, the satellites, the surveillance cameras,
[35:49.080 --> 35:57.800]  the digital number to buy and sell. Guess what they call it in the DARPA blend? Skynet.
[35:57.800 --> 36:11.000]  And the common Chinese call it Skynet. And it's the worldwide system. China is where
[36:11.000 --> 36:15.320]  all the big corporations are moving. Apple's moving there. Two months ago, Reuters reported
[36:15.320 --> 36:23.720]  they're giving them the keys to everyone's Apple ID and control of the Apple Cloud and the Apple
[36:23.720 --> 36:44.680]  executive, Mr. Cook, said in the article, he said, well, it's normal when you move your business to
[36:44.680 --> 36:51.000]  China that you let the government in and you put their agents in key positions of control.
[36:51.000 --> 36:59.000]  And of course, why did they do it? Because you get 0% tax in China if you're a major
[36:59.000 --> 37:05.560]  corporation, if you move there, zero. And I harped on that quite a bit, did not,
[37:05.560 --> 37:10.200]  because we were at 40%. China was at 15. We wouldn't have anybody headquartered here because of it.
[37:10.200 --> 37:15.880]  Trump lowered us to 15. To be fair, Ernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, all the regular
[37:15.880 --> 37:23.080]  kleptocrats, love China zero percent tax because they're good globalists. But when Trump wanted
[37:23.080 --> 37:32.440]  15%, it was about hurting the poor. And Falun Gong, Buddhist, about to have their organs taken,
[37:32.440 --> 37:40.760]  don't know what it's like to be alive. I'm liberal. My wife swindles universities, though.
[37:40.760 --> 37:51.080]  I bankrupt stuff. I live in $3 million houses, $100,000 cars, but why people don't know what
[37:51.080 --> 37:58.440]  it's like to be poor? Listen to me, I got Einstein looking here. It's called a gimmick.
[38:00.120 --> 38:06.440]  Again, I honeymooned in Soviet Russia in the 70s, all day knew how to treat a Christian there.
[38:06.440 --> 38:15.480]  We almost had those Russians down. We'll get them again. No, don't worry. I'm a big man. I'm
[38:15.480 --> 38:19.960]  plenty. Here, here, here. Let's hear him say white people don't know what it's like to be poor. Do
[38:19.960 --> 38:32.440]  we have that? Do you know? So there you go. China assigns every citizen a social credit score to
[38:32.440 --> 38:38.120]  identify who is and who isn't trustworthy. Can we search engine info wars.com? Click web

[40:08.360 --> 40:17.960]  Now, how are they going to sell it? How are they going to push it? How are they going to
[40:21.400 --> 40:30.040]  get it through on everybody? When we come back, I'll break it down. But the AP this week,
[40:30.040 --> 40:40.440]  Associated Press, Hillary Rodham Clinton, good old Hillary Rodham Clinton, AP, Hillary Rodham Clinton
[40:44.120 --> 40:47.560]  and of course now a bunch of other publications
[40:47.560 --> 40:56.840]  including Jim Acosta are calling for it to be illegal
[41:00.840 --> 41:05.480]  to criticize mainstream media. They want it to be a hate crime. They've already kind of done that
[41:05.480 --> 41:10.360]  in Europe and you think, oh, they'll never get that done. Oh, really? It's a perfect storm. The
[41:10.360 --> 41:15.160]  old dying media, the corrupt dying elements of the government, the big global corporations having
[41:15.160 --> 41:19.320]  their carte blanche taken away from them as nationalism and common sense and free market
[41:19.320 --> 41:30.360]  and populism comes back. They're moving to shut us down right now. Meanwhile, FEC records indicate
[41:30.360 --> 41:37.240]  Hillary campaign illegally laundered $84 million. Oh, yeah. That's what they use the foundation for.
[41:39.320 --> 41:43.640]  Everybody's being careful here saying, indicating no, they're caught red-handed. That's what the
[41:43.640 --> 41:49.560]  foundation's for. And James Comey's gotten himself one of the slumiest criminal lawyers there is
[41:50.440 --> 41:54.200]  and he's been caught criminally leaking, but he says it's okay. He did it through
[41:55.320 --> 42:02.440]  a secret government agent that runs the university, a special government employees, what they're called.
[42:03.880 --> 42:06.680]  We're going to tell you all about that. We first broke that.
[42:06.680 --> 42:12.440]  17 years ago with the passage of the first Patriot Act, I'll tell you all about it.
[42:13.480 --> 42:20.200]  More than 3 million people have secret federal badges in America. I know some of them. They carry
[42:20.200 --> 42:26.120]  guns on airplanes, everything. They got their little federal ID card. They get to get it all
[42:26.120 --> 42:31.240]  the databases, everything else. And it's the auxiliary and it's the professors and it's the
[42:31.240 --> 42:36.920]  local leftist police chiefs, the local ADL, the local Southern Barbie Law Center. They're all
[42:37.640 --> 42:46.760]  secret federal officers. We'll tell you all about it when we come back. And they think they got you
[42:47.880 --> 42:53.000]  by the shorthairs, but I say they don't. I say truth will restore the republic.
[42:53.000 --> 42:57.240]  Spread the live links to the forewinds. Fill everybody with the broadcast. You are the only hope.
[42:57.240 --> 43:05.080]  In FullWarsLife is launching its newest product. We're really, really proud of it. It's a best

[43:59.400 --> 44:03.000]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60 plus products,
[44:03.000 --> 44:09.400]  we have it in FullWarsLife. It'd take hours. MycoZX Plus now has a lower price. It's stronger.
[44:09.400 --> 44:14.280]  It's the other equation in probiotics. It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[44:14.280 --> 44:19.720]  It's back in stock. The real red pill, it's been sold out for months. It's got the preglonone,
[44:19.720 --> 44:23.800]  that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body. Then it's got all the minerals and

[44:35.160 --> 44:39.720]  gargle. That's a spray you do. You can also swallow it. It's a supplement with iodine,
[44:39.720 --> 44:45.880]  super high quality silver and a lot more. Without you, we couldn't do it. So thank you all for
[44:45.880 --> 44:50.920]  remembering in FullWarsLife.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake,
[44:50.920 --> 44:54.600]  but it's other people that aren't awake and it's so essential to spread the word. Again,
[44:54.600 --> 44:57.560]  thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[45:00.040 --> 45:05.080]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of
[45:05.080 --> 45:09.320]  seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[45:09.320 --> 45:15.560]  to detoxify the body. That's why I'm introducing ZShield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[45:15.560 --> 45:21.320]  It's made in the USA. It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated
[45:21.320 --> 45:27.240]  with detoxifying the body and it supports the M4. It is a classical 360 win. This is the formula
[45:27.240 --> 45:32.040]  that I personally have been taking for over a year. And now we believe we have come as close to
[45:32.040 --> 45:36.520]  perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get. You owe it to yourself,
[45:36.520 --> 45:41.480]  you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that Patriots

[47:22.440 --> 47:25.720]  Roger Stone, former head of the Trump campaign, is here in town. He'll be in
[47:25.720 --> 47:30.360]  studio in the middle of the next hour and we have several other big guests I'll tell you about coming
[47:30.360 --> 47:36.600]  up. I've already mentioned some of the news but I want to burrow into some of the really big news
[47:36.600 --> 47:42.200]  here because there's just so many angles to all of this. Let me just mention some of this now.
[47:42.200 --> 47:49.000]  Blue Wave Fizzles as AP declares Republican winner of Arizona's special congressional
[47:49.000 --> 47:56.920]  election to be the Republican. We'll get to that. Tucker to GOP says run against openly extremist
[47:56.920 --> 48:03.480]  racist dims, not Hillary Clinton. Do I agree with that? I'll get into it in a minute.
[48:03.480 --> 48:10.200]  FEC records suggest Clinton campaign laundered 84 million in FullWars.com. Jamie White key article
[48:10.200 --> 48:19.880]  to get out. I changed the word suggest to indicate, document, show. Associated Press
[48:21.240 --> 48:26.520]  suggests criticizing journalists is hate speech, wanted banned. Paul Joseph Watson article,
[48:26.520 --> 48:32.360]  unbelievable. CNN's Acosta, there's video of this. Trump supporters don't have all their
[48:32.360 --> 48:39.880]  faculties goes on to say that Trump's threatening journalist and going to get them hurt that it's
[48:39.880 --> 48:44.040]  hate speech. And then another article does the First Amendment protect conspiracy theorist.
[48:45.560 --> 48:52.040]  The article calls me a cockroach from WBUR, lies about what I've said, twist everything,
[48:53.160 --> 48:56.680]  and then calls for my speech to be taken. But only as I'm a conspiracy theorist. See,
[48:56.680 --> 49:03.160]  because they label me that. And Hitler only said take Jews free speech. Meanwhile, Hillary went on
[49:03.160 --> 49:10.360]  F-laced tirade against Trump during 2016 debate prep. And the big news research, Google search
[49:10.360 --> 49:17.240]  manipulation can swing nearly 80% of undecided voters that in a new major study by the American
[49:17.240 --> 49:24.200]  Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology. That's basically DARPA. That group's 90% DARPA
[49:24.200 --> 49:31.400]  funded. So DARPA says, wow, Google can swing 80% of people by only showing negative search results.
[49:31.400 --> 49:36.680]  Do an Alex Jones search now. In the last year, and we have some of the internal contracts that
[49:36.680 --> 49:42.840]  Mike Cernovich got and Google admitted they were real, they were paying in one contract millions
[49:42.840 --> 49:47.800]  of dollars for people to just go downvote us everywhere and say they don't like us.
[49:52.120 --> 49:57.640]  To delist us, to drive info wars from the top and put nothing but lies and you go to YouTube,
[49:57.640 --> 50:06.040]  you go anywhere. It's all force fed. Similarly, you open up Spotify, the number one music service
[50:06.040 --> 50:12.520]  in the world. It pushes handmade his daughter about Christians oppressing women in a monotheistic
[50:12.520 --> 50:18.200]  system that makes them wear hoods over their heads. That's Islam. Then I go to YouTube. It's the top
[50:18.200 --> 50:22.840]  thing on there. I'm walking down the street last week in Austin. They have a display in a window
[50:22.840 --> 50:27.400]  about it. There's a billboard. The Christians are oppressing women. The Christians, the Christians,
[50:27.400 --> 50:32.760]  the Muslims are friends. That's just an example of how they give me all the CNN, ABC news, fake news
[50:32.760 --> 50:38.600]  on my iPhone feed that I don't ask for. It's just there. Turn my phone on. Everybody. It's
[50:38.600 --> 50:46.280]  everything at the top of the page is the garbage. It's the force feeding. Trying to drown out the
[50:46.280 --> 50:53.080]  reality until they're ready to report. Okay, China's arresting Buddhists and killing them good. And if
[50:53.080 --> 50:56.840]  you criticize the government, you won't be able to buy, sell or travel. And by the way, it's coming
[50:56.840 --> 51:02.600]  here. So shut your mouths and learn to shut up. And it's already happened. Most of the libertarian
[51:02.600 --> 51:07.240]  and conservative bloggers, they've lighten their stances. They've backed off. Oh, please don't
[51:07.240 --> 51:14.280]  demonetize me. And then YouTube doesn't demonetize them. And then the liberals that suddenly,
[51:14.280 --> 51:17.960]  a bunch of them get banned that are independent and then they stop. Okay, then they're back to
[51:17.960 --> 51:23.240]  being monetized until the next wave of conditioning and less and less. But everybody just holds on
[51:23.240 --> 51:27.880]  while there's less and less. Well, I'll still, I'll be the last person groveling and kissing
[51:27.880 --> 51:32.360]  butt and kissing their feet and doing whatever they say. So I can be on Twitter and Facebook and
[51:32.360 --> 51:41.720]  YouTube. I'll, I'll, I'll toe the line so I can keep my podcast going until you just know
[51:41.720 --> 51:47.320]  they're going to do it to everybody. They come to PewDiePie and say, you let us run your life,
[51:47.320 --> 51:52.200]  or we're going to demonetize you to shut you down. Then they start or Joe Rogan has me on
[51:52.200 --> 51:56.840]  number one podcast in history, doubling things ever done. They delisting. They don't let him
[51:56.840 --> 52:02.520]  promote it. A bunch of stuff happens. Hey, Joe, you don't have him back on. You don't have on what's
[52:02.520 --> 52:08.280]  number one, the two of us together. That's not how you win. You don't win the heavyweight bout by
[52:08.280 --> 52:14.440]  knocking the guy out. You win by rolling over. You don't win the race car race by actually winning.
[52:15.560 --> 52:19.960]  There's just the anointed ones and then you get patted on the head and then everybody plays along
[52:19.960 --> 52:25.960]  with it until there's a social score system in place on every front and everybody's by
[52:25.960 --> 52:31.560]  successive approximation sells out a little more and a little more and a little more and a little
[52:31.560 --> 52:37.960]  more until we have nothing and we're like communist China with a Skynet system that can predict
[52:37.960 --> 52:42.200]  everything we do, where we go, what we're going to buy before we even know we're going to do it.
[52:43.720 --> 52:49.080]  And that's the goal. Future predictability and future control. Because once you can predict
[52:49.080 --> 52:54.920]  the future, you can steer the stimuli to control the future. I first told you this 20 years ago.
[52:55.480 --> 52:59.960]  Two years ago, Google declassified out of their own archives their first meeting
[52:59.960 --> 53:09.560]  in 1997 before the formation with the NSA and the CIA. This was in Wired Magazine two years ago.
[53:11.720 --> 53:15.480]  Nico Acosta, the producer said, have you seen this is what you're saying? And I've searched it
[53:15.480 --> 53:19.720]  and they just admitted all this. He said, how'd you know that? And I said, well, I knew some
[53:19.720 --> 53:26.360]  insiders but and they admitted because when the NSA was going to give Google their database,
[53:26.360 --> 53:30.680]  they said, well, this is just a search engine. That's all that it is is an NSA database that's
[53:30.680 --> 53:36.360]  public that you've interfaced with voluntarily. They said, no, no, no, we're going to feed everybody's
[53:36.360 --> 53:41.160]  info into it, tie it into the cell towers, people's cameras on their phones, what they buy, what they
[53:41.160 --> 53:46.920]  sell, all the companies that have a global profile on everybody for social control. We're going to
[53:46.920 --> 53:53.640]  predict the future. Then we're going to control the future. We're building AI. But it's a neural,
[53:53.640 --> 54:00.440]  electronic digital silicon interface with biological life forms, not just humans, but all life on earth.
[54:02.440 --> 54:09.560]  And DARPA and NQTEL and the NSA and the CIA shed maximum support. You will be the global control
[54:09.560 --> 54:17.240]  system. Hail Google. And here you are and Google and Apple and all of them are moving to China.
[54:17.240 --> 54:24.120]  And they're doing it. And everything we warned you about 20 years ago is all
[54:24.120 --> 54:29.160]  admitted. So I'm the bad guy for being telling you 20 years ago and having NSA whistleblowers on.
[54:30.680 --> 54:36.440]  Being rights bad, being number one's bad, being supported's bad, being pro-humans bad,
[54:36.440 --> 54:41.240]  being pro-free markets bad, not wanting to be under radical Islamic control and having
[54:41.240 --> 54:50.280]  Linda Sorcerer on your life. It's all evil. So that's all coming up. China assigns every citizen
[54:50.280 --> 54:55.320]  a social credit score to identify who is and who isn't trustworthy. And our media's like,
[54:55.320 --> 55:00.360]  how good we need that too? And oh, don't worry, we told you this was coming. British politicians
[55:00.360 --> 55:05.960]  declare war on knives, want them licensed because their crime rates now higher than New York City
[55:05.960 --> 55:13.320]  after they took the guns. So there you go, ladies and gentlemen. Oh, we just learned now
[55:13.320 --> 55:18.920]  that the Guardian that passages from the Bible were plagiarized into the Quran original manuscript.
[55:18.920 --> 55:24.120]  Wow, that really shocks me. That's what it is. It's a mixture of a bunch of stuff that
[55:24.120 --> 55:30.040]  Muhammad was looking at, the Bible, Old Testament, New Testament, Judaism, Christianity,
[55:30.040 --> 55:34.120]  Zoroastrianism, a whole bunch of stuff. That's what the Quran is. If you read all those other
[55:34.120 --> 55:41.080]  books, it's a kind of a hodgepodge of those. So anyways, continuing. But the Bible is a,
[55:41.960 --> 55:50.840]  the Jew, it is the Talmud. It's the Old Testament and then the New Testament. So it's a continuation.
[55:53.000 --> 55:57.480]  But there's so much more I haven't gotten to coming up. I'm going to lay it all out.
[55:57.480 --> 56:04.120]  The Blue State collapse is accelerating. We'll look at Chicago's nearing collapse.
[56:05.080 --> 56:08.200]  We're also going to drill back through a lot of what I just mentioned. There's so much coming
[56:08.200 --> 56:14.920]  up today. But just briefly, think about info wars when you're shopping, when you're getting
[56:14.920 --> 56:19.000]  supplements, when you're getting water filtration, air filtration, high quality, non-gmo, heirloom
[56:19.000 --> 56:24.600]  seeds, Patriot apparel so you can meet like-minded people, promote freedom, t-shirts, you name it,
[56:24.600 --> 56:31.800]  ball caps, infowarstore.com. And perishable things, things you reuse like coffee and supplements
[56:32.520 --> 56:37.000]  are great to sign up for auto ship. You get additional 10% off. Patriot points in the
[56:37.000 --> 56:43.160]  month of April are double. So instead of five cents off every dollar, it's 10 cents. That's
[56:43.160 --> 56:48.040]  a big discount on your Patriot points this month towards future purchases. And it's again,
[56:48.040 --> 56:52.520]  a little free account right there with the Patriots point system and infowarstore.com.
[56:52.520 --> 57:00.200]  X2 was going to sell out this week. We got a little emergency shipment in and I've got the 25% off,
[57:00.200 --> 57:05.000]  though not still going, but it's got to end here. It's got to end by Sunday because it'll be a few
[57:05.000 --> 57:08.680]  months before we get more in. I'm going to sell out the rest of it at full price. And it's the
[57:08.680 --> 57:12.280]  good halogen. It's amazing. We're having trouble securing with deep breath crystals. It's the
[57:12.280 --> 57:16.680]  purest form of iodine out there. It doesn't give myself many others the stomach issues that the
[57:16.680 --> 57:21.560]  garbage iodine that's bound iodine that's not real atomic iodine causes. So it's in the organic
[57:21.560 --> 57:24.920]  palm oil. It's simply amazing. Consult your physician before you use it though, because you'll
[57:24.920 --> 57:29.400]  die without iodine. But at the same time, this is very, very potent, powerful stuff. So be careful
[57:29.400 --> 57:32.600]  with it. And I would use a third of the dose. Tell you what I personally do when I first started
[57:32.600 --> 57:36.520]  using it because you have a detox happens in two to four weeks. And that's very interesting what
[57:36.520 --> 57:39.880]  comes out of your skin, everything else. When you finally have the good halogen that your body
[57:39.880 --> 57:44.920]  operates off of info wars live.com to secure your extra today. Hour number two straight ahead.
[57:44.920 --> 57:46.520]  Please tell folks about the stage you're listening to.
[57:46.520 --> 57:54.440]  They use their media to assassinate real news. They use their schools to teach children that
[57:54.440 --> 58:00.280]  their president is another Hitler. They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award
[58:00.280 --> 58:05.800]  shows to repeat their narrative over and over again. And then they use their ex president to
[58:05.800 --> 58:12.360]  endorse the resistance all to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and
[58:12.360 --> 58:18.600]  sexism and xenophobia and homophobia to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and
[58:18.600 --> 58:24.920]  airports, bully and terrorize the law abiding until the only option left is for the police to do
[58:24.920 --> 58:31.000]  their jobs and stop the madness. And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their
[58:31.000 --> 58:38.760]  outrage. The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight
[58:38.760 --> 58:46.120]  this violence of lies with the clenched fist of truth. I'm the National Rifle Association of America
[58:46.120 --> 58:53.000]  and I'm freedom's safest place. You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60 plus

[59:45.480 --> 01:00:06.520]  thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution. Hello, this is Hank Hill
[01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:22.440]  and I'm telling you what, you need to listen to Alex Jones live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting
[01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:38.920]  worldwide. It's Alex Jones. All right, when we kick the next segment off here in about six minutes,
[01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:49.800]  I'm going to really drill into the amazing admissions by the Democrats, the EU, Hollywood,
[01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:58.920]  academia around the world in so-called liberal institutions, the call to silence
[01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:09.160]  Americana, the call to silence populism, the call to silence bold free market defense
[01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:13.800]  and the right of self defense and just everything that's rugged individualism,
[01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:22.840]  the attack on independent humanity because it is absolutely
[01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:34.520]  happening right now and I just feel like we should really raise the alarm here because
[01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:46.120]  this is so simple but at the same time so complex that we need to lay out just how they're going
[01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:49.640]  to do this because we have their plan, we've been living the plan for so long, we know they
[01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:54.440]  follow the plan and that's what's so frustrating is we know how to beat it, we know it's authoritarian,
[01:01:54.440 --> 01:02:00.680]  we know it's really bad news but there's so many yes men and so many people that are just soulless
[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:10.520]  and lazy and stupid and they'll tell you they're super unhappy no matter how much money they've got
[01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:15.800]  and all they do is just try to have a good time all the time and that's not what built civilization
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:23.240]  and I think those of us that are informed are weirdos and don't worry I have a good time too,
[01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:27.400]  I'm having a good time right now this is serious business
[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:33.400]  and it ties in the governmental pedophilia and all of it's coming out and how they try to spin it
[01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:38.440]  and divert it and use investigations into it that aren't 100% but then say none of it's going on
[01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:46.440]  when it's like saying the sky in blue it's incredible then I saw this video last weekend
[01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:51.240]  I never got to if I want to play it now Jordan Peterson who's just a rock star for saying there's
[01:02:51.240 --> 01:03:00.600]  only two sexes and two genomes there's one genome two two sexes and then the left is
[01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:06.360]  avant garde now if it has someone on saying the sky's blue and it just shows how far down the
[01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:13.640]  rat hole we are of dehumanization how do you end humanity how do you end the family you say don't
[01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:18.840]  say mother or father you say you saying your male or female hurt someone else this is going on
[01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:25.400]  and he says it's a disastrous narrative of victimization that's what it is and the women
[01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:30.360]  are being inducted into me too we're trying to keep blacks who've never been more upwardly mobile
[01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:37.560]  blacks in the us are the richest blacks in the world by far they think they're in literal hell
[01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:42.520]  and you know what have you got a bad attitude it's like going to a party and if you act weird
[01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:49.480]  and creepy and don't act outgoing and make people feel nervous they're not going to like you but if
[01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:54.920]  I want to I'm not saying I miss the cool I can go in any party anywhere I want tell jokes have a
[01:03:54.920 --> 01:04:02.120]  good time and and make friends so I don't care if you're a white person Hispanic black what it is
[01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:08.120]  if you've got a chip on your shoulder and you're nervous you're not going to make friends and so
[01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:13.480]  they are invoking all this under our backs so also coming up one of these clips Jordan Peterson
[01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:18.280]  if Trump gets booted out of office what will happen to his supporters well they're going to be
[01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:23.240]  censored they're going to be targeted people have to understand this isn't going to be like past
[01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:28.920]  elections the globalists the democrats the big banks they're going for broke they admit it's a
[01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:36.920]  civil war against us and they see those of us as the producers as milk cows or like women for gang
[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:43.960]  raping muslim harems don't understand they have just a savage criminal will to dominate that's their
[01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:51.320]  product dominate culture dominate reproduction dominate industry dominate religion dominate

[01:06:57.320 --> 01:07:08.440]  our children roger stone is going to be in studio with us coming up the bottom of the hour and then
[01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:18.600]  we're gonna have joining us mark randaza who is a top anti-slap lawyer looking at how the democrats
[01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:24.840]  are suing thousands of prominent libertarians nationalist conservatives veterans groups christian
[01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:31.880]  groups you name it remember under nine years eight years but you had some hangover still
[01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:37.960]  in the eight years of obama and now his last year or so with his deep state and hillary's deep
[01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:43.880]  state still somewhat in in place that was a real Freudian slip i'm going to cover that here just a
[01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:54.200]  moment fact next notice that over those years they targeted more than last time i checked
[01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:57.560]  in the congressional hearings three years ago because it still kept going on
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:08.120]  10 000 plus churches non-profit veterans groups nationalist groups conservatives groups
[01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:17.000]  to be shut down and or both criminally charged and then you had msnbc saying
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:23.640]  conservatives are evil the tea party's evil they deserve to be audited they deserve to be
[01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:29.800]  shut down they deserve to have their 501c 3 or 4 pulled they deserve to not have speech
[01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:35.960]  but rather than right can say gd america and bring down the us and all other stuff and he
[01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:41.240]  can be tax-free well you have a first amendment congress shall make no law respecting the
[01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:45.400]  establishment religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof then it goes into the press
[01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:51.240]  and the right to assemble and right to petition and redress the grievance you go well then how
[01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:58.680]  do they regulate churches because their church is in name only their charities under 501c 3
[01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:07.480]  and they go out of the church since the 50s into the 501c 3 and now they're regulatable
[01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:14.680]  and they had the ecumenical movement and the big denominations tell the churches to enroll in this
[01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:18.200]  and you still got a lot of churches that have the spirit of god in them and good people that
[01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:25.800]  are 501c 3 i'm not judging that but this intimidation that you can't be pro-life or you can't be pro-gun
[01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:30.200]  if you're a church they're saying that's political congress you'll make no law respecting an
[01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:34.520]  establishment of religion or prohibit the free exercise thereof but that's how they bring in
[01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:42.360]  these stamps and now they're telling you it's policy you got to take vaccines oh it's policy
[01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:48.520]  the kids belong to the state oh it's policy and they're just getting all of us worldwide to
[01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:55.240]  induct ourselves into this so remember the massive persecution of christians by the irs
[01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:59.640]  most of the same people that were there are still there one of trump's failings but
[01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:05.160]  he can't get anybody approved he's hard for him to dig anybody out of there it's it's they're
[01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:11.640]  entrenched a year and a half after he's in office they admit in the news that 80% of the government
[01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:17.240]  went in under clinton bush or obama and they're all on the same team the rhinos and the democrats
[01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:23.640]  the globalist against what trumps trying to do so that's why he's done such an incredible job with
[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:29.960]  what he's gotten done because this mutiny this rebellion is in place so the persecution of
[01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:38.280]  christians and 501c 3s and others is still going on and they've got the records of our veterans
[01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:45.240]  even officers who served very valiantly and others in other agencies and they won't give
[01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:51.880]  them a job in any academia in any government and they've been told it'll take trump at least another
[01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:59.000]  year so we've got to replace everybody i even learned from an individual it wasn't just a
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:07.400]  cia contractor but was a cia leader um for 10 years and he's a well-known guy sometimes i'll
[01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:11.720]  have him on the show he's been in the athletics and stuff like that there's a no although an
[01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:15.720]  athlete champion athlete and it's not tim kennedy and
[01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:28.120]  they know that ut is run by the communist chinese and i heard this a year ago from sources i mean
[01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:34.280]  i knew it but it was even in washington post three months ago and they have a database from the
[01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:42.040]  office the personnel management the 20 plus million first was 15 and 18 and 20 the 22 million names
[01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:47.720]  of every government agent everybody that ever worked for them ever asset their records what their
[01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:53.800]  political affiliation is what their sexual everything the cia has is given to the communist
[01:11:53.800 --> 01:12:02.600]  chinese and you try to go get a job just in the microcosm at ut it's all the key personnel now are
[01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:09.560]  either communist or muslims and actually have communist party meetings where they teach that
[01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:14.840]  fall on gong is bad and killing buddhas is good these are public meetings the communist party at
[01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:21.160]  at at at ut in fact washington post put it on screen that's what i mean the magnitude just where i
[01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:29.480]  live and people i know so trump's been sending this is this is what trump's trying to do and they
[01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:36.280]  know this people end to try to get jobs at these and then the chinese have the database they run
[01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:42.200]  the database and know who's trying to get a job the communist chinese control who can get a job at ut
[01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:52.520]  and i'm not going to get into specifics but the nuclear reactors folks the cyclotrons the clone
[01:12:52.520 --> 01:13:00.760]  labs yeah ut's got clone labs i know for a fact told you 15 years ago but i just told you about the
[01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:06.760]  monkeys i'm not going to get into the other primates and the cross species but let me tell
[01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:11.560]  you folks that's just one example of our military industrial complex he's now in communist chinese
[01:13:11.560 --> 01:13:18.760]  control the infiltration and takeover was already almost complete and what you see in the news is the
[01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:28.600]  tip of the iceberg so the communist chinese have apple everything's moving over they have all your
[01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:34.600]  apple ideas they have the office of personnel management 22 million names and when you go
[01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:39.720]  in to get a job at ut and any of these theoretical infrastructure areas they're looking right at you
[01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:46.600]  and they say we'll get back when they say sorry um you're not who we're looking for and then almost
[01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:53.320]  everyone they hire is chinese communist or muslim and they've almost converted the entire operation
[01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:58.440]  at true management level they still got old stupid white dudes on top of it it's a hedge
[01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:02.840]  fund it's not even university now and they got the football game and that's it and then everything
[01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:10.040]  else is just underground labs secret nuke bunkers underground railways clone labs uh you know super
[01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:17.960]  weapons general public has no idea that i mean i'm in a science fiction movie i've got chinese

[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:41.480]  starting to handle it right now but you talk about being overwhelmed i know thousands of times this
[01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:50.040]  only since trump got into the university nicks the communist chinese party officially
[01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:52.680]  running ut they already run it
[01:14:55.400 --> 01:15:01.720]  see people ask well why do we care if the chinese hacked and got the office of personnel management

[01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:16.200]  the keys to the kingdom we are merging with it they are the muscle game over man game over if we
[01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:25.400]  don't do something now now now now now now now it is not the russians the russians don't have
[01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:31.000]  the office of personnel management files if the russians were at ut i'd go down there and drag

[01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:24.280]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[01:20:24.280 --> 01:20:39.080]  it's globalist sabotage in 1949 the cia it was declassified 15 16 years ago
[01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:43.560]  i'd always been told that john birch society had written about it they were founded because
[01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:51.480]  john birch was a uh army personnel basically os s cia a preacher a bunch of the stuff and
[01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:55.000]  he got tortured to death because he didn't go along with the communist chinese getting
[01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:00.120]  control of china after world war two and they learned about that and so the john birch society
[01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:05.400]  kicked into gear to fight it so they laid all that i mean i remember when i was a teenager
[01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:09.640]  reading books about it and then i was watching history channel more than 15 years ago it was
[01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:16.120]  like 16 years ago and they had the former head of the southeast asia for the cia on
[01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:20.600]  he was like 90 something years old going well yes we actually put malin we thought he was
[01:21:20.600 --> 01:21:27.800]  a stabilizing effect and was good just nothing being said about this and i'm i'm watching the whole
[01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:37.000]  thing happen that's right it was an american bat this minister missionary united states army
[01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:40.520]  air force captain who was in the u.s military intelligence officer in channel in world war
[01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:47.720]  two john birch was killed in the confrontation with communist soldiers of wikipedia surprise wikipedia
[01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:52.760]  doesn't call him the bad person and a few days after the war ended he was posthumously awarded the
[01:21:52.760 --> 01:22:00.120]  army distinguished service model but he got the intelligence out on hey the os s is in here
[01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:03.800]  they're planning on putting the communist in we got to get the information out and the orders got
[01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:12.440]  since the communist you killed john birch but but i'm digressing imagine what john birch would do if
[01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:20.040]  it was in the washington post that communist chinese intelligence basically runs ut and was going to
[01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:29.640]  officially endow the main political science departments under the communist party endowed
[01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:35.560]  by beijing that's when people went whoa what's going on they're hanging their name on the door at
[01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:40.200]  this point how bad do you think it is and i realize you're a new listener and i'm saying this this
[01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:45.800]  sounds crazy they've been given all the deep water ports the panama canal 98% of rare earth minerals
[01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:52.040]  you think the us and others can't get at least 10% of them they have been given everything
[01:22:52.040 --> 01:23:00.680]  because they signed on to the globalist program university of texas at austin nix's beijing funded
[01:23:00.680 --> 01:23:07.640]  propaganda institute yeah right so so i i meant to get into the persecution of christians and
[01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:11.880]  everything's happened but you have to understand china's the model china's where they roll it out
[01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:16.520]  china's where they beta tested i told you four years ago with exact precision about the global
[01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:20.840]  social score to track everything you do and if you're not a good little globalist they start
[01:23:20.840 --> 01:23:26.040]  cutting back everything you've got things cost more you can't travel suddenly you can't work
[01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:31.160]  suddenly you can't eat then after you've been put in a ghetto you're taken away for reeducation if
[01:23:31.160 --> 01:23:37.800]  you're lucky this isn't a joke people it's the plan why did the universities are anti-free speech
[01:23:38.840 --> 01:23:43.560]  why do you think if you go to any major university and the antifa as they're called for the public
[01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:48.760]  they're really communist they have red flags and they call themselves the mal youth brigades the
[01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:53.800]  groups you've seen in austin we're in an abortion clinic protesting and saying black lives matter
[01:23:53.800 --> 01:24:01.480]  this abortion clinic kills 67% you know black kids at this particular clinic we went to and
[01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:10.280]  they show up they are out of ut ut students driving jaguars and 50 000 trucks and they get
[01:24:10.280 --> 01:24:14.360]  out and start physically attacking us and the police stand down because we're in a blue city
[01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:23.000]  and they go to malice meetings and that's the problem we infiltrated the ut meetings they're
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:29.720]  they're they're open to the public and we recorded a bunch of that and i've got to put reports out on
[01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:37.480]  that i mean it's just incredible they're using a communist chinese youth brigade college revolution
[01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:43.960]  model to roll out civil disturbance and martial law it's in the soros documents that came out
[01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:49.160]  obama tried this crap that's what all this race war stuff is in the new purge movie coming out
[01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:56.440]  out where it's like the army's kkk and where's kkk uniforms i'm not kidding white kkk uniforms
[01:24:57.240 --> 01:25:03.240]  and they hunt blacks that's not going on in the real world
[01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:14.760]  but that's what's now happening they push it for a simulation this is incredible
[01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:20.920]  why do you think we have a 900 billion a year deficit with china
[01:25:23.640 --> 01:25:26.520]  this is the criminal alliance this is the globalist alliance
[01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:32.600]  and that's why we're being told to hate russia because the globalists are close to overthrowing
[01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:37.800]  russia as well this is their plan yeah scroll back to the top i want to show folks that
[01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:44.360]  documents to tell plan for civil unrest and martial law in baltimore and they've confirmed
[01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:49.560]  these are real george soros's son runs it it's how they work with the local blue state police
[01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:54.760]  to even let the police attack them vice versa to try to get the crowd to have a larger riot
[01:25:54.760 --> 01:26:01.560]  to bring in a civil emergency and martial law now do you understand the maximum threat here
[01:26:02.920 --> 01:26:05.880]  they've been getting their asses handed to them because people are waking up to them
[01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:10.040]  but they're trying to take me out because they know i've reverse engineered the whole thing
[01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:15.080]  and they know we're linking up with patriots in the government at every level
[01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:22.280]  and they know that if people listen to what we're saying we can stop them
[01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:27.400]  to sit about a popularity contest i'm here to be attacked i'm here to hit the bar bar
[01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:31.480]  i'm here to take the hit so that we beat these people short term mid term long term
[01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:37.320]  all you mainline conservatives and libertarians and christians you better get out of your comfort
[01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:46.280]  zones and we'll lose the whole enchilada now tie this together fec report shows hillary clinton
[01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:50.440]  campaign laundered 84 million cut and drive it's illegal in full wars dot com's any white
[01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:57.480]  and they're reporting that sometimes today congress is going to get hundreds and hundreds and
[01:26:57.480 --> 01:27:02.200]  hundreds and hundreds of pages of new text between struck and his girlfriend and all the rest of it
[01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:05.800]  is going to be even more damning and i've talked to sources in the government that have seen them
[01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:13.160]  and have confirmed it how do they strike back ap says make it illegal to criticize mainline journalists
[01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:18.120]  calling it hate speech hillary came out a few days ago in a speech to the same thing
[01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:26.280]  and now research google search manipulation can swing nearly 80 percent of undecided voters
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:32.680]  search engines can shift 50 50 split among people who are undecided on the issue to a
[01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:39.160]  nine to ten split without awareness and google used to be a real search engine
[01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:45.240]  till the election then it became really really corrupt hiding results pushing fake results
[01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:49.160]  it's algorithm broken it's now just something where they force feed you
[01:27:51.240 --> 01:27:58.360]  and they admit that but they bragged they can influence almost all elections now with their
[01:27:58.360 --> 01:28:04.280]  their full bore breaking of the algorithm because 90 plus percent of all searches are done on google
[01:28:05.640 --> 01:28:09.800]  i go to bing now which i know is established but just to check it microsoft it's like the
[01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:14.600]  old google it's the same system and i go to a bunch of others it's just google it's just that
[01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:19.720]  old you know nsa database tracking system that then aggregates and shows what's most popular
[01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:24.280]  and ties it all together and then of course their start page all those other independent ones that's
[01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:28.840]  great but you go to google it's worthless and we've all got to unhabituate ourselves
[01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:36.200]  from from using it but here's the point is that they're making their move and hillary and the ap
[01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:41.320]  and jim acosta this is all coming up with roger stone get the videos they want you shut down they
[01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:45.640]  say when trump criticizes the press he's going to cause violence against him which is what our

[01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:13.400]  so
[01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:26.280]  and we are back live ladies and gentlemen roger stones here with us in studio but we're
[01:35:26.280 --> 01:35:31.960]  going to go to an important report first and come back with a roger stone here in just a
[01:35:31.960 --> 01:35:37.160]  few minutes i want to get into strategy in the 2018 election and looks like the blue wave
[01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:42.160]  It's starting to be the hype we knew it was, where they just lost this special election
[01:35:42.160 --> 01:35:43.160]  there in Arizona.
[01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:47.760]  We'll also look at the Democrats' open calls, the AP and others, to have conservative speech
[01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:52.320]  criticizing mainstream media be called hate speech and ban, where they can attack Trump,
[01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:56.680]  they can attack us, call us names, call us murderers, cockroaches, criminals, but we can't
[01:35:56.680 --> 01:35:59.400]  even say anything back to them.
[01:35:59.400 --> 01:36:00.400]  So we're going to get to that.
[01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:04.000]  But I want to play a John Bowne report that ties into all this.
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:11.680]  Dead broke DNC gambles with big lawsuit against Roger Stone, not just against Roger Stone,
[01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:16.120]  but also against Donald Trump that, you know, they found last Friday, so Roger's here exclusively
[01:36:16.120 --> 01:36:18.440]  with us, riding shotgun right into the next hour.
[01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:23.000]  We have a lawyer joining us to discuss the waterfront as well, but critical news here
[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:24.000]  straight ahead.
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:29.920]  But here is the important report, dead broke DNC gambles with bogus lawsuit.
[01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:35.600]  Depending on a status of sore loser never before seen in American politics, the Democrats
[01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:41.000]  have filed a lawsuit alleging that WikiLeaks, the Trump campaign, and Russia colluded to
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:46.640]  interfere in the 2016 presidential election, superseding Robert Mueller's nothing burger
[01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:47.640]  investigation.
[01:36:47.640 --> 01:36:53.160]  Although this lawsuit has Hillary Clinton revenge written all over it, chief potty mouth
[01:36:53.160 --> 01:36:58.840]  and chair of the Democratic National Committee, Tom Perez, acted as if he was unaware of former
[01:36:58.840 --> 01:37:17.840]  Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's influence.
[01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:22.960]  Heading into midterm elections, Perez also downplayed the amount of money it would take
[01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:27.840]  to win a lawsuit or whether it was filed in order to gamble for potential winnings to
[01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:28.840]  fund the candidates.
[01:37:28.840 --> 01:37:32.680]  I will ask you, how much money is this going to cost to DNC, how much money are you taking
[01:37:32.680 --> 01:37:36.280]  away from 2018 to focus on 2016 in Russia?
[01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:42.640]  Chuck, we can't afford not to do this because when you look ahead and you see what was done
[01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:46.280]  before and what they're trying to do again, our democracy is at stake.
[01:37:46.280 --> 01:37:49.480]  It's hard to win elections when you have interference in elections.
[01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:50.600]  We've been winning elections.
[01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:52.400]  We know how to walk and chew gum.
[01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:54.760]  We've got boots on the ground right now in Arizona.
[01:37:54.760 --> 01:37:56.360]  We have a great candidate.
[01:37:56.360 --> 01:37:58.400]  He's an undeniable underdog.
[01:37:58.400 --> 01:37:59.480]  We're fighting there.
[01:37:59.480 --> 01:38:00.720]  We just won in the...
[01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:04.120]  You didn't answer how much money is this lawsuit going to take this year?
[01:38:04.120 --> 01:38:05.120]  Millions?
[01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:09.520]  I don't know the amount of money that it will take, but I'll tell you, it's hard to put
[01:38:09.520 --> 01:38:11.800]  a price tag on preserving democracy.
[01:38:11.800 --> 01:38:12.800]  And you know what?
[01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:17.600]  That's why I concluded that it would be irresponsible of me not to do this.
[01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:22.840]  The week reported back in January that the DNC is dead broke, the Democratic Party is
[01:38:22.840 --> 01:38:29.680]  carrying more than $6 million in debt, according to year-end filings, and has just $6.5 million
[01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:30.680]  in the bank.
[01:38:30.680 --> 01:38:35.040]  Do the math, and the party is working with just over $400,000 overall.
[01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:38.520]  Meanwhile, the Republicans are swimming in pools of money.
[01:38:38.520 --> 01:38:45.520]  The Republican National Committee had raised $132 million by the end of 2017, about twice
[01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:53.120]  as much as the DNC, and entered 2018 with almost $40 million to spare, with not a penny
[01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:54.120]  of debt.
[01:38:54.120 --> 01:38:59.120]  The lawsuit also relies on questionable evidence, most of it from the Mockingbird media.
[01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:04.240]  But a lot of it relies on things like news reports, including a single-sourced or anonymously
[01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:05.240]  sourced reports.
[01:39:05.240 --> 01:39:09.920]  So the challenge in this suit is going to be translating those essentially news reports
[01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:13.240]  into evidence that's going to be admissible in court.
[01:39:13.240 --> 01:39:16.920]  Now what's relevant right now is not necessarily whether they can do that, but whether or not
[01:39:16.920 --> 01:39:19.200]  they can survive a motion to dismiss.
[01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:23.360]  Whether or not they have a well-pleaded complaint on the face, it does seem likely that this
[01:39:23.360 --> 01:39:27.680]  lawsuit, at least some defendants, at least some claims, are likely to survive a motion
[01:39:27.680 --> 01:39:28.880]  to dismiss.
[01:39:28.880 --> 01:39:32.880]  This is most relevant because it means that they'll move on to the discovery phase.
[01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:37.200]  That might end up becoming a really, really powerful tool for the DNC to actually unearth
[01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:38.200]  new information.
[01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:43.560]  Careful what you ask for, ZeroHedge reports WikiLeaks will be countersuing, announcing
[01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:48.440]  over Twitter that they are seeking donations for a countersuit, noting, we've never lost
[01:39:48.440 --> 01:39:52.400]  a publishing case, and discovery is going to be amazing fun.
[01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:58.040]  ZeroHedge also added, what's interesting is that of all the sources that DNC cites in
[01:39:58.040 --> 01:40:02.920]  their massive lawsuit, the steel dossier they paid for isn't one of them.
[01:40:02.920 --> 01:40:08.160]  Tom Perez is working like a man that owes the mob money, acting in total desperation.
[01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:11.320]  What has become the norm for the party he leads?
[01:40:11.320 --> 01:40:13.760]  John Bound reporting for Infowars.com.
[01:40:13.760 --> 01:40:20.000]  Now we're going to get Roger Stone's expert take on all this, but a big treat, you could
[01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000]  say.
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:27.040]  I've gotten emails and texts saying, hey, Roger Stone worked for the Nexium sex cult,
[01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:28.040]  and why aren't you bringing it up?
[01:40:28.040 --> 01:40:33.320]  Well, because I talked to him about it a long time ago, 2007 for what, two months, he worked
[01:40:33.320 --> 01:40:37.320]  for them because they had a bunch of businesses and companies, and he lives in New York part
[01:40:37.320 --> 01:40:42.440]  of the time, and then he can give you the big scoop on it.
[01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:46.600]  The Brothman daughters, the connections of the Clintons, all of this, and so that ties
[01:40:46.600 --> 01:40:49.320]  into the Democrats, but he was also hired as a consultant.
[01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:54.800]  I mean, Roger, just briefly on this, back before he retired from lobbying, what just
[01:40:54.800 --> 01:41:00.480]  four years ago, you had one of the biggest lobbying firms, some media said the biggest
[01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:05.240]  for a small shop, but I mean, yes, you've worked for thousands of clients.
[01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:09.720]  There was a time when we had the dominant lobbying shop in Washington DC, Black, Manafort,
[01:41:09.720 --> 01:41:13.160]  and Stone, once Black, Manafort, Stone, and Atwater.
[01:41:13.160 --> 01:41:20.640]  In this particular case, Alex, State Senator Joe Bruno, who was the Senate majority leader,
[01:41:20.640 --> 01:41:24.440]  introduced me to the folks at Nexium.
[01:41:24.440 --> 01:41:32.200]  I met the Brothman sisters, I audited this class, which was a bunch of middle-aged housewives
[01:41:32.200 --> 01:41:37.920]  trying to learn kind of self-esteem, certainly didn't seem like any kind of a cult to me.
[01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:41.720]  Well, hold on, because you got on the rabbit hole, we'll talk about it next time.
[01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:45.120]  I want to get into the attacks on free speech, I want to get into blue-way fizzles.
[01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:46.120]  Is that accurate?
[01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:49.200]  Tucker says, don't run against Hillary, run against the openly racist extremists.
[01:41:49.200 --> 01:41:53.040]  We're going to talk to you as a political consultant on the other side about that, Roger Stone.
[01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:58.280]  But first, ladies and gentlemen, if you financially support us, if you buy the high-quality products

[01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:23.240]  The problem is everything else in the market is crap, and our search to find something
[01:42:23.240 --> 01:42:26.120]  pure and good that didn't make people sick, we found it.
[01:42:26.120 --> 01:42:32.160]  X2, that we may run out of the source, it's not going to be 25% off much longer, infowarsstore.com.
[01:42:32.160 --> 01:42:36.440]  Also, BBC reports on mold yeast and stuff in the gut causing depression.

[01:44:01.680 --> 01:44:05.640]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestive process and increase the bioavailability of
[01:44:05.640 --> 01:44:08.960]  nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[01:44:08.960 --> 01:44:13.080]  They also help prevent discomfort from a digestion caused by fermentation of undigested
[01:44:13.080 --> 01:44:15.120]  food particles in the gut.
[01:44:15.120 --> 01:44:17.560]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[01:44:17.560 --> 01:44:21.480]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[01:44:21.480 --> 01:44:24.640]  Enjoy the full potential of protein rich foods again.
[01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:29.200]  You can eat protein heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort
[01:44:29.200 --> 01:44:31.960]  commonly associated with high meat diets.
[01:44:31.960 --> 01:44:36.200]  Just one pill with every high protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption
[01:44:36.200 --> 01:44:40.160]  of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[01:44:40.160 --> 01:44:44.600]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates so you
[01:44:44.600 --> 01:44:46.720]  can fully digest all types of meals.
[01:44:46.720 --> 01:44:48.560]  Don't let a meal go to waste.

[01:44:57.960 --> 01:45:01.440]  Introducing Cell Force by Infowarslife.
[01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:05.920]  Cell Force focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[01:45:05.920 --> 01:45:08.680]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[01:45:08.680 --> 01:45:11.680]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:16.000]  Cell Force helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria, much
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:22.040]  like a cellular engine overhaul, because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency,
[01:45:22.040 --> 01:45:25.400]  then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[01:45:25.400 --> 01:45:30.560]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from
[01:45:30.560 --> 01:45:33.480]  these reactive oxygen species.
[01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:38.520]  The antioxidants found in Cell Force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[01:45:38.520 --> 01:45:43.320]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen
[01:45:43.320 --> 01:45:46.200]  species and other free radicals.
[01:45:46.200 --> 01:45:51.160]  Boost, protect, and adapt with Cell Force from Infowarslife.
[01:45:51.160 --> 01:45:57.800]  Head to Infowarslife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:45:57.800 --> 01:46:01.720]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60-plus products, we have them
[01:46:01.720 --> 01:46:02.720]  in Full-Warslife.
[01:46:02.720 --> 01:46:04.200]  It'd take hours.
[01:46:04.200 --> 01:46:06.720]  Michael ZX Plus now has a lower price.
[01:46:06.720 --> 01:46:07.720]  It's stronger.
[01:46:07.720 --> 01:46:09.440]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[01:46:09.440 --> 01:46:12.720]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[01:46:12.720 --> 01:46:13.840]  It's back in stock.
[01:46:13.840 --> 01:46:17.040]  The real red pill, it's been sold out for months.
[01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:20.520]  It's got the preclinone, that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[01:46:20.520 --> 01:46:24.880]  Then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins, the amino acids, so you can upload it.
[01:46:24.880 --> 01:46:29.880]  Our latest product that goes great with the super blue colloidal silver and iodine fortified
[01:46:29.880 --> 01:46:34.000]  toothpaste is super blue silver immune gargle.
[01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:35.000]  That's a spray you do.
[01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:36.240]  You can also swallow it.
[01:46:36.240 --> 01:46:41.720]  It's a supplement with iodine, super high quality silver, and a lot more.
[01:46:41.720 --> 01:46:42.920]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:48.640]  So thank you all for remembering infowarstore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's
[01:46:48.640 --> 01:46:52.080]  already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake, and it's so essential to spread
[01:46:52.080 --> 01:46:53.080]  the word.
[01:46:53.080 --> 01:47:01.400]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[01:47:01.400 --> 01:47:14.280]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:47:14.280 --> 01:47:26.400]  The Alex Jones show, because there is a war on for your mind.
[01:47:26.400 --> 01:47:32.840]  Well, Roger Stone won his New York defamation case against him, zero coverage when he won,
[01:47:32.840 --> 01:47:43.080]  when they threw the suit in Virginia on Tuesday morning, or Monday morning, excuse me, zero
[01:47:43.080 --> 01:47:46.960]  coverage except here, and I'm told they might try to refile it, but once you've done that,
[01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:47.960]  it's really hard.
[01:47:47.960 --> 01:47:53.400]  They realize they just filed pure BS, it was defamation.
[01:47:53.400 --> 01:47:59.000]  But again, it's this tactic where they're finally like screenplays now as lawsuits,
[01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:02.120]  and they just want the press from it, but they don't think they're going to pay, but
[01:48:02.120 --> 01:48:07.360]  we filed a lawsuit against them for it, no coverage of that, but the original plaintiffs
[01:48:07.360 --> 01:48:10.960]  are starting to go, oh, wait a minute, you're exactly right.
[01:48:10.960 --> 01:48:13.280]  It's all about the headline.
[01:48:13.280 --> 01:48:19.320]  It's not about a real case, it's not about evidence or proof or a responsible case.
[01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:24.080]  It's an abuse of the judicial process for the purposes of getting a negative headline
[01:48:24.080 --> 01:48:29.240]  on Alex Jones, or on Roger Stone, or on Info Wars, and then they turn around and they use
[01:48:29.240 --> 01:48:34.600]  the headline as the rationale for censoring you on the Internet.
[01:48:34.600 --> 01:48:41.440]  It's an insidious plot, but the Democratic National Committee lawsuit is a perfect example.
[01:48:41.440 --> 01:48:43.640]  This is a left-wing conspiracy theory.
[01:48:43.640 --> 01:48:51.120]  No evidence, no proof, based on conjecture, supposition, projection, it's nonsense.
[01:48:51.120 --> 01:48:56.800]  It's in this case, it's a recycle of the lawsuit that the Obama crowd already has filed against
[01:48:56.800 --> 01:48:57.800]  me.
[01:48:57.800 --> 01:49:02.560]  And notice, even the media goes, okay, Russia gets over, we're moving on to Michael Cohen
[01:49:02.560 --> 01:49:09.000]  and women in the whole dragnet, boom, they refile all the old lies again like they filed
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:12.440]  on you and the president with Obama's law firm last year.
[01:49:12.440 --> 01:49:16.080]  Do they really think that the Russian state and the Russian army are going to show up
[01:49:16.080 --> 01:49:19.320]  in court for this, or do they just throw their name into the lawsuit?
[01:49:19.320 --> 01:49:22.320]  But that's the point, is they'll go, Russia didn't show up.
[01:49:22.320 --> 01:49:23.320]  Right.
[01:49:23.320 --> 01:49:24.320]  It's all about-
[01:49:24.320 --> 01:49:28.280]  Like if the Russians sued the U.S., you sue people through the WTO, the IMF, the World
[01:49:28.280 --> 01:49:31.720]  Trade Organization, no, no, stop, we're getting to that next hour, we're the lawyer coming
[01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:34.800]  on to discuss it, not one of our lawyers, we don't have our lawyers on this case as we
[01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:36.360]  discuss the generalities.
[01:49:36.360 --> 01:49:40.040]  Even my lawyer's early on said, I wouldn't have this press conference in D.C., their
[01:49:40.040 --> 01:49:42.400]  suit is the worst thing we've ever seen.
[01:49:42.400 --> 01:49:46.520]  He'll get thrown out before we get into court, and they were right.
[01:49:46.520 --> 01:49:50.320]  So now I'm not giving out tactics on the other fake ones, I don't just say they're
[01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:52.320]  fake to act confident.
[01:49:52.320 --> 01:49:56.680]  If I've done something before that I think crosses the line, off record, I've settled
[01:49:56.680 --> 01:50:00.760]  a couple lawsuits when we've made a mistake, okay, and I'm not going to say obviously which
[01:50:00.760 --> 01:50:02.680]  one is off record.
[01:50:02.680 --> 01:50:07.520]  But I mean, when they're just cuckoo-land lies, I don't know what they're thinking,
[01:50:07.520 --> 01:50:08.520]  Roger.
[01:50:08.520 --> 01:50:09.520]  Well, two things.
[01:50:09.520 --> 01:50:12.200]  First of all, it's about bankrupting us.
[01:50:12.200 --> 01:50:17.840]  Just the motion to dismiss these lawsuits, just the motion to dismiss can cost you $100,000.
[01:50:17.840 --> 01:50:18.840]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:50:18.840 --> 01:50:24.160]  It costs a lot of money, a huge amount of money.
[01:50:24.160 --> 01:50:27.120]  We've already spent, I don't want to give them any happy times out there, that's why
[01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:29.200]  listeners need to understand.
[01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:32.720]  We really do have the best turmeric bodies, we really do have the best iodine, we really
[01:50:32.720 --> 01:50:37.960]  do have the best multivitamin liquid formula with the vitamin mineral fusion, it's great
[01:50:37.960 --> 01:50:38.960]  for you and your children.
[01:50:38.960 --> 01:50:42.280]  We really do have the best air filters, we really do have the best storeable food and
[01:50:42.280 --> 01:50:46.760]  a free water filter, the $200 value with three months supply, powered by my patron supply,
[01:50:46.760 --> 01:50:49.080]  the name, in high quality 25-year store.
[01:50:49.080 --> 01:50:52.840]  I mean, I barely plug one minute an hour because I'm so obsessed with the information.
[01:50:52.840 --> 01:50:56.160]  But it is critical to support our local AM and FM stations.
[01:50:56.160 --> 01:50:59.280]  It is critical to become a local sponsor.
[01:50:59.280 --> 01:51:03.600]  It's critical to buy our products, it's critical, you know, Roger Stone works for Info Wars,
[01:51:03.600 --> 01:51:07.200]  he also has Stone Cold Truth, he's got a new book coming out we're going to be showing.
[01:51:07.200 --> 01:51:11.680]  We need capital, we don't have George Soros, we don't have the big money.
[01:51:11.680 --> 01:51:17.840]  You know, Roger, you had one of the top lobbying firms in the country and this is a good question
[01:51:17.840 --> 01:51:19.440]  as to working for this other news.
[01:51:19.440 --> 01:51:24.040]  Why did you decide, what was it, six, seven years ago to stop lobbying?
[01:51:24.040 --> 01:51:26.760]  Because Alex, I love politics, not government.
[01:51:26.760 --> 01:51:31.560]  I love the fight, winning a campaign, fighting for the things you believe in, taking on candidates
[01:51:31.560 --> 01:51:33.840]  or causes that you believe in.
[01:51:33.840 --> 01:51:40.320]  I'm not all that interested in the Third Amendment to the Treasury Bill regarding the treatment
[01:51:40.320 --> 01:51:44.600]  of casino income and so on, it's just highly technical.
[01:51:44.600 --> 01:51:49.640]  So patting around the halls of Congress, asking congressmen and senators to do things
[01:51:49.640 --> 01:51:50.640]  for you.
[01:51:50.640 --> 01:51:51.640]  It gets old.
[01:51:51.640 --> 01:51:52.640]  It was never my thing.
[01:51:52.640 --> 01:51:56.280]  It's more fun having, you know, fans come out and aunties come out and attack you and
[01:51:56.280 --> 01:51:59.200]  be in the, you want to be in the arena and change the world, not just make money.
[01:51:59.200 --> 01:52:02.760]  I've written five books, two of them are New York Times bestsellers, I have another one
[01:52:02.760 --> 01:52:04.400]  coming.
[01:52:04.400 --> 01:52:05.720]  This is the fight I've chosen.
[01:52:05.720 --> 01:52:11.600]  Now I can help candidates and causes I believe in, not because I need the money, but because
[01:52:11.600 --> 01:52:16.000]  they're good men and women who believe in what we believe, who are prepared to take on the
[01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:20.160]  globalists, who are prepared to tell the truth about the two-party duopoly that's ruining
[01:52:20.160 --> 01:52:21.160]  this country.
[01:52:21.160 --> 01:52:27.000]  Now I want to slow down because I tend to speed up and we miss everything.
[01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:28.320]  I want to get in the blue wave.
[01:52:28.320 --> 01:52:29.320]  Is it really dead?
[01:52:29.320 --> 01:52:32.960]  I don't want to be too over-optimistic, but I think the numbers show it is, but they're
[01:52:32.960 --> 01:52:34.960]  still in elections, so we got to watch out.
[01:52:34.960 --> 01:52:37.480]  I think Tucker's right and wrong.
[01:52:37.480 --> 01:52:39.840]  He says, don't run against Hillary.
[01:52:39.840 --> 01:52:40.960]  Well she's still the deep state.
[01:52:40.960 --> 01:52:44.000]  Her apparatus is still in place.
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:48.600]  So I agree, don't run about her as the past, but run about how her people are still in
[01:52:48.600 --> 01:52:52.760]  there and we're fighting deep state, see, because they always lay out, oh, run against
[01:52:52.760 --> 01:52:57.480]  her because she's old and bad or run against, you know, you know, no, don't run against
[01:52:57.480 --> 01:52:58.480]  all of it.
[01:52:58.480 --> 01:53:02.320]  There should be out doing more rallies so we can see leftists come out and riot and go
[01:53:02.320 --> 01:53:03.320]  crazy.
[01:53:03.320 --> 01:53:04.320]  That gives them up, you know, in the polls everywhere.
[01:53:04.320 --> 01:53:07.040]  So I mean, I don't know who's giving them advice.
[01:53:07.040 --> 01:53:08.680]  It's so clear what needs to be done here.
[01:53:08.680 --> 01:53:13.880]  Meanwhile, FEC records document that Hillary Clinton campaign laundered $84 million to
[01:53:13.880 --> 01:53:19.920]  the foundation, conservatively, meanwhile, we're worried about, did Michael Cohen pay
[01:53:19.920 --> 01:53:20.920]  off some bimbos?
[01:53:20.920 --> 01:53:26.160]  I mean, as long as they're not beating the bimbos, and I'm a libertarian, I'm not in
[01:53:26.160 --> 01:53:30.440]  the bimbo department, but my whole point is, is that there's not even proof of that.
[01:53:30.440 --> 01:53:31.840]  But you know, my God, it's not Russia.
[01:53:31.840 --> 01:53:32.840]  It's now bimbos.
[01:53:32.840 --> 01:53:37.840]  So let's start with this, FEC records, info wars.com show Clinton campaign laundered $84
[01:53:37.840 --> 01:53:38.840]  million.
[01:53:38.840 --> 01:53:41.600]  It was right through the records, totally illegal, use it in the campaign.
[01:53:41.600 --> 01:53:42.600]  It's all right there.
[01:53:42.600 --> 01:53:46.640]  But AP says it's okay, ban criticizing mainline journalists.
[01:53:46.640 --> 01:53:50.840]  That's the new theme from Hillary, Acosta, the Associated Press, very dangerous.
[01:53:50.840 --> 01:53:55.200]  Well, fortunately for us, Hillary refuses to ride off into the sunset.
[01:53:55.200 --> 01:53:58.640]  So it's not, it's not up to us whether she is relevant.
[01:53:58.640 --> 01:54:02.520]  She's making herself relevant by hanging around.
[01:54:02.520 --> 01:54:05.080]  Professional Democrats, I know, are tearing out their hair over this.
[01:54:05.080 --> 01:54:07.600]  They just want the Clintons to leave.
[01:54:07.600 --> 01:54:14.280]  Barack Obama's public positioning is far more favorable, but Hillary refuses to go.
[01:54:14.280 --> 01:54:16.120]  But he's still smart if she was head down.
[01:54:16.120 --> 01:54:20.920]  Well, there's no question because what he knew and when he knew it regarding the Steele
[01:54:20.920 --> 01:54:23.800]  dossier and the illegal unconstitutional.
[01:54:23.800 --> 01:54:27.480]  We know he quarterbacks that, the president has all the NSA data now.
[01:54:27.480 --> 01:54:30.120]  I mean, we have them.
[01:54:30.120 --> 01:54:34.040]  It's the greatest violation of civil liberties in American political history.
[01:54:34.040 --> 01:54:38.400]  It's an outrageous crime for which somebody has to be punished.
[01:54:38.400 --> 01:54:42.840]  So he doesn't want people going around asking, what did the president know and when did he
[01:54:42.840 --> 01:54:44.400]  know it?
[01:54:44.400 --> 01:54:50.040]  Separately, it's all over the news, the Communist infiltration by China, they basically run
[01:54:50.040 --> 01:54:55.200]  in major Washington Post articles, surprisingly a few, and Bezos admits it, they run almost
[01:54:55.200 --> 01:54:56.200]  every public university.
[01:54:56.200 --> 01:54:59.240]  They're the number one funders, just like the number one owners of our debt, and they
[01:54:59.240 --> 01:55:09.240]  openly have pro-mau and pro-kill, fall-on-gone events that are the main chairs now at UT.
[01:55:09.240 --> 01:55:11.320]  I mean, I read this, I can't even believe it.
[01:55:11.320 --> 01:55:17.520]  I was told by CIA guys two years ago that UT was run by the Chai comms and they wanted
[01:55:17.520 --> 01:55:18.520]  to do something about it.
[01:55:18.520 --> 01:55:19.520]  And now it's in the news.
[01:55:19.520 --> 01:55:20.520]  What?
[01:55:20.520 --> 01:55:21.520]  I mean, what?
[01:55:21.520 --> 01:55:22.520]  And we're going about Russians.
[01:55:22.520 --> 01:55:24.080]  I am so sick of that red herring.
[01:55:24.080 --> 01:55:27.880]  That's the diversion while we're getting taken over by the Chai comms, people.
[01:55:27.880 --> 01:55:28.880]  There's no question.
[01:55:28.880 --> 01:55:34.680]  And we have helped them by giving them most favored trading nation status by bending over
[01:55:34.680 --> 01:55:36.360]  for them at every turn.
[01:55:36.360 --> 01:55:40.160]  That's the legacy of George H.W. Bush, by the way.
[01:55:40.160 --> 01:55:46.400]  The real danger today is Chinese communism, not the former Soviet Union.
[01:55:46.400 --> 01:55:51.800]  I'm not saying that they're our friends, but we have a much more aggressive adversary
[01:55:51.800 --> 01:55:52.800]  in the Chinese.
[01:55:52.800 --> 01:55:55.280]  Do we have a $900 billion deficit with Russia?
[01:55:55.280 --> 01:55:58.360]  In fact, last time I heard, I think they have a trade deficit with us.
[01:55:58.360 --> 01:55:59.800]  I think that's correct.
[01:55:59.800 --> 01:56:04.160]  No, China is the, this is the big enchilada.
[01:56:04.160 --> 01:56:05.520]  And the president knows it.
[01:56:05.520 --> 01:56:06.520]  There's the irony.
[01:56:06.520 --> 01:56:11.600]  He's totally got their number, which is why he is cracking down with these tariffs.
[01:56:11.600 --> 01:56:12.760]  I don't think he loves tariffs.
[01:56:12.760 --> 01:56:14.840]  In fact, I know he doesn't like tariffs.
[01:56:14.840 --> 01:56:17.720]  He does like using them as a club to get them to the table.
[01:56:17.720 --> 01:56:21.080]  Well, when they've got all their internal tariffs to the tune of $900 billion, $500
[01:56:21.080 --> 01:56:23.720]  billion in trade, $300 billion in intellectual property, that's conservative.
[01:56:23.720 --> 01:56:27.960]  I mean, they're more than half the global trade deficit.
[01:56:27.960 --> 01:56:31.560]  And I want to get into this too with you, not to my horn, but remember election night,
[01:56:31.560 --> 01:56:34.720]  I got really concerned all year and I said, listen, the real war is going to start now.
[01:56:34.720 --> 01:56:39.200]  I'm glad we got Trump in, but they're going to counter offensive so hard the real war
[01:56:39.200 --> 01:56:40.200]  is about to start.
[01:56:40.200 --> 01:56:43.920]  And I was just worried that listeners and people don't realize it's on.
[01:56:43.920 --> 01:56:45.440]  And I think they get it now.
[01:56:45.440 --> 01:56:52.040]  Well, also you said at the time and since the Russian thing will fizzle out, you said,
[01:56:52.040 --> 01:56:53.880]  then they're going to switch to sex.
[01:56:53.880 --> 01:56:57.720]  They're going to, they're going to, they're going to re-up these claims of a bunch of bogus
[01:56:57.720 --> 01:56:59.640]  women that Trump assaulted them.
[01:56:59.640 --> 01:57:04.080]  And then, then that died down and you said, don't worry, it will be back.
[01:57:04.080 --> 01:57:05.640]  And here it is front and center.
[01:57:05.640 --> 01:57:11.240]  No, I think they launched me to just to try to get past Hillary and Hollywood to just
[01:57:11.240 --> 01:57:12.240]  make it about everybody.
[01:57:12.240 --> 01:57:13.240]  Right.
[01:57:13.240 --> 01:57:17.120]  You know, it's just smoke screen for the pedophilia, raping women, men, all of it.
[01:57:17.120 --> 01:57:18.920]  And you can see how they pre-program this.
[01:57:18.920 --> 01:57:24.200]  Plus, it was a way to try to take Weinstein, which was an enormous bump in the road for
[01:57:24.200 --> 01:57:27.640]  them and turn it back on us, try to make it about.
[01:57:27.640 --> 01:57:29.760]  So let's look into the future again with Roger Stone.
[01:57:29.760 --> 01:57:34.760]  I'm Alex Jones, your host on the other side of this quick break, infowars.com, newswars.com.
[01:57:34.760 --> 01:57:35.760]  His new book's about to come out.
[01:57:35.760 --> 01:57:36.760]  We'll tell you about that.
[01:57:36.760 --> 01:57:40.560]  But when we come back, we're going to get specifically into the blue wave.
[01:57:40.560 --> 01:57:43.640]  And you know, is it in trouble with this Arizona race?
[01:57:43.640 --> 01:57:44.920]  And then we'll look beyond that.
[01:57:44.920 --> 01:57:45.920]  Stay with us.
[01:57:45.920 --> 01:57:53.760]  Let's go to Devin and Florida, Devin and Florida, you're on the air.
[01:57:53.760 --> 01:57:54.760]  Great.
[01:57:54.760 --> 01:57:55.760]  Hey, thank you so much.
[01:57:55.760 --> 01:57:59.560]  Listen, I have bought your product and I got to say they're amazing.
[01:57:59.560 --> 01:58:05.560]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it because I've got caveman, superman vitality, secret
[01:58:05.560 --> 01:58:07.680]  swell, fireman interfusion.
[01:58:07.680 --> 01:58:09.160]  I've got the body armor.
[01:58:09.160 --> 01:58:10.160]  Wow.
[01:58:10.160 --> 01:58:12.480]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible.
[01:58:12.480 --> 01:58:14.160]  Which pharmaceuticals do you like best?
[01:58:14.160 --> 01:58:17.840]  I really like the vitamin mineral fusion to be honest.
[01:58:17.840 --> 01:58:18.840]  That's amazing.
[01:58:18.840 --> 01:58:19.840]  That's incredible.
[01:58:19.840 --> 01:58:23.440]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible, like I haven't felt sweet.
[01:58:23.440 --> 01:58:29.560]  My morning was fantastic and I love the guys, I love the infowars through and I just want
[01:58:29.560 --> 01:58:34.160]  to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence,
[01:58:34.160 --> 01:58:35.160]  just buy it.
[01:58:35.160 --> 01:58:36.160]  We'll love it.
[01:58:36.160 --> 01:58:38.560]  I'm telling you, I've never bought a bad product.

[02:00:17.480 --> 02:00:22.160]  Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.160 --> 02:00:29.960]  I'm sitting here in the big shadow government command base, Austin, Texas, sitting on top
[02:00:29.960 --> 02:00:35.040]  of the big underground cities, the big secret nuclear reactors at UT, all of it.
[02:00:35.040 --> 02:00:37.880]  I'm not just talking about JJ Pickles Center in North Austin.
[02:00:37.880 --> 02:00:41.520]  Roger Stone's here, we were talking about letting the communist Chinese in, even as
[02:00:41.520 --> 02:00:45.600]  the Washington Post has to admit, that basically took over the UT government department, their
[02:00:45.600 --> 02:00:50.280]  research labs, and that ties into Trump saying 300 billion in intellectual property.
[02:00:50.280 --> 02:00:54.360]  That's just what we know in intellectual property, in products, in patents theft.
[02:00:54.360 --> 02:00:59.520]  What about all the secret stuff, the DARPA stuff, and that's just UT, the biggest university
[02:00:59.520 --> 02:01:01.520]  in the world.
[02:01:01.520 --> 02:01:06.880]  And besides MIT, one of the biggest science centers in the country, Stanford's big as
[02:01:06.880 --> 02:01:12.840]  well, and it's Chinese communist run, and that's in the news, we're hearing about Russians,
[02:01:12.840 --> 02:01:13.840]  Roger.
[02:01:13.840 --> 02:01:18.280]  And they manipulate our currency, and they play games on trade.
[02:01:18.280 --> 02:01:21.840]  No, the Russians are the number one problem in the world.
[02:01:21.840 --> 02:01:26.080]  I'm not saying the Russians are not a problem, but we ought to be focused on the Chinese
[02:01:26.080 --> 02:01:28.680]  menace, it seems to me.
[02:01:28.680 --> 02:01:32.000]  But you were elaborating on that, I mean, Trump gets this.
[02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:35.000]  He's been right about this for 15 years.
[02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:39.200]  He's been harping on the fact that they steal our patents, they steal our technology, they
[02:01:39.200 --> 02:01:43.600]  steal our jobs, they cheat in all their trade.
[02:01:43.600 --> 02:01:48.520]  That's why I was glad to see him follow through on the tariffs, even though I philosophically
[02:01:48.520 --> 02:01:52.640]  agree that the tariffs are probably not that effective, they're effective at getting them
[02:01:52.640 --> 02:01:56.720]  to the table and bludging them into better behavior.
[02:01:56.720 --> 02:01:58.720]  And that's, I think, the point of it.
[02:01:58.720 --> 02:02:03.960]  I do want to go back to your blue wave stuff, because I think the Democrats have counted
[02:02:03.960 --> 02:02:05.920]  their chickens way too early.
[02:02:05.920 --> 02:02:10.800]  Well, we know it's hype, like saying, Ted Cruz is in a dead heat, Ted Cruz is going
[02:02:10.800 --> 02:02:11.800]  to lose.
[02:02:11.800 --> 02:02:17.120]  That's pure push polling to create the perception so Republicans don't come out and Democrats
[02:02:17.120 --> 02:02:19.160]  want to come in for the victory.
[02:02:19.160 --> 02:02:20.760]  What are they running on?
[02:02:20.760 --> 02:02:23.800]  They have no plan to revitalize the economy.
[02:02:23.800 --> 02:02:26.400]  They have no plan to address the trade balance.
[02:02:26.400 --> 02:02:29.120]  They have no plan to fix the immigration problem.
[02:02:29.120 --> 02:02:35.400]  They have no plan to make America safer or stronger.
[02:02:35.400 --> 02:02:37.920]  It's a one-note platform.
[02:02:37.920 --> 02:02:39.200]  We hate Donald Trump.
[02:02:39.200 --> 02:02:40.520]  We want to remove Donald Trump.
[02:02:40.520 --> 02:02:41.680]  We hate Donald Trump.
[02:02:41.680 --> 02:02:42.680]  They have nothing else.
[02:02:42.680 --> 02:02:43.680]  Why are they so lazy?
[02:02:43.680 --> 02:02:48.040]  Like, even their lawsuits against us are just haphazard, like idiots wrote them.
[02:02:48.040 --> 02:02:52.480]  I mean, well, the Democrats are really that dumb, but how do they ever get control?
[02:02:52.480 --> 02:02:55.040]  The party has no soul and it has no core.
[02:02:55.040 --> 02:02:57.920]  It's a strung together group of special interest groups.
[02:02:57.920 --> 02:03:00.480]  It's a broken coalition strategy.
[02:03:00.480 --> 02:03:02.480]  It's a bunch of broken up groups, atomized.
[02:03:02.480 --> 02:03:06.560]  And they can't get rid of the face of their party, Nancy Pelosi, Hillary Clinton.
[02:03:06.560 --> 02:03:08.920]  These people are losers.
[02:03:08.920 --> 02:03:15.320]  If the Republicans run on peace and prosperity, job creation and prosperity, peace with North
[02:03:15.320 --> 02:03:18.000]  Korea and prosperity, we will win.
[02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:22.360]  They don't have anything to run on other than pure hatred for Donald Trump.
[02:03:22.360 --> 02:03:25.240]  And by the way, I know you've talked to the president and others.
[02:03:25.240 --> 02:03:28.680]  You've really pushed, like he didn't even understand what Sessions was doing, killing
[02:03:28.680 --> 02:03:29.680]  him.
[02:03:29.680 --> 02:03:32.440]  And then when Trump comes out and says, the criminalized marijuana, let the states control
[02:03:32.440 --> 02:03:36.960]  it, which should be a gigantor win, something Obama didn't even do, zero coverage.
[02:03:36.960 --> 02:03:39.840]  I mean, like one article, that is so seismic.
[02:03:39.840 --> 02:03:41.000]  Let's talk about that when we come back.
[02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:42.000]  Yeah, absolutely right.
[02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:49.120]  I'm going to get into the whole nexium cult, which you did some limited for two months
[02:03:49.120 --> 02:03:51.800]  consulting for, which you never had, which is not a thing.
[02:03:51.800 --> 02:03:54.280]  They're like, oh, Jones, you claim that you're with nexium now.
[02:03:54.280 --> 02:03:55.920]  Well, they have a lot of businesses, a lot of things.
[02:03:55.920 --> 02:03:58.280]  I've never worked with nexium, but we're going to talk about that.
[02:03:58.280 --> 02:03:59.280]  I'm glad you're here.
[02:03:59.280 --> 02:04:02.680]  You're more than happy to give us from a slight inside view.
[02:04:02.680 --> 02:04:05.040]  You were kind of in the doorway of the cult.
[02:04:05.040 --> 02:04:06.040]  What you saw.
[02:04:06.040 --> 02:04:07.040]  Yeah.
[02:04:07.040 --> 02:04:08.040]  I'm happy to get into that.
[02:04:08.040 --> 02:04:11.880]  I mean, they were introduced to me by a Republican state senator.
[02:04:11.880 --> 02:04:18.440]  They had hired Senator Gillibrand's father, Doug Rudnick, who is a well-known and respected
[02:04:18.440 --> 02:04:20.120]  Democratic lobbyist.
[02:04:20.120 --> 02:04:23.680]  I worked for them for about two months and what I found out is they didn't need a lobbyist.
[02:04:23.680 --> 02:04:25.320]  They needed an attorney.
[02:04:25.320 --> 02:04:29.560]  They were upset about some former partner of theirs who had left and they thought took
[02:04:29.560 --> 02:04:32.800]  intellectual property and they, I said, you don't need a lobbyist.
[02:04:32.800 --> 02:04:33.800]  You need an attorney.
[02:04:33.800 --> 02:04:36.440]  You need to be in court, not in front of the legislature.
[02:04:36.440 --> 02:04:40.880]  They could never understand the difference between the state and federal levels of government.
[02:04:40.880 --> 02:04:41.880]  The whole thing.
[02:04:41.880 --> 02:04:42.880]  Stay right there.
[02:04:42.880 --> 02:04:47.440]  I want to come back and kick this back off because it's a doorway.
[02:04:47.440 --> 02:04:54.120]  You were in the doorway of the doorway into the whole weird world of all the sex cults.
[02:04:54.120 --> 02:04:56.480]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:56.480 --> 02:05:01.160]  President Donald Trump says the U.S. is negotiating for the release of American hostages in North
[02:05:01.160 --> 02:05:02.160]  Korea.
[02:05:02.160 --> 02:05:06.440]  President Trump was asked during a joint press conference with the Japanese prime minister
[02:05:06.440 --> 02:05:10.960]  whether or not the three Americans release would be a precondition for sitting down with
[02:05:10.960 --> 02:05:13.240]  the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
[02:05:13.240 --> 02:05:17.680]  Trump said his administration was fighting very diligently for the safe return of the
[02:05:17.680 --> 02:05:20.320]  three captives, adding, we are doing our very best.
[02:05:20.320 --> 02:05:24.040]  As you know, they've been there a long time in its harsh treatment.
[02:05:24.040 --> 02:05:28.560]  Trump noted the case of Otto Warmbier, the American student who died after being released
[02:05:28.560 --> 02:05:30.480]  last year by Pyongyang.
[02:05:30.480 --> 02:05:35.600]  The Associated Press quotes a senior White House official who says CIA director Mike
[02:05:35.600 --> 02:05:40.600]  Pompeo discussed the hostages during his trip to North Korea over Easter weekend.
[02:05:40.600 --> 02:05:44.200]  The official says Mr. Trump is hopeful they'll be released soon.
[02:05:44.200 --> 02:05:48.200]  The president says the face-to-face with Kim Jong-un will likely take place in early
[02:05:48.200 --> 02:05:52.680]  June, but he added that if the meeting is not going to be fruitful, he will respectfully
[02:05:52.680 --> 02:05:53.680]  leave.
[02:05:53.680 --> 02:06:20.680]  That's all for today, and I'll see you next time on MacadooInfoWars.com.
[02:06:20.680 --> 02:06:25.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're back live with Roger Stone, I'm Alex Jones with infowars.com
[02:06:25.480 --> 02:06:27.840]  and newswars.com.
[02:06:27.840 --> 02:06:31.840]  We are one of the number one most attack groups in the country and the world because we're
[02:06:31.840 --> 02:06:37.160]  promoting Americanism, anti-globalism, we're promoting true free market, we're standing
[02:06:37.160 --> 02:06:42.800]  against radical Islam, I'm also against cancer, and I don't like death either, so just I like
[02:06:42.800 --> 02:06:48.640]  pragmatic nice happy things like freedom and the right to self-defense and you know, men
[02:06:48.640 --> 02:06:53.200]  and women and families and all those things that are under attack by the globalists that
[02:06:53.200 --> 02:06:55.200]  want total control of civilization.
[02:06:55.200 --> 02:07:00.800]  So let's walk through three big issues, look into the nexium cult that you did some consulting
[02:07:00.800 --> 02:07:04.640]  for before you found out what was going on back in 2007, and you're an expert who's been
[02:07:04.640 --> 02:07:08.080]  breaking this down on the war rooms, but my audience doesn't know that, they've been saying
[02:07:08.080 --> 02:07:12.080]  hey, ask Roger about nexium because the Democrats are trying to recycle that and dig that up
[02:07:12.080 --> 02:07:14.360]  to attack you somehow.
[02:07:14.360 --> 02:07:22.760]  But Comey Nemo leak contact had special government employee status at FBI, CGE, now they're saying
[02:07:22.760 --> 02:07:25.840]  they only know of one other person that did that, that was somebody that worked for Ooma
[02:07:25.840 --> 02:07:27.480]  Abany, that's not true.
[02:07:27.480 --> 02:07:33.760]  This is an offshoot of infra-guard in the Patriot Act that got over three million people
[02:07:33.760 --> 02:07:38.320]  we know of with special emergency governmental cards, the right to carry firearms in many
[02:07:38.320 --> 02:07:43.760]  cases, you name it, and it's the FBI and the deep state under Bush and the Clintons creating
[02:07:43.760 --> 02:07:47.080]  a private army, basically a private spy force.
[02:07:47.080 --> 02:07:55.200]  And now Columbia law professor James Comey used as a go-between last year to leak the
[02:07:55.200 --> 02:08:00.880]  contents of sensitive memos to the media confirmed to Fox News on Tuesday that he previously
[02:08:00.880 --> 02:08:07.600]  worked as a special government employee, SGE, for Comey's FBI on an unpaid basis, and he
[02:08:07.600 --> 02:08:14.280]  says, I did indeed have SGE status with the Bureau for no pay, Richmond wrote in an email,
[02:08:14.280 --> 02:08:17.640]  well you go to the head of the line at the airport, you get access to all the secret
[02:08:17.640 --> 02:08:24.560]  documents to the office of personnel management, when this federal judge puts the whole database
[02:08:24.560 --> 02:08:30.760]  online for federal agents, of Trump's lawyers communications, he gets access to that, this
[02:08:30.760 --> 02:08:35.240]  is so they can use these go-betweens to go out and carry out operations in the media.
[02:08:35.240 --> 02:08:39.280]  So it's government and the Democrats deep state leaking into media, leaking into academia,
[02:08:39.280 --> 02:08:41.360]  this is basically a spy operation.
[02:08:41.360 --> 02:08:45.960]  Now people are freaking out over this Fox News, is reporting on, for me the bigger story
[02:08:45.960 --> 02:08:53.840]  is Comey going, I never leaked to Congress, and then saying, okay, I gave it to a friend
[02:08:53.840 --> 02:08:59.560]  at the law school at Columbia law, so that the truth would get out, but then he tries
[02:08:59.560 --> 02:09:04.120]  to say, but I didn't leak it, he's an FBI head, he should know the guy that gives the
[02:09:04.120 --> 02:09:07.920]  order to somebody else to give it out, admits he did it to get it out, then saying, but
[02:09:07.920 --> 02:09:12.840]  I had somebody else do it, makes it even more of a capital offense that it's premeditated,
[02:09:12.840 --> 02:09:19.120]  I mean these, these frauds, most of these lawyers, I know more than they do, I know top lawyers
[02:09:19.120 --> 02:09:23.480]  admit that, judges, I mean I'm not bragging, these people are lazy, do I know more about
[02:09:23.480 --> 02:09:27.560]  Comey than he does about the law, and here's why, I'm not just saying, Comey thinks you're
[02:09:27.560 --> 02:09:32.000]  dumb, maybe he's not stupid, Roger, why would they illegally surveil you the president, lie
[02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:35.080]  about it, do all this, they didn't tell people they had surveilled, they had all the dirt,
[02:09:35.080 --> 02:09:38.600]  then say, oh we didn't surveil, but there was dirt, then say they didn't leak, but admitted
[02:09:38.600 --> 02:09:41.880]  before they leaked, and then now saying, well I did leak, I thought you should have it,
[02:09:41.880 --> 02:09:46.280]  but I did through somebody else, so I didn't violate the national security act, I mean it's
[02:09:46.280 --> 02:09:51.560]  like the guy's shot full of holes, they're so guilty, struck all of them, the dossier,
[02:09:51.560 --> 02:09:57.280]  cooking it up, this is, these people have self-immolated in front of us, the only question
[02:09:57.280 --> 02:10:02.120]  is does Jeff Sessions have the wavos, or Trump or anybody, it's not even wavos, they're coming
[02:10:02.120 --> 02:10:06.920]  for Trump, they're coming for all of us, and they're the globalists, so they're coming,
[02:10:06.920 --> 02:10:10.800]  they're bad, that we've caught them, give them hell, why aren't people ready to give
[02:10:10.800 --> 02:10:12.800]  it to them?
[02:10:12.800 --> 02:10:19.760]  The answer, Alex, is hubris, they were so confident that Hillary would win, that all
[02:10:19.760 --> 02:10:24.280]  of their crimes would therefore be able to be covered up, so therefore they blatantly
[02:10:24.280 --> 02:10:30.560]  used government email, government text messages, talking about their insurance policy against
[02:10:30.560 --> 02:10:35.360]  Donald Trump's election, because they were arrogant, and now they think they can lie
[02:10:35.360 --> 02:10:40.000]  their way out of it, this special government status that you mentioned is very interesting
[02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:45.280]  because it is under that, that Huma Abedin is able to triple dip, that she's able to
[02:10:45.280 --> 02:10:50.200]  get paid by the State Department, the Clinton Foundation, and a lobbying firm that lobbies
[02:10:50.200 --> 02:10:54.580]  the State Department, Tanao, the only person in American history who's ever been allowed
[02:10:54.580 --> 02:11:00.440]  to do this, Hillary's friend, well, here's the big secret, they're telling everybody
[02:11:00.440 --> 02:11:05.280]  this, the secret is for good little globalists, they can quadruple dip, and it's done under
[02:11:05.280 --> 02:11:11.800]  infregard, yeah, so essentially you're allowed to break the law, it gives you a special status,
[02:11:11.800 --> 02:11:16.240]  so you're above the law, and by the way he said, oh yes, I have that status, we've created
[02:11:16.240 --> 02:11:21.200]  new royalty. Well, and did Comey tell him to give it to the New York Times specifically?
[02:11:21.200 --> 02:11:25.520]  I believe that is the case, I think when you go back to his testimony he admits that, so
[02:11:25.520 --> 02:11:31.280]  it's not like there's some good things about infregard, where if you've been, say a Marine
[02:11:31.280 --> 02:11:36.280]  for seven years, and then the CIA leading operations for 10, and then you're working
[02:11:36.280 --> 02:11:40.400]  for high level governmental operations that interface with private corporations, I just
[02:11:40.400 --> 02:11:44.480]  like what reciprocal for cops to have guns nation, why we can trust them, the Democrats
[02:11:44.480 --> 02:11:47.920]  are fighting that, we've almost got it, there are people in infregard who have connections,
[02:11:47.920 --> 02:11:52.800]  I'm not gonna get into it, who can carry guns around the country, I'm all for that, just
[02:11:52.800 --> 02:11:56.920]  don't let them have database connection, don't let them be above the law, and then don't
[02:11:56.920 --> 02:12:02.160]  have university professors that have full clearance into the FBI database, no I'm not
[02:12:02.160 --> 02:12:04.640]  for that, does that make sense?
[02:12:04.640 --> 02:12:09.800]  It does, I think at the end of the day, Comey's book tour, his entire launch is gonna turn
[02:12:09.800 --> 02:12:14.920]  out to be one of the greatest public relations legal and political mistakes of all time.
[02:12:14.920 --> 02:12:20.760]  I agree because he's just, he's just, he's sitting there and changing his story and
[02:12:20.760 --> 02:12:23.040]  now showing he committed perjury in Congress.
[02:12:23.040 --> 02:12:29.280]  Well, when he was in New York last week, we had, you know, three dozen Info Warriors outside
[02:12:29.280 --> 02:12:34.480]  with Laura Loomer, I think she embarrassed him, we're gonna continue to do this at every
[02:12:34.480 --> 02:12:35.480]  level.
[02:12:35.480 --> 02:12:37.800]  Oh I forgot that, you guys queue up Laura Loomer, we're in front of Comey, I wanna play
[02:12:37.800 --> 02:12:44.040]  that again, go ahead, but we're gonna be summoning, I think the next one is May 2nd
[02:12:44.040 --> 02:12:51.400]  in Miami, Info Warriors will be there to join us in a peaceful protest to expose James Comey's
[02:12:51.400 --> 02:12:57.400]  lies, help us greet Lion Jim Comey as we call him, and my thanks to the many Info Warriors
[02:12:57.400 --> 02:13:00.360]  who showed up in New York, it was a great time.
[02:13:00.360 --> 02:13:03.800]  Now that's my next issue, now before we go to break, we're gonna come back with a whole
[02:13:03.800 --> 02:13:09.960]  nexium cult and your kind of front room, but you know, not in the deeper annals, two months
[02:13:09.960 --> 02:13:12.680]  working for him, he said four months, but they only had you two months and paid for
[02:13:12.680 --> 02:13:13.680]  the last two months.
[02:13:13.680 --> 02:13:18.880]  We're gonna talk about that, but just briefly, I got told by, people say, oh yeah, right,
[02:13:18.880 --> 02:13:21.560]  well people know, yeah, we have the sources, I mean, we have Roger Stonewriter, you don't
[02:13:21.560 --> 02:13:22.760]  think he has sources?
[02:13:22.760 --> 02:13:29.600]  I got told by high level individuals in multiple federal agencies that the Democrats are getting
[02:13:29.600 --> 02:13:34.040]  ready to stage false flags against their media, against the UN, against the Federal Reserve,
[02:13:34.040 --> 02:13:37.440]  against what's seen as the establishment, against universities, to then say Alex Jones
[02:13:37.440 --> 02:13:39.160]  and Trump caused it.
[02:13:39.160 --> 02:13:46.400]  Now you see, days later, Acosta, AP, Hillary, and a bunch of other grips, those clips are
[02:13:46.400 --> 02:13:51.480]  coming up, they're on InfoWars.com, saying Trump's gonna cause terror attacks, he's gonna
[02:13:51.480 --> 02:13:57.560]  get us killed, we need to ban criticizing mainstream media, that's AP, make it a hate crime, Roger,
[02:13:57.560 --> 02:14:00.800]  while transparent as they're preparing, it wasn't hard for me to predict they were gonna
[02:14:00.800 --> 02:14:06.720]  launch Me Too movement to reboot going after Trump and to cover up for Hillary.
[02:14:06.720 --> 02:14:11.960]  It's a fact, but I can see this, but I've been told by folks in the government that
[02:14:11.960 --> 02:14:16.400]  when ISIS then came out this week, with the image of them machine gunning CNN, the New
[02:14:16.400 --> 02:14:20.520]  York Times and all this, that that's the preparation, they are getting ready, buddy,
[02:14:20.520 --> 02:14:21.520]  what do we do?
[02:14:21.520 --> 02:14:26.760]  They're getting ready to bomb their own facilities and blame it on us, and then we come out and
[02:14:26.760 --> 02:14:33.000]  say, don't blame us, they're gonna say, oh, how dare you deny that somebody else did this.
[02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:38.920]  This entire hysteria on their part is born of the fact that we've got 3% economic growth,
[02:14:38.920 --> 02:14:42.160]  the president is on the verge of a peace deal with the North Koreans.
[02:14:42.160 --> 02:14:43.440]  Best GDP in decades.
[02:14:43.440 --> 02:14:47.080]  They are apoplectic that he is being this successful.
[02:14:47.080 --> 02:14:48.080]  So now we have...
[02:14:48.080 --> 02:14:50.360]  And how great he and Melania look out there.
[02:14:50.360 --> 02:14:56.240]  Well, in the fact that he seems to be handling this Frenchman pretty adeptly, and he's on
[02:14:56.240 --> 02:14:59.680]  the verge of denuclearizing the North Koreans.
[02:14:59.680 --> 02:15:03.920]  They're out of their minds with rage, and that's why they're gonna go to these tactics.
[02:15:03.920 --> 02:15:07.760]  But again, Alex, the overall strategy is what?
[02:15:07.760 --> 02:15:08.760]  Censorship.
[02:15:08.760 --> 02:15:10.520]  It's all about censorship.
[02:15:10.520 --> 02:15:11.720]  Silence Alex Jones.
[02:15:11.720 --> 02:15:13.080]  Silence Imphil Wars.
[02:15:13.080 --> 02:15:14.320]  Silence Roger Stone.
[02:15:14.320 --> 02:15:15.560]  Silence the Daily Caller.
[02:15:15.560 --> 02:15:16.760]  Silence Breitbart.
[02:15:16.760 --> 02:15:23.000]  Silence anybody who's alternative so they can then take away our guns and bring down a duly
[02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:24.000]  elected president.
[02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:29.280]  I mean, I have the articles right here, stacks of them, where it says Silence Alex Jones.
[02:15:29.280 --> 02:15:30.480]  Where's that particular article?
[02:15:30.480 --> 02:15:34.520]  It says, Alex Jones doesn't deserve the First Amendment is the headline.
[02:15:34.520 --> 02:15:36.920]  And this is in major publications.
[02:15:36.920 --> 02:15:40.400]  And they call me a cockroach and a rat and a criminal and all this crap.
[02:15:40.400 --> 02:15:41.680]  They've got their speech to make stuff up.
[02:15:41.680 --> 02:15:44.320]  I don't even have speech to sit there and respond.
[02:15:44.320 --> 02:15:45.320]  That's what we're talking about.
[02:15:45.320 --> 02:15:52.120]  All right, Roger Stone and his view from being somewhat on the periphery of the nexium sex
[02:15:52.120 --> 02:15:55.440]  cult, it's tied to Hillary straight ahead.
[02:15:55.440 --> 02:15:57.600]  You have been lied to.
[02:15:57.600 --> 02:15:59.200]  My name is Kevin Ship.
[02:15:59.200 --> 02:16:02.320]  I'm a former decorated CIA officer.
[02:16:02.320 --> 02:16:06.080]  Finally someone has come out and written what I think is the best ex-Mose on the shadow
[02:16:06.080 --> 02:16:07.080]  government ever.
[02:16:07.080 --> 02:16:12.680]  We're in a constitutional crisis and our government is now being run and ruled by a shadow government.
[02:16:12.680 --> 02:16:15.840]  We've got to get this out because just because you're awake, folks, doesn't mean other people
[02:16:15.840 --> 02:16:16.840]  are.
[02:16:16.840 --> 02:16:19.640]  This is critical to get, to read, to give them a library, to give them a church, to get

[02:19:02.560 --> 02:19:06.960]  I take this, my family takes this, and then it funds the operation with the most hardcore

[02:19:19.320 --> 02:19:22.960]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[02:19:22.960 --> 02:19:25.680]  Yeah, I've actually just run out of my superfemale.
[02:19:25.680 --> 02:19:30.520]  I had a few bottles at my house, and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once
[02:19:30.520 --> 02:19:31.520]  again.
[02:19:31.520 --> 02:19:38.080]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good, and I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[02:19:38.080 --> 02:19:40.240]  So obviously, the superfemale is amazing.
[02:19:40.240 --> 02:19:41.240]  I love it.
[02:19:41.240 --> 02:19:43.920]  Nascent iodine is essential.
[02:19:43.920 --> 02:19:44.920]  Survival Shield X2.
[02:19:44.920 --> 02:19:48.280]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest it's nascent

[02:20:28.240 --> 02:20:36.920]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:36.920 --> 02:20:42.480]  Just like our political and cultural information is absolutely game-changing by the very definition.
[02:20:42.480 --> 02:20:46.720]  A lot of people claim that Infowars is the plague to tyranny.
[02:20:46.720 --> 02:20:49.360]  But you are the enemy.
[02:20:49.360 --> 02:20:52.800]  I'm not a rocket scientist, but I know to go out and check the top scientists and see
[02:20:52.800 --> 02:20:54.240]  what they say.
[02:20:54.240 --> 02:20:59.200]  And they have talked about for decades that a lot of the mental disorders, a lot of the
[02:20:59.200 --> 02:21:05.160]  behavioral disorders, a lot of the autism spectrum disorders are in the gut from the
[02:21:05.160 --> 02:21:11.120]  diets and vaccines that trigger autoimmune responses in the stomach that then create
[02:21:11.120 --> 02:21:14.480]  major toxicity in the gut, causing toxicity in the brain.
[02:21:14.480 --> 02:21:17.480]  No kidding, Rick, a bottle of Jack Daniels, you can kill you.
[02:21:17.480 --> 02:21:21.160]  Well, you eat the wrong things, or have the wrong mold, or yeast, or fungus, or the wrong
[02:21:21.160 --> 02:21:23.160]  bacteria in your gut.
[02:21:23.160 --> 02:21:25.760]  Bye-bye, Bluebird.
[02:21:25.760 --> 02:21:28.760]  Here's a big BBC report today.
[02:21:28.760 --> 02:21:31.120]  Look up the New York Times.
[02:21:31.120 --> 02:21:33.120]  How bacteria are changing your mood.
[02:21:33.120 --> 02:21:35.200]  If you have the wrong ones, you're depressed.
[02:21:35.200 --> 02:21:37.920]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, it's been sold out for months.
[02:21:37.920 --> 02:21:39.120]  MycoZX is back.
[02:21:39.120 --> 02:21:43.640]  It's not just the great probiotics we have at Infowars.com.
[02:21:43.640 --> 02:21:45.640]  The highest quality, very, very affordable.
[02:21:45.640 --> 02:21:48.280]  Just like our information is game changing.
[02:21:48.280 --> 02:21:53.840]  It's MycoZX antifungal, anti-east, anti-candida that goes in and knocks out the walls in your
[02:21:53.840 --> 02:21:58.560]  intestines where these things colonize it and put a slime wall in, that the nutrients
[02:21:58.560 --> 02:22:03.280]  go through, they get what they want first, they colonize you, then they secrete toxins
[02:22:03.280 --> 02:22:06.520]  in you that cause depression.
[02:22:06.520 --> 02:22:10.080]  They can even secrete toxins when they want more sugar.
[02:22:10.080 --> 02:22:13.280]  This is well known.
[02:22:13.280 --> 02:22:18.880]  Newcombe with MycoZX exclusively at InfowarsLife.com.
[02:22:18.880 --> 02:22:23.640]  Did I mention it also funds the second American Revolution?
[02:22:23.640 --> 02:22:27.560]  You can't lose unless you don't take action.
[02:22:27.560 --> 02:22:29.560]  InfowarsLife.com.
[02:22:29.560 --> 02:22:36.200]  Now, Roger Stone, I knew, I remember asking you about this, like a year ago, this was
[02:22:36.200 --> 02:22:39.920]  first breaking, because I knew you lobbied for thousands of groups.
[02:22:39.920 --> 02:22:46.560]  The Nexium sex cult, describing your own words, what it really was, your periphery view, working
[02:22:46.560 --> 02:22:50.200]  for them for a few months, why you got out of it, obviously I didn't know it was a cult
[02:22:50.200 --> 02:22:55.360]  then, and now you've got inside a secretive group where women are branded.
[02:22:55.360 --> 02:22:58.200]  That is out of the New York Times.
[02:22:58.200 --> 02:23:03.040]  Smallville actress, Allison Mack is both a victim and perpetrator of cult sex crimes,
[02:23:03.040 --> 02:23:10.600]  as the blower says, Allison Mack Smith's actress granted bail in the sex cult case, and Hillary's
[02:23:10.600 --> 02:23:11.600]  been tied to it now.
[02:23:11.600 --> 02:23:16.720]  Who is Keith Rainier, five details, we'll go over this, but your view is very interesting.
[02:23:16.720 --> 02:23:22.680]  This was mainly a leftist group, which again, women can't find conservatives to pimp them,
[02:23:22.680 --> 02:23:26.280]  to beat them, to hurt them, not all women want that, but some women do.
[02:23:26.280 --> 02:23:29.800]  They found it with Nexium, but you described what it was like.
[02:23:29.800 --> 02:23:34.320]  They shriveled women, like having their souls sucked, describe what you witnessed.
[02:23:34.320 --> 02:23:40.440]  Well, first of all, they presented themselves to me as a self-help group, having these classes
[02:23:40.440 --> 02:23:43.520]  in the Albany, New York area.
[02:23:43.520 --> 02:23:49.800]  Their clientele all appeared to be wealthier, middle-aged, mostly housewives, but some
[02:23:49.800 --> 02:23:55.720]  men as well, people looking for some self-esteem, people looking for some self-confidence.
[02:23:55.720 --> 02:24:00.200]  But the people who worked for Nexium, the women who worked for them, were all emaciated.
[02:24:00.200 --> 02:24:05.920]  They were all extremely thin, and I did audit this course to see what it was like to look
[02:24:05.920 --> 02:24:06.920]  in on it.
[02:24:06.920 --> 02:24:08.960]  I noticed that they were given no bathroom breaks.
[02:24:08.960 --> 02:24:11.120]  They were given no food breaks.
[02:24:11.120 --> 02:24:13.440]  It was extremely intense.
[02:24:13.440 --> 02:24:19.160]  I met the actress Catherine Ochsenberg there, who briefly audited and then fell out with
[02:24:19.160 --> 02:24:24.840]  the cult now, struggling to get her daughter, India, out of it, I'm in touch with her.
[02:24:24.840 --> 02:24:30.240]  Last week on the War Room, we had Frank Parlotto, who really is the crusading journalist who
[02:24:30.240 --> 02:24:34.600]  has busted this cult wide open.
[02:24:34.600 --> 02:24:38.520]  And I love how you've been exposing it, talking about your experiences, since it came out
[02:24:38.520 --> 02:24:41.400]  in the news, and then the media spins it like, you're involved.
[02:24:41.400 --> 02:24:43.880]  You're exposing it, and then you're a bad guy.
[02:24:43.880 --> 02:24:46.400]  I never saw any evidence of a harem.
[02:24:46.400 --> 02:24:49.160]  I never saw any evidence of sexual abuse.
[02:24:49.160 --> 02:24:51.680]  I never saw any evidence of women.
[02:24:51.680 --> 02:24:55.280]  You were in the porch, you were on the outside.
[02:24:55.280 --> 02:24:59.800]  Because it was clear after two months that they needed an attorney, not a lobbyist.
[02:24:59.800 --> 02:25:04.320]  Their specific complaint had to do with an ex-partner who they believe had built them
[02:25:04.320 --> 02:25:05.320]  and stolen.
[02:25:05.320 --> 02:25:08.880]  Sure, but you told me, but basically, off, not off record, but not on air.
[02:25:08.880 --> 02:25:11.400]  You just said basically it was a bunch of crazy people.
[02:25:11.400 --> 02:25:17.440]  Well, and what they did do, and this was clear, was they would find wealthy offspring like
[02:25:17.440 --> 02:25:23.800]  Claire and Sarah Bromfman of the very wealthy Bromfman family in New York, and then they
[02:25:23.800 --> 02:25:26.240]  would suck money from them.
[02:25:26.240 --> 02:25:27.840]  They're embroiled in many lawsuits.
[02:25:27.840 --> 02:25:33.560]  So sucking money off liberal women, and I guess liberal women don't like men that they've
[02:25:33.560 --> 02:25:36.320]  been trained to, and don't like men that are nice to them.
[02:25:36.320 --> 02:25:38.680]  So I guess that's the ultimate fetish, is being cucked.
[02:25:38.680 --> 02:25:41.920]  So these women, a lot of them went in to be abused.
[02:25:41.920 --> 02:25:43.240]  It's totally sick.
[02:25:43.240 --> 02:25:47.560]  It was very clear that the Bromfman sisters were writing enormous checks, drained down
[02:25:47.560 --> 02:25:50.920]  their inheritance to pay for this.
[02:25:50.920 --> 02:25:58.560]  The famous Keith Ranieri I never met, everybody spoke of him in these reverential terms, but
[02:25:58.560 --> 02:26:02.960]  all I saw was this self-help program that seemed pretty pathetic to be on.
[02:26:02.960 --> 02:26:06.400]  By the way, these self-help programs, I gotta tell you folks, we don't have big meetings,
[02:26:06.400 --> 02:26:09.440]  we don't do big ribs, we don't tell you how to live your whole life, we just break down
[02:26:09.440 --> 02:26:10.840]  facts here.
[02:26:10.840 --> 02:26:11.840]  So many of them are cults.
[02:26:11.840 --> 02:26:15.760]  They've got these exercise cults, and these other things, and it's all like some weirdo
[02:26:15.760 --> 02:26:21.880]  just stating stupid, basic things, everyone just deciding they found the truth so they
[02:26:21.880 --> 02:26:26.000]  can feel really big and smart, and it's like mainstream media, it's a democratic party,
[02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:29.840]  it's like any of it, it's not, it's, I mean, pull up the leader of the nexium cult.
[02:26:29.840 --> 02:26:33.320]  I mean, this guy, this guy looks like a complete moron.
[02:26:33.320 --> 02:26:39.120]  I mean, just look at every one of these self-help guys, has that same stupid, vapid moron look
[02:26:39.120 --> 02:26:42.440]  in their eye, and then other morons go to him, believe it or not, they're gonna get
[02:26:42.440 --> 02:26:44.600]  some moron Valhalla out of it.
[02:26:44.600 --> 02:26:47.200]  Well, and they're extremely litigious as well.
[02:26:47.200 --> 02:26:52.200]  I think you'd find that in most cases, anyone who works for them even briefly ends up getting
[02:26:52.200 --> 02:26:53.200]  sued.
[02:26:53.200 --> 02:26:56.960]  They never sued me, I'm happy to say, but they sued many others.
[02:26:56.960 --> 02:27:01.360]  Doug Rutnick, who's a well-known and respected democratic lobbyist who happens to be the
[02:27:01.360 --> 02:27:06.720]  father of Senator Gillibrand worked for them, I have no evidence that he did anything wrong
[02:27:06.720 --> 02:27:07.720]  either.
[02:27:07.720 --> 02:27:08.720]  They ended up suing him.
[02:27:08.720 --> 02:27:12.640]  I think falsely, he probably figured out the same thing I did, they didn't need a lobbyist,
[02:27:12.640 --> 02:27:13.640]  they needed a lawyer.
[02:27:13.640 --> 02:27:16.680]  I'll tell you what the sounds like to me, you get people a little bit of power, they
[02:27:16.680 --> 02:27:20.760]  get people that want to be around power, so they set themselves up like their power, people
[02:27:20.760 --> 02:27:22.720]  that agree it's the power, and then they go crazy.
[02:27:22.720 --> 02:27:27.720]  I can tell you how many times, it's like the lottery effect, 98% of people, this has been
[02:27:27.720 --> 02:27:32.120]  documented in films made, books written, that when the lottery ended up homeless in jail
[02:27:32.120 --> 02:27:38.800]  or totally broke or dead within two years, but they were targeting the wealthy children
[02:27:38.800 --> 02:27:42.760]  of wealthy parents, that's where the big money was coming from.
[02:27:42.760 --> 02:27:48.160]  The Bromphmans and others, emptying out their inheritance, turning over all the money to
[02:27:48.160 --> 02:27:49.160]  the...
[02:27:49.160 --> 02:27:53.800]  And think of the psychology, you've got these coddled spoiled girls, mainly, and then finally
[02:27:53.800 --> 02:27:57.040]  there's somebody, you're great, you're going to get it, but teaching them they've got to
[02:27:57.040 --> 02:28:01.960]  debase themselves, there's a thrill to that, that's why women go and get pimps.
[02:28:01.960 --> 02:28:06.400]  It's very sick, and they want to belong, they really just desperately want to belong
[02:28:06.400 --> 02:28:12.960]  to something, and therefore their bank accounts get vacuumed out.
[02:28:12.960 --> 02:28:20.400]  Edgar Bromphman Jr., the father, essentially ended up taking legal action against the cult
[02:28:20.400 --> 02:28:27.520]  because they lifted $30 million, this is not small change.
[02:28:27.520 --> 02:28:31.920]  Absolutely, I mean you get around the rich and powerful, they're like, most of the
[02:28:31.920 --> 02:28:36.120]  government are mentally ill, and their kids are all ruined, and then they just got these
[02:28:36.120 --> 02:28:42.600]  weird trendy cults around them, sucking them dry, when common sense and free market in
[02:28:42.600 --> 02:28:49.120]  Americana is the only thing these people need, they need 700 horsepower vehicles, they need
[02:28:49.120 --> 02:28:54.120]  to go out and climb a mountain, they need to have fun, they need to go shoot guns, that's
[02:28:54.120 --> 02:28:55.920]  where they're going to find it.
[02:28:55.920 --> 02:29:02.160]  With that, that's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the
[02:29:02.160 --> 02:29:05.320]  place, and what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[02:29:05.320 --> 02:29:10.800]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in, go to faketv.com and discover

[02:30:55.920 --> 02:31:02.280]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging
[02:31:02.280 --> 02:31:08.680]  listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books
[02:31:08.680 --> 02:31:15.920]  or videos or other material from infowarstore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[02:31:15.920 --> 02:31:20.840]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer, and so it is essential that you purchase the products
[02:31:20.840 --> 02:31:21.840]  at infowarstore.com.
[02:31:21.840 --> 02:31:25.520]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste
[02:31:25.520 --> 02:31:30.680]  with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine, and you cannot beat that for
[02:31:30.680 --> 02:31:31.680]  children and adults.
[02:31:31.680 --> 02:31:35.880]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones, that's my dad, the colloidal silver
[02:31:35.880 --> 02:31:43.720]  and iodine as well, infowarslife.com, or AAA-253-3139, and your purchase of the products stands
[02:31:43.720 --> 02:31:47.280]  with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their
[02:31:47.280 --> 02:31:51.520]  satanic pedophile armies, and that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and
[02:31:51.520 --> 02:31:56.160]  they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[02:31:56.160 --> 02:31:59.160]  They use their media to assassinate real news.
[02:31:59.160 --> 02:32:03.360]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[02:32:03.360 --> 02:32:08.000]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their
[02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:10.720]  narrative over and over again.
[02:32:10.720 --> 02:32:16.240]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance, all to make them march, make
[02:32:16.240 --> 02:32:23.040]  them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia, to smash windows,
[02:32:23.040 --> 02:32:28.560]  burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding, until
[02:32:28.560 --> 02:32:34.640]  the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[02:32:34.640 --> 02:32:38.720]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[02:32:38.720 --> 02:32:45.320]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight
[02:32:45.320 --> 02:32:49.800]  this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[02:32:49.800 --> 02:33:18.800]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America, and I'm Freedom's Safest Place.
[02:33:20.800 --> 02:33:31.360]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of
[02:33:31.360 --> 02:33:32.360]  the Info War.
[02:33:32.360 --> 02:33:37.440]  Well, Mark John Randazer is one of the top anti-flatback lawyers, flatback lawyers of
[02:33:37.440 --> 02:33:38.440]  the country.
[02:33:38.440 --> 02:33:42.560]  And of course, he's buddies with the great Mike Cernovich.
[02:33:42.560 --> 02:33:47.280]  I've got some of the best First Amendment lawyers in the country, and people have looked
[02:33:47.280 --> 02:33:48.280]  up the law firms they've got.
[02:33:48.280 --> 02:33:50.680]  They're like, yeah, no, those are the people that represent the Bushes, you know, all of
[02:33:50.680 --> 02:33:51.680]  them.
[02:33:51.680 --> 02:33:52.680]  They're like, what are you over the Bushes now?
[02:33:52.680 --> 02:33:53.840]  No, I just go and get the best people.
[02:33:53.840 --> 02:33:59.440]  But we filed an anti-flatback or slapback provision in the Virginia case, had a press
[02:33:59.440 --> 02:34:01.080]  conference two weeks ago.
[02:34:01.080 --> 02:34:02.080]  They pulled it on Monday.
[02:34:02.080 --> 02:34:03.320]  They're going to refile it.
[02:34:03.320 --> 02:34:10.760]  But they did a 70-page thing of just insults and lies like they're posting a screenplay
[02:34:10.760 --> 02:34:11.760]  or something.
[02:34:11.760 --> 02:34:15.080]  And then the media goes with that, like, oh, which is like you won your last defamation
[02:34:15.080 --> 02:34:16.840]  case a few months ago in New York.
[02:34:16.840 --> 02:34:19.040]  No coverage once you won.
[02:34:19.040 --> 02:34:22.560]  So they filed 16 fake lawsuits on us last year.
[02:34:22.560 --> 02:34:24.640]  We've kicked out now 10.
[02:34:24.640 --> 02:34:25.760]  They said they're going to refile that one.
[02:34:25.760 --> 02:34:33.440]  But I wanted to get Mark Randaza on from randaza.com, Rand Azza, like Rand Paul, but with Azza
[02:34:33.440 --> 02:34:35.440]  at the end of it, randaza.com on.
[02:34:35.440 --> 02:34:38.840]  I'm going to go over his whole backgrounds and take the rest of the 30 minutes we had
[02:34:38.840 --> 02:34:39.840]  with him.
[02:34:39.840 --> 02:34:42.960]  He's also been a journalist, so he knows all those different angles.
[02:34:42.960 --> 02:34:48.120]  And so he's taught First Amendment law, entertainment law, trademark law, copyright law, I'm going
[02:34:48.120 --> 02:34:49.120]  to stop right there.
[02:34:49.120 --> 02:34:50.620]  He's also obviously a professor.
[02:34:50.620 --> 02:34:51.920]  Where are we right now?
[02:34:51.920 --> 02:34:52.920]  What is their tactic?
[02:34:52.920 --> 02:34:56.960]  We've gotten Roger's take on this, demonize this, then call for our censorship.
[02:34:56.960 --> 02:35:02.560]  Hillary, Acosta, the AP are calling for conservatives to be banned from the airwaves this week.
[02:35:02.560 --> 02:35:06.640]  And if you criticize mainstream media, they say it's a hate crime.
[02:35:06.640 --> 02:35:11.240]  Now, so I see them coming for our speech because they can't beat us.
[02:35:11.240 --> 02:35:15.280]  And to do that, they're going to misrepresent their articles today saying, Alex Jones doesn't
[02:35:15.280 --> 02:35:17.000]  deserve the First Amendment.
[02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:22.880]  Those are headlines today, but to do that, they misrepresent what I'm saying to sell
[02:35:22.880 --> 02:35:23.880]  the idea.
[02:35:23.880 --> 02:35:26.880]  But even if I was saying something horrible, you got to prove it in court.
[02:35:26.880 --> 02:35:30.880]  So Mark, what do you think's really going on as one of the leading experts on this?
[02:35:30.880 --> 02:35:31.880]  Thanks for joining us.
[02:35:31.880 --> 02:35:33.800]  Yeah, it's my pleasure.
[02:35:33.800 --> 02:35:38.680]  And I love the misfits of the lead in music.
[02:35:38.680 --> 02:35:42.120]  Look, this is not new.
[02:35:42.120 --> 02:35:48.880]  There have always been people who have tried to use censorship in order to put their finger
[02:35:48.880 --> 02:35:51.520]  on the scale of the marketplace of ideas.
[02:35:51.520 --> 02:35:55.040]  Right now, it just happens to be the left's turn.
[02:35:55.040 --> 02:35:57.880]  But I would not say that this is a left or a right issue.
[02:35:57.880 --> 02:36:04.240]  There was a time when I was called a raging leftist because I believed in free speech.
[02:36:04.240 --> 02:36:09.240]  Now I'm a raging alt-right lawyer because I believe in free speech.
[02:36:09.240 --> 02:36:13.520]  And that whole time, I've sat on the same rock saying that I believe in the marketplace
[02:36:13.520 --> 02:36:14.680]  of ideas.
[02:36:14.680 --> 02:36:19.760]  I believe that if you want to defeat somebody's ideas, that's how you do them, in the free
[02:36:19.760 --> 02:36:22.520]  marketplace of ideas.
[02:36:22.520 --> 02:36:32.680]  So now, yeah, I am noticing that the left is engaging in what I'd say is legal law
[02:36:32.680 --> 02:36:38.480]  fair trying to shut down its critics, trying to shut down ideas that it's having a hard
[02:36:38.480 --> 02:36:45.440]  time defeating in the marketplace, whether it's lawsuits against right-wing journalists,
[02:36:45.440 --> 02:36:46.440]  lawsuits against you.
[02:36:46.440 --> 02:36:51.400]  I mean, certainly, when you see when the numbers started getting up over 10 all at the same
[02:36:51.400 --> 02:36:57.000]  time, apparently coordinated, they're finding you to be a threat.
[02:36:57.000 --> 02:37:03.680]  I don't see anything that you've ever said that I find so shocking or so terrible that
[02:37:03.680 --> 02:37:10.160]  it cannot stand in opposition to my views that might be diametrically opposed to yours.
[02:37:10.160 --> 02:37:12.840]  That's what America is all about.
[02:37:12.840 --> 02:37:17.640]  And when you have this desire to simply shut down the other side, I mean, let's use something
[02:37:17.640 --> 02:37:24.800]  much more extreme than you, you know, part of the commitment that we've made, part of
[02:37:24.800 --> 02:37:30.120]  the promise of the revolution, part of the promise of the First Amendment is that we
[02:37:30.120 --> 02:37:34.600]  allow all speech, we let the marketplace decide what we're going to believe in.
[02:37:34.600 --> 02:37:41.160]  I mean, that has come to us since all over Wendell Holmes' brilliant dissent in Abrams
[02:37:41.160 --> 02:37:47.400]  versus United States, where he said that people who were organizing against the government
[02:37:47.400 --> 02:37:49.960]  were permitted to do that.
[02:37:49.960 --> 02:37:56.720]  And that time has unseated many fighting faiths, and the power of our constitution lies in
[02:37:56.720 --> 02:38:02.880]  that we allow all ideas to exist and we filter them through the market.
[02:38:02.880 --> 02:38:07.800]  And for 100 years, we have had jurisprudence that has simply built upon that and built
[02:38:07.800 --> 02:38:09.000]  upon that.
[02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:16.000]  And what troubles me is anytime I see anybody coming after that, I have a problem with that.
[02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:23.000]  So it's there for, the First Amendment is there for Nazis, for Klansmen, for Westboro
[02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:27.840]  Baptist Church, for anybody, it's there for the speech you hate.
[02:38:27.840 --> 02:38:30.640]  And look, my nine-year-old daughter knows that.
[02:38:30.640 --> 02:38:34.920]  So why don't the attorneys that are signing some of these complaints or some of the fools
[02:38:34.920 --> 02:38:39.840]  that call themselves journalists who might write a headline like Alex Jones doesn't deserve
[02:38:39.840 --> 02:38:40.840]  the First Amendment?
[02:38:40.840 --> 02:38:46.960]  I mean, that is probably the most anti-American thing I can hear anybody say, and it's not
[02:38:46.960 --> 02:38:48.280]  because it's Alex Jones.
[02:38:48.280 --> 02:38:50.440]  Put anybody's name in there.
[02:38:50.440 --> 02:38:51.440]  Anybody's name in there.
[02:38:51.440 --> 02:38:55.200]  And what's worse, Mark, is that they then misrepresent what I've said, and then the
[02:38:55.200 --> 02:39:00.560]  media only covers, it's like they're defaming me while accusing me of defaming them, and
[02:39:00.560 --> 02:39:04.240]  I agree, this is nothing new, but it's got to be, at least from what I've studied history.
[02:39:04.240 --> 02:39:07.680]  And now you've been doing this 30-something years, and Roger, you've been doing it 40.
[02:39:07.680 --> 02:39:11.480]  It's the most intense, though, I've ever seen attack where they're like, maybe it's time
[02:39:11.480 --> 02:39:12.480]  to repeal the First Amendment.
[02:39:12.480 --> 02:39:14.960]  I mean, they're talking like that.
[02:39:14.960 --> 02:39:23.200]  Yeah, there is talk like that, not just in the civil lawsuits context, but I think we've
[02:39:23.200 --> 02:39:28.680]  all seen attacks on free speech at campuses, for example.
[02:39:28.680 --> 02:39:34.480]  When a conservative speaker comes to speak, whether it's Milo Yiannopoulos or Christina
[02:39:34.480 --> 02:39:42.960]  Hop Summers, or last, just a couple of weeks ago at CUNY, we had Professor Josh Blackman.
[02:39:42.960 --> 02:39:50.280]  There is this belief that freedom of expression has its limits, and those limits are wherever
[02:39:50.280 --> 02:39:52.160]  it makes them uncomfortable.
[02:39:52.160 --> 02:40:00.000]  And I just argued a case in Montana on behalf of a publisher of a Nazi website, The Daily
[02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:07.040]  Stormer, and when I was there, you know, it's not anything on that page that I'm defending.
[02:40:07.040 --> 02:40:09.120]  It's not any of the statements that I'm defending.
[02:40:09.120 --> 02:40:13.720]  In fact, personally, they're not the kind of thing that I would like to see.
[02:40:13.720 --> 02:40:14.720]  I wish they would.
[02:40:14.720 --> 02:40:19.240]  Sure, but if they lose their right, if they lose their right, we lose, all right, Roger
[02:40:19.240 --> 02:40:20.240]  Stone.
[02:40:20.240 --> 02:40:21.240]  He's been targeted by states.
[02:40:21.240 --> 02:40:22.240]  Want to comment?
[02:40:22.240 --> 02:40:23.240]  No, he's absolutely right.
[02:40:23.240 --> 02:40:28.200]  I spoke at Sienna College there in New York last Sunday.
[02:40:28.200 --> 02:40:30.720]  Huge controversy about that program.
[02:40:30.720 --> 02:40:34.640]  Members of the faculty resigning over the fact that we were allowed to speak.
[02:40:34.640 --> 02:40:41.520]  Kudos to Sienna College, a Jesuit institution for allowing all points of view to be expressed.
[02:40:41.520 --> 02:40:44.800]  What we have here is an admission by the left that they've lost.
[02:40:44.800 --> 02:40:46.480]  They can't win a debate.
[02:40:46.480 --> 02:40:49.880]  You speak, then I speak, then you speak, then I speak, and we exchange ideas.
[02:40:49.880 --> 02:40:51.440]  They can't win that anymore.
[02:40:51.440 --> 02:40:54.120]  So their answer to everything is, you must be silenced.
[02:40:54.120 --> 02:40:56.040]  You must be shut up.
[02:40:56.040 --> 02:40:57.040]  And you're right.
[02:40:57.040 --> 02:40:59.000]  There is no, there is no line.
[02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:01.040]  It's whatever makes them uncomfortable.
[02:41:01.040 --> 02:41:05.520]  So let me ask attorney Mark Randas and one of the top, and I slap back, attorneys out
[02:41:05.520 --> 02:41:07.720]  there, I recognize that.
[02:41:07.720 --> 02:41:08.720]  What do you think we should do?
[02:41:08.720 --> 02:41:10.040]  I mean, I've got a counter to them all.
[02:41:10.040 --> 02:41:11.040]  I'm doing it.
[02:41:11.040 --> 02:41:13.120]  They're kind of freaking out that I'm fighting back.
[02:41:13.120 --> 02:41:15.000]  I mean, what do you, where do you see this going?
[02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:17.240]  What do we need to do?
[02:41:17.240 --> 02:41:23.080]  The one thing, the step one is recommit to protecting freedom of expression.
[02:41:23.080 --> 02:41:29.360]  And by that, what I mean is, you know, when I was just, when I'm defending somebody who
[02:41:29.360 --> 02:41:33.560]  a lot of people might find objectionable, I try to remind everybody that the rule you
[02:41:33.560 --> 02:41:40.520]  may set down today for the Nazi applies equally to the civil rights activist of tomorrow.
[02:41:40.520 --> 02:41:44.560]  And you stick a gag in their mouth, you stick a gag in their mouth, you did it yourself.
[02:41:44.560 --> 02:41:45.560]  Exactly right.
[02:41:45.560 --> 02:41:46.560]  Yeah.
[02:41:46.560 --> 02:41:50.400]  Or, you know, any stick you made, you may decide to bring in is going to be used to
[02:41:50.400 --> 02:41:51.400]  beat you.
[02:41:51.400 --> 02:41:55.440]  And so remember that you need to recommit to freedom of expression.
[02:41:55.440 --> 02:42:02.120]  And I say this because I've been very pleased by people on the right, for example, when
[02:42:02.120 --> 02:42:07.360]  this professor recently ran to Gerard who came out and was saying, you know, these really
[02:42:07.360 --> 02:42:10.520]  kind of terrible things about Barbara Bush.
[02:42:10.520 --> 02:42:11.520]  The timing was wrong.
[02:42:11.520 --> 02:42:12.920]  It was in bad taste.
[02:42:12.920 --> 02:42:18.160]  Frankly, I found it abhorrent and, you know, I'm no fan of the Bushes, but I don't think
[02:42:18.160 --> 02:42:23.320]  the time to express that is when they're in mourning, especially when it's personal attacks.
[02:42:23.320 --> 02:42:30.280]  And I saw many conservative commentators and journalists stand up for her free speech rights.
[02:42:30.280 --> 02:42:34.000]  That was a good move because you don't find that same thing.
[02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:37.000]  Well, they have the right to say that it was in bad taste, you know, you said some bad
[02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:38.000]  things as well.
[02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:41.880]  But your, but the whole point is, is that that's what it comes down to about Roger Stone
[02:42:41.880 --> 02:42:42.880]  right here.
[02:42:42.880 --> 02:42:45.880]  You're absolutely right that you've got to protect everybody's speech.
[02:42:45.880 --> 02:42:49.240]  I don't think it's good luck to speak ill of the newly dead.
[02:42:49.240 --> 02:42:51.200]  But Barbara Bush is a saint, by the way, Roger.
[02:42:51.200 --> 02:42:52.200]  You've been a bad person.
[02:42:52.200 --> 02:42:53.200]  We'll be right back.
[02:42:53.200 --> 02:42:55.200]  Stay with us.
[02:42:55.200 --> 02:43:00.600]  Info Wars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[02:43:00.600 --> 02:43:05.880]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[02:43:05.880 --> 02:43:12.640]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[02:43:12.640 --> 02:43:18.480]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[02:43:18.480 --> 02:43:21.800]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[02:43:21.800 --> 02:43:26.440]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the
[02:43:26.440 --> 02:43:31.800]  fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[02:43:31.800 --> 02:43:32.800]  symptoms.
[02:43:32.800 --> 02:43:35.480]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[02:43:35.480 --> 02:43:36.480]  It is not an antihistamine.
[02:43:36.480 --> 02:43:41.400]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[02:43:41.400 --> 02:43:47.200]  triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[02:43:47.200 --> 02:43:49.880]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[02:43:49.880 --> 02:43:55.640]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[02:43:55.640 --> 02:43:56.640]  I'm so excited.
[02:43:56.640 --> 02:44:02.120]  The new product at infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two month servings filled to
[02:44:02.120 --> 02:44:06.760]  the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[02:44:06.760 --> 02:44:12.240]  This is a heart and brain pill, a new tropic, but it doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[02:44:12.240 --> 02:44:15.200]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[02:44:15.200 --> 02:44:21.120]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients,
[02:44:21.120 --> 02:44:27.840]  but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae,
[02:44:27.840 --> 02:44:31.440]  and I came up with our own formulae, working with some scientists and developers.
[02:44:31.440 --> 02:44:38.560]  On GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone
[02:44:38.560 --> 02:44:44.000]  to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the
[02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:45.680]  hormones in your glands.
[02:44:45.680 --> 02:44:48.480]  It is amazing.
[02:44:48.480 --> 02:44:56.680]  Red pill, now available at infowarslife.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.

[02:45:13.240 --> 02:45:14.440]  mustard seed.

[02:45:23.120 --> 02:45:27.840]  This essential mineral is necessary in order to produce thyroid hormones, which influence
[02:45:27.840 --> 02:45:30.880]  every cell, tissue, and organ in the body.
[02:45:30.880 --> 02:45:35.560]  With inadequate thyroid hormones, you may experience slow metabolism, lethargy, weight
[02:45:35.560 --> 02:45:38.600]  gain, and overall brain fog.
[02:45:38.600 --> 02:45:44.480]  Survival Shield X2 and Biotru Selenium work together to support the systems in your body.

[02:46:00.280 --> 02:46:02.000]  in Full Wars Life.
[02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:03.000]  It take hours.

[02:46:08.080 --> 02:46:12.440]  it knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida, it's back in stock.
[02:46:12.440 --> 02:46:15.640]  The real red pill, it's been sold out for months.
[02:46:15.640 --> 02:46:19.080]  It's got the preglinone, that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body,
[02:46:19.080 --> 02:46:23.440]  then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins and amino acids, so you can upload it.

[02:46:34.160 --> 02:46:35.160]  it.

[02:46:40.320 --> 02:46:41.520]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[02:46:41.520 --> 02:46:47.240]  So thank you all for remembering infowarstore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's
[02:46:47.240 --> 02:46:50.680]  already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake and it's so essential to spread
[02:46:50.680 --> 02:46:51.680]  the word.
[02:46:51.680 --> 02:46:59.480]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[02:46:59.480 --> 02:47:23.080]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:47:23.080 --> 02:47:32.000]  I won't miss you and I won't ever take you back.
[02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:39.120]  You know, here's the thing, America has a lot of problems, swashbuckling, free-booting,
[02:47:39.120 --> 02:47:43.440]  libertine, whatever you want to call it, but these other countries, where they go, I want
[02:47:43.440 --> 02:47:47.000]  national healthcare like England, or I want to be like Venezuela, even just like five
[02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:50.600]  years ago, Sean Penn was like, we need to be like Venezuela, Venezuela, they were eating
[02:47:50.600 --> 02:47:54.720]  their dogs three years ago, they're eating people now.
[02:47:54.720 --> 02:48:00.880]  And we've got Mark John Rondaza, who's a really good anti-slap lawyer, and a First
[02:48:00.880 --> 02:48:05.200]  Amendment lawyer, and a guy that teaches law to students around the country.
[02:48:05.200 --> 02:48:07.720]  Here's her with us, Roger Stones with us, we'll have a shot in a little bit of the next
[02:48:07.720 --> 02:48:09.640]  hour, he's leaving us in 10 minutes.
[02:48:09.640 --> 02:48:13.360]  I know I've got lawyers on this, but I've talked to a lot of smart people, they say,
[02:48:13.360 --> 02:48:16.640]  you're a great guy, you've been on the show before, I know you're prominent, and a great
[02:48:16.640 --> 02:48:21.320]  First Amendment guy, but without getting into my cases, what advice would you give me?
[02:48:21.320 --> 02:48:26.720]  I mean, I don't want to have to sue, count or sue these people filing lies about me,
[02:48:26.720 --> 02:48:30.800]  but I have to, because they're going to keep getting minions, the law firms are, to go
[02:48:30.800 --> 02:48:32.880]  after me, Mark.
[02:48:32.880 --> 02:48:38.720]  And then I read these losses with typos, and then they say, Owen Troyer said this, and
[02:48:38.720 --> 02:48:42.800]  then he said, and then they say, kick Daniels, it's not even written right, and my lawyers
[02:48:42.800 --> 02:48:46.120]  go, don't talk about how it's bad, wait till he gets to court, and I talk about it, they
[02:48:46.120 --> 02:48:49.480]  will withdraw the suit and then refile it, and I'm wondering, what are these law firms
[02:48:49.480 --> 02:48:56.280]  just crazily defaming these insane lies, so then it can be put in the media, I guess
[02:48:56.280 --> 02:48:58.120]  they think it's protected if it's in court.
[02:48:58.120 --> 02:48:59.960]  I mean, what would you do if you were me?
[02:48:59.960 --> 02:49:04.040]  I'm just asking you, ballpark here, watching what we're going through, what would you do
[02:49:04.040 --> 02:49:11.680]  against these hordes of raiders coming in to try to take us out, because all I can do is
[02:49:11.680 --> 02:49:14.560]  sue them, and I guess the media is just going to ignore it.
[02:49:14.560 --> 02:49:18.040]  I was kind of worried when I countered to all these folks, that it would kind of look
[02:49:18.040 --> 02:49:22.240]  bad like Jones is suing these poor people, but they attacked first, instead the media
[02:49:22.240 --> 02:49:25.240]  is just, it's like white noise.
[02:49:25.240 --> 02:49:29.680]  So Mark, what would you do?
[02:49:29.680 --> 02:49:30.680]  What would you do, Mark?
[02:49:30.680 --> 02:49:35.320]  Go ahead and pipe my audio to Mark, I think it's, oh that's Skype, Skype is such a magical
[02:49:35.320 --> 02:49:42.000]  thing, but it's just, and it's somewhat the Skype unit in here, I swear, I think we should
[02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:43.000]  replace this unit.
[02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:44.720]  Mark, can you hear me, I see Mark's back.
[02:49:44.720 --> 02:49:45.720]  Okay, Mark, Mark.
[02:49:45.720 --> 02:49:46.720]  Yeah, I'm back now.
[02:49:46.720 --> 02:49:47.720]  You're back.
[02:49:47.720 --> 02:49:49.680]  I mean, you heard most of what I said.
[02:49:49.680 --> 02:49:53.520]  What do you think, I mean, without being my lawyer, I understand, just as a gestalt, what
[02:49:53.520 --> 02:49:54.680]  would you do?
[02:49:54.680 --> 02:50:03.440]  Look, step one is to recognize that our First Amendment jurisprudence, the roster of people
[02:50:03.440 --> 02:50:10.680]  who are on it, who have protected freedom of expression, are by and large conscripts,
[02:50:10.680 --> 02:50:17.880]  meaning the New York Times did not want to be in New York Times versus Sullivan.
[02:50:17.880 --> 02:50:23.760]  So if you are the target here, you have an opportunity, you have an opportunity to stand
[02:50:23.760 --> 02:50:25.360]  up for freedom of expression.
[02:50:25.360 --> 02:50:31.960]  So I would say anybody who finds that they're being targeted this way, recognize that the,
[02:50:31.960 --> 02:50:32.960]  what is the mission?
[02:50:32.960 --> 02:50:36.520]  The mission is to shut somebody up and to get their ideas out of the marketplace.
[02:50:36.520 --> 02:50:40.880]  So it's a sacred right to just stand up and fight for free speech when you've been wrongfully
[02:50:40.880 --> 02:50:46.200]  sued, you're saying it's really a holy duty of your Americana to do this.
[02:50:46.200 --> 02:50:47.400]  Bingo.
[02:50:47.400 --> 02:50:48.400]  And it's a privilege.
[02:50:48.400 --> 02:50:52.320]  Now, of course, those privileges don't come cheap.
[02:50:52.320 --> 02:50:54.360]  Freedom isn't free, as they say.
[02:50:54.360 --> 02:50:59.080]  So I would say that, you know, you have enough of an audience here, I would say to crowdfund
[02:50:59.080 --> 02:51:06.280]  your defense, not only because that helps defray the cost, but, you know, when you
[02:51:06.280 --> 02:51:12.680]  see a crowdfunded defense that raises a lot of money really quickly, the plaintiff's lawyers
[02:51:12.680 --> 02:51:20.080]  might start to see that your amount of support is greater than they think.
[02:51:20.080 --> 02:51:24.160]  The other thing I would make sure that you do is, you know, not give in to any of them.
[02:51:24.160 --> 02:51:28.400]  I mean, this is, you know, I'm not saying anything about any particular case, but when
[02:51:28.400 --> 02:51:34.600]  I see a coordinated effort to try to shut down any player in the marketplace of ideas, you
[02:51:34.600 --> 02:51:41.280]  know, it's a form of terrorism, and I don't use that term lightly, but it is an attempt
[02:51:41.280 --> 02:51:46.080]  to abuse the court system in order to erase ideas you don't like that you're not comfortable
[02:51:46.080 --> 02:51:48.680]  fighting in the marketplace of ideas.
[02:51:48.680 --> 02:51:51.960]  Don't let them get away with it, and, you know, all of your viewers should not let them
[02:51:51.960 --> 02:51:52.960]  get away with it.
[02:51:52.960 --> 02:51:58.400]  But more importantly is people who don't agree with you shouldn't let them get away
[02:51:58.400 --> 02:52:04.920]  with it either, and when you can harness people to get together in order to protect freedom
[02:52:04.920 --> 02:52:09.800]  of expression, people who will say, my tribe is freedom of expression.
[02:52:09.800 --> 02:52:13.680]  Not my tribe is people that believe in what I believe in or people who don't.
[02:52:13.680 --> 02:52:17.240]  I don't really care whose free speech rights it is that are being trampled.
[02:52:17.240 --> 02:52:21.120]  I will stand up to protect them, whether it's Randa Gerar, who I find to be one of the most
[02:52:21.120 --> 02:52:26.920]  reprehensible human beings in America, whether it's the Nazi party, the KKK, or whether it's
[02:52:26.920 --> 02:52:31.720]  the Communist Party, every one of them has an equal right to be there.
[02:52:31.720 --> 02:52:38.360]  And the intellectual texture of America, the strength of America, the idea of America erodes
[02:52:38.360 --> 02:52:41.680]  and begins to grow a cancer if we don't protect that.
[02:52:41.680 --> 02:52:48.000]  So nobody should be cheering bogus lawsuits against anybody just because it's gonna shut
[02:52:48.000 --> 02:52:50.160]  somebody up that they don't like.
[02:52:50.160 --> 02:52:54.920]  Those, anyone who is on the side of doing that, that's our common enemy.
[02:52:54.920 --> 02:52:58.600]  And that's my next question, that's my next question, is you're a smart guy, please come
[02:52:58.600 --> 02:53:00.480]  on next week for a full hour.
[02:53:00.480 --> 02:53:06.600]  Why do they put in the news articles quoting lawyers, he's bad, we wanna bankrupt him and
[02:53:06.600 --> 02:53:11.080]  shut him up, and then my lawyers go, don't tell him, that's what gets it thrown out.
[02:53:11.080 --> 02:53:16.520]  Don't say it, but I have to because I have to tell the public, so strategy-wise, while
[02:53:16.520 --> 02:53:19.760]  I wait till it gets to court, that no one covers it anyways.
[02:53:19.760 --> 02:53:24.480]  Like why are the lawyers and the law firms in Georgetown, like saying things I didn't
[02:53:24.480 --> 02:53:28.960]  say in the suits, which we know are frauds, gets it thrown out, and then gets the slap
[02:53:28.960 --> 02:53:35.200]  back as you know as an expert, and then why are they then saying we wanna shut him down,
[02:53:35.200 --> 02:53:40.240]  we hate him, he's scum, they're showing the malice of forethought, intend to do harm.
[02:53:40.240 --> 02:53:45.400]  I'm not a lawyer, top lawyer like you, but am I right when I'm saying, Mark?
[02:53:45.400 --> 02:53:49.240]  Look, people tend to get blinded by ideology.
[02:53:49.240 --> 02:53:56.120]  So when I feel like I am more effective when I'm defending somebody's speech that I actually
[02:53:56.120 --> 02:53:59.400]  don't particularly like.
[02:53:59.400 --> 02:54:04.920]  When a lawyer drinks a little too much of their own Kool-Aid, they become ineffective.
[02:54:04.920 --> 02:54:10.480]  When I saw the case against you had been filed by, of all things, a public interest clinic
[02:54:10.480 --> 02:54:17.440]  at my, sorry to say, my alma mater, where they're actually using a public interest clinic,
[02:54:17.440 --> 02:54:23.400]  a so-called civil rights clinic in order to go after somebody else's civil liberties.
[02:54:23.400 --> 02:54:28.840]  It's pretty obvious that the people running the clinic are pretty ideologically driven,
[02:54:28.840 --> 02:54:32.400]  and they are not driven by doing what I think is the right thing.
[02:54:32.400 --> 02:54:36.960]  So look, they're gonna put ideological crap in there.
[02:54:36.960 --> 02:54:43.640]  It's not that uncommon to do that if you can find a way to control the narrative in a case
[02:54:43.640 --> 02:54:44.880]  like this.
[02:54:44.880 --> 02:54:47.120]  It's not a bad strategy.
[02:54:47.120 --> 02:54:51.520]  They're writing this complaint so that journalists that are sympathetic to them pick it up and
[02:54:51.520 --> 02:54:52.520]  write about it.
[02:54:52.520 --> 02:54:53.520]  It's not a terrible strategy.
[02:54:53.520 --> 02:54:58.760]  Sure, it influenced the jury, but they say times, they say, I, I said this guy killed
[02:54:58.760 --> 02:54:59.760]  the woman.
[02:54:59.760 --> 02:55:04.480]  I said Soros funding Antifa and the police standing down created the melee that allowed
[02:55:04.480 --> 02:55:05.480]  it.
[02:55:05.480 --> 02:55:06.480]  I didn't say that.
[02:55:06.480 --> 02:55:08.440]  A photographer killed the woman.
[02:55:08.440 --> 02:55:13.280]  Well, you know, I don't want to, I'm not representing that I want to get into that
[02:55:13.280 --> 02:55:19.440]  very lawsuit, but I will say that if you, uh, there, if somebody wants to write a defamation
[02:55:19.440 --> 02:55:24.440]  complaint in order to hold someone responsible for something they've said, you got to be pretty
[02:55:24.440 --> 02:55:28.520]  careful to make sure that exactly what it is.
[02:55:28.520 --> 02:55:32.200]  Well, there can be defamation just as a general principle.
[02:55:32.200 --> 02:55:37.840]  There can be defamation by implication, but if you do that, uh, it's a much harder standard
[02:55:37.840 --> 02:55:38.840]  to meet.
[02:55:38.840 --> 02:55:44.440]  Um, so, you know, I did look at this complaint, uh, you know, I, I didn't find it to be particularly
[02:55:44.440 --> 02:55:50.440]  well done just as a, just, just from a point of view of a critique of the art of writing
[02:55:50.440 --> 02:55:51.440]  a complaint.
[02:55:51.440 --> 02:55:56.160]  Uh, it did seem to be more ideologically driven than legally driven.
[02:55:56.160 --> 02:56:00.680]  And, uh, you know, I, I hope that your lawyers are, are able to point that out to the judge
[02:56:00.680 --> 02:56:01.680]  and the judge.
[02:56:01.680 --> 02:56:02.680]  Let's be clear.
[02:56:02.680 --> 02:56:05.240]  They've already pulled, they've already pulled the first version.
[02:56:05.240 --> 02:56:08.320]  They say they're going to file another one, but we're just waiting with crickets playing.
[02:56:08.320 --> 02:56:09.320]  They've been pulled.
[02:56:09.320 --> 02:56:15.120]  Well, you know, maybe they will, maybe they'll clean it up, but you know, you have a, this
[02:56:15.120 --> 02:56:21.680]  is just one of many cases across the country where you have problems like this, you know,
[02:56:21.680 --> 02:56:26.600]  the, the ideological left is currently, you know, and, and it wasn't this way 15 years
[02:56:26.600 --> 02:56:31.080]  ago, 15 years ago, the ideological left were the champions of free speech.
[02:56:31.080 --> 02:56:33.840]  And I was screaming at people on the right saying, what the hell are you doing?
[02:56:33.840 --> 02:56:34.840]  Me too.
[02:56:34.840 --> 02:56:35.840]  I'm still screaming.
[02:56:35.840 --> 02:56:37.720]  I just had to turn and scream in a different direction.
[02:56:37.720 --> 02:56:38.720]  I'm still that crazy.
[02:56:38.720 --> 02:56:39.720]  Let me ask you this question.
[02:56:39.720 --> 02:56:41.600]  Then Mark, when does it hit rock bottom?
[02:56:41.600 --> 02:56:46.520]  Because I see just cheerleading everywhere saying silence, Trump criticizing the media,
[02:56:46.520 --> 02:56:49.560]  take speech, silence, Alex Jones today.
[02:56:49.560 --> 02:56:52.160]  And we're, he's going to get journalists killed.
[02:56:52.160 --> 02:56:53.640]  They're attacking us.
[02:56:53.640 --> 02:56:57.640]  We attack back and they say silence us and it's major publications.
[02:56:57.640 --> 02:56:58.640]  That's dangerous.
[02:56:58.640 --> 02:56:59.640]  Yeah.
[02:56:59.640 --> 02:57:05.800]  We, we hit rock bottom when nobody wants to defend freedom of expression.
[02:57:05.800 --> 02:57:11.120]  And you know, I find a lot of the rank and file right seems to be saying, well, let's
[02:57:11.120 --> 02:57:13.920]  make the left play by their own rules.
[02:57:13.920 --> 02:57:14.920]  That's when we hit rock bottom.
[02:57:14.920 --> 02:57:15.920]  That's a trap.
[02:57:15.920 --> 02:57:16.920]  That's a trap.
[02:57:16.920 --> 02:57:17.920]  Right.
[02:57:17.920 --> 02:57:22.480]  And you know, as much as it may feel uncomfortable to play fair with them, even if they're not
[02:57:22.480 --> 02:57:28.520]  playing fair with you, I happen to believe that that's the way to constitutional salvation.
[02:57:28.520 --> 02:57:29.520]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:57:29.520 --> 02:57:32.320]  Whether there's some racist black group or white supremacist group that I hate, let
[02:57:32.320 --> 02:57:36.000]  me do it back in 60 second hoodie, five minutes with you, let Roger ask some questions and
[02:57:36.000 --> 02:57:38.200]  I'm going to get Mark on with us again.
[02:57:38.200 --> 02:57:40.240]  He's a really smart guy, but this is about America.
[02:57:40.240 --> 02:57:44.040]  It's not about info wars, but when we win these lawsuits, no coverage.
[02:57:44.040 --> 02:57:47.080]  Remember that Mike and Arizona are on the air worldwide.
[02:57:47.080 --> 02:57:48.080]  Go ahead.
[02:57:48.080 --> 02:57:50.400]  Oh, Alex, you can rent any day of the week.
[02:57:50.400 --> 02:57:54.960]  Thank you sir for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America
[02:57:54.960 --> 02:58:00.840]  and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.

[02:59:49.440 --> 03:00:19.400]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[03:00:19.400 --> 03:00:26.080]  All right, Mark Randas is here.
[03:00:26.080 --> 03:00:30.120]  Rodgers Jones and a cohost this fourth hour he's taken over in a minute war rooms coming
[03:00:30.120 --> 03:00:31.120]  up.
[03:00:31.120 --> 03:00:33.840]  Listen, I don't think of us as that important.
[03:00:33.840 --> 03:00:34.840]  Really I don't.
[03:00:34.840 --> 03:00:36.160]  I promote Americana.
[03:00:36.160 --> 03:00:39.640]  They take my devil's advocate interviews where I say I think everybody died at Sandy Hook's
[03:00:39.640 --> 03:00:41.680]  you know because it looks like the parents are nice.
[03:00:41.680 --> 03:00:42.680]  They're good people.
[03:00:42.680 --> 03:00:43.680]  I want to believe it.
[03:00:43.680 --> 03:00:48.400]  Just don't blame gun owners, but I can see how they had dead babies that didn't die in
[03:00:48.400 --> 03:00:49.400]  incubators.
[03:00:49.400 --> 03:00:52.680]  We launched all these wars and killed millions that the government could run hoaxes or groups
[03:00:52.680 --> 03:00:54.560]  could.
[03:00:54.560 --> 03:00:55.720]  I could see how it's all fake.
[03:00:55.720 --> 03:00:57.280]  Now that's me repeating what I said years ago.
[03:00:57.280 --> 03:00:58.960]  I'm not restating that now.
[03:00:58.960 --> 03:01:00.920]  The media is so deceptive.
[03:01:00.920 --> 03:01:04.600]  They will cut that out and I'm not going to change my speech for them and they'll run
[03:01:04.600 --> 03:01:12.000]  me saying six seconds in a Hillary ad saying that and they take it as weakness that I'm
[03:01:12.000 --> 03:01:13.320]  like no I believe kids died.
[03:01:13.320 --> 03:01:17.440]  They go oh really here's this clip where you said they didn't out of context and they keep
[03:01:17.440 --> 03:01:22.240]  recycling going why won't Alex Jones quit saying the kids died and they just keep for
[03:01:22.240 --> 03:01:27.680]  years playing the old clips and I just sit there and now they're suing me and I'm just
[03:01:27.680 --> 03:01:32.160]  like my lawyer's like oh it's a bad suit don't worry but we got a countersum after
[03:01:32.160 --> 03:01:36.760]  so it stops and I'm just like god almighty I can see the optics of that.
[03:01:36.760 --> 03:01:40.680]  So Mark just other key points the minutes we have here with Roger Stone if you can stay
[03:01:40.680 --> 03:01:44.360]  on their segment that's fine but if you got to go understand other key points about this
[03:01:44.360 --> 03:01:48.560]  critical historical fight because Mark Bailin and other big lawyers on the First Amendment
[03:01:48.560 --> 03:01:54.680]  they said well we've talked to the ACLU and other groups they go oh absolutely this is
[03:01:54.680 --> 03:01:58.920]  protected this is out of control is dangerous but we don't want to get involved we're scared
[03:01:58.920 --> 03:02:04.880]  it's the first time the ACLU that would defend NAMBLO or the KKK which I support their free
[03:02:04.880 --> 03:02:09.840]  speech but I wouldn't defend them let's somebody else do it you know it's like Alex Jones
[03:02:09.840 --> 03:02:14.680]  you can't do it you're right the climate has changed and it's so dangerous Mark.
[03:02:14.680 --> 03:02:20.800]  Well yeah look the ACLU fell asleep at the free speech switch years ago so they I no
[03:02:20.800 --> 03:02:25.680]  longer consider them to be a serious free speech protecting organization and I find
[03:02:25.680 --> 03:02:32.960]  that distressing because for most of my adult life I was a donor not anymore they are far
[03:02:32.960 --> 03:02:38.400]  more ideologically driven and far more concerned about civil rights rather than civil liberties
[03:02:38.400 --> 03:02:46.720]  which are often intention but you know you have a I think part of what you can do is
[03:02:46.720 --> 03:02:54.000]  continue to educate people on what the First Amendment is because I have just been delighted
[03:02:54.000 --> 03:02:59.920]  over the past few years at how much more awareness there is now about First Amendment rights
[03:02:59.920 --> 03:03:07.480]  you know when I became a First Amendment lawyer 15 years ago you know it was sort of an obscure
[03:03:07.480 --> 03:03:13.160]  practice area that only a few people did and not that many people understood and now that
[03:03:13.160 --> 03:03:17.720]  there are lawsuits against people who might write negative reviews of companies there
[03:03:17.720 --> 03:03:21.520]  are people who will get cease and desist letters for Facebook posts you know even the rank
[03:03:21.520 --> 03:03:26.560]  and file American is starting to feel how their First Amendment rights can always be
[03:03:26.560 --> 03:03:32.200]  messed with but it's happening everywhere and it's not just it's not just defamation
[03:03:32.200 --> 03:03:37.400]  suits designed to try to bring down media that somebody doesn't want to have out there
[03:03:37.400 --> 03:03:42.160]  it's not just bogus lawsuits like this but it's also for example my firm is involved
[03:03:42.160 --> 03:03:47.400]  in a number of cases now where people are trying to close courtrooms because they don't
[03:03:47.400 --> 03:03:52.800]  want what's supposed to go on in the people's courtroom to be televised whether it's celebrities
[03:03:52.800 --> 03:03:59.000]  you know like there's a crack down on transparency that even the communist Chinese government
[03:03:59.000 --> 03:04:04.360]  a few months ago praised the US media and government and said good you're learning to
[03:04:04.360 --> 03:04:09.960]  censor and I mean he's like oh we're good with the communist Chinese mass murders in
[03:04:09.960 --> 03:04:17.040]  history patting us on the head yeah I mean look the thing that happens is when you don't
[03:04:17.040 --> 03:04:22.520]  have transparency in government you don't have transparency in the courts you can wind
[03:04:22.520 --> 03:04:26.600]  up with all kinds of abuses and even if you don't have abuses it erodes the trust in the
[03:04:26.600 --> 03:04:31.560]  public I mean you brought up an infographic before about a CNN article I wrote about
[03:04:31.560 --> 03:04:38.400]  outrage over the Google memo well now there's a lawsuit against Google by James DeMora the
[03:04:38.400 --> 03:04:44.680]  author of that memo and Google just moved to seal the whole thing the complaint is no
[03:04:44.680 --> 03:04:50.120]  longer available on the public court website back in 60 seconds let's finish up with Roger
[03:04:50.120 --> 03:04:56.720]  Stone and Mark on the other side say with us President Donald Trump says the US is negotiating
[03:04:56.720 --> 03:05:01.520]  for the release of American hostages in North Korea President Trump was asked during a joint
[03:05:01.520 --> 03:05:06.800]  press conference with the Japanese Prime Minister whether or not the three Americans release would
[03:05:06.800 --> 03:05:11.440]  be a precondition for sitting down with the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un Trump said his
[03:05:11.440 --> 03:05:16.640]  administration was fighting very diligently for the safe return of the three captives adding we
[03:05:16.640 --> 03:05:21.920]  are doing our very best as you know they've been there a long time in its harsh treatment Trump
[03:05:21.920 --> 03:05:26.960]  noted the case of auto warm beer the American student who died after being released last year
[03:05:26.960 --> 03:05:33.520]  by Pyongyang the Associated Press quotes a senior White House official who says CIA director Mike
[03:05:33.520 --> 03:05:39.200]  Pompeo discussed the hostages during his trip to North Korea over Easter weekend the official says
[03:05:39.200 --> 03:05:44.400]  Mr. Trump is hopeful they'll be released soon the president says the face-to-face with Kim Jong-un
[03:05:44.400 --> 03:05:49.440]  will likely take place in early June but he added that if the meeting is not going to be fruitful
[03:05:49.440 --> 03:06:05.360]  he will respectfully leave leon macadoo info wars dot com
[03:06:05.360 --> 03:06:12.080]  coming to you from the former united states of america from deep in the heart of texas it's
[03:06:12.080 --> 03:06:18.240]  alex jones and roger stone is about to take over the rest of the hour and mark randaza a great
[03:06:18.240 --> 03:06:21.920]  lawyer randaza dot com and begin a very prominent free speech lawyer he got into it when it was
[03:06:22.800 --> 03:06:27.600]  very very very esoteric and nobody really cared because we thought it was secure now we see it's
[03:06:27.600 --> 03:06:34.800]  under full assault and i remember again liking liberals because they were anti-war and pro-free
[03:06:34.800 --> 03:06:41.040]  speech i didn't agree with them on property rights or high taxes or you know things like that or
[03:06:41.040 --> 03:06:46.320]  being anti-gun but liberals were free speech i remember hearing like conservatives going ban the
[03:06:46.320 --> 03:06:51.360]  kkk from austin marching and you'd have the acl you found a lawsuit no they're going to march
[03:06:51.360 --> 03:06:53.840]  and i'd go out and tell them they were scumbags there's all the videos of that
[03:06:56.880 --> 03:07:01.440]  but now it's not that it's not just that they don't want your free speech they demonize you so
[03:07:01.440 --> 03:07:07.600]  roger we're about to finish up here with attorney mark randaza but you've got some comments as well
[03:07:07.600 --> 03:07:13.360]  but we were finishing up with the historic battle mark and roger both of you finishing up here
[03:07:13.360 --> 03:07:20.160]  i don't think they'll be successful there's such a history of this here uh the average american i
[03:07:20.160 --> 03:07:24.560]  know of every race color and creed may be lazy because we've lived the freedom so long but
[03:07:24.560 --> 03:07:29.600]  when somebody tries to take something from us we wake up and i'm lazy too and the fact that
[03:07:29.600 --> 03:07:33.600]  i'm actually not intimidated by all this because i didn't say the stuff they said i didn't do the
[03:07:33.600 --> 03:07:38.160]  things they did off record i won't say the suits i've settled a few things over the years that you
[03:07:38.160 --> 03:07:42.960]  know what i think i was wrong there boom let's settle that i'm all about paying up you know i've
[03:07:42.960 --> 03:07:49.120]  got responsibility this stuff i didn't do this stuff is fraud so at your gut level both of you
[03:07:49.120 --> 03:07:52.400]  where do you see this ending and what does the listeners ship me to do mark
[03:07:54.000 --> 03:07:59.280]  well look when somebody says i believe in free speech but you got to stop them right there and
[03:07:59.280 --> 03:08:04.400]  say anything that comes after that conjunction negates the first half of that sentence you need
[03:08:04.400 --> 03:08:10.080]  to stand up for freedom of expression whether it's donating to a legal defense fund for somebody
[03:08:10.080 --> 03:08:15.840]  who might not be able to afford that defense uh whether it's calling somebody out especially when
[03:08:15.840 --> 03:08:21.920]  they're on your ideological side when they're anti-free speech and remember that whatever they do
[03:08:21.920 --> 03:08:26.960]  to somebody you don't like today they're going to do to somebody you like tomorrow maybe even you
[03:08:27.600 --> 03:08:33.280]  so what i what i'd say is we all have to untether ourselves from the actual political
[03:08:33.280 --> 03:08:41.120]  ideology of the day and remain anchored on freedom of expression as a fundamental not just american
[03:08:41.120 --> 03:08:47.040]  value i like to talk about it as an american value but it's a global value i mean i stand up for it
[03:08:47.040 --> 03:08:52.640]  not just here but you know i think uh we all you know back when the charlie hebdo shooting
[03:08:52.640 --> 03:08:57.200]  happened i see that poster behind you i see you got a charlie hebdo exactly i don't like charlie
[03:08:57.200 --> 03:09:01.040]  hebdo absolutely they're really nasty they're mean but damn it they got a right to do it
[03:09:01.040 --> 03:09:07.280]  exactly and if we don't stand up for charlie hebdo you know we don't stand up for you we
[03:09:07.280 --> 03:09:12.560]  don't stand up for you know the the workers socialist daily then we don't stand up for
[03:09:12.560 --> 03:09:18.240]  anything i mean do you really want to live in a country or a world where freedom from being
[03:09:18.240 --> 03:09:22.320]  offended is greater than freedom let me ask you this question you said they're doing this test
[03:09:22.320 --> 03:09:27.840]  is worth threat just and then roger on this why do you think the media is i don't just say this
[03:09:27.840 --> 03:09:32.080]  we don't talk about it enough they're obsessed with us they we're under hundreds of articles a day
[03:09:32.080 --> 03:09:37.360]  sometimes thousands it's almost all lies it's insane they all we reach a lot of people okay
[03:09:37.360 --> 03:09:41.120]  seven eight nine ten million a day if we're lucky usually five million a day you want to make you
[03:09:41.120 --> 03:09:46.720]  know why are they so obsessed with info wars because we embarrass them because we we prove
[03:09:46.720 --> 03:09:52.720]  that they're lying half the time they want to have the only narrative they want to have a monopoly
[03:09:52.720 --> 03:09:57.120]  on political discourse and they object because there's another point of view and they don't
[03:09:57.120 --> 03:10:02.240]  like our and there's one argument they think is i'm so bombastic sometimes i'm weak and so maybe
[03:10:02.240 --> 03:10:06.480]  pick him people accept getting rid of free speech because alex can act like a clown what do you
[03:10:06.480 --> 03:10:13.520]  think mark look i think that uh you know journalism tends to i mean when i went to journalism school
[03:10:13.520 --> 03:10:18.720]  it was almost everybody in the uh in the program was pretty left leaning it's gonna it's kind of
[03:10:18.720 --> 03:10:22.800]  attract people that have a little bit of a leftist streak to them i mean that's why i went into it
[03:10:22.800 --> 03:10:29.040]  i'd consider myself to be pretty far left um although you know they reject me now because
[03:10:29.040 --> 03:10:34.480]  i believe in freedom of expression because you're an actual but well yeah i call myself more of a
[03:10:34.480 --> 03:10:39.440]  classical liberal yeah in the spirit of the enlightenment but you know that's a i'm an
[03:10:39.440 --> 03:10:47.200]  endangered species now but i believe that they are it's lazy you know it's very easy to look at
[03:10:47.200 --> 03:10:53.120]  somebody who supports an ideological view that you don't like try to pretend you're objective
[03:10:53.120 --> 03:10:59.200]  and then use your platform to try to attack them you know it also and if you're in kind of a bubble
[03:10:59.200 --> 03:11:04.160]  where you only interact with other people who believe in what you believe in you like that
[03:11:04.160 --> 03:11:10.480]  adulation that you get somebody a liberal attacks alex jones the next cocktail party he's at everybody's
[03:11:10.480 --> 03:11:15.440]  got you know patent him on the back telling him how great he is um somebody like me stands up for
[03:11:15.440 --> 03:11:19.920]  you and the next time i'm hanging out with my friends in massachusetts i get a whole lot of
[03:11:19.920 --> 03:11:24.480]  i believe in free speech but and then i got to start telling him no shut up you don't know what
[03:11:24.480 --> 03:11:29.360]  you're talking about um and then i have to give an impromptu class on the first amendment when
[03:11:29.360 --> 03:11:35.040]  i'm just trying to enjoy a glass of wine and a lobster but other than that you know we just
[03:11:35.040 --> 03:11:41.760]  have to remember that the war is not about healthcare the war is not about uh you know
[03:11:41.760 --> 03:11:47.680]  senate confirmation the war is not about any of these petty little disputes of the day the war
[03:11:47.680 --> 03:11:54.320]  is about what that constitution means because we signed a contract in blood when we wrote that
[03:11:55.200 --> 03:12:01.040]  and we have decided that that is the contract that we have with one another and with the state i
[03:12:01.040 --> 03:12:06.960]  agree and it's created that we want to raise that contract it's created we raise that select track
[03:12:06.960 --> 03:12:12.880]  that contract is there to protect you and anytime you see somebody that's who speaks you hate
[03:12:13.760 --> 03:12:18.960]  you need to take out that contract that you have with the forces of the government and with people
[03:12:18.960 --> 03:12:24.080]  who are ideologically opposed to it and say we're going to live up to this deal because i want that
[03:12:24.080 --> 03:12:29.840]  deal for me exactly they're trying to get us to get rid of our birthright and they're selling us on
[03:12:29.840 --> 03:12:34.560]  classical tyranny say which one about america having this real freedom created the dynamo
[03:12:34.560 --> 03:12:39.280]  of real discussion it's messy sometimes but this is america and you know it's all it's it's all
[03:12:39.280 --> 03:12:44.000]  we've got and they're trying to take free speech worldwide as he said alex they attack you because
[03:12:44.000 --> 03:12:49.440]  you're not boring they attack you because you're entertaining because you're able to get people
[03:12:49.440 --> 03:12:53.520]  watch and listen to your point of view because you entertain them because you're colorful because
[03:12:53.520 --> 03:12:58.800]  you're flamboyant trust me if you were boring and if nobody was tuning into info wars right now
[03:12:58.800 --> 03:13:04.800]  they wouldn't be suing you all right well listen uh mark randaza thank you for coming on randaza.com
[03:13:04.800 --> 03:13:08.240]  thanks for your defense of all of our basic liberties this great experiment of the first
[03:13:08.240 --> 03:13:13.680]  amendment and we hope to get you back very very soon thank you all right that was a good good
[03:13:13.680 --> 03:13:18.160]  interview uh don't like you said i'm honored to be attacked by this i just hope the listeners
[03:13:18.160 --> 03:13:23.600]  understand like mark said oh it may be inconvenient this is happening to you if they win some of this
[03:13:23.600 --> 03:13:27.040]  stuff it can shut us down i don't want to encourage them but the only weapon i've got is the truth i
[03:13:27.040 --> 03:13:30.720]  can't play macky of ellie because once i start down that road it just you know it never ends
[03:13:31.920 --> 03:13:36.080]  all i've got is the truth and you know we're winning some of this stuff they just keep more
[03:13:36.080 --> 03:13:40.720]  more more which makes you want to fight them harder roger because they're really authoritarian well
[03:13:40.720 --> 03:13:46.640]  it's also why i keep pointing out in the war room and also here we have a new donate button at the
[03:13:46.640 --> 03:13:52.000]  info wars.com store if you're not in the market for one of our great farm uh one of our great
[03:13:52.000 --> 03:13:57.040]  nutraceuticals or a book or a t-shirt but you want to help the fight for freedom recognize
[03:13:57.040 --> 03:14:01.760]  that these legal expenses run to hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars
[03:14:01.760 --> 03:14:07.200]  per case per case uh i'm i'm living it right now i have had no choice but to set up a legal
[03:14:07.200 --> 03:14:12.320]  dnc obama they've all sued you and people say oh we're going to fight tyranny get on the field
[03:14:12.320 --> 03:14:16.480]  we're on the field roger's on the field he needs money you're right we should have a go funding
[03:14:16.480 --> 03:14:20.160]  campaign because they won't let us have one there somewhere else because we're we're patriots we
[03:14:20.160 --> 03:14:24.640]  can't have one we're so we've got to have crowdsourcing we've got to have fund registers for you and
[03:14:24.640 --> 03:14:29.600]  me and everybody because this sends a message they think if they get roger stone they get alex
[03:14:29.600 --> 03:14:35.440]  shone's they get donald trump they can fold the whole thing in don't people get we're the outpost
[03:14:35.440 --> 03:14:40.240]  we're the front line we're the vanguard they get us they think you're all gonna buckle
[03:14:41.520 --> 03:14:46.240]  they know we like to fight they know we're not scared that's why they drool to get us
[03:14:46.240 --> 03:14:51.840]  that was exactly right and and there's two goals here one is to generate bad press
[03:14:52.640 --> 03:14:55.840]  terrible headlines for us the other one is to just break us financially
[03:14:56.640 --> 03:15:03.360]  destroy our families bankrupt us just making a motion to dismiss these phony lawsuits can
[03:15:03.360 --> 03:15:07.600]  cost a hundred thousand dollars so that's why urge people to go to the info wars dot com store

[03:20:07.760 --> 03:20:19.680]  so
[03:20:23.520 --> 03:20:32.400]  so we humans have developed a number of prisons of the mind things that we just imagine to be our
[03:20:32.400 --> 03:20:38.320]  limitations were imagined to be true and it limits what we think is possible and it limits
[03:20:38.320 --> 03:20:45.120]  what choices we make here are two of the biggest ones i talk about this a lot one is the false
[03:20:45.120 --> 03:20:53.520]  belief the history repeats it doesn't it never does it just looks like it because we have this
[03:20:54.160 --> 03:20:59.680]  pattern recognition brain so anytime we see anything that reminds us of another thing we
[03:20:59.680 --> 03:21:05.520]  say well there it is history repeating again but that's not what's happening history can't repeat
[03:21:05.520 --> 03:21:10.080]  because all the variables are changing all the time so you can't ever have the same starting
[03:21:10.080 --> 03:21:18.480]  point you ever had in history history never repeats ever if you think it does you're in a mental
[03:21:18.480 --> 03:21:24.960]  prison if you think it doesn't do you know what happens if you think that history doesn't repeat
[03:21:24.960 --> 03:21:33.280]  it then you can become president of the united states without ever being a politician if you
[03:21:33.280 --> 03:21:41.520]  believe the history repeats you don't even try president trump is not in a mental prison
[03:21:42.560 --> 03:21:49.040]  did he think that north korea was unsolvable nope did he think he couldn't negotiate trade
[03:21:49.040 --> 03:21:53.840]  deals nope he didn't think that did he think he couldn't give people nicknames and win an election
[03:21:53.840 --> 03:22:00.160]  that way with other stuff of course nope did he think he could you know that nobody could talk
[03:22:00.160 --> 03:22:05.440]  about immigration without being labeled a racist and therefore you know their life was over didn't
[03:22:05.440 --> 03:22:14.240]  seem to bother him he consistently shows you that history doesn't repeat where do you get that
[03:22:15.120 --> 03:22:21.600]  well probably it traces back to the same place i got it the power of positive thinking remember
[03:22:21.600 --> 03:22:27.600]  his pastor when he was a kid was norman vincent peel who wrote the power of positive thinking
[03:22:27.600 --> 03:22:35.280]  the power of positive thinking is very close to this it's very close to thinking uh to to the
[03:22:35.280 --> 03:22:41.760]  belief that you're not in a mental prison history doesn't define you you know you you can you can
[03:22:41.760 --> 03:22:49.280]  get into that little mental prison here's another one that i like to look at this is another mental
[03:22:49.280 --> 03:22:57.200]  prison all right that the problem has to be the solution now this will require some explaining
[03:22:57.200 --> 03:23:05.360]  right but it's a mental trap it's a prison if you think that the only solutions are things that
[03:23:05.360 --> 03:23:11.200]  are closely related to the problem i'll show you how that works in a real world situation
[03:23:11.200 --> 03:23:20.720]  first some context when slavery was the problem you could say that you know white people were
[03:23:20.720 --> 03:23:27.680]  essentially the problem for slavery right and it required white people to do something massively
[03:23:27.680 --> 03:23:34.400]  different for slavery to go away so in this case the problem and the solution were very similar
[03:23:34.400 --> 03:23:43.120]  it was white people white people were the problem white people had to change then move fast forward
[03:23:43.120 --> 03:23:49.520]  to the civil rights era again even though everybody was involved in the civil rights right you know all
[03:23:49.520 --> 03:23:55.280]  the every every group and gender and everybody was involved in that but the people who had to
[03:23:55.280 --> 03:24:02.400]  change the most the people who had to pass laws etc were white people so white people were kind of
[03:24:02.400 --> 03:24:09.600]  the problem and white people were kind of the solution too all right but when you get to what
[03:24:09.600 --> 03:24:17.600]  i would call the last mile there's what i call the last mile fog in these earlier situations
[03:24:17.600 --> 03:24:23.440]  it was very clear what had to be done all right you have to you have to get rid of slavery you
[03:24:23.440 --> 03:24:28.960]  have to change some laws you have to prosecute some people who violate the laws so it's fairly
[03:24:28.960 --> 03:24:35.920]  clear what to do what the problem was etc but now you get to this last mile where things are
[03:24:36.800 --> 03:24:44.080]  way better but still lots of things could be far better than they are and i'll give you an example
[03:24:44.080 --> 03:24:50.720]  of what i mean by the fog the fog is where people don't even quite agree what the problem is all
[03:24:50.720 --> 03:24:57.520]  right so i saw i think it was shaun king was tweeting around yesterday some statistics showing
[03:24:57.520 --> 03:25:05.600]  that um i hope i have this right an unarmed black man has something like four times more chance of
[03:25:05.600 --> 03:25:12.880]  being shot by police in in a um you know an inappropriate shooting whatever name they put
[03:25:12.880 --> 03:25:20.160]  on that but i am unarmed remember and nobody has it gone in any of these examples but an
[03:25:20.160 --> 03:25:26.640]  unarmed black man has a four times greater chance of being shot by police now i lingered on that a
[03:25:26.640 --> 03:25:32.400]  little bit because i know many of you are throwing up in your mouths right now because you disagree
[03:25:33.280 --> 03:25:40.560]  with that being true so you actually disagree on whether the statistic is correct now i don't know
[03:25:40.560 --> 03:25:47.200]  if it's correct or not but i know that a lot of you are saying something like this all right
[03:25:47.200 --> 03:25:51.680]  you know some version of this you're probably thinking the people watching this periscope
[03:25:51.680 --> 03:25:57.360]  you're thinking to yourself but wait a minute wouldn't it be true that the greatest number of
[03:25:57.360 --> 03:26:06.000]  unarmed people in general are going to be shot wherever there's the highest crime so wouldn't
[03:26:06.000 --> 03:26:11.680]  you expect that if you're in a high crime neighborhood unarmed people who are innocent
[03:26:11.680 --> 03:26:17.840]  are going to be shot at a far greater rate so wouldn't the poverty rate really be the main
[03:26:17.840 --> 03:26:23.840]  variable here and unfortunately if more black people are in bad neighborhoods they're in high
[03:26:23.840 --> 03:26:29.600]  crime neighborhoods of course more innocent people of all types are going to be harmed
[03:26:29.600 --> 03:26:38.480]  for all reasons now does that explain a way shone king's statistic i have no idea but nobody
[03:26:38.480 --> 03:26:44.480]  else does either i've never seen that debated have you i've never seen an article where somebody
[03:26:44.480 --> 03:26:50.800]  where somebody gave that statistic and then also gave the other side and said well but have they
[03:26:50.800 --> 03:26:57.600]  controlled for this variable maybe they have i don't know but you don't know either so that's my
[03:26:57.600 --> 03:27:06.080]  point there's this fog about this last mile and you know what do you do about it so we're coming
[03:27:06.080 --> 03:27:14.560]  to a point that i think will define the golden age at least in some ways let's see if you can
[03:27:14.560 --> 03:27:20.960]  does that help you see this better in which we're separating the problem from the solution
[03:27:22.480 --> 03:27:31.040]  and what i mean by that is sort of the philosophy you're seeing from kanda zoans and you can google
[03:27:31.040 --> 03:27:37.120]  her if you're not familiar with her she's a conservative african-american woman who's
[03:27:37.760 --> 03:27:45.040]  become a very important voice because she represents a point of view that you don't see as much as
[03:27:46.160 --> 03:27:52.880]  as you probably will in the future now what's interesting is that and what i mean by by
[03:27:53.520 --> 03:28:00.400]  separating the problem from the solution is that the conservative view which kanda's holds
[03:28:00.400 --> 03:28:07.280]  is that society has done what it can do meaning that white people have done what they can do to
[03:28:07.280 --> 03:28:14.000]  make the laws you know as close as possible to enforce the laws etc and that the last mile
[03:28:14.800 --> 03:28:23.440]  no matter no matter whose problem it is no matter who causes the problem this is what's different
[03:28:23.440 --> 03:28:29.760]  it doesn't matter if white people are or are not the cause of the last mile problem they can't fix it
[03:28:30.880 --> 03:28:36.800]  they can do what they can do but they're not really the solution so kanda says i would say
[03:28:36.800 --> 03:28:42.960]  realization is that the problem and the solution are disconnected and if you're still locked in the
[03:28:42.960 --> 03:28:50.080]  past thinking that white people have to do something you know much different you're going to be missing
[03:28:50.080 --> 03:28:56.400]  your opportunities it's a no-brainer a big burkey water filter is the one you need period

[03:33:38.240 --> 03:33:43.120]  projected on a white boy our teacher pale moody has not been seen by countless viewers across the
[03:33:43.120 --> 03:33:49.600]  internet yes i have thought an awful lot about blowing up the white house
[03:33:51.760 --> 03:33:58.640]  it's an actor dressed to look just like president donald trump as he's assassinated on stage pictures
[03:33:58.640 --> 03:34:04.880]  and video depicting comedian kathy griffin holding the bloody decapitated head of president trump
[03:34:04.880 --> 03:34:10.560]  are no joking matter for the secret service a rhetoric that has inspired the violence has
[03:34:10.560 --> 03:34:16.080]  come from the mainstream of the democratic party they're involved in the coup an active attempt
[03:34:16.080 --> 03:34:43.040]  to start a bloody civil war welcome back i'm roger stone sitting in for alex jones and you're on
[03:34:43.040 --> 03:34:51.120]  the alex jones show if you followed our earlier segment we spoke extensively about the democratic
[03:34:51.120 --> 03:35:00.000]  national committee's omnibus lawsuit against the russian state the russian army donald trump's
[03:35:00.000 --> 03:35:09.920]  campaign donald trump jr the president's son-in-law uh jared kushner paul maniforte wiki leeks julia
[03:35:09.920 --> 03:35:18.800]  nassange at all let me be very clear this lawsuit very much like the lawsuits filed against info wars
[03:35:18.800 --> 03:35:29.840]  and alex jones is bogus it's meritless it's baseless it has no evidence or proof all it has
[03:35:29.840 --> 03:35:39.200]  is a crazy left-wing conspiracy theory the conspiracy theory goes like this the trump campaign
[03:35:39.200 --> 03:35:45.280]  and agents for donald trump worked with the russians to hack the democratic national
[03:35:45.280 --> 03:35:53.440]  committee's email and give the information to wiki leeks who published it it's a fairytale
[03:35:54.640 --> 03:36:04.320]  it's a fraud it's a canard it's nonsense but now in this new phase that tyler nixon one of my
[03:36:04.320 --> 03:36:15.280]  attorneys calls a lawfare we don't have to have evidence or proof the allegation is the proof
[03:36:15.280 --> 03:36:22.160]  that they offer and therefore the purpose of the democratic national committee lawsuit is
[03:36:22.160 --> 03:36:30.240]  one fundraising and two the ability to garner a negative headline and that is what this is really
[03:36:30.240 --> 03:36:38.080]  about there's a substantial reason why i think this lawsuit will backfire however remember that
[03:36:38.080 --> 03:36:45.120]  the entire lawsuit is based on the premise that the democratic national committee's servers were
[03:36:45.120 --> 03:36:52.400]  hacked and that the information was lagged to wiki leeks allegedly this hacking was done by the
[03:36:52.400 --> 03:36:59.920]  russians i'm not convinced that the democratic national committee was ever hacked at all counter
[03:36:59.920 --> 03:37:07.280]  terrorism experts like bill benny rey mcgovern and others have said that there's substantially more
[03:37:07.280 --> 03:37:13.200]  forensic evidence that would indicate that the democratic national committee files were
[03:37:13.200 --> 03:37:19.840]  downloaded to a portable zip drive or other portable drive and taken out the back door
[03:37:21.680 --> 03:37:27.440]  isn't it interesting that the democratic national committee has never allowed the fbi
[03:37:27.440 --> 03:37:35.440]  to examine their allegedly hacked servers instead depending on crowd strike which is
[03:37:35.440 --> 03:37:43.120]  a left-wing vendor organization whose credibility is questionable to begin with to put forward
[03:37:43.120 --> 03:37:51.440]  the assertion that the dnc was hacked by the russians therefore this past monday my attorneys
[03:37:51.440 --> 03:37:59.040]  served notice on the democratic national committee that they are to preserve their servers no hillary
[03:37:59.040 --> 03:38:08.320]  style bleaching please because we want to examine them and to put uh uh the entire question of whether
[03:38:08.320 --> 03:38:17.760]  they were hacked front and center because their entire fraudulent lawsuit depends on it uh this
[03:38:17.760 --> 03:38:24.400]  is going to cost hundreds of thousands of dollars i'm experiencing the exact same thing that alex
[03:38:24.400 --> 03:38:30.240]  jones and the entire info wars front line is experiencing this is the new concept known as
[03:38:30.800 --> 03:38:39.200]  lawfare where they file a completely fraudulent completely false lawsuit against you meant to
[03:38:39.200 --> 03:38:47.200]  garner a negative headline and then it cost you literally tens of thousands of dollars just to mount
[03:38:47.200 --> 03:38:56.240]  a legal defense to move to uh dismiss these fraudulent suits this is the new tactic of the
[03:38:56.240 --> 03:39:03.920]  left it is meant to garner negative publicity for you bad press but more precisely it is designed
[03:39:03.920 --> 03:39:10.960]  to bankrupt you to bankrupt info wars to bankrupt alex jones to bankrupt roger stone
[03:39:10.960 --> 03:39:18.400]  what can you do well if you go to the info wars dot com store if you go to our website there is a
[03:39:18.400 --> 03:39:24.720]  button where you can give a contribution so if you're not in the market for one of our really
[03:39:24.720 --> 03:39:30.800]  superior nutraceuticals or a t-shirt or a book or any of the other great products we sell you
[03:39:30.800 --> 03:39:36.400]  can go to the site and send a contribution twenty five dollars fifty dollars a hundred
[03:39:36.400 --> 03:39:42.000]  dollars two hundred and fifty dollars some people have given as much as five hundred or a thousand
[03:39:42.000 --> 03:39:48.800]  every little bit helps every little bit counts alex jones is not exaggerating when he tells you
[03:39:48.800 --> 03:39:54.240]  before it's over it will cost hundreds of thousands of dollars perhaps even millions
[03:39:54.240 --> 03:40:01.440]  to beat back this effort to silence us you see what they want to do is to promulgate the lawsuits
[03:40:01.440 --> 03:40:08.320]  and then use the phony heads up headlines as their rationale for removing us from the internet
[03:40:08.320 --> 03:40:16.800]  removing us from youtube removing us from facebook removing us from twitter that's their game
[03:40:16.800 --> 03:40:25.120]  and we have no choice but to fight we don't look for protracted lawsuits we're not looking to get
[03:40:25.120 --> 03:40:31.600]  into a back and forth where we have to countersue but if it becomes necessary that is what we'll
[03:40:31.600 --> 03:40:38.400]  do on the other hand we cannot do it without your help so please go to the info or store site now

[03:40:46.320 --> 03:40:53.360]  is needed we're going to be taking phone calls in this next hour that number eight seven seven
[03:40:53.360 --> 03:41:01.600]  eight nine two five three nine questions about the dnc's lawsuit questions about the komi book tour
[03:41:01.600 --> 03:41:08.080]  questions about anything you want to talk about the two-way dialogue with info warriors is something
[03:41:08.080 --> 03:41:16.240]  that i think is vitally vitally important uh i also want to mention that there were reports this
[03:41:16.240 --> 03:41:23.680]  morning that the u.s senate will finally take up the nomination of richard rick grannell uh as our
[03:41:23.680 --> 03:41:30.720]  ambassador to germany this is good news indeed rick grannell who worked at the united nations
[03:41:30.720 --> 03:41:37.760]  and under the bush administration as a spokesperson for the united states uh strong and articulate
[03:41:37.760 --> 03:41:46.800]  donald trump supporter in the 2016 campaign a good man whose nomination has been stalled too long
[03:41:47.600 --> 03:41:56.880]  so kudos to mitch mcconnell and to the u.s senate for finally moving this very worthy nomination
[03:41:57.920 --> 03:42:06.720]  we are surprised frankly that the pace of the president's ambassadorial nominations has been
[03:42:06.720 --> 03:42:14.960]  been extraordinarily slow but now finally a breakthrough in the consideration of the nomination
[03:42:14.960 --> 03:42:24.720]  of rick grannell uh and there and there you have him um it is uh important to note that rick grannell
[03:42:24.720 --> 03:42:30.480]  is openly gay and that may be some reason why the senate and some in the senate have stalled his
[03:42:30.480 --> 03:42:38.160]  nomination but finally justice will be done and his nomination will be heard i'm roger stowe
[03:42:38.160 --> 03:42:48.960]  this is the alex joneshow and we will be right back
[03:42:53.040 --> 03:42:58.160]  president donald trump says the u.s is negotiating for the release of american hostages in north
[03:42:58.160 --> 03:43:03.360]  korea president trump was asked during a joint press conference with the japanese prime minister
[03:43:03.360 --> 03:43:07.920]  whether or not the three americans release would be a precondition for sitting down with
[03:43:07.920 --> 03:43:12.800]  the north korean leader kim jong-un trump said his administration was fighting very diligently
[03:43:12.800 --> 03:43:18.000]  for the safe return of the three captives adding we are doing our very best as you know they've
[03:43:18.000 --> 03:43:23.440]  been there a long time in its harsh treatment trump noted the case of auto warm beer the american
[03:43:23.440 --> 03:43:29.440]  student who died after being released last year by pyong yang the associated press quotes a senior
[03:43:29.440 --> 03:43:35.280]  white house official who says cia director mike Pompeo discussed the hostages during his trip to
[03:43:35.280 --> 03:43:40.960]  north korea over easter weekend the official says mr trump is hopeful they'll be released soon
[03:43:40.960 --> 03:43:45.760]  the president says the face to face with kim jong-un will likely take place in early june
[03:43:45.760 --> 03:43:51.040]  but he added that if the meeting is not going to be fruitful he will respectfully leave lian macadoo

[03:46:16.160 --> 03:46:20.320]  michael zx now it's the other side of the equation everybody thinks about probiotics now great they
[03:46:20.320 --> 03:46:24.480]  are for your gut because of toxins in the environment pesticides herbicides but more
[03:46:24.480 --> 03:46:30.400]  importantly than bad bacteria the probiotics help display yeast mold creates slime walls
[03:46:31.040 --> 03:46:36.400]  and once the candida and the yeast and the mold and all that get in there it causes all sorts of
[03:46:36.400 --> 03:46:41.200]  serious issues well this has got a bunch of concentrated herbs in it and compounds known

[03:46:51.840 --> 03:47:00.400]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:47:09.200 --> 03:47:16.080]  you are listening to an info wars dot com front line report if you are receiving this transmission
[03:47:16.080 --> 03:47:24.640]  you are the resistance and now your host roger stone
[03:47:29.760 --> 03:47:37.200]  welcome back i'm roger stone and you're in the right place that's right it's the alex jones show
[03:47:37.200 --> 03:47:48.560]  it was through the leadership of info wars and white coat labs a conservative pro consumer group
[03:47:49.360 --> 03:47:57.840]  that we ended the testing on helpless dogs by the veterans administration we were shocked
[03:47:57.840 --> 03:48:04.560]  to learn that bizarre medical experiments were still being conducted on man's best friend
[03:48:04.560 --> 03:48:14.000]  and in some cases being conducted on puppies as well as young as six weeks these bizarre experiments
[03:48:14.000 --> 03:48:24.000]  included collapsing their lungs drilling holes in their heads inducing heart attacks and so on
[03:48:24.800 --> 03:48:33.280]  there's no scientific reason for these bizarre cool inhumane medical experiments
[03:48:33.280 --> 03:48:41.200]  we appealed through a campaign here at info wars spearheaded by oan schreuer and myself on the
[03:48:41.200 --> 03:48:49.360]  war room to urge people to contact the president and direct him to tell the veterans administration
[03:48:49.360 --> 03:48:59.920]  to stop the inhumane treatment of man's best friend and we were successful in fact when the
[03:48:59.920 --> 03:49:07.200]  veterans administration put forward a new rule that said these experiments could continue but only
[03:49:07.760 --> 03:49:15.920]  with the approval of the secretary of the va it was overridden by a budget signed by the president
[03:49:15.920 --> 03:49:24.000]  that wiped out all of the funding for these bizarre experiments chalk one up for the dogs
[03:49:24.000 --> 03:49:34.160]  now however we have learned that the environmental protection agency under scott pruit is conducting
[03:49:34.160 --> 03:49:43.440]  the same kind of bizarre medical experiments on helpless pups in this case what we are doing is
[03:49:45.040 --> 03:49:52.720]  feeding them lard until they become obese and then subjecting them to all kinds of toxic fumes
[03:49:52.720 --> 03:50:01.520]  to see if they die it's hard to believe that any of this has any legitimate medical purpose
[03:50:02.160 --> 03:50:10.000]  so now we have to move from the va to the epa that's why i'm asking you to contact the epa
[03:50:10.000 --> 03:50:21.680]  administrator scott pruit uh there's his email address pruit dot scott at epa.gov uh again pruit
[03:50:21.680 --> 03:50:34.400]  dot scott at epa.gov and tell him to end the bizarre strange extreme medical experiments
[03:50:34.400 --> 03:50:44.800]  on dogs hashtag dog lives matter so tweet it put it on your facebook post put it up at your instagram
[03:50:44.800 --> 03:50:52.160]  but spread the word we want to do exactly what we did previously which is to empower public
[03:50:52.160 --> 03:50:59.200]  opinion to empower you the individual info warriors and dog lovers across the political
[03:50:59.200 --> 03:51:05.440]  spectrum to tell the federal government to end these archaic medical experiments
[03:51:05.440 --> 03:51:12.880]  that have no medical or scientific value it is time to stop experimenting on defenseless
[03:51:12.880 --> 03:51:19.440]  puppies and that means you scott pruit so one more time let's show that email address
[03:51:19.440 --> 03:51:26.800]  because i want to maximize our impact please folks send an email right now to pruit dot scott at
[03:51:26.800 --> 03:51:37.680]  epa.gov and urge him to lay off of the puppies this is a vitally important issue and it's the
[03:51:37.680 --> 03:51:45.440]  kind of thing that we are going to be talking about more and more on the war room i also want to
[03:51:46.160 --> 03:51:54.240]  mention uh as alex jones did that my next book stones rules will be in bookstores uh may 15th
[03:51:55.200 --> 03:52:03.120]  also be available at the info wars site the info wars store this is an operating manual if you will
[03:52:03.120 --> 03:52:10.640]  in other words it is a book of rules and things that i have learned in a 40 year career in american
[03:52:10.640 --> 03:52:19.040]  politics uh but it's also beyond the political you will learn how much linen to show in the cough of
[03:52:19.040 --> 03:52:26.960]  a well-tailored suit or you'll get the recipe for my mother's basic marinara sauce which is
[03:52:26.960 --> 03:52:34.080]  um the secret to which is sin marzano tomatoes by the way uh and i think you will find this
[03:52:34.640 --> 03:52:41.520]  extraordinarily useful i'm very pleased to say that i have an introduction by tucker carlsson
[03:52:41.520 --> 03:52:48.160]  for stones rules and in that introduction tucker tells a story of going to his producers
[03:52:49.200 --> 03:52:56.000]  and asking to have me on his show and being told no that roger stone is too controversial
[03:52:56.000 --> 03:53:04.560]  now it's important to know that this was not at fox this was at cnn when ty when uh tucker was at
[03:53:04.560 --> 03:53:16.160]  cnn and as i think all of you know i was banned by cnn and ms nbc uh back during the 2016 election
[03:53:17.040 --> 03:53:24.320]  largely because i refused to back down from the narrative of bill clinton's epic abuse of women
[03:53:24.320 --> 03:53:32.560]  and hillary clinton's role in suppressing those women bullying them threatening them intimidating
[03:53:32.560 --> 03:53:42.160]  them into silence strange i could have sworn i was on with anderson cooper just days ago and
[03:53:42.160 --> 03:53:51.920]  that i have an invitation pending from erin bernett and chris quomo and yes even jake tapper so their
[03:53:51.920 --> 03:53:59.840]  ban didn't last very long maybe it's because what i do is newsworthy and i must say that i thought in
[03:53:59.840 --> 03:54:07.120]  the interview with anderson cooper that he treated me entirely fairly it was a balanced and entirely
[03:54:07.120 --> 03:54:14.080]  fair interview and i appreciated the opportunity to push back on this false narrative regarding
[03:54:14.080 --> 03:54:22.080]  russian collusion uh or conspiracy or or a coordination with the russian state in the election
[03:54:22.080 --> 03:54:30.080]  of donald trump something that literally never happened nor did i dine with julie nissange
[03:54:30.080 --> 03:54:37.520]  nor did i uh receive anything including allegedly hacked emails from wiki leaks and passed them
[03:54:37.520 --> 03:54:46.080]  on to the trump campaign a fairy tale a canard as we like to say a falsehood but still part and
[03:54:46.080 --> 03:54:53.360]  partial of the overall efforts of the left to delegitimize this president to destabilize him
[03:54:54.000 --> 03:54:59.440]  folks we have three percent economic growth that's robust economic growth the best that
[03:54:59.440 --> 03:55:07.280]  barack obama could ever do was a point and a half an average we're on the cusp of a peace deal in
[03:55:07.280 --> 03:55:12.960]  north korea the republicans and donald trump are bringing the american people both peace and
[03:55:12.960 --> 03:55:20.320]  prosperity and that is what they will run on as far as we're concerned here at info wars though
