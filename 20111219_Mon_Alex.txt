[00:00.000 --> 00:12.600]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.600 --> 00:32.400]  he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[00:32.400 --> 00:38.680]  here we are locked and loaded another transmission to awaken the planet to the
[00:38.680 --> 00:43.280]  true threats that our republic and the rest of the free world faces big
[00:43.280 --> 00:47.560]  broadcast lined up for you today obviously with the death of North
[00:47.560 --> 00:54.560]  Korean dictator kim jong-il why does anyone believe what state-run media says
[00:54.560 --> 00:59.560]  when he hasn't been seen in a year the reports where he's been dead for a while
[00:59.560 --> 01:05.400]  since earlier in the year when he rolled out the third hereditary dictator
[01:05.400 --> 01:10.200]  that's how you get kings in four or five more generations if this continues in
[01:10.200 --> 01:13.920]  North Korea he won't have much of a population they'll be doing things with
[01:13.920 --> 01:18.880]  sticks and stones but they will call him the king and if the society gets really
[01:18.880 --> 01:23.040]  degenerate he'll be the god king and then we've got some incredible video and
[01:23.040 --> 01:29.920]  audio coming up of fake crying the whole country's at gunpoint basically it's
[01:29.920 --> 01:32.800]  like a two-year-old doing a fake crying when they don't get a lollipop or
[01:32.800 --> 01:36.720]  something all because if they don't show that deference well it's off to a
[01:36.720 --> 01:42.720]  forced labor camp and the same crazed power look in the general's eyes is the
[01:42.720 --> 01:50.000]  same thing I see in our government absolute psychopathic degenerate
[01:50.800 --> 01:57.360]  sycophantic just absolute trash and of course there's societies falling apart
[01:57.360 --> 02:03.720]  just like ours is falling apart just not to that great extent yet so that's
[02:03.720 --> 02:09.600]  coming up we're going to be breaking that down also Ron Paul has surged as we
[02:09.600 --> 02:17.680]  told you to number one in Iowa and now some of the neoconish sites and others
[02:17.680 --> 02:23.920]  are saying it's time to attack and they are going after him and they're going to
[02:23.920 --> 02:28.720]  go after him on the old newsletters which again was like the Internet of its
[02:28.720 --> 02:32.560]  age in the 80s and early 90s where there were 14 different ones he put his name
[02:32.560 --> 02:36.000]  on they've bought every one of them and searched through 20 years of newsletters
[02:36.000 --> 02:40.440]  and guest writers and special addendums to find a few nuggets a few nuggets that
[02:40.440 --> 02:44.400]  I actually respect because I can tell it sounds like Ron Paul in in one where
[02:44.400 --> 02:49.960]  where he's got his name on it where he talks about you know the fact that the
[02:49.960 --> 02:54.720]  World Trade Center bombing looked like a inside job well it didn't look like it
[02:54.720 --> 02:58.200]  was in the New York Times and CBS News that the government cooked the bomb
[02:58.200 --> 03:01.600]  trained the driver and everything I mean just when it's a fact it's a fact I
[03:01.600 --> 03:05.320]  mean that came out on the news because the informant recorded it and blew the
[03:05.320 --> 03:08.480]  whistle because you knew they were gonna set him up he's like oh we're not
[03:08.480 --> 03:12.480]  supposed to build a real bomb and you said build a real one then it's fake
[03:12.480 --> 03:15.520]  detonator then you said no a real detonator so you we could get him in
[03:15.520 --> 03:19.440]  prison and now you're not gonna stop him before the bombing goes forward they're
[03:19.440 --> 03:24.720]  like I know just do as you're told and he recorded them he and then he went out
[03:24.720 --> 03:29.760]  and had a public press conference and played it y'all scared a mod salon so
[03:29.760 --> 03:33.480]  if they want to say that's radical oh my gosh he said the government could have
[03:33.480 --> 03:38.520]  been involved in this then so be it that's the type of stuff that you are
[03:38.520 --> 03:46.640]  going to see here against Ron Paul and in the interest of discussing the
[03:46.640 --> 03:51.440]  campaign because within the campaign you see the different media tactics that
[03:51.440 --> 03:56.760]  are used we will open the phones up today throughout the three hours no
[03:56.760 --> 04:01.080]  guest I might have more months and offer like 10-15 minutes but probably not
[04:01.080 --> 04:04.000]  probably tomorrow because I was telling Sharon no guest today and then I was
[04:04.000 --> 04:10.200]  thinking about this other news here where the federal government is coming
[04:10.200 --> 04:14.720]  out and saying EPA ponders expanded regulatory power in name of sustainable
[04:14.720 --> 04:19.600]  development according to the UN failed conference in Durban South Africa last
[04:19.600 --> 04:24.800]  week they're just saying we declare the power over everything if we say
[04:24.800 --> 04:28.640]  something is a sustainable you don't have it you don't have a house a business
[04:28.640 --> 04:34.840]  and industry nothing we declare total dictatorial power over everything and so
[04:34.840 --> 04:40.000]  we're gonna be breaking that down we have some of the supposed biggest news
[04:40.000 --> 04:45.400]  reports in 2011 we'll be breaking down we have presidential front-runner warrants
[04:45.400 --> 04:49.760]  martial law being established in America we put out that special report last

[07:13.320 --> 07:16.320]  even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could

[08:17.280 --> 08:27.920]  it is Monday the 19th day of December 2011 we're going to be live here for the
[08:27.920 --> 08:33.000]  next three hours and we don't have any guests today because I want to take a
[08:33.000 --> 08:36.920]  lot of phone calls and I want to hear your view on the state of the world
[08:36.920 --> 08:41.560]  where our society is going on the fact that we are in a depression according to
[08:41.560 --> 08:45.840]  every real economic benchmark that's why all these countries are going into
[08:45.840 --> 08:49.440]  revolution and that's why the establishment's trying to hijack all
[08:49.440 --> 08:53.600]  these revolutions from Occupy Wall Street here in the US to the Arab Spring
[08:53.600 --> 08:58.360]  in the Middle East and North Africa the world is going into incredible turmoil
[08:58.360 --> 09:04.400]  this is a globalist Bankster orchestrated world depression to consolidate
[09:04.400 --> 09:10.720]  power and control the next phase is an environmental dictatorship over every
[09:10.720 --> 09:15.960]  facet of our lives have a report on that EPA is now announcing expanded
[09:15.960 --> 09:20.160]  regulatory power in the name of sustainable development over every
[09:20.160 --> 09:27.160]  facet of our lives outside of Congress Congress just passed a bill finally but
[09:27.160 --> 09:32.000]  you know who's gonna veto it saying no you're allowed to have light bulbs that
[09:32.000 --> 09:39.600]  are the old-fashioned type that put off the nice warm glow and aren't the type
[09:39.600 --> 09:43.840]  that have been proven to give people headaches and that have all sorts of
[09:43.840 --> 09:49.800]  other problems that are filled with mercury and so we've got that report
[09:49.800 --> 09:54.000]  but they are completely out of control we have some good news out of China I
[09:54.000 --> 10:01.040]  was watching this unfold last week they have had thousands of violent protest
[10:01.040 --> 10:05.760]  and uprisings in just this last year alone in fact the number I saw was in the
[10:05.760 --> 10:13.680]  BBC was seven thousand plus estimated and now in major provinces people are
[10:13.680 --> 10:18.800]  rising up and actually throwing the government out and the just like our
[10:18.800 --> 10:24.440]  forefathers in 1776 many towns have now had the Communist Party completely
[10:24.440 --> 10:27.920]  driven out and the police departments have been taken over by the citizens
[10:27.920 --> 10:33.760]  the secret police have been who will beat people to death have been attacked
[10:33.760 --> 10:40.080]  with farm implements and killed in some cases and the Communist Party is
[10:40.080 --> 10:44.760]  sitting back in the last week or so doing nothing because they realize it's a
[10:44.760 --> 10:49.360]  powder keg they realize sometimes killing people sometimes running over them
[10:49.360 --> 10:54.460]  with tanks isn't going to work anymore okay because China itself is in a
[10:54.460 --> 10:59.680]  depression yeah the Communist Party is fabulously wealthy the hundreds of
[10:59.680 --> 11:03.320]  thousands that are in the party live like kings the generals live in palaces
[11:03.320 --> 11:07.720]  they run around and demand the wife of whoever they want they engage in all
[11:07.720 --> 11:11.560]  sorts of corruption their companies are allowed to dump toxic waste in the water
[11:11.560 --> 11:15.640]  but if another company is in on the inside track they get shut down for no
[11:15.640 --> 11:20.720]  reason there was an article today about blood in clothing women's lingerie in
[11:20.720 --> 11:24.880]  fact I forgot to print that we print that jaren coming over into the US because
[11:24.880 --> 11:29.920]  the children's fingers are bleeding bleeding so that people get cheat
[11:29.920 --> 11:35.120]  products China villagers threatened to march on government offices that's AFP
[11:35.120 --> 11:39.640]  here's Financial Times Communist Party tested by village protest you read this
[11:39.640 --> 11:44.600]  article they've already taken over the police stations and other areas and and
[11:44.600 --> 11:49.080]  I've seen videos where people with hose and pickaxes charge men with machine
[11:49.080 --> 11:53.640]  guns and the guys with guns this is about a year ago shoot them but then get
[11:53.640 --> 11:58.160]  overwhelmed by people just hacking them up and at a certain point it isn't going
[11:58.160 --> 12:01.720]  to work and what do they do they take their property they rape their daughters
[12:01.720 --> 12:06.400]  they abuse them they beat people to death like our police do and the Chinese
[12:06.400 --> 12:14.600]  just don't put up with it so we're going to get into that report today as well
[12:14.600 --> 12:17.080]  now
[12:18.840 --> 12:27.080]  now continuing with the news here we've got ridiculous propaganda reports like
[12:27.080 --> 12:34.560]  Kim Jong-il dies North Korea rallies around the Sun a year ago mainstream
[12:34.560 --> 12:37.960]  media was reporting he may have a body double and well it's known he has
[12:37.960 --> 12:41.760]  multiple body doubles but that he might be dead or that he hadn't really been
[12:41.760 --> 12:46.080]  seen that they could confirm and in it will now and close to a year and so who
[12:46.080 --> 12:53.480]  knows when some state-run kingdom of corruption kingdom of just absolute
[12:53.480 --> 13:04.080]  tyranny who cares what they say I mean who knows if it's even true and it's
[13:04.080 --> 13:16.560]  like when our government comes down and says to everyone that they killed bin
[13:16.560 --> 13:20.920]  Laden and they give us this ridiculous fairy tale and then the troops that
[13:20.920 --> 13:25.560]  supposedly engaged in the raid their helicopter blows up on the site and then
[13:25.560 --> 13:29.160]  the rest of shield team six a large contingent of it they get packed on a
[13:29.160 --> 13:34.400]  helicopter that blows up and is the single one-day biggest loss of life in
[13:34.400 --> 13:39.120]  the history of the 10-year war in Afghanistan I mean who buys any of
[13:39.120 --> 13:46.360]  this I told you that was a PR stunt I told you that Obama wasn't watching
[13:46.360 --> 13:50.360]  Osama get killed on those helmet cam videos like they said and that that was
[13:50.360 --> 13:55.480]  a staged situation room photo and it all came out it was staged and that I said
[13:55.480 --> 13:58.640]  they get rid of the body and then they threw it in the ocean and called it a
[13:58.640 --> 14:03.880]  Muslim burial and everybody knows that's not true this is ridiculous and
[14:03.880 --> 14:07.880]  you've got to learn to not believe a word that comes out of these criminals
[14:07.880 --> 14:11.760]  mouths I mean Corzine says he doesn't know where the MF global billions went
[14:11.760 --> 14:15.320]  and then the head of the CMT says we were in meetings with him he took the
[14:15.320 --> 14:20.120]  money I'm not gonna go to jail for this guy and it's not even a news item not
[14:20.120 --> 14:24.120]  even a news item people ask how the corruption's gotten so bad the
[14:24.120 --> 14:28.880]  globalist bought off all the media now the alternative media is challenging the
[14:28.880 --> 14:33.600]  controlled corporate dinosaur media that's flailing around and dying so the
[14:33.600 --> 14:39.520]  system is coming in with censorship that's what they're engaged in they're
[14:39.520 --> 14:43.680]  now openly talking about what the 80 inventors of the internet put a letter
[14:43.680 --> 14:49.880]  out last Friday saying the end of the internet as we know it and there's I've
[14:49.880 --> 14:54.400]  got articles today where the internet is being censored all over the western
[14:54.400 --> 15:01.080]  world now all over the western world in fact I have an article here by business
[15:01.080 --> 15:05.760]  insider welcome to the United's police states of America sponsored by Twitter
[15:05.760 --> 15:09.480]  Twitter is completely run by the State Department on record Google is NSA and
[15:09.480 --> 15:14.680]  DARPA and they go on to say because they talk too much about Occupy Wall
[15:14.680 --> 15:18.760]  Street and the reports that they were covering their account was that they'd
[15:18.760 --> 15:22.920]  advertise and pushed with their media system making Twitter big they were
[15:22.920 --> 15:26.480]  told you this has been taken down because you're involved in protesting
[15:26.480 --> 15:32.200]  well why not just live in North Korea or in Egypt I mean everything that we hear
[15:32.200 --> 15:36.200]  being criticized is now starting here because the globalists are gonna go to
[15:36.200 --> 15:40.320]  jail if they don't shut us down so they're going to try they're gonna launch
[15:40.320 --> 15:45.320]  false flags on the internet mark my words it's in the NDA a bill to hand it
[15:45.320 --> 15:49.400]  all over the Pentagon for offensive operations domestically it's already
[15:49.400 --> 15:54.200]  going on but now they're putting it on paper now I want to go to a little clip
[15:54.200 --> 16:00.840]  here from the film team America and this of course was a film that came out a
[16:00.840 --> 16:06.120]  decade or so ago making fun of Kim Jong-il and he would talk to Alec Baldwin
[16:06.120 --> 16:13.120]  ah Alec Baldwin you're very useful to me ah good job you do there come on in
[16:13.120 --> 16:18.800]  his blicks but now he's dead but but but since North Koreans at gunpoint are
[16:18.800 --> 16:23.480]  being told to worship him and and and again he's an example of the scum
[16:23.480 --> 16:27.520]  government we have and the same look that is in his corrupt generals eyes who
[16:27.520 --> 16:31.400]  are on power trips is the same look that many of people in our government like
[16:31.400 --> 16:35.280]  Hillary has in her eyes when they talked about the killing of Gaddafi as he
[16:35.280 --> 16:40.360]  said we came we saw he died quoting Caesar they're all a bunch of chicken
[16:40.360 --> 16:47.000]  neck scum I mean look at this a little dwarf goblin in a jumpsuit who had a
[16:47.000 --> 16:51.880]  seven-story pleasure palace and would kidnap Asian film stars and have them
[16:51.880 --> 16:56.600]  brought to North Korea so he could rape them until they basically died okay and
[16:56.600 --> 17:05.360]  he's so lonely oh you very useful to me Matt Damon Matt Damon so here is that
[17:05.360 --> 17:10.120]  clip to remember Kim Jong-il then we'll get to his worshiping a throngs at gun
[17:10.120 --> 17:12.080]  point
[17:12.080 --> 17:20.680]  I'm so lonely so lonely so lonely and sad real
[17:20.680 --> 17:28.840]  there's no one just me only sitting on my riddles
[17:28.840 --> 17:40.920]  I work very hard and make up great plans but nobody listens no one understands seems like no one takes me
[17:40.920 --> 18:09.240]  so I'm wrong we're wrong there's nobody I can rewrite to feel like a bird in a cage
[18:09.240 --> 18:18.880]  it's kind of Siri but not really because it's fearing my body with rage I'm the
[18:18.880 --> 18:25.960]  smartest most clever most physically fit but nobody else seems to we will rise
[18:25.960 --> 18:35.160]  it when I change the world maybe they'll notice me and until then I'll just be
[18:35.160 --> 18:50.400]  lonely okay and again we put the headline out last night that media
[18:50.400 --> 18:56.240]  announces that the corpse Kim Jong-il is dead is a very good chance on all their
[18:56.240 --> 19:00.320]  military alerts and him not being seen since very early this year and then they
[19:00.320 --> 19:03.760]  thought that was a body double that he was dead I mean two years ago he looked
[19:03.760 --> 19:07.920]  he'd had three or four strokes and they have to hold him up and reportedly all
[19:07.920 --> 19:11.440]  the drugs and alcohol and constant sex I mean he was just completely burnt out
[19:11.440 --> 19:15.840]  and so that's what you get right there and we come back I'm gonna play the
[19:15.840 --> 19:19.080]  audio and video but you got to see the video it's up at prison planet calm and
[19:19.080 --> 19:24.680]  info wars.com of them worshipping him and the Daily Mail says look at the
[19:24.680 --> 19:29.920]  North Koreans worshipping him and crying over Kim Jong-il's death well
[19:29.920 --> 19:34.520]  right off of camera shot they're admittedly all troops with guns if you
[19:34.520 --> 19:38.480]  don't if you get caught without his photo in your house you go to prison and
[19:38.480 --> 19:44.800]  and his dad so what an example of what government is is that it's three
[19:44.800 --> 19:50.760]  generations of communist murdering killers and if it continues it'll be the
[19:50.760 --> 19:57.080]  great-great-grandson and soon they'll just be called king ill and this is what
[19:57.080 --> 20:00.840]  the government is an illegitimate joke

[26:24.440 --> 26:29.720]  arrest and execution it's a Paul Watson blurb the stuff stuff put out on North
[26:29.720 --> 26:34.880]  Korean state-run TV and it's so fake it's like if I catch the three-year-old in
[26:34.880 --> 26:38.440]  the cookie jar and yes it's happened climbing up in the you know pantry to
[26:38.440 --> 26:44.120]  get it and then you shouldn't do that so she doesn't get in trouble it's totally
[26:44.120 --> 26:51.400]  fake it's like Luke Skywalker it's like Mark Hamill playing Luke Skywalker with
[26:51.400 --> 27:03.280]  Darth Vader in the scene so fake they're all out there just like I mean they
[27:03.280 --> 27:08.200]  could absolutely all rejoicing but it doesn't matter you know I say president

[33:46.040 --> 33:51.240]  hour today and in the third hour I'm gonna break down how they're gonna come
[33:51.240 --> 33:55.240]  after Ron Paul I'm gonna tell you chapter and verse how they're gonna
[33:55.240 --> 34:02.120]  attack him what they're gonna do and how we respond with the truth now remember
[34:02.120 --> 34:07.680]  they had people in Kentucky in three cases where they got caught dressing up
[34:07.680 --> 34:12.680]  like hay seeds which which shows the incredible condescension I respect
[34:12.680 --> 34:16.320]  somebody wearing overalls and who's got scrapes and cuts all over their hands
[34:16.320 --> 34:19.680]  they work for a living those are good people they got a lot more street
[34:19.680 --> 34:23.360]  smarts and common sense than all these yuppies combined but they would dress
[34:23.360 --> 34:26.520]  up like hay seeds we wrote articles about this and we actually pointed it
[34:26.520 --> 34:30.080]  out in one case and they got a lot of trouble for it that the Democrat he was
[34:30.080 --> 34:35.000]  running against in Kentucky but these people worked for him and they would
[34:35.000 --> 34:39.120]  dress up like that and go out and hold racist signs up and stuff so and they
[34:39.120 --> 34:44.320]  said he worshiped Buddha's in the water and wasn't a doctor and did horrible
[34:44.320 --> 34:50.600]  things to women and it was all baloney you'd hear he kidnapped woman
[34:50.600 --> 34:54.320]  headline and then days later would come out oh there was a fraternity party with
[34:54.320 --> 34:58.320]  about you know 50 people out of the river and they were drinking beer and
[34:58.320 --> 35:02.760]  acting stupid oh my gosh oh my and the woman said I don't remember even actually
[35:02.760 --> 35:10.840]  saying that I so that's what they're gonna try to do
[35:10.840 --> 35:16.440]  there they're they're going to go crazy and yes they're going to go after him on
[35:16.440 --> 35:22.640]  Iran saying he wants Iran to be able to nuke us and they're gonna say that oh
[35:22.640 --> 35:28.040]  my gosh he said that governments could have been involved in the first World
[35:28.040 --> 35:31.960]  Trade Center attack I mean that's New York Times CBS News but again they play
[35:31.960 --> 35:36.080]  on the ignorance of the public and oh one of his newsletters said that well
[35:36.080 --> 35:41.160]  once the welfare checks don't get delivered people stop rioting well
[35:41.160 --> 35:43.600]  absolutely you burn down the post office you're not going to get the
[35:43.600 --> 35:47.480]  welfare check and that actually happened people burn themselves out and
[35:47.480 --> 35:51.360]  rioting and burning things so so they're gonna try to make a big deal out of it
[35:51.360 --> 35:57.720]  that's only going to drive people to Ron Paul if Ron Paul doesn't do a bunch of
[35:57.720 --> 36:04.240]  apologizing if Ron Paul comes out and says I love these attacks it really
[36:04.240 --> 36:09.480]  means that you're scared I mean we asked Ron Paul to run folks they're gonna pull
[36:09.480 --> 36:15.480]  out everything they can on it remember they got caught not just in Kentucky but
[36:15.480 --> 36:23.520]  at tea party events in Santa Fe New Mexico they got caught in Portland
[36:23.520 --> 36:28.000]  and other places doing the same deal and even advertising on Craigslist in
[36:28.000 --> 36:33.800]  places to find actors to go out and pose as racist tea party people for the
[36:33.800 --> 36:38.240]  cameras and the news put them on TV knowing full well I mean you got
[36:38.240 --> 36:42.360]  somebody with fake teeth on wearing overalls going I want to kill all the
[36:42.360 --> 36:48.120]  Mexicans and I'm at the tea party people know when it's fake and they go
[36:48.120 --> 36:53.520]  research it and find out it is or some little trust fund want to be anarchist
[36:53.520 --> 36:59.280]  methhead you know saying I like Rand Paul and I hate black people I mean it's
[36:59.280 --> 37:06.440]  incredibly transparent so get ready for it get ready for it because it's their
[37:06.440 --> 37:12.760]  condescension when they wear fake teeth and a John Deere hat sideways and then
[37:12.760 --> 37:17.520]  try to act mentally retarded mentally handicapped and it's an insult to
[37:17.520 --> 37:23.520]  mentally handicapped people and I always love how establishment types and want
[37:23.520 --> 37:27.800]  to be trendies and want to be intellectuals always rundown rural
[37:27.800 --> 37:32.880]  people always rundown people in the west or the south folks I've been all over
[37:32.880 --> 37:36.120]  the world I've met people everywhere people are people people are smart and
[37:36.120 --> 37:40.440]  they're stupid no matter where you go they're cunning they're good they're
[37:40.440 --> 37:45.560]  generous they're evil there's there's all types and it's basically distributed
[37:45.560 --> 37:53.360]  across the world and societies go through different cycles there's been
[37:53.360 --> 37:57.680]  incredible barbarism in Korea there's been incredible barbarism in the
[37:57.680 --> 38:01.920]  continent of Europe there's been incredible degradation and dehumanization
[38:01.920 --> 38:06.440]  yeah in Latin America and it's same things happen in Russia but people do
[38:06.440 --> 38:12.800]  the same stuff see humans only live on average 74 years males well it's dropped
[38:12.800 --> 38:22.800]  73 was 76 not 73 76 75 74 73 women it was 78 now it's what 75 even with all
[38:22.800 --> 38:25.880]  the little drugs they give you to treat the things they've given you it's it's
[38:25.880 --> 38:29.600]  not you know it's people are dying and the infertility is exploding and the
[38:29.600 --> 38:36.760]  infant mortality is going back up but going back here humans this is a key
[38:36.760 --> 38:45.200]  point I want to make humans only live 75 years or so and we have this
[38:45.200 --> 38:49.280]  perception that we've always been here because the species has been here for a
[38:49.280 --> 38:53.400]  long time we are connected to the universe we have this feeling of
[38:53.400 --> 39:01.800]  timelessness like we've always been here and this feeling of just belonging to
[39:01.800 --> 39:05.840]  humanity and we see all the old buildings and the old paintings and we
[39:05.840 --> 39:11.320]  we see we get nostalgic when we see old photos of people that you know died 150
[39:11.320 --> 39:18.920]  years ago and people who are competitive and jealous and envious
[39:18.920 --> 39:24.000]  they always love somebody after they die a painter who dies or a sports person
[39:24.000 --> 39:27.280]  even their detractors tend to like them after they're dead because now they're
[39:27.280 --> 39:34.120]  not here in this world now they're not making small people feel smaller those
[39:34.120 --> 39:38.800]  that are truly alive and have reached some level of development and wisdom
[39:38.800 --> 39:43.000]  understand that it is through the species we live on they were individuals
[39:43.000 --> 39:49.200]  and through our individualism we add to the greater time continuum collective
[39:49.200 --> 39:57.760]  of life on this planet and our species not a forced collectivism but a true
[39:57.760 --> 40:03.760]  independent collectivism and it is through our vigor individually it is
[40:03.760 --> 40:08.160]  through our courage it is through our exploration it is through our reaching
[40:08.160 --> 40:15.680]  outward towards the future species and reaching back for knowledge of our
[40:15.680 --> 40:20.640]  ancestors that we hold the space-time continuum in our hands and do live
[40:20.640 --> 40:25.280]  forever even if you don't believe that there is an essence in a spirit the
[40:25.280 --> 40:34.400]  essence in the spirit is undoubtedly at one level this third-dimensional system
[40:34.400 --> 40:40.160]  that we're in right now and that's why I'm not afraid to die I'm not looking
[40:40.160 --> 40:46.040]  forward to it I'm not looking forward to walking around the corner sometimes
[40:46.040 --> 40:49.440]  somewhere and somebody shoots me between the eyes or puts a tourniquet around my
[40:49.440 --> 40:53.280]  neck or poisons me or whatever it is or takes me in diesel treatments me drives
[40:53.280 --> 40:56.320]  me around for months till they psychologically break me stop my guts
[40:56.320 --> 41:01.680]  out but I feel more sorry for those fallen creatures that are doing it to me
[41:01.680 --> 41:06.760]  forgive them they know not what they do and then it levels I hate them it levels
[41:06.760 --> 41:13.120]  I'm disgusted by what's in their eyes that they will never reach true humanity
[41:13.120 --> 41:19.760]  that they are damned off from us that are good I'm as dirty rags but I know I'm
[41:19.760 --> 41:24.600]  as dirty rags and I can see what's good I know it's good I choose that my heart
[41:24.600 --> 41:28.640]  wants to be good I reach for it and within that is the secret of the
[41:28.640 --> 41:33.520]  universe the reaching towards the goodness the reaching towards the honor
[41:33.520 --> 41:37.160]  the reaching towards the courage
[41:41.960 --> 41:49.240]  and so people think that they serve the system by only caring about themselves
[41:49.240 --> 41:55.760]  you basically end up destroying yourself and look at Kim Jong-il you know these
[41:55.760 --> 41:59.480]  guys always try to keep their dictatorship in place so their edifice
[41:59.480 --> 42:04.560]  can be worshipped so that their memory can be worshipped by a bunch of slaves
[42:04.560 --> 42:10.120]  who know full well that their country's a hellhole how empty is that true
[42:10.120 --> 42:17.160]  fulfillment is to have your progeny 20 generations away incredibly enlightened
[42:17.160 --> 42:21.720]  and more advanced than you were and to have your blood in their veins and to
[42:21.720 --> 42:27.120]  have that connection towards the future making it better just as we have to our
[42:27.120 --> 42:31.680]  ancestors whose names we don't even know who understood these truths and
[42:31.680 --> 42:36.280]  struggled so that we could be where we are today
[42:39.760 --> 42:45.040]  but you are going to die you are going if you're 25 years old it is going to be
[42:45.040 --> 42:48.520]  in the twinkle of an eye the blinking of an eye you're going to be on a
[42:48.520 --> 42:53.560]  respirator and the blinking of an eye a car is going to run that red light and
[42:53.560 --> 42:56.680]  t-bone you and smash you in there and you're going to die in three minutes
[42:56.680 --> 43:02.560]  bleeding to death some of you listening right now will be dead in a week this
[43:02.560 --> 43:08.920]  isn't put your hand to the TV God's telling me this this is statistics some
[43:08.920 --> 43:12.760]  of you listening to me right now are going to have a heart attack in the
[43:12.760 --> 43:16.880]  next month and die some of you are going to have a child that's going to die a
[43:16.880 --> 43:21.920]  mother a father that's going to die some of you are going to have family
[43:21.920 --> 43:25.120]  members that die this week
[43:27.240 --> 43:36.600]  but you only find the shadow of enlightenment by not being afraid the
[43:36.600 --> 43:40.720]  edge of enlightenment you could only glimpse it for a moment but it is
[43:40.720 --> 43:47.200]  transcendent in the reaching for it deciding good from evil recognizing the
[43:47.200 --> 43:52.120]  difference and saying I choose life I choose God I choose honor I choose
[43:52.120 --> 43:59.280]  strength I choose beauty I choose creation and I am willing to die for it
[43:59.280 --> 44:04.840]  and that's when the universe says that's when God says you are with life and
[44:04.840 --> 44:13.560]  forever you are beyond their grasp and those of you that serve darkness I
[44:13.560 --> 44:22.600]  understand you're spiritually blind I understand that you cannot be reached
[44:22.600 --> 44:29.240]  some of you cannot be reached you have so turned yourself over to darkness that
[44:29.240 --> 44:35.360]  you will never be reached and that is a truly sad thing and deep down at a
[44:35.360 --> 44:39.760]  spiritual level you know that you you you you're not really conscious of why
[44:39.760 --> 44:44.680]  you enjoy hurting beauty why you enjoy hurting innocence why beauty and
[44:44.680 --> 44:48.800]  innocence and strength is so ugly and frightening to you it's because you know
[44:48.800 --> 44:55.760]  you're not part of it and so you want to destroy it you cannot destroy it you
[44:55.760 --> 45:00.480]  could destroy this planet you have not destroyed life you can deface God's
[45:00.480 --> 45:06.120]  creation and engage in a trillion abominations of genetic engineering and
[45:06.120 --> 45:12.440]  it will not stand and I know that I know that as sure as gravity pulls me to
[45:12.440 --> 45:18.200]  this planet I know it as sure as I was born and I'm gonna die I know it 100%
[45:18.200 --> 45:33.040]  completely in my gut right here we've won the good guys win realize that but
[45:33.040 --> 45:39.160]  understand if you don't have a total drive and it's more than an obsession a
[45:39.160 --> 45:50.120]  a a a a filling up with a desire to defend innocence and with a desire to be
[45:50.120 --> 46:06.080]  good then you do not have a connection to creation and it is only through the
[46:06.080 --> 46:16.960]  connection to life and the creator of life that any of us have a future and it
[46:16.960 --> 46:20.440]  is a decision some of you that can still make the decision you have to make the
[46:20.440 --> 46:23.720]  decision you have to decide whether you serve life or you serve death there's
[46:23.720 --> 46:29.720]  only two two ways and if you knew history and had discernment why would you
[46:29.720 --> 46:40.000]  want to serve death and romanticize it why would you want to join with it
[46:40.000 --> 46:46.160]  because at a deep down level you're scared of it many of you and you think
[46:46.160 --> 46:51.360]  that if you embrace it that you can become it why would you want to become
[46:51.360 --> 47:01.200]  death death is only a tiny reflection of the larger creation it's only a dead
[47:01.200 --> 47:10.560]  zone a dead space a emptiness I choose the creation and what created it I
[47:10.560 --> 47:16.680]  choose all the limitless possibilities I choose the adventure but if you do not
[47:16.680 --> 47:24.560]  have a compulsion to resist evil if you have a compulsion that there is no good
[47:24.560 --> 47:31.720]  or evil that is the world and the God of this world blocking that transmission
[47:31.720 --> 47:38.640]  because if you were in the light of the Creator you could not do anything else
[47:38.640 --> 47:44.600]  but seek after life and decency and honor but if you're damned if you're
[47:44.600 --> 47:51.960]  blocked damned off like a river like a lake then you can't understand me it's
[47:51.960 --> 47:58.280]  all just gibberish talk and I understand that but for all of you Christians who
[47:58.280 --> 48:01.320]  say you're Christians and other religious people and people of faith and
[48:01.320 --> 48:09.360]  people that have a connection to God if you do not have a drive to go out and
[48:09.360 --> 48:17.400]  face down evil then you better get your house in order I'll tell you that right
[48:17.400 --> 48:20.680]  now because you just think you're gonna go to church and play patty cake and
[48:20.680 --> 48:25.040]  feel all good about what's happening in the world and go oh praise the Lord the
[48:25.040 --> 48:29.200]  end of the world's coming things are so bad that means I just sit here in my
[48:29.200 --> 48:34.520]  house and do nothing if you're not willing to go out and be laughed at by
[48:34.520 --> 48:38.000]  your neighbors if you're not willing to go out and warn people if you're not
[48:38.000 --> 48:42.320]  willing it's not even willing if you aren't like a drag racer running down
[48:42.320 --> 48:45.680]  the road to warn people you shouldn't even be a something where you're
[48:45.680 --> 48:50.960]  compelled you should want to be warning people if you don't have that drive in
[48:50.960 --> 49:01.800]  you then like I said you I would do some meditating on it because this is how
[49:01.800 --> 49:06.160]  tyranny works this is how corruption works this is how wickedness works what's
[49:06.160 --> 49:10.440]  wickedness people say there's no good or evil that's the number one line grabbing
[49:10.440 --> 49:14.080]  a two-year-old child and taking them and torturing them for a couple weeks doing
[49:14.080 --> 49:20.720]  horrible things to him is that evil you bet it is what the Aztecs did was that
[49:20.720 --> 49:26.480]  evil what the Nazis did under Hitler was that evil yes you know evil picking a
[49:26.480 --> 49:37.160]  puppy dog up and electrocuting it for fun that's that's evil and they try to
[49:37.160 --> 49:42.760]  train us that there's no good or evil so that we're rudderless so they can
[49:42.760 --> 49:49.600]  program our quote values where the system can snap its finger with some fake
[49:49.600 --> 49:53.160]  value they're trying to instill to submit to them and we all grovel and get all
[49:53.160 --> 49:57.520]  concerned political correctness but then basic human values notice they're all
[49:57.520 --> 50:03.280]  under assault and it's all made to weaken you evil is weak that's why it
[50:03.280 --> 50:07.560]  always tries to build big armored fortresses and systems of power and
[50:07.560 --> 50:16.400]  and and temporal destruction because the spirit of evil is a legless jellyfish
[50:16.400 --> 50:28.960]  leaving a trail of rotten scruffulous stench but in its evil it has built
[50:28.960 --> 50:35.720]  giant palaces of destructive force to wage war against us who are these
[50:35.720 --> 50:41.480]  incredible biomechanical creations who have limitless potential made in the
[50:41.480 --> 50:45.040]  image of a creator I don't like to preach it just comes out and I just did
[50:45.040 --> 50:49.120]  it I'm gonna come back I'm gonna hit Ron Paul surging into the lead more on
[50:49.120 --> 50:53.720]  North Korea more on incredible police-state power grabs in your calls
[50:53.720 --> 50:59.160]  at 800-259-9231
[51:02.800 --> 51:06.960]  folks have you lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the
[51:06.960 --> 51:10.800]  lights back on if so this is going to be the most important message you'll ever
[51:10.800 --> 51:14.600]  hear because there's never been a better time to get ready for the winner power
[51:14.600 --> 51:19.520]  outages ahead here's why solar power generators are now available from our
[51:19.520 --> 51:23.720]  friends at solutions from science one of our oldest sponsors their emergency
[51:23.720 --> 51:27.400]  backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most

[51:36.120 --> 51:40.600]  running quietly in your own own whether it's ice storms brownouts or blackouts

[54:07.960 --> 54:12.800]  front row seat to the group of technocrats who believe they're gonna
[54:12.800 --> 54:18.280]  become God through eugenics and a new species and the rest of us are gonna be
[54:18.280 --> 54:24.040]  killed people that think they're gonna become gods but first they want to kill
[54:24.040 --> 54:32.040]  the majority of us I think I heard that story before but of course all they
[54:32.040 --> 54:36.080]  really do is dumb down people and increase diseases and wreck life and
[54:36.080 --> 54:40.280]  launch giant wars everywhere because the spirit that drives them is one of death
[54:40.280 --> 54:44.200]  and destruction even if you don't believe it's a transient spirit or
[54:44.200 --> 54:49.280]  transcendent it's the it's the spirit of the age that the the spirit that
[54:49.280 --> 54:52.760]  manifests through evil groups like I want to finish up for you into Ron Paul
[54:52.760 --> 54:59.200]  and your calls with the rest of this video now again radio listeners can go
[54:59.200 --> 55:05.560]  to info wars.com and prisonplanet.com and read the article about it but this
[55:05.560 --> 55:09.920]  this is North Koreans being marched in as a state-run TV but if you look back
[55:09.920 --> 55:15.080]  on the distance you see them like in revenge of the body snatchers the poor
[55:15.080 --> 55:22.280]  people in North Korea in groups I guess in the phalanx in square groups like in
[55:22.280 --> 55:27.640]  the military marching in their little black citizen uniforms everybody
[55:27.640 --> 55:31.240]  dresses the same because the control freaks like it that way they like the
[55:31.240 --> 55:37.720]  geometric shapes and people you know doing acrobats all day perfectly for
[55:37.720 --> 55:43.520]  Kim Jong-il or you are dead oh yeah you make a mistake you're dead this is what
[55:43.520 --> 55:48.080]  government manifest every time when you let it go to extremes because there will
[55:48.080 --> 55:52.440]  always be some super extreme corrupt person that gets in control who replaces
[55:52.440 --> 55:56.440]  the person that wasn't as extreme you either have liberty or you have extreme
[55:56.440 --> 56:00.200]  tyranny and it's always going one direction or the other and it tends to
[56:00.200 --> 56:05.800]  pull towards tyranny I know I keep talking about this but we're going down
[56:05.800 --> 56:10.040]  the path North Korea is on but jaren go back to the video here you could see
[56:10.040 --> 56:15.600]  video of the groups marching up praying and worshiping the communist mass
[56:15.600 --> 56:23.720]  murder owners a giant job Stockholm syndrome of course it is fake crying so
[56:23.720 --> 56:33.960]  it's not complete Stockholm syndrome this pleasure palace you can't have you
[56:33.960 --> 56:37.040]  can't kidnap people anymore from other countries to rape them oh it's terrible
[56:37.040 --> 56:43.640]  he's so rowy a little degenerate guy in a jumpsuit and then it shows the groups
[56:43.640 --> 56:47.920]  marching in in the background here in a moment we'll pause it
[56:47.920 --> 56:51.280]  okay we'll back it up to where it shows that because I'm gonna pause it and show
[56:51.280 --> 56:54.680]  people if you look way back in the distance you see them marching in in
[56:54.680 --> 56:59.600]  big squares yeah there it is if you look back in the distance you see the the
[56:59.600 --> 57:03.000]  the groups all perfectly lined up of course there they are up front lined up
[57:03.000 --> 57:07.480]  you see the groups marching in the citizen corps these are the blessed
[57:07.480 --> 57:11.720]  people that get to have electricity a few hours a day and maybe two changes of
[57:11.720 --> 57:17.040]  clothes a month and get to work you know only 16 hours a day in slave factories
[57:17.040 --> 57:21.440]  they're the outer party the the inner party does have even better medical
[57:21.440 --> 57:25.040]  systems than we have here in the US and sex slaves and everything else and
[57:25.040 --> 57:28.160]  giant entertainment facilities but that's that's less than 1% of the
[57:28.160 --> 57:31.920]  population you have the outer party what are they like six seven percent of
[57:31.920 --> 57:37.320]  the population and the others North Korea takes children at birth has doctors
[57:37.320 --> 57:41.720]  check men and women who live in stalls and then they procreate this is the
[57:41.720 --> 57:45.680]  communist model and take the children like you take eggs from a hen and then
[57:45.680 --> 57:49.040]  that they're sent to another part of the country so that the family is the
[57:49.040 --> 57:53.400]  enemy oh and I have the textbooks they use at major universities I've shown
[57:53.400 --> 57:57.360]  them on air where it says the family belongs to an archaic age and must be
[57:57.360 --> 58:02.240]  eradicated and the family is a disease I just search the term top government
[58:02.240 --> 58:09.480]  psychologist as a family is a disease yes yes no you are a disease of
[58:09.480 --> 58:16.360]  parasites who create systems against those of us that want to be free you
[58:16.360 --> 58:23.920]  are the enemy of everything wholesome and good and you produce misery and pain
[58:23.920 --> 58:29.680]  and suffering which is what you like you like it you produce starving people with
[58:29.680 --> 58:34.000]  control freaks burning with hatred in their eyes in uniforms with machine
[58:34.000 --> 58:40.760]  guns beating people stomping on a face forever that's what you produce scum

[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:10.680]  in some positive news as well out of china right now let's talk to brad in
[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:16.680]  idaho you're on the air hey alex um you know there's one important thing that
[01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:21.680]  i wanted to say that seems to be a problem with us here in america and
[01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:26.680]  that's this idea which i'm glad you don't go along with it that we live in the
[01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:32.680]  end times and it just causes good people to do nothing yeah they say well it's
[01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:36.680]  the end of the world and in for secular folks they got 2012 they're like well
[01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:40.680]  i'm not religious but the mayans oh yes oh well that was religious it's the
[01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:44.680]  end of the world and so they're playing on that and that's why they injected
[01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:47.680]  into the society that it's the end of the world and then they have mainstream
[01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:51.680]  media saying that i say it's the end of the world and i have people on the
[01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:56.680]  street going is it the end of the world in 2012 because of movies with the
[01:01:56.680 --> 01:02:00.680]  conspiracy theory talk show host in like eight movies i've seen in the last few
[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:03.680]  years it's you know it's the alex jones character believes the end of the
[01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:07.680]  world's coming so even though i never believe that they they will attribute
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:12.680]  it to me see that's how mind control works that thing is when you go to church
[01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:16.680]  you hear it from the pulpit all the time and and i go to church regularly and go
[01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:20.680]  to men's bible studies and whatnot and i bring up these these evil things that
[01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:23.680]  are going on and they don't want to hear it because we're living in the end times
[01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:27.680]  and the point i just want to make is like even great guys like lindsay williams
[01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:32.680]  they say this kind of stuff but let let just exodus chapter twenty it says that
[01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:37.680]  god shows mercy to thousands of generations about about verse five
[01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:42.680]  well one thousand generations if you figure twenty years per generation
[01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:47.680]  that's twenty thousand years so all this speculation that we're living in
[01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:52.680]  times is totally speculation even though undoubtedly a lot of what's in the
[01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:57.680]  revelation and stuff is beginning but always churches speed up the timetable
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:01.680]  it's always the end of the world and you know christ said no one knows the time
[01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:05.680]  or day and let them not deceive you and pull up the actual quote that's a
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:08.680]  paraphrase but again here's the deceivers just constantly it's the end of the
[01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:10.680]  world it's the end of the world it's the end of the world it's the end of the
[01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:15.680]  world and again let's say it was god's not going to want to i don't want to
[01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:19.680]  get off into preaching here okay the point is morally you have a responsibility
[01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:24.680]  to save a child who's about to be run over even of the world's ending in a
[01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:29.680]  year i mean a lot of this is what i've seen i don't want to criticize grips but
[01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:33.680]  over in india well you're going to get reincarnated anyway so who cares if a kid gets run over
[01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:36.680]  or who cares if there's homeless people dying on the street or you know that's
[01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:41.680]  their karma and really the globalist the last hundred and twenty years put this
[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:45.680]  idea out it was never in christianities it was never taught that it's the end of
[01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:50.680]  the world next week because it's it's like a karma thing well god's coming so
[01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:54.680]  that's almost like karmic like that's just the way it is again it's a total
[01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:59.680]  self-fulfilling prophecy mind game hey it's all over anyways hey they were going
[01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:03.680]  to bulldoze this house tomorrow who cares if it burns down today and then the
[01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:10.680]  house is burned down and then it never gets bulldozed you see what i'm saying
[01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:15.680]  yes so i mean it's a total but listen those listen the people have always
[01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:20.680]  lived in denial and so those guys are scared of cops they're scared of their
[01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:24.680]  wife they're scared of somebody not thinking their suit looks right so they
[01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:28.680]  they want to just sit there with each other and feel real good and and let's
[01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:34.680]  pray and you know and they're the people christ pointed at the Pharisees and said
[01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:38.680]  look at them but they're praying in public you need to pray privately those are
[01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:44.680]  the people who want to be all up there on such a good girl oh my goodness did
[01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:49.680]  you hear he played some of that fast you know rock and roll music hit of the

[01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:23.680]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:27.680]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:31.680]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:34.680]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related

[01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:23.680]  all right my friends we are back live we are now into the second hour I want to
[01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:28.680]  go to your phone calls right now and then I'm going to get to welcome to the
[01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:34.680]  united states of america welcome to the united police states of america
[01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:39.680]  sponsored by twitter twitter is now censoring even mainline journalist
[01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:44.680]  and saying we're not going to allow you to have your free speech also in
[01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:48.680]  china the people are fighting back and taking back towns from the incredibly
[01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:53.680]  corrupt local party officials that run around acting like god unfortunately
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:57.680]  they're totally buffaloed in north korea because they've completely destroyed
[01:08:57.680 --> 01:09:00.680]  the family and everything else see tyrants figure out that if you can raise
[01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:05.680]  humans like barn animals and and keep a subgroup that can't even read or write
[01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:09.680]  in in there that you pretty much got them you got to go to the slavery model
[01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:15.680]  though and that's what that's what the globalist model takes you to the
[01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:19.680]  post-industrial shutdown total control grid while they fly around above us in
[01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:24.680]  lear jets and predator drones and surveillance blimps that's the model
[01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:27.680]  they're building so i'm going to get to that in a really creepy article out of
[01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:32.680]  fox news exclusive epa ponders expanding regulatory power in name of
[01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:35.680]  sustainable development they got the documents and they say they're just
[01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:39.680]  going to not even try carbon taxing anymore they're going to do that too
[01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:42.680]  but that's not me their main push it's just going to be everything they will
[01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:46.680]  decide if you can have a business a job anything and that's always been the
[01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:53.680]  plan so we're going to be breaking that down also again
[01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:58.680]  ron paul is now the clear front runner again rich has imploded to third place
[01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:03.680]  with 14 points at a new big scientific poll that's out we're going to be
[01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:08.680]  going over that and a lot more on the economy front but let's go to your
[01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:14.680]  calls right now let's go ahead and speak with a zekiel no a net's up first
[01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:20.680]  and then a zekiel a net in west virginia you're on the air alex i haven't spoken
[01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:25.680]  to you in a long time but i want you to know the american people and those
[01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:30.680]  outside america owe you a very great debt of gratitude for all that you are
[01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:37.680]  doing to inform and give direction as to how to overcome this terrible
[01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:43.680]  conspiracy now i've been into this research for 60 years i started when
[01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:51.680]  i was a child and i have a picture that you don't quite seem to manifest
[01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:55.680]  over the year and so there's just one area where you seem to be somewhat
[01:10:55.680 --> 01:11:02.680]  myopic so just give me a minute to go over some statistics all right it's
[01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:10.680]  regarding the the hitler regime now when i'm speaking from the 1934 and the
[01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:17.680]  1945 world almanac and the book of facts the jewish population worldwide by
[01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:23.680]  religious beliefs and that's according to the american jewish committee and
[01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:28.680]  the jewish statistical bureau of the synagogue council of america and the
[01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:34.680]  director was hs lynn where are you going with this coming up yeah this is what
[01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:40.680]  i'm going to say in 1934 the almanac said that when hitler took power there
[01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:48.680]  were 15,630,000 jews worldwide by religious beliefs when he left power
[01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:57.680]  in 1945 there weren't less jews there were 58,000 plus more okay now i'll
[01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:02.680]  send you those statistics because they're from they're from jewish sources
[01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:07.680]  okay ma'am are you saying the hitler didn't kill any jews or anybody or what
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:15.680]  i'm saying i'm saying that there are a hitler's issue was race he found that
[01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:21.680]  behind communism were the globalists and the globalists were from talmudic
[01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:32.680]  capitalism and their idea was to eliminate all the races except themselves and to have a
[01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:39.680]  in other words what you're seeing in north korea is not only out of the protocols
[01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:44.680]  but numerous other kinds of documents i'm saying hold on ma'am are you saying
[01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:49.680]  every you're saying north because i'm listening to what you're saying and trying
[01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:54.680]  but you're saying north korea is it is a jewish thing no i'm saying the
[01:12:54.680 --> 01:13:00.680]  principles are the same you have a network of these globalists all over the
[01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:05.680]  world they claim it and their writings and that's why i'm surprised you haven't
[01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:10.680]  you haven't seen these writings i listen listen listen i hear what you're saying
[01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:16.680]  and i appreciate your call but all i know is that clearly there were groups of
[01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:23.680]  socialist Zionist who wanted to establish socialism worldwide and i get that
[01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:29.680]  there are different camps in every group and i certainly understand that there
[01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:33.680]  but i mean there have been all sorts of tyrannies throughout history and there were
[01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:39.680]  tyrannies in china before you know a jewish person ever stepped foot there
[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:47.680]  the british empire running around so over the years i tend to try to stay out of
[01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:52.680]  saying catholics run it all or masons run it all or jews run it all or
[01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:57.680]  mormons run it all your reptoids run it all just because people tend to always
[01:13:57.680 --> 01:14:01.680]  get into this stuff i mean half the internet is just battling saying it's
[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:04.680]  this group it's that group and there are groups that say that i work for every
[01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:09.680]  group the jews the reptoids the catholics the whatever i work for liberty and
[01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:14.680]  freedom and i understand there's groups in every group that want world
[01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:17.680]  government it's like pinky in the brain what are we gonna do today something we
[01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:21.680]  do every day try to take over the world i mean it's like the rock and roll song
[01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:26.680]  everybody wants to rule the world i i actually don't sounds like a nightmare
[01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:29.680]  it's like these these polygamous that have like ten wives that just sounds
[01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:34.680]  horrible i mean one wife's great but i mean you know there's a lot of
[01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:37.680]  responsibilities and things and does something goes on i couldn't imagine
[01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:40.680]  ten women fighting with each other and all the stuff that would come out of
[01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:44.680]  them and i just sounds like hell on earth but i want to be left alone and
[01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:47.680]  see good people never want power and that's why evil always runs things
[01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:52.680]  because we won't get in place get in charge to stop them and the founders
[01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:58.680]  tried to do it they weren't perfect but there is a total here's what i'm
[01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:03.680]  saying i judge trees by their fruits okay and all i know is is that the
[01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:08.680]  anti-jewish crowd always starts out the same i'm not anti-jewish i'm anti
[01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:14.680]  Zionist and then it turns into actually Jews are the devil we need to get
[01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:18.680]  rid of them and Hitler didn't kill anybody but you know what too bad he
[01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:21.680]  didn't kill them all and i can't tell you how many times i've seen that read
[01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:26.680]  that been told that been threatened with that we're gonna kill you you Jew and
[01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:30.680]  meanwhile i have the ADL attacking me saying i'm basically you know some
[01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:34.680]  kind of Hitler or something and it's it's just all these groups act the same
[01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:39.680]  it's all tribalism and Israel engages a lot of different brands of tribalism
[01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:42.680]  i got an article here where they make the women sit on the back of the buses
[01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:47.680]  even though they passed a law last year saying they can't and you know if
[01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:51.680]  you're in Israel you can't if you're Jewish you get arrested if you marry
[01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:55.680]  somebody who isn't Jewish i mean that's like apartheid or something but if you
[01:15:55.680 --> 01:15:59.680]  say that you get attacked i mean i'm against all of that i i i mean especially
[01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:04.680]  if you've got some of the same liberal lobbies connected to Israel telling us
[01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:07.680]  here to give up all your farmland and let the government brainwash your kids
[01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:11.680]  here or you're a bigot but then but it's okay of Israel hands out machine guns
[01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:15.680]  to their whole population and arrest anybody that you marry someone who's
[01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:19.680]  Jewish but everybody else you know you better marry somebody outside your group
[01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:24.680]  i mean i mean i get it all okay but i mean this hypocrisy is everywhere
[01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:30.680]  but at the same time the fruits of the anti-Jewish groups
[01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:33.680]  i mean you sound like a nice lady you actually made some points i'll try to
[01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:37.680]  look into it i've seen some of what you're talking about but usually it's
[01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:42.680]  all right listen here listen here jew jones you're gonna get it and we know
[01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:46.680]  you get your orders from televieve and the and we got the documents your
[01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:50.680]  whole things owned by the brothmans or whatever i mean it's just like total
[01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:55.680]  insanity answer for answer for how you work for Israel and i'm just like okay i
[01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:59.680]  do then i mean it's not true but and answer for the fact that you're a
[01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:02.680]  reptoid we're gonna shoot you improve you're gonna turn into one on stage
[01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:06.680]  i'm just like these people are crazy or or i know you work for the Vatican
[01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:10.680]  and because they photoshopped my head on a catholic priest outfit i'm working
[01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:13.680]  for the Vatican that's not bad if you were Catholic i'm not getting into all
[01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:18.680]  these fights this is what diseases our country i'm for liberty and freedom
[01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:22.680]  and lower taxes and the family and the second amendment and national sovereignty
[01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:27.680]  okay and i'm not gonna get sidetracked often to all these groups and i have
[01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:35.680]  never let me see the worst it could be the catholic run at all crowd or the
[01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:41.680]  jew bashing crowd they're pretty much the same in their hatred for me i don't
[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:44.680]  know a lot of its operatives we've proven that but some of them are mainly
[01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:50.680]  just jealous or mentally ill or low grade morons and they just sit there and
[01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:57.680]  obsess and obsess and obsess and obsess and obsess and just make up all manner
[01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:01.680]  of stuff and then after they've passed around a lie they then say it's true so
[01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:05.680]  i have a lot of trouble in these investigations and things with different
[01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:09.680]  groups but particularly i'd say the dominant group is jews run at all
[01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:16.680]  because i see so much disinformation and that i know is not true about me
[01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:19.680]  when they have like clear operatives that dress up in like santa claus
[01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:23.680]  outfits and and and you know sit there and say that i'm jewish and stuff and
[01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:30.680]  it wouldn't be bad if i was but i'm not you know it's it's it's it's frustrating
[01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:34.680]  and it's a diversion and it's a distraction from real debate the real
[01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:39.680]  world real headway that's being made against tyranny and just to show you
[01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:42.680]  how this stuff leads nowhere they're going to throw they already are any
[01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:46.680]  scimitism at ron paul they're going to even though he's not even going there
[01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:50.680]  they're going to because he won't go there they hate it they're going to throw
[01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:54.680]  races towards black people because he doesn't go there they're going to throw
[01:18:54.680 --> 01:19:00.680]  the kitchen sink at him because this stuff leads nowhere i've read zionist
[01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:05.680]  stuff out of israel that's public where they say encourage anti-Semitism
[01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:10.680]  because it makes people come here work here and then basically that political
[01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:15.680]  class can then feed off those people it's the same everywhere china israel the
[01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:21.680]  us north korea mexico and so they love the outside threat it's a form of
[01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:28.680]  false flag and so they want to make it about all that i'm not going to do it i
[01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:34.680]  just want freedom it's really simple okay that's what i want and if you'll

[01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:42.680]  others they can't make heads or tails of the fact that then the adl's attacking
[01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:45.680]  me all day so they spend it and say oh well that's because they're trying to
[01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:49.680]  give him publicity oh yeah when they over the years have tried to call up radio

[01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:18.680]  I was a little boy
[01:24:18.680 --> 01:24:21.680]  I was a little boy
[01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:24.680]  I was a little boy
[01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:27.680]  I was a little boy
[01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:33.680]  I remember back in 1996 when Bill Clinton got caught shipping missile secrets
[01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:38.680]  through Laurel and Hughes to communist China so their missiles could hit the US
[01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:43.680]  with precision and instead of one ICBM being launched going up into space
[01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:47.680]  and orbit and coming back down you know firing them from northern China
[01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:51.680]  over the north poles the shortest distance into North America hitting
[01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:56.680]  Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, Dallas cities like that when it comes back
[01:24:56.680 --> 01:25:02.680]  into the atmosphere the nosecon pops off and say 10 dummy warheads shoot out
[01:25:02.680 --> 01:25:07.680]  to confuse anti-missile systems and 10 real warheads come down
[01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:11.680]  Bill Clinton and our government who's always ringing its hands
[01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:16.680]  oh my gosh what if Iran gets a nuke we're all dead it's horrible
[01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:21.680]  oh oh oh you know Iraq was going to have a nuke remember
[01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:24.680]  45 minutes from now they could blow up England remember that
[01:25:24.680 --> 01:25:27.680]  then they got anthrax trucks that they knew had been sold by the British
[01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:32.680]  and were for pumping up balloons surveillance balloons
[01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:37.680]  hot air balloons or not not hydrogen balloons they knew all that
[01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:43.680]  they knew it they lied they lied and now Iran is sitting over there
[01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:47.680]  and is not developing a nuclear weapon and if they did we're going to start nuclear war
[01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:51.680]  our government through AQCon laboratories helped transfer nukes to Pakistan
[01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:56.680]  why to shake up the world why did our criminal government help arm China
[01:25:56.680 --> 01:26:00.680]  help give them the nuke in the beginning and help give them the Merv technology
[01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:05.680]  over the years why why do the controllers the planet do this because
[01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:10.680]  they had a secret alliance against Russia the whole time the globalists
[01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:14.680]  made a deal with the Chinese when they put Mao say tongue in power
[01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:17.680]  and then if he didn't follow orders they kept the Russians right there
[01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:21.680]  which the big mega banks the Rothschilds and others were in control of
[01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:25.680]  oh yeah the Rothschilds are right up there at the head of it
[01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:29.680]  the fact is their evil corrupt family engaged in carbon taxes
[01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:32.680]  new world order everything else but I'm not going to attack them
[01:26:32.680 --> 01:26:37.680]  because they happen to be Jewish by the way I'm going to attack them for their deeds
[01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:40.680]  just like when I attack Kim Jong-il it's not because he's a Korean
[01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:45.680]  it's because he's an evil person I want to make it about the character of deeds
[01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:49.680]  so then we can all stand against corruption regardless of what color somebody's skin is
[01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:53.680]  but getting back to Clinton as I went off into a rant about it
[01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:57.680]  it was all over CNN all over the Washington Post you'll remember at the time
[01:26:57.680 --> 01:27:01.680]  if you were a news junkie like I was it was every week
[01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:07.680]  our criticisms of China and trade deals racist
[01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:10.680]  is it really about hating Asians
[01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:15.680]  or Republicans that don't want to have new trade deals with China which disadvantages
[01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:19.680]  are they racist
[01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:23.680]  is all this criticism of Clinton and missiles secrets ICBM secrets
[01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:26.680]  really because they're Asian
[01:27:26.680 --> 01:27:29.680]  is it racism against Chinese people
[01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:32.680]  this is how they sell it you see
[01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:35.680]  to make it that oh well I'm certainly not going to
[01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:38.680]  hey why are you giving the Panama Canal to China we built that
[01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:42.680]  it's part of globalist strategic takeover not for the Chinese people
[01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:46.680]  but for the corrupt elites over there who are elites absolutely love
[01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:48.680]  and made a deal with
[01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:51.680]  Shinkai check and the nationalists were kicked out
[01:27:51.680 --> 01:27:54.680]  that was always a theory it actually been in newspapers in the 50s
[01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:57.680]  49, 50, 51 and there'd be congressional hearings
[01:27:57.680 --> 01:28:00.680]  it always turns into a rumor because folks didn't go to the source documents
[01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:04.680]  now it's come back out in the news even the history channel admits it
[01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:09.680]  I saw some former CIA section chief 1947 to 51 from China
[01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:13.680]  on history channel almost fell out of my chair about 6, 7 years ago
[01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:16.680]  and he was up there look like he was you know on death doorstep
[01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:20.680]  but he was talking he's like actually we were there and didn't like Shinkai check
[01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:23.680]  so we gave him weapons that didn't work
[01:28:23.680 --> 01:28:26.680]  we had a secret program the public wouldn't support because he was communist
[01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:30.680]  to put Mao Zedong into power and we backed him all along
[01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:35.680]  and then it just just I mean it's on history channel
[01:28:35.680 --> 01:28:40.680]  Mao Zedong he killed 60 plus million our government says
[01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:42.680]  the Chinese government in their estimates
[01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:46.680]  look this up says 80 plus million
[01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:49.680]  60 on the low 80 on the high
[01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:52.680]  60 million plus dead people
[01:28:55.680 --> 01:28:57.680]  and I'm not supposed to talk about that
[01:28:57.680 --> 01:29:01.680]  I'm not supposed to say hey is it moral and it's everywhere
[01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:03.680]  some products you can't get if they're not made in China
[01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:07.680]  is it moral to do this with children working their fingers
[01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:11.680]  till they bleed in those factories you know make these companies charge
[01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:17.680]  pay a little more whatever they'd still be able to destroy the European and US markets
[01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:21.680]  to the globalist made a deal they go oh you've got you've got 800 million
[01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:24.680]  now it's a billion plus 200 million or so
[01:29:24.680 --> 01:29:28.680]  you've got a 800 million people that'll work to death for us
[01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:32.680]  we'll be able to have selective deals with you and shut down all our competition
[01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:36.680]  and that's what happened and now they're like how dare you be racist against the Chinese
[01:29:36.680 --> 01:29:39.680]  if you don't like suicide nets around their factories
[01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:41.680]  and want to be able to go to the bathroom every eight hours
[01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:44.680]  you people are racist against Asians
[01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:47.680]  because you don't like the slave factories in China
[01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:50.680]  children in firework factories
[01:29:50.680 --> 01:29:54.680]  are on the march the empire's on the run
[01:29:54.680 --> 01:30:20.680]  this man is made some outrageous predictions over the years
[01:30:20.680 --> 01:30:24.680]  he's usually right you see he predicted the collapse of GM
[01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:28.680]  Panny Mae, Freddie Mac and America's biggest mall owner General Growth Properties
[01:30:28.680 --> 01:30:31.680]  in fact Barron's called his work a dire prophecy
[01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:34.680]  recently he created a video which you can watch online for free
[01:30:34.680 --> 01:30:37.680]  detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet
[01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:39.680]  and it's a real eye-opener
[01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:43.680]  I can't stress this enough you should at least watch this free video online today
[01:30:43.680 --> 01:30:47.680]  he explains everything you need to know including simple steps you can take to protect yourself
[01:30:47.680 --> 01:30:51.680]  you can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com

[01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:05.680]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:08.680]  this is our last chance to not relive history
[01:32:08.680 --> 01:32:10.680]  as we're finishing off this agenda
[01:32:10.680 --> 01:32:13.680]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[01:32:13.680 --> 01:32:17.680]  I've turned the members influence on our president in Congress
[01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:19.680]  and they really are calling the shots
[01:32:19.680 --> 01:32:24.680]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention
[01:32:24.680 --> 01:32:28.680]  full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[01:32:28.680 --> 01:32:32.680]  the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:35.680]  and on its ashes constructing world government
[01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:37.680]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, their arsonists
[01:32:37.680 --> 01:32:39.680]  they're asking for more matches
[01:32:39.680 --> 01:32:41.680]  and the Congress is saying who do we make the check out to
[01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:43.680]  today seems like nobody does care
[01:32:43.680 --> 01:32:45.680]  and right now in Washington DC
[01:32:45.680 --> 01:32:48.680]  we have seen a fall of the Republic
[01:32:48.680 --> 01:32:53.680]  get your copy of full of the Republic on DVD at www.InfoWars.com
[01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:55.680]  we're watching online right now
[01:32:55.680 --> 01:33:23.680]  in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:25.680]  we are back live
[01:33:25.680 --> 01:33:28.680]  and I want to kind of hurry through your phone calls now
[01:33:28.680 --> 01:33:30.680]  because I do need to get to the Ron Paul news
[01:33:30.680 --> 01:33:32.680]  he is the leader, not just in Iowa
[01:33:32.680 --> 01:33:34.680]  but the numbers are coming in in other states
[01:33:34.680 --> 01:33:36.680]  and the attack is on later in the next hour
[01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:38.680]  I'll get into how they're going to attack him
[01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:40.680]  but I want to hit this news first
[01:33:40.680 --> 01:33:44.680]  then get into really dangerous UN takeover
[01:33:44.680 --> 01:33:46.680]  of our country through the EPA
[01:33:46.680 --> 01:33:48.680]  Fox News is reporting on this
[01:33:48.680 --> 01:33:50.680]  and I've read over the treaty
[01:33:50.680 --> 01:33:52.680]  this is exactly what it does
[01:33:52.680 --> 01:33:55.680]  the EPA says they're implementing it even if we don't
[01:33:55.680 --> 01:33:57.680]  because they're the bureaucracy
[01:33:57.680 --> 01:34:01.680]  and Obama is launching wars without Congress
[01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:04.680]  I mean the executive in the bureaucracy
[01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:06.680]  is completely out of control
[01:34:06.680 --> 01:34:08.680]  so that is coming up
[01:34:08.680 --> 01:34:10.680]  and they say they're pondering it folks
[01:34:10.680 --> 01:34:13.680]  if they say pondering that means it's already going into place
[01:34:13.680 --> 01:34:15.680]  they're already shutting down buildings being built in Austin
[01:34:15.680 --> 01:34:17.680]  and calling it sustainable
[01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:20.680]  because they're not the little inside mafia
[01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:22.680]  oh if your tree is bigger than 10 inches around
[01:34:22.680 --> 01:34:24.680]  you can't build a 20 story skyscraper
[01:34:24.680 --> 01:34:26.680]  that really would be sustainable
[01:34:26.680 --> 01:34:28.680]  compact living as if we don't have any room
[01:34:28.680 --> 01:34:30.680]  but even in their paradigm
[01:34:30.680 --> 01:34:32.680]  but if you're an insider you get the waiver
[01:34:32.680 --> 01:34:35.680]  let's go to Ezekiel in Kentucky
[01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:38.680]  Ezekiel you're on the air
[01:34:38.680 --> 01:34:41.680]  hey Alex look I made the mistake
[01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:44.680]  you know 10 years ago I was even awake then
[01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:47.680]  and lying listed in the Marine Corps
[01:34:47.680 --> 01:34:51.680]  and why it was even initiated into the Masonic Order
[01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:53.680]  I had a fantasy or kind of a notion
[01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:55.680]  that I would go inside the machine
[01:34:55.680 --> 01:34:57.680]  and I'm going to change from the inside out
[01:34:57.680 --> 01:34:59.680]  I'll be the loose cog inside the engine
[01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:01.680]  and I just want this to be a warning
[01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:03.680]  to other people out there that
[01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:05.680]  you know I found out that although that's not impossible
[01:35:05.680 --> 01:35:07.680]  it's not usually what happens
[01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:09.680]  what usually happens is like
[01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:11.680]  what happened to me is the machine will shred you to bits
[01:35:11.680 --> 01:35:14.680]  and spits you out into the trash
[01:35:14.680 --> 01:35:16.680]  if you think you can change from the inside
[01:35:16.680 --> 01:35:19.680]  you'll find out and it's what happened to me
[01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:22.680]  but concerning the esoteric industrial complex
[01:35:22.680 --> 01:35:24.680]  it's Nick Mason
[01:35:24.680 --> 01:35:26.680]  it's the best brotherhood and illumination
[01:35:26.680 --> 01:35:28.680]  that money can buy Alex
[01:35:28.680 --> 01:35:30.680]  the Mason's are the bottom of the barrel
[01:35:30.680 --> 01:35:32.680]  but they offer gateways to the top
[01:35:32.680 --> 01:35:34.680]  and I'm not here to demonize Freemasons
[01:35:34.680 --> 01:35:36.680]  because there's corruption
[01:35:36.680 --> 01:35:38.680]  and evil in every institution
[01:35:38.680 --> 01:35:40.680]  and most the Lodges are genuine well-meaning people
[01:35:40.680 --> 01:35:43.680]  to do a lot of help and charity in their community
[01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:46.680]  but inside there's a dark force behind the secret passages
[01:35:46.680 --> 01:35:48.680]  behind the mirrors
[01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:50.680]  down here in Kentucky there are some Lodges
[01:35:50.680 --> 01:35:52.680]  that are completely racist and openly barred blacks
[01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:54.680]  from joining ever and that's the main
[01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:57.680]  that's what really got me stopped going
[01:35:57.680 --> 01:35:59.680]  and then you know there's other Lodges
[01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:01.680]  that there's only police are members of
[01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:04.680]  and they've been known to manufacture meth
[01:36:04.680 --> 01:36:06.680]  and what happened to me
[01:36:06.680 --> 01:36:08.680]  it ended up getting in trouble
[01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:10.680]  you know it was a victim of
[01:36:10.680 --> 01:36:12.680]  it sounds crazy but I was a victim
[01:36:12.680 --> 01:36:14.680]  of a psychological warfare
[01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:16.680]  and psychic attack if you will
[01:36:16.680 --> 01:36:18.680]  and I ended up going to jail
[01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:20.680]  I was in prison for a year
[01:36:20.680 --> 01:36:22.680]  and you find inside that
[01:36:22.680 --> 01:36:24.680]  when you're inside that angle
[01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:26.680]  there's so much more you see that people would never know
[01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:28.680]  and it's just unbelievable
[01:36:28.680 --> 01:36:30.680]  but I mean there's a multitude of people
[01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:32.680]  who join these groups
[01:36:32.680 --> 01:36:34.680]  people who are like me who simply wanted to search
[01:36:34.680 --> 01:36:36.680]  for the truth and knowledge
[01:36:36.680 --> 01:36:38.680]  and there's loners looking for friendship
[01:36:38.680 --> 01:36:40.680]  but the worst kind
[01:36:40.680 --> 01:36:42.680]  the top the fastest
[01:36:42.680 --> 01:36:44.680]  these are those who want to join
[01:36:44.680 --> 01:36:46.680]  when it's all about money or power to them
[01:36:46.680 --> 01:36:48.680]  No you're right Ezekiel
[01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:50.680]  God bless you it was good to hear from you
[01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:52.680]  look
[01:36:52.680 --> 01:36:55.680]  what he said is the truth
[01:36:55.680 --> 01:36:57.680]  from my research
[01:36:57.680 --> 01:37:00.680]  prisons are America's real
[01:37:00.680 --> 01:37:02.680]  colleges
[01:37:02.680 --> 01:37:04.680]  it's where you learn
[01:37:04.680 --> 01:37:06.680]  how to work in the system
[01:37:06.680 --> 01:37:08.680]  how to deal drugs inside the system
[01:37:08.680 --> 01:37:10.680]  and it's how you go to jail
[01:37:10.680 --> 01:37:12.680]  for some petty thing
[01:37:12.680 --> 01:37:14.680]  and you get out and can't get a regular job
[01:37:14.680 --> 01:37:16.680]  but you've been taught
[01:37:16.680 --> 01:37:18.680]  10 or 15 other scams
[01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:20.680]  and then you finally get caught a few years later
[01:37:20.680 --> 01:37:22.680]  a decade down the road
[01:37:22.680 --> 01:37:24.680]  now you're a hardened criminal
[01:37:24.680 --> 01:37:26.680]  you go back in and the cycle goes on
[01:37:26.680 --> 01:37:28.680]  over and over again and now
[01:37:28.680 --> 01:37:30.680]  such a large part of the population is criminal
[01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:32.680]  just proving the more jails you get
[01:37:32.680 --> 01:37:34.680]  the more criminals you have
[01:37:34.680 --> 01:37:36.680]  they're giant colleges for it
[01:37:36.680 --> 01:37:38.680]  there's too many piranhas
[01:37:38.680 --> 01:37:40.680]  in this lake
[01:37:40.680 --> 01:37:42.680]  let's throw a side of beef in every day
[01:37:42.680 --> 01:37:44.680]  to create twice as many
[01:37:44.680 --> 01:37:46.680]  and the system knows this
[01:37:46.680 --> 01:37:48.680]  and so now all over the country
[01:37:48.680 --> 01:37:50.680]  states and counties are creating laws
[01:37:50.680 --> 01:37:52.680]  where felons can be hired
[01:37:52.680 --> 01:37:54.680]  and you go into a city council
[01:37:54.680 --> 01:37:56.680]  or you go into a county commissioner court
[01:37:56.680 --> 01:37:58.680]  and there's just felons
[01:37:58.680 --> 01:38:00.680]  everywhere and they're there
[01:38:00.680 --> 01:38:02.680]  there are sheriff's departments
[01:38:02.680 --> 01:38:04.680]  where they get around this
[01:38:04.680 --> 01:38:06.680]  city
[01:38:06.680 --> 01:38:08.680]  I mean I've been pulled over
[01:38:08.680 --> 01:38:10.680]  I know what he's talking about in East Texas
[01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:12.680]  and the cop walks over and you're driving
[01:38:12.680 --> 01:38:14.680]  80 miles an hour on a 55
[01:38:14.680 --> 01:38:16.680]  and right there he's wearing short sleeves
[01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:18.680]  he's got big old swastikas
[01:38:18.680 --> 01:38:20.680]  and he's like oh
[01:38:20.680 --> 01:38:22.680]  especially back when I was a teenager
[01:38:22.680 --> 01:38:24.680]  I had blonde hair blue eyes he goes
[01:38:24.680 --> 01:38:26.680]  well howl Hitler you can go
[01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:28.680]  I didn't say howl Hitler back
[01:38:28.680 --> 01:38:30.680]  I'm not going to play along with stuff
[01:38:30.680 --> 01:38:32.680]  just so I get out of trouble
[01:38:32.680 --> 01:38:34.680]  we had beer we had a few beers
[01:38:34.680 --> 01:38:36.680]  I was like 16 driving back
[01:38:36.680 --> 01:38:38.680]  from the beach to Dallas
[01:38:38.680 --> 01:38:40.680]  pulls us over
[01:38:40.680 --> 01:38:42.680]  we had beer in the car
[01:38:42.680 --> 01:38:44.680]  he walks over we're just sitting there
[01:38:44.680 --> 01:38:46.680]  and I'm looking at his arms
[01:38:46.680 --> 01:38:48.680]  he's got swastika on the arms
[01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:50.680]  swastika on his forearm
[01:38:50.680 --> 01:38:52.680]  and I'm like what in the world
[01:38:52.680 --> 01:38:54.680]  what happens when that guy pulls black people over
[01:38:54.680 --> 01:38:56.680]  I mean what
[01:38:56.680 --> 01:38:58.680]  and it's the same thing for the Mexican mafia
[01:38:58.680 --> 01:39:00.680]  and people that are racist towards blacks and whites
[01:39:00.680 --> 01:39:02.680]  I mean what is that like
[01:39:02.680 --> 01:39:04.680]  I just
[01:39:04.680 --> 01:39:06.680]  it's tribalism and again the globalists
[01:39:06.680 --> 01:39:08.680]  sold the dominant culture here
[01:39:08.680 --> 01:39:10.680]  Christian mainline
[01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:12.680]  conservative a little racist
[01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:14.680]  but they sold that group
[01:39:14.680 --> 01:39:16.680]  on being hating themselves
[01:39:16.680 --> 01:39:18.680]  and everything else and they bought it believe me
[01:39:18.680 --> 01:39:20.680]  most white people are not racist they hate themselves
[01:39:20.680 --> 01:39:22.680]  worship any other group
[01:39:22.680 --> 01:39:24.680]  and oh hand my kids over
[01:39:24.680 --> 01:39:26.680]  put them on riddle and so I'm not racist
[01:39:26.680 --> 01:39:28.680]  prove I'm trendy I'll do it
[01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:30.680]  that's the world view they have
[01:39:30.680 --> 01:39:32.680]  and that's so they have no culture
[01:39:32.680 --> 01:39:34.680]  and no defense against the multicultural
[01:39:34.680 --> 01:39:36.680]  Ford Foundation going
[01:39:36.680 --> 01:39:38.680]  and liberation theology creating absolute
[01:39:38.680 --> 01:39:40.680]  tribalism racism in the other groups
[01:39:40.680 --> 01:39:42.680]  that way
[01:39:42.680 --> 01:39:44.680]  then they can be teamed up with the state
[01:39:44.680 --> 01:39:46.680]  against
[01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:48.680]  the group that was seen as dominant but you're going to see them shift
[01:39:48.680 --> 01:39:50.680]  out of that paradigm soon because
[01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:52.680]  why America doesn't exist it said
[01:39:52.680 --> 01:39:54.680]  there is no culture there's no black
[01:39:54.680 --> 01:39:56.680]  culture there is no white culture
[01:39:56.680 --> 01:39:58.680]  the black culture we have is not what the black culture was
[01:39:58.680 --> 01:40:00.680]  I've studied it 50 years ago
[01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:02.680]  in this country it's the most aberrant
[01:40:02.680 --> 01:40:04.680]  and MTV picks it up
[01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:06.680]  and shoots it out and it's a prison
[01:40:06.680 --> 01:40:08.680]  bling drug dealer destructive
[01:40:08.680 --> 01:40:10.680]  system the country culture
[01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:12.680]  the rural culture we've got
[01:40:12.680 --> 01:40:14.680]  is not the culture we had 50 years ago
[01:40:14.680 --> 01:40:16.680]  it is a artificial
[01:40:16.680 --> 01:40:18.680]  culture and they get icons
[01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:20.680]  up there it's not even about making the hundreds
[01:40:20.680 --> 01:40:22.680]  of millions a year per icon
[01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:24.680]  that's small chump change the globalist they print
[01:40:24.680 --> 01:40:26.680]  and issue the money it's about controlling
[01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:28.680]  the culture so they can tell
[01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:30.680]  you what's cool
[01:40:30.680 --> 01:40:32.680]  to where people can't help it they can't
[01:40:32.680 --> 01:40:34.680]  get into the real life soap opera of fighting
[01:40:34.680 --> 01:40:36.680]  tyranny the national defense authorization
[01:40:36.680 --> 01:40:38.680]  act the new order they've got
[01:40:38.680 --> 01:40:40.680]  to watch the
[01:40:42.680 --> 01:40:44.680]  Broncos and the
[01:40:46.680 --> 01:40:48.680]  who played last night the Broncos and the patriots
[01:40:48.680 --> 01:40:50.680]  and I know people were watching and stuff
[01:40:50.680 --> 01:40:54.680]  who won that game last night
[01:40:58.680 --> 01:41:00.680]  no no no that's not what was on last night
[01:41:00.680 --> 01:41:02.680]  because they were in here watching it during the show
[01:41:02.680 --> 01:41:04.680]  it was
[01:41:04.680 --> 01:41:06.680]  I'm proud of you two that you didn't know
[01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:08.680]  but
[01:41:08.680 --> 01:41:10.680]  you were
[01:41:10.680 --> 01:41:12.680]  researching the new order probably hanging out with your family
[01:41:12.680 --> 01:41:14.680]  but I mean seriously
[01:41:14.680 --> 01:41:16.680]  it's okay
[01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:18.680]  now I kind of want to know who won that game
[01:41:18.680 --> 01:41:20.680]  with Tebow you know last night
[01:41:20.680 --> 01:41:22.680]  but the point is
[01:41:22.680 --> 01:41:24.680]  it sucks you in
[01:41:24.680 --> 01:41:26.680]  to where
[01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:28.680]  it's like you're weird
[01:41:28.680 --> 01:41:30.680]  if you're not going to the human sacrifice at the
[01:41:30.680 --> 01:41:32.680]  Aztec temple or you're weird
[01:41:32.680 --> 01:41:34.680]  if you're not helping knock out windows of
[01:41:34.680 --> 01:41:36.680]  somebody's business and dragging them off to a concentration
[01:41:36.680 --> 01:41:38.680]  camp in Germany
[01:41:38.680 --> 01:41:40.680]  I mean I mean when the whole group is going
[01:41:40.680 --> 01:41:42.680]  along with it we're designed to kind of go along
[01:41:42.680 --> 01:41:44.680]  with it and so a bunch of guys
[01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:46.680]  out there fighting each other and simulated combat
[01:41:46.680 --> 01:41:48.680]  carrying a pig skin
[01:41:48.680 --> 01:41:50.680]  down the
[01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:52.680]  the Patriots one okay
[01:41:52.680 --> 01:41:54.680]  carrying it down the green
[01:41:54.680 --> 01:41:56.680]  we'll see America safe then the Patriots one
[01:41:56.680 --> 01:41:58.680]  everything's fine we can go back to sleep now
[01:42:04.680 --> 01:42:06.680]  and everything becomes a referendum
[01:42:06.680 --> 01:42:08.680]  it's like if Tebow doesn't win
[01:42:08.680 --> 01:42:10.680]  he God isn't on his side
[01:42:10.680 --> 01:42:12.680]  it's all this
[01:42:12.680 --> 01:42:14.680]  baloney
[01:42:14.680 --> 01:42:16.680]  that were fed
[01:42:16.680 --> 01:42:18.680]  I mean look
[01:42:18.680 --> 01:42:20.680]  I understand watching a football game and getting into the characters
[01:42:20.680 --> 01:42:22.680]  and knowing the stats
[01:42:22.680 --> 01:42:24.680]  any system gets interesting when you put enough
[01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:26.680]  time into it
[01:42:26.680 --> 01:42:28.680]  studies
[01:42:28.680 --> 01:42:30.680]  show that humans doing monotonous jobs
[01:42:30.680 --> 01:42:32.680]  putting bottle caps on things or whatever
[01:42:32.680 --> 01:42:34.680]  overseeing factories will end up making
[01:42:34.680 --> 01:42:36.680]  little jokes out of it and we'll see
[01:42:36.680 --> 01:42:38.680]  how fast they can do it or how slow
[01:42:38.680 --> 01:42:40.680]  or you know make little games
[01:42:40.680 --> 01:42:42.680]  with their buddies on the assembly line
[01:42:42.680 --> 01:42:44.680]  humans tend to make things
[01:42:44.680 --> 01:42:46.680]  that they have to do fun
[01:42:46.680 --> 01:42:48.680]  and in my view the only thing fun
[01:42:48.680 --> 01:42:50.680]  about football is playing
[01:42:50.680 --> 01:42:52.680]  but that's like the fun
[01:42:52.680 --> 01:42:54.680]  of getting in a fist fight I guess it's fun
[01:42:54.680 --> 01:42:56.680]  if you've got to get in the fist fight
[01:42:58.680 --> 01:43:00.680]  I mean it's
[01:43:00.680 --> 01:43:02.680]  simulated combat folks
[01:43:02.680 --> 01:43:04.680]  combat's for a reason
[01:43:04.680 --> 01:43:06.680]  you've got an instinct to see your guys
[01:43:06.680 --> 01:43:08.680]  run out of the dark cave opening
[01:43:08.680 --> 01:43:10.680]  charging out to meet the other team
[01:43:10.680 --> 01:43:12.680]  and you've got your maidens down there
[01:43:12.680 --> 01:43:14.680]  dancing alluringly
[01:43:14.680 --> 01:43:16.680]  you're fighting for your maidens
[01:43:16.680 --> 01:43:18.680]  and the rest of the tribe is
[01:43:18.680 --> 01:43:20.680]  hunga, hunga, win, win, win
[01:43:20.680 --> 01:43:22.680]  everybody's painted up crazy
[01:43:22.680 --> 01:43:24.680]  it's pure psychological warfare
[01:43:28.680 --> 01:43:30.680]  yeah
[01:43:30.680 --> 01:43:32.680]  lemmings going off a cliff
[01:43:32.680 --> 01:43:34.680]  I mean that's what they're doing
[01:43:34.680 --> 01:43:36.680]  and then you tell people hey you know
[01:43:36.680 --> 01:43:38.680]  they're trying to pass a law
[01:43:38.680 --> 01:43:40.680]  on the streets of secretly arrest us
[01:43:40.680 --> 01:43:42.680]  oh that'll never happen come on
[01:43:42.680 --> 01:43:44.680]  and then it happens and the same people tell me
[01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:46.680]  alright what are you going to do about it then
[01:43:46.680 --> 01:43:48.680]  see it's always oh that doesn't exist
[01:43:48.680 --> 01:43:50.680]  oh that's not going on
[01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:52.680]  oh that's not going to happen
[01:43:52.680 --> 01:43:54.680]  oh it's not going to
[01:43:54.680 --> 01:43:56.680]  and that's why people every time who go under tyranny
[01:43:56.680 --> 01:43:58.680]  almost every case cannot resist it
[01:43:58.680 --> 01:44:00.680]  because they just keep hoping
[01:44:00.680 --> 01:44:02.680]  everything's going to be alright
[01:44:04.680 --> 01:44:06.680]  I mean I see grown adults in videos
[01:44:06.680 --> 01:44:08.680]  online when a dog attacks them
[01:44:08.680 --> 01:44:10.680]  people will ball up
[01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:12.680]  men
[01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:14.680]  because the rock wall are so scary
[01:44:14.680 --> 01:44:16.680]  I mean I don't want to get into stories
[01:44:16.680 --> 01:44:18.680]  or anything but I've had big dogs run up
[01:44:18.680 --> 01:44:20.680]  and try to bite me a few times and I got bit
[01:44:20.680 --> 01:44:22.680]  and I mean
[01:44:22.680 --> 01:44:24.680]  you know what just jump up and stomp on them
[01:44:24.680 --> 01:44:26.680]  believe me you break one of their legs
[01:44:26.680 --> 01:44:28.680]  I mean and I'm not some tough guy
[01:44:28.680 --> 01:44:30.680]  some big dog runs up and tries to attack me
[01:44:30.680 --> 01:44:32.680]  I'm going to kick it in the face
[01:44:32.680 --> 01:44:34.680]  and then if it gets in and hits me in the leg
[01:44:34.680 --> 01:44:36.680]  then wild ape I'm going to jump up
[01:44:36.680 --> 01:44:38.680]  with both legs and stomp it
[01:44:42.680 --> 01:44:44.680]  I mean multiple times one time with the pit bull
[01:44:44.680 --> 01:44:46.680]  one time with some giant sheep dog
[01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:48.680]  when we grew up on the golf course came running out of somebody's backyard
[01:44:48.680 --> 01:44:50.680]  ran down started biting my buddy
[01:44:50.680 --> 01:44:52.680]  I ran over I was like 12 years old
[01:44:52.680 --> 01:44:54.680]  started punching it it was biting my hands
[01:44:54.680 --> 01:44:56.680]  but I started punching its eyes out
[01:44:56.680 --> 01:44:58.680]  basically and it ran off
[01:44:58.680 --> 01:45:00.680]  but the point is is that
[01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:02.680]  I see grown men oh the dog
[01:45:02.680 --> 01:45:04.680]  get on and they just lay there while it's biting
[01:45:04.680 --> 01:45:06.680]  I mean what how did you get turned into this
[01:45:06.680 --> 01:45:08.680]  I mean it's kind of fun
[01:45:08.680 --> 01:45:10.680]  when a pit bull runs out to stood
[01:45:10.680 --> 01:45:12.680]  I mean I'm not excited about it but okay
[01:45:12.680 --> 01:45:14.680]  you're running out of your garage you're trying to bite me
[01:45:14.680 --> 01:45:16.680]  I'm going to start stomping on you
[01:45:16.680 --> 01:45:18.680]  I mean I'm built to do that
[01:45:18.680 --> 01:45:20.680]  I don't I don't
[01:45:20.680 --> 01:45:22.680]  I'm nobody folks
[01:45:22.680 --> 01:45:24.680]  I'm not looking for trouble
[01:45:24.680 --> 01:45:26.680]  because I know what troubles like because I've been there
[01:45:26.680 --> 01:45:32.680]  I don't understand it
[01:45:32.680 --> 01:45:34.680]  I mean somebody comes up to me and punches me
[01:45:34.680 --> 01:45:36.680]  I'm okay
[01:45:36.680 --> 01:45:38.680]  you want to get punched back it's going to happen
[01:45:38.680 --> 01:45:40.680]  and I don't get grown adults
[01:45:40.680 --> 01:45:42.680]  who ball up
[01:45:42.680 --> 01:45:44.680]  I mean it's one thing if you had five guys beating you up
[01:45:44.680 --> 01:45:46.680]  you were knocked out and couldn't get up
[01:45:46.680 --> 01:45:48.680]  to cover yourself up that's one thing
[01:45:48.680 --> 01:45:50.680]  and I've certainly done that
[01:45:50.680 --> 01:45:52.680]  somebody rings your bell
[01:45:52.680 --> 01:45:54.680]  and you're hearing
[01:45:54.680 --> 01:45:56.680]  and you can't find your legs
[01:45:56.680 --> 01:45:58.680]  and your arms really can't move you just got hit in the head
[01:45:58.680 --> 01:46:00.680]  with post hole diggers there's blood pouring out the back of your head
[01:46:00.680 --> 01:46:02.680]  and you go zzzz but you know what
[01:46:02.680 --> 01:46:04.680]  they tried to kick me in about 30 seconds later
[01:46:04.680 --> 01:46:06.680]  it was like that rear axle connect
[01:46:06.680 --> 01:46:08.680]  it was like whoosh whoosh whoosh whoosh
[01:46:08.680 --> 01:46:10.680]  and boy it was lookout time when I got up
[01:46:10.680 --> 01:46:12.680]  because then it was zombie destruction
[01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:14.680]  the point is humans
[01:46:14.680 --> 01:46:16.680]  ladies and gentlemen
[01:46:16.680 --> 01:46:18.680]  have a capacity to stand up for ourselves
[01:46:18.680 --> 01:46:20.680]  and I don't understand
[01:46:20.680 --> 01:46:22.680]  just giving yourself completely
[01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:24.680]  over to groveling
[01:46:24.680 --> 01:46:26.680]  to corruption
[01:46:26.680 --> 01:46:28.680]  and that's why I'm going to cover this article
[01:46:28.680 --> 01:46:30.680]  and then go to
[01:46:30.680 --> 01:46:32.680]  Peter
[01:46:32.680 --> 01:46:34.680]  and Tim and Jason and Cori and Angie
[01:46:34.680 --> 01:46:36.680]  then I'll get into all the Ron Paul news
[01:46:36.680 --> 01:46:38.680]  but this is some really positive news
[01:46:38.680 --> 01:46:40.680]  and I keep meaning to do an info or as nightly news
[01:46:40.680 --> 01:46:42.680]  on this I saw this one time
[01:46:42.680 --> 01:46:44.680]  and the next time I tried to find it I couldn't find it
[01:46:44.680 --> 01:46:46.680]  but you can pull up
[01:46:46.680 --> 01:46:48.680]  videos of
[01:46:48.680 --> 01:46:50.680]  rioting Chinese they're not rioting
[01:46:50.680 --> 01:46:52.680]  they're fighting against tyranny
[01:46:52.680 --> 01:46:54.680]  and it's always the same
[01:46:54.680 --> 01:46:56.680]  a cop beats the old homeless man to death
[01:46:56.680 --> 01:46:58.680]  they just burn down all the government
[01:46:58.680 --> 01:47:00.680]  buildings and beat police to death
[01:47:00.680 --> 01:47:02.680]  oh you
[01:47:02.680 --> 01:47:04.680]  I mean the Chinese have not been on
[01:47:04.680 --> 01:47:06.680]  fluoride in their water and by the way the government
[01:47:06.680 --> 01:47:08.680]  has now proposed putting lithium in the water
[01:47:08.680 --> 01:47:10.680]  I saw that a few weeks ago so the Chinese
[01:47:10.680 --> 01:47:12.680]  have not been gelded castrated
[01:47:12.680 --> 01:47:14.680]  like we have and I should say they're women
[01:47:14.680 --> 01:47:16.680]  in these videos but there's a bunch of them
[01:47:16.680 --> 01:47:18.680]  I saw this one where they're running up a hill
[01:47:18.680 --> 01:47:20.680]  with hose and hatchets
[01:47:20.680 --> 01:47:22.680]  and stuff and the Chinese police start
[01:47:22.680 --> 01:47:24.680]  shooting them and they just run over them
[01:47:24.680 --> 01:47:26.680]  you see the camera knocked down on the ground
[01:47:26.680 --> 01:47:28.680]  as the people hack them up sure you shot the first
[01:47:28.680 --> 01:47:30.680]  group of them but they were sick of being
[01:47:30.680 --> 01:47:32.680]  your slave and it's over
[01:47:32.680 --> 01:47:34.680]  and they tried to round them up
[01:47:34.680 --> 01:47:36.680]  and put them in reeducation camps
[01:47:36.680 --> 01:47:38.680]  and break up the families but there were always
[01:47:38.680 --> 01:47:40.680]  so many North Korea was smaller
[01:47:40.680 --> 01:47:42.680]  so they were able to fully break humanity
[01:47:44.680 --> 01:47:46.680]  at least physically
[01:47:46.680 --> 01:47:48.680]  you saw that fake crying earlier
[01:47:48.680 --> 01:47:50.680]  that they're not really mentally broken
[01:47:50.680 --> 01:47:52.680]  they know it's a bunch of baloney but they still are dominated
[01:47:52.680 --> 01:47:54.680]  through the caste system
[01:47:54.680 --> 01:47:56.680]  through the corrupt police state communist system
[01:47:58.680 --> 01:48:00.680]  but to watch
[01:48:00.680 --> 01:48:02.680]  and by the way as I said I saw
[01:48:02.680 --> 01:48:04.680]  a number just a few months ago earlier in the year
[01:48:04.680 --> 01:48:06.680]  where it was a 7,000 riots
[01:48:06.680 --> 01:48:08.680]  in the previous 12 months
[01:48:08.680 --> 01:48:10.680]  China villagers
[01:48:10.680 --> 01:48:12.680]  threatened to march on government offices
[01:48:12.680 --> 01:48:14.680]  let me have some other big breaking news
[01:48:16.680 --> 01:48:18.680]  China villagers threatened to march
[01:48:18.680 --> 01:48:20.680]  on government offices
[01:48:20.680 --> 01:48:22.680]  protesting villagers in southern China
[01:48:22.680 --> 01:48:24.680]  said they would march
[01:48:24.680 --> 01:48:26.680]  on government offices this week
[01:48:26.680 --> 01:48:28.680]  unless the body of local
[01:48:28.680 --> 01:48:30.680]  leader is released and four villagers
[01:48:30.680 --> 01:48:32.680]  in police custody are freed
[01:48:32.680 --> 01:48:34.680]  they grab people and inject them
[01:48:34.680 --> 01:48:36.680]  with dish washing cleaning
[01:48:36.680 --> 01:48:38.680]  soap other stuff really nasty
[01:48:38.680 --> 01:48:40.680]  the 13,000 residents
[01:48:40.680 --> 01:48:42.680]  of Wukong in the wealthy province
[01:48:42.680 --> 01:48:44.680]  of Guangdong
[01:48:44.680 --> 01:48:46.680]  I'll pronounce that right
[01:48:46.680 --> 01:48:48.680]  are in open revolt against officialdom
[01:48:48.680 --> 01:48:50.680]  and have driven out local communist
[01:48:50.680 --> 01:48:52.680]  party leaders who they say
[01:48:52.680 --> 01:48:54.680]  have been stealing their land for years
[01:48:54.680 --> 01:48:56.680]  well no kidding they jack up taxes on you
[01:48:56.680 --> 01:48:58.680]  till you can't pay then they take it and take the taxes off
[01:48:58.680 --> 01:49:00.680]  they do that right here in Austin
[01:49:00.680 --> 01:49:02.680]  people roll over to it man
[01:49:02.680 --> 01:49:04.680]  they take your land for environmental reasons five years later
[01:49:04.680 --> 01:49:06.680]  take the land use off and the very council members
[01:49:06.680 --> 01:49:08.680]  that did it then open banks they own
[01:49:08.680 --> 01:49:10.680]  they control the land
[01:49:10.680 --> 01:49:12.680]  I mean it's just criminality right out in the open
[01:49:12.680 --> 01:49:14.680]  and I've run into them sometimes
[01:49:14.680 --> 01:49:16.680]  when I'm in radio and TV studios and they'll see me
[01:49:16.680 --> 01:49:18.680]  and they'll just gasp in fear
[01:49:18.680 --> 01:49:20.680]  and then I don't say anything because I'm there as a guest
[01:49:20.680 --> 01:49:22.680]  and go on off and do the interview I'm doing
[01:49:22.680 --> 01:49:24.680]  because I'm not debating them but they're scared of the public
[01:49:24.680 --> 01:49:26.680]  I mean they can't believe what they've gotten away with
[01:49:26.680 --> 01:49:28.680]  that's what all this police states for
[01:49:28.680 --> 01:49:30.680]  to make sure you don't wake up and send them to prison
[01:49:32.680 --> 01:49:34.680]  many local businesses have been closed the past week
[01:49:34.680 --> 01:49:36.680]  while schools have been shuttered as riot police
[01:49:36.680 --> 01:49:38.680]  blockade the village which has for months been the scene of
[01:49:38.680 --> 01:49:40.680]  occasionally violent protest
[01:49:40.680 --> 01:49:42.680]  over land seizures
[01:49:42.680 --> 01:49:44.680]  authorities have authorities not communist thugs
[01:49:44.680 --> 01:49:46.680]  have vowed to crack down
[01:49:46.680 --> 01:49:48.680]  on instigators of the latest unrest
[01:49:48.680 --> 01:49:50.680]  which was triggered by the arrest
[01:49:50.680 --> 01:49:52.680]  nine days ago of five villagers
[01:49:52.680 --> 01:49:54.680]  one of them died last Sunday in police custody
[01:49:54.680 --> 01:49:56.680]  tortured to death
[01:49:56.680 --> 01:49:58.680]  authorities say the 42 year old man suffered a heart attack
[01:49:58.680 --> 01:50:00.680]  of course he did
[01:50:00.680 --> 01:50:02.680]  while relatives who saw the body said they believed he'd been beaten to death
[01:50:02.680 --> 01:50:04.680]  villagers told AFP
[01:50:04.680 --> 01:50:06.680]  on Sunday they will march
[01:50:06.680 --> 01:50:08.680]  to government offices in Lafing
[01:50:08.680 --> 01:50:10.680]  City on Wednesday unless
[01:50:10.680 --> 01:50:12.680]  the body of Zhu Zhenbo
[01:50:12.680 --> 01:50:14.680]  is returned and other
[01:50:14.680 --> 01:50:16.680]  four villagers still in police custody
[01:50:16.680 --> 01:50:18.680]  are released you know ten years ago our government
[01:50:18.680 --> 01:50:20.680]  would criticize China now they love it
[01:50:20.680 --> 01:50:22.680]  if they do not return
[01:50:22.680 --> 01:50:24.680]  our people then for sure we will march
[01:50:24.680 --> 01:50:26.680]  said the villager
[01:50:26.680 --> 01:50:28.680]  surnamed Zhang
[01:50:28.680 --> 01:50:30.680]  44 who told AFP his family
[01:50:30.680 --> 01:50:32.680]  a lot of farmland has been taken from him in 95
[01:50:32.680 --> 01:50:34.680]  it would be the third such
[01:50:34.680 --> 01:50:36.680]  march since September
[01:50:36.680 --> 01:50:38.680]  communist leaders
[01:50:38.680 --> 01:50:40.680]  have started to collect donations for food and money
[01:50:40.680 --> 01:50:42.680]  for several hundred villagers
[01:50:42.680 --> 01:50:44.680]  struggling to feed themselves due to cordons by police
[01:50:44.680 --> 01:50:46.680]  that's the double game they block you off
[01:50:46.680 --> 01:50:48.680]  so you don't get food but then the good
[01:50:48.680 --> 01:50:50.680]  comies get the food now next
[01:50:50.680 --> 01:50:52.680]  we'll get to where they have actually
[01:50:52.680 --> 01:50:54.680]  going to take over areas on the other side
[01:50:54.680 --> 01:50:56.680]  of course they're known as terrorists in China

[01:54:27.920 --> 01:54:38.000]  In China if you protest you can be taken to one of hundreds of execution centers
[01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:42.080]  where they blood types you and then advertise your body organs. You were
[01:54:42.080 --> 01:54:46.480]  then when the wealthy Westerner or Japanese person, Russian in that case,
[01:54:46.480 --> 01:54:51.200]  wealthy fly in, they execute you. Now we knew about this 15-16 years ago and we
[01:54:51.200 --> 01:54:54.840]  would be called conspiracy theorists even when it was in mainstream European
[01:54:54.840 --> 01:54:59.320]  paper. Since then it's admitted. You're melted down for cosmetics, the babies are,
[01:54:59.320 --> 01:55:03.360]  the collagen injections, the higher quality, more expensive ones are from
[01:55:03.360 --> 01:55:07.880]  dead Chinese dissidents, predominantly babies. The children are sent to
[01:55:07.880 --> 01:55:12.600]  reeducation camps but if the elite need young organs they'll kill kids and it's
[01:55:12.600 --> 01:55:16.560]  since all been confirmed and admitted. In fact that's kind of flipped though.
[01:55:16.560 --> 01:55:20.600]  Mainstream media admits China sells political dissidents organs and they
[01:55:20.600 --> 01:55:25.960]  did in 15 years ago but 15 years ago the State Department decried it but it was
[01:55:25.960 --> 01:55:28.720]  like six years ago the State Department put out a report you can pull it up.
[01:55:28.720 --> 01:55:35.440]  State Department denies China selling organs. Period. I mean that's like denying
[01:55:35.440 --> 01:55:41.800]  the sun came up this morning and again it's that denial. I was on national
[01:55:41.800 --> 01:55:45.640]  Spanish radio in Spain today. It's actually European-wide. It's English
[01:55:45.640 --> 01:55:52.040]  radio, English-speaking radio out of out of Spain and the host had callers
[01:55:52.040 --> 01:55:57.200]  asking him about well USA Today says the NDAA doesn't affect citizens. There's
[01:55:57.200 --> 01:56:03.000]  Ron Ball and Alex Jones lying and I just said to the host I said look you just
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:06.920]  need to go and get all the senators admitting it and you can pull up the
[01:56:06.920 --> 01:56:15.840]  subsection where it says it affects citizens. But again people say people say
[01:56:15.840 --> 01:56:25.680]  to us well if it's sometimes I get distracted as they put something up on
[01:56:25.680 --> 01:56:28.080]  screen and then I start reading it and then I forget the last thing I was
[01:56:28.080 --> 01:56:34.000]  talking about. Oh people ask well if they get caught lying all the time why do
[01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:37.600]  they do it because it doesn't matter even if they get caught lying. It makes the
[01:56:37.600 --> 01:56:43.640]  discussion about is this going on and are you a liar instead of the discussion
[01:56:43.640 --> 01:56:47.640]  being why are you taking people's political dissonance organs and why are
[01:56:47.640 --> 01:56:52.360]  Americans and others buying them. It's one thing to buy something from China you
[01:56:52.360 --> 01:56:58.320]  can argue well it gives them some job. But it's another thing entirely to say
[01:56:58.320 --> 01:57:02.120]  I'll take an organ from somebody who's dead. People are like well how about you
[01:57:02.120 --> 01:57:06.400]  need a liver. I can tell you right now if I needed a liver and it was going to
[01:57:06.400 --> 01:57:12.200]  come from some Chinese dissonant goodbye I'm ready to die. Somebody dies in a car
[01:57:12.200 --> 01:57:18.200]  right great I'll take their liver. But this is such a no-brainer. I don't want to
[01:57:18.200 --> 01:57:23.760]  live in a world where we're cannibalizing each other for each other's body parts.
[01:57:23.760 --> 01:57:27.760]  Now let's talk about our children what if your child needed it somebody else had
[01:57:27.760 --> 01:57:33.520]  to die. I'll be honest I'd think about it and I know what I'd say no because I
[01:57:33.520 --> 01:57:38.680]  people like wow you're really a good guy that's a good person today that wouldn't
[01:57:38.680 --> 01:57:44.200]  do that. Folks none of us are safe when we live in a society like that I know I
[01:57:44.200 --> 01:57:47.320]  keep preaching all right here's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna come back and then
[01:57:47.320 --> 01:57:50.880]  two segments get all your calls and then I'm going to get to the Ron Paul news
[01:57:50.880 --> 01:57:54.200]  and the police state news and the UN news that I've already mentioned some of
[01:57:54.200 --> 01:57:57.000]  it and a bunch of other stacks I've even gotten to yet we've covered quite a bit
[01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:02.160]  so far. We've done two hours of radio I haven't plugged any of the specials most
[01:58:02.160 --> 01:58:09.000]  areas in the US can still get video or t-shirt or ball cap orders from the info
[01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:12.400]  or store if you order today it's not guaranteed everywhere in the country you
[01:58:12.400 --> 01:58:15.760]  had to order by last night to do that we have the everything special all 18 of my
[01:58:15.760 --> 01:58:20.080]  films on DVD and your purchase finances our operation what we're doing I want to
[01:58:20.080 --> 01:58:23.040]  thank you but then you get 18 gifts to give people but so what if you don't get
[01:58:23.040 --> 01:58:27.480]  by Christmas it's a great gift to give 18 people your police chief your

[01:58:54.920 --> 01:58:58.640]  hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know
[01:58:58.640 --> 01:59:02.480]  that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or
[01:59:02.480 --> 01:59:05.840]  gold it's true seeds that all perform even gold and silver before in this
[01:59:05.840 --> 01:59:09.640]  country and it's possible that could even happen again so our friends at
[01:59:09.640 --> 01:59:14.080]  Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they

[01:59:53.680 --> 02:00:01.440]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network

[02:00:20.440 --> 02:00:24.080]  Alex Jones
[02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:39.360]  ladies and gentlemen we are now into our number three and while this is going
[02:00:39.360 --> 02:00:45.400]  to be a jam-packed hour coming up later Windows 8 to feature image sign-on system
[02:00:45.400 --> 02:00:49.440]  a face scan I told you that was coming to buy and sell how do I know I've read
[02:00:49.440 --> 02:00:53.840]  what MIT DARPA and the big companies are saying a decade ago was a plan
[02:00:53.840 --> 02:00:58.240]  face scanning cameras going up everywhere Walter Reed accidentally bans
[02:00:58.240 --> 02:01:02.760]  Bibles and this illustrates I'll talk about it later but I see articles all
[02:01:02.760 --> 02:01:07.920]  the time where schools go now no Christmas stuff officially but children
[02:01:07.920 --> 02:01:12.280]  are allowed to give cookies or Christmas cards individually they have a right of
[02:01:12.280 --> 02:01:16.800]  association because the schools go no religion in school do not say the name
[02:01:16.800 --> 02:01:21.240]  Jesus I and I've seen cases where they grab Bibles out of people's bags and
[02:01:21.240 --> 02:01:27.200]  throw them in the trash and scream at them I mean it's amazing what they've
[02:01:27.200 --> 02:01:32.160]  done with ignorance so I'm gonna talk about that the Ron Paul situation
[02:01:32.160 --> 02:01:37.360]  obviously so big that something that big you know him in the in the in the front
[02:01:37.360 --> 02:01:40.920]  runner now and then I want to try to spend time on it and time gets away from
[02:01:40.920 --> 02:01:46.160]  me but I will cover it at 20 after Peter in Washington then Tim and others go
[02:01:46.160 --> 02:01:55.920]  ahead hello hello sir thank you for holding yes I just have some kind of a
[02:01:55.920 --> 02:02:00.160]  footnote to what you do you can hear me yes I can hear it on your speakerphone
[02:02:00.160 --> 02:02:09.840]  quite well good and that Oswald Spengler in his famous book 1918 classic the
[02:02:09.840 --> 02:02:18.080]  decline of the West stated that Cecil Rhodes was the prototype of the last
[02:02:18.080 --> 02:02:25.720]  phase of Western civilization now he was a determinist and I know you're not but
[02:02:25.720 --> 02:02:34.200]  you might find it interesting so let me read a paragraph from it okay there's
[02:02:34.200 --> 02:02:41.480]  Rhodes is to be regarded as the first precursor of a Western type of Caesar's
[02:02:41.480 --> 02:02:47.680]  whose day is to come though distant he stands midway between Napoleon and the
[02:02:47.680 --> 02:02:55.120]  force man of the next centuries just as Plominius who from 232 BC onward pressed
[02:02:55.120 --> 02:03:01.320]  the Romans to undertake the subjugation of Cishapine Gaul and so initiated the
[02:03:01.320 --> 02:03:07.280]  policy of colonial expansion stands between Alexander and Caesar strictly
[02:03:07.280 --> 02:03:13.560]  speaking Plominius was a private person for its real power was a kind not
[02:03:13.560 --> 02:03:18.880]  embodied in any constitutional office who exercised the dominant influence in
[02:03:18.880 --> 02:03:23.920]  the state at a time when the state idea was getting away to the pressure of
[02:03:23.920 --> 02:03:30.280]  economic factors so far as Rome is concerned he was the architect of
[02:03:30.280 --> 02:03:36.400]  opposition Caesarism with him there came an end to the idea of state service and
[02:03:36.400 --> 02:03:42.520]  there began the will of power to power with ignored traditions and reckoned
[02:03:42.520 --> 02:03:48.640]  only with forces Alexander and Napoleon were Romanics so they stood on the
[02:03:48.640 --> 02:03:54.760]  threshold of civilization and its cold clear air the one fancied himself and
[02:03:54.760 --> 02:04:02.640]  Achilles and the other Red Bertha Caesar on the contrary was a pure man of fact
[02:04:02.640 --> 02:04:07.760]  gifted with immense understanding now the next paragraph I don't know if you've
[02:04:07.760 --> 02:04:13.120]  got time is on roads go ahead but even for roads political
[02:04:13.120 --> 02:04:19.080]  success meant territorial and financial success and only that of this Romanus
[02:04:19.080 --> 02:04:24.040]  within him he was fully aware but Western civilization has not yet taken
[02:04:24.040 --> 02:04:30.280]  shape in such strength and purity as this it was only before his maps that he
[02:04:30.280 --> 02:04:36.400]  could fall into a sort of poetic trance well that's very that's very
[02:04:36.400 --> 02:04:40.800]  interesting and you know that's a classic I've actually never read that
[02:04:40.800 --> 02:04:44.760]  book that you mentioned but I should probably should but undoubtedly that's
[02:04:44.760 --> 02:04:48.960]  what this is about and you can't have an empire and not become a police state
[02:04:48.960 --> 02:04:54.320]  yourself the Empire brings the tools of tyranny to other nations subjugation
[02:04:54.320 --> 02:05:00.040]  domination and invariably brings them back home brings the troops back to Rome
[02:05:00.040 --> 02:05:06.200]  a very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most
[02:05:06.200 --> 02:05:10.720]  important day in America in more than 50 years he says it will change every
[02:05:10.720 --> 02:05:14.760]  thing about our lives the way you shop travel invest educate your children and
[02:05:14.760 --> 02:05:18.240]  even how you take care of your health and your own family now this man has made
[02:05:18.240 --> 02:05:22.000]  some outrageous predictions over the years the crazy part is he's usually
[02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:25.000]  right you see he predicted the collapse of GM
[02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:28.120]  Annie Mae Freddie Mac and America's biggest mall owner general growth
[02:05:28.120 --> 02:05:33.280]  properties in fact Barron's called his work a dire prophecy recently he created
[02:05:33.280 --> 02:05:36.720]  a video which you can watch online for free detailing his biggest and most
[02:05:36.720 --> 02:05:40.840]  important prediction yet and it's a real eye-opener I can't stress this enough

[02:08:25.840 --> 02:08:30.760]  christian evangelicals to join the dark side he says hey I'll arrest judges that
[02:08:30.760 --> 02:08:37.280]  make immoral rulings I told you you can't do that you can move to have
[02:08:37.280 --> 02:08:43.680]  judges impeached by the judiciary above them or by the legislative branch but
[02:08:43.680 --> 02:08:50.960]  not by the president and you don't do it until there's been a trial see as soon
[02:08:50.960 --> 02:08:55.040]  as they get rid of this idea of well the military can be on the streets and by
[02:08:55.040 --> 02:08:58.000]  the way you know what follows we're gonna arrest you and have you disappear no
[02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:03.280]  trial remember all the years I told you that was coming and I interviewed the
[02:09:03.280 --> 02:09:07.440]  judge advocate generals retired admirals and they said yeah this this is what
[02:09:07.440 --> 02:09:11.800]  they're setting up I mean legal scholars Bruce fine is one of the top
[02:09:11.800 --> 02:09:18.080]  advisors to congress the top of his class multiple degrees top scholar he'll
[02:09:18.080 --> 02:09:23.480]  tell you we are galloping in to marshal law ron paul I mean that's what it is
[02:09:23.480 --> 02:09:29.600]  that's history and so now newt genrich all cover that for the ron paul news app
[02:09:29.600 --> 02:09:34.280]  for some more calls he's saying well like me I'll start arresting people who are
[02:09:34.280 --> 02:09:38.720]  immoral you mean that have three wives and leave wives that are you know think
[02:09:38.720 --> 02:09:42.760]  they're dying of cancer fighting cancer and I got the talks about frugalness and
[02:09:42.760 --> 02:09:49.200]  as a $600,000 account at Tiffany's and be one thing if you invented some engine
[02:09:49.200 --> 02:09:53.440]  and made $10,000,000 and you were buying your wife a you know $600,000 account or
[02:09:53.440 --> 02:09:56.840]  whatever that still I'm not in a conspicuous consumption I think it's
[02:09:56.840 --> 02:10:04.160]  pretty pretty gross at a certain level but I'm not gonna judge you but the
[02:10:04.160 --> 02:10:09.800]  point is to sit there and have it from money from lobbying and and selling
[02:10:09.800 --> 02:10:16.200]  carbon taxes and socialist health care you you pig you you just swollen sack of
[02:10:16.200 --> 02:10:24.360]  evil degeneracy and and an ego you make me want to throw up I don't want to go
[02:10:24.360 --> 02:10:27.600]  into my analysis again because it's long but I've read his books I've read the
[02:10:27.600 --> 02:10:31.560]  forwards he's written I read the stuff he wrote as a college professor and man
[02:10:31.560 --> 02:10:40.200]  they tell you he's in the inner club he's a bad one he's a bad bad bad person and
[02:10:40.200 --> 02:10:43.960]  I told you as long as people find out who he is he'll be destroyed just like
[02:10:43.960 --> 02:10:47.560]  everybody else the system thinks Mitt Romney is the one that's gonna make it
[02:10:47.560 --> 02:10:52.760]  but he's got a lot of the same dirt as newt Gennrich he's not Germanic I've
[02:10:52.760 --> 02:10:56.040]  looked at Mitt Romney studied him gauged him he I don't think he's an evil
[02:10:56.040 --> 02:11:02.240]  person Rick Perry is completely out of his mind and used to be on a power trip
[02:11:02.240 --> 02:11:05.000]  now his balloons been popped because he's probably being blackmailed he's
[02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:09.800]  totally broken down and now it's just a little nilly he's reverted to that that
[02:11:09.800 --> 02:11:19.360]  personality he's got I mean have you seen him out there it's like a I don't
[02:11:19.360 --> 02:11:23.600]  know what you call it anyways the
[02:11:23.600 --> 02:11:30.200]  you know kind of that Nellie-ness of Don Delewies or whatever is Don Delewies
[02:11:30.200 --> 02:11:37.960]  the right name of kind of the Nelly Nanny is it Don Delewies yeah okay Don
[02:11:37.960 --> 02:11:45.720]  yeah whatever the point is they're all sinking as you find out about them it's
[02:11:45.720 --> 02:11:51.600]  over as you find out about Herman Cain gone his lies got so ridiculous yes for
[02:11:51.600 --> 02:11:56.760]  13 and a half years I paid her rent but never told my wife but nothing's going
[02:11:56.760 --> 02:12:03.160]  on we were just friends I thought we were friends that'd be like if I got a
[02:12:03.160 --> 02:12:07.080]  beer on there and said hey for this Christmas buy the everything special for
[02:12:07.080 --> 02:12:14.360]  your wife and your girlfriend oh I just paid her rent honey cuz for 13 years

[02:12:35.680 --> 02:12:39.840]  Christianoids on radio going he's reasonable to help people heard a local
[02:12:39.840 --> 02:12:47.520]  talk show host code name the chipmunk he's a nice guy but I heard Sergeant
[02:12:47.520 --> 02:12:53.080]  chipmunk on the air going call him sergeant chipmunk as they've got this
[02:12:53.080 --> 02:12:56.600]  little piece they do where they they play his voice on the next show sped up
[02:12:56.600 --> 02:13:01.320]  like a chipmunk it's really funny he's funny when he's on there too he's a
[02:13:01.320 --> 02:13:05.720]  good guy but the point is he's like cuz you already endorsed Herman Cain he's
[02:13:05.720 --> 02:13:09.400]  like well you know in our church we have a lot of women coming needing help but
[02:13:09.400 --> 02:13:14.840]  I you know maybe he probably was just helping her yeah yeah he was helping her
[02:13:14.840 --> 02:13:18.880]  for 13 and a half years with her rent money come on the one thing if it was a
[02:13:18.880 --> 02:13:23.200]  little old lady next door to you and you and your wife are wealthy but you live
[02:13:23.200 --> 02:13:27.080]  in a rural area there's a poor old lady next door yeah that I might buy that
[02:13:27.080 --> 02:13:30.840]  yeah you gave her money for 13 and a half years till she went to the nursing
[02:13:30.840 --> 02:13:36.120]  home I mean I've bought individuals and groups of kids
[02:13:36.120 --> 02:13:41.240]  hospital beds or disabled kids never really told that story on air but I
[02:13:41.240 --> 02:13:46.640]  have I've given money to charities fire departments
[02:13:47.600 --> 02:13:50.880]  Salvation Army and stuff I don't sit there and you know run around and talk
[02:13:50.880 --> 02:13:55.320]  about I guess I am now but no one would buy that okay I'm digressing I said I
[02:13:55.320 --> 02:13:58.480]  get to the wrong poll news in your calls
[02:13:58.480 --> 02:14:03.200]  Gennrich says he would arrest radical judges who step out of line well I'm
[02:14:03.200 --> 02:14:08.320]  you mean out of Kim Jong-il's line and again these judges are out of control
[02:14:08.320 --> 02:14:17.120]  they were appointed by the corrupt executive branch in many cases and
[02:14:17.120 --> 02:14:24.120]  confirmed by the corrupt legislative branch and in other cases they were
[02:14:24.120 --> 02:14:31.160]  elected and you are going to arrest them if they get out of line how about we
[02:14:31.160 --> 02:14:36.120]  elect good people and then they don't appoint bad judges or if judges get out
[02:14:36.120 --> 02:14:40.960]  of hand the judiciary above them have some removed we've got systems for this
[02:14:40.960 --> 02:14:46.640]  oh but no we'll have newt Gennrich arrest them and now we have the NDA that
[02:14:46.640 --> 02:14:50.440]  Obama says he's gonna sign hadn't signed it yet
[02:14:50.600 --> 02:14:55.160]  where you just disappear into a black hole see none of this is just going to be
[02:14:55.160 --> 02:14:59.680]  used on Al Qaeda the people that NATO inserts into countries and yet I talked
[02:14:59.680 --> 02:15:02.960]  to good old boys all the time they'll be like Alex I like you but I just can't
[02:15:02.960 --> 02:15:09.800]  believe 9-11's an inside job and I'm like the US government agents have
[02:15:09.800 --> 02:15:12.280]  admitted they were ordered to let the hijackers into the country they were
[02:15:12.280 --> 02:15:16.080]  protected somewhere trained at US military bases I know I've seen some of
[02:15:16.080 --> 02:15:19.320]  that but I just can't believe it well our government had Amaral Alaki at the
[02:15:19.320 --> 02:15:23.200]  Pentagon meeting in secret number three in Al Qaeda I mean our government put
[02:15:23.200 --> 02:15:28.760]  them in charge in Libya Alex I just can't listen to you I I I can't believe
[02:15:28.760 --> 02:15:33.400]  it okay well then that's why you're a slave that's why stuff's gonna get a
[02:15:33.400 --> 02:15:37.640]  lot worse because there if you'll put up with all of this what else are you
[02:15:37.640 --> 02:15:43.520]  gonna put up with all right let's go to your calls not a control today Tim in

[02:15:59.160 --> 02:16:03.840]  wanted to share a audio clip with you that I recorded when I called my local
[02:16:03.840 --> 02:16:08.240]  sheriff's department and asked him about 1867 I cleaned it up by there's no
[02:16:08.240 --> 02:16:12.000]  names in it then I cut out all the dead spots but I want you to listen to this
[02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:17.800]  lady one as soon as I say 1867 you can almost hear ago and then they pretend
[02:16:17.800 --> 02:16:21.000]  to like put me on hold I don't know if you thought I was on holder wait wait
[02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:27.120]  she actually knew what the NDA bill was it sounds like she goes oh I've got one
[02:16:27.120 --> 02:16:31.320]  of them that can see well no I'm sure she didn't know what it was but they
[02:16:31.320 --> 02:16:35.720]  teach them if they say codes and numbers I have the training manuals in the
[02:16:35.720 --> 02:16:41.200]  video as we've seen them if they talk fancy talk it's paper terror if Bank of
[02:16:41.200 --> 02:16:45.080]  America is taking their house and they come in and tell the judge and I've seen
[02:16:45.080 --> 02:16:50.760]  the judges say this bailiff arrest that man for content but but sir I own the
[02:16:50.760 --> 02:16:55.160]  house outright I have the deed they've got to show the deed it's perjury arrest
[02:16:55.160 --> 02:17:00.960]  the paper terrorist Bank of America gave money to my campaign take take his
[02:17:00.960 --> 02:17:05.600]  property and then of course the answer is arrest him and the answer is we'll let
[02:17:05.600 --> 02:17:09.120]  newt gingrich arrest that judge he's not gonna arrest that judge that judge is a
[02:17:09.120 --> 02:17:14.600]  tyrant like him I'm sorry tell me about this clip is coming up that very point
[02:17:14.600 --> 02:17:18.040]  that you just mentioned I think she thought I was on hold but I wasn't
[02:17:18.040 --> 02:17:22.660]  because I could hear her contact another officer who said we need to have an NC
[02:17:22.660 --> 02:17:27.800]  I see on this person listen listen listen if you say
[02:17:27.800 --> 02:17:31.560]  Constitution to a lot of cops now that aren't awake and I got video they

[02:17:54.480 --> 02:17:59.720]  county I was wondering what shares is going to do to protect us from this S
[02:17:59.720 --> 02:18:06.280]  1867 bill that's that's going through Congress in specific sections 1031 and
[02:18:06.280 --> 02:18:18.400]  and 1032
[02:18:18.400 --> 02:18:22.120]  no they did not

[02:18:56.880 --> 02:19:01.880]  about you better have a car drive by there I'm sorry go ahead
[02:19:01.880 --> 02:19:05.440]  funny cuz like ten minutes after that I heard sirens up and down the street it
[02:19:05.440 --> 02:19:08.520]  was an ambulance going to one of the neighbor's houses and one more quick
[02:19:08.520 --> 02:19:14.560]  thing that's sort of a Spartacus that we all can do I am a Spartacus I took my
[02:19:14.560 --> 02:19:17.920]  driver's license when I got my new one first thing I do when I brought it home
[02:19:17.920 --> 02:19:20.360]  I took it out and put it on the workbench and I whacked it like a hundred
[02:19:20.360 --> 02:19:24.280]  times with a ball peen hammer then I put it in the microwave for ten minutes
[02:19:24.280 --> 02:19:31.120]  then I took a sharp knife and I scraped off the black line on the back I'm
[02:19:31.120 --> 02:19:36.920]  doing the same thing with my slave ID when I went to do a return purchase to a
[02:19:36.920 --> 02:19:43.000]  major retailer very interesting I was in the store like a half an hour earlier
[02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:46.040]  I pay with a credit card and they did not even ask me for any idea but when I
[02:19:46.040 --> 02:19:49.680]  wanted to do the return they did well right away she went to swipe it in the
[02:19:49.680 --> 02:19:53.040]  thing and she pointed she showed it to me she goes where's all the stuff on the
[02:19:53.040 --> 02:19:56.560]  back and I've just played dumb I'm like well what's what's supposed to be on the
[02:19:56.560 --> 02:19:59.800]  back I didn't know they were supposed to listen this is all Patriot Act
[02:19:59.800 --> 02:20:04.400]  compliance where they all get to be little spies at rental car places hotels
[02:20:04.400 --> 02:20:08.200]  but see something say something okay okay I see a government shipping narcotics

[02:20:11.680 --> 02:20:16.480]  warned if you heard that that I'm the bad person no you've been brainwashed by
[02:20:16.480 --> 02:20:27.400]  the bad guys that the good guys are bad but I went in to a rural place where you
[02:20:27.400 --> 02:20:32.560]  work out this weekend a YMCA because I don't like having to drive you just now
[02:20:32.560 --> 02:20:36.440]  live outside Austin and I'm not and I never get into town to work out it's
[02:20:36.440 --> 02:20:39.320]  been working out at home I don't have a lot of weights there so the point is I
[02:20:39.320 --> 02:20:44.720]  went to get a membership and I get in there and the lady was nice at first
[02:20:44.720 --> 02:20:51.360]  at the YMCA she goes oh hello yes I we suggest you wait till the 6th the 26th
[02:20:51.360 --> 02:20:56.440]  of December because for five days until the new year until the second or

[02:21:03.920 --> 02:21:10.680]  or whatever to work out now well she said oh no we have a three-day or three
[02:21:10.680 --> 02:21:16.440]  workout something or other I forget the name of it and so I said okay I'll do
[02:21:16.440 --> 02:21:21.680]  that she's under your driver's license and she got it and she looked at it and
[02:21:21.680 --> 02:21:27.320]  she went in the bag she came back gave to me she said that address that's that's
[02:21:27.320 --> 02:21:33.360]  in Austin and I'm talking I'm like five miles from Austin and I'm like yeah she
[02:21:33.360 --> 02:21:38.360]  goes you're supposed to have your new address on there and I was just like but
[02:21:38.360 --> 02:21:42.960]  don't you have anything better to do I mean I'm wearing a workout shirt and
[02:21:42.960 --> 02:21:49.280]  pants I'm clean cut I mean I'm just here at a gym I mean it's not like
[02:21:49.280 --> 02:21:54.760]  Alcatas everywhere I didn't say that I was just like oh yeah I hadn't changed it
[02:21:54.760 --> 02:21:59.760]  yet but but but but but in my mind I was saying that to her and usually I would
[02:21:59.760 --> 02:22:05.560]  but she had this satisfaction and then I did basically you know just say to her
[02:22:05.560 --> 02:22:14.120]  that you know I doesn't matter and then she didn't like it though as I open the
[02:22:14.120 --> 02:22:17.640]  door to go back outside put my wallet in the car because I want to work out with
[02:22:17.640 --> 02:22:23.120]  it that two cars pull up and nobody was hardly even there two cars from Alex
[02:22:23.120 --> 02:22:26.280]  Jones and families get out oh are you gonna work out here and I'm like well
[02:22:26.280 --> 02:22:29.720]  yeah probably they're like oh we're gonna beat the new old order oh my three
[02:22:29.720 --> 02:22:32.760]  year old daughter wants to meet you hi Alex the other car pulls up the family
[02:22:32.760 --> 02:22:38.720]  hi we're battling the new world order and the one was like it's just it's just
[02:22:38.720 --> 02:22:46.880]  insane it's just totally insane so it it's this power trip of digging through
[02:22:46.880 --> 02:22:51.480]  everything it's this power trip of watching and
[02:22:51.480 --> 02:22:55.160]  minding everyone but if you ever say hey do you want to mind the government
[02:22:55.160 --> 02:22:59.840]  like the founder said you want to watch them oh my gosh I was warned about you
[02:22:59.840 --> 02:23:04.160]  you're the bad one and that's why when a cop pulls me over when all the major
[02:23:04.160 --> 02:23:07.840]  laws are ignored the government's caught engaged in every crime you can imagine
[02:23:07.840 --> 02:23:12.400]  constantly and they and the guy wants to give me a ticket for too dark a window
[02:23:12.400 --> 02:23:18.480]  tent I'm just like I want to search your car you want to search mine I want to
[02:23:18.480 --> 02:23:23.400]  search your car statistically if you take criminology you know statistically
[02:23:23.400 --> 02:23:27.320]  cops are more criminal than the average public I want to search your car and the
[02:23:27.320 --> 02:23:32.320]  guys like well what are you serious and I'm like no I'm not serious I'm sick of
[02:23:32.320 --> 02:23:35.520]  it the guys like why aren't you intimidated by me basically I'm like
[02:23:35.520 --> 02:23:41.080]  no I'm not I'm not I'm sick of it well well he was still wanted to play the game
[02:23:41.080 --> 02:23:46.840]  well what's in that drink and I go I don't know it's a green bottle that says
[02:23:46.840 --> 02:23:51.680]  water on it you ever seen a beer bottle has this shape well where do you get them
[02:23:51.680 --> 02:23:56.200]  you get them at the gas station that's where you get them you get them at the
[02:23:56.200 --> 02:23:59.800]  gas station like when I sit here and answer your questions in your mind I'm
[02:23:59.800 --> 02:24:04.080]  the criminal and you're the good guy I don't ship drugs into this country like
[02:24:04.080 --> 02:24:10.840]  your bosses do I mean I just went on for like 10 minutes because I can't play
[02:24:10.840 --> 02:24:20.600]  games with these people anymore I can't play along with it I didn't tell what I
[02:24:20.600 --> 02:24:25.880]  did to the woman because it was a little mean but wasn't that mean it was very
[02:24:25.880 --> 02:24:29.600]  calmly said but it was meant to make her feel bad about herself and I don't like
[02:24:29.600 --> 02:24:34.600]  to do to put people straight that way and I do bad things sometimes you'd hear
[02:24:34.600 --> 02:24:37.960]  what I said to the woman at the YMCA and you think well that's nothing yeah but
[02:24:37.960 --> 02:24:42.440]  it was how it was said the way I shed it was meant to make her feel small and
[02:24:42.440 --> 02:24:46.200]  that's not the type of attack I like to do on people I like to somehow try to
[02:24:46.200 --> 02:24:55.960]  enlighten them and wake them up but I am I'm not a controlled person you know I
[02:24:55.960 --> 02:25:00.400]  tell people when they're getting off on police state stuff I say hey you think
[02:25:00.400 --> 02:25:03.400]  this police state's gonna keep you safe it's gonna destroy you and your family
[02:25:03.400 --> 02:25:07.520]  and when the government takes everything you've got just remember you you put the
[02:25:07.520 --> 02:25:11.200]  rope around your own neck I mean I didn't tell that woman that I did tell a
[02:25:11.200 --> 02:25:14.640]  whole store in New Mexico that and then there was some guy in front of them they
[02:25:14.640 --> 02:25:18.960]  were harassing some some construction worker who look like he was about 50
[02:25:18.960 --> 02:25:21.960]  years old she was harassing him over a six pack of beer and there was a
[02:25:21.960 --> 02:25:26.080]  newspaper right there saying girls night out about checkpoints I brought it in
[02:25:26.080 --> 02:25:29.520]  and showed it to you and it was how great the checkpoints are and how the
[02:25:29.520 --> 02:25:34.080]  girls are gonna get the evil men so and I said oh I said it's alright buddy it's
[02:25:34.080 --> 02:25:37.280]  girls night out and the woman behind the counter is like you bet it's girls night
[02:25:37.280 --> 02:25:41.200]  out you'd be surprised what we women can do okay that's it you're getting the
[02:25:41.200 --> 02:25:46.960]  five-minute speech and a loud one oh I bet you like how your culture is falling
[02:25:46.960 --> 02:25:49.920]  around part around here now your men don't act like men it's because you don't
[02:25:49.920 --> 02:25:53.280]  let them act like men did you know thousands of years ago in Rome they
[02:25:53.280 --> 02:25:57.360]  use the women as the house slaves to keep the men down and spy on them do you
[02:25:57.360 --> 02:26:01.200]  like the psychological warfare she's are shaking actually my uncle said that and
[02:26:01.200 --> 02:26:07.120]  I don't understand it I go good listen to your uncle I'm sick of it and I'm

[02:26:23.320 --> 02:26:27.560]  bunch of bootlicking scum begging to live in North Korea begging to light up

[02:26:36.400 --> 02:26:42.680]  absolutely don't take it wake up America have the merry Christmas and peace out
[02:26:42.680 --> 02:26:45.520]  Alex we love you I'll tell you something about our day Savetta I've talked to
[02:26:45.520 --> 02:26:50.120]  people that were at the mall two weeks ago was in the paper info was comm is
[02:26:50.120 --> 02:26:54.120]  reporting on it actually look at positive pretty fair article and the
[02:26:54.120 --> 02:26:57.040]  statesman I forgot to send it to you chair and you gave it to me actually
[02:26:57.040 --> 02:27:03.400]  maybe you can dig it out but I saw the video and then I ended up talking to
[02:27:03.400 --> 02:27:08.920]  McBreen one of his friends actually knows the girl and they had the code pink
[02:27:08.920 --> 02:27:14.800]  up there protesting the war or whatever in the shopping mall and which are now
[02:27:14.800 --> 02:27:17.400]  the public comments they say the private property but it operates as a
[02:27:17.400 --> 02:27:21.640]  comments and but regardless you can still say the private property thing so
[02:27:21.640 --> 02:27:26.080]  they're silently and I've seen cases remember the city attorney in some
[02:27:26.080 --> 02:27:30.400]  New York town we had him on a few years ago got arrested because he had a peace
[02:27:30.400 --> 02:27:35.120]  on earth shirt and they thought that was an anti-war shirt and the guys like no
[02:27:35.120 --> 02:27:39.560]  manage Christmas time that search that man arrested for peace on earth shirt
[02:27:39.560 --> 02:27:45.640]  Seuss it was like Rochester or something but but the point is is that are
[02:27:45.640 --> 02:27:50.480]  Buffalo I forget it turned out being the city attorney and constitutional lawyer
[02:27:50.480 --> 02:27:55.920]  but he's wearing a peace on earth shirt and they they say take it off and he
[02:27:55.920 --> 02:28:01.000]  says no and they say leave and he says and starts walking away so the guy like
[02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:06.160]  tackled him and all that and last time I heard they settled with him but in
[02:28:06.160 --> 02:28:11.120]  Austin they're having this frozen silent protest where you sit there with a
[02:28:11.120 --> 02:28:15.120]  sign and are just frozen there it is man arrested for wearing peace on earth
[02:28:15.120 --> 02:28:21.160]  t-shirt that's in the progressive but Stephen F. Downs the lawyer for New
[02:28:21.160 --> 02:28:24.760]  York state's Commission on Judicial Conduct so it wasn't with the city it
[02:28:24.760 --> 02:28:30.480]  was the state's Commission on Judicial Conduct was arrested on March 3rd for
[02:28:30.480 --> 02:28:35.280]  using to take off a give peace a chance shirt or no peace on earth shirt okay
[02:28:35.280 --> 02:28:40.960]  that's enough so now you can't wear what you want in America and they're
[02:28:40.960 --> 02:28:45.560]  coming out with AI computer software that reads your shirt and basically tells
[02:28:45.560 --> 02:28:54.600]  you what you can and can't do and face scanning to buy and sell so they tackle
[02:28:54.600 --> 02:28:59.840]  this woman and the cop clearly and she's just a woman asking what is this they
[02:28:59.840 --> 02:29:03.000]  say it's a silent protest here's the sign she holds it they walk up to her and
[02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:06.080]  say is there you part of this she goes yeah and so they start trying to arrest
[02:29:06.080 --> 02:29:11.120]  her and the cop gets her on the ground slams her on the ground and then punches
[02:29:11.120 --> 02:29:18.200]  her full power in the ribs and then you kind of see her leg flail kind of
[02:29:18.200 --> 02:29:21.200]  involuntary towards him like you know when a wild animal attacks you you're
[02:29:21.200 --> 02:29:26.480]  gonna kick back at it and I saw the Austin police chief in the paper saying
[02:29:26.480 --> 02:29:30.360]  oh it looks like an edited tape but no the officer did a good thing all this
[02:29:30.360 --> 02:29:34.920]  stuff folks of course you edit a tape that's an hour long you edit it down to
[02:29:34.920 --> 02:29:39.560]  two minutes the point is in the video they say oh the officer was trying to
[02:29:39.560 --> 02:29:43.600]  get the handcuff on her he wasn't hitting her he clearly is hitting her so
[02:29:43.600 --> 02:29:48.240]  Ardee Savetta there you go oh she she assaulted him they're charging her with
[02:29:48.240 --> 02:29:55.760]  assault like we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the

[02:31:03.680 --> 02:31:08.120]  buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[02:31:08.120 --> 02:31:12.120]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[02:31:12.120 --> 02:31:16.000]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:19.680]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:31:19.680 --> 02:31:24.240]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[02:31:24.240 --> 02:31:28.280]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[02:31:28.280 --> 02:31:32.080]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[02:31:32.080 --> 02:31:35.680]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[02:31:35.680 --> 02:31:40.040]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[02:33:13.160 --> 02:33:16.120]  gonna get to that in a minute and break it down some of the other news but let's
[02:33:16.120 --> 02:33:20.400]  go to your calls here let's talk to Cory in Connecticut thanks for holding her
[02:33:20.400 --> 02:33:26.920]  on the air hey how you doing Alex good hey a quick question here it's a sort of
[02:33:26.920 --> 02:33:30.680]  a sensitive topic here especially in Connecticut but a lot of people are
[02:33:30.680 --> 02:33:35.440]  actually starting to ask this that particularly talking about Ron Paul you
[02:33:35.440 --> 02:33:38.200]  know how you're saying obviously they're gonna try to attack him and stuff but
[02:33:38.200 --> 02:33:41.880]  one of the oddest things is I know you like your source documents and court
[02:33:41.880 --> 02:33:45.680]  cases and all the fellow stuff and I've been following the one probably about
[02:33:45.680 --> 02:33:50.560]  the past year and a half dealing with his eligibility issue and particularly
[02:33:50.560 --> 02:33:57.000]  with his fraudulent social security number and talking about Obama oh yeah and
[02:33:57.000 --> 02:34:01.440]  the rabbit hole seems to be getting deeper here in the state look there's no
[02:34:01.440 --> 02:34:06.440]  doubt Obama is some kind of weird cutout he's definitely was a CIA baby the whole
[02:34:06.440 --> 02:34:10.800]  family I mean he is a Manchurian candidate I mean he is a manufactured
[02:34:10.800 --> 02:34:15.880]  candidate and Kenya says the records have been excised I mean it looks like
[02:34:15.880 --> 02:34:19.280]  he was probably born in Kenyon and then of course they did the fake thing in the
[02:34:19.280 --> 02:34:22.640]  newspaper so they can trick people and say he was born in the US that's
[02:34:22.640 --> 02:34:26.720]  valuable to be an American versus Kenyon you know with the national rights
[02:34:26.720 --> 02:34:33.360]  and and in all that so of course but I mean I'm sorry I'm saying that's
[02:34:33.360 --> 02:34:37.720]  interesting I apologize got you off it's just the fact I watched the Senate
[02:34:37.720 --> 02:34:42.080]  ballot hearing the other day especially with the early faith presiding now more
[02:34:42.080 --> 02:34:46.720]  plaintiffs against him that she brought up the exact case and in dealing with the
[02:34:46.720 --> 02:34:49.720]  governor of the state of Connecticut here why he was put in place because he
[02:34:49.720 --> 02:34:52.960]  obviously has the power to seal the Connecticut arrest at records in which
[02:34:52.960 --> 02:34:57.960]  his social was put out what was it I believe is Stratford in which the
[02:34:57.960 --> 02:35:02.400]  governor that is currently holding office Malloy was the financial board of
[02:35:02.400 --> 02:35:07.080]  advisors down there and which issued it back in 1980 now I'm just in here tying
[02:35:07.080 --> 02:35:10.920]  my own research together and understanding it hey back in the 80s we
[02:35:10.920 --> 02:35:14.720]  also had the Brinks robberies Brinks robberies two people that were tied to
[02:35:14.720 --> 02:35:18.680]  that are now in his administration if Ron Paul wants to really do something I
[02:35:18.680 --> 02:35:22.000]  mean the federal records right here I'm actually reading another app of David
[02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:25.640]  that was just put out two days ago there's gonna be a testimony hearing in
[02:35:25.640 --> 02:35:31.160]  trial in Hawaii it looks like January 18th I mean what why if Ron Paul really
[02:35:31.160 --> 02:35:35.600]  wants to to get this in action why isn't I guess my question is people are
[02:35:35.600 --> 02:35:41.680]  asking me why isn't he exposing I hear you Corey listen Ron Paul is on the
[02:35:41.680 --> 02:35:46.080]  economy on imminent war on the overturning the Bill of Rights and
[02:35:46.080 --> 02:35:51.960]  Constitution the system can block the release of all this stuff and the system
[02:35:51.960 --> 02:35:57.160]  can confuse the issue it's a soap opera that we've looked at some but that
[02:35:57.160 --> 02:36:02.160]  basically goes nowhere I mean I could have made a film about the birth
[02:36:02.160 --> 02:36:06.080]  certificate and sold 100,000 copies didn't do it I mean there's lots of hot
[02:36:06.080 --> 02:36:09.440]  button issues I could get into but I'm not here just to make money I'm here to
[02:36:09.440 --> 02:36:18.680]  get the work out money is just a tool to fund our operation and I mean to say
[02:36:18.680 --> 02:36:24.560]  Ron Paul do this Ron Paul do that his message has to be somewhat simple for
[02:36:24.560 --> 02:36:31.520]  this dump dumb down public and he's been doing that basic liberty basic freedom
[02:36:31.520 --> 02:36:37.600]  and we know he'll do the things he says he'll do he says the CIA deals drugs
[02:36:37.600 --> 02:36:40.840]  because they've been caught in that congressional hearings in a minute Ron
[02:36:40.840 --> 02:36:45.320]  Paul's exposed everything the problem is I take your call and then in the to
[02:36:45.320 --> 02:36:47.640]  answer your question would take 30 minutes to really go over all the
[02:36:47.640 --> 02:36:56.800]  different points but Ron Paul is facing an uphill battle but by fighting we get
[02:36:56.800 --> 02:37:01.840]  stronger politically and he could end up winning the system is that weak that
[02:37:01.840 --> 02:37:07.580]  discredited when they unload on him with every made up and twisted and spun
[02:37:07.580 --> 02:37:13.880]  and exaggerated thing if we don't act guilty and if he doesn't act guilty and
[02:37:13.880 --> 02:37:22.600]  apologetic he is going to absolutely explode like Rand Paul and Rand Paul
[02:37:22.600 --> 02:37:26.920]  came out was angry so this is pure bull and you know what it was the truth and
[02:37:26.920 --> 02:37:32.320]  so he stood the test of time and in Paul Ron Paul I'm gonna give him advice here
[02:37:32.320 --> 02:37:44.000]  he needs to do exactly what ran did and not apologize for anything and point out
[02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:49.320]  that it's all a bunch of baloney and say oh I'm the front runner now now you're
[02:37:49.320 --> 02:37:54.800]  trying to shoot me down now here's the deal that's one hurdle the second hurdle
[02:37:54.800 --> 02:38:03.040]  is Iowa after Iowa is New Hampshire in other areas he wins in Iowa so we can
[02:38:03.040 --> 02:38:07.920]  have from now and they're gonna two or three days before I'll just get to it
[02:38:07.920 --> 02:38:11.040]  in a minute because the problem is is that I don't want to just give out some
[02:38:11.040 --> 02:38:14.360]  convoluted thing the issue is they're gonna launch a bunch of attacks three or
[02:38:14.360 --> 02:38:20.440]  four days before Iowa on Ron Paul and it's gonna be he loves Iran and wants us
[02:38:20.440 --> 02:38:29.000]  to be nuked he goes on the Alex Jones radio show Ron Paul wrote racist news
[02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:36.080]  letters and on all of the issues especially the Alex Jones issue and
[02:38:36.080 --> 02:38:43.360]  that's where Ron Paul comes on here Ron Paul has to not apologize for it and he
[02:38:43.360 --> 02:38:47.200]  hasn't and that's good he can go on any radio show he wants he goes on shows all
[02:38:47.200 --> 02:38:52.680]  the time he doesn't 100% agree with see those of you that say oh my gosh Ron
[02:38:52.680 --> 02:38:57.520]  Paul won't win because of who he associates with he will win because of
[02:38:57.520 --> 02:39:02.120]  who he associates with if we stop taking on this self-fulfilling prophecy this
[02:39:02.120 --> 02:39:05.200]  mind game I mean might as well just be newt gendrickson and say whatever you
[02:39:05.200 --> 02:39:10.600]  want to hear and the truth is Ron Paul knows about false flag terror that's
[02:39:10.600 --> 02:39:16.840]  coming out in the newsletters he's a smart guy but you can't 100% prove 9
[02:39:16.840 --> 02:39:20.560]  11 one way or the other the official stories of fraud and we know from
[02:39:20.560 --> 02:39:24.560]  history and the evidence what happened but you can't a hundred percent nail
[02:39:24.560 --> 02:39:30.640]  down exactly X Y and Z happen and so you don't go there if you're Ron Paul
[02:39:30.640 --> 02:39:35.080]  same thing with the birth certificate yeah it's on record and the media never
[02:39:35.080 --> 02:39:39.480]  wants to touch this local media has covered it mainstream media that Obama
[02:39:39.480 --> 02:39:47.080]  had a fake social security number somebody else's
[02:39:48.960 --> 02:39:58.360]  yeah Obama is weird super creepy yeah the government of Kenya says they went
[02:39:58.360 --> 02:40:04.560]  in and destroyed the records turns out the Bush administration did a formal
[02:40:04.560 --> 02:40:14.400]  request during the campaign three and a half years ago four years ago they know
[02:40:14.400 --> 02:40:22.160]  Obama is blackmailed he's in there because they could destroy him anytime
[02:40:22.160 --> 02:40:28.840]  they want to and and and and Ron Paul is going up against that whole thing and
[02:40:28.840 --> 02:40:39.640]  he's surging in Iowa Romney's second the twit is third and the next thing they've
[02:40:39.640 --> 02:40:45.160]  got to go up against is in New Hampshire and other areas there's going to be
[02:40:45.160 --> 02:40:53.440]  fraud see I was a caucus with hands raised and everybody knows what their
[02:40:53.440 --> 02:40:57.080]  their little group was tallied at and then it's all added together so fraud is
[02:40:57.080 --> 02:41:02.680]  almost impossible but you know I hear this criticism of Vladimir Putin saying
[02:41:02.680 --> 02:41:05.720]  that you know if there was a fair election there he wouldn't win and that
[02:41:05.720 --> 02:41:11.800]  might be true the Russian government's is corrupt as the day is long but you
[02:41:11.800 --> 02:41:14.760]  don't think there's election fraud here so then I get the comment well then why
[02:41:14.760 --> 02:41:21.240]  even vote Alex because by going out and and and and running Ron Paul gets to
[02:41:21.240 --> 02:41:25.040]  educate people Ron Paul gets to point out what frauds the other candidates are
[02:41:25.040 --> 02:41:30.920]  and then when there is election fraud it gets illustrated and people get caught
[02:41:30.920 --> 02:41:36.080]  and people go to jail and people die and commit suicide before they can release
[02:41:36.080 --> 02:41:40.960]  all the die-bold information there's been murders there's been testimony in the
[02:41:40.960 --> 02:41:44.760]  Florida legislature of confirmed programmers hired to engage in fraud
[02:41:44.760 --> 02:41:49.640]  I've caught Travis County stealing the election went down to the certification
[02:41:49.640 --> 02:41:54.840]  and the state in the Austin American statesmen the state said well the
[02:41:54.840 --> 02:41:58.560]  Election Commission did find that there was all these problems and that this
[02:41:58.560 --> 02:42:03.120]  happened but we're still certifying it in the case of Karen Sunlightner for
[02:42:03.120 --> 02:42:08.360]  County Commissioner 2 a.m. she's losing her best friend the county clerk she
[02:42:08.360 --> 02:42:11.920]  runs to her crying collapses on her in the bathroom this is in the paper
[02:42:11.920 --> 02:42:16.680]  witnesses saw this and she comes out and says she won I went to bed that night
[02:42:16.680 --> 02:42:20.120]  midnight going on Karen Sunlightner's been defeated man do I hate her you know
[02:42:20.120 --> 02:42:25.240]  back in the day big globalist land grabber all this other stuff and woke up
[02:42:25.240 --> 02:42:29.760]  it's 7 a.m. the next morning and Karen Sunlightner won and I went and
[02:42:29.760 --> 02:42:33.240]  investigated I had a bunch of people down at the election where it was going on
[02:42:33.240 --> 02:42:36.720]  they said no the ballot show she lost big time we were talking to everybody as
[02:42:36.720 --> 02:42:41.000]  we stacked them up and stuck them in the machine I saw the same thing I saw
[02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:44.640]  Pat Buchanan I walked around talking to everybody at the main counting area is
[02:42:44.640 --> 02:42:47.400]  Pat Buchanan about two-thirds of these are like yeah he's about two-thirds I
[02:42:47.400 --> 02:42:50.440]  went over to other precinct but they're stacking them get them in the machine are
[02:42:50.440 --> 02:42:54.840]  you seeing Pat Buchanan I wanted to see it Pat Buchanan got 2% of the vote that
[02:42:54.840 --> 02:42:59.120]  year in the Republican primary in Austin folks he had two-thirds of the votes I
[02:42:59.120 --> 02:43:02.040]  saw the fraud I was going through every stack on let's just must be a
[02:43:02.040 --> 02:43:05.760]  conservative precinct hey what's going on in fact it was mainly Pat Buchanan
[02:43:05.760 --> 02:43:08.320]  people in there a bunch of us went down there and did it like what are you
[02:43:08.320 --> 02:43:11.200]  getting yeah it's Pat Buchanan look Pat Buchanan Pat Buchanan something's
[02:43:11.200 --> 02:43:14.560]  going on here yeah there's something going on because then you stick the scantrons
[02:43:14.560 --> 02:43:17.680]  in the machine and then it would count them up put them on a computer tape and
[02:43:17.680 --> 02:43:21.240]  Dan and Eddie Bois would walk you in the county clerk and go ah with the
[02:43:21.240 --> 02:43:29.560]  computer tape and go hmm I oversee the voting what was it Stalin said cast all
[02:43:29.560 --> 02:43:33.320]  the boats you want I count them so you're like well then why are we even
[02:43:33.320 --> 02:43:38.600]  running we've got to show people this we've got to fight and from talking to
[02:43:38.600 --> 02:43:43.600]  top voting fraud experts like Bev Harris and others a black box voting
[02:43:43.600 --> 02:43:50.480]  there on HBO when somebody's a landslide they can't cover it up because it
[02:43:50.480 --> 02:43:53.840]  becomes too obvious and it's too dangerous so they're gonna try to stop it
[02:43:53.840 --> 02:43:56.920]  from getting the nomination all right let's go back to your calls I've
[02:43:56.920 --> 02:44:00.120]  basically given you how they're gonna come after Ron Paul there but I want to
[02:44:00.120 --> 02:44:03.720]  a whole special 10-minute report on it tonight I know Watson's got an article
[02:44:03.720 --> 02:44:07.040]  that we're working on together coming out in the morning no one him I even come

[02:44:13.040 --> 02:44:15.720]  justice to it I got some other news I want to hit but right now let's go back
[02:44:15.720 --> 02:44:20.720]  to your calls I can pontificate can I Jason in California you're on the year

[02:44:29.080 --> 02:44:32.600]  gingers is a fraud man you know it's funny is I've been in sales for about four
[02:44:32.600 --> 02:44:36.680]  years now and you look at the way he answers his questions and the way he
[02:44:36.680 --> 02:44:42.640]  responds you know he does he's he's he's hit him he doesn't he doesn't shy away
[02:44:42.640 --> 02:44:46.600]  from him he goes right right he hit from head on and he just acts like it's not
[02:44:46.600 --> 02:44:50.440]  a big deal I mean you can tell the guy's a complete fake Ron Paul should ask him
[02:44:50.440 --> 02:44:53.960]  what advice did you get from me and Freddie Mac for the 1.8 million dollars
[02:44:53.960 --> 02:44:56.880]  that you got that's one thing that Ron Paul didn't do when he was when he was
[02:44:56.880 --> 02:45:00.640]  a nail him to the wall but a real quick story when it's like I live out here in
[02:45:00.640 --> 02:45:03.800]  California and when that when I found out from you when I was listening to your
[02:45:03.800 --> 02:45:08.600]  show I download to show my iPod that the NDA 8 bill is passed and I stopped the
[02:45:08.600 --> 02:45:12.920]  random gentleman on the street and I talked to him and told him and he knew
[02:45:12.920 --> 02:45:17.280]  about it and then I went over to 711 I was so vivid I was so living I want to
[02:45:17.280 --> 02:45:21.280]  have 711 and there was like 15 people in the 711 I'm like okay well what Alex
[02:45:21.280 --> 02:45:25.240]  Jones do in this situation and I'm like excuse me everybody and I stopped
[02:45:25.240 --> 02:45:28.520]  everyone in the store I says do you know the government just passed and I
[02:45:28.520 --> 02:45:32.120]  reiterate everything to him and I'm sitting there I'm like well what are these
[02:45:32.120 --> 02:45:34.880]  you know what are they gonna say you know there's a store for morons or what
[02:45:34.880 --> 02:45:38.880]  and like three people looking me like hey my dad was talking about that and we
[02:45:38.880 --> 02:45:42.920]  am suing this big discussion about what's going on and that's how that's
[02:45:42.920 --> 02:45:46.920]  how revolutions began the same thing in Romania and other areas you just
[02:45:46.920 --> 02:45:51.280]  realize none of us like this none of us want to go along with this and that's
[02:45:51.280 --> 02:45:55.320]  why the state wants to control industry and resources so they can hold back the
[02:45:55.320 --> 02:46:00.120]  resources and have the system so dependent on them and on social security
[02:46:00.120 --> 02:46:04.560]  and everything that they already stole that people go along with the system
[02:46:04.560 --> 02:46:08.440]  just because they don't know what to do without it that's why the system always
[02:46:08.440 --> 02:46:13.960]  makes you dependent Congress has a 9% approval rating Jason up that the
[02:46:13.960 --> 02:46:20.640]  public's awake they just don't know how bad it is if they knew I was on a big
[02:46:20.640 --> 02:46:23.760]  syndicated show this morning a couple of but I was on man cow not just on the
[02:46:23.760 --> 02:46:29.440]  European radio and he was like yeah what is this about fluoride the water and
[02:46:29.440 --> 02:46:32.120]  the cancer and everything and I was like well you know they had hundreds of
[02:46:32.120 --> 02:46:36.240]  chemicals including radioactive isotopes and man cow knows I don't make
[02:46:36.240 --> 02:46:39.600]  stuff up and so even off air during breaks is like really send me that I
[02:46:39.600 --> 02:46:42.600]  can't believe this you know my dad died of cancer early and all this stuff he's
[02:46:42.600 --> 02:46:46.920]  talked about that on air but I mean you tell people hey you know they put
[02:46:46.920 --> 02:46:53.000]  uranium in the water and people are like whoa yeah and you should take it
[02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:57.280]  personal I mean these are killers these are sick little cowardly control freaks
[02:46:57.280 --> 02:47:01.320]  doing this and people are like all that couldn't be true or it's it sounds so
[02:47:01.320 --> 02:47:06.800]  big so unbelievable but remember I've been hammering this for two or three
[02:47:06.800 --> 02:47:11.040]  years now and you just saw earlier this year in Texas news and then it was in
[02:47:11.040 --> 02:47:16.680]  Oklahoma and then Illinois I told you it's everywhere hey state employees just
[02:47:16.680 --> 02:47:20.680]  blew the whistle they were ordered by the feds to cover it up and headline Rick

[02:54:08.760 --> 02:54:13.120]  expanding regulatory power in name of sustainable development now it's not
[02:54:13.120 --> 02:54:16.400]  going to be global warming it's just we say what's sustainable we control
[02:54:16.400 --> 02:54:20.240]  everything the US Environmental Protection Agency wants to change how it
[02:54:20.240 --> 02:54:27.560]  analyzes problems and makes decisions it makes the decisions in a way that will
[02:54:27.560 --> 02:54:32.000]  give it vastly expanded power to regulate businesses communities and
[02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:37.640]  ecosystems in the name of sustainable development the centerpiece of the
[02:54:37.640 --> 02:54:44.320]  global United Nations conference slated for Rio de Janeiro next June that's what
[02:54:44.320 --> 02:54:48.240]  Lord Moncton said they're going for that but the EPA saying they may just do it
[02:54:48.240 --> 02:54:52.200]  before that even happens just the president launches wars without
[02:54:52.200 --> 02:54:57.400]  Congress Newt Gendron says his president he just started arresting people he
[02:54:57.400 --> 02:55:01.680]  didn't agree with that's in the news today the US Environmental Protection
[02:55:01.680 --> 02:55:05.840]  Agency wants to change how it analyzes problems makes decisions the major
[02:55:05.840 --> 02:55:13.240]  focus of the EPA thinking is a weighty study with agency commissioned last year
[02:55:13.240 --> 02:55:18.560]  from the National National Academies of Science published in August the study
[02:55:18.560 --> 02:55:23.840]  entitled sustainability in the US EPA cost nearly seven hundred thousand
[02:55:23.840 --> 02:55:28.080]  dollars oh I guess a panel of experts say of the global warming's real so we've
[02:55:28.080 --> 02:55:32.280]  got to give all our money to them and now the panel of experts says that the
[02:55:32.280 --> 02:55:36.440]  involvement of a team of dozen outside experts and about half as many national
[02:55:36.440 --> 02:55:41.720]  academic staff it's aimed how to integrate sustainability as one of the key
[02:55:41.720 --> 02:55:46.480]  drivers within the regulatory responsibility of the EPA the panel
[02:55:46.480 --> 02:55:51.680]  who wrote the study declares part of its job to be providing guidance to EPA on
[02:55:51.680 --> 02:55:56.200]  how it might implement its existing statutory authority to contribute more
[02:55:56.200 --> 02:56:00.920]  fully to a more sustainable development trajectory for the United States in
[02:56:00.920 --> 02:56:06.760]  other words how to use existing laws to new ends and I'm going to cover more of
[02:56:06.760 --> 02:56:14.720]  this tonight but very very creepy now I said I'd cover this today and I did
[02:56:14.720 --> 02:56:18.840]  cover a lot of it but Jaren thought to look at the new hit pieces and this is
[02:56:18.840 --> 02:56:22.880]  just what came out today since I was telling you at the start of the show
[02:56:22.880 --> 02:56:26.320]  that they're about to launch the attack now that he's the front runner and
[02:56:26.320 --> 02:56:31.000]  that's a no-brainer and how they're going to do it here it is Ron Paul
[02:56:31.000 --> 02:56:39.240]  conspiracy nut Chicago now here's news one Ron Paul supporter assassinate inward
[02:56:39.240 --> 02:56:43.080]  Obama and monkey children I told you they're going to play the right they're
[02:56:43.080 --> 02:56:46.600]  going to have their operatives are mentally ill people it's hard to believe
[02:56:46.600 --> 02:56:51.800]  they have operatives but they've been caught so there's that I knew that was
[02:56:51.800 --> 02:56:59.440]  going to come here's another one the Ron Paul double-standard another attack
[02:56:59.800 --> 02:57:05.520]  here's another one why doesn't the Tea Party love Ron Paul and then I have this
[02:57:05.520 --> 02:57:09.520]  other one out of the weekly standard that says the company Ron Paul keeps
[02:57:09.520 --> 02:57:13.600]  meet Alex Jones and they say Alex Jones and Ron Paul believe they're going to use
[02:57:13.600 --> 02:57:17.720]  the military on the streets of America it's completely insane and Alex says
[02:57:17.720 --> 02:57:23.440]  elite secretly meet yeah it's really crazy of course they don't mention that
[02:57:23.440 --> 02:57:26.640]  the film they talk about I show all the footage of it and the Bilderberg groups
[02:57:26.640 --> 02:57:31.200]  agenda and Jones says they want to live forever it's really crazy I just show
[02:57:31.200 --> 02:57:34.720]  all their quotes about how they believe they're going to find life extension
[02:57:34.720 --> 02:57:38.360]  technologies and how the general public can't be given it I mean I'm giving you
[02:57:38.360 --> 02:57:44.400]  a criminal breakdown an analysis of these criminals minds a report so we know
[02:57:44.400 --> 02:57:50.240]  the enemy off their quotes and they know that but they make it sound crazy so
[02:57:50.240 --> 02:57:55.840]  it's on we got to dig up the articles where the Rand Paul attackers were
[02:57:55.840 --> 02:57:59.320]  people dressing up and acting like they were supporters and you're gonna see
[02:57:59.320 --> 02:58:06.360]  all of it oh well what do you say about your supporter who says black people are
[02:58:06.360 --> 02:58:11.760]  are this or that I mean how do you respond to that it's like saying why do
[02:58:11.760 --> 02:58:16.400]  you beat your wife or why'd you kill your wife Ron Paul tell us do you worship
[02:58:16.400 --> 02:58:22.480]  the Aqua Buddha as you kidnap women you're not a medical doctor either just
[02:58:22.480 --> 02:58:27.400]  totally made up so remember the crooks that run this country we're gonna come
[02:58:27.400 --> 02:58:35.040]  after Ron Paul and do some overdrive and at least get to Angie and Jim Jim's
[02:58:35.040 --> 02:58:39.480]  first he disagrees and then others stay with us I'll be back tonight 7 o'clock

[02:59:02.480 --> 02:59:06.080]  will be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've turned in
[02:59:06.080 --> 02:59:10.640]  this influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling
[02:59:10.640 --> 02:59:15.920]  the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[02:59:15.920 --> 02:59:20.480]  attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[02:59:20.480 --> 02:59:25.120]  offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes

[02:59:29.160 --> 02:59:32.840]  asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to

[02:59:57.840 --> 03:00:03.240]  Broadcasting Network network
[03:00:03.240 --> 03:00:14.000]  oh by the way hackers have threatened to disrupt the Iowa caucus and so the feds
[03:00:14.000 --> 03:00:18.520]  are gonna have to come in and oversee it all to make sure there's no fraud because
[03:00:18.520 --> 03:00:27.320]  they protect you from the hackers let's go ahead and talk to the guy that

[03:00:32.840 --> 03:00:38.120]  Carolina you're on the air hi Alex I have two important points I want to make
[03:00:38.120 --> 03:00:43.600]  and a quick question I'm not sure if you've actually bought it up I've heard
[03:00:43.600 --> 03:00:50.040]  you talking about torture and whatnot but I don't think people in general are
[03:00:50.040 --> 03:00:56.560]  familiar with the fact that there are secret provisions to 1857 particularly
[03:00:56.560 --> 03:01:01.160]  secret torture provisions and there was a debate on the house floor Lindsey Graham
[03:01:01.160 --> 03:01:07.240]  and Joe Lieberman of course were cheerleading for keeping these secret
[03:01:07.240 --> 03:01:11.720]  torture provisions classified they didn't want them unclassified and you're

[03:02:30.480 --> 03:02:33.240]  confused about what Lindsey Graham is saying he's saying you know for the
[03:02:33.240 --> 03:02:38.520]  first time we have a bill before us that would exclude Americans from being
[03:02:38.520 --> 03:02:43.760]  included in this what he's doing is he's actually arguing against the provision
[03:02:43.760 --> 03:02:48.800]  the amendment that would have excluded Americans from being involved in this
[03:02:48.800 --> 03:02:53.800]  he's saying no if you are homegrown terrorists or their definition of that
[03:02:53.800 --> 03:02:56.800]  which we know they've no no he's incredibly deceptive well then I have
