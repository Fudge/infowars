[00:00.000 --> 00:26.400]  Wow, we have got a lot to report to you on this worldwide broadcast, thank you for joining
[00:26.400 --> 00:31.920]  us on the 29th day of April 2018 for the Sunday Transmission. We'll be here as we are every Sunday
[00:31.920 --> 00:36.880]  live four to six p.m. ahead of the weekday broadcasts of myself, Owen Schreuer, David Knight,
[00:36.880 --> 00:42.080]  and others. Ten hours a day live now from the M. Full Wars Network that the establishment is trying
[00:42.080 --> 00:49.280]  to take down. Well, Mr. Clapper, former national director of intelligence who also headed up the
[00:49.280 --> 00:59.680]  NSA previous to that testified to Congress four years ago that he had never and the NSA had never
[00:59.680 --> 01:06.000]  spied on anyone in the United States period. Now that was a 1000% total complete lie.
[01:07.200 --> 01:13.200]  The statute of limitations just expired on perjuring yourself to Congress. It's actually
[01:13.200 --> 01:19.920]  five years. I said four. It's been five years. He did it again. He testified to Congress. There's
[01:19.920 --> 01:24.960]  an excellent zero hedge article up on infowars.com, but also even the Hill and others have picked it
[01:24.960 --> 01:30.480]  up. Jack Mesobic did a great breakdown. We should get Jack home the next few days of this whole
[01:30.480 --> 01:38.560]  situation, but he testified that he was never the source. We even have a Don Lemon video that's in
[01:38.560 --> 01:42.240]  the folder. I forgot to tell you guys about it. It's like two minutes long or even Don Lemon
[01:42.240 --> 01:48.160]  grills him and goes, but you are the source. You told CNN you were the source. Now he works for CNN.
[01:49.360 --> 01:53.040]  So when Don Lemon saying you're a liar, I mean, that's like Pinocchio saying you're a liar. I mean,
[01:53.040 --> 01:59.440]  you got a serious problem when Pinocchio even thinks you're bad. The arrogant Pinocchio that is
[01:59.440 --> 02:05.760]  Don Lemon because CNN knows he's the source. He's bragged he was the source back when he was so
[02:05.760 --> 02:12.800]  arrogant back when his counterpart of the CIA, Brennan, was saying stuff like, watch your mouth.
[02:14.720 --> 02:19.120]  So Trump has ripped the lying machine James Clapper over leaks to CNN.
[02:20.800 --> 02:28.000]  And the articles on infowars, both from infowars and zero hedge, just chronicle video clips of him
[02:28.000 --> 02:38.320]  in 2017 on CNN. Right as the president's being inaugurated saying, you know, that he saw the
[02:38.320 --> 02:42.480]  info, he leaked the info. Then we've got him testifying to Congress. Months later, he didn't.
[02:42.480 --> 02:47.200]  It's like these people have Alzheimer's or something, or they don't think we're paying
[02:47.200 --> 02:54.400]  attention. Well, we are Clapper and Brennan and all the rest of you. So those clips are coming up
[02:54.400 --> 03:00.000]  later in the hour. But sometimes something happens that really illustrates everything.
[03:01.440 --> 03:08.240]  And a big thing that we have to really dig into today is the whole situation with the
[03:08.240 --> 03:15.360]  White House Correspondents Dinner that transpired over the weekend and the abject insane asylum
[03:15.360 --> 03:22.800]  level arrogance that even has mainstream media saying this completely flopped. But it gets better
[03:22.800 --> 03:32.240]  later. Coming up, CNN was given an award at the press dinner for the Steele dossier reporting,
[03:33.440 --> 03:38.400]  which was illegal leaks and fake and been proven to be a fraud. And they think you're so dumb.
[03:38.400 --> 03:45.040]  You think is that arrogance? No. They think like Gruber said, we bet everything on the public having
[03:45.040 --> 03:58.320]  no memory. We bet everything on the public having absolutely totally no memory. So we're going to
[03:58.320 --> 04:04.640]  be going over all of that because I mean, here they are giving an award to three so-called
[04:04.640 --> 04:17.040]  reporters, Jake Tapper and others at CNN at the press dinner in the middle of the scandal of Clapper
[04:17.040 --> 04:24.800]  perjuring himself to Congress in front of the whole world. If you like, if I said I robbed a bank
[04:26.080 --> 04:32.640]  on January 3rd and then a couple of months later on April 3rd, I testified to Congress
[04:32.640 --> 04:37.760]  that the clappers case was actually April 10th. I never did that ever. That's that's insane.
[04:41.280 --> 04:47.360]  Just like we got to queue it up where he said five years ago, I've never, no one in the NSA
[04:47.360 --> 04:52.960]  has ever spied on anybody in the US ever. It just doesn't happen. So we're going to come back from
[04:52.960 --> 05:02.240]  break with Ms. Wolf roasting herself hoisted on her own petard. Introducing Cell Force by Info
[05:02.240 --> 05:08.640]  Wars Life. Cell Force focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection. Mitochondria produce
[05:08.640 --> 05:14.720]  over 95 percent of your energy. They are your body's cellular engines. Cell Force helps promote
[05:14.720 --> 05:20.480]  your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria, much like a cellular engine overhaul
[05:20.480 --> 05:25.360]  because when your mitochondria don't run at 100 percent efficiency, then they start producing
[05:25.360 --> 05:32.240]  reactive oxygen species. Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage
[05:32.240 --> 05:38.240]  resulting from these reactive oxygen species. The antioxidants found in Cell Force are some
[05:38.240 --> 05:43.040]  of the most powerful available on the market. The stronger the antioxidant, the better its
[05:43.040 --> 05:49.680]  ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals. Boost, protect,
[05:49.680 --> 05:59.440]  and adapt with Cell Force from Info Wars Life. Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[05:59.440 --> 06:25.600]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance. It's Alex
[06:25.600 --> 06:42.320]  Jones. Well, we rarely see mainstream media fall on its face in a more disgusting fashion.
[06:42.320 --> 06:46.720]  They do it all the time, but this was really special. We've got quite a few of the excerpts
[06:46.720 --> 06:55.280]  coming up this hour of Michelle Wolfe of Viacom and Sumner Redstone anti-American fame. Same folks
[06:55.280 --> 07:01.520]  that brought you gangster rap and MTV. Well, they're not busy undermining the president.
[07:01.520 --> 07:06.400]  They're busy throwing fits that for the second year in a row, he didn't show up to a correspondence
[07:06.400 --> 07:13.760]  dinner. When these are people sworn to destroy him, who absolutely hate him, who are talentless,
[07:13.760 --> 07:20.400]  that no one wants to watch, that has almost zero ratings, doesn't even show up, and if he shows up,
[07:20.400 --> 07:26.000]  then they get ratings. Why would you show up to have a bunch of feckless, craven,
[07:28.160 --> 07:37.680]  unpopular losers, cowardly individuals tell stupid jokes? The really sick one. A week and a half after
[07:37.680 --> 07:45.360]  a Southwest Airlines engine blew up, blew a hole in the side of the fuselage and sucked the woman
[07:45.360 --> 07:49.760]  halfway out, almost cutting her head off before they drug her back in. She died hours later at
[07:49.760 --> 07:57.120]  the hospital. That's not funny. They say he's like a big orange Southwest engine blowing up.
[07:57.120 --> 08:05.600]  Hollywood, MTV, Comedy Central, all these shows, Stephen Colbert,
[08:06.960 --> 08:12.880]  they are in their own bizarre, hateful echo chambers. Can you imagine if I made a joke
[08:13.920 --> 08:17.600]  about an engine blowing up and killing a woman and injuring other people
[08:20.160 --> 08:23.920]  and concerned it would say Hillary Clinton, you would never hear the end of it. Instead,
[08:23.920 --> 08:28.480]  they make up things I never said or edit things I said to demonize me, but these people
[08:29.440 --> 08:34.480]  are the hateful ones. And they're the ones that funded the Arab Spring that killed over a million
[08:34.480 --> 08:41.120]  people, over 100,000 of them women and children, many of which were sold into sex slavery, the ones
[08:41.120 --> 08:48.080]  that were unlucky enough to not be killed. And I mean that seriously. Sold into slavery that
[08:48.080 --> 08:54.400]  Islam still has operating in six countries, six of the seven Trump banned from coming to the United
[08:54.400 --> 09:00.640]  States unvetted. We don't accept their fake passports and the Supreme Court set next week.
[09:01.200 --> 09:05.200]  The word is to affirm the president. So we'll see how they like that. So that's coming up.
[09:06.080 --> 09:12.240]  Tying into the press dinner, they gave CNN an award for reporting on the Piscay dossier,
[09:12.240 --> 09:17.120]  the Steele dossier, PP gate, which is admittedly totally fake. They admitted it's fake,
[09:17.120 --> 09:24.320]  but they gave themselves an award thinking you're so stupid, you won't remember that they now admit
[09:24.320 --> 09:30.240]  it's fake. Not just that Congress found there was no evidence. Even mainstream news has to admit
[09:30.240 --> 09:36.000]  there's no evidence any of the Steele dossiers real, but they don't care. They don't care they've
[09:36.000 --> 09:40.960]  lost all these lawsuits and the rest of it. They just keep rehashing and retreading the same thing
[09:40.960 --> 09:49.920]  over and over again. They had Comey on this week on CNN saying he doesn't know if the PP gate
[09:49.920 --> 09:53.840]  thing isn't true or not. He says he never saw it. There's no evidence of it, but who knows it might
[09:53.840 --> 09:58.880]  be true. It might be true that monkeys, flying monkeys fly out of his rear end as well. I'm
[09:58.880 --> 10:04.480]  trying to get gross here. It's just this stuff is pure absolute bull. We know Hillary was on the
[10:04.480 --> 10:09.360]  Chinese payroll, the Russian payroll. We know their servers went missing. It goes on and on.
[10:09.360 --> 10:15.360]  And so when people always bring up the FBI investigation and the Clinton Justice Department
[10:15.360 --> 10:20.800]  people and all of it, the big issue here is, where's the prosecution of them when it's open
[10:20.800 --> 10:29.120]  and shut? But enough of that. Let's go to some of the most unfunny, sickening macabre stumbling.
[10:29.680 --> 10:38.240]  This comedy central witch who's getting her own show on Netflix, got half a eaten hamburger and a
[10:38.240 --> 10:45.280]  garbage pile can get a show on Netflix now. Netflix is giving this witch a show and I'm
[10:45.280 --> 10:50.560]  sure if it gets zero stars, like some of the other folks have gotten, I'm sure they'll just ban
[10:50.560 --> 10:55.760]  the ratings system for that particular video. But here she is making sick jokes and so pissed
[10:56.320 --> 10:59.840]  that we're turning the country around from the brink of death. Here it is.
[10:59.840 --> 11:11.440]  You are hosting the White House Correspondents Dinner, which is a big event for those who don't
[11:11.440 --> 11:16.800]  know. Typically the president will be there. This president has decided to sit this last one out.
[11:16.800 --> 11:22.640]  And I think he's, is he not coming to this event? No, he's not coming. I get the lovely Sarah Huckabee
[11:22.640 --> 11:28.960]  Sanders instead. Yeah. By the way, hit pause. There's this ironic thing on Vice TV,
[11:28.960 --> 11:34.320]  in Comedy Central, where they get women and men that kind of don't look right and who can't really
[11:34.320 --> 11:39.760]  talk. It's supposed to be real ironic. Like we pay attention because we think they're kind of special.
[11:39.760 --> 11:47.600]  Let's go back to her. Michelle Wolf, now known as the 2018 Correspondents Dinner Liberal,
[11:47.600 --> 11:53.040]  failed with snappy one liners that went absolutely nowhere. I'm going to skip it a lot of the normal
[11:53.040 --> 12:00.240]  pleasantries. We're at a Hilton. It's not nice. This is on C-span. No one watches that. Trump is
[12:00.240 --> 12:06.960]  president. It's not ideal. White House Correspondents Fine Association, thank you for having me. The
[12:06.960 --> 12:15.360]  monkfish was fine. A shrill, ridiculing, shallow voice, belting out insults catered to the nihilistic
[12:15.360 --> 12:20.960]  mind of the far left. I never really thought I'd be a comedian, but I did take an aptitude test
[12:20.960 --> 12:26.000]  in seventh grade, and this is a hundred percent true. I took an aptitude test in seventh grade,
[12:26.000 --> 12:32.320]  and it said my best profession was a clown or a mine. Well, I first said clown, and then I heard
[12:32.320 --> 12:37.920]  my voice and was like, or maybe mine. It is kind of crazy that the Trump campaign was in contact
[12:37.920 --> 12:45.600]  with Russia when the Hillary campaign wasn't even in contact with Michigan. It's a direct
[12:45.600 --> 12:53.760]  way. It's so close. Trump is racist, though. He loves white nationalists, which is a weird term
[12:53.760 --> 13:00.320]  for a Nazi. Calling a Nazi a white nationalist is like calling a pedophile a kid friend,
[13:02.080 --> 13:08.720]  or Harvey Weinstein a ladies man. And I'm never really sure what to call Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
[13:08.720 --> 13:14.480]  You know, is it Sarah Sanders? Is it Sarah Huckabee Sanders? Is it cousin Huckabee?
[13:14.480 --> 13:20.720]  Is it Auntie Huckabee Sanders? Like, what's Uncle Tom but for white women who disappoint other white
[13:20.720 --> 13:29.360]  women? Oh, I know, Aunt Coulter. I did have a lot of jokes. I had a lot of jokes about cabinet
[13:29.360 --> 13:35.680]  members, but I had to scrap all of those because everyone has been fired. You guys are going through
[13:35.680 --> 13:42.240]  cabinet members quicker than Starbucks throws out black people. No, don't worry. They're having an
[13:42.240 --> 13:52.080]  afternoon. We just needed an afternoon. Wolf Council influences as Seth Meyers and Trevor Noah.
[13:52.080 --> 13:56.400]  No wonder her performance was so lame. I am also honored to be performing for those of you here
[13:56.400 --> 14:04.160]  tonight, as well as the handful of people watching at home on C-Span. Relying on tasteless shock
[14:04.160 --> 14:14.400]  humor and vulgarity. Trump is so broke. Southwest used him as one of their engines. I know. It's
[14:14.400 --> 14:21.280]  so soon. It's so soon for that joke. Why did she tell it? If this is what funny is to the mainstream
[14:21.280 --> 14:27.040]  media, can you blame most Americans for their overwhelming distrust? Past correspondence
[14:27.040 --> 14:32.240]  dinner performers actually brought jokes. I have an announcement for those of you watching tonight's
[14:32.240 --> 14:42.000]  event live on C-Span. For God's sake, it's Saturday night. It is good to be on C-Span.
[14:42.000 --> 14:50.800]  I'm glad I'm not on your rival network. No input. HDMI one. But Wolf is the poster child
[14:50.800 --> 14:56.080]  for all of the attempted comedy shoved down America's throats these days. Hate-fueled
[14:56.080 --> 15:02.560]  diatribes by hacks who aren't even worthy to carry Richard Pryor or George Carlin's water
[15:02.560 --> 15:10.400]  to the stage. John Bowne reporting for inforce.com. By the way, I used to watch Stephen Colbert and
[15:10.400 --> 15:15.920]  the Daily Show and back when he was just one of the fake reporters on there. And it was entertaining
[15:15.920 --> 15:20.320]  because the stuff he was saying about Bush most of the time was true. Bush had a lot of big problems.
[15:20.320 --> 15:28.240]  But now with Trump, it's made up or it's the same old hate. It's not funny. And I try to find good
[15:28.240 --> 15:40.240]  comedy. It's not funny. I mean, remember Richard Pryor, remember George Carlin, remember any of
[15:40.240 --> 15:46.960]  those comics, Bill Hicks or Sam Kenneson or Rodney Dangerville, they were funny. They were
[15:46.960 --> 15:52.080]  political sometimes too, but they're just not funny anymore because corporate hacks put on a
[15:52.080 --> 15:55.840]  teleprompter what they're supposed to read. They're henchmen. They're not even comedians.
[15:55.840 --> 16:02.560]  They're puppets. We'll be back. Stay with us. I want to plow into all of this. I'm going to spend a
[16:02.560 --> 16:09.600]  few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or
[16:09.600 --> 16:17.520]  water filtration systems or books or videos or other material from infowarstore.com, you are

[16:54.400 --> 16:56.400]  And they're coming back against us, so we need your support.

[19:40.640 --> 19:47.120]  Absolutely. Because then we could all as educated patriots help our other countrymen and women
[19:47.120 --> 19:51.920]  understand that there's a bigger problems going on. And if we can get our houses in order
[19:51.920 --> 19:54.720]  and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[20:03.280 --> 20:05.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:05.920 --> 20:17.920]  It's never going to get any better. Don't look for it. Be happy with what you got.
[20:19.040 --> 20:24.640]  Because the owners of this country don't want that. I'm talking about the real owners now.
[20:24.640 --> 20:29.840]  The real owners, the big wealthy business and just to control things and make all the important
[20:29.840 --> 20:34.640]  decisions. Forget the politicians. The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have
[20:34.640 --> 20:44.560]  freedom of choice. You don't. You have no choice. You have owners. They own you. They own everything.
[20:44.560 --> 20:49.040]  They own all the important land. They own and control the corporations. They've long since
[20:49.040 --> 20:52.320]  bought and paid for the senate, the congress, the state houses and city halls. They got the
[20:52.320 --> 20:56.800]  judges in their back pockets and they own all the big media companies so they control just about
[20:56.800 --> 21:03.520]  all the news and information you get to hear. They got you by the balls. They want obedient
[21:03.520 --> 21:09.600]  workers. Obedient workers. People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork
[21:09.600 --> 21:14.560]  and just dumb enough to passively accept jobs with a lower pay, the longer hours to reduce
[21:14.560 --> 21:18.640]  benefits, the end of overtime and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to
[21:18.640 --> 21:23.840]  collect it. And now they're coming for your social security money so they can give it to their
[21:23.840 --> 21:31.440]  criminal friends on Wall Street. It's a big club and you ain't in it. And you said recently quote,
[21:31.440 --> 21:36.880]  when you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do. You better believe it. So what
[21:36.880 --> 21:42.160]  specifically did they do? If I ask them, if I need them, you know most of the people on this stage
[21:42.160 --> 21:48.560]  I've given to just so you understand. A lot of money. You and I are not in the big club. The
[21:48.560 --> 21:54.160]  owners of this country know the truth. It's called the American dream because you have to be asleep
[21:54.160 --> 22:00.240]  to believe it. But I'll tell you what they don't want. They don't want a population of citizens
[22:00.240 --> 22:04.640]  capable of critical thinking. They don't want well informed, well educated people capable
[22:04.640 --> 22:08.960]  of critical thinking. They're not interested in that. That doesn't help them. That's against their
[22:08.960 --> 22:15.520]  interest. That's right. From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[22:19.520 --> 22:24.080]  If you just joined us, I played that George Carlin intro we've had for like three years,
[22:24.080 --> 22:28.880]  two and a half years from back during the middle of the first debates back when there was like
[22:28.880 --> 22:35.200]  11 Republican candidates with Trump because that's a real comedian that can bring in social issues
[22:35.760 --> 22:41.120]  from a populist perspective, not left to right. We interviewed George Carlin, one of my reporters
[22:41.120 --> 22:46.160]  before he died and he was really on target and had a lot of courage.
[22:48.560 --> 22:54.160]  That goes without saying, but you juxtapose that with Michelle Wolfe of Kami Central.
[22:54.160 --> 22:59.440]  They could jokes about the woman that died getting sucked out the window we can have
[22:59.440 --> 23:05.920]  a go saying I was a big orange engine like Trump killed her. It's not about Trump. You don't make
[23:05.920 --> 23:11.680]  fun of a woman that just died. It's super untasteful. I'm going to get to that in a minute and then
[23:11.680 --> 23:19.520]  to the big news, but Trump comes from the outside of the billionaire circles. He made his money
[23:19.520 --> 23:25.600]  in operations, not with the globalist combines. At the highest levels, Microsoft, Facebook,
[23:25.600 --> 23:36.960]  Twitter, Google, Amazon, Apple, IBM, General Electric, and the list goes on. The top fortune 30
[23:36.960 --> 23:45.040]  or so of the fortune 100 are 100% technocrats in their own words. Look it up. Davos leaders call
[23:45.040 --> 23:49.440]  themselves technocrats, call for the end of elections, call for appointing leaders of governments.
[23:50.320 --> 23:54.960]  Jeff Bezos, though, how do you make his money? He made 12 billion in one day last week.
[23:56.400 --> 24:03.440]  He's worth 140 billion now. Now there is Bloomberg. Jeff Bezos boost fortune by 12 billion in a day.
[24:05.600 --> 24:10.400]  Now I'm all for free market. He didn't make his money that way. He's a monopoly man.
[24:10.400 --> 24:17.920]  He needs to be broken up and he will be broken up. Once a monopoly starts surging like a cancer
[24:17.920 --> 24:23.280]  like this because of inside deals and government, it'll displace everything. That's why he's buying
[24:23.280 --> 24:29.920]  up. I was reading he's buying over a hundred stories of high rises a day. Did you hear what I
[24:29.920 --> 24:36.480]  just said? He's building and buying 100 stories a day just in high rises. That's in another
[24:36.480 --> 24:47.840]  Bloomberg article I saw last week, 100 stories a day. And he is the number one funder after George
[24:47.840 --> 24:53.760]  Soros of the Democratic Party. We know for a fact and we've got the intel coming out very soon
[24:53.760 --> 24:58.800]  that he's financing lawsuits against us and Trump right along with Soros and others. He's
[24:58.800 --> 25:03.200]  tried to hide this until now. He owns the Washington Post, a weapon against this country.
[25:03.200 --> 25:10.080]  He gets $1.50, it was $1.48 on every package USPS ships for him. That's over 70% of his packages.
[25:11.920 --> 25:16.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, the man is a cancer and I went down to Whole Foods today,
[25:16.240 --> 25:19.760]  the headquarters. He's bought Whole Foods, Amazon. It's now Amazon Foods. They admit
[25:19.760 --> 25:23.920]  they're not organic. Most of their stuff now. It's terrible. Very polite, got thrown out.
[25:23.920 --> 25:27.840]  Security guard was very nice. Most people were fans there. I thought more would be, you know,
[25:27.840 --> 25:33.280]  deranged liberals, but they were mainline liberals, smart liberals. And nice security guard says,
[25:33.280 --> 25:37.360]  hey, we're asking to leave. I said, absolutely, I leave. We're on the very end of the corner.
[25:38.080 --> 25:41.840]  No one's even around. Other guys come over and threaten us. If we don't leave, I said,
[25:41.840 --> 25:45.680]  I am leaving, but I get my car. Can I get my car? Wouldn't say. So I got back on their face.
[25:45.680 --> 25:50.880]  We're gonna go back with HD cameras this week. We're gonna go back with HD cameras and I'm
[25:50.880 --> 26:02.560]  gonna bullhorn the whole place. So that's all coming up. And I just thought of doing it this
[26:02.560 --> 26:08.000]  morning. I've been thinking about it for a long time, but I love my wife. I don't tell her what
[26:08.000 --> 26:11.920]  to do on a lot of things, but I said, listen, I don't want to see Amazon packages here anymore.
[26:12.480 --> 26:16.880]  We're not going to Whole Foods anymore. They're overpriced anyways by the exact same stuff for
[26:16.880 --> 26:22.080]  less at other stuff, places that are too expensive, like the HEB, you know, version of Whole Foods,
[26:22.640 --> 26:28.960]  Central Market. I said, we're not doing it. And she never goes there anymore. That's good. But
[26:29.600 --> 26:34.960]  I still like dog droppings or something at my house, man. I get home and there's an Amazon box,
[26:34.960 --> 26:39.520]  like a devil sitting there in my house. And I know she's gotten better about ordering different
[26:39.520 --> 26:45.120]  places. She goes, oh, it's so quick. It's less money because it's all subsidized. And the last straw
[26:45.120 --> 26:48.560]  was I love her to death. She's great. She only orders from every few weeks, you know, not every day
[26:48.560 --> 26:52.000]  something coming in. She's sort of food from there, everything. She would order things go,
[26:52.000 --> 26:56.400]  yeah, the shampoos all doesn't work right. I said, yeah, they buy rejected crap, Amazon's bad news.
[26:57.680 --> 26:58.480]  And I'm sitting there.
[27:02.640 --> 27:06.800]  And I'm just thinking about all the things Amazon's done and the thousands of companies it owns,
[27:06.800 --> 27:11.600]  hundreds of big ones, they own like 20 of the Fortune 100. And I showed her this morning,
[27:11.600 --> 27:19.920]  I said, look, and I typed in Alex Jones, Washington Post, snake oil. And she was looking at like
[27:19.920 --> 27:24.240]  six articles saying I'm a snake old salesman. I'm a fraud by the Washington Post. And I said,
[27:24.240 --> 27:28.720]  sweetheart, he owns the Washington Post. He's the biggest supplement owner in the country.
[27:29.360 --> 27:34.080]  I went and got more than a dozen products off our shelf that are private labeled high quality
[27:34.080 --> 27:38.560]  that they also private label it Whole Foods. And I said, sweetheart, they sell this for 30 at Whole
[27:38.560 --> 27:42.960]  Foods. It's the same bottle, same thing, different label we sell for 95. I said, you understand,
[27:42.960 --> 27:47.840]  he is a guy that made 12 billion in one day last week, another 5 billion the other days.
[27:48.800 --> 27:53.840]  He's tried to put us out of business. He's hired a bunch of former CIA people. This is in the news
[27:53.840 --> 27:58.720]  to run the Washington Post to try to destroy the country. They're quarterbacking operations against
[27:58.720 --> 28:05.120]  our family. And they're quarterbacking it against the entire country. And I said, I don't want to see
[28:05.120 --> 28:09.280]  another Amazon package here ever again. She goes, no, I get it. I understand. I didn't know it was
[28:09.280 --> 28:17.520]  that bad. I thought you shouldn't like him. I said, no. The man is a psychotic. He is out to get the
[28:17.520 --> 28:21.680]  president and the country. He wants you poor. He is so competitive. Reportedly, he will throw
[28:21.680 --> 28:27.200]  incredible fits over a penny. He bought the Washington Post and cut their pay and cut
[28:27.200 --> 28:32.160]  to everything. And the liberals still worship it like women under a pimp. He is he owns the
[28:32.160 --> 28:36.640]  biggest sweatshops in the U.S. He's buying all these big buildings and building them with 250
[28:36.640 --> 28:43.040]  square foot apartments in them. And then people pay even more than they pay for 1000 square foot
[28:43.040 --> 28:46.640]  and live in them. And he's getting it zoned where they can't build new apartments that are bigger
[28:46.640 --> 28:53.120]  to make you live like a slave under him when he lives in a 50,000 square foot house. He's a monster.
[28:53.120 --> 28:56.880]  He's a scumbag. He's an anti-American globalist enemy.
[28:56.880 --> 29:03.840]  I'm not a rocket scientist, but I know to go out and check the top side and see what they say.
[29:04.560 --> 29:08.080]  And they have talked about for decades that a lot of the mental disorders,
[29:09.200 --> 29:14.560]  a lot of the behavioral disorders, a lot of the autism spectrum disorders are in the gut
[29:15.360 --> 29:19.360]  from the diets and vaccines that trigger autoimmune responses in the stomach
[29:20.640 --> 29:24.880]  that then create major toxicity in the gut causing toxicity in the brain. Here's a big
[29:24.880 --> 29:30.800]  BBC report today. Cow bacteria are changing your mood. If you have the wrong ones, you're depressed.
[29:30.800 --> 29:35.440]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, it's been sold out for months. Myco ZX is back. Anti-fungal,

[29:40.160 --> 29:44.480]  colonize it and put a slime wall in. But the nutrients go through. They get what they want
[29:44.480 --> 29:49.360]  first. They colonize you. Then they secrete toxins in you that cause depression. They can even
[29:49.360 --> 29:55.280]  secrete toxins when they want more sugar. This is well known. Newcombe with Myco ZX, exclusively

[30:56.880 --> 31:02.560]  of the Second American Revolution. We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it
[31:02.560 --> 31:08.320]  together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave
[31:08.320 --> 31:13.520]  us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body. That's why I'm introducing ZShield, Toxic Metal
[31:13.520 --> 31:19.600]  and Chemical Defense Support. It's made in the USA. It's filled with known compounds from nature
[31:19.600 --> 31:24.240]  that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the InfoWars. It is a
[31:24.240 --> 31:29.440]  classical 360 win. This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year.
[31:29.440 --> 31:34.480]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as
[31:34.480 --> 31:38.320]  you can possibly get. You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to
[31:38.320 --> 31:43.440]  the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as
[31:43.440 --> 31:49.600]  focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires
[31:49.600 --> 31:53.600]  the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be. Thanks to your support and your
[31:53.600 --> 31:57.920]  prayers together, we're changing the world. Now it's time to change our bodies with ZShield

[32:59.280 --> 33:23.280]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[33:29.440 --> 33:40.480]  Now, if you want to see arrogance, you want to see hypocrisy,
[33:41.920 --> 33:47.280]  few examples are better than, again, the White House Correspondents' Dinner 2018.
[33:48.080 --> 33:54.400]  Trump has been roundly criticized by dinosaur and kleptocrat, decepticon, slime ball,
[33:54.400 --> 34:06.240]  prostitute, disinformation, coastal elites, media for not going to the Correspondents' Dinner,
[34:06.800 --> 34:12.160]  which was good-natured until just a few years ago, and vicious and deceptive, the very same group
[34:13.040 --> 34:18.320]  of Jim Acosta types that say that Trump didn't really visit Congressman Scalise in the hospital,
[34:18.320 --> 34:24.720]  even though there was live video of it, or that they'd removed Martin Luther King's bust from the
[34:24.720 --> 34:32.480]  Oval Office. All of it lies. But Jake Tapper and all the rest of them, hoping that you don't pay
[34:32.480 --> 34:39.120]  attention. So if it couldn't get any more sickening, Jake Tapper got caught hosting fake town halls
[34:39.120 --> 34:45.200]  in the aftermath of the shootings in Florida back in February. I never said the shootings
[34:45.200 --> 34:50.080]  didn't happen. I said they had fake town halls. I said that they got four scripted students who
[34:50.080 --> 34:54.480]  had talking points for the Democrats to be the voice of the anti-gun movement instead of the
[34:54.480 --> 35:02.480]  pro-gun students. This is all true. So you just build a straw man and demonize good old Alex Jones,
[35:02.480 --> 35:07.200]  and then you can set the pressure to demonize the next patriot. Just like they said Trump's a loser,
[35:07.200 --> 35:11.440]  Trump's a liar, Trump's going to prison, Trump's a criminal, everybody hates Trump,
[35:11.440 --> 35:15.760]  Trump doesn't have ratings, Trump's going to lose the election, Trump's a racist, Trump's a Nazi,
[35:15.760 --> 35:19.360]  Trump's a misogynist, Trump's a racist, Trump's a rapist, none of it true.
[35:20.880 --> 35:24.560]  They do the same thing with them for wars because they know we're looking out
[35:24.560 --> 35:30.080]  for the average person and for free market, for a level playing field, for a true open society,
[35:30.080 --> 35:37.600]  that Jeff Bezos and all the rest of them don't like. So they have the Maryman Smith award for
[35:37.600 --> 35:46.720]  excellence in journalism on presidential reporting, whatever that means. And just like
[35:49.040 --> 35:54.080]  they gave Obama when he was president-elect a Nobel Peace Prize and he launched more wars
[35:54.080 --> 36:02.560]  than the last three presidents combined. Think about that. Let's put the award back on screen
[36:02.560 --> 36:08.400]  for TV viewers here. I'll read it to viewers and listeners because I want to go over this for people.
[36:08.400 --> 36:14.720]  You guys put the Maryman Smith award. It's $2,500 reward, not the half million, I guess the Nobel
[36:14.720 --> 36:19.200]  is. What's the Nobel now? Let's hook that up. The Maryman Smith Memorial Award for excellence
[36:19.200 --> 36:25.440]  in presidential news coverage under deadline pressure originated in 1970 in memory of Maryman
[36:25.440 --> 36:32.160]  Smith of United Press International, a wide-eyed correspondent of more than 30 years. The $2,500
[36:32.160 --> 36:38.160]  award was conceived to perpetuate Miss Smith's memory and to promote the excellence he brought to
[36:38.160 --> 36:45.760]  his profession. The award is offered in two categories. Print, newspaper, wire service magazine,
[36:45.760 --> 36:53.520]  broadcasts, radio and television. So drum roll please. Did they give the award to Jake Tapper
[36:53.520 --> 36:59.200]  and two other CNN reporters for reporting on a plane crashing or the fires in California
[36:59.200 --> 37:05.200]  or something where they could actually tell the truth and maybe do a good job? No, no, no, no, no.
[37:05.200 --> 37:10.400]  They didn't give them an award for fake town halls in Parkland where only anti-gunners were allowed
[37:10.400 --> 37:14.080]  in and given prescripted questions. They didn't give them an award for a few years ago,
[37:14.080 --> 37:16.800]  singing in scripting questions for the debate, not telling Trump.
[37:19.600 --> 37:24.960]  No, they gave them an award for being the go-to leakers, as the Daily Caller has said.
[37:24.960 --> 37:36.480]  They gave them an award, drum roll please, for their coverage of the steel fusion GPS
[37:37.520 --> 37:43.680]  PP dossier that is admitted to be a total fraud paid for by the FBI directly to their
[37:43.680 --> 37:48.400]  wives and husbands at the firm as a payoff. And then I love how Comey's been on the news this
[37:48.400 --> 37:53.200]  week saying the Republicans paid for it. Well, there was some early Jeb Bush stuff with another
[37:53.200 --> 37:59.520]  company that he didn't like Trump, so he passed it on to them. But that was mafia stuff. That was
[38:00.480 --> 38:09.440]  not this. Opposition research, and that was fake too. So this is so amazing
[38:10.720 --> 38:15.120]  that they're so delusional, they're so disconnected. They would give Obama a peace prize when he had
[38:15.120 --> 38:21.040]  never even been in office at an executive branch involved in the military. He'd never been in the
[38:21.040 --> 38:26.320]  Coast Guard. He'd never been in the Boy Scouts. He'd never been in the Army Reserves. He'd never
[38:27.120 --> 38:32.800]  put a rifle over his shoulder. He'd never been in the Peace Corps. He'd never done a diplomatic
[38:32.800 --> 38:38.640]  errand. He'd done nothing, but he got the award. Now, does Trump get a Nobel Peace Prize? I nominate
[38:39.200 --> 38:44.480]  President Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize already for just getting North and South Korea to meet
[38:44.480 --> 38:50.160]  after almost 60 years since 1953 when the armistice happened. There's been a continued war. They just
[38:50.160 --> 38:55.520]  met last week, shook hands, and agreed to a peace treaty to end the war after 60 plus years.
[38:58.160 --> 39:00.640]  Nobel Prize is now 1.4 million. Wow, it's up.
[39:04.080 --> 39:11.520]  I guess it's 2.6 in Dutch money. Nobel who invented dynamite and felt guilty about it,
[39:11.520 --> 39:18.880]  nitroglycerin. So I am nominating President Trump for the Peace Prize for trying to get us out of
[39:18.880 --> 39:24.960]  Syria for beginning to end the Korean War. And if he does get this peace deal, and they do
[39:24.960 --> 39:30.080]  denuclearize, and they do agree to merge North and South to a future deal, he absolutely must
[39:30.080 --> 39:34.720]  have it. But don't hold your breath because it's a fake award. The award would mean something
[39:34.720 --> 39:43.120]  that was given to real people. Like Markel Thalen broke five years ago for Info Wars,
[39:43.120 --> 39:48.720]  the entire Stingray document plan nationwide to our risk as an operation. We got threatened for that.
[39:48.720 --> 39:54.320]  Zero coverage, the AP reported on it a month ago with the same documents. Where's Markel Thalen's
[39:54.320 --> 39:58.800]  Pulitzer Prize? But the Pulitzer Prize is there for being a lapdog. We don't want your prizes.
[39:58.800 --> 40:03.120]  Our prizes are the people supporting us, getting the word out, having success, and living in a
[40:03.120 --> 40:15.280]  freer, better country and world. That's our prize. Now, let's go ahead and go to the amazing video
[40:15.280 --> 40:22.000]  of CNN being given an award for reporting on a known fraud, which Clapper has now been caught
[40:23.520 --> 40:25.280]  lying about yet again. Here it is.
[40:25.280 --> 40:30.560]  The Merriman Smith Award honors presidential news coverage under deadline pressure.
[40:31.200 --> 40:37.120]  The award is in memory of the late, great Merriman Smith of United Press International,
[40:37.120 --> 40:41.440]  a White House correspondent for more than 30 years. It is given in two categories,
[40:41.440 --> 40:50.160]  Peace, Broadcast, and Print. The Merriman Smith Award for Broadcast goes to Evan Perez, Jim
[40:50.160 --> 40:54.640]  Chudeau, Jake Tapper, and Carl Bernstein of CNN.
[40:59.760 --> 41:05.520]  I nominate President Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize from the great Swedish inventor of dynamite,
[41:05.520 --> 41:14.720]  Nobel. And he's the one getting peace in the peninsula.
[41:28.720 --> 41:32.880]  Stop right there for a minute. So that they skip over the fact it's admitted to be fake now
[41:32.880 --> 41:39.360]  and give them an award for their reporting on how they were briefed that we've got this
[41:39.360 --> 41:46.320]  ridiculous footage of hookers marking their territory. So again, I nominate President Trump
[41:46.320 --> 41:52.880]  for the Nobel Peace Prize for the inventor of dynamite, Nitro Glycerin, Mr. Nobel of Sweden,
[41:53.760 --> 41:58.160]  and I nominate that he go ahead and get it now because he did way more getting north and south
[41:58.160 --> 42:02.800]  to end the war and agreed to signing an armistice and agreed to nuclearize. Even if it doesn't all
[42:02.800 --> 42:09.360]  happen, he's gotten more done light years than Obama ever did. So let's go out to break with
[42:09.360 --> 42:13.440]  the rest of this sickening display, these people getting an award. You may remember that story.
[42:16.320 --> 42:21.520]  Plus again, you may remember that story. It's all a big joke. See, we remember it's fake. The
[42:21.520 --> 42:25.120]  public doesn't. So we're going to bring it back up and hope they don't remember again. Here it is.
[42:25.120 --> 42:31.520]  FBI Director James Comey, personally briefed Trump about the dossier. The judges called their
[42:31.520 --> 42:37.760]  reporting breaking news at its very best. Okay, yeah, fake news at its best. There you go. We're
[42:37.760 --> 42:42.400]  going to go to break. There's Jake Tapper up there all of them. This is a true comedy. They're all
[42:42.400 --> 42:47.760]  up there laughing. Oh my gosh, why not give them awards for walking on the moon or, you know,
[42:48.960 --> 42:52.640]  beating Hitler or whatever. Well, it's George Soros, by the way, that physically cut Hitler's
[42:52.640 --> 42:57.760]  head off by the way. Yeah, he was Captain America. Give me my award for that. Report it, please.
[42:59.680 --> 43:04.480]  I'm so excited. The new product at infowarslife.com in a glass bottle,
[43:04.480 --> 43:11.440]  two month servings filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill. This is a
[43:11.440 --> 43:17.920]  heart and brain pill, a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it. But boy, does it stimulate
[43:17.920 --> 43:23.360]  because it's beyond that. Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors
[43:24.000 --> 43:28.000]  prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people
[43:28.000 --> 43:34.240]  $100, $200 for the formulae. And I came up with our own formulae working with some scientists
[43:34.240 --> 43:41.840]  and developers non GMO made right here in America, 120 capsules. And ladies and gentlemen, you add
[43:41.840 --> 43:47.760]  the preglonone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even
[43:47.760 --> 43:55.680]  make the hormones in your glands. It is amazing. Red pill now available at infowarsstore.com

[47:40.720 --> 47:47.920]  we are back live coming up next hour jake loy one of our great info wars reporters also army
[47:47.920 --> 47:55.680]  combat vet patriot he went out on the road with me today to whole foods now owned by jeff bezos
[47:55.680 --> 48:02.960]  bezos the head of amazon they is now basically degrading the quality of the food there that's in
[48:02.960 --> 48:08.160]  the news most of us not organic now he's doing all the regular stuff he does but the issue is he
[48:08.160 --> 48:14.720]  made 12 billion dollars in one day last week due to government contracts kickbacks cia contracts
[48:14.720 --> 48:23.200]  uh a dollar 50 on every package he ships usps other people don't get that now there's bloomberg 12
[48:23.200 --> 48:30.400]  billion he made just last week he's an anti gunner he's an anti free marketer he said
[48:30.400 --> 48:35.840]  trump is killing our democracy i thought trump got elected so he's a globalist so that's all
[48:35.840 --> 48:40.800]  coming up but first we'll have some of the footage for tv and radio listeners that we're
[48:40.800 --> 48:45.920]  going to air here if when i went in there today the full footage is up on info wars dot com here's
[48:45.920 --> 48:54.720]  a jack vasovic tweet from friday while they were calling him a war monger a homophobe and a racist
[48:55.360 --> 49:01.280]  donald trump ended the korean war appointed the first gay ambassador to germany and got endorsed
[49:01.280 --> 49:07.920]  by kanya all the same week and it's not about just cheerleading trump but trump is pragmatically
[49:07.920 --> 49:14.080]  trying to create a level playing field and bring jobs into this country and so i didn't even know
[49:14.080 --> 49:18.320]  till i said it and they pulled it up i didn't even know the new york post is reported the lobbying
[49:18.320 --> 49:24.000]  for trump's nobel peace prize has already begun well i think the nobel peace prize is worthless
[49:25.040 --> 49:34.480]  because they've given henry kissinger and al gore and maroc obama peace prizes they're jokes
[49:34.480 --> 49:40.800]  yeah back when they gave alexander schultz and eason won or martin luther king won or gondy won
[49:40.800 --> 49:46.720]  they had some meaning i would not accept a nobel prize or i'd take the money and give it to charity
[49:46.720 --> 49:51.920]  because it's a million and a half dollars seriously the thing is a joke but the nomination process
[49:52.560 --> 49:56.320]  has begun it's very very serious because north and south have declared the end of the war they're
[49:56.320 --> 50:01.680]  going to sign a deal ahead of the meeting with trump the war has been going on since the armistice
[50:01.680 --> 50:07.680]  was signed in it's been going on since late 49 but it's been ongoing just the ceasefire since the
[50:07.680 --> 50:19.120]  armistice in february of 1953 so we'll see what happens there ladies and gentlemen it just shows
[50:19.120 --> 50:24.160]  how dramatic trump has been delivering on so many fronts now let's move on to the big news
[50:24.160 --> 50:33.040]  by the way i'm pretty original but when i rip off rush limbaugh i do it
[50:38.400 --> 50:42.480]  i like doing that occasionally i'm like a pavlovian dog nicer limbaugh do that like
[50:42.480 --> 50:48.800]  in high school and college i get really excited like the anticipation i think i do it better
[50:48.800 --> 50:56.480]  though okay i'm gonna stop let's get serious look clapper doesn't matter brennan doesn't
[50:56.480 --> 51:00.800]  matter hillary doesn't matter except they're still the deep state dug in with their operatives
[51:00.800 --> 51:07.200]  in government dug in like ticks doing whatever they want whenever they want however they want
[51:07.200 --> 51:14.800]  leaking criminally lying to congress getting caught finally though it's even in mainstream news even
[51:14.800 --> 51:22.160]  the hill had a report on it zero hedge has the best article it's up on info wars dot com clapper
[51:22.160 --> 51:27.440]  busted leaking dossier details to cnn's jake tapper lying to congress about it now remember
[51:28.000 --> 51:32.720]  the statute of limitations in it a few months ago five years after he testified to congress and did
[51:32.720 --> 51:37.360]  i forget to tell you guys pull that up to pull that up next just typing clapper lies to congress is
[51:37.360 --> 51:44.160]  famous and he says no the nsa does not listen to anything in the u.s or read anything no just
[51:44.160 --> 51:50.080]  everything by the time he said that everything except cb radio transmissions goes through an
[51:50.080 --> 51:56.080]  nsa hub and most of those do you don't think the nsa doesn't know someone on a cb or another radio
[51:56.080 --> 52:00.960]  or ham radio is really trying not to be heard they're really listening to that so but they don't
[52:00.960 --> 52:07.120]  catch it all and it's totally unconstitutional clapper busted leaking dossier details to cnn's
[52:07.120 --> 52:12.240]  jake tapper tapper just got an award for the fake reporting earlier showed you that lying to congress
[52:12.240 --> 52:18.160]  about it we look forward to clapper talking his way out of this one on cnn during carefully scripted
[52:18.160 --> 52:23.600]  conversations with fellow talking heads that was on friday and then it just goes through all the
[52:23.600 --> 52:28.720]  times he testified to congress when he saw all the news articles all the under oath it's a long
[52:28.720 --> 52:33.440]  article where he said it where he did it there's videos of it everything i mean it is we should
[52:33.440 --> 52:39.200]  make a special report out of this just to show it all it is incredible but he said i did not leak the
[52:39.200 --> 52:46.320]  dossier now that's being pointed out it's fake and it's illegal he went on radio and tv to say he
[52:46.320 --> 52:54.480]  leaked it before so even don lemon is throwing clapper overboard which is a sign that when don
[52:54.480 --> 53:03.920]  lemon is throwing your butt overboard when don lemon is looking at you like you're a liar he thinks
[53:03.920 --> 53:07.680]  you're in big trouble and he better not side with you because he's as bad as bad as it gets
[53:07.680 --> 53:12.560]  when it comes to fake news some of the worst people you know just like tapper it's cnn getting
[53:12.560 --> 53:17.120]  awards for fake journalism so when he throws your overboard that's the rat leaving the sinking ship
[53:18.160 --> 53:23.680]  here is that video already held by the media and i i didn't have any contact with media
[53:24.240 --> 53:29.200]  until after i left the government on the 20th of january so i don't quite understand at least what
[53:29.200 --> 53:36.320]  i've read uh that somehow i leaked about the dossier so let me get so you didn't leak anything
[53:36.320 --> 53:42.320]  about the dossier to any media no not i mean i talked about it after i left the government
[53:42.880 --> 53:49.200]  but uh not during that period uh not and certainly not between the sixth of january and the and the
[53:49.200 --> 53:54.000]  tenth when the president elect himself talked about it so you're you're saying the president
[53:54.000 --> 54:00.480]  elect himself as the one who put it out there well it it was publicized if i remember the sequence
[54:00.480 --> 54:09.600]  it came out uh after our uh trump tar briefing and you know all our purpose there was to to
[54:09.600 --> 54:15.120]  inform him that it was out there and i've often wondered because it's kind of controversial
[54:15.120 --> 54:21.280]  that now that we brought this up that if had we not told him about it and then he learned about it
[54:21.280 --> 54:24.800]  and we and he learned that the intelligence community knew about it and didn't tell him well
[54:24.800 --> 54:31.520]  it'd been probably been held that we got in tweets for that too uh so i don't understand this uh
[54:31.520 --> 54:40.000]  how you know i leaked it to to to cnn yeah he works for cnn now he's on record we've got the
[54:40.000 --> 54:44.480]  article of all the clips right here everybody remembers clapper did that they all did it they
[54:44.480 --> 54:52.080]  all bragged we got plenty of dirt obama was in the new york times on the 20th of january 2017
[54:52.080 --> 54:58.560]  i was in dc 50 feet from the president when he was being sworn in and i'm sitting there waiting
[54:58.560 --> 55:02.640]  for him to come up read the new york times tucked under my jacket this very jacket by the way funny
[55:02.640 --> 55:07.440]  i wore this very jacket strangely and that's my favorite jacket and this thing like five six years
[55:07.440 --> 55:14.640]  is getting holes in it but we did a live report before roger stoner and i went in to the inauguration
[55:15.440 --> 55:19.760]  of reading that where it was intelligence heads clapper and others say they had the information
[55:19.760 --> 55:24.160]  they had the proof they were wiretapping trump tower all sort of stuff and then he gets up there
[55:24.160 --> 55:31.200]  and says he never said it he's caught red handed the classified congressional report yeah it's in
[55:31.200 --> 55:35.520]  the new report i should add that clapper lied about dossier leaks to cnn should have opened
[55:35.520 --> 55:39.680]  the whole segment with that congress reporting he lied to them yes he lied to them lied to congress
[55:39.680 --> 55:45.920]  but information he shared with cnn on the infamous steel dossier wow but let's play another time he
[55:45.920 --> 55:53.440]  lied to you this is five years ago telling congress that the nsa has never spied on anyone in the us
[55:54.640 --> 55:59.520]  this is years after it came out that every phone call every text message every email
[55:59.520 --> 56:05.840]  everything digital is sent through giant hubs at telecoms and then onto the nsa so here it is
[56:06.720 --> 56:13.760]  is if you could give me a yes or no answer to the question does the nsa collect any type of data
[56:13.760 --> 56:24.400]  at all on millions or hundreds of millions of americans no sir it does not not wittingly
[56:25.680 --> 56:32.400]  there are cases where they could inadvertently perhaps collect but not not wittingly
[56:36.240 --> 56:39.520]  so it's like saying a pedophile accidentally grabbed your five-year-old out of your backyard

[01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:08.480]  there is a lot of controversy around this network about alex jones for example
[01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:12.480]  for
[01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:16.960]  alex jones the foray conspiracy theorist who was a parent
[01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:24.960]  alex jones
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.400]  scott russians scott
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:39.200]  alex jones
[01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:45.360]  reputations amazing i will not let you down you will be very very impressed i hope
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:55.520]  well they say the wheels of justice turn slowly and yes they do but the arrogance
[01:00:55.520 --> 01:01:03.040]  of bureaucracies burns fast but when it burns away there's nothing left but a bunch of little
[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:08.720]  cowards who got themselves all wound up because they were accustomed to power didn't understand
[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:13.600]  the people had voted their asses out and yes in most major elections it doesn't really count much
[01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:18.720]  but what trumpet does that's why you've seen the conniption fits the hysterics the insanity
[01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:24.720]  the crazy lies the distortions the bullying the boycotts the attacks the subterfuge because an
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:30.800]  entire corrupt establishment for decades had hijacked this country and had been mismanaging
[01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:38.400]  it into the ground along came trump and the patriot elements of the pentagon and intelligence
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:44.880]  agencies you don't just think it's trump do you and along came a consortium of patriots who've been
[01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:53.920]  working in some cases for 60 years to stop the globalist i'm only on a organic extension not
[01:01:53.920 --> 01:02:00.080]  some secret agents not some secret agency not some secret orders not some black op training
[01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:06.960]  center when i was 10 years old but simply growing up in texas is americana around men who'd fought
[01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:12.560]  for the country and who knew the score knew understand who the globalists were and who simply
[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:19.600]  talked about what they knew in front of me as a young boy and so i studied history i thought
[01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:24.480]  they were right and i sat there and decided when i was 12 13 years old i was going to take them on
[01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:31.120]  that's what destiny's all about they don't want you to think you've got destiny yeah half the
[01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:35.840]  time when i cover here's the train wreck doesn't matter i'm swinging for the fences i'm going
[01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:41.440]  in the right direction i care about justice i want freedom and they don't know what to do in the deep
[01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:53.200]  state trump was recruited by patriots in the government to stop the total humiliation of the
[01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:59.040]  country we've already sold out to china we've already are crippled psychologically culturally
[01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:06.960]  mentally we're already in destitute shape but the globalists wanted to fully have a civil war
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:12.720]  a race-based war they want to break us completely and have reeducation camps everything else it was
[01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:16.960]  even coming out in the news not just me covering it and patriots in our own government said the
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:22.000]  people are awake they want something different let's try to stop this this is unbelievably bad
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:26.080]  rigging debates they want to arrest all the conservatives they want to break up families
[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:30.400]  they want to have the state run everything this is a horrible system why would we do this so some
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:36.400]  hollywood and globalist elites like the rothschilds and the rockefellers and some of the others have
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:43.840]  their way with us we're not doing this so right now trump is really like a desperate
[01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:50.160]  rearguard action hoping while he stalls them you wake up and do something and from romania to
[01:03:50.160 --> 01:04:00.400]  hungary to island to brazil to japan to areas of africa to all over the world from katalan spain to
[01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:07.280]  you name it they'd say katalan katalan mr jones i get it i got to say geographically for folks
[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:12.640]  listening people get it they say listen our local governments aren't perfect but they're not run by
[01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:18.240]  some guy like jeff bezos whose tax at jim who makes 12 billion dollars a day well well they tell me on
[01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:22.880]  the news i'm rich if i make a million dollars a year and pay 40 percent of it in taxes and then
[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:31.040]  the other lawyers trying to hire people trying to run something trying to do so show that's what
[01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:36.640]  it comes down to ladies and gentlemen is the boys from the men the women from the girls which side
[01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:41.200]  you want to be on but i am very proud to be part of this giant awakening and very proud of what
[01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:44.960]  we're all doing together and standing against the incredible arrogance of clapper and all these
[01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:48.400]  other crooks they thought they'd tell all these lies and do all these things and get away with it
[01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:52.320]  because they thought they were invincible they thought they'd beaten us they didn't know we were

[01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:10.480]  part of a continuing cover russian intelligence compiled a dossier on mr trump during visits to
[01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:17.840]  muska russian stop denied everything he called it all fake news and he accused cnn of being fake news
[01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:24.400]  this is a national emergency if they kill trump or remove trump it will cause a massive civil war
[01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:31.520]  in this country this is a female high-level emergency you're at war with russia are you aware
[01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:35.840]  that mr. stone also stated publicly that he was in direct communication with julien assange

[01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:07.920]  about a minute or so of it here in just a moment alex jones jones confronted by bezos thugs i'd
[01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:12.960]  say thug only one of the security guys seem to be in charge at whole foods was a jerk who were
[01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:16.880]  already standing on the corner of the property off the property and he came over and said get
[01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:20.720]  out of here i'm calling the police and i said well i go in your parking garage and get my car he
[01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:24.800]  wouldn't answer that made me think i was gonna get arrested when i went down there to get my car
[01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:28.880]  and follow me to my car so i'm coming back i'm already planning to come back but now
[01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:32.960]  coming back a lot because people were polite to me they were nice to me most of the folks in
[01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:39.760]  whole foods were listeners uh in in in big blue state austin blue state cancer austin
[01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:47.760]  but you try to stop me and bully me i'm coming back that's coming up later in the hour because
[01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:52.000]  i've got a bunch of other things i want to get to i want to get into trump on kanya he says kanya
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:59.360]  gets it and how they're trying to bully kanya and that major uh bellwether also msnbc guest says
[01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:03.680]  mike pinch would put gay people in concentration camps who became the president well trump is
[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:08.080]  appointed a gay ambassador to germany nobody's ever done that and i'm not trying to like win
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:14.320]  points here or something it's that trump's incredibly inclusive and wants americana and
[01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:19.040]  as the economy comes back and as he gets this big peace deal i mean they north and south
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:24.080]  disagree to sign an armistice that will then go into a total peace deal and in the war or in the
[01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:29.440]  armistice uh you've got huge things happening because the globalist wanted a strategy of
[01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:33.840]  tension i know you're a veteran yourself understands strategies of tension but like trump said when
[01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:41.440]  he was with merkel on friday he said we are going to move away from playing games and keeping crises
[01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:46.880]  going yeah and and what a lot of people don't get is the strategies that trump employs trump
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:53.440]  understands how russians and chinese and these other eastern nations negotiate because western
[01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:58.720]  europe like germany you know obama negotiated and he he conducted diplomacy like merkel and like
[01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:03.760]  macron would he doesn't understand that there's a way you have to put pressure on russia and china
[01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:08.000]  north korea those other nations because that's what they respect and that's how they respond
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:11.760]  to pressure it's a respect game and that's what people like obama don't understand so when trump
[01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:16.640]  is putting pressure on these people he's actually understanding the proper way to operate and i would
[01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:23.120]  expand on that by pressure serious sanctions on the regime itself a year and a half of that
[01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:28.400]  and then saying but here's the carrot merge with south korea have a new business deal really go
[01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:31.920]  into the future but give up your nuclear weapons and as i reported over a month ago from our sources
[01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:38.480]  they already jake loyde had agreed to that and and now you see comes young on it's come out has
[01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:44.720]  already agreed to that yeah he's already agreed to it and what people i mean five months ago it was
[01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:50.960]  five months ago that people thought that we were going to go to nuclear conflict with north korea
[01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:55.280]  and now five months later like you said north and south korea they're talking they're about to end
[01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:59.680]  the 60 some year armistice they're about to come to peace there's probably going to be massive
[01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:03.440]  infrastructure deals where they're reuniting they're building highways and stuff between the two
[01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:07.920]  cities north korea is going to be brought out of poverty and it's all due to the efforts by president
[01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:13.200]  trump when he was putting pressure like you said massive sanctions but also talking about fire and
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:18.720]  fury and i would say that probably going forward i'm predicting that the same strategy is going to
[01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:23.200]  be employed with iran we're going to see a similar thing because trump with syria and everything he
[01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:28.320]  demonstrated that he's willing to uh you know we don't like the syria bombings but he's willing to
[01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:33.920]  go against what russia says so that that's going to allow him to put pressure on iran and i think
[01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:38.160]  that we're going to see a massive uh reworking of the iran deal to include the whole middle east
[01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:42.000]  sure well i got what trump was doing on the whole chemical weapons thing they've got the white
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:46.800]  helmets caught now four times but that's in the news this week it's now they have all the witnesses
[01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:50.960]  the kids that were brought in from school and dalson water are all in the news saying we were
[01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:56.080]  told it was a fake chemical attack we were given candy we were given lunch i mean this is all coming
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:12:00.400]  out that they staged that thing but i understand trump's face with that he'll look weekly doesn't
[01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:04.720]  strike so he strikes some of these bases gives the russians time to get out the russians are already
[01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:10.240]  trying to pull out that looks strong to iran but let's pull back from that the mainstream media
[01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:15.040]  said it was the end of the world and that we were going to have nuclear war even two weeks ago the
[01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:20.000]  viewed joy bayhar all of them said trump's going to cause a nuclear war that kim jong-un is good
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:25.440]  compared to our president now they're not even reporting on how big a deal this is yeah well
[01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:29.520]  and now what they're saying even though you know fought like i said five months ago like you're
[01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:34.400]  talking about just a couple weeks ago trump was the cause of every negative thing in north korea
[01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:38.400]  it was his fault that we were about to go to nuclear war it's his fault that all these bad you know
[01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:42.560]  supposedly bad things are happening and now like you said good things are happening and they want
[01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:47.600]  to put the credit on prime minister moon of south korea they want to put it on jijin ping of china
[01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:51.920]  they want to give all the credit to everybody else and there is some element of credit due to them
[01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:56.080]  even though trump was the one pressuring china to pressure north korea but they want to take
[01:12:56.080 --> 01:13:01.120]  all of the credit away i mean i'd say 90 percent goes to us 80 percent you know russia had a big
[01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:04.960]  piece in actually saying they might back a u.s strike if kim jong-un didn't stop what he was
[01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:12.960]  doing but but expanding on that pull back from this 1953 is when this ended the war was still
[01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:20.800]  going with the ceasefire versus 2018 that's 60 plus years that never got fixed until now so it did
[01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:26.080]  change because of real sanctions the globalist on record wanted a strategy of tension it was clinton
[01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:30.400]  and others that gave the nuclear weapons and missiles to north korea to destabilize things
[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:35.680]  trump is ending all this macchiabellion crap i mean most americans like this is something
[01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:40.880]  that hasn't we haven't been at peace with korea in most americans living history it's an enormous
[01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:45.040]  monumental thing and like you're talking about with the the strategy of tension and everything
[01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:52.720]  that keeps the globalist um one world government plans in order because then it requires organizations
[01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:56.800]  like the u and it requires organizations like the un to come in and try to fix things even
[01:13:56.800 --> 01:14:00.640]  though they don't and that's what david rockefeller's dad said with the league of nations then the u
[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:05.040]  and the rockefeller's built in new york on their own land was about a strategy of ongoing tension
[01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:10.000]  where you need them running things these multinational groups instead of unilaterally
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:14.560]  nations making the old deal you can have 50 countries making a deal they've just got to do it
[01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:20.320]  unilaterally exactly and what what i don't think a lot of people get is that trump you know whatever
[01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:24.480]  whatever his strategies are on a lot of stuff whether you love him or hate him he's transcending
[01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:30.080]  it's possible to transcend that order of requiring a new uh like the world government and that's why
[01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:33.920]  the bureaucrats are so pissed because he's being the president does that mean i agree with everything
[01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:39.760]  he does as president no do i agree with him being the president returning power back to the presidency
[01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:45.920]  back to congress back to the states back to the people as he promised to do a year and a half ago
[01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:52.480]  on january 20th 2017 at that inauguration he said we're transferring it back to you we're going back
[01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:59.200]  to the republic they had to do one-sided deals to sell america out to globalism they had to get
[01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:04.960]  the whole world to sign on with parlaying when america had 60 of the world's wealth in 1955
[01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:10.000]  now we have way less than like a you know 20 they sold us out to special interest but instead
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:17.760]  of it being infrastructure for africa or latin america or asia it became jeff bezos bezos gets
[01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:22.800]  you know 140 billion and this guy gets that it's it's the globalism's been a lie it's been a new
[01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:27.920]  form of robber bearing colonialism where they're now using in their own words the third world
[01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:33.440]  populations to recolonize us but not to empower us but to drive us down as well exactly and what
[01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:37.680]  you know it's important to realize that like it says in the bible if you're not with us you're
[01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:41.760]  against us it's the same because every action that trump carries out that's not out of the new
[01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:46.800]  world order playbook it's an action to reestablish national sovereignty for the us and that's what i
[01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:51.840]  100 agree with and i agree with 95 percent of what trump's done uh it's a very very dangerous game
[01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:56.320]  but he is real you know him by his enemies folks that's why we defend him so much stay with us
[01:15:57.360 --> 01:16:02.160]  you know if i tried to sit here and tell you about the 60 plus products we have it in fuller's life

[01:16:55.040 --> 01:17:02.080]  revolution they use their media to assassinate real news they use their schools to teach children
[01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:07.600]  that their president is another hitler they use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and
[01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:13.440]  award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again and then they use their ex-president
[01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:20.160]  to endorse the resistance all to make them march make them protest make them scream racism and
[01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:27.120]  sexism and xenophobia and homophobia to smash windows burn cars shut down interstates and airports
[01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:33.520]  bully and terrorize the law abiding until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs
[01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:40.400]  and stop the madness and when that happens they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage the only
[01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:48.240]  way we stop this the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies

[01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:56.400]  can't so uh good luck with that rex is uh rex is here to stay the fact that folks are trying to
[01:20:56.400 --> 01:21:01.040]  keep him off air i think it's actually only been encouraging but jake loy i wanted to briefly
[01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:09.600]  in this segment get with viewers into how we're under attack now i don't get up here like some
[01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:20.320]  sjw saying i'm a victim i want victim status i'm a big baby look at poor little me no i'm saying
[01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:25.040]  i'm trying to be a warrior for this country politically i'm standing up for us right we
[01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:29.840]  have delivered big time and waking up the public you delivered big time as an audience our affiliates
[01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:34.880]  our sponsors you're amazing so the praise 90 percent of it goes to you the rest goes this
[01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:42.880]  crew and what we're doing here that said a lot of this is off record i went to dc for four days
[01:21:43.760 --> 01:21:48.000]  three weeks ago and i can't get into most of what i was there was not what you saw me there for
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:54.160]  four and though that was all secondary and i met with some high level folks i'll leave it to you
[01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:59.680]  at that i'm sure you can figure it out high level and they said they gave me the analysis they gave
[01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:05.040]  me the intel and i was told not to get into obviously all of it but i can tell you that we've
[01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:13.600]  already pointed this out there's 15 million a year spent by soros just to fake media to dig
[01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:19.120]  up lies on us they can't find anything they've gone down to our reporters now six months on paul
[01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:25.840]  octson in england they're like the three person team on him this is like a movie but it's real so
[01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:33.840]  you need to understand ladies and gentlemen that we are fighting because we know we're under attack
[01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:38.080]  not because we're angels not because we're perfect but because we don't want to be under a
[01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:45.440]  nazi collaborators control so zero hedge reports on links to the federalist and and leak documents
[01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:52.800]  that congress has put out this week in their intelligence report of the latest strock page
[01:22:53.520 --> 01:23:00.160]  garbage mystery group of wealthy donors with with with us generals over it at the meetings
[01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:06.000]  so they're going to hotels with sitting us generals that are running and on showing all this
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:14.240]  to try to stop donald trump now that's just one tranche one group of the money mystery group
[01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:19.680]  of wealthy donors and soros spends 50 million for private trump russia investigation that's after
[01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:29.360]  it came out the fbi was funding it this is the last year 50 million soros puts out 15 million
[01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:36.080]  a year according to my sources so these report and i even had reporters apologized to me off record
[01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:40.240]  they don't know man but i mean i want the 200 grand or whatever you know i mean this is going on
[01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:44.080]  show and i'm lucky they're not sending hit teams down here but they do that that's fine too i don't
[01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:48.880]  want to die but if anything happens to be hillary soros the globalist they're the main suspects now
[01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:54.960]  and i don't say it's act tough or to challenge them it's like i'm in a war these are criminals
[01:23:54.960 --> 01:24:00.640]  in third world countries they can get away with it they engage in massive atrocities but i raise
[01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:07.920]  this because the observer is owned by jared kushner now i'm not even attacked jared kushner
[01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:13.920]  because i can't figure out whether he's really good or really neutral or really bad i tend to
[01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:20.000]  trust trump so i'm not i'm not in some you know white house intrigue about who i support or who i
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:26.720]  don't support okay early on i got sucked into some of that i'm not i'm not into that okay but the
[01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:31.520]  observer is owned by a trust he no longer controls it for a year so that's hopefully good news about
[01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:36.080]  jared kushner and i went to it today because there was a bunch of articles attacking me the last month
[01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:46.480]  and it says trump's a russian agent trump's going down uh it says pisk a trio i mean not even the
[01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:54.480]  daily beast says that now not even buzzfeed that made it up put up the fake reporting on it
[01:24:54.480 --> 01:25:01.040]  they admit it's not true now so i go to this story that says what peter teal's playbook shows us
[01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:07.440]  about taking down trump and alex shones now notice taking down alex shones and trump or
[01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:13.120]  trump and alex shones and they admit that the democrats in deep state are funding fake lawsuits
[01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:22.800]  against us to shut us down well here's the difference i didn't video tape in my personal home
[01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:32.240]  my wife climbing on top hulk hogan i think hulk hogan's pretty cool by the way i'm told he's a
[01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:42.000]  listener the point is is that if i did that i deserve to be getting big trouble i'm not getting
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:46.480]  buddies over to my house to have sex with my wife and videotaping it i'm not gawker but they say
[01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:53.040]  that's the model and they admit it's lawfare to destroy us so the observer even five years ago
[01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:59.040]  three years ago did some pretty good reporting it's bad news now and so i got kushner saying i
[01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:08.240]  deserve his publication to be basically out of business and that his father-in-law is a criminal
[01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:12.000]  that women urinate on that was on the front page today so
[01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:19.280]  i guess that means kushner really doesn't run anymore but my god who'd you hand it over to
[01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:23.440]  me you know it's like because i know this stuff about me isn't true but at least they're being
[01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:27.680]  honest about it's not peter teal suing us by the way he's a good guy he would defend victims this is
[01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:32.080]  them making stuff up using lawfare and they admit if they can do it to info wars just as they had a
[01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:37.280]  news course said two months ago they could do it to everybody so i wanted to show everybody that
[01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:42.240]  to understand it's not like we're losers here and we're bitching and complaining saying send us money
[01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:48.640]  the nra has broken all fundraising records with david hog attacking him saying ban the second
[01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:54.480]  amendment all this stuff well you know i get attacked along with the nra i get sued like the
[01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:59.600]  nra and and our donations are not up our buying of products is not up it's not an election year
[01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:03.840]  i mean last year was an election year this isn't it really isn't because it's kind of the mid-terms
[01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:10.000]  but it's not a main election year not a general election so i'm not complaining here i mean i
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:13.680]  want this i stood up for this i'm doing this but you understand the globalists are obsessed with
[01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:21.280]  info wars they want to shut down they want us destroyed and they admit in this big lengthy
[01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:25.840]  article that they want to take down trump and info wars because we quote can't be stopped
[01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:31.760]  and are bringing populism back to america they're such globalists they admit who we are they go
[01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:36.080]  these horrible nationalists these free market people and they're not elitists like us and
[01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:41.920]  then we've got to destroy them and the only way is to sue them why don't you just get out of the
[01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:48.160]  way and be rich uh in america you jerks and let people have nice apartments and nice houses and
[01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:54.000]  their children and no you got to run everything it's all about your power because i always read
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:57.760]  this in philosophy carl ryan you know you name it i was looking at jordan peterson videos this
[01:27:57.760 --> 01:28:00.880]  morning so i haven't really paid attention to him until he just keeps bigger and bigger so i
[01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:05.760]  watched a bunch of him this morning he was saying weak men cannot be virtuous or strong
[01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:11.920]  weak men cannot be leaders and it's because they're rats and always want to screw somebody over
[01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:17.200]  but it's strong men who have the evil side but also the good side that's bigger who understand
[01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:21.360]  things and don't want to be a jerk it is the bad people that want to pull down somebody like trump
[01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:26.880]  so we come back take loybel talk about this but the bottom line there is weak men can't be virtuous
[01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:32.480]  that was the actual quote good job pulling that up is that i'm really trying to build something
[01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:37.440]  psychopaths think i'm a schmuck or crazy that i believe in you and because i'm strong i'm not
[01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:42.560]  screwing you over i must be a schmuck or i have texas hospitality somebody i bring into town and
[01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:47.520]  they get in my face and tell me i'm their bitch i have texas hospitality because i'm a killer i'm
[01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:52.800]  my dragon i'll rip your head off i'll kill you if i need to if i the point is i'm a loving person

[01:33:47.120 --> 01:33:51.680]  i'm alex jones your host we'll get to the whole whole foods slash amazon foods
[01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:57.280]  jeff bezos command base invasion that happened just a few hours ago you were there with me but
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:02.240]  you were silent during that last segment as i was reading off out of the new york observer
[01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:08.400]  and out of zero hedge and other publications uh jake where they're saying the main job of the
[01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:14.800]  democrats is to shut down trump and info wars we have project veritas internal videos of youtube
[01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:22.000]  facebook twitter google new york times all saying the same thing i'm not tuning my horn i'm not that
[01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:29.360]  big but they see us and what we're saying because they're insiders as super accurate because we're
[01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:35.840]  on target we actually study what they say and do it's not that we're that big it's that if people
[01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:42.480]  listen it's over for them because the microcosm is the agencies i should think the agencies
[01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:47.600]  in the military would not be the problem but weren't part of the solution but then i realized
[01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:51.680]  they're already on the inside so they actually know i'm telling the truth that's the most a woke
[01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:58.240]  group right now and so that's why they're targeting us so just speaking to that because i want to make
[01:34:58.240 --> 01:35:02.640]  us the center of the story but if we don't make a bigger deal out of this they will win they will
[01:35:02.640 --> 01:35:07.920]  destroy us we're not just upper saying oh we're real big they're after us folks we're the main
[01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:11.360]  target why do you think that is jake like well part of it's a chilling effect part of it is
[01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:16.240]  that they want to take they they want to frame it as we're on the outside we're on the fringe of
[01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:21.760]  the uh the the public voice we're on the fringe and they want to say oh it's just info wars don't
[01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:27.520]  worry about them exactly if you go there globalism world government sovereignty will destroy you when
[01:35:27.520 --> 01:35:32.240]  that's the reality they want to make it where we're untouchable exactly because we are an easy
[01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:36.400]  target in their eyes partially because a lot of people that are that should be you know on our
[01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:40.960]  side a lot of people don't want to come to our defense they don't want to defend our right
[01:35:40.960 --> 01:35:45.760]  to free speech because they've bought into the brainwashing that we're you know cuckoo wacko
[01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:50.080]  that's it they want to play it safe or they think so many times when limbaugh was in trouble people
[01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:54.640]  go good you'll be bigger i remember talking to syndicators they go if limbaugh has heart trouble
[01:35:55.680 --> 01:36:00.480]  or if limbaugh this boycott works you're gonna get a lot bigger and i went no i'm not they're
[01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:05.200]  gonna shut all the talk radio down i'm spending a half million dollars then i got ted to spend
[01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:09.680]  another half million we spent no no total half million i was a quarter million he was a quarter
[01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:14.800]  million i spent a half million on limbaugh when these other syndicators were like getting off on
[01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:20.080]  the idea of his fall they'd have any sense that once they boycotted him we were next that they have
[01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:26.080]  they have no i don't hope sean hannity goes down i don't hope that uh people like tucker
[01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:30.880]  carlsson go down i hope they get bigger and bigger i have four children and you have people what is
[01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:36.160]  your problem mainline conservatives celebrating we're under attack you're idiots once they get us
[01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:41.520]  you're next i mean people like ben Shapiro have a serious serious problem with coming at us like
[01:36:41.520 --> 01:36:45.600]  that i mean ben Shapiro you know constantly makes jokes at our expense and everything but then ben
[01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:50.720]  Shapiro goes out to berkeley or even some other you know slightly left less left wing college
[01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:56.720]  and they call him a nut he's a jew he's an orthodox jew and ben Shapiro gets called a nazi by the way i
[01:36:56.720 --> 01:37:02.720]  like i like ben Shapiro i don't really i see a stuff i agree with he's a smart guy and i but i get it
[01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:07.040]  we're under attack it's an easy thing to differentiate himself and say oh i'm reasonable
[01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:10.960]  we don't want to be in the middle of this thing so i'm gonna explain something i'm not trying to win
[01:37:10.960 --> 01:37:19.120]  popularity contest like ben Shapiro or other people i'm here to get people thinking we trailblazed
[01:37:19.120 --> 01:37:25.120]  the entire opening of the movement and people like matt drudge got it matt drudge helped us we were
[01:37:25.120 --> 01:37:29.760]  already on the map go to the next level and i don't give credit for no reason matt drudge went
[01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:33.440]  through a lot of heat for that i know but matt knew we were telling the truth he's reading the same
[01:37:33.440 --> 01:37:37.120]  news we're reading he said we were a talk show host he didn't want to be on the air anymore so he
[01:37:37.120 --> 01:37:40.400]  knew we were covering the same stuff remember hearing drudge like you know 15 years ago about
[01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:45.520]  cloning and human animal kami eras well don't you know when drudge hears me being attacked for that
[01:37:45.520 --> 01:37:49.840]  you'll see drudge put up a big article from the japan times or writers about human animal
[01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:54.880]  kai we're covering real stuff just because that shocks ben Shapiro and he doesn't want to talk
[01:37:54.880 --> 01:37:58.800]  about it because he wants to be kind of on the end crowd you be part of the end crowd i left high
[01:37:58.800 --> 01:38:03.920]  school a long time ago yeah and and and the thing is we like you said we don't need it's not a
[01:38:03.920 --> 01:38:07.600]  popularity contest we don't need to bring them down because they're attacking us but all we're
[01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:12.880]  saying is stop stop the infighting for no reason because ben Shapiro you can do your normal your
[01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:17.040]  normal middle of the road conservative thing all you want that's fine it brings people into the
[01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:20.960]  movement all that different stuff ben Shapiro's brought a lot of college students into thinking
[01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:25.360]  yeah he's great he's very well spoken and it takes different folks take hand of so-and-s
[01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:29.280]  paul Watson says you got to get her on she's super talented have her on five or six times
[01:38:29.280 --> 01:38:33.680]  she gets hired uh by that big group trumps involved with about waking the the uh
[01:38:33.680 --> 01:38:37.840]  colleges up what's the name of any point turning point i was on the plane flying back to austin
[01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:42.640]  once with the head of turning point and then but now that she's on fox news time and wherever we
[01:38:42.640 --> 01:38:47.520]  call her oh we're not cool enough hey kandace i was offered fox news shows three times it's not
[01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:51.680]  we even need you on the show we had you on to boost you because you're a smart big person
[01:38:51.680 --> 01:38:55.840]  having you on after the big story doesn't do anything for us we we push you because you are
[01:38:55.840 --> 01:39:00.960]  articulate and smart and cool you understand you're not safe going with the mainline republicans
[01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:06.560]  that's how they keep you on the reservation i think khanye west understands that yeah khanye
[01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:11.920]  west really does and the thing is a lot of things we're not trying to get accepted we're trying to
[01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:16.560]  overturn the whole paradigm here yeah and a lot of people a lot of people are now using it to say
[01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:20.800]  because they um certain conservative voices were like oh don't listen to khanye west for your
[01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:24.640]  political opinions and nobody said nobody ever said that you should do that because now he's
[01:39:24.640 --> 01:39:29.520]  going back and it's about his courage to say there's simply free speech and even and what
[01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:33.280]  happened to us where that's a big deal to have that courage to say i support the president and
[01:39:33.280 --> 01:39:38.480]  even if he's still a liberal because he said my hero emigans aulis he's still serving to normalize
[01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:44.080]  our type of politics in the mainstream he's still a major cultural he's standing up for free thought
[01:39:44.080 --> 01:39:45.840]  by the way do we have the jordan peterson clip
[01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:52.160]  i saw this clip because i like jordan peterson i saw a few of his things and
[01:39:52.160 --> 01:39:55.600]  you know the crazy debates he's in where they make stuff up about him he's this well-spoken
[01:39:55.600 --> 01:39:58.800]  professor and everything in the left's really straight up so i watched a couple hours of him
[01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:04.400]  last night this morning and this is carl yung psychology but it's also just self-evident
[01:40:04.400 --> 01:40:09.920]  truth that little wimpy weirdos want to dominate control they want emasculated males so they don't
[01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:15.760]  have any competition and i've always said this the weird twisted betas i found are the ones that
[01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:20.240]  get together and set up tyrannies like hitler and others and so you're never going to see virtue
[01:40:20.800 --> 01:40:25.440]  out of one of these people and uh here is the video part of the video where peterson what's
[01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:30.000]  the exact headline i'm going for memory i'm hella prompter free it was uh why why weak men can't
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:36.960]  be virtuous here it is but if you only know how to behave you're just a domesticated house cat
[01:40:36.960 --> 01:40:42.560]  or or a lap dog you have to be you have to push beyond the persona and that's what the integration
[01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:49.680]  of the shadow does from the union perspective it's like to pull that monster that's being edited out
[01:40:49.680 --> 01:40:57.920]  of you to pull that back in and to allow that to reveal itself within your within your increasingly
[01:40:57.920 --> 01:41:03.520]  sophisticated way of being and then you're not just a persona so if you want to push back on your
[01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:08.960]  persona uh are you saying that you have to cultivate your dark your shadow is that yeah well from your
[01:41:08.960 --> 01:41:14.400]  path yeah because the thing is you can't you can't escape from your persona unless you can
[01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:22.240]  say no like here's an here's an example from popular culture um in the harry potter series harry
[01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:26.960]  potter's obviously the hero of the story but he's touched by malevolence right the only reason he
[01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:31.760]  can stand up against evil is because there's some evil in him that that he's incorporated essentially
[01:41:31.760 --> 01:41:38.720]  well that's exactly right and that the persona that the if you're a persona then you're an obedient
[01:41:38.720 --> 01:41:44.720]  citizen but the problem with being an obedient citizen is that if the society tells you to
[01:41:44.720 --> 01:41:50.080]  march the jews off to the death camp for example and you're obedient then that's what you'll do
[01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:55.840]  and it doesn't it isn't like society is civilized then all of a sudden you're performing some
[01:41:55.840 --> 01:42:01.600]  act of a success of approximation how it works it's like you're your obedient citizen and then
[01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:07.600]  you're asked to violate your conscience a little bit yeah and you you have to because you don't
[01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:13.040]  have anything other than that persona and so let's stop right there and i think this interpretation
[01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:17.280]  of carl young is and i know he's doing it for the public he's a smart guy it's an oversimplification
[01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:22.800]  because i wouldn't even call it the shadow you've got conformity but if conformity means evil it's
[01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:28.000]  your light side is saying you can't conform with this evil you've got to go ahead and get in their
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:31.760]  face but i agree if you have a knowledge of evil then you understand what's happening with evil
[01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:36.160]  some of the purest people are totally blind to it because they're so pure those of us that have
[01:42:36.160 --> 01:42:39.520]  kind of a wicked side that though it's a smaller side can actually see into it i think that's what
[01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:42.880]  he's getting to it's a larger lecture it's it's it's it's worth watching and that's why they

[01:50:43.680 --> 01:50:48.080]  for trying to do this for our intention is uh kind of like you see michael morgo's in his shows
[01:50:48.080 --> 01:50:53.760]  things and talks to people jeff bezos has now bought whole foods and so we wanted to come
[01:50:53.760 --> 01:51:00.240]  show people now that the world headquarters of whole foods is now the world headquarters of amazon
[01:51:00.240 --> 01:51:05.200]  foods and that we wanted to then see if people knew about jeff bezos and you're just about the fact
[01:51:05.200 --> 01:51:11.040]  that uh he's a big globalist he pushes anti capitalist agenda publicly but then he's the
[01:51:11.040 --> 01:51:15.520]  richest man in the world to make 12 million dollars in one day last week so we're just simply here in
[01:51:15.520 --> 01:51:20.800]  about i've been a customer here since they just since it was the old one over there 10 years ago
[01:51:20.800 --> 01:51:24.880]  and i was a customer there for about 10 years it's like i was a book people so i've been here many
[01:51:24.880 --> 01:51:30.880]  times i'm just here to uh walk around and actually show people in the live ecosystem here uh at amazon
[01:51:30.880 --> 01:51:36.800]  foods well our management here is actually asked to just quit recording because they don't feel
[01:51:36.800 --> 01:51:41.760]  comfortable with it you know we always have it sure sure that's reasonable can i talk to the
[01:51:41.760 --> 01:51:46.320]  management i'm gonna hold along to see if i'm willing to talk to you when i'm just gonna
[01:51:46.320 --> 01:51:49.600]  pass down finally so no no no no understand what will this we're happy to go i've always
[01:51:49.600 --> 01:51:53.520]  wanted to come shopping later but we're happy to go that's reasonable this is private property
[01:51:53.520 --> 01:51:58.000]  this is bezos's private property he doesn't respect ours he lobbies to in small family
[01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:03.280]  homes he wants 250 square foot coffee departments uzay called for that last week he doesn't want
[01:52:03.280 --> 01:52:06.720]  you to have any money but he made 12 million dollars in one day last week but i agree with
[01:52:06.720 --> 01:52:10.560]  this for property rights and i agree with this security officer's point that this is private
[01:52:10.560 --> 01:52:13.600]  property and they've asked us to stop filming. So what we're going to do is we're going to go
[01:52:13.600 --> 01:52:17.760]  wait outside on the property line. And if you can see the whole talk to the sir, we love to talk to him.
[01:52:17.760 --> 01:52:23.120]  I'll get that thing here. Thank you so much for honoring the private property. Thank you. Thank you.
[01:52:23.120 --> 01:52:26.640]  Let's go ahead and go outside. So there you go. We are honoring private property right now.
[01:52:26.640 --> 01:52:30.800]  We're going to raise those lobbies viciously to him. Dude, let me call you people real fast.
[01:52:30.800 --> 01:52:35.040]  All right, pause right there. And so we're outside and we're on the corner of the property
[01:52:35.040 --> 01:52:38.960]  and a guy charges up and says, I'm going to call the cops on you. And I'm like, that's fine.
[01:52:38.960 --> 01:52:43.040]  We're about to turn the cameras off. Can I just get my car? He wouldn't answer.
[01:52:43.040 --> 01:52:46.160]  Yeah, I mean, we were wrapping up the video. We were about to wrap up the
[01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:50.160]  transmission, get off the phones and everything. And no one's around us. We're on the like,
[01:52:50.160 --> 01:52:53.760]  there's like a park, that little park there. We're at the very corner. No one's around us.
[01:52:53.760 --> 01:52:58.240]  It's us. It's just us standing there. And there's two girls sitting on a bench. They weren't even
[01:52:58.240 --> 01:53:01.840]  there. And it's not like they were eating Whole Foods products or anything. They were just sitting
[01:53:01.840 --> 01:53:05.760]  there. So they're just hanging out. They're loitering on, you know, I guess that's Whole Foods
[01:53:05.760 --> 01:53:09.520]  property still. And then we say, well, we're going to step off on the sidewalk here now.
[01:53:09.520 --> 01:53:12.240]  They're like, well, it's a private prop. That's a private sidewalk,
[01:53:12.240 --> 01:53:14.960]  but then they keep telling us to hop down there. Or they're going to call the police.
[01:53:14.960 --> 01:53:19.520]  So it doesn't, even that story doesn't line up. Well, it just shows the jerk. The first guy was
[01:53:19.520 --> 01:53:24.640]  nice. Yeah. And the other guy's doing his job. Point is it's about Jeff Bezos, Bezos, whatever
[01:53:24.640 --> 01:53:28.080]  you want to say. I'm not going to give the rest of it. It's on him for worse.com. But
[01:53:28.080 --> 01:53:33.040]  he gets taxpayer money. He can make 12 billion a day. That's fine. We're not against free market,
[01:53:33.040 --> 01:53:40.800]  but then he funds Black Lives Matter. He funds Antifa. He funds the Socialist. He works with
[01:53:40.800 --> 01:53:46.640]  Soros. He funds the Washington Post trying to stop our movement. And the big thing is,
[01:53:46.640 --> 01:53:49.760]  I showed my wife this morning, she was asking me about this before I went out there.
[01:53:50.480 --> 01:53:54.960]  He, if you go to Washington Post and type in Alex Jones or just in the search engine,
[01:53:54.960 --> 01:53:59.680]  Alex Jones, Washington Post.com, snake oil. There's all these articles saying I'm a snake
[01:53:59.680 --> 01:54:07.840]  mole salesman. I sell multivitamins. I sell amino acids. I sell like the highest quality stuff.
[01:54:07.840 --> 01:54:12.880]  Bezos can make billions a year, but I can't make millions to fund our operation. I'm bad.
[01:54:12.880 --> 01:54:18.640]  And the left comes like Comedy Central confronted me in DC and ABC and CBS and NBC. You sell something
[01:54:18.640 --> 01:54:22.400]  once you're a con man. And I go, I sell the very same ones, but even better. And they go,
[01:54:22.400 --> 01:54:27.680]  shut up. We're not talking about it. Right. And Jeff Bezos, like you said, his money comes from
[01:54:27.680 --> 01:54:32.160]  these government subsidized monopolies. The government funds him to take over an industry,
[01:54:32.160 --> 01:54:37.280]  to take over these different aspects of the economy. And then with that money, he goes,
[01:54:37.280 --> 01:54:41.600]  like you said, and funds Black Lives Matter. So it's the government using this opportunity
[01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:45.920]  to fund these, these anti-liberty movements. And then just like the Clinton Foundation,
[01:54:45.920 --> 01:54:49.920]  the money goes back to the Democrats. Exactly. That's why they say Trump is quote,
[01:54:49.920 --> 01:54:54.400]  obsessed with Amazon. Yeah, because it's the shadow government. You don't just think he really
[01:54:54.400 --> 01:54:58.960]  made, no one's ever made $14 billion in six months. He made it one day. The guy's gonna
[01:54:58.960 --> 01:55:04.640]  be worth like $500 billion in a few months. He's taking everything over. He's taking over all the
[01:55:04.640 --> 01:55:09.840]  public housing. He just, he's just taking everything over, but he's liberal and pays no taxes. And the
[01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:15.840]  left's like, he pays no tax. He is worth $140 billion. We worship Bezos, Bezos, Bezos.
[01:55:15.840 --> 01:55:19.920]  And he is in Amazon. Aren't they making the cloud for the Pentagon now? Aren't they gonna
[01:55:19.920 --> 01:55:24.000]  do everything? And that doesn't set off any alarm bells in anybody's brain. The fact that
[01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:29.280]  the government subsidizes this guy's entire corporate life. And then he has these contracts
[01:55:29.280 --> 01:55:33.360]  with the government to store all of your data that the government is in. But it's even in the news
[01:55:33.360 --> 01:55:37.040]  that the staff say they're going away from organic. They're getting crap now. I mean,
[01:55:37.600 --> 01:55:41.120]  well, they're moving away. They used to, they used to bring in different, different brands
[01:55:41.120 --> 01:55:45.360]  and sell them there. Now they're trying to bring it all in and be, only sell Whole Foods brand.
[01:55:45.360 --> 01:55:49.760]  They're there. There's three, six, five or whatever it's called. They're trying to only sell Whole
[01:55:49.760 --> 01:55:53.760]  Foods brand so that all of the money comes back. The left will buy it. Let me tell you something.
[01:55:53.760 --> 01:55:59.120]  They eat radioactive, you know, sludge of Bezos. I'm telling you, man, he snap his finger. You're
[01:55:59.120 --> 01:56:04.640]  racist. If you don't, they'd run into Chernobyl, just start gobbling radiation. I mean, if you
[01:56:04.640 --> 01:56:08.800]  told the left to throw their kid off a cliff, they'd do it. They just want to virtue some signal.
[01:56:08.800 --> 01:56:12.320]  Well, it's purely virtue signaling the food, isn't it? The food's no good anymore. And
[01:56:13.680 --> 01:56:17.520]  it's all about, it's just about the cult. It's about the cult of being trendy, the cult of just
[01:56:17.520 --> 01:56:22.000]  Oh, they've got all these magazines about austerity and how to be poor and how sexy it is. That's
[01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:26.000]  Bezos. Well, we'll be back tomorrow with David night in the morning, 8am, myself at 11am. And
