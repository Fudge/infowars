[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.000]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:44.000]  It's Friday, May 5th, 2023.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:58.000]  All right, we have another gigantic, incredibly informative, revolutionary transmission lined up for you today.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000]  And Lord willing, I'll be back Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m., with the Sunday Night Show.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000]  And right after that, Sunday live, 6 to 8 p.m., with Owen Schroer.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000]  I'm here weekdays, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.000]  And I come on right after the great Harrison Smith, weekday mornings, 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., American Journal.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000]  Okay, we have another ultra-massive transmission lined up for you.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:29.000]  Coming up in 30 minutes, Norm Pattis, another one of the lawyers from the Proud Boys show trial, one of many in D.C.,
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000]  four men being given the terrorism conviction for doing absolutely nothing.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000]  The feds had zero evidence, but they have kept controlled juries.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000]  They're in the District of Satan.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000]  And finally, the lawyers will tell you what really went on behind the scenes.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000]  The lawyers will be able to tell you what really went on behind the scenes.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000]  A lot of just incredible criminal activity, total proof of the feds orchestrating the actual break-in,
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]  the judge suppressing all of that.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:09.000]  You will get that information coming up at the bottom of the hour, in T-minus 27 minutes or so.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000]  J6 political prisoners' attorneys' evidence confirms J6 was an organized government plot.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000]  There is no evidence of conspiracy by the patriots.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]  We'll be going over that coming up, as I said.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:30.000]  And here's a quick clip back from January that the media has now pushed again of Trump saying if he's reelected as president in 2024,
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]  he will pardon the J6ers.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]  Here it is.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000]  And another thing we'll do, and so many people have been asking me about it,
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.000]  if I run and if I win, we will treat those people from January 6th fairly.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000]  We will treat them fairly.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:57.000]  And if it requires pardons, we will give them pardons, because they are being treated so unfairly.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:12.000]  Meanwhile, JFK Jr., RFK Jr., has come out and said that he would pardon Assange and Snowden.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]  That is something that Trump should have done that Trump didn't do.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000]  And I'm sorry if I'm bumbling a little bit here at the start of the show today.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000]  I got particularly ready for this show.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:31.000]  And sometimes when I really do a ton of research, there's so much going on in my mind that it's just hard for me to even try to collate it all,
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]  much less cover it all.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000]  We're going to do the best job we can today.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000]  Former CIA officer says decision to drone attack criminal was made by the United States.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]  I totally agree with that.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]  And, of course, there's a lot of evidence that shows that.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000]  We'll get into that stack and the incredible escalations there.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000]  Who declares end to COVID global public health emergency?
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:04:01.000]  Also, mental strain, marijuana may be behind a 30 percent increase in schizophrenia in young men, major NIH-funded studies suggest.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]  Well, I don't need studies to know that's true.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.000]  I am not for marijuana criminalization, but I am for decriminalization.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]  I'm not for total legalization.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000]  But I have known so many people that became intense potheads.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000]  And with the new weed that's so strong, they became outright schizophrenics.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:30.000]  Two people that worked here, I guess, synergistically smoked tons of pot together all day.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000]  And I knew both of them, one of them for like 14 years, the other for about six years.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000]  And they both went insane.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000]  I mean, just totally insane for the marijuana.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]  I've got so many other friends and others it's happened to.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000]  Joe Rogan's talked about a lot of his friends that have gone completely schizophrenic on marijuana.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000]  It is a chemical weapon now, basically.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000]  And it's so damn dangerous.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]  But nothing compared to fentanyl.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000]  I'll wait for you to that news, a 279 percent increase in deaths from fentanyl.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]  Please write this down and please go look this up.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]  It will change your life.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000]  The U.N. admits, and the Lansing Medical Journal admits,
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.000]  that upwards of 2 billion people have mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.000]  Most iodine in the environment is bound to other elements so your body can't absorb it.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:38.000]  And Infowarsstore.com has the only iodine out there that actually has this type of full effect.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3's been sold out for six months.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000]  It's very hard to produce.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]  And it's finally back in stock.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is powerful.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]  You and your family need it.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]  It's 25 percent off, back in stock.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000]  X3, triiodine, exclusively at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000]  Take action now.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000]  But regardless, research is info.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:14.000]  Big Brother.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000]  Mainstream media.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000]  Government cover-ups.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:34.000]  Man, we've always got a lot of incredibly important news to cover.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:41.000]  But today it is particularly jam-packed and, quite frankly, horrifying, invigorating, amazing, disgusting.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000]  All points of the compass are covered here.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000]  But I've got to say something.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.000]  I've known for a long time that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been a listener of the show.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000]  And we have the same book publisher as well.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:03.000]  But he said they would use it too much against him politically in spinning things if he did come on the show, and I fully understand that.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:14.000]  But the reason I'm getting more and more behind him is he came out and said the whole global warming system is a scam by megabanks and the ultra-rich,
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000]  like Bill Gates, to take over all of civilization and transfer all wealth to themselves and enslave us.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:27.000]  Now he comes out and says that the globalists are destroying our borders to collapse the United States and bring in slave labor.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000]  He went on to say that he's not anti-immigrant.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]  He's anti-illegal immigration and collapsing the country.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000]  I mean, he just is awesome.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000]  He knows what's going on.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]  Very, very powerful.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:51.000]  Meanwhile, new footage shows El Paso engulfed in mass migration dumpster fire, a state of emergency declared.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000]  A lot of people have asked, why have we been down to the border in the last year?
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:08.000]  Well, Owen Schroer is not allowed to leave Austin, and his pre-sentencing, pre-trial probation officer from January 6 won't let him leave Austin.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000]  They let him leave a couple times a year to go back to Kansas City to see his mom and dad.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000]  And again, Owen was outside the Capitol.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000]  Owen tried to get people to not go into the Capitol, and he's still facing years in prison.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:29.000]  You just saw the setup of the Proud Boys, who in my summation did absolutely nothing.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:36.000]  Certainly nothing compared to the left, and they're now facing 20-plus years in prison with all the charges, something like 35 years in prison.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:46.000]  We've got their lawyers coming on and joining us with the inside baseball of what the feds covered up and the total evidence of the feds being the ones that orchestrated the attack on the Capitol.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000]  That's in about 20 minutes with Norm Patus and others.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000]  So look for that.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000]  We're going to be looking at the incredible footage as Title 42 is about to elapse.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000]  Members of Congress have introduced emergency Title 42 alternative.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000]  It's all part of the U.N. replacement migration operation.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000]  Biden's now acting like he didn't say immediately surge the border.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000]  Biden is now acting like he wants to save us from a collapsed border.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000]  This is just insane.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:24.000]  And the clown that is the White House press secretary said this is an administration that has taken challenges to the border very seriously since day one.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.000]  Mike Pence tells Fox News a storm is coming one week from today.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000]  That was a few days ago, so it is incredible.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.000]  There's hundreds of thousands waiting to get in just at the El Paso crossing alone.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:48.000]  Upwards of 50,000, we're told, by the Border Patrol in the McAllen area and just millions more on their way.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000]  This is beyond dangerous, but we will be going back to the border very, very soon.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000]  I will be going back down to the border.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000]  And I will be covering what's going on.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:04.000]  We're also going to get Drew Hernandez to go with us down there as well and others.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000]  But they're not hiding anymore.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:14.000]  We were down there 15 years ago, 10 years ago, five years ago, and a whole bunch the last two years, two, three years.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000]  It was not getting covered by the national news.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]  Now they're like, oh, there's this giant problem.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:24.000]  Gee, we need more funding to then process and bring the illegals in and flying around the country.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000]  There's so many tens of thousands a day per checkpoint that there's no one to load them on the buses,
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:37.000]  no one to load them on the planes, no one to load them up with all their free gift cards and maps of where to go in the U.S.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000]  to be brought into blue cities.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:45.000]  You've got the blue city mayors in New York and Dallas and Chicago and everywhere bitching and complaining
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000]  and rightfully, in many cases, blaming Biden.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000]  But they're not against the open borders.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000]  They want billions of taxpayer money to now cater to the illegal aliens.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000]  But remember, they don't want them in Martha's Vineyard.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000]  Only 41 of them or 42 of them got shipped there one time, and it was a national emergency.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000]  The rich billionaire globalists.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000]  Why Barack Obama's house is there.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000]  You can't have 41 or what is it, 42 of these people wandering around aimlessly.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000]  They kicked them out of the town and called it humanitarian.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000]  Yeah, not in your backyard, right?
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000]  You've got all that news.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:29.000]  We've got the insanely important news as things have escalated exactly as I said they would.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000]  And I'm not bragging.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000]  I just show I do my research.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]  And when I talk about something geopolitically, I know what I'm talking about.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000]  Or if it's an area I don't know, I'll go research it and tell you I have to reserve comment.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000]  Well, I've had time to research it, but I know exactly what's going on in Russia and Ukraine.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:53.000]  And I told you that they would invade in late February, in October the year before, just a few months before.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000]  And I told you that they were going to start launching more drone attacks inside Russia as a provocation.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000]  They would then claim that it was Russia doing it to itself.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000]  That is exactly what the State Department has now done.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:11.000]  And former top intelligence case officer, analyst, so much more, Larry Johnson has come out
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000]  and basically word for word said what I said about that situation.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000]  The reason that's important is it's not about saying, oh, look, I was right.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000]  It's not just him.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000]  It's a bunch of other experts saying the same thing.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000]  It's that I'm going to tell you what I believe is about to come next.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000]  So that is next segment.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:34.000]  Also, I want to open the phones up in the second and third hour today.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000]  And I want to have a quiz on several topics.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000]  We haven't done this in probably a decade on the show, but I want to bring back quizzes for people
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000]  and see who can answer the question right.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000]  And whoever does answer the question right, give us your address,
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:54.000]  and we'll mail you one of our new T-shirts in the size that you request as a prize.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000]  And we're going to start doing this, I think, every day when we take calls.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000]  Sometimes we'll have multiple prizes, dozens of prizes.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000]  But today we're just going to give out one T-shirt on this question.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000]  So we'll go ahead and throw the question out now, and I'll repose the question next hour.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000]  And then it'll be very informative when we get the answer.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000]  WHO declares an end to COVID global public health emergency.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000]  The question is, why are they doing that?
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:29.000]  I told my wife about a month ago that when you see this, this is what this is going to mean.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000]  So this morning I hadn't seen the story.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000]  I'd missed it somehow, even though I was getting ready for the news.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000]  She got up a little bit earlier than she normally does, about 7 a.m., and said,
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000]  Have you seen this?
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000]  And I said, Yes.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:48.000]  So what does that mean, in my opinion?
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.000]  Is this cause for celebration, or what does this really mean?
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000]  So obviously we'll just take calls until somebody gets the answer.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000]  And I'll give the toll-free number out at the end of this hour when Norm Pettis
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:08.000]  and one of the other proud boy attorneys that's joining us leave us.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000]  It's going to be Norm Pettis and Steve Metcalf.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000]  And this really is going to be a big interview, because obviously I've known what's going on
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000]  the whole time during the trial and before the trial, because I know some of the lawyers.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000]  And I was not at liberty to tell you what was going on,
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000]  because that would give up the sources, and you can't do that during a trial.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000]  I was able to bring out the fact that feds were involved,
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000]  and that they were provocative during the operation.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000]  But now you're going to get to learn what really went on.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000]  We could talk about how it wasn't a fair trial all day, and that's true.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000]  Now it sets the precedent for this to be the model around the country to put people in prison.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:53.000]  And we've got lots of different organizations, like the PETO Project.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:00.000]  I'm sorry, that's the Lincoln Project coming out and calling for my arrest after this,
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000]  and Roger Stone's arrest.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:10.000]  And the guy actually says that I am guilty, that I ran the attack.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:16.000]  I don't have the money and time to sue people like this, but it's preposterous.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000]  I almost went back to the hotel because my wife was freezing.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000]  I didn't want to lead the crowd to the Capitol.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000]  I had no idea there was no security at the Capitol.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000]  You had a space to speak between the Capitol and the Supreme Court.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000]  That's all on record.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000]  I don't go launch violent attacks in the streets.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000]  I don't go riot attack Capitals.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000]  I went and protested in different parts of the country at Capitals with no incident
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000]  in the months before January 6th. Everybody knows that.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000]  And to sit there and preposterously say that I wanted that disaster to happen
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000]  that hurt our country is a pack of lies.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000]  I don't know. If somebody donates the money, I'll fall suit on the guy.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000]  Man, I'm getting sick of hearing these lying pieces of garbage.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000]  Be right back.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:26.000]  The cause of intellectual disability is lack of real, pure iodine in the body
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:32.000]  as they bomb us with the bad halogens, bromine, bromide, chlorine, and so much more.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000]  Upwards of 2 billion people in a Lancet medical journal study in 2007
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.000]  worldwide have cognitive disabilities because they don't have high quality iodine.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000]  Most iodine is bound to other elements. You don't absorb it.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000]  We have X3, all three types of good iodine together that supercharges your body.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000]  X3 is now back in stock at Infowarsstore.com.

[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000]  And it's Turbo Force Plus. We made it even stronger.

[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:17.000]  Turbo Force is back in stock at Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:23.000]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.000]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:36.000]  that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000]  It is the super fuel.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000]  Rain Force Plus is great. Rain Force Ultra is great.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000]  They're two different nootropics. They go good with this.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000]  But this is the King Kong. This is the boss.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000]  Turbo Force back in stock, discounted. Infowarsstore.com.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000]  More power, more strength, more energy.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:05.000]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000]  into the atmosphere. The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.000]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000]  to convert these gases into fluorosilicic acid.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000]  Still highly toxic, but containable.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000]  And there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.000]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the Secretary of the Treasury,
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000]  who was responsible for the public health service at the time.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:41.000]  And by 1950, the U.S. government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste product
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000]  and dumping it into our drinking water.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.000]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000]  And a remedy to this madness.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000]  Available now at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000]  Infowars. Tomorrow's news today.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000]  This is their big move.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000]  So yeah, you say, why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States?
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000]  He doesn't care. That's not his job.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000]  He's not the president of the United States. He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000]  They must be opposed.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000]  Autocrats only understand one word.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000]  No. No. No.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000]  Exactly. And that's why we say no to your vaccines.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000]  We say no to you shutting down our businesses.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000]  We say no to you taking our firearms.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000]  We say no to you censoring our free speech.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000]  We say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000]  We say no to you getting us into World War III.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000]  You're right. We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000]  And we say no. And we say no to your war.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:38.629]  So, two days ago, two drones launched somewhere inside Russia, were launched at the Kremlin
[00:20:38.629 --> 00:20:45.510]  at Vladimir Putin's residence, the equivalent of flying drones into the White House.
[00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:50.429]  They were shot down using electromagnetic weapons.
[00:20:50.429 --> 00:20:59.870]  Now, the Russians don't have a motive in this, and the Ukrainians have been launching attacks
[00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:07.229]  for the last seven months into Western Russia, into the suburbs of Moscow, into Moscow.
[00:21:07.229 --> 00:21:10.310]  They've been blowing people up in their cars, they've been shooting people, they've been
[00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:14.629]  poisoning people, they've been blowing up power plants, they've been sabotaging, and
[00:21:14.629 --> 00:21:15.989]  they've been bragging about it.
[00:21:15.989 --> 00:21:20.350]  And they said, we're going to launch more attacks, we're going to park tanks in Red
[00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:21.949]  Square out front the Kremlin.
[00:21:21.949 --> 00:21:26.070]  That's what their head of their military said two months ago.
[00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:29.870]  And we know Biden bragged, they're going to blow the pipeline up and blew it up.
[00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:33.149]  But the controlled media is so bad in the West, the BBC and others are reporting, as
[00:21:33.149 --> 00:21:37.629]  well as Yahoo News, that they think Putin blew up the pipeline.
[00:21:37.629 --> 00:21:42.709]  With no evidence of that, or pipelines.
[00:21:42.709 --> 00:21:48.510]  This was obviously meant, and I said this on Wednesday in Crowder's studio, and I said
[00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:54.149]  it again yesterday in studio, this is done to push the Russians to escalate so NATO can
[00:21:54.149 --> 00:21:55.909]  officially get in the war.
[00:21:55.909 --> 00:21:59.830]  That's how crazy and what Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said deranged this is.
[00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:04.550]  He said this is incredibly dangerous and is deranged and is insane.
[00:22:04.550 --> 00:22:07.590]  Deranged is the proper word for this, okay?
[00:22:08.989 --> 00:22:14.149]  What would we do if the Russians flew explosive drones into the White House?
[00:22:14.149 --> 00:22:15.629]  We would go completely ape.
[00:22:17.509 --> 00:22:21.709]  So, the new spin is the Russians did this with no evidence.
[00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:26.429]  When the Russians have been trying to de-escalate this to get a peace deal.
[00:22:26.429 --> 00:22:28.669]  That's what they've been saying for nine years.
[00:22:28.669 --> 00:22:31.310]  We've been at war with them for nine years in a proxy war.
[00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:34.310]  Putin was losing a year and a half ago, so he launched this invasion.
[00:22:35.709 --> 00:22:37.629]  Now, I covered all this on Wednesday and Thursday, but
[00:22:37.629 --> 00:22:42.790]  here is a former case officer, top analyst, you name it.
[00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:47.669]  Former CIA officer says decision to drone attack Kremlin was made by the United States.
[00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:52.230]  He goes on to say we know this because the United States is running NATO and
[00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:53.790]  running the attacks, and that's all come out.
[00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:58.509]  I told you US troops were fighting Russians six years ago in Ukraine.
[00:22:59.669 --> 00:23:02.110]  I know troops that have served multiple tours.
[00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:05.230]  I have friends that have been there for years fighting Russians,
[00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:08.509]  killing Russians, and having their friends killed.
[00:23:08.509 --> 00:23:11.350]  They didn't give me the details of the secret operations, but they've been there.
[00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:14.989]  I know a lot of people in the military that have been there.
[00:23:14.989 --> 00:23:17.629]  I've had family that's been there.
[00:23:17.629 --> 00:23:21.070]  Officially in Poland, not in Poland.
[00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:24.350]  I told you that before the war officially started last February.
[00:23:25.909 --> 00:23:27.669]  Year before this February.
[00:23:27.709 --> 00:23:31.790]  So, former CIA officer says decision to drone attack Kremlin
[00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:33.790]  was made by the United States.
[00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:36.790]  Former CIA intelligence officer Larry Johnson says the decision
[00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:39.550]  to launch a drone attack on the Kremlin was made by the United States.
[00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:43.030]  The Wednesday attack, which was likely to have been targeting Russian President
[00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:46.350]  Vladimir Putin, was stopped by electronic warfare systems,
[00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:48.949]  which disabled the drones before they could reach their targets.
[00:23:49.989 --> 00:23:54.030]  According to Johnson, the attack must have been spearheaded by the Biden
[00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:56.830]  administration, the US military industrial complex, because, quote,
[00:23:56.830 --> 00:24:00.350]  decisions on such attacks are made not by Kiev, but by Washington.
[00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:04.550]  Washington should understand clearly that we know this, Johnson told reporters.
[00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:07.110]  Although the attack, which Ukraine denied, was involved, and
[00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:09.310]  it failed to accomplish its tactical goal,
[00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:12.629]  it was still highly symbolic, according to Johnson.
[00:24:12.629 --> 00:24:16.870]  He goes on to say they're trying to trick the Russians into escalating.
[00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:19.350]  Drones over Kremlin likely launched from inside Russia.
[00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:24.830]  US experts say, US Newsreel report, they go on to imply that means the Russians did it.
[00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:29.270]  So when Alexander Dugin's daughter gets blown up, and they try to kill him, or
[00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:32.030]  other reporters get blown up, and other journalists,
[00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:34.989]  because it's launched inside Russia, it means the Russians did it.
[00:24:34.989 --> 00:24:35.669]  Hogwash.
[00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:41.230]  Wagner boss makes major battlefield exit after grisly video.
[00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:44.709]  Says his troops that have been winning the war have no ammo, and
[00:24:44.709 --> 00:24:46.870]  that the general staff are against him.
[00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:48.750]  And so he is pulling his troops out saying,
[00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:51.790]  we are not here to carry out a suicide mission.
[00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:54.709]  Even though 60% of them have been dying with ammunition.
[00:24:56.830 --> 00:24:59.070]  And it goes on from that point.
[00:24:59.070 --> 00:25:02.389]  Terrified Russian men are changing their gender to avoid being sent to war
[00:25:02.389 --> 00:25:03.149]  in Ukraine.
[00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:08.790]  All right, that's the news on that front.
[00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:13.149]  I wanna play a clip from Scott Ritter, former top UN weapons inspector, and
[00:25:13.149 --> 00:25:16.590]  former nuclear arms negotiator with the Russians.
[00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:21.310]  Back in the 1980s and 90s, one of the top experts out there,
[00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:23.949]  he's reporting from Moscow.
[00:25:23.949 --> 00:25:25.389]  Let's go to Scott Ritter.
[00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:31.709]  Hey Alex, this is Scott Ritter, talking to you from Irkutsk, Russia.
[00:25:31.709 --> 00:25:36.429]  Just with a brief comment on the drone attack against
[00:25:36.429 --> 00:25:39.189]  the Kremlin that took place last night.
[00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:46.509]  Right now, the feeling is that this was an attack carried out,
[00:25:46.509 --> 00:25:50.270]  if not directly by Ukraine, definitely on the orders of Ukraine.
[00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:55.709]  And I think Dmitry Medvedev, the former president of Russia,
[00:25:55.709 --> 00:26:00.189]  has said it best, that the Zelensky regime and
[00:26:00.189 --> 00:26:05.429]  Zelensky himself will probably have to be liquidated, which means killed.
[00:26:05.429 --> 00:26:09.509]  Now, some people out there might think that that's a rather harsh response, but
[00:26:09.509 --> 00:26:12.030]  I would ask them to consider in the following.
[00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:16.949]  If there was a hostile actor who had said they plan on attacking
[00:26:16.949 --> 00:26:21.750]  the White House with drones, and then drones attack the White House,
[00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:23.110]  how long do you think it would take for
[00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:25.590]  the United States to eliminate them from the face of the Earth?
[00:26:26.709 --> 00:26:27.989]  The answer is not very long.
[00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:32.989]  So it's a double standard, a little bit of hypocrisy to have a situation where
[00:26:32.989 --> 00:26:39.429]  the Ukrainians say we plan on sending drones to attack Moscow on or
[00:26:39.429 --> 00:26:46.389]  about May 9th, Victory Day, and then a pair of drones arrives in Moscow and
[00:26:46.949 --> 00:26:47.669]  hits the Kremlin.
[00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:53.550]  Ukraine said they were going to do it, it was done, and
[00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:56.830]  now I think the Ukrainians are going to be held fully accountable for it.
[00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:58.350]  How and when this will occur,
[00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:00.790]  it's a decision only the Russian government can make.
[00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:06.629]  But I think Dmitry Medvedev's sentiment is shared widely amongst the Russian people,
[00:27:06.629 --> 00:27:12.189]  and there will be an accounting, and it isn't going to end well for Zelensky.
[00:27:12.189 --> 00:27:16.230]  Again, Alex, thanks for giving me a chance to address this, and
[00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:16.949]  I hope to talk to you soon.
[00:27:19.709 --> 00:27:23.469]  All right, glad that he was able to send us that report.
[00:27:23.469 --> 00:27:25.509]  Thank you, Scott Ritter.
[00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:27.270]  We're going to go to break.
[00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:31.669]  We're going to come back with Norm Pattis and other lawyers from the show trial.
[00:27:31.669 --> 00:27:34.870]  They should send a cold chill up all America's spines for
[00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:36.870]  the total weaponization of the courts.
[00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:38.469]  We have some really good news.
[00:27:38.469 --> 00:27:42.310]  Our number one best-selling product, sold out for more than six months, is back.
[00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:44.750]  It is X3, the deep-earth crystal iodine.
[00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:47.790]  Two other types for better absorption, the studies show.
[00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:49.669]  Up to 2 billion people have cognitive disabilities and
[00:27:49.669 --> 00:27:51.830]  problems because of iodine deficiency.
[00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:54.989]  Most iodine is bound to other elements, so it's not as absorbable or
[00:27:54.989 --> 00:27:58.989]  may not absorb at all, depending on your particular physiology.
[00:27:58.989 --> 00:28:01.909]  So it's very important to use X3.
[00:28:01.909 --> 00:28:04.629]  What it does to your entire cellular system,
[00:28:04.629 --> 00:28:07.149]  every cell in the body is an essential nutrient.
[00:28:07.149 --> 00:28:08.550]  Without it, you die.
[00:28:08.550 --> 00:28:11.669]  And so many of the problems that we see, so much of the sluggishness,
[00:28:11.669 --> 00:28:14.709]  so much of the memory loss, so many of the neurological problems,
[00:28:14.709 --> 00:28:17.469]  the list goes on and on, is lack of iodine.
[00:28:17.469 --> 00:28:21.110]  This is an incredible product, and it funds our operation.
[00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:29.509]  X3, InfoWarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:28:29.509 --> 00:28:33.790]  25% off, back in stock, X3, finally.
[00:28:33.790 --> 00:28:39.310]  Also, TurboForce, back in stock, InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:42.230]  Highest quality, full spectrum CBD oil for your nervous system,
[00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:45.989]  your body, your heart, everything, also your mood.
[00:28:45.989 --> 00:28:49.710]  It's back in stock, InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:53.590]  InfoWarsStore.com, and get a great reset in the War of the World book,
[00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:54.909]  either signed or unsigned as well.
[00:28:54.909 --> 00:28:56.429]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:28:56.429 --> 00:28:57.029]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:02.909]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[00:29:02.909 --> 00:29:05.149]  Please write this down, and please go look this up.
[00:29:05.149 --> 00:29:07.190]  It will change your life.
[00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:10.389]  The UN admits, and the Lancet Medical Journal admits,
[00:29:10.389 --> 00:29:13.949]  that upwards of 2 billion people have mental disabilities
[00:29:13.949 --> 00:29:15.949]  and declining cognitive abilities.
[00:29:15.949 --> 00:29:21.270]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:25.029]  Most iodine in the environment is bound to other elements
[00:29:25.029 --> 00:29:26.909]  so your body can't absorb it.
[00:29:26.909 --> 00:29:31.429]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[00:29:31.429 --> 00:29:35.149]  And InfoWarsStore.com has the only iodine out there
[00:29:35.149 --> 00:29:38.549]  that actually has this type of full effect.
[00:29:38.549 --> 00:29:41.590]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3's been sold out for six months.
[00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:45.149]  It's very hard to produce, and it's finally back in stock.
[00:29:45.149 --> 00:29:47.469]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[00:29:47.469 --> 00:29:49.710]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is powerful.
[00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:51.070]  You and your family need it.
[00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:53.149]  It's 25% off back in stock.
[00:29:53.149 --> 00:29:57.469]  X3, try iodine exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:29:57.469 --> 00:30:01.429]  Take action now, but regardless, research is info.
[00:30:01.429 --> 00:30:04.909]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[00:30:04.909 --> 00:30:06.830]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:10.830]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:12.549]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars,
[00:30:12.549 --> 00:30:16.190]  people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:19.710]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:21.830]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer
[00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:24.270]  and the hard work they engage in every day,
[00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:28.509]  five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[00:30:28.509 --> 00:30:30.190]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew,
[00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:32.149]  I thank you for your past support.
[00:30:32.149 --> 00:30:33.830]  I only encourage you now to realize
[00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:37.949]  that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[00:30:37.949 --> 00:30:38.949]  I know you spread the word.
[00:30:38.949 --> 00:30:40.429]  I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful.
[00:30:40.429 --> 00:30:41.270]  Keep doing it.
[00:30:41.270 --> 00:30:45.149]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com
[00:30:45.149 --> 00:30:46.469]  and you never buy great products
[00:30:46.469 --> 00:30:48.070]  that enrich and empower your life
[00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:49.909]  while at the same time keeping us on air.
[00:30:49.909 --> 00:30:51.790]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners
[00:30:51.790 --> 00:30:54.190]  actually go buy products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:56.270]  If just 1% more of you took action
[00:30:56.270 --> 00:30:57.750]  and went to InfoWarsStore.com,
[00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:59.149]  our funding problems will be over.
[00:30:59.149 --> 00:31:00.429]  Please take action now.
[00:31:00.429 --> 00:31:03.350]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world
[00:31:03.389 --> 00:31:05.429]  that the globalists were gonna move against Tucker Carlson
[00:31:05.429 --> 00:31:06.429]  and take him off the air.
[00:31:06.429 --> 00:31:09.070]  People said, no way, he's the most popular ever happened.
[00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:11.230]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:12.509]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air
[00:31:12.509 --> 00:31:13.830]  because they believe they can control him.
[00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:15.710]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't,
[00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:17.029]  he was taken off the air.
[00:31:17.029 --> 00:31:18.790]  It's the same thing with InfoWars.
[00:31:18.790 --> 00:31:21.350]  But InfoWars is not owned by Fox
[00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:22.710]  or controlled by George Soros
[00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:25.389]  or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[00:31:25.389 --> 00:31:29.190]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:31.230]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[00:31:31.270 --> 00:31:35.909]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[00:31:35.909 --> 00:31:39.669]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[00:31:39.669 --> 00:31:40.949]  So I wanna thank you for your support
[00:31:40.949 --> 00:31:42.790]  and encourage viewers and listeners to understand,
[00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:45.389]  please don't take InfoWars for granted.
[00:31:45.389 --> 00:31:46.750]  We're barely hanging on.
[00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:48.590]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer,
[00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:49.710]  your financial support,
[00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:51.429]  while getting great products at the same time
[00:31:51.429 --> 00:31:52.509]  at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:31:52.509 --> 00:31:55.230]  So don't procrastinate, go to InfoWarsStore.com,
[00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:57.190]  get amazing products that keep us on the air
[00:31:57.190 --> 00:31:59.669]  and never submit to these tyrants.
[00:32:00.629 --> 00:32:04.949]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners
[00:32:04.949 --> 00:32:06.629]  that have gone to InfoWarsStore.com
[00:32:06.629 --> 00:32:09.149]  and gotten the great products that enrich your life,
[00:32:09.149 --> 00:32:11.310]  that empower your immune system and your body
[00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:12.509]  and keep us on air.
[00:32:12.509 --> 00:32:15.190]  I am humbly, hand in hand,
[00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:16.389]  talking to the viewers and listeners
[00:32:16.389 --> 00:32:18.909]  that have tuned in, many of you for years,
[00:32:18.909 --> 00:32:20.909]  and never gone to InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:32:20.909 --> 00:32:24.389]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you
[00:32:24.389 --> 00:32:26.590]  never actually go to InfoWarsStore.com
[00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:28.389]  and never experience these great products
[00:32:28.549 --> 00:32:29.909]  and never find the operation.
[00:32:29.909 --> 00:32:31.750]  Sure, you share a link, you share an article,
[00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:32.949]  you tell folks about the show.
[00:32:32.949 --> 00:32:34.310]  That's great, and I thank you.
[00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:35.870]  But we need funds to operate.
[00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:37.629]  Plus, we've got really great products
[00:32:37.629 --> 00:32:38.830]  that do amazing things for people,
[00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:41.310]  like our CBD oil and our Fizzy Magnesium
[00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:43.230]  and our Sleep Aid and our Nitric Oxide
[00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:44.190]  and our Real Red Pill.
[00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:46.310]  Plus, all of these are really great products
[00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:47.149]  that keep us on air.
[00:32:47.149 --> 00:32:48.909]  Plus, you're missing out on having these products.
[00:32:48.909 --> 00:32:50.989]  So get off the bench, get in the game,
[00:32:50.989 --> 00:32:54.870]  step to the plate, and go to InfoWarsStore.com right now
[00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:56.870]  and get these great InfoWars products
[00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:58.149]  at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:32:58.389 --> 00:32:59.230]  Thank you.
[00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:37.340]  I warned everyone with the Sandy Hook show trials that were totally rigorous, found guilty
[00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:43.020]  by the judges, and the juries were told to find me guilty, guilty until proven more guilty,
[00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:46.820]  that it was a beta test to take everybody else out, and now they admit that with Fox
[00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:47.820]  News.
[00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:52.419]  Well, Norm Paz is one of the main lawyers on the nearly five-month trial there in the
[00:33:52.419 --> 00:33:53.419]  District of Mordor.
[00:33:53.419 --> 00:33:57.139]  First, they came for Alex Jones, and you cheered because you disagreed with him.
[00:33:57.139 --> 00:34:00.899]  Then they came for the Proud Boys because you cheered because you disagreed with them.
[00:34:00.899 --> 00:34:04.340]  Then they came for Donald Trump, and you cheered because you disagreed with him.
[00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:06.980]  Then they came for you.
[00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:12.500]  And that is exactly what has happened, riffing off the famous pastor that said, first they
[00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:15.500]  came for the trade unionists, and I wasn't a trade unionist, so I said nothing.
[00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:19.580]  Then they came for the communists, I wasn't a communist, so I said nothing.
[00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:22.299]  Then they came for the Jews, I wasn't Jewish, so I said nothing.
[00:34:22.299 --> 00:34:26.220]  Then they came for me, and there was no one left to stand up for me.
[00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:29.460]  Now we may have to hold these guys a little bit in the next hour, or we may have to skip
[00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:33.340]  this next break, because I want them to really drill in and say what can be said now that
[00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:38.560]  was secret in the trial, that the judge didn't want you to know, that they had feds there
[00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:39.819]  helping break into the building.
[00:34:39.819 --> 00:34:44.700]  They had feds inside the Proud Boys trying to provocateur them, and CIA-connected operatives,
[00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:49.540]  and sex operatives, and that none of this was ever allowed to be shown to the jury.
[00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:54.060]  And that's why there were so many days where they would shut down the jury, and then the
[00:34:54.060 --> 00:35:00.020]  judge would kick the media out and explain, you're not going to bring forward any of this
[00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:01.020]  information.
[00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:06.340]  There's a big article about it on gatewaypundit.com, J6 political prisoner Dominic Pozzola's attorney.
[00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:08.819]  Evidence confirms J6 was an organized government plot.
[00:35:08.819 --> 00:35:12.100]  There is no evidence of conspiracy by the patriots.
[00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:16.620]  But here, before I go to the lawyers, is the Lincoln Project founder, calls for Alex Jones,
[00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:19.220]  Roger Stone, Steve Manin, and Donald Trump to be arrested.
[00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:22.100]  And he says that we ran the attack.
[00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:23.460]  No, I didn't.
[00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:25.420]  I protested at dozens of capitals.
[00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:28.740]  I had rallies with 500,000 people the month before in D.C.
[00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:30.500]  I've never attacked people at rallies.
[00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:33.980]  I don't believe in offensive violence, and I have no history of that, and I tried to
[00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:35.500]  stop people going in the building.
[00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:36.980]  And how dare you?
[00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:42.779]  How dare you imply that I ordered and commanded this?
[00:35:42.779 --> 00:35:45.740]  That is outrageous, and you know it's not true.
[00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:50.500]  And I'm not a litigious person, but man, at a certain point, I got to start suing people.
[00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:53.259]  This is outrageous.
[00:35:53.259 --> 00:35:54.259]  Absolutely outrageous.
[00:35:54.259 --> 00:35:59.740]  Norm Pattis was my criminal lawyer on this when I was deposed by Congress and the J6
[00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:00.980]  kangaroo committee.
[00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:06.500]  He went through all my phones, all my emails, interviewed my staff, and he said, you aren't
[00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:07.900]  just somebody that tried to stop it.
[00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:08.900]  You were a hero.
[00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:12.420]  I'm not saying I was a hero, but the point is I went into the tear gas to try to stop
[00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:16.580]  the situation because it was a disaster for our country and let them demonize the American
[00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:17.580]  people as terrorists.
[00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:22.620]  Here's a short clip of the Lincoln Project founder defaming me and saying he wants me
[00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:27.700]  – he's not just lying to hurt me or put me out of business or take me off the air.
[00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:30.660]  He wants me behind bars for decades.
[00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:31.660]  Here it is.
[00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:33.660]  It runs up, not down.
[00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:40.420]  Yes, they've arrested a bunch of these like lower tier J6 who also deserve to be charged,
[00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:44.740]  deserve to be punished, and these guys deserve to be charged and punished too.
[00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:48.980]  They're only a little higher up the food chain though, and the important thing here is that
[00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:54.020]  the food chain doesn't just go from the J6 guys to the Proud Boys.
[00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:55.020]  It goes up.
[00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:56.020]  It goes up from there.
[00:36:56.020 --> 00:37:02.540]  It's a lair of people like Roger Stone and Alex Jones and Steve Bannon.
[00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:07.620]  These guys are too dumb to understand how to do things without getting orders.
[00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:08.620]  They're street thugs.
[00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:09.940]  They're chaos agents.
[00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:12.779]  They were ordered and requested to do this and they agreed.
[00:37:12.779 --> 00:37:14.860]  It was a conspiracy to do so.
[00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:17.299]  That conspiracy needs to go up, not down.
[00:37:17.299 --> 00:37:19.220]  And the top of the conspiracy is Donald Trump.
[00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:21.540]  Jack Smith, I hope you're doing your job, buddy.
[00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:22.540]  But today's a good day.
[00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:23.540]  See ya.
[00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:31.380]  Today's a good day to accuse me of orchestrating that fiasco.
[00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:34.259]  I wasn't Ray Epps out there days before saying attack the Capitol.
[00:37:34.259 --> 00:37:38.500]  I didn't testify to Congress that I sent text messages like Ray Epps did saying he quote
[00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:39.500]  orchestrated it.
[00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:41.140]  I didn't help ram signs over the police.
[00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:44.500]  I went and tried to work with the police to get on their speaker systems that they wouldn't
[00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:48.460]  use to tell people get the hell out of the Capitol before Ashley Bannon died.
[00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:50.259]  Norm, I'm ranching.
[00:37:50.259 --> 00:37:54.340]  I want to give you the floor and Steve Metcalf, one of the other great lawyers that took on
[00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:56.540]  this rigged case.
[00:37:56.540 --> 00:38:02.220]  I know you fought like the devil to try to tell the jury the truth, but were stopped.
[00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:06.220]  So you can lead this here, Norm, but I really want to get into all the stuff that I was
[00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:10.020]  told by sources that I brought to you that you said you would later be able to talk
[00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:13.779]  about with this really being evidence of how this was orchestrated.
[00:38:13.779 --> 00:38:16.660]  So Norm Pattis, start wherever you'd like, my friend.
[00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:19.540]  There was no conspiracy.
[00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:21.580]  There was no plot.
[00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:28.500]  There was no implicit understanding among anyone to do anything of the sort on January
[00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:32.740]  6th among the Proud Boys or as near as I can tell anyone else.
[00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:38.259]  And the United States government knows it because when they argued in closing arguments in this
[00:38:38.259 --> 00:38:43.460]  case, they said the conspiracy may have been formed instantaneously, that conduct reflected
[00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:45.300]  this understanding.
[00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:48.180]  Here's what happened in the January 6 trial.
[00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:51.740]  Whether rightly or wrongly, Donald Trump believed the election was stolen.
[00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:54.380]  He got 70 million American votes.
[00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:56.100]  He wanted to stop the steal.
[00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:57.940]  He turned a lawful process.
[00:38:57.940 --> 00:39:01.340]  He wanted people to turn up at the Capitol to protest.
[00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:02.980]  He urged them to do so.
[00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:08.840]  And from the ellipse outside the White House that day, he directed people to the Capitol.
[00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:14.819]  It was an angry crowd because the commander in chief said the election was stolen.
[00:39:14.819 --> 00:39:16.180]  Stop the steal.
[00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:19.500]  These people went to the Capitol and a match was lit.
[00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:21.100]  And we don't know who lit it.
[00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:23.460]  There's Ray Epps who's never going to be charged.
[00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:25.860]  Some people say the government did it, Alex.
[00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:27.660]  I don't see evidence of that.
[00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:29.420]  But here's what I saw at the trial.
[00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:33.220]  And I don't mean to hog the stage from my colleague, Mr. Metcalf, who I'm introducing
[00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:38.140]  you folks to today, a brilliant lawyer, young man who I hope to know for many years to come.
[00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:40.259]  But here's what happened as near as I could tell.
[00:39:40.259 --> 00:39:43.380]  And here's what we can talk about at the trial and what we can't.
[00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:47.980]  And this is a note to Jim Jordan, if you're watching, get that weaponization committee
[00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:54.020]  to subpoena the trial transcripts in this case, all of them, including the transcripts
[00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:55.580]  that are under seal.
[00:39:55.580 --> 00:40:01.100]  Because Steve and I are still prohibited from speaking about what we heard in closed proceedings.
[00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:07.380]  But what we can say, at least what I can believe I can fairly say, is the government fought
[00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:11.220]  to prevent the truth from being presented at that trial.
[00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:18.940]  And the truth is that the FBI has a program in which they register confidential human
[00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:24.819]  sources that are engaged or embedded within or are reporting on domestic groups.
[00:40:24.819 --> 00:40:27.620]  And they keep that as a closely held secret.
[00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:29.740]  They keep it secret from prosecutors.
[00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:31.620]  They keep it secret from the courts.
[00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:34.180]  They keep it secret from other investigators.
[00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:37.540]  And it's only accessed on a need to know basis.
[00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:40.259]  And so we wanted all that information.
[00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:42.140]  We were prohibited that information.
[00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:48.220]  Instead, the government folded and as a compromise gave us a stipulation there were at least
[00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:54.500]  eight, maybe more confidential sources reporting to the FBI on the Proud Boys from the election
[00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:58.380]  of 2020 through January 6th of 2021.
[00:40:58.380 --> 00:41:03.540]  We use that to argue to the jury that don't you think if the FBI had its knuckle draggers
[00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:07.860]  in the group and there was some conspiracy, somebody would have reported something.
[00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:10.980]  Well, they didn't report anything because there was nothing there.
[00:41:11.259 --> 00:41:18.180]  So in this trial, in this historic trial, the text messages of patriots who were upset about
[00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:22.700]  what was going on in this country were used to prove that when they went to an event that
[00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:24.819]  turned into a riot, they planned the riot.
[00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:26.660]  Alex, excuse my language.
[00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:27.340]  Excuse this.
[00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:28.580]  I know it's a family show.
[00:41:28.779 --> 00:41:34.460]  If that is pure and utter bullshit and the United States government knows it.
[00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:39.259]  And so for these people on the Lincoln Project to sit back and say, oh, Alex should be
[00:41:39.259 --> 00:41:42.300]  prosecuted. Oh, Roger Stone should be prosecuted.
[00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:46.900]  I've been up one side of your communications and down the other for years.
[00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:49.580]  I've gotten to know everyone in your organization.
[00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:51.140]  I've gotten to know you.
[00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:53.500]  I've sat through a four and a half month trial.
[00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:56.380]  I've reviewed the trial transcripts of the Oath Keepers.
[00:41:56.500 --> 00:42:01.140]  There is there's about as much evidence that you were involved in planning this as there
[00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:02.540]  was the Lincoln Project.
[00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:09.340]  And so that is an utterly irresponsible and defamatory accusation by a thug in a car.
[00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:14.060]  And what that thug wants to do is he wants to put a thumb on free speech and say, if you
[00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:15.620]  agree with me, you can talk.
[00:42:15.779 --> 00:42:20.140]  But if you petition for redress of grievance and something goes wrong, you're going to go
[00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:22.779]  to prison. Absolutely chilling day, Alex.
[00:42:22.779 --> 00:42:24.900]  Absolutely chilling day in American jurisprudence.
[00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:27.580]  I was so devastated after the verdict last night.
[00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:30.460]  So angry, humiliated, disturbed, depressed.
[00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:34.380]  I just came and sat in my room all evening and went out later in the evening to have a
[00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:35.420]  couple of drinks with Steve.
[00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:40.779]  But it was a total, total disaster for people who believe in freedom of speech.
[00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:46.180]  And I do believe prosecutors have discretion about what to charge and what not to
[00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:51.180]  charge. First, they came for you with deplatforming and this bogus Sandy Hook thing.
[00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:56.140]  Then they came for the Proud Boys and they got you and they got the Proud Boys.
[00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:57.300]  And next it'll be Trump.
[00:42:57.580 --> 00:43:00.819]  And when they've run out of enemies, it's going to come it's going to come down to the
[00:43:00.819 --> 00:43:02.420]  people who supported all of you.
[00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:04.740]  And you need to fight back now.
[00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:08.940]  Norm, introduce Steve Metcalf to us.
[00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:11.460]  Steve Metcalf, I had the pleasure of meeting.
[00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:12.700]  He's from New York and Baltimore.
[00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:14.300]  He represented Dominic Pozzola.
[00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:18.380]  Pozzola was the fellow you saw on films using a shield to break a window.
[00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:22.340]  Pozzola was the only Proud Boy to be acquitted of seditious conspiracy.
[00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:25.500]  That was an enormous accomplishment for Mr.
[00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:28.060]  Metcalf. But Steve is a he's a street fighter.
[00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:29.420]  He's a lifelong friend.
[00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:30.859]  I spent four and a half months with him.
[00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:33.580]  You ask us about Nigel and Rupert a little later.
[00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:34.779]  Alex, here's Steve.
[00:43:34.779 --> 00:43:36.700]  Steve, what do you think happened at that trial?
[00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:41.819]  Well, I got the pleasure to sit next to Norm every single day.
[00:43:41.819 --> 00:43:43.060]  I learned a lot from him.
[00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:45.859]  We we tried to make the best of it.
[00:43:45.859 --> 00:43:50.300]  We tried to have fun. We tried to laugh, even during some of the darkest times.
[00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:55.980]  And when I mean the darkest times, Alex, they literally took private messages from
[00:43:55.980 --> 00:44:00.020]  these these individuals, their most deepest messages.
[00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:01.940]  I'm talking about one of the defendants.
[00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:04.940]  His messages to his mother were displayed for the jury.
[00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:09.580]  It was it was disgusting how far they went and how much they cherry picked to put
[00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:14.660]  together some sort of orchestrated scenario that never actually made sense.
[00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:19.859]  Still to this day, I was able to stand up in front of the jury and talk about the
[00:44:19.859 --> 00:44:22.740]  timeline. What timeline are we even talking about?
[00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:25.620]  When did this conspiracy even start?
[00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:28.740]  When did this conspiracy come to fruition?
[00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:31.300]  Who was even a part of this conspiracy?
[00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:32.660]  There was there was nothing.
[00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:36.859]  All these questions were not answered by the by the U.S.
[00:44:36.859 --> 00:44:43.819]  government. And still somehow, some way, they convinced this jury and have convinced
[00:44:43.859 --> 00:44:49.460]  people for months that there's this there was this grandiose scheme that was
[00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:57.859]  conducted by Theriot or involved Theriot somehow as the leader that is almost
[00:44:57.859 --> 00:45:03.859]  mind-blowing. I compared it to, in my closing, I said it was fairy dust, that it
[00:45:03.859 --> 00:45:07.300]  was a fairytale story that does not exist.
[00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:13.140]  I wanted to compare it to a Disney show or to something that Steven Spielberg could
[00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:14.900]  write, because it was that bizarre.
[00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:20.540]  I mean, in fact, we are I argue that the government was, you know, Alex, a lot of
[00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:23.380]  people rain on your parade saying you're a conspiracy theorist.
[00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:26.900]  The real conspiracy theorist in this case was the United States government.
[00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:31.660]  They took isolated strands of evidence and stitched it into a narrative and sold it
[00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:33.300]  as a conspiracy against the right.
[00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:36.900]  And the Lincoln Project's running with it, trying to up the ante in the next round of
[00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:38.779]  indictments. I didn't mean to cut you off, Steven.
[00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:40.819]  That's fine. I did it all trial.
[00:45:40.819 --> 00:45:42.340]  Well, why should today be any different?
[00:45:42.460 --> 00:45:48.660]  That's what I, Alex, I saw this coming from a mile away and I, even before I met
[00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:53.779]  Norm, I did everything I possibly could to distance Dominic Pozzolo from everybody I
[00:45:53.779 --> 00:45:58.940]  possibly could. And I was able to effectively do that just enough to get him out of this
[00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:01.779]  group and in front of this jury panel, D.C.
[00:46:01.779 --> 00:46:04.500]  jury panel. I mean, that was my next question.
[00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:08.180]  What is wrong with D.C., New York and Austin juries?
[00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:10.859]  They're known to be the most San Francisco's almost as bad.
[00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:12.819]  But all the lawyers I've talked to say D.C.
[00:46:12.819 --> 00:46:20.420]  is the worst. Then New York, then Austin, Texas, then San Francisco, then some areas of
[00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:25.980]  Connecticut. I mean, these people will convict a newborn baby of mass murder.
[00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:28.220]  How are they able to do this?
[00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:33.020]  You know, they go ahead.
[00:46:33.140 --> 00:46:37.740]  We fought like cats and dogs just to get the case transferred out of D.C.
[00:46:37.819 --> 00:46:41.859]  Nobody's won that fight, Alex, with regards to January 6 cases.
[00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:43.620]  So now we're in D.C.
[00:46:43.779 --> 00:46:48.500]  on a political case where they vote 92 percent Democrat.
[00:46:50.540 --> 00:46:54.420]  Absolutely, I think that the numbers are even higher than 92 percent.
[00:46:54.620 --> 00:47:00.700]  Now, Alex, we spent over two weeks trying to pick this jury and these potential jurors
[00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:06.300]  were coming into court saying that their preconceived notions of the Proud Boys were
[00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:10.220]  that they were white supremacists, that they were racist.
[00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:14.460]  We would flag this for the court every single time.
[00:47:14.819 --> 00:47:19.980]  And without fail, the judge would let them be a prospective juror.
[00:47:20.260 --> 00:47:23.580]  And then we only had 12 preemptory challenges.
[00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:25.220]  Norm, you remember that whole battle?
[00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:27.020]  I do. I moved.
[00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:32.900]  I made a motion that I wanted additional preemptory challenges for every defendant because
[00:47:32.900 --> 00:47:35.460]  we only had 12 preemptory challenges.
[00:47:35.460 --> 00:47:38.900]  The judge gave us two more for five defendants.
[00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:42.260]  I got up on I got I made a written motion, Alex.
[00:47:42.740 --> 00:47:48.180]  By the time I got up to the podium, I was so disgusted at what I saw.
[00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:53.500]  And the select committee was going on at the same time, making the same allegations about
[00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:55.779]  Trump and that they were going to come to this this.
[00:47:56.340 --> 00:48:01.060]  It's on every TV channel saying they're white supremacists and terrorists in the same
[00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:02.060]  town. Here's the deal.
[00:48:02.580 --> 00:48:03.580]  They're they're not.
[00:48:03.819 --> 00:48:07.340]  I mean, I've gotten to know you know, I've got I got to know these guys.
[00:48:07.819 --> 00:48:11.260]  We sat with them for months, half a year in court proceedings.
[00:48:11.420 --> 00:48:15.220]  We've we've read hundreds of thousands of text messages, emails.
[00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:17.260]  I've read every book I can find on this.
[00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:21.620]  When you pick up the paper, they're a group of white white supremacists, extremists.
[00:48:21.779 --> 00:48:24.819]  When I talk to them, they're my next door neighbor and they're wondering what the hell's
[00:48:24.819 --> 00:48:28.140]  going on in this country. Most of the people who joined the Proud Boys.
[00:48:28.180 --> 00:48:32.020]  Well, let's not most many who joined the Proud Boys and who testified at trial talked
[00:48:32.020 --> 00:48:34.500]  about how they were radicalized in the summer of 2020.
[00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:36.260]  Everybody was locked down for covid.
[00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:38.620]  Their businesses were suffering and struggling.
[00:48:38.620 --> 00:48:42.180]  And on television, while they're told to stay home or mask up when they go to the
[00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:47.300]  grocery store, they see people in mostly peaceful protests downtown and they see their
[00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:51.460]  communities going up in smoke and they see people who think like them being attacked
[00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:53.340]  by a mob and police did nothing.
[00:48:53.580 --> 00:48:55.779]  They thought the American dream was better than that.
[00:48:55.779 --> 00:48:58.380]  They thought the First Amendment guaranteed the protection of all.
[00:48:58.500 --> 00:49:02.500]  Many of them were former military guys and they decided they'd protect the downtrodden.
[00:49:02.620 --> 00:49:05.380]  In this case, the downtrodden were not part of the woke mob.
[00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:06.380]  So let me look at that.
[00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:07.540]  Let me raise this.
[00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:11.260]  And I know I have sources, the same sources around you.
[00:49:11.779 --> 00:49:12.900]  You were very tight lipped.
[00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:14.180]  I would call you about intel.
[00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:16.260]  I got you'd say, well, that's pretty much what we're seeing.
[00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:17.660]  But I can't talk until this is over.
[00:49:17.940 --> 00:49:18.900]  Now you're saying you can't.
[00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:23.940]  But what about how the judge would not let the evidence that they had informants in
[00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:29.020]  the group and the informants were testifying and in the reports to the FBI, they were not
[00:49:29.020 --> 00:49:30.940]  planning this. I mean, I knew the Proud Boys.
[00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:33.420]  They were there in case Antifa attack people.
[00:49:33.620 --> 00:49:35.859]  That was their only plan is what I heard about.
[00:49:36.020 --> 00:49:37.980]  There was no plan to attack the Capitol.
[00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:42.900]  I know once it was tear gas and police and provocateurs that weren't them attacking
[00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:45.740]  the police that they started having scuffles with them.
[00:49:46.580 --> 00:49:48.740]  OK, that's a year or two in jail if you don't hurt a cop.
[00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:50.300]  But no cops were killed.
[00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:51.500]  They lied about that as well.
[00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:53.540]  No cops were killed. They lied about that as well.
[00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:57.380]  So so I was not expecting this because we've never been violent anywhere else.
[00:49:57.580 --> 00:49:59.620]  They'd not been offensively violent anywhere else.
[00:49:59.620 --> 00:50:04.060]  So what can both of you say about what the judge suppressed from the jury?
[00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:11.020]  The we had to fight out very, very hard to even open the door to confidential
[00:50:11.020 --> 00:50:16.220]  informants or confidential sources, we were able to name three of them.
[00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:21.060]  We weren't able to name five of them to to the in this case.
[00:50:21.180 --> 00:50:23.660]  We weren't able to find out how many there were.
[00:50:24.260 --> 00:50:29.260]  There continued to be disclosures during trial, including late in trial, that not
[00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:35.180]  just the FBI, but the Metro Department in Washington, D.C.
[00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:37.060]  had informants in the Proud Boys.
[00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:40.500]  One of Mr. Metcalf's colleagues, Mr.
[00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:45.380]  Roots, made a motion for disclosure of other agents within the federal government
[00:50:45.819 --> 00:50:50.220]  broadly conceived that were involved in the Proud Boys.
[00:50:50.220 --> 00:50:54.700]  And and the judge basically I think the court's conclusion was, well, there's just
[00:50:54.700 --> 00:50:56.819]  too many government agencies for us to know.
[00:50:56.939 --> 00:50:58.460]  You've got to be more specific.
[00:50:58.580 --> 00:51:00.300]  And I didn't say anything at this point.
[00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:02.660]  But in my mind, I'm thinking, what the fuck?
[00:51:02.980 --> 00:51:03.980]  Excuse my language.
[00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:08.420]  This is the United States of America versus the Proud Boys versus our clients.
[00:51:08.620 --> 00:51:10.060]  That's what the caption read.
[00:51:10.140 --> 00:51:13.500]  And you're telling me that party can't tell us what it's doing.
[00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:16.500]  Steve, do you have any comments about what the judge suppressed?
[00:51:17.460 --> 00:51:23.060]  I do. Alex, we had a little binder that had probably about 100 pages in it, and it was
[00:51:23.060 --> 00:51:24.300]  a CHS binder.
[00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:28.779]  Now, in this binder, we could not know people's identification.
[00:51:28.939 --> 00:51:30.460]  We could not know their names.
[00:51:30.740 --> 00:51:35.540]  We could not know a lot of different scenarios because of all the heavily redacted
[00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:37.740]  documents that were contained in this binder.
[00:51:37.899 --> 00:51:41.300]  We could not discuss this with our own clients, still can't discuss this with our own
[00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:44.540]  clients. When we would find out something throughout the course of the trial and
[00:51:44.540 --> 00:51:47.660]  bring it to the judge's attention, all of a sudden a whole team from the government
[00:51:47.660 --> 00:51:51.420]  would show up and figure out a way to stonewall the situation.
[00:51:51.420 --> 00:51:52.460]  Steve, tell them what happened.
[00:51:52.460 --> 00:51:54.859]  It's not. Steve, tell them what there are so many informants in this case.
[00:51:54.859 --> 00:51:57.140]  Tell them what happened when Carmen started cross examining.
[00:51:57.580 --> 00:51:59.580]  And even the government didn't know the guy was a CHS.
[00:51:59.620 --> 00:52:03.700]  Remember that? That's just one of the many.
[00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:05.220]  Alex, let me tell you this.
[00:52:05.580 --> 00:52:13.460]  If Norm or I wanted to mention the word CHS or anything about these individuals, we had
[00:52:13.460 --> 00:52:16.859]  to ask for permission in front of the jury.
[00:52:17.020 --> 00:52:22.580]  We had to go separately to the phone and ask for permission to be able to raise one
[00:52:22.580 --> 00:52:25.620]  question about it. Norm actually did it first.
[00:52:25.620 --> 00:52:27.340]  I'll never forget the way Norm did it.
[00:52:28.180 --> 00:52:32.460]  He actually was crossing a witness and said, judge, we got to step to the phones.
[00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:37.660]  And then that was the first time that the jury heard about there being CHS in one
[00:52:37.660 --> 00:52:42.980]  particular instance. But yes, there were times, Alex, that we were talking about an
[00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:46.980]  individual that nobody on the defense side even knew was a CHS.
[00:52:47.140 --> 00:52:48.700]  And then we were finding that out.
[00:52:48.939 --> 00:52:50.859]  One of our own witnesses, we found out.
[00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:56.020]  There was another attorney, another, the attorneys from Florida who represented
[00:52:56.020 --> 00:53:03.140]  Terrio, had one of their first witnesses the day before they were supposed to take the
[00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:09.620]  stand and testify, found out or were disclosed that that person was a CHS.
[00:53:09.859 --> 00:53:10.939]  Were you able to bring up?
[00:53:10.939 --> 00:53:12.060]  I mean, I know you guys tried.
[00:53:12.060 --> 00:53:13.300]  Well, what about Ray Epps?
[00:53:13.460 --> 00:53:16.140]  I mean, he says go into the Capitol the day before the day.
[00:53:16.140 --> 00:53:19.740]  He's there helping ram signs in the first breach over the police.
[00:53:19.939 --> 00:53:25.939]  He tells the J6 kangaroo committee that he, quote, orchestrated the the attack to send
[00:53:25.939 --> 00:53:28.100]  his text messages, bragging to family about it.
[00:53:28.340 --> 00:53:32.819]  How the hell is he not arrested or indicted and is now a victim, according to the
[00:53:32.819 --> 00:53:38.779]  media? Alex, you got to look even further right there at that scene right there where
[00:53:38.779 --> 00:53:41.020]  you see the guy with the red hat, Ryan Samso.
[00:53:41.020 --> 00:53:42.939]  Ray Epps goes up to him right there.
[00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:45.740]  Seconds after that, the first gate start.
[00:53:45.779 --> 00:53:47.100]  That's the first breach.
[00:53:47.779 --> 00:53:52.060]  Then they go up all these stairs and they're in the they're in the.
[00:53:54.180 --> 00:54:01.300]  The yard right outside of the plaza, the lower west side, and you see one you see
[00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:06.819]  Dominic Pizzolo, my client there, Ray Epps comes to him and is speaking to him.
[00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:12.700]  This is moments before people start getting shot with rubber bullets from an elevated
[00:54:12.700 --> 00:54:16.980]  position. Ray Epps is all over the place there.
[00:54:16.980 --> 00:54:22.939]  I can't tell you how many times we would be dissecting a video in court and out of
[00:54:22.939 --> 00:54:25.660]  nowhere, Ray Epps happens to be right in the middle of it.
[00:54:25.939 --> 00:54:26.939]  No, and here's something.
[00:54:26.939 --> 00:54:29.020]  Yeah, here's something that's very interesting, Alex.
[00:54:29.020 --> 00:54:32.140]  In our fights with the government about confidential informants, they would always
[00:54:32.140 --> 00:54:36.700]  take the position we can neither confirm nor deny that this person is a confidential
[00:54:36.700 --> 00:54:39.899]  informant. And from that, we were supposed to take that they weren't, because if they
[00:54:39.899 --> 00:54:41.700]  were, we would be entitled to know about it.
[00:54:41.859 --> 00:54:44.140]  And so this was their position with regard to Epps.
[00:54:44.140 --> 00:54:45.500]  We can't confirm it or deny it.
[00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:51.260]  But if your viewers or you watch the 60 minute piece, they came out and denied that Epps
[00:54:51.260 --> 00:54:54.300]  was a CIA in violation of their own stated policies.
[00:54:54.420 --> 00:54:56.980]  So they went way out of their way to protect this guy.
[00:54:57.020 --> 00:55:00.380]  I mean, watching watching the footage and I've looked at a lot of you looked at more of
[00:55:00.380 --> 00:55:03.060]  it. It's like he's he's he's the Tom Brady.
[00:55:03.220 --> 00:55:04.260]  He's the quarterback.
[00:55:05.260 --> 00:55:10.460]  But he was, as Steve pointed out, he was in the middle of this too many times.
[00:55:10.460 --> 00:55:14.380]  And for all these other incidental players, the people you're all seeing on your screen
[00:55:14.380 --> 00:55:18.140]  right now to be arrested and he not somebody's got some explaining to do.
[00:55:18.140 --> 00:55:22.819]  He's got some he's either a CIA or he's got nude photographs of somebody because he's
[00:55:22.819 --> 00:55:24.700]  he's he's walking away from trouble.
[00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:25.740]  And I don't understand it.
[00:55:25.939 --> 00:55:29.899]  And if our clients did what you're seeing on your screen right now, there'd be a lip
[00:55:29.899 --> 00:55:34.540]  reader, a mind reader and some Kreskin person to interpret what he just said.
[00:55:35.380 --> 00:55:37.460]  It's it's it doesn't make any sense.
[00:55:39.060 --> 00:55:40.500]  Gentlemen, big picture here.
[00:55:41.620 --> 00:55:46.380]  I know our listeners know that January six was provocative action, but the listeners
[00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:50.899]  need to know the viewers, you know, the left, the deep state, they admit this is a
[00:55:50.899 --> 00:55:52.700]  blueprint to criminalize speech.
[00:55:53.020 --> 00:55:56.100]  And if you go out to a demonstration and one person does something wrong out of one
[00:55:56.100 --> 00:55:57.980]  hundred thousand, you go to jail, too.
[00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:03.180]  If I write to you saying I don't like what's going on in downtown Austin, somebody
[00:56:03.180 --> 00:56:07.340]  out of string up city council and I could say that I'm a hothead and we go to a
[00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:11.420]  demonstration that night and somebody breaches a barricade and throws a rock at a
[00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:15.859]  city council member, I'm as guilty of conspiring to cause that event as the Proud
[00:56:15.859 --> 00:56:17.740]  Boys were for appearing that day.
[00:56:17.899 --> 00:56:21.819]  This weaponizes speech in a way that cannot be permitted to stand.
[00:56:22.939 --> 00:56:26.580]  Alice, this weaponizes dissent to a whole nother level.
[00:56:27.180 --> 00:56:32.420]  The Proud Boys trial that we just underwent was the U.S.
[00:56:32.420 --> 00:56:36.020]  government testing its limits and where it could go.
[00:56:36.180 --> 00:56:39.020]  And here's that we we did not.
[00:56:39.020 --> 00:56:43.180]  I mean, every single day, Alex, we came to court ready to fight.
[00:56:43.220 --> 00:56:45.060]  Hold on, Steve. I know you've got a lot more to say.
[00:56:45.060 --> 00:56:46.859]  Do 15 more minutes with us, guys, OK?
[00:56:47.540 --> 00:56:48.700]  Yep, absolutely.
[00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:52.980]  All right. Steve Metcalf, Norm Padas, some of the lead lawyers there on the Proud Boys
[00:56:52.980 --> 00:56:55.260]  show trial. We're going to go to break and come back with them.
[00:56:55.260 --> 00:56:57.939]  But this is a dark day for America and our rights.
[00:56:58.220 --> 00:56:59.779]  These men are completely innocent.
[00:57:00.060 --> 00:57:02.580]  Maximum, they can get a disorderly conduct charge.
[00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:06.460]  They've already served years in jail, solitary confinement.
[00:57:06.700 --> 00:57:08.500]  You know, we're going to go to break. Start our number two.
[00:57:08.500 --> 00:57:09.500]  They'll get it all in the news.
[00:57:09.859 --> 00:57:12.500]  Take your phone calls with 15 more minutes with our guest.
[00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:13.980]  Our number two. Nobody, you know, tune in.
[00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:17.899]  Don't forget our best selling product, the highest quality triionine back in stock.

[00:57:26.859 --> 00:57:28.340]  This is pure. This is amazing.
[00:57:28.540 --> 00:57:30.180]  X3 back in stock.

[00:57:39.420 --> 00:57:42.819]  Our number two with so much more straight ahead.
[00:57:42.819 --> 00:57:43.620]  Stay with us.
[00:57:46.770 --> 00:57:54.210]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution is laying right there in front of you hidden
[00:57:54.210 --> 00:57:55.890]  in plain view.
[00:57:55.890 --> 00:57:58.650]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[00:57:58.650 --> 00:58:02.930]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website where they admit the number
[00:58:02.930 --> 00:58:08.170]  one cause of cognitive disability in the world is iodine deficiency.
[00:58:08.170 --> 00:58:15.450]  The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability is lack of real pure iodine in
[00:58:15.450 --> 00:58:21.730]  the body as they bomb us with the bad halogens, bromine, bromide, chlorine, and so much more.
[00:58:21.730 --> 00:58:27.890]  Upwards of 2 billion people in a Lancet Medical Journal study in 2007 worldwide have cognitive
[00:58:27.890 --> 00:58:31.810]  disabilities because they don't have high quality iodine.
[00:58:31.810 --> 00:58:34.050]  Most iodine is bound to other elements you don't absorb it.
[00:58:34.050 --> 00:58:39.490]  We have X3, all three types of the good iodine together that supercharges your body.
[00:58:39.490 --> 00:58:41.810]  X3 is now back in stock at InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:58:41.810 --> 00:58:45.730]  It's being sold out for over six months for 25% off.

[00:58:49.090 --> 00:59:03.770]  You need to get coordinated with not only your food, but also your health supplements
[00:59:03.770 --> 00:59:06.410]  because it's going to be a matter of life and death.
[00:59:06.410 --> 00:59:08.050]  So support InfoWarsTour.
[00:59:08.050 --> 00:59:13.850]  Listen, you need to put it as a priority because you don't know, I don't know, Alex and I are
[00:59:13.850 --> 00:59:17.130]  telling you how late it is before midnight strikes.
[00:59:17.130 --> 00:59:22.690]  And again, magnesium is critical for your muscles and everything, krill oil.
[00:59:22.690 --> 00:59:28.850]  What I'm watching right before my eyes is a composite overview of nutritional supplements
[00:59:28.850 --> 00:59:30.450]  that will keep you alive.
[00:59:30.450 --> 00:59:34.370]  And I would urge everyone, maybe you don't take vitamins, maybe you don't take nutritional
[00:59:34.370 --> 00:59:36.930]  supplements, but the day will come.
[00:59:36.930 --> 00:59:39.210]  Vitamin C and zinc, absolutely imperative for the cold.
[00:59:39.210 --> 00:59:41.610]  DNA force, absolutely imperative.
[00:59:41.610 --> 00:59:43.210]  Mineral fusion, absolutely.
[00:59:43.210 --> 00:59:46.610]  As you're drinking filtered water, a lot of it will become demineralized.
[00:59:46.610 --> 00:59:51.009]  You have to have these products.
[00:59:51.009 --> 00:59:57.090]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:06.930 --> 01:00:12.610]  All right.
[01:00:12.610 --> 01:00:14.490]  Some stations don't carry this first five minutes.
[01:00:14.490 --> 01:00:16.529]  We got another 10 minute segment after our guest.
[01:00:16.529 --> 01:00:22.730]  I want to try to just go to Norm Pattis and go to Steve Metcalf, who I guess are the patron
[01:00:22.730 --> 01:00:26.290]  saints of lost causes going up against this evil and just continue.
[01:00:26.290 --> 01:00:28.130]  Steve, we got cut off by a break.
[01:00:28.130 --> 01:00:30.970]  What this means to America, people that aren't constitutional lawyers, people who don't know
[01:00:30.970 --> 01:00:31.970]  history.
[01:00:31.970 --> 01:00:35.650]  I mean, the left even admits this is a plan to arrest their opposition.
[01:00:35.650 --> 01:00:40.170]  We have Pelosi out there months with troops at the Capitol, barbed wire around it, parading
[01:00:40.170 --> 01:00:42.490]  them around.
[01:00:42.490 --> 01:00:46.590]  We have Biden saying the number one terror threat is Trump supporters when no statistics
[01:00:46.590 --> 01:00:47.850]  show that.
[01:00:47.850 --> 01:00:52.050]  The good news is polls show the American people don't think January 6th is important, 94 percent
[01:00:52.050 --> 01:00:54.250]  think it's garbage.
[01:00:54.250 --> 01:00:58.210]  Their attempt at shelling this martial law has failed, but they don't care.
[01:00:58.210 --> 01:01:04.529]  They're still in special jurisdictions able to manipulate juries into literally turning
[01:01:04.529 --> 01:01:07.330]  those little jurisdictions into the Soviet Union.
[01:01:07.330 --> 01:01:11.130]  I was talking to Norm last night, I guess when you were at dinner with him, he made
[01:01:11.130 --> 01:01:16.290]  the point that D.C. was set up so that outside groups couldn't influence the Capitol and
[01:01:16.290 --> 01:01:17.529]  take it over.
[01:01:17.529 --> 01:01:22.570]  But instead now they've set it up as its own little private Potemkin village that is now
[01:01:22.570 --> 01:01:23.970]  taking over the rest of the country.
[01:01:23.970 --> 01:01:27.210]  So can you speak to that?
[01:01:27.210 --> 01:01:28.210]  Where to begin?
[01:01:28.210 --> 01:01:33.010]  I mean, the U.S. Capitol police have now expanded in various different ways across the country
[01:01:33.010 --> 01:01:36.850]  than ever before and since 9-11.
[01:01:36.850 --> 01:01:43.090]  But to go back, Alex, and talk about the significance of this particular case and what this means
[01:01:43.090 --> 01:01:44.450]  for the future.
[01:01:44.450 --> 01:01:50.890]  This was a scenario where the government was testing its limits and how so.
[01:01:50.890 --> 01:01:59.210]  Enrique Tarrio, the mastermind leader, was not in Washington, D.C. on that day.
[01:01:59.210 --> 01:02:00.890]  That was a big leap for them.
[01:02:00.890 --> 01:02:05.930]  That was a huge scenario that they had to really fill in that void and see how they
[01:02:05.930 --> 01:02:08.210]  could actually prove it.
[01:02:08.210 --> 01:02:15.090]  And this, I believe, was a test run scenario as to where they're going to go from here.
[01:02:15.090 --> 01:02:16.690]  They had to add force.
[01:02:16.690 --> 01:02:23.370]  They had to add someone who looked angry, someone who, quote unquote, broke a window.
[01:02:23.370 --> 01:02:25.570]  That's where Dominic Pizzola came in.
[01:02:25.570 --> 01:02:31.490]  Dominic Pizzola, I essentially argued before the jury was a pawn in this situation.
[01:02:31.490 --> 01:02:36.970]  He was someone who was put there that day to muddy up the rest of these guys and to make
[01:02:36.970 --> 01:02:43.690]  it look or to tie a link to Enrique Tarrio, who was not even in D.C. on that day.
[01:02:43.690 --> 01:02:49.650]  So now the government is armed with this scenario where the only person who was found not guilty
[01:02:49.650 --> 01:02:55.130]  of seditious conspiracy out of those five gentlemen was my client, Dominic Pizzola.
[01:02:55.130 --> 01:03:02.290]  So now they have essentially been successful in being able to prove that Enrique Tarrio,
[01:03:02.290 --> 01:03:09.930]  who was not there in D.C., who was in a hotel room in Baltimore, Maryland on that day, is
[01:03:09.930 --> 01:03:13.890]  capable of actually committing this crime.
[01:03:13.890 --> 01:03:21.930]  Now, this is a civil error crime that I believe the essence of, and I don't know if Norm disagrees
[01:03:21.930 --> 01:03:27.490]  with me here, is to take over your government and to actually try to become your government.
[01:03:27.490 --> 01:03:33.610]  It was a joke during the trial that Norm did that I thought was absolutely amazing, where
[01:03:33.610 --> 01:03:37.770]  he basically asked the witness, well, which one of these knuckleheads over here is going
[01:03:37.770 --> 01:03:40.810]  to be the secretary of transportation?
[01:03:40.810 --> 01:03:42.570]  Who's going to be the vice president?
[01:03:42.570 --> 01:03:44.810]  I mean, it's out.
[01:03:44.810 --> 01:03:50.250]  It still blows my mind, Alex, that they were charging seditious conspiracy in these cases.
[01:03:50.250 --> 01:03:53.690]  Now they've got it on three Oath Keepers and now the Proud Boys.
[01:03:53.690 --> 01:03:59.570]  The precedent is set for them to go after anybody now, even if you weren't there in
[01:03:59.570 --> 01:04:01.970]  Washington, D.C. on January 6th.
[01:04:01.970 --> 01:04:06.430]  Hold on, hold on, Norm, we're going to break and come back and explain this, but the guy
[01:04:06.430 --> 01:04:10.730]  they say is a mastermind working for Trump wasn't even there.
[01:04:10.730 --> 01:04:15.090]  Then the man they claim was ordered, the only one that did some violence with a shield breaking
[01:04:15.090 --> 01:04:18.570]  a window, nothing compared to Andy for the left, Kamala Harris bells those people out
[01:04:18.570 --> 01:04:21.330]  all the time that shoot, shoot at people and burn buildings down.
[01:04:21.330 --> 01:04:22.330]  We're not defending that.
[01:04:22.330 --> 01:04:25.170]  Mostly peaceful protest show the low level guy.
[01:04:25.170 --> 01:04:28.770]  They claim their commanding is found not guilty of being a conspiracy.
[01:04:28.770 --> 01:04:33.050]  So how is there a conspiracy of the low level guys, not a conspiracy with the higher level
[01:04:33.050 --> 01:04:34.050]  people?
[01:04:34.050 --> 01:04:35.050]  Am I saying that right?
[01:04:35.050 --> 01:04:36.050]  Yes.
[01:04:36.050 --> 01:04:37.050]  Yes.
[01:04:37.050 --> 01:04:38.050]  Essentially.
[01:04:38.050 --> 01:04:40.529]  And then another point is when was this conspiracy formed?
[01:04:40.529 --> 01:04:47.450]  So Alex, they actually they actually argue, but didn't argue that on the ground that
[01:04:47.450 --> 01:04:52.570]  day on January 6th, there was a march from the Washington.
[01:04:52.570 --> 01:04:53.570]  Hold on.
[01:04:53.570 --> 01:04:55.010]  We'll be back in 60 seconds.
[01:04:55.010 --> 01:04:56.010]  Stay there.
[01:04:56.010 --> 01:04:57.010]  Steve Metcalf.
[01:04:57.010 --> 01:05:04.529]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution is laying right there in front of you, hidden
[01:05:04.529 --> 01:05:06.170]  in plain view.
[01:05:06.170 --> 01:05:08.930]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[01:05:08.930 --> 01:05:11.170]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the U.N.
[01:05:11.170 --> 01:05:16.550]  Zone website where they admit the number one cause of cognitive disability in the world
[01:05:16.650 --> 01:05:18.470]  is iodine deficiency.
[01:05:18.470 --> 01:05:25.750]  The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability is lack of real, pure iodine in
[01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:32.029]  the body as they bomb us with the bad halogens, bromine, bromide, chlorine and so much more.
[01:05:32.029 --> 01:05:37.710]  Upwards of two billion people in a Lancet Medical Journal study in 2007 worldwide have
[01:05:37.710 --> 01:05:42.110]  cognitive disabilities because they don't have high quality iodine.
[01:05:42.110 --> 01:05:43.470]  Most iodine is bound to other elements.
[01:05:43.470 --> 01:05:44.470]  You don't absorb it.
[01:05:44.470 --> 01:05:49.870]  We have X3, all three types of good iodine together that supercharges your body.
[01:05:49.870 --> 01:05:52.150]  X3 is now back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:56.070]  It's been sold out for over six months for 25% off.
[01:05:56.070 --> 01:05:57.430]  X3 back in stock.
[01:05:57.430 --> 01:05:58.430]  Take action now.
[01:05:58.430 --> 01:05:59.430]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:05:59.430 --> 01:06:27.029]  So this is the bizarre scene two years and four months ago, Pelosi parading in front
[01:06:27.029 --> 01:06:34.110]  of the National Guard troops, mumbling under her mask, you can't hear a damn thing she's
[01:06:34.110 --> 01:06:35.110]  saying.
[01:06:35.110 --> 01:06:38.470]  Meanwhile, they would not feed the troops, they treated them like crap, made them sleep
[01:06:38.470 --> 01:06:40.150]  on the floor.
[01:06:40.150 --> 01:06:42.990]  This is just a group of clowns.
[01:06:42.990 --> 01:06:47.830]  So the bad news is they're trying to set up a classical tyranny with high tech overlays.
[01:06:47.830 --> 01:06:56.350]  The good news is they're completely incompetent and the American people see right through it.
[01:06:56.350 --> 01:07:01.510]  So we're talking to Norm Pattis, we're talking to Steve Metcalf, both leading lawyers on
[01:07:01.510 --> 01:07:05.310]  the Proud Boy show trial, talking about patron saints of lost causes.
[01:07:05.310 --> 01:07:08.830]  Steve, we're trying to finish a point about what this weaponization means.
[01:07:08.830 --> 01:07:12.150]  The Justice Department admits they want to use this against conservatives and libertarians
[01:07:12.150 --> 01:07:15.430]  and populists and Christians and nationalists now.
[01:07:15.430 --> 01:07:17.470]  The left is mostly peaceful.
[01:07:17.470 --> 01:07:18.990]  They get to march and burn things down.
[01:07:18.990 --> 01:07:21.110]  Everybody else is locked down in their houses.
[01:07:21.110 --> 01:07:24.590]  But simultaneously, Kyle Rittenhouse is bad.
[01:07:24.590 --> 01:07:29.550]  When people are chasing him, shooting at him, saying, we're going to kill you, the left
[01:07:29.550 --> 01:07:30.990]  says he's the bad guy.
[01:07:30.990 --> 01:07:33.190]  So it's just more of the same.
[01:07:33.190 --> 01:07:36.590]  Please finish your point than any other points you and Norm Pattis would like to make about
[01:07:36.590 --> 01:07:38.710]  this historic show trial.
[01:07:38.710 --> 01:07:41.390]  Absolutely, Alex.
[01:07:41.390 --> 01:07:43.029]  So what does this mean?
[01:07:43.029 --> 01:07:48.630]  It means, and Norm and I saw this coming from a mile away, it means that the government
[01:07:48.630 --> 01:07:55.510]  could actually now prove a conspiracy based on it happening almost instantaneously or
[01:07:55.510 --> 01:07:58.110]  on the ground that day.
[01:07:58.110 --> 01:08:03.590]  With the Proud Boys, 10 a.m., they met up at the Washington Monument, they marched together,
[01:08:03.590 --> 01:08:08.710]  they stopped at a reflecting pool, they took a picture, they said a couple of prayers,
[01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:13.910]  they then walked around a little bit more, and they stopped at an area with a whole bunch
[01:08:13.910 --> 01:08:16.150]  of food trucks.
[01:08:16.150 --> 01:08:21.309]  Now without, now being a little bit, because there is no evidence to show that there is
[01:08:21.309 --> 01:08:27.150]  anything at all that happened during that time, there's influences and innuendos thrown
[01:08:27.150 --> 01:08:34.510]  out that all of a sudden this plan was hatched at that time or around that timeframe.
[01:08:34.510 --> 01:08:40.390]  And that led up to the video that you showed before, which is Ryan Samsel at the fence
[01:08:40.390 --> 01:08:43.590]  and Ray Epps goes and whispers in his ear.
[01:08:43.590 --> 01:08:48.309]  And then we have the footage of Ray Epps helping with the fences ram it down.
[01:08:48.309 --> 01:08:51.630]  So let me give a parallel.
[01:08:51.630 --> 01:08:53.990]  Let me do this, though, Alex, I see time is short.
[01:08:53.990 --> 01:08:54.990]  Here's what's going to happen.
[01:08:54.990 --> 01:08:59.350]  I mean, the foundation has been laid to indict Donald Trump.
[01:08:59.350 --> 01:09:03.430]  And let's talk about something, Stephen, I haven't mentioned yet, a new theory of liability
[01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:07.510]  in a criminal court that was introduced for the first time in this case, so-called tools
[01:09:07.510 --> 01:09:08.510]  theory.
[01:09:08.510 --> 01:09:12.550]  If the three of us, Alex, you, Stephen, I agree to commit some unlawful act and we start
[01:09:12.550 --> 01:09:16.830]  running our mouth about it after the agreement and before the act, each one of our statements
[01:09:16.830 --> 01:09:21.030]  is admissible and is evidence against one another as a statement of a co-conspirator
[01:09:21.030 --> 01:09:23.710]  if that statement is in furtherance of the conspiracy.
[01:09:23.710 --> 01:09:30.550]  In this case, people the Proud Boys never knew, never met or held to be their tools
[01:09:30.550 --> 01:09:34.550]  and their statements and conduct was admitted into evidence.
[01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:38.110]  All these people you see in this crowd, all these people you see on the screen, these
[01:09:38.110 --> 01:09:41.670]  were deemed to be tools of the Proud Boys influenced by them.
[01:09:41.670 --> 01:09:43.510]  Where's the significance of this?
[01:09:43.510 --> 01:09:48.630]  For Donald Trump standing on the ellipse that morning, talking to the crowd, I believe
[01:09:48.630 --> 01:09:53.150]  the government will now claim that Donald Trump was in a conspiracy with several people
[01:09:53.150 --> 01:09:59.230]  in his office to engage in seditious conspiracy to oppose the operation of the government.
[01:09:59.230 --> 01:10:01.510]  That's what they're talking about with this prosecutor, Smith.
[01:10:01.510 --> 01:10:05.070]  They're actually saying they're getting ready to indict Trump now with these convictions
[01:10:05.070 --> 01:10:07.750]  claiming he was commanding them.
[01:10:07.750 --> 01:10:08.870]  I suspect that'll happen.
[01:10:09.870 --> 01:10:14.470]  To the degree the Proud Boys use tools, they're openly saying the Proud Boys were the president's
[01:10:14.470 --> 01:10:15.470]  tools.
[01:10:15.470 --> 01:10:16.470]  There's no evidence of it.
[01:10:16.470 --> 01:10:20.230]  The smartest thing that Donald Trump could do right now would be to call Steve Metcalf
[01:10:20.230 --> 01:10:22.830]  because all of my pride is wounded.
[01:10:22.830 --> 01:10:25.870]  I didn't get an acquittal for my client on seditious conspiracy.
[01:10:25.870 --> 01:10:27.950]  He got one for Dominic Pozzola.
[01:10:27.950 --> 01:10:31.450]  And here's what the Trump legal team needs to be doing right now.
[01:10:31.450 --> 01:10:35.270]  They need to be finding people who understand the chaos of that day.
[01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:36.270]  Steve would be one of them.
[01:10:36.270 --> 01:10:37.270]  I would be another.
[01:10:37.270 --> 01:10:38.950]  They need to get these lawyers in a room.
[01:10:38.950 --> 01:10:43.150]  They need to debrief grand jury witnesses and they need to start figuring out how they're
[01:10:43.150 --> 01:10:44.950]  going to defend Donald Trump.
[01:10:44.950 --> 01:10:48.630]  Because as God is my witness, I predict by the end of June, there's going to be indictment
[01:10:48.630 --> 01:10:51.710]  of Trump and some part of it's going to be related to January 6th.
[01:10:51.710 --> 01:10:56.110]  They're going to claim he engaged in conspiracy that Stop the Steal was fraud and that he
[01:10:56.110 --> 01:11:02.270]  used the protesters as tools in part of his conspiracy and the special prosecutor has telegraphed
[01:11:02.270 --> 01:11:03.270]  that.
[01:11:03.270 --> 01:11:07.470]  I don't want to confuse this reviewers that are as old as I am or older like you, Norm.
[01:11:07.470 --> 01:11:08.470]  I remember.
[01:11:08.470 --> 01:11:09.470]  Hey, wait a minute.
[01:11:09.470 --> 01:11:10.470]  Where's my cane?
[01:11:10.470 --> 01:11:13.550]  And I remember in the late 80s, whenever it was, the John Gotti trial.
[01:11:13.550 --> 01:11:18.750]  And back then, the FBI had to plant microphones out the street, hide them inside the building.
[01:11:18.750 --> 01:11:20.030]  Gotti knew they were being spied on.
[01:11:20.030 --> 01:11:23.309]  So they'd walk around the street and plan murders and plan stuff.
[01:11:23.309 --> 01:11:25.550]  And that was proof that they had the conspiracy.
[01:11:25.550 --> 01:11:27.070]  They had him planning stuff.
[01:11:27.070 --> 01:11:30.230]  And then they caught the people going out and doing the murders.
[01:11:30.230 --> 01:11:35.110]  And then they had witnesses, I guess, you know, Sammy the Bull or whatever his name
[01:11:35.110 --> 01:11:37.110]  was, who was Samuel Garano.
[01:11:37.110 --> 01:11:38.110]  Yes.
[01:11:38.110 --> 01:11:39.110]  So they had a witness.
[01:11:39.110 --> 01:11:40.110]  They had a witness that was there.
[01:11:40.110 --> 01:11:43.230]  They had audio and video and they barely convicted him.
[01:11:43.230 --> 01:11:44.990]  They have them saying nothing.
[01:11:44.990 --> 01:11:48.190]  They have no proof and they've just been convicted.
[01:11:48.190 --> 01:11:52.430]  This case of limits, usually there's a staying in the law post hoc ergo proctor hoc.
[01:11:52.430 --> 01:11:56.309]  Just because something happened before an event doesn't mean it proved the evidence evident
[01:11:56.309 --> 01:11:59.930]  that the event afterward, you have to prove a mechanism.
[01:11:59.930 --> 01:12:02.470]  You have to tie things together with evidence.
[01:12:02.470 --> 01:12:08.370]  This case eliminated the requirement for evidence and transformed the law, the law of conspiracy
[01:12:08.370 --> 01:12:10.450]  into what Steve called fairy dust.
[01:12:10.450 --> 01:12:16.930]  They can just say, hey, you said this yesterday, you did this today, kaboom, that's a conspiracy.
[01:12:16.930 --> 01:12:21.010]  And if they did it to the Proud Boys with the nominal evidence they had in this case,
[01:12:21.010 --> 01:12:24.210]  how much more powerful will their case be against Donald Trump?
[01:12:24.210 --> 01:12:29.250]  And what will that do to the republic when a man who 70 million people voted for and
[01:12:29.250 --> 01:12:33.250]  who hunt tens of thousands turned up at the Capitol to to protest.
[01:12:33.250 --> 01:12:35.970]  They chose to believe their commander in chief.
[01:12:35.970 --> 01:12:41.090]  The government says, hey, I think you have more like a million votes and about a million
[01:12:41.090 --> 01:12:42.490]  people showed up in D.C. that day.
[01:12:42.490 --> 01:12:45.850]  OK, well, I don't know what the numbers were, but I mean, the point is, who are the Proud
[01:12:45.850 --> 01:12:49.490]  Boys and who are the crowds supposed to believe the commander in chief or the thief?
[01:12:49.490 --> 01:12:52.890]  And when it becomes a crime to believe your president, they've declared war on the American
[01:12:52.890 --> 01:12:56.290]  people and they're trying to ban the American flag now.
[01:12:56.290 --> 01:12:57.290]  Sorry, Steve.
[01:12:57.290 --> 01:12:58.290]  Go ahead.
[01:12:58.330 --> 01:13:05.090]  Alex, you you hit the nail on the head in talking about John Gotti's case and when investigations
[01:13:05.090 --> 01:13:06.650]  used to be investigations.
[01:13:06.650 --> 01:13:08.330]  I want you to think about this.
[01:13:08.330 --> 01:13:11.130]  I want the listeners to think about this one more time.
[01:13:11.130 --> 01:13:12.930]  The tools theory.
[01:13:12.930 --> 01:13:17.690]  This is the first time I've ever seen or heard anything like this being introduced in a conspiracy
[01:13:17.690 --> 01:13:18.690]  case.
[01:13:18.690 --> 01:13:25.050]  That is essentially the one person can use another person as a tool.
[01:13:25.050 --> 01:13:28.970]  And that tool doesn't even know what they're being used for.
[01:13:28.970 --> 01:13:35.250]  If I wanted to basically benefit or be in furtherance of the conspiracy that I plant.
[01:13:35.250 --> 01:13:39.030]  So here we have no conspiracy whatsoever.
[01:13:39.030 --> 01:13:45.890]  But if another guy who's affiliated with the Proud Boys spray something towards an officer
[01:13:45.890 --> 01:13:51.050]  that we never knew, never spoke about, never crossed paths with any of these five defendants,
[01:13:51.050 --> 01:13:56.330]  all of a sudden that's going to be showcased and blasted before a jury as if it was ordered
[01:13:56.330 --> 01:13:58.930]  by one of these defendants in this case.
[01:13:58.930 --> 01:14:01.370]  That's how bizarre this trial got.
[01:14:01.370 --> 01:14:06.730]  This guilt by association had nothing to do with these guys whatsoever.
[01:14:06.730 --> 01:14:08.730]  And that's where they needed the force.
[01:14:08.730 --> 01:14:11.170]  And that's what the left that's what the left does, though.
[01:14:11.170 --> 01:14:14.170]  They say anybody that wants to control the borders, a white supremacist, anybody that
[01:14:14.170 --> 01:14:18.290]  doesn't want election frauds, a white supremacist, anybody that doesn't want to take a shot as
[01:14:18.290 --> 01:14:19.290]  a white supremacist.
[01:14:19.290 --> 01:14:20.830]  It has nothing to do with being a white supremacist.
[01:14:21.610 --> 01:14:22.610]  They just label us all as that.
[01:14:22.610 --> 01:14:29.110]  And then Biden in June of two thousand and one declared all his political opposition
[01:14:29.110 --> 01:14:35.430]  terrorist if they believed in over 20 things, including later the Afghan withdrawal.
[01:14:35.430 --> 01:14:37.350]  I mean, it's just anything I don't like.
[01:14:37.350 --> 01:14:38.590]  You are a terrorist.
[01:14:38.590 --> 01:14:40.550]  They say white supremacist terrorist.
[01:14:40.550 --> 01:14:42.190]  You're a white supremacist.
[01:14:42.190 --> 01:14:43.190]  And it's garbage.
[01:14:43.190 --> 01:14:46.670]  People need to say, you know, when you hear somebody call you a white supremacist, your
[01:14:46.670 --> 01:14:49.510]  first remark should be, what is it you want from me right now?
[01:14:49.510 --> 01:14:51.370]  How are you trying to shake me down?
[01:14:51.370 --> 01:14:52.590]  This land is your land.
[01:14:52.590 --> 01:14:53.950]  This land is my land.
[01:14:53.950 --> 01:14:54.950]  There's no color.
[01:14:54.950 --> 01:14:56.309]  That's a barrier to entry.
[01:14:56.309 --> 01:14:58.470]  And I have had it up to here and beyond.
[01:14:58.470 --> 01:15:00.070]  Guys, this is too important.
[01:15:00.070 --> 01:15:01.070]  Don't hang up.
[01:15:01.070 --> 01:15:02.070]  Do 10 more minutes.
[01:15:02.070 --> 01:15:03.470]  I promise you'll be gone at like twenty eight after.
[01:15:03.470 --> 01:15:06.350]  And then, folks, I got tons of news on your calls coming up.
[01:15:06.350 --> 01:15:07.350]  I want to live.
[01:15:07.350 --> 01:15:08.350]  No, no.
[01:15:08.350 --> 01:15:09.350]  Stay right there.
[01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:10.350]  Don't leave.
[01:15:10.350 --> 01:15:11.350]  We're going to go to break.
[01:15:11.350 --> 01:15:13.990]  We'll do 10 more minutes with both these guys on the other side, let them finish their
[01:15:13.990 --> 01:15:14.990]  points.
[01:15:14.990 --> 01:15:16.430]  But, folks, this is bone chilling.
[01:15:16.430 --> 01:15:18.110]  And remember, I got skin in the game.
[01:15:18.110 --> 01:15:23.110]  They are admittedly trying to put me in prison, claiming I ran the quote attack on the Capitol.
[01:15:23.110 --> 01:15:25.670]  Believe me, if I ran an attack on the Capitol, it'd be a lot different.
[01:15:25.670 --> 01:15:27.389]  Plus, the Capitol doesn't run anything.
[01:15:27.389 --> 01:15:28.809]  It's just where they vote.
[01:15:28.809 --> 01:15:36.270]  It's all out at Cheyenne Mountain and Site R, and Site M, and in Colorado Springs.
[01:15:36.270 --> 01:15:40.550]  I mean, take over the U.S. government, you need about 10,000 nuclear weapons.
[01:15:40.550 --> 01:15:43.870]  I don't want to take over the government with violence, I want to take it back with ideas.
[01:15:43.870 --> 01:15:50.350]  The idea that I wanted this fiasco, that let the tyrants take over, is preposterous.
[01:15:50.350 --> 01:15:54.350]  The globalists have the motive, and their fingerprints are all over it, and the media's
[01:15:54.350 --> 01:15:56.030]  defending Ray Abbs.
[01:15:56.030 --> 01:15:59.470]  Stay with us.
[01:15:59.470 --> 01:16:02.030]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[01:16:02.030 --> 01:16:04.110]  Please write this down, and please go look this up.
[01:16:04.110 --> 01:16:06.150]  It will change your life.
[01:16:06.150 --> 01:16:10.630]  The U.N. admits, and the Lancet Medical Journal admits, that upwards of two billion people
[01:16:10.630 --> 01:16:14.870]  have mental disabilities, and declining cognitive abilities.
[01:16:14.870 --> 01:16:20.389]  The term they use is intellectual disability, because of lack of iodine.
[01:16:20.389 --> 01:16:25.230]  Most iodine in the environment is bound to other elements, so your body can't absorb
[01:16:25.230 --> 01:16:26.230]  it.
[01:16:26.230 --> 01:16:30.430]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[01:16:30.430 --> 01:16:36.510]  And Infowarestore.com has the only iodine out there that actually has this type of full
[01:16:36.510 --> 01:16:37.510]  effect.
[01:16:37.510 --> 01:16:40.550]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3's been sold out for six months.
[01:16:40.550 --> 01:16:43.470]  It's very hard to produce, and it's finally back in stock.
[01:16:43.470 --> 01:16:46.510]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[01:16:46.510 --> 01:16:48.710]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is powerful.
[01:16:48.710 --> 01:16:50.030]  You and your family need it.
[01:16:50.030 --> 01:16:52.230]  It's 25% off, back in stock.
[01:16:52.230 --> 01:16:53.230]  X3.
[01:16:53.230 --> 01:16:56.550]  Try iodine exclusively at Infowarestore.com.
[01:16:56.550 --> 01:16:59.870]  Take action now, but regardless, research is info.
[01:16:59.870 --> 01:17:05.270]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire food
[01:17:05.270 --> 01:17:06.630]  supply.
[01:17:06.630 --> 01:17:11.270]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element, which
[01:17:11.270 --> 01:17:15.470]  has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[01:17:15.470 --> 01:17:18.309]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[01:17:18.309 --> 01:17:21.630]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[01:17:21.630 --> 01:17:26.830]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally
[01:17:26.830 --> 01:17:32.790]  keep the soil rich with iodine, and we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount
[01:17:32.790 --> 01:17:34.870]  of iodine every day.
[01:17:34.870 --> 01:17:41.510]  Derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the Earth's surface, our Infowars
[01:17:41.510 --> 01:17:46.389]  Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[01:17:46.389 --> 01:17:52.550]  Pure nascent iodine, stabilized in an activated triiodine form.

[01:17:59.430 --> 01:18:03.710]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move against Tucker
[01:18:03.710 --> 01:18:05.389]  Carlson and take him off the air.
[01:18:05.389 --> 01:18:08.030]  People said, no way, he's the most powerful thing that ever happened.
[01:18:08.030 --> 01:18:09.750]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[01:18:09.750 --> 01:18:12.750]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him.
[01:18:12.750 --> 01:18:15.950]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[01:18:15.950 --> 01:18:17.750]  It's the same thing with Infowars.
[01:18:17.750 --> 01:18:23.470]  But Infowars is not owned by Fox, or controlled by George Soros, or owned by Spotify like
[01:18:23.470 --> 01:18:24.470]  Joe Rogan.
[01:18:24.470 --> 01:18:28.110]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[01:18:28.110 --> 01:18:30.030]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[01:18:30.030 --> 01:18:34.670]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[01:18:34.670 --> 01:18:38.550]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[01:18:38.550 --> 01:18:41.710]  So I want to thank you for your support and encourage viewers and listeners to understand,
[01:18:41.710 --> 01:18:44.309]  please don't take Infowars for granted.
[01:18:44.309 --> 01:18:45.590]  We're barely hanging on.
[01:18:45.590 --> 01:18:49.030]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, and your financial support while getting great
[01:18:49.030 --> 01:18:51.389]  products at the same time at Infowarestore.com.

[01:18:57.270 --> 01:18:58.350]  to these tyrants.
[01:19:27.870 --> 01:19:28.870]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[01:19:28.870 --> 01:19:33.030]  It says Infowars.com on the back of the shirt.
[01:19:33.030 --> 01:19:34.270]  We also have Alex Jones for President.
[01:19:34.270 --> 01:19:35.670]  No, I'm not running for president.
[01:19:35.670 --> 01:19:38.870]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt, red, white, and blue.
[01:19:38.870 --> 01:19:40.830]  Alex Jones for President 2024.
[01:19:40.830 --> 01:19:43.470]  It's a fun conversational piece and a limited edition shirt.
[01:19:43.470 --> 01:19:45.309]  Great way to fund the operation.
[01:19:45.309 --> 01:19:53.910]  So get your Alex Jones for President and Trump mugshot shirts at Infowarestore.com or by calling
[01:19:53.910 --> 01:19:59.990]  toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:19:59.990 --> 01:20:06.110]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:07.580 --> 01:20:35.500]  Final segment with two lawyers, the Patriot Saints of Los Causas, the Son of Los Causas,
[01:20:35.500 --> 01:20:41.580]  and the District of St. Mordor in D.C. for another show trial.
[01:20:41.580 --> 01:20:48.420]  I remember talking last night and just repeat what you said, you said it very eloquently
[01:20:48.420 --> 01:20:52.160]  explaining and of course I know the history, it's accurate, but I mean you said it better
[01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:53.420]  than I would.
[01:20:53.420 --> 01:20:58.940]  Explain the legalese why they have the District of Columbia and how that was set up so that
[01:20:58.940 --> 01:21:02.980]  the states couldn't override it and how that's been used to reverse it and how it's literally
[01:21:02.980 --> 01:21:04.820]  setting up its own little kingdom.
[01:21:04.820 --> 01:21:10.180]  Yeah, so the District of Columbia is one of the few original federal territories established
[01:21:10.180 --> 01:21:11.540]  by the Constitution.
[01:21:11.540 --> 01:21:16.380]  It was initially I believe a five square mile area and it was designed to not fall under
[01:21:16.380 --> 01:21:20.540]  the influence of a particular state, to be independent so that no state would have too
[01:21:20.540 --> 01:21:23.360]  much influence on the federal government.
[01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:27.660]  At that time the balance of federalism was tipped vastly in the direction of the states
[01:21:27.660 --> 01:21:28.880]  and they had more power.
[01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:32.200]  The federal government was supposed to be one of the enumerated and limited powers.
[01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:36.000]  Over time, as we all know, the federal government has become an instrument of a deep state,
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:40.920]  quite frankly, a sense of universalism and has acquired incredible powers over us and
[01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:42.559]  is seeking even more.
[01:21:42.559 --> 01:21:47.040]  And the result in this district is that it's a company town.
[01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:51.240]  Almost everybody here either works for government, is a lobbyist, serves the government, serves
[01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:52.320]  government interests.
[01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:56.880]  You see on license plates here, D.C., you know, taxation without representation, we're
[01:21:56.880 --> 01:21:57.880]  not a state.
[01:21:57.880 --> 01:21:59.040]  You don't need to be a state.
[01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:03.680]  You control the whole freaking country and money's flowing in here like blood into a
[01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:04.680]  satanic vessel.
[01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:09.320]  It's the richest city in the U.S. by far.
[01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:13.600]  And so, you know, we knew we were going to have problems on our hands when we couldn't
[01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:16.000]  get the case moved out of D.C.
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:20.640]  This is a company town and business of Washington, D.C. is the business of government.
[01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:26.080]  And so, you know, one of the things that was so moving to me in this experience is I took
[01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:30.400]  my first tour of the Capitol and they show you a film, E Pluribus Unum, they say, out
[01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:31.400]  of one many.
[01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:33.480]  This is where the people come to become one.
[01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:38.640]  Well, this is only supposed to be a forum that you visit to establish laws to take home.
[01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:45.600]  When people made it a home of their own, they've decided that that home is the metropole of
[01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:49.920]  a giant plantation and that we the people in our various states and locations exist
[01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:51.080]  to serve it.
[01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:53.080]  That's never been the American way.
[01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:57.559]  And I repeat Jefferson's word, when the people fear government, there is tyranny.
[01:22:57.559 --> 01:22:59.960]  When the government fears people, there is liberty.
[01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:04.200]  And I'm proud to have represented the Proud Boys and to those Proud Boy affiliates and
[01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:05.200]  members out there.
[01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:09.280]  You'll know what I say when I say the following, Uhuru, that's their greeting.
[01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:11.360]  And it's Swahili for freedom.
[01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:14.480]  And that has been the gamble of American history throughout our lives.
[01:23:14.480 --> 01:23:20.280]  I love how they're white supremacist whose whose motto is a Swahili word for freedom.
[01:23:20.840 --> 01:23:24.760]  Oh, and of course, Enrique Tarrio, it couldn't be said enough at trial.
[01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:25.760]  He's an Afro-Cuban.
[01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:30.559]  And many of the witnesses we called on behalf of the Proud Boys were persons of color.
[01:23:30.559 --> 01:23:31.720]  We had Hispanic witnesses.
[01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:33.160]  We had Jewish witnesses.
[01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:35.120]  But no, they're white supremacists.
[01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:39.200]  And it's because that's an easy way to demonize dissent.
[01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:42.760]  Call somebody a bad name and they're afraid to step up, step forward.
[01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:47.260]  I don't know what your perspective is on that, Steve, but I found we were able to eliminate
[01:23:47.260 --> 01:23:50.040]  that rhetoric, I think.
[01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:57.240]  We stepped into this equation at trial at such an unfair advantage.
[01:23:57.240 --> 01:24:04.000]  The terminology or just the word insurrection or insurrectionist being used and splashed
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:08.320]  across the country for two years really set the stage.
[01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:15.019]  And then the terminology of white supremacy being linked to the Proud Boys is something
[01:24:15.019 --> 01:24:21.500]  that actually stuck with people and it resonated with people and made people in D.C. actually
[01:24:21.500 --> 01:24:24.660]  fear the Proud Boys or fear some of these men.
[01:24:24.660 --> 01:24:29.900]  So when the media, we lost the media right off the bat for the last two years.
[01:24:29.900 --> 01:24:32.620]  The left did an amazing job at demonizing these men.
[01:24:32.620 --> 01:24:33.620]  Oh, I believe me.
[01:24:33.620 --> 01:24:34.620]  Isn't it Sandy Hook?
[01:24:34.620 --> 01:24:39.019]  They try you in the press, then the judge finds you guilty, then you can't defend yourself.
[01:24:39.019 --> 01:24:41.980]  And they testified that I sent people to pee on graves.
[01:24:41.980 --> 01:24:42.980]  No evidence.
[01:24:43.180 --> 01:24:46.019]  Talk about defamation, just completely made up.
[01:24:46.019 --> 01:24:49.340]  They gave an FBI agent who I never said his name, never showed a photo of him, didn't know
[01:24:49.340 --> 01:24:53.100]  who he was until he sued me, 90 plus million dollars.
[01:24:55.300 --> 01:24:58.260]  And then the January 6th committee.
[01:25:00.140 --> 01:25:01.980]  I don't believe in coincidences.
[01:25:01.980 --> 01:25:04.860]  And Norman, I kept having these conversations back and forth.
[01:25:05.540 --> 01:25:11.660]  Alex, the day that we started picking the jury was December 19th.
[01:25:11.660 --> 01:25:17.540]  They set this whole thing up at the January 6th committee that weekend, going into that
[01:25:17.540 --> 01:25:22.500]  week of December 19th, that they were coming out with the decision that was a report against
[01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:26.260]  Trump. Every day we had to go in and make a new motion for a mistrial.
[01:25:26.260 --> 01:25:27.380]  Basically, that's right.
[01:25:27.540 --> 01:25:31.220]  We ended their their show committee right as the show trial started.
[01:25:31.620 --> 01:25:36.260]  Well, and then get this, Alex, the very day that the jury goes to deliberations that
[01:25:36.260 --> 01:25:39.580]  morning, Joe Biden announced his presidential campaign.
[01:25:39.700 --> 01:25:43.059]  And what do you think he had as an image on the presidential campaign?
[01:25:43.180 --> 01:25:48.460]  But a smoldering Capitol and the sign of just, you know, of unrest there and his promise
[01:25:48.460 --> 01:25:52.380]  to save democracy, which was the very theme that the process.
[01:25:52.380 --> 01:25:53.300]  So here's the bottom line.
[01:25:53.860 --> 01:25:56.340]  The listeners know it was a federal provocateur operation.
[01:25:56.340 --> 01:25:57.900]  They say, stop telling us what we already know.
[01:25:58.019 --> 01:25:59.300]  That's not what we're telling you, listeners.
[01:25:59.580 --> 01:26:04.500]  This is their blueprint and the official terrorism, anti-terrorism manifesto Biden put out
[01:26:04.660 --> 01:26:08.500]  in twenty twenty one in June that this is their plan to take the country over.
[01:26:08.620 --> 01:26:10.980]  And now they keep winning these cases.
[01:26:11.140 --> 01:26:15.140]  As you said, Norm, this this this is their this is their move.
[01:26:15.340 --> 01:26:17.260]  I'm really concerned about false flags.
[01:26:17.260 --> 01:26:20.860]  They're going to stage or provocateur actions of some real terror.
[01:26:20.860 --> 01:26:23.860]  They're going to blame on their opposition and blame on Trump.
[01:26:24.620 --> 01:26:28.780]  Well, they they may try, but I think Patriotism begins at home.
[01:26:28.940 --> 01:26:31.019]  And it's not a crime to believe in this country.
[01:26:31.019 --> 01:26:32.980]  It shouldn't be a crime to read the Constitution.
[01:26:33.059 --> 01:26:36.500]  It shouldn't be a crime to reach across the fence and shake your neighbor's hand and say,
[01:26:36.580 --> 01:26:37.620]  I believe in freedom.
[01:26:37.620 --> 01:26:42.100]  Do you? And I think we the people need to form powerful associations with one another
[01:26:42.180 --> 01:26:46.820]  and with shows like Infowars and we need to go and you and people do need to support the
[01:26:46.820 --> 01:26:49.500]  Infowars. People do need to support this show.
[01:26:49.660 --> 01:26:51.460]  Look at what happened to Tucker Carlson.
[01:26:51.580 --> 01:26:53.700]  I liked his voice, but he's gone.
[01:26:53.860 --> 01:26:57.900]  And depending on what you read, it's because he you know, he pissed off the people at Fox
[01:26:57.900 --> 01:26:59.059]  News for one reason or another.
[01:26:59.100 --> 01:27:02.820]  I think he just became he I think he got fed up and he started telling too much.
[01:27:02.820 --> 01:27:07.980]  I predicted on January, excuse me, I predicted on March 8th, he'd be fired within two
[01:27:07.980 --> 01:27:13.300]  months. And now there's a new video that he cut weeks ago for a big summit in Europe
[01:27:13.300 --> 01:27:15.500]  that he's not at predicting he'd be fired.
[01:27:15.700 --> 01:27:16.860]  I'll play that next segment.
[01:27:17.340 --> 01:27:21.019]  And I know exactly what happened with Tucker, but I'm not allowed to get into it.
[01:27:21.019 --> 01:27:23.460]  But you are. Where is he going to resurface, Alex?
[01:27:23.460 --> 01:27:25.019]  I'm dying to know. Are you able to say.
[01:27:26.820 --> 01:27:28.580]  All right. Well, I'm the one being interviewed.
[01:27:28.740 --> 01:27:31.059]  People shouldn't be holding their breath for him to go to.
[01:27:32.059 --> 01:27:37.420]  Patrick Ben David or whatever his name is, nice guy or or Newsmax, they shouldn't be
[01:27:37.420 --> 01:27:42.220]  letting me let me let me end with one note, I think people need to join the fully informed
[01:27:42.220 --> 01:27:46.780]  jury association. We need to bring back jury nullification in the United States and we
[01:27:46.780 --> 01:27:50.780]  need jurors to be able to decide not just the facts, but whether the law is being justly
[01:27:50.780 --> 01:27:53.940]  applied. I was stopped any number of times in my closing argument.
[01:27:53.940 --> 01:27:57.380]  There is even a disruptor in the gallery who was removed by the marshal.
[01:27:57.740 --> 01:28:02.220]  And I argued as close to the edge of nullification as I could and was stopped repeatedly by
[01:28:02.220 --> 01:28:07.100]  the judge. There was a time in this country when jurors got to decide not just the facts
[01:28:07.100 --> 01:28:10.180]  before them, but whether the law was appropriately applied.
[01:28:10.340 --> 01:28:13.980]  And when dissent from the citizens had a veto, only 30 seconds left.
[01:28:14.180 --> 01:28:16.660]  Closing comments. Steve Metcalf, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:28:17.380 --> 01:28:18.540]  Absolutely, Alex.
[01:28:18.540 --> 01:28:21.180]  Always a pleasure. It's always a pleasure to be near Norm.
[01:28:22.180 --> 01:28:27.340]  We need to take we need to have the facts of this case and the transcripts of this case
[01:28:27.340 --> 01:28:31.300]  actually exposed and out there for everybody, everybody.
[01:28:31.300 --> 01:28:33.580]  The appeal on this case is going to be massive.
[01:28:33.820 --> 01:28:38.860]  And that tool theory is going to change American jurisprudence forever.
[01:28:38.860 --> 01:28:40.180]  I firmly believe that.
[01:28:40.380 --> 01:28:43.100]  And this is only the beginning of the fight right here.
[01:28:43.100 --> 01:28:48.340]  And we have to be very vigilant and know what's coming, because this is they're not
[01:28:48.340 --> 01:28:49.380]  stopping. They're only building.
[01:28:49.820 --> 01:28:51.700]  Real quick, you have a Twitter where people find you.
[01:28:52.980 --> 01:28:54.900]  Metcalf Law, NYC.
[01:28:55.059 --> 01:28:56.420]  I do have a Twitter.
[01:28:56.780 --> 01:28:58.220]  I do have an Instagram.
[01:28:58.820 --> 01:29:00.900]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[01:29:01.380 --> 01:29:03.580]  Please write this down and please go look this up.
[01:29:03.620 --> 01:29:05.220]  It will change your life.
[01:29:05.660 --> 01:29:10.300]  The U.N. admits and the Lansing Medical Journal admits that upwards of two billion people
[01:29:10.300 --> 01:29:14.420]  have mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities.
[01:29:14.460 --> 01:29:19.340]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[01:29:19.740 --> 01:29:23.500]  Most iodine in the environment is bound to other elements.
[01:29:23.500 --> 01:29:24.900]  So your body can't absorb it.
[01:29:25.380 --> 01:29:29.580]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[01:29:29.900 --> 01:29:36.300]  And InfoWarsTore.com has the only iodine out there that actually has this type of full
[01:29:36.340 --> 01:29:39.700]  effect. Ladies and gentlemen, X3 has been sold out for six months.
[01:29:40.059 --> 01:29:41.220]  It's very hard to produce.
[01:29:41.420 --> 01:29:43.139]  And it's finally back in stock.
[01:29:43.580 --> 01:29:45.500]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[01:29:45.900 --> 01:29:47.940]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is powerful.
[01:29:48.180 --> 01:29:49.340]  You and your family need it.
[01:29:49.540 --> 01:29:51.260]  It's 25 percent off back in stock.
[01:29:51.620 --> 01:29:55.700]  X3. Try iodine exclusively at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:29:55.940 --> 01:29:58.500]  Take action now. But regardless, research is info.
[01:29:58.620 --> 01:30:03.620]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution is laying right there in front of you, hidden
[01:30:03.620 --> 01:30:07.260]  in plain view. Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[01:30:07.860 --> 01:30:11.940]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the U.N.'s own website where they admit the
[01:30:11.940 --> 01:30:17.020]  number one cause of cognitive disability in the world is iodine deficiency.
[01:30:17.460 --> 01:30:24.820]  The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability is lack of real, pure iodine in
[01:30:24.820 --> 01:30:30.180]  the body as they bomb us with the bad halogens, bromine, bromide, chlorine and so much
[01:30:30.180 --> 01:30:36.700]  more. Upwards of two billion people in a Lancet medical journal study in 2007 worldwide
[01:30:36.700 --> 01:30:40.740]  have cognitive disabilities because they don't have high quality iodine.
[01:30:40.940 --> 01:30:42.460]  Most iodine is bound to other elements.
[01:30:42.460 --> 01:30:46.540]  You don't absorb it. We have X3, all three types of good iodine together.
[01:30:47.100 --> 01:30:48.580]  It supercharges your body.
[01:30:48.900 --> 01:30:51.540]  X3 is now back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:30:51.700 --> 01:30:54.700]  It's being sold out for over six months for 25 percent off.
[01:30:54.940 --> 01:30:56.139]  X3 back in stock.
[01:30:56.300 --> 01:30:58.420]  Take action now. InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:30:58.460 --> 01:31:02.100]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[01:31:06.780 --> 01:31:09.820]  I want you all to know something, Alex Jones was right.
[01:31:09.940 --> 01:31:13.500]  Alex is right about far more than he's wrong.
[01:31:13.580 --> 01:31:16.500]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[01:31:16.620 --> 01:31:20.500]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down.
[01:31:20.820 --> 01:31:22.660]  Alex Jones was right.
[01:31:23.139 --> 01:31:26.500]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[01:31:26.580 --> 01:31:30.340]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[01:31:30.340 --> 01:31:34.139]  Alex Jones called this years ago, years ago.
[01:31:34.260 --> 01:31:37.380]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[01:31:38.380 --> 01:31:40.860]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[01:31:40.900 --> 01:31:43.340]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[01:31:43.340 --> 01:31:46.460]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:48.300]  That's why the globalists hate me,
[01:31:48.300 --> 01:31:51.260]  is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[01:31:58.620 --> 01:32:00.420]  I want to thank all of you over the years
[01:32:00.420 --> 01:32:03.460]  who have supported InfoWars financially with word of mouth and prayer.
[01:32:04.180 --> 01:32:06.780]  All the success that we've had together against the globalists,
[01:32:06.780 --> 01:32:10.460]  the fact that we're not caught flat footed during their major takeover
[01:32:10.620 --> 01:32:11.820]  is because of you.
[01:32:11.820 --> 01:32:14.260]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.
[01:32:14.820 --> 01:32:17.780]  I just want to thank you all for buying products at InfoWarsStore.com
[01:32:17.780 --> 01:32:21.580]  like books and films and supplements and water filtration, air filtration, so much more.

[01:32:45.460 --> 01:32:49.900]  to take action now and be part of the global awakening, the new renaissance.
[01:32:50.139 --> 01:32:53.500]  Let's counter the Great Reset by going to InfoWarsStore.com
[01:32:53.660 --> 01:32:55.860]  and clicking on the Donate button and giving today.
[01:32:56.059 --> 01:32:58.220]  Thank you so much for your support. Please take action.
[01:33:07.210 --> 01:33:14.210]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:38.210 --> 01:33:42.210]  Alright, I just spent an hour on January 6th,
[01:33:42.210 --> 01:33:45.210]  because it's all come to a head now,
[01:33:45.210 --> 01:33:49.210]  and we're not going to lie to you, it's a big victory for the police state,
[01:33:49.210 --> 01:33:52.210]  for the weaponized judiciary.
[01:33:52.210 --> 01:33:55.210]  We're having a lot of victories as well in the hearts and minds,
[01:33:55.210 --> 01:33:58.210]  but the enemy controls the bureaucracy and the infrastructure.
[01:33:58.210 --> 01:34:00.210]  They're attacking us at every level, annihilating our borders,
[01:34:00.210 --> 01:34:03.210]  shipping in drugs, attacking our children,
[01:34:03.210 --> 01:34:05.210]  persecuting people that defend themselves,
[01:34:05.210 --> 01:34:07.210]  the case here in Austin,
[01:34:07.210 --> 01:34:10.210]  where the man aims an AK-47 at him,
[01:34:10.210 --> 01:34:12.210]  and the veteran shoots him.
[01:34:12.210 --> 01:34:14.210]  Veteran, no criminal record.
[01:34:14.210 --> 01:34:16.210]  Hell, war hero.
[01:34:16.210 --> 01:34:21.210]  Active duty, having to have another job just to pay the bills.
[01:34:21.210 --> 01:34:23.210]  You're supposed to let somebody point an AK-47 at you.
[01:34:23.210 --> 01:34:26.210]  Kind of like this Uber Eats driver last week in Florida,
[01:34:26.210 --> 01:34:28.210]  he'd done like 30 deliveries.
[01:34:28.210 --> 01:34:30.210]  Last delivery of the night, 2 a.m.,
[01:34:30.210 --> 01:34:33.210]  MS-13 guy takes him, steals his money,
[01:34:33.210 --> 01:34:35.210]  executes him, dismembers him.
[01:34:35.210 --> 01:34:40.210]  I guess when MS-13 pointed a gun at him, he should have not fought back.
[01:34:40.210 --> 01:34:43.210]  I guess he didn't, he got killed.
[01:34:43.210 --> 01:34:45.210]  And we now know what happened with this case
[01:34:45.210 --> 01:34:48.210]  of this mentally ill, schizophrenic black man
[01:34:48.210 --> 01:34:51.210]  who had been arrested 40 times, more than 20 of them,
[01:34:51.210 --> 01:34:56.210]  for aggravated assault and battery.
[01:34:56.210 --> 01:34:59.210]  40 arrests.
[01:34:59.210 --> 01:35:02.210]  And it turns out the full video, we can show it,
[01:35:02.210 --> 01:35:04.210]  I guess we'll get to it next hour.
[01:35:04.210 --> 01:35:06.210]  A black guy, a Hispanic guy, and a white guy,
[01:35:06.210 --> 01:35:08.210]  when he's threatening to kill him,
[01:35:08.210 --> 01:35:09.210]  we have all these videos of him now,
[01:35:09.210 --> 01:35:11.210]  it turns out there were like warnings by him in the subway,
[01:35:11.210 --> 01:35:12.210]  warnings online.
[01:35:12.210 --> 01:35:16.210]  If you see the Michael Jackson impersonator, look out.
[01:35:16.210 --> 01:35:18.210]  This guy starts charging him, pushing him, attacking him,
[01:35:18.210 --> 01:35:21.210]  saying, I'll kill you.
[01:35:21.210 --> 01:35:25.210]  I don't care if I'm going to die.
[01:35:25.210 --> 01:35:28.210]  And so the black guy starts wrestling him because he got in his face,
[01:35:28.210 --> 01:35:30.210]  and the white guy jumps in to help the black guy,
[01:35:30.210 --> 01:35:34.210]  and now he's a white supremacist who just murdered a black guy for fun.
[01:35:34.210 --> 01:35:41.210]  No, he was a big, powerful, 6'3", schizophrenic.
[01:35:41.210 --> 01:35:43.210]  And I'll tell you, I've been to New York a lot,
[01:35:43.210 --> 01:35:45.210]  and it's always been bad.
[01:35:45.210 --> 01:35:47.210]  When I was a kid, we went there, it was super dangerous.
[01:35:47.210 --> 01:35:50.210]  Giuliani, not a perfect guy, but he cleaned it up.
[01:35:50.210 --> 01:35:53.210]  And since then, I'm a tough guy.
[01:35:53.210 --> 01:35:55.210]  I mean, I'm not the toughest around, but I don't want trouble.
[01:35:55.210 --> 01:35:59.210]  I'm not getting on the New York subway for all the money in the world.
[01:35:59.210 --> 01:36:03.210]  It's a freaking underground lunatic asylum.
[01:36:03.210 --> 01:36:07.210]  There's human feces and needles and crazy people,
[01:36:07.210 --> 01:36:12.210]  black, white, running around like maniacs.
[01:36:12.210 --> 01:36:17.210]  And this guy was arrested 40 times.
[01:36:18.420 --> 01:36:29.460]  And yeah, you put somebody in a chokehold, sometimes they never wake up.
[01:36:29.460 --> 01:36:33.980]  But AOC comes out and says, it's a white supremacist attack.
[01:36:33.980 --> 01:36:37.460]  He was killed because he was black and poor and calls for demonstrations and even the
[01:36:37.460 --> 01:36:40.580]  black mayor says, stop it.
[01:36:40.580 --> 01:36:42.260]  You don't know the facts.
[01:36:42.260 --> 01:36:43.500]  Stop it.
[01:36:43.500 --> 01:36:46.140]  But they want another George Floyd, folks.
[01:36:46.140 --> 01:36:47.620]  They want another George Floyd.
[01:36:47.620 --> 01:36:48.620]  Everybody's happy.
[01:36:48.620 --> 01:36:50.860]  The schizophrenics dead.
[01:36:50.860 --> 01:36:56.100]  They got rid of the eighties of the funding for state mental institutions and now anybody
[01:36:56.100 --> 01:37:00.740]  that's been in a big city knows it's an open air mental institution.
[01:37:00.740 --> 01:37:05.740]  Every week or so I have to dodge some crazy schizophrenic run across the road.
[01:37:05.740 --> 01:37:09.780]  You'll see a black man run across the road, a white man run across the road, an old lady,
[01:37:09.780 --> 01:37:10.780]  an old white lady.
[01:37:10.780 --> 01:37:15.780]  Just a couple of days ago, I'm driving down Ben White.
[01:37:15.780 --> 01:37:21.700]  I'm driving down 71 in the middle of Austin, 70 miles an hour as a speed limit.
[01:37:21.700 --> 01:37:29.700]  And a naked woman looked like she was about 65 years old, runs across the road in front
[01:37:29.700 --> 01:37:31.260]  of like three cars in front of me.
[01:37:31.260 --> 01:37:35.380]  They almost hit her.
[01:37:35.380 --> 01:37:39.980]  We literally live in a lunatic asylum.
[01:37:39.980 --> 01:37:44.420]  This morning I go get gas in a nice area of Austin, it's not super nice, but it's a nice
[01:37:44.420 --> 01:37:45.420]  area.
[01:37:46.060 --> 01:37:51.140]  I step out of my car, there's a pile of human feces right there.
[01:37:51.140 --> 01:38:00.180]  I decide this morning that I want some food, so I pull over at a breakfast place and there's
[01:38:00.180 --> 01:38:10.140]  another pile of crap by the door, it's a lunatic asylum.
[01:38:10.140 --> 01:38:14.660]  It's a open air lunatic asylum.
[01:38:14.660 --> 01:38:16.140]  You say, why do you live in Austin?
[01:38:16.140 --> 01:38:21.900]  Well, my family's been here since the 1820s and this is where the infrastructure is built
[01:38:21.900 --> 01:38:25.540]  and I don't have the money to move this someplace.
[01:38:25.540 --> 01:38:28.300]  Believe me, I want to, because it's dangerous.
[01:38:28.300 --> 01:38:36.420]  I still love the town, I grew up here, but yeah, we're looking.
[01:38:36.420 --> 01:38:41.620]  That's why I've got offers in Florida to work with somebody else, I've got a lot of offers,
[01:38:41.620 --> 01:38:46.780]  but I'm loyal to the crew and I'm going to stay here as long as I can.
[01:38:46.780 --> 01:38:50.060]  But it's so sad to see the fall of your city.
[01:38:50.060 --> 01:38:54.580]  And Austin is a paradise compared to New York.
[01:38:54.580 --> 01:39:04.500]  I was in New York twice the last two years and man, it is surreal, needles, garbage, feces
[01:39:04.500 --> 01:39:07.860]  and gay pride flags everywhere.
[01:39:07.860 --> 01:39:15.700]  And just, I mean, I was there about a year ago to be on a big podcast.
[01:39:15.700 --> 01:39:21.660]  I was on Michael Malice's podcast and I was on Schultz's podcast, The Comedian.
[01:39:21.660 --> 01:39:33.940]  And I thought I was in the twilight zone, piss, crap, needles everywhere, pools of piss
[01:39:33.940 --> 01:39:38.580]  everywhere, crazy people running around like zombies and little kids marching with rainbow
[01:39:38.580 --> 01:39:39.580]  flags.
[01:39:39.580 --> 01:39:41.740]  And I was just, last time I was there was like gay pride month or something.
[01:39:41.740 --> 01:39:46.140]  It was just like, I'm living in a fricking twilight zone, man.
[01:39:46.140 --> 01:39:50.660]  These are cursed cities and I've got all this news I want to hit.
[01:39:50.660 --> 01:39:57.180]  We'll take calls next hour, get the number out next segment, but this is a planned takedown
[01:39:57.180 --> 01:40:01.980]  of civilization and I got a bunch of articles I'm going to hit next segment, but let's play
[01:40:01.980 --> 01:40:02.980]  this clip.
[01:40:03.900 --> 01:40:09.780]  In pre-recorded message, Tucker Carlson predicted his own ouster from Fox News this week in
[01:40:09.780 --> 01:40:12.020]  Europe, in Hungary.
[01:40:12.020 --> 01:40:14.580]  They're having CPAC Europe.
[01:40:14.580 --> 01:40:20.100]  And so he taped this, it looks like the Thursday before he was fired, so about two weeks ago,
[01:40:20.100 --> 01:40:23.940]  I guess two weeks ago, exactly now.
[01:40:23.940 --> 01:40:29.740]  And it's prophetic because he says, I'm fired next time I'll be with you.
[01:40:29.740 --> 01:40:31.460]  So this, I told you this will all come out.
[01:40:31.460 --> 01:40:32.780]  I mean, Tucker knew it was coming.
[01:40:33.580 --> 01:40:34.980]  He wasn't sure at the exact same time.
[01:40:34.980 --> 01:40:41.620]  He came over to visit me, came over to the house and, uh, you know, um, and Thanksgiving
[01:40:41.620 --> 01:40:46.780]  and we had a long conversation, a couple of our conversation, but that's all a private
[01:40:46.780 --> 01:40:47.780]  conversation.
[01:40:47.780 --> 01:40:53.260]  Other conversations are private, but he knew it was coming and that just makes him cooler
[01:40:53.260 --> 01:40:54.260]  because he didn't back down.
[01:40:54.260 --> 01:40:58.340]  I'm not going to say why I got fired other than to say everything he did is why I got
[01:40:58.340 --> 01:40:59.340]  fired.
[01:40:59.580 --> 01:41:04.500]  And like Roger Stone, as soon as we said a week ago, he got fired because they were scared
[01:41:04.500 --> 01:41:07.820]  of what he was going to do next.
[01:41:07.820 --> 01:41:09.700]  Same reason they want me off air, but here's the deal.
[01:41:09.700 --> 01:41:13.140]  I don't work for Spotify or Fox News.
[01:41:13.140 --> 01:41:14.940]  I got my own operation.
[01:41:14.940 --> 01:41:19.020]  The only reason this dog hunts is because of you.
[01:41:19.020 --> 01:41:24.140]  So go to infowarestore.com, X3, the incredible tri-item, those incredible things, your whole
[01:41:24.140 --> 01:41:25.700]  body that is the missing link.

[01:41:37.540 --> 01:41:40.860]  We're selling out of Real Red Pill Plus that's over the top incredible.
[01:41:40.860 --> 01:41:42.820]  The Fountain of Youth, it was close to get to it.
[01:41:42.820 --> 01:41:44.180]  It's 40% off.
[01:41:44.180 --> 01:41:47.540]  That sale is about to end sometime next week.
[01:41:47.540 --> 01:41:48.540]  So many great products.

[01:41:50.980 --> 01:41:52.700]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:41:52.700 --> 01:41:59.140]  Let's go to break with Tucker Carlson predicting his firing in his last days at Fox that just
[01:41:59.140 --> 01:42:00.140]  aired.
[01:42:00.140 --> 01:42:01.140]  Here it is.
[01:42:01.140 --> 01:42:04.380]  Greetings to CPAC Hungary and to all you Americans in the audience.
[01:42:04.380 --> 01:42:06.020]  You are very brave.
[01:42:06.020 --> 01:42:09.300]  You have landed up on one of Samantha Power's lists.
[01:42:09.300 --> 01:42:11.020]  The State Department is keeping track.
[01:42:11.020 --> 01:42:13.300]  You went to a forbidden country.
[01:42:13.300 --> 01:42:14.820]  I wish I was there in Budapest.
[01:42:14.820 --> 01:42:19.740]  If I ever get fired and have some time and can leave, I will be there with you.
[01:42:19.740 --> 01:42:21.500]  But in the meantime, Godspeed.
[01:42:21.500 --> 01:42:24.580]  We are thinking of you and cheering you on.
[01:42:32.580 --> 01:42:34.500]  Are you going to lay down and take it?
[01:42:34.500 --> 01:42:36.900]  Because here's the bottom line.
[01:42:36.900 --> 01:42:39.860]  Laying down and taking it only makes it worse.
[01:42:39.860 --> 01:42:44.100]  I don't agree with the Japanese that if rape is inevitable, enjoy it.
[01:42:44.100 --> 01:42:48.820]  If rape's inevitable, bite their dick off.
[01:42:48.900 --> 01:42:50.900]  That's what I tell my daughters.
[01:42:50.900 --> 01:42:52.900]  Somebody attacks you, kill them.
[01:42:52.900 --> 01:42:53.900]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:53.900 --> 01:42:54.900]  Stay with us.
[01:42:59.900 --> 01:43:02.900]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[01:43:02.900 --> 01:43:04.900]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[01:43:04.900 --> 01:43:08.900]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[01:43:08.900 --> 01:43:12.900]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, the people behind the scenes, the researchers,
[01:43:12.900 --> 01:43:17.900]  the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[01:43:17.980 --> 01:43:21.980]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in
[01:43:21.980 --> 01:43:26.980]  every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[01:43:26.980 --> 01:43:29.980]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[01:43:29.980 --> 01:43:35.980]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[01:43:35.980 --> 01:43:36.980]  I know you spread the word.
[01:43:36.980 --> 01:43:37.980]  I know you pray for us.
[01:43:37.980 --> 01:43:38.980]  And that's wonderful.
[01:43:38.980 --> 01:43:39.980]  Keep doing it.
[01:43:39.980 --> 01:43:42.980]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:43:42.980 --> 01:43:45.980]  And you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[01:43:46.060 --> 01:43:48.060]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[01:43:48.060 --> 01:43:52.060]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:43:52.060 --> 01:43:57.060]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsStore.com, our funding problems
[01:43:57.060 --> 01:43:58.060]  will be over.
[01:43:58.060 --> 01:43:59.060]  Please take action now.
[01:43:59.060 --> 01:44:01.060]  There is a war for the future happening right now.
[01:44:01.060 --> 01:44:06.060]  There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny, our children's destinies.
[01:44:06.060 --> 01:44:09.060]  And that war is something that we can win.
[01:44:09.060 --> 01:44:10.060]  But it takes dedication.
[01:44:10.060 --> 01:44:11.060]  It takes commitment.
[01:44:11.140 --> 01:44:16.140]  That's why I ask listeners respectfully to go to InfoWarsStore.com and buy great products
[01:44:16.140 --> 01:44:22.140]  that will enrich and empower your life while keeping us on air at the very same time.
[01:44:22.140 --> 01:44:28.140]  InfoWarsStore.com to get a signed or unsigned copy of my book, The Great Reset and War for
[01:44:28.140 --> 01:44:34.140]  the World, Ultimate Bone Broth, Back in Stock, Nitric Boost, the amazing CBD oil we have
[01:44:34.140 --> 01:44:38.140]  that's the highest quality you're going to find anywhere at more than half off.
[01:44:38.140 --> 01:44:40.140]  It's all available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:44:40.220 --> 01:44:42.220]  Some of the very best products.
[01:44:42.220 --> 01:44:44.220]  And a lot of you have never shopped at InfoWarsStore.
[01:44:44.220 --> 01:44:47.220]  You've been watching for years, you've been listening for years, but you've never taken
[01:44:47.220 --> 01:44:49.220]  the step to go to InfoWarsStore.
[01:44:49.220 --> 01:44:52.220]  These are great products that really work and are amazing.
[01:44:52.220 --> 01:44:54.220]  Plus, they keep us on air.
[01:44:54.220 --> 01:44:55.220]  So again, please take action.
[01:44:55.220 --> 01:44:58.220]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com today and I thank you.
[01:44:58.220 --> 01:45:03.220]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products

[01:45:58.380 --> 01:46:02.380]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[01:46:06.380 --> 01:46:09.380]  I want you all to know something, Alex Jones was right.
[01:46:09.380 --> 01:46:13.380]  Alex is right about far more things wrong.
[01:46:13.380 --> 01:46:16.380]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[01:46:16.380 --> 01:46:22.380]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down, Alex Jones was right.
[01:46:22.380 --> 01:46:26.380]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[01:46:26.380 --> 01:46:30.380]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[01:46:30.380 --> 01:46:34.380]  Alex Jones called this years ago, years ago.
[01:46:34.460 --> 01:46:37.460]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[01:46:37.460 --> 01:46:40.460]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[01:46:40.460 --> 01:46:43.460]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[01:46:43.460 --> 01:46:46.460]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[01:46:46.460 --> 01:46:51.460]  That's why the globalists hate me, it's because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[01:46:57.090 --> 01:47:05.090]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:31.120]  Yippee-i-yay, yippee-i-oh, ghost riders in the sky.
[01:47:32.120 --> 01:47:36.120]  An old cow hope went riding out one dark and windy day.
[01:47:36.120 --> 01:47:39.120]  Yippee-i-yay, yippee-i-oh.
[01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:45.120]  Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way.
[01:47:45.120 --> 01:47:48.120]  When all at once a mighty bunch of red-eyed cows he saw
[01:47:48.120 --> 01:47:56.120]  plowing through the ragged skies.
[01:47:56.120 --> 01:48:00.120]  And up a cloud he drove.
[01:48:00.120 --> 01:48:14.120]  Yippee-i-yay, yippee-i-oh, ghost riders in the sky.
[01:48:31.120 --> 01:48:36.120]  That we're also going to be getting to.
[01:48:36.120 --> 01:48:39.120]  And so you can bring up any topic you want,
[01:48:39.120 --> 01:48:44.120]  but all I ask you to do is first try to give me the answer to the quiz.
[01:48:44.120 --> 01:48:50.120]  It's my opinion, but it's my view of what this means.
[01:48:50.120 --> 01:48:53.120]  And whoever wins it gets a free T-shirt,
[01:48:53.120 --> 01:48:59.120]  either a Trump political prisoner shirt or an Alex Jones for President shirt.
[01:48:59.120 --> 01:49:04.120]  Just give us your address, the size you want, we'll mail it to you.
[01:49:04.120 --> 01:49:08.120]  We'll also throw in a copy of my book,
[01:49:08.120 --> 01:49:11.120]  The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[01:49:11.120 --> 01:49:15.120]  For whoever answers this question, this is a very important question,
[01:49:15.120 --> 01:49:20.120]  and the real reason for the quiz and the real reason for the game is to get
[01:49:20.120 --> 01:49:25.120]  everybody using their noggins to ask this question to yourself,
[01:49:25.120 --> 01:49:28.120]  and I think you know the answer.
[01:49:28.120 --> 01:49:30.120]  Will it take two calls, will it take ten calls to get the answer?
[01:49:30.120 --> 01:49:33.120]  You can just give me your answer, whether it's wrong or right,
[01:49:33.120 --> 01:49:37.120]  and then make your point, but every caller has to give me your take on this.
[01:49:40.120 --> 01:49:43.120]  Who declares, that's the World Health Organization,
[01:49:43.120 --> 01:49:46.120]  and the Marxist-Communist Ethiopia that killed over a million people,
[01:49:46.120 --> 01:49:49.120]  total Chinese front man,
[01:49:49.120 --> 01:49:53.120]  who declares end to COVID global public health emergency?
[01:49:53.120 --> 01:49:56.120]  Why are they doing that?
[01:49:56.380 --> 01:50:04.380]  And let me put a cap on it. I'll take 10 calls and if somebody hadn't figured it
[01:50:04.380 --> 01:50:07.380]  out after 10 calls, I'll give you the answer. Because I'm not sure you're gonna
[01:50:07.380 --> 01:50:13.540]  get the answer. It's a profound answer. It's how my brain works. And I told
[01:50:13.540 --> 01:50:17.900]  friends and family that when you see this happen,
[01:50:19.220 --> 01:50:22.740]  you think this is good?
[01:50:21.080 --> 01:50:32.760]  Not going to give me more hints, WHO declares end to COVID global public health emergency.
[01:50:32.760 --> 01:50:41.720]  Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General of the World Health Organization, said the
[01:50:41.720 --> 01:50:45.600]  spread of COVID is no longer a global health public emergency.
[01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:49.400]  The World Health Organization declared on Friday, for more than a year the pandemic has been
[01:50:49.400 --> 01:50:54.640]  on the downward trend, the population immunity increasing for vaccination and infection,
[01:50:54.640 --> 01:51:00.760]  mortality decreasing, and the presence of health systems easing, WHO director said and
[01:51:00.760 --> 01:51:02.760]  declared it over.
[01:51:02.760 --> 01:51:07.320]  Why are they declaring it over now?
[01:51:07.320 --> 01:51:13.000]  And what's in the SPARS document, that when it came out the shot didn't work and was deadly,
[01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:18.600]  they would then start having public health officials resign three years into the pandemic,
[01:51:18.600 --> 01:51:22.800]  and then they would use all the lawsuits that came out of that to bankrupt the countries
[01:51:22.800 --> 01:51:28.080]  and the vaccine makers have liability protection.
[01:51:28.080 --> 01:51:33.880]  CDC Director Walensky announces departure today.
[01:51:33.880 --> 01:51:38.400]  Whence Walensky, who served as the CDC director since the beginning of the Biden presidency
[01:51:38.400 --> 01:51:43.640]  in 2021, has saved lives with her steadfast and unwavering focus on the health of every
[01:51:43.640 --> 01:51:44.640]  American.
[01:51:44.640 --> 01:51:47.559]  President Biden said today, she's announced today that she'll leave her post at the end
[01:51:47.559 --> 01:51:53.320]  of June for CDC announcement.
[01:51:53.320 --> 01:51:58.840]  Why are they announcing the end of COVID?
[01:51:58.840 --> 01:52:04.360]  Why are they doing that?
[01:52:04.360 --> 01:52:08.720]  And if you know the answer to that, you know the answer to everything.
[01:52:08.720 --> 01:52:14.240]  US intelligence is covering up the fact that it knew about COVID-19 in November 2019.
[01:52:14.240 --> 01:52:16.280]  Knew about it?
[01:52:16.280 --> 01:52:18.080]  They created it.
[01:52:18.080 --> 01:52:19.400]  That's come out in Congress.
[01:52:19.150 --> 01:52:43.870]  So the toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539, 877-789-Alex, 877-789-2539.
[01:52:43.870 --> 01:52:47.469]  You can cover any topic you want, any issue I've raised, any issue I haven't raised, it's
[01:52:47.469 --> 01:52:48.469]  a free-for-all.
[01:52:48.469 --> 01:52:54.269]  But you first got to give me the answer, or what you think the answer is, and I'm not
[01:52:54.269 --> 01:52:59.230]  poo-pooing your answer, I'm not saying I'm right completely, though I know that I am
[01:52:59.230 --> 01:53:03.110]  in the general sense.
[01:53:03.110 --> 01:53:08.950]  I know why they did it, and if you understand that, you understand a lot.
[01:53:08.950 --> 01:53:14.070]  I really want to see if you can come up with the answer, 877-789-2539.
[01:53:14.070 --> 01:53:20.469]  The frustration is thousands will try to call in, only a few will get on, and I'm sure some
[01:53:20.469 --> 01:53:23.230]  of you out there right now know the answer.
[01:53:23.230 --> 01:53:31.429]  But the whole point is this processes, this process of getting people to think.
[01:53:31.429 --> 01:53:37.490]  Why is their big power grab, their big U.N. operation, the thing that gives them their
[01:53:37.490 --> 01:53:43.070]  world ID and their control, all of it, their social credit score, their vaccine passport,
[01:53:43.070 --> 01:53:46.429]  why are they saying they're key to power?
[01:53:46.520 --> 01:53:51.240]  He's no longer there.
[01:53:51.240 --> 01:53:54.000]  Well, there's a lot of reasons that lead up to that.
[01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:57.960]  We're not buying into it, and people know the shot doesn't work, and almost no one's
[01:53:57.960 --> 01:53:58.960]  taking it.
[01:53:58.960 --> 01:53:59.960]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:53:59.960 --> 01:54:00.960]  We know all that.
[01:54:00.960 --> 01:54:01.960]  They were going to push us as far as they could.
[01:54:01.960 --> 01:54:06.080]  If they could take over with just this, they'd have done it.
[01:54:06.080 --> 01:54:07.080]  But it's failed.
[01:54:07.080 --> 01:54:11.440]  I'm giving you a lot of hints here.
[01:54:11.440 --> 01:54:17.720]  Let's see if you can answer the question.
[01:54:17.720 --> 01:54:21.760]  Let's see if you've got the answer, 877-789-ALEX.
[01:54:21.760 --> 01:54:26.760]  All right, let's do this now.
[01:54:26.760 --> 01:54:31.400]  Since we're talking about ways they are attacking us, not just the poison shots, but the rest
[01:54:31.400 --> 01:54:35.440]  of it, let's look at a couple more of these stories.
[01:54:35.440 --> 01:54:45.880]  Fentanyl overdose deaths skyrocketed 279% in just the last six years.
[01:54:45.880 --> 01:54:52.560]  It's now the number one cause of death below the age of 45.
[01:54:52.560 --> 01:54:54.320]  Hundreds of thousands a year die.
[01:54:54.320 --> 01:54:58.320]  They say it's 100,000, but they think only a fraction ever get diagnosed that it was
[01:54:58.320 --> 01:55:05.680]  fentanyl with the coroners, with the pathologists.
[01:55:05.680 --> 01:55:08.680]  Big article on InfoWars.com.
[01:55:08.680 --> 01:55:10.240]  So let's shift gears over here.
[01:55:10.240 --> 01:55:13.480]  Oh, look at this.
[01:55:13.480 --> 01:55:17.760]  University slammed for erasing the word woman from its paternity and
[01:55:17.960 --> 01:55:26.080]  menopause policies. We'll cover that coming up but let's let's look more at
[01:55:26.080 --> 01:55:28.280]  this.
[01:55:26.750 --> 01:55:34.750]  Mental strain. Marijuana may be behind a 30% of schizophrenia that's off the charts.
[01:55:34.750 --> 01:55:40.750]  Cases in young men. Major National Institutes of Health, that's the UK, funded study suggests.
[01:55:40.750 --> 01:55:47.750]  I remember telling Joe Rogan on his show like six years ago that schizophrenia was exploding because of marijuana.
[01:55:47.750 --> 01:55:51.750]  He didn't know it then. Since then he's researched and seen a lot of his friends go crazy on it.
[01:55:51.750 --> 01:55:59.750]  But here's a study that the weaponized super strong marijuana is a hallucinogen and is causing serious mental illness.
[01:55:59.750 --> 01:56:05.750]  What else are they pushing? Mobile phone use increases heart attacks and stroke risk, study claims.
[01:56:05.750 --> 01:56:10.750]  Because you don't walk outside as much. You don't move around as much.
[01:56:10.750 --> 01:56:14.750]  It also electromagnetically is toxic. There's a lot of reasons this is going on.
[01:56:14.750 --> 01:56:18.750]  This is out of the Express newspaper of UK.
[01:56:18.750 --> 01:56:24.750]  Researchers claim people who spend 30 minutes talking on their mobile phone a week have a higher risk of stroke and heart attacks.
[01:56:24.750 --> 01:56:28.750]  A team of scientists, what's an electromagnetic microwave relay tower?
[01:56:28.750 --> 01:56:38.750]  A team of scientists and radio waves emitted by the endemic devices can cause high blood pressure in users a prolonged period of time.
[01:56:38.750 --> 01:56:44.750]  Experts said data shows those taking on a cell phone for 30 minutes talking on a cell phone 30 minutes or more a week
[01:56:44.750 --> 01:56:49.750]  had a 12% risk of a higher condition than those who spent less time chatting.
[01:56:49.750 --> 01:56:58.750]  Yes, they are microwave ovens held to your head.
[01:56:58.750 --> 01:57:02.750]  All right, let's talk about Woody Allen when we come back.
[01:57:02.750 --> 01:57:08.750]  And Jeffrey Epstein on the CIA director and the Mossad director and the head of MI6.
[01:57:08.750 --> 01:57:16.750]  That's all coming up next hour with so much other news we've not gotten into yet.
[01:57:16.750 --> 01:57:25.750]  Plus all the worship of the British who aren't even British royals with the coronation of the king that is imminent.
[01:57:25.750 --> 01:57:31.750]  It's all coming up today in our number three.
[01:57:31.750 --> 01:57:32.750]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:57:32.750 --> 01:57:34.750]  The Coordinates of Liberty.
[01:57:34.750 --> 01:57:35.750]  Arm.
[01:57:35.750 --> 01:57:36.750]  Band.
[01:57:36.750 --> 01:57:37.750]  Video.
[01:57:37.750 --> 01:57:38.750]  Infowars.com.
[01:57:38.750 --> 01:57:39.750]  Newswars.com.
[01:57:39.750 --> 01:57:42.750]  And of course, Madmaxworld.tv.
[01:57:42.750 --> 01:57:45.750]  Madmaxworld.tv.
[01:57:46.280 --> 01:57:51.580]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[01:57:51.580 --> 01:57:53.639]  Please write this down and please go look this up.
[01:57:53.639 --> 01:57:55.679]  It will change your life.
[01:57:55.679 --> 01:58:00.160]  The UN admits and the Lansing Medical Journal admits that upwards of two billion people
[01:58:00.160 --> 01:58:04.400]  have mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities.
[01:58:04.400 --> 01:58:09.920]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[01:58:09.920 --> 01:58:15.639]  Most iodine in the environment is bound to other elements so your body can't absorb it.
[01:58:15.639 --> 01:58:19.960]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[01:58:19.960 --> 01:58:26.240]  And Infowarsstore.com has the only iodine out there that actually has this type of full
[01:58:26.240 --> 01:58:27.240]  effect.
[01:58:27.240 --> 01:58:30.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3's been sold out for six months.
[01:58:30.080 --> 01:58:33.000]  It's very hard to produce and it's finally back in stock.
[01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:36.059]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[01:58:36.059 --> 01:58:38.240]  This ladies and gentlemen is powerful.
[01:58:38.240 --> 01:58:39.559]  You and your family need it.
[01:58:39.559 --> 01:58:41.759]  It's 25% off back in stock.
[01:58:41.759 --> 01:58:42.759]  X3.
[01:58:42.759 --> 01:58:46.080]  Try iodine exclusively at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:58:46.080 --> 01:58:47.080]  Take action now.
[01:58:47.080 --> 01:58:48.960]  But regardless, research is info.
[01:58:48.960 --> 01:58:50.639]  Turbo Force is back.
[01:58:50.639 --> 01:58:53.759]  Sold out for eight months and it's Turbo Force Plus.
[01:58:53.759 --> 01:58:55.920]  We made it even stronger.
[01:58:55.920 --> 01:58:59.840]  The strongest long term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[01:58:59.840 --> 01:59:06.559]  Turbo Force is back in stock at Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:59:06.559 --> 01:59:12.599]  It's not just wide spectrum natural herbs that time release over 10 hours.
[01:59:12.599 --> 01:59:14.719]  It should be called 10 hour energy.
[01:59:14.719 --> 01:59:20.200]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids
[01:59:20.200 --> 01:59:25.080]  that turbo charge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you
[01:59:25.080 --> 01:59:26.080]  name it.
[01:59:26.080 --> 01:59:29.759]  It is the super fuel.
[01:59:29.759 --> 01:59:31.240]  Rain Force Plus is great.
[01:59:31.240 --> 01:59:32.240]  Rain Force Ultra is great.
[01:59:32.240 --> 01:59:33.240]  They're two different nootropics.
[01:59:33.240 --> 01:59:34.240]  They go good with this.
[01:59:34.240 --> 01:59:37.120]  But this is the King Kong.
[01:59:37.120 --> 01:59:38.120]  This is the boss.
[01:59:38.120 --> 01:59:39.120]  Turbo Force.
[01:59:39.120 --> 01:59:40.120]  Back in stock.
[01:59:40.120 --> 01:59:41.120]  Discounted.
[01:59:41.120 --> 01:59:42.120]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:59:42.120 --> 01:59:43.120]  More power.
[01:59:43.120 --> 01:59:44.120]  More strength.
[01:59:44.120 --> 01:59:45.120]  More energy.
[01:59:45.120 --> 01:59:56.120]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:59:56.120 --> 02:00:02.960]  I want to talk to you about something right now.
[02:00:02.960 --> 02:00:04.679]  That can and will change your life.
[02:00:04.679 --> 02:00:07.440]  It's changed my life and millions of other people's lives.
[02:00:07.440 --> 02:00:08.440]  In fact, billions.
[02:00:08.440 --> 02:00:11.320]  Some for the better, some for the worse.
[02:00:11.320 --> 02:00:13.120]  I'm talking about iodine deficiency.
[02:00:13.120 --> 02:00:18.200]  Now, this is a very complex issue, but in the next few minutes, I want to try to boil it
[02:00:18.200 --> 02:00:19.200]  down for you.
[02:00:19.200 --> 02:00:26.120]  I have Wikipedia right here with links to the UN itself admitting that over 2 billion
[02:00:26.120 --> 02:00:32.759]  people have intellectual disability, lower IQs, psychological problems, neurological
[02:00:32.759 --> 02:00:39.120]  issues because of lack of iodine, particularly when they're developing and growing as children,
[02:00:39.120 --> 02:00:40.719]  but also throughout life.
[02:00:40.719 --> 02:00:47.200]  Now, most iodine that's in food is bound to other elements, so your body cannot absorb
[02:00:47.200 --> 02:00:48.440]  it.
[02:00:48.440 --> 02:00:53.040]  Atomic iodine is pure, deep-earth crystal iodine, and until we started selling it about
[02:00:53.040 --> 02:00:57.480]  12 years ago, nobody else in the world was doing that.
[02:00:57.480 --> 02:01:01.280]  There are other types of iodine that are not pure atomic, that are very close to it, that
[02:01:01.280 --> 02:01:05.440]  are also good for the body and help with the absorption of regular atomic or nascent
[02:01:05.440 --> 02:01:06.639]  iodine.
[02:01:06.639 --> 02:01:12.800]  That's why with top researchers, we developed X3 that has a deep-earth crystal iodine and
[02:01:12.800 --> 02:01:16.360]  two other types of iodine in it as well for better absorption.
[02:01:16.360 --> 02:01:20.120]  It's been sold out for many, many months, but now we got a big shipment of it in to
[02:01:20.120 --> 02:01:25.599]  Infowarsstore.com right now, and it's 25% off.
[02:01:25.599 --> 02:01:30.559]  I want to encourage everybody to go to the encyclopedia, to go to medical literature,
[02:01:30.559 --> 02:01:31.559]  go wherever you want.
[02:01:31.559 --> 02:01:35.320]  Wikipedia is not always accurate, but you can check the bibliography here, the links.
[02:01:35.320 --> 02:01:40.679]  This is an accurate report right here from the UN, from major studies, you name it, about
[02:01:40.679 --> 02:01:48.920]  iodine deficiency being the number one cause worldwide of what they call intellectual disability.
[02:01:48.920 --> 02:01:54.639]  If you look here on page two, it says, while reporting recent progress towards overcoming
[02:01:54.639 --> 02:01:59.040]  iodine deficiency disorders worldwide, the Lancet Medical Journal noted that the World
[02:01:59.040 --> 02:02:05.920]  Health Organization in 2007, nearly two billion individuals had insufficient iodine intake,
[02:02:05.920 --> 02:02:08.280]  a third being school age.
[02:02:08.280 --> 02:02:13.260]  And it goes on, the conclusion was made that the single most preventable case of intellectual
[02:02:13.260 --> 02:02:16.639]  disability is that of iodine deficiency.
[02:02:16.639 --> 02:02:22.760]  The single biggest reason people are so dumb and IQs worldwide are dropping like a lead
[02:02:22.760 --> 02:02:25.760]  balloon is iodine deficiency.
[02:02:25.760 --> 02:02:30.760]  Now, there was massive IQ dropping and massive deformities in the 20s and 30s.
[02:02:30.760 --> 02:02:35.160]  So the US government, as well as other governments said, by law, we're going to put it in the
[02:02:35.160 --> 02:02:40.440]  salt and we're going to encourage bakeries and companies that sell flour to put some
[02:02:40.440 --> 02:02:43.480]  iodine in it.
[02:02:43.480 --> 02:02:46.559]  IQs exploded up to 15 points on average in just a few years.
[02:02:46.559 --> 02:02:52.799]  Then in the 80s, they took it out and in this own report from Wikipedia, they admit that
[02:02:52.799 --> 02:03:02.840]  they put in things that counter the iodine, like bromide, bromine, and other things instead
[02:03:02.840 --> 02:03:08.000]  of the iodine that you need when the other chemicals are toxic.
[02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:11.360]  This is absolutely insane.
[02:03:11.360 --> 02:03:16.200]  So ladies and gentlemen, get X3 back in stock, consult your physician before you use it,
[02:03:16.200 --> 02:03:20.799]  because if you already have thyroid issues, there could be some issues, but find out about
[02:03:20.799 --> 02:03:24.920]  the power of triiodine in your body.
[02:03:24.920 --> 02:03:28.960]  Go to mfulworthstore.com, read about it, consult your physician or healthcare provider,
[02:03:28.960 --> 02:03:30.799]  and then get a bottle of it.
[02:03:30.799 --> 02:03:35.120]  It usually takes, when you're deficient, about two weeks for you to feel the effects.
[02:03:35.120 --> 02:03:38.200]  After about two weeks on average, you'll feel a little bit groggy and weird for a few days,
[02:03:38.200 --> 02:03:41.360]  and then all of a sudden, boom, you feel younger.
[02:03:41.360 --> 02:03:42.360]  You feel stronger.
[02:03:42.360 --> 02:03:45.799]  Things just for your skin, your body, your libido, your energy, your electrochemical
[02:03:45.799 --> 02:03:48.840]  activities in your brain is simply incredible.
[02:03:48.840 --> 02:03:53.960]  So it's finally back in stock, X3, mfulworthstore.com.
[02:03:53.960 --> 02:03:56.880]  Stock up on it, because I don't know when we're going to be able to have it again, and
[02:03:56.880 --> 02:03:59.360]  your purchase of X3 funds our operation.
[02:03:59.360 --> 02:04:02.160]  And while you're there, get other great products that are so good for your brain and your
[02:04:02.160 --> 02:04:07.360]  cells and your nerves, like our ultimate krill oil, and of course, our 10-hour clean, powerful
[02:04:07.360 --> 02:04:15.080]  energy, and that is TurboForce, mfulworthstore.com, X3, back in stock.
[02:04:15.080 --> 02:04:19.059]  We hope to have it in the future, but it's been sold out for more than six months.
[02:04:19.059 --> 02:04:25.519]  It's very hard to produce it, but it is now available to you and your family yet again.
[02:04:25.519 --> 02:04:28.639]  Experience the power of triiodine.
[02:04:28.639 --> 02:04:31.120]  Do your research, and then make the decision now.
[02:04:31.120 --> 02:04:36.559]  We have the best iodine out there, the highest quality iodine out there.
[02:04:36.559 --> 02:04:41.780]  Please go to mfulworthstore.com today and get your X3.
[02:04:41.780 --> 02:04:47.500]  If you make one decision with supplementation out there, it should be with products like
[02:04:47.500 --> 02:04:48.900]  X3.
[02:04:48.900 --> 02:04:51.219]  There's nothing else like this, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:04:51.219 --> 02:04:58.380]  It's waiting for you exclusively at mfulworthstore.com, or by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[02:04:58.380 --> 02:04:59.380]  Check it out.
[02:04:59.380 --> 02:05:04.059]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution is laying right there in front of you, hidden
[02:05:04.059 --> 02:05:05.700]  in plain view.
[02:05:05.700 --> 02:05:08.460]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[02:05:08.460 --> 02:05:12.740]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website, where they admit the number
[02:05:12.740 --> 02:05:17.980]  one cause of cognitive disability in the world is iodine deficiency.
[02:05:17.980 --> 02:05:25.260]  The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability is lack of real, pure iodine in
[02:05:25.260 --> 02:05:31.580]  the body, as they bomb us with the bad halogens, bromine, bromide, chlorine, and so much more.
[02:05:31.580 --> 02:05:37.260]  Upwards of two billion people in a Lancet Medical Journal study in 2007 worldwide have
[02:05:37.260 --> 02:05:41.460]  cognitive disabilities because they don't have high-quality iodine.
[02:05:41.460 --> 02:05:42.940]  Most iodine is bound to other elements.
[02:05:42.940 --> 02:05:43.940]  You don't absorb it.
[02:05:43.940 --> 02:05:49.340]  We have X3, all three types of good iodine together that supercharges your body.
[02:05:49.340 --> 02:05:51.740]  X3 is now back in stock at mfulworthstore.com.
[02:05:51.740 --> 02:05:55.380]  It's been sold out for over six months for 25% off.
[02:05:55.380 --> 02:05:56.780]  X3, back in stock.

[02:06:08.260 --> 02:06:13.260]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:06:13.260 --> 02:06:16.260]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:06:34.260 --> 02:06:36.860]  Alright, we're taking your calls in the order that they came in.
[02:06:36.860 --> 02:06:47.860]  We're going to Michelle, Rusty, David, Eric, Derek, Terry, Buzz, Matt, Lusumbio, Gabe,
[02:06:47.860 --> 02:06:49.860]  Michael, and others.
[02:06:49.860 --> 02:06:52.860]  But first off, Michelle in New York.
[02:06:52.860 --> 02:06:54.860]  We're having the quiz.
[02:06:54.860 --> 02:06:58.860]  The WHO declares end of COVID global public health emergency.
[02:06:58.860 --> 02:07:01.860]  Again, I'm not saying this is the perfect answer.
[02:07:01.860 --> 02:07:03.860]  I'm not saying it's 100%.
[02:07:03.860 --> 02:07:07.860]  I believe it's being done for a certain reason.
[02:07:07.860 --> 02:07:10.860]  What do you think that is?
[02:07:10.860 --> 02:07:14.860]  I'm not nearly as intelligent as you, Alex.
[02:07:14.860 --> 02:07:15.860]  God bless you.
[02:07:15.860 --> 02:07:17.860]  But it's a distraction.
[02:07:17.860 --> 02:07:18.860]  End of story.
[02:07:18.860 --> 02:07:21.860]  Whatever it's for, it's an absolute distraction.
[02:07:21.860 --> 02:07:28.860]  Whether that's the climate lockdown or CBCD, I can't keep up with all the little acronyms anymore.
[02:07:28.860 --> 02:07:30.860]  Or the huge global banking meltdown.
[02:07:31.860 --> 02:07:35.860]  I don't think any answer is wrong because it's for a lot of reasons.
[02:07:35.860 --> 02:07:37.860]  I think that you're close to it, but that's not the answer.
[02:07:37.860 --> 02:07:39.860]  What is your view on New York City?
[02:07:39.860 --> 02:07:40.860]  What's happening there?
[02:07:40.860 --> 02:07:43.860]  I'm going to try to do this without crying.
[02:07:43.860 --> 02:07:45.860]  So I'm in show business.
[02:07:45.860 --> 02:07:46.860]  I've lived here.
[02:07:46.860 --> 02:07:47.860]  I'm born and raised.
[02:07:47.860 --> 02:07:51.860]  My entire life, I live at the foot of one of the bridges, which will go unnamed.
[02:07:51.860 --> 02:07:58.860]  When you spoke so beautifully of Austin and why you're not leaving, I can relate to that.
[02:07:58.860 --> 02:08:00.860]  It was so eloquent when you spoke of that.
[02:08:00.860 --> 02:08:03.860]  Like I said, I'm born and raised here.
[02:08:03.860 --> 02:08:06.860]  And believe you me, I own property here.
[02:08:06.860 --> 02:08:07.860]  I own the house I live in.
[02:08:07.860 --> 02:08:12.860]  I had a rental property I say had because it's almost been stolen.
[02:08:12.860 --> 02:08:18.860]  This is the ground zero experiment for what they want to do in every single way.
[02:08:18.860 --> 02:08:19.860]  We are flooded with immigrants.
[02:08:19.860 --> 02:08:20.860]  God bless them.
[02:08:20.860 --> 02:08:23.860]  They were lured and manipulated here.
[02:08:24.860 --> 02:08:25.860]  A lot of them.
[02:08:25.860 --> 02:08:28.860]  I mean, some of them we know might be criminals.
[02:08:28.860 --> 02:08:35.860]  I cannot imagine how this city is not intrinsically changed within just the next handful of years
[02:08:35.860 --> 02:08:39.860]  because we're saturated and they have nowhere to go.
[02:08:39.860 --> 02:08:40.860]  So that's one thing.
[02:08:40.860 --> 02:08:44.860]  Your description of the trains.
[02:08:44.860 --> 02:08:45.860]  I don't take the subway.
[02:08:45.860 --> 02:08:46.860]  I drive everywhere.
[02:08:46.860 --> 02:08:47.860]  Everyone laughs at me.
[02:08:47.860 --> 02:08:52.860]  Now it's very difficult to do that because they want us out of our cars.
[02:08:52.860 --> 02:08:54.860]  There are bike lanes everywhere.
[02:08:54.860 --> 02:08:59.860]  During COVID, they took the opportunity to put them literally everywhere.
[02:08:59.860 --> 02:09:04.860]  So my house, we used to be able to park, is now a highway of bike lanes.
[02:09:04.860 --> 02:09:09.860]  The thing you don't hear spoken of too much is commercial landlords.
[02:09:09.860 --> 02:09:11.860]  And I know, boo-hoo, not all landlords are bad.
[02:09:11.860 --> 02:09:15.860]  They don't want private ownership in this city, for sure.
[02:09:15.860 --> 02:09:18.860]  They did the eviction moratorium.
[02:09:18.860 --> 02:09:20.860]  That went on until the beginning of this year.
[02:09:20.860 --> 02:09:22.860]  A lot of people don't talk about this.
[02:09:22.860 --> 02:09:28.860]  In New York, the eviction moratorium was not lifted until just four or five months ago.
[02:09:28.860 --> 02:09:34.860]  So I had a tenant for three years not paying rent, okay, and wouldn't give me the keys back.
[02:09:34.860 --> 02:09:39.860]  And I only just got it back having to pay a mortgage for two and a half years without any income.
[02:09:39.860 --> 02:09:42.860]  There was no assistance or relief for commercial landlords.
[02:09:42.860 --> 02:09:46.860]  There was no assistance or relief for the property taxes, which are—
[02:09:46.860 --> 02:09:54.860]  Sure, remember, the CDC tried to say no more rents forever, which, again, would collapse society.
[02:09:54.860 --> 02:09:58.860]  Right, my commercial property happens to be in AOC's district.
[02:09:58.860 --> 02:10:04.860]  And he told me, AOC told me, my tenant, I don't have to pay rent.
[02:10:04.860 --> 02:10:08.860]  And, you know, let me tell you, the courts upheld that.
[02:10:08.860 --> 02:10:11.860]  It's totally designed to collapse society.
[02:10:11.860 --> 02:10:12.860]  Incredible call.
[02:10:12.860 --> 02:10:13.860]  Got to move the next person.
[02:10:13.860 --> 02:10:14.860]  Thank you so much.
[02:10:14.860 --> 02:10:15.860]  Thank you so much.
[02:10:15.860 --> 02:10:16.860]  Rusty in Colorado.
[02:10:16.860 --> 02:10:24.860]  Do you know why I believe the WHO declared an end to the COVID global pandemic health emergency?
[02:10:24.860 --> 02:10:27.860]  I believe I do, Mr. Jones.
[02:10:27.860 --> 02:10:31.860]  I believe that the WHO wants to strip away our sovereignty.
[02:10:31.860 --> 02:10:37.860]  And when we start prosecuting people based on what they said for treason, they're going to come and occupy us.
[02:10:37.860 --> 02:10:41.860]  And then we'll never, we'll never get rid of them.
[02:10:41.860 --> 02:10:43.860]  Okay, but let me ask you a question.
[02:10:43.860 --> 02:10:45.860]  Sure, they've got the WHO treaty.
[02:10:45.860 --> 02:10:48.860]  You're right, they're taking over our medical system, trying to take over our body.
[02:10:48.860 --> 02:10:55.860]  But if the source of their power is the COVID emergency, why would they be ending it?
[02:10:55.860 --> 02:11:04.860]  So that the people who refuse to give amnesty to the ones that, you know, enforced all of this on us, okay,
[02:11:04.860 --> 02:11:12.860]  they'll see that as a militant action, like we're in a new state of emergency and that we can't save ourselves from it.
[02:11:12.860 --> 02:11:15.860]  So they'll come here and they'll occupy us.
[02:11:15.860 --> 02:11:17.860]  And that'll be that.
[02:11:17.860 --> 02:11:18.860]  There goes our sovereignty.
[02:11:18.860 --> 02:11:19.860]  We'll never get it back.
[02:11:19.860 --> 02:11:20.860]  All right.
[02:11:20.860 --> 02:11:22.860]  Well, there is a U.N. takeover of our sovereignty.
[02:11:22.860 --> 02:11:23.860]  You're dead right about that.
[02:11:23.860 --> 02:11:25.860]  But that is not the answer.
[02:11:25.860 --> 02:11:27.860]  You wanted to say something else?
[02:11:27.860 --> 02:11:28.860]  Yes.
[02:11:28.860 --> 02:11:31.860]  My sister, she was on Adderall for a long time.
[02:11:31.860 --> 02:11:36.860]  And when the shortages happened, I went and got her a three-month supply of the Brain Force Plus.
[02:11:36.860 --> 02:11:40.860]  And at this point, she's not even taking the Adderall anymore.
[02:11:40.860 --> 02:11:43.860]  She's using Brain Force Plus almost daily.
[02:11:43.860 --> 02:11:46.860]  What does she think of it?
[02:11:46.860 --> 02:11:48.860]  She likes it.
[02:11:48.860 --> 02:11:51.860]  You know, she took advantage of the sales.
[02:11:51.860 --> 02:11:54.860]  I told her to jump on it before it ends this week.
[02:11:54.860 --> 02:11:59.860]  You know, I heard somebody, I don't know, maybe last week say that the sale is going to end soon.
[02:11:59.860 --> 02:12:04.860]  Of course, I bought myself some Red Pill also.
[02:12:05.860 --> 02:12:06.860]  Well, I appreciate your support.
[02:12:06.860 --> 02:12:12.860]  But definitely, there are natural, healthy stimulants that are way better than the ones that are being pushed on people.
[02:12:12.860 --> 02:12:15.860]  And I would say never get into stimulants, period, that aren't natural.
[02:12:15.860 --> 02:12:20.860]  But once you've been on artificial ones, it's a must to have the natural ones.
[02:12:20.860 --> 02:12:25.860]  So, folks, we'll check out the real Red Pill, Brain Force Plus, Brain Force Ultra, and Turbo Force.
[02:12:25.860 --> 02:12:27.860]  Thank you so much for calling, Rusty.
[02:12:27.860 --> 02:12:28.860]  All right.
[02:12:28.860 --> 02:12:29.860]  David in Wisconsin.
[02:12:30.860 --> 02:12:37.860]  Again, the quiz is not what the answer is.
[02:12:37.860 --> 02:12:44.860]  But what does Alex Jones think the reason is the U.N. has announced the end of their COVID power grab?
[02:12:44.860 --> 02:12:54.860]  I think the reason Alex Jones thinks the World Health Organization declares an end to the global health emergency is because
[02:12:54.860 --> 02:12:58.860]  Title 42 is suspected to end next week.
[02:12:58.860 --> 02:13:09.860]  And that's going to open the floodgates of tens of thousands of illegals, untested, unvaccinated people to just rush our border.
[02:13:09.860 --> 02:13:11.860]  And they can't test them.
[02:13:11.860 --> 02:13:13.860]  And that's what I think you think.
[02:13:13.860 --> 02:13:16.860]  That is a great angle.
[02:13:16.860 --> 02:13:18.860]  And all of your answers are right.
[02:13:18.860 --> 02:13:20.860]  I'm not just being like everybody gets a trophy.
[02:13:20.860 --> 02:13:21.860]  All these answers are correct.
[02:13:21.860 --> 02:13:22.860]  It's all part of a larger reason.
[02:13:22.860 --> 02:13:28.860]  But there's a larger reason they are doing this.
[02:13:28.860 --> 02:13:31.860]  There's a larger reason they're saying it.
[02:13:31.860 --> 02:13:34.860]  And I'm going to get to that if ten callers cannot figure it out.
[02:13:34.860 --> 02:13:35.860]  Yeah.
[02:13:35.860 --> 02:13:37.860]  I'm honestly looking forward to your answer.
[02:13:37.860 --> 02:13:43.860]  And another reason I called in is I listened to yesterday's show with you.
[02:13:43.860 --> 02:13:47.860]  And you were talking about Prank Salon.
[02:13:47.860 --> 02:14:00.860]  He made that disgusting deep fake of Tucker Carlson's voice and was saying some really horrible things about like really just gross things to you in Tucker Carlson's voice.
[02:14:00.860 --> 02:14:05.860]  But according to Prank Salon's Twitter, he was arrested two hours ago.
[02:14:05.860 --> 02:14:13.860]  And they have a nice photo of him being hauled out in handcuffs by some agent with a badge on his coat.
[02:14:13.860 --> 02:14:20.860]  So just a little FYI to people being disgusting and trying to imitate.
[02:14:20.860 --> 02:14:22.860]  I mean, Tucker is such an honorable person.
[02:14:22.860 --> 02:14:24.860]  Trying to imitate him and, you know.
[02:14:24.860 --> 02:14:26.860]  Is that a joke?
[02:14:26.860 --> 02:14:27.860]  Guys, guys, go look.
[02:14:27.860 --> 02:14:28.860]  No, no, no.
[02:14:28.860 --> 02:14:29.860]  Pull up his Twitter right now, Alex.
[02:14:29.860 --> 02:14:30.860]  No, no.
[02:14:30.860 --> 02:14:31.860]  I'm not denying you're wrong.
[02:14:31.860 --> 02:14:32.860]  That's just.
[02:14:32.860 --> 02:14:33.860]  Look, look.
[02:14:33.860 --> 02:14:37.860]  When I said he should be arrested, it's because he made a big joke about it.
[02:14:37.860 --> 02:14:41.860]  He literally stole that idea of somebody's phone number like swatting.
[02:14:42.860 --> 02:14:44.860]  Programmed Tucker Carlson's number in.
[02:14:44.860 --> 02:14:52.860]  Called me and then said sexually aggressive things, which an average person wouldn't know that was fake.
[02:14:52.860 --> 02:14:54.860]  I figured it out pretty quick.
[02:14:54.860 --> 02:14:56.860]  But it's very aggressive.
[02:14:56.860 --> 02:14:58.860]  I think that's identity theft.
[02:14:58.860 --> 02:14:59.860]  I have the same here.
[02:14:59.860 --> 02:15:00.860]  Same here.
[02:15:00.860 --> 02:15:01.860]  I think that as well.
[02:15:01.860 --> 02:15:07.860]  According to Twitter, his mom posted on his Twitter, this is Prank's mother, Pranika.
[02:15:07.860 --> 02:15:08.860]  I don't know if that's real or not.
[02:15:08.860 --> 02:15:10.860]  That name just seems fake to me.
[02:15:10.860 --> 02:15:15.860]  But according to his mother, he was arrested and it does show a photo of him being arrested.
[02:15:15.860 --> 02:15:16.860]  So.
[02:15:17.860 --> 02:15:18.860]  All right, brother.
[02:15:18.860 --> 02:15:19.860]  We're going to go to break.
[02:15:19.860 --> 02:15:20.860]  We'll have to look into that.
[02:15:24.860 --> 02:15:25.860]  I don't know this is real.
[02:15:25.860 --> 02:15:26.860]  It may be him joking around.
[02:15:26.860 --> 02:15:27.860]  It looks like somebody.
[02:15:27.860 --> 02:15:28.860]  Go ahead.
[02:15:31.860 --> 02:15:32.860]  Yeah, thanks so much, Alex.
[02:15:32.860 --> 02:15:33.860]  God bless.
[02:15:33.860 --> 02:15:34.860]  Thank you.
[02:15:34.860 --> 02:15:35.860]  I appreciate your call.
[02:15:35.860 --> 02:15:36.860]  All right.
[02:15:36.860 --> 02:15:39.860]  We'll be right back on the other side.
[02:15:39.860 --> 02:15:45.860]  Why are they announcing the end of the U.N. COVID power grab?
[02:15:45.860 --> 02:15:47.860]  Why are they doing that?
[02:15:47.860 --> 02:15:51.860]  Terry, Buzz, Matt, everybody else, your calls are straight ahead.
[02:15:51.860 --> 02:15:52.860]  Stay with us.
[02:15:57.860 --> 02:16:03.860]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire food supply.
[02:16:04.860 --> 02:16:12.860]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element, which has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[02:16:12.860 --> 02:16:15.860]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[02:16:15.860 --> 02:16:18.860]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[02:16:18.860 --> 02:16:27.860]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally keep the soil rich with iodine.
[02:16:28.860 --> 02:16:38.860]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the Earth's surface.
[02:16:38.860 --> 02:16:44.860]  Our InfoWars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[02:16:44.860 --> 02:16:53.860]  Pure nascent iodine stabilized in an activated triiodine form for a healthy thyroid and a healthy metabolism.

[02:16:57.860 --> 02:17:01.860]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government.
[02:17:01.860 --> 02:17:05.860]  A flying disk has been found and is now in the possession of the Army.
[02:17:05.860 --> 02:17:07.860]  Here is a bulletin from CBS News.
[02:17:07.860 --> 02:17:09.860]  President Kennedy has been shot.
[02:17:09.860 --> 02:17:13.860]  This is a different kind of war.
[02:17:13.860 --> 02:17:17.860]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and torpedoes.
[02:17:17.860 --> 02:17:21.860]  The CIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[02:17:21.860 --> 02:17:25.860]  They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[02:17:25.860 --> 02:17:27.860]  It was almost as if there were a plan in motion.
[02:17:27.860 --> 02:17:29.860]  It got tank headed.
[02:17:29.860 --> 02:17:31.860]  We need to go into the capital.
[02:17:31.860 --> 02:17:33.860]  Death, death, death.
[02:17:33.860 --> 02:17:35.860]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[02:17:35.860 --> 02:17:37.860]  They are nothing but distraction.
[02:17:37.860 --> 02:17:39.860]  You guys censored Harvard educated doctors.
[02:17:39.860 --> 02:17:41.860]  You silenced those voices.
[02:17:41.860 --> 02:17:45.860]  What we want to do in Davos is push the reset button.
[02:17:45.860 --> 02:17:51.860]  As soon as we start exposing the Great Reset, the sooner these globalists start going to prison.
[02:17:55.860 --> 02:18:03.860]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to Infowarsstore.com
[02:18:03.860 --> 02:18:07.860]  and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that empower your immune system and your body,
[02:18:07.860 --> 02:18:09.860]  and keep us on air.
[02:18:09.860 --> 02:18:15.860]  I am humbly, hand in hand, talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in, many of you for years,
[02:18:15.860 --> 02:18:17.860]  and never gone to Infowarsstore.com.
[02:18:17.860 --> 02:18:21.860]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you
[02:18:21.860 --> 02:18:23.860]  never actually go to Infowarsstore.com
[02:18:23.860 --> 02:18:25.860]  and never experienced these great products
[02:18:25.860 --> 02:18:27.860]  and never found the operation.
[02:18:27.860 --> 02:18:29.860]  Sure, you share a link, you share an article, you tell folks about the show.
[02:18:29.860 --> 02:18:31.860]  That's great, and I thank you.
[02:18:31.860 --> 02:18:33.860]  But we need funds to operate.
[02:18:33.860 --> 02:18:35.860]  Plus, we've got really great products that do amazing things for people,
[02:18:35.860 --> 02:18:37.860]  like our CBD oil, and our fizzy magnesium,
[02:18:37.860 --> 02:18:39.860]  and our sleep aid, and our nitric oxide,
[02:18:39.860 --> 02:18:41.860]  and our real red pill.
[02:18:41.860 --> 02:18:43.860]  Plus, all of these are really great products that keep us on air.
[02:18:43.860 --> 02:18:45.860]  Plus, you're missing out on having these products.
[02:18:45.860 --> 02:18:47.860]  So, get off the bench.
[02:18:47.860 --> 02:18:49.860]  Get in the game.
[02:18:49.860 --> 02:18:51.860]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now
[02:18:51.860 --> 02:18:53.860]  and get these great Infowars products
[02:18:53.860 --> 02:18:55.860]  at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:19:19.860 --> 02:19:21.860]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse-engineered
[02:19:21.860 --> 02:19:23.860]  the fancy best water filter system out there
[02:19:23.860 --> 02:19:25.860]  that sells for twice the price,
[02:19:25.860 --> 02:19:27.860]  and they made it as good
[02:19:27.860 --> 02:19:29.860]  in all the studies.
[02:19:29.860 --> 02:19:31.860]  It reduces things to non-detectable levels,
[02:19:31.860 --> 02:19:33.860]  thousands of chemicals.
[02:19:33.860 --> 02:19:35.860]  But you can go pay two or three times.
[02:19:35.860 --> 02:19:37.860]  There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[02:19:37.860 --> 02:19:39.860]  We sell the very best, highest-grade water filtration system
[02:19:39.860 --> 02:19:41.860]  for half the price to a leading competitor.
[02:19:41.860 --> 02:19:43.860]  And the media says we're bad
[02:19:43.860 --> 02:19:45.860]  and a cult
[02:19:45.860 --> 02:19:47.860]  for telling you you should filter your water.
[02:19:47.860 --> 02:19:49.860]  You should also filter your shower water.
[02:19:49.860 --> 02:19:51.860]  That's another way you absorb this crap.
[02:19:51.860 --> 02:19:53.860]  But I'm done talking about that.
[02:19:53.860 --> 02:19:55.860]  The point is, you get the filters at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:19:55.860 --> 02:19:57.860]  They're discounted right now.
[02:19:57.860 --> 02:19:59.860]  Finally back in stock.
[02:19:59.860 --> 02:20:01.860]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[02:20:01.860 --> 02:20:03.860]  of the New World Order.
[02:20:03.860 --> 02:20:05.860]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:20:06.310 --> 02:20:24.789]  New York professor says having a white nuclear family promotes white supremacy.
[02:20:24.789 --> 02:20:27.630]  Professor tweets that white people should commit mass suicide.
[02:20:27.630 --> 02:20:31.529]  College professor says kill cops, kill all white people, and kill the straights.
[02:20:31.529 --> 02:20:34.269]  Professor says all I want for Christmas is white genocide.
[02:20:34.269 --> 02:20:36.869]  Georgetown professor says all white people are racist.
[02:20:36.869 --> 02:20:39.789]  Trinity college professor calls white people inhuman.
[02:20:39.789 --> 02:20:41.350]  Let them f***ing die.
[02:20:41.350 --> 02:20:45.630]  College professor says believing in hard work is a white ideology.
[02:20:45.630 --> 02:20:49.090]  College professor says white people are conditioned to commit mass murder.
[02:20:49.090 --> 02:20:51.910]  A professor equates math with white privilege.
[02:20:51.910 --> 02:20:56.910]  A professor says white supremacist patriarchy is responsible for the Vegas shooting.
[02:20:56.910 --> 02:20:59.390]  Professors hold a white racism course at FGCU.
[02:20:59.390 --> 02:21:03.590]  USC professor calls for a holocaust against all white people.
[02:21:03.590 --> 02:21:07.990]  Professor says I'll teach my children to be cautious and distrust friendship with white
[02:21:07.990 --> 02:21:08.990]  people.
[02:21:08.990 --> 02:21:12.130]  Baltimore professor says white people need to personally give all of their money to
[02:21:12.130 --> 02:21:13.130]  black people.
[02:21:13.130 --> 02:21:17.230]  College professor says some white people may have to die to solve racism.
[02:21:17.230 --> 02:21:20.710]  College professor says white masculinity is a problem for America.
[02:21:20.710 --> 02:21:23.510]  Georgetown professor says all white people are racist.
[02:21:23.510 --> 02:21:29.470]  Rutgers professor was taken to the NYC hospital for psychiatric evaluation after he tweeted
[02:21:29.470 --> 02:21:31.109]  threatening to kill white people.
[02:21:31.109 --> 02:21:35.710]  White professor calls all white people to mass suicide because of slavery.
[02:21:35.710 --> 02:21:39.189]  Here's a slide from a college classroom that says white tears on a mug.
[02:21:39.189 --> 02:21:42.910]  Here's another slide from a college classroom that says white people stay colonizing.
[02:21:42.910 --> 02:21:44.869]  White privilege does exist.
[02:21:44.869 --> 02:21:49.470]  Big f***ing unicorns, reverse racism, what do they all have in common?
[02:21:49.470 --> 02:21:51.630]  Stating that reverse racism isn't real.
[02:21:51.630 --> 02:21:53.630]  Y'all white people are dangerous.
[02:21:53.630 --> 02:21:56.869]  The horror story says white people are a plague to the planet.
[02:21:56.869 --> 02:21:58.949]  Here's one that says white people are crazy.
[02:21:58.949 --> 02:22:05.150]  And finally, how white people plague society.
[02:22:05.150 --> 02:22:11.070]  So breaking medical examiner rules, repeat violent offender Jordan Neely's death a homicide
[02:22:11.070 --> 02:22:17.510]  as New York City braces for riots, 40 arrests, over half of them for assaulting people.
[02:22:17.510 --> 02:22:20.590]  Black white, you name it, assaulting people on the train.
[02:22:20.590 --> 02:22:26.029]  A black man tackled him, the Hispanic man tried to help, a white Marine choked him and
[02:22:26.029 --> 02:22:31.109]  killed him because he was telling them, I'm going to kill you.
[02:22:31.109 --> 02:22:34.310]  You think these people wanted to do this?
[02:22:34.310 --> 02:22:42.070]  No, he's a mentally ill man that should be in a mental institution and I'm sad he's dead.
[02:22:42.070 --> 02:22:47.990]  But the media is seizing on that.
[02:22:47.990 --> 02:22:52.710]  I've got like 10 videos, literally 10 videos of him beating people up and attacking people.
[02:22:52.710 --> 02:22:57.269]  They put up advisories a decade ago about him.
[02:22:57.269 --> 02:23:04.150]  He's been going crazy that long and got killed.
[02:23:04.150 --> 02:23:08.590]  And none of us are better off because he's dead.
[02:23:08.590 --> 02:23:12.869]  But imagine if they showed all the footage of black people attacking white people and
[02:23:12.869 --> 02:23:16.750]  then said black people are to blame because a bad black person does something wrong.
[02:23:16.750 --> 02:23:20.470]  Just because a white person does something wrong or in this case defending themselves
[02:23:20.470 --> 02:23:21.470]  doesn't mean we're all bad.
[02:23:21.630 --> 02:23:24.830]  It's this idea that, oh, there were slaves hundreds of years ago, so we're all guilty.
[02:23:24.830 --> 02:23:28.630]  Most white people's ancestors immigrated here from countries that were involved in slavery.
[02:23:28.630 --> 02:23:32.869]  But again, if my daddy was a bank robber and served 20 years in jail, I'm not guilty for
[02:23:32.869 --> 02:23:35.869]  what my daddy did.
[02:23:35.869 --> 02:23:44.350]  But under authoritarianism, under fascism, under totalitarianism, under communism, you
[02:23:44.350 --> 02:23:46.750]  are guilty.
[02:23:46.750 --> 02:23:52.269]  In World War II, when the Nazis came through Eastern Europe, there's famous cases of this.
[02:23:52.269 --> 02:23:55.150]  If a regular troop got killed, they'd kill 20 people.
[02:23:55.150 --> 02:23:58.390]  If an officer got killed, they'd kill 100.
[02:23:58.390 --> 02:24:01.949]  They'd say, hey, somebody shot our officer and killed him.
[02:24:01.949 --> 02:24:03.869]  We're going to kill hundreds of you now.
[02:24:03.869 --> 02:24:12.550]  They put them in a church and burn it down.
[02:24:12.550 --> 02:24:13.550]  Look it up.
[02:24:14.350 --> 02:24:18.230]  Does that sound like a good system?
[02:24:18.230 --> 02:24:19.869]  You're great, great, great, great, great granddaddy.
[02:24:19.869 --> 02:24:22.189]  You don't even know supposedly did something wrong.
[02:24:22.189 --> 02:24:24.670]  So now you're guilty because you got a leg up because of that.
[02:24:24.670 --> 02:24:30.350]  What the hell does that mean?
[02:24:30.350 --> 02:24:35.630]  That's tyranny, ladies and gentlemen, and they're not trying to offer all these free
[02:24:35.630 --> 02:24:39.590]  deals and money to people because they love black people.
[02:24:39.590 --> 02:24:45.189]  Remember, remember, Biden three years ago promised free tuition for everybody, was going
[02:24:45.189 --> 02:24:48.189]  to forgive all student debt, and then he didn't do it.
[02:24:48.189 --> 02:24:50.590]  Oh, he signed a law but didn't implement it.
[02:24:50.590 --> 02:24:51.590]  It's all lies.
[02:24:51.590 --> 02:24:55.590]  They're not going to give you anything free.
[02:24:55.590 --> 02:24:58.869]  Anything you get is going to come with major strings attached.
[02:24:58.869 --> 02:25:02.550]  But I'm asking the big question here.
[02:25:02.550 --> 02:25:08.430]  Why has the U.N. and its big power grab ended the COVID crisis?
[02:25:08.430 --> 02:25:09.430]  I have the answer.
[02:25:10.269 --> 02:25:11.269]  I want to hear from you.
[02:25:11.269 --> 02:25:12.269]  Terry in Alaska.
[02:25:12.269 --> 02:25:13.269]  You're on the air.
[02:25:13.269 --> 02:25:14.269]  Go ahead.
[02:25:14.269 --> 02:25:15.269]  Yeah.
[02:25:15.269 --> 02:25:16.269]  Alex, can you hear me?
[02:25:16.269 --> 02:25:17.269]  I can.
[02:25:17.269 --> 02:25:18.269]  Go ahead.
[02:25:18.269 --> 02:25:19.269]  Yeah.
[02:25:19.269 --> 02:25:20.269]  I think it's one of two things.
[02:25:20.269 --> 02:25:23.230]  It's either their numbers are showing that nobody wants their poison anymore or they're
[02:25:23.230 --> 02:25:26.990]  getting ready to release the next bio weapon.
[02:25:26.990 --> 02:25:27.990]  Boom.
[02:25:27.990 --> 02:25:28.990]  He wins.
[02:25:28.990 --> 02:25:31.189]  Get his name, get his address.
[02:25:31.189 --> 02:25:36.869]  He gets a signed copy of the Great Reset and the War for the World, and he gets a choice
[02:25:36.869 --> 02:25:40.750]  of Trump, political prisoner shirt, or Alex Jones for president.
[02:25:40.750 --> 02:25:41.750]  You tell us what you want.
[02:25:41.750 --> 02:25:44.630]  Give us your address and make damn sure, Cruz, I'm going to start doing this prize thing
[02:25:44.630 --> 02:25:45.630]  almost every day.
[02:25:45.630 --> 02:25:46.630]  Can I say something else?
[02:25:46.630 --> 02:25:47.630]  Nope.
[02:25:47.630 --> 02:25:48.630]  Nope.
[02:25:48.630 --> 02:25:49.630]  Nope.
[02:25:49.630 --> 02:25:50.630]  First off, you win.
[02:25:50.630 --> 02:25:51.630]  Go ahead and make your point.
[02:25:51.630 --> 02:25:52.630]  Then we'll go back.
[02:25:52.630 --> 02:25:56.109]  I'm actually very impressed with the sixth caller I think we took.
[02:25:56.109 --> 02:25:57.109]  Got it.
[02:25:57.109 --> 02:25:58.109]  Go ahead.
[02:25:58.109 --> 02:25:59.109]  I'm very impressed.
[02:25:59.109 --> 02:26:00.109]  Go ahead.
[02:26:00.109 --> 02:26:04.710]  I'd like to see a guy named Paymon Mataheda on as a guest sometime, hopefully.
[02:26:04.710 --> 02:26:05.710]  Okay.
[02:26:05.710 --> 02:26:06.710]  Don't know who he is.
[02:26:07.550 --> 02:26:08.550]  Paymon.
[02:26:08.550 --> 02:26:09.550]  When you talk to him, get this written down, too.
[02:26:09.550 --> 02:26:10.550]  Hold on.
[02:26:10.550 --> 02:26:11.550]  Paymon who?
[02:26:11.550 --> 02:26:12.550]  Mataheda.
[02:26:12.550 --> 02:26:13.550]  Paymon Mataheda.
[02:26:13.550 --> 02:26:14.550]  Who is he?
[02:26:14.550 --> 02:26:15.550]  He's an Iranian-born citizen.
[02:26:15.550 --> 02:26:16.550]  Came to America in 94.
[02:26:16.550 --> 02:26:17.550]  Anyway, he's never paid taxes.
[02:26:17.550 --> 02:26:18.550]  He's fought the U.S. tax court and won.
[02:26:18.550 --> 02:26:19.550]  He hasn't paid taxes for 30 years.
[02:26:19.550 --> 02:26:20.550]  All right.
[02:26:20.550 --> 02:26:21.550]  We'll get him on.
[02:26:21.550 --> 02:26:22.550]  You got my promise.
[02:26:22.550 --> 02:26:23.550]  If he can be gotten on, we'll get him on.
[02:26:23.550 --> 02:26:42.430]  I didn't come up with an easy one, and I'm extremely impressed by our audience that thousands
[02:26:42.430 --> 02:26:46.910]  tried to call in, 20 got on the line, and the sixth caller got it, so I'm very impressed
[02:26:46.910 --> 02:26:47.910]  right now.
[02:26:47.910 --> 02:26:48.910]  Terry, very impressed.
[02:26:48.910 --> 02:26:51.910]  Tell us about yourself and how you came up with the answer.
[02:26:52.269 --> 02:26:56.269]  Gee, I don't know.
[02:26:56.269 --> 02:26:57.269]  Just thought about it.
[02:26:57.269 --> 02:27:03.470]  I used to take your magazine that when you publish that, and I live right here by two
[02:27:03.470 --> 02:27:08.990]  military bases, one's Army and one's Air Force, and I take your magazines out and drop them
[02:27:08.990 --> 02:27:15.550]  off at the Army base, and then one day I took them out to the Air Force base, and the visitor
[02:27:15.550 --> 02:27:19.910]  center wasn't open where they check you in and give you a pass, so I shoved it through
[02:27:19.910 --> 02:27:26.949]  the doors, about five copies, and then went to leave, and behind me is two guys with fully
[02:27:26.949 --> 02:27:27.949]  automatic weapons.
[02:27:27.949 --> 02:27:33.070]  They want to know what the hell I'm doing, and so I told them, and they go, well, you
[02:27:33.070 --> 02:27:37.310]  can't be doing that, and I go, they said, you know, it's closed anyway, and they go,
[02:27:37.310 --> 02:27:41.510]  come back out another day, so I went back out another day, they were open, and I handed
[02:27:41.510 --> 02:27:47.189]  them out, and they liked it, and I tried to, went to leave, and one of the guys came out
[02:27:47.189 --> 02:27:51.789]  from the back room and said, sir, we need you to stay here, and then I ended up getting
[02:27:51.789 --> 02:27:58.869]  interrogated by some guys in suits, and they wanted to charge me with distribution of propaganda
[02:27:58.869 --> 02:27:59.869]  on a military base.
[02:27:59.869 --> 02:28:03.470]  Well, that just shows how many tyrants they've got.
[02:28:03.470 --> 02:28:04.869]  They were just trying to intimidate you.
[02:28:04.869 --> 02:28:07.869]  Let me guess, nothing happened.
[02:28:07.869 --> 02:28:11.869]  Well, they were setting up a court date, and I went back in and reminded them that the
[02:28:11.869 --> 02:28:15.990]  two guys that caught me on the Saturday when I was there said, come on back out another
[02:28:15.990 --> 02:28:17.590]  day, and they decided not to do nothing.
[02:28:17.590 --> 02:28:19.029]  Well, no, it's all intimidation.
[02:28:19.029 --> 02:28:24.269]  It's the First Amendment, so they're telling an American, you can't hand out a well-known
[02:28:24.269 --> 02:28:29.670]  pro-America person, it's just, it's so sick, but I want to hold you over, because you're
[02:28:29.670 --> 02:28:30.670]  the winner.
[02:28:30.670 --> 02:28:35.670]  Get his name, get his number, just get his address, and what T-shirt do you want?
[02:28:35.670 --> 02:28:40.189]  You want a Trump political president, or do you want an Alan Shultz for president shirt?
[02:28:40.189 --> 02:28:41.189]  Alex Jones for president.
[02:28:41.189 --> 02:28:42.189]  I wish he'd run.
[02:28:42.189 --> 02:28:45.949]  All right, well, we're going to get your address right now, and it's coming to you
[02:28:45.949 --> 02:28:50.910]  in the mail by Monday, so just don't hang up, I'm going to come back to you, because
[02:28:50.910 --> 02:28:51.910]  you nailed it.
[02:28:51.910 --> 02:28:58.070]  I'm going to explain this, this is really important when we come back, you nailed it.
[02:28:58.070 --> 02:29:00.630]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[02:29:00.630 --> 02:29:02.710]  Please write this down, and please go look this up.
[02:29:02.710 --> 02:29:04.750]  It will change your life.
[02:29:04.750 --> 02:29:09.230]  The UN admits, and the Lansing Medical Journal admits, that upwards of two billion people
[02:29:09.230 --> 02:29:13.470]  have mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities.
[02:29:13.470 --> 02:29:18.990]  The term they use is intellectual disability, because of lack of iodine.
[02:29:18.990 --> 02:29:24.710]  Most iodine in the environment is bound to other elements, so your body can't absorb it.
[02:29:24.710 --> 02:29:30.789]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells, and infowarestore.com has
[02:29:30.789 --> 02:29:36.070]  the only iodine out there that actually has this type of full effect.
[02:29:36.070 --> 02:29:40.550]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3's been sold out for six months, it's very hard to produce, and
[02:29:40.550 --> 02:29:42.109]  it's finally back in stock.
[02:29:42.510 --> 02:29:45.109]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[02:29:45.109 --> 02:29:49.710]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is powerful, you and your family need it, it's 25% off, back
[02:29:49.710 --> 02:29:55.109]  in stock, X3, triiodine, exclusively at infowarestore.com.
[02:29:55.109 --> 02:29:57.510]  Take action now, but regardless, research is info.
[02:29:57.510 --> 02:30:12.270]  You need to get coordinated with not only your food, but also your health supplements,
[02:30:12.270 --> 02:30:14.910]  because it's going to be a matter of life and death.
[02:30:14.910 --> 02:30:21.070]  So support infowarestore, listen, you need to put it as a priority, because you don't
[02:30:21.070 --> 02:30:25.630]  know, I don't know, Alex and I are telling you how late it is before midnight strikes,
[02:30:25.630 --> 02:30:31.230]  and again, magnesium is critical for your muscles and everything, krill oil.
[02:30:31.230 --> 02:30:37.390]  What I'm watching right before my eyes is a composite overview of nutritional supplements
[02:30:37.390 --> 02:30:41.990]  that will keep you alive, and I would urge everyone, maybe you don't take vitamins, maybe
[02:30:41.990 --> 02:30:46.470]  you don't take nutritional supplements, but the day will come, vitamin C and zinc, absolutely
[02:30:46.470 --> 02:30:51.750]  imperative for the cold, DNA force, absolutely imperative, mineral fusion, absolutely, as
[02:30:51.750 --> 02:30:55.150]  you're drinking filtered water, a lot of it will become demineralized.
[02:30:55.150 --> 02:30:57.390]  You have to have these products.
[02:30:57.390 --> 02:31:04.510]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had, I don't think anybody can deny it,
[02:31:04.510 --> 02:31:07.750]  and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[02:31:07.750 --> 02:31:13.750]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[02:31:13.750 --> 02:31:18.830]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight, and when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen
[02:31:18.830 --> 02:31:24.430]  Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really
[02:31:24.430 --> 02:31:25.430]  just incredible.
[02:31:25.430 --> 02:31:29.910]  So, for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support, and I want
[02:31:29.910 --> 02:31:34.550]  to encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support
[02:31:34.550 --> 02:31:35.550]  us.
[02:31:35.550 --> 02:31:38.670]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it,
[02:31:38.670 --> 02:31:43.550]  but most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great
[02:31:43.550 --> 02:31:47.430]  products that enrich and empower your life, all at the same time keep us on air.
[02:31:47.430 --> 02:31:51.830]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:31:51.830 --> 02:31:55.910]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsStore.com, our funding problems
[02:31:55.910 --> 02:31:56.910]  will be over.
[02:31:56.910 --> 02:31:57.910]  Please take action now.
[02:31:57.910 --> 02:32:02.230]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, is a historic
[02:32:02.230 --> 02:32:06.550]  book that documents the globalists, in their own words, plan for our future, that is the
[02:32:06.550 --> 02:32:07.550]  hellish future.
[02:32:07.550 --> 02:32:11.349]  Now, you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[02:32:11.349 --> 02:32:15.310]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores,
[02:32:15.310 --> 02:32:19.510]  Amazon, or InfoWarsStore.com, but you will never be able to get another signed copy of
[02:32:19.510 --> 02:32:24.270]  the book after the signed copies we got run out, and there's about 1,000 left of them
[02:32:24.270 --> 02:32:25.270]  right now.
[02:32:25.270 --> 02:32:30.869]  So, get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World, a signed copy, at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:32:30.869 --> 02:32:35.070]  There is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air, so you won't
[02:32:35.070 --> 02:32:39.349]  just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that you helped keep
[02:32:39.349 --> 02:32:40.349]  InfoWars on the air.
[02:32:40.349 --> 02:32:44.029]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book, or unsigned copies,
[02:32:44.029 --> 02:32:49.390]  but I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to InfoWarsStore.com and get a signed
[02:32:49.390 --> 02:32:53.590]  copy, and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate to the library, or give them to
[02:32:53.590 --> 02:32:54.590]  the local school.
[02:32:54.590 --> 02:32:58.710]  This is an InfoWar, I'm counting on you, and thank you for your support.
[02:32:58.710 --> 02:33:04.789]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:07.330 --> 02:33:13.330]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:13.330 --> 02:33:21.330]  I'm just an average man with an average life. I work from nine to five. Hell, I pay the price.
[02:33:21.330 --> 02:33:29.330]  All I want is to be left alone in my average home. But why do I always feel like I'm in the twilight zone?
[02:33:29.330 --> 02:33:36.330]  All I want is to be left alone in my average home. But why do I always feel like I'm in the twilight zone?
[02:33:36.330 --> 02:33:42.330]  All right, so Terry with the incredibly hard question I asked, I'm surprised actually a caller got it.
[02:33:42.330 --> 02:33:46.330]  I thought we'd take ten calls and I would answer the question. I was happy to send out a book and a t-shirt.
[02:33:46.330 --> 02:33:55.330]  I'm blown away that he got the answer because I only this morning saw it and months ago had told my wife and family,
[02:33:55.330 --> 02:34:01.330]  when you see this, this means they're about to make their next move. And I hadn't said it on air yet.
[02:34:01.330 --> 02:34:06.330]  Yes, the world's saying no to the shot. Yes, all these officials that pushed us are resigning.
[02:34:06.330 --> 02:34:12.330]  Yes, it's coming out that they had secret liability protection programs with Moderna and Pfizer.
[02:34:12.330 --> 02:34:21.330]  But when they end the emergency, it's so they can declare victory and claim all their lockdowns
[02:34:21.330 --> 02:34:33.330]  and all their controls saved us and that they defeated it. And so you can read the tea leaves maybe a month,
[02:34:33.330 --> 02:34:40.330]  six months, probably next year. Probably early next year, they start the new pandemic and the new virus.
[02:34:40.330 --> 02:34:45.330]  And they'll say, hey, we saved you from COVID with the lockdowns, the controls of the shots.
[02:34:45.330 --> 02:34:53.330]  We ended it together. We're victorious. The U.N. did it. That's why we've got the U.N. treaty.
[02:34:53.330 --> 02:35:00.330]  You need to ratify it and we'll protect you from this new thing.
[02:35:00.330 --> 02:35:06.330]  Whether it's mousepox or Marburg or a new strain of COVID.
[02:35:07.330 --> 02:35:16.330]  That they cooked up. So what a hard question. What an incredibly complex question of thousands of answers.
[02:35:16.330 --> 02:35:21.330]  And the other callers brought up issues that were corollary to it, that were that were part of it.
[02:35:21.330 --> 02:35:26.330]  But but but not the main issue. I am very impressed.
[02:35:26.330 --> 02:35:32.330]  So nothing against your sagas and what you've gone through to spread the truth, Terry, but those are side issues.
[02:35:32.330 --> 02:35:35.330]  We love you sitting there thinking about the question.
[02:35:35.330 --> 02:35:40.330]  How did you come up with the answer? Because what this means is they're preparing the next assault.
[02:35:40.330 --> 02:35:44.330]  They say the disease X is coming. They say the next pandemic is imminent.
[02:35:44.330 --> 02:35:48.330]  They already told us so we can telegraph how they're preparing. But this is what's happening.
[02:35:48.330 --> 02:35:55.330]  Make no mistake. And thinking about this, understanding it and you watch in six months, a year, you'll see it happen.
[02:35:55.330 --> 02:36:00.330]  You have no pressure. They may back off. Our only predictions that don't come true are the ones we stop.
[02:36:00.330 --> 02:36:04.330]  Believe me, I want to be disproven here. I want to stop it. So our predictions come true.
[02:36:04.330 --> 02:36:10.330]  But we'll be we'll be sitting here in six months, a year and it'll be, oh, my God, I did it again.
[02:36:10.330 --> 02:36:15.330]  I didn't do it again. I didn't do it again. I know the enemy's operation.
[02:36:15.330 --> 02:36:21.330]  They did it again. So go back, Terry, in Alaska.
[02:36:21.330 --> 02:36:27.330]  To the thought processes when you're listening to me, where you come with the exact answer, one of a million.
[02:36:27.330 --> 02:36:34.330]  How'd you do it? I just kind of put two and two together. I don't really know how to describe it.
[02:36:34.330 --> 02:36:39.330]  Yeah, well, they need to declare victory that they save us the last time they have to declare victory.
[02:36:39.330 --> 02:36:43.330]  They have to say they saved us so they can save us again. See how it works.
[02:36:43.330 --> 02:36:50.330]  Yep. When are you going to be getting some more vitamin mineral fusion?
[02:36:50.330 --> 02:36:53.330]  I wish it wasn't sold out. I wish we had the money to buy products.
[02:36:53.330 --> 02:36:56.330]  We barely have the money to buy what we've got, but we're we're barely in the black right now.
[02:36:56.330 --> 02:37:01.330]  And I think you're for support, brother. Anything else you'd like to add, Terry?
[02:37:01.330 --> 02:37:10.330]  Yeah, last year I sent an email to Rob Dues trying to get you guys to come up and go salmon fishing and get you to relax a little bit.
[02:37:10.330 --> 02:37:14.330]  But you're in the middle of I think he actually brought that up to me. I've never been to Alaska.
[02:37:14.330 --> 02:37:20.330]  I'm told it's spectacular. So you'd like it. When should I come?
[02:37:21.330 --> 02:37:25.330]  Well, if you want to go salmon fishing, do I.
[02:37:27.330 --> 02:37:30.330]  Guys, give me Terry's number. I was already thinking about going through in July.
[02:37:30.330 --> 02:37:40.330]  I was thinking about never been to Costa Rica, never been to Kosovo. They say that's incredible.
[02:37:40.330 --> 02:37:45.330]  Never been to Egypt, but Alaska was on the list. You know what? I'll come see you in Alaska.
[02:37:45.330 --> 02:37:52.330]  Someone hold get his number. Incredible. I'm going to Alaska now because I can answer that question.
[02:37:52.330 --> 02:37:57.330]  That is such a hard question to answer. I mean, that's very impressive. Six phone call.
[02:37:57.330 --> 02:38:03.330]  Fifth or sixth or sixth phone call. He nailed it. And let me tell you, that's what's happening.
[02:38:03.330 --> 02:38:06.330]  They are going to say we saved you last time. We're going to save you this time.
[02:38:06.330 --> 02:38:10.330]  They're reloading again, ladies and gentlemen. Very impressed, Terry.
[02:38:10.330 --> 02:38:13.330]  All right, Buzz, you now want to get into the indictment of Trump because the quiz is over.
[02:38:13.330 --> 02:38:18.330]  Buzz, go ahead. Pennsylvania. Alex Jones. God, break me down right now.
[02:38:18.330 --> 02:38:22.330]  I swear to God, I had the exact answer that your previous caller just answered.
[02:38:22.330 --> 02:38:26.330]  Congratulations. That shows how smart the audience is. So give us your take on that.
[02:38:26.330 --> 02:38:29.330]  Well, yeah, I just want to add a few extra points to it.
[02:38:29.330 --> 02:38:34.330]  It's all it is the fact that they're going to be there preparing, ramping up the next thing.
[02:38:34.330 --> 02:38:42.330]  But it's bigger than that. I think it's setting the precedent that they say when a pandemic ends and when it starts.
[02:38:42.330 --> 02:38:47.330]  And it's also there's evidence because it's about their power. Exactly. They control it.
[02:38:47.330 --> 02:38:51.330]  Hey, you get a T-shirt and a book to get his name and number. Sorry.
[02:38:51.330 --> 02:38:55.330]  No, I believe you. I believe you. I believe you have the answer. So you're going to get the prize, too.
[02:38:55.330 --> 02:38:58.330]  Go ahead. Thanks, brother. I appreciate that.
[02:38:58.330 --> 02:39:02.330]  But no, I want to say because the W.H.O. changed.
[02:39:02.330 --> 02:39:09.330]  No, the U.S. Senate gave complete control to the W.H.O. by signing over the treat pandemic treaty right
[02:39:09.330 --> 02:39:17.330]  and changing the name from a treaty to an accord, thereby advocating our responsibility to declare when pandemics start.
[02:39:17.330 --> 02:39:21.330]  Exactly. They're testing their power to say when one starts and when.
[02:39:21.330 --> 02:39:24.330]  And that's the sub answer. The main answer is they're getting ready for a new one.
[02:39:24.330 --> 02:39:27.330]  They want to declare victory that they beat the last thing to pose as savers.
[02:39:27.330 --> 02:39:32.330]  But the second corollary issue is they want to declare when a pandemic happens to be in control of it.
[02:39:33.330 --> 02:39:39.330]  Yeah, but here's a quote that I found on an article from this one doctor who was represented by the W.H.O.
[02:39:39.330 --> 02:39:46.330]  He said the danger of keeping keeping it forever, meaning the pandemic, is diluting the tool.
[02:39:46.330 --> 02:39:52.330]  You need it to retain its force. So basically, they were moving the tool to keep the power there.
[02:39:52.330 --> 02:39:55.330]  Essentially. Exactly. It's a cycle. They got a cycle on cycle off.
[02:39:55.330 --> 02:39:59.330]  Exactly. Which signals the end of this and they're reloading for the next attack.
[02:40:00.330 --> 02:40:03.330]  Absolutely. That's it. I'm very impressed.
[02:40:03.330 --> 02:40:09.330]  I'm going to put you on hold. I'm going to put you on hold and get a signed copy of the book and a T-shirt of your choice.
[02:40:09.330 --> 02:40:12.330]  Do you want a Trump political president or an Alex Jones for president?
[02:40:15.330 --> 02:40:18.330]  We only got two T-shirts right now. We do limited editions now. That's it.
[02:40:18.330 --> 02:40:22.330]  Trump political president shirt with a mugshot or Alex Jones for president?
[02:40:23.330 --> 02:40:25.330]  Two Alex Jones for president.
[02:40:25.330 --> 02:40:29.330]  All right. Put him on hold. Make sure customers. Go ahead.
[02:40:29.330 --> 02:40:31.330]  That two should be president.
[02:40:31.330 --> 02:40:36.330]  Yeah. Well, it's a fun shirt for thought provoking stuff. I'm really impressed right now.
[02:40:36.330 --> 02:40:39.330]  Thank you, Buzz. Make sure he gets it, OK? We're going to start this new thing.
[02:40:39.330 --> 02:40:43.330]  I did it years ago. We're going to do it again. Let's go to Matt in Minnesota.
[02:40:43.330 --> 02:40:45.330]  Matt, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:40:45.330 --> 02:40:49.330]  Hey, thanks, Alex. Just to piggyback off what everyone else was saying,
[02:40:50.330 --> 02:40:55.330]  I think a lot of us share the same thought process. I definitely was on board with what they're saying.
[02:40:55.330 --> 02:41:00.330]  But it's to show that the World Health Organization and the U.N. control our government.
[02:41:00.330 --> 02:41:04.330]  You know what they say it's over. All the other governments fall in line and say.
[02:41:04.330 --> 02:41:07.330]  That's right. You're right. You're right. I think it's a dual answer.
[02:41:07.330 --> 02:41:11.330]  It signifies they want to be the savior saying we beat the last one, but we're in charge of it.
[02:41:11.330 --> 02:41:17.330]  Yeah. Yep. So that way they know, hey, we do have all the control over these governments because we said it and they're doing it.
[02:41:17.330 --> 02:41:21.330]  So we have all the right controls in place. Yeah.
[02:41:21.330 --> 02:41:24.330]  Yeah, I think that's a dual. I think that's a dual accurate answer.
[02:41:24.330 --> 02:41:26.330]  So you get a free book and a T-shirt, too.
[02:41:26.330 --> 02:41:29.330]  You know, I got to be honest with you. I already have the book.
[02:41:29.330 --> 02:41:32.330]  You know, I went out and got a signed copy as soon as they were available.
[02:41:32.330 --> 02:41:35.330]  So what what do you want? Because you didn't answer it.
[02:41:35.330 --> 02:41:39.330]  Oh, you want a bottle? How about a bottle X3?
[02:41:39.330 --> 02:41:42.330]  I think you surprised me. You know, I have iodine.
[02:41:42.330 --> 02:41:46.330]  I usually do vitamin mineral, you know, but whatever you want to turboforce.
[02:41:46.330 --> 02:41:48.330]  Sure. That sounds great.
[02:41:48.330 --> 02:41:51.330]  Put him on hold, get his name and number, his address, give him a turboforce.
[02:41:51.330 --> 02:41:54.330]  We got a minute to break. What else do you want to say, smart guy?
[02:41:54.330 --> 02:41:56.330]  You know, just thank you for everything you do.
[02:41:56.330 --> 02:42:01.330]  And is it OK if I plug somebody else that you guys carry on video?
[02:42:01.330 --> 02:42:04.330]  You know, I love your show. I love on Troyer.
[02:42:04.330 --> 02:42:07.330]  I love all the shows. I love that's why we love it.
[02:42:07.330 --> 02:42:12.330]  But if you need a little bit extra macro aggressions, Charlie Robinson is fantastic.
[02:42:12.330 --> 02:42:16.330]  And it's just an hour, you know, I think it is to one hour episodes a week.
[02:42:16.330 --> 02:42:20.330]  So, you know, a good little supplement when you need a little bit extra to listen to
[02:42:20.330 --> 02:42:23.330]  and you've listened to all the other InfoWars shows.
[02:42:23.330 --> 02:42:26.330]  He's really great. I will check it out, Matt.
[02:42:26.330 --> 02:42:32.330]  All right. Get Matt's address bottle or canister of turboforce for him.
[02:42:32.330 --> 02:42:35.330]  Very impressed. I always pronounce names wrong.
[02:42:35.330 --> 02:42:38.330]  I can barely speak English.
[02:42:38.330 --> 02:42:42.330]  Yusumbo. Is that right?
[02:42:44.330 --> 02:42:47.330]  Yusabio. Yusabio in Tennessee.
[02:42:47.330 --> 02:42:52.330]  Coming right back to you and then Michael and Derek and Cindy.
[02:42:52.330 --> 02:42:56.330]  And then the next big guest host takes over, Jay Dyer.
[02:42:58.330 --> 02:43:00.330]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth.
[02:43:00.330 --> 02:43:04.330]  The solution is laying right there in front of you, hidden in plain view.
[02:43:04.330 --> 02:43:07.330]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[02:43:07.330 --> 02:43:10.330]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website
[02:43:10.330 --> 02:43:16.330]  where they admit the number one cause of cognitive disability in the world is iodine deficiency.
[02:43:16.330 --> 02:43:24.330]  The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability is lack of real, pure iodine in the body
[02:43:24.330 --> 02:43:30.330]  as they bomb us with the bad halogens, bromine, bromide, chlorine and so much more.
[02:43:30.330 --> 02:43:35.330]  Upwards of 2 billion people in a Lancet Medical Journal study in 2007
[02:43:35.330 --> 02:43:40.330]  worldwide have cognitive disabilities because they don't have high quality iodine.
[02:43:40.330 --> 02:43:42.330]  Most iodine is bound to other elements. You don't absorb it.
[02:43:42.330 --> 02:43:48.330]  We have X3, all three types of good iodine together that supercharges your body.
[02:43:48.330 --> 02:43:51.330]  X3 is now back in stock at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:43:51.330 --> 02:43:54.330]  It's been sold out for over six months for 25% off.

[02:43:58.330 --> 02:44:02.330]  Infowars. Tomorrow's news. Today.
[02:44:02.330 --> 02:44:04.330]  This is their big move.
[02:44:04.330 --> 02:44:07.330]  So yeah, you say, why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States?
[02:44:07.330 --> 02:44:10.330]  He doesn't care. That's not his job.
[02:44:10.330 --> 02:44:12.330]  He's not the president of the United States.
[02:44:12.330 --> 02:44:15.330]  He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[02:44:15.330 --> 02:44:20.330]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased.
[02:44:20.330 --> 02:44:22.330]  They must be opposed.
[02:44:22.330 --> 02:44:25.330]  Autocrats only understand one word.
[02:44:25.330 --> 02:44:28.330]  No, no, no.
[02:44:28.330 --> 02:44:32.330]  Exactly. And that's why we say no to your vaccines.
[02:44:33.330 --> 02:44:36.330]  We say no to you shutting down our businesses.
[02:44:36.330 --> 02:44:38.330]  We say no to you taking our firearms.
[02:44:38.330 --> 02:44:41.330]  We say no to you censoring our free speech.
[02:44:41.330 --> 02:44:44.330]  We say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization.
[02:44:44.330 --> 02:44:47.330]  We say no to you getting us into World War Three.
[02:44:47.330 --> 02:44:50.330]  You're right. We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden.
[02:44:50.330 --> 02:44:54.330]  And we say no. And we say no to your war.
[02:44:54.330 --> 02:45:04.330]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into the atmosphere.
[02:45:04.330 --> 02:45:07.330]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[02:45:07.330 --> 02:45:15.330]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers to convert these gases into fluorosilicic acid.
[02:45:15.330 --> 02:45:18.330]  Still highly toxic, but containable.
[02:45:18.330 --> 02:45:21.330]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison.
[02:45:21.330 --> 02:45:24.330]  And there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[02:45:24.330 --> 02:45:29.330]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the Secretary of the Treasury,
[02:45:29.330 --> 02:45:32.330]  who was responsible for the public health service at the time.
[02:45:32.330 --> 02:45:41.330]  And by 1950, the U.S. government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste product and dumping it into our drinking water.
[02:45:41.330 --> 02:45:46.330]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[02:45:46.330 --> 02:45:50.330]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water.
[02:45:50.330 --> 02:45:56.330]  And a remedy to this madness. Available now at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:45:56.330 --> 02:46:00.330]  TurboForce is back. Sold out for eight months.
[02:46:00.330 --> 02:46:04.330]  And it's TurboForce Plus. We made it even stronger.
[02:46:04.330 --> 02:46:08.330]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[02:46:08.330 --> 02:46:15.330]  TurboForce is back in stock at Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:46:15.330 --> 02:46:21.330]  And it's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[02:46:21.330 --> 02:46:23.330]  Should be called 10-hour energy.
[02:46:23.330 --> 02:46:27.330]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things.
[02:46:27.330 --> 02:46:34.330]  And amino acids that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[02:46:34.330 --> 02:46:38.330]  It is the super fuel.
[02:46:38.330 --> 02:46:41.330]  RainForce Plus is great. RainForce Ultra is great.
[02:46:41.330 --> 02:46:43.330]  They're two different nootropics. They go good with this.
[02:46:43.330 --> 02:46:47.330]  This is the King Kong. This is the boss.
[02:46:47.330 --> 02:46:51.330]  TurboForce. Back in stock. Discounted. Infowarsstore.com.
[02:46:51.330 --> 02:46:54.330]  More power. More strength. More energy.
[02:46:58.330 --> 02:47:02.330]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:47:02.330 --> 02:47:04.330]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:47:06.200 --> 02:47:29.200]  They told him, don't you ever come around here Don't wanna see your face, you better disappear
[02:47:29.200 --> 02:47:36.200]  The fires in their eyes and their words are really clear So beat it, just beat it
[02:47:36.200 --> 02:47:43.200]  You better run, you better do what you can Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man
[02:47:43.200 --> 02:47:50.200]  You wanna be tough, better do what you can So beat it, but you wanna be fair
[02:47:50.200 --> 02:47:57.200]  Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it No one wants to beat it, beat it
[02:47:57.200 --> 02:48:04.200]  Sure, I'm a funky, strong, sharp fighter It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
[02:48:04.200 --> 02:48:11.200]  Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
[02:48:11.200 --> 02:48:17.200]  Their eyes are dead, you better leave while you can You wanna be a boy, you wanna be a man
[02:48:17.200 --> 02:48:24.200]  You wanna stay alive, better do what you can So beat it, just beat it
[02:48:24.200 --> 02:48:31.200]  You have to show them that you're really not scared You're playing with your life, this ain't no truth or dare
[02:48:31.200 --> 02:48:38.200]  They'll kick you if they beat you, they'll tell you it's fair So beat it, but you wanna be fair
[02:48:38.200 --> 02:48:45.200]  Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it No one wants to beat it, beat it
[02:48:45.200 --> 02:48:52.200]  Sure, I'm a funky, strong, sharp fighter It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
[02:48:52.200 --> 02:48:59.200]  Just beat it, beat it, beat it No one wants to beat it, beat it
[02:49:08.200 --> 02:49:10.200]  Just look for that at InfoWars.com
[02:49:10.200 --> 02:49:14.200]  I'm gonna go back to the callers, but I'm not buttering up the listeners
[02:49:14.200 --> 02:49:17.200]  I didn't think when we took like 10, 15 calls, one person would get the answer
[02:49:17.200 --> 02:49:19.200]  Much less in the first few calls
[02:49:19.200 --> 02:49:21.200]  Very, very amazing
[02:49:21.200 --> 02:49:25.200]  But I said it's my opinion, this is why they're doing it
[02:49:25.200 --> 02:49:28.200]  Which is a big part of it, so there's a lot of other reasons in their calculus they did it
[02:49:28.200 --> 02:49:32.200]  And then three callers, including the guy that got it, the next two said
[02:49:32.200 --> 02:49:36.200]  Very eloquently, but it's really about them being in charge at the UN
[02:49:36.200 --> 02:49:38.200]  And saying when a pandemic begins and when it ends
[02:49:38.200 --> 02:49:41.200]  And I really thought, wow, that's just as important
[02:49:41.200 --> 02:49:43.200]  That's the main two reasons, that's why I gave them prizes
[02:49:43.200 --> 02:49:47.200]  Because they taught me, that's why I took the calls
[02:49:47.200 --> 02:49:49.200]  I didn't think of that
[02:49:49.200 --> 02:49:51.200]  And that's the synergy of humanity
[02:49:51.200 --> 02:49:54.200]  I was seeing, and telling the family, when they declare an end to it
[02:49:54.200 --> 02:49:56.200]  They wanna say they're the saviors, that means the next one's coming
[02:49:56.200 --> 02:50:03.200]  But it's also about them being in charge of when they say what happens when one ends
[02:50:03.200 --> 02:50:05.200]  That's why we take the calls
[02:50:05.200 --> 02:50:08.200]  That's impressive, incredible
[02:50:09.200 --> 02:50:11.200]  I mean, average talk radio is smarter than the general public
[02:50:11.200 --> 02:50:14.200]  But my god, that was incredible
[02:50:14.200 --> 02:50:17.200]  I mean, I am just in awe of this audience
[02:50:18.200 --> 02:50:21.200]  Alright, how do I pronounce the person from Tennessee? You know I'm stupid
[02:50:24.200 --> 02:50:27.200]  Usablo, am I saying that right? I'm sorry, from Tennessee, go ahead
[02:50:27.200 --> 02:50:33.200]  Yeah, just to let you know, basically my name was after the guy who influenced
[02:50:33.200 --> 02:50:38.200]  The emperor Constantine back in ancient Rome to convert to Christianity
[02:50:38.200 --> 02:50:42.200]  That guy's name was Eusebius of Caesarea
[02:50:42.200 --> 02:50:44.200]  So, they named me after that guy
[02:50:44.200 --> 02:50:49.200]  Alright, so, first of all, I just wanna say it's an honor and a privilege to speak with you, Alex
[02:50:49.200 --> 02:50:53.200]  And I wanna say you woke me up in 2010
[02:50:53.200 --> 02:50:59.200]  When I saw your documentary with Joel Skousen, Strategic Relocation
[02:50:59.200 --> 02:51:07.200]  It so blew me away that I had to look up every last word that both of you guys uttered in that documentary
[02:51:07.200 --> 02:51:12.200]  And it just sent me on a trip that's not ended today
[02:51:12.200 --> 02:51:16.200]  It's scary how smart Joel Skousen is, like every damn thing he says is true
[02:51:16.200 --> 02:51:20.200]  And you're like, the guy's a brainiac
[02:51:20.200 --> 02:51:22.200]  Yeah, absolutely my book
[02:51:22.200 --> 02:51:26.200]  So, by the way, I happen to be a board certified psychiatrist with 32 years experience
[02:51:26.200 --> 02:51:28.200]  I hope you don't hold that against me
[02:51:28.200 --> 02:51:31.200]  You said 30 years experience at what?
[02:51:31.200 --> 02:51:34.200]  Yeah, as a board certified psychiatrist
[02:51:34.200 --> 02:51:36.200]  No, that's okay, brother
[02:51:36.200 --> 02:51:38.200]  We got good psychiatrists and we got bad ones
[02:51:38.200 --> 02:51:40.200]  We got good cops, we got bad ones, go ahead
[02:51:40.200 --> 02:51:44.200]  I actually listen to all the stuff you say about mental health issues and whatnot
[02:51:44.200 --> 02:51:46.200]  I want you to know you're totally spot on
[02:51:46.200 --> 02:51:48.200]  What are you seeing with marijuana, man?
[02:51:48.200 --> 02:51:50.200]  So many friends of mine have gone crazy
[02:51:50.200 --> 02:51:52.200]  It's so strong now
[02:51:52.200 --> 02:51:55.200]  Well, you've actually commented on this many times
[02:51:55.200 --> 02:52:00.200]  Which is that all bets are off when anybody uses anything from the street
[02:52:00.200 --> 02:52:02.200]  You can throw anything in there
[02:52:02.200 --> 02:52:05.200]  Rat poison, you name it
[02:52:05.200 --> 02:52:09.200]  I tell people all the time, stay away from anything that comes through the street like that
[02:52:09.200 --> 02:52:14.200]  Hell, even prescription medications, amphetamines and the like
[02:52:14.200 --> 02:52:17.200]  They will throw you straight into the hospital with an acute psychotic break
[02:52:17.200 --> 02:52:23.200]  Listen, Alex, I wanted to tag, if I may, onto what the other folks said
[02:52:23.200 --> 02:52:27.200]  Because this is such an important topic
[02:52:27.200 --> 02:52:31.200]  I just wanted to throw my two cents in there for whatever it's worth
[02:52:31.200 --> 02:52:32.200]  Can you still hear me okay?
[02:52:32.200 --> 02:52:34.200]  I can, go ahead
[02:52:34.200 --> 02:52:35.200]  Alright, great
[02:52:35.200 --> 02:52:38.200]  So regarding that question, you know, the reasons for ending the pandemic
[02:52:38.200 --> 02:52:41.200]  I'm just going to give you a quick word
[02:52:41.200 --> 02:52:43.200]  So the first reason is, first of all
[02:52:43.200 --> 02:52:48.200]  And by the way, everything I'm about to say is overwhelmingly stuff you've already said
[02:52:48.200 --> 02:52:50.200]  Alright, so here goes
[02:52:50.200 --> 02:52:53.200]  I'm going to kind of channel Alex Jones right now
[02:52:53.200 --> 02:52:57.200]  So the first one is, COVID was only the beta test
[02:52:57.200 --> 02:52:59.200]  They already accomplished their main goal
[02:52:59.200 --> 02:53:01.200]  They didn't accomplish everything they wanted there
[02:53:01.200 --> 02:53:03.200]  But they accomplished the main goal
[02:53:03.200 --> 02:53:06.200]  Secondarily, very closely related to that
[02:53:06.200 --> 02:53:08.200]  They did the damage
[02:53:08.200 --> 02:53:10.200]  It's a slow train wreck
[02:53:10.200 --> 02:53:13.200]  You know, it's a soft kill, like you said
[02:53:13.200 --> 02:53:15.200]  It's already bringing down the economy
[02:53:15.200 --> 02:53:16.200]  Correct
[02:53:16.200 --> 02:53:18.200]  So I'm not going to expound on that
[02:53:18.200 --> 02:53:20.200]  You've already elaborated on that
[02:53:20.200 --> 02:53:22.200]  Tremendously, many times
[02:53:22.200 --> 02:53:24.200]  So the damage is already done
[02:53:24.200 --> 02:53:25.200]  And it's going to continue to go
[02:53:25.200 --> 02:53:27.200]  So they don't need to keep this thing going
[02:53:27.200 --> 02:53:31.200]  Thirdly, they know that the public
[02:53:31.200 --> 02:53:34.200]  Has reached some sort of critical mass the world over
[02:53:34.200 --> 02:53:40.200]  And since the masses are onto the shots
[02:53:40.200 --> 02:53:42.200]  Compliance is plummeting
[02:53:42.200 --> 02:53:44.200]  Then related to that
[02:53:44.200 --> 02:53:46.200]  They're backing off
[02:53:46.200 --> 02:53:48.200]  Because if they don't
[02:53:48.200 --> 02:53:50.200]  They're concerned that the masses are going to
[02:53:50.200 --> 02:53:53.200]  Basically cross some sort of threshold
[02:53:53.200 --> 02:53:54.200]  And they're going to do
[02:53:54.200 --> 02:53:56.200]  Like what's going on in France right now
[02:53:56.200 --> 02:53:59.200]  They're going to overthrow the control structure
[02:53:59.200 --> 02:54:00.200]  And they can't have that
[02:54:00.200 --> 02:54:01.200]  They push as far as they can
[02:54:01.200 --> 02:54:03.200]  And then back off and prepare the new attack
[02:54:03.200 --> 02:54:05.200]  Great points, God bless you
[02:54:05.200 --> 02:54:07.200]  Alright, let's talk to Derek in Kentucky
[02:54:07.200 --> 02:54:08.200]  And then Cindy in Delaware
[02:54:08.200 --> 02:54:10.200]  Go ahead, Derek
[02:54:10.200 --> 02:54:12.200]  Alex, it's an honor to be here
[02:54:12.200 --> 02:54:15.200]  I've been listening to you since 2006
[02:54:16.200 --> 02:54:18.200]  I'm a health freedom advocate
[02:54:18.200 --> 02:54:19.200]  So you really drew me in
[02:54:19.200 --> 02:54:21.200]  You're one of the most prominent voices
[02:54:21.200 --> 02:54:23.200]  Talking about Big Pharma
[02:54:23.200 --> 02:54:25.200]  And how they were basically taking over
[02:54:25.200 --> 02:54:27.200]  Every aspect of our lives
[02:54:27.200 --> 02:54:29.200]  And as far as the big question
[02:54:29.200 --> 02:54:32.200]  I think y'all had a pretty good outlay of it
[02:54:32.200 --> 02:54:35.200]  I believe that it is mission accomplished
[02:54:35.200 --> 02:54:36.200]  It's their mission accomplished moment
[02:54:36.200 --> 02:54:38.200]  Where they can just declare victory
[02:54:38.200 --> 02:54:40.200]  While playing damage control
[02:54:40.200 --> 02:54:42.200]  And then they've already used the Trojan horse
[02:54:42.200 --> 02:54:43.200]  Why do they need it anymore?
[02:54:43.200 --> 02:54:44.200]  They've already gotten through
[02:54:44.200 --> 02:54:47.200]  They've already established their systems of control
[02:54:47.200 --> 02:54:50.200]  They've done as much as they can do with that tool
[02:54:50.200 --> 02:54:51.200]  For now
[02:54:51.200 --> 02:54:53.200]  So they're going to put it on the back burner
[02:54:53.200 --> 02:54:55.200]  They're still maintaining all the emergency powers
[02:54:55.200 --> 02:54:56.200]  That's still in their pocket
[02:54:56.200 --> 02:54:58.200]  To bring out anytime in the future
[02:54:58.200 --> 02:55:00.200]  And so we've got to be vigilant
[02:55:00.200 --> 02:55:03.200]  And we've got to be aware when it happens again
[02:55:03.200 --> 02:55:04.200]  But in the meantime
[02:55:04.200 --> 02:55:07.200]  They're just going to pivot to the banking crisis
[02:55:07.200 --> 02:55:08.200]  The immigration crisis
[02:55:08.200 --> 02:55:11.200]  The next new cyber attack that might happen
[02:55:11.200 --> 02:55:12.200]  That's right
[02:55:12.200 --> 02:55:14.200]  They push their agenda as far as it works
[02:55:14.200 --> 02:55:16.200]  Then they back off and move with something new
[02:55:16.200 --> 02:55:19.200]  I'm calling on a very important matter
[02:55:19.200 --> 02:55:22.200]  I'm facing trial in the state of Kentucky
[02:55:22.200 --> 02:55:24.200]  I presented myself as a whistleblower
[02:55:24.200 --> 02:55:25.200]  In the very beginning of this
[02:55:25.200 --> 02:55:27.200]  To the police department
[02:55:27.200 --> 02:55:29.200]  I wanted a criminal investigation
[02:55:29.200 --> 02:55:32.200]  I believe that a crime has been committed against us
[02:55:32.200 --> 02:55:34.200]  Our constitutional rights have been violated
[02:55:34.200 --> 02:55:36.200]  And so they came after you for that?
[02:55:36.200 --> 02:55:39.200]  No, they wouldn't listen to me
[02:55:39.200 --> 02:55:41.200]  The police departments were closed
[02:55:41.200 --> 02:55:43.200]  The courts were closed during COVID
[02:55:43.200 --> 02:55:45.200]  Under the state of emergency
[02:55:45.200 --> 02:55:47.200]  So basically our constitutional rights were suspended
[02:55:47.200 --> 02:55:49.200]  And they did that to have the crime explode?
[02:55:49.200 --> 02:55:54.200]  Yeah, and the rates of crime exploded in my community
[02:55:54.200 --> 02:55:57.200]  And you can't even get a police officer
[02:55:57.200 --> 02:55:59.200]  To come out for a report on burglary
[02:55:59.200 --> 02:56:03.200]  And they have trials that are backed up two years
[02:56:03.200 --> 02:56:05.200]  For all sorts of issues
[02:56:05.200 --> 02:56:07.200]  Because they closed our courts down
[02:56:07.200 --> 02:56:09.200]  And so I was trying to petition
[02:56:09.200 --> 02:56:10.200]  For redress of grievance
[02:56:10.200 --> 02:56:12.200]  Which is our constitutional right
[02:56:12.200 --> 02:56:14.200]  But there is no way
[02:56:14.200 --> 02:56:15.200]  The big part of that is
[02:56:15.200 --> 02:56:16.200]  By having the police stand down
[02:56:16.200 --> 02:56:18.200]  The prosecutors are almost all Soros
[02:56:18.200 --> 02:56:20.200]  Then they can commit all those resources
[02:56:20.200 --> 02:56:22.200]  To go after the American people
[02:56:22.200 --> 02:56:23.200]  And they did
[02:56:23.200 --> 02:56:25.200]  They came after me big time
[02:56:25.200 --> 02:56:28.200]  I was posting letters of public indictment
[02:56:28.200 --> 02:56:31.200]  Taped to the sides of the media operations
[02:56:31.200 --> 02:56:32.200]  And the police department
[02:56:32.200 --> 02:56:34.200]  So what are you facing trial for?
[02:56:34.200 --> 02:56:36.200]  Tell us your name, what's happening?
[02:56:36.200 --> 02:56:37.200]  My name is Derek Nance
[02:56:37.200 --> 02:56:39.200]  And I'm facing trial for criminal mischief
[02:56:39.200 --> 02:56:41.200]  Because in order to get attention
[02:56:41.200 --> 02:56:43.200]  To the Protestant Reformation
[02:56:43.200 --> 02:56:45.200]  You nail the protestation
[02:56:45.200 --> 02:56:47.200]  To the doors of the establishment
[02:56:47.200 --> 02:56:49.200]  It's the most ancient form of protest
[02:56:49.200 --> 02:56:50.200]  Sure, so what happened? What did they do?
[02:56:50.200 --> 02:56:52.200]  And they basically sent
[02:56:52.200 --> 02:56:54.200]  The Department of Homeland Security after me
[02:56:54.200 --> 02:56:56.200]  They did forensic analysis
[02:56:56.200 --> 02:56:57.200]  On the Christmas cards
[02:56:57.200 --> 02:56:59.200]  That I was sending to detectives
[02:56:59.200 --> 02:57:00.200]  I was playing Richard Kimball
[02:57:00.200 --> 02:57:02.200]  Leaving evidence at the crime scene
[02:57:02.200 --> 02:57:03.200]  Sure, just like they sent Homeland Security
[02:57:03.200 --> 02:57:04.200]  After the parents protesting
[02:57:04.200 --> 02:57:06.200]  Critical race theory at the school boards
[02:57:06.200 --> 02:57:07.200]  Right, it's outrageous
[02:57:07.200 --> 02:57:09.200]  They spent that much resources
[02:57:09.200 --> 02:57:10.200]  To track down a man
[02:57:10.200 --> 02:57:12.200]  For posting letters of indictment
[02:57:12.200 --> 02:57:13.200]  Because they weren't helping
[02:57:13.200 --> 02:57:14.200]  Old ladies getting raped and robbed
[02:57:14.200 --> 02:57:15.200]  Brother, send me a letter
[02:57:15.200 --> 02:57:17.200]  Let me know, I want to cover your story
[02:57:17.200 --> 02:57:19.200]  Alright, final segment
[02:57:19.200 --> 02:57:20.200]  First segment of the next hour
[02:57:20.200 --> 02:57:21.200]  Cindy, you're up
[02:57:21.200 --> 02:57:24.200]  And then J. Dyer is an incredible researcher
[02:57:24.200 --> 02:57:26.200]  Everybody needs to stay tuned
[02:57:26.200 --> 02:57:27.200]  Watch it and share it
[02:57:27.200 --> 02:57:28.200]  This whole show will be posted
[02:57:28.200 --> 02:57:29.200]  To be in a video tomorrow
[02:57:29.200 --> 02:57:30.200]  I'll be here at the office
[02:57:30.200 --> 02:57:32.200]  I haven't decided if I'm going to go live
[02:57:32.200 --> 02:57:33.200]  Or take a special show
[02:57:33.200 --> 02:57:34.200]  I'm doing some interviews
[02:57:34.200 --> 02:57:35.200]  But I'll be up here
[02:57:35.200 --> 02:57:37.200]  Beavering away against the enemy
[02:57:37.200 --> 02:57:39.200]  And then Sunday, if I'm not dead
[02:57:39.200 --> 02:57:41.200]  4 p.m. Central with a Sunday show
[02:57:41.200 --> 02:57:42.200]  Hour number 4
[02:57:42.200 --> 02:57:43.200]  Straight ahead
[02:57:43.200 --> 02:57:44.200]  Stay with us
[02:57:45.100 --> 02:57:47.100]  You
[02:57:47.540 --> 02:57:52.500]  Please give me one minute of your time. Please write this down and please go look this up
[02:57:52.500 --> 02:57:59.940]  It will change your life the UN admits and the Lanzik Medical Journal admits that upwards of 2 billion people have mental
[02:58:00.420 --> 02:58:04.340]  disabilities and declining cognitive abilities the term they use is
[02:58:04.820 --> 02:58:10.460]  intellectual disability because of lack of iodine most iodine in the environment is
[02:58:10.900 --> 02:58:13.900]  Bound to other elements so your body can't absorb it
[02:58:14.300 --> 02:58:18.660]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells and
[02:58:19.020 --> 02:58:25.660]  Infowarsstore.com has the only iodine out there that actually has this type of full effect

[02:58:48.860 --> 02:58:55.380]  I warned the world that the globalists were gonna move against Tucker Carlson to take him off the air people said no ways the most
[02:58:55.380 --> 02:58:58.420]  Pop would ever happen. They've got quadrillions of stolen money
[02:58:58.420 --> 02:59:01.260]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believe they can control him
[02:59:01.260 --> 02:59:04.220]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't he was taken off the air
[02:59:04.220 --> 02:59:10.100]  It's the same thing with Infowars, but Infowars is not owned by Fox or controlled by George Soros

[02:59:49.300 --> 02:59:55.100]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones
[03:00:00.860 --> 03:00:06.400]  Final segment before Jay Dyer takes over. We'll play a short clip next segment. We're in
[03:00:07.400 --> 03:00:14.280]  2002 I predicted everything that's currently happening when they take the country down the lockdowns the attack on the dollar the wars
[03:00:14.480 --> 03:00:20.400]  The forced injections, how did I know I've said the enemy that's kind of a start of the next segment about six minutes from now
[03:00:20.760 --> 03:00:26.240]  But right now, let's go to Cindy in Delaware Cindy. You're our tail gunner. Thank you for calling. Thanks for holding her on the air
[03:00:26.640 --> 03:00:29.680]  Hey, um, you know what? I think going on
[03:00:29.680 --> 03:00:35.840]  I think this we know that they plan all these pandemics and everything they do way ahead of time
[03:00:35.960 --> 03:00:40.480]  Okay, one of the things they're trying to do is they're trying to make all
[03:00:41.840 --> 03:00:48.440]  Medicine all medical care from the top down. They want to be the ones to tell you what you're going to take what you're
[03:00:49.720 --> 03:00:53.000]  Therapeutics, that's right. Yeah, it's the World Health Organization
[03:00:54.200 --> 03:01:01.120]  Really cared about people. Why are there so many poisons allowed in our food here in the United States?
[03:01:01.680 --> 03:01:07.400]  Once it aren't allowed another country, right? They don't care about that. But I think just like this
[03:01:07.920 --> 03:01:12.280]  Eagle report, I think they try and pick and choose. They're farming us. All right
[03:01:12.800 --> 03:01:15.560]  They are farming us. They're trying to decide
[03:01:16.160 --> 03:01:24.080]  What countries are going to prosper where the sickness is going to be who's going to survive and this next pandemic?
[03:01:24.240 --> 03:01:26.280]  They're going to have the cure
[03:01:26.760 --> 03:01:31.400]  They're going to tell people they have the cure just like the jab was supposed to be the cure and
[03:01:32.720 --> 03:01:34.360]  People are going to fall for it
[03:01:34.360 --> 03:01:37.760]  Sounds like it's going to be Marburg or some deadly flail or something
[03:01:37.880 --> 03:01:41.520]  But the main thing people can do now is get
[03:01:42.480 --> 03:01:44.480]  ivermectin and a C
[03:01:45.440 --> 03:01:51.440]  Lots of vitamin C. Thank the whole thing. We've seen what happened with their run through
[03:01:52.840 --> 03:01:54.840]  Now we have to be prepared for that
[03:01:57.200 --> 03:01:58.120]  A
[03:01:58.120 --> 03:02:05.160]  Lockdown, they're going to have major lockdown. The other thing is make sure you have plenty of food a way to purify your water
[03:02:07.040 --> 03:02:08.520]  It
[03:02:08.520 --> 03:02:10.520]  it's on I
[03:02:11.720 --> 03:02:16.120]  Totally agree with you. What did you think about my question of why they're declaring the end of pandemic?
[03:02:16.120 --> 03:02:20.520]  I was saying as a way to pose as the saviors and say they beat the last one
[03:02:20.680 --> 03:02:23.640]  So do we say on the next one? I think that's the paramount thing but
[03:02:24.280 --> 03:02:29.320]  Secondarily, I agree with the callers. It's also so they tell you when there's a pandemic and when there isn't they're in charge
[03:02:29.880 --> 03:02:36.360]  That's that's it. It's also that they're acclimating the people to who's in charge who's calling it
[03:02:36.360 --> 03:02:43.280]  You know, I mean look how people bounce down to this last one and and this was just the trial run
[03:02:43.560 --> 03:02:48.200]  Yeah, and they also want to get us used to the idea of
[03:02:49.240 --> 03:02:51.680]  Patterns, you know, there's a pattern to all of these
[03:02:52.400 --> 03:02:55.720]  Epidemics we got over this one. Now, there's going to be another one
[03:02:57.040 --> 03:03:01.760]  And they've said there's gonna be another one. Thank you so much Cindy. All right, Jay Dyer
[03:03:02.560 --> 03:03:06.320]  Is the best-selling author and researchers has a degree in studying media
[03:03:06.640 --> 03:03:10.340]  Well the smartest people out there about giving you the core documents from the enemy
[03:03:10.560 --> 03:03:12.760]  He's about to take over but I noticed again
[03:03:12.760 --> 03:03:15.680]  I was trending at the top of Twitter yesterday and they're promoting this video
[03:03:15.680 --> 03:03:19.080]  They take down as fast as it goes up. The whole video is like an hour long
[03:03:19.080 --> 03:03:24.600]  There's about a minute and a half we come back where I predicted 2002 exactly what would happen when the takeover happened
[03:03:24.760 --> 03:03:32.060]  So we're gonna play that clip. We come back and then Jay Dyer of Jay's analysis will be taking over today and then in one
[03:03:32.440 --> 03:03:34.840]  Hour like 57 minutes from now. Oh
[03:03:35.760 --> 03:03:42.600]  It's Royer 3 p.m. Central. And yes next week. We're going to the border with title 42 collapsing. We'll be down there
[03:03:42.760 --> 03:03:44.480]  I'll be down there
[03:03:44.480 --> 03:03:48.640]  We'll always have a crew member down there the next few weeks because this is a bomb going off
[03:03:48.640 --> 03:03:53.760]  This is didn't the border was broken before. This is the complete collapse. The border will be covering in here
[03:03:53.760 --> 03:03:55.760]  All the way we stay on air is your word of mouth
[03:03:55.800 --> 03:03:59.980]  Just as important as buying the product and spread the word is praying for the broadcast, please
[03:04:01.440 --> 03:04:06.120]  Pray for me pray for the crew pray for the operation pray for our discernment pray for a hedge of protection
[03:04:06.120 --> 03:04:10.280]  Please say God in fours isn't perfect. But what we love in fours and then fours loves you
[03:04:10.480 --> 03:04:16.080]  Please Heavenly Father sent angels to protect him for wars and the crew the name of Jesus Christ on man
[03:04:16.080 --> 03:04:22.020]  I need that prayer most important more than the word of mouth more than spread the word more than by the product
[03:04:22.640 --> 03:04:25.680]  Please pray for the broadcast. It's real
[03:04:26.000 --> 03:04:31.840]  It's a spiritual war and you see that now more than ever Tucker gets it and everybody else gets it Steven Crowder
[03:04:32.040 --> 03:04:38.160]  And even Joe Rogan's close understanding. It is a spiritual interdimensional attack. I need your prayer. I'm humbly
[03:04:38.800 --> 03:04:40.480]  Asking you right now
[03:04:40.480 --> 03:04:47.200]  We go to break to pray for this broadcast and our provision and our defense and our discernment lead God and direct us
[03:04:47.200 --> 03:04:50.520]  Never Jesus Christ. I'm in. I'm in. All right
[03:04:51.160 --> 03:04:55.520]  Jade, I are takes over our number four then Owen Schreier
[03:04:57.760 --> 03:05:02.200]  They decided to not perp walking not put him in handcuffs not do a mugshot
[03:05:02.520 --> 03:05:05.720]  Because they knew that that would help Trump didn't they know this would backfire
[03:05:06.360 --> 03:05:13.120]  We were waiting for the mugshot we learned today they wouldn't have it so we've made our own and it says political prisoner
[03:05:13.480 --> 03:05:17.880]  With an image of President Trump. The shirt is being printed now in Texas
[03:05:17.880 --> 03:05:23.640]  It'll be shipping out to you in one week political prisoner with Trump on the front
[03:05:23.640 --> 03:05:27.960]  They're in a mugshot jail background. It's a fundraiser shirt
[03:05:27.960 --> 03:05:34.760]  It says info wars comm on the back of the shirt. We also have Alex Jones for president. No, I'm not running for president
[03:05:34.760 --> 03:05:39.920]  It's a really nice navy blue high-quality shirt red white and blue. Alex Jones for president when 24
[03:05:39.920 --> 03:05:44.400]  It's a fun conversational piece and a limited-edition shirt great way to fund the operation
[03:05:44.400 --> 03:05:48.720]  So get your Alex Jones for president and Trump mugshot
[03:05:49.280 --> 03:05:51.280]  shirts at info war store
[03:05:51.920 --> 03:05:56.560]  Comm or by calling toll free triple-a two five three three one three nine
[03:05:56.560 --> 03:06:01.560]  21 years ago access television Alex Jones predicting what the enemy takeover would look like
[03:06:03.560 --> 03:06:08.160]  Yes, there have been corrupt empires, yes, they manipulate yes, there are secret societies
[03:06:08.160 --> 03:06:15.880]  Yes, there have been oligarchies throughout history. And yes today in 2002. There is a tyrannical organization calling itself
[03:06:15.880 --> 03:06:19.880]  Yes, there have been corrupt empires. Yes, they manipulate yes, there are secret societies
[03:06:19.880 --> 03:06:25.880]  Yes, there have been oligarchies throughout history. And yes today in 2002. There is a tyrannical organization
[03:06:25.880 --> 03:06:30.640]  Itself the New World Order pushing for world wide
[03:06:31.280 --> 03:06:33.280]  government a cashless society
[03:06:33.760 --> 03:06:36.480]  open borders total and complete
[03:06:37.000 --> 03:06:44.080]  Tyranny and by creating open borders where there's no national sovereignty and only global bodies that control all the resources
[03:06:44.720 --> 03:06:49.840]  by centralizing and socializing healthcare the state becomes God
[03:06:50.200 --> 03:06:55.120]  Basically when it comes to your health and then by releasing diseases and viruses and plagues
[03:06:55.640 --> 03:07:03.280]  Upon us. We then basically get shoved into their system. It's the ultimate goal that these people have in mind is the goal to
[03:07:04.360 --> 03:07:06.360]  create a one world government
[03:07:06.560 --> 03:07:09.200]  Run by the banking industry run by the bankers
[03:07:09.880 --> 03:07:13.800]  Right, there'll be no more cash and this is getting me straight from Rockefeller himself
[03:07:13.800 --> 03:07:17.040]  This is they want to accomplish and all money will be in your chips
[03:07:17.400 --> 03:07:23.400]  And if you like me or you and you're protesting what they're doing, they can just turn off your chip
[03:07:24.120 --> 03:07:26.560]  And you have nothing you can't buy foods
[03:07:27.120 --> 03:07:34.120]  You can't do anything. It's total control of people and that ships connected to a database that has your purchasing records what you do everything
[03:07:34.640 --> 03:07:36.640]  Everything is in there
[03:07:41.160 --> 03:07:47.480]  Welcome to the fourth hour of the oxygen. I'm your guest host Jay Dyer Jay's analysis, you know, we were talking last week about
[03:07:48.200 --> 03:07:49.480]  the
[03:07:49.480 --> 03:07:52.000]  Luciferian initiation that we read about
[03:07:52.680 --> 03:07:59.560]  In a lot of the globalist texts, especially the psychonauts and I talked about the doors of perception from Huxley
[03:07:59.560 --> 03:08:04.440]  And there's an amazing essay that was appended to this
[03:08:05.960 --> 03:08:08.880]  Book that I read last night and it's about
[03:08:09.280 --> 03:08:16.600]  His take on drugs and the drug war and all that and what the possibilities would be for the usage
[03:08:16.720 --> 03:08:23.200]  Of drugs in this so-called drug war and how drugs would actually be the future for
[03:08:24.000 --> 03:08:25.320]  controlling society
[03:08:25.320 --> 03:08:31.840]  So at the same time as the one hand admitting that brave new world is the discussion of a dystopia where everyone's controlled by drugs
[03:08:32.280 --> 03:08:39.320]  He also says amazingly that this drug society would also be freed up and it would be the new type of religion
[03:08:39.600 --> 03:08:42.360]  based around mystical direct experience
[03:08:42.920 --> 03:08:44.920]  through drugs
[03:08:45.160 --> 03:08:49.400]  So, which is it is is it a dystopia or is it a freeing?
[03:08:50.520 --> 03:08:52.520]  society based around
[03:08:52.720 --> 03:08:54.360]  libertarian
[03:08:54.360 --> 03:08:56.360]  Do what thou wilt?
[03:08:57.080 --> 03:09:02.200]  But the irony here is of course that all of the psychonauts had the same methodology
[03:09:02.200 --> 03:09:07.040]  And so after reading doors of perception, I went ahead and read his other text called heaven and hell
[03:09:07.040 --> 03:09:10.480]  Which is the second half of this book here doors of perception
[03:09:10.480 --> 03:09:16.120]  So I want to talk about some of the other psychonauts because he actually lists many of them. He mentions. Dr.
[03:09:16.120 --> 03:09:19.040]  John C. Lilly the dolphin creeper. He mentions
[03:09:19.680 --> 03:09:21.760]  the other MK ultra doctors and
[03:09:22.880 --> 03:09:26.880]  He doesn't say oh, this is a you know, a big conspiracy to change society
[03:09:27.760 --> 03:09:34.920]  Others of them actually do though. He says it's not a conspiracy to change society. It's a way to make everything better
[03:09:34.920 --> 03:09:36.920]  It's a way to give everybody
[03:09:37.320 --> 03:09:44.400]  Freedom to give everybody the holiday that they actually want which is from their own lives and from reality
[03:09:44.600 --> 03:09:50.040]  But if we go back to the 1960s, there's clips of even on YouTube of dr. Timothy Leary
[03:09:50.840 --> 03:09:54.920]  Openly saying as he sits underneath the banner of an Alistair Crowley
[03:09:55.680 --> 03:10:02.400]  poster of Christ with 666 above Christ's head to Timothy Leary saying that he worships and follows and continues the work of
[03:10:02.720 --> 03:10:04.200]  Alistair Crowley the beast
[03:10:04.200 --> 03:10:09.880]  He says I'm continuing this work and he says if you want to thank anybody for the 1960s counterculture revolution
[03:10:10.160 --> 03:10:14.200]  He says he made a look no further than the CIA who he was working for
[03:10:15.520 --> 03:10:23.320]  Other books like Jay Stevens books storming heaven talk about the history of utilizing drug warfare as a means of controlling society
[03:10:23.480 --> 03:10:28.440]  And even though many of these 60s counterculture people thought they were initiating a new society
[03:10:28.760 --> 03:10:32.200]  That would be based around more libertarian freedoms and whatnot
[03:10:32.200 --> 03:10:38.920]  It actually was giving way to and steering us towards a brave new world scenario of total control
[03:10:38.920 --> 03:10:44.760]  And so you might think well, is there some connection between? Yeah, that's the clip, right?
[03:10:44.760 --> 03:10:46.760]  There's other clips where he says the same thing
[03:10:47.280 --> 03:10:54.920]  But what about brain chips? What about transhumanism? What about the connection between MK ultra and the 1960s counterculture?
[03:10:54.920 --> 03:10:57.720]  Well, according to Huxley, it's all there. In fact in his essay
[03:10:58.440 --> 03:11:03.720]  At the end of this book, I'm not talking about heaven and hell. There's another essay called the drugs that shape men's minds
[03:11:04.200 --> 03:11:05.760]  He says that you know
[03:11:05.760 --> 03:11:11.600]  The more that we study drugs the more we will a we were able to understand the psychochemical makeup of mankind
[03:11:13.040 --> 03:11:20.760]  And of course the and he always layers it and masks it in this cloak of giving mankind freedom
[03:11:21.400 --> 03:11:26.520]  But he starts by saying that if you look at drugs actually drugs drug studies showed us that
[03:11:27.520 --> 03:11:33.760]  You can be born as an addict and maybe addiction he says maybe addiction is genetic
[03:11:34.480 --> 03:11:40.640]  They start talking about many of these things are actually genetic problems. And why does that matter? Well, if you look at his brother's
[03:11:41.160 --> 03:11:43.080]  writings, for example
[03:11:43.080 --> 03:11:44.920]  books on
[03:11:44.920 --> 03:11:50.040]  Revolutionary philosophy that Julian wrote Julian's book on the philosophy of UNESCO
[03:11:50.800 --> 03:11:52.440]  You notice that
[03:11:52.440 --> 03:11:56.840]  they see man as a completely biologically determined entity and
[03:11:57.360 --> 03:12:01.480]  So a man's a biologically determined entity if he's only made up of chemical
[03:12:02.240 --> 03:12:07.200]  Reactions then it stands to reason the way you would treat people would be through other chemicals
[03:12:07.680 --> 03:12:09.960]  So man is a psychochemical being
[03:12:10.520 --> 03:12:14.840]  We're going to steer him and control him through external stimuli and psychochemical
[03:12:15.720 --> 03:12:17.400]  psychophysical means
[03:12:17.400 --> 03:12:20.960]  And that's something that pretty much all of the mk ultra doctors held in common
[03:12:22.040 --> 03:12:23.640]  now
[03:12:23.640 --> 03:12:29.120]  Huxley is a bit of an outlier on this specific point because he thinks that man isn't
[03:12:30.240 --> 03:12:36.640]  Solely a physical being he doesn't exactly know how to explain it or what's going on with the spiritual realm
[03:12:36.640 --> 03:12:40.840]  but he does say that when people engage in various drug trips and
[03:12:41.400 --> 03:12:43.080]  Masculine DMT all these kinds of things
[03:12:43.080 --> 03:12:51.160]  He says that it is tapping into other dimensions and other regions that areas of the brain somehow function as gateways to that's his view
[03:12:51.160 --> 03:12:54.360]  So I think that's weird and whatever. That's his view. That's what he thinks
[03:12:54.360 --> 03:12:57.320]  That was part of the point of the essay of heaven and hell
[03:12:58.400 --> 03:12:59.360]  but
[03:12:59.360 --> 03:13:01.360]  Whether you believe in a spiritual realm or not
[03:13:01.520 --> 03:13:07.560]  The people who he's working with his compatriots the other people involved in the mk ultra project
[03:13:07.880 --> 03:13:11.520]  And I think that as we read this essay we actually find out that
[03:13:12.000 --> 03:13:19.200]  He's absolutely 100% tied up and involved in mk ultra. He's just in the British version of it, which preceded the American
[03:13:19.720 --> 03:13:20.880]  version of it
[03:13:20.880 --> 03:13:26.280]  And he says that one of the things that comes out of a lot of these mystical experiences is the idea that we are all
[03:13:26.280 --> 03:13:27.520]  one
[03:13:27.520 --> 03:13:30.200]  Monism the idea that oh, we're all one dude
[03:13:31.600 --> 03:13:33.600]  Is that the case though? Are we all one?
[03:13:34.200 --> 03:13:40.600]  Well in a lot of these philosophies and these were religions where you have the idea that everybody and everything is ultimately only one
[03:13:40.960 --> 03:13:45.240]  There's this idea that we got to get rid of all of the things that make us distinct
[03:13:45.800 --> 03:13:52.880]  and so that's actually a very useful philosophy for the global power structure because if everything is one it gives them a
[03:13:53.520 --> 03:13:56.680]  Basis to say that we got to erase and destroy all of your unique
[03:13:57.360 --> 03:14:03.800]  Identifying attributes cultures heritage, etc. Everything must be blended into the global blob and
[03:14:04.320 --> 03:14:10.440]  Believe it or not. Aldous Huxley wrote another book called the perennial philosophy where he argues that the future world religion
[03:14:10.720 --> 03:14:14.160]  That's emerging that will come about will be a generic
[03:14:14.720 --> 03:14:17.360]  syncretic blending of all the religions into a
[03:14:18.640 --> 03:14:22.440]  Monistic blob all is one because when the religious mystics
[03:14:23.000 --> 03:14:26.400]  When they have their mystical experiences while they all realize that we're all one man
[03:14:27.400 --> 03:14:32.920]  And he says that we could look to the ancient religious sects like the Bacchanal insect
[03:14:33.400 --> 03:14:36.840]  the Greeks who worshipped Dionysius and Bacchus
[03:14:37.440 --> 03:14:41.720]  Because they felt that through wine or through imbibing alcohol
[03:14:41.720 --> 03:14:45.800]  They would immediately tap into some sort of mystical unity with the one
[03:14:47.080 --> 03:14:52.020]  And he goes on to say that societies that give in to chemical dependency
[03:14:52.960 --> 03:14:54.960]  end up controlled and
[03:14:55.240 --> 03:15:00.600]  He mentions the history of opium and the history of you know, British Empires opium war this kind of stuff
[03:15:00.600 --> 03:15:06.800]  He goes into this in some detail and you begin to see that this is not just an essay about
[03:15:07.760 --> 03:15:15.480]  Mystical experience and liberation through drug experience is actually a an essay on the sociological control mechanism behind drugs
[03:15:16.900 --> 03:15:22.940]  And that the power structure has known this for a long time and you remember last week I talked about
[03:15:23.859 --> 03:15:28.580]  indoors of perception and he said a lot of similar things he talked about the connection between
[03:15:29.020 --> 03:15:33.560]  Drugs and society and how when he wrote brave new world that was really what he was thinking about was
[03:15:34.500 --> 03:15:39.060]  Preparing for and sketching out the future dystopia control mechanism
[03:15:39.220 --> 03:15:43.500]  But I'm trying to explain to you that this just comes out of the older British model
[03:15:44.140 --> 03:15:44.940]  Of
[03:15:44.940 --> 03:15:52.900]  Imperial warfare not just through gone bun guns and bombs and whatnot, but also through cultural warfare through drug warfare
[03:15:53.619 --> 03:15:56.180]  Don't go anywhere. This is the option. I'm sure you guys says jade
[03:15:56.180 --> 03:15:57.420]  I'm doing every time I talk to you
[03:15:57.420 --> 03:16:04.300]  You're either like on the border exposing the cartels in like coming under fire or you're on the streets of some American city hanging
[03:16:04.300 --> 03:16:09.020]  Out with drug addicts and criminals and now you've gone to ground zero of a massive chemical spill
[03:16:09.020 --> 03:16:12.820]  Are you addicted to the danger Savannah? Have you ever considered that for a second?
[03:16:12.820 --> 03:16:17.580]  No, I'm addicted to helping my fellow Americans. I'm addicted to spreading the truth
[03:16:17.580 --> 03:16:21.180]  And again, I you know, I have info words to thank for that looking back on the day
[03:16:21.180 --> 03:16:23.820]  I was able to ask President Donald Trump two questions
[03:16:23.820 --> 03:16:26.340]  I was so grateful because you know
[03:16:26.340 --> 03:16:30.180]  I truly was classically trained under Alex Jones and under the Infowars team
[03:16:30.180 --> 03:16:33.660]  I really do credit that as to why I'm able to you know
[03:16:33.660 --> 03:16:37.580]  Get these types of clips because Alex's whole mentality was, you know
[03:16:37.619 --> 03:16:42.740]  Go where the story is go where the mainstream media refuses to so it's not that I'm addicted
[03:16:42.820 --> 03:16:44.020]  to the insanity
[03:16:44.020 --> 03:16:49.580]  I'm just addicted telling the truth and helping the American people and I really do credit Alex for you know
[03:16:49.580 --> 03:16:51.980]  Living and filling that within me early on in my career
[03:16:56.580 --> 03:16:57.539]  Just weeks ago
[03:16:57.539 --> 03:16:58.260]  I
[03:16:58.260 --> 03:17:03.779]  Warned the world that the globalists were gonna move against Tucker Carlson and take him off the air people said no way
[03:17:03.779 --> 03:17:07.260]  He's the most pop would ever happen. They've got quadrillions and stolen money
[03:17:07.260 --> 03:17:10.100]  They only had their curls on the air because they believe they control him
[03:17:10.100 --> 03:17:13.060]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't he was taken off the air
[03:17:13.060 --> 03:17:14.859]  It's the same thing with Infowars
[03:17:14.859 --> 03:17:21.619]  But Infowars is not owned by Fox or controlled by George Soros or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan

[03:18:47.500 --> 03:18:49.500]  absolutely imperative mineral fusion

[03:18:56.180 --> 03:19:00.580]  They decided to not perp walking not put him in handcuffs not do a mugshot
[03:19:00.940 --> 03:19:04.140]  Because they knew that that would help Trump didn't they know this would backfire
[03:19:04.779 --> 03:19:07.820]  We were waiting for the mugshot. We learned today. They wouldn't have it
[03:19:07.820 --> 03:19:11.539]  So we've made our own and it says political prisoner
[03:19:11.900 --> 03:19:16.300]  With an image of President Trump the shirt is being printed now in Texas

[03:19:58.220 --> 03:20:04.020]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones
[03:20:06.000 --> 03:20:15.360]  Welcome back to The Austin Show, I'm your host, Jay Dyer, and in today's analysis we're
[03:20:15.360 --> 03:20:21.680]  talking about the control of society through cultural warfare, which doesn't begin with
[03:20:21.680 --> 03:20:27.360]  the 1960s or even the 50s, it goes back to the drug war.
[03:20:27.360 --> 03:20:32.320]  And I don't mean the drug war of the Reagan era and the DARE program, I'm talking about
[03:20:32.320 --> 03:20:39.600]  the British Empire and their strategy of making a lot of money and exercising a lot of cultural
[03:20:39.600 --> 03:20:43.120]  influence and control through the sale of opium.
[03:20:43.120 --> 03:20:51.960]  And when we look at the history of pharmacology, we see that, again, I'm emphasizing this because
[03:20:51.960 --> 03:20:59.080]  I want you to understand that the idea of culture warfare, which is a huge part of what
[03:20:59.080 --> 03:21:05.040]  we're experiencing today, what we're undergoing, you can see that this is old.
[03:21:05.040 --> 03:21:06.040]  It's not new.
[03:21:06.040 --> 03:21:10.520]  A lot of people are still, they can't understand the idea that culture is created and steered.
[03:21:10.520 --> 03:21:12.520]  They think that it's just a purely organic thing.
[03:21:12.520 --> 03:21:17.080]  And I'm trying to explain to you that if you can understand that through the history of
[03:21:17.080 --> 03:21:21.400]  drug warfare, that that's a huge part of culture war.
[03:21:21.400 --> 03:21:24.440]  You can begin to see that our society is really controlled.
[03:21:24.440 --> 03:21:30.360]  Our society is a top-down dystopia that kind of already exists.
[03:21:30.360 --> 03:21:36.040]  And in Huxley's scenario, he's describing the future religion, the future society in
[03:21:36.040 --> 03:21:38.600]  an essay that's not part of Brave New World.
[03:21:38.600 --> 03:21:45.240]  And he's not saying that this is going to be, you know, some top-down thing, but it will
[03:21:45.240 --> 03:21:46.240]  be introduced.
[03:21:46.240 --> 03:21:48.280]  That's where it starts getting wilder and wilder in this essay.
[03:21:48.280 --> 03:21:54.840]  It says that there will be future drug laws against certain drugs, but there will be
[03:21:54.840 --> 03:22:00.600]  the proliferation of other drugs precisely for social control.
[03:22:00.600 --> 03:22:06.480]  And he even goes on to say that psychiatry is engaged right now.
[03:22:06.480 --> 03:22:13.800]  He's writing this back in the 50s, I think, when he wrote this essay, in perfecting pharmacological
[03:22:13.800 --> 03:22:23.680]  means for creating new drugs and new synthetic ways of escapism, so that eventually there
[03:22:23.680 --> 03:22:32.360]  can be the release of this on society to the extent that chemical restraint will enable
[03:22:32.360 --> 03:22:38.360]  the dictatorships of tomorrow to actually deprive men of their freedom, who will willingly
[03:22:38.360 --> 03:22:45.120]  give it away in exchange for a chemical-synthetic form of happiness.
[03:22:45.120 --> 03:22:50.280]  All of this, he says, will be chemically induced, and thus man's achievements may turn out to
[03:22:50.280 --> 03:22:58.360]  be incompatible in terms of liberty and freedom and economic—none of that will compare to
[03:22:58.360 --> 03:23:03.800]  the pleasures that he will get from future drugs and future synthetic control mechanisms.
[03:23:03.800 --> 03:23:07.240]  And what I'm getting at here is that he's not talking about street drugs.
[03:23:07.240 --> 03:23:11.720]  I mean, obviously there are street drugs, but in my view, yes, fentanyl and all that
[03:23:11.720 --> 03:23:17.880]  is totally a ridiculous, absurd crisis that's engineered and so forth, but I'm talking about
[03:23:17.880 --> 03:23:18.880]  big pharma.
[03:23:18.880 --> 03:23:23.320]  That's the real drug dealers, and they're at the top of the pyramid.
[03:23:23.320 --> 03:23:28.640]  And the big pharmaceutical companies who were intently involved in the last three years
[03:23:28.640 --> 03:23:35.640]  of billions of dollars of profit and controlling a society on an unbelievable scale in the last
[03:23:35.640 --> 03:23:39.360]  three years of nonsense, that's what he's talking about.
[03:23:39.360 --> 03:23:45.520]  He's saying that you're going to be under a medical-pharmaceutical dictatorship of the
[03:23:45.520 --> 03:23:52.320]  future, not a jackboot dictatorship—I mean, in some places it turned out to be that, like
[03:23:52.320 --> 03:23:53.320]  Australia.
[03:23:53.320 --> 03:23:55.280]  But who was really calling the shots?
[03:23:55.280 --> 03:23:57.960]  It wasn't really Fauci.
[03:23:57.960 --> 03:24:02.520]  It was the international oligarchic elite that run these corporations.
[03:24:02.520 --> 03:24:04.800]  That's who's calling the shots.
[03:24:04.960 --> 03:24:10.680]  And that is who was really in the background of MKUltra and all of this widespread research.
[03:24:10.680 --> 03:24:15.880]  Yes, there's government elements to it, but it's flip sides of the same coin, right?
[03:24:15.880 --> 03:24:20.720]  The big pharmaceutical companies, the big corporations, they're in a revolving-door
[03:24:20.720 --> 03:24:25.880]  scenario with the people who go to the CDC, who go to all the government agencies.
[03:24:25.880 --> 03:24:28.400]  They're the same people.
[03:24:28.400 --> 03:24:31.800]  And so it might as well be a government owned by these people.
[03:24:32.800 --> 03:24:39.800]  And so these people, these pharmaceutical companies, these are the ones that were studying MKUltra.
[03:24:39.800 --> 03:24:44.800]  Yes, again, there was army military research, but that's not who's really calling the shots.
[03:24:44.800 --> 03:24:46.800]  It's these companies.
[03:24:46.800 --> 03:24:53.800]  And they were the ones studying intently the effects of peyote, the effects of LSD,
[03:24:53.800 --> 03:24:57.800]  and all of its derivatives back in the 1950s and 60s.
[03:24:58.800 --> 03:25:02.800]  And they weren't studying it because they were interested in human liberation.
[03:25:02.800 --> 03:25:06.800]  They were studying it because they wanted, yes, to synthesize it,
[03:25:06.800 --> 03:25:09.800]  have synthetic versions of all these things for human control, sure.
[03:25:09.800 --> 03:25:13.800]  But it's ultimately about social control.
[03:25:15.200 --> 03:25:19.200]  In culture, it was not about primarily creating super soldiers.
[03:25:20.200 --> 03:25:24.200]  Not about assassins. It's about social control on a mass scale.
[03:25:26.800 --> 03:25:37.480]  And a big part of that is not just the drug culture, it's the toxic pop culture. Those
[03:25:37.480 --> 03:25:43.480]  two things go together because they come out of the same labs, so to speak. He goes on
[03:25:43.480 --> 03:25:50.539]  to mention that in his day it was being intently studied, the ascetic practices of various
[03:25:50.539 --> 03:25:56.480]  mystics of different religions, Fakirs of India, and their bodily punishments and whatnot
[03:25:56.480 --> 03:26:01.880]  that would lead to altered states of consciousness. He mentions John C. Lilly, the float tanks,
[03:26:01.880 --> 03:26:10.880]  all this kind of stuff. He says that ultimately all of this is being combined into a future
[03:26:10.880 --> 03:26:18.800]  offering that will be given to the population, to the public, to control them and make them
[03:26:18.800 --> 03:26:24.080]  happy. He says all of these things will soon be on the market. How did he know that? How
[03:26:24.480 --> 03:26:31.599]  did he know that all of these high-level drugs would soon be on the market? And in my view,
[03:26:31.599 --> 03:26:36.560]  this is a big part of why so many people in society are going nuts. There's the toxic
[03:26:36.560 --> 03:26:43.840]  culture, the brainwashing in the schools, the terrible food and diet, the stabbies,
[03:26:43.840 --> 03:26:51.519]  but there's also countless people on countless pharmaceutical drugs, bombing their minds
[03:26:51.519 --> 03:26:55.560]  on a daily basis, and they have been for decades. Because if you remember back in
[03:26:55.560 --> 03:27:00.240]  the 90s is when they really started pushing, for example, the SSRIs, the pharmaceutical
[03:27:00.240 --> 03:27:07.039]  answers to you having a bad day. Oh, it's unnatural. It's abnormal. You've been diagnosed
[03:27:07.039 --> 03:27:13.960]  with a genetic predisposition to depression. And so it's a chemical imbalance, all based
[03:27:13.960 --> 03:27:18.439]  around the idea that just throwing chemicals at a problem solves the problem, because man
[03:27:18.439 --> 03:27:23.320]  is just chemical reactions anyway, right? But ironically, Huxley is basically saying
[03:27:23.320 --> 03:27:30.160]  that you understand what's been rolled out as a control mechanism. And we just watched
[03:27:30.160 --> 03:27:37.080]  Apocalypto the other day. Remember the Mel Gibson movie? Great movie. And, you know,
[03:27:37.080 --> 03:27:43.359]  when you get to the last, you know, the third of the movie, the climax of the film, when
[03:27:43.359 --> 03:27:52.080]  they get to the temples, the ziggurats, the Mayan Empire, you'll notice that the society
[03:27:52.080 --> 03:27:56.560]  is based around even this drug experience. It's not really highlighted in the movie,
[03:27:56.560 --> 03:28:01.240]  but they were really into those hallucinogenic drugs, you know, in the Mayan Inc. and all
[03:28:01.240 --> 03:28:06.519]  those kinds of Latin South America, Central America civilizations. And in my view, that's
[03:28:06.519 --> 03:28:10.759]  that's kind of how they thought they were tapping into these other worlds and the shaman
[03:28:10.759 --> 03:28:14.599]  and the high priest and these people. And they were being told, oh, we have to require
[03:28:14.599 --> 03:28:19.400]  human sacrifice. I'm not saying that everybody that does hallucinogens is going to require
[03:28:19.400 --> 03:28:25.340]  human sacrifice or be initiated into a Mayan cult. I'm just saying that that's a feature
[03:28:25.340 --> 03:28:30.900]  of that religion, those religions and those cultures. And they did start requiring and
[03:28:30.900 --> 03:28:34.880]  asking for human sacrifice on a mass scale as part of social control. They weren't just
[03:28:34.880 --> 03:28:39.000]  mad people out of their minds. They were, but they were also very interested in social
[03:28:39.039 --> 03:28:42.800]  control. And in that movie, they know that the eclipse is coming. And so they duped the
[03:28:42.800 --> 03:28:48.119]  population who doesn't know calendars and dates and they don't know that it's an eclipse.
[03:28:48.119 --> 03:28:51.599]  And so they've fooled the population into thinking that they can kill and resurrect
[03:28:51.599 --> 03:28:54.920]  the sun, right? The high priest and the emperor don't go anywhere. This is the Alex Jones
[03:28:54.920 --> 03:29:01.920]  show. I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had. I don't think anybody can
[03:29:01.920 --> 03:29:07.880]  deny it. And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us. When we talk about the
[03:29:07.880 --> 03:29:12.800]  crew at Infowars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really
[03:29:12.800 --> 03:29:18.000]  have been the MVPs in this fight. And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer
[03:29:18.000 --> 03:29:23.160]  and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really
[03:29:23.160 --> 03:29:27.880]  just incredible. So for myself and the whole Infowars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[03:29:27.880 --> 03:29:32.720]  And I want to encourage you now to realize that Infowars cannot stay on air if you do
[03:29:32.720 --> 03:29:36.840]  not support us. I know you spread the word. I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful.
[03:29:36.840 --> 03:29:41.720]  Keep doing it. But most viewers and listeners never go to InfowarsStore.com, and you never
[03:29:41.720 --> 03:29:45.199]  buy great products that enrich and empower your life, all at the same time keeping us
[03:29:45.199 --> 03:29:50.560]  on air. I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:29:50.560 --> 03:29:54.679]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfowarsStore.com, our funding problems
[03:29:54.679 --> 03:30:00.000]  will be over. Please take action now. Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers
[03:30:00.000 --> 03:30:05.199]  and listeners that have gone to InfowarsStore.com and gotten the great products that enrich
[03:30:05.199 --> 03:30:10.720]  your life, that empower your immune system and your body, and keep us on air. I am humbly
[03:30:10.720 --> 03:30:15.599]  hand-in-hand talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in, many of you for years,
[03:30:15.599 --> 03:30:20.960]  and never gone to InfowarsStore.com. We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you
[03:30:20.960 --> 03:30:25.080]  never actually go to InfowarsStore.com and never experience these great products and
[03:30:25.080 --> 03:30:28.679]  never fund the operation. Sure, you share a link, you share an article, you tell folks
[03:30:28.679 --> 03:30:32.720]  about the show. That's great, and I thank you. But we need funds to operate. Plus, we've
[03:30:32.720 --> 03:30:36.599]  got really great products that do amazing things for people, like our CBD oil, and our
[03:30:36.599 --> 03:30:41.240]  fizzy magnesium, and our sleep aid, and our nitric oxide, and our real red pill. Plus,
[03:30:41.240 --> 03:30:44.640]  all of these are really great products that keep us on air. Plus, you're missing out
[03:30:44.640 --> 03:30:48.679]  on having these products. So get off the bench, get in the game, step to the plate, and go
[03:30:48.679 --> 03:30:55.679]  to InfowarsStore.com right now and get these great Infowars products at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:30:56.439 --> 03:30:59.439]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[03:31:04.439 --> 03:31:07.439]  I want you all to know something. Alex Jones was right.
[03:31:07.439 --> 03:31:11.439]  Alex is right about far more than he's wrong.
[03:31:11.439 --> 03:31:14.439]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[03:31:14.439 --> 03:31:20.439]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up, or rub it down. Alex Jones was right.
[03:31:20.439 --> 03:31:25.439]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two. Imagine being
[03:31:25.439 --> 03:31:28.199]  awake and Alex Jones or those guys have been awake for like decades.
[03:31:28.199 --> 03:31:32.199]  Alex Jones called this years ago. Years ago.
[03:31:32.199 --> 03:31:36.199]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax. Not for a second.
[03:31:36.199 --> 03:31:39.199]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[03:31:39.199 --> 03:31:41.199]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[03:31:41.199 --> 03:31:44.199]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[03:31:44.199 --> 03:31:49.199]  That's why the globalists hate me. It's because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[03:31:56.199 --> 03:32:02.199]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution is laying right there in front of you hidden in plain view.
[03:32:02.199 --> 03:32:05.199]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[03:32:05.199 --> 03:32:12.199]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website where they admit the number one cause of cognitive disability
[03:32:12.199 --> 03:32:15.199]  in the world is iodine deficiency.
[03:32:15.199 --> 03:32:23.199]  The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability is lack of real pure iodine in the body
[03:32:23.960 --> 03:32:28.960]  as they bomb us with the bad halogens bromine, bromide, chlorine and so much more.
[03:32:28.960 --> 03:32:35.960]  Upwards of 2 billion people in a Lancet medical journal study in 2007 worldwide have cognitive disabilities
[03:32:35.960 --> 03:32:38.960]  because they don't have high quality iodine.
[03:32:38.960 --> 03:32:40.960]  Most iodine is bound to other elements you don't absorb it.
[03:32:40.960 --> 03:32:46.960]  We have X3, all three types of good iodine together that supercharges your body.
[03:32:46.960 --> 03:32:49.960]  X3 is now back in stock at InfoWarsTour.com.
[03:32:49.960 --> 03:32:52.960]  It's been sold out for over 6 months for 25% off.
[03:32:53.720 --> 03:32:56.720]  X3 back in stock. Take action now. InfoWarsTour.com.
[03:32:57.720 --> 03:33:01.720]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:33:01.720 --> 03:33:03.720]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:05.300 --> 03:33:15.699]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm your guest host Jay and I are Jay Zanossis.
[03:33:15.699 --> 03:33:21.980]  We are going through the plans and the machinations of the oligarchs and their discussions very
[03:33:21.980 --> 03:33:28.140]  open by the way, hidden in plain sight of what they plan to do with a lot of the technological
[03:33:28.140 --> 03:33:35.279]  means as well as the drug means of controlling society and erecting the brave new world scenario.
[03:33:35.279 --> 03:33:42.160]  And I found this sort of obscure essay from Huxley covering how drugs affect men's minds
[03:33:42.160 --> 03:33:47.599]  and he ends this essay by talking about a future world religion and it just made me
[03:33:47.599 --> 03:33:53.560]  think about what I'd watched in Apocalypto, the excellent Mel Gibson film, where you had
[03:33:53.560 --> 03:33:59.560]  the high priest and the emperor there engaged in the human sacrifice and that they had duped
[03:33:59.560 --> 03:34:04.759]  all the people because they knew about the calendar and the eclipse that was coming and
[03:34:04.759 --> 03:34:09.039]  the people thought, oh, well, I guess he was able to resurrect the sun.
[03:34:09.039 --> 03:34:14.000]  And I was pointing out that when the Gordon Wasson and these different figures who were
[03:34:14.000 --> 03:34:20.320]  actually bankers went and studied the cultures in Latin South America, Central America to
[03:34:20.320 --> 03:34:25.279]  understand the mushroom, to understand the ergot and all that, to synthesize and create
[03:34:25.279 --> 03:34:30.560]  LSD, which is what eventually happened, you know, that actually came from a banker.
[03:34:30.560 --> 03:34:35.199]  And he was part of the Macy Foundation, this figure Gordon Wasson and his wife.
[03:34:35.199 --> 03:34:40.320]  And they figured out how to synthesize LSD and that was later Sandoz Pharmaceuticals
[03:34:40.320 --> 03:34:42.439]  and the CIA and all that.
[03:34:42.439 --> 03:34:43.439]  They were definitely involved in this.
[03:34:43.439 --> 03:34:48.880]  But you begin to see the interlinking of these organizations, government entities, as well
[03:34:48.880 --> 03:34:52.240]  as these giant pharmaceutical companies.
[03:34:52.240 --> 03:34:58.320]  And Huxley says that, you know, one of the reasons that these societies were studied
[03:34:58.320 --> 03:35:02.560]  was the amazing amount of control.
[03:35:02.560 --> 03:35:07.640]  That could be had when you take something like the drug trip and you turn it into a
[03:35:07.640 --> 03:35:10.720]  social control mechanism, right?
[03:35:10.720 --> 03:35:12.439]  And that's what he's describing in this essay.
[03:35:12.439 --> 03:35:16.320]  He's saying that we will even get the churches on board.
[03:35:16.320 --> 03:35:17.320]  Now, this didn't really happen.
[03:35:17.320 --> 03:35:20.160]  The churches didn't really hop on board with psychedelics.
[03:35:20.160 --> 03:35:24.560]  Maybe some churches did, but he says that maybe we could try to get the churches involved
[03:35:24.560 --> 03:35:25.560]  in this.
[03:35:25.560 --> 03:35:28.599]  Maybe the churches don't go along with the counterculture that's coming.
[03:35:28.599 --> 03:35:31.400]  By the way, how do you know that the drug counterculture was coming?
[03:35:31.400 --> 03:35:37.679]  How did he know in the 50s that the 60s counterculture revolution was coming if it wasn't, if it
[03:35:37.679 --> 03:35:38.679]  was an organic revolution?
[03:35:38.679 --> 03:35:39.679]  It wasn't organic.
[03:35:39.679 --> 03:35:47.400]  It was steered by Esalen Institute, by these foundations, by the pharmaceutical companies,
[03:35:47.400 --> 03:35:50.039]  changing images of man.
[03:35:50.039 --> 03:35:55.519]  White papers written about using counterculture, using alternative lifestyles to steer society.
[03:35:56.480 --> 03:35:59.880]  That is why all of this is out in the public now.
[03:35:59.880 --> 03:36:05.640]  All of the T-R-A-N-S agenda, all of the V-E-G agenda.
[03:36:05.640 --> 03:36:08.160]  Do you understand this all comes out of think tanks?
[03:36:08.160 --> 03:36:14.679]  It's not just random liberals organically deciding to come up with stuff.
[03:36:14.679 --> 03:36:16.560]  It's not just random professors.
[03:36:16.560 --> 03:36:21.960]  All of this comes out of Tavistock, think tanks, Rand, MIT.
[03:36:21.960 --> 03:36:27.160]  They come up with this and they push it in society, just like they pushed the last three
[03:36:27.160 --> 03:36:28.160]  years of stuff.
[03:36:28.160 --> 03:36:37.560]  It was war game for decades with all these different event scenarios, Blade X, 201, Crimson
[03:36:37.560 --> 03:36:41.759]  Contagion, on and on and on, lockstep.
[03:36:41.759 --> 03:36:48.480]  Well, in the same way, the same countless think tanks, NGOs, foundations, war game and
[03:36:48.480 --> 03:36:57.519]  roll out new religions, new ideological movements, new scenarios to steer society.
[03:36:57.519 --> 03:37:01.039]  And the 60s counterculture was crucial for where we are now.
[03:37:01.039 --> 03:37:07.560]  Do you think you could have the rainbow revolution and the trans revolution without the 60s counterculture?
[03:37:07.560 --> 03:37:08.560]  No, of course not.
[03:37:08.560 --> 03:37:16.880]  So, but it comes in phases and it's just the latest instantiation of revolution.
[03:37:16.880 --> 03:37:20.519]  And that's, by the way, one of the elements that Huxley got right that George Orwell did
[03:37:20.519 --> 03:37:25.400]  not get right, which is the intense sexual element of the dystopia.
[03:37:25.400 --> 03:37:28.640]  The clown world dystopia is a rainbow dystopia.
[03:37:28.700 --> 03:37:40.620]  It's not just a dystopia of a Stalin-esque, you know, top-down dictatorship.
[03:37:40.620 --> 03:37:48.580]  It's the pleasure-based model of pharmacological and sexicological control.
[03:37:48.580 --> 03:37:50.860]  I made up that word.
[03:37:50.860 --> 03:37:56.700]  And so Huxley says that if we don't get this world religion, it's eventually going to emerge
[03:37:56.700 --> 03:37:57.700]  on its own.
[03:37:57.700 --> 03:38:03.100]  It's a new world religion that emerges out of the spiritual experience of the beyond
[03:38:03.100 --> 03:38:07.900]  through people taking drugs and rejecting institutional churches and religions.
[03:38:07.900 --> 03:38:13.820]  And, of course, the oligarchs have captured most of the institutional churches anyway.
[03:38:13.820 --> 03:38:15.860]  So they're captured institutions.
[03:38:15.860 --> 03:38:18.580]  So you can see how they sort of game it both ways.
[03:38:18.580 --> 03:38:21.860]  Well, that the religious institutions are captured and they're turned into essentially
[03:38:21.860 --> 03:38:25.780]  just liberal NGOs and forms of soft power.
[03:38:25.780 --> 03:38:27.660]  That's what most of the churches are.
[03:38:27.660 --> 03:38:31.580]  And now people will turn to alternative religions and alternative religious experience.
[03:38:31.580 --> 03:38:34.780]  And those are also promoted by the exact same oligarchs.
[03:38:34.780 --> 03:38:36.700]  That's what Leary is saying in these essays.
[03:38:36.700 --> 03:38:40.020]  And again, he says that this will come.
[03:38:40.020 --> 03:38:41.260]  You will have this rolled out.
[03:38:41.260 --> 03:38:43.540]  How does he know?
[03:38:43.540 --> 03:38:44.540]  Is he a prophet?
[03:38:44.540 --> 03:38:45.540]  No.
[03:38:45.540 --> 03:38:49.820]  He's part of this inner structure, part of these people who know what they're rolling
[03:38:49.820 --> 03:38:52.940]  out and they talk about worshiping and serving Lucifer.
[03:38:52.940 --> 03:38:55.620]  Now some of them think that's a symbolic thing.
[03:38:55.620 --> 03:38:58.140]  They don't think that there's some real spirit.
[03:38:58.140 --> 03:39:05.300]  They just see it as a Promethean symbol to emulate, to be like the rebel angel.
[03:39:05.300 --> 03:39:12.060]  They see it as something to model yourself as, as a kind of rebel against even nature
[03:39:12.060 --> 03:39:13.060]  itself.
[03:39:13.060 --> 03:39:14.060]  Right.
[03:39:14.060 --> 03:39:20.420]  To transcend humanity, transcending the limitations of nature and the created order.
[03:39:20.420 --> 03:39:26.620]  And so we get people like Dr. John C. Lilly, who begins to have fixations for dolphins
[03:39:26.620 --> 03:39:30.260]  and he gives them LSD and it puts brain chips in the dolphins.
[03:39:30.260 --> 03:39:33.260]  I mean, it's just mad science people.
[03:39:33.260 --> 03:39:34.340]  Okay.
[03:39:34.340 --> 03:39:40.100]  But they also typically talk about interacting with the entities on the other side.
[03:39:40.100 --> 03:39:45.460]  Both Huxley and John C. Lilly talk about on their intense drug trips, getting information
[03:39:45.460 --> 03:39:50.140]  and getting interaction with entities.
[03:39:50.140 --> 03:39:56.940]  The clockwork elves of Terrence McKenna, talking to beings, having conferences with
[03:39:56.940 --> 03:39:57.940]  these entities.
[03:39:57.940 --> 03:40:02.500]  If you've watched the movie Altered States with William Hurt, right?
[03:40:02.500 --> 03:40:05.340]  Exactly what's in that film.
[03:40:05.340 --> 03:40:09.020]  And so you have these figures continuing on this research from the time of Huxley on until
[03:40:09.020 --> 03:40:16.940]  now and even still to this day, MIT, Berkeley, various universities doing the same types
[03:40:16.940 --> 03:40:22.980]  of research with very powerful hallucinogenic drugs to try to tap into the other side.
[03:40:22.980 --> 03:40:25.940]  But here's the question that's never asked.
[03:40:25.940 --> 03:40:28.780]  How do we know that the entities are good entities?
[03:40:28.780 --> 03:40:31.500]  It's just the assumption is that, well, it's a spiritual experience.
[03:40:31.500 --> 03:40:32.500]  It must be good.
[03:40:32.500 --> 03:40:35.660]  Well, maybe they're lying, deceptive spiritual experiences.
[03:40:35.660 --> 03:40:40.140]  Maybe the entities that are telling you to have a world government and to kill everybody,
[03:40:40.140 --> 03:40:41.140]  maybe they're bad guys.
[03:40:41.140 --> 03:40:42.140]  Have you ever think about that?
[03:40:42.140 --> 03:40:43.140]  Maybe they're demons.
[03:40:43.140 --> 03:40:44.140]  Oh, it's crazy.
[03:40:44.140 --> 03:40:45.140]  You're a fundamentalist.
[03:40:45.140 --> 03:40:49.140]  Well, I mean, you're sitting here telling me that entities are telling you to kill everybody.
[03:40:49.140 --> 03:40:51.140]  Sounds like a demon to me.
[03:40:52.200 --> 03:40:55.200]  I mean, why do they always have the same message?
[03:40:55.200 --> 03:40:58.200]  They always say, erect a world government.
[03:40:58.900 --> 03:41:02.900]  Cut down the population. That's exactly what all these people say.
[03:41:02.900 --> 03:41:06.900]  So, maybe these people are inspired by a malevolent force.
[03:41:06.900 --> 03:41:08.900]  Well, how come nobody considers that option?
[03:41:08.900 --> 03:41:11.900]  Seems pretty no-brainer to me.
[03:41:11.900 --> 03:41:16.900]  But, I guess if you don't have any discernment, you wouldn't be able to see that.
[03:41:16.900 --> 03:41:19.900]  Your discernment is gone. Lost.
[03:41:20.500 --> 03:41:28.820]  In fact, in McKenna's books, for example, who's continuing on this tradition in his
[03:41:28.820 --> 03:41:32.100]  Food of the Gods, he says, I'm continuing the work of Timothy Leary and all of these
[03:41:32.100 --> 03:41:38.460]  people, and I want to bring a shamanic initiation, and that's exactly what Leary talks about
[03:41:38.460 --> 03:41:41.420]  at the end of his essay, Drugs and the Mind.
[03:41:41.420 --> 03:41:49.740]  He says that we're bringing about a shamanic initiation for the masses, but I don't think
[03:41:49.740 --> 03:41:55.620]  he's interested in a real flourishing of human experience and freedom.
[03:41:55.620 --> 03:42:01.340]  He's actually talking about fitting into the Brave New World scenario, and it's nothing
[03:42:01.340 --> 03:42:06.180]  new because the same oligarchs running this now are the same oligarchs 100 years ago,
[03:42:06.180 --> 03:42:11.900]  150 years ago, that were running drug lanes as described by Professor Anthony Sutton in
[03:42:11.900 --> 03:42:16.900]  his classic book, America's Secret Establishment, Order of Skull and Bones.
[03:42:16.900 --> 03:42:22.380]  The origin of the OSS and the CIA comes out of what, Skull and Bones, and what do these
[03:42:22.380 --> 03:42:23.380]  families do?
[03:42:23.380 --> 03:42:24.380]  How do they make their money?
[03:42:24.380 --> 03:42:29.220]  Oh, well, they were just really hardworking individuals who were very moral and pulled
[03:42:29.220 --> 03:42:30.500]  themselves up by their bootstraps.
[03:42:30.500 --> 03:42:32.900]  No, no, no, they'd run drugs.
[03:42:32.900 --> 03:42:35.460]  Did you not know that?
[03:42:35.460 --> 03:42:39.620]  You thought they just started Walmart and did all these things because they're good business
[03:42:39.620 --> 03:42:41.860]  people and they're very moral.
[03:42:41.860 --> 03:42:45.900]  No, they're evil.
[03:42:45.900 --> 03:42:47.980]  They take you to be dupes, you see.
[03:42:47.980 --> 03:42:49.460]  You the middle class are the dupes.
[03:42:49.460 --> 03:42:50.980]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:42:50.980 --> 03:42:51.980]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:42:51.980 --> 03:42:52.980]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer.
[03:42:55.800 --> 03:42:58.800]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[03:42:58.800 --> 03:43:01.800]  Please write this down and please go look this up.
[03:43:01.800 --> 03:43:03.800]  It will change your life.
[03:43:03.800 --> 03:43:06.800]  The UN admits and the Lansink Medical Journal admits
[03:43:06.800 --> 03:43:09.800]  that upwards of 2 billion people have mental disabilities
[03:43:09.800 --> 03:43:11.800]  and declining cognitive abilities.
[03:43:11.800 --> 03:43:14.800]  The term they use is intellectual disability
[03:43:14.800 --> 03:43:16.800]  because of lack of iodine.
[03:43:16.800 --> 03:43:20.800]  Most iodine in the environment is bound to other elements
[03:43:20.800 --> 03:43:22.800]  so your body can't absorb it.
[03:43:22.800 --> 03:43:27.800]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[03:43:27.800 --> 03:43:30.800]  And InfoWarsTore.com has the only iodine out there
[03:43:30.800 --> 03:43:34.800]  that actually has this type of full effect.
[03:43:34.800 --> 03:43:37.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3's been sold out for six months.
[03:43:37.800 --> 03:43:40.800]  It's very hard to produce and it's finally back in stock.
[03:43:40.800 --> 03:43:43.800]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[03:43:43.800 --> 03:43:45.800]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is powerful.
[03:43:45.800 --> 03:43:47.800]  You and your family need it.
[03:43:47.800 --> 03:43:49.800]  It's 25% off, back in stock.
[03:43:49.800 --> 03:43:53.800]  X3, try iodine exclusively at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:43:53.800 --> 03:43:56.800]  Take action now, but regardless, research is info.
[03:44:00.800 --> 03:44:02.800]  This is their big move.
[03:44:02.800 --> 03:44:03.800]  So, yeah, you say,
[03:44:03.800 --> 03:44:06.800]  why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States?
[03:44:06.800 --> 03:44:08.800]  He doesn't care.
[03:44:08.800 --> 03:44:09.800]  That's not his job.
[03:44:09.800 --> 03:44:11.800]  He's not the president of the United States.
[03:44:11.800 --> 03:44:14.800]  He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[03:44:14.800 --> 03:44:18.800]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased.
[03:44:18.800 --> 03:44:20.800]  They must be opposed.
[03:44:20.800 --> 03:44:23.800]  Autocrats only understand one word.
[03:44:23.800 --> 03:44:26.800]  No, no, no.
[03:44:26.800 --> 03:44:27.800]  Exactly.
[03:44:27.800 --> 03:44:30.800]  And that's why we say no to your vaccines.
[03:44:30.800 --> 03:44:34.800]  We say no to you shutting down our businesses.
[03:44:34.800 --> 03:44:36.800]  We say no to you taking our firearms.
[03:44:36.800 --> 03:44:39.800]  We say no to you censoring our free speech.
[03:44:39.800 --> 03:44:42.800]  We say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization.
[03:44:43.800 --> 03:44:45.800]  We say no to you getting us into World War III.
[03:44:45.800 --> 03:44:46.800]  You're right.
[03:44:46.800 --> 03:44:49.800]  We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden.
[03:44:49.800 --> 03:44:51.800]  And we say no.
[03:44:51.800 --> 03:44:53.800]  And we say no to your war.
[03:44:56.800 --> 03:44:58.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth,
[03:44:58.800 --> 03:45:00.800]  the solution is laying right there in front of you,
[03:45:00.800 --> 03:45:02.800]  hidden in plain view.
[03:45:02.800 --> 03:45:05.800]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[03:45:05.800 --> 03:45:06.800]  If you go to Wikipedia,
[03:45:06.800 --> 03:45:08.800]  it has links to the UN's own website
[03:45:08.800 --> 03:45:11.800]  where they admit the number one cause of cognitive disability
[03:45:11.800 --> 03:45:14.800]  in the world is iodine deficiency.
[03:45:14.800 --> 03:45:18.800]  The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability
[03:45:18.800 --> 03:45:22.800]  is lack of real, pure iodine in the body
[03:45:22.800 --> 03:45:24.800]  as they bomb us with the bad halogens,
[03:45:24.800 --> 03:45:27.800]  bromine, bromide, chlorine, and so much more.
[03:45:27.800 --> 03:45:31.800]  Upwards of 2 billion people in a Lancet Medical Journal study
[03:45:31.800 --> 03:45:35.800]  in 2007 worldwide have cognitive disabilities
[03:45:35.800 --> 03:45:38.800]  because they don't have high-quality iodine.
[03:45:38.800 --> 03:45:40.800]  Most iodine is bound to other elements you don't absorb it.
[03:45:40.800 --> 03:45:43.800]  We have X3, all three types of the good iodine,
[03:45:43.800 --> 03:45:46.800]  together that supercharges your body.
[03:45:46.800 --> 03:45:49.800]  X3 is now back in stock at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:45:49.800 --> 03:45:52.800]  It's been sold out for over six months for 25% off.
[03:45:52.800 --> 03:45:53.800]  X3, back in stock.
[03:45:53.800 --> 03:45:54.800]  Take action now.
[03:45:54.800 --> 03:45:56.800]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:45:56.800 --> 03:46:01.800]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on Earth.
[03:46:01.800 --> 03:46:04.800]  And they've got our children drinking that.
[03:46:04.800 --> 03:46:08.800]  This is a psychotic death cult, period, case closed,
[03:46:08.800 --> 03:46:10.800]  out to get you and your family.
[03:46:10.800 --> 03:46:12.800]  We sell the Alexa Pure Breeze
[03:46:12.800 --> 03:46:15.800]  made by the MyPatriotSupply Ready Hour group.
[03:46:15.800 --> 03:46:16.800]  It's been around about 15 years,
[03:46:16.800 --> 03:46:18.800]  became the biggest company in the last six.
[03:46:18.800 --> 03:46:20.800]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered
[03:46:20.800 --> 03:46:23.800]  the fancy best water filter system out there
[03:46:23.800 --> 03:46:24.800]  that sells for twice the price,
[03:46:24.800 --> 03:46:28.800]  and they made it as good in all the studies.
[03:46:28.800 --> 03:46:30.800]  It reduces things to non-detectable levels,
[03:46:30.800 --> 03:46:31.800]  thousands of chemicals.
[03:46:31.800 --> 03:46:32.800]  But you can go pay two or three times.
[03:46:32.800 --> 03:46:34.800]  There's four or five other filters out there
[03:46:34.800 --> 03:46:35.800]  that are just as good.
[03:46:35.800 --> 03:46:38.800]  We sell the very best highest grade water filtration system
[03:46:38.800 --> 03:46:40.800]  for half the price to a leading competitor.
[03:46:40.800 --> 03:46:44.800]  And the media says we're bad and a cult
[03:46:44.800 --> 03:46:46.800]  for telling you you should filter your water.
[03:46:46.800 --> 03:46:47.800]  You should also filter your shower water.
[03:46:47.800 --> 03:46:49.800]  That's another way you absorb this crap.
[03:46:49.800 --> 03:46:50.800]  But I'm done talking about that.
[03:46:50.800 --> 03:46:53.800]  The point is you can get the filters at infowarsstore.com.
[03:46:53.800 --> 03:46:54.800]  They're discounted right now.
[03:46:54.800 --> 03:46:56.800]  Finally back in stock.
[03:46:56.800 --> 03:47:01.800]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[03:47:01.800 --> 03:47:03.800]  it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:05.100 --> 03:47:14.860]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show, I'm your guest host Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[03:47:14.860 --> 03:47:19.940]  We're talking about pharmacological means of control, and I want to remind you, if you
[03:47:19.940 --> 03:47:24.060]  head on over to my Twitter right now, I'll just type in Jay Dyer on Twitter, and you'll
[03:47:24.060 --> 03:47:28.860]  see me, I'll pop up, there's live events, I want you to come to my live events.
[03:47:28.860 --> 03:47:34.920]  We'll be in Los Angeles live, July the 6th, and if you go to my Twitter, you'll see they're
[03:47:34.920 --> 03:47:38.800]  up there at the top, there's the event right there.
[03:47:38.800 --> 03:47:43.080]  We'll be live with some famous people, it's going to be a lot of fun.
[03:47:43.080 --> 03:47:46.600]  It's a five-hour event, so our events are not like most people's events.
[03:47:46.600 --> 03:47:51.360]  We did an event a few weeks ago, or actually a month or two ago, when I was in Austin down
[03:47:51.360 --> 03:47:55.200]  there with Alex, when we did a few in-studio interviews with Alex, so I got a lot of traction,
[03:47:55.200 --> 03:47:56.200]  it was a lot of fun.
[03:47:56.200 --> 03:48:00.320]  We also did a live event, there's my Tucker special, if you didn't see the Tucker special,
[03:48:00.320 --> 03:48:04.520]  it's actually in Austin where I'm running around, getting the Austinites to eat bugs
[03:48:04.520 --> 03:48:05.520]  there.
[03:48:05.520 --> 03:48:12.280]  So, hopefully I didn't get Tucker fired, sorry if I did, my bad guys, oops, my bad, it might
[03:48:12.280 --> 03:48:16.720]  have been the, Klaus made a few phone calls, get rid of the Tucker, this was the final
[03:48:16.720 --> 03:48:20.080]  straw, I want him gone.
[03:48:20.080 --> 03:48:29.000]  So my Klaus skit might have been the end of Tucker, sorry about that, my bad everybody.
[03:48:29.000 --> 03:48:33.440]  Also live event, Nashville, we'll be live in Nashville at a big event, Owen Schroer,
[03:48:33.440 --> 03:48:38.120]  you might have heard of him, you guys heard of him, you know who he is, June 3rd and 4th,
[03:48:38.120 --> 03:48:43.800]  if you go to my Twitter you'll also see that a few down, that is the Rebels for Cause event,
[03:48:43.800 --> 03:48:50.680]  so there's that event, and then there's also this event with Owen and a host of people
[03:48:50.680 --> 03:48:59.040]  over in Nashville, Mel K, Ryan Christine, Scott Armstrong, Matt Baker will be there,
[03:48:59.040 --> 03:49:03.040]  tons and tons of people, a two day event, so go get your tickets to that Rebels for
[03:49:03.040 --> 03:49:08.680]  Cause event outside Nashville, June 3rd and 4th, so get those tickets, it's gonna be a
[03:49:08.680 --> 03:49:11.960]  lot of fun, yeah that's it.
[03:49:11.960 --> 03:49:15.800]  Should be a big event, again Owen will be there, as well as a bunch of other really
[03:49:15.800 --> 03:49:22.120]  cool Bay's Red Pill people, so we're talking about the drug lanes, drug networks, America's
[03:49:22.120 --> 03:49:28.320]  secret establishment, this classic text from Professor Anthony Sutton, and we've been covering
[03:49:28.320 --> 03:49:33.200]  a lot of Anthony Sutton books lately, I stumbled upon one that I didn't know about which he
[03:49:33.200 --> 03:49:37.800]  wrote with Patrick Wood, I know Alex has had Patrick Wood on many times, but this is actually
[03:49:37.800 --> 03:49:41.980]  written in the 70s, and so I'm really enjoying this text, and it relates to all this too
[03:49:41.980 --> 03:49:45.680]  because we start to see that it's really the same power structure that's kind of been there
[03:49:45.680 --> 03:49:48.960]  this oligarchy that's been there for a long time, particularly the last hundred years
[03:49:48.960 --> 03:49:54.840]  or so in America, the American oligarchical power structure, which is the same power structure
[03:49:54.840 --> 03:49:59.380]  described by a lot of the elite texts, Dr. Carol Quigley and others, and I want to remind
[03:49:59.380 --> 03:50:07.800]  you guys too that I've lectured through 60-ish of these texts, and I've got more, I got more
[03:50:07.800 --> 03:50:15.200]  in the mail, good news, just got this classic, so years before Edward Bernays wrote Propaganda
[03:50:15.200 --> 03:50:19.400]  Walter Lippmann wrote Public Opinion, so we'll be covering this one in the next few
[03:50:19.400 --> 03:50:25.120]  weeks, it's going to be a lot of fun, and I've enjoyed reading all these other Huxley
[03:50:25.120 --> 03:50:31.880]  books, Huxter books, Aldous Huxter books, Aldous Huxley that I'd never read before because
[03:50:31.880 --> 03:50:36.240]  there's a lot of insights, everybody knows about kind of the famous books of Orwell or
[03:50:36.240 --> 03:50:40.040]  Huxley, but it turns out that a lot of times they have these other lesser-known books
[03:50:40.040 --> 03:50:44.680]  and essays and writings that give you a lot of nuggets, a lot of gems, a lot of insights
[03:50:44.680 --> 03:50:48.600]  into what else they were up to and what was really going on, and I was mentioning, you
[03:50:48.600 --> 03:50:54.520]  know, covering John C. Lilly's books, covering Terrence McKenna's books, the Psychonauts,
[03:50:54.520 --> 03:50:58.920]  the Psychonauts are really important because although they weren't necessarily running the
[03:50:58.920 --> 03:51:03.160]  whole New World Order, they were really the visionaries that were playing out and planning
[03:51:03.160 --> 03:51:09.000]  out and experimenting with future means of control, and one of those visionaries far
[03:51:09.000 --> 03:51:15.760]  prior to Huxley or any of these, as we said, and H.G. Wells was talking about the future
[03:51:15.760 --> 03:51:20.760]  world religion in the 1890s. He wrote a book, God, the Invisible King, where he said that
[03:51:20.760 --> 03:51:30.040]  the future world religion will be a New Age kind of Luciferian religion, and in my view,
[03:51:30.040 --> 03:51:34.160]  the British imperial superstructure, that inner core, the shadow government of the British
[03:51:34.240 --> 03:51:40.240]  empire, the Milner-Fabian circles, they were actually running and controlling the Theosophy
[03:51:40.240 --> 03:51:47.600]  Society, and so Theosophy, with its promotion of Bolshevism, its promotion of Soviet and
[03:51:47.600 --> 03:51:53.920]  communist government, that was being foisted by the Milner-Fabian Society, and I think
[03:51:53.920 --> 03:51:58.960]  that Madame Blavatsky, one of these kind of, you know, predecessors to the New Age, you
[03:51:59.040 --> 03:52:04.080]  know, almost 70, 80 years before the New Age movement actually becomes a full-on thing in
[03:52:04.080 --> 03:52:10.480]  the 1960s. This was being planned out by the Fabian Socialists and the Tavistock Institute,
[03:52:10.480 --> 03:52:15.280]  and so again, we've covered this book, this 500-page classic text on the history of that
[03:52:15.280 --> 03:52:19.680]  conspiracy, which is a real geopolitical power structure. It is the Anglo-American
[03:52:19.680 --> 03:52:23.840]  establishment. That's who we're talking about here. That's the same as this. They're the same.
[03:52:24.800 --> 03:52:30.160]  So you're saying these are not conspiracy books. These are actual historians and professors,
[03:52:31.120 --> 03:52:36.640]  and this was also written by Professor Anthony Sutton as well, explaining this power structure
[03:52:36.640 --> 03:52:43.600]  in detail, and Hoxha is really just one of these figures that is an arm of this power structure,
[03:52:43.600 --> 03:52:49.040]  one of these people in these circles, and so his writings are crucial, instrumental to
[03:52:49.040 --> 03:52:53.440]  understanding how this control structure works and how it rolls these things out over time.
[03:52:54.720 --> 03:52:59.920]  And so, you know, when we cover Brave New World in depth, we saw that he wasn't just writing
[03:52:59.920 --> 03:53:06.560]  something that was a theory or a fiction. It was a plan that would be rolled out,
[03:53:08.480 --> 03:53:12.720]  and I want to say, too, that if you want a deeper analysis of that, I will be covering that in
[03:53:12.720 --> 03:53:19.040]  detail this week on my channel, on my members section. We're going to be covering Heaven
[03:53:19.840 --> 03:53:24.640]  and Hell, the essay that's the second half of this book, The Doors of Perception. We'll be doing
[03:53:24.640 --> 03:53:29.680]  that tonight, but the psychonauts are crucial. The psychonauts are a big part of this. I hope
[03:53:29.680 --> 03:53:36.160]  you understand that, but ultimately, all of this is about total control, so it's not a bunch of
[03:53:36.160 --> 03:53:42.480]  different conspiracies. There's only one conspiracy, and it's really just world domination and world
[03:53:42.480 --> 03:53:48.560]  power. That's it, and a big part of that, as we said, is more than just culture. It's energy
[03:53:48.560 --> 03:53:54.400]  control. Energy control via, you know, the bringing in of the technocracy, energy control
[03:53:54.400 --> 03:54:00.880]  by banning cars, banning stoves, energy control via controlling you because you are a being that
[03:54:00.880 --> 03:54:07.680]  uses energy, and so controlling population is not just controlling the numbers of the population.
[03:54:07.680 --> 03:54:14.480]  It's controlling you on a day-to-day constant basis. The 15-minute cities, the ESG regulations
[03:54:14.480 --> 03:54:19.760]  and control mechanisms. I noticed I was looking at plane tickets the other day, and now there's
[03:54:19.760 --> 03:54:26.960]  these alerts about which airlines have more CO2 emissions. This is ridiculous. This is all control
[03:54:26.960 --> 03:54:32.640]  and social engineering, nothing to do with the environment. It's 100% totally to control you,
[03:54:33.520 --> 03:54:39.840]  and that's what banning meat is. The vegan movement is part of this. The Wildlands Project,
[03:54:39.840 --> 03:54:46.960]  the UN Biodiversity Project. Now you can begin to see why, and anti-family movements, you see.
[03:54:46.960 --> 03:54:53.840]  Now you can begin to see why anti-natalism. This actually fits in with that apocalyptic
[03:54:53.840 --> 03:55:01.600]  human sacrifice religion. They've just taken the human sacrifice religion of the Mayans
[03:55:01.600 --> 03:55:08.800]  via Apocalypto, turned that into a new earth religion, and a new world religion based around
[03:55:08.800 --> 03:55:12.720]  worshiping the earth, which by the way, there was articles in the news last week about this.
[03:55:12.720 --> 03:55:17.200]  Earth Time Magazine, Earth Day needs to be a new religious holiday for the world,
[03:55:19.040 --> 03:55:27.680]  and that's about Agenda 21. Go back to the Bush-Rio Treaty, Agenda 2030, etc.
[03:55:28.640 --> 03:55:33.680]  All of this is the same agenda, the austerity agenda, the IMF austerity agenda.
[03:55:35.040 --> 03:55:42.160]  It's this, it's the same stuff, you understand. And so the drug culture contributes to the
[03:55:42.880 --> 03:55:50.640]  social revolution because they think they're the tip of the spear, as Jacques Attali calls them
[03:55:50.640 --> 03:55:54.640]  in his book, Brief History of the Future. They think they're the tip of the sphere for
[03:55:55.040 --> 03:55:59.760]  making a better society, when they're actually the tip of the sphere for the final revolution
[03:55:59.760 --> 03:56:05.040]  of the enslavement of humanity and the transcending of humanity through transhumanism,
[03:56:05.040 --> 03:56:09.200]  as the Huxleys themselves write in their books.
[03:56:09.900 --> 03:56:20.260]  The cleansing of the doors of perception is really just mass mind control.
[03:56:20.260 --> 03:56:24.460]  I'm not saying that everybody that's had a drug experience is mind control, I'm not saying
[03:56:24.460 --> 03:56:25.460]  that.
[03:56:25.460 --> 03:56:31.020]  I'm saying that the overall strategy of this being let loose on the population, not even
[03:56:31.020 --> 03:56:33.660]  through the 60s counterculture, but through big pharma.
[03:56:33.700 --> 03:56:47.220]  That is ultimately to control everyone, corporate dominance, corporate mind control, and Huxley
[03:56:47.220 --> 03:56:51.480]  is ultimately serving that agenda, and that's what Brave New World is about, that's what
[03:56:51.480 --> 03:56:53.300]  Doors of Perception is ultimately talking about.
[03:56:53.300 --> 03:57:00.980]  It's about controlling you, controlling energy, controlling everything, reducing population,
[03:57:00.980 --> 03:57:05.779]  remember the Georgia Guidestones, vastly reducing it down.
[03:57:05.779 --> 03:57:11.380]  Even Putin has been talking about the golden billion, have you heard of this?
[03:57:11.380 --> 03:57:15.699]  Reducing the population down to first a billion and then they want to get it down to 500 million
[03:57:15.699 --> 03:57:17.660]  and then they want to get it down to even smaller, you see.
[03:57:18.700 --> 03:57:20.700]  That is what all of this is about.
[03:57:20.700 --> 03:57:22.700]  It's in its one single agenda.
[03:57:22.700 --> 03:57:26.700]  And all of these people write about that single agenda in their books.
[03:57:26.700 --> 03:57:28.700]  And I cover that over on my channel.
[03:57:28.700 --> 03:57:30.700]  Head on over to the Infantware store.
[03:57:30.700 --> 03:57:33.700]  Support the tip of the spear when it comes to fighting this Infantware.
[03:57:33.700 --> 03:57:36.700]  Go to the Infantware store and support Alex by getting those products.
[03:57:36.700 --> 03:57:39.700]  And also go to my website and get my books in the shop right there.
[03:57:39.700 --> 03:57:40.700]  See that? You can go to the shop.
[03:57:40.700 --> 03:57:43.700]  And then we'll be covering Mel Gibson movies tonight on my channel.
[03:57:43.700 --> 03:57:45.700]  Come watch that tonight.
[03:57:46.700 --> 03:57:47.700]  Turbo Force is back.
[03:57:47.700 --> 03:57:49.700]  Sold out for eight months.
[03:57:49.700 --> 03:57:51.700]  And it's Turbo Force Plus.
[03:57:51.700 --> 03:57:53.700]  We made it even stronger.
[03:57:53.700 --> 03:57:57.700]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[03:57:57.700 --> 03:58:04.700]  Turbo Force is back in stock at Infantwarestore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:58:04.700 --> 03:58:10.700]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[03:58:10.700 --> 03:58:12.700]  Should be called 10-hour energy.
[03:58:12.700 --> 03:58:17.700]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids
[03:58:17.700 --> 03:58:23.700]  that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[03:58:25.700 --> 03:58:27.700]  It is the super fuel.
[03:58:27.700 --> 03:58:29.700]  Brain Force Plus is great.
[03:58:29.700 --> 03:58:30.700]  Brain Force Ultra is great.
[03:58:30.700 --> 03:58:31.700]  There are two different nootropics.
[03:58:31.700 --> 03:58:32.700]  They go good with this.
[03:58:32.700 --> 03:58:34.700]  But this is the King Kong.
[03:58:34.700 --> 03:58:36.700]  This is the boss.
[03:58:36.700 --> 03:58:40.700]  Turbo Force, back in stock, discounted, Infantwarestore.com.
[03:58:40.700 --> 03:58:43.700]  More power, more strength, more energy.
[03:58:46.700 --> 03:58:50.700]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government.
[03:58:50.700 --> 03:58:54.700]  A flying disk has been found and is now in the possession of the Army.
[03:58:54.700 --> 03:58:56.700]  There is a bulletin from CBS News.
[03:58:56.700 --> 03:58:58.700]  President Kennedy has been shot.
[03:58:58.700 --> 03:59:02.700]  This is a different kind of war.
[03:59:02.700 --> 03:59:06.700]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and torpedoes.
[03:59:06.700 --> 03:59:10.700]  The CIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[03:59:10.700 --> 03:59:14.700]  They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[03:59:14.700 --> 03:59:16.700]  It was almost as if there were a plan in place.
[03:59:16.700 --> 03:59:18.700]  It just can't happen.
[03:59:18.700 --> 03:59:20.700]  We need to go into the capital.
[03:59:20.700 --> 03:59:22.700]  Death, death, death.
[03:59:22.700 --> 03:59:24.700]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[03:59:24.700 --> 03:59:26.700]  They are nothing but distractions.
[03:59:26.700 --> 03:59:28.700]  You guys censored Harvard educated doctors.
[03:59:28.700 --> 03:59:30.700]  You silenced those voices.
[03:59:30.700 --> 03:59:34.700]  What we want to do in Davos is push the reset button.
[03:59:34.700 --> 03:59:37.700]  As soon as we start exposing the great reset,
[03:59:37.700 --> 03:59:41.700]  the sooner these globalists start going to prison.
[03:59:49.700 --> 03:59:54.700]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
