[00:00:16.633 --> 00:00:20.758]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:41.415 --> 00:00:44.418]  It's Friday, May 5th, 2023.
[00:00:44.418 --> 00:00:50.823]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[00:00:50.823 --> 00:00:58.270]  All right, we have another gigantic, incredibly informative, revolutionary transmission lined up for you today.
[00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.012]  And Lord willing, I'll be back Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:01:01.012 --> 00:01:04.375]  with the Sunday Night Show, and right after that, Sunday Live, 6 to 8 p.m.
[00:01:04.375 --> 00:01:05.476]  with Owen Schroeder.
[00:01:05.476 --> 00:01:07.398]  I'm here weekdays, 11 a.m.
[00:01:07.398 --> 00:01:08.078]  to 3 p.m.
[00:01:08.078 --> 00:01:08.439]  Central.
[00:01:09.321 --> 00:01:13.390]  And I come on right after the great Harrison Smith, weekday mornings, 8 a.m.
[00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:14.613]  to 11 a.m.
[00:01:14.613 --> 00:01:15.535]  American Journal.
[00:01:16.474 --> 00:01:20.936]  Okay, we have another ultra-massive transmission lined up for you.
[00:01:20.936 --> 00:01:34.702]  Coming up in 30 minutes, Norm Pattis, another one of the lawyers from the Proud Boys show trial, one of many in D.C., four men being given the terrorism conviction for doing absolutely nothing.
[00:01:34.702 --> 00:01:38.323]  The feds had zero evidence, but they have kept controlled juries.
[00:01:38.323 --> 00:01:39.404]  They're in the District of Satan.
[00:01:40.788 --> 00:01:47.310]  And finally, the lawyers will be able to tell you what really went on behind the scenes.
[00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.011]  Lawyers will be able to tell you what really went on behind the scenes.
[00:01:51.011 --> 00:01:59.494]  A lot of just incredible criminal activity, total proof of the Feds orchestrating the actual break-in, the judge suppressing all of that.
[00:01:59.494 --> 00:02:06.676]  You will get that information coming up at the bottom of the hour, in T-minus 27 minutes or so.
[00:02:08.991 --> 00:02:14.516]  J6 political prisoners, attorneys, evidence confirms J6 was an organized government plot.
[00:02:14.516 --> 00:02:17.959]  There is no evidence of conspiracy by the Patriots.
[00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.722]  We'll be going over that coming up, as I said.
[00:02:20.722 --> 00:02:33.793]  And here's a quick clip back from January that the media has now pushed again of Trump saying if he's re-elected as president in 2024, he will pardon the J6ers.
[00:02:33.793 --> 00:02:34.174]  Here it is.
[00:02:35.518 --> 00:02:46.765]  And another thing we'll do, and so many people have been asking me about it, if I run, and if I win, we will treat those people from January 6th fairly.
[00:02:46.765 --> 00:02:49.246]  We will treat them fairly.
[00:02:49.246 --> 00:02:58.852]  And if it requires pardons, we will give them pardons, because they are being treated so unfairly.
[00:02:58.852 --> 00:03:01.754]  Meanwhile, JFK Jr., RFK Jr.,
[00:03:06.525 --> 00:03:12.449]  Has come out and said that he would pardon Assange and Snowden.
[00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:16.691]  That is something that Trump should have done that Trump didn't do.
[00:03:16.691 --> 00:03:19.373]  And I'm sorry if I'm bumbling a little bit here at the start of the show today.
[00:03:19.373 --> 00:03:22.435]  I got particularly ready for this show.
[00:03:23.684 --> 00:03:32.490]  And sometimes when I really do a ton of research, there's so much going on in my mind that it's just hard for me to even try to collate it all, much less cover it all.
[00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.972]  We're doing the best job we can today.
[00:03:34.972 --> 00:03:39.335]  Former CIA officer says decision to drone attack criminal was made by the United States.
[00:03:39.335 --> 00:03:40.155]  I totally agree with that.
[00:03:40.155 --> 00:03:42.237]  And of course, there's a lot of evidence that shows that.
[00:03:42.237 --> 00:03:45.959]  We'll get into that stack and the incredible escalations there.
[00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.622]  Who declares end to COVID global public health emergency?
[00:03:50.686 --> 00:04:01.654]  Also, mental strain, marijuana may be behind a 30% increase in schizophrenia in young men, major NIH funded studies suggest.
[00:04:01.654 --> 00:04:04.856]  Well, I don't need studies to know that's true.
[00:04:04.856 --> 00:04:11.040]  I am not for marijuana criminalization, but I am for decriminalization.
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.143]  I'm not for total legalization, but I have known so many people
[00:04:16.158 --> 00:04:23.684]  That became intense potheads and with the new weed that's so strong, they became outright schizophrenics.
[00:04:23.684 --> 00:04:30.750]  Two people that worked here, I guess synergistically smoked tons of pot together all day.
[00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.913]  And I knew both of them, one of them for like 14 years, the other for about six years.
[00:04:34.913 --> 00:04:36.074]  And they both went insane.
[00:04:37.853 --> 00:04:40.414]  I mean, just totally insane for the marijuana.
[00:04:40.414 --> 00:04:42.535]  I've got so many other friends and others it's happened to.
[00:04:42.535 --> 00:04:46.796]  Joe Rogan's talked about all his friends that have gone completely schizophrenic on marijuana.
[00:04:46.796 --> 00:04:50.797]  It is a chemical weapon now, basically, and it's so damn dangerous.
[00:04:50.797 --> 00:04:53.618]  But nothing compared to fentanyl.
[00:04:53.618 --> 00:04:54.479]  Oh, wait till you hear that news.
[00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:55.379]  A 279% increase in deaths from fentanyl.
[00:05:00.725 --> 00:05:03.307]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[00:05:03.307 --> 00:05:05.568]  Please write this down and please go look this up.
[00:05:05.568 --> 00:05:07.549]  It will change your life.
[00:05:07.549 --> 00:05:16.315]  The UN admits and the Lansing Medical Journal admits that upwards of 2 billion people have mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities.
[00:05:16.315 --> 00:05:21.639]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:23.120]  Most iodine in the environment
[00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.361]  Is bound to other elements so your body can't absorb it.
[00:05:27.361 --> 00:05:31.823]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[00:05:31.823 --> 00:05:38.905]  And InfoWarStore.com has the only iodine out there that actually has this type of full effect.
[00:05:38.905 --> 00:05:44.907]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3's been sold out for six months, it's very hard to produce, and it's finally back in stock.
[00:05:45.487 --> 00:05:47.849]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:50.090]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is powerful.
[00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:51.891]  You and your family need it.
[00:05:51.891 --> 00:05:53.652]  It's 25% off back in stock.
[00:05:53.652 --> 00:05:55.514]  X3 Tri-Iodine.
[00:05:55.514 --> 00:05:57.855]  Exclusively at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:05:57.855 --> 00:06:00.337]  Take action now, but regardless, research is info.
[00:06:13.609 --> 00:06:14.631]  Big Brother.
[00:06:14.631 --> 00:06:16.434]  Mainstream media.
[00:06:16.434 --> 00:06:18.357]  Government cover-ups.
[00:06:18.357 --> 00:06:20.040]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.703]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:21.703 --> 00:06:26.371]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:30.942 --> 00:06:42.234]  Man, we've always got a lot of incredibly important news to cover, but today it is particularly jam-packed and, quite frankly, horrifying, invigorating, amazing, disgusting.
[00:06:42.234 --> 00:06:44.657]  All points of the compass are covered here.
[00:06:44.657 --> 00:06:46.338]  But I gotta say something.
[00:06:46.338 --> 00:06:50.423]  I've known for a long time that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:06:50.423 --> 00:06:51.704]  has been a listener of the show.
[00:06:51.704 --> 00:06:52.465]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:06:53.942 --> 00:07:04.111]  We have the same book publisher as well, but he said they would use it too much against him politically and spinning things if he did come on the show and I fully understand that.
[00:07:04.111 --> 00:07:19.805]  The reason I'm getting more and more behind him is he came out and said the whole global warming system is a scam by mega banks and the ultra-rich like Bill Gates to take over all of civilization and transfer all wealth to themselves and enslave us.
[00:07:21.584 --> 00:07:28.107]  Now he comes out and says that the globalists are destroying our borders to collapse the United States and bring in slave labor.
[00:07:28.107 --> 00:07:36.772]  He went on to say that he's not anti-immigrant, he's anti-illegal immigration and collapsing the country.
[00:07:36.772 --> 00:07:39.993]  I mean, he just is awesome.
[00:07:39.993 --> 00:07:41.074]  He knows what's going on.
[00:07:42.301 --> 00:07:44.703]  Very, very powerful.
[00:07:44.703 --> 00:07:51.428]  Meanwhile, new footage shows El Paso engulfed in mass migration dumpster fire, a state of emergency declared.
[00:07:51.428 --> 00:07:56.031]  A lot of people have asked, why have we been down to the border in the last year?
[00:07:56.031 --> 00:07:59.254]  Well, Owen Schroeder's not allowed to leave Austin.
[00:07:59.254 --> 00:08:08.761]  And his pre-sentencing, pre-trial probation officer from January 6th won't let him leave Austin.
[00:08:09.594 --> 00:08:17.001]  They let him leave a couple times a year to go back to Kansas City to see his mom and dad.
[00:08:17.001 --> 00:08:19.164]  And again, Owen was outside the Capitol.
[00:08:19.164 --> 00:08:24.369]  Owen tried to get people to not go in the Capitol, and he's still facing years in prison.
[00:08:24.369 --> 00:08:29.174]  You just saw the setup of the Proud Boys, who in my estimation did absolutely nothing.
[00:08:30.706 --> 00:08:31.827]  Certainly nothing compared to the left.
[00:08:31.827 --> 00:08:37.272]  They're now facing 20 plus years in prison with all the charges, something like 35 years in prison.
[00:08:37.272 --> 00:08:46.900]  We've got their lawyers coming on and joining us with the inside baseball of what the feds covered up and the total evidence of the feds being the ones that orchestrated the attack on the Capitol.
[00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:50.623]  That's in about 20 minutes with Norm Patus and others.
[00:08:50.623 --> 00:08:51.984]  So look for that.
[00:08:51.984 --> 00:08:56.909]  We're going to be looking at the incredible footage as Title 42 is about to elapse.
[00:08:58.066 --> 00:09:02.969]  Members of Congress have introduced an emergency Title 42 alternative.
[00:09:02.969 --> 00:09:03.929]  It's all part of the U.N.
[00:09:03.929 --> 00:09:06.311]  replacement migration operation.
[00:09:06.311 --> 00:09:10.373]  Biden's now acting like he didn't say immediately surge the border.
[00:09:10.373 --> 00:09:14.775]  Biden is now acting like he wants to save us from the collapsed border.
[00:09:14.775 --> 00:09:16.897]  This is just insane.
[00:09:16.897 --> 00:09:24.381]  And the clown that is the White House press secretary said, this is an administration that has taken challenges to the border very seriously since day one.
[00:09:26.132 --> 00:09:30.634]  Mike Pence tells Fox News a storm is coming one week from today.
[00:09:30.634 --> 00:09:33.835]  That was a few days ago, so it is incredible.
[00:09:33.835 --> 00:09:40.737]  There's hundreds of thousands waiting to get in just at the El Paso crossing alone.
[00:09:40.737 --> 00:09:48.200]  Upwards of 50,000, we're told, by the Border Patrol in the McAllen area and just millions more on their way.
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:52.742]  This is beyond dangerous, but we will be going back to the border very, very soon.
[00:09:52.742 --> 00:09:55.283]  I will be going back down to the border.
[00:09:56.744 --> 00:09:58.185]  And I will be covering what's going on.
[00:09:58.185 --> 00:10:04.068]  We're also going to get Drew Hernandez to go with us down there as well and others.
[00:10:04.068 --> 00:10:05.989]  But they're not hiding anymore.
[00:10:05.989 --> 00:10:06.529]  We were down there.
[00:10:07.915 --> 00:10:16.102]  Fifteen years ago, ten years ago, five years ago, and a whole bunch the last two years, two, three years, it was not getting covered by the national news.
[00:10:16.102 --> 00:10:23.829]  Now they're like, oh there's this giant problem, gee, we need more funding to then process and bring the illegals in and fly them around the country.
[00:10:23.829 --> 00:10:34.179]  The reason they're putting troops on the border is there's so many tens of thousands a day per checkpoint that there's no one to load them on the buses, no one to load them on the planes, no one to load them up with all their free gift cards and
[00:10:35.667 --> 00:10:36.848]  We're good to go.
[00:10:56.716 --> 00:11:01.798]  Only 41 of them, or 42 of them, got shipped there one time and it was a national emergency.
[00:11:01.798 --> 00:11:03.258]  The rich billionaire globalist.
[00:11:03.258 --> 00:11:05.159]  Why Barack Obama's house is there.
[00:11:05.159 --> 00:11:10.821]  You can't have 41, or what is it, 42 of these people wandering around aimlessly.
[00:11:10.821 --> 00:11:12.682]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:11:12.682 --> 00:11:15.763]  They kicked them out of the town and called it humanitarian.
[00:11:15.763 --> 00:11:20.405]  Yeah, not in, not in your backyard, right?
[00:11:20.405 --> 00:11:23.006]  We've got all that news.
[00:11:23.006 --> 00:11:25.427]  We've got the insanely important news.
[00:11:26.562 --> 00:11:37.024]  As things have escalated exactly as I said they would, and I'm not bragging, I just show I do my research and when I talk about something geopolitically, I know what I'm talking about.
[00:11:37.024 --> 00:11:46.386]  Or if it's an area I don't know, I'll go research it and tell you I have to reserve comment until I've had time to research it, but I know exactly what's going on in Russia and Ukraine.
[00:11:46.386 --> 00:11:52.447]  And I told you that they would invade in late February, in October the year before, just a few months before.
[00:11:53.689 --> 00:11:58.774]  And I told you that they were going to start launching more drone attacks inside Russia as a provocation.
[00:11:58.774 --> 00:12:00.837]  They would then claim that it was Russia doing it to itself.
[00:12:00.837 --> 00:12:04.220]  That is exactly what the State Department has now done.
[00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:15.832]  And former top intelligence case officer, analyst, so much more, Larry Johnson has come out and basically word for word said what I said about that situation.
[00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:19.656]  The reason that's important is it's not about saying, oh look, I was right.
[00:12:19.656 --> 00:12:22.200]  It's not just him, it's a bunch of other experts saying the same thing.
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:27.450]  It's that I'm going to tell you what I believe is about to come next, so that is next segment.
[00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:27.790]  Also...
[00:12:30.342 --> 00:12:37.528]  I want to open the phones up in the second and third hour today, and I want to have a quiz on several topics.
[00:12:37.528 --> 00:12:45.235]  We haven't done this in probably a decade on the show, but I want to bring back quizzes for people, and see who can answer the question right.
[00:12:45.235 --> 00:12:53.241]  And whoever does answer the question right, give us your address, and we'll mail you one of our new t-shirts in the size that you request as a prize.
[00:12:54.241 --> 00:12:56.662]  We're going to start doing this I think every day when we take calls.
[00:12:56.662 --> 00:12:58.263]  Sometimes we'll have multiple prizes.
[00:12:58.263 --> 00:12:59.564]  Dozens of prizes.
[00:12:59.564 --> 00:13:02.765]  But today we're just going to give out one t-shirt on this question.
[00:13:02.765 --> 00:13:12.210]  So we'll go ahead and throw the question out now and I'll repose the question next hour and then it'll be very informative when we get the answer.
[00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:16.653]  WHO declares an end to COVID global public health emergency.
[00:13:16.653 --> 00:13:21.275]  The question is why are they doing that?
[00:13:21.275 --> 00:13:22.856]  I told my wife about a month ago
[00:13:24.369 --> 00:13:28.670]  That when you see this, this is what this is going to mean.
[00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:32.071]  So this morning, I hadn't seen the story.
[00:13:32.071 --> 00:13:35.052]  I'd missed it somehow, even though I was getting ready for the news.
[00:13:35.052 --> 00:13:40.714]  She got up a little bit earlier than she normally does, about 7 a.m., and said, have you seen this?
[00:13:40.714 --> 00:13:41.514]  And I said, yes.
[00:13:41.514 --> 00:13:45.955]  So what does that mean?
[00:13:45.955 --> 00:13:49.576]  In my opinion, is this cause for celebration?
[00:13:49.576 --> 00:13:50.937]  Or what does this really mean?
[00:13:52.990 --> 00:14:05.633]  So obviously we'll just take calls until somebody gets the answer and I'll get the toll free number out at the end of this hour when Norm Pattis and one of the other proud boy attorneys that's joining us leave us.
[00:14:05.633 --> 00:14:19.557]  It's going to be Norm Pattis and Steve Metcalf and this really is going to be a big interview because obviously I've known what's going on the whole time during the trial and before the trial because I know some of the lawyers
[00:14:20.695 --> 00:14:29.478]  And I was not at liberty to tell you what was going on because that would give up the sources and you can't do that during a trial.
[00:14:29.478 --> 00:14:39.302]  I was able to bring out the fact that feds were involved and that they were provocateur in the operation but now you're gonna get to learn what really went on.
[00:14:39.302 --> 00:14:41.823]  We can talk about how it wasn't a fair trial all day and that's true.
[00:14:41.823 --> 00:14:45.444]  Now it sets the precedent for this to be the model around the country to put people in prison.
[00:14:46.764 --> 00:15:02.897]  And we've got lots of different organizations, like the PETA project, I'm sorry, that's the Lincoln Project, coming out and calling for my arrest after this, and Roger Stone's arrest.
[00:15:02.897 --> 00:15:08.141]  And the guy actually says that I am guilty, that I ran the attack.
[00:15:08.141 --> 00:15:15.007]  I don't have the money and time to sue people like this, but it's just, it's preposterous.
[00:15:16.328 --> 00:15:19.010]  I almost went back to the hotel because my wife was freezing.
[00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:22.012]  I didn't want to lead the crowd to the Capitol.
[00:15:22.012 --> 00:15:25.094]  I had no idea there was no security at the Capitol.
[00:15:25.094 --> 00:15:28.636]  He had a space to speak between the Capitol and the Supreme Court.
[00:15:28.636 --> 00:15:29.697]  That's all on record.
[00:15:29.697 --> 00:15:32.419]  I don't go watch violent attacks in the streets.
[00:15:32.419 --> 00:15:34.580]  I don't go riot attack Capitals.
[00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:39.283]  I went and protested in different parts of the country at Capitals with no incident in the months before January 6th.
[00:15:39.283 --> 00:15:40.484]  Everybody knows that.
[00:15:40.484 --> 00:15:42.626]  And to sit there and preposterously say,
[00:15:43.988 --> 00:15:50.275]  That I wanted that disaster to happen, that hurt our country, is a pack of lies.
[00:15:50.275 --> 00:15:53.680]  I don't know, if somebody donates the money, I'll fall suit on the guy.
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:56.743]  Man, I'm getting sick of hearing these lying pieces of garbage.
[00:15:56.743 --> 00:15:57.164]  Be right back.
[00:15:59.531 --> 00:16:05.795]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution is laying right there in front of you, hidden in plain view.
[00:16:05.795 --> 00:16:08.777]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[00:16:08.777 --> 00:16:18.323]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website where they admit the number one cause of cognitive disability in the world is iodine deficiency.
[00:16:18.323 --> 00:16:20.265]  The number one preventable cause
[00:16:20.985 --> 00:16:31.887]  of intellectual disability is lack of real pure iodine in the body as they bomb us with the bad halogens bromine, bromide, chlorine and so much more.
[00:16:31.887 --> 00:16:41.809]  Upwards of 2 billion people in a Lancet medical journal study in 2007 worldwide have cognitive disabilities because they don't have high quality iodine.
[00:16:41.809 --> 00:16:44.189]  Most iodine is bound to other elements, you don't absorb it.
[00:16:44.189 --> 00:16:47.250]  We have X3, all three types of good iodine together
[00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:48.270]  Let's go!
[00:17:06.677 --> 00:17:10.421]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[00:17:10.421 --> 00:17:17.307]  TurboForce is back in stock at InfowarsStore.com or AAA253-3139.
[00:17:17.307 --> 00:17:23.733]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[00:17:23.733 --> 00:17:24.834]  Should be called 10-hour energy.
[00:17:25.474 --> 00:17:38.566]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[00:17:38.566 --> 00:17:40.547]  It is the super fuel.
[00:17:40.547 --> 00:17:42.029]  RainForce Plus is great.
[00:17:42.029 --> 00:17:42.869]  RainForce Ultra is great.
[00:17:42.869 --> 00:17:43.850]  They're two different nootropics.
[00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:45.031]  They go good with this.
[00:17:45.031 --> 00:17:47.053]  But this is the King Kong.
[00:17:47.771 --> 00:17:49.253]  This is the Boss.
[00:17:49.253 --> 00:17:49.994]  TurboForce.
[00:17:49.994 --> 00:17:51.015]  Back in stock.
[00:17:51.015 --> 00:17:52.016]  Discounted.
[00:17:52.016 --> 00:17:53.758]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:17:53.758 --> 00:17:54.619]  More power.
[00:17:54.619 --> 00:17:55.620]  More strength.
[00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:56.141]  More energy.
[00:17:59.269 --> 00:18:06.694]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into the atmosphere.
[00:18:06.694 --> 00:18:09.495]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[00:18:09.495 --> 00:18:17.861]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers to convert these gases into fluorosilicic acid.
[00:18:17.861 --> 00:18:20.282]  Still highly toxic, but containable.
[00:18:20.282 --> 00:18:23.284]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison.
[00:18:23.584 --> 00:18:26.166]  And there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[00:18:26.166 --> 00:18:34.571]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the Secretary of the Treasury, who was responsible for the Public Health Service at the time.
[00:18:34.571 --> 00:18:36.413]  And by 1950, the U.S.
[00:18:36.413 --> 00:18:43.037]  government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste product and dumping it into our drinking water.
[00:18:43.497 --> 00:18:48.681]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[00:18:48.681 --> 00:18:54.806]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water and a remedy to this madness.
[00:18:54.806 --> 00:19:00.010]  Available now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:01.411]  InfoWars.
[00:19:01.411 --> 00:19:03.432]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:19:03.432 --> 00:19:05.193]  This is their big move.
[00:19:05.193 --> 00:19:08.976]  So yeah, you say, why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States?
[00:19:08.976 --> 00:19:09.897]  He doesn't care.
[00:19:10.666 --> 00:19:11.928]  That's not his job.
[00:19:11.928 --> 00:19:13.670]  He's not the President of the United States.
[00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:17.536]  He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[00:19:17.536 --> 00:19:22.022]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased.
[00:19:22.022 --> 00:19:23.144]  They must be opposed.
[00:19:23.752 --> 00:19:27.194]  Autocrats only understand one word.
[00:19:27.194 --> 00:19:28.375]  No.
[00:19:28.375 --> 00:19:29.216]  No.
[00:19:29.216 --> 00:19:29.976]  No.
[00:19:29.976 --> 00:19:30.857]  Exactly.
[00:19:30.857 --> 00:19:34.439]  And that's why we say no to your vaccines.
[00:19:34.439 --> 00:19:37.541]  We say no to you shutting down our businesses.
[00:19:37.541 --> 00:19:40.023]  We say no to you taking our firearms.
[00:19:40.023 --> 00:19:42.524]  We say no to you censoring our free speech.
[00:19:42.524 --> 00:19:46.147]  We say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization.
[00:19:46.147 --> 00:19:48.669]  We say no to you getting us into World War III.
[00:19:48.669 --> 00:19:49.069]  You're right.
[00:19:49.349 --> 00:19:54.094]  We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden, and we say no!
[00:19:54.094 --> 00:20:01.281]  And we say no to your war!
[00:20:01.281 --> 00:20:05.886]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:20:05.886 --> 00:20:07.188]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:30.609 --> 00:20:41.497]  So, two days ago, two drones, launched somewhere inside Russia, were launched at the Kremlin at Vladimir Putin's residence.
[00:20:41.497 --> 00:20:45.520]  The equivalent of flying drones into the White House.
[00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:51.103]  They were shot down using electromagnetic weapons.
[00:20:51.103 --> 00:20:57.108]  Now, the Russians don't have a motive in this, and
[00:20:58.123 --> 00:21:07.148]  The Ukrainians have been launching attacks for the last seven months into Western Russia, into the suburbs of Moscow, into Moscow.
[00:21:07.148 --> 00:21:08.849]  They've been blowing people up in their cars.
[00:21:08.849 --> 00:21:10.129]  They've been shooting people.
[00:21:10.129 --> 00:21:11.090]  They've been poisoning people.
[00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:12.811]  They've been blowing up power plants.
[00:21:12.811 --> 00:21:14.531]  They've been sabotaging.
[00:21:14.531 --> 00:21:15.952]  And they've been bragging about it.
[00:21:15.952 --> 00:21:17.873]  And they said, we're going to launch more attacks.
[00:21:17.873 --> 00:21:18.914]  We're going to park tanks.
[00:21:20.126 --> 00:21:21.887]  In Red Square, out front the Kremlin.
[00:21:21.887 --> 00:21:26.028]  That's what their head of their military said two months ago.
[00:21:26.028 --> 00:21:29.829]  And we know Biden bragged they're gonna blow the pipeline up and blew it up.
[00:21:29.829 --> 00:21:37.591]  But the controlled media is so bad in the West, the BBC and others are reporting, full of Yahoo News, that they think Putin blew up the pipeline.
[00:21:37.591 --> 00:21:39.892]  With no evidence of that.
[00:21:39.892 --> 00:21:42.693]  Or pipelines.
[00:21:42.693 --> 00:21:45.294]  This was obviously meant, and I said this on
[00:21:46.667 --> 00:21:55.775]  Wednesday in Crowder's studio, and I said it again yesterday in studio, this is done to push the Russians to escalate so NATO can officially get in the war.
[00:21:55.775 --> 00:21:58.357]  That's how crazy and what Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:21:58.357 --> 00:22:00.598]  said deranged this is.
[00:22:00.598 --> 00:22:04.662]  He said this is incredibly dangerous and is deranged and is insane.
[00:22:04.662 --> 00:22:07.404]  Deranged is the proper word for this.
[00:22:07.404 --> 00:22:09.085]  Okay?
[00:22:09.085 --> 00:22:14.230]  What would we do if the Russians flew explosive drones into the White House?
[00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:15.631]  We would go completely ape.
[00:22:17.617 --> 00:22:23.682]  So, the new spin is the Russians did this with no evidence.
[00:22:23.682 --> 00:22:26.504]  And the Russians have been trying to de-escalate this to get a peace deal.
[00:22:26.504 --> 00:22:28.685]  That's what they've been saying for nine years.
[00:22:28.685 --> 00:22:31.368]  We've been at war with them for nine years in a proxy war.
[00:22:31.368 --> 00:22:34.350]  Putin was losing a year and a half ago, so he launched this invasion.
[00:22:35.762 --> 00:22:48.915]  Now I covered all this on Wednesday and Thursday, but here is a former case officer, top analyst, you name it, former CIA officer says decision to drone attack Kremlin was made by the United States.
[00:22:48.915 --> 00:22:55.141]  He goes on to say we know this because the United States is running NATO and running the attacks and that's all come out.
[00:22:55.141 --> 00:22:55.942]  I told you U.S.
[00:22:55.942 --> 00:22:58.525]  troops were fighting Russians six years ago in Ukraine.
[00:22:59.767 --> 00:23:02.208]  I know troops that have served multiple tours.
[00:23:02.208 --> 00:23:08.552]  I have friends that have been there for years fighting Russians, killing Russians, and having their friends killed.
[00:23:08.552 --> 00:23:12.394]  They didn't give me the details of the secret operations, but they've been there.
[00:23:12.394 --> 00:23:15.056]  I know a lot of people in the military that have been there.
[00:23:15.056 --> 00:23:17.737]  I've had family that's been there.
[00:23:17.737 --> 00:23:19.839]  Officially in Poland.
[00:23:19.839 --> 00:23:21.119]  Not in Poland.
[00:23:21.119 --> 00:23:25.522]  I told you that before the war officially started last February.
[00:23:25.522 --> 00:23:26.983]  The year before this February.
[00:23:27.808 --> 00:23:33.813]  So, former CIA officer says decision to drone attack Kremlin was made by the United States.
[00:23:33.813 --> 00:23:39.618]  Former CIA intelligence officer Larry Johnson says the decision to launch a drone attack on the Kremlin was made by the United States.
[00:23:39.618 --> 00:23:48.886]  The Wednesday attack, which was likely to have been targeting Russian President Vladimir Putin, was stopped by electronic warfare systems, which disabled the drones before they could reach their targets.
[00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:55.004]  According to Johnson, the attack must have been spearheaded by the Biden administration and the U.S.
[00:23:55.004 --> 00:24:00.469]  military-industrial complex because, quote, decisions on such attacks are made not by Kiev but by Washington.
[00:24:00.469 --> 00:24:04.613]  Washington should understand clearly that we know this, Johnson told reporters.
[00:24:04.613 --> 00:24:12.720]  Although the attack, which Ukraine denied, was involved and it failed to accomplish its tactical goal, it was still highly symbolic, according to Johnson.
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:16.323]  He goes on to say they're trying to trick the Russians into escalating.
[00:24:16.923 --> 00:24:19.484]  Drones over Kremlin likely launched from inside Russia.
[00:24:19.484 --> 00:24:19.804]  U.S.
[00:24:19.804 --> 00:24:21.185]  experts say, U.S.
[00:24:21.185 --> 00:24:24.826]  News & World Report, they go on to imply that means the Russians did it.
[00:24:24.826 --> 00:24:34.990]  Oh, so when Alexander Dugin's daughter gets blown up, and they try to kill him, or other reporters get blown up, and other journalists, because it's launched inside Russia, it means the Russians did it?
[00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:35.550]  Hogwash!
[00:24:37.148 --> 00:24:41.270]  Wagner boss makes major battlefield exit after grisly video.
[00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:51.856]  Says his troops that have been winning the war have no ammo and that the general staff are against him and so he's pulling his troops out saying we are not here to carry out a suicide mission.
[00:24:51.856 --> 00:24:56.879]  Even though 60% of them have been dying with ammunition.
[00:24:56.879 --> 00:24:59.140]  And it goes on from that point.
[00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:03.122]  Terrified Russian men are changing their gender to avoid being sent to war in Ukraine.
[00:25:05.157 --> 00:25:06.798]  All right.
[00:25:06.798 --> 00:25:08.800]  That's the news on that front.
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:19.167]  I want to play a clip from Scott Ritter, former top UN weapons inspector and former nuclear arms negotiator with the Russians back in the 1980s and 90s.
[00:25:19.167 --> 00:25:21.388]  One of the top experts out there.
[00:25:21.388 --> 00:25:23.990]  He's reporting from Moscow.
[00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:26.592]  Let's go to Scott Ritter.
[00:25:26.592 --> 00:25:33.717]  Hey, Alex, this is Scott Ritter talking to you from Irkutsk, Russia, just with a brief comment on the
[00:25:35.273 --> 00:25:41.079]  The drone attack against the Kremlin that took place last night.
[00:25:41.079 --> 00:25:50.229]  Right now the feeling is that this was an attack carried out, if not directly by Ukraine, definitely on the orders of Ukraine.
[00:25:52.108 --> 00:26:05.456]  And I think Dmitry Medvedev, the former president of Russia, has said it best, that the Zelensky regime and Zelensky himself will probably have to be liquidated, which means killed.
[00:26:05.456 --> 00:26:12.060]  Now, some people out there might think that that's a rather harsh response, but I would ask them to consider the following.
[00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:20.766]  If there was a hostile actor who had said they plan on attacking the White House with drones, and then drones attack the White House,
[00:26:21.769 --> 00:26:26.752]  How long do you think it would take for the United States to eliminate them from the face of the Earth?
[00:26:26.752 --> 00:26:29.294]  The answer is not very long.
[00:26:29.294 --> 00:26:47.685]  So it's a double standard, a little bit of hypocrisy to have a situation where the Ukrainians say, we plan on sending drones to attack Moscow on or about May 9th, Victory Day, and then a pair of drones arrives in Moscow and hits the Kremlin.
[00:26:50.689 --> 00:26:56.853]  Ukraine said they were going to do it, it was done, and now I think the Ukrainians are going to be held fully accountable for it.
[00:26:56.853 --> 00:27:12.443]  How and when this will occur, it's a decision only the Russian government can make, but I think Dmitry Medvedev's sentiment is shared widely amongst the Russian people, and there will be an accounting, and it isn't going to end well for Zelensky.
[00:27:12.443 --> 00:27:16.966]  Again, Alex, thanks for giving me a chance to address this, and hope to talk to you soon.
[00:27:19.764 --> 00:27:20.764]  All right.
[00:27:20.764 --> 00:27:23.505]  Glad that he was able to send us that report.
[00:27:23.505 --> 00:27:26.625]  Thank you, Scott Ritter.
[00:27:26.625 --> 00:27:27.225]  We're going to go to break.
[00:27:27.225 --> 00:27:31.686]  We're going to come back with Norm Pattis and other lawyers from the show trial.
[00:27:31.686 --> 00:27:36.887]  They should send a cold chill up all America's spines with the total weaponization of the courts.
[00:27:36.887 --> 00:27:38.527]  We have some really good news.
[00:27:38.527 --> 00:27:42.388]  Our number one best-selling product, sold out for more than six months, is back.
[00:27:42.388 --> 00:27:44.789]  It is X3, the deep-earth crystal iodine.
[00:27:44.789 --> 00:27:47.089]  Two other types for better absorption, the studies show.
[00:27:47.829 --> 00:27:47.949]  Okay.
[00:28:03.778 --> 00:28:04.379]  We're good to go.
[00:28:31.519 --> 00:28:33.960]  Back in stock, X3, finally.
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:39.403]  Also, TurboForce, back in stock, InfowarStore.com.

[00:28:49.828 --> 00:28:54.991]  InfowarStore.com and get a great reset in the War of the World book, either signed or unsigned as well.
[00:28:54.991 --> 00:28:56.512]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:28:56.512 --> 00:28:57.072]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:00.401 --> 00:29:02.982]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[00:29:02.982 --> 00:29:05.224]  Please write this down and please go look this up.
[00:29:05.224 --> 00:29:07.225]  It will change your life.
[00:29:07.225 --> 00:29:15.989]  The UN admits and the Lansing Medical Journal admits that upwards of 2 billion people have mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities.
[00:29:15.989 --> 00:29:21.312]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[00:29:21.312 --> 00:29:22.793]  Most iodine in the environment
[00:29:23.493 --> 00:29:27.036]  is bound to other elements so your body can't absorb it.
[00:29:27.036 --> 00:29:31.500]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:38.586]  And InfoWarStore.com has the only iodine out there that actually has this type of full effect.
[00:29:38.586 --> 00:29:44.591]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3's been sold out for six months, it's very hard to produce, and it's finally back in stock.
[00:29:45.151 --> 00:29:47.515]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[00:29:47.515 --> 00:29:49.778]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is powerful.
[00:29:49.778 --> 00:29:51.580]  You and your family need it.
[00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:53.323]  It's 25% off back in stock.
[00:29:53.323 --> 00:29:57.549]  X3 Tri-Iodine, exclusively at Infowarshore.com.
[00:29:57.549 --> 00:30:00.013]  Take action now, but regardless, research is info.
[00:30:01.468 --> 00:30:04.611]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[00:30:04.611 --> 00:30:06.913]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[00:30:06.913 --> 00:30:10.836]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[00:30:10.836 --> 00:30:18.923]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[00:30:18.923 --> 00:30:27.570]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[00:30:28.576 --> 00:30:32.218]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[00:30:32.218 --> 00:30:38.000]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.042]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[00:30:41.042 --> 00:30:49.986]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, all at the same time keep us on air.
[00:30:49.986 --> 00:30:53.368]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:30:54.288 --> 00:30:59.231]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to MFORCE4.com, our funding problems will be over.
[00:30:59.231 --> 00:31:00.512]  Please take action now.
[00:31:00.512 --> 00:31:06.516]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move against Tucker Carlson and take him off the air.
[00:31:06.516 --> 00:31:09.157]  People said, no way, he's the most powerful thing that ever happened.
[00:31:09.157 --> 00:31:11.359]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[00:31:11.359 --> 00:31:13.940]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him.
[00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:17.162]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[00:31:17.162 --> 00:31:18.483]  It's the same thing with MFORCE.
[00:31:18.923 --> 00:31:25.528]  But M4 Wars is not owned by Fox, or controlled by George Soros, or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[00:31:25.528 --> 00:31:28.331]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[00:31:29.318 --> 00:31:31.419]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[00:31:31.419 --> 00:31:36.043]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[00:31:36.043 --> 00:31:39.765]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[00:31:39.765 --> 00:31:42.907]  So I want to thank you for your support and encourage viewers and listeners to understand.
[00:31:42.907 --> 00:31:45.469]  Please don't take InfoWars for granted.
[00:31:45.469 --> 00:31:46.810]  We're barely hanging on.
[00:31:46.810 --> 00:31:52.594]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support, while getting great products at the same time at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:31:52.594 --> 00:31:53.954]  So don't procrastinate.
[00:31:53.954 --> 00:31:55.275]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:31:55.275 --> 00:31:59.238]  Get amazing products that keep us on the air and never submit to these tyrants.
[00:31:59.479 --> 00:32:01.329]  Watch...right now!
[00:32:02.423 --> 00:32:12.828]  I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to InfoWarsTore.com and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that empower your immune system and your body, and keep us on air.
[00:32:12.828 --> 00:32:21.191]  I am humbly, hand-in-hand, talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in, many of you for years, and never gone to InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:32:21.191 --> 00:32:29.675]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you never actually go to InfoWarsTore.com and never experience these great products and never find the operation.
[00:32:29.975 --> 00:32:33.037]  Sure, you share a link, you share an article, you tell folks about the show.
[00:32:33.037 --> 00:32:34.399]  That's great, and I thank you.
[00:32:34.399 --> 00:32:35.920]  But we need funds to operate.
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:44.286]  Plus, we've got really great products that do amazing things for people, like our CBD oil, and our Fizzy Magnesium, and our Sleep Aid, and our Nitric Oxide, and our Real Red Pill.
[00:32:44.286 --> 00:32:46.368]  Plus, all of these are really great products.
[00:32:46.368 --> 00:32:47.248]  They keep us on air.
[00:32:47.248 --> 00:32:49.030]  Plus, you're missing out on having these products.
[00:32:49.030 --> 00:32:50.331]  So, get off the bench.
[00:32:50.331 --> 00:32:51.172]  Get in the game.
[00:32:51.172 --> 00:32:57.917]  Step to the plate, and go to InfoWarsTore.com right now, and get these great InfoWars products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:33:01.215 --> 00:33:18.528]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[00:33:18.528 --> 00:33:22.871]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:22.871 --> 00:33:28.535]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[00:33:33.103 --> 00:33:40.198]  I warned everyone with the Sandy Hook show trials that were totally rigged where I was found guilty by the judges and the juries were told to find me guilty.
[00:33:41.215 --> 00:33:47.838]  Guilty until proven more guilty that it was a beta test to take everybody else out and now they admit that with Fox News.
[00:33:47.838 --> 00:33:54.061]  Well Norm Pass is one of the main lawyers on the nearly five-month trial there in the District of Mordor.
[00:33:54.061 --> 00:33:57.282]  First they came for Alex Jones and you cheered because you disagree with him.
[00:33:57.282 --> 00:34:01.204]  Then they came for the Proud Boys because you cheered because you disagree with them.
[00:34:01.204 --> 00:34:04.305]  Then they came for Donald Trump and you cheered because you disagree with him.
[00:34:04.305 --> 00:34:05.186]  Then they came for you.
[00:34:06.971 --> 00:34:09.733]  And that is exactly what has happened.
[00:34:09.733 --> 00:34:15.897]  Riffing off the famous pastor that said, first they came for the trade unionists, and I wasn't a trade unionist, so I said nothing.
[00:34:15.897 --> 00:34:19.560]  Then they came for the communists, I wasn't a communist, so I said nothing.
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:22.402]  Then they came for the Jews, I wasn't Jewish, so I said nothing.
[00:34:22.402 --> 00:34:25.024]  Then they came for me, and there was no one left to stand up for me.
[00:34:26.226 --> 00:34:36.991]  Now, we may have to hold these guys a little bit the next hour, or we may have to skip this next break, because I want them to really drill in and say what can be said now that was secret in the trial, that the judge didn't want you to know.
[00:34:36.991 --> 00:34:39.832]  That they had feds there, helping break into the building.
[00:34:39.832 --> 00:34:49.416]  They had feds inside the Proud Boys, trying to provocateur them, and CIA-connected operatives, and sex operatives, and that none of this was ever allowed to be shown to the jury.
[00:34:50.776 --> 00:35:00.884]  And that's why there were so many days where they would shut down the jury and then the judge would kick the media out and explain, you're not going to bring forward any of this information.
[00:35:00.884 --> 00:35:02.765]  There's a big article about it on gatewaypundit.com.
[00:35:02.765 --> 00:35:06.147]  J6 political prisoner, Dominic Pozzola's attorney.
[00:35:06.147 --> 00:35:08.789]  Evidence confirms J6 was an organized government plot.
[00:35:08.789 --> 00:35:12.072]  There is no evidence of conspiracy by the Patriots.
[00:35:12.072 --> 00:35:19.217]  But here, before I go to the lawyers, is the Lincoln Project founder, calls for Alex Jones, Roger Stone, Steve Manin, and Donald Trump to be arrested.
[00:35:19.217 --> 00:35:19.898]  And he says
[00:35:20.458 --> 00:35:22.099]  That we ran the attack.
[00:35:22.099 --> 00:35:23.600]  No, I didn't.
[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:25.601]  I protested at dozens of capitals.
[00:35:25.601 --> 00:35:28.904]  I had rallies with 500,000 people the month before in D.C.
[00:35:28.904 --> 00:35:30.665]  I've never attacked people at rallies.
[00:35:30.665 --> 00:35:32.346]  I don't believe in offensive violence.
[00:35:32.346 --> 00:35:33.487]  And I have no history of that.
[00:35:33.487 --> 00:35:35.488]  And I tried to stop people going in the building.
[00:35:35.488 --> 00:35:36.989]  And how dare you!
[00:35:36.989 --> 00:35:39.531]  How dare you imply that I...
[00:35:40.845 --> 00:35:42.686]  Ordered and commanded this.
[00:35:42.686 --> 00:35:45.727]  That is outrageous, and you know it's not true.
[00:35:45.727 --> 00:35:50.449]  And I'm not a litigious person, but man, at a certain point, I gotta start suing people.
[00:35:50.449 --> 00:35:52.750]  This is outrageous.
[00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:54.311]  Absolutely outrageous.
[00:35:54.311 --> 00:36:00.454]  Norm Pattis was my criminal lawyer on this when I was deposed by Congress and the J6 kangaroo committee.
[00:36:00.994 --> 00:36:08.839]  He went through all my phones, all my emails, interviewed my staff, and he said, you aren't just somebody that tried to spit, you were a hero.
[00:36:08.839 --> 00:36:17.605]  I'm not saying I was a hero, but the point is I went into the tear gas to try to stop the situation because it was a disaster for our country and let them demonize the American people as terrorists.
[00:36:17.605 --> 00:36:30.534]  Here's a short clip of the Lincoln Project founder defaming me and saying he wants me, not just, he's not just lying to hurt me or put me out of business or taking off the air, he wants me behind bars for decades.
[00:36:30.814 --> 00:36:31.894]  We're good to go.
[00:37:01.107 --> 00:37:03.048]  Today's a good day to accuse me.
[00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:31.481]  Of orchestrating that fiasco.
[00:37:31.481 --> 00:37:34.543]  I wasn't Ray Epps out there days before saying attack the Capitol.
[00:37:34.543 --> 00:37:39.445]  I didn't testify to Congress that I sent text messages like Ray Epps did saying he quote orchestrated it.
[00:37:39.445 --> 00:37:41.326]  I didn't help ram signs over the police.
[00:37:41.326 --> 00:37:47.990]  I went and tried to work with the police to get on their speaker systems that they wouldn't use to tell people get the hell out of the Capitol before Ashley Babbitt died!
[00:37:49.502 --> 00:37:50.282]  Norm, I'm ranting.
[00:37:50.282 --> 00:37:56.604]  I want to give you the floor and Steve Metcalf, one of the other great lawyers that took on this rigged case.
[00:37:56.604 --> 00:38:02.226]  I know you fought like the devil to try to tell the jury the truth, but we're stopped.
[00:38:02.226 --> 00:38:13.770]  So, you can lead this here, Norm, but I really want to get into all the stuff that I was told by sources that I brought to you that you said you would later be able to talk about with this really being evidence of how this was orchestrated.
[00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:15.511]  So, Norm Padish, start wherever you'd like, my friend.
[00:38:16.496 --> 00:38:19.437]  There was no conspiracy.
[00:38:19.437 --> 00:38:21.538]  There was no plot.
[00:38:21.538 --> 00:38:32.703]  There was no implicit understanding among anyone to do anything of the sort on January 6th among the Proud Boys, or as near as I can tell, anyone else.
[00:38:32.703 --> 00:38:35.545]  And the United States government knows it.
[00:38:35.545 --> 00:38:42.008]  Because when they argued, in closing arguments in this case, they said the conspiracy may have been formed instantaneously.
[00:38:42.008 --> 00:38:44.689]  That conduct reflected this understanding.
[00:38:45.191 --> 00:38:47.488]  Here's what happened in the January 6 trial.
[00:38:48.177 --> 00:38:51.758]  Whether rightly or wrongly, Donald Trump believed the election was stolen.
[00:38:51.758 --> 00:38:54.420]  He got 70 million American votes.
[00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:56.100]  He wanted to stop the steal.
[00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:57.961]  He turned a lawful process.
[00:38:57.961 --> 00:39:01.342]  He wanted people to turn up at the Capitol to protest.
[00:39:01.342 --> 00:39:02.963]  He urged them to do so.
[00:39:02.963 --> 00:39:08.865]  And from the, um, the, the ellipse outside the White House that day, he directed people to the Capitol.
[00:39:08.865 --> 00:39:14.648]  It was an angry crowd because the commander in chief said the election was stolen.
[00:39:14.648 --> 00:39:15.448]  Stop the steal.
[00:39:16.028 --> 00:39:20.971]  These people went to the Capitol and a match was lit, and we don't know who lit it.
[00:39:20.971 --> 00:39:23.373]  There's Ray Epps, who's never going to be charged.
[00:39:23.373 --> 00:39:25.194]  Some people say the government did it.
[00:39:25.194 --> 00:39:38.123]  Alex, I don't see evidence of that, but here's what I saw at the trial, and I don't mean to hog the stage from my colleague, Mr. Metcalf, who I'm introducing you folks to today, a brilliant lawyer, young man who I hope to know for many years to come.
[00:39:38.123 --> 00:39:43.386]  But here's what happened, as near as I could tell, and here's what we can talk about at the trial and what we can't.
[00:39:43.386 --> 00:39:45.668]  And this is a note to Jim Jordan, if you're watching.
[00:39:46.228 --> 00:39:55.394]  Get that Weaponization Committee to subpoena the trial transcripts, in this case, all of them, including the transcripts that are under seal.
[00:39:55.394 --> 00:40:01.038]  Because Steve and I are still prohibited from speaking about what we heard in closed proceedings.
[00:40:01.038 --> 00:40:06.942]  But what we can say, at least what I believe I can fairly say, is the government fought
[00:40:07.362 --> 00:40:11.147]  To prevent the truth from being presented at that trial.
[00:40:11.147 --> 00:40:24.783]  And the truth is that the FBI has a program in which they register confidential human sources that are engaged or embedded within or are reporting on domestic groups.
[00:40:24.783 --> 00:40:27.186]  And they keep that as a closely held secret.
[00:40:27.626 --> 00:40:37.509]  They keep it secret from prosecutors, they keep it secret from the courts, they keep it secret from other investigators, and it's only accessed on a need-to-know basis.
[00:40:37.509 --> 00:40:40.270]  And so we wanted all that information.
[00:40:40.270 --> 00:40:42.471]  We were prohibited that information.
[00:40:42.471 --> 00:40:48.793]  Instead, the government folded and as a compromise gave us a stipulation there were at least eight
[00:40:49.463 --> 00:40:58.386]  Maybe more confidential sources reporting to the FBI on the Proud Boys from the election of 2020 through January 6th of 2021.
[00:40:58.386 --> 00:41:08.110]  We use that to argue to the jury that don't you think if the FBI had its knuckle-draggers in the group and there was some conspiracy, somebody would have reported something?
[00:41:08.110 --> 00:41:11.411]  Well, they didn't report anything because there was nothing there.
[00:41:11.411 --> 00:41:14.773]  So in this trial, in this historic trial,
[00:41:15.473 --> 00:41:25.324]  The text messages of patriots who are upset about what was going on in this country were used to prove that when they went to an event that turned into a riot, they planned the riot.
[00:41:25.324 --> 00:41:30.971]  Alex, excuse my language, excuse this, I know it's a family show, if that is pure and utter
[00:41:31.471 --> 00:41:32.312]  Bullshit.
[00:41:32.312 --> 00:41:34.773]  And the United States government knows it.
[00:41:34.773 --> 00:41:40.496]  And so for these people on the Lincoln Project to sit back and say, Oh, Alex should be prosecuted.
[00:41:40.496 --> 00:41:42.617]  Oh, Roger Stone should be prosecuted.
[00:41:42.617 --> 00:41:46.199]  I've been up one side of your communications and down the other for years.
[00:41:47.319 --> 00:41:49.742]  I've gotten to know everyone in your organization.
[00:41:49.742 --> 00:41:51.463]  I've gotten to know you.
[00:41:51.463 --> 00:41:53.785]  I've sat through a four and a half month trial.
[00:41:53.785 --> 00:41:56.648]  I've reviewed the trial transcripts of the Oath Keepers.
[00:41:56.648 --> 00:42:02.474]  There is about as much evidence that you were involved in planning this as there was the Lincoln Project.
[00:42:02.854 --> 00:42:09.700]  And so that is an utterly irresponsible and defamatory accusation by a thug in a car.
[00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:15.925]  And what that thug wants to do is he wants to put a thumb on free speech and say, if you agree with me, you can talk.
[00:42:15.925 --> 00:42:20.629]  But if you petition for redress of grievance and something goes wrong, you're going to go to prison.
[00:42:21.229 --> 00:42:23.010]  Absolutely chilling day, Alex.
[00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:25.312]  Absolutely chilling day in American Jurisprudence.
[00:42:25.312 --> 00:42:27.653]  I was so devastated after the verdict last night.
[00:42:27.653 --> 00:42:30.715]  So angry, humiliated, disturbed, depressed.
[00:42:30.715 --> 00:42:32.736]  I just came and sat in my room all evening.
[00:42:32.736 --> 00:42:35.798]  I went out later in the evening to have a couple drinks with Steve.
[00:42:35.798 --> 00:42:41.141]  But it was a total, total disaster for people who believe in freedom of speech.
[00:42:41.141 --> 00:42:46.605]  And I do believe prosecutors have discretion about what to charge and what not to charge.
[00:42:47.365 --> 00:42:51.668]  First, they came for you with deplatforming and this bogus Sandy Hook thing.
[00:42:51.668 --> 00:42:54.790]  Then they came for the Proud Boys, and they got you.
[00:42:54.790 --> 00:42:56.230]  And they got the Proud Boys.
[00:42:56.230 --> 00:42:57.751]  And next it'll be Trump.
[00:42:57.751 --> 00:43:02.714]  And when they've run out of enemies, it's going to come down to the people who supported all of you.
[00:43:02.714 --> 00:43:06.556]  And you need to fight back now.
[00:43:06.556 --> 00:43:08.858]  Norm, introduce Steve Metcalf to us.
[00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:11.491]  Steve Metcalf, I had the pleasure of meeting.
[00:43:11.491 --> 00:43:12.771]  He's from New York and Baltimore.
[00:43:12.771 --> 00:43:14.532]  He represented Dominic Pozzola.
[00:43:14.532 --> 00:43:18.674]  Pozzola was the fellow you saw on films using a shield to break a window.
[00:43:18.674 --> 00:43:22.396]  Pozzola was the only proud boy to be acquitted of seditious conspiracy.
[00:43:22.396 --> 00:43:25.998]  That was an enormous accomplishment for Mr. Metcalf.
[00:43:25.998 --> 00:43:28.159]  But Steve is a street fighter.
[00:43:28.159 --> 00:43:29.499]  He's a lifelong friend.
[00:43:29.499 --> 00:43:31.560]  I spent four and a half months with him.
[00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:34.202]  Ask us about Nigel and Rupert a little later, Alex.
[00:43:34.202 --> 00:43:34.882]  Here's Steve.
[00:43:34.882 --> 00:43:36.643]  Steve, what do you think happened at that trial?
[00:43:38.151 --> 00:43:41.994]  Well, I got the pleasure to sit next to Norm every single day.
[00:43:41.994 --> 00:43:43.856]  I learned a lot from him.
[00:43:43.856 --> 00:43:45.938]  We tried to make the best of it.
[00:43:45.938 --> 00:43:46.798]  We tried to have fun.
[00:43:46.798 --> 00:43:50.722]  We tried to laugh, even during some of the darkest times.
[00:43:50.722 --> 00:43:59.949]  And when I mean the darkest times, Alex, they literally took private messages from these individuals, their most deepest messages.
[00:43:59.949 --> 00:44:05.074]  I'm talking about one of the defendants, his messages to his mother were displayed for the jury.
[00:44:05.074 --> 00:44:06.415]  It was disgusting.
[00:44:06.855 --> 00:44:15.399]  How far they went and how much they cherry picked to put together some sort of orchestrated scenario that never actually made sense.
[00:44:15.399 --> 00:44:20.702]  Still to this day, I was able to stand up in front of the jury and talk about the timeline.
[00:44:20.702 --> 00:44:22.723]  What timeline are we even talking about?
[00:44:23.303 --> 00:44:26.104]  When did this conspiracy even start?
[00:44:26.104 --> 00:44:29.326]  When did this conspiracy come to fruition?
[00:44:29.326 --> 00:44:31.367]  Who was even a part of this conspiracy?
[00:44:31.367 --> 00:44:32.788]  There was nothing.
[00:44:32.788 --> 00:44:36.950]  All these questions were not answered by the U.S.
[00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:37.570]  government.
[00:44:37.570 --> 00:44:45.194]  And still somehow, some way, they convinced this jury and have convinced people for months
[00:44:45.894 --> 00:45:01.224]  That there was this grandiose scheme that was conducted by Theriot, or involved Theriot somehow as the leader, that is almost mind-blowing.
[00:45:01.224 --> 00:45:03.645]  In my closing, I said it was fairy dust.
[00:45:03.645 --> 00:45:07.688]  That it was a fairytale story that does not exist.
[00:45:07.688 --> 00:45:14.833]  I wanted to compare it to a Disney show, or to something that Steven Spielberg could write, because it was that bizarre.
[00:45:19.237 --> 00:45:23.561]  A lot of people rain on your parade saying you're a conspiracy theorist.
[00:45:23.561 --> 00:45:27.164]  The real conspiracy theorist in this case was the United States government.
[00:45:27.164 --> 00:45:33.591]  They took isolated strands of evidence and stitched it into a narrative and sold it as a conspiracy against the right.
[00:45:33.591 --> 00:45:37.595]  And the Lincoln Project's running with it, trying to up the ante in the next round of indictments.
[00:45:37.595 --> 00:45:38.756]  I didn't mean to cut you off, Steve.
[00:45:39.196 --> 00:45:39.876]  That's fine.
[00:45:39.876 --> 00:45:41.137]  I did it all trial.
[00:45:41.137 --> 00:45:42.878]  Why should today be any different, right?
[00:45:42.878 --> 00:45:46.781]  That's what I... Alex, I saw this coming from a mile away.
[00:45:46.781 --> 00:45:54.885]  And I, even before I met Norm, I did everything I possibly could to distance Dominic Pozzolo from everybody I possibly could.
[00:45:54.885 --> 00:45:57.487]  And I was able to effectively do that just enough
[00:45:58.007 --> 00:46:01.910]  To get him out of this group, in front of this jury panel, D.C.
[00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:04.571]  jury panel, I mean... That was my next question.
[00:46:04.571 --> 00:46:08.634]  What is wrong with D.C., New York, and Austin juries?
[00:46:08.634 --> 00:46:12.896]  They're known to be the most... San Francisco's almost as bad, but all the lawyers I've talked to say D.C.'
[00:46:12.876 --> 00:46:21.182]  's the worst, then New York, then Austin, Texas, then San Francisco, then some areas of Connecticut.
[00:46:21.182 --> 00:46:25.985]  I mean, these people will convict a newborn baby of mass murder.
[00:46:27.202 --> 00:46:33.227]  How are they able to do this?
[00:46:33.227 --> 00:46:38.011]  We fought like cats and dogs just to get the case transferred out of D.C.
[00:46:38.011 --> 00:46:42.154]  Nobody's won that fight, Alex, with regards to January 6th cases.
[00:46:42.154 --> 00:46:43.996]  So now we're in D.C.
[00:46:43.996 --> 00:46:46.178]  on a political case based on politics.
[00:46:50.791 --> 00:46:51.932]  Absolutely.
[00:46:51.932 --> 00:46:54.774]  I think that the numbers are even higher than 92%.
[00:46:54.774 --> 00:46:58.618]  Now, Alex, we spent over two weeks trying to pick this jury.
[00:46:58.618 --> 00:47:10.948]  And these potential jurors were coming into court saying that their preconceived notions of the Proud Boys were that they were white supremacists, that they were racist.
[00:47:10.948 --> 00:47:14.951]  And we would flag this for the court every single time.
[00:47:14.951 --> 00:47:16.052]  And without fail,
[00:47:18.035 --> 00:47:20.336]  The judge would let them be a prospective juror.
[00:47:20.336 --> 00:47:23.697]  And then, we only had 12 preemptory challenges.
[00:47:23.697 --> 00:47:25.898]  Norm, you remember that whole battle in the beginning?
[00:47:25.898 --> 00:47:26.598]  I do, yep.
[00:47:26.598 --> 00:47:32.720]  I moved, I made a motion that I wanted additional preemptory challenges for every defendant.
[00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:35.561]  Because we only had 12 preemptory challenges.
[00:47:35.561 --> 00:47:38.802]  The judge gave us two more for five defendants.
[00:47:39.642 --> 00:47:42.905]  I got up on, I got, I made a written motion, Alex.
[00:47:42.905 --> 00:47:48.670]  By the time I got up to the podium, I was so disgusted at what I saw.
[00:47:48.670 --> 00:47:56.598]  And the select committee was going on at the same time, making the same allegations about Trump and that they were going to come to this, this.
[00:47:56.598 --> 00:48:01.482]  It's on every TV channel saying they're white supremacists and terrorists in the same town.
[00:48:01.482 --> 00:48:02.043]  Here's the deal.
[00:48:03.821 --> 00:48:04.742]  They're not.
[00:48:04.742 --> 00:48:08.806]  I mean, I've gotten to know these guys.
[00:48:08.806 --> 00:48:12.429]  We sat with them for months, half a year in court proceedings.
[00:48:12.429 --> 00:48:16.252]  We've read hundreds of thousands of text messages, emails.
[00:48:16.252 --> 00:48:18.274]  I've read every book I can find on this.
[00:48:18.274 --> 00:48:22.838]  When you pick up the paper, they're a group of white supremacist extremists.
[00:48:22.838 --> 00:48:26.822]  When I talk to them, they're my next door neighbor and they're wondering what the hell's going on in this country.
[00:48:27.142 --> 00:48:35.988]  Most of the people who joined the Proud Boys, well, not most, many who joined the Proud Boys and who testified at trial talked about how they were radicalized in the summer of 2020.
[00:48:35.988 --> 00:48:38.089]  Everybody was locked down for COVID.
[00:48:38.089 --> 00:48:40.431]  Their businesses were suffering and struggling.
[00:48:40.431 --> 00:48:55.361]  And on television, while they're told to stay home or mask up when they go to the grocery store, they see people in mostly peaceful protests downtown and they see their communities going up in smoke and they see people who think like them being attacked by a mob and police did nothing.
[00:48:55.361 --> 00:48:57.022]  They thought the American dream was bad.
[00:48:57.022 --> 00:48:57.923]  Let me raise this.
[00:48:57.923 --> 00:48:59.524]  And I know I have sources, the same sources around you.
[00:48:59.524 --> 00:49:00.225]  You were very tight-lipped.
[00:49:00.225 --> 00:49:05.749]  I would call you about intel I got, and you'd say, well, that's pretty much what we're seeing, but I can't talk until this is over.
[00:49:05.749 --> 00:49:06.930]  Now you're saying you can't.
[00:49:06.930 --> 00:49:11.093]  But what about how the judge would not let the evidence that they had informants in
[00:49:26.886 --> 00:49:32.088]  The group and the informants were testifying and in the reports to the FBI, they were not planning this.
[00:49:32.088 --> 00:49:33.569]  I mean, I knew the Proud Boys.
[00:49:33.569 --> 00:49:36.010]  They were there in case Antifa attacked people.
[00:49:36.010 --> 00:49:38.311]  That was their only plan is what I heard about.
[00:49:38.311 --> 00:49:40.512]  There was no plan to attack the Capitol.
[00:49:40.512 --> 00:49:47.895]  I know once it was tear gas and police and provocateurs that weren't them attacking the police that they started, you know, having scuffles with them.
[00:49:48.775 --> 00:49:51.458]  Okay, that's a year or two in jail if you don't hurt a cop.
[00:49:51.458 --> 00:49:52.398]  But no cops were killed.
[00:49:52.398 --> 00:49:54.280]  They lied about that as well.
[00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:57.683]  So I was not expecting this because we've never been violent anywhere else.
[00:49:57.683 --> 00:49:59.685]  They've not been offensively violent anywhere else.
[00:49:59.685 --> 00:50:04.049]  So what can both of you say about what the judge suppressed from the jury?
[00:50:06.195 --> 00:50:13.820]  We had to fight very, very hard to even open the door to confidential sources.
[00:50:13.820 --> 00:50:16.561]  We weren't able to name three of them.
[00:50:16.561 --> 00:50:21.344]  We weren't able to name five of them in this case.
[00:50:21.344 --> 00:50:24.366]  We weren't able to find out how many there were.
[00:50:24.366 --> 00:50:31.830]  There continued to be disclosures during trial, including late in trial, that not just the FBI, but the Metro
[00:50:33.032 --> 00:50:33.652]  We're good to go.
[00:51:03.141 --> 00:51:04.143]  Excuse my language.
[00:51:04.143 --> 00:51:08.769]  This is the United States of America versus the Proud Boys, or versus our clients.
[00:51:08.769 --> 00:51:10.291]  That's what the caption read.
[00:51:10.291 --> 00:51:13.656]  And you're telling me that party can't tell us what it's doing?
[00:51:13.656 --> 00:51:16.479]  Steve Metcalf, do you have any comments about what the judge suppressed?
[00:51:17.597 --> 00:51:18.077]  I do.
[00:51:18.077 --> 00:51:22.459]  Alex, we had a little binder that had probably about a hundred pages in it.
[00:51:22.459 --> 00:51:24.540]  And it was a CHS binder.
[00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:29.063]  Now in this binder, we could not know people's identification.
[00:51:29.063 --> 00:51:30.864]  We could not know their names.
[00:51:30.864 --> 00:51:38.007]  We could not know a lot of different scenarios because of all the heavily redacted documents that were contained in this binder.
[00:51:38.007 --> 00:51:39.968]  We could not discuss this with our own clients.
[00:51:39.968 --> 00:51:41.649]  Still can't discuss this with our own clients.
[00:51:41.969 --> 00:51:51.475]  When we would find out something throughout the course of the trial and bring it to the judge's attention, all of a sudden a whole team from the government would show up and figure out a way to stonewall the situation.
[00:51:51.475 --> 00:51:53.176]  Steve, tell them what happened.
[00:51:53.176 --> 00:51:54.937]  There are so many informants in this case.
[00:51:54.937 --> 00:51:59.659]  Tell them what happened when Carmen started cross-examining and even the government didn't know the guy was a CHS.
[00:51:59.659 --> 00:52:00.080]  Remember that?
[00:52:01.921 --> 00:52:04.142]  That's just one of the many.
[00:52:04.142 --> 00:52:05.703]  Alex, let me tell you this.
[00:52:05.703 --> 00:52:17.130]  If Norm or I wanted to mention the word CHS or anything about these individuals, we had to ask for permission in front of the jury.
[00:52:17.130 --> 00:52:24.254]  We had to go separately to the phone and ask for permission to be able to raise one question about it.
[00:52:24.254 --> 00:52:25.675]  Norm actually did it first.
[00:52:25.675 --> 00:52:27.336]  I'll never forget the way Norm did it.
[00:52:28.297 --> 00:52:32.541]  He actually was crossing a witness and said, Judge, we got to step to the phones.
[00:52:32.541 --> 00:52:39.028]  And then that was the first time that the jury heard about there being CHS's in one particular instance.
[00:52:39.028 --> 00:52:47.336]  But yes, there were times, Alex, that we were talking about an individual that nobody on the defense side even knew was a CHS.
[00:52:47.336 --> 00:52:49.198]  And then we were finding that out.
[00:52:49.198 --> 00:52:50.840]  One of our own witnesses we found out.
[00:52:51.340 --> 00:53:09.431]  There was another attorney, another, the attorneys from Florida who represented Theriault had one of their first witnesses, the day before they were supposed to take the stand and testify, found out or were disclosed that that person was a CHS.
[00:53:09.991 --> 00:53:10.931]  Were you able to bring him?
[00:53:10.931 --> 00:53:12.311]  I mean, I know you guys tried.
[00:53:12.311 --> 00:53:13.612]  What about Ray Epps?
[00:53:13.612 --> 00:53:20.093]  I mean, he says, going to the Capitol the day before the day, he's there helping ram signs in the first breach over the police.
[00:53:20.093 --> 00:53:25.754]  He tells the J6 kangaroo committee that he, quote, orchestrated the attack.
[00:53:25.754 --> 00:53:28.515]  He sent his text messages bragging to family about it.
[00:53:28.515 --> 00:53:33.136]  How the hell is he not arrested or indicted and is now a victim according to the media?
[00:53:35.555 --> 00:53:43.622]  Alex, you gotta look even further, right there, at that scene right there where you see the guy with the red hat, Ryan Samso, Reyevs goes up to him right there.
[00:53:43.622 --> 00:53:47.926]  Seconds after that, the first gates start, that's the first breach.
[00:53:47.926 --> 00:53:58.315]  Then they go up all these stairs, and they're in the, um, they're in the, um, the yard right outside of the west, the lower west side.
[00:53:59.369 --> 00:54:03.931]  And you see Dominic Pizzola, my client there.
[00:54:03.931 --> 00:54:07.333]  Ray Epps comes to him and is speaking to him.
[00:54:07.333 --> 00:54:13.736]  This is moments before people start getting shot with rubber bullets from an elevated position.
[00:54:13.736 --> 00:54:17.098]  Ray Epps is all over the place.
[00:54:17.098 --> 00:54:25.642]  I can't tell you how many times we would be dissecting a video in court and out of nowhere, Ray Epps happens to be right in the middle of it.
[00:54:26.442 --> 00:54:29.084]  And here's something that's very interesting, Alex.
[00:54:29.084 --> 00:54:37.130]  In our fights with the government about confidential informants, they would always take the position, we can neither confirm nor deny that this person is a confidential informant.
[00:54:37.130 --> 00:54:39.412]  And from that, we were supposed to take that they weren't.
[00:54:39.412 --> 00:54:42.033]  Because if they were, we would be entitled to know about it.
[00:54:42.033 --> 00:54:44.215]  And so this was their position with regard to EPS.
[00:54:44.215 --> 00:54:45.556]  We can't confirm it or deny it.
[00:54:45.796 --> 00:54:54.579]  But if your viewers, or you watched the 60 Minute piece, they came out and denied that Epps was a CI in violation of their own stated policies.
[00:54:54.579 --> 00:54:57.060]  So they went way out of their way to protect this guy.
[00:54:57.060 --> 00:55:03.402]  Well, I mean, watching the footage, and I've looked at a lot of it, you've looked at more of it, it's like he's the Tom Brady.
[00:55:03.402 --> 00:55:04.222]  He's the quarterback.
[00:55:06.381 --> 00:55:16.706]  He was, as Steve pointed out, he was in the middle of this too many times, and for all these other incidental players, the people you're all seeing on your screen right now to be arrested, and he not.
[00:55:16.706 --> 00:55:18.246]  Somebody's got some splainin' to do.
[00:55:18.246 --> 00:55:26.350]  He's either a CI or he's got nude photographs of somebody, because he's walking away from trouble, and I don't understand it.
[00:55:26.350 --> 00:55:34.474]  If our clients did what you're seeing on your screen right now, there'd be a lip reader, a mind reader, and some Kreskin person to interpret what he just said.
[00:55:35.594 --> 00:55:39.196]  It doesn't make any sense.
[00:55:39.196 --> 00:55:40.457]  Gentlemen, big picture here.
[00:55:40.457 --> 00:55:56.544]  I know our listeners know that January 6th was a provocative action, but the listeners need to know, the viewers need to know, the left, the deep state, they admit this is a blueprint to criminalize speech, and if you go out to a demonstration and one person does something wrong out of 100,000, you go to jail too.
[00:55:59.625 --> 00:56:18.555]  If I write to you saying, I don't like what's going on in downtown Austin, somebody ought to string up city council, and I could say that, I'm a hothead, and we go to a demonstration that night and somebody breaches a barricade and throws a rock at a city council member, I'm as guilty of conspiring to cause that event as the Proud Boys were for appearing that day.
[00:56:18.555 --> 00:56:22.297]  This weaponizes speech in a way that cannot be permitted to stand.
[00:56:23.590 --> 00:56:27.314]  Alex, this weaponizes dissent to a whole nother level.
[00:56:27.314 --> 00:56:32.539]  The Proud Boys trial that we just underwent was the U.S.
[00:56:32.539 --> 00:56:38.124]  government testing its limits and where it could go.
[00:56:38.124 --> 00:56:43.309]  We did not, I mean, every single day, Alex, we came to court ready to fight.
[00:56:43.309 --> 00:56:43.850]  Hold on, Steve.
[00:56:43.850 --> 00:56:45.151]  I know you've got a lot more to say.
[00:56:45.151 --> 00:56:46.793]  Do 15 more minutes with us, guys, okay?
[00:56:47.694 --> 00:56:48.676]  Yep, absolutely.
[00:57:03.717 --> 00:57:06.839]  They've already served years in jail, solitary confinement.
[00:57:06.839 --> 00:57:07.760]  You name it, we're going to go to break.
[00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:08.501]  Start hour number two.
[00:57:08.501 --> 00:57:10.002]  Then I'll get it all in the news.
[00:57:10.002 --> 00:57:12.583]  Take your phone calls with 15 more minutes with our guest.
[00:57:12.583 --> 00:57:14.284]  Hour number two.

[00:57:24.111 --> 00:57:25.592]  It's essential in the body.
[00:57:25.592 --> 00:57:27.013]  So many people are deficient.
[00:57:27.013 --> 00:57:27.713]  This is pure.
[00:57:27.713 --> 00:57:28.854]  This is amazing.

[00:57:49.394 --> 00:57:55.658]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution is laying right there in front of you, hidden in plain view.
[00:57:55.658 --> 00:57:58.620]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[00:57:58.620 --> 00:58:08.166]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website where they admit the number one cause of cognitive disability in the world is iodine deficiency.
[00:58:08.166 --> 00:58:10.128]  The number one preventable cause
[00:58:10.848 --> 00:58:21.731]  of intellectual disability is lack of real pure iodine in the body as they bomb us with the bad halogens bromine, bromide, chlorine and so much more.
[00:58:21.731 --> 00:58:31.674]  Upwards of 2 billion people in a Lancet Medical Journal study in 2007 worldwide have cognitive disabilities because they don't have high quality iodine.
[00:58:31.674 --> 00:58:34.035]  Most iodine is bound to other elements, you don't absorb it.
[00:58:34.035 --> 00:58:37.096]  We have X3, all three types of the good iodine together
[00:58:39.700 --> 00:58:42.406]  X3 is now back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:58:42.406 --> 00:58:45.753]  It's been sold out for over six months for 25% off.

[00:58:57.722 --> 00:59:06.425]  You need to get coordinated with not only your food, but also your health supplements, because it's going to be a matter of life and death.
[00:59:06.425 --> 00:59:08.606]  So support InfoWarsTore.
[00:59:08.606 --> 00:59:17.089]  Listen, you need to put it as a priority, because you don't know, I don't know, Alex and I are telling you how late it is before midnight strikes.
[00:59:17.089 --> 00:59:21.510]  And again, magnesium is critical for your muscles and everything
[00:59:21.510 --> 00:59:22.650]  I think krill oil.
[00:59:22.650 --> 00:59:30.433]  What I'm watching right before my eyes is a composite overview of nutritional supplements that will keep you alive.
[00:59:30.433 --> 00:59:36.435]  And I would urge everyone, maybe you don't take vitamins, maybe you don't take nutritional supplements, but the day will come.
[00:59:36.435 --> 00:59:39.176]  Vitamin C and zinc, absolutely imperative for the cold.
[00:59:39.176 --> 00:59:41.357]  DNA force, absolutely imperative.
[00:59:41.357 --> 00:59:43.277]  Mineral fusion, absolutely.
[00:59:43.277 --> 00:59:46.618]  As you're drinking filtered water, a lot of it will become demineralized.
[00:59:46.618 --> 00:59:48.659]  You have to have these products.
[00:59:51.027 --> 00:59:56.952]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[01:00:12.415 --> 01:00:14.676]  All right, some stations don't carry this first five minutes.
[01:00:14.676 --> 01:00:16.517]  We got another ten minute segment after with our guest.
[01:00:16.517 --> 01:00:26.460]  I'm going to try to just go to Norm Pattis and go to Steve Metcalf, who I guess are the patron saints of lost causes, going up against this evil and just continue.
[01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:28.061]  Steve, we got caught off by a break.
[01:00:28.061 --> 01:00:31.462]  What this means to America, people that aren't constitutional lawyers, people who don't know history.
[01:00:31.462 --> 01:00:35.684]  I mean, the left even admits this is a plan to arrest their opposition.
[01:00:35.684 --> 01:00:41.526]  You have Pelosi out there months with troops at the Capitol, barbed wire around it, parading them around.
[01:00:42.446 --> 01:00:47.849]  We have Biden saying the number one terror threat is Trump supporters, when no statistics show that.
[01:00:47.849 --> 01:00:50.971]  The good news is polls show the American people don't think January 6th is important.
[01:00:50.971 --> 01:00:54.173]  94% think it's garbage.
[01:00:54.173 --> 01:00:58.195]  Their attempt at shelling this martial law has failed, but they don't care.
[01:00:58.195 --> 01:01:07.380]  They're still, in special jurisdictions, able to manipulate juries into literally turning those little jurisdictions into the Soviet Union.
[01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:10.102]  I was talking to Norm last night, I guess when you were at dinner with him,
[01:01:10.922 --> 01:01:12.725]  He made the point that D.C.
[01:01:12.725 --> 01:01:17.472]  was set up so that outside groups couldn't influence the Capitol and take it over.
[01:01:17.472 --> 01:01:23.962]  But instead now they've set it up as its own little private Potemkin village that is now taking over the rest of the country.
[01:01:23.962 --> 01:01:24.683]  So can you speak to that?
[01:01:27.139 --> 01:01:27.799]  Where to begin?
[01:01:27.799 --> 01:01:28.559]  I mean, the U.S.
[01:01:28.559 --> 01:01:36.741]  Capitol Police have now expanded in various different ways across the country than ever before and since 9-11.
[01:01:36.741 --> 01:01:44.323]  But to go back, Alex, and talk about the significance of this particular case and what this means for the future.
[01:01:44.323 --> 01:01:48.684]  This was a scenario where the government was testing its limits.
[01:01:48.684 --> 01:01:49.324]  And how so?
[01:01:50.842 --> 01:01:59.109]  Enrique Tarrio, the mastermind leader, was not in Washington DC on that day.
[01:01:59.109 --> 01:02:00.830]  That was a big leap for them.
[01:02:00.830 --> 01:02:07.316]  That was a huge scenario that they had to really fill in that void and see how they could actually prove it.
[01:02:09.730 --> 01:02:15.117]  This I believe was a test run scenario as to where they're going to go from here.
[01:02:15.117 --> 01:02:23.208]  They had to add force, they had to add someone who looked angry, someone who quote-unquote broke a window.
[01:02:23.208 --> 01:02:25.671]  That's where Dominic Pizzola came in.
[01:02:25.671 --> 01:02:26.953]  Dominic Pizzola, I
[01:02:27.814 --> 01:02:31.537]  Essentially argued before the jury was a pawn in this situation.
[01:02:31.537 --> 01:02:43.706]  He was someone who was put there that day to muddy up the rest of these guys and to make it look or to tie a link to Enrique Terrio who was not even in DC on that day.
[01:02:43.706 --> 01:02:55.134]  So now the government is armed with this scenario where the only person who was found not guilty of seditious conspiracy out of that out of those five gentlemen was my client Dominic Pizzola.
[01:02:55.134 --> 01:02:55.954]  So now they have
[01:02:56.915 --> 01:03:14.123]  Essentially been successful in being able to prove that Enrique Tarrio, who was not there in DC, who was in a hotel room in Baltimore, Maryland on that day, is capable of actually committing this crime.
[01:03:14.123 --> 01:03:15.644]  Now, this is a civil error.
[01:03:18.895 --> 01:03:27.303]  I don't know if Norm disagrees with me here, is to take over your government and to actually try to become your government.
[01:03:27.303 --> 01:03:40.136]  And there was a joke during the trial that Norm did that I thought was absolutely amazing, where he basically asked the witness, well, which one of these knuckleheads over here is going to be the Secretary of Transportation?
[01:03:40.757 --> 01:03:42.678]  Who's going to be the vice president?
[01:03:42.678 --> 01:03:44.319]  I mean, it's out.
[01:03:44.319 --> 01:03:50.082]  It's still blows my mind, Alex, that they were charging seditious conspiracy in these cases.
[01:03:50.082 --> 01:03:51.162]  Here's how they got it done.
[01:03:51.162 --> 01:03:53.744]  Three Oath Keepers and now the Proud Boys.
[01:03:53.744 --> 01:04:00.987]  The precedent is set for them to go after anybody now, even if you weren't there in Washington, D.C.
[01:04:00.987 --> 01:04:02.208]  on January 6th.
[01:04:02.208 --> 01:04:03.449]  Hold on, hold on Norms.
[01:04:03.449 --> 01:04:05.470]  We're going to break and come back and explain this.
[01:04:05.470 --> 01:04:09.432]  But the guy they say is a mastermind working for Trump wasn't even there.
[01:04:10.475 --> 01:04:17.416]  Then, the man they claim was ordered, the only one that did some violence, with a shield breaking a window, nothing compared to Andy for the left.
[01:04:17.416 --> 01:04:21.337]  Kamala Harris bells those people out all the time that shoot at people and burn buildings down.
[01:04:21.337 --> 01:04:22.197]  We're not defending that.
[01:04:22.197 --> 01:04:23.738]  Mostly peaceful protest.
[01:04:23.738 --> 01:04:28.779]  So, the low-level guy they claim they're commanding is found not guilty of being a conspiracy.
[01:04:28.779 --> 01:04:33.480]  So how is there a conspiracy if the low-level guy is not in a conspiracy with the higher-level people?
[01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:34.580]  Am I saying that right?
[01:04:35.492 --> 01:04:35.772]  Yes.
[01:04:35.772 --> 01:04:36.633]  Yes, essentially.
[01:04:36.633 --> 01:04:40.516]  And then another point is, when was this conspiracy formed?
[01:04:40.516 --> 01:04:54.989]  So, Alex, they actually argue, but didn't argue, that on the ground that day, on January 6th, there was a march from the Washington... Hold on, we'll be back in 60 seconds.
[01:04:54.989 --> 01:04:56.791]  Stay there, Steve Metcalf.
[01:04:59.718 --> 01:05:05.985]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution is laying right there in front of you, hidden in plain view.
[01:05:05.985 --> 01:05:08.968]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[01:05:08.968 --> 01:05:15.295]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website where they admit the number one cause of cognitive disability.
[01:05:15.936 --> 01:05:18.499]  In the world is iodine deficiency.
[01:05:18.499 --> 01:05:31.414]  The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability is lack of real pure iodine in the body as they bomb us with the bad halogens bromine, bromide, chlorine and so much more.
[01:05:32.054 --> 01:05:41.999]  Upwards of 2 billion people in a Lancet Medical Journal study in 2007 worldwide have cognitive disabilities because they don't have high-quality iodine.
[01:05:41.999 --> 01:05:44.360]  Most iodine is bound to other elements you don't absorb it.
[01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:50.043]  We have X3, all three types of the good iodine together that supercharges your body.
[01:05:50.043 --> 01:05:52.724]  X3 is now back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:05:52.724 --> 01:05:56.065]  It's been sold out for over six months for 25% off.
[01:05:56.065 --> 01:05:57.366]  X3, back in stock.

[01:05:58.426 --> 01:05:59.387]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:06:16.139 --> 01:06:25.565]  So this is the bizarre scene two years and four months ago.
[01:06:25.565 --> 01:06:32.769]  Pelosi parading in front of the National Guard troops mumbling under her mask.
[01:06:32.769 --> 01:06:34.370]  You can't hear a damn thing she's saying.
[01:06:35.865 --> 01:06:40.107]  Meanwhile, they would not feed the troops, they treated them like crap, made them sleep on the floor.
[01:06:40.107 --> 01:06:42.969]  This is just a group of clowns.
[01:06:42.969 --> 01:06:47.852]  So the bad news is they're trying to set up a classical tyranny with high-tech overlays.
[01:06:47.852 --> 01:06:56.357]  The good news is they're completely incompetent, and the American people see right through it.
[01:06:56.357 --> 01:06:59.859]  So, we're talking to Norm Pattis, we're talking to Steve Metcalf, both
[01:07:00.683 --> 01:07:01.504]  We're good to go.
[01:07:23.530 --> 01:07:24.592]  Kyle Rittenhouse is bad.
[01:07:24.592 --> 01:07:31.000]  When people are chasing him, shooting at him, him saying, we're going to kill you, the left says he's the bad guy.
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.103]  So it's just more of the same.
[01:07:33.103 --> 01:07:37.690]  Please finish your point than any other points you and Norm Pattis would like to make about this historic show trial.
[01:07:40.350 --> 01:07:41.391]  Absolutely Alex.
[01:07:41.391 --> 01:07:43.052]  So what does this mean?
[01:07:43.052 --> 01:07:56.759]  It means, and Norm and I saw this coming from a mile away, it means that the government can actually now prove a conspiracy based on it happening almost instantaneously or on the ground that day.
[01:07:58.072 --> 01:08:02.156]  With the Proud Boys, 10 a.m., they met up at the Washington Monument.
[01:08:02.156 --> 01:08:03.597]  They marched together.
[01:08:03.597 --> 01:08:05.478]  They stopped at a reflecting pool.
[01:08:05.478 --> 01:08:06.820]  They took a picture.
[01:08:06.820 --> 01:08:08.901]  They said a couple of prayers.
[01:08:08.901 --> 01:08:14.807]  They then walked around a little bit more, and they stopped at an area with a whole bunch of food trucks.
[01:08:16.161 --> 01:08:24.004]  Now without, now being a little bit, because there is no evidence to show that there is anything at all that happened during that time.
[01:08:24.004 --> 01:08:34.467]  There's influences and innuendos thrown out that all of a sudden this plan was hatched at that time or around that timeframe.
[01:08:34.467 --> 01:08:42.370]  And that led up to the video that you showed before, which is Ryan Samsel at the fence and Ray Epps goes and whispers in his ear.
[01:08:43.587 --> 01:08:48.031]  And then we have the footage of Reince helping with the fences ram it down.
[01:08:48.031 --> 01:08:50.633]  So let me give a parallel.
[01:08:50.633 --> 01:08:52.755]  Let me do this though Alex.
[01:08:52.755 --> 01:08:53.896]  I see time is short.
[01:08:53.896 --> 01:08:55.438]  Here's what's going to happen.
[01:08:55.438 --> 01:08:58.761]  I mean, the foundation has been laid to indict Donald Trump.
[01:08:59.321 --> 01:09:08.384]  And let's talk about something Steve and I haven't mentioned yet, a new theory of liability in a criminal court that was introduced for the first time in this case, so-called tools theory.
[01:09:08.384 --> 01:09:15.306]  If the three of us, Alex, you, Steve, and I agree to commit some unlawful act and we start running our mouth about it after the agreement and before the act,
[01:09:15.706 --> 01:09:23.749]  Each one of our statements is admissible and is evidence against one another as a statement of a co-conspirator, if that statement is in furtherance of the conspiracy.
[01:09:23.749 --> 01:09:34.533]  In this case, people the Proud Boys never knew, never met, were held to be their tools, and their statements and conduct was admitted into evidence.
[01:09:34.533 --> 01:09:41.515]  All these people you see in this crowd, all these people you see on the screen, these were deemed to be tools of the Proud Boys, influenced by them.
[01:09:41.515 --> 01:09:43.056]  Here is the significance of this.
[01:09:43.496 --> 01:09:57.807]  For Donald Trump standing on the ellipse that morning, talking to the crowd, I believe the government will now claim that Donald Trump was in a conspiracy with several people in his office to engage in seditious conspiracy to oppose the operation of the government.
[01:09:57.807 --> 01:09:58.588]  I meant to raise this.
[01:09:58.588 --> 01:10:01.490]  That's what they're talking about with this prosecutor, Smith.
[01:10:01.490 --> 01:10:06.594]  They're actually saying they're getting ready to indict Trump now with these convictions, claiming he was commanding them.
[01:10:07.910 --> 01:10:08.910]  I suspect that'll happen.
[01:10:08.910 --> 01:10:14.792]  The Proud Boys, to the degree the Proud Boys use tools, they're openly saying the Proud Boys were the President's tools.
[01:10:14.792 --> 01:10:16.173]  There's no evidence of it.
[01:10:16.173 --> 01:10:20.354]  The smartest thing that Donald Trump could do right now would be to call Steve Metcalf.
[01:10:20.354 --> 01:10:22.975]  Because all my pride is wounded.
[01:10:22.975 --> 01:10:25.936]  I didn't get an acquittal for my client on Seditious Conspiracy.
[01:10:25.936 --> 01:10:27.936]  He got one for Dominic Pozzola.
[01:10:27.936 --> 01:10:31.458]  And here's what the Trump legal team needs to be doing right now.
[01:10:31.458 --> 01:10:32.898]  They need to be finding people who
[01:10:33.118 --> 01:10:34.278]  We're good to go.
[01:11:00.208 --> 01:11:02.650]  And the special prosecutor has telegraphed that.
[01:11:02.650 --> 01:11:07.634]  So let me raise this for viewers that are as old as I am or older like you, Norm.
[01:11:07.634 --> 01:11:08.855]  I remember... Hey, wait a minute.
[01:11:08.855 --> 01:11:10.577]  Where's my cane?
[01:11:10.577 --> 01:11:13.539]  I remember in the late 80s, whenever it was, the John Gotti trial.
[01:11:13.539 --> 01:11:18.624]  And back then, the FBI had to plant microphones out in the street, hide them inside the building.
[01:11:18.624 --> 01:11:23.328]  Gotti knew they were being spied on, so they'd walk around the street and plan murders and plan stuff.
[01:11:23.328 --> 01:11:28.072]  And that was proof that they had the conspiracy, they had him planning stuff, and then they caught
[01:11:28.652 --> 01:11:30.374]  The people going out and doing the murders.
[01:11:30.374 --> 01:11:35.858]  And then they had witnesses, uh, I guess, uh, you know, Sammy the Bull or whatever his name was.
[01:11:35.858 --> 01:11:37.459]  Yes, Sammy the Bull Guerrero.
[01:11:37.459 --> 01:11:43.264]  Yes, so they had a witness, they had a witness that was there, they had audio and video, and they barely convicted him.
[01:11:43.264 --> 01:11:45.046]  They have them saying nothing!
[01:11:45.046 --> 01:11:47.368]  They have no proof, and they've just been convicted.
[01:11:48.095 --> 01:11:52.378]  This case eliminates, usually there's a staying in the law, post hoc ergo proctor hoc.
[01:11:52.378 --> 01:11:58.502]  Just because something happened before an event doesn't mean it proved the event afterward.
[01:11:58.502 --> 01:11:59.943]  You have to prove a mechanism.
[01:11:59.943 --> 01:12:02.384]  You have to tie things together with evidence.
[01:12:02.384 --> 01:12:10.490]  This case eliminated the requirement for evidence and transformed the law of conspiracy into what Steve called fairy dust.
[01:12:10.490 --> 01:12:15.713]  They can just say, hey, you said this yesterday, you did this today, kaboom!
[01:12:15.713 --> 01:12:16.654]  That's a conspiracy.
[01:12:16.934 --> 01:12:24.178]  And if they did it to the Proud Boys, with the nominal evidence they had in this case, how much more powerful will their case be against Donald Trump?
[01:12:24.178 --> 01:12:35.985]  And what will that do to the Republic, when a man who 70 million people voted for, and who tens of thousands turned up at the Capitol to protest, they chose to believe their Commander-in-Chief?
[01:12:35.985 --> 01:12:42.169]  The government says, hey... I think you got more like 80 million votes, and about a million people showed up in D.C.
[01:12:42.169 --> 01:12:42.409]  that day.
[01:12:42.469 --> 01:12:47.697]  Okay, well I don't know what the numbers were, but I mean the point is, who are the proud boys and who are the crowds supposed to believe?
[01:12:47.697 --> 01:12:49.460]  The commander-in-chief or the thief?
[01:12:49.460 --> 01:12:53.265]  And when it becomes a crime to believe your president, they've declared war on the American people.
[01:12:53.911 --> 01:12:54.471]  And they have.
[01:12:54.471 --> 01:12:56.553]  They're trying to ban the American flag now.
[01:12:56.553 --> 01:12:57.373]  Sorry, Steve Metcalf.
[01:12:57.373 --> 01:12:58.614]  Go ahead.
[01:12:58.614 --> 01:13:06.840]  Alex, you hit the nail on the head in talking about John Gotti's case and when investigations used to be investigations.
[01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:08.081]  I want you to think about this.
[01:13:08.081 --> 01:13:11.143]  I want the listeners to think about this one more time.
[01:13:11.143 --> 01:13:12.884]  The tools theory.
[01:13:12.884 --> 01:13:18.408]  This is the first time I've ever seen or heard anything like this being introduced in a conspiracy case.
[01:13:18.408 --> 01:13:19.389]  That is essentially
[01:13:20.809 --> 01:13:35.234]  One person can use another person as a tool and that tool doesn't even know what they're being used for if I wanted to basically benefit or be in furtherance of the conspiracy that I plant.
[01:13:35.234 --> 01:13:45.077]  So here we have no conspiracy whatsoever, but if another guy who's affiliated with the Proud Boys sprays something towards an officer,
[01:13:45.737 --> 01:13:46.838]  Guilt by association.
[01:14:06.667 --> 01:14:09.509]  And that's where they needed the force.
[01:14:09.509 --> 01:14:11.170]  And that's what the left does, though.
[01:14:11.170 --> 01:14:13.772]  They say anybody that wants to control the border is a white supremacist.
[01:14:13.772 --> 01:14:16.815]  Anybody that doesn't want election fraud is a white supremacist.
[01:14:16.815 --> 01:14:19.076]  Anybody that doesn't want to take a shot is a white supremacist.
[01:14:19.076 --> 01:14:20.818]  It has nothing to do with being a white supremacist.
[01:14:20.818 --> 01:14:22.259]  They just label us all as that.
[01:14:22.259 --> 01:14:34.408]  And then Biden, in June of 2001, declared all his political opposition terrorists if they believed in over 20 things, including, later, the Afghan withdrawal.
[01:14:35.649 --> 01:14:38.613]  I mean, it's just anything I don't like, you are a terrorist.
[01:14:38.613 --> 01:14:41.316]  They say white supremacists are terrorists, you're a white supremacist.
[01:14:42.153 --> 01:14:42.953]  And it's garbage.
[01:14:42.953 --> 01:14:49.516]  People need to say, you know, when you hear somebody call you a white supremacist, your first remark should be, what is it you want from me right now?
[01:14:49.516 --> 01:14:51.317]  How are you trying to shake me down?
[01:14:51.317 --> 01:14:52.577]  This land is your land.
[01:14:52.577 --> 01:14:53.877]  This land is my land.
[01:14:53.877 --> 01:14:56.278]  There's no color that's a barrier to entry.
[01:14:56.278 --> 01:14:58.719]  And I have had it up to here and beyond.
[01:14:58.719 --> 01:14:59.960]  Guys, this is too important.
[01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:00.580]  Don't hang up.
[01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:01.740]  Do 10 more minutes.
[01:15:01.740 --> 01:15:03.501]  I promise you'll be gone in like 28 after.
[01:15:03.501 --> 01:15:06.202]  And then, folks, I got tons of news on your calls coming up.
[01:15:06.202 --> 01:15:08.063]  I want to live.
[01:15:08.063 --> 01:15:08.823]  Stay right there.
[01:15:08.823 --> 01:15:09.684]  Don't leave.
[01:15:09.684 --> 01:15:10.324]  We're going to go to break.
[01:15:11.104 --> 01:15:14.427]  We'll do 10 more minutes with both these guys on the other side, let them finish their points.
[01:15:14.427 --> 01:15:16.388]  But folks, this is bone-chilling.
[01:15:16.388 --> 01:15:18.110]  And remember, I got skin in the game.
[01:15:18.110 --> 01:15:22.874]  They are admittedly trying to put me in prison, claiming I ran the quote, attack on the Capitol.
[01:15:22.874 --> 01:15:25.756]  Believe me, if I ran an attack on the Capitol, it would be a lot different.
[01:15:25.756 --> 01:15:27.398]  Plus, the Capitol doesn't run anything.
[01:15:27.398 --> 01:15:28.819]  It's just where they vote.
[01:15:28.819 --> 01:15:35.785]  It's all out at Cheyenne Mountain, and Site R, and Site M, and in Colorado Springs.
[01:15:36.405 --> 01:15:37.886]  I mean, to take over the U.S.
[01:15:37.886 --> 01:15:40.688]  government, you need about 10,000 nuclear weapons.
[01:15:40.688 --> 01:15:42.510]  I don't want to take over the government with violence.
[01:15:42.510 --> 01:15:43.911]  I want to take it back with ideas.
[01:15:43.911 --> 01:15:50.396]  The idea that I wanted this fiasco, that let the tyrants take over, is preposterous.
[01:15:50.396 --> 01:15:55.580]  The globalists have the motive, and their fingerprints are all over it, and the media is defending rehabs.
[01:15:55.580 --> 01:15:56.441]  Stay with us.
[01:15:59.343 --> 01:16:01.925]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[01:16:01.925 --> 01:16:04.166]  Please write this down and please go look this up.
[01:16:04.166 --> 01:16:06.167]  It will change your life.
[01:16:06.167 --> 01:16:14.933]  The UN admits, and the Lansing Medical Journal admits, that upwards of 2 billion people have mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities.
[01:16:14.933 --> 01:16:20.257]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[01:16:20.257 --> 01:16:21.738]  Most iodine in the environment
[01:16:22.418 --> 01:16:25.980]  is bound to other elements so your body can't absorb it.
[01:16:25.980 --> 01:16:30.442]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[01:16:30.442 --> 01:16:37.525]  And InfoWarsTore.com has the only iodine out there that actually has this type of full effect.
[01:16:37.525 --> 01:16:43.528]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3's been sold out for six months, it's very hard to produce, and it's finally back in stock.
[01:16:44.088 --> 01:16:46.450]  I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[01:16:46.450 --> 01:16:48.712]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is powerful.
[01:16:48.712 --> 01:16:50.514]  You and your family need it.
[01:16:50.514 --> 01:16:52.255]  It's 25% off back in stock.
[01:16:52.255 --> 01:16:53.196]  X3.
[01:16:53.196 --> 01:16:56.479]  Try iodine exclusively at Infowarshore.com.
[01:16:56.479 --> 01:16:59.582]  Take action now, but regardless, research is info.
[01:16:59.582 --> 01:17:05.727]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire food supply.
[01:17:06.468 --> 01:17:15.455]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element, which has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[01:17:15.455 --> 01:17:18.298]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[01:17:18.298 --> 01:17:21.100]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:30.127]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally keep the soil rich with iodine.
[01:17:30.127 --> 01:17:39.956]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day, derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the Earth's surface.
[01:17:40.536 --> 01:17:46.461]  Our InfoWars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[01:17:46.461 --> 01:17:52.525]  Pure nascent iodine, stabilized in an activated triiodine form.

[01:17:59.284 --> 01:18:05.267]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move against Tucker Carlson and take him off the air.
[01:18:05.267 --> 01:18:07.928]  People said, no way, he's the most powerful thing that ever happened.
[01:18:07.928 --> 01:18:10.109]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[01:18:10.109 --> 01:18:12.710]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him.
[01:18:12.710 --> 01:18:15.932]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[01:18:15.932 --> 01:18:17.692]  It's the same thing with Infowars.
[01:18:17.692 --> 01:18:24.316]  But Infowars is not owned by Fox, or controlled by George Soros, or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[01:18:24.316 --> 01:18:27.097]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[01:18:28.089 --> 01:18:30.190]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[01:18:30.190 --> 01:18:34.814]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[01:18:34.814 --> 01:18:38.536]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[01:18:38.536 --> 01:18:41.678]  So I want to thank you for your support and encourage viewers and listeners to understand.
[01:18:41.678 --> 01:18:44.240]  Please don't take InfoWars for granted.
[01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:45.581]  We're barely hanging on.
[01:18:45.581 --> 01:18:51.365]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support while getting great products at the same time at InfoWarsTore.com.

[01:18:59.010 --> 01:19:05.674]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mug shot because they knew that that would help Trump.
[01:19:05.674 --> 01:19:07.615]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[01:19:07.615 --> 01:19:09.116]  We were waiting for the mug shot.
[01:19:09.116 --> 01:19:11.937]  We learned today they wouldn't have it, so we've made our own.
[01:19:11.937 --> 01:19:13.919]  And it says political prisoner.
[01:19:14.719 --> 01:19:16.681]  With an image of President Trump.
[01:19:16.681 --> 01:19:19.123]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[01:19:19.123 --> 01:19:21.264]  It'll be shipping out to you in one week.
[01:19:21.264 --> 01:19:26.629]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front there in a mug shot.
[01:19:26.629 --> 01:19:27.850]  Jail background.
[01:19:27.850 --> 01:19:28.891]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[01:19:28.891 --> 01:19:33.034]  It says InfoWars.com on the back of the shirt.
[01:19:33.034 --> 01:19:34.636]  We also have Alex Jones for President.
[01:19:34.636 --> 01:19:35.656]  No, I'm not running for President.
[01:19:35.656 --> 01:19:38.218]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt.
[01:19:38.218 --> 01:19:38.999]  Red, white, and blue.
[01:19:38.999 --> 01:19:39.860]  Alex Jones for President.
[01:19:40.540 --> 01:19:43.381]  2024, it's a fun conversational piece and a limited edition shirt.
[01:19:43.381 --> 01:19:45.262]  Great way to fund the operation.
[01:19:45.262 --> 01:20:00.006]  So get your Alex Jones for President and Trump mugshot shirts at infowarestore.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:20:00.006 --> 01:20:05.888]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:10.071 --> 01:20:12.534]  Final segment, the two lawyers.
[01:20:32.193 --> 01:20:36.935]  The patron saint of lost causes, the son of lost cause, in the District of St.
[01:20:36.935 --> 01:20:41.736]  Mordor, in D.C., for another show trial.
[01:20:41.736 --> 01:20:55.661]  Norm, we were talking last night, and just repeat what you said, you said it very eloquently, explaining, and of course I know the history, it's accurate, but I mean, you said it better than I would, explain the legalese why they have the District of Columbia.
[01:20:57.119 --> 01:21:05.526]  And how that was set up so that the states couldn't override it, and how that's been used to reverse it, and how it's literally setting up its own little kingdom.
[01:21:05.526 --> 01:21:11.591]  Yeah, so the District of Columbia is one of the few original federal territories established by the Constitution.
[01:21:11.591 --> 01:21:23.040]  It was initially, I believe, a five-square-mile area, and it was designed to not fall under the influence of a particular state, to be independent, so that no state would have too much influence on the federal government.
[01:21:23.380 --> 01:21:28.925]  At that time, the balance of federalism was tipped vastly in the direction of the states and they had more power.
[01:21:28.925 --> 01:21:32.167]  The federal government was supposed to be one of enumerated and limited powers.
[01:21:32.167 --> 01:21:42.516]  Over time, as we all know, the federal government has become an instrument of a deep state, quite frankly, a sense of universalism and has acquired incredible powers over us and is seeking even more.
[01:21:42.516 --> 01:21:45.318]  And the result in this district is that
[01:21:45.698 --> 01:21:46.859]  It's a company town.
[01:21:46.859 --> 01:21:52.362]  Almost everybody here either works for government, is a lobbyist, serves the government, serves government interests.
[01:21:52.362 --> 01:21:57.804]  You see on license plates here, D.C., you know, taxation without representation, we're not a state.
[01:21:57.804 --> 01:21:59.065]  You don't need to be a state.
[01:21:59.065 --> 01:22:05.468]  You control the whole frickin' country and money's flowing in here like blood into a satanic vessel.
[01:22:05.468 --> 01:22:07.630]  It's the richest city in the U.S.
[01:22:07.630 --> 01:22:08.010]  by far.
[01:22:09.331 --> 01:22:16.013]  And so, you know, we knew we were going to have problems on our hands when we couldn't get the case moved out of D.C.
[01:22:16.013 --> 01:22:18.974]  This is a company town, and the business of Washington, D.C.
[01:22:18.974 --> 01:22:20.635]  is the business of government.
[01:22:20.635 --> 01:22:28.778]  And so, you know, one of the things that was so moving to me in this experience is I took my first tour of the Capitol, and they show you a film.
[01:22:28.778 --> 01:22:30.438]  E pluribus unum, they say.
[01:22:30.438 --> 01:22:31.359]  Out of one many.
[01:22:31.359 --> 01:22:33.679]  This is where the people come to become one.
[01:22:33.679 --> 01:22:35.400]  Well, this is only supposed to be a forum.
[01:22:35.740 --> 01:22:38.621]  That you visit to establish laws to take home.
[01:22:38.621 --> 01:22:50.968]  When people made it a home of their own, they've decided that that home is the metropole of a giant plantation and that we the people in our various states and locations exist to serve it.
[01:22:50.968 --> 01:22:53.069]  That's never been the American way.
[01:22:53.069 --> 01:22:55.150]  And I repeat Jefferson's word.
[01:22:55.150 --> 01:22:57.551]  When the people fear government, there is tyranny.
[01:22:57.551 --> 01:22:59.652]  When the government fears people, there is liberty.
[01:22:59.972 --> 01:23:07.117]  And I'm proud to have represented the Proud Boys, and to those Proud Boy affiliates and members out there, you'll know what I say when I say the following.
[01:23:07.117 --> 01:23:08.058]  Uhuru.
[01:23:08.058 --> 01:23:09.279]  That's their greeting.
[01:23:09.279 --> 01:23:11.320]  And it's Swahili for freedom.
[01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:14.623]  And that has been the gamble of American history throughout our lives.
[01:23:14.623 --> 01:23:19.847]  I love how they're white supremacists whose motto is a Swahili word for freedom.
[01:23:20.982 --> 01:23:23.284]  Oh, and of course, Enrique Tarrio.
[01:23:23.284 --> 01:23:24.745]  It couldn't be said enough at trial.
[01:23:24.745 --> 01:23:30.548]  He's an Afro-Cuban, and many of the witnesses we called on behalf of the Proud Boys were persons of color.
[01:23:30.548 --> 01:23:31.729]  We had Hispanic witnesses.
[01:23:31.729 --> 01:23:33.110]  We had Jewish witnesses.
[01:23:33.110 --> 01:23:39.134]  But no, they're white supremacists, and it's because you're a white... That's an easy way to demonize dissent.
[01:23:39.134 --> 01:23:43.057]  Call somebody a bad name, and they're afraid to step up, step forward.
[01:23:43.057 --> 01:23:48.300]  I don't know what your perspective is on that, Steve, but I found we were able to eliminate that rhetoric, I think.
[01:23:48.300 --> 01:23:49.661]  We were, but we were...
[01:23:51.042 --> 01:23:56.904]  We stepped into this equation at trial at such an unfair advantage.
[01:23:56.904 --> 01:24:05.967]  The terminology, or just the word insurrection or insurrectionist, being used and splashed across the country for two years.
[01:24:06.727 --> 01:24:24.680]  Really set the stage, and then the terminology of white supremacy being linked to the Proud Boys is something that actually stuck with people, and it resonated with people, and made people in DC actually fear the Proud Boys, or fear some of these men.
[01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:29.984]  So when the media, we lost the media right off the bat for the last two years.
[01:24:29.984 --> 01:24:33.267]  The left did an amazing job at demonizing these men.
[01:24:33.267 --> 01:24:34.568]  Oh, believe me, they didn't Sandy Hook.
[01:24:34.568 --> 01:24:35.609]  They try you in the press.
[01:24:36.309 --> 01:24:42.010]  Then the judge finds you guilty, then you can't defend yourself, and they testified that I sent people to pee on graves.
[01:24:42.010 --> 01:24:43.250]  No evidence!
[01:24:43.250 --> 01:24:46.011]  Talk about defamation, just completely made up!
[01:24:46.011 --> 01:24:55.832]  They gave an FBI agent who I never said his name, never showed a photo of him, didn't know who he was until he sued me, 90 plus million dollars!
[01:24:55.832 --> 01:25:00.333]  And then the January 6th committee!
[01:25:00.333 --> 01:25:04.734]  I don't believe in coincidences, and Norm and I kept having these conversations back and forth.
[01:25:05.777 --> 01:25:11.782]  Alex, the day that we started picking the jury was December 19th.
[01:25:11.782 --> 01:25:23.471]  They set this whole thing up at the January 6th committee that weekend, going into that week of December 19th, that they were coming out with the decision that was going to be against Trump.
[01:25:23.471 --> 01:25:28.375]  Every day we had to go in and make a new motion for a mistrial, basically stating that we were so prejudiced.
[01:25:28.375 --> 01:25:28.796]  That's right.
[01:25:28.796 --> 01:25:31.258]  They ended their show committee right as the show trial started.
[01:25:31.798 --> 01:25:53.626]  Well, and then get this, Alex, the very day that the jury goes to deliberations, that morning, Joe Biden announced his presidential campaign, and what do you think he had as an image on the presidential campaign but a smoldering Capitol, and the sign of unrest there, and his promise to save democracy, which was the very theme that the prosecutors used in their closing statements.
[01:25:53.626 --> 01:25:53.886]  No, we're good.
[01:26:24.746 --> 01:26:29.147]  Well, they may try, but I think patriotism begins at home.
[01:26:29.147 --> 01:26:31.088]  And it's not a crime to believe in this country.
[01:26:31.088 --> 01:26:33.228]  It shouldn't be a crime to read the Constitution.
[01:26:33.228 --> 01:26:37.709]  It shouldn't be a crime to reach across the fence and shake your neighbor's hand and say, I believe in freedom.
[01:26:37.709 --> 01:26:38.349]  Do you?
[01:26:38.349 --> 01:26:44.050]  And I think we, the people, need to form powerful associations with one another and with shows like InfoWars.
[01:26:44.050 --> 01:26:47.731]  And we need to go, and people do need to support the InfoWars.
[01:26:47.731 --> 01:26:48.191]  People do
[01:26:48.291 --> 01:26:48.831]  I don't know.
[01:27:05.577 --> 01:27:08.819]  I predicted on March 8th he'd be fired within two months.
[01:27:08.819 --> 01:27:15.764]  And now there's a new video that he cut weeks ago for a big summit in Europe that he's not at predicting he'd be fired.
[01:27:15.764 --> 01:27:17.865]  I'll play that next segment.
[01:27:17.865 --> 01:27:22.048]  And I know exactly what happened with Tucker, but I'm not allowed to get into it, but you were dead on.
[01:27:22.048 --> 01:27:23.489]  Where's he going to resurface, Alex?
[01:27:23.489 --> 01:27:24.169]  I'm dying to know.
[01:27:24.169 --> 01:27:24.930]  Are you able to say?
[01:27:24.930 --> 01:27:30.974]  People shouldn't be holding their breath for him to go to
[01:27:32.438 --> 01:27:37.182]  Patrick Mendamid, or whatever his name is, nice guy, or Newsmax.
[01:27:37.182 --> 01:27:38.963]  They shouldn't be allowed around.
[01:27:38.963 --> 01:27:40.385]  Let me end with one note.
[01:27:40.385 --> 01:27:43.587]  I think people need to join the Fully Informed Jury Association.
[01:27:43.587 --> 01:27:51.854]  We need to bring back jury nullification in the United States, and we need jurors to be able to decide not just the facts, but whether the law is being justly applied.
[01:27:51.854 --> 01:27:54.236]  I was stopped any number of times in my closing argument.
[01:27:54.236 --> 01:27:57.599]  There was even a disruptor in the gallery who was removed by the marshal.
[01:27:57.899 --> 01:28:03.104]  And I argued as close to the edge of nullification as I could and was stopped repeatedly by the judge.
[01:28:03.104 --> 01:28:10.551]  There was a time in this country when jurors got to decide not just the facts before them, but whether the law was appropriately applied.
[01:28:10.551 --> 01:28:12.993]  That's right, the citizens had a veto.
[01:28:12.993 --> 01:28:14.275]  Only 30 seconds left.
[01:28:14.275 --> 01:28:15.776]  Closing comments, Steve Metcalf.
[01:28:15.776 --> 01:28:16.597]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:28:17.623 --> 01:28:18.604]  Absolutely, Alex.
[01:28:18.604 --> 01:28:19.444]  Always a pleasure.
[01:28:19.444 --> 01:28:22.466]  It's always a pleasure to be near Norm.
[01:28:22.466 --> 01:28:31.432]  We need to have the facts of this case and the transcripts of this case actually exposed and out there for everybody.
[01:28:31.432 --> 01:28:34.194]  The appeal on this case is going to be massive.
[01:28:34.194 --> 01:28:39.137]  And that tool theory is going to change American jurisprudence forever.
[01:28:39.137 --> 01:28:40.779]  I firmly believe that.
[01:28:40.779 --> 01:28:43.300]  And this is only the beginning of the fight right here.
[01:28:43.300 --> 01:28:47.323]  And we have to be very vigilant and know what's coming because this is
[01:28:48.124 --> 01:28:48.946]  They're not stopping.
[01:28:48.946 --> 01:28:49.467]  They're only building.
[01:28:49.467 --> 01:28:50.348]  Steve Madcap, real quick.
[01:28:50.348 --> 01:28:50.909]  Do you have a Twitter?
[01:28:50.909 --> 01:28:51.650]  Where do people find you?
[01:28:53.177 --> 01:28:55.278]  Metcalfe Law, NYC.
[01:28:55.278 --> 01:28:56.959]  I do have a Twitter.
[01:28:56.959 --> 01:28:58.919]  I do have an Instagram.
[01:28:58.919 --> 01:29:01.501]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[01:29:01.501 --> 01:29:03.761]  Please write this down and please go look this up.
[01:29:03.761 --> 01:29:05.762]  It will change your life.
[01:29:05.762 --> 01:29:14.526]  The UN admits, and the Lansing Medical Journal admits, that upwards of 2 billion people have mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities.
[01:29:14.526 --> 01:29:19.848]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[01:29:19.848 --> 01:29:21.329]  Most iodine in the environment
[01:29:22.009 --> 01:29:25.572]  is bound to other elements so your body can't absorb it.
[01:29:25.572 --> 01:29:30.015]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[01:29:30.015 --> 01:29:37.101]  And InfoWarsTore.com has the only iodine out there that actually has this type of full effect.
[01:29:37.101 --> 01:29:43.126]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3's been sold out for six months, it's very hard to produce, and it's finally back in stock.
[01:29:43.686 --> 01:29:46.047]  I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[01:29:46.047 --> 01:29:48.308]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is powerful.
[01:29:48.308 --> 01:29:50.108]  You and your family need it.
[01:29:50.108 --> 01:29:51.849]  It's 25% off back in stock.
[01:29:51.849 --> 01:29:56.051]  X3 Tri-Iodine, exclusively at Infowarshore.com.
[01:29:56.051 --> 01:29:58.732]  Take action now, but regardless, research is info.
[01:29:58.732 --> 01:30:04.394]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution, is laying right there in front of you, hidden in plain view.
[01:30:05.034 --> 01:30:07.997]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[01:30:07.997 --> 01:30:17.545]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website, where they admit the number one cause of cognitive disability in the world is iodine deficiency.
[01:30:17.545 --> 01:30:30.476]  The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability is lack of real, pure iodine in the body, as they bomb us with the bad halogens, bromine, bromide, chlorine, and so much more.
[01:30:31.116 --> 01:30:41.040]  Upwards of 2 billion people in a Lancet Medical Journal study in 2007 worldwide have cognitive disabilities because they don't have high quality iodine.
[01:30:41.040 --> 01:30:43.421]  Most iodine is bound to other elements you don't absorb it.
[01:30:43.421 --> 01:30:46.462]  We have X3, all three types of good iodine together.
[01:30:47.222 --> 01:30:49.085]  That supercharges your body.
[01:30:49.085 --> 01:30:51.788]  X3 is now back in stock at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:30:51.788 --> 01:30:55.113]  It's been sold out for over six months for 25% off.
[01:30:55.113 --> 01:30:56.415]  X3 back in stock.
[01:30:56.415 --> 01:30:57.476]  Take action now.
[01:30:57.476 --> 01:30:58.578]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:30:58.578 --> 01:31:02.102]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[01:31:06.857 --> 01:31:08.198]  I want you all to know something.
[01:31:08.198 --> 01:31:10.140]  Alex Jones was right.
[01:31:10.140 --> 01:31:13.702]  Alex is right about far more than he's wrong.
[01:31:13.702 --> 01:31:16.444]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[01:31:16.444 --> 01:31:21.068]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down.
[01:31:21.068 --> 01:31:23.270]  Alex Jones was right.
[01:31:23.270 --> 01:31:26.812]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[01:31:26.812 --> 01:31:30.255]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[01:31:30.515 --> 01:31:33.396]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[01:31:33.396 --> 01:31:34.417]  Years ago.
[01:31:34.417 --> 01:31:36.498]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax.
[01:31:36.498 --> 01:31:38.499]  Not for a second.
[01:31:38.499 --> 01:31:41.020]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[01:31:41.020 --> 01:31:43.481]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[01:31:43.481 --> 01:31:46.603]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[01:31:46.603 --> 01:31:51.245]  That's why the globalists hate me, is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[01:31:58.766 --> 01:32:04.389]  I want to thank all of you over the years who have supported InfoWars financially and with word of mouth and prayer.
[01:32:04.389 --> 01:32:11.993]  All the success that we've had together against the Globalists and the fact that we're not caught flat-footed during their major takeover is because of you.
[01:32:11.993 --> 01:32:14.195]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.
[01:32:14.955 --> 01:32:22.018]  I just want to thank you all for buying products at InfoWarsTore.com, like books, and films, and supplements, and water filtration, air filtration, and so much more.
[01:32:22.018 --> 01:32:35.224]  But for those of you that want to actually give us a straight donation so we get almost 100% of the money to fund our operation during this critical time, go to InfoWarsTore.com, and right at the top, you'll see a link to make a straight donation.
[01:32:35.224 --> 01:32:37.845]  A one-time donation of $5, $10, $50, or a recurring donation you can cancel anytime.
[01:32:41.266 --> 01:32:42.687]  I want to thank all you that have donated.
[01:32:42.687 --> 01:32:56.232]  I want to encourage those of you out there that want to support Freedom to take action now and be part of the global awakening, the new renaissance that's countering the Great Reset by going to InfoWarsTore.com and clicking on the donate button and giving today.

[01:32:59.633 --> 01:33:05.516]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:14.754 --> 01:33:19.716]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[01:33:38.257 --> 01:33:45.541]  Alright, I just spent an hour on January 6th because it's all come to a head now.
[01:33:45.541 --> 01:33:52.825]  And we're not going to lie to you, it's a big victory for the police state, for the weaponized judiciary.
[01:33:52.825 --> 01:33:58.228]  We're having a lot of victories as well in the hearts and minds, but the enemy controls the bureaucracy and the infrastructure.
[01:33:58.228 --> 01:34:02.550]  They're attacking us at every level, annihilating our borders, shipping in drugs, attacking our children.
[01:34:04.110 --> 01:34:12.258]  Persecuting people that defend themselves, the case here in Austin, where the man aims an AK-47 at him, and the veteran shoots him.
[01:34:12.258 --> 01:34:14.200]  Veteran, no criminal record.
[01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:16.662]  Hell, war hero.
[01:34:16.662 --> 01:34:19.185]  Active duty, having to have another job just to pay the bills.
[01:34:21.527 --> 01:34:22.848]  You're supposed to let somebody point an AK-47 at you.
[01:34:22.848 --> 01:34:27.109]  Kind of like this Uber Eats driver last week in Florida.
[01:34:27.109 --> 01:34:28.490]  He done like 30 deliveries.
[01:34:28.490 --> 01:34:30.611]  Last delivery of the night, 2 a.m.
[01:34:30.611 --> 01:34:35.733]  MS-13 guy takes him, steals his money, executes him, dismembers him.
[01:34:35.733 --> 01:34:39.995]  I guess when MS-13 pointed a gun at him, he should have not fought back.
[01:34:39.995 --> 01:34:40.535]  I guess he didn't.
[01:34:40.535 --> 01:34:43.756]  He got killed.
[01:34:43.756 --> 01:34:50.519]  And we now know what happened with this case of this mentally ill, schizophrenic black man who had been arrested 40 times, more than 20 of them,
[01:34:51.803 --> 01:34:54.765]  For aggravated assault and battery.
[01:34:54.765 --> 01:34:59.727]  40 arrests.
[01:34:59.727 --> 01:35:03.549]  And it turns out, the full video, we can show it, I guess we'll get to it next hour.
[01:35:03.549 --> 01:35:12.854]  A black guy, a Hispanic guy, and a white guy, when he's threatening to kill him, we have all these videos of him now, it turns out there were like warnings by in the subway, warnings online.
[01:35:12.854 --> 01:35:16.336]  If you see the Michael Jackson impersonator, look out.
[01:35:16.336 --> 01:35:20.138]  This guy starts charging him, pushing him, attacking him, saying, I'll kill you.
[01:35:21.471 --> 01:35:25.193]  I don't care if I'm going to die.
[01:35:25.193 --> 01:35:34.518]  And so the black guy starts wrestling him because he got in his face, and the white guy jumps in to help the black guy, and now he's a white supremacist that just murdered a black guy for fun.
[01:35:34.518 --> 01:35:41.641]  No, he's a big, powerful, 6'3", schizophrenic.
[01:35:41.641 --> 01:35:45.603]  And I'll tell you, I've been to New York a lot, and it's always been bad.
[01:35:45.603 --> 01:35:47.905]  When I was a kid, we went there, it was super dangerous.
[01:35:47.905 --> 01:35:49.886]  Giuliani, not a perfect guy, but he cleaned it up.
[01:35:50.703 --> 01:35:53.444]  And since then, I'm a tough guy.
[01:35:53.444 --> 01:35:56.004]  I mean, I'm not the toughest around, but I don't want trouble.
[01:35:56.004 --> 01:35:59.965]  I'm not getting on the New York subway for all the money in the world.
[01:35:59.965 --> 01:36:03.786]  It's a frickin' underground lunatic asylum.
[01:36:03.786 --> 01:36:14.688]  There's human feces and needles and crazy people, black, white, running around like maniacs.
[01:36:14.688 --> 01:36:16.469]  And this guy was arrested 40 times.
[01:36:23.328 --> 01:36:29.453]  And yeah, you put somebody in a chokehold, sometimes they never wake up.
[01:36:29.453 --> 01:36:43.483]  But AOC comes out and says, it's a white supremacist attack, he was killed because he was black and poor, and calls for demonstrations, and even the black mayor says, stop it, you don't know the facts, stop it.
[01:36:43.483 --> 01:36:46.145]  But they want another George Floyd, folks.
[01:36:46.145 --> 01:36:47.426]  They want another George Floyd.
[01:36:47.426 --> 01:36:49.648]  Nobody's happy, the schizophrenic's dead.
[01:36:50.845 --> 01:37:00.591]  They got rid in the 80s of the funding for state mental institutions and now anybody that's been in a big city knows it's an open-air mental institution.
[01:37:00.591 --> 01:37:05.674]  Every week or so, I have to dodge some crazy schizophrenic running across the road.
[01:37:05.674 --> 01:37:10.957]  You'll see a black man run across the road, a white man run across the road, an old lady, an old white lady.
[01:37:10.957 --> 01:37:14.919]  Just a couple days ago, I'm driving down, Ben White.
[01:37:15.888 --> 01:37:31.236]  I'm driving down 71 in the middle of Austin, 70 miles an hour is the speed limit, and a naked woman, looked like she was about 65 years old, runs across the road in front of like three cars in front of me.
[01:37:31.236 --> 01:37:35.358]  They almost hit her.
[01:37:35.358 --> 01:37:39.920]  We literally live in a lunatic asylum.
[01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:40.981]  This morning I go get gas.
[01:37:42.236 --> 01:37:43.356]  In the nice area of Austin.
[01:37:43.356 --> 01:37:45.357]  It's not super nice, but it's a nice area.
[01:37:45.357 --> 01:37:51.239]  And I step out of my car, there's a pile of human feces right there.
[01:37:51.239 --> 01:38:00.022]  I decide this morning that I want some food, so I pull over at a breakfast place.
[01:38:00.022 --> 01:38:03.363]  And there's another pile of crap by the door.
[01:38:03.363 --> 01:38:10.105]  It's a lunatic asylum.
[01:38:10.105 --> 01:38:11.426]  It's a open-air,
[01:38:12.409 --> 01:38:14.651]  Lunatic asylum.
[01:38:14.651 --> 01:38:16.272]  You say, why do you live in Austin?
[01:38:16.272 --> 01:38:20.055]  Well, my family's been here since the 1820s.
[01:38:20.055 --> 01:38:22.057]  And this is where the infrastructure is built.
[01:38:22.057 --> 01:38:25.339]  And I don't have the money to move this someplace.
[01:38:25.339 --> 01:38:27.421]  Believe me, I want to.
[01:38:27.421 --> 01:38:28.422]  Because it's dangerous.
[01:38:28.422 --> 01:38:29.642]  I still love the town.
[01:38:29.642 --> 01:38:32.665]  I grew up here.
[01:38:32.665 --> 01:38:34.026]  But yeah, we're looking.
[01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:38.661]  That's why I've got offers in Florida to work with somebody else.
[01:38:38.661 --> 01:38:41.563]  I've got offers, a lot of offers.
[01:38:41.563 --> 01:38:46.626]  But I'm loyal to the crew and I'm going to stay here as long as I can.
[01:38:46.626 --> 01:38:50.048]  But it's so sad to see the fall of your city.
[01:38:50.048 --> 01:38:54.690]  And Austin is a paradise compared to New York.
[01:38:54.690 --> 01:38:57.552]  I was in New York twice the last two years.
[01:38:57.552 --> 01:39:01.234]  And man, it is surreal.
[01:39:01.234 --> 01:39:03.155]  Needles, garbage, feces.
[01:39:04.403 --> 01:39:06.664]  And gay pride flags everywhere.
[01:39:06.664 --> 01:39:15.569]  And just, I mean, I was there about a year ago to be on a big podcast.
[01:39:15.569 --> 01:39:21.511]  I was on Michael Malice's podcast and I was on Schultz's podcast, the comedian.
[01:39:21.511 --> 01:39:28.035]  And I thought I was in the twilight zone.
[01:39:28.035 --> 01:39:30.576]  Piss, crap, needles, everywhere.
[01:39:33.422 --> 01:39:39.127]  Bulls of piss everywhere, crazy people running around like zombies, and little kids marching with rainbow flags.
[01:39:39.127 --> 01:39:41.770]  Last time I was there it was like Gay Pride Month or something.
[01:39:41.770 --> 01:39:45.954]  It was just like, I'm living in a frickin' twilight zone, man.
[01:39:45.954 --> 01:39:49.317]  These are cursed cities.
[01:39:49.317 --> 01:39:50.658]  And I've got all this news I want to hit.
[01:39:50.658 --> 01:39:51.699]  We'll take calls next hour.
[01:39:51.699 --> 01:39:58.005]  We'll get the number out next segment, but this is a planned takedown of civilization.
[01:39:59.784 --> 01:40:23.926]  I got a bunch of articles I'm gonna hit next segment but let's play this clip I mentioned it in pre-recorded message Tucker Carlson predicted his own ouster from Fox News this week in Europe in Hungary they're having CPAC Europe and so he taped this it looks like the Thursday before he was fired so about two weeks ago there's two weeks ago exactly now and
[01:40:25.976 --> 01:40:27.016]  It's prophetic.
[01:40:27.016 --> 01:40:29.737]  He says, if I'm fired, next time I'll be with you.
[01:40:29.737 --> 01:40:31.558]  So this, I told you this will all come out.
[01:40:31.558 --> 01:40:32.819]  I mean, Tucker knew it was coming.
[01:40:32.819 --> 01:40:34.999]  He wasn't sure at the exact same time.
[01:40:34.999 --> 01:40:36.300]  He came over to visit me.
[01:40:36.300 --> 01:40:38.781]  He came over to the house.
[01:40:38.781 --> 01:40:45.783]  And, you know, on Thanksgiving, we had a long conversation, a couple hour conversation.
[01:40:45.783 --> 01:40:47.324]  But that's all a private conversation.
[01:40:47.324 --> 01:40:49.565]  Our other conversations are private.
[01:40:49.565 --> 01:40:52.566]  But he knew it was coming, and that just makes him cooler.
[01:40:53.356 --> 01:40:54.296]  Because he didn't back down.
[01:40:54.296 --> 01:40:59.537]  I'm not going to say why he got fired, other than to say everything he did is why he got fired.
[01:40:59.537 --> 01:41:07.719]  And like Roger Stone astutely said a week ago, he got fired because they were scared of what he was going to do next.
[01:41:07.719 --> 01:41:08.939]  Same reason they want me off air.
[01:41:08.939 --> 01:41:09.819]  But here's the deal.
[01:41:09.819 --> 01:41:13.280]  I don't work for Spotify or Fox News.
[01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:15.841]  I got my own operation.
[01:41:15.841 --> 01:41:17.601]  The only reason this dog hunts is because of you.

[01:41:51.138 --> 01:41:52.600]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:59.405]  Let's go to break with Tucker Carlson predicting his firing in his last days at Fox that just aired.
[01:41:59.405 --> 01:42:00.647]  Here it is.
[01:42:00.647 --> 01:42:04.370]  Greetings to CPAC Hungary and to all you Americans in the audience.
[01:42:04.370 --> 01:42:05.971]  You are very brave.
[01:42:05.971 --> 01:42:09.314]  You have landed up on one of Samantha Power's lists.
[01:42:09.314 --> 01:42:11.016]  The State Department is keeping track.
[01:42:11.016 --> 01:42:12.437]  You went to a forbidden country.
[01:42:13.399 --> 01:42:14.820]  I wish I was there in Budapest.
[01:42:14.820 --> 01:42:19.722]  If I ever get fired and have some time and can't leave, I will be there with you.
[01:42:19.722 --> 01:42:21.482]  But in the meantime, Godspeed.
[01:42:21.482 --> 01:42:32.607]  We are thinking of you and cheering you on.
[01:42:32.607 --> 01:42:34.608]  Are you gonna lay down and take it?
[01:42:34.608 --> 01:42:36.588]  Because here's the bottom line.
[01:42:36.588 --> 01:42:39.950]  Laying down and taking it only makes it worse.
[01:42:39.950 --> 01:42:42.911]  I don't agree with the Japanese that if rape is inevitable, enjoy it.
[01:42:44.039 --> 01:42:48.720]  If rape's inevitable, bite their dick off.
[01:42:48.720 --> 01:42:51.161]  That's what I tell my daughters.
[01:42:51.161 --> 01:42:53.002]  Somebody attacks you, kill them.
[01:42:53.002 --> 01:43:00.164]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[01:43:00.164 --> 01:43:03.185]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[01:43:03.185 --> 01:43:05.485]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[01:43:05.485 --> 01:43:09.427]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[01:43:09.427 --> 01:43:13.368]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[01:43:14.798 --> 01:43:18.341]  They really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[01:43:18.341 --> 01:43:26.167]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[01:43:27.176 --> 01:43:30.819]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[01:43:30.819 --> 01:43:36.603]  I want to encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[01:43:36.603 --> 01:43:37.543]  I know you spread the word.
[01:43:37.543 --> 01:43:38.464]  I know you pray for us.
[01:43:38.464 --> 01:43:39.064]  That's wonderful.
[01:43:39.064 --> 01:43:39.625]  Keep doing it.
[01:43:39.625 --> 01:43:46.690]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[01:43:46.690 --> 01:43:47.871]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[01:43:48.511 --> 01:43:50.232]  There is a war for the future happening right now.
[01:43:50.232 --> 01:43:53.694]  There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny, our children's destinies.
[01:43:53.694 --> 01:43:57.376]  And that war is something that we can win, but it takes dedication, it takes commitment.
[01:44:11.843 --> 01:44:22.589]  That's why I ask listeners respectfully to go to InfoWarStore.com and buy great products that will enrich and empower your life while keeping us on air at the very same time.

[01:44:44.620 --> 01:44:49.962]  You've been watching for years, you've been listening for years, but you've never taken the step to go to InfoWarsTore.
[01:44:49.962 --> 01:44:52.823]  These are great products that really work and are amazing.
[01:44:52.823 --> 01:44:54.184]  Plus, they keep us on air.
[01:44:54.184 --> 01:44:55.685]  So again, please take action.

[01:46:10.196 --> 01:46:13.738]  Alex is right about far more things wrong.
[01:46:13.738 --> 01:46:16.659]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[01:46:16.659 --> 01:46:21.101]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down.
[01:46:21.101 --> 01:46:23.302]  Alex Jones was right.
[01:46:23.302 --> 01:46:26.844]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[01:46:26.844 --> 01:46:30.286]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[01:46:30.546 --> 01:46:33.428]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[01:46:33.428 --> 01:46:34.448]  Years ago.
[01:46:34.448 --> 01:46:36.550]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax.
[01:46:36.550 --> 01:46:38.531]  Not for a second.
[01:46:38.531 --> 01:46:41.053]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[01:46:41.053 --> 01:46:43.514]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[01:46:43.514 --> 01:46:46.636]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[01:46:46.636 --> 01:46:48.197]  That's why the globalists hate me.
[01:46:48.197 --> 01:46:51.279]  It's because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[01:46:59.508 --> 01:47:05.415]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:25.376 --> 01:47:50.513]  Ghost riders in the sky An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way When all at once a mighty bunch of red-eyed cows he saw Plowing through the ragged sky
[01:47:55.503 --> 01:48:00.587]  All right, let's hit the big news right now.
[01:48:17.950 --> 01:48:23.675]  Then I'll give the number out to take your phone calls next hour on any topic you want to raise, any question you want to bring up.
[01:48:23.675 --> 01:48:28.238]  All I ask for is first-time callers.
[01:48:28.238 --> 01:48:36.364]  And I gave out a quiz earlier that we're also going to be getting to.
[01:48:36.364 --> 01:48:44.271]  And so you can bring up any topic you want, but all I ask you to do is first try to give me the answer to the quiz.
[01:48:44.271 --> 01:48:46.953]  And it's my opinion, but it's my view of what this means.
[01:48:50.814 --> 01:48:59.542]  And whoever wins it gets a free t-shirt, either a Trump political prisoner shirt or an Alex Jones for President shirt.
[01:48:59.542 --> 01:49:03.946]  Just give us your address, the size you want, we'll mail it to you.
[01:49:03.946 --> 01:49:12.675]  We'll also throw in a copy of my book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, for whoever answers this question.
[01:49:13.865 --> 01:49:15.787]  This is a very important question.
[01:49:15.787 --> 01:49:25.914]  And the real reason for the quiz and the real reason for the game is to get everybody using their noggins to ask this question to yourself.
[01:49:25.914 --> 01:49:28.156]  I think you know the answer.
[01:49:28.156 --> 01:49:29.177]  Will it take two calls?
[01:49:29.177 --> 01:49:30.818]  Will it take ten calls to get the answer?
[01:49:30.818 --> 01:49:34.781]  You can just give me your answer, whether it's wrong or right, and then make your point.
[01:49:34.781 --> 01:49:36.643]  But every caller has to give me your take on this.
[01:49:40.285 --> 01:49:53.828]  Who declares, that's the World Health Organization, and the Marxist-Communist Ethiopia that killed over a million of its people, total Chinese front man, who declares end to COVID global public health emergency?
[01:49:53.828 --> 01:49:59.449]  Why are they doing that?
[01:49:59.449 --> 01:50:01.310]  And let me put a cap on it.
[01:50:01.310 --> 01:50:06.611]  I'll take 10 calls, and if somebody hadn't figured it out after 10 calls, I'll give you the answer.
[01:50:06.611 --> 01:50:07.991]  Because I'm not sure you're going to get the answer.
[01:50:09.025 --> 01:50:10.826]  It's a profound answer.
[01:50:10.826 --> 01:50:13.127]  It's how my brain works.
[01:50:13.127 --> 01:50:20.829]  And I told friends and family that when you see this happen, you think this is good?
[01:50:20.829 --> 01:50:27.272]  I'm not going to give you any more hints.
[01:50:27.272 --> 01:50:32.774]  WHO declares end to COVID global public health emergency.
[01:50:32.774 --> 01:50:35.195]  Tedros Adhamo
[01:50:36.400 --> 01:50:45.583]  Gabrisius, Director General of the World Health Organization, said the spread of COVID is no longer a global health public emergency.
[01:50:45.583 --> 01:50:58.668]  The World Health Organization declared on Friday, for more than a year, the pandemic has been on the downward trend, the population immunity increasing for vaccination and infection, mortality decreasing, and the presence of health systems easing.
[01:50:58.668 --> 01:51:02.749]  Who, Director, said and declared it over?
[01:51:02.749 --> 01:51:05.650]  Why are they declaring it over now?
[01:51:07.287 --> 01:51:09.889]  And what's in the SPARS document?
[01:51:09.889 --> 01:51:12.992]  That when it came out, the shot didn't work and was deadly.
[01:51:12.992 --> 01:51:18.556]  They would then start having public health officials resign three years into the pandemic.
[01:51:18.556 --> 01:51:22.940]  And then they would use all the lawsuits that came out of that to bankrupt the countries.
[01:51:22.940 --> 01:51:28.064]  And the vaccine makers have liability protection.
[01:51:28.064 --> 01:51:32.748]  CDC Director Walensky announces departure today.
[01:51:33.803 --> 01:51:43.971]  Wince Walensky, who served as the CDC director since the beginning of the Biden presidency in 2021, has saved lives with her steadfast and unwavering focus on the health of every American.
[01:51:43.971 --> 01:51:53.299]  President Biden said today, she's announced today that she'll leave her post at the end of June for a CDC announcement.
[01:51:53.299 --> 01:51:58.823]  Why are they announcing the end of COVID?
[01:51:58.823 --> 01:52:01.045]  Why are they doing that?
[01:52:04.301 --> 01:52:08.762]  And if you know the answer to that, you know the answer to everything.
[01:52:08.762 --> 01:52:09.163]  U.S.
[01:52:09.163 --> 01:52:14.224]  intelligence is covering up the fact that it knew about COVID-19 in November 2019.
[01:52:14.224 --> 01:52:16.265]  Knew about it?
[01:52:16.265 --> 01:52:17.765]  They created it.
[01:52:17.765 --> 01:52:23.107]  That's come out in Congress.
[01:52:23.107 --> 01:52:24.748]  So the toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[01:52:29.940 --> 01:52:30.220]  877-789-2539.
[01:52:30.220 --> 01:52:31.921]  877-789-Alex.
[01:52:31.921 --> 01:52:35.243]  877-789-2539.
[01:52:35.243 --> 01:52:53.512]  You can cover any topic you want, any issue I've raised, any issue I haven't raised, it's a free-for-all, but you first gotta give me the answer, or what you think the answer is.
[01:52:53.512 --> 01:52:55.733]  And I'm not poo-pooing your answer, I'm not saying
[01:52:56.892 --> 01:53:03.237]  I'm right completely, though I know that I am in the general sense.
[01:53:03.237 --> 01:53:06.119]  I know why they did it.
[01:53:06.119 --> 01:53:09.021]  And if you understand that, you understand a lot.
[01:53:09.021 --> 01:53:13.505]  I really want to see if you can come up with the answer.
[01:53:13.505 --> 01:53:14.085]  877-789-2539.
[01:53:14.085 --> 01:53:18.108]  The frustration is thousands will try to call in.
[01:53:18.108 --> 01:53:19.970]  Only a few will get on.
[01:53:19.970 --> 01:53:23.212]  And I'm sure some of you out there right now know the answer.
[01:53:23.212 --> 01:53:25.334]  But the whole point is this processes
[01:53:26.530 --> 01:53:36.261]  This process of getting people to think, why is their big power grab, their big U.N.
[01:53:36.261 --> 01:53:46.213]  operation, the thing that gives them their world ID and their control, all of it, their social credit score, their vaccine passport, why are they saying their key to power
[01:53:50.267 --> 01:53:51.688]  He's no longer there.
[01:53:51.688 --> 01:53:53.929]  Well, there's a lot of reasons that lead up to that.
[01:53:53.929 --> 01:53:58.831]  We're not buying into it, and people know the shot doesn't work, and almost no one's taking it.
[01:53:58.831 --> 01:54:00.431]  Yeah, yeah, we know all that.
[01:54:00.431 --> 01:54:01.812]  They were going to push us as far as they could.
[01:54:01.812 --> 01:54:06.034]  If they could take over with just this, they'd have done it.
[01:54:06.034 --> 01:54:06.694]  But it's failed.
[01:54:06.694 --> 01:54:11.316]  I'm giving you a lot of hints here.
[01:54:11.316 --> 01:54:16.338]  Let's see if you can answer the question.
[01:54:17.574 --> 01:54:19.476]  Let's see if you've got the answer.
[01:54:19.476 --> 01:54:21.797]  877-789-ALEX.
[01:54:21.797 --> 01:54:26.641]  All right, let's do this now.
[01:54:26.641 --> 01:54:35.028]  Since we're talking about ways they are attacking us, not just the poison shots, but the rest of it, let's look at a couple more of these stories.
[01:54:35.028 --> 01:54:39.011]  Fentanyl overdose deaths skyrocketed 279% in just the last six years.
[01:54:45.854 --> 01:54:52.238]  It's now the number one cause of death below the age of 45.
[01:54:52.238 --> 01:54:54.319]  Hundreds of thousands a year die.
[01:54:54.319 --> 01:55:00.862]  They say it's 100,000, but they think only a fraction ever get diagnosed that it was fentanyl.
[01:55:00.862 --> 01:55:02.903]  With the coroners.
[01:55:02.903 --> 01:55:05.645]  With the pathologists.
[01:55:05.645 --> 01:55:08.707]  Big article on InfoWars.com.
[01:55:08.707 --> 01:55:10.408]  So let's shift gears over here.
[01:55:10.408 --> 01:55:10.928]  Oh, look at this.
[01:55:13.536 --> 01:55:22.301]  University slammed for erasing the word woman from its maternity and menopause policies.
[01:55:22.301 --> 01:55:29.045]  We'll cover that coming up, but let's look more at this.
[01:55:29.045 --> 01:55:30.085]  Mental strain.
[01:55:30.085 --> 01:55:35.408]  Marijuana may be behind a 30% of schizophrenia that's off the charts.
[01:55:35.408 --> 01:55:36.409]  Cases in young men.
[01:55:36.409 --> 01:55:40.611]  Major National Institutes of Health, that's the UK, funded study suggests.
[01:55:42.247 --> 01:55:48.470]  I remember telling Joe Rogan on his show like six years ago that schizophrenia was exploding because of marijuana.
[01:55:48.470 --> 01:55:49.510]  He didn't know it then.
[01:55:49.510 --> 01:55:52.451]  Since then he's researched it and seen a lot of his friends go crazy on it.
[01:55:52.451 --> 01:56:00.434]  But here's a study that the weaponized super strong marijuana is a hallucinogen and it's causing serious mental illness.
[01:56:00.434 --> 01:56:01.335]  What else do they push him?
[01:56:02.256 --> 01:56:06.659]  Mobile phone use increases heart attacks and stroke risk, study claims.
[01:56:06.659 --> 01:56:13.423]  Because you don't walk outside as much, you don't move around as much, it also electromagnetically is toxic.
[01:56:13.423 --> 01:56:15.564]  There's a lot of reasons this is going on.
[01:56:15.564 --> 01:56:19.446]  This is out of the Express newspaper of UK.
[01:56:19.446 --> 01:56:25.550]  Researchers claim people who spend 30 minutes talking on their mobile phone a week have a higher risk of stroke and heart attacks.
[01:56:25.550 --> 01:56:29.573]  A team of scientists, what's an electromagnetic microwave relay tower?
[01:56:29.573 --> 01:56:31.634]  A team of scientists and radio waves emitted by the
[01:56:32.972 --> 01:56:39.277]  Endemic devices can cause high blood pressure in users for a long period of time.
[01:56:39.277 --> 01:56:50.165]  Experts said data shows those texting on a cell phone for 30 minutes, talking on a cell phone for 30 minutes or more a week had a 12% risk of a higher condition than those who spent less time chatting.
[01:56:50.165 --> 01:56:57.211]  Yes, they are microwave ovens held to your head.
[01:56:59.622 --> 01:57:09.331]  All right, let's talk about Woody Allen when we come back, and Jeffrey Epstein, and the CIA director, and the Mossad director, and the head of MI6.
[01:57:09.331 --> 01:57:15.696]  That's all coming up next hour with so much other news we've not gotten into yet.
[01:57:17.591 --> 01:57:26.217]  Plus all the worship of the British, who aren't even British, Royals, with the coronation of the King that is imminent.
[01:57:26.217 --> 01:57:32.240]  It's all coming up today in hour number three.
[01:57:32.240 --> 01:57:42.867]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, the Coordinates of Liberty, on Band Dog Video, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, and of course, MadMaxWorld.tv.
[01:57:42.867 --> 01:57:44.568]  MadMaxWorld.tv.
[01:57:48.848 --> 01:57:51.429]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[01:57:51.429 --> 01:57:53.691]  Please write this down and please go look this up.
[01:57:53.691 --> 01:57:55.692]  It will change your life.
[01:57:55.692 --> 01:58:04.456]  The UN admits, and the Lansing Medical Journal admits, that upwards of 2 billion people have mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities.
[01:58:04.456 --> 01:58:09.779]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[01:58:09.779 --> 01:58:11.240]  Most iodine in the environment
[01:58:11.960 --> 01:58:15.502]  is bound to other elements so your body can't absorb it.
[01:58:15.502 --> 01:58:19.964]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[01:58:19.964 --> 01:58:27.047]  And Infowarestore.com has the only iodine out there that actually has this type of full effect.
[01:58:27.047 --> 01:58:33.050]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3's been sold out for six months, it's very hard to produce, and it's finally back in stock.
[01:58:33.610 --> 01:58:35.971]  I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[01:58:35.971 --> 01:58:38.231]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is powerful.
[01:58:38.231 --> 01:58:40.032]  You and your family need it.
[01:58:40.032 --> 01:58:41.773]  It's 25% off back in stock.
[01:58:41.773 --> 01:58:45.994]  X3 Tri-Iodine, exclusively at Infowarshore.com.
[01:58:45.994 --> 01:58:48.775]  Take action now, but regardless, research is info.
[01:58:48.775 --> 01:58:50.515]  Turbo Force is back.
[01:58:50.515 --> 01:58:52.296]  Sold out for eight months.
[01:58:52.296 --> 01:58:53.796]  And it's Turbo Force Plus.
[01:58:53.796 --> 01:58:55.277]  We made it even stronger.
[01:58:55.957 --> 01:58:59.698]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[01:58:59.698 --> 01:59:04.840]  TurboForce is back in stock at InfowarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:59:04.840 --> 01:59:12.663]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[01:59:12.663 --> 01:59:14.764]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[01:59:14.764 --> 01:59:19.646]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids
[01:59:20.286 --> 01:59:27.828]  That turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[01:59:27.828 --> 01:59:29.829]  It is the super fuel.
[01:59:29.829 --> 01:59:31.289]  RainForce Plus is great.
[01:59:31.289 --> 01:59:32.150]  RainForce Ultra is great.
[01:59:32.150 --> 01:59:33.130]  They're two different nootropics.
[01:59:33.130 --> 01:59:34.310]  They go good with this.
[01:59:34.310 --> 01:59:37.071]  But this is the King Kong.
[01:59:37.071 --> 01:59:38.552]  This is the boss.
[01:59:38.552 --> 01:59:39.272]  TurboForce.
[01:59:39.272 --> 01:59:40.292]  Back in stock.
[01:59:40.292 --> 01:59:41.293]  Discounted.
[01:59:41.293 --> 01:59:43.033]  InfoWareStore.com.
[01:59:43.033 --> 01:59:43.913]  More power.
[01:59:43.913 --> 01:59:44.914]  More strength.
[01:59:44.914 --> 01:59:45.414]  More energy.
[01:59:50.413 --> 01:59:55.035]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:59:55.035 --> 02:00:00.038]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:00.038 --> 02:00:04.741]  I want to talk to you about something right now that can and will change your life.
[02:00:04.741 --> 02:00:07.702]  It's changed my life and millions of other people's lives.
[02:00:07.702 --> 02:00:09.303]  In fact, billions.
[02:00:09.303 --> 02:00:11.444]  Some for the better, some for the worse.
[02:00:11.444 --> 02:00:13.505]  I'm talking about iodine deficiency.
[02:00:13.505 --> 02:00:16.767]  Now, this is a very complex issue.
[02:00:16.767 --> 02:00:18.808]  But in the next few minutes, I want to try to boil it down for you.
[02:00:19.708 --> 02:00:41.236]  I have Wikipedia right here with links to the UN itself, admitting that over 2 billion people have intellectual disability, lower IQs, psychological problems, neurological issues because of lack of iodine, particularly when they're developing and growing as children, but also throughout life.
[02:00:41.236 --> 02:00:47.278]  Now, most iodine that's in food is bound to other elements, so your body cannot absorb it.
[02:00:48.138 --> 02:00:57.420]  Atomic iodine is pure deep-earth crystal iodine, and until we started selling it about 12 years ago, nobody else in the world was doing that.
[02:00:57.420 --> 02:01:06.542]  There are other types of iodine that are not pure atomic, that are very close to it, that are also good for the body and help with the absorption of regular atomic or nascent iodine.
[02:01:06.542 --> 02:01:11.563]  That's why with top researchers, we developed X3 that has a deep-earth crystal iodine,
[02:01:12.808 --> 02:01:16.229]  And two other types of iodine in it as well for better absorption.
[02:01:16.229 --> 02:01:24.911]  And it's been sold out for many, many months, but now we got a big shipment of it in to InfoWarsTore.com right now, and it's 25% off.
[02:01:24.911 --> 02:01:31.293]  So, I want to encourage everybody to go to the encyclopedia, to go to medical literature, go wherever you want.
[02:01:31.293 --> 02:01:35.234]  Wikipedia is not always accurate, but you can check the bibliography here, the links.
[02:01:35.234 --> 02:01:39.575]  This is an accurate report right here from the UN, from major studies, you name it.
[02:01:40.456 --> 02:01:48.862]  about iodine deficiency being the number one cause worldwide of what they call intellectual disability.
[02:01:48.862 --> 02:02:08.274]  And if you look here on page two, it says, while reporting recent progress towards overcoming iodine deficiency disorders worldwide, the Lancet Medical Journal noted that the World Health Organization in 2007, nearly two billion individuals had insufficient iodine intake, a third being school age.
[02:02:08.274 --> 02:02:08.995]  And it goes on
[02:02:09.699 --> 02:02:16.665]  The conclusion was made that the single most preventable case of intellectual disability is that of iodine deficiency.
[02:02:16.665 --> 02:02:19.467]  The single biggest reason people are so dumb
[02:02:20.111 --> 02:02:25.755]  And IQs worldwide are dropping like a lead balloon is iodine deficiency.
[02:02:25.755 --> 02:02:30.759]  Now, there was massive IQ dropping and massive deformities in the 20s and 30s.
[02:02:30.759 --> 02:02:31.580]  So the U.S.
[02:02:31.580 --> 02:02:41.407]  government, as well as other governments, said, by law, we're going to put it in the salt and we're going to encourage bakeries and companies that sell flour to put some iodine in it.
[02:02:43.294 --> 02:02:46.357]  IQs exploded up to 15 points on average in just a few years.
[02:02:46.357 --> 02:03:07.934]  Then, in the 80s, they took it out, and in this own report from Wikipedia, they admit that they put in things that counter the iodine, like bromide, bromine, and other things, instead of the iodine that you need when the other chemicals are toxic.
[02:03:07.934 --> 02:03:10.716]  This is absolutely insane.
[02:03:11.388 --> 02:03:14.909]  So, ladies and gentlemen, get X3 back in stock.
[02:03:14.909 --> 02:03:19.730]  Consult your physician before you use it, because if you already have thyroid issues, there could be some issues.
[02:03:19.730 --> 02:03:24.972]  But find out about the power of triiodine in your body.
[02:03:24.972 --> 02:03:30.613]  Go to mfulworthstore.com, read about it, consult your physician or healthcare provider, and then get a bottle of it.
[02:03:30.613 --> 02:03:35.075]  It usually takes, when you're deficient, about two weeks for you to feel the effects.
[02:03:35.075 --> 02:03:39.336]  After about two weeks, on average, you'll feel a little bit groggy and weird for a few days, and then all of a sudden, boom,
[02:03:40.367 --> 02:03:42.208]  You feel younger, you feel stronger.
[02:03:42.208 --> 02:03:48.852]  Things just for your skin, your body, your libido, your energy, your electrochemical activities in your brain is simply incredible.
[02:03:48.852 --> 02:03:51.073]  So, it's finally back in stock.
[02:03:51.073 --> 02:03:51.994]  X3.
[02:03:51.994 --> 02:03:53.795]  Infowarstore.com.
[02:03:53.795 --> 02:03:56.056]  Stock up on it, because I don't know when we're going to be able to have it again.
[02:03:56.056 --> 02:03:59.378]  And your purchase of X3 funds our operation.
[02:03:59.378 --> 02:04:07.823]  And while you're there, get other great products that are so good for your brain and your cells and your nerves, like our Ultimate Krill Oil, and of course, our 10-hour Clean Powerful Energy
[02:04:08.510 --> 02:04:10.371]  And that is Turbo Force.
[02:04:10.371 --> 02:04:12.473]  Infowarstore.com.
[02:04:12.473 --> 02:04:15.114]  X3 back in stock.
[02:04:15.114 --> 02:04:19.057]  We hope to have it in the future, but it's been sold out for more than six months.
[02:04:19.057 --> 02:04:25.061]  It's very hard to produce it, but it is now available to you and your family yet again.
[02:04:25.061 --> 02:04:28.663]  Experience the power of triiodine.
[02:04:28.663 --> 02:04:31.164]  Do your research and then make the decision now.
[02:04:31.164 --> 02:04:31.885]  We have the best
[02:04:32.902 --> 02:04:33.362]  I don't know.
[02:04:48.877 --> 02:04:51.239]  There's nothing else like this, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:04:51.239 --> 02:04:57.383]  It's waiting for you exclusively at InfoWarsTore.com or by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[02:04:57.383 --> 02:04:59.245]  Check it out.
[02:04:59.245 --> 02:05:04.869]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution is laying right there in front of you, hidden in plain view.
[02:05:05.509 --> 02:05:08.492]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[02:05:08.492 --> 02:05:18.043]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website where they admit the number one cause of cognitive disability in the world is iodine deficiency.
[02:05:18.043 --> 02:05:19.985]  The number one preventable cause
[02:05:20.706 --> 02:05:31.591]  of intellectual disability is lack of real pure iodine in the body as they bomb us with the bad halogens bromine, bromide, chlorine and so much more.
[02:05:31.591 --> 02:05:41.536]  Upwards of 2 billion people in a Lancet medical journal study in 2007 worldwide have cognitive disabilities because they don't have high quality iodine.
[02:05:41.536 --> 02:05:43.917]  Most iodine is bound to other elements you don't absorb it.
[02:05:43.917 --> 02:05:46.959]  We have X3 all three types of good iodine together
[02:05:47.699 --> 02:05:48.080]  We're good.
[02:06:09.304 --> 02:06:13.649]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:06:13.649 --> 02:06:16.011]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:06:34.264 --> 02:06:36.906]  All right, we're taking your calls in the order that they came in.
[02:06:36.906 --> 02:06:49.713]  We're going to Michelle, Rusty, David, Eric, Derek, Terry, Buzz, Matt, Losumbio, Gabe, Michael, and others.
[02:06:49.713 --> 02:06:53.216]  But first off, Michelle in New York.
[02:06:53.216 --> 02:06:55.277]  We're having the quiz.
[02:06:55.277 --> 02:06:58.519]  The WHO declares end of COVID global public health emergency.
[02:07:00.407 --> 02:07:08.389]  Again, I'm not saying this is the perfect answer, I'm not saying it's 100%, but I believe it's being done for a certain reason.
[02:07:08.389 --> 02:07:10.930]  What do you think that is?
[02:07:10.930 --> 02:07:17.691]  I'm not nearly as intelligent as you, Alex, and God bless you, but it's a distraction.
[02:07:17.691 --> 02:07:18.511]  End of story.
[02:07:18.511 --> 02:07:20.792]  Whatever it's for, it's an absolute distraction.
[02:07:22.110 --> 02:07:29.093]  Whether that's the climate lockdown or CBCD or I can't keep up with all the little acronyms anymore.
[02:07:29.093 --> 02:07:30.853]  Or the huge global banking meltdown.
[02:07:30.853 --> 02:07:35.755]  Well, I don't think any answer is wrong because it's for a lot of reasons.
[02:07:35.755 --> 02:07:38.396]  I think that you're close to it, but that's not the answer.
[02:07:38.396 --> 02:07:40.397]  What is your view on New York City?
[02:07:40.397 --> 02:07:40.977]  What's happening there?
[02:07:42.751 --> 02:07:44.893]  I'm going to try to do this without crying.
[02:07:44.893 --> 02:07:46.074]  So I'm in show business.
[02:07:46.074 --> 02:07:46.614]  I've lived here.
[02:07:46.614 --> 02:07:48.676]  I'm born and raised my entire life.
[02:07:48.676 --> 02:07:53.260]  I live at the foot of one of the bridges, which will go unnamed.
[02:07:53.260 --> 02:07:57.464]  I can 100 when you spoke so beautifully of Austin and why you're not leaving.
[02:07:58.364 --> 02:07:59.405]  I can relate to that.
[02:07:59.405 --> 02:08:02.907]  It was so eloquent when you spoke of that.
[02:08:02.907 --> 02:08:06.769]  Like I said, I'm born and raised here, and believe you me, I own property here.
[02:08:06.769 --> 02:08:08.390]  I own the house I live in.
[02:08:08.390 --> 02:08:10.851]  I had a rental property.
[02:08:10.851 --> 02:08:13.772]  I say had because it's almost been stolen.
[02:08:13.772 --> 02:08:19.255]  This is the ground zero experiment for what they want to do in every single way.
[02:08:19.255 --> 02:08:20.716]  We are flooded with immigrants.
[02:08:20.716 --> 02:08:22.037]  You know, God bless them.
[02:08:22.037 --> 02:08:23.898]  They were lured and manipulated here.
[02:08:24.720 --> 02:08:26.281]  Um, a lot of them.
[02:08:26.281 --> 02:08:29.923]  I mean, some of them we know might be criminals.
[02:08:29.923 --> 02:08:37.948]  I cannot imagine how this city is not intrinsically changed within just the next handful of years because we're saturated.
[02:08:38.576 --> 02:08:40.318]  And they have nowhere to go.
[02:08:40.318 --> 02:08:41.499]  So that's one thing.
[02:08:41.499 --> 02:08:45.462]  Your description of the trains.
[02:08:45.462 --> 02:08:46.403]  I don't take the subway.
[02:08:46.403 --> 02:08:47.784]  I drive everywhere.
[02:08:47.784 --> 02:08:48.785]  Everyone laughs at me.
[02:08:48.785 --> 02:08:53.528]  Now it's very difficult to do that because they want us out of our cars.
[02:08:53.528 --> 02:08:55.630]  There are bike lanes everywhere.
[02:08:55.630 --> 02:08:58.853]  During COVID they took the opportunity to put them literally
[02:08:59.699 --> 02:09:00.759]  It's everywhere.
[02:09:00.759 --> 02:09:06.401]  So my house, we used to be able to park, is now a highway of bike lanes.
[02:09:06.401 --> 02:09:10.103]  The thing you don't hear spoken of too much is commercial landlords.
[02:09:10.103 --> 02:09:12.863]  And I know, boo-hoo, not all landlords are bad.
[02:09:12.863 --> 02:09:17.065]  They don't want private ownership in this city, for sure.
[02:09:17.065 --> 02:09:19.246]  They did the eviction moratorium.
[02:09:19.246 --> 02:09:21.346]  That went on until the beginning of this year.
[02:09:21.346 --> 02:09:23.707]  A lot of people don't talk about this.
[02:09:23.707 --> 02:09:28.909]  In New York, the eviction moratorium was not lifted until just four or five months ago.
[02:09:29.489 --> 02:09:40.497]  So I had a tenant for three years not paying rent, okay, and wouldn't give me the keys back, and I only just got it back having to pay a mortgage for two and a half years without any income.
[02:09:40.497 --> 02:09:43.499]  There was no assistance or relief for commercial landlords.
[02:09:43.499 --> 02:09:55.027]  There was no assistance or relief for the property taxes, which are... Sure, remember, the CDC tried to say, no more rents forever, which again, would collapse society.
[02:09:56.132 --> 02:09:56.432]  Right.
[02:09:56.432 --> 02:10:05.697]  My commercial property happens to be in AOC's district, and he told me, AOC told me, my tenant, I don't have to pay rent.
[02:10:05.697 --> 02:10:10.140]  And, you know, and let me tell you that the courts upheld that.
[02:10:10.140 --> 02:10:12.661]  So, you know... It's totally designed to collapse society.
[02:10:12.661 --> 02:10:13.281]  Incredible call.
[02:10:13.281 --> 02:10:14.722]  Got to move the next person.
[02:10:14.722 --> 02:10:15.743]  Thank you so much.
[02:10:15.743 --> 02:10:17.423]  Rusty in Colorado.
[02:10:17.423 --> 02:10:23.867]  Do you know why I believe the WHO declared an end to the COVID global pandemic health emergency?
[02:10:25.622 --> 02:10:28.443]  I believe I do, Mr. Jones.
[02:10:28.443 --> 02:10:38.406]  I believe that the WHO wants to strip away our sovereignty, and when we start prosecuting people based on what they said, for treason, they're going to come and occupy us.
[02:10:38.406 --> 02:10:42.167]  And then we'll never, we'll never get rid of them.
[02:10:42.167 --> 02:10:44.187]  Okay, but let me ask you a question.
[02:10:44.187 --> 02:10:46.048]  Sure, they've got the WHO treaty.
[02:10:46.048 --> 02:10:49.309]  You're right, they're taking over our medical system, trying to take over our body.
[02:10:49.309 --> 02:10:54.430]  But if the source of their power is the COVID emergency, why would they be ending it?
[02:10:56.686 --> 02:11:05.573]  So that the people who refuse to give amnesty to the ones that, you know, enforced all of this on us, okay?
[02:11:05.573 --> 02:11:13.759]  They'll see that as a militant action, like we're in a new state of emergency, and that we can't save ourselves from it.
[02:11:13.759 --> 02:11:18.423]  So they'll come here, and they'll occupy us, and that'll be that.
[02:11:18.423 --> 02:11:19.463]  There goes our sovereignty.
[02:11:19.463 --> 02:11:20.204]  We'll never get it back.
[02:11:20.891 --> 02:11:22.072]  Alright, well there is a U.N.
[02:11:22.072 --> 02:11:26.256]  takeover of our sovereignty, you're dead right about that, but that is not the answer.
[02:11:26.256 --> 02:11:28.598]  You wanted to say something else?
[02:11:28.598 --> 02:11:41.169]  Yes, my sister, but she was on Adderall for a long time, and when the shortages happened, I went and got her a three month supply of the Brain Force Plus, and at this point, she's not even taking the Adderall anymore.
[02:11:41.169 --> 02:11:45.853]  She's using Brain Force Plus almost daily.
[02:11:45.853 --> 02:11:46.654]  What does she think of it?
[02:11:48.362 --> 02:11:49.344]  She likes it.
[02:11:49.344 --> 02:11:52.629]  You know, she took advantage of the sales.
[02:11:52.629 --> 02:11:54.953]  I told her to jump on it before it ends this week.
[02:11:54.953 --> 02:11:59.641]  You know, I heard somebody, I don't know, maybe last week say that the sale's going to end soon.
[02:12:01.793 --> 02:12:05.616]  Of course, I bought myself some Red Pill also.
[02:12:05.616 --> 02:12:12.822]  Well, I appreciate your support, but definitely there are natural, healthy stimulants that are way better than the ones that are being pushed on people.
[02:12:12.822 --> 02:12:15.924]  And I would say, never get into stimulants, period, that aren't natural.
[02:12:15.924 --> 02:12:21.268]  But once you've been on artificial ones, it's a must to have the natural ones.
[02:12:21.268 --> 02:12:25.972]  So, folks, we'll check out the Real Red Pill, Brain Force Plus, Brain Force Ultra, and Turbo Force.
[02:12:25.972 --> 02:12:27.213]  Thank you so much for calling, Rusty.
[02:12:28.234 --> 02:12:32.497]  Alright, David in Wisconsin.
[02:12:32.497 --> 02:12:45.787]  The quiz is, not what the answer is, but what does Alex Jones think the reason is the UN has announced the end of their COVID power grab?
[02:12:45.787 --> 02:12:56.135]  I think the reason Alex Jones thinks the World Health Organization declares an end to the global health emergency is because Title 42 is
[02:12:57.697 --> 02:13:15.962]  Suspected to end next week and that's going to open the floodgates of tens of thousands of illegals untested, unvaccinated people to just rush our border and they can't test them and that's what I think you think.
[02:13:15.962 --> 02:13:18.942]  That is a great angle and all of your answers are right.
[02:13:18.942 --> 02:13:21.103]  I'm not just being like everybody gets a trophy.
[02:13:21.103 --> 02:13:22.283]  All these answers are correct.
[02:13:22.283 --> 02:13:25.244]  It's all part of a larger reason, but there's a larger reason
[02:13:26.550 --> 02:13:29.252]  They are doing this.
[02:13:29.252 --> 02:13:35.537]  There's a larger reason they're saying it, and I'm going to get to that if ten callers cannot figure it out.
[02:13:35.537 --> 02:13:48.428]  Yeah, I'm honestly looking forward to your answer, and another reason I called in is I listened to yesterday's show with you, and you were talking about Prank Salon.
[02:13:48.428 --> 02:13:52.371]  He made that disgusting deepfake of
[02:13:53.120 --> 02:14:14.308]  Tucker Carlson's voice and was saying some really horrible things about like really just gross things to you in Tucker Carlson's voice but according to Prank Salon's Twitter he was arrested two hours ago and they have a nice photo of him being hauled out in handcuffs by some agent with a badge on his coat.
[02:14:14.308 --> 02:14:19.210]  So just a little FYI to people being disgusting and
[02:14:20.071 --> 02:14:26.978]  Trying to imitate, I mean, Tucker's such an honorable person, trying to imitate him and, you know... Is that a joke?
[02:14:26.978 --> 02:14:30.842]  Guys, guys, go look up... No, no, no, pull up his Twitter right now, Alex.
[02:14:30.842 --> 02:14:38.950]  No, no, I'm not denying you're wrong, that's just... Look, look, what I said he should be arrested is because he made a big joke about it.
[02:14:38.950 --> 02:14:42.294]  He literally stole that idiot's phone number, like swatting.
[02:14:43.570 --> 02:14:53.835]  You programmed Tucker Carlson's number in, called me, and then said sexually aggressive things, which an average person wouldn't know that was fake.
[02:14:53.835 --> 02:14:55.576]  I figured it out pretty quick.
[02:14:55.576 --> 02:14:57.256]  But it's very aggressive.
[02:14:57.256 --> 02:14:59.337]  I think that's identity theft.
[02:14:59.337 --> 02:15:00.398]  Yeah, same here.
[02:15:00.398 --> 02:15:01.098]  Same here.
[02:15:01.098 --> 02:15:02.139]  I think that as well.
[02:15:02.139 --> 02:15:08.622]  According to Twitter, his mom posted on his Twitter, this is Prank's mother, Pranika.
[02:15:08.622 --> 02:15:09.682]  I don't know if that's real or not.
[02:15:09.682 --> 02:15:10.943]  That name just seems fake to me.
[02:15:11.886 --> 02:15:19.593]  But according to his mother, he was arrested, and it does show a photo of him being arrested, so... Alright, brother, we're gonna go to break.
[02:15:19.593 --> 02:15:25.137]  We'll have to look into that.
[02:15:25.137 --> 02:15:26.078]  I don't know if this is real.
[02:15:26.078 --> 02:15:27.139]  It may be him joking around.
[02:15:27.139 --> 02:15:32.283]  It looks like somebody... Go ahead.
[02:15:32.283 --> 02:15:33.704]  Thanks so much, Alex.
[02:15:33.704 --> 02:15:34.145]  God bless.
[02:15:34.145 --> 02:15:34.445]  Thank you.
[02:15:34.445 --> 02:15:35.226]  I appreciate your call.
[02:15:35.226 --> 02:15:37.968]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[02:15:39.454 --> 02:15:46.303]  On the other side, why are they announcing the end to the UN COVID Power Drill?
[02:15:46.303 --> 02:15:48.887]  Why are they doing that?
[02:15:48.887 --> 02:15:52.452]  Terry, Buzz, Matt, everybody else, your calls are straight ahead.
[02:15:52.452 --> 02:15:53.193]  Stay with us.
[02:15:58.252 --> 02:16:05.178]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire food supply.
[02:16:05.178 --> 02:16:14.005]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element, which has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[02:16:14.005 --> 02:16:16.207]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[02:16:16.827 --> 02:16:20.129]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[02:16:20.129 --> 02:16:28.654]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally keep the soil rich with iodine.
[02:16:28.654 --> 02:16:33.477]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day.
[02:16:33.477 --> 02:16:44.424]  Derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the Earth's surface, our InfoWars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[02:16:44.984 --> 02:16:47.026]  Pure nascent iodine.
[02:16:47.026 --> 02:16:51.051]  Stabilized in an activated triiodine form.
[02:16:51.051 --> 02:16:57.938]  For a healthy thyroid and a healthy metabolism, get yours now at InfoWarStore.com.
[02:16:57.938 --> 02:17:01.862]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government.
[02:17:02.062 --> 02:17:05.825]  A flying disc has been found and is now in the possession of the army.
[02:17:05.825 --> 02:17:08.207]  Here is a bulletin from CBS News.
[02:17:08.207 --> 02:17:10.609]  President Kennedy has been shot.
[02:17:10.609 --> 02:17:13.951]  This is a different kind of war.
[02:17:13.951 --> 02:17:18.415]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and computer guns.
[02:17:18.415 --> 02:17:21.818]  The CIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[02:17:21.818 --> 02:17:25.861]  They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[02:17:25.861 --> 02:17:28.223]  It was almost as if it were a plan in motion.
[02:17:28.223 --> 02:17:29.604]  It just can't happen.
[02:17:29.964 --> 02:17:33.746]  We need to go into the Capitol!
[02:17:33.746 --> 02:17:35.867]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[02:17:35.867 --> 02:17:37.488]  They are nothing but distraction.
[02:17:37.488 --> 02:17:40.250]  You guys censored Harvard educated doctors.
[02:17:40.250 --> 02:17:42.171]  You silenced those voices.
[02:17:42.171 --> 02:17:45.933]  What we want to do in Davos is push the reset button.
[02:17:45.933 --> 02:17:52.696]  Soon as we start exposing the Great Reset, the sooner these globalists start going to prison!
[02:17:52.696 --> 02:17:58.860]  Right now,
[02:17:59.912 --> 02:18:10.335]  I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to InfoWarsTore.com and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that empower your immune system and your body and keep us on air.
[02:18:10.335 --> 02:18:18.678]  I am humbly, hand in hand, talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in, many of you for years, and never gone to InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:18:18.678 --> 02:18:27.161]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you never actually go to InfoWarsTore.com and never experience these great products and never find the operation.

[02:18:31.903 --> 02:18:33.424]  But we need funds to operate.
[02:18:33.424 --> 02:18:41.789]  Plus, we've got really great products that do amazing things for people, like our CBD oil, and our Fizzy Magnesium, and our Sleep Aid, and our Nitric Oxide, and our Real Red Pill.
[02:18:41.789 --> 02:18:44.750]  Plus, all of these are really great products that keep us on air.
[02:18:44.750 --> 02:18:46.511]  Plus, you're missing out on having these products.
[02:18:46.511 --> 02:18:55.416]  So get off the bench, get in the game, step to the plate, and go to InfoWarsTore.com right now and get these great InfoWars products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:18:57.591 --> 02:19:03.315]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on Earth.
[02:19:03.315 --> 02:19:05.997]  And they've got our children drinking that.
[02:19:05.997 --> 02:19:08.598]  This is a psychotic death cult.
[02:19:08.598 --> 02:19:09.359]  Period.
[02:19:09.359 --> 02:19:10.440]  Case closed.
[02:19:10.440 --> 02:19:11.821]  Out to get you and your family.
[02:19:11.821 --> 02:19:16.804]  We sell the Alexa Pure Breeze, made by the My Patriot Supply Ready Hour Group.
[02:19:16.804 --> 02:19:18.205]  It's been around about 15 years.
[02:19:18.205 --> 02:19:19.666]  Became the biggest company in the last six.
[02:19:20.086 --> 02:19:29.654]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse-engineered the fancy best water filter system out there that sells for twice the price, and they made it as good in all the studies.
[02:19:29.654 --> 02:19:32.857]  It reduces things to non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals.
[02:19:32.857 --> 02:19:34.378]  But you can go pay two or three times.
[02:19:34.378 --> 02:19:37.201]  There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[02:19:37.201 --> 02:19:42.425]  We sell the very best, highest-grade water filtration system for half the price of the leading competitor.
[02:19:42.425 --> 02:19:45.648]  And the media says we're bad, and a cult
[02:19:46.008 --> 02:19:47.870]  We're telling you, you should filter your water.
[02:19:47.870 --> 02:19:49.512]  You should also filter your shower water.
[02:19:49.512 --> 02:19:51.094]  That's another way you absorb this crap.
[02:19:51.094 --> 02:19:52.655]  But I'm done talking about that.
[02:19:52.655 --> 02:19:55.298]  The point is, you can get the filters at infowarestore.com.
[02:19:55.298 --> 02:19:56.420]  They're discounted right now.
[02:19:56.420 --> 02:19:58.722]  Finally back in stock.
[02:19:58.722 --> 02:20:03.327]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:20:03.327 --> 02:20:04.629]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:20:16.838 --> 02:20:20.219]  This A&M professor asks, when is it okay to kill whites?
[02:20:20.219 --> 02:20:24.481]  New York professor says having a white nuclear family promotes white supremacy.
[02:20:24.481 --> 02:20:27.422]  Professor tweets that white people should commit mass suicide.
[02:20:27.422 --> 02:20:31.304]  College professor says kill cops, kill all white people, and kill the straights.
[02:20:31.304 --> 02:20:34.285]  Professor says all I want for Christmas is white genocide.
[02:20:34.285 --> 02:20:36.926]  Georgetown professor says all white people are racist.
[02:20:36.926 --> 02:20:39.907]  Trinity College professor calls white people inhuman.
[02:20:39.907 --> 02:20:41.188]  Let them f***ing die.
[02:20:41.188 --> 02:20:43.289]  College professor says believing in hard work
[02:20:43.869 --> 02:20:45.390]  Is a white ideology.
[02:20:45.390 --> 02:20:49.171]  College professor says white people are conditioned to commit mass murder.
[02:20:49.171 --> 02:20:51.992]  A professor equates math with white privilege.
[02:20:51.992 --> 02:20:56.553]  A professor says white supremacist patriarchy is responsible for the Vegas shooting.
[02:20:56.553 --> 02:20:59.894]  Professors hold a white racism course at FGCU.
[02:20:59.894 --> 02:21:02.995]  USC professor called for holocaust against all white people.
[02:21:03.235 --> 02:21:08.437]  Professor says I'll teach my children to be cautious and distrust friendship with white people.
[02:21:08.437 --> 02:21:12.858]  Baltimore professor says white people need to personally give all of their money to black people.
[02:21:12.858 --> 02:21:17.059]  College professor says some white people may have to die to solve racism.
[02:21:17.059 --> 02:21:20.801]  College professor says white masculinity is a problem for America.
[02:21:20.801 --> 02:21:23.602]  Georgetown professor says all white people are racists.
[02:21:23.602 --> 02:21:27.863]  Rutgers professor was taken to the NYC hospital for psychiatric evaluation
[02:21:28.463 --> 02:21:31.025]  After he tweeted threatening to kill white people.
[02:21:31.025 --> 02:21:35.627]  White professor calls all white people to mass suicide because of slavery.
[02:21:35.627 --> 02:21:39.149]  Here's a slide from a college classroom that says white tears on a mug.
[02:21:39.149 --> 02:21:42.831]  Here's another slide from a college classroom that says white people stay colonizing.
[02:21:42.831 --> 02:21:44.793]  White privilege does exist.
[02:21:44.793 --> 02:21:47.454]  Bigfoot, unicorns, reverse racism.
[02:21:47.454 --> 02:21:48.855]  What do they all have in common?
[02:21:49.375 --> 02:21:51.556]  Stating that reverse racism isn't real.
[02:21:51.556 --> 02:21:53.617]  Y'all white people are dangerous.
[02:21:53.617 --> 02:21:54.677]  The horror story.
[02:21:54.677 --> 02:21:56.798]  White people are a plague to the planet.
[02:21:56.798 --> 02:21:58.879]  Here's one that says white people are crazy.
[02:21:58.879 --> 02:22:05.101]  And finally, how white people... Plague society.
[02:22:05.101 --> 02:22:07.402]  So, breaking medical examiner rules.
[02:22:07.402 --> 02:22:09.983]  Repeat violent offender Jordan Neely's death.
[02:22:09.983 --> 02:22:10.704]  A homicide.
[02:22:10.704 --> 02:22:13.105]  There's New York City braces for riots.
[02:22:13.105 --> 02:22:14.425]  40 arrests.
[02:22:14.425 --> 02:22:16.326]  Over half of them for assaulting people.
[02:22:17.372 --> 02:22:18.693]  Black, white, you name it.
[02:22:18.693 --> 02:22:20.714]  Assaulting people on the train.
[02:22:20.714 --> 02:22:23.056]  A black man tackled him.
[02:22:23.056 --> 02:22:24.277]  The Hispanic man tried to help.
[02:22:24.277 --> 02:22:28.179]  A white marine choked him and killed him.
[02:22:28.179 --> 02:22:31.942]  Because he was telling them, I'm gonna kill you.
[02:22:31.942 --> 02:22:35.945]  You think these people wanted to do this?
[02:22:35.945 --> 02:22:39.087]  No, he's a mentally ill man that should be in a mental institution.
[02:22:39.087 --> 02:22:42.049]  And I'm sad he's dead.
[02:22:42.049 --> 02:22:43.770]  But the media is seizing on that.
[02:22:48.294 --> 02:22:52.699]  I've got like 10 videos, literally 10 videos of him beating people up and attacking people.
[02:22:52.699 --> 02:22:57.223]  They put up advisories a decade ago about him.
[02:22:57.223 --> 02:23:02.068]  He's been going crazy that long.
[02:23:02.068 --> 02:23:04.110]  And got killed.
[02:23:04.110 --> 02:23:05.912]  And none of us are better off because he's dead.
[02:23:08.530 --> 02:23:16.917]  But imagine if they showed all the footage of black people attacking white people, and then said black people are to blame because a bad black person does something wrong.
[02:23:16.917 --> 02:23:21.681]  Just because a white person does something wrong, or in this case, defending themselves, doesn't mean we're all bad.
[02:23:21.681 --> 02:23:24.723]  It's this idea that, oh, they were slaves hundreds of years ago, so we're all guilty.
[02:23:24.723 --> 02:23:28.646]  Most white people's ancestors immigrated here from countries that were involved in slavery.
[02:23:28.646 --> 02:23:35.832]  But again, if my daddy was a bank robber and served 20 years in jail, I'm not guilty for what my daddy did.
[02:23:35.832 --> 02:23:36.933]  But their authoritarianism,
[02:23:39.011 --> 02:23:46.818]  Under fascism, under totalitarianism, under communism, you are guilty.
[02:23:46.818 --> 02:23:52.243]  In World War II, when the Nazis came through Eastern Europe, there's famous cases of this.
[02:23:52.243 --> 02:23:55.746]  If a regular troop got killed, they'd kill 20 people.
[02:23:55.746 --> 02:23:58.429]  If an officer got killed, they'd kill 100.
[02:23:58.429 --> 02:24:01.952]  They'd say, hey, somebody shot our officer and killed him.
[02:24:01.952 --> 02:24:03.914]  We're going to kill hundreds of you now.
[02:24:03.914 --> 02:24:05.235]  They'd put them in a church and burn it down.
[02:24:12.537 --> 02:24:14.517]  Look it up.
[02:24:14.517 --> 02:24:18.158]  Does that sound like a good system?
[02:24:18.158 --> 02:24:19.839]  You're a great, great, great, great, great granddaddy.
[02:24:19.839 --> 02:24:24.640]  You don't even know, supposedly did something wrong, so now you're guilty because you got a leg up because of that?
[02:24:24.640 --> 02:24:30.241]  What the hell does that mean?
[02:24:30.241 --> 02:24:39.283]  That's tyranny, ladies and gentlemen, and they're not trying to offer all these free deals and money to people because they love black people.
[02:24:39.283 --> 02:24:39.663]  Remember?
[02:24:41.212 --> 02:24:42.552]  Remember?
[02:24:42.552 --> 02:24:45.033]  Biden, three years ago, promised free tuition for everybody.
[02:24:45.033 --> 02:24:47.214]  He was going to forgive all student debt.
[02:24:47.214 --> 02:24:48.354]  And then he didn't do it.
[02:24:48.354 --> 02:24:50.595]  Oh, he signed a law, but didn't implement it.
[02:24:50.595 --> 02:24:51.715]  It's all lies.
[02:24:51.715 --> 02:24:55.356]  They're not going to give you anything free.
[02:24:55.356 --> 02:24:58.837]  Anything you get is going to come with major strings attached.
[02:24:58.837 --> 02:25:02.558]  But I'm asking the big question here.
[02:25:02.558 --> 02:25:03.759]  Why has the U.N.
[02:25:03.759 --> 02:25:07.520]  and its big power grab ended the COVID crisis?
[02:25:08.610 --> 02:25:09.571]  I have the answer.
[02:25:09.571 --> 02:25:10.713]  I want to hear from you.
[02:25:10.713 --> 02:25:12.134]  Terry in Alaska, you're on the air.
[02:25:12.134 --> 02:25:13.796]  Go ahead.
[02:25:13.796 --> 02:25:15.058]  Yeah, Alex, can you hear me?
[02:25:15.058 --> 02:25:15.358]  I can.
[02:25:15.358 --> 02:25:16.780]  Go ahead.
[02:25:16.780 --> 02:25:18.442]  Yeah, I think it's one of two things.
[02:25:18.442 --> 02:25:26.592]  It's either their numbers are showing that nobody wants their poison anymore or they're getting ready to release the next bioweapon.
[02:25:27.537 --> 02:25:27.957]  Boom!
[02:25:27.957 --> 02:25:29.378]  He wins!
[02:25:29.378 --> 02:25:40.744]  Get his name, get his address, he gets a signed copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World, and he gets a choice of Trump political prisoner shirt or Alex Jones for President.
[02:25:40.744 --> 02:25:45.367]  You tell us what you want, give us your address, and make damn sure, Cruz, I'm going to start doing this prize thing almost every day.
[02:25:45.367 --> 02:25:47.428]  Can I say something else?
[02:25:47.428 --> 02:25:48.128]  No, no, no.
[02:25:48.128 --> 02:25:49.209]  First off, you win.
[02:25:49.209 --> 02:25:51.170]  Go ahead and make your point, and then we'll go back.
[02:25:52.270 --> 02:25:56.072]  I'm actually very impressed with the sixth caller I think we took.
[02:25:56.072 --> 02:25:56.573]  Got it.
[02:25:56.573 --> 02:25:57.153]  Go ahead.
[02:25:57.153 --> 02:25:57.794]  I'm very impressed.
[02:25:57.794 --> 02:25:59.455]  Go ahead.
[02:25:59.455 --> 02:26:04.658]  I'd like to see a guy named Paymon Matahede on as a guest sometime, hopefully.
[02:26:04.658 --> 02:26:06.219]  Okay, don't know who he is?
[02:26:06.219 --> 02:26:07.580]  Tell me his name is.
[02:26:07.580 --> 02:26:10.402]  And guys, when you talk to him, get this written down too.
[02:26:10.402 --> 02:26:11.943]  Hold on.
[02:26:11.943 --> 02:26:13.644]  Paymon who?
[02:26:13.644 --> 02:26:15.385]  Matahede.
[02:26:15.385 --> 02:26:16.606]  Paymon Matahede.
[02:26:16.606 --> 02:26:17.026]  Who is he?
[02:26:18.260 --> 02:26:25.723]  He's an Iranian-born citizen, came to America in 94, and anyway, he's never paid taxes.
[02:26:25.723 --> 02:26:26.583]  He's fought the U.S.
[02:26:26.583 --> 02:26:28.364]  Tax Court and won.
[02:26:28.364 --> 02:26:29.565]  He hasn't paid taxes for 30 years.
[02:26:32.153 --> 02:26:32.773]  We'll get him on.
[02:26:32.773 --> 02:26:33.574]  You got my promise.
[02:26:33.574 --> 02:26:35.774]  If he can be gotten on, we'll get him on.
[02:26:35.774 --> 02:26:38.475]  But let's talk about the super hard questions.
[02:26:38.475 --> 02:26:39.876]  I didn't come up with an easy one.
[02:26:39.876 --> 02:26:45.758]  And I'm extremely impressed by our audience that thousands tried to call in, 20 got on the line, and the sixth caller got it.
[02:26:45.758 --> 02:26:48.019]  So I'm very impressed right now.
[02:26:48.019 --> 02:26:49.839]  Terry, very impressed.
[02:26:49.839 --> 02:26:54.421]  Tell us about yourself and how you came up with the answer.
[02:26:54.421 --> 02:26:56.181]  Gee, I don't know.
[02:26:56.181 --> 02:26:56.982]  Just thought about it.
[02:26:58.928 --> 02:27:20.811]  I used to take your magazine that when you publish that and I live right here by two military bases one's Army and one's Air Force and I take your magazines out and drop them off at the Army base and then one day I took them out to the Air Force base and the visitor center wasn't open where they check you in and give you a pass so I shoved it through the doors and
[02:27:22.199 --> 02:27:23.580]  About five copies.
[02:27:23.580 --> 02:27:28.244]  And then I went to leave and behind me, two guys with fully automatic weapons.
[02:27:28.244 --> 02:27:30.866]  They want to know what the hell I'm doing.
[02:27:30.866 --> 02:27:34.369]  And so I told them and they go, well, you can't be doing that.
[02:27:34.369 --> 02:27:36.811]  I go, they said, you know, it's closed anyway.
[02:27:36.811 --> 02:27:38.432]  They go, come back out another day.
[02:27:38.432 --> 02:27:43.996]  So I went back out another day, they were open and I handed them out and they liked it.
[02:27:43.996 --> 02:27:46.198]  And I tried to, went to leave.
[02:27:46.198 --> 02:27:49.521]  And one of the guys came out from the back room and said, sir, we need you to stay here.
[02:27:50.806 --> 02:28:01.058]  And then I ended up getting interrogated by some guys in suits and they wanted to charge me with distribution of propaganda on a military base.
[02:28:01.058 --> 02:28:03.100]  Well that just shows how many tyrants they've got.
[02:28:03.100 --> 02:28:04.802]  They were just trying to intimidate you.
[02:28:04.802 --> 02:28:06.284]  Let me guess, nothing happened?
[02:28:08.376 --> 02:28:17.799]  Well, they were setting up a court date, and I went back in and reminded them that the two guys that caught me on the Saturday when I was there said, come on back out another day, and they decided not to do nothing.
[02:28:17.799 --> 02:28:19.059]  Well, no, it's all intimidation.
[02:28:19.059 --> 02:28:20.440]  It's the First Amendment.
[02:28:20.440 --> 02:28:26.462]  So they're telling an American, you can't hand out a well-known pro-America person.
[02:28:26.462 --> 02:28:31.143]  This is so sick, but I'm going to hold you over, because you're the winner.
[02:28:31.143 --> 02:28:33.764]  Get his name, get his number, just get his address.
[02:28:33.764 --> 02:28:35.684]  And what t-shirt do you want?
[02:28:35.684 --> 02:28:37.205]  Do you want Trump?
[02:28:38.217 --> 02:28:40.958]  Political President or do you want an Alex Jones for President shirt?
[02:28:40.958 --> 02:28:42.058]  Alex Jones for President.
[02:28:42.058 --> 02:28:42.979]  I wish he'd run.
[02:28:42.979 --> 02:28:47.900]  Alright, well, we're going to get your address right now and it's coming to you in the mail by Monday.
[02:28:47.900 --> 02:28:49.181]  So just don't hang up.
[02:28:49.181 --> 02:28:51.482]  I'm going to come back to you because you nailed it.
[02:28:51.482 --> 02:28:52.262]  I'm going to explain this.
[02:28:52.262 --> 02:28:54.022]  This is really important when we come back.
[02:28:54.022 --> 02:28:55.043]  You nailed it.
[02:28:55.043 --> 02:28:55.163]  Woo!
[02:28:57.910 --> 02:29:00.491]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[02:29:00.491 --> 02:29:02.753]  Please write this down and please go look this up.
[02:29:02.753 --> 02:29:04.754]  It will change your life.
[02:29:04.754 --> 02:29:13.498]  The UN admits, and the Lansing Medical Journal admits, that upwards of 2 billion people have mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities.
[02:29:13.498 --> 02:29:18.821]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[02:29:18.821 --> 02:29:20.302]  Most iodine in the environment
[02:29:21.002 --> 02:29:24.545]  is bound to other elements so your body can't absorb it.
[02:29:24.545 --> 02:29:29.009]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[02:29:29.009 --> 02:29:36.096]  And InfoWarStore.com has the only iodine out there that actually has this type of full effect.
[02:29:36.096 --> 02:29:42.122]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3's been sold out for six months, it's very hard to produce, and it's finally back in stock.
[02:29:42.662 --> 02:29:45.043]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[02:29:45.043 --> 02:29:47.284]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is powerful.
[02:29:47.284 --> 02:29:49.084]  You and your family need it.
[02:29:49.084 --> 02:29:50.825]  It's 25% off back in stock.
[02:29:50.825 --> 02:29:52.685]  X3 Tri-Iodine.
[02:29:52.685 --> 02:29:55.046]  Exclusively at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:29:55.046 --> 02:29:57.507]  Take action now, but regardless, research is info.
[02:30:06.198 --> 02:30:14.922]  You need to get coordinated with not only your food, but also your health supplements, because it's going to be a matter of life and death.
[02:30:14.922 --> 02:30:17.103]  So support InfoWars Store.
[02:30:17.103 --> 02:30:22.005]  Listen, you need to put it as a priority, because you don't know, I don't know.
[02:30:22.005 --> 02:30:25.586]  Alex and I are telling you how late it is before midnight strikes.
[02:30:25.586 --> 02:30:30.228]  And again, magnesium is critical for your muscles and everything.
[02:30:30.228 --> 02:30:31.129]  Krill oil.
[02:30:31.129 --> 02:30:33.710]  What I'm watching right before my eyes is a
[02:30:34.730 --> 02:30:35.610]  We're good.
[02:30:59.031 --> 02:31:02.153]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[02:31:02.153 --> 02:31:04.454]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[02:31:04.454 --> 02:31:08.376]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[02:31:08.376 --> 02:31:17.321]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[02:31:17.321 --> 02:31:24.205]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week.
[02:31:24.205 --> 02:31:25.086]  It's really just incredible.
[02:31:26.121 --> 02:31:29.003]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[02:31:29.003 --> 02:31:35.547]  I want to encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[02:31:35.547 --> 02:31:38.588]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[02:31:38.588 --> 02:31:47.534]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, while at the same time keeping us on air.
[02:31:47.534 --> 02:31:51.096]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:31:51.816 --> 02:31:56.758]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsaw.com, our funding problems will be over.
[02:31:56.758 --> 02:31:58.159]  Please take action now.
[02:31:58.159 --> 02:32:06.363]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, is a historic book that documents the globalists, in their own words, plan for our future.
[02:32:06.363 --> 02:32:07.804]  That is a hellish future.
[02:32:07.804 --> 02:32:16.388]  Now you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores, Amazon, or InfoWarsaw.com.
[02:32:17.208 --> 02:32:22.812]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[02:32:22.812 --> 02:32:25.394]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[02:32:25.394 --> 02:32:30.758]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World, a signed copy, at InfoWarsHore.com.
[02:32:30.758 --> 02:32:34.701]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[02:32:34.701 --> 02:32:40.246]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that you helped keep InfoWars on the air.
[02:32:40.246 --> 02:32:42.688]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book.
[02:32:43.468 --> 02:32:44.469]  Or unsigned copies.
[02:32:44.469 --> 02:32:54.878]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to Infowarshore.com and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate them to the library or give them to the local school.
[02:32:54.878 --> 02:32:55.918]  This is an Infowar.
[02:32:55.918 --> 02:32:58.741]  I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[02:32:58.741 --> 02:33:03.345]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:33:03.345 --> 02:33:04.646]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:13.303 --> 02:33:20.465]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:20.465 --> 02:33:25.127]  I'm just an average man with an average life.
[02:33:25.127 --> 02:33:26.227]  I work from 9 to 5.
[02:33:26.227 --> 02:33:28.548]  Hell, I pay the price.
[02:33:28.548 --> 02:33:32.789]  All I want is to be left alone in my average home.
[02:33:32.789 --> 02:33:34.270]  But why do I always feel
[02:33:36.107 --> 02:33:40.411]  Alright, so Terry with the incredibly hard question I asked.
[02:33:40.411 --> 02:33:42.173]  I'm surprised actually a caller got it.
[02:33:42.173 --> 02:33:44.695]  I thought we'd take 10 calls and I would answer the question.
[02:33:44.695 --> 02:33:46.998]  I was happy to send out a book and a t-shirt.
[02:33:46.998 --> 02:33:49.800]  I'm blown away that he got the answer.
[02:33:49.800 --> 02:33:58.349]  Because I only this morning saw it and months ago I told my wife and family, when you see this, this means they're about to make their next move.
[02:33:58.349 --> 02:33:59.430]  And I hadn't said it on air yet.
[02:34:01.314 --> 02:34:02.995]  Yes, the world's saying no to the shot.
[02:34:02.995 --> 02:34:06.256]  Yes, all these officials that pushed us are resigning.
[02:34:06.256 --> 02:34:12.319]  Yes, it's coming out that they had secret liability protection programs with Moderna and Pfizer.
[02:34:12.319 --> 02:34:29.166]  But when they end the emergency, it's so they can declare victory and claim all their lockdowns and all their controls saved us and that they defeated it.
[02:34:29.166 --> 02:34:29.626]  And so,
[02:34:31.752 --> 02:34:37.434]  You can read the tea leaves, maybe a month, six months, probably next year.
[02:34:37.434 --> 02:34:41.215]  Probably early next year they start the new pandemic and the new virus.
[02:34:41.215 --> 02:34:46.696]  And they'll say, hey, we saved you from COVID with the lockdowns, the controls, the shots.
[02:34:46.696 --> 02:34:48.237]  We ended it together.
[02:34:48.237 --> 02:34:50.157]  We're victorious.
[02:34:50.157 --> 02:34:52.598]  The UN did it.
[02:34:52.598 --> 02:34:56.939]  That's why we've got the UN treaty.
[02:34:56.939 --> 02:35:00.340]  You need to ratify it and we'll protect you from this new thing.
[02:35:02.637 --> 02:35:11.204]  Whether it's Mousepox or Morberg or a new strain of COVID that they've cooked up.
[02:35:11.204 --> 02:35:13.005]  So, what a hard question.
[02:35:13.005 --> 02:35:17.429]  What an incredibly complex question of thousands of answers.
[02:35:17.429 --> 02:35:21.652]  And the other callers brought up issues that were corollary to it, that were part of it.
[02:35:22.934 --> 02:35:24.956]  But not the main issue.
[02:35:24.956 --> 02:35:27.237]  I am very impressed.
[02:35:27.237 --> 02:35:32.521]  So, nothing against your sagas and what you've gone through to spread the truth, Terry, but those are side issues.
[02:35:32.521 --> 02:35:34.122]  We love you.
[02:35:34.122 --> 02:35:37.305]  Sitting there thinking about the question, how did you come up with the answer?
[02:35:37.305 --> 02:35:40.767]  Because what this means is, they're preparing the next assault.
[02:35:40.767 --> 02:35:42.649]  They say the disease X is coming.
[02:35:42.649 --> 02:35:44.650]  They say the next pandemic's imminent.
[02:35:44.650 --> 02:35:45.931]  They've already told us.
[02:35:45.931 --> 02:35:47.232]  So we can telegraph how they're preparing.
[02:35:47.232 --> 02:35:49.093]  But this is what's happening.
[02:35:49.093 --> 02:35:49.654]  Make no mistake.
[02:35:51.479 --> 02:35:56.282]  Thinking about this, understanding it, and you watch it in six months, a year, you'll see it happen.
[02:35:56.282 --> 02:35:58.884]  Get enough pressure, they may back off.
[02:35:58.884 --> 02:36:01.426]  Our only predictions that don't come true are the ones we stop.
[02:36:01.426 --> 02:36:02.827]  Believe me, I want to be disproven here.
[02:36:02.827 --> 02:36:05.129]  I want to stop it so our predictions will come true.
[02:36:05.129 --> 02:36:11.513]  But we'll be sitting here in six months, a year, and it'll be, oh my God, he did it again.
[02:36:11.513 --> 02:36:12.114]  I didn't do it again.
[02:36:12.114 --> 02:36:14.435]  I didn't do it again.
[02:36:14.435 --> 02:36:16.277]  I know the enemy's operation.
[02:36:16.277 --> 02:36:17.858]  They did it again.
[02:36:17.858 --> 02:36:20.760]  So, go back, Terry, in Alaska.
[02:36:21.946 --> 02:36:30.728]  To the thought processes, when you're listening to me, when you come up with the exact answer, one out of a million, how'd you do it?
[02:36:30.728 --> 02:36:32.728]  I just kind of put two and two together.
[02:36:32.728 --> 02:36:34.929]  I don't really know how to describe it.
[02:36:34.929 --> 02:36:37.809]  Yeah, well, they need to declare victory that they saved us the last time.
[02:36:37.809 --> 02:36:39.370]  They have to declare victory.
[02:36:39.370 --> 02:36:42.130]  They have to say they saved us so they can save us again.
[02:36:42.130 --> 02:36:44.411]  See how it works?
[02:36:44.411 --> 02:36:48.091]  Yep.
[02:36:48.091 --> 02:36:50.292]  When are you going to be getting some more vitamin mineral fusion?
[02:36:51.181 --> 02:36:52.202]  I wish it wasn't sold out.
[02:36:52.202 --> 02:36:53.522]  I wish we had the money to buy products.
[02:36:53.522 --> 02:36:58.825]  We barely have enough money to buy what we've got, but we're barely in the block right now, and I thank you for your support, brother.
[02:36:58.825 --> 02:37:02.046]  Anything else you'd like to add, Terry?
[02:37:02.046 --> 02:37:13.252]  Yeah, last year I sent an email to Rob Dues trying to get you guys to come up and go salmon fishing and get you to relax a little bit, but you're in the middle of your... I think he actually brought that up to me.
[02:37:13.252 --> 02:37:14.492]  I've never been to Alaska.
[02:37:14.492 --> 02:37:16.553]  I'm told it's spectacular.
[02:37:16.553 --> 02:37:17.454]  It is.
[02:37:17.454 --> 02:37:18.474]  You'd like it.
[02:37:18.474 --> 02:37:19.555]  When should I come?
[02:37:21.118 --> 02:37:28.643]  Well, if you want to go salmon fishing, uh, do I. Guys, give me Terry's number.
[02:37:28.643 --> 02:37:30.464]  I was already thinking about going up there in July.
[02:37:30.464 --> 02:37:39.309]  I was thinking about, never been to Costa Rica, never been to, uh, Kosovo.
[02:37:39.309 --> 02:37:40.690]  They say that's incredible.
[02:37:40.690 --> 02:37:43.312]  Never been to Egypt, but Alaska was on the list.
[02:37:43.312 --> 02:37:43.972]  You know what?
[02:37:43.972 --> 02:37:45.213]  I'll come see you in Alaska.
[02:37:45.213 --> 02:37:48.055]  Put him on hold, get his number.
[02:37:48.055 --> 02:37:48.435]  Incredible.
[02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:52.121]  I'm going to Alaska now, because I got to answer that question.
[02:37:52.121 --> 02:37:53.882]  That is such a hard question to answer.
[02:37:53.882 --> 02:37:56.084]  I mean, that's very impressive.
[02:37:56.084 --> 02:37:57.204]  Six phone calls.
[02:37:57.204 --> 02:37:59.326]  Fifth or sixth was six phone calls.
[02:37:59.326 --> 02:38:00.466]  He nailed it.
[02:38:00.466 --> 02:38:03.208]  And let me tell you, that's what's happening.
[02:38:03.208 --> 02:38:06.390]  They are going to say, we saved you last time, we're going to save you this time.
[02:38:06.390 --> 02:38:08.891]  They're reloading again, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:38:08.891 --> 02:38:09.752]  Very impressed, Terry.
[02:38:09.752 --> 02:38:13.974]  All right, Buzz, you now want to get into the indictment of Trump, because the quiz is over.
[02:38:13.974 --> 02:38:14.795]  Buzz, go ahead.
[02:38:14.795 --> 02:38:16.315]  Pennsylvania.
[02:38:16.315 --> 02:38:16.936]  Alex Jones.
[02:38:17.512 --> 02:38:19.112]  God, strike me down right now.
[02:38:19.112 --> 02:38:22.973]  I swear to God, I had the exact answer that your previous caller just answered.
[02:38:22.973 --> 02:38:23.474]  Congratulations.
[02:38:23.474 --> 02:38:26.814]  Well, that shows how smart the audience is, so give us your take on that.
[02:38:26.814 --> 02:38:31.175]  Well, yeah, I just wanted to add a few extra points to it.
[02:38:31.175 --> 02:38:35.557]  It is a fact that they're preparing, ramping up the next thing, but it's bigger than that.
[02:38:35.557 --> 02:38:40.878]  I think they're setting the precedent that they say when a pandemic ends,
[02:38:41.670 --> 02:38:47.494]  When it starts and it's also there's evidence because it's about your power exactly they control it.
[02:38:47.494 --> 02:38:49.996]  Hey, you get a t-shirt and a book to get his name and number.
[02:38:49.996 --> 02:38:51.857]  Sorry.
[02:38:51.857 --> 02:38:52.617]  No, I believe you.
[02:38:52.617 --> 02:38:53.298]  I believe you.
[02:38:53.298 --> 02:38:54.198]  I believe you have the answer.
[02:38:54.198 --> 02:38:57.420]  So you're gonna get the price to go ahead.
[02:38:57.420 --> 02:38:58.021]  Thanks, brother.
[02:38:58.021 --> 02:38:59.182]  I appreciate that.
[02:38:59.182 --> 02:39:04.345]  But no, I wanted to say because the WHO changed or no the US Senate gave
[02:39:04.966 --> 02:39:17.936]  Complete control to the WHO by signing over the pandemic treaty right and changing the name from a treaty to an accord, thereby advocating our responsibility to declare when pandemics start.
[02:39:17.936 --> 02:39:18.477]  Exactly!
[02:39:18.477 --> 02:39:23.701]  They're testing their power to say when one starts and when... and that's the sub answer.
[02:39:23.701 --> 02:39:25.382]  The main answer is they're getting ready for a new one.
[02:39:25.382 --> 02:39:28.225]  They want to declare victory that they beat the last thing to pose as saviors.
[02:39:28.225 --> 02:39:32.488]  But the second corollary issue is they want to declare when a pandemic happens and be in control of it.
[02:39:33.467 --> 02:39:39.391]  Yeah, but here's a quote that I found on an article from this one doctor who was represented by the WHO.
[02:39:39.391 --> 02:39:46.415]  He said, the danger of keeping it forever, meaning the pandemic, is diluting the tool.
[02:39:46.415 --> 02:39:48.596]  You need it to retain its force.
[02:39:48.596 --> 02:39:52.819]  So basically, they were moving the tool to keep the power there, essentially.
[02:39:52.819 --> 02:39:53.139]  Exactly.
[02:39:53.139 --> 02:39:53.800]  It's a cycle.
[02:39:53.800 --> 02:39:55.541]  They've got to cycle on, cycle off.
[02:39:55.541 --> 02:39:56.361]  Exactly.
[02:39:56.361 --> 02:40:00.263]  Which signals the end of this, and they're reloading for the next attack.
[02:40:00.263 --> 02:40:00.804]  Absolutely.
[02:40:01.901 --> 02:40:02.642]  That's it.
[02:40:02.642 --> 02:40:03.783]  I'm very impressed.
[02:40:03.783 --> 02:40:04.704]  I'm going to put you on hold.
[02:40:04.704 --> 02:40:09.988]  I'm going to put you on hold and get a signed copy of the book and a t-shirt of your choice.
[02:40:09.988 --> 02:40:13.571]  Do you want a Trump political president or an Alex Jones for president?
[02:40:13.571 --> 02:40:15.633]  What would be the option?
[02:40:15.633 --> 02:40:16.814]  We only got two t-shirts right now.
[02:40:16.814 --> 02:40:17.715]  We do limited editions now.
[02:40:17.715 --> 02:40:18.495]  That's it.
[02:40:18.495 --> 02:40:24.800]  Trump political president shirt with a mug shot or Alex Jones for president?
[02:40:24.800 --> 02:40:26.682]  I'll do Alex Jones for president.
[02:40:26.682 --> 02:40:27.543]  All right.
[02:40:27.543 --> 02:40:28.163]  Put him on hold.
[02:40:28.163 --> 02:40:30.005]  Make sure customers... Sorry, go ahead.
[02:40:31.130 --> 02:40:32.631]  You should be president.
[02:40:32.631 --> 02:40:35.472]  Well, it's a fun shirt for thought-provoking stuff.
[02:40:35.472 --> 02:40:37.413]  I'm really impressed right now.
[02:40:37.413 --> 02:40:38.073]  Thank you, Buzz.
[02:40:38.073 --> 02:40:38.894]  Make sure he gets it, okay?
[02:40:38.894 --> 02:40:40.315]  We're gonna start this new thing.
[02:40:40.315 --> 02:40:41.015]  I did it years ago.
[02:40:41.015 --> 02:40:43.016]  We're gonna do it again.
[02:40:43.016 --> 02:40:44.757]  Let's go to Matt in Minnesota.
[02:40:44.757 --> 02:40:45.437]  Matt, you're on the air.
[02:40:45.437 --> 02:40:47.338]  Go ahead.
[02:40:47.338 --> 02:40:48.579]  Hey, thanks, Alex.
[02:40:48.579 --> 02:40:53.401]  Just to piggyback off what everyone else was saying, I think a lot of us share the same thought process.
[02:40:53.401 --> 02:40:55.602]  I definitely was on board with what they're saying.
[02:40:56.351 --> 02:40:59.673]  But it's to show that the World Health Organization and the U.N.
[02:40:59.673 --> 02:41:00.853]  control our governments.
[02:41:00.853 --> 02:41:05.696]  You know, what they say it's over, all the other governments fall in line and say... That's right!
[02:41:05.696 --> 02:41:06.436]  You're right, you're right.
[02:41:06.436 --> 02:41:07.897]  I think it's a dual answer.
[02:41:07.897 --> 02:41:11.579]  It signifies they want to be the savior, saying we beat the last one, but we're in charge of it.
[02:41:11.579 --> 02:41:12.759]  Yeah.
[02:41:12.759 --> 02:41:13.060]  Yep.
[02:41:13.060 --> 02:41:17.942]  So that way they know, hey, we do have all the control over these governments because we said it and they're doing it.
[02:41:17.942 --> 02:41:19.663]  So we have all the right controls in place.
[02:41:21.294 --> 02:41:21.934]  Yeah.
[02:41:21.934 --> 02:41:25.055]  Yeah, I think that's a dual, I think that's a dual accurate answer.
[02:41:25.055 --> 02:41:27.396]  So you get a free book and a t-shirt too.
[02:41:27.396 --> 02:41:29.617]  You know, I gotta be honest with you, I already have the book.
[02:41:29.617 --> 02:41:32.618]  You know, I went out and got a signed copy as soon as they were available.
[02:41:32.618 --> 02:41:34.419]  So what free gift do you want?
[02:41:34.419 --> 02:41:36.319]  Because you didn't answer it.
[02:41:36.319 --> 02:41:39.601]  You want a bottle of, how about a bottle of X3?
[02:41:39.601 --> 02:41:40.461]  I think you surprised me.
[02:41:40.461 --> 02:41:42.462]  You know, I have iodine.
[02:41:42.462 --> 02:41:45.923]  I usually do vitamin, mineral, you know, but whatever you... You want a Turbo Force?
[02:41:47.205 --> 02:41:48.006]  Sure, that sounds great.
[02:41:48.006 --> 02:41:51.849]  Alright, put him on hold, get his name and number, his address, get him a turboforce.
[02:41:51.849 --> 02:41:55.272]  We've got a minute to break, what else do you want to say, smart guy?
[02:41:55.272 --> 02:42:00.397]  Um, you know, just thank you for everything you do, and is it okay if I plug somebody else that you guys carry on bandwagon videos?
[02:42:00.397 --> 02:42:01.818]  Sure, sure.
[02:42:01.818 --> 02:42:04.500]  Um, you know, I love your show, I love Owen Schroyer.
[02:42:04.500 --> 02:42:06.402]  I love all the shows, that's why we love it.
[02:42:06.402 --> 02:42:07.883]  Who isn't?
[02:42:07.883 --> 02:42:13.849]  But if you need a little bit of extra macroaggressions, Charlie Robinson is fantastic, and it's just an hour
[02:42:14.614 --> 02:42:23.881]  You know, I think it is two one-hour episodes a week, so it's, you know, a good little supplement when you need a little bit of extra to listen to when you've listened to all the other InfoWars shows.
[02:42:23.881 --> 02:42:25.022]  He's really great.
[02:42:25.022 --> 02:42:26.363]  I will check it out, Matt.
[02:42:26.363 --> 02:42:28.404]  All right, get Matt's address.
[02:42:28.404 --> 02:42:32.927]  Bottle or canister of Turbo Force for him.
[02:42:32.927 --> 02:42:33.948]  Very impressed.
[02:42:33.948 --> 02:42:35.870]  All right, I always pronounce names wrong.
[02:42:35.870 --> 02:42:38.772]  I can barely speak English.
[02:42:38.772 --> 02:42:40.773]  Yusumbo?
[02:42:40.773 --> 02:42:41.734]  Is that right how I said it?
[02:42:44.790 --> 02:42:55.909]  Eusabio, Eusabio in Tennessee coming right back to you and then Michael and Derek and Cindy and then the next big guest host takes over, Jay Dyer.
[02:42:58.166 --> 02:43:04.430]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution is laying right there in front of you, hidden in plain view.
[02:43:04.430 --> 02:43:07.392]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[02:43:07.392 --> 02:43:16.938]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website where they admit the number one cause of cognitive disability in the world is iodine deficiency.
[02:43:16.938 --> 02:43:18.900]  The number one preventable cause
[02:43:19.620 --> 02:43:30.503]  of intellectual disability is lack of real pure iodine in the body as they bomb us with the bad halogens bromine, bromide, chlorine and so much more.
[02:43:30.503 --> 02:43:40.445]  Upwards of 2 billion people in a Lancet medical journal study in 2007 worldwide have cognitive disabilities because they don't have high quality iodine.
[02:43:40.445 --> 02:43:42.806]  Most iodine is bound to other elements you don't absorb it.
[02:43:42.806 --> 02:43:45.867]  We have X3 all three types of good iodine together
[02:43:46.607 --> 02:43:48.628]  This is their big move.
[02:43:48.628 --> 02:43:53.790]  So, yeah, you say, why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States?
[02:43:53.790 --> 02:43:54.930]  He doesn't care.
[02:43:54.930 --> 02:43:56.191]  That's not his job.
[02:43:56.191 --> 02:43:58.992]  He's not the president of the United States.
[02:43:58.992 --> 02:44:01.253]  He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[02:44:16.522 --> 02:44:21.027]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased.
[02:44:21.027 --> 02:44:22.169]  They must be opposed.
[02:44:22.902 --> 02:44:26.184]  Autocrats only understand one word.
[02:44:26.184 --> 02:44:27.364]  No.
[02:44:27.364 --> 02:44:28.205]  No.
[02:44:28.205 --> 02:44:28.965]  No.
[02:44:28.965 --> 02:44:29.865]  Exactly.
[02:44:29.865 --> 02:44:33.427]  And that's why we say no to your vaccines.
[02:44:33.427 --> 02:44:36.528]  We say no to you shutting down our businesses.
[02:44:36.528 --> 02:44:39.010]  We say no to you taking our firearms.
[02:44:39.010 --> 02:44:41.511]  We say no to you censoring our free speech.
[02:44:41.511 --> 02:44:45.133]  We say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization.
[02:44:45.133 --> 02:44:47.654]  We say no to you getting us into World War III.
[02:44:47.654 --> 02:44:48.054]  You're right.
[02:44:48.334 --> 02:44:53.086]  We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden, and we say no!
[02:44:53.086 --> 02:44:54.650]  And we say no to your war!
[02:44:58.024 --> 02:45:05.448]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into the atmosphere.
[02:45:05.448 --> 02:45:08.250]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[02:45:08.250 --> 02:45:16.615]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers to convert these gases into fluorosilicic acid.
[02:45:16.615 --> 02:45:19.036]  Still highly toxic, but containable.
[02:45:19.036 --> 02:45:22.038]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison.
[02:45:22.338 --> 02:45:24.920]  And there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[02:45:24.920 --> 02:45:33.327]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the Secretary of the Treasury, who was responsible for the Public Health Service at the time.
[02:45:33.327 --> 02:45:35.188]  And by 1950, the U.S.
[02:45:35.188 --> 02:45:42.274]  government began buying this toxic, untreated, industrial waste product and dumping it into our drinking water.
[02:45:42.274 --> 02:45:47.478]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[02:45:47.478 --> 02:45:50.881]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water.
[02:45:51.162 --> 02:45:53.569]  And a remedy to this madness.
[02:45:53.569 --> 02:45:56.559]  Available now at InfoWarsTore.com
[02:45:57.867 --> 02:46:02.890]  Turbo Force is back, sold out for eight months, and it's Turbo Force Plus.
[02:46:02.890 --> 02:46:05.052]  We made it even stronger.
[02:46:05.052 --> 02:46:08.634]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[02:46:08.634 --> 02:46:15.539]  Turbo Force is back in stock at Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:46:15.539 --> 02:46:21.623]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[02:46:21.623 --> 02:46:23.064]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[02:46:23.704 --> 02:46:36.771]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[02:46:36.771 --> 02:46:38.772]  It is the super fuel.
[02:46:38.772 --> 02:46:40.252]  RainForce Plus is great.
[02:46:40.252 --> 02:46:41.093]  RainForce Ultra is great.
[02:46:41.093 --> 02:46:42.073]  They're two different nootropics.
[02:46:42.073 --> 02:46:43.254]  They go good with this.
[02:46:43.254 --> 02:46:45.275]  But this is the King Kong.
[02:46:45.996 --> 02:46:47.498]  This is the Boss.
[02:46:47.498 --> 02:46:48.219]  TurboForce.
[02:46:48.219 --> 02:46:49.240]  Back in stock.
[02:46:49.240 --> 02:46:50.261]  Discounted.
[02:46:50.261 --> 02:46:51.983]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:46:51.983 --> 02:46:52.844]  More power.
[02:46:52.844 --> 02:46:53.845]  More strength.
[02:46:53.845 --> 02:46:58.571]  More energy.
[02:46:58.571 --> 02:47:03.176]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:47:03.176 --> 02:47:04.478]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:47:30.143 --> 02:47:56.220]  Fire's in their eyes and their words aren't really clear So beat it, just beat it You better run, you better do what you can Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man You wanna be tough, better do what you can So beat it, but you wanna be fair Just beat it, beat it No one wants to beat it, beat it
[02:48:04.193 --> 02:48:08.903]  Just beat it!
[02:48:08.903 --> 02:48:10.366]  Just beat it!
[02:48:10.366 --> 02:48:11.067]  Just beat it!
[02:48:21.913 --> 02:48:26.016]  Beat it!
[02:48:26.016 --> 02:48:30.840]  Beat the New World Order!
[02:48:30.840 --> 02:48:40.447]  No one wants to be defeated!
[02:48:56.558 --> 02:49:04.862]  Alright, we are back live broadcasting worldwide on this Friday transmission.
[02:49:04.862 --> 02:49:06.202]  I'm going to be up here tomorrow working.
[02:49:06.202 --> 02:49:07.163]  I'm not sure we're doing a live show.
[02:49:07.163 --> 02:49:09.924]  I've got a bunch of interviews, but just look for that at InfoWars.com.
[02:49:11.223 --> 02:49:14.384]  I'm going to go back to the callers, but I'm not buttering up the listeners.
[02:49:14.384 --> 02:49:19.327]  I didn't think when we took like 10, 15 calls, one person would get the answer, much less in the first few calls.
[02:49:19.327 --> 02:49:21.768]  Very, very amazing.
[02:49:21.768 --> 02:49:26.030]  But I said it's my opinion this is why they're doing it, which is a big part of us.
[02:49:26.030 --> 02:49:28.651]  There's a lot of other reasons in their calculus they did it.
[02:49:28.651 --> 02:49:32.113]  And then three callers, including the guy that got it, the next two said,
[02:49:32.873 --> 02:49:38.794]  Very eloquently, but it's really about them being in charge of the UN and saying when the pandemic begins and when it ends.
[02:49:38.794 --> 02:49:41.195]  And I really thought, wow, that's just as important.
[02:49:41.195 --> 02:49:42.235]  That's the main two reasons.
[02:49:42.235 --> 02:49:43.635]  That's why I gave them prizes.
[02:49:43.635 --> 02:49:45.016]  Because they taught me.
[02:49:45.016 --> 02:49:47.556]  That's why I took the calls.
[02:49:47.556 --> 02:49:49.257]  I didn't think of that.
[02:49:49.257 --> 02:49:51.357]  And that's the synergy of humanity.
[02:49:51.357 --> 02:49:55.318]  I was seeing and telling the family when they declare an end to it, they want to say they're the saviors.
[02:49:55.318 --> 02:49:56.278]  That means the next one's coming.
[02:49:56.278 --> 02:49:59.859]  But it's also about them being in charge of when they say what happens when one ends.
[02:50:03.257 --> 02:50:05.518]  That's why we take the calls.
[02:50:05.518 --> 02:50:07.079]  That's impressive.
[02:50:07.079 --> 02:50:09.461]  Incredible.
[02:50:09.461 --> 02:50:14.824]  I mean, average talk radio is smarter than the general public, but my God, that was incredible.
[02:50:14.824 --> 02:50:18.626]  I mean, I am just in awe of this audience.
[02:50:18.626 --> 02:50:20.107]  All right, how do I pronounce the person from Tennessee?
[02:50:20.107 --> 02:50:24.209]  You know I'm stupid.
[02:50:24.209 --> 02:50:25.570]  Osablo, am I saying that right?
[02:50:25.570 --> 02:50:25.970]  I'm sorry.
[02:50:25.970 --> 02:50:26.711]  From Tennessee, go ahead.
[02:50:27.643 --> 02:50:37.831]  Yeah, just to let you know, basically my name was after the guy who influenced the Emperor Constantine back in ancient Rome to convert to Christianity.
[02:50:37.831 --> 02:50:44.636]  That guy's name was Eusebius of Caesarea, so they named me after that guy.
[02:50:44.636 --> 02:50:53.023]  Alright, so first of all, I just want to say it's an honor and a privilege to speak with you, Alex, and I want to say you woke me up in 2010 when I saw your documentary with Joel Skousen
[02:50:57.657 --> 02:50:59.458]  Strategic relocation.
[02:50:59.458 --> 02:51:08.141]  It so blew me away that I had to look up every last word that both of you guys uttered in that documentary.
[02:51:08.141 --> 02:51:12.902]  And it just sent me on a trip that's not ended today.
[02:51:12.902 --> 02:51:15.023]  It's scary how smart Joel Skousen is.
[02:51:15.023 --> 02:51:17.284]  Like, every damn thing he says is true.
[02:51:17.284 --> 02:51:18.404]  And you're like, the guy's a brainiac.
[02:51:21.363 --> 02:51:22.784]  Yeah, absolutely my book.
[02:51:22.784 --> 02:51:26.726]  So, by the way, I happen to be a board certified psychiatrist with 32 years experience.
[02:51:26.726 --> 02:51:28.548]  I hope you don't hold that against me.
[02:51:28.548 --> 02:51:32.110]  You said 30 years experience at what?
[02:51:32.110 --> 02:51:35.272]  Yeah, as a board certified psychiatrist.
[02:51:35.272 --> 02:51:36.993]  No, that's okay, brother.
[02:51:36.993 --> 02:51:38.934]  We got good psychiatrists and we got bad ones.
[02:51:38.934 --> 02:51:40.075]  We got good cops, we got bad ones.
[02:51:40.075 --> 02:51:40.355]  Go ahead.
[02:51:41.135 --> 02:51:44.498]  I actually listen to all the stuff you say about mental health issues and whatnot.
[02:51:44.498 --> 02:51:46.379]  I want you to know you're totally spot on.
[02:51:46.379 --> 02:51:48.901]  What are you seeing with marijuana, man?
[02:51:48.901 --> 02:51:50.723]  So many friends of mine have gone crazy.
[02:51:50.723 --> 02:51:52.604]  It's so strong now.
[02:51:52.604 --> 02:52:01.091]  Well, you've actually commented on this many times, which is that all bets are off when anybody uses anything from the street.
[02:52:01.091 --> 02:52:02.692]  You can throw anything in there.
[02:52:03.223 --> 02:52:06.205]  You know, rat poison, you name it.
[02:52:06.205 --> 02:52:09.848]  I tell people all the time, stay away from anything that comes through the street like that.
[02:52:09.848 --> 02:52:14.412]  Hell, even prescription medications, amphetamines and the like.
[02:52:14.412 --> 02:52:17.714]  They will throw you straight into the hospital with an acute psychotic break.
[02:52:17.714 --> 02:52:23.899]  Listen, Alex, I wanted to tag, if I may, onto what the other folks said because
[02:52:25.509 --> 02:52:27.691]  This is such an important topic.
[02:52:27.691 --> 02:52:31.273]  I just wanted to throw my two cents in there for whatever it's worth.
[02:52:31.273 --> 02:52:32.434]  Can you still hear me okay?
[02:52:32.434 --> 02:52:33.014]  I can, go ahead.
[02:52:33.014 --> 02:52:34.715]  Alright, great.
[02:52:34.715 --> 02:52:41.280]  So, regarding that question, you know, the reasons for ending the pandemic, I'm just going to give you, you know, a quick blurb.
[02:52:41.280 --> 02:52:49.105]  So, the first reason is, first of all, and by the way, everything I'm about to say is overwhelmingly stuff you've already said, alright?
[02:52:49.105 --> 02:52:49.586]  So, here goes.
[02:52:50.245 --> 02:52:54.229]  I'm going to kind of channel Alex Jones right now.
[02:52:54.229 --> 02:52:57.652]  So the first one is, COVID was only the beta test.
[02:52:57.652 --> 02:52:59.473]  They already accomplished their main goal.
[02:52:59.473 --> 02:53:03.737]  They didn't accomplish everything they wanted there, but they accomplished the main goal.
[02:53:03.737 --> 02:53:09.142]  Secondarily, very closely related to that, they did the damage.
[02:53:09.142 --> 02:53:10.964]  It's a slow train wreck.
[02:53:10.964 --> 02:53:13.146]  You know, it's a soft kill.
[02:53:13.146 --> 02:53:14.627]  It's already bringing down the economy.
[02:53:15.785 --> 02:53:16.445]  Correct.
[02:53:16.445 --> 02:53:18.606]  So, I'm not going to expound on that.
[02:53:18.606 --> 02:53:22.788]  You've already elaborated on that, you know, tremendously, many times.
[02:53:22.788 --> 02:53:27.910]  So, the damage is already done and it's going to continue to go, so they don't need to keep this thing going.
[02:53:27.910 --> 02:53:35.712]  Thirdly, they know that the public has reached some sort of critical mass the world over.
[02:53:35.712 --> 02:53:42.275]  And since the masses are onto the, you know, shots, compliance is plummeting.
[02:53:43.215 --> 02:53:56.400]  Then related to that, they're backing off because if they don't, they're concerned that the masses are going to basically cross some sort of threshold and they're going to do like what's going on in France right now.
[02:53:56.400 --> 02:53:59.761]  They're going to overthrow the control structure and they can't have that.
[02:53:59.761 --> 02:53:59.941]  I agree.
[02:53:59.941 --> 02:54:03.402]  They push as far as they can and then back off and prepare the new attack.
[02:54:03.402 --> 02:54:04.042]  Great points.
[02:54:04.042 --> 02:54:05.383]  God bless you.
[02:54:05.383 --> 02:54:08.384]  All right, let's talk to Derek in Kentucky and then Cindy in Delaware.
[02:54:08.384 --> 02:54:08.884]  Go ahead, Derek.
[02:54:10.285 --> 02:54:12.086]  Alex, it's an honor to be here.
[02:54:12.086 --> 02:54:14.406]  I've been listening to you since 2006.
[02:54:14.406 --> 02:54:19.408]  I'm a health freedom advocate, so you really drew me in.
[02:54:19.408 --> 02:54:26.810]  You're one of the most prominent voices talking about Big Pharma and how they were basically taking over every aspect of our lives.
[02:54:26.810 --> 02:54:32.192]  And as far as the big question, I think y'all had a pretty good outlay of it.
[02:54:32.192 --> 02:54:34.812]  I believe that it is mission accomplished.
[02:54:34.812 --> 02:54:39.674]  It's their mission accomplished moment where they can just declare victory while playing damage control.
[02:54:40.334 --> 02:54:42.436]  And then they've already used the Trojan horse.
[02:54:42.436 --> 02:54:43.577]  Why do they need it anymore?
[02:54:43.577 --> 02:54:45.078]  They've already gotten through.
[02:54:45.078 --> 02:54:47.901]  They've already established their systems of control.
[02:54:47.901 --> 02:54:51.384]  They've done as much as they can do with that tool for now.
[02:54:51.384 --> 02:54:53.665]  So they're going to put it on the back burner.
[02:54:53.665 --> 02:54:55.887]  They're still maintaining all the emergency powers.
[02:54:55.887 --> 02:54:58.850]  It's still in their pocket to bring out any time in the future.
[02:54:59.574 --> 02:55:01.536]  I'm calling on a very important matter.
[02:55:20.060 --> 02:55:22.602]  I'm facing trial in the state of Kentucky.
[02:55:22.602 --> 02:55:27.226]  I presented myself as a whistleblower in the very beginning of this to the police department.
[02:55:27.226 --> 02:55:29.608]  I wanted a criminal investigation.
[02:55:29.608 --> 02:55:32.470]  I believe that a crime has been committed against us.
[02:55:32.470 --> 02:55:35.032]  Our constitutional rights have been violated.
[02:55:35.032 --> 02:55:37.655]  And so they came after you for that?
[02:55:37.655 --> 02:55:39.476]  No, they wouldn't listen to me.
[02:55:39.476 --> 02:55:41.077]  The police departments were closed.
[02:55:41.077 --> 02:55:45.181]  The courts were closed during COVID under the state of emergency.
[02:55:45.181 --> 02:55:47.443]  So basically our constitutional rights were suspended.
[02:55:47.443 --> 02:55:48.924]  And they did that to have the crime explode.
[02:55:50.661 --> 02:56:00.003]  Yeah, and the rates of crime exploded in my community and you can't even get a police officer to come out for a report on burglary.
[02:56:00.003 --> 02:56:07.365]  And they have trials that are backed up two years for all sorts of issues because they closed our courts down.
[02:56:07.365 --> 02:56:12.866]  And so I was trying to petition for redress of grievance, which is our constitutional right, but there is no
[02:56:13.649 --> 02:56:22.995]  Well, the big part of that is by having the police stand down, the prosecutors are almost all Soros, then they can commit all those resources to go after the American people.
[02:56:22.995 --> 02:56:23.756]  And they did.
[02:56:23.756 --> 02:56:25.637]  They came after me big time.
[02:56:25.637 --> 02:56:33.002]  I was posting letters of public indictment taped to the sides of the media operations and the police department.
[02:56:33.002 --> 02:56:34.183]  So what are you facing trial for?
[02:56:34.183 --> 02:56:35.284]  Tell us your name, what's happening.
[02:56:36.041 --> 02:56:47.230]  My name's Derek Nance, and I'm facing trial for criminal mischief, because in order to get attention to the, you know, Protestant Reformation, you nail the protestation to the doors of the establishment.
[02:56:47.230 --> 02:56:48.852]  It's the most ancient form of protest.
[02:56:48.852 --> 02:56:49.592]  Sure, so what happened?
[02:56:49.592 --> 02:56:49.933]  What'd they do?
[02:56:50.712 --> 02:56:54.716]  And they basically sent the Department of Homeland Security after me.
[02:56:54.716 --> 02:56:59.040]  They did forensic analysis on the Christmas cards that I was sending the detectives.
[02:56:59.040 --> 02:57:02.083]  I was playing Richard Kimball, leaving evidence at the crime scene.
[02:57:02.083 --> 02:57:05.807]  Just like they sent Homeland Security after the parents protesting critical race theory at the school boards.
[02:57:06.613 --> 02:57:06.853]  Right.
[02:57:06.853 --> 02:57:12.235]  It's outrageous they spent that much resources to track down a man for posting letters of indictment.
[02:57:12.235 --> 02:57:14.475]  Because they weren't helping old ladies getting raped and robbed.
[02:57:14.475 --> 02:57:15.896]  Brothers, send me a letter.
[02:57:15.896 --> 02:57:16.396]  Let me know.
[02:57:16.396 --> 02:57:17.276]  I want to cover your story.
[02:57:17.276 --> 02:57:18.196]  All right.
[02:57:18.196 --> 02:57:19.397]  Final segment.
[02:57:19.397 --> 02:57:20.757]  First segment of the next hour.
[02:57:20.757 --> 02:57:22.117]  Cindy, you're up.
[02:57:22.117 --> 02:57:25.078]  And then Jay Dyer is an incredible researcher.
[02:57:25.078 --> 02:57:26.318]  Everybody needs to stay tuned.
[02:57:26.318 --> 02:57:27.719]  Watch it and share it.
[02:57:27.719 --> 02:57:29.819]  This whole show will be posted to be in a video tomorrow.
[02:57:29.819 --> 02:57:30.580]  I'll be here at the office.
[02:57:30.580 --> 02:57:33.060]  I haven't decided if I'm going to go live or take a special show.
[02:57:33.060 --> 02:57:34.101]  I'm doing some interviews.
[02:57:34.101 --> 02:57:35.001]  But I'll be up here.
[02:57:35.988 --> 02:57:37.592]  Beavering away against the enemy.
[02:57:37.592 --> 02:57:39.937]  And it's Sunday, if I'm not dead, 4 p.m.
[02:57:39.937 --> 02:57:41.421]  Central with the Sunday Show.
[02:57:41.421 --> 02:57:43.125]  Hour number four, straight ahead.
[02:57:43.125 --> 02:57:43.586]  Stay with us.
[02:57:47.944 --> 02:57:50.526]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[02:57:50.526 --> 02:57:52.787]  Please write this down and please go look this up.
[02:57:52.787 --> 02:57:54.788]  It will change your life.
[02:57:54.788 --> 02:58:03.534]  The UN admits, and the Lancet Medical Journal admits, that upwards of 2 billion people have mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities.
[02:58:03.534 --> 02:58:08.858]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[02:58:08.858 --> 02:58:10.339]  Most iodine in the environment
[02:58:11.039 --> 02:58:14.582]  is bound to other elements so your body can't absorb it.
[02:58:14.582 --> 02:58:19.046]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[02:58:19.046 --> 02:58:26.132]  And InfoWarStore.com has the only iodine out there that actually has this type of full effect.
[02:58:26.132 --> 02:58:32.137]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3's been sold out for six months, it's very hard to produce, and it's finally back in stock.
[02:58:32.697 --> 02:58:35.059]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[02:58:35.059 --> 02:58:37.321]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is powerful.
[02:58:37.321 --> 02:58:39.123]  You and your family need it.
[02:58:39.123 --> 02:58:40.864]  It's 25% off back in stock.
[02:58:40.864 --> 02:58:45.088]  X3 Tri-Iodine, exclusively at InfoWarstore.com.
[02:58:45.088 --> 02:58:47.530]  Take action now, but regardless, research is info.
[02:58:48.089 --> 02:58:54.073]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the Globalists were going to move against Tucker Carlson and take him off the air.
[02:58:54.073 --> 02:58:56.735]  People said, no way, he's the most powerful thing that ever happened.
[02:58:56.735 --> 02:58:58.916]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[02:58:58.916 --> 02:59:01.498]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him.
[02:59:01.498 --> 02:59:04.720]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[02:59:04.720 --> 02:59:06.501]  It's the same thing with Infowars.
[02:59:06.501 --> 02:59:13.126]  But Infowars is not owned by Fox, or controlled by George Soros, or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[02:59:13.126 --> 02:59:15.908]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[02:59:16.877 --> 02:59:18.979]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[02:59:18.979 --> 02:59:23.625]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[02:59:23.625 --> 02:59:27.349]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[02:59:27.349 --> 02:59:30.472]  So I want to thank you for your support and encourage your listeners to understand.
[02:59:30.472 --> 02:59:33.035]  Please don't take InfoWars for granted.
[02:59:33.035 --> 02:59:34.397]  We're barely hanging on.
[02:59:34.397 --> 02:59:35.438]  We need your word of mouth.
[02:59:35.698 --> 02:59:40.162]  Your prayer, your financial support, while getting great products at the same time at MFootwearShore.com.
[02:59:40.162 --> 02:59:49.529]  So don't procrastinate, go to MFootwearShore.com, get amazing products that keep us on the air, and never submit to these tyrants.
[02:59:49.529 --> 02:59:55.414]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:01.052 --> 03:00:04.794]  Hey Alex, you know what I think is going on?
[03:00:31.195 --> 03:00:37.238]  We know that they plan all these pandemics and everything they do way ahead of time, okay?
[03:00:37.238 --> 03:00:45.461]  One of the things they're trying to do is they're trying to make all medicine, all medical care from the top down.
[03:00:45.461 --> 03:00:48.922]  They want to be the ones to tell you what you're going to take, what you're not allowed to take.
[03:00:48.922 --> 03:00:50.223]  Yeah, that's why they're trying to ban all the therapeutics.
[03:00:51.021 --> 03:00:51.801]  That's right.
[03:00:51.801 --> 03:01:02.145]  Now, if the World Health Organization really cared about people, why are there so many poisons allowed in our food here in the United States?
[03:01:02.145 --> 03:01:04.665]  Ones that aren't allowed in other countries, right?
[03:01:04.665 --> 03:01:06.006]  They don't care about that.
[03:01:06.006 --> 03:01:10.967]  But I think, just like this Geagle report, I think they try and pick and choose.
[03:01:10.967 --> 03:01:12.428]  They're farming us, alright?
[03:01:13.240 --> 03:01:14.220]  They are farming us.
[03:01:14.220 --> 03:01:22.584]  They're trying to decide what countries are going to prosper, where the sickness is going to be, who's going to survive.
[03:01:22.584 --> 03:01:27.165]  And this next pandemic, they're going to have the cure.
[03:01:27.165 --> 03:01:32.147]  They're going to tell people they have the cure, just like the jab was supposed to be the cure.
[03:01:32.147 --> 03:01:34.708]  And people are going to fall for it.
[03:01:34.708 --> 03:01:38.290]  Sounds like it's going to be Marburg or some deadly flu or something.
[03:01:38.290 --> 03:01:41.231]  But the main thing people can do now is get
[03:01:42.336 --> 03:01:48.778]  Ivermectin, NAC, lots of vitamin C, zinc, the whole thing.
[03:01:48.778 --> 03:01:53.300]  We've seen what happens with their run through.
[03:01:53.300 --> 03:01:54.800]  Now we have to be prepared for the next one.
[03:01:54.800 --> 03:01:55.480]  I totally agree with you.
[03:01:55.480 --> 03:01:58.361]  What else is going to happen?
[03:01:58.361 --> 03:01:59.342]  Lockdowns.
[03:01:59.342 --> 03:02:01.022]  They're going to have major lockdowns.
[03:02:01.022 --> 03:02:03.903]  The other thing is, make sure you have plenty of food.
[03:02:03.903 --> 03:02:09.065]  A way to purify your water.
[03:02:09.065 --> 03:02:09.485]  It's on.
[03:02:11.869 --> 03:02:12.749]  I totally agree with you.
[03:02:12.749 --> 03:02:16.910]  What did you think about my question of why they're declaring the end of the pandemic?
[03:02:16.910 --> 03:02:22.451]  I was seeing it as a way to pose as the saviors and say they beat the last one, so do what we say on the next one.
[03:02:22.451 --> 03:02:25.851]  I think that's the paramount thing, but secondarily, I agree with the callers.
[03:02:25.851 --> 03:02:28.872]  It's also so they tell you when there's a pandemic and when there isn't.
[03:02:28.872 --> 03:02:30.312]  They're in charge.
[03:02:30.312 --> 03:02:31.592]  That's it.
[03:02:31.592 --> 03:02:37.253]  It's also that they're acclimating the people to who's in charge, who's calling it, you know?
[03:02:37.253 --> 03:02:40.514]  I mean, look how people bounce down to this last one.
[03:02:41.745 --> 03:02:44.166]  And this was just a trial run.
[03:02:44.166 --> 03:02:49.948]  And they also want to get us used to the idea of patterns.
[03:02:49.948 --> 03:02:53.409]  You know, there's a pattern to all of these epidemics.
[03:02:53.409 --> 03:02:54.429]  We got over this one.
[03:02:54.429 --> 03:02:58.311]  Now there's going to be another one.
[03:02:58.311 --> 03:02:59.611]  And they've said there's going to be another one.
[03:02:59.611 --> 03:03:01.132]  Thank you so much, Cindy.
[03:03:01.132 --> 03:03:01.932]  All right, Jay Dyer.
[03:03:03.086 --> 03:03:06.649]  He's a best-selling author and researcher, has a degree in studying media.
[03:03:06.649 --> 03:03:11.033]  One of the smartest people out there about giving you the core documents from the enemy.
[03:03:11.033 --> 03:03:12.034]  He's about to take over.
[03:03:12.034 --> 03:03:15.917]  But I noticed, again, I was trending at the top of Twitter yesterday, and they're promoting this video.
[03:03:15.917 --> 03:03:18.079]  They take down as fast as it goes up.
[03:03:18.079 --> 03:03:19.300]  The whole video is like an hour long.
[03:03:19.300 --> 03:03:24.645]  This is about a minute and a half when we come back, where I predicted in 2002 exactly what would happen when the takeover happened.
[03:03:25.165 --> 03:03:31.293]  So we're going to play that clip, we'll come back, and then Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis will be taking over today.
[03:03:31.293 --> 03:03:37.801]  And then in one hour, like 57 minutes from now, Owen Schroer, 3 p.m.
[03:03:37.801 --> 03:03:38.602]  Central.
[03:03:38.602 --> 03:03:42.026]  And yes, next week we're going to the border with Title 42 collapsing.
[03:03:42.026 --> 03:03:43.308]  We'll be down there.
[03:03:43.308 --> 03:03:43.868]  I'll be down there.
[03:03:44.940 --> 03:03:48.761]  We'll always have a crew member down there in the next few weeks because this is a bomb going off.
[03:03:48.761 --> 03:03:50.802]  This is... I think the border was broken before.
[03:03:50.802 --> 03:03:54.184]  This is the complete collapse of the border we'll be covering in here.
[03:03:54.184 --> 03:03:56.164]  All the while we stay on air is your word of mouth.
[03:03:56.164 --> 03:03:59.806]  Just as important as buying the product and spreading the word is praying for the broadcast.
[03:03:59.806 --> 03:04:00.126]  Please.
[03:04:01.820 --> 03:04:02.400]  Pray for me.
[03:04:02.400 --> 03:04:03.061]  Pray for the crew.
[03:04:03.061 --> 03:04:03.781]  Pray for the operation.
[03:04:03.781 --> 03:04:04.942]  Pray for our discernment.
[03:04:04.942 --> 03:04:06.183]  Pray for a hedge of protection.
[03:04:06.183 --> 03:04:10.847]  Please say, God, InfoWars isn't perfect, but we love InfoWars, and InfoWars loves you.
[03:04:10.847 --> 03:04:14.369]  Please, Heavenly Father, send angels to protect InfoWars and the crew.
[03:04:14.369 --> 03:04:16.291]  In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.
[03:04:16.291 --> 03:04:18.052]  I need that prayer.
[03:04:18.052 --> 03:04:22.055]  Most important, more than the word of mouth, more than spreading the word, more than buying the product.
[03:04:22.998 --> 03:04:25.341]  Please pray for the broadcast.
[03:04:25.341 --> 03:04:26.502]  It's real.
[03:04:26.502 --> 03:04:29.205]  It's a spiritual war, and you see that now more than ever.
[03:04:29.205 --> 03:04:31.428]  Tucker gets it, and everybody else gets it.
[03:04:31.428 --> 03:04:34.452]  Steven Crowder, and even Joe Rogan's close to understanding it.
[03:04:34.452 --> 03:04:36.814]  It is a spiritual, interdimensional attack.
[03:04:36.814 --> 03:04:37.755]  I need your prayer.
[03:04:37.755 --> 03:04:40.178]  I'm humbly asking you right now.
[03:04:40.919 --> 03:04:46.261]  We're going to break to pray for this broadcast and our provision and our defense and our discernment.
[03:04:46.261 --> 03:04:48.642]  Lead, guide, and direct us in the name of Jesus Christ.
[03:04:48.642 --> 03:04:49.722]  Amen.
[03:04:49.722 --> 03:04:50.562]  Amen.
[03:04:50.562 --> 03:04:51.543]  All right.
[03:04:51.543 --> 03:04:54.724]  Jay Dyer takes over our number four.
[03:04:54.724 --> 03:04:55.704]  Then Owen Schroyer.
[03:04:58.240 --> 03:05:04.883]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mug shot, because they knew that that would help Trump.
[03:05:04.883 --> 03:05:06.823]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[03:05:06.823 --> 03:05:08.324]  We were waiting for the mug shot.
[03:05:08.324 --> 03:05:11.185]  We learned today they wouldn't have it, so we've made our own.
[03:05:11.185 --> 03:05:13.126]  And it says political prisoner.
[03:05:13.926 --> 03:05:15.887]  With an image of President Trump.
[03:05:15.887 --> 03:05:18.328]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[03:05:18.328 --> 03:05:20.468]  It'll be shipping out to you in one week.
[03:05:20.468 --> 03:05:23.850]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front.
[03:05:23.850 --> 03:05:27.051]  There in a mugshot jail background.
[03:05:27.051 --> 03:05:28.111]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[03:05:28.111 --> 03:05:32.233]  It says InfoWars.com on the back of the shirt.
[03:05:32.233 --> 03:05:33.833]  We also have Alex Jones for President.
[03:05:33.833 --> 03:05:34.854]  No, I'm not running for President.
[03:05:34.854 --> 03:05:37.415]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt.
[03:05:37.415 --> 03:05:38.175]  Red, white, and blue.
[03:05:38.175 --> 03:05:39.515]  Alex Jones for President 2024.
[03:05:39.515 --> 03:05:42.617]  It's a fun conversational piece and a limited edition shirt.
[03:05:42.617 --> 03:05:43.377]  Great way to fund.
[03:05:43.757 --> 03:05:54.765]  The operation, so get your Alex Jones for President and Trump mugshot shirts at InfoWarsTore.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[03:05:54.765 --> 03:06:02.650]  Jay Dyer and O.J.'
[03:06:02.550 --> 03:06:04.491]  's analysis of the takeover.
[03:06:04.491 --> 03:06:06.352]  But first, from the time vault.
[03:06:06.352 --> 03:06:11.336]  21 years ago, access television, Alex Jones, predicted what the enemy takeover would look like.
[03:06:13.447 --> 03:06:15.128]  Yes, there have been corrupt empires.
[03:06:15.128 --> 03:06:16.348]  Yes, they manipulate.
[03:06:16.348 --> 03:06:18.389]  Yes, there are secret societies.
[03:06:18.389 --> 03:06:20.789]  Yes, there have been oligarchies throughout history.
[03:06:20.789 --> 03:06:37.515]  And yes, today, in 2002, there is a tyrannical organization calling itself the New World Order, pushing for worldwide government, a cashless society, open borders, total and complete tyranny.
[03:06:38.155 --> 03:06:52.259]  And by creating open borders where there's no national sovereignty and only global bodies that control all the resources, by centralizing and socializing health care, the state becomes God, basically, when it comes to your health.
[03:06:52.259 --> 03:06:59.441]  And then by releasing diseases and viruses and plagues upon us, we then basically get shoved into their system.
[03:06:59.441 --> 03:07:05.883]  The ultimate goal that these people have in mind is the goal to create a one world government.
[03:07:06.937 --> 03:07:08.397]  Run by the banking industry.
[03:07:08.397 --> 03:07:10.278]  Run by the bankers.
[03:07:10.278 --> 03:07:10.438]  Right?
[03:07:10.438 --> 03:07:11.938]  There'll be no more cash.
[03:07:11.938 --> 03:07:13.658]  And this is getting me straight from Rockefeller himself.
[03:07:13.658 --> 03:07:15.679]  This is what they want to accomplish.
[03:07:15.679 --> 03:07:18.079]  And all money will be in your chips.
[03:07:18.079 --> 03:07:24.680]  And, if you're like me or you, and you're protesting what they're doing, they can just turn off your chip.
[03:07:24.680 --> 03:07:25.820]  And you have nothing.
[03:07:25.820 --> 03:07:27.601]  You can't buy food.
[03:07:27.601 --> 03:07:28.621]  You can't do anything.
[03:07:28.621 --> 03:07:29.981]  It's total control of the people.
[03:07:29.981 --> 03:07:34.802]  And that chip's connected to a database that has your purchasing records, what you do... Everything!
[03:07:34.802 --> 03:07:35.702]  Everything is in there.
[03:07:41.454 --> 03:07:43.455]  Welcome to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:07:43.455 --> 03:07:45.716]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer, Jay's analysis.
[03:07:45.716 --> 03:07:57.041]  You know, we were talking last week about the Luciferian initiation that we read about in a lot of the globalist texts, especially the psychonauts.
[03:07:57.041 --> 03:07:59.742]  And I talked about the doors of perception from Huxley.
[03:07:59.742 --> 03:08:08.446]  And there's an amazing essay that was appended to this book that I read last night.
[03:08:08.446 --> 03:08:09.026]  And it's about
[03:08:09.756 --> 03:08:25.800]  His take on drugs and the drug war and all of that, and what the possibilities would be for the usage of drugs in this so-called drug war, and how drugs would actually be the future for controlling society.
[03:08:25.800 --> 03:08:31.962]  So, at the same time as on the one hand admitting that Brave New World is a discussion of a dystopia where everyone's controlled by drugs,
[03:08:32.771 --> 03:08:45.658]  He also says, amazingly, that this drug society would also be freed up and it would be the new type of religion based around mystical direct experience through drugs.
[03:08:45.658 --> 03:08:47.259]  So, which is it?
[03:08:47.259 --> 03:08:55.664]  Is it a dystopia or is it a freeing society based around libertarian do what thou wilt?
[03:08:57.518 --> 03:09:02.321]  But the irony here is, of course, that all of the psychonauts had the same methodology.
[03:09:02.321 --> 03:09:10.546]  And so after reading Doors of Perception, I went ahead and read his other text called Heaven and Hell, which is the second half of this book here, Doors of Perception.
[03:09:10.546 --> 03:09:15.289]  So I want to talk about some of the other psychonauts because he actually lists many of them.
[03:09:15.289 --> 03:09:18.511]  He mentions Dr. John C. Lilly, the Dolphin Creeper.
[03:09:18.511 --> 03:09:22.433]  He mentions the other MKUltra doctors.
[03:09:22.433 --> 03:09:26.896]  And he doesn't say, oh, this is a big conspiracy to change society.
[03:09:28.104 --> 03:09:30.485]  Others of them actually do, though.
[03:09:30.485 --> 03:09:35.146]  He says it's not a conspiracy to change society, it's a way to make everything better.
[03:09:35.146 --> 03:09:45.089]  It's a way to give everybody freedom, to give everybody the holiday that they actually want, which is from their own lives and from reality.
[03:09:45.089 --> 03:09:50.190]  But if we go back to the 1960s, there's clips of, even on YouTube, of Dr. Timothy Leary
[03:09:51.141 --> 03:10:04.712]  Openly saying, as he sits underneath the banner of an Aleister Crowley poster of Christ with 666 above Christ's head, Timothy Leary is saying that he worships and follows and continues the work of Aleister Crowley, the beast.
[03:10:04.712 --> 03:10:14.260]  He says, I'm continuing this work, and he says, if you want to thank anybody for the 1960s counterculture revolution, he says, you may look no further than the CIA, who he was working for.
[03:10:16.056 --> 03:10:24.019]  Other books like Jay Stevens' book, Storming Heaven, talk about the history of utilizing drug warfare as a means of controlling society.
[03:10:24.019 --> 03:10:38.964]  And even though many of these 60s counterculture people thought they were initiating a new society that would be based around more libertarian freedoms and whatnot, it actually was giving way to and steering us towards a brave new world scenario of total control.
[03:10:40.029 --> 03:10:44.950]  And so, you might think, well, is there some connection between... Yeah, that's the clip right there.
[03:10:44.950 --> 03:10:46.531]  There's other clips where he says the same thing.
[03:10:46.531 --> 03:10:49.012]  But what about brain chips?
[03:10:49.012 --> 03:10:50.332]  What about transhumanism?
[03:10:50.332 --> 03:10:54.973]  What about the connection between MKUltra and the 1960s countercryptor?
[03:10:54.973 --> 03:10:56.794]  Well, according to Huxley, it's all there.
[03:10:56.794 --> 03:11:03.756]  In fact, in his essay, at the end of this book, I'm not talking about Heaven and Hell, there's another essay called, The Drugs That Shape Men's Minds.
[03:11:04.699 --> 03:11:13.563]  He says that, you know, the more that we study drugs, the more we were able to understand the psychochemical makeup of mankind.
[03:11:13.563 --> 03:11:21.847]  And of course, he always layers it and masks it in this cloak of giving mankind freedom.
[03:11:21.847 --> 03:11:30.952]  But he starts by saying that if you look at drugs, actually drug studies showed us that you can be born as an addict.
[03:11:30.952 --> 03:11:33.833]  And maybe addiction, he says, maybe addiction is genetic.
[03:11:35.747 --> 03:11:38.509]  Many of these things are actually genetic problems.
[03:11:38.509 --> 03:11:39.389]  And why does that matter?
[03:11:39.389 --> 03:11:56.643]  Well, if you look at his brother's writings, for example, books on revolutionary philosophy that Julian wrote, Julian's book on the philosophy of UNESCO, you notice that they see man as a completely biologically determined entity.
[03:11:57.722 --> 03:12:08.104]  And so, if man is a biologically determined entity, if he's only made up of chemical reactions, then it stands to reason the way you would treat people would be through other chemicals.
[03:12:08.104 --> 03:12:17.866]  So, if man is a psychochemical being, we're going to steer him and control him through external stimuli and psychochemical, psychophysical means.
[03:12:17.866 --> 03:12:21.147]  And that's something that pretty much all of the mKelter doctors held in common.
[03:12:23.849 --> 03:12:32.515]  Huxley is a bit of an outlier on this specific point because he thinks that man isn't solely a physical being.
[03:12:32.515 --> 03:12:46.964]  He doesn't exactly know how to explain it or what's going on with the spiritual realm, but he does say that when people engage in various drug trips and masculine DMT, all these kinds of things, he says that it is tapping into other dimensions and other regions that
[03:12:47.552 --> 03:12:50.675]  Areas of the brain somehow function as gateways to.
[03:12:50.675 --> 03:12:51.596]  That's his view.
[03:12:51.596 --> 03:12:53.117]  So I think that's weird and whatever.
[03:12:53.117 --> 03:12:53.758]  That's his view.
[03:12:53.758 --> 03:12:54.419]  That's what he thinks.
[03:12:54.419 --> 03:12:58.823]  That was part of the point of the essay of Heaven and Hell.
[03:12:58.823 --> 03:13:07.571]  But whether you believe in a spiritual realm or not, the people who he's working with, his compatriots, the other people involved in the M-Culture project,
[03:13:08.425 --> 03:13:16.252]  And I think that as we read this essay, we actually find out that he's absolutely 100% tied up and involved in MKUltra.
[03:13:16.252 --> 03:13:21.337]  He's just in the British version of it, which preceded the American version of it.
[03:13:21.337 --> 03:13:27.783]  And he says that one of the things that comes out of a lot of these mystical experiences is the idea that we are all one.
[03:13:27.783 --> 03:13:28.603]  Monism.
[03:13:28.603 --> 03:13:32.146]  The idea that, oh, we're all one.
[03:13:32.146 --> 03:13:33.027]  Is that the case, though?
[03:13:33.027 --> 03:13:33.668]  Are we all one?
[03:13:34.631 --> 03:13:46.340]  Well, in a lot of these philosophies and these world religions where you have the idea that everybody and everything is ultimately only one, there's this idea that we've got to get rid of all of the things that make us distinct.
[03:13:46.340 --> 03:14:01.052]  And so that's actually a very useful philosophy for the global power structure, because if everything is one, it gives them a basis to say that we've got to erase and destroy all of your unique identifying attributes, cultures, heritage, etc.
[03:14:01.052 --> 03:14:03.654]  Everything must be blended into the global blob.
[03:14:04.517 --> 03:14:19.628]  And believe it or not, Aldous Huxley wrote another book called The Perennial Philosophy, where he argues that the future world religion that's emerging, that will come about, will be a generic syncretic blending of all the religions into a monistic blob.
[03:14:19.628 --> 03:14:20.708]  All is one!
[03:14:20.708 --> 03:14:27.893]  Because when the religious mystics, when they have their mystical experiences, well, they all realize that we're all one, man.
[03:14:27.893 --> 03:14:32.997]  And he says that we could look to the ancient religious sects, like the Bacchanalian sect,
[03:14:33.877 --> 03:14:47.580]  The Greeks who worshipped Dionysius and Bacchus because they felt that through wine or through imbibing alcohol they would immediately tap into some sort of mystical unity with the One.
[03:14:47.580 --> 03:14:55.562]  And he goes on to say that societies that give in to chemical dependency end up controlled.
[03:14:55.562 --> 03:15:00.903]  And he mentions the history of opium and the history of the British Empire's opium war, this kind of stuff.
[03:15:00.903 --> 03:15:03.184]  He goes into this in some detail.
[03:15:04.088 --> 03:15:10.212]  And you begin to see that this is not just an essay about mystical experience and liberation through drug experience.
[03:15:10.212 --> 03:15:18.256]  It's actually an essay on the sociological control mechanism behind drugs.
[03:15:18.256 --> 03:15:21.558]  And that the power structure has known this for a long time.
[03:15:21.558 --> 03:15:23.179]  And you remember last week I talked about
[03:15:24.014 --> 03:15:24.334]  I think so.
[03:15:39.685 --> 03:15:54.016]  But I'm trying to explain to you that this just comes out of the older British model of imperial warfare, not just through guns and bombs and whatnot, but also through cultural warfare, through drug warfare.
[03:15:54.016 --> 03:15:54.596]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:15:54.596 --> 03:15:55.377]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:15:55.377 --> 03:15:56.378]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer.
[03:15:56.803 --> 03:16:09.329]  Every time I talk to you, you're either like on the border exposing the cartels and like coming under fire or you're on the streets of some American city hanging out with drug addicts and criminals and now you've gone to ground zero of a massive chemical spill.
[03:16:09.329 --> 03:16:11.090]  Are you addicted to the danger, Savannah?
[03:16:11.090 --> 03:16:12.851]  Have you ever considered that for a second?
[03:16:13.271 --> 03:16:16.073]  No, I'm addicted to helping my fellow Americans.
[03:16:16.073 --> 03:16:17.794]  I'm addicted to spreading the truth.
[03:16:17.794 --> 03:16:20.295]  And again, you know, I have InfoWars to thank for that.
[03:16:20.295 --> 03:16:30.461]  Looking back on the day I was able to ask President Donald Trump two questions, I was so grateful because, you know, I truly was classically trained under Alex Jones and under the InfoWars team.
[03:16:30.461 --> 03:16:35.364]  I really do credit that as to why I'm able to, you know, get these types of clips.
[03:16:35.364 --> 03:16:38.506]  Because Alex's whole mentality was, you know, go where the
[03:16:39.067 --> 03:16:47.660]  I'm just addicted to telling the truth and helping the American people.
[03:16:47.660 --> 03:16:52.027]  And I really do credit Alex for, you know, really instilling that within me early on in my career.
[03:16:56.897 --> 03:17:02.899]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move against Tucker Carlson and take him off the air.
[03:17:02.899 --> 03:17:05.539]  People said, no way, he's the most powerful thing that ever happened.
[03:17:05.539 --> 03:17:07.720]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[03:17:07.720 --> 03:17:10.321]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him.
[03:17:10.321 --> 03:17:13.542]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[03:17:13.542 --> 03:17:15.302]  It's the same thing with Infowars.
[03:17:15.302 --> 03:17:21.924]  But Infowars is not owned by Fox, or controlled by George Soros, or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[03:17:21.924 --> 03:17:24.725]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[03:17:25.700 --> 03:17:27.801]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[03:17:27.801 --> 03:17:32.445]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[03:17:32.445 --> 03:17:36.167]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[03:17:36.167 --> 03:17:39.289]  So I want to thank you for your support and encourage viewers and listeners to understand.
[03:17:39.289 --> 03:17:41.851]  Please don't take InfoWars for granted.
[03:17:41.851 --> 03:17:43.212]  We're barely hanging on.
[03:17:43.212 --> 03:17:48.976]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support, while getting great products at the same time at InfoWarsRaw.com.
[03:17:48.976 --> 03:17:50.356]  So don't procrastinate.
[03:17:50.356 --> 03:17:51.677]  Go to InfoWarsRaw.com.
[03:17:51.677 --> 03:17:55.600]  Get amazing products that keep us on the air and never submit to these tyrants.
[03:17:55.640 --> 03:17:55.851]  Watch!
[03:18:04.924 --> 03:18:13.628]  You need to get coordinated with not only your food, but also your health supplements, because it's going to be a matter of life and death.
[03:18:13.628 --> 03:18:15.808]  So support InfoWarsTore.
[03:18:15.808 --> 03:18:24.292]  Listen, you need to put it as a priority, because you don't know, I don't know, Alex and I are telling you how late it is before midnight strikes.
[03:18:24.292 --> 03:18:28.954]  And again, magnesium is critical for your muscles and everything.
[03:18:28.954 --> 03:18:29.494]  Krill oil,
[03:18:29.834 --> 03:18:37.641]  What I'm watching right before my eyes is a composite overview of nutritional supplements that will keep you alive.
[03:18:37.641 --> 03:18:43.646]  And I would urge everyone, maybe you don't take vitamins, maybe you don't take nutritional supplements, but the day will come.
[03:18:43.646 --> 03:18:46.388]  Vitamin C and Zinc, absolutely imperative for the cold.
[03:18:46.388 --> 03:18:48.570]  DNA force, absolutely imperative.
[03:18:48.570 --> 03:18:50.491]  Mineral fusion, absolutely.
[03:18:50.491 --> 03:18:53.834]  As you're drinking filtered water, a lot of it will become demineralized.
[03:18:53.834 --> 03:18:55.855]  You have to have these products.
[03:18:56.656 --> 03:19:03.321]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mug shot because they knew that that would help Trump.
[03:19:03.321 --> 03:19:05.262]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[03:19:05.262 --> 03:19:06.763]  We were waiting for the mug shot.
[03:19:06.763 --> 03:19:09.625]  We learned today they wouldn't have it, so we've made our own.
[03:19:09.625 --> 03:19:11.567]  And it says political prisoner.
[03:19:12.347 --> 03:19:14.329]  With an image of President Trump.
[03:19:14.329 --> 03:19:16.771]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[03:19:16.771 --> 03:19:18.913]  It'll be shipping out to you in one week.
[03:19:18.913 --> 03:19:24.278]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front there in a mug shot.
[03:19:24.278 --> 03:19:25.499]  Jail background.
[03:19:25.499 --> 03:19:26.540]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[03:19:26.540 --> 03:19:30.684]  It says InfoWars.com on the back of the shirt.
[03:19:30.684 --> 03:19:32.285]  We also have Alex Jones for President.
[03:19:32.285 --> 03:19:33.306]  No, I'm not running for President.
[03:19:33.306 --> 03:19:35.868]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt.
[03:19:35.868 --> 03:19:36.629]  Red, white, and blue.
[03:19:36.629 --> 03:19:37.510]  Alex Jones for President.
[03:19:37.870 --> 03:19:41.051]  Win 24, it's a fun conversational piece and a limited edition shirt.
[03:19:41.051 --> 03:19:42.912]  Great way to fund the operation.
[03:19:42.912 --> 03:19:58.436]  So get your Alex Jones for President and Trump mugshot shirts at InfoWarsTore.com or by calling toll free AAA 253-3139.
[03:19:58.436 --> 03:20:03.058]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:20:03.058 --> 03:20:04.338]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:20:12.662 --> 03:20:13.603]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:13.603 --> 03:20:14.683]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer.
[03:20:14.683 --> 03:20:23.588]  Today's analysis, we're talking about the control of society through cultural warfare, which doesn't begin with the 1960s or even the 50s.
[03:20:23.588 --> 03:20:27.310]  It goes back to the drug war.
[03:20:27.310 --> 03:20:31.452]  And I don't mean the drug war of the Reagan era and the DARE program.
[03:20:31.452 --> 03:20:34.714]  I'm talking about the British Empire and their strategy of
[03:20:35.948 --> 03:20:42.954]  Making a lot of money and exercising a lot of cultural influence and control through the sale of opium.
[03:20:42.954 --> 03:21:01.811]  And when we look at the history of pharmacology, we see that, again, I'm emphasizing this because I want you to understand that the idea of culture warfare, which is a huge part of what we're experiencing today, what we're undergoing,
[03:21:03.073 --> 03:21:04.994]  You can see that this is old.
[03:21:04.994 --> 03:21:05.894]  It's not new.
[03:21:05.894 --> 03:21:10.517]  A lot of people are still, they can't understand the idea that culture is created and steered.
[03:21:10.517 --> 03:21:12.498]  They think that it's just a purely organic thing.
[03:21:12.498 --> 03:21:21.362]  And I'm trying to explain to you that if you can understand that through the history of drug warfare, that that's a huge part of culture war.
[03:21:21.362 --> 03:21:24.443]  You can begin to see that our society is really controlled.
[03:21:24.443 --> 03:21:29.265]  Our society is a top-down dystopia that kind of already exists.
[03:21:31.132 --> 03:21:39.316]  In Huxley's scenario, he's describing the future religion, the future society, in an essay that's not part of Brave New World.
[03:21:39.316 --> 03:21:46.159]  And he's not saying that this is going to be some top-down thing, but it will be introduced.
[03:21:46.159 --> 03:21:48.380]  That's where it starts getting wilder and wilder in this essay.
[03:21:48.380 --> 03:21:59.245]  It says that there will be future drug laws against certain drugs, but there will be the proliferation of other drugs precisely for social control.
[03:22:00.552 --> 03:22:06.414]  And he even goes on to say that psychiatry is engaged right now.
[03:22:06.414 --> 03:22:26.703]  He's writing this back in the 50s, I think, when he wrote this essay, in perfecting pharmacological means for creating new drugs and new synthetic ways of escapism, so that eventually there can be the release of this on society.
[03:22:28.206 --> 03:22:45.092]  To the extent that chemical restraint will enable the dictatorships of tomorrow to actually deprive men of their freedom who will willingly give it away in exchange for a chemical synthetic form of happiness.
[03:22:45.092 --> 03:22:55.595]  All of this, he says, will be chemically induced and thus man's achievements may turn out to be incompatible in terms of liberty and freedom and economics.
[03:22:55.595 --> 03:22:56.936]  None of that will compare to
[03:22:58.351 --> 03:23:03.692]  The pleasures that he will get from future drugs and future synthetic control mechanisms.
[03:23:03.692 --> 03:23:07.293]  And what I'm getting at here is that he's not talking about street drugs.
[03:23:07.293 --> 03:23:16.635]  I mean, obviously there are street drugs, but in my view, yes, fentanyl and all that is totally a ridiculous, absurd crisis that's engineered and so forth.
[03:23:16.635 --> 03:23:18.995]  But I'm talking about Big Pharma.
[03:23:18.995 --> 03:23:20.135]  That's the real drug dealers.
[03:23:20.135 --> 03:23:23.276]  And they're at the top of the pyramid.
[03:23:23.276 --> 03:23:27.937]  And the big pharmaceutical companies who were intently involved in the last three years
[03:23:28.846 --> 03:23:37.950]  Billions of dollars of profit and controlling a society on an unbelievable scale in the last three years of nonsense.
[03:23:37.950 --> 03:23:39.330]  That's what he's talking about.
[03:23:39.330 --> 03:23:47.374]  He's saying that you're going to be under a medical pharmaceutical dictatorship of the future.
[03:23:47.374 --> 03:23:50.195]  Not a jackboot dictatorship.
[03:23:50.195 --> 03:23:53.296]  Now, I mean, in some places it turned out to be that, like Australia.
[03:23:53.296 --> 03:23:56.158]  But who was really calling the shots?
[03:23:56.158 --> 03:23:57.158]  It wasn't really Fauci.
[03:23:57.987 --> 03:24:02.409]  It was the international oligarchic elite that run these corporations.
[03:24:02.409 --> 03:24:04.650]  That's who's calling the shots.
[03:24:04.650 --> 03:24:10.734]  And that is who was really in the background of MKUltra and all of this widespread research.
[03:24:10.734 --> 03:24:15.856]  Yes, there's government elements to it, but it's flip sides of the same coin, right?
[03:24:15.856 --> 03:24:25.881]  The big pharmaceutical companies, the big corporations, they're in a revolving door scenario with the people who go to the CDC, who go to the, you know, all the government agencies.
[03:24:25.881 --> 03:24:26.982]  They're the same people.
[03:24:28.368 --> 03:24:35.013]  And so it might as well be a government owned by these people.
[03:24:35.013 --> 03:24:42.039]  And so these people, these pharmaceutical companies, these are the ones that were studying MKUltra.
[03:24:42.039 --> 03:24:47.183]  Yes, again, there was army military research, but that's not who's really calling the shots.
[03:24:47.183 --> 03:24:49.705]  It's these companies.
[03:24:49.705 --> 03:24:54.829]  And they were the ones studying intently the effects of peyote, the effects of LSD.
[03:24:56.306 --> 03:25:00.248]  And all of its derivatives back in the 1950s and 60s.
[03:25:00.248 --> 03:25:03.350]  And they weren't studying it because they were interested in human liberation.
[03:25:03.350 --> 03:25:11.415]  They were studying it because they wanted, yes, to synthesize it, have synthetic versions of all these things for human control, sure.
[03:25:11.415 --> 03:25:13.916]  But it's ultimately about social control.
[03:25:13.916 --> 03:25:21.461]  In culture, it was not about primarily creating super soldiers.
[03:25:22.915 --> 03:25:24.175]  Not about assassins.
[03:25:24.175 --> 03:25:31.018]  It's about social control on a mass scale.
[03:25:31.018 --> 03:25:35.079]  And a big part of that is not just the drug culture.
[03:25:35.079 --> 03:25:37.380]  It's the toxic pop culture.
[03:25:37.380 --> 03:25:43.162]  Those two things go together because they come out of the same labs, so to speak.
[03:25:43.162 --> 03:25:47.864]  He goes on to mention that in his day, it was being intently studied.
[03:25:48.789 --> 03:25:59.052]  The ascetic practices of various mystics of different religions, fakirs of India, and their bodily punishments and whatnot that would lead to altered states of consciousness.
[03:25:59.052 --> 03:26:03.413]  He mentions John C. Lilly, the float tanks, all this kind of stuff.
[03:26:03.413 --> 03:26:16.836]  He says that ultimately all of this is being combined into a future offering that will be given to the population, to the public, to control them
[03:26:18.251 --> 03:26:19.492]  And make them happy.
[03:26:19.492 --> 03:26:22.594]  He says, all of these things will soon be on the market.
[03:26:22.594 --> 03:26:24.535]  How did he know that?
[03:26:24.535 --> 03:26:31.039]  How did he know that all of these high-level drugs would soon be on the market?
[03:26:31.039 --> 03:26:35.541]  And in my view, this is a big part of why so many people in society are going nuts.
[03:26:35.541 --> 03:26:44.547]  There's the toxic culture, the brainwashing in the schools, the terrible food and diet, the stabbies, but there's also
[03:26:45.492 --> 03:26:50.736]  Countless people on countless pharmaceutical drugs.
[03:26:50.736 --> 03:26:53.358]  Bombing their minds on a daily basis.
[03:26:53.358 --> 03:26:54.760]  And they have been for decades.
[03:26:54.760 --> 03:27:04.628]  Because if you remember back in the 90s, when they really started pushing, for example, the SSRIs, the pharmaceutical answers to you having a bad day.
[03:27:04.628 --> 03:27:05.568]  Oh, it's unnatural.
[03:27:05.568 --> 03:27:06.169]  It's abnormal.
[03:27:06.169 --> 03:27:11.053]  You've been diagnosed with a genetic predisposition to depression.
[03:27:11.053 --> 03:27:12.474]  And so it's a chemical imbalance.
[03:27:13.502 --> 03:27:21.286]  All based around the idea that just throwing chemicals at a problem solves the problem, because man, it's just chemical reactions anyway, right?
[03:27:21.286 --> 03:27:28.409]  But ironically, Huxley's basically saying that you understand what's been rolled out as a control mechanism.
[03:27:28.409 --> 03:27:31.731]  And we just watched Apocalypto the other day.
[03:27:31.731 --> 03:27:34.252]  Remember the Mel Gibson movie?
[03:27:34.252 --> 03:27:35.273]  Great movie.
[03:27:35.273 --> 03:27:41.256]  And, you know, when you get to the last, you know, the third of the movie, the
[03:27:42.557 --> 03:27:55.086]  Climax of the film, when they get to the temples there, the ziggurats, the Mayan Empire, you'll notice that the society is based around even this drug experience.
[03:27:55.086 --> 03:28:00.930]  It's not really highlighted in the movie, but they were really into those hallucinogenic drugs, you know, in the Mayan Inc.
[03:28:00.930 --> 03:28:03.432]  and all those kinds of Latin South America, Central America.
[03:28:04.412 --> 03:28:28.640]  Civilizations and in my view that's that's kind of how they thought they were tapping into These other worlds and the shaman and the high priest and these people and they were being told all we have to require human sacrifice I'm not saying that everybody that does hallucinogens is going to require human sacrifice or be initiated into a Mayan cult I'm just saying that that's a feature of that religion and those religions and those cultures and
[03:28:29.068 --> 03:28:34.590]  And they did start requiring and asking for human sacrifice on a mass scale as part of social control.
[03:28:34.590 --> 03:28:39.512]  They weren't just mad people out of their minds, they were, but they were also very interested in social control.
[03:28:39.512 --> 03:28:42.154]  And in that movie, they know that the eclipse is coming.
[03:28:42.154 --> 03:28:48.096]  And so they duped the population who doesn't know calendars and dates, and they don't know that it's an eclipse.
[03:28:48.096 --> 03:28:52.538]  And so they've fooled the population into thinking that they can kill and resurrect the sun, right?
[03:28:52.538 --> 03:28:53.638]  The high priest and the emperor.
[03:28:53.638 --> 03:28:55.099]  Don't go anywhere, this is the Alex Jones Show!
[03:28:57.737 --> 03:29:00.883]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[03:29:00.883 --> 03:29:03.187]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[03:29:03.187 --> 03:29:06.232]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[03:29:06.232 --> 03:29:11.060]  But when we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers...
[03:29:12.492 --> 03:29:16.036]  They really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[03:29:16.036 --> 03:29:24.865]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[03:29:24.865 --> 03:29:28.509]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[03:29:28.509 --> 03:29:33.474]  And I want to encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[03:29:34.275 --> 03:29:35.235]  I know you spread the word.
[03:29:35.235 --> 03:29:36.756]  I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful.
[03:29:36.756 --> 03:29:37.316]  Keep doing it.
[03:29:37.316 --> 03:29:46.238]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsTore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, all at the same time keeping us on air.
[03:29:46.238 --> 03:29:50.560]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:29:50.560 --> 03:29:55.501]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsTore.com, our funding problems will be over.
[03:29:55.501 --> 03:29:56.281]  Please take action now.
[03:29:58.840 --> 03:30:09.263]  I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to mfulworthstore.com and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that empower your immune system and your body, and keep us on air.
[03:30:09.263 --> 03:30:17.605]  I am humbly, hand-in-hand, talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in, many of you for years, and never gone to mfulworthstore.com.
[03:30:17.605 --> 03:30:26.088]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you never actually go to mfulworthstore.com and never experience these great products and never find the operation.
[03:30:26.388 --> 03:30:29.449]  Sure, you share a link, you share an article, you tell folks about the show.
[03:30:29.449 --> 03:30:30.810]  That's great, and I thank you.
[03:30:30.810 --> 03:30:32.351]  But we need funds to operate.
[03:30:32.351 --> 03:30:40.695]  Plus, we've got really great products that do amazing things for people, like our CBD oil, and our Fizzy Magnesium, and our Sleep Aid, and our Nitric Oxide, and our Real Red Pill.
[03:30:40.695 --> 03:30:43.656]  Plus, all of these are really great products that keep us on air.
[03:30:43.656 --> 03:30:45.437]  Plus, you're missing out on having these products.
[03:30:45.437 --> 03:30:54.341]  So get off the bench, get in the game, step to the plate, and go to InfoWarsTore.com right now and get these great InfoWars products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:30:56.448 --> 03:30:59.987]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones!
[03:31:04.724 --> 03:31:06.065]  I want you all to know something.
[03:31:06.065 --> 03:31:08.027]  Alex Jones was right.
[03:31:08.027 --> 03:31:11.569]  Alex is right about far more than he's wrong.
[03:31:11.569 --> 03:31:14.672]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[03:31:14.672 --> 03:31:18.935]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down.
[03:31:18.935 --> 03:31:21.157]  Alex Jones was right.
[03:31:21.157 --> 03:31:24.679]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[03:31:24.679 --> 03:31:28.122]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[03:31:28.402 --> 03:31:31.263]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[03:31:31.263 --> 03:31:32.304]  Years ago.
[03:31:32.304 --> 03:31:36.366]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[03:31:36.366 --> 03:31:38.887]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[03:31:38.887 --> 03:31:41.348]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[03:31:41.348 --> 03:31:44.470]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[03:31:44.470 --> 03:31:49.112]  That's why the globalists hate me, is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[03:31:56.533 --> 03:32:02.834]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution is laying right there in front of you, hidden in plain view.
[03:32:02.834 --> 03:32:05.795]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[03:32:05.795 --> 03:32:15.337]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website where they admit the number one cause of cognitive disability in the world is iodine deficiency.
[03:32:15.337 --> 03:32:17.298]  The number one preventable cause
[03:32:18.018 --> 03:32:28.927]  of intellectual disability is lack of real pure iodine in the body as they bomb us with the bad halogens bromine, bromide, chlorine and so much more.
[03:32:28.927 --> 03:32:38.855]  Upwards of two billion people in a Lancet medical journal study in 2007 worldwide have cognitive disabilities because they don't have high quality iodine.
[03:32:38.855 --> 03:32:41.237]  Most iodine is bound to other elements you don't absorb it.
[03:32:41.237 --> 03:32:44.299]  We have X3 all three types of good iodine together
[03:32:45.020 --> 03:32:45.620]  Let's do it!
[03:33:12.708 --> 03:33:13.669]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:33:13.669 --> 03:33:15.691]  I'm your guest, that's Jay and I are Jay Zanossis.
[03:33:15.691 --> 03:33:21.916]  We are going through the plans and the machinations of the oligarchs and their discussions.
[03:33:21.916 --> 03:33:22.937]  Very open, by the way.
[03:33:22.937 --> 03:33:30.864]  Hidden in plain sight of what they plan to do with a lot of the technological means as well as the drug means.
[03:33:31.423 --> 03:33:35.265]  of controlling society and erecting the brave new world scenario.
[03:33:35.265 --> 03:33:42.509]  And I found this sort of obscure essay from Huxley covering how drugs affect men's minds.
[03:33:42.509 --> 03:33:46.711]  And he ends this essay by talking about a future world religion.
[03:33:46.711 --> 03:33:58.377]  And it just made me think about what I'd watched in Apocalypto, the excellent Mel Gibson film, where you had the high priest and the emperor there engage in the human sacrifice.
[03:33:59.057 --> 03:34:08.861]  That they had duped all the people because they knew about the calendar and the eclipse that was coming and the people thought, oh, well, I guess he was able to resurrect the sun.
[03:34:08.861 --> 03:34:26.849]  And I was pointing out that when Gordon Lawson and these different figures who were actually bankers went and studied the cultures in Latin South America, Central America to understand the mushroom, to understand the ergot and all that, to synthesize and create LSD, which is what eventually happened.
[03:34:27.537 --> 03:34:30.599]  You know, that actually came from a banker.
[03:34:30.599 --> 03:34:33.421]  He was part of the Macy Foundation.
[03:34:33.421 --> 03:34:36.263]  This figure, Gordon Wasson, and his wife.
[03:34:36.263 --> 03:34:42.427]  And they figured out how to synthesize LSD, and it was later Sandoz Pharmaceuticals, and, you know, the CIA and all that.
[03:34:42.427 --> 03:34:52.134]  They were definitely involved in this, but you begin to see the interlinking of, you know, these organizations, government entities, as well as these giant pharmaceutical companies.
[03:34:52.134 --> 03:34:54.376]  And Huxley says that, you know,
[03:34:55.840 --> 03:35:10.673]  One of the reasons that these societies were studied was the amazing amount of control that could be had when you take something like the drug trip and you turn it into a social control mechanism, right?
[03:35:10.673 --> 03:35:12.394]  And that's what he's describing in this essay.
[03:35:12.394 --> 03:35:16.338]  He's saying that we will even get the churches on board.
[03:35:16.338 --> 03:35:17.359]  Now, this didn't really happen.
[03:35:17.359 --> 03:35:20.041]  The churches didn't really hop on board with psychedelics.
[03:35:20.041 --> 03:35:21.282]  Maybe some churches did, but
[03:35:22.225 --> 03:35:24.846]  He says that maybe we could try to get the churches involved in this.
[03:35:24.846 --> 03:35:32.027]  And he says, and if the churches don't go along with the counterculture that's coming, by the way, how do you know that the drug counterculture was coming?
[03:35:32.027 --> 03:35:40.449]  How did he know in the 50s that the 60s counterculture revolution was coming if it wasn't, if it was an organic revolution?
[03:35:40.449 --> 03:35:41.189]  It wasn't organic.
[03:35:41.189 --> 03:35:47.211]  It was steered by Esalen Institute, by these foundations, by the pharmaceutical companies.
[03:35:47.211 --> 03:35:49.952]  Changing images of men.
[03:35:49.952 --> 03:35:51.672]  White papers written about using
[03:35:52.651 --> 03:35:56.353]  Counterculture, using alternative lifestyles to steer society.
[03:35:56.353 --> 03:35:59.896]  That is why all of this is out in the public now.
[03:35:59.896 --> 03:36:03.118]  All of the TRANS agenda.
[03:36:03.118 --> 03:36:05.659]  All of the VEGA agenda.
[03:36:05.659 --> 03:36:08.161]  Do you understand this all comes out of think tanks?
[03:36:08.161 --> 03:36:14.685]  It's not just random liberals organically deciding to come up with stuff.
[03:36:14.685 --> 03:36:16.567]  It's not just random professors.
[03:36:16.567 --> 03:36:18.748]  All of this comes out of Tavistock,
[03:36:19.724 --> 03:36:25.848]  Think Tanks, RAND, MIT, they come up with this and they push it in society.
[03:36:25.848 --> 03:36:28.249]  Just like they pushed the last three years of stuff.
[03:36:28.249 --> 03:36:31.211]  It was a war game for decades.
[03:36:31.211 --> 03:36:35.234]  With all these different event scenarios.
[03:36:35.234 --> 03:36:41.138]  Blade X, 201, Crimson Contagion, on and on and on.
[03:36:41.138 --> 03:36:42.379]  Lockstep.
[03:36:42.379 --> 03:36:49.163]  Well, in the same way, the same countless Think Tanks, NGOs, foundations, war game and rollout
[03:36:50.351 --> 03:36:57.533]  New religions, new ideological movements, new scenarios to steer society.
[03:36:57.533 --> 03:37:01.174]  And the 60s counterculture was crucial for where we are now.
[03:37:01.174 --> 03:37:07.716]  Do you think you could have the rainbow revolution and the trans revolution without the 60s counterculture?
[03:37:07.716 --> 03:37:09.077]  No, of course not.
[03:37:09.077 --> 03:37:11.518]  So, but it comes in phases.
[03:37:11.518 --> 03:37:15.659]  And it's just the latest instantiation of revolution.
[03:37:16.854 --> 03:37:25.441]  And that's, by the way, one of the elements that Huxley got right that George Orwell did not get right, which is the intense sexual element of the dystopia.
[03:37:25.441 --> 03:37:32.347]  The clown world dystopia is a rainbow dystopia.
[03:37:32.347 --> 03:37:40.554]  It's not just a dystopia of a Stalin-esque, you know, top-down dictatorship.
[03:37:40.554 --> 03:37:44.257]  It's the pleasure-based model of pharmacological
[03:37:46.524 --> 03:37:57.374]  And so Huxley says that if we don't get this world religion, it's eventually going to emerge on its own.
[03:37:57.374 --> 03:38:08.364]  It will be a new world religion that emerges out of the spiritual experience of the beyond through people taking drugs and rejecting institutional churches and religions.
[03:38:08.364 --> 03:38:09.365]  And of course, the
[03:38:10.330 --> 03:38:13.811]  Oligarchs have captured most of the institutional churches anyway.
[03:38:13.811 --> 03:38:15.872]  So they're captured institutions.
[03:38:15.872 --> 03:38:18.732]  So you can see how they sort of game it both ways.
[03:38:18.732 --> 03:38:34.577]  Well, if the religious institutions are captured and they're turned into essentially just liberal NGOs and forms of soft power, that's what most of the churches are, then now people will turn to alternative religions and alternative religious experience and those are also promoted by the exact same oligarchs.
[03:38:34.577 --> 03:38:37.618]  That's what Leary is saying in these essays.
[03:38:37.618 --> 03:38:38.398]  And again, he says that
[03:38:39.002 --> 03:38:40.022]  This will come.
[03:38:40.022 --> 03:38:41.263]  You will have this rolled out.
[03:38:41.263 --> 03:38:43.564]  How does he know?
[03:38:43.564 --> 03:38:44.444]  Is he a prophet?
[03:38:44.444 --> 03:38:44.904]  No.
[03:38:44.904 --> 03:38:52.967]  He's part of this inner structure, part of these people who know what they're rolling out, and they talk about worshipping and serving Lucifer.
[03:38:52.967 --> 03:38:55.628]  Now, some of them think that's a symbolic thing.
[03:38:55.628 --> 03:38:58.129]  They don't think that there's some real spirit.
[03:38:58.129 --> 03:39:05.311]  They just see it as a Promethean symbol to emulate, to be like the rebel angel.
[03:39:05.311 --> 03:39:06.572]  They see it as something to
[03:39:07.173 --> 03:39:13.559]  Model yourself as a kind of rattle against even nature itself, right?
[03:39:13.559 --> 03:39:20.404]  To transcend humanity, transcending the limitations of nature and the created order.
[03:39:20.404 --> 03:39:30.533]  And so we get people like Dr. John C. Lilly, who begins to have fixations for dolphins, and he gives them LSD and puts brain chips in the dolphins.
[03:39:30.533 --> 03:39:32.755]  I mean, just mad science people, okay?
[03:39:34.301 --> 03:39:40.043]  But they also typically talk about interacting with the entities on the other side.
[03:39:40.043 --> 03:39:50.168]  Both Huxley and John C. Lilly talk about, on their intense drug trips, getting information and getting interaction with entities.
[03:39:50.168 --> 03:39:58.811]  The clockwork elves of Terrence McKenna talking to beings, having conferences with these entities.
[03:39:58.811 --> 03:40:02.252]  You've watched the movie Altered States with William Hurt, right?
[03:40:02.252 --> 03:40:03.313]  Exactly what's in that film.
[03:40:05.319 --> 03:40:11.743]  And so you have these figures continuing on this research from the time of Huxley on until now and even still to this day.
[03:40:11.743 --> 03:40:22.989]  MIT, Berkeley, various universities doing the same types of research with very powerful hallucinogenic drugs to try to tap into the other side.
[03:40:22.989 --> 03:40:24.530]  But here's the question that's never asked.
[03:40:25.979 --> 03:40:28.821]  How do we know that the entities are good entities?
[03:40:28.821 --> 03:40:31.563]  It's just the assumption is that, well, it's a spiritual experience.
[03:40:31.563 --> 03:40:32.303]  It must be good.
[03:40:32.303 --> 03:40:35.546]  Well, maybe they're lying, deceptive spiritual experiences.
[03:40:35.546 --> 03:40:41.069]  Maybe the entities that are telling you to have a world government and to kill everybody, maybe they're bad guys.
[03:40:41.069 --> 03:40:42.110]  Have you ever think about that?
[03:40:42.110 --> 03:40:43.831]  Maybe they're demons.
[03:40:43.831 --> 03:40:44.572]  Oh, that's crazy.
[03:40:44.572 --> 03:40:46.193]  You're a fundamentalist.
[03:40:46.193 --> 03:40:49.995]  Wait, I mean, you're sitting here telling me that entities are telling you to kill everybody.
[03:40:49.995 --> 03:40:51.056]  Sounds like a demon to me.
[03:40:51.056 --> 03:40:55.119]  I mean, why do they always have the same message?
[03:40:55.868 --> 03:41:01.813]  They always say, erect a world government, cut down the population.
[03:41:01.813 --> 03:41:03.735]  That's exactly what all these people say.
[03:41:03.735 --> 03:41:07.458]  So maybe these people are inspired by a malevolent force.
[03:41:07.458 --> 03:41:10.641]  Well, how come nobody considers that option?
[03:41:10.641 --> 03:41:17.687]  Seems pretty no-brainer to me, but I guess if you don't have any discernment, you wouldn't be able to see that.
[03:41:17.687 --> 03:41:19.989]  Your discernment is gone.
[03:41:19.989 --> 03:41:20.309]  Lost.
[03:41:24.110 --> 03:41:35.254]  In fact, in McKenna's books, for example, who's continuing on this tradition in his Food of the Gods, he says, I'm continuing the work of Timothy Leary and all of these people, and I want to bring a shamanic initiation.
[03:41:35.254 --> 03:41:41.477]  That's exactly what Leary talks about at the end of his essay, Drugs and the Mind.
[03:41:41.477 --> 03:41:49.260]  He says that we're bringing about a shamanic initiation for the masses.
[03:41:49.260 --> 03:41:51.441]  But I don't think he's interested in a real
[03:41:52.233 --> 03:41:55.595]  flourishing of human experience and freedom.
[03:41:55.595 --> 03:42:00.799]  He's actually talking about fitting into the Brave New World scenario.
[03:42:00.799 --> 03:42:16.911]  And it's nothing new because the same oligarchs running this now are the same oligarchs 100 years ago, 150 years ago, that were running drug lanes as described by Professor Anthony Sutton in his classic book, America's Secret Establishment, Order of Skull and Bones.
[03:42:16.911 --> 03:42:20.533]  The origin of the OSS and the CIA comes out of what?
[03:42:20.533 --> 03:42:21.054]  Skull and Bones.
[03:42:21.812 --> 03:42:23.013]  And what do these families do?
[03:42:23.013 --> 03:42:25.255]  How do they make their money?
[03:42:25.255 --> 03:42:30.919]  Oh, well, they were just really hard-working individuals who were very moral and pulled themselves up by their bootstraps.
[03:42:30.919 --> 03:42:31.319]  No, no, no.
[03:42:31.319 --> 03:42:33.400]  They'd run drugs.
[03:42:33.400 --> 03:42:35.442]  Did you not know that?
[03:42:35.442 --> 03:42:41.046]  You thought they just started Walmart and did all these things because they're good business people and they're very moral?
[03:42:41.046 --> 03:42:42.887]  No.
[03:42:42.887 --> 03:42:45.229]  They're evil.
[03:42:45.229 --> 03:42:47.891]  And they take you to be dupes, you see.
[03:42:47.891 --> 03:42:49.152]  You, the middle class, are the dupes.
[03:42:50.430 --> 03:42:50.950]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:42:50.950 --> 03:42:51.790]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:42:51.790 --> 03:42:52.811]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer.
[03:42:52.811 --> 03:42:56.972]  Jay's Nelson.
[03:42:56.972 --> 03:42:59.573]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[03:42:59.573 --> 03:43:01.834]  Please write this down and please go look this up.
[03:43:01.834 --> 03:43:03.815]  It will change your life.
[03:43:03.815 --> 03:43:12.578]  The UN admits, and the Lansing Medical Journal admits, that upwards of two billion people have mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities.
[03:43:12.578 --> 03:43:17.899]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[03:43:17.899 --> 03:43:19.380]  Most iodine in the environment
[03:43:20.080 --> 03:43:23.624]  is bound to other elements so your body can't absorb it.
[03:43:23.624 --> 03:43:28.088]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[03:43:28.088 --> 03:43:35.175]  And InfoWarStore.com has the only iodine out there that actually has this type of full effect.
[03:43:35.175 --> 03:43:41.181]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3's been sold out for six months, it's very hard to produce, and it's finally back in stock.
[03:43:41.741 --> 03:43:44.103]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[03:43:44.103 --> 03:43:46.364]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is powerful.
[03:43:46.364 --> 03:43:48.165]  You and your family need it.
[03:43:48.165 --> 03:43:49.906]  It's 25% off back in stock.
[03:43:49.906 --> 03:43:54.129]  X3 Tri-Iodine, exclusively at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:43:54.129 --> 03:43:57.091]  Take action now, but regardless, research is info.
[03:43:57.091 --> 03:43:57.952]  InfoWars.
[03:43:57.952 --> 03:44:01.214]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[03:44:01.214 --> 03:44:02.975]  This is their big move.
[03:44:02.975 --> 03:44:06.757]  So, yeah, you say, why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States?
[03:44:06.757 --> 03:44:07.698]  He doesn't care.
[03:44:08.447 --> 03:44:09.709]  That's not his job.
[03:44:09.709 --> 03:44:11.452]  He's not the President of the United States.
[03:44:11.452 --> 03:44:15.318]  He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[03:44:15.318 --> 03:44:16.700]  Appetites of the autocrat!
[03:44:27.773 --> 03:44:28.653]  Exactly.
[03:44:28.653 --> 03:44:32.235]  And that's why we say no to your vaccines.
[03:44:32.235 --> 03:44:35.316]  We say no to you shutting down our businesses.
[03:44:35.316 --> 03:44:37.818]  We say no to you taking our firearms.
[03:44:37.818 --> 03:44:40.299]  We say no to you censoring our free speech.
[03:44:40.299 --> 03:44:43.921]  We say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization.
[03:44:43.921 --> 03:44:46.442]  We say no to you getting us into World War III.
[03:44:46.442 --> 03:44:46.842]  You're right!
[03:44:47.142 --> 03:44:51.899]  We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden, and we say no!
[03:44:51.899 --> 03:44:53.445]  And we say no to your war!
[03:44:56.812 --> 03:45:03.094]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution is laying right there in front of you, hidden in plain view.
[03:45:03.094 --> 03:45:06.075]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[03:45:06.075 --> 03:45:15.619]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website where they admit the number one cause of cognitive disability in the world is iodine deficiency.
[03:45:15.619 --> 03:45:17.560]  The number one preventable cause
[03:45:18.300 --> 03:45:29.185]  of intellectual disability is lack of real pure iodine in the body as they bomb us with the bad halogens bromine, bromide, chlorine and so much more.
[03:45:29.185 --> 03:45:39.130]  Upwards of two billion people in a Lancet Medical Journal study in 2007 worldwide have cognitive disabilities because they don't have high quality iodine.
[03:45:39.130 --> 03:45:41.491]  Most iodine is bound to other elements, you don't absorb it.
[03:45:41.491 --> 03:45:44.553]  We have X3, all three types of good iodine together
[03:45:45.253 --> 03:45:45.833]  We're good to go.
[03:46:11.929 --> 03:46:19.197]  The Alexa Pure Breeze, made by the My Patron Supply Ready Hour Group, that's been around about 15 years, became the biggest company in the last six.
[03:46:19.197 --> 03:46:26.765]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system out there that sells for twice the price, and they made it as good
[03:46:27.586 --> 03:46:31.967]  In all the studies, it reduces things to non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals.
[03:46:31.967 --> 03:46:33.488]  But you can go paint two or three times.
[03:46:33.488 --> 03:46:36.289]  There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[03:46:36.289 --> 03:46:41.510]  We sell the very best, highest-grade water filtration system for half the price of a leading competitor.
[03:46:41.510 --> 03:46:46.992]  And the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should filter your water.
[03:46:46.992 --> 03:46:48.633]  You should also filter your shower water.
[03:46:48.633 --> 03:46:50.213]  That's another way you absorb this crap.
[03:46:50.213 --> 03:46:51.753]  But I'm done talking about that.
[03:46:51.753 --> 03:46:54.334]  The point is, you can get the filters at mfulworthstore.com.
[03:46:54.334 --> 03:46:55.535]  They're discounted right now.
[03:46:55.535 --> 03:46:56.255]  Finally back in stock.
[03:46:57.529 --> 03:47:04.594]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:04.594 --> 03:47:12.660]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:12.660 --> 03:47:14.822]  I'm your guest host Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[03:47:14.822 --> 03:47:18.945]  We're talking about pharmacological means of control.
[03:47:18.945 --> 03:47:23.108]  And I want to remind you, if you head on over to my Twitter right now, just type in Jay Dyer on Twitter.
[03:47:23.803 --> 03:47:25.844]  And you'll see me, I'll pop up.
[03:47:25.844 --> 03:47:26.765]  There's live events.
[03:47:26.765 --> 03:47:28.786]  I want you to come to my live events.
[03:47:28.786 --> 03:47:33.069]  We'll be in Los Angeles, live July the 6th.
[03:47:33.069 --> 03:47:38.793]  And if you go to my Twitter, you'll see there up there at the top, there is the event right there.
[03:47:38.793 --> 03:47:39.774]  We'll be live with
[03:47:40.507 --> 03:47:41.807]  Some famous people.
[03:47:41.807 --> 03:47:43.048]  It's going to be a lot of fun.
[03:47:43.048 --> 03:47:46.589]  It's a five-hour event, so our events are not like most people's events.
[03:47:46.589 --> 03:47:54.411]  We did an event a few weeks ago, or actually a month or two ago, when I was in Austin down there with Alex, when we did a few in-studio interviews with Alex.
[03:47:54.411 --> 03:47:55.691]  I got a lot of traction.
[03:47:55.691 --> 03:47:56.231]  It was a lot of fun.
[03:47:56.231 --> 03:47:57.252]  We also did a live event.
[03:47:57.252 --> 03:48:00.212]  Yeah, there's my Tucker special, if you didn't see the Tucker special.
[03:48:00.212 --> 03:48:05.054]  That's actually in Austin, where I'm running around getting the Austinites to eat bugs there.
[03:48:07.512 --> 03:48:09.273]  So, hopefully I didn't get Tucker fired.
[03:48:09.273 --> 03:48:10.114]  I'm sorry if I did.
[03:48:10.114 --> 03:48:10.934]  My bad, guys.
[03:48:10.934 --> 03:48:11.375]  Oops.
[03:48:11.375 --> 03:48:12.055]  My bad.
[03:48:12.055 --> 03:48:14.177]  It might have been the clo- Klaus made a few phone calls.
[03:48:14.177 --> 03:48:15.718]  Get rid of the Tucker!
[03:48:15.718 --> 03:48:18.039]  This was the final straw!
[03:48:18.039 --> 03:48:19.000]  I want him gone!
[03:48:19.000 --> 03:48:25.945]  So, my, uh, my Klaus skit might have been the end of Tucker.
[03:48:25.945 --> 03:48:26.825]  Sorry about that.
[03:48:26.825 --> 03:48:27.786]  My bad, everybody.
[03:48:27.786 --> 03:48:27.906]  Um...
[03:48:28.777 --> 03:48:32.818]  Also live event, Nashville will be live in Nashville at a big event.
[03:48:32.818 --> 03:48:34.239]  Owen Schroyer, you might've heard of him.
[03:48:34.239 --> 03:48:35.199]  You guys heard of him?
[03:48:35.199 --> 03:48:36.439]  You know who he is?
[03:48:36.439 --> 03:48:38.100]  June 3rd and 4th.
[03:48:38.100 --> 03:48:43.741]  If you go to my Twitter, you'll also see that a few down, that is the Rebels for Cause event.
[03:48:43.741 --> 03:48:44.662]  So there's that event.
[03:48:44.662 --> 03:48:52.864]  And then there's also this event with Owen and a host of people over in Nashville.
[03:48:52.864 --> 03:48:55.585]  Mel K, Ryan Christain, Scott Armstrong.
[03:48:57.178 --> 03:48:59.119]  Matt Baker will be there.
[03:48:59.119 --> 03:49:00.320]  Tons and tons of people.
[03:49:00.320 --> 03:49:01.321]  A two-day event.
[03:49:01.321 --> 03:49:07.304]  So go get your tickets to that Rebels for Cause event outside Nashville, June 3rd and 4th.
[03:49:07.304 --> 03:49:08.384]  So get those tickets.
[03:49:08.384 --> 03:49:09.265]  It's going to be a lot of fun.
[03:49:09.265 --> 03:49:11.926]  Yeah, that's it.
[03:49:11.926 --> 03:49:13.127]  Should be a big, big event.
[03:49:13.127 --> 03:49:18.630]  Again, Owen will be there, as well as a bunch of other really cool Bay's Red Pill people.
[03:49:18.630 --> 03:49:23.973]  So we're talking about the drug lanes, drug networks, America's secret establishment.
[03:49:23.973 --> 03:49:25.434]  This classic text from
[03:49:26.716 --> 03:49:30.219]  Professor Anthony Sutton, and we've been covering a lot of Anthony Sutton books lately.
[03:49:30.219 --> 03:49:34.643]  I stumbled upon one that I didn't know about, which he wrote with Patrick Wood.
[03:49:34.643 --> 03:49:41.069]  I know Alex has had Patrick Wood on many times, but this is actually written in the 70s, and so I'm really enjoying this text.
[03:49:41.069 --> 03:49:51.238]  And it relates to all this, too, because we start to see that it's really the same power structure that's kind of been there, this oligarchy that's been there for a long time, particularly the last hundred years or so in America, right?
[03:49:51.238 --> 03:49:53.120]  The American oligarchical power structure.
[03:49:53.666 --> 03:49:58.927]  Which is the same power structure described by a lot of the elite techs, Dr. Carol Quigley and others.
[03:49:58.927 --> 03:50:07.469]  And I want to remind you guys, too, that I've lectured through 60-ish of these texts, and I've got more.
[03:50:07.469 --> 03:50:08.529]  I got more in the mail.
[03:50:08.529 --> 03:50:09.469]  Good news.
[03:50:09.469 --> 03:50:11.789]  Just got this classic.
[03:50:11.789 --> 03:50:17.670]  So years before Edward Bernays wrote propaganda, Walter Lippmann wrote public opinion.
[03:50:17.670 --> 03:50:19.631]  So we'll be covering this one in the next few weeks.
[03:50:19.631 --> 03:50:20.471]  It's going to be a lot of fun.
[03:50:22.188 --> 03:50:33.291]  And I've enjoyed reading all these other Huxley books, Huxter books, Aldous Huxter books, Aldous Huxley that I'd never read before, because there's a lot of insights.
[03:50:33.291 --> 03:50:47.654]  Everybody knows about kind of the famous books of Orwell or Huxley, but turns out that a lot of times they have these other lesser-known books and essays and writings that give you a lot of nuggets, a lot of gems, a lot of insights into what else they were up to and what was really going on.
[03:50:47.654 --> 03:50:49.235]  And I was mentioning, you know, covering
[03:50:50.439 --> 03:50:54.563]  John C. Lilly's books, covering Terrence McKenna's books, the Psychonauts.
[03:50:54.563 --> 03:51:07.734]  The Psychonauts are really important because, although they weren't necessarily running the whole New World Order, they were really the visionaries that were playing out and planning out and experimenting with future means of control.
[03:51:07.734 --> 03:51:13.619]  And one of those visionaries, far prior to Huxley or Andy's killer, Andy's killer, Wells, as we said, and H.G.
[03:51:13.619 --> 03:51:16.761]  Wells, was talking about the future world religion in the 1890s.
[03:51:18.402 --> 03:51:28.765]  He wrote a book, God the Invisible King, where he said that the future world religion will be a New Age, kind of, Luciferian religion.
[03:51:28.765 --> 03:51:41.488]  And, in my view, the British Imperial superstructure, that inner core, the shadow government of the British Empire, the Milner-Fabian circles, they were actually running and controlling the Theosophy Society.
[03:51:41.488 --> 03:51:46.970]  And so, Theosophy, with its promotion of Bolshevism, its promotion of Soviet
[03:51:48.727 --> 03:51:52.589]  That was being foisted by the Milner-Fabian Society.
[03:51:52.589 --> 03:52:10.680]  And I think that Madame Blavatsky, one of these predecessors to the New Age, almost 70, 80 years before the New Age movement actually becomes a full-on thing in the 1960s, this was being planned out by the Fabian Socialists and the Tavistock Institute.
[03:52:10.680 --> 03:52:13.842]  And so, again, we've covered this book, this 500-page classic.
[03:52:14.415 --> 03:52:18.897]  Text on the history of that conspiracy, which is a real geopolitical power structure.
[03:52:18.897 --> 03:52:20.478]  It is the Anglo-American establishment.
[03:52:20.478 --> 03:52:22.139]  That's who we're talking about here.
[03:52:22.139 --> 03:52:23.479]  That's the same as this.
[03:52:23.479 --> 03:52:25.340]  They're the same.
[03:52:25.340 --> 03:52:28.062]  These are not conspiracy books.
[03:52:28.062 --> 03:52:38.246]  These are actual historians and professors, and this was also written by Professor Anthony Sutton as well, explaining this power structure in detail.
[03:52:38.246 --> 03:52:40.868]  And Huxley is really just one of these figures that is
[03:52:42.217 --> 03:52:46.259]  An arm of this power structure, one of these people in these circles.
[03:52:46.259 --> 03:52:55.825]  And so his writings are crucial, instrumental to understanding how this control structure works and how it rolls these things out over time.
[03:52:55.825 --> 03:53:05.550]  And so, you know, when we cover Brave New World in depth, we saw that he wasn't just writing something that was a theory or fiction.
[03:53:05.550 --> 03:53:07.351]  It was a plan that would be rolled out.
[03:53:09.543 --> 03:53:17.605]  And I want to say, too, that if you want a deeper analysis of that, I will be covering that in detail this week on my channel.
[03:53:17.605 --> 03:53:24.267]  On my members section, we're going to be covering Heaven and Hell, the essay, that's the second half of this book, The Doors of Perception.
[03:53:24.267 --> 03:53:25.547]  We'll be doing that tonight.
[03:53:25.547 --> 03:53:28.108]  But the Psychonauts are crucial.
[03:53:28.108 --> 03:53:29.669]  The Psychonauts are a big part of this.
[03:53:29.669 --> 03:53:30.809]  I hope you understand that.
[03:53:30.809 --> 03:53:35.310]  But ultimately, all of this is about total control.
[03:53:35.310 --> 03:53:37.271]  So it's not a bunch of different conspiracies.
[03:53:37.271 --> 03:53:37.991]  There's only one
[03:53:38.894 --> 03:53:43.038]  Conspiracy, and it's really just world domination and world power.
[03:53:43.038 --> 03:53:44.820]  That's it.
[03:53:44.820 --> 03:53:48.143]  And a big part of that, as you said, is more than just culture.
[03:53:48.143 --> 03:53:50.105]  It's energy control.
[03:53:50.105 --> 03:54:01.817]  Energy control via, you know, the bringing in of the technocracy, energy control via banning cars, banning stoves, energy control via controlling you, because you are a being that uses energy.
[03:54:03.522 --> 03:54:11.946]  And so controlling population is not just controlling the numbers of the population, it's controlling you on a day-to-day constant basis.
[03:54:11.946 --> 03:54:16.168]  The 15-minute cities, the ESG regulations and control mechanisms.
[03:54:16.168 --> 03:54:24.451]  I noticed I was looking at plane tickets the other day and now there's these alerts about which airlines have more CO2 emissions.
[03:54:24.451 --> 03:54:25.952]  This is ridiculous.
[03:54:25.952 --> 03:54:28.853]  This is all control and social engineering.
[03:54:28.853 --> 03:54:29.954]  Nothing to do with the environment.
[03:54:29.954 --> 03:54:31.114]  100% totally to control you.
[03:54:33.763 --> 03:54:35.944]  And that's what banning meat is.
[03:54:35.944 --> 03:54:38.405]  The vegan movement is part of this.
[03:54:38.405 --> 03:54:40.066]  The Wildlands Project.
[03:54:40.066 --> 03:54:43.888]  The UN Biodiversity Project.
[03:54:43.888 --> 03:54:47.190]  Now you can begin to see why, and anti-family movements, you see.
[03:54:47.190 --> 03:54:50.572]  Now you can begin to see why anti-natalism.
[03:54:50.572 --> 03:54:57.515]  This actually fits in with that Apocalypto human sacrifice religion.
[03:54:57.515 --> 03:55:02.738]  They've just taken the human sacrifice religion of the Mayans, via Apocalypto,
[03:55:03.615 --> 03:55:10.021]  Turn that into a new Earth religion and a new world religion based around worshipping the Earth.
[03:55:10.021 --> 03:55:12.983]  Which, by the way, there was articles in the news last week about this.
[03:55:12.983 --> 03:55:13.944]  Earth Time Magazine.
[03:55:13.944 --> 03:55:19.289]  Earth Day needs to be a new religious holiday for the world.
[03:55:19.289 --> 03:55:21.991]  And that's about Agenda 21.
[03:55:21.991 --> 03:55:23.633]  Go back to the Bush-Rio Treaty.
[03:55:23.633 --> 03:55:29.318]  Agenda 2030, etc.
[03:55:29.318 --> 03:55:30.659]  All of this is the same agenda.
[03:55:31.437 --> 03:55:32.718]  The austerity agenda.
[03:55:32.718 --> 03:55:35.620]  The IMF austerity agenda.
[03:55:35.620 --> 03:55:36.161]  It's this.
[03:55:36.161 --> 03:55:37.262]  It's the same stuff.
[03:55:37.262 --> 03:55:38.463]  You understand?
[03:55:38.463 --> 03:55:53.535]  And so the drug culture contributes to the social revolution because they think they're the tip of the spear, as Jacques Attali calls them in his book, Brief History of the Future.
[03:55:53.535 --> 03:55:55.056]  They think they're the tip of the sphere for
[03:55:56.096 --> 03:56:13.925]  Making a better society when they're actually the tip of the sphere for the final revolution of the enslavement of humanity and the transcending of humanity through transhumanism, as the Huxleys themselves write in their books.
[03:56:13.925 --> 03:56:20.368]  The cleansing of the doors of perception is really just mass mind control.
[03:56:20.368 --> 03:56:23.890]  I'm not saying that everybody that's had a drug experience is mind control.
[03:56:23.890 --> 03:56:24.650]  I'm not saying that.
[03:56:25.382 --> 03:56:37.124]  Saying that the overall strategy of this being let loose on the population, not even through the 60s counterculture, but through Big Pharma.
[03:56:37.124 --> 03:56:41.085]  That is ultimately to control everyone.
[03:56:41.085 --> 03:56:42.965]  Corporate dominance.
[03:56:42.965 --> 03:56:46.306]  Corporate mind control.
[03:56:46.306 --> 03:56:49.926]  And Huxley is ultimately serving that agenda.
[03:56:49.926 --> 03:56:51.007]  And that's what Brave New World is about.
[03:56:51.007 --> 03:56:53.267]  That's what Doors of Perception is ultimately talking about.
[03:56:55.899 --> 03:57:01.040]  It's about controlling you, controlling energy, controlling everything, reducing population.
[03:57:01.040 --> 03:57:04.421]  Remember the Georgia Guidestones?
[03:57:04.421 --> 03:57:05.701]  Vastly reducing it down.
[03:57:05.701 --> 03:57:08.262]  Even Putin has been talking about the golden billion.
[03:57:08.262 --> 03:57:11.042]  Have you heard of this?
[03:57:11.042 --> 03:57:17.604]  Reducing the population down to first a billion, and then they want to get it down to 500 million, and then they want to get it down to even smaller, you see.
[03:57:19.904 --> 03:57:21.425]  That is what all of this is about.
[03:57:21.425 --> 03:57:24.006]  It's in its one single agenda.
[03:57:24.006 --> 03:57:27.707]  And all of these people write about that single agenda in their books.
[03:57:27.707 --> 03:57:30.449]  And I cover that over on my channel.
[03:57:30.449 --> 03:57:31.689]  Head on over to the InfoWars store.
[03:57:31.689 --> 03:57:34.930]  Support the tip of the spear when it comes to fighting this InfoWar.
[03:57:34.930 --> 03:57:37.592]  Go to the InfoWars store and support Alex by getting those products.
[03:57:37.592 --> 03:57:40.473]  And also go to my website and get my books in the shop right there.
[03:57:40.473 --> 03:57:40.853]  See that?
[03:57:40.853 --> 03:57:41.533]  You can go to the shop.
[03:57:41.533 --> 03:57:43.974]  And then we'll be covering Mel Gibson movies tonight on my channel.
[03:57:43.974 --> 03:57:45.315]  Come watch that tonight.
[03:57:46.894 --> 03:57:51.916]  TurboForce is back, sold out for eight months, and it's TurboForce Plus.
[03:57:51.916 --> 03:57:54.077]  We made it even stronger.
[03:57:54.077 --> 03:57:57.719]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[03:57:57.719 --> 03:58:02.961]  TurboForce is back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com or AAA253-3139.
[03:58:02.961 --> 03:58:11.144]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[03:58:11.144 --> 03:58:12.205]  Should be called 10-hour energy.
[03:58:12.885 --> 03:58:25.974]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[03:58:25.974 --> 03:58:27.955]  It is the super fuel.
[03:58:27.955 --> 03:58:29.436]  RainForce Plus is great.
[03:58:29.436 --> 03:58:30.276]  RainForce Ultra is great.
[03:58:30.276 --> 03:58:31.257]  They're two different nootropics.
[03:58:31.257 --> 03:58:32.438]  They go good with this.
[03:58:32.438 --> 03:58:34.459]  But this is the King Kong.
[03:58:35.177 --> 03:58:36.658]  This is the boss.
[03:58:36.658 --> 03:58:37.398]  TurboForce.
[03:58:37.398 --> 03:58:38.419]  Back in stock.
[03:58:38.419 --> 03:58:39.420]  Discounted.
[03:58:39.420 --> 03:58:41.181]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:58:41.181 --> 03:58:42.021]  More power.
[03:58:42.021 --> 03:58:43.022]  More strength.
[03:58:43.022 --> 03:58:47.124]  More energy.
[03:58:47.124 --> 03:58:51.266]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government.
[03:58:51.266 --> 03:58:55.009]  A flying disk has been found and is now in the possession of the army.
[03:58:55.009 --> 03:58:57.390]  There is a bulletin from CBS News.
[03:58:57.390 --> 03:58:59.791]  President Kennedy has been shot.
[03:58:59.791 --> 03:59:02.293]  This is a different kind of war.
[03:59:03.113 --> 03:59:07.560]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and torpedo boats.
[03:59:07.560 --> 03:59:10.985]  The CIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[03:59:10.985 --> 03:59:15.010]  They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[03:59:15.010 --> 03:59:17.614]  It was almost as if it were a planned insult.
[03:59:17.614 --> 03:59:18.716]  It just can't end.
[03:59:19.056 --> 03:59:20.438]  We need to go into the Capitol!
[03:59:20.438 --> 03:59:20.998]  Stop!
[03:59:20.998 --> 03:59:21.899]  Stop!
[03:59:21.899 --> 03:59:22.900]  Stop!
[03:59:22.900 --> 03:59:25.042]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[03:59:25.042 --> 03:59:26.664]  They are nothing but distraction.
[03:59:26.664 --> 03:59:30.007]  You guys censored Harvard educated doctors.
[03:59:30.007 --> 03:59:31.328]  You silenced those voices.
[03:59:31.328 --> 03:59:35.092]  What we want to do in Davos is push the reset button.
[03:59:35.092 --> 03:59:41.879]  Soon as we start exposing the Great Reset, the sooner these globalists start going to prison!
[03:59:50.069 --> 03:59:54.004]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
