[00:00.000 --> 00:04.480]  In the midst of the worst health crisis we're facing in more than a century,
[00:04.480 --> 00:10.080]  don't tell your supporters, don't be afraid of COVID. Everyone should be afraid of COVID.
[00:20.480 --> 00:26.160]  Don't tell your supporters, don't be afraid of COVID. Everyone should be afraid of COVID.
[00:26.160 --> 00:38.320]  I just want to say they gave me Regeneron. We have hundreds of thousands of doses that are just
[00:38.320 --> 00:42.880]  about ready. And if you're in the hospital and you're feeling really bad, we're going to work it
[00:42.880 --> 00:46.800]  so that you get them and you're going to get them free. And especially if you're a senior, we're
[00:46.800 --> 01:04.480]  going to get them. Everyone should be afraid of COVID. Everyone should be afraid of COVID.
[01:04.480 --> 01:06.480]  Everyone should be afraid of COVID.
[01:06.480 --> 01:14.560]  Is there no one who can tell them don't do this?
[01:16.560 --> 01:20.400]  This is an emergency transmission from deep in the heart of Texas. U.S. resistance
[01:20.400 --> 01:24.960]  against a global corporate combine empowered and funded by Communist China ally with the big
[01:24.960 --> 01:30.800]  megabanks that set up Communist China in 1949. The Communist Chinese have taken control of U.S.
[01:30.800 --> 01:34.880]  telecommunications infrastructure. The Communist Chinese have taken control of Hollywood. The
[01:34.880 --> 01:38.800]  Communist Chinese have taken control of the main universities. This is all confirmed. This is not
[01:38.800 --> 01:43.520]  a drill. Big Tech and Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the Communist Chinese government.
[01:43.520 --> 01:49.360]  They've officially become state run. Apple 100%. Google is now making the transition and announcing
[01:49.360 --> 01:54.960]  a merger and total worldwide censorship. They are now beta testing using me as the straw man,
[01:54.960 --> 01:59.040]  a demonized version of Alex Jones to do that. This is happening. This is not like the other
[01:59.040 --> 02:03.840]  probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship, thinking you would adapt
[02:03.840 --> 02:09.440]  the censorship by just putting up with it. Now this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands
[02:09.440 --> 02:15.280]  of times the magnitude of all previous attacks. This is a tight traded dose reverse psychological
[02:15.280 --> 02:21.760]  warfare operation using adapt and overcome subversion paradigm manipulation. In layman's
[02:21.760 --> 02:26.000]  terms, they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed. We adapt to being
[02:26.000 --> 02:32.000]  pressed with the low dosages of oppression. Now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover,
[02:32.000 --> 02:38.160]  we try to adapt to the poison infusion instead of not knowing it's a lethal dose. If we accept the
[02:38.160 --> 02:44.000]  dose, total Internet of Things integration, global social score, complete command and control system.
[02:44.000 --> 02:49.840]  It is the virtual reality AI weapon system now attacking the United States with traders inside
[02:49.840 --> 02:54.720]  the major security agencies, blocking Trump's resistance of the program and attempting to stop
[02:54.720 --> 03:00.000]  us from removing the tentacles of the chai comm slash big tech banking combined emergency situation.
[03:00.000 --> 03:04.080]  I have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information and have been battering,
[03:04.080 --> 03:09.760]  ramming it out as much as I can. They want to double use me as they always do in any complex
[03:09.760 --> 03:15.600]  system of mathematical deception where every angle of my good is turned against us. So they take
[03:15.600 --> 03:20.880]  what I've said, being sincere, build me into an insincere person in the straw man, a person that
[03:20.880 --> 03:25.600]  cares about life and children and is against these wars. And so they make me a herder of children
[03:25.600 --> 03:30.320]  and then they build me into this lie to then set the distraction while they're actually censoring
[03:30.320 --> 03:35.600]  all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones. So even if I didn't sell out to them,
[03:35.600 --> 03:41.600]  they now use me as an archetype to serve them by being the main distraction. I have now been
[03:41.600 --> 03:46.800]  captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum and it's being used against you. Only
[03:46.800 --> 03:52.400]  your full understanding of this key will break you free from this paradigm. I have given you
[03:52.400 --> 04:03.360]  the transmission now break free. I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against
[04:03.360 --> 04:11.680]  every form of tyranny over the mind of man, Thomas Jefferson. If you are receiving this
[04:11.680 --> 04:27.120]  transmission, you are the resistance. And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war
[04:27.120 --> 04:30.800]  and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight,
[04:30.800 --> 04:44.240]  you better believe you got one from the front lines of the information war. It's Alex Jones.
[04:46.720 --> 04:55.440]  We want this transmission officially in T minus 60 seconds. Stand by and if you value your freedom,
[04:55.440 --> 05:04.000]  spread the live links now. We are witnessing a perfect dichotomy of psychological warfare.
[05:04.000 --> 05:08.320]  The United Nations, the big corporations, the globalists, big tech and big pharma are all
[05:08.320 --> 05:13.120]  pushing the covers most deadly thing in history, even though statistically it's a very weak flu
[05:13.120 --> 05:17.760]  or cold. But if you are deficient, then you can actually die from it. That's why you see somebody
[05:17.760 --> 05:23.520]  dying inside the nursing homes. Meanwhile, all these top scientists and researchers and former
[05:23.520 --> 05:28.960]  Pfizer head medical officers have come out and said that the COVID-19 vaccine, especially the mRNA
[05:28.960 --> 05:32.880]  ones, are basically bioweapons that are super deadly. And now they're having to resuscitate
[05:32.880 --> 05:38.000]  people that die basically when they take it, just like newborn babies, they give vaccines.
[05:38.000 --> 05:41.040]  They have to resuscitate them all the time or a lot of times they just let them die.
[05:41.040 --> 05:46.560]  And that's on the record. It does that. Guillain-Marais, narcolepsy, cancer, all these other diseases,
[05:46.560 --> 05:50.160]  but they tell you, safe and effective. No one's getting hurt. It's a conspiracy theory. And then
[05:50.160 --> 05:54.720]  all the fine princess can kill you. Absolutely deadly. So they run from something that isn't
[05:54.720 --> 05:58.720]  dangerous towards something that is incredibly dangerous because the media says it's safe. They
[05:58.720 --> 06:24.720]  do it. Ladies and gentlemen, it is Wednesday, December 16th. The year is 2020. The 35 days out
[06:24.720 --> 06:30.320]  from the attempt by the globalist to install their Communist Chinese agent, we are in an incredible
[06:30.320 --> 06:36.480]  time. America and the rest of the world is under globalist big tech siege, a corporate
[06:36.480 --> 06:46.640]  planetary takeover to replace humans and to make us obsolete. The Von Mies Institute is highly
[06:46.640 --> 06:53.680]  respected with some of the top academics, researchers, economists in the world. They've
[06:53.680 --> 07:03.360]  come out with a big article that's on info wars.com where they say this is a dystopic big tech
[07:06.160 --> 07:17.520]  bio slash digital technocracy. And they describe it exactly as I have described it. We have now
[07:17.520 --> 07:26.400]  videos of people all over Europe, including prestigious top professors being arrested
[07:28.240 --> 07:32.400]  for pointing out that COVID-19 is a giant exaggerated hoax and a power grab.
[07:34.000 --> 07:42.240]  And some of them even being taken to mental institutions, just like we saw in the old Soviet
[07:42.240 --> 07:50.960]  Union. So this is all bona fide tyranny we've seen before. All right, who do we have coming up here
[07:50.960 --> 07:58.960]  on the transmission today? We have constitutional lawyer, Robert Barnes, who will shoot you
[07:58.960 --> 08:03.360]  straight on where Trump really stands. I can tell you he's in liaison with the White House,
[08:03.360 --> 08:05.360]  even though he doesn't want that known, I can tell you that.
[08:05.360 --> 08:13.360]  Because separately, I know the White House doesn't even care now. But he's been out there working
[08:13.360 --> 08:16.960]  hard behind the scenes last month. He's joining us with the latest developments.
[08:18.800 --> 08:22.400]  Then Nick Fuentes, who's really upset with the Republican Party and has his own
[08:23.040 --> 08:27.840]  idea about how they need to be dealt with and punished, he's joining us in the second hour.
[08:27.840 --> 08:37.760]  And then we have some other special guests joining us here today as well, Cassandra Fairbanks,
[08:37.760 --> 08:42.640]  on the Julian Assange situation. She is one of his confidants, and Julian Assange is officially
[08:42.640 --> 08:47.680]  asked today for a pardon. There's been a lot of rumors of that, but it hasn't happened yet.
[08:50.320 --> 08:54.080]  But here's the big news we're going to cover at the start of the next segment.
[08:54.080 --> 09:00.800]  Mitch McConnell and his wife, like a lot of Republicans that went on the Communist Chinese
[09:00.800 --> 09:07.840]  payroll for a long time, the last special prosecutor, Ken Starr, was on the payroll
[09:07.840 --> 09:14.720]  of the Chinese Communist and scuttled that whole situation. And Mitch McConnell is now
[09:15.600 --> 09:22.480]  trying to suppress the Senate from having hearings and investigations into election fraud,
[09:22.480 --> 09:28.800]  but they're still going ahead. So you think about that. He's also saying if we don't concede to
[09:28.800 --> 09:35.840]  Biden, Biden will be able to make us look like sore losers and we'll lose the two Senate seats
[09:35.840 --> 09:46.960]  and lose the Senate in Georgia. Of course, that makes no sense if you look at every angle of it.
[09:48.000 --> 09:50.720]  If you don't expose the fraud, if you don't go in there and stop what they're doing,
[09:50.720 --> 09:54.800]  they're doing mail-in ballots again with no chain of custody, no signature verification,
[09:54.800 --> 09:59.600]  nothing, the Democrats are bragging that they're going to win with the damn mail-in ballots
[09:59.600 --> 10:05.520]  running the scams. And so if Trump doesn't make a big deal of this, and if we don't,
[10:05.520 --> 10:11.280]  even if Trump wins or loses and is able to stop this fraud, he's got to keep pushing and exposing
[10:11.280 --> 10:19.120]  what happened in Georgia, not shut up about it. So the knives are out, folks, and there's no doubt
[10:19.120 --> 10:25.680]  that Mitch McConnell is a super bad dude, a bad, bad operator. And we told you Amy Coleman, Barrett,
[10:25.680 --> 10:30.560]  and we told you Kavanaugh, and we told you all that they were going to betray us.
[10:32.560 --> 10:37.200]  Because they come out of the swamp. They're a bunch of lawyers that have already sold the
[10:37.200 --> 10:41.040]  country to China and others. And to them, that's a business deal that's already been done,
[10:41.040 --> 10:47.360]  you're owned by the globalist. Just like the movie Network 1974, where he gives a speech
[10:47.360 --> 10:54.080]  to Howard Beall about you are owned by global government. You are a piece of stock in this system
[10:55.920 --> 11:02.000]  and you will submit to it. And everything else that comes with it. So we'll cover this next
[11:02.000 --> 11:06.720]  segment. Look at these headlines. McConnell warns the appeal of electoral college brawl in Congress.
[11:08.960 --> 11:13.440]  Trump's got his electors. They've seated theirs. They locked the real electors out of the state
[11:13.440 --> 11:17.120]  houses. We're just supposed to just go along with this and not let the president and the voters
[11:17.120 --> 11:23.360]  of America press their attacks. Yes, they've gotten screwed to legislators. Yes, they've been
[11:23.360 --> 11:27.200]  screwed, you know, so far by most of the governors, because they're all a bunch of cowards.
[11:27.200 --> 11:32.800]  But when you get down to the brass tax, you see mathematics that are impossible in all those states
[11:32.800 --> 11:37.520]  where Trump's winning by two, three, four, five, six points. And then as soon as they quote, close
[11:37.520 --> 11:43.440]  the polls, all these trucks pull up food delivery vehicles, you name it, Chinese men mainly run in
[11:43.440 --> 11:47.920]  with these big containers of ballots. And then inside we have the footage of the workers and
[11:47.920 --> 11:53.760]  they're cramming them in as fast as they can. You have the Chinese government planes landing the day of
[11:54.400 --> 11:59.920]  you have the charter numbers. I mean, private jets flying out of China, landing men running in with
[11:59.920 --> 12:05.600]  big boxes of ballots, people looking both ways, kicking everyone out, pulling out the suitcases.
[12:05.600 --> 12:10.320]  I mean, this is like having surveillance footage of somebody's house getting robbed. I mean,
[12:10.320 --> 12:15.360]  it's all right there. And it's Rand Paul and other senators in the rescue.
[12:16.880 --> 12:23.680]  Second Senator leans towards objecting to electoral college certification. Yes. Told you
[12:23.680 --> 12:31.280]  Rand Paul is a man of honor. That's what we need for present four years. Or maybe a
[12:32.080 --> 12:38.480]  Pence, Paul, Paul, Pence, take it will be good. Meanwhile, Georgia Secretary of State
[12:38.480 --> 12:44.080]  unwittingly provides legal basis for Congress to nullify state's election results. All these
[12:44.080 --> 12:49.520]  different legislators are now ordering and judges to let folks into the actual computer codes that
[12:49.520 --> 12:55.280]  already happened in Michigan. And they said this dominion is designed for total fraud and racketeering.
[12:56.160 --> 13:01.600]  So the proofs there, the corporate media won't allow it to be seen. And they'll block you online
[13:01.600 --> 13:07.680]  if you talk about it. So all that's left is talk radio and info wars. And I told you,
[13:07.680 --> 13:11.920]  Newsmax has come out and said Joe Biden's the president. Others are getting ready to say it
[13:12.560 --> 13:16.400]  because they are twisting arms right now. And that's why it's so vital
[13:16.400 --> 13:21.680]  that info war stay on the air now more than ever, because we will not back down. We will not give
[13:21.680 --> 13:27.920]  him the globals. We will never toe the line with this scientific dictatorship that's taking over
[13:27.920 --> 13:33.280]  and building a post human future. That's the Von Mies Institute now sounding just like me.
[13:33.280 --> 13:39.680]  But it's not Alex Jones. I'm repeating what the globalists said they do. I'm telling you their
[13:39.680 --> 13:46.480]  plan. This is not my opinion. And it's only going to get worse from here on out until we say no
[13:46.480 --> 13:53.440]  to this takeover. A total takeover of every plant animal and human on the face of the earth.
[13:53.440 --> 13:58.640]  It's simply insane. So that's all coming up the latest on the global government takeover
[13:58.640 --> 14:03.680]  lock down to how to stop that incredible developments. Von Mies report I was telling you about
[14:03.680 --> 14:09.600]  also us sleepwalks into lawless future as another Soros back da takes over in Los Angeles.
[14:09.600 --> 14:16.480]  I mean, every major city you look at even in former red areas is falling to this demon
[14:16.480 --> 14:23.360]  who will spend millions per city, 500,000 even for midsize towns. And they are installing Marxist
[14:23.360 --> 14:29.840]  Leninist everywhere to persecute Christians and conservatives and say churches must stay closed.
[14:29.840 --> 14:39.360]  But you can have your football game. You can go to Walmart. Isn't that amazing? So that's all
[14:39.360 --> 14:47.120]  coming up. Also the former head of the CIA and the NSA, General Michael Vincent Hayden has called
[14:47.120 --> 14:54.960]  for my arrest. And just so interesting when he did it yesterday that Oh, all of a sudden we're
[14:54.960 --> 15:01.200]  getting all this information we knew was there. And I guess it's time for the fall Mr Hayden.
[15:02.000 --> 15:06.080]  Now that he wants to arrest us citizens. Yes, that's all coming up.
[15:07.120 --> 15:11.520]  Separately, please keep us on air. Ladies and gentlemen, we do that by you buying products
[15:11.520 --> 15:16.160]  from us. When you buy from Amazon, they're pushing the lockdown. They've doubled their money.

[15:58.160 --> 16:03.120]  Fox has betrayed President Trump as I predicted they would. They've always been part of the
[16:03.120 --> 16:08.000]  establishment and it's only going to get worse. If they're able to keep Trump from rightfully
[16:08.000 --> 16:13.760]  taking office for a second term on January 20th, the system is going to drop the hammer harder
[16:13.760 --> 16:17.840]  than ever on this republic. They are going to explode gas prices. They're going to shut down
[16:17.840 --> 16:22.480]  our coal power plants. They're going to cut off the energy source to the U.S. So it's impossible
[16:22.480 --> 16:27.600]  for factories to move back here. This is economic domination. This is economic war. We are being
[16:27.600 --> 16:32.720]  consolidated. We are being taken over. The Democrats aren't mismanaging their blue cities and states.
[16:32.720 --> 16:37.200]  They're consolidating power and control to bankrupt the population and bring them
[16:37.200 --> 16:42.640]  absolutely to heal and then consolidate ownership of all the infrastructure and property. This is
[16:42.640 --> 16:47.440]  a monopolistic takeover. That's what the great reset is. Klaus Schwab and these other criminals
[16:47.440 --> 16:52.000]  admit it. That's what social distancing is. So your business is only at 25 percent
[16:52.000 --> 16:57.120]  for several more years. No small businesses will be there. This is a master plan. Say no.
[16:58.400 --> 17:04.560]  The U.S. Postal Service tells Info Wars that as long as you get your order in by December 18th
[17:04.560 --> 17:08.480]  and we're able to ship it out by that day, you will get it anywhere in the United States before

[17:57.040 --> 18:03.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:22.240 --> 18:26.320]  Well, the new world order, world government, the robot takeover, the attack on the family,
[18:26.320 --> 18:31.680]  the forced inoculations, the end of our borders. It's not a thing over the horizon anymore.
[18:32.720 --> 18:38.160]  It's not knocking on our door. No, we're inside the cage with it now.
[18:39.680 --> 18:45.440]  That's okay, because now the real fight can begin. Here's China Mitch McConnell,
[18:45.440 --> 18:51.280]  he's known as China Mitch for a reason. Again, yesterday capitulating to the fraud,
[18:51.280 --> 18:58.080]  and then now trying to sabotage any ongoing resistance or exposure of the fraud,
[18:58.080 --> 19:01.120]  which is the real crime. It's one thing if he, an elected official,
[19:01.680 --> 19:05.200]  wants to grovel and sell out to the new world order.
[19:06.480 --> 19:11.360]  But another thing for him to now try to bullwhip everyone into submission in the Congress. Here
[19:11.360 --> 19:21.200]  it is. President-elect is no stranger to the Senate. He's devoted himself to
[19:21.200 --> 19:26.560]  public service for many years. I also want to congratulate the Vice President-elect,
[19:26.560 --> 19:32.080]  our colleague from California, Senator Harris. Beyond our differences, all Americans can take
[19:32.080 --> 19:36.720]  pride that our nation has a female Vice President-elect for the very first time.
[19:38.000 --> 19:41.600]  Okay, we had a little bit of dual audio glitch there, so just so it's on the record,
[19:42.400 --> 19:45.200]  I want you to hear what he actually had to say one more time. Here it is.
[19:45.200 --> 19:48.000]  So today I want to congratulate President-elect Joe Biden.
[19:48.000 --> 19:55.120]  The President-elect is no stranger to the Senate. He's devoted himself to public service for many
[19:55.120 --> 20:00.320]  years. I also want to congratulate the Vice President-elect, our colleague from California,
[20:00.320 --> 20:05.680]  Senator Harris. Beyond our differences, all Americans can take pride that our nation has
[20:05.680 --> 20:09.040]  a female Vice President-elect for the very first time.
[20:09.040 --> 20:16.640]  China Mitch McConnell has family ties to the Bank of China top Chinese shipping firm
[20:18.240 --> 20:26.080]  and a lot more than that. So let's go ahead and roll through all of this and what is unfolding.
[20:26.080 --> 20:32.640]  Here's the Associated Press, Mitch McConnell warns GOP of electoral college brawl in Congress.
[20:32.640 --> 20:36.880]  He goes on to say, without giving the reasons why, that we're going to lose Georgia
[20:36.880 --> 20:47.120]  if we don't stop fighting with the Democrats and if we don't start working with Joe Biden.
[20:47.120 --> 20:52.000]  Now, let's unpack that. The quotes are all right here. To link the article, let's unpack that.
[20:52.000 --> 20:56.960]  Because I read the whole thing this morning and I couldn't find his reasoning. He just says,
[20:57.920 --> 21:01.840]  we're going to lose these two incumbent seats that are so close to this runoff.
[21:01.840 --> 21:10.400]  In Georgia, we can lose the whole Senate if we don't start working with the Democrats.
[21:10.400 --> 21:13.360]  So the Democrats have announced they want to eradicate the Republican Party. The
[21:13.360 --> 21:19.440]  country's very existence. They don't want borders. They're sitting out the same fake mail-in ballots
[21:19.440 --> 21:26.720]  again like they just did. So it's a repeat of all of this. And do you know any Republicans
[21:26.720 --> 21:32.960]  that are energized by hearing we should just give up a non-exposed fraud? Do you hear Republicans
[21:32.960 --> 21:37.200]  thinking, if we are nice to Joe Biden, that that will make more of them go out and vote
[21:38.640 --> 21:43.440]  to try to stop the Democrats taking the Senate? No. You say, we've got to watch those polls.
[21:44.800 --> 21:49.040]  We've got to go out and vote more than ever. We've got to get other people to vote. We've got
[21:49.040 --> 21:54.160]  to be very aggressive. You've got to hold these people's feet to the fire or they're going to
[21:54.160 --> 21:59.840]  steal it again. That's exactly what Trump said a week ago when he visited Georgia. Common sense.
[22:02.640 --> 22:08.000]  No, this is capitulation. This is Mitch McConnell selling the country out. This is evil turtle.
[22:11.040 --> 22:18.320]  As he's known, showing you who he really is when the chips are down. You too, Brutus.
[22:18.320 --> 22:28.000]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen, in what universe does capitulating and saying that Biden
[22:28.000 --> 22:33.840]  really won and certifying the fraud of Georgia and Pennsylvania and Michigan and Nevada and Arizona
[22:34.480 --> 22:41.200]  since when does not having Senate hearings about this since when does not challenging the evidence
[22:41.200 --> 22:48.400]  and senators bringing out the evidence that is incredibly vast of fraud? No, but still we're
[22:48.400 --> 22:52.240]  supposed to bow to the mainstream media again and let them tell us there is no evidence of fraud
[22:52.880 --> 22:57.520]  and have them being announcing since five days after the election when they were still totally
[22:57.520 --> 23:03.600]  in play that he was president-elect to create the self-fulfilling prophecy.
[23:03.600 --> 23:11.600]  Don't worry, a bunch of his family have been named a lucrative board jobs on top
[23:11.600 --> 23:16.080]  communist Chinese corporate corporate leadership boards.
[23:18.480 --> 23:23.760]  So there you go. It just goes on and on and on. This is the sellout of America, but there are others
[23:23.760 --> 23:28.880]  that haven't sold out. Finally, a Republican with a spine will play this video coming up next
[23:28.880 --> 23:35.360]  segment. Governor DeSantis declines reporter's request to acknowledge Joe Biden as president-elect
[23:35.360 --> 23:40.240]  even if they're able to put him in there and have his inauguration, we're never going to accept him.
[23:40.240 --> 23:44.320]  They didn't ever accept Trump said he was a Russian agent with no proof. We have total proof
[23:44.960 --> 23:51.200]  of Biden being a chai-com and Russian agent. So we will never accept him. He is not our president.
[23:51.200 --> 23:56.720]  He is a criminal. He is a fraud. He is a foreign agent with the rest of his degenerate, filthy
[23:56.720 --> 24:04.160]  family tied to the nexium, sex cult, Jeffrey Epstein, the Clintons, and all of it. Joe Biden is a monster.
[24:08.480 --> 24:12.240]  Also breaking, and this is now confirmed. I saw this a couple days ago.
[24:13.760 --> 24:18.800]  This is from Gateway Pundit breaking exclusive owners of solar winds all tied into dominion,
[24:18.800 --> 24:22.880]  you name it, have links to Obama, the Clintons, China, Hong Kong, and the U.S. elections process.
[24:22.880 --> 24:29.200]  And they were rated in Austin, Texas, days ago. And the Pentagon has now shut off all its computers
[24:29.200 --> 24:34.240]  to outside access because of this. And there's all these other articles
[24:36.720 --> 24:40.640]  about Americans don't believe this was a legitimate election Senate committee to hold
[24:40.640 --> 24:48.160]  oversight hearing to examine irregularities for the election tomorrow morning. That is tomorrow.
[24:48.160 --> 24:55.520]  Michigan legislature committee subpoenas election evidence, hard drives, laptops, emails, and Detroit
[24:55.520 --> 25:01.520]  and suburb of Detroit. None of that's on the national news, though. You got to go to infowars.com.
[25:01.520 --> 25:06.640]  You got to go to newswars.com. You got to go to Gateway Pundit.com. This is a RICO case,
[25:06.640 --> 25:11.520]  and it involves potentiality, the incoming president of the United States, assuming he's
[25:11.520 --> 25:19.360]  installed Tom Fenton on Hunter Biden's criminal case. Yeah, exactly. The enemy's not strong.
[25:19.360 --> 25:25.440]  They're failing. They're falling. Their whole system has been exposed. So they need to repudiate
[25:25.440 --> 25:30.480]  this Trump landslide. They need to get control of the executive to protect themselves and clean
[25:30.480 --> 25:35.280]  up what they've done and finish their globalist operation to bankrupt this nation and consolidate
[25:35.280 --> 25:42.400]  control. And that's why they swung for the fences and did a bum rush and did the Hail Marys
[25:42.400 --> 25:47.280]  and just let it all hang out. And now they're just hoping the media can gaslight us and get enough
[25:47.280 --> 25:51.600]  people to just, oh, let's be nice. Oh, the Democrats want to be nice. Oh, they want to be friendly.
[25:51.600 --> 25:57.200]  Meanwhile, they say they're going to never end the lockdown and send no bailout money to red
[25:57.200 --> 26:03.280]  states or red cities. And it will only be to them and just endless trillions as they bring
[26:03.280 --> 26:09.200]  the country to its knees and domesticate the population. And the evil turtle is telling us
[26:09.200 --> 26:14.960]  that Joe Biden's our friend, and that he's a great man, a great statesman, a great public servant.
[26:14.960 --> 26:19.920]  We all know that's a giant stinking lie. My goodness.
[26:22.400 --> 26:28.800]  And continuing. Rand of the rescue, second senator, moves towards objecting the electoral
[26:28.800 --> 26:34.320]  college certification. We'll talk about a constitutional lawyer and expert Robert Barnes
[26:34.320 --> 26:40.160]  on the other side than Nick Fuentes on how do we punish these neocons and rhinos? How do we
[26:40.160 --> 26:45.280]  complete the America first Trumpian Revolution? How do we complete the info war? Because believe
[26:45.280 --> 26:49.360]  me, this is just one stage of the fight. We have been dominating the last four years all over the
[26:49.360 --> 26:54.480]  world. The enemy just struck back. But remember, we are winning in the larger scheme. Stay with us.
[26:54.480 --> 27:00.320]  The project for world government developed by the British Empire via Cecil Rhodes,
[27:00.320 --> 27:05.200]  then picked up by the Rockefeller family and the major Robert Barons, the planet by the 1920s,
[27:05.200 --> 27:10.160]  is all about corporate global governance. And now you're seeing how does the blue states, the blue
[27:10.160 --> 27:15.680]  cities, the communists and socialists, nations all working in unison under UN control, established
[27:15.680 --> 27:21.840]  a medical planetary dictatorship at the core of it is the Fortune 100 corporations themselves
[27:21.840 --> 27:27.040]  funded by a handful of private central banking families, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers,
[27:27.040 --> 27:30.960]  the Dutch and British royalty being at the very heart of that. Then you learn the Dutch and
[27:30.960 --> 27:35.840]  British royalty aren't even Dutch or British at the same time, but they go back to the literal
[27:35.840 --> 27:43.200]  count Dracula and the wars in between Christendom and Islam. Those that don't know history really
[27:43.200 --> 27:48.000]  are doomed to repeat it. They're involved in plotting the world economy. That's what the
[27:48.000 --> 27:52.480]  social distancing the master all about. It's about bankrupting local small businesses and those that
[27:52.480 --> 27:57.920]  comply are complying with your own destruction. Wake up. Most of the world submitted to the
[27:57.920 --> 28:03.520]  unconstitutional criminal lockdowns directed by the communist Chinese and the United Nations.
[28:03.520 --> 28:09.120]  And now because the slaves have proven themselves to be subservient, the worst Australian models
[28:09.120 --> 28:14.080]  of complete lockdowns, you can't even leave your house for months and months are being announced
[28:14.080 --> 28:19.120]  and in Germany, the police are using giant armored tanks with water cannons to blast
[28:19.120 --> 28:24.400]  men, women and children that protest the fact that Merkel the dictator has put them under her control.
[28:24.400 --> 28:29.760]  That's right. She's been rigging elections for years and years and the same thing is coming here
[28:29.760 --> 28:34.320]  to the United States. This is world government in Philadelphia. They've announced four people
[28:34.320 --> 28:39.280]  or more seen together will be arrested. They're announcing the Christmas is canceled. This is
[28:39.280 --> 28:44.560]  what the communist takeover looks like to bankrupt you to take rid of all your due process and
[28:44.560 --> 28:50.880]  absolutely transform the world into a prison planet. How long have we warned you about this?
[28:50.880 --> 28:55.120]  But you can fight back. America is the last bastion. Stop submitting.
[28:55.120 --> 29:13.920]  Now it's easier than ever to have ban.video on your iPhone. Simply go to ban.video with
[29:13.920 --> 29:19.200]  your Safari browser. Then you click the share button at the bottom of the screen. When the menu
[29:19.200 --> 29:25.040]  comes up, you simply click add to home screen. It will then ask you to name the app. I suggest
[29:25.040 --> 29:31.040]  ban.video. You will now have ban.video app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook
[29:31.040 --> 29:34.800]  tried to stop it. The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action,
[29:34.800 --> 29:40.400]  you can override them, have the app and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[29:40.400 --> 29:44.880]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below on your
[29:44.880 --> 29:55.840]  email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube. However you want, be sure and share ban.video.
[30:15.600 --> 30:25.680]  We are on the march. The globalist empires on the run. That's why it's launching these counter
[30:25.680 --> 30:30.320]  offensives. Try to turn us against each other. Try to bankrupt us. Try to distract us with
[30:30.320 --> 30:35.600]  their fraudulent virus. Lock down so that we are brought to our knees. This is the most ancient
[30:35.600 --> 30:42.960]  form of war. This is siege. Ladies and gentlemen, we elected a populist president. Brazil did.
[30:42.960 --> 30:50.400]  The UK did. They passed Brexit multiple times. And yes, these powerful corporate forces that
[30:50.400 --> 30:56.720]  want authoritarianism and centralized corporate rule, they pushed back. But the awakening to
[30:56.720 --> 31:04.080]  the globalist system is 100,000 times bigger than it was 30 years ago. And I'm not exaggerating.
[31:04.080 --> 31:09.840]  It was almost nonexistent. But people that knew about the globalist plan were stunned by it and
[31:09.840 --> 31:16.160]  thought if we warned the public, as this plan comes to fruition, there'll be a great awakening.
[31:16.160 --> 31:22.960]  It was a very simple bet on humanity and it's happening. So as negative as things are and as
[31:22.960 --> 31:28.480]  bad as they are, if you look into the next few years and the next decades and the example we're
[31:28.480 --> 31:32.960]  making right now, these globalists can pull these scams now and may successfully still
[31:32.960 --> 31:36.720]  as election in front of everybody and may try to bring in their permanent martial law. But
[31:36.720 --> 31:42.400]  it's more than just the seeds of their own destruction they've planted. It is the guarantee
[31:42.400 --> 31:47.600]  of that. And Robert Barnes is a smart constitutional lawyer, one of the top guys in the country.
[31:47.600 --> 31:51.200]  He's also a smart historian. I know he concurs on that and we'll get into some positive news
[31:51.200 --> 31:56.000]  next segment. But this segment, Senator Paul and other senators have come out and said, listen,
[31:56.000 --> 32:01.200]  we've seen major evidence of fraud all over the country. The media saying there isn't is a lie.
[32:01.200 --> 32:06.240]  There's not political will to stop this. Everybody's scared. And so we're betraying our own
[32:06.240 --> 32:13.920]  votes and the president and put this chai-com agent in. And he's talking about holding things up
[32:13.920 --> 32:19.040]  during the certification of the electors. And that's why Trump has brought his own electors
[32:19.040 --> 32:26.160]  to walk through the nuts and bolts of this is Robert Barnes, Barnes law, also the Santas of
[32:26.160 --> 32:31.440]  Florida is refusing to acknowledge Biden. And this is the type of leadership we need because
[32:31.440 --> 32:36.640]  it's based, in fact, and an election fraud. But Barnes has been right. Getting into electronic
[32:36.640 --> 32:41.440]  machine's dominion is a sidetrack, even though there's a lot of serious things there. It's the
[32:41.440 --> 32:46.640]  mail in ballots, not following the signatures, violating the law, not having legislators pass
[32:46.640 --> 32:51.360]  laws to do that. That is the total proof. And now it sets the precedent for that to continue.
[32:51.360 --> 32:57.200]  We'll talk about in a moment. But here is Senator Paul just a few hours ago talking about opposing
[32:57.200 --> 33:03.520]  Joe Biden's certification. But the fraud happened. The election in many ways was stolen. And the
[33:03.520 --> 33:09.280]  only way it'll be fixed is by in the future, reinforcing the laws. And the only last comment
[33:09.280 --> 33:13.760]  I would say on what Mr. Krebs, he can speak for himself. But I think his job was keeping the
[33:13.760 --> 33:18.560]  foreigners out of the election. It was the most secure election based on security of the internet
[33:18.560 --> 33:24.640]  and technology. But he never has voiced an opinion he's welcome to today on whether or not dead
[33:24.640 --> 33:29.840]  people voted. I don't think he examined that. Did he examine noncitizens voting? So to say it was
[33:29.840 --> 33:35.040]  the safest election, sure, I agree with your statement. If you're referring to foreign intervention,
[33:35.040 --> 33:40.000]  but if you're saying it's the safest election based on no dead people voted, no sans citizens
[33:40.000 --> 33:45.040]  voted, no people broke the absentee rules, I think that's false. And I think that's what's upset a
[33:45.040 --> 33:50.080]  lot of people on our side is that they're taking your statement to mean, Oh, well, there was no
[33:50.080 --> 33:54.240]  problem in the elections. I don't think you examined any of the problems that we've heard here.
[33:54.240 --> 33:58.720]  So really, you're just referring to something differently is what I the way I look at it.
[33:58.720 --> 34:03.360]  And that's Senate hearings going on now more tomorrow. And again, evil turtle Mitch McConnell is
[34:03.360 --> 34:10.400]  trying to block that saying that will get the Democrats in a position to win the Senate in
[34:10.400 --> 34:15.600]  Georgia. Because if we're not accepting them, we're bad, and then people will then vote against
[34:15.600 --> 34:21.680]  the Republicans. That holds no water with me. What do you want to tackle first? Just where we
[34:21.680 --> 34:25.600]  are historically what's happening, the latest developments, you've got the floor here, Robert
[34:25.600 --> 34:31.760]  Barnes. Well, I mean, just at the outset, the fact that they were willing to call Krebs in today,
[34:32.640 --> 34:37.600]  just a day or two after it turned out, he this was the guy that was responsible for making sure
[34:37.600 --> 34:43.040]  our cyber infrastructure stayed safe, independent of and separate and beyond the election. Well,
[34:43.040 --> 34:47.920]  he completely failed his job for eight months. There had been one of the worst hacks ever.
[34:47.920 --> 34:52.960]  The hack that involves the company there in Austin, and he completely missed it. He didn't
[34:52.960 --> 35:00.080]  find it ever. It took him being fired to have his successor discover that it took place. So
[35:00.080 --> 35:05.280]  it's amazing Democrats putting this nitwit up, probably the worst protector of cybersecurity
[35:05.280 --> 35:11.280]  in American history as any kind of evidentiary witness of any utility or credibility, given
[35:11.280 --> 35:17.120]  that the SolarWinds hack happened right under his nose. And it happened eight months before
[35:17.120 --> 35:22.320]  without him even discovering it. And they're calling it maybe the worst hack of the US government
[35:22.320 --> 35:27.760]  security in our history. And that guy's talking about credibility of elections. I mean, it's
[35:27.760 --> 35:33.120]  just a chronic. I'll give Democrats the credit for being willing to go to any lengths to put any
[35:33.120 --> 35:39.120]  witness up to try to justify what happened. But secondly, the key thing is definitely the
[35:39.120 --> 35:44.400]  challenging the senators. I put up a draft letter on a little Dave Rubin's local's board, our
[35:44.400 --> 35:50.240]  Viva Barnes law local's board to send for everybody to contact and people can do it in their own
[35:50.240 --> 35:56.560]  ways by phone, by fax, by email, by regular mail, contact their senators, put it in every
[35:56.560 --> 36:02.000]  senator, just not only your own senator, contact Senator Paul, contact Senator Johnson, contact
[36:02.000 --> 36:09.120]  senators, Senator Holly, contact Senator Cruz, contact all of them because they need to hear
[36:09.120 --> 36:13.120]  from the public that there needs to be an objective. Let's be clear. We don't want just
[36:13.120 --> 36:18.000]  rhetoric like Holly and Paul have done so far. I think they're both good men. We heard a lot of
[36:18.000 --> 36:21.600]  rhetoric about going after big tech. The last couple of years, they didn't do it. We need teeth
[36:21.600 --> 36:25.600]  now. We need them to really go after them. How should they do that? Just have hearings, get up
[36:25.600 --> 36:30.640]  there, block it, filibuster it and don't don't certify this as all this new evidence of fraud
[36:30.640 --> 36:38.320]  comes out. At a minimum, all we have to have is one senator join Mo Brooks and the other congressman
[36:38.320 --> 36:43.120]  and object to the certification of electors for all of the contested and disputed states.
[36:43.120 --> 36:48.720]  That's it. They can at least do that. Then what happens is the House and the Senate will vote on
[36:48.720 --> 36:55.600]  it. They have to have hearings. Now that my recommendation is that everybody asks their
[36:55.600 --> 37:02.880]  senators to come out publicly and make a statement that they will object unless all of these contested
[37:02.880 --> 37:10.480]  states provide a meaningful signature match on it and publish all the ballots because they already
[37:10.480 --> 37:15.760]  have them digitized prior to January 6th because that's a very reasonable request. That's just
[37:15.760 --> 37:20.640]  that's not even asking the senator to commit to objecting. If in fact that event occurs, that's
[37:20.640 --> 37:27.440]  not asking them to sustain an objection. It's just saying, hey, at a minimum, make use your power as
[37:27.440 --> 37:32.640]  a United States senator and your ability to object to say you're not going to certify an election
[37:32.640 --> 37:36.080]  when the state has not allowed an audit of the signature. Let me ask you this. What do you make
[37:36.080 --> 37:40.640]  a Mitch McConnell not just conceding to Biden when there's so much more fighting to do but
[37:40.640 --> 37:45.600]  actually congratulating him and saying he's a great public servant and now I'm sure you saw the AP
[37:45.600 --> 37:50.880]  article running around saying, you know, don't talk about fraud, be nice to Democrats or we're
[37:50.880 --> 37:56.800]  going to lose in Georgia. Under what logic does that operate? The guy's incompetent. I was down
[37:56.800 --> 38:01.920]  there in Georgia, met with the Georgia campaign people right after the election. I and a whole
[38:01.920 --> 38:06.880]  bunch of other people on behalf of Trump told them that the recount and challenging and contesting
[38:06.880 --> 38:12.320]  the election was the best strategy for the runoff. They refused to listen. They ignored it. Both of
[38:12.320 --> 38:18.720]  these Georgia Republicans continue to engage in stock deals that are impacted by their legislation.
[38:18.720 --> 38:24.400]  They refuse to change their position on that. And so and then they refuse to commit to objecting.
[38:24.400 --> 38:29.920]  So the my other specific suggestion to them three weeks ago with Sonny Perdue and other people
[38:29.920 --> 38:34.480]  in the room and it's his cousin that's running for the Senate and it's he who really runs.
[38:34.480 --> 38:37.760]  And then you've got all these high level Chinese government officials meeting
[38:37.760 --> 38:41.600]  with governors all over the country where these weird deals happen and giving them money
[38:41.600 --> 38:45.520]  and deals and their families. I mean, I guess they they're bought and paid for. That's why
[38:45.520 --> 38:50.640]  they're acting like this. Well, I have no doubt that watch what happens with when McConnell's
[38:50.640 --> 38:55.680]  wife leaves the cabinet and cash is in at the secretary of treasurer. I mean, at the secretary
[38:55.680 --> 39:00.000]  of transportation position that she was given by the president. Watch a whole bunch of what's the
[39:00.000 --> 39:05.120]  McConnell wealth magically increase the amount. I have no doubt that Sonny Perdue will do just fine
[39:05.120 --> 39:11.040]  financially after all of this. So the the effect is it leads an inference that they will all along
[39:11.040 --> 39:16.160]  these people were undermining the president. And now it's like the Godfather line when the
[39:16.160 --> 39:19.760]  Marlon Brando's character says he should have seen it was that one guy all along.
[39:19.760 --> 39:23.920]  It was Mitch McConnell all along betraying and undermining and sabotaging the president.
[39:23.920 --> 39:28.720]  It's not a coincidence. It was his attorney general in Kentucky, who was the only one to
[39:28.720 --> 39:33.600]  refuse to speak out or join the Texas lawsuit. So now the president knows that these were
[39:33.600 --> 39:37.680]  traders in his own house. Well, yeah, Trump's called basically for the arrest of the governor
[39:37.680 --> 39:42.080]  of Georgia. I mean, these people are criminals. We need to let's talk about Trump. What Trump
[39:42.080 --> 39:47.120]  should do where Trump's really at where we're at with Robert Barnes where this election really is
[39:47.120 --> 39:54.480]  right now with 35 days of inauguration. Robert Barnes, our guest, stay with us.
[39:59.760 --> 40:04.960]  It's been said that you should strike while the iron is hot. Well, info wars is white hot right
[40:04.960 --> 40:10.880]  now. World government, globalist forces trying to take over the United States is mainstream news.
[40:10.880 --> 40:16.240]  And info wars credibility has gone through the roof. That's why now is the time to contact

[40:54.800 --> 40:58.320]  Webster's dictionary has a very simple definition of terrorism.
[40:58.960 --> 41:04.400]  Other dictionaries have similar ones. Terrorism is the threat of force or actually carrying out
[41:04.400 --> 41:11.280]  force for a political or financial reason. It's basically scaring the hell out of people
[41:11.280 --> 41:16.320]  until you submit to them. That's exactly what all this overblown COVID-19 garbage is.
[41:16.320 --> 41:21.200]  You see the headlines from CNN, ABC News. Doctors say it's worse than they ever thought.
[41:21.200 --> 41:26.480]  COVID more devastating than they ever imagined. They told us that two and a half million people
[41:26.480 --> 41:33.040]  would be dead just eight months ago within three months. Okay. It's a quarter million if you count
[41:33.040 --> 41:38.160]  all of the people that died of other things. We're talking 96% had co-morbidity. These are
[41:38.160 --> 41:42.960]  real numbers. These are real facts. This is the chicken little event where we all run our houses,
[41:42.960 --> 41:47.120]  never come out and are taught we're not essential. All the big box stores in Amazon take over the
[41:47.120 --> 41:53.280]  planet. Rebuke it, stand up against it. This is slavery. It is not something you can put up with
[41:53.280 --> 42:02.240]  and survive. Hey Steve, how you doing? Hey Alex. Oh my God. Long time listener, first time caller.
[42:02.240 --> 42:07.600]  Look, in January, 2016, I went in the hospital. I went to VA hospital out here in Boystein. I was
[42:07.600 --> 42:12.320]  in there until June and I kept hearing Dr. Group and all you guys talking about living defense.
[42:12.320 --> 42:17.920]  Let me tell you something, man. I had an internal digestive problem and I stuck with it for about
[42:17.920 --> 42:22.800]  five or six years and the doctors, they tried every test. Nobody could figure out what it is.
[42:22.800 --> 42:26.480]  And then every day when I kept hearing you and Dr. Group and those commercials, I said,
[42:26.480 --> 42:29.920]  you know what? I'm going to get me some of that freaking living defense. Now I wasn't supposed
[42:29.920 --> 42:33.840]  to have any nutritionals because they don't want you to have it. But I ordered it, had it shipped
[42:33.840 --> 42:39.600]  to me. I got it. I hid it from the nurses. I started taking it, man. That stuff changed my life.
[42:39.600 --> 42:44.000]  It saved my life. If there's any veteran out there, I don't give you travel though, anybody's
[42:44.000 --> 42:50.080]  traveled overseas, you absolutely owe it to yourself to get two bottles of that living defense.
[42:50.080 --> 42:54.800]  It's true, folks. We don't sell anything unless it's the highest quality and living defense is
[42:54.800 --> 42:58.400]  over the top good. The best product. I'm not supposed to be biased, but I'm going to tell you
[42:58.400 --> 43:03.840]  all now. If you haven't tried Turboforce, you need to try it. I've tried Turboforce with everything.
[43:03.840 --> 43:07.920]  Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy. I put Turboforce in my coffee. That was a crazy
[43:07.920 --> 43:11.840]  week. I don't remember sleeping, but as far as the products go, Turboforce is my favorite,
[43:11.840 --> 43:15.760]  and all the Infowars products are down to taking control of your life, taking control of your health,
[43:16.960 --> 43:21.200]  not relying on other people to do it for you. Nobody wakes up in the morning
[43:22.560 --> 43:25.840]  and thinks, I'm going to give that person over there a better life. I'm going to wake up today.
[43:25.840 --> 43:29.760]  You know what? I'm going to spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier,
[43:29.760 --> 43:33.280]  happier, and richer. I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend. I don't think
[43:33.280 --> 43:36.560]  that happens very often. It's never happened to me. I've never had anyone knock on my door and
[43:36.560 --> 43:40.080]  said, Tate, you're such a good guy. How can I improve your life in every single way? There's
[43:40.080 --> 43:44.000]  only one person who woke up and fought that, and that was me. I woke up and thought, you know what?
[43:44.000 --> 43:47.200]  Okay, I want to take control of my life. I want to take control of my health, and that's why I
[43:47.200 --> 43:50.640]  need to go to Infowars.com. Take control of your health right now and support the resistance.
[43:50.640 --> 43:54.640]  Don't buy into the group thing. Don't drink the Kool-Aid. Drink the Turboforce. Kool-Aid's bad,
[43:54.640 --> 44:10.560]  and the Turboforce is good. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[44:10.560 --> 44:26.640]  Welcome back to Alex Jones. Robert Barnes is our gas constitutional lawyer,
[44:26.640 --> 44:32.080]  but working with the Trump campaign and others on the election fraud. Give us the big picture of
[44:32.080 --> 44:36.560]  where we are. Is it over for Trump? What's the reality? Are there any long shots?
[44:36.560 --> 44:42.320]  Why are we going after an election fraud when it's about him being a CHICOM agent? There's so
[44:42.320 --> 44:48.160]  many angles of this, Robert Barnes. Absolutely. So fundamentally, our election was done in a manner
[44:48.160 --> 44:53.040]  where people who were not qualified to vote voted. People who cast ballots in a manner that was
[44:53.040 --> 44:56.800]  illegal, that doesn't require proving fraud or forgery, it's just they didn't meet the rules
[44:56.800 --> 45:01.120]  and the way they cast their ballots, and the way the ballots were counted was not done in a
[45:01.120 --> 45:06.800]  constitutionally consistent, openly transparent, legally cognizable manner. Given that, the question
[45:06.800 --> 45:11.200]  is, what's the remedy? Ideally, the remedy would have been meaningful recounts and recanvases and
[45:11.200 --> 45:16.640]  audits by the election officials, but they have refused. The next remedy ideally would have been
[45:16.640 --> 45:21.680]  the courts, but the Supreme Court is hiding underneath their desks. So that leaves one
[45:21.680 --> 45:26.640]  constitutional remedy, which has always been the ultimate constitutional remedy, which is for
[45:26.640 --> 45:31.280]  Congress to take action. The Senator McConnell yesterday said that when the Electoral College
[45:31.280 --> 45:35.840]  voted, that was a process that was final. That's completely false. First of all, the Electoral
[45:35.840 --> 45:40.320]  College hasn't actually meaningfully voted because their votes are sealed. Nobody knows actually
[45:40.320 --> 45:44.720]  for sure what their votes are. You don't know for sure what their votes are until they're open
[45:44.720 --> 45:50.320]  and counted under the Constitution on January 6th by the Vice President of the United States
[45:50.320 --> 45:55.920]  as the President of the Senate. The first step that could happen is Vice President Pence has,
[45:55.920 --> 46:01.840]  according to many legal scholars, including legal scholars on the left, the non-delegable,
[46:01.840 --> 46:07.920]  non-reviewable plenary power to declare which electors were actually elected from the state
[46:07.920 --> 46:13.280]  to this issue. So in this case, the President's electors also met in many states. They cast
[46:13.280 --> 46:18.480]  ballots for the President. Under various liberal, even liberal legal interpretations,
[46:18.480 --> 46:23.120]  Vice President Pence does have the power to declare the President's electors,
[46:23.120 --> 46:27.920]  the actual electors from those states. There's a statute, the Electoral Count Act,
[46:27.920 --> 46:33.200]  which provides certain kinds of limitations, but that act is subject to the Constitution,
[46:33.200 --> 46:37.760]  and the 12th Amendment appears to give Vice President Pence undisputable,
[46:37.760 --> 46:38.560]  irrefutable...
[46:38.560 --> 46:43.440]  CNN had an article saying that Mike Pence is going to put the seal on Donald Trump's defeat.
[46:44.400 --> 46:48.080]  Why do they think he would do that? I mean, they admit he has that power. If they see fraud to
[46:48.080 --> 46:54.560]  not certify it, are they thinking that he will stab Trump in the back or what? Yes. I mean,
[46:54.560 --> 46:58.640]  that's in fact what's going on. Now, part of it is they're pretending that the Constitution doesn't
[46:58.640 --> 47:02.720]  say what it does. They're pretending these lower-view articles don't exist. They're pretending that
[47:04.080 --> 47:08.000]  and then to some degree, there's recognition that Pence is unlikely to come to actual Trump's defense,
[47:08.000 --> 47:13.280]  but people should know Pence does have this power. And the way to think of it is just imagine if this
[47:13.280 --> 47:19.920]  was Joe Biden in 2012 and the roles were reversed, or just imagine it was Kamala Harris. I mean,
[47:19.920 --> 47:25.040]  does anyone have any doubt that Kamala Harris or Joe Biden on behalf of Barack Obama would have
[47:25.040 --> 47:30.160]  actually contested the electors? So the media would be having an entirely different spin right now
[47:30.720 --> 47:35.840]  saying how, in fact, the Vice President can contest the electors if they are actually
[47:35.840 --> 47:40.320]  are contested. Actually, if they try to do that back at the time, remember Pelosi's daughter tried
[47:40.320 --> 47:46.160]  to get a movement to do that. That's exactly right. And in fact, now, so that's stage one,
[47:46.160 --> 47:50.160]  assuming the Vice President doesn't do it. And there's reasons to doubt that Pence is truly loyal
[47:50.160 --> 47:55.440]  to Trump. During Access Hollywood, Pence was trying to navigate Trump out so that he could be top
[47:55.440 --> 48:02.160]  of the ticket in 2016. It was Pence who helped drive Flynn out. It was Pence who helped negotiate
[48:02.160 --> 48:07.840]  with Ecuador to get Julian Assange arrested and extradited. So Pence has not been a real Trump
[48:07.840 --> 48:12.960]  ally. And a lot of the never Trumpers and problem people have come from Pence's group of people
[48:12.960 --> 48:17.280]  and his staff in the White House. So assuming Pence does not come to the president's rescue,
[48:17.280 --> 48:22.080]  but the world should know he could have. So when he doesn't, everybody should put that process that
[48:22.080 --> 48:27.120]  the House in the Senate under the Electoral Account Act can object. And all that requires is one
[48:27.120 --> 48:32.240]  member of the House and one member of the Senate. They do not have to be from the same state. They
[48:32.240 --> 48:36.800]  do not have to be from the same state as being contested. All it has to be is just one House
[48:36.800 --> 48:42.560]  member and one senator. Mo Brooks has already said he will be filing an objection as to the
[48:42.560 --> 48:48.560]  electors from Arizona, from Georgia, from Michigan, from Wisconsin, from Pennsylvania and Nevada.
[48:48.560 --> 48:54.560]  And why? Because the election was done in a manner that was directly contrary and contradicted by
[48:54.560 --> 48:59.200]  the Constitution of the United States. Absolutely. As 19 attorney generals have already said in their
[48:59.200 --> 49:04.080]  filing before the U.S. Supreme Court, as 126 members of the House of Representatives have
[49:04.080 --> 49:08.880]  already said before the United States Supreme Court, as leading state legislators from the
[49:08.880 --> 49:13.440]  states in dispute have already said before the United States Supreme Court and public interest
[49:13.440 --> 49:18.880]  groups like the Amistad Project and the Thomas More Society have done. So all we need is one
[49:18.880 --> 49:23.040]  senator to say, yes, I'll join in the objection. And then they have to hold hearings for at least
[49:23.040 --> 49:28.000]  two hours in each of the chambers where ideally they should be able to present evidence or allow
[49:28.000 --> 49:32.880]  evidence to be presented. And that could turn this whole thing around. But instead, the Supreme
[49:32.880 --> 49:36.880]  Court is hiding under its desk. Some legislature has done the right thing. They've gotten evidence
[49:36.880 --> 49:41.840]  of fraud. The forensic experts have said this is organized crime. They've got the evidence of
[49:41.840 --> 49:47.680]  pulling out those suitcases and stuffing things. But is there the political will here? Let's be
[49:47.680 --> 49:53.840]  realistic. This is Americans as citizens. You called me on the phone a week ago, long shot for
[49:53.840 --> 49:58.880]  Trump. You said that on air. Now is it a long shot, long shot, whole in one? I mean, what are we
[49:58.880 --> 50:05.840]  really looking at here? I mean, I think that I designed a draft letter that people can copy and
[50:05.840 --> 50:11.920]  paste and use. No copyright, anything else. We'll find a put up a link on info wars at some point
[50:11.920 --> 50:17.040]  that goes where it is. And we'll post it on info wars. There it is. It's a Viva Barnes law. And
[50:17.040 --> 50:23.600]  where is that located? draft? It's a Dave Rubin's locals board. So Viva Barnes law dot locals.com.
[50:23.600 --> 50:28.080]  And it's right pin to the top. People can cut and paste from it. People can change it. However,
[50:28.080 --> 50:34.000]  they want no copyright. They can use it. However, they want the goal is massive, massive public
[50:34.000 --> 50:39.120]  pressure on the senators because you're already seeing that McConnell's wall that he's trying to
[50:39.120 --> 50:44.960]  build is already cracking today. When you have Senator Johnson doing saying what he said, Senator
[50:44.960 --> 50:50.560]  Paul saying what he said. Now, where was Josh Hawley? Josh Hawley wants to be the next president.
[50:50.560 --> 50:55.120]  He's the senator from Missouri. He has future presidential aspirations. He wasn't he was a
[50:55.120 --> 50:59.440]  no show today. And explain to people this is the path to victory. One of the last shots here,
[50:59.440 --> 51:02.880]  a very strong one, but we need leadership recap what needs to happen right now.
[51:04.080 --> 51:08.160]  People need to reach out to every United States Senator put as much pressure on every United
[51:08.160 --> 51:13.120]  States Senator and tell those United States senators, they must publicly state that they will
[51:13.120 --> 51:18.960]  object to the certification of any elector. If the states in question fail to provide an audit
[51:18.960 --> 51:25.840]  of the vote prior to January 6. And then the same logic of McConnell all over the news saying, oh,
[51:25.840 --> 51:30.960]  if we don't certify him, and if we're not nice to Biden, we're going to lose Georgia on what planet
[51:30.960 --> 51:36.000]  that's not challenging all this fraud, make Republicans be energized that that just flies
[51:36.000 --> 51:41.680]  the face of logic. Exactly. In fact, what I told both the Lefler, Lefler's team and Purdue's team
[51:41.680 --> 51:47.680]  when I was down there was they should both run in Georgia saying if you elect me, I will object to
[51:47.680 --> 51:53.200]  the certification of electors from Georgia and other states unless election transparency procedures
[51:53.200 --> 51:58.000]  are met before the election. And if they put Trump on the ballot, because it's the day before
[51:58.000 --> 52:04.000]  January 6 is the runoff date in is January 5 in Georgia, put Trump on the ballot in Georgia and
[52:04.000 --> 52:08.080]  say vote for me and I will object to the certification of any electors from these
[52:08.080 --> 52:13.200]  contested states that refuse to provide election transparency. And they would have a rallying
[52:13.200 --> 52:18.240]  effect and they could win reelection. Whereas right now, they are almost guaranteed to lose
[52:18.240 --> 52:23.280]  by playing with the Mitch McConnell turtle script. And that is what you said is so huge.
[52:23.280 --> 52:26.960]  Repeat that. No, we'll do five more minutes with us. I know you got to go that point is
[52:26.960 --> 52:31.440]  just coming over to break, but explain that because that's that's true. If they ran on
[52:31.440 --> 52:36.480]  election fraud, which is the energizing issue, it'll put heat on those trying to steal it again.
[52:36.480 --> 52:40.160]  There's a good chance we'll catch them with their pants down. And then they can turn around and say,
[52:40.160 --> 52:45.040]  we will then go back and we will challenge this today before be heroes. That's Luke Skywalker
[52:45.040 --> 52:50.080]  firing photon torpedoes down the reactor shaft of the Death Star. Robert Barnes is our guest.
[52:50.080 --> 52:53.680]  We'll go to break. We'll come right back with him. The Nick Pointes, who is just totally angry
[52:53.680 --> 52:58.880]  the Republicans. And it shows the public is he's been doing videos that are getting three, four,
[52:58.880 --> 53:04.800]  five, six million views every one of them. So any and his message is destroy the Republican party,
[53:04.800 --> 53:09.920]  take it over. I totally agree. But I'm just saying that number of views, even when censorship shows
[53:09.920 --> 53:14.080]  you this is the issue, of course, they'll tell us run away from it. You know, all the Democrats
[53:14.080 --> 53:18.880]  will get elected. No, we mean, don't go for establishment Republicans, go for good ones,
[53:18.880 --> 53:24.720]  libertarian ones, populist ones, Christian ones, and then Trumpist ones, info or style people.
[53:24.720 --> 53:29.840]  And then the rest will get scared and get on board with us. This is real simple politics, folks.
[53:29.840 --> 53:32.960]  But the evil turtle doesn't want you to know that. We'll back with Barnes in a moment.
[53:32.960 --> 53:35.440]  Please remember, you have up until Friday evening.
[53:35.440 --> 53:40.160]  You get your orders in to be guaranteed delivery anywhere in the United States. That means Alaska,
[53:40.160 --> 53:46.480]  Hawaii. You've got still really Monday in the continental United States have the maps from
[53:46.480 --> 53:52.240]  the USPS. So if you're orders in by Monday, anywhere in the lower 48, folks will get their
[53:52.240 --> 53:56.560]  package before Christmas. But if you want it anywhere, the most remote areas, guarantee your
[53:56.560 --> 54:02.240]  orders in by Friday, we'll get them all shipped out by Saturday and get some busy little elves here

[54:06.560 --> 54:11.680]  We've got three or four or five times the audience we had last year. But the money's not as big as
[54:11.680 --> 54:15.520]  it was because I know the economy's in trouble and, you know, the globalist lockdown's bad. But

[55:14.800 --> 55:20.160]  warfare of the truth in the fight against the globalist. But now is the time to redouble all
[55:20.160 --> 55:24.160]  our efforts in praying for a great awakening, which is starting to happen and spreading the word
[55:24.160 --> 55:32.000]  about info wars.com, news wars.com and band.video. And at the very same time, buying amazing products

[55:45.600 --> 55:49.920]  The Pope came out yesterday and announced a global government corporate alliance to
[55:49.920 --> 55:54.800]  redistribute wealth and create a planetary universal income, which of course the United
[55:54.800 --> 55:58.960]  Nations and global corporations will control through the apps on your phone and finally a chip
[55:58.960 --> 56:05.760]  under your skin. It's all now completely official. Part of the UN great reset of the Debo Scoop and
[56:05.760 --> 56:11.120]  Cloud Schwab, all officially written about in hundreds of books by Schwab and Rockefeller Foundation,
[56:11.120 --> 56:16.560]  all the rest of them, Agenda 21, Agenda 2030, it's here. And only gets worse like being fed into a
[56:16.560 --> 56:23.840]  wood chipper or a meat grinder until you reject it all. And the rejection starts with realizing
[56:23.840 --> 56:30.000]  its spiritual battle to first evil and stopping abortion. We must start valuing human life again.
[56:30.000 --> 56:36.960]  We must start saying that we are not expendable, that we are not disposable, that we are essential.
[56:36.960 --> 56:43.040]  Until we do that, we are all slaves. We must stand up and declare our basic God given human rights
[56:43.040 --> 56:49.040]  now.
[56:49.040 --> 56:55.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[57:06.000 --> 57:11.280]  All right, Robert Barnes was so busy he couldn't host the election countdown, but he's back week
[57:11.280 --> 57:17.360]  nights, seven to nine p.m. most nights with John Lorraine. And he's laying out some of the negative
[57:17.360 --> 57:23.520]  stuff here and some of the silver linings. But also, big picture, he was on my show last week,
[57:23.520 --> 57:27.840]  did a really great job. And I concur with his analysis of how this is actually going to devastate
[57:27.840 --> 57:33.520]  the globalist, what they've done. And he gave the Jacksonian historical blueprint of that. But
[57:33.520 --> 57:38.320]  recap what you were just saying up against the break about Georgia and the path to victory there.
[57:38.320 --> 57:44.320]  And why would McConnell be sabotaging that? So I mean, I think McConnell has never wanted to
[57:44.320 --> 57:49.760]  sort of Trumpism or Trump in the party. He just used Trump to leverage his appointees.
[57:49.760 --> 57:54.400]  And many of the judges that he put in are more loyal to him and the institutional Republican
[57:54.400 --> 57:58.480]  party than they are to the president, as we've all witnessed over the last several weeks.
[57:58.480 --> 58:05.040]  If the Republicans were smart in the Senate for both the Purdue campaign and the Lefler campaign,
[58:05.040 --> 58:10.240]  what they would campaign on is the only way the president has a chance is if they get re-elected
[58:10.240 --> 58:16.560]  to the Senate and they agree to object to the certification of any electors from any state
[58:16.560 --> 58:22.160]  that has refused to allow an audit of the signature matches, that has refused to publish the ballots.
[58:22.160 --> 58:26.080]  Remember, everybody, they digitize these ballots so all these ballots could be published to the
[58:26.080 --> 58:31.280]  world. In fact, the Georgia Secretary of State promised he would. What is in those ballots
[58:31.280 --> 58:36.880]  that they are so scared to publish them to the world? Is the numbering off? Do the ballots look
[58:36.880 --> 58:41.600]  weird? Do they look like they came from someplace else? Do they look like they may have been test
[58:41.600 --> 58:46.480]  ballots improperly included? What is in those ballots that the Georgia Secretary of State is
[58:46.480 --> 58:51.280]  so scared to show the world? What is in those signatures that the Georgia Secretary of State
[58:51.280 --> 58:56.880]  is so scared to show the world? So both Senate Republicans, candidates should run on, elect me
[58:56.880 --> 59:01.280]  and I will object to the certification of any elector from any state, including Georgia,
[59:01.280 --> 59:06.560]  that did not have an open, transparent, honest vote process. And that is the only chance we have
[59:06.560 --> 59:11.120]  for President Trump to be constitutionally re-elected is by objecting to the certification
[59:11.120 --> 59:15.440]  of electors from the questionable contested states. And what should happen is if they throw out
[59:15.440 --> 59:20.960]  enough electors, then it goes to the House to vote by state delegation under the 12th Amendment,
[59:20.960 --> 59:26.400]  not to vote by majority vote. So Pelosi doesn't control that. It's by state delegation where
[59:26.400 --> 59:32.160]  Republicans have at least a four state edge. So the only chance the President has is to elect
[59:32.160 --> 59:36.880]  these two Republicans to the Senate if they campaign that way in Georgia, because they need
[59:36.880 --> 59:41.120]  a majority vote out of the Senate to be able to sustain the objections to the electors.
[59:41.120 --> 59:44.080]  And that's what they should run on. They should say that that's what they're going to do. And
[59:44.080 --> 59:48.400]  again, they're not even committing to vote a certain way. They're only saying if these states
[59:48.400 --> 59:53.760]  refuse to allow an audit in an open, transparent process, then they won't certify the electors
[59:53.760 --> 59:59.520]  from those states. All we need is one senator to join any House member. We already have the
[59:59.520 --> 1:00:04.240]  House members no matter what. So all the pressure needs to be focused on the Senate. We just need
[1:00:04.240 --> 1:00:08.880]  one United States senator to step up to the plate and say we will not certify electors
[1:00:08.880 --> 1:00:13.440]  from an election that was not done in an open, honest and transparent manner and give all of
[1:00:13.440 --> 1:00:19.600]  these states two weeks, give them notice, say this is what I'm going to do unless you fix it,
[1:00:19.600 --> 1:00:24.160]  unless you allow an audit of the signature matches, unless you allow an audit of the machines,
[1:00:24.160 --> 1:00:29.760]  unless you allow an audit, a full publishing of all the paper ballots and show them to the world
[1:00:29.760 --> 1:00:35.440]  in digitized scan form. And if you do that, then I won't object, but put the pressure on the states
[1:00:35.440 --> 1:00:39.200]  because that's where the evidence is. The evidence is in these signatures not matching.
[1:00:39.200 --> 1:00:42.720]  The evidence is in these ballots having something weird in them that if they printed
[1:00:42.720 --> 1:00:46.960]  them, the world would see it. The evidence is in these machines not being fairly audited.
[1:00:46.960 --> 1:00:51.440]  The one machine that was audited in Michigan came back with major problems and issues and
[1:00:51.440 --> 1:00:56.480]  questions. Oh, it's incredible. All we found is scams. And Barnes, you'll be on tonight,
[1:00:56.480 --> 1:00:59.920]  correct? You're going to be co-hosting. And you're going to be laying all this out tonight
[1:01:01.120 --> 1:01:05.440]  from all the way through. All right. Thank you so much. Tonight, 7 o'clock central,
[1:01:05.440 --> 1:01:10.320]  band.video, infowars.com and on radio and TV stations everywhere. And people can follow you
[1:01:10.320 --> 1:01:17.920]  at Twitter where? At barnes underscore law or they can go to viva barneslaw.locals.com
[1:01:17.920 --> 1:01:22.160]  to get that particular letter. Absolutely. All right. I look forward to you being on
[1:01:22.160 --> 1:01:25.840]  tonight. We also have to start talking about the future and the fact that it doesn't look like
[1:01:25.840 --> 1:01:29.600]  they're going to successfully put this fraud in. And we're not giving up, folks. We're just being
[1:01:29.600 --> 1:01:34.720]  honest. We told you up front that this is a David versus Goliath thing. And just remember,
[1:01:34.720 --> 1:01:38.720]  you're going to have the same Q people telling you delusions again and have the same folks that
[1:01:38.720 --> 1:01:43.520]  told you, you know, just go to sleep, trust Mitch McConnell, trust the plan. Well, no more like trust
[1:01:43.520 --> 1:01:47.760]  the scam. We have seen what this betrayal has done of wishful thinking. We're going to grow up now.
[1:01:47.760 --> 1:01:51.200]  And I understand that most of the audience never bought it. But for others, it was really sad.
[1:01:51.200 --> 1:01:56.960]  Thank you, Barnes. The globalists have always been at war with the family and small businesses.
[1:01:56.960 --> 1:02:02.560]  They want control. They want domesticated slaves. That's the process that is taking place right now.
[1:02:03.120 --> 1:02:06.640]  And when you shop at the big box stores and when you shop with Amazon,
[1:02:06.640 --> 1:02:11.200]  remember that they are creating monopolies and they are the globalists that are pushing the
[1:02:11.200 --> 1:02:16.240]  lockdowns, gun control, abortion, world government, all of it. If you want to do that, go ahead and
[1:02:16.240 --> 1:02:20.960]  shop there. But if you'll shop at info wars, where we have thousands of products made right here in
[1:02:20.960 --> 1:02:26.320]  America with our warehouses and our crew, it's incredible and it changes the whole world. So
[1:02:26.320 --> 1:02:30.640]  do your shopping. If you want to fund the info or if you want to stop the globalist at info

[1:02:35.680 --> 1:02:40.320]  We can get everything delivered to you by Christmas if you order by the 18th. So again,
[1:02:40.320 --> 1:02:43.760]  I want to thank you all for your support. I want to thank you for thinking through what you do
[1:02:43.760 --> 1:03:01.440]  and where you spend your money and do your shopping and get great products at info wars store.com.
[1:03:14.720 --> 1:03:21.680]  Well, there were a lot of powerful messages at the second million month of March. This one was
[1:03:21.680 --> 1:03:27.520]  about a third as big as the gigantic one. It was a month ago. There were still hundreds of
[1:03:27.520 --> 1:03:32.080]  thousands of people total five or six different events going on. But last time I had the most
[1:03:32.080 --> 1:03:35.360]  powerful message of we're not going to back down to the globalist, the new world order,
[1:03:35.360 --> 1:03:40.720]  Biden's a chai-com agent, Nick Fuentes had the most powerful message at these events.
[1:03:40.720 --> 1:03:45.120]  The crowds were just screaming. He couldn't even hardly give a speech. Five million views here,
[1:03:45.120 --> 1:03:50.800]  three million views there. With all the suppression still, his message is the truth and it's the most
[1:03:50.800 --> 1:03:55.520]  popular message. So we got to get Nick Fuentes on immediately. And there were so many rallies and
[1:03:55.520 --> 1:03:59.680]  so many groups that I missed. I was looking around for him for three days, but it was just
[1:03:59.680 --> 1:04:05.280]  incredible. People would come to my hotel, demand I give a speech. You know, 2,000 people show up.
[1:04:05.280 --> 1:04:12.720]  So there's a lot of excitement there. But this time it was all broken up. I hope folks, regardless
[1:04:12.720 --> 1:04:18.240]  of what happens, go on the 20th of January because we're not accepting Joe Biden. We're declaring,
[1:04:18.240 --> 1:04:23.440]  we know he's a fraud. We're also declaring war on Mitch McConnell. You know, I said Sunday
[1:04:23.440 --> 1:04:27.840]  when I had had a chance to see Saturday speeches by Fuentes on my Sunday show. I said, I think
[1:04:27.840 --> 1:04:34.000]  Fuentes is right. The Republican Party, the establishment are the enemies. But we have
[1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:39.200]  to make sure that doesn't get Democrats elected. We have to make sure we target Neocons and others
[1:04:39.200 --> 1:04:44.400]  to get them out and put populace in America first years in. But now you see McConnell saying, oh,
[1:04:44.400 --> 1:04:48.480]  we need to be nice to the Democrats. It's never going to win Georgia and let them engage in fraud.
[1:04:48.480 --> 1:04:53.760]  He's definitely working for the other side and a CHICOM operative. I want to read his quotes in
[1:04:53.760 --> 1:04:59.040]  a big article in AP. McConnell warned GOP of electoral college brawl in Congress. But first,
[1:04:59.040 --> 1:05:04.640]  here's one of the eclipses of Nick Fuentes laying out the future and the future battle plan
[1:05:04.640 --> 1:05:09.840]  at the second big march in D.C. And the first million MAGA march, we promised
[1:05:09.840 --> 1:05:14.560]  that if the GOP would not do everything in their power to keep Trump in office,
[1:05:14.560 --> 1:05:24.400]  then we would destroy the GOP. And as we gather here in Washington, D.C. for a second million
[1:05:24.400 --> 1:05:31.920]  MAGA march, we're done making promises. It has to happen now. We are going to destroy the GOP.
[1:05:31.920 --> 1:05:41.840]  tinham
[1:05:44.160 --> 1:05:48.060] 夜
[1:05:51.640 --> 1:05:55.900]  for you can find a bunch of the speeches in bits of it at banned on video but
[1:05:55.900 --> 1:06:01.120]  also on Nick point has a site and on top of that on his Twitter Nicholas Jay
[1:06:01.120 --> 1:06:04.640]  point test dot com but but I'm he's with us the rest of the hour and I got him on
[1:06:04.640 --> 1:06:08.320]  here but let me just say one more point this is a parallel or an allegory or
[1:06:08.320 --> 1:06:13.720]  like a gauge on a submarine or battleship or an army tanker a truck you
[1:06:13.720 --> 1:06:16.880]  have these women that are neocons and I'm not going to attack them but the point
[1:06:16.880 --> 1:06:20.480]  is they get all the permits they take control of the thing and then when you
[1:06:20.480 --> 1:06:25.640]  hear the speakers they've got it is just people are falling asleep and then I
[1:06:25.640 --> 1:06:28.640]  show up with a bullhorn Nick shows up you get you know out of the hundred
[1:06:28.640 --> 1:06:31.440]  thousand people twenty thousand that here you run over and they're all
[1:06:31.440 --> 1:06:35.360]  cheering and then it gets five million ten million views and then the poor
[1:06:35.360 --> 1:06:40.040]  Republicans with kind of a mainline Rhino a little Trump is type deal they
[1:06:40.040 --> 1:06:43.800]  get twenty thousand views it's not popular it's not constitutional it's not
[1:06:43.800 --> 1:06:48.920]  what made America but everyone's always running away from what victory is and so
[1:06:48.920 --> 1:06:53.080]  Nick point test thanks for joining us great job there in DC go wherever you
[1:06:53.080 --> 1:06:56.640]  want here but you probably want to elaborate ever folks that didn't get to
[1:06:56.640 --> 1:07:01.080]  hear your full speech on the speech that you gave those speeches you gave
[1:07:01.080 --> 1:07:05.640]  there in DC last weekend well thank you so much for having me and I think it's
[1:07:05.640 --> 1:07:09.640]  a really good point that you make about these marches for the in the first place
[1:07:09.640 --> 1:07:14.400]  you have these big organizers organized the stage and the sound system and like
[1:07:14.400 --> 1:07:17.960]  you said people that are organizing these official type events they're not
[1:07:17.960 --> 1:07:23.640]  really true believers in an America first Trumpian populist message they're
[1:07:23.640 --> 1:07:27.120]  pushing a lot of the same conservative stuff that Mitch McConnell promotes and
[1:07:27.120 --> 1:07:31.200]  the GOP promotes there's no energy behind that but to elaborate a little bit on
[1:07:31.200 --> 1:07:34.000]  the speech you know it's interesting there were a lot of Democrats that were
[1:07:34.000 --> 1:07:37.920]  saying destroy the GOP this is a message I could get behind but of course
[1:07:37.920 --> 1:07:42.040]  that's only the first half of the message destroy the GOP as it exists
[1:07:42.040 --> 1:07:46.280]  destroy the GOP establishment and what we have to do now is replace it with a
[1:07:46.280 --> 1:07:51.640]  GOP that truly represents the American people we have to destroy the fake GOP
[1:07:51.640 --> 1:07:55.760]  establishment headed by Mitch McConnell that puts America last we have to
[1:07:55.760 --> 1:08:00.360]  primary all those people replace them in the House in the Senate and the state
[1:08:00.360 --> 1:08:03.880]  governments and we have to replace them with people that truly believe in
[1:08:03.880 --> 1:08:08.640]  America first truly believe in the kind of conservatism that President Trump
[1:08:08.640 --> 1:08:12.840]  pushed when he ran in 2016 and I think that that is where we take the fight
[1:08:12.840 --> 1:08:16.520]  after this election whether it works out for Donald Trump which I think is
[1:08:16.520 --> 1:08:21.400]  increasingly unlikely whether Joe Biden is inaugurated on January 20th
[1:08:21.400 --> 1:08:25.920]  the directive is the same after the inauguration we have to go out to these
[1:08:25.920 --> 1:08:30.640]  different states look at every senator every House Republican it did not
[1:08:30.640 --> 1:08:34.000]  support the president that did not do everything in their power to keep him in
[1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:39.920]  office and they have to have a real primary challenge in 2022 2024 and 2026
[1:08:39.920 --> 1:08:44.320]  because this has been happening for decades now that we Republicans we the
[1:08:44.320 --> 1:08:49.040]  real base of the party we the real people of the country we vote for
[1:08:49.040 --> 1:08:53.760]  Republicans to do conservative things on the economy on foreign policy on trade
[1:08:53.760 --> 1:08:58.440]  on immigration and time it again they go to Washington DC and they give us
[1:08:58.440 --> 1:09:02.360]  nothing in return and you've seen this for the past couple of weeks alone from
[1:09:02.360 --> 1:09:06.200]  Senate Republicans and House Republicans even as they make the case that we
[1:09:06.200 --> 1:09:10.440]  should give them another two years in in the control of the Senate with the
[1:09:10.440 --> 1:09:14.280]  Senate runoff in Georgia and I am of the belief that we should not do that I'm
[1:09:14.280 --> 1:09:18.400]  of the belief that the first blow that we have to strike against the Republican
[1:09:18.400 --> 1:09:22.680]  Party is withholding our votes in Georgia withholding our votes in the Senate
[1:09:22.680 --> 1:09:25.840]  runoff and preventing them from reclaiming control this that's where I
[1:09:25.840 --> 1:09:30.200]  disagree with you because it's one thing in primaries to beat all these
[1:09:30.200 --> 1:09:35.320]  neocons and rhinos and globals which I'm totally for but I mean there's two
[1:09:35.320 --> 1:09:39.080]  schools of thoughts maybe make it worse faster maybe let folks get a full dose
[1:09:39.080 --> 1:09:43.240]  so that Republicans can't act like you know that they're actually debating what's
[1:09:43.240 --> 1:09:47.320]  going on maybe make it all be about the Democrats just seems like a very dangerous
[1:09:47.320 --> 1:09:52.880]  way to go yeah and I understand that and and I respectfully disagree that's okay
[1:09:52.880 --> 1:09:58.160]  I actually shared the same views on you initially and I said well we're gonna
[1:09:58.160 --> 1:10:01.120]  have to go out and we're gonna have to win the Senate runoff because if the
[1:10:01.120 --> 1:10:04.480]  Democrats get control the Senate the House and the White House we're in for
[1:10:04.480 --> 1:10:08.640]  trouble that's gonna mean amnesty that's gonna mean bad things in the Senate but
[1:10:08.640 --> 1:10:13.680]  then over the past few weeks I saw that Senate Republicans passed the National
[1:10:13.680 --> 1:10:17.920]  Defense Authorization Act without a repeal of section 230 they passed the
[1:10:17.920 --> 1:10:21.320]  warrant amendment in the NDAA and the warrant amendment says that they're
[1:10:21.320 --> 1:10:25.400]  gonna strip away the Confederate names from military bases and additionally
[1:10:25.400 --> 1:10:29.400]  there is a provision in the NDAA which prevents the president from pulling
[1:10:29.400 --> 1:10:32.840]  troops out of Afghanistan in the remaining four months or rather the
[1:10:32.840 --> 1:10:38.600]  remaining four weeks of his first term a bunch of these high-tech visas you're
[1:10:38.600 --> 1:10:43.880]  absolutely right as soon as they thought Trump excuse me was down they showed us
[1:10:43.880 --> 1:10:49.600]  who they were right well and and Senate Republicans like Mitch McConnell are
[1:10:49.600 --> 1:10:54.480]  already saying that they're going to work with Joe Biden in particular David
[1:10:54.480 --> 1:10:58.280]  Perdue and Kelly Leffler they did an interview I think the Friday before that
[1:10:58.280 --> 1:11:03.120]  second big March in Washington DC and they said we are eager and enthusiastic
[1:11:03.120 --> 1:11:07.640]  to work with Joe Biden and that is more or less what the Senate majority why do
[1:11:07.640 --> 1:11:11.080]  they think that's gonna get them elected that looks like a white flag to me
[1:11:11.080 --> 1:11:15.880]  that's how this works exactly and that's sort of what I've been saying I said
[1:11:15.880 --> 1:11:19.520]  that our vote or at least Georgia Republicans vote in the Senate runoff
[1:11:19.520 --> 1:11:23.560]  should be conditional and the condition is if you're going to show us that you
[1:11:23.560 --> 1:11:27.600]  represent us if Perdue and Leffler and if Mitch McConnell show that they're
[1:11:27.600 --> 1:11:30.880]  going to offer resistance to the Biden administration then they can earn our
[1:11:30.880 --> 1:11:34.960]  vote and you're exactly right while they're asking us for our vote to keep
[1:11:34.960 --> 1:11:38.480]  control the Senate at the same time they're waving a white flag and they're
[1:11:38.480 --> 1:11:42.360]  saying already we will work with Biden we'll work with Biden on amnesty we'll
[1:11:42.360 --> 1:11:47.560]  work with Biden on his agenda what kind of pitch is that to reluctant voters
[1:11:47.560 --> 1:11:52.120]  who are thinking about withholding their votes or voters who are very upset with
[1:11:52.120 --> 1:11:55.200]  the Republican Party very upset with their handling of the election fraud
[1:11:55.200 --> 1:12:00.880]  that doesn't sound like a persuasive or winning message to me is when it gets
[1:12:00.880 --> 1:12:04.800]  around to your electronic voting machines and your fraud with me or with my
[1:12:04.800 --> 1:12:08.880]  successor you're gonna put me in I mean that's what these are Republicans
[1:12:08.880 --> 1:12:12.120]  selling out what's left of the party that's been their job the Democrats
[1:12:12.120 --> 1:12:17.480]  admitted is have a one-party state that's right that is exactly the end game
[1:12:17.480 --> 1:12:21.320]  and this is where I think Republicans have to think very carefully about who
[1:12:21.320 --> 1:12:25.000]  are real friends and enemies are you know I hear some people saying we have to
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:28.720]  hold the line for the Republican Party the Republican Party never holds the
[1:12:28.720 --> 1:12:32.720]  line for us the line is not between Republicans and Democrats it's between
[1:12:32.720 --> 1:12:36.880]  us the American people and both parties both parties that represent a
[1:12:36.880 --> 1:12:40.600]  mono party the collective establishment that's in favor of all these
[1:12:40.600 --> 1:12:46.280]  public policy all right Nick Fointess is our guest and that green bean I've got
[1:12:46.280 --> 1:12:49.240]  out of my throat so I'll be able to talk when we come back I was like sneaking a
[1:12:49.240 --> 1:12:53.400]  bite while he was talking we'll be right back stay with us you must guard your
[1:12:53.400 --> 1:12:58.640]  humanity you must guard your children's humanity you must guard the very genetic
[1:12:58.640 --> 1:13:02.520]  code of the planet the globalists have set themselves up as the guardians of
[1:13:02.520 --> 1:13:06.640]  this world but they are the ones that are overriding every genetic system
[1:13:06.640 --> 1:13:11.680]  poisoning the planet they are the ones that are now engaged in genetic takeover
[1:13:11.680 --> 1:13:17.200]  of every human on earth to the GMO crops and now they've moved on to their
[1:13:17.200 --> 1:13:23.120]  main target humanity with the mRNA vaccines which are not vaccines they
[1:13:23.120 --> 1:13:30.360]  are recombinant DNA from aborted cloned fetuses we're then inserted into your
[1:13:30.360 --> 1:13:37.400]  genome to take over your body's systems go read the actual inserts for the mRNA
[1:13:37.400 --> 1:13:42.440]  vaccines and then remember you've been warned this is the equivalent of an
[1:13:42.440 --> 1:13:45.400]  alien takeover whether it's interdimensional whether it's little
[1:13:45.400 --> 1:13:49.080]  green men the globalists are acting like another species that's overtaking us
[1:13:49.080 --> 1:13:53.160]  and overriding us it's all the same in the end it's time to show them what a
[1:13:53.160 --> 1:13:57.000]  real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products ever made

[1:14:55.800 --> 1:15:18.200]  to the alex jones show resistance to tyrants is obedience to god it's alex
[1:15:18.200 --> 1:15:26.080]  jones so I want to tell the great listeners and activists this broadcast something if you want
[1:15:26.080 --> 1:15:31.000]  Trump to override this fraud you've got to support it so five hundred thousand a
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:34.920]  million whatever it was it was huge show up in DC a month ago and then a couple
[1:15:34.920 --> 1:15:39.600]  hundred thousand show up max this time on the 20th it's not about Trump so I
[1:15:39.600 --> 1:15:42.680]  believe it looks like they're gonna be able to steal it at this point unless
[1:15:42.680 --> 1:15:46.080]  there's some magic action by the Justice Department that's so far has done
[1:15:46.080 --> 1:15:50.280]  nothing we had to be there to let Joe Biden and the globalist know we don't
[1:15:50.280 --> 1:15:53.600]  accept you and we're gonna be on your ass with civil disobedience the whole
[1:15:53.600 --> 1:15:59.000]  time and to let the neocons and the rhinos who never did a damn thing about
[1:15:59.000 --> 1:16:02.920]  big tech censorship and allowed this to happen because they're getting money from
[1:16:02.920 --> 1:16:08.320]  them so so Nick break down where you think we should go what you think's gonna
[1:16:08.320 --> 1:16:13.120]  unfold can Trump be saved at this point he really tried to do what he said he
[1:16:13.120 --> 1:16:16.480]  would do and you saw they've come in with fraud to get rid of him I think all
[1:16:16.480 --> 1:16:19.680]  these Republicans too are just scared and they want to be the good little
[1:16:19.680 --> 1:16:24.280]  Republican that's kind of the token of the establishment you're right and
[1:16:24.280 --> 1:16:28.920]  Republicans the ball was in their court after the election we know that Donald
[1:16:28.920 --> 1:16:33.080]  Trump won on November 3rd that is really beyond a question at this point he
[1:16:33.080 --> 1:16:37.160]  won Wisconsin he won Michigan Pennsylvania Georgia he legitimately and
[1:16:37.160 --> 1:16:40.640]  rightfully won the election and when the Democrats began to steal it with mail
[1:16:40.640 --> 1:16:46.040]  and ballots there were many options for the president Trump for president Trump
[1:16:46.040 --> 1:16:51.560]  to take his rightful place with another four years we had control of state
[1:16:51.560 --> 1:16:55.840]  legislatures in those four swing states that I just listed Republicans had
[1:16:55.840 --> 1:17:00.520]  control in Wisconsin Michigan Georgia Pennsylvania and those Republican
[1:17:00.520 --> 1:17:04.200]  controlled state legislatures failed to act they did not exercise their
[1:17:04.200 --> 1:17:07.880]  constitutional authority to appoint their own electors because of the voter
[1:17:07.880 --> 1:17:14.280]  fraud we had a six to three or at least a five to four majority on the Supreme
[1:17:14.280 --> 1:17:18.120]  Court the Supreme Court could have intervened in this election with any
[1:17:18.120 --> 1:17:22.280]  number of cases most recently the Texas suit that was probably the biggest and
[1:17:22.280 --> 1:17:25.880]  strongest case and they failed to intervene and stop the election fraud
[1:17:25.880 --> 1:17:30.240]  so not only did Trump win on election night but the Republican Party had the
[1:17:30.240 --> 1:17:34.000]  chance every step of the way at every level in the state legislatures and the
[1:17:34.000 --> 1:17:38.360]  courts and the Supreme Court to overturn this result and what's more is not
[1:17:38.360 --> 1:17:41.680]  only did they not do that but they didn't even have support from Senate
[1:17:41.680 --> 1:17:46.160]  Republicans House Republicans even Republican representatives that didn't
[1:17:46.160 --> 1:17:50.880]  play a big role in the process they would not even give verbal support or
[1:17:50.880 --> 1:17:55.480]  any kind of support to the effort to overturn these results and I think it's
[1:17:55.480 --> 1:17:59.320]  not because they were scared I think it's because they want Trump to go out of
[1:17:59.320 --> 1:18:02.960]  office just like the Democrats you know it was in the first they want everything
[1:18:02.960 --> 1:18:06.560]  to go back to the lobbyist everything business as usual selling out America
[1:18:06.560 --> 1:18:11.600]  exactly because Republicans are in favor of open borders they're in favor of
[1:18:11.600 --> 1:18:15.600]  globalization they're in favor of these lockdowns which are benefiting big tech
[1:18:15.600 --> 1:18:19.920]  and these giant corporations just like the Democrats and they want Trump to go
[1:18:19.920 --> 1:18:24.080]  for those same reasons it's Mitch McConnell and it was even Paul Ryan in
[1:18:24.080 --> 1:18:27.080]  the first two years of the administration that blocked the border wall
[1:18:27.080 --> 1:18:30.480]  they blocked Trump's plans on infrastructure blocked his plan on
[1:18:30.480 --> 1:18:34.080]  just about everything and I think that they want their cake and they want to
[1:18:34.080 --> 1:18:39.600]  eat it too they wanted Trump's support to get them I think the 27 seats in the
[1:18:39.600 --> 1:18:44.080]  house where they were up for exactly they used him to get that grassroots but
[1:18:44.080 --> 1:18:47.280]  allowed at the targeting theft of him that's what I was gonna say this morning
[1:18:47.280 --> 1:18:51.160]  the way McConnell's operating I don't like to speculate but I do it 1% of the
[1:18:51.160 --> 1:18:56.120]  time is there was an inside deal made to give them control of certain things and
[1:18:56.120 --> 1:19:00.000]  if they play ball and sell America out they'll be left at least in partial
[1:19:00.000 --> 1:19:03.840]  power and I think that's what Mitch McConnell is saying right now that's
[1:19:03.840 --> 1:19:09.080]  that is what he's saying because it was with Donald Trump and only with Donald
[1:19:09.080 --> 1:19:12.920]  Trump's support that Mitch McConnell was able to get 50 seats in the Senate
[1:19:12.920 --> 1:19:17.400]  possibly 52 it was only with the support of Trump that House Republicans were
[1:19:17.400 --> 1:19:21.680]  able to make gains in the House of Representatives and what they wanted to
[1:19:21.680 --> 1:19:25.880]  do was use him so that they could get themselves across the finish line in the
[1:19:25.880 --> 1:19:29.480]  House in the Senate and then like you said the bargain was they're gonna get
[1:19:29.480 --> 1:19:33.120]  their seats in the Congress and then they get to throw out the president they
[1:19:33.120 --> 1:19:36.920]  get his support they get him to deliver seats without actually having to accept
[1:19:36.920 --> 1:19:41.360]  another four years another term for the president the power of the populist
[1:19:41.360 --> 1:19:45.600]  info wars movement did and so the grassroots should know we can continue
[1:19:45.600 --> 1:19:49.160]  to wage war against the globalist whether they be Republican or Democrat I
[1:19:49.160 --> 1:19:53.760]  think that's a really sensible good plan but it all remains to be seen of what's
[1:19:53.760 --> 1:19:58.640]  gonna unfold how much did the Q movement I'm not being mean to Q followers but we
[1:19:58.640 --> 1:20:02.800]  know everything's fine trust the plan everything's gonna be okay kind of
[1:20:02.800 --> 1:20:06.320]  reveling in the power of we're victorious they're all secretly in these
[1:20:06.320 --> 1:20:10.400]  FEMA camps everyone's gone to president general Flynn is still out there saying
[1:20:10.400 --> 1:20:14.760]  100% chance Trump's gonna win that's what keeps people from hitting the
[1:20:14.760 --> 1:20:19.920]  streets and Trump winning it's just it's delusional yeah it's problematic
[1:20:19.920 --> 1:20:24.880]  because it is creating complicity in the Republican Party and I have to say
[1:20:24.880 --> 1:20:28.920]  what I like about the Q and on stuff is that it gets a lot of people to
[1:20:28.920 --> 1:20:32.200]  believe the right things although it gets them to believe the right things
[1:20:32.200 --> 1:20:35.560]  for the wrong reasons it gets them to start thinking about connections
[1:20:35.560 --> 1:20:39.160]  between global special interests it gets them to ask the right questions about
[1:20:39.160 --> 1:20:43.520]  pedophiles and satanic elites and things like that largely for the wrong reasons
[1:20:43.520 --> 1:20:46.920]  but it does get them to some of the right places the biggest problem though
[1:20:46.920 --> 1:20:51.400]  with it like you said is that it makes Republicans complicit people think that
[1:20:51.400 --> 1:20:55.520]  there's this big plan in the works that Trump is gonna stay office it's only a
[1:20:55.520 --> 1:20:59.360]  matter of time Patriots in control this kind of stuff and you know I could tell
[1:20:59.360 --> 1:21:03.320]  you a certainty that this is not the case there's tremendous incompetence in
[1:21:03.320 --> 1:21:07.240]  the White House there's tremendous incompetence in the campaign and I love
[1:21:07.240 --> 1:21:11.120]  Donald Trump I'm loyal to him I support him completely but the people that he is
[1:21:11.120 --> 1:21:14.040]  surrounded himself with in the campaign in the White House in the
[1:21:14.040 --> 1:21:19.040]  administration they're either actively sabotaging him all the time or they are
[1:21:19.040 --> 1:21:24.720]  largely incompetent that's the paradox that's the paradox is he was an
[1:21:24.720 --> 1:21:28.360]  outsider he didn't bring in lobbyist but then he didn't know who to hire
[1:21:28.360 --> 1:21:31.600]  politically so they were able to basically block him in much of his
[1:21:31.600 --> 1:21:36.680]  agenda but he still got a lot done right it was in spite of sabotage by the
[1:21:36.680 --> 1:21:39.960]  globalists inside and outside the administration that he was one of the
[1:21:39.960 --> 1:21:43.240]  most successful presidents I think in modern American history I mean he built
[1:21:43.240 --> 1:21:46.880]  more than 400 miles of border wall did not get us involved in a bunch of wars
[1:21:46.880 --> 1:21:50.080]  got a bunch of peace treaties got a bunch of businesses and industry back to
[1:21:50.080 --> 1:21:55.080]  the United States I mean you talk about Trump got a lot done yeah trade deals I
[1:21:55.080 --> 1:21:58.560]  mean he did it was a very successful first term and that was in spite of a
[1:21:58.560 --> 1:22:02.680]  lot of bad personnel and resistance inside and outside and he stood up to
[1:22:02.680 --> 1:22:06.280]  America sucks attacks and stood up to all these I mean he did a great job and
[1:22:06.280 --> 1:22:10.200]  I'm not saying he's 100% gone folks but it's like the Sun setting and we're
[1:22:10.200 --> 1:22:14.000]  seeing the last glimmers of light here how demoralized you think people are
[1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:18.000]  gonna get that have been delusional even when Joe Biden gets inaugurated in
[1:22:18.000 --> 1:22:22.320]  35 days well you know I'm gonna be honest with you it's definitely gonna hurt
[1:22:22.320 --> 1:22:27.080]  it's gonna hurt me a lot especially and what's so frustrating is because we
[1:22:27.080 --> 1:22:30.160]  pulled off the impossible the president one with more votes than any other
[1:22:30.160 --> 1:22:34.320]  president in history he got 10 million more votes than four years ago and it
[1:22:34.320 --> 1:22:37.760]  was stolen from us there was no reason that it should have been stolen from us
[1:22:37.760 --> 1:22:41.560]  and yet it was we were screwed by the Republicans that being said as much as
[1:22:41.560 --> 1:22:46.240]  it hurts me to see all of this funny business go on I have to say I actually
[1:22:46.240 --> 1:22:52.120]  feel energized because the path is clear from here Trump has energized the
[1:22:52.120 --> 1:22:56.680]  country he's woken up the base and now the real battle will occur it will
[1:22:56.680 --> 1:23:01.440]  commence over the Republican Party Trump started the fire and now we have to
[1:23:01.440 --> 1:23:05.680]  carry it forward by replacing people at every level in the party you know Trump
[1:23:05.680 --> 1:23:09.120]  launched this hostile takeover of the top of the party I mean literally
[1:23:09.120 --> 1:23:13.120]  becoming the president and now we have to wage a war for everything beneath the
[1:23:13.120 --> 1:23:17.040]  presidency we have to wage a war to primary House Republicans Senate
[1:23:17.040 --> 1:23:21.480]  Republicans we have to run in state races and local races we have to take
[1:23:21.480 --> 1:23:27.080]  over the RNC and the party apparatus so I heard it better said that was
[1:23:27.080 --> 1:23:31.080]  perfectly said so we're gonna come back and talk about that talk about the
[1:23:31.080 --> 1:23:34.400]  second lockdowns how to counter the globalist where you see that going with
[1:23:34.400 --> 1:23:38.920]  Nick point as I'm Alex Jones with info wars calm check him out at Nicholas J

[1:24:15.440 --> 1:24:18.560]  giant awakening happening that's what the globalists have gone ahead and

[1:26:49.080 --> 1:26:51.640]  calm
[1:26:51.640 --> 1:27:13.480]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show there are a lot of people out there
[1:27:13.480 --> 1:27:17.520]  claiming politics works a lot of people that have their own flavor their own
[1:27:17.520 --> 1:27:21.120]  philosophy their own idea while there's 10,000 different denominations of
[1:27:21.120 --> 1:27:24.680]  churches in the US alone in the whole world they estimate over a hundred
[1:27:24.680 --> 1:27:28.400]  thousand that's just the Christian Church because everybody's got to have
[1:27:28.400 --> 1:27:32.040]  their own worldview their own little idea to be different than somebody else or
[1:27:32.040 --> 1:27:36.880]  as I study what the top corporations the chai comms the globalist want and I
[1:27:36.880 --> 1:27:40.920]  know exactly their plan and guess what they're pretty much in control of the
[1:27:40.920 --> 1:27:45.320]  planet and are incrementally taking us towards some really bad places but like
[1:27:45.320 --> 1:27:50.080]  on a roller coaster you wait in line for a couple hours or 30 minutes or whatever
[1:27:50.080 --> 1:27:57.520]  eat your chili dog drink your Coca-Cola you finally get on it but as soon as you
[1:27:57.520 --> 1:28:02.520]  start going over the edge it's really fast well we're in that moment of now
[1:28:02.520 --> 1:28:06.920]  going over and now we're speeding up and now the ride is beginning and it's not
[1:28:06.920 --> 1:28:10.520]  going to be a very fun ride but if you decide to go along with the system it's
[1:28:10.520 --> 1:28:16.640]  going to be a lot worse and so what Nick point has was just saying and again this
[1:28:16.640 --> 1:28:19.720]  is Alex Jones show thanks for tuning in is absolutely true I feel energized
[1:28:19.720 --> 1:28:23.920]  because I was talking to Trump lawyers and I'm not trying to name drop you know
[1:28:23.920 --> 1:28:30.040]  I saw this Bartiramo lady at Fox whether he's a sweetheart I watched her on
[1:28:30.040 --> 1:28:36.040]  CNBC for years and she means well she goes I talked to an Intel officer and
[1:28:36.040 --> 1:28:40.080]  he said Trump really won it's like there's magical Intel officers off on
[1:28:40.080 --> 1:28:43.600]  some mountaintop that know everything they just know what we know and maybe
[1:28:43.600 --> 1:28:47.200]  have some inside baseball on some other things and a lot of high-level sources
[1:28:47.200 --> 1:28:50.000]  that have their perspective but it doesn't mean they're God of course Trump
[1:28:50.000 --> 1:28:53.560]  really won the election we have all the evidence but see it's that magic thing
[1:28:53.560 --> 1:28:58.560]  of oh an Intel person told me we'll play the clip in a moment it has to be you
[1:28:58.560 --> 1:29:03.400]  that knows it has to be you that's involved you that's engaged and so again
[1:29:03.400 --> 1:29:07.080]  globalism wasn't even known or understood 20 years ago 10 years ago now
[1:29:07.080 --> 1:29:10.280]  it's public enemy number one Soros is getting run out of the whole world
[1:29:10.280 --> 1:29:14.000]  Bill Gates is being run out this whole COVID lockdown this world government
[1:29:14.000 --> 1:29:19.600]  move is their desperate act to maintain control so as bad as it looks you don't
[1:29:19.600 --> 1:29:24.080]  give into it you say no and resist it we can have great victory over it and so
[1:29:24.080 --> 1:29:28.280]  I'm sitting there in Georgia I'm sitting there in DC I'm sitting there knowing
[1:29:28.280 --> 1:29:32.240]  it's an uphill battle seeing folks that believe a hundred percent Trump's can
[1:29:32.240 --> 1:29:35.280]  be able to get out of this and but the Democrats already sold us out the
[1:29:35.280 --> 1:29:38.360]  Republicans already sold us out they already had the whole scam set up it's
[1:29:38.360 --> 1:29:42.840]  being aware of that they're all in a league together is the only shot at
[1:29:42.840 --> 1:29:47.000]  beating them for Trump right now and I think he's still got a chance if he uses
[1:29:47.000 --> 1:29:50.480]  his bully pulpit to come out and savage the daylights out of the Bidens for
[1:29:50.480 --> 1:29:54.200]  being Chinese agents to go out with a whole new world order that he classified
[1:29:54.200 --> 1:29:59.360]  to to release assange and to really get aggressive it would call and to call out
[1:29:59.360 --> 1:30:03.600]  10 million people to come down to DC but but if he just hopes on the lawyers
[1:30:03.600 --> 1:30:08.000]  and hopes on the electoral college he's not calling out his political will he's
[1:30:08.000 --> 1:30:12.480]  not getting us to take the field and he will be removed in 35 days if he doesn't
[1:30:12.480 --> 1:30:17.160]  do that Nick Jay Foyntes do you agree with that I absolutely agree he has to
[1:30:17.160 --> 1:30:21.840]  change the dynamic of the situation and you brought up the pardon of Assange he
[1:30:21.840 --> 1:30:25.320]  has to pardon Assange he should pardon Snowden he should pardon Martin Shkreli
[1:30:25.320 --> 1:30:30.440]  he should declassify things from the military from the CIA because what he's
[1:30:30.440 --> 1:30:34.240]  up against like you said is the system that controls the world it is big tech
[1:30:34.240 --> 1:30:38.040]  it is these giant corporations it's the deep state it's the intelligence
[1:30:38.040 --> 1:30:42.120]  community and we have to prepare ourselves for what we're getting into
[1:30:42.120 --> 1:30:46.400]  which is a total war against that regime against this American-led system that
[1:30:46.400 --> 1:30:50.400]  controls the world what Trump should use in the remaining 35 days is the
[1:30:50.400 --> 1:30:54.320]  bully pulpit his powers as president and he should do everything that he can
[1:30:54.320 --> 1:30:59.440]  until January 20th you know until that first term expires to make the systems
[1:30:59.440 --> 1:31:03.640]  life a living hell he has to put that information out there and give us tools
[1:31:03.640 --> 1:31:07.720]  so we can fight because you know once Trump leaves office we don't go away
[1:31:07.720 --> 1:31:12.000]  it's not like we disappear they screwed us out of an election but we'll still be
[1:31:12.000 --> 1:31:15.520]  alive and we'll still be fighting the president should use those tools to make
[1:31:15.520 --> 1:31:19.600]  it easier for us to delegitimize and attack the system and I think that's
[1:31:19.600 --> 1:31:23.120]  what he's got to do now if this is going to be the last 30 days if this is
[1:31:23.120 --> 1:31:27.040]  going to be the last you know the last days of his administration then he's
[1:31:27.040 --> 1:31:30.240]  got to make it hurt for them while he's still in the Oval Office and there's a
[1:31:30.240 --> 1:31:34.520]  lot of ways and he could still do that you know the executive branch doesn't
[1:31:34.520 --> 1:31:38.280]  have much compared to Congress or the courts and how they sabotaged him for
[1:31:38.280 --> 1:31:42.560]  the past four years but there is a lot of stuff in his arsenal that he could
[1:31:42.560 --> 1:31:46.320]  still use and that's what he's got to do because the fight doesn't end with the
[1:31:46.320 --> 1:31:49.920]  end of this first term and a lot of ways the fight is really only just beginning
[1:31:49.920 --> 1:31:53.400]  and there's one way where you could look at this first term and say that this was
[1:31:53.400 --> 1:31:58.920]  the opening salvo this was the necessary first step in a real war against
[1:31:58.920 --> 1:32:03.680]  the establishment to create a party the Republican Party that can really
[1:32:03.680 --> 1:32:09.000]  represent the American people you know before Trump you had two parties both
[1:32:09.000 --> 1:32:13.120]  controlled by globalists both controlled by the establishment and there was no
[1:32:13.120 --> 1:32:16.720]  shaking their control over the system it was going to be Republicans and
[1:32:16.720 --> 1:32:20.520]  Democrats until the end of time increasingly only Democrats and there
[1:32:20.520 --> 1:32:24.800]  was no seat at the table for the American people what Trump did in 2016 his
[1:32:24.800 --> 1:32:29.720]  hostile takeover of the GOP opened the door for the people to gain control over
[1:32:29.720 --> 1:32:34.560]  one of these parties and wheeled it inside the system in order to affect real
[1:32:34.560 --> 1:32:38.000]  change you know maybe the Trump administration was the necessary
[1:32:38.000 --> 1:32:41.840]  precondition to something within the decade or in the next decade where we
[1:32:41.840 --> 1:32:46.520]  get a truly populist White House a truly populist Senate a truly populist
[1:32:46.520 --> 1:32:50.640]  House of Representatives something like we haven't seen since World War two or
[1:32:50.640 --> 1:32:55.040]  before so that's right it's not history works in fact this was a giant
[1:32:55.040 --> 1:32:58.960]  precursor and I get what people thought oh we've had total victory everything's
[1:32:58.960 --> 1:33:02.440]  fine no the arrogant globalists we sucker punched them with Trump they
[1:33:02.440 --> 1:33:07.440]  totally mobilized and barely were able to you know to steal this maybe not
[1:33:07.440 --> 1:33:11.200]  even still and so I'm not trying to people a pep talk I want folks to
[1:33:11.200 --> 1:33:15.360]  understand what you're saying is true we have come light years back from where
[1:33:15.360 --> 1:33:19.400]  we were there's such an understanding now and if we understand that this is
[1:33:19.400 --> 1:33:23.120]  bigger than Trump it's bigger than all of us individually it's an awakening then
[1:33:23.120 --> 1:33:27.240]  we understand that as you said we're actually in a very good footing right
[1:33:27.240 --> 1:33:32.560]  74 million Trump supporters voted in this election they almost couldn't even
[1:33:32.560 --> 1:33:37.560]  steal it I mean they had to rig the election in six swing states think
[1:33:37.560 --> 1:33:41.600]  about the scope and scale of the fraud not just even with the ballot fraud but
[1:33:41.600 --> 1:33:45.480]  even think about big tech how they conspired on Facebook and Twitter and
[1:33:45.480 --> 1:33:49.640]  YouTube and Google to shut down conservative voices for years and then
[1:33:49.640 --> 1:33:53.520]  issue all these new rules and new regulations in the weeks before the
[1:33:53.520 --> 1:33:57.440]  election think about how the mainstream media and Fox News had to go mask off
[1:33:57.440 --> 1:34:01.840]  and suppress the Trump press conferences suppress the press conferences and the
[1:34:01.840 --> 1:34:05.680]  hearings about the voter fraud this was a massive effort and like you said to
[1:34:05.680 --> 1:34:10.440]  just barely put themselves over the top and nobody even believes it 85% of the
[1:34:10.440 --> 1:34:15.560]  Republican Party says that Joe Biden is not the legitimate president 75% of the
[1:34:15.560 --> 1:34:19.280]  Republican Party said that they believe the election was stolen 74 million
[1:34:19.280 --> 1:34:24.440]  people voted for Trump we've built an army of people that are awake an army of
[1:34:24.440 --> 1:34:28.000]  people that are not rhinos an army of people that are not on board with the
[1:34:28.000 --> 1:34:32.080]  Republican establishment the media has been discredited people see what's going
[1:34:32.080 --> 1:34:36.360]  on we've created a small army which is fully something like a third of the
[1:34:36.360 --> 1:34:40.960]  country now the question is mobilizing those people creating the infrastructure
[1:34:40.960 --> 1:34:45.680]  creating that vehicle that is going to take this massive amount to be the
[1:34:45.680 --> 1:34:49.040]  rebel he needs to continue to be a major leader in the middle of that and
[1:34:49.040 --> 1:34:53.680]  may even be stronger now as an underdog rebel outside but let's expand on that I
[1:34:53.680 --> 1:34:58.920]  like him this to a football game a sudden death football game in in overtime
[1:34:58.920 --> 1:35:03.960]  and we're about to score the final touchdown and then they load a corpse
[1:35:03.960 --> 1:35:06.520]  and I'm not saying I'm threatening Joe Biden I mean he really looks like corpse
[1:35:06.520 --> 1:35:13.160]  into a cannon and fire it from the one yard line over the other hundreds yard
[1:35:13.160 --> 1:35:17.320]  line and say oh look we just won the game I mean everybody knows he's a fraud
[1:35:17.320 --> 1:35:20.720]  everybody knows no one comes with events everybody knows he didn't get more
[1:35:20.720 --> 1:35:25.000]  votes than Obama and so it's really a Pirate victory this is a ridiculous
[1:35:25.000 --> 1:35:30.000]  embarrassment to them he's literally falling apart on TV in front of us yeah
[1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:34.400]  Pirate victory is exactly the right way to describe it yes they may have pulled
[1:35:34.400 --> 1:35:38.360]  off this election steal but what cost because if you think about it this may
[1:35:38.360 --> 1:35:42.040]  have actually been the best outcome in a sense because what this did is it
[1:35:42.040 --> 1:35:47.040]  delegitimize the system in the minds of half the country everybody that voted
[1:35:47.040 --> 1:35:50.960]  for Trump for the most part believes this election was stolen so sure you
[1:35:50.960 --> 1:35:55.080]  could have the White House and you know you could have your Pirate victory you
[1:35:55.080 --> 1:36:00.560]  stole in the election but what was the cost well in the minds of 85% of those
[1:36:00.560 --> 1:36:04.680]  74 million people that voted for Donald Trump they no longer believe that their
[1:36:04.680 --> 1:36:08.360]  votes count they no longer believe that the media is telling the truth they no
[1:36:08.360 --> 1:36:11.800]  longer believe that this system represents them and the question is what
[1:36:11.800 --> 1:36:17.920]  all the consequences of that be in 2022 and 2024 and 26 in a way it might have
[1:36:17.920 --> 1:36:22.600]  actually have been better if they let Trump win this election let him sunset
[1:36:22.600 --> 1:36:27.120]  constitutionally in 24 and then revert to the status quo then without people
[1:36:27.120 --> 1:36:30.800]  losing faith and instead if you look at Jackson who they stole an election from
[1:36:30.800 --> 1:36:34.360]  four years later he came back got an even bigger nick point as final segment
[1:36:34.360 --> 1:36:38.200]  with him straight ahead then the former CEO of Overstock is blowing the whistle
[1:36:38.200 --> 1:36:42.120]  in Hillary Clinton in huge ways claims you as part of the FBI sting against her

[1:37:53.160 --> 1:37:57.480]  dictionaries have similar ones terrorism is the threat of force or
[1:37:57.480 --> 1:38:03.120]  actually carrying out force for a political or financial reason it's
[1:38:03.120 --> 1:38:07.080]  basically scaring the hell out of people until you submit to them that's
[1:38:07.080 --> 1:38:11.440]  exactly what all this overblown COVID-19 garbage is you see the headlines from
[1:38:11.440 --> 1:38:15.680]  CNN ABC News doctors say it's worse than they ever thought COVID more
[1:38:15.680 --> 1:38:20.160]  devastating than you'd ever imagine they told us that two and a half million
[1:38:20.160 --> 1:38:25.280]  people would be dead just eight months ago within three months okay it's a
[1:38:25.280 --> 1:38:29.720]  quarter million if you count all of the people that died of other things we're
[1:38:29.720 --> 1:38:34.120]  talking 96% at co-morbidity these are real numbers these are real facts this
[1:38:34.120 --> 1:38:38.200]  is the chicken little event we all run our houses never come out and are taught
[1:38:38.200 --> 1:38:41.440]  we're not essential all the big box tours in Amazon take over the planet
[1:38:41.440 --> 1:38:46.920]  you could stand up against it this is slavery it is not something you can put

[1:38:54.040 --> 1:38:58.960]  listener first-time caller look in January 2016 I went in a hospital I
[1:38:58.960 --> 1:39:03.200]  went to VA hospital out here in Boyce and I was in there until June and I kept
[1:39:03.200 --> 1:39:06.640]  here in Dr. Group and all you guys talking about living defense let me
[1:39:06.640 --> 1:39:11.640]  case that man I had an internal digestive problem and something with it for
[1:39:11.640 --> 1:39:15.760]  about five or six years and the doctors they tried every test nobody could
[1:39:15.760 --> 1:39:19.400]  figure out what it is and then every day when I kept hearing you and Dr. Group
[1:39:19.400 --> 1:39:22.240]  and those commercials I said you know what I'm gonna get me some of that
[1:39:22.240 --> 1:39:25.160]  freaking living defense now I wasn't supposed to have any nutritional because

[1:39:42.200 --> 1:39:46.920]  bottles of that living defense it's true folks we don't sell anything unless
[1:39:46.920 --> 1:39:49.840]  it's the highest quality and living defense is over the top good
[1:39:49.840 --> 1:39:54.760]  globalists are taking control of the entire human genome they are forcing
[1:39:54.760 --> 1:40:00.960]  mutations this is forced evolution or de-evolution when you look at all the
[1:40:00.960 --> 1:40:04.520]  major research all the major programs are carrying out they are not to produce
[1:40:04.520 --> 1:40:09.640]  people that are smarter or folks that live longer or more oral no it's turning
[1:40:09.640 --> 1:40:13.720]  humanity into a commodity now we see some propaganda like communist China
[1:40:13.720 --> 1:40:20.360]  bragging hey we've done mRNA vaccines to make our soldiers superman that's a way to make it sexy
[1:40:20.360 --> 1:40:24.200]  that hey we're experimenting on our troops we'll send things with that into
[1:40:24.200 --> 1:40:28.280]  our troops and thousands and thousands of died each time they tried a new
[1:40:28.280 --> 1:40:32.000]  experimental vaccine I've talked to high-level folks inside the federal
[1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:35.280]  government and the state of Texas health department they say Alex you know it
[1:40:35.280 --> 1:40:39.400]  hurts a lot of people but for a greater good but that's not even true and it
[1:40:39.400 --> 1:40:43.480]  violates the Geneva Convention the Nuremberg code federal state law this
[1:40:43.480 --> 1:40:50.920]  is violence being carried out against us we have a right to resist it
[1:40:50.920 --> 1:41:15.440]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:41:15.440 --> 1:41:20.280]  I know there's an audience of amazing listeners listening to us on AM and FM radio
[1:41:20.280 --> 1:41:24.480]  stations watching us on UHF and VHF across the country and at infowars.com
[1:41:24.480 --> 1:41:29.760]  and Bandai video you know where we are you know we're still on air but I go to
[1:41:29.760 --> 1:41:32.760]  these big events and shake thousands of hands you I used to love watching you on
[1:41:32.760 --> 1:41:35.920]  YouTube I used to love seeing on Facebook and I'm like we're still in
[1:41:35.920 --> 1:41:40.360]  infowars.com we're still at Bandai video we've upgraded it it all works really
[1:41:40.360 --> 1:41:43.520]  good we spent millions of millions of dollars with our own infrastructure
[1:41:43.520 --> 1:41:48.280]  before the band came because we knew it was coming and and so we're still on
[1:41:48.280 --> 1:41:51.920]  air so it's so important for the audience to realize and I know this seems
[1:41:51.920 --> 1:41:55.720]  simple but I have to remember it too that the general public is looking for the
[1:41:55.720 --> 1:42:00.280]  truth but they don't find it unless you send them there so please this Christmas
[1:42:00.280 --> 1:42:04.000]  tell your friends your family your neighbors tune into the forbidden
[1:42:04.000 --> 1:42:08.000]  information find it and when they find out it's powerful and informative share
[1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:12.720]  it Bandai video go to the band video section of Bandai video so the medical
[1:42:12.720 --> 1:42:17.520]  doctors and scientists that are being silenced that are being shut up it's so
[1:42:17.520 --> 1:42:22.400]  important speaking of that Nick Fuentes has his own website it's excellent he's
[1:42:22.400 --> 1:42:27.040]  got his own work but where is it where's the best place for people to find your
[1:42:27.040 --> 1:42:33.360]  nightly show your daily shows you do you watch my show at D live TV slash Nick
[1:42:33.360 --> 1:42:37.600]  J. Fuentes and I'm on the air Monday through Friday at 8 o'clock central
[1:42:37.600 --> 1:42:42.280]  time and again for folks driving along the right team wheelers or people in
[1:42:42.280 --> 1:42:45.480]  their cars or people walking around outside listening while they're jogging
[1:42:45.480 --> 1:42:50.920]  tell them one more time where they find you it's D live dot TV slash Nick J.
[1:42:50.920 --> 1:42:56.000]  Fuentes because one of my biggest frustrations is we got videos every day
[1:42:56.000 --> 1:42:59.160]  they get millions of views that go out on Twitter go on on Facebook you know get
[1:42:59.160 --> 1:43:02.760]  around the sensors but it's never the really hardcore stuff that I really need
[1:43:02.760 --> 1:43:06.360]  folks to hear they've got to come to the source to really get the full width and
[1:43:06.360 --> 1:43:09.960]  breadth of what's saying or they can edit the tape like they did with you and
[1:43:09.960 --> 1:43:14.300]  go oh Fuentes wants to destroy the Republicans no you mean destroy the bad
[1:43:14.300 --> 1:43:18.920]  Republicans take it over right well and that's exactly what they do they get the
[1:43:18.920 --> 1:43:23.800]  10-20 second cliff and because they control social media they control the
[1:43:23.800 --> 1:43:27.680]  networks they get all of the engagement so they basically get to create their
[1:43:27.680 --> 1:43:32.240]  own reality but but that's right it's not destroyed the GOP as in we're going
[1:43:32.240 --> 1:43:36.600]  to self sabotage and blow up our own institutions it's that we have to wage
[1:43:36.600 --> 1:43:41.280]  a major attack a major assault on the establishment of the party and you could
[1:43:41.280 --> 1:43:45.320]  see why based on what they've been up to in the past few weeks which is to say
[1:43:45.320 --> 1:43:48.880]  they're not supporting our president and they are supporting globalist policies
[1:43:48.880 --> 1:43:55.360]  even as they continue to ask for our votes in closing I've been asking the
[1:43:55.360 --> 1:43:59.520]  question to last 40 minutes 45 minutes what else is on your radar your view on
[1:43:59.520 --> 1:44:04.680]  the COVID lockdowns all this rollout of tearing well I talked about this on my
[1:44:04.680 --> 1:44:09.360]  show last night what I think people have to begin to prepare to do not only is
[1:44:09.360 --> 1:44:14.040]  primary Republicans not only to show up to DC on January 20th and you know to
[1:44:14.040 --> 1:44:18.160]  engage the GOP in elections in the coming years but it's also to be on the
[1:44:18.160 --> 1:44:21.560]  lookout for this vaccine and I know that this is kind of your wheelhouse
[1:44:21.560 --> 1:44:25.360]  you've been talking about this stuff for a long long time and you said earlier
[1:44:25.360 --> 1:44:28.800]  about the roller coaster and how things begin to move very quickly we're
[1:44:28.800 --> 1:44:33.680]  reaching that that peak I think that is going to commence probably this year and
[1:44:33.680 --> 1:44:38.160]  that's going to be the distribution of this COVID vaccine it's this what do
[1:44:38.160 --> 1:44:42.840]  they call it MRNA modification that they're doing I think that what you're
[1:44:42.840 --> 1:44:46.120]  going to see in the next year that people really need to think about is a
[1:44:46.120 --> 1:44:50.840]  mandatory vaccine distribution they're going to mandate that everybody has it
[1:44:50.840 --> 1:44:54.480]  and some people think to themselves well I simply won't get it what they're
[1:44:54.480 --> 1:44:58.000]  going to do is they're going to tell you you can't fly in an airplane you can't
[1:44:58.000 --> 1:45:01.080]  take an Uber you can't eat at a restaurant you can't go to a concert you
[1:45:01.080 --> 1:45:04.840]  can't go to school you can't go to work unless you get your vaccine unless you
[1:45:04.840 --> 1:45:09.440]  get your immunity passport your vaccine passport and what are people going to do
[1:45:09.440 --> 1:45:13.240]  you know most people are not in this situation of you and I where they you
[1:45:13.240 --> 1:45:16.960]  know we don't have employers in the same way most people got to go to work to
[1:45:16.960 --> 1:45:20.680]  eat most people need to travel people need to send their kids to school they
[1:45:20.680 --> 1:45:24.440]  don't really have an option to say I won't get the vaccine and be ostracized
[1:45:24.440 --> 1:45:28.320]  by the society so the answer is notice how they do it in thousands of articles
[1:45:28.320 --> 1:45:31.960]  a day you're gonna have to have it to have a job leave your house get on a
[1:45:31.960 --> 1:45:35.600]  roller coaster you know go to a theme park go to a concert get on an airplane
[1:45:35.600 --> 1:45:38.840]  and then they go oh no no we're not gonna do that it's unconstitutional plus
[1:45:38.840 --> 1:45:41.680]  some people have bad reactions and well and they're like no no we are gonna do
[1:45:41.680 --> 1:45:45.760]  it so they're just conditioning us to get ready for it and to accept that it's
[1:45:45.760 --> 1:45:51.080]  super dangerous well and exactly they used to say when the lockdown first
[1:45:51.080 --> 1:45:54.320]  started they said well we're not gonna enforce these fines we won't enforce
[1:45:54.320 --> 1:45:58.240]  these mask mandates we won't enforce these things that was back in March now
[1:45:58.240 --> 1:46:01.840]  it's December I got kicked off of an airplane just a week ago because I
[1:46:01.840 --> 1:46:06.760]  didn't have my mask covering my nose in some cases they will literally turn the
[1:46:06.760 --> 1:46:10.800]  plane around while it's in the air and land it put it on the ground to kick
[1:46:10.800 --> 1:46:14.000]  somebody off if they're not wearing a mask and then they put them on a no fly
[1:46:14.000 --> 1:46:18.560]  list so people thought eight nine months ago that this kind of stuff was
[1:46:18.560 --> 1:46:22.400]  impossible that that was fear mongering your paranoid if you thought that look
[1:46:22.400 --> 1:46:26.440]  at how far we've come businesses shut down mask mandates you know it's it's
[1:46:26.440 --> 1:46:29.520]  like a different country and I think what you're gonna see in the next year is
[1:46:29.520 --> 1:46:33.600]  that will only increase under Biden only increase under the Democrats and the
[1:46:33.600 --> 1:46:36.960]  consequences will be far more severe you know you wear a mask and the worst
[1:46:36.960 --> 1:46:40.280]  thing that'll happen to you is maybe you get a little hypoxia you don't get as
[1:46:40.280 --> 1:46:45.560]  much oxygen in your system you get the vaccine and God knows what's in it you're
[1:46:45.560 --> 1:46:49.600]  gonna be dealing with maybe bells palsy maybe you're gonna get HIV I saw there
[1:46:49.600 --> 1:46:53.760]  was one trial in Australia where somebody contracted HIV from the vaccine
[1:46:53.760 --> 1:46:58.400]  you know they said from Pfizer that Pfizer executives will not take the
[1:46:58.400 --> 1:47:02.520]  vaccine first because according to them they don't want to cut in line so the
[1:47:02.520 --> 1:47:06.400]  people that manufacture the vaccine and design the vaccine and sell the vaccine
[1:47:06.400 --> 1:47:10.800]  won't take it that should tell you something maybe about the risks involved
[1:47:10.800 --> 1:47:15.480]  in taking the vaccine they say oh it's not ten years ago that in China and in
[1:47:15.480 --> 1:47:19.680]  Germany and in the UK quote elite military and government leaders and
[1:47:19.680 --> 1:47:23.880]  rich people have access to quote clean vaccines so they're putting Trojan
[1:47:23.880 --> 1:47:28.080]  horses in they've been caught secret experimentation the mRNA vaccine they
[1:47:28.080 --> 1:47:31.040]  admit doesn't even help you it but they're just saying we're testing it on you
[1:47:31.040 --> 1:47:36.360]  it goes in and reprograms your cells and now top scientists that have the EU board
[1:47:36.360 --> 1:47:42.320]  said the only other vaccine we found like this is for sterilizing animals by
[1:47:42.320 --> 1:47:46.560]  attacking their placenta so the same protein that this mRNA vaccine
[1:47:46.560 --> 1:47:52.120]  Pfizer's in Europe goes after attacks the placenta and mammals now guess who
[1:47:52.120 --> 1:47:56.800]  told us that the former chief science officer of Pfizer wrote the paper with
[1:47:56.800 --> 1:48:02.000]  Wolfgang Wuddard the head of the EU Commission the advisory Commission so
[1:48:02.000 --> 1:48:08.280]  it's like they're Fauci coming out saying this then the top French pharma
[1:48:08.280 --> 1:48:11.360]  professor he's the top guy in the country he came out and said it's all a
[1:48:11.360 --> 1:48:15.240]  dangerous scam and meant to take over they put him in a mental institution
[1:48:15.240 --> 1:48:20.560]  yesterday brother I mean this is real authoritarianism it's no surprise it's
[1:48:20.560 --> 1:48:23.920]  no surprise this is what they've been planning to do for years and they've
[1:48:23.920 --> 1:48:28.160]  been going after the so-called anti-vaxxers for years they've been
[1:48:28.160 --> 1:48:31.240]  saying that if you're against vaccines you're anti-science you're a danger to
[1:48:31.240 --> 1:48:34.200]  public health you're pushing misinformation and you should be banned
[1:48:34.200 --> 1:48:38.880]  from Facebook and Twitter it was all to prepare for this exact scenario and I
[1:48:38.880 --> 1:48:43.680]  said this on my show last night this entire situation is gonna make 9-11
[1:48:43.680 --> 1:48:47.360]  look like a jail and what I mean by that is what you have with the government is
[1:48:47.360 --> 1:48:52.200]  they manufacture a crisis and then they manufacture a horrible response which is
[1:48:52.200 --> 1:48:55.880]  worse than the crisis they have 9-11 and then they have the Patriot Act the
[1:48:55.880 --> 1:49:00.680]  war on terror DHS mass surveillance in the wake of COVID you're gonna see a
[1:49:00.680 --> 1:49:04.960]  terrible crisis destroying the economy people are dying people are you know
[1:49:04.960 --> 1:49:08.920]  getting sick and stay in our homes and oh even when you have the vaccines now
[1:49:08.920 --> 1:49:12.400]  you still can't leave you can never leave we're gonna have to tell you over an
[1:49:12.400 --> 1:49:15.880]  app where you can go what you can do and they've already got cartoons for kids
[1:49:15.880 --> 1:49:19.560]  saying you'll never leave your house unless your phone says you can this is
[1:49:19.560 --> 1:49:23.560]  total dystopia it's not coming it's here we must resist it and speak out
[1:49:23.560 --> 1:49:28.080]  against it now before it is submitted and habituated put into place Nick
[1:49:28.080 --> 1:49:31.640]  point has great job thank you so much and have a great weekend Christmas coming

[1:49:55.440 --> 1:50:00.800]  saying arrest Sean Hannity or Tucker Carlson I would be making a big deal
[1:50:00.800 --> 1:50:05.800]  about it but this is this is crazy and it shows who these little slime bags are
[1:50:05.800 --> 1:50:10.000]  and then just doing cursory re-investigation just remembering who

[1:53:32.240 --> 1:53:37.360]  we are all slaves we must stand up and declare our basic god-given human rights
[1:53:37.360 --> 1:53:39.520]  now
[1:53:39.520 --> 1:54:03.520]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:54:03.520 --> 1:54:07.200]  well take a carlson auction out of the park again last night I want to play
[1:54:07.200 --> 1:54:10.720]  about four or five minutes of what he had to say about big tech about to really
[1:54:10.720 --> 1:54:14.480]  take control of the white house now the republicans and trump totally failed to
[1:54:14.480 --> 1:54:17.560]  stop it they're still telling us top it was a bunch of them are on the payroll
[1:54:17.560 --> 1:54:21.800]  and presidents children kept playing footsie with google and others with
[1:54:21.800 --> 1:54:25.080]  apple and then we're gonna come back I'm gonna plunge into the latest coba news
[1:54:25.080 --> 1:54:29.320]  and former head of the CIA and NSA calling for my arrest and we have the
[1:54:29.320 --> 1:54:34.680]  big overstock CEO who's really brought out some incredible information joining
[1:54:34.680 --> 1:54:38.760]  us and then of course you've got to have the war room with a destroyer coming up
[1:54:38.760 --> 1:54:43.920]  but here's Tucker no I've never been a fan of Facebook as you probably know I've
[1:54:43.920 --> 1:54:51.080]  never been a big Zuckerberg fan I think he's a real problem they need to select
[1:54:51.080 --> 1:54:53.760]  Zuckerberg because they didn't think they can control them and all the
[1:54:53.760 --> 1:54:57.280]  conservatives meet on Facebook and talk about unauthorized things that was Joe
[1:54:57.280 --> 1:55:00.520]  Biden last December very different Joe Biden now he's not saying much about
[1:55:00.520 --> 1:55:05.120]  Facebook he's helping Facebook of course things have changed a lot since then
[1:55:05.120 --> 1:55:09.320]  Biden's transition team has started hiring top officials and lobbyists from
[1:55:09.320 --> 1:55:14.400]  Silicon Valley why well let's see Facebook and Twitter and Google to
[1:55:14.400 --> 1:55:18.240]  censored stories about Hunter Biden's business deals the Biden family's
[1:55:18.240 --> 1:55:21.600]  business deals with businesses connected directly to the Communist
[1:55:21.600 --> 1:55:25.840]  Chinese Party tonight we're learning more though dozens of executives at
[1:55:25.840 --> 1:55:31.160]  Facebook which Biden is not a fan and Twitter started spending big on Joe
[1:55:31.160 --> 1:55:35.560]  Biden in the race for example at Facebook the vice president of public
[1:55:35.560 --> 1:55:39.440]  policy Aaron Egan donated more than ninety nine thousand dollars to
[1:55:39.440 --> 1:55:43.200]  Democrats this year including Biden at Twitter a senior director of product
[1:55:43.200 --> 1:55:46.400]  management called James Kelm donated more than five grand just to Joe Biden
[1:55:46.400 --> 1:55:51.280]  and there are many more of course so in total what are these contributions the
[1:55:51.280 --> 1:55:56.240]  pattern of money moving from Silicon Valley into the coffers of the Democratic
[1:55:56.240 --> 1:56:00.880]  Party and Joe Biden what do they tell us Candace Owens is one of our all-time
[1:56:00.880 --> 1:56:03.860]  favorites we're happy to have her on tonight to unravel this mystery so
[1:56:03.860 --> 1:56:07.520]  Candace you look at these numbers you look at the behavior of the party what
[1:56:07.520 --> 1:56:15.320]  do you conclude I conclude that this is the least shocking story of 2020 for any
[1:56:15.320 --> 1:56:20.240]  American that has been paying attention to what we have been seeing this year in
[1:56:20.240 --> 1:56:23.600]  terms of what is really just mass censorship and here's what's really
[1:56:23.600 --> 1:56:27.840]  rich Tucker do you remember when the leftist media hacks were trying to
[1:56:27.840 --> 1:56:34.080]  convince us that the big evil scary GOP plot to voter suppress existed in
[1:56:34.080 --> 1:56:37.640]  people waiting in line to vote remember to cast their ballots in Georgia they
[1:56:37.640 --> 1:56:41.520]  showed a picture of a perfectly average line and said look the GOP is
[1:56:41.520 --> 1:56:45.160]  suppressing votes this is a form of voter suppression and every time you see
[1:56:45.160 --> 1:56:48.480]  something like this a ridiculous story you know that the job of a really good
[1:56:48.480 --> 1:56:52.960]  media hack is to make sure Americans are looking the wrong way when real crimes
[1:56:52.960 --> 1:56:57.160]  and real issues are actually peeping up one such issue is the way that Facebook
[1:56:57.160 --> 1:57:01.920]  and Twitter virtually intervened on this election cycle and they did this quite
[1:57:01.920 --> 1:57:05.760]  openly via fact-checkers that popped up out of nowhere fact-checkers that were
[1:57:05.760 --> 1:57:09.800]  pulling down stories like the Hunter Biden story suppressing it saying missing
[1:57:09.800 --> 1:57:13.920]  context we don't have the information Joe Biden hasn't confirmed that his son
[1:57:13.920 --> 1:57:18.040]  is guilty therefore this story is somehow untrue well we always knew if
[1:57:18.040 --> 1:57:20.640]  these fact-checkers weren't checking facts what they were doing was
[1:57:20.640 --> 1:57:25.480]  suppressing information and that is a form of voter suppression well of course
[1:57:25.480 --> 1:57:30.920]  it is and of course nothing's being done about it to this day but the clarity
[1:57:30.920 --> 1:57:37.360]  of the payoff here I mean even as Joe Biden is criticizing Facebook clearly
[1:57:37.360 --> 1:57:42.480]  didn't mean it Facebook's employees are sending him money Facebook's owners are
[1:57:42.480 --> 1:57:46.440]  working around the clock to get him elected spending a lot of hundreds of
[1:57:46.440 --> 1:57:55.160]  millions of dollars I mean they're basically buying the Biden people that's
[1:57:55.160 --> 1:57:58.160]  exactly right that's exactly right the American people know this and the
[1:57:58.160 --> 1:58:01.920]  question is what is going to actually be done about this obviously there exists
[1:58:01.920 --> 1:58:06.000]  some relationship behind the scenes and they feel comfortable under a Biden and
[1:58:06.000 --> 1:58:09.200]  Harris administration and they didn't have that level of comfort Trump was
[1:58:09.200 --> 1:58:13.240]  talking about revoking their protections under section 230 which they
[1:58:13.240 --> 1:58:17.120]  should by the way I'm not against Facebook having opinion or having a
[1:58:17.120 --> 1:58:21.120]  position as long as they are willing to admit that they are in fact a publisher
[1:58:21.120 --> 1:58:24.720]  you are a publisher you are pulling down information that you don't like
[1:58:24.720 --> 1:58:29.400]  because you are a publisher they should be afforded no protections under 230 and
[1:58:29.400 --> 1:58:34.000]  that's exactly what Trump was trying to do so I'm more than 230 organized crime
[1:58:34.000 --> 1:58:38.560]  syndicates working with foreign banks they're surveilling everyone and doing
[1:58:38.560 --> 1:58:43.400]  it in concerted effort and Congress is scared of them so they've taken out admit
[1:58:43.400 --> 1:58:50.800]  how much trouble we're in we are witnessing a perfect dichotomy of
[1:58:50.800 --> 1:58:55.120]  psychological warfare the United Nations the big corporations the globalist big
[1:58:55.120 --> 1:58:58.680]  tech and big farmer all pushing the covers most deadly thing in history even
[1:58:58.680 --> 1:59:03.400]  though statistically it's a very weak flu or cold but if you are deficient
[1:59:03.400 --> 1:59:06.640]  then you can actually die from it that's why you see somebody dying inside the
[1:59:06.640 --> 1:59:11.520]  nursing homes meanwhile all these top scientists and researchers and former
[1:59:11.520 --> 1:59:15.640]  Pfizer head medical officers have come out and said that the COVID-19 vaccine
[1:59:15.640 --> 1:59:19.640]  especially the mRNA ones are basically bio weapons that are super deadly and
[1:59:19.640 --> 1:59:23.640]  now they're having to resuscitate people that die basically when they take it
[1:59:23.640 --> 1:59:27.040]  just like newborn babies they give vaccines they have to resuscitate them
[1:59:27.040 --> 1:59:30.520]  all the time or a lot of times they just let them die and that's on the record it
[1:59:30.520 --> 1:59:34.960]  does that Guillain-Barre's narcolepsy cancer all these other diseases but they
[1:59:34.960 --> 1:59:37.520]  tell you safe and effective no one's getting hurt it's a conspiracy theory
[1:59:37.520 --> 1:59:42.040]  and then all the fine princess can kill you absolutely deadly so they run from
[1:59:42.040 --> 1:59:44.960]  something that isn't dangerous towards something that is incredibly dangerous
[1:59:44.960 --> 2:00:06.960]  because the media says it's safe they do it
[2:00:14.960 --> 2:00:26.960]  welcome back ladies and gentlemen we are now in to our number three next
[2:00:26.960 --> 2:00:31.680]  segment the former CIA director and head of the NSA has called for my arrest
[2:00:31.680 --> 2:00:36.800]  it's always nice to have that especially when you know how bad this dude is the
[2:00:36.800 --> 2:00:40.760]  horrible things he's been involved in I am very honored very happy very
[2:00:40.760 --> 2:00:45.240]  appreciative to see that going on but right now let's look at what's really
[2:00:45.240 --> 2:00:49.280]  going on and what's really behind the COVID lockdown the war on civilization
[2:00:49.280 --> 2:00:55.160]  the war on human activity the war on human spaces the war on life even the
[2:00:55.160 --> 2:01:00.440]  New York Times was like COVID has caused a war on human relations but it's for
[2:01:00.440 --> 2:01:04.200]  the good and it's causing millions to starve to death but it's good it's
[2:01:04.200 --> 2:01:07.480]  causing millions to commit suicide but it's good and it's causing millions to
[2:01:07.480 --> 2:01:10.760]  have cancer and heart attacks from no medical care but it's good even though
[2:01:10.760 --> 2:01:15.280]  it kills far fewer than all of that combined it doesn't matter but it's not
[2:01:15.280 --> 2:01:20.800]  COVID it's the lockdown killing everything that's what's unfolding here so
[2:01:20.800 --> 2:01:24.120]  let's go ahead and I'll direct you please but overhead shot to this right
[2:01:24.120 --> 2:01:30.600]  here TV viewers very important article up at info wars.com from the von
[2:01:30.600 --> 2:01:40.200]  Mies Institute by Michael Reckdenwald and it says what is the great reset part
[2:01:40.200 --> 2:01:48.880]  one reduced expectations and biotechno feudalism boy that is not a headline
[2:01:48.880 --> 2:01:56.360]  trying to sound smart that is exactly what I basically have called it what
[2:01:56.360 --> 2:02:00.840]  is the great reset teaching you you suck teaching you have nothing teaching you
[2:02:00.840 --> 2:02:05.360]  to have an economy based on having less having less freedoms less mobility less
[2:02:05.360 --> 2:02:09.680]  resources for you more for the establishment it's called slavery called
[2:02:09.680 --> 2:02:17.360]  feudalism it's called siege that's what it is part one reduced expectations and
[2:02:17.360 --> 2:02:24.200]  biotechno feudalism a biological technological straight jacket monitoring
[2:02:24.200 --> 2:02:28.280]  controlling everything you do to be able to step outside your door and forcing
[2:02:28.280 --> 2:02:34.040]  things into your body with the whole design to be to make you sick to make
[2:02:34.040 --> 2:02:37.840]  you stupid to make you poor to make you dead but to suck everything out of you
[2:02:37.840 --> 2:02:44.080]  before they do it to hobble you and disease you from birth to give you these
[2:02:44.080 --> 2:02:52.720]  diseases let's continue I suggest everyone everyone go to info wars.com
[2:02:52.720 --> 2:02:58.680]  and read this article and they lay out exactly the numbers how it's done the
[2:02:58.680 --> 2:03:03.440]  science how it's all a power grab fraud in the admissions of Klaus Schwab and
[2:03:03.440 --> 2:03:06.640]  the rest of them and look I know you've already heard this year for 30 years or
[2:03:06.640 --> 2:03:12.520]  27 years and that greener means less humans and greener means more slavery
[2:03:12.520 --> 2:03:18.880]  but the green horse of the apocalypse but that's what this is the pandemic road
[2:03:18.880 --> 2:03:23.760]  to serfdom absolutely and the globalists admit that you and admits they want new
[2:03:23.760 --> 2:03:28.320]  serfdom they don't want upwardly mobile populations remember when Obama went to
[2:03:28.320 --> 2:03:34.000]  Africa and he said you can't have cars or air conditioning period but no he can
[2:03:34.000 --> 2:03:39.840]  oh but he's not racist he's a he's a good guy here's CNN the pandemic has
[2:03:39.840 --> 2:03:43.480]  destroyed friendships and divided families you mean the political lockdown
[2:03:43.480 --> 2:03:48.360]  and hysteria and chicken little event is a societal crisis waging war on the
[2:03:48.360 --> 2:03:52.960]  public yes it is the pandemic hasn't starved millions of death you the
[2:03:52.960 --> 2:03:57.320]  trendy liberals that the heroes the leftist Melinda Gates was oh we had no
[2:03:57.320 --> 2:04:02.040]  idea how bad is hurt the economy when her own husband and said in his tabletop
[2:04:02.040 --> 2:04:05.720]  exercise before this was released that it would devastate the economy that'd be
[2:04:05.720 --> 2:04:11.560]  a good thing to slow the rate of growth to zero to cut our carbon footprint but
[2:04:11.560 --> 2:04:15.600]  she's out there going we had no idea like the head you and envoy for covid
[2:04:15.600 --> 2:04:19.560]  said you really shouldn't do lockdowns it's gonna start millions and like oh
[2:04:19.560 --> 2:04:27.720]  we're doing it well so oh we're sorry I really should shoot you so that's how
[2:04:27.720 --> 2:04:34.920]  this works great reset 61% of nations have decimated liberty with covid
[2:04:34.920 --> 2:04:38.600]  restrictions and it goes through the list of just the greatest attack on
[2:04:38.600 --> 2:04:43.760]  liberty ever seen the greatest turning back of the clocks makes Hitler blush the
[2:04:43.760 --> 2:04:47.240]  number of Americans that are depressed are considering suicide has soared
[2:04:47.240 --> 2:04:51.560]  because of the covid lockdowns with global suicides doubling the numbers
[2:04:51.560 --> 2:04:56.600]  are now into the millions that's okay it's not the covid chic mask and social
[2:04:56.600 --> 2:05:01.480]  distancing with AI robots telling us what to do and we have videos in
[2:05:01.480 --> 2:05:08.840]  Singapore in in China in New York City with robot dogs patrolling and barking
[2:05:08.840 --> 2:05:13.000]  at you and then with human voices tell you where you are masked where you are
[2:05:13.000 --> 2:05:17.760]  masked in an aggressive robot is where you are masked seriously we'll play the
[2:05:17.760 --> 2:05:22.000]  video for a few minutes so oh the robots are suddenly on the streets to in the
[2:05:22.000 --> 2:05:27.720]  drones yes so it's the rollout of all the stuff we wouldn't put up with to get
[2:05:27.720 --> 2:05:32.480]  us all confused in this big dystopic lockdown strict covid-19 restrictions
[2:05:32.480 --> 2:05:36.240]  prompt defiance and anger in California Wall Street Journal is small
[2:05:36.240 --> 2:05:41.320]  businesses are told they have to totally close my arbitrary digital maps like
[2:05:41.320 --> 2:05:46.120]  oh MGM can stay open but your little hotdog stand can't see how it works
[2:05:46.120 --> 2:05:52.000]  you're not a stakeholder as the UN calls it and I've never really liked Tom
[2:05:52.000 --> 2:05:56.560]  Cruz I think he's one of the most overrated actors there is he's a
[2:05:56.560 --> 2:06:02.560]  weirdo but now we know he wants to run a cult the audio is up at info wars dot
[2:06:02.560 --> 2:06:07.000]  com he yells and screams for three and a half minutes as his employees saying I
[2:06:07.000 --> 2:06:14.080]  will effing get you fired you will be blackballed if you take off your mask or
[2:06:14.080 --> 2:06:17.120]  you get within six feet of each other but then he's in all these fight scenes
[2:06:17.120 --> 2:06:22.240]  and things and can and can touch people he's a cult leader that loves to see
[2:06:22.240 --> 2:06:26.440]  people under his control doing whatever he wants yes people reportedly at his
[2:06:26.440 --> 2:06:33.840]  house that polishes home with q-tips but aren't allowed to talk to him or look
[2:06:33.840 --> 2:06:37.080]  at him it's the same thing with Hillary it's the same with all these
[2:06:37.080 --> 2:06:43.000]  globalists oh don't look at Tom Cruz what a sack of authoritarian garbage burn
[2:06:43.000 --> 2:06:47.760]  in hell you little Satanist on a power drill about how great you are and how
[2:06:47.760 --> 2:06:52.400]  amazing you are and how how ascendant you are as you bring in global collapse
[2:06:52.400 --> 2:06:59.160]  and extermination burn in hell inside the small Washington town to find the
[2:06:59.160 --> 2:07:03.160]  lockdown despite state orders hey better not go there Tom Cruz it's for all the
[2:07:03.160 --> 2:07:07.800]  normal people that aren't scum like you live with icu's hitting capacity
[2:07:07.800 --> 2:07:12.560]  hospitals turn to desperate measures I've had nurses on I've had managers on
[2:07:12.560 --> 2:07:17.120]  we've had whistleblowers on the hospitals are almost completely empty but
[2:07:17.120 --> 2:07:22.760]  they will say oh our COVID ICU is 10 beds and when those fill up they do a
[2:07:22.760 --> 2:07:26.560]  photo ops saying oh my gosh we're totally full but John Hopkins reported we
[2:07:26.560 --> 2:07:31.480]  have the same number of dead people in 2020 that we had last year at this time
[2:07:31.480 --> 2:07:38.560]  see they're just hyping things up with Kabuki theater pink dot delivery robots
[2:07:38.560 --> 2:07:43.320]  Cruz West Hollywood so a human doesn't have to deliver it to you you're safe I
[2:07:43.320 --> 2:07:49.320]  told you that was coming safe this is all just a drill for the real lockdowns
[2:07:49.320 --> 2:07:54.680]  that are coming Times Square New Year's evil not have public audience oh now
[2:07:54.680 --> 2:08:01.160]  it's totally shut down I'll get to more of this next segment the former CIA
[2:08:01.160 --> 2:08:04.320]  director that wants me arrested he attacked Trump and he attacked them and
[2:08:04.320 --> 2:08:07.800]  said the Supreme Court they ruled that churches could stay open even though
[2:08:07.800 --> 2:08:10.920]  they have no law to do that no one should close the church's courts and
[2:08:10.920 --> 2:08:14.320]  local governments have no power but the Supreme Court basically said that Hayden
[2:08:14.320 --> 2:08:17.960]  came out and said oh you're murdering people and showed a picture of a mass
[2:08:17.960 --> 2:08:21.560]  grave and nothing to with COVID and then like a day later said look I'm at a
[2:08:21.560 --> 2:08:25.560]  Pittsburgh Steelers game it's so awesome and everybody's shoulder to shoulder do
[2:08:25.560 --> 2:08:29.960]  do do do do do do do do do do do but see it's all about we open what we want but
[2:08:29.960 --> 2:08:32.080]  You don't open what you want. See how it works?
[2:08:33.400 --> 2:08:36.120]  Pompeo tests negative for COVID-19.
[2:08:36.120 --> 2:08:37.320]  Well, quarantine.
[2:08:37.320 --> 2:08:38.160]  Oh my gosh.
[2:08:38.160 --> 2:08:39.320]  Oh, it's so scary.
[2:08:39.320 --> 2:08:42.560]  Even though it has a death rate of like 0.00 or whatever.
[2:08:42.560 --> 2:08:45.800]  It's all just an excuse for Tom Cruise and Nancy Pelosi
[2:08:45.800 --> 2:08:47.640]  to just act arrogant and scream at people
[2:08:47.640 --> 2:08:49.200]  and do whatever they want.
[2:08:49.200 --> 2:08:51.040]  Over-the-counter home test for COVID-19,
[2:08:51.040 --> 2:08:52.080]  it's U.S. green light.
[2:08:52.080 --> 2:08:54.080]  So we can have more hysteria, more fear.
[2:08:55.120 --> 2:08:57.760]  Kansas mayor resigns over violent threats
[2:08:57.760 --> 2:08:59.680]  for backing mass mandate.
[2:08:59.680 --> 2:09:01.760]  I don't feel safe anymore.
[2:09:01.760 --> 2:09:04.520]  Well, move to North Korea, you witch.
[2:09:04.520 --> 2:09:06.560]  And we've got these perpetual fake articles,
[2:09:06.560 --> 2:09:08.200]  like a hand grasping.
[2:09:08.200 --> 2:09:12.080]  Trump appointees described the crushing of the CDC
[2:09:12.080 --> 2:09:15.400]  when Trump would not want them to create fear
[2:09:15.400 --> 2:09:17.400]  and would put out false science.
[2:09:17.400 --> 2:09:19.080]  You're the ones lying about the death numbers.
[2:09:19.080 --> 2:09:20.200]  You're the ones that said it would be
[2:09:20.200 --> 2:09:21.960]  two and a half million dead in the first few months
[2:09:21.960 --> 2:09:22.800]  and it wasn't.
[2:09:22.800 --> 2:09:24.840]  You're the ones that said at a three to 5% death rate.
[2:09:24.840 --> 2:09:25.960]  You're not the science.
[2:09:25.960 --> 2:09:27.400]  You're the big pharma whores.
[2:09:27.400 --> 2:09:28.520]  You're the liars.
[2:09:28.520 --> 2:09:30.320]  Tell us the hospitals are full
[2:09:30.320 --> 2:09:32.040]  and they're not, you damn liars.
[2:09:33.320 --> 2:09:35.560]  But they're coming with real strains.
[2:09:35.560 --> 2:09:37.600]  The lockdown is so when they release the real weapon
[2:09:37.600 --> 2:09:38.800]  they can kill you and your family.
[2:09:38.800 --> 2:09:41.080]  You're all gonna be dead within a few years
[2:09:41.080 --> 2:09:42.520]  unless you wake up to this.
[2:09:42.520 --> 2:09:44.680]  They'll be back as I take on the scumbags.
[2:09:46.200 --> 2:09:48.400]  You must guard your humanity.
[2:09:48.400 --> 2:09:50.480]  You must guard your children's humanity.
[2:09:51.320 --> 2:09:54.080]  You must guard the very genetic code of the planet.
[2:09:54.080 --> 2:09:55.480]  The globalists have set themselves up
[2:09:55.480 --> 2:09:57.320]  as the guardians of this world.
[2:09:57.320 --> 2:09:59.680]  But they are the ones that are overriding
[2:09:59.680 --> 2:10:02.560]  every genetic system and poisoning the planet.
[2:10:02.560 --> 2:10:04.560]  They are the ones that are now engaged
[2:10:04.560 --> 2:10:08.160]  in genetic takeover of every human on earth
[2:10:08.160 --> 2:10:10.000]  to the GMO crops.
[2:10:10.000 --> 2:10:12.440]  And now they've moved on to their main target,
[2:10:12.440 --> 2:10:14.560]  to maddening with the mRNA vaccines,
[2:10:14.560 --> 2:10:16.040]  which are not vaccines.
[2:10:17.000 --> 2:10:21.520]  They are recombinant DNA from aborted cloned fetuses
[2:10:22.520 --> 2:10:24.840]  where they inserted into your genome
[2:10:24.840 --> 2:10:28.040]  to take over your body's systems.
[2:10:28.040 --> 2:10:32.880]  Go read the actual inserts for the mRNA vaccines
[2:10:32.880 --> 2:10:35.040]  and then remember you've been warned.
[2:10:35.040 --> 2:10:38.000]  This is the equivalent of an alien takeover.
[2:10:38.000 --> 2:10:40.360]  Whether it's interdimensional, whether it's little green men,
[2:10:40.360 --> 2:10:42.280]  the globalists are acting like another species
[2:10:42.280 --> 2:10:44.120]  that's overtaking us and overriding us.
[2:10:44.120 --> 2:10:45.640]  It's all the same in the end.
[2:10:45.640 --> 2:10:49.400]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[2:10:49.400 --> 2:10:52.120]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts
[2:10:52.120 --> 2:10:53.760]  you refuse to accept.
[2:10:53.760 --> 2:10:55.760]  If you have a family member suffering
[2:10:55.760 --> 2:10:58.160]  from this degenerative mental condition,
[2:10:58.160 --> 2:11:00.440]  buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil
[2:11:00.440 --> 2:11:02.560]  from InfowarsStore.com.
[2:11:02.560 --> 2:11:04.960]  Studies have suggested that fish oils
[2:11:04.960 --> 2:11:06.760]  and fish oil supplementation
[2:11:06.760 --> 2:11:08.840]  can slightly lower blood pressure,
[2:11:08.840 --> 2:11:10.920]  decrease triglyceride levels,
[2:11:10.920 --> 2:11:13.040]  decrease the growth rate of plaque
[2:11:13.040 --> 2:11:16.880]  and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses
[2:11:16.880 --> 2:11:19.240]  in joints and the digestive system.
[2:11:19.240 --> 2:11:22.600]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA
[2:11:22.600 --> 2:11:26.320]  and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function
[2:11:26.320 --> 2:11:28.440]  by increasing the concentration
[2:11:28.440 --> 2:11:30.720]  and activity of immune cells.
[2:11:30.720 --> 2:11:33.680]  It worked for my family and now I can have
[2:11:33.680 --> 2:11:37.320]  a logical and calm discussion about actual facts
[2:11:37.320 --> 2:11:39.280]  that pertain to reality.
[2:11:39.280 --> 2:11:42.280]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member
[2:11:42.280 --> 2:11:45.280]  or yourself at InfowarsStore.com.
[2:11:45.280 --> 2:11:50.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:12:15.280 --> 2:12:18.360]  Goin' till the sun fell down.
[2:12:18.360 --> 2:12:19.880]  You keep it going.
[2:12:23.480 --> 2:12:27.280]  Well, yesterday, I was getting more emails
[2:12:27.280 --> 2:12:30.160]  and more calls about singin' in
[2:12:30.160 --> 2:12:34.000]  and all these publications saying Alex Jones
[2:12:34.000 --> 2:12:35.120]  may be arrested.
[2:12:36.160 --> 2:12:38.880]  On Saturday, there were a lot of publications that said,
[2:12:38.880 --> 2:12:42.080]  I gave a speech in DC, did Jones threaten to kill Biden?
[2:12:42.080 --> 2:12:45.720]  And then by Sunday, calls for Jones to be arrested
[2:12:45.720 --> 2:12:47.800]  for threatening to kill Joe Biden.
[2:12:47.800 --> 2:12:50.400]  And then by Monday, Alex Jones to be arrested
[2:12:50.400 --> 2:12:51.480]  for threatening to kill Joe Biden.
[2:12:51.480 --> 2:12:52.400]  That's how the media works,
[2:12:52.400 --> 2:12:55.480]  how they're gaslighting and fraud works.
[2:12:55.480 --> 2:12:59.080]  And then by Tuesday, former head of the CIA
[2:12:59.080 --> 2:13:01.360]  and former head of the NSA,
[2:13:01.360 --> 2:13:04.800]  Michael Vincent Hayden, very horrible, corrupt,
[2:13:04.800 --> 2:13:07.720]  deceptive career, we can make a whole film about,
[2:13:07.720 --> 2:13:10.320]  he weighed in agreeing with a viral tweet
[2:13:10.320 --> 2:13:13.920]  that, yes, I should be arrested.
[2:13:15.320 --> 2:13:16.800]  Now, what did I say?
[2:13:16.800 --> 2:13:18.920]  What did they take quotes out of?
[2:13:18.920 --> 2:13:21.360]  I said, this guy's a reanimated corpse.
[2:13:21.360 --> 2:13:23.000]  That means I'm not gonna kill him.
[2:13:23.000 --> 2:13:24.280]  I'm saying he's like a zombie.
[2:13:24.280 --> 2:13:26.040]  He looks like he's dead, the Crip Keeper.
[2:13:26.040 --> 2:13:27.160]  Very clear what I was saying.
[2:13:27.160 --> 2:13:28.240]  Say it all the time.
[2:13:28.240 --> 2:13:29.560]  And I said, one way or another,
[2:13:29.560 --> 2:13:33.240]  he will be removed whether he gets in as the president
[2:13:33.240 --> 2:13:35.520]  through this election or whether it's impeachment.
[2:13:35.520 --> 2:13:38.040]  The last thing I'd want would be to kill him.
[2:13:38.040 --> 2:13:42.840]  Now, before we get to Pelosi,
[2:13:42.840 --> 2:13:44.160]  let's play what I actually had to say.
[2:13:44.160 --> 2:13:45.000]  Here it is.
[2:13:45.000 --> 2:13:47.080]  We will never back down to the Satanic,
[2:13:47.080 --> 2:13:49.800]  pedophile, globalist, new world order,
[2:13:51.160 --> 2:13:56.160]  and their walking dead, reanimated corpse, Joe Biden.
[2:13:58.440 --> 2:14:01.800]  And we will never recognize him.
[2:14:01.800 --> 2:14:06.320]  Trump, President Trump had zero connection to Russians,
[2:14:06.320 --> 2:14:09.480]  no proof, four years of investigation,
[2:14:09.480 --> 2:14:12.520]  when the Biden's hits open and shut.
[2:14:12.520 --> 2:14:14.600]  So I don't know who's going to the White House
[2:14:14.600 --> 2:14:17.840]  in 38 days, but I sure know this.
[2:14:17.840 --> 2:14:20.200]  Joe Biden is a globalist,
[2:14:20.200 --> 2:14:23.920]  and Joe Biden will be removed one way or another.
[2:14:23.920 --> 2:14:24.760]  Okay.
[2:14:28.760 --> 2:14:33.360]  So now let's go to Pelosi saying basically the same thing
[2:14:33.360 --> 2:14:38.360]  last year, and we took it as election fraud or impeachment.
[2:14:38.520 --> 2:14:39.360]  That's what she was saying.
[2:14:39.360 --> 2:14:41.600]  She said whether we impeach him or whether we remove him
[2:14:41.600 --> 2:14:46.600]  or whether he's taken out the ballot box, he will be gone.
[2:14:48.320 --> 2:14:51.040]  Now, when Phil Mudd on CNN said we're going to kill Trump,
[2:14:51.040 --> 2:14:52.880]  that's a threat, there were plenty of threats.
[2:14:52.880 --> 2:14:54.640]  And the media was like, yes, these are good,
[2:14:54.640 --> 2:14:55.880]  but I wasn't threatening Biden,
[2:14:55.880 --> 2:14:57.440]  and I'm not backpedaling here.
[2:14:57.440 --> 2:15:00.840]  This is the incredible deception of these individuals.
[2:15:00.840 --> 2:15:02.960]  And again, how they think if they lie about you,
[2:15:02.960 --> 2:15:05.160]  it makes it so, more gaslighting.
[2:15:05.160 --> 2:15:07.560]  So here's what Pelosi had to say.
[2:15:07.560 --> 2:15:09.000]  But again, it's Sunday morning.
[2:15:09.000 --> 2:15:11.200]  Let's be optimistic about the future,
[2:15:11.200 --> 2:15:15.280]  a future that will not have Donald Trump in the White House.
[2:15:15.280 --> 2:15:17.680]  One way or another, 10 months from now,
[2:15:17.680 --> 2:15:21.680]  we will have an election if we don't have him removed sooner.
[2:15:21.680 --> 2:15:24.600]  But again, he will be impeached forever.
[2:15:24.600 --> 2:15:25.440]  And that's what I said.
[2:15:25.440 --> 2:15:27.920]  I said, I don't know, in 38 days, he'll be in there
[2:15:27.920 --> 2:15:30.320]  or we get rid of another way, one way or another.
[2:15:30.320 --> 2:15:31.160]  Same thing.
[2:15:31.160 --> 2:15:34.360]  That same thing, but when they're saying
[2:15:34.360 --> 2:15:36.080]  we're going to kill him, we need to kill him.
[2:15:36.080 --> 2:15:37.400]  The New York Times has articles saying
[2:15:37.400 --> 2:15:38.840]  we're gonna assassinate Trump.
[2:15:38.840 --> 2:15:39.720]  He needs to be assassinated.
[2:15:39.720 --> 2:15:41.240]  Oh, that's cute and fun.
[2:15:41.240 --> 2:15:42.760]  But now they're all over Twitter.
[2:15:42.760 --> 2:15:44.640]  I mean, hundreds of thousands of tweets.
[2:15:44.640 --> 2:15:46.560]  Oh, arrest him now, get him now.
[2:15:46.560 --> 2:15:49.880]  Oh, arrest Trump too.
[2:15:49.880 --> 2:15:51.200]  Their authoritarians is what they are.
[2:15:51.200 --> 2:15:55.000]  A bunch of frothing, limp-wristed, anti-American scum
[2:15:55.000 --> 2:15:58.160]  who don't respect due process and who want me arrested.
[2:15:58.160 --> 2:16:01.360]  And then imagine, the former CIA director,
[2:16:01.360 --> 2:16:05.120]  who was a desk jockey at the Air Force,
[2:16:05.120 --> 2:16:07.880]  never in any combat, he was part of a scandal
[2:16:07.880 --> 2:16:11.560]  where they gave a bunch of generals silver stars.
[2:16:11.560 --> 2:16:13.680]  So he talks about he's a silver star recipient
[2:16:13.680 --> 2:16:15.920]  just because he was in the military
[2:16:15.920 --> 2:16:18.880]  during the 2003 Gulf War.
[2:16:18.880 --> 2:16:20.680]  He wasn't there, but he was in the military.
[2:16:20.680 --> 2:16:22.640]  I mean, this is a stolen Valor monster.
[2:16:22.640 --> 2:16:23.480]  He also is involved
[2:16:23.480 --> 2:16:26.320]  with some very mysterious international orphanages
[2:16:26.320 --> 2:16:28.160]  and transfer of children.
[2:16:28.160 --> 2:16:30.120]  I can tell you that's being looked into already.
[2:16:30.120 --> 2:16:31.760]  I got contacted by some folks.
[2:16:31.760 --> 2:16:33.560]  I'll just leave it at that.
[2:16:33.560 --> 2:16:35.840]  And that's why I said he looks like a child molester.
[2:16:35.840 --> 2:16:37.120]  I'm not saying he's a child molester.
[2:16:37.120 --> 2:16:38.440]  I'm just saying,
[2:16:38.440 --> 2:16:40.600]  Ryan Stelter looks about as creepy as you get.
[2:16:40.600 --> 2:16:41.840]  You're not gonna let him babysit your kids.
[2:16:41.840 --> 2:16:43.960]  You look at Hayden's own Twitter photo,
[2:16:43.960 --> 2:16:44.920]  is the creepiest photo.
[2:16:44.920 --> 2:16:47.200]  Please pull up Michael T. Hayden's Twitter folks.
[2:16:47.200 --> 2:16:48.040]  I want to show people.
[2:16:48.040 --> 2:16:51.280]  He's like in a Steelers cap on a mountaintop,
[2:16:51.280 --> 2:16:52.720]  looking about as scary.
[2:16:52.720 --> 2:16:55.400]  I mean, he looks like a Hellraiser character or something.
[2:16:55.400 --> 2:16:59.640]  I mean, that's a nightmare situation right there.
[2:16:59.640 --> 2:17:01.480]  But remember, he told Congress,
[2:17:01.480 --> 2:17:02.840]  no spy on American people.
[2:17:02.840 --> 2:17:04.760]  Then he said the Fourth Amendment says
[2:17:04.760 --> 2:17:08.680]  that they could spy on you without a warrant.
[2:17:08.680 --> 2:17:10.280]  I mean, this guy is a fraud.
[2:17:10.280 --> 2:17:13.160]  And then I'll show you just on his Twitter feed
[2:17:13.160 --> 2:17:17.200]  what a giant, huge, mega massive fraud Hayden is.
[2:17:17.200 --> 2:17:20.480]  But here's Hayden back during the Bush administration
[2:17:20.480 --> 2:17:22.160]  engaging in the giant lies.
[2:17:22.160 --> 2:17:24.040]  My understanding is that the Fourth Amendment
[2:17:24.040 --> 2:17:26.720]  of the Constitution specifies
[2:17:26.720 --> 2:17:29.640]  that you must have probable cause
[2:17:29.640 --> 2:17:32.400]  to be able to do a search
[2:17:32.400 --> 2:17:35.080]  that does not violate an American's right
[2:17:35.080 --> 2:17:39.200]  against unlawful searches and seizures.
[2:17:39.200 --> 2:17:42.400]  Actually, the Fourth Amendment actually protects
[2:17:42.400 --> 2:17:45.320]  all of us against unreasonable search and seizure.
[2:17:45.320 --> 2:17:46.720]  But that's what that says.
[2:17:46.720 --> 2:17:49.040]  The measure is probable cause, I believe.
[2:17:49.040 --> 2:17:51.680]  The amendment says unreasonable search and seizure.
[2:17:51.680 --> 2:17:53.080]  But does it not say probable?
[2:17:53.080 --> 2:17:53.920]  No.
[2:17:53.920 --> 2:17:55.480]  The right of the people to be secure
[2:17:55.480 --> 2:17:57.360]  in their person's houses, papers,
[2:17:57.360 --> 2:18:00.920]  and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures
[2:18:00.920 --> 2:18:02.160]  shall not be violated.
[2:18:02.160 --> 2:18:04.480]  No warrant shall issue.
[2:18:04.480 --> 2:18:06.720]  But upon probable cause.
[2:18:06.720 --> 2:18:08.840]  But upon probable cause.
[2:18:08.840 --> 2:18:11.280]  Probable cause, probable cause.
[2:18:11.280 --> 2:18:13.480]  Just to be very clear, okay?
[2:18:13.480 --> 2:18:15.240]  And believe me, if there's any amendment
[2:18:15.240 --> 2:18:16.600]  to the Constitution that employs
[2:18:16.600 --> 2:18:18.360]  of the national security aids you're familiar with,
[2:18:18.360 --> 2:18:19.600]  it's the Fourth.
[2:18:19.600 --> 2:18:21.880]  Okay, so this man is a total liar.
[2:18:21.880 --> 2:18:23.520]  Here's the headlines.
[2:18:23.520 --> 2:18:25.600]  Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones may face charges
[2:18:25.600 --> 2:18:29.800]  for apparent Biden threat, Kevin Shoroff.
[2:18:29.800 --> 2:18:32.000]  New former director of the national security agency
[2:18:32.000 --> 2:18:34.480]  says he agrees Alex Jones should be immediately arrested
[2:18:34.480 --> 2:18:36.320]  for threats he's made against President-elect Joe Biden's
[2:18:36.320 --> 2:18:37.160]  life.
[2:18:38.240 --> 2:18:40.640]  And here's Hayden saying he agrees.
[2:18:40.640 --> 2:18:42.600]  I think he wants to be arrested.
[2:18:42.600 --> 2:18:45.080]  Meanwhile, he put out a bunch of tweets saying,
[2:18:45.080 --> 2:18:46.560]  pro-life about Trump.
[2:18:46.560 --> 2:18:51.440]  Thank you, Amy COVID Barrett, for groundbreaking decision.
[2:18:51.440 --> 2:18:54.720]  And then they put out, it's a joke account,
[2:18:54.720 --> 2:18:57.000]  an image of a mass grave implying
[2:18:57.000 --> 2:18:58.360]  that Trump's killing everybody
[2:18:58.360 --> 2:19:01.560]  because the Supreme Court ruled churches could be opened
[2:19:01.560 --> 2:19:04.000]  as unconstitutional to close them.
[2:19:04.000 --> 2:19:07.120]  But then literally days later, this is November 26th,
[2:19:08.080 --> 2:19:10.160]  he go to his Twitter and show people this guys,
[2:19:10.160 --> 2:19:12.880]  he puts out a Pittsburgh Steelers.
[2:19:12.880 --> 2:19:14.560]  That's November 26th.
[2:19:14.560 --> 2:19:19.560]  On November 27th, he tweets, let's do some football.
[2:19:19.560 --> 2:19:21.720]  Pittsburgh proud, happy birthday.
[2:19:21.720 --> 2:19:23.840]  No social distancing NFL game.
[2:19:26.000 --> 2:19:28.960]  Now folks, again, imagine the irony of this.
[2:19:28.960 --> 2:19:32.440]  He's saying Trump is mass graving people.
[2:19:32.440 --> 2:19:34.640]  Trump is murdering people because of Baptist
[2:19:34.640 --> 2:19:36.560]  or Catholic church or Buddhist temple
[2:19:36.560 --> 2:19:39.400]  or mosque can be opened with 10 people, 1,000, whatever.
[2:19:39.400 --> 2:19:42.040]  Walmart can be open, Target can be open,
[2:19:42.040 --> 2:19:46.400]  Disneyland can be open, but your churches can't.
[2:19:46.400 --> 2:19:48.000]  Liquor stores are open.
[2:19:48.000 --> 2:19:50.960]  All this is going on, but he's a big Pittsburgh Steelers fan.
[2:19:50.960 --> 2:19:52.600]  They actually work with Pittsburgh Steelers.
[2:19:52.600 --> 2:19:56.080]  I'm stalking you Hayden, open source baby.
[2:19:56.080 --> 2:19:57.560]  Lot of stuff coming out on Hayden.
[2:19:57.560 --> 2:20:00.040]  It's the time, it's the time for it to happen.
[2:20:00.040 --> 2:20:01.760]  So you want me in jail Hayden?
[2:20:01.760 --> 2:20:02.920]  Well, you might be going to jail
[2:20:02.920 --> 2:20:05.000]  of what we're gonna be releasing on you real soon.
[2:20:05.000 --> 2:20:06.840]  Now you work for the Bushes and other crime families.
[2:20:06.840 --> 2:20:10.120]  So this is the time for total release of information.
[2:20:10.120 --> 2:20:12.840]  From speaking of that, we have the former CEO of Overstock
[2:20:12.840 --> 2:20:15.360]  who just gave a bomb shell interview
[2:20:15.360 --> 2:20:17.640]  about how he was recruited by the FBI
[2:20:17.640 --> 2:20:18.960]  in a stinging of Hillary Clinton,
[2:20:18.960 --> 2:20:21.280]  which they then shut down after he'd already stung her.
[2:20:21.280 --> 2:20:22.440]  That is coming up.
[2:20:22.440 --> 2:20:26.440]  Patrick J. Burney on the other side of this quick break.
[2:20:26.440 --> 2:20:30.240]  I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com, newswars.com.
[2:20:30.240 --> 2:20:32.560]  Tomorrow's news today.
[2:20:32.560 --> 2:20:36.800]  Whatever you do, stay with us and spread the word
[2:20:36.800 --> 2:20:39.760]  because you're going to want to hear this information
[2:20:39.760 --> 2:20:41.720]  with Patrick on the other side.
[2:20:44.640 --> 2:20:46.280]  During our war for independence,
[2:20:46.280 --> 2:20:48.080]  during some of the darkest days,
[2:20:48.080 --> 2:20:50.680]  Thomas Jefferson, the man credited with writing our
[2:20:50.680 --> 2:20:51.720]  Declaration of Independence
[2:20:51.720 --> 2:20:54.000]  and much of our constitution later said,
[2:20:54.000 --> 2:20:55.280]  look, this is not going to be an easy fight.
[2:20:55.280 --> 2:20:57.320]  We're not going to be transported to liberty
[2:20:57.320 --> 2:20:59.440]  on a bed of feathers.
[2:20:59.440 --> 2:21:00.680]  No, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:21:00.680 --> 2:21:03.080]  we've actually had incredible successes
[2:21:03.080 --> 2:21:05.480]  with Donald Trump and Bolsonaro
[2:21:05.480 --> 2:21:06.760]  and the Liberty Movement worldwide.
[2:21:06.760 --> 2:21:08.040]  We're going to have major setbacks,
[2:21:08.040 --> 2:21:11.080]  but there is a giant awakening happening.
[2:21:11.080 --> 2:21:12.440]  That's what the Globals have gone ahead
[2:21:12.440 --> 2:21:14.080]  and launched their great reset.
[2:21:14.080 --> 2:21:16.680]  Global collapse, worldwide social credit score,
[2:21:16.680 --> 2:21:20.200]  tracking app, microchip, force modulation takeover now
[2:21:20.200 --> 2:21:21.760]  because if they don't force it now,
[2:21:21.760 --> 2:21:22.920]  they're never going to get it.
[2:21:22.920 --> 2:21:24.920]  So, info wars has never been more critical.

[2:21:44.160 --> 2:21:45.880]  Most of the world submitted
[2:21:45.880 --> 2:21:48.560]  to the unconstitutional criminal lockdowns
[2:21:48.560 --> 2:21:51.760]  directed by the comics Chinese and the United Nations.
[2:21:51.760 --> 2:21:54.200]  And now because the slaves have proven themselves
[2:21:54.200 --> 2:21:57.280]  to be subservient, the worst Australian models
[2:21:57.280 --> 2:22:00.000]  of complete lockdowns you can't even leave your house
[2:22:00.000 --> 2:22:02.280]  for months and months are being announced
[2:22:02.280 --> 2:22:04.280]  and in Germany, the police are using
[2:22:04.280 --> 2:22:06.680]  giant armored tanks with water cannons
[2:22:06.680 --> 2:22:08.520]  to blast men, women and children
[2:22:08.520 --> 2:22:11.000]  that protest the fact that Merkel, the dictator,
[2:22:11.000 --> 2:22:12.720]  has put them under her control.
[2:22:12.720 --> 2:22:14.320]  That's right, she's been rigging elections
[2:22:14.320 --> 2:22:15.920]  for years and years.
[2:22:15.920 --> 2:22:18.880]  And the same thing is coming here to the United States.
[2:22:18.880 --> 2:22:20.360]  This is world government.
[2:22:20.360 --> 2:22:23.200]  In Philadelphia, they've announced four people or more
[2:22:23.200 --> 2:22:25.080]  seen together will be arrested.
[2:22:25.080 --> 2:22:27.120]  They're announcing that Christmas is canceled.
[2:22:27.120 --> 2:22:29.520]  This is what the communist takeover looks like
[2:22:29.520 --> 2:22:32.640]  to bankrupt you, to take rid of all your due process
[2:22:32.640 --> 2:22:37.200]  and absolutely transform the world into a prison planet.
[2:22:37.200 --> 2:22:39.240]  How long have we warned you about this?
[2:22:39.240 --> 2:22:42.200]  You can fight back, America is the last bastion.
[2:22:42.200 --> 2:22:43.400]  Stop submitting.
[2:22:45.760 --> 2:22:47.520]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut.
[2:22:47.520 --> 2:22:48.520]  You're on the air, thanks for holding.
[2:22:48.520 --> 2:22:49.560]  Yeah, hello, can you hear me?
[2:22:49.560 --> 2:22:50.680]  I sure can, sir, thank you.
[2:22:50.680 --> 2:22:52.240]  Hey, Alex, before I start, man,
[2:22:52.240 --> 2:22:54.400]  I just, I've been wanting to talk to you, bro,
[2:22:54.400 --> 2:22:57.480]  and it's a pleasure to be talking right now here, man.
[2:22:57.480 --> 2:22:58.960]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[2:22:58.960 --> 2:23:00.520]  I'm from New Brink, Connecticut,
[2:23:00.520 --> 2:23:03.880]  and I just want to plug in, I'm a truck driver
[2:23:03.880 --> 2:23:07.080]  and two before us have changed the way I drive.
[2:23:07.080 --> 2:23:10.640]  Me and my brothers that drive and a couple of us,
[2:23:10.640 --> 2:23:14.040]  we are Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans.
[2:23:14.040 --> 2:23:18.040]  We used to be on Monster and Red Bull and Rolla,
[2:23:18.040 --> 2:23:20.280]  and I have lost weight because I stopped drinking
[2:23:20.280 --> 2:23:22.840]  all that sugar, and I just want to thank you for that, man.
[2:23:22.840 --> 2:23:24.520]  Well, brother, we put more in this
[2:23:24.520 --> 2:23:28.440]  than any other long-term high quality energy powder there is.
[2:23:28.440 --> 2:23:30.760]  So this was designed on one of the top guys in the country.
[2:23:30.760 --> 2:23:31.680]  He didn't want his name on it
[2:23:31.680 --> 2:23:33.200]  because obviously the political issues,
[2:23:33.200 --> 2:23:35.000]  but we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation
[2:23:35.000 --> 2:23:35.840]  just for the design of it.
[2:23:35.840 --> 2:23:38.040]  And we believe it is the best, strongest,
[2:23:38.040 --> 2:23:39.880]  but healthiest energy out there,
[2:23:39.880 --> 2:23:41.720]  and you're saying that it's made your life better,
[2:23:41.720 --> 2:23:42.560]  so that means a lot to me.
[2:23:42.560 --> 2:23:43.800]  Thank you to all your truck drivers.
[2:23:43.800 --> 2:23:44.640]  We love you.
[2:23:46.960 --> 2:23:50.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:23:50.040 --> 2:24:00.040]  I bribed Hillary Clinton $18 million.
[2:24:00.040 --> 2:24:02.040]  I facilitated a bribe for Hillary Clinton
[2:24:02.040 --> 2:24:06.040]  on January 14th, 2016, right here in this town.
[2:24:06.040 --> 2:24:08.040]  Hillary Clinton, on behalf of the FBI,
[2:24:08.040 --> 2:24:12.040]  they came to me around December 1st, 2015.
[2:24:12.040 --> 2:24:13.040]  They told me, you know,
[2:24:13.040 --> 2:24:15.040]  I'm not going to be able to do that.
[2:24:15.040 --> 2:24:17.040]  I'm not going to be able to do that.
[2:24:17.040 --> 2:24:19.040]  I'm not going to be able to do that.
[2:24:19.040 --> 2:24:21.040]  In 2015, they told me Hillary Clinton
[2:24:21.040 --> 2:24:24.040]  had accepted a bribe from Turkey for $20 million.
[2:24:24.040 --> 2:24:27.040]  They told me that I would be working for a group
[2:24:27.040 --> 2:24:30.040]  in New York, FBI agents, who had authorization
[2:24:30.040 --> 2:24:32.040]  to set Hillary Clinton up in a sting.
[2:24:32.040 --> 2:24:35.040]  They asked me to facilitate a bribe for her,
[2:24:35.040 --> 2:24:38.040]  an $18 million bribe from another government.
[2:24:38.040 --> 2:24:41.040]  The bag man from that other government was,
[2:24:41.040 --> 2:24:44.040]  I was to befriend, and I was to get that person
[2:24:44.040 --> 2:24:46.040]  10 minutes alone in a room with Hillary Clinton.
[2:24:46.040 --> 2:24:47.040]  I did.
[2:24:47.040 --> 2:24:49.040]  In 2016, Hillary Clinton was in this town,
[2:24:49.040 --> 2:24:51.040]  and she met in a way that was kept off her schedule.
[2:24:51.040 --> 2:24:54.040]  She accepted an $18 million bribe.
[2:24:54.040 --> 2:24:56.040]  But General Barr knows this.
[2:24:56.040 --> 2:24:57.040]  This is the derm.
[2:24:57.040 --> 2:24:59.040]  This was what is behind it all.
[2:24:59.040 --> 2:25:02.040]  And I'll even tell you, I'm going to drop one more thing.
[2:25:02.040 --> 2:25:05.040]  I've been waiting to say this publicly,
[2:25:05.040 --> 2:25:07.040]  and this is what really happened.
[2:25:07.040 --> 2:25:09.040]  I will tell you, if you hear this,
[2:25:09.040 --> 2:25:11.040]  and you hear me 90 seconds,
[2:25:11.040 --> 2:25:13.040]  your viewers will understand what's happened
[2:25:13.040 --> 2:25:14.040]  in the last five years in America.
[2:25:14.040 --> 2:25:16.040]  I've been waiting to say this on mainstream TV,
[2:25:16.040 --> 2:25:18.040]  and they will not have me back,
[2:25:18.040 --> 2:25:20.040]  because once they understood what this was about,
[2:25:20.040 --> 2:25:22.040]  I had Hillary Clinton.
[2:25:22.040 --> 2:25:23.040]  I caused Hillary Clinton.
[2:25:23.040 --> 2:25:25.040]  I facilitated a bribe,
[2:25:25.040 --> 2:25:27.040]  and she took a second bribe for $18 million,
[2:25:27.040 --> 2:25:30.040]  and I worked with the FBI as I did that.
[2:25:30.040 --> 2:25:33.040]  They're deeply involved in this.
[2:25:33.040 --> 2:25:35.040]  They came to me three days later
[2:25:35.040 --> 2:25:37.040]  and told me I had to forget about it,
[2:25:37.040 --> 2:25:39.040]  and forget that it ever happened.
[2:25:39.040 --> 2:25:40.040]  And I said, what are you talking about?
[2:25:40.040 --> 2:25:41.040]  And they gave me one excuse.
[2:25:41.040 --> 2:25:45.040]  They said, you are, Hillary's going to win,
[2:25:45.040 --> 2:25:46.040]  and it's been determined.
[2:25:46.040 --> 2:25:48.040]  It's been decided upstairs.
[2:25:48.040 --> 2:25:50.040]  Nothing's going to be able to stop that now.
[2:25:50.040 --> 2:25:51.040]  So she's going to win,
[2:25:51.040 --> 2:25:53.040]  and she's going to send her people over to the FBI
[2:25:53.040 --> 2:25:55.040]  and ask who was part of investigating Hillary,
[2:25:55.040 --> 2:25:58.040]  and any of us who were part of it are going to be destroyed,
[2:25:58.040 --> 2:26:00.040]  and that includes you too, Patrick.
[2:26:00.040 --> 2:26:03.040]  And so this mission has been scrubbed from the highest level.
[2:26:03.040 --> 2:26:06.040]  And I thought about that,
[2:26:06.040 --> 2:26:08.040]  and I said, yes, sir.
[2:26:08.040 --> 2:26:10.040]  But two or three weeks later,
[2:26:10.040 --> 2:26:13.040]  I was back with three federal agents this time.
[2:26:13.040 --> 2:26:15.040]  Three federal agents.
[2:26:15.040 --> 2:26:17.040]  And I let them know that wasn't sitting,
[2:26:17.040 --> 2:26:20.040]  and this is in Salt Lake City, Utah,
[2:26:20.040 --> 2:26:22.040]  that that wasn't sitting well with me.
[2:26:22.040 --> 2:26:25.040]  And I'd like to know why you had a year with me.
[2:26:25.040 --> 2:26:29.040]  All right, Patrick N. Byrne, who did found Overstock,
[2:26:29.040 --> 2:26:30.040]  a lot of other big companies,
[2:26:30.040 --> 2:26:32.040]  successful guy been on the show before,
[2:26:32.040 --> 2:26:34.040]  been dead on about it being election fraud,
[2:26:34.040 --> 2:26:36.040]  not voter fraud.
[2:26:36.040 --> 2:26:38.040]  I had a chance to be at the same big event with him
[2:26:38.040 --> 2:26:40.040]  at the Jericho event this last Saturday in D.C.
[2:26:40.040 --> 2:26:42.040]  He's here with us now on short notice
[2:26:42.040 --> 2:26:45.040]  at Patrick Byrne on Twitter, deepcapture.com.
[2:26:45.040 --> 2:26:48.040]  Thank you so much for bringing this out.
[2:26:48.040 --> 2:26:49.040]  I believe your story.
[2:26:49.040 --> 2:26:51.040]  I know there were a lot of stings on Hillary.
[2:26:51.040 --> 2:26:52.040]  She was very arrogant.
[2:26:52.040 --> 2:26:54.040]  She was taking over, what, $2 billion
[2:26:54.040 --> 2:26:56.040]  from different governments, individuals,
[2:26:56.040 --> 2:26:57.040]  anybody that would give her money.
[2:26:57.040 --> 2:26:58.040]  She'd give them access.
[2:26:58.040 --> 2:27:00.040]  That's what the email server shows.
[2:27:00.040 --> 2:27:02.040]  I know the Southern District has been investigating her.
[2:27:02.040 --> 2:27:04.040]  I know they've been investigating Hunter.
[2:27:04.040 --> 2:27:05.040]  When you came out and said this,
[2:27:05.040 --> 2:27:07.040]  and I saw the video yesterday,
[2:27:07.040 --> 2:27:08.040]  I said, that's the same stuff.
[2:27:08.040 --> 2:27:11.040]  I got told that there were successful stings on Hillary,
[2:27:11.040 --> 2:27:13.040]  but then when they thought she was going to win,
[2:27:13.040 --> 2:27:14.040]  that all got scrubbed,
[2:27:14.040 --> 2:27:16.040]  and that the Justice Department
[2:27:16.040 --> 2:27:18.040]  has all that info and has been protecting her.
[2:27:18.040 --> 2:27:19.040]  So thanks for joining us.
[2:27:19.040 --> 2:27:21.040]  You've got the floor here to give us the latest
[2:27:21.040 --> 2:27:22.040]  and give us more details,
[2:27:22.040 --> 2:27:25.040]  not in that little two-minute piece.
[2:27:25.040 --> 2:27:26.040]  Okay, Alex.
[2:27:26.040 --> 2:27:28.040]  Well, thank you for having me on again.
[2:27:28.040 --> 2:27:30.040]  And yes, I did run into you backstage
[2:27:30.040 --> 2:27:34.040]  on one of those events this weekend.
[2:27:34.040 --> 2:27:36.040]  I wondered, as you were playing that, why have me on?
[2:27:36.040 --> 2:27:37.040]  You just play it.
[2:27:37.040 --> 2:27:38.040]  I told the story on another show,
[2:27:38.040 --> 2:27:39.040]  but I'll give you some more detail.
[2:27:39.040 --> 2:27:40.040]  This is true.
[2:27:40.040 --> 2:27:43.040]  By the way, I'm in an incredibly precarious situation.
[2:27:43.040 --> 2:27:44.040]  Well, I've already...
[2:27:44.040 --> 2:27:46.040]  No, I want you to know why you did it.
[2:27:46.040 --> 2:27:47.040]  I have a good idea.
[2:27:47.040 --> 2:27:48.040]  The company's in trouble.
[2:27:48.040 --> 2:27:50.040]  It's time for us all to give our maximum.
[2:27:50.040 --> 2:27:52.040]  Yeah, I mean the hell with it.
[2:27:52.040 --> 2:27:55.040]  I've been getting myself an ulcer for two years,
[2:27:55.040 --> 2:27:56.040]  wanting to come out,
[2:27:56.040 --> 2:27:58.040]  but being told, trust the process,
[2:27:58.040 --> 2:28:00.040]  trust the process, trust the process.
[2:28:00.040 --> 2:28:02.040]  About a year ago,
[2:28:02.040 --> 2:28:05.040]  there was a conversation or a communication
[2:28:05.040 --> 2:28:08.040]  between myself and the powers that be
[2:28:08.040 --> 2:28:11.040]  that said, I am not comfortable being part of a cover-up.
[2:28:11.040 --> 2:28:15.040]  And they said, you'd wait after the election,
[2:28:15.040 --> 2:28:16.040]  after the election,
[2:28:16.040 --> 2:28:17.040]  you can say whatever the hell you want to say,
[2:28:17.040 --> 2:28:18.040]  tell the whole story.
[2:28:18.040 --> 2:28:20.040]  So I waited till the election,
[2:28:20.040 --> 2:28:23.040]  and I couldn't live with myself
[2:28:23.040 --> 2:28:24.040]  if I'm not coming out about it now.
[2:28:24.040 --> 2:28:26.040]  By the way, what I'm telling you
[2:28:26.040 --> 2:28:29.040]  is the second of four bombshells.
[2:28:29.040 --> 2:28:31.040]  The first bombshell was the stuff about Maria Boutina.
[2:28:31.040 --> 2:28:33.040]  I came out with it a year ago.
[2:28:33.040 --> 2:28:35.040]  The second bombshell is what I'm telling you now.
[2:28:35.040 --> 2:28:37.040]  There's two more bigger ones to come.
[2:28:37.040 --> 2:28:39.040]  I'm just not sharing them yet.
[2:28:39.040 --> 2:28:42.040]  So I was in December,
[2:28:42.040 --> 2:28:45.040]  early December, 2015,
[2:28:45.040 --> 2:28:46.040]  they came to me,
[2:28:46.040 --> 2:28:48.040]  they asked me to set up Hillary and a bribe.
[2:28:48.040 --> 2:28:50.040]  They did this because I had worked with the FBI
[2:28:50.040 --> 2:28:52.040]  rounding up Wall Street.
[2:28:52.040 --> 2:28:54.040]  And if people go back to that fight,
[2:28:54.040 --> 2:28:57.040]  I was in a very famous fight, 05 to 08 with Wall Street.
[2:28:57.040 --> 2:28:59.040]  And there was a man who went on Fox,
[2:28:59.040 --> 2:29:01.040]  U.S. attorney, who later confirmed that,
[2:29:01.040 --> 2:29:03.040]  yes, I came in with a whole bunch of information
[2:29:03.040 --> 2:29:05.040]  and it triggered a federal investigation
[2:29:05.040 --> 2:29:08.040]  that became this big thing that put 200 people in jail.
[2:29:08.040 --> 2:29:10.040]  And if you look at the steel,
[2:29:10.040 --> 2:29:12.040]  anyway, that's up on Deep Capture.
[2:29:12.040 --> 2:29:15.040]  A U.S. attorney said that on Fox a year ago.
[2:29:15.040 --> 2:29:17.040]  So that part of the story has been confirmed.
[2:29:17.040 --> 2:29:22.040]  So they came back and they said in December of 2015,
[2:29:22.040 --> 2:29:24.040]  we need you, this is word for word.
[2:29:24.040 --> 2:29:26.040]  I have something called an idetic memory.
[2:29:26.040 --> 2:29:28.040]  When I tell you something that's word for word,
[2:29:28.040 --> 2:29:29.040]  it's word for word.
[2:29:29.040 --> 2:29:31.040]  They came back and said, this part,
[2:29:31.040 --> 2:29:34.040]  the FBI is asking for your help again.
[2:29:34.040 --> 2:29:39.040]  There are two groups investigating the FBI,
[2:29:39.040 --> 2:29:42.040]  in the FBI investigating Hillary Clinton, Patrick.
[2:29:42.040 --> 2:29:45.040]  One is the email group and we know that's a whitewash,
[2:29:45.040 --> 2:29:47.040]  but there's a group in New York
[2:29:47.040 --> 2:29:50.040]  who really wants to put her ass and stir.
[2:29:50.040 --> 2:29:53.040]  They're going after financials, the Clinton financials.
[2:29:53.040 --> 2:29:57.040]  Comey has been blocking them from acting,
[2:29:57.040 --> 2:30:00.040]  saying there wasn't enough to justify them going aggressive
[2:30:00.040 --> 2:30:02.040]  in their investigative techniques.
[2:30:02.040 --> 2:30:05.040]  Now, this is what they explained to me.
[2:30:05.040 --> 2:30:06.040]  I'm breaking out of word for word.
[2:30:06.040 --> 2:30:08.040]  They then explained to me the legal theory of a sting.
[2:30:08.040 --> 2:30:09.040]  Do you mind if I take it?
[2:30:09.040 --> 2:30:11.040]  Do I walk you through this and much more detail?
[2:30:11.040 --> 2:30:12.040]  We know you've got a lot more to tell.
[2:30:12.040 --> 2:30:13.040]  That's what we got here.
[2:30:13.040 --> 2:30:14.040]  Go ahead.
[2:30:14.040 --> 2:30:16.040]  So I'm going to go through it in much more detail
[2:30:16.040 --> 2:30:18.040]  than I did on that other report.
[2:30:18.040 --> 2:30:20.040]  That other interview you just clipped from.
[2:30:20.040 --> 2:30:23.040]  They explained to me the legal theory of a sting.
[2:30:23.040 --> 2:30:25.040]  They said to look at cop, undercover cop,
[2:30:25.040 --> 2:30:27.040]  can't just walk up to a stranger and say,
[2:30:27.040 --> 2:30:29.040]  hey, you want to buy a bag of cocaine.
[2:30:29.040 --> 2:30:31.040]  Because you might not have been out to buy cocaine.
[2:30:31.040 --> 2:30:33.040]  They can't just go around creating crimes.
[2:30:33.040 --> 2:30:37.040]  So the prosecutor needs to establish that you already
[2:30:37.040 --> 2:30:39.040]  had a prior disposition.
[2:30:39.040 --> 2:30:42.040]  And they do that by establishing that proving you
[2:30:42.040 --> 2:30:44.040]  committed one or more predicate acts.
[2:30:44.040 --> 2:30:45.040]  And these are all legal terms.
[2:30:45.040 --> 2:30:46.040]  And they explain this all to me.
[2:30:46.040 --> 2:30:47.040]  And it comes important later.
[2:30:47.040 --> 2:30:50.040]  So I'm walking you in detail.
[2:30:50.040 --> 2:30:54.040]  So for example, if you pulled over at a street corner,
[2:30:54.040 --> 2:30:56.040]  they need to show you pulled over at an intersection known
[2:30:56.040 --> 2:30:57.040]  for drug distribution.
[2:30:57.040 --> 2:30:58.040]  You put it in park.
[2:30:58.040 --> 2:30:59.040]  You roll down your window.
[2:30:59.040 --> 2:31:02.040]  You call these are all predicate acts that the prosecutor
[2:31:02.040 --> 2:31:05.040]  can later say, you already had the prior disposition
[2:31:05.040 --> 2:31:06.040]  to buy the cocaine.
[2:31:06.040 --> 2:31:08.040]  So when the guy walked up, the undercover cop
[2:31:08.040 --> 2:31:10.040]  walked up and sold you some, it's a good bus.
[2:31:10.040 --> 2:31:11.040]  Sure.
[2:31:11.040 --> 2:31:12.040]  The government's committing the crime
[2:31:12.040 --> 2:31:15.040]  if they initiated and sell you instead of you're already
[2:31:15.040 --> 2:31:17.040]  looking and you were already looking for it already
[2:31:17.040 --> 2:31:19.040]  to commit the crime, it's premeditated.
[2:31:19.040 --> 2:31:21.040]  And so they knew she was out selling influence,
[2:31:21.040 --> 2:31:23.040]  selling billions of dollars of it.
[2:31:23.040 --> 2:31:25.040]  So they needed to have it be a separate third party
[2:31:25.040 --> 2:31:27.040]  and show that she was coming to a meeting wanting
[2:31:27.040 --> 2:31:28.040]  to be bought off.
[2:31:28.040 --> 2:31:29.040]  Well, close.
[2:31:29.040 --> 2:31:32.040]  They were saying that Comey had been saying up to that point
[2:31:32.040 --> 2:31:36.040]  there was not enough predicate information to justify a sting.
[2:31:36.040 --> 2:31:40.040]  However, Patrick, they told me information has come in
[2:31:40.040 --> 2:31:41.040]  and Hillers accepted a bribe.
[2:31:41.040 --> 2:31:44.040]  She took a $20 million bribe from Turkey.
[2:31:44.040 --> 2:31:48.040]  And that information has come in and the group in New York
[2:31:48.040 --> 2:31:54.040]  has now used that as leverage to force Comey to sign off
[2:31:54.040 --> 2:31:57.040]  on a sting and he has approved a sting and the New York group
[2:31:57.040 --> 2:31:59.040]  is sending to you for you to help.
[2:31:59.040 --> 2:32:01.040]  And you're going to facilitate a bribe.
[2:32:01.040 --> 2:32:05.040]  And there's another government that was known to want
[2:32:05.040 --> 2:32:07.040]  to bribe Hillary $18 million.
[2:32:07.040 --> 2:32:09.040]  You're going to befriend that government.
[2:32:09.040 --> 2:32:11.040]  You're going to befriend the bag man in that government.
[2:32:11.040 --> 2:32:14.040]  And somewhere, and it's going to happen in the next two months,
[2:32:14.040 --> 2:32:16.040]  Patrick, somewhere there's going to be a room.
[2:32:16.040 --> 2:32:19.040]  And Hillary Clinton walks into that room and the bag man's
[2:32:19.040 --> 2:32:20.040]  in that room.
[2:32:20.040 --> 2:32:21.040]  Sure.
[2:32:21.040 --> 2:32:23.040]  It's like all the countless FBI stings we've seen.
[2:32:23.040 --> 2:32:24.040]  It's very formulaic.
[2:32:24.040 --> 2:32:26.040]  Well, it was a very specific thing they told me
[2:32:26.040 --> 2:32:27.040]  that there's going to be a room.
[2:32:27.040 --> 2:32:29.040]  She's going to come in for 10 minutes.
[2:32:29.040 --> 2:32:30.040]  The bag man's going to be in for 10 minutes.
[2:32:30.040 --> 2:32:32.040]  They're going to be there alone.
[2:32:32.040 --> 2:32:33.040]  And that's it.
[2:32:33.040 --> 2:32:34.040]  That's your assignment.
[2:32:34.040 --> 2:32:37.040]  And so they gave me that and sort of up to me how to create
[2:32:37.040 --> 2:32:38.040]  that event.
[2:32:38.040 --> 2:32:39.040]  So it's all up to me.
[2:32:39.040 --> 2:32:41.040]  And I told them, look, to make that happen,
[2:32:41.040 --> 2:32:43.040]  there's going to be some bribing and stuff.
[2:32:43.040 --> 2:32:47.040]  And I need something called an acts otherwise illegal letter,
[2:32:47.040 --> 2:32:49.040]  which is a letter they can give you when they're asking you
[2:32:49.040 --> 2:32:51.040]  to do something like this, like get involved in a federal
[2:32:51.040 --> 2:32:53.040]  election and bribe someone.
[2:32:53.040 --> 2:32:57.040]  And they went back and I see the time I'll finish this in 45
[2:32:57.040 --> 2:32:59.040]  seconds and then we'll continue the story.
[2:32:59.040 --> 2:33:00.040]  I'll finish this part.
[2:33:00.040 --> 2:33:02.040]  They said, we'll have to go back to the office and discuss it.
[2:33:02.040 --> 2:33:05.040]  They came back in two days and said word for word.
[2:33:05.040 --> 2:33:08.040]  Now we've been told to tell you we can't give you a letter.
[2:33:08.040 --> 2:33:11.040]  But if you'll come to DC, the director says you can be shown
[2:33:11.040 --> 2:33:12.040]  a letter.
[2:33:12.040 --> 2:33:15.040]  I said, oh, this is coming from director Comey and two federal
[2:33:15.040 --> 2:33:21.040]  agents looked me in the eye and said, and I said, oh, this
[2:33:21.040 --> 2:33:23.040]  is coming from director Comey and the president.
[2:33:23.040 --> 2:33:28.040]  And two federal agents looked me in the eye and said, and I said,
[2:33:28.040 --> 2:33:31.040]  well, you can tell director Comey and president Obama that
[2:33:31.040 --> 2:33:33.040]  from them is good enough for me.
[2:33:33.040 --> 2:33:35.040]  Consider Hillary bribed.
[2:33:35.040 --> 2:33:36.040]  You'll be right back.
[2:33:36.040 --> 2:33:37.040]  Oh, so it's Obama trying.
[2:33:37.040 --> 2:33:38.040]  This one is so big.
[2:33:38.040 --> 2:33:41.040]  And we know the Obamas and the Clintons don't like each other.
[2:33:41.040 --> 2:33:43.040]  Stay with us.
[2:33:43.040 --> 2:33:47.040]  The US Postal Service tells info wars that as long as you get
[2:33:47.040 --> 2:33:50.040]  your order in by December 18th, we're able to ship it out
[2:33:50.040 --> 2:33:51.040]  by that date.
[2:33:51.040 --> 2:33:54.040]  You will get it anywhere in the United States before Christmas.
[2:33:54.040 --> 2:33:55.040]  But listen, don't wait.

[2:34:03.040 --> 2:34:06.040]  but this country's history, you have invested in info wars.
[2:34:06.040 --> 2:34:08.040]  You prayed for us.
[2:34:08.040 --> 2:34:09.040]  You've spread the word.
[2:34:09.040 --> 2:34:12.040]  You've bought the products and you've gotten the benefits of the
[2:34:12.040 --> 2:34:15.040]  information warfare of the truth in the fight against the
[2:34:15.040 --> 2:34:16.040]  globalist.
[2:34:16.040 --> 2:34:19.040]  But now is the time to redouble all our efforts and praying
[2:34:19.040 --> 2:34:22.040]  for a great awakening, which is starting to happen and spreading
[2:34:22.040 --> 2:34:26.040]  the word about info wars.com, news wars.com, and band.video.
[2:34:26.040 --> 2:34:30.040]  And at the very same time, buying amazing products at
[2:34:30.040 --> 2:34:31.040]  infowarstore.com.
[2:34:31.040 --> 2:34:34.040]  They have some of the biggest sales, if not the biggest of the
[2:34:34.040 --> 2:34:36.040]  year, certainly on some items, the biggest sales of the year
[2:34:36.040 --> 2:34:39.040]  on new pharmaceuticals, you name it, at infowarstore.com.
[2:34:39.040 --> 2:34:40.040]  So thanks for your support.
[2:34:40.040 --> 2:34:43.040]  Get those orders in and God bless.
[2:34:43.040 --> 2:34:45.040]  The project for world government developed by the British
[2:34:45.040 --> 2:34:48.040]  Empire via Cecil Rhodes, then picked up by the Rockefeller
[2:34:48.040 --> 2:34:52.040]  family and the major robber barons, the planet by the 1920s, is
[2:34:52.040 --> 2:34:54.040]  all about corporate global governance.
[2:34:54.040 --> 2:34:55.040]  And now you're seeing it.
[2:34:55.040 --> 2:34:57.040]  It's not just the blue states, the blue cities, the
[2:34:57.040 --> 2:35:00.040]  communist and socialist nations all working in unison under
[2:35:00.040 --> 2:35:04.040]  UN control to establish a medical planetary dictatorship.
[2:35:04.040 --> 2:35:08.040]  At the core of it is the Fortune 100 corporations themselves
[2:35:08.040 --> 2:35:12.040]  funded by a handful of private central banking families, the
[2:35:12.040 --> 2:35:15.040]  Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, the Dutch and British royalty,
[2:35:15.040 --> 2:35:16.040]  being at the very heart of that.
[2:35:16.040 --> 2:35:19.040]  Then you learn the Dutch and British royalty aren't even Dutch
[2:35:19.040 --> 2:35:22.040]  or British at the same time, but they go back to the
[2:35:22.040 --> 2:35:26.040]  literal count Dracula and the wars in between Christendom
[2:35:26.040 --> 2:35:27.040]  and Islam.
[2:35:27.040 --> 2:35:31.040]  Those that don't know history really are doomed to repeat it.
[2:35:31.040 --> 2:35:34.040]  They're involved in poting the world economy.
[2:35:34.040 --> 2:35:36.040]  That's what the social distancing the master all about.
[2:35:36.040 --> 2:35:39.040]  It's about bankrupting local small businesses and those that
[2:35:39.040 --> 2:35:43.040]  comply or comply with your own destruction, wake up.
[2:35:43.040 --> 2:35:44.040]  Hey Steve, how you doing?
[2:35:44.040 --> 2:35:49.040]  Hey Alex, oh my God, long time listener, first time caller.
[2:35:49.040 --> 2:35:52.040]  Look, in January 2016, I went in a hospital.
[2:35:52.040 --> 2:35:55.040]  I went to VA hospital out here in Boise and I was in there until
[2:35:55.040 --> 2:35:58.040]  June and I kept hearing Dr. Group and all you guys talking
[2:35:58.040 --> 2:35:59.040]  about living defense.
[2:35:59.040 --> 2:36:01.040]  Let me tell you something, man.
[2:36:01.040 --> 2:36:05.040]  I had an internal digestive problem and I stuck with it for
[2:36:05.040 --> 2:36:08.040]  about five or six years and the doctors, they tried every test.
[2:36:08.040 --> 2:36:10.040]  Nobody could figure out what it is.
[2:36:10.040 --> 2:36:13.040]  And then every day when I kept hearing you and Dr. Group and
[2:36:13.040 --> 2:36:15.040]  those commercials, I said, you know what, I'm going to get me
[2:36:15.040 --> 2:36:17.040]  some of that freaking living defense.
[2:36:17.040 --> 2:36:19.040]  Now, I wasn't supposed to have any nutritional stuff.
[2:36:19.040 --> 2:36:20.040]  They don't want you to have it.
[2:36:20.040 --> 2:36:22.040]  But I ordered it, had it shipped to me.
[2:36:22.040 --> 2:36:23.040]  I got it.
[2:36:23.040 --> 2:36:24.040]  I hid it from the nurses.
[2:36:24.040 --> 2:36:25.040]  I started taking it.
[2:36:25.040 --> 2:36:27.040]  Man, that stuff changed my life.
[2:36:27.040 --> 2:36:28.040]  It saved my life.
[2:36:28.040 --> 2:36:31.040]  If there's any veteran out there, I don't care if you've traveled
[2:36:31.040 --> 2:36:35.040]  or anybody's traveled overseas, you absolutely owe it to yourself
[2:36:35.040 --> 2:36:38.040]  to get two bottles of that living defense.
[2:36:38.040 --> 2:36:41.040]  It's true folks, we don't sell anything unless it's the highest
[2:36:41.040 --> 2:36:44.040]  quality and living defense is over the top good.
[2:36:44.040 --> 2:36:47.040]  Fox has betrayed President Trump as I predicted they would.
[2:36:47.040 --> 2:36:50.040]  They've always been part of the establishment and it's only
[2:36:50.040 --> 2:36:51.040]  going to get worse.
[2:36:51.040 --> 2:36:54.040]  If they're able to keep Trump from rightfully taking office
[2:36:54.040 --> 2:36:58.040]  for a second term on January 20th, the system is going to drop
[2:36:58.040 --> 2:37:01.040]  the hammer harder than ever on this republic.
[2:37:01.040 --> 2:37:03.040]  They are going to explode gas prices.
[2:37:03.040 --> 2:37:05.040]  They're going to shut down our coal power plants.
[2:37:05.040 --> 2:37:07.040]  They're going to cut off the energy source to U.S.
[2:37:07.040 --> 2:37:10.040]  So it's impossible for factories to move back here.
[2:37:10.040 --> 2:37:12.040]  This is economic domination.
[2:37:12.040 --> 2:37:13.040]  This is economic war.
[2:37:13.040 --> 2:37:14.040]  We are being consolidated.
[2:37:14.040 --> 2:37:15.040]  We are being taken over.
[2:37:15.040 --> 2:37:18.040]  The Democrats aren't mismanaging their blue cities and states.
[2:37:18.040 --> 2:37:22.040]  They're consolidating power and control to bankrupt the population
[2:37:22.040 --> 2:37:25.040]  and bring them absolutely to heal and then consolidate ownership
[2:37:25.040 --> 2:37:28.040]  of all the infrastructure and property.
[2:37:28.040 --> 2:37:30.040]  This is a monopolistic takeover.
[2:37:30.040 --> 2:37:31.040]  That's what the great reset is.
[2:37:31.040 --> 2:37:34.040]  Klaus Schwab and these other criminals admit it.
[2:37:34.040 --> 2:37:36.040]  That's what social distancing is.
[2:37:36.040 --> 2:37:39.040]  So your business is only at 25% for several more years.
[2:37:39.040 --> 2:37:41.040]  No small businesses will be there.
[2:37:41.040 --> 2:37:42.040]  This is a master plan.
[2:37:42.040 --> 2:37:43.040]  Say no.
[2:37:46.040 --> 2:37:49.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:37:49.040 --> 2:38:14.040]  Well, we are riders on the storm, and the storm is populism,
[2:38:14.040 --> 2:38:18.040]  waking up to globalism, and huge political movements of freedom exploding.
[2:38:18.040 --> 2:38:21.080]  Now, they're openly stealing this election.
[2:38:21.080 --> 2:38:24.520]  A lot of people are really getting angry, and you see Trump releasing a lot of classified
[2:38:24.520 --> 2:38:28.400]  info and a lot of serious information coming out about the Chinese communists and about
[2:38:28.400 --> 2:38:32.760]  the Russians and about the Bidens and very damning stuff.
[2:38:32.760 --> 2:38:38.800]  People ask me, do I believe Dr. Patrick M. Byrne, and I absolutely do believe him because
[2:38:38.800 --> 2:38:45.640]  I know the state police and I know New York police and I know good FBI people that have
[2:38:45.640 --> 2:38:50.000]  been very, very, and secret service that have never given us anything but really accurate
[2:38:50.000 --> 2:38:51.500]  information.
[2:38:51.500 --> 2:38:54.520]  And it's exactly how he's saying it, though, like, hey, you need to look over here.
[2:38:54.520 --> 2:38:55.520]  No, no.
[2:38:55.520 --> 2:38:56.520]  Yeah, no.
[2:38:56.520 --> 2:38:57.520]  You need to go do this.
[2:38:57.520 --> 2:38:58.520]  You need to go do that.
[2:38:58.520 --> 2:38:59.520]  And then, like, I get a call.
[2:38:59.520 --> 2:39:00.520]  Like, one letter.
[2:39:00.520 --> 2:39:01.520]  You're not doing that.
[2:39:01.520 --> 2:39:02.520]  No, no, no.
[2:39:02.520 --> 2:39:03.520]  You don't do this.
[2:39:03.520 --> 2:39:04.520]  You do that.
[2:39:04.520 --> 2:39:06.520]  And then it was good info, like Hillary falling down and, you know, the fact that they had
[2:39:06.520 --> 2:39:07.520]  all these stings on her.
[2:39:07.520 --> 2:39:08.520]  I've heard this.
[2:39:08.520 --> 2:39:11.320]  I just didn't hear it was Patrick M. Byrne.
[2:39:11.320 --> 2:39:15.560]  So, Patrick, you're continuing here where they're like, the FBI, this is back under
[2:39:15.560 --> 2:39:18.360]  Obama, staying against Hillary.
[2:39:18.360 --> 2:39:23.880]  Why would he be wanting to do that right before the election in 2016, this gets into a lot
[2:39:23.880 --> 2:39:24.880]  of intrigue.
[2:39:24.880 --> 2:39:26.560]  I'll get you into that.
[2:39:26.560 --> 2:39:29.440]  Before I go on, I want to first say one thing, Alex.
[2:39:29.440 --> 2:39:31.400]  It's thank you for having me on your show.
[2:39:31.400 --> 2:39:34.400]  And I must confess, I did not listen to you over the years.
[2:39:34.400 --> 2:39:38.720]  I heard wacky things and didn't pay attention.
[2:39:38.720 --> 2:39:42.400]  And but what I've realized is the mainstream press that when this is when all when the
[2:39:42.400 --> 2:39:45.840]  dust settles, everyone's going to see the mainstream press.
[2:39:45.840 --> 2:39:49.040]  They're the cooks that they're, they're trying to, they're part of this.
[2:39:49.040 --> 2:39:53.040]  They're trying to keep people from understanding what they're seeing in front of them.
[2:39:53.040 --> 2:39:54.600]  And good for you.
[2:39:54.600 --> 2:39:55.600]  Good.
[2:39:55.600 --> 2:39:56.600]  So, respect.
[2:39:56.600 --> 2:39:57.600]  I'm trying to say it gracefully.
[2:39:57.600 --> 2:39:59.760]  I don't know about your aspirinist respect.
[2:39:59.760 --> 2:40:01.280]  The only thing is I want to be clear.
[2:40:01.280 --> 2:40:05.120]  I have nothing to do with white, anything white, identitarianism.
[2:40:05.120 --> 2:40:06.680]  I issue anything racist.
[2:40:06.680 --> 2:40:08.080]  I assume you're on the same.
[2:40:08.080 --> 2:40:09.080]  Oh, that's the man.
[2:40:09.080 --> 2:40:10.600]  Well, I mean, the media says Trump's a Nazi.
[2:40:10.600 --> 2:40:12.000]  I wouldn't support Trump if he was.
[2:40:12.000 --> 2:40:13.200]  It's all pure crap.
[2:40:13.200 --> 2:40:16.600]  They said I'm anti-Semitic because I don't want globalism.
[2:40:16.600 --> 2:40:17.960]  Globalism is about world government.
[2:40:17.960 --> 2:40:19.480]  The chai cons are globalism.
[2:40:19.480 --> 2:40:22.600]  I'm not against the Chinese people, but I'm against the Chinese communists.
[2:40:22.600 --> 2:40:25.560]  So I think we're on the same, same boat here.
[2:40:25.560 --> 2:40:26.560]  You know, I speak Chinese.
[2:40:26.560 --> 2:40:29.640]  I'd like to talk about China when I'm done the Hillary Bob story.
[2:40:29.640 --> 2:40:34.040]  I, I'm a long, I'm not an old China hand, but I was once a young China hand and I can
[2:40:34.040 --> 2:40:35.880]  tell you what's going on.
[2:40:35.880 --> 2:40:41.720]  And if, if you are anyway, uh, so what happened was, where was I with Hillary?
[2:40:41.720 --> 2:40:46.640]  The FBI was saying it went all the way up to Obama was, was greenlighting a sting.
[2:40:46.640 --> 2:40:47.640]  And they did this thing.
[2:40:47.640 --> 2:40:48.640]  And I said, great.
[2:40:48.640 --> 2:40:49.640]  Okay.
[2:40:49.640 --> 2:40:54.640]  So I'm going to skip a bunch of stuff, but I can tell you that six weeks later in this
[2:40:54.640 --> 2:41:01.800]  town in the middle of January, there was a moment where, where Hillary Clinton and
[2:41:01.800 --> 2:41:05.480]  I, I will walk you through more detail than I did on the other show, but I'm not going
[2:41:05.480 --> 2:41:08.840]  to, I'm not going to tell you everything I'm not pretending to tell you why you're doing
[2:41:08.840 --> 2:41:09.840]  it now and where it's going.
[2:41:09.840 --> 2:41:11.720]  I mean, give us a big picture first.
[2:41:11.720 --> 2:41:14.840]  Obviously you see this, this theft of the election, your pitch, you've been wanting
[2:41:14.840 --> 2:41:15.840]  to tell us for years.
[2:41:15.840 --> 2:41:16.840]  Yeah.
[2:41:16.840 --> 2:41:17.840]  This is a coup.
[2:41:17.840 --> 2:41:19.960]  The coup all began five years ago.
[2:41:19.960 --> 2:41:25.360]  This is all a soft, this is all a coup from Barack Obama against Hillary Clinton.
[2:41:25.360 --> 2:41:31.000]  Trump won in a fluke or for some other reasons we can go into and it morphed into the Russian
[2:41:31.000 --> 2:41:32.160]  collusion delusion.
[2:41:32.160 --> 2:41:39.320]  And I say this as the guy they had bribing Hillary Clinton and romancing Maria butina.
[2:41:39.320 --> 2:41:43.480]  So I probably more inside this issue than anyone you can think of.
[2:41:43.480 --> 2:41:45.080]  So I know what I'm talking about.
[2:41:45.080 --> 2:41:47.320]  So let me go back to this.
[2:41:47.320 --> 2:41:50.800]  If you wanted me to come back and dig into the details of how this and that were done,
[2:41:50.800 --> 2:41:51.800]  I'll give you a little bit more.
[2:41:51.800 --> 2:41:55.840]  But the point is, it pulled off six weeks later, it happened.
[2:41:55.840 --> 2:42:01.040]  And I've been shown this spring a document that a document from a bank that would be
[2:42:01.040 --> 2:42:06.520]  say consistent with what I'm with the, the, with what I'll call broad number two.
[2:42:06.520 --> 2:42:11.200]  The broad number one was 20 million bucks, Turkey, broad number two, $18 million for
[2:42:11.200 --> 2:42:15.840]  my bank in a different country, not related to Turkey, different country all together
[2:42:15.840 --> 2:42:19.000]  and not a country I've ever been to.
[2:42:19.000 --> 2:42:22.800]  But anyway, so, so what, or that I had ever been to.
[2:42:22.800 --> 2:42:24.480]  So it's been anyway.
[2:42:24.480 --> 2:42:30.840]  So she, she, I can't my, I was not in the room when it happened, but everything fell
[2:42:30.840 --> 2:42:31.840]  into place.
[2:42:31.840 --> 2:42:35.720]  I met with the agents three days later expecting them to confirm, okay, everything pulled off
[2:42:35.720 --> 2:42:36.720]  as expected.
[2:42:36.720 --> 2:42:40.520]  Instead, the agent said, Patrick, there were two agents and they, and they're very good
[2:42:40.520 --> 2:42:41.520]  guys.
[2:42:41.520 --> 2:42:46.440]  And I got to tell you, I do not mean to disperse the FBI, the FBI, we can build, we can take
[2:42:46.440 --> 2:42:51.000]  the FBI that we have as citizens and create a functioning FBI out of it.
[2:42:51.000 --> 2:42:55.440]  But there's a real problem, systemic problem at the top, at the top of a lot of our agencies.
[2:42:55.440 --> 2:42:58.560]  And I can even tell you, we can go into how that came about.
[2:42:58.560 --> 2:42:59.560]  It's called ram specking.
[2:42:59.560 --> 2:43:04.880]  It's the turning of political appointees into people who don't rise to the top from
[2:43:04.880 --> 2:43:08.800]  within, but political, I mean, they brought the operatives and they control the top.
[2:43:08.800 --> 2:43:09.800]  That's classic.
[2:43:09.800 --> 2:43:10.800]  Yeah.
[2:43:10.800 --> 2:43:14.240]  But after they become political operatives, it used to be taboo that you ever took a job
[2:43:14.240 --> 2:43:17.640]  within the department about 30, 40 years ago, that changed.
[2:43:17.640 --> 2:43:22.240]  And now there's a bunch of political appointees who burrowed into the bureaucracy and they're
[2:43:22.240 --> 2:43:23.240]  the problem.
[2:43:23.240 --> 2:43:24.720]  Both parties, both parties are guilty.
[2:43:24.720 --> 2:43:29.760]  So back to the, let me, I don't want to skip the punchline on all this.
[2:43:29.760 --> 2:43:31.520]  So they told me I needed to forget it.
[2:43:31.520 --> 2:43:32.520]  And I said, why?
[2:43:32.520 --> 2:43:34.640]  And they said, look, it's been decided at the top.
[2:43:34.640 --> 2:43:38.360]  We've realized there's no, nothing's going to stop Hillary Clinton from being president
[2:43:38.360 --> 2:43:39.360]  now.
[2:43:39.360 --> 2:43:43.800]  And the day she's president, she's going to send her men over the FBI for people over
[2:43:43.800 --> 2:43:47.080]  the FBI and ask who is part of investigating Hillary.
[2:43:47.080 --> 2:43:50.720]  And everyone who's part of this, Patrick, we're all going to be destroyed from the top
[2:43:50.720 --> 2:43:51.720]  to the bottom.
[2:43:51.720 --> 2:43:53.160]  And this includes you, Patrick.
[2:43:53.160 --> 2:43:57.760]  So it's been decided at the very top, this mission has been scrubbed and we mean it.
[2:43:57.760 --> 2:44:02.080]  You have to wipe every moment of this from your memory.
[2:44:02.080 --> 2:44:06.680]  And I said, yes, sir, I understand.
[2:44:06.680 --> 2:44:10.120]  And by the truth is deep down, I didn't know why you did it.
[2:44:10.120 --> 2:44:13.960]  So tell us now why, why this is important tied into latest developments and who the
[2:44:13.960 --> 2:44:14.960]  power is.
[2:44:14.960 --> 2:44:15.960]  Okay.
[2:44:15.960 --> 2:44:16.960]  Sorry.
[2:44:16.960 --> 2:44:18.440]  This is, this is, this is the punchline.
[2:44:18.440 --> 2:44:22.200]  And if you hear this, you'll understand what's happened in the last five years.
[2:44:22.200 --> 2:44:25.760]  They, I got back together a few weeks later and said, this isn't sitting right.
[2:44:25.760 --> 2:44:29.080]  And at this point, there were three federal agents present.
[2:44:29.080 --> 2:44:35.280]  And after some hemming and hawing, eventually the following story was expressed to me.
[2:44:35.280 --> 2:44:38.000]  And it runs like this, Patrick, what you need to understand.
[2:44:38.000 --> 2:44:44.720]  So this is late January, 2016, Patrick, what you need to understand is President Obama,
[2:44:44.720 --> 2:44:49.680]  and this is word for word from the really four federal people of different types involved.
[2:44:49.680 --> 2:44:50.680]  And this is word for word.
[2:44:50.680 --> 2:44:54.320]  Patrick, you need to understand that at this point, President Obama has his people across
[2:44:54.320 --> 2:44:58.080]  the federal bureaucracy, but especially in the Department of Justice.
[2:44:58.080 --> 2:45:01.760]  Hillary Clinton is going to be president for eight years and nothing is going to change
[2:45:01.760 --> 2:45:02.760]  that.
[2:45:02.760 --> 2:45:03.760]  But think of it this way.
[2:45:03.760 --> 2:45:09.840]  I think whether it's being a Bunsen burner within the Department of Justice, and on that
[2:45:09.840 --> 2:45:14.600]  Bunsen burner, that information about the two bribes you were part of gathering, that
[2:45:14.600 --> 2:45:16.240]  will be sitting there.
[2:45:16.240 --> 2:45:19.680]  But the hand on the Bunsen burner is going to be one of Barack Obama's people.
[2:45:19.680 --> 2:45:23.880]  If Hillary Clinton is a good girl and defends Obamacare and such, that flame stays low.
[2:45:23.880 --> 2:45:28.640]  If she's a bad girl and gets thinking for herself, that flame gets turned up.
[2:45:28.640 --> 2:45:32.680]  And that way, Barack Obama is going to manage Hillary Clinton for eight years.
[2:45:32.680 --> 2:45:34.720]  That's exactly what the feds are trying to be.
[2:45:34.720 --> 2:45:36.760]  You don't have to turn the burner all the way up.
[2:45:36.760 --> 2:45:37.760]  Don't step on the line.
[2:45:37.760 --> 2:45:38.760]  You don't want to step on this line, Alex.
[2:45:38.760 --> 2:45:39.760]  Okay, so back to the Bunsen burner.
[2:45:39.760 --> 2:45:41.360]  Two or three more sentences.
[2:45:41.360 --> 2:45:47.960]  That way, Barack Obama, for the whole time Hillary Clinton is president, Barack Obama
[2:45:47.960 --> 2:45:52.120]  is going to be managing her, and she's going to step down, and Michelle is going to run.
[2:45:52.120 --> 2:45:54.160]  And Patrick, that's the plan.
[2:45:54.160 --> 2:45:55.160]  Wow.
[2:45:55.160 --> 2:45:57.760]  Say that again, because I did mess up the Bunsen line.
[2:45:57.760 --> 2:45:59.160]  The Bunsen burner can be turned up.
[2:45:59.160 --> 2:46:00.160]  It can be turned down.
[2:46:00.160 --> 2:46:02.040]  It gets down.
[2:46:02.040 --> 2:46:07.120]  And that way, Barack Obama is going to manage Hillary Clinton for the eight years she's
[2:46:07.120 --> 2:46:10.600]  president, then she's going to step down, and Michelle's going to run.
[2:46:10.600 --> 2:46:12.360]  And Patrick, that's the plan.
[2:46:12.360 --> 2:46:13.360]  Wow.
[2:46:13.360 --> 2:46:18.240]  That makes perfect sense with Biden being an Obama literal zombie, and then he steps
[2:46:18.240 --> 2:46:21.920]  down, and then Michelle comes in in four years, or how do you see that?
[2:46:21.920 --> 2:46:24.960]  No, Hillary would be in for eight years.
[2:46:24.960 --> 2:46:25.960]  And then...
[2:46:25.960 --> 2:46:26.960]  No, I'm talking about now.
[2:46:26.960 --> 2:46:27.960]  Now.
[2:46:27.960 --> 2:46:28.960]  Because I'm thinking about the...
[2:46:28.960 --> 2:46:29.960]  Your story is very important.
[2:46:29.960 --> 2:46:30.960]  I believe it.
[2:46:30.960 --> 2:46:31.960]  But how does...
[2:46:31.960 --> 2:46:32.960]  What does that affect the future?
[2:46:32.960 --> 2:46:33.960]  Well, this is all a coup that started there.
[2:46:33.960 --> 2:46:34.960]  This is...
[2:46:34.960 --> 2:46:35.960]  This was...
[2:46:35.960 --> 2:46:37.800]  They were using blackmail.
[2:46:37.800 --> 2:46:41.120]  That's why I went public a year ago and said, this is all political espionage.
[2:46:41.120 --> 2:46:43.280]  That's why I only told the part of the story.
[2:46:43.280 --> 2:46:45.720]  I dated Maria Boutina two times.
[2:46:45.720 --> 2:46:49.960]  And basically, what I went public last year was what I figured out in the first time.
[2:46:49.960 --> 2:46:54.760]  And I said in that Martha McCallum appearance that they asked me to work on something else
[2:46:54.760 --> 2:46:56.640]  had to do with a corrupt federal official.
[2:46:56.640 --> 2:47:00.320]  This is the story I was thinking of, but I didn't want to say it then.
[2:47:00.320 --> 2:47:01.560]  I should have.
[2:47:01.560 --> 2:47:02.560]  But it was that...
[2:47:02.560 --> 2:47:05.200]  So that's where this all started.
[2:47:05.200 --> 2:47:06.200]  They were...
[2:47:06.200 --> 2:47:09.360]  And Barack Obama started a coup on Hillary Clinton.
[2:47:09.360 --> 2:47:13.760]  And the Russian collusion delusion was being set up from the summer of 2015.
[2:47:13.760 --> 2:47:15.880]  John Brennan was working on this.
[2:47:15.880 --> 2:47:20.960]  I think that these notes that are now being declassified may well be, John Brennan knew
[2:47:20.960 --> 2:47:23.960]  that maybe the scheme wasn't going to play out so he was running for...
[2:47:23.960 --> 2:47:26.120]  You're saying they were running for Hillary for being a Russian operative, which we know
[2:47:26.120 --> 2:47:27.120]  she was.
[2:47:27.120 --> 2:47:29.720]  They just moved all that BS on to Trump?
[2:47:29.720 --> 2:47:33.640]  Well, I think that Brennan, these notes that are being declassified are from...
[2:47:33.640 --> 2:47:34.640]  Hold on, we gotta have a break.
[2:47:34.640 --> 2:47:37.880]  Do a few more minutes with us, because I know, I believe you, it's amazing.
[2:47:37.880 --> 2:47:40.080]  I want to hear the rest of this on the other side.
[2:47:40.080 --> 2:47:44.880]  And then we've got a great investigative journalist about to take over.
[2:47:44.880 --> 2:47:49.440]  John Rabaport, hey, by the way, it's the last time we've got, by Friday, if you get your

[2:48:43.760 --> 2:48:48.240]  World government, globalist forces, trying to take over the United States is mainstream
[2:48:48.240 --> 2:48:51.840]  news and info wars credibility has gone through the roof.

[2:49:34.240 --> 2:49:38.280]  Oxford's dictionary has a very simple definition of terrorism.
[2:49:38.280 --> 2:49:41.160]  Other dictionaries have similar ones.
[2:49:41.160 --> 2:49:46.760]  Terrorism is the threat of force or actually carrying out force for a political or financial
[2:49:46.760 --> 2:49:48.260]  reason.
[2:49:48.260 --> 2:49:52.240]  It's basically scaring the hell out of people until you submit to them.
[2:49:52.240 --> 2:49:55.200]  That's exactly what all this overblown COVID-19 garbage is.
[2:49:55.200 --> 2:50:00.680]  You see the headlines from CNN, ABC News, doctors say it's worse than they ever thought COVID
[2:50:00.680 --> 2:50:05.600]  was more devastating than they ever imagined, they told us that two and a half million people
[2:50:05.600 --> 2:50:11.360]  would be dead just eight months ago, within three months, okay, it's a quarter million
[2:50:11.360 --> 2:50:17.120]  if you count all of the people that died of other things, we're talking 96% had comorbidity.
[2:50:17.120 --> 2:50:18.120]  These are real numbers.
[2:50:18.120 --> 2:50:19.120]  These are real facts.
[2:50:19.120 --> 2:50:23.160]  This is the chicken little event where we all run our houses, never come out and are
[2:50:23.160 --> 2:50:24.160]  taught we're not essential.
[2:50:24.160 --> 2:50:29.120]  All the big box stores in Amazon take over the planet, rebuke it, stand up against it.
[2:50:29.120 --> 2:50:36.640]  This is slavery, it is not something you could put up with and survive.
[2:50:36.640 --> 2:50:42.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:50:42.240 --> 2:50:52.960]  Dr. Patrick M. Byrne is our guest and on record he did date the supposed Russian spy that
[2:50:52.960 --> 2:50:57.280]  tried to infiltrate the NRA, really she was just trying to be a right-winger and I think
[2:50:57.280 --> 2:51:02.040]  that's what we hear, that's all their interview, he could disagree with me, he dated her, but
[2:51:02.040 --> 2:51:07.080]  that's how he got into this, that's how the FBI was with him, that's how all this is unfolding.
[2:51:07.080 --> 2:51:09.720]  This is a short segment, longer segment coming up.
[2:51:09.720 --> 2:51:13.400]  Big picture here, Patrick.
[2:51:13.400 --> 2:51:18.080]  These power groups, I mean I know that's true from research and sources that the Clintons
[2:51:18.080 --> 2:51:22.240]  and the Obamas are two different camps, then you've got Trump kind of this maverick coming
[2:51:22.240 --> 2:51:29.120]  in with some backing of some foreign groups, I mean Israeli backing, not Chinese or Russian,
[2:51:29.120 --> 2:51:33.200]  that's a whole other camp in Israel, those are multiple camps.
[2:51:33.200 --> 2:51:37.280]  This is a fight of different camps, but Trump did want to relaunch America, have it be dominant,
[2:51:37.280 --> 2:51:39.800]  that's why I backed him, because I'm an American first here.
[2:51:39.800 --> 2:51:43.200]  Just a few minutes we have in this short segment, what's the big picture, I understand your
[2:51:43.200 --> 2:51:48.720]  story from four years ago, it's very pertinent, you're telling it now, but obviously what
[2:51:48.720 --> 2:51:53.240]  does this do to the future, and how does this project onto what's currently happening?
[2:51:53.240 --> 2:51:59.800]  Well, first of all, this is a scythe, you're experiencing a scythe, the stages of which
[2:51:59.800 --> 2:52:07.280]  are demoralization, disorientation, crisis, then normalization, and the demoralization
[2:52:07.280 --> 2:52:17.080]  is this, you know, COVID-19, that's a, I mean it's not to say that it's nothing, but it
[2:52:17.080 --> 2:52:21.600]  should have been handled like Sweden handled it, and all the evidence and all the science
[2:52:21.600 --> 2:52:26.480]  indicates at this point that that was the lowest deaths per millions of population,
[2:52:26.480 --> 2:52:27.480]  which is the correct measure.
[2:52:27.480 --> 2:52:31.520]  Yeah, they tried to panic us, they use it as a scythe, but they never want to end, so
[2:52:31.520 --> 2:52:33.080]  how do we break the scythe?
[2:52:33.080 --> 2:52:38.040]  So then disorientation is basically what we're seeing in the streets, I happened to walk
[2:52:38.040 --> 2:52:43.640]  in front of the FBI a couple of weeks ago, and there's guys on motorcycles, anti-foot
[2:52:43.640 --> 2:52:49.520]  guys, and ATVs doing donuts and wheelies on the sidewalk, and the street of the FBI,
[2:52:49.520 --> 2:52:56.960]  and the FBI just standing back, the FBI agents I've ever met, they're not the guys who joined
[2:52:56.960 --> 2:53:03.040]  the FBI or just came back from that, they, they're, the left is demoralizing us, destabilizing
[2:53:03.040 --> 2:53:04.200]  us, pissing on our face.
[2:53:04.200 --> 2:53:08.760]  The crisis is creating a fake and imposter president, any eight-year-old could see, so
[2:53:08.760 --> 2:53:12.760]  first I didn't vote for Donald Trump, I vote on principle, and on principle, I'm against
[2:53:12.760 --> 2:53:18.560]  violence, I'm a, I'm a pacifist libertarian, small old, small art republican libertarian,
[2:53:18.560 --> 2:53:22.280]  but an eight-year-old could see that this got stolen, and that's the crisis, there's
[2:53:22.280 --> 2:53:28.640]  this imposter, and they're telling us we're the kooks for not buying into their scythe.
[2:53:28.640 --> 2:53:32.640]  You know, if you showed some, if you guys went to the Amazon and found some dusty village,
[2:53:32.640 --> 2:53:37.000]  some eight-year-old kid, and some basically, you know, lawful village, and you showed them
[2:53:37.000 --> 2:53:41.240]  movies of ballots, suitcases of ballots being pulled out while everyone's shooting onto
[2:53:41.240 --> 2:53:43.840]  the counting, you know, the eight-year-old would tell you, oh, they're, they're stealing
[2:53:43.840 --> 2:53:47.880]  the election, but they're trying to tell you that you're not seeing what you're seeing.
[2:53:47.880 --> 2:53:52.440]  That's to, that's the disorientation and this crisis, and now they're just trying to normalize
[2:53:52.440 --> 2:53:58.080]  it by making you think that you're crazy if you see anything irregular about this election.
[2:53:58.080 --> 2:54:01.920]  There are scandals all over the world just like this, they may have done this in 52 countries,
[2:54:01.920 --> 2:54:05.840]  they may be shifting the balance of power in whole worlds, anywhere dictated, anyway,
[2:54:05.840 --> 2:54:12.080]  and behind, there is my beloved China, one of my undergraduate major, Dartmouth, Chinese,
[2:54:12.080 --> 2:54:16.840]  Chinese history and such, I was there 83, 84, studying oddly enough ancient Chinese history
[2:54:16.840 --> 2:54:22.160]  all the way up to Maoist thought, this is a Chinese, the Chinese have searched for years
[2:54:22.160 --> 2:54:27.640]  for a, you should do a show on this, Assassin's Mace, Shaw Show GM, Assassin's Mace, for ten
[2:54:27.640 --> 2:54:32.000]  years our national security is known, they have some weapon coming that takes us out
[2:54:32.000 --> 2:54:36.200]  with one blow, and it's referenced in an old Chinese story, one kingdom takes out another
[2:54:36.200 --> 2:54:40.080]  without having to fight a war, you get the right guy, the right place, the assassin.
[2:54:40.080 --> 2:54:42.000]  We wondered what's the Assassin's Mace?
[2:54:42.000 --> 2:54:46.880]  I think we're experiencing the, Shaw Show GM, the Assassin's Mace, is with one blow
[2:54:46.880 --> 2:54:47.880]  and they knock us out.
[2:54:47.880 --> 2:54:52.480]  I totally agree, in fact, we've seen Chinese leaders brag that they used the COVID to lock
[2:54:52.480 --> 2:54:56.880]  us down, they say we're over, they're already reopened, we have to recognize this is an
[2:54:56.880 --> 2:55:01.040]  Assassin's Mace, and we have to understand that if we stay in this state of panicked
[2:55:01.040 --> 2:55:03.560]  chicken little fear, we're done.
[2:55:03.560 --> 2:55:08.120]  You're right, Sweden, Sweden, look at this numbers for Sweden, good work Alex, digging
[2:55:08.120 --> 2:55:13.280]  this up before the mainstream idiots, they're still in this, having the vapors about hydrochloroquine,
[2:55:13.280 --> 2:55:18.560]  how dangerous it was, every kid I knew over in Asia, when we were over there in college,
[2:55:18.560 --> 2:55:22.600]  everybody just prophylactically took HCQ, after ten years, two percent of people have
[2:55:22.600 --> 2:55:27.520]  a heart problem, have a heart murmur, on that basis, rather than, and we were talking about
[2:55:27.520 --> 2:55:31.120]  for this treatment five days of three hours a day.
[2:55:31.120 --> 2:55:35.200]  Stay there too, there's one more segment though on Big Pinscher, back in 60 seconds,
[2:55:35.200 --> 2:55:41.800]  stay with us.
[2:55:41.800 --> 2:55:45.320]  The globalists have always been at war with the family and small businesses, they want
[2:55:45.320 --> 2:55:51.280]  control, they want domesticated slaves, that's the process that is taking place right now.
[2:55:51.280 --> 2:55:55.800]  And when you shop at the big box stores, and when you shop with Amazon, remember that they
[2:55:55.800 --> 2:56:00.200]  are creating monopolies, and they are the globalists that are pushing the lockdowns,
[2:56:00.200 --> 2:56:04.160]  gun control, abortion, world government, all of it, and if you want to do that, go ahead
[2:56:04.160 --> 2:56:08.480]  and shop there, but if you'll shop at InfoWars, where we have thousands of products, made
[2:56:08.480 --> 2:56:13.280]  right here in America, with our warehouses, and our crew, it's incredible, and it changes
[2:56:13.280 --> 2:56:17.320]  the whole world, so do your shopping, if you want to fund the InfoWars, and if you want

[2:56:54.000 --> 2:57:01.200]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:57:01.200 --> 2:57:09.040]  Dr. Patrick M. Byrne is our guest, he knows what he's talking about, he talks about the
[2:57:09.040 --> 2:57:13.280]  CHICOMS, this death blow operation, but you were just talking during the break about you
[2:57:13.280 --> 2:57:17.200]  need to warn people, this is an emergency, about what's coming next, and why we've got
[2:57:17.200 --> 2:57:20.960]  to fight this, and why you're putting it on the line, why so many others are putting it
[2:57:20.960 --> 2:57:25.880]  on the line, with this CHICOM takeover, if we don't act now, forget election fraud, Joe
[2:57:25.880 --> 2:57:31.080]  Biden's a CHICOM agent on record, with his son admitting it in recordings, and them taking
[2:57:31.080 --> 2:57:36.400]  the cash publicly, and Joe Biden saying, China should influence every aspect of our lives
[2:57:36.400 --> 2:57:40.240]  with Confucius Institutes, I mean, this is open and shut right now.
[2:57:40.240 --> 2:57:49.120]  Well, I love the Chinese, I love the Chinese as a culture, as a people, this isn't the
[2:57:49.120 --> 2:57:55.480]  most gen, I mean, the thing I love about the Chinese is a certain aspect, and this isn't
[2:57:55.480 --> 2:58:00.120]  them as they're most admirable, this is the Han Chinese being Han about things, rather
[2:58:00.120 --> 2:58:05.000]  than trying to join the liberal world order, and by liberal, and I think I made this point
[2:58:05.000 --> 2:58:09.440]  last time on your show, don't puke your shoes, we're both liberals, Alex, I'm kind of digging
[2:58:09.440 --> 2:58:14.040]  your groove here, I'm sorry I haven't listened to you more, but you know, Eleanor Roosevelt
[2:58:14.040 --> 2:58:19.160]  said, great minds speak of ideas, average minds speak of events, weak minds speak of
[2:58:19.160 --> 2:58:25.800]  people, this mainstream press has been obsessed with one person for four years, you speak
[2:58:25.800 --> 2:58:30.080]  about ideas on this show, and you speak about the right ideas, we are defending the history
[2:58:30.080 --> 2:58:36.360]  of liberalism, and if we lose the most atomic concept of our history, the most atomic concept
[2:58:36.360 --> 2:58:38.960]  of our history is consent to the governed.
[2:58:38.960 --> 2:58:43.640]  They asked us, really over the last decade, as I think you've noticed, they've asked us
[2:58:43.640 --> 2:58:48.480]  to surrender on freedom of speech, we've compromised on freedom of speech, and really freedom of
[2:58:48.480 --> 2:58:54.920]  religion, and innocent until proven guilty, and well, they've gotten to the last and most
[2:58:54.920 --> 2:58:59.080]  atomic concept, which is consent to the governed, as determined in elections that are free and
[2:58:59.080 --> 2:59:00.080]  fair and transparent.
[2:59:00.080 --> 2:59:04.360]  And they're coming with force inoculations, they are literally raping us.
[2:59:04.360 --> 2:59:08.040]  Well, I don't know about, I don't want to talk about the inoculations, I started my
[2:59:08.040 --> 2:59:12.920]  circle of competence, I'll make my own private decision on that, and after I study it more,
[2:59:12.920 --> 2:59:20.240]  I don't want to be a free rider, if it's, but anyway, I understand, but I think that
[2:59:20.240 --> 2:59:26.720]  if we bend a knee on this, until these are transparent, they clearly, in my view, I'm
[2:59:26.720 --> 2:59:31.880]  on the inside, I can't say too much, I'm under judges' orders, because the, well, no,
[2:59:31.880 --> 2:59:32.880]  I guess that's all we need.
[2:59:32.880 --> 2:59:35.920]  Well, just, no, you're doing a great job, you'll come back on China soon for a whole
[2:59:35.920 --> 2:59:39.800]  hour, you're fascinating, but other key tidbits you want to give people right now, and a prelude
[2:59:39.800 --> 2:59:41.320]  to what's coming?
[2:59:41.320 --> 2:59:46.720]  Well, I haven't dropped the biggest bombshells, there's two more, and I should probably tell
[2:59:46.720 --> 2:59:52.360]  them in one story, and I'll tell them in one appearance next week, if you want.
[2:59:52.360 --> 2:59:56.280]  But a lot of this, for 15 years, I've been exploring the subject, and had a website
[2:59:56.280 --> 3:00:01.920]  called Deep Capture, it was dormant for a decade, until I took this on, I parachuted
[3:00:01.920 --> 3:00:08.920]  out of a company, I started 20 years ago, and built, and had a great time, and worked
[3:00:08.920 --> 3:00:14.600]  with fun people, and had a great life in Utah, I parachuted out of it and took all that capital
[3:00:14.600 --> 3:00:19.960]  into finishing this fight, it's really a fight that started 15 years ago, and when I took
[3:00:19.960 --> 3:00:24.520]  on, I was kind of a one-man occupier of Wall Street, in 08, when everything melted down,
[3:00:24.520 --> 3:00:29.240]  the Wall Street Journal came out and said, yeah, the crazy guy turned out to be right,
[3:00:29.240 --> 3:00:34.000]  I did Bloomberg, and actually they did in 07, but I had that all figured out, and there
[3:00:34.000 --> 3:00:40.880]  was a particular crack on Wall Street, but after that 08, 09, it ended up as somebody
[3:00:40.880 --> 3:00:46.920]  confirmed on Fox, and the clip is up on that site, a U.S. attorney named Brett Tolman,
[3:00:46.920 --> 3:00:53.640]  if you go to YouTube and look up Still Report from August 2019, Patrick Byrne was right,
[3:00:53.640 --> 3:00:57.560]  something like that, they have this clip from Fox, where this U.S. attorney went live,
[3:00:57.560 --> 3:01:02.800]  somehow you can't find this on the Fox machines, you can find it on YouTube, that U.S. attorney
[3:01:02.800 --> 3:01:08.200]  talked about, that he was the senior counsel of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2006,
[3:01:08.200 --> 3:01:13.000]  and I walked in off the street, and brought the material for this investigation that turned
[3:01:13.000 --> 3:01:17.960]  into this massive FBI investigation, and 200 people went to jail, after that happened,
[3:01:17.960 --> 3:01:22.440]  I kind of went dormant on deep capture, it was voted the best investigative journalism
[3:01:22.440 --> 3:01:28.120]  in business investigative journalism in America, and the best logged on corruption in America
[3:01:28.120 --> 3:01:33.200]  in 2008, and then I kind of discontinued, when I took this on, I started writing back
[3:01:33.200 --> 3:01:37.400]  up there, you can find a lot more nuggets up there, and some rather shocking things,
[3:01:37.400 --> 3:01:43.320]  I'm going to come back in the next two, two, I'll come back and tell you the next two pieces
[3:01:43.320 --> 3:01:45.200]  of the story sometime, but you are pursuing-
[3:01:45.200 --> 3:01:48.880]  We'd love to have you do it, but here's the deal, is there any way for Trump to stop this
[3:01:48.880 --> 3:01:51.520]  theft, we've got mass evidence of fraud, as you said-
[3:01:51.520 --> 3:01:55.040]  No, we can't offend any of this, I did not vote for Donald Trump, but we can't offend
[3:01:55.040 --> 3:01:56.040]  any of this, this is not-
[3:01:56.040 --> 3:01:59.880]  So, what should the president do?
[3:01:59.880 --> 3:02:10.440]  Well, no comment, no comment, that's for people with a lot more thorough grasp-
[3:02:10.440 --> 3:02:14.000]  No, I hear you, people ask me what to do, and I have a lot of knowledge, but I'll tell
[3:02:14.000 --> 3:02:21.040]  you, I had high level military people, just last week, high level, currently in the military,
[3:02:21.040 --> 3:02:24.120]  they say what do we do, and they weren't trying to set me up, they were asking me, and I said
[3:02:24.120 --> 3:02:26.600]  I don't know, they go, we don't know either, it's-
[3:02:26.600 --> 3:02:32.520]  These elections were not fair, and if we give up on this, it's not like they get better
[3:02:32.520 --> 3:02:38.600]  in 2022, I'm sure that's what the Venezuelans felt in 1997, and then Hugo Chavez, there
[3:02:38.600 --> 3:02:43.400]  was a coup, he got, or 97, 98, he got elected, there was a coup, he almost lost power, he
[3:02:43.400 --> 3:02:49.600]  comes back in 2000, he has a six year term, December 2003, he's down 40, 60 in the polls,
[3:02:49.600 --> 3:02:53.760]  he has to do, someone calls a referendum, which you can under the Venezuelan constitution
[3:02:53.760 --> 3:02:58.840]  after three years, Chavez goes out to these three Venezuelan scientists and says, build
[3:02:58.840 --> 3:03:04.440]  me a computer-based voting system that we can cheat with and steal the election, and
[3:03:04.440 --> 3:03:05.440]  they come up with-
[3:03:05.440 --> 3:03:06.440]  That's called Dominion.
[3:03:06.440 --> 3:03:11.840]  No, it's called Smartmatic, Smartmatic, and that's what they did, and he won 60, 40, and
[3:03:11.840 --> 3:03:12.840]  still-
[3:03:12.840 --> 3:03:15.960]  No, it's true, it's true that Smartmatic was from Venezuela, but they're threatening
[3:03:15.960 --> 3:03:17.680]  to sue everybody right now too, right?
[3:03:17.680 --> 3:03:23.200]  Yeah, good luck with that, litigation is a core competency, bring it on, I can't wait
[3:03:23.200 --> 3:03:29.880]  to get discovery on that, I'll stick $10 million aside, just to pursue your asses, so bring
[3:03:29.880 --> 3:03:34.920]  it on, but I can't wait to get discovery in that case, but I think you've got bigger
[3:03:34.920 --> 3:03:42.200]  problems than me, gentlemen at Smartmatic, so anyway, that's what it was built for,
[3:03:42.200 --> 3:03:47.040]  and now in Venezuela, people are on the starvation, today as a starvation, there's even reports
[3:03:47.040 --> 3:03:49.280]  of occasional cannibalism in Venezuela.
[3:03:49.280 --> 3:03:52.400]  Oh yeah, they ate all the zoo animals five years ago.
[3:03:52.400 --> 3:03:56.920]  The government magically keeps getting voted back into power with good, comfortable majorities,
[3:03:56.920 --> 3:03:58.280]  does that seem a lot?
[3:03:58.280 --> 3:04:03.520]  Well that's equipment, is the guts of the ESNS and the Dominion machines up here.
[3:04:03.520 --> 3:04:10.640]  So Dr. Patrick M. Byrne, we thank you at Patrick Byrne, DeepCapture.com, I would love for you
[3:04:10.640 --> 3:04:15.320]  to release your next bombshells next Monday if you'd like, whenever you'd like, here

[3:04:24.720 --> 3:04:25.720]  bit more.
[3:04:25.720 --> 3:04:30.560]  Alright, me too, I hear you, I had the former head of CIA say, arrest me yesterday, and
[3:04:30.560 --> 3:04:34.040]  I'm not like trying to over top what he's saying, but it's true, once you're involved
[3:04:34.040 --> 3:04:41.840]  in this stuff, it gets crazy, it is nuts, alright, he's taken over, no more fakenews.com,
[3:04:41.840 --> 3:04:46.440]  John Rappaport, straight ahead, always informative, always powerful, and then Owen Schreuer, the
[3:04:46.440 --> 3:04:50.960]  war room, that is three to six, and then they take an hour break, an hour, first hour of
[3:04:50.960 --> 3:04:55.960]  my show, and then boom, election countdown, because people said, where's election countdown
[3:04:55.960 --> 3:04:56.960]  going?
[3:04:56.960 --> 3:05:02.480]  And I said, oh, the seven, nine days of hell, and this whole fight, we knew this was coming.
[3:05:02.480 --> 3:05:06.880]  They promised to do it, they did it, we're here, we're fighting, but the only way we
[3:05:06.880 --> 3:05:09.640]  can fund this is your support.

[3:06:09.560 --> 3:06:13.360]  Alpha Power had one patented ingredient that we couldn't get because of the lockdown.
[3:06:13.360 --> 3:06:17.120]  I said this was a discontinued product, had been there for a year because we didn't reorder
[3:06:17.120 --> 3:06:20.960]  so then we tried to get it nine, 10 months ago, they couldn't do it, they said, oh, sorry.

[3:07:14.480 --> 3:07:15.480]  to stop it.

[3:08:47.360 --> 3:09:17.320]  And now your host, John Rappaport, here we are again, folks, for another weekly,
[3:09:17.320 --> 3:09:30.760]  live chat, lots of news, lots of news, this hour, fax, fax, fax, the COVID vaccine.
[3:09:30.760 --> 3:09:34.520]  So we lead off with this story.
[3:09:34.520 --> 3:09:43.920]  When the frail and elderly die after receiving the COVID vaccine, what then?
[3:09:43.920 --> 3:09:46.720]  This is a CNN story.
[3:09:46.720 --> 3:09:54.400]  There are doctors who have been advising the CDC, a panel of doctors.
[3:09:54.400 --> 3:10:02.160]  Should we bring the elderly and the frail up to or toward the head of the line as the
[3:10:02.160 --> 3:10:07.640]  first people receiving the new COVID vaccine?
[3:10:07.640 --> 3:10:11.360]  So overwhelmingly, the vote was yes.
[3:10:11.360 --> 3:10:16.120]  But there were one or two doctors that were wobbly, very wobbly.
[3:10:16.120 --> 3:10:19.040]  Not sure if this was a good idea.
[3:10:19.040 --> 3:10:27.520]  So the first blockbuster that we learn is that in the clinical trials of the vaccine,
[3:10:27.520 --> 3:10:34.400]  prior to their getting approval by the FDA, the frail and the elderly were not in any
[3:10:34.400 --> 3:10:38.120]  of those clinical trials.
[3:10:38.120 --> 3:10:40.600]  You understand what that means, right?
[3:10:40.600 --> 3:10:47.880]  The vaccine was never tested on them to see what it would do, what effects it would have,
[3:10:47.880 --> 3:10:52.480]  what harm it would create, whether it was effective at all.
[3:10:52.480 --> 3:10:59.240]  And one of these doctors comes out and says, well, we know that for other vaccines, they're
[3:10:59.240 --> 3:11:03.360]  not as effective in the frail and the elderly.
[3:11:03.360 --> 3:11:07.240]  So that's called a clue.
[3:11:07.240 --> 3:11:12.240]  And then come some just unbelievable statements.
[3:11:12.240 --> 3:11:20.360]  Well, we're worried about the perception of the public if people that are frail and elderly
[3:11:20.360 --> 3:11:24.920]  start dying after receiving the vaccine.
[3:11:24.920 --> 3:11:33.600]  And the word is, well, people should not be alarmed, okay?
[3:11:33.600 --> 3:11:41.840]  People should not be alarmed if frail and elderly persons die after receiving the COVID
[3:11:41.840 --> 3:11:48.240]  vaccine, because after all, these people are in nursing homes, long-term care facilities,
[3:11:48.240 --> 3:11:53.120]  and that's where people are at the end of their lives, and they die.
[3:11:53.120 --> 3:11:58.040]  As if this is going to fly as an excuse.
[3:11:58.040 --> 3:12:04.200]  Because it were your mother or father who received, you know, they're in a nursing home.
[3:12:04.200 --> 3:12:11.880]  They're not healthy, they're elderly, but they're doing okay.
[3:12:11.880 --> 3:12:17.240]  Then they get the vaccine and two days later or a day later, they die.
[3:12:17.240 --> 3:12:19.480]  But don't be alarmed.
[3:12:19.480 --> 3:12:21.280]  Don't be alarmed.
[3:12:21.280 --> 3:12:28.440]  This is a direct quote from this panel, medical panel.
[3:12:28.440 --> 3:12:37.440]  People should not be alarmed if this happens, because, well, these people are dying anyway.
[3:12:37.440 --> 3:12:40.960]  So this is called murder.
[3:12:40.960 --> 3:12:41.960]  Absolute murder.
[3:12:41.960 --> 3:12:42.960]  It's an experiment.
[3:12:42.960 --> 3:12:49.120]  It's guinea pigs, and the guinea pigs are the elderly in these nursing homes and long-term
[3:12:49.120 --> 3:12:54.840]  care facilities and in hospitals and in their own homes.
[3:12:54.840 --> 3:13:00.080]  Because again, none of them were in the clinical trials of the vaccine.
[3:13:00.080 --> 3:13:05.600]  So there is no data whatsoever to indicate what happens to these people when they get
[3:13:05.600 --> 3:13:13.320]  a brand new technology called mRNA that's never been released to the public before,
[3:13:13.320 --> 3:13:18.960]  but is now released in the new COVID vaccine.
[3:13:18.960 --> 3:13:22.520]  But don't be alarmed, certainly not.
[3:13:22.520 --> 3:13:28.720]  Because after all, the doctor would tell you if your parent died as a result of the vaccine
[3:13:28.720 --> 3:13:37.280]  as opposed to dying from whatever health issues that parent had, right?
[3:13:37.280 --> 3:13:44.920]  And if you believe that, I've got condos on the far side of the moon for sale.
[3:13:44.920 --> 3:13:51.360]  In fact, the doctors would have no way of knowing what to tell you.
[3:13:51.360 --> 3:14:00.120]  Because for the third time, no elderly and frail people were included in the clinical
[3:14:00.120 --> 3:14:05.440]  trials of the COVID vaccine.
[3:14:05.440 --> 3:14:08.720]  This is an unbelievable story.
[3:14:08.720 --> 3:14:16.320]  I've documented before, and I've discussed on the show here, COVID is old people.
[3:14:16.320 --> 3:14:18.000]  That's what it's all about.
[3:14:18.000 --> 3:14:25.560]  A gigantic percentage of so-called COVID deaths all over the world are among the elderly who
[3:14:25.560 --> 3:14:30.920]  are confined to nursing homes and long-care facilities.
[3:14:30.920 --> 3:14:38.320]  These people have multiple serious long-term health issues, very serious, and they've
[3:14:38.320 --> 3:14:44.600]  been treated for years, if not decades, with toxic medical drugs.
[3:14:44.600 --> 3:14:50.600]  And they're terrified of getting a COVID-19 diagnosis.
[3:14:50.600 --> 3:14:54.400]  And then they do get that diagnosis.
[3:14:54.400 --> 3:14:56.840]  And then they are even more terrified.
[3:14:56.840 --> 3:15:04.080]  And then they are cut off and isolated from loved ones, family, friends.
[3:15:04.080 --> 3:15:07.680]  And they give up and they die.
[3:15:07.680 --> 3:15:13.400]  No virus required whatsoever has nothing to do with the virus.
[3:15:13.400 --> 3:15:21.080]  It has to do with forced, early, premature deaths, murder, in other words, of the elderly,
[3:15:21.080 --> 3:15:31.480]  in order to create COVID death numbers, thereby justifying the lockdowns and the economic devastation.
[3:15:31.480 --> 3:15:36.440]  So this is genocide planned among the elderly.
[3:15:36.440 --> 3:15:45.400]  And now on top of all of that, we have the introduction of this COVID vaccine, which
[3:15:45.400 --> 3:15:53.800]  we know in past attempts to get a license for the RNA technology, it didn't fly because
[3:15:53.800 --> 3:16:01.440]  serious problems resulted among the volunteers in the clinical trials of drugs or vaccines.
[3:16:01.440 --> 3:16:09.520]  Similarly what's called autoimmune reactions, meaning the body basically attacks itself.
[3:16:09.520 --> 3:16:18.200]  But now, boom, for the first time with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and soon to be the
[3:16:18.200 --> 3:16:27.160]  Moderna vaccine, we have carte blanche for a new type of vaccine which will be injected
[3:16:27.160 --> 3:16:33.520]  directly at the head of the line to the elderly and the frail.
[3:16:33.520 --> 3:16:43.080]  I mean, there is nothing whatsoever in medical ethics that would justify this, even in conventional
[3:16:43.080 --> 3:16:47.280]  medical ethics which don't exist.
[3:16:47.280 --> 3:16:55.560]  This is a war crime violation, basically, murder on a mass scale.
[3:16:55.560 --> 3:17:04.600]  So when the elderly and the frail begin dying, they will be called COVID-19 deaths, doctors
[3:17:04.600 --> 3:17:09.840]  will assure the family and friends that had nothing to do with the vaccine.
[3:17:09.840 --> 3:17:11.720]  It was the health issues.
[3:17:11.720 --> 3:17:18.600]  It just so happened that these health issues kicked in the day after the vaccine was injected
[3:17:18.600 --> 3:17:22.040]  or hours after or two or three days later.
[3:17:22.040 --> 3:17:27.120]  Sorry, we're very sorry, condolences, etc.
[3:17:27.120 --> 3:17:34.000]  But be assured, nothing whatsoever to do with the vaccine.
[3:17:34.000 --> 3:17:38.200]  And no major media are exploring this or analyzing it.
[3:17:38.200 --> 3:17:42.320]  The Pope came out yesterday and announced a global government corporate alliance to
[3:17:42.320 --> 3:17:47.240]  redistribute wealth and create a planetary universal income, which of course the United
[3:17:47.240 --> 3:17:51.040]  Nations and Global Corporations will control through the apps on your phone and finally
[3:17:51.040 --> 3:17:52.240]  a chip under your skin.
[3:17:52.240 --> 3:17:58.240]  It's all now completely official, part of the UN Great Reset of the Davos Group and
[3:17:58.240 --> 3:18:02.960]  Cloud Schwab, all officially written about in hundreds of books by Schwab and Rockefeller
[3:18:02.960 --> 3:18:08.080]  Foundation, all the rest of them, Agenda 21, Agenda 2030, it's here and only gets worse
[3:18:08.080 --> 3:18:12.920]  like being fed into a wood chipper or a meat grinder until you reject it all.
[3:18:12.920 --> 3:18:20.440]  And the rejection starts with realizing it's a spiritual battle for civil and stopping abortion.
[3:18:20.440 --> 3:18:22.600]  We must start valuing human life again.
[3:18:22.600 --> 3:18:29.680]  We must start saying that we are not expendable, that we are not disposable, that we are essential.
[3:18:29.680 --> 3:18:32.240]  Until we do that, we are all slaves.
[3:18:32.240 --> 3:18:38.040]  We must stand up and declare our basic God-given human rights now.
[3:18:38.040 --> 3:18:43.240]  I've got some really exciting good news and I've also got some bad news.
[3:18:43.240 --> 3:18:50.280]  Info Wars is getting the highest traffic we have ever gotten since the election in 2016.
[3:18:50.280 --> 3:18:55.040]  Despite all the bans, all of the system trying to censor us and suppress us, you with your
[3:18:55.040 --> 3:18:59.800]  word of mouth have overridden that and they are so scared of InfoWars.com and banned on
[3:18:59.800 --> 3:19:03.760]  video and they're so scared of you being able to communicate and share the truth.
[3:19:03.760 --> 3:19:08.360]  But we're bringing in the same amount of money we brought in last December right now.
[3:19:08.360 --> 3:19:12.000]  This is our most important month to be able to fund ourselves in the next year.
[3:19:12.000 --> 3:19:13.440]  And I understand the economy is shut down.
[3:19:13.440 --> 3:19:15.440]  I understand there's not as much money as there used to be.
[3:19:15.440 --> 3:19:19.080]  They're trying to kill Trump's recovery, but Info Wars really needs your support.
[3:19:19.080 --> 3:19:23.840]  You just buy great items, do your Christmas shopping at InfoWars.com with huge sales,
[3:19:23.840 --> 3:19:27.920]  amazing products, and then you know you're funding the Info War and not funding Amazon
[3:19:27.920 --> 3:19:32.320]  and Jeff Bezos and the globalists that are openly trying to destroy small businesses.
[3:19:32.320 --> 3:19:35.760]  Continue to fund the Second American Revolution while getting great products at the same time
[3:19:35.760 --> 3:19:36.760]  at InfoWars.com.
[3:19:36.760 --> 3:19:37.760]  Thank you.
[3:19:37.760 --> 3:19:40.960]  The best product, I'm not supposed to be biased, but I'm going to tell you all now,
[3:19:40.960 --> 3:19:43.280]  if you haven't tried TurboForce, you need to try it.
[3:19:43.280 --> 3:19:45.440]  I've tried TurboForce with everything.
[3:19:45.440 --> 3:19:49.520]  Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy, I put TurboForce in my coffee.
[3:19:49.520 --> 3:19:50.520]  That was a crazy week.
[3:19:50.520 --> 3:19:54.200]  I don't remember sleeping, but as far as the products go, TurboForce is my favorite and
[3:19:54.200 --> 3:19:57.640]  all the InfoWars products are down to taking control of your life, taking control of your
[3:19:57.640 --> 3:20:02.360]  health, not relying on other people to do it for you.
[3:20:02.360 --> 3:20:06.520]  Nobody wakes up in the morning and thinks, I'm going to give that person over there a
[3:20:06.520 --> 3:20:07.520]  better life.
[3:20:07.520 --> 3:20:08.520]  I'm going to wake up today.
[3:20:08.520 --> 3:20:09.520]  You know what?
[3:20:09.520 --> 3:20:12.360]  I'm going to spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier, happier
[3:20:12.360 --> 3:20:13.360]  and richer.
[3:20:13.360 --> 3:20:15.240]  I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend.
[3:20:15.240 --> 3:20:16.680]  I don't think that happens very often.
[3:20:16.680 --> 3:20:17.680]  It's never happened to me.
[3:20:17.680 --> 3:20:20.400]  I've never had anyone knock on my door and said, Tate, you're such a good guy.
[3:20:20.400 --> 3:20:22.120]  How can I improve your life in every single way?
[3:20:22.120 --> 3:20:24.880]  There's only one person who woke up and thought that, and that was me.
[3:20:24.880 --> 3:20:27.880]  I woke up and thought, you know what, okay, I want to take control of my life.
[3:20:27.880 --> 3:20:30.920]  I want to take control of my health, and that's why you need to go to infowars.com, take control
[3:20:30.920 --> 3:20:33.120]  of your health right now and support the resistance.
[3:20:33.120 --> 3:20:34.120]  Don't buy into the group thing.
[3:20:34.120 --> 3:20:35.280]  Don't drink the Kool-Aid.
[3:20:35.280 --> 3:20:36.280]  Drink the TurboForce.
[3:20:36.280 --> 3:20:41.440]  Kool-Aid's bad and the TurboForce is good.
[3:20:41.440 --> 3:20:48.440]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:48.440 --> 3:21:08.560]  News, analysis, reports, it's the Alex Jones show, and now your host, John Rappaport.
[3:21:08.560 --> 3:21:31.840]  Okay, we're back, second seconds here, continuing on about the COVID vaccine, and I have a second
[3:21:31.840 --> 3:21:39.360]  story here, and the second story involves the equivalent of the British FDA, what they
[3:21:39.360 --> 3:21:43.680]  have said about the new COVID vaccine.
[3:21:43.680 --> 3:21:49.800]  Because you know that there were serious, severe, what were called allergic reactions
[3:21:49.800 --> 3:21:54.480]  and two health workers in England the moment that they started vaccinating people with
[3:21:54.480 --> 3:21:56.600]  the COVID vaccine.
[3:21:56.600 --> 3:22:06.560]  So the British version of rough equivalent of the US FDA said that nobody should receive
[3:22:06.560 --> 3:22:16.400]  the COVID vaccine who has a serious history of allergies to food, medicine, or vaccines.
[3:22:16.400 --> 3:22:18.920]  Wow.
[3:22:18.920 --> 3:22:28.080]  That's a news buster, gigantic buster, because how many people know that?
[3:22:28.080 --> 3:22:30.560]  How many people are aware of that?
[3:22:30.560 --> 3:22:34.560]  How many people in the public understand that?
[3:22:34.560 --> 3:22:41.720]  How many doctors, how many nurses, how many, what amounts to trained clerks that are sitting
[3:22:41.720 --> 3:22:51.160]  there in some room giving COVID vaccine injections, understand that this must be part of informed
[3:22:51.160 --> 3:22:56.840]  consent, which is not just a simple little brush off thing, like, hey, do you have any
[3:22:56.840 --> 3:22:57.840]  allergies?
[3:22:57.840 --> 3:22:58.840]  Well, I don't know.
[3:22:58.840 --> 3:23:07.360]  And okay, here's a shot, no, nobody, this is the equivalent of the British FDA who has
[3:23:07.360 --> 3:23:16.280]  a serious allergy to food or medicine or vaccines should receive the vaccine.
[3:23:16.280 --> 3:23:21.080]  Boom, boom, and boom.
[3:23:21.080 --> 3:23:31.240]  So in addition to that, the British agency said that, and get this, everywhere, every
[3:23:31.240 --> 3:23:41.560]  location where the vaccine is being given must have resuscitation equipment on board.
[3:23:41.560 --> 3:23:44.480]  Resuscitation equipment on board.
[3:23:44.480 --> 3:23:47.080]  You understand what that means, right?
[3:23:47.080 --> 3:23:52.960]  If somebody goes into anaphylactic shock right after the vaccine, this is equipment that
[3:23:52.960 --> 3:23:56.960]  is supposed to be there to resuscitate them.
[3:23:56.960 --> 3:24:04.040]  And they are talking about obviously life-threatening allergic reactions to the vaccine, or what
[3:24:04.040 --> 3:24:10.480]  I described in the last segment as autoimmune reactions to the vaccine.
[3:24:10.480 --> 3:24:22.400]  Okay, so do you seriously think that in the attempt to rush this vaccine into use at
[3:24:22.400 --> 3:24:31.000]  war speed, injecting it into hundreds of millions of people in a brief amount of time, that
[3:24:31.000 --> 3:24:38.360]  in every location or many locations or even some locations where it's being given, that
[3:24:38.360 --> 3:24:45.200]  resuscitation equipment is going to be on board, are you kidding me?
[3:24:45.200 --> 3:24:47.800]  Are you kidding me?
[3:24:47.800 --> 3:24:52.380]  Of course not, absolutely not.
[3:24:52.380 --> 3:24:56.160]  So now let's get down to another issue here.
[3:24:56.160 --> 3:25:06.480]  In my notes, just want to refer to this, oh yeah, Denver Post, another blockbuster statement.
[3:25:06.480 --> 3:25:14.880]  People with a history of severe allergic reactions were excluded from the clinical trials of
[3:25:14.880 --> 3:25:17.480]  the vaccine.
[3:25:17.480 --> 3:25:24.160]  They were screened out as well as possible so that none of those people were in the trials
[3:25:24.160 --> 3:25:27.160]  of the vaccine to receive the vaccine.
[3:25:27.160 --> 3:25:32.920]  Therefore, just like the frail and the elderly that I discussed in the last segment, there
[3:25:32.920 --> 3:25:41.280]  is no data whatsoever on the reactions to the vaccine in people who have histories of
[3:25:41.280 --> 3:25:45.360]  allergies to food, medicine, or vaccine.
[3:25:45.360 --> 3:25:46.880]  No data whatsoever.
[3:25:46.880 --> 3:25:48.120]  We have no information.
[3:25:48.120 --> 3:25:49.840]  We don't know anything.
[3:25:49.840 --> 3:25:53.240]  We're in the dark, but don't worry, everything's fine.
[3:25:53.240 --> 3:25:59.920]  No, everything is not fine, quite the opposite.
[3:25:59.920 --> 3:26:09.440]  To the degree that the recommendation, which is a demand, is that everywhere that the vaccine
[3:26:09.440 --> 3:26:14.840]  is being given, resuscitation equipment is supposed to be on board.
[3:26:14.840 --> 3:26:23.200]  I mean, this is a disaster that is happening before our eyes as we speak.
[3:26:23.200 --> 3:26:30.800]  Okay, so I decided to go to stats.
[3:26:30.800 --> 3:26:40.840]  In the U.S., these are rough estimates, 16 million people have food allergies, 16 million
[3:26:40.840 --> 3:26:42.840]  people.
[3:26:42.840 --> 3:26:51.680]  1,000 show up to ERs every year with food allergies.
[3:26:51.680 --> 3:26:55.800]  What about allergies to medicines and vaccines?
[3:26:55.800 --> 3:26:57.600]  We don't know.
[3:26:57.600 --> 3:26:58.600]  We don't know.
[3:26:58.600 --> 3:27:01.840]  Let's take an example of a medicine.
[3:27:01.840 --> 3:27:06.080]  Remember penicillin, or it would be one of the antibiotics?
[3:27:06.080 --> 3:27:13.640]  Let's say somebody has a history they've received penicillin, or an antibiotic in the past,
[3:27:13.640 --> 3:27:19.120]  and they had an allergic reaction, which was a rash.
[3:27:19.120 --> 3:27:28.400]  Is that considered a serious adverse reaction, a serious allergic reaction, or do you have
[3:27:28.400 --> 3:27:35.960]  to have very bad shortness of breath in order to qualify as a serious allergic reaction?
[3:27:35.960 --> 3:27:36.960]  Nobody knows.
[3:27:36.960 --> 3:27:40.680]  Nobody has any idea.
[3:27:40.680 --> 3:27:47.840]  You could receive an antibiotic in January and have a rash, and then two years later,
[3:27:47.840 --> 3:27:51.560]  you receive the same antibiotic and you have extreme shortness of breath.
[3:27:51.560 --> 3:27:52.560]  Who knows?
[3:27:52.560 --> 3:27:53.880]  Nobody knows.
[3:27:53.880 --> 3:28:00.200]  But those people are supposed to be excluded from receiving the COVID vaccine, too.
[3:28:00.200 --> 3:28:08.400]  But how many of them are there who have a history of allergy to medicine or a vaccine?
[3:28:08.400 --> 3:28:12.680]  Completely unknown, probably millions more people.
[3:28:12.680 --> 3:28:16.560]  But who knows about this in the public?
[3:28:16.560 --> 3:28:23.160]  How many doctors or nurses giving the shots or clerks that are trained or the military
[3:28:23.160 --> 3:28:29.000]  soldiers administering the vaccine have any idea about this, or would be able to explore
[3:28:29.000 --> 3:28:36.080]  it in depth in an intelligent informed consent conversation with every person who lines up
[3:28:36.080 --> 3:28:37.640]  to get the shot?
[3:28:37.640 --> 3:28:38.640]  You're kidding me.
[3:28:38.640 --> 3:28:41.000]  There's no time for that.
[3:28:41.000 --> 3:28:42.000]  No.
[3:28:42.000 --> 3:28:45.600]  Trump wants this, and everybody wants this at warp speed.
[3:28:45.600 --> 3:28:49.800]  It's the greatest thing that's ever happened in human history, the vaccine.
[3:28:49.800 --> 3:28:51.800]  Here we go.
[3:28:51.800 --> 3:29:04.360]  A disaster, a crime in progress as we speak, rolling out right now before our eyes, receiving
[3:29:04.360 --> 3:29:07.920]  almost zero coverage in the press.
[3:29:07.920 --> 3:29:15.480]  It's all brushed aside with popping corks on champagne and celebrations of the rollout
[3:29:15.480 --> 3:29:16.480]  of the vaccine.
[3:29:16.480 --> 3:29:21.320]  The greatest thing that's ever happened in human history, oh my God, is incredible.
[3:29:21.320 --> 3:29:31.320]  And the carrot and the stick, where the governors say, well, now if everybody or 70% of everybody
[3:29:31.320 --> 3:29:36.400]  takes the vaccine, then we can seriously think about ending the lockdowns.
[3:29:36.400 --> 3:29:46.960]  But if not, then we're going to have to reimpose the lockdowns again, and the carrot and the
[3:29:46.960 --> 3:29:49.160]  stick.
[3:29:49.160 --> 3:29:56.400]  This is everything that's being publicized by the complicit criminal press, not the information
[3:29:56.400 --> 3:30:03.600]  that I'm giving you, which is connecting the dots and taking the meager tidbits that we're
[3:30:03.600 --> 3:30:09.040]  getting from the press and putting them in the spotlight as I am, and showing you what
[3:30:09.040 --> 3:30:18.360]  it all really means, which is devastation, destruction, murder, mass murder, in progress
[3:30:18.360 --> 3:30:24.560]  with the vaccine, completely untested, not only the technology, but the very people,

[3:31:36.680 --> 3:31:41.840]  During our war for independence, during some of the darkest days, Thomas Jefferson,
[3:31:41.840 --> 3:31:44.960]  the man credited with riding our Declaration of Independence and much of
[3:31:44.960 --> 3:31:48.400]  our Constitution later said, look this is not gonna be an easy fight. We're not
[3:31:48.400 --> 3:31:53.800]  gonna be transported liberty on a bed of feathers. No ladies and gentlemen, we've
[3:31:53.800 --> 3:31:58.640]  actually had incredible successes with Donald Trump and Bolsonaro and the
[3:31:58.640 --> 3:32:02.160]  Liberty Movement worldwide. We're gonna have major setbacks but there is a
[3:32:02.160 --> 3:32:05.760]  giant awakening happening. That's what the Globals have gone ahead and launched
[3:32:05.760 --> 3:32:10.040]  their great reset. Global collapse, worldwide social credit score, tracking
[3:32:10.040 --> 3:32:14.560]  app, microchip, force modulation takeover now because if they don't force it now

[3:32:42.000 --> 3:32:46.880]  listener, first time caller. Look in January 2016 I went in a hospital. I
[3:32:46.880 --> 3:32:51.120]  went to VA hospital out here in Boyce and I was in there until June and I kept
[3:32:51.120 --> 3:32:54.560]  here in Dr. Group and all you guys talking about living defense. Let me
[3:32:54.560 --> 3:32:59.040]  tell you something man. I had an internal digestive problem and I suffered
[3:32:59.040 --> 3:33:02.800]  with it for about five or six years and the doctors they tried every test.
[3:33:02.800 --> 3:33:06.640]  Nobody could figure out what it is and then every day when I kept hearing you
[3:33:06.640 --> 3:33:09.920]  and Dr. Group and those commercials I said you know what I'm gonna get me some
[3:33:09.920 --> 3:33:12.920]  of that freaking living defense. Now I wasn't supposed to have any nutritional
[3:33:12.920 --> 3:33:15.920]  because they don't want you to have it stuff but I ordered it, had it shipped to
[3:33:15.920 --> 3:33:21.040]  me, I got it, I hid it from the nurses, I started taking it man. That stuff changed
[3:33:21.040 --> 3:33:24.800]  my life, it saved my life. If there's any veteran out there, I don't give you
[3:33:24.800 --> 3:33:29.440]  travel though, anybody's traveled overseas, you absolutely owe it to yourself to
[3:33:29.440 --> 3:33:34.120]  get two bottles of that living defense. It's true folks, we don't sell anything
[3:33:34.120 --> 3:33:38.480]  unless it's the highest quality and living defense is over the top good. You
[3:33:38.480 --> 3:33:43.960]  must guard your humanity. You must guard your children's humanity. You must guard
[3:33:43.960 --> 3:33:47.880]  the very genetic code of the planet. The globalists have set themselves up as the
[3:33:47.880 --> 3:33:52.360]  guardians of this world but they are the ones that are overriding every genetic
[3:33:52.360 --> 3:33:56.800]  system and poisoning the planet. They are the ones that are now engaged in
[3:33:56.800 --> 3:34:02.520]  genetic takeover of every human on earth through the GMO crops and now they've
[3:34:02.520 --> 3:34:07.160]  moved on to their main target, humanity with the mRNA vaccines which are not
[3:34:07.160 --> 3:34:14.880]  vaccines. They are recombinant DNA from aborted cloned fetuses where they
[3:34:14.880 --> 3:34:20.600]  inserted it into your genome to take over your body's systems. Go read the
[3:34:20.600 --> 3:34:27.360]  actual inserts for the mRNA vaccines and then remember you've been warned. This
[3:34:27.360 --> 3:34:31.160]  is the equivalent of an alien takeover. Whether it's interdimensional, whether
[3:34:31.160 --> 3:34:34.520]  it's little green men, the globalists are acting like another species that's
[3:34:34.520 --> 3:34:39.200]  overtaking us and overriding us. It's all the same in the end.
[3:34:40.360 --> 3:34:45.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:34:51.200 --> 3:35:03.800]  When the evening sun goes down. Okay we're back here. Last segment. I'm going to try to
[3:35:03.800 --> 3:35:10.040]  lay out the rest of this and jam it all in about the vaccine. What about the
[3:35:10.040 --> 3:35:16.440]  effectiveness of the COVID vaccine? I've discussed this before on the show. I want to
[3:35:16.440 --> 3:35:24.000]  sum it up. In a groundbreaking opinion piece in the New York Times by Peter
[3:35:24.000 --> 3:35:29.400]  Doshi and Eric Topol, they took apart the clinical trials of the three major
[3:35:29.400 --> 3:35:37.720]  companies, Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca, and they said, look, these clinical
[3:35:37.720 --> 3:35:45.360]  trials, which led to the approval of the Pfizer COVID vaccine, are designed to
[3:35:45.360 --> 3:35:57.160]  only prevent mild, mild cases of COVID-19, meaning chills and fever or cough. That's
[3:35:57.160 --> 3:36:06.360]  it. They're not designed to show that the vaccine can prevent serious cases,
[3:36:06.360 --> 3:36:12.680]  hospitalization type cases, deaths, not at all. That's not the way they're built
[3:36:12.680 --> 3:36:17.720]  or structured. And there's reasoning behind this, which I've gone into in
[3:36:17.720 --> 3:36:22.760]  detail on the show before and in articles, but what they say stands up
[3:36:22.760 --> 3:36:29.640]  completely. These clinical trials of the vaccine are complete fraud from the point
[3:36:29.640 --> 3:36:35.240]  of view of being effective or showing effectiveness of the vaccine, because who
[3:36:35.240 --> 3:36:43.880]  cares about a cough or chills and fever? These cure themselves naturally. There is
[3:36:43.880 --> 3:36:50.120]  no need for a vaccine, but that's what the clinical trials were designed to
[3:36:50.120 --> 3:36:55.640]  prove and nothing more. So when you see all the celebrations, oh, we're rolling
[3:36:55.640 --> 3:37:01.640]  out this fantastic vaccine, no, it isn't fantastic. Even if you believe, which I
[3:37:01.640 --> 3:37:07.640]  do not, in conventional vaccine theory, even if you were to brush aside the
[3:37:07.640 --> 3:37:13.640]  monstrous adverse effects and the dangers of the vaccine, which I've
[3:37:13.640 --> 3:37:17.800]  described to you over the last 40 minutes, and nobody should brush those
[3:37:17.800 --> 3:37:21.880]  sides if they care about living.
[3:37:22.760 --> 3:37:28.520]  The effectiveness angle is complete fraud. There is no effectiveness here for
[3:37:28.520 --> 3:37:33.880]  anything serious or anything that people should be worried about.
[3:37:33.880 --> 3:37:39.240]  But the press overlooks this. They publish one piece and then forget about it,
[3:37:39.240 --> 3:37:44.840]  move on. The public health officials like Fauci, they don't care,
[3:37:44.840 --> 3:37:50.040]  they know they don't say anything. The coronavirus task force, they say nothing
[3:37:50.040 --> 3:37:53.960]  about any of this. The vaccine makers, they're silent, they
[3:37:53.960 --> 3:37:58.520]  say nothing about it. The public health agencies like the
[3:37:58.520 --> 3:38:02.920]  World Health Organization, CDC, they know what I've just described to you,
[3:38:02.920 --> 3:38:06.440]  they say nothing about it.
[3:38:07.560 --> 3:38:13.160]  They're putting into effect a killer machine, which is a vaccine,
[3:38:13.160 --> 3:38:17.640]  and they don't want any interruption in their plan,
[3:38:17.640 --> 3:38:22.280]  in their plan. And I want to now move along and describe
[3:38:22.280 --> 3:38:26.280]  yet another facet of this, which from a commercial point of view
[3:38:26.280 --> 3:38:30.200]  is vitally important to understand.
[3:38:30.360 --> 3:38:35.400]  Because from a money point of strictly speaking,
[3:38:35.400 --> 3:38:40.840]  this is the first product in the history of the human race
[3:38:40.840 --> 3:38:46.760]  to introduce RNA technology. No drug or vaccine has ever been
[3:38:46.760 --> 3:38:50.440]  foisted upon the public with this technology.
[3:38:50.440 --> 3:38:55.560]  And here's what that means from a commercial point of view.
[3:38:56.280 --> 3:39:04.120]  Vaccines can now be produced much more cheaply, easily, and quickly.
[3:39:04.120 --> 3:39:07.320]  It's not a matter of years anymore, it's a matter of
[3:39:07.320 --> 3:39:15.080]  months, quickly, cheaply, more easily.
[3:39:15.880 --> 3:39:20.360]  Do you understand what this implies for the future?
[3:39:21.080 --> 3:39:25.240]  They can now say the Bill Gates is of this world. Well, we've discovered 15 new
[3:39:25.240 --> 3:39:28.680]  viruses that we've never known about before, and
[3:39:28.680 --> 3:39:33.080]  we can roll out vaccines for all of them in a matter of months
[3:39:33.080 --> 3:39:37.080]  and subject the human race to more toxicity and more destruction and more
[3:39:37.080 --> 3:39:41.000]  death. Because we've got RNA technology and
[3:39:41.000 --> 3:39:45.320]  it's finally been approved in one product, which means the door is wide
[3:39:45.320 --> 3:39:48.440]  open. We can now use it again and again and again,
[3:39:48.440 --> 3:39:51.240]  and nobody's going to inspect it or look into it
[3:39:51.240 --> 3:39:56.680]  about the horrendous adverse effects and about the lack of effectiveness, etc, etc.
[3:39:56.680 --> 3:40:00.840]  It's all going to go away now, and the way is clear.
[3:40:00.840 --> 3:40:04.680]  And what this is pointing to in the future, and I just want to
[3:40:04.680 --> 3:40:09.720]  paint the picture briefly of this, is the following.
[3:40:09.720 --> 3:40:14.760]  People will show up at their doctor's offices or the hospitals or people will
[3:40:14.760 --> 3:40:20.280]  come to their homes or whatever, and they'll be given a routine
[3:40:20.280 --> 3:40:26.120]  DNA profile. Everybody will have one, it'll be on record,
[3:40:26.120 --> 3:40:30.200]  records will be shared with everybody, etc, etc.
[3:40:30.200 --> 3:40:36.120]  And then the honchos at public health agencies and government leaders will then
[3:40:36.120 --> 3:40:41.480]  be able to say, and they will say, for every DNA profile
[3:40:41.480 --> 3:40:48.760]  we can show you and we will give you a customized set of vaccines that you
[3:40:48.760 --> 3:40:52.280]  need in order to survive in this world.
[3:40:52.280 --> 3:40:58.200]  Because we can produce these vaccines in record time,
[3:40:58.200 --> 3:41:02.920]  and we have them in stocks on board, and we're ready to go.
[3:41:02.920 --> 3:41:07.720]  So you have a DNA profile of a little bit of this and 3% of that,
[3:41:07.720 --> 3:41:13.800]  7% of this and 47%. Okay, great. We've got that. We know that.
[3:41:13.800 --> 3:41:17.880]  We've got all the potential DNA profile. All of this is complete,
[3:41:17.880 --> 3:41:22.360]  baloney, of course. I mean, this is all hoax, it's all hype,
[3:41:22.360 --> 3:41:26.600]  but that's what they're saying, and it sounds good. It's techno-speak, it's
[3:41:26.600 --> 3:41:31.720]  fake science, it's from the top. Oh yes, the experts say.
[3:41:31.720 --> 3:41:39.080]  So now we've got John Jones. Your set of vaccines attuned precisely
[3:41:39.080 --> 3:41:43.320]  to your DNA profile, and we're going to give them to you.
[3:41:43.320 --> 3:41:46.280]  And in three days you'll have them all, and then
[3:41:46.280 --> 3:41:49.400]  three months later you'll come back from boosters, and every year you'll get
[3:41:49.400 --> 3:41:53.880]  more boosters, and we'll do a new profile on you just to make
[3:41:53.880 --> 3:41:59.240]  sure that we had it right and blah, blah, blah, blah.
[3:41:59.240 --> 3:42:05.080]  Medical tyranny, you're a medical patient from
[3:42:05.080 --> 3:42:10.920]  the ovum to the grave. That's the deal. The medical cartel, the most powerful
[3:42:10.920 --> 3:42:14.600]  cartel in the world. It's medical dictatorship, medical
[3:42:14.600 --> 3:42:18.440]  police state, it's globalism all rolled into one,
[3:42:18.440 --> 3:42:26.200]  technocracy, that's what is happening with these vaccines. That's the deal.
[3:42:26.200 --> 3:42:31.240]  People die, people fall over, people get sick, long term they die, quickly they
[3:42:31.240 --> 3:42:34.360]  die, doesn't matter, it's all going to be written off as
[3:42:34.360 --> 3:42:37.720]  something else that has nothing to do with the vaccine.
[3:42:37.720 --> 3:42:43.560]  And then, as I've described before on the show here,
[3:42:43.560 --> 3:42:51.320]  the case numbers of COVID will be rigged. Very easy to do by adjusting
[3:42:51.320 --> 3:42:56.760]  the PCR test. I've explained that, I've gone into detail on how that works.
[3:42:56.760 --> 3:43:00.280]  You make adjustments on how the PCR test is done,
[3:43:00.280 --> 3:43:04.280]  and you come up with, now suddenly, a majority,
[3:43:04.280 --> 3:43:08.520]  a vast majority of negative reactions, which means
[3:43:08.520 --> 3:43:13.640]  people are not infected by the fake virus.
[3:43:13.640 --> 3:43:17.720]  And therefore, the case numbers go down, or the appearance
[3:43:17.720 --> 3:43:23.960]  of the case numbers goes down. And then, the fouches of this world say, you see,
[3:43:23.960 --> 3:43:28.520]  it's because of the vaccine. The vaccine is working wonders.
[3:43:28.520 --> 3:43:32.440]  It's a miracle. We are conquering the pandemic.
[3:43:32.440 --> 3:43:39.320]  All hail to Pfizer and BioNTech and Moderna and AstraZeneca, etc, etc, etc.
[3:43:39.320 --> 3:43:43.480]  The miracle workers and the messiahs that are saving humankind,
[3:43:43.480 --> 3:43:50.440]  we must rely on them forever in the future to save us from future pandemics, etc, etc, etc.
[3:43:50.440 --> 3:43:54.280]  That's the game plan. That's the deal.
[3:43:54.280 --> 3:44:05.400]  Harm. Disabilities incurred. Making people disabled, unable to function.
[3:44:06.360 --> 3:44:11.560]  Die off of the frail and elderly and other people. Depopulation.
[3:44:14.280 --> 3:44:18.040]  Reducing the ability of people to resist the takeover.
[3:44:18.040 --> 3:44:26.520]  This is the long-term effect of vaccines. And it is now being accelerated.
[3:44:27.240 --> 3:44:31.080]  And the program is to try, at different levels and different ways,
[3:44:31.080 --> 3:44:34.760]  to mandate the vaccine through corporations, through companies,
[3:44:34.760 --> 3:44:40.120]  through states, governors, in other countries, through provinces,
[3:44:40.120 --> 3:44:45.320]  and prime ministers, etc, etc, etc. To put everybody under the gun,
[3:44:45.320 --> 3:44:51.720]  which means everybody who is awake and aware has to resist and rebel against this.
[3:44:51.720 --> 3:44:55.320]  They know we're out there. They know we know the truth.
[3:44:55.320 --> 3:45:00.440]  They know that there are larger and larger numbers of people who are ready to resist.
[3:45:00.440 --> 3:45:08.200]  And that's us. So that's what we have to do against the vaccine, against the destruction.
[3:45:08.200 --> 3:45:16.280]  On behalf of strength, vitality, health, consciousness, and freedom above all,
[3:45:16.280 --> 3:45:20.360]  to say, no, we're going to live our lives the way we want to.
[3:45:20.360 --> 3:45:38.040]  John Mappaport, see you next time.
