[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:29.360]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:29.360 --> 00:39.120]  Gonzo journalism is not my goal but historically long before Hunter S. Thompson
[00:39.120 --> 00:44.760]  coined that term muckrakers going back a hundred years ago or more would
[00:44.760 --> 00:48.680]  routinely end up in the story because they would go out and try to report on
[00:48.680 --> 00:52.720]  corporate and government and individual corruption and have people come after
[00:52.720 --> 01:00.440]  them in many cases being imprisoned or killed and when you live in a empire of
[01:00.440 --> 01:07.000]  lies and fraud when you live in a panopticon of universal deceit telling the
[01:07.000 --> 01:19.560]  truth to paraphrase George Arwell is a revolutionary act and I knew Friday when
[01:19.560 --> 01:27.160]  they started saying it was an anti TSA person I knew that I would be blamed by
[01:27.160 --> 01:31.560]  Saturday and I was and I've been too busy to call them back plus what's the
[01:31.560 --> 01:35.320]  point they'll write whatever they want AP Reuters you name it they've all been
[01:35.320 --> 01:39.760]  calling her yesterday and today and I mean I guess at some point you just don't
[01:39.760 --> 01:42.960]  call them back anymore because you know they'll just use it to act like they
[01:42.960 --> 01:46.480]  engage in some type of journalistic research and they just use you as a
[01:46.480 --> 01:57.640]  projection as a screen to broadcast and project their lies onto you you know
[01:57.640 --> 02:01.000]  we've seen and I've got Darren McBrain getting clips of this together right now
[02:01.000 --> 02:15.240]  just this year CNN MSNBC Fox News ABC news the list goes on and on do things
[02:15.240 --> 02:24.640]  like have a report on sexual cyber stalking I don't have any history or
[02:24.640 --> 02:29.960]  any any charges or any claims of sexual cyber stalking I have no criminal
[02:29.960 --> 02:34.760]  record period there's no news stories about such a thing I don't even use
[02:34.760 --> 02:40.840]  email I'm almost a troglodyte and with no proof Bill O'Reilly says we've got to
[02:40.840 --> 02:47.440]  stop these online sexual perverts that are attacking women and he cuts to an
[02:47.440 --> 02:53.480]  image of me ranting about the New World Order killing millions of people in
[02:53.480 --> 03:00.720]  Iraq edits it out to make it sound like I'm talking about killing women it'd be
[03:00.720 --> 03:05.400]  like if you had a report about Jeffrey Dahmer and then you just cut to a clip of
[03:05.400 --> 03:12.320]  me for no reason out of context and they said I'm behind the Boston bombing they
[03:12.320 --> 03:15.880]  said that I said Obama sent a tornado to Oklahoma City I didn't say any such
[03:15.880 --> 03:24.680]  thing they said I'm deeply racist and and look I've had state-run media attack
[03:24.680 --> 03:30.920]  me for 18 years I was being attacked by state-run media within one year of
[03:30.920 --> 03:35.080]  being on the air nationally I was on access television and a local radio show
[03:35.080 --> 03:38.800]  and they were so upset by it they they would come in try to shut me down and
[03:38.800 --> 03:41.640]  actually got me thrown off the radio the government came and threatened the
[03:41.640 --> 03:46.800]  station and that ended up in in the newspapers I mean I've experienced DPS
[03:46.800 --> 03:53.400]  intelligence on my butt state police when I was you know 22 years old so I've
[03:53.400 --> 03:57.400]  already been through this a lot but stuff people wouldn't believe I'm not
[03:57.400 --> 04:00.960]  gonna I start thinking of all the stuff I've gone through it's it's beyond any
[04:00.960 --> 04:06.760]  movie I mean it's ridiculous how truth is strange or the fiction feel like Roy
[04:06.760 --> 04:13.760]  Batty or something I've seen things you people wouldn't believe fiery the angels
[04:13.760 --> 04:20.440]  fell deep thunder rolled around their shores burning with the fires of orc but
[04:20.440 --> 04:29.640]  the point is that it is that we are so accurate and so hitting the sweet spot
[04:29.640 --> 04:35.000]  the missing scales on the dragon dragon's belly that they're all coming after us
[04:35.000 --> 04:42.080]  and now say there's a shadowy subculture that influenced the shooter and then it
[04:42.080 --> 04:45.480]  cuts to me and then it cuts back to the reporter Diane Sawyer and they're like
[04:45.480 --> 04:51.800]  you're not allowed to kill people Alex it's basically the message and and you
[04:51.800 --> 04:55.880]  know something this is a good thing it shows we're really hurting them bad
[04:55.880 --> 05:03.520]  they'll be back I had tried everything I'd cut back the amount of food I was
[05:03.520 --> 05:07.880]  eating I was lifting weights and jogging but nothing was working my body was
[05:07.880 --> 05:11.680]  literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins
[05:11.680 --> 05:16.480]  and as soon as I had that I immediately could eat half of what I was eating

[08:17.720 --> 08:26.960]  immortal wisest and fairest of all beings seven to the dwarf lords great miners
[08:26.960 --> 08:34.440]  and craftsmen of the mountain halls and nine nine rings were gifted to the race
[08:34.440 --> 08:42.400]  of men who above all else desire power for within these rings was bound the
[08:42.400 --> 08:51.040]  strength and will to govern each race but they were all of them deceived for
[08:51.040 --> 08:57.920]  another ring was made in the land of Mordor in the fires of mount doom the
[08:57.920 --> 09:04.800]  dark lord Sauron forged in secret a master ring to control all others and
[09:04.800 --> 09:10.720]  into this ring he poured his cruelty his malice and his will to dominate all
[09:10.720 --> 09:32.080]  life one ring to rule the war the Alex Jones show because there is a war on for
[09:32.080 --> 09:40.640]  your life they had a saying in world war two for fighter bomber pilots
[09:40.640 --> 09:46.640]  flying in over continental Europe and North Africa they knew even in cloudy
[09:46.640 --> 09:52.360]  weather or when the factory and military sites were putting up smoke were to
[09:52.360 --> 10:00.160]  attack because they would put place flak in rings around the main target and so
[10:00.160 --> 10:06.600]  you flew into the flat cloud into the center of it long before they had gps
[10:06.600 --> 10:13.120]  ladies and gentlemen to then visually see the factories and bomb them and it's
[10:13.120 --> 10:18.040]  when you're over the target that you've got the big guns firing at you and I
[10:18.040 --> 10:22.320]  want to make something clear info wars.com myself my whole crew we are
[10:22.320 --> 10:30.080]  purposely flying directly into the flat cloud and it's when we draw the heavy
[10:30.080 --> 10:36.640]  flak that we know we're right over the target now we've got the establishment
[10:36.640 --> 10:42.880]  super freaked out because they know that a lot of new media alternative media
[10:42.880 --> 10:46.960]  real media and even some of the sub level state-run media that's not fully
[10:46.960 --> 10:50.880]  under their control it's more socially controlled by the types of folks they
[10:50.880 --> 10:56.120]  put in the positions but they're not consciously globalist collaborators they
[10:56.120 --> 11:04.240]  know that the info this show puts out becomes a map of the mind becomes a
[11:04.240 --> 11:10.360]  guide wire a trail of breadcrumbs for others to then go do their own research
[11:10.360 --> 11:15.440]  and discover more than I've discovered all it takes is just barely investigating
[11:15.440 --> 11:20.520]  you scratch anywhere and just tyranny pours out corruption evil just oozes out
[11:20.520 --> 11:26.640]  the whole world marvels at America's transformation in the last 20 years into
[11:26.640 --> 11:30.920]  this great tyranny but you still have vestiges of the old Republic
[11:30.920 --> 11:35.800]  simultaneously operating it isn't like we're czarist Russia with a history of
[11:35.800 --> 11:40.800]  serfs and basically slaves taken over by even greater slavery so the people are
[11:40.800 --> 11:45.960]  already prepared for it it isn't like Germany very smart hard-working folks
[11:45.960 --> 11:51.360]  but a history of serfdom slavery and following orders famously following
[11:51.360 --> 11:55.400]  orders the best soldiers were Germans because they would march right into the
[11:55.400 --> 12:00.480]  gunfire when ordered to do so they were purchased by the British and others for
[12:00.480 --> 12:05.760]  use against the American people here when we were the colonies
[12:05.760 --> 12:10.200]  America has been different and it is because we are so evil and we are so
[12:10.200 --> 12:14.300]  good at the same time we are swashbucklers we come from freebooters we
[12:14.300 --> 12:18.400]  come from pirates we come from smugglers we come from preachers we come
[12:18.400 --> 12:24.280]  from slaves we come from warriors we come from inventors trailblazers and the
[12:24.280 --> 12:28.920]  future destiny of the world many historians have pointed out rest and
[12:28.920 --> 12:35.760]  hangs will evil succeed and take over and use America's might to establish a
[12:35.760 --> 12:39.880]  planetary world government or will this be the battleground of intellectual
[12:39.880 --> 12:44.320]  ideas where we seize the day and reverse the criminal tide that is the
[12:44.320 --> 12:51.200]  great question and I've studied basic military history I've also studied not
[12:51.200 --> 12:54.640]  what you see in the news or on the history channel about military maneuvers
[12:54.640 --> 13:01.320]  but the secret police the takeover arms the purges the way they establish these
[13:01.320 --> 13:07.120]  forces I've studied this at a very deep level probably more than even most top
[13:07.120 --> 13:10.640]  generals because they're mainly focused on current force structure and fighting
[13:10.640 --> 13:17.360]  the last war and maintaining political status I have read no exaggeration 500
[13:17.360 --> 13:22.040]  history books thousands of Smithsonian other magazine articles about history of
[13:22.040 --> 13:28.440]  never perspectives I have read probably 50 books on psychological warfare
[13:28.440 --> 13:32.480]  operations I've read hundreds of public white papers and show them to you here
[13:32.480 --> 13:38.600]  on air so you can read them with different secret police operations the
[13:38.600 --> 13:42.720]  better known are things like Operation Valkyrie using a system like that to
[13:42.720 --> 13:47.880]  reverse engineer and bring down the tyrant and so when I look at what's
[13:47.880 --> 13:52.960]  going on I know multi moves out what they're planning and what they're going
[13:52.960 --> 13:57.920]  to do and it's not very hard by the way once you get in this battle space and
[13:57.920 --> 14:02.440]  once you study the history of it and once you understand it it's it's there
[14:02.440 --> 14:08.640]  operating in 100% full view and they're not like the flash racing back and
[14:08.640 --> 14:14.160]  forth it's in slow motion we don't know the hour or the time that they launch
[14:14.160 --> 14:17.280]  their specific operations we don't know which card they'll play but we know all
[14:17.280 --> 14:22.520]  the cards in their hand and that's why I need you the listeners to find all this
[14:22.520 --> 14:26.480]  just to show new listeners the last month I probably said 20 times on
[14:26.480 --> 14:30.840]  air or more they're going to stage a mass shooting and a TSA line they're
[14:30.840 --> 14:36.560]  going to stage that to then arm the TSA we even did reports about it and we
[14:36.560 --> 14:40.360]  need to have everybody that finds that uploaded to YouTube and just say Alex
[14:40.360 --> 14:46.160]  Jones predicts lax shooting is not asking my crew for days and they're just
[14:46.160 --> 14:50.200]  overwhelmed they hasn't been dug up but but everyone knows I've said this
[14:50.200 --> 14:53.760]  everyone knows I've broken this down I told you you're gonna start seeing IED
[14:53.760 --> 14:57.560]  bombings around the country that'll be blamed on shadowy groups so they can
[14:57.560 --> 15:02.160]  never exactly find out who it is or stop it and then that will be projected and
[15:02.160 --> 15:06.760]  blamed on the Tea Party libertarians conservatives returning veterans gun
[15:06.760 --> 15:15.160]  owners this is a classic false flag operation this has been done this is in
[15:15.160 --> 15:19.400]  army manuals that wiki leaks released the army admitted it's a real manual how
[15:19.400 --> 15:28.040]  to stage false flags the US armies taught this it's a fact okay now a false
[15:28.040 --> 15:31.040]  flag is you'll blow up a market if you're overwhelmed and blame it on your
[15:31.040 --> 15:35.720]  political enemy to try to get the entire town to turn to your special forces a
[15:35.720 --> 15:39.720]  team to then lead them against the larger grip is coming in and the argument
[15:39.720 --> 15:44.680]  is if you blow up five or six villagers and wound 20 or 30 you'll get 10,000
[15:44.680 --> 15:48.600]  villagers behind you in the town and then your argument is you're doing this
[15:48.600 --> 15:53.280]  so they don't turn to the greater evil of communism and that is how the path of
[15:53.280 --> 15:59.720]  evil is basically accepted is they good men are told we do horrible things for
[15:59.720 --> 16:03.360]  the greater good but really you're just converting over to an authoritarian model
[16:03.360 --> 16:08.840]  as well so they're very upset that the military listens to me the power
[16:08.840 --> 16:13.640]  structure is is absolutely tearing their hair out and they don't like their own
[16:13.640 --> 16:17.640]  high-level operatives either who are pretty compartmentalized and worldly and
[16:17.640 --> 16:21.040]  pretty much into their party time they just carry out their operations as
[16:21.040 --> 16:25.160]  mercenaries they don't like all this being openly discussed we told you a
[16:25.160 --> 16:28.680]  month and a half ago there was a major purge in the brass it's now all over the
[16:28.680 --> 16:32.520]  news today and confirmed we're gonna be getting into that we told you there's
[16:32.520 --> 16:35.600]  missing nukes folks that's a real story you think I like coming up here and
[16:35.600 --> 16:40.040]  saying that that's just asking to be killed but I have honor I will report the
[16:40.040 --> 16:44.920]  truth why do you think they have all the Cointel pro infighter operatives with
[16:44.920 --> 16:48.200]  all their government connections and backgrounds stirring up and attacking
[16:48.200 --> 16:51.280]  and saying I'm not real and I'm not legitimate it's because ladies and
[16:51.280 --> 16:56.720]  gentlemen we are totally legitimate completely honorable completely real and
[16:56.720 --> 17:03.360]  upfront and that's clear to anyone with discernment to know we are 1776 reborn
[17:03.360 --> 17:09.680]  you are 1776 reborn there are good men and women in this world and in the
[17:09.680 --> 17:12.920]  government there are a lot of good people this morning I was talking to Paul
[17:12.920 --> 17:17.480]  Watson before I get to our top story and why I'm discussing this and I said I
[17:17.480 --> 17:20.840]  want I go I know you realize just how real all this is that we've been
[17:20.840 --> 17:26.240]  absolutely spot-on about the prognosis it was hidden in plain view and and this
[17:26.240 --> 17:31.120]  is it this is history and I said I'm glad you're committed Watson he said no I
[17:31.120 --> 17:39.160]  know it's all real and then some and we were we were mourning together as two
[17:39.160 --> 17:47.160]  men mourning the fact that we are in a death battle with a giant globalist
[17:47.160 --> 17:51.880]  boa constrictor wrapped around a squeezing a life out of this country to
[17:51.880 --> 17:56.800]  absolutely break this Republic illegal spying secret arrest torture teams
[17:56.800 --> 18:01.600]  FEMA camps and folks I don't tell you the truth about this to scare you I
[18:01.600 --> 18:05.840]  tell it to you because you got to admit how much trouble we're in to turn this
[18:05.840 --> 18:10.880]  around and that's why they hate us they want just incrementally everybody to
[18:10.880 --> 18:18.920]  just go along with this stage mass shootings at schools TSA facilities to
[18:18.920 --> 18:25.200]  make them the victims highway checkpoints I mean I could see right into
[18:25.200 --> 18:28.160]  what they're gonna do plus I see in the movies the sitcoms the dramas and the
[18:28.160 --> 18:32.120]  drills they're doing and I said just a few weeks ago even had an article about
[18:32.120 --> 18:38.120]  it you heard me listeners I said over and over again I said they keep saying
[18:38.120 --> 18:42.360]  they want to arm the TSA they're afraid of a mass shooting they're gonna use
[18:42.360 --> 18:49.040]  that as the drill to have some informant or somebody who thinks they're part of a
[18:49.040 --> 18:52.440]  drill and I've told police they want to demonize police next so that's coming
[18:52.440 --> 18:55.560]  next and go for the good cops and purge them and military I said if you're in
[18:55.560 --> 18:58.680]  the military if you're in domestic operations do not be part of these
[18:58.680 --> 19:02.520]  drills say you're sick refuse because hey they may have a hundred drills until
[19:02.520 --> 19:06.120]  you go to one one day and there and you're gonna be in a drill and they're
[19:06.120 --> 19:09.760]  going to shoot you in the back of the head and then they're gonna shoot a
[19:09.760 --> 19:15.880]  bunch of people and say you did it and looking at this first approximation it's
[19:15.880 --> 19:20.960]  a false flag just like with Boston bombing there was a drill the police
[19:20.960 --> 19:25.280]  chief admitted in LA they know we had a drill this just last week and two guys
[19:25.280 --> 19:29.440]  behind him I showed this two days ago on Sunday grabbed their mouths like the
[19:29.440 --> 19:36.280]  two feds go oh I mean you know and now again I'm not even saying the police
[19:36.280 --> 19:40.880]  themselves are involved you only need a couple people to do this and again it's
[19:40.880 --> 19:46.240]  declassified they use drills do this before the hijackers on 9-11 thought
[19:46.240 --> 19:50.080]  they were part of the hijacking drill that you could say was a triple cross
[19:50.080 --> 19:53.880]  and that they were really al-qaeda operatives whatever the point is they
[19:53.880 --> 19:58.080]  were CIA officers the head of the defense language school went public
[19:58.080 --> 20:03.280]  Colonel Butler every day it becomes more clear our nation is headed towards an

[23:50.920 --> 24:06.080]  every front it is essential to prepare with my patriot supply today
[24:20.920 --> 24:38.040]  well ladies and gentlemen I broke down some of the background of what's
[24:38.040 --> 24:45.960]  happening in this country there is an authoritarian takeover of the republic
[24:45.960 --> 24:50.880]  taking place a designed program to bankrupt the nation and bring us into debt
[24:50.880 --> 24:56.440]  bondage and it's all on record and then meanwhile we have a backdrop of fast
[24:56.440 --> 25:00.960]  and furious our government funding al-qaeda the salindra deals all the
[25:00.960 --> 25:07.720]  scams obama care being a giant fraud and obama comes out yesterday and to a
[25:07.720 --> 25:12.680]  group of supporters we're gonna play this coming up and says I never said you
[25:12.680 --> 25:16.880]  could keep your health plan even though we have 29 times on video including a
[25:16.880 --> 25:19.520]  state of the Union
[25:21.840 --> 25:27.240]  meanwhile that's not the news in the controlled state-run media the news it
[25:27.240 --> 25:34.400]  was almost like comedy last night I was here at the office late night working and
[25:34.400 --> 25:42.680]  I was watching CNN and MSNBC back and forth and they were like breathlessly
[25:42.680 --> 25:48.680]  going ran Paul the criminal the plagiar he's so horrible so I went and looked up
[25:48.680 --> 25:52.200]  what it was and it was out of over a thousand speeches over a hundred
[25:52.200 --> 25:58.480]  articles he's written he paraphrased a quote which is a paraphrase of something
[25:58.480 --> 26:02.080]  I've said when everybody says forever we have the largest prison population in
[26:02.080 --> 26:13.160]  the world bigger than China and Iran combined and then there's statistics and
[26:13.160 --> 26:19.200]  then they go oh look that was once in a newspaper apologize Apollo or he once
[26:19.200 --> 26:23.760]  gave a speech that had something similar I mean this is getting to be crazy
[26:23.760 --> 26:29.260]  land ladies and gentlemen it's not like it's Fareed Zarkaria who like has whole
[26:29.260 --> 26:34.040]  paragraphs of someone else's speech and says it's his and is a writer we're
[26:34.040 --> 26:39.360]  talking about giving speeches here you've got manifest evil going on manifest
[26:39.360 --> 26:43.200]  corruption and the reason I mentioned that is it just shows how they set up
[26:43.200 --> 26:46.200]  there with a bunch of their own people agreeing to try to create a false
[26:46.200 --> 26:49.800]  consensus and they know exactly what they're doing now move into our top
[26:49.800 --> 26:57.720]  story up on info wars.com ABC News implicates Alex Jones in LAX shooting
[26:57.720 --> 27:01.520]  this is ABC Nightly News
[27:04.560 --> 27:09.160]  here's the next one good morning America depicts LAX gum and with grenade
[27:09.160 --> 27:14.680]  launcher and they say shouldn't we ban M16 rifles when you can't even get an
[27:14.680 --> 27:19.040]  M16 rifle it's an M4 they show a grenade launcher to make people think like oh
[27:19.040 --> 27:23.440]  citizens have that see how this works folks and all you got to do is have a
[27:23.440 --> 27:29.120]  drill and then start shooting people or if it was really mentally ill or
[27:29.120 --> 27:32.920]  something because we always call for not having violence not being offensive
[27:32.920 --> 27:36.000]  they'll use that against us even if statistically you got a better chance
[27:36.000 --> 27:41.760]  being killed by a honeybee than being shot by some patriot gun owner they're
[27:41.760 --> 27:44.680]  still gonna wave the bloody shirt and play the part of victims do not go out I
[27:44.680 --> 27:49.760]  even said if they abuse people or if they attack you and it's on camera and
[27:49.760 --> 27:55.240]  out in the public if you don't respond like Gandhi they will lose I'm really
[27:55.240 --> 28:01.040]  trying to be like Gandhi or Martin Luther King or Christ like and say
[28:01.040 --> 28:05.320]  there's a time to fight in a time to not fight back if they start mass roundups
[28:05.320 --> 28:08.880]  and start killing people and sending out death squads then obviously you've got
[28:08.880 --> 28:12.720]  a the best defense is a good offense but and this is all we've been talking
[28:12.720 --> 28:17.400]  about you can see the scripting in every movie every TV show children's
[28:17.400 --> 28:21.680]  cartoons every week we do a report where on all these shows the gun owners
[28:21.680 --> 28:26.240]  kill the cops kill the children and a racist terrorist and anybody with a
[28:26.240 --> 28:29.800]  don't tread on me flags of terrorists so now the Marines are being told get rid
[28:29.800 --> 28:33.360]  of it the Navy SEALs are being told don't use it when they've been using it
[28:33.360 --> 28:40.720]  that the Army the Navy and the Marine Corps have been using the don't tread on
[28:40.720 --> 28:46.520]  me symbol for 230 plus years in fact the don't tread on me predates the

[28:52.040 --> 28:58.360]  militia flag I mean this is like banning the American flag I'm gonna go to
[28:58.360 --> 29:01.280]  break and give you the big story when we come back but the Navy SEALs are
[29:01.280 --> 29:04.360]  having to take them off the Marines are taking they're taking about it bases
[29:04.360 --> 29:09.480]  because they have the politically correct authoritarian say I'm offended by
[29:09.480 --> 29:15.320]  that flag the original flag is red stripes and white stripes predates the
[29:15.320 --> 29:20.560]  American flag with us with the rattlesnake across it that is one of the
[29:20.560 --> 29:26.520]  oldest Navy symbols in this country effectively research it was John Paul
[29:26.520 --> 29:31.240]  Jones adopted it after some of his first battles you know where he'd fight
[29:31.240 --> 29:35.080]  ships four times his size and would be sinking and they'd say surrendered he
[29:35.080 --> 29:39.440]  said I've only begun to fight and would still defeat them well the folks that
[29:39.440 --> 29:42.640]  have taken our country over they say it's extremist and they're banning it

[33:32.040 --> 33:37.080]  simply promote the Bill of Rights the Constitution due process and basic
[33:37.080 --> 33:42.280]  liberty private property family rights states rights national sovereignty
[33:42.280 --> 33:52.080]  transparency and government stable monetary system basic freedom and I very
[33:52.080 --> 33:57.520]  clearly document what is completely apparent to everyone now who has any
[33:57.520 --> 34:03.120]  brain cells or who isn't living in Alice in Wonderland level denial that we are
[34:03.120 --> 34:08.560]  going off the edge of a cliff into a tyrannical authoritarian
[34:08.560 --> 34:14.240]  kleptocratic death spiral I mean just look at everything that's happening look
[34:14.240 --> 34:18.280]  at the lies and look at the government with Congress with a 10% approval
[34:18.280 --> 34:24.720]  rating and the mainstream media with a what is it 16 17% approval rating and
[34:24.720 --> 34:29.480]  then they still sit up there though and act like anyone that sees through their
[34:29.480 --> 34:35.640]  fraud 80 plus percent of us whether it's on the JFK assassination the numbers are
[34:35.640 --> 34:40.560]  all the same 85 to 90% of Americans do not believe the official story of
[34:40.560 --> 34:45.000]  anything anymore and you shouldn't from known liars if you had a neighbor that
[34:45.000 --> 34:49.600]  you caught lying 50 times to you would you still continue to associate with
[34:49.600 --> 34:55.840]  them and believe a word they said and so they've gotten of course to pick me
[34:55.840 --> 34:59.720]  out and we're going to put a piece together just showing the clips there
[34:59.720 --> 35:03.840]  McBrain's doing it right now maybe ready by the third hour maybe the second so I
[35:03.840 --> 35:07.680]  can show TV viewers but also radio listeners can hear it we're below Riley
[35:07.680 --> 35:13.640]  this year said we have sexual predators using online computers and Facebook and
[35:13.640 --> 35:18.240]  Twitter to harass women and it's horrible what they're doing to women and it
[35:18.240 --> 35:23.040]  cuts to me in a clip talking about the globalist and how they are killing
[35:23.040 --> 35:28.040]  people overseas in wars and gearing up for it domestically no relation it'd be
[35:28.040 --> 35:32.360]  like if they were doing a report on the NFL and then you just cut into a clip of
[35:32.360 --> 35:36.160]  Neil Armstrong walking on the moon or something I mean it just just just totally
[35:36.160 --> 35:42.440]  bizarro world cuts to me and shows my face turn red and I'm seeing this in
[35:42.440 --> 35:48.400]  movies and TV shows and everywhere they'll just attack me and in national
[35:48.400 --> 35:52.160]  comedy shows you don't go well we're not like the racist Alex Jones and then
[35:52.160 --> 35:57.880]  show no proof and they're targeting the people that don't even really pay
[35:57.880 --> 36:01.200]  attention to news they're targeting the general dumb down public and it shows
[36:01.200 --> 36:05.600]  what disdain they have Obama came out yesterday and this is coming up and said
[36:05.600 --> 36:12.160]  to his supporters in a speech I never said you could keep your insurance we're
[36:12.160 --> 36:15.680]  going to have to you know get rid of insurance if it doesn't cover what what
[36:15.680 --> 36:18.200]  the government sets the standards for which is what the insurance companies
[36:18.200 --> 36:21.480]  did no no it's people with existing full coverage it's doubling tripling
[36:21.480 --> 36:28.920]  quadrupling or more humanity here in Texas 539% increases for people who
[36:28.920 --> 36:34.560]  never even use their insurance families and so of course they can't answer that
[36:34.560 --> 36:40.800]  they're talking about having the Justice Department indict George Zimmerman now
[36:40.800 --> 36:47.040]  just to create more racial division and to create that diversion they shipped
[36:47.040 --> 36:53.400]  guns into Mexico this came out CBS News did their job which was very strange and
[36:53.400 --> 36:57.440]  rarely say that but the job CBS and sometimes 60 minutes actually does a
[36:57.440 --> 37:04.200]  good job because they know that's how you get viewers because it is to catch 22
[37:04.200 --> 37:09.080]  for the system do you do you ever tell the truth and get viewers or you just
[37:09.080 --> 37:12.720]  keep lying and have no viewers saving so so the point is is that they shipped
[37:12.720 --> 37:18.200]  tens of thousands of guns into Mexico to then get deaths down there to trace the
[37:18.200 --> 37:22.080]  guns back in a deal the Mexican government to then blame American gun
[37:22.080 --> 37:26.080]  owners so I mean that's another false flag folks these are such criminals they
[37:26.080 --> 37:32.480]  don't care about a dead TSA worker who I'm sad is dead they don't care about the
[37:32.480 --> 37:36.520]  six wounded anymore they care about a million plus dead Iraqis in the Gulf
[37:36.520 --> 37:42.240]  War go for two that's an official Lancet highly respected British Medical
[37:42.240 --> 37:47.520]  Journal accepted number took a million five last time I checked was a million
[37:47.520 --> 37:52.680]  two four years ago you think they care about you they're working around the
[37:52.680 --> 37:56.960]  clock to literally not let Africa industrialize and get electricity
[37:56.960 --> 38:00.920]  Obama goes there and says you're not allowed to have electricity even though
[38:00.920 --> 38:04.520]  it'll actually reduce their population because they'll stabilize they want them
[38:04.520 --> 38:10.600]  to live in total squalor and have ten kids hoping three of them live came out
[38:10.600 --> 38:15.200]  in the official UN documents it's a plan to reduce the development of those
[38:15.200 --> 38:18.840]  countries not their population it's the opposite of what they even say it's so
[38:18.840 --> 38:23.480]  incredible how diabolical these people are Obama trying to make Christian
[38:23.480 --> 38:29.160]  churches pay for abortions trying to persecute the Tea Party and libertarians
[38:29.160 --> 38:33.320]  and conservatives and have the IRS arrest people and set them up in directives
[38:33.320 --> 38:37.480]  and caught lying oh but they're not they're not bad doing all these hundreds
[38:37.480 --> 38:40.800]  of admitted crimes and putting our military under NATO command and funding
[38:40.800 --> 38:46.960]  al-Qaeda and not covering up Benghazi no Rand Paul is bad because he's a rising
[38:46.960 --> 38:50.080]  star and fought Obamacare has been proven right but they can't admit that
[38:50.080 --> 38:55.040]  says to be oh my gosh he might have been a speech plagiarized one line oh my
[38:55.040 --> 38:59.800]  goodness and forgot to attribute it oh my goodness goody-goody gun drops and I
[38:59.800 --> 39:03.640]  heard that one time he left the toothpaste cap off and then you know and
[39:03.640 --> 39:07.600]  he only wiped his hind in three times one day as well I mean this is just I
[39:07.600 --> 39:12.200]  mean ladies and gentlemen this is the dirtiest meanest guy in the world I'm
[39:12.200 --> 39:19.000]  the no Rand Paul he is literally a boy scout but smart they're scared of it same
[39:19.000 --> 39:23.960]  thing with Ted Cruz folks they are scared to death in all their inside
[39:23.960 --> 39:27.280]  documents all their public admissions that the Republican Party can be taken
[39:27.280 --> 39:30.320]  over by libertarians they've got the Republican and Democratic leadership all
[39:30.320 --> 39:33.000]  lining up against them and I told you they're gonna stage mass shootings and
[39:33.000 --> 39:37.720]  bombings folks they could nuke a city and say the Tea Party did with al-Qaeda
[39:37.720 --> 39:41.720]  you're like that makes no sense the Pentagon is training across the board
[39:41.720 --> 39:49.520]  for a Tea Party insurrection Associated Press Forbes Washington Times go read it
[39:49.520 --> 39:54.360]  we broke it all Army documents their main enemy you hear the Army call in all
[39:54.360 --> 39:58.280]  they do is trained to take on gun owners all they do is trained to break up
[39:58.280 --> 40:02.000]  families all they do is train to cordon cities all they do is train for
[40:02.000 --> 40:06.880]  treason and the great byproduct of that is the military is the most awake
[40:06.880 --> 40:11.800]  group now next who is it it's the cops because the cops most of them have
[40:11.800 --> 40:14.800]  military training they've actually they've been on the force five six years
[40:14.800 --> 40:18.240]  they know they're being lied to they know they're targeting innocent people
[40:18.240 --> 40:22.640]  they know they're told to not go after real criminals they know ladies and
[40:22.640 --> 40:25.640]  gentlemen and they see the training they're getting where the founding
[40:25.640 --> 40:31.000]  fathers and gun owners are badmouthed and they're not stupid compared to the
[40:31.000 --> 40:34.600]  general public there are a lot of corrupt thug cops a lot of bad people in
[40:34.600 --> 40:39.720]  there just like the general public but I'm telling you as I criticize bad police
[40:39.720 --> 40:44.080]  behavior on the separate end the police are the second most awake group out
[40:44.080 --> 40:51.160]  there the second most awake because they're not stupid and they know what's
[40:51.160 --> 40:54.240]  being covered up and they know all the stuff go on they know about the false
[40:54.240 --> 41:00.080]  flags they know about the drills at the marathon they know they know and
[41:00.080 --> 41:05.520]  everyone respects the truth deep down and everyone knows it didn't like we sell
[41:05.520 --> 41:10.240]  out to this and it makes America better it's not like we're selling out as a
[41:10.240 --> 41:14.680]  culture to something that's that's better as a culture we're selling out to
[41:14.680 --> 41:24.160]  poverty and tyranny and thug garbage and so this is it and and and I've told
[41:24.160 --> 41:28.040]  you everyone's on edge everybody's freaked out everybody in business is
[41:28.040 --> 41:32.520]  freaking out everybody every man woman the child I know says something's wrong
[41:32.520 --> 41:36.240]  everybody's on edge and it's not just the economic numbers it's not just the
[41:36.240 --> 41:42.440]  everyone in their gut knows the big change is about to happen a giant
[41:42.440 --> 41:50.560]  communist takeover of America is now accelerating it hasn't even started
[41:50.560 --> 41:54.680]  folks this is all just shutting up the full mass attack the full demonization
[41:54.680 --> 41:58.880]  the death squads the whole deal they are lining up and they and here's the
[41:58.880 --> 42:03.080]  thing they are disorganized they are being caught wide out in the open we've
[42:03.080 --> 42:07.880]  absolutely decloaked them for 20 years liberty movement for 50 years the
[42:07.880 --> 42:12.600]  liberty movement last 20 is accelerated patriots military mainly former
[42:12.600 --> 42:16.240]  military and police who were let in on the plans with the folks that were the
[42:16.240 --> 42:21.640]  whistle people like my shelf grab the ball historically and at an instinct of
[42:21.640 --> 42:26.560]  level to fight here in America as warriors for liberty and we're rag tag
[42:26.560 --> 42:31.360]  but we've developed in the field and have gotten stronger by fighting back and
[42:31.360 --> 42:38.840]  we're in a strong position and the enemy knows that so they're afraid to not
[42:38.840 --> 42:43.200]  launch the full hammered because they realize if they don't drop the hammer
[42:43.200 --> 42:47.960]  folks we're going to beat them I can see historically all the lines converging
[42:47.960 --> 42:52.120]  we're going to beat them this isn't Russia this isn't Germany this isn't
[42:52.120 --> 42:56.280]  China we may have been chemically attacked with the GMO and the bio and
[42:56.280 --> 42:59.840]  and the fluoride and all the rest up and our IQs are dropping they're hitting
[42:59.840 --> 43:04.880]  us hard but let me tell you folks the instincts are still there and there's a
[43:04.880 --> 43:08.000]  large portion of people that are resistant to this and actually makes us
[43:08.000 --> 43:13.520]  stronger and the and the the emergency transmission has gone out ladies and
[43:13.520 --> 43:17.960]  gentlemen that's all we are is an emergency beacon just like they like
[43:17.960 --> 43:21.920]  the watchtowers of old when the enemy was seen a far off landing and ships to
[43:21.920 --> 43:26.400]  get ready and we let the watchtowers a long time ago folks and people said oh
[43:26.400 --> 43:30.960]  that's a false alarm now we've seen countries overrun we've seen our
[43:30.960 --> 43:35.520]  culture overrun we've seen everything now we know and the battle is going on
[43:35.520 --> 43:40.520]  around us and the enemies have seized the media and they're up there saying we
[43:40.520 --> 43:43.960]  are your friends we are your friends lay down your arms go along with us don't
[43:43.960 --> 43:47.520]  listen to the enemy you're a terrorist if you speak out against this when they

[44:24.360 --> 44:31.160]  from within and you're seeing the ghost of the Republic like the Phoenix begin
[44:31.160 --> 44:35.680]  to try to materialize to reconstitute itself because humans live once and die
[44:35.680 --> 44:42.080]  but ideas can be reconstituted reanimated and not born again like a
[44:42.080 --> 44:46.560]  vampire a zombie born again ladies and gentlemen like Christ rising from the
[44:46.560 --> 44:50.920]  dead after three days are like Lazarus coming out of the tomb that's what this

[44:56.080 --> 45:02.800]  side the enemy fuels in fear of us they shake in fear of those of us that are
[45:02.800 --> 45:09.880]  not afraid and are committed and believe me they they would absolutely love to
[45:09.880 --> 45:13.000]  destroy me love to dig something up they've got investigative reporters

[45:41.800 --> 45:45.840]  you're on have you really looked in the mirror and decided forever for eternity
[45:45.840 --> 45:51.840]  you want to sign on to this better ask yourselves right now folks which sides
[45:51.840 --> 45:55.020]  you're on okay you better that's the most important decision your body means

[46:00.280 --> 46:04.400]  side of this equation which side of history you're gonna be on right now
[46:04.400 --> 46:09.480]  I've made my decision it's not a hard decision to make thank God I made this
[46:09.480 --> 46:20.240]  decision thank God I'm not part of the New World Order thank God better decide
[46:20.240 --> 46:25.400]  which side you're on now all the evidence points towards the drill we
[46:25.400 --> 46:27.840]  know there was a drill the week before it looks like a drill that day none of the
[46:27.840 --> 46:33.440]  story matches up a guy in a TSA uniform other shooters the same MO
[46:33.440 --> 46:38.480]  Boston bombings a hundred percent stage we always get more intel down the road I
[46:38.480 --> 46:43.640]  don't know regardless it's tailor-made they hyped this enough there's many ill
[46:43.640 --> 46:47.520]  people that will start attacking TSA lines now I've already told you never
[46:47.520 --> 46:52.480]  attack the TSA except verbally with the First Amendment and I'm gonna play a
[46:52.480 --> 46:57.240]  clip for maybe see news this is up on info wars.com and prison planet.com now
[46:57.240 --> 47:03.400]  listen they say there's a shadowy subculture that may be influencing
[47:03.400 --> 47:10.240]  people and they cut to me saying what kind of people want to go grope men
[47:10.240 --> 47:14.320]  women and children all day so see we're all being taught we're guilty until
[47:14.320 --> 47:19.480]  proven innocent they're rolling the TSA out at all proms all events kite
[47:19.480 --> 47:24.560]  festivals highways it's the end of our culture it's beyond Nazi Germany in the
[47:24.560 --> 47:28.320]  scope of not what Hitler did killing people when it comes to checkpoints
[47:28.320 --> 47:33.160]  they didn't do stuff at this level I mean this is an occupied country and they
[47:33.160 --> 47:37.440]  always I watched he spent and saw Governor Ridge say in 2002 you left to go
[47:37.440 --> 47:42.040]  to the TSA to get a job for they're gonna be have highway checkpoints Clinton
[47:42.040 --> 47:45.920]  put out a plan in 98 it's in my film police day 2000 I mean they always said
[47:45.920 --> 47:48.560]  they were gonna set up highway checkpoints and hardened points and
[47:48.560 --> 47:51.760]  train us to not have any rights and then start coming our houses and now the
[47:51.760 --> 47:56.040]  Houston police chief says no warrants to go in houses randomly I mean I I just
[47:56.040 --> 48:00.760]  read what they said they would do I mean I'm no military tactician here I
[48:00.760 --> 48:03.880]  studied history I know military takeovers when I see it and it's a slow
[48:03.880 --> 48:08.600]  motion thinking you can't recognize it and defeat it but now it's coming towards
[48:08.600 --> 48:12.880]  the crescendo the flashpoint you can put a piece of paper next to a fire and it
[48:12.880 --> 48:16.480]  browns and crinkles and doesn't and all of a sudden flashes into flame
[48:16.480 --> 48:21.360]  historically we're at the flashpoint but imagine didn't they say well you know
[48:21.360 --> 48:25.200]  even if you don't like the TSA and they're thankless job you don't have a
[48:25.200 --> 48:30.040]  right to kill people implying that those of us that criticized and had our free
[48:30.040 --> 48:35.640]  speech over oppression that's seen now our speech caused death so we're not
[48:35.640 --> 48:39.320]  allowed to have our speech let's go to that clip ABC News knows the last time
[48:39.320 --> 48:45.840]  Siazia traveled abroad was 2006 when he took a trip to Japan today Siazia's
[48:45.840 --> 48:50.040]  family issued their first public statement we like most Americans are
[48:50.040 --> 48:55.360]  shocked and numbed by the tragic events of last Friday but offered no clues what
[48:55.360 --> 49:01.640]  could have prompted his free the TSA has a thankless job enforcing procedures we
[49:01.640 --> 49:06.520]  all tolerate through gritted teeth a popular target no kidding who else
[49:06.520 --> 49:10.600]  wants a job grunting men women and children all day among some anti
[49:10.600 --> 49:14.640]  government activists the agency embodies a federal government that's too
[49:14.640 --> 49:19.640]  invasive corrupt and incompetent but today the US Attorney General took
[49:19.640 --> 49:25.160]  strong exception no feelings about the government can possibly justify them
[49:25.160 --> 49:31.040]  those kinds of actions in other words it's no excuse for murder David right
[49:31.040 --> 49:36.360]  ABC News LA when we come back I'll play the full clip with Diane Sawyer but but
[49:36.360 --> 49:42.480]  again this is the guy who stage fast and furious holder and I risked my life
[49:42.480 --> 49:44.720]  saying this but we've had the witnesses that were in the building we know the
[49:44.720 --> 49:48.120]  names of the FBI agents all of it okay I've interviewed the cops that were
[49:48.120 --> 49:52.600]  death-threaded in their office by the FBI like Don Browning the head of the K9
[49:52.600 --> 49:56.200]  unit it was there one minute after he said they told him you and your wife are
[49:56.200 --> 50:01.560]  dead if you don't shut up the the Attorney General was the deputy Attorney
[50:01.560 --> 50:05.480]  General and he bear minimum quarterback to the cover-up that came out in

[50:30.080 --> 50:37.520]  witnesses like Jane Graham in the HUD they would use the stairway to get some
[50:37.520 --> 50:42.200]  exercise going to the ninth floor and she was struck by how handsome the federal

[01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:24.600]  now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones show about a month ago the TSA that's
[01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:29.080]  rolling out as a national police force a gun force to shout orders at the
[01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:32.320]  American people training everybody that we're suspects getting ready to do
[01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:36.880]  process in the name of fighting al-qaeda that the globalists run publicly they
[01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:39.800]  come out and they say if you even laugh at us we're gonna arrest you even
[01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:44.960]  there's no statutes in that area it's total fraud this is the intimidation and
[01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:48.000]  let's shut down the Tea Party let's have the IRS audit them arrest them
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:51.680]  whatever and then that the White House gets caught giving the orders it doesn't
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:55.520]  get in trouble they're a thousand times beyond Nixon when it comes to the spying
[01:00:55.520 --> 01:01:02.120]  and then we say we don't like TSA they're universally unpopular and now
[01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:05.480]  they're rolling out on the streets and somebody reportedly goes and shoots some
[01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:10.840]  people and I said watch they're gonna blame this on us and then indeed they
[01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:16.560]  did blame it on us and said shadowy subculture is influencing the shooter
[01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:20.440]  because someone claims they put a note in his bag kind of like the two passports
[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:24.800]  that were found on the ground on 9-11 of the hijackers one of them
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:29.600]  undamaged that fell down out of the man's jacket out of the burning fireball
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:34.240]  into the hundreds of millions pieces of paper and feet of dust and was found by
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:41.120]  by the FBI I mean that'd be like cops if I was on national TV live at the
[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:48.040]  Super Bowl if cops walked up shot me in the head and then put a gun in my hand
[01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:56.000]  on TV I mean it's just plain view talking to you like you are a total and
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:05.720]  complete moron then at the airport Mohammed Atta's bag is the one that
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:09.840]  doesn't make it on with all of his admissions on it I mean just goes on and
[01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:13.680]  on and then Mohammed Atta of course ABC news was forced to report back at the
[01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:20.640]  time and first was the San Jose Mercury news then in the ABC news AP picked it
[01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:23.080]  up they head of the defense language school and I talked to him he wouldn't
[01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:25.360]  come on the show he's being threatened then he got they started a court
[01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:28.880]  martial till he signed national security agreements Mohammed Atta and three
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:33.160]  others were trained in his classes in national security they were being
[01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:39.000]  prepared to be CIA officers and all he said was those men on TV they are they
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:43.240]  work for the US government that something happened this is a setup and
[01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:46.440]  they declared national security on him and again the court martial they didn't
[01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:52.000]  deny it I don't know what happened on 9-11 folks I just know that these people
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.560]  staged stuff and they sure used it to take our rights and now they flipped it
[01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:59.760]  from al-Qaeda the whole time they would only say it was for al-Qaeda on the
[01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:04.200]  surface it was always about the American people it's always been directed
[01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:09.640]  and pointed at us to absolutely incinerate all of our rights and
[01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:14.560]  destroy our republic and then the other news I haven't gotten to Watson goes into
[01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:21.960]  the Fed biz website where they continue to spend 19 million 88 million 25
[01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:27.080]  million depends on the state to hire these armed security guards with top
[01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:31.440]  secret security clearances folks most people in a military base even in
[01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:36.880]  secure areas only have secret top secrets like nuclear designs and stuff I
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:42.720]  mean it's like super top secrets just incredibly secret and they have above
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:47.040]  top secret DHS to hired top secret domestic security force that's a quote
[01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:50.640]  is the Department of Homeland Security building a mercenary unit that there's
[01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:56.280]  no doubt about it they're hiring mercenaries XC and others who with heavy
[01:03:56.280 --> 01:04:01.560]  combat experience these are offensive units and you better believe it they're
[01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:08.720]  not garden Benghazi they're gearing up with beyond major embassy level security
[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:14.040]  for the threat fusion centers to run the war against the American people and that
[01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:17.640]  means they're prepared to have military units obviously they're going to be
[01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:24.240]  ordered at different pre-cash facilities that's why they've got the drones is to
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:29.640]  send them in against any army or marine units that don't go along with the
[01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:34.920]  takeover the drones will be employed I mean this is a this is a plan folks this
[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:42.800]  is so evil this is a total military takeover in the back on the front is an
[01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:46.600]  economic meltdown with the system poses as the savior while shutting everything
[01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:49.720]  down I just can't believe I'm on here talking about this I can't believe ABC
[01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:53.640]  news is coming out saying I'm connected to the killing of that TSA person I'm
[01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:57.120]  I'm involved in the Boston bombing you've heard of all folks I mean why is
[01:04:57.120 --> 01:05:00.280]  that because we know what we're talking about
[01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:06.120]  strategic relocation is a systematic way to think strategically in the future of

[01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:23.400]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now we
[01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:27.800]  head out west to Los Angeles and the news on the airport shooter tonight there
[01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:31.920]  are urgent calls for more airport security at LAX and airports across the
[01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:37.280]  country as investigators are studying a shadowy subculture which may have
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:42.280]  encouraged a disturbed young man ABC's David Wright with the very latest of the
[01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:50.400]  story. FBI is now fairly convinced Paul Siancia was targeting TSA agents what
[01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:55.960]  they don't know is why. We have to have a fuller understanding of the person who we
[01:08:55.960 --> 01:09:00.800]  now have because they don't understand what his motives might have been.
[01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:05.720]  Trouble is they can't even ask him. Siancia is still unconscious at UCLA medical
[01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:10.100]  center with a gunshot wound to the head. Today the FBI called through his
[01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:14.840]  apartment for clues and called through his travel records to see if he ever had
[01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:20.080]  a run-in with airport security. ABC News knows the last time Siancia traveled
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:26.600]  abroad was 2006 when he took a trip to Japan. Today Siancia's family issued their
[01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:31.200]  first public statement. We like most Americans are shocked and numbed by the
[01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:35.920]  tragic events of last Friday but offered no clues what could have prompted his
[01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:42.040]  spree. The TSA has a thankless job enforcing procedures we all tolerate
[01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:47.520]  for gritted teeth a popular target. No kidding who else wants a job grunting
[01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:51.840]  men women and children all day. Among some anti-government activists the agency
[01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:57.400]  embodies a federal government that's too invasive corrupt and incompetent but
[01:09:57.400 --> 01:10:02.000]  today the US Attorney General took strong exception. No feelings about the
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:07.000]  government can possibly justify them those kinds of actions. In other words
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:15.760]  it's no excuse for murder. David Wright ABC News LAX. So there you go ladies and
[01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:21.960]  gentlemen now if you criticize having your genitals grow up being put in a
[01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:25.240]  microwave having them scan your naked body they've been caught lying about all
[01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:29.960]  of that in their denials they've been caught with just an army of criminals
[01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:35.280]  at the TSA robbing people harassing people I personally have been harassed at
[01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:41.040]  LAX. I've told that story many times of just politely going through taking my
[01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:46.680]  shoes off and then to TSA people saying stinky feet look at Mr. Stinky feet and
[01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:49.600]  then going oh you don't like being called stinky feet and I was I didn't get
[01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:54.000]  really mad I was like what's what are you five years old you're pathetic you
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:57.520]  don't like a gear supervisor the whole point was I just taken a shower and my
[01:10:57.520 --> 01:11:02.280]  feet didn't stink they were just messing with me I mean who wants a job where
[01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:08.200]  they get to mess with people all day but total losers and I know some TSA people
[01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:11.800]  are just doing it for the money I've run into them on the street they've come to
[01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:16.160]  my events I get that who's really to blame is Congress and the American
[01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:20.840]  people allowing a domestic takeover army like this to be set up and now
[01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:25.600]  they're moving to arm them as we predicted and with the backdrop of
[01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:36.640]  billions of rounds of ammo with the backdrop taking place out there of the
[01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:41.200]  no hesitation paper targets where they train to shoot and kill small children
[01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:47.600]  women old men homeland security the company said requested two million
[01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:53.200]  dollars worth of a targets of of Americans in in shower caps and things
[01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:57.440]  to be shot and you've got all the open drilling all their own manuals war with
[01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:02.040]  the Tea Party we have radical folks that quote Mao Zedong filling up the
[01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:05.600]  White House we have an attorney general that says we want to brainwash the
[01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:10.040]  public against the Second Amendment who staged fast and furious that killed
[01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:15.560]  thousands of Mexico at least hundreds in the United States running around
[01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:21.680]  obviously now saying well Jones you know Jones doesn't like the TSA other
[01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:25.240]  anti-government doesn't like them but it doesn't mean you get to kill people why
[01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:28.720]  didn't you play all the clips where I said do not offensively go out and shoot
[01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:34.520]  cops or shoot TSA people or any of them they are not the enemy it is the
[01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:39.800]  globalist that have occupied this country the only time you shoot is if they
[01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:43.000]  start some big roundup which they're pushing for and they try to come take
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:47.440]  you illegally and unlawfully to one of their little Politico systems one of
[01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:52.680]  their little commas are command bases which they publicly are training for in
[01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:58.520]  the official Army manuals type in Army manual reeducation camp 2010 by
[01:12:58.520 --> 01:13:02.800]  directive by the Secretary of Defense by directive of the president over a
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:06.320]  hundred pages about a process of Social Security numbers and put
[01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:15.560]  political radicals tea party people in labor camps civilian inmate labor camps
[01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:22.880]  civilian inmate labor camps there it is FM 3-39 dot 40 internment resettlement
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:26.240]  operations how to process your Social Security numbers how to take your
[01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:32.400]  guns how to break your family up they're gonna turn society off let all the
[01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:36.880]  welfare people right run around folks will beg the military to come in then
[01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:41.440]  they'll start staging terror attacks claiming the tea party is shooting and
[01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:45.760]  killing US military personnel trying to maintain order if I was a globalist is
[01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:49.080]  how I would do it and then I see all their preparation this is how they'll do
[01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:54.720]  it they will attack US military forces they will kill police and they will do
[01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:59.120]  it an obvious and horrible way they'll have a manual Goldstein 1984 type
[01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:03.120]  character who'll be wearing a mask and they'll have like an aid to camp
[01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:06.360]  standing right beside him I caught him before that's how I was able to say
[01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:13.000]  Atari was going to be set up out of over a thousand known militias I could
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:16.640]  see the scripting but three months before I saw this video I played it I
[01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:23.760]  said that is fed produced because it's done at a cartoon level again how do I
[01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:27.960]  know when football season is coming up you see the dun-dun-dun-dun NFL ads I
[01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:35.040]  mean it's it's it's prescripted folks when you're awake it's all right there so
[01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:37.320]  in the last month I've been saying they're gonna stage mass shootings they're
[01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:40.200]  gonna stage mass shootings probably at the TSA probably an airport they're
[01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:43.720]  gonna move security out to the end of the airport then it's gonna be down the
[01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:50.080]  road from the airport I know them I know how they operate it's already
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:55.480]  happening and now the TSA is gonna be all militant after they lost their
[01:14:55.480 --> 01:15:02.280]  comrade and even meaner the public and when people make jokes now I I predict
[01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:06.000]  they're gonna start beating up travelers calling in the cops and I predict
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.880]  it's already happened before in Phoenix other areas they are going to start
[01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:15.560]  killing under they're gonna put bullies in and say do whatever you want and
[01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:19.320]  they're gonna end up beating and killing citizens in airports they've already
[01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:22.640]  done it one with a handcuffs behind her back that a panic attack they they
[01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:27.480]  broke her neck they've done it in Canada a bunch too now we're going into a
[01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:30.400]  dangerous phase we're going to the airport is incredibly more dangerous
[01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:33.560]  than it was because you're gonna be the terrorist they told now the Tea Party
[01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:36.120]  terrorists the gun owning terrorists the folks that want the fourth amendment
[01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:39.400]  they're coming in and I predict they're gonna harass people flying with guns
[01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:43.040]  legally you know where you check them with the ammo and stuff I predict now
[01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:48.520]  and again that's meant to then make people really hate the TSA and they may
[01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:53.440]  even be able to generate real attacks on the TSA
[01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:57.520]  there be folks it was declassified partially how they had the Shiite Sunnis
[01:15:57.520 --> 01:16:01.520]  all over the Middle East the last 60 years kill each other including in Iraq
[01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:04.920]  Ray McGovern came on talk about the bombing of the Golden Mosque what was
[01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:08.800]  that to be blamed on the Sunnis to get the Sunnis and Shiites killing each other
[01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:14.520]  just like they brought in Sunnis to start killing Shiites in Syria I mean
[01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:18.760]  they're experts the globalists are experts they're getting black and white to
[01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:22.920]  kill each other Catholic Protestant to hate each other gay straight to hate
[01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:28.120]  each other Hispanic white to hate each other when we're all under attack and
[01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:34.240]  I'm here saying unity come together so they ADL so the probably Law Center CNN
[01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:39.200]  MSNBC every week now Alex Jones is racist they'll just randomly in a show
[01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:44.760]  like Alex Jones the racist and folks I could win the lawsuits but it's a cost
[01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:50.240]  benefit analysis I already know how dark it is I already know how deep ended
[01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:56.480]  midnight we are seconds from midnight from the chimes folks all hell breaks
[01:16:56.480 --> 01:17:02.120]  loose that they've now been given authorization to say things about myself
[01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:06.840]  and many others that that in the they wouldn't say five years ago folks they
[01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:19.080]  have been given full authorization to do anything ahead of my assassination and
[01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:23.280]  I'm not like a moth to flame that wants that to happen but if they do that it's
[01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:27.440]  in God's hands I'm not even worried about it the I've I would have lived a
[01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:31.880]  pure good life and by pure I mean pure of heart certainly not pure of my flesh
[01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:36.560]  and I don't think that's in the cards and I may just do that because they're
[01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:39.560]  getting so arrogant and to send a message but I think it'll come once the
[01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:42.760]  purge starts and we're trying to stop that right now I don't want the Civil
[01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:47.720]  War to start they got provocateurs all over ready to start this folks more
[01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:52.520]  likely they'll pull me over throw a bag of cocaine on me or something or
[01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:57.000]  claim I did something with a cop shoot me in the back of the head hit squads in
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:00.400]  most major cities I haven't confirmed Austin has one I know Dallas has a
[01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:04.120]  Department of Defense run hit squad they have a CIA run hit squad and we've
[01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:06.800]  confirmed through our sources you know you've seen when they pull over other
[01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:12.040]  CIA people cops get them out cops put a gun on chopper blow the guys head off at
[01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:15.760]  point blank and then there's no investigation it's a national security
[01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:21.320]  they're just executing people all over the place and I know that because I've
[01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:25.720]  had family people act like this is like me just crediting myself no no that's
[01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:33.520]  how widespread this is I've had family in the army sheep dipped into CIA who
[01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:37.880]  people say you never get out that's another big lie folks people most people
[01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:43.360]  get out most people won't do because it just gets worse and worse and worse and
[01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:50.880]  worse you know killing people killing people in America in the drug trade and
[01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:59.600]  this was in the 80s at last word they've got 10,000 plus sheep dipped army
[01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:03.620]  officers well infregard came out in the news about six seven years ago where they
[01:19:03.620 --> 01:19:09.920]  train executives for orders and license to kill their employees during a takeover
[01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:14.800]  so I mean look they already tried three years ago to recruit my dad and every
[01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:17.800]  dentist he knew he was talking other dentists other offices they go no
[01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:21.760]  Homeland Security came here and offered us money and my dad's like well what's
[01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:27.920]  the mission and they said they said well we want you to come to these meetings
[01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:30.320]  but basically want you to watch your patients and report to us what they're
[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:34.280]  saying politically and he and he was like is this because of who my son is and
[01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:39.520]  the Homeland Security guy literally didn't even know who my dad's son was
[01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:42.720]  and my dad thought it was a setup or something so I said talk to their dentist
[01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:46.280]  turned out they were all getting visits including at their home and most of them
[01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:49.920]  wet themselves with glee that they were now it was everybody knows that Homeland

[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:54.440]  kill me with his guest it is not fun over the years to have witnessed all
[01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:58.640]  of the incredible evil the globalist carry out and they'd love to be able to
[01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:02.000]  do here what they've done in third-world countries but they've got to sell us on
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:09.320]  it first and we're saying we are not buying what they're selling and they
[01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:12.720]  want to change the subject to some speech Rand Paul gave that has a quote
[01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:17.400]  that he didn't attribute right oh that's a huge sin to divert us from Benghazi
[01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:23.360]  and fast and furious and IRS gate and NSA gate and the other 15 gates and all
[01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:27.320]  the abject corruption and the federal government running the school lunch
[01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:31.240]  program telling parents they can't pack lunches and people being arrested for
[01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:37.200]  water guns I mean this is out of control this government's gone mad dog it's
[01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:41.000]  stolen tens of trillions it knows it's gonna go to prison like a bunch of
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:47.680]  birdie made-offs and they want to bring in tyranny as a rearguard action and I
[01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:52.960]  guess I'm the person weird enough to not have sold out to all this but when
[01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:57.880]  everybody sells out the whole society implodes and man they're getting riot
[01:25:57.880 --> 01:26:02.760]  trips ready merc groups ready with license to kill tops secret security
[01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:07.360]  clearances they've got ads everywhere recruiting CIA patsies all these dumb
[01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:12.440]  college kids I mean they are building up a full takeover system and it is going
[01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:16.960]  to be hellish and we don't want to go there and they're gonna get the war
[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:22.800]  going with a bunch of stage garbage and you see who up front they say is behind
[01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:27.800]  all these terrorist attacks yours truly I've got the clips coming up we're
[01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:31.360]  gathering them I'm behind the Boston bombing I'm behind the racism I'm
[01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:34.320]  behind three cops but and getting killed in Pittsburgh turns out Richard
[01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:39.520]  Poplowski hated me was on my website every day attacking me because I'm not
[01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:43.520]  racist and all this stuff they went in his computer he shot three cops because
[01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:46.880]  he was drunk and his mother was throwing him out of the house and within two
[01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:52.960]  hours of him being in custody Southern Probably Law Center had a newspaper
[01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:58.400]  article out that I forced a retraction on saying he did it for Alex Jones and
[01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:03.320]  they do this over and over again every time out of 315 million people every
[01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:07.920]  year or so some former Marine or some libertarian does something wrong when
[01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:11.040]  libertarians are probably the biggest political group in the country now major
[01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:14.400]  polls have like 63% of Americans saying they're libertarian now not
[01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:19.020]  Republican or Democrat that is libertarian ideas anytime a libertarian
[01:27:19.020 --> 01:27:24.120]  does anything when they're drunk because he had two pit bulls and his mother said
[01:27:24.120 --> 01:27:28.280]  move out and he wouldn't he was drunk and the cops come and he like a cowardly
[01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:32.640]  piece of trash shoots them and kills them and I get blamed and I told that
[01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:36.880]  Pennsylvania paper and I guess it works I need just to start suing people and I
[01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:41.480]  told five other outfits a raw story having to post you name it I said that's
[01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:47.080]  it I'm suing you we found his handle you knew he hated me on all the Nazi
[01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:50.320]  websites and on my own website they found his handle in the comments I'm
[01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:55.720]  going to sue you because you're trying to manipulate police to set me up or
[01:27:55.720 --> 01:28:01.960]  something I'm not stupid and notice they're a little slicker now where they
[01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:05.880]  they have a clip I'm gonna come back into Obamacare on the other nose it's just
[01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:11.760]  that ladies and gentlemen can you imagine I need your prayers that I be given

[01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:34.880]  that it is it is I don't think there's very many other people alive who've

[01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:48.280]  congressman sued to try to get that information I mean this is this is what's
[01:36:48.280 --> 01:36:51.760]  going on and I told you I told you they're gonna roll it on the streets
[01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:56.520]  they're gonna be at the dog shows they're gonna be at the proms I can't go to
[01:36:56.520 --> 01:37:00.360]  the kite festival now they're starting to search bags it's all pure bull if a
[01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:03.840]  real terrorist would walk up to the checkpoint and blow that up that's the
[01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:08.160]  best area to blow somebody up that's where the real Taliban goes to blow
[01:37:08.160 --> 01:37:12.240]  people up there's no way to be safe there's no way to stop somebody that
[01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:15.280]  wants to kill people unless you have a total prison you're living in and then
[01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:21.840]  that's always a hundred times worse so my point is is there's just stacks of it
[01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:29.960]  and that's why info wars.com and what we do is so important because we are the
[01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:37.400]  tip of the spear and we know about the takeover. I mean look at this headline
[01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:42.400]  police doctors force man to undergo humiliating
[01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:50.240]  enemas anal exams and x-rays
[01:37:54.200 --> 01:37:59.680]  look at that headline feds move to pin LAX shooting on patriots well they move
[01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:07.560]  to pin it on me DHS to hire top-secret domestic security force ABC news
[01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:13.720]  implicates Alex Jones and LAX shooting has read it banned all alternative
[01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:18.720]  media drudge report info wars on political blacklist period Obama denies
[01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:23.760]  you can keep it videotape promises we're gonna get to that in a minute 900,000
[01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:27.400]  to lose health insurance in California on top of 300,000 already did as
[01:38:27.400 --> 01:38:33.280]  Obamacare disaster spirals and spreads Island of debris the size of Texas
[01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:37.560]  from 2011 Japanese tsunami is headed straight for the US it's finally
[01:38:37.560 --> 01:38:42.880]  about to get here I mean this is just a biblical disaster that's on prison
[01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:48.680]  planet.com and info wars.com why do you think they come after me and say I'm
[01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:52.840]  deeply racist I'm behind the boss in bombing I'm making people shoot TSA
[01:38:52.840 --> 01:38:56.240]  agents if this guy really went and shot these people and it wasn't some drill
[01:38:56.240 --> 01:39:01.200]  and a setup with a patsy which is they've done before and they have the
[01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:04.160]  motive and it's the same crew that did Oklahoma City and they're running this
[01:39:04.160 --> 01:39:12.400]  that quote want to brainwash us against liberty then there is there's just no
[01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:15.200]  telling but the preponderance of historical evidence points towards this
[01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:19.680]  power structure but if this guy really was a listener then he wasn't listening
[01:39:19.680 --> 01:39:25.080]  very closely because I say every day and get criticized by the provocateurs do
[01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:31.520]  not offensively go out and shoot anybody politically try to wake people up the
[01:39:31.520 --> 01:39:36.840]  Bill of Rights and Constitution wake up police and military and others and TSA
[01:39:36.840 --> 01:39:41.000]  go to the airports hand out flyers engage in the First Amendment we've had
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:45.560]  folks doing that successfully the police have been supporting it that's how we
[01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:49.840]  stop a civil war the globalist just like they divided black against white and
[01:39:49.840 --> 01:39:53.680]  all that would trade on Martin and all the stuff and George Zimmerman they want
[01:39:53.680 --> 01:39:59.760]  us now all against each other I feel sorry for the TSA agents and the cancer
[01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:03.720]  clusters they've been covering up for eight years with the new high-powered
[01:40:03.720 --> 01:40:08.560]  x-rays not just the body scanners those it's a death sentence working around
[01:40:08.560 --> 01:40:14.240]  that and just like the atomic soldiers and the troops with the DU and all the
[01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:18.320]  rest of it it's all coming out now just like the poison dust on 9-11 and they
[01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:21.840]  knew they had an internal memo that day saying shut it all down for a month it's
[01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:25.400]  got to be cleaned up it's deadly poison and they said open the schools send in
[01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:30.120]  the police send in the firefighters no breathers needed because it's safe as
[01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:33.480]  they said you got to have breathers they would have had to admit it was toxic and
[01:40:33.480 --> 01:40:36.400]  not open all the businesses
[01:40:39.680 --> 01:40:47.240]  so this is the reality and they try to act like they care about this one TSA
[01:40:47.240 --> 01:40:51.000]  agent that died and and the Attorney General the Attorney Criminal gets up
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:55.200]  there and acts like he's all upset when when this is a guy ladies and gentlemen
[01:40:55.200 --> 01:40:58.440]  when you read the stuff that came out in the federal court at the Salt Lake
[01:40:58.440 --> 01:41:01.600]  City papers have reported on with a lawsuit up there over the last five
[01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:06.160]  years the group of lawsuits by the lawyer brother of a guy they tortured to death
[01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:09.960]  thinking he was one of their operatives he looked just like one of their
[01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:16.400]  operatives but the whole point is is that it came out in court who really ran
[01:41:16.400 --> 01:41:22.000]  Oklahoma City and it's very scary when you realize that to the Attorney
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:26.000]  General blowing up that daycare center so that they could blame dead kids on
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:30.160]  patriots and have the image of the bloody baby in the fireman's arms that's
[01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:33.280]  just collateral damage that's nothing to them that these are them it's like Obama
[01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:36.400]  bragging to his aides I'm really good at killing people they'll bomb a whole
[01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:40.800]  wedding party and kill 200 plus people 50 something of them children and say
[01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:45.440]  big deal collateral damage make me a hamburger let's go shoot some hoops I'm
[01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:49.520]  really good at killing people high five I'm really manly having robot drones
[01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:56.280]  but oh my gosh one TSA person roasting and radiation every day roasting in in
[01:41:56.280 --> 01:42:05.720]  in the X-rays oh my goodness what are we gonna do they're so sad right now
[01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:15.760]  Madeline Albright was asked in 1996 hey the Iraq war has killed 500,000
[01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:23.120]  children from starvation and she didn't even deny that they caught up the food
[01:42:23.120 --> 01:42:27.320]  the medical care everything she said yeah that's a good price to pay and I've
[01:42:27.320 --> 01:42:32.760]  had ABC Nightly News here and Esquire and I tell them that and ABC News looked
[01:42:32.760 --> 01:42:36.800]  me and said she never said that and I went and played the clip and he and the
[01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:43.440]  ABC Nightly News anchor goes she didn't mean that now Esquire guy didn't believe
[01:42:43.440 --> 01:42:46.880]  me went and found it and said oh my gosh she let her apologize and said she
[01:42:46.880 --> 01:42:51.680]  shouldn't have said that she said that on democracy now good for Madeline
[01:42:51.680 --> 01:42:56.640]  Albright please we have heard that a half a million children have died I mean
[01:42:56.640 --> 01:43:03.920]  that's more children than died when we're in Hiroshima and and you know is the
[01:43:03.920 --> 01:43:09.560]  price worth it I think this is a very hard choice that the price we think the
[01:43:09.560 --> 01:43:13.560]  price is worth it we think the price is worth all right and that's actually her
[01:43:13.560 --> 01:43:17.080]  she said it twice she said it on NBC and she also said it that's the shorter
[01:43:17.080 --> 01:43:23.440]  clip from from 60 minutes and then she got asked about it again like a year
[01:43:23.440 --> 01:43:28.480]  later on NBC of Memory Service she said for stability in the Gulf is the full
[01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:34.960]  quote so so 500,000 children spilt milk don't cry about it water under the
[01:43:34.960 --> 01:43:41.920]  bridge nothing and you think the globalists won't run you over let's go
[01:43:41.920 --> 01:43:46.120]  to info wars.com we have a daily caller story up there at info wars.com it's
[01:43:46.120 --> 01:43:53.360]  also up on drudge report.com and it I noticed the video wasn't there this
[01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:56.600]  morning of the daily caller article so I'm gonna have the video the guys
[01:43:56.600 --> 01:44:00.400]  actually were able to find it I'm gonna have us add that to our version because
[01:44:00.400 --> 01:44:03.320]  I saw the transcript from his meeting I'm like well then where is it so the
[01:44:03.320 --> 01:44:05.720]  whole team searched and searched and searched oh I guess they already did it
[01:44:05.720 --> 01:44:09.320]  and they well they found the one where they said you can keep your plan we're
[01:44:09.320 --> 01:44:15.720]  gonna add the one to the caller I'm sure I want to add what we add as well the
[01:44:15.720 --> 01:44:20.280]  clip that we were able to dig up from last night where he did indeed say to a
[01:44:20.280 --> 01:44:25.960]  group of Democrats and I have the full quotes right here we're only able to
[01:44:25.960 --> 01:44:31.200]  find part of it where he said that I never said that you wouldn't be kicked
[01:44:31.200 --> 01:44:34.880]  off your insurance plan and then we have the clip of course where he says it 29
[01:44:34.880 --> 01:44:38.120]  times and the interest of time I can't play them all I'll play a few minutes of
[01:44:38.120 --> 01:44:43.320]  them no state of the unions and things but let's go ahead and go to he never
[01:44:43.320 --> 01:44:48.720]  said that he never said that he never said you could keep your plan here it
[01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:54.240]  is before the Affordable Care Act came in the law and you really liked that
[01:44:54.240 --> 01:45:02.120]  plan what we said was you could keep it if it hasn't changed since the laws
[01:45:02.120 --> 01:45:07.720]  passed these old plans to be downgraded or or sold to new and rollies once the
[01:45:07.720 --> 01:45:11.280]  law had already passed then we would have broken an even more important
[01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:16.240]  promise making sure that Americans gain access to health care that doesn't
[01:45:16.240 --> 01:45:22.200]  leave them one illness away from financial ruin so the bottom line is is
[01:45:22.200 --> 01:45:29.480]  that we are making the insurance market better for everybody and that's the
[01:45:29.480 --> 01:45:34.920]  right thing to do bottom line period right thing to do everybody's like yeah
[01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:40.520]  all right yeah I'm in the room with you I feel important now while he sits there
[01:45:40.520 --> 01:45:43.960]  lying to you anybody could go read the bill anybody could read the writers we
[01:45:43.960 --> 01:45:47.240]  know exactly what was going to do I'm really shocked they're implementing at
[01:45:47.240 --> 01:45:51.280]  this hardcore it's one thing to know it and have it on paper something to see
[01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:56.360]  it entirely it was one thing to eat some sausage nothing to see it being made
[01:45:56.360 --> 01:46:06.000]  as they say and and you know we are the sausage being gobbled up here it's just
[01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:10.760]  it's just it's just it he makes Bill Clinton look like the most honest man in
[01:46:10.760 --> 01:46:17.560]  history I mean these lies are such mega juicy whoppers and even establishment
[01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:21.440]  media is going whoa fact here's some of the headlines I've got them right here
[01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:28.600]  Obama care speech he never gave that's one headline by Rich Lowry National
[01:46:28.600 --> 01:46:33.240]  Journal lying about lies why credibility matters to Obama the presence
[01:46:33.240 --> 01:46:38.040]  trying to reinvent the history of you can keep it promises on health care
[01:46:38.040 --> 01:46:43.880]  affordable care act could be further hamstrung by shortage of doctors that's
[01:46:43.880 --> 01:46:49.080]  some of the headlines here's the big news that before we go to his original
[01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:53.920]  clips saying you can keep it period I promise firm pledge firm pledge no taxes
[01:46:53.920 --> 01:46:58.800]  on folks more than 200,000 250,000 dollars a year and then people make them
[01:46:58.800 --> 01:47:02.360]  30,000 got their taxes raised I mean no I will hire no lobbyist hire more lobbyist
[01:47:02.360 --> 01:47:06.200]  anybody else I will cut the deficit in half more than doubled it I will I will
[01:47:06.200 --> 01:47:10.440]  just on and on and on and on and on and on I will not come after your second
[01:47:10.440 --> 01:47:13.560]  amendment not your handguns not your shotguns not your rivals none of it I'm
[01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:19.040]  a firm believer firm pledge 180 degrees and then his minions cannot admit
[01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:23.400]  they've been conned but here's the big story because I've seen it in the news
[01:47:23.400 --> 01:47:27.840]  I've read it I'm getting the calls on it it's all over the Huffington Posts
[01:47:27.840 --> 01:47:31.480]  everywhere but none of the libertarian or patriot media has picked up on it
[01:47:31.480 --> 01:47:37.160]  other than drudge picking up that story two days ago with a manuals brother one
[01:47:37.160 --> 01:47:40.320]  of the main architects is Eekiel saying of course we're gonna wreck the
[01:47:40.320 --> 01:47:45.760]  healthcare and get rid of the single you know market and folks being able to
[01:47:45.760 --> 01:47:49.320]  choose the insurance companies know that well yeah cuz they want to be able to
[01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:54.640]  control all that profit and not let you have a choice so they're admitting the
[01:47:54.640 --> 01:47:58.680]  clowered and pivot strategy here now but we've got all the Democrats now like
[01:47:58.680 --> 01:48:05.120]  cult members going oh a genius plan I heard of me yesterday on 590 on the
[01:48:05.120 --> 01:48:09.480]  nighttime show when I was driving going out to get something before I came back
[01:48:09.480 --> 01:48:13.120]  to the office and they were Democrats calling on Obama's really smart he just
[01:48:13.120 --> 01:48:15.800]  wants socialism to give us something free and this is gonna wreck that whole
[01:48:15.800 --> 01:48:19.640]  bad system it's government involvement with the corporations that wrecked the
[01:48:19.640 --> 01:48:25.080]  best healthcare system in the world now it's gonna get 10 times worse let's go
[01:48:25.080 --> 01:48:27.760]  out to break though with just a short snippet because there's too many of these
[01:48:27.760 --> 01:48:31.200]  it's like an hour of these okay an hour of them here's a few minutes of him
[01:48:31.200 --> 01:48:35.280]  saying you can keep your health care plan but now he said he never said that
[01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:40.760]  so it's true or you're racist here it is we will keep this promise oh to the
[01:48:40.760 --> 01:48:45.360]  American people that's 2009 if you like your doctor you will be able to keep your
[01:48:45.360 --> 01:48:50.680]  doctor period if you like your health care plan you'll be able to keep your
[01:48:50.680 --> 01:49:06.680]  health care plan period no matter what you've heard if you like your doctor or
[01:49:06.680 --> 01:49:11.760]  health care plan you can keep it if you like your doctor you can keep your
[01:49:11.760 --> 01:49:17.160]  doctor if you like your private health insurance plan you can keep three years
[01:49:17.160 --> 01:49:22.520]  ago folks period if you are here on the hundreds of millions of Americans who
[01:49:22.520 --> 01:49:25.680]  already have health insurance through your job welcome to trendies and say
[01:49:25.680 --> 01:49:31.480]  we're medic give me your wallet they would just go or the VA nothing in this
[01:49:31.480 --> 01:49:35.760]  plan will require you or your employer to change the coverage of the doctor you
[01:49:35.760 --> 01:49:38.320]  have we're gonna put old
[01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:51.800]  let me repeat this he says al-qaeda bases on the moon our approach would
[01:49:51.800 --> 01:49:55.640]  preserve the right of Americans think there's no insurance to keep their
[01:49:55.640 --> 01:50:00.760]  doctor and their plan because the governor thinks there's moon bases so
[01:50:00.760 --> 01:50:04.240]  there you go that's just a short sniff but there are longer videos on YouTube
[01:50:04.240 --> 01:50:09.920]  that are literally an hour long so that the speeches are in context where you
[01:50:09.920 --> 01:50:15.800]  know there's like minute clips there's one that has him saying it 29 times and
[01:50:15.800 --> 01:50:19.480]  it's like 40 minutes long and then there's another one I saw that's over an
[01:50:19.480 --> 01:50:24.400]  hour long that found even more of them and I can't even watch at all I just
[01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:28.800]  skipped to the clip checking it I mean this is insane and then I'm the bad guy
[01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:33.920]  I'm behind the Boston bombing really no proof I'm behind the TSA shooting really
[01:50:33.920 --> 01:50:38.600]  because I play clips of you lying I mean I'm bad that's what the Pentagon said

[01:54:22.960 --> 01:54:27.960]  churches now to pay for abortions this is Obamacare it's all happening and all
[01:54:27.960 --> 01:54:32.480]  over Austin the Southern Poverty Law Center is running around raising money
[01:54:32.480 --> 01:54:40.040]  where I live and Chris Jordan ran into them at the Austin Film Festival
[01:54:40.040 --> 01:54:45.080]  Austin Film Society deal trying to get some petition to restrict free speech
[01:54:45.080 --> 01:54:49.000]  in the name of fighting the KKK and then Kellan McBreen who works in the
[01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:52.080]  Shipment Department also does some proofreading a Darren McBreen son works
[01:54:52.080 --> 01:54:56.160]  here great guy just out of high school and has more brains than the average you
[01:54:56.160 --> 01:55:00.760]  know 60 year old trendy he ran into them this weekend was telling me about it and
[01:55:00.760 --> 01:55:04.800]  and the way you just in the coffee room were repeating what you said to them
[01:55:04.800 --> 01:55:09.640]  Kellan just just repeat exactly what you told me about these literal
[01:55:09.640 --> 01:55:13.760]  authoritarians running around and what you said to them and what they said yeah
[01:55:13.760 --> 01:55:17.720]  I mean my girlfriend were there and we went and confronted them basically asked
[01:55:17.720 --> 01:55:20.560]  what they were doing there you're at the farmers the farmers you're at the
[01:55:20.560 --> 01:55:24.000]  terrorist market get close to your mic bro sure we're at the terrorist market on
[01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:27.600]  the east side you know so where the trendies like to hang so of course they
[01:55:27.600 --> 01:55:31.880]  go and attack that spot but they they know where to pick so we go and I've
[01:55:31.880 --> 01:55:35.200]  confronted them on you know what what they were there doing and they told me
[01:55:35.200 --> 01:55:39.480]  they're monitoring hate groups such as the KKK neo-nazis and I said yeah Alex
[01:55:39.480 --> 01:55:44.240]  Jones and they said absolutely yes and so I confronted them on how they felt
[01:55:44.240 --> 01:55:48.320]  about Hawken the guy who went and shot the Family Research Center and said it
[01:55:48.320 --> 01:55:51.920]  was because of the Southern Barbary Law Center exactly and so they have a direct
[01:55:51.920 --> 01:55:56.200]  tie to a domestic terrorist attack when they make stretches to connect you to
[01:55:56.200 --> 01:55:59.920]  the LAX shooting and things of that nature when that's a pretty far stretch
[01:55:59.920 --> 01:56:04.400]  well and I say the you know opposite I say don't go out and be violent
[01:56:04.400 --> 01:56:07.440]  offensively but you went further tell folks about the catcher on the rye
[01:56:07.440 --> 01:56:10.960]  thing he said yeah he told me you know well I think that it's like the catcher
[01:56:10.960 --> 01:56:13.760]  on the rye with John Lennon thing where they read something and they want to go
[01:56:13.760 --> 01:56:18.480]  make an attack you know something like that but it's it's ridiculous because
[01:56:18.480 --> 01:56:22.240]  they try to connect you with these terror attacks and people Chuck Baldwin's the
[01:56:22.240 --> 01:56:26.520]  number one on their terror watch list and you know none of these people have
[01:56:26.520 --> 01:56:31.360]  been connected and the guys are pussycat oh absolutely listen they hate
[01:56:31.360 --> 01:56:35.480]  anybody that's real and says we should be honorable we should restore America we
[01:56:35.480 --> 01:56:40.360]  should be men again we should be be honorable they hate anybody they know
[01:56:40.360 --> 01:56:44.080]  is really good they didn't even like the confrontation of me simply just asking
[01:56:44.080 --> 01:56:47.440]  them questions he starts looking his pen around and getting really nervous and
[01:56:47.440 --> 01:56:52.040]  talking in circles and stuff it's it's pretty funny to watch well I mean they
[01:56:52.040 --> 01:56:54.800]  introduce bills every year to end the free speech I mean these are really
[01:56:54.800 --> 01:56:58.640]  creepy people and they're out there trying to get people to you know tag along

[01:57:07.120 --> 01:57:11.360]  the other new one is to attack the Alcatabasis on the moon the Californians

[02:01:11.960 --> 02:01:17.360]  lying maniac I mean Clinton was at least embarrassed when he said I did not

[02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:27.960]  lying he was like I shouldn't have done that but it's private not embarrassing
[02:01:27.960 --> 02:01:34.120]  Obama's like I never said you can keep your plan kind of racist said that that
[02:01:34.120 --> 02:01:39.960]  deeply raises Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen the NSA via satellite saw Alex
[02:01:39.960 --> 02:01:47.520]  Jones I can tell you right now this morning I got megas that came in this
[02:01:47.520 --> 02:01:56.000]  giant bag folks super sized racism ladies and gentlemen you know now you
[02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.760]  can wear a brown bag over your head you know as a kid it was always fun to cut
[02:01:58.760 --> 02:02:02.040]  out the eyes and you know do it and run around the house with the one that'd be
[02:02:02.040 --> 02:02:06.600]  racist but there's but I mean you know Planned Parenthood targeting black
[02:02:06.600 --> 02:02:10.920]  babies to be aborted on record it's not racist I mean chopping black babies up
[02:02:10.920 --> 02:02:18.080]  not a big deal just brown bags brown bags racist but you know why they're
[02:02:18.080 --> 02:02:22.880]  they're brown bags it's tough paper and it hasn't been bleached which costs more
[02:02:22.880 --> 02:02:27.960]  money so it's inexpensive bags and literally they're talking about the
[02:02:27.960 --> 02:02:34.360]  black hawks now Obama's Chicago hockey team that's racist as well even though
[02:02:34.360 --> 02:02:40.800]  the tribe called themselves the black hawks I mean I never make a big deal
[02:02:40.800 --> 02:02:45.040]  out of this I'm like three different ending groups always forget oh my dad
[02:02:45.040 --> 02:02:50.680]  actually as a kid would go with his grandmother and his grandfather like
[02:02:50.680 --> 02:02:54.880]  once a year they would actually go to the whole native ceremonies and oh yeah
[02:02:54.880 --> 02:02:59.080]  folks I'm pretty wild I have family like my father has danced around real
[02:02:59.080 --> 02:03:02.800]  Indian fires that's how we're at the point is I'm actually proud of my
[02:03:02.800 --> 02:03:06.240]  marriage but they understand it's like Comanche but that's not the ones they
[02:03:06.240 --> 02:03:10.000]  were going to visit it was his grandmother was the ones that are in
[02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:14.480]  East Texas in the swamps I forget this I can't even remember anymore the point
[02:03:14.480 --> 02:03:21.720]  is is that I was not telling that story oh yeah I mean I guess if you named a
[02:03:21.720 --> 02:03:25.880]  Midwestern team the Comanche's or the Apaches or something that would be
[02:03:25.880 --> 02:03:30.160]  racist just saying the name of the group is racist so I saw articles now about
[02:03:30.160 --> 02:03:34.840]  should the black hawks change their name I mean I mean it's an Indian name a
[02:03:34.840 --> 02:03:45.440]  native name it must be raises it also raises it just goes on and on and on and
[02:03:45.440 --> 02:03:50.840]  on actually I wish I would have got my grandpa's Comanche good looks my dad's
[02:03:50.840 --> 02:03:54.720]  dad my my grandmother my dad so I was almost like a midget she was like five
[02:03:54.720 --> 02:03:59.160]  feet tall really sweet lady and then my grandfather was like six foot three had
[02:03:59.160 --> 02:04:04.440]  black hair bright blue eyes and like brown skins by a movie star or something
[02:04:04.440 --> 02:04:11.160]  I wish I'd got those looks but the point is is that that's racist that that I
[02:04:11.160 --> 02:04:16.440]  just talked about my grandfather's black raven hair I guess that's actually why
[02:04:16.440 --> 02:04:21.000]  I was reading that's why the lot of tribes call themselves the crows and or
[02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:25.240]  the black hawks or the whatever because you know they liked birds of prey black
[02:04:25.240 --> 02:04:28.760]  birds were seen as good luck by a lot of the native groups that's that's racist
[02:04:28.760 --> 02:04:33.240]  as well that I'm actually giving you what's behind those names there ladies
[02:04:33.240 --> 02:04:38.120]  and gentlemen we'll be right back on the other side of this quick break I am your

[02:09:00.560 --> 02:09:06.120]  report that I'm not even in they just imply I'm a sexual predator online with
[02:09:06.120 --> 02:09:10.000]  the visuals so sexual predators you know extremist hate and put me up on

[02:09:19.400 --> 02:09:24.480]  ago three and a half years ago in Pittsburgh he had two pit bulls his
[02:09:24.480 --> 02:09:26.960]  mother said move out they were defecating and urinating all over the
[02:09:26.960 --> 02:09:32.000]  the ground he'd been thrown out of the Marines he was a white supremacist who
[02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:35.480]  spent all his time basically attacking me all over the web I didn't know who he
[02:09:35.480 --> 02:09:39.840]  was till after it happened I get the call I go he did this for you so then
[02:09:39.840 --> 02:09:42.880]  probably lost center within two hours was given that by the police that he'd
[02:09:42.880 --> 02:09:46.520]  visited my site he did it for me so we went and searched and found the guy in
[02:09:46.520 --> 02:09:49.880]  photos of himself this tattoo how much he wanted to come after me how he was
[02:09:49.880 --> 02:09:56.160]  gonna get me how I better watch it and I called the media and I said did you know
[02:09:56.160 --> 02:10:00.600]  he is a huge detractor of mine and nowhere praises me they and I'm going
[02:10:00.600 --> 02:10:04.800]  to sue you and they all retracted it but now they don't even care folks they
[02:10:04.800 --> 02:10:08.800]  don't even care how would someone who's a listener of mine because I'm mad
[02:10:08.800 --> 02:10:12.160]  about the TSA violate my rights and then somebody goes haywire and goes and
[02:10:12.160 --> 02:10:16.200]  shoots some people it's the fault of the system putting in things like this that
[02:10:16.200 --> 02:10:19.760]  create pressures that do this if it wasn't a false flag but they want to
[02:10:19.760 --> 02:10:23.200]  blame me in free speech just like they want to blame the Tea Party and send the
[02:10:23.200 --> 02:10:27.640]  IRS after them and try to shut them down illegally that's government oppression
[02:10:27.640 --> 02:10:31.640]  folks they are the oppressors now here's a report Darren Mcbrane put together of
[02:10:31.640 --> 02:10:35.920]  just a smattering of some of these and I'll narrate over the visuals of your
[02:10:35.920 --> 02:10:39.120]  radio listener but we're streaming the video at info wars.com
[02:10:39.120 --> 02:10:54.600]  forward slash show if folks want to also be able to watch this here is the clips
[02:10:54.600 --> 02:10:59.440]  this is a job of the FBI it's a false flag job you heard the reporter question
[02:10:59.440 --> 02:11:02.440]  as whether it was false flag job meaning you know it was just you know they're
[02:11:02.440 --> 02:11:05.720]  twisting it around to make it look like it's something else another entity but
[02:11:05.720 --> 02:11:09.240]  really is the government it's so sick and this guy's an idiot and you know the
[02:11:09.240 --> 02:11:13.760]  people put there's just madly as real questions thrown out I think that this
[02:11:13.760 --> 02:11:19.840]  internet stuff with this access now that people have has made more crazy people
[02:11:19.840 --> 02:11:23.600]  because people who are borderline crazy yeah who in there and become you can
[02:11:23.600 --> 02:11:29.120]  hate the competition you know you can't hear it on 60 60 stations and FM is on
[02:11:29.120 --> 02:11:34.360]  the internet and one hour at the website considered legit among the crazy
[02:11:34.360 --> 02:11:38.680]  these guys are mostly associated with a popular conspiracy theory talk show
[02:11:38.680 --> 02:11:43.160]  called info wars the host of the show's man named Alex Jones yesterday
[02:11:43.160 --> 02:11:46.480]  afternoon Matt drudge who's the purveyor of the most influential
[02:11:46.480 --> 02:11:50.720]  conservative website in the country the drudge report yesterday afternoon Matt
[02:11:50.720 --> 02:11:55.240]  drudge tweeted this he tweeted I privately told friends that this will be
[02:11:55.240 --> 02:12:01.400]  the year of Alex Jones one hell of a broadcast in such a homogenized media
[02:12:01.400 --> 02:12:05.480]  and this is from the most influential figure in conservative media who is
[02:12:05.480 --> 02:12:10.760]  not named Roger Ailes at Fox News channel and this is the guy he's now
[02:12:10.760 --> 02:12:14.200]  endorsing saying it's this guy's year you know what it's like to go to sleep
[02:12:14.200 --> 02:12:17.560]  every night knowing you work for a bunch of psychotic killers and you bastard
[02:12:17.560 --> 02:12:22.760]  Republican end up killing me one day hate speech now Facebook is apologizing
[02:12:22.760 --> 02:12:26.920]  for allowing it worldwide but can anything be done to stop the hatred
[02:12:26.920 --> 02:12:32.200]  which is directly linked into the IRS tea party scandal will have a factor
[02:12:32.200 --> 02:12:37.400]  investigation if you surf the net or listen to talk radio you know there's
[02:12:37.400 --> 02:12:41.920]  plenty of hatred being spewed Facebook having a terrible problem with that and
[02:12:41.920 --> 02:12:45.640]  recently he's agreeing with going after the major controversy this is a
[02:12:45.640 --> 02:12:49.000]  conservative postings have encouraged violence no this is a turn across it
[02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:53.200]  he's against women hate speech is not a difficult pause right there but before he
[02:12:53.200 --> 02:12:57.280]  goes back to me with my head swollen up in red this is Fox News has been caught
[02:12:57.280 --> 02:13:00.520]  taking people's faces and stretching them out to make them look deformed
[02:13:00.520 --> 02:13:05.920]  ladies and gentlemen Bill O'Reilly talks about sexual abuse of women and then
[02:13:05.920 --> 02:13:09.480]  cuts to a clip of me when there's never been any allegations no one has ever
[02:13:09.480 --> 02:13:13.200]  said that I treat women very very well it's on record I'm a family man
[02:13:13.200 --> 02:13:21.120]  ladies and gentlemen Bill O'Reilly is a pervert Bill O'Reilly is somebody that
[02:13:21.120 --> 02:13:24.040]  calls the police on his callers that disagree with him and actually sends
[02:13:24.040 --> 02:13:29.400]  people to their houses for free speech Bill O'Reilly is a guy that settles
[02:13:29.400 --> 02:13:34.400]  sexual harassment stuff real sexual harassment where women under him you
[02:13:34.400 --> 02:13:37.920]  know he calls up and says I want you know what the tapes are you know what
[02:13:37.920 --> 02:13:44.960]  he does and again I'm not in Bill O'Reilly sexual life if the women want it
[02:13:44.960 --> 02:13:50.200]  good for them good for you Bill they don't like you you're creepy you're like
[02:13:50.200 --> 02:13:56.800]  a big spider and and and you're going to accuse me of sex stuff when you are a
[02:13:56.800 --> 02:14:01.440]  known sellout who basically is blackmailed with all this you man you make me sick
[02:14:01.440 --> 02:14:06.480]  pal you really make me sick so let's go back to the rest of the pervert Bill
[02:14:06.480 --> 02:14:12.240]  O'Reilly here it is calling it worldwide but can anything be done to stop the
[02:14:12.240 --> 02:14:17.960]  hatred which is directly linked into the IRST party scandal we'll have a factor
[02:14:17.960 --> 02:14:23.160]  investigation if you surf the net or listen to talk radio you know there's
[02:14:23.160 --> 02:14:27.680]  plenty of hatred being spewed Facebook having a terrible problem with that and
[02:14:27.680 --> 02:14:32.640]  recently hatred against women has caused a major controversy postings have
[02:14:32.640 --> 02:14:36.640]  encouraged violence rape other atrocities against women hate speech is not a
[02:14:36.640 --> 02:14:41.360]  difficult thing to identify it's based on personal attacks designed to injure
[02:14:41.360 --> 02:14:48.160]  that's hate speech and Facebook knows sad fact is there is an audience for that
[02:14:48.160 --> 02:14:53.080]  but in a noble country a noble country hate speech and those who traffic in it
[02:14:53.080 --> 02:14:58.520]  should be rejected and shunned that's right and in a just country the abuse of
[02:14:58.520 --> 02:15:03.440]  federal power to punish conservatives or anybody else should be a crime we're
[02:15:03.440 --> 02:15:08.000]  going to be live here for the next two hours these rumors about government
[02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:11.480]  tyranny reached the mainstream they often start with an extremely popular
[02:15:11.480 --> 02:15:17.040]  internet radio host Alex Jones we're gonna look at the type of tyrants in the
[02:15:17.040 --> 02:15:20.720]  Obama administration and Jones claims he has two million listeners for his
[02:15:20.720 --> 02:15:25.000]  internet broadcasts and that millions more watches YouTube broadcasts and his
[02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:29.520]  dozens of documentaries he also has several websites full of articles of
[02:15:29.520 --> 02:15:33.440]  the spooky music fears of government oppression and a tyrannical new world
[02:15:33.440 --> 02:15:38.320]  basically looking at the federal government now as an as an occupying
[02:15:38.320 --> 02:15:43.640]  force basically a foreign occupying force a tyranny but that justifies a lot of
[02:15:43.640 --> 02:15:46.880]  bad behavior yes this is the same guy who has been selling the idea that the
[02:15:46.880 --> 02:15:51.280]  massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in the massacre at Aurora Colorado were
[02:15:51.280 --> 02:15:55.640]  actually fake they were faked as an excuse to take away no use and they were
[02:15:55.640 --> 02:16:00.240]  really leave us to really killed who have beneath the UN building I never
[02:16:00.240 --> 02:16:04.320]  said what I don't know you know you know you do fake it was faked for political
[02:16:04.320 --> 02:16:07.560]  purposes the same guy who says he doesn't believe the Columbia Space Shuttle
[02:16:07.560 --> 02:16:11.880]  disaster actually happened doesn't believe there was actually Oklahoma City
[02:16:11.880 --> 02:16:15.720]  ladies and gentlemen I never said that the Columbia disaster didn't happen the
[02:16:15.720 --> 02:16:22.120]  San Francisco Chronicle reported the FBI confiscated film video footage shot
[02:16:22.120 --> 02:16:27.600]  from an observatory of a laser as it came into orbit or came into the
[02:16:27.600 --> 02:16:32.720]  atmosphere a green laser tracked it for six seconds and it blew up it was the
[02:16:32.720 --> 02:16:40.080]  San Francisco Chronicle which and you know that I said it should be
[02:16:40.080 --> 02:16:45.400]  investigated that's what I said I didn't say it didn't happen I didn't say
[02:16:45.400 --> 02:16:49.400]  wasp or we're living under the the UN building that'd be better than who is
[02:16:49.400 --> 02:16:54.640]  living under it I mean it's just just total lies here here let's continue the
[02:16:54.640 --> 02:16:58.680]  Boston bombing was also fake it was faked for political purposes the same guy
[02:16:58.680 --> 02:17:01.560]  who says he doesn't believe the Columbia Space Shuttle disaster actually
[02:17:01.560 --> 02:17:04.680]  happened doesn't believe there was actually an Oklahoma City bombing
[02:17:04.680 --> 02:17:09.280]  naturally of course he also knows and sells the idea that 9-11 wasn't inside
[02:17:09.280 --> 02:17:14.520]  job so that landing gear that must be faked to the conspiracy continues in
[02:17:14.520 --> 02:17:19.480]  every tragedy the Info Wars Alex Jones world thinks they see a conspiracy
[02:17:19.480 --> 02:17:23.120]  Alex Jones should be disqualified from participating in Republican Party
[02:17:23.120 --> 02:17:27.560]  politics his crackpot theory shouldn't prompt actual hearings in Congress and
[02:17:27.560 --> 02:17:31.360]  they shouldn't inspire actual legislation in Congress and you shouldn't do a
[02:17:31.360 --> 02:17:35.760]  money bomb on his show when you are running for Congress do not fundraise on
[02:17:35.760 --> 02:17:39.560]  this theater of the absurd by showing yourself to be one with this right no
[02:17:39.560 --> 02:17:45.080]  more Alex Jones stop stop is info wars pickup lines people are making up it's
[02:17:45.080 --> 02:17:51.360]  just crediting you don't don't don't listen to him if you like info war if
[02:17:51.360 --> 02:17:56.720]  they really wanted to bring us down they would say have more Alex Jones who
[02:17:56.720 --> 02:18:01.640]  says we faked the moon landing and that 9-11 was an elaborate hoax and that it
[02:18:01.640 --> 02:18:05.720]  was secretly the White House that bombed the Boston Marathon Michelle Obama was
[02:18:05.720 --> 02:18:09.840]  totally in on it and also there was no massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School
[02:18:09.840 --> 02:18:13.600]  all of those things were hoaxes they were all faked by the government so we
[02:18:13.600 --> 02:18:18.160]  can be enslaved in FEMA concentration camps of the black helicopters and have
[02:18:18.160 --> 02:18:21.600]  our organs harvested for the aliens or whatever if you are one of those folks
[02:18:21.600 --> 02:18:25.320]  if you are a conspiracy theorist who believes in the Glenn Beck Alex Jones
[02:18:25.320 --> 02:18:31.600]  view of the world well that doesn't mean you don't need love tonight there are
[02:18:31.600 --> 02:18:36.040]  urgent calls for more airport security and lax and airports across the country
[02:18:36.040 --> 02:18:41.760]  as investigators are setting a shadowy subculture which may have encouraged a
[02:18:41.760 --> 02:18:48.280]  disturbed young man the TSA has a factless job enforcing procedures we all tolerate
[02:18:48.280 --> 02:18:53.760]  through gritted teeth a popular target no kidding who else wants a job grunting
[02:18:53.760 --> 02:18:58.080]  men women and children all day among some anti-government activists the agency
[02:18:58.080 --> 02:19:03.640]  embodies a federal government that's too invasive corrupt and incompetent but

[02:24:32.240 --> 02:24:38.560]  headlines when he called Obama a lying maniac and you know what mr. Mason how

[02:24:43.160 --> 02:24:48.040]  be kicked off of the kicked off of their insurance Obama says he never said
[02:24:48.040 --> 02:24:58.640]  that sir I'm being sarcastic earlier hello hello yes sir earlier I know you

[02:25:14.840 --> 02:25:19.560]  may be can you hear me now mr. Mason very slightly okay well tell us what you
[02:25:19.560 --> 02:25:23.320]  think of Obama and what's been happening well what's happening is that this man
[02:25:23.320 --> 02:25:27.200]  signed out to be the greatest liar of all time but he's been doing it since he
[02:25:27.200 --> 02:25:31.200]  became president everybody chose not to notice it because everybody felt a
[02:25:31.200 --> 02:25:36.160]  moral obligation to prove to themselves that they that they accepting him that
[02:25:36.160 --> 02:25:42.320]  they're enjoying him that they did that they fear him that they were paying
[02:25:42.320 --> 02:25:46.240]  tribute to him like he was some kind of he has some kind of a connection with
[02:25:46.240 --> 02:25:50.840]  godliness or holiness and it's a it's a somehow tasteless and obnoxious
[02:25:50.840 --> 02:25:55.960]  disgusting to somehow recognize him for what he is a plaintiff not loyal who has
[02:25:55.960 --> 02:25:59.680]  no conscience about saying whatever he pleases no matter who he writes no matter
[02:25:59.680 --> 02:26:04.600]  what kind of fraud is about had no matter how he persecuted his people like with
[02:26:04.600 --> 02:26:10.960]  the IRS or does anything in Marvel or at least I like telling a blade to light
[02:26:10.960 --> 02:26:16.360]  about that whole world recently with the like he said this is the red line the
[02:26:16.360 --> 02:26:20.080]  red line is Thursday the red line is Friday as I said the red line I remain a
[02:26:20.080 --> 02:26:24.120]  very red line I meant the people I may be a purple line maybe there's no light
[02:26:24.120 --> 02:26:28.160]  at all I don't remember what I said but but you misunderstood me because that's
[02:26:28.160 --> 02:26:32.320]  not what I meant he has all kinds of explanations and definitions that have
[02:26:32.320 --> 02:26:36.280]  nothing to with the L.A. because the red has no conscience and nobody chose to
[02:26:36.280 --> 02:26:42.640]  notice it. Whenever you come out and criticize our dear leader Kim Jong-un
[02:26:42.640 --> 02:26:47.080]  I mean excuse me Obama the media will attack you and say how dare you talk
[02:26:47.080 --> 02:26:50.480]  about our gracious leader I don't think we've ever had a president that is this
[02:26:50.480 --> 02:26:56.440]  big a liar do you think Obama should win the UN? He makes me look like an honest
[02:26:56.440 --> 02:27:02.440]  man he makes Clinton look like an honest man. Clinton said I spoke but I didn't
[02:27:02.440 --> 02:27:06.800]  know when you put a pastrami sandwich in your mouth if you didn't want to swallow it
[02:27:06.800 --> 02:27:12.920]  he has been a doctor trail that he kept pretending that they forgot to call him
[02:27:12.920 --> 02:27:16.680]  that he forgot that he forgot to hear it that he forgot to remember that he was the
[02:27:16.680 --> 02:27:20.760]  president that he forgot to remember he was looking for a job he had definitions
[02:27:20.760 --> 02:27:25.080]  and explanations that were ridiculous every day but at the end Clinton was
[02:27:25.080 --> 02:27:30.400]  basically harmless compared to this man he didn't run around persecuting innocent
[02:27:30.400 --> 02:27:35.960]  people and put the IRS he didn't create definitions that have nothing to do with reality
[02:27:35.960 --> 02:27:40.760]  that's because harm people and hurt people and destroy people he and this man has no
[02:27:40.760 --> 02:27:46.800]  conscience whatsoever and this man's words are harmful and they have vulgar
[02:27:46.800 --> 02:27:51.480]  and vicious take a look at he doesn't even care that he told everybody you
[02:27:51.480 --> 02:27:55.240]  could keep your plan now he has a different definition of what a plan is now he
[02:27:55.240 --> 02:27:59.680]  forgot that it has a different he didn't care about which country was in what he
[02:27:59.680 --> 02:28:04.680]  said and he doesn't even know if you're dead or alive when he's talking to you
[02:28:04.680 --> 02:28:10.000]  nothing matters but whatever he could come to his mind is what he says what it
[02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:15.640]  makes any sense or not when it destroys people or not how could a man have so little of a
[02:28:15.640 --> 02:28:20.000]  conscience while everybody was worried about hurting him he doesn't care about
[02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:25.520]  destroying anybody everybody is talking about protecting the first black president
[02:28:25.520 --> 02:28:29.720]  because we have to make sure that they're such a perfect democracy that we can't
[02:28:29.720 --> 02:28:33.840]  hurt a manager and he decides that every time you're hurt you're saying a
[02:28:33.840 --> 02:28:38.640]  criticism there is a thing they keep reminding you that he's black and the
[02:28:38.640 --> 02:28:42.720]  racism is behind it and while he's wiping you're out dude you're not allowed to
[02:28:42.720 --> 02:28:47.560]  notice it because he's black the fact that you're white is the
[02:28:47.560 --> 02:28:53.960]  became your biggest problem the fact that your wife makes you a sick old life
[02:28:53.960 --> 02:28:59.240]  who's trying to place you good people in a lot of generalize about a black man
[02:28:59.240 --> 02:29:02.640]  but a black man allowed to destroy all the white people in America nobody
[02:29:02.640 --> 02:29:06.800]  criticizing him for doing it because it's not based on this type of black man
[02:29:06.800 --> 02:29:11.600]  while he's wiping you out well he's definitely wiping all the middle class
[02:29:11.600 --> 02:29:15.320]  out and that's the Cloward and Piven plan in fact the architect of the
[02:29:15.320 --> 02:29:19.160]  Obamacare as you know came out Sunday and admitted the plan is to wreck
[02:29:19.160 --> 02:29:23.200]  health care and bring in total socialism

[02:33:46.960 --> 02:33:51.960]  admit I was blindsided by how bad Obama's been he should be impeached I
[02:33:51.960 --> 02:33:57.240]  believe for persecuting the Tea Party pro-life groups Christian groups so many

[02:34:00.920 --> 02:34:06.480]  look like an angel Jackie Mason.com is the website folks can find all your
[02:34:06.480 --> 02:34:09.520]  turd dates that are coming up I want to come see you next time you're in Texas
[02:34:09.520 --> 02:34:15.600]  Jackie getting into the Obama cult I mean people use Hitler analogies I think
[02:34:15.600 --> 02:34:21.040]  too much but Mao analogies Stalin analogies the cult of personality maybe
[02:34:21.040 --> 02:34:25.720]  a Fidel Castro analogy I mean this guy is a cult leader with his followers I'm
[02:34:25.720 --> 02:34:29.840]  really concerned with how they're buying millions of bullets and federalizing
[02:34:29.840 --> 02:34:34.280]  the police and and and and saying they want to arrest the Tea Party and saying
[02:34:34.280 --> 02:34:38.160]  George Washington's a bad guy in the new Army manuals I mean do you think Obama
[02:34:38.160 --> 02:34:41.680]  could try to become a dictator and what do we do to stop Obama?
[02:34:41.680 --> 02:34:46.160]  The truth of the matter is that it's very easy to stop the people are just too
[02:34:46.160 --> 02:34:51.400]  too wound up with the great pleasure that they're getting out of being able to convince
[02:34:51.400 --> 02:34:56.000]  themselves that they're great civil rights crusaders that they're great civil
[02:34:56.000 --> 02:35:02.520]  rights libertarians he became an excuse for people who feel guilty about the fact
[02:35:02.520 --> 02:35:05.880]  that the black boys never got to play their head in this country that he
[02:35:05.880 --> 02:35:09.800]  deserves about persecution of blacks and rejection of blacks and the black problem
[02:35:09.800 --> 02:35:13.320]  and the black problem multiplied in their conscience so much that they went
[02:35:13.320 --> 02:35:16.920]  let's try to prove to themselves that they're going to love this man no matter
[02:35:16.920 --> 02:35:23.000]  what that everything they claimed about being somehow an underdog because your
[02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:27.880]  black is exactly opposite it just creates a special privilege a special class
[02:35:27.880 --> 02:35:33.240]  now you want to be associated with me but that's but to prove to yourself that
[02:35:33.240 --> 02:35:37.240]  you're helping me a problem with him and getting ahead of life he became your
[02:35:37.240 --> 02:35:41.360]  way of proving to yourself that you're a great great human being and you're
[02:35:41.360 --> 02:35:45.680]  concerned and compassionate about the underdog by helping this man do whatever
[02:35:45.680 --> 02:35:49.480]  he pleases and whenever they hear any criticism of him they decide not to
[02:35:49.480 --> 02:35:54.280]  notice it you talk to any Democrat who loves Obama it's easy to criticize their
[02:35:54.280 --> 02:35:57.880]  mother that Obama if you say tell him I want your mother is all good they would
[02:35:57.880 --> 02:36:01.480]  say don't kill them I don't care about it but if you say anything about Obama
[02:36:01.480 --> 02:36:05.440]  shut up they can't stand it they would attack you though they'll try to get a
[02:36:05.440 --> 02:36:10.680]  truck and run you right over it don't destroy and kill anybody who has the
[02:36:10.680 --> 02:36:15.560]  word to say against Obama so he was a free man it's a sad commentary on this
[02:36:15.560 --> 02:36:20.160]  country that it took this long for people to stop noticing what a what a
[02:36:20.160 --> 02:36:26.040]  broken down character he is but a terrible unbelievable way around how
[02:36:26.040 --> 02:36:30.480]  he has no character and no conscience nobody even noticed it so now even now
[02:36:30.480 --> 02:36:34.440]  the Democrats are surrounding him and protecting him but this is the first time
[02:36:34.440 --> 02:36:38.960]  there's a crack there's absolutely for the first time a crack and they protect
[02:36:38.960 --> 02:36:43.160]  him this is the determination to protect him no matter what that's why his
[02:36:43.160 --> 02:36:49.240]  counterpart that he went down to 39 Jackie Mason it wasn't him it's been
[02:36:49.240 --> 02:36:54.520]  his popularity number right now would be down to number two or he would be in
[02:36:54.520 --> 02:36:59.760]  jail but but they're finally beginning to crack the loop but it took they had to
[02:36:59.760 --> 02:37:02.920]  lose all their money from their own pockets and they hadn't seen that they
[02:37:02.920 --> 02:37:06.400]  have no healthcare left and they noticed that their whole family might be in
[02:37:06.400 --> 02:37:11.400]  trouble by Thursday despite we started to affect them because they couldn't run
[02:37:11.400 --> 02:37:17.200]  from it anymore people are so selfish as someone concerned about reality when
[02:37:17.200 --> 02:37:21.120]  they were under the protective that they have to find themselves being so
[02:37:21.120 --> 02:37:26.200]  disoriented they're so thrown for such a loop but they be thrown out losing their
[02:37:26.200 --> 02:37:30.440]  rent losing their job losing their help or lose everything before they begin to
[02:37:30.440 --> 02:37:35.440]  notice what a what a low character this man Jackie Mason the famous comedian
[02:37:35.440 --> 02:37:39.220]  joins us he and he speaks out when he sees things you know we're going on we
[02:37:39.220 --> 02:37:43.320]  see major persecution of artists comedians Hollywood folks who aren't
[02:37:43.320 --> 02:37:47.040]  complete communist most the people I talked to are actually more libertarian
[02:37:47.040 --> 02:37:52.520]  or conservative in Hollywood but they're all scared because the system will
[02:37:52.520 --> 02:37:56.920]  persecute them and try to stop them from getting work we had him in a top
[02:37:56.920 --> 02:38:02.760]  national illustrator in here yesterday who's lost work because Anthony Freida
[02:38:02.760 --> 02:38:07.080]  because he's been critical of Obama I mean these people are not liberals
[02:38:07.080 --> 02:38:11.160]  they're authoritarians and you've called him out on that what do you think Obama
[02:38:11.160 --> 02:38:15.640]  is gonna do your smart guy been around a while now that his facade is imploding
[02:38:15.640 --> 02:38:20.360]  now that we learn that he wants to bankrupt the country to socialize it to
[02:38:20.360 --> 02:38:24.600]  make people dependent what do you think he's gonna pull now that people are
[02:38:24.600 --> 02:38:27.920]  seeing through him because I'm really concerned right now I think I think you
[02:38:27.920 --> 02:38:32.760]  should be worse concerned for the first time that you were before because before he was getting
[02:38:32.760 --> 02:38:36.800]  away with any kind of crooked thing he wanted to do because he was free with
[02:38:36.800 --> 02:38:41.600]  impunity to destroy anything now everybody is watching him very carefully
[02:38:41.600 --> 02:38:45.800]  now everybody is really frightened now they saw right to their face how they
[02:38:45.800 --> 02:38:50.560]  could be wiped out that this literally destroyed by it so now they're ready for
[02:38:50.560 --> 02:38:55.160]  him now it's really makes a crooked move the whole country even as some of the
[02:38:55.160 --> 02:38:59.680]  sides are beginning to crack and for the first time you need to notice that they
[02:38:59.680 --> 02:39:03.520]  better protect themselves so now everybody for the fight now they all got
[02:39:03.520 --> 02:39:08.240]  a gun ready to shoot before that they were running like thieves are ready to
[02:39:08.240 --> 02:39:11.160]  pretend that they didn't know what he was even talking about let me ask you
[02:39:11.160 --> 02:39:14.360]  this question sir and then get any other final points you want to make
[02:39:14.360 --> 02:39:16.560]  because you always have a lot to say I don't want to be the only one asking the
[02:39:16.560 --> 02:39:21.920]  questions again we're joined by Jackie Mason right now live on air what do you
[02:39:21.920 --> 02:39:26.840]  think really makes Obama and his is ours tick I think it's seven of them have
[02:39:26.840 --> 02:39:31.840]  praised Mao Zedong the greatest mass murderer in history I mean what's wrong
[02:39:31.840 --> 02:39:35.120]  with these people don't they know socialism doesn't work and is a
[02:39:35.120 --> 02:39:40.240]  nightmare well you can ask that about any socialist anywhere in the world there's
[02:39:40.240 --> 02:39:43.680]  two socialist parties and communist parties all over the world and still
[02:39:43.680 --> 02:39:48.160]  these type of dictatorships all over the world why do they still exist anyway
[02:39:48.160 --> 02:39:52.360]  if it's the same question people chose not to notice when he ran for president
[02:39:52.360 --> 02:39:56.480]  before his day that he was in a church where they were coming America crazy
[02:39:56.480 --> 02:40:02.920]  America crazy white people would be they made it this made it sound like he
[02:40:02.920 --> 02:40:05.720]  just happened to be there he didn't know what they were saying he didn't know what
[02:40:05.720 --> 02:40:08.760]  they were doing he didn't know where he was
[02:40:08.760 --> 02:40:12.800]  he thought he was in a different country on a different planet and you know
[02:40:12.800 --> 02:40:18.280]  no matter what he said is stupid as it was people bought it because of what I said before
[02:40:18.280 --> 02:40:22.640]  they were desperate to have a black man who somehow doesn't look like
[02:40:22.640 --> 02:40:27.080]  y'all shop well I know there's a president of the United States
[02:40:27.080 --> 02:40:31.680]  his mentality was level with this country with this system and he was here to
[02:40:31.680 --> 02:40:36.440]  destroy it from the first day and his great manager's partner the guy who
[02:40:36.440 --> 02:40:40.800]  lives was started off in his business was about not revolution every actually
[02:40:40.800 --> 02:40:45.240]  killed people I know it's crazy but I mean I mean that'd be like if you
[02:40:45.240 --> 02:40:49.280]  attended a weekly clan rally for 21 years and then said you didn't know what
[02:40:49.280 --> 02:40:59.280]  the clan was talking about I mean that church was so racist I saw sheets of
[02:40:59.280 --> 02:41:11.080]  publications I mean that's the thing we called the Clinton slick Willie I watch
[02:41:11.080 --> 02:41:15.840]  his lies and I guess the dam is finally broken they're so absurd he goes I'll
[02:41:15.840 --> 02:41:19.740]  hire no lobbyist hires the most I'll cut the deficit in half doubles it to record
[02:41:19.740 --> 02:41:24.480]  levels he says he says I'm not coming after any of your guns I promise comes
[02:41:24.480 --> 02:41:31.280]  after all of them I mean with Obama whatever he says it's the opposite
[02:41:54.480 --> 02:42:02.360]  well you know that's what bums me out is that they've got all the statistics out
[02:42:02.360 --> 02:42:07.320]  that the race relations have gotten the worst they've been since the 50s and it's
[02:42:07.320 --> 02:42:12.000]  just such a bummer because you look at MSNBC they are using race to divide
[02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:16.120]  everybody they are the ones pushing race what do you what do you say about that
[02:42:16.120 --> 02:42:34.360]  I mean how do we really bring America together all right Jackie I know you
[02:42:34.360 --> 02:42:38.920]  got to go you got another call coming in anything else you'd like to leave us
[02:42:38.920 --> 02:42:45.560]  with well that's about it for me I think I made all my points do you think America will survive
[02:42:45.560 --> 02:42:50.360]  oh I've gone out to survive because already the time around is happening
[02:42:50.360 --> 02:42:55.640]  when the guys the popularity goes down from 52 to 39 and a week and a half you
[02:42:55.640 --> 02:43:00.080]  can put your life is he's on the right trajectory all the way down to nothing
[02:43:00.080 --> 02:43:06.280]  good all right thank you so much Jackie Mason there he goes ladies and gentlemen
[02:43:06.280 --> 02:43:11.600]  what a character he kept doing that laugh is making me laugh he's just I laugh
[02:43:11.600 --> 02:43:17.720]  when I think about how ridiculous the line is and I'll have like nightline
[02:43:17.720 --> 02:43:22.120]  here or AP will call me or whatever I don't even talk to him anymore because
[02:43:22.120 --> 02:43:26.800]  they'll go you believe there's no moon landing and I said I never said that I've
[02:43:26.800 --> 02:43:30.320]  had top NASA engineers on to just say what really happened and they say we
[02:43:30.320 --> 02:43:34.240]  went to the moon but there was a lot of secret stuff so they show people some
[02:43:34.240 --> 02:43:37.880]  fake stuff no you didn't you so we didn't go the moon I'm like I'm just not
[02:43:37.880 --> 02:43:47.000]  gonna talk to you or they call up and say I just goes on and on I mean
[02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:50.080]  they're just digging through everything everything right now and the thing is
[02:43:50.080 --> 02:43:54.920]  there's nothing I've I'm hiding but doesn't matter they'll just manufacture
[02:43:54.920 --> 02:43:58.760]  something I was like look Rand Paul out of a thousand plus speeches the last four
[02:43:58.760 --> 02:44:03.720]  years and out of hundreds of articles he wrote there were two lines not
[02:44:03.720 --> 02:44:05.720]  properly attributed in them
[02:44:09.720 --> 02:44:16.240]  oh and look with his college buddy 15 years ago Ted Cruz gave $6,000 to
[02:44:16.240 --> 02:44:21.400]  accompanying international brokerage 6000 he forgot to put on his form oh my
[02:44:21.400 --> 02:44:25.200]  gosh he forgot I mean he obviously missed $6,000 the guy's worth millions of
[02:44:25.200 --> 02:44:30.720]  dollars in the private sector I mean it's like oh my gosh I mean you see him
[02:44:30.720 --> 02:44:35.480]  trying to destroy Rand Paul Ted Cruz right now the Republican leadership the
[02:44:35.480 --> 02:44:39.640]  Democrats the Republican leadership want to prop up Obamacare because they've
[02:44:39.640 --> 02:44:44.080]  been paid by the big banks and the number one contributors and the defense
[02:44:44.080 --> 02:44:47.760]  contractors and then who's next the insurance companies that are just really
[02:44:47.760 --> 02:44:57.720]  the banks and I'm watching the galactic train wreck and almost every Democrat I
[02:44:57.720 --> 02:45:02.520]  know smiles and goes yeah so what are the premiums go up that's to bankrupt and
[02:45:02.520 --> 02:45:06.240]  bring the whole thing down they will have true socialism and I look at them and
[02:45:06.240 --> 02:45:12.360]  I go do you have any idea what real socialism is going to be like run by
[02:45:12.360 --> 02:45:20.520]  these crooks and they just go and it's it I mean I know people that live in
[02:45:20.520 --> 02:45:24.920]  England I know people live in Canada it nightmare health care folks you get a
[02:45:24.920 --> 02:45:29.440]  brain tumor that's 98% operable I've seen this on C-span in Prime Minister's
[02:45:29.440 --> 02:45:34.160]  questions they admit this Tony Blair and I because this is one of the most
[02:45:34.160 --> 02:45:38.600]  popular questions that I've seen a lot and then the next to brown and then
[02:45:38.600 --> 02:45:44.560]  Cameron and they'll say my constituents had a lung tumor that was you know 75%
[02:45:44.560 --> 02:45:49.240]  operable they've done in the first six months had to wait two years and died or
[02:45:49.240 --> 02:45:53.120]  they'll say little Ginny McCartney or whatever the name of the girl was had a
[02:45:53.120 --> 02:45:58.240]  98% operable tumor a Spongino whatever they're called and you know I'm
[02:45:58.240 --> 02:46:03.740]  watching this and Fibber Toma or whatever the name is and but she had to
[02:46:03.740 --> 02:46:08.880]  wait 18 months and died and then I talked to Paul Watson who couldn't do
[02:46:08.880 --> 02:46:12.760]  work for about a week and he's like Alex I'm scared they won't let me see a
[02:46:12.760 --> 02:46:16.520]  private doctor you have to get permission oh they give me as a packet
[02:46:16.520 --> 02:46:19.120]  that's what they give the military oh you're feeling sick here's a packet with
[02:46:19.120 --> 02:46:25.120]  some Tylenol some Advil and some tissue papers and some hand wipes and a little
[02:46:25.120 --> 02:46:31.120]  thing of cough syrup you go home and Watson was coughing blood up and and
[02:46:31.120 --> 02:46:33.840]  finally he had to start basically threatening him he's gonna do a news
[02:46:33.840 --> 02:46:37.800]  article they gave him a little letter and said you can now go to the private
[02:46:37.800 --> 02:46:44.000]  health clinic imagine you go in and you've got strep throat I mean I've had
[02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:47.080]  strep throat before folks and literally you can't get out of bed it hurts so
[02:46:47.080 --> 02:46:51.640]  bad it feels like you're being stabbed in the throat imagine Watson was like I
[02:46:51.640 --> 02:46:56.880]  might have to come to America just to get the medicine fever's very bad they
[02:46:56.880 --> 02:47:02.480]  want I mean this is this is this is what it's like and these idiots look at me
[02:47:02.480 --> 02:47:06.680]  and they go oh it's gonna be so wonderful we'll get our free deal this isn't
[02:47:06.680 --> 02:47:10.160]  even like northern Europe the only place they can actually run socialism and
[02:47:10.160 --> 02:47:15.200]  have it work somewhat and now that's all going back up for 60 years because the
[02:47:15.200 --> 02:47:20.280]  the the the northern Europeans are so communal and so ordered just like the
[02:47:20.280 --> 02:47:25.720]  Japanese like crime went down after the tsunami crime went down when stuff was
[02:47:25.720 --> 02:47:29.840]  bad that the Japanese are just like northern Europeans when it comes to just
[02:47:29.840 --> 02:47:35.960]  crime rates so low that it just staggers the mind and yeah they have
[02:47:35.960 --> 02:47:39.640]  socialism and they have doctors and they have pretty good health care unless
[02:47:39.640 --> 02:47:43.280]  they decide you're too old and don't deserve this they kill your butt they
[02:47:43.280 --> 02:47:49.600]  let you die not if it's your choice that's that's fine no no they choose to
[02:47:49.600 --> 02:47:52.240]  kill you and now they're gonna teach your kids how to kill themselves for the
