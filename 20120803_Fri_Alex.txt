[06:13.040 --> 06:16.400]  performing gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could

[09:00.160 --> 09:06.080]  we are live ladies and gentlemen blasting out worldwide cutting like a razor
[09:06.080 --> 09:11.840]  sharp bayonet right into the guts of the globalist in the info war
[09:11.840 --> 09:19.800]  clubbing their lies wide open smashing their frauds to the ground like ripe
[09:19.800 --> 09:29.360]  melons under the club Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. central
[09:29.360 --> 09:38.480]  standard time back from the dead comes our republic ladies and gentlemen
[09:38.480 --> 09:44.240]  humanity is awakening and I am simply here chronicling it attempting to get
[09:44.240 --> 09:53.280]  people out there who have been deep in a trance to awaken and come alive we
[09:53.280 --> 09:59.240]  sleep they live we are culturally and spiritually dead the globalist are on
[09:59.240 --> 10:06.200]  fire but on fire for evil we have to become on fire for truth and justice
[10:06.200 --> 10:11.680]  and the enjoyment of standing up to the scum and saying it doesn't matter what
[10:11.680 --> 10:21.360]  you do we are now engaging we are now turning it loose we are now coming up
[10:21.360 --> 10:27.280]  against you and all your propaganda doesn't matter because history shows and
[10:27.280 --> 10:34.560]  common sense dictates and all experience hath shown that evil cannot stand up
[10:34.560 --> 10:43.520]  against good if the good keeps on a common that's what this is all about you
[10:43.520 --> 10:48.880]  see the corrupt have sold us that there are saviors and they love us and take
[10:48.880 --> 10:52.800]  good care of us collectively people are understanding that's not the case but
[10:52.800 --> 10:56.200]  individually we're fighting it in different ways or a lot of people are
[10:56.200 --> 10:59.280]  just sitting on the sideline because they feel disenfranchised they don't
[10:59.280 --> 11:04.040]  believe in themselves let me tell you something the globalists tell you you
[11:04.040 --> 11:06.960]  don't have power all day and it's a foregone conclusion that we're going into
[11:06.960 --> 11:12.960]  bondage because they're scared and they know the power you have and they're
[11:12.960 --> 11:19.960]  afraid of you using it they're afraid of you taking that first step leads into
[11:19.960 --> 11:29.240]  larger things big things have small beginnings all right let's just stop
[11:29.240 --> 11:33.920]  right there before I go into the customary preaching on this Friday the

[11:59.120 --> 12:02.440]  never succeeded sit back when I was first on radio I was more focused than I
[12:02.440 --> 12:04.960]  could go over hundreds of articles we're gonna try to go over this right now
[12:04.960 --> 12:20.480]  let's go ahead and begin let's go ahead and begin right here update Toronto

[12:44.600 --> 12:48.400]  intending to produce a show like the West Wing but the UN about how they're
[12:48.400 --> 12:53.120]  great and love us and they're all gonna save us and of course ABC just bought

[12:56.280 --> 13:00.400]  fathers and Texans and imply we're all terrorists who need to be arrested they
[13:00.400 --> 13:04.360]  have to now sell the new narrative that the threat isn't al-CIA al-Qaeda it is
[13:04.360 --> 13:07.560]  the American people that are aware of the globalist criminal activity the
[13:07.560 --> 13:13.040]  weekly standard also reports mainstream media blacks out chick-fil-a story that
[13:13.040 --> 13:20.080]  they sold out nationwide and that they've never had bigger profits than
[13:20.080 --> 13:24.000]  everyone is revolting against the globalist mafia tactic of saying if the
[13:24.000 --> 13:26.680]  government doesn't agree with your political views you're not allowed to
[13:26.680 --> 13:30.560]  have a business I mean it doesn't get any more Nazi Germany than that that's
[13:30.560 --> 13:35.760]  how the Nazis started out let's continue moving along to this little this

[13:39.680 --> 13:46.840]  Soros funded propaganda machine think progress falsely claims global warming
[13:46.840 --> 13:50.000]  melted street lights in Oklahoma and what did they do they knew full well the
[13:50.000 --> 13:54.840]  local news article said there'd been a fire in the downtown area of the town
[13:54.840 --> 14:02.480]  and it had melted the street lights that were by the fire well you didn't stop
[14:02.480 --> 14:06.880]  Soros and them you know say I should be shut down and Matt Rudge is evil and
[14:06.880 --> 14:10.400]  everything else so free speech is evil doesn't stop them from saying global
[14:10.400 --> 14:14.720]  warming did that it's like they say all the bears can't swim at penguins can't
[14:14.720 --> 14:19.800]  swim okay they're all dying whatever I'm done talking about it the point is is
[14:19.800 --> 14:24.560]  there is there is that little there's that little piece of news for you right
[14:24.560 --> 14:28.480]  there just it's every day you know they've got al-qaeda running jihad's over
[14:28.480 --> 14:32.800]  in Syria right now they're burning churches and burning synagogues and
[14:32.800 --> 14:36.080]  murdering everybody publicly and then the news points cameras and says Assad
[14:36.080 --> 14:41.760]  did it sobs actually a big stabilizer and an angel cake compared to al-qaeda but
[14:41.760 --> 14:46.640]  I'm unpatriotic as I was poor al-qaeda okay let's continue moving along I've
[14:46.640 --> 14:50.000]  got that whole stack of news big big war clouds right over here on the right
[14:50.000 --> 14:54.000]  hand stack we're gonna go from the least important to the most important and not
[14:54.000 --> 14:57.120]  that all this isn't important it's just that you know World War three type stuff
[14:57.120 --> 14:59.680]  you know might be a little more important than that I mean everybody knows
[14:59.680 --> 15:07.360]  what George Soros does continuing here woman 65 shoots it would be jewelry
[15:07.360 --> 15:12.520]  robbers in garden Grove you got to go watch this video we got it up at info
[15:12.520 --> 15:17.480]  wars.com a lot of local news actually cut part of it see that you but these
[15:17.480 --> 15:26.480]  five robbers pile in five robbers pile in to the jewelry store and they've got
[15:26.480 --> 15:30.920]  their guns and she just shoots into the ceiling which it was a one-story
[15:30.920 --> 15:34.120]  facility so I guess that's okay I would have shot directly at them that that'll
[15:34.120 --> 15:37.800]  really get them on their heels and they all pile out like a cartoon out the
[15:37.800 --> 15:42.440]  door I mean it is just amazing footage and it only got local news not national
[15:42.440 --> 15:47.320]  news and the police aren't so brainwashed to say it's wrong in New York she
[15:47.320 --> 15:51.440]  would have been arrested but in Orange County people are a little more pro
[15:51.440 --> 15:55.040]  freedom there one of the few enclaves left whether or not total absolute
[15:55.040 --> 15:59.640]  communist lovers and tyranny lovers but you know the most dangerous city of the
[15:59.640 --> 16:05.240]  world is Chicago they total gunman for the citizens and as soon as she shoots
[16:05.240 --> 16:12.120]  into the ceiling they all just run high speed and pile out that door I mean it
[16:12.120 --> 16:14.920]  looks like those old movies where they speed up the sword fights those guys are
[16:14.920 --> 16:23.880]  running so fast that's good but you can I'm always narrating stuff like we're
[16:23.880 --> 16:27.720]  watching and if you're a radio listener on XM 166 or AM and FM's all over the
[16:27.720 --> 16:35.560]  country the reason that I narrate sometimes as we have a sizable audience
[16:35.560 --> 16:39.800]  watching on the live streams at prisonplanet.tv if you want to go over
[16:39.800 --> 16:43.440]  there and check that out and see the nightly news and a lot more so there's
[16:43.440 --> 16:47.640]  one of those reports very interesting by the way I see these every day the
[16:47.640 --> 16:50.240]  latest crime statistics even from the Justice Department that are actually
[16:50.240 --> 16:56.000]  cooked to make it not look as good as it is is 22 I was saying 21 that was a
[16:56.000 --> 16:59.880]  number from a few years ago I looked it up guns are used to frustrate crimes 22
[16:59.880 --> 17:04.800]  times more often they're used in crimes of course look at places with more guns
[17:04.800 --> 17:09.920]  you have less crime I mean I sleep really good at night you come home invade you
[17:09.920 --> 17:17.360]  are gonna be in deep trouble real fast real fast and it's not because I live
[17:17.360 --> 17:22.400]  in fear it's because I live empowered hey we've got there about five articles
[17:22.400 --> 17:26.560]  here let's continue on with the next one here of about 200 why doctors are more
[17:26.560 --> 17:30.480]  dangerous than guns new health ranger investigation video Mike Adams is gonna
[17:30.480 --> 17:34.240]  be sitting in here Monday I've actually been coming to work most of the days
[17:34.240 --> 17:37.200]  where you hear a guest house every few weeks I'm just getting so much ready
[17:37.200 --> 17:40.640]  with the new news shows and all the reporters and all the new studios we're
[17:40.640 --> 17:43.880]  building and a bunch of other stuff that I just literally people say well hire a
[17:43.880 --> 17:48.720]  manager no one knows specifically what I know not that I have all the answers but
[17:48.720 --> 17:52.800]  for the info or for this type of media I am the world leader in alternative media
[17:52.800 --> 17:56.240]  that's been written about all the big publications admit it and it doesn't
[17:56.240 --> 17:59.360]  even mean we're that good with that we're not professional it's we're just
[17:59.360 --> 18:02.880]  trying to get at the truth we're not all big glitzy but we're trying to gear up at
[18:02.880 --> 18:08.400]  the next level and so I appreciate Mike Adams coming in on Monday Aaron Dyches
[18:08.400 --> 18:13.680]  and Rob do both of which never wanted to be on the air who I made go on air
[18:13.680 --> 18:16.640]  basically I didn't order him to but I said oh you need to become very good
[18:16.640 --> 18:20.640]  broadcasters and you see Rob do now on big syndicated radio shows around the
[18:20.640 --> 18:24.240]  country you hear him Aaron Dyches does a better job most nights than I do on the

[24:31.200 --> 24:35.080]  months before we're on record with guests saying it was a pump and dump of the
[24:35.080 --> 24:39.200]  biggest proportion ever with all the big globalist and Bilderberg group members
[24:39.200 --> 24:45.040]  involved that's why in Switzerland a year and three months ago at the last
[24:45.040 --> 24:48.920]  Bilderberg before the one in Virginia a few months ago it was Facebook people
[24:48.920 --> 24:52.600]  there with the head of the NSA they use it as a giant spying operation they
[24:52.600 --> 24:57.600]  admit that and they sell your data the White House is now being given all of
[24:57.600 --> 25:01.080]  your personal info to use against you that's in the news today I got a whole
[25:01.080 --> 25:04.800]  bunch of Facebook news it's all up at infowars.com links to it they're very
[25:04.800 --> 25:09.640]  loving people you know the the creator of it calls you dumb efforts he said our
[25:09.640 --> 25:18.560]  customers trust us they're dumb efforts very nice people very very nice people
[25:18.560 --> 25:25.040]  new Facebook tool may turn friends into enemies for the Democratic cause and it's
[25:25.040 --> 25:29.160]  some Fox News and they go on and report on the fact that they're just giving
[25:29.160 --> 25:32.440]  90 million users data to the White House and the White House is bragged about
[25:32.440 --> 25:39.160]  that continuing House urges Obama to fight UN web regulation I love this
[25:39.160 --> 25:42.720]  they're like oh the Pentagon just wants to take over the web and censor people
[25:42.720 --> 25:48.680]  and put control hubs in that's what the house it's moderate once oh but they're
[25:48.680 --> 25:53.160]  fighting the UN taking it over and doing the exact same thing and it's all
[25:53.160 --> 25:56.460]  two different hands of the same system that does the exact same thing that's
[25:56.460 --> 26:00.240]  why they're reporting in CNET news that the censorship that the Pentagon wants
[26:00.240 --> 26:04.840]  to the web Pentagon is already over the web illegally here again not our Pentagon
[26:04.840 --> 26:07.680]  it works for the bankers at the top you have to understand our country's been
[26:07.680 --> 26:12.440]  captured folks and to the average military person's a good person on
[26:12.440 --> 26:15.500]  average but not the leadership leadership's globalist they go into
[26:15.500 --> 26:19.680]  Congress and tell them that the UN is their boss I mean you've seen those
[26:19.680 --> 26:24.080]  videos you've heard it I mean we're now deep into this because the globalist
[26:24.080 --> 26:29.480]  transferred the power to the UN because they control it so it's not like it's
[26:29.480 --> 26:33.520]  taking us over the bankers took us over and created this new illegitimate group
[26:33.520 --> 26:39.280]  to officially transfer the power to you understand that it'd be like a bad loan
[26:39.280 --> 26:42.440]  officer at a house sale and then they really sit there and have you signed
[26:42.440 --> 26:47.760]  documents you don't pay attention and then they give it to their wife you're
[26:47.760 --> 26:50.880]  like but I was buying the house I just paid for they go no no you agreed to give
[26:50.880 --> 26:56.080]  it to my wife we're like oh your wife took over no no the guy in the room took
[26:56.080 --> 27:00.920]  over okay so that's what's happening here it's important to understand this
[27:00.920 --> 27:05.160]  it's not let's get out of the UN it's let's get the bankers out who hijacked
[27:05.160 --> 27:10.200]  this country through fraud house urges Obama to fight UN web regulation the
[27:10.200 --> 27:13.520]  house unanimously approved a resolution on Thursday urging the Obama
[27:13.520 --> 27:16.600]  administration to fight efforts to give the United Nations agency more
[27:16.600 --> 27:20.080]  control over the internet proposals to give the UN's International Telecommunications
[27:20.080 --> 27:23.840]  Union more control over the government and governance of the internet could
[27:23.840 --> 27:28.000]  come up in a conference in Dubai in December the moves reportedly backed by
[27:28.000 --> 27:32.360]  China Russia Brazil India and other UN members who themselves the global
[27:32.360 --> 27:37.160]  bankers have allied with see see the bankers are all playing nations off
[27:37.160 --> 27:41.440]  against each other and promising them if they sign on to the exact same proposal
[27:41.440 --> 27:45.360]  that they'll get the power but it's the same proposal even seen at news breaks
[27:45.360 --> 27:49.360]  this down what they're calling for is what the Pentagon's calling for that's
[27:49.360 --> 27:53.360]  what England's calling for and see that creates a global web the bankers
[27:53.360 --> 27:58.960]  control with all the nations clamoring to the globalist and the UN to be
[27:58.960 --> 28:04.360]  stakeholders in a game that's controlled and again it's not that the
[28:04.360 --> 28:07.920]  government's aren't sophisticated to understand this they're all infiltrated
[28:07.920 --> 28:11.200]  by globalist it's just when the globalist get a country that's up and
[28:11.200 --> 28:14.560]  he like Russia or something you know that has its own crime syndicate that
[28:14.560 --> 28:17.240]  didn't want to play ball with the bankers then they'll use other countries
[28:17.240 --> 28:20.640]  against it and they'll gang them up but to any time any country gets strong
[28:20.640 --> 28:25.120]  globalist bring it down that's why while they're debilitating the rest of the
[28:25.120 --> 28:28.880]  world economy they're busy really making sure the US economy gets screwed up in
[28:28.880 --> 28:32.360]  the the family screwed up and that everything falls apart because if we're
[28:32.360 --> 28:37.080]  a bunch of mindless drugged out jellyfish we're easy to control so it
[28:37.080 --> 28:44.600]  continues I've got a bunch of financial news that I want to go over I'll do that
[28:44.600 --> 28:49.160]  though after the break because it's a big stack and then also the huge stack on
[28:49.160 --> 28:55.000]  Iran Syria World War 3 Ahmed Denizide saying wipe out the Zionist government
[28:55.000 --> 29:00.000]  which is inflammatory but then the media spends it he says blow up Israel
[29:00.000 --> 29:02.720]  that's how they translated that's not what he said and I'm not defending him
[29:02.720 --> 29:07.440]  it just that there's lies there it's like the West is showing Al Qaeda atrocities
[29:07.440 --> 29:11.280]  and saying Assad did it and putting out fake photo shop photos which they admit
[29:11.280 --> 29:17.080]  and doing fake CNN broadcast it's just they're all bad it's just Iran isn't
[29:17.080 --> 29:21.160]  conquering us and doesn't he isn't in control of the UN in our military and
[29:21.160 --> 29:25.920]  our bank accounts and our police that's why the immediate enemy is the
[29:25.920 --> 29:30.880]  globalist okay if Iran was a real threat and did something you know nuke
[29:30.880 --> 29:36.480]  their military bases it's far more sophisticated than that so we're gonna
[29:36.480 --> 29:40.480]  break all that down coming up also there's an attempt to censor end game
[29:40.480 --> 29:46.360]  blueprint for global enslavement and it's being done by a robot not being done

[34:23.920 --> 34:28.040]  talk about this is it's a window into our future where machines run our lives
[34:28.040 --> 34:34.840]  that are programmed by globalist you saw six months ago or less when all my
[34:34.840 --> 34:39.240]  videos on the web where Joe Rogan had been interviewed by me over the years in
[34:39.240 --> 34:43.440]  studio going back like a decade people had uploaded them from other sources and
[34:43.440 --> 34:50.640]  places were banned or erased or had Joe Rogan monetization ads placed on them
[34:50.640 --> 34:55.560]  and that was because the computer bot for bent pixel a company had gone out and
[34:55.560 --> 35:01.840]  said that his voice was copyrighted and but specifically from live performances
[35:01.840 --> 35:05.240]  of his comedy because people were taping his comedy and then ruining it for the
[35:05.240 --> 35:08.760]  rest of people who hadn't seen it yet so that's fine you know Joe's my friend
[35:08.760 --> 35:14.800]  great guy a host of UFC TV host I mean everybody knows who he is and I had to
[35:14.800 --> 35:18.960]  get Joe on the line to get a hold of the company I couldn't get a response from
[35:18.960 --> 35:23.040]  the company at first and then once the company got involved they said yeah we're
[35:23.040 --> 35:26.200]  not going to do this with YouTube anymore because they are blocking and
[35:26.200 --> 35:31.600]  erasing everything and taking people's channels down we apologize well now with
[35:31.600 --> 35:39.160]  in-game blueprint for global enslavement been outs since 2007 what is that five
[35:39.160 --> 35:46.240]  years and the film it has been seen tens of millions of times online for free and
[35:46.240 --> 35:50.440]  one of the versions has had like three million views it's changed the channel
[35:50.440 --> 35:55.000]  or two and a half million views to be technical two million five hundred sixty
[35:55.000 --> 35:57.960]  five thousand two hundred forty four he's got a lot of our stuff posted on there
[35:57.960 --> 36:04.200]  he's got this version of fall the republic three point six million rise the
[36:04.200 --> 36:07.000]  police state one point five two seven million there's hundreds of channels
[36:07.000 --> 36:10.360]  that haven't mirrored with their millions of views miserable empire three
[36:10.360 --> 36:15.880]  point four mil obama deception ten point nine one six mil ten million nine or
[36:15.880 --> 36:20.480]  sixteen thousand four hundred seventy two and just goes on and on secrets of the
[36:20.480 --> 36:31.040]  universe you know all of these four hundred and fifty five thousand views
[36:31.040 --> 36:38.080]  and that's just a copy of one of our videos it's all right there and they
[36:38.080 --> 36:41.960]  they put a block on the channel and he's been given notice they're monetizing it
[36:41.960 --> 36:47.160]  at any time they could take the channel down with the Obama deception everything
[36:47.160 --> 36:53.440]  else on it and the hundreds of millions of views this channel has had this is
[36:53.440 --> 36:56.080]  another channel not our channel that we've authorized to post our stuff
[36:56.080 --> 36:59.960]  everybody's authorized except lawyers explained to me over a decade ago they
[36:59.960 --> 37:02.960]  go you can't not have it copyrighted though you have to say for non-commercial
[37:02.960 --> 37:07.960]  nonprofit reasons I have to keep that little caveat in there and it says that
[37:07.960 --> 37:11.040]  at the end of the films because people will go take your film and go well then
[37:11.040 --> 37:16.120]  I copyrighted and even though they can't win in court they just do it and so now
[37:16.120 --> 37:20.400]  this whole channel is in danger but do we have one of their songs queued up
[37:20.400 --> 37:26.920]  because biotronic project that by the way has no reviews on their Google site
[37:26.920 --> 37:31.240]  where they're selling it they have gone through a record company who now says
[37:31.240 --> 37:39.880]  that my voice is owned by them and see this is what it's the globalists have
[37:39.880 --> 37:44.840]  bragged they've got viruses they call them viruses just an order that goes out
[37:44.840 --> 37:49.840]  on platforms that will destroy and erase my voice your voice towards
[37:49.840 --> 37:54.800]  Washington's photo whatever it is they want destroyed they can just a memory
[37:54.800 --> 37:58.880]  hole it and they've caught the big book publishers digital book publishers it's
[37:58.880 --> 38:02.800]  not that a digital books bad it's great except it's got back doors built in
[38:02.800 --> 38:08.240]  where they rig it to bankrupt the physical book market where they go in
[38:08.240 --> 38:12.840]  and are now changing famous books like 1984 and Brave New World and making it
[38:12.840 --> 38:15.840]  more positive they've been caught doing that they've been caught erasing those
[38:15.840 --> 38:22.720]  off people's books even though they were paid for Kindle and others this is
[38:22.720 --> 38:27.720]  what the globalist said 20 plus years ago in MIT that it allows them once
[38:27.720 --> 38:31.800]  everything's digitized to erase everything so folks you better have
[38:31.800 --> 38:38.480]  physical backups you better create a market and save old VCRs and print
[38:38.480 --> 38:44.600]  machines and DVDs and blu-rays and I and man more and more we've this is a
[38:44.600 --> 38:49.440]  transition period where we're able to reach people because they're in the web
[38:49.440 --> 38:54.840]  transition where it's still somewhat free but soon it will be a hindrance the
[38:54.840 --> 39:03.560]  way the web is set up and no one is immune from this except someone like
[39:03.560 --> 39:08.520]  Matt Drudge and he's still not immune but he's very resistant to it as I've
[39:08.520 --> 39:13.640]  analyzed it a giant mega site around from the beginning of the start of the
[39:13.640 --> 39:19.040]  web that isn't based on search engines that isn't based on referrals off
[39:19.040 --> 39:23.960]  stories because he doesn't write very many stories that is just link based
[39:23.960 --> 39:28.280]  going in to see what he thinks is interesting and and and and the two
[39:28.280 --> 39:31.160]  guys that work with him think is interesting you know their their hand
[39:31.160 --> 39:35.480]  on the pulse it's not they're telling you what's interesting they have a gut
[39:35.480 --> 39:38.640]  feeling for what's interesting but but I don't want to go into an hour-long
[39:38.640 --> 39:42.920]  diatribe about this because I could spend 10 hours discussing it the point
[39:42.920 --> 39:49.040]  here is that sites that are based on search engine type stuff like info
[39:49.040 --> 39:53.000]  wars.com prisonblended.com we're also referral based because we had talk
[39:53.000 --> 39:57.000]  radio and other systems to push people to it but still them changing their
[39:57.000 --> 40:01.240]  algorithm and a lot of things has attempted to cripple us but our our
[40:01.240 --> 40:06.700]  ascension blast rate acceleration rate punch through those attempts the last
[40:06.700 --> 40:11.120]  few years and they didn't stop us that's why they you know my wife and people
[40:11.120 --> 40:14.480]  are like you're gonna spend every dime we've got going to the next level to
[40:14.480 --> 40:17.280]  expand our media operation I said well I've got to do that if we're even going
[40:17.280 --> 40:20.560]  to survive because we've got to punch through all these censorship and
[40:20.560 --> 40:25.520]  algorithm techniques to get outside the gravitational pull of the restrictions
[40:25.520 --> 40:30.480]  that way we can blast them from orbit to use that analogy okay and we've been
[40:30.480 --> 40:33.320]  able to do that and we've launched other salvos into orbit by the way the
[40:33.320 --> 40:37.680]  Pentagon uses terms like that as well like the state has a gravitational pull
[40:37.680 --> 40:41.880]  tyranny has a gravitational pull and you've got to be big enough to get
[40:41.880 --> 40:49.520]  outside of that and outside of its gravitational retrograde pull it's like a
[40:49.520 --> 40:53.720]  black hole so as it explain that I've escaped the black hole a few others
[40:53.720 --> 40:57.560]  have escaped the black hole algorithm changes have have have have hurt at
[40:57.560 --> 41:00.720]  certain levels we're on that daily that's good though because it's only made
[41:00.720 --> 41:05.200]  them diversify now they've gotten stronger but we have to be aware of the
[41:05.200 --> 41:12.440]  attack for all the rest of you that haven't gotten into orbit and then gotten
[41:12.440 --> 41:17.280]  out into a deep orbit where you're not being pulled in by the NSA Google
[41:17.280 --> 41:22.160]  freedom killer you I mean you are not going to be a factor soon if you don't
[41:22.160 --> 41:26.520]  absolutely go hog wild in the internet war you know what I shouldn't even get
[41:26.520 --> 41:29.600]  into this now I should do a whole special report and show exhibits and get
[41:29.600 --> 41:32.960]  into it as I think about this a lot and that's why I never tend to get to all
[41:32.960 --> 41:36.680]  the news because I'll branch out into an area and then just kind of go down that
[41:36.680 --> 41:39.440]  area of research and I just I'm not even ready to present all that
[41:39.440 --> 41:44.040]  information but is the research and development's going on inside my brain
[41:44.040 --> 41:52.320]  or isn't a research and development office around here the point is drones are
[41:52.320 --> 41:56.000]  already many of them autonomous all these guys you're going all we're not
[41:56.000 --> 41:59.200]  coward running drones we're heroes and then they're coming out announcing yeah
[41:59.200 --> 42:02.920]  the drones are being weaponized they will be used against you but they don't
[42:02.920 --> 42:05.960]  exist and aren't being weaponized against you domestically but they are
[42:05.960 --> 42:09.360]  but George Soros says they're not and the White House says they're not but they
[42:09.360 --> 42:14.360]  are I mean it's all just straight up psych warfare and so automated drones
[42:14.360 --> 42:22.120]  automated robots I got an article here you know I see an article this is how my
[42:22.120 --> 42:25.800]  brain works and your brain should work this way too I'm nothing special people
[42:25.800 --> 42:29.720]  been programmed to think one or two dimensional not three four five but when
[42:29.720 --> 42:32.840]  I'm explaining how you can think up to five dimensions ladies and gentlemen the
[42:32.840 --> 42:38.080]  point is is that it's hard to articulate though but if you could just think to a
[42:38.080 --> 42:41.560]  three-dimensional level that would be good see when I see an article about a
[42:41.560 --> 42:45.360]  twelve-year-old tasered because they argued with the police while they were
[42:45.360 --> 42:48.720]  arresting her mother at a victorious secret I don't think about him tasering
[42:48.720 --> 42:53.240]  the 12-year-old I go and look and see if victorious secret is participating and
[42:53.240 --> 42:57.560]  I found evidence they are like all the major pizza chains and most other stores
[42:57.560 --> 43:04.280]  that when they run your your credit card there's a warrant flag on that and and
[43:04.280 --> 43:08.240]  they're running that to the police because you know when you order a pizza
[43:08.240 --> 43:11.400]  they know you're usually using your real name a credit card and a real address
[43:11.400 --> 43:15.800]  and a lot of times you don't get the swap team right away and I think she had
[43:15.800 --> 43:20.960]  some parking tickets or vehicle tickets not parking tickets the point is she
[43:20.960 --> 43:24.880]  got arrested that's the issue is she went into victorious secret to get some
[43:24.880 --> 43:28.760]  clothes and and they should tell you hey we're running your background check
[43:28.760 --> 43:32.720]  you're walking into a spider's web here people are like oh well good cops will
[43:32.720 --> 43:39.120]  get criminals off the street yeah except that the the architecture and the
[43:39.120 --> 43:45.640]  posture of the police is being twisted towards evil the average cop salt the
[43:45.640 --> 43:49.320]  earth I'll be quite honest with you I've met so many over the years I know that
[43:49.320 --> 43:53.520]  the media actually has a plan to show bad cops to make the public hate police so
[43:53.520 --> 43:57.240]  we are driven apart from each other and cops are get into a gang mentality and
[43:57.240 --> 44:00.840]  think everybody's after them so they so they give in to evil because people are
[44:00.840 --> 44:04.280]  spitting at them and then the public sees that and gets more away we have to
[44:04.280 --> 44:08.480]  we have to take the police over with love and education and inform them and
[44:08.480 --> 44:12.360]  when they do wrong also punish them but they're all in the same boat as us and
[44:12.360 --> 44:15.440]  the globalists hate them even more than us they hate anybody trained to use force
[44:15.440 --> 44:18.440]  let's just be let's just understand that they hate anyone independent they hate
[44:18.440 --> 44:21.280]  anyone that lives in the real world they hate anyone who's learned to exercise
[44:21.280 --> 44:25.480]  authority okay you are machines to them that will be decommissioned when they're
[44:25.480 --> 44:29.400]  done with you that's why they inject the troops with soft-kill weapons alright
[44:29.400 --> 44:36.120]  let's continue here the point is is they can shut everything down now they're
[44:36.120 --> 44:39.120]  getting very close to it with the internet kill switches the phone kill
[44:39.120 --> 44:43.560]  switches the radio TV media takeovers again that I told you about 15 years ago
[44:43.560 --> 44:47.520]  with the documents people said this is crazy now it's oh yeah that's just the
[44:47.520 --> 44:54.800]  way it is that's why we're launching in September a free magazine it's newsprint
[44:54.800 --> 44:59.120]  style you know tabloid style not tabloid news you know the tabloid shape where it
[44:59.120 --> 45:03.080]  opens this way not not you know not like a big double you know paper it's gonna be
[45:03.080 --> 45:07.480]  about 62 pages long or so incredible information we have a lot of up-to-date
[45:07.480 --> 45:10.640]  news but also a lot of our big evergreen stories of the month we're gonna put
[45:10.640 --> 45:14.760]  40,000 up on the streets of Austin we're gonna mail 10,000 of them out with
[45:14.760 --> 45:19.000]  everybody that orders maybe more than 50,000 printed we're gonna have a 10,000
[45:19.000 --> 45:22.800]  left to put in everybody's orders that come in at info warshop.com we'll have
[45:22.800 --> 45:26.880]  bulk orders we can order them at cost from us and I'm not ready to roll this
[45:26.880 --> 45:30.320]  out yet then we're gonna in the next few months start a franchise site where
[45:30.320 --> 45:33.320]  if you're a printer or already a publisher or you want to get into it
[45:33.320 --> 45:36.320]  whether it's a hundred copies or a hundred thousand copies you can become
[45:36.320 --> 45:41.280]  a franchise and put your own news and articles in with ours and I planned it
[45:41.280 --> 45:44.520]  within one year of stuff hasn't totally collapsed but I have to keep going like
[45:44.520 --> 45:48.720]  like it's not gonna totally collapse we're gonna try to put it in every major
[45:48.720 --> 45:53.160]  city in the United States but only you can set this free and the reason is is
[45:53.160 --> 45:59.280]  is that this this site is going to be internet kill switch proof because
[45:59.280 --> 46:02.520]  they're my internet kills which they're just gonna curtail it regulate it start
[46:02.520 --> 46:06.200]  shutting it down we'll still be able to get somebody a file whether it's be a
[46:06.200 --> 46:11.280]  mail or whether it's through the the dark net and the other webs that are set
[46:11.280 --> 46:14.760]  up we can get them the PDF to still print it and this is all gonna be phased
[46:14.760 --> 46:19.240]  in so we're shifting now from internet warfare which we're gonna intensify to
[46:19.240 --> 46:25.440]  also creating new divisions of physical in preparation in case we're unable to
[46:25.440 --> 46:29.560]  stop this for the next phase of the operation and believe me we're gonna
[46:29.560 --> 46:33.280]  become more powerful even if I'm killed or even if everything gets shut down
[46:33.280 --> 46:36.280]  because when all this stuff starts coming true they're not gonna be able to
[46:36.280 --> 46:39.360]  erase it out of your brain you're gonna remember that all this was laid out
[46:39.360 --> 46:43.040]  you're gonna know the next steps of the enemy operation all right let's
[46:43.040 --> 46:46.520]  continue here ladies and gentlemen but that's the kind of issue we're dealing
[46:46.520 --> 46:50.480]  with we're all over the place our people are taking my voice saying they own it
[46:50.480 --> 46:54.080]  and shutting our videos down and of course I could sue them into the ground I
[46:54.080 --> 46:59.520]  don't have time just use the web while it still got some freedom now if you're
[46:59.520 --> 47:04.000]  not hitting your Facebook your Twitter your YouTube all the enemy platforms not
[47:04.000 --> 47:08.160]  using their system against them their matrix conduits against them in a
[47:08.160 --> 47:12.640]  feedback loop if you're not hitting them hard and culture jamming if you're not
[47:12.640 --> 47:16.400]  carpet bombing them with info weapons in your area if you're not calling it
[47:16.400 --> 47:19.760]  talk radio doing an access TV show starting a website doing your own
[47:19.760 --> 47:23.840]  YouTube videos emailing your friends and family our stories you're insane
[47:23.840 --> 47:28.160]  sort of just bunkering down with weapons preparing for the police to come so you
[47:28.160 --> 47:31.960]  can shoot them you need to be out there and shake my hand and getting them by
[47:31.960 --> 47:35.080]  the arm and going you know there's tyranny you know this is wrong you better
[47:35.080 --> 47:39.800]  get with the people you better be hitting them with info hitting them within
[47:39.800 --> 47:43.520]  their face because I'll assure you if you won't hit people with the truth if you
[47:43.520 --> 47:46.360]  won't get up before the city council if you won't stand out on a street corner
[47:46.360 --> 47:50.200]  with a sandwich board get the truth out you're not gonna pull the trigger when
[47:50.200 --> 47:55.640]  the time comes I will assure you and we don't want to pull the trigger with our
[47:55.640 --> 47:59.560]  guns we want to pull the trigger with our mouths and with the pen and the
[47:59.560 --> 48:04.800]  Cointel Pro attacks me for that because they hate it they know the pen is
[48:04.800 --> 48:08.440]  mightier than the sword they know the Pentagon says nine-tenths of war is now
[48:08.440 --> 48:14.480]  info war they call it psych war I call it info war they know that and the
[48:14.480 --> 48:18.000]  globalists are trying to use lies but we all know the truth you've got to hit
[48:18.000 --> 48:21.200]  them with the truth doesn't matter if they've got the big media outlets they're
[48:21.200 --> 48:25.640]  all being destroyed right now they're all us of what they were a shadow of a
[48:25.640 --> 48:30.360]  ghost a ghost of a shadow they they don't exist they're disappearing like
[48:30.360 --> 48:36.240]  phantoms at dawn like mist at dawn in the sunlight they've already lost that's
[48:36.240 --> 48:40.280]  why they're rushing forward with a revolution we're facing a criminal
[48:40.280 --> 48:45.440]  revolution because good is getting up on its hind legs we are the good guys we
[48:45.440 --> 48:51.920]  we the people must engage in an information warfare citizens arrest of
[48:51.920 --> 48:57.880]  the globalist by absolutely demonizing them and savaging them with hatred at

[57:02.320 --> 57:09.200]  has come out and said that Ahmed Denizide world forces must annihilate Israel
[57:09.200 --> 57:14.040]  that's not a quote though it's really not true I'm not defending Denizide he did
[57:14.040 --> 57:17.960]  say something pretty almost as inflammatory but he said the Zionist
[57:17.960 --> 57:23.120]  regime needs to be annihilated it means the government needs to be removed but
[57:23.120 --> 57:27.320]  whatever it's asking to be attacked Israeli Prime Minister says time running
[57:27.320 --> 57:31.200]  out to stop Iran's nuclear program Benjamin Netanyahu says that he'll
[57:31.200 --> 57:37.840]  decide and he says hey the military was against attacking there the Iraqi a

[57:42.120 --> 57:45.560]  may back it off but if Russia gets involved it's not pretty but the

[57:50.400 --> 57:57.960]  options Al Qaeda directs free Syrian army and control demolition of Syria it's
[57:57.960 --> 58:02.760]  I can't believe they admit Al Qaeda works for the government again continuing

[58:18.600 --> 58:21.600]  you know this homeland's expanding and they got all these TV shows coming out
[58:21.600 --> 58:25.280]  how its conservatives and libertarians are the new bad guys well that let's not
[58:25.280 --> 58:30.400]  miss words they say white people are bad so I mean it's just inherently bad to be
[58:30.400 --> 58:34.480]  a white person Syrian rebels add explosive expertise to guerrilla tactics
[58:34.480 --> 58:40.320]  that's Al Qaeda it's all coming up stay with us
[58:42.480 --> 58:51.600]  this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network this is Alex Jones with
[58:51.600 --> 58:55.360]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[58:55.360 --> 58:59.120]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[58:59.120 --> 59:03.640]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[59:03.640 --> 59:07.840]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity
[59:07.840 --> 59:12.480]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[59:12.480 --> 59:16.480]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[59:16.480 --> 59:20.600]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather
[59:20.600 --> 59:24.560]  is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[59:24.560 --> 59:28.720]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[59:28.720 --> 59:32.520]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar

[59:51.680 --> 1:00:06.120]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network big brother
[1:00:06.120 --> 1:00:13.480]  mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's
[1:00:13.480 --> 1:00:21.360]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[1:00:21.360 --> 1:00:31.400]  all right my friends we have a guest joining us author of eco tyranny he's
[1:00:31.400 --> 1:00:35.760]  really drilled into their statements their activities New York Times best
[1:00:35.760 --> 1:00:40.920]  seller you wrote climategate and his new book is eco tyranny Brian Sussman's
[1:00:40.920 --> 1:00:45.560]  gonna be joining us we sell this book at info warshop.com I should add discounted
[1:00:45.560 --> 1:00:48.920]  with a free citizen rule book with every order but that's a side issue he is
[1:00:48.920 --> 1:00:52.880]  coming up the balance of the sour will open the phones up to talk about eco
[1:00:52.880 --> 1:00:56.720]  tyranny because they that's what they are and they're brainwashing your kids
[1:00:56.720 --> 1:01:02.160]  you name it but we will continue with the huge buildup worldwide for collapse
[1:01:02.160 --> 1:01:10.560]  and war which is now becoming more and more of a certainty it's it's not a
[1:01:10.560 --> 1:01:14.680]  certainty yet but we are certainly in interesting times to say the least
[1:01:14.680 --> 1:01:19.440]  Wall Street Journal I'm gonna cover this more again in the third hour economy
[1:01:19.440 --> 1:01:26.040]  ads one thousand six one hundred sixty three thousand jobs okay now remember
[1:01:26.040 --> 1:01:30.280]  this is all with cooked numbers and that's what's so frustrating about all
[1:01:30.280 --> 1:01:35.080]  this they've admitted for over a decade they always had slightly cooked but now
[1:01:35.080 --> 1:01:38.640]  if you're off the jobless rolls you've given up you're living with your parents
[1:01:38.640 --> 1:01:44.320]  or you're on the streets which is millions of people that are that are
[1:01:44.320 --> 1:01:47.560]  living with family and stuff and just don't have a job or pick up cans or do
[1:01:47.560 --> 1:01:52.800]  stuff on the black market if you take them out we are in a total depression and
[1:01:52.800 --> 1:01:56.360]  and by the way they have articles today even admitting that but it's like still
[1:01:56.360 --> 1:02:03.560]  Obama and Romney will debate these fake numbers as if well six point three
[1:02:03.560 --> 1:02:07.240]  percent's better than what at nine point three when I got in and it's just all
[1:02:07.240 --> 1:02:14.520]  made up economy ads one hundred six three thousand jobs I listen in local talk radio
[1:02:14.520 --> 1:02:17.560]  and they're all debating these numbers and again I try to call in and they go
[1:02:17.560 --> 1:02:21.760]  no we don't want to have you on even when I don't even say who I am I'm like
[1:02:21.760 --> 1:02:25.640]  yes I'd like to announce that when people are off the rolls that they're not
[1:02:25.640 --> 1:02:30.720]  counting more so unemployment's closer to about 20% and I can give you top
[1:02:30.720 --> 1:02:35.800]  economists you know John Williams and others of shadow stats no thank you we're
[1:02:35.800 --> 1:02:40.120]  not looking for that right now call wise and I understand screening calls makes
[1:02:40.120 --> 1:02:43.520]  the show sound better sometimes you get folks that are really clear and focused
[1:02:43.520 --> 1:02:47.280]  but they always just kind of fit into whatever the fake debate is it's just
[1:02:47.280 --> 1:02:54.360]  it's so can and frustrating economy again adds that Wall Street Journal a hundred
[1:02:54.360 --> 1:02:57.680]  ninety five thousand fewer American jobs in July a hundred fifty thousand dropped
[1:02:57.680 --> 1:03:01.840]  out of labor force that's an accurate report out of CNS news so they break down
[1:03:01.840 --> 1:03:06.400]  the fact that it's really a lot less U.S. unemployment rate again it rises 8.3
[1:03:06.400 --> 1:03:12.040]  percent jobs up though that's AP Reuters job growth steps up jobless rate
[1:03:12.040 --> 1:03:16.600]  rises 8.3 percent so all the same headlines Reuters job growth steps up a
[1:03:16.600 --> 1:03:22.600]  jobless rate same thing and then I have an article here real unemployment rate
[1:03:22.600 --> 1:03:31.440]  shows far more jobless and that's CNBC I expect CNS news tell the truth but
[1:03:31.440 --> 1:03:37.560]  CNBC blind hog found an acre and broken clocks are right twice a day while the
[1:03:37.560 --> 1:03:42.240]  national unemployment rate paints a grim picture a look at individual states and
[1:03:42.240 --> 1:03:46.640]  their so-called real jobless rate becomes even more troubling and it goes
[1:03:46.640 --> 1:03:51.960]  down to break down the real number twenty two point one percent in the
[1:03:51.960 --> 1:03:57.240]  bottom California twenty point three it's more like thirty percent two years ago
[1:03:57.240 --> 1:04:05.320]  even CBS sixty minutes did that Rhode Island eighteen point three and it just
[1:04:05.320 --> 1:04:08.680]  goes over you know the fact that a lot of states have a lot higher yeah but
[1:04:08.680 --> 1:04:12.320]  that doesn't even count people that are off the rolls and only accounts
[1:04:12.320 --> 1:04:16.680]  unemployment rolls against those that have jobs Facebook stock crash hoses
[1:04:16.680 --> 1:04:21.760]  California tax revenue and of course they invested a bunch of the pension
[1:04:21.760 --> 1:04:26.920]  funds in that too so now that it's the state of California which apparently
[1:04:26.920 --> 1:04:30.120]  over estimated how much tax revenue was going to collect from a Facebook
[1:04:30.120 --> 1:04:34.240]  employees after the IPO you got the Facebook employees getting ripped off as

[1:09:17.480 --> 1:09:21.640]  environmentalism to push all their taxes and their monopoly system of picking
[1:09:21.640 --> 1:09:28.160]  winners and losers this is really their you know magic little key to bringing in
[1:09:28.160 --> 1:09:33.800]  socialism and globalism that's what richard in haas the head of the cfr wrote
[1:09:33.800 --> 1:09:39.160]  in 93 the club of rome you can look this up he wrote a whole article and he
[1:09:39.160 --> 1:09:43.000]  said we're going to use a pincer attack the threat of terrorism to get the right
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:47.520]  wing to give their rights up and the environmental situation to take rights
[1:09:47.520 --> 1:09:52.440]  with the left and with those two things we're going to get everybody and so
[1:09:52.440 --> 1:09:56.280]  that is the basic program there they're coming up in the next hour open phones
[1:09:56.280 --> 1:10:00.080]  that will take some calls later in this hour we're going to get into the
[1:10:00.080 --> 1:10:04.360]  deteriorating situation when you know it's been close to war a lot generals
[1:10:04.360 --> 1:10:08.680]  have said no one resigned joint chiefs have resigned but demsy says he's ready
[1:10:08.680 --> 1:10:13.640]  to attack Iran with Israel basically Iran's putting out its rhetoric about
[1:10:13.640 --> 1:10:17.520]  you know blowing up the Zionist state and all this stuff got those quotes out
[1:10:17.520 --> 1:10:23.280]  of Ahmadinejad they're the globalists are using jihadi al-qaeda groups to
[1:10:23.280 --> 1:10:27.600]  attack Libyan bring it down in now Syria I mean there's wars going on all over
[1:10:27.600 --> 1:10:31.280]  the place proxy wars but Russia is threatening all sorts of stuff we have
[1:10:31.280 --> 1:10:35.840]  Paul Watson's report from yesterday that guys will you repull that for me with
[1:10:35.840 --> 1:10:40.920]  the Pravda and other Russian Novostat reporting they're putting nukes back in
[1:10:40.920 --> 1:10:44.560]  Cuba I don't know if that's true but that's big news you know there's
[1:10:44.560 --> 1:10:48.360]  Russian submarines again off the US coast they've had their big bearer
[1:10:48.360 --> 1:10:52.080]  aircraft and others with nukes flying into US airspace that hadn't happened in
[1:10:52.080 --> 1:10:56.120]  decades a lot of craziness going on we're going to be discussing including the
[1:10:56.120 --> 1:11:00.840]  economy and what's happening there coming up in the next hour but we are
[1:11:00.840 --> 1:11:03.880]  joined here with I guess his maiden visit with us first he's been on before I
[1:11:03.880 --> 1:11:06.880]  can't remember we had so many great guests and we sell this book by the way
[1:11:06.880 --> 1:11:11.280]  it's world that daily books very very well done because you know I like to
[1:11:11.280 --> 1:11:14.200]  think of myself as an expert on this stuff but I did read the book a few
[1:11:14.200 --> 1:11:20.480]  weeks ago and it reminded me of so much I'd forgotten but also learned a lot in
[1:11:20.480 --> 1:11:24.840]  here about how they operate but it is eco-territy that's what it is and the
[1:11:24.840 --> 1:11:28.200]  leaders of it know it's tearing it's not about saving the environment it's about
[1:11:28.200 --> 1:11:32.400]  power grabbing and they want to post industrial world he's got the quotes in
[1:11:32.400 --> 1:11:35.280]  here how they want to shut everything down where only they can operate just
[1:11:35.280 --> 1:11:39.160]  like Obama shutting down hundreds of power plants power outages everywhere as
[1:11:39.160 --> 1:11:42.840]  we knew what happened but General Electric got a waiver two years ago and
[1:11:42.840 --> 1:11:47.440]  other insiders do so now they make more money selling more power at higher
[1:11:47.440 --> 1:11:52.000]  prices I mean it's pure gangsterism and it's a book everybody should get an
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:56.920]  info warshop.com our bookstores everywhere eco-territy provides a thought
[1:11:56.920 --> 1:12:01.080]  provoking analysis of the origins of the modern-day sustainable movement
[1:12:01.080 --> 1:12:05.240]  Senator James Inhofe the best champion the Senate fighting these tyrants
[1:12:05.240 --> 1:12:10.800]  author of the greatest hoax and again we're carrying both the greatest hoax
[1:12:10.800 --> 1:12:14.960]  and eco-territy and info warshop.com because both of his books are just so
[1:12:14.960 --> 1:12:19.560]  powerful and he joins us now because I mean this is one of the biggest threats
[1:12:19.560 --> 1:12:23.240]  out there and they don't care they got caught engaging in fraud they don't care
[1:12:23.240 --> 1:12:28.160]  they got caught saying polar bears couldn't swim. George Soros's White House
[1:12:28.160 --> 1:12:32.000]  Group openly run by the former White House transition chief their think
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:35.640]  progress it says alternative media should be shut down and that my funding
[1:12:35.640 --> 1:12:39.960]  should be shut down and wherever that comes from it comes from sponsors kind
[1:12:39.960 --> 1:12:46.520]  of crazy they think but side issue they are now in Oklahoma saying oh my gosh
[1:12:46.520 --> 1:12:51.520]  look a photo of melted street lights but the the article at Oklahoma that they
[1:12:51.520 --> 1:12:55.960]  didn't note a note over the George Soros outfit was that they were next to a
[1:12:55.960 --> 1:13:04.000]  building fire that's why the glass melted so and this is a daily folks they
[1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:06.680]  say polar bears can't swim there's a greatest land swimming animal they've
[1:13:06.680 --> 1:13:10.360]  been recorded swimming over 200 miles their numbers are up five fold the
[1:13:10.360 --> 1:13:14.680]  government admits since the 50s I mean they're everywhere they're basically
[1:13:14.680 --> 1:13:19.000]  giant cockroaches you know it invading areas aren't even frozen now stealing
[1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:23.200]  food and breaking into things I mean I like polar bears the point is it's a
[1:13:23.200 --> 1:13:28.880]  joke how many of them there are and and again that's how dumb they think you are
[1:13:28.880 --> 1:13:34.040]  now Al Gore's putting out stuff showing showing penguins on a piece of ice in
[1:13:34.040 --> 1:13:38.680]  Antarctica claiming they can't swim or implying that so the reason we've got
[1:13:38.680 --> 1:13:42.360]  our guests with us for the rest of the hour is to go back only to go back and
[1:13:42.360 --> 1:13:47.280]  look at you remind people what happened three years ago at Copenhagen and then
[1:13:47.280 --> 1:13:51.400]  now since then they've gone more underground but a lot of times when they
[1:13:51.400 --> 1:13:56.000]  go underground they come back even more vicious just like this is a battle
[1:13:56.000 --> 1:13:59.720]  called by Joel Klein in the latest time magazine in the August 6 issue he says
[1:13:59.720 --> 1:14:03.520]  how guns won why Americans have turned against gun control but then the whole
[1:14:03.520 --> 1:14:07.200]  thing is oh you know you need a salt weapon for hunting as if the Second
[1:14:07.200 --> 1:14:11.720]  Amendment's for hunting and you know we're gonna have new reasonable ways and
[1:14:11.720 --> 1:14:15.640]  all the Republican leadership down the line from Michael Savage to Bill
[1:14:15.640 --> 1:14:20.560]  Crystal Rupert Murdoch says it's time to ban semi-auto so you got the whole
[1:14:20.560 --> 1:14:24.240]  establishment circling the wagons because they know there's a libertarian
[1:14:24.240 --> 1:14:29.040]  constitutionalist real conservative revolution that is gonna overthrow the
[1:14:29.040 --> 1:14:32.440]  entire corrupt system now I'm done ranting I'm not gonna go over our whole
[1:14:32.440 --> 1:14:38.480]  guest here but 20 years he was Bay Area's top television meteorologist and
[1:14:38.480 --> 1:14:42.880]  science reporter that's why he's such an expert to speak on this his accolades
[1:14:42.880 --> 1:14:47.400]  including Lee to dozen state regional awards for best weathercaster and from
[1:14:47.400 --> 1:14:52.840]  the Associated Press radio TV director association and a handful of Emmys only
[1:14:52.840 --> 1:14:56.960]  a handful had an award of merit from the actual education association he's
[1:14:56.960 --> 1:15:01.520]  recognized by the state of California for assisting in the adoption of foster
[1:15:01.520 --> 1:15:05.680]  children through the organization Brian's kids 400 foster children were
[1:15:05.680 --> 1:15:10.760]  placed in permanent families from 89 2001 he's hosted two-hour evening talk
[1:15:10.760 --> 1:15:14.600]  radio show in 2009 his program become the highest rated on the station
[1:15:14.600 --> 1:15:19.240]  Suspin was voted to headline the KSFO morning show I'm not gonna read any
[1:15:19.240 --> 1:15:23.160]  more we got him here because he's an author and a meteorologist sir good to
[1:15:23.160 --> 1:15:29.080]  have you join us you got the floor tell us the state of the eco fascist and you
[1:15:29.080 --> 1:15:33.800]  know give us a weather report on the enemy formations Alex the first thing I
[1:15:33.800 --> 1:15:37.800]  have to say is this is my maiden voyage in your program and I feel as if we're
[1:15:37.800 --> 1:15:41.560]  brothers from different mothers because we both became enlightened by the same
[1:15:41.560 --> 1:15:46.480]  book none dare call it conspiracy that's where the light went off for me in the
[1:15:46.480 --> 1:15:50.920]  early 80s and quite frankly that's why I ended up leaving network television
[1:15:50.920 --> 1:15:56.520]  because the newscasts were obviously so biased and so controlled and so
[1:15:56.520 --> 1:16:00.280]  anti-liberty that I had to get out so again sir it's a pleasure to be with
[1:16:00.280 --> 1:16:03.080]  you well it's a pleasure to have you and I'm sorry I ran in for five minutes while
[1:16:03.080 --> 1:16:06.800]  you're on hold but we got you on Skype a bit late a breakdown from your deep
[1:16:06.800 --> 1:16:11.240]  research who the environmental movement is what their goal is and again the
[1:16:11.240 --> 1:16:14.720]  current state of their criminal takeover and it is a criminal takeover
[1:16:14.720 --> 1:16:18.200]  there's no question about this and this has been in the mix for a long time Alex
[1:16:18.200 --> 1:16:22.760]  when I wrote my book climategate I was just trying to unfold the global warming
[1:16:22.760 --> 1:16:26.480]  scam and one easy to read book where people could get all the information
[1:16:26.480 --> 1:16:30.560]  they wanted but when I was concluding climategate I realized wait a second it's
[1:16:30.560 --> 1:16:36.280]  not just global warming that's a scam it's the entire environmental movement so
[1:16:36.280 --> 1:16:40.240]  I started doing my research just as you would do and I started reading lots of
[1:16:40.240 --> 1:16:44.440]  stuff and I'm a guy I like to read Karl Marx and Frederick Engels because I
[1:16:44.440 --> 1:16:49.000]  want to know where the enemy is coming from I came across something that Marx
[1:16:49.000 --> 1:16:53.880]  and Engels wrote in 1883 now as you know your listeners know your viewers know
[1:16:53.880 --> 1:16:59.080]  these guys hated capitalism they hated free markets they hated private
[1:16:59.080 --> 1:17:05.240]  property rights they came up with a scenario that capitalism is polluting
[1:17:05.240 --> 1:17:10.000]  the atmosphere and that pollution could actually change the weather and change
[1:17:10.000 --> 1:17:14.080]  the climate and bring about another ice age which would kill all human species
[1:17:14.080 --> 1:17:18.840]  they proposed this in 1883 they thought if we can scare the hell out of them with
[1:17:18.840 --> 1:17:23.720]  weather then we can get them on to our side move them from capitalism bring
[1:17:23.720 --> 1:17:29.040]  them over to socialism and Alex the left hasn't left this scare-tacked ever
[1:17:29.040 --> 1:17:32.520]  since it's not about clean air and clean water the environmental movement is
[1:17:32.520 --> 1:17:37.760]  absolutely about control and changing the system as Van Jones once said
[1:17:37.760 --> 1:17:42.200]  changing the system from free markets and capitalism to socialism and tyranny
[1:17:42.200 --> 1:17:48.560]  then genuine well you really have to take it from Karl Marx who wrote all
[1:17:48.560 --> 1:17:54.640]  about this to Vladimir Lenin who first invoked all of this upon people you know
[1:17:54.640 --> 1:17:58.560]  Karl Marx and Frederick Engels wrote a lot about the environment they believed
[1:17:58.560 --> 1:18:03.680]  that no one had a right to own any natural resource they believe that the
[1:18:03.680 --> 1:18:07.680]  natural resources belong to the state just as they believe property belong to
[1:18:07.680 --> 1:18:11.800]  the state just as they believe that rights belong to the state and would be
[1:18:11.800 --> 1:18:15.880]  issued by the state so the first guy to take what they wrote and actually
[1:18:15.880 --> 1:18:20.880]  instituted was Vladimir Lenin and his environmental policy you look at some of
[1:18:20.880 --> 1:18:24.960]  the things he wrote on land on forests on hunting right on down the line these
[1:18:24.960 --> 1:18:28.720]  were large papers of Vladimir Lenin wrote because he was quite the academic
[1:18:28.720 --> 1:18:33.960]  scholar what we're doing in the United States of America basically mimics what

[1:24:12.160 --> 1:24:17.000]  eco tyranny at info warshop.com if you want to support all of our work but you
[1:24:17.000 --> 1:24:20.560]  may think you know it all you can learn a lot in these well-written books but
[1:24:20.560 --> 1:24:25.400]  more importantly buy it and give it to somebody because they want the moral
[1:24:25.400 --> 1:24:30.120]  authority as a pretext it has communists and socialists wreck the
[1:24:30.120 --> 1:24:33.080]  countries they're in control of they're not worried about real environmental
[1:24:33.080 --> 1:24:36.840]  issues here in Austin they take property for the you know the 20 years I live
[1:24:36.840 --> 1:24:40.640]  here from people pay them nothing in some cases and then give it to their
[1:24:40.640 --> 1:24:44.680]  friends to build on I mean I've been at smart growth meetings where they laugh
[1:24:44.680 --> 1:24:50.160]  at me when my camera is off and say yeah we're taking over so I have found that at
[1:24:50.160 --> 1:24:54.080]  the upper levels they are they they know they're criminals just just be clear
[1:24:54.080 --> 1:24:58.560]  and they it's an anti-human agenda they want to reduce world population it's a
[1:24:58.560 --> 1:25:03.120]  form of being conquered and the quotes are all out there I mean so when we say
[1:25:03.120 --> 1:25:09.440]  they're diabolical they're criminal we're not joking around okay and and I'm
[1:25:09.440 --> 1:25:12.800]  showing a map from the Bureau of Land Management right now some states are
[1:25:12.800 --> 1:25:16.920]  upwards of 90% like Nevada government and guess what they're trying to take the
[1:25:16.920 --> 1:25:22.040]  rest of the land they are getting land all over the country they're using
[1:25:22.040 --> 1:25:27.080]  taxpayer money to do it and again if you're a radio listener I'm showing this
[1:25:27.080 --> 1:25:31.760]  on prisonplanet.tv going back to our guest Brian I mean this is such a big
[1:25:31.760 --> 1:25:35.560]  subject continuing with their tyranny but I want to get into from your
[1:25:35.560 --> 1:25:39.920]  perspective where they are now the way they've changed their their guilt-based
[1:25:39.920 --> 1:25:44.840]  takeover yeah it is guilt-based and and you were really one of the first major
[1:25:44.840 --> 1:25:49.840]  voices to expose agenda 21 and that's really what we're getting here that the
[1:25:49.840 --> 1:25:55.240]  agenda for the 21st century is crafted by the United Nations specifically that
[1:25:55.240 --> 1:26:00.360]  mysterious character Maurice Strong who even conjured up the term sustainable
[1:26:00.360 --> 1:26:04.840]  development so what they've been able to do without assigning any treaties they've
[1:26:04.840 --> 1:26:08.160]  made this soft law in the United States we have so many people that are
[1:26:08.160 --> 1:26:11.640]  beholden to whatever the UN wants to impose upon the people of the United
[1:26:11.640 --> 1:26:16.520]  States that this agenda has warmed its way into every level of government in the
[1:26:16.520 --> 1:26:21.680]  United States city county state federal etc but again this is all about
[1:26:21.680 --> 1:26:25.320]  control and you just touched on one of the key points population control these
[1:26:25.320 --> 1:26:28.960]  are people who believe there are too many people on the planet not enough
[1:26:28.960 --> 1:26:33.520]  resources for the planet or at least that's what they say Alex because they
[1:26:33.520 --> 1:26:38.040]  throw out a lot of garbage which is designed to give them power for example
[1:26:38.040 --> 1:26:42.280]  in an agenda 21 they want to redefine consumption patterns they want to
[1:26:42.280 --> 1:26:47.040]  redefine wealth they want to change population patterns agenda 21 has came
[1:26:47.040 --> 1:26:52.000]  up with this this phony baloney nonsense of green jobs or even smart meters and
[1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:56.760]  the smart grid and and smart cities as you just mentioned so all of this comes
[1:26:56.760 --> 1:27:01.160]  from them and again it's all about changing the way in which we live and
[1:27:01.160 --> 1:27:07.640]  subjecting us to a form of tyranny I mean you've written several books on this
[1:27:07.640 --> 1:27:13.280]  subject and what is the most egregious thing you think they're pushing for
[1:27:13.280 --> 1:27:19.040]  right now worldwide well worldwide if you talk to any of these people and if
[1:27:19.040 --> 1:27:22.920]  you can just get them as you have done when your cameras are off you know it's
[1:27:22.920 --> 1:27:25.960]  interesting when the cameras are off they'll start talking I've been able to
[1:27:25.960 --> 1:27:29.800]  do this on a number of occasions when my cameras are off I've been able to do this
[1:27:29.800 --> 1:27:32.840]  on a number of occasions but I better apply them maybe with a glass of wine or
[1:27:32.840 --> 1:27:36.640]  something like that all of these environmental Sierra Club nature
[1:27:36.640 --> 1:27:39.800]  Conservancy you just name the group they will all tell you at the end of the day
[1:27:39.800 --> 1:27:42.800]  there are too many people on the planet so then I asked the question so what do
[1:27:42.800 --> 1:27:46.120]  you want to do about that well how do you suggest we get rid of the people well
[1:27:46.120 --> 1:27:50.120]  they always say birth control and by that they mean abortion but then I also
[1:27:50.120 --> 1:27:54.920]  asked them well what about a war what about disease would you feel that that
[1:27:54.920 --> 1:27:58.160]  would be a proper way to expunge the planet of all these people and it's
[1:27:58.160 --> 1:28:02.440]  interesting they won't answer that question directly because I believe these
[1:28:02.440 --> 1:28:07.560]  people in a in a strange diabolical way they love disease they love to see
[1:28:07.560 --> 1:28:11.280]  people killed in wars because that's delivering the population that's
[1:28:11.280 --> 1:28:15.000]  reducing the population of the planet that's in State Department random 200
[1:28:15.000 --> 1:28:19.920]  that is their policy absolutely and when you get them to talk honestly they
[1:28:19.920 --> 1:28:23.880]  will articulate that because you could look at Dave Foreman the guy who started
[1:28:23.880 --> 1:28:28.320]  earth first you know it's a radical terrorist eco organization a guy who's
[1:28:28.320 --> 1:28:32.320]  also on the board of the Sierra Club the board of the wilderness society he's
[1:28:32.320 --> 1:28:36.560]  a mainstream environmentalist but he is a radical this is a guy you ask him okay
[1:28:36.560 --> 1:28:40.000]  so how many people should be on planet earth and he will look you right the I
[1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:44.800]  say well probably a hundred million a hundred million so how are we gonna get
[1:28:44.800 --> 1:28:49.200]  to that number without some kind of catastrophe taking place and probably a
[1:28:49.200 --> 1:28:54.040]  designed and planned catastrophe if they were to have it their way what is a
[1:28:54.040 --> 1:28:58.360]  hundred million out of seven billion that we have now that's 95 plus percent
[1:28:58.360 --> 1:29:02.480]  isn't it that's okay that would be you know roughly a third of what we have
[1:29:02.480 --> 1:29:06.640]  here in the United States of America and who are gonna be the survivors Alex
[1:29:06.640 --> 1:29:12.040]  listen this again comes from the bowels of Karl Marx Marx was a materialist Marx
[1:29:12.040 --> 1:29:15.400]  believed that certain people were spit out of their mother's womb with a
[1:29:15.400 --> 1:29:19.080]  better brain than others and those with the better brain have some sort of right
[1:29:19.080 --> 1:29:24.000]  or responsibility to rule over the rest of us because the rest of us left to
[1:29:24.000 --> 1:29:27.920]  our own devices Mark believed would kill one another and destroy the planet
[1:29:27.920 --> 1:29:31.040]  amazing stay there we got to come back with that Brian suspense actually red
[1:29:31.040 --> 1:29:35.840]  marks and Ingalls I have to and linen you should read it all you that think
[1:29:35.840 --> 1:29:40.440]  communism is a quality take so many a George Bernard Shaw he said if you
[1:29:40.440 --> 1:29:44.480]  don't work hard for the state we're gonna kill you it's a bunch of control
[1:29:44.480 --> 1:29:51.640]  freaks ruling you it's total slavery will be back we're on the March the

[1:32:54.640 --> 1:33:09.480]  answer any questions you may have that's www.silverlungs.com waging war on
[1:33:09.480 --> 1:33:18.080]  corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info
[1:33:18.080 --> 1:33:34.640]  war just broke cast Sunstein the White House regulations are that said fine
[1:33:34.640 --> 1:33:39.120]  people he said we could make it illegal to have conspiracy theories but he said
[1:33:39.120 --> 1:33:43.120]  or we could just fine him he wrote that for Harvard and for the Chicago
[1:33:43.120 --> 1:33:49.680]  Business School two different papers he wrote them in 2007 and 2008 and he's a
[1:33:49.680 --> 1:33:54.560]  total tyrant he's an environmental not wacko but tyrant the limbaugh calls them
[1:33:54.560 --> 1:34:00.000]  wackos no these are not wackos yeah I mean crazy like a fox crazy like linen
[1:34:00.000 --> 1:34:05.840]  or Stalin or some other authoritarian so they know what they're doing they're
[1:34:05.840 --> 1:34:09.160]  coming in and taking over society that's what the Jacobins and the French
[1:34:09.160 --> 1:34:13.040]  Revolution took something bad and made it worse and tried to change the work
[1:34:13.040 --> 1:34:19.160]  week to nine days a week you know with like ten months a year they tried to get
[1:34:19.160 --> 1:34:22.440]  rid of the family communism is really old folks
[1:34:22.440 --> 1:34:26.040]  communism it sounds crazy but it's real comes out of the Illuminati
[1:34:26.040 --> 1:34:29.480]  Luciferianism that's even in mainline history books for the average person
[1:34:29.480 --> 1:34:33.120]  here's that goes what but the point is this is what we're facing this is
[1:34:33.120 --> 1:34:37.000]  eco-terrifying and Brian Suspin joins us well I'll give you more details of that
[1:34:37.000 --> 1:34:42.520]  cast Sunstein info here in just a moment we're printing the article off now
[1:34:42.520 --> 1:34:47.760]  and we'll get it up at info wars.com but the book is eco-terrifying in fact all
[1:34:47.760 --> 1:34:51.160]  of his books on this subject are available now via world net daily books
[1:34:51.160 --> 1:34:56.280]  at info wars shop.com and also call our office if you want to inquire about
[1:34:56.280 --> 1:35:02.160]  anything or order over the phone 888-253-3139 and we don't have the
[1:35:02.160 --> 1:35:06.800]  luxury of taking billions of dollars in taxpayer money and giving it to MSNBC
[1:35:06.800 --> 1:35:10.960]  from the banker bailout we actually fund ourselves by you deciding to buy the
[1:35:10.960 --> 1:35:15.560]  high-quality products that we promote here on air you are our sugar daddy folks
[1:35:15.560 --> 1:35:21.360]  you are doing a mid-air refueling for the nightly news the newspaper I'm
[1:35:21.360 --> 1:35:25.600]  coming out with the films the 15 million people we reach a week one way or
[1:35:25.600 --> 1:35:29.200]  another we want to push that to 30 million we want to go to the next level
[1:35:29.200 --> 1:35:33.160]  we want to beat these people because that is about survival I don't want my
[1:35:33.160 --> 1:35:36.680]  three children to be slaves now Brian we got cut off by that break
[1:35:36.680 --> 1:35:43.120]  continuing here where is well you were getting into communist and how they
[1:35:43.120 --> 1:35:47.520]  believe in elitism and that's what they always create is the most top-down most
[1:35:47.520 --> 1:35:52.800]  impoverished because it's designed to do that and then you see the young college
[1:35:52.800 --> 1:35:56.720]  students you know with their doctor parents or their inventor parents
[1:35:56.720 --> 1:36:03.040]  putting them into a $200,000 you know college education wearing Moussey tongue
[1:36:03.040 --> 1:36:07.720]  shirts the trendies here in Austin go to you know communist bars or everywhere
[1:36:07.720 --> 1:36:13.160]  it's really cool to love communism but when I see a red star it's just as
[1:36:13.160 --> 1:36:17.000]  upsetting as a swastika in fact it killed a lot more people than the swastika
[1:36:17.000 --> 1:36:21.680]  you know then the banner of the swastika was used to kill there's no question
[1:36:21.680 --> 1:36:25.680]  about it and again people think it's really cool and hey we can do communism
[1:36:25.680 --> 1:36:30.120]  better but again the bottom line is when you look and study Karl Marx and
[1:36:30.120 --> 1:36:34.320]  Frederick Engels they were they were great wordsmiths they were very deep
[1:36:34.320 --> 1:36:38.560]  thinkers but they were nuts diabolically so and the left today and
[1:36:38.560 --> 1:36:42.480]  those in the hallowed halls of academia and those in the West Wing and then the
[1:36:42.480 --> 1:36:45.720]  Oval Office of the White House think they were the greatest things since sliced
[1:36:45.720 --> 1:36:50.400]  bread I mean a case in point with Marx and Engels as as materialists they
[1:36:50.400 --> 1:36:54.120]  believe that the material in you and me you know the atoms and molecules were no
[1:36:54.120 --> 1:36:57.880]  different than the materials in a redwood tree or a snail the only
[1:36:57.880 --> 1:37:02.960]  difference is those materials the atoms and molecules are just mixed or arranged
[1:37:02.960 --> 1:37:07.400]  differently so therefore we're all the same you know mankind God forbid we
[1:37:07.400 --> 1:37:11.720]  would ever say that mankind is made in the image of God they think that's
[1:37:11.720 --> 1:37:15.560]  absolute foolishness so as a result we're all on an equal plane that's why
[1:37:15.560 --> 1:37:19.560]  they want to protect the other species they say but it's actually beyond that
[1:37:19.560 --> 1:37:23.440]  they don't want to protect the other species they want to discriminate against
[1:37:23.440 --> 1:37:28.520]  humans because they see us as the species that could kill all the rest
[1:37:28.520 --> 1:37:33.520]  therefore we need rules regulations heavy-duty laws to keep us suppressed so
[1:37:33.520 --> 1:37:37.920]  the elite can rise to the top and rule the rest of us now that mindset was
[1:37:37.920 --> 1:37:41.560]  again articulated by Karl Marx and Frederick Engels in so many different
[1:37:41.560 --> 1:37:47.000]  papers and it is believed wholeheartedly by the left in America and the world to
[1:37:47.000 --> 1:37:54.200]  this day continue breaking down well where the environmental fascist are
[1:37:54.200 --> 1:37:58.480]  right now I mean recap for folks that don't remember play-by-play what
[1:37:58.480 --> 1:38:03.240]  happened it the whole climate gate saying how big a defeat that was for them
[1:38:03.240 --> 1:38:06.800]  and then what they're doing since because I know they haven't given up
[1:38:06.800 --> 1:38:10.440]  they've redoubled their efforts they've lost the culture war worldwide all the
[1:38:10.440 --> 1:38:14.040]  polls show it just like with guns they have but they don't care they're just
[1:38:14.040 --> 1:38:18.280]  in fact I've seen them I mean answer my own question hundreds of articles saying
[1:38:18.280 --> 1:38:22.400]  we're authoritarian we want green fascism those are quotes in the Guardian
[1:38:22.400 --> 1:38:26.600]  we're gonna make you at gunpoint we're too stupid to accept their communist
[1:38:26.600 --> 1:38:30.760]  utopia well you keep track of everything so you saw this quote no doubt from
[1:38:30.760 --> 1:38:36.960]  senator John Kerry he said crime climate climate change over the last few years
[1:38:36.960 --> 1:38:41.840]  has regrettably lost credibility in the eyes and ears of the American people so
[1:38:41.840 --> 1:38:47.240]  now he wants to try convince Americans that climate change is as dangerous as
[1:38:47.240 --> 1:38:51.520]  the possibility of war you're right Alex they're totally losing the argument
[1:38:51.520 --> 1:38:55.600]  because people are now using their own brains to look at the fact to realize if
[1:38:55.600 --> 1:38:59.920]  you're gonna have global warming you'd better have global warming now Al Gore
[1:38:59.920 --> 1:39:03.640]  can't disagree with us there's been no global warming whatsoever and I'm
[1:39:03.640 --> 1:39:08.360]  speaking here as a meteorologist since 1998 there's been none in fact over the
[1:39:08.360 --> 1:39:13.520]  last 18 to 24 months the temperature has slightly dropped if you look at all
[1:39:13.520 --> 1:39:18.520]  the warming that's taken taken place since 1950 that would be 0.7 degrees
[1:39:18.520 --> 1:39:22.920]  Celsius just a little over degree Fahrenheit this is a fact they hate
[1:39:22.920 --> 1:39:31.320]  Alex 88% of that warming occurred before 1940 the 1930s hottest decade on record
[1:39:31.320 --> 1:39:36.400]  period can't deny it that's just the way it is 22 of our now 50 states had their
[1:39:36.400 --> 1:39:40.960]  all-time record high temperatures in the 1930s so what do they try to do they
[1:39:40.960 --> 1:39:44.960]  try to scare us with all of these various the latest one at the at the
[1:39:44.960 --> 1:39:48.840]  Rio conference was the extinction of species see it's gone beyond climate
[1:39:48.840 --> 1:39:53.280]  change now they're saying wait mankind's influence and interference on the planet
[1:39:53.280 --> 1:39:57.880]  is going to wipe out all the species they're desperate to win this argument
[1:39:57.880 --> 1:40:02.080]  because as you articulated at the very beginning of this broadcast this is their
[1:40:02.080 --> 1:40:08.520]  hook using the environment to put forward this this brave new world which is
[1:40:08.520 --> 1:40:14.120]  more in keeping with marks than it ever was with Madison and I saw the White
[1:40:14.120 --> 1:40:18.840]  House chef was at a big global meeting last week and said in the future you
[1:40:18.840 --> 1:40:23.280]  won't be allowed to eat even eat regular food we're gonna have big vats that
[1:40:23.280 --> 1:40:27.400]  chemical companies produce and then we will feed you that and then you learn
[1:40:27.400 --> 1:40:31.600]  that brave new world written by Aldous Huxley his brother Julian Huxley was a
[1:40:31.600 --> 1:40:35.640]  eugenicist who founded modern transhumanism and was a huge anti human
[1:40:35.640 --> 1:40:40.520]  environmentalist and that's why Huxley before he died in 62 spoke at Berkeley
[1:40:40.520 --> 1:40:44.560]  and said no this is what we're really planning and that's why we see the top
[1:40:44.560 --> 1:40:48.760]  environmental professors in the last year say we need to cut your food off
[1:40:48.760 --> 1:40:53.560]  engine and have the state genetically engineer you so you eat less to save the
[1:40:53.560 --> 1:40:59.400]  earth I mean it's it's so fantastical until you realize they're really trying
[1:40:59.400 --> 1:41:04.480]  to do it I mean these people are control freak lunatics yeah and again
[1:41:04.480 --> 1:41:09.040]  they're they're not wackos these people are diabolically clever and they're
[1:41:09.040 --> 1:41:13.640]  putting this plant forward and again so good are they that they've been able to
[1:41:13.640 --> 1:41:18.240]  work their way into every facet of government planning at the city level
[1:41:18.240 --> 1:41:22.560]  the county level the state what level and certainly at the at the federal level
[1:41:22.560 --> 1:41:27.920]  and you see this you mentioned for example the smart growth I looked I came
[1:41:27.920 --> 1:41:33.520]  on to this whole smart thing just like you I read all these energy bills 2005
[1:41:33.520 --> 1:41:38.120]  energy bills signed by George W. Bush I saw something in there called direct
[1:41:38.120 --> 1:41:42.440]  response technology and I'm thinking what I've never heard of that before I
[1:41:42.440 --> 1:41:45.760]  thought I knew a lot I don't know what that is so I did my research direct
[1:41:45.760 --> 1:41:50.160]  response technology is the smart meter which is being attached to millions of
[1:41:50.160 --> 1:41:54.920]  houses nationwide the smart meter of course monitors your usage of
[1:41:54.920 --> 1:41:59.000]  electricity minute by minute so that the utility company can charge you now
[1:41:59.000 --> 1:42:04.280]  more during peak periods of usage as they like to say the smart meter will be
[1:42:04.280 --> 1:42:07.760]  connected to the home area network which is under development here in the San
[1:42:07.760 --> 1:42:12.120]  Francisco Bay Area by a number of companies including Google and all of the
[1:42:12.120 --> 1:42:17.840]  new appliances spy on you and tie into it and it's all unified as a global
[1:42:17.840 --> 1:42:22.160]  system they admitted it was to be used to control the temperature when we got mad
[1:42:22.160 --> 1:42:25.520]  they said it was a conspiracy theory now they've taken the old airport in
[1:42:25.520 --> 1:42:29.560]  Austin and are creating a whole community that's like a prison where you
[1:42:29.560 --> 1:42:34.520]  drive in and I'm sorry go ahead it's just they're totally remaking society and
[1:42:34.520 --> 1:42:39.160]  creating artificial environments where we're dependent on them and live in
[1:42:39.160 --> 1:42:44.640]  Panopticon surveillance systems it's like a science fiction nightmare and and
[1:42:44.640 --> 1:42:48.560]  you're right the home area network will be connected to your to your energy star
[1:42:48.560 --> 1:42:54.840]  appliance now folks what Alex just said is absolutely true the energy star
[1:42:54.840 --> 1:42:59.960]  appliances all have the ability to be remotely controlled to be remotely
[1:42:59.960 --> 1:43:03.800]  controlled you know turned off and off by a third party they're all set up that
[1:43:03.800 --> 1:43:08.960]  way so the idea is once the smart grid is in effect which is of course been
[1:43:08.960 --> 1:43:13.920]  funded by the stimulus once that in effect it will have broadband capability
[1:43:13.920 --> 1:43:17.160]  to talk to your house once this is all set up and you'll literally be able to
[1:43:17.160 --> 1:43:21.320]  have some bureaucrat somewhere let's say a hundred a hundred degree day in
[1:43:21.320 --> 1:43:26.080]  Austin when there's supposedly a power shortage this bureaucrats gonna say well
[1:43:26.080 --> 1:43:30.040]  look at Alex this house my gosh he's got a 60 inch big screen watching the ball
[1:43:30.040 --> 1:43:33.600]  game what what is this he's doing a load of laundry in the middle of the
[1:43:33.600 --> 1:43:38.000]  afternoon it's 100 degrees outside okay 60 inch big screen turn it off and
[1:43:38.000 --> 1:43:42.200]  they've said that while they're shutting down our power plants to make sure
[1:43:42.200 --> 1:43:46.360]  there's a shortage and then they admit this is their plan and then we come and
[1:43:46.360 --> 1:43:50.280]  say don't do this take the CIA director two months ago he admitted all the new
[1:43:50.280 --> 1:43:54.840]  appliances have bugs spying on you the cell phones the washing machines the
[1:43:54.840 --> 1:43:59.960]  that now drones everything remote control tracking you listening to you
[1:43:59.960 --> 1:44:06.560]  watching you it makes 1984 look like freedom and again this is all designed
[1:44:06.560 --> 1:44:09.720]  to control us so you know here in California we're going balls to the wall
[1:44:09.720 --> 1:44:14.520]  on this everything that I just described you in terms of the takeover of the
[1:44:14.520 --> 1:44:18.480]  farms take over the ranch is turning it all back to nature hurting us into
[1:44:18.480 --> 1:44:23.160]  urban hubs making us dependent on mass transit having us monitor our carbon
[1:44:23.160 --> 1:44:27.560]  footprint like an idiot would monitor his belly button all of this legislated
[1:44:27.560 --> 1:44:31.560]  in California this is all that this is all legislated we're moving forward and
[1:44:31.560 --> 1:44:36.920]  they've done it in such a way Alex that it's almost virtually impossible to stop
[1:44:36.920 --> 1:44:41.440]  at this point in time because they want California to be the green utopia the
[1:44:41.440 --> 1:44:45.640]  model for the rest of the world that's right it's the command base to bring
[1:44:45.640 --> 1:44:49.840]  down the u.s. economy and then as it implodes they take our tax money and then
[1:44:49.840 --> 1:44:54.040]  the only way you can operate is under them you can't hardly buy appliances
[1:44:54.040 --> 1:44:57.720]  now that don't have all the spy tech in them then of course your wife wants the
[1:44:57.720 --> 1:45:02.360]  newest thing all of it and it's not the technology's bad it's that criminal
[1:45:02.360 --> 1:45:09.000]  backdoors are mandated globally I mean it's just it's just it's so huge and
[1:45:09.000 --> 1:45:14.640]  it's so evil and as you said how do we stop it I mean I'm going to send a
[1:45:14.640 --> 1:45:17.840]  camera crew down there next week here in Austin they've taken over the middle
[1:45:17.840 --> 1:45:22.080]  of the city they're not selling it off to developers or anybody it's a giant
[1:45:22.080 --> 1:45:26.840]  concentration camp where you opt in to live under total surveillance and then
[1:45:26.840 --> 1:45:31.920]  they give you a Chevy Volt paid for and you're the new model I mean it is it's
[1:45:31.920 --> 1:45:36.360]  like a Mars invasion or something yeah and again at the end of the day they're
[1:45:36.360 --> 1:45:41.000]  taking away our choices because they want us to be dependent on them I mean
[1:45:41.000 --> 1:45:45.640]  another crock is the rooftop solar which are being employed all over the United
[1:45:45.640 --> 1:45:49.480]  States through subsidies that people are able to easily get to make it more
[1:45:49.480 --> 1:45:53.440]  affordable to put one of these arrays on your home the biggest misnomer is that
[1:45:53.440 --> 1:45:58.320]  you're suddenly independent of the grid no you're not those solar arrays feed
[1:45:58.320 --> 1:46:02.640]  into the grid if there's a power outage your power goes off just like every
[1:46:02.640 --> 1:46:06.600]  let's be clear they will not give you the incentive to build at your shelf in
[1:46:06.600 --> 1:46:11.840]  many city inspectors will not approve your own system that you must be hooked
[1:46:11.840 --> 1:46:18.120]  into the board absolutely why because they want us to be dependent upon them
[1:46:18.120 --> 1:46:22.680]  and again where is this all coming from I mean they see solar as okay it's it's
[1:46:22.680 --> 1:46:26.320]  a renewable energy source I understand all that I get it I understand that
[1:46:26.320 --> 1:46:31.040]  Albert Einstein won a Nobel Prize for for solar the photovoltaic solar I get
[1:46:31.040 --> 1:46:35.400]  all that but at the end of the day these are people who demonize any company
[1:46:35.400 --> 1:46:40.640]  that dares make a profit off of a natural resource and so that's why they
[1:46:40.640 --> 1:46:45.880]  hate for example coal companies natural gas companies oil companies etc and
[1:46:45.880 --> 1:46:49.440]  that's why they're trying to control solar power which by the way I think
[1:46:49.440 --> 1:46:53.080]  could could be wonderful if the government would just get out of the way
[1:46:53.080 --> 1:46:59.320]  and let solar be controlled by the free market exactly expanding on that all
[1:46:59.320 --> 1:47:02.920]  over the country they're arresting Amish they're arresting people buying their
[1:47:02.920 --> 1:47:06.160]  own milk they're arresting people selling peaches on the side of the highway
[1:47:06.160 --> 1:47:11.480]  they're going after swap meets this is not a joke $15 million federal fines for
[1:47:11.480 --> 1:47:15.400]  a garage sale that sells a recalled product even 10 years later you that's
[1:47:15.400 --> 1:47:18.760]  Fox News you don't believe me look it up folks we put it on screen for people
[1:47:18.760 --> 1:47:22.640]  watching at prisonplanet.tv but radio listeners look it up this is all so off
[1:47:22.640 --> 1:47:26.920]  the charts I know normal people though this can't be true but but it is true
[1:47:26.920 --> 1:47:31.280]  tyranny is always over the top I mean that's the whole point but what about
[1:47:31.280 --> 1:47:36.520]  Oregon 30 days in jail for collecting your own rainwater for a garden they're
[1:47:36.520 --> 1:47:40.360]  now announcing I guess horticulture is illegal all over the country they're
[1:47:40.360 --> 1:47:44.400]  showing up saying I don't care if you have a hundred year old hand dug well
[1:47:44.400 --> 1:47:50.680]  at your farm we are going to put a meter on that I mean this is bondage yeah and
[1:47:50.680 --> 1:47:54.320]  and Alex I mean consider concerning the ranchers and the farmers one of the
[1:47:54.320 --> 1:47:58.960]  things I put in the back of eco tyranny was the document that I know you've seen
[1:47:58.960 --> 1:48:03.240]  I was one of the first guys to find out about this from a friend of mine who
[1:48:03.240 --> 1:48:08.240]  used to work in the interior department to no longer does she saw three pages of
[1:48:08.240 --> 1:48:13.680]  this 21-page document and turned me on to tracking it down in 2010 I found it
[1:48:13.680 --> 1:48:17.440]  this is a plan by Barack Obama's Department of Interior I put it in the
[1:48:17.440 --> 1:48:22.440]  back of the book complete with some masterminds scribblings and notes but
[1:48:22.440 --> 1:48:27.760]  this is a plan to take over 1.6 million acres of land in the United States of
[1:48:27.760 --> 1:48:31.440]  America much of it owned by private individuals buy it with taxpayer money
[1:48:31.440 --> 1:48:36.040]  get rid of the farms on the land get rid of the ranchers on the land and make
[1:48:36.040 --> 1:48:41.160]  this land even inaccessible to just private citizens there they're bragging
[1:48:41.160 --> 1:48:44.320]  about in this document that there will be no visitors centers because they want
[1:48:44.320 --> 1:48:48.440]  this off limits oh no they're already saying you can't swim at public beaches
[1:48:48.440 --> 1:48:52.200]  I went to the USC shore they got a bunch of them but where I've been since I was
[1:48:52.200 --> 1:48:57.040]  a child a few months ago and they and police harassed us and everyone else
[1:48:57.040 --> 1:49:02.280]  there coming up and bossing us about the earth and we just be and they just kept
[1:49:02.280 --> 1:49:07.440]  showing up so many times I finally blew up at them and I mean I mean they they
[1:49:07.440 --> 1:49:12.120]  hate us they hate us I mean they're cult members I would I would have loved
[1:49:12.120 --> 1:49:16.720]  they picked the wrong guy they picked the wrong guy to talk to I would have
[1:49:16.720 --> 1:49:20.760]  been I would have loved to better see that but but Alex it's no laughing
[1:49:20.760 --> 1:49:24.440]  matter I know here in the San Francisco Bay area what they're doing in so many
[1:49:24.440 --> 1:49:29.560]  ways shapes and forms is using private organizations non-governmental organizations
[1:49:29.560 --> 1:49:34.880]  charitable organizations to buy a property they buy a property and then
[1:49:34.880 --> 1:49:39.000]  they get as close as they can to federal land and once they connect to this
[1:49:39.000 --> 1:49:42.680]  private property that they've been able to purchase with federal land then they
[1:49:42.680 --> 1:49:45.800]  can turn it over to the federal government say hey here's a gift for you
[1:49:45.800 --> 1:49:51.280]  federal and then that's used as a tentacle to take over the next land claiming
[1:49:51.280 --> 1:49:54.560]  you're a buffer on it it's just how the communists would take over a country and
[1:49:54.560 --> 1:49:59.120]  then use it in the exploitation phase against the next they operate like a
[1:49:59.120 --> 1:50:03.760]  cancer yes and that's exactly what they've done just as a small example
[1:50:03.760 --> 1:50:07.880]  they're doing this all over the country but it started with Alcatraz Island it
[1:50:07.880 --> 1:50:11.240]  was called the Golden Gate National Recreation Area and then all these all
[1:50:11.240 --> 1:50:15.560]  these green groups started buying up land and in a couple decades they've now
[1:50:15.560 --> 1:50:20.840]  have 60,000 acres of land that they gave to the government it's now called the
[1:50:20.840 --> 1:50:26.960]  Golden Gate National Recreation Area and it's over 60,000 acres in size it's a
[1:50:26.960 --> 1:50:32.280]  there's a 2700 page plan on how to use this property and listen to this hundreds
[1:50:32.280 --> 1:50:37.520]  of pages are dedicated to keeping dogs off the property because the
[1:50:37.520 --> 1:50:44.000]  environmentalists see dogs as an invasive species stay there you live out
[1:50:44.000 --> 1:50:48.040]  there but I've even saw in San Francisco Chronicle five years ago all that land
[1:50:48.040 --> 1:50:52.360]  they took across the Golden Gate it was gonna be a park they don't let regular
[1:50:52.360 --> 1:50:57.040]  people in and all the bureaucrats live there in their own private duchy stay
[1:50:57.040 --> 1:51:00.080]  there but an amazing interview I want to hold him over to the next hour if you
[1:51:00.080 --> 1:51:04.120]  can do it this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying
[1:51:04.120 --> 1:51:08.560]  a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[1:51:08.560 --> 1:51:12.920]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energy czar wants to control how
[1:51:12.920 --> 1:51:17.200]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[1:51:17.200 --> 1:51:21.520]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[1:51:21.520 --> 1:51:25.640]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[1:51:25.640 --> 1:51:30.200]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[1:51:30.200 --> 1:51:34.280]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[1:51:34.280 --> 1:51:38.240]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[1:51:38.240 --> 1:51:42.080]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[1:51:42.080 --> 1:51:44.800]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from

[1:54:06.000 --> 1:54:11.040]  radio network all right I promise to get to your calls with our guests but I've
[1:54:11.040 --> 1:54:15.180]  I've hogged the time so we're gonna keep in 20 minutes the next hour he's been
[1:54:15.180 --> 1:54:18.800]  gracious to do that we're gonna open the phones up starting in like six seven
[1:54:18.800 --> 1:54:22.240]  minutes we start the next hour the toll-free number to join us on this
[1:54:22.240 --> 1:54:30.000]  subject and it's a big one is 800-259-9231 your horror stories I mean I've
[1:54:30.000 --> 1:54:33.480]  seen cases of people having their land taken because a puddle was on it and they
[1:54:33.480 --> 1:54:38.200]  own the land for 50 years I mean these are vicious authoritarians who just need
[1:54:38.200 --> 1:54:43.240]  some excuse as a cover and we're in trouble we may not be able to stop it
[1:54:43.240 --> 1:54:47.280]  because this is organized crime here in Austin and I've done whole shows on it
[1:54:47.280 --> 1:54:52.160]  over the last you know 17 years smart growth they took they they would take
[1:54:52.160 --> 1:54:57.000]  people's 5,000 acre ranches you people that had land forever out in Southwest
[1:54:57.000 --> 1:55:00.400]  Travis they'd say it's gonna be an environmental preserve they take it four
[1:55:00.400 --> 1:55:03.800]  or five years later they take the restrictions off and the city council
[1:55:03.800 --> 1:55:09.520]  people are suddenly basically by special banks given the land and I mean it
[1:55:09.520 --> 1:55:12.800]  is so criminal and then they build shopping malls on it you name it these
[1:55:12.800 --> 1:55:19.880]  are diabolical people okay they are diabolical and then they just use these
[1:55:19.880 --> 1:55:23.680]  mainline communists as the ones that clamor for it but in the final equation
[1:55:23.680 --> 1:55:28.680]  it's really just super sophisticated al Capone's eco-terrany Brian Sussman
[1:55:28.680 --> 1:55:33.720]  everybody should read this book it's available at info warshop.com or you
[1:55:33.720 --> 1:55:39.520]  can call 888-25-33139 to get it also get Rosa Corey's book as you know 21
[1:55:39.520 --> 1:55:43.920]  behind the green mask out to everybody you know and so many city people aren't
[1:55:43.920 --> 1:55:48.640]  criminals but the the hype they get behind it with these non-profit groups
[1:55:48.640 --> 1:55:52.400]  that come in and get behind the politicians that they'll accept it
[1:55:52.400 --> 1:55:55.600]  Brian I want to talk about that before we go to break and take calls we got
[1:55:55.600 --> 1:55:59.800]  about five minutes here from your research as a meteorologist weather guy
[1:55:59.800 --> 1:56:04.000]  guy fighting these guys out in California how do we stop this is
[1:56:04.000 --> 1:56:07.480]  surfdom it's feudalism they're the environmental gods they have rights to
[1:56:07.480 --> 1:56:12.120]  property we don't they make the decision how do we defeat an organized crime
[1:56:12.120 --> 1:56:18.640]  syndicate that operates as a religion it is like a religion Alex there's no
[1:56:18.640 --> 1:56:22.960]  question and by the way the religious element to this started in the United
[1:56:22.960 --> 1:56:27.320]  Nations and Al Gore Al Gore and Mikhail Gorbachev were used by the
[1:56:27.320 --> 1:56:32.640]  environmental by the United Nations in the 80s I should say in the in the
[1:56:32.640 --> 1:56:37.520]  90s video you're right there at their main cult base it's it's amazing I mean
[1:56:37.520 --> 1:56:42.400]  Nancy Pelosi broker to deal for Mikhail Gorbachev he was a communist he is a
[1:56:42.400 --> 1:56:46.920]  communist to get some of the most pristine prestigious most expensive
[1:56:46.920 --> 1:56:51.320]  beautiful real estate in the United States for his quote-unquote green cross
[1:56:51.320 --> 1:56:55.840]  where they started the you in they started the you in there yes and so you
[1:56:55.840 --> 1:56:59.280]  know the whole idea was Mikhail Gorbachev claims to be this big
[1:56:59.280 --> 1:57:03.740]  environmentalist now he's you just like they've been doing since Karl Marx and
[1:57:03.740 --> 1:57:09.480]  Frederick Engels in 1883 they're using environmental crises mostly imagined in
[1:57:09.480 --> 1:57:13.240]  order to put forward their agenda because they feel that that's the best way
[1:57:13.240 --> 1:57:17.280]  to get people to bend to other wishes you know scare them with pollution how do
[1:57:17.280 --> 1:57:23.360]  we beat these how do we beat just flaming criminals it's so tough Alex
[1:57:23.360 --> 1:57:27.280]  because they've been so diabolical the way they've instilled this here in the
[1:57:27.280 --> 1:57:32.240]  San Francisco Bay area oh they're giving us a chance to to voice our concern
[1:57:32.240 --> 1:57:37.880]  regarding agenda 21 being launched in the San Francisco Bay area but in order to
[1:57:37.880 --> 1:57:43.320]  defeat it we would literally have to get every city council to vote against it so
[1:57:43.320 --> 1:57:47.280]  they've been able to spread us out so we're fighting the battles out here but
[1:57:47.280 --> 1:57:50.720]  man we're fighting so many battles at once and they've made it that way on
[1:57:50.720 --> 1:57:57.000]  purpose so other than electing people like Ron Paul and Rand Paul and Tom
[1:57:57.000 --> 1:58:01.800]  McClintock and several others into Congress in order to reverse this thing
[1:58:01.800 --> 1:58:06.840]  I'm just telling you this is a very strong uphill battle we're a rich country
[1:58:06.840 --> 1:58:11.120]  criminals figured out a great scam to take over and people say well why do
[1:58:11.120 --> 1:58:14.680]  they work 40 years to get this they were collecting money from well-meaning
[1:58:14.680 --> 1:58:18.600]  people the whole time building their criminal operations getting old ladies
[1:58:18.600 --> 1:58:23.560]  to sign their land over to them I mean just incredible filth that the criminal
[1:58:23.560 --> 1:58:27.440]  viciousness of these people I mean I keep using that term because they are
[1:58:27.440 --> 1:58:33.000]  vicious mafia trash I mean people talk about Scientology you know you know
[1:58:33.000 --> 1:58:37.240]  being this organized thing folks this is a billion times bigger than that we'll
[1:58:37.240 --> 1:58:39.600]  be right back
[1:58:40.720 --> 1:58:49.120]  you are listening to GCN visit GCN live comm today
[1:58:49.120 --> 1:58:54.960]  the worst drought in 50 years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks
[1:58:54.960 --> 1:58:59.320]  the hottest half year on record 78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought
[1:58:59.320 --> 1:59:03.600]  conditions not only corn but soy alfalfa fruits vegetables and wheat are all
[1:59:03.600 --> 1:59:07.840]  impacted raising prices the cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and
[1:59:07.840 --> 1:59:11.400]  ranchers out of business blowing up your food prices the only strategy to
[1:59:11.400 --> 1:59:15.480]  counter this is to freeze your food cost to today's prices by getting your own
[1:59:15.480 --> 1:59:20.040]  supply of foods for me foods direct now as the price of raw ingredients increases
[1:59:20.040 --> 1:59:23.680]  eat foods will have to raise prices to now is the time to get your supply I
[1:59:23.680 --> 1:59:26.840]  recently increased my supply for me foods direct because we have all known
[1:59:26.840 --> 1:59:30.720]  this was coming you know about their delicious long-term storable foods the
[1:59:30.720 --> 1:59:34.320]  fact is you can eat at any time to save money today and because it stores for
[1:59:34.320 --> 1:59:37.520]  25 years you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food

[2:00:40.600 --> 2:00:44.680]  show host in his own right and former TV weather man and you name it you can
[2:00:44.680 --> 2:00:49.600]  tell that I think maybe someone get I'm sure he's a busy guy get to Brian
[2:00:49.600 --> 2:00:52.800]  Sussman to fill in on the show because we're always looking for great people to
[2:00:52.800 --> 2:00:57.160]  sit in a lot of times I'm here working when I have folks every few weeks sit in
[2:00:57.160 --> 2:01:00.280]  for a day or two just because I'm launching so many new things I'm busy
[2:01:00.280 --> 2:01:04.240]  but I bet Brian is as well I'd like to invite him sometime from San Francisco
[2:01:04.240 --> 2:01:09.880]  where he's based via Skype to host the show Brian Sussman again best-selling
[2:01:09.880 --> 2:01:14.280]  author eco tyranny is the book available at info warshop.com we've been
[2:01:14.280 --> 2:01:17.200]  talking about their criminal takeover and the fact that we've won the battle
[2:01:17.200 --> 2:01:20.600]  intellectually they don't care they're just focusing on brainwashing our kids
[2:01:20.600 --> 2:01:25.160]  let's go to Jenny in Florida you're on the air with our guests go ahead to
[2:01:25.160 --> 2:01:31.240]  Jenny yes hi Alex I've been watching and listening to your show for about a
[2:01:31.240 --> 2:01:36.440]  month founded on Facebook when you had the Dracula photo of Obama and I thought
[2:01:36.440 --> 2:01:43.080]  that was so interesting and my cousin first told me about this new world
[2:01:43.080 --> 2:01:47.840]  order and all this stuff in 2006 and I said you are nuts you're absolutely
[2:01:47.840 --> 2:01:52.160]  nuts because I'm a retired federal officer so I'm like you're nuts you
[2:01:52.160 --> 2:01:55.840]  know you just against the government but no after all the evidence that you've
[2:01:55.840 --> 2:02:00.360]  presented anyway shortly I wanted to get to the point is I don't know if you've
[2:02:00.360 --> 2:02:05.560]  ever heard of the Morris family in Florida but they own the villages in
[2:02:05.560 --> 2:02:11.880]  Florida they owned 33 miles where mother just looked it up of Florida land and
[2:02:11.880 --> 2:02:16.520]  their their their goal is to take over all of Florida for retirees and and have
[2:02:16.520 --> 2:02:20.880]  them live in these little villas these little condos the school you know niche
[2:02:20.880 --> 2:02:25.880]  you know kind of glad you brought that up Bloomberg's wants to follow Germany's
[2:02:25.880 --> 2:02:30.400]  suit Germany's passed the law that by 2020 it's phased in you get tax incentives
[2:02:30.400 --> 2:02:34.880]  or penalized if you don't no more single family homes you must live in these
[2:02:34.880 --> 2:02:40.760]  collectivized homes and I have a UN book from 1980 for US school kids where
[2:02:40.760 --> 2:02:45.160]  they told us in the future we wouldn't live alone but in dormitories let me get
[2:02:45.160 --> 2:02:49.240]  a comment from our guest on that then you come back Jenny in Florida Alex
[2:02:49.240 --> 2:02:56.240]  your spot on this is a UN plan and it was incorporated into agenda 21 in 1992
[2:02:56.240 --> 2:03:01.000]  and reiterated when this last UN conference a few weeks ago but the idea
[2:03:01.000 --> 2:03:06.040]  is to get people certainly out of rural areas return that back to nature get
[2:03:06.040 --> 2:03:11.080]  people out of suburbs and herd them into urban areas concentrating them in
[2:03:11.080 --> 2:03:17.040]  stack-and-pack housing as I like to call it next to urban transportation hubs so
[2:03:17.040 --> 2:03:21.460]  the idea is no more cars no more choices certainly no more houses in the
[2:03:21.460 --> 2:03:25.280]  suburbs and one of the reasons that they'll be able to do this if they
[2:03:25.280 --> 2:03:30.040]  continue is because the price of energy is going to be so out of sight that you
[2:03:30.040 --> 2:03:33.480]  won't be able to afford that's like Obama said he said you can have a cold
[2:03:33.480 --> 2:03:37.920]  plant we're gonna bankrupt you exactly so get you out of the 2,000 square foot
[2:03:37.920 --> 2:03:41.520]  house into a little condo a little hovel will you be able to monitor your
[2:03:41.520 --> 2:03:46.000]  footprint a carbon footprint a little more easily this plan comes right from
[2:03:46.000 --> 2:03:50.240]  the United Nations but it gets better Al Gore will have seven houses some of them
[2:03:50.240 --> 2:03:55.120]  20,000 square feet and all these jets and things and you'll pay him to be able
[2:03:55.120 --> 2:03:59.920]  to use carbon so he can live in giant palaces yeah I think I've written some
[2:03:59.920 --> 2:04:03.640]  of the most damning stuff when I'm going both climb a gate and eco-territy and I
[2:04:03.640 --> 2:04:08.800]  just I get a kick out of this he has one of his beautiful beautiful homes here in
[2:04:08.800 --> 2:04:13.480]  San Francisco and it's interesting because it's located in this area that
[2:04:13.480 --> 2:04:18.280]  he says will become a flood zone so it's incredible Jenny any other points yeah
[2:04:18.280 --> 2:04:22.640]  and as matter of fact the Morris is our very good friends with the Bush family
[2:04:22.640 --> 2:04:28.280]  and to count you know environmentalism and all this stuff they were just
[2:04:28.280 --> 2:04:31.920]  families of theirs I don't know if which more family was involved but they were
[2:04:31.920 --> 2:04:38.840]  just busted hunting big game in Yellowstone you know I want to know
[2:04:38.840 --> 2:04:42.480]  about that particular family I like to look into it but yeah Bush signed on to
[2:04:42.480 --> 2:04:47.560]  all this because it's big business this is big business the big multi-nationals
[2:04:47.560 --> 2:04:51.320]  Goldman Sachs they're bankrolling it because they're gonna make you live
[2:04:51.320 --> 2:04:55.720]  where they want and they own the property it's feudalism it's mafia we'll be

[2:09:13.000 --> 2:09:17.720]  on the air welcome welcome thank you gentlemen comment the question comment
[2:09:17.720 --> 2:09:22.680]  I just finished up an international study tour trip as a part of my UT Dallas
[2:09:22.680 --> 2:09:29.320]  exact MBA program we visited China the apple of David Rockefeller's eye and we
[2:09:29.320 --> 2:09:33.360]  visited a company that was required part of the trip was called digital China you
[2:09:33.360 --> 2:09:37.080]  got to look it up have Paul Watson or his brother look it up or one of your
[2:09:37.080 --> 2:09:41.600]  other great authors this company developed smart cities and one of their
[2:09:41.600 --> 2:09:45.880]  features their new exciting feature that the presenter told us about was that you
[2:09:45.880 --> 2:09:50.280]  had to have all of your food stand if you lived in one of these smart cities
[2:09:50.280 --> 2:09:54.280]  before you put it in the refrigerator or the freezer it had to be barcoded and
[2:09:54.280 --> 2:09:58.160]  stand so that the government knew everything you have in your refrigerator
[2:09:58.160 --> 2:10:02.240]  in your freezer oh no no no no sir sir let me stop you they're building a
[2:10:02.240 --> 2:10:05.640]  smart city in the middle of Austin with federal and globalist money they're
[2:10:05.640 --> 2:10:09.560]  building them in New Mexico Arizona California and these are tentacle
[2:10:09.560 --> 2:10:13.720]  command bases where they bankrupt you and let the first slaves live for free in
[2:10:13.720 --> 2:10:18.160]  them behind barbwire yes then I'm not joking I'm showing photos right now
[2:10:18.160 --> 2:10:23.680]  if you're watching on prisonplanet.tv and they they subsidize others then in
[2:10:23.680 --> 2:10:28.120]  the next ring of the prison while penalizing people that don't enter into
[2:10:28.120 --> 2:10:32.640]  it so it's siege it's economic warfare and they say in the future they already
[2:10:32.640 --> 2:10:36.080]  subsidize old folks who live in these retirement places where they scan
[2:10:36.080 --> 2:10:40.640]  everything in the refrigerator this is the total model of control but you're
[2:10:40.640 --> 2:10:44.000]  saying you were sent there and there they were promoting it when you hear
[2:10:44.000 --> 2:10:49.600]  smart growth think feudalism when you hear smart meter think spy meter slave
[2:10:49.600 --> 2:10:55.240]  meter when they say smart growth or smart meter look out let's get a comment
[2:10:55.240 --> 2:10:59.680]  here from our guest yeah and again everything Alex has said is absolutely
[2:10:59.680 --> 2:11:03.600]  true and I've done a lot of research on the smart meter the home area network
[2:11:03.600 --> 2:11:07.840]  the smart grid us the energy star appliances they're all working together
[2:11:07.840 --> 2:11:13.040]  to monitor every move you make inside of your home and for that matter outside
[2:11:13.040 --> 2:11:17.000]  of your home and another facet of this Alex is of course here in the San
[2:11:17.000 --> 2:11:21.680]  Francisco Bay area there's a plan to make driving and again this is this is a
[2:11:21.680 --> 2:11:26.280]  plan that has been legislated and now they're studying it to put it forward
[2:11:26.280 --> 2:11:30.440]  and into practice to make driving five times more expensive to get us out of
[2:11:30.440 --> 2:11:34.240]  our car in the mass transit and one of the other things that they're really
[2:11:34.240 --> 2:11:39.360]  seriously considering is putting GPS units on our on our vehicles so they
[2:11:39.360 --> 2:11:43.920]  will tax us by the mile but all of that said again if you're going to have
[2:11:43.920 --> 2:11:47.280]  nationalized health care well then don't you think the government of course then
[2:11:47.280 --> 2:11:50.960]  is going to tell you what you should eat that's why they want to monitor every
[2:11:50.960 --> 2:11:54.320]  food stuff that you'll happen oh no it's already started in England they have
[2:11:54.320 --> 2:11:59.120]  ads for computer companies on TV for Germany where all the cars are tracked
[2:11:59.120 --> 2:12:03.280]  intact but also they're scanning where you're going and marking that down with
[2:12:03.280 --> 2:12:07.680]  all the little RFID and that they don't have to dig through your trash can to
[2:12:07.680 --> 2:12:12.000]  give you five thousand three thousand dollar fines like Miami does all of it
[2:12:12.000 --> 2:12:15.920]  is scanned by garbage trucks that drive by making sure you put it all in the
[2:12:15.920 --> 2:12:21.280]  right bend I mean it is a hell level of surveillance yes and again this is the
[2:12:21.280 --> 2:12:24.560]  entire planet it's in the name of saving the environment which is a bunch of
[2:12:24.560 --> 2:12:29.720]  crap it's not about clean air it's not about clean water this is about using
[2:12:29.720 --> 2:12:34.480]  these phony crises to get us under control because again let's just go back
[2:12:34.480 --> 2:12:37.960]  to Karl Marx and Frederick Engels who believe that most of us don't have a
[2:12:37.960 --> 2:12:44.200]  brain capable of regulating our behavior and therefore we need the elites to keep
[2:12:44.200 --> 2:12:49.680]  us under control otherwise we'll go wild kill one another and destroy the planet
[2:12:50.200 --> 2:12:57.000]  meanwhile yeah sorry call it go ahead no the all 43 people I mean these are C
[2:12:57.000 --> 2:13:01.960]  level executives and companies all over the world that go into this program it's
[2:13:01.960 --> 2:13:06.880]  called the global leadership executive MBA and they're all clapping and I asked
[2:13:06.880 --> 2:13:12.560]  a question I said well why does the population of 1.4 million people have
[2:13:12.560 --> 2:13:16.640]  worries about food safety have they ever before I mean the population is
[2:13:16.640 --> 2:13:21.480]  absolutely exploding and I use your your statistic Alex I mean you got a
[2:13:21.480 --> 2:13:26.040]  greater chance of dying of a a bee sting than you do of a terrorist you know
[2:13:26.040 --> 2:13:30.040]  hurting the food supply and they all laughed at me they're all you know
[2:13:30.040 --> 2:13:34.440]  that's ridiculous oh no no it's a total cult because they know they're there to
[2:13:34.440 --> 2:13:39.040]  show they're gonna clap to be minions in the new tyrannical hell system with a
[2:13:39.040 --> 2:13:43.920]  control freaks as the CIA director bragged watching you through all your
[2:13:43.920 --> 2:13:48.480]  appliances and controlling it and then when you don't feed your kids right they
[2:13:48.480 --> 2:13:50.920]  say they're gonna come take your kids from you I mean these people are
[2:13:50.920 --> 2:13:56.520]  unbelievable animals yeah and the other part is Alex you talked about the other
[2:13:56.520 --> 2:14:00.120]  day and I know you've never ever ever called for violence there's never been a
[2:14:00.120 --> 2:14:04.800]  greater advocate of the information war as a way to beat these people but I mean
[2:14:04.800 --> 2:14:10.640]  at what point does a warrior poet even George Washington or Thomas Jefferson
[2:14:10.640 --> 2:14:14.880]  say okay now it's time to defend ourselves I mean if well here's the deal
[2:14:14.880 --> 2:14:18.080]  here's the deal they staged Oklahoma City and other events to blame it on
[2:14:18.080 --> 2:14:21.920]  libertarians and conservatives because they want to make us morally the bad
[2:14:21.920 --> 2:14:27.120]  guys okay they so so what we have to understand is we're having a better
[2:14:27.120 --> 2:14:32.040]  effect waking people up we're winning the culture war now they're accelerating
[2:14:32.040 --> 2:14:36.400]  things acting even crazier we have a chance of beating them I'm not going to
[2:14:36.400 --> 2:14:40.800]  a FEMA camp which they now admit I'm not that they've set up I'm not going to
[2:14:40.800 --> 2:14:45.240]  one of their reeducation centers nobody's forcibly inoculating my children
[2:14:45.240 --> 2:14:51.440]  but that's a defensive let's get Brian assessments take on that question well
[2:14:51.440 --> 2:14:56.080]  offensively some of the things we could do if we would just have some people who
[2:14:56.080 --> 2:14:59.880]  are constitutionally motivated in the Congress and there are some as you know
[2:14:59.880 --> 2:15:04.560]  Alex but not enough we need to dismantle the Department of Interior this is one
[2:15:04.560 --> 2:15:08.600]  of the things I talk about extensively in eco-tyranny we don't need national
[2:15:08.600 --> 2:15:12.520]  parks the founders never wanted us to have national parks let's give those
[2:15:12.520 --> 2:15:17.160]  national parks those national wetlands those national marine sanctuaries let's
[2:15:17.160 --> 2:15:21.400]  give those back to the states they could probably make them cash positive
[2:15:21.400 --> 2:15:26.000]  endeavors and then they can decide what to do with the land the resources etc
[2:15:26.000 --> 2:15:29.800]  that's one thing we should do the other thing that's so obvious is shut down the
[2:15:29.800 --> 2:15:35.120]  EPA every state has their own EPA ours in California makes the federal EPA look
[2:15:35.120 --> 2:15:39.160]  like a bunch of pikers we don't need the EPA so those are some of the things we
[2:15:39.160 --> 2:15:43.920]  could begin doing right now to bring some sanity and constitutional morality
[2:15:43.920 --> 2:15:48.120]  back to the equation and by the way it was David Rockefeller that financed the
[2:15:48.120 --> 2:15:53.400]  entire national park program to create the modern environmental movement it was
[2:15:53.400 --> 2:15:58.440]  about keeping people from going out west and getting their own land it was
[2:15:58.440 --> 2:16:02.160]  basically about them gobbling it up and controlling it and now they've used those
[2:16:02.160 --> 2:16:08.280]  under the biospheres and other systems to grab land outside the parks absolutely
[2:16:08.280 --> 2:16:12.400]  I mean you look at Rockefeller's doctoral thesis and it was about these
[2:16:12.400 --> 2:16:16.280]  very issues so it's nothing that was hidden but again it's all about the
[2:16:16.280 --> 2:16:21.320]  information Alex as you know if you take the time to dig up the data you will
[2:16:21.320 --> 2:16:27.360]  see that this has been in the in the oven of bad ideas for a long time let's go
[2:16:27.360 --> 2:16:33.320]  another caller here quickly let's talk to Mark listening on KO my 1340 a.m. and
[2:16:33.320 --> 2:16:38.760]  Santa Cruz, California you're on the air with our guest yes sir there are people
[2:16:38.760 --> 2:16:43.520]  going door-to-door knocking on doors of people they don't know saying tune in to
[2:16:43.520 --> 2:16:49.200]  KO my 1340 right now and you know I sure hope that Brian Sussman will sit in for
[2:16:49.200 --> 2:16:54.600]  you Alex I think he would make a great substitute I would like to say that Dr.
[2:16:54.600 --> 2:16:59.200]  Sam Keane during the Gorbachev World Summit conference a few years ago there
[2:16:59.200 --> 2:17:04.800]  and in a Brian's land there in San Francisco got a standing ovation when
[2:17:04.800 --> 2:17:11.840]  he said we need to kill 90% of the world's population eliminate 90% of the
[2:17:11.840 --> 2:17:16.320]  world's population and if you think I'm lying Dr. Stan Brian Sussman's good
[2:17:16.320 --> 2:17:21.080]  friend on radio liberty.com has the speech it's not a lie these people mean
[2:17:21.080 --> 2:17:26.800]  business they mean business and I want us to of many of you to buy climate
[2:17:26.800 --> 2:17:32.120]  gate through info wars.com and made Brian Sussman sell a million copies and
[2:17:32.120 --> 2:17:36.200]  keep up the good work guys absolutely I mean the reason I start hyperventilating
[2:17:36.200 --> 2:17:41.080]  sometimes and and talking fast because as a normal person with family these are
[2:17:41.080 --> 2:17:45.380]  criminals these are scary people who who all talk about how they want to reduce
[2:17:45.380 --> 2:17:49.280]  this down to a hundred million or less that's a 90 plus reduction in world
[2:17:49.280 --> 2:17:53.760]  population they want to not let Africa get power plants they I mean these are
[2:17:53.760 --> 2:17:59.000]  horrible people they're they're not misguided liberals they're monsters Alex
[2:17:59.000 --> 2:18:03.920]  I have a friend and I speak of him in both of my books this is a guy who is
[2:18:03.920 --> 2:18:09.960]  he he's actually a partner with Al Gore at one of the venture capital firms in
[2:18:09.960 --> 2:18:13.880]  the Silicon Valley this is a if you and I were to sit down with this guy he would
[2:18:13.880 --> 2:18:16.520]  be like our brother but he's a businessman he's a partner in this
[2:18:16.520 --> 2:18:22.040]  firm where Al Gore was brought in as a partner as well this guy has spoken to
[2:18:22.040 --> 2:18:26.320]  individuals who have actually attended the Bilderberger meetings these are
[2:18:26.320 --> 2:18:29.360]  other you know highfalutin venture capitalists and he's talked to them
[2:18:29.360 --> 2:18:32.600]  about their you know Bilderberger plans you know I have a couple drinks start
[2:18:32.600 --> 2:18:37.400]  talking and these guys will tell you one of the reasons why they're invested in
[2:18:37.400 --> 2:18:41.520]  the green movement is because they see this as a green bubble like the internet
[2:18:41.520 --> 2:18:46.680]  bubble a green bubble and they also see the entire global economy perhaps
[2:18:46.680 --> 2:18:52.640]  collapsing and this may be their last shot at making big big bucks now if
[2:18:52.640 --> 2:18:57.480]  that's the case that's why you have Al Gore and his his elk out there hyping
[2:18:57.480 --> 2:19:00.840]  global warming because without global warming without climate change without
[2:19:00.840 --> 2:19:05.880]  ecological disaster they don't have a chance to make all of this big money
[2:19:05.880 --> 2:19:09.720]  which some of them will admit may be their last opportunity of lifetime to
[2:19:09.720 --> 2:19:13.560]  score listen if you've got to go Brian that's fine I'd like to do one more
[2:19:13.560 --> 2:19:17.800]  segment here so we can talk to Dan listing on XM 166 and a few others can
[2:19:17.800 --> 2:19:21.040]  you do it let's do it okay great we're gonna go to break come back in a little
[2:19:21.040 --> 2:19:24.120]  six-minute segment then I promise I'll get to all this other news after Brian
[2:19:24.120 --> 2:19:29.880]  leaves us but it makes me so angry that we've got real environmental issues real
[2:19:29.880 --> 2:19:34.400]  problems to face and they are just brainwashing people in the public
[2:19:34.400 --> 2:19:38.640]  schools they are brainwashing them everywhere and they are I live in Austin
[2:19:38.640 --> 2:19:43.280]  where my family and where my mom is from I mean where I've got family going back
[2:19:43.280 --> 2:19:47.840]  to you know the Alamo here in central Texas this is where I live I love Austin
[2:19:47.840 --> 2:19:53.680]  most people here are constitutionalist but you've got a tiny click of crooks
[2:19:53.680 --> 2:19:58.400]  that run my town and they are just stealing everything and I want to beat
[2:19:58.400 --> 2:20:04.360]  these people the worst drought in 50 years continues and the first six months
[2:20:04.360 --> 2:20:09.200]  of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record 78% of the Midwest corn belt is
[2:20:09.200 --> 2:20:13.480]  in drought conditions not only corn but soy alfalfa fruits vegetables and wheat
[2:20:13.480 --> 2:20:17.960]  are all impacted raising prices the cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers

[2:20:21.680 --> 2:20:25.760]  counter this is to freeze your food cost to today's prices by getting your own

[2:23:09.920 --> 2:23:13.800]  Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time
[2:23:13.800 --> 2:23:18.280]  when only the president could obtain this world-class healer now 27 years

[2:23:58.760 --> 2:24:09.480]  got during the break with calculators were public school educated so it took a
[2:24:09.480 --> 2:24:13.760]  while we did the math there's a little over 7 million people in the world and
[2:24:13.760 --> 2:24:19.480]  most globalists say reduce this by 90% the liberals go no only kill 80% by
[2:24:19.480 --> 2:24:26.600]  wars cutting off food whatever but it's 1.43% so they want to reduce the
[2:24:26.600 --> 2:24:30.960]  population from 7 million to 100 million because the US population only 4% of the
[2:24:30.960 --> 2:24:37.600]  world were 310 million it's 1.43 so they want to reduce the world population by
[2:24:37.600 --> 2:24:43.120]  over 98% if they want to reduce this down to 100 million as some of them say
[2:24:43.120 --> 2:24:47.960]  and because they have this idea they will all then be theirs and they're
[2:24:47.960 --> 2:24:50.800]  going to have the live extension technologies and the rest of it they
[2:24:50.800 --> 2:24:53.880]  don't want you to have that this is what they say they want the future for
[2:24:53.880 --> 2:24:58.760]  themselves they are the most vicious selfish pig like people on earth and
[2:24:58.760 --> 2:25:03.120]  they're running around lecturing us and the CIA's bragging they're wiring our
[2:25:03.120 --> 2:25:06.720]  houses with a spy on us I mean these people are the ultimate threat it's
[2:25:06.720 --> 2:25:10.960]  basically like body snatchers took over or something okay I mean I mean I mean
[2:25:10.960 --> 2:25:14.960]  we're so late in the game here these people are vicious scum you cannot hate
[2:25:14.960 --> 2:25:18.480]  them enough I'm just gonna be honest with you I mean it just weren't a
[2:25:18.480 --> 2:25:21.920]  desperate situation I'm sorry I'm ranting but there's just gotta be some
[2:25:21.920 --> 2:25:26.920]  way out of this with these monsters Dan listing on XM 166 you're on the year
[2:25:26.920 --> 2:25:33.040]  with best-selling author Brian Sussman of Eco Terany go ahead Alex this is P.I. Dan
[2:25:33.040 --> 2:25:38.160]  your Bilderberg videographer oh yeah buddy how you doing real good sir I
[2:25:38.160 --> 2:25:42.440]  had an epiphany I remember the conversation I had with my dad when I
[2:25:42.440 --> 2:25:47.520]  was like 10 years old and he was talking about how a quote from the key to
[2:25:47.520 --> 2:25:53.240]  Bruce Jeff it's eight-cent or four sentences long says we will take
[2:25:53.240 --> 2:25:58.600]  America without firing your shot we will bury you we can't expect American
[2:25:58.600 --> 2:26:03.640]  people to jump from capitalism to communism but we can't assist their
[2:26:03.640 --> 2:26:09.360]  elected leaders in giving them small doses of socialism until they awaken
[2:26:09.360 --> 2:26:14.720]  one day to find that we have they have communism we do not have to invade the
[2:26:14.720 --> 2:26:19.680]  United States we will destroy it from within that's because the same bankers
[2:26:19.680 --> 2:26:23.960]  the Rockefellers set them up I mean that's why this is because you read an
[2:26:23.960 --> 2:26:27.360]  undare call a conspiracy that incidentally we sell it info or shop.com
[2:26:27.360 --> 2:26:32.520]  that woke myself up and you know helped the light bulb come on for Brian it
[2:26:32.520 --> 2:26:38.000]  explains there's an ultra rich group who who hates middle-class and and
[2:26:38.000 --> 2:26:42.600]  independent wealthy I appreciate your call sir you want to comment on that well
[2:26:42.600 --> 2:26:47.200]  yeah and getting back to this population control because Alex it all ties in you
[2:26:47.200 --> 2:26:50.400]  know you have Hillary Clinton at the UN's International Conference on
[2:26:50.400 --> 2:26:54.320]  Population and Development talking about the launch of a new program in the
[2:26:54.320 --> 2:26:57.920]  United States that will be the centerpiece of foreign policy that new
[2:26:57.920 --> 2:27:02.480]  program was sixty three billion dollars to go to the third world to reduce
[2:27:02.480 --> 2:27:06.600]  population how are they reducing population well it's not by handing out
[2:27:06.600 --> 2:27:12.480]  commons condoms it's by sterilization and abortion at sixty three billion
[2:27:12.480 --> 2:27:16.960]  dollars of our money for this particular UN population plan that's a that is a
[2:27:16.960 --> 2:27:20.640]  crime and Bill and Melinda Gates are helping finance abortion and again all
[2:27:20.640 --> 2:27:24.240]  these yuppies they'll tell you okay I'm not really a liberal I do want to kill
[2:27:24.240 --> 2:27:28.360]  these brown people and I say to those racist because they hate blacks and
[2:27:28.360 --> 2:27:33.880]  Hispanics and Asians so much they dress as hippies to you know I mean as a cover
[2:27:33.880 --> 2:27:36.720]  I mean you know I'm you I mean you live around there in San Francisco they'll
[2:27:36.720 --> 2:27:39.040]  tell you there I mean it was like Margaret Sanger said I want to kill
[2:27:39.040 --> 2:27:42.560]  these blacks so bad we're gonna pose as liberals you can read her papers she's
[2:27:42.560 --> 2:27:47.120]  gonna kill these weeds they know what they're doing I forget the point I was
[2:27:47.120 --> 2:27:52.520]  gonna make they're just so incredibly vicious yes they are and Alex I mean
[2:27:52.520 --> 2:27:56.200]  getting back to the color of skin look at the African continents look at for
[2:27:56.200 --> 2:28:02.440]  example how how we're not we we decided that we weren't going to fight malaria
[2:28:02.440 --> 2:28:06.960]  with a compound that was known to work every time it was employed and so we
[2:28:06.960 --> 2:28:11.080]  have millions of people dying of malaria we have disease on the African
[2:28:11.080 --> 2:28:15.440]  continent the likes of which is just unimaginable and yet these liberals these
[2:28:15.440 --> 2:28:19.240]  elites stand by and let it happen but God forbid that we would ever have
[2:28:19.240 --> 2:28:23.560]  infrastructure for clean water and infrastructure for sewers and infrastructure
[2:28:23.560 --> 2:28:27.920]  for power and electricity down there because they don't want to they say they
[2:28:27.920 --> 2:28:31.040]  don't want to mess with that pristine environment listen this in and of
[2:28:31.040 --> 2:28:37.000]  itself is population control of the African continent you're absolutely
[2:28:37.000 --> 2:28:40.560]  right and the point I was you know about to get to is that when you look at the
[2:28:40.560 --> 2:28:47.240]  numbers and just how diabolical all of this is just their carbon taxes alone
[2:28:47.240 --> 2:28:50.480]  Lord Moncton estimated would kill a billion people over the next decade and
[2:28:50.480 --> 2:28:55.640]  if you industrialize these people would actually have less children it's just so
[2:28:55.640 --> 2:29:01.160]  cold-blooded what they're doing and they're just running absolutely rampant
[2:29:01.160 --> 2:29:04.880]  and I try to tell the hippies and the yuppies hey dummy they're doing it to
[2:29:04.880 --> 2:29:09.760]  you too absolutely absolutely they're doing this is the these are equal
[2:29:09.760 --> 2:29:15.480]  opportunity destroyals destroyers they will use any P on they can to front
[2:29:15.480 --> 2:29:19.360]  their product but it's interesting when you talk to people I mean I talked to
[2:29:19.360 --> 2:29:22.920]  these kids out there where there are clipboards from Greenpeace and the Sierra
[2:29:22.920 --> 2:29:27.240]  Club of the Nature Conservancy and I'll start talking to them about liberty and
[2:29:27.240 --> 2:29:31.320]  I'll talk to them about freedom and their eyes begin to open a little bit when I
[2:29:31.320 --> 2:29:36.600]  show them that what they're fronting is antithetical to liberty and freedom
[2:29:36.600 --> 2:29:40.480]  their eyes start to open just a little bit and that's what we need to keep
[2:29:40.480 --> 2:29:44.840]  absolutely Brian we got to get you back up very soon God bless you the books
[2:29:44.840 --> 2:29:48.840]  available at info warshop.com thank you so much sir amazing we'll be right back
[2:29:48.840 --> 2:29:54.960]  with the news today with us we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones
[2:29:54.960 --> 2:29:59.120]  and the GCN radio network
[2:30:00.280 --> 2:30:05.080]  the worst drought in 50 years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks
[2:30:05.080 --> 2:30:09.400]  the hottest half year on record 78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought
[2:30:09.400 --> 2:30:13.680]  conditions not only corn but soy alfalfa fruits vegetables and wheat are all
[2:30:13.680 --> 2:30:17.960]  impacted raising prices the cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and
[2:30:17.960 --> 2:30:21.480]  ranchers out of business blowing up your food prices the only strategy to
[2:30:21.480 --> 2:30:25.600]  counter this is to freeze your food cost in today's prices by getting your own
[2:30:25.600 --> 2:30:30.120]  supply of foods from e-foods direct now as the price of raw ingredients increases
[2:30:30.120 --> 2:30:33.800]  e-foods will have to raise prices too now is the time to get your supply I
[2:30:33.800 --> 2:30:37.240]  recently increased my supply from e-foods direct because we've all known this
[2:30:37.240 --> 2:30:41.080]  was coming you know about their delicious long-term storeable foods the fact
[2:30:41.080 --> 2:30:44.800]  is you can eat at any time to save money today and because it's stored for 25
[2:30:44.800 --> 2:30:48.280]  years they're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost don't
[2:30:48.280 --> 2:30:54.160]  wait call 800 409 563 or go to e-foods direct comm forward slash Alex call

[2:30:59.320 --> 2:31:03.560]  on e-foods direct this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider
[2:31:03.560 --> 2:31:07.800]  buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[2:31:07.800 --> 2:31:12.120]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to
[2:31:12.120 --> 2:31:15.920]  control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[2:31:15.920 --> 2:31:19.560]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[2:31:19.560 --> 2:31:24.120]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[2:31:24.120 --> 2:31:28.160]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[2:31:28.160 --> 2:31:31.960]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[2:31:31.960 --> 2:31:35.560]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[2:31:35.560 --> 2:31:39.920]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[2:31:39.920 --> 2:31:43.040]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[2:31:43.040 --> 2:31:46.720]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you

[2:32:05.480 --> 2:32:10.200]  generator now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the
[2:32:10.200 --> 2:32:14.120]  solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the
[2:32:14.120 --> 2:32:17.980]  lungs the respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne
[2:32:17.980 --> 2:32:22.960]  pathogens and viruses the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system
[2:32:22.960 --> 2:32:28.200]  with your self-produced nano silver solutions and also delivers the silver
[2:32:28.200 --> 2:32:32.840]  nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream with continued legislation
[2:32:32.840 --> 2:32:37.080]  threatening the sale of nano silver products you can now produce pure and
[2:32:37.080 --> 2:32:41.840]  endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator very easy to follow

[2:34:29.560 --> 2:34:32.560]  she'll turn on a power
[2:34:32.560 --> 2:34:34.560]  yeah

[2:34:50.560 --> 2:34:53.560]  the head of Homeland Security I mean Miss Napolitana
[2:34:53.560 --> 2:34:55.560]  looks the kill not in a good way
[2:34:55.560 --> 2:34:57.560]  just being mean I'm sorry

[2:34:59.560 --> 2:35:02.560]  they're a bunch of murdering globalist scum
[2:35:02.560 --> 2:35:04.560]  pushing total tyranny
[2:35:04.560 --> 2:35:06.560]  destroying our national sovereignty
[2:35:06.560 --> 2:35:08.560]  legalizing the illegal aliens
[2:35:08.560 --> 2:35:10.560]  engaging every crime you can imagine
[2:35:10.560 --> 2:35:12.560]  funding Al Qaeda openly
[2:35:12.560 --> 2:35:14.560]  and I personally am sick of them
[2:35:14.560 --> 2:35:17.560]  alright I promise to go to your phone calls
[2:35:17.560 --> 2:35:20.560]  so I'm gonna take five of them here
[2:35:20.560 --> 2:35:22.560]  Ralph's just called in, but he disagrees
[2:35:22.560 --> 2:35:24.560]  so I'll put them ahead of the line
[2:35:24.560 --> 2:35:27.560]  and then we'll go to Eric, Mike, Brian and John
[2:35:27.560 --> 2:35:30.560]  but I gotta move quick because I've got to get more into the military news
[2:35:30.560 --> 2:35:34.560]  and some other important cutlets of information here today
[2:35:34.560 --> 2:35:36.560]  I'm gonna shoot some special reports after the show
[2:35:36.560 --> 2:35:39.560]  that are gonna air Monday when Mike Adams sits in here
[2:35:39.560 --> 2:35:41.560]  but there will be a special report Monday
[2:35:41.560 --> 2:35:43.560]  that Aaron and I are gonna put together
[2:35:43.560 --> 2:35:45.560]  dealing with the nature of the globalist
[2:35:45.560 --> 2:35:47.560]  this is gonna be very very important
[2:35:47.560 --> 2:35:52.560]  alright now let's talk to Ralph Lauren from Michigan
[2:35:52.560 --> 2:35:55.560]  come on down you disagree go ahead sir
[2:35:55.560 --> 2:35:59.560]  yes Alex I'm calling to correct a meaningful error
[2:35:59.560 --> 2:36:01.560]  of fact that I hear on your program from time to time
[2:36:01.560 --> 2:36:04.560]  concerning the origins of federal income tax Alex
[2:36:04.560 --> 2:36:06.560]  I've heard it said that we got the income tax
[2:36:06.560 --> 2:36:09.560]  with the 16th Amendment or we got the income tax
[2:36:09.560 --> 2:36:12.560]  with the Federal Reserve Act and these are both incorrect Alex
[2:36:12.560 --> 2:36:16.560]  we got the income tax in 1862
[2:36:16.560 --> 2:36:19.560]  with the Revenue Act of 1862 Alex
[2:36:19.560 --> 2:36:23.560]  and that tax was an excise tax Alex
[2:36:23.560 --> 2:36:26.560]  and an excise tax is an indirect tax
[2:36:26.560 --> 2:36:28.560]  it's not a direct tax
[2:36:28.560 --> 2:36:30.560]  and if you've got to move quick here Alex
[2:36:30.560 --> 2:36:32.560]  I'll move as quick as I can here
[2:36:32.560 --> 2:36:34.560]  because let me first give credit to the book
[2:36:34.560 --> 2:36:37.560]  that is responsible for my education on this
[2:36:37.560 --> 2:36:39.560]  oh is that the book he wrote?
[2:36:39.560 --> 2:36:40.560]  excuse me sir
[2:36:40.560 --> 2:36:42.560]  is that the book he wrote?
[2:36:42.560 --> 2:36:46.560]  I didn't write a book no but I'm gonna tell you about the book
[2:36:46.560 --> 2:36:48.560]  oh you're pausing on that authority deal
[2:36:48.560 --> 2:36:50.560]  I'm done with you I appreciate your call
[2:36:50.560 --> 2:36:53.560]  listen I don't mind somebody calling up to correct me
[2:36:53.560 --> 2:36:55.560]  or whatever and I'll look into that but just
[2:36:55.560 --> 2:36:57.560]  hey that's good just go do it
[2:36:57.560 --> 2:36:59.560]  I mean that's great bud I'm bad you're good
[2:36:59.560 --> 2:37:01.560]  everything you know we got the story
[2:37:01.560 --> 2:37:04.560]  you can send me an email about the book if you want me to look it up
[2:37:04.560 --> 2:37:06.560]  I just you know
[2:37:06.560 --> 2:37:09.560]  the Federal Reserve
[2:37:09.560 --> 2:37:13.560]  came in in 1913 and they passed the 16th Amendment
[2:37:13.560 --> 2:37:15.560]  and I've interviewed all the scholars
[2:37:15.560 --> 2:37:18.560]  who went like Bill Benson and Red Beckman
[2:37:18.560 --> 2:37:21.560]  I mean the founder of the fully informed jury movement
[2:37:21.560 --> 2:37:24.560]  you name it all the lawyers all the congress people
[2:37:24.560 --> 2:37:29.560]  all of it we got what you know of as this income tax
[2:37:29.560 --> 2:37:33.560]  this progressive income tax the same year to pay the Federal Reserve
[2:37:33.560 --> 2:37:35.560]  and that's in the Communist Manifesto
[2:37:35.560 --> 2:37:38.560]  that's in the Communist Manifesto you get a central bank
[2:37:38.560 --> 2:37:40.560]  and then get an income tax to finance it
[2:37:40.560 --> 2:37:43.560]  and they had the Ronald Reagan's Commission
[2:37:43.560 --> 2:37:45.560]  back in 81 was it called the Reese Commission
[2:37:45.560 --> 2:37:48.560]  or the Grace Commission I had a original copy of it out there
[2:37:48.560 --> 2:37:50.560]  in my stack we just cleaned off the table
[2:37:50.560 --> 2:37:52.560]  I was covered about a month ago
[2:37:52.560 --> 2:37:54.560]  and I just it's like it's not true
[2:37:54.560 --> 2:37:58.560]  the income tax is unconstitutional
[2:37:58.560 --> 2:38:02.560]  it's been proven to be it wasn't even ratified by the states
[2:38:02.560 --> 2:38:05.560]  that's been proven and it's the Federal Reserve
[2:38:05.560 --> 2:38:07.560]  you pay the money to
[2:38:07.560 --> 2:38:09.560]  and so yeah they had some other taxes
[2:38:09.560 --> 2:38:12.560]  that all people argue with are unconstitutional
[2:38:12.560 --> 2:38:14.560]  and I'll look up that particular one
[2:38:14.560 --> 2:38:18.560]  but I mean that was just like just the venom of it all
[2:38:18.560 --> 2:38:20.560]  it's just bizarre
[2:38:20.560 --> 2:38:23.560]  I mean I can pick up a lot from a voice
[2:38:23.560 --> 2:38:25.560]  but just very strange
[2:38:25.560 --> 2:38:27.560]  you want to do those pregnant pauses bye bye
[2:38:27.560 --> 2:38:29.560]  you know what I mean play games
[2:38:29.560 --> 2:38:31.560]  I mean I put you up front
[2:38:31.560 --> 2:38:33.560]  but I just weird little games that people do
[2:38:33.560 --> 2:38:35.560]  I just can't do it
[2:38:35.560 --> 2:38:39.560]  let's go ahead and talk to
[2:38:39.560 --> 2:38:42.560]  Eric in Canada you're on the air welcome
[2:38:42.560 --> 2:38:45.560]  oh hi Alex nice to talk to you again
[2:38:45.560 --> 2:38:46.560]  good thank you
[2:38:46.560 --> 2:38:49.560]  I had an idea you were asking like what can we do
[2:38:49.560 --> 2:38:51.560]  and that's just
[2:38:51.560 --> 2:38:53.560]  but it occurred to me
[2:38:53.560 --> 2:38:56.560]  well since the government is openly more or less
[2:38:56.560 --> 2:38:59.560]  corporatistic and fascistic
[2:38:59.560 --> 2:39:02.560]  like maybe we should get like a citizens union going
[2:39:02.560 --> 2:39:04.560]  or something you know
[2:39:04.560 --> 2:39:06.560]  yeah I agree with you but they infiltrate those
[2:39:06.560 --> 2:39:08.560]  and call them terrorists
[2:39:08.560 --> 2:39:09.560]  but you still got to go ahead and do it
[2:39:09.560 --> 2:39:10.560]  it's anybody that calls for violence
[2:39:10.560 --> 2:39:13.560]  you know is an operative or misguided
[2:39:13.560 --> 2:39:14.560]  but we've all got to do something
[2:39:14.560 --> 2:39:16.560]  I mean I think the main thing is
[2:39:16.560 --> 2:39:18.560]  they can't get away with this without moral authority
[2:39:18.560 --> 2:39:20.560]  so just every way you can
[2:39:20.560 --> 2:39:22.560]  whether it's banner hangs or YouTube videos
[2:39:22.560 --> 2:39:24.560]  or Facebook post
[2:39:24.560 --> 2:39:27.560]  or everybody just hammer the enemy
[2:39:27.560 --> 2:39:30.560]  and that's how we're going to defeat them
[2:39:30.560 --> 2:39:32.560]  and expose the private Federal Reserve
[2:39:32.560 --> 2:39:35.560]  and expose that they have similar systems
[2:39:35.560 --> 2:39:37.560]  in every other country they control
[2:39:37.560 --> 2:39:38.560]  first thing they did when they took over Baghdad
[2:39:38.560 --> 2:39:39.560]  was put in a central bank
[2:39:39.560 --> 2:39:41.560]  and start all that manipulation
[2:39:41.560 --> 2:39:43.560]  these bankers take control
[2:39:43.560 --> 2:39:45.560]  because they control the fiat
[2:39:45.560 --> 2:39:47.560]  issuance of currency and credit
[2:39:47.560 --> 2:39:49.560]  and now we live and die by them
[2:39:49.560 --> 2:39:51.560]  in this global government
[2:39:51.560 --> 2:39:54.560]  yeah but you know if someone like yourself
[2:39:54.560 --> 2:39:57.560]  or maybe Jesse Ventura would head up something like this
[2:39:57.560 --> 2:40:00.560]  someone you know that
[2:40:00.560 --> 2:40:03.560]  that's trustworthy you know
[2:40:03.560 --> 2:40:05.560]  well I mean Ron Paul's done a lot of good
[2:40:05.560 --> 2:40:06.560]  identifying the problems
[2:40:06.560 --> 2:40:09.560]  we can debate the solutions all day
[2:40:09.560 --> 2:40:11.560]  and Ron Paul overall is doing a good job
[2:40:11.560 --> 2:40:13.560]  but I mean I'm sure
[2:40:13.560 --> 2:40:15.560]  I mean we can come out with basic ideas
[2:40:15.560 --> 2:40:18.560]  and you know a manifesto against their tyranny
[2:40:18.560 --> 2:40:21.560]  but I'm just busy
[2:40:21.560 --> 2:40:23.560]  trying to identify the globalists
[2:40:23.560 --> 2:40:24.560]  and how they're operating
[2:40:24.560 --> 2:40:26.560]  just to get people somewhat awake
[2:40:26.560 --> 2:40:28.560]  and then I believe in the power of crowdsourcing
[2:40:28.560 --> 2:40:30.560]  of the people that all of you
[2:40:30.560 --> 2:40:32.560]  are going to be able to crush these folks
[2:40:32.560 --> 2:40:34.560]  God bless you it's good to hear from you
[2:40:34.560 --> 2:40:37.560]  look despite all their propaganda
[2:40:37.560 --> 2:40:40.560]  people are turning against abortion worldwide
[2:40:40.560 --> 2:40:42.560]  not just here I mean a total flip in the numbers
[2:40:42.560 --> 2:40:44.560]  and they're turning against gun restriction
[2:40:44.560 --> 2:40:46.560]  and victim disarmament
[2:40:46.560 --> 2:40:48.560]  I mean we understand now what it's all about
[2:40:48.560 --> 2:40:50.560]  and the numbers are all there
[2:40:50.560 --> 2:40:52.560]  they're freaking out
[2:40:52.560 --> 2:40:54.560]  they're carbon taxes they're global warming
[2:40:54.560 --> 2:40:56.560]  they're environmental stuff
[2:40:56.560 --> 2:40:58.560]  being hand packed at the grocery store
[2:40:58.560 --> 2:41:00.560]  because you want to have a bag or whatever
[2:41:00.560 --> 2:41:03.560]  okay we can ban my bags
[2:41:03.560 --> 2:41:05.560]  when you stop doing cross species GMO
[2:41:05.560 --> 2:41:07.560]  and real environmental issues
[2:41:07.560 --> 2:41:09.560]  but see that's not what this is about
[2:41:09.560 --> 2:41:11.560]  these globalists could care less about the environment
[2:41:11.560 --> 2:41:13.560]  in fact they're so nihilistic it makes my head spin
[2:41:13.560 --> 2:41:15.560]  let's talk to John and Louisiana
[2:41:15.560 --> 2:41:17.560]  you're on the air sir go ahead
[2:41:17.560 --> 2:41:19.560]  hey Alex how's it going man
[2:41:19.560 --> 2:41:21.560]  pretty good
[2:41:21.560 --> 2:41:23.560]  I got a local GOP group
[2:41:23.560 --> 2:41:25.560]  reaching out for some libertarians
[2:41:25.560 --> 2:41:27.560]  and I just purchased Mr. Sussman's book
[2:41:27.560 --> 2:41:29.560]  about eco-territy
[2:41:29.560 --> 2:41:31.560]  and I think I'm going to present that to him
[2:41:31.560 --> 2:41:33.560]  and talk about that
[2:41:33.560 --> 2:41:35.560]  well thank you for the midair refueling
[2:41:35.560 --> 2:41:37.560]  you're welcome
[2:41:37.560 --> 2:41:39.560]  also the EPA down here in south Louisiana
[2:41:39.560 --> 2:41:41.560]  they're on this kick about
[2:41:41.560 --> 2:41:43.560]  any land with palmettos
[2:41:43.560 --> 2:41:45.560]  on it is classified as wetlands
[2:41:45.560 --> 2:41:47.560]  I've got news for them
[2:41:47.560 --> 2:41:49.560]  palmettos grow all over south Louisiana
[2:41:49.560 --> 2:41:51.560]  no no I saw that in the news
[2:41:51.560 --> 2:41:53.560]  they just pick a snail, a cave bug
[2:41:53.560 --> 2:41:55.560]  a palmetto
[2:41:55.560 --> 2:41:57.560]  beautiful by the way
[2:41:57.560 --> 2:41:59.560]  and just take over
[2:41:59.560 --> 2:42:01.560]  and that's what they do so they can say
[2:42:01.560 --> 2:42:03.560]  you don't own your land anymore
[2:42:03.560 --> 2:42:05.560]  and maybe if you pay them off and know the right people
[2:42:05.560 --> 2:42:07.560]  or give part of your land to Nature Conservancy
[2:42:07.560 --> 2:42:09.560]  or Sierra Club then you might be able to use your land
[2:42:09.560 --> 2:42:11.560]  this is nothing but
[2:42:11.560 --> 2:42:13.560]  these people are mafia period
[2:42:13.560 --> 2:42:15.560]  exactly but you can't get through
[2:42:15.560 --> 2:42:17.560]  but like you said you do have to pay off some people
[2:42:17.560 --> 2:42:19.560]  or know some people to get through
[2:42:19.560 --> 2:42:21.560]  that's what it's all about
[2:42:21.560 --> 2:42:23.560]  one more point I heard
[2:42:23.560 --> 2:42:25.560]  English documentary about
[2:42:25.560 --> 2:42:27.560]  they were talking about 9-11 and some other things
[2:42:27.560 --> 2:42:29.560]  and they mentioned common purpose
[2:42:29.560 --> 2:42:31.560]  do you know anything about that
[2:42:31.560 --> 2:42:33.560]  yeah they have a big group over there
[2:42:33.560 --> 2:42:35.560]  after they implode this society they create these fake charities
[2:42:35.560 --> 2:42:37.560]  that are government funded
[2:42:37.560 --> 2:42:39.560]  basically nanny state, ninny and spy
[2:42:39.560 --> 2:42:41.560]  and everything and that's what it does
[2:42:41.560 --> 2:42:43.560]  yeah
[2:42:43.560 --> 2:42:45.560]  yeah thank you
[2:42:45.560 --> 2:42:47.560]  yeah they've had my videos removed with people fighting them
[2:42:47.560 --> 2:42:49.560]  they claim copyright and stuff
[2:42:49.560 --> 2:42:51.560]  and have my
[2:42:51.560 --> 2:42:53.560]  that censored off the web
[2:42:53.560 --> 2:42:55.560]  not allowed to talk about our gracious leaders over in England
[2:42:55.560 --> 2:42:57.560]  let's talk to
[2:42:57.560 --> 2:42:59.560]  Brian in Colorado
[2:42:59.560 --> 2:43:01.560]  you're on the air Brian
[2:43:01.560 --> 2:43:03.560]  well Alex can you hear me?
[2:43:03.560 --> 2:43:05.560]  yes
[2:43:05.560 --> 2:43:07.560]  good to talk to you my friend
[2:43:07.560 --> 2:43:09.560]  I wanted to call you today to talk about
[2:43:09.560 --> 2:43:11.560]  drones my wife was followed by one yesterday
[2:43:11.560 --> 2:43:13.560]  on her way home from work
[2:43:13.560 --> 2:43:15.560]  yeah that's a show we should do
[2:43:15.560 --> 2:43:17.560]  is where we have everybody calling
[2:43:17.560 --> 2:43:19.560]  who's been followed by drones because I see it in newspapers everywhere now
[2:43:19.560 --> 2:43:21.560]  where the mayor sees one
[2:43:21.560 --> 2:43:23.560]  or this and that
[2:43:23.560 --> 2:43:25.560]  and it's happening all over little ones big ones
[2:43:25.560 --> 2:43:27.560]  flying low
[2:43:27.560 --> 2:43:29.560]  and they have announced 30,000 and they're being weaponized
[2:43:29.560 --> 2:43:31.560]  against us tell us what happened
[2:43:31.560 --> 2:43:33.560]  well she was driving home from work
[2:43:33.560 --> 2:43:35.560]  it was pretty late
[2:43:35.560 --> 2:43:37.560]  the sun was going down
[2:43:37.560 --> 2:43:39.560]  so she couldn't see it clearly
[2:43:39.560 --> 2:43:41.560]  but it was about
[2:43:41.560 --> 2:43:43.560]  she said about a foot or foot and a half in length
[2:43:43.560 --> 2:43:45.560]  and it was literally right behind her windshield
[2:43:45.560 --> 2:43:47.560]  her rear
[2:43:47.560 --> 2:43:49.560]  so she saw it in a rear view mirror
[2:43:49.560 --> 2:43:51.560]  yeah they loved to harass us with these
[2:43:51.560 --> 2:43:53.560]  yeah
[2:43:53.560 --> 2:43:55.560]  it's all part of us feeling small
[2:43:55.560 --> 2:43:57.560]  she's pretty dangerous
[2:43:57.560 --> 2:43:59.560]  she's a pregnant mother
[2:43:59.560 --> 2:44:01.560]  that is the most dangerous time
[2:44:01.560 --> 2:44:03.560]  they hate the family
[2:44:03.560 --> 2:44:05.560]  they hate the unborn child but go ahead
[2:44:05.560 --> 2:44:07.560]  exactly
[2:44:07.560 --> 2:44:09.560]  so yeah she said it was bird-like
[2:44:09.560 --> 2:44:11.560]  and it had wings that were doing
[2:44:11.560 --> 2:44:13.560]  some kind of a crazy flapping on it
[2:44:13.560 --> 2:44:15.560]  and it followed her for about
[2:44:15.560 --> 2:44:17.560]  probably three miles
[2:44:17.560 --> 2:44:19.560]  and that's all that she could see of it
[2:44:19.560 --> 2:44:21.560]  who knows if it was above her or
[2:44:21.560 --> 2:44:23.560]  in some other position where she couldn't see it
[2:44:23.560 --> 2:44:25.560]  well it happened to Joe Farrah
[2:44:25.560 --> 2:44:27.560]  it's happened to a lot of people I know
[2:44:27.560 --> 2:44:29.560]  but I mean
[2:44:29.560 --> 2:44:31.560]  I've talked to a family member
[2:44:31.560 --> 2:44:33.560]  who saw a bigger drone at about a thousand feet
[2:44:33.560 --> 2:44:35.560]  but it was clearly small enough that it wasn't
[2:44:35.560 --> 2:44:37.560]  piloted and it had a red light
[2:44:37.560 --> 2:44:39.560]  on the nose that was it flying around
[2:44:39.560 --> 2:44:41.560]  at dusk
[2:44:41.560 --> 2:44:43.560]  I mean it's it's going on they're launching them everywhere
[2:44:43.560 --> 2:44:45.560]  Texas is leading the way
[2:44:45.560 --> 2:44:47.560]  Ardee Soveda next time I get him in studio
[2:44:47.560 --> 2:44:49.560]  he's got the courage to do it I shouldn't challenge him
[2:44:49.560 --> 2:44:51.560]  he does obviously Mr. Charming
[2:44:51.560 --> 2:44:53.560]  let me just
[2:44:53.560 --> 2:44:55.560]  that's a really good guy a really bad guy yet
[2:44:55.560 --> 2:44:57.560]  he's a bad guy he's really bad because I don't
[2:44:57.560 --> 2:44:59.560]  think up that he's a bad guy but he does bad things
[2:44:59.560 --> 2:45:01.560]  a lot of good guys that paved the road to hell with good intentions
[2:45:01.560 --> 2:45:03.560]  they wanted this big expensive you know
[2:45:03.560 --> 2:45:05.560]  multi how much was it
[2:45:05.560 --> 2:45:07.560]  like 15 million or something with some helicopter
[2:45:07.560 --> 2:45:09.560]  and that obviously got thrown out
[2:45:09.560 --> 2:45:11.560]  so he goes well the answer is a bunch of drones
[2:45:11.560 --> 2:45:13.560]  and they already got them crashing
[2:45:13.560 --> 2:45:15.560]  and running into other airplanes and it's just going to be no big deal
[2:45:15.560 --> 2:45:17.560]  see when there's a real threat
[2:45:17.560 --> 2:45:19.560]  like Mexico collapsing 40 plus
[2:45:19.560 --> 2:45:21.560]  to 60,000 dead they argue the numbers
[2:45:21.560 --> 2:45:23.560]  hundreds of heads being dumped off everywhere
[2:45:23.560 --> 2:45:25.560]  that's no big deal
[2:45:25.560 --> 2:45:27.560]  and drones crashing and all the rest of it
[2:45:27.560 --> 2:45:29.560]  that'll be no big deal but Al Qaeda now
[2:45:29.560 --> 2:45:31.560]  that's really scary I appreciate your call
[2:45:31.560 --> 2:45:33.560]  let me hit the news
[2:45:33.560 --> 2:45:35.560]  now some of the news I didn't get to
[2:45:35.560 --> 2:45:37.560]  and then we'll go back to calls but I promise
[2:45:37.560 --> 2:45:39.560]  to get to this
[2:45:39.560 --> 2:45:41.560]  again report out of
[2:45:41.560 --> 2:45:43.560]  why net news Syria
[2:45:43.560 --> 2:45:45.560]  moves missiles
[2:45:45.560 --> 2:45:47.560]  to Lebanese border
[2:45:47.560 --> 2:45:49.560]  days after Netanyahu
[2:45:49.560 --> 2:45:51.560]  and Barak warned of possible military intervention in Syria
[2:45:51.560 --> 2:45:53.560]  Assad moves anti-aircraft missile
[2:45:53.560 --> 2:45:55.560]  batteries, Lebanese border
[2:45:55.560 --> 2:45:57.560]  this is just getting crazy
[2:45:57.560 --> 2:45:59.560]  and Israel fighting on the side of Al Qaeda
[2:45:59.560 --> 2:46:01.560]  and that's the reality
[2:46:01.560 --> 2:46:03.560]  but it doesn't fit the script so people just
[2:46:03.560 --> 2:46:05.560]  if you can get somebody to wake up to this
[2:46:05.560 --> 2:46:07.560]  which is admitted
[2:46:07.560 --> 2:46:09.560]  they may be able to break their matrix programming
[2:46:09.560 --> 2:46:11.560]  because the people running Israel could care less about Israel
[2:46:11.560 --> 2:46:13.560]  the people running Israel
[2:46:13.560 --> 2:46:15.560]  and it's beyond Netanyahu
[2:46:15.560 --> 2:46:17.560]  and these puppet characters
[2:46:17.560 --> 2:46:19.560]  radiated 110,000 Jewish children
[2:46:19.560 --> 2:46:21.560]  and killed most of them with the ringworm children
[2:46:21.560 --> 2:46:23.560]  look it up
[2:46:23.560 --> 2:46:25.560]  so the globalists hate everybody
[2:46:25.560 --> 2:46:27.560]  let's continue, the Jerusalem Post
[2:46:27.560 --> 2:46:29.560]  don't attack Iran now
[2:46:29.560 --> 2:46:31.560]  warns ex-IDF chief
[2:46:31.560 --> 2:46:33.560]  so we've got that saying it'll be a disaster
[2:46:33.560 --> 2:46:35.560]  Ahmed Denizi
[2:46:35.560 --> 2:46:37.560]  actually said and here it is how the Jerusalem Post
[2:46:37.560 --> 2:46:39.560]  that anyone who loves freedom and justice
[2:46:39.560 --> 2:46:41.560]  must strive for the annihilation of the Zionist regime
[2:46:41.560 --> 2:46:43.560]  that means the government when you say regime
[2:46:43.560 --> 2:46:45.560]  in order to pave the way for world justice
[2:46:45.560 --> 2:46:47.560]  and freedom
[2:46:47.560 --> 2:46:49.560]  but that was taken
[2:46:49.560 --> 2:46:51.560]  and that's an inflammatory comment right there
[2:46:51.560 --> 2:46:53.560]  but Ahmed Denizi's world forces
[2:46:53.560 --> 2:46:55.560]  must annihilate Israel
[2:46:55.560 --> 2:46:57.560]  that's not actually what he said
[2:46:57.560 --> 2:46:59.560]  but what do you expect
[2:46:59.560 --> 2:47:01.560]  Israel Prime Minister says time running out
[2:47:01.560 --> 2:47:03.560]  to stop Iran's nuclear program
[2:47:03.560 --> 2:47:05.560]  here's the New York Times
[2:47:05.560 --> 2:47:07.560]  Israel intensifies with the U.S. talks on Iran options
[2:47:07.560 --> 2:47:09.560]  so that's all starting to come to a head
[2:47:09.560 --> 2:47:11.560]  and then right here
[2:47:11.560 --> 2:47:13.560]  Al Qaeda
[2:47:13.560 --> 2:47:15.560]  directs free Syrian Army
[2:47:15.560 --> 2:47:17.560]  in control demolition of Syria

[2:47:19.560 --> 2:47:21.560]  by Suzanne Pozel
[2:47:21.560 --> 2:47:23.560]  who's been doing a great job
[2:47:23.560 --> 2:47:25.560]  one of her stories last week got up on Drudge
[2:47:25.560 --> 2:47:27.560]  DrudgeReport.com
[2:47:27.560 --> 2:47:29.560]  she just breaks down all the mainstream links
[2:47:29.560 --> 2:47:31.560]  to Al Qaeda being the main force
[2:47:31.560 --> 2:47:33.560]  I've got a bunch of those articles right here
[2:47:33.560 --> 2:47:35.560]  I had told us yesterday
[2:47:35.560 --> 2:47:37.560]  war within weeks I ran prepared for strike
[2:47:37.560 --> 2:47:39.560]  on nuclear facilities in September or October
[2:47:39.560 --> 2:47:41.560]  as we've been telling you
[2:47:41.560 --> 2:47:43.560]  they're getting ready for martial law here
[2:47:43.560 --> 2:47:45.560]  the police have never been told
[2:47:45.560 --> 2:47:47.560]  martial law in the military so it looks like
[2:47:47.560 --> 2:47:49.560]  they may be planning it then they're going to blow stuff up
[2:47:49.560 --> 2:47:51.560]  here to blame it on Iran
[2:47:51.560 --> 2:47:53.560]  you can you can you can bet your bottom dollar
[2:47:53.560 --> 2:47:55.560]  that's going to happen if they do trigger the war
[2:47:55.560 --> 2:47:57.560]  and they'll use that to roll out TSA
[2:47:57.560 --> 2:47:59.560]  nationwide and begin the groping the new
[2:47:59.560 --> 2:48:01.560]  sacrament of your family
[2:48:01.560 --> 2:48:03.560]  the end of Al Qaeda U.S. claims it has broken
[2:48:03.560 --> 2:48:05.560]  the back of terrorist group that it funded and created
[2:48:05.560 --> 2:48:07.560]  not the U.S. but the bankers that run us
[2:48:07.560 --> 2:48:09.560]  as attacks fall to 2005 levels
[2:48:09.560 --> 2:48:11.560]  you mean as they because all the Al Qaeda people
[2:48:11.560 --> 2:48:13.560]  are in Libya and Syria you mean
[2:48:13.560 --> 2:48:15.560]  well you may know I mean it's just it's just unbelievable
[2:48:15.560 --> 2:48:17.560]  here's one and guardian
[2:48:17.560 --> 2:48:19.560]  Syrian rebels who have to be Al Qaeda
[2:48:19.560 --> 2:48:21.560]  add explosive expertise to guerrilla tactics
[2:48:21.560 --> 2:48:23.560]  and they've got
[2:48:23.560 --> 2:48:25.560]  the U.S. NATO and Israel
[2:48:25.560 --> 2:48:27.560]  and Turkey that's in all the news
[2:48:27.560 --> 2:48:29.560]  shipping anti-aircraft missiles into them
[2:48:29.560 --> 2:48:31.560]  and of course they got over 10,000 of those
[2:48:31.560 --> 2:48:33.560]  from Qaddafi Al Qaeda did after
[2:48:33.560 --> 2:48:35.560]  after they took him out including
[2:48:35.560 --> 2:48:37.560]  2,000 that were guided
[2:48:37.560 --> 2:48:39.560]  heat seeker and radar seeker
[2:48:39.560 --> 2:48:41.560]  okay always nice
[2:48:41.560 --> 2:48:43.560]  to have a radar missile shooting to your
[2:48:43.560 --> 2:48:45.560]  engine when you take off
[2:48:45.560 --> 2:48:47.560]  they're at the local airport of course they'll just use that to take our rights
[2:48:47.560 --> 2:48:49.560]  works perfectly use Al Qaeda to take over
[2:48:49.560 --> 2:48:51.560]  other countries use the fear up and take our rights here
[2:48:51.560 --> 2:48:53.560]  sounds good doesn't it for the new old order
[2:48:53.560 --> 2:48:55.560]  alright there's one and guardian here's

[2:49:03.560 --> 2:49:05.560]  for rebels and battles for eastern Syria
[2:49:05.560 --> 2:49:07.560]  and it goes on to say how great Al Qaeda is
[2:49:07.560 --> 2:49:09.560]  okay
[2:49:09.560 --> 2:49:11.560]  Obama signs order supporting Syria's

[2:49:17.560 --> 2:49:19.560]  operated by Turkey and its allies
[2:49:19.560 --> 2:49:21.560]  that's AP one and guardian Reuters and
[2:49:21.560 --> 2:49:23.560]  the main command force is Al Qaeda

[2:49:53.560 --> 2:49:55.560]  by Harriet S. Ables this is

[2:50:03.560 --> 2:50:05.560]  I remember reading this book when I was in elementary
[2:50:05.560 --> 2:50:07.560]  school while someone handed it to me at
[2:50:07.560 --> 2:50:09.560]  Bilderberg protest I was I was like whoa I've
[2:50:09.560 --> 2:50:11.560]  read this as a child I read the whole
[2:50:11.560 --> 2:50:13.560]  series I remember reading it and
[2:50:13.560 --> 2:50:15.560]  thinking didn't sound too good but I was
[2:50:15.560 --> 2:50:17.560]  like six or seven years old could barely
[2:50:17.560 --> 2:50:19.560]  read but

[2:50:59.560 --> 2:51:01.560]  stay with us
[2:51:01.560 --> 2:51:03.560]  hi this is Alex Jones did you know
[2:51:03.560 --> 2:51:05.560]  that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid
[2:51:05.560 --> 2:51:07.560]  seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic
[2:51:07.560 --> 2:51:09.560]  Circle did you know that in a real meltdown
[2:51:09.560 --> 2:51:11.560]  non-hybrid seeds could become more
[2:51:11.560 --> 2:51:13.560]  valuable than silver or gold
[2:51:13.560 --> 2:51:15.560]  it's true seeds have all performed even gold and silver
[2:51:15.560 --> 2:51:17.560]  before in this country and it's possible
[2:51:17.560 --> 2:51:19.560]  that could even happen again so our friends

[2:54:39.560 --> 2:54:41.560]  two old Kentucky
[2:54:41.560 --> 2:54:43.560]  alright let's go ahead
[2:54:43.560 --> 2:54:45.560]  we got a guy from Kentucky works in here
[2:54:45.560 --> 2:54:47.560]  he bid farewell to old Kentucky
[2:54:47.560 --> 2:54:49.560]  where he was born and raised
[2:54:51.560 --> 2:54:53.560]  good movie
[2:54:53.560 --> 2:54:55.560]  economy ads
[2:54:55.560 --> 2:54:57.560]  supposed to be the Iliad
[2:54:57.560 --> 2:54:59.560]  it's like a takeoff on that
[2:54:59.560 --> 2:55:01.560]  the Odyssey, the Iliad
[2:55:01.560 --> 2:55:03.560]  the Iliad
[2:55:03.560 --> 2:55:05.560]  economy ads
[2:55:05.560 --> 2:55:07.560]  1,163,000 jobs
[2:55:07.560 --> 2:55:09.560]  and again I kind of mentioned some of this
[2:55:09.560 --> 2:55:11.560]  economic news earlier let me get to the bottom of it
[2:55:11.560 --> 2:55:13.560]  that's why I'm going back through it
[2:55:13.560 --> 2:55:15.560]  and I've got all these articles
[2:55:15.560 --> 2:55:17.560]  where they say that oh we've gained
[2:55:17.560 --> 2:55:19.560]  a little bit of jobs but then
[2:55:19.560 --> 2:55:21.560]  seeing as news breaks down that there were
[2:55:21.560 --> 2:55:23.560]  195,000 fewer people employed
[2:55:23.560 --> 2:55:25.560]  in the United States in July
[2:55:25.560 --> 2:55:27.560]  that in June according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics
[2:55:27.560 --> 2:55:29.560]  as the national unemployment rate ticked
[2:55:29.560 --> 2:55:31.560]  up to 8.2
[2:55:31.560 --> 2:55:33.560]  and then it actually
[2:55:33.560 --> 2:55:35.560]  goes over the numbers
[2:55:35.560 --> 2:55:37.560]  and there's also a
[2:55:37.560 --> 2:55:39.560]  CNBC article here
[2:55:39.560 --> 2:55:41.560]  where they admit
[2:55:41.560 --> 2:55:43.560]  that real unemployment rate
[2:55:43.560 --> 2:55:45.560]  shows far more jobless
[2:55:45.560 --> 2:55:47.560]  because they don't count people
[2:55:47.560 --> 2:55:49.560]  that have gone off the unemployment rolls
[2:55:49.560 --> 2:55:51.560]  and just given up
[2:55:51.560 --> 2:55:53.560]  that's 22.1%
[2:55:53.560 --> 2:55:55.560]  that's Nevada California at 20.3%
[2:55:55.560 --> 2:55:57.560]  all this stuff you're hanging
[2:55:57.560 --> 2:55:59.560]  being debated is just
[2:55:59.560 --> 2:56:01.560]  pure smoke and mirrors
[2:56:01.560 --> 2:56:03.560]  it's all a distraction I can't believe Romney even takes part
[2:56:03.560 --> 2:56:05.560]  in it but of course I do because he's bought and paid for by the same people
[2:56:05.560 --> 2:56:07.560]  also California
[2:56:07.560 --> 2:56:09.560]  was really counting on that
[2:56:09.560 --> 2:56:11.560]  Facebook scam money but
[2:56:11.560 --> 2:56:13.560]  now that crash
[2:56:13.560 --> 2:56:15.560]  has hosed California tax revenue
[2:56:15.560 --> 2:56:17.560]  poor government what will you do
[2:56:17.560 --> 2:56:19.560]  again they tell the cops go out and write more tickets
[2:56:19.560 --> 2:56:21.560]  I saw this
[2:56:21.560 --> 2:56:23.560]  ad for a newscast
[2:56:23.560 --> 2:56:25.560]  yesterday
[2:56:25.560 --> 2:56:27.560]  I wasn't watching TV at home I see it around the office
[2:56:27.560 --> 2:56:29.560]  I guess and it was like police don't even have
[2:56:29.560 --> 2:56:31.560]  body armor it's held together with
[2:56:31.560 --> 2:56:33.560]  duct tape and their cars are falling
[2:56:33.560 --> 2:56:35.560]  apart they need more money
[2:56:35.560 --> 2:56:37.560]  well yeah because almost all the money you generate
[2:56:37.560 --> 2:56:39.560]  goes to the city
[2:56:39.560 --> 2:56:41.560]  and then that goes to be
[2:56:41.560 --> 2:56:43.560]  invested in things that are never meant to be paid
[2:56:43.560 --> 2:56:45.560]  because it's all a big scam
[2:56:45.560 --> 2:56:47.560]  but they tell the cops
[2:56:47.560 --> 2:56:49.560]  go write more tickets
[2:56:49.560 --> 2:56:51.560]  we don't have money for tires or radios
[2:56:51.560 --> 2:56:53.560]  it's the oldest scam in the book
[2:56:53.560 --> 2:56:55.560]  you just gotta love scams
[2:56:55.560 --> 2:56:57.560]  land of the scam, home of the slave
[2:56:57.560 --> 2:56:59.560]  Facebook growth clouded by dubious accounts
[2:56:59.560 --> 2:57:01.560]  and that's AFP and fake bots
[2:57:01.560 --> 2:57:03.560]  going around
[2:57:03.560 --> 2:57:05.560]  we told you about that last week but now here it is
[2:57:05.560 --> 2:57:07.560]  in the news
[2:57:07.560 --> 2:57:09.560]  running major scam
[2:57:09.560 --> 2:57:11.560]  on the mark that is us
[2:57:11.560 --> 2:57:13.560]  Facebook stock near
[2:57:13.560 --> 2:57:15.560]  half off its original price
[2:57:15.560 --> 2:57:17.560]  of course the owners of it all dumped it
[2:57:17.560 --> 2:57:19.560]  right when they got it most of it
[2:57:19.560 --> 2:57:21.560]  but they won't get in trouble like Martha Stewart
[2:57:21.560 --> 2:57:23.560]  who did nothing the real crime bosses
[2:57:23.560 --> 2:57:25.560]  that's why they run the new world order
[2:57:25.560 --> 2:57:27.560]  that's what it's all about
[2:57:27.560 --> 2:57:29.560]  don't worry though the cops
[2:57:29.560 --> 2:57:31.560]  will write old ladies more tickets
[2:57:31.560 --> 2:57:33.560]  continuing here
[2:57:33.560 --> 2:57:35.560]  IRS pays out
[2:57:35.560 --> 2:57:37.560]  billions in fraudulent refunds
[2:57:37.560 --> 2:57:39.560]  CMBC mainly to illegal aliens
[2:57:39.560 --> 2:57:41.560]  I'm very close to getting a big IRS whistleblower
[2:57:41.560 --> 2:57:43.560]  on the show
[2:57:43.560 --> 2:57:45.560]  that's just some of the nice
[2:57:45.560 --> 2:57:47.560]  economic news there
[2:57:47.560 --> 2:57:49.560]  Vacant Detroit becomes dumping ground for the dead
[2:57:49.560 --> 2:57:51.560]  that's associated press but they're not hyping up
[2:57:51.560 --> 2:57:53.560]  all the dead bodies that get dumped there
[2:57:53.560 --> 2:57:55.560]  in the government wonderland
[2:57:55.560 --> 2:57:57.560]  imagine what $23 billion
[2:57:57.560 --> 2:57:59.560]  and taxpayer money could have done to rebuild Detroit
[2:57:59.560 --> 2:58:01.560]  but instead it went to ship General Motors to China
[2:58:01.560 --> 2:58:03.560]  but that's okay because Obama cares about us
[2:58:03.560 --> 2:58:05.560]  San Bernardino
[2:58:05.560 --> 2:58:07.560]  files for Chapter 9
[2:58:07.560 --> 2:58:09.560]  Bankruptcy
[2:58:09.560 --> 2:58:11.560]  and that's good
[2:58:11.560 --> 2:58:13.560]  because the feds will then take over
[2:58:13.560 --> 2:58:15.560]  and the globalists when they bankrupt
[2:58:15.560 --> 2:58:17.560]  the federal government will take that over
[2:58:17.560 --> 2:58:19.560]  we're going into receivership
[2:58:19.560 --> 2:58:21.560]  it's wonderful to be slaves to the bankers
[2:58:21.560 --> 2:58:23.560]  the feds gold is being audited
[2:58:23.560 --> 2:58:25.560]  by the treasury which it controls
[2:58:25.560 --> 2:58:27.560]  zero hedge
[2:58:27.560 --> 2:58:29.560]  Spain and Italy are toast unless Germany allows the ECB
[2:58:29.560 --> 2:58:31.560]  to print trillions of euros
[2:58:31.560 --> 2:58:33.560]  it goes directly to the bankers
[2:58:33.560 --> 2:58:35.560]  and that is just some of the news there
[2:58:35.560 --> 2:58:37.560]  like I said this Sunday
[2:58:37.560 --> 2:58:39.560]  next week we got a big transmission
