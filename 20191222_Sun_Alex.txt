[00:00:00.689 --> 00:00:02.990]  Ohhhhhhhhhh
[00:00:49.261 --> 00:00:53.983]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Sunday, the 22nd day of December 2019.
[00:00:53.983 --> 00:00:55.584]  And I am going to try my best today to be very serene,
[00:01:18.103 --> 00:01:24.728]  Calm and genteel and measured for as long as I can.
[00:01:24.728 --> 00:01:34.435]  So that I can note to the audience that we are in very serious times.
[00:01:34.435 --> 00:01:41.560]  And that yes, it's good to be loud and it's good to shout to get people's attention sometimes.
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.622]  Sometimes it's important to whisper.
[00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:57.975]  And that's something that I don't do enough of here on air.
[00:01:57.975 --> 00:02:09.781]  But that I'm going to be doing today to just slow down and make sure I cover everything.
[00:02:09.781 --> 00:02:12.763]  Because you think you speed up and
[00:02:14.656 --> 00:02:23.879]  You get to everything, but sometimes you do miss the forest for the trees.
[00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:32.221]  And so today I'm going to lay out the news and information as best I can.
[00:02:32.221 --> 00:02:39.303]  This morning I was going over the breaking developments that are so incredible around our world, not just in the United States.
[00:02:39.303 --> 00:02:43.844]  And I thought, man, I've got to really go on air and really drive it home to people.
[00:02:45.427 --> 00:02:49.030]  And I've got to really shake them out of their trance.
[00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:59.138]  Not our general audience, but create a broadcast, create a record that can be given to others to really hopefully get them out of their trance.
[00:02:59.138 --> 00:03:01.019]  And sometimes yelling at people is the way to do it.
[00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.981]  Sometimes hitting them side of the head politically with a 2x4.
[00:03:03.981 --> 00:03:09.846]  But other times, to get somebody out of a trance, you've got to whisper to them.
[00:03:11.707 --> 00:03:17.929]  So we're going to go to break here in a few minutes and I'm not even going to tell you what the news is yet until we come back.
[00:03:17.929 --> 00:03:36.855]  But if you go to InfoHorse.com and you see the live feed of the show today, the Sunday live feed and what it's titled, you'll see how incredibly important this show is.
[00:03:36.855 --> 00:03:39.076]  And not just what was said by the Attorney General,
[00:03:40.444 --> 00:03:52.334]  But what was said by others in the administration and the movement that we've seen, we have a very clear direction of where Trump's going.
[00:03:52.334 --> 00:04:00.981]  And he understands with only 320 days left until the historic election, he can't wait because they're going to try to steal the election.
[00:04:00.981 --> 00:04:02.462]  Yes, America's waking up.
[00:04:02.462 --> 00:04:03.783]  Yes, Trump's winning.
[00:04:03.783 --> 00:04:06.085]  Yes, a lot of what the globalists are trying to do is failing.
[00:04:08.356 --> 00:04:22.901]  They're cheating and engaged in so much criminal activity that we can't stand by and watch them do that.
[00:04:22.901 --> 00:04:27.083]  So the Attorney General has called out George Soros.
[00:04:27.083 --> 00:04:31.504]  When we come back from break, I'm going to just break down why that's so important and play the clip.
[00:04:31.504 --> 00:04:36.546]  And then the globalist plan to try to trigger civil unrest and martial law in this country that's now official.
[00:04:37.751 --> 00:04:41.696]  It's all coming up today.
[00:04:41.696 --> 00:04:48.764]  InfoWars.com, sportslashshow, and band.video.
[00:04:48.764 --> 00:04:52.569]  It's all coming up right now.
[00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:53.730]  Please help us spread the word.
[00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.794]  You're the only way we reach new people that desperately need to be warned.
[00:05:02.603 --> 00:05:04.264]  Owl Killer in New Jersey.
[00:05:04.264 --> 00:05:04.844]  You're on the air.
[00:05:04.844 --> 00:05:05.424]  Go ahead.
[00:05:05.424 --> 00:05:08.186]  Alex, hey, I just want to say it's great to be back once again.
[00:05:08.186 --> 00:05:11.267]  And I've never gotten to do this, but I'm going to give you a shout out for your product.
[00:05:11.267 --> 00:05:16.550]  So that's Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste and that Super Blue Whitening Toothpaste is on another level.
[00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:21.712]  I use the one I use the Super Blue in the morning and then the whitening at night and it absorbs into your gum.
[00:05:21.712 --> 00:05:24.514]  It is by far the best product I've ever used in my life.
[00:05:24.514 --> 00:05:27.175]  I literally just took turbo force on my way to the gym right now.
[00:05:27.375 --> 00:05:35.460]  I've had four shoulder surgeries and a back surgery, and that body has made me feel better than any type of physical therapy or anything that I've ever done in my life.
[00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:36.801]  So I just want to get that out of the way.
[00:05:36.801 --> 00:05:37.782]  Support this man.
[00:05:37.782 --> 00:05:39.223]  Everything that he exposed.
[00:05:39.223 --> 00:05:40.644]  Nobody knew about Bohemian Grove.
[00:05:40.644 --> 00:05:41.764]  Nobody knew about Epstein.
[00:05:41.764 --> 00:05:43.065]  Nobody knew about Bilderberg.
[00:05:43.065 --> 00:05:45.907]  Nobody called 9-11 before it happened in July 2001.
[00:05:45.907 --> 00:05:47.568]  Don't look it up yourself.
[00:05:47.568 --> 00:05:48.729]  Well, we try our best, sir.
[00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:49.950]  They definitely want us off the air.
[00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:50.850]  Without you, we're not here.
[00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.751]  But yeah, these are all great products, so thank you, sir.
[00:06:31.533 --> 00:06:36.895]  We are live on this Sunday, December 22nd, 2019.
[00:06:36.895 --> 00:06:44.079]  Worldwide broadcast.
[00:06:44.079 --> 00:06:51.522]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:06:51.522 --> 00:06:55.624]  The United States was done for.
[00:06:55.624 --> 00:06:57.085]  Was captured.
[00:07:00.242 --> 00:07:09.567]  The decision had been made to make Communist China and its authoritarian command and control system the model of the world.
[00:07:09.567 --> 00:07:24.956]  The United Nations has adopted Communist China and their social credit score and a biometric face scan code key as the world currency officially last week.
[00:07:27.878 --> 00:07:29.939]  That's right, of pieces of paper.
[00:07:29.939 --> 00:07:32.080]  With ink on them could be the money.
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.222]  Can't your face scan be the money?
[00:07:34.222 --> 00:07:39.145]  And the digital numbers attached to you?
[00:07:39.145 --> 00:07:40.866]  That's not some Bible study.
[00:07:40.866 --> 00:07:45.989]  That's some evangelical church in the 1960s.
[00:07:45.989 --> 00:07:48.550]  Though they were saying that was coming.
[00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:51.472]  That's the waning twilight hours.
[00:07:54.508 --> 00:07:55.268]  Of 2019.
[00:07:55.268 --> 00:08:09.075]  And the fight is between will we have a future based on the greater ideals of Christendom and the Renaissance and the true enlightenment and America?
[00:08:09.075 --> 00:08:19.539]  Or of the anti-human, godless, beyond evil, communist Chinese and their globalist allies.
[00:08:19.539 --> 00:08:20.740]  George Soros
[00:08:23.086 --> 00:08:34.171]  He's one of the main deep state controllers of the takedown of the Western world and the persecution of Christian institutions.
[00:08:34.171 --> 00:08:49.877]  He admits on CNN with Fareed Zakaria three years ago that he used five billion dollars of State Department money given to him by Barack Obama and that he directed
[00:08:54.654 --> 00:08:58.875]  Civil War and overthrow of the elected government of Ukraine.
[00:08:58.875 --> 00:09:01.696]  That's just one thing he bragged about.
[00:09:01.696 --> 00:09:04.477]  Just type it in to a search engine.
[00:09:04.477 --> 00:09:12.939]  George Soros told Fareed Zarkaria that he overthrew the Ukrainian government.
[00:09:12.939 --> 00:09:14.639]  That he was behind the revolution.
[00:09:14.639 --> 00:09:18.440]  You'll get CNN.com and the video.
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:20.901]  Now why is that so important?
[00:09:22.779 --> 00:09:42.614]  Because when Donald John Trump and his surrogates talk about that, like Lou Dobbs or Tucker Carlson or Alex Jones, MSNBC, CNN and even Fox come out and apologize and say, we're not going to have the head of Judicial Watch on ever again.
[00:09:42.614 --> 00:09:44.576]  He's banned.
[00:09:44.576 --> 00:09:51.181]  For in January of this year, 11 months ago, saying,
[00:09:52.131 --> 00:09:54.673]  Soros still has people in control of the State Department.
[00:09:54.673 --> 00:10:01.178]  They're getting the money through USAID to fund the collapse of the border and the refugee centers.
[00:10:01.178 --> 00:10:05.302]  That was true!
[00:10:05.302 --> 00:10:16.851]  But the news said it wasn't.
[00:10:16.851 --> 00:10:21.094]  And pretended like that was fake news, just like Fiona Hill a month ago.
[00:10:22.486 --> 00:10:29.129]  In the whole fake situation with the impeachment hearings.
[00:10:29.129 --> 00:10:30.730]  They said, do you know George Soros?
[00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:31.570]  Did you work for him?
[00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:34.431]  She's like, no.
[00:10:34.431 --> 00:10:35.252]  Are you a globalist?
[00:10:35.252 --> 00:10:37.573]  No, I don't know what that is.
[00:10:37.573 --> 00:10:38.473]  Are you a leftist?
[00:10:38.473 --> 00:10:40.454]  Well, yes, a European leftist.
[00:10:40.454 --> 00:10:43.936]  That's a communist.
[00:10:43.936 --> 00:10:46.477]  She said, nothing Roger Stone and Alex Jones say about me is true.
[00:10:46.477 --> 00:10:50.399]  And they went on to say, well, he'll serve prison for his lies.
[00:10:52.185 --> 00:11:00.370]  Well, Prince Valiant was the head board member on the main foundation run by Soros.
[00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:01.971]  Funded by Soros.
[00:11:01.971 --> 00:11:06.874]  But you could technically say she didn't work for him because he isn't on the foundation board.
[00:11:06.874 --> 00:11:10.956]  He just created it and funded it.
[00:11:10.956 --> 00:11:17.199]  It's like saying I don't... I'm not connected to my mother because my umbilical cord was cut 45 years ago.
[00:11:17.199 --> 00:11:18.340]  But I'm connected to my mother.
[00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:19.421]  I came out of her loins.
[00:11:21.107 --> 00:11:22.488]  Now why do they do that?
[00:11:22.488 --> 00:11:23.389]  This is the key to everything.
[00:11:23.389 --> 00:11:24.450]  I've got all this news.
[00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:27.753]  The key to this.
[00:11:27.753 --> 00:11:35.099]  Because it's the elephant in the room, the crimes they've committed, the things they've done.
[00:11:35.099 --> 00:11:49.391]  The documents I have right here, that are public, where Alexander Soros gives hundreds of millions of dollars to local leftist organizations in Antifa to go out with the express
[00:11:50.518 --> 00:11:57.862]  Orders to try to get black people to riot and create a civil war.
[00:11:57.862 --> 00:12:02.025]  Well, the Attorney General, we got these documents two years ago.
[00:12:02.025 --> 00:12:04.166]  January of 2018.
[00:12:04.166 --> 00:12:06.228]  So, 23 months ago.
[00:12:06.228 --> 00:12:06.968]  Huge story.
[00:12:06.968 --> 00:12:11.171]  Documents to tell plan for civil unrest and martial law in Baltimore.
[00:12:11.171 --> 00:12:13.672]  This is organized crime.
[00:12:13.672 --> 00:12:17.174]  This is racketeering.
[00:12:17.174 --> 00:12:18.375]  Statute of limitations isn't up.
[00:12:20.575 --> 00:12:26.280]  You can indict Soros and his son now for this, open and shut.
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:28.401]  Now why is that so important?
[00:12:28.401 --> 00:12:32.965]  Why is that so critical?
[00:12:32.965 --> 00:12:46.736]  Because I have a stack of news and court rulings and documents where AG Barr says, we need to fish or cut bait, that's a quote.
[00:12:46.736 --> 00:12:49.458]  Another way of saying, crap or get off the pot.
[00:12:50.984 --> 00:12:57.967]  He said, we either need to do that on antitrust by the next few months or drop it.
[00:12:57.967 --> 00:13:02.129]  But he said, but that's not letting big tech off the hook.
[00:13:02.129 --> 00:13:06.010]  He said, they've been involved in criminal activities.
[00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:13.193]  We believe that we're investigating with foundations.
[00:13:13.193 --> 00:13:16.835]  I'm going to read you the quotes coming up.
[00:13:16.835 --> 00:13:18.936]  Now, who do you think those foundations are?
[00:13:19.881 --> 00:13:21.421]  Government comes and goes.
[00:13:21.421 --> 00:13:22.982]  Bureaucrats even come and go.
[00:13:22.982 --> 00:13:24.282]  But not the foundations.
[00:13:24.282 --> 00:13:26.862]  They are the ones that train the bureaucrats.
[00:13:26.862 --> 00:13:28.263]  And have the funding.
[00:13:28.263 --> 00:13:31.683]  It's outside of politics.
[00:13:31.683 --> 00:13:36.784]  So Republicans may be raising money, 6 to 1, right now, with cash on hand.
[00:13:36.784 --> 00:13:38.225]  That doesn't matter.
[00:13:38.225 --> 00:13:44.026]  Because the Democrats had all political advertising banned on the internet, basically, because they don't call their propaganda.
[00:13:46.564 --> 00:13:57.673]  Political ads, they call it news or foundation, public interest behavior, Chicago social justice organizing.
[00:13:57.673 --> 00:14:08.882]  So here's the Attorney General, not just saying Comey's a liar, he played that last week, but now saying that Soros
[00:14:10.137 --> 00:14:14.560]  Is taking over DAs, hundreds of them, and sheriffs.
[00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:16.121]  And then it's organized crime.
[00:14:16.121 --> 00:14:20.764]  I mean, imagine if the mafia was trying to buy off sheriffs and DAs.
[00:14:20.764 --> 00:14:31.552]  The FBI would bust those DAs faster than a twinkle in your mother's eye.
[00:14:31.552 --> 00:14:33.813]  Think about that.
[00:14:33.813 --> 00:14:39.197]  And so, Barr and Trump are getting ready to make their move.
[00:14:42.403 --> 00:14:47.346]  And now you see Horowitz coming out saying it's all criminal, reversing himself.
[00:14:47.346 --> 00:15:09.760]  You see all the rest of them reversing themselves because they know the hammer's coming down, and they know that they've been caught in the corruption, and they know that they better signify to Trump that they are going to play ball and let the country be great again, and let the globalists be thrown out of this nation and defeated, or they're going to go to prison as well.
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:11.862]  So I'm seeing a rout right now.
[00:15:13.706 --> 00:15:18.909]  Of globalist forces.
[00:15:18.909 --> 00:15:29.554]  And you see poll numbers admitting that Trump's way up even in skewed polls because impeachments backfired on them.
[00:15:29.554 --> 00:15:36.057]  But they're going to counter strike and we're going to look at every single angle of it.
[00:15:36.057 --> 00:15:42.220]  Coming up here today and the desperate deep state plan to trigger civil unrest
[00:15:43.621 --> 00:15:46.305]  Martial law, civil war.
[00:15:46.305 --> 00:15:49.651]  And the man that predicted it all in 2003 is joining us.
[00:15:49.651 --> 00:15:55.159]  When you read what he predicted in 2003, it's all happening today with us.
[00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:02.383]  We're closing out the year 2019.
[00:16:02.383 --> 00:16:06.527]  I don't have to tell you that 2020 is going to be make it or break it.
[00:16:06.527 --> 00:16:09.791]  Not just for Infowars, not just for America, but the whole world.
[00:16:09.791 --> 00:16:15.437]  We are in a battle between the forces of globalism that want a post-human world and those that want a pro-human world.
[00:16:15.437 --> 00:16:17.880]  We're in a fight between Satan and Christ.
[00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:21.124]  And it's being played out amongst us mortals, but
[00:16:21.684 --> 00:16:23.725]  It's being directed from on high.
[00:16:23.725 --> 00:16:29.727]  And I'm just telling the listeners of this broadcast, without you, we're going to lose this fight.
[00:16:29.727 --> 00:16:34.989]  I need all of you to realize how important you are and how important InfoWars is and what we've done together.
[00:16:34.989 --> 00:16:40.670]  And to just take stock and take measure here at the end of the year and think about what you're going to do.
[00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:46.772]  Whether supporting InfoWars or buying products from us or starting your own show, just whatever you do, take action now.
[00:16:46.772 --> 00:16:47.893]  History is happening.
[00:16:48.633 --> 00:16:50.657]  Please do your Christmas shopping.

[00:17:07.614 --> 00:17:13.778]  At that critical, game-changing moment, we have come through.
[00:17:13.778 --> 00:17:23.124]  And that means myself, the other hosts, the journalists, the researchers, the writers, the crew, down to the janitor, down to the bookkeeper.
[00:17:24.325 --> 00:17:26.127]  There is no top, there is no bottom.
[00:17:26.127 --> 00:17:30.190]  We are a family in this fight, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:32.071]  And the stakes have never been higher.
[00:17:32.071 --> 00:17:34.253]  That's why the Globals want to take us out of the game.
[00:17:34.253 --> 00:17:38.156]  Only you keep InfoWars in the game.
[00:17:38.156 --> 00:17:39.697]  You are the InfoWar.

[00:17:54.288 --> 00:17:58.912]  Now's the time to shop at m4store.com.
[00:17:58.912 --> 00:18:01.675]  My fault, I fear.
[00:18:01.675 --> 00:18:07.380]  I thought that you'd want what I want.
[00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:14.707]  I'm sorry, my dear.
[00:18:14.707 --> 00:18:16.969]  But where are the clowns?
[00:18:19.682 --> 00:18:22.386]  Send in the clowns.
[00:18:30.688 --> 00:18:32.589]  The globalists have sent in the clowns.
[00:18:32.589 --> 00:18:34.369]  They've sent in Antifa.
[00:18:34.369 --> 00:18:38.390]  They've broken our borders with some of the most hardened criminals from around the world.
[00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:42.371]  They've tried to poison us with fluoride and GMO and the tainted vaccines.
[00:18:42.371 --> 00:18:44.052]  They've sent in their clowns.
[00:18:44.052 --> 00:18:49.453]  But now, the men and women of America are taking action and confronting globalists everywhere.
[00:18:49.713 --> 00:18:52.495]  And I'm so proud of InfoWars leading the charge.
[00:18:52.495 --> 00:18:58.558]  But the only way we can do that is when you keep spreading the word about our broadcast and when you keep buying the great products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:19:05.541 --> 00:19:19.667]  I've been on the air so long that I take it for granted now when we break some massive story that changes the whole world and that really does great things for the future of not just our children, but our children's children.
[00:19:19.667 --> 00:19:22.048]  Infowars really has changed history.
[00:19:22.048 --> 00:19:29.311]  And that's why I need to pull back and ask the listeners, because I know you're a lot like me, to really think about a world without Infowars.
[00:19:29.771 --> 00:19:40.037]  Because I can tell you right now, if people don't really step to the plate and really financially support our broadcast going into 2020, we're not going to be on the air in a year or so.
[00:19:40.037 --> 00:19:47.801]  If you do support us, we're not just going to stay on the air, but we are going to expand in ways that are going to blow you away.
[00:19:47.801 --> 00:19:49.242]  I've never let you down.
[00:19:49.242 --> 00:19:50.983]  You've never let me down.
[00:19:50.983 --> 00:19:52.364]  Step up to the plate now.
[00:19:52.364 --> 00:19:58.187]  Go to mfulworthstore.com, buy great products and fund our operation and watch us make history together again.
[00:20:01.741 --> 00:20:04.923]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:04.923 --> 00:20:11.686]  Monday through Friday.
[00:20:25.114 --> 00:20:26.255]  From 11 a.m.
[00:20:26.255 --> 00:20:29.416]  to 3 p.m., I'm here live.
[00:20:29.416 --> 00:20:31.037]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:20:31.037 --> 00:20:32.298]  Then I come back Sundays, live.
[00:20:32.298 --> 00:20:34.479]  4 to 6 p.m.
[00:20:34.479 --> 00:20:36.200]  Central.
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:38.801]  We have David Knight, weekday mornings, 8 a.m.
[00:20:38.801 --> 00:20:45.605]  Owen Schroer, War Room, 3 to 6 p.m., and many live shows and special events we do at night as well.
[00:20:45.605 --> 00:20:51.848]  Yesterday, I came in and did a two-hour special report from 2 to 4 p.m.
[00:20:51.848 --> 00:20:52.749]  that's posted as well.
[00:20:54.622 --> 00:21:02.946]  You know, we first broke the Jeffrey Epstein information 13, 14 years ago when he was first arrested.
[00:21:02.946 --> 00:21:09.030]  We've been tracking him and knew who he worked for and what he really represented.
[00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:13.332]  Yes, he didn't kill himself, but he also isn't the story.
[00:21:13.332 --> 00:21:16.974]  He's just an errand boy, a grocer.
[00:21:16.974 --> 00:21:21.216]  Well, tomorrow, we have
[00:21:23.584 --> 00:21:29.565]  Dr. Steve Pachinick, who was one of the founders of Delta Force, ran the Camp David Accords.
[00:21:29.565 --> 00:21:31.105]  That's how long he's been around.
[00:21:31.105 --> 00:21:34.386]  He's the character Jack Ryan and Tom Clancy's based on.
[00:21:34.386 --> 00:21:37.707]  The expert of Tom Clancy, how he knew all that secret stuff.
[00:21:37.707 --> 00:21:39.227]  That's the guy.
[00:21:39.227 --> 00:21:43.068]  He's gonna come on and reveal a lot of big secrets tomorrow.
[00:21:43.068 --> 00:21:46.868]  And then, I'm gonna tape a special show.
[00:21:46.868 --> 00:21:49.149]  Right after I go off here tomorrow.
[00:21:49.149 --> 00:21:50.269]  It's gonna go up tomorrow night.
[00:21:51.411 --> 00:21:55.915]  With all the new information about Epstein.
[00:21:55.915 --> 00:21:56.636]  And did you know?
[00:21:56.636 --> 00:22:03.562]  The stuff that was going on then is still going on with the same people.
[00:22:03.562 --> 00:22:06.184]  And we're gonna name names.
[00:22:06.184 --> 00:22:09.687]  You see, cause not everybody's cowards.
[00:22:09.687 --> 00:22:10.708]  Not everybody's fake.
[00:22:12.079 --> 00:22:14.602]  Not everybody serves Satan.
[00:22:14.602 --> 00:22:16.724]  Some people are real.
[00:22:16.724 --> 00:22:23.490]  And you as the listeners and viewers, I don't call you an audience because you're an activist.
[00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:31.699]  You've changed the world by holding this operation up when I would have collapsed a long time ago.
[00:22:31.699 --> 00:22:33.600]  You did it.
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:34.662]  It's not about credit.
[00:22:34.662 --> 00:22:35.162]  You don't want credit.
[00:22:40.151 --> 00:22:45.835]  You need to recognize who the man and the woman in the arena is.
[00:22:45.835 --> 00:22:46.615]  You may be old.
[00:22:46.615 --> 00:22:47.396]  You may be young.
[00:22:47.396 --> 00:22:48.617]  You may be a man or a woman.
[00:22:48.617 --> 00:22:50.338]  You may be a child.
[00:22:50.338 --> 00:22:51.759]  You may be on death's doorstep.
[00:22:51.759 --> 00:22:53.280]  You may have black skin.
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:54.961]  You may have white skin.
[00:22:54.961 --> 00:22:59.124]  You may have brown skin.
[00:22:59.124 --> 00:23:03.667]  You may have freckled little polka dotted skin like me.
[00:23:03.667 --> 00:23:06.429]  But you've got red blood.
[00:23:06.429 --> 00:23:07.850]  You've got that same spirit.
[00:23:07.850 --> 00:23:09.731]  You've got that same connection to God.
[00:23:12.571 --> 00:23:14.732]  And you belong.
[00:23:14.732 --> 00:23:15.873]  You belong.
[00:23:15.873 --> 00:23:17.614]  I belong.
[00:23:17.614 --> 00:23:26.339]  And we have a kinship that is infinity more complex and deeper than the color of our skin.
[00:23:26.339 --> 00:23:34.923]  It's the content of our character and our deeds that is the evidence of the light in our soul and who we serve.
[00:23:43.493 --> 00:23:53.901]  So tomorrow, I'm going to do something I should have done a year ago.
[00:23:53.901 --> 00:24:04.529]  And I didn't hold off on the latest Epstein information because I'm scared of being sued.
[00:24:04.529 --> 00:24:10.954]  I did it because at a gut level, and I always follow my gut, and in the past I didn't, I knew it wasn't time yet.
[00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:14.133]  And it isn't that I held any information back.
[00:24:14.133 --> 00:24:16.916]  A lot more has come out since then.
[00:24:16.916 --> 00:24:20.121]  It's just now is the time to act.
[00:24:20.121 --> 00:24:21.743]  I was going to wait until the new year.
[00:24:21.743 --> 00:24:29.513]  Then an investigator that I know contacted me a few days ago and he said, you know, now's the time to strike on all this.
[00:24:30.601 --> 00:24:37.825]  And I brought a bunch of this to you and I brought it to the publications, New York Post, you name it.
[00:24:37.825 --> 00:24:40.867]  And they've done nothing with it because they're scared even though it's all confirmed.
[00:24:40.867 --> 00:24:42.668]  It's not like this is speculative.
[00:24:42.668 --> 00:24:46.430]  This is cut and dry stuff.
[00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:50.092]  These are suspects, named suspects with Epstein.
[00:24:50.092 --> 00:24:54.174]  These are people that ran operations for him, were paid by him.
[00:24:54.174 --> 00:24:56.615]  And the stuff's still going on.
[00:24:56.615 --> 00:24:57.476]  And we know where and how.
[00:25:01.247 --> 00:25:10.809]  And when you're like me, you go, hey, here, FBI, here's this, or hey, you know, Wall Street Journal, Fox News.
[00:25:10.809 --> 00:25:12.470]  And I've given them all this stuff, too.
[00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:19.051]  And people say, well, why wouldn't you want to break that?
[00:25:19.051 --> 00:25:22.652]  It would take five hours to describe wisdom.
[00:25:22.652 --> 00:25:25.353]  And by wisdom, I mean each point of wisdom.
[00:25:25.353 --> 00:25:29.614]  It takes, you understand, it takes too much to go into why and how you come to weigh that.
[00:25:30.649 --> 00:25:47.554]  But a lot of it is, they knew that we were the vanguard of exposing how they use pedophilia and these other corrupt things to blackmail and take over systems, not just government, but corporate, academic, ecclesiastical.
[00:25:47.554 --> 00:25:53.036]  And so, once they demonized us on that topic,
[00:25:54.428 --> 00:26:11.208]  With the general public, if we break something big in that arena, they're automatically able to cover it up because of all the propaganda they've already laid in that, oh, Jones says there's Martian slave colonies, which I never said, or Jones got it wrong about this or that, which didn't really happen.
[00:26:14.124 --> 00:26:23.153]  But because all of this has already come out from other people, and it's exactly what I already said, now you've got to let the public realize that you were right.
[00:26:23.153 --> 00:26:29.239]  You've got to see that see change, and everybody apologize to you in the street, or at the mall, or at the DMV.
[00:26:29.239 --> 00:26:32.682]  That's your sign of when it's time to strike with the new information.
[00:26:32.682 --> 00:26:36.065]  I forget, what book of the Bible is it?
[00:26:36.065 --> 00:26:37.627]  Can you guys look it up?
[00:26:37.627 --> 00:26:38.307]  Just type in...
[00:26:41.277 --> 00:26:53.126]  Passages, verses in the Bible about a time to reap, a time to sow, a time to fight, a time for peace, a time to... But there's those times.
[00:26:53.126 --> 00:27:01.893]  And you gotta really hold your trigger finger back until you really got them dead in the
[00:27:04.005 --> 00:27:16.772]  And you just can squeeze and pull that metaphorical trigger, and you just know that bullet's gonna hit the exact spot you're aiming for, politically.
[00:27:16.772 --> 00:27:18.072]  There it is, Ecclesiastes 3, 1, 8.
[00:27:18.072 --> 00:27:25.056]  To everything there is a season and a time, to every purpose under the heaven.
[00:27:25.056 --> 00:27:26.417]  Time to be born and time to die.
[00:27:27.659 --> 00:27:31.681]  Time to plant, time to pluck up that which is planted.
[00:27:31.681 --> 00:27:35.262]  Time to kill, and a time to heal.
[00:27:35.262 --> 00:27:38.143]  Time to break down, and a time to build up.
[00:27:38.143 --> 00:27:39.744]  Time to weep, and a time to laugh.
[00:27:39.744 --> 00:27:41.985]  A time to mourn, and a time to dance.
[00:27:41.985 --> 00:27:45.427]  A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together.
[00:27:45.427 --> 00:27:48.508]  A time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing.
[00:27:49.704 --> 00:27:52.185]  This is not as pretty because it's not the King James.
[00:27:52.185 --> 00:27:54.185]  A time to get, and a time to lose.
[00:27:54.185 --> 00:27:56.686]  A time to keep, and a time to cast away.
[00:27:56.686 --> 00:27:59.687]  A time to rend, and a time to sow.
[00:27:59.687 --> 00:28:02.108]  A time to keep silence, and a time to speak.
[00:28:02.108 --> 00:28:03.668]  A time to love, and a time to hate.
[00:28:03.668 --> 00:28:07.290]  A time of war, and a time of peace.
[00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:11.151]  That's nice, but from a modern translation, not as good as the King James.
[00:28:11.151 --> 00:28:13.752]  You just might print me that from the King James, thanks.
[00:28:13.752 --> 00:28:17.993]  So, I'll get into the news, and then a very special guest when we come back.
[00:28:20.399 --> 00:28:25.863]  But now is the time to hit them with everything we've got.
[00:28:25.863 --> 00:28:34.510]  And so, I'm gonna hit the system with everything I've got in the next weeks and months.
[00:28:34.510 --> 00:28:37.633]  And it's all in God's hands.
[00:28:37.633 --> 00:28:41.215]  So I'm gonna hit them with everything I've got.
[00:28:41.215 --> 00:28:42.156]  With the truth.
[00:28:42.156 --> 00:28:42.977]  With justice.
[00:28:43.737 --> 00:28:45.238]  And I'm going with God.
[00:28:45.238 --> 00:28:47.740]  I pray that God lead, guide, and direct everything we do.
[00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:51.422]  Not just with the Sepstein announcement and information, but with all of it.
[00:28:51.422 --> 00:28:53.303]  It's time for total commitment.
[00:28:53.303 --> 00:28:54.944]  The children demand it.
[00:28:54.944 --> 00:28:56.145]  And God will have it.
[00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:10.893]  Christmas is here, and it's time to give yourself, your family, and your loved ones the gift of having incredible energy, stamina, focus, libido.
[00:29:10.893 --> 00:29:14.957]  Now, look, there are a lot of stimulants out there that'll give you that for a while, but then burn you out.
[00:29:14.957 --> 00:29:19.803]  But if you have the foundation of what your body needs, then it takes you to the next level.
[00:29:20.463 --> 00:29:21.104]  We're good to go!
[00:29:42.998 --> 00:29:49.484]  It's 65% off Real Red Pill, Real Red Pill Plus, and a free bottle of Biotris Selenium right now through Christmas.

[00:29:59.232 --> 00:30:04.036]  I'm here to give the listeners and viewers a project report in the next 60 seconds.
[00:30:04.036 --> 00:30:05.858]  And here's the bottom line.
[00:30:05.858 --> 00:30:07.299]  I'm not playing around.
[00:30:07.299 --> 00:30:08.740]  I'm not screwing around.
[00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:10.282]  I'm not joking, and neither are you.
[00:30:11.696 --> 00:30:27.008]  InfoWars and this operation we built together has delivered for America, has delivered for our children and the unborn, has delivered in the face of toxic fluoride and the GMOs and the deadly vaccine depopulation operation.
[00:30:27.008 --> 00:30:29.850]  What we're doing is beyond critical.
[00:30:29.850 --> 00:30:31.051]  And do you hear the key word?
[00:30:31.051 --> 00:30:35.474]  What we are doing is beyond critical.
[00:30:36.335 --> 00:30:50.419]  So, this is the time, with the biggest sales ever, during Christmas, at InfoWarsTour.com, to get in there and buy these products that you already need, that I need the funding for, to get this operation to the next level.
[00:30:50.419 --> 00:30:51.940]  I need the money.
[00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:54.160]  I need to be able to fight the globalists.
[00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:55.301]  I need you.
[00:30:55.301 --> 00:30:56.481]  You need these products.
[00:30:56.481 --> 00:30:58.922]  Get them at InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:30:58.922 --> 00:31:04.203]  The best product, I'm not supposed to be biased, but I'm going to tell you all now, if you haven't tried TurboForce, you need to try it.
[00:31:04.203 --> 00:31:05.544]  I've tried TurboForce with everything.
[00:31:06.928 --> 00:31:08.629]  Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy.
[00:31:08.629 --> 00:31:10.290]  I put TurboForce in my coffee.
[00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:11.230]  That was a crazy week.
[00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:22.916]  I don't remember sleeping, but as far as the products go, TurboForce is my favorite, and all the InfoWars products are down to taking control of your life, taking control of your health, and not relying on other people to do it for you.
[00:31:22.916 --> 00:31:24.237]  Nobody wakes up in the morning
[00:31:25.717 --> 00:31:28.098]  And thinks, I'm gonna give that person over there a better life.
[00:31:28.098 --> 00:31:29.498]  I'm gonna wake up today, you know what?
[00:31:29.498 --> 00:31:33.740]  I'm gonna spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier, happier, and richer.
[00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:35.981]  I'm gonna make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend.
[00:31:35.981 --> 00:31:37.481]  I don't think that happens very often.
[00:31:37.481 --> 00:31:38.281]  It's never happened to me.
[00:31:38.281 --> 00:31:41.202]  I've never had anyone knock on my door and said, Tate, you're such a good guy.
[00:31:41.202 --> 00:31:42.903]  How can I improve your life in every single way?
[00:31:43.063 --> 00:31:45.824]  There's only one person who woke up and thought that, and that was me.
[00:31:45.824 --> 00:31:53.789]  I woke up and thought, you know what, okay, I want to take control of my life, I want to take control of my health, and that's why you need to go to Infowars.com, take control of your health right now, and support the resistance.
[00:31:53.789 --> 00:31:57.111]  Don't buy into the groupthink, don't drink the Kool-Aid, drink the TurboForce.
[00:31:57.111 --> 00:31:59.212]  Kool-Aid's bad and the TurboForce is good.
[00:31:59.212 --> 00:32:02.393]  My fault, I fear.
[00:32:02.393 --> 00:32:08.297]  I thought that you'd want what I want.
[00:32:08.297 --> 00:32:12.139]  I'm sorry, my dear.
[00:32:28.295 --> 00:32:32.876]  The globalists have sent in the clowns.
[00:32:32.876 --> 00:32:34.677]  They've sent in Antifa.
[00:32:34.677 --> 00:32:38.699]  They've broken our borders with some of the most hardened criminals from around the world.
[00:32:38.699 --> 00:32:42.680]  They've tried to poison us with fluoride and GMO and the tainted vaccines.
[00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:43.921]  They've sent in their clowns.
[00:32:44.341 --> 00:32:50.006]  But now, the men and women of America are taking action and confronting globalists everywhere.
[00:32:50.006 --> 00:32:52.768]  And I'm so proud of InfoWars leading the charge.
[00:32:52.768 --> 00:33:01.695]  But the only way we can do that is when you keep spreading the word about our broadcast and when you keep buying the great products at InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:33:01.695 --> 00:33:04.318]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:26.815 --> 00:33:46.549]  The destiny of the human species and our true objective, if we choose the mission God has prepared for us, is beyond fantastic.
[00:33:46.549 --> 00:33:55.175]  Consciousness itself, the mysteries of the universe, and what we already know,
[00:33:57.168 --> 00:34:02.631]  It's so fantastical.
[00:34:02.631 --> 00:34:20.522]  But every metric and every study and every statistic shows us that we're more unhappy, more alone, more angry, and dying younger than we ever have before.
[00:34:20.522 --> 00:34:25.205]  Our babies are dying in record numbers.
[00:34:27.202 --> 00:34:29.764]  We are sick.
[00:34:29.764 --> 00:34:32.427]  We are poisoned.
[00:34:32.427 --> 00:34:36.310]  We are in the process of being destroyed.
[00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:40.153]  And our enemies admit they're doing it.
[00:34:40.153 --> 00:34:42.635]  Modern virtue is self-loathing.
[00:34:42.635 --> 00:34:47.680]  Modern virtue is inverting your life force.
[00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:49.201]  Your drive.
[00:34:49.201 --> 00:34:50.682]  Your will.
[00:34:50.682 --> 00:34:51.523]  Your potential.
[00:34:53.191 --> 00:35:00.357]  School children everywhere are taught to hate themselves and to hate their own species and that we are a cancer.
[00:35:00.357 --> 00:35:21.254]  While the very mad scientist class teaching this on a planetary scale are the ones actually endangering the very fabric of the biological genome, not just of our species, but every living thing on this planet and the interlocking multivariate
[00:35:24.602 --> 00:35:26.043]  Biospheres.
[00:35:26.043 --> 00:35:31.505]  That they are attempting to collapse in their own admissions.
[00:35:31.505 --> 00:35:33.906]  Because they're building something new.
[00:35:33.906 --> 00:35:38.287]  They're not geoengineering the planet.
[00:35:38.287 --> 00:35:45.210]  They're terraforming it.
[00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:50.052]  And I don't have a good idea what they're terraforming.
[00:35:50.052 --> 00:35:50.372]  I know.
[00:35:52.984 --> 00:35:59.206]  And in the near future, I'm going to reveal it on air with specifics.
[00:35:59.206 --> 00:36:02.828]  And how to beat it.
[00:36:02.828 --> 00:36:19.054]  And how, when you see specific things in the future that you've never even heard of, that's never been written about, you'll know whether I'm around or not.
[00:36:19.054 --> 00:36:20.975]  I'm going to lay it all out.
[00:36:28.373 --> 00:36:34.117]  What's happening on this planet is what you see behind me, if you're a TV viewer.
[00:36:34.117 --> 00:36:38.621]  Looks like Yosemite National Park.
[00:36:38.621 --> 00:36:47.207]  Or maybe it's somewhere, not in California, but maybe it's in Colorado.
[00:36:47.207 --> 00:36:49.168]  Maybe it's in Canada.
[00:36:49.168 --> 00:36:53.852]  But it's a man in a space suit, standing on the Earth.
[00:36:55.734 --> 00:37:01.838]  Why would he need a spacesuit living on his planet?
[00:37:01.838 --> 00:37:17.850]  Because if this group makes the planet uninhabitable, then what does that do?
[00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:25.355]  Well, it forces us to evolve into something that can survive on the planet.
[00:37:26.308 --> 00:37:50.806]  But why would they create a scenario like that to force us, to trick us into using our free will to believe a fulfilling, self-fulfilling prophecy?
[00:37:50.806 --> 00:37:53.327]  This is what's going on.
[00:37:53.327 --> 00:37:55.149]  This is undoubtedly what's happening right now.
[00:37:56.991 --> 00:38:03.415]  This is what the engineers admit they're doing.
[00:38:03.415 --> 00:38:04.996]  And they are not happy.
[00:38:04.996 --> 00:38:10.399]  They are not blessed people.
[00:38:10.399 --> 00:38:19.024]  They're not even being rewarded with anything real for what they're doing, except death.
[00:38:19.024 --> 00:38:22.186]  The wages of sin are death.
[00:38:22.186 --> 00:38:22.707]  What is sin?
[00:38:23.769 --> 00:38:27.613]  Violating the code of life.
[00:38:27.613 --> 00:38:29.995]  Common sense.
[00:38:29.995 --> 00:38:35.341]  Inventing evil.
[00:38:35.341 --> 00:38:42.488]  I said I'd get to the bar clip, it's up on InfoWars.com, and I said I'd get to all the other news, and I will next segment.
[00:38:42.488 --> 00:38:45.011]  But the subjects we're covering here in the main
[00:38:48.061 --> 00:38:51.542]  About the post-human world we're being taught is so great.
[00:38:51.542 --> 00:38:52.783]  That's real.
[00:38:52.783 --> 00:38:55.384]  That's out in the open.
[00:38:55.384 --> 00:39:13.890]  And now that it's all being bugled from the highest citadel, from the highest ivory tower, by these Skeksy-like globalists, that's when everyone's starting to be silenced, so that you can't raise the alarm and say that you don't submit to it.
[00:39:16.269 --> 00:39:31.259]  And there are organizations and groups in government and corporations and in life that are going to recognize this and are going to decide they care about their children and their grandchildren and a human future.
[00:39:31.259 --> 00:39:37.564]  And because the evil is intensifying, they can spiritually feel the cold death.
[00:39:37.564 --> 00:39:43.348]  And even those that have served the world so far are now finding courage to say no
[00:39:44.571 --> 00:39:49.592]  Because now you cannot deny where we're going.
[00:39:49.592 --> 00:40:00.554]  The modern controllers of this planet are taking us somewhere very, very bad.
[00:40:00.554 --> 00:40:02.995]  It's elementary.
[00:40:02.995 --> 00:40:04.235]  It's basic.
[00:40:04.235 --> 00:40:12.717]  And people like Ruth Bader Ginsburg and others are not powerful.
[00:40:14.645 --> 00:40:18.606]  They are jokes.
[00:40:18.606 --> 00:40:33.072]  But in the year 2019, the establishment is so hell-bent on making us give up our humanity and fully submit to them because the spirit that dominates them is demanding that of them.
[00:40:33.072 --> 00:40:34.772]  They're walking the plank politically.
[00:40:34.772 --> 00:40:41.915]  They're doing things that are destroying themselves individually because they're not their own men, they're not their own women, they're slaves.
[00:40:43.919 --> 00:40:47.220]  They are nothing but mouthpieces, repeaters.
[00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:51.342]  They don't have free will.
[00:40:51.342 --> 00:40:55.703]  They turned it over and then lost it.
[00:40:55.703 --> 00:41:07.188]  Only way you can lose free will is to say, with your free will, you give up your free will and then do things against your spirit and against your own programming to prove
[00:41:08.626 --> 00:41:11.468]  To this system that you've given up your humanity.
[00:41:11.468 --> 00:41:20.516]  And that's where the child molestation, the child torture, and the child sacrifice comes from.
[00:41:20.516 --> 00:41:22.577]  As your admission ticket.
[00:41:22.577 --> 00:41:25.099]  Now I told you, let's play the Michelle Wolf clip first.
[00:41:25.099 --> 00:41:28.122]  The comedian in the system force feeds everyone.
[00:41:28.122 --> 00:41:31.885]  She gets literally half a star ratings on Netflix, but they just still push her.
[00:41:34.625 --> 00:41:36.746]  And what did she say just in her latest special?
[00:41:36.746 --> 00:41:43.050]  She got a whole crowd of thousands to cheer when she said, I have power, I'm God, I enjoyed killing my baby.
[00:41:43.050 --> 00:41:48.993]  Imagine if I said, in America people cheer mothers killing their babies and say they enjoy it.
[00:41:48.993 --> 00:41:50.253]  You'd say that's crazy.
[00:41:50.253 --> 00:41:53.055]  I've told you that's what they say and now they're openly saying it.
[00:41:53.055 --> 00:41:56.817]  That's the essence of the selfishness.
[00:41:56.817 --> 00:42:02.300]  That's the essence of someone cutting themselves off from God and being given the order by the Spirit
[00:42:03.413 --> 00:42:05.875]  Of Satan to do it!
[00:42:05.875 --> 00:42:11.181]  The Holy Ghost will demand you take on evil, and stand up for innocence, and be fearless, and you will be!
[00:42:11.181 --> 00:42:18.828]  Satan turns you into a maggot, into a slave, and has you do horrible things to degrade yourself, to take you away from God!
[00:42:18.828 --> 00:42:20.830]  And these fools sign on to do it!
[00:42:20.830 --> 00:42:21.851]  And does she look happy?
[00:42:21.851 --> 00:42:23.012]  Does she look powerful?
[00:42:23.012 --> 00:42:24.533]  Does she look like... No!
[00:42:24.533 --> 00:42:26.375]  She's destroyed herself!
[00:42:26.375 --> 00:42:26.856]  Here she is!
[00:42:28.183 --> 00:42:30.964]  Well, you can feel any way you want after you get an abortion.
[00:42:30.964 --> 00:42:32.224]  Get one!
[00:42:32.224 --> 00:42:33.085]  See how you feel!
[00:42:33.085 --> 00:42:38.326]  You know how my abortion made me feel?
[00:42:38.326 --> 00:42:40.107]  Very powerful.
[00:42:40.107 --> 00:42:41.747]  You know how people say you can't play God?
[00:42:41.747 --> 00:42:52.390]  I walked out of there being like, move over Morgan Freeman!
[00:42:52.390 --> 00:42:56.292]  I am God!
[00:42:56.292 --> 00:42:57.272]  I am God.
[00:42:58.661 --> 00:43:06.827]  It's your last chance to get the original designer limited-edition Jeffrey Epstein Christmas sweater.
[00:43:06.827 --> 00:43:19.817]  The globalists are so scared of this story continuing to come out for people learning about the deep state and the international blackmail rings using kidnapped women and children to compromise world leaders.
[00:43:19.817 --> 00:43:24.060]  They do not want this story continuing and this is your last chance
[00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:32.664]  To get the limited edition Christmas sweater at InfowarsStore.com to help spread the word, to have a piece of history, and to fund our operation.
[00:43:32.664 --> 00:43:36.066]  So, again, it says, Christmas lights are a lot like Epstein.
[00:43:36.066 --> 00:43:38.707]  These things don't hang themselves on the front.
[00:43:38.707 --> 00:43:43.249]  On the back, it's got Infowars.com and shows the O in Infowars as a wreath.
[00:43:43.249 --> 00:43:44.310]  It's also a noose.
[00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:48.554]  The system can't stand it when you promote things at the grassroots level.
[00:43:48.554 --> 00:43:52.778]  They can't stand it when you fund independent, pro-America, pro-human media.
[00:43:52.778 --> 00:43:56.441]  That's why you've got to take advantage of this shirt and get it today.
[00:43:56.441 --> 00:43:57.603]  NymphoWorstore.com
[00:44:01.138 --> 00:44:03.079]  The globalists think America's done.
[00:44:03.079 --> 00:44:04.859]  The globalists think the West is done.
[00:44:04.859 --> 00:44:07.620]  They think that Christians are done and finished.
[00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:09.860]  They believe they've broken our backs.
[00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:14.801]  They believe that with big tech censorship, we'll just crawl into ditches and submit to them.
[00:44:14.801 --> 00:44:26.584]  And they believe that if they can demonize and shut down Infowars, that they rightfully see as a symbol, a beacon of populism and freedom, not just to America, but to the whole world, that they can demoralize everybody else and win.
[00:44:26.584 --> 00:44:29.305]  Why, if they can shut Infowars down, they can intimidate everybody else.
[00:44:29.745 --> 00:44:33.168]  That's why it's beyond critical that you keep InfoWars on the air.
[00:44:33.168 --> 00:44:36.810]  It's only by your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support that we're on air.
[00:44:36.810 --> 00:44:40.353]  And I want to thank you all this Christmas for your past support.
[00:44:40.353 --> 00:44:48.879]  But I want to encourage you now to redouble your efforts and financially support us by getting great products you need during the 12 days of Christmas at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:44:48.879 --> 00:44:53.343]  Massive sales, store-wide free shipping, double Patriot points.
[00:44:53.343 --> 00:44:55.184]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:44:55.184 --> 00:44:56.285]  Please take action now.
[00:44:56.285 --> 00:44:57.786]  George Soros hopes you don't.
[00:44:58.908 --> 00:45:04.554]  My fault, I fear.
[00:45:04.554 --> 00:45:07.937]  I thought that you'd want what I want.
[00:45:07.937 --> 00:45:14.604]  I'm sorry, my dear.
[00:45:14.604 --> 00:45:16.867]  But where are the clowns?
[00:45:21.552 --> 00:45:32.517]  The globalists have sent in the clowns.
[00:45:32.517 --> 00:45:34.318]  They've sent in Antifa.
[00:45:34.318 --> 00:45:38.340]  They've broken our borders with some of the most hardened criminals from around the world.
[00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:42.321]  They've tried to poison us with fluoride and GMO and the tainted vaccines.
[00:45:42.321 --> 00:45:43.582]  They've sent in their clowns.
[00:45:43.982 --> 00:45:49.666]  But now, the men and women of America are taking action and confronting globalists everywhere.
[00:45:49.666 --> 00:45:52.148]  And I'm so proud of InfoWars leading the charge.
[00:45:52.148 --> 00:45:59.533]  But the only way we can do that is when you keep spreading the word about our broadcast and when you keep buying the great products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:45:59.533 --> 00:46:01.755]  InfoWars has delivered.
[00:46:02.944 --> 00:46:08.386]  InfoWars has come through time and time and time and time again.
[00:46:08.386 --> 00:46:14.529]  At that critical, game-changing moment, we have come through.
[00:46:14.529 --> 00:46:23.873]  And that means myself, the other hosts, the journalists, the researchers, the writers, the crew, down to the janitor, down to the bookkeeper.
[00:46:25.093 --> 00:46:26.895]  There is no top, there is no bottom.
[00:46:26.895 --> 00:46:30.938]  We are a family in this fight, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:46:30.938 --> 00:46:32.840]  And the stakes have never been higher.
[00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:35.022]  That's why the Globals want to take us out of the game.
[00:46:35.022 --> 00:46:38.925]  Only you keep InfoWars in the game.
[00:46:38.925 --> 00:46:40.447]  You are the InfoWar.
[00:46:40.447 --> 00:46:41.528]  And now, this Christmas,
[00:46:42.068 --> 00:46:53.938]  And coming up to the end of the year is the time to spend your money at infowarestore.com to fund us into this next critical year of 2020 while getting great products that make your life and your family's life a lot better.
[00:46:53.938 --> 00:46:55.359]  Huge sales right now.

[00:47:01.704 --> 00:47:04.346]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:15.553 --> 00:47:17.394]  December 22nd, 2019.
[00:47:17.394 --> 00:47:23.356]  The great year foretold.
[00:47:23.356 --> 00:47:24.856]  The year 2020.
[00:47:24.856 --> 00:47:27.797]  It's iconography.
[00:47:27.797 --> 00:47:28.297]  It's symbolism.
[00:47:44.837 --> 00:47:47.878]  Unmistakable.
[00:47:47.878 --> 00:47:49.959]  Vision.
[00:47:49.959 --> 00:47:55.382]  The year the vision begins.
[00:47:55.382 --> 00:48:00.704]  The year the great crisis begins to unfold.
[00:48:00.704 --> 00:48:04.705]  Lasting decades.
[00:48:04.705 --> 00:48:07.927]  Finally, the great war coming.
[00:48:07.927 --> 00:48:12.869]  The war between humanity and the dark magicians and their AI systems.
[00:48:17.962 --> 00:48:23.563]  Satan will be physically manifest upon the Earth.
[00:48:23.563 --> 00:48:30.525]  Child sacrifice will be transmitted globally.
[00:48:30.525 --> 00:48:38.146]  A full assault will be witnessed.
[00:48:38.146 --> 00:48:40.007]  But that's just a book written 2,000 years ago.
[00:48:46.715 --> 00:48:53.820]  But the same group, and organizations running things then, is in command now.
[00:48:53.820 --> 00:48:56.622]  And it's all unfolding just as it was foretold.
[00:48:56.622 --> 00:49:05.729]  But still the fools sign on.
[00:49:05.729 --> 00:49:09.792]  Buying their lottery ticket from Satan.
[00:49:09.792 --> 00:49:14.456]  And if they win, will they just get destroyed faster?
[00:49:19.489 --> 00:49:31.012]  But this is all about testing the people, and all about us having our free will, on a little planet, with baby powers, before we're given real power.
[00:49:31.012 --> 00:49:33.412]  That's how the universe works, isn't it?
[00:49:33.412 --> 00:49:36.153]  And we all know that, and everybody knows it deep down.
[00:49:38.305 --> 00:50:03.486]  And a lot of people just say, no, I think this is all there is, and so I choose to be a horrible, mean, stinking person, and then for some reason carry out these exact same rituals that humans who didn't even know each other all over the world, magically from the beginning of recorded history, engage in, and every culture says they do it because beings from the stars tell them to do it if they're to be given advanced knowledge.
[00:50:06.377 --> 00:50:16.342]  But really, we're just being taught evil and how to kill each other, and how to put really sick, bad people in power, so that we never make it as a species.
[00:50:16.342 --> 00:50:20.644]  A transmission of, here's how you load the gun, put your head and pull the trigger.
[00:50:20.644 --> 00:50:21.684]  Kill yourself.
[00:50:21.684 --> 00:50:22.845]  Kill, steal, and destroy.
[00:50:22.845 --> 00:50:23.405]  Kill.
[00:50:23.405 --> 00:50:23.985]  Kill.
[00:50:23.985 --> 00:50:24.526]  Die.
[00:50:24.526 --> 00:50:25.066]  Die.
[00:50:25.066 --> 00:50:25.626]  Die.
[00:50:25.626 --> 00:50:26.066]  Die.
[00:50:26.066 --> 00:50:27.127]  Mothers and fathers are bad.
[00:50:27.127 --> 00:50:27.867]  Abort your babies.
[00:50:27.867 --> 00:50:28.788]  Kill them after they're born.
[00:50:28.788 --> 00:50:29.328]  Hail Satan.
[00:50:32.196 --> 00:50:33.497]  All right, let's get into it.
[00:50:33.497 --> 00:50:39.281]  Then we'll get into the temporal information and Matt Bracken that wrote this article in 2003.
[00:50:39.281 --> 00:50:44.105]  That's now, I was rereading it, people said, you gotta read this.
[00:50:44.105 --> 00:50:46.167]  We reposted it on fullwars.com.
[00:50:46.167 --> 00:50:50.170]  Virginia checkpoints, what could possibly go wrong?
[00:50:50.170 --> 00:50:56.695]  He wrote this back in 2003, the plan to cause martial law in Virginia.
[00:50:56.695 --> 00:51:01.739]  And it talks about a governor coming for guns, walking down the roads, doing exactly what Governor Northam
[00:51:03.695 --> 00:51:23.112]  When he's not talking about keeping babies alive and selling their organs, when he's not dressed up in KKK outfits or blackface, yes, that governor, keep the baby comfortable, that same guy, he says, and they've publicly said they're going to try to confiscate the guns using the military, and the military said we're not going to do that.
[00:51:23.112 --> 00:51:27.436]  So that's coming up with Matt Bracken and how they intend to derail Trump, because look at these headlines.
[00:51:29.167 --> 00:51:34.030]  Even CNN poll finds massive movement towards the presidents and the booming economy.
[00:51:34.030 --> 00:51:36.172]  It's backfired.
[00:51:36.172 --> 00:51:38.113]  The year socialism became a dirty word again.
[00:51:38.113 --> 00:51:41.776]  Bloomberg, all over the world, populism is rising and people hate.
[00:51:44.246 --> 00:51:47.587]  Communism, Socialism, Globalism, and George Soros.
[00:51:47.587 --> 00:51:49.087]  It's just terrible.
[00:51:49.087 --> 00:51:52.168]  And all that censorship only made people madder.
[00:51:52.168 --> 00:51:56.229]  How Trump is filling the 9th Circuit with conservatives.
[00:51:56.229 --> 00:51:58.130]  It just goes on and on, doesn't it?
[00:51:58.130 --> 00:52:00.411]  Worse and worse for them.
[00:52:00.411 --> 00:52:01.311]  And then this.
[00:52:01.311 --> 00:52:04.592]  AG Barr, Soros-funded dim prosecutor candidates.
[00:52:06.069 --> 00:52:10.110]  Will lead to increased crime, fewer police officers, which is the plan.
[00:52:10.110 --> 00:52:18.172]  Break down the society and get extra funds from the outside red state areas to fund the criminal operation.
[00:52:18.172 --> 00:52:23.693]  Just like Soros likes to collapse other countries' currencies and then have Marshall plans backed up by the U.S.
[00:52:23.693 --> 00:52:26.634]  to go in and build them back up, like he's done in Ukraine.
[00:52:26.634 --> 00:52:32.335]  You bring them down, you go in, and you build them back up, but with you owning it and controlling it.
[00:52:33.669 --> 00:52:34.451]  Just like the U.S.
[00:52:34.451 --> 00:52:36.134]  did to Europe at the end of World War II.
[00:52:36.134 --> 00:52:37.897]  But it's the globalists doing it.
[00:52:37.897 --> 00:52:42.186]  So here is the Attorney General calling out Soros.
[00:52:42.186 --> 00:52:42.506]  Here it is.
[00:52:43.456 --> 00:52:50.303]  You talked in your piece about social justice DAs, and you put social justice in quotes.
[00:52:50.303 --> 00:52:51.284]  What do you mean by that?
[00:52:51.284 --> 00:52:53.487]  What does that mean, social justice DAs?
[00:52:53.487 --> 00:53:03.617]  Well, there's been this recent development where George Soros has been coming in largely in Democratic primaries where there's not going to be much voter
[00:53:04.318 --> 00:53:30.328]  turnout and putting in a lot of money to elect people who are not very supportive of law enforcement and don't view the office as bringing to trial and prosecuting criminals but pursuing other social agendas and they have started to win in a number of cities and they have, in my view, not given the proper support to the police
[00:53:31.608 --> 00:53:39.752]  And they're following policies that are ultimately going to lead to an increase in violent crime and more victims.
[00:53:39.752 --> 00:53:57.581]  Breakdown of civilization, but when you have the famous Weatherman's son who says he won't prosecute, you know, attacking, you know, when Andy attacks innocent people, they want the breakdown of society, that they won't prosecute car theft.
[00:53:58.274 --> 00:53:59.335]  They won't even investigate it.
[00:53:59.335 --> 00:54:00.937]  Well, I mean, that legalizes car theft.
[00:54:00.937 --> 00:54:03.920]  And then the Democrats get their cut of the chop shops with MS-13.
[00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:06.102]  That's the breakdown of civilization.
[00:54:06.102 --> 00:54:11.027]  And here's the article we put out 23 months ago.
[00:54:11.027 --> 00:54:17.194]  Documents that tell plan for civil unrest and martial law in Baltimore with George Soros' son, Democrats
[00:54:19.741 --> 00:54:29.926]  And other organizations working together through Friends of Democracy to stage riots to attempt to get urban black populations to attack white people and have a race war.
[00:54:29.926 --> 00:54:31.847]  It's all in there with the documents.
[00:54:31.847 --> 00:54:39.491]  This is all illegal, but it's their plan, and it's still all on going.
[00:54:39.491 --> 00:54:42.172]  So when you see the Attorney General come out and say things like this,
[00:54:46.758 --> 00:54:49.580]  It's just another sign of where they're going, and I've got these articles right here.
[00:54:49.580 --> 00:54:51.282]  Look at this article out of Reuters.
[00:54:51.282 --> 00:54:51.522]  U.S.
[00:54:51.522 --> 00:54:55.666]  Attorney General says big tech probes to be completed next year.
[00:54:55.666 --> 00:54:57.407]  He says it needs to be done very, very soon.
[00:54:57.407 --> 00:54:58.708]  Fisher cut bait.
[00:54:58.708 --> 00:55:08.416]  Then he goes on to say that the Justice Department review was not limited to antitrust, but to looking for anti-competitive behavior front and center.
[00:55:08.416 --> 00:55:10.158]  And they go on to say looking at crimes.
[00:55:12.432 --> 00:55:15.853]  So they're not just looking at antitrust.
[00:55:15.853 --> 00:55:17.933]  So that is a very, very good deal.
[00:55:17.933 --> 00:55:22.674]  And Tucker Carlson had an excellent piece showing how the neocon think tanks are behind all the censorship.
[00:55:22.674 --> 00:55:32.976]  As I told you two years ago, they even bragged about it in the Wall Street Journal, that once they took me off the air or off the internet, they thought you wouldn't fight for me, the general public wouldn't, and then they'd have the precedent for everybody.
[00:55:32.976 --> 00:55:34.437]  Tucker Carlson got all the documents.
[00:55:34.437 --> 00:55:35.417]  It's an incredible report.
[00:55:35.417 --> 00:55:35.997]  We're going to air it.
[00:55:36.790 --> 00:55:43.711]  At the end of the show today, but it's on Infowars.com, Tucker Carlson exposes DC conservatives for doing big text bidding.
[00:55:43.711 --> 00:55:45.672]  It's a little deeper than that.
[00:55:45.672 --> 00:55:47.672]  We're going to look at all of that coming up.
[00:55:47.672 --> 00:55:55.694]  But I already played this clip during the week, but here he is also talking about Comey being a liar, that he's not involved in all this illegal activity.
[00:55:55.694 --> 00:55:59.795]  Remember, Comey first said that, oh, the IG report absolved him and there was no spying.
[00:55:59.795 --> 00:56:01.475]  It says they illegally spied in the report.
[00:56:03.254 --> 00:56:07.920]  But he just tried to say, oh, oh, but then now he's like, oh, I didn't know that was going on.
[00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:09.502]  Just seeing how dumb you are.
[00:56:09.502 --> 00:56:11.164]  Now he's finding out you're not dumb.
[00:56:11.164 --> 00:56:12.485]  So he's backtracking.
[00:56:12.485 --> 00:56:14.247]  The rats are beginning to leave the sinking ship.
[00:56:14.247 --> 00:56:15.529]  This is exciting.
[00:56:15.529 --> 00:56:16.210]  Here's what he had to say.
[00:56:16.894 --> 00:56:20.555]  He said, I was seven steps removed from what was going on.
[00:56:20.555 --> 00:56:25.055]  The director doesn't get involved in these kinds of things, the actual investigation.
[00:56:25.055 --> 00:56:26.076]  Do you believe that?
[00:56:26.076 --> 00:56:27.836]  No.
[00:56:27.836 --> 00:56:43.019]  I think that one of the problems with what happened was precisely that they pulled the investigation up to the executive floors and it was run and bird-dogged by a very small group of very high-level officials.
[00:56:43.019 --> 00:56:44.719]  And the idea that this was seven layers
[00:56:45.319 --> 00:56:47.102]  Below him is simply not true.
[00:56:47.102 --> 00:56:54.271]  We're gonna go to break and we're gonna come back with Matt Bracken and the globalist plan to grab victory from the jaws of defeat.
[00:56:55.086 --> 00:56:55.806]  And so much more.
[00:56:55.806 --> 00:56:58.288]  Remember, they don't want this information out there.
[00:56:58.288 --> 00:56:59.049]  We've got their number.
[00:56:59.049 --> 00:57:02.471]  The only reason we're on air is you spreading the word and supporting our local affiliates.
[00:57:02.471 --> 00:57:04.372]  And also buy the products at InfoWarshaw.com.

[00:57:19.241 --> 00:57:20.222]  Other systems.
[00:57:20.222 --> 00:57:21.583]  One day, two day.
[00:57:21.583 --> 00:57:23.265]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:57:23.265 --> 00:57:24.966]  Biggest sales of the year right now.

[00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:43.022]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:57:43.022 --> 00:57:44.123]  We'll be back with the second hour.
[00:57:44.123 --> 00:57:44.624]  Please stay with us.
[00:57:48.405 --> 00:57:55.254]  At current sales rates, we're going to sell out of Real Red Pill and Real Red Pill Plus by the end of the year.
[00:57:55.254 --> 00:58:06.509]  But despite that, I'm still offering it at 65% off for those of you that have never experienced what is in the Real Red Pill and in the Real Red Pill Plus.
[00:58:07.069 --> 00:58:12.535]  There is no one formula that you're going to find out there that is more game-changing.
[00:58:12.535 --> 00:58:14.998]  It's 65% off right now.
[00:58:14.998 --> 00:58:21.045]  That's very close to cost with a free bottle of our best-selling BioTrue Selenium for the mustard seed.
[00:58:21.045 --> 00:58:21.886]  These two formulas
[00:58:21.886 --> 00:58:22.186]  Thank you.
[00:58:48.956 --> 00:58:53.765]  I'm here to give the listeners and viewers a project report in the next 60 seconds.
[00:58:53.765 --> 00:58:55.588]  And here's the bottom line.
[00:58:55.588 --> 00:58:57.031]  I'm not playing around.
[00:58:57.031 --> 00:58:58.473]  I'm not screwing around.
[00:58:58.473 --> 00:59:00.016]  I'm not joking, and neither are you.
[00:59:01.443 --> 00:59:16.753]  InfoWars and this operation we built together has delivered for America, has delivered for our children and the unborn, has delivered in the face of toxic fluoride and the GMOs and the deadly vaccine depopulation operation.
[00:59:16.753 --> 00:59:19.575]  What we're doing is beyond critical.
[00:59:19.575 --> 00:59:20.796]  And do you hear the key word?
[00:59:20.796 --> 00:59:25.219]  What we are doing is beyond critical.

[00:59:51.143 --> 00:59:53.764]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:03.937 --> 01:00:13.720]  I'm always thanking the listeners, the viewers, for supporting us and keeping us on air.
[01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:16.541]  Because we're all in this together.
[01:00:16.541 --> 01:00:21.923]  But, you know, somebody we don't thank enough is not just God, obviously.
[01:00:21.923 --> 01:00:22.943]  God's the reason for everything.
[01:00:26.018 --> 01:00:28.060]  The maker.
[01:00:28.060 --> 01:00:46.635]  But our ancestors and our folks and the people that believed in freedom and justice and that carved it out of really barbarous times so that we could be here today and have free speech enshrined and have the Second Amendment enshrined.
[01:00:46.635 --> 01:00:50.599]  They didn't give us those rights, but they said we cherished them and that we'd defend them.
[01:00:53.607 --> 01:00:58.773]  They just want us to forget about all that and forget about mothers loving their babies.
[01:00:58.773 --> 01:01:04.179]  They want us to forget about men being strong and standing up for what's right.
[01:01:04.179 --> 01:01:06.681]  Got Matt Bracken joining us.
[01:01:06.681 --> 01:01:10.265]  Yeah, they say a prophet's not known in his own country.
[01:01:10.265 --> 01:01:12.928]  He's always been coming on the air for, I don't know, a long time.
[01:01:12.928 --> 01:01:14.430]  He's always, you ought to read this book I wrote.
[01:01:14.430 --> 01:01:15.251]  And I've read some of his books.
[01:01:16.527 --> 01:01:20.230]  You ought to read this stuff I wrote back in 2003.
[01:01:20.230 --> 01:01:28.378]  Finally, Mike Adams sent me an excerpt of it last night, and I read it, and I'm like, my God, that's exactly what's happening in Virginia.
[01:01:28.378 --> 01:01:30.439]  He predicted the very scenario they're following.
[01:01:30.439 --> 01:01:32.862]  Now, they may have read his book and actually used it.
[01:01:32.862 --> 01:01:36.365]  That's something criminal groups will do, is they'll use a book as a scenario so they get caught with it.
[01:01:36.365 --> 01:01:37.946]  Oh, it's just a book.
[01:01:37.946 --> 01:01:38.907]  There's a lot of cases of that.
[01:01:42.145 --> 01:01:43.486]  They've got some tricks up their sleeves.
[01:01:43.486 --> 01:01:45.947]  They are being routed right now, which is what makes them so dangerous.
[01:01:45.947 --> 01:01:49.369]  Until Matt Bracken joins us.
[01:01:49.369 --> 01:01:57.574]  Then there's all this other... There's information I haven't hit in the big Epstein news we're going to bring out tomorrow.
[01:01:57.574 --> 01:02:01.757]  That is very, very obviously important.
[01:02:01.757 --> 01:02:05.279]  And why it's been suppressed, that's a whole other story that feeds into all of this.
[01:02:05.279 --> 01:02:07.941]  But I wanted to play this again because we only played part of it.
[01:02:09.565 --> 01:02:28.559]  I've got a three-minute compilation, a four-minute compilation, a five-minute compilation, and some of the clips are in all the compilations, some of them aren't, but there's so many new clips of the talking point that it's wonderful to kill babies and women should do it to empower themselves and those little bastards need to be sliced up and their body parts sold and women need to do it.
[01:02:30.632 --> 01:02:32.733]  They even have actresses claiming they're getting abortions.
[01:02:32.733 --> 01:02:34.593]  It turns out they're actresses and it's fake.
[01:02:34.593 --> 01:02:35.714]  And going, ooh, it feels good.
[01:02:35.714 --> 01:02:36.294]  I enjoy that.
[01:02:36.294 --> 01:02:36.874]  It's sexual.
[01:02:36.874 --> 01:02:38.435]  Oh, that feels so good.
[01:02:38.435 --> 01:02:40.435]  While they're supposedly getting one.
[01:02:40.435 --> 01:02:43.176]  This is real evil.
[01:02:43.176 --> 01:02:43.856]  It's blasphemy.
[01:02:43.856 --> 01:02:51.719]  It's just taking, you know, the beauty of women and loving their babies and being wonderful creatures and a little nest for the baby and turning it into something ugly.
[01:02:53.792 --> 01:03:03.355]  I mean, just imagine, though, if I came up with a headline, you're gonna see an auditorium of a couple thousand people cheer a mother saying she felt like God killing her child.
[01:03:03.355 --> 01:03:10.137]  Usually they'd say, oh, it's not a child, because of 3D, they know everybody knows it's a child, sucking its thumb, you know, at three months old and all that.
[01:03:10.137 --> 01:03:11.398]  And singing and hopping around.
[01:03:11.398 --> 01:03:17.039]  In their little, you know, universe.
[01:03:17.039 --> 01:03:18.940]  That you just raid and destroy that whole future.
[01:03:20.014 --> 01:03:22.056]  That callousness as if any of us are safe.
[01:03:22.056 --> 01:03:25.038]  We do that to our most vulnerable.
[01:03:25.038 --> 01:03:26.840]  That's the spirit of this thing.
[01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:33.105]  What you do to the least of these, you've done to me.
[01:03:33.105 --> 01:03:34.166]  As Christ said.
[01:03:34.166 --> 01:03:34.827]  It's all right there.
[01:03:34.827 --> 01:03:40.412]  It's prima facie.
[01:03:40.412 --> 01:03:43.674]  And now they're just everywhere saying, it's religious.
[01:03:43.674 --> 01:03:44.175]  Do it.
[01:03:44.175 --> 01:03:45.216]  You'll feel great.
[01:03:45.216 --> 01:03:46.617]  Kill your children.
[01:03:48.328 --> 01:03:51.732]  And Whoopi Goldberg and all these, you know, gross taxis.
[01:03:51.732 --> 01:03:53.113]  Get out of my vagina!
[01:03:53.113 --> 01:03:54.815]  You're the one that put it there.
[01:03:54.815 --> 01:03:56.156]  And now you're gonna kill it.
[01:03:56.156 --> 01:03:58.138]  But instead, it's now a sacrament.
[01:03:58.138 --> 01:04:00.040]  Here it is.
[01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:01.562]  Get out of my behind!
[01:04:01.562 --> 01:04:02.303]  Get out of my vagina!
[01:04:02.303 --> 01:04:04.084]  Get out!
[01:04:04.084 --> 01:04:04.425]  Believe me.
[01:04:05.077 --> 01:04:06.938]  Let's talk about abortion in a real way.
[01:04:06.938 --> 01:04:10.280]  We talk about it in a very legislative way, but not in a real way.
[01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:14.303]  So I think a lot of women have a lot of apprehension surrounding it.
[01:04:14.303 --> 01:04:20.787]  You know, we talk about it so negatively that you feel like you should have this sense of shame after you get an abortion.
[01:04:20.787 --> 01:04:23.588]  Well, you can feel any way you want after you get an abortion.
[01:04:23.588 --> 01:04:24.869]  Get one!
[01:04:24.869 --> 01:04:28.251]  See how you feel!
[01:04:28.251 --> 01:04:30.973]  You know how my abortion made me feel?
[01:04:30.973 --> 01:04:32.734]  Very powerful.
[01:04:32.734 --> 01:04:34.355]  You know how people say you can't play God?
[01:04:41.477 --> 01:04:47.586]  I walked out of there being like, move over Morgan Freeman, I am God!
[01:04:47.586 --> 01:04:50.490]  Don't knock it till you try it.
[01:04:50.490 --> 01:04:52.994]  And when you do try it, really knock it.
[01:04:52.994 --> 01:04:54.817]  You know, you gotta get that baby out of there.
[01:05:00.562 --> 01:05:02.202]  Owl Killer in New Jersey.
[01:05:02.202 --> 01:05:02.762]  You're on the air.
[01:05:02.762 --> 01:05:03.343]  Go ahead.
[01:05:03.343 --> 01:05:06.123]  Alex, hey, I just want to say it's great to be back once again.
[01:05:06.123 --> 01:05:09.204]  And I've never gotten to do this, but I'm going to give you a shout out for your product.
[01:05:09.204 --> 01:05:14.465]  So that Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste and that Super Blue Whitening Toothpaste is on another level.
[01:05:14.465 --> 01:05:19.626]  I use the one I use the Super Blue in the morning and then the whitening at night and it absorbs into your gum.
[01:05:19.626 --> 01:05:22.446]  It is by far the best product I've ever used in my life.
[01:05:22.446 --> 01:05:25.087]  I literally just took turbo force on my way to the gym right now.
[01:05:25.307 --> 01:05:33.389]  I've had four shoulder surgeries and a back surgery, and that body has made me feel better than any type of physical therapy or anything that I've ever done in my life.
[01:05:33.389 --> 01:05:34.729]  So I just want to get that out of the way.
[01:05:34.729 --> 01:05:35.669]  Support this man.
[01:05:35.669 --> 01:05:37.150]  Everything that he exposed.
[01:05:37.150 --> 01:05:38.570]  Nobody knew about Bohemian Grove.
[01:05:38.570 --> 01:05:39.690]  Nobody knew about Epstein.
[01:05:39.690 --> 01:05:40.991]  Nobody knew about Bilderberg.
[01:05:40.991 --> 01:05:43.831]  Nobody called 9-11 before it happened in July 2001.
[01:05:43.831 --> 01:05:45.492]  Go look it up yourself.
[01:05:45.492 --> 01:05:46.652]  Well, we try our best, sir.
[01:05:46.652 --> 01:05:47.872]  They definitely want us off the air.
[01:05:47.872 --> 01:05:48.772]  Without you, we're not here.
[01:05:48.772 --> 01:05:50.673]  But yeah, these are all great products, so thank you, sir.
[01:06:00.009 --> 01:06:02.690]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:02.690 --> 01:06:11.172]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:06:11.172 --> 01:06:12.252]  Well, it's official.
[01:06:12.252 --> 01:06:20.815]  Democrat talking points now are that it's fun to kill babies because it makes women powerful and makes them feel like God.
[01:06:20.815 --> 01:06:25.096]  That is 100% what happens at child sacrifice and why Satanists do it.
[01:06:26.365 --> 01:06:40.749]  Again, that's so well known in literature, in history, in art, that when George Lucas wrote Episode 3 of Star Wars, Emperor Palpatine tells Darth Vader, I want you to go kill several hundred children.
[01:06:40.749 --> 01:06:43.509]  You will not be a Sith until you've done that.
[01:06:43.509 --> 01:06:46.870]  To make your journey to the dark side complete, you must go kill children.
[01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:49.731]  Do what must be done, Lord Vader.
[01:06:51.946 --> 01:06:54.947]  Go to the Jedi Temple and kill all the younglings.
[01:06:54.947 --> 01:07:01.588]  Only then will you be strong enough in the dark side and your journey will be complete.
[01:07:01.588 --> 01:07:11.369]  But now you can watch The View, and you can watch CNN, and you can watch Comedy Central, and it's like, God, I really enjoyed killing my baby.
[01:07:11.369 --> 01:07:13.850]  I felt so good.
[01:07:13.850 --> 01:07:18.030]  And I can play the Cleptual Woman and go, oh, God, it's so sexually pleasurable.
[01:07:18.030 --> 01:07:20.991]  Oh, I had a huge orgasm when they killed it.
[01:07:22.398 --> 01:07:23.219]  Of course, it's not true.
[01:07:23.219 --> 01:07:26.661]  Turned out she was an actress.
[01:07:26.661 --> 01:07:29.543]  But that was put on HBO.
[01:07:29.543 --> 01:07:33.086]  As a woman's, just a woman going, come on, uh, uh, yeah, uh, uh, uh.
[01:07:33.086 --> 01:07:48.298]  To the people that go, well, God, this sounds like a wonder, and it's a big thing online, Paul Watson's written about it in feminist magazines, the sexual pleasure of killing your child.
[01:07:50.077 --> 01:07:58.200]  And now the women go, you're right, it's not a fetus, it's a baby, and I'm gonna have them pour acid into my womb and burn it to death.
[01:07:58.200 --> 01:07:59.201]  I don't want it to hurt.
[01:07:59.201 --> 01:08:01.802]  You want me to play the clips for you?
[01:08:01.802 --> 01:08:03.523]  Because I got power.
[01:08:03.523 --> 01:08:04.843]  Wow!
[01:08:04.843 --> 01:08:07.784]  Can you imagine the spirit attached to those women?
[01:08:07.784 --> 01:08:08.665]  Can you imagine?
[01:08:10.965 --> 01:08:20.372]  If you saw Jeffrey Dahmer standing over some 14 year old he grabbed out of the street injecting boat cleaner acid into their brains because he wanted them to be zombies so he could have sex with them.
[01:08:20.372 --> 01:08:22.253]  Some of them lived up to a week.
[01:08:22.253 --> 01:08:24.594]  You'd go, this is horrible!
[01:08:24.594 --> 01:08:29.038]  He just wanted love with somebody though because no one wanted to be with him.
[01:08:29.038 --> 01:08:29.578]  He was horrible.
[01:08:31.789 --> 01:08:33.811]  He wanted somebody that would do what he said.
[01:08:33.811 --> 01:08:35.232]  He wanted power.
[01:08:35.232 --> 01:08:36.593]  He called that love.
[01:08:36.593 --> 01:08:47.281]  And would lure young men and underage boys into his apartment where he would torture them to death.
[01:08:47.281 --> 01:08:51.845]  But when a mother gets up and gets that gleam in her eye and goes, man, it felt good.
[01:08:54.667 --> 01:09:06.415]  Imagine somebody walked up to Michelle Wolfe on the street, pulled out a big old double-edged dagger, and I'm not saying do this, because I'm not like her, and just said, you know what, I feel powerful, and just slit her throat.
[01:09:06.415 --> 01:09:14.460]  And she's like, wow, I feel powerful!
[01:09:14.460 --> 01:09:20.804]  It'd be all over the news, oh my God, terrorist attack, right wing, my God, she just said she loves killing her baby and got off on it.
[01:09:23.490 --> 01:09:28.415]  They're just getting you ready, burning out your instinct to resist this, just everywhere.
[01:09:28.415 --> 01:09:37.364]  Vice, and HBO, and The New York Times, and Salon, all promoting pedophilia, everywhere!
[01:09:37.364 --> 01:09:40.647]  And Charleston Elders, same program, 1993.
[01:09:40.647 --> 01:09:41.168]  Gets into office, 1994.
[01:09:41.168 --> 01:09:42.669]  Surgeon General.
[01:09:42.669 --> 01:09:42.849]  She says,
[01:09:48.254 --> 01:09:50.915]  You need to help the children in kindergarten.
[01:09:50.915 --> 01:09:55.797]  Teachers need to reach down and help them masturbate.
[01:09:55.797 --> 01:10:05.061]  A gross, sickening, evil person from the state saying, I want to ejaculate, or your little girl or little boy, something.
[01:10:05.061 --> 01:10:07.662]  If a parent did it, they'd be arrested and should be.
[01:10:07.662 --> 01:10:13.204]  But the state wants the power to ruin their innocence and abuse your children.
[01:10:13.204 --> 01:10:15.425]  And they go, well, it's a black lady, so it's OK, right?
[01:10:16.963 --> 01:10:18.324]  And she talks like this.
[01:10:18.324 --> 01:10:19.525]  You wanna play the clip?
[01:10:19.525 --> 01:10:21.346]  Reach down and help them.
[01:10:21.346 --> 01:10:22.506]  And now it's all over the news.
[01:10:22.506 --> 01:10:25.628]  Europe's doing it!
[01:10:25.628 --> 01:10:32.552]  And when it turns out thousands of girls as young as 8 are grabbed and put into sex slavery by Muslims, the media says, if you report it's Muslims, you're arrested.
[01:10:32.552 --> 01:10:34.533]  And then some articles go, well, these young girls are lucky.
[01:10:34.533 --> 01:10:36.054]  They're learning a profession.
[01:10:36.054 --> 01:10:37.695]  The left makes jokes about it.
[01:10:37.695 --> 01:10:40.377]  Would they make a joke about it if you drove ice picks into their eyes?
[01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:54.424]  We're going to go to break in a moment, come back with Matt Bracken for two segments in the last segment.
[01:10:54.424 --> 01:11:02.350]  Tucker Carlson and the move against big tech is imminent if they'll just pull the trigger, but they're lock and loaded.
[01:11:02.350 --> 01:11:07.353]  So a lot of planets are aligning politically, economically, culturally, but the globalists know they're losing.
[01:11:07.353 --> 01:11:08.975]  They're going to pull something big.
[01:11:08.975 --> 01:11:15.460]  And Matt Bracken foresaw it 17 years ago, 16 years and change.
[01:11:15.460 --> 01:11:17.161]  He's joining us next segment.
[01:11:18.643 --> 01:11:23.252]  But if he just joins us, again, I'm not going to play the five-minute and three-minute compilations of all this.
[01:11:24.130 --> 01:11:39.678]  In fact, I'm remembering compilations that we haven't even played in a while where women say they have orgasms and that they like to get pregnant with their boyfriend because they like to kill babies and have the power over babies.
[01:11:39.678 --> 01:11:43.039]  And that it really turns them on to feel the baby kick.
[01:11:43.039 --> 01:11:46.401]  I mean, these people are sick, sick, sick, folks.
[01:11:46.401 --> 01:11:48.822]  And I know you're tuning in and going, man, is this really going on?
[01:11:48.822 --> 01:11:49.943]  Yeah, it's going on.
[01:11:49.943 --> 01:11:52.044]  It's a total celebration of evil.
[01:11:55.137 --> 01:12:04.019]  And remember, Michelle Wolf and all these other, quote, female comics that go out there and attack families, attack women, attack children.
[01:12:04.019 --> 01:12:08.940]  They even have to take the stars off on Netflix in places because they'll get half a star out of five.
[01:12:08.940 --> 01:12:10.020]  People are rejecting this.
[01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:10.840]  It's not getting ratings.
[01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:11.621]  They don't like it.
[01:12:11.621 --> 01:12:15.401]  But still, it doesn't matter.
[01:12:15.401 --> 01:12:21.503]  The image of a mother, the Madonna, is someone that wipes their ass with their own child.
[01:12:21.503 --> 01:12:22.883]  That tortures their child to death.
[01:12:25.162 --> 01:12:26.663]  And they use a weird reverse psychology.
[01:12:26.663 --> 01:12:29.184]  Well, it's a woman, so it's okay to be cute.
[01:12:29.184 --> 01:12:34.926]  It's female empowerment!
[01:12:34.926 --> 01:12:50.794]  Well, in every ancient society, when they started to degenerate, they would order women to take their firstborn sons, it's in every history book, it's in burial grounds all over the world, and to throw their babies into fiery pits or into pools of water.
[01:12:50.794 --> 01:12:51.074]  For
[01:12:54.249 --> 01:13:15.409]  The winged serpent in Mesoamerica, and to different horned gods in Europe, and in Africa, again, to snake gods, and in Asia, to snake gods.
[01:13:15.409 --> 01:13:17.451]  These cultures were not in communication with each other.
[01:13:18.373 --> 01:13:28.300]  But they were, in every case, right before their fall, killing babies for demon gods.
[01:13:28.300 --> 01:13:34.223]  And all over the Old Testament, and they've dug up these places, it's in the Roman histories as well, Greek histories, confirmed.
[01:13:34.223 --> 01:13:40.507]  They're finding all where the Bible says that there'd be civilizations where they were eating and killing babies.
[01:13:41.505 --> 01:13:45.206]  And everyone else was like taking drugs and hurting themselves and all this.
[01:13:45.206 --> 01:13:51.689]  And then God would tell the Israelites, I want you to go in and wipe them all out.
[01:13:51.689 --> 01:13:57.611]  And then, you know, they tried the last 50 years and colleges ago, that was just propaganda of the Israelites to wipe out their enemies.
[01:13:57.611 --> 01:13:58.951]  We don't believe that was going on.
[01:13:58.951 --> 01:14:07.474]  And they dig up these giant mass graves of burn up babies and then read the Sanskrit and the cuneiform and the hieroglyphs.
[01:14:07.474 --> 01:14:08.895]  And it's just like, oh my God.
[01:14:16.044 --> 01:14:20.808]  And it was the energy of the children being tortured to death that people were getting.
[01:14:20.808 --> 01:14:26.393]  Now, they would always secretly keep some alive and torture them for extra fun, but they found that that would enrage the public and be too much.
[01:14:26.393 --> 01:14:29.315]  So, generally, long-term torturing children wasn't allowed.
[01:14:29.315 --> 01:14:31.277]  It would just be quick and public.
[01:14:31.277 --> 01:14:35.280]  But inside the temple, oh, they were really sucking them spiritually dry.
[01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:36.721]  Long, hardcore torture.
[01:14:36.721 --> 01:14:39.383]  Here are some of the devil worshippers in public.
[01:14:39.383 --> 01:14:44.788]  We talk about it so negatively that you feel like you should have this sense of shame after you get an abortion.
[01:14:45.506 --> 01:14:48.307]  Well, you can feel any way you want after you get an abortion.
[01:14:48.307 --> 01:14:49.567]  Get one!
[01:14:49.567 --> 01:14:52.988]  See how you feel!
[01:14:52.988 --> 01:14:55.688]  You know how my abortion made me feel?
[01:14:55.688 --> 01:14:57.449]  Very powerful.
[01:14:57.449 --> 01:15:00.069]  You know how people say you can't play God?
[01:15:00.069 --> 01:15:10.832]  I walked out of there being like, move over Morgan Freeman, I am God!
[01:15:12.905 --> 01:15:14.306]  Get out of my behind!
[01:15:14.306 --> 01:15:15.006]  Get out of my vagina!
[01:15:15.006 --> 01:15:16.827]  Get out!
[01:15:16.827 --> 01:15:18.547]  Don't knock it till you try it.
[01:15:18.547 --> 01:15:21.829]  And when you do try it, really knock it.
[01:15:21.829 --> 01:15:24.130]  You know, you gotta get that baby out of there.
[01:15:24.130 --> 01:15:30.132]  You talk to him.
[01:15:30.132 --> 01:15:31.833]  Alright, Matt Bracken is up next.
[01:15:34.463 --> 01:15:39.645]  Do I need to tell you you need to share the live links from BandOnVideo and InfoWars.com forward slash show?
[01:15:39.645 --> 01:15:43.626]  Do I need to tell the Paul Revere's out there that it's critical this transmission get out there?
[01:15:43.626 --> 01:15:45.867]  Everybody tuning in knows you're hearing the truth here.
[01:15:45.867 --> 01:15:47.007]  We've got the facts.
[01:15:47.007 --> 01:15:48.447]  We're facing the facts.
[01:15:48.447 --> 01:15:52.189]  We're winning together thanks to God and his son Jesus Christ.
[01:15:52.189 --> 01:15:52.589]  Stay with us.
[01:15:57.935 --> 01:16:00.256]  We're closing out the year 2019.
[01:16:00.256 --> 01:16:04.496]  I don't have to tell you that 2020 is going to be make it or break it.
[01:16:04.496 --> 01:16:07.737]  Not just for Infowars, not just for America, but the whole world.
[01:16:07.737 --> 01:16:13.398]  We are in a battle between the forces of globalism that want a post-human world and those that want a pro-human world.
[01:16:13.398 --> 01:16:15.819]  We're in a fight between Satan and Christ.
[01:16:15.819 --> 01:16:21.700]  And it's being played out amongst us mortals, but it's being directed from on high.
[01:16:21.700 --> 01:16:24.681]  And I'm just telling the listeners of this broadcast, without you,
[01:16:26.361 --> 01:16:27.681]  We're going to lose this fight.
[01:16:27.681 --> 01:16:32.922]  I need all of you to realize how important you are and how important InfoWars is and what we've done together.
[01:16:32.922 --> 01:16:38.623]  And to just take stock and take measure here at the end of the year and think about what you're going to do.
[01:16:38.623 --> 01:16:42.124]  Whether it's supporting InfoWars and buying products from us or starting your own show.
[01:16:42.124 --> 01:16:44.704]  Just whatever you do, take action now.
[01:16:44.704 --> 01:16:46.605]  History is happening.
[01:16:46.605 --> 01:16:48.625]  Please do your Christmas shopping.
[01:16:48.625 --> 01:16:51.325]  Please do your New Year's shopping at InfoWarsTour.com.
[01:16:51.325 --> 01:16:52.266]  We've got the best products.
[01:16:52.266 --> 01:16:54.246]  You're only helping the globalists if you don't do it.
[01:16:54.246 --> 01:16:54.506]  Thank you.
[01:16:56.696 --> 01:16:58.957]  InfoWars has delivered.
[01:16:58.957 --> 01:17:05.560]  InfoWars has come through time and time and time and time again.
[01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:12.584]  At that critical, game-changing moment, we have come through.
[01:17:12.584 --> 01:17:21.048]  And that means myself, the other hosts, the journalists, the researchers, the writers, the crew, down to the janitor, down to the bookkeeper,
[01:17:22.268 --> 01:17:24.069]  There is no top, there is no bottom.
[01:17:24.069 --> 01:17:28.111]  We are a family in this fight, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:17:28.111 --> 01:17:30.012]  And the stakes have never been higher.
[01:17:30.012 --> 01:17:32.193]  That's why the Globals want to take us out of the game.
[01:17:32.193 --> 01:17:36.095]  Only you keep InfoWars in the game.
[01:17:36.095 --> 01:17:37.616]  You are the InfoWar.
[01:17:37.616 --> 01:17:50.662]  And now, this Christmas, and coming up to the end of the year, is the time to spend your money at InfoWarStore.com to fund us into this next critical year of 2020 while getting great products that make your life and your family's life a lot better.
[01:17:51.082 --> 01:17:52.503]  Huge sales right now.
[01:17:52.503 --> 01:17:56.807]  Now's the time to shop at m4store.com.
[01:17:56.807 --> 01:18:02.531]  My fault, I fear.
[01:18:02.531 --> 01:18:05.894]  I thought that you'd want what I want.
[01:18:05.894 --> 01:18:12.599]  I'm sorry, my dear.
[01:18:12.599 --> 01:18:14.861]  But where are the clowns?
[01:18:25.907 --> 01:18:30.488]  The globalists have sent in the clowns.
[01:18:30.488 --> 01:18:32.269]  They've sent in Antifa.
[01:18:32.269 --> 01:18:36.290]  They've broken our borders with some of the most hardened criminals from around the world.
[01:18:36.290 --> 01:18:40.272]  They've tried to poison us with fluoride and GMO and the tainted vaccines.
[01:18:40.272 --> 01:18:41.532]  They've sent in their clowns.
[01:18:41.952 --> 01:18:47.594]  But now the men and women of America are taking action and confronting globalists everywhere.
[01:18:47.594 --> 01:18:50.375]  And I'm so proud of InfoWars leading the charge.
[01:18:50.375 --> 01:18:56.437]  But the only way we can do that is when you keep spreading the word about our broadcast and when you keep buying the great products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:18:57.529 --> 01:19:00.471]  Infowars doesn't have an audience.
[01:19:00.471 --> 01:19:16.840]  We have listeners, men and women, who bleed red blood, who are part of the human race, of every color, of every creed, who understand that evil is launching its full attack upon humanity now, and who are ready to stand and fight against the global scourge.
[01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:19.842]  And I need all of you to realize that you're the best we've got.
[01:19:20.682 --> 01:19:22.024]  Infowars is the best we've got.
[01:19:22.024 --> 01:19:24.206]  We're not perfect, but we're fighting hard.
[01:19:24.206 --> 01:19:29.953]  And we need your financial support now more than ever to stay on the air.
[01:19:29.953 --> 01:19:34.698]  Not just to expand in the face of the enemy, but just to stay on air.
[01:19:34.698 --> 01:19:35.839]  So I'm telling you, right now.
[01:19:36.420 --> 01:19:42.966]  I need you to step up to the plate, go to m4warstore.com and get great products that you already really need.
[01:19:42.966 --> 01:19:45.148]  The 12 days of Christmas is almost over.

[01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:02.883]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:32.791 --> 01:20:37.156]  Sunday, December 22nd, 2019.
[01:20:37.156 --> 01:20:42.781]  InfoWars, still on the air, still reaching millions, thanks to you.
[01:20:44.810 --> 01:20:46.911]  Thanks to this team.
[01:20:46.911 --> 01:20:50.533]  Thanks to everyone that values justice and freedom.
[01:20:50.533 --> 01:20:54.476]  Humanity has been taken down far, but it's awakening.
[01:20:54.476 --> 01:21:03.261]  You can hear and see the howls of anger from the social engineers who know time is running out for their plan.
[01:21:04.685 --> 01:21:12.170]  They can't defeat an awakened humanity, no matter how much money, no matter how many weapons, no matter how much propaganda.
[01:21:12.170 --> 01:21:15.012]  Once you decide to resist them with everything you've got,
[01:21:16.035 --> 01:21:22.798]  From the information war to getting on your knees to God standing up to these thugs, they will fall and they are falling.
[01:21:22.798 --> 01:21:24.980]  Matt Bracken is with us on this Sunday.
[01:21:24.980 --> 01:21:26.700]  Very, very thankful.
[01:21:26.700 --> 01:21:28.001]  I read some of his books years ago.
[01:21:28.001 --> 01:21:29.622]  Visit www.EnemiesFarAndDomestic.com.
[01:21:29.622 --> 01:21:30.723]  Really smart guy.
[01:21:30.723 --> 01:21:38.286]  And years ago, I know a lot of guys in the government and intelligence and smart people, they tune in because we're informed and have a lot of great guests as well.
[01:21:38.286 --> 01:21:39.927]  You ought to research Matt Bracken.
[01:21:39.927 --> 01:21:40.968]  He really knows what he's talking about.
[01:21:41.721 --> 01:21:55.951]  Well, he's always coming on the show saying, well in this book I predicted how they try a martial law scenario in Virginia with gun confiscation and how they'd use a mass shooting to trigger it and how the globalists are ever in real trouble, they're going to try this scenario.
[01:21:55.951 --> 01:21:59.334]  And we have George Soros' real documents now showing similar things.
[01:21:59.334 --> 01:22:07.400]  The Attorney General talking about going after Soros, how they're trying to install their people at the state and local level as prosecutors and sheriffs.
[01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:12.205]  But Bracken wrote this article, Virginia Checkpoints, What Could Possibly Go Wrong?
[01:22:12.205 --> 01:22:15.168]  And it's an excerpt of his 2003 book.
[01:22:15.168 --> 01:22:21.216]  And it's really best for him to break it all down.
[01:22:22.739 --> 01:22:35.989]  But it's got the quotes here, and it's eerily parallel to what they're saying they're going to start doing January 20th in Virginia, openly saying they want to use the military to confiscate guns, to arrest sheriffs that don't go confiscate the guns, all semi-autos.
[01:22:35.989 --> 01:22:36.510]  It's here.
[01:22:36.510 --> 01:22:37.010]  It's happening.
[01:22:37.010 --> 01:22:40.813]  The story's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:22:40.813 --> 01:22:41.313]  It's also
[01:22:42.418 --> 01:22:42.879]  That's right.
[01:23:03.277 --> 01:23:05.018]  Matt Bracken, thank you for joining us tonight.
[01:23:05.018 --> 01:23:21.726]  I specifically want to get into the scenarios in Virginia, other areas of the country, and other tricks you think they have up their sleeves, because I don't want to sit here as the awakening happens, and as everything The Globalist does falls in its face and be overconfident, because you've laid out scenarios that we now see starting to happen.
[01:23:21.726 --> 01:23:26.309]  Give us that over-the-horizon radar on what you think is coming next.
[01:23:26.309 --> 01:23:27.069]  Hi, Alex.
[01:23:27.069 --> 01:23:28.410]  Yeah, I've been watching the show.
[01:23:29.710 --> 01:23:35.112]  What you've been recounting about the feeling power through murdering babies, I mean, it's all spot on.
[01:23:35.112 --> 01:23:45.657]  These are like flashing red warning lights for a society that's really approaching the abyss in many respects.
[01:23:45.657 --> 01:23:54.900]  I wrote this novel in the early 2000s, Enemies Foreign and Domestic, because I'm a student of history for a long time.
[01:23:54.900 --> 01:23:56.501]  I was an officer in the SEAL teams.
[01:23:57.290 --> 01:24:08.816]  I saw some corruption in the military where units were given no oversight at all and they just had a black budget and they went way off the rails.
[01:24:08.816 --> 01:24:15.519]  And I've been studying other types of units that have gone off the rails.
[01:24:15.519 --> 01:24:19.481]  Sometimes they start with very good motives and very good ideas.
[01:24:19.481 --> 01:24:23.403]  And I'd like to draw a line from what's happening in Virginia
[01:24:24.531 --> 01:24:32.598]  Through Northern Ireland in the 70s and 80s and then back to Kenya and the Mau Mau wars in the 1950s.
[01:24:32.598 --> 01:24:44.949]  There was a British officer, just a lieutenant at the end of World War II, but he was in Kenya during the Mau Mau uprising and he came up with this concept he called gangs and counter gangs.
[01:24:44.949 --> 01:24:48.973]  It's really about false flag operations and he literally wrote a book
[01:24:49.574 --> 01:24:51.275]  The book is called Gangs and Countergangs.
[01:25:04.577 --> 01:25:14.442]  That would dress and appear to be one of the factions fighting in the Mau Mau Uprising to attack another faction and then leave false clues.
[01:25:14.442 --> 01:25:24.086]  This got the different factions within the Mau Mau Uprising, instead of focusing and fighting against the British colonial rule, they began fighting each other.
[01:25:24.571 --> 01:25:27.315]  So this was considered very successful.
[01:25:27.315 --> 01:25:30.038]  Frank Kitson is promoted Major Colonel.
[01:25:30.038 --> 01:25:31.721]  He becomes a Brigadier General 1970.
[01:25:31.721 --> 01:25:34.424]  He's the like rising star.
[01:25:34.424 --> 01:25:36.207]  He goes to Northern Ireland.
[01:25:36.207 --> 01:25:41.614]  He's going to use these gangs and counter gangs, false flag tactics in Northern Ireland.
[01:25:41.934 --> 01:25:43.195]  Thinking, hey, it worked in Kenya.
[01:25:43.195 --> 01:25:44.235]  It ought to work in Ireland.
[01:25:44.235 --> 01:25:46.416]  And by the way, you're talking about mainline history.
[01:25:46.416 --> 01:25:47.696]  This is all admitted.
[01:25:47.696 --> 01:25:55.700]  I had Steak Knife, one of the British commandos that was running this, blowing stuff up, blaming it on the Irish, on the show, and he was killed like two weeks later.
[01:25:55.700 --> 01:25:58.381]  So I want people to know, that's how dangerous all this is.
[01:25:58.381 --> 01:25:58.881]  Please continue.
[01:25:59.912 --> 01:26:08.296]  Yes, so the SAS used sock puppets like Ulster Volunteer Force, things like that, to do some of their dirty work.
[01:26:08.296 --> 01:26:11.118]  But they literally planted false bombs.
[01:26:11.118 --> 01:26:14.900]  They put bombs in British and Protestant pubs.
[01:26:15.300 --> 01:26:17.002]  To be blamed on the Irish.
[01:26:17.002 --> 01:26:20.385]  They thought it worked in Kenya with the Mau Mau uprising.
[01:26:20.385 --> 01:26:31.576]  Well, it was like pouring rocket fuel on the IRA when they tried this tactic that had been successful, you know, 15 years earlier in East Africa.
[01:26:31.576 --> 01:26:36.080]  When they tried it in Northern Ireland, it was a major backfire.
[01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:37.542]  Now, bringing it to today.
[01:26:38.516 --> 01:26:49.163]  The special units that we've been training, that have been learning a lot of tricks in Iraq and Afghanistan and really all over the world because those are just the overt places.
[01:26:49.163 --> 01:26:56.488]  We've got special forces all over the places, all over the globe really, doing dirty tricks and dirty ops.
[01:26:56.488 --> 01:27:03.593]  They come home, we see that the tactics and strategies that are employed around the world by our special operations forces
[01:27:04.053 --> 01:27:04.133]  Yeah.
[01:27:20.297 --> 01:27:23.779]  They tried to use those tricks against Trump.
[01:27:23.779 --> 01:27:39.906]  Well, if they try to do these things in Virginia, you know, the false flag missions, discrediting operations, you know, leaving bombs that will be attributed to right-wing militias, it's going to be what happened in Northern Ireland.
[01:27:40.306 --> 01:27:43.329]  It's going to have the exact opposite effect.
[01:27:43.329 --> 01:27:58.742]  Instead of discrediting the so-called right-wing white nationalist militias, it's going to be like pouring rocket fuel onto the fire, just like it was when Frank Kitson took his Mao Mao strategy to Northern Ireland.
[01:27:58.742 --> 01:28:07.269]  There's never been a civil war in the history of the world where there have been so many tens of thousands of
[01:28:07.842 --> 01:28:08.663]  All right.
[01:28:22.822 --> 01:28:28.906]  You know, ten trucks, a couple armored personnel carriers, put up a perimeter around the village and sweep it.
[01:28:28.906 --> 01:28:31.268]  That will not work in Virginia.
[01:28:31.268 --> 01:28:32.149]  That will not work in Virginia.
[01:28:32.149 --> 01:28:40.455]  Let's talk about how the globalists are going to try to destabilize everything with false flags and provocateur ops while they're so upset that we exposed
[01:28:41.495 --> 01:28:47.718]  What they were trying to gin up in Virginia a few years ago and why they hope we wouldn't be on air to have people there to cover it this time.
[01:28:47.718 --> 01:28:48.598]  We're not just going to cover it.
[01:28:48.598 --> 01:28:54.241]  We're going to have dozens of our people in Virginia on the 20th to stop the deep state from pulling this off.
[01:28:58.900 --> 01:29:00.681]  Real Red Pill.
[01:29:00.681 --> 01:29:02.882]  Real Red Pill Plus.
[01:29:02.882 --> 01:29:17.948]  Please go to Infowarshore.com and research the preglanone alone that is in each of these products and then research all the other things that are in Real Red Pill and Real Red Pill Plus and what they will do for you and your family.

[01:29:33.352 --> 01:29:36.813]  Ladies and gentlemen, research what this does in your body.
[01:29:37.413 --> 01:29:40.497]  Then experience it for yourself if you want to go to the next level.
[01:29:40.497 --> 01:29:43.139]  I'd say it funds the InfoWar before losing money on this.
[01:29:43.139 --> 01:29:49.206]  This is my gift to you this Christmas so you experience it for yourself like the other products.
[01:29:49.206 --> 01:29:51.188]  InfoWarStore.com.
[01:29:51.188 --> 01:29:52.870]  That's InfoWarStore.com.
[01:29:52.870 --> 01:29:53.731]  Please take action.
[01:29:57.148 --> 01:30:01.976]  I'm here to give the listeners and viewers a project report in the next 60 seconds.
[01:30:01.976 --> 01:30:03.798]  And here's the bottom line.
[01:30:03.798 --> 01:30:05.221]  I'm not playing around.
[01:30:05.221 --> 01:30:06.663]  I'm not screwing around.
[01:30:06.663 --> 01:30:07.544]  I'm not joking.
[01:30:07.544 --> 01:30:08.205]  And neither are you.
[01:30:09.634 --> 01:30:24.944]  InfoWars and this operation we built together has delivered for America, has delivered for our children and the unborn, has delivered in the face of toxic fluoride and the GMOs and the deadly vaccine depopulation operation.
[01:30:24.944 --> 01:30:27.826]  What we're doing is beyond critical.
[01:30:27.826 --> 01:30:28.987]  Did you hear the key word?
[01:30:28.987 --> 01:30:33.410]  What we are doing is beyond critical.
[01:30:34.270 --> 01:30:48.363]  So, this is the time with the biggest sales ever during Christmas at InfoWarsTour.com to get in there and buy these products you already need that I need the funding for to get this operation to the next level.
[01:30:48.363 --> 01:30:49.884]  I need the money.
[01:30:49.884 --> 01:30:52.107]  I need to be able to fight the globalists.
[01:30:52.107 --> 01:30:53.228]  I need you.
[01:30:53.228 --> 01:30:54.429]  You need these products.
[01:30:54.429 --> 01:30:55.630]  Get them at InfoWarsTour.com.
[01:30:57.671 --> 01:31:00.954]  So what's the most important part, let's say, in a bulldozer running over the Globalist?
[01:31:00.954 --> 01:31:04.416]  The treads, the wheels, the engine, the scoop on the front.
[01:31:04.416 --> 01:31:07.158]  It's all very important, but the fuel is paramount.
[01:31:07.158 --> 01:31:08.039]  And that's my allegory.
[01:31:09.116 --> 01:31:20.181]  TurboForce is vitamins, minerals, amino acids that synergistically work with six different natural forms of healthy, clean energy that last for 10 hours in the average metabolic system metabolism of a human.
[01:31:20.181 --> 01:31:22.502]  Some people get 15 hours out of it, some people get about 8 hours.
[01:31:22.502 --> 01:31:28.224]  But people take this, people are taking it in sports, people cannot believe it's the best they've ever had because it's not high.
[01:31:28.224 --> 01:31:34.447]  Nobody puts as much product into their pre-workouts, their post-workouts, you can call us whatever you want.
[01:31:34.447 --> 01:31:35.887]  It's a total solution.
[01:31:35.887 --> 01:31:37.048]  All around the best you're going to find.
[01:31:37.148 --> 01:31:38.169]  Turbo Force.
[01:31:38.169 --> 01:31:40.410]  Without you, we don't roll.
[01:31:40.410 --> 01:31:42.131]  With you, we surge forward together.
[01:31:42.131 --> 01:31:44.173]  It's like the bulldozer without the diesel fuel.
[01:31:44.173 --> 01:31:46.795]  If we don't have your financial support, we will be defeated.
[01:31:46.795 --> 01:31:49.817]  You support us and get products you already need that literally fuel your body and your mind?
[01:31:49.817 --> 01:31:51.638]  It's a win-win.
[01:31:51.638 --> 01:31:52.298]  360 together.
[01:31:52.298 --> 01:31:53.759]  Infowarsstore.com or AAA253-3139.
[01:31:53.759 --> 01:31:54.400]  My fault, I fear.
[01:32:02.865 --> 01:32:15.232]  I thought that you'd want what I want I'm sorry, my dear But where are the clowns?
[01:32:15.232 --> 01:32:16.233]  Send in the clowns
[01:32:26.261 --> 01:32:30.843]  The globalists have sent in the clowns.
[01:32:30.843 --> 01:32:32.624]  They've sent in Antifa.
[01:32:32.624 --> 01:32:36.665]  They've broken our borders with some of the most hardened criminals from around the world.
[01:32:36.665 --> 01:32:40.627]  They've tried to poison us with fluoride and GMO and the tainted vaccines.
[01:32:40.627 --> 01:32:42.328]  They've sent in their clowns.
[01:32:42.328 --> 01:32:47.990]  But now, the men and women of America are taking action and confronting globalists everywhere.
[01:32:47.990 --> 01:32:50.411]  And I'm so proud of Infowars leading the charge.
[01:32:50.891 --> 01:32:59.719]  The only way we can do that is when you keep spreading the word about our broadcast and when you keep buying the great products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:32:59.719 --> 01:33:02.362]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:14.931 --> 01:33:19.778]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:33:19.778 --> 01:33:22.623]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:22.623 --> 01:33:23.264]  We are live!
[01:33:24.727 --> 01:33:28.931]  We are broadcasting worldwide on this Sunday transmission.
[01:33:28.931 --> 01:33:34.276]  Now, we know Soros has planned violence at events that would trigger race war and martial law.
[01:33:34.276 --> 01:33:36.618]  I have the documents right here, covered it earlier.
[01:33:36.618 --> 01:33:42.183]  We're showing you the history of a former Navy SEAL officer who works in the Middle East and around the world.
[01:33:42.183 --> 01:33:45.826]  And, you know, these tactics are taught by governments all over the place.
[01:33:45.826 --> 01:33:49.210]  Even army intelligence officers at the level of captain.
[01:33:49.750 --> 01:33:49.930]  Are you
[01:34:05.064 --> 01:34:07.064]  Committed atrocity, blaming on your enemies.
[01:34:07.064 --> 01:34:08.865]  The left needs that.
[01:34:08.865 --> 01:34:12.225]  That's why they had their own antifa do Texas and Ohio.
[01:34:12.225 --> 01:34:16.086]  You notice they expunged it all, tried to say they were right-wingers and Trump supporters.
[01:34:16.086 --> 01:34:17.987]  So there's lots of levels to this.
[01:34:17.987 --> 01:34:19.967]  Blame something a crazy does on us.
[01:34:19.967 --> 01:34:20.747]  Stage something.
[01:34:20.747 --> 01:34:21.727]  Wind it up.
[01:34:21.727 --> 01:34:27.949]  This is a Charlottesville where they collide two groups together to create the narrative on a bigger scale.
[01:34:27.949 --> 01:34:31.969]  Explain why it's so big and why your article from 16 years ago is so important.
[01:34:31.969 --> 01:34:34.350]  It's posted on the front page of InfoWars.com.
[01:34:34.350 --> 01:34:34.550]  Matt?
[01:34:36.834 --> 01:34:43.780]  My first novel, Enemies Foreign and Domestic, it actually begins with a false flag sniper attack on a stadium.
[01:34:43.780 --> 01:34:51.848]  And that leads immediately to Congress passing a law banning semi-automatic so-called assault rifles.
[01:34:51.848 --> 01:35:01.037]  Then politicians, notably in Virginia and Maryland, they try to get out in front of this what they perceive as the winning hand or a way to publicize themselves to higher office.
[01:35:01.577 --> 01:35:02.057]  We're good to go.
[01:35:18.624 --> 01:35:21.205]  It almost, you know, it's like I'm just shaking my head.
[01:35:21.205 --> 01:35:24.987]  That's the most famous book called Unintended Consequences.
[01:35:24.987 --> 01:35:26.068]  They've got no idea.
[01:35:26.068 --> 01:35:43.617]  So, in the short excerpt that's posted at American Partisan, it's just highlighting a checkpoint, a gun checkpoint, that goes completely haywire, out of control, action begetting action, and, you know, just amplifying at each step.
[01:35:44.097 --> 01:35:49.799]  That these politicians that think that they can just pass the law and force the law and it's going to go down.
[01:35:49.799 --> 01:35:55.341]  They really have no idea how this this can accelerate out of their control so fast.
[01:35:55.341 --> 01:36:03.224]  And my fear is that Richmond is going to be seen as an opportunity for like a Charlottesville on steroids.
[01:36:03.224 --> 01:36:05.144]  The left is very desperate.
[01:36:05.144 --> 01:36:10.466]  The impeachment at the sham is not really working and they need to change the subject.
[01:36:11.189 --> 01:36:13.012]  And Matt, let me just add to this.
[01:36:13.012 --> 01:36:15.976]  They're the ones saying we're going to use the military.
[01:36:26.229 --> 01:36:30.052]  Where you have the Attorney General, you have the Governor, they're all in scandals.
[01:36:30.052 --> 01:36:32.194]  They've all been caught in big corruption problems.
[01:36:32.194 --> 01:36:37.318]  They're all perfectly compromised and being flogged into these provocative statements.
[01:36:37.318 --> 01:36:40.680]  If you're really just going to come for the guns, you'd pass the laws, put pressure on people.
[01:36:40.680 --> 01:36:44.223]  No, they're all wanting a confrontation.
[01:36:44.223 --> 01:36:46.745]  They're all trying to rabble-rouse people into this.
[01:36:48.066 --> 01:37:02.720]  Yes, because I think that their perception is that they can force Trump into a misstep, you know, a mortal sin, something when, you know, he said whatever he said in Charlottesville was fun as Trump says there's good Nazis.
[01:37:03.180 --> 01:37:05.941]  Which was a lie, but that's how they think they can spin it around.
[01:37:05.941 --> 01:37:19.408]  Major law enforcement publications, please put that back on screen guys, major law enforcement publications like law enforcement today are having to say, National Guardsmen, we will not comply with order by Virginia government to arrest police, confiscate guns.
[01:37:19.408 --> 01:37:24.011]  That's the level, that's December 20th, two days ago, we've gotten to.
[01:37:24.011 --> 01:37:26.012]  This is not us saying this is coming.
[01:37:26.012 --> 01:37:29.413]  This is, hell yes, I'm going to take your, you know, your semi-autos.
[01:37:29.413 --> 01:37:32.495]  Hell yes, you know, we're going to kill gun owners if they don't turn them in.
[01:37:33.895 --> 01:37:38.258]  The lead Democrat whip in the House saying we're going to hang Trump on national TV.
[01:37:38.258 --> 01:37:41.862]  I mean, these people are spoiling for a fight.
[01:37:41.862 --> 01:37:57.255]  Yeah, this is a microcosm of the red-blue county map, where you've got a majority population in just a few blue counties in Richmond, northern Virginia, tipped heavily by the immigrant
[01:37:57.795 --> 01:37:58.416]  I think?
[01:38:14.153 --> 01:38:21.715]  So you've got 85 out of 95, or maybe 86 now, out of 95 Virginia counties voting to become sanctuary counties.
[01:38:21.715 --> 01:38:31.598]  And let me tell you, you can't just send a convoy of SUVs out into rural America anywhere and not be picked off by people with high-powered rifles.
[01:38:31.598 --> 01:38:38.380]  You know, a few thousand Taliban have kept us from conquering Afghanistan in 20 years.
[01:38:38.380 --> 01:38:39.320]  Same thing in Vietnam.
[01:38:39.320 --> 01:38:40.300]  So let's expand on this.
[01:38:42.679 --> 01:38:44.340]  That was social engineering has been declassified.
[01:38:44.340 --> 01:38:49.181]  They almost started it, made us lose it on purpose to create the whole leftist movement here in the U.S.
[01:38:49.181 --> 01:38:50.281]  and expand it.
[01:38:50.281 --> 01:38:53.122]  But let's pull back here Matt Bracken quickly.
[01:38:53.122 --> 01:39:03.066]  We have to understand that again, they want this crisis and just like the rest of the map of the country, they only control the big population centers where they bring in their election fraud.
[01:39:03.066 --> 01:39:04.726]  It can never be kicked out.
[01:39:04.726 --> 01:39:06.467]  And so this is just another example
[01:39:07.483 --> 01:39:08.504]  I don't
[01:39:30.043 --> 01:39:31.344]  We want to have a confrontation.
[01:39:31.344 --> 01:39:34.867]  We're going to take your semi-autos, and if you resist, we'll use nuclear weapons.
[01:39:34.867 --> 01:39:41.593]  Showing the total arrogance that that is a city-destroying weapon, which would be used on blue cities from his view.
[01:39:41.593 --> 01:39:42.834]  I'm not saying do that.
[01:39:42.834 --> 01:39:46.357]  It's not for rural areas, unless you want total extermination.
[01:39:46.357 --> 01:39:50.941]  Whoever uses that will be discredited right away, but it shows their military disconnect.
[01:39:50.941 --> 01:39:53.824]  Meanwhile, almost everyone that has military background hates their guts.
[01:39:53.824 --> 01:39:54.485]  Please continue.
[01:39:54.485 --> 01:39:57.067]  This is a Marie Antoinette, let them eat cake type statement.
[01:39:58.840 --> 01:40:07.282]  The reason that false flag operations are so effective, and this is the reason I wrote this book, because I could just see this coming.
[01:40:07.282 --> 01:40:13.924]  The reason it's so effective is, there's a saying, in the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.
[01:40:13.924 --> 01:40:22.946]  Well, in the land of mostly first-level, open-level thinkers, a second-level thinker is like a genius.
[01:40:23.519 --> 01:40:35.092]  So if you do a false flag operation, if there's a white militia redneck next to a gun outside the stadium after the stadium massacre, that's how it's going to play.
[01:40:35.092 --> 01:40:39.077]  Nobody's going to say, wait a minute, why would a white veteran do that?
[01:40:39.637 --> 01:40:40.437]  Why would they do that?
[01:40:40.437 --> 01:40:46.579]  They're first-level thinkers will go with the narrative that the evil white racists are just spoilers.
[01:40:46.579 --> 01:40:51.221]  Because they're all primed to do it, and then we're not supposed to question when these things happen.
[01:40:51.221 --> 01:40:52.901]  They've got it all primed and ready.
[01:40:52.901 --> 01:40:55.362]  And they're saying that the media is going to be attacked.
[01:40:55.362 --> 01:40:57.223]  White terrorists are going to rise up and attack.
[01:40:57.883 --> 01:41:01.125]  The FBI says it's the number one threat, but it doesn't even register as a threat.
[01:41:01.125 --> 01:41:15.211]  It's all primed and ready, all the shows, all the movies for this, except if they think two or three levels into what's going to happen if they start this hot civil war, I mean, these globalists are going to all have to run for the hills.
[01:41:15.211 --> 01:41:24.015]  But in the meantime, it can lead to a cascade where, you know, if people are starting a sniper war in this country,
[01:41:25.046 --> 01:41:28.972]  It can lead to a cascade which would be devastating for everybody.
[01:41:28.972 --> 01:41:32.016]  I mean, we're talking about the electricity going out.
[01:41:32.016 --> 01:41:34.680]  Because a city, if it's rural versus urban,
[01:41:35.396 --> 01:41:38.858]  Then Urban's in the hurt locker because they don't feed themselves.
[01:41:38.858 --> 01:41:41.479]  They don't have their own water or electricity.
[01:41:41.479 --> 01:41:53.565]  It's all set up culturally where the Christian right-wingers know how to run things, know how to skin a buck, know how to run a trot line, have all the infrastructure, are awake, know what's going on.
[01:41:53.565 --> 01:42:01.468]  The cities are drugged out, satanic, literally out of their minds, falling apart, and they're trying to start a war with their food supply.
[01:42:01.468 --> 01:42:02.889]  Let me just say this.
[01:42:02.889 --> 01:42:04.770]  I want to invite you here because I want to go to Virginia.
[01:42:04.830 --> 01:42:05.050]  We're good.
[01:42:23.889 --> 01:42:24.750]  We want other people.
[01:42:24.750 --> 01:42:26.751]  I want to work with Stuart Rhodes and others.
[01:42:26.751 --> 01:42:33.434]  We need to put a lot of personnel there and be very clear that we're not going to be with the fake white supremacist wind-up toys that they admittedly have hired.
[01:42:33.434 --> 01:42:37.076]  We're going to be there exposing them, so they can't just say it's two groups.
[01:42:37.076 --> 01:42:38.297]  And we're going to stand against this.
[01:42:38.297 --> 01:42:41.638]  Matt Bracken, if you've got time, I've got Steve Pchenik on tomorrow and a bunch of other guests.
[01:42:41.638 --> 01:42:44.280]  If you can pop in again, that would be wonderful to talk about.
[01:42:44.680 --> 01:42:46.183]  The different scenarios that unfold.
[01:42:46.183 --> 01:42:47.767]  EnemiesFarmDomestic.com.
[01:42:47.767 --> 01:42:50.993]  Your article's up on InfoWars.com from 16 years ago.
[01:42:50.993 --> 01:42:51.554]  God bless you.
[01:42:51.554 --> 01:42:53.599]  Final segment on other key intel.
[01:42:53.599 --> 01:42:54.460]  Straight ahead, please stay with us.
[01:42:56.562 --> 01:43:04.707]  It's your last chance to get the original designer limited-edition Jeffrey Epstein Christmas sweater.
[01:43:04.707 --> 01:43:17.715]  The globalists are so scared of this story continuing to come out for people learning about the deep state and the international blackmail rings using kidnapped women and children to compromise world leaders.
[01:43:17.715 --> 01:43:21.938]  They do not want this story continuing and this is your last chance
[01:43:22.538 --> 01:43:30.544]  To get the limited edition Christmas sweater at Infowarsstore.com to help spread the word, to have a piece of history, and to fund our operation.
[01:43:30.544 --> 01:43:33.947]  So, again, it says Christmas lights are a lot like Epstein.
[01:43:33.947 --> 01:43:36.609]  These things don't hang themselves on the front.
[01:43:36.609 --> 01:43:41.153]  On the back, it's got Infowars.com and shows the O in Infowars as a wreath.
[01:43:41.153 --> 01:43:42.194]  It's also a noose.
[01:43:42.774 --> 01:43:46.440]  The system can't stand it when you promote things at the grassroots level.
[01:43:46.440 --> 01:43:50.686]  They can't stand it when you fund independent, pro-America, pro-human media.
[01:43:50.686 --> 01:43:54.352]  That's why you've got to take advantage of this shirt and get it today.
[01:43:54.352 --> 01:43:55.494]  MemphilWoreStore.com.
[01:43:58.996 --> 01:44:00.897]  The globalists think America's done.
[01:44:00.897 --> 01:44:02.739]  The globalists think the West is done.
[01:44:02.739 --> 01:44:05.520]  They think that Christians are done and finished.
[01:44:05.520 --> 01:44:07.762]  They believe they've broken our backs.
[01:44:07.762 --> 01:44:12.685]  They believe that with big tech censorship, we'll just crawl into ditches and submit to them.
[01:44:12.685 --> 01:44:24.473]  And they believe that if they can demonize and shut down Infowars, that they rightfully see as a symbol, a beacon of populism and freedom, not just to America, but to the whole world, that they can demoralize everybody else and win.
[01:44:24.473 --> 01:44:27.195]  Why, if they can shut Infowars down, they can intimidate everybody else.
[01:44:27.635 --> 01:44:31.037]  That's why it's beyond critical that you keep InfoWars on the air.
[01:44:31.037 --> 01:44:34.699]  It's only by your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support that we're on air.
[01:44:34.699 --> 01:44:38.241]  And I want to thank you all this Christmas for your past support.
[01:44:38.241 --> 01:44:46.765]  But I want to encourage you now to redouble your efforts and financially support us by getting great products you need during the 12 days of Christmas at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:44:46.765 --> 01:44:51.228]  Massive sales, store-wide free shipping, double pay-to-read points.
[01:44:51.228 --> 01:44:53.048]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:44:53.048 --> 01:44:54.389]  Please take action now.
[01:44:54.389 --> 01:44:55.670]  George Soros hopes you don't.
[01:44:57.058 --> 01:45:14.762]  I fought, I feared I thought that you'd want what I want I'm sorry, my dear But where are the clowns?
[01:45:14.762 --> 01:45:16.123]  Send in the clowns
[01:45:25.792 --> 01:45:30.358]  The globalists have sent in the clowns.
[01:45:30.358 --> 01:45:32.160]  They've sent in Antifa.
[01:45:32.160 --> 01:45:36.185]  They've broken our borders with some of the most hardened criminals from around the world.
[01:45:36.185 --> 01:45:40.170]  They've tried to poison us with fluoride and GMO and the tainted vaccines.
[01:45:40.170 --> 01:45:41.432]  They've sent in their clowns.
[01:45:41.832 --> 01:45:47.494]  But now the men and women of America are taking action and confronting globalists everywhere.
[01:45:47.494 --> 01:45:50.255]  And I'm so proud of InfoWars leading the charge.
[01:45:50.255 --> 01:45:57.398]  But the only way we can do that is when you keep spreading the word about our broadcast and when you keep buying the great products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:45:57.398 --> 01:45:59.619]  InfoWars has delivered.
[01:46:00.808 --> 01:46:06.253]  InfoWars has come through time and time and time and time again.
[01:46:06.253 --> 01:46:13.279]  At that critical, game-changing moment, we have come through.
[01:46:13.279 --> 01:46:21.747]  And that means myself, the other hosts, the journalists, the researchers, the writers, the crew, down to the janitor, down to the bookkeeper.
[01:46:22.948 --> 01:46:24.749]  There is no top, there is no bottom.
[01:46:24.749 --> 01:46:28.811]  We are a family in this fight, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:46:28.811 --> 01:46:30.692]  And the stakes have never been higher.
[01:46:30.692 --> 01:46:32.873]  That's why the Globals want to take us out of the game.
[01:46:32.873 --> 01:46:36.794]  Only you keep InfoWars in the game.
[01:46:36.794 --> 01:46:38.315]  You are the InfoWar.
[01:46:38.315 --> 01:46:51.361]  And now, this Christmas, and coming up to the end of the year, is the time to spend your money at InfoWarStore.com to fund us into this next critical year of 2020 while getting great products that make your life and your family's life a lot better.
[01:46:51.781 --> 01:46:53.221]  Huge sales right now.
[01:46:53.221 --> 01:46:59.703]  Now's the time to shop at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:46:59.703 --> 01:47:11.206]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:11.206 --> 01:47:12.047]  Welcome back, folks.
[01:47:12.047 --> 01:47:20.449]  Alex Jones here, and I'm really sorry at Christmastime to have to talk about such serious issues while there's fun football games and things on, but America's fighting for its life and starting to really win.
[01:47:21.328 --> 01:47:27.151]  But the globalists have got their task force, they control Virginia, and they've got a lot of the feds still on their payroll.
[01:47:27.151 --> 01:47:31.053]  They've already tried to stage things, and they're clearly trying to stage something in Virginia.
[01:47:31.053 --> 01:47:34.015]  Matt Bracken called it years ago, and he's going to be there.
[01:47:34.015 --> 01:47:35.215]  We're going to send crew there.
[01:47:35.215 --> 01:47:39.297]  Coming up on the 20th is when they say they're going to start trying to move forward with their gun confiscations.
[01:47:39.297 --> 01:47:42.579]  They're going to try to have some fake right-wing, left-wing clashes.
[01:47:42.579 --> 01:47:44.640]  They're at the Commonwealth Capitol.
[01:47:44.640 --> 01:47:45.761]  We're going to be covering that.
[01:47:46.081 --> 01:47:58.625]  Matt, just in a minute and a half or so, recap, you were telling me during the break, you believe they're going to try to go operational with false flags or with gang, counter gang operations, similar to how they set up the IRA.
[01:47:58.625 --> 01:48:02.346]  You believe that's how they're going to try to discredit the American resistance?
[01:48:02.346 --> 01:48:15.110]  You know, you have to think that at the top of these task forces, at the level of the same people, the same level of people that were involved in the deep state coup, the poker buddies of people like Peter Strzok,
[01:48:15.859 --> 01:48:16.919]  Hate us, okay?
[01:48:16.919 --> 01:48:21.660]  You know, Brennan was a communist who became the head of the CIA.
[01:48:21.660 --> 01:48:27.721]  Mueller is a kind of a religious communist, or excuse me, not Mueller, Comey.
[01:48:27.721 --> 01:48:33.022]  The people they've been promoting for years now hate our guts.
[01:48:33.022 --> 01:48:38.203]  And they, as globalists, they don't like that the biggest threat is jihad.
[01:48:38.203 --> 01:48:43.124]  If jihad is the threat, then the solution is patriotic nationalism.
[01:48:43.124 --> 01:48:43.964]  Keep them out.
[01:48:44.525 --> 01:48:58.192]  So their goal as globalists is to break the back of what they call white nationalists, and that would be like George Washington, white nationalist, to break our back by discrediting us, by using discrediting false flag operations.
[01:48:58.192 --> 01:49:02.635]  So I think that Richmond is already up on their board, up on their screen.
[01:49:03.475 --> 01:49:04.516]  People will be promoted.
[01:49:04.516 --> 01:49:09.078]  You know, if they get the right consequences out of Richmond, people's careers will be made.
[01:49:09.078 --> 01:49:09.358]  That's right.
[01:49:09.358 --> 01:49:10.979]  They're like Hitler, and this is the Battle of the Bulge.
[01:49:10.979 --> 01:49:14.521]  They believe they can turn it all around here, and all their propaganda is around this.
[01:49:14.521 --> 01:49:20.683]  We already know they staged the last Virginia deal by colliding the two groups together, having the police do it, and so they're planning something big.
[01:49:20.683 --> 01:49:21.884]  I totally agree.
[01:49:21.884 --> 01:49:26.586]  Come back tomorrow, Steve Pachinick's on, but come back and talk about how we stop it more.
[01:49:26.586 --> 01:49:28.247]  You're coming to town soon.
[01:49:28.247 --> 01:49:29.868]  Matt Bracken, thank you and God bless you.
[01:49:31.015 --> 01:49:32.096]  Thank you.
[01:49:32.096 --> 01:49:35.359]  Alright folks, I'm out of time and I really wanted to get to...
[01:49:37.216 --> 01:49:42.618]  The attack on free speech, and who's really behind it, and why Trump hasn't taken action.
[01:49:42.618 --> 01:49:45.459]  Because the Republicans are paid off by these people.
[01:49:45.459 --> 01:49:49.381]  And Tucker Carlson did an incredible job Friday night laying this out.
[01:49:49.381 --> 01:49:54.243]  The full interview, as he also had some guests on, the full show is on Infowars.com.
[01:49:54.243 --> 01:49:55.784]  Tucker Carlson exposes D.C.
[01:49:55.784 --> 01:49:58.145]  conservatives for doing big text bidding.
[01:49:58.145 --> 01:49:59.605]  But it's bigger than that.
[01:49:59.605 --> 01:50:01.606]  Big mainstream corporate media.
[01:50:04.682 --> 01:50:08.545]  They don't want the competition, so that's also why they're shutting everybody down.
[01:50:08.545 --> 01:50:18.031]  And they don't care if people can't communicate politically, and that's the most effective thing, because they want to force all the TV buys, again, to be only on mainstream TV, not on the internet.
[01:50:19.209 --> 01:50:21.950]  That's why they're happy Big Tech has banned Trump from advertising.
[01:50:21.950 --> 01:50:25.691]  So this is really the Achilles heel of Trump and the American people.
[01:50:25.691 --> 01:50:28.171]  And Barr's talking about taking action against Big Tech.
[01:50:28.171 --> 01:50:29.251]  There's only 316 days left.
[01:50:29.251 --> 01:50:32.012]  They need to act in the next month or so.
[01:50:32.012 --> 01:50:33.272]  It needs to happen now.
[01:50:33.272 --> 01:50:39.954]  Trump not acting has just allowed Big Tech and the rest of them to engage in levels of censorship and control not even seen in Communist China.
[01:50:39.954 --> 01:50:41.914]  I mean, this is just unbelievable.
[01:50:41.914 --> 01:50:44.355]  Not letting him send out images of Melania Trump on Facebook.
[01:50:45.235 --> 01:50:48.538]  You know, not letting people show women shooting guns, saying that's terrorism.
[01:50:48.538 --> 01:50:52.021]  That's AI watching and controlling in live time what we do.
[01:50:52.021 --> 01:50:56.004]  It's not just not letting you upload a certain song and it instantly knows what the song is.
[01:50:56.004 --> 01:50:57.445]  It knows what your voice sounds like.
[01:50:57.445 --> 01:50:58.806]  It knows what your face looks like.
[01:50:58.806 --> 01:51:03.410]  It can ban Taiwanese emojis and Hong Kong flags.
[01:51:03.410 --> 01:51:06.632]  That's what's happening in live time, blocking it all.
[01:51:06.632 --> 01:51:07.172]  It's incredible.
[01:51:07.172 --> 01:51:09.354]  So I want to play part of this Tucker Carlson report.
[01:51:09.354 --> 01:51:10.055]  Please don't forget.
[01:51:11.254 --> 01:51:18.298]  If you get your order in tonight, or by tomorrow at about 2 o'clock, we'll get it shipped out anywhere in CONUS.
[01:51:18.298 --> 01:51:22.800]  Continental United States, we have total delivery in our two different delivery systems.
[01:51:22.800 --> 01:51:26.502]  By then, not to Alaska, not to Hawaii.
[01:51:26.502 --> 01:51:35.247]  But you can also put in the comments section on checkout a note as a gift, and then that way when they open the package, you can send it to friends and family and others.
[01:51:36.287 --> 01:51:46.576]  Do your last-minute shopping, they open it up and it's from InfoWars, there's some stickers, there's whatever you bought them, the book, the film, the water filtration, the air filtration, fluoride-free toothpaste.
[01:51:46.576 --> 01:51:57.205]  That's a great thing for your grandkids, works so much better than the fluoride that's gonna brain damage them, so send them Super Blue or Super Silver toothpaste, Vazo Beats is back in stock, TurboForce, BrainForce, it's all there.
[01:51:57.205 --> 01:52:02.450]  We've got a lot of great gear, a lot of great knives, a lot of great t-shirts, books.
[01:52:03.070 --> 01:52:06.072]  InfoWarsTore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:52:06.072 --> 01:52:10.055]  Storewide free shipping, double Patriot points on your next order.
[01:52:10.055 --> 01:52:14.157]  Sign up for auto shipping, an additional 10% off the current order.
[01:52:14.157 --> 01:52:15.278]  Some of these are lost leaders.
[01:52:15.278 --> 01:52:20.402]  We need to sell everything out at the end of the year to not pay inventory tax and things to be able to fund ourselves in the next year.
[01:52:20.402 --> 01:52:23.123]  So thank you all for your Christmas shopping at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:52:23.123 --> 01:52:28.127]  I cannot stress to you enough how big a deal that is and how funding this operation is game-changing.
[01:52:28.127 --> 01:52:30.148]  They cannot stand the fact we're on the air.
[01:52:30.148 --> 01:52:31.989]  I'm risking my life doing this, so is Matt Bracken.
[01:52:31.989 --> 01:52:32.490]  This is not
[01:52:33.350 --> 01:52:34.051]  Children's work.
[01:52:34.051 --> 01:52:37.053]  This is not Sunshine Patriot.
[01:52:37.053 --> 01:52:38.874]  This is winter soldier stuff.
[01:52:38.874 --> 01:52:43.957]  This is military stuff we're doing for the Republic as grassroots independent people.
[01:52:43.957 --> 01:52:44.857]  Okay?
[01:52:44.857 --> 01:52:49.500]  And more and more, the Justice Department and the military is coming over to America's side.
[01:52:49.500 --> 01:52:51.481]  We're digging the globalists out right now.
[01:52:51.481 --> 01:52:53.402]  It's been the grassroots doing it.
[01:52:53.402 --> 01:52:57.345]  But they're more and more behind the eight ball every day and they need to stage big events.
[01:52:57.345 --> 01:52:59.026]  Now, I don't have time to play the full report.
[01:52:59.798 --> 01:53:08.011]  It's super powerful, but here's some of what Tucker Carlson lays out to understand what we're up against with the Koch brothers and others.
[01:53:08.011 --> 01:53:10.054]  The left are always claiming a funded me.
[01:53:10.054 --> 01:53:11.556]  Never any money.
[01:53:11.556 --> 01:53:13.660]  But of course, really running the left as well.
[01:53:13.660 --> 01:53:14.481]  They are the deep state.
[01:53:14.481 --> 01:53:14.781]  Here it is.
[01:53:17.574 --> 01:53:27.638]  We've told you a lot on this show over the past few years about how Google, Facebook, and Twitter work in secret to impose a left-wing political agenda on this country.
[01:53:27.638 --> 01:53:33.521]  In 2016, for example, Google employees worked behind the scenes to boost Hillary Clinton's voter turnout.
[01:53:33.521 --> 01:53:36.822]  They seemed despondent when they couldn't stop Donald Trump from winning.
[01:53:37.322 --> 01:53:42.068]  Google, as you well know, regularly suppresses conservative videos on YouTube.
[01:53:42.068 --> 01:53:49.797]  At one point, the company even contemplated rigging its search results to undermine Trump's immigration policy.
[01:53:49.797 --> 01:53:56.364]  Twitter, meanwhile, and you know this well, often bans users entirely for the crime of disagreeing with the left.
[01:53:57.245 --> 01:54:03.728]  At this point, it is very clear that big tech hates conservatives and works assiduously to harm them.
[01:54:03.728 --> 01:54:07.070]  Republican voters are starting to figure this out.
[01:54:07.070 --> 01:54:13.973]  A Harris poll from last year found that 83% of Republicans understand that tech is biased against conservatives.
[01:54:13.973 --> 01:54:24.918]  Another poll this summer found that 42% of all voters, not just conservatives, believe the Trump administration should take action to push back against the tech monopoly's political bias.
[01:54:25.816 --> 01:54:28.198]  And yet, so far, that's not happening.
[01:54:28.198 --> 01:54:32.321]  No one in Washington is doing anything to rein these companies in.
[01:54:32.321 --> 01:54:34.022]  But it doesn't have to be that way.
[01:54:34.022 --> 01:54:36.884]  There are a lot of things you could do if you wanted to.
[01:54:36.884 --> 01:54:46.251]  For example, tech companies have thrived under a special immunity they received from Congress that protects them from lawsuits over what people say on their platform.
[01:54:46.251 --> 01:54:50.154]  It's an exemption that Fox News, for example, does not have.
[01:54:50.974 --> 01:54:52.675]  So why does Google have it?
[01:54:52.675 --> 01:54:54.615]  Senator Josh Hawley would like to know the answer.
[01:54:54.615 --> 01:55:05.298]  Hawley has proposed stripping that immunity from tech companies and treating them like everyone else, unless they can maintain neutral platforms for all views, which of course was the original deal they struck.
[01:55:05.298 --> 01:55:08.419]  That's a great idea, but it hasn't happened.
[01:55:08.419 --> 01:55:16.721]  Another idea is breaking up major tech companies so that a handful of monopolies don't have effective veto power over the First Amendment, which is where we are today.
[01:55:16.721 --> 01:55:19.562]  It's another great idea, but again, it hasn't happened.
[01:55:20.483 --> 01:55:23.227]  Why all the inaction on these questions?
[01:55:23.227 --> 01:55:32.963]  Well, a big part of the problem is that conservative non-profits here in Washington, the ones that are supposed to be looking out for you, aren't actually looking out for you.
[01:55:32.963 --> 01:55:34.485]  They're looking out for big tech.
[01:55:35.566 --> 01:55:41.991]  A new report from the Campaign for Accountability, obtained by this show, highlights how conservative organizations in D.C.
[01:55:41.991 --> 01:55:48.777]  have colluded with big tech to shield left-wing monopolies from any oversight at all.
[01:55:48.777 --> 01:55:51.959]  It's an amazing story, and it's happening now.
[01:55:51.959 --> 01:56:03.829]  This October, for example, Americans for Prosperity, that's a purportedly conservative group controlled by the billionaire Koch families, launched an ad supporting Facebook and Google.
[01:56:04.529 --> 01:56:07.673]  Again, not attacking, supporting Facebook and Google.
[01:56:07.673 --> 01:56:15.161]  The ads they ran targeted state attorneys general, Republican and Democrat, who were leading antitrust investigations into those two companies.
[01:56:16.167 --> 01:56:30.758]  In March, Americans for Prosperity ran digital ads urging members of the Senate Judiciary Committee to, quote, oppose any effort to use antitrust laws to break up America's innovative tech companies, end quote.
[01:56:30.758 --> 01:56:39.905]  In all, the Koch network quietly spent at least $10 million defending Silicon Valley companies that work to silence conservatives.
[01:56:40.706 --> 01:56:49.273]  The richest companies in the world being defended by a conservative non-profit as they attack conservatives.
[01:56:49.273 --> 01:56:59.601]  He then goes into how Big Tech is paying them off and paying off a lot of the little talk show hosts and people as well, like Ben Shapiro.
[01:56:59.601 --> 01:57:07.427]  So when you hear them saying all that, you wonder why Michael Savage is taking off the radio and Ben Shapiro is put in, into his very slot by the very same group.
[01:57:07.427 --> 01:57:10.009]  It's because it's a takeover.
[01:57:10.882 --> 01:57:16.589]  And they're doing it in front of everybody in big tech to help Communist China build their surveillance system and control system.
[01:57:16.589 --> 01:57:18.151]  So that's who they are.
[01:57:18.151 --> 01:57:22.256]  They put us all in camps just like the Chinese and put their people if they can get away with it.
[01:57:22.256 --> 01:57:26.040]  They're monsters that hide behind liberalism and all this garbage.
[01:57:27.173 --> 01:57:29.154]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[01:57:29.154 --> 01:57:31.955]  Only way these reports get out is you sharing them.
[01:57:31.955 --> 01:57:34.776]  Band.videos, where you find the live feeds, please share them.
[01:57:34.776 --> 01:57:37.877]  We have the huge Epstein breaking news tomorrow on the weekday show.

[01:57:39.957 --> 01:57:41.498]  That's how we're going to beat these monsters.
[01:57:41.498 --> 01:57:42.338]  We can do it.
[01:57:42.338 --> 01:57:43.599]  Thank you and God bless you all.
[01:57:43.599 --> 01:57:44.199]  Have a great Christmas.
