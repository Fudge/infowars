[00:00.000 --> 00:07.840]  cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio
[00:07.840 --> 00:32.800]  network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. I talked some about this
[00:32.800 --> 00:37.800]  yesterday on the broadcast but I didn't spend as much time on it as I wanted to
[00:37.800 --> 00:46.560]  so early in this first hour today I want to spend some time on this Wednesday
[00:46.560 --> 00:54.720]  edition the 16th day of April 2008 on a cover story in the local paper here in
[00:54.720 --> 01:00.640]  Austin, Texas headlined everything must go and it shows a picture of the
[01:00.640 --> 01:05.480]  Constitution being ripped in half and burned and it says you can look behind
[01:05.480 --> 01:09.720]  the Constitution is just being removed as the evil terrorist it says how to
[01:09.720 --> 01:16.120]  fight terrorism so it is so the images as they burn away the Constitution that
[01:16.120 --> 01:21.560]  helps them fight terrorism and it says everything must go and they go on to say
[01:21.560 --> 01:25.400]  and it's a positive article endorsing getting rid of the Bill of Rights
[01:25.400 --> 01:32.480]  Constitution and handing full control over to global corporations and that the
[01:32.480 --> 01:36.000]  people will be represented through non-governmental organizations that
[01:36.000 --> 01:41.400]  themselves are funded by the corporations this is a manifesto of open
[01:41.400 --> 01:47.040]  complete tyranny but if you read the council on foreign relations documents
[01:47.040 --> 01:52.520]  or you see what the CIA is up to I mean they always wrap themselves in the
[01:52.520 --> 02:00.200]  flags but these people hate this country and they hate sovereignty and they love
[02:00.200 --> 02:03.960]  using this nation as their bulldog to go out and attack innocent defenseless
[02:03.960 --> 02:10.120]  countries but this is a Bilderberg group CFR member who we've covered before and
[02:10.120 --> 02:17.520]  he in the past has headed up the LBJ school public affairs he's big law
[02:17.520 --> 02:23.480]  professor as well at another university and I just I'm just so sick of these
[02:23.480 --> 02:29.000]  people I mean they are criminals they are traitors they are treasonous and I
[02:29.000 --> 02:35.440]  mean those words when you are calling for the government to abolish the Bill
[02:35.440 --> 02:39.920]  of Rights Constitution and for there to be no liberty or freedom you are a
[02:39.920 --> 02:48.360]  treasonous piece of trash I mean you can as a citizen you can call for this to
[02:48.360 --> 02:51.640]  be Nazi Germany if you want or you can call for this to be Mexico if you want
[02:51.640 --> 02:57.040]  though those are distasteful things still you have a right to do it but when
[02:57.040 --> 03:02.200]  you are in governmental and quasi-governmental positions and you
[03:02.200 --> 03:09.120]  preach this type of sedition I just want these people to get out of this
[03:09.120 --> 03:14.160]  country but they won't their parasites they're in control and they put out one
[03:14.160 --> 03:17.280]  brand of propaganda for the general public and then they put another brand of
[03:17.280 --> 03:23.000]  propaganda for the intellectuals but this is a throwing down of the gauntlet a
[03:23.000 --> 03:28.720]  slapping in the face a punching us in the face repeatedly with extreme
[03:28.720 --> 03:41.960]  pleasure and I for one have just had enough of it I for one just am frankly
[03:41.960 --> 03:51.680]  I feel weak I feel pathetic I feel like I'm living in a nightmare I mean I know
[03:51.680 --> 03:55.760]  that I have power personally I know all of us have the spirit of the universe in
[03:55.760 --> 04:00.760]  us I know we're wonderful beautiful creatures but at the same time that
[04:00.760 --> 04:04.480]  makes even more frustrating because I know we could turn things around we could
[04:04.480 --> 04:08.440]  take things back from these people but so many individuals that make a hundred
[04:08.440 --> 04:11.040]  thousand two hundred thousand three hundred thousand four hundred thousand
[04:11.040 --> 04:15.920]  dollars a year millions of Americans they think they're part of the system and
[04:15.920 --> 04:20.160]  they've learned how to kiss hind in and serve the system and they don't really
[04:20.160 --> 04:24.920]  know what they're serving most of them are nice people but they empower this
[04:24.920 --> 04:30.200]  beast a beast that's carrying out eugenics against them and their families
[04:30.200 --> 04:36.720]  at point blank range so I will break this down we'll get into a bunch of
[04:36.720 --> 04:44.520]  financial news serious developments there we will get into a bunch of other
[04:44.520 --> 04:49.720]  world news stay with us we'll be right back Israel saying the US is getting

[05:27.200 --> 05:31.360]  secret that drives the entire new world order agenda the old Americans make a

[07:50.080 --> 08:00.080]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:00.080 --> 08:24.440]  thank you for joining us today we've got a guest coming up in about 20 minutes
[08:24.440 --> 08:30.560]  who's going to discuss how the democratic convention is going to be held this
[08:30.560 --> 08:39.800]  year they are not allowing anybody to demonstrate unless they authorize it and
[08:39.800 --> 08:44.760]  then hundreds of groups go and put in for a lottery and then one group is
[08:44.760 --> 08:49.760]  allowed to demonstrate in a small pen now that's the opposite of a first
[08:49.760 --> 08:52.840]  amendment that's the opposite of the United States and our entire heritage
[08:52.840 --> 08:58.360]  and our law but it doesn't matter major states are announcing there's no more
[08:58.360 --> 09:02.920]  fourth amendment they'll spy on whoever they want without warrants to it's just
[09:02.920 --> 09:08.080]  wall-to-wall government lawlessness I went and paid the supposed income taxes
[09:08.080 --> 09:12.120]  the private federal reserve yesterday and violated my own fifth amendment
[09:12.120 --> 09:17.560]  right incriminating myself and a tax code designed so they can selectively
[09:17.560 --> 09:22.360]  enforce on whoever they wish and then I was at a meeting last night at about 10
[09:22.360 --> 09:27.920]  o'clock and I was a driving downtown and I was in traffic that was moving
[09:27.920 --> 09:33.720]  slowly across the congress bridge that is a 35 mile an hour speed limit and a
[09:33.720 --> 09:36.720]  cop pulls me over and he says that didn't you see me behind you I said no he
[09:36.720 --> 09:41.720]  goes well you were speeding and I kind of analyzed that in my head and I looked
[09:41.720 --> 09:51.360]  at him and I said really I was speeding I was speeding and I had some friends who
[09:51.360 --> 09:56.040]  were traveling behind me and they had noticed the cop I hadn't and I had pulled
[09:56.040 --> 10:00.400]  up beside him and saw him behind me basically you know running people's
[10:00.400 --> 10:07.760]  plates probably mine and I guess that's the the fun game is to just and he had
[10:07.760 --> 10:12.760]  his light shining at my car but I did get a decent look at it and I believe
[10:12.760 --> 10:18.240]  the the issue was he had and I know some of the Austin cruisers have this that
[10:18.240 --> 10:22.720]  Houston has it Dallas has it Austin has a few I don't know I saw when they were
[10:22.720 --> 10:27.480]  testing five of them a few years ago I'm sure they've got more now as they
[10:27.480 --> 10:31.960]  always buy more where it just reads everybody's license plates as it drives
[10:31.960 --> 10:38.880]  on the road and I guess it was fun to pull over Alex Jones and I said how much
[10:38.880 --> 10:43.400]  was I speeding oh five miles over the speed limit that's right now it's five
[10:43.400 --> 10:47.240]  miles over you see in the past it was five six miles over they don't pull you
[10:47.240 --> 10:50.680]  over but I'm pretty soon if you're one mile over the speed limit they'll
[10:50.680 --> 10:54.280]  probably be a fifty thousand dollar fine you'll probably go to Guantanamo Bay
[10:54.280 --> 11:00.840]  but illegal aliens can be drinking and driving and legal aliens can get free
[11:00.840 --> 11:05.800]  health care citizens don't but the corporations are above the law too there
[11:05.800 --> 11:10.040]  was a AP article yesterday admitting that big corporations don't really get
[11:10.040 --> 11:14.320]  audited and don't pay much taxes anymore and in fact I meant to cover that it was
[11:14.320 --> 11:18.160]  in the stack yesterday but it's just all selectively enforced it's that's how
[11:18.160 --> 11:23.400]  everything works now today I saw a nice fellow on my MySpace saying hey Alex
[11:23.400 --> 11:29.840]  stop bashing the brainwashed Mexicans it makes us tough on us Mexicans you
[11:29.840 --> 11:37.000]  know I'm not against Mexicans I like Mexicans they like me I'm not into what
[11:37.000 --> 11:39.960]  color people are but I am into the fact that a lot of people that are different
[11:39.960 --> 11:44.040]  colors for me don't like me and I'm sure that you're different color from white
[11:44.040 --> 11:49.000]  so you don't like it a lot of whites don't like you and I make no bones about
[11:49.000 --> 11:51.560]  the fact there are a lot of whites that don't like you for your skin color I
[11:51.560 --> 11:57.000]  think that's wrong I'm just saying if illegal aliens and and foreigners and
[11:57.000 --> 12:02.440]  immigrants get more tuition and citizens more health care than citizens more
[12:02.440 --> 12:11.040]  welfare than citizens are above the law don't have to have insurance I also
[12:11.040 --> 12:14.600]  showed him I said oh I don't have my new insurance car cuz you get one every six
[12:14.600 --> 12:21.120]  months for some reason I don't know why that happens from all state but I said
[12:21.120 --> 12:23.840]  oh look and it was expired by a month and he said well I'm gonna give you a
[12:23.840 --> 12:26.640]  ticket for that too and I had a whole bunch of expired ones in the glove
[12:26.640 --> 12:30.800]  compartment I said yeah I said go ahead I he said you can just go down to the
[12:30.800 --> 12:34.880]  court and there's a little fee or something or I pointed out there's a fee
[12:34.880 --> 12:39.640]  and he said yeah you just go down to the court and so you know it's not enough to
[12:39.640 --> 12:43.360]  pay the private bankers that own me and my family and they pretty much do I mean
[12:43.360 --> 12:47.320]  we I can say consciously that they don't own me but they physically do they have
[12:47.320 --> 12:50.920]  paramilitary forces that they can snap their fingers and they'll kill me and
[12:50.920 --> 12:55.360]  my family in 10 seconds they'll kill you they'll put poison in your water they'll
[12:55.360 --> 12:59.120]  put poison in your vaccines they'll spray you they'll do what they want when
[12:59.120 --> 13:07.640]  they want how they want and I don't even want to say I feel impotent but I feel
[13:07.640 --> 13:11.400]  borderline impotence the word I know we're making big in rows we're
[13:11.400 --> 13:15.280]  exposing these people and their system is being discredited but they just say
[13:15.280 --> 13:19.480]  we don't care by the way we're gonna hire another million cops and get rid of
[13:19.480 --> 13:24.360]  possecom and taught us and we're building FEMA camps and that's really what it
[13:24.360 --> 13:27.760]  comes down to we have criminals that have the high ground with brainwashed
[13:27.760 --> 13:32.080]  minions serving them who have no idea what they're part of and we're in a lot
[13:32.080 --> 13:40.840]  of trouble you know there's a big story out about aboriginal children in
[13:40.840 --> 13:45.800]  Australia being injected with leprosy watered-down leprosy quote is a
[13:45.800 --> 13:55.480]  treatment until the 1960s and people are whitewashing it and saying well it
[13:55.480 --> 14:00.720]  made it killed some of them and made some of them sick the aborigines but then
[14:00.720 --> 14:05.440]  they defend in the articles that well CPS took the children from all aboriginal
[14:05.440 --> 14:10.720]  families to indoctrinate them and it says to bring them into society kind of
[14:10.720 --> 14:14.800]  like when they say in California the state court has ruled homeschooling is
[14:14.800 --> 14:19.200]  illegal did that a month and a half ago and they said in the ruling they said
[14:19.200 --> 14:23.800]  it's it's you need to be you know what I shouldn't just talk about something
[14:23.800 --> 14:29.640]  like that I should it's in the bottom of the stack here let me just find that and
[14:29.640 --> 14:34.440]  go ahead and cover that now I want to use the exact term here it is BBC
[14:34.440 --> 14:39.640]  aborigines used in experiments some aboriginal children in Australia were
[14:39.640 --> 14:45.600]  once used for medical test it has been claimed and it says well it is they
[14:45.600 --> 14:48.080]  go and admit that well yeah the medical records show they took them and did
[14:48.080 --> 14:54.360]  experiments on them but you know it's reported like maybe it's a good job it
[14:54.360 --> 14:58.520]  says from the 19th century to the late 60s many aboriginal children were taken
[14:58.520 --> 15:02.640]  from their parents the info I've got is in many areas of the country all of them
[15:02.640 --> 15:06.040]  are taken there are a few areas where they didn't take all of them and brought
[15:06.040 --> 15:09.960]  up by white families in an attempt the government to assimilate the indigenous
[15:09.960 --> 15:15.000]  population assimilate and that's what they say in the court ruling in
[15:15.000 --> 15:19.720]  California they said well it's all part of assimilation and all part of oh
[15:19.720 --> 15:26.900]  what's the term they use it's relative to my tongue assimilation and the other
[15:26.900 --> 15:32.480]  term is oh it's the one they always use when they say that they're taking
[15:32.480 --> 15:37.760]  people's homeschoolers kids or Christians children or rural peoples or
[15:37.760 --> 15:41.360]  Appalachian children poor white children remember they're taking them usually
[15:41.360 --> 15:44.840]  using them for medical experiments too it is their favorite or poor black
[15:44.840 --> 15:51.480]  children they say that they need the interaction with other children the
[15:51.480 --> 15:57.040]  term will somebody will call in with the term but it's similar to this you know we
[15:57.040 --> 16:11.560]  the state we know best and if you want to profile the social workers you know
[16:11.560 --> 16:15.720]  when I say that the CPS workers that a lot of them are pedophiles that's
[16:15.720 --> 16:21.120]  because every day and we're not even looking for this news we see it in Texas
[16:21.120 --> 16:26.440]  in New York Florida every state where some head CPS individual or someone
[16:26.440 --> 16:33.840]  running a a foster home or the the truancy officer or the cop or the
[16:33.840 --> 16:39.760]  principal or the teacher but well I mean the federal statistics are five times
[16:39.760 --> 16:44.560]  more likely for a child to be abused the number one most dangerous place for a
[16:44.560 --> 16:50.960]  child is government custody state custody you can pull that federal numbers up if
[16:50.960 --> 16:54.280]  you want it Department of Health and Human Services and it's been on the
[16:54.280 --> 16:58.560]  cover of Time Magazine and things one issue was the shame of foster care a
[16:58.560 --> 17:04.240]  little black kid on the front beat after death but when you read this article
[17:04.240 --> 17:08.880]  the main issue is is that they kidnapped the children and sent them to
[17:08.880 --> 17:13.880]  facilities and other families who basically used them on farms and ranches
[17:13.880 --> 17:20.600]  as slave labor so there's a lot of slavery we think of blacks with yokes
[17:20.600 --> 17:26.680]  around their neck like a mule pulling a plow in a cotton field and certainly
[17:26.680 --> 17:32.720]  that went on here but most slavery is indentured type or sharecropper type
[17:32.720 --> 17:40.160]  where you live in a shack and it's not even the job legally of master to make
[17:40.160 --> 17:43.560]  sure you got enough food to eat or medicine you could get in trouble if
[17:43.560 --> 17:47.360]  you didn't take care of your black slaves but if you were the poor whites or
[17:47.360 --> 17:51.440]  others or freed blacks nobody took care of you and you were just basically
[17:51.440 --> 17:55.320]  slaves on the property and that's what the globalists want that's what they
[17:55.320 --> 18:03.040]  need that's what they're pushing for that's what they are creating and so
[18:03.040 --> 18:10.880]  hidden in plain view right here in this article is the real issue and by the way
[18:10.880 --> 18:18.320]  I remember more than 10 years ago reading about them giving them leprosy and
[18:18.320 --> 18:23.040]  testing vaccines on them and all sorts of things so you know this new thing
[18:23.040 --> 18:27.040]  about a controversial dangerous leprosy treatment you know which was a again
[18:27.040 --> 18:31.720]  watered-down version of leprosy you know did it was it abusive it was the point
[18:31.720 --> 18:37.280]  is they took their kids away and you know I point a lot to what was in the New
[18:37.280 --> 18:41.400]  York Daily News and a few other papers a few years back where because it
[18:41.400 --> 18:46.000]  described it and this was good CPS workers that did tell the truth because
[18:46.000 --> 18:50.840]  they're not all pedophiles the rest of them were because I went to college with
[18:50.840 --> 18:54.440]  them I remember talking to people that were going to school to be CPS workers
[18:54.440 --> 18:59.160]  and then I bumped into socially these people before and they'll always get
[18:59.160 --> 19:05.920]  this weird far-off look in their eyes and they'll say you know I was abused when
[19:05.920 --> 19:10.320]  I was a child my father did this and that to me and put cigarettes out on me and
[19:10.320 --> 19:13.760]  beat me and I'm not gonna let that continue to happen I'm gonna go out and
[19:13.760 --> 19:16.560]  fight these people and they get this far-off look and start talking about
[19:16.560 --> 19:21.880]  their dad or mom and they literally are mentally scarred they shouldn't be
[19:21.880 --> 19:28.200]  outdoing this and so they think everybody's an abuser and it's like I'm
[19:28.200 --> 19:33.840]  taking your children you look like my father you've got dirty dishes you're
[19:33.840 --> 19:42.280]  bad so it's a it's a it's an abuse cult so I don't know we got a bunch of
[19:42.280 --> 19:45.960]  financial news we'll get to we'll get to this call for getting rid of the
[19:45.960 --> 19:50.680]  Constitution and a lot more on the other side too
[19:52.560 --> 19:57.440]  do you know the truth about cancer treatments do you realize that with all
[19:57.440 --> 20:02.040]  presently accepted methods you are not correctly attacking the cancer and you
[20:02.040 --> 20:07.160]  are mostly fighting to survive the treatment do you realize that mutilating
[20:07.160 --> 20:12.560]  surgery burning and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary

[24:42.440 --> 24:47.200]  called in America and they call for it I mean they show a picture of the
[24:47.200 --> 24:51.760]  constitution being burned they say it's good and they say everything must go and
[24:51.760 --> 24:55.240]  that's what they do in the front page of the paper where I live they just
[24:55.240 --> 24:59.840]  celebrate the death of this country and they just sit up there in their little
[24:59.840 --> 25:04.840]  armored university fortresses guarded by their men in black uniforms and urinate
[25:04.840 --> 25:08.920]  all over us and I've just had enough of these people
[25:11.120 --> 25:16.040]  in fact I every time I read the quotes and look at the picture of the
[25:16.040 --> 25:23.400]  constitution being burned I get so mad that I it's just so over the top they're
[25:23.400 --> 25:28.880]  the enemy they're declared enemies of this country and everybody kisses their
[25:28.880 --> 25:33.560]  hind in everybody worships them and grovels to them and they just feed on
[25:33.560 --> 25:42.600]  us and suck off of us and let me tell you something they beta tested taking
[25:42.600 --> 25:48.440]  people's kids and testing drugs on them and everything on the blacks and the
[25:48.440 --> 25:56.160]  Mexicans and the Asians in this country and in other nations on whatever the
[25:56.160 --> 26:01.760]  minority group is but their real target is everybody and you need to understand
[26:01.760 --> 26:05.880]  that that that we're all being attacked we're all going through this and I never
[26:05.880 --> 26:12.040]  finished talking about New York City what had been admitted in New York you can
[26:12.040 --> 26:15.760]  pull it up foster children you know drugs tested on them most articles you
[26:15.760 --> 26:19.200]  find are the whitewash about how kids that didn't even have AIDS well first
[26:19.200 --> 26:24.400]  you'll find articles hundreds of them they kind of smoke screen it with the
[26:24.400 --> 26:28.360]  lesser evil that's one of their favorite tactics about a well they take kids that
[26:28.360 --> 26:34.440]  had AIDS or HIV and test experimental highly toxic drugs that are basically
[26:34.440 --> 26:38.880]  chemotherapies on them and then how some of them got sick and died and then you
[26:38.880 --> 26:45.080]  read deeper and you'll find in a few news articles out of New York and in the
[26:45.080 --> 26:48.960]  police reports and others and in advocacy groups that have the documents
[26:48.960 --> 26:53.280]  posted on their sites and that no no it was children that didn't have HIV they
[26:53.280 --> 26:58.080]  test the drugs on they die and then you find out that thousands of children in
[26:58.080 --> 27:05.840]  New York City alone in the last decade would have pesticides tested on them
[27:05.840 --> 27:10.920]  till they die and I remember crying on air I can't help but I broke down one
[27:10.920 --> 27:15.200]  day because I was reading a New York Daily News article it's about three
[27:15.200 --> 27:22.480]  years ago and it talked about this little eight-year-old black boy and it
[27:22.480 --> 27:26.840]  gave us a name and a CPS worker went public with this is the only reason it
[27:26.840 --> 27:30.400]  came out and the article though kind of debated whether it was okay which was
[27:30.400 --> 27:34.120]  amazing and then it said that they went to the black mother and they said we're
[27:34.120 --> 27:38.160]  gonna take your two-year-old if you don't give us the eight-year-old we decided
[27:38.160 --> 27:42.680]  your house isn't safe just sign him over and agree the mother of course didn't
[27:42.680 --> 27:47.560]  know it's false consent they intimidate you into it and say well you consented
[27:47.560 --> 27:52.760]  it's a little lawyer trick and it said they took the little black boy and then
[27:52.760 --> 27:57.480]  for the next two months gave him dosages and in the first he could he could walk
[27:57.480 --> 28:01.240]  and you know they had him in a cell and then he had to be in a bed and then he
[28:01.240 --> 28:06.440]  couldn't talk and then they gave him pesticide till he died that's just one
[28:06.440 --> 28:13.560]  person gave him pesticide till he died and he was taken to a government slash
[28:13.560 --> 28:22.080]  private pharma facility where they test on foster children I mean just you kill
[28:22.080 --> 28:27.920]  little kids and nobody can go to jail for that but you can pull me over for
[28:27.920 --> 28:34.200]  going five miles over the speed limit can't you cops yeah you can and you'll
[28:34.200 --> 28:38.800]  probably win you'll probably kill me or put me in prison you always win don't you

[33:35.120 --> 33:42.240]  that owns the country and then that's not a perboly that's really who you pay
[33:42.240 --> 33:46.280]  your taxes to I'm not just calling them a private crime syndicate I mean that's
[33:46.280 --> 33:52.640]  who runs and rules us all we are property of I guess better men I mean
[33:52.640 --> 33:57.160]  we're their slaves we could try to revolt against them in the info war but
[33:57.160 --> 34:04.680]  you know the CPA had and with data importing and there were some mistakes
[34:04.680 --> 34:08.960]  and we had to fix it and then they didn't have time to certify it so I was
[34:08.960 --> 34:12.640]  filing an extension and I'm just sitting there grumbling and griping about it and
[34:12.640 --> 34:22.600]  my dad was helping me after he got off work and he said look his uncle and his
[34:22.600 --> 34:29.440]  dad's brother who my dad's attached to I'm I like him to uncle Leonard all the
[34:29.440 --> 34:34.360]  sudden was an excruciating pain and had all these blockages in between his
[34:34.360 --> 34:38.600]  liver and gallbladder and a bunch of other things and they found out he had a
[34:38.600 --> 34:44.520]  big tumor in their cancer so he had to have this emergency surgery so my dad
[34:44.520 --> 34:49.520]  drove down there a few days ago and he came out of the seven-hour surgery okay
[34:49.520 --> 34:55.960]  thank God and my dad is you know sitting there for a day and he said that there
[34:55.960 --> 35:00.920]  was this nice good-looking young professional family sitting out there
[35:00.920 --> 35:05.960]  and they were really really sad and then my dad was sitting right next to him
[35:05.960 --> 35:10.400]  and he had to watch the the doctor come out in the waiting room and say well
[35:10.400 --> 35:17.320]  your your four-year-old has an operable brain tumor and will be dead in four
[35:17.320 --> 35:23.360]  weeks and then he sat there listening to how they love this little boy so much
[35:23.360 --> 35:27.600]  and how he'd grown up and he ran around and played and was so happy and
[35:27.600 --> 35:32.200]  everybody loved him and he just you know had just that magic love of life in
[35:32.200 --> 35:38.240]  him and then he started bumping into things and fallen down and then he
[35:38.240 --> 35:42.320]  couldn't even go to the bathroom and you know by then they pretty much knew
[35:42.320 --> 35:45.920]  something was wrong and they took him in and it was a brain tumor and fast
[35:45.920 --> 35:53.520]  growing this just happened in a few weeks so you know what the world is filled
[35:53.520 --> 36:00.760]  with a lot of pain and a lot of bad things are happening a lot of really
[36:00.760 --> 36:05.160]  painful things are going on and every single one of us better thank God every
[36:05.160 --> 36:11.800]  day thank the maker every day that we are alive that we have consciousness that
[36:11.800 --> 36:16.920]  our children are healthy that our parents are healthy or even alive you know
[36:16.920 --> 36:21.280]  these unhappy people that have nice houses cars vacations and they're totally
[36:21.280 --> 36:27.360]  unhappy then you see some poor child in Latin America or in Africa or in Asia or
[36:27.360 --> 36:33.680]  in India drinking their morning water out of a fetid you know sewage filled river
[36:33.680 --> 36:38.680]  and they have just got glowing eyes and their souls are electrified and they
[36:38.680 --> 36:42.800]  have these happy smiles on their faces because they haven't had their souls
[36:42.800 --> 36:47.160]  stolen by the television in Madison Avenue and this decadent culture and
[36:47.160 --> 36:54.240]  just all the evil that is around us and I just couldn't imagine my children
[36:54.240 --> 37:00.440]  dying of a brain tumor or being about to die and that's why we come on air and
[37:00.440 --> 37:06.400]  speak out against GMO foods in every major study including studies done by the
[37:06.400 --> 37:16.280]  GMO companies monkeys guinea pigs rats and many other forms of mammals all get
[37:16.280 --> 37:25.040]  tumors all over their bodies they all end up dying early and scientists had
[37:25.040 --> 37:30.960]  previously thought that mutation generally only happened in utero and then
[37:30.960 --> 37:33.800]  the major deformities that were fast-acting were were due to birth
[37:33.800 --> 37:40.760]  defects were due to genetics but now they're finding that these foods can can
[37:40.760 --> 37:45.200]  cause not just cancers but mutations and mutation to different types of growths
[37:45.200 --> 37:52.720]  while you are even young you know before your DNA starts malfunctioning from
[37:52.720 --> 37:58.040]  cell damage toxins solar radiation all of it that breaks up our DNA I mean
[37:58.040 --> 38:02.600]  there's no doubt your children when they eat GMO food that's chimera across
[38:02.600 --> 38:06.080]  species altered there's no doubt it's hurting them bad you just think
[38:06.080 --> 38:09.680]  everybody's got allergies for nothing you think everybody no matter how much
[38:09.680 --> 38:21.000]  the exercise still feels like crap for nothing and don't think it won't happen
[38:21.000 --> 38:28.280]  to you the toxins the poisons the things that is yesterday associated press
[38:28.280 --> 38:32.480]  reported the feds are blocking funding to further investigate why every major
[38:32.480 --> 38:38.840]  water supply has hundreds of drugs and chemicals in it and they've also found
[38:38.840 --> 38:43.760]  it's at levels that the scientists are saying shouldn't be from urine shouldn't
[38:43.760 --> 38:49.520]  be from from people's waste they're finding it levels much higher they're
[38:49.520 --> 38:53.280]  putting the stuff in the water because the things they find that just so happen
[38:53.280 --> 39:01.800]  to be off the charts are the serotonin reuptake inhibitors I'm not gonna sit
[39:01.800 --> 39:09.000]  here and preach anymore I just I am really I'm willing to give up my life and
[39:09.000 --> 39:14.640]  this is nothing special is what so we have become so sick we're about to go to
[39:14.640 --> 39:20.480]  our guest I am willing to give up my life I mean if I saw the classic
[39:20.480 --> 39:27.480]  hypothetical ticking time bomb scenario you know of a child is about doesn't see
[39:27.480 --> 39:34.760]  a boss and is about to be hit by it would I jump out in front of the bus to
[39:34.760 --> 39:39.720]  knock the kid out of the way and I can say that I would do that I know I would
[39:39.720 --> 39:48.800]  do that but it isn't because I am even a good person my instincts are intact
[39:48.800 --> 39:55.160]  they have not been removed and that's the instinct of what a male especially is
[39:55.160 --> 39:59.200]  supposed to do I mean that's why men are tougher and stronger and the guardians
[39:59.200 --> 40:05.360]  of the tribe we're here to die in defense of the women and children we're
[40:05.360 --> 40:11.760]  here to sacrifice we're here to work hard and instead we're a bunch of men who
[40:11.760 --> 40:21.320]  act tough act studly strut around bugging their eyes out but literally cringe
[40:21.320 --> 40:26.760]  and shake when a cop pulls them over I've seen it but they'll boss their
[40:26.760 --> 40:30.360]  neighbor around and act tough at the mailbox to the to the runt neighbor
[40:30.360 --> 40:35.960]  you know you don't care about your kids you don't care about anything you just
[40:35.960 --> 40:40.080]  care about strutting around acting tough and it's shameful that you won't be real
[40:40.080 --> 40:46.440]  man it's shameful that you think a man being a man is about how many women you
[40:46.440 --> 40:50.920]  can have sex with well it is in the primitive sense but then it means taking
[40:50.920 --> 40:57.480]  care of those women and kids and oh you forgot that part and when people come
[40:57.480 --> 41:01.320]  over the next hill want to take what you got going in there and fighting to the
[41:01.320 --> 41:08.120]  death against them and you just have had all that taken away from you and you
[41:08.120 --> 41:12.520]  have been gelted okay I'm gonna shut up I appreciate Jonathan Ellen off for
[41:12.520 --> 41:17.600]  joining us you sure talk about two issues they have repeatedly talked to Gary
[41:17.600 --> 41:24.280]  Hart and that of course is one of the top counsel on fine relations strategic
[41:24.280 --> 41:27.400]  planners in the Hart-Rubin Commission they wrote the Homeland Security plan
[41:27.400 --> 41:31.280]  years before we were attacked they said we'd be attacked they said use this
[41:31.280 --> 41:42.080]  disaster to create a new world order and he also wrote a letter to he wrote a
[41:42.080 --> 41:47.000]  letter to Iran last year saying the US government stages terror attacks and
[41:47.000 --> 41:51.440]  we'll stage one again you better do it we say don't think was it because 80% of
[41:51.440 --> 41:54.640]  the public are against attacking you that we won't do it we stage events he
[41:54.640 --> 41:59.440]  went through listing them I mean these these guys are just out in the open but
[41:59.440 --> 42:04.840]  then when you raise these points they just deny it kind of like if you went
[42:04.840 --> 42:11.400]  confronted professor Bob at the fellow at UT involved in NSA everything else
[42:11.400 --> 42:18.840]  you can imagine University of Texas senior fellow Philip Bob it if you go
[42:18.840 --> 42:23.240]  and you talk to him he would just deny all the things but in the paper they
[42:23.240 --> 42:26.280]  said everything must go get rid of the Constitution and then put a picture of
[42:26.280 --> 42:30.400]  the Constitution burning and said it was a good thing but that but that's an
[42:30.400 --> 42:35.400]  enemy operation that that's understood they're a soldier sneaking up on your
[42:35.400 --> 42:39.600]  position and if you walk over to them in camouflage in the rice patty and say
[42:39.600 --> 42:44.240]  are you a soldier with an AK-47 it's gonna sneak up to my foxhole and throw a
[42:44.240 --> 42:49.240]  hanger Nate in they'll say oh no I'm not and then you'll go oh well thank you
[42:49.240 --> 42:52.480]  and just keep wander back to your foxhole so they can come up and throw a
[42:52.480 --> 42:58.400]  hanger Nate in just a military tactic they even say now on local news
[42:58.400 --> 43:03.480]  Trans-Texas corridor doesn't exist you can look it up I mean you know it's all
[43:03.480 --> 43:08.440]  over the billboards are up they're doing it it doesn't matter and the this is
[43:08.440 --> 43:13.920]  psychological warfare where they say we're getting rid of America but then
[43:13.920 --> 43:17.960]  it's to protect America Jonathan the Ellen officer to talk about that but
[43:17.960 --> 43:24.560]  also they put in to go to the Democratic National Convention and I looked
[43:24.560 --> 43:27.280]  this up after they called us and told somebody yesterday and sure enough we
[43:27.280 --> 43:32.080]  did a lot of research and Jason Burmes is here in town doing some work with us
[43:32.080 --> 43:35.560]  he's already knew about a weeks ago I learned we went to the website and
[43:35.560 --> 43:39.560]  basically they're hiring anarchist they're gonna have them in these clown
[43:39.560 --> 43:48.480]  outfits with body armor shields and bank robber mask little you know over their
[43:48.480 --> 43:54.840]  eyes and they are the group the only group out of hundreds that tried because
[43:54.840 --> 43:58.080]  you know oh you have a First Amendment you come to us and there's a lottery and
[43:58.080 --> 44:03.560]  then we decide if you can protest and they said oh yes this group got the
[44:03.560 --> 44:07.560]  lottery oh and then the Democratic Party magically got won the lottery to get
[44:07.560 --> 44:11.640]  fabricated to yep sure you believe that I got a bridge I want to sell you and so
[44:11.640 --> 44:17.280]  they will zoom into Democratic operatives dressed up to look like
[44:17.280 --> 44:26.040]  idiots throwing things at cops Jonathan break it down for us Alex good to be on
[44:26.040 --> 44:28.560]  your show I should also well good to have you I should also add you're the
[44:28.560 --> 44:34.200]  founder we are change Colorado tell us what's happening well I'm gonna I'm gonna
[44:34.200 --> 44:39.960]  focus on recreate 68 here the organizer Glenn Spagnolo we talked with him on
[44:39.960 --> 44:44.160]  Sunday at his community meeting and I asked him are you planning any kind of
[44:44.160 --> 44:48.560]  you know direct violent confrontations anything that can get you arrested and
[44:48.560 --> 44:52.200]  he said quote oh we're gonna good we're gonna get arrested we're already
[44:52.200 --> 44:55.400]  planning on getting arrested the question is how long they're gonna hold us on the
[44:55.400 --> 45:00.880]  left side it says smash people's cameras smash citizens cameras I mean it's all
[45:00.880 --> 45:06.640]  meant and of course to make protesters look bad right and I and I I advise them
[45:06.640 --> 45:10.280]  I said are you familiar with you know being violent and this kind of behavior
[45:10.280 --> 45:14.080]  is gonna get people arrested and he said well you know that's only gonna get us
[45:14.080 --> 45:17.960]  dressed I said well the police see you doing it and you're leading the group the
[45:17.960 --> 45:22.720]  whole group's gonna be this way and the way they've set it up is any activist
[45:22.720 --> 45:26.480]  group that's coming into Denver is falling under recreate 68 because they've
[45:26.480 --> 45:29.920]  given an open invite to them and they've actually gone out and contacted
[45:29.920 --> 45:34.000]  activist groups and told them that they have to be with them which is not true
[45:34.000 --> 45:38.600]  they've contacted Greenpeace code pink Iraq veterans against the war
[45:38.600 --> 45:42.920]  everybody you name the activist group that's coming to Denver to protest
[45:42.920 --> 45:46.960]  they're all under this umbrella recreate 68 and what they don't know yet is that
[45:46.960 --> 45:52.680]  this recreate 68 is planning to sabotage all the efforts done now I don't
[45:52.680 --> 45:57.720]  know if if they realize that what they're doing is and I don't know and I
[45:57.720 --> 46:02.080]  don't know of a bear poops in the woods but go ahead I mean it's I mean I'm
[46:02.080 --> 46:05.720]  prepared to make you know these what they're doing is going to endanger the
[46:05.720 --> 46:09.040]  security and the safety of peaceful demonstrator well did you see Seattle or
[46:09.040 --> 46:12.920]  they bust in 50 people from a paramilitary Ford Foundation training
[46:12.920 --> 46:17.080]  camp and the police guarded them in their own compound and then they allowed
[46:17.080 --> 46:20.440]  them to attack cops cops were told to stand down and then the cops attacked the
[46:20.440 --> 46:23.960]  peaceful people of course it's staged now what we saw what we just saw what
[46:23.960 --> 46:27.400]  happened in Canada where it was the cops attacking themselves in a staged event
[46:27.400 --> 46:31.000]  that's now admitted now the key here is though that they're claiming there's
[46:31.000 --> 46:37.160]  this lottery but magically this group got the lottery right they issued
[46:37.160 --> 46:42.720]  permits for the free speech zone and you had to apply for this lottery it was
[46:42.720 --> 46:47.280]  supposed to be a blind lottery of course the big anti-war protest they
[46:47.280 --> 46:51.560]  weren't issued their permit for the city of Denver got their permit you don't
[46:51.560 --> 46:56.360]  need a permit that government is criminal and anti-american exactly how
[46:56.360 --> 46:59.960]  this works folks it's just like gun control first they say in New York oh
[46:59.960 --> 47:03.760]  you can have a gun but you got to get a permit and then they don't issue the
[47:03.760 --> 47:08.320]  permit anymore well it's the same thing with this you can't do that with our
[47:08.320 --> 47:13.920]  First Amendment you criminals go ahead right and and the thing is is you know
[47:13.920 --> 47:18.800]  they've they've started this massive the articles up on truthaliance.net by the
[47:18.800 --> 47:21.480]  way if you want to see if anyone wants to see a full background of what we are
[47:21.480 --> 47:26.840]  able to find on them and basically this group used to be known as the Denver
[47:26.840 --> 47:33.600]  Action Network during the globalization protest back in 99 there was the Dan
[47:33.600 --> 47:37.600]  groups and the two who organized the Denver Action Network were Barb and
[47:37.600 --> 47:43.440]  Mark Cohen who happened to be the two coordinators of recreate 68 now they
[47:43.440 --> 47:47.960]  were responsible back in 2000 for having people arrested thrown in hospitals
[47:47.960 --> 47:52.840]  thrown in jail that we heard from a big protest at Coles I broke the story on
[47:52.840 --> 47:56.560]  truthaliance.net it's there we were able to confirm and I asked them about it
[47:56.560 --> 48:02.680]  they don't want to comment on it but I said basically what the story was is the
[48:02.680 --> 48:07.120]  Denver Justice Peace Coalition was down there protesting outside of a coal to
[48:07.120 --> 48:10.880]  which they showed up inspired all the young kids they had the larger issue is
[48:10.880 --> 48:14.840]  this is what's happening the feds go set this up they use their operatives as a
[48:14.840 --> 48:18.360]  front that's why they're contacting all the groups and saying show up in our
[48:18.360 --> 48:22.000]  free speech zone is an attempt to co-op the entire peace movement which has
[48:22.000 --> 48:26.080]  already co-opted all over the place it isn't just this group and then they
[48:26.080 --> 48:29.560]  plan to have you all there so the anarchist can run around then they'll
[48:29.560 --> 48:33.480]  step aside on video the cops will give the nod you'll even see the anarchist
[48:33.480 --> 48:36.440]  they'll they'll they'll give the nod they'll be an anarchist cop leading it
[48:36.440 --> 48:40.200]  he'll step aside rubber bullets will be fired at the peaceful people strollers
[48:40.200 --> 48:46.400]  will be attacked like in Portland in places and it's a total black off the
[48:46.400 --> 48:48.960]  group should show up at different places everybody should do whatever they
[48:48.960 --> 48:54.160]  want don't follow orders protest however you want right and they're they're they
[48:54.160 --> 48:58.640]  have a whole demonstration itinerary and that you have an itinerary for the
[48:58.640 --> 49:02.200]  cops of course right and what happened back in 2000 results of the ACLU
[49:02.200 --> 49:06.400]  filing lawsuits against the city of golden because that vandalism that they
[49:06.400 --> 49:10.760]  did to that Cole's department store resulted in the Denver police allowing
[49:10.760 --> 49:16.240]  to get warrants and label DJ PO or DJ PC as a terrorist organization they got
[49:16.240 --> 49:20.280]  everyone's names and see it's the same thing it's the same thing they do over
[49:20.280 --> 49:23.680]  and over again where they hired the finishes admitted folks about 50 thugs
[49:23.680 --> 49:28.000]  to attack Nike town and attack cops and the cops ordered to stand down and then
[49:28.000 --> 49:31.080]  they go get housed in a government building in Seattle and then it came out
[49:31.080 --> 49:34.880]  that quote Delta force was running it that would that's in my film police state
[49:34.880 --> 49:40.080]  to the takeover this is serious business and the police are running this
[49:40.080 --> 49:45.000]  absolutely and they're they're days of resistance demonstrations include a
[49:45.000 --> 49:49.040]  massive anti-war march in which they're telling people to lock arms and approach
[49:49.040 --> 49:54.480]  the Pepsi Center approach the peace the police line and I said well you can't
[49:54.480 --> 49:57.120]  get in you're not gonna be able to get in and they said well we're going we have
[49:57.120 --> 50:00.360]  citizens we have a right to get in as well obviously they're gonna be talking
[50:00.360 --> 50:04.320]  about a direct physical confrontation on that march they've one called shake your
[50:04.320 --> 50:07.560]  money maker where they're gonna be surrounding the Denver Mint and
[50:07.560 --> 50:10.960]  literally shaking the fences which we talked to the Denver Mint they said if
[50:10.960 --> 50:15.360]  anyone attempts to jump over the fence or even if you actually banalize that
[50:15.360 --> 50:19.560]  fence around the Denver coin mint they can shoot you so let's expand on that
[50:19.560 --> 50:23.720]  then they get to show these images which they know there's gonna be protest and
[50:23.720 --> 50:29.840]  flash mobs and resistance their own Pentagon and Department of Defense out

[50:33.640 --> 50:37.320]  images of it always being violent and dangerous so the mainstream doesn't get
[50:37.320 --> 50:41.800]  involved massive government sigh up they gave them the lottery the government

[54:09.680 --> 54:16.000]  into this world we're thrown the federal government has admitted major papers
[54:16.000 --> 54:20.840]  have admitted that the Pentagon spies on even the smallest peace groups that's
[54:20.840 --> 54:24.840]  right u.s. military what you pay for against the American people there's a
[54:24.840 --> 54:29.720]  killer on the road totally illegal it's been a meditancy legal and the
[54:29.720 --> 54:34.240]  government just says we are criminals shut up we'll do what we want when we
[54:34.240 --> 54:39.640]  want how we want and they know that as they take your pension funds as a
[54:39.640 --> 54:44.400]  start new wars as their rest people as they put people in FEMA camps you're
[54:44.400 --> 54:48.560]  gonna try to protest and that's why they got microwave guns and sound cannons
[54:48.560 --> 54:53.360]  and riot police ready and ready to drive the buses and the relocation centers
[54:53.360 --> 54:58.200]  built at every major airport like we have here in Austin not just at Berkstrom
[54:58.200 --> 55:01.680]  but at the old Robert Mueller they got a facility out there to chain you to the
[55:01.680 --> 55:05.080]  floor we've got that in my film police state to the takeover and now it's all
[55:05.080 --> 55:08.280]  admitted it's kind of I'm kind of past saying now and what I talked about a
[55:08.280 --> 55:14.040]  decade plus ago is no mainstream news but they have to it's hard for them to
[55:14.040 --> 55:19.720]  attack peaceful groups you know Gandhi proved that but then the British did try
[55:19.720 --> 55:23.160]  this some of the Gandhi but folks saw through that too so they have people
[55:23.160 --> 55:26.400]  dressed up in the crowd who will do violent things or sometimes if they
[55:26.400 --> 55:31.080]  can't do that if it's not a hired a foundation group like these organizations
[55:31.080 --> 55:34.800]  are they will just have cops attack cops and they've been caught all over doing
[55:34.800 --> 55:37.880]  that in Europe they've been caught they've been caught in Canada this last
[55:37.880 --> 55:41.960]  year and that was in major papers that they did stage attacks on themselves to
[55:41.960 --> 55:46.600]  then attack peaceful people it's a very criminal it is a form of false flag
[55:46.600 --> 55:51.960]  terrorism and then they designate the peaceful people as terrorists after they
[55:51.960 --> 55:57.440]  engage in the terrorism and but it's it's for the couch potatoes at home going
[55:57.440 --> 56:01.520]  look at those bad protesters you know throwing mall off cocktails basically
[56:01.520 --> 56:08.080]  and that's the image they then sell now only higher echelons the police are
[56:08.080 --> 56:13.920]  even aware of this but that's the image they need it's now been admitted we
[56:13.920 --> 56:18.640]  wrote articles and posted stories of photos where it showed flatback trucks
[56:18.640 --> 56:26.960]  with hundreds of Chinese police being handed the robes of the Tibetans and
[56:26.960 --> 56:30.880]  then it shows the very police and in the robes with machetes running around in
[56:30.880 --> 56:38.640]  front of cameras waving giant swords and attacking buildings and burning them and
[56:38.640 --> 56:45.200]  then that way they get to have a mass arrest of Tibetans so this is the same
[56:45.200 --> 56:48.720]  thing and they do it here and until you realize that it's only going to get
[56:48.720 --> 56:52.720]  worse Jonathan the Ellen off I want to briefly get into the Gary Hart situation
[56:52.720 --> 56:56.800]  to but finish up your points about when the Democratic Committee is going to be
[56:56.800 --> 57:00.800]  there when the convention is where it's located and we need people to be
[57:00.800 --> 57:05.400]  there videotaping this and documenting the activities you need to be videotaping
[57:05.400 --> 57:09.200]  the leaders need to have teams simultaneously with video cameras on
[57:09.200 --> 57:14.440]  them and the police for signals that's how we caught them up in Canada last
[57:14.440 --> 57:19.480]  year was off the signals and then their boots but any anything else on that yeah
[57:19.480 --> 57:24.800]  we there's a memo that went out along peace police and hospitals here locally
[57:24.800 --> 57:29.200]  in Denver advising people of terrorism and anarchist groups they name recreate

[1:00:55.520 --> 1:01:00.120]  truth lines and we are changing sites soon we're still editing it and basically
[1:01:00.120 --> 1:01:04.400]  they admitted to us first of all I said he's familiar with Gandhi and the
[1:01:04.400 --> 1:01:07.440]  success of Martin Luther King being peaceful and that's when the founder of
[1:01:07.440 --> 1:01:11.160]  Ram D said and these are the guys by the way running recreate 68 just heads up on
[1:01:11.160 --> 1:01:14.920]  that he said to me goes well look violence is the only thing these f
[1:01:14.920 --> 1:01:19.960]  and cops understand and I looked at him and I was like are you kidding me so
[1:01:19.960 --> 1:01:23.600]  that was what kicked off the whole debate we didn't start to talk about
[1:01:23.600 --> 1:01:27.280]  violence not being effective he handed me a DVD that he made called
[1:01:27.280 --> 1:01:32.720]  troublemaker that he's been handing out at the recreate 68 meetings this DVD is
[1:01:32.720 --> 1:01:36.960]  put out by this Ram D group it's revolutionary anti-imperialist movement
[1:01:36.960 --> 1:01:40.800]  Denver's what it stands for it's all up on that truth lines that that article
[1:01:40.800 --> 1:01:45.920]  it's all verified they even admit all this and they're telling people to
[1:01:45.920 --> 1:01:52.120]  bring bags of blood and urine and throw it on the cops no joke this is again you
[1:01:52.120 --> 1:01:58.120]  can get attempted murder for that and they know that some weak-minded person
[1:01:58.120 --> 1:02:01.960]  will do it that's all they'll burn and then these guys that are doing this

[1:09:52.200 --> 1:10:00.000]  about the provocateur operations very upsetting what you're telling me and I'm
[1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:03.440]  looking it up right now you have the memos going out of the hospitals the
[1:10:03.440 --> 1:10:08.200]  police everybody the terrorists are gonna hit there's gonna be riots and 30 40
[1:10:08.200 --> 1:10:14.240]  thousand people injured or killed and that there's anarchist groups doing it
[1:10:14.240 --> 1:10:17.520]  I mean if that was the case and these anarchist groups are always calling for
[1:10:17.520 --> 1:10:21.640]  criminal things why aren't they being arrested now I want to be clear they're
[1:10:21.640 --> 1:10:25.720]  real anarchist groups like addressing black and or for no government and you
[1:10:25.720 --> 1:10:29.880]  know some groups that are wearing three-piece suits but the black block is
[1:10:29.880 --> 1:10:35.040]  it's known or the main line anarchist I've seen them starting fights in Austin
[1:10:35.040 --> 1:10:39.160]  at the fortune 500 and I saw him get orders from cops and I had one walk up
[1:10:39.160 --> 1:10:42.360]  and say we're gonna kill you someday yeah we work for the government that's
[1:10:42.360 --> 1:10:46.280]  why we really talk to them they'll go communism man mousy tongue but then
[1:10:46.280 --> 1:10:50.480]  they'll act like they're anarchist because a the globalists don't want you
[1:10:50.480 --> 1:10:53.360]  to know that they're still a huge communist influence that our government
[1:10:53.360 --> 1:10:57.280]  controls so for the public oh it's anarchist that's why they're wearing red
[1:10:57.280 --> 1:11:04.320]  stars but that's another cover itself they're just government operatives and
[1:11:04.320 --> 1:11:09.600]  they're lazy scum they go to like 10 15 events a year max they start fights
[1:11:09.600 --> 1:11:14.120]  staged stuff with police and then they get 50 grand a year they're very well
[1:11:14.120 --> 1:11:18.480]  taken care of and you know they leave the events and get their sports cars and
[1:11:18.480 --> 1:11:23.600]  drive back to their apartments and it's a wonderful way to destroy freedom they
[1:11:23.600 --> 1:11:27.760]  were caught in Genoa remember in Italy when the police ran over people with
[1:11:27.760 --> 1:11:31.400]  tanks and tanks they were caught there staging stuff and then starting the
[1:11:31.400 --> 1:11:35.320]  violence of the cops could attack I'm going back to Jonathan they're really
[1:11:35.320 --> 1:11:39.640]  worried about Democrats showing up and pointing out that the parties pro-war so
[1:11:39.640 --> 1:11:43.720]  I guess they mean to discredit everybody with a black op John absolutely
[1:11:43.720 --> 1:11:49.080]  they're gonna drown we've been trying to get you know 9-11 public the anti-war
[1:11:49.080 --> 1:11:54.000]  movement going they've hurt all of our efforts here in in Denver trying to get
[1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:58.680]  this big Denver started passing all kinds of laws that are all on unconstitutional
[1:11:58.680 --> 1:12:03.360]  like a curfew at 10 30 p.m. but they're gonna enforce of course recreate 68 is
[1:12:03.360 --> 1:12:07.360]  intentionally making a statement saying now is that a curfew for adults as well
[1:12:07.360 --> 1:12:13.920]  for the street a street curfew 10 30 p.m. from it's the week of the 20th that
[1:12:13.920 --> 1:12:18.200]  came out they're also well that is martial law and I may fly to Denver now
[1:12:18.200 --> 1:12:23.320]  and get arrested and ensue them because I mean this is so evil and of course it's
[1:12:23.320 --> 1:12:27.160]  all selectively enforced you know a lot of US cities have curfews for adults
[1:12:27.160 --> 1:12:32.400]  now I mean the folks that's martial law that is martial law but please tell me
[1:12:32.400 --> 1:12:37.120]  more the security zone and the free speech owner to be mount announced in
[1:12:37.120 --> 1:12:41.320]  mid-June and the purpose of that was because it only gives a couple of months
[1:12:41.320 --> 1:12:45.600]  for people to make cases against it legally which isn't if anyone knows the
[1:12:45.600 --> 1:12:49.160]  court system that's not enough time they pushed announcing their security zone
[1:12:49.160 --> 1:12:52.320]  and free speech zone all the way to mid-June now they're saying it might be
[1:12:52.320 --> 1:12:56.920]  the end of June and by the way this security zone is a 12-foot fence that
[1:12:56.920 --> 1:12:59.920]  they're building around the Pepsi Center and the Denver Convention Center and
[1:12:59.920 --> 1:13:06.440]  nobody can approach the convention unless you're busted gates open you enter
[1:13:06.440 --> 1:13:10.800]  into a giant camp now and they've also done drills at that convention center
[1:13:10.800 --> 1:13:14.600]  to put people in it as a camp so I assure you this fence around it because I
[1:13:14.600 --> 1:13:19.080]  saw the plan in 2001 is actually a FEMA takeover drill so they'll actually be
[1:13:19.080 --> 1:13:23.200]  practicing the movement of people and processing with people going to the DNC
[1:13:23.200 --> 1:13:27.720]  never even knowing they're part of a larger drill now look into that you'll
[1:13:27.720 --> 1:13:34.520]  actually find that's the truth Jonathan sure expanding out on that man I they
[1:13:34.520 --> 1:13:38.480]  are just so over the top to destroy freedom in this country aren't they
[1:13:38.480 --> 1:13:43.880]  absolutely this is all just a big sabotage to drown out any effort to get
[1:13:43.880 --> 1:13:48.280]  the real issues known all of them groups that I know including our group have
[1:13:48.280 --> 1:13:52.480]  been fighting very hard to get our message heard and this is going to do a
[1:13:52.480 --> 1:13:57.200]  complete 180 on everything we've done so we're distancing ourselves from recreate
[1:13:57.200 --> 1:14:02.040]  68 as much as possible we're exposing Reem D as well they should be arrested
[1:14:02.040 --> 1:14:06.400]  for and I mean what they're talking about is direct violations of law this is
[1:14:06.400 --> 1:14:10.920]  they won't be they won't be they won't be they're gonna get a promotions and
[1:14:10.920 --> 1:14:15.240]  probably a sergeant stripe yeah this is just horrible and so this whole thing is
[1:14:15.240 --> 1:14:19.400]  just it's just stinking really bad well I mean here's the government openly
[1:14:19.400 --> 1:14:23.920]  trying to violate your rights and and trying to you know announce the free
[1:14:23.920 --> 1:14:26.720]  speech zone late so you can't sue them because it's all getting thrown out of
[1:14:26.720 --> 1:14:32.840]  court the government is criminal ladies and gentlemen go ahead so I put a ton
[1:14:32.840 --> 1:14:37.280]  of stuff in that article on truth or I feel free to link to it on in fours or
[1:14:37.280 --> 1:14:40.920]  put it up there I want to get this information out to everyone so they can
[1:14:40.920 --> 1:14:45.160]  prepare themselves and educate themselves and basically equip themselves with
[1:14:45.160 --> 1:14:48.280]  the knowledge that if they're coming to Denver they need to know about what's
[1:14:48.280 --> 1:14:51.160]  been happening because they're not talking about it on the mainstream
[1:14:51.160 --> 1:14:55.760]  corporate news it's all over our papers it's all of our our local news but
[1:14:55.760 --> 1:14:57.760]  nobody else knows but I still know people that don't even know the
[1:14:57.760 --> 1:15:00.840]  convention is going to be here and we've been going through a massive
[1:15:00.840 --> 1:15:04.640]  transition fighting all these unconstitutional laws trying to get
[1:15:04.640 --> 1:15:09.400]  press and it's just been just been a roller coaster ride to be honest with
[1:15:09.400 --> 1:15:15.360]  you well you need to you know if these were real protests they tell 100,000
[1:15:15.360 --> 1:15:19.240]  people to show up and then be in big phone bank centers all making calls
[1:15:19.240 --> 1:15:22.840]  every talk show in the country that would be hundreds of millions hearing it
[1:15:22.840 --> 1:15:26.880]  they would have people there you know doing live streaming on the web they
[1:15:26.880 --> 1:15:31.480]  would have people protesting different areas they would have people leafleting
[1:15:31.480 --> 1:15:35.160]  imagine in 100,000 people in Denver to each head out a hundred leaflets every
[1:15:35.160 --> 1:15:39.240]  person would get a leaflet you know a couple times I mean that's the type of
[1:15:39.240 --> 1:15:44.000]  but no none of the whole peace movement is run by the Ford Foundation run by the
[1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:47.880]  Defense Department and for those that want to research that that's a fact
[1:15:47.880 --> 1:15:51.640]  they created the peace movement so they could control it knowing a peace
[1:15:51.640 --> 1:15:58.040]  movement would develop they didn't catalyze it as an anti-gun movement all
[1:15:58.040 --> 1:16:01.960]  I can say is great job Jonathan and the reportage that's out there let's shift
[1:16:01.960 --> 1:16:05.160]  gears now and we'll watch this as it develops let's shift gears in the Gary
[1:16:05.160 --> 1:16:09.560]  Hart sure thing we confirmed it with the tattered cover bookstore a couple weeks
[1:16:09.560 --> 1:16:15.560]  ago I was able to co-op control of the mic and I basically presented myself as
[1:16:15.560 --> 1:16:19.680]  triple line network showed him a press pass that oh yeah well can we film we
[1:16:19.680 --> 1:16:24.360]  got permission to film and because I controlled the mic I was able to
[1:16:24.360 --> 1:16:27.280]  control who gets asked the question obviously I went around the room picked
[1:16:27.280 --> 1:16:31.600]  all we are a couple other people mainly we are changers so he was barraged for
[1:16:31.600 --> 1:16:35.560]  25 minutes with questions from we are changed and he just he just took a
[1:16:35.560 --> 1:16:39.480]  beating we thought it was over he decided to do another book announcement up in
[1:16:39.480 --> 1:16:43.800]  boulder we're changed Colorado attended that with beef log and boulder 9-11
[1:16:43.800 --> 1:16:48.720]  visibility and basically it was a repeat only we we got him even better this
[1:16:48.720 --> 1:16:52.200]  time we asked him about his new world order statement which he did make
[1:16:52.200 --> 1:16:57.400]  September 13th he made that statement he said he was well I have it on video and
[1:16:57.400 --> 1:17:02.000]  two of my films exactly and nobody can deny that he I mean he can't deny it
[1:17:02.000 --> 1:17:06.400]  sure certainly when asked about it what does he do he says I never said that you
[1:17:06.400 --> 1:17:09.720]  got your information wrong then he comes and then they say well we've seen it it's
[1:17:09.720 --> 1:17:13.800]  on YouTube he just no no no you're I'm not gonna have a repeat of what we had at
[1:17:13.800 --> 1:17:18.440]  the Tata cover last week and everyone was like are you serious come on Gary
[1:17:18.440 --> 1:17:23.440]  come on you said it we all know what you said then he goes then he goes out and
[1:17:23.440 --> 1:17:27.880]  says it's three minutes into the video on Truth Alliance by the way is where
[1:17:27.880 --> 1:17:32.840]  that clip is then he goes on to say well what we do need is a new international
[1:17:32.840 --> 1:17:36.760]  order he says I've never said the new the term new world order but we need a new
[1:17:36.760 --> 1:17:41.440]  international order okay let's go ahead and play him denying and then play the
[1:17:41.440 --> 1:17:46.600]  clip of him saying it go ahead you're out of famous with said
[1:17:47.600 --> 1:17:54.600]  that we can use this disaster to bring about the new world order I did not I've
[1:17:54.600 --> 1:17:58.200]  never used that phrase in my life so you've got some bad information really
[1:17:58.200 --> 1:18:02.880]  I've seen you I heard it I heard it on YouTube video after video saying I saw it
[1:18:02.880 --> 1:18:09.560]  on YouTube to Gary Hart your own coming out of your own mouth no okay George I'm
[1:18:09.560 --> 1:18:15.480]  not going to repeat what we have at the bookstore I mean at the editor book store
[1:18:15.480 --> 1:18:22.480]  you can film this if you wish it's up to you doesn't matter but George HW Bush
[1:18:22.480 --> 1:18:28.440]  used the phrase new world order once and he never used it again she's I saw him
[1:18:28.440 --> 1:18:34.400]  use that like eight times on YouTube I'm not here to check it out you asked me
[1:18:34.400 --> 1:18:38.040]  a question I'm giving you an answer side question change the topic mean my
[1:18:38.040 --> 1:18:48.120]  opinion okay some search okay other places okay now later in the clip that
[1:18:48.120 --> 1:18:52.400]  didn't you insert the clip of him saying it yes we asserted it right afterwards
[1:18:52.400 --> 1:18:55.520]  where we show all the times George Bush said the new world order phrase I'll
[1:18:55.520 --> 1:18:59.120]  tell you we're going to cue it up to that and come back and play it all on the
[1:18:59.120 --> 1:19:05.200]  other side George Bush said new world order in public more than 200 plus times
[1:19:05.200 --> 1:19:09.880]  that was websites that have chronicled all of them more than 30 times on video
[1:19:09.880 --> 1:19:15.680]  Bill Clinton said it Gordon Brown said it Hitler called for it and then here's
[1:19:15.680 --> 1:19:24.320]  Hart saying he never said the term new world order just brazen liar mm-hmm he
[1:19:24.320 --> 1:19:27.560]  also says we're gonna get attacked again when asked about that he says I've
[1:19:27.560 --> 1:19:32.000]  been saying this for seven years consistently he says he's adamant he
[1:19:32.000 --> 1:19:35.840]  knows we're gonna get attacked again he says when asked about the FEMA camp he
[1:19:35.840 --> 1:19:38.600]  says they don't exist we said what are you talking about there's a what are

[1:21:07.080 --> 1:21:10.440]  Fired was born out of sheer frustration with abuses in our current political
[1:21:10.440 --> 1:21:13.880]  system and it gives a voice to Americans across the country. Washington You're
[1:21:13.880 --> 1:21:17.920]  Fired examines constitutional issues as they relate to the Katrina disaster, the
[1:21:17.920 --> 1:21:22.600]  president's illegal spy program, NSA data mining, FISA's secret court, the illegal
[1:21:22.600 --> 1:21:26.080]  wiretapping of millions of Americans and the last seven years of terror related
[1:21:26.080 --> 1:21:29.940]  spy bills, how they affect you and what you can do about it. Washington You're
[1:21:29.940 --> 1:21:33.520]  Fired captures the spirit and zest of an old-fashioned Boston Tea Party.
[1:21:33.520 --> 1:21:37.920]  Cam Williams describes the film as a rabble-rousing call to arms. We invite

[1:22:51.440 --> 1:22:55.360]  Uncivil liberties takes place in the future, right? Like Star Wars? Yeah, that's
[1:22:55.360 --> 1:22:59.960]  right. Slightly in the future. Wait a second. I thought Star Wars took place a
[1:22:59.960 --> 1:23:04.360]  long long time ago. All right, Einstein, but it is kind of like Star Wars anyway.
[1:23:04.360 --> 1:23:08.720]  Just like Star Wars, there's an evil empire and some people have started an
[1:23:08.720 --> 1:23:13.680]  armed rebellion to fight the evil empire. Okay, so don't tell me. The government's
[1:23:13.680 --> 1:23:18.320]  the bad guys again? Yeah, that's right. Oh, so your character's like Luke Skywalker?
[1:23:18.320 --> 1:23:24.240]  Not exactly. I know, you're Chewbacca! Not really, but my character does help the
[1:23:24.240 --> 1:23:28.160]  rebellion to stop the government's evil tracking system, which is happening now
[1:23:28.160 --> 1:23:32.720]  in the real world, just like in Uncivil Liberties. Wait a second, they can't track us.
[1:23:32.720 --> 1:23:38.880]  It's a free country. Exactly. Uncivil Liberties. Go to UncivilLiberties.com or

[1:23:52.040 --> 1:23:56.800]  President of the United States to use this disaster to carry out what his
[1:23:56.800 --> 1:24:02.000]  father, a phrase his father used, I think only once and hasn't been used since, and
[1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:08.080]  that is a new world order. What I have said to you tonight is we do need a new
[1:24:08.080 --> 1:24:13.880]  international order unless we want to lose tens of millions of people. Oh, we're
[1:24:13.880 --> 1:24:17.600]  gonna lose tens of millions of people unless you give total control to us,
[1:24:17.600 --> 1:24:24.120]  unless you let us totally rule your life. Jonathan Elanoff, great job. If you guys
[1:24:24.120 --> 1:24:27.520]  can send us just the clip of Gary Hart, I know you've already given us a lot of
[1:24:27.520 --> 1:24:30.320]  footage for the new film. It's gonna come out in the next two, three months,
[1:24:30.320 --> 1:24:35.000]  about 9-11 truth. We are changed the whole movement. If you can send me that
[1:24:35.000 --> 1:24:40.880]  new Hart clip, I have the footage of Gary off C-Span at the Hart-Revin
[1:24:40.880 --> 1:24:44.360]  Commission calling for a one-world government saying use this disaster for
[1:24:44.360 --> 1:24:48.560]  a new world order and we'll put that in the film. I think that's very, very
[1:24:48.560 --> 1:24:53.120]  important to show their level of bold. Absolutely. We'll send it out right away.
[1:24:53.120 --> 1:24:58.000]  Well, you're the best. Give us the We Are Change website. The We Are Change
[1:24:58.000 --> 1:25:04.960]  Colorado dot O-R-G is our chapter. It's our activist front and the Truth
[1:25:04.960 --> 1:25:10.120]  Alliance dot net is our basically our journalist front and we're all members
[1:25:10.120 --> 1:25:14.240]  on both. We basically write on one and we show all our video clips on the other.
[1:25:14.240 --> 1:25:18.720]  Well, I have to say We Are Change Colorado is very professional, just really
[1:25:18.720 --> 1:25:22.760]  nice, really intelligent people. I know you guys and gals have invited me out and
[1:25:22.760 --> 1:25:25.800]  I've been really flattered. I've just been so tied down here with work and
[1:25:25.800 --> 1:25:31.040]  family and taxes and films that I can hardly get a minute to comb my hair
[1:25:31.040 --> 1:25:35.560]  much less come out there. But I might come out there for this DNC thing
[1:25:35.560 --> 1:25:41.360]  just because it's so evil and I need to be on the ground to document the police
[1:25:41.360 --> 1:25:45.240]  provocaturing because the MO you've told me in the documents I've got here
[1:25:45.240 --> 1:25:50.160]  there's no doubt this is a serious operation and just by us being there
[1:25:50.160 --> 1:25:54.560]  they may not do it. Right and this massive organization I'm surprised Glenn was
[1:25:54.560 --> 1:26:00.720]  basically able to pop up out of nowhere joined in with this old leftover group
[1:26:00.720 --> 1:26:04.680]  from the Denver Action Network which has a bad you know provocateur past and
[1:26:04.680 --> 1:26:08.720]  basically they pop up out of nowhere they get thousands of dollars from
[1:26:08.720 --> 1:26:14.280]  around the country they fly around start promoting it and just all this
[1:26:14.280 --> 1:26:17.640]  momentum they've got porta-potties ordered for the Civic Center Park
[1:26:17.640 --> 1:26:21.160]  they're gonna be housing and feeding the homeless they're gonna be they got
[1:26:21.160 --> 1:26:25.160]  they claim to be busing in 10,000 people they don't have anywhere to put them so
[1:26:25.160 --> 1:26:28.640]  they're setting up a tent city at the Civic Center Park. Yeah let's be clear
[1:26:28.640 --> 1:26:32.280]  the group that's calling for that has groups with them and calling for
[1:26:32.280 --> 1:26:36.360]  throwing bags of blood on police they're the ones being given everything by the
[1:26:36.360 --> 1:26:40.520]  system and then and then there was a lottery to see who'd get it and they
[1:26:40.520 --> 1:26:45.400]  magically got it and but also the Democratic Party got one. Exactly
[1:26:45.400 --> 1:26:50.720]  Jenny Anderson the event director for the DNC hosting committee was granted
[1:26:50.720 --> 1:26:55.000]  the first day of demonstration she was granted the entire Civic Center Park
[1:26:55.000 --> 1:27:01.000]  which is just a coincidence I guess and it's just a joke I mean the whole thing
[1:27:01.000 --> 1:27:04.200]  just stinks that she gets that you know and it's supposed to be a
[1:27:04.200 --> 1:27:09.600]  transparent you know blind lottery that's there was over 800 people that
[1:27:09.600 --> 1:27:15.000]  that applied for that to get that park and the own the DNC hosting committee
[1:27:15.000 --> 1:27:19.000]  gets it but they've already paid thousands and thousands of dollars to
[1:27:19.000 --> 1:27:22.400]  rent out the Six Flags Elish Gardens which is right next door to Elish
[1:27:22.400 --> 1:27:26.200]  Gardens downtown Denver for their big kickoff party so what do they need the
[1:27:26.200 --> 1:27:30.760]  Civic Center Park for which by the way is public property you can't the whole
[1:27:30.760 --> 1:27:35.680]  thing doesn't make any sense it doesn't make any sense at all not not to be in
[1:27:35.680 --> 1:27:40.200]  nowhere up and down so Jonathan I appreciate you and we are changed
[1:27:40.200 --> 1:27:47.120]  Colorado's work please fire off that Gary Hart video with him denying he ever
[1:27:47.120 --> 1:27:50.800]  said it and saying it's not true because I'm definitely going to put that in the
[1:27:50.800 --> 1:27:55.480]  new film which I can tell you the name of it ladies and gentlemen it is 9-11
[1:27:55.480 --> 1:28:00.720]  Chronicles and then we're gonna call it Truth Revolution or Truth Rising part
[1:28:00.720 --> 1:28:05.720]  one 9-11 Chronicles part one Truth Rising or Truth Revolution I'm not sure
[1:28:05.720 --> 1:28:09.360]  yet but we're right down to the wire on that and we're pretty much at picture
[1:28:09.360 --> 1:28:12.360]  lock where we're adding in the lower thirds and things but that is so
[1:28:12.360 --> 1:28:15.960]  important we're also going to be adding the new thing that Luke got a few days
[1:28:15.960 --> 1:28:21.720]  ago with and I appreciate it finally being truthful the lady from
[1:28:21.720 --> 1:28:26.880]  democracy now finally coming out and saying building seven should be
[1:28:26.880 --> 1:28:31.240]  investigated that is suspicious so Amy Goodman I mean the cover-up is really
[1:28:31.240 --> 1:28:36.080]  starting to implode that's excellent work that's being done in the we are
[1:28:36.080 --> 1:28:39.000]  change movement no question about it well John and we got a few months before
[1:28:39.000 --> 1:28:43.440]  the DNC so we'll have you on way before then and keep up the good work yes sir

[1:33:51.480 --> 1:33:55.880]  yeah Gary Hart says he never called for a new world order either it's just not
[1:33:55.880 --> 1:33:58.280]  true
[1:34:00.360 --> 1:34:04.280]  everything must go
[1:34:04.840 --> 1:34:11.400]  that was the cover of the aust american statesman life in arts section
[1:34:11.400 --> 1:34:19.320]  back on march 30th 2008 I guess that was 17 days ago and I got a few phone calls
[1:34:19.320 --> 1:34:25.080]  about this my friend Steve Mason called freaking out saying do you know who
[1:34:25.080 --> 1:34:30.520]  University of Texas senior fellow Philip Bombett is
[1:34:30.680 --> 1:34:35.880]  and I said uh yeah I know who he is we've gone and covered him he's
[1:34:35.880 --> 1:34:38.760]  he's a high level strategist for the new world order
[1:34:38.760 --> 1:34:43.480]  I read his book the shield of Achilles
[1:34:43.560 --> 1:34:48.120]  which we covered here in shot video some of the meetings he had a few years ago
[1:34:48.120 --> 1:34:51.560]  and he said well you got to read this well I didn't read it I
[1:34:51.560 --> 1:34:56.520]  there was a few days after I didn't have the paper he showed up
[1:34:56.520 --> 1:35:00.600]  Monday night at the tv studio and brought me a copy and I appreciate him
[1:35:00.600 --> 1:35:04.600]  doing that I mean I need to be reminded of things I can't keep track of one
[1:35:04.600 --> 1:35:08.120]  tenth of what's happening there's so much evil so many admissions so many
[1:35:08.120 --> 1:35:13.400]  things going on and there are tens of thousands of
[1:35:13.400 --> 1:35:18.760]  magazine articles books uh periodicals that have been written in the last
[1:35:18.760 --> 1:35:24.520]  decade tens of thousands in the last hundred years
[1:35:24.520 --> 1:35:27.400]  where they say they're going to get rid of the bill of rights and constitution
[1:35:27.400 --> 1:35:30.200]  where they say they're going to hand all power over to select
[1:35:30.200 --> 1:35:33.720]  corporations and a global government
[1:35:33.720 --> 1:35:39.960]  but rarely do they do it in the newspaper
[1:35:39.960 --> 1:35:43.640]  it's in periodicals it's in scholarly works it's in
[1:35:43.640 --> 1:35:49.800]  it's in textbooks uh it's in quarterly reports it's in governmental reports
[1:35:49.800 --> 1:35:55.000]  it's in think tank reports this was the front page of a section of the
[1:35:55.000 --> 1:35:58.280]  statesman and I showed it yesterday on the fourth hour where we
[1:35:58.280 --> 1:36:01.880]  turned this into a tv program radio simulcast
[1:36:01.880 --> 1:36:06.360]  for prison planet dot tv members I showed it but but now we've scanned it in
[1:36:06.360 --> 1:36:10.280]  and put it up in stories that paul watson wrote and the curtain demo have
[1:36:10.280 --> 1:36:15.000]  written as well he's he's done something on it neocons call for shredding
[1:36:15.000 --> 1:36:19.160]  constitution imposing world government
[1:36:21.560 --> 1:36:27.720]  and you can go up to prison planet dot com and look at it
[1:36:27.720 --> 1:36:34.600]  we've got a scan in there if you go to jones report dot com uh
[1:36:34.600 --> 1:36:38.280]  erin's actually got a big scan of it this is a little scan i want you to be
[1:36:38.280 --> 1:36:42.040]  able to read the fine print on it of the actual news story not just paul's
[1:36:42.040 --> 1:36:45.800]  story about it in fact let's tell paul to
[1:36:45.800 --> 1:36:49.480]  put a link to the high res one in there if we can
[1:36:49.480 --> 1:36:53.000]  everything must go and on the front of it it's
[1:36:53.000 --> 1:36:58.040]  got a copy of the declaration of independence we the people
[1:36:58.040 --> 1:37:02.520]  and the constitution has been ripped in half and it's got burned a burned edge
[1:37:02.520 --> 1:37:06.920]  and because it's been gotten out of the way because it has been
[1:37:06.920 --> 1:37:12.600]  removed you see how to fight terrorism
[1:37:14.440 --> 1:37:20.760]  and then it goes on to say you know a program to keep americans safe
[1:37:20.760 --> 1:37:26.360]  like gary hart said he said you either let us have a world government
[1:37:26.360 --> 1:37:31.480]  or tens of millions are going to die and that's really a true statement
[1:37:31.480 --> 1:37:35.000]  they're going to kill tens of millions to get it and then they're going to kill
[1:37:35.000 --> 1:37:39.560]  billions after they get it so uh when they i mean they're these are men who
[1:37:39.560 --> 1:37:44.120]  are all about having power they're all about really having real power
[1:37:44.120 --> 1:37:47.080]  and they're about they're about doing the things that it takes to get it and
[1:37:47.080 --> 1:37:52.440]  maintain it and they're a different elk they see us as weak
[1:37:52.440 --> 1:37:55.720]  you know i talk about some child dying of a brain tumor
[1:37:55.720 --> 1:37:59.160]  and i don't even know the child but it makes me sad and upset to them that
[1:37:59.160 --> 1:38:03.400]  means absolutely none these are cold-blooded individuals
[1:38:03.400 --> 1:38:07.080]  and everything is about how to manipulate you and you read this article
[1:38:07.080 --> 1:38:10.280]  where they say everything must go get rid of the constitution bill of right
[1:38:10.280 --> 1:38:14.760]  sovereignty it's a bunch of nonsensical
[1:38:14.760 --> 1:38:19.000]  hyperbole wrapped up in a intellectual bow
[1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:21.640]  and then everyone i've been to these meetings these guys are at they just
[1:38:21.640 --> 1:38:25.400]  fawn around them and you know just other professors
[1:38:25.400 --> 1:38:30.200]  fawning oh and you're such a genius and and they all affect eastern accents
[1:38:30.200 --> 1:38:34.840]  and go oh no
[1:38:34.840 --> 1:38:41.560]  and it's just there it's just sick these are sick sick people
[1:38:41.560 --> 1:38:45.560]  and so they're the good guys burn the constitution get rid of
[1:38:45.560 --> 1:38:49.240]  what this country stands for that's a good thing that is the
[1:38:49.240 --> 1:38:57.000]  image on the front and what they say in words on the cover of the story
[1:38:57.000 --> 1:39:02.680]  then you open up the story and you begin to read it
[1:39:02.680 --> 1:39:06.680]  amend the un chartered to allow the preemptive use of force
[1:39:06.680 --> 1:39:09.480]  without a security council authorization so
[1:39:09.480 --> 1:39:14.520]  allow the global governments play thing uh they're there they're they're debating
[1:39:14.520 --> 1:39:18.680]  circle the un runs nothing its security council runs it all
[1:39:18.680 --> 1:39:22.440]  to just say yeah we attack who we want first when we want
[1:39:22.440 --> 1:39:26.040]  so legalizing what's always been known as hit larian
[1:39:26.040 --> 1:39:30.920]  or stylistic now here's where it's really deceptive though i mean this is
[1:39:30.920 --> 1:39:35.480]  written very deceptively in a very twisted
[1:39:35.480 --> 1:39:40.200]  way you know you're dealing with an operative i mean he's definitely a
[1:39:40.200 --> 1:39:42.920]  fellow traveler for world government and elitism
[1:39:42.920 --> 1:39:47.640]  but the writer of this i want to get him on james e mcwilliams
[1:39:47.640 --> 1:39:51.080]  guarantee you get this guy on the phone he'll tell my producer no i don't wish
[1:39:51.080 --> 1:39:57.560]  to come over mr jones he's beneath me
[1:39:57.560 --> 1:40:02.760]  i'm just in love with myself no you guys aren't smart what you are as cancer
[1:40:02.760 --> 1:40:07.080]  you're willing to do things normal people aren't that's why you're in control
[1:40:07.080 --> 1:40:09.480]  period
[1:40:11.720 --> 1:40:15.640]  let me just get into it this is like taking a beating to read this because
[1:40:15.640 --> 1:40:19.320]  it makes me so mad this is where it starts getting
[1:40:19.320 --> 1:40:23.880]  really deceptive change the geneva conventions to
[1:40:23.880 --> 1:40:28.520]  forbid the indefinite confinement of terrorist prisoners
[1:40:28.520 --> 1:40:32.760]  without trial now the geneva convention says you
[1:40:32.760 --> 1:40:36.920]  can't hold somebody without charging them a week
[1:40:36.920 --> 1:40:40.040]  pabeus corpus basic magna carta basic english
[1:40:40.040 --> 1:40:43.320]  anglo-saxon common law
[1:40:44.280 --> 1:40:50.840]  same things in the mosaic law just ancient common law basic common sense
[1:40:50.840 --> 1:40:55.240]  before we had lawyers like this to twist everything for us
[1:40:55.240 --> 1:41:01.720]  now when you read it it says you they can't hold you a week without charges
[1:41:01.720 --> 1:41:04.680]  they must bring charges they must say what the crime is
[1:41:04.680 --> 1:41:09.080]  but this is written to where you think oh absolutely the un
[1:41:09.080 --> 1:41:13.240]  shouldn't be able to keep you forever you know they should only be able to
[1:41:13.240 --> 1:41:18.200]  hold you without trial for 20 years as bobbitt calls for in the book
[1:41:18.200 --> 1:41:21.400]  kind of like sloven melangevic was in there eight years and they poisoned
[1:41:21.400 --> 1:41:24.200]  him to death they admitted he was poisoned to death at the un building
[1:41:24.200 --> 1:41:27.560]  they just he was bringing up the fact that it was all staged in the u.s
[1:41:27.560 --> 1:41:31.800]  attack first and used al-qaeda to attack serbian and so they just killed him
[1:41:31.800 --> 1:41:34.760]  and he said they poisoned him and he said they poisoned me they made me take
[1:41:34.760 --> 1:41:37.960]  some pills and then he was so strong he didn't die and they went back in and
[1:41:37.960 --> 1:41:40.920]  poisoned him again he was dead later i mean
[1:41:40.920 --> 1:41:43.720]  you could even be saying they're murdering me so tough he could still
[1:41:43.720 --> 1:41:46.680]  fight through it didn't matter
[1:41:46.680 --> 1:41:48.680]  you
[1:41:53.480 --> 1:41:58.680]  poisoned him with a very exotic poison too that takes a lot of to kill you
[1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:07.560]  so change the geneva conventions to forbid oh it forbids the average yuppies
[1:42:07.560 --> 1:42:11.240]  at home thinking they know it all who would for bids and definite confinement
[1:42:11.240 --> 1:42:14.840]  of terrorist without trial
[1:42:14.840 --> 1:42:18.840]  you see that's meant for the average weak-minded person who thinks they're
[1:42:18.840 --> 1:42:21.640]  smarter to go oh well they it's forbidding and
[1:42:21.640 --> 1:42:24.680]  definite confinement
[1:42:25.240 --> 1:42:27.880]  but then when you know the geneva convention it says you can't have a
[1:42:27.880 --> 1:42:30.760]  definite confinement so see this is saying change it to where we can only
[1:42:30.760 --> 1:42:35.560]  hold you 20 years see that lawyer's strategic that
[1:42:35.560 --> 1:42:41.480]  mind game trick there oh and it gets fathom it is fathomless how bad it is
[1:42:41.480 --> 1:42:45.320]  allow a more invasive process of information gathering within
[1:42:45.320 --> 1:42:48.600]  and across national borders and he calls for total surveillance watching
[1:42:48.600 --> 1:42:52.520]  everyone know fourth amendment in the book so
[1:42:52.520 --> 1:42:56.360]  printable attack people for no reason whenever you want smiling everybody
[1:42:56.360 --> 1:42:59.720]  secretly arrest you and hold you because this son of a bitch isn't going to get
[1:42:59.720 --> 1:43:02.440]  away with what he's doing they're starting to lose they're not going to be able
[1:43:02.440 --> 1:43:04.600]  to have their way and take all our bank accounts and
[1:43:04.600 --> 1:43:07.880]  rule over us and have one in ten being a homeland security graduate
[1:43:07.880 --> 1:43:11.480]  from college and spies everywhere in east german nightmare
[1:43:11.480 --> 1:43:14.840]  with these pieces of filth at the top of it and their ivory towers on power
[1:43:14.840 --> 1:43:17.960]  trips unless they're able to come and arrest me
[1:43:17.960 --> 1:43:23.480]  and you bob it you know you're going to jail don't you
[1:43:23.480 --> 1:43:26.040]  we're going to take this country back a lot of us won't live to see it but you
[1:43:26.040 --> 1:43:29.400]  are going to spend time in prison boy
[1:43:29.400 --> 1:43:33.320]  when the use of non-lethal chemical weapons can be used to prevent terror
[1:43:33.320 --> 1:43:37.320]  prevent preemptive redefine such methods as counter force measures and
[1:43:37.320 --> 1:43:41.480]  then he goes in the book about basically knocking out populations
[1:43:41.480 --> 1:43:45.480]  gassing populations every major u.s city we learned this in what two thousand
[1:43:45.480 --> 1:43:49.000]  and two since the mid nineties has had helicopters
[1:43:49.000 --> 1:43:55.640]  inside facilities loaded with an opiate knockout gas canisters
[1:43:55.640 --> 1:43:59.400]  to spray and knock out whole u.s cities and they
[1:43:59.400 --> 1:44:02.440]  i predict that in a medium-sized city you'll have more than ten thousand deaths
[1:44:02.440 --> 1:44:05.880]  because you'll have car wrecks fires
[1:44:05.880 --> 1:44:08.920]  people falling and hitting their heads and it's knocked you out instantly
[1:44:08.920 --> 1:44:11.880]  and then they've got helicopters ready with knockout gas everywhere for you
[1:44:11.880 --> 1:44:14.680]  and your family kind of like cheney says legitimize the use of
[1:44:14.680 --> 1:44:17.400]  race specific bio weapons to kill certain races
[1:44:17.400 --> 1:44:20.440]  that's in public document
[1:44:20.760 --> 1:44:24.200]  september 2000 p.nacle building america's defenses
[1:44:24.200 --> 1:44:27.080]  there i even gave you the date of the document so you can't be lazy and say
[1:44:27.080 --> 1:44:30.520]  it doesn't exist these i mean when they're right
[1:44:30.520 --> 1:44:35.560]  memo saying torture children sexually and and telling them giving to the
[1:44:35.560 --> 1:44:42.840]  military nobody gets in trouble we're we're one minute to midnight here
[1:44:42.840 --> 1:44:46.600]  when they're putting the constitution being ripped apart saying it's good
[1:44:46.600 --> 1:44:50.840]  with an image of it and saying get rid of it on the front of the paper
[1:44:50.840 --> 1:44:54.600]  we're in deep trouble when they're saying hey we want to
[1:44:54.600 --> 1:44:59.000]  definitely arrest people whoever we want we're in trouble
[1:44:59.000 --> 1:45:01.880]  these guys let you know who they are because they think
[1:45:01.880 --> 1:45:05.720]  you say the behavioral psychologists know that the majority of people now
[1:45:05.720 --> 1:45:08.440]  have no moral compass they're just whatever they're told is normal they go
[1:45:08.440 --> 1:45:12.600]  with i mean if they told the the trendies that uh
[1:45:12.600 --> 1:45:16.120]  eating dead dog rotten roadkill was a delicacy and would make them look
[1:45:16.120 --> 1:45:18.760]  beautiful you'd have beautiful women lined up
[1:45:18.760 --> 1:45:22.520]  at shops paying hundreds of dollars per pound for rotten roadkill
[1:45:22.520 --> 1:45:28.200]  and i'm not being sarcastic they don't have compasses they don't have a
[1:45:28.200 --> 1:45:32.440]  a a heart a soul everything else orbits around
[1:45:32.440 --> 1:45:35.320]  they're different every day
[1:45:39.080 --> 1:45:42.440]  and so that's who they're programming and let me tell you
[1:45:42.440 --> 1:45:45.640]  people in austin open their newspapers up and they read this and most of them
[1:45:45.640 --> 1:45:49.880]  said well he's an esteemed person he's in a fancy suit
[1:45:49.880 --> 1:45:53.880]  uh he's a big top you know strategic planner
[1:45:53.880 --> 1:45:58.200]  must be true must you know we've got to go along with it now
[1:45:58.920 --> 1:46:02.600]  when the use of non-lethal chemical weapons can be used to prevent terror
[1:46:02.600 --> 1:46:06.520]  redefine such methods as counter force measures you know what i can't find it
[1:46:06.520 --> 1:46:10.840]  my stack erin will you dig out that washington post article
[1:46:10.840 --> 1:46:15.080]  about the government wants to wrap its mind around yours
[1:46:16.440 --> 1:46:19.160]  i just i looked for it some this morning i couldn't find it my stack then it
[1:46:19.160 --> 1:46:21.480]  was i was out of time to find it and i don't want to read off the computer
[1:46:21.480 --> 1:46:24.600]  screen i don't newsread well off the screen so just
[1:46:24.600 --> 1:46:28.360]  yeah just print off that uh washington post government wants to wrap its mind
[1:46:28.360 --> 1:46:30.520]  around yours i've been trying to cover it since sunday and
[1:46:30.520 --> 1:46:33.240]  i'm just gonna i was gonna have a guest on next hour and then but i'm just gonna
[1:46:33.240 --> 1:46:35.160]  go ahead and cover that next hour it's so important
[1:46:35.160 --> 1:46:38.440]  and we'll take some of your calls too
[1:46:41.880 --> 1:46:45.080]  all right let me go ahead and get into this now finish reading it the article
[1:46:45.080 --> 1:46:48.840]  begins with the average weak-minded person thinking oh
[1:46:48.840 --> 1:46:52.360]  this is going to not this is very liberal this will stop indefinite
[1:46:52.360 --> 1:46:57.640]  imprisonment when it actually allows it
[1:46:57.640 --> 1:47:01.000]  is that they can hold you for 20 they can hold you for 30 it doesn't matter
[1:47:01.000 --> 1:47:06.040]  ut senior fellow philip bombett argues that we will have to abandon our
[1:47:06.040 --> 1:47:11.080]  military and constitutional traditions if we want to survive this perilous
[1:47:11.080 --> 1:47:15.400]  century that's right abandon our constitutional it's
[1:47:15.400 --> 1:47:20.040]  not just traditions buddy like you traditionally go to the first ball
[1:47:20.040 --> 1:47:23.480]  game in your favorite baseball team
[1:47:24.440 --> 1:47:28.520]  you traditionally eat a hotdog with sauerkraut this isn't that this is our
[1:47:28.520 --> 1:47:31.880]  country this is why we're different this is why we became so successful
[1:47:31.880 --> 1:47:36.120]  because corrupt people in government couldn't suck off the general
[1:47:36.120 --> 1:47:40.680]  population in the middle class exploded and we had 15 growth rates for most of
[1:47:40.680 --> 1:47:44.680]  100 years till you people took over
[1:47:44.680 --> 1:47:47.400]  parasites
[1:47:48.520 --> 1:47:51.480]  so no we don't need to get rid of our traditions
[1:47:51.480 --> 1:47:57.080]  our laws that you flagrantly violate everywhere
[1:47:58.280 --> 1:48:01.640]  now treason is defined as treason against the constitution bill of rights
[1:48:01.640 --> 1:48:05.720]  by people in positions of power and this is a policymaker he writes the policies
[1:48:05.720 --> 1:48:10.680]  that are adopted this is treason the difference between free speech and
[1:48:10.680 --> 1:48:13.160]  treason
[1:48:13.160 --> 1:48:16.360]  when you argue against the fundamental bill of rights and constitution
[1:48:16.360 --> 1:48:20.360]  from a position of power and talk about depriving people of their rights you
[1:48:20.360 --> 1:48:23.880]  have become a tyrant
[1:48:28.920 --> 1:48:32.440]  see how every line is pure evil i've only gotten through like six lines
[1:48:32.440 --> 1:48:35.960]  mirror that again ut senior fellow philip bobbett argues
[1:48:35.960 --> 1:48:39.240]  that we'll have to abandon our military and constitutional traditions if we
[1:48:39.240 --> 1:48:43.000]  want to survive this perilous journey what did gary heart say threatening
[1:48:43.000 --> 1:48:45.960]  the students you better go along with the world
[1:48:45.960 --> 1:48:50.280]  government or tens of millions are going to die
[1:48:51.640 --> 1:48:57.400]  from al qaeda yes yes james e mcwilliams writes this
[1:48:57.400 --> 1:49:03.160]  funny simpering disgusting article talking about how smart
[1:49:03.160 --> 1:49:06.920]  fawning over bobbett's intelligence
[1:49:06.920 --> 1:49:11.560]  this isn't a this isn't an intelligent

[1:54:52.040 --> 1:54:56.360]  million abortions is good so what do you expect
[1:54:56.360 --> 1:55:00.360]  continuing here ut senior fellow philip bobbitt argues that we'll have to abandon
[1:55:00.360 --> 1:55:04.040]  our military and constitutional traditions if we want to survive
[1:55:04.040 --> 1:55:08.760]  oh survive the al-qaeda this perilous century
[1:55:08.760 --> 1:55:12.200]  during the course of a long intellectually demanding narrative
[1:55:12.200 --> 1:55:16.680]  this is how the article starts oh oh see it's so intellectually demanding
[1:55:16.680 --> 1:55:19.560]  see every line is laced with dripping with
[1:55:19.560 --> 1:55:23.640]  poisonous propaganda so someone reading this thinks oh to understand this
[1:55:23.640 --> 1:55:27.160]  i have to be very intellectual which means an average person reads this and
[1:55:27.160 --> 1:55:30.600]  knows that it's a bunch of tyranny but they say oh no you have to
[1:55:30.600 --> 1:55:34.600]  stress yourself to understand it
[1:55:34.600 --> 1:55:37.400]  during the course of a long intellectually demanding narrative
[1:55:37.400 --> 1:55:42.200]  terror and consent pivots on several paradigm shifting claims one of them
[1:55:42.200 --> 1:55:45.480]  which appears in the introduction stands out for its humanitarian
[1:55:45.480 --> 1:55:49.800]  implications during the era of the 20th century
[1:55:49.800 --> 1:55:52.920]  industrial nation states 80 of the dead and wounded
[1:55:52.920 --> 1:55:56.440]  in warfare were civilians
[1:55:56.440 --> 1:55:59.880]  we've had nation states for thousands of years
[1:55:59.880 --> 1:56:04.680]  they've always had huge wars its modern weapons
[1:56:04.680 --> 1:56:09.000]  that caused 80 of the casualties to be
[1:56:09.000 --> 1:56:12.680]  civilians so the implication is nation states kill
[1:56:12.680 --> 1:56:15.800]  civilians and kill large numbers of people
[1:56:15.800 --> 1:56:21.080]  intellectually bankrupt a fraud a lie has no connection to it
[1:56:21.080 --> 1:56:23.800]  except they would argue will nation states fight with each other so a world
[1:56:23.800 --> 1:56:26.680]  government would stop that but but that's a fraud as well the point is
[1:56:26.680 --> 1:56:30.440]  they hand out weapons to do to destabilize so they can take over
[1:56:30.440 --> 1:56:33.000]  but the fraudulent statement here is meant to say
[1:56:33.000 --> 1:56:37.000]  80 of the casualties were caused by the modern nation states
[1:56:37.000 --> 1:56:40.520]  when it was the modern weapons that did that
[1:56:40.520 --> 1:56:44.600]  nothing to do with the state for philip bobbitt
[1:56:44.600 --> 1:56:48.280]  and distinguished and distinguished lecturer
[1:56:48.280 --> 1:56:51.640]  and senior fellow at the university of texas and law professor
[1:56:51.640 --> 1:56:55.000]  at columbia university this is more than a g-wiz
[1:56:55.000 --> 1:56:59.880]  factoid it's the basis upon which he advocates an ambitious
[1:56:59.880 --> 1:57:03.000]  argument for fighting the wars that are bound to plague
[1:57:03.000 --> 1:57:06.280]  the 21st century
[1:57:09.000 --> 1:57:14.280]  the prospect because you see we're gonna have
[1:57:15.640 --> 1:57:19.800]  we're gonna have uh this this dangerous the war is the 21st century
[1:57:19.800 --> 1:57:22.840]  which if you read actually what the pentagon says the ministry defense say
[1:57:22.840 --> 1:57:26.280]  they say it's a war against individuals mopping up and enslaving the
[1:57:26.280 --> 1:57:29.080]  population i mean go read the new ministry defense
[1:57:29.080 --> 1:57:31.880]  report last year out of england just they just say point blank governments
[1:57:31.880 --> 1:57:35.240]  against the people the prospect that the good old
[1:57:35.240 --> 1:57:39.240]  industrial nation state is a shrinking of the good old see
[1:57:39.240 --> 1:57:43.240]  oh it's bygone it's old well what they're replacing it with is the ancient
[1:57:43.240 --> 1:57:48.200]  imperial model run by a group of technocrats
[1:57:48.200 --> 1:57:54.680]  with a penchant for eugenics and sadistic psychopathic behavior to see
[1:57:54.680 --> 1:57:59.720]  how that's propaganda the prospect of the good old industrial
[1:57:59.720 --> 1:58:03.640]  nation state see globalism destroys your industry then they say oh
[1:58:03.640 --> 1:58:06.920]  look the nation state the industrial nation state failed you
[1:58:06.920 --> 1:58:11.560]  then they blame it on nationalism see it's always they create the crisis off
[1:58:11.560 --> 1:58:14.840]  the solution we're going to continue here
[1:58:14.840 --> 1:58:17.480]  we're going to i'm going to read the whole article and analyze it

[2:01:23.720 --> 2:01:26.520]  university of texas and law professor at columbia university
[2:01:26.520 --> 2:01:31.240]  this is more than a g was factoid it's the basis upon which he advises an
[2:01:31.240 --> 2:01:34.840]  ambitious argument for fighting the wars that are bound
[2:01:34.840 --> 2:01:38.200]  to plague the 21st century we explain that's why they stage world war one
[2:01:38.200 --> 2:01:40.440]  and world war two in their own documents
[2:01:40.440 --> 2:01:44.360]  as lord millner wrote that they wanted to set up a world government
[2:01:44.360 --> 2:01:48.040]  and said oh we can't have any more wars same trick they play on us
[2:01:48.040 --> 2:01:51.400]  trick seems to work well now the people don't want it so they just say they're
[2:01:51.400 --> 2:01:54.280]  militarizing everything if you don't like it we'll just shove a gun down your
[2:01:54.280 --> 2:01:57.400]  throat and pull the trigger how's that sound bobbitt says
[2:01:57.400 --> 2:02:00.760]  the prospect that the good old industrial nation state is shrinking
[2:02:00.760 --> 2:02:03.960]  violent might wrinkle patriotic flag waivers but bobbitt's
[2:02:03.960 --> 2:02:08.280]  statistic thrust home an unsettling question
[2:02:08.280 --> 2:02:12.600]  oh he's got statistics you have nothing you just it's all crap
[2:02:12.600 --> 2:02:17.160]  what does it say about the nation state that he has so often failed to provide
[2:02:17.160 --> 2:02:24.120]  oh the nation state didn't provide it it messed up it was bad
[2:02:24.120 --> 2:02:28.360]  what does it say that the nation state has that has so often failed to provide
[2:02:28.360 --> 2:02:31.320]  the other in the words of british statesman douglas heard
[2:02:31.320 --> 2:02:34.360]  the security prosperity and the decent environment
[2:02:34.360 --> 2:02:38.280]  which the citizen demand might it be time for something new
[2:02:38.280 --> 2:02:41.960]  and then he goes on to propose no bill of rights no constitution no due process
[2:02:41.960 --> 2:02:45.800]  preemptive war oh that's what yes that's wonderful
[2:02:45.800 --> 2:02:49.800]  with a bunch of crooks running it banning protest and banning free speech
[2:02:49.800 --> 2:02:53.480]  and face scanning cameras oh yes bobbitt and cpsing people's
[2:02:53.480 --> 2:02:56.520]  children and hiring more cps with the money they get and
[2:02:56.520 --> 2:03:01.240]  then hiring more and in bobbitt's view the current wars against terror provide
[2:03:01.240 --> 2:03:04.680]  shrill wake-up call see they're not working well so we need more
[2:03:04.680 --> 2:03:09.160]  to confront the question the best way to protect citizens of modern democracies
[2:03:09.160 --> 2:03:12.920]  he claims is to fundamentally rethink the nation state
[2:03:12.920 --> 2:03:17.000]  as the guarantor of freedoms that terrorists intend to obliterate
[2:03:17.000 --> 2:03:20.840]  so he's saying we need to get rid of the nation state because the terrorists
[2:03:20.840 --> 2:03:24.280]  want to obliterate the nation state or we need to give up our liberties
[2:03:24.280 --> 2:03:27.320]  because the terrorists want our liberties
[2:03:27.320 --> 2:03:32.920]  i mean that is illogical that is a oxymoron but to a public that doesn't
[2:03:32.920 --> 2:03:36.600]  know what an oxymoron is they just go oh my god our freedom we better
[2:03:36.600 --> 2:03:39.640]  like the woman says in terror storm she goes i want to give up my liberty for
[2:03:39.640 --> 2:03:42.920]  freedom i want to give up my liberty for freedom
[2:03:42.920 --> 2:03:46.760]  john will you go will you tube that and find it i want to play p-brain we get
[2:03:46.760 --> 2:03:49.960]  back in bobbitt's view the current
[2:03:49.960 --> 2:03:53.240]  wars against terror provide a shrill wake-up call
[2:03:53.240 --> 2:03:57.160]  by the way they think your p-brains too the globalist they just pat you on the

[2:08:16.840 --> 2:08:23.320]  traders a little treacherous creature philip bobbitt
[2:08:24.680 --> 2:08:29.480]  bobbitt's previous book the shield of achilles
[2:08:29.480 --> 2:08:34.040]  explored the grand themes of warfare and state development
[2:08:34.040 --> 2:08:40.520]  marking his penchant for the magnus opus a nearly 700 page including more than
[2:08:40.520 --> 2:08:44.200]  100 pages of notes and i did read it it was just mindless
[2:08:44.200 --> 2:08:47.800]  drivel uh mix like they think mixing history in
[2:08:47.800 --> 2:08:51.320]  without even making the point and then a bunch of lies
[2:08:51.320 --> 2:08:55.640]  uh he is intellectual because these guys they're great great grandpas may have
[2:08:55.640 --> 2:08:57.960]  been smart but they're all inbred and basically
[2:08:57.960 --> 2:09:03.080]  about one IQ point above room temperature terror and consent that's the
[2:09:03.080 --> 2:09:06.440]  new uh book follows suit taking on a similarly big
[2:09:06.440 --> 2:09:10.040]  picture if we want to defeat state shattering terror
[2:09:10.040 --> 2:09:14.920]  state shattering terror in the 21st century bobbitt writes
[2:09:14.920 --> 2:09:18.360]  we will have to transform the emerging constitutional order
[2:09:18.360 --> 2:09:24.200]  of the 21st century state yes we've got to get rid of that to transform it
[2:09:24.200 --> 2:09:27.560]  specifically we must stop thinking like a nation state
[2:09:27.560 --> 2:09:31.480]  and start thinking like the market state while they fund
[2:09:31.480 --> 2:09:34.920]  nationalists to the south to overtake our country that's like lowering our
[2:09:34.920 --> 2:09:39.560]  immune system and then affecting us the nation state a constitutional order
[2:09:39.560 --> 2:09:44.200]  dedicated to protecting and improving the material welfare of its citizens
[2:09:44.200 --> 2:09:48.360]  served the united states well of the united states was served
[2:09:48.360 --> 2:09:52.120]  not the people from the mid 19th century to the end of the cold war
[2:09:52.120 --> 2:09:55.560]  see how it's all the needs of the state the state protecting the state
[2:09:55.560 --> 2:09:59.560]  to the end of the cold war but bobbitt contends it's vulnerable
[2:09:59.560 --> 2:10:03.400]  to a new battery of threats i remember a few weeks ago in england
[2:10:03.400 --> 2:10:07.480]  they had an article about bozzera saying that the shiite bozzer and
[2:10:07.480 --> 2:10:12.680]  iraqi military trained by the british wouldn't show allegiance to the state
[2:10:12.680 --> 2:10:16.120]  and and and put down their arms against the fellow shiites and
[2:10:16.120 --> 2:10:19.240]  it was terrible you couldn't indoctrinate them to serve and
[2:10:19.240 --> 2:10:23.800]  and and have allegiance to the state of course not of course it was to their
[2:10:23.800 --> 2:10:26.760]  countrymen and fellow people of the same religion
[2:10:26.760 --> 2:10:31.720]  not to use some outlander coming in there and then they were attacking the
[2:10:31.720 --> 2:10:35.000]  shiites to begin with so they couldn't be part of the election
[2:10:35.000 --> 2:10:39.400]  breaking a truce you have a dishonest treacherous
[2:10:39.400 --> 2:10:43.640]  but these people they turn treachery into into brotherhood they turn brotherhood
[2:10:43.640 --> 2:10:49.160]  into treason they turn uh freedom into into evil
[2:10:49.160 --> 2:10:52.680]  and war is slavery it's just all of it i just had it with these people war is
[2:10:52.680 --> 2:10:54.920]  peace
[2:10:55.800 --> 2:10:58.440]  specifically we must stop thinking of the nation state
[2:10:58.440 --> 2:11:02.600]  and start thinking like a market state that we are inevitably becoming
[2:11:02.600 --> 2:11:05.960]  you mean owned by a bunch of bankers who sold us out the nation's state of
[2:11:05.960 --> 2:11:09.080]  constitutional order dedicated to protecting and empowering material
[2:11:09.080 --> 2:11:13.320]  welfare of its citizens serve the united states well
[2:11:13.320 --> 2:11:17.320]  from the mid-19th century to the end of the cold war but bomb it contends it's
[2:11:17.320 --> 2:11:21.560]  vulnerable to a new battery of threats the accessibility of weapons of mass
[2:11:21.560 --> 2:11:24.680]  destruction which the u.s. government british gave to pakistan
[2:11:24.680 --> 2:11:27.560]  and india and the the the missile systems of the
[2:11:27.560 --> 2:11:31.320]  chinese and the reactors to the russians and all the technologies are handed out
[2:11:31.320 --> 2:11:35.560]  like hotcakes like in a western when the bad guy throws a gun down at the feet
[2:11:35.560 --> 2:11:38.920]  of the 12 year old then he goes for it and they shoot him
[2:11:38.920 --> 2:11:42.680]  the globalization of international capital and the universalization of
[2:11:42.680 --> 2:11:46.600]  culture have eroded the conventional borders that once legitimated
[2:11:46.600 --> 2:11:49.960]  national security so they say globalism's done this so we need more
[2:11:49.960 --> 2:11:55.480]  globalism now what's needed is a constitutional
[2:11:55.480 --> 2:12:00.040]  order that takes its structural cues from multinational corporations and
[2:12:00.040 --> 2:12:03.800]  non-governmental organizations now that's a key
[2:12:03.800 --> 2:12:09.080]  the new international order that takes its cues
[2:12:09.080 --> 2:12:14.200]  from the corporations and the non-governmental organizations so
[2:12:14.200 --> 2:12:17.880]  the corporations that already use the governments like a meat puppet
[2:12:17.880 --> 2:12:21.480]  a sock puppet that they that they articulate
[2:12:21.480 --> 2:12:26.600]  that they manipulate and control they steer
[2:12:26.600 --> 2:12:30.360]  now open door the ngo's will speak for the people
[2:12:30.360 --> 2:12:36.120]  the ngo's the u n let's come speak the ngo's funded by the corporations
[2:12:36.520 --> 2:12:40.120]  see regional boards that are unelected now have more power in texas than the
[2:12:40.120 --> 2:12:43.560]  city and the state it's just just they do whatever they want
[2:12:43.560 --> 2:12:48.200]  they have their own private SWAT teams and we don't like it die
[2:12:48.200 --> 2:12:51.960]  what's needed is a constitutional order that takes
[2:12:51.960 --> 2:12:54.760]  its structural cues from multinational corporations
[2:12:54.760 --> 2:12:58.920]  and non-governmental organizations relying less on law this is a quote
[2:12:58.920 --> 2:13:03.320]  less on law and regulation and more on market incentives yes
[2:13:03.320 --> 2:13:09.960]  let's not have law and regulation let's let's just do whatever we want
[2:13:09.960 --> 2:13:13.480]  to expand people's options oh yes it will expand people's options on having
[2:13:13.480 --> 2:13:17.640]  law such as market states keeps its finger
[2:13:17.640 --> 2:13:22.040]  on the pulse of consumer demand advocates he says
[2:13:22.040 --> 2:13:25.320]  such a market state keeps its finger on the pulse of consumer demand
[2:13:25.320 --> 2:13:30.600]  advocates trade liberalization is prone to the privatization of public works
[2:13:30.600 --> 2:13:34.680]  oh yes the people pay for it and then you hand it over to your buddies for
[2:13:34.680 --> 2:13:38.040]  nothing and then they triple the price but then they have a regional monopoly
[2:13:38.040 --> 2:13:41.880]  and cheat you so it's not free market it's corporations becoming tyrannical
[2:13:41.880 --> 2:13:45.240]  government but you know the public gets that confused and doesn't know what you
[2:13:45.240 --> 2:13:49.320]  are bob it such a market state keeps its finger on
[2:13:49.320 --> 2:13:52.680]  the pulse of consumer demand advocates trade liberalization is prone to
[2:13:52.680 --> 2:13:56.600]  privatization of public works and will outsource many functions those are
[2:13:56.600 --> 2:14:00.760]  quotes in the seminar seminar rooms of political
[2:14:00.760 --> 2:14:03.480]  science departments the change is referred to as
[2:14:03.480 --> 2:14:08.280]  neoliberalism on the streets it is known as globalization
[2:14:08.280 --> 2:14:13.720]  and bob it who is a geopolitical realist so see he's a realist you're not
[2:14:13.720 --> 2:14:17.560]  you know he knows what's realistic the truth is what they're doing isn't
[2:14:17.560 --> 2:14:22.200]  realistic it's very hard to push through it's very a lot of resistance
[2:14:22.200 --> 2:14:24.920]  but they're able to do it because they control the issuance of currency and
[2:14:24.920 --> 2:14:27.960]  credit and that this is a generational thing
[2:14:27.960 --> 2:14:30.840]  so let's get real it's very hard what you're doing and it's in a lot of trouble
[2:14:30.840 --> 2:14:34.040]  bob it and bob it who is a geopolitical
[2:14:34.040 --> 2:14:37.720]  realist believes we have no choice but to embrace it see the neocons are
[2:14:37.720 --> 2:14:42.120]  discredited so now the liberal bob it comes in with the exact same paradigm
[2:14:42.120 --> 2:14:47.800]  but with just neo-lib instead of neocon the market state bob it contends has
[2:14:47.800 --> 2:14:50.360]  great potential for the cause of individual freedom
[2:14:50.360 --> 2:14:53.720]  but it also has a dark side oh he's not going to be reasonable
[2:14:53.720 --> 2:14:57.000]  global terrorism has already taken advantage of its ethos
[2:14:57.000 --> 2:15:01.800]  of openness in order to undermine it oh yes the terrorist
[2:15:01.800 --> 2:15:05.480]  won our freedom so we must take it for example wide open arms market the
[2:15:05.480 --> 2:15:09.000]  neoliberalism endorses has allowed terrorists to gain access to weapons
[2:15:09.000 --> 2:15:12.440]  of destruction they then use to destabilize legitimate
[2:15:12.440 --> 2:15:15.560]  market states what do you mean are the criminals that run our
[2:15:15.560 --> 2:15:18.520]  government install nothing but dictatorships in the middle east they
[2:15:18.520 --> 2:15:24.040]  don't want democracy over there in fact they put religious sex in control
[2:15:24.680 --> 2:15:28.040]  back when they were main line and you go anywhere in the middle east and nobody
[2:15:28.040 --> 2:15:32.200]  attacked you and it was first world in the major cities and
[2:15:32.200 --> 2:15:36.840]  people weren't walking around in burkas the globalist went in and funded
[2:15:36.840 --> 2:15:40.440]  radical muslim groups it's a fact and then turned them loose and then now
[2:15:40.440 --> 2:15:43.240]  they quote deal with them and then when they take over
[2:15:43.240 --> 2:15:48.520]  iraq they put them in power so sick and then they'll remove them in power
[2:15:48.520 --> 2:15:52.920]  later it's just it's a business for example the wide open arms market the
[2:15:52.920 --> 2:15:56.440]  neoliberalism endorses has on allowed terrorists to gain access to weapons of
[2:15:56.440 --> 2:16:00.280]  destruction they then use to destabilize legitimate
[2:16:00.280 --> 2:16:05.320]  market states market state terrorism bob it explains
[2:16:05.320 --> 2:16:09.880]  thus feeds on to the ardently sought innovations of the 20th century
[2:16:09.880 --> 2:16:15.320]  to export the increasing vulnerability of market states to catastrophic events
[2:16:15.320 --> 2:16:19.000]  you mean the bankers have got control of our financial system so they can
[2:16:19.000 --> 2:16:22.680]  torture the daylights out of us and then every time they do it they stage some
[2:16:22.680 --> 2:16:25.400]  little terror attack and claim it did it and claim the terrorist
[2:16:25.400 --> 2:16:28.360]  had the power to bring down the market when it was really you just sharing
[2:16:28.360 --> 2:16:32.440]  your your sheep what is to be done remember they always
[2:16:32.440 --> 2:16:35.880]  create the crisis and then already are promoting the solution before their
[2:16:35.880 --> 2:16:39.880]  crisis is even created then they always stand around going
[2:16:39.880 --> 2:16:45.720]  we're geniuses we predicted the exact attack that happened
[2:16:45.720 --> 2:16:49.560]  what is to be done this is not fear mongering oh this is not fear mongering
[2:16:49.560 --> 2:16:52.760]  uh but rather a sophisticated so he's sophisticated
[2:16:52.760 --> 2:16:56.760]  geopolitical assessment oh you when you read these words like
[2:16:56.760 --> 2:17:00.200]  sophistication oh you're so sophisticated reading this
[2:17:00.200 --> 2:17:05.080]  in the in the in the newspaper therefore a great deal rest on the
[2:17:05.080 --> 2:17:10.040]  solutions bomb it offers
[2:17:10.040 --> 2:17:17.400]  but never fear it says fortunately his suggestions are if not entirely novel
[2:17:17.400 --> 2:17:21.080]  largely sensible oh like getting rid of the bill of rights
[2:17:21.080 --> 2:17:25.800]  sneak attacking countries having no more uh representative government oh
[2:17:25.800 --> 2:17:30.520]  very simple it's the sensible sophisticated
[2:17:30.520 --> 2:17:34.280]  assessment you know these are the words this is just
[2:17:34.280 --> 2:17:41.480]  outrageous just total tyranny on its face
[2:17:42.840 --> 2:17:47.000]  hitler it wasn't this bold Stalin now
[2:17:47.880 --> 2:17:52.040]  Julius Caesar they just did it but they lied and said they were not these guys
[2:17:52.040 --> 2:17:57.720]  they just say torture children with pliers
[2:17:57.720 --> 2:18:01.720]  fortunately oh fortunately he's going to save us
[2:18:01.720 --> 2:18:05.640]  his suggestions are if not entirely novel which they're not
[2:18:05.640 --> 2:18:11.880]  largely sensible i'm glad somebody is but they are ambitious to the point of
[2:18:11.880 --> 2:18:16.280]  being unachievable without extraordinary political leadership
[2:18:16.280 --> 2:18:21.800]  an unprecedented corporate discipline and they have all these big corporate
[2:18:21.800 --> 2:18:24.840]  retreats and if you tell this line they give you bigger jobs and
[2:18:24.840 --> 2:18:28.280]  more power and you move up they have unlimited money they have whole
[2:18:28.280 --> 2:18:31.240]  corporate structures with guys making five hundred grand a million five
[2:18:31.240 --> 2:18:35.160]  million twenty million two hundred million a year doing almost nothing
[2:18:35.160 --> 2:18:39.720]  but just doing evil going along with it
[2:18:39.720 --> 2:18:43.880]  they are ambitions to the point of being unachievable without
[2:18:43.880 --> 2:18:50.280]  extraordinary political leadership an unprecedented corporate discipline
[2:18:50.280 --> 2:18:53.400]  aren't we lucky we have this why i don't read a lot of articles in whole because
[2:18:53.400 --> 2:18:57.640]  if i do i just analyze them to death first bob it argues that the market
[2:18:57.640 --> 2:19:01.400]  state must allow the time-worn strategies
[2:19:01.400 --> 2:19:07.320]  of deterrence and containment to yield to the more aggressive tactics
[2:19:07.320 --> 2:19:11.400]  of preclusionary warfare that's a way to say preemptive
[2:19:11.400 --> 2:19:14.680]  but that word's now been been discredited so now it's
[2:19:14.680 --> 2:19:20.280]  preclusionary warfare and they'll change it again

[2:23:57.160 --> 2:24:02.440]  we are probably not going to go into marshal law overnight
[2:24:02.440 --> 2:24:06.600]  it's a marshal law system
[2:24:06.600 --> 2:24:11.000]  jesus you know first it's in the airports and it's on the
[2:24:11.000 --> 2:24:16.120]  trains then the streets being randomly searched then it's the highways and it's
[2:24:16.120 --> 2:24:22.200]  schools now happening curfews after 10 10 30 in
[2:24:22.200 --> 2:24:26.280]  major cities for adults mean question more and more police
[2:24:26.280 --> 2:24:33.880]  not having due process what philip bob at the university of texas one of the
[2:24:33.880 --> 2:24:40.760]  top globalist writing up policy at the lbj school of law
[2:24:40.760 --> 2:24:46.120]  and public affairs and also columbia
[2:24:46.120 --> 2:24:50.040]  they're talking about a marshal law system
[2:24:50.040 --> 2:24:53.640]  marshal law doesn't have to be the hot marshal law lockdown cities and
[2:24:53.640 --> 2:24:56.760]  door to their gun confiscations they just do it slowly door to door sector by
[2:24:56.760 --> 2:24:59.640]  sector confiscating the guns as they're now getting ready for and that's
[2:24:59.640 --> 2:25:05.080]  coming up later i got a bunch of gun confiscation news coming up
[2:25:05.080 --> 2:25:11.240]  but uh finishing up with this it just goes on and on
[2:25:11.240 --> 2:25:15.320]  bob it argues that the market state must allow the time-worn strategies of
[2:25:15.320 --> 2:25:19.320]  deterrence and containment to yield to a more aggressive tactics
[2:25:19.320 --> 2:25:23.080]  of preclusionary warfare which is preemptive
[2:25:23.080 --> 2:25:32.680]  in a war which we're in market states share the burden of
[2:25:32.680 --> 2:25:37.320]  employing power preclusionary rather than waiting for
[2:25:37.320 --> 2:25:43.000]  an acute crisis to set in that irrevocably puts us at a disadvantage
[2:25:43.000 --> 2:25:45.880]  so just attacking people all the time and who is us
[2:25:45.880 --> 2:25:49.800]  not the people the elite it's their interest remember it's their interest
[2:25:49.800 --> 2:25:53.800]  not your interest venturing educated guesses about the
[2:25:53.800 --> 2:25:58.840]  behavior of future threats is no one's idea of an ideal tactical
[2:25:58.840 --> 2:26:03.080]  strategy but bomb it argues that if we strengthen our alliances with other
[2:26:03.080 --> 2:26:05.960]  states networks of shared intelligence
[2:26:05.960 --> 2:26:09.400]  could do an impressive job of it what do you mean we're already merged with
[2:26:09.400 --> 2:26:12.040]  europe of course that just means an america as
[2:26:12.040 --> 2:26:15.400]  an american you can't run over there they're after you or vice versa
[2:26:15.400 --> 2:26:18.120]  it's all about the individual this is all about war on individual not even
[2:26:18.120 --> 2:26:21.320]  rogue states of course this would require a more invasive
[2:26:21.320 --> 2:26:25.960]  process of information gathering within and across national borders
[2:26:25.960 --> 2:26:29.800]  in order to reduce the threat of civil liberties this would entail bobbin
[2:26:29.800 --> 2:26:33.480]  highlights our commitment to globalize the systems of human rights and
[2:26:33.480 --> 2:26:37.160]  government by consent but that's just where they
[2:26:37.160 --> 2:26:40.360]  claim the ngo's say they don't want a fourth amendment
[2:26:40.360 --> 2:26:43.960]  that's got that's what to get a mayor cotch said he said europe doesn't want
[2:26:43.960 --> 2:26:47.400]  a first amendment they want to not have any rights they like it
[2:26:47.400 --> 2:26:50.840]  they like not being able to vote on the uu they like it
[2:26:50.840 --> 2:26:55.720]  no they don't he insists that emerging market states
[2:26:55.720 --> 2:26:59.800]  must collectively out of self-respect define and protect
[2:26:59.800 --> 2:27:06.520]  our inalible rights what this means is concrete terms and that
[2:27:06.520 --> 2:27:10.280]  governments must rethink ideas like humli and security
[2:27:10.280 --> 2:27:13.880]  so again sounds reasonable none of it is because then he
[2:27:13.880 --> 2:27:16.840]  it's just like gary hart playing a liberal saying i never said new world
[2:27:16.840 --> 2:27:20.840]  order that's a lie let me have video of him saying it i mean this is how they
[2:27:20.840 --> 2:27:23.720]  operate he even gave a speech a few months
[2:27:23.720 --> 2:27:27.880]  ago he said just like i said years ago we need a new world order
[2:27:27.880 --> 2:27:31.160]  and then later to a crowd i never said that
[2:27:31.160 --> 2:27:36.520]  he's still in the paradigm of of they're not being youtube and google
[2:27:36.520 --> 2:27:39.960]  and and thousands of other places to see video
[2:27:39.960 --> 2:27:43.640]  he ten years ago he could get away with that 20 years ago i never said that
[2:27:43.640 --> 2:27:47.560]  people would look at the young man saying oh that young communist liar
[2:27:47.560 --> 2:27:53.640]  he doesn't like gary hart but you can't do it now can you punk
[2:27:53.640 --> 2:27:59.160]  when the threats to security cannot be neatly
[2:28:00.520 --> 2:28:04.040]  combined as in or out of the homeland
[2:28:04.040 --> 2:28:08.040]  or neatly cabin that an alliance of democracies must form
[2:28:08.040 --> 2:28:11.960]  to discourage isolationism oh that means global government
[2:28:11.960 --> 2:28:14.920]  and that the united states must change its role as
[2:28:14.920 --> 2:28:20.600]  hegemon in nato so give up any supremacy we have which was always the plan
[2:28:20.600 --> 2:28:23.480]  we do the dirty work for the next step of the new world order then we take the
[2:28:23.480 --> 2:28:27.000]  blame for it and then they expand the next wave
[2:28:27.000 --> 2:28:32.440]  only then can a consortium of neoliberal democracies draw a bright line
[2:28:32.440 --> 2:28:35.960]  rule against the international inflection of pain
[2:28:35.960 --> 2:28:40.680]  on any person detained by government one of the many human rights threats that
[2:28:40.680 --> 2:28:44.440]  bomb it believes we must address these developments
[2:28:44.440 --> 2:28:49.160]  the acceptance of preclusionary war the universalization of human rights
[2:28:49.160 --> 2:28:51.720]  hinge on a revamping of international law
[2:28:51.720 --> 2:28:55.080]  bobbitt believes that the un charter should be amended to allow the
[2:28:55.080 --> 2:28:58.760]  preemptive use of force without a security council authorization
[2:28:58.760 --> 2:29:02.280]  so see he's saying we've got to fight tyranny we've got to have tyranny

[2:33:06.760 --> 2:33:10.360]  okay we're back live
[2:33:10.360 --> 2:33:12.840]  i want to get into the economy and then i'm going to briefly get into the
[2:33:12.840 --> 2:33:15.480]  government is trying to wrap its mind around yours
[2:33:15.480 --> 2:33:19.720]  i've been to spend hours on the story and i haven't done it in three days
[2:33:19.720 --> 2:33:23.400]  four days i've mentioned it's sunday
[2:33:24.120 --> 2:33:28.600]  on the economic front uh the bankers by design
[2:33:28.600 --> 2:33:32.520]  and again i made a film with footage shot two and three years ago where we said
[2:33:32.520 --> 2:33:35.400]  they would implode the subprime mortgage market
[2:33:35.400 --> 2:33:38.440]  then even the financial times of london has admitted that that's the case it's
[2:33:38.440 --> 2:33:42.680]  all being done by design we've had ron paul on another economist on
[2:33:42.680 --> 2:33:45.880]  to tell you that it's being done by design
[2:33:45.880 --> 2:33:49.880]  uh and they are trying to suppress the price of gold but it's just not working
[2:33:49.880 --> 2:33:53.160]  they've been trying to suppress it down below 400 for years and
[2:33:53.160 --> 2:33:57.480]  it has really rallied today going up to 950 and back and forth
[2:33:57.480 --> 2:34:04.680]  $950 an ounce silver uh going way up dollar falls for record against euro
[2:34:04.680 --> 2:34:08.520]  as EU inflation quickens now i got up this morning and i saw that
[2:34:08.520 --> 2:34:11.560]  headline i said well let me look at gold it'll be way up
[2:34:11.560 --> 2:34:14.840]  and it was up $20
[2:34:15.320 --> 2:34:20.040]  yeah and that's with the imf this week and last week dumping tens of billions
[2:34:20.040 --> 2:34:24.280]  of dollars of gold in the market at below spot trying to drive the market
[2:34:24.280 --> 2:34:28.040]  down and it isn't working you need to use this as an incentive
[2:34:28.040 --> 2:34:31.720]  now to get into precious metals ladies and gentlemen before it blasts right
[2:34:31.720 --> 2:34:35.800]  past a thousand it should be over $2,300 an ounce now
[2:34:35.800 --> 2:34:39.720]  for how far the dollars drop the dollar is at an all-time low
[2:34:39.720 --> 2:34:42.680]  and it'll it'll go down a little bit more and then it'll it'll gain a few cents
[2:34:42.680 --> 2:34:46.360]  back but if you look at the graph on a yearly graph it's going
[2:34:46.360 --> 2:34:49.560]  straight down but the media makes you focus on the
[2:34:49.560 --> 2:34:56.520]  day-to-day week-to-week it's the graph it's the graph
[2:34:56.520 --> 2:35:06.120]  gold boost my fresh dollar losses oil gains oil at all time record high
[2:35:06.120 --> 2:35:13.400]  unbelievable spot gold hit a record high of 1030.80 an ounce
[2:35:13.400 --> 2:35:17.640]  on march 17th it is now headed back that direction
[2:35:17.640 --> 2:35:23.000]  and that's Reuters we've got uh bloomberg here the dollar fell to a record low
[2:35:23.000 --> 2:35:27.000]  against the euro after european inflation accelerated in march
[2:35:27.000 --> 2:35:29.960]  reducing the chances that the region central bank will follow the fellow
[2:35:29.960 --> 2:35:32.440]  reserve and cutting interest rates that's right
[2:35:32.440 --> 2:35:35.240]  and when europe doesn't cut interest rates and our interest rates are at 2
[2:35:35.240 --> 2:35:38.520]  percent and their interest rates are at five and a half on average in europe
[2:35:38.520 --> 2:35:42.200]  some places higher some places lower what are people going to buy
[2:35:42.200 --> 2:35:46.840]  they're going to buy foreign currencies not the dollar it's worthless
[2:35:46.840 --> 2:35:52.920]  in interest and in its true value so the dollar has dropped to an all
[2:35:52.920 --> 2:36:00.360]  time high of 160 to the euro 160 a euro is
[2:36:00.360 --> 2:36:03.720]  worth 160 to the dollar in 2000 when the euro
[2:36:03.720 --> 2:36:10.600]  opened it was worth 82 cents to the dollar so what's 60 and 18
[2:36:10.600 --> 2:36:18.520]  60 and 18 a 78 point swing
[2:36:18.520 --> 2:36:23.000]  60 cents on the face with another 18 points
[2:36:23.000 --> 2:36:27.720]  the fundamentals are all there and the facts are there
[2:36:27.720 --> 2:36:32.120]  that the dollar is going to continue to slide i pray it slides slowly
[2:36:32.120 --> 2:36:35.640]  because then it won't be too much of a complete panic or in the streets
[2:36:35.640 --> 2:36:38.520]  but it could just you know two months from now you're from now
[2:36:38.520 --> 2:36:42.280]  tomorrow you don't know could just suddenly start plunging 20 cents a day
[2:36:42.280 --> 2:36:46.200]  and then it's it's going to be runs on banks hysteria i mean we're sitting on
[2:36:46.200 --> 2:36:49.240]  top of powder keg it's like climbing in a lion's den
[2:36:49.240 --> 2:36:52.120]  people fall in lions dens you know a couple times a year and most times
[2:36:52.120 --> 2:36:56.920]  lions just lay there and ignore you but sometimes you fall in they attack you
[2:36:56.920 --> 2:37:01.000]  and kill you well we're sitting on top of lion
[2:37:01.000 --> 2:37:05.800]  that's hungry in a pit and i don't know what it's going to do i just know this
[2:37:05.800 --> 2:37:09.800]  there's a rope out of the pit and it's called gold oil hits a new record as
[2:37:09.800 --> 2:37:13.080]  investors flee falling dollar this is uh out of the
[2:37:13.080 --> 2:37:17.640]  associated presses well weakening dollars since oil
[2:37:17.640 --> 2:37:21.160]  prices are records high above 114 dollars a barrel is dollar
[2:37:21.160 --> 2:37:23.560]  tumbles
[2:37:24.040 --> 2:37:27.960]  well and and and people are still having debates domestically it's everyone
[2:37:27.960 --> 2:37:32.040]  knows it in foreign countries because they're in reality here it's like
[2:37:32.040 --> 2:37:36.680]  i wonder boils up because the dollar's low i wonder if gold's up
[2:37:36.680 --> 2:37:41.080]  people say well the government says they want a strong dollar that's why
[2:37:41.080 --> 2:37:45.080]  they're trying to dump gold no they want you to only know about the weak
[2:37:45.080 --> 2:37:47.880]  dollars so you don't have a place to escape to like gold
[2:37:47.880 --> 2:37:53.080]  they're doing both whoever said economic reality played any part in this
[2:37:53.080 --> 2:37:57.160]  i know this they are devaluing your dollar by more than 70 percent they've
[2:37:57.160 --> 2:37:59.400]  now done it by more than 70 percent from what it opened
[2:37:59.400 --> 2:38:07.160]  60 plus percent from parity with the euro and uh gold is going up
[2:38:07.160 --> 2:38:12.120]  gold futures rally as dollar falls sharply gold futures have gold even higher
[2:38:12.120 --> 2:38:15.880]  in the weeks to come and the futures are almost always correct so
[2:38:15.880 --> 2:38:18.840]  uh ted anderson did an offer here yesterday
[2:38:18.840 --> 2:38:24.680]  and uh he has gold priced out at back when it was like 920
[2:38:24.680 --> 2:38:31.640]  and uh so he has that gold in stock and so you can get uh gold at very very
[2:38:31.640 --> 2:38:35.400]  affordable prices because ted has secured it
[2:38:35.400 --> 2:38:40.120]  before gold went up but in every case we've told you that it's happened
[2:38:40.120 --> 2:38:43.240]  as it continues to go up in a few days a week we're not sure
[2:38:43.240 --> 2:38:47.160]  he won't be able to offer this when it runs out i didn't even ask him he has
[2:38:47.160 --> 2:38:50.360]  any silver major suppliers sold out all over
[2:38:50.360 --> 2:38:55.080]  uh ted what do you have to offer today well like you said alex uh you know i
[2:38:55.080 --> 2:38:58.760]  am smart enough to know that i need to secure my positions on these dips i
[2:38:58.760 --> 2:39:01.720]  mean i wish people were on the dealer side of this market so they could see
[2:39:01.720 --> 2:39:06.920]  what's going on uh supplies are very tight uh a lot of the dealers especially
[2:39:06.920 --> 2:39:09.960]  silver just like you said we do have silver dollars right now
[2:39:09.960 --> 2:39:13.400]  and i can carry over that special that we talked about yesterday for silver
[2:39:13.400 --> 2:39:16.280]  dollars at five seventy eight per roll of 20
[2:39:16.280 --> 2:39:20.760]  um the uh the gold market is also tight right now i mean obviously with the
[2:39:20.760 --> 2:39:24.280]  dollar falling like it is and and you look at it today what is it right now i
[2:39:24.280 --> 2:39:30.680]  looked at it uh what was it 71 42 uh that's as low as i've seen yet
[2:39:30.680 --> 2:39:34.280]  you know and it and it's going to continue to drop because the united
[2:39:34.280 --> 2:39:37.240]  states is into this deficit spending bench
[2:39:37.240 --> 2:39:40.600]  and every time that we have a problem here in the united states something
[2:39:40.600 --> 2:39:43.240]  crops up they always look to the federal reserve
[2:39:43.240 --> 2:39:46.840]  system to print more money in lower interest rates and to stimulate the
[2:39:46.840 --> 2:39:50.040]  economy uh the united states of america was a
[2:39:50.040 --> 2:39:54.280]  was a uh was a uh world you know world
[2:39:54.280 --> 2:39:57.880]  renowned currency we were the we were the arm of stability
[2:39:57.880 --> 2:40:02.200]  because of the fact that we were backed by gold through 1971
[2:40:02.200 --> 2:40:06.200]  and since the uh since the uh war in uh vietnam
[2:40:06.200 --> 2:40:09.960]  nixon took us off that gold standard in it and we've just done nothing but to
[2:40:09.960 --> 2:40:14.040]  try to destroy the dollar and now finally it's all showing up here
[2:40:14.040 --> 2:40:17.080]  uh and that's why we're seeing the dollar fall and it'll go on further
[2:40:17.080 --> 2:40:20.280]  because i'm you just watch what happens anytime we're gonna have a problem
[2:40:20.280 --> 2:40:23.160]  here they're gonna they're gonna go to printing money
[2:40:23.160 --> 2:40:26.760]  and uh it just like you said like ron paul said like paul crepe robert
[2:40:26.760 --> 2:40:30.120]  is saying like just about every economist out there saying right now the
[2:40:30.120 --> 2:40:33.320]  dollar is doomed because of the fact that foreigners want to get away from the
[2:40:33.320 --> 2:40:37.080]  u.s currency i mean 1.3 trillion dollars over in
[2:40:37.080 --> 2:40:40.840]  in uh in uh um japan i'm sorry over in uh
[2:40:40.840 --> 2:40:43.800]  china what do you think they want to do they want to get away from the dollar
[2:40:43.800 --> 2:40:47.080]  right now they're they're they're showing that but they're with their feet
[2:40:47.080 --> 2:40:50.520]  oil prices going up is another thing it's a commodity gold is going to go up
[2:40:50.520 --> 2:40:52.760]  they are trying to suppress the price of gold
[2:40:52.760 --> 2:40:55.640]  they're more successful with suppressing the price of gold right now
[2:40:55.640 --> 2:40:59.160]  then they are with oil but it's like a rubber band anytime you try to hold
[2:40:59.160 --> 2:41:01.880]  something down it springs up even further
[2:41:01.880 --> 2:41:05.800]  and uh and so yeah right now there's no question about it gold is at a good
[2:41:05.800 --> 2:41:09.400]  buying range and currently what i have what i locked in on is
[2:41:09.400 --> 2:41:14.120]  are these british sovereigns they're at 257 dollars per coin
[2:41:14.120 --> 2:41:19.240]  and then i have the french frank at 205 uh both of those coins are just it's
[2:41:19.240 --> 2:41:23.240]  like getting involved with something that's small enough that you can trade
[2:41:23.240 --> 2:41:27.480]  if you have to buy gold if you have to buy food and and pay your house
[2:41:27.480 --> 2:41:31.400]  payments make a car payment that kind of thing at the dollar really falls here
[2:41:31.400 --> 2:41:35.240]  i mean there's no sense of having to lose your property and and and and having
[2:41:35.240 --> 2:41:37.560]  to starve because we go into a depression
[2:41:37.560 --> 2:41:40.440]  which are just about every economist is talking about
[2:41:40.440 --> 2:41:44.520]  if you have the gold you'll be buying food and uh you'll be buying the things
[2:41:44.520 --> 2:41:48.120]  the staples that you need because gold is money it has been for over six
[2:41:48.120 --> 2:41:52.840]  thousand years just as an investment with with the entire financial order
[2:41:52.840 --> 2:41:57.640]  teetering on the edge of a knife it is completely mindless to not move heavily
[2:41:57.640 --> 2:42:00.840]  into commodities and the most portable and and the
[2:42:00.840 --> 2:42:04.200]  traditionally safest place to be is precious metals and gold
[2:42:04.200 --> 2:42:07.400]  is at the tip top of that pyramid of investments
[2:42:07.400 --> 2:42:11.560]  give them the number ten yeah they can catch us at 1-800

[2:42:31.720 --> 2:42:35.640]  the in the world economy and it's getting it's getting more and more
[2:42:35.640 --> 2:42:41.960]  volatile every minute 1-800-686-2237 and ted's got gold at the
[2:42:41.960 --> 2:42:45.720]  price it was last week gold is shooting up right now

[2:42:50.840 --> 2:42:54.040]  and tell them again about the gold coins you've got on special
[2:42:54.040 --> 2:42:57.480]  yeah sure we've got the british sovereign coin which is a quarter of an ounce
[2:42:57.480 --> 2:43:01.400]  gold coin right now they're at 257 dollars per coin
[2:43:01.400 --> 2:43:05.640]  we also have the french frank coin which is one fifth of an ounce
[2:43:05.640 --> 2:43:08.600]  uh... we have the silver dollars now these are the silver dollars outlooks
[2:43:08.600 --> 2:43:12.760]  that were manufactured by the united states government meant to be used here
[2:43:12.760 --> 2:43:18.920]  as one dollar in currency all the way up through and what was in 1934
[2:43:18.920 --> 2:43:22.200]  and uh... and so they're available as well
[2:43:22.200 --> 2:43:26.120]  uh... that stuff is in real short supply of the they quit making those back in
[2:43:26.120 --> 2:43:31.320]  the early 1900s uh... they melted a lot of them off in 1981 silver one up to
[2:43:31.320 --> 2:43:34.120]  fifty dollars yeah folks need to give you a call for
[2:43:34.120 --> 2:43:36.680]  months you haven't even had silver dollars and you couldn't get them at a
[2:43:36.680 --> 2:43:41.640]  reasonable price 1-800-686-2237 Ted thanks
[2:43:41.640 --> 2:43:44.520]  yeah thanks a lot for having me up Alex you bet thank you Ted
[2:43:44.520 --> 2:43:50.120]  yeah we spent about 10 minutes on that because it is very important 1-800-686-2237
[2:43:50.120 --> 2:43:54.600]  look i know we got loaded phone lines and we got the fourth hour coming up
[2:43:54.600 --> 2:43:58.440]  what i want to do because i don't want to be unfair to all these callers is john
[2:43:58.440 --> 2:44:01.880]  give them my fourth hour call in line and we'll put them all at the head of the
[2:44:01.880 --> 2:44:04.600]  line because i want to talk to all these people
[2:44:04.600 --> 2:44:08.760]  that are patiently holding uh... and we'll go ahead and open the phone lines
[2:44:08.760 --> 2:44:15.760]  uh... but uh...
[2:44:16.360 --> 2:44:20.120]  and john you can give them that number it's five one two six four six five four
[2:44:20.120 --> 2:44:24.680]  zero zero five one two six four six five four zero zero
[2:44:24.680 --> 2:44:28.680]  and we'll put vince and joshua and randy and chris and john
[2:44:28.680 --> 2:44:31.880]  at the head of the line and i'll take their calls immediately when we start
[2:44:31.880 --> 2:44:35.640]  the fourth hour into overdrive here
[2:44:35.640 --> 2:44:39.800]  uh... but uh... and we're open phone up in just a few minutes ladies and
[2:44:39.800 --> 2:44:42.200]  gentlemen
[2:44:42.200 --> 2:44:46.360]  but before i do that i want to go ahead and play this gun control piece and the
[2:44:46.360 --> 2:44:50.120]  problem is there's so many lies everything is crafted for lies
[2:44:50.120 --> 2:44:53.640]  that if i stop it and come in at each point i'll never
[2:44:53.640 --> 2:44:58.840]  be able to air it notice that that it starts out
[2:44:58.840 --> 2:45:04.520]  identical to a dc piece
[2:45:04.520 --> 2:45:08.200]  and then they sell the whole thing like
[2:45:08.200 --> 2:45:13.320]  the people wanted and it's bad teenagers and the parents are scared and they
[2:45:13.320 --> 2:45:18.040]  the parents call the cops to come out and confiscate the guns now
[2:45:18.040 --> 2:45:21.960]  in dc in new york uh... in dallas
[2:45:21.960 --> 2:45:28.200]  uh... in tucson in many other cities
[2:45:28.200 --> 2:45:33.880]  of course there's also uh... it's going on in boston
[2:45:33.880 --> 2:45:36.760]  is just so amazing on people understand the import of what we're talking about
[2:45:36.760 --> 2:45:38.760]  here
[2:45:38.760 --> 2:45:42.200]  they come in
[2:45:42.200 --> 2:45:46.200]  and
[2:45:46.200 --> 2:45:50.360]  they come to your door and they say do you have any legal guns
[2:45:50.360 --> 2:45:53.080]  well why won't you let me in we need to let me search
[2:45:53.080 --> 2:45:56.440]  or if it's in dallas or other areas that are pro-guns still have some second
[2:45:56.440 --> 2:45:59.720]  amendment they say mind if i do a safety inspection that's all been in the
[2:45:59.720 --> 2:46:02.680]  newspapers we've covered it for about eight years
[2:46:02.680 --> 2:46:05.400]  since we've seven eight years since we learned it was going on in tucson in
[2:46:05.400 --> 2:46:08.760]  dallas and they call that knock and talk now this new
[2:46:08.760 --> 2:46:11.400]  one they admit they go to doors and they ask and say
[2:46:11.400 --> 2:46:14.520]  we want to search for legal guns mind if we search
[2:46:14.520 --> 2:46:17.480]  but then when they get criticized they come back with
[2:46:17.480 --> 2:46:21.400]  oh the parents call us the the parents want their kids to be safe
[2:46:21.400 --> 2:46:24.600]  but don't worry we're not going to prosecute them but then now they're
[2:46:24.600 --> 2:46:27.080]  having to admit well actually we do look for marijuana
[2:46:27.080 --> 2:46:30.440]  and we do prosecute you so it's also a lie
[2:46:30.440 --> 2:46:33.880]  i mean they lie to the public it's a military operation
[2:46:33.880 --> 2:46:36.760]  and remember new orleans first thing they did they wouldn't bring food and water
[2:46:36.760 --> 2:46:40.360]  in for five days they went into high and dry areas wealthy areas and took the
[2:46:40.360 --> 2:46:43.560]  guns so we're going to play this oakland
[2:46:43.560 --> 2:46:47.400]  piece that's total deception with women saying they love it they want it
[2:46:47.400 --> 2:46:50.440]  kind of like deceptive pieces that say hey everybody ought to take their shots
[2:46:50.440 --> 2:46:53.400]  it's the law i don't want my babies to be sick
[2:46:53.400 --> 2:46:56.600]  we have similar pieces with the force inoculations but it's not the law they
[2:46:56.600 --> 2:46:58.840]  just say it's the law and threaten you
[2:46:58.840 --> 2:47:03.320]  it's just look this is so incredibly deceptive i'm going to play
[2:47:03.320 --> 2:47:07.240]  the piece out of oakland first then the piece out of dc here it is
[2:47:07.240 --> 2:47:11.320]  would you invite police into your home to look for guns
[2:47:11.320 --> 2:47:15.160]  robert liles on a proposal in oakland that would have officers searching
[2:47:15.160 --> 2:47:18.200]  houses for weapons without a warrant robert
[2:47:18.200 --> 2:47:21.800]  well again a fundamental constitutional right is the right against
[2:47:21.800 --> 2:47:26.280]  unlawful search and seizure inside your home that's why some here in oakland
[2:47:26.280 --> 2:47:30.600]  were surprised to hear that a plan has been green lighted that would allow
[2:47:30.600 --> 2:47:34.840]  police inside your home without that warrant now as you're about to hear
[2:47:34.840 --> 2:47:38.600]  supporters say you lose nothing but civil libertarians say
[2:47:38.600 --> 2:47:44.120]  if this passes there's no telling what you may lose
[2:47:44.120 --> 2:47:49.800]  your home may be your castle but by summer you could receive a wrap from an
[2:47:49.800 --> 2:47:53.080]  oakland cop looking for guns this is about consent
[2:47:53.080 --> 2:47:56.280]  so nobody's going into anybody's home who doesn't get permission
[2:47:56.280 --> 2:47:59.880]  oakland council member deslie brooks has proposed something unheard of in
[2:47:59.880 --> 2:48:04.040]  california a consent to search program instead of cops
[2:48:04.040 --> 2:48:08.120]  gathering a warrant seeking a gun that may have been involved in a crime
[2:48:08.120 --> 2:48:12.040]  homeowners call the cops and voluntarily let them in
[2:48:12.040 --> 2:48:16.040]  under this pilot program the gun is removed and no criminal actions are
[2:48:16.040 --> 2:48:18.920]  pursued with one exception if the guns have been
[2:48:18.920 --> 2:48:22.040]  involved in a homicide or a shooting obviously we have to
[2:48:22.040 --> 2:48:25.800]  look at those issues and we have to follow up
[2:48:25.800 --> 2:48:30.200]  with oakland's motor rate at nearly 40 lives the pilot program isn't hard to
[2:48:30.200 --> 2:48:32.920]  sell to some i think it's a good idea i will call the
[2:48:32.920 --> 2:48:37.080]  police because i wouldn't want a gun in my home consent to search isn't new
[2:48:37.080 --> 2:48:41.560]  homeowners in st louis boston and washington dc have already allowed
[2:48:41.560 --> 2:48:45.400]  cops in looking for guns okay stop right there
[2:48:45.400 --> 2:48:49.400]  see that's what this is meant for the perception that well we've already done
[2:48:49.400 --> 2:48:52.360]  this before i mean why didn't jeffrey domers say
[2:48:52.360 --> 2:48:56.440]  hey when the cops showed up hey i've killed people before why is it wrong now
[2:48:56.440 --> 2:49:01.240]  just a big positive piece the the image of police coming and searching
[2:49:01.240 --> 2:49:05.400]  for guns in a city like oakland where they don't have a lot of gun laws
[2:49:05.400 --> 2:49:09.960]  compared to other parts of california now here's the other newscast out of dc
[2:49:09.960 --> 2:49:13.480]  where you got police saying it's horrible and it's unconstitutional
[2:49:13.480 --> 2:49:17.080]  this is the difference this is an honest news piece versus
[2:49:17.080 --> 2:49:20.600]  a pack of liars here it is they say they have more requests
[2:49:20.600 --> 2:49:24.840]  than they can respond to but others think what's his plan is a slippery slope
[2:49:24.840 --> 2:49:28.760]  if a cop can enter a house or anybody can enter a house
[2:49:28.760 --> 2:49:32.200]  without a warrant for guns then they could impure a house for something else
[2:49:32.200 --> 2:49:37.560]  that's exactly what makes the aclu nervous they tell cbs five as it stands
[2:49:37.560 --> 2:49:41.320]  many people don't know they have the right to refuse a police request
[2:49:41.320 --> 2:49:44.520]  to enter their home and once the cop is inside a home
[2:49:44.520 --> 2:49:47.480]  the aclu sees nothing in the pilot program
[2:49:47.480 --> 2:49:51.400]  that limits the scope of the police search and that bowls over those who
[2:49:51.400 --> 2:49:55.480]  think consent to search is licensed to trample over the constitution
[2:49:55.480 --> 2:49:59.240]  you want your own house searched
[2:49:59.880 --> 2:50:04.840]  that's a concept i'd have to that's a new one on me
[2:50:04.840 --> 2:50:08.840]  now consent to search goes before the full council on tuesday
[2:50:08.840 --> 2:50:14.120]  if it passes stop right there john you misunderstood me i it's a dc piece
[2:50:14.120 --> 2:50:17.480]  that was a pretty good one too it's a dc piece
[2:50:17.480 --> 2:50:21.800]  with the police saying they don't like it and it's unconstitutional
[2:50:21.800 --> 2:50:26.360]  it doesn't matter the point is this is the united states not soviet russia
[2:50:26.360 --> 2:50:31.000]  or nazi germany and this is all about them getting in your house and setting
[2:50:31.000 --> 2:50:35.320]  a precedent to come and confiscate your guns it's here they tripled the size of
[2:50:35.320 --> 2:50:41.720]  the batf they're not playing games we'll come back
[2:50:41.720 --> 2:50:47.880]  get more into this and a bunch of other key issues
