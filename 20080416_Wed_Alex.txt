[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:01.630]  We're good to go.
[00:00:31.483 --> 00:00:39.369]  I talked some about this yesterday on the broadcast, but I didn't spend as much time on it as I wanted to.
[00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:57.463]  So early in this first hour today, I want to spend some time on this Wednesday edition, the 16th day of April 2008, on a cover story in the local paper here in Austin, Texas, headlined, Everything Must Go.
[00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:03.871]  And it shows a picture of the Constitution being ripped in half and burned.
[00:01:03.871 --> 00:01:09.193]  And it says, you can look behind the Constitution as it's being removed as the evil terrorist.
[00:01:09.193 --> 00:01:11.875]  It says, how to fight terrorism.
[00:01:11.875 --> 00:01:18.958]  So the image is, as they burn away the Constitution, that helps them fight terrorism.
[00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:20.678]  And it says, everything must go.
[00:01:20.678 --> 00:01:26.321]  And they go on to say, and it's a positive article, endorsing getting rid of the Bill of Rights Constitution,
[00:01:27.874 --> 00:01:37.976]  And handing full control over to global corporations, and that the people will be represented through non-governmental organizations that themselves are funded by the corporations.
[00:01:37.976 --> 00:01:44.858]  This is a manifesto of open, complete tyranny.
[00:01:44.858 --> 00:01:55.400]  But if you read the Council on Foreign Relations documents, or you see what the CIA is up to, I mean, they always wrap themselves in the flags, but these people hate this country.
[00:01:56.252 --> 00:01:59.474]  And they hate sovereignty.
[00:01:59.474 --> 00:02:06.097]  And they love using this nation as their bulldog to go out and attack innocent, defenseless countries.
[00:02:06.097 --> 00:02:10.879]  But this is a Bilderberg Group CFR member who we've covered before.
[00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:15.541]  And he, in the past, has headed up the LBJ School of Public Affairs.
[00:02:15.541 --> 00:02:22.004]  He's a big law professor as well at another university.
[00:02:22.004 --> 00:02:23.885]  And I just, I'm just so sick of these people.
[00:02:25.652 --> 00:02:31.013]  I mean, they are criminals, they are traitors, they are treasonous, and I mean those words.
[00:02:31.013 --> 00:02:42.775]  When you are calling for the government to abolish the Bill of Rights Constitution and for there to be no liberty or freedom, you are a treasonous piece of trash.
[00:02:42.775 --> 00:02:52.277]  I mean, you can, as a citizen, you can call for this to be Nazi Germany if you want, or you can call for this to be Mexico if you want.
[00:02:52.277 --> 00:02:54.297]  Though those are distasteful things,
[00:02:55.493 --> 00:03:10.200]  Still, you have a right to do it, but when you are in governmental and quasi-governmental positions, and you preach this type of sedition, I just want these people to get out of this country.
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.760]  But they won't.
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:19.725]  They're parasites, they're in control, and they put out one brand of propaganda for the general public, and then they put another brand of propaganda for the intellectuals, but this is a
[00:03:21.724 --> 00:03:32.752]  Throwing down on the gauntlet, a slapping in the face, a punching us in the face repeatedly, with extreme pleasure.
[00:03:32.752 --> 00:03:37.536]  And I, for one, have just had enough of it.
[00:03:37.536 --> 00:03:44.761]  I, for one, just am... Frankly, I feel weak.
[00:03:44.761 --> 00:03:47.903]  I feel pathetic.
[00:03:47.903 --> 00:03:49.965]  I feel like I'm living in a nightmare.
[00:03:51.206 --> 00:03:53.787]  I mean, I know that I have power, personally.
[00:03:53.787 --> 00:03:56.368]  I know all of us have the spirit of the universe in us.
[00:03:56.368 --> 00:03:59.728]  I know we're wonderful, beautiful creatures.
[00:03:59.728 --> 00:04:04.230]  But at the same time, that makes it even more frustrating because I know we could turn things around.
[00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.691]  We could take things back from these people.
[00:04:06.691 --> 00:04:08.351]  But so many individuals that make $100,000, $200,000, $300,000, $400,000 a year,
[00:04:12.697 --> 00:04:21.881]  Millions of Americans, they think they're part of the system, and they've learned how to kiss hind end, and serve the system, and they don't really know what they're serving.
[00:04:21.881 --> 00:04:27.223]  Most of them are nice people, but they empower this beast.
[00:04:27.223 --> 00:04:34.626]  A beast that's carrying out eugenics against them and their families at point-blank range.
[00:04:34.626 --> 00:04:40.129]  So, we'll break this down, we'll get into a bunch of financial news, serious developments there.
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.421]  We will, uh, get into a bunch of other world news.
[00:04:46.421 --> 00:04:48.382]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:04:48.382 --> 00:04:49.362]  Israel's saying the U.S.
[00:04:49.362 --> 00:04:52.823]  is getting ready to attack Iran.
[00:04:52.823 --> 00:04:54.243]  It is a big idea.
[00:04:54.243 --> 00:04:57.064]  A new world order.
[00:04:57.064 --> 00:05:01.965]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:05:01.965 --> 00:05:04.785]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:05:04.785 --> 00:05:06.946]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:05:07.588 --> 00:05:10.753]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:05:10.753 --> 00:05:18.084]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:21.104 --> 00:05:26.548]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:05:26.548 --> 00:05:30.430]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.992]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:05:32.992 --> 00:05:34.153]  Most people have no idea.
[00:05:34.153 --> 00:05:34.953]  They're not after money.
[00:05:34.953 --> 00:05:36.214]  They have all the money they need.
[00:05:36.214 --> 00:05:37.195]  They're after power.
[00:05:37.195 --> 00:05:38.356]  That's what they're after these years.
[00:05:38.356 --> 00:05:47.061]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[00:05:49.883 --> 00:05:50.964]  You have been warned.
[00:05:51.984 --> 00:05:56.506]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[00:05:56.506 --> 00:06:01.608]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:06:01.608 --> 00:06:03.108]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:06:03.108 --> 00:06:06.730]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[00:06:51.687 --> 00:06:52.147]  Fact.
[00:06:52.147 --> 00:06:58.172]  Rapid industrialization has resulted in environmental pollution and its curse on world health is staggering.
[00:06:58.172 --> 00:07:02.495]  We live in a toxic world that is bombarded by seven new chemicals each day.
[00:07:02.495 --> 00:07:10.181]  The human body is amazing and efficient in design, but because of the polluted world in which we live, is unable to remove all toxins.
[00:07:10.181 --> 00:07:10.922]  The solution.
[00:07:10.922 --> 00:07:15.145]  Detoxification integrated with the LectroChi Premier Energy Foot Spa.
[00:07:15.145 --> 00:07:17.127]  The LectroChi Premier Energy Foot Spa.
[00:07:17.227 --> 00:07:17.487]  I think so.
[00:07:37.156 --> 00:07:39.939]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:19.402 --> 00:08:22.243]  Thank you for joining us today.
[00:08:22.243 --> 00:08:30.929]  We've got a guest coming up in about 20 minutes who's going to discuss how the Democratic Convention is going to be held this year.
[00:08:34.068 --> 00:08:47.737]  They are not allowing anybody to demonstrate unless they authorize it, and then hundreds of groups go and put in for a lottery, and then one group is allowed to demonstrate in a small pen.
[00:08:47.737 --> 00:08:56.504]  Now, that's the opposite of the First Amendment, that's the opposite of the United States and our entire heritage and our law, but it doesn't matter.
[00:08:56.504 --> 00:09:01.287]  Major states are announcing there's no more Fourth Amendment, and they'll spy on whoever they want without warrants, too.
[00:09:02.518 --> 00:09:05.259]  It's just wall-to-wall government lawlessness.
[00:09:05.259 --> 00:09:20.366]  I went and paid the supposed income taxes to the private Federal Reserve yesterday and violated my own Fifth Amendment right, incriminating myself, and a tax code designed so they can selectively enforce on whoever they wish.
[00:09:20.366 --> 00:09:30.270]  And then I was at a meeting last night at about 10 o'clock and I was driving downtown and I was in traffic that was moving slowly across the Congress Bridge
[00:09:31.038 --> 00:09:36.081]  That is a 35 mile an hour speed limit and a cop pulls me over and he says, uh, didn't you see me behind you?
[00:09:36.081 --> 00:09:36.661]  And I said, no.
[00:09:36.661 --> 00:09:38.722]  He goes, well, you were speeding.
[00:09:38.722 --> 00:09:42.945]  And, uh, I kind of analyzed that in my head and I looked at him and I said, really?
[00:09:42.945 --> 00:09:45.386]  I was speeding.
[00:09:45.386 --> 00:09:46.467]  I was speeding.
[00:09:46.467 --> 00:09:54.071]  And, uh, I had some, uh, friends who were traveling behind me and they had noticed the cop.
[00:09:54.071 --> 00:09:54.451]  I hadn't.
[00:09:55.442 --> 00:10:01.606]  And I had pulled up beside him and saw him behind me, basically, you know, running people's plates, probably mine.
[00:10:01.606 --> 00:10:20.599]  And I guess that's the fun game, is to just... And he had his light shining at my car, but I did get a decent look at it, and I believe the issue was he had, and I know some of the Austin Cruisers have this, Houston has it, Dallas has it, Austin has a few.
[00:10:21.863 --> 00:10:22.183]  I don't know.
[00:10:22.183 --> 00:10:24.345]  I saw when they were testing five of them a few years ago.
[00:10:24.345 --> 00:10:27.368]  I'm sure they've got more now.
[00:10:27.368 --> 00:10:29.149]  They always buy more.
[00:10:29.149 --> 00:10:32.452]  Where it just reads everybody's license plates as it drives down the road.
[00:10:32.452 --> 00:10:34.514]  And I guess it was fun to pull over Alex Jones.
[00:10:34.514 --> 00:10:39.598]  I said, how much was I speeding?
[00:10:39.598 --> 00:10:41.980]  Oh, five miles over the speed limit.
[00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:42.581]  That's right.
[00:10:42.581 --> 00:10:44.122]  Now it's five miles over.
[00:10:44.122 --> 00:10:46.744]  You see, in the past it was five, six miles over.
[00:10:46.744 --> 00:10:47.425]  They don't pull you over.
[00:10:48.451 --> 00:10:52.654]  Pretty soon, if you're one mile over the speed limit, there'll probably be a $50,000 fine.
[00:10:52.654 --> 00:10:54.716]  You'll probably go to Guantanamo Bay.
[00:10:54.716 --> 00:10:57.418]  But illegal aliens can be drinking and driving.
[00:10:57.418 --> 00:11:01.681]  Illegal aliens can get free health care.
[00:11:01.681 --> 00:11:03.803]  Citizens don't.
[00:11:03.803 --> 00:11:05.664]  But the corporations are above the law, too.
[00:11:05.664 --> 00:11:12.109]  There was an AP article yesterday admitting that big corporations don't really get audited and don't pay much taxes anymore.
[00:11:13.063 --> 00:11:14.144]  In fact, I meant to cover that.
[00:11:14.144 --> 00:11:17.226]  It was in the stack yesterday, but it's just all selectively enforced.
[00:11:17.226 --> 00:11:20.268]  That's how everything works now today.
[00:11:20.268 --> 00:11:26.171]  I saw a nice fellow on my Myspace saying, hey Alex, stop bashing the brainwashed Mexicans.
[00:11:26.171 --> 00:11:29.774]  It makes us tough on us Mexicans.
[00:11:29.774 --> 00:11:32.175]  You know, I'm not against Mexicans.
[00:11:32.175 --> 00:11:34.096]  I like Mexicans.
[00:11:34.096 --> 00:11:36.458]  They like me.
[00:11:36.458 --> 00:11:41.381]  I'm not into what color people are, but I am into the fact that a lot of people that are different colors from me don't like me.
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:45.402]  And I'm sure that you're a different color from whites, so you don't like it.
[00:11:45.402 --> 00:11:51.506]  A lot of whites don't like you, and I make no bones about the fact there are a lot of whites that don't like you for your skin color.
[00:11:51.506 --> 00:11:53.607]  I think that's wrong.
[00:11:53.607 --> 00:12:08.577]  I'm just saying, if illegal aliens and foreigners and immigrants get more tuition than citizens, more health care than citizens, more welfare than citizens, are above the law, don't have to have insurance,
[00:12:10.956 --> 00:12:15.519]  I also showed him, I said, oh, I don't have my new insurance card, because you get one every six months for some reason.
[00:12:15.519 --> 00:12:18.341]  I don't know why that happens from Allstate.
[00:12:18.341 --> 00:12:23.084]  But I said, oh, look, it was expired by a month.
[00:12:23.084 --> 00:12:24.685]  And he said, well, I'm going to give you a ticket for that, too.
[00:12:24.685 --> 00:12:27.107]  And I had a whole bunch of expired ones in the glove compartment.
[00:12:27.107 --> 00:12:28.388]  I said, yeah.
[00:12:28.388 --> 00:12:29.728]  I said, go ahead.
[00:12:29.728 --> 00:12:33.871]  He said, you can just go down to the court, and there's a little fee or something.
[00:12:33.871 --> 00:12:34.992]  Or I pointed out there's a fee.
[00:12:34.992 --> 00:12:36.513]  And he said, yeah, you just go down to the court.
[00:12:37.779 --> 00:12:43.163]  And so, you know, it's not enough to pay the private bankers that own me and my family, and they pretty much do.
[00:12:43.163 --> 00:12:47.126]  I mean, I can say consciously that they don't own me, but they physically do.
[00:12:47.126 --> 00:12:52.670]  They have paramilitary forces that they can snap their fingers and they'll kill me and my family in ten seconds.
[00:12:52.670 --> 00:13:02.197]  They'll kill you, they'll put poison in your water, they'll put poison in your vaccines, they'll spray you, they'll do what they want, when they want, how they want.
[00:13:02.197 --> 00:13:05.079]  And I don't even want to say I feel impotent.
[00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:09.953]  But I feel borderline impotence, the word.
[00:13:09.953 --> 00:13:16.899]  I know we're making big in-rows, we're exposing these people, and their system is being discredited, but they just say, we don't care.
[00:13:16.899 --> 00:13:23.265]  By the way, we're gonna hire another million cops, and get rid of posse commentatus, and we're building FEMA camps.
[00:13:23.265 --> 00:13:25.027]  And that's really what it comes down to.
[00:13:25.027 --> 00:13:32.434]  We have criminals that have the high ground, with brainwashed minions serving them, who have no idea what they're part of, and, uh, we're in a lot of trouble.
[00:13:34.994 --> 00:13:49.461]  You know, there's a big story out about aboriginal children in Australia being injected with leprosy, watered-down leprosy, quote, as a treatment until the 1960s.
[00:13:49.461 --> 00:13:59.065]  And people are whitewashing it and saying, well, it killed some of them and made some of them sick, the aborigines.
[00:14:00.544 --> 00:14:08.107]  Then they defend in the articles that, well, CPS took the children from all aboriginal families to indoctrinate them.
[00:14:08.107 --> 00:14:10.528]  It says to bring them into society.
[00:14:10.528 --> 00:14:15.650]  Kind of like when they say in California, the state court has ruled homeschooling's illegal.
[00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:17.671]  Did that a month and a half ago.
[00:14:17.671 --> 00:14:22.573]  And they said in the ruling, they said it's, you need to be, you know, you know what?
[00:14:22.573 --> 00:14:24.154]  I shouldn't just talk about something like that.
[00:14:24.154 --> 00:14:24.374]  I should
[00:14:27.113 --> 00:14:28.594]  It's in the bottom of the stack here.
[00:14:28.594 --> 00:14:30.716]  Let me just find that and go ahead and cover that now.
[00:14:30.716 --> 00:14:33.398]  I want to use the exact term.
[00:14:33.398 --> 00:14:35.240]  Here it is, BBC.
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:37.722]  Aborigines using experiments.
[00:14:37.722 --> 00:14:42.445]  Some Aboriginal children in Australia were once used for medical tests, it has been claimed.
[00:14:42.445 --> 00:14:52.934]  And then it says, well, it is, they go on to admit that, well, yeah, the medical records show they took them and did experiments on them, but it was reported like maybe it's a good job.
[00:14:54.309 --> 00:14:59.993]  It says, from the 19th century to the late 60s, many aboriginal children were taken from their parents.
[00:14:59.993 --> 00:15:03.036]  The info I've got is in many areas of the country, all of them were taken.
[00:15:03.036 --> 00:15:05.818]  There are a few areas where they didn't take all of them.
[00:15:05.818 --> 00:15:11.022]  And brought up by white families in an attempt at the government to assimilate the indigenous population.
[00:15:11.022 --> 00:15:12.403]  Assimilate!
[00:15:12.403 --> 00:15:15.525]  And that's what they say in the court ruling in California.
[00:15:15.525 --> 00:15:22.010]  They said, well, it's all part of assimilation, and all part of, um... Oh, what's the term they use?
[00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:23.091]  It's right on the tip of my tongue.
[00:15:24.128 --> 00:15:53.346]  uh... assimilation and the other term is uh... oh it's the one they always use when they say that they're taking people's homeschoolers kids or christians children or rural peoples or Appalachian children poor white children whenever they're taking them usually using them for medical experiments too it is their favorite or poor black children uh... they say that they uh... need the interaction with other children uh... uh... the term will pop somebody will call in with the term but
[00:15:54.565 --> 00:15:55.845]  It's similar to this.
[00:15:55.845 --> 00:16:01.587]  You know, we the state, we know best.
[00:16:01.587 --> 00:16:20.051]  And if you want to profile the social workers... You know, when I say that the CPS workers, that a lot of them are pedophiles, that's because every day, and we're not even looking for this news, we see it and
[00:16:20.649 --> 00:16:49.438]  Texas, New York, Florida, every state where some head CPS individual or someone running a a foster home or uh... the the truancy officer or the cop or the principal or the teacher but uh... well i mean the federal statistics are five times more likely for a child to be abused the number one most dangerous place for a child is government custody state custody you can pull that uh...
[00:16:50.103 --> 00:16:51.764]  Federal numbers up, if you want it.
[00:16:51.764 --> 00:16:53.786]  Department of Health and Human Services.
[00:16:53.786 --> 00:16:56.768]  And it's been on the cover of Time Magazine and things.
[00:16:56.768 --> 00:17:02.913]  One issue was the shame of foster care, with a little black kid on the front, beat half to death.
[00:17:02.913 --> 00:17:15.723]  But, uh, when you read this article, the main issue is, is that they kidnapped the children, and sent them to facilities and, uh, other families, who basically used them on farms and ranches as slave labor.
[00:17:15.723 --> 00:17:19.506]  See, there's a lot of slavery, uh, we think of blacks,
[00:17:20.202 --> 00:17:26.247]  With yokes around their neck, like a mule pulling a plow in a cotton field.
[00:17:26.247 --> 00:17:28.369]  And certainly that went on here.
[00:17:28.369 --> 00:17:33.233]  But most slavery is indentured type, or sharecropper type.
[00:17:33.233 --> 00:17:42.360]  Where you live in a shack, and it's not even the job legally of master to make sure you've got enough food to eat or medicine.
[00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:45.903]  You could get in trouble if you didn't take care of your black slaves.
[00:17:45.903 --> 00:17:49.146]  But if you were the poor whites or others, or freed blacks,
[00:17:49.821 --> 00:17:53.223]  Nobody took care of you and you were just basically slaves on the property.
[00:17:53.223 --> 00:17:54.824]  And that's what the globalists want.
[00:17:54.824 --> 00:17:56.305]  That's what they need.
[00:17:56.305 --> 00:17:58.266]  That's what they're pushing for.
[00:17:58.266 --> 00:18:02.768]  That's what they are creating.
[00:18:02.768 --> 00:18:10.452]  And so, hidden in plain view, right here in this article, is the real issue.
[00:18:10.452 --> 00:18:17.016]  And by the way, I remember more than ten years ago reading about them giving them leprosy.
[00:18:18.423 --> 00:18:22.304]  And testing vaccines on them, and all sorts of things.
[00:18:22.304 --> 00:18:30.246]  So, you know, this new thing about a controversial, dangerous leprosy treatment, you know, which was a, again, watered-down version of leprosy, you know, did it?
[00:18:30.246 --> 00:18:31.166]  Was it abusive?
[00:18:31.166 --> 00:18:34.367]  Well, the point is they took their kids away.
[00:18:34.367 --> 00:18:45.790]  And, you know, I point a lot to what was in the New York Daily News and a few other papers a few years back, where, because it described it, and this was good CPS workers that did tell the truth.
[00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:47.010]  Because they're not all pedophiles.
[00:18:47.757 --> 00:19:06.726]  The rest of them were, because I went to college with them, I remember talking to people that were going to school to be CPS workers, and then I bumped into, socially, these people before, and they'll always get this weird, far-off look in their eyes, and they'll say, you know, I was abused when I was a child.
[00:19:06.726 --> 00:19:13.129]  My father did this and that to me, and put cigarettes out on me, and beat me, and I'm not gonna let that continue to happen.
[00:19:13.129 --> 00:19:14.930]  I'm gonna go out and fight these people.
[00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:17.371]  And they get this far-off look and start talking about their dad or mom,
[00:19:18.576 --> 00:19:20.878]  And they literally are mentally scarred.
[00:19:20.878 --> 00:19:23.961]  They shouldn't be out doing this.
[00:19:23.961 --> 00:19:27.303]  And so they think everybody's an abuser.
[00:19:27.303 --> 00:19:29.785]  And it's like, I'm taking your children.
[00:19:29.785 --> 00:19:31.747]  You look like my father.
[00:19:31.747 --> 00:19:33.668]  You've got dirty dishes.
[00:19:33.668 --> 00:19:35.230]  You're bad.
[00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:39.853]  So it's an abuse cult.
[00:19:39.853 --> 00:19:41.855]  So, I don't know.
[00:19:41.855 --> 00:19:43.356]  We've got a bunch of financial news we'll get to.
[00:19:43.356 --> 00:19:46.779]  We'll get to this call for getting rid of the Constitution.
[00:19:47.501 --> 00:19:53.446]  And a lot more on the other side, too.
[00:19:53.446 --> 00:19:56.148]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:19:56.148 --> 00:20:05.596]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:05.596 --> 00:20:12.702]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:13.422 --> 00:20:19.407]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:20:19.407 --> 00:20:30.196]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:20:30.976 --> 00:20:31.537]  It is a big idea.
[00:20:54.986 --> 00:20:56.747]  A New World Order.
[00:20:56.747 --> 00:21:01.269]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[00:21:01.269 --> 00:21:04.490]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:07.271]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:21:07.271 --> 00:21:10.453]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:21:10.453 --> 00:21:17.776]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:21:20.798 --> 00:21:26.240]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:30.121]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:21:30.121 --> 00:21:32.682]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:21:32.682 --> 00:21:33.842]  Most people have no idea.
[00:21:33.842 --> 00:21:34.623]  They're not after money.
[00:21:34.623 --> 00:21:35.903]  They have all the money they need.
[00:21:35.903 --> 00:21:36.903]  They're after power.
[00:21:36.903 --> 00:21:38.024]  That's what they're after.

[00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:56.892]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[00:21:56.892 --> 00:22:01.874]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[00:22:01.874 --> 00:22:04.756]  Very few consumers even know such products exist.
[00:22:04.756 --> 00:22:09.538]  SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing that the major oil companies have run.
[00:22:09.818 --> 00:22:10.058]  Yes, sir.

[00:23:58.597 --> 00:24:01.779]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:01.779 --> 00:24:05.702]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[00:24:05.702 --> 00:24:10.345]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[00:24:10.345 --> 00:24:18.190]  And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire, the ring of fire.
[00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:20.292]  And it burns, burns, burns,
[00:24:21.663 --> 00:24:26.165]  Paul Watson has done an incredible job at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:24:26.165 --> 00:24:38.752]  Neocon calls for shredding Constitution, imposing world government, and of course he poses as a neolib, is what he calls himself, but it's the same thing as a neocon.
[00:24:38.752 --> 00:24:40.393]  Two sides of the same coin.
[00:24:40.393 --> 00:24:44.455]  A malcontent response to Philip Bobbitt's call to end America.
[00:24:44.455 --> 00:24:46.316]  And they call for it.
[00:24:46.316 --> 00:24:50.918]  I mean, they show a picture of the Constitution being burned, they say it's good, and they say everything must go.
[00:24:52.364 --> 00:24:54.906]  And that's what they do on the front page of the paper where I live.
[00:24:54.906 --> 00:24:57.988]  They just celebrate the death of this country.
[00:24:57.988 --> 00:25:05.533]  And they just sit up there in their little armored university fortresses, guarded by their men in black uniforms, and urinate all over us.
[00:25:05.533 --> 00:25:12.077]  And I've just had enough of these people.
[00:25:12.077 --> 00:25:20.043]  In fact, every time I read the quotes and look at the picture of the Constitution being burned, I get so mad that I
[00:25:22.116 --> 00:25:23.257]  It's just so over the top!
[00:25:23.257 --> 00:25:24.618]  They're the enemy!
[00:25:24.618 --> 00:25:27.861]  They're declared enemies of this country!
[00:25:27.861 --> 00:25:40.932]  And everybody kisses their hind end, everybody worships them, and grovels to them, and they just feed on us, and suck off of us, and... Let me tell you something.
[00:25:40.932 --> 00:25:49.760]  They beta-tested taking people's kids, and testing drugs on them, and... Everything on the blacks, and the Mexicans, and the Asians.
[00:25:51.738 --> 00:25:57.741]  In this country, and in other nations, on whatever the minority group is.
[00:25:57.741 --> 00:26:00.903]  But their real target is everybody.
[00:26:00.903 --> 00:26:04.845]  And you need to understand that, that we're all being attacked, we're all going through this.
[00:26:04.845 --> 00:26:11.829]  And I never finished talking about New York City, what had been admitted in New York.
[00:26:11.829 --> 00:26:15.091]  You can pull it up, foster children, you know, drugs tested on them.
[00:26:15.091 --> 00:26:20.754]  Most articles you find are the whitewash about how kids that didn't even have AIDS, well first you'll find articles, hundreds of them,
[00:26:23.117 --> 00:26:25.338]  They kind of smokescreen it with the lesser evil.
[00:26:25.338 --> 00:26:27.319]  That's one of their favorite tactics.
[00:26:27.319 --> 00:26:38.425]  Well, they take kids that had AIDS or HIV and test experimental, highly toxic drugs that are basically chemotherapies on them and how some of them got sick and died.
[00:26:38.425 --> 00:26:49.951]  And then you read deeper and you'll find in a few news articles out of New York and in the police reports and others and advocacy groups that have the documents posted on their sites and
[00:26:50.678 --> 00:26:55.961]  That, no no no, it was children that didn't have HIV they'd test the drugs on and they'd die.
[00:26:55.961 --> 00:27:08.369]  And then you find out that thousands of children in New York City alone, in the last decade, would have pesticides tested on them till they die.
[00:27:08.369 --> 00:27:12.612]  And I remember crying on air, I can't help it, I broke down one day.
[00:27:12.612 --> 00:27:15.594]  Because I was reading a New York Daily News article, this was about three years ago,
[00:27:19.017 --> 00:27:26.264]  And it talked about this little eight-year-old black boy, and it gave his name, and a CPS worker went public with this.
[00:27:26.264 --> 00:27:27.265]  It's the only reason it came out.
[00:27:27.265 --> 00:27:31.549]  And then the article, though, kind of debated whether it was okay, which was amazing.
[00:27:31.549 --> 00:27:35.273]  And then it said that they went to the black mother, and they said, we're going to take your two-year-old.
[00:27:35.273 --> 00:27:39.216]  If you don't give us the eight-year-old, we've decided your house isn't safe.
[00:27:39.216 --> 00:27:41.839]  Just sign him over and agree.
[00:27:41.839 --> 00:27:42.880]  The mother, of course, didn't know.
[00:27:44.508 --> 00:27:45.569]  It's false consent.
[00:27:45.569 --> 00:27:47.910]  They intimidate you into it and say, well you consented.
[00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:50.672]  It's a little lawyer trick.
[00:27:50.672 --> 00:28:05.801]  And it said they took the little black boy and then for the next two months gave him dosages and first he could walk and they had him in a cell and then he had to be in a bed and then he couldn't talk and then they gave him pesticide until he died.
[00:28:05.801 --> 00:28:06.922]  That's just one person.
[00:28:09.565 --> 00:28:19.247]  Gave him pesticide till he died, and he was taken to a government slash private pharma facility where they test on foster children.
[00:28:19.247 --> 00:28:25.329]  I mean, just, you kill little kids?
[00:28:25.329 --> 00:28:30.670]  And nobody can go to jail for that, but you can pull me over for going five miles over the speed limit.
[00:28:30.670 --> 00:28:32.491]  Can't you, cops?
[00:28:32.491 --> 00:28:33.031]  Yeah, you can.
[00:28:33.962 --> 00:28:35.043]  And you'll probably win.
[00:28:35.043 --> 00:28:37.404]  You'll probably kill me, or put me in prison.
[00:28:37.404 --> 00:28:39.105]  You always win, don't you?
[00:28:39.105 --> 00:28:41.046]  You always get to kill the little kids.
[00:28:41.046 --> 00:28:44.788]  You always get to urinate all over the rest of us.
[00:28:44.788 --> 00:28:58.997]  You just get to keep winning, and winning, and winning, and winning, and winning, and winning, and winning, and winning, because the general public are a bunch of softies who have no idea how the world works.
[00:28:58.997 --> 00:29:00.778]  You know, last night I was in a really bad mood.
[00:29:01.778 --> 00:29:13.005]  Because I was just, it's 7 o'clock at night, just trying to finish my taxes that I pay to the Federal Reserve, the mafia payment I make.
[00:29:13.005 --> 00:29:14.546]  Of course, it's not legal or real.
[00:29:14.546 --> 00:29:19.670]  Of course, it goes to private banks, but, you know, I choose my battles.
[00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:21.651]  And I was kind of throwing a fit.
[00:29:21.651 --> 00:29:24.133]  I was actually stomping around cussing.
[00:29:24.133 --> 00:29:26.414]  And I'm not normally like this in private.
[00:29:26.414 --> 00:29:27.715]  It's beginning to overtake me.
[00:29:28.539 --> 00:29:33.742]  And my dad said something to me that stopped me in my tracks, and I'm gonna tell you the story when we get back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:33.742 --> 00:29:36.984]  Then we're gonna talk to a guest about how they stage events.
[00:29:36.984 --> 00:29:38.145]  It just makes me sick.
[00:29:38.145 --> 00:29:42.828]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:42.828 --> 00:29:44.209]  We're on the march.
[00:29:44.209 --> 00:29:46.751]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:46.751 --> 00:29:53.435]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:53.435 --> 00:29:54.596]  I'm Dr. Bill Deagle, M.D.
[00:29:54.596 --> 00:29:56.697]  I'm the Director of Medical Report here on Genesis.
[00:29:57.122 --> 00:30:00.164]  Allison's Natural Antibiotic from Allomax Nutraceuticals U.S.
[00:30:00.164 --> 00:30:00.905]  is the real thing.
[00:30:00.905 --> 00:30:07.909]  This amazing molecule is a stabilized antimicrobial, antipathogenic killer for fresh, never-before-available garlic.
[00:30:07.909 --> 00:30:18.937]  Allison molecule is biologically active against all bacterial pathogens, viruses, fungi, parasites, TB, and it kills fleshy bacteria, MRSA, Acinetobacter infections that ravage our everyday health.
[00:30:18.937 --> 00:30:26.882]  Taken daily, it removes these stealth pathogens, clearing our bodies of disease activators that cause chronic health issues and means a much higher level of wellness for you.
[00:30:27.022 --> 00:30:27.783]  I think so.
[00:30:52.697 --> 00:30:57.780]  You can trace every disease, every illness, and every ailment to mineral deficiency.
[00:30:57.780 --> 00:31:01.663]  That is a quote from two-time Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling.
[00:31:01.663 --> 00:31:11.349]  Because fruits and vegetables in their raw form are better absorbed, retained, and utilized than if heated, the Champion Juicer is the best way to get your nutrients your body craves.
[00:31:11.349 --> 00:31:15.752]  The Champion Juicer chews the fibers and breaks up the cells of vegetables and fruits.
[00:31:15.752 --> 00:31:19.414]  This gives you more fiber, enzymes, vitamins, and trace minerals.
[00:31:19.594 --> 00:31:29.881]  Juicing a combination of raw fruits and vegetables is documented to not only treat minor illness, but also is shown to reverse once thought incurable, life-threatening diseases.
[00:31:29.881 --> 00:31:35.005]  Juicing with the Champion Juicer also promotes fast, healthy weight loss and pure body cleansing.
[00:31:35.005 --> 00:31:37.687]  Put the Champion Juicer to work for you and your family.
[00:31:37.847 --> 00:31:42.528]  Get creative with your juicer and add a grain mill attachment to make your own healthy, fresh flour.
[00:31:42.528 --> 00:31:46.770]  The Champion Juicer also makes great nut butters and frozen sorbets.
[00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:49.450]  The world's finest juicer is Champion Juicer.

[00:33:01.237 --> 00:33:26.965]  They railed against the crown Another ragtag band Declaring independence They laid their bodies down On a bloody wall And liberty for their descendants Thanks to the renegades
[00:33:30.916 --> 00:33:37.638]  Okay, so I had a CPA work on the taxes of the private Federal Reserve to the mafia that owns the country.
[00:33:37.638 --> 00:33:40.999]  And that's not a... Hyperbole.
[00:33:40.999 --> 00:33:42.940]  That's really who you pay your taxes to.
[00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:46.001]  I'm not just calling them a private crime syndicate.
[00:33:46.001 --> 00:33:48.782]  I mean, that's who runs and rules us all.
[00:33:48.782 --> 00:33:52.443]  We're property of... I guess, better men.
[00:33:52.443 --> 00:33:54.324]  I mean, we're their slaves.
[00:33:54.324 --> 00:33:57.185]  We could try to revolt against them in the Info War, but...
[00:33:59.212 --> 00:34:27.337]  You know, the CPA had, and with data importing, and there were some mistakes, and we had to fix it, and then they didn't have time to certify it, so I was filing an extension, and I'm just sitting there grumbling and griping about it, and my dad was helping me after he got off work, and he said, look, his uncle, his dad's brother, who my dad's attached to, I like him too, Uncle Leonard,
[00:34:29.195 --> 00:34:37.600]  All of a sudden was in excruciating pain and had all these blockages in between his liver and gallbladder and a bunch of other things.
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:40.662]  And they found out he had a big tumor in there, a cancer.
[00:34:40.662 --> 00:34:44.105]  So he had to have this emergency surgery.
[00:34:44.105 --> 00:34:46.166]  So my dad drove down there a few days ago.
[00:34:46.166 --> 00:34:51.169]  And he came out of the seven hour surgery okay, thank God.
[00:34:51.169 --> 00:34:57.033]  And my dad is sitting there for a day and he said that there was this nice good looking
[00:34:57.791 --> 00:35:04.153]  Young professional family sitting out there and they looked really, really sad.
[00:35:04.153 --> 00:35:19.097]  And then my dad was sitting right next to him and he had to watch the doctor come out in the waiting room and say, well, your four year old has an operable brain tumor and will be dead in four weeks.
[00:35:19.097 --> 00:35:24.618]  And then he sat there listening to how they love this little boy so much and how he'd grown up.
[00:35:25.236 --> 00:35:35.640]  And he ran around and played and was so happy and everybody loved him and he just, you know, had just that magic love of life in him.
[00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:45.464]  And then he started bumping into things and falling down and then he couldn't even go to the bathroom and, you know, by then they pretty much knew something was wrong and they took him in and it was a brain tumor.
[00:35:45.464 --> 00:35:46.465]  You know, fast growing.
[00:35:46.465 --> 00:35:49.026]  This just happened in a few weeks.
[00:35:49.026 --> 00:35:52.707]  So, you know what?
[00:35:52.707 --> 00:35:54.288]  The world is filled with a lot of pain.
[00:35:56.551 --> 00:36:07.040]  And a lot of bad things are happening, a lot of really painful things are going on, and every single one of us better thank God every day.
[00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:15.267]  Thank the Maker every day that we are alive, that we have consciousness, that our children are healthy, that our parents are healthy, or even alive.
[00:36:15.267 --> 00:36:21.672]  You know, these unhappy people that have nice houses, cars, vacations, and they're totally unhappy,
[00:36:22.264 --> 00:36:34.268]  Then you see some poor child in Latin America, or in Africa, or in Asia, or in India, drinking their morning water out of a fetid, sewage-filled river.
[00:36:34.268 --> 00:36:41.810]  And they have just got glowing eyes, and their souls are electrified, and they have these happy smiles on their faces.
[00:36:41.810 --> 00:36:50.933]  Because they haven't had their souls stolen by the television in Madison Avenue, and this decadent culture, and just all the evil that is around us.
[00:36:52.119 --> 00:36:59.044]  I just couldn't imagine my children dying of a brain tumor or being about to die.
[00:36:59.044 --> 00:37:02.987]  And that's why we come on air and speak out against GMO foods.
[00:37:02.987 --> 00:37:19.819]  In every major study, including studies done by the GMO companies, monkeys, guinea pigs, rats, and many other forms of mammals, all get tumors all over their bodies.
[00:37:19.819 --> 00:37:20.420]  They all
[00:37:21.585 --> 00:37:23.086]  End up dying early.
[00:37:23.086 --> 00:37:36.074]  And scientists had previously thought that mutation generally only happened in utero, and then the major deformities that were fast-acting were due to birth defects, were due to genetics.
[00:37:36.074 --> 00:37:50.423]  But now they're finding that these foods can cause not just cancers, but mutations, and mutation to different types of growths while you are even young, you know, before your DNA starts malfunctioning.
[00:37:52.441 --> 00:37:57.826]  Uh, from cell damage, toxins, solar radiation, all of it that breaks up our DNA.
[00:37:57.826 --> 00:37:59.467]  I mean, there's no doubt.
[00:37:59.467 --> 00:38:05.632]  Your children, when they eat GMO food that's chimera-across-species-altered, there's no doubt it's hurting them bad.
[00:38:05.632 --> 00:38:08.554]  You just think everybody's got allergies for nothing?
[00:38:08.554 --> 00:38:20.004]  You think everybody, no matter how much they exercise, still feels like crap for nothing?
[00:38:20.004 --> 00:38:21.265]  And don't think it won't happen to you.
[00:38:23.641 --> 00:38:36.044]  The toxins, the poisons, the things that... Yesterday, Associated Press reported the feds are blocking funding to further investigate why every major water supply has hundreds of drugs and chemicals in it.
[00:38:36.044 --> 00:38:43.425]  And they've also found it's at levels that the scientists are saying shouldn't be from urine.
[00:38:43.425 --> 00:38:47.766]  Shouldn't be from people's waste.
[00:38:47.766 --> 00:38:49.407]  They're finding it at levels much higher.
[00:38:49.407 --> 00:38:50.927]  They're putting the stuff in the water.
[00:38:51.431 --> 00:39:01.260]  Because the things they find that just so happen to be off the charts are the serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:06.385]  I'm not going to sit here and preach anymore.
[00:39:06.385 --> 00:39:09.568]  I'm willing to give up my life.
[00:39:09.568 --> 00:39:11.830]  And this is nothing special.
[00:39:11.830 --> 00:39:14.152]  We have become so sick.
[00:39:14.152 --> 00:39:15.153]  We're about to go to our guest.
[00:39:16.926 --> 00:39:18.347]  I am willing to give up my life.
[00:39:18.347 --> 00:39:36.073]  I mean, if I saw the classic hypothetical ticking time bomb scenario, you know, of a child is about, doesn't see a bus and is about to be hit by it, would I jump out in front of the bus to knock the kid out of the way?
[00:39:36.073 --> 00:39:39.214]  And I can say that I would do that.
[00:39:39.214 --> 00:39:40.034]  I know I would do that.
[00:39:44.537 --> 00:39:47.659]  But it isn't because I am even a good person.
[00:39:47.659 --> 00:39:48.960]  My instincts are intact.
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:51.001]  They have not been removed.
[00:39:51.001 --> 00:39:55.984]  And that's the instinct of what a male, especially, is supposed to do.
[00:39:55.984 --> 00:40:00.407]  I mean, that's why men are tougher and stronger and the guardians of the tribe.
[00:40:00.407 --> 00:40:05.250]  We're here to die in defense of the women and children.
[00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:07.312]  We're here to sacrifice.
[00:40:07.312 --> 00:40:08.292]  We're here to work hard.
[00:40:08.292 --> 00:40:13.436]  And instead, we're a bunch of men who act tough, act studly,
[00:40:14.815 --> 00:40:24.317]  Uh, strut around, bugging their eyes out, uh, but literally cringe and shake when a cop pulls them over.
[00:40:24.317 --> 00:40:26.038]  I've seen it.
[00:40:26.038 --> 00:40:31.799]  But they'll boss their neighbor around and act tough at the mailbox to the, to the runt neighbor, you know.
[00:40:31.799 --> 00:40:35.700]  Uh, you don't care about your kids, you don't care about anything.
[00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:37.980]  You just care about strutting around acting tough.
[00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:41.401]  And it's shameful that you won't be real men.
[00:40:41.401 --> 00:40:42.021]  It's shameful.
[00:40:42.725 --> 00:40:48.787]  That, uh, you think a man being a man is about how many women you can have sex with.
[00:40:48.787 --> 00:40:53.228]  Well, it is in the primitive sense, but then it means taking care of those women and kids.
[00:40:53.228 --> 00:40:55.288]  And, oh, you forgot that part.
[00:40:55.288 --> 00:41:04.610]  And, uh, when people come over the next hill wanting to take what you got, going in there and fighting to the death against them.
[00:41:04.610 --> 00:41:07.911]  And you just have had all that taken away from you.
[00:41:07.911 --> 00:41:08.851]  And you have been gelded.
[00:41:08.851 --> 00:41:09.732]  Okay, I'm gonna shut up.
[00:41:09.732 --> 00:41:10.812]  I appreciate Jonathan
[00:41:11.678 --> 00:41:14.500]  Ellen off for joining us.
[00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:15.801]  He's here to talk about two issues.
[00:41:15.801 --> 00:41:20.164]  They have repeatedly talked to Gary Hart.
[00:41:20.164 --> 00:41:26.028]  And that, of course, is one of the top Council on Foreign Relations strategic planners in the Hart-Rubin Commission.
[00:41:26.028 --> 00:41:28.929]  They wrote the Homeland Security plan years before we were attacked.
[00:41:28.929 --> 00:41:30.050]  They said we'd be attacked.
[00:41:30.050 --> 00:41:36.755]  They said use this disaster to create a new world order.
[00:41:36.755 --> 00:41:38.115]  And he also wrote a letter to
[00:41:41.792 --> 00:41:45.395]  He wrote a letter to Iran last year saying, the U.S.
[00:41:45.395 --> 00:41:49.999]  government stages terror attacks and we'll stage one again, you better do what we say.
[00:41:49.999 --> 00:41:53.721]  Don't think because 80% of the public are against attacking you that we won't do it.
[00:41:53.721 --> 00:41:54.542]  We stage events.
[00:41:54.542 --> 00:41:56.344]  And he went through listing them.
[00:41:56.344 --> 00:41:59.386]  I mean, these guys are just out in the open.
[00:41:59.386 --> 00:42:04.090]  But then when you raise these points, they just deny it.
[00:42:04.090 --> 00:42:07.853]  Kind of like if you went and confronted Professor Bobbitt, the fellow at UT,
[00:42:09.835 --> 00:42:12.658]  Involved in NSA, everything else you can imagine.
[00:42:12.658 --> 00:42:18.463]  University of Texas Senior Fellow, Philip Bobbitt.
[00:42:18.463 --> 00:42:22.406]  If you go and you talk to him, he would just deny all the things.
[00:42:22.406 --> 00:42:25.589]  But in the paper, they said everything must go, get rid of the Constitution.
[00:42:25.589 --> 00:42:28.452]  And then put a picture of the Constitution burning and said it was a good thing.
[00:42:29.645 --> 00:42:31.986]  But that's an enemy operation.
[00:42:31.986 --> 00:42:32.727]  That's understood.
[00:42:32.727 --> 00:42:45.533]  They're a soldier sneaking up on your position, and if you walk over to them in camouflage in the rice paddy and say, are you a soldier with an AK-47 that's gonna sneak up to my foxhole and throw a hand grenade in?
[00:42:45.533 --> 00:42:47.274]  They'll say, uh, no, I'm not.
[00:42:47.274 --> 00:42:54.437]  And then you'll go, oh, well, thank you, and then just keep, wander back to your foxhole so they can come up and throw a hand grenade in.
[00:42:54.437 --> 00:42:55.438]  Just a military tactic.
[00:42:56.986 --> 00:43:01.629]  They even say now on local news, Trans-Texas Corridor doesn't exist.
[00:43:01.629 --> 00:43:02.330]  You can look it up.
[00:43:02.330 --> 00:43:03.831]  I mean, you know, it's all over.
[00:43:03.831 --> 00:43:04.611]  The billboards are up.
[00:43:04.611 --> 00:43:05.252]  They're doing it.
[00:43:05.252 --> 00:43:08.133]  It doesn't matter.
[00:43:08.133 --> 00:43:15.959]  This is psychological warfare, where they say, we're getting rid of America, but then it's to protect America.
[00:43:15.959 --> 00:43:22.303]  Jonathan Ellenhoff's here to talk about that, but also, they put in, to go to the Democratic National Convention,
[00:43:24.122 --> 00:43:29.566]  And I looked this up after they called us and told us about it yesterday, and sure enough, we did a lot of research.
[00:43:29.566 --> 00:43:32.088]  And Jason Burmiss is here in town doing some work with us.
[00:43:32.088 --> 00:43:34.290]  He already knew about it weeks ago, I learned.
[00:43:34.290 --> 00:43:38.353]  We went to their website, and basically, they're hiring anarchists.
[00:43:38.353 --> 00:43:48.822]  They're going to have them in these clown outfits with body armor, shields, and bank robber masks, a little, you know, over their eyes.
[00:43:51.600 --> 00:44:00.987]  And they are the group, the only group out of hundreds that tried, because, you know, oh, you have a First Amendment, you come to us and there's a lottery, and then we decide if you can protest.
[00:44:00.987 --> 00:44:04.229]  And, uh, they say, oh yes, uh, this group got the lottery.
[00:44:04.229 --> 00:44:07.471]  Oh, and then the Democratic Party magically got, won the lottery, too.
[00:44:07.471 --> 00:44:09.233]  Yeah, if I forget, two, two, yeah, sure.
[00:44:09.233 --> 00:44:11.434]  If you believe that, I got a bridge I want to sell you.
[00:44:11.434 --> 00:44:19.280]  And so they will zoom into Democratic operatives, dressed up to look like idiots, throwing things at cops,
[00:44:22.415 --> 00:44:24.676]  Jonathan, break it down for us.
[00:44:24.676 --> 00:44:26.896]  Alex, good to be on your show.
[00:44:26.896 --> 00:44:27.897]  Good to have you.
[00:44:27.897 --> 00:44:30.357]  I should also add, you're the founder of We Are Change Colorado.
[00:44:30.357 --> 00:44:32.098]  Tell us what's happening.
[00:44:32.098 --> 00:44:36.599]  Well, I'm going to focus on Recreate the State here.
[00:44:36.599 --> 00:44:41.961]  The organizer, Glenn Spagnuolo, we talked with him on Sunday at his community meeting.
[00:44:41.961 --> 00:44:48.603]  And I asked him, are you planning any kind of direct violent confrontations, anything that can get you arrested?
[00:44:48.603 --> 00:44:51.404]  And he said, quote, oh, we're going to get arrested.
[00:44:51.843 --> 00:44:53.305]  We're already planning on getting arrested.
[00:44:53.305 --> 00:44:55.247]  The question is how long they're going to hold us.
[00:44:55.247 --> 00:45:00.393]  On the website it says, smash people's cameras, smash citizens' cameras.
[00:45:00.393 --> 00:45:01.895]  I mean, it's all men.
[00:45:01.895 --> 00:45:04.599]  And of course, to make protesters look bad.
[00:45:04.599 --> 00:45:04.919]  Right.
[00:45:04.919 --> 00:45:11.427]  And I advise them, I said, are you familiar with, you know, being violent and this kind of behavior is going to get people arrested?
[00:45:12.119 --> 00:45:14.402]  And he said, well, you know, that's only going to get us arrested.
[00:45:14.402 --> 00:45:20.029]  I said, well, if the police see you doing it and you're leading the group, the whole group's going to be this way.
[00:45:20.029 --> 00:45:30.642]  And the way they've set it up is any activist group that's coming into Denver is falling under Recreate 68 because they've given an open invite to them and they've actually gone out and contacted activist groups.
[00:45:31.397 --> 00:45:31.817]  I think so.
[00:45:52.518 --> 00:46:01.741]  I don't know if they realize that what they're doing is... And I don't know of a bear poops in the woods, but go ahead.
[00:46:01.741 --> 00:46:07.903]  I mean, I'm prepared to make... What they're doing is going to endanger the security and the safety of peaceful demonstrators.
[00:46:07.903 --> 00:46:16.265]  Well, did you see Seattle, where they bust in 50 people from a paramilitary Ford Foundation training camp, and the police guarded them in their own compound?
[00:46:16.265 --> 00:46:21.287]  And they allowed them to attack cops, cops were told to stand down, and then the cops attacked the peaceful people?
[00:46:21.287 --> 00:46:22.147]  Of course it's staged.
[00:46:22.627 --> 00:46:22.867]  Right.
[00:46:22.867 --> 00:46:24.248]  They issued permits for the free speech zone.
[00:46:39.645 --> 00:46:42.548]  And you had to apply for this lottery.
[00:46:42.548 --> 00:46:44.470]  It was supposed to be a blind lottery.
[00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:50.075]  Of course, the big anti-war protest, they weren't issued their permit for the city of Denver.
[00:46:50.075 --> 00:46:51.236]  Yeah, their permit!
[00:46:51.236 --> 00:46:52.417]  You don't need a permit!
[00:46:52.417 --> 00:46:55.340]  That government is criminal and anti-American!
[00:46:56.120 --> 00:46:57.881]  See how this works, folks?
[00:46:57.881 --> 00:46:58.782]  It's just like gun control.
[00:46:58.782 --> 00:47:04.985]  First, they say in New York, oh, you can have a gun, but you've got to get a permit, and then they don't issue the permit anymore.
[00:47:04.985 --> 00:47:07.306]  Well, it's the same thing with this.
[00:47:07.306 --> 00:47:09.767]  You can't do that with our First Amendment, you criminals!
[00:47:09.767 --> 00:47:10.688]  Go ahead.
[00:47:10.688 --> 00:47:22.354]  Right, and the thing is, you know, they've started this massive... The article's up on TruthAlliance.net, by the way, if you want to see a full background of what we were able to find on them.
[00:47:23.337 --> 00:47:29.542]  And basically, this group used to be known as the Denver Action Network.
[00:47:29.542 --> 00:47:34.386]  During the globalization protest back in 99, there was the Dan Group.
[00:47:34.386 --> 00:47:41.591]  And the two who organized the Denver Action Network were Barb and Mark Cohen, who happened to be the two coordinators of Recreate 68.
[00:47:42.668 --> 00:47:52.072]  Now, they were responsible back in 2000 for having people arrested, thrown in hospitals, thrown in jail, that people were hurt from a big protest at Kohl's.
[00:47:52.072 --> 00:47:54.333]  I broke the story on truthalliance.net.
[00:47:54.333 --> 00:47:54.914]  It's there.
[00:47:54.914 --> 00:47:55.834]  We were able to confirm it.
[00:47:55.834 --> 00:47:56.694]  I asked them about it.
[00:47:56.694 --> 00:47:58.615]  They don't want to comment on it.
[00:47:58.615 --> 00:48:09.220]  But basically what the story was is the Denver Justice Peace Coalition was down there protesting outside of a Kohl's to which they showed up and inspired all the young kids.
[00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:10.901]  Well, the larger issue is
[00:48:11.573 --> 00:48:12.394]  This is what's happening.
[00:48:12.394 --> 00:48:13.776]  The Feds go set this up.
[00:48:13.776 --> 00:48:15.659]  They use their operatives as a front.
[00:48:15.659 --> 00:48:23.811]  That's why they're contacting all the groups and saying, show up in our free speech zone as an attempt to co-op the entire peace movement, which has already co-opted all over the place.
[00:48:23.811 --> 00:48:25.734]  It isn't just this group.
[00:48:25.734 --> 00:48:27.297]  And then they plan to have you all there.
[00:48:27.717 --> 00:48:31.178]  So the anarchists can run around and they'll step aside on video.
[00:48:31.178 --> 00:48:32.418]  The cops will give the nod.
[00:48:32.418 --> 00:48:34.139]  You'll even see the anarchists.
[00:48:34.139 --> 00:48:34.919]  They'll give the nod.
[00:48:34.919 --> 00:48:36.660]  There'll be an anarchist cop leading it.
[00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:37.520]  He'll step aside.
[00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:39.800]  Rubber bullets will be fired at the peaceful people.
[00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:44.762]  Strollers will be attacked, like in Portland and places.
[00:48:44.762 --> 00:48:46.322]  And it's just total black op.
[00:48:46.322 --> 00:48:48.223]  The group should show up at different places.
[00:48:48.223 --> 00:48:49.663]  Everybody should do whatever they want.
[00:48:49.663 --> 00:48:50.783]  Don't follow orders.
[00:48:50.783 --> 00:48:52.544]  Protest however you want.
[00:48:52.544 --> 00:48:52.684]  Right.
[00:48:53.323 --> 00:48:57.085]  And they have a whole demonstration itinerary.
[00:48:57.085 --> 00:48:59.827]  On itinerary for the cops, of course.
[00:48:59.827 --> 00:49:13.714]  Right, and what happened back in 2000 resulted in the ACLU filing lawsuits against the city of Golden because that vandalism that they did to that Kohl's department store resulted in the Denver Police allowing to get warrants and label D.J.P.O.
[00:49:13.714 --> 00:49:14.815]  or D.J.P.C.
[00:49:14.815 --> 00:49:16.015]  as a terrorist organization.
[00:49:16.015 --> 00:49:17.096]  They got everyone's names
[00:49:18.199 --> 00:49:33.671]  We'll see, it's the same thing they do over and over again, where they hired, this is admitted folks, 50 thugs to attack Nike Town and attack cops, and the cops were ordered to stand down, and then they go get housed in a government building in Seattle, and then it came out that quote, Delta Force was running it.
[00:49:33.671 --> 00:49:36.033]  That's in my film, Police Take to the Takeover.
[00:49:36.033 --> 00:49:40.516]  This is serious business, and the police are running this.
[00:49:40.516 --> 00:49:43.719]  Absolutely, and their days of resistance demonstrations include
[00:49:44.691 --> 00:49:53.093]  A massive anti-war march in which they're telling people to lock arms and approach the Pepsi Center, approach the police lines.
[00:49:53.093 --> 00:49:54.833]  And I said, well, you can't get in.
[00:49:54.833 --> 00:49:55.873]  You're not going to be able to get in.
[00:49:55.873 --> 00:49:57.473]  And they said, well, we have citizens.
[00:49:57.473 --> 00:49:58.874]  We have a right to get in.
[00:49:58.874 --> 00:50:03.394]  Well, obviously, they're going to be talking about a direct physical confrontation on that march.
[00:50:03.394 --> 00:50:10.596]  They have one called Shake Your Money Maker, where they're going to be surrounding the Denver Mint and literally shaking the fences, which we talked to the Denver Mint.
[00:50:10.596 --> 00:50:11.896]  They said if anyone attempts to
[00:50:12.496 --> 00:50:13.137]  I don't think so.
[00:50:28.893 --> 00:50:31.074]  We've got to get the word out on this.
[00:50:31.074 --> 00:50:31.574]  Stay there my friend.
[00:50:52.975 --> 00:51:06.126]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[00:51:06.126 --> 00:51:17.195]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[00:51:17.195 --> 00:51:19.437]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose
[00:51:20.598 --> 00:51:22.359]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[00:51:22.359 --> 00:51:28.482]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[00:52:52.782 --> 00:52:54.063]  I'm Dr. Bill Diggle, M.D.
[00:52:54.063 --> 00:52:56.484]  of the Nutrimedical Report here on Genesis.
[00:52:56.484 --> 00:52:59.526]  Allicin, a natural antibiotic from Allomax Nutraceuticals U.S.
[00:52:59.526 --> 00:53:00.286]  is a real thing.
[00:53:00.286 --> 00:53:07.290]  This amazing molecule is a stabilized antimicrobial antipathogenic killer from fresh, never before available garlic.
[00:53:07.290 --> 00:53:18.296]  Allicin molecule is biologically active against all bacterial pathogens, viruses, fungi, parasites, TB, and it kills fleshy bacteria, MRSA, Acinetobacter infections that ravage our everyday health.
[00:53:18.296 --> 00:53:21.478]  Taken daily, it removes these stealth pathogens, clearing our bodies
[00:53:21.638 --> 00:53:22.018]  I think so.
[00:53:56.377 --> 00:54:04.141]  The federal government has admitted, major papers have admitted, that the Pentagon spies on even the smallest peace groups.
[00:54:04.141 --> 00:54:04.761]  That's right, U.S.
[00:54:04.761 --> 00:54:05.041]  military.
[00:54:05.041 --> 00:54:10.704]  What you pay for against the American people,
[00:54:27.253 --> 00:54:28.013]  Totally illegal.
[00:54:28.013 --> 00:54:31.774]  It's been admitted it's illegal and the government just says we are criminals.
[00:54:31.774 --> 00:54:33.155]  Shut up!
[00:54:33.155 --> 00:54:36.636]  We'll do what we want, when we want, how we want.
[00:54:36.636 --> 00:54:46.139]  And they know that as they take your pension funds, as they start new wars, as they arrest people, as they put people in FEMA camps, you're going to try to protest.
[00:54:46.139 --> 00:54:55.622]  And that's why they got microwave guns and sound cannons and riot police ready and ready to drive the buses and the relocation centers built at every major airport like we have here in Austin.
[00:54:57.271 --> 00:54:59.833]  Not just at Bergstrom, but at the old Robert Mueller.
[00:54:59.833 --> 00:55:02.155]  They got a facility out there to chain you to the floor.
[00:55:02.155 --> 00:55:04.537]  We've got that in my film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:55:04.537 --> 00:55:05.598]  And now it's all admitted.
[00:55:05.598 --> 00:55:07.700]  I'm kind of passe now.
[00:55:07.700 --> 00:55:12.204]  What I talked about a decade plus ago is now mainstream news.
[00:55:12.204 --> 00:55:15.967]  But it's hard for them to attack peaceful groups.
[00:55:15.967 --> 00:55:16.948]  Gandhi proved that.
[00:55:18.024 --> 00:55:22.287]  But, and the British did try this, some with Ghani, but folks saw through that too.
[00:55:22.287 --> 00:55:25.309]  So they have people dressed up in the crowd who will do violent things.
[00:55:25.309 --> 00:55:35.054]  Or sometimes, if they can't do that, if it's not a hired foundation group, like these organizations are, they will just have cops attack cops, and they've been caught all over doing that.
[00:55:35.054 --> 00:55:43.860]  In Europe they've been caught, they've been caught in Canada this last year, and that was in major papers that they did stage attacks on themselves to then attack peaceful people.
[00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:47.382]  It's very criminal, it is a form of false flag terrorism.
[00:55:49.349 --> 00:56:09.162]  And then they designate the peaceful people as terrorists after they engage in the terrorism and uh... but it's it's for the couch potatoes at home going look at those bad protesters you know throwing them all off cocktails basically and that's the image they then sell now only higher echelons of the police are even aware of this
[00:56:10.294 --> 00:56:13.037]  But that's the image they need.
[00:56:13.037 --> 00:56:13.837]  It's now been admitted.
[00:56:13.837 --> 00:56:36.538]  We wrote articles and posted stories of photos where it showed flatback trucks with hundreds of Chinese police being handed the robes of the Tibetans and then it shows the very police in the robes with machetes running around in front of cameras waving giant swords and attacking buildings and burning them.
[00:56:38.553 --> 00:56:44.010]  And then that way they get to have a mass arrest of Tibetans.
[00:56:44.010 --> 00:56:46.197]  So, this is the same thing and they do it here.
[00:56:47.242 --> 00:56:49.524]  And until you realize that, it's only going to get worse.
[00:56:49.524 --> 00:57:04.656]  Jonathan Ellenhoff, I want to briefly get into the Gary Hart situation, too, but finish up your points about when the Democratic Committee is going to be there, when the convention is, where it's located, and we need people to be there videotaping this and documenting the activities.
[00:57:04.656 --> 00:57:06.618]  You need to be videotaping the leaders.
[00:57:06.618 --> 00:57:12.262]  You need to have teams simultaneously with video cameras on them and the police for signals.
[00:57:12.262 --> 00:57:16.386]  That's how we caught them up in Canada last year, was off the signals and in their boots.
[00:57:17.031 --> 00:57:19.312]  But anything else on that?
[00:57:19.312 --> 00:57:28.414]  Yeah, there's a memo that went out along peace, police and hospitals here locally in Denver advising people of terrorism and anarchist groups.
[00:57:28.414 --> 00:57:30.055]  They name Retreat 68.
[00:57:30.055 --> 00:57:33.116]  It's in the article on Truth Alliance that posts the memo for people to see.
[00:57:33.116 --> 00:57:35.076]  Kaiser put it out.
[00:57:35.076 --> 00:57:43.639]  And so did all the articles which are saying, you know, Michelle Malkin, the neo-conceived conservative mouthpiece also already voiced that they're going to be violent.
[00:57:44.264 --> 00:57:49.436]  Everyone's basically manifesting this group to be really violent and we're doing everything we can to stop this.
[00:57:50.191 --> 00:57:51.131]  We are Change Colorado.
[00:57:51.131 --> 00:57:58.313]  We did get a member call that said that she did get granted permission to apply for a permit, but we haven't found out what's going on with that.
[00:57:58.313 --> 00:57:59.853]  But we are Change Colorado.
[00:57:59.853 --> 00:58:01.993]  We'll be down there documenting all this.
[00:58:01.993 --> 00:58:07.054]  If you want to link to any of this stuff... You've got to have a permit to have a camera on the city street.
[00:58:07.054 --> 00:58:09.755]  We're going to watch you with cameras, but you're not going to have one.
[00:58:09.755 --> 00:58:11.935]  You think this is a free country, boy?
[00:58:11.935 --> 00:58:15.196]  You pay taxes, you can lick our boots up and down.
[00:58:15.196 --> 00:58:15.516]  Stay there.
[00:58:15.516 --> 00:58:16.976]  I'm going to shift gears into Gary Hart.
[00:58:18.271 --> 00:58:22.192]  We'll be right back with our guest, Jonathan Elinoff, on the other side.
[00:58:22.192 --> 00:58:25.313]  Then I'm going to get into a bunch of other news on the economy, you name it.
[00:58:25.313 --> 00:58:33.534]  This is the one, the only GCN Radio Network.
[00:58:33.534 --> 00:58:34.935]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:34.935 --> 00:58:43.157]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:43.157 --> 00:58:44.457]  It is a big idea.
[00:58:45.618 --> 00:58:47.379]  A New World Order.
[00:58:47.379 --> 00:58:52.260]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:58:52.260 --> 00:58:55.101]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:58:55.101 --> 00:58:57.882]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:58:57.882 --> 00:59:01.083]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:59:01.083 --> 00:59:08.385]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:59:11.427 --> 00:59:16.870]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:59:16.870 --> 00:59:20.192]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:59:20.192 --> 00:59:23.314]  The Oval Party is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:59:23.314 --> 00:59:24.474]  Most people have no idea.
[00:59:24.474 --> 00:59:25.255]  They're not after money.
[00:59:25.255 --> 00:59:26.535]  They have all the money they need.
[00:59:26.535 --> 00:59:27.516]  They're after power.
[00:59:27.516 --> 00:59:28.656]  That's what they're after these years.

[00:59:37.383 --> 00:59:38.144]  Endgame.
[00:59:38.144 --> 00:59:40.166]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:59:40.166 --> 00:59:45.332]  You have been warned.
[00:59:45.332 --> 00:59:47.734]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:47.734 --> 00:59:50.497]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:59:57.375 --> 00:59:59.136]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:59.136 --> 01:00:00.716]  You want answers?
[01:00:00.716 --> 01:00:02.277]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:02.277 --> 01:00:06.458]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:06.458 --> 01:00:11.840]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:21.904]  Every major government hires thugs and imports groups to provocateur so the police can attack peaceful demonstrations.
[01:00:21.904 --> 01:00:25.625]  They've been taught everywhere from the US to Canada to England to China.
[01:00:27.856 --> 01:00:32.339]  Jonathan Ellenhoff is the founder of We Are Change Colorado.
[01:00:32.339 --> 01:00:38.903]  They've really broken some important information about how they're planning to stage events at the Democratic National Convention.
[01:00:38.903 --> 01:00:45.527]  Finish up with your points on that, then I want to get into the amazing confrontations you've been having with Gary Hart and play a clip of it.
[01:00:45.527 --> 01:00:46.968]  Sure thing.
[01:00:46.968 --> 01:00:54.572]  We did go to the meeting on Sunday here for Recreate 68, and we were able to find a group, RAME-D, who we got, by the way, all this on camera.
[01:00:54.572 --> 01:00:57.354]  We're going to be getting it up on Truthlines, and We Are Change's site soon.
[01:00:57.915 --> 01:00:59.516]  We're still editing it.
[01:00:59.516 --> 01:01:06.401]  And basically they admitted to us, first of all, I said, are you familiar with Gandhi and the success of Martin Luther King being peaceful?
[01:01:06.401 --> 01:01:11.906]  And that's when the founder of ReMD said, and these are the guys, by the way, running Recreate 68, just heads up on that.
[01:01:11.906 --> 01:01:16.549]  He said to me, he goes, well, look, violence is the only thing these effing cops understand.
[01:01:16.549 --> 01:01:18.751]  And I looked at him and I was like, are you kidding me?
[01:01:19.853 --> 01:01:22.494]  So, that was what kicked off the whole debate.
[01:01:22.494 --> 01:01:25.615]  We then started talking about violence not being effective.
[01:01:25.615 --> 01:01:31.056]  He handed me a DVD that he made called Troublemaker that he's been handing out at the Recreate 68 meetings.
[01:01:31.056 --> 01:01:34.437]  This DVD is put out by this ReMD group.
[01:01:34.437 --> 01:01:38.578]  It's Revolutionary Anti-Imperialist Movement Denver is what it stands for.
[01:01:38.578 --> 01:01:40.879]  It's all up on that TruthAlliance.net article.
[01:01:40.879 --> 01:01:42.519]  It's all verified.
[01:01:42.519 --> 01:01:44.080]  They even admit all this.
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:48.961]  And they're telling people to bring bags of blood and urine and throw it on the cops.
[01:01:50.430 --> 01:01:50.750]  No joke.
[01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:52.051]  This is against the law.
[01:01:52.051 --> 01:02:05.676]  You can get attempted murder for that, and they know that some weak-minded person will do it, that soul will burn, and then these guys that are doing this, they'll end up being Barack Obama someday, end up being President.
[01:02:05.676 --> 01:02:06.996]  See, that's how they work, folks.
[01:02:06.996 --> 01:02:08.197]  This is totally staged.
[01:02:08.197 --> 01:02:09.097]  Go ahead.
[01:02:09.097 --> 01:02:13.859]  This whole thing is designed to sabotage any, it's going to drown out any message we have
[01:02:14.637 --> 01:02:20.182]  And all this is under the umbrella of Recreate 68, and so that's why we started looking into this group.
[01:02:20.182 --> 01:02:22.063]  We're trying to get the word out now.
[01:02:22.063 --> 01:02:24.825]  We want to contact every activist group and advise them.
[01:02:24.825 --> 01:02:26.487]  Are you familiar with what's going on in Denver?
[01:02:26.487 --> 01:02:27.568]  Do you know about the protests?
[01:02:27.568 --> 01:02:28.889]  We've got to blow their op.
[01:02:28.889 --> 01:02:30.630]  We've got to blow their op.
[01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:36.875]  If you have a DVD of that, you've got to get that video up now, and you've got to demand the police.
[01:02:36.875 --> 01:02:38.737]  And you can pull these cases up.
[01:02:38.737 --> 01:02:44.061]  People who've spit blood on cops have gotten 20 years in prison because it is a dangerous bodily fluid.
[01:02:46.582 --> 01:02:50.345]  They are calling for hardcore felonies if what you're saying is true.
[01:02:50.345 --> 01:02:53.147]  I know they've got shields and weapons on the website.
[01:02:53.147 --> 01:02:55.969]  You're telling me they're calling for throwing blood on people?
[01:02:55.969 --> 01:03:02.834]  This is Raim D and it's a violent anarchist group that's attending the Recreate 68 meetings and they're giving an open arm.
[01:03:02.834 --> 01:03:08.458]  By the way, they gave us the stiff arm when we said, would you allow 9-11 Truth to have any speakers?
[01:03:08.458 --> 01:03:10.560]  I know we have big names like Willie Nelson and all these.
[01:03:11.041 --> 01:03:13.163]  I know you're trying to put on a concert down there at the DNC.
[01:03:13.163 --> 01:03:16.886]  I said, if you give an open arm to us, I said, our group, our movement's huge.
[01:03:16.886 --> 01:03:18.527]  We would love this opportunity.
[01:03:18.527 --> 01:03:19.428]  He said, no.
[01:03:19.428 --> 01:03:20.829]  We don't agree with 9-11.
[01:03:20.829 --> 01:03:21.670]  You stay away from us.
[01:03:21.670 --> 01:03:27.735]  And that's when I looked at him and I said, you're giving every activist group an invite and an open arm, and you stiff-arm us?
[01:03:27.735 --> 01:03:28.996]  Look at Noam Chomsky.
[01:03:28.996 --> 01:03:30.217]  Look at Bobbitt.
[01:03:30.217 --> 01:03:31.518]  They're all operatives.
[01:03:31.518 --> 01:03:35.161]  They're operatives.
[01:03:35.161 --> 01:03:36.963]  Yeah, the whole thing stinks.
[01:03:36.963 --> 01:03:38.244]  It's just not adding up.
[01:03:38.985 --> 01:03:47.487]  So this really... Look, there are state police, there are defense intelligence, there are army, navy, they're all, there's homeland security in there.
[01:03:47.487 --> 01:03:56.869]  And I am, look, they'll find some young kids, mail fertilizer to their house, who they were planning to bomb.
[01:03:56.869 --> 01:04:05.031]  Remember Nixon was planning to bomb a major convention, but then it got exposed, to then blame it on terrorists.
[01:04:05.031 --> 01:04:06.331]  And that's declassified, so
[01:04:07.319 --> 01:04:09.561]  Very dangerous, very dangerous.
[01:04:09.561 --> 01:04:12.703]  Give us more intel.
[01:04:12.703 --> 01:04:22.291]  The memo that was sent out to all the hotels and all the police departments advised everyone to be prepared for terrorism, mass riots, to handle 35,000 to 50,000 injuries.
[01:04:22.291 --> 01:04:23.151]  You name it.
[01:04:23.151 --> 01:04:24.573]  Everyone's preparing in Denver.
[01:04:24.573 --> 01:04:25.773]  They're getting all the press.
[01:04:25.773 --> 01:04:28.095]  And we've had to fight to get on the media.
[01:04:28.095 --> 01:04:30.157]  And they got it almost instantaneously.
[01:04:30.157 --> 01:04:31.418]  They've been building up this press.
[01:04:32.145 --> 01:04:36.492]  And they magically won the lottery to be the controlling group.
[01:04:36.492 --> 01:04:41.079]  Oh, yes, it's... Yes, they're very good people.
[01:04:41.079 --> 01:04:45.165]  Black Ops, ladies and gentlemen, exposing the enemy's tactics.
[01:04:45.165 --> 01:04:47.189]  Stay there, I want to hear about Gary Hart, another traitor.
[01:04:50.034 --> 01:04:51.995]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:04:51.995 --> 01:04:55.597]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:04:55.597 --> 01:04:58.059]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:04:58.059 --> 01:05:01.101]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:05:01.101 --> 01:05:06.824]  It is essential that Patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[01:05:06.824 --> 01:05:10.747]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[01:05:11.067 --> 01:05:16.268]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[01:05:16.268 --> 01:05:19.309]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[01:05:44.239 --> 01:05:46.381]  Put them on the file sharing networks.
[01:05:46.381 --> 01:05:48.142]  Bring down the New World Order.
[01:05:48.142 --> 01:05:48.903]  PrisonPlanet.TV
[01:05:50.356 --> 01:05:59.279]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:05:59.279 --> 01:06:04.421]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:06:04.421 --> 01:06:15.545]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[01:06:15.945 --> 01:06:21.728]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:06:21.728 --> 01:06:27.992]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:06:27.992 --> 01:06:29.032]  What about you?
[01:06:29.032 --> 01:06:30.954]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally.

[01:06:50.646 --> 01:06:51.446]  Hi, neighbor.
[01:06:51.446 --> 01:06:54.748]  They say the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[01:06:54.748 --> 01:07:00.030]  Certainly we'd never intend to procrastinate getting our own food supply until there was none left at any price.
[01:07:00.030 --> 01:07:05.773]  We would intend to have plenty of food so the relief organizations could care for those unable to care for themselves.
[01:07:05.773 --> 01:07:13.376]  We would intend not to be standing in the breadline with the ignorant and the foolish who pretend the facts of food disappearance are untrue.
[01:07:13.376 --> 01:07:18.278]  If the experience of the Katrina disaster is evidence, the breadline may have no bread.
[01:07:18.889 --> 01:07:26.711]  Just like the good intentions on the road to that unheavenly place, the good intentions alone to get a supply of food will not feed us.
[01:07:26.711 --> 01:07:31.152]  Only getting our food supply immediately will make us independent and fearless for the future.
[01:07:31.152 --> 01:07:32.132]  Call 800-409-5633.
[01:07:32.132 --> 01:07:32.212]  800-409-5633.
[01:07:32.212 --> 01:07:33.193]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[01:07:33.193 --> 01:07:33.513]  Who am I?
[01:07:33.513 --> 01:07:33.653]  Nobody.
[01:07:33.653 --> 01:07:34.813]  Steve Schenck, Someone Who Cares.
[01:07:49.793 --> 01:07:55.194]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:07:55.194 --> 01:08:13.459]  Because there's a war on for your mind.

[01:08:28.785 --> 01:08:36.190]  The first three hours are on the AM and FM dials, simulcast on the satellite, the internet global shortwave.
[01:08:36.190 --> 01:08:46.358]  But The Fourth Hour is only available at InfoWars.com until next Monday, and then it will be on the GCN radio network, and affiliates will be able to get it.
[01:08:46.358 --> 01:08:48.319]  We're very honored that they want to pick it up and thankful.

[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:32.621]  It streams out to you live.
[01:09:32.621 --> 01:09:34.462]  And some days I do more than an extra hour.
[01:09:34.462 --> 01:09:37.184]  We have a document cam, a guest cam.
[01:09:37.184 --> 01:09:40.285]  We play exclusive video clips here first.
[01:09:40.285 --> 01:09:44.327]  PrisonPlanet.tv, 15 cents a day for your membership.
[01:09:44.327 --> 01:09:48.970]  Going back to the founder of We Are Change Colorado, Jonathan Elenoff.
[01:09:50.943 --> 01:09:55.967]  Any other key points you want to add about the provocateur operations?
[01:09:55.967 --> 01:10:01.332]  Very upsetting what you're telling me and I'm looking it up right now.
[01:10:01.332 --> 01:10:05.835]  You have the memos going out of the hospitals, the police, everybody the terrorists are going to hit.
[01:10:05.835 --> 01:10:14.302]  There's going to be riots and 30-40,000 people injured or killed and that there's anarchist groups doing it.
[01:10:14.302 --> 01:10:15.243]  I mean if that was the case,
[01:10:15.979 --> 01:10:18.921]  And these anarchist groups are always calling for criminal things.
[01:10:18.921 --> 01:10:20.042]  Why aren't they being arrested?
[01:10:20.042 --> 01:10:21.483]  Now, I want to be clear.
[01:10:21.483 --> 01:10:25.126]  There are real anarchist groups that like to dress in black and are for no government.
[01:10:25.126 --> 01:10:28.708]  And, you know, some groups that are wearing three-piece suits.
[01:10:28.708 --> 01:10:33.151]  But the Black Bloc, as it's known, are the mainline anarchists.
[01:10:33.151 --> 01:10:36.494]  I've seen them starting fights in Austin at the Fortune 500.
[01:10:36.494 --> 01:10:38.415]  And I saw them getting orders from cops.
[01:10:38.415 --> 01:10:40.616]  And I had one walk up and say, we're going to kill you someday.
[01:10:40.616 --> 01:10:42.258]  Yeah, we work for the government.
[01:10:42.258 --> 01:10:45.440]  That's why if you really talk to them, they'll go, communism, man, Mao Zedong.
[01:10:45.987 --> 01:10:48.928]  But then they'll act like they're anarchist.
[01:10:48.928 --> 01:10:54.631]  Because, A, the globalists don't want you to know that there's still a huge communist influence that our government controls.
[01:10:54.631 --> 01:10:56.392]  So, for the public, oh, it's anarchist.
[01:10:56.392 --> 01:10:59.873]  That's why they're wearing red stars.
[01:10:59.873 --> 01:11:01.694]  But that's another cover itself.
[01:11:01.694 --> 01:11:04.375]  They're just government operatives.
[01:11:04.375 --> 01:11:05.856]  And they're lazy scum.
[01:11:05.856 --> 01:11:08.877]  They go to, like, 10, 15 events a year, max.
[01:11:08.877 --> 01:11:13.439]  They start fights, stage stuff with police, and then they get 50 grand a year.
[01:11:13.439 --> 01:11:14.860]  They're very well taken care of.
[01:11:16.150 --> 01:11:20.592]  And, you know, they leave the events and get in their sports cars and drive back to their apartments.
[01:11:20.592 --> 01:11:23.493]  And it's a wonderful way to destroy freedom.
[01:11:23.493 --> 01:11:24.593]  They were caught in Genoa.
[01:11:24.593 --> 01:11:29.214]  Remember in Italy, when the police ran over people with tanks and things?
[01:11:29.214 --> 01:11:33.216]  They were caught there staging stuff and then starting the violence so the cops could attack.
[01:11:33.216 --> 01:11:42.499]  Going back to Jonathan, they're really worried about Democrats showing up and pointing out that the party's pro-war, so I guess they mean to discredit everybody with a black op, John.
[01:11:43.217 --> 01:11:44.078]  Absolutely.
[01:11:44.078 --> 01:11:44.718]  They're going to drown.
[01:11:44.718 --> 01:11:51.082]  We've been trying to get, you know, 9-11 public, the anti-war movement going.
[01:11:51.082 --> 01:11:54.844]  They've hurt all of our efforts here in Denver trying to get this big.
[01:11:54.844 --> 01:11:59.987]  Denver started passing all kinds of laws that are all unconstitutional, like a curfew at 10.30 p.m.
[01:11:59.987 --> 01:12:02.189]  that they're going to enforce.
[01:12:02.189 --> 01:12:08.232]  Of course, Recreate 68 is intentionally making a statement saying... Now, is that a curfew for adults as well?
[01:12:08.232 --> 01:12:10.193]  For a street curfew, 10.30 p.m.,
[01:12:11.527 --> 01:12:13.809]  It's the week of the 20th.
[01:12:13.809 --> 01:12:14.750]  That came out.
[01:12:14.750 --> 01:12:19.996]  They're also... Well, that is martial law, and I may fly to Denver now and get arrested and then sue them.
[01:12:19.996 --> 01:12:22.839]  Because, I mean, this is so evil.
[01:12:22.839 --> 01:12:24.801]  And of course, it's all selectively enforced.
[01:12:24.801 --> 01:12:25.782]  You know, a lot of U.S.
[01:12:25.782 --> 01:12:28.245]  cities have curfews for adults now.
[01:12:28.245 --> 01:12:30.087]  I mean, folks, that's martial law.
[01:12:30.087 --> 01:12:31.929]  That is martial law.
[01:12:31.929 --> 01:12:32.630]  Please, tell me more.
[01:12:33.924 --> 01:12:46.947]  The security zone and the free speech zone are going to be announced in mid-June, and the purpose of that was because it only gives a couple of months for people to make cases against it legally, which isn't, if anyone knows the court system, that's not enough time.
[01:12:46.947 --> 01:12:51.507]  So they pushed announcing the security zone and free speech zone all the way to mid-June.
[01:12:51.507 --> 01:12:53.488]  Now they're saying it might be the end of June.
[01:12:53.488 --> 01:12:59.709]  And by the way, this security zone is a 12-foot fence that they're building around the Pepsi Center and the Denver Convention Center.
[01:13:00.644 --> 01:13:04.947]  And nobody can approach the convention unless you're bussed in.
[01:13:04.947 --> 01:13:06.808]  Gates open, you enter and gates close.
[01:13:06.808 --> 01:13:08.088]  That's a giant camp.
[01:13:08.088 --> 01:13:12.711]  Now, they've also done drills at that convention center to put people in it as a camp.
[01:13:12.711 --> 01:13:18.454]  So I assure you, this fence around it, because I saw the plan in 2001, is actually a FEMA takeover drill.
[01:13:18.454 --> 01:13:25.939]  So they'll actually be practicing the movement of people and processing with people going to the DNC, never even knowing they're part of a larger drill.
[01:13:25.939 --> 01:13:29.721]  Now, look into that, you'll actually find that's the truth, Jonathan.
[01:13:30.273 --> 01:13:30.593]  Sure.
[01:13:30.593 --> 01:13:33.875]  Expanding out on that.
[01:13:33.875 --> 01:13:38.418]  Man, they are just so over the top to destroy freedom in this country, aren't they?
[01:13:39.025 --> 01:13:39.545]  Absolutely.
[01:13:39.545 --> 01:13:45.767]  This is all just a big sabotage to drown out any effort to get the real issues known.
[01:13:45.767 --> 01:13:55.591]  All of the groups that I know, including our group, have been fighting very hard to get our message heard, and this is going to do a complete 180 on everything we've done.
[01:13:55.591 --> 01:13:58.612]  So we're distancing ourselves from Recreate 68 as much as possible.
[01:13:58.612 --> 01:14:06.454]  We're exposing Reim D as, well, they should be arrested for, I mean, what they're talking about is direct violations of law.
[01:14:06.454 --> 01:14:07.235]  But they won't be.
[01:14:07.235 --> 01:14:07.735]  They won't be.
[01:14:08.487 --> 01:14:09.488]  They won't be though.
[01:14:09.488 --> 01:14:12.952]  They're going to get promotions and probably a sergeant's stripe.
[01:14:12.952 --> 01:14:14.274]  Yeah, this is just horrible.
[01:14:14.274 --> 01:14:17.437]  And so this whole thing is just, it's just stinking really bad.
[01:14:17.437 --> 01:14:27.308]  Well, I mean, here's the government openly trying to violate your rights and trying to, you know, announce the free speech zone late so you can't sue them because it's all getting thrown out of court.
[01:14:27.308 --> 01:14:29.650]  The government is criminal, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:14:29.650 --> 01:14:29.991]  Go ahead.
[01:14:30.925 --> 01:14:35.467]  So, um, I put a ton of stuff in that article on Truth Alliance.
[01:14:35.467 --> 01:14:37.847]  Feel free to link to it on InfoWars or put it up there.
[01:14:37.847 --> 01:14:52.132]  I want to get this information out to everyone so they can prepare themselves and educate themselves and basically equip themselves with the knowledge that if they're coming to Denver, they need to know about what's been happening because they're not talking about it on the mainstream corporate news.
[01:14:52.132 --> 01:14:53.372]  It's all over our papers.
[01:14:53.372 --> 01:14:55.173]  It's all over our local news.
[01:14:55.649 --> 01:15:10.635]  But nobody else knows, but I still know people that don't even know the convention is going to be here, and we've been going through a massive transition, fighting all these unconstitutional laws, trying to get press, and it's just been a rollercoaster ride, to be honest with you.
[01:15:11.829 --> 01:15:21.122]  You know, if these were real protests, they'd tell 100,000 people to show up and then be in big phone bank centers all making calls to every talk show in the country.
[01:15:21.122 --> 01:15:23.566]  That would be hundreds of millions hearing it.
[01:15:23.566 --> 01:15:26.790]  They would have people there, you know, doing live streaming on the web.
[01:15:26.790 --> 01:15:28.713]  They would have people protesting different areas.
[01:15:30.259 --> 01:15:31.540]  They would have people leafleting.
[01:15:31.540 --> 01:15:34.981]  Imagine getting a hundred thousand people in Denver to each hand out a hundred leaflets.
[01:15:34.981 --> 01:15:38.303]  Every person would get a leaflet, you know, a couple times.
[01:15:38.303 --> 01:15:48.627]  I mean, that's the type of it, but no, none of the whole peace movement is run by the Ford Foundation, run by the Defense Department, and for those who want to research that, that's a fact.
[01:15:48.627 --> 01:15:53.530]  They created the peace movement so they could control it, knowing a peace movement would develop.
[01:15:53.530 --> 01:15:56.211]  They then catalyzed it as an anti-gun movement.
[01:15:57.978 --> 01:16:01.482]  All I can say is, great job, Jonathan, and the reportage that's out there.
[01:16:01.482 --> 01:16:04.225]  Let's shift gears now, and we'll watch this as it develops.
[01:16:04.225 --> 01:16:06.127]  Let's shift gears into Gary Hart.
[01:16:06.127 --> 01:16:06.948]  Sure thing.
[01:16:06.948 --> 01:16:09.911]  We confirmed it at the Tattered Cover bookstore a couple weeks ago.
[01:16:09.911 --> 01:16:16.619]  I was able to co-op control of the mic, and I basically presented myself as Truth Alliance Network.
[01:16:17.279 --> 01:16:19.601]  Showed him a press pass, said, oh yeah, can we film?
[01:16:19.601 --> 01:16:26.086]  We got permission to film, and because I controlled the mic, I was able to control who gets asked the questions.
[01:16:26.086 --> 01:16:28.007]  So, obviously, I went around the room and picked all of them.
[01:16:28.007 --> 01:16:28.468]  We are changed.
[01:16:28.468 --> 01:16:30.489]  A couple of other people, but mainly we are changers.
[01:16:30.489 --> 01:16:36.594]  So, he was barraged for 25 minutes with questions from We Are Changed, and he just took a beating.
[01:16:36.594 --> 01:16:37.595]  We thought it was over.
[01:16:37.595 --> 01:16:40.357]  He decided to do another book announcement up in Boulder.
[01:16:40.357 --> 01:16:44.300]  We Are Changed Colorado attended that with Beeflog and Boulder 9-11 Visibility.
[01:16:45.413 --> 01:16:47.554]  Basically, it was a repeat only.
[01:16:47.554 --> 01:16:49.455]  We got him even better this time.
[01:16:49.455 --> 01:16:53.096]  We asked him about his New World Order statement, which he did make.
[01:16:53.096 --> 01:16:55.437]  September 13th, he made that statement.
[01:16:55.437 --> 01:16:58.718]  He said he was going to... Well, I have it on video in two of my films.
[01:16:58.718 --> 01:16:59.639]  Exactly.
[01:16:59.639 --> 01:17:01.199]  And nobody can deny that.
[01:17:01.199 --> 01:17:02.520]  I mean, he can't deny it.
[01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:04.981]  Sure, certainly, when asked about it, what did he do?
[01:17:04.981 --> 01:17:06.321]  He says, I never said that.
[01:17:06.321 --> 01:17:07.862]  You got your information wrong.
[01:17:07.862 --> 01:17:09.663]  Then he comes and says, well, we've seen it.
[01:17:09.663 --> 01:17:10.383]  It's on YouTube.
[01:17:10.856 --> 01:17:15.317]  He says, no, no, no, I'm not going to have a repeat of what we had at the Tatter Cover last week.
[01:17:15.317 --> 01:17:17.737]  And everyone was like, are you serious?
[01:17:17.737 --> 01:17:18.978]  Come on, Gary.
[01:17:18.978 --> 01:17:20.738]  Come on, you said it.
[01:17:20.738 --> 01:17:22.198]  We all know what you said.
[01:17:22.198 --> 01:17:29.139]  Then he goes out and says, it's three minutes into the video on Truth Alliance, by the way, is where that clip is.
[01:17:29.139 --> 01:17:33.720]  Then he goes on to say, well, what we do need is a new international order.
[01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:37.661]  He says, I've never said the term new world order, but we need a new international order.
[01:17:38.286 --> 01:17:42.249]  Okay, let's go ahead and play him denying, and then play the clip of him saying it.
[01:17:42.249 --> 01:17:44.130]  Go ahead.
[01:17:44.130 --> 01:17:52.977]  You rather famously said in front of the Council on Foreign Relations that we can use this disaster to bring about a new world order.
[01:17:52.977 --> 01:17:54.558]  I did not.
[01:17:54.558 --> 01:17:58.000]  I've never used that phrase in my life, so you've got some bad information.
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:17:58.320]  Really?
[01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:00.742]  I've seen you video after video after video saying it.
[01:18:02.546 --> 01:18:04.367]  I saw it on YouTube too.
[01:18:04.367 --> 01:18:06.549]  Gary Hart, you're coming out of your own mouth.
[01:18:06.549 --> 01:18:07.250]  No.
[01:18:07.250 --> 01:18:07.830]  Okay.
[01:18:07.830 --> 01:18:16.136]  George, I'm not going to repeat what we had at the bookstore.
[01:18:16.136 --> 01:18:17.977]  You can film this if you wish.
[01:18:17.977 --> 01:18:18.598]  It's up to you.
[01:18:18.598 --> 01:18:20.919]  It doesn't matter.
[01:18:20.919 --> 01:18:22.360]  But George H.W.
[01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:25.363]  Bush used the phrase, New World Order, once.
[01:18:25.363 --> 01:18:28.185]  And he never used it again.
[01:18:28.185 --> 01:18:29.866]  I saw him use that like eight times on YouTube.
[01:18:31.158 --> 01:18:33.020]  I'm not here to troll you.
[01:18:33.020 --> 01:18:33.961]  Better check it out.
[01:18:33.961 --> 01:18:36.204]  You ask me a question, I'm giving you an answer.
[01:18:36.204 --> 01:18:38.766]  Uh, side question, change the topic, we might be interviewing you.
[01:18:38.766 --> 01:18:40.048]  Okay, I'm sorry.
[01:18:40.048 --> 01:18:43.051]  And then we're going to go to other places.
[01:18:43.051 --> 01:18:44.893]  Okay.
[01:18:44.893 --> 01:18:50.179]  Now, um, later in the clip, didn't you insert the clip of him saying it?
[01:18:50.811 --> 01:18:55.372]  Yes, we inserted it right afterwards where we show all the times George Bush said the New World Order phrase.
[01:18:55.372 --> 01:19:00.753]  I'll tell you what, we're going to queue it up to that and come back and play it all on the other side.
[01:19:00.753 --> 01:19:06.154]  George Bush said New World Order in public more than 200 plus times.
[01:19:06.154 --> 01:19:10.075]  Vectors websites have chronicled all of them more than 30 times on video.
[01:19:10.075 --> 01:19:10.975]  Bill Clinton said it.
[01:19:10.975 --> 01:19:12.475]  Gordon Brown said it.
[01:19:12.475 --> 01:19:15.236]  Hitler called for it.
[01:19:15.236 --> 01:19:18.517]  And then here's Hart saying he never said the term New World Order.
[01:19:20.516 --> 01:19:24.237]  Brazen liar.
[01:19:24.237 --> 01:19:26.077]  He also says we're going to get attacked again.
[01:19:26.077 --> 01:19:30.438]  When asked about that, he says, I've been saying this for seven years consistently.
[01:19:30.438 --> 01:19:34.078]  He says he's adamant he knows we're going to get attacked again.
[01:19:34.078 --> 01:19:36.719]  He says, when asked about the FEMA camp, he says they don't exist.
[01:19:36.719 --> 01:19:37.839]  We said, what are you talking about?
[01:19:37.839 --> 01:19:39.039]  He says, well, what are your sources?
[01:19:39.039 --> 01:19:40.760]  He says, it's coming out of Canada.
[01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:43.320]  It's coming out, we've mentioned everything, all the sources.
[01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:47.401]  Well, San Francisco Chronicle, Houston Chronicle, WhiteHouse.gov.
[01:19:50.734 --> 01:19:52.154]  It is a big idea.
[01:19:52.154 --> 01:19:54.975]  A New World Order.
[01:19:54.975 --> 01:19:59.537]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:19:59.537 --> 01:20:02.698]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:20:02.698 --> 01:20:05.479]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:20:05.479 --> 01:20:08.660]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:20:08.660 --> 01:20:15.982]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:20:19.028 --> 01:20:24.452]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:20:24.452 --> 01:20:28.334]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:20:28.334 --> 01:20:30.896]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:20:30.896 --> 01:20:32.057]  Most people have no idea.
[01:20:32.057 --> 01:20:32.857]  They're not after money.
[01:20:32.857 --> 01:20:34.118]  They have all the money they need.
[01:20:34.118 --> 01:20:35.099]  They're after power.
[01:20:35.099 --> 01:20:36.260]  That's what they have to lose here.
[01:20:36.260 --> 01:20:41.023]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[01:20:44.985 --> 01:20:45.726]  Endgame.
[01:20:45.726 --> 01:20:47.787]  Blueprint for global enslaving.
[01:20:47.787 --> 01:20:48.828]  You have been warned.
[01:20:49.729 --> 01:20:51.250]  Attention GCN listeners.
[01:20:51.250 --> 01:20:55.574]  You've all heard of 9-1-1 in plain sight, Beyond Treason, and One Nation Under Siege.
[01:20:55.574 --> 01:20:58.977]  But did you know that all of these documentaries were created by one man?
[01:20:58.977 --> 01:21:01.359]  Civil rights activist and filmmaker William Lewis.
[01:21:01.359 --> 01:21:04.582]  Now Mr. Lewis has produced his most patriotic documentary to date.
[01:21:04.582 --> 01:21:06.424]  A film about taking back our government.
[01:21:06.584 --> 01:21:13.368]  Washington You're Fired was born out of sheer frustration with abuses in our current political system, and it gives a voice to Americans across the country.
[01:21:13.368 --> 01:21:29.417]  Washington You're Fired examines constitutional issues as they relate to the Katrina disaster, the President's illegal spy program, NSA data mining, FISA's secret court, the illegal wiretapping of millions of Americans, and the last seven years of terror-related spy bills, how they affect you, and what you can do about it.
[01:21:29.417 --> 01:21:33.440]  Washington You're Fired captures the spirit and zest of an old-fashioned Boston Tea Party.
[01:21:33.780 --> 01:21:37.521]  Cam Williams describes the film as a rabble-rousing call to arms.
[01:21:37.521 --> 01:21:39.422]  We invite you to make the change with us.
[01:21:39.422 --> 01:21:40.983]  Help take back our government now.

[01:21:49.727 --> 01:21:52.589]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[01:21:52.589 --> 01:21:54.150]  Loose Change Final Cut.
[01:21:54.150 --> 01:21:56.291]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:21:56.291 --> 01:21:58.192]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[01:21:58.192 --> 01:21:59.693]  The late great USA.
[01:21:59.693 --> 01:22:01.454]  America, freedom to fascism.

[01:22:49.804 --> 01:22:51.805]  Alright Dad, let me get this straight.
[01:22:51.805 --> 01:22:53.987]  Uncivil Liberties takes place in the future, right?
[01:22:53.987 --> 01:22:55.008]  Like Star Wars?
[01:22:55.008 --> 01:22:55.848]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:22:55.848 --> 01:22:57.029]  Slightly in the future.
[01:22:57.029 --> 01:22:58.110]  Wait a second.
[01:22:58.110 --> 01:23:01.372]  I thought Star Wars took place a long, long time ago.
[01:23:01.372 --> 01:23:04.614]  Alright Einstein, but it is kind of like Star Wars anyway.
[01:23:04.614 --> 01:23:11.239]  Just like Star Wars, there's an evil empire and some people have started an armed rebellion to fight the evil empire.
[01:23:11.519 --> 01:23:14.900]  Okay, so don't tell me, the government's the bad guys again?
[01:23:14.900 --> 01:23:16.041]  Yep, that's right.
[01:23:16.041 --> 01:23:18.902]  Oh, so your character's like Luke Skywalker?
[01:23:18.902 --> 01:23:19.963]  Not exactly.
[01:23:19.963 --> 01:23:22.084]  I know, you're Chewbacca!
[01:23:22.084 --> 01:23:31.167]  Not really, but my character does help the rebellion to stop the government's evil tracking system, which is happening now in the real world, just like in Uncivil Liberties.
[01:23:31.167 --> 01:23:34.309]  Wait a second, they can't track us, it's a free country!
[01:23:34.309 --> 01:23:34.869]  Exactly.
[01:23:35.876 --> 01:23:36.857]  Uncivil Liberties.

[01:23:50.288 --> 01:24:03.200]  There is a chance for the President of the United States to use this disaster to carry out what his father, a phrase his father used I think only once, and hasn't been used since, and that is a New World Order.
[01:24:04.184 --> 01:24:13.713]  What I have said to you tonight is we do need a new international order unless we want to lose tens of millions of people.
[01:24:13.713 --> 01:24:20.280]  Oh, we're going to lose tens of millions of people unless you give total control to us, unless you let us totally rule your life!
[01:24:21.267 --> 01:24:23.750]  Jonathan Elinoff, great job.
[01:24:23.750 --> 01:24:26.633]  If you guys can send us just the clip of Gary Hart.
[01:24:26.633 --> 01:24:28.415]  I know you've already given us a lot of footage for the new film.
[01:24:28.415 --> 01:24:31.439]  It's going to come out in the next 2-3 months, about 9-11.
[01:24:31.439 --> 01:24:34.102]  Truth, we are changed, the whole movement.
[01:24:34.102 --> 01:24:37.425]  If you can send me that new Hart clip, I have the footage.
[01:24:38.606 --> 01:24:40.368]  Absolutely, we'll send it out right away.
[01:24:40.368 --> 01:24:41.869]  The WeAreChangeColorado.org is our activist front.
[01:25:04.208 --> 01:25:10.777]  And the TruthAlliance.net is basically our journalist front, and we're all members on both.
[01:25:10.777 --> 01:25:14.381]  We basically write on one, and we show all our video clips on the other.
[01:25:14.381 --> 01:25:20.229]  Well, I have to say, We Are Change Colorado is very professional, just really nice, really intelligent people.
[01:25:20.909 --> 01:25:23.613]  I know you guys and gals have invited me out and I've been really flattered.
[01:25:23.613 --> 01:25:32.543]  I've just been so tied down here with work and family and taxes and films that I can hardly get a minute to comb my hair, much less come out there.
[01:25:32.543 --> 01:25:37.369]  But I might come out there for this DNC thing just because it's so evil.
[01:25:38.250 --> 01:25:48.496]  And I need to be on the ground to document the police provocateuring, because the MO you've told me in the documents I've got here, there's no doubt this is a serious operation.
[01:25:48.496 --> 01:25:51.777]  And just by us being there, they may not do it.
[01:25:51.777 --> 01:26:04.424]  Right, and this massive organization, I'm surprised Glenn was basically able to pop up out of nowhere, join in with this old leftover group from the Denver Action Network, which has a bad provocateur past.
[01:26:05.183 --> 01:26:14.954]  And basically they pop up out of nowhere, they get thousands of dollars from around the country, they fly around, start promoting it, and just all this momentum.
[01:26:14.954 --> 01:26:21.801]  They've got porta-potties ordered for the Civic Center Park, they're going to be housing and feeding the homeless, they claim to be busing in 10,000 people.
[01:26:24.090 --> 01:26:27.832]  They don't have anywhere to put them, so they're setting up a tent city at the Civic Center Park.
[01:26:27.832 --> 01:26:29.233]  Yeah, let's be clear.
[01:26:29.233 --> 01:26:37.737]  The group that has groups within it calling for throwing bags of blood on police, they're the ones being given everything by the system.
[01:26:37.737 --> 01:26:41.999]  And then there was a lottery to see who'd get it, and they magically got it.
[01:26:41.999 --> 01:26:45.021]  But also, the Democratic Party got one.
[01:26:45.021 --> 01:26:45.501]  Exactly.
[01:26:45.501 --> 01:26:50.744]  Jenny Anderson, the event director for the DNC Hosting Committee, was granted
[01:26:51.340 --> 01:26:59.288]  The first day of demonstrations, she was granted the entire Civic Center Park, which is just a coincidence, I guess.
[01:26:59.288 --> 01:27:00.289]  And it's just a joke.
[01:27:00.289 --> 01:27:08.398]  I mean, the whole thing just stinks that she gets that, you know, and it's supposed to be a transparent, you know, blind lottery.
[01:27:08.398 --> 01:27:12.522]  There was over 800 people that applied for that to get that park.
[01:27:13.183 --> 01:27:25.694]  And the DNC Hosting Committee gets it, but they've already paid thousands and thousands of dollars to rent out the Six Flags Elitch Gardens, which is right next door to Elitch Gardens downtown Denver, for their big kickoff party.
[01:27:25.694 --> 01:27:27.255]  So what do they need the Civic Center Park for?
[01:27:27.255 --> 01:27:29.337]  Which, by the way, is public property.
[01:27:29.337 --> 01:27:32.780]  You can't... The whole thing doesn't make any sense.
[01:27:32.780 --> 01:27:34.521]  It doesn't make any sense.
[01:27:34.521 --> 01:27:34.861]  At all.
[01:27:34.861 --> 01:27:36.603]  Not to be in the nowhere up and down.
[01:27:38.315 --> 01:27:41.157]  Jonathan, I appreciate you and We Are Change Colorado's work.
[01:27:41.157 --> 01:27:53.909]  Please fire off that Gary Hart video with him denying he ever said it and saying it's not true, because I'm definitely going to put that in the new film, which I can tell you the name of it, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:27:53.909 --> 01:27:54.950]  It is 9-11 Chronicles.
[01:27:58.112 --> 01:28:01.075]  And then we're going to call it Truth Revolution or Truth Rising Part 1.
[01:28:01.075 --> 01:28:05.259]  9-11 Chronicles Part 1, Truth Rising or Truth Revolution.
[01:28:05.259 --> 01:28:10.103]  I'm not sure yet, but we're right down to the wire on that and we're pretty much at picture lock.
[01:28:10.103 --> 01:28:13.546]  We're adding in the lower thirds and things, but that is so important.
[01:28:13.546 --> 01:28:22.675]  We're also going to be adding the new thing that Luke got a few days ago with, and I appreciate her finally being truthful, the lady from Democracy Now!
[01:28:23.962 --> 01:28:28.445]  Finally coming out and saying Building 7 should be investigated, that it's suspicious.
[01:28:28.445 --> 01:28:31.966]  So, Amy Goodman, I mean, the cover-up is really starting to implode.
[01:28:31.966 --> 01:28:37.710]  Yeah, it's excellent work that's being done in the We Are Change movement, no question about it.
[01:28:37.710 --> 01:28:43.133]  Well, Jonathan, we've got a few months before the DNC, so we'll have you on way before then to keep up the good work.
[01:28:43.133 --> 01:28:44.594]  Yes, sir, Alex.
[01:28:44.594 --> 01:28:48.816]  Yeah, it's a rigged deal there in, um, Colorado.
[01:28:49.528 --> 01:28:53.014]  Very corrupt, the military, it's a liberal state.
[01:28:53.014 --> 01:28:54.657]  But it's not.
[01:28:54.657 --> 01:28:58.343]  It's the seat of the real government, the shadow government.
[01:28:58.343 --> 01:28:59.104]  And everybody knows.
[01:29:01.235 --> 01:29:02.296]  They're running a major scam.
[01:29:02.296 --> 01:29:02.857]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:40.490 --> 01:29:44.414]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:29:44.414 --> 01:29:47.136]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:30:38.780 --> 01:30:42.001]  Why does our government not allow this crop to grow in the U.S.?
[01:30:42.001 --> 01:30:44.542]  This product is also great for pets and animals.

[01:32:43.564 --> 01:32:43.844]  That's 646-498-5309.
[01:32:43.844 --> 01:32:44.404]  Well, what's this?
[01:33:41.740 --> 01:33:45.704]  But there's no such thing as a New World Order.
[01:33:51.633 --> 01:33:55.255]  Yeah, Gary Hart says he never called for a new world order either.
[01:33:55.255 --> 01:34:00.478]  It's just not true.
[01:34:00.478 --> 01:34:05.020]  Everything must go.
[01:34:05.020 --> 01:34:12.404]  That was the cover of the Austin American Statesman Life and Arts section back on March 30th, 2008.
[01:34:15.498 --> 01:34:19.902]  I guess that was 17 days ago, and I got a few phone calls about this.
[01:34:19.902 --> 01:34:30.972]  My friend Steve Mason called, freaking out, saying, do you know who University of Texas Senior Fellow Philip Bombut is?
[01:34:30.972 --> 01:34:34.295]  And I said, yeah, I know who he is.
[01:34:34.295 --> 01:34:35.295]  We've gone and covered him.
[01:34:35.295 --> 01:34:39.019]  He's a high-level strategist for the New World Order.
[01:34:39.019 --> 01:34:41.381]  I read his book, The Shield of Achilles.
[01:34:43.706 --> 01:34:48.288]  Which we covered here and shot video of some of the meetings he had a few years ago.
[01:34:48.288 --> 01:34:49.748]  And he said, well, you gotta read this.
[01:34:49.748 --> 01:34:51.089]  Well, I didn't read it.
[01:34:51.089 --> 01:34:52.589]  It was a few days after.
[01:34:52.589 --> 01:34:53.770]  I didn't have the paper.
[01:34:53.770 --> 01:34:59.892]  He showed up Monday night at the TV studio and brought me a copy.
[01:34:59.892 --> 01:35:01.233]  And I appreciate him doing that.
[01:35:01.233 --> 01:35:03.153]  I mean, I need to be reminded of things.
[01:35:03.153 --> 01:35:05.614]  I can't keep track of one-tenth of what's happening.
[01:35:05.614 --> 01:35:10.056]  There's so much evil, so many admissions, so many things going on, and there are
[01:35:11.454 --> 01:35:38.509]  Tens of thousands of magazine articles, books, periodicals that have been written in the last decade, tens of thousands in the last hundred years, where they say they're going to get rid of the Bill of Rights and Constitution, where they say they're going to hand all power over to select corporations and a global government, but rarely do they do it in the newspaper.
[01:35:40.131 --> 01:35:41.492]  It's in periodicals.
[01:35:41.492 --> 01:35:43.814]  It's in scholarly works.
[01:35:43.814 --> 01:35:47.156]  It's in textbooks.
[01:35:47.156 --> 01:35:48.537]  It's in quarterly reports.
[01:35:48.537 --> 01:35:49.938]  It's in governmental reports.
[01:35:49.938 --> 01:35:52.560]  It's in think tank reports.
[01:35:52.560 --> 01:36:03.667]  This was the front page of a section of the Statesman, and I showed it yesterday on the fourth hour where we turned this into a TV program, Radio Simulcast, for PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[01:36:03.667 --> 01:36:05.749]  I showed it, but now we've scanned it in
[01:36:06.591 --> 01:36:11.133]  And put it up in stories that Paul Watson wrote and that Kurt Nemo have written as well.
[01:36:11.133 --> 01:36:12.714]  He's done something on it.
[01:36:12.714 --> 01:36:21.817]  Neocons call for shredding Constitution, imposing world government.
[01:36:21.817 --> 01:36:28.960]  And you can go up to PrisonPlanet.com and look at it.
[01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:30.201]  We've got a scan in there.
[01:36:32.003 --> 01:36:37.006]  If you go to JonesReport.com, Aaron's actually got a big scan of it.
[01:36:37.006 --> 01:36:37.967]  This is a little scan.
[01:36:37.967 --> 01:36:42.770]  I want you to be able to read the fine print on it of the actual news story, not just Paul's story about it.
[01:36:42.770 --> 01:36:49.614]  In fact, let's tell Paul to put a link to the high-res one in there if we can.
[01:36:49.614 --> 01:36:56.178]  Everything must go, and on the front of it, it's got a copy of the Declaration of Independence.
[01:36:56.178 --> 01:36:56.919]  We the people.
[01:36:58.200 --> 01:37:02.663]  And the Constitution has been ripped in half and it's got a burned edge.
[01:37:02.663 --> 01:37:14.650]  And because it's been gotten out of the way, because it has been removed, you see how to fight terrorism.
[01:37:14.650 --> 01:37:20.934]  And then it goes on to say, you know, a program to keep Americans safe.
[01:37:20.934 --> 01:37:21.975]  It's like Gary Hart said.
[01:37:21.975 --> 01:37:24.857]  He said, you either let us have a world government
[01:37:26.619 --> 01:37:31.603]  Or tens of millions are gonna die, and that's really a true statement.
[01:37:31.603 --> 01:37:37.168]  They're gonna kill tens of millions to get it, and then they're gonna kill billions after they get it.
[01:37:37.168 --> 01:37:41.651]  So, uh, when they... I mean, these are men who are all about having power.
[01:37:41.651 --> 01:37:44.313]  They're all about really having real power.
[01:37:44.313 --> 01:37:48.737]  And they're about doing the things that it takes to get it and maintain it.
[01:37:48.737 --> 01:37:49.678]  And they're a different elk.
[01:37:49.678 --> 01:37:52.620]  They see us as weak.
[01:37:52.620 --> 01:37:55.022]  You know, I talk about some child dying of a brain tumor.
[01:37:55.888 --> 01:37:58.810]  And I don't even know the child, but it makes me sad and upset.
[01:37:58.810 --> 01:38:00.011]  To them, that means absolutely nothing.
[01:38:00.011 --> 01:38:03.553]  These are cold-blooded individuals.
[01:38:03.553 --> 01:38:13.000]  And everything is about how to manipulate you, and you read this article where they say everything must go, get rid of the Constitution, Bill of Rights, sovereignty.
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:22.807]  It's a bunch of nonsensical hyperbole wrapped up in an intellectual bow, and then everyone I've been to these meetings these guys are at, they just fawn around them.
[01:38:23.743 --> 01:38:28.265]  You know, just other professors fawning, going, you're such a genius.
[01:38:28.265 --> 01:38:35.088]  And they all affect eastern accents and go, oh no, hmm, hmm, hmm.
[01:38:35.088 --> 01:38:38.329]  And it's just sick.
[01:38:38.329 --> 01:38:41.690]  These are sick, sick people.
[01:38:41.690 --> 01:38:43.371]  And so they're the good guys.
[01:38:43.371 --> 01:38:44.872]  Burn the Constitution.
[01:38:44.872 --> 01:38:47.333]  Get rid of what this country stands for.
[01:38:47.333 --> 01:38:48.313]  That's a good thing.
[01:38:48.313 --> 01:38:52.875]  That is the image on the front and what they say in words on the cover of the story.
[01:38:57.099 --> 01:39:02.780]  Then you open up the story and you begin to read it.
[01:39:02.780 --> 01:39:09.001]  Amend the UN Charter to allow the preemptive use of force without a Security Council authorization.
[01:39:09.001 --> 01:39:21.544]  So, allow the global government's plaything, their debating circle, the UN, runs nothing, its Security Council runs it all, to just say, yeah, we attack who we want first, when we want.
[01:39:22.521 --> 01:39:29.063]  So, legalizing what's always been known as Hitlerian or Stalinistic.
[01:39:29.063 --> 01:39:30.584]  Now, here's where it gets really deceptive, though.
[01:39:30.584 --> 01:39:36.146]  I mean, this is written very deceptively in a very twisted way.
[01:39:36.146 --> 01:39:39.467]  You know you're dealing with an operative.
[01:39:39.467 --> 01:39:43.148]  I mean, he's definitely a fellow traveler for world government and elitism.
[01:39:43.148 --> 01:39:45.809]  But the writer of this, I want to get him on, James E. McWilliams.
[01:39:47.799 --> 01:39:54.062]  Guarantee you get this guy on the phone and he'll tell my producer, No, I don't wish to come home with Mr. Jones.
[01:39:54.062 --> 01:39:55.403]  He's beneath me.
[01:39:55.403 --> 01:40:00.226]  And I'm just in love with myself.
[01:40:00.226 --> 01:40:01.607]  No, you guys aren't smart.
[01:40:01.607 --> 01:40:02.947]  What you are is cancer.
[01:40:02.947 --> 01:40:05.189]  You're willing to do things normal people aren't.
[01:40:05.189 --> 01:40:07.190]  That's why you're in control.
[01:40:07.190 --> 01:40:11.872]  Period.
[01:40:11.872 --> 01:40:14.074]  Let me just get into it.
[01:40:14.074 --> 01:40:16.595]  This is like taking a beating to read this because it makes me so mad.
[01:40:18.496 --> 01:40:22.358]  Now this is where it starts getting really deceptive.
[01:40:22.358 --> 01:40:31.303]  Change the Geneva Conventions to forbid the indefinite confinement of terrorist prisoners without trial.
[01:40:31.303 --> 01:40:37.026]  Now, the Geneva Convention says you can't hold somebody without charging them a week.
[01:40:37.026 --> 01:40:44.430]  Pabeus corpus, basic Magna Carta, basic English, Anglo-Saxon common law.
[01:40:44.430 --> 01:40:45.691]  Same things in the Mosaic Law.
[01:40:46.883 --> 01:40:51.025]  Just ancient, common law, basic common sense.
[01:40:51.025 --> 01:40:56.148]  Before we had lawyers like this to twist everything for us.
[01:40:56.148 --> 01:41:01.951]  Now, when you read it, it says they can't hold you a week without charges.
[01:41:01.951 --> 01:41:04.853]  They must bring charges, they must say what the crime is.
[01:41:04.853 --> 01:41:11.436]  But this is written to where you'd think, oh, absolutely, the UN shouldn't be able to keep you forever.
[01:41:11.436 --> 01:41:16.359]  You know, they should only be able to hold you without trial for 20 years, as Bobbitt calls for in the book.
[01:41:18.382 --> 01:41:21.864]  Kind of like Slobodan Milošević was in there 8 years and they poisoned him to death.
[01:41:21.864 --> 01:41:24.965]  They admitted he was poisoned to death at the UN building.
[01:41:24.965 --> 01:41:30.368]  He was bringing up the fact that it was all staged and the US attacked first and used Al-Qaeda to attack Serbia.
[01:41:30.368 --> 01:41:31.949]  And so they just killed him.
[01:41:31.949 --> 01:41:35.931]  And he said they poisoned him and he said they poisoned me and they made me take some pills.
[01:41:35.931 --> 01:41:40.273]  And then he was so strong he didn't die and they went back in and poisoned him again and he was dead later.
[01:41:40.273 --> 01:41:42.454]  I mean, you could even be saying they're murdering me!
[01:41:42.454 --> 01:41:44.695]  So tough he could still fight through it, it didn't matter.
[01:41:53.603 --> 01:42:03.130]  Poisoning within a very exotic poison, too, that takes a lot of to kill you.
[01:42:03.130 --> 01:42:05.612]  So change the Geneva Conventions to forbid.
[01:42:05.612 --> 01:42:06.792]  Oh, it forbids!
[01:42:06.792 --> 01:42:08.874]  The average yuppies at home thinking they know it all.
[01:42:08.874 --> 01:42:12.937]  Oh, it forbids indefinite confinement of terrorists without trial.
[01:42:16.414 --> 01:42:25.478]  You see, that's meant for the average weak-minded person who thinks they're smart to go, oh, well, it's forbidding indefinite confinement.
[01:42:25.478 --> 01:42:29.080]  But then when you know the Geneva Convention, it says you can't have indefinite confinement.
[01:42:29.080 --> 01:42:32.741]  So see, this is saying, change it to where we can only hold you 20 years.
[01:42:32.741 --> 01:42:37.704]  See that lawyer strategia, that mind game trick there?
[01:42:37.704 --> 01:42:39.324]  Oh, and it gets fathomless how bad it is.
[01:42:41.664 --> 01:42:46.872]  Allow a more invasive process of information gathering within and across national borders.
[01:42:46.872 --> 01:42:50.257]  And he calls for total surveillance watching everyone know Fourth Amendment.
[01:42:50.257 --> 01:42:51.098]  In the book.
[01:42:51.098 --> 01:42:51.219]  So.
[01:42:52.719 --> 01:42:55.160]  Preemptively attack people for no reason whenever you want.
[01:42:55.160 --> 01:42:56.480]  Spy on everybody.
[01:42:56.480 --> 01:42:58.281]  Secretly arrest you and hold you.
[01:42:58.281 --> 01:43:01.182]  Because this son of a bitch isn't going to get away with what he's doing.
[01:43:01.182 --> 01:43:01.942]  They're starting to lose.
[01:43:01.942 --> 01:43:18.107]  They're not going to be able to have their way and take all our bank accounts and rule over us and have one in ten being a Homeland Security graduate from college and spies everywhere in an East German nightmare with these pieces of filth at the top of it and their ivory towers on power trips unless they're able to come and arrest me!
[01:43:18.107 --> 01:43:20.647]  And you.
[01:43:20.647 --> 01:43:22.528]  Bobbitt, you know you're going to jail, don't you?
[01:43:23.621 --> 01:43:24.762]  We're going to take this country back.
[01:43:24.762 --> 01:43:29.524]  A lot of us won't live to see it, but you are going to spend time in prison, boy.
[01:43:29.524 --> 01:43:37.368]  When the use of non-lethal chemical weapons can be used to prevent terror, prevent, preemptive, redefine such methods as counterforce measures.
[01:43:37.368 --> 01:43:43.172]  And then he goes in the book about basically knocking out populations, gassing populations.
[01:43:43.172 --> 01:43:44.012]  Every major U.S.
[01:43:44.012 --> 01:43:51.236]  city, we learned this in what, 2002, since the mid-90s has had helicopters inside facilities
[01:43:52.154 --> 01:43:57.417]  Loaded with opiate knockout gas canisters to spray and knock out whole U.S.
[01:43:57.417 --> 01:43:58.678]  cities.
[01:43:58.678 --> 01:44:07.243]  And they predict that in a medium-sized city, you'll have more than 10,000 deaths because you'll have car wrecks, fires, people falling and hitting their heads.
[01:44:07.243 --> 01:44:09.104]  I mean, this knocks you out instantly.
[01:44:09.104 --> 01:44:12.906]  And they've got helicopters ready with knockout gas everywhere for you and your family.
[01:44:12.906 --> 01:44:17.588]  Adelaide Cheney says, legitimize the use of race-specific bioweapons to kill certain races.
[01:44:17.588 --> 01:44:18.589]  That's in public documents.
[01:44:20.942 --> 01:44:24.404]  September 2000, PNAC, we're building America's defenses.
[01:44:24.404 --> 01:44:29.047]  There, I even gave you the date of the document, so you can't be lazy and say it doesn't exist.
[01:44:29.047 --> 01:44:42.975]  These, I mean, when they're writing memos saying, torture children sexually, and giving it to the military and nobody gets in trouble, we're one minute to midnight here.
[01:44:42.975 --> 01:44:50.019]  When they're putting the Constitution, being ripped apart, saying it's good, with an image of it, and saying, get rid of it, on the front of the paper,
[01:44:50.976 --> 01:44:53.777]  We're in deep trouble.
[01:44:53.777 --> 01:44:59.098]  When they're saying, hey, we want to indefinitely arrest people, whoever we want, we're in trouble.
[01:44:59.098 --> 01:45:06.761]  These guys let you know who they are, because they think, the behavioral psychologists know that the majority of people now have no moral compass.
[01:45:06.761 --> 01:45:09.241]  They're just, whatever they're told is normal, they go with.
[01:45:09.241 --> 01:45:11.662]  I mean, if they told the attendees that, uh,
[01:45:12.748 --> 01:45:16.891]  Eating dead dog rotten roadkill was a delicacy and would make them look beautiful?
[01:45:16.891 --> 01:45:22.675]  You'd have beautiful women lined up at shops paying hundreds of dollars per pound for rotten roadkill.
[01:45:22.675 --> 01:45:25.437]  And I'm not being sarcastic.
[01:45:25.437 --> 01:45:26.678]  They don't have compasses.
[01:45:26.678 --> 01:45:32.562]  They don't have a heart, a soul that everything else orbits around.
[01:45:32.562 --> 01:45:39.267]  They're different every day.
[01:45:39.267 --> 01:45:41.128]  And so that's who they're programming.
[01:45:41.128 --> 01:45:41.749]  And let me tell you,
[01:45:42.532 --> 01:45:47.977]  People in Austin opened their newspapers up and they read this and most of them said, well, he's an esteemed person.
[01:45:47.977 --> 01:45:50.759]  He's in a fancy suit.
[01:45:50.759 --> 01:45:54.062]  He's a big top, you know, strategic planner.
[01:45:54.062 --> 01:45:55.223]  Must be true.
[01:45:55.223 --> 01:45:59.087]  We've got to go along with it now.
[01:45:59.087 --> 01:46:05.572]  When the use of non-lethal chemical weapons can be used to prevent terror, redefine such methods as counterforce measures.
[01:46:05.572 --> 01:46:05.913]  You know what?
[01:46:05.913 --> 01:46:07.354]  I can't find it in my stack, Aaron.
[01:46:08.894 --> 01:46:16.679]  Will you dig out that Washington Post article about the government wants to wrap its mind around yours?
[01:46:16.679 --> 01:46:18.099]  I just, I looked for it some this morning.
[01:46:18.099 --> 01:46:19.100]  I couldn't find it in my stack.
[01:46:19.100 --> 01:46:22.562]  Then it was, I was out of time to find it, and I don't want to read off the computer screen.
[01:46:22.562 --> 01:46:28.946]  I don't news read well off a screen, so just, yeah, just print off that, uh, Washington Post, government wants to wrap its mind around yours.
[01:46:28.946 --> 01:46:34.309]  I've been trying to cover it since Sunday, and I'm just gonna, I was gonna have a guest on next hour, but I'm just gonna go ahead and cover that next hour.
[01:46:34.309 --> 01:46:35.429]  It's so important.
[01:46:35.429 --> 01:46:36.510]  And we'll take some of your calls, too.
[01:46:42.065 --> 01:46:43.325]  Now, let me go ahead and get into this now.
[01:46:43.325 --> 01:46:44.666]  I'll finish reading it.
[01:46:44.666 --> 01:46:51.288]  The article begins with the average weak-minded person thinking, oh, this is going to not... this is very liberal.
[01:46:51.288 --> 01:46:54.750]  This will stop indefinite imprisonment.
[01:46:54.750 --> 01:46:56.130]  When it actually allows it.
[01:46:56.130 --> 01:47:00.012]  Because if they can hold you for 20, they can hold you for 30.
[01:47:00.012 --> 01:47:00.552]  It doesn't matter.
[01:47:00.552 --> 01:47:11.556]  A UT senior fellow, Philip Bombut, argues that we will have to abandon our military and constitutional traditions if we want to survive this perilous century.
[01:47:12.813 --> 01:47:13.914]  That's right!
[01:47:13.914 --> 01:47:18.338]  Abandon our constitutional... It's not just traditions, buddy.
[01:47:18.338 --> 01:47:24.623]  Like you traditionally go to the first ball game of your favorite baseball team.
[01:47:24.623 --> 01:47:26.965]  You traditionally eat a hot dog with sauerkraut.
[01:47:26.965 --> 01:47:27.745]  This isn't that.
[01:47:27.745 --> 01:47:28.966]  This is our country.
[01:47:28.966 --> 01:47:30.187]  This is why we're different.
[01:47:30.187 --> 01:47:32.009]  This is why we became so successful.
[01:47:32.009 --> 01:47:32.269]  Because
[01:47:33.135 --> 01:47:44.786]  Corrupt people in government couldn't suck off the general population and a middle class exploded, and we had 15% growth rates for most of a hundred years, till you people took over.
[01:47:44.786 --> 01:47:48.670]  Parasites!
[01:47:48.670 --> 01:47:55.076]  So no, we don't need to get rid of our traditions, our laws, that you flagrantly violate everywhere.
[01:47:58.456 --> 01:48:03.119]  Now treason is defined as treason against the Constitution Bill of Rights by people in positions of power.
[01:48:03.119 --> 01:48:04.981]  This is a policy maker.
[01:48:04.981 --> 01:48:06.682]  He writes the policies that are adopted.
[01:48:06.682 --> 01:48:09.304]  This is treason.
[01:48:09.304 --> 01:48:13.287]  The difference between free speech and treason.
[01:48:13.287 --> 01:48:21.913]  When you argue against the fundamental Bill of Rights and Constitution from a position of power and talk about depriving people of their rights, you have become a tyrant.
[01:48:29.051 --> 01:48:30.772]  See how every line is pure evil?
[01:48:30.772 --> 01:48:32.173]  I've only gotten through like six lines.
[01:48:32.173 --> 01:48:33.314]  Let me read that again.
[01:48:33.314 --> 01:48:41.399]  UT senior fellow Philip Bobbitt argues that we'll have to abandon our military and constitutional traditions if we want to survive this perilous journey.
[01:48:41.399 --> 01:48:44.641]  What did Gary Hart say threatening the students?
[01:48:44.641 --> 01:48:51.766]  You better go along with the world government or tens of millions are gonna die.
[01:48:51.766 --> 01:48:54.108]  From Al-Qaeda, yes, yes.
[01:48:55.493 --> 01:49:09.439]  James E. McWilliams writes this fawning, simpering, disgusting article talking about how smart fawning over Bobbitt's intelligence.
[01:49:09.439 --> 01:49:12.660]  This isn't an intelligent treatise for tyranny.
[01:49:12.660 --> 01:49:20.363]  You ought to read Julius Caesar's articles on why he needed total power.
[01:49:21.371 --> 01:49:28.655]  To protect the liberty, and protect the freedom, and for the greater good of Rome, because they were under such threat, and blah blah blah.
[01:49:28.655 --> 01:49:30.676]  They don't even do that!
[01:49:30.676 --> 01:49:33.277]  They just come right out and say, let's burn the Constitution.
[01:49:33.277 --> 01:49:37.740]  See, they're getting you ready for that.
[01:49:37.740 --> 01:49:40.321]  I mean, there were behavioral psychologists that gave the okay on this.
[01:49:40.321 --> 01:49:42.542]  You can be guaranteed on that.
[01:49:42.542 --> 01:49:48.085]  During the course of a long, intellectually demanding narrative, terror and consent, see,
[01:49:49.031 --> 01:49:53.614]  Just like they claim, oh, well, the police asked to come in your house and confiscate your guns, and then you consent.
[01:49:53.614 --> 01:50:02.020]  Or, oh, well, you don't have to take shots, but we have police dogs out, and we say on the news you'll be arrested if you don't take shots, but you consented.
[01:50:02.020 --> 01:50:07.424]  We had consent forms on a table over here that nobody was allowed to have access to.
[01:50:07.424 --> 01:50:08.925]  You consented.
[01:50:08.925 --> 01:50:15.810]  And he goes on to say in here that the corporations will decide what we do, and that NGOs will represent the people.
[01:50:16.500 --> 01:50:22.724]  Non-governmental organizations funded and run by the corporations.
[01:50:22.724 --> 01:50:25.605]  Oh, I am going to read this entire article when we get back.
[01:50:25.605 --> 01:50:29.148]  If it takes 20 minutes, then I'm going to get into the financial news.
[01:50:29.148 --> 01:50:36.252]  Then I'm going to take your phone calls from the bottom of the next hour all the way through the fourth hour.
[01:50:36.252 --> 01:50:36.572]  Okay?
[01:50:38.652 --> 01:50:44.913]  We're going to cover it all today, but this is important to understand the mindset of our enemies.

[01:54:00.771 --> 01:54:22.152]  What you got is a bunch of wannabe dictators working for the big banking cartel that owns the military-industrial complex, who just decided to shove us around like a bunch of third-world slaves, arrogantly walking around, so arrogant, writing memos about torturing children sexually and burning the Constitution, telling us they're good guys.
[01:54:25.091 --> 01:54:34.373]  I mean, they might start dressing up in red pajamas with horns and a pitchfork and say, hey, I'm the good guy, let's party!
[01:54:34.373 --> 01:54:41.695]  The good guy doesn't wear red pajamas and have a tail.
[01:54:41.695 --> 01:54:46.076]  The good guy doesn't write memos about torturing toddlers with pliers.
[01:54:46.076 --> 01:54:51.077]  And I've had enough of all this scum.
[01:54:51.077 --> 01:54:53.958]  But we're a country that thinks 50 million abortions is good, so what do you expect?
[01:54:56.508 --> 01:55:04.274]  Continuing here, UT senior fellow Philip Bobbitt argues that we'll have to abandon our military and constitutional traditions if we want to survive.
[01:55:04.274 --> 01:55:05.155]  Oh, survive!
[01:55:05.155 --> 01:55:06.636]  Al-Qaeda!
[01:55:06.636 --> 01:55:08.938]  This perilous century.
[01:55:08.938 --> 01:55:13.522]  During the course of a long, intellectually demanding narrative, this is how the article starts.
[01:55:13.522 --> 01:55:16.844]  Oh, oh, see, it's so intellectually demanding.
[01:55:16.844 --> 01:55:21.108]  See, every line is laced with dripping with poisonous propaganda.
[01:55:21.108 --> 01:55:24.891]  So someone reading this thinks, oh, to understand this, I have to be very intellectual.
[01:55:25.566 --> 01:55:34.753]  Which means an average person reads this and knows it's a bunch of tyranny, but they say, oh no, you have to stress yourself to understand it.
[01:55:34.753 --> 01:55:41.297]  During the course of a long, intellectually demanding narrative, terror and consent pivots on several paradigm-shifting claims.
[01:55:41.297 --> 01:55:48.362]  One of them, which appears in the introduction, stands out for its humanitarian implications.
[01:55:48.362 --> 01:55:54.507]  During the era of the 20th century industrial nation-states, 80% of the dead and wounded in warfare were civilians.
[01:55:57.299 --> 01:56:00.002]  We've had nation-states for thousands of years.
[01:56:00.002 --> 01:56:02.584]  They've always had huge wars.
[01:56:02.584 --> 01:56:09.871]  It's modern weapons that caused 80% of the casualties to be civilians.
[01:56:09.871 --> 01:56:15.976]  So, the implication is nation-states kill civilians and kill large numbers of people.
[01:56:15.976 --> 01:56:19.820]  Intellectually bankrupt, a fraud, a lie has no connection to it.
[01:56:21.269 --> 01:56:24.851]  Except they would argue, well, nation-states fight with each other, so a world government would stop that.
[01:56:24.851 --> 01:56:26.432]  But that's a fraud as well.
[01:56:26.432 --> 01:56:30.634]  The point is, they hand out weapons to de-stabilize, so they can take over.
[01:56:30.634 --> 01:56:40.719]  But the fraudulent statement here is meant to say 80% of the casualties were caused by the modern nation-states, when it was the modern weapons that did that.
[01:56:40.719 --> 01:56:41.700]  Nothing to do with the state.
[01:56:42.751 --> 01:56:56.942]  For Philip Bobbitt, a distinguished and distinguished lecturer and senior fellow at the University of Texas and law professor at Columbia University, this is more than a gee whiz factoid.
[01:56:56.942 --> 01:57:09.131]  It's the basis upon which he advocates an ambitious argument for fighting the wars that are bound to plague the 21st century.
[01:57:09.131 --> 01:57:12.254]  The prospect, because you see we're going to have
[01:57:15.762 --> 01:57:19.946]  We're going to have this dangerous, the war of the 21st century.
[01:57:19.946 --> 01:57:26.971]  Which if you read actually what the Pentagon says, the Ministry of Defense say, they say it's war against individuals, mopping up and enslaving the population.
[01:57:26.971 --> 01:57:30.695]  I mean, go read the new Ministry of Defense report last year out of England.
[01:57:30.695 --> 01:57:33.497]  They just say point blank, government's against the people.
[01:57:33.497 --> 01:57:44.046]  The prospect that the good old industrial nation-state is a shrinking of the good old, see, oh it's bygone, it's old, but what they're replacing it with is the ancient imperial model,
[01:57:45.768 --> 01:57:54.612]  Run by a group of technocrats with a penchant for eugenics and sadistic, psychopathic behavior.
[01:57:54.612 --> 01:57:56.573]  See how that's propaganda?
[01:57:56.573 --> 01:58:00.755]  The prospect of the good, old, industrial nation-state.
[01:58:00.755 --> 01:58:07.058]  See, globalism destroys your industry and then they say, oh, look, the nation-state, the industrial nation-state failed you.
[01:58:07.058 --> 01:58:09.719]  Then they blame it on nationalism.
[01:58:09.719 --> 01:58:12.400]  See, it's always they create the crisis, I'm the solution.
[01:58:12.400 --> 01:58:13.381]  We're going to continue here.
[01:58:15.037 --> 01:58:17.619]  I'm going to read the whole article and analyze it.
[01:58:17.619 --> 01:58:24.765]  Then we're going to get into how you're going to be guilty, not until proven innocent, but guilty period under pre-crime laws.
[01:58:24.765 --> 01:58:28.528]  They're building lots of prisons and they're for you, the milk cows.
[01:58:28.528 --> 01:58:35.214]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:58:44.956 --> 01:58:49.861]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:58:49.861 --> 01:58:52.683]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:58:52.683 --> 01:58:55.486]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:58:55.486 --> 01:58:58.669]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:58:58.669 --> 01:59:05.977]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.

[01:59:22.057 --> 01:59:22.837]  They're not after money.
[01:59:22.837 --> 01:59:24.118]  They have all the money they need.
[01:59:24.118 --> 01:59:25.099]  They're after power.
[01:59:25.099 --> 01:59:26.240]  That's what they're after these years.

[01:59:45.331 --> 01:59:54.716]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:59:54.716 --> 01:59:56.476]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:56.476 --> 01:59:58.077]  You want answers?
[01:59:58.077 --> 01:59:59.018]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:59.018 --> 02:00:03.800]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:03.800 --> 02:00:07.882]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:10.513 --> 02:00:11.014]  Yeah.
[02:00:26.505 --> 02:00:27.766]  Alright, now into hour number three.
[02:00:27.766 --> 02:00:29.206]  Don't worry, hour number four is coming up.
[02:00:29.206 --> 02:00:33.308]  I'll be taking your calls at the end of this hour and the entire fourth hour.
[02:00:33.308 --> 02:00:34.529]  Nothing but your phone calls.
[02:00:34.529 --> 02:00:37.810]  I got some financial news, military news coming up.
[02:00:37.810 --> 02:00:53.097]  Paul Watson has written an excellent article at PrisonPlanet.com that needs to get out, where they show the Constitution being destroyed and say everything must go, and then they just say it's quaint and stupid and old and bad and will get you and your family killed.
[02:00:54.750 --> 02:00:55.451]  Yeah.
[02:00:55.451 --> 02:00:57.533]  Aren't you worried about the boys that run our military?
[02:00:57.533 --> 02:00:58.533]  Boys that own the banks?
[02:00:58.533 --> 02:01:05.480]  Boys that got all the power that'll destroy third world countries that have been caught sterilizing people and killing them worldwide?
[02:01:05.480 --> 02:01:06.821]  You like them having unlimited power?
[02:01:06.821 --> 02:01:07.441]  You think that's good?
[02:01:07.441 --> 02:01:08.923]  Are you really worried about cave dwellers?
[02:01:08.923 --> 02:01:10.804]  I mean, even if you believe the official story?
[02:01:10.804 --> 02:01:11.785]  You want to give up everything?
[02:01:11.785 --> 02:01:14.087]  Everything you've got?
[02:01:14.087 --> 02:01:14.868]  Your free market?
[02:01:14.868 --> 02:01:15.529]  Your country?
[02:01:15.529 --> 02:01:15.889]  Everything?
[02:01:15.889 --> 02:01:18.331]  Because you're so afraid of Al-Qaeda.
[02:01:18.331 --> 02:01:19.232]  Just so sick.
[02:01:21.229 --> 02:01:29.213]  For Philip Bobbitt, a distinguished lecturer and senior fellow at the University of Texas and law professor at Columbia University, this is more than a gee-whiz factoid.
[02:01:29.213 --> 02:01:36.537]  It's the basis upon which he advises an ambitious argument for fighting the wars that are bound to plague the 21st century.
[02:01:36.537 --> 02:01:46.403]  We explain that's why they stage World War I and World War II in their own documents, as Lord Milner wrote, that they wanted to set up a world government, and said, oh, we can't have any more wars.
[02:01:46.403 --> 02:01:48.964]  Same trick they play on us, trick seems to work.
[02:01:49.665 --> 02:01:52.888]  Well, now the people don't want it, so they just say they're militarizing everything.
[02:01:52.888 --> 02:01:55.091]  If you don't like it, we'll just shove a gun down your throat and pull the trigger.
[02:01:55.091 --> 02:01:55.751]  How's that sound?
[02:01:55.751 --> 02:01:57.573]  Bobbitt says.
[02:01:57.573 --> 02:02:08.564]  The prospect that the good old industrial nation-state is shrinking violent might rankle patriotic flag-wavers, but Bobbitt's statistic thrust home an unsettling question.
[02:02:08.564 --> 02:02:09.806]  Oh, he's got statistics.
[02:02:09.806 --> 02:02:11.167]  You have nothing.
[02:02:11.167 --> 02:02:11.848]  It's all crap.
[02:02:12.751 --> 02:02:17.395]  What does it say about the nation-state that he has so often failed to provide?
[02:02:17.395 --> 02:02:20.458]  Oh, the nation-state didn't provide it.
[02:02:20.458 --> 02:02:21.399]  It messed up.
[02:02:21.399 --> 02:02:24.261]  It was bad.
[02:02:24.261 --> 02:02:28.785]  What does it say that the nation-state has that has so often failed to provide?
[02:02:28.785 --> 02:02:35.771]  In the words of British statesman Douglas Heard, the security, prosperity, and the decent environment which the citizens demand.
[02:02:35.771 --> 02:02:37.493]  Might it be time for something new?
[02:02:38.453 --> 02:02:43.078]  And then he goes on to propose no Bill of Rights, no Constitution, no due process, preemptive war.
[02:02:43.078 --> 02:02:45.982]  Oh, that's wonderful!
[02:02:45.982 --> 02:02:51.408]  With a bunch of crooks running it, banning protests and banning free speech and face-scanning cameras.
[02:02:51.408 --> 02:02:52.469]  Oh, yes, Bobbitt!
[02:02:52.469 --> 02:02:57.555]  And CPS-ing people's children and hiring more CPS with the money they get and then hiring more.
[02:02:58.644 --> 02:03:02.707]  In Bobbitt's view, the current wars against terror provide a shrill wake-up call.
[02:03:02.707 --> 02:03:04.889]  See, they're not working well, so we need more.
[02:03:04.889 --> 02:03:17.079]  To confront the question, the best way to protect citizens of modern democracies, he claims, is to fundamentally rethink the nation-state as the guarantor of freedoms that terrorists intend to obliterate.
[02:03:17.079 --> 02:03:22.744]  So, he's saying, we need to get rid of the nation-state because the terrorists want to obliterate the nation-state.
[02:03:22.744 --> 02:03:25.847]  Or, we need to give up our liberties because the terrorists want our liberties.
[02:03:27.449 --> 02:03:29.330]  I mean, that is illogical.
[02:03:29.330 --> 02:03:31.832]  That is an oxymoron.
[02:03:31.832 --> 02:03:41.319]  But to a public that doesn't know what an oxymoron is, they just go, oh, my God, our freedom, we better... It's like the woman says in Terror Storm, she goes, I want to give up my liberty for freedom.
[02:03:41.319 --> 02:03:43.080]  I want to give up my liberty for freedom.
[02:03:43.080 --> 02:03:45.662]  John, will you YouTube that and find it?
[02:03:45.662 --> 02:03:48.724]  I want to play P-Brain when we get back.
[02:03:48.724 --> 02:03:52.707]  In Bobbitt's view, the current wars against terror provide a shrill wake-up call
[02:03:53.391 --> 02:03:56.013]  By the way, they think you're pea brains too, the globalists.
[02:03:56.013 --> 02:04:00.616]  They just pat you on the head and con you and tell you how smart you are.
[02:04:00.616 --> 02:04:02.398]  I'm not talking to our listeners.
[02:04:02.398 --> 02:04:03.498]  A lot of times they're smarter than I am.
[02:04:03.498 --> 02:04:04.980]  Everybody knows it.
[02:04:04.980 --> 02:04:07.001]  I'm talking about the general public tuning in for the first time.
[02:04:07.001 --> 02:04:10.784]  We're on so many stations that we have tens of thousands of new listeners every day.
[02:04:10.784 --> 02:04:14.767]  And they're thinking, this is some arrogant, you know, guy shooting his mouth off, calling me dumb.
[02:04:14.767 --> 02:04:17.409]  Well, I mean, yeah, these are dangerous people.
[02:04:17.409 --> 02:04:19.530]  I don't see you fighting them.
[02:04:19.530 --> 02:04:20.571]  And so you are dumb.
[02:04:21.989 --> 02:04:24.231]  I mean, look, it's like your house is on fire.
[02:04:24.231 --> 02:04:26.773]  I'm the fire department, and I come in, your house is on fire.
[02:04:26.773 --> 02:04:29.015]  The roof's caving in, and I say, get up out of your bed.
[02:04:29.015 --> 02:04:31.337]  You weigh 400 pounds.
[02:04:31.337 --> 02:04:33.438]  I can't get you up to get you out of the door.
[02:04:33.438 --> 02:04:34.239]  You're not helping me.
[02:04:34.239 --> 02:04:36.701]  I'm probably going to start slapping you.
[02:04:36.701 --> 02:04:37.722]  I mean, this is serious.
[02:04:37.722 --> 02:04:39.203]  These people are eating your lunch.
[02:04:39.203 --> 02:04:41.224]  They're eating my lunch, and I need you to beat them.
[02:04:41.224 --> 02:04:41.825]  So wake up.
[02:04:47.250 --> 02:04:49.211]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[02:04:49.211 --> 02:04:52.813]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:04:52.813 --> 02:04:55.275]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:04:55.275 --> 02:04:58.317]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:04:58.317 --> 02:05:04.060]  It is essential that Patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[02:05:04.060 --> 02:05:07.963]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[02:05:08.303 --> 02:05:13.486]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[02:05:13.486 --> 02:05:16.547]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.
[02:05:16.547 --> 02:05:23.751]  All 18 of my documentary films can be downloaded or streamed in super high quality directly to your computer or iPhone and shared with others.

[02:05:29.734 --> 02:05:34.257]  My weekly news television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews, and so much more.
[02:05:34.557 --> 02:05:37.418]  The Info War is waiting for you to set it free.
[02:05:37.418 --> 02:05:39.479]  Join PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:05:39.479 --> 02:05:41.460]  Burn the info bombs to disk.
[02:05:41.460 --> 02:05:43.601]  Put them on the file-sharing networks.
[02:05:43.601 --> 02:05:45.361]  Bring down the New World Order.
[02:05:45.361 --> 02:05:47.182]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:05:47.182 --> 02:05:50.543]  Someday, cancer, diabetes, and poor health may disrupt your life.
[02:05:50.543 --> 02:05:53.484]  Are you going to be the one in four who gets cancer in their lifetime?
[02:05:53.484 --> 02:05:57.226]  Well, now you can set aside your worries and offset that chance with Al-Qabita.
[02:05:57.446 --> 02:06:04.308]  Alkavita is a pure elemental liquid silicon that is high in oxygen and highly alkaline to help balance our acidic lifestyles.
[02:06:04.308 --> 02:06:10.870]  Fast food and unhealthy habits contribute to excess acid and undesirable effects that lay foundations of disease and poor health.
[02:06:10.870 --> 02:06:13.931]  Do you remember the old saying, an apple a day keeps the doctor away?
[02:06:13.931 --> 02:06:15.532]  Those words of wisdom are true.
[02:06:15.532 --> 02:06:23.054]  Your body heals itself when eating well, rather than fighting the effects of chemicals like corn syrup, sugar, preservatives, and other unpronounceable ingredients.
[02:06:23.254 --> 02:06:32.784]  Your body is the best pharmacy in the world and with AlkaVita, it can help your body naturally neutralize excess body acid and help hydrate your body, promoting the energized, healthier you.

[02:07:48.137 --> 02:07:56.524]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:07:56.524 --> 02:08:15.800]  All right, continuing with one of the arts
[02:08:16.989 --> 02:08:20.510]  Traitors, a little treacherous creature.
[02:08:20.510 --> 02:08:24.751]  Philip Bobbitt.
[02:08:24.751 --> 02:08:41.916]  Bobbitt's previous book, The Shield of Achilles, explored the grand themes of warfare and state development, marking his penchant for the Magnus Opus, a nearly 700 page, including more than 100 pages of notes.
[02:08:41.916 --> 02:08:43.036]  And I did read it.
[02:08:43.036 --> 02:08:44.757]  It was just mindless drivel.
[02:08:45.655 --> 02:08:53.067]  Uh, mix, like, they think mixing history in without even making the point and then a bunch of lies, uh, is intellectual.
[02:08:53.067 --> 02:09:00.079]  Because these guys, their great-great-grandpas may have been smart, but they're all inbred and basically about one IQ point above room temperature.
[02:09:01.570 --> 02:09:07.214]  Terror and Consent, that's the new book, follows suit, taking on a similarly big picture.
[02:09:07.214 --> 02:09:20.184]  If we want to defeat state-shattering terror, state-shattering terror in the 21st century, Bobbitt writes, we will have to transform the emerging constitutional order of the 21st century state.
[02:09:20.184 --> 02:09:24.368]  Yes, we've got to get rid of that, transform it.
[02:09:24.368 --> 02:09:29.752]  Specifically, we must stop thinking like a nation state and start thinking like the market state.
[02:09:30.549 --> 02:09:34.110]  While they fund nationalists of the South to overtake our country.
[02:09:34.110 --> 02:09:37.352]  That's like lowering our immune system and then infecting us.
[02:09:37.352 --> 02:09:46.796]  The nation-state, a constitutional order dedicated to protecting and improving the material welfare of its citizens, served the United States well.
[02:09:46.796 --> 02:09:49.477]  Of the United States was served, not the people.
[02:09:49.477 --> 02:09:52.318]  From the mid-19th century to the end of the Cold War.
[02:09:52.318 --> 02:09:53.918]  See how it's all the needs of the state.
[02:09:53.918 --> 02:09:55.159]  The state protecting the state.
[02:09:55.768 --> 02:09:57.229]  To the end of the Cold War.
[02:09:57.229 --> 02:10:01.392]  But Bobbitt contends it's vulnerable to a new battery of threats.
[02:10:01.392 --> 02:10:15.924]  I remember a few weeks ago in England, they had an article about Basra saying that the Shiite Basran Iraqi military, trained by the British, wouldn't show allegiance to the state and put down their arms against the fellow Shiites.
[02:10:15.924 --> 02:10:17.025]  And it was terrible.
[02:10:17.025 --> 02:10:21.108]  You couldn't indoctrinate them to serve and have allegiance to the state.
[02:10:22.176 --> 02:10:22.976]  Of course not.
[02:10:22.976 --> 02:10:26.858]  Of course it was to their countrymen and fellow people of the same religion.
[02:10:26.858 --> 02:10:30.400]  Not to you, some outlander, coming in there.
[02:10:30.400 --> 02:10:35.102]  And then they were attacking the Shiites to begin with, so they couldn't be part of the election.
[02:10:35.102 --> 02:10:37.584]  Breaking a truce!
[02:10:37.584 --> 02:10:42.886]  You have a dishonest, treacherous... But these people, they turn treachery into brotherhood.
[02:10:42.886 --> 02:10:45.087]  They turn brotherhood into treason.
[02:10:45.087 --> 02:10:45.688]  They turn, uh...
[02:10:47.151 --> 02:10:49.474]  Freedom into evil?
[02:10:49.474 --> 02:10:50.535]  War is slavery?
[02:10:50.535 --> 02:10:51.256]  It's just all of it.
[02:10:51.256 --> 02:10:52.357]  I've just had it with these people.
[02:10:52.357 --> 02:10:56.001]  War is peace?
[02:10:56.001 --> 02:11:02.788]  Specifically, we must stop thinking of the nation-state and start thinking like a market-state that we are inevitably becoming.
[02:11:02.788 --> 02:11:05.250]  You mean owned by a bunch of bankers who've sold us out.
[02:11:05.250 --> 02:11:09.535]  The nation-state, a constitutional order dedicated to protecting and empowering material welfare,
[02:11:10.982 --> 02:11:15.765]  of its citizens serve the United States well from the mid-19th century to the end of the Cold War.
[02:11:15.765 --> 02:11:19.988]  But Bobbitt contends it's vulnerable to a new battery of threats.
[02:11:19.988 --> 02:11:23.070]  The accessibility of weapons of mass destruction, which the U.S.
[02:11:23.070 --> 02:11:32.836]  government and British gave to Pakistan and India, and the missile systems of the Chinese and the reactors to the Russians, and all the technologies are handed out like hotcakes.
[02:11:32.836 --> 02:11:37.499]  Like in a Western, when the bad guy throws a gun down at the feet of the 12-year-old, then he goes for it and they shoot him.
[02:11:39.068 --> 02:11:47.672]  The globalization of international capital and the universalization of culture have eroded the conventional borders that once legitimated national security.
[02:11:47.672 --> 02:11:53.135]  So, they say globalism's done this, so we need more globalism now.
[02:11:53.135 --> 02:12:02.040]  What's needed is a constitutional order that takes its structural cues from multinational corporations and non-governmental organizations.
[02:12:02.040 --> 02:12:03.921]  Now, that's a key.
[02:12:03.921 --> 02:12:08.243]  We need a new international order that takes its cues
[02:12:09.167 --> 02:12:13.909]  From the corporations and the non-governmental organizations.
[02:12:13.909 --> 02:12:27.336]  So, the corporations that already use the governments like a meat puppet, a sock puppet, that they articulate, that they manipulate and control, they steer.
[02:12:27.336 --> 02:12:30.558]  Now, don't worry, the NGOs will speak for the people.
[02:12:30.558 --> 02:12:32.559]  The NGOs, the UN, let's come speak.
[02:12:32.559 --> 02:12:34.220]  The NGOs funded by the corporations.
[02:12:36.718 --> 02:12:41.481]  See, regional boards that are unelected now have more power in Texas than in the city, than the state.
[02:12:41.481 --> 02:12:43.802]  It's just, they do whatever they want.
[02:12:43.802 --> 02:12:48.384]  They have their own private SWAT teams, and if you don't like it, die!
[02:12:48.384 --> 02:13:02.672]  What's needed is a constitutional order that takes its structural cues from multinational corporations and non-governmental organizations, relying less on law, this is a quote, less on law and regulation, and more on market incentives.
[02:13:02.672 --> 02:13:04.553]  Yes, let's not have law
[02:13:06.121 --> 02:13:11.729]  And regulation, let's just do whatever we want to expand people's options.
[02:13:11.729 --> 02:13:14.253]  Oh yes, it will expand people's options on having law.
[02:13:14.253 --> 02:13:20.062]  Such as market states keeps its finger on the pulse of consumer demand, advocates
[02:13:21.226 --> 02:13:42.763]  He says, such a market state keeps its finger on the pulse of consumer demand, advocates trade liberalization, is prone to the privatization of public works, oh yes, the people pay for it, and then you hand it over to your buddies for nothing, and then they triple the price, but then they have a regional monopoly and cheat you, so it's not free market, it's corporations becoming tyrannical government.
[02:13:42.763 --> 02:13:45.765]  But you know the public gets that confused and doesn't know what you are, Bobbitt.
[02:13:47.759 --> 02:13:56.446]  Such a market state keeps its finger on the pulse of consumer demand, advocates trade liberalization, is prone to privatization of public works, and will outsource many functions.
[02:13:56.446 --> 02:13:57.507]  Those are quotes.
[02:13:57.507 --> 02:14:05.393]  In the seminar rooms of political science departments, the change is referred to as neoliberalism.
[02:14:05.393 --> 02:14:08.475]  On the streets, it is known as globalization.
[02:14:08.475 --> 02:14:13.159]  And Bobbitt, who is a geopolitical realist, so see, he's a realist, you're not.
[02:14:14.504 --> 02:14:16.446]  He knows what's realistic.
[02:14:16.446 --> 02:14:18.149]  The truth is, what they're doing isn't realistic.
[02:14:18.149 --> 02:14:20.031]  It's very hard to push through.
[02:14:20.031 --> 02:14:28.201]  It's a lot of resistance, but they're able to do it because they control the issuance of currency and credit, and this is a generational thing.
[02:14:28.201 --> 02:14:28.962]  So let's get real.
[02:14:28.962 --> 02:14:31.225]  It's very hard what you're doing, and it's in a lot of trouble, Bobbitt.
[02:14:32.759 --> 02:14:36.662]  And Bobbitt, who is a geopolitical realist, believes we have no choice but to embrace it.
[02:14:36.662 --> 02:14:46.008]  See, the neocons are discredited, so now the liberal Bobbitt comes in with the exact same paradigm, but with just neolib instead of neocon.
[02:14:46.008 --> 02:14:52.232]  The market state, Bobbitt contends, has great potential for the cause of individual freedom, but it also has a dark side.
[02:14:52.232 --> 02:14:53.853]  Oh, he's not going to be reasonable.
[02:14:53.853 --> 02:14:59.257]  Global terrorism has already taken advantage of its ethos of openness in order to undermine it.
[02:15:00.447 --> 02:15:03.569]  Oh yes, the terrorists want our freedom so we must take it.
[02:15:03.569 --> 02:15:14.195]  For example, wide open arms market that neoliberalism endorses has allowed terrorists to gain access to weapons of destruction they then use to destabilize legitimate market states.
[02:15:14.195 --> 02:15:14.836]  What do you mean?
[02:15:14.836 --> 02:15:18.458]  The criminals that run our government install nothing but dictatorships in the Middle East.
[02:15:18.458 --> 02:15:20.019]  They don't want democracy over there.
[02:15:20.019 --> 02:15:24.781]  In fact, they put religious sects in control.
[02:15:24.781 --> 02:15:28.984]  Back when they were mainline and you go anywhere in the Middle East and nobody attacked you and it was
[02:15:30.140 --> 02:15:35.723]  First World and the major cities and people weren't walking around in burkas.
[02:15:35.723 --> 02:15:40.125]  The globalists went in and funded radical Muslim groups, it's a fact, and then turned them loose.
[02:15:40.125 --> 02:15:41.666]  And now they quote, deal with them.
[02:15:41.666 --> 02:15:46.748]  And then when they take over Iraq, they put them in power.
[02:15:46.748 --> 02:15:47.468]  So sick.
[02:15:47.468 --> 02:15:48.909]  And then they'll remove them in power later.
[02:15:48.909 --> 02:15:51.210]  It's just a business.
[02:15:51.210 --> 02:15:56.993]  For example, the wide open arms market that neoliberalism endorses has allowed terrorists to gain access to weapons of destruction
[02:15:58.539 --> 02:16:01.640]  They then use it to stabilize legitimate market states.
[02:16:01.640 --> 02:16:15.486]  Market state terrorism, Bobbitt explains, thus feeds onto the ardently sought innovations of the 20th century to export the increasing vulnerability of market states to catastrophic events.
[02:16:15.486 --> 02:16:18.267]  You mean the bankers have got control of our financial system so they can
[02:16:19.105 --> 02:16:30.531]  Torture the daylights out of us and then every time they do it, they stage some little terror attack and claim it did it and claim the terrorists had the power to bring down the market when it was really you just shearing your sheep.
[02:16:30.531 --> 02:16:31.931]  What is to be done?
[02:16:31.931 --> 02:16:38.655]  Remember, they always create the crisis and then already are promoting the solution before their crisis is even created.
[02:16:38.655 --> 02:16:41.416]  Then they always stand around going, we're geniuses!
[02:16:41.416 --> 02:16:43.677]  We predicted the exact attack that happened.
[02:16:45.879 --> 02:16:46.800]  What is to be done?
[02:16:46.800 --> 02:16:48.160]  This is not fear-mongering.
[02:16:48.160 --> 02:16:49.901]  Oh, this is not fear-mongering.
[02:16:49.901 --> 02:16:52.923]  But rather a sophisticated... He's sophisticated.
[02:16:52.923 --> 02:16:54.784]  Geopolitical assessment.
[02:16:54.784 --> 02:16:58.606]  Oh, when you read these words like sophistication.
[02:16:58.606 --> 02:17:02.908]  Oh, you're so sophisticated reading this in the newspaper.
[02:17:02.908 --> 02:17:07.791]  Therefore, a great deal rests on the solutions Bobbitt offers.
[02:17:10.214 --> 02:17:18.961]  But never fear, it says, fortunately, his suggestions are, if not entirely novel, largely sensible.
[02:17:18.961 --> 02:17:25.326]  Oh, like getting rid of the Bill of Rights, sneak-attacking countries, having no more, uh, representative government.
[02:17:25.326 --> 02:17:29.229]  Oh, very sensible!
[02:17:29.229 --> 02:17:30.450]  Sophisticated!
[02:17:30.450 --> 02:17:31.171]  Assessment!
[02:17:31.171 --> 02:17:33.333]  You know, these are the words.
[02:17:33.333 --> 02:17:36.155]  This is just outrageous!
[02:17:36.155 --> 02:17:39.518]  Just total tyranny on its face!
[02:17:43.021 --> 02:17:44.282]  Hitler wasn't this bold.
[02:17:44.282 --> 02:17:48.026]  Stalin, Mao.
[02:17:48.026 --> 02:17:49.728]  Julius Caesar.
[02:17:49.728 --> 02:17:51.630]  They just did it, but they lied and said they were.
[02:17:51.630 --> 02:17:53.972]  Not these guys, they just say, torture children with pliers.
[02:17:57.833 --> 02:18:01.896]  Fortunately, oh fortunately, he's gonna save us.
[02:18:01.896 --> 02:18:07.840]  His suggestions are, if not entirely novel, which they're not, largely sensible.
[02:18:07.840 --> 02:18:09.741]  Oh, I'm glad somebody is.
[02:18:09.741 --> 02:18:20.768]  But they are ambitious to the point of being unachievable without extraordinary political leadership and unprecedented corporate discipline.
[02:18:20.768 --> 02:18:26.052]  And they have all these big corporate retreats, and if you tow this line, they give you bigger jobs and more power, and you move up.
[02:18:26.949 --> 02:18:27.990]  They have unlimited money.
[02:18:27.990 --> 02:18:39.901]  They have whole corporate structures with guys making 500 grand, a million, 5 million, 20 million, 200 million a year, doing almost nothing, but just doing evil, going along with it.
[02:18:39.901 --> 02:18:50.510]  They are ambitions to the point of being unachievable without extraordinary political leadership and unprecedented corporate discipline.
[02:18:50.510 --> 02:18:54.974]  Aren't we lucky we have... See, this is why I don't read a lot of articles in whole, because if I do, I just analyze them to death.
[02:18:55.825 --> 02:19:09.469]  First, Bobbitt argues that the market state must allow the time-worn strategies of deterrence and containment to yield to the more aggressive tactics of preclusionary warfare.
[02:19:09.469 --> 02:19:11.529]  That's a way to say preemptive.
[02:19:11.529 --> 02:19:20.412]  But that word's now been discredited, so now it's preclusionary warfare, and they'll change it again.
[02:19:20.412 --> 02:19:23.733]  We're gonna come back and finish up with this, and I'll get into the economy, ha ha ha.
[02:19:24.548 --> 02:19:25.769]  I've got this story here.
[02:19:25.769 --> 02:19:27.629]  The government is trying to wrap its mind around yours.
[02:19:27.629 --> 02:19:29.070]  I've been trying to cover it for three days.
[02:19:29.070 --> 02:19:30.411]  I will cover it!
[02:19:30.411 --> 02:19:31.911]  And then we'll go to your calls later.
[02:19:31.911 --> 02:19:33.512]  The phones aren't open yet.
[02:19:33.512 --> 02:19:35.113]  They will be.
[02:19:35.113 --> 02:19:38.254]  But if I gotta talk for ten hours to cover all this, I am.
[02:19:38.254 --> 02:19:39.975]  We just might go for five hours today.
[02:19:39.975 --> 02:19:40.875]  I don't know.
[02:19:40.875 --> 02:19:41.736]  We'll be right back.
[02:19:41.736 --> 02:19:43.336]  PrisonPlanet.TV.

[02:19:50.211 --> 02:19:51.972]  A New World Order!
[02:19:51.972 --> 02:19:56.853]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:19:56.853 --> 02:19:59.694]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:19:59.694 --> 02:20:02.475]  Put their objective being world domination.
[02:20:02.475 --> 02:20:05.656]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:20:05.656 --> 02:20:12.979]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:20:16.024 --> 02:20:21.470]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[02:20:25.334 --> 02:20:27.896]  Bill Burr is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:20:27.896 --> 02:20:29.058]  Most people have no idea.
[02:20:29.058 --> 02:20:29.859]  They're not after money.
[02:20:29.859 --> 02:20:31.140]  They have all the money they need.
[02:20:31.140 --> 02:20:32.121]  They're after power.
[02:20:32.121 --> 02:20:33.262]  That's what they're after these years.

[02:20:42.710 --> 02:20:44.751]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:20:44.751 --> 02:20:46.652]  You have been warned.
[02:20:46.652 --> 02:20:47.132]  Fact.
[02:20:47.132 --> 02:20:52.995]  Rapid industrialization has resulted in environmental pollution and its curse on world health is staggering.
[02:20:53.135 --> 02:20:57.459]  We live in a toxic world that is bombarded by seven new chemicals each day.
[02:20:57.459 --> 02:21:05.146]  The human body is amazing and efficient in design, but because of the polluted world in which we live, is unable to remove all toxins.
[02:21:05.146 --> 02:21:05.887]  The solution?
[02:21:05.887 --> 02:21:10.111]  Detoxification integrated with Electro-Chi Premier Energy Foot Spa.
[02:21:10.111 --> 02:21:12.093]  The Electro-Chi Premier Energy Foot Spa.
[02:21:12.193 --> 02:21:12.553]  I think so.
[02:21:32.062 --> 02:21:32.302]  I think so.
[02:21:46.829 --> 02:21:49.690]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.

[02:21:56.794 --> 02:21:58.555]  America, freedom to fascism.
[02:21:58.555 --> 02:22:05.578]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available at truthnews.us and prisonplanet.com.

[02:22:47.856 --> 02:22:49.237]  I'm Harold Williams.
[02:22:49.237 --> 02:22:51.318]  I know about martial law.
[02:22:51.318 --> 02:22:53.199]  I want to teach you how to survive it.
[02:22:53.199 --> 02:23:02.144]  America has 10 telling signs of martial law, so use the short time left to learn to protect your family with the vital information in this book.
[02:23:02.144 --> 02:23:04.926]  Find the book at survivemartiallaw.com.
[02:23:04.926 --> 02:23:08.368]  I will tell you what you need to know to prepare for martial law.
[02:23:08.368 --> 02:23:09.669]  Things are changing fast.
[02:23:09.949 --> 02:23:12.752]  We even email you a free weekly update.
[02:23:12.752 --> 02:23:20.161]  I teach you how to act around troops, where to put supplies, how to be safe during the worst part of martial law, which is in the beginning.
[02:23:20.161 --> 02:23:24.206]  Surviving this major life transition can be difficult, but possible.
[02:23:24.206 --> 02:23:29.172]  Arm yourself with the knowledge, as this is the only weapon you will have to protect your family.
[02:23:29.292 --> 02:23:31.454]  I want to be clear about something.
[02:23:57.370 --> 02:24:03.277]  We are probably not going to go into martial law overnight.
[02:24:03.277 --> 02:24:08.523]  It's a martial law system.
[02:24:08.523 --> 02:24:17.273]  You know, first it's in the airports, then it's on the trains, then the streets being randomly searched, then it's the highways, then it's schools.
[02:24:17.273 --> 02:24:17.974]  Now happening.
[02:24:19.955 --> 02:24:24.036]  Curfews after 10, 10.30 in major cities for adults.
[02:24:24.036 --> 02:24:28.277]  Main question, more and more police not having due process.
[02:24:28.277 --> 02:24:46.241]  What Philip Bobbitt at the University of Texas, one of the top globalists writing up policy at the LBJ School of Law and Public Affairs and also Columbia.
[02:24:46.241 --> 02:24:48.162]  They're talking about a martial law system.
[02:24:50.143 --> 02:24:55.044]  Martial law doesn't have to be the hot martial law, lockdown cities, and door-to-door gun confiscations.
[02:24:55.044 --> 02:24:59.485]  They just do it slowly, door-to-door, sector-by-sector confiscating the guns, as they're now getting ready for.
[02:24:59.485 --> 02:25:00.325]  And that's coming up later.
[02:25:00.325 --> 02:25:05.186]  I got a bunch of gun confiscation news coming up.
[02:25:05.186 --> 02:25:11.407]  But, uh, finishing up with this, it just goes on and on.
[02:25:11.407 --> 02:25:19.589]  Bobbitt argues that the market state must allow the time-worn strategies of deterrence and containment to yield to a more aggressive tactics of
[02:25:20.578 --> 02:25:29.263]  Preclusionary warfare, which is preemptive, in a war which we're in.
[02:25:29.263 --> 02:25:43.170]  Market states share the burden of employing power, preclusionary, rather than waiting for an acute crisis to set in that irrevocably puts us at a disadvantage.
[02:25:43.170 --> 02:25:44.851]  So, just attacking people all the time.
[02:25:44.851 --> 02:25:45.992]  And who is us?
[02:25:45.992 --> 02:25:47.453]  Not the people, the elite.
[02:25:47.453 --> 02:25:48.233]  It's their interest.
[02:25:48.939 --> 02:25:51.880]  Remember, it's their interest, not your interest.
[02:25:51.880 --> 02:25:59.964]  Venturing educated guesses about the behavior of future threats is no one's idea of an ideal tactical strategy.
[02:25:59.964 --> 02:26:08.068]  But Bobbitt argues that if we strengthened our alliances with other states, networks of shared intelligence could do an impressive job of it.
[02:26:08.068 --> 02:26:08.508]  What do you mean?
[02:26:08.508 --> 02:26:10.709]  We're already merged with Europe.
[02:26:10.709 --> 02:26:15.011]  Of course, that just means that as an American, you can't run over there or they're after you, or vice versa.
[02:26:15.560 --> 02:26:16.600]  It's all about the individual.
[02:26:16.600 --> 02:26:19.382]  This is all about war on individuals, not even rogue states.
[02:26:19.382 --> 02:26:26.144]  Of course, this would require a more invasive process of information gathering within and across national borders.
[02:26:26.144 --> 02:26:35.048]  In order to reduce the threat of civil liberties, this would entail, Bobbitt highlights, our commitment to globalize the systems of human rights and government by consent.
[02:26:36.175 --> 02:26:40.937]  But that's just where they claim the NGOs say they don't want a Fourth Amendment.
[02:26:40.937 --> 02:26:42.598]  That's what Mayor Koch said.
[02:26:42.598 --> 02:26:44.939]  He said, Europe doesn't want a First Amendment.
[02:26:44.939 --> 02:26:46.420]  They want to not have any rights.
[02:26:46.420 --> 02:26:47.580]  They like it.
[02:26:47.580 --> 02:26:49.881]  They like not being able to vote on the EU.
[02:26:49.881 --> 02:26:50.982]  They like it.
[02:26:50.982 --> 02:26:52.602]  No, they don't.
[02:26:52.602 --> 02:27:00.906]  He insists that emerging market states must collectively, out of self-respect, define and protect our inalienable rights.
[02:27:03.669 --> 02:27:10.435]  What this means is concrete terms and that governments must rethink ideas like Homeland Security.
[02:27:10.435 --> 02:27:11.816]  See, again, sounds reasonable.
[02:27:11.816 --> 02:27:12.357]  None of it is.
[02:27:12.357 --> 02:27:17.562]  It's just like Gary Hart playing the liberal saying, I never said New World Order.
[02:27:17.562 --> 02:27:18.382]  That's a lie.
[02:27:18.382 --> 02:27:20.144]  And we have video of him saying it.
[02:27:20.144 --> 02:27:22.786]  I mean, this is how they operate.
[02:27:22.786 --> 02:27:28.051]  He even gave a speech a few months ago where he said, just like I said years ago, we need a New World Order.
[02:27:28.051 --> 02:27:30.013]  And then later to a crowd, I never said that.
[02:27:31.354 --> 02:27:36.899]  He's still in the paradigm of there not being YouTube and Google.
[02:27:36.899 --> 02:27:40.382]  And thousands of other places to see video.
[02:27:40.382 --> 02:27:41.924]  Ten years ago, he could get away with that.
[02:27:41.924 --> 02:27:43.005]  Twenty years ago.
[02:27:43.005 --> 02:27:50.171]  I never said that people would look at the young man saying, you know, that young communist liar, he doesn't like Gary Hart.
[02:27:50.171 --> 02:27:55.036]  But you can't do it now, can you, punk?
[02:27:55.036 --> 02:27:57.078]  When the threats to security cannot be neatly
[02:28:00.620 --> 02:28:10.148]  Combined, as in or out of the homeland, or neatly cabined, that an alliance of democracies must form to discourage isolationism.
[02:28:10.148 --> 02:28:12.210]  Oh, that means global government.
[02:28:12.210 --> 02:28:20.758]  And that the United States must change its role as hegemon in NATO, so give up any supremacy we have, which was always the plan.
[02:28:20.758 --> 02:28:25.682]  We do the dirty work for the next step of the New World Order, then we take the blame for it, and then they expand the next wave.
[02:28:27.185 --> 02:28:39.130]  Only then can a consortium of neoliberal democracies draw a bright line rule against the international inflection of pain on any person detained by government.
[02:28:39.130 --> 02:28:43.152]  One of the many human rights threats that Bobbitt believes we must address.
[02:28:43.152 --> 02:28:43.932]  These developments
[02:28:44.591 --> 02:28:47.413]  He's saying we've got to fight tyranny, we've got to have tyranny.
[02:28:47.413 --> 02:28:49.935]  We've got to have rights, but not have any.
[02:29:08.470 --> 02:29:09.691]  It just goes on and on.
[02:29:09.691 --> 02:29:10.751]  The messy reality.
[02:29:10.751 --> 02:29:12.352]  He gets into global government.
[02:29:12.352 --> 02:29:21.878]  Under the picture of him on this story, it says, University of Texas Senior Fellow Philip Bobbitt makes a new case for a new kind of world order.
[02:29:21.878 --> 02:29:23.119]  And I've got to stop there.
[02:29:23.119 --> 02:29:24.160]  There's even more to the article.
[02:29:24.160 --> 02:29:26.441]  It's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:29:26.441 --> 02:29:36.368]  I'm going to come back, get into the government is trying to wrap its mind around yours, talk about the economy, get into gun control, gun confiscation going on, and take your phone call.
[02:29:36.368 --> 02:29:36.768]  Stay with us.
[02:29:38.001 --> 02:29:41.931]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:29:41.931 --> 02:29:44.618]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:50.986 --> 02:29:54.729]  Have you noticed how every type of gadget these days requires some specific type of battery?
[02:29:54.729 --> 02:29:56.731]  It doesn't matter what kind of gadget you're using.

[02:30:48.023 --> 02:30:50.004]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:30:50.004 --> 02:30:56.967]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[02:30:56.967 --> 02:31:05.351]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[02:31:11.394 --> 02:31:11.795]  I don't know.

[02:31:48.939 --> 02:31:55.025]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of disease such as cancer or diabetes?
[02:31:55.025 --> 02:32:00.970]  Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat, what we drink, the environment, and our high-stress lifestyles.
[02:32:00.970 --> 02:32:05.114]  It's these choices that cause decreased energy, weight gain, and eventually disease.
[02:32:05.114 --> 02:32:10.019]  The easiest way to reduce disease-causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[02:32:10.279 --> 02:32:18.761]  At SnyderHealth.com we offer a full line of alkaline water ionizers from Jupiter Science, the leader in water ionization technology for over 25 years.

[02:33:06.962 --> 02:33:10.583]  Okay, we're back live.
[02:33:10.583 --> 02:33:15.705]  I want to get into the economy, and then I'm going to briefly get into the government that's trying to wrap its mind around yours.
[02:33:15.705 --> 02:33:19.826]  I'm meant to spend hours on this story, and I haven't done it in three days.
[02:33:19.826 --> 02:33:20.406]  Four days!
[02:33:20.406 --> 02:33:24.327]  I mentioned it Sunday.
[02:33:24.327 --> 02:33:27.428]  On the economic front, the bankers, by design,
[02:33:28.777 --> 02:33:38.382]  And again, I made a film with footage shot two and three years ago where we said they would implode the subprime mortgage market, and then even the Financial Times of London has admitted that that's the case.
[02:33:38.382 --> 02:33:39.523]  It's all being done by design.
[02:33:39.523 --> 02:33:44.205]  We've had Ron Paul on, another economist on, to tell you that it's being done by design.
[02:33:46.433 --> 02:33:49.514]  And they are trying to suppress the price of gold, but it's just not working.
[02:33:49.514 --> 02:33:58.136]  They've been trying to suppress it down below 400 for years, and it has really rallied today, going up to 950 and back and forth.
[02:33:58.136 --> 02:34:02.477]  $950 an ounce silver going way up.
[02:34:02.477 --> 02:34:07.038]  Dollar falls for record against Euro as EU inflation quickens.
[02:34:07.038 --> 02:34:10.139]  Now, I got up this morning, and I saw that headline, and I said, well, let me look at gold.
[02:34:10.139 --> 02:34:11.720]  It'll be way up.
[02:34:11.720 --> 02:34:12.240]  And it was up $20.
[02:34:15.393 --> 02:34:26.419]  Yeah, and that's with the IMF this week and last week dumping tens of billions of dollars of gold in the market at below spot, trying to drive the market down, and it isn't working.
[02:34:26.419 --> 02:34:32.843]  You need to use this as an incentive now to get into precious metals, ladies and gentlemen, before it blasts right past a thousand.
[02:34:32.843 --> 02:34:37.325]  It should be over $2,300 an ounce now for how far the dollars drop.
[02:34:37.325 --> 02:34:43.028]  The dollar is at an all-time low, and it'll go down a little bit more, and then it'll gain a few cents back.
[02:34:43.028 --> 02:34:44.209]  But if you look at the graph,
[02:34:44.858 --> 02:34:47.979]  On a yearly graph, it's going straight down.
[02:34:47.979 --> 02:34:50.941]  But the media makes you focus on the day-to-day, week-to-week.
[02:34:50.941 --> 02:34:53.102]  It's the graph.
[02:34:53.102 --> 02:34:56.603]  It's the graph.
[02:34:56.603 --> 02:35:00.725]  Gold boost by fresh dollar losses.
[02:35:00.725 --> 02:35:01.786]  Oil gains.
[02:35:01.786 --> 02:35:06.348]  Oil at all-time record high.
[02:35:06.348 --> 02:35:08.609]  Unbelievable.
[02:35:08.609 --> 02:35:10.710]  Spot gold hit a record high of 1,030.80 an ounce.
[02:35:13.667 --> 02:35:17.828]  On March 17th, it is now headed back that direction.
[02:35:17.828 --> 02:35:21.128]  And that's Reuters, we've got Bloomberg here.
[02:35:21.128 --> 02:35:31.790]  The dollar fell to a record low against the Euro after European inflation accelerated in March, reducing the chances that the region's central bank will follow the Federal Reserve in cutting interest rates.
[02:35:31.790 --> 02:35:32.630]  That's right.
[02:35:32.630 --> 02:35:41.632]  And when Europe doesn't cut interest rates, and our interest rates are at 2%, and their interest rates are at 5.5% on average in Europe, some places higher, some places lower, what are people going to buy?
[02:35:42.327 --> 02:35:45.228]  They're going to buy foreign currencies, not the dollar.
[02:35:45.228 --> 02:35:50.630]  It's worthless in interest and in its true value.
[02:35:50.630 --> 02:35:58.472]  So the dollar has dropped to an all-time high of 1.60 to the euro.
[02:35:58.472 --> 02:35:58.492]  1.60.
[02:35:58.492 --> 02:36:02.674]  A euro is worth 1.60 to the dollar.
[02:36:02.674 --> 02:36:06.455]  In 2000, when the euro opened, it was worth 82 cents to the dollar.
[02:36:06.455 --> 02:36:07.275]  So what's 60 and 18?
[02:36:07.275 --> 02:36:07.536]  60 and 18.
[02:36:13.004 --> 02:36:16.688]  A 78 point swing.
[02:36:16.688 --> 02:36:24.277]  60 cents on the face with another 18 points.
[02:36:24.277 --> 02:36:30.184]  The fundamentals are all there and the facts are there that the dollar is going to continue to slide.
[02:36:30.184 --> 02:36:31.606]  I pray it slides slowly.
[02:36:32.287 --> 02:36:35.829]  Because then it won't be too much of a complete panic war in the streets.
[02:36:35.829 --> 02:36:42.374]  But it could just, you know, two months from now, a year from now, tomorrow, you don't know, could just suddenly start plunging 20 cents a day.
[02:36:42.374 --> 02:36:45.376]  And then it's gonna be runs on banks, hysteria.
[02:36:45.376 --> 02:36:47.177]  I mean, we're sitting on top of powder keg.
[02:36:47.177 --> 02:36:49.379]  It's like climbing in a lion's den.
[02:36:49.379 --> 02:36:55.443]  People fall in lion's dens, you know, a couple times a year, and most of the times the lions just lay there and ignore you.
[02:36:55.443 --> 02:36:58.265]  But sometimes you fall in, they attack you and kill you.
[02:36:58.265 --> 02:36:59.806]  Well, we're sitting on top of a lion.
[02:37:01.178 --> 02:37:03.019]  That's hungry in a pit.
[02:37:03.019 --> 02:37:04.219]  And I don't know what it's going to do.
[02:37:04.219 --> 02:37:05.960]  I just know this.
[02:37:05.960 --> 02:37:08.881]  There's a rope out of the pit and it's called gold.
[02:37:08.881 --> 02:37:11.802]  Oil hits a new record as investors flee falling dollar.
[02:37:11.802 --> 02:37:16.504]  This is out of the Associated Press as well.
[02:37:16.504 --> 02:37:19.005]  Weakening dollar since oil prices are records high.
[02:37:19.005 --> 02:37:25.367]  Above $114 a barrel as dollar tumbles.
[02:37:25.367 --> 02:37:27.728]  And people are still having debates domestically.
[02:37:27.728 --> 02:37:30.369]  Everyone knows it in foreign countries because they're in reality.
[02:37:30.369 --> 02:37:30.889]  Here it's like
[02:37:32.202 --> 02:37:34.583]  I wonder if oil's up because the dollar's low.
[02:37:34.583 --> 02:37:36.803]  I wonder if gold's up.
[02:37:36.803 --> 02:37:40.825]  People say, well, the government says they want a strong dollar.
[02:37:40.825 --> 02:37:42.365]  That's why they're trying to dump gold.
[02:37:42.365 --> 02:37:43.025]  No.
[02:37:43.025 --> 02:37:47.987]  They want you to only know about the weak dollar so you don't have a place to escape to like gold.
[02:37:47.987 --> 02:37:49.147]  They're doing both.
[02:37:49.147 --> 02:37:53.288]  Whoever said economic reality played any part in this?
[02:37:53.288 --> 02:37:53.749]  I know this.
[02:37:53.749 --> 02:37:57.030]  They are devaluing your dollar by more than 70%.
[02:37:57.030 --> 02:37:59.830]  They've now done it by more than 70% from what it opened.
[02:37:59.830 --> 02:38:01.811]  60 plus percent from parity with the euro.
[02:38:03.366 --> 02:38:07.247]  And, uh, gold is going up.
[02:38:07.247 --> 02:38:09.588]  Gold futures rally is dollar fall sharply.
[02:38:09.588 --> 02:38:13.629]  Gold futures have gold even higher in the weeks to come.
[02:38:13.629 --> 02:38:15.450]  And the futures are almost always correct.
[02:38:15.450 --> 02:38:24.913]  So, uh, Ted Anderson did an offer here yesterday, and, uh, he has gold priced out at back when it was like 920.
[02:38:24.913 --> 02:38:27.494]  And, uh, so he has that gold in stock.
[02:38:28.217 --> 02:38:36.939]  And so, you can get gold at very, very affordable prices, because Ted has secured it before gold went up.
[02:38:36.939 --> 02:38:40.320]  But, in every case, we've told you that it's happened.
[02:38:40.320 --> 02:38:46.161]  As it continues to go up in a few days, a week, we're not sure he won't be able to offer this when it runs out.
[02:38:46.161 --> 02:38:48.181]  I didn't even ask Ted if he has any silver.
[02:38:48.181 --> 02:38:50.742]  Major suppliers sold out all over.
[02:38:50.742 --> 02:38:51.862]  Ted, what do you have to offer today?
[02:38:52.751 --> 02:38:58.854]  Well, like you said, Alex, I'm smart enough to know that I need to secure my positions on these dips.
[02:38:58.854 --> 02:39:03.376]  I mean, I wish people were on the dealer side of this market so they could see what's going on.
[02:39:03.376 --> 02:39:05.137]  Supplies are very tight.
[02:39:05.137 --> 02:39:14.322]  A lot of the dealers, especially silver, just like you said, we do have silver dollars right now, and I can carry over that special that we talked about yesterday for silver dollars at $5.78 per roll at $20.
[02:39:17.222 --> 02:39:19.746]  The gold market is also tight right now.
[02:39:19.746 --> 02:39:24.313]  I mean, obviously, with the dollar falling like it is, and you look at it today, what is it right now?
[02:39:24.313 --> 02:39:25.675]  I looked at it, what was it? 71.42.
[02:39:28.392 --> 02:39:41.838]  That's as low as I've seen yet, you know, and it's going to continue to drop because the United States is under this deficit spending binge, and every time that we have a problem here in the United States, something crops up.
[02:39:41.838 --> 02:39:48.221]  They always look to the Federal Reserve System to print more money and lower interest rates to stimulate the economy.
[02:39:48.221 --> 02:39:49.982]  The United States of America was a
[02:39:52.945 --> 02:39:55.510]  World-renowned currency.
[02:39:55.510 --> 02:40:00.460]  We were the arm of stability because of the fact that we were backed by gold through 1971.
[02:40:02.379 --> 02:40:16.044]  And since the war in Vietnam, Nixon took us off that gold standard, and we've just done nothing but to try to destroy the dollar, and now finally it's all showing up here, and that's why we're seeing the dollar fall.
[02:40:16.044 --> 02:40:19.026]  And it'll go on further, because you just watch what happens.
[02:40:19.026 --> 02:40:22.667]  Anytime we're going to have a problem here, they're going to go to printing money.
[02:40:23.308 --> 02:40:33.712]  And just like you said, like Ron Paul says, like Paul Craig Roberts is saying, like just about every economist out there is saying right now the dollar is doomed because of the fact that foreigners want to get away from the U.S.
[02:40:33.712 --> 02:40:34.512]  currency.
[02:40:34.512 --> 02:40:40.374]  I mean, 1.3 trillion dollars over in Japan, or I'm sorry, over in
[02:40:40.934 --> 02:40:42.595]  China, what do you think they want to do?
[02:40:42.595 --> 02:40:44.256]  They want to get away from the dollar right now.
[02:40:44.256 --> 02:40:47.277]  They're showing that with their feet.
[02:40:47.277 --> 02:40:48.918]  Oil prices going up is another thing.
[02:40:48.918 --> 02:40:49.678]  It's a commodity.
[02:40:49.678 --> 02:40:50.599]  Gold is going to go up.
[02:40:50.599 --> 02:40:52.880]  They are trying to suppress the price of gold.
[02:40:52.880 --> 02:40:58.162]  They're more successful with suppressing the price of gold right now than they are with oil, but it's like a rubber band.
[02:40:58.162 --> 02:41:02.124]  Anytime you try to hold something down, it springs up even further.
[02:41:02.124 --> 02:41:05.085]  And so, yeah, right now there's no question about it.
[02:41:05.085 --> 02:41:06.506]  Gold is at a good buying range.
[02:41:07.067 --> 02:41:10.793]  And currently what I have, what I locked in on, are these British sovereigns.
[02:41:10.793 --> 02:41:11.474]  They're at $257 per coin.
[02:41:11.474 --> 02:41:12.656]  And then I have the French franc at $205.
[02:41:17.430 --> 02:41:29.675]  Both of those coins are just, it's like getting involved with something that's small enough that you can trade if you have to buy food and pay your house payments, make a car payment, that kind of thing.
[02:41:29.675 --> 02:41:40.640]  If the dollar really falls here, I mean, there's no sense of having to lose your property and having to starve because we're going to a depression, which just about every economist is talking about.
[02:41:40.640 --> 02:41:42.521]  If you have the gold, you'll be buying food.
[02:41:43.181 --> 02:41:46.962]  And you'll be buying the things, the staples that you need, because gold is money.
[02:41:46.962 --> 02:41:48.283]  It has been for over 6,000 years.
[02:41:48.283 --> 02:41:59.126]  Well, just as an investment with the entire financial order teetering on the edge of a knife, it is completely mindless to not move heavily into commodities.
[02:41:59.126 --> 02:42:07.569]  And the most portable, and the traditionally safest place to be is precious metals and gold, is at the tip-top of that pyramid of investments.
[02:42:07.569 --> 02:42:09.110]  Give them the number, Ted.
[02:42:09.110 --> 02:42:10.250]  Yeah, they can catch us at 1-800-686.
[02:42:13.206 --> 02:42:14.327]  2-2-3-7.
[02:42:14.327 --> 02:42:18.091]  Again, it's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:42:18.091 --> 02:42:21.254]  I would be looking at your stock portfolio seriously.
[02:42:21.254 --> 02:42:22.656]  I'd be looking at your IRAs.
[02:42:22.656 --> 02:42:25.158]  Anything that you have that's denominated in U.S.
[02:42:25.158 --> 02:42:28.682]  dollar right now at this particular time, you should be moving because
[02:42:29.202 --> 02:42:34.504]  You know, right now you can take a look at what's going on in the world economy.
[02:42:34.504 --> 02:42:37.624]  It's getting more and more volatile every minute.
[02:42:37.624 --> 02:42:39.805]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:42:39.805 --> 02:42:44.026]  And Ted's got gold at the price it was last week.
[02:42:44.026 --> 02:42:45.647]  Gold is shooting up right now.
[02:42:45.647 --> 02:42:46.347]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:42:46.347 --> 02:42:51.328]  Real quick, Ted, because I know you're busy.
[02:42:51.328 --> 02:42:53.549]  Tell them again about the gold coins you've got on special.
[02:42:54.125 --> 02:42:54.646]  Yeah, sure.
[02:42:54.646 --> 02:42:58.729]  We've got the British Sovereign coin, which is a quarter of an ounce gold coin right now.
[02:42:58.729 --> 02:43:01.571]  They're at $257 per coin.
[02:43:01.571 --> 02:43:06.054]  We also have the French franc coin, which is one-fifth of an ounce.
[02:43:06.054 --> 02:43:07.155]  We have the silver dollars.
[02:43:07.155 --> 02:43:17.123]  Now, these are the silver dollars, Alex, that were manufactured by the United States government, meant to be used here as $1 in currency, all the way up through, what was it, 1934.
[02:43:19.134 --> 02:43:22.563]  And so they're available as well.
[02:43:22.563 --> 02:43:24.649]  That stuff is in real short supply.
[02:43:24.649 --> 02:43:26.614]  They quit making those back in the early 1900s.
[02:43:28.050 --> 02:43:31.651]  They melted a lot of them off in 1980 when silver went up to $50.
[02:43:31.651 --> 02:43:33.592]  Yeah, folks, I need to give you a call.
[02:43:33.592 --> 02:43:35.993]  For months, you haven't even had silver dollars in.
[02:43:35.993 --> 02:43:37.473]  You couldn't get them at a reasonable price.
[02:43:37.473 --> 02:43:38.094]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:43:38.094 --> 02:43:40.374]  Ted, thanks.
[02:43:40.374 --> 02:43:43.395]  Yeah, thanks a lot for having me up, Alex.
[02:43:43.395 --> 02:43:43.655]  You bet.
[02:43:43.655 --> 02:43:44.236]  Thank you, Ted.
[02:43:44.236 --> 02:43:47.677]  Yeah, we spent about 10 minutes on that because it is very important.
[02:43:47.677 --> 02:43:50.258]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:43:50.258 --> 02:43:53.859]  Look, I know we got a lot of phone lines and we got the fourth hour coming up.
[02:43:54.747 --> 02:44:06.753]  What I want to do, because I don't want to be unfair to all these callers, is John, give them my fourth hour call in line, and we'll put them all at the head of the line, because I want to talk to all these people that are patiently holding.
[02:44:06.753 --> 02:44:17.718]  And we'll go ahead and open the phone lines up, but... And John, you can give them that number.
[02:44:17.718 --> 02:44:17.898]  It's 512-646-5400.
[02:44:17.898 --> 02:44:17.938]  512-646-5400.
[02:44:24.804 --> 02:44:33.848]  And we'll put Vince and Joshua and Randy and Chris and John at the head of the line, and I'll take their calls immediately when we start the fourth hour into overdrive here.
[02:44:33.848 --> 02:44:42.332]  Uh, but, uh, and we're gonna open that phone up in just a few minutes, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:44:42.332 --> 02:44:54.437]  But before I do that, I wanted to go ahead and play this gun control piece, and the problem is there's so many lies, everything is crafted for lies, that if I stop it and comment at each point, I'll never be able to air it.
[02:44:56.980 --> 02:45:17.498]  Notice that it starts out identical to a DC piece, and then they sell the whole thing like the people want it, and it's bad teenagers, and the parents are scared, and the parents call the cops to come out and confiscate the guns.
[02:45:17.498 --> 02:45:24.664]  Now, in DC, in New York, in Dallas, in Tucson, in many other cities,
[02:45:28.280 --> 02:45:31.385]  Of course, there's also, it's going on in Boston.
[02:45:31.385 --> 02:45:38.938]  This is just so amazing, people understand the import of what we're talking about here.
[02:45:38.938 --> 02:45:40.120]  They come in and
[02:45:46.275 --> 02:45:50.518]  They come to your door and they say, do you have any legal guns?
[02:45:50.518 --> 02:45:51.759]  Well, why won't you let me in?
[02:45:51.759 --> 02:45:53.300]  Well, you need to let me search.
[02:45:53.300 --> 02:45:59.183]  Or if it's in Dallas or other areas that are pro-gun and still have some second amendment, they say, mind if I do a safety inspection?
[02:45:59.183 --> 02:46:00.564]  That's all been in the newspapers.
[02:46:00.564 --> 02:46:03.306]  We've been covering it for about eight years.
[02:46:03.306 --> 02:46:06.948]  Seven, eight years since we learned it was going on in Tucson and Dallas.
[02:46:06.948 --> 02:46:08.249]  And they call that knock and talk.
[02:46:08.249 --> 02:46:13.693]  Now this new one, they admit, they go to doors and they ask and say, we want to search for illegal guns, mind if we search?
[02:46:14.657 --> 02:46:19.620]  But then when they get criticized, they come back with, oh, the parents call us.
[02:46:19.620 --> 02:46:21.520]  The parents want their kids to be safe.
[02:46:21.520 --> 02:46:23.962]  But don't worry, we're not going to prosecute them.
[02:46:23.962 --> 02:46:28.344]  But then now they're having to admit, well, actually, we do look for marijuana, and we do prosecute you.
[02:46:28.344 --> 02:46:29.564]  So it's also a lie.
[02:46:29.564 --> 02:46:31.986]  I mean, they lie to the public.
[02:46:31.986 --> 02:46:34.067]  It's a military operation.
[02:46:34.067 --> 02:46:35.207]  And remember New Orleans?
[02:46:35.207 --> 02:46:37.788]  First thing they did, they wouldn't bring food and water in for five days.
[02:46:37.788 --> 02:46:40.690]  They went into high and dry areas, wealthy areas, and took the guns.
[02:46:41.912 --> 02:46:47.573]  So, we're going to play this Oakland piece that's total deception with women saying they love it, they want it.
[02:46:47.573 --> 02:46:50.534]  Kind of like deceptive pieces that say, hey, everybody ought to take their shots.
[02:46:50.534 --> 02:46:51.634]  It's the law.
[02:46:51.634 --> 02:46:53.555]  I don't want my babies to be sick.
[02:46:53.555 --> 02:46:55.755]  We have similar pieces with the forced inoculations.
[02:46:55.755 --> 02:46:56.516]  But it's not the law.
[02:46:56.516 --> 02:46:59.256]  They just say it's the law and threaten you.
[02:46:59.256 --> 02:47:00.617]  It's just, look.
[02:47:00.617 --> 02:47:02.417]  This is so incredibly deceptive.
[02:47:02.417 --> 02:47:06.138]  I'm going to play the piece out of Oakland first, then the piece out of D.C.
[02:47:06.138 --> 02:47:07.338]  Here it is.
[02:47:07.338 --> 02:47:10.559]  Would you invite police into your home to look for guns?
[02:47:11.451 --> 02:47:17.778]  Robert Lyles on a proposal in Oakland that would have officers searching houses for weapons without a warrant.
[02:47:17.778 --> 02:47:18.379]  Robert?
[02:47:18.379 --> 02:47:24.566]  Well Ken, a fundamental constitutional right is the right against unlawful search and seizure inside your home.
[02:47:24.566 --> 02:47:31.014]  That's why some here in Oakland were surprised to hear that a plan has been green-lighted that would allow police
[02:47:31.554 --> 02:47:33.555]  Inside your home without that warrant.
[02:47:33.555 --> 02:47:36.816]  Now, as you're about to hear, supporters say you lose nothing.
[02:47:36.816 --> 02:47:44.198]  But civil libertarians say if this passes, there's no telling what you may lose.
[02:47:44.198 --> 02:47:45.719]  Your home may be your castle.
[02:47:47.518 --> 02:47:51.841]  But by summer, you could receive a rap from an Oakland cop looking for guns.
[02:47:51.841 --> 02:47:53.162]  This is about consent.
[02:47:53.162 --> 02:47:56.425]  So nobody's going into anybody's home who doesn't give permission.
[02:47:56.425 --> 02:48:01.049]  Oakland council member, Desley Brooks, has proposed something unheard of in California.
[02:48:01.049 --> 02:48:03.410]  A consent to search program.
[02:48:03.410 --> 02:48:11.577]  Instead of cops gathering a warrant seeking a gun that may have been involved in a crime, homeowners call the cops and voluntarily let them in.
[02:48:12.197 --> 02:48:18.205]  Under this pilot program, the gun is removed and no criminal actions are pursued, with one exception.
[02:48:18.205 --> 02:48:24.934]  If the guns have been involved in a homicide or a shooting, obviously we have to look at those issues and we have to follow up.
[02:48:25.928 --> 02:48:31.311]  With Oakland's murder rate at nearly 40 lives, the pilot program isn't hard to sell to some.
[02:48:31.311 --> 02:48:32.372]  I think it's a good idea.
[02:48:32.372 --> 02:48:35.534]  I would call the police because I wouldn't want no gun in my home.
[02:48:35.534 --> 02:48:37.214]  Consent to search isn't new.
[02:48:37.214 --> 02:48:38.155]  Homeowners in St.
[02:48:38.155 --> 02:48:40.696]  Louis, Boston, and Washington, D.C.
[02:48:40.696 --> 02:48:43.198]  have already allowed cops in looking for guns.
[02:48:43.198 --> 02:48:45.599]  Okay, stop right there.
[02:48:45.599 --> 02:48:46.900]  See, that's what this is meant for.
[02:48:46.900 --> 02:48:50.122]  The perception that, well, we've already done this before.
[02:48:50.122 --> 02:48:54.704]  I mean, why didn't Jeffrey Dahmer say, hey, when the cops showed up, hey, I've killed people before.
[02:48:54.704 --> 02:48:55.465]  Why is it wrong now?
[02:48:56.508 --> 02:49:07.896]  Just a big positive piece, the image of police coming and searching for guns in a city like Oakland where they don't have a lot of gun laws compared to other parts of California.
[02:49:07.896 --> 02:49:10.077]  Now here's the other newscast out of D.C.
[02:49:10.077 --> 02:49:13.580]  where you got police saying it's horrible and it's unconstitutional.
[02:49:13.580 --> 02:49:15.141]  This is the difference.
[02:49:15.141 --> 02:49:18.083]  This is an honest news piece versus a pack of liars.
[02:49:18.083 --> 02:49:18.423]  Here it is.
[02:49:19.215 --> 02:49:22.139]  They say they have more requests than they can respond to.
[02:49:22.139 --> 02:49:25.023]  But others think Brooks' plan is a slippery slope.
[02:49:25.023 --> 02:49:32.312]  If a cop can enter a house, or anybody can enter a house without a warrant for guns, then they could enter a house for something else.
[02:49:32.312 --> 02:49:35.136]  That's exactly what makes the ACLU nervous.
[02:49:35.516 --> 02:49:42.762]  They tell CBS 5 as it stands, many people don't know they have the right to refuse a police request to enter their home.
[02:49:42.762 --> 02:49:50.108]  And once a cop is inside a home, the ACLU sees nothing in the pilot program that limits the scope of the police search.
[02:49:50.108 --> 02:49:55.553]  And that bowls over those who think consent to search is license to trample over the Constitution.
[02:49:55.553 --> 02:50:00.217]  You want your own house searched?
[02:50:00.217 --> 02:50:03.460]  That's a concept I'd have to... That's a new one on me.
[02:50:04.910 --> 02:50:09.034]  No, consent to search goes before the full council on Tuesday.
[02:50:09.034 --> 02:50:11.015]  If it passes... Stop right there.
[02:50:11.015 --> 02:50:12.417]  John, you misunderstood me.
[02:50:12.417 --> 02:50:14.238]  It's a DC piece.
[02:50:14.238 --> 02:50:15.940]  That was a pretty good one, too.
[02:50:15.940 --> 02:50:21.945]  It's a DC piece with police saying they don't like it and it's unconstitutional.
[02:50:21.945 --> 02:50:22.766]  It doesn't matter.
[02:50:22.766 --> 02:50:27.490]  The point is, this is the United States, not Soviet Russia or Nazi Germany.
[02:50:28.391 --> 02:50:29.011]  It is a big idea.
[02:50:50.532 --> 02:50:52.293]  A New World Order.
[02:50:52.293 --> 02:50:57.194]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:50:57.194 --> 02:51:00.035]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:51:00.035 --> 02:51:02.816]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:51:02.816 --> 02:51:05.997]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:51:05.997 --> 02:51:13.320]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:51:16.354 --> 02:51:21.798]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:51:21.798 --> 02:51:25.180]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:51:46.254 --> 02:51:47.294]  We're good to go!
[02:52:14.005 --> 02:52:15.746]  Most people are overly acidic.
[02:52:15.746 --> 02:52:19.547]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[02:52:19.547 --> 02:52:24.369]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[02:52:24.369 --> 02:52:25.409]  Do your part.
[02:52:25.409 --> 02:52:28.010]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now!

[02:53:48.672 --> 02:53:53.615]  Alright, there's a bold new program going into effect in Boston, raising a lot of eyebrows.
[02:53:53.615 --> 02:53:54.275]  Mine included.
[02:53:54.275 --> 02:53:55.496]  See my eyebrow going up?
[02:53:55.496 --> 02:54:05.001]  Police call it Safe Homes, and it allows officers to enter a person's home and search their kids' bedrooms for guns, all without a warrant.
[02:54:05.001 --> 02:54:07.582]  Parents are free to turn down these searches.
[02:54:07.582 --> 02:54:08.542]  John, I wasn't clear.
[02:54:08.542 --> 02:54:09.363]  It's another D.C.
[02:54:09.363 --> 02:54:10.583]  when we aired about two weeks ago.
[02:54:10.583 --> 02:54:11.444]  It's a local D.C.
[02:54:11.444 --> 02:54:12.544]  report.
[02:54:12.544 --> 02:54:15.526]  There's just too many of these reports to get the one on there, so it's fine.
[02:54:16.602 --> 02:54:17.703]  Maybe see if you can find it.
[02:54:17.703 --> 02:54:19.584]  I just want you to hear the police, folks.
[02:54:19.584 --> 02:54:22.366]  We've heard it before, saying this is illegal.
[02:54:22.366 --> 02:54:24.308]  And it has nothing to do with children.
[02:54:24.308 --> 02:54:29.892]  Once they find out that people are upset about this, they go, well, we're just looking for your kids' guns, not yours.
[02:54:29.892 --> 02:54:32.894]  And they got a police chief in there admitting, well, you really don't get amnesty.
[02:54:32.894 --> 02:54:34.975]  We're gonna go ahead and take you to jail.
[02:54:34.975 --> 02:54:38.097]  Don't let the cops in your house without a warrant.
[02:54:38.097 --> 02:54:39.959]  But, I mean, that's what they do now.
[02:54:39.959 --> 02:54:44.242]  That's what Bobbitt's saying, and he's one of the top planners for The Globalist.
[02:54:45.835 --> 02:54:49.178]  He's running around saying, hey, just get rid of the Constitution, get rid of the Bill of Rights.
[02:54:49.178 --> 02:54:51.459]  Everything must go.
[02:54:51.459 --> 02:54:55.422]  The whole thing has to go.
[02:54:55.422 --> 02:55:01.146]  We have to get rid of that evil freedom.
[02:55:01.146 --> 02:55:02.868]  It's causing too many problems.
[02:55:02.868 --> 02:55:04.269]  Now look, I'm going to start the fourth hour.
[02:55:04.269 --> 02:55:07.151]  And I'm going to take your phone calls at 512-646-5400.
[02:55:07.151 --> 02:55:09.552]  Starting next Monday, the show will be on the network.
[02:55:13.487 --> 02:55:17.848]  And on the Starguide satellite and all of it for stations that want it from 11 a.m.
[02:55:17.848 --> 02:55:18.529]  to 3 p.m.
[02:55:18.529 --> 02:55:24.250]  The added hour will be done beta testing this week and it'll be live on the network.
[02:55:24.250 --> 02:55:33.913]  Four hours the added fourth hour next Monday but until Monday the one place to listen is InfoWars.com to the fourth hour.
[02:55:33.913 --> 02:55:42.476]  You can go to InfoWars.com and dial in right there listen to the free internet stream or if you're a PrisonPlanet.tv member
[02:55:43.668 --> 02:55:58.453]  You can simply go to PrisonPlanet.TV, get a 15 cent a day membership and see the two different video cams we've gotten here on the guest and myself, a document cam, video clips we play, and a lot more, adding a whole other dimension to this during that live fourth hour.
[02:55:58.453 --> 02:56:03.935]  We then take that archive and post it for the PrisonPlanet.TV members up there on the site.
[02:56:03.935 --> 02:56:09.057]  Also, not only PrisonPlanet.TV makes this broadcast possible, but also InnerFood,
[02:56:10.030 --> 02:56:14.795]  Great folks, Patriots, good friends with George Humphrey right here in Austin, Texas.
[02:56:14.795 --> 02:56:19.520]  Interfood is the best green food out there and I've tried a lot of them.
[02:56:19.520 --> 02:56:26.347]  It's got 20 different well-known superfoods that are so good for you like Dulse Kelp, Barleygrass, Wheatgrass, Corolina, Spirulina.
[02:56:27.065 --> 02:56:27.285]  I think so.
[02:56:45.923 --> 02:56:54.417]  You can get 10% off their banner on my website as well, www.interfood.com or 866-762-9238.
[02:56:54.417 --> 02:57:00.187]  Another great sponsor, we have a banner up on www.infowars.com, look for it, the new Vitality banner.
[02:57:01.016 --> 02:57:16.729]  By linking through there, you can see the hundreds of well-documented, high-quality, nutritive and health products that they have, like Aloe Ease, Colon and Body Cleanse, Aloe Vera, very well-known for cleaning out your GI, 1-800-569-4056, 1-800-569-4056, Aloe, Colon and Body Cleanse, and also their Super Beta Prostate Formula, 1-800-569-4056.
[02:57:27.012 --> 02:57:29.874]  Okay, here is a report out of Heratz.
[02:57:29.874 --> 02:57:31.576]  This is just breaking.
[02:57:31.576 --> 02:57:34.918]  This is the largest paper in Israel, Heratz.
[02:57:34.918 --> 02:57:38.941]  Netanyahu says 9-11 terror attacks good for Israel.
[02:57:38.941 --> 02:57:40.803]  Absolutely arrogant, wicked statement.
[02:57:40.803 --> 02:57:42.524]  We'll cover that after your calls.
[02:57:42.524 --> 02:57:45.526]  Also, insiders in Israel say the U.S.
[02:57:45.526 --> 02:57:47.128]  is going to be hitting.
[02:57:48.172 --> 02:57:52.394]  Is, repeat, is going to be hitting Iran.
[02:57:52.394 --> 02:57:55.535]  I forgot to get to that in the first three hours.
[02:57:55.535 --> 02:57:58.876]  I have this tendency when I really start covering the news, this is what happens.
[02:57:58.876 --> 02:58:00.556]  Luckily we got a fourth hour.
[02:58:00.556 --> 02:58:10.640]  First your phone calls at 512-646-5400 in the fourth hour and then I'll get into what's happening with Israel and their other report.
[02:58:11.873 --> 02:58:25.282]  about the government wanting to wrap its mind around your mind that and Israel coming up in the fourth overdrive hour starting right now at the video and audio streams at InfoWars.com.
