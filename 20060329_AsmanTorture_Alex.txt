[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800]  Moussaoui continuing today, Moussaoui stunning the court yesterday when he testified he was
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.240]  supposed to pilot a plane on 9-11 and ram it into the White House.
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:14.560]  Moussaoui was arrested August 16, 2001, just about a month before the September 11th attacks,
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:19.660]  and he's now admitted to lying about his involvement in 9-11 so the attacks could go forward.
[00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.520]  So would 9-11 have been prevented if we had simply tortured Moussaoui to get the truth
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.520]  out of him?
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.880]  Let's ask the host of War Stories, Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North.
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:30.880]  What do you say?
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:31.880]  Torture?
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:32.880]  No, David.
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.360]  I don't think you can find anybody in the government of the United States, military,
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.760]  FBI, the intelligence services, who would say that torture is a good idea.
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.600]  Let's just, you and I agree on the term, harsh interrogation methods.
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.880]  How far does that go?
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:45.880]  Intimidation.
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:46.880]  In other words, threats.
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:47.880]  For example?
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.880]  If you don't answer me, I'm going to take you out and shoot you.
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.880]  In other words, the threat articulated in the way that they understand.
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.380]  You know, the U.N. might call that torture.
[00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.240]  Well, some people would, but that, by the way, is not banned by any convention that
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.160]  we're a signatory to.
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.280]  The difficulty with this guy Moussaoui is, one, he was apprehended before 9-11.
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.880]  He has spun so many different stories at this point, he's now really undermining the prosecution
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:11.880]  case for the death penalty.
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.400]  But Colonel, let's say he's telling the truth this one time that he had information that
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.360]  could have prevented 9-11 before it happened.
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.720]  Would we have been justified in torturing the guy to get that information out?
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:23.840]  Not if you're going to prosecute him.
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.240]  I mean, the real difficulty here, and this goes back to the heart of this whole debate
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.280]  over NSA wiretapping, over what kind of surveillance we're allowed to use.
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.120]  If it's for foreign intelligence purposes to prevent something, you have a lot more
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.300]  latitude than if you're going to go ahead and then prosecute them.
[00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.700]  The difficulty with the whole Moussaoui case was it began as a foreign intelligence operation.
[00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.560]  The FBI agent who was in charge of it testified to that.
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.520]  It then turned into a criminal prosecution.
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.600]  At that point, a lot of the evidence you've gathered leading up to this, and I'm certainly
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.240]  no lawyer, but a lot of the evidence gathered up to that point is no longer relevant in
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.240]  the trial.
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.120]  And that's what you've got right now with this guy who has proven, I think, that he's
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.040]  got a lot of different stories to tell.
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.000]  He's very proud of the role that he's played in this whole thing.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.680]  No, clearly, there's a lot of bragging going on and so forth.
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.560]  But let's take it a step further, and it's not unreasonable, as I'm sure you'd agree.
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.280]  What happens if we had information that a nuclear weapon was going to go off?
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.360]  We had in our hands somebody who we thought could tell us where that nuke was going to
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.360]  go off.
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.800]  Where do we be justified in that case in torturing the guy?
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.080]  I think the evidence shows, broadly, and this goes for military interrogations as well as
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:38.680]  intelligence operations, David, that as a general practice, torture does not work.
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.840]  And the evidence that's been certainly collected in places like the Hanoi Hilton, where I'm
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.660]  going to be in just a few more weeks, in Vietnam, proves that torture itself does not get the
[00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.560]  kind of information or divulge the kind of information.
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.360]  Somebody who was in the Hanoi Hilton, John McCain, agrees with you that he says torture
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.600]  doesn't work.
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.760]  And I think, broadly, most people agree with that.
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.620]  Harsh interrogation methods, but, again, the kind of information you're extracting under
[00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.440]  those circumstances may be no more valid than what we're hearing from this guy now.
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.760]  War stories is all about conflicts that have happened in the past.
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.000]  You're an expert in that.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.600]  The French, didn't they use torture effectively to find the jackal, the guy that was going
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.080]  to kill the president of France?
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.040]  The rumor is, and according to some of the reports that have been rendered, yes.
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.080]  And there have been lots of stories about other intelligence services doing that.
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.320]  So it does work sometimes.
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:28.320]  One of the reasons why it's difficult to send some of these characters back to their countries
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.640]  of origin is the fear of them being tortured by their own intelligence or police services.
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.120]  Very quick related question on Iraq.
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.800]  What do you do when the enemy uses a religious shrine as a base of operations?
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.800]  Well, look, when fired upon, you've got to fire back.
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.560]  That's the rules of engagement that we've had in this war ever since it began on the
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.600]  20th of March, 2003.
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.920]  It's the same rules of engagement that have been used in Afghanistan.
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.920]  And one of the problems we've got today, David, is that the disinformation that is
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:02.080]  being worked with the use of the American media by putting out propaganda on their part
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.360]  and us being unable to respond in kind is very, very difficult to overcome.
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.840]  That's one of the things we're facing, some of these charges coming out of Iraq.
