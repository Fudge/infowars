[00:00.000 --> 00:15.240]  The
[00:15.240 --> 00:21.560]  most banned of the most banned of the big mega tech titans and the corrupt armies of
[00:21.560 --> 00:28.240]  anti-free speech SJWs, Facebook put out a statement yesterday and they said, before
[00:28.240 --> 00:34.360]  people we've banned three being conservatives, Farrakhan was the cover to make it look political.
[00:34.360 --> 00:43.400]  Alex Jones is a new category. His name and his website will not be spoken or texted.
[00:43.400 --> 00:47.680]  They even got live systems now on their apps where they're going to listen to what you're
[00:47.680 --> 00:56.640]  saying in a lifetime. And if you speak the word, Alex Jones, you will be banned. Unbelievable.
[00:56.640 --> 01:02.560]  20,000 Southern Private Law Center operatives now inside Facebook. This is an incredible
[01:02.560 --> 01:10.840]  time to be alive. Ladies and gentlemen, it all crystallized at about 5.30 in the morning.
[01:10.840 --> 01:15.080]  I went to bed last night at about 10. I got up at 5.30, took a shower, had some coffee
[01:15.080 --> 01:21.880]  at about 5.45. Everything crystallized. And then I got on the phone with three different
[01:21.880 --> 01:26.760]  lawyers this morning and discussed it all with them and they said, absolutely, this
[01:26.760 --> 01:34.480]  is the lawsuit. We have them. You remember a month ago, back in late March, a little
[01:34.480 --> 01:42.400]  over a month ago, those internal emails came out and Business Insider of Facebook and their
[01:42.400 --> 01:49.760]  own people saying Jones is not making anti-semitic remarks. And so we can't take him down. And
[01:49.760 --> 01:53.360]  then that was leaked out to the press and they put pressure on him. So they went ahead
[01:53.360 --> 01:57.440]  with it and said I was anti-semitic and banned me. It'd be one thing if you argue you're
[01:57.440 --> 02:01.440]  a private company, you can ban somebody. But you're going to surveil your users in real
[02:01.440 --> 02:05.120]  time and tell them what words they can use or what they can discuss. And you're then
[02:05.120 --> 02:10.840]  going to put out a giant press release saying that I'm a hate leader when your own internal
[02:10.840 --> 02:15.560]  findings were it wasn't true. And so what have I was? Everybody deserves free speech.
[02:15.560 --> 02:22.080]  But I'm not. So you have defamed me while trying to bankrupt me and stop my free speech.
[02:22.080 --> 02:28.840]  This is authoritarianism, writ large. And when it rains, it pours. Paul Watson was supposed
[02:28.840 --> 02:33.120]  to be on the day. He's got a very ill family member. So I'm going to be private about that,
[02:33.120 --> 02:39.240]  but pray for Paul and his parents and Steve. Paul, I wouldn't even say he's devastated.
[02:39.240 --> 02:43.960]  He's really upset about humanity. People are calling me saying, how are you handling this?
[02:43.960 --> 02:49.480]  I mean, I'm fine. I'm not any of these things they say, but we've got some serious criminals
[02:49.480 --> 02:55.520]  here. And MasterCards announcing they're going to monitor all your purchases now. And if
[02:55.520 --> 02:58.680]  they think you buy it a hate site, you're going to be banned from using it. This is the
[02:58.680 --> 03:03.520]  Chinese social credit score. And so many people I know are deciding to just say, well, I'm
[03:03.520 --> 03:09.960]  going to submit to it. My God, are we Americans or what the hell are we? Well, Alex, these
[03:09.960 --> 03:18.160]  are mobsters. We better back down. Wow. We've really turned into a nation of chicken necks.
[03:18.160 --> 03:21.560]  Not this great audience, though. They fear you because of your strength and your will.
[03:21.560 --> 03:26.680]  But I fired the bat signal out yesterday. Halfway through the show, I found out this
[03:26.680 --> 03:32.000]  was happening. We had important coverage of it, but I was still floundering around, met
[03:32.000 --> 03:35.840]  three hours with Robert Barnes, a great lawyer who was here. We figured a lot of this out.
[03:35.840 --> 03:40.440]  We went over the documents together until about nine at night, and then it all hit this morning.
[03:40.440 --> 03:43.080]  So I'm going to fire the bat signal again. I'm not mad at the drugs. Doesn't link at
[03:43.080 --> 03:51.960]  the top again, but I'm going to lay out for you total smoking gun, their internal emails,
[03:51.960 --> 03:56.640]  which their own people leaked, but I'm now going to bite them in the ass. Royal where
[03:56.640 --> 04:01.200]  they said this man has done nothing like Pontius Pilots said. I'm a comparison to Christ, but
[04:01.200 --> 04:06.280]  it's the same deal. They said we don't like him. We're liberals, but he's not done anything
[04:06.280 --> 04:15.040]  they say he's done. And they said you will crucify him. And they washed their hands.
[04:15.040 --> 04:23.600]  It's all right here. This is incredible. So they go after Farrakhan, who has said anti-Jewish
[04:23.600 --> 04:27.520]  stuff. That's his right to say it. I don't agree with it, but that's his right to throw
[04:27.520 --> 04:33.480]  him in the grab bag. And you had all the concerted media. They jumped the gun hundreds of papers
[04:33.480 --> 04:37.920]  an hour before it said Jones has been taken down. It's like, Oh, you went an hour early
[04:37.920 --> 04:44.880]  all coordinated by Oliver Darcy. And then Oliver Darcy says that he wants conservatives
[04:44.880 --> 04:51.800]  banned off of any texting app where you can't even text your family. Yes, ladies and gentlemen,
[04:51.800 --> 05:00.400]  the authoritarians are here and they're moving against humanity. Trump must take action.
[05:00.400 --> 05:04.400]  infowarstore.com is how you support us. And it's not like we're selling stuff you don't
[05:04.400 --> 05:10.160]  need. You don't want the air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put
[05:10.160 --> 05:16.440]  it on par with a major city. There's some of the most polluted areas on earth are major
[05:16.440 --> 05:21.840]  cities. How can I solve that problem? So we have air filters at infowarstore.com, the
[05:21.840 --> 05:29.640]  Alexa pure breeze, which is right now $50 off the Alexa pure breeze groundbreaking iron

[05:35.520 --> 05:40.240]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul. Go ahead and read
[05:40.240 --> 05:46.640]  the hundreds of five star reviews for yourself. I've got two in my home. You will notice the
[05:46.640 --> 05:52.840]  difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa pure breeze in your house. Don't live
[05:52.840 --> 06:04.760]  in a polluted major city in your home. Have clean air. Go to infowarstore.com. Waging war
[06:04.760 --> 06:13.320]  on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[06:13.320 --> 06:41.360]  Well, I don't want to say that I'm pleased as punch today, but I'm pretty darn close.
[06:41.360 --> 06:46.880]  The globalists are already censoring and surveilling and big brothering everybody at levels light
[06:46.880 --> 06:53.440]  years down a black hole compared to 1984 and George R. Wells nightmare vision. They're
[06:53.440 --> 06:58.640]  just rolling the censorship out and letting you know about the control and the surveillance
[06:58.640 --> 07:07.920]  using straw man that they've built up. Lewis Farrakhan's Alex Joneses. So they can then
[07:07.920 --> 07:12.680]  have you accept it when you're really accepting your own fate and your own doom. Now I've been
[07:12.680 --> 07:23.560]  on the air 24 and a half years and I'm about to lay out for you ladies and gentlemen. Information
[07:23.560 --> 07:35.880]  that is hands down the most important information I've ever covered. Ever been driving through
[07:35.880 --> 07:41.160]  the fog in the mountains, you come around a turn, the fog's gone, you see the sun rising,
[07:41.160 --> 07:47.120]  you can see 50 miles and it's just incredibly clear. You can look down the valleys and you
[07:47.120 --> 07:52.760]  can see the stars still out even though the sun's coming up. You ever have one of those
[07:52.760 --> 07:59.720]  magic moments? This is the opposite of that. I've got all the pieces and I've been too
[07:59.720 --> 08:04.880]  close to the problem for a while, but last night and this morning, you're all crystallized.
[08:04.880 --> 08:10.840]  We have their exact battle plan, how they're going to roll it out. But you would only know
[08:10.840 --> 08:15.880]  this if you were engrossed in it, if you were focused on it and if you were experiencing
[08:15.880 --> 08:20.980]  the attacks and illegal battles with these individuals and all of their different operatives
[08:20.980 --> 08:25.840]  to then see the scripting, the coordination and then even get the documents where they're
[08:25.840 --> 08:34.200]  coordinating it. The live feed is up on infowars.com. It's titled Smoking Gun. Internal Facebook
[08:34.200 --> 08:41.400]  Docs Reveal Plan to Muzzle Conservatives Ahead of 2020. Facebook admits Jones banned for
[08:41.400 --> 08:49.000]  political reasons, not anti-Semitism. Now I want to explain to everybody listening,
[08:49.000 --> 08:53.440]  please, this is not about Alex Jones. This is not about Lewis Farrakhan. This is not
[08:53.440 --> 09:00.560]  about Milo Yiannopoulos. This is not about Laura Loomer. This is about the total rollout
[09:00.560 --> 09:07.440]  for complete and total censorship. It is being announced in the name of defeating me and
[09:07.440 --> 09:12.800]  you, the populist, that they're going to ban links in live time. They're going to have
[09:12.800 --> 09:18.600]  moderators on your phone when you have an app through any of these companies, including
[09:18.600 --> 09:24.040]  Facebook, that are going to be watching what you're watching and doing and reading your
[09:24.040 --> 09:29.720]  text messages. You're like, well, yeah, they already have Alex in my house. Listen to me.
[09:29.720 --> 09:36.520]  Think about the magnitude of that. Remember Oliver Darcy two years ago was inside my YouTube
[09:36.520 --> 09:43.120]  account and was reporting on who our sponsors were and how much I was being paid. Just like
[09:43.120 --> 09:48.280]  Facebook is giving all their internal documents to Business Insider and Atlantic Monthly to
[09:48.280 --> 09:56.920]  talk about all this private stuff. This is criminal. These are corporations with your
[09:56.920 --> 10:02.840]  information teamed up with Big Tech to slaughter free speech and surveil people. Oliver Darcy
[10:02.840 --> 10:08.360]  said yesterday, we're going to play the clip. Get ready for this, that they're going to
[10:08.360 --> 10:17.880]  ban people talking to each other over the phone in live time and text messages. He said,
[10:17.880 --> 10:23.000]  we're looking to see if Jones has an iPhone right now. We're in his iPhone. He says it's
[10:23.000 --> 10:31.040]  on air and we're seeing if he's got WhatsApp, which is just where you text message or call
[10:31.040 --> 10:38.400]  people. Now it's down to you talking to your mama and he's on there saying, well, we know
[10:38.400 --> 10:42.360]  he's got an iPhone, but we're checking into it right now to see if he's see what he's
[10:42.360 --> 10:50.880]  doing because Brazil got their new great president elected via text messages. I've been telling
[10:50.880 --> 10:57.160]  you folks, circumnavigate them with text messages. Now they want your text messages, the arrogance
[10:57.160 --> 11:04.080]  of CNN. So let me lay out the big quadrants here of bombshell info. Number one, they admit
[11:04.080 --> 11:11.320]  AI is now censoring in live time with machine learning, working with 20,000 SJW Southern
[11:11.320 --> 11:16.640]  Poverty Law Center trained individuals. This is all public. They've now turned AI on with
[11:16.640 --> 11:22.080]  humans working with it to train it to know what a satire is because the machine still
[11:22.080 --> 11:27.080]  can't tell if something satire like everybody's now saying Alex Jones is deplorable. Alex
[11:27.080 --> 11:30.440]  Jones is evil and then putting my stuff out because Facebook said as long as you'd decry
[11:30.440 --> 11:35.760]  him and say he's bad, you can talk about it. Any positive, you were banned or it's removed
[11:35.760 --> 11:39.480]  and it's currently happening. It's all over the news where thousands of emails are coming
[11:39.480 --> 11:46.720]  and it's happening to everyone. It's in live time, but the computers can't tell if you say
[11:46.720 --> 11:51.720]  he's a child molester. I hate Alex Jones. He's worse than Satan. They let it go through
[11:51.720 --> 11:56.080]  and you all have my permission. You can say Jones is Satan. He's the scum of the earth.
[11:56.080 --> 12:01.760]  Here's a link to a show and listen to this devil. But that's why there's still the humans
[12:01.760 --> 12:08.400]  overseeing it. It flags by the AI. They go in. This is all admitted and then they decide
[12:08.400 --> 12:15.160]  is that satire or is that serious? But they're SJWs. They're sociopaths. They're lacking
[12:15.160 --> 12:19.880]  souls. We've kind of figured out. They can't tell either because they're not human either.
[12:19.880 --> 12:25.000]  Ooh, that's a big secret, isn't it? Yeah, they don't have their humanity. It's very
[12:25.000 --> 12:29.000]  sad, but see this is happening. Now, let's get into this right now. That's why they
[12:29.000 --> 12:36.400]  can't mean. This is so incredible. Ladies and gentlemen, they're saying if you say
[12:36.400 --> 12:41.720]  my name or info wars in even just a neutral light, this is an official press release,
[12:41.720 --> 12:45.280]  you will be banned. The outrageousness of that is next level. And of course, that'll
[12:45.280 --> 12:49.560]  be deployed against everybody. That's the rollout. I'm just the rollout first time
[12:49.560 --> 12:58.160]  I know. Then they admit that they're surveilling all of you in live time while they do that
[12:58.160 --> 13:03.280]  and are in your phone and in your computer and in your devices. This is just Facebook.
[13:03.280 --> 13:09.320]  They're all doing it. All the big tech giants. This is the architecture. This is the plan.
[13:09.320 --> 13:15.620]  And on top of it, in their own internal documents, they admit that they are censoring conservatives
[13:15.620 --> 13:19.920]  and framing them and designating them so they can be banned and admitting that I'm really
[13:19.920 --> 13:25.520]  not an anti semi. So they say he's not guilty of this, but we'll just say he is. And so
[13:25.520 --> 13:36.040]  then there's the defamation. So there's so many angles to this that it's just incredible.
[13:36.040 --> 13:42.120]  They're surveilling you. They're going to control who you can call and who you can text message.
[13:42.120 --> 13:48.080]  Oh, it's a private company, though. No, folks, the Supreme Court rulings. They can't do this.
[13:48.080 --> 13:53.160]  It's all illegal. It's it's surveillance. It's immoral. And it's so horrible. And the
[13:53.160 --> 13:58.320]  dying corporate media is basically blackmailing the big tech giants to let them share the
[13:58.320 --> 14:04.520]  power and let them be part of the mop up crew ending freedom in the West. And so for
[14:04.520 --> 14:08.400]  the season or so, a few years, they'll still have jobs, but they're all going to be out
[14:08.400 --> 14:14.520]  of jobs too. I mean, this is such a betrayal of humanity, but they trained the anti free
[14:14.520 --> 14:19.680]  speech people to colleges. Now they're deploying what the Associated Press is calling today
[14:19.680 --> 14:26.160]  human rights committees into every major corporation like Mastercard, like a bioethics board that
[14:26.160 --> 14:32.600]  decides, you know, who lives who dies to where they're going to surveil with AI your purchases
[14:32.600 --> 14:38.600]  on Mastercard. And if they don't like what you're buying, they'll turn customers cards
[14:38.600 --> 14:44.840]  off now. It's not take Mastercard away from Alex Jones or take it away from Laura Loomer.
[14:44.840 --> 14:52.080]  It's already happening. It's take Mastercard from you. You're like, well, go to something
[14:52.080 --> 14:56.480]  else. No, they're buying it all up. It's here. Market the beast, folks, whether you believe
[14:56.480 --> 15:02.280]  in God or not, it's happening. And these people are reading Revelation, the last book of the
[15:02.280 --> 15:06.320]  New Testament, and they've decided that it's an owner's manual, that it's an operations
[15:06.320 --> 15:11.400]  guide, that it's a blueprint for something they're building. And they're doing it. They're
[15:11.400 --> 15:16.400]  manifesting it. They're building the system. And the churches won't say a word because
[15:16.400 --> 15:21.560]  they like all their digital stuff. They like being on Facebook. See how the Antichrist works?
[15:21.560 --> 15:31.280]  You see how it works. So this is unbelievable. All premeditated political setup. You say,
[15:31.280 --> 15:35.000]  well, why is it happening? Why won't Trump stop it? Because it's all the banks. It's
[15:35.000 --> 15:39.560]  all the corporations. The NSA runs it all. It's the architecture of the future, the
[15:39.560 --> 15:44.880]  big digital brain we all interface with and upload to. DARPA admits that's the plan. So
[15:44.880 --> 15:49.280]  that's what they built. That's what it is. It's always going to be that way. It was
[15:49.280 --> 15:56.560]  never not going to be that way. And now I am patient zero. I'm actually honored to have
[15:56.560 --> 15:59.400]  the Antichrist system banned me first.

[19:56.200 --> 20:06.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:26.200 --> 20:47.200]  I want to thank Matt Drudge, DrudgeReport.com, the second largest site in the world, the
[20:47.200 --> 20:52.680]  largest in the site in the world, for standing up, for free speech when so many other people
[20:52.680 --> 20:58.360]  have abandoned it and so many so-called conservatives are celebrating Farrakhan being censored. Farrakhan
[20:58.360 --> 21:03.280]  was thrown in because he's a hated figure by conservatives so that you would then accept
[21:03.280 --> 21:09.520]  censorship. It's a total trap. Let's go back to DrudgeReport.com. There's the headline
[21:09.520 --> 21:13.960]  Alex Jones fights back and that's exactly what's happening here. This evil system is
[21:13.960 --> 21:22.480]  going to come and go. When we look back on this time, people are going to be amazed that
[21:22.480 --> 21:28.040]  we ever led these companies put surveillance systems with microphones and cameras in our
[21:28.040 --> 21:33.560]  houses. I told you that was the plan 20 years ago. Almost everything we've talked about
[21:33.560 --> 21:38.680]  has turned out to be right because we're going off their own blueprints. And so I'm
[21:38.680 --> 21:43.720]  going to now lay out the facts here and I need people to send this link to thewhithouse.gov.
[21:43.720 --> 21:49.360]  I need people to tweet the link that's at drudgereport.com from infowarstore.com forward slash show.
[21:49.360 --> 21:53.400]  I need people to tweet the article that's posted on the page where we explain that we
[21:53.400 --> 22:02.000]  have the bomb shell internal documents where they admit that I didn't do anything anti-Semitic
[22:02.000 --> 22:05.800]  and that for political reasons they needed to designate me as a hate member, whatever
[22:05.800 --> 22:12.080]  that means, a hate leader so I could be unpersoned. Proof that I didn't even do what they said
[22:12.080 --> 22:17.000]  according to the rules and then instead of just banning me, they defamed me with an evil
[22:17.000 --> 22:25.080]  press release and said that I am the worst of the worst at a new level where anyone saying
[22:25.080 --> 22:35.880]  my name or my website will be banned or punished. That's like a movie like where the evil guy
[22:35.880 --> 22:44.200]  takes away somebody and if you ever say his name again, you'll go to the gulag. Good Lord!
[22:44.200 --> 22:54.800]  They have totally converted the colleges into authoritarian bastions. This country is dangerous
[22:54.800 --> 23:00.800]  now and I'll say this. I like President Trump a lot. He's done a lot of good and the enemy
[23:00.800 --> 23:05.280]  sure hates him. He's trying to get rid of him but he's not done enough and on this situation
[23:05.280 --> 23:10.120]  with the draconian censorship, he's only taken action at the colleges and I'm yet to see
[23:10.120 --> 23:14.280]  the government lawsuits over that when they ban people's speech but it's already had some
[23:14.280 --> 23:23.320]  effect. We need relief, Mr. President. We need it now. I am pro-Israel. Everybody's always
[23:23.320 --> 23:28.880]  known that. I've been on air 24 years and I think that Israel's a better nation than
[23:28.880 --> 23:32.600]  a lot of those other nations and there's no reason to turn it over to the Islamics. They'll
[23:32.600 --> 23:37.160]  blow it up. They'll fight over it like they always do. But the point is to say that I'm
[23:37.160 --> 23:42.880]  anti-Semitic. It's in all the news. It says, Jones banned Washington Post, New York Times,
[23:42.880 --> 23:50.040]  everywhere for anti-Semitic posts and he's anti-Semitic is really sick. I was so colorblind
[23:50.040 --> 23:56.400]  or blind to all that when I got married to my first wife who's half Jewish. I had no
[23:56.400 --> 23:59.840]  idea what I was getting myself into with the white supremacists or the things they'd said
[23:59.840 --> 24:07.880]  about my children and it's really evil of the leftist media and of leftist Jews in the
[24:07.880 --> 24:13.960]  media to call me an anti-Semite and then defend Ilhar Omar and all these real anti-Semites
[24:13.960 --> 24:17.160]  and all these other people that literally want to get rid of Israel. You guys are the
[24:17.160 --> 24:22.480]  scum of the earth. I don't care if you're black, white, old, young, Jewish, Christian,
[24:22.480 --> 24:27.480]  whatever. You know you're lying about me in the press and it just shows me what dirty
[24:27.480 --> 24:40.960]  sacks of garbage you are. What dirty sacks of garbage you are and that's what they called
[24:40.960 --> 24:47.800]  me in a bunch of headlines was Alex Jones is a sack of garbage. Really? Well you judge
[24:47.800 --> 24:51.480]  a tree by its fruits. I got a lot done. I have a lot of energy. I have a great life.
[24:51.480 --> 24:54.360]  I have a great family. I look at you leftist man and I'm telling you I didn't know they
[24:54.360 --> 24:59.960]  could stack trash that high and I don't feel good about that. I look at you and you don't
[24:59.960 --> 25:05.520]  have any honor. You don't have any will. You don't have any compassion and everything you
[25:05.520 --> 25:12.760]  say we are is what you are. I'm a libertarian. I believe in real freedom. I believe in egalitarianism.
[25:12.760 --> 25:20.080]  I believe in the West. I'm a liberal. You're not. You're leftist, left-hand path, power-mongering,
[25:20.080 --> 25:27.160]  court-cult of control freaks that are dangerous, that are classical authoritarians and you've
[25:27.160 --> 25:33.560]  been created on these universities and created through the television system in Hollywood.
[25:33.560 --> 25:36.560]  Unbelievable. So we're going to go to break. Longer segment coming up and I'm going to
[25:36.560 --> 25:42.120]  go through it all. CNN now says they want conservatives banned off of using text and
[25:42.120 --> 25:48.880]  phone call apps that are digital. This is all NSA technology. They can listen to you.
[25:48.880 --> 25:54.080]  They can control you. They can pop in and they're now just telling you they are. They're
[25:54.080 --> 25:56.560]  now saying they're going to take your credit cards away and they're going to watch the
[25:56.560 --> 26:05.720]  purchases you make and punish you with committees of human rights right out of Maoist China.
[26:05.720 --> 26:10.120]  I mean, folks, this is the Chinese model. Google and Apple and others went over there
[26:10.120 --> 26:18.400]  and set it up for them. These people are so dangerous and look at Zuckerberg and the
[26:18.400 --> 26:27.400]  power that he's on and his testimony and just who he is. It's disgusting. So these organizations
[26:27.400 --> 26:31.520]  are enemies of the people. They're enemies of open free societies and they're the ones
[26:31.520 --> 26:36.480]  that are dangerous and they're the ones that have a monopoly over the transfer of information.
[26:36.480 --> 26:42.320]  They almost have a monopoly and God help us if they get their monopoly. So again, I'm
[26:42.320 --> 26:50.080]  going to break this down. They are saying that if you share info wars or my name, unless
[26:50.080 --> 26:57.560]  it's negative, you'll be punished. That is reeducation camp behavior. By the way, I
[26:57.560 --> 27:03.000]  didn't see it in my stacks. You pull me the info wars article. It's up on info wars shirts
[27:03.000 --> 27:08.440]  here, but I missed it. He's now going to convert you to group living rooms where you won't
[27:08.440 --> 27:12.400]  be able to have your own private Facebook because they're already in it anyways. They're
[27:12.400 --> 27:15.200]  already in your living room. They're already in your photos. They're already got your pass
[27:15.200 --> 27:21.240]  codes. They're already shelling your dad, everybody in an orgy free for all. Now you're
[27:21.240 --> 27:25.720]  going to be in these living rooms with other people that they put you with for social engineering
[27:25.720 --> 27:30.860]  like a dorm and they're going to reeducate you and then they're going to decide your
[27:30.860 --> 27:35.320]  friends are going to decide what gets boosted and what doesn't. Again, that's literally
[27:35.320 --> 27:42.840]  a reeducation camp model. Facebook CEO promotes group living rooms. What Zuckerberg really
[27:42.840 --> 27:48.520]  after people can have more revealing intimate conversations. Yeah, how about you just take
[27:48.520 --> 27:51.840]  us over to the local sports stadium and play movies all night telling us how much America
[27:51.840 --> 27:56.080]  sucks and people that give in and turn against their families and title and join the club
[27:56.080 --> 28:01.800]  next week and be a guard inside the facility. I mean, we're getting classical reeducation
[28:01.800 --> 28:07.120]  camp garbage. Remember that was in the Army manual that Obama put out eight years ago.
[28:07.120 --> 28:15.840]  Classical reeducation camp garbage projected through the Internet. This is beyond authoritarian.
[28:15.840 --> 28:18.480]  So they're going to surveil you. They're going to watch you. They're going to track you and
[28:18.480 --> 28:23.480]  then they're going to defame you and tell lies about you and they want your car. They
[28:23.480 --> 28:27.560]  want your house. They want your bank account. They want your mind. They want your children.
[28:27.560 --> 28:37.440]  They want your soul. They want it all. We want your soul. That's it. Because after all,
[28:37.440 --> 28:40.320]  let him into your living room. You already got he already gives you devices where they
[28:40.320 --> 28:44.960]  listen and watch you little camera devices in your house for your family. The track you
[28:44.960 --> 28:49.200]  and now he's in your living room and he's going to tell you how to live. He's going
[28:49.200 --> 28:54.280]  to run your life. He's your cult leader. This is this is what big tech is. It's a big giant
[28:54.280 --> 29:00.000]  cult leader takeover with four companies bidding for command of the cult. Stocks and options
[29:00.000 --> 29:03.840]  trading involves financial risk and is not suitable for all investors. Hey guys, it's

[32:00.360 --> 32:05.600]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is. The real drama can be found
[32:05.600 --> 32:10.680]  here in Leilani estates, but a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we need
[32:10.680 --> 32:17.240]  to be concerned about ash and acid rain. Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles
[32:17.240 --> 32:22.520]  and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels. To find out, we employed
[32:22.520 --> 32:28.800]  a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity and pH. What we learned was that there was
[32:28.800 --> 32:34.320]  in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater. Next, we tested
[32:34.320 --> 32:39.400]  the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within
[32:39.400 --> 32:46.200]  safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels. As it turns out, the filter
[32:46.200 --> 32:51.840]  on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water. So what we've learned is that volcanic ash
[32:51.840 --> 32:57.280]  and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply. But more importantly, a good water
[32:57.280 --> 33:20.760]  filtration system will purify it.
[33:20.760 --> 33:38.720]  Let's take a look at what we've learned in Leilani estates in Leilani estates in Leilani
[33:38.720 --> 33:39.720]  estates.
[33:39.720 --> 33:57.680]  Let's take a look at what we've learned in Leilani estates in Leilani estates in Leilani
[33:57.680 --> 33:58.680]  estates.
[33:58.680 --> 34:16.640]  Let's take a look at what we've learned in Leilani estates in Leilani estates in Leilani
[34:16.640 --> 34:18.640]  estates in Leilani estates.
[34:18.640 --> 34:46.680]  In all the studies, all of them show that people's IQs are dropping, their brainwaves
[34:46.680 --> 34:50.560]  are dropping, they're not vigorous, they're not alive. The more you spend time on social
[34:50.560 --> 34:54.120]  media, the more depressed you are.
[34:54.120 --> 34:58.000]  Sean Parker, the former deputy head of Facebook, came out last year and said, we designed it
[34:58.000 --> 35:02.440]  to make you depressed and to run your life. And now we're going to replace real people
[35:02.440 --> 35:07.360]  with bots that control your life. And he said, I think it's immoral and people better watch
[35:07.360 --> 35:08.360]  out.
[35:08.360 --> 35:14.600]  So even forerunners in this who are pretty sociopathic have come out and said, you're
[35:14.600 --> 35:21.080]  in a lot of danger, you better watch out. Think about that.
[35:21.080 --> 35:26.480]  So I need everybody to go to infowars.com forward slash show. I need everybody to go
[35:26.480 --> 35:32.440]  to drudgereport.com and right from the left hand side is the links and send out that link.
[35:32.440 --> 35:36.840]  This could backfire on them. We need to fight back against it and say, oh, Alex Jones, you
[35:36.840 --> 35:40.480]  can't say the name Alex Jones, you can't say the name infowars.com. Well, then we're
[35:40.480 --> 35:44.280]  going to say it and play along with their sick game. I'm going to read the press release
[35:44.280 --> 35:49.760]  in a moment where it says, you can only say his name or his website if it is to condemn
[35:49.760 --> 35:55.280]  him and say he's bad. If you study authoritarian regimes, that's what they do. They make the
[35:55.280 --> 35:59.640]  public start decrying one person first, then it's another person, then it's a group, then
[35:59.640 --> 36:04.640]  it's everybody, then it's their own family, their own parents, their own children. This
[36:04.640 --> 36:09.000]  is 1984.
[36:09.000 --> 36:14.640]  If you just joined us, leaked emails reveal Facebook's intense internal discussions over
[36:14.640 --> 36:23.240]  Alex Jones anti-Semitic post. That's from back in March. Remember that? And then they
[36:23.240 --> 36:30.080]  said, well, he didn't say anything anti-Semitic. Well, the comments are anti-Semitic. We have
[36:30.080 --> 36:35.000]  these outside leftist publications wanting banned. They're reporting we're not doing
[36:35.000 --> 36:40.560]  enough. What do we do? And of course, they're playing a game with the media, Facebook directing
[36:40.560 --> 36:44.440]  this thing from the top. And we've got the internal documents. It's all coordinated.
[36:44.440 --> 36:47.600]  They go, well, if we could designate him a hate figure, we could ban him, but there's
[36:47.600 --> 36:53.000]  no evidence. They go, well, the comments, there's a few anti-Semitic comments in here.
[36:53.000 --> 37:01.600]  So they reviewed 560 comments in one post and said, well, only 4% are and the threshold
[37:01.600 --> 37:10.320]  is 30%. So they told everybody the threshold to then go make comments. So the SJW is then
[37:10.320 --> 37:14.160]  all from their college dormitories, their little jobs they've got interface, the Southern
[37:14.160 --> 37:18.320]  Private Law Center, their little computer interfaces, they all then go make their anti-Semitic
[37:18.320 --> 37:22.000]  comments. And we've run our own comments before. We can see the IP addresses. One guy'll say
[37:22.000 --> 37:25.640]  he's black and hates white people. Another guy says he's white and hates black people.
[37:25.640 --> 37:30.360]  It's the same IP address. It's the same person. It's the SJWs. Remember they tried to trick
[37:30.360 --> 37:35.720]  Candace Owens into joining him by having white supremacist threatener. It turned out it was
[37:35.720 --> 37:43.960]  feminist. It was CIA people. And CIA is not like James Bond or something. The CIA are
[37:43.960 --> 37:48.360]  just horrible, evil leftists who want to run the country and terrorize people and run
[37:48.360 --> 37:54.680]  false flags all day. That's who they are. Not all the CIA, but the bureaucratic ones
[37:54.680 --> 38:02.360]  that interface with the colleges and the infrastructures.
[38:02.360 --> 38:07.480]  People like Balazi Ford's family and the CIA program she runs, that's what they do.
[38:07.480 --> 38:11.760]  They all play damsel in distress. They all play little victims, but really they're managing
[38:11.760 --> 38:19.000]  the herd. They're very horrible people. So they say if he could be designated a hate
[38:19.000 --> 38:27.440]  figure, we could ban him. And then a month later, they get it all packaged already and
[38:27.440 --> 38:31.520]  roll out with the anti-Semitic angle in their press release but never show proof because
[38:31.520 --> 38:37.360]  it wasn't there. So see, this got countermanded by mid-level managers a month ago, but then
[38:37.360 --> 38:42.200]  it went up the flagpole and folks said, just go ahead and go with the plan. They go, well,
[38:42.200 --> 38:48.920]  he never said anything that we could lie about. Put Lewis Farrakhan in there. Put Lewis Farrakhan
[38:48.920 --> 38:52.480]  in there. He said stuff, which I believe, by the way, has a right to say. I'm not saying
[38:52.480 --> 38:56.760]  banning. And then they'll just kind of buy it. But people aren't buying it. They're like,
[38:56.760 --> 39:02.600]  right wing figure Lewis Farrakhan? So there's all these corrections. Oh, he's not a right
[39:02.600 --> 39:08.680]  wing figure. But it's all pre-packaged. One hour before all the stuff was taken down on
[39:08.680 --> 39:13.480]  Instagram and Facebook, it was already published early. They jumped the gun. And Oliver Darcy
[39:13.480 --> 39:25.480]  was coordinating the whole thing again. Organized, slander, libel and defamation. And then going
[39:25.480 --> 39:31.400]  all over CNN, all over Fox News, all over MSNBC, all over the place saying Jones was
[39:31.400 --> 39:37.960]  banned for anti-Semitism. I have a stack of news articles where they've got the media
[39:37.960 --> 39:48.200]  matters in the Washington Post and care that the Muslim group saying, yeah, Jones is anti-Semitic.
[39:48.200 --> 39:53.720]  Jones is anti-Semitic. And so we had to ban him. So they don't just ban you. They defame
[39:53.720 --> 39:58.760]  you and lie about you and then don't even care to show their stupid readers and viewers
[39:58.760 --> 40:04.520]  that they were lied to. So when we come back, I just went through how they premeditated
[40:04.520 --> 40:10.040]  this, how it's the smoking gun that it's political, that it wasn't done because I'm an anti-Semite.
[40:10.040 --> 40:14.040]  And again, once you say ban the anti-Semites, then it's everybody. That's what Mastercard's
[40:14.040 --> 40:18.840]  saying. Well, if you're going to right wing or anti-Semitic or anti-Muslim sites or if
[40:18.840 --> 40:22.600]  you're buying things we think are connected to white supremacists or anybody else we don't like,
[40:22.600 --> 40:28.520]  we're going to pull your bank account. That's right. They're saying they're going to
[40:28.520 --> 40:32.360]  surveil your purchases. They're already surveilling them, but now it's not for fraud.
[40:32.360 --> 40:39.080]  You bought the wrong magazine. These people are some crooks, man. They tried three years ago
[40:39.080 --> 40:43.400]  demonetizing people that criticized Hillary on YouTube. That didn't work, did it? So now they
[40:43.400 --> 40:47.240]  moved to banning people. And now they're saying we're in your phones. And now Oliver Darcy,
[40:47.240 --> 40:52.200]  when we come back, says we're going to control who you can text message on your phone. We're
[40:52.200 --> 40:58.600]  watching you, Americans. So you better shut up. I actually can't believe they've jumped the shark
[40:58.600 --> 41:02.920]  like this. I think America's going to reject this, but you know what? Trump hasn't done anything yet,
[41:02.920 --> 41:09.000]  so I'm really starting to get suspect to old Trumpy. I'm really starting to really get worried
[41:09.000 --> 41:13.960]  here at this point. And by suspect, I mean either he's got a blind spot or this is a triple game
[41:13.960 --> 41:20.680]  or something. But let me tell you, this is evil and this can't be allowed. Now, listen, I am,
[41:20.680 --> 41:24.600]  I've sued a few other people, PayPal and others. We were getting some lawsuits ready. I have to
[41:24.600 --> 41:29.240]  sue Facebook now and I have to sue some of the media and I already warned Business Insider and
[41:29.240 --> 41:33.480]  told them to retract and they didn't. So we are going to sue Business Insider and we are going to
[41:33.480 --> 41:40.360]  sue the writer personally. And we're going to get, we're also going to sue Facebook. We already
[41:40.360 --> 41:44.200]  have their internal documents submitting. They set me up. So they're in a lot of trouble. It's
[41:44.200 --> 41:49.560]  going to take a lot of money though. So listen, I sell high quality products, t-shirts, books,
[41:49.560 --> 41:54.200]  films, great supplements. I need everybody listening to just go to m4shore.com and try our
[41:54.200 --> 42:00.920]  great wake of America coffee. Try our fish oil. Try our turmeric bodies. Try our great X2, the
[42:00.920 --> 42:04.440]  cleanest iodine out there that's a missing link. If you're a new viewer or listener, you don't know
[42:04.440 --> 42:08.760]  about the iodine conspiracy. Learn about it. It's incredible. Changed my life. Changed too many others.
[42:08.760 --> 42:13.000]  It's a 98% review rate on power reviews. You get a free bottle of X3 with X2.
[42:14.920 --> 42:21.000]  Go there and spend money. I'm going to sue them. I'm not just going to fight news wise. I have to,
[42:21.000 --> 42:29.720]  man. They say I'm a hate leader and hate Jews when my children have Jewish background. I just
[42:29.720 --> 42:34.120]  cannot put up with this crap anymore. I just can't do it. And by the way, Zuckerberg, I'm coming to
[42:34.120 --> 42:38.360]  your house with helicopters, not over it, but near it. I'm going to bullhorn your ass. I'm coming
[42:38.360 --> 42:46.760]  after you. So you want the gloves off? Gloves are off you son of a bitch. You're a Nazi. You're
[42:46.760 --> 42:53.320]  just as bad as Hitler. And so I'm coming after you and I'm coming after all of you scumbags. But
[42:53.320 --> 42:59.880]  hey, flood me with money. You want to make me strong? Turn me into a giant. I've been doing a
[42:59.880 --> 43:07.400]  lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship. And I've noticed that there's one type of video
[43:07.960 --> 43:15.320]  that is the most censored, the most buried, the most suppressed. And that's the videos where you
[43:15.320 --> 43:22.040]  saw in 2016 election night, all the arrogant leftist authoritarians like the young turds and others
[43:22.040 --> 43:27.960]  get so butt hurt when Trump won. They don't want us to have that victory. They don't want us to
[43:27.960 --> 43:34.280]  remember what political action did. And that's why the globalist Hillary and others are trying to
[43:34.280 --> 43:40.200]  shut in for us now. This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech, about taking
[43:40.200 --> 43:46.200]  your very sovereignty away. This country is in a war. So again, I want to thank you for what you've
[43:46.200 --> 43:49.960]  done, but I want to remind you, if you don't spread the articles and videos, and if you don't
[43:49.960 --> 43:54.920]  financially get the great products we have and fund us in the 360 wind, we're dead in the water.
[43:54.920 --> 44:00.520]  I'm in your hands. You're in my hands. Infowarsstore.com. Thank you. Our grandparents, the great
[44:00.520 --> 44:04.280]  grandparents knew that they canned food during the fall. So they'd have it during the winter.

[45:00.120 --> 45:05.160]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of
[45:05.160 --> 45:10.280]  seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify
[45:10.280 --> 45:15.880]  the body. That's why I'm introducing ZShield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support. It's
[45:15.880 --> 45:21.560]  made in the USA. It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with
[45:21.560 --> 45:27.480]  detoxifying the body and it supports the infowar. It is a classical 360 win. This is the formula that
[45:27.480 --> 45:32.840]  I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection
[45:32.840 --> 45:37.240]  when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get. You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your
[45:37.240 --> 45:42.600]  family, and you owe it to the future of this country in the world that patriots stay as healthy and
[45:42.600 --> 45:49.000]  as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite
[45:49.000 --> 45:53.080]  those brush fires the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be. Thanks to your
[45:53.080 --> 45:57.400]  support and your prayers together we're changing the world. Now it's time to change our bodies
[45:57.400 --> 46:04.280]  with ZShield and infowarslife.com. I want to salute and commend every man woman and child
[46:04.280 --> 46:09.080]  that has supported this broadcast over the years and that has stood with us and I want to thank
[46:09.080 --> 46:13.480]  all of our sponsors and all of our affiliates and I'll tell you like it is. You've seen the
[46:13.480 --> 46:18.600]  unmitigated attack we've been under. You're our only sponsors and when you don't buy the products
[46:18.600 --> 46:25.240]  that are absolutely the best out there we aren't able to continue on. So remember you are the Info
[46:25.240 --> 46:30.280]  War. I'm not the leader, you are the leader. When you take action nothing stops you. We've got

[47:22.280 --> 47:26.120]  Of the Information War it's Alex Jones.
[47:34.360 --> 47:36.280]  I got a little bit hot there at the end of the segment.
[47:38.360 --> 47:42.280]  I don't know if Zuckerberg's actually calling the shots or pulling the punches or doing whatever
[47:42.280 --> 47:50.040]  he's doing there at Facebook but I tell you this I'm sick of them surveilling us manipulating our
[47:50.040 --> 47:55.480]  lives telling us what we can read and see and then they're all big 20-foot walls around their
[47:55.480 --> 48:01.240]  houses in huge Kauai areas they've taken from natives and just all their arrogance. There's
[48:01.240 --> 48:06.440]  going to be human action on the ground because it's the left and the global is trying to harass us
[48:06.440 --> 48:11.000]  on the street and make us uncomfortable. People like Zuckerberg are going to be made very very
[48:11.000 --> 48:18.840]  uncomfortable very very quickly because there is a thing called Newtonian physics and for every action
[48:18.840 --> 48:23.160]  there's an opposite and equal reaction and so I'll just say this to Zuckerberg and I've got a message
[48:23.160 --> 48:31.560]  for him later if this isn't you doing this then stop it and turn it around but if it doesn't get
[48:31.560 --> 48:34.920]  turned around I know damn well you and I'm getting my information from the show you've talked about
[48:34.920 --> 48:40.120]  it before then the gloves are off buddy you're not going to sit there and say I was taking off
[48:40.120 --> 48:46.120]  Facebook because I'm an anti-Semite and all these publications and then say that if anyone says my
[48:46.120 --> 48:53.480]  name they get in trouble without a fight politically economically and legally and again I've already
[48:53.480 --> 48:57.960]  talked to three top lawyers today doesn't matter how much money you have what you've done everybody's
[48:57.960 --> 49:07.080]  sick of you. The fact that you would have internal emails that I haven't done anything anti-Semitic
[49:07.960 --> 49:12.920]  a month ago and then there's a decision by managers not to ban the pages that were still there
[49:12.920 --> 49:17.880]  the media put out the lie that I'm supposed to be banned everywhere that's not true you took me down
[49:17.880 --> 49:22.280]  last year for fake reasons a few of the pages I didn't care about that fine it's a bunch of bull
[49:22.920 --> 49:29.480]  but now you're going to take me down because I'm a Nazi and then you're going to sit there and say
[49:29.480 --> 49:34.600]  that I'm the worst of the worst in your press release that's endangering me and my family and
[49:34.600 --> 49:41.880]  I'm tired of it I'm really sick of the left lying about everybody and being bullies and and you're
[49:41.880 --> 49:49.960]  just not going to get away with it but I'll tell listeners again we need to depose Facebook we need
[49:49.960 --> 49:53.720]  to have the court battles we need to be able to go through the motions we just have to go ahead and
[49:53.720 --> 50:00.920]  do it I have to say hey I have your internal proof you did this to me and you're not going to get
[50:00.920 --> 50:04.920]  away with internally saying Jones has done nothing wrong and then a month later banning me
[50:06.920 --> 50:11.000]  it's it's if you would have just banned me I'd say well there's censors this is what they're
[50:11.000 --> 50:18.600]  doing it needs to be stopped they're election meddling but when you do it on a mass scale
[50:19.240 --> 50:25.480]  it's not just me but others it's it's just it just has to stop and then you lie to Congress
[50:25.480 --> 50:30.920]  about it and then there's all the other news not just that you're caught removing me for
[50:30.920 --> 50:38.040]  political purposes and caught lying your own internal documents but that now you've got these
[50:38.040 --> 50:42.040]  human rights boards run by the Southern Private Law Center a criminal offshore group
[50:44.040 --> 50:48.040]  running around deciding who can have Facebook accounts who can't put everybody in Facebook
[50:48.040 --> 50:53.720]  jail and then you're sharing all the information when people like Oliver Darcy inside people's accounts
[50:55.560 --> 51:01.800]  and now you're setting up these group living rooms where it's other people that you go then and
[51:01.800 --> 51:08.520]  share all your stuff together with a much classic reeducation camp it's mind-blowing
[51:10.840 --> 51:16.200]  and it shows you what they're doing ahead of the 2020 election but it's a lot bigger than the 2020
[51:16.200 --> 51:22.200]  election isn't it it's about getting everybody used to being surveilled and being controlled
[51:23.800 --> 51:26.360]  and at the end of this piece on CNN yesterday
[51:26.360 --> 51:34.200]  where Oliver Darcy looks like some Winfield Gremlin out of a movie
[51:37.400 --> 51:43.000]  talking about strict action and then at the end he says oh and we need to see if Alex Jones
[51:43.560 --> 51:48.280]  that means getting to my internal phone he's finding out with Apple if
[51:48.280 --> 51:56.440]  and with Facebook all those other places if I've got WhatsApp because that's Facebook
[51:58.280 --> 52:03.880]  and I didn't but that's like signal or another dozen things where it's just a digital phone call
[52:03.880 --> 52:08.920]  or a text message they now want to get involved in your personal text messages and are surveilling
[52:08.920 --> 52:13.560]  what you're doing and he's on national news see that's the next phase the next phase is
[52:13.560 --> 52:20.520]  on your browser in your phone with news guard and that's a neocon run group and all this so you
[52:20.520 --> 52:26.120]  have the republican establishment the democrat establishment all moving for censorship fighting
[52:26.120 --> 52:30.520]  for control of this NSA technology that's been rolled out at the public in the name of Facebook
[52:30.520 --> 52:35.720]  Twitter and Google and we're really involved in private NSA interfaces that are really meant to
[52:35.720 --> 52:40.360]  surveil and control us and they're unveiling it all now and saying well it's because Alex Jones
[52:40.360 --> 52:47.160]  is an anti-semite we've got to do it don't say his name we're watching you in live time and we've
[52:47.160 --> 52:53.960]  got 20 000 minders at Facebook with AI watching you that is beyond black mirror episode that's
[52:53.960 --> 53:01.560]  beyond 1984 and they're doing it why not you accepted Amazon's Alexa in your house you accepted
[53:01.560 --> 53:05.320]  the surveillance cameras where they admit they're watching you what's the name of the Facebook system
[53:05.320 --> 53:10.760]  where it watches you in live time but it's got a little shutter you can close but it's still got a
[53:10.760 --> 53:20.040]  microphone and again you're like one of the hide it doesn't matter they want your data they manipulate
[53:20.040 --> 53:25.960]  the data against you here's an example came out 10 years ago if you have money and you buy first
[53:25.960 --> 53:31.560]  class or you or they know your wealthy when you go to these big travel sites and hotel sites they
[53:31.560 --> 53:37.320]  charge you more that's a cookie that knows your wealthy it rips you off that's an example of what
[53:37.320 --> 53:46.520]  this is doing to you so again the big question why isn't Trump doing anything it's because he's
[53:46.520 --> 53:51.080]  surrounded by neocons and lobbyists and he's speaking out against the censorship but it's the
[53:51.080 --> 53:55.480]  architecture of the system they keep saying it's a private company sir it's like a telecom or a
[53:55.480 --> 53:59.960]  highway saying certain groups can't drive down it they're openly discriminating against they're

[01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:15.480]  in times of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act i gave you a little bit
[01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:21.960]  too much truth and now i must be silenced banned by facebook banned by instagram and now the media
[01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:27.720]  says lewis farrakhan is far right what they obviously banned farrakhan at the same time to give them
[01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:33.080]  the excuse that this wasn't political it was totally political this is nothing less than
[01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:39.480]  election meddling everyone facebook has banned was instrumental in getting donald trump elected
[01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:45.720]  this is punishment this is a political purge this has nothing to do with hate or violating
[01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:51.400]  terms of service russians buy a few facebook ads leftists this is horrendous this is election
[01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:58.120]  meddling democracies at stake facebook bans most of the people who helps get trump elected leftists
[01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:03.800]  and boomers herderm a private company can do what it likes the creepiest thing is not the bans
[01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:08.920]  it's the threat that anyone else will be banned for talking about the people who were banned
[01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:13.800]  that's chilling that's giant corporations enforcing their own communist chinese style
[01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:20.840]  social credit system the leftists love it i was given no reason whatsoever for being banned by
[01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:26.920]  facebook or instagram so i'm dangerous someone who makes meme videos laughing at social justice
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:31.640]  warriors or is handing the power to decide who gets to have free speech to a handful of giant
[01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:37.960]  politically parties and corporations dangerous what's more dangerous they put me on a list with
[01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:44.440]  terrorists human traffickers and serial killers because i criticize modern art and modern architecture
[01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:50.280]  because i dare criticize mass immigration because i dare criticize a belief system yet you still
[01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:55.880]  host antifa accounts which threaten to assassinate the president you still host accounts belonging
[01:01:55.880 --> 01:02:03.240]  to the sicko who sent death threats to ben Shapiro's family this is truly truly clown world and notice
[01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:07.960]  how the media were tipped off over an hour in advance of me getting banned the same media that's
[01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:13.640]  been lobbying for conservatives to be silenced censored and de-platformed for the past two years
[01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:20.120]  there are barely any real journalists left they're all activists abusing their power working hand in
[01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:25.480]  hand with big tech to eliminate their competition when are we going to see any kind of sensible
[01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:31.080]  regulations or laws to stop this they're now removing people's ability to have bank accounts
[01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:35.720]  and credit cards because they have the wrong opinions they're literally trying to remove
[01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:42.920]  your right to buy and sell this is biblical no right to commerce unless you have the mark and
[01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:49.720]  what is the mark total intellectual castration and obedience so this looks like it's the end
[01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:56.120]  i'll still be at summit dot news while that exists while i exist as my entire purpose for existing
[01:02:56.120 --> 01:03:02.760]  is snuffed out while society is handed over to deranged infantilized cry babies who think hate
[01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:08.760]  speech is challenging their stupid opinions hysterical authoritarian clowns have seized
[01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:15.240]  control of the new public square and conservatives did nothing to stop it the trump administration
[01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:19.480]  did nothing to stop it you thought it would stop at alex jones you think it's going to stop at
[01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:25.960]  me you think it's going to stop at facebook accounts even demanded youtube remove ben Shapiro
[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:31.720]  they want your bank accounts they want your home they want you disappeared if freedom of
[01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:37.640]  speech is taken away then dumb and silent we may be led like sheep to the slaughter
[01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:49.400]  all right folks i've blown off some steam in the first hour constitutional lawyer very successful
[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:53.880]  litigator civil rights lawyer robert barges happens to be in town while this all this is
[01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:58.680]  happening he predicted a month ago on air they were about to set me up for any cynicism it happened
[01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:04.120]  we issued a legal warning to these groups they just want to have a live but remember this isn't
[01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:09.400]  about me i'm not here talking about how i'm being censored they're coming after everybody right now
[01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:14.920]  this is a major rollout and they've told us the next architecture the president tweeted about this
[01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:20.200]  they're going to control the links you can send out and in live time they've got watchers through
[01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:25.960]  these apps on your phone watching what you're doing in text messages and phone calls when we come
[01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:31.560]  back cnn's oliver darcy says that's next and then they're trying to stop me from sending text messages
[01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:37.000]  now exactly i mean you see it with what's up you see it's just broad-scale wholesale censorship
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.840]  suppression of speech it's an attempt to you know say hey everybody create a group living room on
[01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:45.320]  your facebook page and once you do uh we're going to decide what you can talk about yeah once you do
[01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:48.680]  we're going to tie you up and rape you oh it's not me effectively i mean in prevent you hold it right
[01:04:48.680 --> 01:05:03.080]  back stay with us i want to say brain force is great i want to say turbo force is amazing it is
[01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:09.400]  but if you took it with fish oil it's like the fish oil is it the fish oil's better than it and
[01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:15.880]  that's an example of what i'm talking about fish oil is liquid energy brain body heart the cleanest
[01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:20.440]  the best out there you've got the children's you've got the adults you've got the krill oil if you're
[01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:23.960]  going to get the full effect the fish oil and the children's are really strong they don't give you
[01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:28.680]  the burpees but krill oils is the best and it'll give you the damn burps and i'm sorry you want
[01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:33.240]  something like this you don't get stuff for free the krill is hallucinogenic it's so good it in my
[01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:37.240]  view i'm not a medical statement here but let me tell you something i eat five camp loads of
[01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:45.480]  krill oil before i go to bed i'm seeing santa claus that night so your brain is made basically out
[01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:52.600]  of what this oil is so we don't make a big profit off of it but you notice i just obsess because
[01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:56.280]  whatever the best is we've got i just can't lie to you i just can't do it
[01:05:56.280 --> 01:06:17.160]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:23.480]  there are thousands of channels out there millions of people on the internet talking but folks this
[01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:29.160]  is the most banned most demonized most lied about broadcast the world facebook when they banned farrakhan
[01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:35.000]  to try to cover up they were banning conservatives they just threw him in said i'm the most banned person
[01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:42.280]  and a new special clash of hate leader and that you're not allowed to say my name or my website
[01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:46.680]  info wars dot com i'm going to read the press release unless this is being sent out to tv stations
[01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:52.920]  this is our stations are getting these they're sending them out to everybody telling them you
[01:06:52.920 --> 01:07:00.120]  don't have them on and you will we'll take this away from you this is racketeering this is torches
[01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:06.360]  interference this is the this is trump has green lighted them doing this by his his his lack of
[01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:12.120]  resisting and so is congress and so now we see the damn breaking and we're going to play a clip
[01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:15.720]  in a moment i've been mentioning for an hour and robert barnes constitutional lawyers are with us
[01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:23.400]  where this app what's app that been bought up by facebook they're buying thousands of companies
[01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:29.560]  here thousands hundreds of big ones that's some popular thing for text messages and phone calls
[01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:34.280]  just individuals kind of like signal and i still use regular phones even though they don't seem to
[01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:37.800]  work good i don't know why these apps work so well because they're digital because the phone
[01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:43.720]  company can't do that but it's nsa level technology now they're saying we're going to watch what you're
[01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:48.200]  doing and who you're calling and then mastercard said we're not just going to ban extremist bank
[01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:54.680]  accounts or having shopping carts or people to criticize radical islam or open borders we're
[01:07:54.680 --> 01:08:00.680]  going to watch who you visit and who you're supporting and if you buy something from someone we
[01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:07.640]  don't like your band that's in the newscast that's mainstream news i mean this is mark of the beast
[01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:15.880]  on pc p steroids and nitrous oxide i mean this is this is this is this is this is leaping faster
[01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:20.040]  than i thought and people always said facebook's the most evil and i'm like well really i kind of
[01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:26.600]  think google is no no they've proven that this is the next level and and it's just insane we're
[01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:31.000]  going to play these clips but i mean i don't know what the bigger deal is you were here a month ago
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:35.320]  the admission uh that that i didn't do anything anti-semitic even if i did i should have free speech
[01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:39.640]  they found me not guilty of it but a month later still go with the story and ban me coordinated
[01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:45.000]  with business insider and a bunch of others who all published at the same time or them saying yeah
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:49.640]  we're going to be in your text messages and listen to your phone calls now with ai the that really
[01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:54.600]  the big announcement is the ai's gone live they had a congressional hearing last year where the
[01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:58.520]  the islamic guy had run over people in new york screaming all by with a truck paul wrote that an

[01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:23.000]  we'll have ai in control in a few months it's here and they've announced it's here but see ai can't
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:31.000]  control memes or satire or comedy so everyone's saying oh we we deplore alex jones he's horrible
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:35.480]  you can only say his name if you say he's a horrible person so now everybody's saying he's a real

[01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:14.120]  of crystallizing it what's the biggest story the ai's turned on they're watching everything you do
[01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:18.120]  now they're telling people with me as a test case don't share his name it'll be something new next
[01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:23.640]  week uh or then admitting it's all political or that trump's not doing anything i think the biggest
[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:28.120]  thing is that they've now jumped the shark in terms of they're no longer saying here's who can be on
[01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:33.080]  the social media here's who can use social media here's who can use paypal who here's who can use
[01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:38.280]  payment processors they're now saying here's who you the ordinary person out there can talk about
[01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:43.240]  here's whose names you can reference here's whose people you here's what links you can share but
[01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:46.920]  he goes beyond it you can literally cannot say the name elix jones now you cannot say the name
[01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:51.320]  info wars are you're subject to censorship subject to suppression subject to being banned and this
[01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:57.000]  happens literally two days after zuckerberg says hey i want everybody to use facebook to become
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:02.520]  your everyday living room to let use facebook to discuss whatever you want in your private chat groups
[01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:06.360]  in your living rooms and what is he doing today he's getting rid of all living rooms and private
[01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:10.680]  chat groups that mention the words elix jones or info wars he's saying in that room is a soviet
[01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:15.800]  agent one of the machine gun who takes you to gulag and you just say a name uh precisely i mean
[01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:22.120]  it's very much it's come on in i'm not elix jones's filth good i like elix jones take on to the gulag
[01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:26.440]  exactly and clearly for example here he was at the same time saying he's going to promote privacy
[01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:30.520]  again after he's been caught violating privacy rules repeatedly again and again and again he
[01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:34.280]  surveils everyone exactly now it's obvious that's what he's doing here how does he know whether
[01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:38.920]  someone is talking about info wars are alex jones in these private chat rooms unless he's
[01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:45.080]  monitoring him oh they say they say right here in the press release you can only talk about him
[01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:50.200]  have you explicitly condemn him exactly i mean it's insane that that's like a twilight zone
[01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:55.240]  episode even past that there there's not a twilight zone episode an orwellian book and an actual
[01:11:55.240 --> 01:11:59.320]  historical example of this really ever happening other than the closest you would get is the man
[01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:03.720]  in the iron mask story that that's the most analogous through any part of fictional history
[01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:06.920]  or folks that don't know that his classical literature has gone the way of the goonie bird
[01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:10.360]  talking about it sure so what happened was there was someone who was the actual king
[01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:15.320]  and they were locked up in uh in a prison and they were put in an iron mask so that even other jail
[01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:19.640]  other people in the jail jailers other people who visited the jail wouldn't know who he was that
[01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:24.200]  the real king had been locked up uh because if they recognized them and saw him they would
[01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:28.360]  realize that there was a fake king a pretender king who had the crown precisely and so that's
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:32.680]  the same dynamic here so here i mean that that's the closest example but otherwise we've never
[01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:37.080]  had anything like this even orwell didn't predict this i mean the of all the people who fork even
[01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:41.960]  scott adams didn't forecast this so some of the best predictors in the world some of the most
[01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:46.280]  aggressive science fiction writers some of the most uh the most out as uh uh you know huxley
[01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:50.760]  didn't predict this nobody even nobody even got to the point where they said you know in the future
[01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:55.160]  there's going to be a point in place in time where in your own living room the facebook living room
[01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:59.480]  you can't mention someone's name and they're surveilling you and you take little robots into
[01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:04.840]  your house what's the name of facebook's i know uh there's google assist uh there's alexa with with
[01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:11.160]  amazon what's the name portal and it's a portal with cameras little robot like me watching you
[01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:16.360]  they remote control it they said there's like 200 000 people just from facebook that are contracted
[01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:20.920]  to watch it and see what you're doing and they're all it's like what the and now they're going to
[01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:26.440]  tell you what to say next it'll be don't say alex jones in your own bedroom well absolutely that's
[01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:29.720]  where it's going it it's it's already there digitally they're saying in your own digital
[01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:34.280]  personal private space that you carve off for your personal private space that they ask you to carve
[01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:38.280]  off as your personal private space they're going to monitor it surveil it he says let us into your
[01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:44.040]  living room absolutely man be uh let us be your living room let us let us create a digital living
[01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:47.400]  room that substitutes for your real living room but just in case you don't do that we're going to
[01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:52.760]  put a little device in there to monitor what you are saying and it's we're living in science fiction
[01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:58.440]  and this is the dystopia and it's a dystopia beyond even the wildest imagination how did they choose
[01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:02.360]  us though because obviously i was the target a month ago we got the secret documents uh that are
[01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:06.280]  now public and then they just threw ferrican in but i mean this is crazy it's the highest level of
[01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:11.000]  success so for so they were trying to go at you and trying to attack you by trying to find some
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:14.920]  term of service that you had violated they couldn't every time they tried they couldn't i mean even
[01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:19.800]  like the years ago the anti-defamation league which is not exactly a politically neutral organization
[01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:23.080]  looked at all the allegations of anti-semitism against you and said they're false that said in
[01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:28.040]  fact that alex jones is not anti-semitic at all and that's a edl and that's a far left organization
[01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:33.400]  that doesn't have any problem all you know over accusing people of being anti-semitic so they
[01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:36.840]  couldn't go there they looked at the post they realized the post didn't violate any rules because
[01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:40.600]  their own people looking at it said this didn't violate any rules so they were in a place where
[01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:44.040]  they're like okay we've just got to create our own orwellian world and we got to go further than
[01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:48.760]  orwell even imagine going and we got to just ban not only him but ban anyone ever talking about him
[01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:53.080]  referring to him referencing him sharing his content or just saying his name you literally
[01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:57.880]  create the voldemort harry potter fiction and make it a literal legal political and that's what a
[01:14:57.880 --> 01:15:02.760]  wired magazine said three months ago they said no one should be able to say his name and then we
[01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:06.840]  should put that up on screen and people thought it was a joke oh absolutely i mean when i first
[01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:10.040]  heard about it i thought that's just too insane that's too insane even for big tech they're not
[01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:13.720]  going to do something that tells everybody it's something that's so obvious because if i was
[01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:18.520]  somebody and i didn't even know alex jones or info wars i would immediately be curious if i well
[01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:23.320]  yeah what is it about enforcers i'm not that is it guests like you because i think it's a combination
[01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:27.880]  i it's it's the success rate at getting attention of independent ideas outside well they know we
[01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:32.600]  kicked their ass yeah exactly we just keep firing proton torpedoes down the reactor shaft and there's
[01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:36.600]  blown up like 15 desktops precisely and they're seeing it translate to people's everyday activity
[01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:41.400]  they're seeing it translate to political success from us to brazil to hungary it's changing the
[01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:46.280]  world because of what ordinary everyday people are doing precisely ladies and gentlemen we're
[01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:51.560]  broadcasting worldwide i gotta say i feel good that's come like this attacking us because i believe

[01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:30.680]  people that people are calling like how are you handling this and i'm like i'm worried about the
[01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:34.520]  country in the world but me particularly it's like i'm in a twilight zone episode
[01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:42.520]  barbara barnes uh you have just won a huge case in owaki highly respected uh tax lawyer
[01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:47.160]  highly respected civil rights lawyer i mean i mean you're up there as a super lawyer nobody
[01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:52.360]  denies it and of course then they're they're trying to keep you out of the case in canada
[01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:56.600]  kid they're trying to keep you out of the case in austin and all because you said these suits
[01:20:56.600 --> 01:21:01.320]  are politically motivated they try to have a hearing yesterday the judge pushed it off
[01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:06.840]  and it's the number one story uh trending on on a major leftist disinfo site to get rid of you so
[01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:10.280]  they don't want to just ban me from the internet or say people can't defend me on the internet of
[01:21:10.280 --> 01:21:15.960]  their band openly admitting censorship it's political but but but now they don't want you to be my
[01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:21.960]  lawyer i mean it they just they're just out of control oh completely i mean it's one thing to
[01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:25.960]  try to suppress your speech it's another thing to try to suppress the speech of ordinary people
[01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:29.880]  all across the country but it's really extraordinary to try to suppress the speech of the lawyer
[01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:35.000]  advocating uh on your on a client's behalf while the other side lawyers run around like chickens
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:38.600]  with their heads cut off all over television slandering me well i mean the case started out
[01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:43.000]  with the the lawyer being on nbc and reaching tens of millions of people megan kelly exactly
[01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:46.760]  well leaking all kinds of story leaking the deposition putting creating a youtube page and
[01:21:46.760 --> 01:21:51.560]  then all leaders raise a shield in defense on our own show and it's like don't you raise a shield
[01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:57.160]  correct exactly if and not only that it's clear that people are politically misusing and abusing
[01:21:57.160 --> 01:22:01.880]  this the suit senator murphy's comments have no business in the in this country period to say he
[01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:06.760]  wants to have someone banned from being able to speak ever anywhere anyplace anytime which is what
[01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:11.720]  he did based on his misusing and abusing that lawsuit to do so so the i'm entitled to my first
[01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:14.840]  amendment rights i'm going to continue to express my first amendment rights they're not going to
[01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:18.360]  stop me from doing that they're going to have to put me six feet under before that happens
[01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:22.280]  so the uh so to waste that time for the most part but it shows the degree of insanity that's
[01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:26.520]  taking place here they don't want anyone to be able to talk about you reference you defend you
[01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:30.200]  even a lawyer whose constitutional duty and obligation is to do precisely that
[01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:35.000]  and it shows the scope of it i mean and it's ironic that all of this is happening like when
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:39.400]  you look at what zuckerberg said just two days before he decided by the way nobody can talk about
[01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:44.360]  alec stones he said the future is private and don't worry we're going to create digital families
[01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:49.240]  digital private spaces digital living rooms for you to talk about in private chat rooms whatever
[01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:53.160]  you want to talk about and then two days later says by the way we're actually monitoring this on a
[01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:58.600]  real-time basis with out with a uh with algorithms and artificial intelligence and we're going to
[01:22:58.600 --> 01:23:03.400]  actually suppress and censor anything you say in your actual room i mean even the soviets didn't
[01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:09.160]  do this right this is beyond the stasi and like you said they have like the future is private
[01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:14.360]  it's like come into us have your living room with me bring a little robot in that watches you
[01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:19.960]  it's all private say whatever you want by the way don't say alex jones or don't visit his site
[01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:24.680]  or you'll be banned i mean like who would let creepy weirdos like this in oh completely tricked
[01:23:24.680 --> 01:23:30.280]  everybody in so now we want contact they've got our photos and my wife two years ago tried to
[01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:34.760]  delete her facebook tried to get rid of it won't go away and then it sends her messages oh here's a
[01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:39.800]  memory of you five years ago yes exactly because well there's my old ex-boyfriend seven years ago
[01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:43.880]  well not only that but here i'm in a swimsuit in cancun day at nine years ago and here i'm with
[01:23:43.880 --> 01:23:48.840]  my mom ten years ago and it's just like it's stolen her identity precisely and it won't go away
[01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:53.080]  exactly it's one of the reasons why they have such strong opposition to things like alternative
[01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:57.880]  methods of currency things like blockchain because those could allow ordinary individuals to reassert
[01:23:57.880 --> 01:24:01.320]  ownership over their own identity because they would own those little pieces of themselves
[01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:04.920]  in social no i agree i never got into blockchain and all that because i knew it'd be a pump and dump
[01:24:04.920 --> 01:24:09.640]  but i believe the technology itself now you should advise me the cleanest best systems we should get
[01:24:09.640 --> 01:24:13.320]  into this immediately absolutely because i think i think there's a wide range of systems out there
[01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:17.480]  that are useful that people need to fully pursue what they're doing is forcing people to use alternative
[01:24:17.480 --> 01:24:22.040]  systems alternative mechanisms alternative ways of communicating because the mechanisms that they
[01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:26.120]  have monopolistic control over they're going to use this and of course they would abuse it but
[01:24:26.120 --> 01:24:31.880]  imagine maubel had like 90 percent of telephones in 1973 or whatever they broke up a few years later
[01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:35.560]  and it was a monopoly but imagine the phone company when you were saying something they didn't like
[01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:41.480]  broke in and said don't say that people would riot or instead they're breaking in saying don't do this
[01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:45.240]  exactly or remove your ability to use your phone to talk to your to talk to anybody because you
[01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:49.240]  talked about an impermissible topic or you're referenced an impermissible person or you're
[01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:52.280]  referenced an impermissible news site and of course you know what's going to happen they get
[01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:56.600]  weak-minded mentally old people to be the sjw is the interface with us there's 70 000 of them
[01:24:56.600 --> 01:25:00.680]  admittedly trained by the Southern Poverty Law Center they have a background they're a leftist
[01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:04.120]  they're a failed professor they're not getting a job they're a failed media person they give them
[01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:09.720]  an interface they give them directives they go out and help the ai censor 70 000 total 20 000
[01:25:09.720 --> 01:25:15.240]  facebook they're ramping it up and then these people are given access to your accounts your
[01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:20.440]  photos they're in your life writing reports on you they're watching you jerk off man they're
[01:25:20.440 --> 01:25:24.760]  watching you have sex with your wife they're dialed into the alexa they're dialed into the
[01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:31.800]  portal this is admitted and and and you understand the cultural jump this is of ai learning using
[01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:38.360]  human traders as its collaborators big tech traders with ai with a bunch of collaborators
[01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:42.440]  literally watching you cook that ham watching you take a dump while you're on your phone
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:48.200]  looking at photos of your kids indexing and all this is like an alien invasion but it's big tech
[01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:53.960]  and a bunch of silicon valley psychopaths precisely and what in for to be so blatant and to be so
[01:25:53.960 --> 01:25:58.040]  bold i think is what shocked people yesterday to go out there and say hey by the way we're banning
[01:25:58.040 --> 01:26:01.560]  these people simply because we think they're dangerous not because they violated any terms
[01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:06.680]  of service not because they violated any contractual terms not because they did anything wrong at all
[01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:12.600]  but simply because we think their ideas and their speech is scary for people to hear and listen to
[01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:19.720]  because oh my god think of the elitism of that to say oh come in your digital bedroom or living
[01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:25.400]  room you have all your speech and then they totally do a 180 and then they go but we know best
[01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:31.240]  we're all the college professors that are in your life now we're watching you and news guard
[01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:36.600]  announced six months ago they're going to be at browser level in your phone if you have a microsoft
[01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:45.000]  phone this is so criminal this is like but it's like too criminal to fail it's so big so organized
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:51.080]  so insane and our instinct like goonie birds as americans is this can't happen but it did happen
[01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:55.320]  it is happening precisely it's stuff that even the people on the on the head who had the most
[01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:59.800]  fantastical fictional view of what could happen thought could not happen they're like okay i mean
[01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:03.480]  i mean nobody was saying okay what's gonna happen a year ago two years ago five years ago
[01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:07.960]  20 50 years ago nobody was saying you're gonna have a time in place where there's certain people's
[01:27:07.960 --> 01:27:12.360]  names who you cannot talk about certain networks who you cannot reference by name i mean they're
[01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:17.240]  not just you can't reference their content camera can't link them can't talk about them can't mention
[01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:22.680]  them or you'll be said this is like i i i never thought stuff was a simulation but this is getting
[01:27:22.680 --> 01:27:27.960]  like yeah this is not real it's a very bad simulation and everybody knows i'm like pro israel
[01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:31.640]  i'm not vehemently pro israelis who's got its own problems like i'm pro america america is not
[01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:35.880]  perfect but you know it's better than it's like you know israel is better than the countries around it
[01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:40.680]  but i'm not against people because they're jewish to say i'm an amy semi in thousands of articles
[01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:46.280]  it's just it shows they have no bottom the system will do anything and they're and they're basically
[01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:50.360]  they're testing out what they can get away with can't if they can completely remove any positive
[01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:54.680]  content any positive reference by any ordinary person any member of the media any bad member of
[01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:58.920]  the press they're getting rid of their competition absolutely they are they can also defame and libel
[01:27:58.920 --> 01:28:03.480]  them without consequence because there's nobody to and people don't get that they go so what let
[01:28:03.480 --> 01:28:08.600]  them censor you know that's where 90% of the communications going on and then they can say
[01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:13.080]  whatever they want but i can't even have my name unless it's negative oh exactly i think somebody
[01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:17.800]  put a good put it well yesterday they're like okay then with if the uh if the explanation is hey don't
[01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:21.640]  worry you can just go and create your own system your own social media your well now you have to
[01:28:21.640 --> 01:28:25.320]  create your own social media your own banking system your own government effectively your own
[01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:29.400]  economic system your own phone system and they're fighting to take all that away from us precisely
[01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:33.080]  and they already have the de facto monopolies and then market space that's not a practical
[01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:37.720]  opportunity only the power of ordinary people exercising the rights of individual conscience
[01:28:37.720 --> 01:28:42.440]  that they are born with and given by god are the only way to resist this system effectively precisely
[01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:53.720]  you see the precisely oh my god i just think god i'm not zuckerberg or these other

[01:33:52.120 --> 01:33:57.480]  out there we don't give in we don't back down we keep dominating one big reason they ended up
[01:33:57.480 --> 01:34:02.040]  banning his facebook said no a month ago i guess zuckerberg just kind of gave up i don't even really
[01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:04.680]  blame him at the end of the day the moment we think about it i got mad at him earlier but
[01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:09.560]  that's just bad at the general system he just said fine regulate it take all the speech away he
[01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:13.560]  he just kind of gave in knowing they'd go too far i think there's some of that going on here but
[01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:20.120]  but this is like the ring of mordor it's just too dangerous to use well censorship is just so out
[01:34:20.120 --> 01:34:26.360]  of control but i'm gonna say this right now we have great products at info wars store.com
[01:34:27.480 --> 01:34:34.920]  and we have great information and the listeners are awesome but yeah them cutting us out not
[01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:39.640]  letting us have advertising not letting us advertise not letting us do so many things
[01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:45.080]  taking our bank accounts away where we had to get higher rate banks to even process orders
[01:34:45.080 --> 01:34:49.640]  it's been rough but i had a lot of expansion i wanted to do that we weren't able to do because
[01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:55.640]  the attacks and i really think america instinctively in the world should double down and just say you
[01:34:55.640 --> 01:34:59.960]  know we're gonna back alex jones my god they're banning his name and saying you're only allowed
[01:34:59.960 --> 01:35:06.120]  to talk about him if it's negative can you imagine that and i'm not a victim we're obviously doing
[01:35:06.120 --> 01:35:14.120]  things here on air that scare the living bejesus out of the enemy and so whether you share the

[01:36:41.160 --> 01:36:45.160]  that i tend to say a special is over and then it's not over and i don't throw fits anymore
[01:36:45.160 --> 01:36:49.560]  because i just kind of shout orders the marketing's like one minute meetings you know twice a week
[01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:53.400]  or like do this do that and this and then they're like well sure we're about to show out of

[01:37:00.120 --> 01:37:06.520]  probably want to end this free bottle of um knockout you've got the great sleep bay with it and i
[01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:13.240]  said yeah yeah in that they didn't end it and so why not we'll just sell out we'll just run that uh till

[01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:23.800]  get you down it's the best stuff out there uh info or store dot com info was live dot com or triple
[01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:27.560]  eight two five three three one three nine but whatever you do go read the reviews of the actual
[01:37:27.560 --> 01:37:31.560]  products because when you have combos those are brand new deals that just run a week usually so
[01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:35.560]  there's really not ever reviews of that but just go look at the reviews of x2 look at the reviews
[01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:41.720]  of x3 look at the reviews of knockout and check that out there's a constitutional right to use
[01:37:41.720 --> 01:37:49.720]  social media says supreme court this is a big ruling uh that came out a few months ago and
[01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:54.920]  there was another one before that 2008 north carolina law barring registered sex offenders from
[01:37:54.920 --> 01:38:00.360]  accessing commercial social media sites was overturned this year shang it because it amounts to
[01:38:00.360 --> 01:38:05.400]  public square uh so we we have supreme court rulings don't we well basically the original
[01:38:05.400 --> 01:38:10.760]  supreme court u.s supreme court logic was that if a company took over the public square and became a
[01:38:10.760 --> 01:38:15.560]  company town then that they were obligated to abide by the same first amendment restrictions as any
[01:38:15.560 --> 01:38:19.800]  governmental entity would be and so that was originally established by the supreme court
[01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:24.200]  almost a hundred years ago then what happened is that the california supreme court went further
[01:38:24.200 --> 01:38:28.200]  and said that applies to shopping malls so if you're in the context of shopping malls you have to
[01:38:28.200 --> 01:38:33.080]  go forward and you have to produce that information and intel but in fact what would happen is that
[01:38:33.080 --> 01:38:37.960]  the uh the u.s supreme court did not extend it ultimately to shopping malls and so went from
[01:38:37.960 --> 01:38:42.920]  what what happened after that is that the u.s supreme court while it keeps saying in various
[01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:47.960]  formats that there's constitutional protection for the public's for the private ownership of
[01:38:47.960 --> 01:38:52.520]  the public square they have yet to enforce it against any of the private companies themselves
[01:38:52.520 --> 01:38:56.600]  and that's the big question is when will that happen because right now if we don't move forward
[01:38:56.600 --> 01:39:00.280]  if we don't go forward we don't do something significant and substantial that what's going
[01:39:00.280 --> 01:39:04.520]  to happen is that the private monopolies that own the public square are going to be able to
[01:39:04.520 --> 01:39:10.520]  control censor surveil and and suppress speech how in any manner they want which is what currently
[01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:15.480]  is taking place in transpiring so the only way to defeat that and to overturn that is to say
[01:39:15.480 --> 01:39:21.800]  if you choose to have section 230 immunity if you choose to be a public monopoly or effectively is
[01:39:21.800 --> 01:39:25.400]  what they are then you should be obligated to abide by the same first amendment limits and
[01:39:25.400 --> 01:39:30.200]  restrictions as everyone else as any other governmental entity would be so for example
[01:39:30.200 --> 01:39:35.880]  that's how it was because people had a constitutional right to engage president trump on twitter that
[01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:40.200]  president trump is not allowed to black people on twitter now apparently some democratic congressmen
[01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:43.400]  haven't got this message so they're going to be subject to suit about it but that's what that
[01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:48.680]  was the legal premise for it so given that that same legal premise should apply unfortunately the
[01:39:48.680 --> 01:39:54.600]  courts have yet to apply it to the big tech companies to the big tech oligopolies so the
[01:39:54.600 --> 01:40:02.040]  so facebook and twitter and google and youtube have been able to avoid and evade these first
[01:40:02.040 --> 01:40:06.760]  amendment restrictions because the supreme court has yet to extend the common sense doctor and
[01:40:06.760 --> 01:40:11.640]  they originally imposed on private ownership of the public square to the modern equivalent of
[01:40:11.640 --> 01:40:16.840]  private wasn't mad dredge a trailblazer for 10 years he warned get out of these ghettos we need
[01:40:16.840 --> 01:40:20.920]  to surf the web we need home pages we need individuals many groups we don't need these big
[01:40:20.920 --> 01:40:25.000]  megacorporations they're going to take advantage of you they're going to abuse you they're going to
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:30.040]  put you in ghettos they've done it now he's been proven prophetic absolutely you everything he was
[01:40:30.040 --> 01:40:34.600]  predicting on that side of the scale was completely true and originally what was anticipated and he
[01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:38.600]  was right about this was that if hillary had won they were going to institutionalize these things
[01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:42.120]  through the fcc but even though trump won they're just still going ahead with it they are i mean
[01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:47.400]  what is is trump delayed their ability to do so but also motivated them to do so so when it kept
[01:40:47.400 --> 01:40:51.960]  expanding when elections in hungary and in elections in brazil kept reinforcing it that's why
[01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:56.520]  they're obsessed now with whatsapp it's because whatsapp was effectively used to circumvent big
[01:40:56.520 --> 01:41:02.120]  media censorship and surveillance of the brazilian election we've got lora lumar coming up we got her
[01:41:02.120 --> 01:41:06.200]  on i haven't played this clip yet this is really have two minutes to break you guys go to the end
[01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:09.960]  of the oliver darson clip from yesterday i'll play the whole thing coming up but just the last
[01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:15.320]  30 seconds or so where he goes and now we're seeing him jones is on whatsapp that's a text message
[01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:20.280]  phone call system so they're saying well it's new and it's digital and facebook owns it so it can
[01:41:20.280 --> 01:41:24.760]  watch what you're doing when you download the app they give you ads and now we're going to watch what
[01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:29.880]  you're saying dude i mean this is criminal the nsa can go to jail for that knowing that you look at
[01:41:29.880 --> 01:41:33.640]  facebook's messenger app facebook's messenger app was designed to be able to tap into your phone
[01:41:33.640 --> 01:41:38.280]  contacts tap into your text messages tap into your private and that's what they're doing here's that
[01:41:38.280 --> 01:41:42.280]  clip we'll come back with lora lumar another political president of freelumer.com here here he
[01:41:42.280 --> 01:41:47.560]  is saying get rid of your right to text message here it is yes facebook obviously owns instagram
[01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:52.360]  and so someone like alex jones had been banned from facebook a while back last year in the summer
[01:41:52.360 --> 01:41:56.840]  but he was still having a presence on instagram and they had drawn a lot of scrutiny from people
[01:41:56.840 --> 01:42:00.760]  who are saying hey you know you guys banned him from one of your platforms why are you allowing
[01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:06.760]  him to have a presence on instagram and so yes now facebook is going to be banning alex jones and
[01:42:06.760 --> 01:42:11.560]  info wars from not only their main platform facebook but also from instagram i checked in
[01:42:11.560 --> 01:42:16.200]  also to see if these people would be banned from whatsapp which is also owned by facebook um and
[01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:21.640]  a spokesperson cannot say immediately because it's i guess unclear whether some of these people have
[01:42:21.640 --> 01:42:25.480]  whatsapp accounts according to the spokesperson so now they want to get rid of us individually
[01:42:25.480 --> 01:42:31.080]  having text message accounts okay and info so so you can call your mommy and again notice they use
[01:42:31.080 --> 01:42:35.480]  this thing oh he was banned yeah fake reasons to take down some accounts last year so now that's
[01:42:35.480 --> 01:42:39.320]  the president will take him off everything will put him in a gulag will put him in a prison will
[01:42:39.320 --> 01:42:44.360]  take away his phones i mean take away his tech don't let him write letters out of the prison god
[01:42:44.360 --> 01:42:50.680]  what's what do we want these americans do next call their children on the phone god almighty cnn

[01:47:01.160 --> 01:47:15.000]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:22.840]  you walk into this room
[01:47:25.400 --> 01:47:31.560]  you know laura lumbers with us the next few segments we've got robert barnes constitutional
[01:47:31.560 --> 01:47:39.880]  lawyer right right in shotgun of us if you just tuned in cnn is now trying to get into the accounts
[01:47:39.880 --> 01:47:47.160]  of laura lumar alex jones and others to see if we have apps that allow us to text people
[01:47:48.200 --> 01:47:55.160]  whatsapp and the bet's private phone calls and they admit in their own review of me a month ago
[01:47:55.160 --> 01:47:59.080]  that i didn't say any specific stuff by the way if i did people have a right to say that that's the
[01:47:59.080 --> 01:48:03.080]  open marketplace if i did but that everybody knows that's not true but what about laura lumars she's
[01:48:03.080 --> 01:48:08.840]  jewish she's pro israel she goes to israel um she's been called a white supremacist i remember
[01:48:08.840 --> 01:48:12.920]  when she was in congress yelling about censorship last year they said oh the white supremacist laura
[01:48:12.920 --> 01:48:19.080]  lumar the defamation is cuckoo land we go oh well they're the mainstream media they don't no one
[01:48:19.080 --> 01:48:23.800]  believes them it doesn't matter they say it it becomes reality and here's their internal documents
[01:48:23.800 --> 01:48:28.600]  mr barnes we go to lumar saying we know these people aren't these things they still ban us
[01:48:28.600 --> 01:48:33.000]  that's a big deal we have that because this is for political purposes oh no question i mean so
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:36.600]  their own internal protocols their own internal procedures their own internal people looked at
[01:48:36.600 --> 01:48:41.880]  this investigated it and determined there was no basis to find any violation of the terms of service
[01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:46.600]  and then they put out there hey by the way if a bunch of people comment on someone's instagram
[01:48:46.600 --> 01:48:51.000]  to a certain number then maybe we can use that to ban it well that was unsuccessful too because
[01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:55.320]  there were too many positive followers it's only four percent isimetic exactly that they wanted
[01:48:55.320 --> 01:48:59.240]  more but they couldn't get more in those even when they had the troll farms on the left trying to
[01:48:59.240 --> 01:49:03.400]  barrage people to try to create a fake story that didn't otherwise exist they were not successful
[01:49:03.400 --> 01:49:07.560]  because there were too many good followers and positive followers who were like this is this
[01:49:07.560 --> 01:49:11.240]  who supported it it's incredible we're gonna get where you think this is going but laura lumar
[01:49:11.240 --> 01:49:15.800]  what do you think they're doing here obviously you're effective you're out exposing the attack
[01:49:15.800 --> 01:49:19.640]  on free speech what is trump doing i mean you've obviously got a lot of points you're one of the
[01:49:20.600 --> 01:49:25.480]  four people banned obviously we're all nationalistic conservatives or they they i think they threw
[01:49:25.480 --> 01:49:30.120]  ferrican in just to make it might look political but what's your take on this laura lumar fellow
[01:49:30.120 --> 01:49:34.600]  thought criminal you're in a very elite group now they said i'm the most banned though you're not
[01:49:34.600 --> 01:49:40.840]  allowed to say my name or enforce unless it's negative so laura you're you're not as powerful
[01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:46.760]  as me yet you're working your way up there though yeah thanks for having me on alex well
[01:49:46.760 --> 01:49:50.600]  they're just trying to kill us you want to know what they're trying to do they want us dead that's
[01:49:50.600 --> 01:49:57.240]  why yesterday facebook literally designated me and you and mylo and paul joce of watson and others as
[01:49:57.240 --> 01:50:02.680]  as designated terrorists uh if you look at their description of us on their website they called us
[01:50:02.680 --> 01:50:08.520]  dangerous individuals and if you go to the facebook uh description of what it means to be a dangerous
[01:50:08.520 --> 01:50:14.120]  individual well you have to be promoting mass murder or violence or be a terrorist or be encouraging
[01:50:14.120 --> 01:50:18.360]  mass violence i have never no you're right i laugh about this and the whole the whole name of the
[01:50:18.360 --> 01:50:24.440]  show is journalists designated as terrorist facebook tries to kill journalists i mean no no you're
[01:50:24.440 --> 01:50:29.080]  right in fact watch them looked it up and it's actually in the filing they normally only would
[01:50:29.080 --> 01:50:34.200]  say that i mean hezbollah and amos still have accounts we don't right yeah and that's the basis
[01:50:34.200 --> 01:50:39.080]  of my lawsuit against twitter which people have been so reluctant to share i don't know why you
[01:50:39.080 --> 01:50:44.200]  know look alex i'm gonna be very frank with you i am so sick and tired of watching conservatives
[01:50:44.200 --> 01:50:48.920]  complain about social media you have you have two choices you either fight or you don't fight and if
[01:50:48.920 --> 01:50:53.720]  you don't want to fight then stay the hell away from me because no i totally agree a lot of conservatives
[01:50:53.720 --> 01:50:59.880]  are glad ferricans being censored no they're censoring everybody you idiots every single time
[01:50:59.880 --> 01:51:04.520]  someone gets banned it turns into a circus and everyone says oh oh everyone's banned oh president
[01:51:04.520 --> 01:51:09.560]  trump help us please do something okay but what are they doing is anyone giving me money to fund
[01:51:09.560 --> 01:51:15.480]  my lawsuit in which uh i'm suing twitter and care because care which is a designated islamic terrorist
[01:51:15.480 --> 01:51:20.600]  organization tied to amos and the muslim brotherhood lobbied facebook and twitter to ban me like do
[01:51:20.600 --> 01:51:25.480]  people not understand that those of us who have been silenced have actually taken legal action
[01:51:25.480 --> 01:51:29.640]  oh i don't think they get it's a total war no i totally agree people need to pony up
[01:51:29.640 --> 01:51:34.360]  and support you they need to support us well just tweeting about it i want people to actually do
[01:51:34.360 --> 01:51:39.640]  something okay we need your money we need your support help fund my lawsuit give me some money
[01:51:39.640 --> 01:51:44.040]  to fund my lawsuit so i could take these people and defeat them in court okay where were all the
[01:51:44.040 --> 01:51:49.000]  conservatives the other night when i projected your name and info wars and everybody who has been banned
[01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:53.960]  onto the home of jack dorsey not a single conservative tweeted my video not a single

[01:53:03.560 --> 01:53:10.040]  be able to send text messages because trump's done nothing he's green-lighted this well i've given my
[01:53:10.040 --> 01:53:14.360]  life for president trump i mean how do you think i feel you know from the time i was 20 years old
[01:53:14.360 --> 01:53:18.360]  i started working for project erotos i was undercover in the hillary clinton campaign
[01:53:18.360 --> 01:53:22.920]  exposing the hillary clinton campaign and exposing them for voter fraud president trump
[01:53:22.920 --> 01:53:27.720]  tweeted my undercover videos probably without even knowing who i was when he was running for president
[01:53:27.720 --> 01:53:33.640]  knows that for a long time you've been in dangerous frontline activity in my life and my career for
[01:53:33.640 --> 01:53:39.320]  president trump and not once has he called me not once has he tweeted me not once has he said thank
[01:53:39.320 --> 01:53:43.720]  you not because they don't get we're the battle-hardened people with blood and guts hanging out
[01:53:43.720 --> 01:53:47.800]  because we're on the front line and all these little pretty ninny show don't get involved with
[01:53:47.800 --> 01:53:53.240]  the combat troops stand back from them they've been attacked by the system yeah because we're up front
[01:53:53.240 --> 01:53:57.800]  speeding we're fighting fire-breathing dragons we're bleeding and then everybody sits back
[01:53:57.800 --> 01:54:03.960]  we've been demonized and go stay away from them they've been in combat well why not stay away from
[01:54:03.960 --> 01:54:09.640]  trump then all the lies they tell about him trump has to get this they just read my wikipedia page
[01:54:09.640 --> 01:54:13.880]  and they call me crazy you know i'm so sick and tired of seeing conservatives online like the
[01:54:13.880 --> 01:54:18.200]  bench of pyro types and all these establishment types mock me and call me they're playing it safe
[01:54:18.200 --> 01:54:22.920]  laura they don't have the wavos you've got they're playing it safe these are pretenders that were
[01:54:22.920 --> 01:54:28.200]  even against trump who jumped on the bandwagon and now they're all cozyed up to trump and everybody
[01:54:28.200 --> 01:54:34.440]  because they're the little cutesies that google leaves alone yeah well i don't need all these men
[01:54:34.440 --> 01:54:38.600]  that behind their twitter accounts talking crap about me because first of all i have bigger balls
[01:54:38.600 --> 01:54:43.080]  and all these men combined and if they want to talk about me and call me crazy then they can go
[01:54:43.080 --> 01:54:47.400]  they can go confront jack dorsi in front of congress or they can go confront they can like
[01:54:47.400 --> 01:54:52.280]  what we did together or they can go fancy plosives house like you did absolutely no you're an example
[01:54:52.280 --> 01:54:56.120]  lauren it's true that's why you always get criticized and attacked by all the backbenchers
[01:54:56.120 --> 01:54:59.160]  and all the people that aren't in the damn arena i don't want to hear their crap they need to be in
[01:54:59.160 --> 01:55:03.480]  the arena bars uh no question about it i mean the the suit that's been brought on her behalf by
[01:55:03.480 --> 01:55:08.200]  ron colman who's one of the best lawyers in the country good in this area he's also doing the suit
[01:55:08.200 --> 01:55:11.880]  for gavin mckinnis against the southern poverty law center it's brought in florida and it's brought
[01:55:11.880 --> 01:55:15.960]  on it's some legal theories that ron and i have discussed for several years which is to how to go
[01:55:15.960 --> 01:55:21.720]  at social media in a ways to get past the sense of immunity that judges think they have the uh as
[01:55:21.720 --> 01:55:26.520]  they don't they're acting like horrible racketeers oh no question and the interesting thing is some
[01:55:26.520 --> 01:55:29.640]  of the suits they're bringing against other people they're going to establish the precedent to bring
[01:55:29.640 --> 01:55:33.560]  suits against them probably they didn't think that through all the way but so for example
[01:55:33.560 --> 01:55:37.400]  it and he's he's pursuing things like tortuous interference because the allegation is that
[01:55:37.400 --> 01:55:41.560]  essentially care which is an organization that has been designated here is in the washington
[01:55:41.560 --> 01:55:46.600]  post saying i'm an anti-semite and her name's there too a bunch of his llamasus saying that
[01:55:46.600 --> 01:55:51.000]  she's anti-israel this is a load of crap and care has been previously identified as recorded
[01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:54.280]  what he identifies in the suit is the care has been previously identified as affiliated with
[01:55:54.280 --> 01:55:59.240]  various actual terrorist causes and cases muslim brotherhood correct uh the so when you look at that
[01:55:59.240 --> 01:56:03.800]  uh what you have is care using their political power and their economic connections with facebook
[01:56:03.800 --> 01:56:08.440]  and social media to try to target certain people that's the new the new thing is if you criticize
[01:56:08.440 --> 01:56:12.520]  radical islam your band they say that in the washington post what they've done is they did
[01:56:12.520 --> 01:56:18.120]  what what loomers cases is about in florida against care and against twitter they've they've taken
[01:56:18.120 --> 01:56:23.400]  to an entirely new level now because now they've now they have cnn you have guys like oliver darsie
[01:56:23.400 --> 01:56:28.200]  going on cnn saying hey by the way i'm i'm basically trying to cause you to not be able to be able

[01:56:57.720 --> 01:57:03.160]  and i said oliver why are you working with twitter and facebook to ban people like alex jones how much
[01:57:03.160 --> 01:57:08.520]  are you getting paid to ban conservatives and then what happened matt schlapp okay he had me banned

[02:00:51.720 --> 02:00:59.320]  loomer with a t-shirt a free laura loomer or free loomer dot com uh what do you why do you think
[02:00:59.320 --> 02:01:04.280]  they've they've done this i guess because they see trump green lighting it uh not doing anything so far
[02:01:06.200 --> 02:01:09.960]  whereas i mean i get your pissed off you're fighting hard every time i'm in the trenches i see you
[02:01:09.960 --> 02:01:17.800]  there yeah well i mean what do you think trump should do what should we do where do you see this
[02:01:17.800 --> 02:01:21.960]  going because trump doesn't get his own videos get banned and shadow banned and blocked when we
[02:01:21.960 --> 02:01:26.680]  promote him i mean trump just thinks well i can overpower this myself no you can't plus he's if
[02:01:26.680 --> 02:01:36.040]  he doesn't do something he's aiding and abetting this what do you think laura yeah um well i wish
[02:01:36.040 --> 02:01:41.320]  that he would do something like i said i confronted congress and when jack dorky was testifying in
[02:01:41.320 --> 02:01:45.480]  september and i begged president trump i begged him to do something before it was too late and
[02:01:45.480 --> 02:01:51.800]  that was when i still had access to my uh my my twitter account right but i was mocked right look
[02:01:51.800 --> 02:02:00.280]  at that asshole billy long in congress who decided to do an auction call over it's
[02:02:00.280 --> 02:02:06.200]  mocked me and called me crazy but what are they doing i want to know what people are actually going to do
[02:02:06.200 --> 02:02:13.560]  my life is ruined does anybody understand how ruined my life is i'm sick of it i don't want to
[02:02:13.560 --> 02:02:18.760]  listen to people tell me that i'm a conspiracy theorist they don't know what it's like to be me
[02:02:18.760 --> 02:02:26.200]  my fucking life is ruined alex no i understand i just think you need to go with it and uh you
[02:02:26.200 --> 02:02:30.520]  know i just i understand i've been through this myself but realize these are wars these are hard
[02:02:30.520 --> 02:02:34.840]  but i know your frustration laura you wouldn't feel bad if more men were standing up you know
[02:02:34.840 --> 02:02:39.720]  dredge report promotes what you're doing others do the president i actually did tweet about you
[02:02:39.720 --> 02:02:45.720]  and um i don't know if you knew this about you and what's in being banned so so that way but i i mean
[02:02:45.720 --> 02:02:51.480]  i agree tweeting isn't enough but at least the president is concerned about it okay he's concerned
[02:02:51.480 --> 02:02:56.200]  about it but that's not going to stop the fact that i've lost 90 percent of my income that's not
[02:02:56.200 --> 02:03:01.080]  going to stop the fact that i literally can't make a living i mean more even though i have a degree
[02:03:01.080 --> 02:03:07.080]  i was valedictorian in college i graduated top of my class in my journalism program and i can't
[02:03:07.080 --> 02:03:11.640]  know i get it you've been in the trenches six years and delivered nothing but the goods and
[02:03:11.640 --> 02:03:16.600]  then now you're wondering as a soldier in this fight why nobody even will give you a can of beans
[02:03:16.600 --> 02:03:22.360]  nobody and i'm sick of it i'm fighting harder than most conservatives i'm fighting harder than
[02:03:22.360 --> 02:03:27.480]  anybody and i'm being destroyed and they mock me and they say i'm some crazy conspiracy well
[02:03:27.480 --> 02:03:33.240]  that's what happens laura leaders so it but i hear you and trump's been so surrounded by the
[02:03:33.240 --> 02:03:38.520]  rusher gake dang that he's been paralyzed by that but he better do something now and no i agree with
[02:03:38.520 --> 02:03:45.800]  you you know i'm sick of watching all this stuff go on and i'm pissed too i don't want to hear what
[02:03:45.800 --> 02:03:51.080]  you're saying these people don't understand like my life is unlivable at this point in time like
[02:03:51.080 --> 02:03:56.520]  what is the point don't don't don't say that laura you're a hero to a lot of people now they
[02:03:56.520 --> 02:04:02.360]  had whispered yeah i'm 25 years old and i don't want to live the rest of my life i could potentially
[02:04:02.360 --> 02:04:07.400]  live 75 more years you know what i'm saying and like my life now i have to worry about getting
[02:04:07.400 --> 02:04:12.600]  murdered by leftists and muslims every single time i know it's disgusting oh i know i know they're

[02:06:46.040 --> 02:06:52.280]  really discovered by poll Watson and info wars resigns from turning point usa after calls for
[02:06:52.280 --> 02:06:58.840]  her to be fired and people inside turning point usa literally going along with the mainstream media
[02:06:58.840 --> 02:07:02.600]  in that out of context thing about hitlers of a black woman likes hitler she's talking about
[02:07:02.600 --> 02:07:08.360]  nationals versus not nationalism so he wasn't a nationalist and she resigned from her position
[02:07:08.360 --> 02:07:12.920]  even though she knocked it out of the park in congress she's so beautiful so smart hey kandace
[02:07:12.920 --> 02:07:18.200]  now that you get it don't get a job here we tried to hire her and she got busy and they all swooped

[02:07:24.520 --> 02:07:31.160]  bs uh it's just incredible i was scheduled to be on her uh podcast when i went to la but then she
[02:07:31.160 --> 02:07:35.640]  had to get some in the congress i couldn't do it and she's just super smart people said oh you're
[02:07:35.640 --> 02:07:40.360]  saying a black person's smart that's patronizing no i meant from anybody she's smart she's like
[02:07:40.360 --> 02:07:46.040]  i'll just like i'll say ted cruz is smart she's really smart she's really intuitive she gets it
[02:07:46.040 --> 02:07:50.680]  and she caught the left trying to set her up in false flagger and maybe she's right to resign she's
[02:07:50.680 --> 02:07:55.640]  just doesn't want to be around these people but turning point usa that's all they had with kandace
[02:07:55.640 --> 02:08:01.320]  owens so uh they were saying she's an anti-semite just everyone in dc wants to roll over to corporate
[02:08:01.320 --> 02:08:07.800]  media and roll over to democrats as double agents they come and they say we're gonna audit you and
[02:08:07.800 --> 02:08:11.960]  destroy you unless you give us intel on trump unless you sabotage new whisper campaigns
[02:08:12.680 --> 02:08:17.000]  and then people that roll over they go now we know that you sold out the president we're gonna
[02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:22.040]  tell them if you don't that's how they compromise you and they're all little kids they're all little
[02:08:22.040 --> 02:08:27.160]  kids like people call me up and they go yeah we're probably you're not gonna be living along if you
[02:08:27.160 --> 02:08:31.720]  don't turn against trump i go we get ready to go to war or you know the games they play and then
[02:08:31.720 --> 02:08:36.040]  they leave you alone the people don't get like when you start bending over to these wolves they
[02:08:36.040 --> 02:08:40.120]  rape the daylights out of you so you don't want to be where everybody's shiny and telling you
[02:08:40.120 --> 02:08:45.080]  you're good you want to be in the war and kandace you're good-looking you're smart you're authentic
[02:08:45.080 --> 02:08:50.520]  you're real they're scared of you and the fact that this shows the disease inside the trump
[02:08:50.520 --> 02:08:54.120]  operation and i'm not saying they're all bad i don't know who's good and who's bad i don't get
[02:08:54.120 --> 02:08:59.560]  in the inner fights i just know this this country's getting screwed over and the president figured out
[02:08:59.560 --> 02:09:03.160]  that the private federal reserve was killing the recovery he told him stop it and they stopped it
[02:09:03.160 --> 02:09:09.000]  and the damn big tech is raping everybody's rights openly saying whose name you can say
[02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:17.400]  it's not just an american it's anti-human it's twilight zone on pcp it's crazy town and i want
[02:09:17.400 --> 02:09:22.440]  action and i want it now go ahead well it's really sort of out as huxley but even huxley didn't
[02:09:22.440 --> 02:09:27.480]  imagine this kind of world it's uh it's a well-earned beyond or well it's uh basically it's beyond
[02:09:27.480 --> 02:09:32.760]  1984 it would be like if you wrote a sequel to beyond 1984 the first chapter would be they banned
[02:09:32.760 --> 02:09:37.160]  the name of a person from being used in the social or public media discourse or even in their own
[02:09:37.160 --> 02:09:41.240]  private conversation because that's effectively what's happening when you're saying that private
[02:09:41.240 --> 02:09:45.160]  chat groups that's what facebook is doing now they're saying you cannot use the name of alex
[02:09:45.160 --> 02:09:51.720]  jones or info wars in private chat groups that that just two days ago zuckerberg promised was
[02:09:51.720 --> 02:09:56.600]  going to be private we're gonna and they just think that's gonna wear off we're not gonna accept it
[02:09:56.600 --> 02:10:02.120]  you put damn robots in our house that watches and now tells we can say completely and at some point
[02:10:02.120 --> 02:10:06.600]  the well it's it goes back to the old panopticon system that bentham talked about that how do you
[02:10:06.600 --> 02:10:11.720]  create a cult exactly uh how do you create a system where people are going to monitor themselves
[02:10:11.720 --> 02:10:15.640]  uh like when fuko was doing that his entire study of how the prison system and the mental
[02:10:15.640 --> 02:10:20.280]  health systems had changed over time over societies and over history what he was identifying there's
[02:10:20.280 --> 02:10:24.760]  a lot of things about fuko i don't agree with but here his analysis was excellent yeah the gay gang
[02:10:24.760 --> 02:10:29.400]  banks run into that but the whole point is getting into panopticonic where you surveil yourself
[02:10:29.400 --> 02:10:33.960]  you censor yourself exactly that's the goal is to have surveillance trigger self-censorship
[02:10:33.960 --> 02:10:38.040]  punishment an economic punishment of someone's actions that does allowing a civil tort to go
[02:10:38.040 --> 02:10:42.600]  forward or a civil suit to go forward when they're in ways that are going to self-censor
[02:10:42.600 --> 02:10:46.760]  speech that that the whole point of the first amendment rules is to not allow that to happen
[02:10:46.760 --> 02:10:50.840]  here what's happening is they're using surveillance to suppress using surveillance to censor
[02:10:50.840 --> 02:10:55.000]  but now they're going further they're being the actual censor and how would you quantify
[02:10:56.200 --> 02:11:02.120]  this period in history with the left being so insane so bullish their minions being so weak
[02:11:02.120 --> 02:11:06.120]  but they've got so much corporate power and their ally with the chai comms in e you i mean
[02:11:06.120 --> 02:11:12.600]  they're formidable force but they're like a giant rotting hydra that as it stumbles forward it's dying
[02:11:12.600 --> 02:11:18.600]  but more heads grow out of the scruffulous mass and then meanwhile we put up with it because we're
[02:11:18.600 --> 02:11:23.080]  not used to censorship like this and we still believe we're free well how would you describe
[02:11:23.080 --> 02:11:28.440]  the gestalt it's very much sort of a recreation of the inquisition era mindset and we're really
[02:11:28.440 --> 02:11:32.840]  facing a defining time of either the american model of free speech free thought free ideas and
[02:11:32.840 --> 02:11:37.160]  free press is going to remain in free market or we're going to be in a society where the chinese
[02:11:37.160 --> 02:11:42.040]  social credit system is works in the in the big tech and so that's it that's the dichotomy that's
[02:11:42.040 --> 02:11:45.960]  the choice absolutely and big tech is pursuing the chinese social credit system i mean i guarantee
[02:11:45.960 --> 02:11:50.600]  you that china one mastercard says they're gonna watch what you buy not the host they're gonna
[02:11:50.600 --> 02:11:54.680]  watch what you do buddy not only that you might buy a nazi book to see what they're saying you
[02:11:54.680 --> 02:12:00.920]  don't agree with it you're getting hurt absolutely god that's evil any people scared to say oh i can't
[02:12:00.920 --> 02:12:05.240]  say alex jones's name or something bad might happen to me i can't say info war's name or
[02:12:05.240 --> 02:12:10.280]  something bad might happen to me it's trying to create a culture of self-censorship to where
[02:12:10.280 --> 02:12:15.400]  ordinary everyday people are afraid to talk about what they want to talk about we have their own
[02:12:15.400 --> 02:12:20.520]  chilling effect the stifling but here's the goodness they failed failed failed failed failed failed
[02:12:20.520 --> 02:12:24.200]  we failed to realize how serious isn't even more angry but we have enough of our instincts
[02:12:24.200 --> 02:12:28.200]  to where we've kind of halfway gotten up we're beating them so they've just gone to their
[02:12:28.200 --> 02:12:32.840]  end game 20 years from now surveillance in real time of links watching everything you do
[02:12:32.840 --> 02:12:38.600]  everyone having to go into a facebook bedtime story where the police officer asks you all the
[02:12:38.600 --> 02:12:43.560]  the commas are asked all the questions they've accelerated to their final black hole destination
[02:12:43.560 --> 02:12:48.680]  in a hope that will rook us out of our victory i see this as desperation well absolutely because
[02:12:48.680 --> 02:12:54.200]  the the main thing they underestimated because of their echo chamber existence is the two great
[02:12:54.200 --> 02:12:58.600]  schools of learning that can never be closed years ago a great scholar said back during the dark
[02:12:58.600 --> 02:13:03.160]  ages so there's two great scholars at the church the state nobody can suppress and those are the
[02:13:03.160 --> 02:13:07.160]  archives of nature and the rights of man the conscience of ordinary people and their ability
[02:13:07.160 --> 02:13:11.880]  to use their own faculty of reason and their own natures will exactly that that people they thought
[02:13:11.880 --> 02:13:17.080]  they could stop people from supporting info wars supporting alex jones supporting their own choice
[02:13:17.080 --> 02:13:21.720]  of news and views and they can't because the power of the individual's conscience the power of the
[02:13:21.720 --> 02:13:26.760]  individual's own mind to make up their own mind to act on their own mind sure is a power they just
[02:13:26.760 --> 02:13:31.240]  cannot but i think they're only trick they're counting on is this they hear about bands so long
[02:13:31.240 --> 02:13:35.240]  that when the super band comes people already heard about the earlier bands they're kind of like
[02:13:35.240 --> 02:13:39.320]  and because i would think we'd see massive financial spike and support we're not really seeing that
[02:13:39.320 --> 02:13:43.720]  right now because people are kind of used yeah old alex you know godzilla's out there fighting
[02:13:43.720 --> 02:13:49.240]  megalon hill wind don't worry no this godzilla's like bleeding and like flopping around being bitten
[02:13:49.240 --> 02:13:53.880]  by seven-headed monsters i need some damn money okay and by the way one sick part of me wants
[02:13:53.880 --> 02:13:58.680]  this to fail and go away and give up but my guts can't quit so i'm just telling you man we need
[02:13:58.680 --> 02:14:03.240]  some damn money here and i'll sell you the best products anyways get in there buy them and sign
[02:14:03.240 --> 02:14:07.400]  up for auto ship there's a total war and i don't want to give up i can't give up and that's the
[02:14:07.400 --> 02:14:11.080]  main thing they've underestimated is the power of the ordinary person to use their own faculties of
[02:14:11.080 --> 02:14:15.720]  reason and act on their own conscience to do as they see fit to support whom they want to back
[02:14:15.720 --> 02:14:20.360]  whom they want to make sure certain voices are heard against the attempts at censorship and
[02:14:20.360 --> 02:14:26.360]  suppression bob i can't believe it's so art-type it's like a cartoon tyranny it's so flaming and
[02:14:26.360 --> 02:14:31.960]  ridiculous and crazy we're going to kill babies after they're born and families are bad and big
[02:14:31.960 --> 02:14:36.840]  dudes can compete in women's contest and be all the powerlifting champions it's like upside down
[02:14:36.840 --> 02:14:41.640]  easter bunny world it's completely it's stranger things on steroids so it's a completely different
[02:14:41.640 --> 02:14:45.400]  world and a completely different reality they're trying to create and they really believe because
[02:14:45.400 --> 02:14:49.560]  that they operate too much in the hollywood space and so i think they really believe so they're
[02:14:49.560 --> 02:14:54.120]  delusional completely and they keep trying to project what they want and they think they can
[02:14:54.120 --> 02:14:57.160]  create their own reality they think they can script their own story no matter how insane no
[02:14:57.160 --> 02:15:01.320]  matter how crazy no matter how lunatic so i mean i mean half of them think they're are they actually
[02:15:01.320 --> 02:15:05.560]  are living in a simulation and so they want to make us that's what's our crazy silicon values
[02:15:05.560 --> 02:15:11.240]  so they want to make us comport as npcs precisely they want to make us it's just like tron the original
[02:15:11.240 --> 02:15:16.120]  tron the master program you're gonna join me and it's like i mean these are people who who grew up
[02:15:16.120 --> 02:15:21.400]  on tron right who really think oh rather than looking at tron or orwell or or huxley as a
[02:15:21.400 --> 02:15:26.280]  dangerous thing to be afraid of to fear to want to resist they saw him as things to embrace and
[02:15:26.280 --> 02:15:30.920]  emulate exactly let me use a tron analogy like when the main system says all my systems are yours
[02:15:31.880 --> 02:15:36.200]  that's the systems all in i need your systems and that doesn't mean to enslave you i see your
[02:15:36.200 --> 02:15:40.040]  prayers and financial support because like i'll grow 100 feet tall and take these guys on but i
[02:15:40.040 --> 02:15:45.080]  mean that's literally when you give us money you spread the word i get stronger they get weaker
[02:15:45.080 --> 02:15:50.600]  so i need your will i need you to support me i need it now

[02:22:51.320 --> 02:22:56.680]  oliver darcy joins me now so what more do we know about this ban and who else is included yeah this
[02:22:56.680 --> 02:23:01.800]  is a very strict action from facebook erica basically they've deemed these individuals to be
[02:23:01.800 --> 02:23:06.120]  dangerous is what facebook is saying those individuals include nation of islam leader
[02:23:06.120 --> 02:23:11.080]  lewis ferrican who has a history of anti-semitic remarks people like right-wing conspiracy theorist
[02:23:11.080 --> 02:23:15.640]  alex jones and then also some right-wing media personalities who are pretty popular online
[02:23:15.640 --> 02:23:21.400]  people like milo yanopoulos laura loomer paul joseph watson those people are banned as well as a
[02:23:21.400 --> 02:23:24.920]  failed congressional candidate paul nailin who had made a number of anti-semitic remarks
[02:23:25.480 --> 02:23:29.640]  facebook has given us a statement and they do say in their statements i read part of it to you
[02:23:29.640 --> 02:23:34.920]  right now they say that we will always be an individual again illan omore all of them say
[02:23:34.920 --> 02:23:38.600]  stuff way worse than that i say that they have a right to say it but the way seeing it in them
[02:23:38.600 --> 02:23:44.680]  ignore it and then ban laura loomer for criticizing illan omore's anti-semitic comments and then say
[02:23:44.680 --> 02:23:52.760]  she's an anti-semite the brazen lies it's it's it's so bizarre well the they want to be able to
[02:23:52.760 --> 02:23:58.200]  have the sole platform i mean it's very much taking the safe space ideology that's that took off on
[02:23:58.200 --> 02:24:03.560]  college campuses over the past half decade and making it these ideology across the board making it
[02:24:03.560 --> 02:24:09.400]  the he's saying you will watch me i am god well i mean you because how do they get so pretentious
[02:24:09.400 --> 02:24:14.360]  like what is the gene to think you're in charge everyone must do what you say it's an ideology
[02:24:14.360 --> 02:24:17.800]  that they've grown up with of the way the academy and the public schools and the public and universities
[02:24:17.800 --> 02:24:21.880]  have been teaching people is not to defend and be a guardian of free speech free thought and free
[02:24:21.880 --> 02:24:27.560]  ideas but to be a guardian of the right thought and to prevent and to prohibit wrong think and
[02:24:27.560 --> 02:24:31.400]  that's their mentality they think they are the guardians the special guardians chosen to make
[02:24:31.400 --> 02:24:35.160]  sure that only the right ideas are there the intellectuals you know exactly let's finish
[02:24:35.160 --> 02:24:40.440]  up with the club here it is it's a read part of it to you right now um they say that we've
[02:24:40.440 --> 02:24:46.040]  always banned individuals or organizations always always that's a complete lie regardless of ideology
[02:24:46.040 --> 02:24:50.520]  the process for evaluating potential violators is extensive and it is what led us to our decisions
[02:24:50.520 --> 02:24:56.360]  to remove these accounts today um facebook told me that the process they use is to engage
[02:24:56.360 --> 02:25:01.480]  number of factors uh have the promoted uh hate speech on facebook have they been banned for
[02:25:01.480 --> 02:25:06.280]  violating the rules in the past have they self described themselves as part of a hate movement
[02:25:06.280 --> 02:25:10.040]  or hate ideology those are the factors that facebook was weighing and you know they're
[02:25:10.040 --> 02:25:15.400]  taking this really strict action moment to pause again we've had a secret star chamber and we
[02:25:15.400 --> 02:25:21.560]  just say so and i've got bug eyes like cookie monster so it's okay and then now he says they
[02:25:21.560 --> 02:25:28.200]  shouldn't be able to use telephones that's right text messages it's coming and banning from facebook
[02:25:28.200 --> 02:25:32.840]  and instagram correct yes facebook obviously owns instagram and so someone like alex jones had been
[02:25:32.840 --> 02:25:37.880]  banned from facebook a while back last year on the summer but he was still having a presence on
[02:25:37.880 --> 02:25:42.280]  instagram and they had drawn a lot of scrutiny from people who are saying hey you know you guys
[02:25:42.280 --> 02:25:46.040]  banned them from one of your platforms why are you allowing them to have a presence on instagram
[02:25:46.040 --> 02:25:52.200]  and so yes now facebook is going to banning alex jones and info wars from not only their main
[02:25:52.200 --> 02:25:56.280]  platform facebook but also from instagram um i checked in also to see if these people would
[02:25:56.280 --> 02:26:01.400]  be banned from whatsapp which is also owned by facebook um and a spokesperson cannot say immediately
[02:26:01.400 --> 02:26:06.280]  because it's i guess unclear whether some of these people have uh whatsapp accounts according
[02:26:06.280 --> 02:26:10.840]  to spokesperson so they are thousands of companies i guess they buy my water company like
[02:26:10.840 --> 02:26:16.200]  all we're checking to see if he's getting water from facebook we turned his water off
[02:26:16.200 --> 02:26:21.080]  that we own the oxygen now we're seeing if he got the oxygen from us well knowing that facebook's
[02:26:21.080 --> 02:26:24.680]  announcing today that they plan on exploring cryptocurrency that they want to have their
[02:26:24.680 --> 02:26:29.560]  own currency and so ultimately they would control everything they would control your ability to buy
[02:26:29.560 --> 02:26:33.960]  anything to sell anything to receive anything all of it all they would have complete monopolies
[02:26:33.960 --> 02:26:39.320]  and all of it does he will decide well i love the way he said he checked in checked in right and
[02:26:39.320 --> 02:26:45.880]  then not i made a uh investigative inquiry and you know called someone i checked in as if he was
[02:26:45.880 --> 02:26:50.760]  complicit and part of the system that's an interesting choice although they have a whole system
[02:26:50.760 --> 02:26:55.400]  under the countering foreign disinformation propaganda run by the cia with the media recruiting
[02:26:55.400 --> 02:27:01.480]  everyone with interfaces and 70 000 southern poverty law center trained skw's that's their new job
[02:27:01.480 --> 02:27:05.800]  well we've had former employees here that go that's the jobs they get they become leftist
[02:27:05.800 --> 02:27:10.280]  they go have little terminal jobs and they're in your email your photos it's like oh we write
[02:27:10.280 --> 02:27:15.640]  everything oh it's so liberal yeah it's amazing i mean they're stasi agents absolutely i mean it's
[02:27:15.640 --> 02:27:19.800]  what ultimately they try to come to our events our meetings and spy on us it's just like god you're
[02:27:19.800 --> 02:27:23.400]  pathetic we'll just show the degree of sort of coordination it's the real collusion that's
[02:27:23.400 --> 02:27:28.280]  taking place the real collusion is between big media and big tech to silence and suppress both
[02:27:28.280 --> 02:27:33.160]  competitors and conservatives and independent dissident voices that on the populist side of
[02:27:33.160 --> 02:27:37.800]  the political spectrum that helped elect president trump that helped elect uh the Bolsonaro in brazil
[02:27:37.800 --> 02:27:42.200]  that helped elect people all across the world in the populist movement that's spreading literally
[02:27:42.200 --> 02:27:46.040]  across the world and they're they're doing so in order to be able to not only coordinate and
[02:27:46.040 --> 02:27:50.840]  control what happens i mean this is real collusion this is real as paul referred to it real election
[02:27:50.840 --> 02:27:55.640]  meddling uh unlike you know a few facebook ads that nobody ever saw read or reviewed and when they
[02:27:55.640 --> 02:28:00.600]  did this found them funny and weird this is actual attempts to coordinate and to manipulate the
[02:28:00.600 --> 02:28:05.320]  election results by not allowing you to hear the independent voices you are totally correct
[02:28:05.320 --> 02:28:09.240]  mr barnes we come back we've got the they've relaunched human events which is always a great

[02:33:55.840 --> 02:33:57.840]  We're getting ahead of human events on relaunched
[02:33:57.840 --> 02:33:59.840]  important conservative newspaper.
[02:33:59.840 --> 02:34:01.840]  Robert Barnes right in shotgun here, constitutional lawyer.
[02:34:01.840 --> 02:34:03.840]  Let me ask you this question.
[02:34:03.840 --> 02:34:08.840]  This is so reckless, so brazen, so naked.
[02:34:08.840 --> 02:34:11.840]  So crazy, so over the top.
[02:34:11.840 --> 02:34:14.840]  But I guess we've been acquiescing so long
[02:34:14.840 --> 02:34:17.840]  that we've allowed this type of extreme behavior
[02:34:17.840 --> 02:34:19.840]  by our acquiescens.
[02:34:19.840 --> 02:34:22.840]  What comes next if we submit to them live time
[02:34:22.840 --> 02:34:25.840]  in our text messages, in our phone calls
[02:34:25.840 --> 02:34:27.840]  and in banning words we can use?
[02:34:27.840 --> 02:34:28.840]  I mean, what comes next?
[02:34:28.840 --> 02:34:29.840]  Well, that's what's going to happen.
[02:34:29.840 --> 02:34:31.840]  So something will be a trending topic.
[02:34:31.840 --> 02:34:33.840]  And they'll use AI if it's a trending topic
[02:34:33.840 --> 02:34:34.840]  that favors the political right
[02:34:34.840 --> 02:34:35.840]  or favors the independent left
[02:34:35.840 --> 02:34:37.840]  or favors the independent political press
[02:34:37.840 --> 02:34:40.840]  or challenges any institutional or established narrative.
[02:34:40.840 --> 02:34:42.840]  Ban, just ban it, suppress it.
[02:34:42.840 --> 02:34:44.840]  It may be only do it for 24 hours or 48 hours
[02:34:44.840 --> 02:34:46.840]  over a critical time period.
[02:34:46.840 --> 02:34:47.840]  But that effectively will do it.
[02:34:47.840 --> 02:34:50.840]  They actually tested this in the French elections
[02:34:50.840 --> 02:34:52.840]  when they wanted to make sure the pen laws.
[02:34:52.840 --> 02:34:55.840]  But for 48 hours they banned certain kind of activities
[02:34:55.840 --> 02:34:56.840]  on social medias.
[02:34:56.840 --> 02:34:57.840]  And they saw the populist party in Spain
[02:34:57.840 --> 02:34:59.840]  peaking a week ago, they banned it for a while.
[02:34:59.840 --> 02:35:01.840]  Exactly, they banned it from even communicating.
[02:35:01.840 --> 02:35:03.840]  So we've seen what the EU model looks like.
[02:35:03.840 --> 02:35:05.840]  We've seen what the Chinese social credit model looks like.
[02:35:05.840 --> 02:35:06.840]  They're just accelerating.
[02:35:06.840 --> 02:35:08.840]  So we're in a technocracy.
[02:35:08.840 --> 02:35:09.840]  Absolutely.
[02:35:09.840 --> 02:35:10.840]  And it should be outlawed.
[02:35:10.840 --> 02:35:12.840]  The government should be able to see the Republicans.
[02:35:12.840 --> 02:35:13.840]  I think even some of the Trumps will go,
[02:35:13.840 --> 02:35:15.840]  well, wait, it's a power we'll get in control of.
[02:35:15.840 --> 02:35:16.840]  No, you won't.
[02:35:16.840 --> 02:35:17.840]  Get rid of it.
[02:35:17.840 --> 02:35:18.840]  Stop it.
[02:35:18.840 --> 02:35:19.840]  Precisely.
[02:35:19.840 --> 02:35:20.840]  It's a direct threat to the core foundational,
[02:35:20.840 --> 02:35:22.840]  fundamental freedoms of the United States Constitution
[02:35:22.840 --> 02:35:23.840]  and the Bill of Rights.
[02:35:23.840 --> 02:35:24.840]  So if you go back to Rhode Island
[02:35:24.840 --> 02:35:27.840]  where all of my Barnes family members are from
[02:35:27.840 --> 02:35:28.840]  back at the time of the Constitution,
[02:35:28.840 --> 02:35:30.840]  you go and you look at the old voting rolls
[02:35:30.840 --> 02:35:32.840]  and you say they all voted no against the Constitution
[02:35:32.840 --> 02:35:34.840]  because it did not yet include the Bill of Rights.
[02:35:34.840 --> 02:35:36.840]  They would only approve of it once it had the
[02:35:36.840 --> 02:35:37.840]  Bill of Rights in it.
[02:35:37.840 --> 02:35:38.840]  And the very first amendment,
[02:35:38.840 --> 02:35:40.840]  the very first part of that first Bill of Rights
[02:35:40.840 --> 02:35:43.840]  is that no law can pass or nothing should happen
[02:35:43.840 --> 02:35:46.840]  in civil society that abridges the freedom of press
[02:35:46.840 --> 02:35:47.840]  or freedom of speech.
[02:35:47.840 --> 02:35:49.840]  So what is it in individuals?
[02:35:49.840 --> 02:35:52.840]  Because I've found powerful, smart, cool people
[02:35:52.840 --> 02:35:54.840]  always believe in free speech because they're so confident.
[02:35:54.840 --> 02:35:56.840]  There's always kind of weird technocrats,
[02:35:56.840 --> 02:35:58.840]  serpent people that don't.
[02:35:58.840 --> 02:35:59.840]  And there's kind of dumbed down folks
[02:35:59.840 --> 02:36:00.840]  that don't agree with speech either.
[02:36:00.840 --> 02:36:03.840]  But I just don't get why other people don't value it.
[02:36:03.840 --> 02:36:05.840]  It obviously creates a better civilization.
[02:36:05.840 --> 02:36:06.840]  What's happened?
[02:36:06.840 --> 02:36:08.840]  I think there's a lot of good professors in sociology
[02:36:08.840 --> 02:36:10.840]  and other areas who have described it.
[02:36:10.840 --> 02:36:12.840]  It's basically a safe space culture
[02:36:12.840 --> 02:36:15.840]  that due to the media overreacting to kidnapping stories
[02:36:15.840 --> 02:36:17.840]  in the 80s and the 90s,
[02:36:17.840 --> 02:36:18.840]  what happened was an entire generation...
[02:36:18.840 --> 02:36:19.840]  We're wimps now.
[02:36:19.840 --> 02:36:20.840]  Absolutely.
[02:36:20.840 --> 02:36:21.840]  And now even lawyers that are suing us
[02:36:21.840 --> 02:36:23.840]  and saying horrible things about me,
[02:36:23.840 --> 02:36:25.840]  they're like, but you can't talk about me.
[02:36:25.840 --> 02:36:27.840]  You're making me not safe.
[02:36:27.840 --> 02:36:29.840]  We're not saying anything violent to them.
[02:36:29.840 --> 02:36:30.840]  It's the entitlement.
[02:36:30.840 --> 02:36:32.840]  I'm going to sue you and destroy you,
[02:36:32.840 --> 02:36:33.840]  and you don't say I'm a bad person.
[02:36:33.840 --> 02:36:34.840]  You take it.
[02:36:34.840 --> 02:36:36.840]  I'm in a safe space.
[02:36:36.840 --> 02:36:37.840]  The entire safe space culture...
[02:36:37.840 --> 02:36:39.840]  Save me, ooh!
[02:36:39.840 --> 02:36:41.840]  The entire safe space culture has embraced that.
[02:36:41.840 --> 02:36:43.840]  So you can have a be a lawyer,
[02:36:43.840 --> 02:36:44.840]  have a different point of view,
[02:36:44.840 --> 02:36:45.840]  a different perspective,
[02:36:45.840 --> 02:36:47.840]  and nobody wants anything bad to happen
[02:36:47.840 --> 02:36:49.840]  to anybody out there, period.
[02:36:49.840 --> 02:36:51.840]  Like I said, that's a big story out right now.
[02:36:51.840 --> 02:36:54.840]  It's like, how dare Alice Jones's lawyer fight back?
[02:36:54.840 --> 02:36:55.840]  It needs to be banned.
[02:36:55.840 --> 02:36:56.840]  Exactly.
[02:36:56.840 --> 02:36:58.840]  Do people think they get oxygen next?
[02:36:58.840 --> 02:36:59.840]  Exactly.
[02:36:59.840 --> 02:37:00.840]  They have Daily Beast and other people out there
[02:37:00.840 --> 02:37:02.840]  promoting the idea that I should not be allowed
[02:37:02.840 --> 02:37:04.840]  to defend you in the public arena.
[02:37:04.840 --> 02:37:05.840]  I should not be allowed to defend you
[02:37:05.840 --> 02:37:06.840]  in the court of public opinion.
[02:37:06.840 --> 02:37:09.840]  I should not be allowed to speak my own state of mind,
[02:37:09.840 --> 02:37:10.840]  my own point of view on this,
[02:37:10.840 --> 02:37:12.840]  because I've been speaking about this...
[02:37:12.840 --> 02:37:14.840]  Well, they run around like rabid dogs attacking us.
[02:37:14.840 --> 02:37:16.840]  Oh, and all kinds of attacks,
[02:37:16.840 --> 02:37:18.840]  attacks of coming all over the place
[02:37:18.840 --> 02:37:19.840]  from the institutional press
[02:37:19.840 --> 02:37:21.840]  and from powerful politicians.
[02:37:21.840 --> 02:37:22.840]  When you appear to someone like Senator Murphy
[02:37:22.840 --> 02:37:24.840]  going on Meet the Press to say,
[02:37:24.840 --> 02:37:26.840]  you should be banned from being ever...
[02:37:26.840 --> 02:37:27.840]  To save America.
[02:37:27.840 --> 02:37:28.840]  Exactly.
[02:37:28.840 --> 02:37:30.840]  Which is, I mean, the degree of double deception there.
[02:37:30.840 --> 02:37:33.840]  You cannot save America by banning anyone's speech.
[02:37:33.840 --> 02:37:35.840]  You kill America by banning anyone's speech.
[02:37:35.840 --> 02:37:38.840]  Let's bring in Raheem Kasam,
[02:37:38.840 --> 02:37:40.840]  great researcher, great journalist.
[02:37:40.840 --> 02:37:42.840]  He's been on the show before at Raheem Kasam
[02:37:42.840 --> 02:37:44.840]  for now on Twitter.
[02:37:44.840 --> 02:37:46.840]  They've relaunched human events.
[02:37:46.840 --> 02:37:49.840]  I was in high school and had my job
[02:37:49.840 --> 02:37:51.840]  at the golf course after hours,
[02:37:51.840 --> 02:37:53.840]  and I remember ordering human events,
[02:37:53.840 --> 02:37:55.840]  and it came, I guess, every week or something
[02:37:55.840 --> 02:37:57.840]  in the mailbox.
[02:37:57.840 --> 02:37:58.840]  But they've relaunched it.
[02:37:58.840 --> 02:37:59.840]  Congratulations on that.
[02:37:59.840 --> 02:38:00.840]  We'll talk about it.
[02:38:00.840 --> 02:38:02.840]  But what do you make of this,
[02:38:02.840 --> 02:38:03.840]  the mass censorship?
[02:38:03.840 --> 02:38:05.840]  Because, again, we have the smoking gun, my friend.
[02:38:05.840 --> 02:38:06.840]  We have a month ago.
[02:38:06.840 --> 02:38:07.840]  I hope you'll write about this.
[02:38:07.840 --> 02:38:08.840]  They were saying,
[02:38:08.840 --> 02:38:09.840]  we studied Joe on something anti-Semitic.
[02:38:09.840 --> 02:38:10.840]  Well, even if it is anti-Semitic,
[02:38:10.840 --> 02:38:12.840]  we have a free speech, but I didn't.
[02:38:12.840 --> 02:38:13.840]  Then they still run with this,
[02:38:13.840 --> 02:38:16.840]  banned Laura Loomer and Milo Unopolis,
[02:38:16.840 --> 02:38:17.840]  who happen to be Jewish,
[02:38:17.840 --> 02:38:20.840]  and me mixing Farrakhan to make it look reasonable,
[02:38:20.840 --> 02:38:22.840]  and then just go ahead with the defamation
[02:38:22.840 --> 02:38:25.840]  and then say, you can't say Alex Jones's name.
[02:38:25.840 --> 02:38:26.840]  What are you, I mean,
[02:38:26.840 --> 02:38:28.840]  maybe this is a simulation.
[02:38:28.840 --> 02:38:31.840]  We're playing the 1984 game on steroids.
[02:38:31.840 --> 02:38:33.840]  I mean, what is this?
[02:38:33.840 --> 02:38:35.840]  You know, whenever people have made
[02:38:35.840 --> 02:38:38.840]  historical comparisons to 1984,
[02:38:38.840 --> 02:38:40.840]  I've typically balked because it tends to be
[02:38:40.840 --> 02:38:41.840]  a little bit trite
[02:38:41.840 --> 02:38:43.840]  and it tends to be a little shoe-horned in.
[02:38:43.840 --> 02:38:44.840]  But the fact of the matter is,
[02:38:44.840 --> 02:38:46.840]  when people are posting pictures,
[02:38:46.840 --> 02:38:49.840]  a picture of you, a picture of Milo,
[02:38:49.840 --> 02:38:51.840]  a picture of Laura, just pictures,
[02:38:51.840 --> 02:38:54.840]  not saying anything to their Instagram accounts,
[02:38:54.840 --> 02:38:57.840]  those pictures are being blurred and removed today.
[02:38:57.840 --> 02:38:58.840]  If that's not the memory hole,
[02:38:58.840 --> 02:39:01.840]  if that's not Winston Smith's memory hole
[02:39:01.840 --> 02:39:03.840]  from all Wells 1984, then I don't know what is.
[02:39:03.840 --> 02:39:04.840]  Well, hold on, hold on.
[02:39:04.840 --> 02:39:05.840]  Tell us about this as a journalist,
[02:39:05.840 --> 02:39:07.840]  because I got thousands, I saw thousands,
[02:39:07.840 --> 02:39:08.840]  hundreds are coming in an hour.
[02:39:08.840 --> 02:39:10.840]  People saying, I try to even say your name,
[02:39:10.840 --> 02:39:11.840]  it's banned.
[02:39:11.840 --> 02:39:12.840]  It's not just on Facebook,
[02:39:12.840 --> 02:39:14.840]  it's happening everywhere on these big platforms.
[02:39:14.840 --> 02:39:17.840]  You're saying they're blurring images of us now.
[02:39:17.840 --> 02:39:19.840]  Yeah, that's absolutely right.
[02:39:19.840 --> 02:39:22.840]  A friend of mine was showing me pictures earlier
[02:39:22.840 --> 02:39:24.840]  where she was trying to post pictures
[02:39:24.840 --> 02:39:27.840]  of her friends with you guys,
[02:39:27.840 --> 02:39:29.840]  whether it was in the Trump Hotel in Washington, D.C.
[02:39:29.840 --> 02:39:31.840]  or CPAC or whatever it was,
[02:39:31.840 --> 02:39:33.840]  and the pictures were being blurred and removed
[02:39:33.840 --> 02:39:35.840]  and they were getting a notification that said,
[02:39:35.840 --> 02:39:37.840]  this has to come down off your page now
[02:39:37.840 --> 02:39:38.840]  or you'll be banned as well.
[02:39:38.840 --> 02:39:41.840]  Wow, so even people that take a picture in public,
[02:39:41.840 --> 02:39:44.840]  that, oh my God, wow.
[02:39:44.840 --> 02:39:46.840]  And Trump doesn't take action on that.
[02:39:46.840 --> 02:39:49.840]  A private citizen can't put up a, wow.
[02:39:49.840 --> 02:39:50.840]  There it is.
[02:39:50.840 --> 02:39:53.840]  And that's what you've got on the screen there now.
[02:39:53.840 --> 02:39:55.840]  It's exactly what I'm talking about.
[02:39:55.840 --> 02:39:58.840]  This is now gone from the position
[02:39:58.840 --> 02:40:01.840]  of these Boomer conservatives saying,
[02:40:01.840 --> 02:40:03.840]  oh yeah, but these are private platforms.
[02:40:03.840 --> 02:40:04.840]  They can do whatever they want.
[02:40:04.840 --> 02:40:07.840]  What they're actually doing now is erasing you people.
[02:40:07.840 --> 02:40:09.840]  They are trying to erase all of us.
[02:40:09.840 --> 02:40:12.840]  This is the Soviet airbrush and it shows the surveillance
[02:40:12.840 --> 02:40:13.840]  that's going on.
[02:40:13.840 --> 02:40:16.840]  Like they're surveilling everything you do.
[02:40:16.840 --> 02:40:17.840]  And it's not algorithmic.
[02:40:17.840 --> 02:40:18.840]  It cannot be algorithmic.
[02:40:18.840 --> 02:40:21.840]  So you know there are armies of people in there now
[02:40:21.840 --> 02:40:24.840]  looking for your face, Alex, on the internet
[02:40:24.840 --> 02:40:26.840]  in order so they can censor you.
[02:40:26.840 --> 02:40:27.840]  Wow.
[02:40:27.840 --> 02:40:28.840]  Facebook.
[02:40:28.840 --> 02:40:30.840]  I got an email from Facebook yesterday saying,
[02:40:30.840 --> 02:40:33.840]  we looked through your page and this post from 11 years ago
[02:40:33.840 --> 02:40:34.840]  constitute hate speech.
[02:40:34.840 --> 02:40:37.840]  Well, no algorithms picking up something from 11 years ago.
[02:40:37.840 --> 02:40:40.840]  That means somebody is sitting there scrolling through my page
[02:40:40.840 --> 02:40:41.840]  11 years ago.
[02:40:41.840 --> 02:40:43.840]  How many people have they hired?
[02:40:43.840 --> 02:40:46.840]  I heard it's 70,000 between the four companies.
[02:40:46.840 --> 02:40:49.840]  Yeah, it's much more than that.
[02:40:49.840 --> 02:40:52.840]  It's going to be 70,000 here in the United States.
[02:40:52.840 --> 02:40:54.840]  You're going to have many, many more people across Europe.
[02:40:54.840 --> 02:40:56.840]  And of course, don't forget they've got all the bureaucrats
[02:40:56.840 --> 02:40:58.840]  and apparatchiks in the European Union
[02:40:58.840 --> 02:40:59.840]  helping them with all of this as well.
[02:40:59.840 --> 02:41:01.840]  This is a state corporate nexus.
[02:41:01.840 --> 02:41:03.840]  And I have to say, if President Trump doesn't do something
[02:41:03.840 --> 02:41:06.840]  about this, this will be his greatest failure as president.
[02:41:06.840 --> 02:41:09.840]  This is his supporters that are coming under attack daily,
[02:41:09.840 --> 02:41:13.840]  routinely. And it's not just so that you can't make as much money
[02:41:13.840 --> 02:41:14.840]  as you were making before, Alex,
[02:41:14.840 --> 02:41:16.840]  or that I can't monetize my platforms.
[02:41:16.840 --> 02:41:18.840]  This is about erasing us from existence.
[02:41:18.840 --> 02:41:20.840]  Wow, it's not just my face.
[02:41:20.840 --> 02:41:22.840]  Now my image.
[02:41:22.840 --> 02:41:24.840]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:41:24.840 --> 02:41:26.840]  Your name, image, nothing that's kind of,
[02:41:26.840 --> 02:41:28.840]  it's like you're being unpersoned.
[02:41:28.840 --> 02:41:30.840]  And then completely, it is the memory hole that we're even
[02:41:30.840 --> 02:41:31.840]  talking about.
[02:41:31.840 --> 02:41:32.840]  Stick a fork in me.
[02:41:32.840 --> 02:41:34.840]  I'm not giving up at this point.
[02:41:34.840 --> 02:41:36.840]  I'm just like, I can't believe Raheem that they found
[02:41:36.840 --> 02:41:37.840]  this many evil people.
[02:41:37.840 --> 02:41:40.840]  Like, what the hell happened here?
[02:41:40.840 --> 02:41:44.840]  Well, I suspect Facebook, especially,
[02:41:44.840 --> 02:41:47.840]  knows that fewer and fewer people are losing its platform.
[02:41:47.840 --> 02:41:50.840]  And what do you do when you're trying to hold onto something
[02:41:50.840 --> 02:41:51.840]  in the palm of your hand?
[02:41:51.840 --> 02:41:52.840]  You hold it up like this.
[02:41:52.840 --> 02:41:54.840]  But if you feel like you're losing grip,
[02:41:54.840 --> 02:41:56.840]  you clutch your fist around like that.
[02:41:56.840 --> 02:41:58.840]  What they're doing is they're losing the grains of sand
[02:41:58.840 --> 02:42:00.840]  between their fingertips.
[02:42:00.840 --> 02:42:02.840]  And they know more and more that they're losing power.
[02:42:02.840 --> 02:42:04.840]  And so that's why, like, a wounded animal,
[02:42:04.840 --> 02:42:06.840]  they're lacking out now.
[02:42:06.840 --> 02:42:07.840]  Well, you're a smart guy.
[02:42:07.840 --> 02:42:09.840]  I know when you came in before we got to get you on routinely.
[02:42:09.840 --> 02:42:10.840]  I'm glad you relaunched human events.
[02:42:10.840 --> 02:42:12.840]  We'll do a few more segments with you and Bob.
[02:42:12.840 --> 02:42:13.840]  And then I was taking over.
[02:42:13.840 --> 02:42:14.840]  We keep riding shotguns.
[02:42:14.840 --> 02:42:15.840]  It's fine.
[02:42:15.840 --> 02:42:16.840]  I got to take my younger daughter or the doctor with a
[02:42:16.840 --> 02:42:17.840]  middle daughter.
[02:42:17.840 --> 02:42:18.840]  So I got to leave.
[02:42:18.840 --> 02:42:19.840]  I'm coming back today.
[02:42:19.840 --> 02:42:20.840]  We're going to do a lot today.
[02:42:20.840 --> 02:42:24.840]  But it's just, I'm not even freaked out anymore.
[02:42:24.840 --> 02:42:26.840]  I'm like in a Twilight Zone episode.
[02:42:26.840 --> 02:42:27.840]  I've never felt like this.
[02:42:27.840 --> 02:42:30.840]  It's just like, and then he, and there will tell me,
[02:42:30.840 --> 02:42:31.840]  oh, you don't know what's all the news.
[02:42:31.840 --> 02:42:32.840]  They're banning your picture.
[02:42:32.840 --> 02:42:33.840]  I mean, literally.
[02:42:33.840 --> 02:42:34.840]  My image?
[02:42:34.840 --> 02:42:36.840]  It's living on 1984 in real time.
[02:42:36.840 --> 02:42:37.840]  It's really beyond 1984.
[02:42:37.840 --> 02:42:38.840]  It's a sequel.
[02:42:38.840 --> 02:42:39.840]  And it involves things that even,
[02:42:39.840 --> 02:42:41.840]  or we'll never predicted or forecast.
[02:42:41.840 --> 02:42:43.840]  I mean, aspects of this are extraordinary.
[02:42:43.840 --> 02:42:45.840]  Let me ask both of you as we come back.
[02:42:45.840 --> 02:42:47.840]  What do they got next in store?
[02:42:47.840 --> 02:42:49.840]  Because you know they got something more.
[02:42:49.840 --> 02:42:51.840]  I guess it's like arresting us and killing us or something.
[02:42:51.840 --> 02:42:54.840]  I mean, like, well, it just don't exist.
[02:42:54.840 --> 02:42:55.840]  Yeah.
[02:42:55.840 --> 02:43:05.840]  And this is a top tier new tropic focus, clarity, energy,
[02:43:05.840 --> 02:43:07.840]  but instead of having a seven times markup,
[02:43:07.840 --> 02:43:08.840]  we have a hundred and fifty percent markup.
[02:43:08.840 --> 02:43:10.840]  Right now, it's massively discounted.
[02:43:10.840 --> 02:43:13.840]  And when you get a bottle of it, at 25% off,
[02:43:13.840 --> 02:43:16.840]  you get a free bottle of what is our total best seller.
[02:43:16.840 --> 02:43:19.840]  It's not very profitable because we give it at such a low price,
[02:43:19.840 --> 02:43:20.840]  but it's amazing.
[02:43:20.840 --> 02:43:23.840]  And that of course, he's knocked out the ultimate sleep aid.
[02:43:23.840 --> 02:43:26.840]  So we've got a way to energize you, ramp you up in a healthy way
[02:43:26.840 --> 02:43:29.840]  during the day and put you deep into that restful, healthy sleep
[02:43:29.840 --> 02:43:30.840]  at night.
[02:43:30.840 --> 02:43:33.840]  It's the Brain Force and Knockout Combo Deal.
[02:43:33.840 --> 02:43:37.840]  25% off Brain Force and a free bottle of Knockout together

[02:44:20.840 --> 02:44:22.840]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[02:44:22.840 --> 02:44:26.840]  They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[02:44:26.840 --> 02:44:28.840]  And that's why the globalist, Hillary and others,
[02:44:28.840 --> 02:44:30.840]  are trying to shut M4Wars down.
[02:44:30.840 --> 02:44:33.840]  This is a fight about taking your speech away,
[02:44:33.840 --> 02:44:37.840]  not just my speech, about taking your very sovereignty away.
[02:44:37.840 --> 02:44:39.840]  This country is in a war.
[02:44:39.840 --> 02:44:41.840]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done,
[02:44:41.840 --> 02:44:44.840]  but I want to remind you, if you don't spread the articles and videos
[02:44:44.840 --> 02:44:47.840]  and if you don't financially get the great products we have and fund us
[02:44:47.840 --> 02:44:49.840]  in the 360 wind, we're getting the water.
[02:44:49.840 --> 02:44:51.840]  I'm in your hands. You're in my hands.
[02:44:51.840 --> 02:44:54.840]  M4WarsStore.com. Thank you.
[02:44:55.840 --> 02:44:59.840]  I want to salute and commend every man, woman and child
[02:44:59.840 --> 02:45:01.840]  that has supported this broadcast over the years
[02:45:01.840 --> 02:45:03.840]  and that has stood with us.
[02:45:03.840 --> 02:45:06.840]  And I want to thank all of our sponsors and all of our affiliates.
[02:45:06.840 --> 02:45:08.840]  But I'll tell you like it is.
[02:45:08.840 --> 02:45:10.840]  You've seen the unmitigated attack we've been under.
[02:45:10.840 --> 02:45:12.840]  You're our only sponsors.
[02:45:12.840 --> 02:45:16.840]  And when you don't buy the products, they're absolutely the best out there.
[02:45:16.840 --> 02:45:18.840]  We aren't able to continue on.
[02:45:18.840 --> 02:45:21.840]  So remember, you are the info war.
[02:45:21.840 --> 02:45:23.840]  I'm not the leader. You are the leader.
[02:45:23.840 --> 02:45:25.840]  When you take action, nothing stops you.
[02:45:25.840 --> 02:45:28.840]  We've got giant specials running right now at M4WarsStore.com
[02:45:28.840 --> 02:45:30.840]  that are unprecedented.
[02:45:30.840 --> 02:45:33.840]  And if you go there and buy great products that you already need
[02:45:33.840 --> 02:45:35.840]  from across the board,
[02:45:35.840 --> 02:45:38.840]  it funds the second American Revolution worldwide.
[02:45:38.840 --> 02:45:40.840]  So I want to thank you for your support.
[02:45:40.840 --> 02:45:42.840]  I want to encourage you again.
[02:45:42.840 --> 02:45:46.840]  M4WarsStore.com for whatever the product is you need.
[02:45:46.840 --> 02:45:49.840]  We have thousands of them and it makes this all possible.
[02:45:49.840 --> 02:45:51.840]  Thank you for making M4Wars possible.
[02:45:51.840 --> 02:46:13.840]  God bless you.
[02:46:21.840 --> 02:46:25.840]  Happy's can be an important part of your daily supplement routine.
[02:46:25.840 --> 02:46:28.840]  With poor diet and the constant on and off of your work life,
[02:46:28.840 --> 02:46:33.840]  it's more important than ever to support your body in the fight against stress.
[02:46:33.840 --> 02:46:38.840]  With powerful ingredients combined to help support the mind and body,
[02:46:38.840 --> 02:46:42.840]  Happy's helps support during stress, promotes overall well-being,

[02:46:50.840 --> 02:46:54.840]  With Happy's from M4WarsStore.com.
[02:47:20.840 --> 02:47:24.840]  This has been re-launched by Raheem Kossam and others at NDC.
[02:47:24.840 --> 02:47:27.840]  Robert Barnes is driving a shotgun while this is going to the next hour.
[02:47:27.840 --> 02:47:29.840]  We've got Owen Schwerer coming in here.
[02:47:29.840 --> 02:47:31.840]  I'm taking my middle daughter to the doctor.
[02:47:31.840 --> 02:47:35.840]  Even though the media says that I had my children taken two years ago,
[02:47:35.840 --> 02:47:37.840]  I had my children 90% of the time.
[02:47:37.840 --> 02:47:38.840]  I had primary custody.
[02:47:38.840 --> 02:47:39.840]  It doesn't matter.
[02:47:39.840 --> 02:47:40.840]  They just said I'd have my children.
[02:47:40.840 --> 02:47:41.840]  People go on the street.
[02:47:41.840 --> 02:47:42.840]  Ask you, you don't have your kids.
[02:47:42.840 --> 02:47:45.840]  I'll be on airplanes with my kids coming back from a ski resort or wherever.
[02:47:45.840 --> 02:47:48.840]  They go, ask you and your family and you don't have your kids.
[02:47:48.840 --> 02:47:52.840]  And I'm like, okay, again, it's just all this fake news that we're this incompetence.
[02:47:52.840 --> 02:47:53.840]  We're failing.
[02:47:53.840 --> 02:47:54.840]  They're winning.
[02:47:54.840 --> 02:47:56.840]  No, the globalists are losing.
[02:47:56.840 --> 02:47:58.840]  I think we're winning.
[02:47:58.840 --> 02:48:01.840]  But I don't want to even just bash Trump for no reason,
[02:48:01.840 --> 02:48:06.840]  but the censorship, the racketeering, the coordination of it.
[02:48:06.840 --> 02:48:08.840]  Now they're now saying you can't say somebody's name
[02:48:08.840 --> 02:48:10.840]  and we're surveilling you in a live time.
[02:48:10.840 --> 02:48:13.840]  Raheem, you're a smart cookie.
[02:48:13.840 --> 02:48:14.840]  You're up there in D.C.
[02:48:14.840 --> 02:48:16.840]  What do you think is going on currently?
[02:48:16.840 --> 02:48:19.840]  Do you think this is going to go if Trump doesn't take action?
[02:48:19.840 --> 02:48:21.840]  And what action do you think Trump should take?
[02:48:21.840 --> 02:48:24.840]  Look, here's why I think they've done it to you guys now,
[02:48:24.840 --> 02:48:29.840]  because you've been the tip of the spear in terms of not just the support for President Trump,
[02:48:29.840 --> 02:48:31.840]  but your support for constitutional principles,
[02:48:31.840 --> 02:48:35.840]  support for libertarian, conservative, nationalist principles,
[02:48:35.840 --> 02:48:37.840]  all of those over the course of the years.
[02:48:37.840 --> 02:48:41.840]  You, Laura, Milo, Paul Joseph Watson, everybody who's been banned yesterday.
[02:48:41.840 --> 02:48:44.840]  And here's why I think they did it to you guys first,
[02:48:44.840 --> 02:48:47.840]  because actually they want to come after more mainstream conservatives,
[02:48:47.840 --> 02:48:51.840]  but they know that they have to shift the Overton window a little bit in order to go after that.
[02:48:51.840 --> 02:48:53.840]  And make it look like it's Farrakhan, exactly.
[02:48:53.840 --> 02:48:56.840]  It's Farrakhan, and then us, and Drudge has the articles link
[02:48:56.840 --> 02:49:01.840]  where Southern Prairie Law Center is listing hundreds of sites, including you, they want banned.
[02:49:01.840 --> 02:49:06.840]  Yeah, and for the, and, you know, people like myself and Jack Posobick are next,
[02:49:06.840 --> 02:49:09.840]  but the people who are actually complaining that we're complaining,
[02:49:09.840 --> 02:49:11.840]  i.e. the Ben Shapiro's of the world,
[02:49:11.840 --> 02:49:14.840]  they're next after that, and they don't realize it.
[02:49:14.840 --> 02:49:16.840]  Bingo, I'm interrupting because you're so on target.
[02:49:16.840 --> 02:49:17.840]  I should have opened the show with that.
[02:49:17.840 --> 02:49:19.840]  The way they trick conservatives to go,
[02:49:19.840 --> 02:49:22.840]  I'm glad Farrakhan, nobody's listening to Farrakhan on the internet.
[02:49:22.840 --> 02:49:24.840]  He's got his people, and that's it.
[02:49:24.840 --> 02:49:27.840]  So the idea, well, I'm glad you're finally getting them censored too.
[02:49:27.840 --> 02:49:31.840]  We just bought into it when it's going to be mainline conservatives that are real targets.
[02:49:31.840 --> 02:49:33.840]  So I'm interrupting, but yeah, restart.
[02:49:33.840 --> 02:49:35.840]  What you're saying is the smartest thing we've said all day.
[02:49:35.840 --> 02:49:36.840]  That's exactly it.
[02:49:36.840 --> 02:49:41.840]  This is the Trojan horse, the conservatives to accept the total collapse.
[02:49:41.840 --> 02:49:42.840]  That's right.
[02:49:42.840 --> 02:49:47.840]  And it pains me greatly that there are these sort of mainstream establishment Republicans
[02:49:47.840 --> 02:49:51.840]  going, oh, my free market, my free market, these companies can do what they want.
[02:49:51.840 --> 02:49:52.840]  The fact is there is no difference.
[02:49:52.840 --> 02:49:56.840]  There is no distinction between the digital space and the public space nowadays.
[02:49:56.840 --> 02:49:59.840]  You know, you go outside and if I start shouting in the middle of a public square,
[02:49:59.840 --> 02:50:03.840]  you can bet your bottom dollar somebody's going to throw on Instagram or throw on Periscope
[02:50:03.840 --> 02:50:04.840]  and start live streaming it.
[02:50:04.840 --> 02:50:05.840]  That's the world we live in now.
[02:50:05.840 --> 02:50:08.840]  Those are the terms we accepted with modernity and that's just fine.
[02:50:08.840 --> 02:50:12.840]  The terms we didn't accept, however, are that there are these faceless corporations.
[02:50:12.840 --> 02:50:15.840]  And by most regards, they are faceless.
[02:50:15.840 --> 02:50:18.840]  You know, Mark Zuckerberg is not the be all and end all of Facebook.
[02:50:18.840 --> 02:50:22.840]  It is an army of people that they have there, an army of enforcers that they have in there.
[02:50:22.840 --> 02:50:25.840]  This lady who emailed me yesterday telling me that I wasn't allowed to say something
[02:50:25.840 --> 02:50:29.840]  11 years ago because it offended a protected class of people.
[02:50:29.840 --> 02:50:35.840]  Look, the fact is I'm afraid that for anybody who ostensibly is on our side,
[02:50:35.840 --> 02:50:39.840]  i.e. you believe in the Constitution, you believe in conservatism, you believe in small government,
[02:50:39.840 --> 02:50:40.840]  all of those things.
[02:50:40.840 --> 02:50:45.840]  If you are now making excuses for Facebook, then you're going to be banned next and don't blame me
[02:50:45.840 --> 02:50:48.840]  for dancing on your digital grave when it happens.
[02:50:48.840 --> 02:50:52.840]  I have no reason to feel sorry for you in that regard when that happens to you.
[02:50:52.840 --> 02:50:58.840]  Alex, look, we have a real crisis situation now because it's not about just what's going on
[02:50:58.840 --> 02:50:59.840]  to you.
[02:50:59.840 --> 02:51:04.840]  This is about the greatest country this world has ever seen is being assailed.
[02:51:04.840 --> 02:51:05.840]  It's principled.
[02:51:05.840 --> 02:51:10.840]  It's falling to a bunch of control freaks that trick people to get into their digital lives
[02:51:10.840 --> 02:51:15.840]  and are now spying and using it against us with an army of SJWs training universities
[02:51:15.840 --> 02:51:19.840]  engaging in stasi level crimes to the next pay.
[02:51:19.840 --> 02:51:20.840]  And I agree.
[02:51:20.840 --> 02:51:21.840]  It's not about me.
[02:51:21.840 --> 02:51:22.840]  I'm flamboyant.
[02:51:22.840 --> 02:51:23.840]  They've demonized me.
[02:51:23.840 --> 02:51:24.840]  They've built a straw man.
[02:51:24.840 --> 02:51:29.840]  They're using me as the demon to destroy everybody else's freedom.
[02:51:29.840 --> 02:51:30.840]  I'm saying this.
[02:51:30.840 --> 02:51:31.840]  I am not the issue, people.
[02:51:31.840 --> 02:51:36.840]  In fact, at the end of the day, I'll probably get bigger, but there'll be no country left
[02:51:36.840 --> 02:51:39.840]  to stop it, stop it, people.
[02:51:39.840 --> 02:51:40.840]  Right.
[02:51:40.840 --> 02:51:41.840]  That's exactly right, Alex.
[02:51:41.840 --> 02:51:42.840]  So what do we do?
[02:51:42.840 --> 02:51:43.840]  What do we do?
[02:51:43.840 --> 02:51:48.840]  Well, first things first, I think we have to now organize en masse.
[02:51:48.840 --> 02:51:52.840]  We have to, all of us come together in the same place at the same time.
[02:51:52.840 --> 02:51:57.760]  You know, it's no good Laura Luma just being herself outside Jack Dorsey's house.
[02:51:57.760 --> 02:51:58.840]  We all need to be doing that.
[02:51:58.840 --> 02:52:02.840]  We're going to go back to old school public protests and make sure that the news...
[02:52:02.840 --> 02:52:03.840]  Hey, right.
[02:52:03.840 --> 02:52:04.840]  She's like Spartacus.
[02:52:04.840 --> 02:52:05.840]  Everybody's got to be Spartacus.
[02:52:05.840 --> 02:52:08.840]  Everybody must be Spartacus at this point, and all credit to her for sticking her neck
[02:52:08.840 --> 02:52:10.840]  out and doing this way before anybody else was.
[02:52:10.840 --> 02:52:12.840]  I think we all need to start following in her footsteps.
[02:52:12.840 --> 02:52:17.320]  The other thing we need to do is stop electing these crappy conservatives who don't actually
[02:52:17.320 --> 02:52:20.440]  believe in defending their own people that vote for them, okay?
[02:52:20.440 --> 02:52:23.880]  And if President Trump wants to put himself amongst those people, then so be it.
[02:52:23.880 --> 02:52:25.440]  He needs to act on this as well.
[02:52:25.440 --> 02:52:28.920]  Robert will tell you from a legal perspective, there are many avenues we can pursue here.
[02:52:28.920 --> 02:52:31.680]  From a legislative perspective, there are a lot of avenues we can have here.
[02:52:31.680 --> 02:52:36.480]  I know you have a big audience and you have very, very, you know, people who are willing
[02:52:36.480 --> 02:52:38.920]  to fund fights like this going ahead right now.
[02:52:38.920 --> 02:52:45.240]  We need to build our own sort of platform whereby we can one click let everybody in
[02:52:45.240 --> 02:52:47.440]  that Congress know who's ostensibly on our side.
[02:52:47.440 --> 02:52:49.440]  We need our own sleeping giants.
[02:52:49.440 --> 02:52:52.440]  We need our own database of folks ready to go to war.
[02:52:52.440 --> 02:52:53.440]  Oh, precisely.
[02:52:53.440 --> 02:52:55.160]  What it needs to be is sort of coordinated collective action.
[02:52:55.160 --> 02:52:57.640]  I mean, it's great that human events is restarting.
[02:52:57.640 --> 02:53:03.360]  Will Chamberlain, who works also with Raheem, went into detail about how basically there
[02:53:03.360 --> 02:53:08.320]  needs to be a civil right access to digital public square.
[02:53:08.320 --> 02:53:11.200]  And particularly when these big companies have chosen to be monopolies, this is what
[02:53:11.200 --> 02:53:12.640]  I've explained to other people.
[02:53:12.640 --> 02:53:14.560]  That's what makes them different than the ordinary free market.
[02:53:14.560 --> 02:53:16.840]  This isn't some little guy competing on the street corner.
[02:53:16.840 --> 02:53:19.560]  This is a big giant that's decided to be a monopoly.
[02:53:19.560 --> 02:53:23.040]  With a monopoly comes obligations, particularly when you decide to monopolize the public
[02:53:23.040 --> 02:53:24.040]  square.
[02:53:24.040 --> 02:53:26.040]  And when you advertise that you're open and free, but you're not, we're going to have
[02:53:26.040 --> 02:53:27.040]  you finish up next hour.
[02:53:27.040 --> 02:53:30.880]  You're going to go host with Owen when I'm when I go meet with my imaginary children
[02:53:30.880 --> 02:53:31.880]  in the media.
[02:53:31.880 --> 02:53:32.880]  So we're taking away.
[02:53:32.880 --> 02:53:36.240]  But Raheem, because I've heard from Bob, he's a smart guy.
[02:53:36.240 --> 02:53:38.800]  What do you think the solutions are Trump needs to do?
[02:53:38.800 --> 02:53:43.640]  But other than that, obviously the ace of spades is Trump needs to do something on this.
[02:53:43.640 --> 02:53:47.960]  This is racketeering, this is criminal section 230 violation, election meddling.
[02:53:47.960 --> 02:53:52.040]  I mean, I like Trump on a bunch of other issues, but man, I, I got to be honest.
[02:53:52.040 --> 02:53:56.120]  I mean, it's like, is he, he's not this stupid show.
[02:53:56.120 --> 02:53:57.120]  What's really going on?
[02:53:57.120 --> 02:54:01.320]  Are they behind the scenes battling over who gets control of the NSA system?
[02:54:01.320 --> 02:54:03.440]  Because that's what this really is.
[02:54:03.440 --> 02:54:05.960]  You know, I couldn't tell you what's going on in the president's mind at the moment.
[02:54:05.960 --> 02:54:09.840]  I certainly hope he's not just being distracted by trying to run Venezuela instead of running
[02:54:09.840 --> 02:54:11.240]  the United States right now.
[02:54:11.240 --> 02:54:13.200]  I hope that's not the case.
[02:54:13.200 --> 02:54:18.240]  For me, if I were him right now, I would assemble and immediately assemble an executive task
[02:54:18.240 --> 02:54:22.400]  force to look into this, report back to the White House within a month with its findings,
[02:54:22.400 --> 02:54:26.640]  and then you put together in, on Capitol Hill, a group of legislators who are willing to
[02:54:26.640 --> 02:54:32.040]  draft the legislation to redraft the communications decency act, section 230 of the communications
[02:54:32.040 --> 02:54:36.160]  decency act, strip these platforms of their protections under the law, whereby they can't
[02:54:36.160 --> 02:54:40.800]  be sued by ordinary people for the actions that are being taken against them.
[02:54:40.800 --> 02:54:46.040]  And at that point, you've got not just the, you know, the moral right on your side.
[02:54:46.040 --> 02:54:50.720]  You actually have a pretty good campaign platform for going into the next election.
[02:54:50.720 --> 02:54:54.080]  It is ordinary people versus the would-be masters of the universe.
[02:54:54.080 --> 02:54:56.320]  And that's what the 2020 election is going to be about.
[02:54:56.320 --> 02:54:59.040]  It's back to the old deplorables mantra and mindset.
[02:54:59.040 --> 02:55:00.400]  I totally agree.
[02:55:00.400 --> 02:55:04.400]  And it's a unifying thing, even on some of the left, to get behind free speech.
[02:55:04.400 --> 02:55:08.120]  And Trump's looking for that perfect thing to fix it.
[02:55:08.120 --> 02:55:10.680]  All he's got to do is tell big tech, I know what you're doing.
[02:55:10.680 --> 02:55:14.320]  I know Clinton and Obama stay behind networks, have you doing this?
[02:55:14.320 --> 02:55:15.320]  Stop it.
[02:55:15.320 --> 02:55:18.720]  And they would stop it if he just said, I'm coming after you.
[02:55:18.720 --> 02:55:24.040]  But the vacuum of him not doing it, instead China and the EU are creating the regulations
[02:55:24.040 --> 02:55:25.520]  for the architecture of the internet.
[02:55:25.520 --> 02:55:29.680]  So by Trump doing nothing, he's done everything he's handed control over.
[02:55:29.680 --> 02:55:30.680]  No doubt.
[02:55:30.680 --> 02:55:32.000]  I mean, he's got to take action.
[02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:33.000]  Go ahead, Ray.
[02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:35.440]  No, I was going to say that's exactly right.
[02:55:35.440 --> 02:55:42.640]  And even when we relaunched human events earlier this week, we knew that if we try to make
[02:55:42.640 --> 02:55:46.480]  money through advertising or anything like that, it's just not going to happen.
[02:55:46.480 --> 02:55:50.440]  So instead, we set up a membership way of doing things where people can actually join
[02:55:50.440 --> 02:55:54.240]  us and contribute to us and know that they're helping keeping us online and I know they
[02:55:54.240 --> 02:55:55.240]  do the same thing.
[02:55:55.240 --> 02:55:56.440]  Your audience does the same thing with you.
[02:55:56.440 --> 02:55:58.040]  And kudos to those people.
[02:55:58.040 --> 02:56:00.440]  Let me give you one last warning about this.
[02:56:00.440 --> 02:56:05.040]  For everyone out there who is complaining about this, but isn't willing to support the
[02:56:05.040 --> 02:56:10.240]  likes of you and Laura and Milo and me and Will, whoever's complaining and isn't supporting
[02:56:10.240 --> 02:56:12.560]  conservative media, you're part of the problem.
[02:56:12.560 --> 02:56:13.560]  You're insane.
[02:56:13.560 --> 02:56:14.560]  You're not allowed to complain anymore.
[02:56:14.560 --> 02:56:15.560]  You're insane.
[02:56:15.560 --> 02:56:16.720]  They're clearly coming after you.
[02:56:16.720 --> 02:56:21.200]  We're just the big dogs up front barking because we instinctively are defending freedom.
[02:56:21.200 --> 02:56:23.560]  Once they've wiped us out, folks, you're done.
[02:56:23.560 --> 02:56:24.720]  Oh, no doubt about it.
[02:56:24.720 --> 02:56:29.520]  I mean, I'm one of the founding people involved in supporting human events does great work.
[02:56:29.520 --> 02:56:32.880]  But if people don't coordinate action and don't support the legal action that you're
[02:56:32.880 --> 02:56:35.840]  taking that other people are taking, then what's going to happen is they're going to
[02:56:35.840 --> 02:56:37.640]  be able to shut down and silence everybody.
[02:56:37.640 --> 02:56:38.640]  I agree.
[02:56:38.640 --> 02:56:39.640]  Let's cover when we come back.
[02:56:39.640 --> 02:56:43.240]  Raheem, please come back and talk about the big cover stories about the new top of
[02:56:43.240 --> 02:56:46.200]  one of the Democrats are trying to run with this division politics.
[02:56:46.200 --> 02:56:47.360]  So please join us next week.
[02:56:47.360 --> 02:56:48.360]  God bless you.
[02:56:48.360 --> 02:56:49.360]  Thanks for the time.
[02:56:49.360 --> 02:56:50.360]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:56:50.360 --> 02:56:51.360]  Bob, you'll have the floor.
[02:56:51.360 --> 02:56:52.360]  You're a machine.
[02:56:52.360 --> 02:56:53.360]  I'm going to take a drink of water.
[02:56:53.360 --> 02:56:54.360]  You go to the bathroom.
[02:56:54.360 --> 02:56:55.360]  You want to host the next hour, though, and you're doing it.
[02:56:55.360 --> 02:57:00.000]  I'm going to take one of my imaginary children on of custody of to the doctor.
[02:57:00.000 --> 02:57:01.360]  She's getting a checkup to go back to school.
[02:57:01.360 --> 02:57:02.360]  She got a cold, whatever.
[02:57:02.360 --> 02:57:04.360]  We're going to do that in 30 seconds.
[02:57:04.360 --> 02:57:07.600]  I'm doing this info or store.com info or store.com.
[02:57:07.600 --> 02:57:11.200]  The best fish oil, the best turmeric, the best iodine, the best products, a bunch of
[02:57:11.200 --> 02:57:12.200]  specials are about to end.
[02:57:12.200 --> 02:57:17.880]  Hard to live a week already went by a free bottle of X three nascent tri iodine.
[02:57:17.880 --> 02:57:18.880]  It's amazing.
[02:57:18.880 --> 02:57:23.640]  Once you see how good it is, a free bottle of when you get X two and the X twos 25%
[02:57:23.640 --> 02:57:24.640]  off.

[02:59:49.220 --> 03:00:05.140]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:05.140 --> 03:00:12.100]  Okay, coming up, we've got a Mark Dice report. We haven't aired yet. It's extremely informative.
[03:00:12.100 --> 03:00:23.460]  Let's just say that. Everything on this show is powerful. Plus, they're powerful. It is
[03:00:23.460 --> 03:00:47.340]  so powerful. Welcome back, folks. We are the Godzilla of News and Information, the T-Rex
[03:00:47.340 --> 03:01:00.780]  of Political Talk. They say he's got to go. Alex Jones. Oh, they say he's got to go.
[03:01:00.780 --> 03:01:06.580]  There goes your new world order. All right, I'm going to stop having some fun with this.
[03:01:06.580 --> 03:01:11.740]  We got the report coming up, and then Barnes and Owen Schroder will be in here together.
[03:01:11.740 --> 03:01:15.220]  I am taking my daughter to the doctor. I'll have to go to the medical appointment, see
[03:01:15.220 --> 03:01:19.140]  if we know it's no big deal. And then I'm going to come back up here tonight. I'll be
[03:01:19.140 --> 03:01:23.820]  back up here in the saddle. I'm going on Newsmax TV. I'm going on Gavin McGinnis' show. I'm
[03:01:23.820 --> 03:01:29.180]  doing some other shows. And I just, I think a little pixie told me, a little sprite told
[03:01:29.180 --> 03:01:34.620]  me, we'll probably do a live show tonight. So look for that coming up in the war rooms
[03:01:34.620 --> 03:01:40.100]  at 3 o'clock. But I just want to say something about DrudgeReport.com. I mean, I never asked
[03:01:40.100 --> 03:01:47.100]  Drudge to link to our stories unless we're in an emergency. And it's just so good because
[03:01:47.100 --> 03:01:50.740]  we'll do the regular show, a couple million tune in and hundreds of thousands watch the
[03:01:50.740 --> 03:01:56.860]  streams but over the day. But when Drudge links to it, sometimes it's millions, sometimes
[03:01:56.860 --> 03:02:02.180]  even 14, 15 million. And so it just feels good to know there's a place out there like
[03:02:02.180 --> 03:02:09.020]  DrudgeReport.com that isn't under intimidation, isn't under their control. I mean, look at
[03:02:09.020 --> 03:02:14.300]  this link banning latest censorship tool. Journalism Institute tries to blacklist conservative
[03:02:14.300 --> 03:02:19.260]  outlets as un-news. This fake news got put back by the president on them. So now it's
[03:02:19.260 --> 03:02:26.100]  false news and un-news. There's an old backlash article. People are seeing right through this
[03:02:26.100 --> 03:02:32.700]  the elitism of telling you what you can visit and what you can do and what you can read.
[03:02:32.700 --> 03:02:38.580]  Again, I'll never forget. I was like 14. I'd read a bunch of books on World War II. Thought
[03:02:38.580 --> 03:02:42.460]  they were really interesting that my parents had. So I went to the local bookstore back
[03:02:42.460 --> 03:02:46.340]  when the mall had little bookstores that, you know, and I go in and I get mine comp. It
[03:02:46.340 --> 03:02:51.740]  was a big orange copy. My struggle. Unreadable gibberish once I got it. I was reading like
[03:02:51.740 --> 03:02:56.660]  old man in the sea and for him the bell tolls and all this other stuff. I was beautiful
[03:02:56.660 --> 03:03:01.660]  literature. I was reading the Odyssey. I read Hitler's book. I was like, this is crap. But
[03:03:01.660 --> 03:03:06.260]  regardless, the woman asked me because I was blonde or blue. I don't know. Are you a Nazi?
[03:03:06.260 --> 03:03:12.900]  And I said, are you? Are you a Nazi? Shelling this book? You idiot. I was 14. White years
[03:03:12.900 --> 03:03:22.900]  smarter than her. I've read Das Kapital written by Karl Marx and Engels. So boy, you know,
[03:03:22.900 --> 03:03:30.380]  that was a bunch of crap too. So there's this mindset where if you read something, you're
[03:03:30.380 --> 03:03:36.500]  what you read. Or if I look at something, I become that thing. And maybe for followers,
[03:03:36.500 --> 03:03:43.500]  that's the case, but it's not here. It's just so crazy that this is brazen tyranny. This
[03:03:43.500 --> 03:03:53.780]  is butt naked, flaming death, cancer. It should be rejected by everybody, but it's not being.
[03:03:53.780 --> 03:03:59.140]  And that shows you people have become domesticated. They've become stupid. And not all of us,
[03:03:59.140 --> 03:04:05.760]  in a large portion, and so we're in a crisis. So we have very powerful report with Mark
[03:04:05.760 --> 03:04:09.380]  Dice coming up and then Paul Watson. And, you know, they're going to ban Mark Dice too.
[03:04:09.380 --> 03:04:14.140]  They're just going to go right down the line, like Matt Rudge said at these offices three
[03:04:14.140 --> 03:04:20.340]  years ago, three and a half years ago. Come back and see us, Matt. I can't bet he says
[03:04:20.340 --> 03:04:28.500]  that he's in one other interview since then. But the point is, is that it all happens. And
[03:04:28.500 --> 03:04:32.700]  we should have even more earnestly set up backups. But we did set up the backups, our
[03:04:32.700 --> 03:04:36.340]  own video, our own audio, our own websites, and they're trying to take those away and
[03:04:36.340 --> 03:04:40.740]  our bank accounts and our servers. I mean, it's a daily warrior, but we're not victims.
[03:04:40.740 --> 03:04:47.660]  It's made us stronger. But our power is you. You're the oxygen in our lungs. So please
[03:04:47.660 --> 03:05:02.060]  financially support us into great products at infowarstore.com. Stay with us.
[03:05:02.060 --> 03:05:30.020]  We've got a limited quantity of these left right now. We're basically selling these
[03:05:30.020 --> 03:05:35.180]  at cost because there was a big overhaul. Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star
[03:05:35.180 --> 03:05:41.180]  reviews for yourself. I've got two in my home. You will notice the difference, ladies and

[03:05:48.620 --> 03:06:05.740]  in your home. Have clean air. Go to infowarstore.com.
[03:06:05.740 --> 03:06:12.300]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government coverups. You want to stop tyranny? Well,
[03:06:12.300 --> 03:06:20.500]  so does he. Live from the infowar.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:20.500 --> 03:06:24.940]  Well, Joseph Watson, Laura Loomer, and Bob Ligonopoulos were just unpersoned by Facebook
[03:06:24.940 --> 03:06:29.420]  yesterday in the latest purge of prominent conservative voices, and they were labeled
[03:06:29.420 --> 03:06:34.940]  dangerous people and then lumped in with Lewis Farrakhan. It was also banned. Of course,
[03:06:34.940 --> 03:06:41.300]  Facebook did not ban the Smash Racism DC page, the Antifa DC page, which organized that
[03:06:41.300 --> 03:06:46.380]  harassment campaign against Tucker Carlson by literally creating an event for it, posting
[03:06:46.380 --> 03:06:52.180]  his home address, surrounding his home, and then telling him that, quote, he's not safe
[03:06:52.180 --> 03:07:13.580]  and they know where he sleeps. Nope, that didn't violate Facebook's terms of service,
[03:07:13.580 --> 03:07:19.220]  but Paul, Laura, and Milo criticizing Islam does. What else is interesting is that the
[03:07:19.220 --> 03:07:24.420]  reports were already published and circulating from CNN, of course, and others saying that
[03:07:24.420 --> 03:07:29.220]  they were banned before they were actually banned. It looks like CNN had their article
[03:07:29.220 --> 03:07:33.660]  written and ready to publish for the moment the ban took place, and then once they were
[03:07:33.660 --> 03:07:38.460]  given the heads up from their Facebook contact, yep, we're going to ban them right now, they
[03:07:38.460 --> 03:07:44.060]  published the article, but it took Facebook a few minutes to finally get around to actually
[03:07:44.060 --> 03:07:50.100]  deleting the accounts. The Atlantic is reporting that if anybody posts any infowars, articles,
[03:07:50.100 --> 03:07:56.460]  or videos on their Facebook page, those posts will be removed and repeat offenders will
[03:07:56.460 --> 03:08:02.900]  also be banned. TechCrunch is reporting that Facebook may start engaging in pre-crime detection,
[03:08:02.900 --> 03:08:08.340]  like the Tom Cruise movie Minority Report, and it may just start deleting people's pages
[03:08:08.340 --> 03:08:13.900]  before they actually violate the policies. In her book, Hate, Why We Should Resist It with
[03:08:13.900 --> 03:08:19.940]  Free Speech Not Censorship by Nadine Straussman, the former president of the ACLU, she quotes
[03:08:19.940 --> 03:08:25.420]  George Washington University professor Jeffrey Rosen, who says that social media platforms,
[03:08:25.420 --> 03:08:29.740]  although not formally bound by the First Amendment, since they are technically private
[03:08:29.740 --> 03:08:35.060]  corporations, right, they have a democratic obligation to embrace something close to
[03:08:35.060 --> 03:08:40.220]  the constitutional standard. Like universities and media outlets, online speech platforms
[03:08:40.220 --> 03:08:45.580]  should not be safe spaces, they should be democratic spaces, with the ultimate victors
[03:08:45.580 --> 03:08:51.300]  in the clash of ideas determined by reason and deliberation. She also points out that
[03:08:51.300 --> 03:08:56.460]  prior to the Civil War, many southern states made it illegal for people to actually denounce
[03:08:56.460 --> 03:09:02.980]  slavery because they didn't want abolitionist ideas to spread, saying, quote, the leading
[03:09:02.980 --> 03:09:09.580]  pro-slavery advocate, Senator John C. Calhoun, argued that abolitionists who criticized slavery
[03:09:09.580 --> 03:09:16.460]  libeled to self and inflicted emotional injury. During the 1830s, many southern states enacted
[03:09:16.460 --> 03:09:23.220]  laws, suppressing abolitionist speech, which was feared to spur violence, in particular,
[03:09:23.220 --> 03:09:28.780]  slave rebellions, and indeed to threaten the nation's very survival. So at one time it
[03:09:28.780 --> 03:09:33.820]  was actually illegal in certain states to say that you were against slavery. Kind of
[03:09:33.820 --> 03:09:37.700]  like today how it's a violation of big text terms of service to say that there are only
[03:09:37.700 --> 03:09:43.140]  two genders. But Congressman Jamie Raskin and other Democrats say that it's just a conspiracy
[03:09:43.140 --> 03:09:46.140]  theory that conservatives are being censored on social media.
[03:09:46.140 --> 03:09:52.620]  So today, we resume consideration of the entirely imaginary narrative that social media companies
[03:09:52.620 --> 03:09:57.340]  are biased against conservatives, companies I should add whose platforms were used to
[03:09:57.340 --> 03:10:02.700]  spread vicious Russian propaganda that helped to elect Donald Trump president.
[03:10:02.700 --> 03:10:06.900]  Oh, I'm just imagining that Paul Joseph Watson's Facebook page has been deleted. Did you want
[03:10:06.900 --> 03:10:09.140]  to say something stupid, Java the Hunt Nadler?
[03:10:09.140 --> 03:10:13.500]  But before we delve into these questions, I must first dispense with a completely illegitimate
[03:10:13.500 --> 03:10:18.700]  issue, which is the fantasy dreamed up by some conservatives that Google and other online
[03:10:18.700 --> 03:10:24.140]  platforms have an anti-conservative bias. As I've said repeatedly, no credible evidence
[03:10:24.140 --> 03:10:27.500]  supports this right wing conspiracy theory.
[03:10:27.500 --> 03:10:31.980]  That's a conspiracy fact, sir. And speaking of conspiracies, here's a clip from G. Edward
[03:10:31.980 --> 03:10:36.920]  Griffin from 50 years ago. He's the author of the fantastic book, The Creature from
[03:10:36.920 --> 03:10:42.420]  Jekyll Island, exposing the Federal Reserve Banking Cartel warning about just this kind
[03:10:42.420 --> 03:10:43.420]  of thing.
[03:10:43.420 --> 03:10:48.700]  In 1943, the following directive was issued from party headquarters to all communists
[03:10:48.700 --> 03:10:55.940]  in the United States. It read, when certain obstructionists become too irritating, label
[03:10:55.940 --> 03:11:03.300]  them after suitable buildups as fascist or Nazi or anti-Semitic, and use the prestige
[03:11:03.300 --> 03:11:09.380]  of anti-fascist and tolerance organizations to discredit them. In the public mind, constantly
[03:11:09.380 --> 03:11:15.480]  associate those who oppose us with those names which already have a bad smell. The association
[03:11:15.480 --> 03:11:20.100]  will, after enough repetition, become fact in the public mind.
[03:11:20.100 --> 03:11:25.620]  That was a clip produced by the John Barch Society for a presentation back in 1969, 50
[03:11:25.620 --> 03:11:26.620]  years ago.
[03:11:26.620 --> 03:11:30.620]  Let's not forget that Project Veritas recently obtained some leaked documents from inside
[03:11:30.620 --> 03:11:36.220]  of Facebook that showed that they had labeled Lauren Chen, formerly known as Roaming Millennial,
[03:11:36.220 --> 03:11:39.220]  as producing videos that were destructive.
[03:11:39.220 --> 03:11:43.580]  How dare a beautiful woman be conservative and post videos on Facebook, you're a hateful
[03:11:43.580 --> 03:11:48.020]  Nazi! At this rate, it won't be much longer until the big tech companies start banning
[03:11:48.020 --> 03:11:52.300]  people for saying that abortion is murder because they'll consider it to be hateful
[03:11:52.300 --> 03:11:54.500]  against the people who murder their babies.
[03:11:54.500 --> 03:11:58.020]  I'm getting really sick of this censorship, so I want every single one of you to create
[03:11:58.020 --> 03:12:02.580]  a new contact in your phone and save the number to the United States Capitol Switch
[03:12:02.580 --> 03:12:07.900]  Board in there and call them as soon as this video is done and call them every time somebody
[03:12:07.900 --> 03:12:09.820]  new gets censored.
[03:12:09.820 --> 03:12:13.780]  All you need to do is call this number and they will forward your call to your Senator
[03:12:13.780 --> 03:12:18.180]  or your member in the House of Representatives and you tell them what's going on.
[03:12:18.180 --> 03:12:21.860]  From now on, instead of just posting about it on social media or making YouTube videos
[03:12:21.860 --> 03:12:27.100]  about it every time somebody new gets censored, we're going to start calling Congress.
[03:12:27.100 --> 03:12:30.060]  And there's the number to the White House guys, I want every single one of you to save
[03:12:30.060 --> 03:12:35.220]  it in your phones and it's time to start making our voices heard loud and clear.
[03:12:35.220 --> 03:12:39.820]  In times of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[03:12:39.820 --> 03:12:44.380]  I gave you a little bit too much truth and now I must be silenced.
[03:12:44.380 --> 03:12:49.460]  Banned by Facebook, banned by Instagram and now the media says Lewis Farrakhan is far
[03:12:49.460 --> 03:12:50.460]  right.
[03:12:50.460 --> 03:12:51.460]  What?
[03:12:51.460 --> 03:12:54.860]  They obviously banned Farrakhan at the same time to give them the excuse that this wasn't
[03:12:54.860 --> 03:12:55.860]  political.
[03:12:55.860 --> 03:12:57.580]  It was totally political.
[03:12:57.580 --> 03:13:00.820]  This is nothing less than election meddling.
[03:13:00.820 --> 03:13:05.340]  Trump Facebook has banned was instrumental in getting Donald Trump elected.
[03:13:05.340 --> 03:13:06.500]  This is punishment.
[03:13:06.500 --> 03:13:08.180]  This is a political purge.
[03:13:08.180 --> 03:13:12.580]  This has nothing to do with hate or violating terms of service.
[03:13:12.580 --> 03:13:14.860]  Russians buy a few Facebook ads.
[03:13:14.860 --> 03:13:15.860]  Leftists.
[03:13:15.860 --> 03:13:16.860]  This is horrendous.
[03:13:16.860 --> 03:13:17.860]  This is election meddling.
[03:13:17.860 --> 03:13:19.940]  Democracy is at stake.
[03:13:19.940 --> 03:13:23.500]  Facebook bans most of the people who helped get Trump elected.
[03:13:23.500 --> 03:13:24.500]  Leftists and boomers.
[03:13:24.500 --> 03:13:27.580]  Herderm a private company can do what it likes.
[03:13:27.580 --> 03:13:29.700]  The creepiest thing is not the bans.
[03:13:29.700 --> 03:13:34.860]  It's the threat that anyone else will be banned for talking about the people who were banned.
[03:13:34.860 --> 03:13:35.860]  That's chilling.
[03:13:35.860 --> 03:13:40.540]  That's giant corporations enforcing their own communist Chinese style social credit
[03:13:40.540 --> 03:13:41.540]  system.
[03:13:41.540 --> 03:13:43.300]  The leftists love it.
[03:13:43.300 --> 03:13:48.060]  I was given no reason whatsoever for being banned by Facebook or Instagram.
[03:13:48.060 --> 03:13:49.740]  So I'm dangerous.
[03:13:49.740 --> 03:13:54.220]  Someone who makes meme videos laughing at social justice warriors or is handing the power
[03:13:54.220 --> 03:13:59.540]  to decide who gets to have free speech to a handful of giant politically partisan corporations
[03:13:59.540 --> 03:14:00.900]  dangerous.
[03:14:00.900 --> 03:14:02.260]  What's more dangerous?
[03:14:02.260 --> 03:14:08.260]  They put me on a list with terrorists, human traffickers and serial killers because I criticize
[03:14:08.260 --> 03:14:12.580]  modern art and modern architecture because I dare criticize mass immigration because
[03:14:12.580 --> 03:14:15.380]  I dare criticize a belief system.
[03:14:15.380 --> 03:14:19.860]  Yet you still host Antifa accounts which threaten to assassinate the president.
[03:14:19.860 --> 03:14:25.300]  You still host accounts belonging to the sicko who sent death threats to Ben Shapiro's family.
[03:14:25.300 --> 03:14:30.940]  This is truly, truly clown world and notice how the media were tipped off over an hour
[03:14:30.940 --> 03:14:32.660]  in advance of me getting banned.
[03:14:32.660 --> 03:14:37.980]  The same media that's been lobbying for conservatives to be silenced, censored and de-platformed
[03:14:37.980 --> 03:14:39.500]  for the past two years.
[03:14:39.500 --> 03:14:42.340]  There are barely any real journalists left.
[03:14:42.340 --> 03:14:47.900]  They're all activists abusing their power, working hand in hand with big tech to eliminate
[03:14:47.900 --> 03:14:48.900]  their competition.
[03:14:48.900 --> 03:14:53.740]  When are we going to see any kind of sensible regulations or laws to stop this?
[03:14:53.740 --> 03:14:58.220]  They're now removing people's ability to have bank accounts and credit cards because they
[03:14:58.220 --> 03:14:59.700]  have the wrong opinions.
[03:14:59.700 --> 03:15:03.700]  They're literally trying to remove your right to buy and sell.
[03:15:03.700 --> 03:15:05.180]  This is biblical.
[03:15:05.180 --> 03:15:08.620]  No right to commerce unless you have the mark.
[03:15:08.620 --> 03:15:10.660]  And what is the mark?
[03:15:10.660 --> 03:15:13.820]  Total intellectual castration and obedience.
[03:15:13.820 --> 03:15:15.540]  So this looks like it's the end.
[03:15:15.540 --> 03:15:18.340]  I'll still be at summit.news while that exists.
[03:15:18.340 --> 03:15:23.500]  While I exist as my entire purpose for existing is snuffed out.
[03:15:23.500 --> 03:15:29.780]  While society is handed over to deranged infantilized crybabies who think hate speech is challenging
[03:15:29.780 --> 03:15:35.740]  their stupid opinions, hysterical authoritarian clowns have seized control of the new public
[03:15:35.740 --> 03:15:39.500]  square and conservatives did nothing to stop it.
[03:15:39.500 --> 03:15:42.540]  The Trump administration did nothing to stop it.
[03:15:42.540 --> 03:15:44.220]  You thought it would stop at Alex Jones?
[03:15:44.220 --> 03:15:45.780]  You think it's going to stop at me?
[03:15:45.780 --> 03:15:48.660]  You think it's going to stop at Facebook accounts?
[03:15:48.660 --> 03:15:53.180]  They even demanded you to remove Ben Shapiro.
[03:15:53.180 --> 03:15:56.980]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the US.
[03:15:56.980 --> 03:16:01.700]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally

[03:17:27.660 --> 03:17:29.180]  I sued the IRS in one.
[03:17:29.180 --> 03:17:32.180]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.

[03:19:56.700 --> 03:20:07.500]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:07.500 --> 03:20:13.020]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Owen Troyer.
[03:20:13.020 --> 03:20:16.500]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:16.500 --> 03:20:27.060]  I think the ACLU needs to take a look in the mirror because remember what happened when
[03:20:27.060 --> 03:20:34.580]  private bakeries, private businesses, small businesses, specifically bakeries that didn't
[03:20:34.580 --> 03:20:39.940]  want to custom make a gay wedding cake.
[03:20:39.940 --> 03:20:44.940]  Remember the ACLU came out and the left came out and said, you're not allowed to do that.
[03:20:44.940 --> 03:20:54.300]  We as progressive liberal Democrats, we as bureaucrats, we as lawyers, dirtbags over
[03:20:54.300 --> 03:21:00.340]  at the ACLU, we decide, we decide who you can serve.
[03:21:00.340 --> 03:21:08.060]  So they didn't care about the sanctity of private businesses then.
[03:21:08.060 --> 03:21:16.660]  It's funny that they should care about it now when they ban conservatives off of their
[03:21:16.660 --> 03:21:17.660]  platforms.
[03:21:17.660 --> 03:21:27.420]  So I just have to ask the ACLU if they retract their 2012 article, businesses do not have
[03:21:27.420 --> 03:21:36.420]  a license to discriminate because isn't that what this really is at the end of the day?
[03:21:36.420 --> 03:21:41.900]  And I think it's pathetic that you have what would be considered, I mean, if you make it
[03:21:41.900 --> 03:21:45.700]  on MSNBC or CNN, right, I mean, you're considered the best, right?
[03:21:45.700 --> 03:21:49.900]  I mean, Fox News, I mean, those are the big TV cable news networks.
[03:21:49.900 --> 03:21:53.860]  They make the big money like you've got to be the best to get on a TV news network, right?
[03:21:53.860 --> 03:21:58.460]  Well, do you see what MSNBC and CNN puts on air?
[03:21:58.460 --> 03:22:01.740]  That's their best.
[03:22:01.740 --> 03:22:05.980]  And so it's like they just go along with this whole thing like, oh yeah, they censored Alex
[03:22:05.980 --> 03:22:08.740]  Jones because he's bad.
[03:22:08.740 --> 03:22:10.100]  He's a violent.
[03:22:10.100 --> 03:22:12.200]  He's stirring up political hatred.
[03:22:12.200 --> 03:22:13.700]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:22:13.700 --> 03:22:19.940]  Yeah, there's Cassie Casey Hill with Ben Collins yesterday who, the guy, both of them watch
[03:22:19.940 --> 03:22:21.960]  Info Wars 24-7.
[03:22:21.960 --> 03:22:24.260]  So I had to give Ben Collins a little fashion advice.
[03:22:24.260 --> 03:22:25.900]  By the way, I invited him on the show.
[03:22:25.900 --> 03:22:28.740]  I said, hey, you just did a segment on MSNBC yesterday.
[03:22:28.740 --> 03:22:30.700]  Yeah, that was the look on his face when we covered him.
[03:22:30.700 --> 03:22:34.620]  He finally actually had somebody watching his content because we covered it on Info
[03:22:34.620 --> 03:22:35.620]  Wars.
[03:22:35.620 --> 03:22:41.700]  I said, hey, you just did a segment on Info Wars and on Alex Jones there on the old MSNBC.
[03:22:41.700 --> 03:22:47.060]  Why don't you come on Info Wars and discuss it?
[03:22:47.060 --> 03:22:50.140]  And that was pretty much the response I got from Ben.
[03:22:50.140 --> 03:22:54.980]  But hey, he gets more love here than he ever does at MSNBC.
[03:22:54.980 --> 03:23:01.780]  It's like these Huffington Postwriters that follow us around and it's like that's their
[03:23:01.780 --> 03:23:10.180]  victory is just beating little gnats in our ear when they have no audience.
[03:23:10.180 --> 03:23:11.180]  But congratulations.
[03:23:11.180 --> 03:23:13.620]  I mean, look, you guys did it.
[03:23:13.620 --> 03:23:17.420]  You guys are killing free speech in America.
[03:23:17.420 --> 03:23:19.620]  Kudos to you.
[03:23:19.620 --> 03:23:20.620]  Good for you.
[03:23:20.620 --> 03:23:25.420]  The liberals and progressives and Democrats in the left used to be about free speech.
[03:23:25.420 --> 03:23:27.380]  What happened?
[03:23:27.380 --> 03:23:29.060]  What happened?
[03:23:29.060 --> 03:23:31.260]  That happened right there.
[03:23:31.260 --> 03:23:41.660]  That rat turd eating CNN host, Oliver Darcy, who applied for a job here and is so bitter
[03:23:41.660 --> 03:23:45.820]  because the truth is it doesn't take much to work at CNN.
[03:23:45.820 --> 03:23:48.460]  Oliver Darcy couldn't handle working here.
[03:23:48.460 --> 03:23:53.660]  He'd be wearing depends around this office if he had a job here.
[03:23:53.660 --> 03:23:58.660]  He might be wearing pull-ups now as he's probably tuned into this.
[03:23:58.660 --> 03:24:04.780]  So bitter little Oliver Darcy with a, you know what, eating grin on his face.
[03:24:04.780 --> 03:24:07.700]  This is a 40-year-old plus man, I think here.
[03:24:07.700 --> 03:24:17.420]  And he's so immature he spends his entire life trying to get Infowars banned.
[03:24:17.420 --> 03:24:21.340]  What a sad existence.
[03:24:21.340 --> 03:24:24.740]  What a sad existence for these people.
[03:24:24.740 --> 03:24:30.620]  So congratulations though, you guys have killed free speech in the West and you've now made
[03:24:30.620 --> 03:24:33.620]  it almost official policy.
[03:24:33.620 --> 03:24:38.340]  This will come up in the 2020 campaign cycle.
[03:24:38.340 --> 03:24:45.660]  And if there's a smart Democrat out there, they'll actually bring up the censorship issue.
[03:24:45.660 --> 03:24:48.860]  And then what is the left going to do?
[03:24:48.860 --> 03:24:50.940]  They're going to have to own that they're the side of censorship.
[03:24:50.940 --> 03:24:55.060]  They're going to have to own that they are against free speech.
[03:24:55.060 --> 03:24:58.980]  Just like they now have owned that they like abortion.
[03:24:58.980 --> 03:25:00.860]  They actually celebrate abortion.
[03:25:00.860 --> 03:25:03.060]  Yeah, abortion is legal in this country.
[03:25:03.060 --> 03:25:05.460]  That's a sad thing that people have abortions.
[03:25:05.460 --> 03:25:06.460]  But it happens, okay?
[03:25:06.460 --> 03:25:07.460]  It's legal.
[03:25:07.460 --> 03:25:09.220]  They love it.
[03:25:09.220 --> 03:25:12.580]  They celebrate it.
[03:25:12.580 --> 03:25:14.180]  They get off to it.
[03:25:14.180 --> 03:25:15.940]  And it's all about deception.
[03:25:15.940 --> 03:25:19.420]  It's the deception that they can tell you it's not a kid.
[03:25:19.420 --> 03:25:23.340]  It's the deception that they can tell you that's not another human being.
[03:25:23.340 --> 03:25:27.420]  It's the deception that they can tell you info wars is an extremist group.
[03:25:27.420 --> 03:25:33.100]  It's the deception that they can say Trump colluded with Russia.
[03:25:33.100 --> 03:25:34.460]  It's all about deception.
[03:25:34.460 --> 03:25:37.180]  The deception that they can say there's 76 different genders.
[03:25:37.180 --> 03:25:39.220]  And if you don't agree with that, you're a bigot.
[03:25:39.220 --> 03:25:42.540]  It's all about rubbing the deception in your face.
[03:25:42.540 --> 03:25:47.980]  See, they know the whole thing has been twisted upside down on its head.
[03:25:47.980 --> 03:25:53.460]  And so they just in the clown world as clowns use the clown system.
[03:25:53.460 --> 03:25:58.020]  It's like, oh yeah, 76 genders like that'll really take them off.
[03:25:58.020 --> 03:26:03.100]  Let's go with that.
[03:26:03.100 --> 03:26:09.020]  So who knows how much longer even anyone will be able to exist on these things.
[03:26:09.020 --> 03:26:12.180]  I mean, they're going to mitigate themselves into oblivion.
[03:26:12.180 --> 03:26:17.820]  They won't even allow political discourse on there at this rate in a couple years.
[03:26:17.820 --> 03:26:21.980]  So that'll even be the angle that they go with.
[03:26:21.980 --> 03:26:24.420]  And you know what, I'll just go ahead and say this now and I haven't even done my due
[03:26:24.420 --> 03:26:29.580]  diligence with the tech people just because there's so much else going on here.
[03:26:29.580 --> 03:26:37.660]  But I mean, we created a platform info comms.org and it's totally free speech.
[03:26:37.660 --> 03:26:40.820]  And I mean, we even go there because look, we have people to go in there and try to post
[03:26:40.820 --> 03:26:43.260]  things to make us look bad.
[03:26:43.260 --> 03:26:44.460]  And we know that that's what happens.
[03:26:44.460 --> 03:26:49.380]  And so we are trying to moderate it and censor that stuff, but it's just out of control now.
[03:26:49.380 --> 03:26:53.380]  And I'm just like, I'm just telling the IT people, I'm saying, just leave it open.
[03:26:53.380 --> 03:26:57.020]  People want to go on there and post whatever garbage they're going to do it.
[03:26:57.020 --> 03:26:58.620]  Let's actually be free speech.
[03:26:58.620 --> 03:27:04.540]  Let's actually be the public forum that they claim to be.
[03:27:04.540 --> 03:27:09.220]  But none of it's possible without your support at infowarstore.com and I know you know that.
[03:27:09.220 --> 03:27:14.860]  And so now that they're suffocating all of our, all of our ability to reach the internet
[03:27:14.860 --> 03:27:19.500]  market, all of our ability to market on social media, now that they're sucking all the wind
[03:27:19.500 --> 03:27:24.620]  out of our sales for that, all we have is this platform.
[03:27:24.620 --> 03:27:28.460]  All we can do is market to the people who know about this platform.
[03:27:28.460 --> 03:27:33.820]  So the least you can do is tell people about info wars, tell people why we're so censored,
[03:27:33.820 --> 03:27:36.180]  tell them where they can find this broadcast.
[03:27:36.180 --> 03:27:42.220]  And there's a reason why the young people like us, it's because we have that mystique.
[03:27:42.220 --> 03:27:44.580]  Oh, why are they censored everywhere?
[03:27:44.580 --> 03:27:45.780]  Why is it banned?
[03:27:45.780 --> 03:27:47.300]  What makes them so bad?
[03:27:47.300 --> 03:27:50.820]  They keep saying they're doing hate speech and encouraging violence and they tune in,
[03:27:50.820 --> 03:27:52.900]  they hear none of it and they're like, what is this?
[03:27:52.900 --> 03:27:54.940]  There must be something else here.
[03:27:54.940 --> 03:27:57.340]  So take advantage of the specials at infowarstore.com.

[03:32:50.540 --> 03:32:53.540]  Go to InfowarsStore.com.
[03:32:53.540 --> 03:33:18.220]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he. It's
[03:33:18.220 --> 03:33:23.820]  Alex Jones, and now your host, Owen Troyer.
[03:33:23.820 --> 03:33:29.620]  We've got 30 minutes left of the Alex Jones show. I've got Robert Barnes in studio. I'm
[03:33:29.620 --> 03:33:34.340]  going to have a couple important conversations with him that I've just been seeing people
[03:33:34.340 --> 03:33:38.740]  having amongst themselves that we're going to get Robert Barnes expertise on, and then
[03:33:38.740 --> 03:33:41.180]  here's the deal.
[03:33:41.180 --> 03:33:47.900]  We did not take overall much phone calls this week, so when I jump over into the other
[03:33:47.900 --> 03:33:53.260]  studio here in 30 minutes on the war room that I normally host from 3 to 6 p.m. central
[03:33:53.260 --> 03:33:56.660]  at Infowars.com slash show, I'm going to open up the phone lines. Now, I do have a couple
[03:33:56.660 --> 03:34:03.580]  important guests, including Laura Loomer and a few others, but all the segments where it's
[03:34:03.580 --> 03:34:07.220]  guest free, we're going to open up the phone lines and hear from you because there have
[03:34:07.220 --> 03:34:11.980]  been so many developments this week, and we've just been so embedded in covering all of it.
[03:34:11.980 --> 03:34:15.420]  We haven't had time to take your phone calls, so I'm going to try to take as many as I can
[03:34:15.420 --> 03:34:18.820]  today on the war room. So if you're trying to call into Infowars, call into the war room
[03:34:18.820 --> 03:34:23.700]  today and we will take your calls. Now, I had the story and I wanted to get Robert Barnes
[03:34:23.700 --> 03:34:28.340]  take on just a few of the issues here before I ask him a question that I've just been seeing
[03:34:28.340 --> 03:34:29.680]  a lot of people talk about.
[03:34:29.680 --> 03:34:35.460]  So we have the ACLU putting out this story in 2012, and as you recalled when you saw
[03:34:35.460 --> 03:34:39.020]  the headline, the headline is businesses do not have a license to discriminate. That's
[03:34:39.020 --> 03:34:43.780]  literally from the ACLU.org. Now, we'll see if they print that same headline to stand up
[03:34:43.780 --> 03:34:48.500]  for Infowars, I doubt it. But the whole case that they make, and people will recall, it
[03:34:48.500 --> 03:34:54.420]  was a national case, was that if you're a bakery, small town bakery in Colorado, I believe
[03:34:54.420 --> 03:34:59.580]  there were a couple of them though, but that was the big one. And the story was a gay couple
[03:34:59.580 --> 03:35:03.420]  goes in and says, hey, I want you to make me this cake. And it's not like they're ordering
[03:35:03.420 --> 03:35:07.740]  a premade cake or pointing out to this, it's a custom made cake, they'd have to make it
[03:35:07.740 --> 03:35:11.780]  themselves to do the whole design. And the bakery, they said, no, we don't want to design
[03:35:11.780 --> 03:35:15.820]  the gay wedding cake. It became a national suit, national story, ACLU got involved, said
[03:35:15.820 --> 03:35:20.540]  you cannot discriminate if you're a private business. So that was a big deal. And even
[03:35:20.540 --> 03:35:27.180]  back then, I think most conservatives said, no, you can't do that. That's not free speech.
[03:35:27.180 --> 03:35:31.900]  So it was then, I think, when we started to see the left kind of go to anti free speech,
[03:35:31.900 --> 03:35:34.660]  and now the right being the party or the side of free speech in this country, that's like
[03:35:34.660 --> 03:35:41.060]  a flip from the 70s, like a reversal. But how is it that the ACLU can look in the mirror?
[03:35:41.060 --> 03:35:45.740]  I mean, these are attorneys, they have passed the bar, I mean, they can go and practice
[03:35:45.740 --> 03:35:49.380]  in a court of law. But yet they're going to say that businesses do not have a license
[03:35:49.380 --> 03:35:52.940]  to discriminate and then ignore all the discrimination happening against conservatives.
[03:35:52.940 --> 03:35:56.700]  One of the great tragedies in civil rights law over the past five years has been that
[03:35:56.700 --> 03:36:00.460]  a complete decline of the ACLU from being, I mean, I remember growing up as a kid and
[03:36:00.460 --> 03:36:04.100]  on my conservative friends called him the American commie lovin union and the anti Christian
[03:36:04.100 --> 03:36:07.780]  liberties union and all the rest. But I was a champion of the ACLU because the champion
[03:36:07.780 --> 03:36:13.700]  of the first amendment. And now what's happened is the ACLU has abandoned that to become SJW
[03:36:13.700 --> 03:36:17.820]  occupied, to have these sort of young lawyers who have grown up in a political culture that
[03:36:17.820 --> 03:36:21.740]  believes in safe spaces, not the first amendment to the United States. The only safe space
[03:36:21.740 --> 03:36:26.420]  for democracy, the only safe space for thought, the only safe space for idea is the first
[03:36:26.420 --> 03:36:30.900]  amendment to the United States Constitution. And those ideas of free speech, those ideas
[03:36:30.900 --> 03:36:35.500]  of free press are cultural values that we share across the political and ideological
[03:36:35.500 --> 03:36:39.260]  spectrum in America's history. And that means respecting them and protecting them even
[03:36:39.260 --> 03:36:43.260]  in the private workspace to the degree that's practicable or achievable. And so here where
[03:36:43.260 --> 03:36:49.820]  you have a public monopoly that has effectively a public monopoly over the public square,
[03:36:49.820 --> 03:36:54.220]  even though they're a private company, historically that we've understood that to be someone who
[03:36:54.220 --> 03:36:58.100]  has the same obligations under the first amendment as anyone else. At a minimum, they have the
[03:36:58.100 --> 03:37:02.460]  same obligations as any publisher. And yet right now, because of a combination of section
[03:37:02.460 --> 03:37:07.660]  230 and the Supreme Court abdicating its duties and obligations, and this discriminatory
[03:37:07.660 --> 03:37:12.700]  use of when private businesses are subject to discrimination laws, where if you're conservative
[03:37:12.700 --> 03:37:16.820]  you are, but if you're liberal you're not, then the net effect of it is that we have
[03:37:16.820 --> 03:37:21.100]  a situation where the public square is being monopolized and even though it's being monetized
[03:37:21.100 --> 03:37:25.220]  by these private companies for their personal gain and profit, billions and billions of
[03:37:25.220 --> 03:37:30.340]  dollars, it's now being monopolized for thought control, for speech control, for idea control.
[03:37:30.340 --> 03:37:34.540]  To such a degree that it's no longer just about does Alex Jones or Info Wars or Owen
[03:37:34.540 --> 03:37:39.500]  Shroyer have access to speak their mind, it's can you talk about them? Like right now it's
[03:37:39.500 --> 03:37:43.500]  Alex Jones at Info Wars. Tomorrow it's going to be, and Paul Joseph, well it's there.
[03:37:43.500 --> 03:37:46.220]  Then it's going to be Paul Joseph Watson and Owen Shroyer and it's going to be a bunch
[03:37:46.220 --> 03:37:49.420]  of David Knight and a bunch of other people. And they're not going to stop there. Does
[03:37:49.420 --> 03:37:53.020]  anybody really think they're going to stop with Info Wars? Info Wars happens to be one
[03:37:53.020 --> 03:37:57.020]  of the most effective independent press organizations in the world, but they're not going to stop
[03:37:57.020 --> 03:38:01.060]  at the most effective. If they can achieve suppression and censorship of this speech,
[03:38:01.060 --> 03:38:06.020]  if they can get customers and supporters and the audience to not be involved, not be connected,
[03:38:06.020 --> 03:38:10.220]  not share links, not talk about it, then they can be effective against anybody. That's why
[03:38:10.220 --> 03:38:14.380]  they've chosen Alex Jones at Info Wars as the tip of the spear, as the initial target,
[03:38:14.380 --> 03:38:18.780]  as the template, as the example for future use. And it's going to keep going and it's
[03:38:18.780 --> 03:38:23.500]  going to keep rolling and it's not going to stop. This is the most fundamental time that
[03:38:23.500 --> 03:38:27.300]  our First Amendment liberties are at risk. More so even than in World War I or World
[03:38:27.300 --> 03:38:31.220]  War II or Civil War, whenever we've had war, there's been a historic use or misuse of the
[03:38:31.220 --> 03:38:35.660]  free speech laws to try to suppress it or censor it. But now we're talking about systematic
[03:38:35.660 --> 03:38:39.860]  control of speech by private companies acting outside of the constitutional limitation and
[03:38:39.860 --> 03:38:44.460]  against its purposes and intentions. And if that Chinese social credit model becomes the
[03:38:44.460 --> 03:38:48.260]  American model, we're a technopoly, not a democracy.
[03:38:48.260 --> 03:38:53.180]  And where is this end? Like, where does censorship end? Is it going to come to a point where
[03:38:53.180 --> 03:38:57.980]  I have to be, like, hiding in a cave to listen to Alex Jones? Like, I have to get off the
[03:38:57.980 --> 03:39:01.780]  grid to even go to InfoWars.com? Or are they going to come after me?
[03:39:01.780 --> 03:39:05.340]  They're literally, it's like people who watch the movie The Matrix and these big tech people,
[03:39:05.340 --> 03:39:10.020]  Rio Red Orwell, Red Huxley, watch The Matrix and they thought, not, that's a world to fear.
[03:39:10.020 --> 03:39:14.260]  That's a world to oppose. We want to be Neo. We want to be the red pill. No, it was, man,
[03:39:14.260 --> 03:39:17.180]  everybody should take the blue pill. In fact, we need to create a world that looks like
[03:39:17.180 --> 03:39:20.380]  The Matrix. And that's basically what they're creating, to where you're so scared and so
[03:39:20.380 --> 03:39:24.460]  afraid. They're getting people to self-censor. So the goal is not just, hey, whenever you
[03:39:24.460 --> 03:39:28.140]  say Alex Jones' name now on social media, we're going to censor you. I mean, what's
[03:39:28.140 --> 03:39:32.420]  happening now is people are simply sharing photographs. Photographs of them and other
[03:39:32.420 --> 03:39:36.620]  people with Alex, with Paul Joseph Watson, with other people. And they were told to not
[03:39:36.620 --> 03:39:38.420]  only remove the photos or the...
[03:39:38.420 --> 03:39:42.820]  Oh, that was stunning. Just somebody who had selfies, basically, with Laura Loomer and
[03:39:42.820 --> 03:39:46.220]  Paul Joseph Watson, they had their photos removed. And, but here's the thing that I
[03:39:46.220 --> 03:39:51.420]  wonder, too, because that's a perfect analogy. It's like, do they realize they are the bad
[03:39:51.420 --> 03:39:55.220]  guys in The Matrix? Like, do they realize they're the bad guys in 1984? Like, they're
[03:39:55.220 --> 03:39:58.300]  the ones bringing that? It's like, I think that they like it, though. There's something
[03:39:58.300 --> 03:40:02.100]  sick that they like it. And then, like you said, too, I noticed, and this was kind of
[03:40:02.100 --> 03:40:05.940]  the original self-censorship, there's a lot of great journalists out there, but they will
[03:40:05.940 --> 03:40:08.340]  never come on Infowars. And you know why.
[03:40:08.340 --> 03:40:14.100]  Yes. Oh, precisely. I mean, it's this... When I was told, for example, there are other lawyers
[03:40:14.100 --> 03:40:17.380]  and there are other people to be careful about representing Infowars and representing Alex.
[03:40:17.380 --> 03:40:20.540]  You've got to be careful. Don't go into Infowars. Like, oh, you're bad now.
[03:40:20.540 --> 03:40:23.940]  Exactly. I mean, you're going to be politically attacked. You're going to be economically attacked.
[03:40:23.940 --> 03:40:27.180]  You're going to be professionally attacked. It's already happening. You have people trying
[03:40:27.180 --> 03:40:31.100]  to kick me out of cases, people trying to remove me from cases, people trying to defame
[03:40:31.100 --> 03:40:36.500]  me in other ways, all just because I'm doing my job and doing my advocacy and doing my
[03:40:36.500 --> 03:40:41.700]  own first... Lawyers. And it's like, lawyers, murderers get lawyers. Like, what is it?
[03:40:41.700 --> 03:40:45.220]  People get lawyers. I mean, it's like... So, of course...
[03:40:45.220 --> 03:40:48.500]  Well, look at it. There's a Fundamentals of the United States Supreme Court case, 1991,
[03:40:48.500 --> 03:40:52.420]  Gentile versus State Bar of Nevada. And what happened, what he did is really, you know,
[03:40:52.420 --> 03:40:55.740]  was arguably scandalous, but in fact, was important for him to do for his client. Client
[03:40:55.740 --> 03:40:59.580]  gets indicted. He comes out and says the prosecutor's corrupt and they should have indicted the
[03:40:59.580 --> 03:41:03.860]  corrupt cops who are completely framed by client and is being used as a scapegoat. Now,
[03:41:03.860 --> 03:41:08.300]  that's... And he was just a few months away from jury trial at that time. So, that was...
[03:41:08.300 --> 03:41:12.620]  If anything was scurrilous or scandalous, that was. U.S. Supreme Court unanimously comes
[03:41:12.620 --> 03:41:16.540]  in and says that's completely protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.
[03:41:16.540 --> 03:41:21.460]  Not only that, the famous quote, it said, the duty of an attorney does not start at
[03:41:21.460 --> 03:41:25.260]  the inside of the courtroom door. It starts in the courtroom of the public opinion where
[03:41:25.260 --> 03:41:29.660]  part of your duty, your obligation, your ethical duty, your ethical obligation to your client
[03:41:29.660 --> 03:41:33.100]  is to advocate in the court of public opinion why the case shouldn't be here. So, the fact
[03:41:33.100 --> 03:41:37.220]  that you have people are saying not only should info wars not have free speech to talk about
[03:41:37.220 --> 03:41:40.980]  its ideas of things in the past, not only should Alex Jones not have free speech to
[03:41:40.980 --> 03:41:44.820]  talk about his opinions about things, but the lawyer shouldn't even have free speech
[03:41:44.820 --> 03:41:48.780]  and free press to talk about defending Alex Jones in the courts of law in the court of
[03:41:48.780 --> 03:41:51.980]  public opinion. Which, again, so now they're not only attacking the First Amendment, they're
[03:41:51.980 --> 03:41:56.500]  attacking your right to an attorney, they're attacking your right to a fair trial. Precisely.
[03:41:56.500 --> 03:41:59.700]  They're trying to dictate who you can pick as your lawyer, trying to dictate what your
[03:41:59.700 --> 03:42:04.500]  lawyer can say in public, trying to dictate what your lawyer can say in court. It's frightening
[03:42:04.500 --> 03:42:08.300]  and it's very orwellian. So, I mean, in terms of your question, where does it ultimately
[03:42:08.300 --> 03:42:12.140]  go? It goes to a place where we're not allowed to think our own thoughts, we're not allowed
[03:42:12.140 --> 03:42:16.780]  to express our own ideas, we're not allowed to share our own ideas. Here you have Facebook
[03:42:16.780 --> 03:42:20.980]  just two days ago said, hey, let's bring everybody into the living room. Let's create a digital
[03:42:20.980 --> 03:42:25.740]  living room in your space. These will be private chats. In fact, the exact words were, we're
[03:42:25.740 --> 03:42:26.740]  going to bring back privacy.
[03:42:26.740 --> 03:42:32.300]  Well, let's actually talk about the difference here between small time bakery and these tech
[03:42:32.300 --> 03:42:35.540]  giants and where the difference is. But here's the incredible thing, because I was actually
[03:42:35.540 --> 03:42:39.340]  talking to someone recently and they were like, hey, you're talking a lot differently
[03:42:39.340 --> 03:42:42.180]  than you were like an hour ago. And I was like, guess how many phones are in this room
[03:42:42.180 --> 03:42:47.420]  now? And they were like, oh, and I was like, yeah, dude, that phone is literally listening
[03:42:47.420 --> 03:42:50.820]  to you. So, you better watch out what you say. But they tell you they're listening now,
[03:42:50.820 --> 03:42:52.980]  at least they're honest about it.
[03:42:52.980 --> 03:42:57.020]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment
[03:42:57.020 --> 03:43:02.300]  full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ. It
[03:43:02.300 --> 03:43:07.500]  literally dumbs the population down. And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers,
[03:43:07.500 --> 03:43:13.740]  the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations. First seaweed based iodine
[03:43:13.740 --> 03:43:17.020]  that was pretty good, but hard to source. And the globalists tried to block us getting
[03:43:17.020 --> 03:43:22.020]  a supply of it. So we discovered deep earth crystals, a pure nascent iodine and brought
[03:43:22.020 --> 03:43:26.980]  you X2. That's been incredible. Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we
[03:43:26.980 --> 03:43:32.820]  did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine. But chemists,
[03:43:32.820 --> 03:43:37.620]  scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds,
[03:43:37.620 --> 03:43:45.660]  two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bio available. Ladies
[03:43:45.660 --> 03:43:49.860]  and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[03:43:49.860 --> 03:43:54.580]  It's three now available at m4slife.com. Our grandparents, the great grandparents,

[03:46:57.220 --> 03:47:14.780]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:47:14.780 --> 03:47:22.780]  You've found it, the tip of the spear. It is the Alex Jones show with Owen Troyer.
[03:47:22.780 --> 03:47:30.840]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show, Robert Barnes in studio with his final segment here
[03:47:30.840 --> 03:47:36.200]  on this Friday. In fact, we're going to have a couple special broadcasts live this weekend
[03:47:36.200 --> 03:47:41.120]  as well. So be sure to tune in to infowars.com slash show over the weekend. I'll just leave
[03:47:41.120 --> 03:47:46.440]  it there. I got two big questions for Robert Barnes here as we close us out in regards
[03:47:46.440 --> 03:47:50.200]  to the censorship. Now we were discussing this all fair but the big difference, I think
[03:47:50.200 --> 03:47:55.560]  this is obvious. Now I'm not sure what type of investigations are going on, what type
[03:47:55.560 --> 03:47:59.800]  of information Trump has or other people might have, but I think it's safe to assume that
[03:47:59.800 --> 03:48:05.400]  these big tech companies, Facebook, Twitter, Google, YouTube have gotten government contracts
[03:48:05.400 --> 03:48:09.400]  somewhere down the road. What we would call black contracts, you're not going to see them,
[03:48:09.400 --> 03:48:12.880]  you're not going to hear about them, but they're there and it's for quote unquote security
[03:48:12.880 --> 03:48:19.840]  purposes we'll say. So let's say then that Twitter or Facebook or YouTube has some sort
[03:48:19.840 --> 03:48:24.760]  of government contract. Well, some small time bakery in Colorado doesn't have a government
[03:48:24.760 --> 03:48:29.960]  contract, but what we saw happen is the ACLU everybody got involved, they tell the baker
[03:48:29.960 --> 03:48:34.880]  you have to bake this gay cake, you cannot discriminate. So if you apply that same logic,
[03:48:34.880 --> 03:48:38.420]  Twitter, Facebook, YouTube cannot discriminate against conservatives, which they're so clearly
[03:48:38.420 --> 03:48:44.040]  doing they've been caught on, you know, undercover cameras, admitting all this. Okay, so maybe
[03:48:44.040 --> 03:48:48.960]  you'll say like the ACLU said in 2012, private businesses have the right to discriminate,
[03:48:48.960 --> 03:48:53.140]  which I would actually think that that's a fair argument to have. But if they're getting
[03:48:53.140 --> 03:48:58.480]  government contracts, does that change the game, change rules? Absolutely. You compare
[03:48:58.480 --> 03:49:04.280]  the baker to Facebook. The baker is not offering a platform for public communication. The baker
[03:49:04.280 --> 03:49:08.360]  is simply making cakes. And that was the point that the US Supreme Court made the bakers
[03:49:08.360 --> 03:49:13.440]  not required to offer a platform for public space for publication of speech. That's precisely
[03:49:13.440 --> 03:49:18.640]  what Facebook is. Facebook provides a platform for the publication of speech. So that makes
[03:49:18.640 --> 03:49:23.840]  it very different legally from the from the baker. The second aspect is they are a federal
[03:49:23.840 --> 03:49:28.240]  contract recipient. And so once you saw the president go out and say that because colleges
[03:49:28.240 --> 03:49:32.440]  and universities receive federal funds, often through contracts of different kinds for different
[03:49:32.440 --> 03:49:36.600]  kinds of research and funding, or sometimes through subsidizing loans or grants like the
[03:49:36.600 --> 03:49:41.040]  Pell grants or SEOG grants, that because you do that, then you are going to be obligated
[03:49:41.040 --> 03:49:45.400]  to follow free speech standards. We should apply the same rule to every federal contractor
[03:49:45.400 --> 03:49:49.400]  who provides a publication for private speech. I forgot about that. Trump already made the
[03:49:49.400 --> 03:49:54.200]  initiative with colleges to stop the attack on free speech because they're getting government
[03:49:54.200 --> 03:49:58.600]  stimulus, obviously. Exactly. That same practice principle can be applied to social media.
[03:49:58.600 --> 03:50:02.600]  Precisely. He can do that tomorrow. Tomorrow you can go out and say anybody that is involved
[03:50:02.600 --> 03:50:07.760]  in the social media space or provides a platform for the publication of either private press
[03:50:07.760 --> 03:50:12.920]  or private speech of any kind cannot discriminate on a viewpoint basis if they receive any federal
[03:50:12.920 --> 03:50:19.160]  funding of any kind. And that's every single major social media giant that exists. So effectively
[03:50:19.160 --> 03:50:23.240]  that would require them to reinforce it tomorrow. So that's the second big distinction between
[03:50:23.240 --> 03:50:27.520]  them. The third big distinction that the U.S. Supreme Court has drawn in the past, that
[03:50:27.520 --> 03:50:31.720]  the California Supreme Court has drawn repeatedly, and that and all of these big tech giants
[03:50:31.720 --> 03:50:36.000]  are located in California, so governed by California law, is that if they choose to
[03:50:36.000 --> 03:50:41.000]  become a public monopoly, if they choose to monopolize the public square, then they have
[03:50:41.000 --> 03:50:44.920]  obligations that are different than someone who does not monopolize the public square.
[03:50:44.920 --> 03:50:48.080]  So the equivalent would be, let's say you're in the public square, but you have just one
[03:50:48.080 --> 03:50:52.040]  little corner of it. Well, you're not under the same obligation as somebody who owns the
[03:50:52.040 --> 03:50:56.920]  entire public square. Once you own the public square and you want the benefits of that monopoly,
[03:50:56.920 --> 03:51:03.280]  a monopoly you acquired through special congressional immunity in Section 230, a monopoly you acquired
[03:51:03.280 --> 03:51:07.360]  by lying to people about promising to protect free speech, then you should be obligated
[03:51:07.360 --> 03:51:10.880]  to keep your promises and be obligated at just like any governmental entity. So would
[03:51:10.880 --> 03:51:17.000]  that be like saying Twitter owns the public square of Twitter, so therefore they have
[03:51:17.000 --> 03:51:23.000]  to allow anybody on there. But once you get on there, say Donald Trump, you can block
[03:51:23.000 --> 03:51:27.040]  whoever you want. You can have terms of service that allow different, like right now it's
[03:51:27.040 --> 03:51:30.600]  interestingly enough, they have said that the courts have said on the First Amendment
[03:51:30.600 --> 03:51:34.880]  standards that the president can't block anyone. So it's ironic, the president can't
[03:51:34.880 --> 03:51:38.600]  block anyone on Twitter, but Twitter can't block whoever they want. It's like this doesn't
[03:51:38.600 --> 03:51:43.480]  really make sense, that we have the ultimate censor, the ultimate controller, suppressor
[03:51:43.480 --> 03:51:49.480]  of speech, already surveilling people's speech and invading on their privacy on a regular
[03:51:49.480 --> 03:51:53.200]  basis. So if we're going to make this meaningful, Twitter basically said, hey, if you want to
[03:51:53.200 --> 03:51:57.400]  be Twitter and you in that particular form of social media space, like they have GAB
[03:51:57.400 --> 03:52:01.880]  and other competitors, but they have 90, 95% of that space, of that kind of communication.
[03:52:01.880 --> 03:52:07.000]  Well, and they get all the mainstream publications to put on. That's the key to me. You go on
[03:52:07.000 --> 03:52:14.760]  C-SPAN, ESPN, it doesn't matter. You name it, it's all in congruity. They plug Facebook,
[03:52:14.760 --> 03:52:19.560]  they plug YouTube, they plug Twitter. So it's a synchronicity. They're never going to plug
[03:52:19.560 --> 03:52:23.200]  GAB, they're never going to plug Bitshoot, they're never going to plug Brydeon, they're
[03:52:23.200 --> 03:52:25.840]  never going to plug Mines, they're never going to plug Swiss cows, they're never going to
[03:52:25.840 --> 03:52:29.320]  plug DuckDuckGo. So that's how they have total control.
[03:52:29.320 --> 03:52:32.440]  Exactly. And so when people say, oh, just go out there and create your own, that is
[03:52:32.440 --> 03:52:36.480]  not an effective alternative in the economic space. It would be like saying in the railroad
[03:52:36.480 --> 03:52:39.720]  era, well, go out and do your own railroad. Well, that's just not going to work because
[03:52:39.720 --> 03:52:42.800]  the best railroad tracks have already been laid, the best railroad tracks have already
[03:52:42.800 --> 03:52:45.960]  been established, the best railroads already exist. So you're not going to be able to meaningfully
[03:52:45.960 --> 03:52:50.520]  compete with them. Competition is not an alternative in a public monopoly space. And that's what
[03:52:50.520 --> 03:52:54.400]  they are. They are effectively public monopolies. They're publicly traded companies. And once
[03:52:54.400 --> 03:52:57.400]  you choose to monopolize the public square, you should be under the same first amendment
[03:52:57.400 --> 03:53:01.440]  obligations as everyone else. It's what the U.S. Supreme Court said years ago when a company
[03:53:01.440 --> 03:53:05.440]  basically bought up a private town. It's the same thing that the California court said
[03:53:05.440 --> 03:53:10.240]  in the prune yard decision about shopping malls and the public area component of shopping
[03:53:10.240 --> 03:53:14.840]  malls, that if those, if you're going to benefit and profit from monopolizing the public square,
[03:53:14.840 --> 03:53:17.760]  you should be under the same obligations as the First Amendment. And that doesn't stop
[03:53:17.760 --> 03:53:21.880]  you from including in your terms of service, compliance standards that prohibit obscenity,
[03:53:21.880 --> 03:53:25.800]  prohibit stalking, prohibit harassing, all those things are outside First Amendment
[03:53:25.800 --> 03:53:30.800]  protection. It's just incorporate the First Amendment. Don't engage in viewpoint discrimination.
[03:53:30.800 --> 03:53:34.480]  And consequently, you can have a meaningful public square that protects the public square.
[03:53:34.480 --> 03:53:38.080]  Otherwise, we're going to have a Chinese social credit model system where ultimately
[03:53:38.080 --> 03:53:42.080]  speech is going to be suppressed. Not only are we getting surveilled 24 seven, but our
[03:53:42.080 --> 03:53:46.520]  speech is going to be censored and suppressed. We're going to try to incentivize self censorship
[03:53:46.520 --> 03:53:50.480]  by the free press and by the independent press. And the First Amendment American experiment
[03:53:50.480 --> 03:53:54.760]  will be over. And that's the most foundational part. Most of America is not unique in world
[03:53:54.760 --> 03:53:58.800]  history except one big, big component. And that's the First Amendment to the United States
[03:53:58.800 --> 03:54:02.760]  Constitution. That's the absolute protection for the ideas and ideals of free speech and
[03:54:02.760 --> 03:54:07.320]  free press, which is what keeps the light of liberty alive in a light today. And without
[03:54:07.320 --> 03:54:10.760]  it, we're going to be a dead democracy and we're going to be a technocracy in the Chinese
[03:54:10.760 --> 03:54:16.200]  social credit model and the EU model. And that's why, you know, the Jack Dorsey's and
[03:54:16.200 --> 03:54:21.200]  the Mark Zuckerberg's are the jewel in the eye of the Obama types because they know they
[03:54:21.200 --> 03:54:25.200]  have that control and that's an ultimate power to them to shut down free speech. That's when
[03:54:25.200 --> 03:54:28.800]  a tyrant wants. They need to shut down free speech. I mean, look at China. All right,
[03:54:28.800 --> 03:54:33.760]  final question. We've got three minutes left here. So this is what people are saying. And
[03:54:33.760 --> 03:54:37.760]  I mean, you have to probably do a lot of the math and crunch the data for this, but it
[03:54:37.760 --> 03:54:44.600]  could be, you know, people want to know, would it be viable or would it be like, could you
[03:54:44.600 --> 03:54:50.000]  basically, could Alex Jones crunch the numbers from the Google censorship and everything,
[03:54:50.000 --> 03:54:55.360]  look at it all. And then in a defamation suit, sue for a billion dollars. The, well, I mean,
[03:54:55.360 --> 03:54:58.320]  these days, when you look at the kind of lawsuits that have been filed and the amounts of money
[03:54:58.320 --> 03:55:02.120]  banning it around, he would have a potential claim, particularly if he brings it up. He
[03:55:02.120 --> 03:55:06.480]  would, what I think is under consideration is a class action brings it on behalf of everybody
[03:55:06.480 --> 03:55:11.040]  brings it that this is a common pattern, common practice, common targeting and bring it on
[03:55:11.040 --> 03:55:14.480]  behalf of Laura Loomer, bring it on behalf of Paul Watson, bring it on behalf of wide
[03:55:14.480 --> 03:55:18.240]  range of people or all the people that share our videos and they get banned. Exactly. Bring
[03:55:18.240 --> 03:55:22.000]  it on behalf of all ordinary everyday people who no longer have free speech and free press
[03:55:22.000 --> 03:55:25.040]  and he's willing to be the tip of the spear, willing to be the front of the operation,
[03:55:25.040 --> 03:55:29.440]  willing to help raise the funds to make it a meaningful suit that can be effective. We
[03:55:29.440 --> 03:55:33.520]  will bring in all the best legal team across the country to achieve it, much like we're
[03:55:33.520 --> 03:55:37.920]  doing in the Covington cases. So the effect would be to go after them and they could clearly,
[03:55:37.920 --> 03:55:42.840]  it could rescript the entire landscape of speech and press in America. Now, the hard
[03:55:42.840 --> 03:55:46.320]  part is it's getting it through judges that are going to be the court systems that have
[03:55:46.320 --> 03:55:50.960]  to date believe immunity is so broad that they're not supposed to hold big tech responsible
[03:55:50.960 --> 03:55:56.200]  or accountable. But maybe now this is the only time and the only opportunity to do so because
[03:55:56.200 --> 03:55:59.280]  otherwise we're not going to have free press or free speech in America moving forward.
[03:55:59.280 --> 03:56:04.640]  Well, and I think that they see with 2020 getting closer. I mean, I don't know every
[03:56:04.640 --> 03:56:10.920]  day I'm convinced that I don't even realize how delusional these people are. So they might
[03:56:10.920 --> 03:56:13.800]  actually think they can pull something off here with the social media censorship and
[03:56:13.800 --> 03:56:19.800]  maybe somehow take the 2020 election. I mean, absolutely. I mean, the logical thing to do,
[03:56:19.800 --> 03:56:24.200]  there was a great professor, Professor Epstein did a study. His survey was that 2018 may
[03:56:24.200 --> 03:56:28.560]  have been the outcome of manipulation of news stories by the AI algorithms of Facebook,
[03:56:28.560 --> 03:56:34.240]  YouTube, Google and Twitter. So imagine what they can do in 2020 if they can make sure
[03:56:34.240 --> 03:56:39.040]  that the best most effective voices out there are not heard and can't even be spoken, can't
[03:56:39.040 --> 03:56:42.800]  even be talked about. I mean, literally they think Alex Jones has the power of Voldemort
[03:56:42.800 --> 03:56:47.160]  in the hurry. And people love their social media accounts. So they're like, Oh, well,
[03:56:47.160 --> 03:56:50.280]  I'm not going to do it then. I want to keep my social media. Exactly. And then that's
[03:56:50.280 --> 03:56:53.360]  the goal. And that's the objective. And if they can achieve that, then they'll be able
[03:56:53.360 --> 03:56:56.520]  to dictate the outcome of the election because they've already done from political surveys.
[03:56:56.520 --> 03:56:59.720]  Professor Epstein and others have looked at it. You can completely dictate the outcome
[03:56:59.720 --> 03:57:04.400]  of an election just by manipulating the what stories people see on social media alone.
[03:57:04.400 --> 03:57:07.280]  Just that. And I feel that there's a large portion of the country that doesn't really
[03:57:07.280 --> 03:57:12.280]  take this seriously because it is the older generations because they didn't grow up with
[03:57:12.280 --> 03:57:17.000]  social media. But that's the that's the key here is they are targeting the younger generations.
[03:57:17.000 --> 03:57:22.200]  This is what they want the younger generations to get up used to. Oh yeah, censorship here.
[03:57:22.200 --> 03:57:26.000]  That's normal. No, that's not normal. And so that's why we have to fight it. Robert Barnes
[03:57:26.000 --> 03:57:31.080]  always doing great stuff. You can follow him at Barnes Law on Twitter until they they'll
[03:57:31.080 --> 03:57:34.800]  probably find a way to ban him next. We'll all be banned. Eventually they're gonna have
[03:57:34.800 --> 03:57:38.600]  to ban themselves probably. All right, I'm going to take over the war room here. I'm
[03:57:38.600 --> 03:57:41.200]  going to switch studios. We're going to take your phone calls. Great guests coming up on
[03:57:41.200 --> 03:57:46.600]  the war room in fours.com slash show. I want to salute and commend every man woman and
[03:57:46.600 --> 03:57:51.280]  child that has supported this broadcast over the years and that has stood with us. And
[03:57:51.280 --> 03:57:54.880]  I want to thank all of our sponsors and all of our affiliates. But I'll tell you like
[03:57:54.880 --> 03:58:00.200]  it is, you've seen the unmitigated attack we've been under. You're our only sponsors. And
[03:58:00.200 --> 03:58:06.040]  when you don't buy the products, they're absolutely the best out there. We aren't able to continue
[03:58:06.040 --> 03:58:11.040]  on. So remember, you are the info war. I'm not the leader. You are the leader. When you
[03:58:11.040 --> 03:58:16.680]  take action, nothing stops you. We've got giant specials running right now at infowarstore.com
[03:58:16.680 --> 03:58:21.560]  that are unprecedented. And if you go there and buy great products that you already need
[03:58:21.560 --> 03:58:26.200]  from across the board, it funds the second American Revolution worldwide. So I want to
[03:58:26.200 --> 03:58:32.360]  thank you for your support. I want to encourage you again, go to infowarstore.com for whatever
[03:58:32.360 --> 03:58:37.080]  the product is you need. We have thousands of them. And it makes this all possible. Thank
[03:58:37.080 --> 03:58:45.160]  you for making it for as possible. God bless you.
[03:58:45.160 --> 03:58:49.200]  I want to say brain force is great. I want to say turbo force is amazing. It is. But
[03:58:49.200 --> 03:58:54.800]  if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil hill is it the fish oil is better
[03:58:54.800 --> 03:58:59.680]  than it. And that's an example of what I'm talking about. Fish oil is liquid energy,
[03:58:59.680 --> 03:59:04.160]  brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there. You've got the children's, you've
[03:59:04.160 --> 03:59:07.360]  got the adults, you've got the krill oil. If you're going to get the full effect, the
[03:59:07.360 --> 03:59:10.840]  fish oil and the children's are really strong. They don't give you the burpees, but krill
[03:59:10.840 --> 03:59:14.960]  oils is the best and it'll give you the damn burps. And I'm sorry. You want something like
[03:59:14.960 --> 03:59:19.400]  this, you don't get stuff for free. The krill is hallucinogenic. It's so good. In my view,
[03:59:19.400 --> 03:59:23.040]  I'm not a medical statement here, but let me tell you something. I eat five capillettes
[03:59:23.040 --> 03:59:30.280]  of krill oil before I go to bed. I'm seeing Santa Claus that night. So your brain is made
[03:59:30.280 --> 03:59:37.680]  basically out of what fish oil is. So we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice
[03:59:37.680 --> 03:59:41.600]  I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you. I just
[03:59:41.600 --> 03:59:47.280]  can't do it.
[03:59:47.280 --> 04:00:00.440]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
