[00:00.000 --> 00:26.120]  You want to stop tyranny well, so does he live from the info wars.com studios. It's Alex Jones
[00:26.120 --> 00:33.560]  all hell is breaking loose across the world is the move towards the singularity intensifies
[00:33.560 --> 00:39.960]  I'm your host Alex Jones. We're gonna be here for the next two hours live on this Sunday the
[00:39.960 --> 00:47.680]  Ides of March hard to believe it is the Ides of March the day Julius Caesar was stabbed to death
[00:47.680 --> 00:54.160]  you too Brutus in the Roman Senate in fact what was the year of that I just noticed that today is
[00:54.160 --> 01:00.960]  the Ides of March and I also just noticed on Friday looking up at the date that while it was
[01:00.960 --> 01:09.080]  Friday the 13th ladies and gentlemen where to begin oh my goodness do we not have a full spectrum
[01:09.080 --> 01:19.000]  of information to cover here's a little jiblet of the day Hertz puts cameras in its rental car
[01:19.000 --> 01:28.000]  says it has no plans to use them cameras and microphones in basically any quote smart device
[01:28.000 --> 01:35.480]  surveilling the living Toledo out of everyone and that will dovetail with an article that's top
[01:35.480 --> 01:41.560]  linked on drugs report dot com on the left-hand side protesters stage anti-robot rally at
[01:41.560 --> 01:46.920]  South by Southwest and we have a video report shot by Buckley Hammond who's also in there
[01:46.920 --> 01:54.760]  producing today with Nico Acosta rage against the machines shot by Southwest anti-AI protest to
[01:54.760 --> 02:00.080]  stop the robots group warrants against artificial intelligence takeover we need to see more of
[02:00.080 --> 02:05.280]  this because I'm not so worried about the artificial intelligence takeover if we thought it out and
[02:05.280 --> 02:09.920]  didn't weaponize it from day one and make it autonomous where its core function is killing
[02:09.920 --> 02:16.320]  people and surveilling and if it wasn't being designed by the globalist so forget whether
[02:16.320 --> 02:24.080]  it's AI or not this ubiquitous grid takeover is being used to dehumanize and predict human
[02:24.080 --> 02:29.040]  activity to manipulate human activity and bring in total tyranny so they really need to go
[02:29.040 --> 02:35.040]  protest over at Google in fact this is one of the ideas I have for South by Southwest a month
[02:35.040 --> 02:38.960]  ago we had a meeting it's in the notes I said I want to cover how they were really founded as
[02:38.960 --> 02:43.280]  an AI now they act all liberal and trendy on the surface when they're really basically a
[02:43.280 --> 02:48.400]  government globalist consortium front group maybe I should personally go down to Google and
[02:48.400 --> 02:53.880]  march in there with a camera and when they say down on 2nd Street why are you here you have to
[02:53.880 --> 02:58.920]  have permission why are you videotaping us I'll say but wait you go around grabbing all our data
[02:58.920 --> 03:04.320]  including Google cars stealing passwords to the new Google data breach personal info of users
[03:04.320 --> 03:14.520]  leaked due to Google error and again I don't have some giant for lack of a better term well the
[03:14.520 --> 03:20.400]  word is hard on I don't have I have a large repertoire of speech it is a family show but
[03:20.400 --> 03:24.200]  sometimes there's just not words to describe something without actually using the word
[03:24.200 --> 03:34.160]  arose still arose funny under name it's just what it is Microsoft predatory IBM Uber predatory
[03:34.160 --> 03:39.880]  Google predatory and we still have to work with Google some because it's so ubiquitous now it's
[03:39.880 --> 03:45.240]  like the water is poisoned but I still got to drink water if there's no clean water around Google
[03:45.240 --> 03:50.440]  is super bad folks super manipulative and all of their functions and they want to be the internet
[03:50.440 --> 03:55.240]  and the AI system to control the future of the world and they've got the best shot right now at
[03:55.240 --> 04:03.920]  doing it so that's coming up today again this is just one small area of the news over the
[04:03.920 --> 04:10.920]  top developments in Russia over the top developments in Pakistan over the top developments with
[04:10.920 --> 04:21.920]  Kerry and Isis and with Israel and Saudi Arabia and everything happening with Iran border patrol

[04:26.200 --> 04:31.560]  ordered to release them under the new Obama maximum criminal takeover you say why is Obama's over
[04:31.560 --> 04:35.360]  the top why are the globalist over the top because they got to break our will and set
[04:35.360 --> 04:39.840]  precedence to do anything they want anytime because stuff's going to get crazier and crazier
[04:39.840 --> 04:44.520]  under their plan so they just got to get us acclimated to troops doing gun confiscation

[10:04.680 --> 10:09.680]  all being admitted the terms and conditions i had in s a whistleblowers on the show to
[10:09.680 --> 10:15.160]  warn you i'm not so much worried about the rise of a i itself coming after us as the
[10:15.160 --> 10:21.520]  fact that corrupt humans are creating a technocracy that they control that is being pointed at
[10:21.520 --> 10:26.160]  the population there was a big protest in austin today u s a today covered it protester
[10:26.160 --> 10:31.880]  stage anti robot rally at south by southwest drudge report dot com linked the top left
[10:31.880 --> 10:36.640]  hand corner to our video with leon macadoo talking to the demonstrators today here it
[10:36.640 --> 11:02.640]  is
[11:02.640 --> 11:09.400]  and i ran into these extremists here with this pro humanity message this is atom stop the
[11:09.400 --> 11:14.640]  robot are you really out here to stop the robots are you against technology well so people
[11:14.640 --> 11:20.600]  are confused we actually i'm a computer engineer and we like technology technology can be used
[11:20.600 --> 11:25.640]  to help humanity it's already been used to help humanity and we think that the moral
[11:25.640 --> 11:31.520]  decisions of humanity should stay with the technology so today that we start creating
[11:31.520 --> 11:37.280]  technology that follows a moral decision complex that's not our own is the day that we're in
[11:37.280 --> 11:42.720]  danger and that already exists today and we want to make sure that in the near term future
[11:42.720 --> 11:50.880]  and the far term future humanity is spoken for we can use human morality in effect with
[11:50.880 --> 11:57.800]  technology not separate from humanity rather than create a technology that's a parallel
[11:57.800 --> 12:04.880]  of us something that exists against us potentially we need to create things that allow us to advance
[12:04.880 --> 12:09.560]  ourselves and one of the big things obviously that's going to happen very shortly within
[12:09.560 --> 12:13.520]  our lifetime that a lot of people aren't really prepared for an economist don't even know
[12:13.520 --> 12:17.360]  what they're going to do everything's going to be automated soon and there are going to
[12:17.360 --> 12:22.440]  be a lot of people without jobs now that could be great in one sense because we could all
[12:22.440 --> 12:26.960]  self actualize and write poetry but let's be real there's going to be a lot of us wandering
[12:26.960 --> 12:31.200]  around with nothing to do so what's the answer to that so I actually foresee a future where
[12:31.200 --> 12:37.120]  technology helps us expand our economy not just in terms of like agricultural production
[12:37.120 --> 12:44.400]  and things that potentially be automated but in terms of jobs and the intellectual future
[12:44.400 --> 12:48.840]  of mankind yes and that was actually one of the things that we learned at the AI conference
[12:48.840 --> 12:54.640]  I discovered is that soon with this automation currency as we know it is going to change
[12:54.640 --> 12:59.640]  the value of things will change jobs will be obsolete but those jobs that that are really
[12:59.640 --> 13:04.200]  you know people that will remain successful are those who are able to do the jobs the
[13:04.200 --> 13:11.200]  robots cannot do and so it's going to be about teaching humanity to be you know entrepreneurs
[13:11.200 --> 13:15.760]  and to think and to be creative and go beyond this what they're teaching us at school right
[13:15.760 --> 13:20.880]  now is to just be robots well today there's people that are that are doing things for
[13:20.880 --> 13:25.600]  their communities for their families for their for their nations for humanity in general
[13:25.600 --> 13:30.960]  that aren't being paid for it there's people on online forums investing extreme amounts
[13:30.960 --> 13:37.680]  of time helping other people expanding on the human condition and they're not part of
[13:37.680 --> 13:40.880]  the current economy they're doing this in their own spare time and so there are ways
[13:40.880 --> 13:45.280]  that we can create technology that we have we can't fathom right now where people will
[13:45.280 --> 13:50.920]  have jobs and as long as we keep that in mind as we build technology into the future and
[13:50.920 --> 13:56.600]  don't pigeonhole humanity into something where I don't know let's go extreme AI controls
[13:56.600 --> 14:00.360]  the nuclear warheads on the planet and all of a sudden it's got a glitch because the
[14:00.360 --> 14:05.000]  programmer did something wrong and then all of a sudden humanity is destroyed yeah you
[14:05.000 --> 14:12.280]  know who knows it's we need to keep I like to use the airplane example right now we have
[14:12.280 --> 14:17.880]  planes that fly themselves I mean even corporate jets commercial airlines can can take off
[14:17.880 --> 14:22.880]  and land themselves and so the pilot doesn't have to actually do much flying but when we
[14:22.880 --> 14:31.240]  put 50 people up in the air we put a human behind the plane the full report is up on
[14:31.240 --> 14:35.520]  info wars dot com prison planet dot com and the easiest place to find it because it's
[14:35.520 --> 14:39.320]  rolled down on our page to near the bottom drudge report dot com you can read the us
[14:39.320 --> 14:44.360]  today article that goes along with it we have to have a debate about the future of humanity
[14:44.360 --> 14:50.800]  period because bill joy of some micro systems I mentioned this a lot because he wrote about
[14:50.800 --> 14:57.240]  it in the lengthy article back in 1999 for wire magazine he wrote why the future does
[14:57.240 --> 15:02.240]  it need us our most powerful 21st century technologies robotics genetic engineering
[15:02.240 --> 15:05.600]  and nano tech are threatening to make humans an endangered species and I want to explain
[15:05.600 --> 15:11.320]  something he goes into meeting with 200 top globalist top computer owners he himself multi
[15:11.320 --> 15:15.960]  billionaire and the decision was made they're not just going to let us wander around like
[15:15.960 --> 15:20.960]  lian was talking about and just write poetry all day they see the seven and a half billion
[15:20.960 --> 15:25.600]  people as a scourge on the planet you could argue we are hurting the planet but regardless
[15:25.600 --> 15:30.120]  the decisions been made to dumb us down put infertility drugs in the food and water this
[15:30.120 --> 15:35.320]  is all been announced and just kind of stun us with chemicals until we're all have Alzheimer's
[15:35.320 --> 15:41.160]  by 45 and just phase out 90 plus percent of the world population this is all official
[15:41.160 --> 15:47.000]  UN announcements everybody knows about this but people just go oh that's the plan so they're
[15:47.000 --> 15:53.360]  designing the whole grid to be a kill grid so it'll be killer robots mopping up the last
[15:53.360 --> 15:57.280]  of us and the elite will merge with the machines and become gods now that's what Ray Kurzweil

[19:10.120 --> 19:15.720]  formulations out there contain toxic ingredients synthetic additives and even GMOs introducing
[19:15.720 --> 19:21.880]  the all new ancient defense herbal immunity blend crafted with over 14 key ancient herbs
[19:21.880 --> 19:27.280]  and extracts to supercharge and prepare your body for what experts admit is the most dangerous
[19:27.280 --> 19:32.280]  season of the year we have rejected hundreds of other formulations in our quest to bring
[19:32.280 --> 19:38.000]  you what is simply the most powerful and comprehensive proprietary formula that we have ever created
[19:38.000 --> 19:43.320]  in the realm of herbal immunity experience the benefits of combining over 14 ancient
[19:43.320 --> 19:48.960]  herbs and extracts with exciting new advances in nutraceutical science now is the time to
[19:48.960 --> 19:56.760]  secure ancient defense for you and your family visit info wars life dot com or call 1-888-253-3139
[19:56.760 --> 20:04.560]  that's info wars life dot com you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[20:04.560 --> 20:26.720]  waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info
[20:26.720 --> 20:35.560]  war the video is halfway down on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com we're gonna
[20:35.560 --> 20:38.160]  put it on twitter and facebook as well arm's citizens march in south by southwestern austin
[20:38.160 --> 20:41.920]  that's important because the mainstream media is creating the perception that guns are illegal
[20:41.920 --> 20:46.840]  nationwide they produce most shows based in new york or dc or la where they basically
[20:46.840 --> 20:52.600]  banned most guns and then they go look we went to this guy's house and he had 10 guns dirty
[20:52.600 --> 20:58.080]  criminal or you have a gun on the car yes we're going to prison that's illegal so open
[20:58.080 --> 21:04.560]  carry reconditions the public to understand that more guns mean less crime and all the
[21:04.560 --> 21:08.600]  major studies but the mainstream media is out there brainwashing the public of the
[21:08.600 --> 21:13.440]  attorney general's words that's his words never heard that let's try to find that quote
[21:13.440 --> 21:17.400]  literally brainwash the public against the second amendment where the public in major
[21:17.400 --> 21:23.840]  studies according to la times and forbes believes that gun crimes up when it's down 51 percent
[21:23.840 --> 21:30.560]  since 1992 just departments own numbers but that video of an amazing gun march yesterday
[21:30.560 --> 21:35.760]  here in austin that needs to go viral is on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com
[21:35.760 --> 21:43.320]  and we've got our print reporters and our videographers and researchers and folks out
[21:43.320 --> 21:47.960]  on the streets and we're going to be having a lot of south by southwest news a lot of
[21:47.960 --> 21:53.960]  culture jamming news this week during the weekday broadcast 11am to 2pm central and
[21:53.960 --> 21:58.120]  of course you can follow all of that at real alec shones on twitter and of course at info
[21:58.120 --> 22:05.520]  wars dot com now before i get into the bad news it's confirmed internet power grab we
[22:05.520 --> 22:10.680]  got the FCC documents they released it two weeks and one day afterwards after the story
[22:10.680 --> 22:16.200]  was out of the news soon as it died down they released it like a horrible stink bomb in
[22:16.200 --> 22:22.840]  church very quietly hoping no one noticed who did it and it's worse than i thought it would
[22:22.840 --> 22:26.800]  have been we're going to be going over that plus it's totally illegal where it came from
[22:26.800 --> 22:32.960]  how it's being done and the hill newspaper reports on congress is basically pointing
[22:32.960 --> 22:39.600]  that out it's just blatantly blazing bravada just like opening the borders without even
[22:39.600 --> 22:44.360]  an executive order an executive order treason the president doesn't make law or obama shutting
[22:44.360 --> 22:49.920]  down power plants are going after bullets outside of law but they're doing it they're
[22:49.920 --> 22:54.760]  doing it and if they get away with it they'll get away with more before i get into that
[22:54.760 --> 23:00.520]  and the avian flu in missouri news that's really scary because when it jumps into humans
[23:00.520 --> 23:06.080]  it's like ninety some percent fatal before we go there let's get into the geopolitical
[23:06.080 --> 23:10.880]  news because i've got about six or seven articles here that all tie into each other
[23:10.880 --> 23:17.120]  when you're geopolitically literate the general public thinks geopolitics is boring that's
[23:17.120 --> 23:20.600]  why most college graduates can't tell you the three branches of government domestically
[23:20.600 --> 23:25.600]  and they can't tell you the seven continents and it's it's but they can tell you baseball
[23:25.600 --> 23:29.480]  scores or football scores or NBA scores it's not because they're even stupid they were
[23:29.480 --> 23:34.480]  brought up learning how to fill their mind with tripe it's much more interesting to know
[23:34.480 --> 23:38.560]  the different types of nuclear weapons it's much more interesting to understand the history
[23:38.560 --> 23:44.480]  of the russians or the chinese or the americans it's fascinating plus it makes you successful
[23:44.480 --> 23:50.960]  and informative i've talked to us ambassadors to different countries i've talked to top
[23:50.960 --> 23:56.200]  generals i've talked to insurance company heads i've talked to rocket scientist and
[23:56.200 --> 24:02.800]  they'll always be amazed at my general knowledge in their field and they're shocked and they'll
[24:02.800 --> 24:07.000]  say why my own engineers don't know this much stuff and i'm somebody folks that can't even
[24:07.000 --> 24:12.640]  hardly spell but i can certainly learn how things work and how they interconnect because
[24:12.640 --> 24:18.360]  it's fascinating i'm sure i could have become a football fan expert and tell you the sports
[24:18.360 --> 24:22.920]  course from 1976 or what happened in the 1984 Super Bowl or what happened this year in Super
[24:22.920 --> 24:27.800]  Bowl but you know what i don't want to know the jockstrap size of some arrogant roid head
[24:27.800 --> 24:35.560]  punk sorry just not into it but i do want to know about space probes landing on comets
[24:35.560 --> 24:40.680]  i'm into really neat stuff and you can say hey i'm a weirdo well that's fine being informed
[24:40.680 --> 24:45.040]  knowing known liars is a little weird back when this country was founded people were
[24:45.040 --> 24:49.000]  into speaking five six languages and not being con and being informed and being ready to
[24:49.000 --> 24:53.760]  fight they were called the greatest people ever by foreign historians in france and england
[24:53.760 --> 24:59.880]  and you name it now we're known as the dumbest knuckle dragging stupid most unhealthy people
[24:59.880 --> 25:06.200]  in the world because the globalist did a job on us plus we were so prosperous our ancestors
[25:06.200 --> 25:11.320]  gave us so much wealth we became a bunch of spoiled rotten punks that think just acting
[25:11.320 --> 25:17.480]  trendy and like we don't care about anything and being big slackers is cool not caring
[25:17.480 --> 25:23.320]  is cool not caring is not existing you're dead already that's what bill joy said they
[25:23.320 --> 25:28.240]  said look these aren't people anymore anyways the only question is there's going to be a
[25:28.240 --> 25:34.160]  lot of moral people who don't want to be slaves who are going to fight the technocracy and
[25:34.160 --> 25:38.480]  that's what the combat robots are going to be for and the surveillance grid and the predictive
[25:38.480 --> 25:43.280]  systems to know when you're going to stand up when you look around and see half the kids
[25:43.280 --> 25:48.040]  on your block with autism and a third of the people with cancer and you know you read all
[25:48.040 --> 25:53.560]  the government documents how they're doing it by design and laughing at us and oh no
[25:53.560 --> 25:58.560]  we've got to be mopped up huh we don't want to wear different colored socks and have little
[25:58.560 --> 26:03.200]  beards and you know act trendy and shuffle around have our girlfriends bosses around
[26:03.200 --> 26:08.120]  we're called men and the world doesn't need us anymore we're told it's the end of the
[26:08.120 --> 26:13.760]  age of men we'll see about that because when the men in the system find out they're not
[26:13.760 --> 26:18.520]  going to be brought into this new world order either when they find out it's a centralized
[26:18.520 --> 26:24.920]  spiritual takeover via machines by a group of adepts luciferians on the inside and that
[26:24.920 --> 26:28.520]  it's the end of humanity as we know it because the devil wants to play god and have a new
[26:28.520 --> 26:34.040]  creation when the elite find out they're going to be cut off there's going to be some major
[26:34.040 --> 26:38.600]  resistance and it's an info war ladies and gentlemen and reality is so much stranger
[26:38.600 --> 26:44.760]  than fiction but let's get into what's currently happening carry says us will have to negotiate
[26:44.760 --> 26:50.120]  with serious Assad Reuters boy that number two years ago when they used al-qaeda to stage
[26:50.120 --> 26:55.080]  a chemical attack twice on Assad's forces and then claim that the west had done it then
[26:55.080 --> 27:01.880]  it came out it was Saudi intelligence well now they say that the Saudi Arabian Qatari
[27:01.880 --> 27:09.400]  backed al-qaeda known as ISIS is so bad that we've got to get with Assad to try to take
[27:09.400 --> 27:13.960]  him out Assad who did nothing where women can go to college who was westernizing things
[27:13.960 --> 27:18.060]  and working with the United States he got set up but now I mean who even knows if this
[27:18.060 --> 27:24.040]  is true the policy is so deceptive and so war game and so multi-leveled and twisted
[27:24.040 --> 27:29.400]  they probably don't even know what they're doing but that's in Reuters that dovetails
[27:29.400 --> 27:35.920]  with this little jewel Iraq Kurds claim Islamic state use chemical weapons on them well Islamic
[27:35.920 --> 27:40.040]  state is al-qaeda who's been caught using it twice the UN even had to admit it but it
[27:40.040 --> 27:44.200]  wasn't Assad but remember our media saying Assad did it foreign media knew it was pure
[27:44.200 --> 27:47.760]  bull because they don't fully control the jihadis they just fund them and turn them
[27:47.760 --> 27:53.600]  loose like throwing a kid in with five starving pit bulls the starving pit bulls with rabies
[27:53.600 --> 27:56.960]  eating gunpowder for their whole life aren't under your control but they're going to eat
[27:56.960 --> 28:00.800]  that kid just like I put a hundred black widows in your bed at night one of them is going
[28:00.800 --> 28:05.200]  to bite you maybe two or three I don't control the black widows but I put them in your bed
[28:05.200 --> 28:10.720]  well it's the same thing the jihadis shot video with their al-qaeda flags launching
[28:10.720 --> 28:16.240]  the chemical mortars because they want to be rock stars online and that's what screwed
[28:16.240 --> 28:20.720]  up carries a little operation and then the army said in the Air Force said the Marine
[28:20.720 --> 28:24.200]  said and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs went to Obama that Saturday night and said
[28:24.200 --> 28:28.560]  we're not launching an attack tomorrow there's basically going to be a coup this even came
[28:28.560 --> 28:32.800]  out here and there in the news but it came out that the chairman went and said we're
[28:32.800 --> 28:37.000]  not backing al-qaeda remember the troops put out that meme I won't fight for al-qaeda
[28:37.000 --> 28:41.920]  in full wars dot com when we come back what's really going on in the Middle East it is

[33:59.120 --> 34:05.200]  ago and when you understand south by southwest you'll basically understand much of the globalist
[34:05.200 --> 34:11.080]  brainwashing model but we are obviously here hijacking south by southwest and i want to
[34:11.080 --> 34:17.220]  see what you think the most important south by southwest stories are and specifically
[34:17.220 --> 34:21.200]  you can also then comment on any other stories that we've already mentioned but i want to
[34:21.200 --> 34:27.480]  get callers from austin texas and i rarely do this sometimes i say callers from mexico

[35:01.800 --> 35:06.120]  understand how dangerous things are that's why so many former top generals and others
[35:06.120 --> 35:10.000]  are saying this is the most dangerous time we've had even worse than the cuban missile
[35:10.000 --> 35:15.560]  crisis you've got isis probably firing more chemical weapons at people after they changed
[35:15.560 --> 35:20.120]  their name from al-qaeda you've got carry now saying we want to work with syria's
[35:20.120 --> 35:28.080]  leader Assad basher al-asad after we've spent four and a half years our criminal government
[35:28.080 --> 35:34.280]  nato with turkey and others trying to overthrow the Assad regime and about half the country's
[35:34.280 --> 35:39.600]  occupied by al-qaeda and islamic state fighters with their al-qaeda flags it's all al-qaeda
[35:39.600 --> 35:45.080]  folks al-qaeda nomenclature al-qaeda funding al-qaeda flags running around blowing up and
[35:45.080 --> 35:48.680]  burning things and doing all this and cutting people's heads off and they blow up a bunch
[35:48.680 --> 35:54.440]  of more churches today we're going to get to that meanwhile i've got headlines here
[35:54.440 --> 36:01.240]  bolton former ambassador of the un calls iran deal unprecedented surrender and it's all
[36:01.240 --> 36:09.480]  a bunch of politics republican versus democrat you've got the u.s. and saudi arabian embassies
[36:09.480 --> 36:14.080]  on heightened security for whatever reason ap reports obama white house steps up pressure
[36:14.080 --> 36:20.200]  on republicans over iran the news is calling them traders because they won't go along
[36:20.200 --> 36:27.560]  with a deal with iran this is a bunch of double and triple crossing going on i understand
[36:27.560 --> 36:33.800]  israel's concern about iran having reactors but if there are inspectors and there are
[36:33.800 --> 36:39.040]  cameras in the reactors they're not going to be able for at least five to ten years
[36:39.040 --> 36:43.760]  depending on the numbers you look at get enough fiscal material for weapons plus let's expand
[36:43.760 --> 36:50.000]  on that from my sources in the military and i told you this about six seven years ago
[36:50.000 --> 36:53.880]  and then you've seen some of the news saudi arabia has had nuclear weapons for at least
[36:53.880 --> 36:58.040]  a decade and that was in the news last year that they're acquiring them now and said don't
[36:58.040 --> 37:02.120]  don't attack us iran you know we've got nukes basically how like israel's had nukes since
[37:02.120 --> 37:06.920]  the sixties but won't admit it south africa's had them that was later admitted i mean i've
[37:06.920 --> 37:14.280]  got really good sources okay i mean really high-level sources over the years a lot of
[37:14.280 --> 37:21.840]  them have dried up because now they're locking people up that exposed treason i mean i have
[37:21.840 --> 37:26.880]  sources on publicly like colonel shaffer who ran the operation against al qaeda abel danger
[37:26.880 --> 37:30.400]  and stratos ivy could have killed bin laden twice was ordered to stand down weeks for
[37:30.400 --> 37:35.040]  nine eleven and i mean he has been called in and screamed at repeatedly and he's now
[37:35.040 --> 37:39.040]  out of the military in a consulting role to the department of defense in the army and
[37:39.040 --> 37:42.800]  does some classified stuff and basically can really come on the show because even when
[37:42.800 --> 37:48.040]  he comes on and cover stuff in the news they call him in and threatening but needless to
[37:48.040 --> 37:52.560]  say ladies and gentlemen the military listens to the show because they know that i know
[37:52.560 --> 37:56.400]  compared to other civilian radio what i'm talking about never been in the military but
[37:56.400 --> 38:00.680]  i've been studying it for twenty five years but on air for twenty i've got the sources
[38:00.680 --> 38:04.600]  and i'm willing to stick my neck out and cover it and that's why they listen because
[38:04.600 --> 38:10.440]  they know we're not making stuff up and we understand what's going on and we decompartmentalize
[38:10.440 --> 38:14.720]  because we have sources high level and in other governments and in corporations where
[38:14.720 --> 38:18.600]  we can integrate it together and then give military personnel whether they're low level
[38:18.600 --> 38:27.640]  enlisted or high level commissioned officers or non commissioned officers we help decompartmentalize
[38:27.640 --> 38:32.800]  the matrix for folks and as what we predict becomes more and more true people realize
[38:32.800 --> 38:38.280]  this is a hardcore broadcast and i'm not up here bragging i get white knuckles sometimes
[38:38.280 --> 38:43.560]  realizing just how effective we are and how dangerous we are to the globalist and there's
[38:43.560 --> 38:46.640]  different camps of the government the whole government's not bad that's one reason we're
[38:46.640 --> 38:51.440]  so alive plus your prayers but listen don't expect this show to always be here this is
[38:51.440 --> 39:00.760]  not a game people this is not a game this is serious for the future of our country and
[39:00.760 --> 39:05.160]  the world right now being decided and elites are getting really reckless because they want
[39:05.160 --> 39:11.600]  to control the future of AI of the internet of human development and the elites need to
[39:11.600 --> 39:16.440]  just back off cool down think about how dangerous the system they're building because there's
[39:16.440 --> 39:21.400]  no way that this secures even their future activities and endangers all of us and i'm
[39:21.400 --> 39:25.480]  telling you there's real movements in government corporations to understand this i'm not the
[39:25.480 --> 39:31.640]  only one saying this people are really realizing this is dangerous to spend five million dollars
[39:31.640 --> 39:36.720]  to overthrow Ukraine and to move weapons and to move heavy armor into menace Russia on
[39:36.720 --> 39:40.800]  their doorstep when eastern Ukraine has been part of Russia for five hundred years back
[39:40.800 --> 39:46.520]  and forth does that mean Russia is wonderful no but look at this next headline while we're
[39:46.520 --> 39:52.040]  worried about Iran who's already got nuclear weapons so why does Israel want to blow up
[39:52.040 --> 39:57.080]  its reactors because Iran will become self-sustaining with those reactors they can't refine their
[39:57.080 --> 40:01.760]  own fuel they've not built up to a first world state they're the first area in the whole
[40:01.760 --> 40:06.240]  region except for Libya to get close to that in limited capacity and the globalists do
[40:06.240 --> 40:10.880]  not want any sovereign country that's self-sufficient they're making us unself-sufficient they're
[40:10.880 --> 40:18.200]  deindustrializing the u.s. this is their model and so they want to attack Iran and I'm not
[40:18.200 --> 40:22.840]  demonizing Israel it's a larger piece and all this the globalists want to attack on
[40:22.840 --> 40:29.120]  Iran at certain levels certain camps to to keep radical moolas in charge you attack
[40:29.120 --> 40:32.880]  Iran and blow up some of their reactors you're going to keep them from industrializing they
[40:32.880 --> 40:37.440]  really do want them for power and weapons down the road they want them for both let's
[40:37.440 --> 40:42.520]  just be honest but they already got some weapons at least two I can't believe I have to even
[40:42.520 --> 40:50.080]  talk this is so dangerous let me continue Saudi Arabia's got a bunch cruise missiles
[40:50.080 --> 40:56.960]  to deliver them you name it and the whole region's worried about those two getting
[40:56.960 --> 41:05.760]  in a fight with each other Shiite and Sunni Iran Shiite Saudi Arabia Sunni and so the
[41:05.760 --> 41:12.360]  big thing going on here it's so sophisticated I have trouble even figuring out it's all
[41:12.360 --> 41:16.760]  been war-gamed and I just think it's gotten out of control because the best laid plans
[41:16.760 --> 41:24.560]  of mice and men often go awry to quote a tale of two cities I know that's of mice and men
[41:24.560 --> 41:33.400]  but if you look at it it's just out of control and now if you're worried about Iran messing
[41:33.400 --> 41:39.520]  with Russia is the much bigger issue and here's the headline Putin Russia prepared raising
[41:39.520 --> 41:45.280]  nuclear readiness over Crimea and they've said openly they'll use nuclear weapons if
[41:45.280 --> 41:50.960]  it continues Russia is ready to bring its nuclear weapons into a state of the art during
[41:50.960 --> 41:55.720]  last year's tensions over the Crimean Peninsula the overthrow of Ukraine president president
[41:55.720 --> 42:03.320]  Vladimir Putin said in remarks aired on Sunday Putin also explained on previous admissions
[42:03.320 --> 42:07.560]  that the well-armed forces in unmarked uniforms who took control of Ukrainian military facilities
[42:07.560 --> 42:14.440]  in Crimea were Russian soldiers he made the remarks on state-run TV and a documentary
[42:14.440 --> 42:21.080]  so is Iran the threat or is Russia the threat and by threat if you go in a bearish cave
[42:21.080 --> 42:25.640]  and start kicking it in the face it's going to attack you the threat is the West wanting
[42:25.640 --> 42:30.760]  to dominate Russia when Russia is only trying to rebuild and it's not an offensive posture
[42:30.760 --> 42:38.520]  this is global domination by different predatory grips so there you have it ladies and gentlemen
[42:38.520 --> 42:42.880]  there's an article in the international business times admitting that the West is funding the
[42:42.880 --> 42:50.960]  war effort in East Ukraine so this is a proxy war with Russia it's incredibly dangerous
[42:50.960 --> 43:00.160]  when we come back we're going to look at the bird flu spreading in Kansas and more sold

[47:19.200 --> 47:35.880]  the mind of man thomas jefferson it's alex jones on the gcm radio network we are back
[47:35.880 --> 47:41.680]  live i don't think i've ever done this but we're going to take calls specifically for
[47:41.680 --> 47:46.920]  listeners in central texas you are attending south by southwest are people that have comments
[47:46.920 --> 47:54.160]  on south by southwest that's the big giant interactive film and then entertainment music
[47:54.160 --> 47:58.080]  event that goes on for more than two weeks two weeks officially but it just takes up
[47:58.080 --> 48:03.080]  the whole month of march now it turns the city into a hellhole with massive traffic
[48:03.080 --> 48:09.920]  and it's a microcosm of other globalist operations where they hype things up it's like a new gold
[48:09.920 --> 48:14.260]  rush where there are no real jobs in the economy there's no real jobs for all these trendies
[48:14.260 --> 48:20.280]  that have gotten these degrees and it's a bunch of corporations like mcdonald's handing
[48:20.280 --> 48:25.800]  out free food like crack dealers you know hand out crack to school children it's just
[48:25.800 --> 48:32.800]  a joke and you can see where this is going in the future as there's fewer and fewer jobs
[48:32.800 --> 48:39.400]  and basically these kingpins are like the scam artist that would wait out at the gateway
[48:39.400 --> 48:47.880]  to the west Missouri and other areas uh chicago illinois other areas and provision everyone
[48:47.880 --> 48:52.280]  who was preparing to go west with their wagon trains and if you didn't know what you were
[48:52.280 --> 48:56.480]  doing they'd sell you a wagon that fell apart 50 miles down the road they'd gouge you they'd
[48:56.480 --> 49:01.680]  suck every dime out of you and then send you down the road basically preying on your dreams
[49:01.680 --> 49:07.880]  preying on your hopes that's what fads are it's what modern fashions all about it's
[49:07.880 --> 49:15.680]  about controlling how you see the world instead of organic cultural values the globalist are
[49:15.680 --> 49:21.000]  waging war on anything organic that developed out of humanity naturally that we have ancestral
[49:21.000 --> 49:26.480]  memories to engage in the globalist are waging war against the family against sovereignty
[49:26.480 --> 49:32.040]  against national sovereignty against private property they're at war against the individual
[49:32.040 --> 49:36.880]  they're at war with humans like their space aliens from another dimension and i'm not
[49:36.880 --> 49:40.760]  saying that's what we're dealing with but it might as well be that i have analyzed the
[49:40.760 --> 49:46.200]  enemy operation for 25 years i've been on air for 20 i've read their publications i've
[49:46.200 --> 49:52.520]  read history books i've studied the latest manuals on technology and i'm telling you
[49:52.520 --> 49:59.040]  that ai will be a new life form on this planet and really at its core that's what this is
[49:59.040 --> 50:06.120]  about is selling ai and the surveillance society is cool so i want to hear your angle on south
[50:06.120 --> 50:11.240]  by southwest i want to hear your take on this and and other events that are sponsored by
[50:11.240 --> 50:16.080]  the biggest globalist companies the same globalist outfits that finance the gun control movement
[50:16.080 --> 50:22.400]  and the open borders they're all over south by southwest by the way i get invited to speak
[50:22.400 --> 50:27.400]  of south by southwest events i don't go i've been in films that premiere there and i've
[50:27.400 --> 50:33.040]  been on a bunch of tv shows and i just don't want to be part of it we instead this week
[50:33.040 --> 50:38.080]  throughout the weekday show coming up 11am to 2pm central we're going to be hijacking
[50:38.080 --> 50:42.280]  their memes their stories their terms and showing people we've already done it we've
[50:42.280 --> 50:48.280]  already got two stories international news from this and it just started friday officially
[50:48.280 --> 50:53.800]  right didn't just start friday i try not to pay attention to it but i've got the crew
[50:53.800 --> 50:58.440]  out there doing it so we're going to talk about globalist fads globalist advertising
[50:58.440 --> 51:05.320]  marketing edward bernay's propaganda and how they create these events like the oscars
[51:05.320 --> 51:11.840]  or sports the super bowl where it becomes so sick and we're all watching and obsessing
[51:11.840 --> 51:16.640]  on what they say and do it'd be fine to have something interactive if it was from the people
[51:16.640 --> 51:21.240]  and what they had to say that's what talk radio so great you call in you bring up topics
[51:21.240 --> 51:28.760]  you're you're involved not when you see something like south by southwest and that's how i see
[51:28.760 --> 51:34.240]  the south by southwest trendies i mean they're so desperate they're so scared they're i talk
[51:34.240 --> 51:37.320]  to them they're they're looking for a job they're they're trying to get out of mom's
[51:37.320 --> 51:42.000]  basement they're they're trying to find that magic thing you got all these google unpaid
[51:42.000 --> 51:47.360]  people they've had google intern movies to recruit them hundreds of thousands of them
[51:47.360 --> 51:54.760]  not being paid just hoping that desperately someday they'll be somebody and microsoft
[51:54.760 --> 51:58.920]  and and mcdonald's and they're all just there something that started out about music and
[51:58.920 --> 52:05.360]  independent film has just been turned into another globalist marketing pump to spew out
[52:05.360 --> 52:09.840]  propaganda so i don't really know overall where you're going to go with this i know
[52:09.840 --> 52:14.360]  where i'm going to go with it i'm going to break down some of the secrets of their manipulation
[52:14.360 --> 52:18.600]  and kind of open source the scam for folks to wonder why they're a south by southwest
[52:18.600 --> 52:24.960]  i'm going to explain it to you from my perspective which is dead on you can believe it but you
[52:24.960 --> 52:28.200]  can disagree with me if you like if you think it's a great thing sure it's like a lottery
[52:28.200 --> 52:33.720]  ticket you know george arwell marveled in s as he wrote not just uh... in his fictional
[52:33.720 --> 52:39.240]  allegory nineteen eighty four about the general public ever stopped obsessing on sports knowing
[52:39.240 --> 52:45.320]  ever sports or knowing all about uh... lottery ticket systems which were impossible people
[52:45.320 --> 52:50.080]  invest in lotteries all day spend their paycheck on it when one out of your fifty million i
[52:50.080 --> 52:55.920]  guess when the average lottery one in twenty million one in five million it's just delusional
[52:55.920 --> 53:01.840]  and that's what something like south by southwest is it's all about suckering the chumps that
[53:01.840 --> 53:06.800]  want to go west but at least if you want to go west of all holla to a free open land
[53:06.800 --> 53:11.960]  and be somebody and carve something out at least a lot of those easterners and immigrants
[53:11.960 --> 53:15.560]  knew how to work hard and were somewhat smart even though a lot of them got ripped off by
[53:15.560 --> 53:24.560]  the uh... dry good stores and by the provisioners and by the outfitters you need to know that
[53:24.560 --> 53:30.680]  something like south by southwest is ninety nine percent fraud ninety nine percent scam
[53:30.680 --> 53:35.120]  ninety nine percent joke chomping you just like turning your guns in and being trendy
[53:35.120 --> 53:40.000]  and being liberal and being politically correct or told do this you'll be accepted no do this
[53:40.000 --> 53:44.960]  you're not a human anymore you're not even real it's totalitarianism package this sicky
[53:44.960 --> 53:50.880]  sweet fake liberalism and by the way beards are in fashion now when i made the joke about
[53:50.880 --> 53:56.880]  different colored socks and beards it's like guys with tattoos and motorcycles i like tattoos
[53:56.880 --> 54:01.680]  i get them i like motorcycles most people on motorcycles with tattoos are really cool
[54:01.680 --> 54:05.360]  there's certain times that go out and get a bunch of tattoos in a motorcycle they're
[54:05.360 --> 54:11.160]  all had no cattle i'm not against a hat if you got cattle and you know what makes a man
[54:11.160 --> 54:16.240]  the beard or the man i've done it against beards you'll just see like 20 year old guys with
[54:16.240 --> 54:20.520]  a beard that look at you like you're not a man you don't have a beard it's like buddy
[54:20.520 --> 54:26.320]  i could have a big old blonde red beard if i wanted one i don't have one because it makes
[54:26.320 --> 54:32.560]  my face scratch and you know the ladies don't like it but but but it's it's the fat i don't
[54:32.560 --> 54:38.160]  like about the beards that it's a system driven cheekiness put out by the liberals that then
[54:38.160 --> 54:46.400]  everybody adopts and then it's these these these these these anti-male effeminate men
[54:46.400 --> 54:50.800]  with beards and big mustaches they look at you like you're naked because you don't have one
[54:50.800 --> 54:57.360]  and it's like hey dude i can break people's necks i can wage war against tyranny i earn
[54:57.360 --> 55:03.040]  my bones a hundred times a hundred different ways you don't even know what planet i'm on
[55:04.880 --> 55:08.320]  i can grow a big mustache and put grease on the end of it and i got a lot of friends that

[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:14.480]  with some news that's extremely important first in fact let's just get into this stack
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:23.280]  usda reports a virulent strain of avian flu in kansas poultry the problem is
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:30.960]  this strain can jump into humans or similar strains have and they're extremely lethal
[01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:37.760]  but if there is ever a bird flu outbreak they'll just cover it up i mean i have more articles
[01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:44.320]  today about more abola cases more science is coming in with abola more cover ups the media
[01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:49.120]  has even said forbes and others but they were ordered out to report on abola cases in the us
[01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:54.240]  so i don't know how bad it is but out of sight out of mind it's kind of like the borders are
[01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:58.880]  completely wide open and for six months we didn't even know it until border patrol tolls we went down
[01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:03.360]  video taped it and again i always use that as an example they can do that they can do anything
[01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:09.520]  the u.s department of agriculture has confirmed an infection of a virulent strain of avian flu
[01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:14.640]  in poultry in kansas the first case in the migratory bird route that runs through the center of the
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:21.040]  country the usd identified h5 into the flu strain in the backyard chicken and duck flock
[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:25.840]  in leavenworth county kansas according to a statement issued on friday it is the first
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:31.360]  case in the central flyaway migration route which stretches north south from montana to texas
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:39.360]  the same strain of the virus which is deadly in poultry has been found at commercial turkey farms
[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:44.240]  in minnesota missouri and arkansas they line a neighboring migratory route called the mississippi
[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:52.880]  flyway here's another one out of roiders as well us bird experts mystified by midwest avian flu
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:57.440]  spread a virulent strain of avian flu has killed turkeys in the heart of the nation's poultry
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:03.200]  region has been found through molecular testing to be nearly identical to viruses isolated in
[01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:07.920]  migratory ducks but some wildlife experts are skeptical of suggestions that wild birds
[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:13.520]  are responsible for spreading the h5 into strain that is infected poultry the top investigator for
[01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:18.640]  the u.s department of agriculture says the testing performed by government supports the
[01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:22.720]  conclusion the virus is being carried by waterfowl along the established migratory route
[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:32.480]  that stretches from minnesota the gulf of mexico yeah i remember a real false flag back in what
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:39.440]  was 2000 2001 with the footmouth that was a weaponized strain it popped up in like i forget
[01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:47.200]  like 50 something different areas from scotland to southern england it popped up everywhere
[01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:53.680]  and it popped up the same week and i said clearly footmouth looking at how it spread
[01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:58.160]  and the high kill rate this is having this is weaponized well it turned out they said an
[01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:01.840]  environmental activist working at a lab had gotten it out and spread it with cohorts but
[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:05.520]  then nobody got in trouble that's a cover folks they were going after rural communities trying
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:12.400]  to pass draconian laws and i don't know if this is that but a lot of the experts when you read on
[01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:16.880]  or saying this is popping up all over the country and it's the same strain and it's not even in
[01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:23.280]  migratory routes this one is and this doesn't add up well we see a lot of industrial espionage
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:26.800]  and it could be done by weirdo environmental groups or foreign governments or criminal groups
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:32.720]  in our government when people say are you against the government i'm against how our government is
[01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:38.320]  just this wide open interface for corporations and other governments to create their own fifth
[01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:43.920]  columns inside of it and and and screw over the public i mean isn't the government coming out
[01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:50.160]  with tv's that watch and listen to you well yeah government has let it happen but it's beyond that
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:55.760]  it's a corporate conspiracy against humanity and against free market against choice against free

[01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:26.720]  four to six p.m central i'm your host alex jones thank you for joining us coming up at the bottom
[01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:31.040]  of the hour because it ties into what's happening with south by southwest and a lot of other issues
[01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:36.960]  the legal case against internet rules and why the hill experts who've talked to a bunch of experts
[01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:44.800]  believe that the law well it's not a law that the regulations put forward outside of law are
[01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:49.040]  basically illegal and we're not done properly exactly what i've been saying but now we've
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:53.680]  had time to look over what's in this and i was having arguments with people last night
[01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:58.000]  i was saying listen there was a threat of big corporations to try to take over the internet
[01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:05.040]  and in that neutrality but out of that fear the FCC power grabbed it and a lot of the same
[01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:10.480]  corporations will now go in to this whole regulatory nightmare where the FCC now claims
[01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:14.960]  jurisdiction over it and you will see not just what they've currently done but a bunch of other
[01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:20.000]  laws and regulations coming out within that framework to start chopping up the internet
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:26.960]  taxing it and tracking it which is in the actual document that i covered on friday in detail it's
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:34.080]  400 pages not 330 something like we were told and it is a bloody nightmare that video is up on
[01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:42.640]  info wars dot com it's titled confirmed FCC takeover of the internet and the FCC is an agency
[01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:47.280]  that i've been on air 20 years i've seen people deal with them they put eas kill switches and
[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:51.520]  all your broadcast systems there's an obama kill switch a government kill switch in the internet
[01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:57.120]  now i mean this is the takeover folks i'm going to say this real slow barack obama and hillary
[01:08:57.120 --> 01:09:02.640]  clinton are both for this power grab the republican leadership could have stood in the way and said
[01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:07.760]  we make the laws they didn't now the republican leadership and the democratic leadership like it
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:13.760]  do when they're run by the big globalist consolidators do you think it's good oh but you
[01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:17.360]  heard obama care was going to give you something free or a lottery ticket was going to give you
[01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:23.040]  something for free all the immigrants coming here the magnet unlimited numbers i mean it's
[01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:28.320]  millions every few months now and the government keeps those numbers secret but as admitted recently
[01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:32.480]  there's something like 40 million illegals they're getting ready to legalize came out in the news
[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:37.440]  last year senator sessions released it they're preparing 40 million green cards more than
[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:43.440]  the populations of three central american countries i remember that headline in fact
[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:50.480]  typed that in it was guatemal and two others the i think it was politico it was uh government
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:56.240]  prepares more green cards than in three central american countries and then it listed them 40
[01:09:56.240 --> 01:10:02.320]  million it was in the news last week that the illegals are going to get social security cards
[01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:08.720]  in 2016 just oh you want driver's license here it is go vote and i'm not against these people except
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:12.720]  it's a globalist plan to get them here with the freebies then change the laws take those away
[01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:18.000]  there it is obama administration quietly prepares a surge of millions of new immigrant ids that's
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:25.520]  bright bar but the one i saw was just incredible so that's coming up and that ties in to south by
[01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:39.360]  southwest i've lived in austin for 23 years my mother's from austin her parents are here or
[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:50.240]  my grandfather's dead my grandmother's hanging on tough lady and i've seen south by southwest
[01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:56.480]  from its infancy was it 26 27 years old i forget all give me a wikipedia on him began plays i know
[01:10:56.480 --> 01:11:05.440]  who started it louis black fake name whatever not the comedian guys got a major axe to grind
[01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:10.080]  make stuff about me constantly if i wanted to sue him i could many times over but that's
[01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:14.640]  i know he listens because he writes about me almost every week attacking me and making up more garbage
[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:23.360]  but long story short he takes the david cross approach the big comedian who made a movie saying
[01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:27.600]  that i hate jews and black people you know what he apologized to us this weekend we're gonna see
[01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:31.840]  if we can get him on the show because he knows that's a load of bull he said his his supporters are
[01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:42.560]  chewing him up looks like it was 28 years ago it was 28 years ago it was founded so 28 years ago
[01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:46.400]  was founded so so i was here from the infancy when it was like rick link letter and people like
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:51.440]  that it was true underground films making it into the big time giving them a national platform it was
[01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:56.480]  musicians getting a national platform it was it was interesting and so the people that started
[01:11:56.480 --> 01:12:00.720]  i think you know did something interesting did something that's laudable i can say that a louis
[01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:06.320]  black owner of the chronicle but see i live here so i know the inside behind the scenes baseball
[01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:14.000]  i know that if you own a coffee shop in south austin because i had my office next door to him
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:19.120]  down on mary street that they would actually send people from south by southwest that work
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:26.320]  for it threatening them with lawsuits you name it or worse and then the cops would show up over
[01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:31.040]  music but south by southwest can blare it at any octave at once and they would shut it down i know
[01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:36.720]  filmmakers uh that would set up their own film festival to blow up screen in a deal and then
[01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:42.480]  they would do the same thing so a lot of what i would like into gangsterish uh underhanded
[01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:47.600]  anti-free markets type activities we're going to go to break and come back with your calls on this
[01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:56.960]  subject and then last year i had a crew out handing out free magazines in fours magazines
[01:12:56.960 --> 01:13:02.400]  i had a street team paid him like five thousand dollars the team like six seven people over three
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:08.800]  days to hand out 20 000 magazines first of them be five thousand then i expanded it and shot by
[01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:13.280]  southwest complained they admitted it and sent out code enforcers to say you can't hand out stuff
[01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:18.160]  in america so see i'm not going to spend all day on this it isn't about me being violated by these
[01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:24.640]  people it's about the fact that it's gone from being something that was grassroots to now one of
[01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:30.400]  the biggest if not the biggest interactive music film conferences in the world because it
[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:37.360]  it combines all three to a case where a hundred thousand plus people show up and i was downtown
[01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:44.960]  today i stay downtown part of the time and i sit and i watch these people desperately
[01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:50.480]  with all the money they've got and i talk to them like that's a video warning the average
[01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:57.920]  south by southwest mark of what's happening hey south by southwest chump target you know who
[01:13:57.920 --> 01:14:02.400]  muggers in new york parking at a out-of-towner woman generally and they jump on you from a
[01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:06.880]  high slammer had the concrete and rob you three thugs well this is just a more sophisticated
[01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:11.600]  form of that in my opinion in my view and so all they do is they advertise this is where you
[01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:22.080]  strike it rich why they found all sorts of goodies in the hills uh of california and
[01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:27.680]  then everybody rushes out there for a gold rush this is the exact type of garbage that we've seen
[01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:38.080]  over and over again now continuing it's that lottery ticket gold rush mindless mentality
[01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:45.200]  that i see the globalist with feminism and political correctness and college i shouldn't
[01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:49.920]  really be singling out south by southwest because they just follow the rest of the
[01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:56.320]  hollywood model in fact here's my best analogy or best allegory or parallel to what's happening
[01:14:56.320 --> 01:15:01.440]  in south by southwest if i was out in la and saw greyhound buses show up every day and
[01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:07.040]  documentaries been made about this of 18 year old beauty queens who can't be cheerleaders anymore
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:10.560]  but they nearby to smile and look at them that they think they're all gonna be movie stars
[01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:18.640]  within one week they are in hardcore porn or they're pimping on the street being pimped out on
[01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:24.800]  the street and it's the exact same thing colleges that i mean when i talked about this 15 years ago
[01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:28.480]  people didn't believe me now it's all over the news that most degrees are worthless unless you
[01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:32.000]  want a giant student debt you're gonna be bagging groceries or being a waitress for a waiter for
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:38.240]  the rest of your life but all those people dream of being big movie stars or musicians that's why
[01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:42.320]  every waiter is going to be a movie star or a musician and every grocery bagger is going to be
[01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:48.160]  a movie star now now now those are the want to be white collar ones whose parents were white collar
[01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:52.320]  who are now going below blue collar because they went and got the degree and bought into the system
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:56.480]  i'm going to break down the heart of south by southwest the scam when we come back

[01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:25.040]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:33.040]  well we've got four or five dollars from austin but dozens of others from all over the world
[01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:39.200]  look i kind of tend to babble let me crystallize my problem with south by southwest and why it's
[01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:44.480]  important to you if you're listening in russia or china or mexico or antarctica for that matter
[01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:50.800]  it's fad driven propaganda where the system creates a big event because everybody obsessed with it
[01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:56.480]  and then puts cultural messages into it then they sell the idea that if you make a pilgrimage
[01:20:56.480 --> 01:21:03.200]  to the mecca of south by southwest or the mecca of ut or the mecca of penn state or the mecca
[01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:11.280]  of harvard or the uc berkeley that you're gonna get a career and a future out of that while the
[01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:15.600]  country's being shut down while the jobs are being shipped overseas and when you read the political
[01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:22.160]  think tank actuaries from 30 years ago and from a year ago they're following a set plan
[01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:26.720]  and a world's being built where you have no power where you are emasculated
[01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:34.080]  where you are dehumanized where you are not independent that's the name of this board game
[01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:40.080]  and south by southwest and just the last decade has turned into a bunch of desperate people it
[01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:46.080]  looks like a job fair walking around trying to get a job almost everyone and there's almost no
[01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:52.720]  local media almost no independent film almost no independent music it's just bigger and bigger acts
[01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:58.560]  you know 30 40 year old rock bands coming to town it's just turned into a big entertainment
[01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:05.680]  extravaganza but being sold as a shot for you to make it just like most the degrees are worthless
[01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:10.320]  so i'm gonna tell women something if you're driving on the road you're 19 you live in
[01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:15.760]  kansas city we're on in kansas city right now you're beautiful you want to be a movie star you read
[01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:19.920]  people magazine every day you don't feel like you have value if you don't go to la every guy tells
[01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:25.840]  you you're beautiful there are predators in los angeles and when you get there you're not going
[01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:30.560]  to get an actress job you might if you don't want to be a prostitute be a assistant to somebody
[01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:34.960]  and that's actually your best shot would be an assistant to somebody who's wealthy and then
[01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:38.880]  marry him and that's a very low probability just like every kid thinks they're going to be in the
[01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:47.040]  mba or the nfl it's a one out of 5 000 shot or more it's made up and they focus on things that
[01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:53.200]  aren't based on normal human activity if we went in the right direction there you could have a shot
[01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:58.800]  to be part of a space colony or you could have a shot to be part of a you know really dangerous
[01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:04.240]  undersea colony to be a true trailblazer or you could have a shot at i mean there's we don't even
[01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:09.680]  think in those directions because the elite don't want us thinking about autonomous drones
[01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:14.720]  they don't want us thinking about gmo and ai that's all they talk about you just go watch
[01:23:14.720 --> 01:23:20.080]  your football and go to your south by southwest and act trendy while the government and corporations
[01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:24.880]  are about in their own words 30 to 40 years advanced the technology they even let us know they have
[01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:30.560]  so see i'm into the real world and nico you were popping in we were talking during the break
[01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:35.360]  you've been here 10 years what's your view on south by southwest nico acosta here in the studio
[01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:42.080]  when i got here about 10 years ago it used to be a lot of fun there was an energy in the air
[01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:47.200]  that was sort of intoxicating and it's not really here nowadays it's just so commercialized it
[01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:51.680]  actually makes me sick to be in that environment now and it used to be my highlight of the every year
[01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:57.440]  exactly and it's all these wannabe guys in suits with sunglasses ongoing
[01:23:57.440 --> 01:24:01.120]  i got a major deal yeah we'll make the deal right now in front of groups of people
[01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:05.440]  it's just like la you go out there it's meeting after meeting and everybody's
[01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:10.640]  going to be a big star and this project's going to get made and 99.99 percent of the time nothing
[01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:16.000]  happens or even if you do a project then the people screw you out of the money uh and believe
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:20.560]  me folks i've been involved in it i know and then now la's collapsing in the words of their
[01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:25.840]  mayor two years ago they are quote collapsing that whole old system is collapsing and they're all
[01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:33.200]  running here and i'm just being invaded by drooling desperate trendies all running around with
[01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:39.680]  narcissistic smiles on their faces vampires can't get blood from each other and i think about
[01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:44.320]  their worst and lottery ticket buyers they're you know they're worse than the young girls that
[01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:49.120]  travel out to la i think they're gonna be movie stars and i guess they do end up being stars
[01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:54.000]  getting a thousand dollars a scene you know that's what's incredible is that prostitutes a street
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:25:02.480]  hooker makes more than a porn star now but see they call it a star a star you tell somebody
[01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:08.560]  they're a star you're a star you don't want to be married and have kids you're a star you like
[01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:13.840]  obama you're part of the winning team this is what the fad mind control is all about i'm gonna put
[01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:20.800]  buckley ham in my cousin on the spot here he's a reporter but also uh out there running the
[01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:25.200]  board today coming in my one of our crews sick and buckley run over there the microphone and
[01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:30.800]  talk to us on air you've been living in austin 20 plus years just like i have in fact you lived
[01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:36.320]  down here about 25 years ago before i even got to austin 24 years ago what is your take on south
[01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:40.640]  by southwest i mean it's fine for us to hijack it i mean we're on drudge report we're all over
[01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:44.880]  the news we're getting millions extra views and listeners from it but we're but but we're there
[01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:49.760]  pimping the pimp we're there taking south by southwest the big corporations and burning their
[01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:55.280]  butt our reporters are out there flaming them and and just smashing them every day they want to stop
[01:25:55.280 --> 01:26:00.160]  us from handing out magazines or filming on the street how about you go to haiti's south by southwest
[01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:05.120]  wannabes go to north korea you vampires but see they want to be in austin they already sucked la
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:08.880]  drive they already sucked new york drive they already sucked down all these places so now
[01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:14.000]  they're coming to texas to raise our taxes that's another thing they collapse california and now
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:20.000]  they're here with carbon taxes and smart growth and all their inside jobs i'm sick of it you're a
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:25.840]  bunch of totalitarian snot noses buckley go ahead well i'd certainly would have to agree with nico
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:31.440]  that uh it's no longer a grassroots kind of a really creative circumstance where you get these
[01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:35.920]  you know amazing bands from norway that you've never heard of that you stumble into a into a
[01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:41.680]  little bar and you hear the most amazing music you ever heard it really not that so much more
[01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:47.360]  very very very corporate um and the second part that you kind of alluded to is it's really weird
[01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:52.000]  now because south by southwest has become this organization that kind of just takes over the
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:56.800]  town almost like a big parasite it comes in and all of a sudden their weird totalitarian rules
[01:26:56.800 --> 01:27:01.440]  about where you can go and what you can do that's been so influenced uh you know influences the local
[01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:06.240]  government and the police and everything else it becomes this almost like quasi sort of government
[01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:11.920]  system that descends upon the city and sort of uh you know changes the right of way on streets and
[01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:15.200]  uh see that's why you need to be on air buddy i'm trying to make you do that you've already been
[01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:20.960]  successful in tv radio filmmaking your own right i buckley moved to chicago 12 years i had to really
[01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:24.480]  really offer him a lot of money to even get him down here he was successful in his own right
[01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:30.000]  buckley helped me 23 years ago start the radio show he saw me for three years and and i wasn't
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:35.280]  successful through the corporate venue i had to create my own information platform my own films
[01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:40.480]  first and that's the thing you're not going to find success going to the big whorehouse southwest
[01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:46.080]  south by southwest you're going to have to create your own media system based on passion then people

[01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:37.600]  years they shut down hundreds of nice music venues saying sound ordinances because they were too loud
[01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:41.920]  because of quote downtown residences before there were any downtown residences now they built all

[01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:01.840]  i want to hear from austin collars i'm going to go to everybody but i want to hear specifically
[01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:11.920]  from people at south by southwest 5126461776 5126461776 i mean i saw mcdonald's out this
[01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:15.440]  morning at south by southwest so that they're covering it i got some video for a report the
[01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:22.880]  next few days i shot one and um they have these tubular backpacks on their backs handing out
[01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:27.200]  free mcdonald's coffee mcdonald's is collapsing right now i'm not just saying south by southwest
[01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:31.280]  will collapse i'm predicting it will collapse they've already dialed back a third from last year
[01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:37.520]  that was the beginning of the collapse you heard it here first in my view mcdonald's is collapsing
[01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:41.280]  that's in the news we told you years ago that was coming the people are waking up they had guys out
[01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:44.960]  handing out free coffee and then they would take a selfie with the person and tell them they were a
[01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:53.120]  star and posted on some mcdonald's website subsection like you're a starner and people are lining up
[01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:55.760]  that's their demographic though the general public like no way i don't want to be on the
[01:34:55.760 --> 01:35:02.640]  mcdonald's website like an idiot chump oh look i'm a movie star i'm my photos on a mcdonald's
[01:35:02.640 --> 01:35:08.080]  subpage somewhere with south by southwest nars this is they all line up around the block to do it
[01:35:09.520 --> 01:35:13.840]  that's what's sick okay i want to go to garith i want to go to the janitor i want to go to ronnie

[01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:25.200]  shut up just give me your point i'm moving the next person uh let's go ahead and talk to ronnie in
[01:35:25.200 --> 01:35:30.720]  austin texas go ahead you're on the air thank you sir this is based on my passion for dr
[01:35:30.720 --> 01:35:37.520]  ron paul and boycott south by southwest hey what a concept what happened to you just tell us okay my
[01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:44.960]  political rights to spread love for dr ron paul were denied to me outside but near their entrance
[01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:48.880]  i mean it wasn't oh i know no they had the police come over and they said mr jones we know it's not
[01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:52.880]  illegal for your career hand out magazines with south by southwest is threatening the city and
[01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:56.400]  in code inspectors and they're telling us and i said they're gonna arrest us and the cops said
[01:35:56.400 --> 01:36:00.960]  now i'm not gonna do it and the cops refused to follow the fake orders of the code inspector who
[01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:05.440]  was right there saying we couldn't hand out magazines i said i'm gonna sue all of you and the cops said
[01:36:05.440 --> 01:36:09.600]  we got it on video they said alice we're not doing it i mean that was two years ago no no that was
[01:36:09.600 --> 01:36:13.200]  last year i mean there's just no end to these people what did they do to you where were you ronnie
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:19.680]  well i was at the near the entrance to to the event but i was outside of it you know in the park
[01:36:19.680 --> 01:36:26.560]  so evidently just carrying a ron paul sign as i often do was reason enough for them to harass me
[01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:31.200]  and drive me illegally i mean now do they do they order the cops to do it because they're god
[01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:35.920]  they're south by southwest trendies or was it the trendy little little non-paid bots of south
[01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:42.240]  by southwest i think they were the bots i i'm they might have had some authority there's you
[01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:46.720]  know some uniform people there uh but ronnie i know this if somebody shows up at mine because
[01:36:46.720 --> 01:36:50.480]  they show up any media operation and say you're not allowed to operate in the city where don
[01:36:50.480 --> 01:36:54.640]  carlioni i mean if any mafia ever shows up here and tells me i can't operate they're gonna get a
[01:36:54.640 --> 01:37:00.320]  big problem i appreciate your call but see you don't recognize it because they're like trendy
[01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:09.600]  mafia let us have your speech don't be racist turning your guns in you can't have a music event
[01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:13.840]  anywhere in the city when we have it or we'll come after you we own everything we're god
[01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:18.320]  let's go ahead and talk to the janitor in femur region nine go ahead you're on the air
[01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:26.000]  go ahead janitor you're on the air worldwide fantastic there's a couple factors that you
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:30.000]  haven't been covering regarding the middle east in iran and i know this is uh deviating from
[01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:33.760]  yourself it's okay of course people dva just go ahead and get to it brother we're not screening
[01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:39.920]  your call uh mostly car talked about seven countries egypt iran syria iraq libya afghanistan
[01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:45.040]  the only two countries that stand basically are syria and iran biggest gas producer in the world
[01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:50.000]  the top two is russia and iran and they want to cut them off so they can cut off russia's
[01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:54.800]  applying europe and the rest of the world with the oil and gas no that's not that's not the case
[01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:59.280]  the reason why the new south stream happened is because it went through turkey and turkey is
[01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:02.800]  going to go through there and the second mass producer is iran which they have a pact that's
[01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:08.080]  going to run for the pipeline through kyrgyzstan or current iran no i know that was gas prom i mean
[01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:15.440]  in russia if you cut off the unical pipelines and things then the west won't control the shipments
[01:38:15.440 --> 01:38:21.280]  to china so they want to stop any russian pipelines in afghanistan and put in us pipelines then you're
[01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:27.040]  right they want turkey to get that uh gas that's there in the Mediterranean yes i mean of course
[01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:30.560]  there's so many facets to this how could you not cover them all there's only three countries this is
[01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:33.440]  the death of the petrol this is how it's going to happen there's three countries that benefit from
[01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:37.760]  iran becoming the darling of the united states because it uh that don't benefit this is israel
[01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:42.880]  turkey is out of iraq satirism israel on the bad side turkey's on the good side because they just get
[01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:47.680]  a pile of five hundred and some odd million dollars just for having to pipeline that's a big part of
[01:38:47.680 --> 01:38:51.360]  it you're right that's why they want to attack iran everybody knows iran already has news it's
[01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:55.920]  not about that it's about the stabilizing the region good to hear from you uh let's go ahead and
[01:38:55.920 --> 01:39:02.320]  talk to garth in san francisco on south by southwest go ahead you're on the air so me
[01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:09.120]  yes sir you're on the air oh good there's so much i want to talk about about south by southwest um
[01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:17.120]  no i'm limited on time but uh so i work in tech and i live in san francisco and i i see it a lot
[01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:23.840]  this just sycophantic you know sucking up to the whole tech industry and they put on events here
[01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:30.240]  that are sponsored by google microsoft facebook you know all the big tech companies so it's and
[01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:35.600]  what they the sick thing is that they call it uh community they call it the technology community
[01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:39.360]  but it's not community it's a big corporate event and the same thing is true you can go to south
[01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:45.440]  by southwest dot com and you can see the list of all the sponsors on on there you know and you've
[01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:52.240]  got mcdonald's which you had already mentioned earlier you've got your at&t pepsi um now switch
[01:39:52.240 --> 01:39:56.800]  over real quick to i want to cover the feminism thing so the feminism is tied in with it too because
[01:39:56.800 --> 01:40:00.800]  now they're trying to get more women in tech and if you see this whole big push for women in tech
[01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:04.480]  you haven't covered this on your show but there's a big push for women and others try to get women
[01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:09.440]  there's a push everywhere where if guys have degrees and better scores and work harder they
[01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:14.480]  don't care because men are inherently bad and we've got to get women in there to make sure again
[01:40:14.480 --> 01:40:20.240]  that it's the end of families the end of humanity it's a resource-based allocation to end humanity
[01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:24.560]  as we know it this goes back to the jaffy memo where they say encourage women to work it's the
[01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:28.320]  same god it's the same plan to get their taxes and break the family i've got nothing to do with
[01:40:28.320 --> 01:40:32.800]  empowering women right it's not and it's it's working it's totally working and they've got
[01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:36.640]  smart cities and they've got smart cities there they're trying to promote driverless that's right
[01:40:36.640 --> 01:40:42.240]  austin is piloting the driverless cars the tax by the mile uh and and now herds his announced
[01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:47.280]  cameras and their rent cars it's just crazy and then you tell these trendies hey you know this
[01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:51.520]  technocracy is being designed in a bad way and they say nothing will stop and google is taking
[01:40:51.520 --> 01:40:56.080]  over last year we had an interview i mean it's so cult-like yeah that's why i wanted to get on here
[01:40:56.080 --> 01:41:00.240]  because i'm in tech and i'm not and i don't want it to be like oh you know these rednecks versus all
[01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:04.000]  these tech guys because i'm in it i see it i've worked at companies that are doing things like
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:08.640]  this i'm like hey this is not a good product um but the other thing i really wanted to get on is
[01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:12.640]  i want to jump real quick because i know i'm living on times is the biotech and i don't know if you
[01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:17.120]  if you've noticed this or not but there was a woman from organic consumers who was actually banned
[01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:21.600]  from speaking there by the biotech industry organization who has a big influence at south
[01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:26.160]  by southwest which is now the big thing they're going to push GMOs because GMOs are going to stop
[01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:33.120]  global warming and it sounds nutty but glyphosate's good no no i'm aware i'm aware of the big push
[01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:38.560]  here at south by southwest to push a GMO and and and cancerate glyphosate and all the rest of it
[01:41:38.560 --> 01:41:42.480]  but but you're telling me where there's a news article that they banned a woman from speaking

[01:49:24.160 --> 01:49:31.360]  matt that's all we have time for uh let's go to page you're on the air hi alex um page from new york
[01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:38.080]  city i just i have a few points one is um you know i'm in new york city everyone's liberal here
[01:49:38.080 --> 01:49:44.560]  everybody buys into all the propaganda and i just feel like the east coast is completely void of any
[01:49:44.560 --> 01:49:49.840]  counter message and it almost seems like it's a lost car it's a cult until the governor says if
[01:49:49.840 --> 01:49:55.360]  your pro gun or pro life leave and they said you said he said leave that these are cult members and
[01:49:55.360 --> 01:50:03.120]  now they've collapsed their states and the and and now they're coming here to enslave me exactly and
[01:50:03.120 --> 01:50:10.480]  so um i was a pr director for a big company and i can tell you off air and so um i just think that
[01:50:10.480 --> 01:50:17.520]  what woke me up because i grew up in the city um and i working fashion is really 9 11 and i almost
[01:50:17.520 --> 01:50:23.360]  feel like that's the key that kind of is sparked you know this whole awareness of everything going
[01:50:23.360 --> 01:50:29.440]  on and especially for people on the east coast with the boston bombing it's really such common
[01:50:29.440 --> 01:50:35.840]  sense and people have over complicated it so much and you know especially with the cia coining the
[01:50:35.840 --> 01:50:42.720]  terms to fear fear it i think we need to make apparel and kind of go back to that old school
[01:50:42.720 --> 01:50:49.680]  you know uh mythology of you know making apparel making ads um because you know with the sqc right
[01:50:49.680 --> 01:50:53.840]  now they're about to see it over the internet with everything that they censor as it is what you're
[01:50:53.840 --> 01:50:59.840]  saying is what my mom says constantly culture is how we win making art is how we win we have to all
[01:50:59.840 --> 01:51:04.080]  become walking billboards for freedom and we will overturn the system and the reason they're trying
[01:51:04.080 --> 01:51:08.640]  to shut down the web and freedom is because we're winning on the gmo's and the life of states
[01:51:08.640 --> 01:51:13.280]  we mean every week major companies are pulling it like mcdonald's we're winning geopolitically
[01:51:13.280 --> 01:51:17.120]  you're right there's certain areas like the west coast and the east coast where they've
[01:51:17.120 --> 01:51:23.440]  really brainwashed people but still it's please continue as a pr person what is it like for
[01:51:23.440 --> 01:51:29.440]  you trained in all this to see it being used against the people it is so beyond frustrating that
[01:51:29.440 --> 01:51:35.040]  you know i was really big and i am really big in fashion and um you know it's so frustrating
[01:51:35.040 --> 01:51:40.480]  because i'm like in a space alien out here and you know people wanted to do bright manuscripts
[01:51:40.480 --> 01:51:46.000]  and screenplays of my life story i'm only 30 but you know it was until i realized just through
[01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:50.880]  you know different life hardships that you know i really want to have a purpose and this
[01:51:51.520 --> 01:51:57.040]  it was my calling it's trying to alert people but in a way that isn't you know where they're like
[01:51:57.040 --> 01:52:01.760]  you're a conspiracy theorist or they want to marginalize you sorry i'm in a pet store it's
[01:52:01.760 --> 01:52:07.360]  okay they want to marginalize you you know just for having a different view it's like they will not
[01:52:07.360 --> 01:52:12.880]  even accept you to the point where you know my twitter i can't um follow the people i want to
[01:52:12.880 --> 01:52:19.040]  follow just for business purposes you know it's become that crazy it's a cult political correctness
[01:52:19.040 --> 01:52:24.640]  is the opposite of liberalism real liberalism is jeffersonian and is wide open wild wild west
[01:52:24.640 --> 01:52:29.760]  but but you know what's amazing is that you as an insider are talking about the experiences you've
[01:52:29.760 --> 01:52:34.720]  gone through and people i talk to in hollywood you name it it's the same thing they are in a cult
[01:52:34.720 --> 01:52:39.040]  they want out of it so the good news is the general public may be dumbed down in certain
[01:52:39.040 --> 01:52:44.080]  areas but people inside the system really don't like having their free will taken away
[01:52:44.080 --> 01:52:48.880]  and it's so empowering once they start saying no to the system that it's infectious i think it's
[01:52:48.880 --> 01:52:53.360]  going to spread uh we'd love for you to do a interview with your face blacked out of you
[01:52:53.360 --> 01:52:57.600]  wanted to on skype you know pr insider speaks out or something if you'd like we'll put you
[01:52:57.600 --> 01:53:01.520]  on hold you can give us your name and number if you don't just hang up but we'd love to talk to
[01:53:01.520 --> 01:53:07.280]  you more god bless you page but there's so many people seeing pr that are on the inside that listen
[01:53:07.280 --> 01:53:13.040]  to my show about edward bernays and the cia and project mockingbird and coining the term in the
[01:53:13.040 --> 01:53:18.240]  60s conspiracy theorist these are smart people and they know we're not lying and they're like yeah
[01:53:18.240 --> 01:53:22.960]  this is really bad they just never thought about it we're just here not to tell you what to think
[01:53:22.960 --> 01:53:28.560]  but to get you to just go hey look around you is everything normal what you see going on here
[01:53:28.560 --> 01:53:34.400]  because it's not and then praying all these poor south by southwest people i've probably talked to
[01:53:34.400 --> 01:53:38.720]  50 of in the last few days and i'll go let me guess your college graduate can't get a job they're
[01:53:38.720 --> 01:53:41.760]  like yeah i got a huge student debt i'm just hoping to find something here that gets me ahead
[01:53:42.720 --> 01:53:49.040]  and it they have this this soul that's good that wants to be special and wants to take action
[01:53:49.040 --> 01:53:54.640]  because humanity is special but it's being manipulated by these globalists jay in new
[01:53:54.640 --> 01:54:00.960]  york thanks for holding you're on the year hey hey how you doing alex taking my call thank you
[01:54:00.960 --> 01:54:05.440]  i also i just wanted to say you have a you have a great set of pipes you are going to do this and
[01:54:06.960 --> 01:54:10.880]  yes i just wanted to get into a few things basically you know it's just like you said
[01:54:11.600 --> 01:54:17.280]  and it's even like people so dumbed down that's what it is it's but even with that like the nfl
[01:54:17.280 --> 01:54:24.000]  oh adrian peterson doesn't have an appeals process oh i'm so i'm like okay did you know that do you
[01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:28.560]  know what's going on with the internet right now did you know that you don't have an appeal process
[01:54:28.560 --> 01:54:32.480]  with your internet right now did you know that was taken over and people they don't you know they
[01:54:32.480 --> 01:54:36.640]  don't even want to deal with that they go i'll get out of here with that so you know that it's
[01:54:36.640 --> 01:54:40.800]  just irritating it's like you know people are so dumbed down and that's why people thank you alex
[01:54:40.800 --> 01:54:47.440]  because you give that history lesson these kids these people are being raised by dumbed down parents
[01:54:48.080 --> 01:54:54.000]  that don't know anything so the rancher good the rhetoric is good we love it and that the truth
[01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:59.280]  movement is what's trendy see that's what's trendy and people like madel and these different ones
[01:54:59.280 --> 01:55:03.760]  they want to be trendy and they want they want to take over the grassroots movement that's why
[01:55:03.760 --> 01:55:08.400]  they infiltrated any good you want as a host you should be a radio host you just said everything
[01:55:08.400 --> 01:55:14.320]  i wanted to say in two hours in 45 seconds that's it it's so frustrating that the tvs are watching
[01:55:14.320 --> 01:55:18.800]  us herds is putting cameras in they did just take over the internet you tell a trendy they just go
[01:55:18.800 --> 01:55:24.160]  oh and laugh at you because they don't know anything and their only response is to act cool
[01:55:24.160 --> 01:55:28.960]  so we have to just move on past these zombies and find people of every race color and creed and
[01:55:28.960 --> 01:55:35.120]  religion that understand we have an evil takeover happening we can come together with our choices
[01:55:35.120 --> 01:55:40.880]  and build our own culture that is so sexy compared to the ugly fake plastic culture
[01:55:40.880 --> 01:55:47.440]  being sold to us by madison avenue yes we're keeping track the bullet the bullet grab the
[01:55:47.440 --> 01:55:53.360]  trans-specific agreement uh you know everything done in secret the black sites the immigration
[01:55:53.360 --> 01:55:58.160]  all illegal all criminal but i just want to ask you one more thing did you see that talk show
[01:55:58.160 --> 01:56:04.080]  that uh that uh had the president on this week no see how he introduced them you didn't see that
[01:56:04.080 --> 01:56:10.640]  has uh the the gym guy introduced him as the first canyon born oh yeah we actually have that clip
[01:56:10.640 --> 01:56:15.360]  yeah they make a joke out of it that's funny right that's this is the united states of america but
[01:56:15.360 --> 01:56:20.800]  that's funny to introduce somebody that's trendy canyon but you're not a you're not a you're not a
[01:56:20.800 --> 01:56:24.560]  citizen of the united states but you get to be president like don't unfortunate it's a joke
[01:56:24.560 --> 01:56:29.440]  and now we learn it was a scyops scam to push us getting ready for foreign presidents when in truth
