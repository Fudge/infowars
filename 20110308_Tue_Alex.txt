[00:00.000 --> 00:12.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.160 --> 00:20.920]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.920 --> 00:31.800]  we are live my friends it is Tuesday the 8th day of March 2011 we're going to be
[00:31.800 --> 00:36.560]  live here for the next three hours and this is going to be an absolutely jam
[00:36.560 --> 00:46.320]  packed key key transmission Lord Christopher Monkton to join us coming up
[00:46.320 --> 00:51.960]  in about 20 minutes to break down the criminal activities of the big megabanks
[00:51.960 --> 00:57.640]  pushing the fake environmental global carbon tax movement and the open
[00:57.640 --> 01:04.280]  announcements in England that people will not have regular electricity to their
[01:04.280 --> 01:10.040]  homes and that this has to be done to save the earth from the evil carbon
[01:10.040 --> 01:16.560]  dioxide so the planned artificial scarcity the neo feudalistic serfdom we're
[01:16.560 --> 01:20.920]  going to be breaking that down with Lord Christopher Monkton coming up then
[01:20.920 --> 01:27.600]  Dr. Nick Begich when he was on with us a few months ago he said Alex you tend to
[01:27.600 --> 01:35.080]  focus on chemicals in food and water farm a key up to manipulate the human mind
[01:35.080 --> 01:39.680]  and he said certainly there's thousands of government documents on that front and
[01:39.680 --> 01:48.800]  we know that's going on but he said most of the funding and most the research is
[01:48.800 --> 01:56.080]  psychotronic deals with electronic different fields and since then I've
[01:56.080 --> 02:00.040]  read a lot of patents and even mainstream news articles where they admit not
[02:00.040 --> 02:05.320]  just the message in TV not just the overt propaganda not just the flicker
[02:05.320 --> 02:10.200]  rate that puts you into a mesmerized sleep type state where you're
[02:10.200 --> 02:17.240]  subconsciously accepting everything it cuts off the critical areas of the of
[02:17.240 --> 02:25.120]  the brain the left and right lobes of the cerebral cortex but actual programming
[02:25.120 --> 02:34.120]  directly into the lower centers of the brain breathing eating sex drive all of
[02:34.120 --> 02:40.240]  it that they can actually program it they can kill you now with the television
[02:40.240 --> 02:47.320]  set these are patented they can if they want to folks they can kill you with a
[02:47.320 --> 02:57.480]  television set kill you let me say it again kill you you remember about 12
[02:57.480 --> 03:03.720]  years ago tens of thousands of Japanese children went into convulsions all over
[03:03.720 --> 03:07.160]  the country when an episode of Pokemon aired that they later admitted was a
[03:07.160 --> 03:19.560]  quote test of the flashing strobe just with a strobe timed to the child level
[03:19.560 --> 03:27.840]  algorithms of the brain they were able to cause convulsions tens of thousands
[03:27.840 --> 03:32.520]  boom as it air simultaneously falling out of their chairs now if you know these
[03:32.520 --> 03:38.360]  these systems exist which they do the question is will the globalist use it
[03:38.360 --> 03:43.920]  well you know their motto an unused weapon is a useless weapon and you're
[03:43.920 --> 03:48.680]  thinking well I'll just turn the television set off oh I'm sorry they
[03:48.680 --> 03:53.000]  can do it through fluorescent light bulbs that's why under law they're banning
[03:53.000 --> 03:56.840]  all the phosphorescent and phasing them out the next three years the bands began
[03:56.840 --> 04:02.880]  this year of the higher watts down they're gonna be able to mind control us
[04:02.880 --> 04:07.640]  with the street lights mind folks how many things have you tuned into and laughed
[04:07.640 --> 04:11.760]  at years later its mainstream news kind of like I told you 15 years ago they're
[04:11.760 --> 04:16.280]  taking all babies blood at birth and putting it in the secret DNA database
[04:16.280 --> 04:20.120]  with the Pentagon for bio weapons now that's all been declassified in the last
[04:20.120 --> 04:24.240]  12 months of course we had the documents you didn't listen to us when we had them
[04:24.240 --> 04:28.960]  I have all the different patents that's not true there are so many thousands
[04:28.960 --> 04:36.080]  that I don't have them all I've read hundreds where they can kill you and by
[04:36.080 --> 04:42.280]  the way you can't even tell the light is flashing it does it at a certain rate
[04:42.280 --> 04:47.080]  and they know how to exactly program the brain you know where they're putting
[04:47.080 --> 04:50.920]  them in first government buildings because they're not gonna kill their
[04:50.920 --> 04:55.120]  zombies up front they're gonna brainwash him and get him ready for the evil work
[04:55.120 --> 05:00.720]  they're doing as they're in sleepwalking trances an army of zombies
[05:00.720 --> 05:05.680]  Alex has told you that the mid-east uprisings over food prices and shortages
[05:05.680 --> 05:09.720]  caused by fuel costs are spreading worldwide we're seeing the impact right
[05:09.720 --> 05:13.520]  here in the United States ethanol that was supposed to reduce petroleum use
[05:13.520 --> 05:18.520]  and fuel prices hit a 30 month high in February and pump prices are expected to
[05:18.520 --> 05:23.160]  reach $5 a gallon because of shipping costs food is being priced out of the
[05:23.160 --> 05:27.960]  reach of millions of Americans with an expected 35% jump in the next 60 days
[05:27.960 --> 05:32.240]  move quickly while you could still afford it and e-foods direct will pay your

[06:12.880 --> 06:16.200]  children and even how you take care of your health and your own family now
[06:16.200 --> 06:19.600]  this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years the crazy
[06:19.600 --> 06:24.040]  part is he's usually right you see he predicted the collapse of GM Panny
[06:24.040 --> 06:27.720]  May Freddie Mac and America's biggest mall owner general growth properties in
[06:27.720 --> 06:32.400]  fact Barron's called his work a dire prophecy recently he created a video
[06:32.400 --> 06:35.480]  which you can watch online for free detailing his biggest and most
[06:35.480 --> 06:39.320]  important prediction yet and it's a real eye-opener I can't stress this
[06:39.320 --> 06:42.960]  enough you should at least watch this free video online today he explains

[07:03.720 --> 07:08.000]  about the Silver Lungs Generator now you can produce pure and endless colloidal
[07:08.000 --> 07:12.320]  silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing
[07:12.320 --> 07:16.120]  the solution through the lungs the respiratory system is the first line
[07:16.120 --> 07:20.160]  of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses the Silver Lungs Generator
[07:20.160 --> 07:24.960]  infuses the respiratory system with yourself produced nano silver solutions
[07:24.960 --> 07:29.320]  and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the
[07:29.320 --> 07:33.560]  bloodstream with continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver
[07:33.560 --> 07:38.640]  products you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver
[07:38.640 --> 07:43.080]  Lungs Generator very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided
[07:43.080 --> 07:49.680]  making production fast and simple go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn
[07:49.680 --> 07:53.040]  more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator that's
[07:53.040 --> 07:57.640]  www.silverlungs.com
[07:57.640 --> 08:08.280]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:13.840 --> 08:19.440]  we have a very important radio broadcast lined up for you today it is of
[08:19.440 --> 08:25.920]  course Tuesday the 8th of March 2011 hard to believe we're already in the
[08:25.920 --> 08:34.080]  third month of 2011 steaming quickly towards 2012 coming up in the next
[08:34.080 --> 08:41.280]  hour Dr. Nick Begich who is one of the leading experts on psychotronic
[08:41.280 --> 08:47.040]  mind control systems will be joining us and the reason I have him coming on is
[08:47.040 --> 08:52.640]  I'm seeing more and more mainstream news articles and admitting that television
[08:52.640 --> 08:59.160]  can actually not just put you into a highly suggestible dream state so that
[08:59.160 --> 09:05.480]  you accept the verbal and visual propaganda being fed to you but that it
[09:05.480 --> 09:12.120]  can actually even affect your health your wellness with encoded digital
[09:12.120 --> 09:19.560]  messages within the transmission itself and now they're shifting over to
[09:19.560 --> 09:24.480]  phosphorescent bulbs to the fluorescent bulbs and admitting that the
[09:24.480 --> 09:29.320]  government's going to have data transmission over the light bulbs in
[09:29.320 --> 09:31.920]  your house that's why they're making it the law all over the world that you've
[09:31.920 --> 09:37.360]  got to have the fluorescence no more phosphorescent because now this is
[09:37.360 --> 09:41.840]  rolling into government buildings from Texas to Minnesota the light bulbs are
[09:41.840 --> 09:48.000]  quote communicating with the computers and security systems in the building at
[09:48.000 --> 09:54.920]  ultra-fast wavelength levels flickering on and off that the human eye cannot
[09:54.920 --> 10:02.040]  consciously perceive and under those very patents you find the sub patents for
[10:02.040 --> 10:09.640]  mind control and causing physiological developments in the human body and of
[10:09.640 --> 10:14.080]  this of course ties into things like smart meters five six years ago they
[10:14.080 --> 10:18.360]  announced in San Francisco as the beta test where they're totally liberal totally
[10:18.360 --> 10:22.040]  trendy they would slit their throats have told it was liberal they would
[10:22.040 --> 10:25.320]  throw their children into meat grinders if they were told it was liberal they're
[10:25.320 --> 10:29.440]  told it's liberal the government's going to remote control your thermostat it's
[10:29.440 --> 10:34.520]  going to cut back on carbon and then folks read the actual documents and we
[10:34.520 --> 10:37.880]  said well wait a minute you say you're going to control our thermostat with
[10:37.880 --> 10:42.520]  this and decide when we have power and they said no we're not and then a few
[10:42.520 --> 10:48.200]  years later you bet we are and you don't have a choice during peak times we're
[10:48.200 --> 10:52.080]  going to cut your air conditioner on or off cut your heat on or off then they
[10:52.080 --> 10:55.760]  said oh actually just to cut your carbon footprint we're going to lower it
[10:55.760 --> 10:59.880]  anyways or if we see that there's too much you're spending charge you more
[10:59.880 --> 11:06.000]  it's all about artificial scarcity it's all about taking things and
[11:06.000 --> 11:11.640]  infrastructure that we've built and then raping you squeezing you by these
[11:11.640 --> 11:20.440]  consolidated elite cartels and it's about all the new under federal regulations
[11:20.440 --> 11:26.640]  it's the same in many other first world nations the dishwashers the clothes
[11:26.640 --> 11:36.760]  washers the entertainment centers the refrigerators everything is tracking and
[11:36.760 --> 11:42.360]  tracing what you buy what you sell what you do the new refrigerators track and
[11:42.360 --> 11:48.880]  read all the RFID on the product the TVO the cable tracks what you watch and
[11:48.880 --> 11:53.840]  creates a psychological algorithm and tracks you what ads you watch they have
[11:53.840 --> 11:58.880]  built-in microphones and cameras on the kinetic Microsoft video game system that
[11:58.880 --> 12:02.800]  face scans you and can record up to seven different people's voices in real
[12:02.800 --> 12:07.720]  time I mean they're just rolling big brother out just like the cell phones
[12:07.720 --> 12:13.960]  under federal law 1996 track us all in real time via GPS and they can dial in
[12:13.960 --> 12:18.200]  even when the phones turned off and listen to you and of course we were
[12:18.200 --> 12:23.400]  cookie to tell you that in 96 because we had the telecommunications act but
[12:23.400 --> 12:29.160]  people didn't want to listen and then by about 2003 Fox News and others said big
[12:29.160 --> 12:32.840]  brother eat your heart out the government's listening to everything you
[12:32.840 --> 12:38.280]  do with AI computers no warrants and it's good hey schools all over the
[12:38.280 --> 12:45.840]  country from Philadelphia to Sacramento from California to Pennsylvania the
[12:45.840 --> 12:50.000]  schools are watching you at home on your laptop in the shower and the school
[12:50.000 --> 12:54.320]  told on themselves they're proud of it and the court said go ahead and do it
[12:54.320 --> 12:59.320]  haha we're gonna take your baby's blood we're gonna put telescreens up in the
[12:59.320 --> 13:04.480]  Walmart's and at 9,000 other locations the TSA is gonna be at train stations
[13:04.480 --> 13:07.840]  bus stations and highway checkpoints the police are gonna take your blood
[13:07.840 --> 13:14.040]  without warrants the ATF's gonna order gun shops to register people even though
[13:14.040 --> 13:19.960]  they're not supposed to there's no law they're just gonna do it and why are
[13:19.960 --> 13:25.880]  they so confident because they've got the high def TV with scientific patents
[13:25.880 --> 13:34.360]  to literally be able to program your brain like you program a vcr to be able
[13:34.360 --> 13:39.120]  to program everything you're doing that's why they're so confident we've
[13:39.120 --> 13:44.000]  taken the bait of the iPads and the iPhones and the whole system humanity
[13:44.000 --> 13:49.600]  is being absorbed by the technocracy the globalists have engineered the sixth
[13:49.600 --> 13:56.680]  great extinction they're heralding it now we are now entering the vortex you
[13:56.680 --> 14:03.600]  have been warned you've got the average person out there operating at a caveman
[14:03.600 --> 14:14.320]  level intellect facing globalist 21st century mind control and if people won't
[14:14.320 --> 14:18.600]  even admit they're under psychological warfare attack how are they going to
[14:18.600 --> 14:25.520]  admit that they're under psychotronic attack let me explain to you there are
[14:25.520 --> 14:30.200]  hundreds and hundreds of patents I've read there are thousands on record there
[14:30.200 --> 14:34.440]  are hundreds and hundreds of mainstream news articles going back decades where
[14:34.440 --> 14:37.840]  DARPA comes out and says yeah we're testing towers and major cities that
[14:37.840 --> 14:42.840]  will calm you during emergencies with different wavelengths to calm and soothe
[14:42.840 --> 14:47.200]  the public we're already under this folks that's why your neighbors are in a
[14:47.200 --> 14:54.200]  trance it was on record when TV was first rolled out in the 40s that after a
[14:54.200 --> 14:58.080]  few minutes of watching TV the first time you watch television it takes on
[14:58.080 --> 15:02.360]  average about an hour in the major studies that you can pull up online for
[15:02.360 --> 15:07.560]  someone to have suspended disbelief after someone has had suspended disbelief
[15:07.560 --> 15:18.920]  one time it takes on average about two minutes the eyes are a are a electro
[15:18.920 --> 15:27.000]  chemical coupler your eyes are the window to your mind your soul your eyes
[15:27.000 --> 15:35.520]  are the electrochemical receiver cup couplers just like you have infrared
[15:35.520 --> 15:38.960]  systems they can transmit data over just like they have light bulbs now that
[15:38.960 --> 15:43.520]  communicate with your computers that's what your eyes are doing they're there
[15:43.520 --> 15:48.880]  they're receivers their stocks when you're in your embryonic development just
[15:48.880 --> 15:54.120]  a few weeks into development from the back of the brain grows the eye stocks
[15:54.120 --> 15:58.680]  in fact your eyes are brain tissue ladies and gentlemen you're looking at
[15:58.680 --> 16:03.800]  someone's eyes you're looking at their brain you're looking into my eyes right
[16:03.800 --> 16:10.240]  now you're looking at Alex Jones's brain my my my my most important sense my
[16:10.240 --> 16:15.400]  brain looking right at you your brain looking right back at me right now now
[16:15.400 --> 16:20.520]  you're not just looking at the image and and and the audio of what I'm saying
[16:20.520 --> 16:26.200]  and doing your body is picking up the body language it's picking up the tones
[16:26.200 --> 16:30.880]  it's picking up from an instinctive level whether you think I'm telling the
[16:30.880 --> 16:36.000]  truth or not you're intellectually also scanning for data you have to see if it
[16:36.000 --> 16:41.240]  compares and matches what I'm saying but the globalist can now trump all of
[16:41.240 --> 16:48.640]  that they can feed through even though I'm sending out a clear signal they can
[16:48.640 --> 16:52.960]  feed over the broadcast or transmission signal after they get my original
[16:52.960 --> 17:04.520]  signal the video stream we're sending out they can add magnetic light energy in
[17:04.520 --> 17:09.080]  the patents there's three different ways to do it they could embed it to make you
[17:09.080 --> 17:14.600]  docile to make you hungry to make you angry to make you be sexually aroused to
[17:14.600 --> 17:19.720]  make you go into a deeper sleep state and they can even ratchet down your sleep
[17:19.720 --> 17:26.480]  state until you go into a oxygen deprivation zone of deep sleep which
[17:26.480 --> 17:31.960]  is near death and can even put you into death
[17:34.160 --> 17:42.280]  you understand that we're being hit by mega 21st century advanced technology
[17:42.280 --> 17:45.400]  that's why the globalists don't care what we think anymore that's why they
[17:45.400 --> 17:50.840]  don't care about Alex Jones they know the average yuppie watching this is just
[17:50.840 --> 18:00.240]  going to laugh is totally defenseless we've got to have debates about this and
[18:00.240 --> 18:02.600]  what we're going to do in the future and how we're going to respond to this
[18:02.600 --> 18:07.800]  because this is all real this is happening now in another issue because
[18:07.800 --> 18:10.280]  we don't normally have guests on the first hour but the only time we could
[18:10.280 --> 18:13.440]  have him is in the first hour Lord Moncton's coming on about some issues
[18:13.440 --> 18:18.360]  that connect in with all of this then we've got the whole mind control
[18:18.360 --> 18:24.160]  psychotronic lightwave electromagnetic manipulation of the mind coming up in
[18:24.160 --> 18:29.760]  the second hour the third hour is going to be absolutely paramount important

[24:16.720 --> 24:23.480]  joining us then I'll get into the third hour these Wisconsin protesters on video
[24:23.480 --> 24:27.800]  saying you have no right to your money they they actually believe it and if you
[24:27.800 --> 24:30.880]  don't think that means you're a slave it means they'll put you in a forced labor
[24:30.880 --> 24:35.640]  camp I mean these are the heirs of Stalin but we're gonna look at the other
[24:35.640 --> 24:39.560]  end of that that you have the big corrupt multinational banks that nobody
[24:39.560 --> 24:42.960]  wants to talk about so we're gonna be discussing that in the third hour today
[24:42.960 --> 24:47.200]  after Dr. Nick Meggich joins us Lord Christopher Monkton third Viscount of
[24:47.200 --> 24:51.920]  Monkton and Brentially formerly a member of the conservative party Monkton has
[24:51.920 --> 24:55.800]  been the deputy leader of the UK Independence Party since 2010 he
[24:55.800 --> 25:01.040]  served in a conservative central office and work with Margaret Thatcher at
[25:01.040 --> 25:05.160]  number 10 and policy unit advising her he's also an award-winning journalist
[25:05.160 --> 25:10.480]  and scientist who's also an inventor and the website is science and public
[25:10.480 --> 25:14.440]  policy dot org really doesn't need any introduction we only have him for about
[25:14.440 --> 25:19.920]  30 minutes so in the interest of time Lord Monkton we now see the head of the
[25:19.920 --> 25:26.720]  Goddard Space Center we see Bert we see Maury Strong we see Ted Turner they all
[25:26.720 --> 25:31.400]  say we want a post-industrial world but China can build three to five new power
[25:31.400 --> 25:39.600]  plants a week Obama won't let any new ones open here and now I have the article
[25:39.600 --> 25:44.280]  out of the Daily Telegraph era of constant electricity at home is ending
[25:44.280 --> 25:50.800]  says power chief and he says that it's true that if that it's good that England
[25:50.800 --> 25:55.080]  will be like North Korea in the next 10 years and that you won't have power a lot
[25:55.080 --> 26:00.920]  of the time but that's good to cut your your carbon footprint it's just a
[26:00.920 --> 26:07.680]  pathetic how the entire governing class has become infected with what really one
[26:07.680 --> 26:13.920]  can only call a sort of post-Marxist desperation they are longing to shut down
[26:13.920 --> 26:17.920]  the economies of the West and when the likes of you and me Alex began saying
[26:17.920 --> 26:22.800]  this that this was their real agenda we were told we were extremists we were
[26:22.800 --> 26:25.400]  lunatics we were frothing at the mouth we didn't know what we're talking about
[26:25.400 --> 26:31.040]  now they're coming out more and more openly and saying it publicly and
[26:31.040 --> 26:36.080]  instead of the wall-to-wall outrage that ought to be happening people are just
[26:36.080 --> 26:39.680]  saying yes we got used to these people they say this sort of thing perhaps
[26:39.680 --> 26:43.720]  they don't really mean it just the same kind of rabbit in the headlights
[26:43.720 --> 26:48.480]  response as we saw in the run-up to Hitler when he began saying similar
[26:48.480 --> 26:52.320]  extraordinary things and people just quietly looked the other way and said
[26:52.320 --> 26:56.520]  well let's all be nice to him and hope that he goes away the fact is we can't
[26:56.520 --> 27:01.760]  allow these people any longer to get away with what they're getting away with
[27:01.760 --> 27:07.840]  what they're doing is exploiting our democratic tolerance and understanding
[27:07.840 --> 27:12.800]  in the hope that they can destroy it forever and shut it down and put in its
[27:12.800 --> 27:16.880]  place something a great deal more authoritarian let me give you first of
[27:16.880 --> 27:23.080]  all a bit of background to the the power the chief of the national grid here in
[27:23.080 --> 27:28.080]  the UK now what he's talking about though he hasn't admitted it publicly but I
[27:28.080 --> 27:32.520]  have made some investigations privately so I can tell your viewers and listeners
[27:32.520 --> 27:37.080]  and you can be the first to know this that during the cold snap indeed the
[27:37.080 --> 27:44.920]  cold is December since records began in 1659 in central England the power grid
[27:44.920 --> 27:51.160]  came in the UK throughout the whole of the UK within just three percent of its
[27:51.160 --> 27:55.400]  capacity and of course if you reach anything like that capacity you can
[27:55.400 --> 27:59.520]  trip the whole grid at a blackout not just part of the country but the whole
[27:59.520 --> 28:06.200]  country that very very nearly happened why did it happen because the
[28:06.200 --> 28:11.720]  government here which in all three of the major parties so-called doesn't
[28:11.720 --> 28:17.800]  believe in the coal-fired and gas-fired electricity which our economy was built
[28:17.800 --> 28:22.640]  on and by the way Lord Montyn that actually happened all over the US and
[28:22.640 --> 28:26.360]  the White House actually attacked prisonplanet.com in our article and
[28:26.360 --> 28:30.640]  said we were liars that they didn't have an anti-power plant agenda but in the
[28:30.640 --> 28:34.600]  next week their energy secretary came out and said we're gonna have massive
[28:34.600 --> 28:38.680]  coal plant closures on top of what they've already had and now the head of
[28:38.680 --> 28:43.200]  your energy program says get ready to not have power a lot of the time that's
[28:43.200 --> 28:47.320]  right I mean and the background to this is that we really we've only didn't get
[28:47.320 --> 28:51.640]  it and why it's because the windmills that are supposed to be generating five
[28:51.640 --> 28:55.960]  percent of our electricity weren't generating any their contribution to the
[28:55.960 --> 29:01.240]  grid in December was 0.0 percent because the wind basically didn't blow we were
[29:01.240 --> 29:04.520]  under a blocking high that's when you need the windmills the most and they're
[29:04.520 --> 29:09.120]  not there so closing down these coal plants and thinking you can replace them
[29:09.120 --> 29:14.200]  with useless windmills that cost 26 times as much to generate electricity this
[29:14.200 --> 29:19.880]  is not a forward-thinking radical or sensible green energy policy the only
[29:19.880 --> 29:24.160]  green energy policy that would work to keep the lights on and the wheels of
[29:24.160 --> 29:29.520]  industry turning and prosperity as well is to go nuclear if you don't want to
[29:29.520 --> 29:35.200]  keep the coal fired plant quite frankly Lord Monkton and we'll get your view
[29:35.200 --> 29:41.080]  on this on the other side I think that nukes overall are not as good as coal
[29:41.080 --> 29:45.920]  we got so much of it it's completely clean now and carbon dioxide is good for
[29:45.920 --> 29:52.200]  plants I say more cold plants good for the earth we're on the March the
[29:52.200 --> 29:59.280]  Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[30:01.040 --> 30:05.840]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[30:05.840 --> 30:11.360]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that
[30:11.360 --> 30:15.120]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've turned in members
[30:15.120 --> 30:20.160]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[30:20.160 --> 30:25.520]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[30:25.520 --> 30:30.440]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[30:30.440 --> 30:34.840]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[30:34.840 --> 30:38.560]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more
[30:38.560 --> 30:42.520]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[30:42.520 --> 30:48.160]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the
[30:48.160 --> 30:53.800]  Republic get your copy of full of the Republic on DVD at info wars dot com
[30:53.800 --> 31:00.400]  we're watching online right now in super high quality at prison planet TV this
[31:00.400 --> 31:03.920]  is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[31:03.920 --> 31:07.880]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[31:07.880 --> 31:12.160]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[31:12.160 --> 31:16.400]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[31:16.400 --> 31:20.760]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[31:20.760 --> 31:24.880]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[31:24.880 --> 31:29.440]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[31:29.440 --> 31:33.520]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[31:33.520 --> 31:37.520]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[31:37.520 --> 31:41.320]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[31:41.320 --> 31:44.040]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[31:44.040 --> 31:49.000]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at WWW dot my

[32:05.040 --> 32:09.760]  important day in America in more than 50 years he says it will change everything

[32:13.920 --> 32:17.280]  how you take care of your health and your own family now this man has made some
[32:17.280 --> 32:21.600]  outrageous predictions over the years the crazy part is he's usually right you
[32:21.600 --> 32:25.520]  see he predicted the collapse of GM Danny May Freddie Mac and America's
[32:25.520 --> 32:29.400]  biggest mall owner general growth properties in fact Barron's called his
[32:29.400 --> 32:33.880]  work a dire prophecy recently he created a video which you can watch online for
[32:33.880 --> 32:37.520]  free detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet and it's a real

[33:19.880 --> 33:25.560]  more Christopher Monk it is our guest he is the leading voice and expert with
[33:25.560 --> 33:32.120]  precision cutting up the lies and propaganda of the fake environmental
[33:32.120 --> 33:35.680]  lobby who could care less about the earth and real environmental problems
[33:35.680 --> 33:41.120]  that we do certainly have it's all about grabbing resources similar to Obama
[33:41.120 --> 33:47.160]  handing out 1,040 waivers to McDonald's and others where there are hundreds of
[33:47.160 --> 33:51.720]  thousands of employees don't have to get insurance but then their competition
[33:51.720 --> 33:57.680]  does so this is also about king making where you've got to get the license
[33:57.680 --> 34:05.040]  license here not evenly from government of the people but license to be able to
[34:05.040 --> 34:10.240]  operate and again here's the Daily Telegraph this is their words not mine
[34:10.240 --> 34:21.360]  this is written by the head of the energy program there in England and he
[34:21.360 --> 34:28.160]  says that the UK power chief says that the days of permanently available
[34:28.160 --> 34:31.600]  electricity may be coming to an end and it goes on the head of the power
[34:31.600 --> 34:36.080]  network said yesterday and then it has the quotes from him saying yes we're
[34:36.080 --> 34:39.840]  going to change our behavior consume less but yes it's not going to be cheap
[34:39.840 --> 34:43.240]  it's not going to be easily available and you will not have power all the time
[34:43.240 --> 34:48.120]  as a society that this is clear I mean there's no doubt but but then
[34:48.120 --> 34:54.120]  meanwhile the UN lobbies in England to shut down the oldest steel plant in in
[34:54.120 --> 35:02.440]  in England and then give the money to Pechari at the UN to move it to India I
[35:02.440 --> 35:06.600]  mean isn't this really just about the globalist have made their investments in
[35:06.600 --> 35:11.280]  China and if they can shut down Western Europe England the US their investments
[35:11.280 --> 35:16.040]  go up I mean it's not just hatred of America in England I mean that's the
[35:16.040 --> 35:20.000]  cherry on top but I mean isn't it more just about shutting down their
[35:20.000 --> 35:25.520]  competition Lord Moncton there's certainly a very big element of greed
[35:25.520 --> 35:31.560]  and self-interest on the part of the neo Marxists who are doing to us what they
[35:31.560 --> 35:35.920]  are doing to us and just to go back to to what the head of the grid said he said
[35:35.920 --> 35:40.040]  it's because windmills have been destabilizing the national grid nobody
[35:40.040 --> 35:43.960]  who operates a centralized grid likes to have windmills on it because they're
[35:43.960 --> 35:47.560]  so unpredictable you can't plan for when the wind's going to blow and when it's
[35:47.560 --> 35:51.320]  something going to stop and so it destabilizes the entire structure and
[35:51.320 --> 35:56.680]  puts all your power at risk but the more serious underlying problem is that
[35:56.680 --> 36:01.800]  because the governing class has gone stupid and has allowed itself to be
[36:01.800 --> 36:07.240]  fooled by a tiny clique of mad bad scientists into believing that adding a
[36:07.240 --> 36:11.640]  little carbon dioxide to the atmosphere is going to cause major changes to the
[36:11.640 --> 36:16.080]  climate when we've now had 60 years of evidence that it isn't going to have
[36:16.080 --> 36:20.920]  made major changes to the climate they're banning the the building of new
[36:20.920 --> 36:25.480]  co-fired plants you were mentioning Obama having done that having then told
[36:25.480 --> 36:30.120]  you you were a liar when you when you said he'd done it he said before the
[36:30.120 --> 36:36.040]  election had even taken place that he intended to shut down co-fired plants
[36:36.040 --> 36:39.560]  and to make coal prohibitively expensive and to tax people who use this
[36:39.560 --> 36:43.200]  punished them for using it and now he's trying to tell you you're a liar when he
[36:43.200 --> 36:47.640]  actually does what he said he does he was going to do it is it is a disgrace
[36:47.640 --> 36:51.640]  that they are attacking the coal industry in this way which is one of the
[36:51.640 --> 36:56.200]  bravest and most useful industries we have modern methods of burning coal are
[36:56.200 --> 37:00.280]  not dangerous they don't pollute they do put a little carbon dioxide into the
[37:00.280 --> 37:05.440]  atmosphere Lord Montyn please explain that please explain that because I've
[37:05.440 --> 37:09.520]  happened to study it myself in the modern plants nothing comes out the
[37:09.520 --> 37:14.440]  water vapor and carbon dioxide they run it through a whole bunch of different
[37:14.440 --> 37:20.160]  cleaning systems condensers it's all purified out but then the media gets up
[37:20.160 --> 37:23.680]  there and says these plants are incredibly toxic we've got to stop the
[37:23.680 --> 37:28.680]  carbon pollution because all that's left is carbon dioxide so they spin it and
[37:28.680 --> 37:34.200]  call carbon dioxide carbon scaring people I mean this is pure deception it
[37:34.200 --> 37:38.600]  is pure deception and it means they haven't kept abreast with the really
[37:38.600 --> 37:43.720]  quite dramatic changes in the technology for burning coal in in power
[37:43.720 --> 37:47.000]  station but let me describe if I may just one or two of the things that are
[37:47.000 --> 37:52.480]  now being done a colleague of mine called Steve Whitaker at Cambridge when I
[37:52.480 --> 37:57.120]  was there was already studying this and had come to the conclusion that you
[37:57.120 --> 38:03.400]  could improve the methods of combustion known as circulating fluidized bed
[38:03.400 --> 38:07.720]  construction come combustion by which you crush the coal into small particles
[38:07.720 --> 38:11.920]  and then you kind of have it on a cushion of air and burn it that way very
[38:11.920 --> 38:17.000]  very hot and very little dirt comes out of that process because the combustion
[38:17.000 --> 38:21.640]  is made much more complete and the more complete the combustion the fewer the
[38:21.640 --> 38:25.800]  particulate bits of pollution you get out of it it's turbocharged remain they
[38:25.800 --> 38:30.160]  now scrub out by using flue gas scrubbing by using various methods of
[38:30.160 --> 38:34.160]  washing so that so as you say all that you really get out of a cope on plant
[38:34.160 --> 38:37.640]  these days is water vapor which is harmless and CO2 which is not just
[38:37.640 --> 38:43.160]  harmless it's beneficial very well said now going back to the previous question
[38:43.160 --> 38:49.120]  what's your view on nuclear versus coal there's no doubt that we need both
[38:49.120 --> 38:54.360]  because we're going to get this continuing pressure on the coal industry
[38:54.360 --> 39:02.320]  it began under the KGB in the 1970s and early 80s it was they who engineered the
[39:02.320 --> 39:06.160]  two minor strikes of the UK one of which brought down Edward Heath government in
[39:06.160 --> 39:12.360]  1974 and another where they tried to do the same again in 1982 to 3 and they
[39:12.360 --> 39:18.160]  failed because we were ready for them but this was we were able to trace how
[39:18.160 --> 39:23.520]  the leader of the minors union had been trained in Moscow first for three weeks
[39:23.520 --> 39:29.200]  at the Patrice Lumumba Institute where they trained the various junior terrorists
[39:29.200 --> 39:33.040]  then they by the way the Russian government's pushing peak oil as well
[39:33.040 --> 39:36.600]  today well that's he will come on to that the moment let me just tell this story
[39:36.600 --> 39:40.120]  I'm sorry the minors union because they then sent him to the Lenin Institute
[39:40.120 --> 39:45.040]  where the really serious terrorists like Yasser Arafat which were trained and he
[39:45.040 --> 39:49.600]  was then sent back to Britain to try to destroy our energy-based economy by
[39:49.600 --> 39:55.920]  shutting down the coal industry and he didn't succeed we beat him and now
[39:55.920 --> 40:01.320]  Obama is doing the same thing but this time from the president's office no
[40:01.320 --> 40:05.480]  longer directed by the KGB because he believed the same sort of things as the
[40:05.480 --> 40:09.440]  KGB believed in those days and he seems to me to be perfectly willing to shut
[40:09.440 --> 40:14.480]  America down for reasons which are very difficult to fathom because this is
[40:14.480 --> 40:18.920]  whether he likes it or not his country now even if he was born in Kenya as some
[40:18.920 --> 40:23.840]  say the fact is he's now an American citizen and an American system he has a
[40:23.840 --> 40:28.040]  duty of loyalty to his country and you don't go around shutting down the
[40:28.040 --> 40:32.560]  country's primary source of energy if you really believe in the future of your
[40:32.560 --> 40:37.320]  country it's it's the wrong way for a president to behave and he should stop
[40:37.320 --> 40:42.160]  doing that he should also look in my view much more carefully at the science
[40:42.160 --> 40:46.240]  behind this climate nonsense which is now frankly collapsing with every new
[40:46.240 --> 40:50.840]  scientific paper that comes out it's now blindingly clear in a very important
[40:50.840 --> 40:55.760]  paper published just a few months ago by Dr. Roy Spencer whom I'm sure you know
[40:55.760 --> 40:59.960]  well of the University of Alabama at Huntsville who does all the satellite
[40:59.960 --> 41:04.640]  monitoring and he has discovered that the effect of the extra water vapor in
[41:04.640 --> 41:09.080]  the atmosphere as it gets warmer is to increase the thickness of low clouds
[41:09.080 --> 41:13.680]  which reflect more of the sunlight back into space and that actually causes a
[41:13.680 --> 41:18.000]  cooling of the planet which largely offsets any warming you might get from
[41:18.000 --> 41:23.480]  CO2 and greatly changes all the numbers so that we're not going to see very much
[41:23.480 --> 41:27.680]  warming over the next hundred years at all maybe he thinks for half a degree
[41:27.680 --> 41:32.160]  Celsius maybe one degree Celsius that's two degrees Fahrenheit absolute max this
[41:32.160 --> 41:36.760]  is not on any view any kind of a problem so we need to go right back to the
[41:36.760 --> 41:41.600]  science and remember there is no need to do any of this but then you talk of the
[41:41.600 --> 41:45.200]  alternative energies that they're trying to these these windmills they're
[41:45.200 --> 41:49.000]  putting up everywhere for instance which kill birds in large numbers but they
[41:49.000 --> 41:52.680]  don't produce very much electricity and electricity they do produce is produced
[41:52.680 --> 41:58.760]  at monumental cost the largest such wind farm in the world is the Thanet wind
[41:58.760 --> 42:04.840]  array that's just off the coast of Kent in England and that is subsidized to the
[42:04.840 --> 42:10.480]  tune of two billion dollars for one wind farm over the next 20 years guaranteed
[42:10.480 --> 42:14.480]  by the British taxpayer whether he likes it or not through the government and if
[42:14.480 --> 42:21.120]  every measure to make global warming go away whereas cost ineffective as the
[42:21.120 --> 42:28.480]  Thanet wind array then to forestall the 3.4 Celsius or 6.8 by around 6 Fahrenheit
[42:28.480 --> 42:33.240]  degrees of warming that the UN expects to happen in the next hundred years would
[42:33.240 --> 42:39.040]  cost 20% of world gross domestic product of all the goods and services we
[42:39.040 --> 42:43.920]  produce all the way around the world 20% would have to be devoted just to making
[42:43.920 --> 42:48.400]  global warming go away Lord Moncton is this just not economic warfare by the
[42:48.400 --> 42:52.320]  insiders seizing the energy infrastructure you said something that is
[42:52.320 --> 42:58.160]  central to everything England the United States Canada the other the the the
[42:58.160 --> 43:04.120]  wealthy nations of the planet are energy-based and idea-based economies
[43:04.120 --> 43:11.000]  our countries are set up to be energy rich and so you cut the energy off to
[43:11.000 --> 43:15.160]  some third-world country sure people are going to die but if you cut start cutting
[43:15.160 --> 43:19.440]  the energy off to a first world nation we are going to completely implode we
[43:19.440 --> 43:26.120]  live in in far spread out areas we are designed around the combustion engine we
[43:26.120 --> 43:31.560]  are designed around coal-powered plants that supply over 50% of our power here
[43:31.560 --> 43:36.400]  in the US we can't compete if we don't have it and China is building three to
[43:36.400 --> 43:41.040]  five a week we don't even get two or three a year they have covertly been
[43:41.040 --> 43:44.960]  shutting down or shot stopping hundreds I just put on screen the news articles
[43:44.960 --> 43:48.960]  where they say they're going to shut down thousands I mean this is economic
[43:48.960 --> 43:56.080]  savage warfare and is high treason and we must must resist them what are your
[43:56.080 --> 44:02.520]  ideas to stop them because here's my second point as a caveat to that here's
[44:02.520 --> 44:08.080]  the French news agency world six mass extinction maybe underway studies says
[44:08.080 --> 44:13.160]  due to climate change they say man is about to be extinct it so is this a
[44:13.160 --> 44:17.720]  self-fulfilling a prophecy where all these global warren people say humans
[44:17.720 --> 44:22.600]  are bad we'd be better off without them we need eco-fascism but get ready for
[44:22.600 --> 44:27.200]  humans to die everywhere so that as they cut the power supplies off especially
[44:27.200 --> 44:31.480]  the third world and a billion plus die they then claim that's part of the mass
[44:31.480 --> 44:36.080]  extinction caused by the imaginary global warming when they themselves the
[44:36.080 --> 44:41.200]  neo eugenicists have triggered it I think we've got to look very carefully at
[44:41.200 --> 44:47.680]  the motives of some of these people remember that we had for many decades
[44:47.680 --> 44:52.240]  throughout the first really the first three quarters of the 20th century we had
[44:52.240 --> 44:58.720]  an active communist Marxist system that was trying to destroy the economies of
[44:58.720 --> 45:03.520]  the West and had learned that the way to destroy them was via energy now when
[45:03.520 --> 45:08.520]  the Berlin Wall came down these people did not disappear they did not give up
[45:08.520 --> 45:13.360]  they merely moved into the green movement and you may think if you're
[45:13.360 --> 45:18.120]  listening to this program who is this lunatic potty pier saying these strange
[45:18.120 --> 45:25.080]  extreme things on the line from England well get this I spoke to the late Eric
[45:25.080 --> 45:28.480]  Ellington it was a very good friend of mine he was one of the founders of green
[45:28.480 --> 45:34.120]  peace now here was a guy who genuinely believed that we should leave the planet
[45:34.120 --> 45:38.920]  a better place that we found it that we should not pollute it not destroy it not
[45:38.920 --> 45:43.560]  rape its resources to a degree that was excessive he was a sensible genuine
[45:43.560 --> 45:49.440]  kind-hearted really genuinely green environmentalist and he made his living
[45:49.440 --> 45:53.600]  as a landscape photographer going around and photographing the beauties of
[45:53.600 --> 45:58.360]  nature on behalf of those who wish to be it to be recorded for all time he was a
[45:58.360 --> 46:03.960]  genuinely good man and he it was who told me that he and several of his co
[46:03.960 --> 46:09.280]  founders of Greenpeace had to leave that movement after a few years because the
[46:09.280 --> 46:14.880]  Marxists had moved in and taken it over and they no longer used the rhetoric of
[46:14.880 --> 46:20.920]  Marxism to destroy the world's energy-based economy by going for that
[46:20.920 --> 46:25.640]  soft underbelly which is energy generation they began talking the language
[46:25.640 --> 46:30.600]  of environmentalism in said it's exactly the same people with exactly the
[46:30.600 --> 46:36.400]  same motives it's a kind of hatred of the success and the prosperity and the
[46:36.400 --> 46:43.800]  democracy of the West they do not like the idea that we the people by our
[46:43.800 --> 46:49.560]  cross on the ballot paper can decide better than they can how we should be
[46:49.560 --> 46:55.360]  governed they hate the very notion that the people know best what is best for
[46:55.360 --> 46:59.760]  the people and so what they're doing is that that particular faction for there
[46:59.760 --> 47:04.560]  are many factions in this game that particular faction which is not small it
[47:04.560 --> 47:10.360]  is not ill funded it is powerful it has lots of money that faction is trying to
[47:10.360 --> 47:16.800]  drive this scare with the deliberate and increasingly openly stated intention of
[47:16.800 --> 47:22.160]  shutting down the West now we can do two things we can sit there as we sat and
[47:22.160 --> 47:27.640]  watch mesmerized while Hitler proposed to shut down the West by his armies
[47:27.640 --> 47:33.240]  marching in and we can sit with similarly mesmerized fashion fascination as a
[47:33.240 --> 47:37.920]  different kind of rhetoric but just as Ruth says we should not only shut down
[47:37.920 --> 47:42.200]  the rest of the West but perhaps the more extreme one say and you know and
[47:42.200 --> 47:45.880]  you've quoted them before and say it that humanity should be wiped from the
[47:45.880 --> 47:50.000]  face of the earth and they're perfectly happy to get to help it along the way
[47:50.000 --> 47:55.480]  by destroying our energy now imagine the consequences of the policy they are
[47:55.480 --> 48:02.520]  advocating imagine an elderly lady who has contributed to society all her life
[48:02.520 --> 48:08.240]  who lives on an upper floor of an apartment block seems she might be 20
[48:08.240 --> 48:12.960]  or 30 floors above the ground how is she going to get there if there is no
[48:12.960 --> 48:19.720]  electricity to turn the wheels of the elevator basic questions like that because
[48:19.720 --> 48:24.240]  our infrastructure an operation how is anyone going to take an x-ray when the
[48:24.240 --> 48:29.000]  electricity is working none of this is thought through none of it is joined up
[48:29.000 --> 48:34.200]  all of it is flagrantly irresponsible very dangerous and I'm going to go so
[48:34.200 --> 48:37.880]  far as to say and I don't think this is unreasonable say this it is treasonous
[48:37.880 --> 48:42.040]  and eventually the people who are doing this are going to have to be rounded up
[48:42.040 --> 48:47.840]  and put on trial for trying to destroy the very society that bred them and which
[48:47.840 --> 48:53.240]  now lionizes them for the policies which if implemented would end up destroying
[48:53.240 --> 48:58.880]  it and them too well yes sir in fact you just stole my thunder look in the last
[48:58.880 --> 49:06.040]  two years thousands of prominent people hundreds of scientists you in heads come
[49:06.040 --> 49:10.360]  out and say we want environmental fascism we want a dictatorial world
[49:10.360 --> 49:14.880]  government the Financial Times of London foreign editor we're gonna do this for
[49:14.880 --> 49:19.000]  your own good we're going to have a global one-child policy Ted Turner just
[49:19.000 --> 49:23.680]  said that in Mexico a few months ago you were there I mean these people are brazen
[49:23.680 --> 49:28.800]  authoritarians saying they're coming for our private property saying they're
[49:28.800 --> 49:32.880]  coming for our children saying they're coming for our infrastructure and now
[49:32.880 --> 49:38.960]  they're doing it they have declared unmitigated war against us and and we're
[49:38.960 --> 49:43.520]  at a handicapped because you're apologizing for telling the truth I'm
[49:43.520 --> 49:49.360]  apologizing when words can't describe how maniacal I mean it's like the TV ads
[49:49.360 --> 49:53.320]  they ran in England showing small children not going along with carbon
[49:53.320 --> 49:58.960]  taxes so their teacher murders them and and and I mean this is a group of
[49:58.960 --> 50:05.240]  miscreant self-hating gibbering control freaks that are enemies and I can't
[50:05.240 --> 50:10.080]  imagine a jury anywhere that will not convict them for calling for mass murder
[50:10.080 --> 50:14.640]  throw them in prison now they're declaring war on us now actually you
[50:14.640 --> 50:20.320]  raise an interesting point there because although the right of free speech in the
[50:20.320 --> 50:27.320]  United States is very wide it does not reach as far as addition and sedition
[50:27.320 --> 50:30.800]  is what they're now preaching when they start preaching that children who
[50:30.800 --> 50:35.520]  disagree with the so-called mainstream opinion on climate change should be
[50:35.520 --> 50:39.960]  blown to bits and you see a picture of the teacher hitting a red button and then
[50:39.960 --> 50:43.880]  you see the splattered blood of the children falling on the other children
[50:43.880 --> 50:48.640]  and this is the kind of propaganda that the green movement now regards as
[50:48.640 --> 50:54.320]  appropriate then this is a wake-up call to the civilized world that the own
[50:54.320 --> 50:58.680]  civilized the usual suspect the annual of the eco fascist not afraid that's a
[50:58.680 --> 51:04.920]  sensible name for them that these people are intent on destruction there are two
[51:04.920 --> 51:08.560]  kinds of people in politics those who wish to build and those who wish to
[51:08.560 --> 51:15.040]  destroy and on the hard environmental left in the traffic light tendency the
[51:15.040 --> 51:21.280]  greens to yellow to admit they're really red these people have absolutely no
[51:21.280 --> 51:25.280]  intention of playing by the Queensbury rules they have no intention of
[51:25.280 --> 51:30.720]  following democracy no intention of living by the ballot box that is why
[51:30.720 --> 51:38.760]  here and in many other areas of life they are working away to transfer governing
[51:38.760 --> 51:45.600]  power from elected hand in the individual nation-state to unelected hand
[51:45.600 --> 51:51.880]  in supranational organizations whose common defining characteristic is the
[51:51.880 --> 51:57.480]  total absence of any form of democratic control over them or election of their
[51:57.480 --> 52:03.960]  people and just to be clear Lord Moncton on record we've never called for
[52:03.960 --> 52:08.520]  their investigation and arrest until they began like a group of black birds in a
[52:08.520 --> 52:14.280]  tree you know seeing to the same tune to have us arrested to have us killed to
[52:14.280 --> 52:21.000]  have one-child policies to to put in prison or execute climate change
[52:21.000 --> 52:28.400]  deniers they are openly calling for an authoritarian nightmare planet run by
[52:28.400 --> 52:34.080]  them they have made the declarations of tyranny and if I announced that I wanted
[52:34.080 --> 52:37.480]  to rob and kill my neighbor and then I was going to do it the police would come
[52:37.480 --> 52:42.280]  arrest me why are they allowed to get away with this I think I'm answering my
[52:42.280 --> 52:45.560]  own question why do they come out with such outrageous statements are they
[52:45.560 --> 52:50.600]  trying to condition us to the extreme ideas so that they can then have the
[52:50.600 --> 52:54.880]  moral high ground in their minds to start actually carrying this out what
[52:54.880 --> 52:59.160]  they're doing is it's a well-known political technique they're pushing the
[52:59.160 --> 53:04.680]  envelope they're seeing how far they can push before we push back and if we
[53:04.680 --> 53:09.960]  don't push back they go on pushing forward now the question is how to push
[53:09.960 --> 53:14.760]  back and I think there are various ways but those who are listening to this
[53:14.760 --> 53:20.760]  program who may think that it all sounds terribly extreme can in fact reassure
[53:20.760 --> 53:25.280]  themselves that what we're saying is not in fact extreme at all it is the
[53:25.280 --> 53:28.960]  solid truth there are plenty of evidence of science and public policy
[53:28.960 --> 53:34.360]  dot org of what these people are up to how they tried to bend the science of
[53:34.360 --> 53:39.000]  climate in the climate case emails which revealed a great deal of the methods
[53:39.000 --> 53:43.040]  they were using how they are trying to distort the economic case how they're
[53:43.040 --> 53:49.480]  trying to capture politics and how they are trying very furtively to transfer
[53:49.480 --> 53:55.720]  power via things like the Cancun agreement to hundreds hundreds of
[53:55.720 --> 54:01.160]  interlocking new UN sponsored bureaucracies that will be answerable to
[54:01.160 --> 54:06.000]  the secretariat of the state parties to the UN and by the way that UN program
[54:06.000 --> 54:11.080]  talks about relocation of populations because of their carbon footprint you
[54:11.080 --> 54:17.560]  also see Obama ignoring the Congress and using the unelected bureaucracy to
[54:17.560 --> 54:22.640]  shut down power plants in closing Lord Moncton as you know it's come out in the
[54:22.640 --> 54:27.880]  last few days that the NPR officers compared deniers of climate change to
[54:27.880 --> 54:33.640]  birthers and flat earth believers the undercover video was running during the
[54:33.640 --> 54:37.920]  meeting and they're getting taxpayer money and these are virulent
[54:37.920 --> 54:44.160]  anti-human wicked control freaks well I think it's time we started taking them
[54:44.160 --> 54:50.400]  to court for the criminal offense of sedition because that's what it is they
[54:50.400 --> 54:56.520]  pushed too far and where you can go to these meetings where they speak where
[54:56.520 --> 55:04.000]  you can record those videos just send them in to prisonplanet.com there the
[55:04.000 --> 55:08.880]  team will look at them and they will then pass on to me the more interesting
[55:08.880 --> 55:12.880]  one where these people speak out and say things they shouldn't and openly preach
[55:12.880 --> 55:17.920]  sedition I am in touch with various legal foundations in the states who can
[55:17.920 --> 55:22.840]  help to bring these people to trial for the criminal offense of sedition
[55:22.840 --> 55:28.160]  against the people of the United States and all it takes is one or two of these
[55:28.160 --> 55:33.720]  to be brought up in front of a jury who hears what they've been saying looks at
[55:33.720 --> 55:38.240]  the videos they'd be producing of children being blown up and then finds
[55:38.240 --> 55:42.560]  them guilty of sedition and sends them away to prison for a few years to think
[55:42.560 --> 55:47.600]  about their folly and all the rest of these cowards will run for cover and
[55:47.600 --> 55:53.600]  the scare will be over so you can help by filming these people as they make
[55:53.600 --> 55:58.280]  these extreme remarks film carefully so they don't see you filming or they'll
[55:58.280 --> 56:03.520]  destroy your film get it out get it to prisonplanet.com they will
[56:03.520 --> 56:08.000]  pass it to me I will pass it to the lawyers and we will start prosecuting
[56:08.000 --> 56:13.960]  these people until America is free once again absolutely because I mean they
[56:13.960 --> 56:17.640]  are calling for ending the democratic process they are calling for our arrest
[56:17.640 --> 56:21.520]  we're not the ones drawing first blood we're saying when you say overthrow a
[56:21.520 --> 56:27.040]  system of government arrest people you don't agree with one child policies you
[56:27.040 --> 56:30.040]  know when you take a country over you blow up their power plants first when
[56:30.040 --> 56:35.600]  you invade they're destroying our power system this is warfare and these are the
[56:35.600 --> 56:41.440]  most sickening self-hating loathing control freaks you can imagine they
[56:41.440 --> 56:45.280]  must be met they must be defeated they want their organized planned economy
[56:45.280 --> 56:48.520]  and they've got to destroy our infrastructure to do it science and
[56:48.520 --> 56:53.040]  public policy.org Lord Christopher Monkton thank you for joining us I
[56:53.040 --> 56:57.080]  look forward to having you up in the near future you've got one minute left

[57:02.560 --> 57:07.160]  people when they make these speeches if you see cuttings of them reported in
[57:07.160 --> 57:11.360]  the newspapers send them in to blackprisonplanet.com we're going to
[57:11.360 --> 57:17.520]  start a file on these people once there is enough material we will then move to
[57:17.520 --> 57:21.760]  prosecute them because the correct way to deal with them is not violent it's not
[57:21.760 --> 57:27.600]  killing it is prosecution in the courts of law that's how your Constitution said
[57:27.600 --> 57:31.560]  it should be done and it's that Constitution and the freedom and
[57:31.560 --> 57:36.960]  democracy that it guarantees that we are all sworn to defend that's what we're
[57:36.960 --> 57:40.880]  going to try to do to keep democracy alive despite what these people are
[57:40.880 --> 57:45.520]  trying to do so God bless you all God bless you Alex and God bless America
[57:45.520 --> 57:49.240]  absolutely they are a vowed authoritarians they must be met head on

[58:11.560 --> 58:15.000]  when they start calling for us to be arrested and they've got government
[58:15.000 --> 58:18.080]  power and then they're talking about how they want to kill 80% of the world

[59:04.040 --> 59:08.840]  fuel prices hit a 30-month high in February and pump prices are expected to
[59:08.840 --> 59:13.480]  reach $5 a gallon because of shipping costs food is being priced out of the
[59:13.480 --> 59:18.280]  reach of millions of Americans with an expected 35% jump in the next 60 days

[01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:41.560]  out there is a natural national resource owned by the government that's who
[01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:45.360]  will distribute it to themselves so the fools in the streets will only get small
[01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:49.720]  paltry chicken feet amounts of it but it's more sophisticated than that the
[01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:53.920]  big banksters that michael more pointed out that have been robbing us are
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:59.880]  robbing us and he says well there's 400 people that have as much wealth as half
[01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:05.040]  the rest the other country 400 people have as much wealth as 50 percent of the
[01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:15.280]  people but he's not telling you that the other you'll group in there that that
[01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:22.040]  from that 50% up to that one half of 1% has more wealth than those other groups
[01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:26.600]  together it's that big fat middle class there that's really being targeted by
[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:30.280]  the banksters the banksters destroy the economy by design they bring in the
[01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:35.640]  crisis they offer the solution with the government employees and people on
[01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:43.360]  government contracts and then they come in and rob what's left the middle class
[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:46.960]  and transfer most of it offshore but give chicken feet of their own minions
[01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:49.840]  that's what Michael Moore isn't explaining and I'm gonna go over it all
[01:01:49.840 --> 01:02:02.560]  in detail in the next hour after Dr. Nick baggage leaves us in other news here
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:07.840]  today well I tell you we're gonna have to get Lindsey Williams back on this

[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:25.280]  entertaining but seriously it's the information he has a little bit of
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:32.240]  gallus humor there Saudi Arabia's Day of Rage lures record bets on $200 oil
[01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:39.360]  chart of the day and Bloomberg is reporting that
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:50.640]  June delivery is now looking like it could be $200 a barrel so we're gonna

[01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:24.640]  through your eyes programming the brain that way but options traders are
[01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:28.720]  betting more than ever that crude oil is heading to $200 a barrel as some
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:32.000]  websites call for the day of rage in Saudi Arabia and anti-government protests

[01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:45.920]  what they've engineered in our society and solutions to counter it all those
[01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:49.840]  poor union people up there protesting they have no idea what's happening this
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:53.720]  is austerity this is where everything is cut to pay it to the bankers the
[01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:57.960]  republicans up there they have no idea what's happening we're gonna explain
[01:10:57.960 --> 01:11:01.920]  that coming up in the third hour today how they need to shift their paradigm
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:06.160]  and see the big picture so that is coming up but again the secrets of Oz

[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:47.960]  8 7 6 0 that is correct okay let me just kind of reset here for a moment
[01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:51.560]  because when I get into a subject this big and this important I really want to
[01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:56.200]  be on I really want to be focused and I want people to understand this is not
[01:11:56.200 --> 01:12:04.680]  hyperbole okay just like 15 years ago I was sent secret documents from a nurse
[01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:09.720]  in San Antonio about all babies at birth having their blood taken and put in a
[01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:16.800]  secret global database for bio weapons development drug development you name it
[01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:22.400]  race specific bio weapon development and I covered these secret documents on
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:27.360]  air and then families began to sue in the last decade and one suits in Minnesota
[01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:32.120]  Texas and other areas every time I did research it was my listeners suing because
[01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:35.600]  they go to the hospital they watch them take the blood they tell them no they
[01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:40.200]  still do it and they caught them now it's admitted secret global database
[01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:44.800]  upkept by the Pentagon in the US race specific bio weapon research you name
[01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:49.320]  it people couldn't believe me for 15 years even though I had the documents
[01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:53.400]  it's kind of like 1996 the telecommunications act said all cell
[01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:56.760]  phones will be tracked in real time the government can dial in and listen
[01:12:56.760 --> 01:13:02.440]  to you without your phone even being on this was under federal law for the
[01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:06.760]  regulations now it's mainstream news people go oh yeah everybody knows that
[01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:12.560]  they don't want you knowing about this until it's already in place now dr. Nick
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:19.320]  maggich was on with us a few months ago and he said Alex he said you're
[01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:25.040]  focusing so much on sodium fluoride which lowers IQ and causes degeneration
[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:29.680]  of the bones and causes lowering IQ sure that's important you're focusing on
[01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:34.880]  mercury lead things like that he said the real issue is and what what I see most
[01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:42.680]  of the globalist interest is in is psychotronic electronic wavelengths light
[01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:47.720]  and since I had him on and I've done a lot of research on it as well and we're
[01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:51.920]  gonna go to the doctor here in a moment I've seen all these mainstream news
[01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:58.240]  articles about US patents 65061 48 nervous system manipulation by
[01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:03.680]  electromagnetic fields for monitors we know there's the propaganda on TV we
[01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:06.440]  know that there's the flicker rate that puts you in a dream state
[01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:10.760]  highly suggestible but this is more than that and literally hundreds and
[01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:15.920]  hundreds and hundreds of patents dealing with this in DARPA in the mainstream
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:20.120]  news in the Baltimore Suns thing over testing towers to calm you during
[01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:25.240]  emergencies so there's this coming out of this ceiling lights in Minnesota sin
[01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:29.840]  coded internet data flicker rate well your eyes are just like an infrared
[01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:34.840]  collector but they pick up part of that spectrum it can program the brain the
[01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:39.640]  the data down power lines which they now admit will control your thermostat your
[01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:43.480]  refrigerator they're invading through everything they're way ahead of us
[01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:48.280]  technologically this is why they're so arrogant and reading these patents it
[01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:54.200]  says they can physiologically change you including hurting you potentially
[01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:59.520]  triggering heart attacks you name it through the television so the point is
[01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:04.280]  we're gonna look at the systems that can be used to attack us with dr. Nick
[01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:08.960]  baggage of earth pulse calm the eldest son of the late United States Congress
[01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:14.160]  from Alaska Nick baggage senior if I go over dr. baggage his whole bio will be
[01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:19.720]  here for hours his brother is a US senator obviously senator baggage but
[01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:23.520]  he's a really a leading expert he's been an expert speaker before the EU
[01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:30.440]  Parliament the list goes on and on let me just shift gears down to dr. baggage I
[01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:35.320]  did that long intro so folks could know where we're going with this but and I
[01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:37.960]  understand you don't want to scare people you want to empower them with this
[01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:42.680]  info but if people aren't even aware of it I don't even see it as scaring if I
[01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:46.280]  can tell somebody hey don't don't jump off that cliff you might get hurt that's
[01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:50.120]  not fear I'm telling them what's happening I want folks to become aware of
[01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:54.200]  this and your deep research into the patents and things that we know are
[01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:58.320]  clearly being covertly rolled out and tested dr. baggage thank you for joining
[01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:01.320]  us hey thanks for having me Alex it's always great to be with you you know
[01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:06.480]  that patent that you just cited and it came out of a recent press report
[01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:11.640]  actually I quoted the exact same patent back in 2006 in the book controlling the
[01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:17.000]  human mind and it's our footnote number 86 and it's actually clustered around a
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:22.360]  whole series of patents that deal with you know deal with this same same
[01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:26.720]  situation let me just read some of the just the names of the past which make
[01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:31.320]  sense for folks and will actually draw out some of the information one of them
[01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:37.240]  is a human auditory system responses to modulated electromagnetic fields we
[01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:41.480]  have another one that's listed that's an apparatus and method for remotely
[01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:46.800]  monitoring and altering brain waves another one multi-channel brain signal
[01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:50.480]  amplifying and digitizing system so that you could actually you know pick a
[01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:55.840]  signal out and and transfer it through a computer system but there's a series of
[01:16:55.840 --> 01:17:00.720]  there's dozens of them quoted in that book and footnoted there and the and
[01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:06.120]  the reason we wrote this was this week considered to be the most significant
[01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:11.160]  issue facing the 21st century I mean when you think about whether it's light
[01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:16.080]  emitted from a television set by modulating or pulsing that light in a
[01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:21.200]  very specific way you can create all kinds of physical physiological coupling
[01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:26.600]  not just with a nervous system but then affecting the entire system whether
[01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:31.600]  you're targeting the brain or just creating a situation of hyper relaxation
[01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:37.200]  so that when the normal propaganda through advertising or news reports or
[01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:41.720]  what have you it actually integrates at a much much deeper level than most
[01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:45.360]  people realize and they think about your wife hollering at you know what you're
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:49.440]  watching a television show and you're totally oblivious are you talking to
[01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:53.760]  your kids and they absolutely do not register it in their consciousness
[01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:57.240]  anything you're saying they're actually in a very light
[01:17:57.240 --> 01:18:02.480]  trance like state and they are literally not watching the program they are the
[01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:06.720]  program and that and that's the important direction in which technology
[01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:11.880]  change there's another article that we quote from the US Army War College and
[01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:15.600]  it's in their quarterly called perimeters the article was called the
[01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:21.520]  mind has no firewalls that was written back in the late 90s but we we quote
[01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:26.800]  that frequently because what it says is that any electromagnetic carrier
[01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:31.640]  whether it's the radio or TV networks or even the electromagnetic grid that
[01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:36.640]  surrounds all of us or cell phone towers or any of these things can carry a
[01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:40.840]  signal can modulate a sort of a secondary signal that the body will
[01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:45.000]  recognize or the mind will recognize depending on how that's tuned and
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:50.720]  literally think of the human body as well as a very very finely engineered
[01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:55.680]  electromagnetic circuit that can be manipulated in the same way as other
[01:18:55.680 --> 01:18:59.920]  less sophisticated man-made electromagnetic circuit and the
[01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:05.120]  difference is our level of knowledge and technology is allowing us to couple
[01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:09.960]  with the human body in a much much different way and a much higher
[01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:15.360]  resolution where much more is possible and that's why this is such a critical
[01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:20.920]  issue not from the standpoint of fear but if we don't have knowledge when we
[01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:24.280]  start to see the effects of this and I think we already are in many many ways
[01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:29.040]  it won't be understandable it won't make sense but but in the context of
[01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:33.920]  technology it all makes well look 20 years ago I'd go out of the countryside
[01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:38.080]  wouldn't feel relieved when I get away from cell phones and get out the middle
[01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:42.440]  of nowhere I feel like a human being again and there's no doubt I have the
[01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:46.600]  documents they're testing all of this on us and now under the cyber security
[01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:50.800]  homeland security takeover of all telecommunications they're putting
[01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:55.840]  their equipment in to push carrier waves over the top of it and that's why
[01:19:55.840 --> 01:19:59.600]  they're so arrogant the general public isn't a mind-control trance right now
[01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:02.800]  we're trying to break you out you just laugh every time the news plays another
[01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:06.200]  story about a foreclosure bank or attorney under investigation bankrupted
[01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:10.440]  or being sued zero debt has a program that stops foreclosure guaranteed for

[01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:24.520]  your name by using the banks very own foreclosure process loan modification is
[01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:28.040]  a joke the banks use that to take your money with nothing in return and keeping
[01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:31.320]  you in default you've heard our ad before we are not investors bankers
[01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:34.640]  attorneys or real estate agents we are a group of people just like you that are

[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:07.680]  fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last chance to not
[01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:12.000]  relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that will be pulling the
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:16.480]  rug from underneath the Americans at home turning men's influence on our
[01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:20.720]  president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's
[01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:25.960]  incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for the
[01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:30.520]  Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:34.880]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:38.600]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more
[01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:42.560]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the check out to today seems
[01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:48.120]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of

[01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:03.480]  making the right decisions is a challenge to investors are we going to
[01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:07.200]  see economic growth slide into a recession or at worst depression hi
[01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:11.520]  Ted Anderson from Midas Resources we all know when a company acts irresponsibly
[01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:15.120]  divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent when the market
[01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:19.320]  becomes volatile US Treasuries are a safe haven but what do you do when the US

[01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:42.200]  system over all radio and TV the president's announced he's gonna start
[01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:46.880]  making announcements on those announcements on 9,000 telescreens at
[01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:50.520]  the Walmart's other locations where you've got to look at the message when
[01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:54.280]  you're in the checkout line you've got to look at the jumbo tron and and the
[01:24:54.280 --> 01:25:00.240]  study show that now within seconds you can become mesmerized by TV with these
[01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:06.760]  messages the whole world is being turned basically into a Times Square system
[01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:11.160]  the license plates are going to switch to digital California's announcing with
[01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:16.480]  messages there little TV screens you can see this control grid they're putting
[01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:21.720]  in and reading these patents they cannot just make you suggestible or
[01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:26.480]  submissive they can make you angry they can make you they can modulate it and
[01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:30.840]  they can go in and trigger brain waves it looks like this says and actually kill
[01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:34.440]  you better than a hammer if they want to doctor right you they can actually
[01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:40.400]  modify signals to target any system of the body not just the brain they can
[01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:46.520]  they can target any of the vital organs using modulated signals they can attack
[01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:52.240]  specific cells you know in particular trigger certain effects elementally
[01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:56.200]  within the body that can cause overloading cause the body to
[01:25:56.200 --> 01:26:01.200]  malfunction and essentially shut down cell phones they admit increased brain
[01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:07.080]  activity now right right you know this is again any physiological effect FDA is
[01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:11.800]  supposed to be controlling that and here finally after what a decade or more I
[01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:16.320]  think we published our first article on cell phones and Explorer magazine back
[01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:22.800]  in 1998 and never changed our opinion and quite frankly time has proven when
[01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:27.840]  you look at our work over the last 15 years everything we suggested has come
[01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:31.800]  to pass in terms of how the technology evolves and how it would be used against
[01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:36.800]  us this area in particular in fact the military Air Force research lab called
[01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:40.200]  refers to this whole area is controlled effects the idea of being able to
[01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:45.440]  overload all of the sensory systems so that you can create complete sort of
[01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:49.440]  holographic experiences that's the target of that article and it was the
[01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:54.680]  front-page story and technology horizons back in June of 2004 and there was an
[01:26:54.680 --> 01:26:58.280]  it was by the electromagnetic directorate of the Air Force most folks
[01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:02.160]  don't even know there is such an organization and and as you've noticed
[01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:05.800]  because you you say look chemicals are important but Alex most the funding is
[01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:10.160]  the electromagnetic this we don't know all the secrets we know enough but we
[01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:13.600]  know they're spending the big money on this right well actually there's quite
[01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:19.760]  a bit you know we had I posted on our website a number of DARPA overheads
[01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:23.760]  that they used in some various presentations on creating interactions
[01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:27.280]  and coupling with the human nervous system the very stuff of the article
[01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:31.360]  that you just quoted in the patent you quoted earlier and this stuff put out by
[01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:36.720]  DARPA I think goes back to 2002-2003 vintage yeah I remember them in the
[01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:41.280]  Baltimore Sun saying we're testing towers in Baltimore it's no big deal to
[01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:45.720]  calm you in emergencies right now remember it was just a few weeks ago
[01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:50.040]  there was another article that was even I think more important in this sense is
[01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:56.640]  it talked about our scyops operatives in Afghanistan targeting US congressional
[01:27:56.640 --> 01:28:00.800]  people that were out there touring the battlefield to get them to be more
[01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:06.840]  convinced yes larger troops were allocations were needed so on well they
[01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:11.120]  didn't describe exactly what they use but this technology literally getting it
[01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:16.440]  in their head is exactly what you would use in fact when we presented a version
[01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:22.200]  of this technology the European Parliament back in 1998 you know they
[01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:26.120]  recognized who would be the first target our leadership because if you can
[01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:30.800]  preempt or co-op leadership in some way the rest of the population generally
[01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:34.600]  just yeah that's the key here governments are obsessed with this because they
[01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:38.080]  know how important it is right and it's not just our government I mean the
[01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:43.160]  Chinese spent just as much money when you consider purchasing power maybe more
[01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:46.640]  than we have because you know people forget that they all everyone laughs
[01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:51.120]  about all the Chinese don't spend any money on this stuff 60 60 billion a
[01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:56.200]  year 70 billion a year in military what's that well go see what you buy for
[01:28:56.200 --> 01:29:00.400]  that kind of money in China for two bucks an hour in a bowl the right they
[01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:03.680]  don't have as much fraud either because they have a ruling class that already
[01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:08.480]  runs it all well that's true and this the you know the solution you know for
[01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:12.960]  them is about 15 cents I think and in the equivalent you know it is the bullet
[01:29:12.960 --> 01:29:17.520]  behind the back of the head but the point of the matter is these technologies
[01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:23.240]  are not that complicated so much so that other sophisticated societies can't
[01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:27.160]  create them in fact when you look at centralized societies like China which
[01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:30.760]  takes the brightest and smartest and allocates them into these kinds of
[01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:34.680]  projects that's where the danger well it's it's the danger of the military
[01:29:34.680 --> 01:29:38.800]  industrial complex and it's undue dangerous influence and Eisenhower went
[01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:44.640]  on to say run by a technocratic elite a technological technocratic elite stay
[01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:47.800]  there dr. Nick baggers long segment coming up let's keep rolling with this

[01:31:06.520 --> 01:31:11.560]  chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that we're
[01:31:11.560 --> 01:31:15.160]  pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've turned members
[01:31:15.160 --> 01:31:20.200]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:25.560]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:30.480]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[01:31:30.480 --> 01:31:34.880]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[01:31:34.880 --> 01:31:38.600]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more
[01:31:38.600 --> 01:31:42.560]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:48.200]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the
[01:31:48.200 --> 01:31:54.240]  Republic get your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info wars.com we're

[01:32:05.880 --> 01:32:09.920]  caused by fuel costs are spreading worldwide we're seeing the impact right
[01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:13.680]  here in the United States ethanol that was supposed to reduce petroleum use
[01:32:13.680 --> 01:32:18.680]  and fuel prices hit a 30 month high in February and pump prices are expected to
[01:32:18.680 --> 01:32:23.360]  reach $5 a gallon because of shipping costs food is being priced out of the
[01:32:23.360 --> 01:32:28.160]  reach of millions of Americans with an expected 35% jump in the next 60 days

[01:33:10.840 --> 01:33:18.200]  you can run on for long time dr. Nick baggage is our guest I hope you're
[01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:22.720]  listening to us very carefully because there are thousands and thousands and
[01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:26.400]  thousands of patents dealing with electromagnetic mind control I have
[01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:31.520]  personally only had time to read hundreds years ago I mean I had 12 14
[01:33:31.520 --> 01:33:35.400]  years ago I'd have dr. Nick baggage on about it he's written books on the
[01:33:35.400 --> 01:33:42.280]  subject available at info wars.com he has made films on the subject mind
[01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:48.040]  control a brave new world or enhancing human performance the issue here is it
[01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:54.880]  just like geoengineering we know it's going on they deny it and then now they
[01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:58.360]  suddenly declassify a bunch of it they admit it's going on they don't
[01:33:58.360 --> 01:34:02.760]  declassify the entire program and they tell people in USA today yes we're
[01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:06.840]  mixing stuff with the jets fuel and spraying but that part's secret and it's
[01:34:06.840 --> 01:34:11.640]  to keep you safe from the end of the earth because a global warming I mean
[01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:16.160]  what are they doing for 39 years in a global secret program taking blood from
[01:34:16.160 --> 01:34:22.160]  all babies at birth in every nation controlled by the globalist I mean what
[01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:25.840]  is going on there's this fake world we live in and then there's the
[01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:30.200]  technocratic world that they've really designed we're in this controlled
[01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:35.880]  reservation and yes these technologies could empower us I'm not an anti-
[01:34:35.880 --> 01:34:41.080]  technology troglodyte here I think it's great they can got systems now that are
[01:34:41.080 --> 01:34:44.480]  very expensive that's why the globalists want to have socialized health care so
[01:34:44.480 --> 01:34:48.960]  you can't get it they're now saying oh the case for killing granny we can hire
[01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:54.040]  20 teachers if we kill granny they socialize things so they can then sell
[01:34:54.040 --> 01:34:57.920]  you on destroying others to get something so they can play us off against
[01:34:57.920 --> 01:35:03.320]  each other not some type of utopian socialism but the the issue I'm getting
[01:35:03.320 --> 01:35:08.560]  here is with miniaturization with with technology with all of this this is all
[01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:11.720]  going to get cheaper and cheaper and cheaper for all of us the globalist
[01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:15.440]  want to put in a global dictatorship before that happens clamp down on the
[01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:21.320]  technology the general public can get sequester it in technological reservations
[01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:26.360]  corporations universities and government and only allow a select few to
[01:35:26.360 --> 01:35:30.080]  have it and in all their internal writings the stuff that's even public but
[01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:34.240]  not widely distributed they talk about we can't let the public know what we've
[01:35:34.240 --> 01:35:39.200]  got do we just entertain them and try to sterilize as many as we can or we just
[01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:43.120]  go ahead and do the right thing and wipe these people out that's what bill joy
[01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:47.600]  talks about in wire magazine owner of Sun Microsystems that's what Ted Turner
[01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:51.640]  Prince Philip that's why they're so arrogant and and I've talked to elitist
[01:35:51.640 --> 01:35:56.680]  off record and they say Alex people go well tell us who they are if I told you
[01:35:56.680 --> 01:36:00.640]  on record they never talked to me again but they're on record many of them
[01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:05.560]  writing saying look the people this is all admitted and they don't care they
[01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:10.000]  deserve to die well I don't deserve to die and the globalists say well then you
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:13.800]  should join us well number one you're a bunch of backstabbing scum I will not
[01:36:13.800 --> 01:36:18.400]  join in what you're doing but but the issue is dr. baggage here's my way of
[01:36:18.400 --> 01:36:23.520]  putting it if you take wild pigs or wild deer wild horses or wild bovine wild
[01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:28.960]  cows wild whatever the case is or domesticated and you put a poison in
[01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:32.880]  the water that they can even taste but it's the only water they're gonna go and
[01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:36.920]  they're gonna drink it and even as the cows and pigs die they're still so
[01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:41.560]  stupid they go and they drink it homo sapiens sapien is the only creature on
[01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:46.760]  this planet that we know of that well actually some insects would not drink
[01:36:46.760 --> 01:36:49.840]  it it's funny some of the lower animals but then honeybees do they're more like
[01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:54.240]  humans they'll still eat the BT corn and die but other animals won't but it's
[01:36:54.240 --> 01:36:58.160]  like they've poisoned the well there's they're turning up the ambient background
[01:36:58.160 --> 01:37:03.160]  noise of this system they're rolling all of this out against us I see it triggering
[01:37:03.160 --> 01:37:07.080]  I see it happening I see the bone cancer exploding from the fluoride the
[01:37:07.080 --> 01:37:10.440]  the brain cancer admitted from the cell phones in that exact area where you hold
[01:37:10.440 --> 01:37:16.320]  the phone the the the brain waves changing the IQ's dropping the globalist
[01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:21.200]  giggling and snickering as they do this I mean they're soft killing us now
[01:37:21.200 --> 01:37:24.880]  getting us into a catatonic mind-controlled state so when they
[01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:28.540]  really roll out the mass plagues and start killing the majority of us the
[01:37:28.540 --> 01:37:31.840]  public will watch their glowing telescreens at that point they'll flip
[01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:35.120]  on the high-powered stuff to just sit there in your house and wait for help
[01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:39.200]  as they fly over with airplanes pumping the bio weapon out I mean I can see
[01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:43.000]  their plan as clear as I saw them blowing those towers up two months before
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:47.320]  that happened I see this plan coming in the next decade or so if we don't get
[01:37:47.320 --> 01:37:50.040]  the word out dr. Beggart I know I'm ranting I want to hold you a little
[01:37:50.040 --> 01:37:53.200]  bit in the next hour if you can because I'm ranting you've got all the knowledge
[01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:58.320]  on this but every bone in my body every cell in my gut everything in the pit of
[01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:02.360]  my stomach my soul tells me and I have the evidence as you said most of this
[01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:06.040]  is public that there they've already rolled this out against us tell us what
[01:38:06.040 --> 01:38:09.640]  they've got what are your ideas to counter it do we try to get companies up
[01:38:09.640 --> 01:38:13.960]  to start scanning the TVs and things for these fields studying carrier waves
[01:38:13.960 --> 01:38:18.320]  did you companies come out with filters you put on your TV how do we stop the
[01:38:18.320 --> 01:38:21.560]  fluorescent light bulbs that they're trying to force us to take which they
[01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:25.240]  admit they're going to use to flicker control us you notice in government
[01:38:25.240 --> 01:38:28.520]  buildings is where they're starting with their own minions right you know this
[01:38:28.520 --> 01:38:32.360]  is all as you say it is being rolled out it's being used there's very little
[01:38:32.360 --> 01:38:37.240]  tech technology that that were protected from the idea of building
[01:38:37.240 --> 01:38:41.560]  filters or creating systems that would not allow this to something that actually
[01:38:41.560 --> 01:38:45.960]  did come up it came up by some of the originators of the technology back in
[01:38:45.960 --> 01:38:50.880]  the 80s to screen out signals from our adversaries but in so doing we screen
[01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:54.840]  out our own because these are it doesn't matter who's sending the signal the
[01:38:54.840 --> 01:38:59.600]  signal structure has to be the same in order to create the same biological or
[01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:04.040]  physiological or mental effects so how do they stop blowback well you know that
[01:39:04.040 --> 01:39:07.400]  you know that is the problem and I don't think they can't I think this
[01:39:07.400 --> 01:39:12.920]  technology is out of can and advancing fast enough furiously enough where
[01:39:12.920 --> 01:39:17.920]  there's there's enough independent work that ultimately the question of how
[01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:23.760]  much are they going to tell us how much danger of our own because I can tell
[01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:28.360]  you that every system that we have that could be effectively used as a carrier
[01:39:28.360 --> 01:39:33.960]  can be used by both commercial interests governmental interest it's not so
[01:39:33.960 --> 01:39:39.080]  much worrying about just some big brother with the command and control of
[01:39:39.080 --> 01:39:44.440]  huge technology it's got flatter meaning more and more access to these kinds of
[01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:49.360]  systems the flip side is this is it in all of the research that I've done on
[01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:53.240]  this subject the one thing that the military and other researchers discovered
[01:39:53.240 --> 01:39:58.720]  is a bit about the human potential or what they now call anomalous human
[01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:01.960]  capabilities these things that never they could explain you know mental
[01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:06.640]  telepathy how does that work well now they're actually developing systems to
[01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:11.960]  synthesize they have figured out how that works thinking about some of the
[01:40:11.960 --> 01:40:16.840]  bizarre things that were relegated to the paranormal or to the religious
[01:40:16.840 --> 01:40:22.080]  experiences of people there are physiological explanation meanwhile the
[01:40:22.080 --> 01:40:25.520]  globalists tell the public none of this exists because they want you to be
[01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:30.840]  psychically or spiritually blind meanwhile they've quantified it in tens of
[01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:34.800]  thousands of studies everybody's got it some people got a lot of it they've
[01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:40.000]  tried to develop psychic boosters all of that right but we all have all of this
[01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:44.040]  latent capacity it's our creative birthright you know we're created I
[01:40:44.040 --> 01:40:48.320]  believe in the image of a creator and science is proving more and more that
[01:40:48.320 --> 01:40:52.720]  human beings are much more that than we have ever thought about in terms of
[01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:56.520]  being just some but the globalists know that that's why everything they do is
[01:40:56.520 --> 01:41:00.040]  trying to suppress human potential that's right and the easiest and the most
[01:41:00.040 --> 01:41:04.920]  effective actually is through fear and worry because if you look at an EEG
[01:41:04.920 --> 01:41:10.800]  that the mapping of the brain actively engaged in fear or worry or these kinds
[01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:15.080]  of emotions you get incoherent bright brain patterns it's the kind that don't
[01:41:15.080 --> 01:41:19.400]  line up with this higher-ordered experiential thinking and more
[01:41:19.400 --> 01:41:22.880]  intellectual thinking when you get a whole brain coherent where both
[01:41:22.880 --> 01:41:27.120]  hemispheres of the brain work together they say that you can hit an ultimate
[01:41:27.120 --> 01:41:32.240]  unlimited IQ if you can achieve that and there are technologies that are
[01:41:32.240 --> 01:41:36.960]  advancing that allow us to achieve that and when you start to think about what
[01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:42.320]  our potentials are and heading in that direction scares the hell out of elitist
[01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:47.840]  from the standpoint that what do you do with billions of self-actualized fully
[01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:54.200]  engaged humans on a planet like this you unmask the deceit you unmask the fear
[01:41:54.200 --> 01:41:59.360]  and you liberate the human consciousness is what happens the exact opposite of
[01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:03.560]  what are established orders in the world today would like to see happen and
[01:42:03.560 --> 01:42:08.440]  that is what needs to happen and I believe that is the coming evolution of
[01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:13.000]  humankind we are going to experience that in the 21st century either is going
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:18.520]  to be stripped from us by a an elitist controlled and directed society or we're
[01:42:18.520 --> 01:42:22.520]  going to liberate ourselves and recognize what we are and our science is
[01:42:22.520 --> 01:42:27.760]  going to support that and allow us to advance to that level that I think we
[01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:31.920]  are all destined to move towards I really believe that and I think this
[01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:37.600]  generation we can shake off the fear but man it's going to be a rocky road over
[01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:40.960]  the next few years and we have to be vigilant we have to stay calm and we
[01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:45.640]  have to stay directed well that's my point here is that I don't come at this
[01:42:45.640 --> 01:42:50.920]  from a position of fear I come at it from a position of extreme action and
[01:42:50.920 --> 01:42:56.920]  resistance right but when I'm at home or researching I'm very calm my mind is
[01:42:56.920 --> 01:43:01.400]  focused I have complete maps with the integrated information I have of
[01:43:01.400 --> 01:43:08.400]  basically enemy operations but then verbally it's so hard to articulate the
[01:43:08.400 --> 01:43:13.000]  full connections the clarity that you can see the sophisticated enemy
[01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:17.920]  operations I mean years after I've already envisioned something I can read
[01:43:17.920 --> 01:43:21.800]  declassified globalist handbooks you name it it's word for word what I've
[01:43:21.800 --> 01:43:26.120]  already envisioned because humans are so similar they're just working from a
[01:43:26.120 --> 01:43:31.440]  position of using it for bad I've been able to see how they're using it and
[01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:35.880]  and you know hopefully trying to change it but I found though were the reason my
[01:43:35.880 --> 01:43:40.640]  show successful is that for people who are in a mind-controlled state people
[01:43:40.640 --> 01:43:45.440]  who are totally locked in for whatever reason you talk to most people of
[01:43:45.440 --> 01:43:49.680]  anybody out there they'll say who woke you up it's Alex Jones yeah and I think
[01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:53.760]  it's because I am intellectual I'm intelligent probably not as intelligent
[01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:58.960]  as somebody like yourself but I'm also have that primitive drive and in an
[01:43:58.960 --> 01:44:03.280]  instinctive level the biggest mind controller out there is the truth
[01:44:03.280 --> 01:44:07.720]  people go with that they can feel the instinctive tribal truth of what I'm
[01:44:07.720 --> 01:44:13.240]  saying and so I'm able to do the initial phase of getting people broken out of
[01:44:13.240 --> 01:44:18.000]  their trance so that not through fear but by saying hey your house is on fire
[01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:22.800]  that's not fear we need to do something about that how do you quantify what I'm
[01:44:22.800 --> 01:44:26.480]  trying to say there well you know I think that's exactly right right right on
[01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:29.760]  target because it's the you know if you think about all the things that have
[01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:34.000]  ever altered our course in life I mean you can think about everyone who has a
[01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:39.000]  little gray hair can identify with us is it's usually during the trauma during
[01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:43.920]  the shocks during the wake-up calls that it's never it's very rarely through
[01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:47.760]  those high emotional states when everything's running well the same is
[01:44:47.760 --> 01:44:51.920]  true here I think that all of us by delivering information it does shock
[01:44:51.920 --> 01:44:56.160]  the consciousness and and it should because it should awaken people to the
[01:44:56.160 --> 01:45:00.320]  possibilities of what's out there but then quickly moving from there to saying
[01:45:00.320 --> 01:45:05.560]  alright now that we know something we do not we're not powerless anymore and
[01:45:05.560 --> 01:45:09.680]  it's taken that first step and having that resolve when you start having a
[01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:14.400]  little successes little Trentons then you can win the bigger wars right that's
[01:45:14.400 --> 01:45:17.840]  exactly it you know and I'll tell you where where it's really important because
[01:45:17.840 --> 01:45:21.920]  that and you've led a lot of activist life and I have to we watched a lot of our
[01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:26.680]  friends and colleagues fall by the way start wayside when they succumb and let
[01:45:26.680 --> 01:45:31.040]  fear overtake them and and it is one step at a time you know we each have a
[01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:34.880]  sphere of influence out there all of us do and if if we execute against that
[01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:38.480]  whether it's talking to our friends or families whether it's this issue or
[01:45:38.480 --> 01:45:43.480]  another issue engage the world around us in a positive way about what we're
[01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:48.160]  passionate about and that passion will carry us up forward in a much more
[01:45:48.160 --> 01:45:53.040]  positive way and when it when it gets too overwhelming back off maybe it's the
[01:45:53.040 --> 01:45:57.280]  met maybe it's the burden for their for your partner to carry you know not
[01:45:57.280 --> 01:46:00.960]  everyone has to carry at all and there's a lot of us out there there's what I
[01:46:00.960 --> 01:46:05.880]  believe the most powerful source of a solution here is what I call the
[01:46:05.880 --> 01:46:10.000]  organic internet that's you and me ladies and gentlemen and we already are
[01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:13.240]  connected we're connected by the human spirit something no one else can
[01:46:13.240 --> 01:46:17.080]  interfere with in the in the profound ways they can with all of our other
[01:46:17.080 --> 01:46:24.200]  man-made system the fact is we are in a unique club on the planet we don't have
[01:46:24.200 --> 01:46:28.840]  to wait for leadership to arise it already has it's in each one of our
[01:46:28.840 --> 01:46:33.720]  yes created souls we just have to but the globalists sell the lie of an Arnold
[01:46:33.720 --> 01:46:38.000]  Schwarzenegger a man on a white horse fixing everything so that people feel
[01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:42.400]  inadequate the small Madison Avenue's first tool they admit is to make you
[01:46:42.400 --> 01:46:46.880]  feel inadequate so they can sell you their crutches the truth is you're not
[01:46:46.880 --> 01:46:50.840]  inadequate you're not an underachiever you have incredible power but realize
[01:46:50.840 --> 01:46:55.540]  it's it's Rome wasn't built in a day the journey of a thousand miles starts
[01:46:55.540 --> 01:47:00.760]  with a single step start little so many activists overthink it in my 16 year
[01:47:00.760 --> 01:47:06.240]  battle we've had devastating effects on the globalist by empowering people it's
[01:47:06.240 --> 01:47:10.800]  our listeners are the real power of this show it's the same thing with your 20
[01:47:10.800 --> 01:47:15.840]  years of fighting dr. baggage I mean it's had just unbelievable effects well
[01:47:15.840 --> 01:47:20.040]  and you know a lot of me don't even you don't even plan for that the beauty of
[01:47:20.040 --> 01:47:23.920]  it all is and that some of the things that people have equated as small have
[01:47:23.920 --> 01:47:27.880]  actually been the most important things that that have happened to us I mean we
[01:47:27.880 --> 01:47:33.440]  had a guy in a mailroom once that reached out to a publisher in Germany
[01:47:33.440 --> 01:47:37.960]  that reached out touch somebody in the right political place and that chain of
[01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:42.680]  events started with just someone doing something allowed us to get this issue
[01:47:42.680 --> 01:47:46.800]  in front of eventually the European Parliament I can trace it back to one
[01:47:46.800 --> 01:47:50.680]  event that somebody said was small and it reminded me of the story of the
[01:47:50.680 --> 01:47:54.880]  widows might and many will remember that you know this this is the person that
[01:47:54.880 --> 01:47:59.680]  gave what they had toward the effort they were engaged in and what happened it
[01:47:59.680 --> 01:48:03.240]  was so much bigger than the wealth of so many others and that's how we have to
[01:48:03.240 --> 01:48:08.480]  look at our individual action what we do does indeed matter and there are no
[01:48:08.480 --> 01:48:12.640]  small things and you know in all of this that the idea of controlling the mind
[01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:18.400]  that's where it starts by us choosing where we're headed and begin to map our
[01:48:18.400 --> 01:48:22.640]  yes getting there that well instead of being intimidated by knowing this is
[01:48:22.640 --> 01:48:27.000]  rolling out be glad that dr. baggage is there to warn you be glad we're here now
[01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:31.680]  warn others don't just stop there but also realize why do they want to put
[01:48:31.680 --> 01:48:35.720]  something Mr. Coney and in because they're scared of you because you've
[01:48:35.720 --> 01:48:41.160]  got a chance to beat them because you got power that's exactly it and it is
[01:48:41.160 --> 01:48:45.840]  that realization all the work I've done in researching the mind effects that
[01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:49.800]  conclusion that military and intelligence communities reached that
[01:48:49.800 --> 01:48:53.840]  wow if people knew how to do this stuff we'd really be in trouble and they
[01:48:53.840 --> 01:48:59.160]  would be because a fully actualized population that understands what each of
[01:48:59.160 --> 01:49:03.400]  us is capable of changes the playing field dramatically and that's where
[01:49:03.400 --> 01:49:06.840]  we're at and that's that this generation's choices will determine
[01:49:06.840 --> 01:49:12.040]  whether we live in a free and liberated society in terms of our basic human
[01:49:12.040 --> 01:49:17.600]  rights or whether we're trampled on in a in an increasingly a technocratic
[01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:22.200]  slavery and that's what I see and it's not a question of speculation it's
[01:49:22.200 --> 01:49:26.600]  based on really firm research in the books that we've written over 1600
[01:49:26.600 --> 01:49:30.840]  sources were cited these aren't conversations in the closet these are
[01:49:30.840 --> 01:49:36.920]  mainstream first-rate sources that people can look at and evaluate and they
[01:49:36.920 --> 01:49:41.640]  in the flip side of this is there are some really incredible technologies that
[01:49:41.640 --> 01:49:45.520]  are advancing that will change the way in which we look at the human body and
[01:49:45.520 --> 01:49:48.760]  human consciousness the way we heal the body for many well that's why the
[01:49:48.760 --> 01:49:52.840]  globalists as you are in a race to clamp all this down under this global
[01:49:52.840 --> 01:49:56.840]  dictatorships so they don't have to give us all of this we've almost reached the
[01:49:56.840 --> 01:50:00.400]  point where they're not going to be in control you know and that's exactly it
[01:50:00.400 --> 01:50:04.920]  because it doesn't take and this is the other realization it doesn't take that
[01:50:04.920 --> 01:50:12.600]  many it doesn't take the 50% plus one to change the dynamic every major social
[01:50:12.600 --> 01:50:17.600]  economic political scientific change that ever occurred on the planet started
[01:50:17.600 --> 01:50:21.520]  with one or two people just seeing it a little differently and there are way way
[01:50:21.520 --> 01:50:25.240]  more than that seeing it a little bit differently these days and I think that's
[01:50:25.240 --> 01:50:28.960]  where in the great hope lies you know what what people are rebelling around
[01:50:28.960 --> 01:50:34.440]  around the world again right now it's not just you know economics it's about
[01:50:34.440 --> 01:50:40.040]  corruption it's about liberty it's about choosing self-determination even though
[01:50:40.040 --> 01:50:44.080]  it may not line up with exactly what we think the right way they're rebelling
[01:50:44.080 --> 01:50:49.720]  against arrogance in government the the the the the overall darkness of it as
[01:50:49.720 --> 01:50:53.760]  the system tries to sell classical tyranny all over the planet as if it's
[01:50:53.760 --> 01:50:57.760]  good they're trying to rebrand it and psychologically break our will I see it
[01:50:57.760 --> 01:51:03.040]  backfiring dr. Beggar stay with us hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the
[01:51:03.040 --> 01:51:06.960]  global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the
[01:51:06.960 --> 01:51:10.720]  Arctic Circle did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could
[01:51:10.720 --> 01:51:14.400]  become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds that all perform even
[01:51:14.400 --> 01:51:17.680]  gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen
[01:51:17.680 --> 01:51:21.760]  again so our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect
[01:51:21.760 --> 01:51:27.160]  mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an

[01:53:03.840 --> 01:53:08.040]  taste that good have artificial flavors sweeteners or unhealthy sugars about a
[01:53:08.040 --> 01:53:11.880]  year ago I was introduced to a new protein powder that changed my experience
[01:53:11.880 --> 01:53:15.200]  this protein powder made me feel noticeably better and it tasted more
[01:53:15.200 --> 01:53:19.600]  delicious than any drink I've ever had here's the experience of one satisfied

[01:54:23.360 --> 01:54:34.880]  the whole left-right issue in Wisconsin the beginning of austerity we laid it
[01:54:34.880 --> 01:54:39.120]  all out we know how it's gonna unfold the globalists are gonna play the
[01:54:39.120 --> 01:54:43.600]  government workers and other union workers off against what's left of the
[01:54:43.600 --> 01:54:48.280]  free market population having us fight with each other instead of looking at
[01:54:48.280 --> 01:54:52.560]  the big mega banks that have already sucked this country and countless other
[01:54:52.560 --> 01:54:58.120]  nations dry over and over again see Michael Moore says oh the big banks are
[01:54:58.120 --> 01:55:04.640]  corrupt we need to get the money it's a it's a national resource but they're
[01:55:04.640 --> 01:55:08.640]  gonna get our money and transfer to the bankers why do you think Hollywood
[01:55:08.640 --> 01:55:11.840]  finances him why do you think he's worth hundreds and hundreds of millions of
[01:55:11.840 --> 01:55:17.640]  dollars he's a cold-blooded operative who knows full well what he's doing so
[01:55:17.640 --> 01:55:21.600]  does Glenn Beck and I'm gonna break all this down coming up okay if you really
[01:55:21.600 --> 01:55:26.200]  want to know and by the way there's these conservatives out there when the
[01:55:26.200 --> 01:55:29.280]  liberals they're not even liberals are saying you don't have a right to your own
[01:55:29.280 --> 01:55:32.920]  money which means you're a slave the guys like well you don't make a thing of
[01:55:32.920 --> 01:55:37.240]  value and they go what do you do the guys a defense contractor he's on the
[01:55:37.240 --> 01:55:43.840]  government feed as well which is what Eisenhower warned about it just it's a
[01:55:43.840 --> 01:55:47.640]  tiny group running at all this is not a free market but Dr. Beck is with us for
[01:55:47.640 --> 01:55:51.360]  about 20 more minutes now not Dr. Bears we talked about the sum of the negative
[01:55:51.360 --> 01:55:54.920]  some of the positive but let's go through some more patents some more systems of
[01:55:54.920 --> 01:56:00.540]  mind control the carrier waves on cell phones the coupling with the eyes and the
[01:56:00.540 --> 01:56:05.040]  television set what's going on how they can manipulate other psychotronic ways
[01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:09.720]  they're controlling us well if you think about modulating a signal off on
[01:56:09.720 --> 01:56:13.720]  television let me just explain a couple of simple ways that that that works
[01:56:13.720 --> 01:56:19.600]  basically the light the light emitted from a TV if you go into a dark room and
[01:56:19.600 --> 01:56:23.280]  you look at the white wall behind you don't look at the TV look at where it's
[01:56:23.280 --> 01:56:27.320]  where it's projecting and you'll see the light flicker you know you'll notice that
[01:56:27.320 --> 01:56:33.560]  if you can maintain a specific pulse rate for just a few seconds 10 15 seconds
[01:56:33.560 --> 01:56:37.440]  the brain will begin to follow that it's a pretty it's called a frequency
[01:56:37.440 --> 01:56:41.400]  following response and whether it's coming in through the optic nerve through
[01:56:41.400 --> 01:56:45.120]  the eye by the flicker of the light or you can do it through sound by
[01:56:45.120 --> 01:56:49.000]  engineering sound in a very specific way you can create the same kind of effect
[01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:53.360]  you can also do it with electromagnetic currents or electromagnetic fields that
[01:56:53.360 --> 01:56:58.000]  you're in close proximity to but what happens is the brain locks onto that
[01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:02.800]  external signal begins to mirror it and so you can actually put someone in
[01:57:02.800 --> 01:57:08.160]  either a highly agitated state if you chose to maybe right before the broadcast
[01:57:08.160 --> 01:57:11.440]  news where you're going to indict a certain political group or a certain
[01:57:11.440 --> 01:57:15.080]  faction of our community against one another and all of a sudden you've got
[01:57:15.080 --> 01:57:19.680]  all this anger being directed at you know maybe a situation normally you
[01:57:19.680 --> 01:57:24.600]  wouldn't direct it at all or even more simply putting you in a more passive
[01:57:24.600 --> 01:57:29.640]  almost a trans like state where you can then deliver information just deliver
[01:57:29.640 --> 01:57:33.240]  the news just deliver the commercial just deliver the soap opera whatever it is
[01:57:33.240 --> 01:57:37.320]  that you're being programmed with because the mind will absorb that and
[01:57:37.320 --> 01:57:41.720]  literally accept the program and and that is what you're doing you know it's
[01:57:41.720 --> 01:57:46.880]  almost it's almost humorous if you think about you're watching the program
[01:57:46.880 --> 01:57:51.040]  you'd not talk about programming routinely when you talk about television
[01:57:51.040 --> 01:57:55.280]  but you never really think about the fact that you were being programmed you
[01:57:55.280 --> 01:58:00.480]  know I'm my wife and I are raising our grandchild and I joke about a little
[01:58:00.480 --> 01:58:03.560]  bit you know because the messaging that you give a four-year-old and a three-
[01:58:03.560 --> 01:58:08.520]  year-old a two-year-old is essentially human programming it's based on your
[01:58:08.520 --> 01:58:13.200]  emotions and your delivery and how you do it but we do it as parents we do it as
[01:58:13.200 --> 01:58:18.360]  grandparents we do we do it all the time but when it's done to us in a way
[01:58:18.360 --> 01:58:25.320]  that engineered for a result is that manipulation no it's slavery and and
[01:58:25.320 --> 01:58:30.000]  there's one thing with ancient human instincts that's our base programming to
[01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:33.720]  pass on what's common sense and good for us the globalists are giving us
[01:58:33.720 --> 01:58:39.320]  artificial programming covertly to hurt us and it's absolutely criminal we'll be
[01:58:39.320 --> 01:58:49.960]  right back at one minute you are listening to GCN visit GCNLive.com today
[01:58:49.960 --> 01:58:55.760]  a very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most
[01:58:55.760 --> 01:59:00.240]  important day in America in more than 50 years he says it will change everything
[01:59:00.240 --> 01:59:04.680]  about our lives the way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children and even
[01:59:04.680 --> 01:59:08.040]  how you take care of your health and your own family now this man has made some
[01:59:08.040 --> 01:59:12.320]  outrageous predictions over the years the crazy part is he's usually right you
[01:59:12.320 --> 01:59:16.240]  see he predicted the collapse of GM Panny May, Freddie Mac and America's
[01:59:16.240 --> 01:59:20.120]  biggest small-owner general growth properties in fact Barron's called his
[01:59:20.120 --> 01:59:24.600]  work a dire prophecy recently he created a video which you can watch online for
[01:59:24.600 --> 01:59:28.240]  free detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet and it's a real
[01:59:28.240 --> 01:59:32.400]  eye-opener I can't stress this enough you should at least watch this free video
[01:59:32.400 --> 01:59:36.120]  online today he explains everything you need to know including simple steps you
[01:59:36.120 --> 01:59:41.920]  can take to protect yourself you can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com

[02:00:04.680 --> 02:00:12.520]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[02:00:12.520 --> 02:00:20.080]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:20.080 --> 02:00:26.040]  Alex Jones okay I've asked my questions I've made my points he's one of the type
[02:00:26.040 --> 02:00:30.560]  of guest that really gets me raving because it's just so many thoughts go
[02:00:30.560 --> 02:00:34.480]  through my mind but in this short segment and for the next Dr. Baggots let's
[02:00:34.480 --> 02:00:40.000]  get into more of these technologies more of these control systems where you see
[02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:45.120]  this you know moving to how it's unfolding why do we see the media
[02:00:45.120 --> 02:00:49.280]  starting to talk about it so much does that mean that there is a rollout of
[02:00:49.280 --> 02:00:53.040]  this about to happen as they try to normalize it Dr. Baggots you've got
[02:00:53.040 --> 02:00:56.320]  the floor yeah I think it is about normalizing it you know because the
[02:00:56.320 --> 02:01:00.760]  warnings were issued long ago you know even the economists which people see as
[02:01:00.760 --> 02:01:06.480]  one of the more prestigious magazines in the world their cover story in May 2002
[02:01:06.480 --> 02:01:11.040]  now that's you know that's nine years ago and the cover story was called the
[02:01:11.040 --> 02:01:16.680]  future of mind control and it and it's got a head with a combination lock in
[02:01:16.680 --> 02:01:21.280]  the center of the skull and and that's exactly where we're at and that article
[02:01:21.280 --> 02:01:24.600]  was about the ethics of it which is just where we were before the break you know
[02:01:24.600 --> 02:01:28.840]  this whole concept that when's it right when's it wrong there used to be a book
[02:01:28.840 --> 02:01:33.040]  years ago it's been out of print it was called mind man the manipulator and it
[02:01:33.040 --> 02:01:36.800]  explains the difference between persuasion and manipulation persuasion is
[02:01:36.800 --> 02:01:40.240]  you know what the country was really based on it was the idea that you would
[02:01:40.240 --> 02:01:43.840]  have political vibrant political debate the right of assembly free speech
[02:01:43.840 --> 02:01:48.640]  freedom of religion all these things that create the environment of free
[02:01:48.640 --> 02:01:53.920]  thinking individuals that have a right to some level of self-determination that's
[02:01:53.920 --> 02:01:58.000]  sort of the foundation under which this country formed and a lot of the thinking
[02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:02.880]  that we started with formed and I say thinking because in those days whether
[02:02:02.880 --> 02:02:07.120]  you were the shopkeeper the butcher the baker the candlestick maker you
[02:02:07.120 --> 02:02:10.960]  participated in your government in fact you were probably all of those things
[02:02:10.960 --> 02:02:16.320]  and had those skills just to function as normal human being a few hundred years
[02:02:16.320 --> 02:02:21.920]  ago today our skill sets are so different the idea of being able to
[02:02:21.920 --> 02:02:26.080]  survive independently that is not the creation of business school you know
[02:02:26.080 --> 02:02:31.760]  business schools create dependence and and and and and that requirement where
[02:02:31.760 --> 02:02:35.920]  you really don't have freedom where you're you're literally pushed directions
[02:02:35.920 --> 02:02:40.920]  all through the day from the time you wake up until you sleep at night that is
[02:02:40.920 --> 02:02:46.720]  so contrary to our basic nature number one at the same time when you look at
[02:02:46.720 --> 02:02:52.080]  the amount of change that's on our horizon and what's coming I mean we
[02:02:52.080 --> 02:02:57.560]  anyone who's lived 50 years has seen the revolution you know in terms of
[02:02:57.560 --> 02:03:02.680]  technology but you have seen nothing yet everything you've seen from the
[02:03:02.680 --> 02:03:07.120]  invention of the wheel to where we are today will be repeated every nine months
[02:03:07.120 --> 02:03:12.320]  or so from here on out and getting smaller and tighter and faster because of
[02:03:12.320 --> 02:03:16.240]  our computing power our ability to process information and this is where I
[02:03:16.240 --> 02:03:20.720]  was speaking earlier about resolution you know being able to see things more
[02:03:20.720 --> 02:03:25.320]  clearly influence things more clearly requires a higher and higher degree of
[02:03:25.320 --> 02:03:29.720]  resolution in terms of our circuitry and the fineness of that circuitry to
[02:03:29.720 --> 02:03:35.320]  discern these very minute and unusual signals that now we're not only able to
[02:03:35.320 --> 02:03:39.800]  discern but we're able to manipulate whether it's the activity within our
[02:03:39.800 --> 02:03:44.640]  brains that fit a very specific pattern when you're having very specific
[02:03:44.640 --> 02:03:48.440]  thoughts and the idea of transferring those from one human being to another
[02:03:48.440 --> 02:03:52.920]  right now DARPA has two contracts in the University of California operating
[02:03:52.920 --> 02:03:58.160]  today that are to determine how that mechanism works for creating artificial
[02:03:58.160 --> 02:04:03.560]  telepathy but I can tell you there was work done in 1985 and I've seen the
[02:04:03.560 --> 02:04:09.640]  the unpublished work by one of the best in this field in the world and in 85 they
[02:04:09.640 --> 02:04:14.920]  were able to take nine test subjects in two separate rooms and transfer
[02:04:14.920 --> 02:04:19.840]  information from one mind to the other accurately and they were using the cards
[02:04:19.840 --> 02:04:23.120]  that show squares and circles and rectangles and all these different shapes
[02:04:23.120 --> 02:04:27.840]  and with a hundred percent accuracy with people had no previous knowledge that
[02:04:27.840 --> 02:04:32.000]  they had this capacity using an electronic apparatus were able to do it
[02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:35.240]  and that's why the globalists don't want us to have our own morals our own
[02:04:35.240 --> 02:04:39.200]  compass that's why they don't want parents when kids are young to put your
[02:04:39.200 --> 02:04:43.560]  own ideas in them could they say oh later could be themselves that so they
[02:04:43.560 --> 02:04:46.960]  can do all the programming and teach them how to fail teach them how to
[02:04:46.960 --> 02:04:51.200]  commit suicide which they admit the anti-suicide education has made it go
[02:04:51.200 --> 02:04:55.400]  off the charts so they increase the funding because it's not failing it's
[02:04:55.400 --> 02:05:00.160]  succeeding they come to kill steal and destroy stay there dr. baggage more
[02:05:00.160 --> 02:05:03.400]  straight ahead my folks this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your
[02:05:03.400 --> 02:05:07.640]  time to tell you about so not detergents but good old-fashioned pure soap made by
[02:05:07.640 --> 02:05:12.080]  the Calvin soap company a family owned and operated American company my family
[02:05:12.080 --> 02:05:16.240]  staff friends and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love
[02:05:16.240 --> 02:05:19.840]  these products for bath hair laundry and dishes there is nothing like these
[02:05:19.840 --> 02:05:24.160]  factory direct big money saving triple concentrated soaps anywhere get a free

[02:05:34.640 --> 02:05:36.640]  Schachter and see what he has to say
[02:05:36.640 --> 02:05:52.440]  as founder and owner for over 63 years people keep asking me how's business I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain call us at 1-800-340-7091
[02:05:52.440 --> 02:06:04.800]  you've heard Alex explain how the silver lungs generator infuses the
[02:06:04.800 --> 02:06:08.760]  respiratory system with yourself produced colloidal silver solutions yet
[02:06:08.760 --> 02:06:12.200]  many are unaware of the entire function of the silver lung system and how it has
[02:06:12.200 --> 02:06:17.040]  been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body my
[02:06:17.040 --> 02:06:20.040]  name is Mario Sephalde and I'm the developer of the silver lungs
[02:06:20.040 --> 02:06:24.360]  generator not only does the silver lung system produce endless colloidal and
[02:06:24.360 --> 02:06:28.720]  ionic silver solutions it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and
[02:06:28.720 --> 02:06:33.600]  devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas
[02:06:33.600 --> 02:06:40.760]  this includes the eyes ears nose lungs topically to the skin and orally for the
[02:06:40.760 --> 02:06:44.880]  digestive system be sure to watch our new seven-minute video tour of the silver
[02:06:44.880 --> 02:06:51.200]  lung system at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the silver lung
[02:06:51.200 --> 02:06:55.880]  system works as well we are always ready to answer any questions you may have
[02:06:55.880 --> 02:07:02.520]  that's www.silverlungs.com this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you
[02:07:02.520 --> 02:07:06.400]  should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate
[02:07:06.400 --> 02:07:10.360]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new
[02:07:10.360 --> 02:07:14.280]  energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[02:07:14.280 --> 02:07:18.520]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[02:07:18.520 --> 02:07:22.960]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[02:07:22.960 --> 02:07:27.680]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[02:07:27.680 --> 02:07:31.480]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[02:07:31.480 --> 02:07:35.120]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[02:07:35.120 --> 02:07:39.480]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[02:07:39.480 --> 02:07:42.720]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar powered
[02:07:42.720 --> 02:07:46.280]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you
[02:07:46.280 --> 02:07:51.080]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's my solar
[02:07:51.080 --> 02:07:55.320]  backup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to my solar
[02:07:55.320 --> 02:08:05.720]  backup.com or call 1-877-327-0365 ease the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on
[02:08:05.720 --> 02:08:16.360]  the GCN radio network we go back to the 1950s there were many cases of the CIA
[02:08:16.360 --> 02:08:21.880]  testing LSD and other drugs on suspecting members of the public
[02:08:21.880 --> 02:08:28.960]  dropping it in their drinks giving it to their own military personnel you know
[02:08:28.960 --> 02:08:34.600]  all the examples of declassified times when they would nerve gas our own
[02:08:34.600 --> 02:08:39.920]  troops I mean it's about playing God and shifting gears into an interesting
[02:08:39.920 --> 02:08:43.840]  area with dr. Nick baggage talking about mind control all of his great books
[02:08:43.840 --> 02:08:48.000]  and videos available at info wars calm controlling the human mind the
[02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:53.280]  technologies of political control or tools for peak performance angels don't

[02:09:07.920 --> 02:09:11.840]  sent him a video Skype camera and stuff you may be seeing dr. Nick baggage he's
[02:09:11.840 --> 02:09:17.000]  fixing his he's changing offices right now guest hosting some of the near
[02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:21.600]  future she'll be able to hear him unbridled without my interjections but
[02:09:21.600 --> 02:09:25.840]  but but Charlie Sheen the Charlie Sheen I've known a lot of people that know him
[02:09:25.840 --> 02:09:31.840]  well have said man he's a quiet nice humble guy who's really giving all the
[02:09:31.840 --> 02:09:36.360]  sudden he seems really wild I mean could it be that he was sober for almost a
[02:09:36.360 --> 02:09:41.240]  decade then went back on stuff for seven months now he's kind of manic when I got
[02:09:41.240 --> 02:09:43.960]  him on a few weeks ago I wasn't expecting that because when I was at his
[02:09:43.960 --> 02:09:50.120]  house a week before that he wasn't manic now you know I I told him I said
[02:09:50.120 --> 02:09:53.720]  they're gonna fire you and I said you need to try to you know even though
[02:09:53.720 --> 02:09:56.480]  they've been attacking you and stuff you need to try to get along with them but
[02:09:56.480 --> 02:10:00.120]  but more and more I look at some of these Hollywood stars and and and you
[02:10:00.120 --> 02:10:03.480]  have to ask I mean it's a great example of not just government people but folks
[02:10:03.480 --> 02:10:07.880]  that are due to be paid 200 plus million dollars you know does somebody want to
[02:10:07.880 --> 02:10:11.400]  cheat him out of that is somebody slipping a Mickey in his drink is there
[02:10:11.400 --> 02:10:14.800]  some type of psychotronic thing going on because I've been there when he's
[02:10:14.800 --> 02:10:18.440]  getting blood tests and urine tests that he is off drugs or is it just he's
[02:10:18.440 --> 02:10:22.640]  manic or what's going on I mean any views on that well you know there's I
[02:10:22.640 --> 02:10:28.080]  can tell you that you see it in a lot of people right now and that it you know
[02:10:28.080 --> 02:10:33.480]  the swings of you know of emotions and and if you look at a lot of the
[02:10:33.480 --> 02:10:37.720]  underlying factors I think are these stressors that we're talking about you
[02:10:37.720 --> 02:10:42.800]  know that the fact that people who didn't use cell phones who didn't have a
[02:10:42.800 --> 02:10:46.560]  wireless world surrounding them at the level in which we do now I mean how much
[02:10:46.560 --> 02:10:50.320]  stress is that creating for individual systems that breaks out
[02:10:50.320 --> 02:10:54.920]  occasionally and in irrational way I was about to say he lives on his cell
[02:10:54.920 --> 02:10:59.320]  phone and they admit that cell phones ABC news increased brain activity and
[02:10:59.320 --> 02:11:05.040]  almost create a manic like state right and so why expect anything else and and
[02:11:05.040 --> 02:11:08.480]  look at the population across the population we have more people on
[02:11:08.480 --> 02:11:14.320]  psychoactive drugs because of some depression or illness and you know I
[02:11:14.320 --> 02:11:19.000]  can tell you you know where I live I live in in a very dark place Alaska the
[02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:23.560]  winter it's horrible you know and it affects me profoundly I can tell you and
[02:11:23.560 --> 02:11:29.600]  if it wasn't for some level of vitamin D supplements I would be a total wreck
[02:11:29.600 --> 02:11:34.240]  and most people are vitamin D deficient that's another article that ran finally
[02:11:34.240 --> 02:11:39.360]  recently in the news we've been saying it for years check your D levels most
[02:11:39.360 --> 02:11:42.640]  people work in cubicle world today they don't even get in the sun and when they
[02:11:42.640 --> 02:11:46.640]  do they're so screen blocked they don't get any sun and vitamin D is leading to
[02:11:46.640 --> 02:11:50.680]  more depression and then you they on top of that electromagnetic field
[02:11:50.680 --> 02:11:56.400]  interference and the chemicals that we ingest and anything less then then
[02:11:56.400 --> 02:12:01.000]  manic behavior from time to time would be the exception and I'll tell you when
[02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:04.880]  you really notice it is when the power grid fails in your area you notice how
[02:12:04.880 --> 02:12:10.480]  quiet it gets but you also notice your whole body takes an exhale your whole
[02:12:10.480 --> 02:12:15.160]  body relaxes as you quit compensating for those external fields that are there
[02:12:15.160 --> 02:12:19.480]  like background noise in a crowded room it's what you were talking about earlier
[02:12:19.480 --> 02:12:23.200]  in the program Alex goodie out of that in the country in a remote place where
[02:12:23.200 --> 02:12:27.320]  you're away from it how much better do you feel unless you're from New York
[02:12:27.320 --> 02:12:33.000]  City you know this proves it because I'm not consciously thinking about what
[02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:36.360]  you're saying at the time but over my life whenever there's a city-wide black
[02:12:36.360 --> 02:12:41.480]  out it cuts off and it's not just the excitement of power being off you walk
[02:12:41.480 --> 02:12:46.880]  outside whether it's day or night and you suddenly just oh I feel so good it's
[02:12:46.880 --> 02:12:52.880]  like magic that's the field isn't it it is and it is and we and we because we're
[02:12:52.880 --> 02:12:56.880]  in it there's an old Chinese saying you know what the sound of being born and
[02:12:56.880 --> 02:13:01.360]  into an explosion it's called silence because you don't notice that it's
[02:13:01.360 --> 02:13:05.280]  sound that's what has happened as we've immersed ourselves in this
[02:13:05.280 --> 02:13:11.600]  electromagnetic soup it's been a it's been a creeping sound of silence that now
[02:13:11.600 --> 02:13:17.520]  when the when we truly have silence and that interference is gone we fully
[02:13:17.520 --> 02:13:21.640]  notice it it's why when we come home from work one of the first things we do
[02:13:21.640 --> 02:13:26.320]  is we kick our shoes off and the reason is we most of us have souls that
[02:13:26.320 --> 02:13:30.360]  actually insulated from the electrical currents within the ground and there are
[02:13:30.360 --> 02:13:35.840]  currents within the ground that our body will in fact does in fact rely on the
[02:13:35.840 --> 02:13:40.120]  natural rhythm of this planet is seven point eight three hurt called Schumann's
[02:13:40.120 --> 02:13:45.160]  resident well that's why that's how birds can navigate right but in Schumann's
[02:13:45.160 --> 02:13:49.800]  resident that's the ideal state if your brain is between seven and eight hurt
[02:13:49.800 --> 02:13:55.880]  you're in this super creative space that is quite remarkable if you can stay
[02:13:55.880 --> 02:13:59.960]  there and that's the natural rhythm of the planet and where we should be instead
[02:13:59.960 --> 02:14:05.000]  we're at 60 cycles in the u.s. or pulses per second the pulsation of our power
[02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:10.040]  grid as our primary sort of interference plays but then we have on top of that
[02:14:10.040 --> 02:14:16.320]  now Wi-Fi wireless of various bandwidths being pulse modulated creating
[02:14:16.320 --> 02:14:22.040]  other secondary effects this is where that sense of stress that explodes
[02:14:22.040 --> 02:14:26.920]  irrationally from time to time maybe it does explain what happened to Charlie
[02:14:26.920 --> 02:14:31.600]  you know the fact is it's happening more frequently with more people in our
[02:14:31.600 --> 02:14:36.200]  solution is Medicaid of dumb them down and numb them down that is not the right
[02:14:36.200 --> 02:14:40.800]  solution the solution is how do we learn how to modulate our own brain activity
[02:14:40.800 --> 02:14:44.760]  and there are ways to do this to learn how to do it so you're not at the whims
[02:14:44.760 --> 02:14:50.080]  of every everything that influences you and quite frankly what used to take
[02:14:50.080 --> 02:14:55.120]  years to perfect now technology offers opportunities to learn how to find that
[02:14:55.120 --> 02:15:00.520]  space and do it consciously with your own effort and basically gain control of
[02:15:00.520 --> 02:15:04.520]  your own mind something that we don't think much about we have spots for the
[02:15:04.520 --> 02:15:08.800]  body we have gyms for the body but what do we have for the mind there are good
[02:15:08.800 --> 02:15:13.600]  technologies out there that will stretch the mind that will cause it to change
[02:15:13.600 --> 02:15:19.600]  its capacity by recognizing what it can do by working with it and that's the
[02:15:19.600 --> 02:15:23.680]  difference well you know one thing I've noticed elites truly rich billionaires
[02:15:23.680 --> 02:15:31.480]  are all moving to extremely rural areas and when you talk to them they basically
[02:15:31.480 --> 02:15:35.240]  wink wink and say we're getting away from all the stuff happening in the city
[02:15:35.240 --> 02:15:41.320]  all the pollution all the cell phones and I mean they certainly know what's
[02:15:41.320 --> 02:15:46.000]  going on yeah you know I have a remote place my mind takes two days to walk in
[02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:50.480]  over land you know there's no trails or roads or anything and in mines for other
[02:15:50.480 --> 02:15:54.240]  reason I got a mining property say hundred acres with some partners but you
[02:15:54.240 --> 02:15:58.160]  know when you go out there I'm in a valley that's closed off I do get a
[02:15:58.160 --> 02:16:02.880]  cell phone signal believe it not some places which totally blows me away
[02:16:02.880 --> 02:16:07.160]  because I mean I'm in the most remote spot on the planet but other than that
[02:16:07.160 --> 02:16:12.760]  there is no power grid for at least 30 miles away from me and you know it's a
[02:16:12.760 --> 02:16:17.680]  pretty nice feeling when you can go out in those places and I encourage people
[02:16:17.680 --> 02:16:22.480]  to do it just to get to shake it off a little bit and get your head cleared and
[02:16:22.480 --> 02:16:27.720]  start thinking forward again and looking for those ways the simple ways to gain
[02:16:27.720 --> 02:16:33.320]  a little bit more control and shake the stress off well Dr. baggage for me and
[02:16:33.320 --> 02:16:36.360]  then we're gonna let you go and I appreciate the time the biggest thing
[02:16:36.360 --> 02:16:40.920]  people could start with is stop watching television that's where the most
[02:16:40.920 --> 02:16:45.040]  programming is that's where it's designed that's where the the not just the
[02:16:45.040 --> 02:16:50.360]  frequency but also the messages that the frequency is bound up with if you'll
[02:16:50.360 --> 02:16:54.600]  just turn the TV off and you'll just stop it you know still go to the movies
[02:16:54.600 --> 02:16:57.920]  or whatever if you want but just stop watching the TV you'll see a difference
[02:16:57.920 --> 02:17:02.720]  in your children your wife your husband everything our culture no one can deny
[02:17:02.720 --> 02:17:07.520]  it is going down the tubes because we're in the death rows of being held by

[02:24:25.440 --> 02:24:30.720]  understand that they've run the same scams over and over again
[02:24:30.720 --> 02:24:34.400]  in first world second world developing and
[02:24:34.400 --> 02:24:39.920]  undeveloped nations third world nations and so they really had time to tweak it
[02:24:39.920 --> 02:24:44.720]  and none of this is my opinion we have IMF World Bank documents we have the
[02:24:44.720 --> 02:24:47.520]  thousands of pages that got leaked in 2002
[02:24:47.520 --> 02:24:50.720]  where they talk about how they get countries in debt knowing they can never
[02:24:50.720 --> 02:24:53.440]  pay it back and then blow out their economy and then
[02:24:53.440 --> 02:24:56.720]  order the government to sell off all their infrastructure to them
[02:24:56.720 --> 02:25:00.160]  for pennies on the dollar and then the banks go in and make sure that
[02:25:00.160 --> 02:25:04.320]  they can never rebuild any infrastructure the name of the game
[02:25:04.320 --> 02:25:08.960]  is control there's so much wealth so much ingenuity
[02:25:08.960 --> 02:25:11.760]  that every country should be a shining jewel
[02:25:11.760 --> 02:25:15.680]  with everybody basically living in mansions
[02:25:15.680 --> 02:25:19.440]  the name of the game is stopping that okay
[02:25:19.440 --> 02:25:23.520]  and creating artificial scarcity I got Aaron Dykes coming in here because he
[02:25:23.520 --> 02:25:31.040]  heard me with Lord Moncton earlier today talking about the head of the
[02:25:31.040 --> 02:25:34.240]  British power system saying we're going to start cutting
[02:25:34.240 --> 02:25:36.800]  your power off you'll not have power a lot of the time
[02:25:36.800 --> 02:25:43.680]  it's for the earth uh venezuela could supply power 24 hours a day it's a
[02:25:43.680 --> 02:25:47.280]  tool of control in chelcescu and romania could
[02:25:47.280 --> 02:25:51.360]  north korea could they made the decision
[02:25:51.360 --> 02:25:56.720]  that you don't get the power and you're thankful when you get it
[02:25:56.720 --> 02:26:01.920]  this is the mark of third world them this is a post-industrial world
[02:26:01.920 --> 02:26:07.600]  the head of the british power authority says they're doing it on purpose
[02:26:07.600 --> 02:26:13.200]  i read to you out of the london telegraph earlier he it's him saying it
[02:26:13.200 --> 02:26:16.560]  and erin's like when you made that video a month ago about obama called
[02:26:16.560 --> 02:26:20.400]  causing the power outages i saw the documents but i didn't really get it
[02:26:20.400 --> 02:26:24.400]  he was like laughing he was like i just watched in ron the smartest guys in
[02:26:24.400 --> 02:26:27.680]  the room you know made six seven years ago and it's got ken lay
[02:26:27.680 --> 02:26:30.640]  admitting that they shut down power plants on purpose
[02:26:30.640 --> 02:26:34.480]  to jack up prices in california and that he wrote the carbon tax plan
[02:26:34.480 --> 02:26:38.240]  as part of the agenda 21 biological diversity assessment
[02:26:38.240 --> 02:26:42.080]  and sustainable development and so erin's and they're printing off all
[02:26:42.080 --> 02:26:47.920]  their statements yes yes yes it's all premeditated it's all
[02:26:47.920 --> 02:26:50.880]  public it has nothing to do with the earth it's about
[02:26:50.880 --> 02:26:54.880]  there being a fraction of the power plants left owned by them
[02:26:54.880 --> 02:26:59.680]  and you'll pay for an hour of power what you paid previously for 24 hours and
[02:26:59.680 --> 02:27:03.040]  you'll thank them but all the government facilities
[02:27:03.040 --> 02:27:07.360]  and all the cop shops they're all going to have power you know terry town
[02:27:07.360 --> 02:27:11.840]  and downtown austin and the police departments here in austin they were
[02:27:11.840 --> 02:27:16.480]  all exempt from the rolling blackouts the rich wealthy liberal trendy area
[02:27:16.480 --> 02:27:21.200]  they're exempt i'm not exempt or i live
[02:27:21.680 --> 02:27:29.360]  they stole more than 20 000 acres in one initiative back in the late 1990s
[02:27:29.360 --> 02:27:32.240]  called save our springs and they said we're going to take all these ranchers
[02:27:32.240 --> 02:27:35.680]  and farmers property uh in southwest austin
[02:27:35.680 --> 02:27:39.280]  so and for a decade before that they wouldn't let them build with city
[02:27:39.280 --> 02:27:43.120]  zoning or sell it but kept their property taxes up
[02:27:43.120 --> 02:27:47.040]  and so then they came and said we're going to have a giant 15 000 acre park
[02:27:47.040 --> 02:27:50.560]  thousand acre park and these other parts it was around 20 000 acres
[02:27:50.560 --> 02:27:54.960]  and they said we're going to pay for about five cents on the dollar
[02:27:54.960 --> 02:27:58.240]  basically forced with adverse possession these farmers ranchers and
[02:27:58.240 --> 02:28:02.480]  developers to sell and they gave it all uh over into the city
[02:28:02.480 --> 02:28:06.720]  consortium the mayor left opened his own land bank
[02:28:06.720 --> 02:28:10.560]  now he's a state senator and they control the land and it's nothing but
[02:28:10.560 --> 02:28:15.360]  five million dollar houses on it and luxury hotels and salons and high
[02:28:15.360 --> 02:28:17.520]  rises and they just built the whole thing up
[02:28:17.520 --> 02:28:24.160]  and they just go we have cops with machine guns there's nothing you can do
[02:28:24.160 --> 02:28:29.120]  now somebody like

[02:35:04.240 --> 02:35:08.160]  look it's so simple but it's also so complex because they know how humans
[02:35:08.160 --> 02:35:12.000]  operate the social engineers the economy's falling apart
[02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:16.240]  they're lying telling us it's getting better government employees are out of
[02:35:16.240 --> 02:35:19.360]  control in many cases they are spoiled in many cases
[02:35:19.360 --> 02:35:24.320]  the unions are corrupt in many cases the middle class is tired of being over
[02:35:24.320 --> 02:35:29.760]  taxed they're sick of being squeezed by the government for more money
[02:35:29.760 --> 02:35:33.680]  they see the incredibly arrogant statements of the union people
[02:35:33.680 --> 02:35:37.760]  and they say shut them down take everything they got
[02:35:37.760 --> 02:35:42.880]  cut their pay cut their health care and that is what's happening here
[02:35:42.880 --> 02:35:49.520]  and michael more comes out and says hey
[02:35:49.520 --> 02:35:53.360]  and we don't have time to play his whole speech it's up on info wars.com
[02:35:53.360 --> 02:35:57.120]  the headline from curtain memo is michael more's communist rhetoric
[02:35:57.120 --> 02:36:01.840]  distracts from larger issue of banksters criminal activity
[02:36:01.840 --> 02:36:05.280]  and it's got his whole speech from yesterday up there and it's got other
[02:36:05.280 --> 02:36:08.240]  bizarre statements by people at the at the rallies
[02:36:08.240 --> 02:36:10.960]  you know saying hey you don't have a right to your own money
[02:36:10.960 --> 02:36:14.400]  that means you don't have a right to your own body and that's what's so evil
[02:36:14.400 --> 02:36:19.200]  about collectivism once you have it there's an army of people that think
[02:36:19.200 --> 02:36:24.000]  that they are owed more and more and more of what you got
[02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:29.440]  and it doesn't matter if 80 plus percent of the money that's been stolen from
[02:36:29.440 --> 02:36:32.720]  you went offshore
[02:36:32.720 --> 02:36:35.840]  the big hordes of union people they're being told
[02:36:35.840 --> 02:36:39.600]  hey you want your job you want more money you want to keep your paycheck
[02:36:39.600 --> 02:36:43.360]  get it out of the private free market people's pocket
[02:36:43.360 --> 02:36:47.840]  and so you've got the big global banking cartel that owns the military
[02:36:47.840 --> 02:36:51.680]  industrial complex and that owns our dominant mainstream
[02:36:51.680 --> 02:36:55.280]  media and that manipulates the controls
[02:36:55.280 --> 02:37:01.360]  all these big teamsters unions and the rest of them
[02:37:01.360 --> 02:37:04.560]  and it's really very simple what's happening it's divide and conquer you
[02:37:04.560 --> 02:37:07.680]  got the globalist on top you got the unions on the bottom the unions
[02:37:07.680 --> 02:37:11.040]  meanwhile that is their average members do and it's too
[02:37:11.040 --> 02:37:14.480]  sophisticated for them to be able to understand
[02:37:14.480 --> 02:37:19.680]  even what's happening they don't even understand what's happening
[02:37:19.680 --> 02:37:23.200]  but it's very simple what the banksters do in third world country after third
[02:37:23.200 --> 02:37:25.120]  world country and now in first world country
[02:37:25.120 --> 02:37:28.560]  after first world country is the banksters
[02:37:28.560 --> 02:37:31.920]  get the governments to basically buy into the derivatives
[02:37:31.920 --> 02:37:36.000]  failure of the bankers the bankers use the derivatives on the way up to buy up
[02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:40.160]  the planet and the resources and then to put themselves into commodities and
[02:37:40.160 --> 02:37:43.520]  things that are safer they leave the bad investments
[02:37:43.520 --> 02:37:47.040]  with the government pension funds the private pension funds
[02:37:47.040 --> 02:37:54.240]  and other pension funds of smaller companies they don't control
[02:37:54.240 --> 02:37:57.040]  then as the economy starts to go into freefall
[02:37:57.040 --> 02:37:59.760]  they say we've got to have cuts to government
[02:37:59.760 --> 02:38:03.200]  we've got to balance the budget
[02:38:04.160 --> 02:38:09.280]  but then they never discuss the record multi hundred billion dollar bonuses
[02:38:09.280 --> 02:38:12.320]  being paid out for Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan
[02:38:12.320 --> 02:38:20.080]  and Wells Fargo and Smith Barney and all the rest of the insiders
[02:38:20.080 --> 02:38:23.520]  they're getting fatter they're making the biggest profits ever
[02:38:23.520 --> 02:38:28.400]  they engineered the end of Glass-Steagall they sold to government
[02:38:28.400 --> 02:38:31.360]  and your pension funds these failed derivatives
[02:38:31.360 --> 02:38:34.240]  and now they're holding us hostage saying you've got to keep giving us more
[02:38:34.240 --> 02:38:36.560]  money now i watched this whole 30-something minute
[02:38:36.560 --> 02:38:39.840]  speech it's up on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com
[02:38:39.840 --> 02:38:44.080]  and did Michael Moore the guy who makes money off Haliburton and big defense
[02:38:44.080 --> 02:38:47.520]  contractors consciously while bad mouthing wars
[02:38:47.520 --> 02:38:53.440]  the guy who tries to do his films in areas where he can get around unions
[02:38:53.440 --> 02:38:56.640]  the guy that goes along with the official story of 9-11
[02:38:56.640 --> 02:39:00.000]  the guy that tried to have his bodyguards basically rough me up so i
[02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:03.520]  couldn't ask him questions a hypocrite who made his whole life
[02:39:03.520 --> 02:39:07.520]  about going up and confronting media people and government people
[02:39:07.520 --> 02:39:10.640]  and and putting them down if their bodyguards even touched him while his
[02:39:10.640 --> 02:39:14.160]  bodyguards were ramming their arms into my stomach you know what i did
[02:39:14.160 --> 02:39:17.440]  i just punched him right back it's on video oh you think you're a big tough
[02:39:17.440 --> 02:39:21.280]  guy buddy you just rammed into me how do you like that now hit me in the face
[02:39:21.280 --> 02:39:25.040]  and see what happens punk i'm sorry the point is is that
[02:39:25.040 --> 02:39:29.600]  is that is that that guy is a hypocrite
[02:39:30.960 --> 02:39:35.200]  he's a big fat bully and i'm sick of him he's out there like a pipe piper
[02:39:35.200 --> 02:39:37.840]  manipulating all those well-meaning union people
[02:39:37.840 --> 02:39:42.000]  those low-level union people have their dues stolen by the corrupt fat cat
[02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:45.280]  unions that are out there beating up tea partyers everywhere
[02:39:45.280 --> 02:39:48.720]  and the tea partyers are being conned as well but it's very simple
[02:39:48.720 --> 02:39:52.640]  michael morgue goes there's 400 people who have
[02:39:52.640 --> 02:39:56.720]  more wealth than half the population of america
[02:39:56.720 --> 02:40:00.880]  and that's true that's a true number and almost all of them are hedge fund
[02:40:00.880 --> 02:40:05.120]  managers people that created trillions of dollars a piece
[02:40:05.120 --> 02:40:08.480]  in fake baloney and then made the money off the top of it
[02:40:08.480 --> 02:40:12.160]  i mean i've seen hedge fund managers are making six seven eight nine billion a
[02:40:12.160 --> 02:40:14.800]  year
[02:40:14.800 --> 02:40:18.080]  they set grease up not even owning the money to them getting them to buy into
[02:40:18.080 --> 02:40:20.240]  derivatives where it's like oh you owe me six
[02:40:20.240 --> 02:40:23.200]  billion at one hedge fund manager i want this island
[02:40:23.200 --> 02:40:26.880]  they're like okay here's the island he writes off the debt
[02:40:26.880 --> 02:40:31.760]  whoa whoa but you don't say you're going after them because
[02:40:31.760 --> 02:40:36.560]  of the free market is bad it's not the free market to have banker insiders
[02:40:36.560 --> 02:40:42.880]  buying off the government and having them set up insider sweetheart deals
[02:40:42.880 --> 02:40:46.720]  where you
[02:40:46.720 --> 02:40:50.240]  get to create all this counterfeit money and then
[02:40:50.240 --> 02:40:52.640]  not getting trouble for it instead get more power
[02:40:52.640 --> 02:40:56.480]  so see he's there saying the wealth of these 400 people
[02:40:56.480 --> 02:41:01.440]  is a national resource and that you don't own that money that's not your
[02:41:01.440 --> 02:41:04.560]  money folks here's the issue those crowds don't understand
[02:41:04.560 --> 02:41:07.440]  that those 400 people some of them actually made it through owning
[02:41:07.440 --> 02:41:10.640]  restaurant chains or car dealerships or sports teams but
[02:41:10.640 --> 02:41:14.320]  up to 400 and if you look at the list of the top cream it's mainly bankers
[02:41:14.320 --> 02:41:18.720]  engaged in fraud not your corner bank the big mega banks
[02:41:18.720 --> 02:41:21.840]  and most of its offshore to begin with they're not going to have any of their
[02:41:21.840 --> 02:41:25.520]  wealth taken they are going to use that big horde of half the
[02:41:25.520 --> 02:41:29.760]  population either on welfare or working for a union or the defense
[02:41:29.760 --> 02:41:32.240]  contractors that are there fighting with them
[02:41:32.240 --> 02:41:36.160]  talking about how they're on welfare you're on warfare
[02:41:36.160 --> 02:41:40.160]  that eisenhower talked about i mean get real more than half the world's defense
[02:41:40.160 --> 02:41:44.960]  budgets is the us all the other countries can't
[02:41:44.960 --> 02:41:47.920]  even add up so you gotta love the irony of that the guy
[02:41:47.920 --> 02:41:50.720]  they're saying doesn't have a right to protest the guy you know the guy they
[02:41:50.720 --> 02:41:54.800]  tell hey i have a right to your money you don't have a right to your money
[02:41:54.800 --> 02:41:59.120]  he he's a defense contractor and i'm not saying you're inherently
[02:41:59.120 --> 02:42:02.160]  evil if you're an engineer and that's what you do that's the only job anyways
[02:42:02.160 --> 02:42:05.600]  for you the point is buddy you're living off my tax money too
[02:42:05.600 --> 02:42:12.000]  and i'm sick of it i'm sick of all of you now the banksters are getting upwards
[02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:15.840]  of 80 percent of all the money the welfare moms the union people
[02:42:15.840 --> 02:42:19.760]  they're getting around 20 percent of it my point is your rearranging chairs on
[02:42:19.760 --> 02:42:23.680]  the titanic deck having all of us fight with each
[02:42:23.680 --> 02:42:27.760]  other out there and there's the globalist move having their judas goat
[02:42:27.760 --> 02:42:32.080]  their deceiver up there with with stuff written a third grade level
[02:42:32.080 --> 02:42:36.160]  talking to them about it's not their money it's your money
[02:42:36.160 --> 02:42:42.240]  yay because it's not going to be the 400 people who have as much wealth as 50
[02:42:42.240 --> 02:42:46.240]  percent of the country it's going to be those 400 people
[02:42:46.240 --> 02:42:52.800]  robbing the other 49.9 percent so he didn't say those 400 have more
[02:42:52.800 --> 02:42:56.320]  than all the country he said 50 percent yeah 50 percent
[02:42:56.320 --> 02:42:59.840]  who on average are making about 30 thousand dollars a year less
[02:42:59.840 --> 02:43:04.000]  no no the target is the people making 100 thousand 300 thousand a million a year
[02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:07.600]  they got the boat slips they go to your restaurants they buy the clothes
[02:43:07.600 --> 02:43:11.120]  they make the economy go folks and the globalists are targeting them
[02:43:11.120 --> 02:43:14.640]  because once they knock them out it's over and the middle class is disappearing
[02:43:14.640 --> 02:43:18.160]  right now that's the fat buffalo that the general public
[02:43:18.160 --> 02:43:22.480]  feeds off of the fat buffalo is is dying the globalists are just cutting out
[02:43:22.480 --> 02:43:25.440]  their tongues that's all they're doing for
[02:43:25.440 --> 02:43:30.080]  buffalo tongue sandwich they're wiping them out right now
[02:43:30.080 --> 02:43:35.360]  just like the globalists wiped out the buffalo to make the plains indians die
[02:43:35.360 --> 02:43:39.760]  scorched earth policy the globalists are wiping out the middle class they always
[02:43:39.760 --> 02:43:43.120]  do it it's in their handbooks i want to play this quick clip
[02:43:43.120 --> 02:43:46.320]  here is and it's up on info words we want to see the full thing
[02:43:46.320 --> 02:43:50.960]  of of the union people with their big union signs saying you don't have a
[02:43:50.960 --> 02:43:53.840]  right to your own money i mean this
[02:43:53.840 --> 02:43:56.800]  this is incredible that this type of stuff
[02:43:56.800 --> 02:44:01.520]  is going on here it is and bring you to my side there's a difference
[02:44:01.520 --> 02:44:04.800]  i'm not trying to beat you up i'm not trying to just show you that i hate you
[02:44:04.800 --> 02:44:07.840]  and that i'm just an arrogant bastard well i don't hate you and i'm not
[02:44:07.840 --> 02:44:10.880]  feeding you up right now it's everybody actually your only your only
[02:44:10.880 --> 02:44:14.720]  stated goal is that i go away don't i want you to go away
[02:44:14.720 --> 02:44:20.800]  from these people who are half rights and what i'm saying is that their rights
[02:44:20.800 --> 02:44:24.160]  are enshrined on mud rights and i'd like them to stop that
[02:44:24.160 --> 02:44:27.920]  every dollar yeah i have to pay in time why do you have a right to your money
[02:44:27.920 --> 02:44:32.000]  because the point is because i heard it because i spent the time
[02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:36.800]  and we just did and so did i except for you were earning your money
[02:44:36.800 --> 02:44:40.000]  all right i don't have time to play at all then they have a debate about how
[02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:42.960]  he doesn't ever write to his own money and like a bunch of
[02:44:42.960 --> 02:44:47.840]  lobotomized chickens hopping around the mindless union people go i'll get your
[02:44:47.840 --> 02:44:51.120]  money your money mine mine mine mine
[02:44:51.120 --> 02:44:54.080]  and then the big defense contractor slides over
[02:44:54.080 --> 02:44:56.640]  who does look like he's actually intelligent he goes well i built
[02:44:56.640 --> 02:45:00.000]  something that's needed i make more money i'm a defense contractor
[02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:04.240]  you still live off my money pal get your hand out of my pocket
[02:45:04.240 --> 02:45:07.600]  oh but america's good the defense contractors are good yeah
[02:45:07.600 --> 02:45:11.200]  the whole pentagon system trying to take our guns what always overthrows
[02:45:11.200 --> 02:45:15.520]  countries its own military wake up pal all of you make me sick
[02:45:15.520 --> 02:45:19.200]  and in that clip everything's illustrated they're all on government payroll
[02:45:19.200 --> 02:45:23.040]  even the private sector ones the union slugs the
[02:45:23.040 --> 02:45:26.560]  defense contractor slug who's a total hypocrite
[02:45:26.560 --> 02:45:31.920]  you're a total sickening hypocrite you're probably making 100,000 200,000 a year
[02:45:31.920 --> 02:45:35.280]  you got some union guy making 30,000 a year he wants to keep his benefits and
[02:45:35.280 --> 02:45:39.280]  you're self-righteously in his face sure he's a mindless lobotomized
[02:45:39.280 --> 02:45:42.560]  fluoride head who probably can't even tie his shoelaces
[02:45:42.560 --> 02:45:46.800]  he's so so dumb he thinks you don't have a right to your own money
[02:45:46.800 --> 02:45:50.000]  you do have a right to your money if you earned it in the free market pal
[02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:55.120]  not out of my pocket with tax money so who's more guilty
[02:45:55.120 --> 02:45:59.760]  but it's exactly what michael moore's doing do you understand it
[02:45:59.760 --> 02:46:02.720]  he works for the banksters sickening this giant
[02:46:02.720 --> 02:46:06.640]  horde of people that are about to have their jobs cut or lose their jobs or
[02:46:06.640 --> 02:46:09.680]  have their pay cut they're out there chanting it's our money
[02:46:09.680 --> 02:46:13.920]  take the middle class's money they're rich and they're going to come destroy
[02:46:13.920 --> 02:46:17.760]  what's left of the middle class this is what happens when you have a
[02:46:17.760 --> 02:46:21.520]  giant domesticated mob on government payroll when you have a
[02:46:21.520 --> 02:46:26.720]  democracy that michael slug moore calls for
[02:46:26.720 --> 02:46:31.360]  51 vote to take your property and then when things break down under communist
[02:46:31.360 --> 02:46:35.200]  system the commas are then put you in forced labor
[02:46:35.200 --> 02:46:39.120]  because you're lazy you need to now work for the greater state
[02:46:39.120 --> 02:46:43.200]  now i'm going to talk more about this tomorrow i
[02:46:43.200 --> 02:46:47.600]  i got running late but something that dovetails uh with all of this
[02:46:47.600 --> 02:46:53.600]  here look it's simple it's not the governor good the union's bad no it's
[02:46:53.600 --> 02:46:56.720]  unions controlled and bad governor controlled and bad
[02:46:56.720 --> 02:47:00.320]  getting us to end fight down here instead of talking about the 1.5
[02:47:00.320 --> 02:47:04.400]  quadrillion derivatives the black hole it's impossible to pay off
[02:47:04.400 --> 02:47:08.080]  all we're doing is cutting now the welfare state which is terrible and
[02:47:08.080 --> 02:47:11.840]  domesticates us so that whatever's left of that can be paid to the bankers
[02:47:11.840 --> 02:47:15.520]  and so they can rile up the welfare state into a political mobilized army
[02:47:15.520 --> 02:47:18.960]  to come rob the rest of us and then the welfare state will get a paltry sum of
[02:47:18.960 --> 02:47:21.760]  it the rest we transfer to the bankers the bankers are just getting their
[02:47:21.760 --> 02:47:24.720]  hoard ready when the military industrial complex
[02:47:24.720 --> 02:47:28.560]  doesn't get their welfare they blow up buildings in manhattan
[02:47:28.560 --> 02:47:33.440]  the unions just go out and start protesting you understand that when the
[02:47:33.440 --> 02:47:36.400]  military industrial complex wants to take over america they bomb oklahoma
[02:47:36.400 --> 02:47:40.160]  city when they want to take over the world they blow up the world trade center
[02:47:40.160 --> 02:47:43.680]  i'm sick of all of you and all your welfare ruin in this country
[02:47:43.680 --> 02:47:46.400]  all right now for the rest of this segment the next
[02:47:46.400 --> 02:47:49.680]  erin dox came to me and he said you know you made that video
[02:47:49.680 --> 02:47:52.560]  and i didn't i understood it but i didn't quite get it about
[02:47:52.560 --> 02:47:56.080]  they're shutting down the power plants so that so that select companies
[02:47:56.080 --> 02:47:59.600]  make the money but then today with lord montan he really got it and he printed
[02:47:59.600 --> 02:48:02.960]  off a bunch of documents from his deep research because sometimes you can't see
[02:48:02.960 --> 02:48:06.800]  the forest for the trees erin break down your synopsis
[02:48:06.800 --> 02:48:10.080]  uh... yeah and additionally i was watching the documentary enron the
[02:48:10.080 --> 02:48:13.120]  smartest guys in the room it's been out since 2005
[02:48:13.120 --> 02:48:16.480]  uh... before those guys went on trial but if you set aside
[02:48:16.480 --> 02:48:20.480]  the whole larger pump a dump scheme that they did one of the main things
[02:48:20.480 --> 02:48:24.000]  enron did was use california's deregulation
[02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:29.520]  to instill rolling blackouts so they could completely monopolize and profit
[02:48:29.520 --> 02:48:33.600]  from it and they got on record to teach people about artificial scarcity
[02:48:33.600 --> 02:48:36.960]  oh there's not must not be enough power i better pay more they'd rather sell you
[02:48:36.960 --> 02:48:39.680]  one hour than 24 hours at a higher price
[02:48:39.680 --> 02:48:43.040]  and they were never out of power they just manipulated it it's admitted
[02:48:43.040 --> 02:48:46.080]  they used the traders and marketers to drive up the system
[02:48:46.080 --> 02:48:51.280]  going from about 12 billion in power in the first quarter of 2000 to 48 billion
[02:48:51.280 --> 02:48:55.760]  in the first quarter of 2001 that's on wikipedia that's just one of the basic
[02:48:55.760 --> 02:49:00.800]  introduction sources but the point is ken laye and these other enron and
[02:49:00.800 --> 02:49:04.800]  bankers and goldman sacks types were not just involved in their own company
[02:49:04.800 --> 02:49:08.240]  schemes they helped set up the cap and trade system
[02:49:08.240 --> 02:49:12.320]  which has a complete they're on record this is not a conspiracy theory with
[02:49:12.320 --> 02:49:15.600]  al gore saying we're going to claim environmentalism we're going to shut
[02:49:15.600 --> 02:49:18.240]  down all our competition to make a hundred times the profit
[02:49:18.240 --> 02:49:21.120]  and i have that clip maybe we could play when we come back from break
[02:49:21.120 --> 02:49:26.320]  but ken laye was on the presidential council for sustainable development
[02:49:26.320 --> 02:49:29.920]  agenda 21 under the clinton administration in 93
[02:49:29.920 --> 02:49:33.920]  with a bunch of other familiar players setting up you know the cap and trade
[02:49:33.920 --> 02:49:38.320]  system we know today to instill rolling blackouts as we saw in texas
[02:49:38.320 --> 02:49:41.600]  and they're doing the same thing in in england and other places
[02:49:41.600 --> 02:49:45.840]  it's very similar to the way they use the deregulation in california
[02:49:45.840 --> 02:49:50.480]  back in the early 2000s to make massive profits off of rolling blackouts you
[02:49:50.480 --> 02:49:53.520]  understand what i'm saying no it was all came out in court and was confirmed they
[02:49:53.520 --> 02:49:56.960]  had fake energy trading systems they would show members of congress in the
[02:49:56.960 --> 02:50:02.080]  california legislature and it's all about reducing power shutting down all
[02:50:02.080 --> 02:50:04.960]  their competition and the the clips they have in the
[02:50:04.960 --> 02:50:07.520]  movie enron smartest guys in the room are amazing
[02:50:07.520 --> 02:50:10.560]  because they have now declassified or leaked through
[02:50:10.560 --> 02:50:16.240]  court or whatever uh audio transcripts and actual tapes of these traders uh
[02:50:16.240 --> 02:50:19.360]  saying you know the profits aren't high enough today can we come up with an
[02:50:19.360 --> 02:50:23.920]  excuse to shut down these power grids uh you know or they would ship the power
[02:50:23.920 --> 02:50:27.200]  over states when it wasn't conducive in california
[02:50:27.200 --> 02:50:30.240]  and then wait till the prices went back up in california then they would bring
[02:50:30.240 --> 02:50:34.480]  the power back in and the point is they completely regulated
[02:50:34.480 --> 02:50:37.840]  or they completely controlled rather the black the truth is the free market
[02:50:37.840 --> 02:50:42.080]  would make everybody wealthy we see how the insiders are in there always with
[02:50:42.080 --> 02:50:45.600]  crony capitalism then they scapegoat crony
[02:50:45.600 --> 02:50:49.680]  capitalism they scapegoat capitalism with crony capitalism
[02:50:49.680 --> 02:50:53.200]  and then blame capitalism itself and bring in total socialism
[02:50:53.200 --> 02:50:56.720]  to take our wealth transferred to them offshore that's the big secret and
[02:50:56.720 --> 02:50:59.120]  that's what michael moore is doing he's offering
[02:50:59.120 --> 02:51:03.200]  socialism as the solution when it's the problem imagine being free of debt in
[02:51:03.200 --> 02:51:07.280]  just 12 weeks without payment plans or negotiating or hiring an

[02:54:48.160 --> 02:54:51.280]  goldman sacks and i know you've got interest with goldman sacks no these
[02:54:51.280 --> 02:54:55.200]  people well it's that's been reported is that not accurate no i
[02:54:55.200 --> 02:55:02.160]  i wish i did with executives from the your partnered in companies with

[02:55:06.560 --> 02:55:10.400]  uh and look at who the players are today it's the very same people that set
[02:55:10.400 --> 02:55:14.560]  this up in the mid 90s with al gore now running the government program to shut
[02:55:14.560 --> 02:55:18.480]  down all the power plants that they don't own in control and n ron
[02:55:18.480 --> 02:55:22.080]  people went to jail for setting this up and now they're doing the same scam in
[02:55:22.080 --> 02:55:24.560]  england i mean this is nothing to do with the environment
[02:55:24.560 --> 02:55:28.640]  these are crooks they want to use big government just like obama gives out

[02:55:32.640 --> 02:55:36.320]  you don't get the waiver this is this is mafia where only they can do business
