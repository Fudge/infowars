[00:00.000 --> 00:08.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Wednesday, the 8th day of June 2016.
[00:08.960 --> 00:14.120]  We have just seen an incredibly historical event take place with Donald Trump getting
[00:14.120 --> 00:19.040]  more votes than any Republican ever has to completely clinch the nomination.
[00:19.040 --> 00:25.640]  We've also seen the organized criminal with a longer trail of sinister activities that
[00:25.640 --> 00:28.640]  anybody I've ever seen in history get the nomination.
[00:28.640 --> 00:33.240]  Yeah, we've had some bad presidents commit a lot of crimes once they get into office,
[00:33.240 --> 00:38.200]  but this woman is a master criminal and it is another victory for gimmicks.
[00:38.200 --> 00:39.200]  We have the black president.
[00:39.200 --> 00:40.500]  Now it's a woman president.
[00:40.500 --> 00:45.060]  How that black president worked out for African Americans, double unemployment.
[00:45.060 --> 00:49.400]  This is a total screw job, but she's stolen the election clearly from Sanders.
[00:49.400 --> 00:50.680]  We're going to cover it all today.
[00:50.680 --> 00:54.520]  We have a jam-packed transmission, but first, I just tweeted this out.
[00:54.520 --> 00:55.520]  It's so important.
[00:55.520 --> 01:01.000]  This video could bring down Hillary Clinton, John Bount reports on the organized crime
[01:01.000 --> 01:04.120]  syndicate master now in control.
[01:04.120 --> 01:09.120]  Prepare yourself for the main event Hillary Clinton has by most accounts clinched the
[01:09.120 --> 01:14.280]  Democratic presidential nomination, dragging her mountainous pile of scandals into the
[01:14.280 --> 01:19.320]  last round to possibly make her the next president of the United States.
[01:19.320 --> 01:24.720]  Hillary's rise to the White House is akin to Richard Nixon in reverse.
[01:24.720 --> 01:31.280]  This is the same woman who recently gave a speech on income inequality wearing a $12,000
[01:31.280 --> 01:32.640]  Armani jacket.
[01:32.640 --> 01:37.720]  The same woman who, according to a Secret Service account, punched Bill Clinton so hard
[01:37.720 --> 01:39.400]  she gave him a black eye.
[01:39.400 --> 01:44.240]  Granted, Bill probably deserved it, but that is only one clear example of the temperament
[01:44.240 --> 01:50.000]  that could quite possibly have access to 1750 active nuclear warheads.
[01:50.000 --> 01:55.120]  She's got health issues, and they're going back and asking me and others that have known
[01:55.120 --> 01:58.760]  her since the beginning, what is it about Hillary?
[01:58.760 --> 02:02.880]  And Hillary Alex has had a mental issue since day one.
[02:02.880 --> 02:04.560]  She does not like people.
[02:04.560 --> 02:05.560]  She is an animal.
[02:05.560 --> 02:10.520]  She's everything I've told you she is, and it is a mental problem, and that's what's
[02:10.520 --> 02:14.040]  causing her trouble running this election to be quite honest.
[02:14.040 --> 02:16.640]  You can't make her a people person.
[02:16.640 --> 02:18.640]  You just can't do it.
[02:18.640 --> 02:22.320]  So that's where we're at, but there's going to be stories about that.
[02:22.320 --> 02:26.560]  But remember, none of these things are going to hurt Hillary.
[02:26.560 --> 02:27.560]  None.
[02:27.560 --> 02:32.320]  And the Secret Service desperately wants Americans to know that the real Hillary Clinton
[02:32.320 --> 02:33.820]  is a monster.
[02:33.820 --> 02:38.560]  According to Page Six, Secret Service agent Gary Byrne writes in his New Telol book that
[02:38.560 --> 02:43.760]  Hillary repeatedly screamed obscenities at her husband's Secret Service personnel and
[02:43.760 --> 02:48.480]  White House staffers, all of whom lived in terror of her next tirade.
[02:48.480 --> 02:53.560]  Secret Service agents had discussions about the possibility that they would have to protect
[02:53.560 --> 02:59.160]  Bill from his wife's physical attacks, Byrne writes, and the couple had one violent encounter
[02:59.160 --> 03:02.960]  the morning of a key presidential address to the nation.
[03:02.960 --> 03:08.440]  Will Hillary spend the first hundred days of her presidency pardoning herself and permanently
[03:08.440 --> 03:15.280]  silencing her husband's accusers, simultaneously sickening the IRS and the FBI on the Clinton's
[03:15.280 --> 03:16.280]  enemies?
[03:16.280 --> 03:21.160]  There's just a few of the unanswered scandals that will surface yet again when Hillary is
[03:21.160 --> 03:23.960]  president courtesy of WorldNet Daily.
[03:23.960 --> 03:32.520]  Vince Foster's 1993 death, Benghazi, Whitewater, Emailgate, Chinagate, Travelgate, Pardongate,
[03:32.520 --> 03:38.360]  the Clinton body count, where 91% of the Clinton Foundation's money really went.
[03:38.360 --> 03:43.520]  Hillary's assistant Muslim Brotherhood tied Huma Abedin's involvement with the Saudis
[03:43.520 --> 03:48.560]  to establish a Muslim America, and we could be here all day if I just kept on going, but
[03:48.560 --> 03:54.800]  it appears stealing the Democratic presidential nomination as child's play to the career criminal
[03:54.800 --> 03:57.280]  known as Hillary Rodham Clinton.
[03:57.280 --> 04:01.760]  The Clintons even attempted to loot the White House when Bill's term ended.
[04:01.760 --> 04:07.960]  The Clintons tried to take 190,000 from the presidential mansion in furniture and gifts,
[04:07.960 --> 04:12.080]  attempting to have it shipped back to the Clinton's Chappaqua, New York home.
[04:12.080 --> 04:16.080]  But according to the General Accounting Office, the cost of the White House vandalism reached
[04:16.080 --> 04:18.760]  about $14,000.
[04:18.760 --> 04:24.520]  The agency said some of the destruction was intentional, including glue smeared on desks,
[04:24.520 --> 04:30.080]  broken furniture, offices full of trash and graffiti in a men's restroom stall, that
[04:30.080 --> 04:32.240]  disparaged Bush.
[04:32.240 --> 04:35.960]  There were also missing doorknobs, medallions and office signs.
[04:35.960 --> 04:41.080]  Is there any question that Hillary will sign away any remaining sovereignty the United
[04:41.080 --> 04:47.280]  States has left to her globalist overlords, acting as the cleanup crew for Obama's two-term
[04:47.280 --> 04:54.200]  facade of a presidency, carrying on the Bush presidency's unyielding New World Order disintegration
[04:54.200 --> 04:56.280]  of the U.S. Constitution?
[04:56.280 --> 05:12.760]  John Bowne for Infowars.com The Constitutional Convention of 1787 was held strict secrecy,
[05:12.760 --> 05:17.760]  and at the end of the preceding, citizens gathered outside Independence Hall to learn
[05:17.760 --> 05:22.760]  what had been produced behind closed doors.
[05:22.760 --> 05:29.040]  The Republic is not a democracy, where republic operates under the rule of law, which protects
[05:29.040 --> 05:32.200]  individual liberties, so that the majority cannot take the rights of the minority.
[05:32.200 --> 05:36.320]  In the violence, the government and its citizens all abide by the same laws, regardless of
[05:36.320 --> 05:38.060]  political power or lack thereof.
[05:38.060 --> 05:41.800]  The democracy on the other hand, only leads to mob rule, fueled by the unrestrained zooms
[05:41.800 --> 05:42.800]  of the public.
[05:42.800 --> 05:46.520]  In the democracy, the individual or any groups of individuals proposing the minority, have
[05:46.520 --> 05:48.920]  no protection against the unlimited power of the majority.
[05:48.920 --> 05:51.000]  It is a case of majority over man.
[05:51.000 --> 05:54.680]  In other words, under democracy, two wolves can vote to eat the sheep for dinner.
[05:54.680 --> 05:58.120]  But under a republic, a sheep's right to life is protected by the rule of law.
[05:58.120 --> 06:27.960]  This is Kit Daniels with infoworse.com.

[07:01.240 --> 07:05.080]  It's not just our water we need to filter, it's not just our food that needs to be cleaned,
[07:05.080 --> 07:07.960]  it's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[07:07.960 --> 07:13.960]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[07:13.960 --> 07:18.840]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure Groundbreaking
[07:18.840 --> 07:23.160]  Water Filtration Systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[07:23.160 --> 07:27.240]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family,
[07:27.240 --> 07:30.520]  your children, through the best job you can to purify your air.
[07:30.520 --> 07:34.160]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[07:34.160 --> 07:37.680]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more
[07:37.680 --> 07:40.640]  expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[07:40.640 --> 07:44.480]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[07:44.480 --> 07:51.320]  It's normally $220 plus, but right now, for limited time, it's less than $200 at infoworsestore.com.
[07:51.320 --> 07:55.520]  When a small profit be made goes to find our reporters, this is a 360 win.
[07:55.520 --> 08:24.520]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at infoworsestore.com.
[08:26.520 --> 08:35.040]  We have seen unprecedented developments in our constitutional republic that is under siege.
[08:35.040 --> 08:41.960]  Hillary Clinton undoubtedly has stolen the election from Bernie Sanders.
[08:41.960 --> 08:45.720]  I hate Bernie Sanders.
[08:45.720 --> 08:49.600]  I don't just get up here and say that they've stolen it from him because I just want to
[08:49.600 --> 08:50.600]  say that.
[08:50.600 --> 08:51.600]  It's a fact.
[08:51.600 --> 08:52.600]  We're going to go over it today.
[08:52.600 --> 08:59.400]  It was done in plain view, even New York Daily News and other major liberal publications
[08:59.400 --> 09:03.120]  admit that he got more votes across the country than Hillary.
[09:03.120 --> 09:09.120]  And mind you, that's with them stealing elections day one in places like New Hampshire where
[09:09.120 --> 09:17.200]  he would win by 20 points but get less delegates than Hillary.
[09:17.200 --> 09:19.520]  So that creates the perception, oh, don't vote for him.
[09:19.520 --> 09:20.520]  He can't win.
[09:20.520 --> 09:22.840]  That's what they hope to do, stealing it early.
[09:22.840 --> 09:23.840]  People didn't care.
[09:23.840 --> 09:27.840]  They still went for Bernie Sanders because they hate Hillary so much.
[09:27.840 --> 09:31.520]  And I've bashed Bernie supporters until I've gone out in public and seen people wearing
[09:31.520 --> 09:34.280]  Bernie shirts.
[09:34.280 --> 09:36.960]  And most of them are listeners and they're like, listen, we went all out at the Fed.
[09:36.960 --> 09:37.960]  We like you.
[09:37.960 --> 09:38.960]  We like Ron Paul.
[09:38.960 --> 09:42.680]  You know, we know he's pretty extreme on socialism, but we think he's anti-establishment,
[09:42.680 --> 09:43.680]  which he clearly is.
[09:43.680 --> 09:45.400]  They're going after him.
[09:45.400 --> 09:50.840]  And so I've got to give it to Bernie Sanders, it's hard to say that.
[09:50.840 --> 09:55.080]  It is hard to say that for not giving up last night and saying he's going to keep going
[09:55.080 --> 09:56.080]  forward.
[09:56.080 --> 10:00.560]  Now he's saying he's going to keep fighting to have power at the convention for the platform.
[10:00.560 --> 10:05.920]  Nobody, you need to come out and take the gloves off and say, I won New Hampshire.
[10:05.920 --> 10:07.960]  I won the over 10 states.
[10:07.960 --> 10:17.000]  They admit that he won where the super delegates met in secret and then decided who the delegates
[10:17.000 --> 10:18.000]  voted for.
[10:18.000 --> 10:20.440]  And by the way, in California, Leon McAdoo was there for two days.
[10:20.440 --> 10:21.440]  She's still there today.
[10:21.440 --> 10:27.120]  80% or more of the people, she's putting together a report on it of just hundreds of interviews.
[10:27.120 --> 10:32.560]  Exit polls, you name it, said, no, I'm voting for Bernie Sanders.
[10:32.560 --> 10:35.720]  In fact, for a day, she couldn't find anybody on the street that was for Hillary.
[10:35.720 --> 10:43.920]  She had to go to polling places to find some and to Hillary rallies with bigs to find them.
[10:43.920 --> 10:45.800]  They were all there last night for the Hillary rally.
[10:45.800 --> 10:46.800]  All of it.
[10:46.800 --> 10:47.800]  They're going to be on air with us today.
[10:47.800 --> 10:51.120]  A huge broadcast, but wow, wow.
[10:51.120 --> 10:56.000]  I mean, forget Hillary, forget Sanders, forget Trump, okay?
[10:56.000 --> 10:57.000]  Forget all that.
[10:57.000 --> 11:02.880]  We're at a point where they are now implementing rules that they never implemented to say your
[11:02.880 --> 11:04.320]  vote doesn't count.
[11:04.320 --> 11:08.120]  Now the good news is when the Republicans tried it with Donald Trump with a confidence
[11:08.120 --> 11:11.360]  game going, of course, your vote never counted.
[11:11.360 --> 11:12.360]  It blew up in their face.
[11:12.360 --> 11:15.200]  They had to back off with the force feeding.
[11:15.200 --> 11:20.000]  They tried to engage in a case that can cruise and the rest of it with Democrats, though,
[11:20.000 --> 11:21.000]  it remains to be seen.
[11:21.000 --> 11:25.000]  They're saying the AP is warning its reporters of violent Bernie supporters.
[11:25.000 --> 11:29.400]  The police are bracing in Philadelphia for the crisis of the Bernie supporters.
[11:29.400 --> 11:31.600]  Everyone is scared of the Bernie supporters.
[11:31.600 --> 11:32.600]  They're coming.
[11:32.600 --> 11:33.600]  They're so evil.
[11:33.600 --> 11:35.520]  Now, they have attacked our reporters.
[11:35.520 --> 11:37.200]  They have beat people up.
[11:37.200 --> 11:38.760]  So have Hillary supporters.
[11:38.760 --> 11:39.760]  They are socialists.
[11:39.760 --> 11:40.760]  They are stupid.
[11:40.760 --> 11:44.120]  They think they're getting something for free, many of them.
[11:44.120 --> 11:47.040]  Those that aren't just protest voting, they're angry.
[11:47.040 --> 11:50.600]  Like you're robbing something from them because you're not going to put Bernie in and you're
[11:50.600 --> 11:54.240]  going to keep them from their free ride, their free lunch.
[11:54.240 --> 11:59.560]  But when you do steal the popular vote from people, it becomes a dictatorial situation
[11:59.560 --> 12:05.560]  and then that's the only time violence begins to become a discussional issue.
[12:05.560 --> 12:09.120]  I mean, what are Bernie supporters supposed to do when they go vote for Bernie and then
[12:09.120 --> 12:10.120]  Hillary gets it?
[12:10.120 --> 12:11.360]  And I'm not advocating violence.
[12:11.360 --> 12:12.880]  Let's be clear.
[12:12.880 --> 12:17.080]  I'm simply saying at some point we're going down a road that now we understand why they
[12:17.080 --> 12:21.000]  won our guns because if it's going to be so dictatorial, it's going to get bad and we
[12:21.000 --> 12:25.720]  won't have a choice but to defend ourselves.
[12:25.720 --> 12:28.880]  Now the good news is Obama clearly wanted to have martial law.
[12:28.880 --> 12:33.080]  He tried to get special forces in regular army and Marines openly ready for it.
[12:33.080 --> 12:36.480]  They even tried to put it in the news the last few years like it was no big deal.
[12:36.480 --> 12:39.000]  Oh, we got our net kill switches in reeducation camps.
[12:39.000 --> 12:41.640]  They use that term, Soviet term.
[12:41.640 --> 12:44.880]  And yeah, we're training for insurrection to take over some cities and go after the
[12:44.880 --> 12:47.200]  Tea Party and veterans and gun owners and Christians.
[12:47.200 --> 12:48.560]  You saw all those stories.
[12:48.560 --> 12:49.680]  We tell you about it eight years ago.
[12:49.680 --> 12:50.680]  They deny it.
[12:50.680 --> 12:53.280]  Now they go, yeah, that's what we're geared up for.
[12:53.280 --> 13:00.000]  But what happens when you train the regular army, the regular Marines and even Air Force
[13:00.000 --> 13:05.920]  security in that, a lot of them wake up, then you train special forces people whose motto
[13:05.920 --> 13:11.480]  is free the oppress, stuff like that.
[13:11.480 --> 13:14.560]  That's the army's motto in Latin.
[13:14.560 --> 13:16.280]  I'm paraphrasing from memory.
[13:16.280 --> 13:21.640]  Will you guys pull up the green beret motto I believe is defend or free the oppress.
[13:21.640 --> 13:23.360]  I'm going from memory.
[13:23.360 --> 13:25.400]  SAS is fortune favors the bold.
[13:25.400 --> 13:32.160]  But the issue is, you think that woke them up when they were openly briefed?
[13:32.160 --> 13:34.360]  Yeah, we're looking at taking over governorships.
[13:34.360 --> 13:36.400]  We're looking at installing governors.
[13:36.400 --> 13:40.720]  That's why the military is so incredibly awake now and listens to this show because it's
[13:40.720 --> 13:44.640]  the only place they can tune in to hear what they actually heard behind closed doors.
[13:44.640 --> 13:49.160]  And they go, that guy knows everything down to the exact words.
[13:49.160 --> 13:53.520]  That's because I've reverse engineered their whole program for 20 years.
[13:53.520 --> 13:56.920]  The first year on air, I wasn't that informed, but a lot of old timers and people that had
[13:56.920 --> 14:02.080]  been in the military and in COG and in higher levels of government, they knew about it because
[14:02.080 --> 14:07.380]  these plans had been developed earlier, but not on a mass scale.
[14:07.380 --> 14:12.000]  They had developed the plans and had them very limited groups were aware of them, maybe
[14:12.000 --> 14:14.440]  a few thousand people.
[14:14.440 --> 14:19.440]  Now they're trying to get tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people ready to move
[14:19.440 --> 14:23.400]  with the COG takeover plans.
[14:23.400 --> 14:30.520]  And it is the biggest Bremen hot cup of high octane coffee to wake people up.
[14:30.520 --> 14:31.600]  This country's ever seen.
[14:31.600 --> 14:37.200]  So the globalists have made some miscalculations, but they've got their black lives matters,
[14:37.200 --> 14:41.040]  communist groups and others warmed up and ready for civil insurrection.
[14:41.040 --> 14:46.080]  That'll get mainline patriots of every race, color and creed to support the military on
[14:46.080 --> 14:50.080]  the streets because you'll need the military on the streets, but that's phase one.
[14:50.080 --> 14:52.740]  Once that's established, then they stage false flags.
[14:52.740 --> 14:54.240]  They blame the patriots.
[14:54.240 --> 14:58.080]  Then they start trying to arrest patriots and the military has to know that's the plan
[14:58.080 --> 14:59.840]  and they do know that's the plan.
[14:59.840 --> 15:01.400]  So good luck running that plan.
[15:01.400 --> 15:02.400]  New world order.
[15:02.400 --> 15:05.440]  So we're in kind of a Mexican standoff here.
[15:05.440 --> 15:07.320]  They'll say, oh, that's racist.
[15:07.320 --> 15:11.020]  That's how mentally ill political correctness has gotten now where you say, give me a white
[15:11.020 --> 15:12.020]  Russian.
[15:12.020 --> 15:17.840]  Why you bashing Russians know it's a Russian drink or a Moscow mule or a Mexican standoff
[15:17.840 --> 15:23.440]  is a term out of Mexico of where you got everybody pointing guns at each other in a room so that
[15:23.440 --> 15:27.040]  nobody can make a move without knowing they're about to get it.
[15:27.040 --> 15:32.240]  The most famous Mexican standoff is in the film, the good, the bad and the ugly with
[15:32.240 --> 15:39.840]  Lee Van Cleef and I forget the great actor that plays Tuko and then of course the immortal
[15:39.840 --> 15:45.280]  Denise Wood, but I digress and that's what we're in is a gigantic Mexican standoff of
[15:45.280 --> 15:50.120]  the new world order because they want to run this whole takeover program and not have people
[15:50.120 --> 15:51.760]  there reporting on it and exposing it.
[15:51.760 --> 15:56.240]  They're running a paradigm that's based on them controlling all the media.
[15:56.240 --> 15:59.000]  Now because they don't control it, they go, well, we'll just start censoring it and we'll
[15:59.000 --> 16:03.040]  start blocking it out.
[16:03.040 --> 16:08.240]  No, ladies and gentlemen, because we're aware of that program, so your attempt to move in
[16:08.240 --> 16:13.160]  with that only stirs up the Hornets desk that much more, so here's the bottom line.
[16:13.160 --> 16:18.120]  We're not winning the war, but we are in a Mexican standoff and we are gaining momentum
[16:18.120 --> 16:22.000]  and the enemy knows that.
[16:22.000 --> 16:29.760]  So the answer is to ram it into turbo gear, take off all the governors, fix our will on
[16:29.760 --> 16:35.760]  restoring the human awakening and we can have a new renaissance right like that because
[16:35.760 --> 16:41.120]  it's a spiritual deception that's over these zombies out there that don't know which end
[16:41.120 --> 16:42.280]  is up.
[16:42.280 --> 16:47.280]  It's not just educational, it's not just cultural, it is a spirit of jellyfish behavior.
[16:47.280 --> 16:53.040]  I watched last night during the live coverage for four hours, the crew did a great job.
[16:53.040 --> 16:59.080]  Our reporters all over the world from Germany to California to right here in Austin and
[16:59.080 --> 17:04.280]  our anchors doing a wonderful job and I, in between watching the live feed, I watched
[17:04.280 --> 17:08.240]  clip after clip of the people that Leigh Ann's interviewing, the Hillary supporters and the
[17:08.240 --> 17:17.560]  Bernie supporters, these are the most infantile jellyfish like, sad, stupid, unironic people.
[17:17.560 --> 17:22.360]  These are victims and I really almost cried.
[17:22.360 --> 17:26.680]  Look what they've done to them, but I just want to see light back in their eyes, I want
[17:26.680 --> 17:31.120]  to see them understand what real prosperity is, I want to see them just have some basic
[17:31.120 --> 17:35.880]  understanding of what's being done to them and I want to see them awake and alive.
[17:35.880 --> 17:40.200]  I'm telling you, liberals, I don't care if they're black, white or Hispanic or Asian,
[17:40.200 --> 17:42.960]  they all look like somebody sucked the soul out of them.
[17:42.960 --> 17:47.120]  Look, there's no fire in their eyes, they stutter, they can hardly talk, they don't
[17:47.120 --> 18:00.320]  know geography, politics, they just know how to say LGBT, homophobe, racist, transphobic,
[18:00.320 --> 18:06.840]  we need tranny bathrooms, I mean, look what they've done to them, look what this dependence
[18:06.840 --> 18:12.920]  has done to them and I'm not defending conservatives, that's its own wrecked mentally ill, rhino
[18:12.920 --> 18:19.240]  run thing, but I mean, these people are all just gibbering idiots who think they're in
[18:19.240 --> 18:23.480]  power because Hillary's about to win or think they're in power because Bernie's about to
[18:23.480 --> 18:28.080]  win, who are getting reflected glory from it and feel like they're succeeding.
[18:28.080 --> 18:37.240]  These are children, these are childlike minds, they are victims, they are like a child climbing
[18:37.240 --> 18:44.240]  in a perv van thinking they're about to pet a puppy and get some candy and really culturally,
[18:44.240 --> 18:48.880]  incrementally, they're about to be hung up by their feet, their throat slit, their guts
[18:48.880 --> 18:53.360]  hung out and wolves are about to dine on them at their extreme leisure.
[18:53.360 --> 18:58.160]  Okay, I've got to stop the ranting, there's like 15 clips, I've got so many guests coming

[23:13.840 --> 23:16.160]  Hi, this is Ron Paul.
[23:16.160 --> 23:20.280]  I'm a former 22-year congressman and Republican presidential candidate.
[23:20.280 --> 23:24.160]  I'm here to tell you about something that just might save your lives.
[23:24.160 --> 23:28.120]  You never know when there will be another Katrina, an economic collapse or a serious
[23:28.120 --> 23:29.120]  drought.
[23:29.120 --> 23:32.560]  We should all have a little food storage that will carry us through tough times.
[23:32.560 --> 23:35.360]  I'm going to tell you about a great way to do that.
[23:35.360 --> 23:40.880]  A U.S. company named HarvestRite has a kitchen appliance that can help you be prepared.
[23:40.880 --> 23:42.560]  It's a home freeze-dryer.

[23:50.720 --> 23:52.640]  I've tried it and it's amazing.
[23:52.640 --> 23:56.840]  With a home freeze-dryer from HarvestRite, you can literally freeze-dry anything you
[23:56.840 --> 23:59.640]  eat, even things like ice cream.
[23:59.640 --> 24:06.640]  To learn more, call...
[24:06.640 --> 24:15.240]  All right, we've got huge Bilderberg developments on the cashless society that they're pushing
[24:15.240 --> 24:20.560]  on imploding Europe, similar model for imploding our borders, our reporters Paul Watson and
[24:20.560 --> 24:25.000]  Rob Dillby reporting popping up in the next segment.
[24:25.000 --> 24:30.400]  I have other incredible news here that's going to be coming up in the next segment.
[24:30.400 --> 24:32.240]  Wait till you hear this.
[24:32.240 --> 24:37.520]  The police are now, already started this in Oklahoma, using electronic card readers at
[24:37.520 --> 24:43.200]  a distance that beam at you and then suck the money out of your credit cards, basically
[24:43.200 --> 24:47.160]  a hacking device that criminals have used previously, claiming if you owe the government
[24:47.160 --> 24:48.840]  money, they just take it right away.
[24:48.840 --> 24:52.400]  Or if they think you've been caught with something illegal, they just take your money
[24:52.400 --> 24:53.400]  on the spot.
[24:53.400 --> 24:56.600]  This is all part of the federal asset for which are seizure garbage.
[24:56.600 --> 24:57.880]  This is the police state.
[24:57.880 --> 24:59.040]  This is pure evil.
[24:59.040 --> 25:02.600]  And the police need to reverse this and oppose this.
[25:02.600 --> 25:07.560]  You know, we're not here just hating the police because that just helps the globalist overall.
[25:07.560 --> 25:11.880]  We hate the people running the police that are stomping on our constitution.
[25:11.880 --> 25:17.360]  Another article just went up on infowars.com, Napolitano, FBI plan to access browser history
[25:17.360 --> 25:19.920]  major steps towards police state.
[25:19.920 --> 25:20.920]  So that's coming up.
[25:20.920 --> 25:24.000]  Now, let me get into the election news.
[25:24.000 --> 25:25.000]  This is big.
[25:25.000 --> 25:26.000]  The stack of news.
[25:26.000 --> 25:29.080]  I'm going to come back, play some Trump clips and then go to Germany with our reporter standing
[25:29.080 --> 25:31.800]  by Clinton.
[25:31.800 --> 25:34.400]  Trump debate will be a singular moment in American history.
[25:34.400 --> 25:37.840]  And if he savages her, he will defeat her.
[25:37.840 --> 25:41.920]  The problem is if she's robbing Bernie Sanders, she'll try to rob Trump and Trump has had record
[25:41.920 --> 25:46.040]  numbers now over 3 million people in the Republican party that weren't there previous.
[25:46.040 --> 25:49.960]  Hillary get this has less voters this time.
[25:49.960 --> 25:52.080]  I'm going to get to that article.
[25:52.080 --> 25:55.760]  Then she did last time losing the nomination, but it doesn't matter.
[25:55.760 --> 25:59.400]  She has super delegates.
[25:59.400 --> 26:06.400]  Oh, Democratic primaries Clinton claims nomination victory Washington Post.
[26:06.400 --> 26:07.400]  She claims it.
[26:07.400 --> 26:11.320]  Now, everybody else went historic moment and all these weird men got there and went, I
[26:11.320 --> 26:13.240]  think it's great women are now in charge.
[26:13.240 --> 26:14.760]  Oh, yeah, women are now in charge.
[26:14.760 --> 26:18.920]  I'd love to have a woman president if she was a patriot, not about her being a woman.
[26:18.920 --> 26:23.360]  She's a crime boss for heaven's sakes.
[26:23.360 --> 26:29.000]  Rasmussen super delegate system created to keep outsiders like Sanders out.
[26:29.000 --> 26:30.000]  Do.
[26:30.000 --> 26:31.000]  Absolutely.
[26:31.000 --> 26:32.000]  That's from Newsmax.
[26:32.000 --> 26:37.720]  And then here it is even out of New York Daily News, super liberal.
[26:37.720 --> 26:43.000]  Hillary Clinton has not won the Democratic primary boom.
[26:43.000 --> 26:48.440]  And then it goes on to say a group of super delegates met in secret and then they decided
[26:48.440 --> 26:50.480]  what the delegates came and told them what the numbers were.
[26:50.480 --> 26:57.720]  And then they put that on the news that she'd won just like they did in New Hampshire, except
[26:57.720 --> 27:01.680]  there they said Sanders won, but a day later said, sorry, yeah, about 20 points, but she
[27:01.680 --> 27:09.160]  gets the delegates and they had arrogant super delegates on TV going, yeah, I count.
[27:09.160 --> 27:12.400]  That's why I'm wearing today on air the Hillary for present shirt.
[27:12.400 --> 27:16.400]  Usually we're in a sports jacket in here to respect the show, but you know, it's time.
[27:16.400 --> 27:18.160]  Hillary for present.
[27:18.160 --> 27:23.280]  For all of her crimes, these hundreds of them that are admitted.
[27:23.280 --> 27:25.540]  It's incredible.
[27:25.540 --> 27:29.800]  On Monday, on the eve of the most important day of the primary on a day where not a single
[27:29.800 --> 27:34.080]  vote was cast, Hillary Clinton was surprisingly declared the winner of the Democratic primary
[27:34.080 --> 27:38.640]  Tuesday was scheduled to be the single biggest day of the entire Democratic primary, but
[27:38.640 --> 27:45.480]  it wasn't because it had already been decided because 694 were going to be pledged delegates
[27:45.480 --> 27:46.480]  up for grabs.
[27:46.480 --> 27:52.040]  New Jersey, North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, New Mexico in the past 45 days alone, more
[27:52.040 --> 27:57.680]  than 650,000 new voters registered in California on the state announced 70% of available voter
[27:57.680 --> 27:58.680]  registration.
[27:58.680 --> 28:02.560]  It was the highest percentage of people ever registered for primaries in the state.
[28:02.560 --> 28:05.360]  This should have been a celebration of the Democratic party is welcome record numbers
[28:05.360 --> 28:07.080]  of new voters the fold.
[28:07.080 --> 28:11.000]  Instead, something far more nefarious and underhanded had happened.
[28:11.000 --> 28:14.920]  New voters didn't put Hillary Clinton on the top.
[28:14.920 --> 28:19.440]  Pledge delegates didn't steal the deal, didn't steal the deal.
[28:19.440 --> 28:22.200]  It wasn't a recount of primary caucuses.
[28:22.200 --> 28:25.880]  It was a survey, an anonymous survey.
[28:25.880 --> 28:30.520]  That's what said she won.
[28:30.520 --> 28:34.800]  This AP secret survey of super delegates, that's what they use the next day to announce
[28:34.800 --> 28:38.840]  because AP handles the vote, formerly voter new services, but they ran it.
[28:38.840 --> 28:41.760]  Now they just call it AP.
[28:41.760 --> 28:42.760]  And it decided.
[28:42.760 --> 28:47.760]  Yes, you read that correctly, a survey, the Associated Press conducted a secret survey
[28:47.760 --> 28:51.760]  of super delegates in which they promised to protect their identities and determine
[28:51.760 --> 28:55.880]  that just enough of them, the perfect number actually said they intended to vote for Hillary
[28:55.880 --> 28:57.920]  50 days from now to a Democratic convention.
[28:57.920 --> 29:02.120]  And then that was announced the next day after you went and pulled the lever.
[29:02.120 --> 29:05.680]  Oh, but I'm a conspiracy theorist.
[29:05.680 --> 29:10.440]  I told you our government was funding Al Qaeda in Syria and that they changed the name to
[29:10.440 --> 29:12.880]  ISIS to confuse people three years ago.
[29:12.880 --> 29:17.360]  And then Cy Hirsch released it in New Yorker magazine and London review of books and then
[29:17.360 --> 29:21.680]  wanted to come on my show and say, thank you, Alex, you broke some of this.
[29:21.680 --> 29:22.680]  You're part of the story.
[29:22.680 --> 29:23.680]  The Pulitzer Prize winner.
[29:23.680 --> 29:25.400]  And I'm not bragging.
[29:25.400 --> 29:29.400]  I'm just saying I got all that from the army.
[29:29.400 --> 29:30.400]  That's the heroes.
[29:30.400 --> 29:35.240]  Oh, but I'm a conspiracy theorist when I say the super delegates are stealing or that our
[29:35.240 --> 29:39.960]  government funds Al Qaeda, no, that's a pseudo intellectual garbage term.
[29:39.960 --> 29:43.600]  They use for unintellectual idiots to go, oh, that's a tinfoil hat.
[29:43.600 --> 29:44.600]  That's a crackpot.
[29:44.600 --> 29:45.600]  Hillary's our lady.
[29:45.600 --> 29:48.600]  You're just afraid of women.
[29:48.600 --> 29:50.560]  Now I'm afraid of stolen elections.
[29:50.560 --> 29:51.840]  We're on the March.
[29:51.840 --> 29:54.240]  The Empire's on the run.
[29:54.240 --> 29:57.640]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:57.640 --> 30:05.000]  A staunch anti-Federalist, Patrick Kinrie was opposed to the Constitution fearing it
[30:05.000 --> 30:08.960]  would become a monster that would take over not only the sovereign states that had created
[30:08.960 --> 30:12.320]  it, but that it would become a tool to destroy individual liberty.
[30:12.320 --> 30:15.320]  His warnings ignored have now come to pass.
[30:15.320 --> 30:19.640]  He said, you're not to inquire how your trade may be increased, nor how you were to become
[30:19.640 --> 30:23.880]  a great and powerful people, but how your liberties can be secured.
[30:23.880 --> 30:26.800]  For liberty ought to be the direct end of your government.
[30:26.800 --> 30:31.200]  Patrick Henry warned us, the liberties of a people never were, nor ever will be secure
[30:31.200 --> 30:34.880]  when the transactions of their rulers may be concealed from them.
[30:34.880 --> 30:39.280]  Today, everything the government does at every level is concealed from us.
[30:39.280 --> 30:43.000]  We have trade deals to manage our economy that not even our elected representatives
[30:43.000 --> 30:44.320]  are allowed to see.
[30:44.320 --> 30:47.920]  Later in life, Patrick Henry looked back and said, when the American spirit was in its
[30:47.920 --> 30:50.640]  youth, the language of America was different.
[30:50.640 --> 30:52.480]  Liberty, sir, was the primary object.
[30:52.480 --> 30:58.480]  Today, our primary concern is safety and comfort, when we should be demanding liberty.
[30:58.480 --> 31:05.480]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[31:58.480 --> 32:07.160]  We're introducing the best yet, the brand new Pro Pure Pro Max High Performance Shower

[32:39.440 --> 32:42.720]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.

[33:36.640 --> 33:45.480]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[33:45.480 --> 33:49.120]  Last night in California put me in a haze.
[33:49.120 --> 33:51.480]  Sanders, almost everybody on the street says they're voting for him.
[33:51.480 --> 33:53.120]  He has rallies of 50,000.
[33:53.120 --> 33:56.000]  Hillary can't get a thousand.
[33:56.000 --> 34:03.400]  She steals primaries openly, puts superdelegates in the AP, canvases superdelegates the night
[34:03.400 --> 34:09.040]  before and then already have the election results that they ran the next day.
[34:09.040 --> 34:12.520]  Oh, they're a criminal band, aren't they?
[34:12.520 --> 34:14.080]  They're coming to your town.
[34:14.080 --> 34:17.360]  They're going to rob you down.
[34:17.360 --> 34:18.360]  Get ready.
[34:18.360 --> 34:25.040]  There's Paul Watson right there outside the Bilderberg Group Meeting Hotel by the Presidential
[34:25.040 --> 34:30.320]  Imperial Palace, formerly the King's Palace, where the royalty is meeting.
[34:30.320 --> 34:32.800]  And then we're going to be talking to him here in just a moment.
[34:32.800 --> 34:33.800]  We have their agenda.
[34:33.800 --> 34:34.800]  This is huge.
[34:34.800 --> 34:38.320]  It's up on DrudgeReport.com, Infowars.com, you name it.
[34:38.320 --> 34:42.000]  We have one of the Hillary superdelegates months and months ago, back during the New
[34:42.000 --> 34:47.960]  Hampshire primary, saying it doesn't matter if he wins all the votes.
[34:47.960 --> 34:52.160]  I'm a California superdelegate out here in New Hampshire helping run things, and I'm
[34:52.160 --> 34:54.880]  going to give my vote to Hillary.
[34:54.880 --> 34:58.080]  We got his name and everything, but you see, they just did it.
[34:58.080 --> 35:01.000]  And some Democrats are in the news going, this is horrible.
[35:01.000 --> 35:03.600]  Yes, you're going to be called a crackpot now.
[35:03.600 --> 35:06.720]  They'll go, there was never a vote.
[35:06.720 --> 35:09.160]  There was never a vote.
[35:09.160 --> 35:14.640]  There's the article, Kent Daniels, February 12, 2016, Hillary superdelegate.
[35:14.640 --> 35:15.800]  Why your vote doesn't count.
[35:15.800 --> 35:23.080]  If you scroll down, there's the video, Bob Mulholland, we're going to play that later.
[35:23.080 --> 35:25.120]  Just wanted to show everybody that.
[35:25.120 --> 35:29.840]  I love his little arrogance, his little piggy arrogance, all the little goodie indulgences
[35:29.840 --> 35:36.280]  and knickknacks and, and, and, and, and royal giblets, uh, you know, little, little baronies
[35:36.280 --> 35:42.600]  or little duchies that, that are doled out to little mini visor eyes on a regular basis.
[35:42.600 --> 35:47.560]  In fact, we have the clip now, let's just play this, then I'll go to the guys in Germany,
[35:47.560 --> 35:51.240]  then the best, most powerful Trump clips ever.
[35:51.240 --> 35:57.160]  But first here is the superdelegate openly bragging the info wars.
[35:57.160 --> 35:58.760]  Here it is.
[35:58.760 --> 36:03.400]  We're here at the Red Arrow Diner and we've gone further down the bar here and we've found
[36:03.400 --> 36:04.400]  this gentleman.
[36:04.400 --> 36:05.400]  What's your name?
[36:05.400 --> 36:06.400]  Bob Mulholland from Chico, California.
[36:06.400 --> 36:07.400]  I'm a DNC member.
[36:07.400 --> 36:09.920]  That's a superdelegate to the national convention.
[36:09.920 --> 36:14.560]  Wow, so that's the first time I can think of that I've talked with a democratic superdelegate.
[36:14.560 --> 36:18.680]  Tell us how long have you been a superdelegate, how long have you been a delegate, and tell
[36:18.680 --> 36:21.680]  us a little bit more about the process of how you get to be a superdelegate.
[36:21.680 --> 36:25.560]  There's several ways, but I, this will be my 11th national convention.
[36:25.560 --> 36:28.280]  I've been a superdelegate since 1992.
[36:28.280 --> 36:31.840]  In our case in California, you have to get elected by the California Democratic Party
[36:31.840 --> 36:33.120]  to be on the DNC.
[36:33.120 --> 36:36.760]  Obviously, Democratic governors are automatic superdelegates.
[36:36.760 --> 36:41.560]  So understandably that it sounds like Hillary is going to have a huge edge when it comes
[36:41.560 --> 36:42.560]  to superdelegates.
[36:42.560 --> 36:43.560]  Is that correct?
[36:43.560 --> 36:44.560]  Oh, yeah.
[36:44.560 --> 36:48.920]  And former DNC chairs like Howard Dean, who's from Vermont, he's known Bernie for decades.
[36:48.920 --> 36:49.920]  He's for Hillary.
[36:49.920 --> 36:50.920]  Yeah.
[36:50.920 --> 36:55.000]  The people who have worked with Hillary for decades are big supporters of her.
[36:55.000 --> 36:59.320]  If they haven't said so yet, they will over the next several weeks.
[36:59.320 --> 37:04.880]  So roughly when it comes to democratic national convention, what is the rough total of delegates
[37:04.880 --> 37:08.240]  that are going to be available for the DNC?
[37:08.240 --> 37:10.000]  Right now about 4,800.
[37:10.000 --> 37:14.240]  So you need about almost 2,400 to get the nomination.
[37:14.240 --> 37:19.240]  And the way we work is that anybody who gets 15% more in election gets delegates.
[37:19.240 --> 37:21.520]  So this election will go all the way to California.
[37:21.520 --> 37:25.680]  Sanders will end up with well over 1,000 delegates, and Hillary will get the nomination.
[37:25.680 --> 37:26.680]  Okay.
[37:26.680 --> 37:31.320]  Now, the superdelegates, there's mostly what Hillary...
[37:31.320 --> 37:35.920]  See the full video up on infowars.com in that original article that we should flash back.
[37:35.920 --> 37:41.600]  Now, he did it better than the Republicans, Priebus and Curly, whatever his name was.
[37:41.600 --> 37:45.160]  It was all over TV going, listen, it doesn't matter how you vote.
[37:45.160 --> 37:46.320]  You can do 100%.
[37:46.320 --> 37:47.320]  We decide.
[37:47.320 --> 37:53.120]  Or George Will, writing for the Washington Post, he just said, look, we don't go with
[37:53.120 --> 37:56.880]  a mere plurality of the public and the majority.
[37:56.880 --> 38:00.080]  There's sovereignty, he said of this party.
[38:00.080 --> 38:08.560]  Royalty, royalty, like the Bilderberg meeting in the royal, the former German royalty complex
[38:08.560 --> 38:09.560]  right now.
[38:09.560 --> 38:10.560]  Here's some of the headlines.
[38:10.560 --> 38:13.800]  Bilderberg, leak, secretive group, discuss internet ID, global tax.
[38:13.800 --> 38:20.920]  We're going to go to them here in just a moment, but briefly, ladies and gentlemen,
[38:20.920 --> 38:27.920]  we have a new product back in stock that's been sold out for five months.
[38:27.920 --> 38:32.160]  In fact, it's been sold out so long that I almost said, just change the formula, but
[38:32.160 --> 38:33.680]  Dr. Group didn't want to do it.
[38:33.680 --> 38:40.800]  It is the ultimate cleanse for all sorts of different parasites from bacteria right down
[38:40.800 --> 38:42.320]  to you name it.
[38:42.320 --> 38:43.640]  And it has dramatic effects.
[38:43.640 --> 38:44.960]  It has incredible reviews.
[38:44.960 --> 38:46.480]  It's back in stock.
[38:46.480 --> 38:47.480]  The statistics are clear.
[38:47.480 --> 38:50.840]  Nine out of 10 people are infested with harmful organisms like Hillary Clinton.
[38:50.840 --> 38:53.160]  I'm sorry, I won't get rid of her and make sarcastic.
[38:53.160 --> 38:57.040]  Once these organisms have made it inside your body, they steal your nutrients and release
[38:57.040 --> 38:59.400]  toxic waste.
[38:59.400 --> 39:03.000]  It's time to start eliminating toxic and harmful organisms from your body, the worms
[39:03.000 --> 39:05.200]  and stuff crap inside you folks.
[39:05.200 --> 39:10.760]  Our InfoWarsLife Living Defense Harmful Organism Cleanser is now back in stock at InfoWarsLife.com.
[39:10.760 --> 39:13.360]  I almost discontinued this because it's so hard to get the ingredients and it's been
[39:13.360 --> 39:15.360]  gone forever.
[39:15.360 --> 39:18.600]  Everything we got to have everything past California standards and it's almost impossible
[39:18.600 --> 39:20.080]  and we get the only best organic.
[39:20.080 --> 39:23.200]  It's just folks know what we get five stars.
[39:23.200 --> 39:26.600]  Living Defense uses organic herbs and enzymes to help naturally cleanse harmful organisms
[39:26.600 --> 39:31.080]  from the body, stock up and start cleansing now at InfoWarsLife.com.
[39:31.080 --> 39:33.080]  Before we sell out again, that's InfoWarsLife.com.
[39:33.080 --> 39:34.080]  Yeah.
[39:34.080 --> 39:37.960]  And we're really trying to up the production to be able to not run out.
[39:37.960 --> 39:44.320]  Here is Vic in Tucson, Arizona says, Living Defense, this is done with deep cleanse and
[39:44.320 --> 39:46.120]  neither had side effects.
[39:46.120 --> 39:50.400]  Easiest cleanse I've ever done with the ingredients of the product is terrific and well-priced.
[39:50.400 --> 39:52.080]  Thank you, Alex and crew.
[39:52.080 --> 39:54.640]  Here's one from Dan in Spring Hill, Florida.
[39:54.640 --> 39:58.280]  Living Defense is awesome, taking Living Defense daily now has made a huge impact on
[39:58.280 --> 40:00.120]  my health and feeling a wellness.
[40:00.120 --> 40:01.560]  You have to try it for yourself.
[40:01.560 --> 40:03.680]  It's also really good for a lot of other levels.
[40:03.680 --> 40:04.680]  Just go read all the ingredients.
[40:04.680 --> 40:07.160]  It's got the kitchen sink in it.
[40:07.160 --> 40:09.600]  So that's some of the exciting things that are happening right now.
[40:09.600 --> 40:14.680]  A secret 12 is a super high quality organic form of absorbable vitamin B12.
[40:14.680 --> 40:16.520]  Most people can't absorb B12 in the stomach.
[40:16.520 --> 40:21.200]  It has to be absorbed through injections or in the mouth, preferably under the tongue.
[40:21.200 --> 40:22.200]  That's what this is for.
[40:22.200 --> 40:27.640]  It's 80% methylcobalamin, then it has 20% another form of vitamin B12 that helps absorb
[40:27.640 --> 40:28.640]  it.
[40:28.640 --> 40:29.640]  What is it?
[40:29.640 --> 40:30.640]  Cenedylcobalamin?
[40:30.640 --> 40:31.640]  I'm probably pronouncing it wrong.
[40:31.640 --> 40:32.640]  Just go read why.
[40:32.640 --> 40:40.160]  This is the ultimate formula from our research in FullWarsLife.com or call toll free, 888-253-3139.
[40:40.160 --> 40:45.760]  And don't forget we have a new system from AlexaPure that is the AlexaPure Breeze 4-stage
[40:45.760 --> 40:51.680]  incredible filter does 800 square feet to 99.99% with four different filters, different
[40:51.680 --> 40:55.200]  technologies, four different ones, it runs almost silent.
[40:55.200 --> 40:58.880]  Comparable units are up to $1,000 and you can get some other decent ones for $400.
[40:58.880 --> 41:01.840]  It is, ladies and gentlemen, still on sale.
[41:01.840 --> 41:03.480]  I didn't just keep running this sale.
[41:03.480 --> 41:09.760]  I heard the ad running and I guess our ad guy is at a conference and so I'm like, wow,
[41:09.760 --> 41:13.040]  that special is supposed to be gone, pull that ad thinking that it wouldn't be on the
[41:13.040 --> 41:15.920]  shopping cart for 26% off out of the gates.
[41:15.920 --> 41:19.360]  But it's still extended because the special has not been taken down.
[41:19.360 --> 41:22.040]  But you know what, I'm extending it until next week.
[41:22.040 --> 41:23.040]  Boom.
[41:23.040 --> 41:26.840]  I don't even know I'm authorized to do that, but I'm here and trainwrecks, we will turn
[41:26.840 --> 41:28.080]  into lemonade.
[41:28.080 --> 41:30.800]  Big fat giant lemons, they are now lemonade for you.
[41:30.800 --> 41:33.800]  I wonder why the sales of it were still so high.
[41:33.800 --> 41:38.760]  This unit is cheap at $300, incredibly cheap at $224 like it normally is.
[41:38.760 --> 41:45.920]  It's $180 right now in FullWarsStore.com out of the gates, only exclusively here.
[41:45.920 --> 41:49.800]  It's the same folks that make Alexa Pure Pro and all the great water filtration systems
[41:49.800 --> 41:57.200]  that you can get 10% off with promo code water and get free shipping on orders $50 or more
[41:57.200 --> 41:58.200]  and get 10% off.
[41:58.200 --> 42:03.320]  It's not for auto ship on things like living defense or things like X2 or things like liver
[42:03.320 --> 42:04.320]  shield.
[42:04.320 --> 42:08.160]  I mean, it's all there in FullWarsLife.com is the Nutraceuticals, in FullWarsStore.com
[42:08.160 --> 42:13.120]  is the umbrella site, in FullWarsHealth.com is the full line of amazing longevity products,
[42:13.120 --> 42:17.400]  Nutraceuticals and when you purchase it there, the biggest discounts that are out there,
[42:17.400 --> 42:22.000]  we make a small amount of money off each sale and also helps fund the operation in FullWarsHealth.com.
[42:22.000 --> 42:25.320]  Okay, shifting gears.
[42:25.320 --> 42:26.560]  We have had such a victory.
[42:26.560 --> 42:31.680]  We have the London Guardian, we have the London Independent, we have US newspapers and publications
[42:31.680 --> 42:37.640]  and CNBC, thanks to Drudge helping break the blockade 10 years ago and of course, in FullWars
[42:37.640 --> 42:40.000]  and others.
[42:40.000 --> 42:44.520]  We now have them going, okay, global elite, our meetings setting policy for world government
[42:44.520 --> 42:50.040]  and local governments are upset and the public's upset and is this legal?
[42:50.040 --> 42:55.280]  And yes, their meeting and our sources say that they're talking about carbon taxes, internet
[42:55.280 --> 42:58.720]  taxes, which is internet ID to control and track what you do and kick you off the web
[42:58.720 --> 43:00.880]  if they want and it's this whole nightmare scenario.
[43:00.880 --> 43:05.480]  So this is such a gigantic victory that now people are saying, you know, the EU bureaucracy
[43:05.480 --> 43:09.400]  was set up by them and no one voted to enter it and it's dictatorial.
[43:09.400 --> 43:11.040]  How did this ever happen?
[43:11.040 --> 43:18.080]  See, once you start talking about shadow groups that run the EU and the NAU, they set up that
[43:18.080 --> 43:23.640]  are now having politicians sign our sovereignty over to, it's the beginning of the end.
[43:23.640 --> 43:29.480]  See, the ultimate dictatorship has to be invisible, but we're shining light on it.
[43:29.480 --> 43:31.240]  Toto's pulling the curtain back.
[43:31.240 --> 43:34.960]  This is big, big, big.
[43:34.960 --> 43:36.320]  And who went to Bilderberg?
[43:36.320 --> 43:38.720]  Many times, Herr Hitlery.
[43:38.720 --> 43:41.040]  Who went, but he was just an obscure governor.
[43:41.040 --> 43:43.040]  Oh, Bill Clinton.
[43:43.040 --> 43:44.040]  And we're over there.
[43:44.040 --> 43:45.760]  The Germans come up to our reporters.
[43:45.760 --> 43:48.280]  They know about it.
[43:48.280 --> 43:52.840]  So to give us the latest on this, this is Paul Joseph Watson, who got the Bilderberg group
[43:52.840 --> 43:56.200]  list, got it out first, dredgereport.com, link to it, and we're still dominating coverage.
[43:56.200 --> 43:57.360]  I'm very proud of our crew.
[43:57.360 --> 44:01.680]  Paul, you're there, just a hop, skipping a jump from where you normally live in London,
[44:01.680 --> 44:03.360]  but you're in Germany.
[44:03.360 --> 44:05.200]  Tell us what you've discovered there.
[44:05.200 --> 44:10.720]  Well, getting in was interesting, Alex, because of course I came from Prague, flew to Prague
[44:10.720 --> 44:16.040]  from London, and then got the train from Prague into Dresden, got a little bit of a light
[44:16.040 --> 44:18.080]  grilling by the German border police.
[44:18.080 --> 44:22.000]  They want us to know where I'd come from, where I was going, what I was doing, probably
[44:22.000 --> 44:26.880]  more invasive questions than some of the Syrian migrants would get coming into Germany.
[44:26.880 --> 44:28.080]  They don't even allow screening of them.
[44:28.080 --> 44:29.080]  They admit that.
[44:29.080 --> 44:30.080]  Go ahead.
[44:30.080 --> 44:36.040]  What was even more interesting though was getting in the taxi, talking to the taxi driver,
[44:36.040 --> 44:41.240]  and just driving past the train station here in Dresden, because as I was getting in, the
[44:41.240 --> 44:45.320]  police were arresting migrants for drug dealing around the train station.
[44:45.320 --> 44:46.800]  They were actually putting them in the police car.
[44:46.800 --> 44:49.000]  Oh, police, did you get video of that on your phone?
[44:49.000 --> 44:54.360]  No, because I was speeding past in the taxi, but the taxi driver said that this is a huge
[44:54.360 --> 44:56.000]  problem recently.
[44:56.000 --> 44:59.600]  Tunisian drug dealers around the area, that's their turf.
[44:59.600 --> 45:00.600]  That's where they go.
[45:00.600 --> 45:05.400]  He said that the police are arresting them almost on a daily basis, but then they get
[45:05.400 --> 45:08.640]  out of jail the next day and they're back on the streets.
[45:08.640 --> 45:13.880]  So the very first conversation I had, I didn't even bring up the subject, and he started
[45:13.880 --> 45:18.520]  talking about how they brought in 5,000 of these migrants, about how the crime has risen
[45:18.520 --> 45:19.520]  in Germany.
[45:19.520 --> 45:26.000]  In fact, there's a report out of Reuters on infowars.com right now, which says that 69,000
[45:26.000 --> 45:30.480]  crimes have been attributed to migrants in the first quarter of 2016.
[45:30.480 --> 45:35.920]  But the spin, the lie, is that they say that's, quote, disproportionately low for migrants.
[45:35.920 --> 45:41.520]  But if you actually drill into the reports, the German crime statistics for the past year,
[45:41.520 --> 45:44.680]  there are 400,000 crimes committed by migrants.
[45:44.680 --> 45:49.520]  They're overrepresented in terms of their population by two to one.
[45:49.520 --> 45:50.520]  So they're around.
[45:50.520 --> 45:51.520]  Well, look at Rape alone.
[45:51.520 --> 45:52.520]  Look at Rape alone, Paul.
[45:52.520 --> 45:53.520]  Yeah.
[45:53.520 --> 45:57.120]  I brought that up as well, and he said that, you know, there's a big coverup regarding
[45:57.120 --> 45:59.000]  that as we know.
[45:59.000 --> 46:03.520]  So this lie we've been told, I mean, obviously we've got the huge Brexit thing going on in
[46:03.520 --> 46:04.720]  the UK right now.
[46:04.720 --> 46:11.240]  Nigel Farage went on a debate show last night and merely brought up what happened in Cologne.
[46:11.240 --> 46:16.160]  Immediately the next day, in every single British newspaper, he was being attacked as
[46:16.160 --> 46:21.440]  a racist by the Archbishop as a racist, simply for bringing attention to what happened in
[46:21.440 --> 46:26.640]  Cologne and saying, bringing in this number of people at such a pace, given the criminality
[46:26.640 --> 46:29.560]  that we've seen, might be a bit of a problem.
[46:29.560 --> 46:32.380]  He was castigated as a racist for doing so.
[46:32.380 --> 46:37.640]  So now the media is starting to admit that this is an issue, but they're blaming it on
[46:37.640 --> 46:38.640]  right wingers.
[46:38.640 --> 46:43.000]  In fact, in the police report that they released here back in May, it was a couple of weeks
[46:43.000 --> 46:49.200]  ago now, they blamed the rise in crime on the German right wing committing thought crimes,
[46:49.200 --> 46:52.800]  you know, going on Facebook and God forbid criticising their government's mind.
[46:52.800 --> 46:55.440]  Well, that's like the mayor of Cologne said it's the women's fault.
[46:55.440 --> 46:57.440]  They're getting raped because they're too hot.
[46:57.440 --> 46:58.440]  Yeah.
[46:58.440 --> 47:03.280]  And in fact, there was a report out of Norway a couple of weeks ago where they're seeing
[47:03.280 --> 47:09.440]  a similar rise in crime and the media there blamed it on Nordic drinking culture.
[47:09.440 --> 47:11.440]  Like there's never been drinking culture in Norway before.
[47:11.440 --> 47:16.480]  Look, this is an absolute program of evil and it's intensifying and this is the breakdown
[47:16.480 --> 47:17.800]  of Europe into the Middle East.
[47:17.800 --> 47:21.120]  This is the the implosion of the U.S. into Latin America.
[47:21.120 --> 47:23.120]  This is the the world government.
[47:23.120 --> 47:24.280]  We're seeing the formation.
[47:24.280 --> 47:28.680]  This is what Peter Southerlman founded the EU said it would be the head of the EU then
[47:28.680 --> 47:32.880]  goes down to be the head of the migrant board who advertises opens the border brings them
[47:32.880 --> 47:33.880]  in.
[47:33.880 --> 47:37.880]  Now, Paul, from my sources and relaying to you and your sources, we have the Bilderberg
[47:37.880 --> 47:41.600]  leak secretive group to discuss Internet ID, global tax.
[47:41.600 --> 47:42.600]  Let's get to that.
[47:42.600 --> 47:43.600]  That's big.
[47:43.600 --> 47:49.360]  Well, of course, they've been pushing this Internet ID in Communist China for at least
[47:49.360 --> 47:50.360]  10 years.
[47:50.360 --> 47:53.240]  Now, in fact, Lieberman came out and called for it, you know, 10 years ago.
[47:53.240 --> 47:59.120]  Now, this online ID where they can track descent by linking it to a social credit score.
[47:59.120 --> 48:03.800]  Now, in China, they've started off with one of the big corporations, Ali Baba.
[48:03.800 --> 48:06.880]  And the Communist government is starting to adopt it.
[48:06.880 --> 48:08.360]  That's the second phase of it.
[48:08.360 --> 48:13.360]  And it links what people buy online, what comments they make on social media to their
[48:13.360 --> 48:14.760]  credit score.
[48:14.760 --> 48:20.440]  So if they get downvoted by other loyal, obedient citizens, their credit score goes down.
[48:20.440 --> 48:23.040]  They have less privilege, less access to the Internet.
[48:23.040 --> 48:26.680]  Of course, we see that on Reddit, the people who get upvoted more get more privileged.
[48:26.680 --> 48:31.960]  And that's what the EU, that's what the EU proposal, which is the bureaucracy runs thing.
[48:31.960 --> 48:35.320]  Just last week, they proposed that and said, just like the Chinese model, they'll have
[48:35.320 --> 48:37.480]  that social score.
[48:37.480 --> 48:43.480]  Exactly, because studies show that people read news articles on the Internet and they
[48:43.480 --> 48:47.760]  don't necessarily believe the narrative in the actual article.
[48:47.760 --> 48:52.080]  In some cases, they go immediately to the comments and see what other people are saying.
[48:52.080 --> 48:56.560]  And because the comments are so drastically in favor of, you know, the kind of narratives
[48:56.560 --> 49:01.440]  that we're all about and against this dominant narrative that multiculturalism and diversity
[49:01.440 --> 49:05.640]  is working great, which it clearly isn't, they're afraid of that because people are
[49:05.640 --> 49:10.160]  reading the comments and getting their narrative from that, rather than the spin being put
[49:10.160 --> 49:11.520]  out by the media.
[49:11.520 --> 49:15.720]  So that's why we've seen major websites shut down comment sections and that's why they're
[49:15.720 --> 49:21.440]  moving now, as he said, with the EU and Bilderberg is here this week to discuss the same thing.
[49:21.440 --> 49:26.360]  Having this Internet passport, where you have to get de facto permission from the government
[49:26.360 --> 49:29.960]  to comment on social media, obviously it's not gone that far yet, but that's how they
[49:29.960 --> 49:34.800]  plan to introduce it by saying, oh, it's so convenient, you're using different passwords
[49:34.800 --> 49:36.040]  for each different account.
[49:36.040 --> 49:37.040]  That's so messy.
[49:37.040 --> 49:41.800]  We're going to correlate that into a single Internet passport so we can track everything
[49:41.800 --> 49:42.800]  you do.
[49:42.800 --> 49:43.800]  Which will be biometrically accessed.
[49:43.800 --> 49:44.800]  Yeah.
[49:44.800 --> 49:49.080]  And it's not happening right now, but that's what they want to.
[49:49.080 --> 49:50.240]  That's their admitted plan.
[49:50.240 --> 49:51.800]  That's why they're waging a war on cash.
[49:51.800 --> 49:55.440]  Now, Paul, tell us what else we're going to go to break in a moment.
[49:55.440 --> 49:56.680]  What else is on your front burner?
[49:56.680 --> 49:57.680]  What else you plan to cover?
[49:57.680 --> 49:59.760]  Let me tell you, I'm not, I understand you're speeding by.
[49:59.760 --> 50:02.840]  You want to get somewhere, but man, if you just said pull over, got some of that on
[50:02.840 --> 50:06.520]  tape, an interview or bring the crew back to show, because they'll say those were Germans
[50:06.520 --> 50:07.520]  dealing drugs.
[50:07.520 --> 50:08.520]  Bet your bottom dollar.
[50:08.520 --> 50:11.320]  No, they'll say they're right wing thought criminals.
[50:11.320 --> 50:14.760]  Yeah, we're going to go back to the train station because there's a lot of activity
[50:14.760 --> 50:15.760]  around there.
[50:15.760 --> 50:17.840]  And as the taxi driver said, it's been a huge problem.
[50:17.840 --> 50:21.040]  You know, Rob is not a Mr. Start a Fight guy, but he's tough.
[50:21.040 --> 50:23.840]  So I just want to see one of those punks try to go up and punch him and see him lay down
[50:23.840 --> 50:24.840]  like those Germans have been doing.
[50:24.840 --> 50:27.800]  They're going to get their head torn off.
[50:27.800 --> 50:32.080]  But he said that the police just maintained a constant presence because it's so prolific.
[50:32.080 --> 50:36.120]  The truck dealing that they're just sweeping them up every day, but then releasing them.
[50:36.120 --> 50:38.240]  So we're going to go back there and take a look at what's happening.
[50:38.240 --> 50:39.240]  Sure.
[50:39.240 --> 50:42.880]  That's like that guy that they arrested twice Rob and Stor as they were in Germany.
[50:42.880 --> 50:46.080]  They arrested him a third time, vigilantes come and take him to the police and now they're
[50:46.080 --> 50:47.080]  arresting them.
[50:47.080 --> 50:51.960]  Robbing the store three times in one day.
[50:51.960 --> 50:55.560]  I mean, this government is working against you because it works for foreign globalists.
[50:55.560 --> 50:58.000]  We'll be back with Paul Watson from Dresden, Germany.
[50:58.000 --> 51:01.400]  I'm Alex Jones.

[53:33.080 --> 53:36.560]  Big Berkey water filters are the original and most trusted on the market.
[53:36.560 --> 53:41.560]  The gold standard in water purification and our filters last for years at less than $0.02
[53:41.560 --> 53:42.560]  per gallon.
[53:42.560 --> 53:46.200]  Big Berkey, the one powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.
[53:46.200 --> 53:52.320]  Get your Big Berkey today, call 1-877-99 Berkey or click BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.
[53:52.320 --> 54:18.320]  That's 1-877-99 BERKEY, Big Berkey water filters for the love of clean water.
[54:18.320 --> 54:23.160]  He really took the gloves off with Hillary, blast Hillary and a rigged system.
[54:23.160 --> 54:25.960]  He says he will be America's champion and will not let us down.
[54:25.960 --> 54:26.960]  We'll put America first.
[54:26.960 --> 54:31.240]  He points out he's gotten more votes than any other Republican ever.
[54:31.240 --> 54:37.000]  He points out that he welcomes all the new voters.
[54:37.000 --> 54:39.320]  Points out that he thrives on peace and isn't a warmonger.
[54:39.320 --> 54:41.120]  I mean, this is strong.
[54:41.120 --> 54:45.040]  Paul Watson, describe again where you are for TV viewers and radio listeners and have
[54:45.040 --> 54:50.680]  Rob Dewar Josh Owens pan around for us a little bit as you're there in Dresden, Germany, covering
[54:50.680 --> 54:55.600]  the global secret elite meeting that for 40 years they made fun of people and said didn't
[54:55.600 --> 55:00.800]  exist and that now they admit does exist and runs our new unelected super governments.
[55:00.800 --> 55:03.920]  Oh, by the way, their philosophy is eugenics.
[55:03.920 --> 55:06.120]  Might want to look into that if you're a new listener or viewer.
[55:06.120 --> 55:07.120]  Paul Watson.
[55:07.120 --> 55:12.680]  Yeah, we're here in Dresden, Germany for the 2016 Buildable Conference.
[55:12.680 --> 55:17.800]  They've blocked off the outer perimeter to the Kempinski Hotel here.
[55:17.800 --> 55:21.720]  Obviously our reporters got kicked out of the hotel earlier today, which Rob will tell
[55:21.720 --> 55:22.720]  you about.
[55:22.720 --> 55:23.720]  And we're here.
[55:23.720 --> 55:26.000]  There's not a massive police presence right now.
[55:26.000 --> 55:29.640]  Obviously that's going to increase tomorrow when the attendees start arriving, which is
[55:29.640 --> 55:33.720]  usually around 11 in the morning to 12 midday.
[55:33.720 --> 55:36.400]  So that's when we're expecting the most activity.
[55:36.400 --> 55:38.880]  There'll be a big flurry of activity then.
[55:38.880 --> 55:44.240]  A couple of other things, there's a Bilderberg attendee called Peggy Noonan, who is a writer
[55:44.240 --> 55:47.720]  for the Wall Street Journal, who follows me on Twitter.
[55:47.720 --> 55:51.040]  So she must be a big fan of my YouTube videos.
[55:51.040 --> 55:52.040]  And I've...
[55:52.040 --> 55:54.880]  Now she's a fan of you covering Bilderberg as she's gone before.
[55:54.880 --> 55:55.880]  Yeah.
[55:55.880 --> 55:58.440]  So I asked her out on a date.
[55:58.440 --> 56:00.600]  I asked her to go for a coffee in Dresden.
[56:00.600 --> 56:01.600]  Haven't heard back yet.
[56:01.600 --> 56:04.120]  So I'm looking forward to that if it happens.
[56:04.120 --> 56:08.480]  And the other thing is Hillary Clinton's schedule is clear for the next couple of days.
[56:08.480 --> 56:10.400]  She's visited Bilderberg before.
[56:10.400 --> 56:14.480]  Obviously that's unlikely, but she doesn't have any events over the next couple of days.
[56:14.480 --> 56:16.160]  So we'll watch out for that.
[56:16.160 --> 56:17.440]  All right, Paul.
[56:17.440 --> 56:21.360]  I want to talk to do our job show, and I know you're busy filing reports.
[56:21.360 --> 56:22.360]  Great job.
[56:22.360 --> 56:23.520]  I'll be going back to migrant camps.
[56:23.520 --> 56:26.160]  I hope you're obviously going to fly a drone over those.
[56:26.160 --> 56:29.200]  I want to show these drug dealers and what's going on.
[56:29.200 --> 56:32.040]  And I know at these train stations, folks do try to attack people.
[56:32.040 --> 56:33.040]  So be careful.
[56:33.040 --> 56:36.280]  I know after Bilderberg's over, you guys are going to spend a few days going to Cologne
[56:36.280 --> 56:42.800]  and some other areas to document the no-go zones, but any other points you want to make?
[56:42.800 --> 56:47.200]  Now, just the point on the leak that we got, which is the global tax, that's something
[56:47.200 --> 56:48.520]  they've pushed before.
[56:48.520 --> 56:53.480]  They want either a tax on the oil well, a tax on international financial transactions,
[56:53.480 --> 56:56.200]  or a green tax for flights.
[56:56.200 --> 56:57.200]  And that's kind of hypocritical.
[56:57.200 --> 56:59.200]  And that'll be the start on all carbon.
[56:59.200 --> 57:00.640]  That's the carbon tax.
[57:00.640 --> 57:01.640]  Yeah.
[57:01.640 --> 57:06.120]  Well, they're using massive amounts of energy just staying in this hotel for a few days.
[57:06.120 --> 57:07.960]  And Rob's going to talk more about that.
[57:07.960 --> 57:08.960]  All right, Paul.
[57:08.960 --> 57:09.960]  Great job.
[57:09.960 --> 57:15.120]  You go ahead and hand the baton over literally to do, and then I'll spend a few minutes with
[57:15.120 --> 57:16.440]  Owen's coming back here.
[57:16.440 --> 57:19.280]  Dude, what else has happened in the last 24 hours?
[57:19.280 --> 57:23.360]  Oh, they're switching out right now.
[57:23.360 --> 57:27.480]  But again, this is real media teleprompter free folks.
[57:27.480 --> 57:28.480]  We're not playing games.
[57:28.480 --> 57:29.800]  We're exposing the criminals right now.
[57:29.800 --> 57:33.400]  The Legion of Doom meeting right behind Rob Dover, your TV viewer, your radio listener
[57:33.400 --> 57:37.720]  infowars.com, Ford's last show to find the free feeds, and find the limited edition.
[57:37.720 --> 57:40.640]  When these sell out, we're going to have a new edition of the Hillary for President shirt
[57:40.640 --> 57:41.640]  that I just ordered today.
[57:41.640 --> 57:46.640]  So these will sell out in the next few weeks, Hillary for President 2016, infowarsstore.com.
[57:46.640 --> 57:48.280]  Your purchase helps support the broadcast.
[57:48.280 --> 57:50.200]  We're going to come back with more with you, dude.
[57:50.200 --> 57:52.200]  But what else has happened in the last 24?
[57:52.200 --> 57:56.840]  Well, last night when we got back to our hotel, we had this letter on the letterhead
[57:56.840 --> 57:58.400]  of the hotel, which I do have in my possession.
[57:58.400 --> 58:00.400]  Oh, I forgot about that being thrown out.
[58:00.400 --> 58:01.400]  Yes.
[58:01.400 --> 58:02.400]  Yeah, exactly.
[58:02.400 --> 58:03.880]  You have to be out by noon.
[58:03.880 --> 58:06.760]  There's no, you cannot stay any time past noon.
[58:06.760 --> 58:09.800]  And if you don't get your car out of the garage by noon, we're going to hold on to it.
[58:09.800 --> 58:12.320]  So they're basically said they're going to steal your car and there's nothing you can
[58:12.320 --> 58:16.480]  do about it because the lovely globalists are coming and nothing can stay in their way.
[58:16.480 --> 58:19.800]  And the taxpayers are paying for the military to be there.
[58:19.800 --> 58:20.800]  And let's send the camera down.
[58:20.800 --> 58:24.680]  You got to walk up to the, we come back in 60 seconds, 70, we got to walk over and talk
[58:24.680 --> 58:25.680]  to the police at the checkpoint.
[58:25.680 --> 58:30.560]  Now I know they're German police, very polite to you mess with them and then you know what
[58:30.560 --> 58:33.720]  happened, but we're going to find out what's going on.
[58:33.720 --> 58:36.720]  Of course, we had to teach the old Germans a little lesson, didn't we?
[58:36.720 --> 58:37.720]  We'll be right back.
[58:37.720 --> 58:38.720]  Stay with us.

[59:53.680 --> 01:00:03.760]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:10.320]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:13.240]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:14.240]  All right.
[01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:18.640]  We're evil Americans concerned about the EU signing secret treaties with the NAU and
[01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:22.520]  criminals in our country working with European criminals to overthrow our governments, destroy
[01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:25.480]  our free speech, open our borders up and make us pay for everybody.
[01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:29.960]  We're being conquered, 21st century warfare, how dare us prove secret meetings are going
[01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:35.040]  on, how dare us do our job and force the mainstream media to do it and how dare Rob do in Germany
[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:37.400]  and Dresden is about to walk up and talk to the police.
[01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:38.400]  Rob do.
[01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:39.400]  Now go ahead and describe what's behind you.
[01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:40.400]  You got the police there.
[01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:41.880]  Go ahead and go try to talk to them.
[01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:42.880]  All right.
[01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:48.520]  So what we're at right now, there's concrete barriers, rod iron gates, probably 20 to 30
[01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:51.560]  policemen around this area.
[01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:53.800]  And it looks like the police are coming down the street now.
[01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:57.000]  It might be for some running, I think there's a running event going on.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.680]  But Alex, this morning when I was talking to the security and the people behind the
[01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:05.880]  counter at the desk, none of them would say Bilderberg.
[01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:08.400]  And I even asked, I said, is it because of the Bilderberg events that were getting kicked
[01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:09.400]  out?
[01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:10.400]  I don't know, sir.
[01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:11.400]  I don't know, sir.
[01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:12.400]  I know nothing.
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:13.400]  I know nothing.
[01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:14.400]  So let me ask these two gentlemen.
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:15.400]  Excuse me.
[01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:16.400]  Excuse me.
[01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:17.400]  Hey.
[01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:18.400]  No.
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:19.400]  No one to talk.
[01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:20.900]  We can't even ask you a question.
[01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:21.900]  You're not even human.
[01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:22.900]  Do you have a PIO?
[01:01:22.900 --> 01:01:23.900]  Public information officer?
[01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:24.900]  Bilderberg doesn't exist.
[01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:25.900]  No one?
[01:01:25.900 --> 01:01:27.960]  Notice it doesn't exist still for those folks.
[01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:30.280]  Hey, Deb, they don't want to talk to us.
[01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:33.160]  There's actually a race going on right now in the town of Dresden.
[01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:35.440]  Just like Hillary, stealing the delegates doesn't count.
[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:36.440]  Look at this.
[01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:39.600]  These people have no idea what's going on next to them.
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:42.680]  Just as we were watching tours going by this morning, as a tour would come by, they're
[01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:44.880]  locking everything down and said, hey, do you know what's going on?
[01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:48.080]  No, I have no idea that they had no idea what the security was here.
[01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:49.080]  Well, it's a Bilderberg meeting.
[01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:50.080]  Oh, what's that?
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:51.080]  I need to go look it up.
[01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:57.120]  This is a secret meeting of your leaders who are creating an unelected combine to dictate
[01:01:57.120 --> 01:01:58.240]  your future.
[01:01:58.240 --> 01:01:59.680]  And you have no say in it, no matter what.
[01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:04.040]  These people, and you've got these people running by during all this madness.
[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:06.560]  It's totally crazy what's going on here in Dresden.
[01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:09.440]  Well, the German people are great folks, and they're really awake, I've noticed, but their
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:12.720]  governments are really evil, and it's like our government's evil.
[01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:15.720]  What happens in America gets in a war like Germany did, and tens of millions of us die
[01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:18.920]  because we didn't do enough to stop what's coming down.
[01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:19.920]  What do you make?
[01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:20.920]  I don't know if you've heard this.
[01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:24.600]  They admit in even New York Daily News that a secret committee met with the Associated
[01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:29.680]  Press on Monday and told them the results of the election via the superdelegates.
[01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:30.680]  That's voter news services.
[01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:34.000]  That's how they've stolen elections before, but now it's being forced out in the open,
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.480]  and the media is acting like it's normal, dude.
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:42.320]  Well, I was looking at the return results, and I think it was Montana, I'm not sure,
[01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:46.520]  where Bernie Sanders won the popular vote, and he's still got less delegates.
[01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:51.000]  So, once again, I've pointed this out three or four times.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.000]  It's just ridiculous.
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:56.720]  At any time, he won by like eight or nine percent.
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:03:00.160]  He should have had at least three more delegates than Hillary Clinton, but he had one less
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:01.160]  than she did.
[01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:02.680]  So, that's how it's going.
[01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:04.800]  Bernie supporters, that's what they're doing to you.
[01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:05.800]  They're taking your dreams.
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:09.920]  They're taking basically exactly what happened to the Ron Paul movement, although they had
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:15.240]  so many people in that race in 2008, 2012, Ron Paul was unable to maintain momentum,
[01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:16.800]  but here it was just a two-person race.
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:20.240]  I think if Ron Paul would have been going against Mitt Romney or John McCain, it would
[01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:23.080]  have been a totally different story if it had just been one-on-one.
[01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:26.320]  But now, but people got to see, that's what would have happened to Ron Paul.
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:27.800]  They would have been stealing delegates.
[01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:30.320]  They'd have been stealing the election just by a few percentage points, because that's
[01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:31.320]  how they manipulated it.
[01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:34.920]  But yeah, the fact that they knew what the results were going to be with these super
[01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:37.040]  delegates and they just, people just let it go.
[01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:39.320]  It's open stolen election out in the open.
[01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:40.320]  Oh, let's go over here.
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:41.320]  The cops talking to these people.
[01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:43.320]  He's talking to them like they're here and run over there.
[01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:45.000]  He's going to run off.
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.000]  Talk over there, watch.
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.000]  He'll run off.
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.000]  And just say, Hey, who's meeting inside?
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.000]  What is this meeting?
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.880]  So you want to talk to these guys, but you won't talk to me?
[01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:54.000]  You don't want to talk with me because I'm an evil American.
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.000]  Here's the press.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.000]  You can laugh, but I said evil Americans.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.000]  So you don't think I'm an evil American.
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.000]  You need to look up the Builderberg.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000]  You do look like the dude, though, from Big Lebowski.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.000]  I do.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.000]  Yeah, ask those folks what he said.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.000]  Ask the old folks.
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.000]  What's that?
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.000]  Look, it's Builderberg.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:14.960]  Okay, Builderberg is a meeting of 200 of the most powerful people in the world.
[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:19.120]  In Western Europe, Canada, and the United States that get together, well, so the king
[01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:21.360]  of the Netherlands is going to be here.
[01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:24.080]  Angela Merkel's ministers are going to be here.
[01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:29.280]  There's no, we don't know if the president is coming, but Hillary, well, yeah, Obama's
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:31.440]  probably not going to come, but Hillary Clinton might.
[01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:32.440]  She might show up.
[01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:35.920]  She went to a meeting in 2008 when they were going to decide whether it was going to be
[01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:38.560]  Obama or Clinton, but they meet here.
[01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:40.560]  And when you talked to, they won't even say Builderberg.
[01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:41.560]  He won't say Builderberg.
[01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:44.360]  He might have, but the people inside will not say Builderberg.
[01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:45.360]  They're afraid.
[01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:46.800]  And so they're having this meeting in secret.
[01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:50.640]  And these are Germans, Austrians, Polish, yeah, it's a secret meeting.
[01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:54.800]  They won't talk that there will be, you notice there's only alternative media here tomorrow.
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:55.800]  They're all going to be coming in.
[01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:56.800]  Oh, this guy's going behind the curtain.
[01:04:56.800 --> 01:04:57.800]  Stay there, dude.
[01:04:57.800 --> 01:04:59.800]  I'm going to come back to you and Alex Nim and stay with us.
[01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:04.280]  It was Thomas Jefferson who once said that our country is now taking so steady, of course,
[01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:09.120]  as to show by what rodeo will pass to destruction to wit by consolidation of power first and
[01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:10.120]  then corruption.
[01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:11.840]  It's necessary consequence.
[01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:14.920]  Politician was warning us about the global elite, the one percent of the one percent
[01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:18.920]  consolidating the world's wealth and subverting the people's voice in government.
[01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:20.600]  Unfortunately, we didn't heed his advice.
[01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:24.680]  We now live in a neo-futalistic society in which we're treated as indentured servants
[01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:27.440]  who only exist to serve the needs of the establishment.
[01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:30.720]  Political office no longer represents the voice of the people, but rather the initiation
[01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:34.840]  process politicians go through to gain acceptance into the aristocracy.
[01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:38.320]  Simply put, we the people are responsible for civilization and culture, yet we're suppressed
[01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:41.880]  by a tiny elite who have organized into criminal gangs that operate governments around the
[01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:42.880]  world.
[01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:46.960]  We falsely believe that everything is simply black and white, one extreme against the other,
[01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:50.720]  conservative versus liberal, but things will change once more of us realize this truth.
[01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:54.920]  As Thomas Jefferson also said, enlighten the people generally, and tyranny and oppressions
[01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:58.160]  of the body and mind will vanish like evil spirits at the dawn of day.
[01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:00.600]  This is Kit Daniels with InfoWars.com.
[01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:01.760]  Hey, everyone.
[01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:05.480]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of the Bright Side, and as many of you know, I'm on a mission
[01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:07.760]  to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:09.840]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:14.640]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in healthcare, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in
[01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:20.120]  this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:23.400]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone
[01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:26.520]  knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:29.360]  If you're dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain your

[01:07:56.920 --> 01:08:10.920]  He's the T-Rex of Political Talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:23.320]  Alex Newman is an educator, and he writes for the New American Magazine, and he has dug
[01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:30.240]  through Obama's Rural Communities Plan, also the Rewilding Plan, and then now they have
[01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:38.440]  this Diversification Plan saying that money and wealth and also scientific know-how is
[01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:40.680]  fleeing to the suburbs of the countryside.
[01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:41.680]  Absolutely.
[01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:46.560]  You want to live in cities where they charge you $5,000 a month for a 250-square-foot apartment?
[01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:47.720]  That's the model.
[01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:49.880]  You don't get something smaller and then get a value.
[01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:50.880]  They screw you.
[01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:53.640]  It's how to get all your money.
[01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:55.120]  They want 90% tax.
[01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:56.680]  That's Agenda 21.
[01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:58.080]  That's what the robber barons want.
[01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:00.640]  They exempt themselves from the taxes.
[01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:06.960]  I have articles here today where McDonald's globally is getting countries to exempt it
[01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:12.000]  from taxes, and here's the issue.
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:15.880]  Everybody else that's in the country, their businesses don't.
[01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:17.680]  That's what the New World Order is.
[01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:22.440]  They write all these rules and regulations to put us in flypaper, and they're just flying
[01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:27.200]  around above us, and it's not just that.
[01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:29.160]  It's criminal laws they exempt themselves from.
[01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:33.920]  This is what world government is, so he's got a new article out on it, but there it
[01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:37.040]  is out of the Financial Times of London.
[01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:44.920]  Brussels serves up McDonald's secret X changes with Grand Duchy to get tax breaks nobody
[01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:48.000]  else in the country gets to bring in their crap.
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.720]  How about more taxes on your garbage food?
[01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:53.640]  That's social engineering, so I don't want that, but I'm saying instead of you getting
[01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:56.760]  always the exemptions, and then wondering why the place with the great hamburger next
[01:09:56.760 --> 01:09:58.960]  door is $4 more.
[01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:02.160]  It's because they've got to pay all the taxes, the Obamacare, and the rest of it.
[01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:05.560]  So we're going to go to Alex Newman in a moment, his story.
[01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:09.480]  You and Adopts Education Plan to Inductriate Children in Globalism.
[01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:11.680]  That's one article, and then we've got another one.
[01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:17.360]  The reason I wanted to get him on is about the situation with the zoning, if you guys
[01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:18.360]  can print me that article.
[01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:21.320]  We're, oh, we're going to not make the countryside racist.
[01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:24.120]  That's like, oh, Germany, a town has 102 residents.
[01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:28.360]  They bring in 700, quote, Syrians who are really just invading from all over the world
[01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:31.800]  into Syria, into Turkey.
[01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:33.440]  I mean, it is just mind-blowing.
[01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:44.920]  Imagine 700 people in your town of 100, and you're supposed to pay for everything.
[01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:48.520]  So we're going to be talking to him while we talk to Rob Do and crew who are on the
[01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:52.160]  ground in Dresden, Germany, and we're just educating Germans who are walking up, talking
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:53.680]  to the police saying, what is this?
[01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:54.680]  And they wouldn't tell them.
[01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:58.000]  So the man says, yeah, they won't tell us, you know, we're here.
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:59.000]  What is it?
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.800]  He goes, it's a secret global government conference with world leaders.
[01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:03.120]  And the guy's like, what?
[01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:06.160]  So let's go back to Rob Do to put bookends on that and then ride shotgun with us to the
[01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:07.160]  bottom of the hour.
[01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:09.360]  Dude, this is just getting crazy, isn't it?
[01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:10.360]  Yeah.
[01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:15.440]  And that couple, that older couple, they were totally freaked out by what I told them.
[01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:16.680]  I wish we hadn't gone to break.
[01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:19.360]  I wish we would have skipped the break right then because I was sitting there educating
[01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:21.320]  him, just going, this is what it is.
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:24.080]  These are the people, because I'm like, you know, 200 of the most powerful people.
[01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:25.080]  Oh, who are they?
[01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:30.800]  Oh, the king of the Netherlands, the head of Google, you know, the editors at Bloomberg
[01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:37.560]  and the Economist and also the Peter Thiel, who's a big investment banker, just started
[01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:42.040]  naming off all these people that are coming here to basically dictate your future.
[01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:45.960]  And then I said that these people are total hypocrites inside in the rooms.
[01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:47.520]  We couldn't get our air conditioning to work.
[01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:48.520]  Okay.
[01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:49.520]  For two days.
[01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:50.520]  Luckily, it's nice.
[01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:52.080]  We just opened the windows.
[01:11:52.080 --> 01:12:00.780]  They built a giant stage with a plastic frame on top, like a giant tent with its dome looking
[01:12:00.780 --> 01:12:04.600]  and they're pumping in air conditioning into this dome because it's hot because the sun's
[01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:05.600]  hitting it.
[01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:06.600]  It's inside the courtyard.
[01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:10.000]  You can't see it from here, but we shot a video on it this morning, caught at the location
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:13.400]  of the Bilderberg foam party found because it looked like they have these hoses and they're
[01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:17.200]  going to have like pump and foam at some point and run around and jiggle with each other
[01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:19.200]  or something disgusting like that.
[01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:24.280]  But they have giant vents and they're pumping in air conditioning into this thing while
[01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:27.440]  they're telling you, you can't have air conditioning and people don't get that.
[01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:31.120]  And it's really, it's just, they're total hypocrites and the guy's like, yeah, you're
[01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:32.120]  right.
[01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:33.120]  You're right.
[01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:34.120]  We'll check it out.
[01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:35.120]  And he asked how to spell it.
[01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:36.480]  And then him and his wife walked off to enjoy their night.
[01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:38.400]  But you know, they're walking around here.
[01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:39.400]  They're wondering what's going on.
[01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:41.400]  Why they have these concrete pylons.
[01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:46.600]  Why do they have bomb sniffing dogs to two cars over here with bomb sniffing dogs that
[01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:47.600]  they've been bringing up.
[01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:51.120]  Well, Rob, I mean, I saw I'm talking to the cop and they came over and said, I don't know
[01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:53.200]  what this is that the cop hadn't told him.
[01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:56.680]  Did you get a chance to ask him what the cops told him it was?
[01:12:56.680 --> 01:13:00.680]  No, they, he was asking him what it was and they said it was an event.
[01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:02.440]  They don't ever say what it is.
[01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:06.720]  And it's just like what happened with, with us inside and talking to the security outside.
[01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:10.160]  So they have Bilderberg security, they have the red lanyards and they're walking around.
[01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:11.160]  They said, you got to move your car.
[01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:12.320]  And I said, why don't we have to move our car?
[01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:13.320]  What's going on?
[01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:15.440]  Oh, nothing, nothing, nothing's going on.
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:16.840]  Why do I have to move my car?
[01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:18.360]  You know, what's the big deal?
[01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:21.440]  So it's just, we're not going to tell you what's going on.
[01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:24.840]  Don't say the words builder and Berg together because we'll totally freak out.
[01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:30.480]  The staff had a just conniption fit this morning when three other reporters, Luke and Dan Dix
[01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:32.640]  and Lauren Southern stayed in their rooms.
[01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:36.680]  They kind of just stayed in their rooms after the noon o'clock hour.
[01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:39.840]  So we filmed them coming out and, you know, they were just, these people were totally
[01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:40.840]  freaking out.
[01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:43.120]  They don't want to say anything because I guess they're afraid to lose their job because,
[01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:47.600]  you know, once you lose your job anywhere in, in, in, you know, Europe or the United
[01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:50.160]  States, well, you might not find another one.
[01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:53.080]  And then you're going to be destitute like those other people out there, you know, the
[01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:56.240]  poor and destitute of the world.
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:14:00.240]  So you are, your only choice is to submit to these demons that are coming here and want
[01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:03.480]  to rule us like gods.
[01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:09.920]  I've got two new articles, Swedish police, excuse migrant rate, blame Nordic alcohol
[01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:11.320]  culture and ignorance.
[01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:13.320]  That's what I was being mentioned earlier.
[01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:14.320]  That's from Breitbart.com.
[01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:18.560]  There's another one, Obama making bid to diversify wealthy neighborhoods, but you read deeper.
[01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:23.920]  That is to bring in agenda 21 in the countryside and our guest has written an article about
[01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:24.920]  that.
[01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:28.280]  I want to bring him in about both these issues and tie it all together with Alex Newman of
[01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:29.280]  the new American.com.
[01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:33.520]  I tell you, Alex, to actually see the shadow government being exposed.
[01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:37.240]  This is a huge victory to see mainstream news have to report there indeed in their making
[01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:38.240]  policy.
[01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:41.440]  This is a big victory, but now we've got to go the rest of the way, give a short take
[01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:44.880]  on the leaked agenda that we have exclusively gotten for global taxes.
[01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:47.240]  We know that's already on the agenda, but we've confirmed it.
[01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:51.880]  We've got taxes to track the web, internet censorship and do you stay with us and pop
[01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:52.880]  it anytime you'd like.
[01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:57.080]  But Alex, just amazing to see their agenda coming from this little secret meeting every
[01:14:57.080 --> 01:15:02.240]  year and then whatever they want to do from our sources ends up being the new policy just
[01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:03.240]  within a few weeks.
[01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:05.680]  Thanks for having me, Alex.
[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:09.160]  It really is amazing how everything is coming out into the open now.
[01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:11.240]  You guys just covered your Bilderberg has been awesome.
[01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:16.280]  I actually met some of your guys in Copenhagen covering Bilderberg a few years ago and great
[01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:20.200]  work you guys are doing and it's amazing to see how the Bilderberg is out in the open
[01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:21.200]  now.
[01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:25.320]  I did a quick search this morning for news on Bilderberg and it's in all the big newspapers
[01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:29.000]  and now they're talking about it, it's exposed and it's thanks to the work of the alternative
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:34.880]  media, people like you guys who are really out there doing the job that the media should
[01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:37.880]  have been doing and that you guys have been doing for many years.
[01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:43.120]  It's amazing to see, keep up the good work and the agenda is really troubling now that
[01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:47.120]  it's coming out with the global taxes, they've been on this mission for a long time, but
[01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:51.480]  now as people are waking up, now as the agenda comes out into the open, now is the time for
[01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:55.520]  humanity to stand up and say, no, we're not going to pay global taxes, no, we're not going
[01:15:55.520 --> 01:16:00.360]  to allow you to brainwash our children in government schools with the UN, globalism
[01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:01.360]  and spirituality.
[01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:05.920]  This is the kind of stuff they're talking about now, so great work and let's keep it
[01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:07.920]  up because we can still definitely learn it.
[01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:08.920]  Sure, and I'm going to be clear.
[01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:10.400]  I'm not trying to say good work to you, good work to me or anything.
[01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:12.680]  I'm saying we're having success in the war.
[01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:15.760]  We're identifying these whole shadow apparatus.
[01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:21.000]  They fought so hard to keep it secret because it can't continue on having a secret dictatorial
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:22.880]  planetary program forever.
[01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:25.080]  We're going to have a debate about this.
[01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:29.680]  That's right and we're now coming in the time when this is going to be out in the open.
[01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:32.640]  The tyranny could only be implemented under the radar for so long.
[01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:33.880]  Now it's starting to hit home.
[01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:38.400]  Now you're getting millions of third world immigrants coming in under the guise of refugees.
[01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:43.040]  Now they're cranking down the screws with the global taxes and the carbon taxes and
[01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:47.960]  shutting down the businesses and diversifying the neighborhoods and putting the globalism
[01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:49.600]  into the schools openly.
[01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:55.120]  So now that this is out in the open, you really have to be a zombie to not understand what's
[01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:56.120]  happening.
[01:16:56.120 --> 01:17:00.160]  So now is when, how do they say now is crunch time, right?
[01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:01.640]  Now we really need to get busy.
[01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:03.320]  Now everybody can see what's happening.
[01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:05.000]  They can't conceal it anymore.
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:06.000]  So now is the opportunity.
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:10.840]  Exactly, let's be clear, when they send, these are real stories, a town of 700 Germans,
[01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:11.840]  they send 3,000.
[01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:19.440]  There's a metric I've noticed, 700 Germans, 3,000 invaders, okay, a town of 102, we send
[01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:20.680]  in 700.
[01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:25.920]  This is to erase those groups, take them over and create an enclave that state funded where
[01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:27.680]  they then start pumping in more refugees.
[01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:30.480]  And I've noticed here, it's in the hundreds of thousands, they say it's in the thousands.
[01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:31.640]  This is the hundreds of thousands.
[01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:34.200]  Just like Europe said it was in the hundreds of thousands, it was millions.
[01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:38.760]  And they are sitting in the small towns of a few hundred, they'll send 100 Syrian refugees.
[01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:43.280]  They're taking over, they're setting up the breakup of the country.
[01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:47.600]  Alex, get into this whole rewilding after the break, also how they're trying to diversify
[01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:51.720]  the neighborhoods, what's behind that, but first, Rob, do your questions or comments
[01:17:51.720 --> 01:17:54.000]  for Alex Newman of the New American Magazine.
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:58.960]  Well, I'll just tell it like it is, Alex, that we, we talked to this guy, Muhammad,
[01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:04.160]  who said basically they're given free housing and food and they're giving him spending money
[01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:05.560]  and they're told they can't do anything else.
[01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:08.200]  They have to sit around and do nothing.
[01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:09.200]  So you're just...
[01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:12.360]  They've got to learn to be words of the state, they're being fashioned and in a few years
[01:18:12.360 --> 01:18:15.680]  they'll become police officers after they've gone through the courses.
[01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:18.600]  Well either that or they're going to become jihadis because they're sitting around and
[01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:20.920]  they don't like the looks they're getting from the German people.
[01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:23.920]  They don't like how they're being treated by, by the people in the area.
[01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:27.040]  So they're getting resentment and so that's just building inside of them.
[01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:30.200]  And I could feel it the way he was talking, he's like, they look at me funny.
[01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:33.640]  And then when I walked over there to talk to him, he was with a group of five other guys.
[01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:35.160]  They all looked at me like they wanted to kill me.
[01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:39.080]  They were like, I mean, they were pissed off and they, they didn't want to talk to me
[01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:40.080]  at all.
[01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:41.080]  Only one guy did.
[01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:42.080]  And, but he gave me that perspective.
[01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:43.080]  Of course he's like, I stay here.
[01:18:43.080 --> 01:18:44.080]  Everyone hate me.
[01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:45.080]  It's mine now.
[01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:46.080]  Free stuff.
[01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:47.080]  Exactly.
[01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:48.080]  Oh yeah.
[01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:49.080]  He wasn't going to leave.
[01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:50.080]  So they're going to stay here for the free stuff.
[01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:51.080]  But then what's going to happen after that?
[01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:55.400]  What's going to happen after one year or two years that he's in, inside Germany and, and
[01:18:55.400 --> 01:18:59.000]  getting nothing or getting all this stuff and having to do for it?
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:00.000]  That's right.
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:01.000]  That's right.
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:02.000]  Rob do stay there.
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:03.000]  I want to come back.
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:06.120]  I mean, we're talking to Alex Newman here in the U S. I'm in the U S. Alex going out
[01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:07.440]  to break in one minute.
[01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:08.760]  What comes next after this?
[01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:11.760]  I mean, how does the political class think they're going to get away with this?
[01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:14.880]  Well, you know, it's funny, you guys are at Bilderberg right now.
[01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:19.160]  They told us Peter Sutherland, the Goldman Sachs guy, member of the Bilderberg steering
[01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:20.520]  committee for quite some time.
[01:19:20.520 --> 01:19:23.480]  Now he's the UN czar for mass migration.
[01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:24.840]  And he told us what's going on here.
[01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:28.840]  He said, we have to get rid of these old shibbolets, this national sovereignty, these borders.
[01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:30.920]  We're all just one big human family.
[01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:31.920]  So that's the plan.
[01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:32.920]  That's what they think they're going to do.
[01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:36.800]  They're going to flood the countries with people who have no conception of Western civilization
[01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:40.320]  because Western civilization is not compatible with globalism.
[01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:43.320]  And you know, that's the agenda.
[01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:46.960]  Now I'm going to get Josh Owens on here in a moment and then to get Paul Watson to pop
[01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:49.520]  back in with this take from Dresden, our three reporters there.
[01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:53.600]  But I don't see their whole project going too well, Alex Newman.
[01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:59.440]  I mean, if it's criminal, if it's illegitimate, if the EU never got voted on for these countries
[01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:00.440]  to join it.
[01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:05.640]  And the public learns about that, the numbers in the polls like the British exit, the Brexit,
[01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:07.160]  only turns against the New World Order.
[01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:08.720]  I mean, aren't they in crisis?
[01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:12.800]  They always wanted to organize financial crisis in their own documents to bring in more globalism,
[01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:15.360]  more centralization, more power, more scarcity.
[01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:17.360]  So we're poor with their thumb on us.
[01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:21.680]  But instead, people now know it's the globalist offering this, whether it's Latin America
[01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:27.680]  or Europe or Africa or Asia, people are on fire with this awakening.
[01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:28.680]  It's true.
[01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:32.520]  And we need to be there and keep providing the tools and the education that people need.
[01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:33.520]  But you're right.
[01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:34.520]  This is out in the open now.
[01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:35.520]  They're telling us what they're doing.
[01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:39.160]  And so now we have a role to come in and say, hey, we've been looking at this for years,
[01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:40.400]  for decades.
[01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:41.400]  This is what's going on.
[01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:44.080]  This is how we need to fight it and get involved with us.
[01:20:44.080 --> 01:20:45.360]  Do you want your country destroyed?
[01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:46.840]  Do you want your liberty taken away?
[01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:48.040]  Do you want your children brainwashed?
[01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:51.800]  And the answer for a regular person is absolutely not.
[01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:54.040]  So now, you know, we've been in this fight for so long.
[01:20:54.040 --> 01:20:58.360]  Now it's time for people all over the world to see what's going on and wake up and put
[01:20:58.360 --> 01:20:59.360]  us off to it.
[01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:00.360]  Absolutely.
[01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:01.920]  We're about to go to Josh Owens here.
[01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:03.760]  Again, this is the future of media.
[01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:05.400]  This is teleprompter free.
[01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:06.560]  This is unscripted.
[01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:08.640]  This is reality based.
[01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:11.600]  Just analysis of common sense history.
[01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:17.320]  And let's go to Josh Owens, Josh, just watching this unfold, being in Germany now three days.
[01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:19.080]  What is it like to actually witness this for yourself?
[01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:22.000]  I mean, you've seen a lot in your years here at InfoWars.
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:23.000]  Yeah.
[01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:26.600]  Well, just seeing the first hand perspective is pretty, it's pretty unbelievable.
[01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:28.800]  I was expecting it when we came here.
[01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:31.200]  I was expecting to get some confrontations with people.
[01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:34.640]  I was expecting some people to be unhappy, especially that we were filming them because
[01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:36.680]  apparently that's the worst thing in the world.
[01:21:36.680 --> 01:21:40.840]  But to actually see it in person, and you're right, I've seen a lot of things.
[01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:42.480]  We've been at Bundy Ranch.
[01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:48.000]  We were threatened at the NSA, countless things, Ferguson.
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:53.560]  So it's not like the U.S. is exempt and we see the things happening in the U.S. now.
[01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:59.520]  But when you're out at these migrant camps and all you're doing is talking to someone
[01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:05.720]  and this whole group of self-appointed blue shirt security guys come and run towards you
[01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:06.720]  and start screaming at you.
[01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:10.440]  And by the way, their body language was very, very aggressive and intimidating.
[01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:11.440]  Absolutely.
[01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:13.520]  And that's the thing about being here in person.
[01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:16.080]  It doesn't convey always in video.
[01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:21.080]  And like I said a couple of days ago on the show, I wish that I had unplugged dude's mic
[01:22:21.080 --> 01:22:24.760]  so you could hear the guy that was beside me because he was threatening me, telling
[01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:26.920]  me that he was going to delete the footage.
[01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:30.840]  I mean, this guy acted like he had more power than the thugs at the NSA when they screamed
[01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:31.840]  at us.
[01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:33.320]  It's completely ridiculous.
[01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:34.520]  These people are entitled.
[01:22:34.520 --> 01:22:36.520]  They think that they have the right to threaten people.
[01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:38.560]  Yeah, you're at the gate to their immigrant facility.
[01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:41.800]  They're the last wave of illegals that the government's put in charge.
[01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:45.600]  And you know, you got a right to defend yourself when they put their hands on you, sure that
[01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:49.160]  they had a big, strong, right hook right to the side of the head.
[01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:50.160]  Exactly.
[01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:55.120]  We were on a public street, we were on a public street and we had this city official come
[01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:57.840]  up and say, well, we just don't want them to feel threatened.
[01:22:57.840 --> 01:22:59.320]  We don't want them to feel harassed.
[01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:04.040]  But it's okay if they go in train stations and rape women and sell drugs.
[01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:08.600]  Yeah, it's okay if they do that and come to our countries and do that.
[01:23:08.600 --> 01:23:12.040]  Because it's about the government breaking the Germans who already pay the most taxes
[01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:17.080]  in the world and keep living under it and at the highest production rates in the world.
[01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:18.080]  And it's not enough.
[01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:20.320]  The government taught them not to have kids and die.
[01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:23.480]  But even as it strangles them and uses them to take over the world and they bring in
[01:23:23.480 --> 01:23:26.840]  their replacements that are literally were diapers, I mean, this is what we're talking
[01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:27.840]  about.
[01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:30.600]  You're supposed to just bow down to them as you're being strangled.
[01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:31.600]  Exactly.
[01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:33.800]  And that's what's going to happen in this building back here.
[01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:37.280]  You're going to have politicians, policymakers, big businesses.
[01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:38.720]  That's what they're going to be talking about.
[01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:42.480]  They're going to be talking about how to continue this migrant invasion, how to carry it over
[01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:48.000]  to the U.S. because Europe is collapsing with the migrants everywhere, flooding the streets
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:49.000]  right now.
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:50.000]  We're in Dresden.
[01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:51.000]  So it's not as bad here.
[01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:54.240]  It's more of a conservative area.
[01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:59.040]  But in Munich, in Cologne, we see the news stories.
[01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:02.400]  We see the women getting raped by groups of people.
[01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:05.320]  We see people getting beaten in the streets.
[01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:08.680]  It's not, it's not, we can't debate it because we see that it's happening.
[01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:13.320]  People see, we live in a time period now where all people have to do is hold this up and film
[01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:14.520]  what's going on.
[01:24:14.520 --> 01:24:15.720]  And so we see it firsthand.
[01:24:15.720 --> 01:24:18.360]  We might not be there, but we see what's happening.
[01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:19.360]  And it's,
[01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:20.360]  That's right.
[01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:22.920]  And you're there documenting it and people can get your video reports unfiltered right
[01:24:22.920 --> 01:24:27.760]  there at infowars.com, prisonplanet.com and on the nightly news, 7 o'clock central weeknights
[01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:32.120]  of course here with info wars live 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. central standard time.
[01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:34.920]  I'm going to come back to Watson briefly here at the end of the break, but I want to go
[01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:38.320]  back to Alex Newman now for the balance of the time, but try to get Watson set up here
[01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:41.000]  in a few minutes to pop in with some final comments.
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:44.160]  Going back to Alex Newman, the New American magazine, let's get into their agenda.
[01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:47.200]  Let's get into this movement you've written about where they're going to spend tens of
[01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:52.240]  billions a year and their billing is making the suburbs not be racist or rich neighborhoods
[01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:53.240]  not be racist.
[01:24:53.240 --> 01:24:58.560]  But when you really read, it's about setting up federal nodes in the rural areas.
[01:24:58.560 --> 01:24:59.560]  It is.
[01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:03.000]  You know, I think there's a few components to this agenda.
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:08.440]  One of the key ones is essentially ignoring state borders, ignoring local government,
[01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:12.720]  city government, county government, usurping control of those and turning it into just
[01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:15.000]  an apparatus of the federal government.
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:16.160]  That's what's happening here.
[01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:21.000]  They're using these multi-billion dollar slush funds that, you know, they have these huge
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:25.120]  pots of money that the GOP Congress keeps handing over to the Obama administration.
[01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:28.760]  And what they do is they say, all right, you local governments, you guys are taking money
[01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:29.760]  from us.
[01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:31.240]  So now you need to submit to our regulation.
[01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:32.240]  Oh, I forgot.
[01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:33.600]  That's your other article yesterday.
[01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:34.600]  That's right.
[01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:38.080]  The GOP even has given Obama more money than he wanted for this.
[01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:42.680]  So they're helping run the whole thing to pay to bring immigrants, illegals, poor people,
[01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:46.720]  prisoners, criminals into these 10-story buildings they're building outside Austin
[01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:52.400]  and other areas in like, in like, I mean, you name it, I forget the town, Elgin.
[01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:55.960]  And then they admit it's a judge 21, you in, and they just bring in prisoners and criminals
[01:25:55.960 --> 01:25:59.160]  and people right into the middle of your little town and just take over.
[01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:00.160]  Sorry.
[01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:01.160]  That's right.
[01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:02.160]  And that's exactly what they have planned.
[01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:03.160]  They're collecting all this data.
[01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:07.160]  They're going to look at the racial makeup, the income makeup of every neighborhood, every
[01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:08.640]  town, every zip code.
[01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:12.120]  And if there's not enough, you know, a certain race in this community, they're going to
[01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:13.120]  move some in.
[01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:16.320]  If there's not enough poor people in this wealthy middle-class community, we're going
[01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:18.120]  to build some housing projects there.
[01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:21.640]  We're going to have to rezone everything to conform with these international standards
[01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:23.480]  that are coming down the pipe.
[01:26:23.480 --> 01:26:26.840]  And you know, it's very clear that this is not just a national agenda.
[01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:28.360]  This is not just the Obama administration.
[01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:32.960]  This is the implementation of international agreements, many of which of course the Senate
[01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:34.480]  has not even ratified.
[01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:36.040]  But you know, it's out in the open now.
[01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:37.040]  It's in your face.
[01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:40.920]  They are implementing these international agreements, sustainable development, Agenda
[01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:41.920]  21.
[01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:46.360]  This is the UN Agenda 2030 where they're basically going to just come out in the open with the
[01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:47.360]  global governance.
[01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:48.880]  They're going to take over education.
[01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:49.880]  They want health care.
[01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:51.920]  They want, you know, housing policy.
[01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:53.000]  They want the oceans.
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:54.440]  They want natural resources.
[01:26:54.440 --> 01:26:56.440]  They want national income redistribution.
[01:26:56.440 --> 01:26:58.920]  They want international wealth redistribution.
[01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:00.760]  They want common ownership of all resources.
[01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:02.800]  And this is all right in the document.
[01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:05.840]  You know, go to any search and type in Agenda 2030.
[01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:06.840]  Look it up.
[01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:07.840]  It's right there.
[01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:10.840]  And now we see that this is what the Obama administration is implementing here.
[01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:15.760]  Now going into the next phase, spend a minute on Agenda 2030, the next phase of the Rio
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:16.760]  Plan.
[01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:17.760]  Sure.
[01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:24.400]  There's 17 goals in this Agenda 2030 and there's something like 169, you know, subgoals, specific
[01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:26.440]  targets that they want to achieve.
[01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:28.600]  And I really cannot emphasize enough.
[01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:30.280]  People need to go out there and read this.
[01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:33.800]  They're just telling you, flat out, we're going to build a global government.
[01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:35.520]  It's going to redistribute your wealth.
[01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:38.120]  And of course by, you know, they say we're going to redistribute wealth.
[01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:42.000]  They're not talking about the multi-billionaires that are kind of behind the scenes pulling
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:43.000]  the strings here.
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:44.480]  They're talking about you, right?
[01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:45.480]  Middle class.
[01:27:45.480 --> 01:27:46.480]  That's right.
[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:47.480]  You're going to pay for it, Alex.
[01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:50.280]  We got to get you up for a full hour in the near future to go through the documents, you
[01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:54.400]  know, to go through each section of this and really educate people with an emergency
[01:27:54.400 --> 01:27:55.400]  warning.
[01:27:55.400 --> 01:27:58.200]  But our reporters are, again, on the ground with the people that created this whole
[01:27:58.200 --> 01:28:00.160]  plan, our meeting.
[01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:01.400]  Thank you so much, Alex Newman.
[01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:02.400]  Great job.
[01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:06.200]  Now going back to Paul Joseph Watson in Dresden, we got two minutes to break.
[01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:11.760]  Paul, just looking at this plan to resettle the whole world with different groups of people
[01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:15.120]  controlled by the globalists, what do you make of this?
[01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:21.240]  Well, it's all about turning everything upside down and creating it from an EU.
[01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:24.080]  I mean, that's the last passage of the communist manifesto.
[01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:27.880]  They have to break everything down, whether it's good or bad, to build it up again.
[01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:29.880]  So that's what they're doing with the migrant issue.
[01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:35.600]  There's another tip bit, which is a journalist who is attending Bilderberg, Megan McCardle,
[01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:37.560]  who is a mainstream media journalist.
[01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:42.600]  Again, I messaged her on Twitter last night and said, you're a mainstream media journalist.
[01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:46.760]  This is the biggest scoop you could possibly have in your entire career.
[01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:50.840]  You're meeting with 120 of the most influential people on the planet.
[01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:52.720]  Are you going to report on it?
[01:28:52.720 --> 01:28:54.040]  This was her response.
[01:28:54.040 --> 01:28:55.200]  Oh, splendid.
[01:28:55.200 --> 01:28:57.680]  The anti-Semites have discovered me.
[01:28:57.680 --> 01:29:02.160]  So she just basically screamed, you're racist, simply for even asking about why she's-
[01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:06.160]  She's meeting with royalty world leaders, people that control trillions, and you're
[01:29:06.160 --> 01:29:08.640]  just a reporter that reaches millions of people a day.
[01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:12.600]  You say it's on Drudge Report, all over the news, you've been on CBS TV, all of it, and
[01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:15.800]  she just says, yeah, you're anti-Semitic.
[01:29:15.800 --> 01:29:18.040]  You're racist just for asking the question.
[01:29:18.040 --> 01:29:22.440]  Then there's an NBC foreign affairs correspondent who is also attending, who I tweeted out last
[01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:23.440]  night.
[01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:24.440]  He's going to be here.
[01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:25.880]  He's not going to report on it.
[01:29:25.880 --> 01:29:28.600]  This could potentially make some of these journalists careers.
[01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:30.240]  They're going to stay absolutely silent.
[01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:33.480]  They're being brought in to prove that they'll be managers later.
[01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:34.480]  They're not there to be journalists.
[01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:37.960]  They're there to learn the conspiracy and show they'll keep their mouth shut.
[01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:38.960]  Great job, Paul.
[01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:42.200]  Big reports being filed as we speak at infowars.com.
[01:29:42.200 --> 01:29:43.200]  You are kicking butt.
[01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:44.200]  Amazing.
[01:29:44.200 --> 01:29:45.200]  This is true journalism.
[01:29:45.200 --> 01:29:48.760]  We'll be back with Roger Stone with what he called Deep Intrigue when I talk to him
[01:29:48.760 --> 01:29:49.760]  at 2.15 a.m.
[01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:51.760]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.760 --> 01:29:54.200]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.200 --> 01:30:01.200]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:03.360]  Joe Biggs here with infowars.com.
[01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:08.720]  Today I want to talk to you about guns, why we have them, why the Bill of Rights guarantees
[01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:13.440]  that we can have them, and why my right to have a gun is more important than your right
[01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:15.400]  to rail against it in the press.
[01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:20.080]  I believe every good journalist needs to know why the Second Amendment must be considered
[01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:22.680]  more essential than the First Amendment.
[01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:27.600]  Rights may be a bitter pill to swallow, but the right to keep and bear arms is not an
[01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:33.000]  outdated, dusty idea some old dead white guys dreamed up in fear of the Redcoats.
[01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:38.800]  No, it is just as essential to liberty today as it was in 1776.
[01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:43.200]  The original amendments we refer to as the Bill of Rights contain ten of what the constitutional
[01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:45.920]  framers termed unalienable rights.
[01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:48.600]  The Bill of Rights came to us with blinders on.
[01:30:48.600 --> 01:30:51.440]  It doesn't recognize color or class or wealth.
[01:30:51.440 --> 01:30:56.520]  It protects not just the rights of actors or editors or reporters, but extends even
[01:30:56.520 --> 01:30:58.200]  to those we love to hate.
[01:30:58.200 --> 01:31:01.160]  This is a small excerpt from Tralton Heston.
[01:31:01.160 --> 01:31:04.160]  Clean pure drinking water, you can't survive without it.
[01:31:04.160 --> 01:31:05.160]  But where do you get it?
[01:31:05.160 --> 01:31:10.280]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new groundbreaking gravity-fed water filtration system that is
[01:31:10.280 --> 01:31:11.280]  like no other.
[01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:16.600]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from firstly any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking
[01:31:16.600 --> 01:31:21.760]  water, pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new gravity block core with
[01:31:21.760 --> 01:31:23.480]  a hybrid chromatic shell.
[01:31:23.480 --> 01:31:31.440]  It removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants,
[01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:34.640]  volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[01:31:34.640 --> 01:31:40.320]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons, stainless steel construction, easy assembly, low maintenance,
[01:31:40.320 --> 01:31:45.040]  replacement filters are simple to install, and now, as part of an exclusive limited time

[01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:05.120]  More than two years ago, Info Wars first told you about our research into what has
[01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:06.920]  been called the iodine conspiracy.
[01:32:06.920 --> 01:32:11.360]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can
[01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:16.520]  devastate IQ, and how the government, knowingly, started taking iodine out of the food and
[01:32:16.520 --> 01:32:20.280]  adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[01:32:20.280 --> 01:32:23.960]  They took the good halogen-O and put the deadly halogen in.
[01:32:23.960 --> 01:32:28.480]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling
[01:32:28.480 --> 01:32:30.920]  you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[01:32:30.920 --> 01:32:36.360]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between
[01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:42.200]  iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation
[01:32:42.200 --> 01:32:43.800]  ever concerning iodine.
[01:32:43.800 --> 01:32:45.720]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[01:32:45.720 --> 01:32:50.000]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to
[01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:51.960]  any optimum health regimen.
[01:32:51.960 --> 01:33:16.120]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 Today at infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:33:16.120 --> 01:33:24.560]  It is unprecedented, Bernie Sanders won more states and more delegates than Hillary, but
[01:33:24.560 --> 01:33:28.920]  the superdelegates just met with the Associated Press the day before the California primary
[01:33:28.920 --> 01:33:32.280]  and these other five states and just decided to give it all to Hillary.
[01:33:32.280 --> 01:33:36.880]  And even the New York Daily News, extremely liberal, came out and said, this is election
[01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:37.880]  fraud.
[01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:38.880]  This has been stolen.
[01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:42.280]  The Republicans tried to do this with Trump, but had to back down at least so far.
[01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:43.440]  They tried to sell the idea.
[01:33:43.440 --> 01:33:46.920]  Of course, your vote doesn't count, but with Hillary, it's worked, but now they're saying
[01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:50.940]  the Bernie people are terrorists and are evil and the Associated Press is warning their
[01:33:50.940 --> 01:33:55.960]  reporters to look out for the Bernie people because the AP up at the top with voter news
[01:33:55.960 --> 01:34:00.600]  services under a new name runs the show, so they've got to be watched very closely in
[01:34:00.600 --> 01:34:02.800]  the general election going up against Trump.
[01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:06.720]  They're now selling the idea that he's going to lose and lose big time so that when they
[01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:08.840]  steal the election, we accept it.
[01:34:08.840 --> 01:34:13.640]  But Roger Shown and I and many others understood what was happening a year ago and began to
[01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:16.600]  beat the drum that they'd try to steal it with a broker convention.
[01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:17.720]  People said that would never happen.
[01:34:17.720 --> 01:34:18.720]  They tried it.
[01:34:18.720 --> 01:34:19.720]  They've backed off.
[01:34:19.720 --> 01:34:22.920]  You have to first admit something's happening like there's Bilderberg meeting.
[01:34:22.920 --> 01:34:24.440]  Oh, nothing like that exists.
[01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:30.400]  I had the New York Times eight years ago say that it didn't exist and that I was in Virginia
[01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:34.560]  and that I was mentally ill and was schizophrenic and that I wasn't being followed by Black
[01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:39.960]  Sinans and wasn't thrown out of the hotel even though it was all on tape.
[01:34:39.960 --> 01:34:41.080]  Eight years later, they got admitted.
[01:34:41.080 --> 01:34:42.080]  It's real.
[01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:44.080]  They still say we're crazy for covering it.
[01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:47.040]  I want to play a short clip and then go to Roger Stone who wasn't even scheduled today,
[01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:50.200]  but I saw a late night tweet from like two in the morning.
[01:34:50.200 --> 01:34:54.680]  I was up, hit him back and said, yeah, and he's, well, there's a lot of intrigue.
[01:34:54.680 --> 01:34:55.680]  And so yes, I'll pop it.
[01:34:55.680 --> 01:34:57.320]  He's going to pop in for just like 10 minutes.
[01:34:57.320 --> 01:34:59.480]  But first I've got to start getting to these Donald Trump clips.
[01:34:59.480 --> 01:35:03.080]  Trump blast Hillary and rigged system.
[01:35:03.080 --> 01:35:05.560]  This is how he'll defeat him.
[01:35:05.560 --> 01:35:10.080]  Exposing they plan to steal it now is, is, is, is the only way folks, he's going to destroy
[01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:11.080]  her in the debates.
[01:35:11.080 --> 01:35:12.080]  You name it in my view.
[01:35:12.080 --> 01:35:13.080]  We'll ask Stone.
[01:35:13.080 --> 01:35:14.080]  We haven't talked yet.
[01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:15.080]  I don't know if he thinks my views accurate.
[01:35:15.080 --> 01:35:19.200]  We'll talk to him in a moment and get the quote, heavy intrigue in New York or what the big
[01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:20.200]  news is.
[01:35:20.200 --> 01:35:21.200]  I don't know yet either.
[01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:23.440]  But first let's go to the short clip.
[01:35:23.440 --> 01:35:26.160]  There's one thing we all have learned.
[01:35:26.160 --> 01:35:34.240]  We can't fix the rigged system by relying on very, and, and I mean this so, so strongly
[01:35:34.240 --> 01:35:42.320]  on the very people who rigged it and they rigged it and do not ever think anything differently.
[01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:48.560]  We can't solve our problems by counting on the politicians who created our problems.
[01:35:48.560 --> 01:36:05.440]  But Clintons have turned the politics of personal enrichment into an art form for themselves.
[01:36:05.440 --> 01:36:13.040]  They've made hundreds of millions of dollars selling access, selling favors, selling government
[01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:18.520]  contracts, and I mean hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:36:18.520 --> 01:36:25.680]  Eric Clinton even did all of the work on a totally illegal private server, something
[01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:31.440]  that how she's getting away with this folks, nobody understands, designed to keep her corrupt
[01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:37.040]  dealings out of the public record, putting the security of the entire country at risk
[01:36:37.040 --> 01:36:43.760]  and a president in a corrupt system is totally protecting her, not right.
[01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:51.960]  I am going to give a major speech on probably Monday of next week, and we're going to be
[01:36:51.960 --> 01:36:55.760]  discussing all of the things that have taken place with the Clintons.
[01:36:55.760 --> 01:36:59.760]  I think you're going to find it very informative and very, very, very important.
[01:36:59.760 --> 01:37:00.760]  They're creating a master dossier.
[01:37:00.760 --> 01:37:10.920]  I know that's several of them stoned from the inquirer and Larry Nichols and others.
[01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:15.080]  I wonder if the press will want to attend, who knows.
[01:37:15.080 --> 01:37:16.080]  I love this guy.
[01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:17.080]  He's for real.
[01:37:17.080 --> 01:37:20.280]  Hillary Clinton turned the State Department into her private hedge fund.
[01:37:20.280 --> 01:37:26.720]  The Russians, the Saudis, the Chinese all gave money to Bill and Hillary and got favorable
[01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:29.240]  treatment in return.
[01:37:29.240 --> 01:37:35.040]  It's a sad day in America when foreign governments with deep pockets have more influence in our
[01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:38.280]  own country than our great citizens.
[01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:44.840]  This man did this as he won the historic primaries, got more votes than any Republican ever has.
[01:37:44.840 --> 01:37:46.560]  This is unprecedented, believe me.
[01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:50.120]  He would not be working for them as a show and saying this because this damage to them
[01:37:50.120 --> 01:37:51.120]  is irrevocable.
[01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:56.720]  He is risking his life, and I have never seen gigantic, elephant wavos anywhere near this
[01:37:56.720 --> 01:37:58.960]  size by somebody at this level.
[01:37:58.960 --> 01:38:01.320]  This is true manliness.
[01:38:01.320 --> 01:38:02.520]  Even though he's not perfect, I don't care.
[01:38:02.520 --> 01:38:03.800]  I'm all in for Donald Trump.
[01:38:03.800 --> 01:38:08.960]  I admire this guy, I tentatively started supporting him a year ago because I knew Hillary was
[01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:10.200]  pure evil.
[01:38:10.200 --> 01:38:11.600]  I'm so proud I made the right choice.
[01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:15.920]  My gut said, do it, don't just sit back and oh, both are bad and act like I'm all high
[01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:16.920]  and mighty.
[01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:17.920]  I am all in.
[01:38:17.920 --> 01:38:22.800]  But I'm telling you folks, it is, it is, it is a death battle.
[01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:24.680]  This is so hardcore.
[01:38:24.680 --> 01:38:28.480]  Roger Stone, the latest, just bang, bam, bam, I got a lot to talk about.
[01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:32.160]  What to expect next, where we're going, what the real numbers are.
[01:38:32.160 --> 01:38:36.720]  The Sanders people, they just got robbed, they admit that, even a lot of liberal media
[01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:37.720]  is admitting it.
[01:38:37.720 --> 01:38:40.840]  How does Trump reach out and say, look, they're trying to steal it from me and him.
[01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:44.160]  Come to the guy the establishment hates, Goldman Sachs, the big money.
[01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:45.600]  They're all against me.
[01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:46.600]  Don't be idiots.
[01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:48.240]  Hillary's a fascist war monger.
[01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:50.160]  Roger Stone, what do we do?
[01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:55.720]  Well, first of all, Alex, pardon me if I have kind of a Cheshire grin over that performance
[01:38:55.720 --> 01:38:56.720]  by Trump.
[01:38:56.720 --> 01:39:03.240]  I'm really happy because he's back on offense, he is breaking through because the mainstream
[01:39:03.240 --> 01:39:09.320]  media coverage, even of the Clinton financial crimes has been inadequate, with the one exception
[01:39:09.320 --> 01:39:13.320]  of the New York Times, which has been exceptional.
[01:39:13.320 --> 01:39:19.800]  The mainstream media has been uninter, has been disinterested in the biggest two thieves
[01:39:19.800 --> 01:39:22.160]  since Bonnie and Clyde.
[01:39:22.160 --> 01:39:25.680]  And Trump is going to lay this out chapter and verse for the American people.
[01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:29.440]  It is one of Hillary's greatest vulnerabilities.
[01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:32.440]  It also goes beyond just greed, and that's the issue.
[01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:37.320]  I think that's the key word, the epic greed of the Clintons.
[01:39:37.320 --> 01:39:43.400]  They've also put our national interests at risk, selling nuclear secrets or pardon me,
[01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:49.800]  military systems to the Chinese through morale, in this case, trading millions of dollars
[01:39:49.800 --> 01:39:53.280]  with the Russians and the Chinese and the Saudis, as Trump said.
[01:39:53.280 --> 01:39:59.600]  So I was very glad to see Trump pivot, I think Trump University is behind us.
[01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:04.640]  Now, even that is an outrage, because I now know more than the last time I was with you,
[01:40:04.640 --> 01:40:05.640]  Alex.
[01:40:05.640 --> 01:40:14.760]  Laureate education is a multi-billion dollar Wall Street scam in which Bill and Hillary,
[01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:18.280]  Bill took $16 million in fees.
[01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:22.640]  We don't know what he took in stock options because it's never been disclosed, and shortly
[01:40:22.640 --> 01:40:32.240]  thereafter Hillary laid $150 million in federal money on Laureate education, a failing chain
[01:40:32.240 --> 01:40:33.240]  of schools.
[01:40:33.240 --> 01:40:34.240]  Sure, sure.
[01:40:34.240 --> 01:40:37.680]  I mean, their program is to be totally criminal to a level where they're interconnected so
[01:40:37.680 --> 01:40:38.680]  they can never go down.
[01:40:38.680 --> 01:40:41.080]  As Skype just went down, so that's why I'm interrupting here.
[01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:45.280]  And ladies and gentlemen, this is just so over the top.
[01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:47.840]  Our audience knows about all this corruption.
[01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:51.600]  And then we now know what I said weeks ago has been confirmed, the judge has connected
[01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:55.480]  all these La Raza groups, heads some of them up, the media thinks you're so dumb, they
[01:40:55.480 --> 01:41:02.600]  go, oh, the La Raza lawyer guild has no connection to La Raza, it runs it, it created it.
[01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:05.520]  And again, hey, white supremacists want to be in those groups?
[01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:07.760]  Mexican supremacists want to be in these groups?
[01:41:07.760 --> 01:41:09.920]  The white supremacists think their group's good too?
[01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:13.120]  People in the La Raza think they're good?
[01:41:13.120 --> 01:41:14.120]  Folks have to stand up against this.
[01:41:14.120 --> 01:41:16.480]  We're going to get, we're getting back on phone.
[01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:22.040]  If you want to, there's a number right here, we can just call them right now.
[01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:24.520]  And I know if you don't have to even pull it out of the computer, we can just do it
[01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:25.520]  that way.
[01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:30.000]  But I want to talk about exactly, I know Stone's been advising Trump to be more aggressive.
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:33.120]  I know Trump's creating dossiers, that's what Nichols wanted to talk about yesterday.
[01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:38.680]  He's talking to them, they're vetting everything to really go whole hog against the Clintons.
[01:41:38.680 --> 01:41:42.040]  And I would go after him on Fast and Furious because they act like she's not involved in
[01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:43.040]  that.
[01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:45.040]  She ran that out of the State Department.
[01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:48.240]  And that's what Fast and Furious really was, was arms to Al Qaeda and ISIS.
[01:41:48.240 --> 01:41:55.320]  And that's how Benghazi and Fast and Furious with the Mexican gun running from the U.S.
[01:41:55.320 --> 01:42:00.160]  and the Mexico, that's how they connect because the gun running was only a cover to blame
[01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:01.160]  the Second Amendment.
[01:42:01.160 --> 01:42:05.120]  But that was an overall cover for a larger mission that was to get guns to Al Qaeda and
[01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:09.800]  ISIS, which is anything the global's do, always has these multi-facets.
[01:42:09.800 --> 01:42:12.040]  I'll call him.
[01:42:12.040 --> 01:42:15.320]  We've got Stone, he's back on phone.
[01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:18.040]  Okay, we have him back.
[01:42:18.040 --> 01:42:21.280]  Roger, good to have you back with us, my friend, go ahead.
[01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:25.000]  So Alex, I would confess to be exhausted.
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:29.680]  As you know, I got to New York earlier this week.
[01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:36.280]  So I really think that this new initiative by Trump puts him on offense because this
[01:42:36.280 --> 01:42:38.040]  race is not about Donald Trump.
[01:42:38.040 --> 01:42:44.120]  He hasn't been running the country for 30 years and he hasn't been running it as a continuation.
[01:42:44.120 --> 01:42:47.160]  So this is a referendum on Hillary, it must be.
[01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:51.480]  There are two, I think, cornerstones in this fight, two books that every American needs
[01:42:51.480 --> 01:42:52.600]  to read.
[01:42:52.600 --> 01:42:59.520]  One is Clinton Cash by Peter Schweitzer, which is a masterpiece, showing how the Clintons
[01:42:59.520 --> 01:43:04.160]  are epically greedy and how they have gained the system to line their pockets.
[01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:09.480]  And then, of course, there is the Clinton's War on Women, which outlines Hillary's epic
[01:43:09.480 --> 01:43:11.480]  abuse of Bill's sexual assault victim.
[01:43:11.480 --> 01:43:14.440]  And that's your book available at infowarstore.com.
[01:43:14.440 --> 01:43:17.760]  Let me just digress with my questions because I know you're way above me politically and
[01:43:17.760 --> 01:43:23.120]  understanding all this, but from a lay perspective, I have Newark Daily News, Politico and others
[01:43:23.120 --> 01:43:27.040]  admitting that Hillary stole this from Sanders and he was the real guy, and the Superdelegates
[01:43:27.040 --> 01:43:28.040]  robbed him.
[01:43:28.040 --> 01:43:31.400]  Don't we make a big deal out of that and reach out to the third of the Sanders people
[01:43:31.400 --> 01:43:35.680]  that you talked about who aren't total communist idiots and say, come on, go for Trump?
[01:43:35.680 --> 01:43:37.360]  I mean, isn't that the big drive?
[01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:41.240]  If Trump came out and said, hey, Sanders got robbed, they're trying to rob me, go with
[01:43:41.240 --> 01:43:42.240]  me.
[01:43:42.240 --> 01:43:43.240]  He actually said it last night.
[01:43:43.240 --> 01:43:47.640]  I think the exact quote is, to those Bernie Sanders systems who believe the nomination
[01:43:47.640 --> 01:43:52.680]  was rigged by Superdelegates, we welcome you with open arms.
[01:43:52.680 --> 01:43:58.240]  Now he said this right after he made the point that both he and Sanders opposed the globalist
[01:43:58.240 --> 01:44:04.280]  trade deals like NAFTA and TPP that have destroyed the American job market.
[01:44:04.280 --> 01:44:11.480]  We know that he and Bernie Sanders are both non-interventionists, not neocons, as Hillary
[01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:15.560]  Clinton is, so I think there's a real opportunity there.
[01:44:15.560 --> 01:44:21.960]  That is why the Soros crowd is trying to smear Trump as a bigot and a racist because those
[01:44:21.960 --> 01:44:28.400]  left-leaning votes will go to Trump if they don't disqualify Trump by smaring him.
[01:44:28.400 --> 01:44:30.640]  Man, I just hope some of the liberals aren't idiots.
[01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:34.480]  I mean, how obvious is this that the whole power structure hates Trump?
[01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:45.120]  Well, look, there was a lot of piling on last week because we got sidetracked in the ridiculousness
[01:44:45.120 --> 01:44:47.440]  of the Trump University case.
[01:44:47.440 --> 01:44:49.240]  This is a political case.
[01:44:49.240 --> 01:44:54.240]  This is a peanut compared to the multi-million-dollar theft in the for-profit education.
[01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:57.880]  And so Trump only took the bait in that he debated that instead of ignoring it and moving
[01:44:57.880 --> 01:45:01.160]  on, even though he's right about the judge, it's a sidetrall.
[01:45:01.160 --> 01:45:05.160]  He's right about the entire thing, but I am of the theory that anytime Trump is not talking
[01:45:05.160 --> 01:45:11.200]  about Hillary Clinton's failed record for abuse of women or her corruption or her incompetence
[01:45:11.200 --> 01:45:18.160]  or her lying, and that he isn't talking about trade and immigration and our ridiculous fiscal
[01:45:18.160 --> 01:45:19.160]  situation.
[01:45:19.160 --> 01:45:20.160]  I totally agree.
[01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:23.720]  So let me try to influence Trump right now, because I know, I mean, obviously, he has
[01:45:23.720 --> 01:45:25.120]  people out there watching talk to him.
[01:45:25.120 --> 01:45:26.120]  My listeners talked to him.
[01:45:26.120 --> 01:45:27.120]  You talked to him.
[01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:28.680]  I've talked to him before here on air.
[01:45:28.680 --> 01:45:32.880]  What about the fact that I see him talk about Benghazi, but not Fast and Furious?
[01:45:32.880 --> 01:45:35.480]  She ran that through the State Department.
[01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:37.040]  That was really gun-running to Mexico.
[01:45:37.040 --> 01:45:38.040]  This has been proven now.
[01:45:38.040 --> 01:45:39.040]  Judicial Watch proved it.
[01:45:39.040 --> 01:45:40.040]  We had it before.
[01:45:40.040 --> 01:45:41.040]  It was even in Judicial Watch.
[01:45:41.040 --> 01:45:42.800]  And guns are being sent to Al Qaeda and ISIS.
[01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:47.240]  I think you should tie Benghazi and that together, and then she's done.
[01:45:47.240 --> 01:45:51.720]  Once you tie it to that, that ties the guns in, her coming after the guns, with giving
[01:45:51.720 --> 01:45:53.480]  guns to Al Qaeda.
[01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:57.080]  She sent guns to Al Qaeda and ISIS while trying to get our guns.
[01:45:57.080 --> 01:45:58.080]  I mean, boom.
[01:45:58.080 --> 01:45:59.080]  I think that's a great idea.
[01:45:59.080 --> 01:46:01.480]  Well, I agree with you, Alex.
[01:46:01.480 --> 01:46:05.160]  It's only June, and we have a long campaign ahead of us.
[01:46:05.160 --> 01:46:11.680]  It's not like there is a lack of material when it comes to the incompetence or the treachery
[01:46:11.680 --> 01:46:13.880]  of the Clintons.
[01:46:13.880 --> 01:46:16.760]  These issues will be spelled out one by one.
[01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:17.760]  Sure.
[01:46:17.760 --> 01:46:19.880]  Let's talk about some private stuff, what a tiger you are.
[01:46:19.880 --> 01:46:23.080]  I was there when, you know, you got the word that your mom wasn't probably going to make
[01:46:23.080 --> 01:46:24.080]  it.
[01:46:24.080 --> 01:46:26.040]  It was about to go on morphine, and you said, this will be the last time I probably talked
[01:46:26.040 --> 01:46:27.040]  her.
[01:46:27.040 --> 01:46:29.640]  You went and talked her, and then sure enough, you were right about that.
[01:46:29.640 --> 01:46:30.880]  Here you are still fighting hard.
[01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:31.880]  It's funny.
[01:46:31.880 --> 01:46:32.880]  We usually wear suits or sports jackets.
[01:46:32.880 --> 01:46:33.880]  I'm wearing a blue shirt.
[01:46:33.880 --> 01:46:36.800]  You're wearing a blue shirt today, and when you were on the show on Skype, so I guess
[01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:42.480]  you're kind of in battle mode, but kind of relaxing a little bit, so I know you've been
[01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:43.480]  through a lot, my friend.
[01:46:43.480 --> 01:46:48.000]  Well, first of all, I want to thank you, Alex, and everybody there at Info Wars for the beautiful
[01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.040]  flowers you sent out of my mother.
[01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:51.040]  You bet.
[01:46:51.040 --> 01:46:55.240]  You know, if you knew Olivia Soprano, you knew my mother.
[01:46:55.240 --> 01:47:02.680]  Tough, Sicilian, opinionated, determined, a patriot, and the saddest thing about her
[01:47:02.680 --> 01:47:06.560]  passing is it will be one less vote for Donald Trump.
[01:47:06.560 --> 01:47:13.360]  So we miss her, but she went down fighting, and I thank the literally thousands of people
[01:47:13.360 --> 01:47:18.760]  from Info Wars, or from Twitter, or from Facebook, who sent me their condolences.
[01:47:18.760 --> 01:47:21.880]  It has meant a great deal to Mrs. Stone and I, so.
[01:47:21.880 --> 01:47:22.880]  Sure.
[01:47:22.880 --> 01:47:23.880]  You didn't really make it public.
[01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:25.880]  I kind of did without your permission, so I'm sorry if that was a problem.
[01:47:25.880 --> 01:47:28.800]  But I just want to talk about behind the scenes, you know, you talking to your mom for the
[01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:31.720]  last time, and then coming in here and doing those interviews on Saturday.
[01:47:31.720 --> 01:47:35.240]  Well, the truth is, Alex, when I'm writing, I don't wear a suit.
[01:47:35.240 --> 01:47:40.360]  I know a lot of people think I wear a suit to bed, that I wear a suit every day, but
[01:47:40.360 --> 01:47:46.800]  now I am working on a number of issue memos, and I've written a terrific piece on Huma
[01:47:46.800 --> 01:47:49.880]  Abedin for Breitbart, which will be posted momentarily.
[01:47:49.880 --> 01:47:50.880]  Oh, Hillary's girlfriend?
[01:47:50.880 --> 01:47:54.440]  Well, I'm more concerned about the fact that-
[01:47:54.440 --> 01:47:55.440]  The Muslim connection?
[01:47:55.440 --> 01:47:57.720]  Yeah, she's seen all of the-
[01:47:57.720 --> 01:48:00.160]  Yeah, I don't care if Hillary's got two or three girlfriends.
[01:48:00.160 --> 01:48:02.680]  The issue is this woman works for Iran, basically, right?
[01:48:02.680 --> 01:48:05.160]  Well, I think she works for the Saudis.
[01:48:05.160 --> 01:48:11.920]  And one of the things that I learned was that prior to her either hooking up with the Clintons,
[01:48:11.920 --> 01:48:18.400]  she buys a very expensive home in the Washington suburbs, and the handbags that she's carrying
[01:48:18.400 --> 01:48:21.080]  go for about $1,500 apiece.
[01:48:21.080 --> 01:48:23.040]  Her parents are academics.
[01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:28.320]  She has an enormous amount of money, which is a trademark of a spy, interestingly enough.
[01:48:28.320 --> 01:48:32.080]  She edits radical Muslim journals in college.
[01:48:32.080 --> 01:48:35.520]  Her family is tied to groups that are tied to bin Laden.
[01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:37.360]  I laid it all out for Breitbart.
[01:48:37.360 --> 01:48:41.000]  Now, the last person to do this was a reporter at Vanity Fair.
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:45.400]  Of course, he was savagely attacked by media matters for America.
[01:48:45.400 --> 01:48:49.120]  I found the media matters for America piece on Huma.
[01:48:49.120 --> 01:48:53.920]  22 lies, falsehoods, complete obfuscations of the truth.
[01:48:53.920 --> 01:48:59.760]  So I think it should be untruthfulness matters for the folks over at MMFA.
[01:48:59.760 --> 01:49:03.360]  Sure, I knew she was connected to the Saudis, but also to the Iranians.
[01:49:03.360 --> 01:49:09.480]  I mean, this lady just off the chart, I mean, as a spy, I mean, the evidence pointing towards
[01:49:09.480 --> 01:49:10.480]  it.
[01:49:10.480 --> 01:49:13.520]  And then Hillary accidentally, for years with this server, saying put secret stuff, she
[01:49:13.520 --> 01:49:15.720]  knows everything she's doing is being watched.
[01:49:15.720 --> 01:49:20.080]  It sounds to me like it's instead of dropping the package under the park seat to the Russians
[01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:23.320]  or the Chinese or everybody, she just does it openly on the damn server.
[01:49:23.320 --> 01:49:25.160]  And then gets money in her foundation.
[01:49:25.160 --> 01:49:30.720]  The biggest problem though is that, or one of the most notable things is that Huma is
[01:49:30.720 --> 01:49:38.000]  the only person in the State Department to receive a special waiver that allowed her
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:43.880]  to not only get a full-time salary at state at the highest level, but also to be paid
[01:49:43.880 --> 01:49:50.960]  by Taneo strategies, the same place where Ed Robbins, who claims he's running a pro-Trump
[01:49:50.960 --> 01:49:58.360]  super PAC works at a Clinton connected lobbying entity, while she's triple dipping at the
[01:49:58.360 --> 01:49:59.360]  Clinton Foundation.
[01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:04.560]  At the same time, she and Cheryl Mills are the two women who go through all of Hillary's
[01:50:04.560 --> 01:50:08.360]  emails and decide what we can see and what we can't see.
[01:50:08.360 --> 01:50:15.440]  Now, since we know that there's classified and top secret information in the emails,
[01:50:15.440 --> 01:50:21.080]  Huma, who's most likely a spy for a foreign government, has had full access to all that
[01:50:21.080 --> 01:50:22.680]  classified material.
[01:50:22.680 --> 01:50:25.440]  As an American, I find that troubling.
[01:50:25.440 --> 01:50:30.320]  Well, I'm just speechless at this point, Roger Stone.
[01:50:30.320 --> 01:50:31.800]  How is the power elite?
[01:50:31.800 --> 01:50:35.920]  I know there's different elites and different combines, but they all meet like the mafia
[01:50:35.920 --> 01:50:40.200]  and decide which way to go and sometimes have wars if they don't.
[01:50:40.200 --> 01:50:44.800]  How do the Clintons just get away with anything and everything and so flagrant?
[01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:47.200]  She looks completely insane on television.
[01:50:47.200 --> 01:50:52.200]  She has more baggage than a baggage train, more skeletons than the biggest mausoleum
[01:50:52.200 --> 01:50:54.680]  on the earth, than the catacombs of Rome.
[01:50:54.680 --> 01:50:55.920]  I mean, I just don't get it.
[01:50:55.920 --> 01:51:00.120]  They're going to really put this woman in for four to eight years, who literally beats
[01:51:00.120 --> 01:51:04.440]  up men and choose the carpet as she's so hateful and she looks like she's about to
[01:51:04.440 --> 01:51:05.440]  die.
[01:51:05.440 --> 01:51:06.880]  I mean, what is the elite thinking?
[01:51:06.880 --> 01:51:07.880]  What does she have on them?
[01:51:07.880 --> 01:51:12.480]  Well, I think that they are, they unfortunately are trapped in the past.
[01:51:12.480 --> 01:51:17.960]  It is definitely, it was definitely much easier to conceal their crimes and what they were
[01:51:17.960 --> 01:51:22.760]  really like as people when we only had three television networks and a handful of national
[01:51:22.760 --> 01:51:25.840]  newspapers, the good old 80s.
[01:51:25.840 --> 01:51:30.120]  So if the Washington Post caught on to their corruption or heard from a secret service
[01:51:30.120 --> 01:51:36.520]  agent that Hillary had thrown a marble ashtray at Bill and grazed his cheek, that story could
[01:51:36.520 --> 01:51:37.920]  be suppressed.
[01:51:37.920 --> 01:51:41.960]  Today, those stories can't be suppressed.
[01:51:41.960 --> 01:51:47.040]  And I just don't think the Clintons understood that we are now going to re-ajudicate all
[01:51:47.040 --> 01:51:55.440]  of their greatest hits, travel gay, Vince Foster, file gay, the Mark Rich Pardons, Monica
[01:51:55.440 --> 01:51:56.440]  Lewinsky.
[01:51:56.440 --> 01:51:57.440]  Fast and furious.
[01:51:57.440 --> 01:51:59.080]  Obamacare was her brainchild.
[01:51:59.080 --> 01:52:00.080]  Everything is her.
[01:52:00.080 --> 01:52:01.080]  Everything.
[01:52:01.080 --> 01:52:02.080]  This woman squatting on us.
[01:52:02.080 --> 01:52:03.080]  Libya.
[01:52:03.080 --> 01:52:04.080]  Benghazi.
[01:52:04.080 --> 01:52:09.320]  But the overthrow of Gaddafi and the fact that women in Libya have been put back 200
[01:52:09.320 --> 01:52:10.320]  years.
[01:52:10.320 --> 01:52:11.320]  Sure, sure, sure.
[01:52:11.320 --> 01:52:13.040]  And listen, you're here covering topics and information.
[01:52:13.040 --> 01:52:16.440]  You know, my audience is one of the most informed out there, but they love hearing the facts
[01:52:16.440 --> 01:52:17.960]  to be able to tell others.
[01:52:17.960 --> 01:52:18.960]  But they know it.
[01:52:18.960 --> 01:52:23.040]  What about a little bit of, not inside baseball, but Trump looks totally energized.
[01:52:23.040 --> 01:52:25.200]  The courage he's got, he's super smart.
[01:52:25.200 --> 01:52:26.200]  The gloves are off.
[01:52:26.200 --> 01:52:27.720]  There's bare knuckles on now.
[01:52:27.720 --> 01:52:29.400]  I know you are in New York.
[01:52:29.400 --> 01:52:34.080]  I mean, this is just an amazing time.
[01:52:34.080 --> 01:52:38.720]  What else can you tell us just about this phenomenon and where it's going and other tidbits?
[01:52:38.720 --> 01:52:44.520]  Well, as we've discussed on the show a number of times, Trump used a communications-based
[01:52:44.520 --> 01:52:49.040]  strategy to win the nomination, and it turned out to be brilliant.
[01:52:49.040 --> 01:52:55.960]  The campaign is now struggling to build the kind of organization, gorilla as it may be,
[01:52:55.960 --> 01:52:57.840]  to contend.
[01:52:57.840 --> 01:53:00.800]  But we are late in some areas.
[01:53:00.800 --> 01:53:07.680]  For example, coalition building, Greeks for Trump, dentists for Trump, lawyers for Trump,
[01:53:07.680 --> 01:53:15.760]  airline pilots for Trump, Irish Americans for Trump, evangelical Christians for Trump.
[01:53:15.760 --> 01:53:17.080]  Latinos for Trump.
[01:53:17.080 --> 01:53:21.200]  These groups, there's so much grassroots enthusiasm.
[01:53:21.200 --> 01:53:28.000]  In many cases, when activists just couldn't wait for the campaign anymore to name a coordinator
[01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:31.240]  and put it together, they've gone out to do it themselves.
[01:53:31.240 --> 01:53:37.400]  There is a very broad reaching women for Trump organization in the works.
[01:53:37.400 --> 01:53:44.520]  So we are getting to the grassroots late when I say we, the Trump supporters, but I think
[01:53:44.520 --> 01:53:47.480]  the campaign is making strides finally to get organized.
[01:53:47.480 --> 01:53:51.520]  What a tragedy to have Hillary supposedly representing the ascension of women.
[01:53:51.520 --> 01:53:52.800]  I mean, what a joke.
[01:53:52.800 --> 01:53:53.800]  This is horrible.
[01:53:53.800 --> 01:53:55.520]  I would want her representing me.
[01:53:55.520 --> 01:53:59.840]  Yeah, as I said the other day, glass peeling my ass.
[01:53:59.840 --> 01:54:02.880]  This woman is privileged.
[01:54:02.880 --> 01:54:03.960]  She is abusive.
[01:54:03.960 --> 01:54:05.680]  She is a domestic violator.
[01:54:05.680 --> 01:54:10.240]  She's been running the country pretty much for 20 years.
[01:54:10.240 --> 01:54:12.160]  We've been living under her policies.
[01:54:12.160 --> 01:54:14.960]  But she lectures us about domestic violence.
[01:54:14.960 --> 01:54:22.040]  She lectures us against violence against women and rape when she's a domestic violator, when
[01:54:22.040 --> 01:54:28.240]  she has punched, scratched, and thrown things at Bill in multiple secret service agents.
[01:54:28.240 --> 01:54:29.240]  Sure, it's all coming out.
[01:54:29.240 --> 01:54:30.240]  So let me ask you this.
[01:54:30.240 --> 01:54:31.240]  It's too quick.
[01:54:31.240 --> 01:54:32.240]  I'm going to let you go and I appreciate your time.
[01:54:32.240 --> 01:54:36.360]  Can you get into any of the intrigue in New Yorkers that all inside campaign stuff?
[01:54:36.360 --> 01:54:46.200]  Well, what I refer to is the many moving pieces it takes for a monolith like this to shift
[01:54:46.200 --> 01:54:53.760]  and Trump moved off of the Trump University issue and onto this offensive issue at a key
[01:54:53.760 --> 01:54:54.760]  time.
[01:54:54.760 --> 01:54:56.280]  Alex, I have to go.
[01:54:56.280 --> 01:54:57.760]  So I appreciate being with you.
[01:54:57.760 --> 01:54:58.760]  All right.
[01:54:58.760 --> 01:54:59.760]  Thank you.
[01:54:59.760 --> 01:55:00.760]  Roger Stone, Roger Stone at StoneZone.com.
[01:55:00.760 --> 01:55:01.760]  Talk to you soon.
[01:55:01.760 --> 01:55:05.520]  Yeah, he's only supposed to be on for like 10 minutes to hear the next next call coming
[01:55:05.520 --> 01:55:06.520]  in.
[01:55:06.520 --> 01:55:07.520]  I tell you, that guy is a maniac.
[01:55:07.520 --> 01:55:11.520]  He works like 18 hours a day and I wonder, no wonder he's been out there for so long
[01:55:11.520 --> 01:55:12.520]  and he's been a pretty big insider.
[01:55:12.520 --> 01:55:15.920]  But for 15 years, he's been exposed in the New World Order and I like Roger Stone.
[01:55:15.920 --> 01:55:16.920]  He's a friend of mine now.
[01:55:16.920 --> 01:55:17.920]  I really liked him.
[01:55:17.920 --> 01:55:19.920]  You know, I'm kind of bored hanging out with most people.
[01:55:19.920 --> 01:55:20.920]  You know what I mean?
[01:55:20.920 --> 01:55:25.480]  I don't go to parties or even Hollywood stuff's boring, but characters like Roger Stone.
[01:55:25.480 --> 01:55:26.480]  That's interesting.
[01:55:26.480 --> 01:55:31.520]  Wow, we've got a bunch of other guests coming up at a bunch of news and a bunch of Donald
[01:55:31.520 --> 01:55:32.520]  Trump clips.
[01:55:32.520 --> 01:55:33.520]  I haven't gotten to.
[01:55:33.520 --> 01:55:34.520]  They just get better and better.
[01:55:34.520 --> 01:55:38.280]  But before I tell you what's coming up next, our reporter is obviously the witness what
[01:55:38.280 --> 01:55:41.380]  happened out in California and more.
[01:55:41.380 --> 01:55:43.400]  Just briefly, Hillary for present shirts.
[01:55:43.400 --> 01:55:47.000]  We had one variant that also helps from the whole show.
[01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:51.800]  So it's a win-win that I said was going to be a collector's item and it was so we stopped
[01:55:51.800 --> 01:55:55.960]  making that one and made some changes to it because it was so popular.
[01:55:55.960 --> 01:56:02.440]  And this new variant sells out with a limited amount was a 4.9 star review men and women
[01:56:02.440 --> 01:56:06.720]  style shirt unisex.
[01:56:06.720 --> 01:56:09.760]  We will come out with a new version that is pretty much the same just has on the right
[01:56:09.760 --> 01:56:13.800]  arm info wars.com.
[01:56:13.800 --> 01:56:15.520]  So when this sells out, it's gone.
[01:56:15.520 --> 01:56:17.320]  I've told the crew we're not making this anymore.
[01:56:17.320 --> 01:56:19.080]  A new design is coming out.
[01:56:19.080 --> 01:56:20.080]  That's pretty much the same.
[01:56:20.080 --> 01:56:24.880]  It just says info wars.com on the right shoulder in a red.
[01:56:24.880 --> 01:56:30.040]  And on the back, it says legalized freedom info wars.com in white.
[01:56:30.040 --> 01:56:35.560]  I'm going to have that change to white and on the arm, it's going to be red.
[01:56:35.560 --> 01:56:36.720]  And that is the rest of the story.
[01:56:36.720 --> 01:56:40.920]  If you want to support the broadcast and get a great shirt to meet like-minded people and

[01:57:15.760 --> 01:57:16.760]  We had it in once.
[01:57:16.760 --> 01:57:19.880]  It's got so many ingredients and to have the highest quality, have it test totally clean
[01:57:19.880 --> 01:57:23.400]  and pure, we just can't make stuff sometimes, you really have the highest standards.
[01:57:23.400 --> 01:57:24.400]  That's how this works.
[01:57:24.400 --> 01:57:25.400]  The planet is so contaminated.
[01:57:25.400 --> 01:57:29.640]  It's so expensive to test these, but it should be like 80 bucks.
[01:57:29.640 --> 01:57:30.640]  It's 34.95.
[01:57:30.640 --> 01:57:32.160]  Oh, I forgot to add, it's a discount.
[01:57:32.160 --> 01:57:33.160]  It's a huge bottle.
[01:57:33.160 --> 01:57:35.040]  In fact, that's going to bring me a bottle earlier.
[01:57:35.040 --> 01:57:37.520]  Somebody bring me a bottle so I can wave it around maybe.
[01:57:37.520 --> 01:57:39.040]  Yeah, well, say lobby, whatever.
[01:57:39.040 --> 01:57:41.760]  Again, I'm like a Hitler's bunker here.
[01:57:41.760 --> 01:57:43.320]  Great crew, it's not enough people.

[02:00:13.360 --> 02:00:27.080]  We have a Hillary for President Joker shirt, I never even plugged that one, it's got her
[02:00:27.080 --> 02:00:31.040]  face on it and horrifies me.
[02:00:31.040 --> 02:00:39.360]  If they say I never loved you, I'll sell you a bridge in Arizona.
[02:00:39.360 --> 02:00:51.120]  Kind of merge this song and oceanfront property together.
[02:00:51.120 --> 02:01:03.360]  Hills and valleys, cops and cars, you know, I've had a few Democrats I'm friends with.
[02:01:03.360 --> 02:01:07.800]  They kind of secretly agree with me and know what's going on but they're in politics so
[02:01:07.800 --> 02:01:10.040]  they go along with it.
[02:01:10.040 --> 02:01:14.400]  So alone, so alone.
[02:01:14.400 --> 02:01:18.680]  But they're funny folks, interesting, I've known them a long time so I still associate
[02:01:18.680 --> 02:01:19.680]  with them occasionally.
[02:01:19.680 --> 02:01:24.840]  And they call up laughing at me and say, oh Hillary's winning, oh Hillary, and I tell
[02:01:24.840 --> 02:01:28.480]  them, I say, you have any idea how successful I'm going to be if Hillary gets into office
[02:01:28.480 --> 02:01:34.840]  versus Donald Trump because these people are all going with her from a sociopathic perspective.
[02:01:34.840 --> 02:01:40.080]  They're not sociopaths but they can get in that mindset.
[02:01:40.080 --> 02:01:44.280]  I've bet on Donald Trump, he gets in and doesn't deliver or die trying, I'm going to have some
[02:01:44.280 --> 02:01:48.160]  problems but I can't just sit here and think about having a perfect record and playing
[02:01:48.160 --> 02:01:49.160]  it safe, okay?
[02:01:49.160 --> 02:01:55.400]  In a time in history like this, I got to get aggressive.
[02:01:55.400 --> 02:01:59.640]  Everybody knows when Democrats are in office, talk radio, libertarian media only grows
[02:01:59.640 --> 02:02:05.080]  and it's okay, we'll be looking probably at layoffs around here if Donald Trump gets in.
[02:02:05.080 --> 02:02:09.800]  But I'm fighting as hard as I can to get Trump in, I'd love to be able to have this country
[02:02:09.800 --> 02:02:11.720]  so free I could stop doing it.
[02:02:11.720 --> 02:02:15.240]  Of course that'll never happen but I mean really, I wouldn't be just risking my life
[02:02:15.240 --> 02:02:17.360]  and doing all this to fight these people.
[02:02:17.360 --> 02:02:21.200]  I mean you think I want to go to Cleveland and all these places?
[02:02:21.200 --> 02:02:22.200]  Really?
[02:02:22.200 --> 02:02:23.200]  No.
[02:02:23.200 --> 02:02:27.640]  They want to go up against the New World Order, these people are killers.
[02:02:27.640 --> 02:02:32.600]  I'm a man and I'm doing it because I won't back down, I'll stay in my ground.
[02:02:32.600 --> 02:02:35.640]  We've got that in bumper music somewhere, I never hear it played.
[02:02:35.640 --> 02:02:37.880]  Let's go ahead and, look I've got a bunch of Trump clips coming in the next segment
[02:02:37.880 --> 02:02:41.360]  and some gas but I'm going to go ahead and play this one more time, it's so powerful.
[02:02:41.360 --> 02:02:46.040]  Donald Trump blast Hillary and the rigging, I'm going to get to that next but first I
[02:02:46.040 --> 02:02:53.160]  want to play Donald Trump where he absolutely destroys the rig system and how corrupt she
[02:02:53.160 --> 02:02:54.160]  is.
[02:02:54.160 --> 02:02:59.720]  Let's get that clip one more time, it's so powerful.
[02:02:59.720 --> 02:03:02.480]  There's one thing we all have learned.
[02:03:02.480 --> 02:03:10.960]  We can't fix the rig system by relying on very, and I mean this so, so strongly, on
[02:03:10.960 --> 02:03:18.640]  the very people who rigged it and they rigged it and do not ever think anything differently.
[02:03:18.640 --> 02:03:24.840]  We can't solve our problems by counting on the politicians who created our problems,
[02:03:24.840 --> 02:03:38.040]  that Clintons have turned the politics of personal enrichment into an art form for themselves.
[02:03:38.040 --> 02:03:41.720]  That's courage, that's a man right there, this is hardcore.
[02:03:41.720 --> 02:03:49.160]  They've made hundreds of millions of dollars selling access, selling favors, selling government
[02:03:49.160 --> 02:03:54.960]  contracts and I mean hundreds of millions of dollars.
[02:03:54.960 --> 02:04:02.000]  Secretary Clinton even did all of the work on a totally illegal private server, something
[02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:07.760]  that how she's getting away with this folks, nobody understands, designed to keep her corrupt
[02:04:07.760 --> 02:04:13.360]  dealings out of the public record, putting the security of the entire country at risk
[02:04:13.360 --> 02:04:20.080]  and a president in a corrupt system is totally protecting her, not right.
[02:04:20.080 --> 02:04:28.280]  I am going to give a major speech on probably Monday of next week and we're going to be
[02:04:28.280 --> 02:04:31.360]  discussing all of the things that have taken place.
[02:04:31.360 --> 02:04:39.040]  Oh we got to get Nichols on because we communicate with Trump through Nichols and he had to communicate
[02:04:39.040 --> 02:04:42.040]  with him yesterday and so we need to get Nichols on tomorrow, I shouldn't get moved
[02:04:42.040 --> 02:04:43.040]  to him yesterday but stay there, stay there.
[02:04:43.040 --> 02:04:49.840]  I knew about this speech on Monday from Nichols, actually Sunday from Nichols.
[02:04:49.840 --> 02:04:53.000]  He told me this big speech was coming up and he was working with them but it obviously
[02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:57.400]  doesn't want to be interfaced openly, they'll communicate through this portal, let's get
[02:04:57.400 --> 02:05:01.040]  Nichols on tomorrow, they'll be back.
[02:05:01.040 --> 02:05:05.640]  The Constitutional Committees 1787 was held strict secrecy and at the end of the preceding
[02:05:05.640 --> 02:05:09.520]  citizens gathered outside Independence Hall to learn what had been produced behind closed
[02:05:09.520 --> 02:05:10.520]  doors.
[02:05:10.520 --> 02:05:13.960]  While Benjamin Franklin was leaving the hall a lady asked him, well doctor what have we
[02:05:13.960 --> 02:05:16.080]  got, a republic or a monarchy?
[02:05:16.080 --> 02:05:19.040]  To which he responded, a republic if you can keep it.
[02:05:19.040 --> 02:05:22.920]  But today not only have we lost a republic but most people don't even know what a republic
[02:05:22.920 --> 02:05:23.920]  even is.
[02:05:23.920 --> 02:05:28.080]  For one thing a republic is not a democracy, a republic operates under the rule of law
[02:05:28.080 --> 02:05:31.760]  which protects individual liberties so that the majority cannot take away the rights of
[02:05:31.760 --> 02:05:32.760]  the minority.
[02:05:32.760 --> 02:05:36.600]  Under a republic the government and its citizens all abide by the same laws regardless of political
[02:05:36.600 --> 02:05:37.840]  power or lack thereof.
[02:05:37.840 --> 02:05:41.560]  A democracy on the other hand only leads to mob rule fueled by the unrestrained whims
[02:05:41.560 --> 02:05:42.560]  of the public.
[02:05:42.560 --> 02:05:46.320]  In a democracy the individual or any groups of individuals composing the minority have
[02:05:46.320 --> 02:05:50.160]  no protection against the unlimited power of the majority, it is a case of majority
[02:05:50.160 --> 02:05:51.160]  over man.
[02:05:51.160 --> 02:05:54.720]  In other words under democracy two wolves can vote to eat the sheep for dinner but under
[02:05:54.720 --> 02:05:58.040]  a republic the sheep's right to life is protected by the rule of law.

[02:07:07.840 --> 02:07:12.840]  It's the Alexa pure breeze, it's an energy efficient HEPA ion cluster air purification
[02:07:12.840 --> 02:07:13.840]  system.
[02:07:13.840 --> 02:07:18.600]  It has a four stage purification process, it has a HEPA filter, pre filters and a carbon
[02:07:18.600 --> 02:07:23.320]  activated filters and the most amazing thing about it is it has this patented ion cluster
[02:07:23.320 --> 02:07:28.240]  technology that kills airborne microbes with a final byproduct of clean water.

[02:07:34.400 --> 02:07:39.040]  The Alexa pure breeze which operates as a fan, it's super quiet.
[02:07:39.040 --> 02:07:44.080]  The cheapest equivalent unit costs $259.95 and there are other units that are up to $899
[02:07:44.080 --> 02:07:49.000]  to $1000 to do exactly what this unit does but they're not as quiet because this one
[02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:54.160]  has a silent mode which runs at 16 decibels, go and just look up online the toxicity of
[02:07:54.160 --> 02:07:55.680]  being inside all the time.
[02:07:55.680 --> 02:08:03.520]  Great job Alexa pure info wars store dot com, Buckley thank you so much my friend.
[02:08:03.520 --> 02:08:10.800]  I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over
[02:08:10.800 --> 02:08:12.320]  the mind of man.
[02:08:12.320 --> 02:08:13.320]  Yes I have.
[02:08:13.320 --> 02:08:19.080]  I'm Thomas Jefferson, it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[02:08:19.080 --> 02:08:24.040]  Tech time pledge as Jefferson took it over 240 years ago.
[02:08:24.040 --> 02:08:31.880]  Step into your destiny or fall to the technotronic terror that is the New World Order.
[02:08:31.880 --> 02:08:37.800]  I'm Alex Jones your host broadcasting worldwide from deep in the heart of Texas occupied under
[02:08:37.800 --> 02:08:45.640]  FEMA region 6, under international edict of the United Nations.
[02:08:45.640 --> 02:09:07.760]  The news websites are info wars dot com and prison planets.
[02:09:07.760 --> 02:09:18.000]  I'm your host Alex Jones dedicated to taking on these anti-human parasites as above so
[02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:22.560]  below the ancient alchemist said we're gonna be looking below at the parasites here in
[02:09:22.560 --> 02:09:23.560]  a moment.
[02:09:23.560 --> 02:09:29.040]  It's not the kill folks, it's the thrill of the chase.
[02:09:29.040 --> 02:09:31.000]  People think fighting tyranny is a bad thing.
[02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:37.120]  Oh it's bad if nobody does it and tyranny totally takes over but the West has some history
[02:09:37.120 --> 02:09:43.480]  so do other cultures as well of fighting it and bringing in an amazing new era and this
[02:09:43.480 --> 02:09:46.400]  planet right now is trying to go in the right direction.
[02:09:46.400 --> 02:09:49.640]  All this evil is about suppressing us.
[02:09:49.640 --> 02:09:53.880]  Before I go to our guest who was the bottom of the hour and we have Leanne McAdoo, Joe
[02:09:53.880 --> 02:09:57.200]  Biggs and others did an incredible job last night covering Hillary stealing the election
[02:09:57.200 --> 02:09:58.200]  on the West Coast.
[02:09:58.200 --> 02:10:02.000]  Dr. Gribbs to be joining us popping in via video Skype from his medical offices but before
[02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:06.640]  we do that I've got some extremely powerful Trump clips I haven't gotten to.
[02:10:06.640 --> 02:10:09.920]  I played the one twice where he just says they're total criminals, they've rigged everything.
[02:10:09.920 --> 02:10:14.000]  We're gonna play clip where he says they've defeated the rigged system so far.
[02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:18.280]  Yeah Sanders didn't but first he talks about America first.
[02:10:18.280 --> 02:10:20.600]  This is what they call racist and evil.
[02:10:20.600 --> 02:10:23.720]  All the communist Chinese that killed you know 84 million of their own people under
[02:10:23.720 --> 02:10:28.200]  Mao and tens of millions of cents and have execution vans and oh they're gonna lecture
[02:10:28.200 --> 02:10:33.760]  us and the Saudi Arabians who head up the UN Human Rights Board and there's news on
[02:10:33.760 --> 02:10:36.720]  that today where they kill little kids so that's getting covered.
[02:10:36.720 --> 02:10:38.880]  All of this craziness is here.
[02:10:38.880 --> 02:10:42.840]  All of this is happening and unfolding and this is the nether outrage when he says the
[02:10:42.840 --> 02:10:43.840]  great evil.
[02:10:43.840 --> 02:10:49.680]  No, it's not mother or father those words being banned or male or female bathrooms.
[02:10:49.680 --> 02:10:55.040]  No, no, no it's America first why the country might actually be for the country not a bunch
[02:10:55.040 --> 02:10:57.160]  of foreign interests that came in and took it over.
[02:10:57.160 --> 02:11:00.680]  Let us play the blasphemy, the heresy.
[02:11:00.680 --> 02:11:02.960]  Let us play the anathema.
[02:11:02.960 --> 02:11:06.680]  Let us play the black magic to the new world order.
[02:11:06.680 --> 02:11:11.160]  The inversion of their system you're about to hear out of the out of the out of the out
[02:11:11.160 --> 02:11:15.120]  of the heretics mouth according to them Donald J. Trump.
[02:11:15.120 --> 02:11:22.840]  So in foreign policy we will never enter into any conflict unless it makes us safer as a
[02:11:22.840 --> 02:11:23.840]  nation.
[02:11:23.840 --> 02:11:27.800]  It has to make us safer as a nation.
[02:11:27.800 --> 02:11:37.320]  This is Hillary's foreign policy which invaded Libya, destabilized Iraq, unleashed ISIS and
[02:11:37.320 --> 02:11:44.280]  threw Syria into chaos and created the mass migration which is wreaking havoc all over
[02:11:44.280 --> 02:11:50.640]  the world and while putting Iran on the path to nuclear weapons and making them a dominant
[02:11:50.640 --> 02:11:56.360]  power in the Middle East and they are dominant and we have made them that way folks.
[02:11:56.360 --> 02:12:02.000]  We have made them that way and then better hope I'm president and then they call him
[02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:07.440]  anti-Semitic because he doesn't want to give Israel's enemies nuclear weapons.
[02:12:07.440 --> 02:12:11.600]  Our reporters are there via Twitter asking reporters that are at Bilderberg allowed in
[02:12:11.600 --> 02:12:12.600]  three of them.
[02:12:12.600 --> 02:12:13.600]  Hey talk to us.
[02:12:13.600 --> 02:12:14.600]  I don't talk to any semis.
[02:12:14.600 --> 02:12:15.600]  What?
[02:12:15.600 --> 02:12:19.160]  It's just like oh you don't like Obamacare you're racist, oh you don't like a judge
[02:12:19.160 --> 02:12:25.040]  part of a race-based group, La Raza you know the rule on Trump when he's his law firm heads
[02:12:25.040 --> 02:12:30.040]  up a boycott against Trump why didn't Trump say this guy's law firm heads up a boycott
[02:12:30.040 --> 02:12:35.200]  of me he should recuse himself it's just he's so I actually like the fact he's like a
[02:12:35.200 --> 02:12:39.440]  bull in a china shop but he opens up for him that's a good thing he doesn't care so you
[02:12:39.440 --> 02:12:45.240]  know what I like it like you look at Trump he hires more Hispanic people on average into
[02:12:45.240 --> 02:12:49.160]  management positions and women than any other major chain like he owns look it up they've
[02:12:49.160 --> 02:12:54.120]  done stories but he won't even defend himself he doesn't care because he's such an animal
[02:12:54.120 --> 02:12:57.800]  and I love it say it takes an animal to get up there and say Hillary's a total criminal
[02:12:57.800 --> 02:13:01.200]  and go over evidence of it I mean he knows she's a murdering criminal she knows she's
[02:13:01.200 --> 02:13:06.600]  a major mob boss so let's go ahead and go to this next clip here turn down Gendritch's
[02:13:06.600 --> 02:13:10.960]  200 million that Adelson offered told you that was happening Gendritch came out against
[02:13:10.960 --> 02:13:16.840]  he told you we've got the zeitgeist and not just through stone I tell you Nichols I already
[02:13:16.840 --> 02:13:20.560]  believed Nichols but his credibility went way up with what he told me this weekend and
[02:13:20.560 --> 02:13:24.840]  I still like yeah yeah and then he told me Trump's coming out next week with his big speech
[02:13:24.840 --> 02:13:30.440]  and boom I talked to stone about it at the point is it's all just intrigue is incredible
[02:13:30.440 --> 02:13:33.600]  let's play one more clip and I'm gonna go to our guest who's just popping in today with
[02:13:33.600 --> 02:13:38.320]  some updates and some other medical news let's go ahead and play a Trump says we beat a rig
[02:13:38.320 --> 02:13:45.320]  system and you know what we have so far when Sanders failed here it is every election year
[02:13:45.320 --> 02:13:53.040]  politicians promise change Obama promise change and it didn't work out too well and every year
[02:13:53.040 --> 02:13:59.760]  they fail to deliver why would politicians want to change a system that's totally rigged
[02:13:59.760 --> 02:14:04.920]  in order to keep them in power that's what they're doing folks why would politicians
[02:14:04.920 --> 02:14:12.440]  want to change a system that's right them and their friends very very wealthy I beat
[02:14:12.440 --> 02:14:18.960]  a rigged system by winning with overwhelming support the only way you could have done it
[02:14:18.960 --> 02:14:26.680]  landslides all over the country with every demographic on track to win 37 primary caucus
[02:14:26.680 --> 02:14:37.680]  victories in a field that began with 17 very talented people the man the man I personally
[02:14:37.680 --> 02:14:43.120]  told Ron Paul in his second run and I told him in his first run for president well there's
[02:14:43.120 --> 02:14:47.440]  one before that in the 80s but as a libertarian but as a republican I said listen you gotta
[02:14:47.440 --> 02:14:53.400]  get rid of Jesse Benton I said don't get your business but I just these decisions and I'm
[02:14:53.400 --> 02:14:57.560]  not a political person when I'm watching it and I said you gotta admit they're stealing
[02:14:57.560 --> 02:15:01.800]  these early states because he was winning these early states and he goes well Ron Paul
[02:15:01.800 --> 02:15:04.640]  you know he's talking about on air well they'll just say I got sour grapes he's talking about
[02:15:04.640 --> 02:15:08.680]  this on air some of this has been public I'm only telling you secrets it's just a little
[02:15:08.680 --> 02:15:12.720]  stuff during the breaks talking to him he wouldn't do it because he thought it was sour grapes
[02:15:12.720 --> 02:15:16.760]  if it's true it's true and that's what about Trump I've been telling him day one when they
[02:15:16.760 --> 02:15:20.640]  were stealing early stuff from him go crazy about it and then you go he's gonna lose saying
[02:15:20.640 --> 02:15:25.720]  they're rigging it that's just him you know no expose the whole stinking thing or they'll
[02:15:25.720 --> 02:15:30.000]  steal it with Donald Trump rallied against the rigged elections he could make our elections
[02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:34.480]  free and open again folks I'm not gonna vote they'll just rig them you get a
[02:15:34.480 --> 02:15:40.000]  landslide in there you make them steal that you bring down the whole enchilada I'm gonna
[02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:47.600]  go to Dr. Group now there's the quote to all those Bernie Sanders supporters left out
[02:15:47.600 --> 02:15:51.800]  in the cold by a rigged system of superdelegates we welcome with you with open arms Donald
[02:15:51.800 --> 02:15:58.440]  Trump that is a great comment now let me tell you something we're gonna play that clip
[02:15:58.440 --> 02:16:01.040]  on Leans on the other clips from Leans on I don't want to cut into groups time it took
[02:16:01.040 --> 02:16:04.480]  time I have to meet with us here they've like 30 minutes only have like 15 now not a group
[02:16:04.480 --> 02:16:09.480]  you want to give us some medical news but also want to get you on because you you develop
[02:16:09.480 --> 02:16:13.160]  living defense for us it took you over a year to do it it's got the kitchen sink in it I
[02:16:13.160 --> 02:16:17.320]  didn't realize that with all the nutraceutical buffs that you know with all the southern
[02:16:17.320 --> 02:16:22.680]  with buffs that would be seen as the holy grail of the healthy clean detox anti parasite
[02:16:22.680 --> 02:16:29.080]  cleanse it's sold out in two days and it took us it's sold out in December one run here
[02:16:29.080 --> 02:16:33.200]  we are six months later never had a product even try to get you to take some of the stuff
[02:16:33.200 --> 02:16:39.520]  out of it so we would have it we finally got some of it in a pretty good shipment and it's
[02:16:39.520 --> 02:16:43.520]  just amazing so let's infomercial here because this is important stuff we got these big parasites
[02:16:43.520 --> 02:16:47.240]  what about little parasites and other stuff why did this sell out because I never really
[02:16:47.240 --> 02:16:51.480]  promoted it's got all these ingredients why are we can see it's not even mainly our listeners
[02:16:51.480 --> 02:16:57.720]  coming it's outside folks buying this why is this so good well because people are actually
[02:16:57.720 --> 02:17:02.800]  waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most I mean I try to make sure
[02:17:02.800 --> 02:17:07.840]  that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system but right now
[02:17:07.840 --> 02:17:13.480]  we're dealing with massive parasites which is anything that's harmful to your body that
[02:17:13.480 --> 02:17:18.920]  lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading disease around
[02:17:18.920 --> 02:17:23.680]  we have biological warfare going on everywhere these are all parasites we have Legionnaires
[02:17:23.680 --> 02:17:30.760]  outbreaks happening cases nearly quadrupled in the last 15 years last TV from Texas to
[02:17:30.760 --> 02:17:35.320]  Minnesota just and they say we don't even test them we now put your kids with they put
[02:17:35.320 --> 02:17:41.000]  the kids in the classes with our kids like an orgy of disease was just like some religion
[02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:45.600]  is this child sacrifice what is this doctor group I'm really thinking that it's it's all
[02:17:45.600 --> 02:17:51.080]  planned because if you look at some of these conditions and then us opening up our borders
[02:17:51.080 --> 02:17:56.280]  and all the other countries opening up our their borders you're just dealing with a mass
[02:17:56.280 --> 02:18:02.560]  amount of parasites or harmful organisms or biological weapons that are spreading and
[02:18:02.560 --> 02:18:07.200]  mutating all across the world and I think that's one of the reasons why me all you have
[02:18:07.200 --> 02:18:12.200]  to do is look at the news these days you can type in refugees spreading disease I mean
[02:18:12.200 --> 02:18:18.200]  the CDC is going crazy right now there's a new antibiotic resistant E. Coli that just
[02:18:18.200 --> 02:18:22.640]  they just identified and in Britain they're they're talking about the sand fly that puts
[02:18:22.640 --> 02:18:26.920]  the parasite it's killing hundreds of thousands that eats the bacteria and it eats your body
[02:18:26.920 --> 02:18:33.600]  and it's just oh come into Europe oh kill us oh yeah that's called visceral leishman
[02:18:33.600 --> 02:18:38.640]  isis and that's another thing that's spreading it's a flesh eating disease some people are
[02:18:38.640 --> 02:18:44.240]  you discriminating against flesh eating death well because I always try to find the answers
[02:18:44.240 --> 02:18:48.680]  to you know there's always a solution even though the vaccine isn't helping what's wrong
[02:18:48.680 --> 02:18:52.720]  with that why are you racist against polio well I tell you what they're actually coming
[02:18:52.720 --> 02:18:58.800]  out I mean I think part of the reason is I think a lot of these things are biological
[02:18:58.800 --> 02:19:04.080]  that they're man-made and they're actually seeding the clouds and they're seeding people
[02:19:04.080 --> 02:19:08.280]  with sure and they're using the illegals as the cover that's coming in I agree yeah because
[02:19:08.280 --> 02:19:15.040]  I suddenly Zika's weaponized like you said months ago oh suddenly it's mutated more deadly
[02:19:15.040 --> 02:19:20.520]  that's right that's right and as a matter of fact president Obama just created a bill
[02:19:20.520 --> 02:19:29.480]  I think for $1.9 billion to fight Zika and that's I think about to be in the Senate we
[02:19:29.480 --> 02:19:35.800]  know that there was a hoax because it doesn't cause the birth defects in neurological diseases
[02:19:35.800 --> 02:19:40.720]  but that is a scary situation because there's vaccines in development right now that are
[02:19:40.720 --> 02:19:44.800]  supposed to be coming out within the next six to eight months so you have the Zika you
[02:19:44.800 --> 02:19:48.900]  have the tuberculosis that's happening right now you have the flesh eating disease you
[02:19:48.900 --> 02:19:53.520]  have polio you have measles and by the way just interrupt you came out a few months
[02:19:53.520 --> 02:19:58.960]  ago that the Rockefeller Foundation isolated Zika in 54 and was involved in weaponizing
[02:19:58.960 --> 02:20:03.840]  it and then magically it pops up and what a perfect place to vector Zika worldwide carried
[02:20:03.840 --> 02:20:09.200]  by humans through through sexual transmission or blood transmission they now admit it magically
[02:20:09.200 --> 02:20:14.480]  mutated but through the through the Olympics coming up in Brazil this is unprecedented
[02:20:14.480 --> 02:20:19.200]  yeah the thing is people can avoid toxic air if they want they can get an air purification
[02:20:19.200 --> 02:20:24.880]  system they can avoid toxic water and drink clean water but it's really hard to avoid
[02:20:24.880 --> 02:20:30.720]  parasites it's hard to avoid attacking organisms and that's where I see this going I mean I
[02:20:30.720 --> 02:20:35.320]  think a lot of the information that we put out there and a lot of the products that that
[02:20:35.320 --> 02:20:40.120]  we develop are specifically for that reason to protect you against the endocrine disrupting
[02:20:40.120 --> 02:20:44.960]  chemicals to protect you against all those chemicals and toxins but here here we have
[02:20:44.960 --> 02:20:50.360]  are with billions of people being affected with different types of harmful organisms
[02:20:50.360 --> 02:20:53.200]  and I want to be clear there's a reason the global has never let all these third world
[02:20:53.200 --> 02:20:56.800]  diseases and a lot of which they souped up and declassified that they aimed at the poor
[02:20:56.800 --> 02:21:01.360]  people folks from Brazil or the Middle East these are victims okay and I really feel sorry
[02:21:01.360 --> 02:21:03.640]  with the folks from Latin America because they're not trying to put beekeeper suits
[02:21:03.640 --> 02:21:07.640]  on women and cut their genitals off you know that's my issue with the Muslims is come on
[02:21:07.640 --> 02:21:11.880]  man keep well no my daughters will not be your your slave they're gonna drive cars they're
[02:21:11.880 --> 02:21:15.480]  gonna do what they want shut up call me a racist or anti-feminine if you want you will
[02:21:15.480 --> 02:21:19.720]  not put her in a freaking me suit now I'm sorry but anyways they're hitting those they've
[02:21:19.720 --> 02:21:24.240]  been caught the UN's been caught you know Peru injecting people with syphilis it wasn't
[02:21:24.240 --> 02:21:28.560]  just the black people or injecting them with other garbage or polio it's all come out you
[02:21:28.560 --> 02:21:33.760]  can go to the registration of the Zika virus it says Rockefeller Foundation and the year
[02:21:33.760 --> 02:21:41.080]  that they did it you cannot make any of this garbage up and it makes me want to throw up
[02:21:41.080 --> 02:21:45.720]  that these people are now pouring in and now the elites we know have gotten cures and
[02:21:45.720 --> 02:21:48.880]  treatments for themselves in case they get it and that's why they're about to let the
[02:21:48.880 --> 02:21:54.680]  full West enjoy the population reduction and things that they've been under as well you
[02:21:54.680 --> 02:21:59.080]  cannot make it up and I said the 50s it was 47 I was going from memory go ahead go ahead
[02:21:59.080 --> 02:22:06.080]  dr. group no I should apply for that 1.5 billion dollar reward that British is thinking about
[02:22:06.080 --> 02:22:12.080]  offering somebody that comes up with a cure for this new E. Coli and the fact that none
[02:22:12.080 --> 02:22:17.040]  of the antibiotics are working anymore I mean really if you just take a combination of silver
[02:22:17.040 --> 02:22:24.920]  oregano the x2 iodine and the living defense you pretty much are protecting yourself and
[02:22:24.920 --> 02:22:30.480]  boosting your immune system against any type I had three family members die in one month
[02:22:30.480 --> 02:22:35.120]  of this lung eating garbage the hospitals were all full it was barely in the news and
[02:22:35.120 --> 02:22:37.840]  a mystery almost was killing everybody the doctor said they've never seen this much
[02:22:37.840 --> 02:22:42.560]  death again it was a cover up of it and my dad had it for over a month two different
[02:22:42.560 --> 02:22:48.200]  antibiotics and helping was in bed and I literally forced him to drink close to two or three
[02:22:48.200 --> 02:22:52.000]  bottles of it in one week and he said that's bad for your kidneys that level which it is
[02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:55.760]  folks you don't take it much smaller dosages okay it's something like 30 parts per million
[02:22:55.760 --> 02:23:00.840]  silver bullet but he I dumped I think was three bottles down him knocked it out knocked
[02:23:00.840 --> 02:23:04.440]  it out nothing else was working so we're not saying it's a silver bullet but it's darn
[02:23:04.440 --> 02:23:09.880]  close to it yeah it's just I mean the thing is they don't want to go back to natural medicine
[02:23:09.880 --> 02:23:16.680]  they the the natural products that we've developed are specifically designed and have even been
[02:23:16.680 --> 02:23:22.960]  tested by the U.S. military to be very strong at protecting the body my uncle was dying
[02:23:22.960 --> 02:23:27.080]  two years ago all over the hospital they had silver sprays and silver creams and they were
[02:23:27.080 --> 02:23:32.720]  just going yes silver oh I mean they know now they know I tell you what you know just
[02:23:32.720 --> 02:23:38.080]  like Daniela Grace was on your show talking about all the prison systems you got to remember
[02:23:38.080 --> 02:23:42.760]  the prisoners are being tested on the soldiers are being tested on all over the world not
[02:23:42.760 --> 02:23:47.960]  just U.S. military but all military I remember a couple years from uncle died there about
[02:23:47.960 --> 02:23:52.880]  right down the road at Huntsville State Prison maximum security a bunch of people died of
[02:23:52.880 --> 02:23:56.560]  a mystery ailment it turned out there was secret testing at that place that was even
[02:23:56.560 --> 02:24:03.120]  in the Houston Chronicle I wonder man oh imagine what we don't know Dr. Group I mean I'm telling
[02:24:03.120 --> 02:24:09.000]  you there's thousands and millions of organisms cruising around in our system that are taking
[02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:14.640]  our nutrients reducing our immune system and the thing is doctors don't know they don't
[02:24:14.640 --> 02:24:18.760]  teach doctors in medical school about parasites and harmful organisms there's a reason why
[02:24:18.760 --> 02:24:22.880]  they don't teach them about that just like they don't teach doctors about the root cause
[02:24:22.880 --> 02:24:27.600]  of disease and how to eliminate all disease out there they don't want you to know about
[02:24:27.600 --> 02:24:32.480]  it the parasites and harmful organism testing in the biological I mean most of these things
[02:24:32.480 --> 02:24:39.240]  can be tracked back to U.S. military or bio weapon laboratories that were specifically
[02:24:39.240 --> 02:24:44.320]  designed even before the Cold War to use for biological disease they admit from a Nazi
[02:24:44.320 --> 02:24:51.800]  scientist off the coast of New York 1952 right the thing is if you're suffering from abdominal
[02:24:51.800 --> 02:24:58.040]  pain allergies I mean usually most of even like headaches anemia weakened immune system
[02:24:58.040 --> 02:25:06.680]  gut problems depression hair loss excess gas muscle pain nervousness I mean all these things
[02:25:06.680 --> 02:25:11.440]  weight gain mental brain fog let's talk about what's in living defense because nothing's
[02:25:11.440 --> 02:25:15.600]  a panacea but the stuff Mother Nature gave us is more and more folks admit and this what
[02:25:15.600 --> 02:25:19.560]  the elites are all into why is living defense so good tell us about all the stuff I said
[02:25:19.560 --> 02:25:24.440]  there's so many things that are in it right so if you look across the board what we what
[02:25:24.440 --> 02:25:29.360]  we wanted to do is try to attack as many different things and create wildcrafted black walnut
[02:25:29.360 --> 02:25:35.160]  green hole organic yep you have the name in there you have the organic clove by the organic
[02:25:35.160 --> 02:25:40.040]  wormwood you have enzyme blend in there and this is very important because a lot of these
[02:25:40.040 --> 02:25:46.240]  microorganisms and even going up to tape worms pin worms you have to disintegrate the lining
[02:25:46.240 --> 02:25:51.760]  I mean on viruses or protect themselves and so do bacteria protozoa and mycoplasms they
[02:25:51.760 --> 02:25:56.160]  have a protective shell that a lot of times the immune system can't even get into our
[02:25:56.160 --> 02:26:01.200]  own immune system especially since most people's immune system are weak anyway and they were
[02:26:01.200 --> 02:26:06.760]  actually things to make us weaker so we're a better host yeah exactly so we and in our
[02:26:06.760 --> 02:26:14.520]  body Hillary I'm acidic so we actually designed the living defense and put in a specific blend
[02:26:14.520 --> 02:26:20.800]  of enzymes which actually chew and eat through the lining of these different organisms to
[02:26:20.800 --> 02:26:25.520]  the living defense is amazing we've seen just tremendous reviews as a matter of fact the
[02:26:25.520 --> 02:26:33.480]  lady that was so sick for 10 or 15 years had called the other day been to 15 or 16 different
[02:26:33.480 --> 02:26:38.880]  doctors was on her deathbed she started doing the living defense she said it was a miracle
[02:26:38.880 --> 02:26:43.880]  product very wealthy lady saw the best doctors went to the best hospitals in the world no
[02:26:43.880 --> 02:26:48.680]  one could determine what was wrong with her this is going on with practically every single
[02:26:48.680 --> 02:26:53.480]  person that goes to a doctor with symptoms I can pretty much guarantee they have some
[02:26:53.480 --> 02:26:59.400]  level of parasites inside their body even the New York Times a few months ago said
[02:26:59.400 --> 02:27:06.160]  most cancer now link to the gut because the autoimmune system finally gives up and that
[02:27:06.160 --> 02:27:09.880]  that's why people aren't able to absorb any of the vitamins and minerals and as you said
[02:27:09.880 --> 02:27:15.720]  it's all the bad bacteria the parasites the yeast the fungus it's all in there and you're
[02:27:15.720 --> 02:27:20.400]  dying because your gut is dying and even the New York Times had all these big studies with
[02:27:20.400 --> 02:27:24.720]  the US government admitting it so at one side they're killing us but then they're good people
[02:27:24.720 --> 02:27:30.320]  compartmentalized getting reports out agreeing with you yeah I just I want to bring it to
[02:27:30.320 --> 02:27:37.640]  the public attention because anything we can do to help people anything we can do to educate
[02:27:37.640 --> 02:27:44.440]  people and to be aware it's it's just at this point in time it's going crazy it's everywhere
[02:27:44.440 --> 02:27:50.160]  in the news with the super bugs that are out there it's just a lot more than ever I mean
[02:27:50.160 --> 02:27:55.440]  you can actually trace back and there's been studies done on fossilized feces from the
[02:27:55.440 --> 02:28:01.760]  Vikings that showed that the Vikings suffered from parasites and if you even ancient Rome
[02:28:01.760 --> 02:28:07.360]  was infested with human parasites they they're doing analysis now on fossilized basically
[02:28:07.360 --> 02:28:11.920]  fossilized feces public schools and private schools are constantly sending letters home
[02:28:11.920 --> 02:28:15.560]  I talked to all these parents with all these weird gut parasites spread and all these third
[02:28:15.560 --> 02:28:21.240]  world parasites spreading now and it's just totally insane and how often should you take
[02:28:21.240 --> 02:28:25.280]  living defense I mean is it a regimen every day that's what I was doing until we ran out
[02:28:25.280 --> 02:28:29.520]  or do you do it heavier for certain cleansers what do you do daughter group well I do usually
[02:28:29.520 --> 02:28:34.960]  six weeks at a time because if you look at the life cycle of most parasites but they're
[02:28:34.960 --> 02:28:38.720]  it's six weeks from the time to kill the ones that are in there and then kill their their
[02:28:38.720 --> 02:28:44.200]  baby is when they exactly so you there it takes six weeks from the time they lay their eggs
[02:28:44.200 --> 02:28:47.800]  until they're an adult even if we politically defeat Hillary see they've laid so many eggs
[02:28:47.800 --> 02:28:53.840]  there'll be other generations of horrible criminals we have parasites you're right I
[02:28:53.840 --> 02:28:58.640]  mean we have parasites all over that attack us but the thing is you don't want your own

[02:35:15.440 --> 02:35:19.840]  know herpes just keeps coming back over and over again and then another article trump
[02:35:19.840 --> 02:35:25.440]  banned buzzfeed reporter from speech credentialed info wars info wars is the nation's leading
[02:35:25.440 --> 02:35:30.640]  conspiracy theory website which means we know what we're talking about but you know i mean
[02:35:30.640 --> 02:35:35.280]  i trust larry nickles and i and i love him but he was telling me last week actually on
[02:35:35.280 --> 02:35:39.200]  air he was saying it but then over the weekend and then monday i'm communicating directly
[02:35:39.200 --> 02:35:41.800]  to the trump people but i told him i don't want to meet with him was will make a big
[02:35:41.800 --> 02:35:47.080]  issue out of it as you know alex and there he's got a big speech coming up the week
[02:35:47.080 --> 02:35:52.520]  after next and i need to get vet their intel for him and i'm just like yesterday i'm like
[02:35:52.520 --> 02:35:56.040]  well larry we're too full today but let me get you on the next few days all right but
[02:35:56.040 --> 02:36:01.400]  they need it now alex and then trump comes out that night and goes my big speech next
[02:36:01.400 --> 02:36:08.280]  week and i'm like so uh okay well i know trump listens to the show so we'll try to line that
[02:36:08.280 --> 02:36:12.600]  up and communicate this way i'm not trying to sound big it's true it freaks me out the
[02:36:12.600 --> 02:36:17.000]  new york times comes out in two articles and goes info wars is the brain of trump that's
[02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:22.680]  not really true they just know we research we vet things we didn't come out first with the
[02:36:22.680 --> 02:36:28.040]  laraza connection to this judge daily caller did we went and looked up more put it out world
[02:36:28.040 --> 02:36:33.400]  net daily looked out more drudge linked to it the truth is we'll just go with the truth is
[02:36:33.400 --> 02:36:39.320]  this it's not rocket science and and and we're in to the world like we remember laurel and
[02:36:39.320 --> 02:36:43.000]  hughes and the communist generals and their names and the chinese generals and what happened
[02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:48.440]  to the white house and it was on c span and we want to make that news again because it's news
[02:36:49.480 --> 02:36:54.120]  like it was a russian spy when they were 20 and now they're going to be 70 or a chinese spy
[02:36:54.120 --> 02:37:00.360]  we'd be concerned no this was just 20 years ago or 18 years ago of course it's pertinent
[02:37:00.360 --> 02:37:05.640]  but it is true that our info gets to trump and i'll just leave it at that and
[02:37:06.440 --> 02:37:09.720]  anthony's yard he's a smart cookie i don't know it was a rhetorical question and i'm going to lian
[02:37:09.720 --> 02:37:15.480]  macadam but he asked me during the break because it because the don salazar ran and said look media
[02:37:15.480 --> 02:37:18.680]  matters is like writing about you 10 times a day it's like he's like there's like eight or nine
[02:37:18.680 --> 02:37:23.080]  articles here it's like everything you say what is going on and i see just and then anthony goes
[02:37:23.080 --> 02:37:27.640]  they'd be bankrupt if it wasn't for us all they cover is you and trump and drudge and i went
[02:37:27.640 --> 02:37:32.360]  anthony you know why he goes well because we're newsworthy or whatever i said yeah but this is
[02:37:32.360 --> 02:37:37.080]  run by the white house and the clinton's on record the former transition chief roboma runs it it's
[02:37:37.080 --> 02:37:42.040]  all full of clinton people clinton gives them directives so this is who they're scared of
[02:37:42.040 --> 02:37:46.280]  they're scared of drudge they're scared of trump they're scared of info wars they used to cover
[02:37:46.280 --> 02:37:53.240]  fox that's in their hip pocket now they cover us this is the enemy's list i am so proud of this
[02:37:53.240 --> 02:37:57.960]  this is like a congressional medal of honor having these traders that are funded by a nazi
[02:37:57.960 --> 02:38:05.800]  collaborator a war criminal their main funder i mean i i i am a static people say is it rough
[02:38:05.800 --> 02:38:12.280]  being attacked attacked i'd be like if a nambla came out against me by the way they had salon and
[02:38:12.280 --> 02:38:17.800]  pedophiles on there come out against me good i better have pedophiles coming out against me
[02:38:17.800 --> 02:38:28.920]  you know a man by his enemies i love it i like it love it like it love it i'm 18
[02:38:32.200 --> 02:38:36.840]  42 and feel like i'm 18 i'll tell you that right now feel better than i felt when i was 18 because
[02:38:36.840 --> 02:38:42.120]  now i know what it's all about and i'm into the zeitgeist i'm going in like a kamikaze into the
[02:38:42.120 --> 02:38:47.960]  new world order i love it i absolutely love not having fear because my only fear is that they're
[02:38:47.960 --> 02:38:53.480]  going to win you see that's a big secret right there being totally committed and being committed
[02:38:53.480 --> 02:38:58.360]  to the zeitgeist all the doors start opening up but then you got to be ready when you actually
[02:38:58.360 --> 02:39:04.760]  walk out on that final sand gladiatorial event because in this type of destiny usually don't
[02:39:04.760 --> 02:39:09.080]  make it all the way to the end but your spirit takes everybody else over the top and you got to
[02:39:09.080 --> 02:39:14.760]  be ready you got to be committed you got to the gods got to know that you have got that eye of the
[02:39:14.760 --> 02:39:22.680]  tiger and then all the doors open but just know you got to have the will to want to take on evil
[02:39:22.680 --> 02:39:28.200]  for the innocence it's not about who you are sure i come off as super aggressive and arrogant and
[02:39:28.200 --> 02:39:35.480]  wild no it's just confidence out of a suicide mission and i see that same confidence in donald
[02:39:35.480 --> 02:39:41.320]  trump and whoever he was before entering this crucible is is is only making him stronger
[02:39:41.960 --> 02:39:45.880]  all right we're gonna go to leon macadoo in 30 seconds i think she's in long beach i know it's
[02:39:45.880 --> 02:39:49.960]  a beautiful shot of her out there at the beach but this is amazing we're gonna be getting to all of
[02:39:49.960 --> 02:39:55.320]  this uh but i tell you leon you're getting demonized out there's you're being attacked that is just a
[02:39:55.320 --> 02:39:59.720]  mark of your courage as well all the stuff you've gone through oh i thought joe bigs was still there
[02:39:59.720 --> 02:40:03.960]  i don't know he's he's here i'm told so he's not at lunch let's try to get him in here as well
[02:40:03.960 --> 02:40:07.720]  he was out there earlier than you you've seen so much craziness leon you couldn't hardly find
[02:40:07.720 --> 02:40:12.200]  anybody that was voting for hillary but she still won but the new york daily news admits
[02:40:12.200 --> 02:40:17.240]  because she was a point about the super delegates what what is your takeaway from all of your last
[02:40:17.240 --> 02:40:21.800]  four or five days out there leon thanks alex yes we're actually here in huntington beach
[02:40:21.800 --> 02:40:27.640]  california experiencing the eerie aftermath of the possibility of a hillary clinton presidency
[02:40:27.640 --> 02:40:33.080]  as a woman are you feeling empowered right now i am feeling like we can do a whole lot better than
[02:40:33.080 --> 02:40:38.360]  that and i'm feeling very duped that i have to be proud oh she broke the glass ceiling actually
[02:40:38.360 --> 02:40:43.960]  math broke the glass ceiling for her it wasn't the will of the american people um with her
[02:40:43.960 --> 02:40:49.320]  secret super delegates that were tipping it in her favor before the race even had begun
[02:40:49.320 --> 02:40:54.120]  so uh i feel very duped and i don't want to get excited about that as a woman so i don't know
[02:40:54.760 --> 02:40:58.840]  what are you what are you sure i mean uh look look i would love to have a great black president
[02:40:58.840 --> 02:41:02.600]  that was a wonderful patriot that would just be prideful for everybody instead it's like the
[02:41:02.600 --> 02:41:06.920]  so-called black president doubles black unemployment's horrible i mean if i was a black person i would
[02:41:06.920 --> 02:41:10.920]  not want him to represent me right what has he done for the black community what's he done for
[02:41:10.920 --> 02:41:16.680]  anybody but globalist he goes to africa to fund more forced abortions basically and then he tells
[02:41:16.680 --> 02:41:21.400]  them they can't have recognition or cars right they can't evolve they can't improve their quality
[02:41:21.400 --> 02:41:26.040]  of life because then the world would tip over or whatever excuse he gave them it was really
[02:41:26.040 --> 02:41:31.080]  interesting listening to you talking to dr group about the life cycle of parasites as
[02:41:31.080 --> 02:41:37.000]  disgusting as that is to think it's actually so appropriate for what we've sort of learned here
[02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:41.960]  in california um last night i'm i'm not sure if you saw the video we put out about the democratic
[02:41:41.960 --> 02:41:47.480]  socialist plot to take over america revealed uh these were women who they've been long time
[02:41:48.040 --> 02:41:52.280]  political activists they kind of started the whole gay marriage thing here in california
[02:41:52.280 --> 02:41:57.560]  and the lady was just like seething yeah in fact set that up at a moment and we'll play that club
[02:41:57.560 --> 02:42:01.320]  in fact i meant to say that's one reason you're on amazing footage you got out in california
[02:42:01.320 --> 02:42:06.280]  was zimmerman yeah and i mean those these people we finally we went to several different polling
[02:42:06.280 --> 02:42:11.560]  locations and we did go to west hollywood it's mostly just a gay community there and that was
[02:42:11.560 --> 02:42:16.920]  where all of the hillary supporters were which is like how how have you even been duped what has she
[02:42:16.920 --> 02:42:23.160]  done for the gay community her husband was one of the people who reinforced uh the uh the doma
[02:42:23.160 --> 02:42:28.520]  so a defensive marriage act you know and then all of a sudden she evolved on the issue tell us tell
[02:42:28.520 --> 02:42:34.520]  us who these creatures are that you interviewed well uh there's one one video you can see hillary
[02:42:34.520 --> 02:42:39.480]  clinton's biggest fan and he is supposed to be out there every day he's getting people to come vote
[02:42:39.480 --> 02:42:45.320]  for hillary and he has absolutely no idea he's like oh the fbi they closed their case six months
[02:42:45.320 --> 02:42:51.480]  ago and that's just fine and tpp oh she didn't do that and you know and he's out here like drunkenly
[02:42:51.480 --> 02:42:57.800]  like slovenly oh look for hillary oh this is the future of the country yeah that's it you cannot
[02:42:57.800 --> 02:43:03.560]  overestimate or over exaggerate how slovenly dumb even their leadership is but their minions
[02:43:03.560 --> 02:43:07.800]  can hardly talk of every race color and creed what have they done to these people i'm serious i
[02:43:07.800 --> 02:43:13.000]  mean i thought we should make a pamphlet we hand out and that says are you a zombie yeah and it's
[02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:18.200]  like written for a five-year-old well getting back to the whole parasite the cycle of parasites
[02:43:18.200 --> 02:43:22.920]  so this woman you know she's talking about how like you know we're going to take over i'm a proud
[02:43:22.920 --> 02:43:28.600]  democratic socialist and hillary she's she's our gal you know she's going to push this through and
[02:43:29.560 --> 02:43:34.040]  whatever happens we can see with all these young bernie supporters who are just out here spouting
[02:43:34.040 --> 02:43:39.240]  off those talking points they are primed and ready to keep the lifecycle this parasitic
[02:43:39.240 --> 02:43:46.200]  lifestyle cycle going because they have been primed and programmed now for many years if not
[02:43:46.200 --> 02:43:51.160]  decades pushing through this democratic socialist agenda and they're so excited because they can
[02:43:51.160 --> 02:43:55.080]  finally see it about to happen with hillary no they finally got enough of the public that
[02:43:55.080 --> 02:44:02.520]  literally literally they say uh laces and shoes is going out because people don't like the time or
[02:44:02.520 --> 02:44:10.360]  don't know how just need some slip on here let's go ahead and play democratic socialist plot for
[02:44:10.360 --> 02:44:15.080]  america reveal that leon macadoo shot yesterday we'll go back to macadoo and ask about where is
[02:44:15.080 --> 02:44:19.800]  this mystery hillary's voter is she finally found some but they openly meant they stole it from
[02:44:19.800 --> 02:44:25.240]  i'm going to give you everything for free but most go ahead but seems to give them too much
[02:44:25.240 --> 02:44:29.800]  of the trillionaires money they just want to give chicken feed out so i guess sanders is better for
[02:44:29.800 --> 02:44:35.000]  the average socialist out there but let's go to this clip leon macadoo with info wars dot com i am
[02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:40.760]  here in west hollywood california and the polls are about 15 seconds from closing uh we're still
[02:44:40.760 --> 02:44:45.640]  waiting to see could bernie sanders potentially take california even though they've already called
[02:44:45.640 --> 02:44:51.240]  it for hillary clinton the map has made history the super delegates have decided tonight you can
[02:44:51.240 --> 02:45:02.680]  see they're counting down yay super delegate this is the key race here in california 400 plus
[02:45:02.680 --> 02:45:06.600]  delegates uh to be won here in california of course it's still too early to call
[02:45:06.600 --> 02:45:11.320]  but they've already called it late last night we're going to go find out from these women
[02:45:13.400 --> 02:45:17.880]  we would just like to know what what does the country have to look forward to with a hillary
[02:45:17.880 --> 02:45:25.560]  clinton presidency hillary clinton for president what does the country look like if she becomes
[02:45:25.560 --> 02:45:33.240]  president well first of all the country looks a lot more united instead of divided the country looks
[02:45:33.240 --> 02:45:43.080]  a lot less racist the country wakes up the morning she gets in with hope and uh and not fear she doesn't
[02:45:43.080 --> 02:45:49.400]  practice the politics of fear and i think it's great what is better than a wonderful strong
[02:45:49.400 --> 02:45:54.600]  experienced woman and so what do you want to say to all the young bernie supporters out there who
[02:45:54.600 --> 02:45:59.240]  have said that they're gonna go vote for trump rather than hillary clinton and they don't like
[02:45:59.240 --> 02:46:04.120]  her scandals they don't like the the kind of trail that's sort of following her how do you talk to
[02:46:04.120 --> 02:46:10.440]  those people and and make them overlook that my name is robin tyler i'm a democratic socialist
[02:46:10.440 --> 02:46:16.280]  i produced three marches on washington major marches with a million people and being a democratic
[02:46:16.280 --> 02:46:24.280]  socialist and having been an activist since the 60s i understand their excitement and i understand
[02:46:24.280 --> 02:46:31.720]  um their disappointment in not having the candidate get in but this is not about bernie saunders this
[02:46:31.720 --> 02:46:38.680]  is about a movement i have been in the anti-war movement the feminist movement the anti-racism
[02:46:38.680 --> 02:46:45.960]  movement and so what's great about them is rather than uh imploding our our movement and our democratic
[02:46:45.960 --> 02:46:51.640]  party what's great is they can use this instead of imploding exploding to be this fantastic
[02:46:51.640 --> 02:46:56.440]  stealing elections was good of course it is for communist this movement and i'm a democratic socialist
[02:46:56.440 --> 02:47:01.080]  you're coming this movement will run the country and i think that's great next term your tv video
[02:47:01.080 --> 02:47:06.200]  these are scary people the right wing has been getting her for 25 years she's not in jail she's
[02:47:06.200 --> 02:47:12.280]  never smiling and we're winning we're somebody now the mega banks and chinese generals with slave
[02:47:12.280 --> 02:47:18.120]  factories are in control the apple suicide net even from the left but i'm a mental plant sorry
[02:47:18.120 --> 02:47:23.960]  i'm a major activist and i'm for hillary clinton okay can we pull up the the death of the emperor
[02:47:23.960 --> 02:47:29.160]  from the dark crystals i want to show this lady's acting rollout makeup on uh leon i'm sorry uh the
[02:47:29.160 --> 02:47:35.000]  drudge report media goddess hillary is a media goddess and richard simons is transitioning
[02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:42.600]  into a woman i thought he always was right i'm sorry i'm sorry it's who cares i always thought
[02:47:42.600 --> 02:47:48.600]  he was funny uh but i can't work out now yeah singing into pics history making hillary clinton as
[02:47:48.600 --> 02:47:56.040]  glowing golden god they actually said that glow and she's uh all planned to blur it out and blaster
[02:47:56.040 --> 02:48:01.000]  with spotlights the christ goddess if this is a goddess i don't want anywhere near him
[02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:08.440]  marylum and roe a goddess leon macadoo but not not not here hillary i'm sorry go ahead uh go
[02:48:08.440 --> 02:48:12.440]  ahead there goddess oh well that's what i agree with i mean if you could see the look on that lady's
[02:48:12.440 --> 02:48:17.960]  face and she just was so sure to point out how she's a democratic socialist but hillary is the one
[02:48:17.960 --> 02:48:21.960]  and that is the whole point is bernie sanders was never even going to be president he it was all
[02:48:21.960 --> 02:48:28.040]  for the money and to push the the left even further into more progressive issues more
[02:48:28.040 --> 02:48:31.720]  progressive that's it they admit he was there to move it all the left and normalize it so she
[02:48:31.720 --> 02:48:37.880]  could look more conservative and now the buzzword is like they're gonna unite the country we won't
[02:48:37.880 --> 02:48:42.680]  be racist anymore we'll be and we've got reeducation centers for the people that don't want to
[02:48:42.680 --> 02:48:47.880]  actually in the army official files now exactly and that was what was so frightening just the
[02:48:47.880 --> 02:48:52.200]  look in her eyes and i have to report uh early in january when hillary clinton debbie waserman
[02:48:52.200 --> 02:48:56.840]  schultz couldn't tell the difference they couldn't express well what is the difference between a
[02:48:56.840 --> 02:49:02.040]  democrat and a socialist and they were just like well i'm not a socialist but what's the difference
[02:49:02.040 --> 02:49:06.680]  so i did a video on that and pointed out how if you go to the socialist of america the young
[02:49:06.680 --> 02:49:11.080]  socialists of america their website they talk about how you know what is a democratic or socialist
[02:49:11.080 --> 02:49:15.720]  and that they they linked up with a democratic party because they felt they were the ones who
[02:49:15.720 --> 02:49:20.520]  were going to be the most powerful to that's right and then if you watch these women uh
[02:49:21.240 --> 02:49:25.080]  you know when the mastermind's talking the other one's like in rapture when she talks about the
[02:49:25.080 --> 02:49:30.600]  sneak attack plan i mean these are whacked out loons at the one us to live like russia and
[02:49:30.600 --> 02:49:37.320]  venezuela are cuba these are whack jobs yeah and they are like so seething with power that in the
[02:49:37.320 --> 02:49:43.560]  next four years this is going to be running the country they're going to fall in line and we
[02:49:43.560 --> 02:49:47.400]  talked to some people out here on the beach and they're like yeah socialism it's great it's for
[02:49:47.400 --> 02:49:51.480]  the collective and not the individual and they don't even know what that means why are you against
[02:49:51.480 --> 02:49:57.960]  the golden goddess yeah well so the collective decides that we're going to gas the juice right
[02:49:57.960 --> 02:50:01.800]  and then they're like oh well that's not good the collective decides we're going to take all the
[02:50:01.800 --> 02:50:06.040]  middle classes from money that's okay yeah and that's what these people do you want to understand
[02:50:06.040 --> 02:50:11.400]  they think that oh we're unified let's all just get no the prosperity is all going out the window
[02:50:11.400 --> 02:50:16.200]  and a bunch of soft nobodies that don't even work to show up once a year to politically bend bang on
[02:50:16.200 --> 02:50:20.600]  pots and pans are not going to be given full control and they're so weak minded when we totally
[02:50:20.600 --> 02:50:25.400]  collapse they'll never even admit it because all they'll have a power trip even as their ceilings
[02:50:25.400 --> 02:50:30.840]  caved in like cuba right i mean we have got to stop this alex that was what was so frightening to
[02:50:30.840 --> 02:50:35.560]  me last night and just talking to these little socialists in the making it's frightening and we
[02:50:35.560 --> 02:50:38.760]  have got to turn this thing i don't know what they're putting the water on california those are the
[02:50:38.760 --> 02:50:44.200]  dumbest people and you look who rules them bunch of smiling loons you know about how they deceived
[02:50:44.200 --> 02:50:50.040]  everyone and how they're taking over and there's no election really what matters is our movement

[02:55:02.360 --> 02:55:08.120]  you'll ever be in your life i am fortunate enough you can say unfortunate enough to experience that
[02:55:08.120 --> 02:55:12.360]  a few times as all people that are in that situation a lot become addicted to it but i'll
[02:55:12.360 --> 02:55:19.160]  say i'll take that animating contest of the death battle over the zombiosis of just everything's
[02:55:19.160 --> 02:55:25.480]  mine i'm a victim i deserve stuff with these elites that are building space stations
[02:55:26.440 --> 02:55:31.880]  going oh yeah we'll give you some free stuff cupcakes when they literally see you as dead animals
[02:55:33.640 --> 02:55:37.160]  and they helped make you like this they helped set it up so you'd be like this
[02:55:37.160 --> 02:55:43.400]  i don't know who's worse quite frankly i guess the engineers but leon i tell you you know out
[02:55:43.400 --> 02:55:47.640]  there experiencing these people i know she's to be what you call more liberal so was i
[02:55:47.640 --> 02:55:52.120]  it's not just that i was younger i mean i like liberal ideas and but it's it's that they twist it
[02:55:52.120 --> 02:55:57.160]  all and it's all about being in control and like we don't have elections really it's our takeover
[02:55:57.160 --> 02:56:03.560]  our agenda and it's like really creepy weird old cult like women and then you know and the
[02:56:03.560 --> 02:56:08.360]  the hovington post came out and said basically kill donald trump attack his supporters they deserve it
[02:56:08.360 --> 02:56:17.320]  they're not human these are scary people folks but what's really scary is rolling over to them
[02:56:19.080 --> 02:56:22.600]  these people aren't going to run the nuclear reactors and do the dirty jobs and work hard
[02:56:22.600 --> 02:56:26.680]  they're gonna have things just going to collapse a bunch of i don't know what to even say anymore
[02:56:26.680 --> 02:56:32.440]  leon mac and do other other points we got a fresh horse on the flight coming in hard charger david
[02:56:32.440 --> 02:56:38.920]  knight what an amazing broadcast so far today but uh other points leon from the coast of california
[02:56:39.720 --> 02:56:44.120]  well i mean what do we do at this point alex because we can see where she is going with this
[02:56:44.120 --> 02:56:49.800]  they're going to the media who's already calling her the golden glowing goddess the goddess and
[02:56:49.800 --> 02:56:54.040]  everything trump says they're not going to do a little digging and understand the la raza
[02:56:54.040 --> 02:56:58.040]  connections there they don't even want to know who that is because let's not forget hillary clinton
[02:56:58.040 --> 02:57:04.440]  is considering one of the castro brothers for her vice presidency uh he he and his twin brother who
[02:57:04.440 --> 02:57:09.240]  was on obama's side their mom was one of the founding members of la raza so these are people
[02:57:09.240 --> 02:57:13.800]  they don't want you looking over in that direction they don't want you seeing this this judge's law
[02:57:13.800 --> 02:57:22.280]  firm is is is is is running a boycott campaign of trump yeah and it is like how ridiculous that
[02:57:22.280 --> 02:57:28.120]  he's untied trump how ridiculous that's preposterous whoo oh who could be biased and this is this is
[02:57:28.120 --> 02:57:33.320]  that time in the country when everyone's like how can a white police officer be fair to a black
[02:57:33.320 --> 02:57:37.880]  person or you know how can and so the new york told the new york time she said i as you know this
[02:57:37.880 --> 02:57:43.560]  latin woman can give him a better decision than white men exactly it's only okay if it's coming
[02:57:43.560 --> 02:57:47.640]  from the other side but that's what's gonna happen is that everything trump says from here on out
[02:57:47.640 --> 02:57:53.480]  they're going to make him sound like this total very cynical against hispanics and other groups
[02:57:53.480 --> 02:57:59.240]  and hispanics i mean our america are the future we're always here of the native americans it's
[02:57:59.240 --> 02:58:03.160]  ridiculous like you're hispanic you're mexican no you're a native american mixed with european
[02:58:03.160 --> 02:58:06.760]  you know it's like it's all this stupid debate and it's like don't you want to bill a rights
[02:58:06.760 --> 02:58:10.440]  constitution prosperity that's what people come here they're being forced to add all this race
[02:58:10.440 --> 02:58:15.640]  garbage and lies and bs and on the other side it is generating a bunch of white racism that was

[02:59:49.080 --> 02:59:58.040]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:59:58.040 --> 03:00:25.800]  we are on the march the empire is on the run alex jones and the gcm radio network yes awaken
[03:00:25.800 --> 03:00:31.560]  humanity is on the march the empire is on the run the problem is awakens humanities 30 40 percent
[03:00:31.560 --> 03:00:37.000]  the other 30 40 percent is totally mindless and another 20 30 percent just doesn't care
[03:00:39.320 --> 03:00:43.240]  but it was five percent or less than one of the military wars i'm not that worried about it but man
[03:00:44.520 --> 03:00:49.800]  and the good news is i'm not being stereotypical this is just what i've experienced the dumbest
[03:00:49.800 --> 03:00:55.800]  people are white people either some of the smartest awake folks are white people or but or also
[03:00:55.800 --> 03:01:00.920]  it's a paradox the dumbest are white trendies and yuppies and the hippies generation which had a
[03:01:00.920 --> 03:01:03.960]  lot of great ideas and you know i know a lot of old hippies that are the coolest the most
[03:01:03.960 --> 03:01:09.000]  away people out there but kind of the trendy modern hippie and then you've got super dumb
[03:01:09.000 --> 03:01:13.960]  hispanic super dumb black people i run into but now tell you that as a general group i've found
[03:01:13.960 --> 03:01:19.160]  hispanics more awake to the new world order and paranoid about stuff and informed than white people
[03:01:19.160 --> 03:01:22.680]  and a lot of black folks are awake but they still vote like you know 90 percent democratic
[03:01:22.680 --> 03:01:25.960]  though that's changing with trump and i'm not saying look how bad republicans are i mean i get
[03:01:25.960 --> 03:01:32.200]  why you wouldn't trust them it's just that i don't understand how it's supposedly there's all this
[03:01:32.200 --> 03:01:39.400]  white racism but then the people running the show are a bunch of just weird squatting white people
[03:01:39.400 --> 03:01:43.800]  and i'm kind of just digressing but look at bill o'reilly defense hillary says don't call her
[03:01:43.800 --> 03:01:50.200]  crooked on his show the clips up on info wars dot com i mean she's totally crooked what are they
[03:01:50.200 --> 03:01:54.200]  afraid of are they afraid that they'll bring up that he had to settle a sexual harassment case
[03:01:55.080 --> 03:01:58.440]  and by the way some of the tapes got released the transcripts before he settled
[03:01:58.440 --> 03:02:02.440]  where he said the most perverted pressure pressuring women to have sex that worked with him and
[03:02:02.440 --> 03:02:09.880]  calling him up like a creep and over and over and over again and then he had the nerve to go
[03:02:09.880 --> 03:02:13.880]  sexual predators online or a problem and cuts to a clip of me talking about corrupt police
[03:02:15.480 --> 03:02:20.360]  those are fighting words you piece of crap i mean i'm sorry bill o'reilly but you're a creep
[03:02:20.360 --> 03:02:24.440]  of course women don't want you so let's go to the clip of the pervert
[03:02:26.840 --> 03:02:32.440]  the surprise that uh crooked hillary wins in this case because of the sopranos no no no
[03:02:32.440 --> 03:02:37.480]  crooked hillary on this program drunken to do that because that's what he does not you by the

[03:03:41.000 --> 03:03:46.280]  rant about majelin and you know just so inspiring to just wake people up and there you explain it
[03:03:46.280 --> 03:03:51.800]  perfectly how they are trying to steal your humanity from you steal your ingenuity from you
[03:03:51.800 --> 03:03:57.080]  and tell you that justin biebler is the god and that's who you should worship and taking this away
[03:03:57.080 --> 03:04:01.880]  from everyone and you know i encourage everyone to go look at that rant set it as your alarm clock

[03:04:07.000 --> 03:04:13.640]  super inspiring for us today but i mean it's just it's really kind of scary when you see that yeah
[03:04:13.640 --> 03:04:19.400]  we've got these nitwits out here who are voting and you know with their idiocracy they're voting
[03:04:19.400 --> 03:04:24.200]  but then we're seeing that it doesn't even matter their idiotic votes don't even count and they're
[03:04:24.200 --> 03:04:28.840]  just gonna and they're actually happy about the fact that the superdelegates because it's their
[03:04:28.840 --> 03:04:34.360]  gal who won so it's fine this time around if the system's all corrupt we'll fix it next time around

[03:04:59.160 --> 03:05:02.200]  we'll see you when we get back you back can't wait it was thomas jefferson who once said that
[03:05:02.200 --> 03:05:06.520]  our country is now taking so steady of course as to show by what rodeo will pass to destruction to
[03:05:06.520 --> 03:05:11.560]  wit by consolidation of power first and then corruption it's necessary consequence jefferson
[03:05:11.560 --> 03:05:15.400]  was warning us about the global elite the one percent of the one percent consolidating the
[03:05:15.400 --> 03:05:19.880]  world's wealth and subverting the people's voice in government unfortunately we didn't heed his
[03:05:19.880 --> 03:05:24.520]  advice we now live in a neo feudalistic society in which we're treated as indentured servants who
[03:05:24.520 --> 03:05:28.680]  only exist to serve the needs of the establishment political office no longer represents the voice
[03:05:28.680 --> 03:05:33.160]  of the people but rather the initiation process politicians go through to gain acceptance into
[03:05:33.160 --> 03:05:37.480]  the aristocracy simply put we the people are responsible for civilization and culture yet
[03:05:37.480 --> 03:05:41.320]  we're suppressed by a tiny elite who have organized into criminal gangs that operate governments
[03:05:41.320 --> 03:05:46.040]  around the world we falsely believe that everything is simply black and white one extreme against the
[03:05:46.040 --> 03:05:50.760]  other conservative versus liberal but things will change once more of us realize this truth as thomas
[03:05:50.760 --> 03:05:55.560]  jefferson also said enlighten the people generally in tyranny and oppressions of body and mind will
[03:05:55.560 --> 03:06:01.160]  vanish like evil spirits at the dawn of day this is kit daniels within full wars dot com hey everyone

[03:09:47.080 --> 03:09:54.040]  potential defeat the globalist who want to shudder your mind your doorways to perception i want to
[03:09:54.040 --> 03:10:04.440]  see you truly live i want to see you truly be who you are i don't want my progeny who's coming

[03:10:17.560 --> 03:10:26.200]  the water the vaccines the food to turn us into a bunch of slugs a bunch of lobotomized sloths so
[03:10:26.200 --> 03:10:33.080]  they can control us it is a crime it is the most jealous envious greedy hateful sickening thing the
[03:10:33.080 --> 03:10:37.960]  new world order does and that's why i am so pleased to be committed in the fight against them that's
[03:10:37.960 --> 03:10:42.200]  why i don't care about my own life except i want to continue to live to fight them that's why i don't
[03:10:42.200 --> 03:10:51.320]  have fear i only have fear of myself and my flesh and not being up to the challenge and i ask you
[03:10:51.320 --> 03:10:55.640]  to look in the mirror and ask yourselves what are you doing in this time of great challenge
[03:10:56.200 --> 03:11:02.120]  what are you doing to unlock minds once you unlock a mind once you unlock somebody then
[03:11:02.120 --> 03:11:07.880]  they can unlock their soul we can't unlock a soul only god can do that but we can unlock minds
[03:11:07.880 --> 03:11:13.160]  and once the mind is unlocked once the intellect is turned on then comes the discernment then comes
[03:11:13.160 --> 03:11:20.120]  the awakening of the soul then comes true enlightenment and empowerment so the globalists
[03:11:20.120 --> 03:11:28.680]  seek to make you a bunch of jealous stunted weak backstabbing gibbering demons all of us have the
[03:11:28.680 --> 03:11:34.520]  lower elements and the higher we must strive for the higher stay with us all right that's alex
[03:11:34.520 --> 03:11:40.360]  jones great rant about justin beaver and the people in society that are being dumbed down by
[03:11:40.360 --> 03:11:46.280]  this culture i'm david night this is the fourth hour the alex jones broadcast and i'm still
[03:11:46.280 --> 03:11:51.160]  picturing as i'm watching alex and his passion i'm still picturing him in the ring with bill o'reilly
[03:11:51.160 --> 03:11:57.240]  and two ninja midgets i would pay to see that and i would lay a side bet on alex they could throw
[03:11:57.240 --> 03:12:03.560]  justin beaver in there too as well i'd still bet on alex with all four of them you know this is
[03:12:03.560 --> 03:12:09.800]  this is where we are though folks when we look at the arrogance of bill o'reilly saying don't call
[03:12:09.800 --> 03:12:16.520]  hillary clinton crooked really come on the transparency of the suck up i'm with her media
[03:12:16.520 --> 03:12:22.440]  that pretends that they are conservative republicans i mean it's not just the people like paul ryan
[03:12:22.440 --> 03:12:27.480]  we've seen this that they work hand in glove with each other many of these people in fox news
[03:12:27.480 --> 03:12:31.880]  here's hu hu it okay you saw him in one of the debates so he's got a radio show
[03:12:32.680 --> 03:12:38.760]  the hill says the g.o.p should change their convention rules to drop trump and i'm looking
[03:12:38.760 --> 03:12:45.960]  at this i'm thinking what arrogance what arrogance and we just looked at the massive increase in
[03:12:45.960 --> 03:12:51.880]  votes a record number of votes that uh uh trump has gotten this time i think one and a half million
[03:12:51.880 --> 03:12:57.560]  votes higher than the previous record you look at the fact that the votes up 40 percent over
[03:12:57.560 --> 03:13:02.680]  the previous record you see that hillary is crashing 30 less in california than she did
[03:13:03.560 --> 03:13:10.040]  the last time she ran in 2008 and he has the audacity as the hill calls him this influential
[03:13:10.040 --> 03:13:15.880]  conservative radio host yeah he's influential because he gets supported by the establishment
[03:13:15.880 --> 03:13:20.360]  that supports these establishment republicans these establishment neocon media and you know
[03:13:20.360 --> 03:13:26.840]  that the never trump establishment is really going through their bench pretty quickly national
[03:13:26.840 --> 03:13:33.080]  reviews been thoroughly discredited uh you had um glenn beck thoroughly discredited you got bill
[03:13:33.080 --> 03:13:38.920]  crystal who has a laughing stock now it's just a week ago wasn't just a week ago that he came out
[03:13:38.920 --> 03:13:44.680]  and said we're going to have a real credible independent candidate uh to run and uh then a
[03:13:44.680 --> 03:13:49.800]  couple days later it was some unknown writer from his own publication the weekly standard
[03:13:49.800 --> 03:13:55.640]  and remember you spell that weekly with an a because that's what they put out and he also
[03:13:55.640 --> 03:14:01.720]  wrote for the thoroughly discredited now national review david french and then he thought about it
[03:14:01.720 --> 03:14:06.920]  for a week and he says i prayed about it and i guess he realized he didn't have a prayer he's out
[03:14:07.480 --> 03:14:12.920]  it wasn't even uh reasonable for him to get in at this point there's a thing called ballot access
[03:14:12.920 --> 03:14:17.880]  these people don't even seem to understand what that is but of course they're used to the rules
[03:14:17.880 --> 03:14:23.160]  being waived for them just like they waived the rules for john casick we saw this many times we're
[03:14:23.160 --> 03:14:28.680]  working to get on the ballot with a libertarian party that uh you would have a republican who
[03:14:28.680 --> 03:14:33.800]  didn't file and it would be a predominantly democrat district they say well we're not even
[03:14:33.800 --> 03:14:38.200]  bothered to put anybody up against this person and then the libertarians got on the ballot and ran
[03:14:38.200 --> 03:14:42.600]  somebody and after the deadline was passed the republicans say oh wait a minute we don't want
[03:14:42.600 --> 03:14:46.200]  to uh not be on the ballot so they would go into the judge and they'd say well you know we missed
[03:14:46.200 --> 03:14:49.560]  the deadline and you got all these rules and everything but can't you just change the rules for
[03:14:49.560 --> 03:14:53.720]  us they would do it every time they'll never do it for an independent they'll never do it for a
[03:14:53.720 --> 03:15:00.280]  third party only for the two establishment parties and that's what we're seeing in the way that they
[03:15:00.280 --> 03:15:05.000]  rigged this election for bernie sanders and trump called him on it that's a great thing and he's
[03:15:05.000 --> 03:15:10.520]  going to call him on it if they rig the election but it hasn't stopped people like hu hu it calling
[03:15:10.520 --> 03:15:15.960]  for them to rig the election he says i think the party ought to change the nominee he thinks still
[03:15:15.960 --> 03:15:21.320]  at this point got to get rid of trump at the convention he's still calling for this kind of
[03:15:21.320 --> 03:15:25.000]  underhanded treatment he said because we're going to get killed with this nominee they ought to get
[03:15:25.000 --> 03:15:31.080]  together and let the convention decide how many times are they going to go down this narrative
[03:15:31.080 --> 03:15:36.920]  they never give it up and look we need to talk about these delegates and we need to see what's
[03:15:36.920 --> 03:15:41.720]  they need to understand that uh they're not going to get away with this people need to make it clear
[03:15:41.720 --> 03:15:47.960]  to them they still think they can get away with this this neo these neocons who are these delegates
[03:15:47.960 --> 03:15:53.720]  where do they come from who are they loyal to think about the electoral college delegates for
[03:15:53.720 --> 03:16:00.440]  example who are these guys well whenever you run and and again you have to win the state uh remember
[03:16:00.440 --> 03:16:06.200]  ross perot got 20 of the popular vote but he didn't get a single electoral college delegate because
[03:16:06.200 --> 03:16:11.480]  they're awarded on a winner take all basis state by state and that's a good there's a good reason
[03:16:11.480 --> 03:16:16.040]  for that too folks uh we can talk about that some other time let's talk about just who these
[03:16:16.040 --> 03:16:24.760]  delegates are when you run as a republican as a democrat as a third party candidate you would
[03:16:24.760 --> 03:16:29.240]  submit a list of who your electoral college delegates are going to be so like in north
[03:16:29.240 --> 03:16:34.760]  carolina we had i think it was 12 congressional districts so you would get one uh delegate for
[03:16:34.760 --> 03:16:38.840]  each of those congressional districts i was on the list in case the libertarian one in north
[03:16:38.840 --> 03:16:46.120]  carolina and if that had happened they would have sent 12 people that the party had nominated
[03:16:46.680 --> 03:16:51.080]  that were going to be loyal to them and they would go to the convention it's interesting i think it
[03:16:51.080 --> 03:16:59.080]  was back in 1976 uh they had uh the libertarians had a guy who was a republican elector i think
[03:16:59.080 --> 03:17:02.600]  he was from california he was a guy who was a producer a little house on the prairie roger
[03:17:02.600 --> 03:17:08.920]  mcbride uh he's descended from laura engel wilders and rose wilder lane who wrote the book
[03:17:08.920 --> 03:17:15.160]  and he went to the electoral college as a republican elector he was supposed to cast a vote
[03:17:16.040 --> 03:17:21.400]  and i guess who was it in 76 ford i think anyway he didn't vote for the republican instead he cast
[03:17:21.400 --> 03:17:26.200]  a vote for the libertarian party and they registered that because these people can do that now
[03:17:26.200 --> 03:17:33.400]  now you're going to be completely uh uh exiled from any political activity of that party of
[03:17:33.400 --> 03:17:37.720]  course forever that ends all your connection then but that's the only penalty i mean there's not any
[03:17:37.720 --> 03:17:42.440]  law that prevents that so people can do that even at the electoral college and then when you get to
[03:17:42.440 --> 03:17:47.160]  the actual GOP convention as we've seen they will have these elections and they say well
[03:17:47.160 --> 03:17:52.440]  trump got x number of delegates and cruz got x number of delegates and then you find out that
[03:17:52.440 --> 03:17:58.200]  cruz goes in and he gets to pick the delegates who are going to go who are loyal to him instead of
[03:17:58.200 --> 03:18:03.000]  delegates who are loyal to trump and it's not done like the electoral college it isn't done
[03:18:03.000 --> 03:18:08.040]  where you go into each individual state and trump says okay you know there's 50 delegates
[03:18:08.040 --> 03:18:11.400]  are going to go to the convention here's my list of 50 people that i know are going to be
[03:18:11.400 --> 03:18:17.160]  loyal to me and then cruz comes in with his list and they say okay well you got 30 delegates uh
[03:18:17.160 --> 03:18:23.160]  trump so uh you know which which 30 of the 50 that do you want to go no they don't do it that way
[03:18:23.160 --> 03:18:29.640]  they hold a separate secret election that's the way the republicans try to rig the election and so
[03:18:29.640 --> 03:18:35.000]  you got all these guys now who they say they're going to be bound to trump on the first thing but
[03:18:35.000 --> 03:18:41.320]  you know you still gotta you heal it you heal it who maybe he uh doesn't understand what the process
[03:18:41.320 --> 03:18:47.320]  is but he's still calling on these people to not listen to the voters don't listen to the voters
[03:18:47.320 --> 03:18:51.720]  we got a record number of voters who have voted for donald trump he's brought in people
[03:18:51.720 --> 03:18:55.480]  who are independents people who've never voted before people who are from the other party the
[03:18:55.480 --> 03:19:01.320]  democrats but ignore that because we the establishment that hu hu it works for don't
[03:19:01.320 --> 03:19:07.160]  like him we don't like him so we're going to throw that out just as george will had said in the past
[03:19:07.160 --> 03:19:14.520]  so amazing arrogance continuing to this point where what trump's got 1500 or something under the only
[03:19:14.520 --> 03:19:21.160]  1200 and so that he needed uh hundreds more than he needs millions of votes more than they've ever
[03:19:21.160 --> 03:19:27.160]  had and yet it's not good enough for the neocon mouthpieces and this is this is what we are up
[03:19:27.160 --> 03:19:31.400]  against and we're also up against hillary clinton and this is going to be interesting we got a
[03:19:31.400 --> 03:19:36.200]  story that's up on info wars dot com we'll talk about when we come back hillary in 2006 says the
[03:19:36.200 --> 03:19:42.920]  us needs a physical barrier to keep us mexicans out so we're going to go into that and then
[03:19:42.920 --> 03:19:48.360]  the next segment we're going to talk about bill de berg and something called the precariat
[03:19:48.360 --> 03:19:52.200]  haven't heard that word before have you but it's all the rage in bill de berg they're worried
[03:19:52.200 --> 03:19:56.520]  about this dangerous class of people they've created with their globalism stay with us

[03:24:20.440 --> 03:24:25.800]  fourth hour i'm gonna go back to hillary clinton and we have a new exclusive article
[03:24:25.800 --> 03:24:33.000]  at info wars dot com from roger stone about her university scandal and it is huge compared to
[03:24:33.000 --> 03:24:37.000]  donald trump's before i get back to that i want to let you know that we have living defense
[03:24:37.560 --> 03:24:44.040]  back in stock at info wars life dot com it has been out of stock for a very long time we have as
[03:24:44.040 --> 03:24:48.520]  we pointed out on the website nine out of ten people are infested with harmful organisms
[03:24:48.520 --> 03:24:54.200]  once these organisms have made it in your body they steal nutrients they release toxic waste
[03:24:54.200 --> 03:24:59.480]  this is a way to cleanse your body uh living defense is now back in stock at info wars life
[03:24:59.480 --> 03:25:05.880]  dot com it uses organic herbs and enzymes to help naturally cleanse harmful organisms from the body
[03:25:05.880 --> 03:25:10.840]  read the reviews at info wars life dot com see why it sold out so quickly and again you can find
[03:25:10.840 --> 03:25:17.560]  that back in stock after a very long absence at info wars life dot com now real quickly as a preface
[03:25:17.560 --> 03:25:27.880]  before i talk about this uh story here the hypocrisy of cricket hillary and it's nowhere
[03:25:27.880 --> 03:25:32.600]  better than in this article here that we've got up at info wars dot com hillary in 2006 the u.s
[03:25:32.600 --> 03:25:37.800]  needs physical barrier to keep mexicans out but of course as they point out it's only racist
[03:25:37.800 --> 03:25:43.240]  when donald trump says that and we have it on video she's speaking to the council on foreign
[03:25:43.240 --> 03:25:48.520]  relations in 2006 because they had a different way of handling it back then right now they've
[03:25:48.520 --> 03:25:54.760]  got uh they've embraced open borders uh bringing in people to bring down our economy so now it's
[03:25:54.760 --> 03:25:58.840]  all changed you know they've she's gotten a new memo from the cfr and they're doing it a little
[03:25:58.840 --> 03:26:03.080]  bit differently now but you know this was the conventional wisdom of the globalist back then
[03:26:03.080 --> 03:26:08.760]  and hillary is saying well the policies of mexico are quote this is what she says pushing migration
[03:26:08.760 --> 03:26:14.200]  north across our border unquote she says we need to and listen to this secure our borders
[03:26:14.200 --> 03:26:20.280]  hillary clinton actually said secure our borders you won't hear say that in 2016 10 years later
[03:26:20.280 --> 03:26:25.960]  and she says and we need to secure our borders with physical barriers and we need tougher
[03:26:25.960 --> 03:26:32.040]  employer sanctions for those who hire illegals we need to deport those who have committed
[03:26:32.040 --> 03:26:39.000]  transgressions deport is her word committed transgressions that's something she said physical
[03:26:39.000 --> 03:26:45.080]  barriers she said that but that was 10 years ago and now if we see the need for that if we got a
[03:26:45.080 --> 03:26:50.600]  candidate like donald trump who sees the need for that he's racist and so are we and of course
[03:26:51.160 --> 03:26:55.640]  we are going to see a lot of these types of things coming out from the secret service people that
[03:26:55.640 --> 03:27:02.760]  have worked for her as we had a caller last night who called in and said she and her other
[03:27:02.760 --> 03:27:08.200]  military friends who went to see 13 hours a story about Benghazi were so disturbed by it
[03:27:08.760 --> 03:27:15.480]  that they just were speechless as they left the the movie and they huddled together and
[03:27:15.480 --> 03:27:20.680]  just prayed outside the outside the movie theater they're so disturbed by the criminality
[03:27:20.680 --> 03:27:27.800]  and the cold sociopathic attitude of hillary clinton and the other people who made those
[03:27:27.800 --> 03:27:34.200]  decisions to stand down and of course we've got the secret service revelations that are coming
[03:27:34.200 --> 03:27:40.680]  out and we've got an article up on info wars dot com right now a quote from ron kesler who is an
[03:27:40.680 --> 03:27:45.320]  investigative reporter for the washington post secret service agent says good morning to hillary
[03:27:45.320 --> 03:27:51.480]  she responds to two words guess what those two words are f off can you imagine that the people
[03:27:51.480 --> 03:27:57.400]  who are tasked with laying their lives down to protect you and you walk out and one of them
[03:27:57.400 --> 03:28:03.720]  says good morning ma'am and you say to that person who has pledged to protect your life
[03:28:03.720 --> 03:28:11.320]  with his she responds by saying f off that's the hillary clinton that the people around her know
[03:28:11.320 --> 03:28:17.400]  that's the hillary clinton you're going to know by the time this campaign is out because no matter
[03:28:17.400 --> 03:28:22.760]  how much the hu-hu it's and the bill o'reilly's want to cover it up it's going to come out the

[03:33:45.800 --> 03:33:53.240]  on this wednesday june 8 2016 i was just talking about the exclusive story we have at info wars
[03:33:53.240 --> 03:33:58.600]  dot com by roger stone media ignores clinton university scandal that is worse than trump
[03:33:58.600 --> 03:34:05.320]  university this is a school where they had the students run up 750 million dollars worth of
[03:34:05.320 --> 03:34:10.520]  debt 750 million dollars worth of debt high pressure tactics to get them to enroll in this
[03:34:11.080 --> 03:34:19.160]  bill clinton took a lavish salary and they had a 50 percent graduation rate now i'm telling you
[03:34:19.160 --> 03:34:25.320]  this isn't because they can't handle the calculus and the math courses here okay because they can't
[03:34:25.320 --> 03:34:31.320]  handle the clinton calculations of putting them under astronomical debt okay i'm sure this is not
[03:34:31.320 --> 03:34:36.040]  an academically rigorous standard here that's not the reason for the high attrition rate
[03:34:37.640 --> 03:34:41.560]  this is a this is a very detailed article you need to take a look at this again it's
[03:34:41.560 --> 03:34:47.960]  exclusively at info wars dot com an article by roger stone really laying out this clinton
[03:34:47.960 --> 03:34:53.160]  university scandal in detail that we haven't seen before so this is an article that really
[03:34:53.160 --> 03:34:58.680]  needs to go viral so pass that around read that pass that around we need to get people to understand
[03:34:58.680 --> 03:35:03.160]  what a crook these people are because we're gonna have people like bill o'reilly on fox news saying
[03:35:03.160 --> 03:35:08.200]  don't talk to us about hillary clinton being a crook she can't be a crook she can't be racist
[03:35:08.200 --> 03:35:13.000]  even though she called for the same policies 10 years ago yeah we need to get a physical barrier
[03:35:13.560 --> 03:35:17.400]  mexico is driving people into this country we need sanctions against employers we need to
[03:35:17.400 --> 03:35:22.840]  deport them all these things that they're saying that's racist racist racist she was saying them
[03:35:22.840 --> 03:35:28.600]  all 10 years ago and we have the video you can run hillary but you can't hide we got a lot of video
[03:35:28.600 --> 03:35:32.360]  it's all over the place it's starting to surface from some of the more obscure places like the
[03:35:32.360 --> 03:35:37.960]  council on foreign relations those buddies of yours so that's going to come out now i want to
[03:35:37.960 --> 03:35:42.680]  talk about bill de berg when we look at the bill de berg meeting and what their agenda is according
[03:35:42.680 --> 03:35:46.600]  to bill de berg they say it's going to be things like current events it's kind of vague we know
[03:35:46.600 --> 03:35:50.440]  that's going to be brexit and the immigration crisis and that sort of thing because they do
[03:35:50.440 --> 03:35:55.960]  talk about europe the migration growth reform vision unity so of course they're going to be talking
[03:35:55.960 --> 03:36:01.240]  about brexit and immigration issues and then the usual stuff you would expect like china middle east
[03:36:01.240 --> 03:36:07.000]  russia us political landscape the elections in other words cyber security that's been there for
[03:36:07.000 --> 03:36:12.520]  a while geopolitics of energy you know what's going on with oil you know this is of course you're
[03:36:12.520 --> 03:36:17.560]  going to have those things but then this stuck out something i hadn't seen before number nine
[03:36:18.120 --> 03:36:23.800]  the precariat and the middle class precariat well that's a new word to me i don't really know what
[03:36:23.800 --> 03:36:30.040]  that is i started looking at it and it turns out that there is a new book uh that well not a new
[03:36:30.040 --> 03:36:34.120]  book but it's it's something that is really taken them by storm it actually came out two years ago
[03:36:34.120 --> 03:36:40.600]  it's by a london economist uh guy standing and the book is titled the precariat and the subtitle
[03:36:40.600 --> 03:36:48.120]  is the new dangerous class those how they're going to control all these people whose lives
[03:36:48.680 --> 03:36:55.160]  they have ruined with their globalist policies they have to understand you know not only they're
[03:36:55.160 --> 03:36:59.240]  not going to directly talk about the brexit and put that on there but they need to understand
[03:36:59.240 --> 03:37:03.160]  what they have done to people and how they're going to control us and so he's got a plan for this
[03:37:03.160 --> 03:37:08.520]  and i want to talk about that before i do real quickly i want to just take a quick look at how
[03:37:08.520 --> 03:37:13.640]  the mainstream media is now not only covering bill de berg but how they cover it i thought it was
[03:37:13.640 --> 03:37:17.880]  kind of interesting because an article from uh cmbc bill de berg the world's most powerful
[03:37:18.440 --> 03:37:23.880]  flock to an annual secret meeting well you know one of the reasons it was secret was because
[03:37:24.520 --> 03:37:30.440]  outlets like cmbc wouldn't report it or places like the wall street journal even though they
[03:37:30.440 --> 03:37:34.840]  would send reporters there and of course we got peggy noona and other people bloomberg is there
[03:37:34.840 --> 03:37:40.600]  uh all these reporters mainstream media they go there but they don't report on it the owners of
[03:37:40.600 --> 03:37:44.680]  the paper will go but they don't report on it reporters will go they don't report on it so it's
[03:37:44.680 --> 03:37:50.200]  a secret and if you report it on it your laugh that there's that all these conspiracy theorists
[03:37:50.200 --> 03:37:55.400]  you know just like they laughed at everybody and and it was amazing the rapidity of which
[03:37:55.400 --> 03:38:01.960]  this all got reversed as i've pointed out before we have talked for so long about the missing
[03:38:01.960 --> 03:38:09.400]  classified 28 pages of the 9-11 report and we've had high power politicians who are on the 9-11
[03:38:09.400 --> 03:38:13.960]  commission who for 15 years have been trying to get people to pay attention to this and this needs
[03:38:13.960 --> 03:38:19.800]  to be released we've had walter jones on multiple times talking about it uh and we couldn't get
[03:38:19.800 --> 03:38:23.960]  any traction with anybody they would just say oh you know it's not going that's a conspiracy
[03:38:23.960 --> 03:38:28.760]  theory conspiracy theory and then donald trump brought it up and the national review said he
[03:38:28.760 --> 03:38:33.240]  sounds like an alex jones caller in the debate because he's talking about the secret 28 pages
[03:38:33.240 --> 03:38:39.640]  but then it got traction isn't that interesting it got traction and now 9-11 is back on the table
[03:38:39.640 --> 03:38:44.280]  and when people realize there's a cover-up when people realize they've been lied to they say well
[03:38:44.280 --> 03:38:49.240]  what else have you been lying to us about and then that gives us a chance to talk about the real
[03:38:49.240 --> 03:38:55.880]  lie the official 9-11 report and that lets this whole thing start to unravel but we get back to
[03:38:55.880 --> 03:39:00.600]  bill de berg all these people who've said you know conspiracy theory conspiracy theory they keep now
[03:39:00.600 --> 03:39:05.320]  they're laying it out and they're telling you the same types of stuff that we have told you in
[03:39:05.320 --> 03:39:09.560]  the past over the years there's been numerous rumors of career launches and future presidents
[03:39:09.560 --> 03:39:15.720]  decided at bill de berg this is cnbc saying this mainstream media i thought that was a conspiracy
[03:39:15.720 --> 03:39:20.600]  theory they said bill clinton was a conference attendee in 1991 as a mere governor of arkansas
[03:39:20.600 --> 03:39:25.240]  a year before he was elected u.s president tony blair was only a shadow minister when he got his
[03:39:25.240 --> 03:39:31.160]  invitation in 1993 and of course you know they they quote the independent because the independent
[03:39:31.160 --> 03:39:36.120]  saying that too now okay then they go on to talk about all the people that are there people from
[03:39:36.120 --> 03:39:42.280]  shell dutch banks semen's henry kissinger former head of the european commissioner's commission
[03:39:42.280 --> 03:39:49.000]  is there also the head of the imf and also the world economic forum and then the king of the
[03:39:49.000 --> 03:39:58.120]  netherlands okay all this stuff there so then you get to slate who was just last week calling
[03:39:58.120 --> 03:40:03.960]  alex jones a wild eyed conspiracy theorist and now they talk about the bill de berg blackout but
[03:40:03.960 --> 03:40:09.080]  wait a minute slate but but i thought it was a conspiracy theory i thought all this stuff
[03:40:09.080 --> 03:40:13.240]  that we cover you know about the 9 11 cover up and bill de berg and all that that was just a
[03:40:13.240 --> 03:40:17.560]  conspiracy theory wasn't a slate even they are coming in on this i think it's really funny and
[03:40:17.560 --> 03:40:23.160]  again they go down with bill clinton tony blair they talk about john carrey and how he
[03:40:24.440 --> 03:40:30.360]  made john edwards his vice presidential pick after he impressed attendees at a bill de berg meeting
[03:40:30.920 --> 03:40:36.920]  and so forth and so on they say the meeting of 120 world figures probably constitute some kind of
[03:40:36.920 --> 03:40:42.120]  news yet to be fair to the mainstream press it's tough to report from a private gathering that's
[03:40:42.120 --> 03:40:49.560]  locked down tight by professional security yeah so don't even try okay but we do we go there we
[03:40:49.560 --> 03:40:54.520]  show you what it is we show you the military the police that are out there it's kind of
[03:40:54.520 --> 03:41:01.080]  yes like the guy that rob do was talking to with alex rob do tried to get the german
[03:41:01.880 --> 03:41:05.720]  military who's guarding these people to talk to him they wouldn't talk to him they wouldn't come
[03:41:05.720 --> 03:41:11.240]  over to the gate and he they saw him over at the gate talking to some german citizens so he walked
[03:41:11.240 --> 03:41:15.560]  over there immediately the guy clammed up and walked away but rob started talking to the elderly
[03:41:15.560 --> 03:41:22.440]  couple that was there started explaining it to them and it's really hard to not believe somebody
[03:41:22.440 --> 03:41:25.800]  when you say yeah it's 120 of the most powerful people in the world are meeting here and they
[03:41:25.800 --> 03:41:31.160]  can see the military protecting this place and the military will only say it it's just an event
[03:41:31.160 --> 03:41:36.280]  we won't use the word bill de berg can't say that can't say the word bill de berg it's secret
[03:41:36.280 --> 03:41:42.520]  but even salon even though they they can't ignore it anymore see because we've put it out there
[03:41:43.240 --> 03:41:49.640]  we show it and just as this german couple is seeing it there that's why we go there
[03:41:49.640 --> 03:41:52.760]  we say yeah they say this isn't happening but here it is and we've got some
[03:41:54.440 --> 03:42:01.480]  releases of previous meetings where we can see early on the first meeting they were planning
[03:42:01.480 --> 03:42:07.400]  the common currency the euro there were other meetings where they planned the european union
[03:42:08.280 --> 03:42:12.360]  creating a united states of europe but it was the euro was first introduced at a bill de berg
[03:42:12.360 --> 03:42:18.840]  meeting and of course this isn't the only group and salon kind of mocks it yes they all right
[03:42:18.840 --> 03:42:24.120]  it's a secret meeting but you know there's still a lot of crazy conspiracies out there about this
[03:42:24.120 --> 03:42:30.760]  and they come in and say well what's going on you know where are the japanese the indians the chinese
[03:42:30.760 --> 03:42:35.480]  the brazilians australians south koreans are they so timid that they stand aside and let the
[03:42:35.480 --> 03:42:42.680]  bill de bergers have their way with the world without even making a peep oh so it must not really be
[03:42:42.680 --> 03:42:50.360]  a very important meeting this is a meeting for european and north american politicians and they
[03:42:50.360 --> 03:42:54.760]  have multiple meetings they're happening every couple of months all over the place this is one
[03:42:54.760 --> 03:42:59.480]  of a lot of these elite meetings that we point that out every time we talk about bill de berg
[03:42:59.480 --> 03:43:04.120]  they still don't get it they still don't understand what this is about and they they can't ignore it
[03:43:04.120 --> 03:43:09.800]  but they do want to talk about it so let's talk about what they're going to be covering at bill de
[03:43:09.800 --> 03:43:15.160]  berg just from their own admission they're going to be talking about this idea of the precariat
[03:43:15.160 --> 03:43:21.640]  and this is a term that was created by guy standing he's a uk economist his book the precariat came out
[03:43:21.640 --> 03:43:27.480]  in 2014 as i mentioned before the subtitle is the new dangerous class and here i'm going to read
[03:43:27.480 --> 03:43:32.600]  a little bit of this description on amazon.com to give you an idea of what this is about guy
[03:43:32.600 --> 03:43:40.040]  standing warns that the rapid growth of the precariat is producing instabilities in society
[03:43:40.040 --> 03:43:45.560]  it is dangerous it's a dangerous class of people because it's internally divided leading to the
[03:43:45.560 --> 03:43:51.000]  villainization of migrants and other vulnerable groups its members may be susceptible to the
[03:43:51.000 --> 03:43:57.080]  siren calls of political extremism and he argues for new politics in which redistribution
[03:43:57.080 --> 03:44:03.080]  and progressive policies will get us all under control very interesting look at some of the
[03:44:03.080 --> 03:44:07.240]  other reviews here the people comments they've made standing shows that the condition of work
[03:44:07.240 --> 03:44:13.000]  and politics are subtly and brutally related likewise related to the slowly clarifying crisis
[03:44:13.000 --> 03:44:18.040]  of american democracy one person put in here exactly that's what you're going to see and
[03:44:18.760 --> 03:44:24.360]  if i look at the actual the first chapter here we start to define what the precariat is
[03:44:24.360 --> 03:44:30.360]  he says in his own book here the creation of a global precariat consisting of many millions
[03:44:30.360 --> 03:44:36.760]  around the world without an anchor of stability see this guy i'm sure i haven't read the book
[03:44:36.760 --> 03:44:40.600]  completely yet i've just started reading the first a couple of chapters i picked chapter one
[03:44:40.600 --> 03:44:46.120]  and chapter four here to start going through i can tell you if he's a uk economist and he
[03:44:46.120 --> 03:44:52.360]  wants to break down his analysis of everything into classes of people i can pretty much guess
[03:44:52.360 --> 03:44:59.880]  that he's not a he's not a libertarian economist okay he is some kind of a neo marxist of some
[03:44:59.880 --> 03:45:07.400]  stripe and of course precariat harkens back to the proletariat that marx gave us you know this is
[03:45:07.400 --> 03:45:15.080]  the underclass the people who now they believe are dangerously precarious why because of what
[03:45:15.080 --> 03:45:21.640]  they have done to us you're probably part of the precariat let me let me read you what he says
[03:45:21.640 --> 03:45:27.320]  this anchor events of uh they're taking away the anchor of stability from the world they're
[03:45:27.320 --> 03:45:33.960]  becoming a new dangerous class they're prone to listen to ugly voices and vote for people
[03:45:33.960 --> 03:45:39.000]  who want to change this globalism you know people like donald trump those ugly voices that they
[03:45:39.000 --> 03:45:44.840]  keep telling us are ugly voices and to use their votes and their money to give those ugly voices
[03:45:44.840 --> 03:45:49.560]  a political platform of increasing influence this is what they're reading at bill de berg
[03:45:49.560 --> 03:45:53.720]  how do we control these people how do we control how do we keep them
[03:45:54.440 --> 03:45:58.280]  in this united states of europe that we've created how do we keep britain from leaving
[03:45:58.280 --> 03:46:03.240]  how do we control these people uh they're they're not happy with the euro this thing is a basket
[03:46:03.240 --> 03:46:08.520]  case this currency they're not happy with our open borders that's destroying their country
[03:46:09.160 --> 03:46:12.280]  and they're going to do something about it some of these people are leaving if britain leaves
[03:46:12.280 --> 03:46:18.200]  is going to trigger a lot of these types of exits all over europe they say this is comes from a
[03:46:18.200 --> 03:46:23.160]  neoliberal agenda they admit it that embraced to a greater or lesser extent by governments of
[03:46:23.160 --> 03:46:28.920]  all complexions and has created an incipient political monster this is what this this is his
[03:46:28.920 --> 03:46:35.400]  words action is needed before that monster comes to life guess what they're pretty scared of us
[03:46:35.400 --> 03:46:40.120]  aren't they they're pretty scared so they're talking about the precariat now here's an example
[03:46:40.120 --> 03:46:45.640]  the precariat stir he says in 1989 the city of prado a short distance from florida in italy
[03:46:45.640 --> 03:46:52.680]  was almost entirely italian it had 180 000 residents that year a group of 38 chinese workers arrived
[03:46:52.680 --> 03:46:58.920]  and a new breed of garment firms began to emerge they imported more and more chinese laborers okay
[03:47:00.280 --> 03:47:07.400]  the importation of workers the exportation of jobs this is these are the policies of globalization
[03:47:07.400 --> 03:47:13.240]  that these people at bill de berg have given us now what happened that was the situation 1999
[03:47:13.240 --> 03:47:21.720]  i'm sorry 1989 basically 180 000 residents this italian city and just 38 chinese workers come
[03:47:22.360 --> 03:47:29.880]  by 2008 there were 4200 chinese companies registered in the city 45 000 chinese workers
[03:47:29.880 --> 03:47:37.800]  so they go from 38 chinese workers to 45 000 chinese workers and there are 4200 chinese firms
[03:47:37.800 --> 03:47:43.640]  they're making up one fifth of the city's population they were producing a million garments every day
[03:47:43.640 --> 03:47:48.760]  enough to dress the world's population in 20 years according to calculations by the city officials
[03:47:48.760 --> 03:47:55.160]  meanwhile undercut by the chinese buffeted by competition from indian bangladesh local italian
[03:47:55.160 --> 03:48:03.000]  firms shed workers in droves and by 2010 they only had 20 000 italians working in this town
[03:48:03.000 --> 03:48:09.480]  11 000 fewer than in 2000 in other words a full third of the people have lost their jobs
[03:48:10.200 --> 03:48:16.280]  then came the financial shock which hit prato in much the same way as it did the many of the old
[03:48:16.280 --> 03:48:20.440]  industrial areas of europe and north america bankruptcies multiplied unemployment rose
[03:48:21.000 --> 03:48:26.840]  and resentment turned nasty oh well they shouldn't be afraid they shouldn't be angry about that i mean
[03:48:26.840 --> 03:48:32.680]  you know you got uh the globalists are making a lot of money and you're getting those cheap goods
[03:48:32.680 --> 03:48:38.920]  isn't that great but you have no job see same thing is going to happen in spades with robots
[03:48:39.720 --> 03:48:43.320]  and that's the other issue that's coming it's not even going to be about immigrants
[03:48:43.320 --> 03:48:47.080]  it's going to be about technology displacement but listen to what happened within months the
[03:48:47.080 --> 03:48:53.720]  political left have been swept from power by what this guy guy standing calls the xenophobic
[03:48:53.720 --> 03:48:59.160]  northern league oh they're afraid of foreigners why would they be afraid of foreigners they've
[03:48:59.160 --> 03:49:06.200]  only overrun their city and taken a made a third of the people lose their jobs okay why should we
[03:49:06.200 --> 03:49:12.920]  be concerned about that no problem so what happened was they elected a new government there
[03:49:13.880 --> 03:49:17.800]  and they started deporting these people they launched nighttime raids on the factories
[03:49:17.800 --> 03:49:22.280]  and the sweatshops and we wouldn't want to launch a raid on a sweatshop i mean we wouldn't want to do
[03:49:22.280 --> 03:49:28.280]  that right rounding up workers demonizing them just as the northern league's political ally prime
[03:49:28.280 --> 03:49:34.600]  minister silvio silvio braskoni spoke of his determination to defeat quote the army of evil
[03:49:34.600 --> 03:49:41.080]  as he described illegal immigrants okay bizarrely they say the chinese government seemed reluctant
[03:49:41.080 --> 03:49:45.080]  to take the migrants back no they don't want them back anymore than the mexican government would
[03:49:45.080 --> 03:49:50.280]  take back mexican immigrants they don't want them back they they want them out of the country
[03:49:50.280 --> 03:49:55.240]  they want them in your country and they say the chinese built up a community within a community
[03:49:55.240 --> 03:50:00.760]  this is part of the problem chinese gangs reportedly organized the exodus from china
[03:50:01.320 --> 03:50:07.880]  and they ran the enclave oh you mean kind of like the mules and the gangs and the organized crime
[03:50:07.880 --> 03:50:12.600]  that is running illegal immigration over our border see same thing happened in italy same
[03:50:12.600 --> 03:50:18.760]  thing happened in italy that is happening here they ran the enclave they were vying for control
[03:50:18.760 --> 03:50:25.960]  with gangs from russia from albania from nigeria from romania as well as the italian mafia so organized
[03:50:25.960 --> 03:50:32.680]  crime is running all of the illegal immigrants there and they are trying to set up a monopoly
[03:50:32.680 --> 03:50:40.360]  over these sweatshops creating slave labor in a town that used to be 100 italian and within
[03:50:40.360 --> 03:50:46.840]  about 20 years they have lost a third of their jobs they're overrun with chinese gangs chinese
[03:50:46.840 --> 03:50:52.600]  gangs linking up with chinese companies investing in italian infrastructure projects taking over
[03:50:52.600 --> 03:50:54.680]  the country stay with us we'll be right back

[03:54:21.080 --> 03:54:26.680]  gone fast with a girl named bow welcome back to the alex joe show i'm david night in this last
[03:54:26.680 --> 03:54:33.560]  segment i want to conclude summarize what this precarious is because uh this guy guy standing
[03:54:33.560 --> 03:54:39.240]  who wrote this book four years ago talked about the dangerous emerging class he called it a monster
[03:54:39.240 --> 03:54:44.520]  that is emerging and how these elites have to control it and of course he's talking he says well
[03:54:44.520 --> 03:54:50.760]  we got four different classes he got he says we got tiny super rich elite okay he says their
[03:54:50.760 --> 03:54:55.800]  relationship with the rest of humanity appears to be fleeting at best then there's a salatariat
[03:54:55.800 --> 03:55:01.400]  people on salaries okay who still maintain their career privileges of pensions holidays other
[03:55:01.400 --> 03:55:07.480]  employment benefits in other words the minions of that super rich elite class alongside the
[03:55:07.480 --> 03:55:13.960]  salatariat or the professional technicians or proficient okay then he said we have some highly
[03:55:13.960 --> 03:55:20.360]  paid consultants and so forth and so on then there's the precariat the proletariat that
[03:55:20.360 --> 03:55:26.600]  is dangerously precarious position this volatile political movement and this is something that
[03:55:26.600 --> 03:55:30.680]  we have seen throughout history that example that i just read you in the last section there
[03:55:31.320 --> 03:55:41.240]  about the city of preto from 1989 to 2008 okay uh a uh you know short period 20 30 years there
[03:55:42.200 --> 03:55:49.400]  okay 20 years uh what happened to transform that town there and what we're looking at here
[03:55:49.400 --> 03:55:56.600]  here are political technological economic forces that are changing idli and changing america in
[03:55:56.600 --> 03:56:01.800]  the same way and this small town that he picks as an example is something that is going to be
[03:56:01.800 --> 03:56:08.040]  happening in america we're at the stage right now where people are looking at the results of nafta
[03:56:08.040 --> 03:56:13.480]  looking at what's going on with the tpp the ttip and saying that's enough stop we're not going
[03:56:13.480 --> 03:56:17.480]  to do that we know where this leads we've already seen what happened with nafta we've seen what
[03:56:17.480 --> 03:56:25.080]  happened in idli and so forth we're going to stop this and we can see what happens as well in the
[03:56:25.080 --> 03:56:32.040]  ancillary issues in terms of the organized crime the influence of these different mafia groups that
[03:56:32.040 --> 03:56:37.800]  come in as part of this it reminds me very much of what happened in the 1860s yeah that's the time
[03:56:37.800 --> 03:56:43.160]  of the american civil war of course we're all told in our government schools that it was simply
[03:56:43.160 --> 03:56:50.360]  a war about the liberation of slavery okay it wasn't it wasn't it may surprise you to know
[03:56:50.920 --> 03:56:55.480]  that at the same time we had our civil war there were massive forces that were happening
[03:56:55.480 --> 03:57:02.760]  in europe as well it was a consolidation of regional power centers into a concentrated
[03:57:02.760 --> 03:57:09.800]  consolidated nation state just like the united states idli at that time was broken into a lot
[03:57:09.800 --> 03:57:14.040]  of different power regions that were pretty much separate and autonomous there wasn't a central
[03:57:14.040 --> 03:57:21.320]  state and they had a civil war in the 1860s just as we do and and garibaldi's army look it up
[03:57:21.320 --> 03:57:27.320]  take a look at what's happening in that period of time in idli you've got agrarian interests
[03:57:27.320 --> 03:57:32.760]  who basically had been the power center that landed agrarian interest and taking on the new
[03:57:32.760 --> 03:57:39.480]  industrial class the new industrial class became the predominant class and they established the
[03:57:39.480 --> 03:57:45.880]  centralized concentrated nation state same thing happened in idli that happened here agrarian
[03:57:45.880 --> 03:57:53.080]  versus industrial the industrial side one they created a concentrated consolidated nation state
[03:57:53.080 --> 03:57:58.840]  slavery wasn't even an issue there they used slavery there was a small part of the issue here
[03:57:58.840 --> 03:58:05.160]  they use that here to give them the moral high ground for a conflict that was happening everywhere
[03:58:05.160 --> 03:58:11.400]  we are at the cusp of a similar major turn in history as we've talked about many times the
[03:58:11.400 --> 03:58:16.840]  fourth turning we are at the point now where there is a major move to consolidate from that
[03:58:16.840 --> 03:58:23.160]  powerful nation state to a global government and they're very worried about the precarious
[03:58:23.160 --> 03:58:28.840]  because that's where the balance of power is going to be held if we can wake people up join us tonight
[03:58:28.840 --> 03:58:39.560]  7 central 8 p.m. eastern for the nightly news
