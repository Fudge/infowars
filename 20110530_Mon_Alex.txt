[00:00.000 --> 00:12.560]  The House votes 138 to 0 to kick a bunch of pedophiles out of our state and the Senate
[00:12.560 --> 00:17.360]  gets down on their knees and lets their boots.
[00:17.360 --> 00:25.440]  I want to talk to you about treachery, about treason, about abuse of power, and the authoritarian
[00:25.440 --> 00:30.080]  control grid that is destroying our constitutional republic.
[00:30.080 --> 00:36.480]  On May 24, 2011, the U.S. Attorney sent a threatening letter to the Texas State House
[00:36.480 --> 00:41.840]  informing the Texas Senate that if they passed the bill that had been unanimously passed
[00:41.840 --> 00:49.800]  by the House 138 to 0, blocking TSA from violating state and federal law, groping men, women,
[00:49.800 --> 00:55.720]  children's genitals, including Miss America, who was violated in Dallas, that if they did
[00:55.720 --> 01:00.760]  their duty, their job, and followed common sense in the Constitution and stopped this
[01:00.760 --> 01:06.640]  molestation that was going on, and is still ongoing, that the feds would blockade all
[01:06.640 --> 01:12.120]  the air travel in and out of Texas, the second most populous state in the nation, with mega-cities
[01:12.120 --> 01:15.120]  like Houston, Dallas, San Antonio.
[01:15.120 --> 01:21.760]  They said, if you try to stop our TSA agents from actually sticking their hands in people's
[01:21.760 --> 01:26.520]  pants, not just grabbing their genitals on the outside, and running their hands down
[01:26.520 --> 01:31.120]  into the crease of people's rear end, you can't believe I didn't have to talk about
[01:31.120 --> 01:37.880]  this in America, this extreme power grab, that if they tried to enforce the law in
[01:37.880 --> 01:44.200]  this state, that the feds would create a no fly zone over the state of Texas, a blockade,
[01:44.200 --> 01:45.200]  an act of war.
[01:45.200 --> 01:48.880]  Well, the Texas House said, fine, we don't care, we've passed the bill, we're doing
[01:48.880 --> 01:53.080]  the right thing, don't mess with Texas, let's have this confrontation, let's call
[01:53.080 --> 01:54.080]  your bluff.
[01:54.080 --> 02:02.560]  Now, in the Senate of 31 Senators in the Texas Senate, they had 30 of the 31, a supermajority.
[02:02.560 --> 02:04.600]  Governor Perry claimed he was going to sign it.
[02:04.600 --> 02:14.120]  Well, his crony, David Dewhurst, with a long history in the CIA and coups in Latin America,
[02:14.120 --> 02:22.000]  Klaus Barbie, the Nazi, I mean, you can't make stuff up like this, David Dewhurst, under
[02:22.000 --> 02:29.000]  Justice Department orders, with federal lobbyists violating Texas ethics rules, went on the
[02:29.000 --> 02:37.040]  floor of the House and threatened the members into removing their yes vote, and so the bill
[02:37.040 --> 02:38.040]  was pulled.
[02:38.040 --> 02:45.360]  And we now know about this because of State Senator Dan Patrick of Houston going public.
[02:45.360 --> 02:49.080]  In the San Antonio Express News, the Austin American statesman, the Houston Chronicle,
[02:49.080 --> 02:54.440]  in saying that Dewhurst did not want this information to get out.
[02:54.440 --> 02:59.280]  He didn't want his fingerprints on it, but everybody witnessed it, that he twisted arms
[02:59.280 --> 03:05.840]  and helped expand the threat of a federal blockade or a no fly zone over Texas at the
[03:05.840 --> 03:11.280]  Justice Department, brazenly issued, which is an act of war and international law.
[03:11.280 --> 03:15.760]  What they're doing to Gaddafi right now in Libya, they said no air traffic in or out
[03:15.760 --> 03:21.920]  of Texas, and instead of the Senate going forward and calling the feds bluff, David
[03:21.920 --> 03:26.080]  Dewhurst twisted arms and ensured that the bill died.
[03:26.080 --> 03:30.800]  Well, we got word of this, and there was still time to try to get the bill back on the Senate
[03:30.800 --> 03:37.920]  floor, I called spontaneously in the last hour of my radio show on Wednesday, May 25th
[03:37.920 --> 03:42.640]  for folks to get in their cars, to get down to the Texas Capitol, and to go in there and
[03:42.640 --> 03:51.560]  to confront these federal minions that are trying by stealth to allow the TSA to continue
[03:51.560 --> 03:52.560]  their activities.
[03:52.560 --> 03:57.480]  Dewhurst did not want anyone to know that he was the one that killed this legislation.
[03:57.480 --> 04:01.960]  Not only is he for the groping and the federal domination, but he doesn't want you to know
[04:01.960 --> 04:08.800]  that because he understands how incredibly unpopular these TSA, raped down, groped downs
[04:08.800 --> 04:09.800]  are.
[04:09.800 --> 04:16.240]  This is absolutely outrageous, and everyone needs to remember that as Dewhurst prepares
[04:16.240 --> 04:21.600]  to run for Kay Bailey Hutchinson's Senate seat, that we need a real constitutionalist,
[04:21.600 --> 04:26.320]  a real patriot, and not some corrupt rhino.
[04:26.320 --> 04:31.720]  It shows you how much the establishment Republicans love the police state, and they want to break
[04:31.720 --> 04:36.520]  the will of the American people along with their socialist, communist cohorts in the
[04:36.520 --> 04:38.520]  Obama administration.
[04:38.520 --> 05:03.280]  David Dewhurst used to go ahead and join with Obama, join with the neo-cons, and stop acting
[05:03.280 --> 05:08.280]  like he's a patriot.
[05:08.280 --> 05:12.720]  It's true.
[05:12.720 --> 05:23.500]  Not to be returnsare.
[05:23.500 --> 05:37.380]  That's for sure.

[06:00.820 --> 06:05.100]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with
[06:05.100 --> 06:09.700]  your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function
[06:09.700 --> 06:13.540]  of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions
[06:13.540 --> 06:19.020]  anywhere in or on the body. My name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver
[06:19.020 --> 06:23.700]  Lungs Generator. Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and
[06:23.700 --> 06:29.340]  ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed
[06:29.340 --> 06:35.220]  to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas. This includes the eyes,
[06:35.220 --> 06:41.860]  ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system. Be sure
[06:41.860 --> 06:48.900]  to watch our new seven-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.silverlungs.com
[06:48.900 --> 06:53.620]  to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works. As well, we are always ready

[06:59.780 --> 07:04.420]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[07:04.420 --> 07:08.740]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[07:08.740 --> 07:13.060]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[07:13.060 --> 07:18.140]  allows you to have. It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart
[07:18.140 --> 07:22.780]  grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid
[07:22.780 --> 07:28.420]  is dangerously overloaded. And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[07:28.420 --> 07:32.740]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands
[07:32.740 --> 07:37.420]  of families lose their power from weather-related onages. Number five, a solar power generator
[07:37.420 --> 07:41.620]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar
[07:41.620 --> 07:45.700]  power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can
[07:45.700 --> 07:52.460]  get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com. Remember, the government
[07:52.460 --> 07:59.460]  doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[07:59.460 --> 08:07.460]  He's the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:07.460 --> 08:16.540]  Okay, I want to play a few minutes from the CBS 60 minutes hit piece that aired a few
[08:16.540 --> 08:24.060]  nights ago. And one of the main people they zeroed in on is a radio host, publisher of
[08:24.060 --> 08:30.220]  the Anti-Scheiser News Magazine, ran for Texas Supreme Court, identified by the federal
[08:30.220 --> 08:39.020]  government as one of the top dozen anti-government activists during the 1990s. Dask.wordpress.com
[08:39.020 --> 08:45.540]  is his website. And here's the headline, a look at the sovereign citizen movement. Meanwhile,
[08:45.540 --> 08:50.540]  we have foreign banks openly stealing $27 trillion, and we haven't gotten new numbers
[08:50.540 --> 08:56.380]  in a year. That was two years in. We have the Bill of Rights being trampled. We have
[08:56.380 --> 09:01.860]  the TSA out of their jurisdiction, outside federal and state law, sticking their hands
[09:01.860 --> 09:06.300]  down children's pants, and saying they're going to ignore the state law, passing they
[09:06.300 --> 09:15.500]  can't do it. I read earlier articles are pouring in mainstream TV is admitting in Tennessee
[09:15.500 --> 09:21.380]  another stage that police all over are pulling over even prominent people. That's when
[09:21.380 --> 09:26.220]  they get in trouble is when it's a judge or country music singer, you name it, it's
[09:26.220 --> 09:31.100]  happening to everybody, old ladies, and they're taking as low as 100 bucks out of their wallet.
[09:31.100 --> 09:35.860]  You got proof that $100 is yours? Give it to me. Cops are plugging their cell phones
[09:35.860 --> 09:40.740]  in stealing all their data. All of them. I mean, I mean, look, this happens in history
[09:40.740 --> 09:45.060]  over and over again. It's called tyranny. Here's some of the news items while you were
[09:45.060 --> 09:51.060]  sleeping, they abolished the Fourth Amendment. U.S. Supreme Court claims that if they hear
[09:51.060 --> 09:55.780]  sounds, they don't need a warrant to go in your house. And those against the decision
[09:55.780 --> 10:00.340]  said it's the end of the Fourth Amendment. The Indiana Supreme Court stated for any
[10:00.340 --> 10:06.860]  reason, including no reason at all, no Fourth Amendment. And I read the head judge's quote.
[10:06.860 --> 10:10.700]  He said there is no Fourth Amendment. I mean, they said we can do whatever we want, even
[10:10.700 --> 10:15.900]  without a reason. And he went on and attacked Magna Carta and said it was unreasonable.
[10:15.900 --> 10:20.260]  Again, the government works for us. You got to go to an elected judge to get that warrant.
[10:20.260 --> 10:23.900]  You got to be able to face your accuser. It's all out the window. I mean, now they admit
[10:23.900 --> 10:28.460]  devices are spying on everything. No Fourth Amendment, no Tenth Amendment. They're coming
[10:28.460 --> 10:32.340]  after the second. The ATF has been caught. Now we learned for two years shipping tens
[10:32.340 --> 10:37.180]  of thousands of guns into Mexico to the drug cartels to trace them back here so they could
[10:37.180 --> 10:41.220]  then say we got to restrict and ban semi-autos, which they did. And they don't even care.
[10:41.220 --> 10:45.260]  They got caught. They're still going ahead. I mean, this, it's bigger than Obama, folks.
[10:45.260 --> 10:50.860]  It's total mafia. Okay. He's just their front man. So you learn to hate him. They pull him
[10:50.860 --> 10:55.660]  out, put a new one in. Continuing, while you were sleeping, they abolished the Fourth
[10:55.660 --> 11:03.100]  Amendment. Here's another report, Global of Secret Weapon Kill Chips. Seeing in and
[11:03.100 --> 11:07.540]  now has a report out admitting, yes, industry's putting kill switches, takeover switches and
[11:07.540 --> 11:12.740]  everything. The president is to start breaking in with videos and text bossing you around.
[11:12.740 --> 11:16.140]  They're now announcing the feds are going to break in a local radio and TV, not for
[11:16.140 --> 11:20.620]  emergency alerts, but just with brainwashing. Telescreens going in 9,000 locations saying
[11:20.620 --> 11:26.660]  spy on your neighbors, public schools nationwide with AI software cameras, tracking the kids,
[11:26.660 --> 11:30.380]  recording everything they say, run by the Pentagon. Laptops that got school gives the
[11:30.380 --> 11:34.980]  kids with taxpayer money paid for spying on them at schools. Schools don't care. They're
[11:34.980 --> 11:39.380]  out in the open. We're being bum rushed by the criminal class. I mean, they're just
[11:39.380 --> 11:45.580]  running wild. Their, their theory is a blitzkrieg of corruption. Just hit us. Anybody who speaks
[11:45.580 --> 11:50.300]  out, we got the Homeland Security Mic reports two years ago, gun owners, conservatives,
[11:50.300 --> 11:54.860]  returning veterans, Ron Paul supporters, people that want to end the Fed. Anybody that criticizes
[11:54.860 --> 11:59.820]  the central banks are marked for arrest and they're trying to brainwash the cops. And
[11:59.820 --> 12:05.260]  that's what this show said. If you don't worship the government, you want to kill cops. That's
[12:05.260 --> 12:11.620]  the message. Globalist secret weapon exposed tech kill chips continuing federally mandated
[12:11.620 --> 12:17.940]  live bulbs going to affect next year, $50 each owned by GE, GE shutting down all the
[12:17.940 --> 12:22.300]  other power plants that they basically don't owe. They're given waivers. There's a new
[12:22.300 --> 12:26.660]  list out of the thousands of groups that have been given the presidential waiver. I do not
[12:26.660 --> 12:33.500]  have to get insurance. It's government, clubs, Nancy Pelosi, restaurants, McDonald's, General
[12:33.500 --> 12:38.700]  Electric, just total mafia where you've got to buy the socialist healthcare from the insurance
[12:38.700 --> 12:42.380]  company, but anybody is part of the inside group. Their employees don't have to have
[12:42.380 --> 12:50.900]  it so they can beat you with unfair trade advantage. Just total blind mafia. Neo eco
[12:50.900 --> 12:58.500]  fascist light bulbs cost $50 each. Look at this one. And this is out of Fox business.
[12:58.500 --> 13:03.900]  Philly police harass threatened to shoot man legally carrying gun legal to carry open.
[13:03.900 --> 13:09.300]  The cops beat him up, cuss at him all recorded and said, we don't care what the law is and
[13:09.300 --> 13:13.580]  just throttled him and talked about, we'll blow your head off. A slave doesn't have a
[13:13.580 --> 13:19.060]  gun. We'd play the audio, but there's so many F bombs from the cops. We can't do it. Spokane
[13:19.060 --> 13:23.780]  photographers considered suspicious alkytotypes. We have the newscast where the police say,
[13:23.780 --> 13:28.300]  spy on your neighbors. Anyone photographing evil get them. The government's surveilling
[13:28.300 --> 13:32.740]  us TSA backscatter radiation safety tests were rigged. They wouldn't give Congress the
[13:32.740 --> 13:38.420]  studies for a year. Then they gave them fake studies. That's out. Here's the middle Tennessee
[13:38.420 --> 13:44.300]  police profiting from drug trade robbing cash. Here's the CNN article I mentioned. Why gadget
[13:44.300 --> 13:49.700]  makers wield a kill switch? Well, it's a federal mandate. TSA responds to Texas resistance
[13:49.700 --> 13:55.140]  is futile. We're going to play this clip and then go to Alfred Adask, who would dare chronicle
[13:55.140 --> 13:59.940]  the crime of the crime syndicate who would dare point out the 10th and ninth amendment
[13:59.940 --> 14:05.340]  of the States. That's why they hate him so much. Let's go ahead and play a few minutes
[14:05.340 --> 14:12.220]  and it gets even worse. They say in the newscast, give you criticize the Fed or anybody else.
[14:12.220 --> 14:15.340]  They're a cop killer and the cops say we've got to know who these people are. We got to
[14:15.340 --> 14:19.620]  have a list. Well, that's what these threat fusion centers are all about. They want to
[14:19.620 --> 14:25.060]  know who the real Americans are. Here's the clip. Oh, what is a sovereign citizen? So
[14:25.060 --> 14:30.620]  citizen in its simplest form believes that he is above the law. JJ McNabb has been studying
[14:30.620 --> 14:35.700]  sovereign citizens for a decade. She's testified before Congress and is writing a book about
[14:35.700 --> 14:41.380]  the movement. He has a twisted sense of history and he thinks that people who lived in the
[14:41.380 --> 14:46.820]  18th century were free of all legal constraints and they want to return to that time now.
[14:46.820 --> 14:48.380]  Did never felt reserved.
[14:48.380 --> 14:53.660]  Joe Kane were part of an anti-government movement who went back to the racist Posse-Kamitah
[14:53.660 --> 14:59.540]  standing army in the Montana freemen of the nineties. Convicted Oklahoma City bomber
[14:59.540 --> 15:03.980]  Terry Nichols was a sovereign citizen. That was a federal operation done by actor Wesley
[15:03.980 --> 15:09.940]  Snipes. Convicted of tax evasion in 2008. He used tax loopholes the private banks used.
[15:09.940 --> 15:16.260]  One language. But they're the only ones allowed to pay zero tax. Big bankers. 35. And he is
[15:16.260 --> 15:22.700]  in economic dire straits. Yeah, because of big fat parasites like you. They've probably
[15:22.700 --> 15:29.980]  lost the wife. Paranoid. Many are. Conspiracy theorists. Most are. Do you trust the government?
[15:29.980 --> 15:35.340]  I would argue that it's un-American to trust the government. Alfred Anisk has been a sovereign
[15:35.340 --> 15:40.780]  citizen for 28 years. He's what's called a sovereign guru. One of the movement's leading
[15:40.780 --> 15:46.740]  voices. A roofer by trade. Anisk once published a magazine critical of the legal system.
[15:46.740 --> 15:52.740]  How dare you. Why is a sovereign citizen movement growing? What's driving people to it is they
[15:52.740 --> 15:58.140]  are beginning to understand that the government has moved away from fundamental principles
[15:58.140 --> 16:03.220]  that this nation has built on. Where are the limits in limited government? The sovereignty
[16:03.220 --> 16:08.540]  movement is attempting to rediscover those limits and reassert them. You're eligible
[16:08.540 --> 16:14.020]  for social security. Yes, sir. Do you collect? No. Why not? If you take these benefits you
[16:14.020 --> 16:19.580]  wind up being in the status of a subject rather than a sovereign. You pay taxes? One there
[16:19.580 --> 16:24.540]  do. You know, necessarily it's not true that everyone has to pay taxes. Has the IRS ever
[16:24.540 --> 16:30.120]  come after you for back taxes? Yes. Did you pay? No. You don't like this government very
[16:30.120 --> 16:35.340]  much, do you? I think the government has gone far beyond its constitutional limits. They
[16:35.340 --> 16:39.820]  think, hey, we're not, we're the government. We can do anything. And some people are saying,
[16:39.820 --> 16:44.580]  no, I don't think you can. Atisk. Like others, sovereign gurus. All right, that's Alfred Atisk.
[16:44.580 --> 16:49.260]  And he joins us now for five minutes into the next hour. We have a surprise guest for
[16:49.260 --> 16:55.380]  about 30 minutes or so after that in studio. Alfred, they are moving now from getting rid
[16:55.380 --> 16:59.100]  of the Bill of Rights, the name of fighting their Al-Qaeda brigades, which are now the
[16:59.100 --> 17:05.140]  heroes in Libya were told to the domestic groups. I believe they're really thinking about staging
[17:05.140 --> 17:11.260]  some new domestic events so they can really come after people like you and I. And it shows
[17:11.260 --> 17:16.580]  they're getting scared because you and others are calling them out, Alfred. Well, I agree
[17:16.580 --> 17:20.780]  with you. And I think, you know, they have certainly stepped up their activity in recent
[17:20.780 --> 17:26.300]  times, but that's not necessarily evidence that they're becoming more powerful. It may
[17:26.300 --> 17:31.860]  be evidence that they're becoming more desperate. They realize this thing is coming to a head
[17:31.860 --> 17:35.580]  and they're trying to grab whatever they can before the whole thing explodes in their
[17:35.580 --> 17:40.700]  face. I think they see the direction things are going. And I think they are perhaps desperate
[17:40.700 --> 17:45.420]  to stop people like you and me, thousands, millions of others that are beginning to
[17:45.420 --> 17:50.460]  understand, you know, this can't continue. Now they're not building hardened bunkers
[17:50.460 --> 17:54.580]  in every city. And then we get the internal training manuals. It's not for guys wearing
[17:54.580 --> 17:59.380]  turbans that they know work for them. It's for the American people. They know they're
[17:59.380 --> 18:02.140]  criminals.
[18:02.140 --> 18:08.740]  We are living in difficult, dangerous, and interesting times. And the most important
[18:08.740 --> 18:15.660]  thing is to stand up. You know, the worst thing you can possibly do right now is hunker
[18:15.660 --> 18:21.780]  down and be quiet. It's precisely when they come up and they try to exercise, try to hit
[18:21.780 --> 18:26.820]  us with as much force as possible. They do that to intimidate people into being quiet.
[18:26.820 --> 18:32.100]  They do it to intimidate you into fear. You can't succumb to it. Now is the time when
[18:32.100 --> 18:35.660]  you really have to stand up. And if, and if they're all possible, you need to stand up
[18:35.660 --> 18:37.900]  with other people at the same time.
[18:37.900 --> 18:42.300]  Yeah, they're like, they're like a marlin fish on the line that's desperate and runs
[18:42.300 --> 18:47.820]  out 100 or 200 yards. That fish is getting tired. When he finally runs the hardest, you
[18:47.820 --> 18:51.460]  know he's about to give up. And that's why they're sticking the hands down the baby's
[18:51.460 --> 18:57.260]  pants. That's why they're beating up photographers because they're running on that line desperately.
[18:57.260 --> 19:00.940]  They got blood coming out their mouth. Their heart's beating. Their muscles are burning.
[19:00.940 --> 19:02.100]  They're about to implode.
[19:02.100 --> 19:09.600]  Yeah, I agree. So the point to this is that, you know, if this system was operating smoothly
[19:09.600 --> 19:15.500]  and if they were really running this operation, people wouldn't even be complaining. They
[19:15.500 --> 19:19.380]  wouldn't be suspecting. The sheep would be sheared and they would thank the guy that
[19:19.380 --> 19:24.660]  sheared them and say, well, thanks very much for taking my fleece. It's because the system
[19:24.660 --> 19:31.020]  is on the edge of maybe losing control that it becomes desperate. That means now is the
[19:31.020 --> 19:35.740]  time for people like us, people that are listening to this program, you got to stand up. This
[19:35.740 --> 19:40.740]  is our opportunity. It's not just our danger. It is our opportunity.
[19:40.740 --> 19:44.180]  All right, we're going to come back. Let's talk, let's chronicle some of their greatest
[19:44.180 --> 19:50.660]  crimes, their big frauds, the TSA saying resistance is futile. We can stick our hands down your
[19:50.660 --> 19:56.180]  pants anywhere we want. We are God, where they're going and the type of persecution
[19:56.180 --> 20:01.180]  you've been under. We'll be right back.
[20:01.180 --> 20:06.620]  You've heard a lot lately about zeolite, but what is it and why do you need it? Zeolite
[20:06.620 --> 20:11.780]  is a beautiful complex crystalline structure that encapsulates radiation and odors. Zeol

[20:17.420 --> 20:22.380]  security scanners or nuclear fallout. Zeol King flushes environmental toxins absorbed
[20:22.380 --> 20:27.900]  from smoke, cell phones and chemicals. So it detoxifies heavy metals, including mercury,
[20:27.900 --> 20:32.980]  lead and cadmium. Zeol King zeolite helps boost your immune system, allowing your body
[20:32.980 --> 20:38.340]  to balance itself and cut off food supply to cancer and parasites. Order your Zeol King

[21:34.020 --> 21:38.260]  counterfeit and carding to a private bank having it led back at interest, forcing taxes
[21:38.260 --> 21:42.380]  to serve as debt. This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing
[21:42.380 --> 21:45.820]  the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing
[21:45.820 --> 21:46.820]  army.
[21:46.820 --> 21:50.380]  Hi, Ted Anderson, I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system. Call

[22:00.060 --> 22:05.100]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones. The earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster that killed thousands
[22:05.100 --> 22:10.420]  of Japanese citizens is nothing compared to the devastation that could be caused by hyperinflation
[22:10.420 --> 22:15.460]  that will soon hit the United States and could lead to millions of Americans becoming homeless.
[22:15.460 --> 22:20.460]  All caused by the devalued US dollar while the mainstream media continues to ignore inflation.
[22:20.460 --> 22:25.060]  Our friends at the National Inflation Association provide a free weekly newsletter that educates
[22:25.060 --> 22:29.340]  Americans of the facts and truth about the US economy and inflation. I urge you to sign
[22:29.340 --> 22:36.180]  up at the NIA's free newsletter at www.inflation.us to learn how you can not only survive but prosper
[22:36.180 --> 22:40.740]  during the upcoming hyperinflation crisis. Silver has more than doubled since the NIA
[22:40.740 --> 22:45.940]  declared silver the best investment for the next decade on inflation.us. The NIA's team
[22:45.940 --> 22:50.860]  of expert economists are happy to answer any economic questions you have about inflation,
[22:50.860 --> 22:56.700]  debt, currencies, real estate, precious metals and commodities. Visit inflation.us to learn
[22:56.700 --> 23:00.020]  the economic truth that the mainstream media ignores.
[23:00.020 --> 23:03.700]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about a product the drug companies don't want you
[23:03.700 --> 23:09.260]  to know about. It's called osteo-K. Osteo-K is an osteoporosis supplement shown to decrease
[23:09.260 --> 23:14.580]  fractures 87% without any of the dangerous side effects of medications. Calcium and vitamin
[23:14.580 --> 23:22.020]  D only decrease fractures by 16%. Osteo-K decreases fractures an astounding 87%. Friends, osteoporosis
[23:22.020 --> 23:26.780]  is a deadly disease. Research shows the most effective approach for protecting your bones
[23:26.780 --> 23:32.180]  is not a drug at all. It's osteo-K, manufactured entirely in America. Osteo-K is available
[23:32.180 --> 23:36.620]  without a prescription and comes with an unconditional money-back guarantee. Don't wait until it's
[23:36.620 --> 23:41.420]  too late because if you have osteoporosis and fracture a hip, you have a 20% chance of dying
[23:41.420 --> 23:45.420]  within a year. I urge you to take charge of your health today. I cannot recommend this
[23:45.420 --> 23:57.540]  breakthrough product enough. Go to www.nbihealth.com or call 800-624-1416 right now. That's 800-624-1416.
[23:57.540 --> 24:16.500]  You're taking Osteo-K.
[24:16.500 --> 24:22.460]  Folks, if you studied the Bill and Wright's Constitution, history in any country in history,
[24:22.460 --> 24:26.740]  this would be called tyranny. What we're living under, and I've got to be honest, I admire
[24:26.740 --> 24:33.500]  the illegal aliens. Most of them don't pay any taxes, they don't have any ID, they do
[24:33.500 --> 24:38.020]  whatever they want, and because they do it as a group, they're sovereign. They walk into
[24:38.020 --> 24:44.340]  a bank, no ID, they're giving it. Citizens, though, are kept basically like slaves, and
[24:44.340 --> 24:49.220]  the system wants to keep us down. It's like in that clip from a bug's life with the grasshoppers
[24:49.220 --> 24:55.660]  talking about, if you let one ant stand up, all the ants might stand up. I got to say,
[24:55.660 --> 25:01.420]  the illegal aliens behave a lot more like old-time Americans did than we do, and now
[25:01.420 --> 25:05.220]  the globalists want them there to drive down wages. That's why they let them get away with
[25:05.220 --> 25:10.700]  it. But more and more, Alfred, I think it's because the illegal aliens just won't put
[25:10.700 --> 25:15.980]  up with it. But continue breaking down why they're coming after the sovereign-citizen
[25:15.980 --> 25:19.380]  movement, who this new world order is, and where you think we're going.
[25:19.380 --> 25:25.260]  The whole idea behind sovereignty, the sovereignty movement. I mean, I don't even like that term.
[25:25.260 --> 25:30.220]  For me, it's not a movement. I'm not a member of any group to say, well, what it is, it's
[25:30.220 --> 25:35.420]  an idea whose time has come again. That's what it comes down to, and the whole question
[25:35.420 --> 25:40.620]  about sovereignty is, who's running this country? Are we the people running this country, or
[25:40.620 --> 25:45.020]  is the government running this country? What the sovereign-citizens are essentially saying,
[25:45.020 --> 25:48.860]  we the people, just like it says in the Constitution, we're running this country. And the government
[25:48.860 --> 25:54.140]  says, no, you're not. You're a bunch of subjects. And that's what this is about. Who is in control?
[25:54.140 --> 25:59.420]  The government says, we've got to obey all their laws. But the problem is the law goes
[25:59.420 --> 26:04.940]  in levels. You've got God's law number one. And then you have the law of the people, number
[26:04.940 --> 26:09.620]  two, and that law is enshrined in the constitutions at the state and federal level. That's the
[26:09.620 --> 26:14.060]  people's law. And then we get the law passed by government down at the bottom. The government
[26:14.060 --> 26:17.740]  says, we've got to obey our law. And we're saying, no, you've got to obey our law. You've
[26:17.740 --> 26:22.100]  got to obey our law and the Constitution. And the government says, no, we don't have
[26:22.100 --> 26:26.940]  to obey the Constitution, but you've got to obey our law. That's the guts of the sovereignty
[26:26.940 --> 26:31.300]  problem right now. Whose law is going to be followed? And ultimately, you're going to
[26:31.300 --> 26:32.500]  have God's law at the top.
[26:32.500 --> 26:37.420]  We'll take these clergy response teams that Genesis Talk Show host, Pastor Bush Paul,
[26:37.420 --> 26:41.420]  first discovered. I was then sent hundreds and hundreds of pages, and the preacher got
[26:41.420 --> 26:45.500]  threatened over it. And people didn't believe the documents until two years later when national
[26:45.500 --> 26:49.860]  and local TV covered it and said how great it was. Oh, the tens of thousands of preachers
[26:49.860 --> 26:53.980]  are trained per year secretly to tell their flocks to submit and do whatever government
[26:53.980 --> 26:59.380]  says because Romans 13 out of context, Hitler's favorite verse to control the Germans. Well,
[26:59.380 --> 27:04.340]  in America, we, the people are the government. So render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's.
[27:04.340 --> 27:09.780]  And that's exactly right. Exactly. And that idiot from 60 minutes was going, you know,
[27:09.780 --> 27:13.980]  you don't like the government. Alfred, a desk is the government. Well, you know, oh, well,
[27:13.980 --> 27:18.980]  you don't like to pay your taxes. We didn't have this till 1913. This is alien. Go ahead.
[27:18.980 --> 27:23.860]  Well, I, nobody's crazy about paying taxes, but the government's not crazy about obeying
[27:23.860 --> 27:29.380]  the Constitution. What is worse, handful of people aren't paying taxes or a government
[27:29.380 --> 27:34.100]  that's not obeying the Constitution. Why should we pay taxes to a government that does not
[27:34.100 --> 27:40.060]  obey the Constitution? Or that's run by banks that exempt themselves. That's really waking
[27:40.060 --> 27:45.260]  people up that all these mega banks pay almost zero tax. Yeah. Yeah. It's they want all the
[27:45.260 --> 27:49.540]  little people to pay taxes and the big operators. Why doesn't the federal reserve pay taxes
[27:49.540 --> 27:55.500]  private company? Why don't they pay taxes? Probably make more money than anybody, but
[27:55.500 --> 27:59.140]  you know, it's coming out. I've even seen the Washington Post some years, they do a study
[27:59.140 --> 28:05.340]  upwards of half of Congress doesn't pay taxes and nobody prosecutes them. Yeah. Yeah. If
[28:05.340 --> 28:11.980]  you're in the work and they can get away with it, undoubtedly, not simply because they have
[28:11.980 --> 28:18.740]  power, but because when they do get away with it, now there's leverage to come after them.
[28:18.740 --> 28:23.420]  And now they're on a leash. You don't have to pay taxes, but you better vote the way
[28:23.420 --> 28:29.140]  you have to vote. I will tell you how to vote. You get away with paying without paying taxes.
[28:29.140 --> 28:33.460]  But if you step out of line, we're going to throw your button the slammer. It's the
[28:33.460 --> 28:37.580]  old corruption, how they try to get you into the corruption. Yeah, I understand. Oh, no,
[28:37.580 --> 28:41.380]  I'm just making sure the listeners do Alfred. I've got, I've got to get you on more often.
[28:41.380 --> 28:46.060]  We've got a long segment coming up and a couple more after that, and we've got a surprise
[28:46.060 --> 28:52.140]  guest and studio scheduled. But when we come back from break here in an 18 minutes segment,
[28:52.140 --> 28:56.300]  I want to get into some of the outrageous of these crooks and why you say they're illegitimate.
[28:56.300 --> 29:02.340]  Let's start rolling now. I mean, start. Okay, you want me to start talking now. Okay. I
[29:02.340 --> 29:05.580]  mean, what woke you up just briefly before you got a break? Oh, I went through a divorce
[29:05.580 --> 29:09.820]  in 1983. I was as fat, dumb and happy as anybody else. And I went through a divorce, suffered
[29:09.820 --> 29:13.740]  injustice. One thing led to another. And I became a student of the legal system. And
[29:13.740 --> 29:17.820]  that's what really precipitated this and got this going. I never got never quit, you
[29:17.820 --> 29:22.180]  know, and just keep on and you keep on. Um, I made a comment on the 60 minutes program
[29:22.180 --> 29:26.180]  that it's un-American to trust the government. A lot of people would find that remarkable.
[29:26.180 --> 29:29.180]  No, that's true. Stay there. We're going to come back with that. We're going to come
[29:29.180 --> 29:32.540]  back right there. Stay there. We're going to have the floor when we come back. Definitely
[29:32.540 --> 29:35.900]  have this guy back. I've listed him on the radio off and on for years, always meant to
[29:35.900 --> 29:44.260]  get him on. And we've got him on now. Alfred Dask. It's a dash dot wordpress.com adask.wordpress.com.
[29:44.260 --> 29:47.820]  Our sites, of course, are info wars.com and prison punna.tv. We'll be right back with
[29:47.820 --> 29:55.540]  Alfred. Stay with us. We're on the March, the empires on the run. Alex Jones and the

[32:24.780 --> 32:30.140]  exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.

[32:45.540 --> 32:51.420]  of the New World Order's hellish plan. The police state isn't coming. It's here. Secure

[32:57.940 --> 33:08.620]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[33:08.620 --> 33:15.140]  Cultures go through cycles and we are in a very deep cycle of decadence and corruption
[33:15.140 --> 33:22.700]  mixed with nuclear weapons, bio weapons, high tech surveillance, television brainwashing.
[33:22.700 --> 33:30.540]  We're all living an experiment here. And as we went to break, Alfred Adask was making
[33:30.540 --> 33:36.300]  the point that his maxim is it is American to not trust your government. Well, that is
[33:36.300 --> 33:43.460]  as American as apple pie, but that's alien to some new listeners. That shows how domesticated
[33:43.460 --> 33:50.540]  many of us have become. Alfred, please continue repeating what you said. You have the floor.
[33:50.540 --> 33:55.100]  You look at, I mean, the genius of the American Constitution and there's things to complain
[33:55.100 --> 34:02.260]  about it and maybe some flaws. But as originally drafted, the genius is that it's an anti-government
[34:02.260 --> 34:09.460]  document. The reason we have separation of powers is so the three branches of governments
[34:09.460 --> 34:14.580]  fight amongst each other and don't fight with us. The reason we have the right to keep and
[34:14.580 --> 34:19.780]  bear arms is to protect us against the government. The reason for freedom of speech and freedom
[34:19.780 --> 34:24.380]  of the press is not so we can read gossip about what they're doing on the new housewives
[34:24.380 --> 34:30.140]  of New York or some damn thing. It's about telling people what someone saw in the government.
[34:30.140 --> 34:34.340]  Somebody saw something, the government's doing something wrong. Talk about it. It's intended
[34:34.340 --> 34:39.460]  for every bit of that. The reason we have elections every two years. If we really trusted
[34:39.460 --> 34:42.540]  the government, why don't we just elect these guys at one time and they stay there until
[34:42.540 --> 34:48.500]  they die? It's because we give them two years at the max, at least at Congress and you better
[34:48.500 --> 34:54.580]  watch your step or we'll throw you out. Every bit of that Congress, every bit of the Constitution
[34:54.580 --> 34:59.820]  was designed to protect us from government. They recognized it's a necessary evil, but
[34:59.820 --> 35:05.380]  they did not trust the government. Let me read a section here from the, there's a preamble
[35:05.380 --> 35:12.060]  to the Bill of Rights. It explains the purpose of the Bill of Rights. You can look this up
[35:12.060 --> 35:15.700]  on the Internet. It's not usually published, but you can find it. You can go to the Internet
[35:15.700 --> 35:21.220]  and just enter preamble to the Bill of Rights and you'll get this. It's only, I don't know,
[35:21.220 --> 35:25.420]  50, 100 words or something like that. It says resolved by the Senate. It says the conventions
[35:25.420 --> 35:29.500]  of a number of states having at the time they're adopting a Constitution expressed a desire
[35:29.500 --> 35:36.900]  in order to prevent misconstruction abuse of its powers, meaning the powers of the Constitution,
[35:36.900 --> 35:42.220]  that further restrictive declaratory and restrictive clauses should be added. Those declaratory
[35:42.220 --> 35:47.780]  and restrictive clauses are the first ten amendments. Their purpose is to prevent abuse
[35:47.780 --> 35:55.460]  of the Constitution. Who could abuse the Constitution except federal officers, officials, and employees?
[35:55.460 --> 35:59.540]  The only people who can abuse the powers of the Constitution are the people who have them
[35:59.540 --> 36:04.860]  to exercise. And that tells us that the purpose of the first ten amendments was to protect
[36:04.860 --> 36:08.860]  the people of the states against the federal government. They didn't trust the government
[36:08.860 --> 36:13.660]  as far as they could throw it. They said we got to have one, but we don't trust the SOBs.
[36:13.660 --> 36:18.940]  And what's the reason for the second amendment? To protect us against the federal government.
[36:18.940 --> 36:28.060]  It says so by implication right there in the preamble to the bill of rights. And it's
[36:28.060 --> 36:32.220]  what I would try to talk about on that 60 minutes interview. And they brought me in
[36:32.220 --> 36:37.740]  because I said, oh, the purpose of the second amendment is to shoot people in the government.
[36:37.740 --> 36:43.260]  And I said, yeah, and here's why. But it's not intended to be a license just to start
[36:43.260 --> 36:52.220]  shooting cops and judges and whatever. It is the means of protecting yourself from despotism.
[36:52.220 --> 36:57.060]  If and when the government becomes despotic and tyrannical, it's like it says in the Declaration
[36:57.060 --> 37:01.660]  of Independence, it's your right, it's your duty to throw off that government. The second
[37:01.660 --> 37:06.900]  amendment is the means to throw off that government. If the government becomes despotic, the second
[37:06.900 --> 37:10.500]  amendment kicks in. It doesn't mean you go shoot every cop you can find. That's never
[37:10.500 --> 37:14.660]  been my point. But the point is if they are despotic, second amendment.
[37:14.660 --> 37:20.740]  And like it or not, I was sent the internal FEMA footage from Kansas City in 2000 where
[37:20.740 --> 37:25.580]  FEMA gets up in front of cops and firemen and teaches them the founding fathers were
[37:25.580 --> 37:30.740]  terrorists, the Bill of Rights Declaration of Independence is is a evil document. They
[37:30.740 --> 37:38.460]  are openly saying in some of these federal documents we've gotten that those that make
[37:38.460 --> 37:44.380]  frequent references to the U.S. Constitution. Well, the cops have sworn an oath to that.
[37:44.380 --> 37:47.980]  And now we have the Indiana Supreme Court. I don't know if you saw that ruling, but
[37:47.980 --> 37:53.100]  the lead judge said cops can come in for any reason or no reason at all. There is no fourth
[37:53.100 --> 38:00.780]  amendment. This is open despotism. This is open evil. And the police more and more are
[38:00.780 --> 38:04.660]  caught just pulling people over, stealing cash out of their wallets. You heard me run
[38:04.660 --> 38:10.700]  through that raft earlier. And now on the TSA website, blogger Bob, the official voice
[38:10.700 --> 38:19.140]  of them, says that Texas, it doesn't matter what you say, we have article six clause two,
[38:19.140 --> 38:24.540]  prevent states from regulating the federal government. I mean, that is on its head claiming
[38:24.540 --> 38:30.300]  that the commerce clause, the supremacy clause gives them all this power only in the issuance
[38:30.300 --> 38:36.540]  of currency only in the Navy and only in protecting the borders. I mean, why even have states
[38:36.540 --> 38:43.860]  if they're so busy? I mean, look at till 1913, the states legislatures voted and picked
[38:43.860 --> 38:48.620]  the U.S. senators. That shows the power of the states. They ran the Senate. They ran
[38:48.620 --> 38:54.060]  the veto. And now they're telling us states have no power. We will stick our hands down
[38:54.060 --> 38:59.540]  your pants and we don't care if the state of Texas unanimously votes unanimously in one
[38:59.540 --> 39:03.220]  of the houses to say, don't stick your hands down people's pants. Well, that's already
[39:03.220 --> 39:09.180]  illegal. And then the feds laugh and giggle on a blog about it.
[39:09.180 --> 39:14.340]  Well, there's a reason to believe that what passes for state government right now may
[39:14.340 --> 39:21.940]  not be state government. 1933 or a government. Yeah, it may be a territorial government
[39:21.940 --> 39:26.020]  and under article four, section three clause two, the federal constitution that Congress
[39:26.020 --> 39:31.220]  has exclusive legislative jurisdiction over the territories. I strongly suspect I can't
[39:31.220 --> 39:36.180]  prove it, but I strongly suspect that what passes for Texas today in the they presume
[39:36.180 --> 39:39.860]  it to be a territory rather than the state of the union. Part of the reason for that
[39:39.860 --> 39:46.580]  article one section 10 clause one says in part, no state shall make anything but gold
[39:46.580 --> 39:52.900]  and silver coin a tender in payment of debts. Now, how does the government of the state
[39:52.900 --> 39:57.980]  of Texas function without gold and silver? The Constitution has never been amended to
[39:57.980 --> 40:01.400]  eliminate that clause, and it doesn't apply to territories and it doesn't apply to
[40:01.400 --> 40:07.940]  the territorial script. Yeah, that's right. And they have by taking the gold and silver
[40:07.940 --> 40:12.580]  out of circulation. I think what they've done is they've rendered the du jour government
[40:12.580 --> 40:17.380]  of the state of the union. I think they've rendered them insolvent and unfunctional.
[40:17.380 --> 40:20.900]  No, what you said is true. They were some sort of a territorial setup.
[40:20.900 --> 40:27.340]  So they created the state police in 33 under federal auspices. They went and financed it
[40:27.340 --> 40:30.860]  basically as part of the federal receivership and they took territorial law that had already
[40:30.860 --> 40:36.700]  been perfected out West and exported it as the federal model. It's not just your theory.
[40:36.700 --> 40:41.180]  I've read in the federal rulings where they talk about force, measure, force to your admiralty
[40:41.180 --> 40:46.140]  law. This is how they're operating. It's how the cops seize cash out of your wallet when
[40:46.140 --> 40:54.780]  no drugs or no arrest is made. They're operating under the federal mandates as state police
[40:54.780 --> 41:00.260]  as part of their agreements with the feds to get 80% receivership back of the money
[41:00.260 --> 41:05.020]  if they go to the feds and not the state. They're operating under admiralty.
[41:05.020 --> 41:12.780]  Yeah, the world is... Well, let me give you, here's a clause dear to my heart. I was sued
[41:12.780 --> 41:18.500]  by the attorney general of the state of Texas for $25,000 a day. That's $9 million a year
[41:18.500 --> 41:24.100]  for the manufacturing distribution of a controlled substance. It's not cocaine or methamphetamine
[41:24.100 --> 41:29.900]  or any of that. I was fiduciary for a trust that leased some equipment, just tables and
[41:29.900 --> 41:36.780]  chairs to a corporation that was manufacturing colloidal silver. They brought me in as the
[41:36.780 --> 41:43.020]  last of seven defendants. The case started in 2001 last to 2007. I was the last one added.
[41:43.020 --> 41:48.620]  First three defendants hired attorneys. They paid them $160,000 for defense. All they did
[41:48.620 --> 41:52.500]  is drive them into bankruptcy. The first three defendants went into bankruptcy. Two of them,
[41:52.500 --> 41:57.100]  husband and wife, divorced, split. They're gone. I got involved in this and read the
[41:57.100 --> 42:01.660]  relevant drug laws because that's what we're charged under. Under the Texas Health and
[42:01.660 --> 42:09.700]  Safety Code, section 431.002, subparagraph 14, it says, drug means articles recognized
[42:09.700 --> 42:15.140]  in the official United States Pharmacopia, yada, yada, yada. Articles intended or designed
[42:15.140 --> 42:19.860]  for use in the diagnosis, cure mitigation treatment or prevention of disease in man
[42:19.860 --> 42:26.220]  or other animals. And the first time I saw a man or other animals, I thought, why the
[42:26.220 --> 42:30.280]  damn fools, I don't even know what they're writing. The phrase means they presume man
[42:30.280 --> 42:35.940]  to be an animal. No, no, that's an inside joke by them. But let me expand on that.
[42:35.940 --> 42:40.100]  They put last year in the Food Safety Act written by Big Pharma. They gave $17 million
[42:40.100 --> 42:45.500]  in just a one week period written by Big Pharma and Big Agra Business to shut down local farms
[42:45.500 --> 42:53.740]  and ranches. Codex Alimentarius, that that entire European Union, EU Act, would be implemented.
[42:53.740 --> 42:57.900]  And luckily it's been defeated so far. But Europe is now implemented. You can pull up
[42:57.900 --> 43:03.420]  the headlines, hundreds of herbal remedies, vitamins banned from over the counter sale.
[43:03.420 --> 43:09.500]  And so, yes, they are saying that under this, they've had SWAT teens raid aloe vera farms
[43:09.500 --> 43:10.500]  because they're sick.
[43:10.500 --> 43:11.500]  That's exactly right.
[43:11.500 --> 43:14.380]  I mean, these people are mafia. It's very simple.
[43:14.380 --> 43:19.140]  We found it in 23 separate laws at the state and federal level that applied directly to
[43:19.140 --> 43:24.620]  our case. I realized the significance you can't declare me to be an animal because my Bible
[43:24.620 --> 43:31.460]  says that Genesis 1, 26 through 28, on the sixth day God created man in his image and
[43:31.460 --> 43:37.620]  gave man dominion over the animals. As a Christian or Jew and probably even as a Muslim, the
[43:37.620 --> 43:42.260]  government can't declare us to be animals without violating our freedom of religion.
[43:42.260 --> 43:46.860]  I made a religious freedom defense. I created a religious freedom defense to this case that
[43:46.860 --> 43:53.620]  the attorney general had spent almost half a million dollars on in six years. And I drafted
[43:53.620 --> 43:56.900]  a religious freedom defense to this and I said, you can't call me an animal. Your law
[43:56.900 --> 43:59.700]  doesn't apply to me. And they dropped the case.
[43:59.700 --> 44:06.180]  Let me stop you. Feds win 98% of the time now because they have special kept juries.
[44:06.180 --> 44:09.900]  How did Alfred Adask defeat these demons?
[44:09.900 --> 44:16.180]  Well, we advanced because here's the point. This law, this definition that defines man
[44:16.180 --> 44:21.100]  to be an animal. And the drug law, it's also found in the medical, the definition of medical
[44:21.100 --> 44:26.780]  devices. It means just thinking about drugs. The war on drugs is based on the presumption
[44:26.780 --> 44:32.420]  that the people are animals. The war on drugs gave rise started by Nixon in 1971. It gave
[44:32.420 --> 44:35.060]  rise to most of the modern police state.
[44:35.060 --> 44:38.660]  And what are they saying? The Godfather, which is a globalist love, because everything's
[44:38.660 --> 44:42.340]  a message. The mafia is sitting around and they go, we're going to start bringing narcotics
[44:42.340 --> 44:47.140]  in. Don Carlioni hadn't let us do this. And Don Carlione says, I'll lose all my judges
[44:47.140 --> 44:51.820]  and police. They'll deal with hookers and alcohol because they like that, but they don't
[44:51.820 --> 44:56.860]  like heroin and cocaine. And the mob boss says, only have it in the colored areas.
[44:56.860 --> 45:00.540]  They're animals. Let them lose their souls. And when you get into globalist doctrine,
[45:00.540 --> 45:05.500]  they believe we're all animals in God. It's social Darwinism. We deserve this. So they're
[45:05.500 --> 45:10.460]  saying, and you mentioned this is in federal states. I've seen it as well. Read it again.
[45:10.460 --> 45:16.220]  We are animals. They're saying man or other animals. We found 23 separate instances that
[45:16.220 --> 45:21.380]  applied to our case laws at both the Texas level and federal level. We found it in five
[45:21.380 --> 45:25.540]  other states where we looked. I presume it to be true in all 50 states or at least the
[45:25.540 --> 45:30.900]  vast majority of them. Last night, I got an email from someone in Australia who's been
[45:30.900 --> 45:34.860]  visiting the website and he's seen the articles I have on man or other animals. And he's looked
[45:34.860 --> 45:40.140]  at the Australian law. The Australian drug law also defines the people to be animals,
[45:40.140 --> 45:45.700]  which tells me that this business of presuming the people to be animals is not confined to
[45:45.700 --> 45:50.700]  the United States. No, it's not. It's illegal fiction that they've created that they then
[45:50.700 --> 45:56.300]  run everything through. Then we threw contract fraud. Explain that to people. We sign on.
[45:56.300 --> 46:01.740]  We now agree as indentured servants. A lot of my family came here as slaves, white slaves.
[46:01.740 --> 46:06.840]  They were indentured servants, seven year, 14 year deals, wherever they signed on to.
[46:06.840 --> 46:12.580]  You come here and then they make you buy everything through the contract from the company store.
[46:12.580 --> 46:16.300]  They have a strong man that keeps you under their control. You never basically get off
[46:16.300 --> 46:21.100]  the plantation. In fact, many historians broke down that white slaves or indentured servants
[46:21.100 --> 46:26.580]  were worse off than blacks because the small 2% that owned slaves that were black wanted
[46:26.580 --> 46:32.140]  to take care of their property. But white slaves were even worse than that.
[46:32.140 --> 46:37.540]  I understand this issue is powerful because, for example, our Declaration of Independence
[46:37.540 --> 46:41.620]  principles this country's built on. Second sentence, we hold these truths to be self-evident
[46:41.620 --> 46:46.500]  that all men are created equal and endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable
[46:46.500 --> 46:50.820]  rights. Among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Those rights only
[46:50.820 --> 46:57.660]  attached to men and women made in God's image. They don't attach to animals. Third sentence
[46:57.660 --> 47:03.540]  of the Declaration says that to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men,
[47:03.540 --> 47:07.180]  deriving their just powers from the consent of government. When they say that to secure
[47:07.180 --> 47:11.180]  these rights, governments are instituted among men. They're telling us that in the vision
[47:11.180 --> 47:16.340]  of the founding fathers, the principal reason for government was to secure to every man,
[47:16.340 --> 47:22.180]  woman, and even unborn child those God-given, unalienable rights which attach at the moment
[47:22.180 --> 47:26.700]  of your creation, not your birth. Under the Declaration of Independence principles, if
[47:26.700 --> 47:31.260]  you recognize to be a man, a woman, or even an unborn child made in God's image, they
[47:31.260 --> 47:37.060]  can't abort you. You become the master. If you are endowed by God, that's the foundation
[47:37.060 --> 47:38.060]  for sovereignty.
[47:38.060 --> 47:43.540]  That's why they changed the definition to fetus. That's why Frank Herbert's book,
[47:43.540 --> 47:47.860]  This Globalist Philosophy, is that the secret cult group then puts you through a ritual
[47:47.860 --> 47:52.060]  to decide if you're a human. They see everyone else as animals. That's what Albert Pike
[47:52.060 --> 47:56.780]  wrote, that most people are animals, steak on the table to be eaten. This is really
[47:56.780 --> 47:58.260]  Illuminati philosophy.
[47:58.260 --> 48:02.980]  Absolutely. And this is important, powerful stuff. Again, if this goes out and people
[48:02.980 --> 48:07.700]  understand it, the reason they dropped this is its political dynamite. The police state
[48:07.700 --> 48:12.540]  is built in large measure on the drug laws. The drug laws are built on the presumption
[48:12.540 --> 48:17.260]  that the people are animals. They can't stand in front of a jury and tell them, we think
[48:17.260 --> 48:20.940]  you're all a bunch of animals. They can't tell them that. If you can draft a religious
[48:20.940 --> 48:26.420]  freedom defense against these people, they have to back off. Because if this goes public
[48:26.420 --> 48:29.500]  and you get a case like this that goes all the way to the Supreme Court and they have
[48:29.500 --> 48:33.380]  to admit that the people aren't animals, well they lose the war on drugs. They lose
[48:33.380 --> 48:40.060]  much of the police state. They lose the prison industrial complex. And of course, big pharmaceuticals
[48:40.060 --> 48:41.060]  are built on this.
[48:41.060 --> 48:47.180]  By the way, Albert, what you've said, story, earlier on erupted, go back to the fact that
[48:47.180 --> 48:50.300]  us not being animals and made in the image of a creator, people don't believe in that
[48:50.300 --> 48:54.580]  or not. The point is that's the law system, that's the precedent, is that we are made
[48:54.580 --> 49:00.140]  in the image of God. We are the sovereigns on this planet and so the elite can't be
[49:00.140 --> 49:04.980]  above us. We have an animal, basic, organic, galactic rights.
[49:04.980 --> 49:09.940]  Well, that's exactly right. See, what people don't understand about sovereignty, the reason
[49:09.940 --> 49:15.380]  the king of France was sovereign was because he alone had the divine right of kings. He
[49:15.380 --> 49:20.860]  became king in a church ceremony. He got his rights directly from God.
[49:20.860 --> 49:26.060]  All the rest were subjects because they did not get their rights directly from God. In
[49:26.060 --> 49:31.660]  our country, when it started out, it started with an incredible, profound concept. They
[49:31.660 --> 49:36.500]  said, no, we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men, not just the kings, the individual
[49:36.500 --> 49:41.580]  kings of England and France and Spain and so on, all men are created equal and endowed
[49:41.580 --> 49:45.980]  by their creator with certain unleanable rights. With that statement, they made each of us
[49:45.980 --> 49:50.700]  an individual sovereign. It's borne out in Chisholm versus Georgia, 1793 Supreme Court
[49:50.700 --> 49:56.340]  of the United States declared this is to be a nation of sovereigns without subjects.
[49:56.340 --> 49:57.700]  Well, this is the fight.
[49:57.700 --> 50:02.900]  God, that makes the government our servant. If you and I are sovereigns, the government
[50:02.900 --> 50:06.660]  is our public servant. If you and our animals, the government is our master.
[50:06.660 --> 50:12.940]  And notice they don't use terms like public servant or peace officer. It's law enforcement.
[50:12.940 --> 50:20.220]  It's official. It's authority. This is just nothing but modern slavery where they are
[50:20.220 --> 50:24.180]  above the law. They don't pay taxes. They do whatever they want and don't follow our
[50:24.180 --> 50:30.140]  original just laws. And then they make unjust laws for us. This is the essence of tyranny.
[50:30.140 --> 50:34.380]  They say we have to obey their law, but they don't have to obey our law. And again, the
[50:34.380 --> 50:38.660]  hierarchy is God's law. Number one, we, the people, our law, number two, and that's the
[50:38.660 --> 50:43.820]  constitutions of the states and the federal government. And finally, we have the government's
[50:43.820 --> 50:47.260]  law. That's number three. They say we're always subject to that, but they don't want to be
[50:47.260 --> 50:52.860]  subject to people's law. This is a, you know, this, this is cause for a shooting revolution
[50:52.860 --> 50:56.700]  if they're not careful. If this goes badly, we're going to have an American spring rather
[50:56.700 --> 50:57.900]  than an Arab spring.
[50:57.900 --> 51:03.340]  Alfred and ask, let's talk about that when we come back. Power.
[51:03.340 --> 51:08.100]  Alex Jones here with key information. The US government is a Ponzi scheme that relies
[51:08.100 --> 51:12.500]  on the treasury, continuously selling large amounts of government bonds to foreign central
[51:12.500 --> 51:18.740]  banks with Japan about to become a seller of US bonds in order to rebuild its own nation
[51:18.740 --> 51:23.780]  and the US antagonizing China by calling them currency manipulators. The Federal Reserve,
[51:23.780 --> 51:29.700]  which is already buying about 70% of US treasuries will soon be the only buyer left of US treasuries.
[51:29.700 --> 51:34.100]  Our friends at the National Inflation Association believe that the US dollar will soon become
[51:34.100 --> 51:39.020]  worthless and Americans will see the purchasing power of their incomes and savings destroyed.
[51:39.020 --> 51:47.580]  I strongly urge my fellow Americans to sign up for the free NIA newsletter at www.inflation.us.

[54:21.860 --> 54:26.180]  The point is, is that he's been around for a long time fighting tyranny. We got him
[54:26.180 --> 54:30.220]  for five minutes in the next hour. Then our surprised guest is going to be here any moment
[54:30.220 --> 54:34.820]  now with some very good news for everybody. So stay with us for that into the fourth hour
[54:34.820 --> 54:40.220]  of Overdrive. If your local AMR FM doesn't carry it, infowars.com. First, I want to tell
[54:40.220 --> 54:44.660]  you about the National Inflation Association. For two-thirds of Americans getting ready
[54:44.660 --> 54:50.700]  to retire, Social Security will be more than 50% of their income. And for 22% of upcoming
[54:50.700 --> 54:56.100]  retirees, Social Security will be their only income. With massive inflation wipes out the
[54:56.100 --> 55:00.060]  purchasing power of American Social Security payments, retirement in America will become
[55:00.060 --> 55:06.100]  a thing of the past. And we will see millions of retired senior citizens re-enter the workforce,
[55:06.100 --> 55:09.500]  combined with millions of government workers who will soon need to find new jobs when the
[55:09.500 --> 55:13.700]  dollar becomes worthless and the government goes bust. It will be nearly impossible for
[55:13.700 --> 55:18.700]  upcoming college graduates to find a job in the U.S. Go to inflation.us and click on
[55:18.700 --> 55:23.540]  the videos tab to see the breakthrough documentary film, The College Conspiracy. Again, that's
[55:23.540 --> 55:32.540]  inflation.us to watch the film today. Now continuing with Alfred Adesque. Alfred, we are at a
[55:32.540 --> 55:38.860]  crossroads. The quickening is here. The system is trying to break our will. And we've seen
[55:38.860 --> 55:44.380]  police chiefs in New Jersey and Maryland say in public statements, get out there, break
[55:44.380 --> 55:49.100]  our will, wear black masks, scare them, you know, Fox News headline, police chief admits
[55:49.100 --> 55:53.460]  they want to scare us. The TSA, first take your shoes off, answer questions. Now we're
[55:53.460 --> 55:57.780]  going to squeeze your genitals on the outside. Now we're going to go inside. We're not going
[55:57.780 --> 56:02.460]  to change our gloves. I mean, they know that if they can get away with that, they're desperately
[56:02.460 --> 56:06.500]  trying to break our will and train us to basically be prisoners.
[56:06.500 --> 56:12.180]  I agree. I agree. They're trying to, and that's exactly the point then is you can't allow
[56:12.180 --> 56:17.540]  that to happen. The most important thing is you can't succumb to fear. They're trying
[56:17.540 --> 56:22.660]  to scare us, but here's the truth. The police are outnumbered about 300 to one in this country.
[56:22.660 --> 56:27.460]  It's only about three-tenths of a pop percent of the population that are police officers.
[56:27.460 --> 56:31.340]  Same thing with the military, about three-tenths of a percent of the population thereabouts.
[56:31.340 --> 56:35.620]  I mean, even if they brought all the military back and they combined them with all the police,
[56:35.620 --> 56:40.900]  they're still technically outnumbered by at least 100 to one on the basis of adults.
[56:40.900 --> 56:46.580]  And what's happening is they're running around, trying to get everybody to be spies for them.
[56:46.580 --> 56:50.460]  Spies, we're not hiding. We know who the crooks are and the average cops that I've talked
[56:50.460 --> 56:53.500]  to are waking up. The military's waking up.
[56:53.500 --> 56:59.580]  You know, and on one level, this is not an us against them, meaning us against the police.
[56:59.580 --> 57:03.940]  The police are standing on the breach on this thing, and they need to make up their mind.
[57:03.940 --> 57:08.020]  Who do they serve and protect? They've got that motto, we serve and protect, but do
[57:08.020 --> 57:11.860]  they serve and protect the government, or do they serve and protect the people of the
[57:11.860 --> 57:16.860]  United States? They'd better understand that the government regards them as nothing but
[57:16.860 --> 57:20.380]  disposable cattle that is born and fodder.
[57:20.380 --> 57:24.300]  Kissinger wrote a book and called our troops dumb animals.
[57:24.300 --> 57:27.980]  That's exactly right. That's exactly right. And they will dispose of them fighting with
[57:27.980 --> 57:33.460]  us. The police really have a lot more in common with the people than they do with their employer.
[57:33.460 --> 57:37.620]  And certainly, they can't afford to go to war with the people. You can't pick a war
[57:37.620 --> 57:41.660]  where you're outnumbered to 101. You can't do that. You're not going to win this. And
[57:41.660 --> 57:43.740]  I don't care what kind of weapons you got, you can't do it.
[57:43.740 --> 57:48.260]  101, bring your best weapon, we'll bring our bricks. You understand? Here comes 100 bricks
[57:48.260 --> 57:49.260]  coming at you.
[57:49.260 --> 57:54.260]  Well, I've seen that with Vietnam, Afghanistan, anywhere. And the biggest contributors of
[57:54.260 --> 58:00.700]  the military in 2008 were the military to Ron Paul. And so I, but at the same time,
[58:00.700 --> 58:03.900]  the system does need to know they're in the wrong. We need to quit licking their boats
[58:03.900 --> 58:07.540]  and being afraid to call them out because the police everywhere are violating the Bill
[58:07.540 --> 58:10.780]  of Rights and Constitution. They are enforcing stuff that isn't law.
[58:10.780 --> 58:15.180]  I agree. And it's part of the reason why the object is not simply to go out and get yourself
[58:15.180 --> 58:21.220]  a firearm or a dozen firearms and a bunch of bullets. You have to understand the reasons
[58:21.220 --> 58:26.020]  for a rational application of force. You've got to pick up and understand the fundamentals
[58:26.020 --> 58:29.860]  out of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence say, wait a second, these
[58:29.860 --> 58:33.860]  are principles. We're not talking about just picking up a gun and shooting out the window
[58:33.860 --> 58:34.860]  or something.
[58:34.860 --> 58:35.860]  Stay there. Stay there.
[58:35.860 --> 58:36.860]  We must have a reason.
[58:36.860 --> 58:40.860]  That's what Indiana just said. We can do whatever we want to you. You can't resist.
[58:40.860 --> 58:48.860]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.

[01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:23.220]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:32.460]  Well, for the next hour, former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura, best-selling author
[01:00:32.460 --> 01:00:36.500]  is our guest, the new book, New York Times' best-selling author, Jesse Ventura with Dick
[01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:41.780]  Russell, 63 documents the government doesn't want you to read, available at infowars.com.
[01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:45.780]  We've got a deal where you get one of the films free when you get the book with Big
[01:00:45.780 --> 01:00:50.700]  Brother. The Orwellian nightmare come true. Now, Governor, it's great to have you back.
[01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:55.620]  You're down in Mexico right now, but we've got you for the full hour. Some stations don't
[01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:59.460]  carry this first five minutes, so I want to cover some sub-issues before we come back
[01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:05.820]  and get your take on the entire Bin Laden fable. And they're telling us that we've got to give
[01:01:05.820 --> 01:01:11.260]  up even more rights now that Bin Laden's been reportedly killed. They're announcing the
[01:01:11.260 --> 01:01:15.500]  government's going to have alerts over our cell phones. They're going to have a no-travel
[01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:20.460]  list now for trains, you name it. We're going to talk about all that with former Minnesota
[01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:27.860]  Governor Jesse Ventura, but getting into the no-travel thing first. So we thought we'd
[01:01:27.860 --> 01:01:33.700]  just skate the TSA by not flying on commercial jets, but now they're announcing, Governor,
[01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:37.820]  that they want to have these on the roads, the highways, the trains. They've been beta
[01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:39.540]  testing those. What's your view on that?
[01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:44.860]  Well, it doesn't surprise me at all because, Alex, you know, I drive to and from Mexico
[01:01:44.860 --> 01:01:52.620]  every year. And after clearing customs at the border, and it doesn't matter what border,
[01:01:52.620 --> 01:01:59.060]  whether it's California or Arizona, when you clear customs, you get about an hour under
[01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:04.020]  the freeway in the United States of America. And this has been going on for the last six
[01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:11.220]  years because that's how long I've been living in Mexico and Minnesota. You come to an immigration
[01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:16.060]  stop out in the middle of a highway where you have to sit out there in the hot desert
[01:02:16.060 --> 01:02:22.940]  for an hour and a half and clear a second immigration stop. So it doesn't surprise me
[01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:28.260]  because these stops have been going along and very illegal, in my opinion, because you've
[01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:33.820]  already shown your passport at the border. Why are you required to produce it again an
[01:02:33.820 --> 01:02:39.340]  hour into the United States? So, you know, this is stuff that they've been setting up
[01:02:39.340 --> 01:02:44.820]  that I've been watching for six years now in my travels via Mexico back to the U.S.
[01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:51.540]  every year. They're just expanding the control. Well, let's say they want to protect us from
[01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:55.300]  terrorists. Terrorists, they get a leak, might want to attack a mall. They're going to put
[01:02:55.300 --> 01:02:59.700]  TSA in front of every mall. Well, they're now announcing they want that. Are they going
[01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:05.580]  to, there's close to 200,000 miles of rails, over two and a half million miles of roads?
[01:03:05.580 --> 01:03:08.900]  I mean, it's impossible to protect all this. It's a joke.
[01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:15.020]  Alex, are they expecting, I mean, the attack? Is that what they're saying? I mean, I've
[01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:18.820]  been down in Mexico. Are they priming us that we're going to get hit again? And so they
[01:03:18.820 --> 01:03:21.340]  want to be preemptive, and that's what they're telling us?
[01:03:21.340 --> 01:03:26.740]  Yes, they've just so happened been training for years with real checkpoints at bus stations
[01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:32.260]  and train terminals. But now they're rolling an out saying, Al Qaeda, it's inevitable they're
[01:03:32.260 --> 01:03:35.980]  going to hit in a revenge for bin Laden. We're talking about after the break. And so you
[01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:40.620]  got to give all your rides up now. And we've got to basically have TSA train, federalized
[01:03:40.620 --> 01:03:45.140]  police through the threat fusion centers, just sticking their hands down our pants everywhere.
[01:03:45.140 --> 01:03:49.700]  Well, you know, it's, it's, it's like the old forefather. I can't remember if it was
[01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:54.740]  Ben Franklin or which one of them said it when they made the great statement that if
[01:03:54.740 --> 01:04:01.460]  you're going to trade your liberty for security, well, then you have neither. And it seems
[01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:05.540]  that that's what our country is willing to do now, that we're willing to trade our liberty
[01:04:05.540 --> 01:04:12.540]  to be secure. I mean, Alex, I go crazy right now. I mean, I have to sue to prove that Jesse
[01:04:12.540 --> 01:04:18.420]  Ventura is not a threat just so I can fly commercially. I mean, what kind of nonsense
[01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:23.940]  is going on in this country? It's amazing. And the more liberty we give up, now they
[01:04:23.940 --> 01:04:27.940]  say the terror threat 10 years later is even worse. We need more of your rights. They spend
[01:04:27.940 --> 01:04:32.180]  trillions of dollars in the last 10 years in the domestic system. There's close to a
[01:04:32.180 --> 01:04:37.420]  million domestic private contractor spies. This is big business. And the truth is it's
[01:04:37.420 --> 01:04:41.780]  not going anywhere just like the prison industry until we say no. That's why they made drugs
[01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:46.300]  illegal so they could have a black market, bring them in and arrest their competition.
[01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:50.580]  For Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura is our guest. The book is 63 documents. The government
[01:04:50.580 --> 01:04:54.300]  doesn't want you to read. They'll be with us for the next 55 minutes. We're going to
[01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:58.500]  get into the whole bin Laden fable and get his take on it straight ahead. First day is
[01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:02.580]  doing interviews. We're honored to have this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:07.420]  consider buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation could easily
[01:05:07.420 --> 01:05:11.940]  double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energies are wants to control
[01:05:11.940 --> 01:05:16.820]  how much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true. Total government control
[01:05:16.820 --> 01:05:22.180]  of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of
[01:05:22.180 --> 01:05:27.180]  the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now new socialist legislation
[01:05:27.180 --> 01:05:31.620]  is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local
[01:05:31.620 --> 01:05:36.260]  grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages. Number
[01:05:36.260 --> 01:05:41.260]  five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks,
[01:05:41.260 --> 01:05:44.860]  I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of
[01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:52.060]  my old sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:06:00.180 --> 01:06:04.420]  It could never happen in America, but it's happening right now. Gas prices are exploding
[01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:08.820]  past the incomes of millions of families. As gas prices and crop failures push high

[01:07:05.460 --> 01:07:10.740]  day in America in more than 50 years. He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:07:10.740 --> 01:07:14.580]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of
[01:07:14.580 --> 01:07:18.220]  your health and your own family. Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions
[01:07:18.220 --> 01:07:22.980]  over the years. The crazy part is, he's usually right. You see, he predicted the collapse
[01:07:22.980 --> 01:07:27.740]  of GM, Danny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:07:27.740 --> 01:07:32.740]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy. Recently, he created a video, which
[01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:36.940]  you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet,
[01:07:36.940 --> 01:07:41.260]  it's a real eye-opener. I can't stress this enough. You should at least watch this free
[01:07:41.260 --> 01:07:45.260]  video online today. He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you
[01:07:45.260 --> 01:07:51.460]  can take to protect yourself. You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com. That's

[01:08:02.180 --> 01:08:24.520]  Thank you for joining us. It is Tuesday, the 10th day of May, 2011. Joining us from the
[01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:30.500]  Baja in California is former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura's new book, Climbing Up the
[01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:34.900]  New York Times Best Seller List. Jesse Ventura, 63 documents the government doesn't want you
[01:08:34.900 --> 01:08:41.100]  to read, available at infowars.com. Governor Ventura, out of the gates. We're now nine
[01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:47.860]  days into the killing of Ben Laden. We were told eight separate times he'd been killed.
[01:08:47.860 --> 01:08:52.860]  We have those articles up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com. They told us buried
[01:08:52.860 --> 01:08:57.100]  at sea. They won't show us the photo because, quote, conspiracy theorists, the president
[01:08:57.100 --> 01:09:01.140]  said on 60 minutes wouldn't believe it. That means people that have been lied to so much,
[01:09:01.140 --> 01:09:05.580]  they don't believe anything. And I know talking to you privately, that was your point. But
[01:09:05.580 --> 01:09:11.980]  Governor, looking at this situation and the way they've changed the story so many times,
[01:09:11.980 --> 01:09:13.980]  what's your take and view on this, Governor Ventura?
[01:09:13.980 --> 01:09:18.620]  Well, you know, it's hard to have a take and view on it for me, Alex, because as you said,
[01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:24.460]  I'm down here in the Baja and I get wind of stuff 48 hours or three days after it happens.
[01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:28.820]  So you guys know certainly more than I do. And, you know, I've been asked, people have
[01:09:28.820 --> 01:09:35.180]  said to me, well, could we have taken him alive and da-da-da. I said, I can't make any statement
[01:09:35.180 --> 01:09:39.900]  on that because you'd have to be there. You'd have to be part of the operation. If the Navy
[01:09:39.900 --> 01:09:45.140]  SEALs indeed did kill Ben Laden, well, they're the best unit that doing that because that's
[01:09:45.140 --> 01:09:51.460]  their expertise. And they could accomplish that mission if the mission were indeed true.
[01:09:51.460 --> 01:09:56.980]  Do I think it's true or not? I don't know, because my government has lied to me so often.
[01:09:56.980 --> 01:10:02.580]  I mean, look at when they lied about the death of Pat Tillman. They lied about the Jessica
[01:10:02.580 --> 01:10:08.500]  Lynch recovery. They lied about weapons of mass destruction. They lied about ties to
[01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:13.700]  al-Qaeda in Iraq. So really, the government has no credibility with me. So when I hear
[01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:20.220]  a story that they accomplished this and then there's so many other weird things about it,
[01:10:20.220 --> 01:10:26.660]  they buried him at sea 24 hours later. Well, why? And then they said it was Muslim religion.
[01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:32.220]  I might be wrong, but I think isn't that Jewish where you have to bury within 24 hours? I'm
[01:10:32.220 --> 01:10:38.140]  not an expert on religions, but I'm not sure that that's part of the Muslim religion or
[01:10:38.140 --> 01:10:41.940]  not. No, the imams have come out and said that you need to be buried after you've been
[01:10:41.940 --> 01:10:49.100]  washed, facing Mecca, and that burial at sea is a big no-no. Well, okay, then there you
[01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:55.140]  got it. So why did they bury him at sea? I guess because the Navy caught him. That's
[01:10:55.140 --> 01:11:01.500]  the only thing I could come up with. But no, they won't show us photos. They're just telling
[01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:08.180]  us he's dead. And I guess it's worked so many times before, Alex. Why wouldn't it work again?
[01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:15.140]  Well, you bring up the point of lies. It came out last Wednesday that White House did not
[01:11:15.140 --> 01:11:21.860]  watch the live killing. Then they said he fought back and the seals had to kill him. Then they
[01:11:21.860 --> 01:11:26.980]  said he didn't fight back. They took him out and then killed him. Then they said he used his wife
[01:11:26.980 --> 01:11:32.060]  as a human shield. And they said that didn't happen. And then they won't show us the body. I
[01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:39.420]  mean, this is very, very, very bizarre. But I can tell you this, Alex, as far as the operational
[01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:46.900]  end, on the ground, being the knuckle-draggers, the seals that did the op, it shows me that
[01:11:46.900 --> 01:11:54.340]  policy hasn't changed at all since Vietnam. Because in Vietnam, our standard policy, if we were
[01:11:54.340 --> 01:12:00.460]  going to do a kidnapping or going to do something of this order, would be offer the person one
[01:12:00.460 --> 01:12:07.020]  time. And if the person doesn't fully cooperate, you then take them out. You eliminate them.
[01:12:07.020 --> 01:12:14.580]  And it's that quick. So whoever the operator, if it indeed happened, as they said it went down,
[01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:21.860]  whoever the operational leader on the ground was, I fully could see why he would be taken out
[01:12:21.860 --> 01:12:27.260]  that quickly, because that's no different than what it was in Vietnam. That you give one opportunity,
[01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:31.940]  and if they so choose to not exercise that opportunity, then you eliminate them.
[01:12:31.940 --> 01:12:37.580]  Well, what's amazing is they showed this White House situation room and said that they were
[01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:43.100]  watching bin Laden being killed. Then they said, actually, that the video cut out for 24 minutes,
[01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:48.620]  and they didn't watch it. And they lied about that. And then Jessica Lynch, for three days,
[01:12:48.620 --> 01:12:52.300]  she's there at the hospital. The Iraqis have pulled out. The doctors go and say,
[01:12:52.300 --> 01:12:57.420]  please come here and get her. Jerry Bruckheimer gets on satellite feed. The director scripts how
[01:12:57.420 --> 01:13:03.300]  to do this staged rescue. Turns out she didn't fight in the convoy. The other guys did. And then
[01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:07.620]  magically, those guys all died in a week getting shot in the head or grounding or running off the
[01:13:07.620 --> 01:13:13.460]  road. With Pat Tillman, he writes letters home saying, I'm coming home to be anti-war. He gets
[01:13:13.460 --> 01:13:18.500]  shot three times in the head at close range. They claim that he was killed by Al Qaeda till the Army
[01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:23.860]  Coroner report came out saying foul play was shown. I mean, you're at the Gulf of Tonkin. The list goes
[01:13:23.860 --> 01:13:30.980]  on and on. So bottom line, I mean, this looks like an election ploy stunt. And I don't believe a word
[01:13:30.980 --> 01:13:37.060]  of it. What's your view? Well, again, I don't know. I got to delve into it. I got to start reading on
[01:13:37.060 --> 01:13:42.620]  it when I get back to the States. And I'll make a few phone calls with people that I know and see
[01:13:42.620 --> 01:13:49.020]  what I can tap on the behind the scenes. I'm still a bit connected to the SEAL units. And I can't
[01:13:49.020 --> 01:13:55.180]  believe that they would knowingly participate in a fraud. But then again, I guess if you're ordered to
[01:13:55.180 --> 01:14:00.860]  do something, you have to do what you're ordered to do. You know, but I can't see a SEAL platoon
[01:14:00.860 --> 01:14:07.140]  actively participating in a fraud unless they pull the fraud on them too. And maybe they had some
[01:14:07.140 --> 01:14:12.140]  guy there that looked like Ben Laden and did him in. I don't know. Well, that's exactly how they
[01:14:12.140 --> 01:14:18.300]  operate. That's exactly they have decoys, people that are set up. And now they release this video
[01:14:18.300 --> 01:14:25.100]  of the five videos, four of them were previously released videos. We've gone and shown the exact
[01:14:25.100 --> 01:14:31.020]  same video was released, one of them four years ago. And but they cut the audio out so it wouldn't
[01:14:31.020 --> 01:14:37.420]  be too obvious. And the one video that's new is an old guy from the side whose ears don't even look
[01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:43.980]  like Ben Laden supposedly watching Ben Laden on TV. Yeah, I did see that photograph last night and
[01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:49.980]  I kind of chuckled at it and I thought that's him. And then I thought to myself, well, then what they
[01:14:49.980 --> 01:14:54.140]  really did was just shot an old man in his bed, right? We're sitting there with his wives.
[01:14:56.860 --> 01:15:01.740]  I don't know. Again, I can't comment on what happened on the ground because I'm not privy to
[01:15:01.740 --> 01:15:07.340]  anything that went down with the actual platoon over there. But they could do it, make it certainly
[01:15:07.340 --> 01:15:15.500]  accomplish it if it was real, whether it's real or not, Alex, I have no way of knowing. But you're
[01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:20.220]  saying that you do question the official story because you've been lied to so much. Yeah,
[01:15:20.220 --> 01:15:25.420]  absolutely. Absolutely. I mean, for the last decade, it's been nothing but lies, whether it's
[01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:30.860]  the Bush administration or the Obama administration, it's why after life, like I said, we're to the
[01:15:30.860 --> 01:15:37.260]  point now, Alex, I have to go to court to be able to fly in my own country. What kind of country
[01:15:37.260 --> 01:15:44.860]  is that when you got to go to court to be able to fly and not be searched to prove you're innocent
[01:15:44.860 --> 01:15:49.820]  every time you go to an airport? It's amazing. They've now announced today, and it was actually
[01:15:49.820 --> 01:15:54.300]  set up months ago, the new alert system was really integrated in years ago. They're going to be
[01:15:54.300 --> 01:16:00.940]  breaking out on smartphones, cell phones, computers, radio, TV with government alerts, messages from
[01:16:00.940 --> 01:16:10.060]  the president forcing you to watch them, 9,000 locations, 800 Walmarts. Walls are getting telescreens
[01:16:10.060 --> 01:16:15.660]  saying nobody's safe, watch your neighbor, trust no one but government. I mean, is that not 1984,
[01:16:15.660 --> 01:16:21.580]  Governor? I don't know. Why are they doing that, Alex? What are we supposed to do? We're all supposed
[01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:27.180]  to go to Wal-Mart and watch them on TV when they come on? Well, it's about them forcing their way
[01:16:27.180 --> 01:16:33.740]  into our lives. Chucky Schumer and now Amtrex, it looks like they're going to agree, as well as
[01:16:33.740 --> 01:16:39.180]  other terminals around the country, to have TSA sticking their hands down our pants. Have you
[01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:43.180]  seen the new video of the six-year-old having them stick their hands on our pants or the one-year-old
[01:16:43.180 --> 01:16:48.460]  baby with them pulling the diaper off? No, I didn't see the one-year-old baby with the diaper, but I
[01:16:48.460 --> 01:16:54.140]  did see the young child. I was on with Lou Dobbs that particular day right before I left to go back
[01:16:54.140 --> 01:17:01.100]  to Mexico on the book tour, and Lou was irate over it, and he thanked me for bringing my lawsuit
[01:17:01.100 --> 01:17:06.540]  on behalf of millions of Americans, including himself, for standing up for this stuff. But
[01:17:06.540 --> 01:17:12.540]  you know, that's about all you can do. I mean, we just got to be vigilant, Alex, and not accept
[01:17:12.540 --> 01:17:19.340]  this as normal behavior and what's supposed to be a free country. Well, how could TSA, if there were
[01:17:19.340 --> 01:17:26.380]  real terrorists, protect cornfields, rural areas, highways, hundreds of thousands of miles of train,
[01:17:27.180 --> 01:17:32.940]  they claim the al-Qaeda documents that the boogeyman bin Laden had said they want to
[01:17:33.740 --> 01:17:38.860]  go up and derail trains. So how is searching everybody that gets on trains and putting them
[01:17:38.860 --> 01:17:44.060]  through a no-ride list, how is that going to stop al-Qaeda? I mean, how are they going to stop anybody?
[01:17:44.060 --> 01:17:51.180]  How many al-Qaeda are there? I mean, I'm trying to figure out, are they trying to make us believe
[01:17:51.180 --> 01:17:55.900]  that there's like millions of them out there? No, they claim there's less than 100 in Afghanistan,
[01:17:56.460 --> 01:18:02.300]  less than 100 in Pakistan, maybe 100. Well, that means there's more hell's angels than there are,
[01:18:02.300 --> 01:18:05.980]  al-Qaeda, right? Well, also, Jesse, let me ask you this question.
[01:18:05.980 --> 01:18:10.780]  So, Alex? Absolutely. There's more hell's angels than there are, al-Qaeda, then.
[01:18:10.780 --> 01:18:17.660]  Well, here's another question. If they say he didn't resist and that the seals got him and then
[01:18:17.660 --> 01:18:22.860]  executed him, why if he's the greatest intelligence asset in the world, knows where all the al-Qaeda
[01:18:22.860 --> 01:18:29.500]  bodies are buried, knows the next attack, why execute Osama bin Laden? And they're telling
[01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:33.820]  us torture is great and torture is wonderful because it gets data. Well, then why not take
[01:18:33.820 --> 01:18:39.100]  bin Laden and torture him? Exactly. Well, again, though, that's a question that would happen in
[01:18:39.100 --> 01:18:44.780]  the field. And I can understand the seal operative because if it was the same as Vietnam, if you
[01:18:44.780 --> 01:18:50.940]  give them one opportunity, if they fail to do that, you eliminate them pretty much. And that's
[01:18:50.940 --> 01:18:56.460]  unconventional warfare. And that's what the seals are about. It's not conventional warfare. And
[01:18:57.020 --> 01:19:01.900]  but I certainly would rather capture him. Absolutely. This guy would know everything
[01:19:01.900 --> 01:19:07.420]  supposedly about al-Qaeda. Why wouldn't you attempt to capture him first so that you could gain
[01:19:07.420 --> 01:19:14.060]  knowledge from this guy or to warrant off other attacks or whatever it might be? It seems stupid
[01:19:14.060 --> 01:19:20.060]  to just to plain executed him without trying to at first capture him. But again, Jesse, let me stop
[01:19:20.060 --> 01:19:24.780]  you. I can't speak for the guys on the ground who actually did the op. I don't know. Sure. But
[01:19:24.780 --> 01:19:30.540]  my point is, sir, they changed the story. First, they said he resisted, fired at them, that the
[01:19:30.540 --> 01:19:34.380]  helicopter got hurt by being fired at, then they changed that. Then he uses his wife as a shield.
[01:19:34.380 --> 01:19:39.420]  Then they said no. Now they say he didn't resist. They took him and executed him. They had him.
[01:19:39.420 --> 01:19:44.380]  They they executed him. And the word is, if you believe he was killed, he had knowledge of being
[01:19:44.380 --> 01:19:50.700]  CIA in the 80s and 90s. Clinton had a chance to get him in 96 in Sudan, and they didn't want that
[01:19:50.700 --> 01:19:55.020]  out. So they were ordered to killing. Then Obama said, no, we didn't order him to be killed. So
[01:19:55.020 --> 01:19:58.940]  the point is we're being lied to. They've changed the stories. We'll be right back with Governor
[01:19:58.940 --> 01:20:04.700]  Jesse Ventura with more. If you suffer from poor sleep, you need my pillow, guaranteed to be the

[01:21:00.940 --> 01:21:06.780]  Food prices are spiraling out of control. In order to survive, you will soon need to produce some or
[01:21:06.780 --> 01:21:12.380]  all of your own food in your backyard or small farm. Many years ago, sought after radio guest
[01:21:12.380 --> 01:21:17.500]  Marjorie Wildcraft and her family began working to find the easiest ways to grow food for the
[01:21:17.500 --> 01:21:22.700]  crisis we are now facing. Marjorie created a video that is the fastest way to learn how to grow
[01:21:22.700 --> 01:21:27.340]  food. You'll learn the most efficient gardening methods, myths and truths of orchards and edible
[01:21:27.340 --> 01:21:32.220]  landscaping, effective predator protection, and even home butchering. Everyone is talking about
[01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:37.820]  Marjorie's DVD and it's highly recommended by Jim Rawls, Jack Spurko, and Boutiful Gardens.
[01:21:37.820 --> 01:21:42.940]  Read her free reports on how to have a green thumb making free fertilizer and answers the
[01:21:42.940 --> 01:21:48.140]  question, do you need a gun to garden? If you want the security, savings, and freedom of food

[01:22:02.460 --> 01:22:07.820]  tsunami, and nuclear disaster that killed thousands of Japanese citizens is nothing compared to the
[01:22:07.820 --> 01:22:12.700]  devastation that could be caused by hyperinflation that will soon hit the United States and could
[01:22:12.700 --> 01:22:17.820]  lead to millions of Americans becoming homeless, all caused by the devalued U.S. dollar. While
[01:22:17.820 --> 01:22:22.700]  the mainstream media continues to ignore inflation, our friends at the National Inflation Association
[01:22:22.700 --> 01:22:27.340]  provide a free weekly newsletter that educates Americans of the facts and truth about the U.S.
[01:22:27.340 --> 01:22:33.740]  economy and inflation. I urge you to sign up at the NIA free newsletter at www.inflation.us
[01:22:33.740 --> 01:22:38.620]  to learn how you can not only survive but prosper during the upcoming hyperinflation crisis.
[01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:43.500]  Silver has more than doubled since the NIA declared Silver the best investment for the next decade
[01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:49.020]  on inflation.us. The NIA's team of expert economists are happy to answer any economic
[01:22:49.020 --> 01:22:53.580]  questions you have about inflation, debt, currencies, real estate, precious metals,

[01:23:04.220 --> 01:23:11.500]  Keep your wheels moving with pre-pass, bypass way stations, fly by port of entry facilities,
[01:23:11.500 --> 01:23:16.860]  stay moving at highway speed while the guy without pre-pass waits in line.

[01:24:05.260 --> 01:24:09.660]  The Alex Jones Show because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:24:14.460 --> 01:24:17.580]  Governor Ventura and I were just talking during the break and
[01:24:17.580 --> 01:24:22.700]  he was having time to really cogitate on the whole Bin Laden situation. He takes off part
[01:24:22.700 --> 01:24:28.620]  of the year and goes down and writes books and researches down in the Baja, Mexico, and surfs.
[01:24:28.620 --> 01:24:31.900]  But he was going, didn't Benazir Bhutto, the president of Pakistan, come out and say he'd
[01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:37.260]  been killed? And then she got killed a week later at Execution Style. And Pakistani intelligence,
[01:24:37.260 --> 01:24:43.020]  former head told me here, it was Cheney had her killed. And wasn't it in 2003 on the election,
[01:24:43.020 --> 01:24:47.260]  we had Madeleine Albright come out and say he was dead and that Bush was thinking about rolling
[01:24:47.260 --> 01:24:52.540]  him out. Then Walter Cronkite did it, then Teresa Heinz-Kerry did it, and so Bush backed off.
[01:24:52.540 --> 01:24:58.300]  I had Steve Pachennick, the guy that co-wrote the books with, of course, the very famous
[01:24:58.940 --> 01:25:04.860]  writer Tom Clancy. He was the head of Black Op Operations, worked with the SEALs in psychological
[01:25:04.860 --> 01:25:10.460]  warfare, the Delta Force. He told me in April 2002, Governor, that he died of kidney failure and
[01:25:10.460 --> 01:25:15.580]  they were going to roll him out later claiming that we'd killed him. So with all those high-powered
[01:25:15.580 --> 01:25:20.220]  people saying that, and then them changing the story so much, what does your gut tell you? I
[01:25:20.220 --> 01:25:26.940]  mean, you said... Well, again, it causes me concern over the fact that this guy supposedly was on a
[01:25:26.940 --> 01:25:33.740]  dialysis machine way back 10 years ago. How could he survive that long if he needed dialysis
[01:25:33.740 --> 01:25:39.340]  treatments all the time? I mean, I don't know too many people that are that overly active if they
[01:25:39.340 --> 01:25:47.340]  require dialysis treatment on a regular basis. Well, he had several diseases that on average
[01:25:47.340 --> 01:25:54.140]  people die within two years. The longest lived are six, total renal failure. That's why even
[01:25:54.140 --> 01:25:59.900]  CBS News reported he was at the American Hospital in, quote, Dubai being treated by American doctors,
[01:25:59.900 --> 01:26:05.820]  and even Dan Rather went and interviewed him, and this was just months before 9-11. I mean,
[01:26:05.820 --> 01:26:12.460]  he was near death then. Yeah, and so I don't know. I don't know what to believe, Alex. That's the
[01:26:12.460 --> 01:26:18.220]  disturbing thing about being a United States citizen today is the fact that you can't believe
[01:26:18.220 --> 01:26:23.260]  mainstream media because mainstream media is totally bought and sold and they're in bed with
[01:26:23.260 --> 01:26:29.500]  the government, and that's their job now is to simply report what the government wants us told.
[01:26:29.500 --> 01:26:35.660]  And in light of that fact, you have to learn everything on shows like yours and on the internet
[01:26:35.660 --> 01:26:41.660]  and all these other alternative places where you can attempt to get through them and learn the truth.
[01:26:41.660 --> 01:26:47.340]  But again, everyone's susceptible to being misled no matter where it is, be it the internet or
[01:26:47.340 --> 01:26:52.860]  where else. So it really boggles the mind on trying to figure it out. That's why I don't like to make
[01:26:52.860 --> 01:26:59.100]  rash decisions on it. I like to look at the thing, take my time and do my own studying rather than
[01:26:59.100 --> 01:27:04.860]  rather than just simply reacting to what media says to me. Well, we're going to get a headline
[01:27:04.860 --> 01:27:10.940]  out at infowars.com. My writer was just in here during the break trying to get an answer for me
[01:27:10.940 --> 01:27:16.060]  with what to go with. Obviously, it's big news. Your opinion is highly valued out there by
[01:27:16.060 --> 01:27:22.140]  independents and people that love liberty. And I think the fair headline is Governor Jesse Ventura
[01:27:22.140 --> 01:27:30.060]  or Jesse Ventura. I've been lied to so much. I question or I need more information. I mean,
[01:27:30.060 --> 01:27:35.660]  what should the headline be? I've been lied to so much. I question everything the government tells
[01:27:35.660 --> 01:27:41.500]  me. It's not simple, Alex. And you went on to question they lied about Lynch and did a Jerry
[01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:50.380]  Bruckheimer production about the murder of Pat Tillman, which is unconscionable when they tried
[01:27:50.380 --> 01:27:57.020]  to turn that into a political staged deal to support their war in political position. Unbelievable.
[01:27:57.740 --> 01:28:03.740]  They've lied so often about so many things. WMDs. I don't know what to believe. WMDs, fake documents
[01:28:03.740 --> 01:28:08.940]  on that. It turned out they ordered, the U.S. had ordered England and the White House memo
[01:28:08.940 --> 01:28:13.900]  to fix intelligence along with us that we were going to go ahead and go to war. Yeah, exactly.
[01:28:13.900 --> 01:28:19.260]  I mean, we've been getting lied to for the most of the last decade. It's unbelievable. So,
[01:28:19.260 --> 01:28:25.420]  the simple thing is, I don't know what to believe because my government lies to me. They have no
[01:28:25.420 --> 01:28:29.980]  credibility with me. Let me expand on that. We're about to go to break with a long segment coming
[01:28:29.980 --> 01:28:37.180]  up. But the New York Post on May 7th ran a headline, The Truth Hurts. And they said that
[01:28:37.180 --> 01:28:42.220]  Governor Jesse Ventura has since reversed his position that he believed bin Laden was dead.
[01:28:42.220 --> 01:28:45.820]  Well, you were just going off what even mainline news was saying that it was believed he was dead.
[01:28:45.820 --> 01:28:50.300]  And they said he's since reversed his position. I then searched and I knew you were in Mexico.
[01:28:50.300 --> 01:28:55.980]  There was no news on you in over a month since you'd been in Mexico. And I looked for you
[01:28:55.980 --> 01:29:00.860]  doing a reversal on bin Laden. You never did it. So, here they are, correct me if I'm wrong,
[01:29:00.860 --> 01:29:06.620]  saying you reversed yourself when you never did it. No, I've never made it. Alex, this is the
[01:29:06.620 --> 01:29:11.260]  first day I've done an interview since my book tour and you were on my book tour. That's what,
[01:29:11.260 --> 01:29:17.180]  three, four weeks ago? Time magazine's out saying that I've reversed myself now that they've
[01:29:18.220 --> 01:29:22.300]  released these videos, which a bunch of them are old or already released. It says, well,
[01:29:22.300 --> 01:29:27.420]  Jones now has to basically admit he's wrong. I did not do that. I'm right. I know it's totally
[01:29:27.420 --> 01:29:32.780]  fake. I predicted all this years ago, but that's what they do. They think their readers are a
[01:29:32.780 --> 01:29:37.820]  bunch of idiots. And that's why the mainstream media is dying. Governor Jesse Ventura, folks,
[01:29:37.820 --> 01:29:42.300]  this book is really waking a lot of folks up available at infowars.com. The book is doing
[01:29:42.300 --> 01:29:47.340]  extremely well. That's why he's back. We'll talk about the huge success of 63 documents the government
[01:29:47.340 --> 01:29:52.140]  doesn't want you to read with Governor Jesse Ventura on the other side. Stay. We're on the march,
[01:29:52.140 --> 01:29:57.420]  the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:30:02.300 --> 01:30:06.300]  Hi, folks. This is Alex Jones. And I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.

[01:30:56.540 --> 01:31:07.660]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance to not
[01:31:07.660 --> 01:31:12.780]  relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath
[01:31:12.780 --> 01:31:18.940]  Americans at home. I've turned an endless influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[01:31:18.940 --> 01:31:25.260]  calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:31:25.260 --> 01:31:31.020]  Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel held
[01:31:31.020 --> 01:31:36.140]  bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner,
[01:31:36.140 --> 01:31:40.460]  Bernanke, their arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying,
[01:31:40.460 --> 01:31:45.100]  who do we make the check out to? Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington,
[01:31:45.100 --> 01:31:52.140]  D.C. we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Full of the Republic on DVD

[01:32:00.060 --> 01:32:04.620]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:32:04.620 --> 01:32:09.820]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two,
[01:32:09.820 --> 01:32:14.700]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:32:14.700 --> 01:32:20.380]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:32:20.380 --> 01:32:25.340]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now
[01:32:25.340 --> 01:32:30.780]  new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always
[01:32:30.780 --> 01:32:35.260]  a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related

[01:32:59.660 --> 01:33:20.860]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live with former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura.
[01:33:20.860 --> 01:33:26.060]  I'm Alex Jones and the website is WeAin'tGotTimeToBleed.com.
[01:33:26.060 --> 01:33:32.940]  WeAin'tGotTimeToBleed.com. Our sites are infowars.com and prisonplanet.tv.
[01:33:33.900 --> 01:33:44.140]  Again, I'm here reading from CBSNews.com where they admitted the White House issued a photo of
[01:33:44.140 --> 01:33:50.300]  them in the situation room watching the operation. Now it turns out they have to admit they watched
[01:33:50.300 --> 01:33:54.460]  nothing. The whole thing was a stage fake. But you can look at the photo with Hillary with her
[01:33:54.460 --> 01:34:00.940]  hand over her mouth. Obama all looking tough. They clearly scripted this entire thing. And
[01:34:00.940 --> 01:34:06.460]  Governor, just going over more of the lies we've been told. I mean, government is constantly being
[01:34:06.460 --> 01:34:13.020]  caught in lies. And I think it's common sense to question. You know what bothers me? Here's what
[01:34:13.020 --> 01:34:21.660]  troubles me, Alex, about the lying. Is that when we lie to them, we go to jail. It's that simple.
[01:34:21.660 --> 01:34:27.020]  I mean, look at right now in baseball, you got Barry Bonds. He might go to jail. You got Roger
[01:34:27.020 --> 01:34:33.340]  Clemens. He might go to jail. And of course, Martha Stewart did go to jail. And she didn't go for
[01:34:33.340 --> 01:34:38.940]  insider trading. She went to jail for lying to the government. So that's one thing that really
[01:34:38.940 --> 01:34:45.740]  disturbs me. The government can lie to us and there's no repercussions to them. They do it
[01:34:45.740 --> 01:34:52.780]  all the time. And yet when we lie to them, we face jail time. Or when they say we lie, I mean,
[01:34:52.780 --> 01:34:57.820]  these new federal laws they've had the last decade have put hundreds of thousands of people in prison
[01:34:57.820 --> 01:35:03.980]  where you've actually done nothing wrong. But then they claim that you lied on your finances and they
[01:35:03.980 --> 01:35:09.980]  find $10 more or $10 less than you said. And they go, technically, you lied. It doesn't matter
[01:35:09.980 --> 01:35:14.700]  that it's really a mistake. You go to prison. Well, you know, like I said, you got the high
[01:35:14.700 --> 01:35:21.820]  profile cases like baseball. And I always question, what is steroid use in baseball have to do with
[01:35:21.820 --> 01:35:28.460]  the government? Nothing. You know, and so it's that whole premise that if we lie to them, we go
[01:35:28.460 --> 01:35:35.580]  to jail. And yet it seems every politician in this country lying must be the major course they take
[01:35:35.580 --> 01:35:41.980]  in college. I don't know. I didn't go to college, Alex. Do they have a course on lying? Well,
[01:35:41.980 --> 01:35:47.020]  what they've done is they've tried to break our will and just train us to accept total corruption.
[01:35:47.020 --> 01:35:53.420]  I want to shift gears into another facet of this whole bin Laden hoax that's being used to roll out
[01:35:53.420 --> 01:35:58.700]  even more tyranny. They're now saying you've got to give up even more rights. Al Qaeda attacks are
[01:35:58.700 --> 01:36:05.020]  imminent. They're going to attack everything. They've got 160 buried nukes, KSM, who they've
[01:36:05.020 --> 01:36:09.580]  been torturing for what is it, six years now, who confessed to bombing buildings that were built
[01:36:09.580 --> 01:36:19.500]  after he was kidnapped or given rendition. KSM, two weeks before 9-11, they released
[01:36:19.500 --> 01:36:25.420]  a statement claiming KSM said there are buried nukes in Europe in the U.S. and bin Laden will
[01:36:25.420 --> 01:36:32.140]  detonate them. He has orders to detonate them if he is killed. Now, the Associated Press,
[01:36:32.140 --> 01:36:37.660]  in fact, let's pull that up on screen, KSM, nukes buried in America. The mainstream media
[01:36:37.660 --> 01:36:43.100]  is reporting nukes buried in Europe and America from KSM. Bin Laden knows where they're buried.
[01:36:43.100 --> 01:36:49.180]  The Navy seals or ordered not to kill him. That's now the official story. But then they do kill him
[01:36:49.180 --> 01:36:54.060]  as if they wouldn't follow their orders. And Dick Cheney comes out and says Obama should
[01:36:54.060 --> 01:37:03.500]  reinstate waterboarding. He told Fox Sunday. He told Chris Wallace that on Fox, former Vice
[01:37:03.500 --> 01:37:09.740]  President Dick Cheney said Sunday that President Barack Obama should put waterboarding back on
[01:37:09.740 --> 01:37:14.460]  the table. And then I want to shift to this article by Washington's blog. U.S. government
[01:37:14.460 --> 01:37:19.420]  used communist torture techniques specifically designed to produce false confessions. And then
[01:37:19.420 --> 01:37:27.340]  he has links to the Navy SEAL training and the Army training. And it says that they now have
[01:37:27.340 --> 01:37:33.900]  announced as of 2009 and that Senator Levin is commenting on the Senate Armed Services Committee
[01:37:33.900 --> 01:37:39.980]  report on torture, declassified today, drops the following bombshell that the survival
[01:37:39.980 --> 01:37:43.820]  evasion resistance. This is when you said years ago, you know, you talk about how you've been
[01:37:43.820 --> 01:37:48.620]  waterboarded and it is torture and that you'd be happy to waterboard Dick Cheney, that they're
[01:37:48.620 --> 01:37:56.140]  actually using the SERE techniques that SEALs and other special forces are put through in the
[01:37:56.140 --> 01:38:02.220]  basic training now of advanced troops in this survival evasion resistance. They're not teaching
[01:38:02.220 --> 01:38:07.660]  them how to take the torture. They're teaching them how to torture now that was declassified
[01:38:08.620 --> 01:38:13.500]  last week. Governor, what do you say about Cheney pushing this and them now training
[01:38:13.500 --> 01:38:18.780]  the troops how to torture? Well, like I said before, Dick Cheney should be a man of his word
[01:38:18.780 --> 01:38:25.580]  and he should try it first before he recommends it. It's that simple. Dick Cheney needs to lie
[01:38:25.580 --> 01:38:30.700]  down and be waterboarded. And that way he'll know what he's talking about because right now
[01:38:30.700 --> 01:38:34.860]  Dick Cheney speaks out of ignorance. He doesn't know what he's talking about because he's never
[01:38:34.860 --> 01:38:40.620]  had it done to him. So I think the first thing Dick Cheney should do is volunteer to have it done.
[01:38:41.180 --> 01:38:47.180]  I just read in today's paper that he he's contemplating whether he needs a new heart or not.
[01:38:47.820 --> 01:38:51.740]  Well, if he gets waterboarded, he won't have to make that decision anymore.
[01:38:51.740 --> 01:38:57.900]  What do you make of them taking this training that you talked about going through survival,
[01:38:57.900 --> 01:39:03.740]  evasion resistance? Searschool was required back when I was in the Navy. If you were going anywhere
[01:39:03.740 --> 01:39:09.580]  into a combat zone, they required you to pass successfully complete Searschool, which was
[01:39:09.580 --> 01:39:14.940]  called survival escape resistance and evasion. Yeah, now that's where you were essentially
[01:39:14.940 --> 01:39:23.420]  waterboarded. Everybody was. And you spent 24 hours in a mock POW camp and all of this stuff
[01:39:23.420 --> 01:39:28.620]  because you never knew, I guess, if you were going to face that as a reality after you deployed.
[01:39:30.220 --> 01:39:37.100]  As far as teaching people how to do those techniques, I think that's very, very wrong
[01:39:37.100 --> 01:39:43.500]  because if you're involved in a war, you're supposed to treat your enemy combatant with a
[01:39:43.500 --> 01:39:50.220]  certain amount of respect if they've surrendered to you. And I think that as a country, we should
[01:39:50.220 --> 01:39:56.140]  always be taking the high ground and for Dick Cheney to come out and advocate torture again.
[01:39:56.140 --> 01:40:02.140]  Well, that means he's putting us on the low ground again, because then when somebody tortures us
[01:40:02.140 --> 01:40:08.140]  or when somebody does something to us, we will have no recourse or no high ground position to
[01:40:08.140 --> 01:40:14.540]  take anymore because the fact is we do it. So therefore, how can we be morally on high ground
[01:40:14.540 --> 01:40:21.340]  at all? And I dig to ask the question, here's a guy with five deferments from the military
[01:40:21.340 --> 01:40:27.500]  telling us how what foreign policy we should have and how we should operate with enemy combatants
[01:40:27.500 --> 01:40:33.660]  or enemy soldiers or everything like that. A guy who he himself was a coward and got five
[01:40:33.660 --> 01:40:41.100]  deferments from the Vietnam War, how dare him? And how dare anybody even give this guy to bother
[01:40:41.100 --> 01:40:46.780]  to listen to him? Is that bold enough for you, Alex? Yes, sir, it is bold and expanding on that.
[01:40:46.780 --> 01:40:50.380]  Bush wrote a book last year admitting he ordered torture. He'd do it again.
[01:40:50.380 --> 01:40:55.500]  The Army's own report from Abu Ghraib admits small children were raped in front of their parents.
[01:40:55.500 --> 01:41:00.460]  That's NBC News. You want to pull up the full report. You got the will to read it, listeners.
[01:41:00.460 --> 01:41:04.620]  This is what the good guys supposedly do, but they're not even worried about moral high ground.
[01:41:04.620 --> 01:41:09.020]  When foreigners do torture, it's horrible. It's terrible. They're dastardly. They're evil.
[01:41:09.020 --> 01:41:14.940]  But then simultaneously, it's good when we do it. They're trying to warp our minds. But here it is.
[01:41:14.940 --> 01:41:20.700]  It says, with last week's release of Department of Justice legal counsel opinions, it is now
[01:41:20.700 --> 01:41:26.300]  widely known that Bush administration officials distorted survival, evasion, resistance and escape
[01:41:26.300 --> 01:41:30.700]  training, a legitimate program used by the military to train our troops to resist
[01:41:31.260 --> 01:41:37.500]  abusive enemy interrogations by authorizing abusive techniques from the SERE Sears training
[01:41:37.500 --> 01:41:42.380]  for use in attaining interrogations. So the point is, what was declassified last week is,
[01:41:43.180 --> 01:41:48.300]  everybody getting Sears training at special forces level now, it's not how to resist it.
[01:41:48.300 --> 01:41:51.500]  It's how to do it. They're building an army of torturers.
[01:41:51.500 --> 01:41:58.380]  Well, then we should be hanging our head in shame because that's not, I don't care what happens,
[01:41:58.380 --> 01:42:02.300]  that is not what the United States of America is supposed to be about, Alex.
[01:42:02.860 --> 01:42:09.660]  And like I said, if we lose all our moral high ground, then we certainly have lost the war on
[01:42:09.660 --> 01:42:15.660]  terror because, you know, when our constitution and our bill of rights don't exist anymore,
[01:42:15.660 --> 01:42:20.540]  well that means the terrorists have won. But I think that that happens internally. It doesn't
[01:42:20.540 --> 01:42:24.700]  happen from the terrorists. I think the terrorists are being used as an excuse.
[01:42:24.700 --> 01:42:28.380]  Well, I think there's no doubt whoever the terrorists are, and we know it's Black Ops,
[01:42:28.380 --> 01:42:31.580]  private corporate criminal networks that are doing the lion's share of it,
[01:42:32.700 --> 01:42:37.500]  that the terrorists have won. And the government, the media are terrorizing us.
[01:42:38.620 --> 01:42:43.100]  What's your take, Governor, on we were told bin Laden's been killed after nine and a half years,
[01:42:43.100 --> 01:42:47.980]  and now they say, we got to take more rights. The terror threats greater. Well, then that means
[01:42:47.980 --> 01:42:52.140]  as they kill more, then it makes more of a threat. I mean, when does this end?
[01:42:52.140 --> 01:42:57.020]  Well, I think the big, here's a question I want to ask. Now that we've killed bin Laden,
[01:42:57.020 --> 01:43:04.380]  can't we bring all the troops home? Yes. Isn't it time for us to now pack up and come home?
[01:43:04.380 --> 01:43:11.020]  Isn't the war over? If we indeed, if this was indeed the man who masterminded 9-11,
[01:43:12.060 --> 01:43:17.180]  and we've now killed him, like they told us that they have on May 1st or whatever the date was,
[01:43:17.180 --> 01:43:23.420]  well, then shouldn't we be getting immediate withdrawal from both Iraq and Afghanistan and
[01:43:23.420 --> 01:43:30.940]  bring all our men and women home? Incredible. Incredible. Let me raise another point, Jim.
[01:43:30.940 --> 01:43:36.460]  I mean, is that unreasonable? No, it's not. It seems to me now we won the war. Isn't this
[01:43:36.460 --> 01:43:42.060]  the ultimate thing was to get the guy that allegedly did 9-11? Well, now they're saying that
[01:43:42.060 --> 01:43:47.900]  although, you know, I'll tell you something, Alex, we needed to capture bin Laden. You know why? We
[01:43:47.900 --> 01:43:55.820]  needed to find out how he achieved 9-11 because what happened on 9-11, I believe today it was not
[01:43:55.820 --> 01:44:02.300]  a controlled demolition. It was not nanothermite and it certainly was not the pancake effect of
[01:44:02.300 --> 01:44:09.900]  two planes hitting a building. There was something else in play there, Alex. There was a weapon in
[01:44:09.900 --> 01:44:16.060]  play that day that I don't even know what it is, but I can equate it to being like a microwave.
[01:44:16.060 --> 01:44:20.460]  You know how you can take a piece of chicken and put it on a paper plate and stick it in
[01:44:20.460 --> 01:44:26.380]  the microwave and the chicken will burn but the paper plate won't? Yes. Well, something happened
[01:44:26.380 --> 01:44:32.940]  that day equivalent to a microwave and by capturing bin Laden, maybe we could find out what weapon he
[01:44:32.940 --> 01:44:41.100]  truly has because I just learned there were 1,400 cars toasted that day all over the streets of
[01:44:41.100 --> 01:44:46.380]  Manhattan. No, no, that's right. Cars that didn't have anything fall on them were completely fried
[01:44:46.380 --> 01:44:51.020]  but expanding just like a secret helicopter reportedly crashed. We know they're 30 years
[01:44:51.020 --> 01:44:55.580]  advanced what they really have but there's another area that if you look at it. British
[01:44:55.580 --> 01:44:59.820]  physicists and others and it turns out the government did measure this. You can confirm it.
[01:44:59.820 --> 01:45:07.900]  Radioactive isotopes used in small nukes were picked up in levels off the charts and around
[01:45:07.900 --> 01:45:14.620]  the towers. No, I don't buy that. I don't buy that. Nukes were not used. Well, the radiation was
[01:45:14.620 --> 01:45:21.660]  picked up. No, I don't buy it because when those towers went down there was less
[01:45:21.660 --> 01:45:30.620]  less impact than when they brought down the Superdome in Seattle and there should have been way
[01:45:30.620 --> 01:45:38.140]  more. Those towers literally disintegrated. They went into dust and nukes don't do that. Not at
[01:45:38.140 --> 01:45:43.340]  that level. They would radiation would have been extremely high. Well, I'll tell you, tower one
[01:45:43.340 --> 01:45:48.060]  and two are very suspicious but when you look at seven that's a conventional control demolition.
[01:45:48.060 --> 01:45:54.700]  No, it isn't. No, it was not either because you got to read the book where did the towers go by
[01:45:54.700 --> 01:46:01.420]  Dr. Judy Wood, the PSMS and PSU. No, I know who she is. I know who she is. I just finished her book.
[01:46:01.420 --> 01:46:07.180]  It's very remarkable. Well, I agree with you that tower one and two were exploded into pyrotechnic
[01:46:08.620 --> 01:46:14.700]  dust and things were being ejected long distances but seven you can see the boom boom boom boom
[01:46:14.700 --> 01:46:20.060]  boom and the and the symmetrical collapse into its own footprint. Yeah, but you also see it
[01:46:20.060 --> 01:46:27.020]  lathering up a half hour soon where smoke started coming out of one side of the building and one
[01:46:27.020 --> 01:46:35.740]  side of the building only. You had cases that dust was everywhere with paper. Always remember
[01:46:35.740 --> 01:46:44.700]  there's a simple thing. When metal is when when when something is hot it will grow but it doesn't
[01:46:44.700 --> 01:46:54.300]  have to go to be hot to grow but not everything that grows is hot. Well, I know this they do have
[01:46:54.300 --> 01:46:59.580]  a lot of weapon use that day Alex but it's a weapon that's beyond anything that I know about.
[01:46:59.580 --> 01:47:03.900]  Well, I'll tell you what I want to know. I want to know why they killed bin Laden if he knew how
[01:47:03.900 --> 01:47:08.780]  to make norad stand down. He knew how to have aircraft do maneuvers at the best fighter pilots
[01:47:08.780 --> 01:47:15.100]  couldn't do at flight 77 at the Pentagon. He supposedly has these. We should have captured
[01:47:15.100 --> 01:47:21.260]  the guy that should have been the highest priority but again I understand if it truly went down
[01:47:21.900 --> 01:47:27.260]  and the seals made the call on the ground I understand why because that's the same policy
[01:47:27.260 --> 01:47:32.380]  that we had for the last 40 years. Here's my issue. Bin Laden couldn't carry out 9-11.
[01:47:32.380 --> 01:47:36.060]  We know the hijackers were ordered to be led into the U.S. via the U.S. Embassy in
[01:47:36.620 --> 01:47:40.700]  Riyadh Saudi Arabia. We know the head of the defense language school went public and said
[01:47:40.700 --> 01:47:45.660]  Ada was trained there even you know Newsweek admits you know hijackers trained at U.S. bases.
[01:47:45.660 --> 01:47:51.500]  They were decoys they were set up and following the MO of these people the seals probably thought
[01:47:51.500 --> 01:47:55.740]  if they did do this mission that they were killing bin Laden and they had a lookalike in there who
[01:47:55.740 --> 01:48:00.380]  was playing part in some drill and then found out it was real and the seals shot them and they
[01:48:00.380 --> 01:48:04.540]  threw them in the ocean and told the seals good job you killed bin Laden. That's exactly how the
[01:48:04.540 --> 01:48:09.020]  globalists operate but again that is theory you know that that is going through a theory.
[01:48:09.020 --> 01:48:14.140]  All I know is that the official story of 9-11 doesn't fit into a guy in a cave being able
[01:48:14.140 --> 01:48:18.460]  to carry it out and regardless governor they've used 9-11. We got the Homeland Security Mic
[01:48:18.460 --> 01:48:23.500]  reports two years ago to go after the American people and to take our liberty so it's it's
[01:48:23.500 --> 01:48:29.180]  been used. I mean we know Saddam wasn't involved and they tried to frame him for it. Oh absolutely
[01:48:29.180 --> 01:48:36.940]  you know again America changed that fateful day and it changed for the worse and and I just have
[01:48:36.940 --> 01:48:43.020]  a difficult time believing this bearded guy in a cave is responsible for all this. I just have a
[01:48:43.020 --> 01:48:49.420]  very hard time accepting that as being the truth. You're right I absolutely agree with you and we
[01:48:49.420 --> 01:48:53.260]  need to continue to investigate it's certainly been used to kill our republic something foreign
[01:48:53.260 --> 01:48:58.140]  terrorists couldn't do. The government no matter what administration is in it energetically attacks
[01:48:58.140 --> 01:49:03.500]  Bill of Rights. By the way look at these they still don't admit that we did that show on my TV show Alex
[01:49:05.340 --> 01:49:10.780]  is the one on the police state that they pulled after one episode. That's right and the network
[01:49:10.780 --> 01:49:15.020]  won't say anything. Governor you told me privately that what you think the future of the show is.
[01:49:15.020 --> 01:49:19.420]  Are you ready to tell folks more about the show getting censored with that particular episode?
[01:49:19.420 --> 01:49:24.300]  Well I'll talk about that episode of course it was last year we did the episode on the police
[01:49:24.300 --> 01:49:29.820]  state where we should produce the Homeland Security bill that said FEMA was to build no less than
[01:49:29.820 --> 01:49:35.260]  six internment camps throughout the country and when I inquired as to who was going in these and
[01:49:35.260 --> 01:49:40.620]  why these were being built you know we got stiff opposition in Washington and of course they came
[01:49:40.620 --> 01:49:48.380]  down on the parent company of of uh of uh two TV and they pulled the show it only aired once and
[01:49:48.380 --> 01:49:53.340]  now they won't even acknowledge that the show exists and you fortunately you can see it because
[01:49:53.340 --> 01:49:58.300]  it aired that one time so it's going to be out there on YouTube but officially it's not part of
[01:49:58.300 --> 01:50:04.620]  the show anymore of the 15 episodes we did I guess there's only actually 14 now. What about the future
[01:50:04.620 --> 01:50:09.740]  of conspiracy theory which came out last season as the number one new show then they put it in the
[01:50:09.740 --> 01:50:15.180]  dead zone Friday night still the number one new show for second season uh you know record audience
[01:50:15.180 --> 01:50:20.380]  for those guys and uh now uh the you were telling me privately some things can you talk about that?
[01:50:20.380 --> 01:50:25.420]  Well just that you know the balls in their court whether it'll be renewed or not I can't say it
[01:50:25.420 --> 01:50:31.420]  this time I don't know if it will or will not be but uh they had to submit eight new conspiracy
[01:50:31.420 --> 01:50:36.780]  theories to them and uh so they will look them over and I guess make a determination of whether
[01:50:36.780 --> 01:50:41.660]  we're back on the air or not but they they haven't promoted us at all so that's not a good sign.
[01:50:42.700 --> 01:50:47.580]  Yeah um should folks try to contact True TV or Time Warner and tell them put that good
[01:50:47.580 --> 01:50:55.020]  informative. I I don't do that Alex if people want to do that that's up to them but you know
[01:50:55.020 --> 01:51:01.260]  I I won't ask for people to do that at all I uh you know if the if the if people are inclined to
[01:51:01.260 --> 01:51:06.460]  want to do that they certainly you know I encourage them that they certainly can but I won't ask for
[01:51:06.460 --> 01:51:11.980]  that at all. Well I'll say this I mean I know you told me on the road well I'm going to get into it
[01:51:11.980 --> 01:51:15.980]  yeah it's not a lot of sweat off your back if they don't want to renew it it's a lot of work
[01:51:15.980 --> 01:51:21.580]  I mean you guys fly all over the country a lot of research and that that's another problem we have
[01:51:21.580 --> 01:51:27.020]  Alex what do I do about my flying situation now well because I cannot fly commercial anymore.
[01:51:27.020 --> 01:51:31.340]  That's right they don't want to pay for the private jet I know that's probably part of it so
[01:51:31.340 --> 01:51:36.380]  there is Homeland Security ruining your TV show. Yeah very well could be because of the
[01:51:36.380 --> 01:51:41.900]  fact that I you know I have the pending lawsuit therefore I cannot fly commercially so I can't
[01:51:41.900 --> 01:51:47.020]  go out on location anymore unless they fly me in a private jet and they certainly don't have the
[01:51:47.020 --> 01:51:52.300]  budget for that I can assure you of that. Well just like the Jews in Nazi Germany first they
[01:51:52.300 --> 01:51:57.580]  wouldn't let them travel wouldn't let them do business now Homeland Security headed up by Schumer
[01:51:57.580 --> 01:52:03.260]  and others are saying that you will be on a no-work list no travel list starting with trains
[01:52:03.260 --> 01:52:08.460]  aircraft no gun by list White House is pushing that just a magic list that they just put you on
[01:52:08.460 --> 01:52:14.780]  and they admit in the Washington Post anti-war people pro-gun property rights people tea party
[01:52:14.780 --> 01:52:19.980]  people are now being barred over two million on the list the government just puts you on a list
[01:52:19.980 --> 01:52:25.740]  and now soon it'll be Alex how do you find out if you're on the list I think you just they won't
[01:52:25.740 --> 01:52:31.100]  tell you why you're on it you just suddenly can't travel I mean that's Nazi Germany right there
[01:52:31.740 --> 01:52:37.340]  that's ridiculous I mean why can't you go and inquire whether you're on the list or not I mean
[01:52:37.340 --> 01:52:41.420]  it seems to me you should be able to do that well what do you think of them well you might be a
[01:52:41.420 --> 01:52:44.940]  terrorist governor and what do you think about everybody's a terrorist but the government crooks
[01:52:44.940 --> 01:52:49.820]  robbing us it's now been confirmed 27 trillion as we broke down two years ago or a year and a half
[01:52:49.820 --> 01:52:55.820]  ago 27 trillion just up until about a year and a half into the bailout that the rest is secret
[01:52:55.820 --> 01:53:02.380]  27 trillion to foreign banks and people like MSNBC got federal reserve taxpayer money to push
[01:53:02.380 --> 01:53:08.460]  propaganda and now we learn what's going on but let's not worry about the bankers robbing us
[01:53:08.460 --> 01:53:13.580]  and the dollar plunging let's all worry about terrorists under the table governor oh not only
[01:53:13.580 --> 01:53:18.140]  terrorists under the table but like these three gentlemen I ran into at the golf course the other
[01:53:18.140 --> 01:53:25.340]  day they were more worried about that we got to stop these unions you know these union benefits
[01:53:25.340 --> 01:53:30.860]  that these state workers have we got to get rid of that I looked at these guys and said oh you
[01:53:30.860 --> 01:53:38.060]  want to bust them but you don't want to do nothing about wall street huh oh man well I mean look look
[01:53:38.060 --> 01:53:45.660]  look they always talk about free market wall street is the main piglet on the teat of the hog
[01:53:45.660 --> 01:53:50.860]  and it's a piglet four or five times bigger than the mama hog and the rest of the population is
[01:53:50.860 --> 01:53:56.300]  starving runt piglets with our bones showing and wall street sitting there bigger than mama
[01:53:56.300 --> 01:54:01.420]  sucking everything out of the in mama basically it's a vampire pig sucking the blood out of mama
[01:54:02.060 --> 01:54:10.380]  I got a good idea too Alex let's stop benefits for elected officials yes let's truly make it public
[01:54:10.380 --> 01:54:17.420]  service but if you go there to get elected you do public service you don't get your own retirement
[01:54:17.420 --> 01:54:23.900]  fund you don't get your own medical health care but you have to have the same health care than any
[01:54:23.900 --> 01:54:28.780]  other government employee has that's a good point they make themselves exempt from the rules we're
[01:54:28.780 --> 01:54:33.100]  under and the system that they create for us just like you pointed out government can lie all day
[01:54:33.100 --> 01:54:38.460]  and never gets in trouble but if they claim we lie we go to the gulag yeah we go to jail for it no
[01:54:38.460 --> 01:54:43.820]  absolutely we should cut out all benefits for them make them survive the same way we have to
[01:54:44.620 --> 01:54:49.900]  you know like right now you know they're going to revamp social security and all that wasn't
[01:54:49.900 --> 01:54:54.940]  interesting they don't get social security very well said governor almost out of time
[01:54:54.940 --> 01:54:59.980]  we have a deal at info wars dot com that when you get jessie ventura's 63 documents government
[01:54:59.980 --> 01:55:05.900]  doesn't want you to read incredible hardcover wake up anybody out there it's only proven admitted
[01:55:05.900 --> 01:55:11.340]  crimes and outrageous terrorist events and government drug dealing it's an amazing book
[01:55:11.340 --> 01:55:15.900]  and you get big brother they're a welly and nightmare come true discounted with it by mark
[01:55:15.900 --> 01:55:22.620]  dies you can get any of my new films or films i produced whatever film you choose dvd film free
[01:55:22.620 --> 01:55:27.500]  when you get it with governor ventura's book along with big brother or get either one of these books
[01:55:27.500 --> 01:55:36.140]  by themselves all available at info wars dot com or by calling toll free 8882533139 the good news is
[01:55:36.140 --> 01:55:43.820]  governor my radio show and websites are exponentially growing your book is way up there on the best
[01:55:43.820 --> 01:55:48.620]  seller list a week after week you know what's interesting about it though alex this is my
[01:55:48.620 --> 01:55:53.500]  second book way up on the best seller list and again it hasn't been reviewed by any mainstream
[01:55:53.500 --> 01:56:01.020]  media to my knowledge absolutely the fix is in yeah no i mean they don't review my books at all
[01:56:01.020 --> 01:56:06.220]  they ignore them completely they completely ignore them no matter how long they stay on the new
[01:56:06.220 --> 01:56:10.780]  york times top 10 but here's the difference in the past if they did that with a book it would never
[01:56:10.780 --> 01:56:16.380]  even make it on the charts now the alternative media the real media is growing so fast they're
[01:56:16.380 --> 01:56:21.420]  panicking but here's the problem this is an internet kill switch that homeland security setup
[01:56:21.420 --> 01:56:26.060]  it's really an internet takeover system and the government's admitting now they may start shutting
[01:56:26.060 --> 01:56:30.700]  down alternative media and that they're going to start broadcasting government announcements
[01:56:30.700 --> 01:56:36.620]  over all media breaking in i mean doesn't that sound like the running man yeah it sounds like

[02:00:28.460 --> 02:00:35.340]  author researcher libertarian presidential candidate bob bar dot org liberty guard dot org
[02:00:35.340 --> 02:00:40.140]  he's been on the front lines exposing the expansion of the war on terror the attack on our liberties
[02:00:40.140 --> 02:00:46.860]  and the tsa and all the horrible activities they're engaged in now congressman i'm even
[02:00:46.860 --> 02:00:53.260]  seeing mainstream media say this is a federal unsworn police force doing things fbi can't even do
[02:00:53.260 --> 02:00:57.900]  they have no statutory authority to stick the hands on the outside and touch the generals or
[02:00:57.900 --> 02:01:04.380]  inside as you know now a federal judge has said it's that you have a right to have tsa they upside
[02:01:04.380 --> 02:01:10.780]  down put their hands down your pants uh at the um at the school proms in in in santa fe they're
[02:01:10.780 --> 02:01:16.540]  announcing a rollout on the highway streets roads the infrastructure is being seized uh what's your
[02:01:16.540 --> 02:01:23.180]  overall view of where this is going it's outrageous and if americans don't uh do what uh where you and
[02:01:23.180 --> 02:01:29.260]  many of your listeners have been doing by setting the example and that is to uh stand up and say
[02:01:29.260 --> 02:01:35.180]  not just nobody he'll know then uh you know the the limitations on government and the protections
[02:01:35.180 --> 02:01:40.300]  for our privacy and our persons that are embodied in the fourth amendment will be essentially
[02:01:40.300 --> 02:01:47.740]  meaningless uh it's just absolutely outrageous uh uh not only what government and tsa in particular
[02:01:47.740 --> 02:01:54.940]  are doing but what is most distressing is the number of americans that sit back like damn sheep
[02:01:54.940 --> 02:02:01.180]  and accept this nonsense well said my friend no you're absolutely right well it's time to get
[02:02:01.180 --> 02:02:10.540]  angry uh the the texas legislator voted in the house 138 to zero unanimous to enforce the law
[02:02:10.540 --> 02:02:17.020]  and not let them uh grope women and children or men for that matter and then the republican
[02:02:17.020 --> 02:02:21.740]  leader of the senate the lieutenant governor david dohurst uh and then there are state senators
[02:02:21.740 --> 02:02:27.500]  on record in the dallas morning news you name it uh that that he said don't let anybody know i'm
[02:02:27.500 --> 02:02:32.940]  doing this but with the justice department he threatened and lobbied and and the justice
[02:02:32.940 --> 02:02:38.780]  department put a letter out publicly congressman saying they would blockade and have a no fly zone
[02:02:38.780 --> 02:02:45.020]  over texas uh if they did not uh uh back off of this bill what's your take on that
[02:02:45.020 --> 02:02:52.140]  well i used to i used to think that uh you know that the the slogan don't mess with texas actually
[02:02:52.140 --> 02:02:58.460]  meant something but i'm beginning to wonder now uh you know they uh that they back down
[02:02:59.100 --> 02:03:05.020]  on this at least uh the senate apparently did i mean it's ridiculous to let the government
[02:03:05.020 --> 02:03:10.940]  bully a state like this a knife no fly zone that people can't fly in and out of texas give me a
[02:03:10.940 --> 02:03:16.940]  break i mean how in heaven's name would they enforce something like that obviously they couldn't
[02:03:16.940 --> 02:03:22.220]  uh and if they tried uh then texas would stand up to it they would uh they would have security at
[02:03:22.220 --> 02:03:27.100]  the the airports uh that was uh that would be probably perhaps certainly as good as if not
[02:03:27.100 --> 02:03:35.740]  probably better than what tsa provides well what does that say about the mindset of the
[02:03:35.740 --> 02:03:41.340]  just department and and janet napolitano at homeland security that they would have a us attorney
[02:03:41.340 --> 02:03:48.060]  send a letter just arrogantly saying we'll shut down your air traffic i mean this is this sounds
[02:03:48.060 --> 02:03:54.460]  like how the civil war started it it doesn't surprise me and i doubt that it it really surprises
[02:03:54.460 --> 02:03:59.660]  you alex or your listeners i mean we've seen this uh federal bullying by republicans and
[02:03:59.660 --> 02:04:06.460]  democrats alike for many many years now and i was hopeful uh you know until until yesterday i guess
[02:04:06.460 --> 02:04:13.580]  it was uh that texas would finally stand up to this to this nonsense uh but now you know obviously uh
[02:04:13.580 --> 02:04:19.020]  yeah they've at least backed out for the moment unfortunately uh hopefully uh perhaps congress
[02:04:19.020 --> 02:04:23.820]  i mean how is how is the lone star states uh congressional delegation handling this are they
[02:04:23.820 --> 02:04:30.780]  going to fight for the freedom uh and the fourth amendment uh for leis texas well that's the word

[02:08:21.820 --> 02:08:28.860]  bob bar dot com liberty good guard dot org he was the presidential nominee in 2000 for libertarian
[02:08:28.860 --> 02:08:35.980]  party senior member of the house of representatives bob bar is our guest for this one segment to
[02:08:35.980 --> 02:08:42.540]  look at the whole tsa situation congressman why have you weighed in and started an organization
[02:08:42.540 --> 02:08:49.500]  and for your request uh dealing with the stand down of thanksgiving and the reported secret
[02:08:49.500 --> 02:08:58.380]  political persecution list the tsa why for you is the tsa such an important issue it's such an
[02:08:58.380 --> 02:09:05.260]  important issue alex because it embodies uh what is happening to our fourth amendment protection
[02:09:05.260 --> 02:09:11.580]  which is the fourth amendment being the the the essential privacy protection that we as citizens
[02:09:11.580 --> 02:09:20.060]  in a free society have or should have uh against uh unreasonable government intrusion uh if there
[02:09:20.060 --> 02:09:25.020]  is a better example other than the some of the nonsense with the patriot act which we can talk
[02:09:25.020 --> 02:09:30.540]  about on a different day which is very important uh a better example of how the government that
[02:09:30.540 --> 02:09:37.660]  does not give a darn about the fourth amendment than what tsa is doing that i'd like to hear
[02:09:37.660 --> 02:09:45.100]  it uh when a person and i've had this happen to me uh goes through uh to board a plane first of all
[02:09:45.100 --> 02:09:50.940]  i don't think they they have any right uh or reason to you know look at my id that has nothing to do
[02:09:50.940 --> 02:09:56.380]  with with uh whether or not i have weapons or explosives but be that as it may once a person
[02:09:56.380 --> 02:10:02.860]  goes through the metal or explosive detectors unless there is some other reason articulable reason
[02:10:02.860 --> 02:10:09.500]  the tsa has to suspect that person uh opposing a danger they have no right whatsoever to search
[02:10:09.500 --> 02:10:17.180]  that person further and to say well simply because you don't want to have a a new body scan taken
[02:10:17.180 --> 02:10:24.140]  of you uh you're going to have a groping which used to be reserved for uh for suspected criminals
[02:10:24.140 --> 02:10:31.020]  upon arrest or detention uh that uh that provide the reasonable suspicion is absolute nonsense
[02:10:31.020 --> 02:10:37.180]  so the point is uh if we don't stop the government here uh based on violation of fourth amendment
[02:10:37.180 --> 02:10:41.980]  then there really is not going to be very much at all in the future that we'll be able to stop
[02:10:41.980 --> 02:10:50.060]  the government from doing that's why this battle is so important also a new video is out of a
[02:10:50.060 --> 02:10:57.660]  congressman on c-span uh congressman on a recent flight said tsa patted down child little old lady
[02:10:57.660 --> 02:11:04.460]  but ignored a man in arab garb and uh that of course uh the hill newspaper is also reporting
[02:11:04.460 --> 02:11:11.740]  that paul brown republican of uh george is saying uh your state well i have to confirm i i fly quite
[02:11:11.740 --> 02:11:23.500]  a bit and in places like san aroza san jose other areas uh new jersey all i see is women and children
[02:11:23.500 --> 02:11:29.260]  i do not see them uh if somebody's in a wheelchair and can hardly walk they go after them like wolves
[02:11:29.260 --> 02:11:36.460]  if if it's a baby they they they check in the diaper i've seen it if it's a young woman and
[02:11:36.460 --> 02:11:41.420]  but if you've got if you're wearing uh arab dress in a turban and i'm not seeing i'm not attacking
[02:11:41.420 --> 02:11:48.140]  those people in saying they should be singled out either it's they're left alone uh so this really
[02:11:48.140 --> 02:11:55.180]  just appears to be conditioning for the american people to have these federal goons the fb i can't
[02:11:55.180 --> 02:12:00.700]  stick their hands down your pants without a warrant uh how how then can they do this
[02:12:01.820 --> 02:12:07.420]  now they they they do it because we let them do it uh because americans by the millions say oh it
[02:12:07.420 --> 02:12:13.740]  makes us safer or oh i have nothing to hide uh and therefore they uh like like cheap they they let
[02:12:13.740 --> 02:12:17.900]  the government do this uh the only way this is going to be stopped i don't think it's going to
[02:12:17.900 --> 02:12:22.620]  happen through the courts unfortunately uh but we have to fight these battles through the courts
[02:12:22.620 --> 02:12:28.940]  also the only way we're going to have any hope is if people rise up against this uh and go to
[02:12:28.940 --> 02:12:35.500]  their members of congress go to their state legislatures uh go to their senators and demand
[02:12:35.500 --> 02:12:45.420]  that tsa be reigned in and that the fourth amendment actually be uh given uh the uh the the the the
[02:12:45.420 --> 02:12:53.340]  power to protect individuals that it used to have sir looking at the tsa announcements that they want
[02:12:53.340 --> 02:12:59.740]  to be in high school proms if you're a new listener that's not a joke uh in santa fe a federal judge
[02:12:59.740 --> 02:13:04.780]  ruling that well we'll send them there to grow up kids to to make sure their rights aren't violated
[02:13:04.780 --> 02:13:12.140]  it's just a bizarre orwellian statement or tsa now actually in florida texas massachusetts new york
[02:13:12.140 --> 02:13:19.260]  california are now setting up checkpoints on highways not just bus terminals and doing the
[02:13:19.260 --> 02:13:25.100]  groping and and and the hands and the pants i mean i this is so off the charts i can't even
[02:13:25.100 --> 02:13:31.100]  believe this is really happening i mean this is this is the soviet union didn't do this it's uh
[02:13:31.100 --> 02:13:36.220]  it's unprecedented uh and again if we don't put a stop to a pretty darn quick the fourth amendment
[02:13:36.220 --> 02:13:43.420]  will have lost any meaning uh whatsoever the same thing is happening even here in in in georgia tsa
[02:13:43.420 --> 02:13:48.540]  and department of homeland security are setting up uh i forget what the the acronym stands for the
[02:13:48.540 --> 02:13:56.940]  viper program vi pr where they will set up uh roadblocks uh on uh major highways uh sometimes
[02:13:56.940 --> 02:14:03.580]  during rush hour uh they will set up uh set up folks at train stations you might have seen a couple
[02:14:03.580 --> 02:14:10.380]  months ago this happened at the train station in savannah georgia and they will uh start conducting
[02:14:10.380 --> 02:14:17.420]  random searches of people uh stopping trucks at uh at truck stops uh and you know supposedly
[02:14:17.420 --> 02:14:22.780]  looking for terrorists i mean utterly arbitrary utterly nonsensical but as you said a moment
[02:14:22.780 --> 02:14:28.620]  ago in your absolutely correct this is conditioning americans to having government be able to do
[02:14:28.620 --> 02:14:34.460]  anything it wants them it's not about security alex it's about control well here's an example of that
[02:14:34.460 --> 02:14:39.340]  i have been going down to bolivar since i was a child and i hadn't been in more than a decade so
[02:14:39.340 --> 02:14:44.540]  i took my children there and then the the ferry from galveston to bolivar there's a road you can
[02:14:44.540 --> 02:14:48.220]  drive around a few miles out of the way but i thought let's take a little ferry takes about
[02:14:48.220 --> 02:14:54.300]  five minutes to go across and when i pulled up they had all the families out and they search
[02:14:54.300 --> 02:14:59.260]  every car now and dig through your belongings before you get on the ferry and and then they
[02:14:59.260 --> 02:15:05.500]  said well you don't like this uh we set up highway checkpoints now and it it's it's so
[02:15:05.500 --> 02:15:10.140]  asinine and and then with dominique strouse con they have a new bill in new york state
[02:15:10.140 --> 02:15:16.620]  that all of the hotel maids must wear emergency necklaces because one guy might have tried to
[02:15:16.620 --> 02:15:21.420]  grope somebody so the idea is the government will keep you safe from everything well the
[02:15:21.420 --> 02:15:26.220]  government can't keep you safe from everything and every time government claims it's going to do that
[02:15:26.220 --> 02:15:31.740]  historically congressmen aren't they a government tyranny always the greatest threat to life liberty
[02:15:32.540 --> 02:15:37.260]  it certainly is because they have a monopoly on legitimate power in terms that they define what
[02:15:37.260 --> 02:15:44.460]  the citizens can or cannot do uh it's the typical government reaction uh whether it's about guns
[02:15:44.460 --> 02:15:49.740]  whether it's about prescription drugs for example we just had a bill in georgia that was
[02:15:49.740 --> 02:15:57.340]  passed and signed by republicans of course uh that now sets up a uh a database of prescription
[02:15:57.340 --> 02:16:03.500]  drugs uh the reason for this is well there are these folks out there that abuse prescriptions
[02:16:03.500 --> 02:16:08.700]  therefore in order to make law enforcement's job easier to catch these few scoff laws we're going
[02:16:08.700 --> 02:16:13.580]  to inconvenience and invade the privacy of everybody that gets a prescription filled
[02:16:13.580 --> 02:16:18.380]  and people just sit back and say oh it makes us safer well it must be okay then
[02:16:18.380 --> 02:16:24.780]  and now with political hit list we know medical records have been used by presidents and people
[02:16:24.780 --> 02:16:30.620]  now if any of these cops without a warrant want to know exactly what i'm taking exactly what my
[02:16:30.620 --> 02:16:36.700]  wife's taking exactly what my children have taken this is one of the most sacrosanct privacy areas
[02:16:36.700 --> 02:16:44.700]  there are and it's uh i don't know how it is in texas but uh in georgia and down in florida
[02:16:44.700 --> 02:16:51.340]  it's a republicans i tell you alex without exaggeration georgia is a perfect example
[02:16:51.340 --> 02:16:57.020]  when the republicans get into power and control both branches both the executive and the legislative
[02:16:57.020 --> 02:17:04.380]  branches of state government uh they impose more controls and invade more of our liberties
[02:17:04.380 --> 02:17:10.300]  than the democrats did and that's what was so wonderful about the texas situation the
[02:17:10.300 --> 02:17:17.260]  unanimous 138 vote in the house to criminalize what's already criminal with the tsa but start
[02:17:17.260 --> 02:17:22.620]  prosecuting these these molesters to have republicans and democrats come together for the bill of
[02:17:22.620 --> 02:17:29.900]  rights and constitution and then have the republican david dohurst a bush carl rove protege kill it in
[02:17:29.900 --> 02:17:36.220]  secret and senators have gone public that he said keep this secret i'm doing this uh what's your view
[02:17:36.220 --> 02:17:43.740]  of uh something like that it's uh highly unethical uh certainly uh it ought to outrage the citizenry
[02:17:43.740 --> 02:17:48.220]  ought to outrage the governor i mean what does that governor perry intend to do about this
[02:17:49.500 --> 02:17:56.460]  well senator dan patrick uh the next senior republican senator under dohurst uh is the
[02:17:56.460 --> 02:18:01.420]  one blowing the whistle and others are now in the papers saying oh yeah uh dohurst had
[02:18:01.420 --> 02:18:05.980]  federal obvious with him and was threatening everyone and saying they couldn't pass it while
[02:18:05.980 --> 02:18:12.140]  publicly saying he supported it i mean if that isn't a new level of political treachery i don't
[02:18:12.140 --> 02:18:18.220]  know what is well it's pretty treachery and pretty political cowardice as well uh and i'm uh you know
[02:18:18.220 --> 02:18:23.500]  delighted uh that you're standing uh firm on this and uh and bringing light to this and hopefully
[02:18:23.500 --> 02:18:28.220]  many many of your other colleagues in the media will be doing the same and i hope uh i hope perry
[02:18:28.220 --> 02:18:33.180]  does i hope he doesn't just cave into this now we've only got a minute left i i ran out of time
[02:18:33.980 --> 02:18:37.820]  your four-year request you told me privately you're getting ready to sue if they don't answer
[02:18:37.820 --> 02:18:42.780]  your four years speak to that briefly and then also homeland security saying they won't show
[02:18:42.780 --> 02:18:49.260]  the statute where they have the authority to stick hands down pants uh the tsa is an agency
[02:18:49.260 --> 02:18:53.660]  with the support of his parent agency department of homeland security that believes it's above the
[02:18:53.660 --> 02:18:59.500]  law very honestly and congress needs to step in and rein it in in the absence of that what we're
[02:18:59.500 --> 02:19:06.940]  doing at liberty guard at www dot liberty guard dot org is uh going through the the freedom of
[02:19:06.940 --> 02:19:12.940]  information act which uh tsa is fighting uh and it looks like uh we're you know we're just trying
[02:19:12.940 --> 02:19:18.140]  to get some basic information on on how all of this uh these scanners and the groping is being
[02:19:18.140 --> 02:19:22.700]  conducted and so forth and then what authority they're refusing to divulge and it looks like
[02:19:22.700 --> 02:19:27.260]  we'll have to go through the uh the court system and you know as we'll leave people's support for
[02:19:27.260 --> 02:19:32.780]  that absolutely and and and now we learn congress one of the radiation readings and then they gave
[02:19:32.780 --> 02:19:40.060]  them fake ones i mean the these guys think they're god oh they they do i i i used to think that
[02:19:40.060 --> 02:19:45.020]  being a lawyer that the most powerful people on the face of the earth were uh were federal judges
[02:19:45.020 --> 02:19:51.500]  once they get the robe and uh but uh they're uh they're kids uh compared to uh these folks at

[02:24:15.740 --> 02:24:21.020]  of issues here before i get into all the other financial and geopolitical and obama now quoted
[02:24:21.020 --> 02:24:27.900]  again saying he's got a stealth plan to get our guns i want to spend some time on this tsa
[02:24:27.900 --> 02:24:33.180]  situation because this affects not just the us with the entire planet not just texas but every
[02:24:33.180 --> 02:24:40.460]  state in this union it is now confirmed what we told you nine years ago because then it was public
[02:24:40.460 --> 02:24:45.980]  as well just not widely circulated that the tsa is the domestic national security force
[02:24:45.980 --> 02:24:52.060]  and you notice it's bipartisan bush obama across the board they want to make this a republican
[02:24:52.060 --> 02:24:57.180]  democrat issue so when obama's in democrats will support the tsa and then when republicans are in
[02:24:57.180 --> 02:25:01.340]  they'll support it that's how they divide us in the left right paradigm i don't care if you're a
[02:25:01.340 --> 02:25:07.340]  liberal conservative libertarian communist aster bunny whatever it is you shouldn't want this to
[02:25:07.340 --> 02:25:15.900]  be done to you and your family i mean the soviet union at its height didn't uh uh you know take miss
[02:25:15.900 --> 02:25:20.300]  soviet union or whatever at a checkpoint stick their hands down her pants they would know one
[02:25:20.300 --> 02:25:25.420]  would ever not in communist china i talked folks that fly there all the time even touch your body
[02:25:26.300 --> 02:25:29.260]  if they're suspicious or think you're doing something they call you in behind closed doors
[02:25:29.260 --> 02:25:35.340]  and interrogate you but but again political correctness they're not making a mistake hearing
[02:25:35.340 --> 02:25:39.180]  oh we don't want to target certain groups so everyone has hands down their pants
[02:25:40.700 --> 02:25:45.500]  it's designed that way so they flip it around and say all of you are guilty
[02:25:47.980 --> 02:25:51.260]  but but i'm digressing here's the points i want to get into
[02:25:54.540 --> 02:26:00.140]  a great job to the hundreds of people that showed up during the afternoon and throughout
[02:26:00.140 --> 02:26:09.340]  the evening when they closed the uh day session at past 11 o'clock at night uh folks were in the gallery
[02:26:11.180 --> 02:26:18.060]  and uh you said traders trees and and do hearse made sarcastic remarks to the media
[02:26:19.420 --> 02:26:23.580]  saying i guess they don't like all we've done for them and and and then laughed about patrick
[02:26:23.580 --> 02:26:30.780]  and made some sarcastic comments about senator patrick uh who's who's now exposed uh do hearst i
[02:26:30.780 --> 02:26:34.540]  want to talk about the state police i had a dutch film crew with me and they couldn't believe
[02:26:35.180 --> 02:26:43.900]  citizens marching into a capital and screaming at the lobbyist screaming at the senators going
[02:26:43.900 --> 02:26:48.460]  to their offices and screaming at them well that's what freedom looks like if you don't have that
[02:26:48.460 --> 02:26:54.620]  you've got the opposite what this country's now turned into that's your birthright and if you don't
[02:26:54.620 --> 02:27:01.660]  like seeing people behave like that and do things like that and this quote civil society
[02:27:02.220 --> 02:27:10.700]  when you have an a a a outrageous federal power grab meant to break our will meant to
[02:27:11.740 --> 02:27:18.220]  set a precedent where they can do anything they want extreme tyranny calls for extreme actions
[02:27:18.220 --> 02:27:23.900]  and this was not extreme actions going down there and showing them that we're angry and uh
[02:27:24.620 --> 02:27:31.740]  getting in their face and then garnering literally hundreds of tv stations there were
[02:27:31.740 --> 02:27:36.940]  hundreds of tv stations there in the final days of the texas legislature and at any one time
[02:27:36.940 --> 02:27:41.900]  i had 20 news cameras around me and then my job was done in an hour hour and 20 minutes i left
[02:27:41.900 --> 02:27:46.220]  and i said okay all you great patrons that came out you go be on the media now they were all over

[02:28:11.260 --> 02:28:19.740]  blow against the globalist oh they unanimously passed it in the house 138 to zero they had 30
[02:28:19.740 --> 02:28:26.460]  of 31 senators almost unanimous and do hers killed it and we now know how do hers killed it and and
[02:28:27.900 --> 02:28:35.180]  we won this battle oh we didn't lose by them engaging in this treachery uh many texas papers
[02:28:35.180 --> 02:28:41.180]  across the board both democrat and republican editorial boards are saying do hers is done
[02:28:41.900 --> 02:28:48.140]  do hers it's over you know why he didn't proudly get up and say i work for the justice department
[02:28:48.700 --> 02:28:53.660]  and i and i want to be a u.s senator and i'm a toady and i've and i've worked with obama's people
[02:28:53.660 --> 02:28:57.580]  he lets senators know and they're on record saying don't let anybody know i can't have
[02:28:57.580 --> 02:29:02.940]  fingerprints on this we're gonna kill it and he worked the floor and made threats and made promises
[02:29:02.940 --> 02:29:11.980]  to kill it and uh knocked the 30 of 31 votes down to almost zero with some of these cowards and the
[02:29:11.980 --> 02:29:19.740]  fact that his treachery has been shown and the fact that uh finally senator patrick hitting

[02:33:31.260 --> 02:33:36.060]  not let tsa stick their hands on the outside and inside of men women and children's pants
[02:33:36.620 --> 02:33:41.820]  and grab their genitals and when he left us i talked during the break he said yeah we still

[02:33:48.940 --> 02:33:53.740]  bill uh to be able to get through there may be a day or two left but uh a lot's happening the
[02:33:53.740 --> 02:33:58.700]  point is we need to get down there today we need to go to the capital texas capital did you know
[02:33:58.700 --> 02:34:03.580]  this it's normally you go and you talk to your state senators not the house members they unanimously
[02:34:03.580 --> 02:34:07.660]  voted uh to do the right thing you can pat them on the back if you want but what needs to be done
[02:34:07.660 --> 02:34:11.980]  first is there's only 31 of these senators and you need to go to every one of their offices
[02:34:13.100 --> 02:34:17.820]  and uh you can also go in in the gallery and you know watch the whole thing in session
[02:34:18.540 --> 02:34:25.100]  and uh let these folks know that uh in their offices that you do not like uh what's happening
[02:34:25.100 --> 02:34:33.900]  so uh that's what we're dealing with right now and i've already got rob jacobson down there
[02:34:34.780 --> 02:34:40.540]  he sees a few people obviously i just called for this an hour ago uh i'm going to leave here
[02:34:40.540 --> 02:34:46.940]  at about 210 central and i'll be down there in part by 230 240 or so the point is this i'll be in
[02:34:46.940 --> 02:34:51.340]  there you'll see me but the point is it's for you as a citizen to go talk it's not even a
[02:34:51.340 --> 02:34:55.900]  demonstration or a rally later if folks want to congregate you know in the south lawn or something
[02:34:55.900 --> 02:35:00.380]  media needs to be there uh i guess we could do that at four o'clock or something the point is
[02:35:01.100 --> 02:35:04.940]  i've even got other stuff i got to do on top of this we need to go down there talk to our senators
[02:35:04.940 --> 02:35:08.780]  because they're just ignoring the phone calls because they're getting so many phone calls
[02:35:08.780 --> 02:35:13.420]  right now and say look it's illegal what the tsa is doing they don't have a lot of back it up the
[02:35:13.420 --> 02:35:19.740]  state rep talked about that earlier they're just brazenly doing it we need to get down there we
[02:35:19.740 --> 02:35:25.180]  need to go i'm asking you to go i don't do a lot of demonstrations or events i've done it i've been
[02:35:25.180 --> 02:35:32.300]  on international television national tv nightline uh you name it i've i've spoken to rallies at 10
[02:35:32.300 --> 02:35:38.300]  thousand people 2000 people a thousand just i don't just go around doing these events because i
[02:35:38.300 --> 02:35:43.580]  realized that it's about talking to the senators it's about informing people electronically
[02:35:43.580 --> 02:35:48.540]  through the media but it but but showing yourself on events like this this is what it's all about
[02:35:48.540 --> 02:35:56.940]  it's about the people showing that you'll feel by their physical presence that they are uh against
[02:35:56.940 --> 02:36:04.300]  what's happening now joining us from triply libya under months and months of bombardment
[02:36:04.300 --> 02:36:10.140]  british attack helicopters now being dispatched uh u.s and british forces advising admitted
[02:36:10.140 --> 02:36:15.340]  taliban and al-qaeda and the fight against muammar qaddafi the attempted assassinations
[02:36:15.340 --> 02:36:19.020]  are ongoing and they're not even calling them assassinations even though they're admitted
[02:36:19.020 --> 02:36:23.580]  uh the russians are now calling for an immediate ceasefire and libya saying this is an attack a
[02:36:23.580 --> 02:36:29.180]  humanitarian disaster uh they now admit the arrest of the arab springs are being funded by the cia
[02:36:29.180 --> 02:36:35.100]  that's now admitted um google and others in europe have just been praised for it uh former congress
[02:36:35.100 --> 02:36:40.300]  woman syntia mckinney has been demonized because she has a lot of courage she spoke up against dine
[02:36:40.300 --> 02:36:45.820]  corn hella burt and child kidnapping rings and got rumsfeld to admit it she fought against force
[02:36:45.820 --> 02:36:51.740]  inoculations she she fought against the patriot act she has a lot of courage and she's member of the
[02:36:51.740 --> 02:36:58.860]  green party um she's been awarded the peace through conscience award from the munich american peace
[02:36:58.860 --> 02:37:05.820]  committee uh and yesterday she appeared on state run libyan tv and that's caused quite a hubbub here
[02:37:05.820 --> 02:37:10.540]  domestically uh because she has the courage to go to that we were talking yesterday on the phone
[02:37:10.540 --> 02:37:16.700]  with bombs going off the background uh congress woman uh we appreciate you joining us alex it's
[02:37:16.700 --> 02:37:26.220]  been too long i have wanted to come on your show for so long but um it's quite um you know whatever
[02:37:26.220 --> 02:37:33.660]  we get together it's wonderful so thank you so much for having me on and um you know it's dark here
[02:37:33.660 --> 02:37:44.700]  now and uh after the meeting of uh president and cameron we expect that uh there will be intense
[02:37:44.700 --> 02:37:51.980]  bombing tonight we don't know that but we expect that that's what is in store for us more humanitarian
[02:37:51.980 --> 02:37:59.580]  intervention from nato and obama told cameron no let up on qaddafi uh now uh have you talked to qaddafi
[02:37:59.580 --> 02:38:04.220]  what have you witnessed what are you seeing we're seeing the images of civilian dead burning
[02:38:04.220 --> 02:38:09.900]  buildings and our media tells us 1984 style this is not an assault this is not an attack
[02:38:09.900 --> 02:38:15.740]  this is humanitarian they're sinking with eight ships last week in the harbor uh bombs going off
[02:38:15.740 --> 02:38:22.780]  everywhere more bombs yesterday what are you witnessing um they're lying the american people
[02:38:22.780 --> 02:38:33.500]  are being lied to um not only by the media by their leaders um and this is becoming a humanitarian
[02:38:33.500 --> 02:38:43.100]  disaster for example i have a an italian woman here who did everything she could to purchase
[02:38:43.100 --> 02:38:51.500]  medicines because they want to purchase medicines and um the government of idly put a stop on the
[02:38:51.500 --> 02:38:58.220]  uh purchase by the libyans of medicines for their people and that's a violation of the
[02:38:58.220 --> 02:39:03.900]  geneva convention that is a serious war crime that's right and and then we have the situation
[02:39:03.900 --> 02:39:14.940]  with the uh fuel for uh the civilian youth um that they have uh effectively blockaded the harbor
[02:39:14.940 --> 02:39:25.900]  so that deliveries of benzene to uh fuel the cars um is um uh not permitted and this is
[02:39:25.900 --> 02:39:33.580]  affecting the civilian population so you will see what looks like a traffic jam and actually
[02:39:33.580 --> 02:39:40.380]  its cars lined up hundreds of cars lined up at the service station
[02:39:40.380 --> 02:39:50.060]  so they're have libya under siege uh tell us what it's like on the ground tell us tell us
[02:39:50.060 --> 02:39:53.820]  what you're witnessing tell us what you said on uh libyan television
[02:39:54.860 --> 02:40:03.900]  well basically um now here's the interesting thing because um these people uh the the the
[02:40:03.900 --> 02:40:13.900]  libyans are undeterred they seem to be unafraid i was with a group of women i wrote in the piece
[02:40:13.900 --> 02:40:22.860]  that that i did a feast of blood um about a woman whose mother is in bengali and uh she can't it's
[02:40:22.860 --> 02:40:30.700]  sort of like the situation with hurricane katrina she can't get back to bengali because um you know
[02:40:30.700 --> 02:40:36.300]  bengali is the stronghold of the rebels now the interesting thing what i've been told today i haven't
[02:40:36.300 --> 02:40:46.140]  checked it out yet but that there is uh sort of active israeli um intervention in in bengali and
[02:40:46.140 --> 02:40:52.300]  that the israelis are on the ground under contract probably being paid to organize uh
[02:40:52.300 --> 02:41:03.020]  over the the uh nato alliance of uh that consists of libyans but it's my understanding that these
[02:41:03.020 --> 02:41:12.380]  so-called rebels are not just libyans they are uh people from all over the region these are these
[02:41:12.380 --> 02:41:20.460]  are not even uh mainly libyans these are egyptians and algerians and it's the cia secret alcata
[02:41:20.460 --> 02:41:25.900]  member gates from the 1980s that's now been admitted uh and and there's us and british
[02:41:25.900 --> 02:41:31.900]  commandos have been there since before it started that's now uh confirmed uh this is absolutely
[02:41:31.900 --> 02:41:37.340]  incredible why did you decide to go to libya uh former congresswoman synthia mckinney
[02:41:37.340 --> 02:41:49.820]  well um i guess you know i'm um i'm accustomed to going into conflict zones and um i i just uh
[02:41:49.820 --> 02:42:00.140]  could not accept that this was being done in my name and you know it's there comes a point
[02:42:00.140 --> 02:42:07.180]  when you're fed up you're tired and you want to do as much as you can possibly do and of course i
[02:42:07.180 --> 02:42:15.020]  i come from the catholic tradition that instructs us that we have an obligation we have a responsibility
[02:42:15.020 --> 02:42:26.700]  to do as much as we are gifted to do and so being here was my way of of uh making a contribution
[02:42:26.700 --> 02:42:35.100]  and sure enough um the fact that i was here when the uh most intense bombardment of triply this
[02:42:35.100 --> 02:42:42.540]  is triply i mean can you imagine i'm not talking about you know out in the farmland uh where you
[02:42:42.540 --> 02:42:51.900]  just um uh disboiling the the agricultural land i'm talking about triply a metropolitan area of
[02:42:51.900 --> 02:42:58.700]  two million people and they're being uh hit with bombs i mean it is absolutely incredible and it's
[02:42:58.700 --> 02:43:08.140]  called humanitarian um what that has to do with any kind of humanitarian intervention is beyond me
[02:43:08.140 --> 02:43:16.300]  this is what we know the united states to be very good at and particularly on the african
[02:43:16.300 --> 02:43:24.300]  continent we've seen it over and over and over again individuals of wealth and resource who are
[02:43:24.300 --> 02:43:34.780]  able to pull the levers on us military and diplomatic policy are able to arm a small group
[02:43:34.780 --> 02:43:43.500]  of people give them the financial wherewithal to wreak havoc and terror on a population and then
[02:43:43.500 --> 02:43:51.980]  all of a sudden presto abracadabra you've got what what is called in the media a civil war well it's
[02:43:51.980 --> 02:43:58.620]  not a civil war it's a group of people who've decided that they want something that that particular
[02:43:58.620 --> 02:44:07.820]  area has for example in Sierra Leone it was diamonds and when the british sand line mercenaries went
[02:44:07.820 --> 02:44:15.820]  into the home of fode sanco what did they find there a letter from marise templesman proposing
[02:44:15.820 --> 02:44:25.340]  to do business so this is the kind of thing that motivates us policy and i am certain that at the
[02:44:25.340 --> 02:44:32.620]  end of an investigation were we to have one we would find that there are certain individuals
[02:44:32.620 --> 02:44:41.260]  involved in this and they are able to dictate to the president to cameron to sarcosi to all of the
[02:44:41.260 --> 02:44:47.900]  nato allies they are able to dictate them going to war well we know what it's about this is about
[02:44:47.900 --> 02:44:53.500]  the al-qaeda rebels have already set up their own bank they've already set up their their own oil
[02:44:53.500 --> 02:44:58.860]  company and it's about handing over the trillions in oil also the water say what you want about
[02:44:58.860 --> 02:45:04.620]  muhmar qaddafi he's built up an infrastructure he's actually delivered to the people the government
[02:45:04.620 --> 02:45:10.540]  spoils and it's become a major hub for all of africa and he's been developing africa and moving
[02:45:10.540 --> 02:45:18.460]  towards an african currency and a loan program he's got hundreds of billions in gold and other
[02:45:18.460 --> 02:45:24.300]  resources and you can say what you want about qaddafi but bottom line this is a takeover you
[02:45:24.300 --> 02:45:30.300]  know how can the neocon media call you a trader for being over there reporting the truth when it's
[02:45:30.300 --> 02:45:35.660]  admitted that what qaddafi said three months ago was true that the main force this is down the
[02:45:35.660 --> 02:45:42.860]  wall street journal and la times that is running all this is al qaeda and in fact the al qaeda commander
[02:45:42.860 --> 02:45:49.020]  under ci payroll admits that he killed us soldiers or commanded groups in in iraq so
[02:45:49.020 --> 02:45:54.700]  you're against people that killed us soldiers and so you're bad sent the uh i mean what's wrong
[02:45:54.700 --> 02:46:00.940]  just join al qaeda and the neocons are going to say you're great well that's exactly the point
[02:46:00.940 --> 02:46:08.220]  because we remember when robin cook the uh now deceased foreign minister in the of of the united
[02:46:08.220 --> 02:46:16.300]  kingdom had to say about al qaeda he just said it was the cia's rolodex so um it it is and he died
[02:46:16.300 --> 02:46:21.580]  a week later that killed him real fast and and they got rid of him yeah so so i mean you know it's
[02:46:21.580 --> 02:46:31.420]  not an uh the situation that the united states is allied with al qaeda is not unusual what is
[02:46:31.420 --> 02:46:39.100]  unusual is that they actually admit it because what they have been uh saying to the american people
[02:46:39.100 --> 02:46:48.140]  into the world is that al qaeda is the bad guy and that's who we've got to get but i will never forget
[02:46:48.140 --> 02:46:57.980]  that the op ed that was written by robin cook and so i advise everybody i know you talk about this
[02:46:57.980 --> 02:47:04.860]  and you you know you're one of the rare truth tellers and um so you will remember this but
[02:47:05.420 --> 02:47:12.940]  um the fact that we had someone of robin cook stature and position to tell us the truth about
[02:47:12.940 --> 02:47:18.380]  exactly what al qaeda was is very important is something not to be forgotten i agree and the
[02:47:18.380 --> 02:47:22.620]  word was he was going to come out and document that they'd murdered dr david kelly it's now
[02:47:22.620 --> 02:47:27.580]  coming out they murdered diana uh that's big news and and they couldn't allow him with that with
[02:47:27.580 --> 02:47:32.300]  that high level you know like number two or three in the british government they killed him so fast
[02:47:32.300 --> 02:47:38.220]  it made a everybody's headspin now now congresswoman this is so important what is the mood of the
[02:47:38.220 --> 02:47:44.300]  libeans under these these love bombs that are killing so many these humanitarian kinetic attacks
[02:47:44.940 --> 02:47:49.580]  and the word of the attack helicopter is coming more weapons don't bring this up because you're
[02:47:49.580 --> 02:47:55.420]  black uh it's it's in the news we reported it over a month ago uh that qaddafi's been
[02:47:55.420 --> 02:48:02.380]  allied with just a coalition and the tribes he's with are not anti black african uh and that the
[02:48:02.380 --> 02:48:08.140]  and it's admitted that they're lining up blacks and killing them uh in the areas held by al qaeda uh
[02:48:09.340 --> 02:48:16.220]  what's the word on that on the genocide against black africans in libya well here's another thing
[02:48:16.220 --> 02:48:24.700]  that is absolutely astounding and that is this whole idea that black people shouldn't be in africa
[02:48:24.700 --> 02:48:31.980]  which is something that was promulgated by the american press when i presume is that when they
[02:48:31.980 --> 02:48:37.900]  landed and they saw black people all over alivia they were shocked well the fact of the matter is
[02:48:37.900 --> 02:48:46.700]  that you've got a sizable chunk of black people in libya because you've got black people all over
[02:48:46.700 --> 02:48:56.060]  africa so uh you know it's just it's it's it's it's a horrible and it's insulting to the libyans
[02:48:56.060 --> 02:49:07.260]  themselves but and so now they have their own citizens who are being killed beheaded in fact
[02:49:07.260 --> 02:49:14.220]  i'm having the video of this i think uh there may be some footage of this on the internet already
[02:49:14.220 --> 02:49:23.180]  but i am getting it uploaded now so that i can disseminate it through my own network um of um
[02:49:23.180 --> 02:49:33.580]  um the the family members of those uh the libyans who were lynched they've gone to lynching and be
[02:49:33.580 --> 02:49:40.220]  headings of the blacks and this is being done by the nato allies because it's known that blacks on
[02:49:40.220 --> 02:49:44.700]  average are supportive of qaddafi because he he doesn't lynch them and chop their heads off now
[02:49:44.700 --> 02:49:52.140]  look what were alex in libya guess what people don't have to go through the insurance company in order
[02:49:52.140 --> 02:49:59.820]  to get to see their doctor they have free health care over here they don't have to go through a bank
[02:49:59.820 --> 02:50:06.140]  in order to uh have a relationship with their professor at a university because they have free
[02:50:06.140 --> 02:50:12.060]  education over here all the way up through the phd level you go to school and you don't pay
[02:50:12.060 --> 02:50:16.620]  no no i've studied libya i don't even agree with socialism because it only works if you have a
[02:50:16.620 --> 02:50:21.580]  benevolent dictator and i'm not saying he's that but qaddafi does take most the money and actually
[02:50:21.580 --> 02:50:26.620]  use it that i've you've been there many times i've seen the video the reports it is a shining
[02:50:26.620 --> 02:50:31.740]  jewel of development and they want that giant canal he's built that huge airport they built
[02:50:31.740 --> 02:50:37.500]  for african to launch attacks all over africa i mean really libya is the beachhead to really take
[02:50:37.500 --> 02:50:44.380]  over africa is that the word there that's right and in addition to that you have the the um the
[02:50:44.380 --> 02:50:54.940]  the european countries were trying to have some uh mediterranean alliance and what they proposed
[02:50:54.940 --> 02:51:04.380]  was that the african countries on the mediterranean literal be joined in a uh economic arrangement
[02:51:04.380 --> 02:51:13.820]  with all of europe and qaddafi was the one who said no that's not fair if it's all of europe
[02:51:14.540 --> 02:51:23.660]  then it ought to be all of africa and so he put a stop to that particular plan and so that is in
[02:51:23.660 --> 02:51:30.540]  limbo now but of course you know nothing would be in limbo if you got those uh puppets the nato
[02:51:30.540 --> 02:51:38.540]  allies in control and recognized as a legitimate government of libya sent the incredible sent
[02:51:38.540 --> 02:51:45.420]  the incredible uh what are the bombardments like what are you witnessing what is the feeling of
[02:51:45.420 --> 02:51:57.020]  the libyan people uh that you've uh met with well um i i had so many libyans you know it's kind of
[02:51:57.020 --> 02:52:07.740]  obvious that i'm an american and um once i open my mouth and so uh they asked me why why are they
[02:52:07.740 --> 02:52:17.260]  if you see americans doing this because you know um qaddafi made many confessions and invited the
[02:52:17.260 --> 02:52:21.980]  american companies and i mean you know that he made a deal he gave up the weapons he kissed their
[02:52:21.980 --> 02:52:29.740]  romp i mean he did everything that's right and and uh uh the the american companies are here they're
[02:52:29.740 --> 02:52:37.580]  here in full force and and even that wasn't good enough now there's another thing that i'll be
[02:52:37.580 --> 02:52:45.260]  writing a little bit more about and that's supposed to be the um geological survey that the libyan
[02:52:45.260 --> 02:52:54.220]  government had just to ascertain exactly what their resources were and the extent of whatever the
[02:52:54.220 --> 02:53:04.460]  mineral reserves were that they had and it apparently it came back that uh libya had far more
[02:53:07.180 --> 02:53:14.380]  oil resources than uh they previously now the word is instead of one trillion five trillion
[02:53:14.380 --> 02:53:20.700]  the oil worth it uh almost as much as all the rest of the oil that's been discovered in africa
[02:53:20.700 --> 02:53:27.820]  from the numbers i've seen and one of the biggest areas with deep aquifers of water now now now we've
[02:53:27.820 --> 02:53:32.220]  only got about seven eight minutes left with congresswoman sythia mckinney former congresswoman
[02:53:32.220 --> 02:53:36.380]  what are the best websites for people to read your reports of what's really happening in libya
[02:53:36.380 --> 02:53:41.340]  and and and other key points that you'd like to add for the international media that is undoubtedly
[02:53:41.340 --> 02:53:50.620]  going to pick up on this interview today well um i uh presumed that uh people could go to my facebook
[02:53:50.620 --> 02:53:58.060]  page or twitter and they can get the dispatches that i send out i'm in the process of preparing one
[02:53:58.060 --> 02:54:05.420]  now about how the katachi family members were murdered i went and visited that compound and
[02:54:05.420 --> 02:54:10.780]  and and that is amazing it's not even a compound it's a house in a residential neighborhood i mean
[02:54:10.780 --> 02:54:15.340]  and that's illegal too i mean they're they're they're bombing houses they're trying to kill
[02:54:15.340 --> 02:54:20.460]  him and his family and then tell them the public oh we're not doing that i know it is just patent
[02:54:20.460 --> 02:54:26.140]  lies now you asked about what it's like to be here i mean you know it's like every time that i'm in a
[02:54:26.140 --> 02:54:31.900]  hotel room and every time the air conditioner comes on you know i kind of jump because i know it's
[02:54:31.900 --> 02:54:40.220]  dark now and the bombardment is going to start and uh so any kind of popper you know i i i i
[02:54:40.220 --> 02:54:46.940]  i've only been through it what three or four nights now and can you imagine what our soldiers
[02:54:47.660 --> 02:54:53.180]  go you know are like when they come back with post traumatic stress syndrome uh when they go through
[02:54:53.180 --> 02:55:00.140]  it night after night for you for month after month for year after year um this is and the effect
[02:55:01.260 --> 02:55:09.820]  on the children and on the on average ordinary civilians who are in no way you know we don't
[02:55:09.820 --> 02:55:17.420]  even know what the nato design is other than to kill catastrophe and to take over the country
[02:55:17.420 --> 02:55:21.260]  and we know that the folks on the east a lot of them want to slaughter the folks on the west
[02:55:21.260 --> 02:55:26.140]  old tribal differences and i'm sure just like the un has helped carry out massacres and rwandan
[02:55:26.140 --> 02:55:31.420]  other areas they can't wait uh to help out there uh they're going to help folks with this humanitarian
[02:55:31.420 --> 02:55:35.020]  mass murder and now what do you make of the russians coming out and saying this is not a
[02:55:35.020 --> 02:55:40.380]  humanitarian they're going to try to go to the un and and and put a veto in what do you expect to
[02:55:40.380 --> 02:55:45.180]  happen there pakistan now says the us is getting ready to start a war with them the chinese are
[02:55:45.180 --> 02:55:49.580]  saying they're ready to go toe to toe i mean it looks like we're moving towards world war three
[02:55:49.580 --> 02:55:54.860]  all with the left cover of obama up there well of course that's why he was put in a business
[02:55:54.860 --> 02:56:02.620]  start with you know um and uh so yes i'm not surprised that all of this would be happening under
[02:56:02.620 --> 02:56:09.100]  president obama's watch um and then of course we still have the cold warriors who believe
[02:56:09.100 --> 02:56:16.300]  that russia and china are the ultimate and penultimate uh enemies of the united states and so
[02:56:16.300 --> 02:56:26.380]  rather than seeing the world as a global community they see the world as um a collection of rivalries
[02:56:26.380 --> 02:56:34.380]  that uh need to be overcome and uh so i for one if the the russians or the chinese
[02:56:35.100 --> 02:56:40.940]  are ready to put an end to what is happening here in libya i would say thank you very much
[02:56:40.940 --> 02:56:47.500]  for helping bring some sanity back into well i'll say this policy i would be against the russians
[02:56:47.500 --> 02:56:51.260]  when they were taken over eastern europe and and against that i was for the berlin wall falling
[02:56:51.260 --> 02:56:56.620]  i don't like the any tyrants we have become that you don't see russia and china blowing
[02:56:56.620 --> 02:57:02.460]  countries up everywhere no and in fact if you if you look at what the chinese have done i've
[02:57:02.460 --> 02:57:08.380]  i've seen the tangible results of what the chinese have provided in terms of development
[02:57:08.380 --> 02:57:13.100]  assistance around the african continent well that's the word that african's going in
[02:57:13.100 --> 02:57:18.780]  and the pentagon admits this to block the chinese developing africa yes that's right and the worst
[02:57:18.780 --> 02:57:24.700]  thing of course you know the whole from the whole idea about uh what's the what's the threat the the
[02:57:24.700 --> 02:57:31.980]  threat only um can be carried out if there is a means by which to do so and as long as you
[02:57:31.980 --> 02:57:38.540]  keep people poor and deprived then they do not have the ability to challenge you whether it's
[02:57:38.540 --> 02:57:45.260]  in areas of finance or is in education or science or whatever then you can remain top exactly shifting
[02:57:45.260 --> 02:57:48.780]  gears was almost out of time we're going to one minute break if you stay five more five but i don't
[02:57:48.780 --> 02:57:53.260]  know yet congresswoman what do you make i know you're over in libya bravely under bombardments

[02:57:57.500 --> 02:58:03.180]  happening you know how dare you go give another view on things what do you make of the demonization

[02:58:12.940 --> 02:58:19.100]  washington times los angeles times and the washington post los angeles times in the new
[02:58:19.100 --> 02:58:24.380]  york times reporters and the first thing that came out of their mouth to me was you're so courageous
[02:58:24.380 --> 02:58:31.820]  to be here but you know they would never print it and so uh at the end of the day it goes with the
[02:58:31.820 --> 02:58:36.060]  territory of telling the truth that's right our job's easy we just tell the truth but if you have
