[24:03.800 --> 24:19.720]  the alex jones show because there is a war on for your mind
[24:33.800 --> 24:45.560]  the first shot rang out and you know i grew up in the south i'm used to hearing a an occasional
[24:45.560 --> 24:50.200]  shotgun and i wasn't sure it didn't sound like a shotgun but it did sound like a rifle
[24:50.200 --> 24:53.720]  and then there were a couple of seconds everybody kind of looked up and heard the sound
[24:53.720 --> 24:57.560]  but we were about ready to go back around our business nobody dropped to the ground nobody
[24:57.560 --> 25:03.800]  ducked nobody did anything that i could see but then five or ten shots in a row very quickly rang out
[25:03.800 --> 25:09.480]  and uh that's when everybody was hitting the dirt i saw scolese go down at second base
[25:10.360 --> 25:14.040]  there were staffers running from the perimeter of the outfield from the third base sign where the
[25:14.040 --> 25:21.160]  shooter was all the way to where i was so i was in the far perimeter of right field and i often give
[25:21.160 --> 25:26.760]  senator flake a ride home and just about a minute before i'd been at the batting at at home plate
[25:26.760 --> 25:31.240]  and i walked by him at the dugout and i said i'm going to go one more time for one more batting
[25:31.240 --> 25:36.760]  cage in the right field and as it turns out that was at the farthest point so i'm in the right field
[25:36.760 --> 25:41.720]  i'm at the farthest point on the field of anybody from the gunshots but the gunshots are still hitting
[25:41.720 --> 25:47.160]  in the dirt in right field where there are two staffers laying on the ground i think one of them
[25:47.160 --> 25:53.080]  may have been hit but there are between me and them is about a 15 20 foot fence so one of the
[25:53.080 --> 25:58.200]  staffers decides the heck with this i'm not staying here the bullets are flying all around me he
[25:58.200 --> 26:03.800]  decided to climb the fence and he climbed the 20 foot fence in about three seconds plopped down
[26:03.800 --> 26:08.760]  behind me and there was a big oak tree behind the batting cage he and i are behind the oak tree
[26:08.760 --> 26:13.240]  but the gunshots are still going in the dirt in right field in the warning tracks so about five
[26:13.240 --> 26:21.080]  or ten feet from us and at at some point i'd say 50 or 60 shots at least have been fired from
[26:21.080 --> 26:28.200]  from the from the shooter and then we start to hear a the Capitol Hill police respond and there's
[26:28.200 --> 26:35.480]  a different weapon so you hear pistol shots going back at the shooter i can tell you that i think
[26:35.480 --> 26:40.120]  with absolute certainty nobody would have survived without the Capitol Hill police they saved everybody's
[26:40.120 --> 26:47.480]  life uh incredibly brave and deserve everyone's praise and reportedly as many as three police
[26:47.480 --> 26:54.920]  officers have been shot the gunman has been killed an admitted crazed democrat we have his social
[26:54.920 --> 27:01.880]  media information up on info wars dot com where he called for the destruction of trump the destruction
[27:02.760 --> 27:10.360]  of the republicans truly sickening uh information i felt like i was back in iraq without my weapon
[27:10.360 --> 27:17.960]  congressman wounded in baseball pitch mass shooting representative steve's police shot in congressional
[27:17.960 --> 27:29.080]  baseball game that is now being reported james t hodgkinson dies after the shootout 66 years old
[27:29.080 --> 27:34.600]  from illinois was killed in the shootout with police first they were saying three were wounded
[27:34.600 --> 27:40.040]  now they're saying two were wounded we're still not sure the wounded also include two
[27:40.040 --> 27:47.480]  capital police officers the congressional aid and a lobbyist so that is a total of five people
[27:48.920 --> 27:55.240]  ladies and gentlemen we got six of you count the gunman these are people that believe they're
[27:55.240 --> 28:01.480]  doing good because kathy griffin and all these other folks and people producing plays are saying
[28:01.480 --> 28:06.440]  kill trump and the newspapers are seeing saying kill trump and they're saying he's a nazi they're
[28:06.440 --> 28:14.680]  saying he's hitler they're saying his supporters are so they come up to families with clubs and with
[28:14.680 --> 28:23.000]  mace and with rocks and with bike locks and just club people's heads in savagely just screaming
[28:24.840 --> 28:28.680]  and what's scary is i've been to a lot of these demonstrations you've all watched countless ones
[28:28.680 --> 28:34.840]  i'm sure you've been to many of them yourselves the leftist are the closest thing to the walking
[28:34.840 --> 28:40.680]  dead they just stomp around they walk weird their hair's all bozoed out their eyes don't
[28:40.680 --> 28:46.760]  point the right direction they scream and and and just can't even hardly talk and we're not just
[28:46.760 --> 28:53.240]  picking and choosing a few of them to make them look bad we've all watched it or if you've tried
[28:53.240 --> 28:59.320]  you can see it for yourself people that don't act like they're human anymore completely whacked
[28:59.320 --> 29:05.320]  out of their brains who believe television is real who believe fake news like cnn is real
[29:05.320 --> 29:11.800]  who believe abc is real who believe nbc is real fake news like meghan kelly and they watch it
[29:11.800 --> 29:17.160]  and they really believe those of us being attacked aren't human and that we're really bad trying to
[29:17.160 --> 29:21.320]  cut their taxes and we're really bad trying to bring their jobs back and we're really bad
[29:21.320 --> 29:27.160]  trying to keep ices out of the country and we're we're really bad trying to fix the va and we're
[29:27.160 --> 29:33.960]  we're horrible people that have to die and so they go out in the attack imagine what the
[29:33.960 --> 29:41.800]  democrats would be doing right now because this was purely politically motivated he said it's time
[29:41.800 --> 29:48.600]  to destroy trump and co congressional shooter recently wrote we need to tweet that out at
[29:48.600 --> 29:55.960]  real alec shone's there on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[30:00.680 --> 30:05.080]  so the democrats are getting what they wanted well it seems all these calls for violence
[30:05.080 --> 30:09.880]  are finally working majority whip representative steve scolese out of louisiana was shot this
[30:09.880 --> 30:14.600]  morning along with several other aides and capital guards and already there are some amazing quotes
[30:14.600 --> 30:18.120]  coming out of the situation representative ran paul said it would have been a massacre had
[30:18.120 --> 30:23.000]  there not been good guys with guns representative ron de santis recounted an odd encounter he had
[30:23.000 --> 30:26.200]  as he was leaving the field just before the shooting there's a guy that walked up to us and
[30:26.200 --> 30:30.040]  asked whether it was the republicans or democrats out there and it was just a little odd de santis
[30:30.040 --> 30:33.880]  told fox one of the most harrowing accounts is from representative mo brooks who talks about
[30:33.880 --> 30:38.200]  taking refuge inside the dugout applying tourniquets to another injured person and then running out to
[30:38.200 --> 30:42.200]  the field to help representatives glee supply pressure to his wound but here is one of the most
[30:42.200 --> 30:46.600]  important things he said it's not easy when you see people around you being shot and you don't have
[30:46.600 --> 30:50.440]  a weapon yourself now democrats are going to come out of the woodwork and call for more gun control
[30:50.440 --> 30:54.440]  but at this time we should not be relinquishing any of our rights especially in this climate of
[30:54.440 --> 30:58.600]  violence that is all being sown by the democrats and leftists rob do reporting for info wars dot

[33:12.840 --> 33:21.400]  i don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that
[33:21.400 --> 33:32.120]  the russians ran an extensive information war campaign against my campaign to influence voters
[33:32.120 --> 33:39.480]  in the election and then they began to weaponize them and they began to have some of their allies
[33:39.480 --> 33:47.720]  within the uh internet world like info wars take out pieces and began to say the most outrageous
[33:47.720 --> 33:54.920]  outlandish absurd lies you can imagine but trump doesn't challenge these lies he actually went on
[33:54.920 --> 34:05.480]  jones's show and said your reputation is amazing i will not let you down waging war on corruption

[34:26.440 --> 34:31.400]  the cable and satellite and a lot more already on some cable and satellite systems but massive
[34:31.400 --> 34:36.200]  expansion we're working on here pretty soon because america and the world is awakening
[34:36.200 --> 34:40.120]  you've never had more listeners never had more support want to thank you all for your prayers
[34:40.120 --> 34:46.680]  and your support but we're expanding because the enemy is coming in like a flood you have got
[34:46.680 --> 34:51.560]  thousands and thousands of newspapers because i look at hundreds every day almost every paper
[34:51.560 --> 34:57.000]  in the country i've seen has had op ed saying kill trump organizes overthrow atlantic monthly has
[34:57.000 --> 35:03.160]  just said organize a military coup we have seen kathy griffin uh you know come out with her
[35:03.160 --> 35:08.120]  activity we have seen countless other hollywood producers and others say absolutely let's kill
[35:08.120 --> 35:16.120]  him we've seen cnbc an msnbc host come out and say we need isis to bomb trump facilities trump
[35:16.120 --> 35:22.120]  tower this is calling for known terror groups to carry out attacks this is aiding and abetting
[35:22.120 --> 35:28.280]  enemies that's why i said two days ago in media matters run by the democrats and george soros
[35:28.280 --> 35:33.560]  picked it up and said alex jones says he's ready for trump to move with military action
[35:34.440 --> 35:40.760]  dr um coursey uh former counterterrorism specialist banking specialist uh best-selling
[35:40.760 --> 35:47.640]  author he was on when i said that i don't want a coup they're involved in the coup an active attempt
[35:47.640 --> 35:54.600]  to start a bloody civil war so in case you forgot here's just a small snippet of some of the democratic
[35:54.600 --> 36:01.640]  leaders recently uh and hollywood people like madonna saying kill trump blow up the winehouse
[36:01.640 --> 36:08.600]  saying that on major platforms like it's acceptable it's going to happen so this is clearly
[36:08.600 --> 36:15.080]  directly terror attacks just like when the leader of isis gets up on youtube or gets up on the internet
[36:15.080 --> 36:22.200]  says run over people with cars kill the infidels go bomb them they go out they bomb they go out
[36:22.200 --> 36:27.320]  they shoot they go out and run people over when they said invade europe three years ago uh as part
[36:27.320 --> 36:34.600]  of isis takeover three million extra people came in 80 military age men it's the same thing we target
[36:34.600 --> 36:40.520]  isis with weapons we target them with bombs well when you've got the democratic party openly saying
[36:40.520 --> 36:45.240]  kill trump kill trump supporters attack their supporters in the streets with clubs killing
[36:45.240 --> 36:52.840]  people it is not the president's right it is the president's duty and the justice department's duty
[36:52.840 --> 36:57.240]  to start arresting and indicting people and if they want to go for a full civil war at that point
[36:57.240 --> 37:01.000]  we got to call the army out the street ladies and gentlemen and anybody running around burning
[37:01.000 --> 37:05.720]  stuff down or killing people needs to get a rocket promel grenade shot at them and i'm not looking
[37:05.720 --> 37:11.560]  for a civil war but if you come start one we're going to kick your ass get that through your
[37:11.560 --> 37:17.400]  globalist commie trader heads we are ready to kick your ass we know we're going to defeat you and
[37:17.400 --> 37:21.960]  meghan kelly we're going to beat the rogue cia we're going to restore the republic already most
[37:21.960 --> 37:26.760]  of cia and the pentagon are on our side so if you people really want to start it with 50 million
[37:26.760 --> 37:32.760]  veterans and millions of people in our military who are almost all awake good luck sjw is because
[37:32.760 --> 37:37.480]  you are reaping the wind you're about to get the whirlwind right now let's go to that one minute
[37:37.480 --> 37:42.920]  clip his wife said oh he's a tough guy he's not a tough guy he's a bully and he's a bitch and he
[37:42.920 --> 37:49.320]  can suck my and i'll meet him in the hotel room any other day of the week and give him a louisville

[38:07.160 --> 38:20.280]  an awful lot about blowing up the white house
[38:23.480 --> 38:29.320]  stupid dog killing the president and then his nephew says sex life
[38:29.320 --> 38:37.560]  kidnap the president's wife and sex slave and then kathy griffin saying let's kill trump together
[38:38.360 --> 38:44.600]  that's nothing compared to the plays the movies the tv shows but remember kathy griffin then came
[38:44.600 --> 38:49.240]  out last week and cried and said trump broke her she's just calling for mass violence and then
[38:49.240 --> 38:54.200]  trump called her despicable and so that was bullying when he called her pushing for his death
[38:54.200 --> 38:59.960]  and terrorizing his family and baron who thought it was real when he spoke out and called it
[39:00.600 --> 39:06.840]  disgusting that was bullying let's let's play that clip and there's no mistaking the
[39:07.960 --> 39:14.200]  i don't think i will have a career after this i think he i think he i think he i'm gonna be honest
[39:14.200 --> 39:24.760]  he broke me he broke me now let's talk about where this spin is going to go with Dr. Jerome
[39:24.760 --> 39:30.280]  Corsi a psychological warfare expert and battling communist islamists you name it let's talk about
[39:30.280 --> 39:33.800]  what they're going to do they're going to talk about gaby geffords being shot by a mental patient
[39:33.800 --> 39:40.520]  who was a democrat who was taking hallucinogens every day for years and had a satanic altar in
[39:40.520 --> 39:46.760]  his backyard and went and killed uh you know shot some folks and wounded her because he was completely
[39:46.760 --> 39:51.800]  out of his mind that's totally different than the democrats everywhere it'd be one thing of
[39:51.800 --> 39:56.440]  republicans you know back when giffords got shot we're saying go kill congress people go kill the
[39:56.440 --> 40:01.800]  president you know go after obama and then it happened you could try to pin it on republicans
[40:01.800 --> 40:07.880]  you can't do that because they weren't calling for it the democrats are frothing like kujo with
[40:07.880 --> 40:14.040]  rabies to attack from supporters to bully people to fire people to boycott people to kill the president
[40:14.040 --> 40:20.280]  to put his wife in sex slavery so giffords has now come out and said her heart is with
[40:20.280 --> 40:27.560]  my former colleagues well great please then speak out against the democrats calling for all of these
[40:27.560 --> 40:33.080]  attacks of course trumps come out and said representative steve's calise of louisiana is a
[40:33.080 --> 40:40.760]  true friend and breaks down the fact that this is all a very very serious tragedy again let me
[40:40.760 --> 40:45.480]  read you the trump quote if we can we can pause that i can representative steve's calise of louisiana
[40:45.480 --> 40:49.880]  is a friend a true friend a patriot and was badly injured but will fully recover our thoughts
[40:50.520 --> 40:56.280]  and prayers are with him we need trump to tweet this is democrats inspired terrorism
[40:56.280 --> 41:03.960]  directly caused by their organized concerted effort to start a bloody civil war which they're
[41:03.960 --> 41:09.640]  going to kick off i mean this is beyond war propaganda to launch the spanish-american war
[41:09.640 --> 41:19.880]  in in 1898 or the gulf war of 2003 i mean this is classic pr major rollout demonizing trump
[41:19.880 --> 41:26.120]  demonizing myself lying about what we say lying about what we stand for saying things we
[41:26.120 --> 41:32.040]  never said a full court press as dr corsey said monday they're preparing a civil war
[41:32.600 --> 41:37.800]  probably in july they're preparing everybody for trump to be assassinated and they're preparing
[41:37.800 --> 41:43.960]  to try to trigger mass shootings that will make the republicans rollover and fear and mass shootings
[41:43.960 --> 41:51.480]  of police under strong cities hoping they roll over with black lives and soros and others openly
[41:51.480 --> 41:57.960]  pushing this saying you give in to us and you do what we want or we're going to activate through
[41:57.960 --> 42:03.720]  the media through the hype more mentally ill people and more black lives matter to come kill
[42:03.720 --> 42:07.560]  you and you watch you're going to see a bunch of cops get killed now they've activated they've
[42:07.560 --> 42:12.440]  activated there you're going to see more politicians and more republicans shot i've got to have you
[42:12.440 --> 42:19.080]  know security it's on ladies and gentlemen so they've they've they've rewritten the rules of
[42:19.080 --> 42:25.400]  succession to kill trump or overthrow him and to remove all republicans elected in the last election
[42:26.200 --> 42:31.720]  this is the official democratic party through the elite atlantic monthly they're also singing in
[42:31.720 --> 42:37.640]  new yorker magazine deep state moles continue government plan to overthrow trump they mean
[42:37.640 --> 42:44.840]  business they are a foreign multinational force now dr corsey literally wrote the book not just his
[42:44.840 --> 42:50.840]  other number one new york times bestsellers but wrote the book on nafta and gat and tpp imf world
[42:50.840 --> 42:56.680]  bank world government lewdobbs he was one of lewdobbs's top advisors lewdobbs a great hero had
[42:56.680 --> 43:01.800]  top ratings at cnn even better than you know a riley had when he got fired fired because he was
[43:01.800 --> 43:06.920]  leading the charge against globalism in the end of the country they may have fired him but still
[43:06.920 --> 43:11.880]  we all owe lewdobbs a round of applause for the success with tpp the paris and everything but
[43:11.880 --> 43:18.120]  core seat was at the tip of the spirit still is exposing globalism trump's great crime is pulling
[43:18.120 --> 43:24.120]  us out of it so these foreign multinationals are working with islamist leftist communist the same
[43:24.120 --> 43:30.440]  ones i saw attacking our reporters this week in austin preparing a massive folks i never saw
[43:30.440 --> 43:35.320]  communists on the street hardly in my life except in like new york i see them everywhere now in austin
[43:35.320 --> 43:39.640]  they have attacked our crew repeatedly they're all over the country they're activating they're
[43:39.640 --> 43:44.280]  getting ready for their big move you've been totally on target doctor coursey you're with us
[43:44.280 --> 43:48.680]  to the bottom of the hour next hour when other guests join us but i just want listeners to know
[43:48.680 --> 43:54.920]  i'm a little bit you know upset here because we told you it was all coming we've studied history
[43:54.920 --> 43:59.240]  we've studied the globalist we've studied how they foment the arab spring and other civil wars
[43:59.240 --> 44:03.080]  how they tried to overthrow russia we're not saying russia's perfect but the same globalists
[44:03.080 --> 44:07.720]  have been trying to overthrow russia they're trying to overthrow us okay so the only russia
[44:07.720 --> 44:12.440]  connection is we're under attack by the same dirtbags doctor coursey well i mean first of all
[44:12.440 --> 44:20.680]  let's put it in context when 1960 when the uh would jack kennedy won uh richard nixon said well
[44:20.680 --> 44:26.840]  we might have lost the election by vote fraud in illinois but i'm not going to contest it and that
[44:26.840 --> 44:35.640]  was all fair it was easy to let it go now what happened is get to 2000 and el gore says no i'm
[44:35.640 --> 44:41.800]  going to contest it in the courts we gotta realize is that the these democrats have now gone completely
[44:41.800 --> 44:47.080]  over to the other side they're they're off the cliff they're marxists they're beyond over the
[44:47.080 --> 44:53.080]  cliff they are frothing terrorist yes i mean for real well and and they're going to use violence
[44:53.080 --> 44:58.120]  they've gone right to the solowansky right to the belaris playbook they have completely embraced it
[44:58.120 --> 45:04.280]  the what you have here this is austin this weekend you have a failure of the democratic party to accept
[45:04.280 --> 45:09.480]  the legitimacy of an election in which donald trump was elected the democratic party is going to
[45:09.480 --> 45:14.680]  obstruct they're going to use violence they're going to use riots they're going to use soros
[45:14.680 --> 45:21.160]  funded thugs they were the inauguration was the beginning of this which was violent activity
[45:22.040 --> 45:27.880]  breaking windows assaulting people who wanted to go into the inauguration this is in the streets
[45:27.880 --> 45:32.520]  now and we have newsweek and time staying a case for rioting and the hubby can post saying get violent
[45:32.520 --> 45:37.480]  aren't these people going to get held accountable who are calling for organized crime well what they're
[45:37.480 --> 45:42.360]  going to do is the the deep state in the left the democrats are going to blame trump for this
[45:42.360 --> 45:47.240]  they're going to say it's all trump's fault is because of trump's policies and trump look
[45:47.240 --> 45:54.520]  they were right at the edge of having globalism take over to have an islamic state on the way
[45:54.520 --> 45:59.240]  to be created in the united states if hillary had won we would have seen massive massive
[45:59.240 --> 46:03.960]  of eliminations of freedom first amendment would have been under because she's a villain they get
[46:03.960 --> 46:09.560]  off on this and it's at the heart of the democratic party everybody's got to understand this is not
[46:09.560 --> 46:15.160]  the democratic party of jack kennedy this is the democratic party it's a malice party it's
[46:15.160 --> 46:22.280]  basically thugs it's basically funded by soros and it's out there in the streets to win power
[46:22.280 --> 46:26.920]  through a civil war what they're going to do is they're going to you're going to see an up
[46:26.920 --> 46:32.200]  tick now of violence this is just beginning it's a and donald trump of the white house has got to
[46:32.200 --> 46:38.760]  realize this he's in this for his life in and also for the future if there's any future for the
[46:38.760 --> 46:44.840]  republic donald trump has got to start using the enormous powers of the presidency first of all
[46:44.840 --> 46:49.720]  jeff sessions yesterday they didn't get jeff sessions the democrats were gunning for him and jeff
[46:49.720 --> 46:55.800]  sessions outsmarted them so now they're going to up the ante they want the special prosecutor we've
[46:55.800 --> 47:02.760]  got muller he's hiring a whole bunch of democrats in there who are going to be hillary people who
[47:02.760 --> 47:06.440]  donated to hillary these are people who hate trump and we're going to get back into that in a minute
[47:06.440 --> 47:10.680]  but but but dr. coursey we're not just saying this we've been telling everybody this is coming
[47:10.680 --> 47:15.320]  that's why they hate us that's why info wars is public enemy number one because they know
[47:15.960 --> 47:21.560]  let's get matt bracken on today by the way guys they know is that we know their battle plan and it
[47:21.560 --> 47:25.960]  totally freaks them out that we've laid it all out before they even laid it out and so we've got
[47:25.960 --> 47:31.080]  to stop them this is a clear and present danger this is mainstream media organizing mass murder
[47:31.080 --> 47:36.760]  criminally i mean what does the president do he has to move against these people first of all
[47:36.760 --> 47:43.880]  you've got it's a prop it started with a propaganda campaign the idea was to begin by saying uh look
[47:43.880 --> 47:50.600]  the russians stole the election well that that meme is is gone because it's obviously clear there's
[47:50.600 --> 47:55.000]  no evidence of the russians did anything it was hillary and podesta were working and being paid
[47:55.000 --> 47:59.240]  by the russians they're not going to be investigated we've got a politicized department of justice
[47:59.240 --> 48:04.600]  that will not investigate the obvious crimes of hillary podesta the democrats cylinder of
[48:04.600 --> 48:08.040]  the list so they're going to move on to civil unrest and they're going to move on to obstruction
[48:08.040 --> 48:12.440]  of justice of a non-crime okay now what president trump's going to do he's got to realize that first
[48:12.440 --> 48:18.200]  of all this is a war and it's going to be a civil war and it's going to be violent so the powers of
[48:18.200 --> 48:23.960]  the presidency have to be exerted first of all uh don trump's gotta say no more hearings that's it
[48:23.960 --> 48:28.520]  no more hearing we're done with the hearings and he has to start arresting some of the moles
[48:29.080 --> 48:34.760]  in the government that have been leaking under sedition if he can link them to foreign combines
[48:34.760 --> 48:41.080]  not just governments he has to use he has to use those those acts of espionage because this is
[48:41.080 --> 48:45.160]  globalism so if they're on a corporate board and are trying to sell the country out it's just like
[48:45.160 --> 48:49.720]  working for the chinese he needs to start arresting him well and also i mean get a control fire
[48:49.720 --> 48:56.760]  previous you've got a whole bunch of uh the gop elite previous's meal ticket is the donors to the
[48:56.760 --> 49:03.480]  republican national uh committee it's it's ryan mcconnell he doesn't care if trump goes down he's
[49:03.480 --> 49:10.200]  got a job get rid of previous and clean out all of the throughout the administration people who've
[49:10.200 --> 49:15.000]  had jobs with obama that what does he do if they're learning if if he learns they're preparing
[49:15.000 --> 49:19.560]  a physical coup which they're openly priming the public for right he's got to move i mean he's
[49:19.560 --> 49:25.240]  got to move against these criminals if first step is to get a hold of his own house and to put an end
[49:25.240 --> 49:32.360]  no more no more hearings that's done special prosecutor pardon general flinn and that's the end
[49:32.360 --> 49:37.320]  of the special and let's remember because the clinton's pardon a bunch of people and the clintons
[49:37.320 --> 49:42.120]  wouldn't go to hearings and loretta lynch wouldn't go to hearings and and susan rice wouldn't go
[49:42.120 --> 49:45.800]  none of these people who go to hearings why why why is trumps people going to hearings it should
[49:45.800 --> 49:50.840]  stop it right now so that's it there's no evidence that russian meme that's done we're not going to
[49:50.840 --> 49:56.200]  talk about that anymore obstruction of justice president's got to say look i had the full authority
[49:56.200 --> 50:01.960]  to tell the department of justice what to do full authority to fire combi full authority to inquire
[50:01.960 --> 50:08.360]  about an about an investigation full authority to start or stop an fbi investigation this nonsense
[50:08.360 --> 50:13.880]  of obstruction of justice does not apply i agree with you but we're going to break what does he
[50:13.880 --> 50:19.560]  do now when black lives matter fun about soros and others are openly saying kill cops that's
[50:19.560 --> 50:25.800]  racketeering that's organized crime that is that is preparing murder one we cannot put up with this
[50:25.800 --> 50:30.680]  and their intimidation anymore it's time to move and start by criminal prosecutions and
[50:30.680 --> 50:34.520]  investigations of people who threaten the president's you're threatened violent it's a good start with
[50:34.520 --> 50:39.880]  this winner loser you know this little commie crazy taliban chick help they throw her under the
[50:39.880 --> 50:44.360]  prison and a hundred more there's plenty of them that's gonna go after the leakers they
[50:44.360 --> 50:48.760]  got to go after anybody who threatens violence it's a crime it's got to be put by the way folks

[54:48.520 --> 54:53.560]  we're teamed up here at info wars and it's not about credit you have to understand why the number
[54:53.560 --> 54:59.000]  one story in the country until this tragic shooting at the republican baseball game today by craze leftist
[54:59.000 --> 55:04.840]  who had said on facebook and twitter and other publications i'm going out to bring down trump
[55:04.840 --> 55:09.720]  let's put some of his quotes up on screen there's poll lots and articles and others uh congressional
[55:09.720 --> 55:17.320]  shooter recently wrote it's time to destroy trump and co here's the deal when you have
[55:17.320 --> 55:22.040]  all over the country democrats now marching with guns with their fingers on the trigger it's not
[55:22.040 --> 55:26.760]  like us an open carry to defend the second amendment we're saying hi to the cops and everybody's
[55:26.760 --> 55:31.080]  being safe and you know the guns aren't loaded and all the rest of it we have the right form to be
[55:31.080 --> 55:35.560]  but we're not trying to have a mass shootout we go out there they got fingers on their triggers
[55:35.560 --> 55:40.840]  and then we're coming over and hitting my reporters give me any idea how dangerous this is this is

[1:00:43.880 --> 1:00:49.080]  in the short segment we're going to come back and lay out more with the Capitol shooting outside
[1:00:49.080 --> 1:00:54.280]  the Capitol of the Republican baseball game Rand Paul was almost hit another congressman was four
[1:00:54.280 --> 1:00:59.800]  others were shot as well the gunman was killed Dr. Corsi during the break you were saying you've
[1:00:59.800 --> 1:01:05.160]  been warning of this for over 15 years now we're here the Democrats openly want a violent revolution
[1:01:05.160 --> 1:01:11.080]  well i've been writing about this you know going back to 2004 trying to warn people that this was
[1:01:11.080 --> 1:01:17.800]  really a revolution this is really the far hard left now in complete deciding that they can take
[1:01:17.800 --> 1:01:23.400]  over now they were desperately disappointed they didn't win with Hillary they had their agenda all
[1:01:23.400 --> 1:01:27.880]  planned they were going to go into the Paris climate accord they were going to expand the
[1:01:27.880 --> 1:01:33.240]  relationships with the EU we're going to open our borders all the things that Trump was opposed to
[1:01:33.240 --> 1:01:38.440]  and now they're just desperate the the point is Donald Trump has got to understand the
[1:01:38.440 --> 1:01:43.960]  presidency's got to understand that this is a war and he's got to get control of the administration
[1:01:44.600 --> 1:01:49.480]  got to fire people who were there from holdovers and he's not going to make them happy giving
[1:01:49.480 --> 1:01:53.640]  them a new liberal health care bill a bunch of free stuff like he's trying they don't care the
[1:01:53.640 --> 1:01:59.160]  minions of this just want to burn America and secondly i mean this is the whole core of this
[1:01:59.160 --> 1:02:06.280]  where the Democrats are is now truly hate America and destroy America this is a don't make any
[1:02:06.280 --> 1:02:11.000]  any mistake the Democrats have become a communist party they're trying to form a revolution that's
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:17.160]  what this obstruct is about and president Trump's got to get a hold even in the White House of the
[1:02:17.160 --> 1:02:22.840]  message every time you've got the mainstream media and these press briefings in the front row
[1:02:22.840 --> 1:02:28.680]  acting up they're setting the agenda the york times what in washington post they're setting the
[1:02:28.680 --> 1:02:34.680]  agenda they want to make it a gotcha question about a senator about attorney general sessions
[1:02:34.680 --> 1:02:39.320]  that now is the next news cycle Donald Trump's got to get a hold of that we've got to say okay
[1:02:39.320 --> 1:02:45.320]  general flinn's pardoned there's no reason for a special part of prosecutor i'm in control of the
[1:02:46.200 --> 1:02:50.760]  department of justice and the fbi anybody who makes threats against the president threats of
[1:02:50.760 --> 1:02:54.840]  violence is going to get it investigated and prosecuted we're going to expand the secret
[1:02:54.840 --> 1:03:00.360]  service we're going to expand the fbi and get all the democrats out of the fbi why wasn't hillary
[1:03:00.360 --> 1:03:05.560]  investigated for the clinton foundation why wasn't what happened ever with you know weiner's
[1:03:05.560 --> 1:03:11.240]  computer all the emails pedophilia all these had a pedophilia all the rampant corruption
[1:03:11.240 --> 1:03:17.400]  salindra all the things that democrats did no prosecution because they've had their fixers
[1:03:17.400 --> 1:03:22.440]  lynch comey holder these are the people who were the criminal now here come these rats
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:27.960]  out of the sewer claiming trumps done something and they have the hearings and he's literally
[1:03:27.960 --> 1:03:31.640]  had done nothing well the whole point is they're going to blame trump no matter what everything
[1:03:31.640 --> 1:03:37.240]  that happened is going to be trumps problem the whole idea the left is constantly to obstruct
[1:03:37.240 --> 1:03:41.240]  they're not wanting to run the country they don't want to do anything positive they just
[1:03:41.240 --> 1:03:46.520]  want to destroy donald trump and if they can't get him impeached then the next thing and i've
[1:03:46.520 --> 1:03:50.760]  been saying this will be to assassinate him this is the most frightening period of time i think
[1:03:50.760 --> 1:03:57.800]  since jfk was alive and all the efforts to warn jfk he didn't listen it donald trump has got to
[1:03:57.800 --> 1:04:04.920]  listen this is serious these people do not intend to lose it's a coup d'etat deep state coup d'etat
[1:04:04.920 --> 1:04:12.040]  and he's got to clean out the cia he's got to basically start at ground zero reduce the size
[1:04:12.040 --> 1:04:18.200]  of the federal government by a half and get rid of all the people who are there who are not loyal
[1:04:18.200 --> 1:04:22.200]  to the administration now when we come back i want to ask you the question i want to open
[1:04:22.200 --> 1:04:27.240]  the phones up dr corcy i i get that's the smart thing to do there's a total mutiny in the government
[1:04:27.240 --> 1:04:32.120]  they're just ignoring him what does he do then if they start killing more people on the street
[1:04:32.120 --> 1:04:36.200]  killing more trump supporters the media keeps celebrating it by the way i was looking earlier
[1:04:36.200 --> 1:04:40.040]  we need to do a story on this there are people online on twitter celebrating the congressman
[1:04:40.040 --> 1:04:45.320]  being shot saying too bad he didn't die we're going to get that out on info wars dot com coming up

[1:04:54.760 --> 1:05:01.400]  for a reason because we're fighting for america and we tell the truth a team of global warming
[1:05:01.400 --> 1:05:05.560]  scientists were forced to cancel an arctic trip due to extreme ice conditions which highlights how the
[1:05:05.560 --> 1:05:10.280]  advocacy against manmade climate change is actually a global scheme to weaken the u.s economy the group
[1:05:10.280 --> 1:05:14.680]  of 40 scientists were on board the anilson a research ship known for its ice breaking capabilities
[1:05:14.680 --> 1:05:19.080]  but this time the ice proved too thick for the ship to break through safely right on cue one of the
[1:05:19.080 --> 1:05:23.160]  researchers blamed the ice on manmade climate change but notice how it's typically government
[1:05:23.160 --> 1:05:27.480]  funded scientists and politicians who are pushing the climate change agenda despite the fact that
[1:05:27.480 --> 1:05:31.480]  historically the biggest polluter in the world is the government you see the globalists harped
[1:05:31.480 --> 1:05:35.560]  dangers of manmade climate change which they renamed from global warming once it added them to their
[1:05:35.560 --> 1:05:41.240]  agenda to push for carbon taxes in carbon currencies that allow them to subjugate the us by impoverishing
[1:05:41.240 --> 1:05:45.080]  americans through a new technocratic form of colonialism the globalists don't want independent
[1:05:45.080 --> 1:05:49.080]  nation states with strong economies they want unelected super regional governments like the
[1:05:49.080 --> 1:05:53.560]  eu consisting of member states that are subordinate to the globalist controlled economy driven by

[1:12:41.640 --> 1:12:47.400]  trying to defend america are going to have to be concerned about security we have race riots
[1:12:47.400 --> 1:12:52.760]  we're going to see violence throughout the summer we're going to see a continual uptick and if it
[1:12:52.760 --> 1:12:58.840]  gets celebrated on twitter and other social media we've got to have the department of justice out
[1:12:58.840 --> 1:13:04.360]  there finding these people and prosecuting them these are crimes you can't advocate violence
[1:13:04.360 --> 1:13:09.800]  that's not free speech well how dare trump bring hundreds of billions of new jobs into america how
[1:13:09.800 --> 1:13:14.840]  dare trump uh boost the stock market three plus trillion how how dare him start to secure the
[1:13:14.840 --> 1:13:19.480]  border i mean these people all we're trying to do is bring back prosperity but they want to make it
[1:13:19.480 --> 1:13:27.400]  like venezuela or north korea it is just all the msm's doing whipping up everybody into this crazed
[1:13:27.400 --> 1:13:33.000]  frenzy dr corcy it's so sad well it's it's all the socialist communists look at the look at the
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:37.800]  agenda that they want to support they want to support free everything they want to support
[1:13:37.800 --> 1:13:41.720]  diversity which oh this guy that you know that just went and shot all these people to baseball game
[1:13:41.720 --> 1:13:45.720]  he was a bernie supporter he doesn't want us to own guns but he'll use the second amendment against
[1:13:45.720 --> 1:13:51.720]  us and let's get into the stichotomy none dare call a conspiracy written back in the 70s breaks
[1:13:51.720 --> 1:13:56.280]  down how the rockefeller foundation and others funded the major communist movements how they work
[1:13:56.280 --> 1:14:01.880]  with russia when the communist ran it and china after they took over there uh with one sided deals
[1:14:01.880 --> 1:14:07.240]  that's why obama went to latin america last year and said communism's actually good and then it
[1:14:07.240 --> 1:14:12.680]  worked for multinationals so communism and free market go together but he means you're in a communist
[1:14:12.680 --> 1:14:18.040]  country and then offshore free market groups exploit you it's total slavery so the elite just
[1:14:18.040 --> 1:14:22.840]  as they wrote none done their call conspiracy from the documents they're promoting communism and
[1:14:22.840 --> 1:14:30.200]  socialism because it domesticates people it dumps them down it ends the middle class then the elites
[1:14:30.200 --> 1:14:36.840]  sit offshore outside of the communist or socialist system they bring in uh this is really just feudalism
[1:14:36.840 --> 1:14:42.520]  can you explain that paradigm well it's it's very simple the whole idea of the communists are that
[1:14:42.520 --> 1:14:47.640]  you know basically they it's a lie they're this whole idea we're all going to be equal everything's
[1:14:47.640 --> 1:14:51.560]  going to be distributed everything's going to be free it's the capitalists who are stealing from you
[1:14:51.560 --> 1:14:57.720]  it's always produced mass murder and mass pop yes but why do the ultra rich then keep funding it
[1:14:57.720 --> 1:15:03.160]  because they're essentially globalists and they i understand that if there is a communist state or
[1:15:03.160 --> 1:15:08.120]  there's a globalist state they're going to be the elite at the top that's their whole plan i mean
[1:15:08.120 --> 1:15:13.080]  you don't think hillary clinton is living you know they're in a project somewhere worth billions and
[1:15:13.080 --> 1:15:19.160]  you don't think any of these globalists the actors and let's expand on that you go out to one of these
[1:15:19.160 --> 1:15:23.880]  communist marches that are now like roaches running around and there's so many of them and they
[1:15:23.880 --> 1:15:28.840]  literally black white is spanning i don't care look like they've been lobotomized look like film
[1:15:28.840 --> 1:15:34.120]  footage i've seen on pbs of middle wards or state hospitals i mean you can everybody see it for
[1:15:34.120 --> 1:15:39.400]  themselves drooling eyes pointing different directions screaming cuss words throwing fits
[1:15:39.400 --> 1:15:47.560]  urinating on themselves throwing pee on people i mean they act like lobotomized uh middle patients
[1:15:47.560 --> 1:15:53.720]  what is going on well you got to understand look look at how close if you look at hillary if you
[1:15:53.720 --> 1:15:59.800]  look at how close they thought they were they had a paris climate accord which was going to be a
[1:15:59.800 --> 1:16:04.920]  massive carbon tax they were shutting down the coal industry they were reducing america's ability
[1:16:04.920 --> 1:16:11.800]  to produce energy then we had the un on the rise we had the eu on the rise rollback brexit we're
[1:16:11.800 --> 1:16:16.120]  going to open our borders we're going to be flooded with these refugees coming in from
[1:16:16.120 --> 1:16:20.600]  islamic countries and the new numbers are in they're talking about a 250 increase in refugees
[1:16:20.600 --> 1:16:25.640]  in europe now above the six million that came in in the last four years 80 percent military
[1:16:25.640 --> 1:16:31.640]  aged men and they're planning that here and then major muslim leaders come here and bring in and
[1:16:31.640 --> 1:16:37.720]  import the refugees to your town and hillary and obama felt like they had they could touch it
[1:16:37.720 --> 1:16:42.280]  they could feel it they knew it was right here they were on the edge of it as they had one they
[1:16:42.280 --> 1:16:48.040]  were going to immediately throw out all the laws they were immediately going to put into high gear
[1:16:48.040 --> 1:16:51.240]  and first amendment was going to be gone second amendment was going to be gone
[1:16:51.240 --> 1:16:57.240]  and they were in control we'd be globalist within four years that was the plan and there's desperately
[1:16:57.240 --> 1:17:03.400]  insanely can't figure out how they lost they are continuing her entire policy
[1:17:03.400 --> 1:17:07.800]  her entire plan as if trump isn't even president and they're obstructing they don't want to they
[1:17:07.800 --> 1:17:13.880]  don't not want obama obama hates the idea that we'd make america great again they're confident
[1:17:13.880 --> 1:17:17.320]  that they can destroy because the globalists have to pick and choose winners and their whole
[1:17:17.320 --> 1:17:21.800]  global order will go down because people will want the american system we're going to go to bright
[1:17:21.800 --> 1:17:26.680]  we're going to come back and take your phone calls and then dr corcy is going to leave us

[1:17:30.120 --> 1:17:34.920]  to give his take on this is also well known actor and then we are going to continue with other guests

[1:17:40.600 --> 1:17:47.320]  for the state department as well and he can speak to that coming up but briefly ladies and gentlemen

[1:24:51.080 --> 1:24:58.520]  disturbing so the technical director of the film snowden william benning will be joining us coming
[1:24:58.520 --> 1:25:04.120]  up will also continue with your phone calls what you're witnessing is the democrats deep state
[1:25:04.120 --> 1:25:10.520]  globalist that have overthrown countless other countries preparing a violent bullying civil
[1:25:10.520 --> 1:25:18.280]  war you saw a terror attack coordinated not by isis but by cnn msnbc the democratic party
[1:25:18.840 --> 1:25:22.840]  and people that have been calling for violence and putting out the messages through plays
[1:25:22.840 --> 1:25:28.360]  and op-eds and articles saying kill the president kill his supporters paying them during the campaign
[1:25:28.360 --> 1:25:35.320]  to go out and attack people this is organized crime imagine if the you know the italian mafia was
[1:25:35.320 --> 1:25:40.040]  had tv shows everywhere saying go out and attack a certain group of people they'd all be arrested
[1:25:40.040 --> 1:25:45.240]  for organized crime or imagine if you know muslims were doing it well i guess they'd be allowed to do
[1:25:45.240 --> 1:25:49.240]  it because because muslims are above the law and they're allowed to organize attacks you know imagine
[1:25:49.240 --> 1:25:54.600]  if christians were going going out and you know say kill people they would all be arrested
[1:25:54.600 --> 1:25:58.920]  but because it's muslims and liberals they're allowed to do it dr coursey well and also
[1:25:58.920 --> 1:26:04.600]  everybody's got to realize how sophisticated this is you've got really professional techniques here
[1:26:04.600 --> 1:26:11.720]  of propaganda it starts out with lies it starts out with a russian meme that hillary made up
[1:26:11.720 --> 1:26:17.080]  in order to explain why she lost and then and then trumps a racist and trumps a nazi and his
[1:26:17.080 --> 1:26:21.480]  supporters are so first we're dehumanized then they say kill us and then the killing starts
[1:26:21.480 --> 1:26:29.000]  and the messages are being sent out by msnbc daily and and a cnn which is the hate trump hate
[1:26:29.000 --> 1:26:33.320]  trump hate trump demonize he's going to do this to you he's going to take this away
[1:26:33.320 --> 1:26:38.200]  you never thought he was going to be elected he isn't legitimate these messages resonate and they
[1:26:38.200 --> 1:26:45.240]  get then with a veneer of violence let's eliminate let's kill let's let's damage let's destroy let's
[1:26:45.240 --> 1:26:52.600]  obstruct this whole thing is a democratic far left marx's propaganda campaign and it's going to
[1:26:52.600 --> 1:26:58.920]  have to trace back into the cia got about the cia that's packed with john brennan people who are
[1:26:58.920 --> 1:27:03.960]  anti america basically fundamentally wanting the democrats agenda and that's throughout the
[1:27:03.960 --> 1:27:08.360]  administration and including in the white house that's right let's go to calls dr coursey's our

[1:29:55.960 --> 1:30:07.960]  the fake news continues in a vox pop segment about the testimony of former fbi director james
[1:30:07.960 --> 1:30:16.040]  comey msnbc was caught trying to pretend that a former obama campaign director was just a random
[1:30:16.040 --> 1:30:22.760]  woman on the street giving her opinion and the fact that he would make a very specific request
[1:30:22.760 --> 1:30:28.920]  to have everybody else leave the office so that he would be alone with comey for me speaks volumes
[1:30:28.920 --> 1:30:34.920]  well it turns out that this random woman just happened to be political strategist alma marquez
[1:30:34.920 --> 1:30:40.040]  but this is what we've all learned to expect from the establishment news media where perhaps the
[1:30:40.040 --> 1:30:47.720]  worst reputation belongs to cnn who has a long history of questionable news reporting including
[1:30:47.720 --> 1:30:54.920]  the recent staged muslim anti-terror protest where you can clearly see host becky anderson

[1:34:20.840 --> 1:34:27.640]  many lives would have been lost if not for the heroic actions of the two capital police officers
[1:34:27.640 --> 1:34:36.600]  who took down the gunman despite sustaining gunshot wounds during a very very brutal assault
[1:34:36.600 --> 1:34:47.080]  malania and i are grateful for the heroism and praying for the swift recovery of all victims
[1:34:48.680 --> 1:34:53.240]  congressman scolese is a friend ladies and gentlemen i do know that's true i know they're
[1:34:53.240 --> 1:34:57.880]  friends they've talked about it i am so blown away right now i can hardly not even do the show
[1:34:58.840 --> 1:35:01.880]  i don't mean to interrupt the president with that statement that just came out live
[1:35:01.880 --> 1:35:08.120]  i have to interrupt him they're in there pulling it off because we've got tv's with dvr's obviously
[1:35:08.120 --> 1:35:14.920]  in live time recording major news channels fake news channels like cnn i just saw it
[1:35:15.880 --> 1:35:19.720]  and david night saw it too one of our reporters and they're in there pulling it right now
[1:35:20.920 --> 1:35:27.560]  david night just tweeted at libertarian that's his twitter handle cnn just aired man on the street
[1:35:27.560 --> 1:35:34.520]  where one said i just want people to know he wasn't evil just tired of politics and i saw the clip
[1:35:35.400 --> 1:35:39.960]  wolf blitzer and them say nothing and seem to agree and you know cnn's famous for interviewing
[1:35:39.960 --> 1:35:44.680]  camera people producers and fakes they just got caught recently doing it again so does msnbc
[1:35:44.680 --> 1:35:49.720]  it looked totally staged we're getting the video right now where he's like he was an evil man he
[1:35:49.720 --> 1:35:57.960]  was just tired of these of these policies is what i heard and cnn cuts back i mean cnn ladies and
[1:35:57.960 --> 1:36:06.280]  gentlemen is so disgusting so i'm gonna have our guest pop in that wasn't me on for a full hour
[1:36:06.280 --> 1:36:09.480]  but obviously because of breaking news he isn't i want to invite him back up in the next week
[1:36:10.840 --> 1:36:15.560]  because we have this initiative here of trying to get these great people that are running for
[1:36:15.560 --> 1:36:20.040]  congress or running for governor or running for legislature on the show at least a few times a
[1:36:20.040 --> 1:36:26.040]  week to continue the american revolution to try to restore the republic and tonio sabato jr
[1:36:26.040 --> 1:36:31.800]  obviously nobody really needs me to give you an introduction to him uh he's uh one of the hottest
[1:36:31.800 --> 1:36:38.360]  commodities uh to come on daytime television top tv shows movies you name it uh he's a calvin
[1:36:38.360 --> 1:36:43.560]  climb model i'm not gonna go over at all but what really matters is he's running for congress
[1:36:43.560 --> 1:36:49.000]  he's a patriot and to do that when you're big in hollywood and a you know major celebrity and
[1:36:49.000 --> 1:36:57.000]  you know alist tv movies you name it to to do that is basically like taking cyanide for your
[1:36:57.000 --> 1:37:03.720]  career i mean it takes a lot of courage conservatives and libertarians have to meet in secret to even
[1:37:03.720 --> 1:37:12.280]  you know talk about ideas uh he was also blacklisted in hollywood uh for speaking um out and endorsing
[1:37:12.280 --> 1:37:17.720]  trump so he's a real hero so he's with us for the rest of the hour and then i really want to invite
[1:37:17.720 --> 1:37:23.800]  him up for a full hour because he's such an interesting and well-spoken person uh also you can uh
[1:37:23.800 --> 1:37:30.280]  vote antonio dot com on may 8 2017 sabato filed paperwork with the federal election commission

[1:38:08.600 --> 1:38:14.040]  me i mean what a group of bullies and i love what kurt russell said he said i'm not a republican
[1:38:14.040 --> 1:38:19.320]  or democrat i just like free market america and why can't i do that and not get blacklisted
[1:38:19.320 --> 1:38:23.160]  he i guess he's so big they've they've had trouble blacklisting him but you know they're
[1:38:23.160 --> 1:38:28.600]  still trying so is this america or isn't antonio sabato junior so good to have you on with us

[1:38:43.880 --> 1:38:50.200]  such a uh an incredible time uh you know they were they were ready to uh to practice this morning
[1:38:50.200 --> 1:38:56.520]  play softball enjoy their day and then the entire day was ruined because of this individual we live
[1:38:56.520 --> 1:39:01.720]  in crazy times alex and we need to stand up for our country for the freedom of our country and uh
[1:39:02.280 --> 1:39:07.800]  it's this it's a disgrace what's going on in the media how they publicized this how to publicize
[1:39:07.800 --> 1:39:13.720]  any of these events they make it about uh lies and they continue to do that uh and uh you know
[1:39:13.720 --> 1:39:18.200]  basically that's why i'm running for congress because i want to make a difference i want to make a
[1:39:18.200 --> 1:39:23.560]  change uh and i'm going to fight for what is right because i love this country so much alex
[1:39:23.560 --> 1:39:26.680]  what's wild for me is
[1:39:29.400 --> 1:39:33.240]  gabby giffords gets shot by a guy that was a drug head and registered democrat
[1:39:33.800 --> 1:39:38.120]  and they blame conservatives and libertarians and gun owners for years but they're not even
[1:39:38.120 --> 1:39:42.760]  apologizing on cnn or all these other channels that called for trump's death all these people
[1:39:42.760 --> 1:39:47.400]  that push violence said he should die on the newspapers we've all seen it the plays the movies
[1:39:47.400 --> 1:39:52.040]  everywhere and now we're getting the clip we should have it soon they have a man on the street
[1:39:52.040 --> 1:39:57.320]  looks totally staged saying this man wasn't evil he was just tired of the policies and so they're
[1:39:57.320 --> 1:40:01.880]  even and then no one said no that's a terrible viewer that's crazy they're actually trying to push
[1:40:01.880 --> 1:40:09.480]  the idea that killing people is okay i mean these people are so whacked out yeah they're they're
[1:40:09.480 --> 1:40:14.680]  whacked out alex and uh they're they're completely out of their minds and to support this and always
[1:40:14.680 --> 1:40:20.040]  blame guns and guns guns don't shoot themselves people have to pull the trigger you know i am
[1:40:20.040 --> 1:40:26.280]  for the second amendment i'm a ccw holder i i work with law enforcement i go to the shooting range
[1:40:26.280 --> 1:40:31.480]  i've done my testing i've done it this is not about guns this is about people being uh uh
[1:40:32.200 --> 1:40:38.280]  pulled left and right and push to do these kinds of things because violence is being on the on a
[1:40:38.280 --> 1:40:44.520]  media on social media on cnn like you were saying on a daily basis they're not reporting the truth
[1:40:44.520 --> 1:40:51.240]  they were putting lies and um and it's hypocrisy to the max level i mean this is communism this is
[1:40:51.240 --> 1:40:57.480]  socialism this is all the things that that i hate personally uh we need to stand up for this this is
[1:40:57.480 --> 1:41:02.840]  wrong and uh the american people know what's better i mean that's what we voted for our president
[1:41:02.840 --> 1:41:07.320]  trump to be elected it's because we wanted a man i mean look at look at this man this man
[1:41:07.320 --> 1:41:11.720]  by the way happy birthday mr president um it's your birthday and it's kind of sad that on your
[1:41:11.720 --> 1:41:18.840]  birthday these kinds of things are happening but this man left 11 billion dollars he left his fame
[1:41:18.840 --> 1:41:24.520]  to be ridiculed on a daily basis because he loves this country we finally have a president who's
[1:41:24.520 --> 1:41:30.200]  standing out for the american people who's fighting for what is right um and this is this is uh this
[1:41:30.200 --> 1:41:34.840]  is crazy what we've seen on daily basis now let's talk about your courage i mean you're not stupid
[1:41:34.840 --> 1:41:42.040]  you're a smart guy top tv host huge movies a list making tons of money what did you see in america
[1:41:42.040 --> 1:41:47.000]  that made you you know being big in hollywood you know obviously knowing that this would like
[1:41:47.000 --> 1:41:52.120]  james wood said basically end his top career what made you do that to come out and support trump
[1:41:52.760 --> 1:41:58.600]  when the last eight years uh ten years actually uh what i've seen uh from our last president
[1:41:58.600 --> 1:42:03.880]  is something that i didn't agree with and uh i mean we can't say that about our president now
[1:42:03.880 --> 1:42:08.120]  because he just started maybe eight years down the line we could look back and go okay this is
[1:42:08.120 --> 1:42:12.280]  what it should have been done or maybe the president should have done this better but in the last ten
[1:42:12.280 --> 1:42:18.440]  years uh you know i i guess it's common sense you know that the lack of enthusiasm for this country
[1:42:19.320 --> 1:42:23.960]  the lack of enthusiasm for our law enforcement for our military for our veterans what i've seen
[1:42:23.960 --> 1:42:29.320]  in the last um not a last president and i just wanted to step up and express my opinion about
[1:42:29.320 --> 1:42:35.160]  and i was so proud of finally having a candidate who i believed was going to win and he did win
[1:42:35.800 --> 1:42:41.480]  who loved this country more than his own career and and everything else and uh i respected that
[1:42:41.480 --> 1:42:46.120]  and so i stood up and so you did the exact same thing he did let's let's talk about
[1:42:46.120 --> 1:42:50.360]  what happened to you and again people think oh this intimidates folks know it's the opposite
[1:42:50.360 --> 1:42:55.080]  we all need to do with antonio sabato junior and donald trump did and now trump three trillion
[1:42:55.080 --> 1:43:01.480]  the stock market hundreds of billions of new jobs uh isis being crushed uh just all this great stuff
[1:43:01.480 --> 1:43:06.040]  happening killing tpp that was unelected the secret pulling out of the paris climate deal
[1:43:06.040 --> 1:43:10.280]  that was only on europe in the u.s those are great things alex those are really good things the people
[1:43:10.280 --> 1:43:14.200]  don't want to talk about that they're still against this president i'll tell you the reason why
[1:43:14.200 --> 1:43:19.000]  they're still against him it's because they fear him because they can't control this man and because
[1:43:19.000 --> 1:43:23.480]  they can't control him they can't give him money they're gonna they're gonna continue to do this
[1:43:23.480 --> 1:43:29.320]  and ridicule this man on a daily basis and spread lies now i spoke for him i spoke about him and i
[1:43:29.320 --> 1:43:34.200]  supported him and i felt that you know after this i just spoke my mind we have the right to do that
[1:43:34.200 --> 1:43:40.200]  in this country but after that hollywood is completely just put me on the sideline uh i lost many jobs
[1:43:40.760 --> 1:43:47.000]  uh people have been so cruel and the nasty that i've seen on social media toward me without even
[1:43:47.000 --> 1:43:52.440]  knowing me because i supported this president it's been incredible i've never seen anything like this
[1:43:52.440 --> 1:43:56.520]  it's just pure evil but you're not giving up you're running for congress and i got to say
[1:43:56.520 --> 1:44:00.920]  i've seen you in movies i've seen you in interviews i always like i've seen you in television
[1:44:00.920 --> 1:44:05.000]  and i've always thought man that guy's really cool you you you're i mean you're gonna make a great
[1:44:05.000 --> 1:44:09.080]  congressman and i think you could end up being president down the road that'll really show these
[1:44:09.080 --> 1:44:15.480]  people and no seriously so what do we do to get you into congress well you have to go to vote in
[1:44:15.480 --> 1:44:21.000]  tony dot com alex uh you know it running for anything in the political world you need to raise
[1:44:21.000 --> 1:44:27.480]  money as soon as i'm able to raise as much money as possible i have a shot at this uh and so the
[1:44:27.480 --> 1:44:32.920]  next i would say six to eight months is about raising money so go to vote in tony dot com
[1:44:32.920 --> 1:44:37.960]  and you know give a dollar give 50 cents give ten dollars oh the middle class and the people better
[1:44:37.960 --> 1:44:43.000]  give a lot more than that we're in a war it's time people to get serious yeah people you have
[1:44:43.000 --> 1:44:46.440]  two thousand dollars what's the max thing you have two thousand a piece yeah i think it's
[1:44:46.440 --> 1:44:54.040]  2700 the max but like i said i you know i appreciate anything that you can do um the more the better
[1:44:54.040 --> 1:44:59.640]  well i'm giving 2700 i'm giving it 2700 today and right now during the break i'm gonna give
[1:44:59.640 --> 1:45:04.040]  my credit card to one of the crew fill out the form do it because we're in a war folks and people
[1:45:04.040 --> 1:45:08.760]  that have courage like antonio sabato junior think about it making millions of dollars a year
[1:45:08.760 --> 1:45:14.120]  top tv host in big movies knowing they'd come after him knowing they'd try to shut him down
[1:45:14.120 --> 1:45:19.000]  it takes a lot of courage i could care less about hollywood stars if they don't have courage then
[1:45:19.000 --> 1:45:24.680]  they're just actors but this guy is on the front lines literally at a critical time for this country
[1:45:24.680 --> 1:45:31.640]  in the world put it where you know his money where his mouth is that right there is the bona fides for
[1:45:31.640 --> 1:45:36.920]  me to back this guy for congress and all of you should donate right now again folks you to go
[1:45:36.920 --> 1:45:41.640]  to the website vote antonio dot com how else can they support you if somebody doesn't even have
[1:45:41.640 --> 1:45:47.320]  ten dollars you know obviously they got a family out in california call in to talk radio call in
[1:45:47.320 --> 1:45:51.880]  the sea span yeah i think just spreading the word go to my twitter account and tony sabato
[1:45:51.880 --> 1:45:56.360]  junior and just spread the word about going to vote antonio dot com like i said this is about
[1:45:56.360 --> 1:46:01.160]  just spreading the word we have 18 months that are going to go really fast we need to get inside
[1:46:01.160 --> 1:46:07.080]  this the sea because you know california as you know i mean we're short on republican congressman
[1:46:07.080 --> 1:46:12.760]  and congresswomen so uh one district at a time and uh you know i want to fight for the veterans i
[1:46:12.760 --> 1:46:17.080]  want to fight for a second amendment i want to fight for illegal immigration i mean we spend
[1:46:17.080 --> 1:46:22.440]  a hundred billion dollars almost a hundred billion on illegal immigration but ten billion dollars would
[1:46:22.440 --> 1:46:27.800]  be to to to build this wall you know and then so i think that uh i want to fight for this thing i
[1:46:27.800 --> 1:46:32.200]  want to fight for this because i love this nation is giving me so much and i'm going to keep fighting
[1:46:32.200 --> 1:46:37.080]  i'm not afraid of these guys i'm not afraid of them so just just so you know out there whoever's
[1:46:37.080 --> 1:46:42.600]  watching this i'm here to fight for the american people well it's a war and when we get somebody
[1:46:42.600 --> 1:46:47.000]  as good as you run for congress that i think has such great prospects compared to the mummy
[1:46:47.000 --> 1:46:50.280]  uh that you're running against i mean i think people get behind you you're going to win but
[1:46:50.280 --> 1:46:53.720]  regardless you're going to be in those debates you're going to be on tv you're going to be
[1:46:53.720 --> 1:46:58.280]  injecting real ideas uh and and not laying down you know after they've tried to destroy you
[1:46:58.280 --> 1:47:04.680]  this is this is so exciting uh vote antonio.com uh now let's go ahead and play for tv viewers
[1:47:04.680 --> 1:47:10.360]  and radio listeners this is just what i saw during a break okay we just grabbed it off the dvr
[1:47:10.920 --> 1:47:15.240]  of cnn who's famous for interviewing fake people claiming their man on the street but even if it
[1:47:15.240 --> 1:47:21.880]  was a real person then the the general public thinks oh this person wasn't evil he was just
[1:47:21.880 --> 1:47:27.640]  tired of the policies or politics but again if a conservative had gone and shot democrats
[1:47:27.640 --> 1:47:33.240]  it would be the end of the world it shows how warped they've hyped themselves into this
[1:47:33.240 --> 1:47:39.240]  Nazi like i don't know what you call it communist like a cult like fervor uh here's the shocking
[1:47:39.240 --> 1:47:46.200]  clip uh standby art now we're just getting uh some uh some uh taped in of an acquaintance of
[1:47:46.200 --> 1:47:53.080]  james hodgkinson the 66 year old shooter uh describing some of his political perhaps motivations
[1:47:53.080 --> 1:48:01.240]  listen to this i just want to let people know that he wasn't evil that he was i guess tired of some
[1:48:01.240 --> 1:48:07.320]  of the politics are going on that's what we just heard perhaps he wasn't evil just tired of the
[1:48:07.320 --> 1:48:14.600]  politics that's going on antonio i have no words to say about things like this i mean people have
[1:48:14.600 --> 1:48:19.800]  no guts and glory anymore to stand up for what is right to stand up for what is right and truthful
[1:48:19.800 --> 1:48:25.800]  and honest this guy was pure evil who plans to get out of their home with a loaded machine gun
[1:48:25.800 --> 1:48:32.440]  probably a semi-automatic rifle that he wants to ban for us and and he loads magazines on purpose
[1:48:32.440 --> 1:48:40.040]  to to kill and to traumatize and to to to destroy people's lives and so we need to talk about that
[1:48:40.040 --> 1:48:45.880]  this man was pure evil and he was terrorizing people and he did and he succeeded but now we
[1:48:45.880 --> 1:48:51.480]  got to stand up for that and cnn how can you actually say things like this and support this
[1:48:51.480 --> 1:48:56.440]  i i don't believe it i just can't exactly again antonio sabata jr is our guest vote antonio
[1:48:56.440 --> 1:49:02.360]  dot com running for congress there in uh california a lot of courage ladies and gentlemen i'm not
[1:49:02.360 --> 1:49:07.160]  calling for this but i want to be clear if someone walks up to wolf blitzer when he is doing a live
[1:49:07.160 --> 1:49:12.040]  event on the street and shoots a bunch of bullets into him and wounds him or kills him or paralyzes
[1:49:12.040 --> 1:49:18.520]  him do we then go well it wasn't evil it was just a political statement i mean don't these democrats
[1:49:18.520 --> 1:49:24.200]  yet they're taking the restraint of patriots and christians and libertarians and constitutionalists
[1:49:24.200 --> 1:49:28.680]  and conservatives as weakness it's not we've got the military the police everybody else if they
[1:49:28.680 --> 1:49:33.800]  really start a war with us i mean they're opening the door saying it's okay to kill people that's
[1:49:33.800 --> 1:49:38.360]  basically what wolf blitzer wolf blitzer did not qualify that and say well obviously we don't agree
[1:49:38.360 --> 1:49:43.800]  with that here i mean if i if i had somebody on like that who they sought out and i had them say
[1:49:43.800 --> 1:49:49.080]  that and i didn't say i don't agree with that i would be crucified you would be crucified
[1:49:49.080 --> 1:49:54.600]  trump would be crucified what is wrong with these people i don't know alex i really don't understand
[1:49:54.600 --> 1:49:59.320]  it that's what we need to stick together we need to spread kindness and love but we also have to
[1:49:59.320 --> 1:50:04.440]  have common sense and something is wrong and really really wrong we have to stand up for that
[1:50:04.440 --> 1:50:10.440]  and the and the liberal media they need to they need to change this because they're doing something
[1:50:10.440 --> 1:50:15.080]  just as bad as these people because they're promoting it and they're not going against it
[1:50:15.080 --> 1:50:19.240]  they're not standing up for what is right how do they sleep at night i have no idea they get paid
[1:50:19.240 --> 1:50:26.600]  to report the news not to stand and political i you know and take stands because every single day
[1:50:26.600 --> 1:50:31.320]  i watch this you know and i tend to watch because i want to see what the what the other side is doing
[1:50:31.320 --> 1:50:36.040]  in black cnn and they're reporting everything everything they reported on on our president
[1:50:36.040 --> 1:50:41.080]  is against him from oh it's all upside down it's it's all lies it's it's incredible i mean you
[1:50:41.080 --> 1:50:46.040]  know come he falls on his face come he had a great day uh sessions dominate sessions had a bad day i
[1:50:46.040 --> 1:50:51.560]  mean these are anti-freedom creeps they're such villains i can't even believe it i mean mainstream

[2:00:47.880 --> 2:00:52.680]  police officers another one a lobbyist while while they were playing a republican baseball game
[2:00:52.680 --> 2:00:57.880]  and wolf blitzer doesn't come back and say well obviously the you know killing people is not
[2:00:57.880 --> 2:01:03.320]  political and obviously you know we don't agree with that here at cnn he pushed it they clearly
[2:01:03.320 --> 2:01:08.120]  we're in news we know what it looks like cnn's been caught so many times with staged interviews
[2:01:08.120 --> 2:01:14.200]  this was cnn's statement cnn is proud of what they just did they got you know kathy you know
[2:01:14.200 --> 2:01:18.440]  working for him that's running around kathy griffin saying cut the president's head off
[2:01:18.440 --> 2:01:24.360]  you've got all these other reporters saying kill the president will it be political if somebody
[2:01:24.360 --> 2:01:29.320]  sees wolf blitzer and walks up and sprays bullets into him and says hey i'm not evil wolf i just
[2:01:29.320 --> 2:01:32.840]  killed you deader than a hammer i mean i don't want to kill wolf blitzer i'm not saying that
[2:01:32.840 --> 2:01:37.880]  there's such liars they'll say i did uh david night i'm saying don't you people get it you're
[2:01:37.880 --> 2:01:43.400]  trying to start a civil war with people you're taking our kindness for weakness do you understand
[2:01:43.400 --> 2:01:50.120]  the american people will kill all of you you understand we are killing machines you fools go
[2:01:50.120 --> 2:01:55.480]  ahead we know alex that the question is do they have a duty to say something about that they cut
[2:01:55.480 --> 2:01:59.320]  this out as an excerpt they said we've got a clip here from somebody who knew him and the guy comes
[2:01:59.320 --> 2:02:03.160]  out we'll play the clip for you here in just a second the guy says uh i just want people to know
[2:02:03.160 --> 2:02:07.320]  he's not evil he's just tired of the politics and they come back and wolf blitzer goes okay well
[2:02:07.320 --> 2:02:12.120]  let's go on now if you are the reporter there wouldn't you want some clarification about that
[2:02:12.120 --> 2:02:17.240]  why is that not evil no i'd say excuse me i'd say excuse me yeah why wouldn't wolf say something
[2:02:17.240 --> 2:02:22.520]  about that doesn't he have a duty to say i'm sorry that is evil that is not politics you should have
[2:02:22.520 --> 2:02:27.640]  said none of us are promoting violence here this is horrible if you or i did that it'd be career
[2:02:27.640 --> 2:02:31.560]  rending yes and i would like to know as a reporter on the scene who got that interview with that guy
[2:02:31.560 --> 2:02:37.720]  i would ask him what do you mean by that give me some clarification no no interest in the democrats
[2:02:37.720 --> 2:02:41.320]  cut it right there put it out there on air the tweets are all over m4s.com they're tweeting at
[2:02:41.320 --> 2:02:46.040]  mingle and we're gonna get you next you bastard i mean they're celebrating this but they all hate
[2:02:46.040 --> 2:02:51.080]  guns they don't know how to use them but i could shoot bullseye at 400 yards dumbass i mean they
[2:02:51.080 --> 2:02:55.160]  have no idea who they're messing with the funny thing is just before that clip we're laughing
[2:02:55.160 --> 2:02:59.720]  cj is laughing about it we're all back there the cnn reporter says yeah he was there with an m1 or
[2:02:59.720 --> 2:03:05.560]  something it's like an m1 they don't even they don't know anything at all about firearms and this is
[2:03:05.560 --> 2:03:09.720]  a guy but they dream like the communists we were showing earlier this is from austin this weekend
[2:03:09.720 --> 2:03:15.160]  with their fingers on their triggers almost aiming guns at cops if i was one of those cops
[2:03:15.160 --> 2:03:20.600]  i mean this is insane yeah it absolutely is insane but we have to look at this we have to say at
[2:03:20.600 --> 2:03:24.920]  what point and this is what i talked about last night i started i said you know what we're seeing
[2:03:24.920 --> 2:03:29.960]  here in the senate the testimony here what we're seeing is a political assassination metaphorically
[2:03:29.960 --> 2:03:35.160]  but they're also acting it out at the same time in new york at the theater in the park and so what
[2:03:35.160 --> 2:03:38.600]  they're doing is they're acting out that political assassination they get a standing ovation from
[2:03:38.600 --> 2:03:42.920]  alec ball went all the broadway crowd is just sick of these people and and that is the difference
[2:03:42.920 --> 2:03:47.560]  alex i think you know we have a discussion about where is the line on the first amendment
[2:03:47.560 --> 2:03:52.920]  i tweeted out i said you can't cry fire in a crowded theater and you can't get up in front of the
[2:03:52.920 --> 2:03:58.440]  theater because you're an actor and tell people to fire enemies look at these look at these these
[2:03:58.440 --> 2:04:04.040]  communists with with axe handles hitting cops and the cops only bump them away i would beat their
[2:04:04.040 --> 2:04:09.000]  brains out man they're out there with a deadly weapon attacking peaceful protesters protesting
[2:04:09.000 --> 2:04:13.800]  sharia law i want my first amendment protected or what are you going to do if i really stand up to
[2:04:13.800 --> 2:04:18.120]  these people and i'm not bragging man you hit me with an axe club i'm going to take it away from
[2:04:18.120 --> 2:04:21.960]  you and i'm going to stick it you know where well see this whole thing is a continuum alex because
[2:04:21.960 --> 2:04:26.840]  they have cnn is out there they won't call things like what kathy griffin did they won't call that
[2:04:26.840 --> 2:04:31.080]  evil they won't call this other stuff incitement and so when you have a guy who no no she whines
[2:04:31.080 --> 2:04:36.360]  about it she's a victim yeah yeah yeah yeah he destroyed me he broke me he broke me that's what
[2:04:36.360 --> 2:04:41.000]  she said oh listen dr corcy's in there you're hot to go i don't mind the competition against the
[2:04:41.000 --> 2:04:44.680]  show because it's competition against the globalist you guys ought to go in the other studio or
[2:04:44.680 --> 2:04:49.240]  somewhere and just fire up do a live feed right now sure i say just let them have it brother
[2:04:49.240 --> 2:04:53.080]  absolutely corcy's vector finishing his lunch eating some food just just attack just everybody

[2:05:04.040 --> 2:05:08.920]  for violence are finally working majority whip representative steve scolese out of louisiana
[2:05:08.920 --> 2:05:13.320]  was shot this morning along with several other aides and capital guards and already there are
[2:05:13.320 --> 2:05:16.920]  some amazing quotes coming out of the situation representative ran paul said it would have been
[2:05:16.920 --> 2:05:22.040]  a massacre had there not been good guys with guns representative ron desantis recounted an odd
[2:05:22.040 --> 2:05:25.480]  encounter he had as he was leaving the field just before the shooting there's a guy that walked up
[2:05:25.480 --> 2:05:29.320]  to us and asked whether it was the republicans or democrats out there and it was just a little odd
[2:05:29.320 --> 2:05:33.080]  desantis told fox one of the most harrowing accounts is from representative mo brooks who
[2:05:33.080 --> 2:05:37.080]  talks about taking refuge inside the dugout applying tourniquets to another injured person
[2:05:37.080 --> 2:05:40.360]  and then running out to the field to help representatives glee supply pressure to his
[2:05:40.360 --> 2:05:44.920]  wound but here is one of the most important things he said it's not easy when you see people around
[2:05:44.920 --> 2:05:48.360]  you being shot and you don't have a weapon yourself now democrats are going to come out of the
[2:05:48.360 --> 2:05:52.600]  woodwork and call for more gun control but at this time we should not be relinquishing any of our
[2:05:52.600 --> 2:05:56.920]  rights especially in this climate of violence that is all being sown by the democrats and leftists

[2:08:44.360 --> 2:08:46.120]  you
[2:08:57.240 --> 2:09:00.120]  william benning at his father's grave
[2:09:04.520 --> 2:09:05.720]  this is my father's grave
[2:09:05.720 --> 2:09:16.200]  i one time i asked him i said uh in your service in wartime uh how many men did you kill
[2:09:16.920 --> 2:09:23.000]  and he said maybe one so but that's all he said he didn't really talk about it
[2:09:27.800 --> 2:09:33.000]  i think that was pretty typical of world war two veterans they did what they had to do and they
[2:09:33.000 --> 2:09:37.080]  didn't really think that that was anything different than anyone else did in world war two
[2:09:40.200 --> 2:09:42.840]  nobody thought they were heroes they just thought they did their duty
[2:09:45.800 --> 2:09:50.600]  one of the worst things about war is the those who started force others to be as vicious as they
[2:09:50.600 --> 2:09:55.880]  are to stop it that's what i'm sure he was feeling he just didn't want to talk about having to do
[2:09:55.880 --> 2:10:03.560]  what he had to do when in the war one of the main reasons we get into war is by mistakes by
[2:10:03.560 --> 2:10:08.440]  leadership because they're informed incorrectly or they're uninformed about the events you know
[2:10:08.440 --> 2:10:13.800]  totally so um the the principle i thought that i was working under was to make sure that the
[2:10:13.800 --> 2:10:19.640]  information that i could arrive at through the work i did uh was informative to leadership so
[2:10:19.640 --> 2:10:25.480]  they didn't make mistakes powerful film i'm going to show this film to my children this weekend we
[2:10:25.480 --> 2:10:33.800]  just got it in it's amazing a good american stunning and deeply disturbing newsweek called it
[2:10:34.360 --> 2:10:39.080]  extraordinary story of an extraordinary spy william benning one of the top mathematicians in
[2:10:39.080 --> 2:10:43.880]  modern history one of the men who engineered much of what the nsa is today but not to spy on
[2:10:43.880 --> 2:10:47.640]  the american people but to protect the nation someone who tried to stop the illegal spying and
[2:10:47.640 --> 2:10:53.160]  was swat teamed for it he's now been of course vindicated and we have the filmmaker with us
[2:10:53.160 --> 2:10:58.600]  as well he of course was the main technical advisor on snowden the big blockbuster film
[2:10:58.600 --> 2:11:05.400]  that was so powerful uh that oliver stone put out and see to me oliver stone is a real liberal
[2:11:06.600 --> 2:11:13.160]  he's against ices he's against war with russia he's against bankrupt in the country and i i take
[2:11:13.160 --> 2:11:16.760]  some of it like william benning i would call him liberal or conservative he's just an american
[2:11:16.760 --> 2:11:23.560]  patriot and the truth is trump liked the nsa spying before now he doesn't like it because he
[2:11:23.560 --> 2:11:28.280]  realizes he's being used against him and it's being used against americans and tens of thousands
[2:11:28.280 --> 2:11:35.160]  of americans we now know where he legally targeted by obama and trump was spied on
[2:11:36.600 --> 2:11:41.080]  and they tried to lie about that so this is bipartisan this affects no matter what color
[2:11:41.080 --> 2:11:47.720]  you are where you came from this is the giant spy grid and it's such a powerful film a good american
[2:11:47.720 --> 2:11:52.680]  this is something that brings us all together under our first amendment under our fourth amendment
[2:11:53.880 --> 2:11:57.880]  and just understanding the big corporations that have these spy grids that are hooked into the
[2:11:57.880 --> 2:12:03.080]  nsa they're like the new gods and they've done it by violating all of our rights and they're
[2:12:03.080 --> 2:12:08.520]  taking over our world and ending competition this is the big threat and this is the film i think
[2:12:08.520 --> 2:12:13.000]  i think informationally it's even better than snowden which was excellent i couldn't believe
[2:12:13.000 --> 2:12:17.240]  that hollywood would let something that good come out that's one of the only good things i've seen
[2:12:17.240 --> 2:12:21.080]  that actually told the truth politically from hollywood in years from the left or the right
[2:12:22.040 --> 2:12:26.680]  and so the film is a good america i don't mean to gush too much about this but we've got several
[2:12:26.680 --> 2:12:32.680]  other clips my father's grave everything is human behavior the graph the maze with william benning
[2:12:32.680 --> 2:12:38.840]  the former technical director of the national security agency and of course the filmmaker
[2:12:39.640 --> 2:12:46.040]  we're going to have on with us for the next 45 minutes or so uh as well this is quite a time
[2:12:46.040 --> 2:12:53.640]  to be alive frederick mozer uh blue and green dot info uh is his uh film site and he's he's an
[2:12:53.640 --> 2:12:58.600]  amazing filmmaker in his own right i was already aware of his work uh before before i knew that
[2:12:58.600 --> 2:13:02.600]  about a year ago or so that that that he was working or year and a half ago time flies william
[2:13:02.600 --> 2:13:06.920]  benning came to town and had just been just been interviewed for this film but now it's out
[2:13:06.920 --> 2:13:11.240]  frederick mozer will be joining us but i wanted to go to uh they're both here with us right now
[2:13:11.240 --> 2:13:16.280]  just to talk to william benning do you not feel vindicated that your swat teamed you know more
[2:13:16.280 --> 2:13:21.320]  than a decade ago for talking to congress secretly following your oath to expose illegal spying
[2:13:21.320 --> 2:13:26.520]  everything you talked about and warned about vindicated by snowden vindicated by wiki leaks
[2:13:26.520 --> 2:13:33.320]  but now just out in the open in spades uh but then we learned the president himself and congress
[2:13:33.320 --> 2:13:38.520]  has fallen prey to this deep state so everything you talked about word for word now
[2:13:38.520 --> 2:13:46.920]  emblazoned uh what's it like william benning well alex i just think it's uh it's rather
[2:13:46.920 --> 2:13:51.080]  sad that it's taken this long to come out but it's also very disturbing that we don't have
[2:13:51.080 --> 2:13:58.280]  a lot of people uh standing up to oppose this you know most of them are acquiescing to it
[2:13:58.280 --> 2:14:02.680]  especially those in congress they should be outraged because they're being spied on too
[2:14:04.760 --> 2:14:07.720]  incredible you're the expert here and i want to go to the director as well and talk about this
[2:14:07.720 --> 2:14:13.560]  amazing film uh that is so important but just looking at the world today and stuff i mentioned
[2:14:13.560 --> 2:14:23.400]  what what's your expert take on that william uh mine oh i thought you were asking fritz well i i
[2:14:23.400 --> 2:14:27.640]  think uh i think fritz did an excellent job on the whole movie and i think it's brought out the
[2:14:27.640 --> 2:14:33.400]  points that are necessary for people to understand i just i just hope that uh more people can see it
[2:14:33.400 --> 2:14:38.200]  so that so that they'll begin to understand the technology behind it and understand what's what's
[2:14:38.200 --> 2:14:45.400]  possible and what the threat really is here but i always go back and uh and and refer to uh uh uh
[2:14:47.240 --> 2:14:55.160]  a former east german lieutenant colonel uh who uh in the stasi who had said of the nsa spying program
[2:14:56.040 --> 2:15:02.600]  this would have would have been a dream come true for us so that's that that really should
[2:15:02.600 --> 2:15:06.680]  tell you what this is all about it's about spying on everybody in control of everybody
[2:15:06.680 --> 2:15:11.800]  and and making sure that people line up to do what central government wants them to do and
[2:15:11.800 --> 2:15:17.880]  this is contrary to what our entire constitution was set in place to to to ensure it does not happen
[2:15:17.880 --> 2:15:21.720]  and a lot of people say well nothing to hide well that's like posting that you're out of town and
[2:15:21.720 --> 2:15:26.520]  where you live on facebook and then thieves rob your house we have blinds not because we're hiding
[2:15:26.520 --> 2:15:31.240]  something but because we have privacy and isn't privacy historically the essence of what free
[2:15:31.240 --> 2:15:36.680]  peoples have so i want to get into the film but this film years in the making is now the life
[2:15:36.680 --> 2:15:43.240]  we're living it's now vindicated as you are by everything it breaks down uh you in real time
[2:15:43.240 --> 2:15:49.000]  it's it's it's beyond evergreen is what i'm saying and the revelation that certain elites
[2:15:49.000 --> 2:15:55.240]  have omnipresent access to information and us mere mortals are here uh i mean this is the ultimate
[2:15:55.240 --> 2:16:00.680]  discrimination as well they don't just steal our data they then collate it and use it against us
[2:16:00.680 --> 2:16:08.120]  and market it and predict the future i mean this is this is promethean fire but we pay for the fire
[2:16:08.120 --> 2:16:14.200]  but we don't even get the benefits of it that's that's right and for what's going on today right
[2:16:14.200 --> 2:16:18.920]  now with comey and and euler i mean these are two guys who were at the center of this spying
[2:16:18.920 --> 2:16:23.240]  they were they were using this data with the fbi and the department of justice all along and they
[2:16:23.240 --> 2:16:27.800]  were the one they were the ones who were were advocates for it in internally in the government
[2:16:27.800 --> 2:16:33.320]  so i you know they're that's like the criminals going after other criminals exactly i'm gonna go
[2:16:33.320 --> 2:16:36.520]  to the director here for a moment uh and then we're gonna come back to you after a break but
[2:16:36.520 --> 2:16:42.680]  that's exactly where i wanted to go i'm watching comey and i'm watching moeller who openly were
[2:16:42.680 --> 2:16:48.120]  involved in all this illegal spying i'm watching hayden running at all like he's a good guy and
[2:16:48.120 --> 2:16:53.560]  that and that trump's bad and i'm not even here defending trump the point is it's just bizarre
[2:16:53.560 --> 2:16:58.440]  to realize what these guys are involved in people have to see the film for themselves but
[2:16:58.440 --> 2:17:04.920]  frederick mozer filmmaker blue and green dot info we're selling the film at info wars store info
[2:17:04.920 --> 2:17:10.280]  wars store dot com but whatever you do folks you need to get this out to libraries you need to show
[2:17:10.280 --> 2:17:14.920]  it to students you need to this is powerful so frederick congratulations on what you've done
[2:17:14.920 --> 2:17:21.080]  here it's amazing uh but how did you get into this and just how has this changed your life
[2:17:21.080 --> 2:17:28.360]  delving into this well there is a long version of that and the short version of that the short
[2:17:28.360 --> 2:17:34.840]  version is wiki leaks actually got me to become interested in what is going on in the digital
[2:17:34.840 --> 2:17:40.440]  realm and i had a story in preparation that was already dealing with surveillance
[2:17:42.040 --> 2:17:48.120]  but then snowden came along and showed us that the magnitude of surveillance was just huge
[2:17:48.120 --> 2:17:52.760]  and way bigger than what we had come across and so it was also clear that laura poitras
[2:17:52.760 --> 2:17:57.640]  inkling greenwald would get the snow the snowden story out and also be show the panorama of
[2:17:57.640 --> 2:18:04.360]  surveillance and it was going on but my academic background is uh i have a degree in contemporary
[2:18:04.360 --> 2:18:12.760]  history and so i was interested how the hell did we get there and so i was looking for a story of
[2:18:12.760 --> 2:18:20.280]  a person you know a personal story uh which could be emotional and powerful enough to attract
[2:18:20.280 --> 2:18:25.160]  the interest of people who are not genuinely interested in surveillance as such but just in
[2:18:25.160 --> 2:18:31.240]  the biography of somebody who has worked as a spy and on top of my list there was bilbini and i
[2:18:31.240 --> 2:18:37.720]  asked him this was in 2013 actually so this was like two months after snowden oh yeah you put a
[2:18:37.720 --> 2:18:43.240]  lot of work into this film this is amazing and so i asked biland he said yes i'm on board and this
[2:18:43.240 --> 2:18:48.440]  is how i started and has it changed my life yes totally yeah i've been around a lot of hollywood
[2:18:48.440 --> 2:18:52.440]  folks and that doesn't excite me very much unless they have courage like the last cast we had on
[2:18:52.440 --> 2:18:56.600]  but when you're around bennie you realize like in mainline publications this is one of the top
[2:18:56.600 --> 2:19:03.000]  mathematicians super brains help defeat the soviet union has all these secret awards and here's the
[2:19:03.000 --> 2:19:08.040]  government swat teaming him probably doing other stuff to him he didn't want to get into and it's
[2:19:08.040 --> 2:19:13.000]  just it's amazing to be out at dinner with this guy and then realize i'm not really paranoid there
[2:19:13.000 --> 2:19:19.080]  are people following us i mean it's it's it's it's it's very interesting and uh not not only in
[2:19:19.080 --> 2:19:26.200]  america i mean uh of course the story of bill is a very american story but uh in the end we are really
[2:19:26.200 --> 2:19:31.400]  having the same trouble in europe over here so you're right stay there the filmmaker fredrik

[2:24:26.920 --> 2:24:33.160]  scolese and stable we were sitting ducks trail of blood gunman kill as many republicans as you can
[2:24:34.120 --> 2:24:39.480]  and the video is now up on info wars dot com of wilson blitzer having a guest on just saying hey
[2:24:40.040 --> 2:24:45.320]  this is just politics he wasn't an evil man again i didn't use me a republican or a democrat i want
[2:24:45.320 --> 2:24:50.680]  to be clear but the democrats are the deep state now along with the republican leadership and
[2:24:50.680 --> 2:24:56.280]  they're coming after trump because he's transferring power back to the country that is just a fact
[2:24:57.160 --> 2:25:02.200]  so that is uh coming up oh he wasn't evil no he was just tired of things so he went and
[2:25:02.200 --> 2:25:07.320]  what shot a couple cops shot some other person shot shot a congressman he just said are those
[2:25:07.320 --> 2:25:12.920]  republicans yes and my point is the media is hyping it what are they trying to do i'm going to
[2:25:12.920 --> 2:25:16.600]  ask william benny that at the start of the next segment and play a few clips of the new film but
[2:25:16.600 --> 2:25:22.440]  going back to mr benny uh looking at what muhler did looking at what comey did looking at how they
[2:25:22.440 --> 2:25:27.000]  ignored all the other big crimes they knew about looking at how they've admittedly been caught
[2:25:27.640 --> 2:25:32.680]  in the new york times targeting trump trump points out it's illegal then they say oh no we
[2:25:32.680 --> 2:25:37.800]  never spied on you what's the truth as an expert william benny of expose facts dot org
[2:25:37.800 --> 2:25:44.680]  uh the truth is uh everybody's being copied and collected all their data but uh
[2:25:45.480 --> 2:25:49.400]  that when when they go after people have to specifically target them in the database so
[2:25:49.400 --> 2:25:55.160]  they go after them specifically so in this case it wasn't that he was specifically wiretapped
[2:25:55.160 --> 2:26:01.960]  it was he was he was captured in mass surveillance but he was targeted by going in by going in with
[2:26:01.960 --> 2:26:09.480]  specifics about him into that database and pulling everything out about him so to explain they
[2:26:09.480 --> 2:26:14.120]  basically just capture everything they've got it these buckets and that was you've been confirmed
[2:26:14.120 --> 2:26:19.160]  by snowden you helped design the systems and then they can then just go into those databases
[2:26:19.160 --> 2:26:24.520]  if they want can't they also plant things uh yeah that's also possible it's it's possible to
[2:26:24.520 --> 2:26:29.400]  manipulate things to make it look like somebody else did it also so it's not it's not uh i mean
[2:26:29.400 --> 2:26:34.120]  once you have the data you can do anything you want to with it william benny former technical
[2:26:34.120 --> 2:26:39.240]  head of the nsa let's expand on this you talked about this a lot in the years you've come on
[2:26:39.960 --> 2:26:45.720]  but that they now admit with the latest data dumps with the uh vault seven that they were also
[2:26:45.720 --> 2:26:51.320]  spoofing other countries and then attacking the united states uh how does that tie into all this
[2:26:52.360 --> 2:26:56.440]  well i looked at that cyber security is another swindle you know what they're doing is they
[2:26:56.440 --> 2:27:01.240]  they've known about all these weaknesses all along for decades in fact some of them and they've never
[2:27:01.240 --> 2:27:05.800]  told anybody to fix them or how what needs to be fixed and so they left everybody vulnerable
[2:27:05.800 --> 2:27:10.760]  then every time somebody got attacked they would say okay we need more money for cyber security
[2:27:10.760 --> 2:27:15.160]  and they never fixed the things they knew were wrong so they they basically are swindling us
[2:27:17.720 --> 2:27:22.040]  so they're creating the new economy or hijacking it through cyber security and nsa
[2:27:22.040 --> 2:27:27.480]  then creating swiss cheese problems and creating private companies and systems and governmental
[2:27:27.480 --> 2:27:33.400]  systems to then service all the problems they've created yeah but uh you know we the poor taxpayers
[2:27:33.400 --> 2:27:39.800]  are paying through the nose to get spied on and manipulated and and uh and basically uh told what
[2:27:39.800 --> 2:27:44.760]  to do fundamentally by the by the mainstream media that does nothing more than regurgitate
[2:27:44.760 --> 2:27:48.920]  what the what the government's saying which means they're going to spy what are going to
[2:27:48.920 --> 2:27:52.600]  spot what that what they're told to stop and that's it and that's all we bring that except
[2:27:52.600 --> 2:27:59.240]  for very few programs like yours for example or some others you know but that's it and by the way
[2:27:59.240 --> 2:28:04.280]  it's come out in the news through sheriff arpaio an older database of who was being surveilled a
[2:28:04.280 --> 2:28:09.320]  law enforcement database we think a dea database but uh i was in there trump was in there the reason
[2:28:09.320 --> 2:28:14.200]  i knew it was real i had trumps marlago phone number his trump tower number his backup number
[2:28:14.200 --> 2:28:18.680]  and another number and and then they had numbers i had from offices like five years ago
[2:28:18.680 --> 2:28:23.800]  that no one ever had they had my private office number that even use and they were active i mean
[2:28:23.800 --> 2:28:32.200]  this just came out we were leaked this info mr benny what do you make of that well that's that's
[2:28:32.200 --> 2:28:35.960]  basically uh what they do it doesn't matter whether or not to use the phone if they can
[2:28:35.960 --> 2:28:40.280]  tie a phone to you they'll they'll just put it in the system and the system will automatically
[2:28:40.280 --> 2:28:45.480]  monitor it for any communications you activate and if you do they got it if you don't they they're
[2:28:45.480 --> 2:28:49.880]  they're still monitoring you now again i know all these other agencies with their parallel construction
[2:28:49.880 --> 2:28:55.400]  get into the msa but why would this be an fbi dea database i've never been investigated for drugs
[2:28:55.400 --> 2:29:00.600]  that they just and trump as well they just use that as an excuse because the file we got well
[2:29:00.600 --> 2:29:05.800]  there's millions of files but i mean we got a snippet of it it was just every phone we've ever
[2:29:05.800 --> 2:29:10.840]  used and then and then it was just an admission that that was a targeted database if they wanted
[2:29:10.840 --> 2:29:17.560]  to go further and try to get into it yeah i what it is basically is the fbi and the cia and
[2:29:17.560 --> 2:29:25.080]  promoted to the fbi including the dea as the special operations division uh they have direct
[2:29:25.080 --> 2:29:30.200]  access into the nsa database then could pull out data and target people in any any time they want
[2:29:30.200 --> 2:29:34.680]  they can go and get the tips from the people on the street and they can go into that database
[2:29:34.680 --> 2:29:38.200]  and target them and see what they're doing that's fundamentally what they're doing but
[2:29:38.200 --> 2:29:43.640]  it's not a surprise to me that this there should also be in dhs and uh a number of other agencies
[2:29:43.640 --> 2:29:47.480]  in the u.s government sure the only reason we got this leak was obviously it was connected to
[2:29:47.480 --> 2:29:54.840]  local law enforcement but well they're out in the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn
[2:29:54.840 --> 2:30:03.720]  radio network a team of global warming scientists were forced to cancel an arctic trip due to extreme
[2:30:03.720 --> 2:30:08.200]  ice conditions which highlights how the advocacy against man-made climate change is actually a
[2:30:08.200 --> 2:30:12.360]  global scheme to weaken the u.s economy a group of 40 scientists were on board the anilson a
[2:30:12.360 --> 2:30:16.760]  research ship known for its ice breaking capabilities but this time the ice proved too thick for the
[2:30:16.760 --> 2:30:21.160]  ship to break through safely right on cue one of the researchers blamed the ice on man-made climate
[2:30:21.160 --> 2:30:25.400]  change but notice how it's typically government-funded scientists and politicians who are pushing the
[2:30:25.400 --> 2:30:29.400]  climate change agenda despite the fact that historically the biggest polluter in the world
[2:30:29.400 --> 2:30:33.880]  is the government you see the globalist harped dangers of man-made climate change which they renamed
[2:30:33.880 --> 2:30:37.960]  from global warming once the data didn't fit their agenda to push for carbon taxes and carbon
[2:30:37.960 --> 2:30:42.600]  currencies that allowed them to subjugate the u.s by impoverishing americans for a new technocratic
[2:30:42.600 --> 2:30:46.760]  form of colonialism the globalists don't want independent nation states with strong economies
[2:30:46.760 --> 2:30:51.000]  they want unelected super regional governments like the e u consisting of member states that are
[2:30:51.000 --> 2:30:55.640]  subordinate to the globalist controlled economy driven by multinational banks and other unelected
[2:30:55.640 --> 2:31:00.680]  global bodies find out more at info wars dot com this is kid daniel's reporting it's not just our
[2:31:00.680 --> 2:31:05.160]  water we need to filter it's not just our food that needs to be cleaned it's the air we're breathing
[2:31:05.160 --> 2:31:11.320]  especially for our children the artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing

[2:31:49.240 --> 2:31:55.160]  my house replacing older more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job find out why this system
[2:31:55.160 --> 2:32:01.960]  is so revolutionary today and then full war store dot com we've taken thousands of years of known
[2:32:01.960 --> 2:32:07.480]  research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best

[2:33:19.400 --> 2:33:25.400]  clip from the award-winning film a good american stunning and deeply disturbing newsweek an
[2:33:25.400 --> 2:33:29.640]  extraordinary story of an extraordinary spy william benney and more the executive producer
[2:33:30.200 --> 2:33:35.000]  from the executive producer of oliver stone a frederick mosher film here it is
[2:33:43.880 --> 2:33:45.160]  everything is human behavior
[2:33:45.160 --> 2:33:54.760]  human behavior is extremely patterned
[2:33:56.360 --> 2:34:02.120]  how do people operate how do they interact and how does that manifest or appear in this abstract
[2:34:02.120 --> 2:34:16.280]  set of communications you're looking at i couldn't understand why a lot of people couldn't see what i could see
[2:34:16.280 --> 2:34:21.080]  man i tell you it's a powerful movie i've watched it i can't wait to have my children watch it
[2:34:21.080 --> 2:34:26.280]  because this is what it's really all about wow again a good american i'm gonna play one more clip
[2:34:26.280 --> 2:34:29.640]  and go back and give both our guests four or five minutes of the floor because i know they've got to
[2:34:29.640 --> 2:34:41.240]  go but let's play the graph another clip uh from the film
[2:34:41.240 --> 2:34:56.840]  i basically envisioned the graph as very large globe of the earth same
[2:35:00.520 --> 2:35:04.120]  with a total of about seven billion nodes in it or dots
[2:35:04.120 --> 2:35:08.680]  each representing an individual
[2:35:11.400 --> 2:35:15.960]  and having all the connections of all those individuals with all the other connections
[2:35:15.960 --> 2:35:19.720]  they have anywhere in the world
[2:35:19.720 --> 2:35:32.120]  think of yourselves as drifting into the globe
[2:35:37.480 --> 2:35:40.680]  so you're going inside the globe and you can go to any point in the globe
[2:35:40.680 --> 2:35:50.280]  and look at any given point to see the relationships they have with all the other dots in the globe
[2:35:53.720 --> 2:36:00.280]  when you go into the globe you pick out a dot you can pull it out of that relationship graph
[2:36:00.280 --> 2:36:03.640]  and with it will come all of the nodes that it has a relationship with
[2:36:06.040 --> 2:36:10.360]  when you pull that node out in its community if you will the social network it had
[2:36:10.360 --> 2:36:14.840]  you pulled all of the backup data that created those relationships to begin with
[2:36:15.480 --> 2:36:19.800]  so that you can now timeline those relationships and see the interactions
[2:36:19.800 --> 2:36:21.800]  over a period of time whatever you wanted to find
[2:36:24.120 --> 2:36:26.440]  so that's that's how i envisioned the graph
[2:36:29.640 --> 2:36:34.360]  this is godlike stuff and that's where we are that's why free will is so important
[2:36:34.360 --> 2:36:38.520]  don't give your free will over to these technocracies you got a new film coming out the maze
[2:36:38.520 --> 2:36:44.760]  of course talking about the director of this film and the producer of this film a good american
[2:36:44.760 --> 2:36:49.960]  available again at info or store dot com from executive producer oliver stone a frederick
[2:36:49.960 --> 2:36:54.040]  mosher films oliver stone of course is involved in this little jewel as well i just love oliver
[2:36:54.040 --> 2:36:59.880]  stone uh stone cold truth dot com is coming up the next hour with roger stone but right now
[2:36:59.880 --> 2:37:05.960]  we are talking to william benning and we're also talking to frederick mosher blue and green dot info
[2:37:05.960 --> 2:37:10.120]  i've been asking my questions i want to go to mr mosher for five minutes then to mr benning for
[2:37:10.120 --> 2:37:13.720]  five minutes i'm gonna let you go and take phone calls from folks that are holding patiently but
[2:37:14.280 --> 2:37:18.120]  you guys are the experts you make the film what else do you want to say about the film and about
[2:37:18.120 --> 2:37:21.240]  the state of the world because i want to talk about the film but the film is the state of the
[2:37:21.240 --> 2:37:25.240]  world is like a window deep into what's really happening but then i keep trying to tie it into
[2:37:25.240 --> 2:37:35.640]  what's currently happening uh it's just amazing who of us a jump in frederick first go ahead um
[2:37:35.640 --> 2:37:45.640]  so i think if i mean what what what to me is really worrying is that despite all the attacks that
[2:37:45.640 --> 2:37:50.520]  have happened since 9 11 because basically the program that bill benning developed since red
[2:37:50.520 --> 2:37:58.360]  would have had everything to stop 9 11 up front a long time before and this despite all the attacks
[2:37:58.360 --> 2:38:05.160]  that have happened since 9 11 uh politicians are still pushing for the same medicine which doesn't
[2:38:05.160 --> 2:38:11.640]  cure anything and this is my surveillance and i think i think why this film is still important
[2:38:11.640 --> 2:38:18.360]  even if it stops you know in time of the in terms of the history in terms of history it goes from
[2:38:18.360 --> 2:38:24.040]  the 60s to 2007 but i think because the reason why it's still important is because we need to
[2:38:24.040 --> 2:38:30.760]  think differently about surveillance at all and about national security at all i i think we are
[2:38:30.760 --> 2:38:38.520]  on a totally we're losing it and and i sent you over a small piece from my new film the maze
[2:38:38.520 --> 2:38:44.120]  which looks into the terror attacks that happened since 2005 since the 7 7 london attacks and it
[2:38:44.120 --> 2:38:50.520]  goes up to the manchester attacks of two weeks ago and um if you see it there yeah play the clip
[2:38:52.920 --> 2:38:56.920]  but we will definitely have you on about that film i want to know this from so amazing i definitely
[2:38:56.920 --> 2:39:01.960]  want to have you on about that but yeah go ahead and roll the clip from the start let's go ahead
[2:39:01.960 --> 2:39:07.320]  and roll this clip from the new film uh the maze from frederick moser let's start it over go ahead
[2:39:07.320 --> 2:39:20.200]  and roll it thank you london boston paris san benedino brosles orlando nice rutzburg ansbach
[2:39:20.200 --> 2:39:31.800]  santa tienda rufe berlin westminster stockholm and manchester 14 terrorist incidents 32 perpetrators
[2:39:31.800 --> 2:39:42.760]  over 400 dead more than 2400 injured bombs firearms and acts trucks and a car attackers between the
[2:39:42.760 --> 2:39:49.640]  ages of 17 and 52 while the backgrounds of the attackers are quite diverse there seems to be
[2:39:49.640 --> 2:39:57.000]  a pattern in each attack at least one of the terrorists was known to the police in each attack
[2:39:57.000 --> 2:40:04.760]  the perpetrators were part of a network in each attack the terrorists were communicating electronically
[2:40:04.760 --> 2:40:11.400]  with each other all with their backers in each attack there was a digital footprint clearly
[2:40:11.400 --> 2:40:19.160]  indicating radicalization how can it be that despite all these traces and evidence the
[2:40:19.160 --> 2:40:27.480]  intelligence services had no idea that these attacks were being plotted let me see about the
[2:40:27.480 --> 2:40:31.480]  answer for frederick moser and then of course former head of technical actually ran the nsa
[2:40:31.480 --> 2:40:35.400]  william benning i've been interviewing benning for like five six years but i've been reading his stuff
[2:40:35.400 --> 2:40:41.640]  since they swat team me 14 years ago whatever when he exposed us to congress to the proper secret
[2:40:41.640 --> 2:40:47.880]  channels they spy on everything because the globalist the corporations want corporate data
[2:40:47.880 --> 2:40:52.120]  and general data for general control when instead of you target certain things legally
[2:40:52.120 --> 2:40:57.800]  and lawfully the way you're supposed to uh with the i guess the politically incorrect term you
[2:40:57.800 --> 2:41:04.840]  know to use uh would be profiling then you could actually stop people by looking at the real networks
[2:41:04.840 --> 2:41:10.760]  themselves instead of everybody but if you try to search a field for a needle instead of just
[2:41:10.760 --> 2:41:16.440]  searching the the haystack there's no way to find it benning found a way to search the haystack
[2:41:16.440 --> 2:41:21.640]  not the field is that an accurate way of saying it william benning yeah that's right alex it was
[2:41:21.640 --> 2:41:25.960]  way of using the graph that was a way of looking into the massive amounts of data and pulling out
[2:41:25.960 --> 2:41:31.320]  only what is relevant but they didn't want that because that wouldn't take over the entire internet
[2:41:31.320 --> 2:41:35.480]  the entire grid and make them kings of the earth yeah and it wouldn't cost a lot of money either
[2:41:36.440 --> 2:41:41.880]  but it makes us blinded to to to real threats yeah and it well it fundamentally dumps all
[2:41:41.880 --> 2:41:46.680]  this stuff on the analyst and they have to figure it out edward stoten in the material he released
[2:41:46.680 --> 2:41:51.400]  there were about 10 different articles written by analysts inside nsa saying they were too buried
[2:41:51.400 --> 2:41:56.680]  they couldn't find anything they couldn't find find the bad guys and and and monitor just like
[2:41:56.680 --> 2:42:02.840]  just like meuler cut the white collar criminal investigators by 72 percent and then comey did
[2:42:02.840 --> 2:42:07.560]  it further this is on purpose isn't it william well i certainly don't think they want us to know
[2:42:07.560 --> 2:42:11.320]  anything they're doing that's probably part of the reason the other reason is they might be found
[2:42:11.320 --> 2:42:17.880]  out themselves or what they're doing exactly so it's the perfect criminal conspiracy spy on everyone
[2:42:17.880 --> 2:42:21.960]  instead of known criminals and terrorists because then that allows the criminals to run wild this
[2:42:21.960 --> 2:42:29.720]  is incredible prevet moser your comments on this this is profound well uh i'm not so familiar with
[2:42:30.680 --> 2:42:38.360]  comey and molla because that's uh america's internal politics but what i can say is that
[2:42:38.360 --> 2:42:44.360]  um there is a real problem with the massive amount of data that they are collecting and
[2:42:44.360 --> 2:42:49.720]  uh we had people say this in in our new film the maze for example the former
[2:42:50.360 --> 2:42:57.000]  uk head of cyber security saying it you know it's simply not working so i think i think this
[2:42:57.000 --> 2:43:01.080]  entire surveillance thing has become totally ideological and it shouldn't be it should be
[2:43:01.080 --> 2:43:07.000]  above ideology absolutely i think it is it is a technical problem and it calls for a technical
[2:43:07.000 --> 2:43:12.600]  solution or several technical solutions when the solution that we have in place now does not work
[2:43:12.600 --> 2:43:17.480]  obviously wow well let me see the maze i know that was out i want to carry that i want to see
[2:43:17.480 --> 2:43:22.360]  an amazing prevet moser i mean i mean no wonder that you know oliver stones you know helping you
[2:43:22.360 --> 2:43:27.080]  fund produce your films you're amazing filmmaker it i mean in closing though this really is the
[2:43:27.080 --> 2:43:34.680]  future like electricity or like uh the wheel or fire this power of technocracy to track everything
[2:43:34.680 --> 2:43:39.640]  should be the number one debate no wonder msm wanted to act like for decades as it was being
[2:43:39.640 --> 2:43:44.280]  developed it just didn't exist because they didn't want the little people involved in the
[2:43:44.280 --> 2:43:49.240]  discussion about the future architect of the world and so thank god that you and oliver stone and
[2:43:49.240 --> 2:43:54.280]  william benney uh especially william benney and edward snowden william let me say this like i
[2:43:54.280 --> 2:43:59.480]  know snowden broke the law what he did but he said great once they prosecute all the big criminals
[2:43:59.480 --> 2:44:04.040]  you know that are a thousand times worse maybe go after him but i mean is he not overall a hero he
[2:44:04.040 --> 2:44:09.400]  didn't give away the actual targets and people like the opm hack he didn't do that i mean he
[2:44:09.400 --> 2:44:15.960]  exposed illegal spying i mean you know you where's your view on that well i think that that part of
[2:44:15.960 --> 2:44:20.840]  the exposure of all the criminal activity is is absolutely he's a hero and that i mean he had the
[2:44:20.840 --> 2:44:25.080]  guts to take all that material out and show it but there was some of the material that uh that
[2:44:25.080 --> 2:44:30.520]  got printed that shouldn't have been uh you know it was listing some specific targets that that
[2:44:30.520 --> 2:44:35.080]  shouldn't be coming out but the other stuff about all this illegal activity that they're doing
[2:44:35.080 --> 2:44:40.760]  internally in the united states and around the world basically uh war crimes and things like that
[2:44:40.760 --> 2:44:45.560]  also uh it needs to be exposed and we need to have it we need to have it out in public so
[2:44:45.560 --> 2:44:50.520]  that everybody can say let's stop this crap or or you know do we want our government doing this for
[2:44:50.520 --> 2:44:55.800]  us well i never agree with liberals on gun control or things like that but i agreed on let's not have
[2:44:55.800 --> 2:45:02.200]  spying let's not launch wars preemptively now they love wars now they love spying now they
[2:45:02.200 --> 2:45:08.440]  say kill everybody so all i'm asking is where are the liberals william benny but previously
[2:45:08.440 --> 2:45:13.720]  criticized the nsa now because they had eight years of obama they think it's the greatest thing
[2:45:13.720 --> 2:45:19.560]  since pumpkin pie yeah well obama was one that doubled down and everything that bush had done
[2:45:19.560 --> 2:45:24.680]  and and so it's only made it worse and and and now so we're getting to this point now where we
[2:45:24.680 --> 2:45:29.640]  we hire people like mueller to investigate the the president and cover up for combi or investigate
[2:45:29.640 --> 2:45:35.080]  combi too and you know it's like the criminals i think the the fox is running the henhouse here
[2:45:35.080 --> 2:45:40.520]  is basically what's going on and you know you can't trust any of these people i mean we we need to
[2:45:40.520 --> 2:45:45.160]  find people who are not in any way tainted with anything in washington or anything that's uh
[2:45:45.160 --> 2:45:48.840]  been the establishment for years because if you don't you're going to get somebody who's going to
[2:45:48.840 --> 2:45:53.400]  you know cover up for one another that's what they've been doing all along covering up for each other
[2:45:53.400 --> 2:45:58.280]  they're clearly emboldened by the fact that they're spying on the president in real time
[2:45:58.280 --> 2:46:03.480]  and he keeps asking how are there leaks when it's me and one person in the room because it's the
[2:46:03.480 --> 2:46:09.480]  computer it's the iphone they don't need to put bugs in the white house all the devices are the
[2:46:09.480 --> 2:46:15.720]  bugs that is now declassified that is now a fact and the president can't understand why
[2:46:15.720 --> 2:46:20.600]  all these bureaucracies literally know when he goes to the bathroom can you explain to the president
[2:46:20.600 --> 2:46:25.880]  what's happening to him mr benny i know he watches the show uh yes i can and i've been i sent a note
[2:46:25.880 --> 2:46:32.440]  into him and also the uh the general attorney general sessions about uh the the way to really
[2:46:32.440 --> 2:46:38.280]  go forward in a constitutional law abiding way and be able to actually succeed against terrorism
[2:46:38.280 --> 2:46:44.440]  and other crimes instead of doing this this bulk acquisition on everybody that puts data in databases
[2:46:44.440 --> 2:46:48.440]  so that anybody in the government anywhere can access it now that gives the opportunity for
[2:46:48.440 --> 2:46:53.480]  them to leak anything in the world they want on anybody because that's what nsa has stored
[2:46:54.200 --> 2:46:58.920]  and isn't opm 15 million 20 million now they're saying all the government agents all the spies
[2:46:58.920 --> 2:47:05.640]  i believe it was 20 a little over 21 million people that were hacked or data that has been
[2:47:05.640 --> 2:47:09.960]  so it's growing and isn't that what you said on the show five years ago the great danger is you
[2:47:09.960 --> 2:47:14.440]  give this huge bulk of data of course they're going to be spies of course it's going to leak
[2:47:14.440 --> 2:47:19.400]  i mean aren't you like blowing up your own ship your own pandora's box by creating this giant
[2:47:19.400 --> 2:47:25.320]  data dump is it the answer is not storing bulk acquisition for security yeah that's that's but
[2:47:25.320 --> 2:47:30.760]  that's been my point all along uh you don't get you don't get security with bulk acquisition of data
[2:47:30.760 --> 2:47:36.120]  i mean the the idea that you had to give up privacy for security has been a lie from the
[2:47:36.120 --> 2:47:40.280]  beginning it was a lie because they wanted to get all information on everybody in the world
[2:47:40.280 --> 2:47:44.360]  and also they wanted to spend a lot of money and build an empire and doing it sure i don't
[2:47:44.360 --> 2:47:47.400]  know it's classified and you haven't been there in years but you helped set the whole thing up
[2:47:47.400 --> 2:47:50.280]  they admit that you're the you're the you're the mastermind let me know they say you're the
[2:47:50.280 --> 2:47:55.960]  mastermind one of the top mastermind who then decides the targeting under your limited system
[2:47:55.960 --> 2:48:02.040]  is it algorithms computers this humet put in the data and then the computers decide uh it's a mixture
[2:48:02.040 --> 2:48:07.320]  of things they you know it's like they have software that scores content or speech in a phone call
[2:48:08.360 --> 2:48:13.720]  and they they look at phrases and words and have a scoring algorithm it goes through and says if it
[2:48:13.720 --> 2:48:19.880]  reaches this level and score we're going to transfer it to a human to transcribe and record
[2:48:19.880 --> 2:48:26.680]  and and put a record of the transcript out if it if it's not something like that but they're
[2:48:26.680 --> 2:48:30.520]  like they're going after president trump they're going specifically with his phone numbers and
[2:48:30.520 --> 2:48:35.960]  email or any twitter accounts anything and they're going in and into the NSA database and pulling
[2:48:35.960 --> 2:48:41.400]  data out on him so that that means it's data collected from any source anywhere in the world
[2:48:41.400 --> 2:48:48.120]  or out of this world unbelievable all right william benny expose facts dot org frederick
[2:48:48.120 --> 2:48:53.480]  mozer blue and green dot info the new film a good american available info or store dot

[2:49:05.400 --> 2:49:08.920]  thanks for having me there and then the thing that i'm most worried about is actually the
[2:49:08.920 --> 2:49:15.800]  internet of things it's the connected world it's the self-driving cars it's the smart electricity
[2:49:15.800 --> 2:49:22.280]  the smart heating the smart fridge this is these are the things that really vary me because if you
[2:49:22.280 --> 2:49:28.600]  have the entire system surveilled this allows you not only to listen into but to play with your life
[2:49:28.600 --> 2:49:34.920]  with our lives and i think this is not the world that i desire for myself or for my kids it's it's
[2:49:34.920 --> 2:49:41.160]  as simple as that well that's right i mean i've thought about i want healthy happy children i
[2:49:41.160 --> 2:49:45.240]  want to help people i want a good healthy life for myself and i just dream of a house that isn't
[2:49:45.240 --> 2:49:50.120]  all surveilled with all these gadgets and none of them work right and they're always screwing up i
[2:49:50.120 --> 2:49:55.240]  like dream of the old days of analog i think that's the next big economy with our own consumer
[2:49:55.240 --> 2:50:00.680]  choices i think all of us together should just vote to go back to analog except for very limited
[2:50:00.680 --> 2:50:05.640]  parts of our lives and i think it's a human revolution versus technology i think technology's
[2:50:05.640 --> 2:50:10.280]  been subverted and we have to kind of you know put a pause on this gentlemen thank you so much

[2:53:57.960 --> 2:54:13.160]  i woke up 6am this morning i looked at my iphone my little digital tracker system
[2:54:14.440 --> 2:54:20.520]  and i saw the top story in the country was not jeff sessions it was me every major tv show every
[2:54:20.520 --> 2:54:24.760]  major news show and i thought man i don't mind these lies about me because people will find the
[2:54:24.760 --> 2:54:29.400]  real show and find out what i'm really saying but man is this going to go all the way through next
[2:54:29.400 --> 2:54:33.800]  week with this megan kelly hit piece and how she probably edited me and all the rest of it
[2:54:36.200 --> 2:54:40.440]  i thought i wonder if there'll be some terror attack or some event that gets me out of the news
[2:54:41.080 --> 2:54:46.120]  i remember thinking well i hope they're in the terror attack but man i'm really sick of being in
[2:54:46.120 --> 2:54:52.680]  the news even though i asked for all this i'm it's not fun i'm in a war i expect it i'm ready for it
[2:54:52.680 --> 2:54:58.680]  and then about an hour and a half later i started getting the calls about the baseball game and the
[2:54:58.680 --> 2:55:07.720]  rest of it you know i ate the morning let me tell you when you're the top news story in the country
[2:55:07.720 --> 2:55:15.400]  it's weird and when they're lying about you it's even weirder and i'm not complaining it just shows
[2:55:15.400 --> 2:55:21.480]  how weak they are that they're worried about me but they're really worried about you and the
[2:55:21.480 --> 2:55:25.400]  guess we have on here at the broadcast and our affiliates and our sponsors and the fact that
[2:55:25.400 --> 2:55:29.400]  they can't take us down without just killing me the problem is the democrats and the globlists
[2:55:29.400 --> 2:55:33.800]  are now going to that they're killing people they're calling for debt they want war and at some point
[2:55:35.480 --> 2:55:42.360]  i guess they're gonna get it i mean i i don't want to see them defeated but i've looked at all
[2:55:42.360 --> 2:55:44.920]  the angles man they start a real war with the patriot movement
[2:55:44.920 --> 2:55:52.680]  i mean killing is our business lady globlists all of you people
[2:55:56.280 --> 2:55:58.520]  that's why we built america was trying to stop doing that
[2:56:01.320 --> 2:56:05.320]  killing people and overrunning scum like you and dominate news real easy we're trying to build
[2:56:05.320 --> 2:56:11.560]  you up not kill you see we're beyond parasites like you that want to make weak people weaker to
[2:56:11.560 --> 2:56:16.120]  dominate them we want to empower weak people but we're not going to be dominated by you you understand
[2:56:16.760 --> 2:56:22.440]  so you you're pushing it a little too far and your false flags won't work nothing your losers
[2:56:22.440 --> 2:56:28.040]  you were losers from the start so the globlists and hillary and all of them know this i got your

[2:56:54.680 --> 2:57:01.960]  chelsea oh thank god i'm not with dishonorable people like you thank god let's go to dave and
[2:57:01.960 --> 2:57:07.400]  shelly dave you're only here worldwide thanks for holding well thanks for having me today i want to
[2:57:07.400 --> 2:57:13.880]  say this if you're stepping up a network i want to be able to point my satellite dish at a free
[2:57:13.880 --> 2:57:20.040]  satellite and receive your content over my tv rather than through the internet now my second
[2:57:20.040 --> 2:57:28.840]  point is this in order for uh president trump to get rid of that face hugger that's on the
[2:57:28.840 --> 2:57:38.280]  uh american economy he's got to send federal troops into the federal reserve and stop calling
[2:57:38.280 --> 2:57:42.440]  it the federal reserve well i mean he can fire yellen who's about to raise interest rates that's
[2:57:42.440 --> 2:57:46.200]  one of the bad things trump's done is keeping janet yelling at the new york fed that actually
[2:57:46.200 --> 2:57:51.000]  runs it and she's about to raise interest rates again to kill the economy uh that that is not a
[2:57:51.000 --> 2:57:56.440]  good idea and and i hear you so trump's not perfect by long shot but you know him by his enemies but
[2:57:56.440 --> 2:58:02.120]  uh what do you make of that well i think that uh what what they're really trying to do is
[2:58:02.120 --> 2:58:07.880]  it's exactly what you say they're setting him up they're setting him up uh for a big fault
[2:58:07.880 --> 2:58:13.880]  they don't want this guy in charge they don't want him in charge why because he knows what their end
[2:58:13.880 --> 2:58:19.240]  game is he's old-fashioned he wants american prosperity he doesn't get we can just screw all
[2:58:19.240 --> 2:58:26.440]  the people and be globalistic are they trump's totally real he wants everyone off welfare he
[2:58:26.440 --> 2:58:31.560]  doesn't want anybody on welfare he wants everybody working he wants them to make a living he wants
[2:58:31.560 --> 2:58:38.600]  them to prosper and so much of hollywood scum want him dead they love you brother get sure

[3:02:04.520 --> 3:02:09.240]  agree with you but more and more more and more the globalists are just criminals the globalists are
[3:02:09.240 --> 3:02:14.040]  just an out of control group they've got a bunch of brainwashed minions that believe mainstream tv
[3:02:14.040 --> 3:02:18.200]  that think it's okay to go kill people because it's quote political i mean what's going to happen if

[3:02:59.560 --> 3:03:06.120]  we need to hide like that you think the dinosaur media knows they're already dead or do you think
[3:03:06.120 --> 3:03:12.600]  they haven't figured that out yet i think they're telling them themselves they're not that they're
[3:03:12.600 --> 3:03:19.320]  still in control you're right it's the zombie media and they've still got the corporate funding

[3:03:59.720 --> 3:04:04.760]  background uh in my younger years i was in the entertainment industry so i know exactly what
[3:04:04.760 --> 3:04:11.480]  these people are doing uh they are using these artists as propagandas um you know i took my
[3:04:11.480 --> 3:04:17.880]  advance and i used it to go back to school i said after contract i'm not going into what they want
[3:04:17.880 --> 3:04:23.080]  me to do as far as lyrical content and stuff like that so now i'm just working a regular

[3:04:45.320 --> 3:04:51.560]  yeah so many people i know in entertainment do whatever they're told but this guy didn't do
[3:04:51.560 --> 3:04:56.360]  that and that's the answer follow your own dream and then even you make less money you keep more
[3:04:56.360 --> 3:05:06.680]  the money you make the fake news continues in a vox pops segment about the testimony of former fbi
[3:05:06.680 --> 3:05:14.440]  director james comey msnbc was caught trying to pretend that a former obama campaign director
[3:05:14.440 --> 3:05:21.560]  was just a random woman on the street giving her opinion and the fact that he would make a very
[3:05:21.560 --> 3:05:27.080]  specific request to have everybody else leave the office so that he would be alone with comey for me
[3:05:27.880 --> 3:05:32.760]  speaks volumes well it turns out that this random woman just happened to be political
[3:05:32.760 --> 3:05:38.360]  strategist alma marquez but this is what we've all learned to expect from the establishment news
[3:05:38.360 --> 3:05:45.640]  media where perhaps the worst reputation belongs to cnn who has a long history of questionable
[3:05:45.640 --> 3:05:53.000]  news reporting including the recent staged muslim anti-terror protest where you can clearly see
[3:05:53.000 --> 3:06:00.600]  host becky anderson directing the entire scene and you can learn more right now at info wars dot com

[3:08:31.480 --> 3:08:35.320]  pointing what appears to be a water gun the image of president donald trump projected on a white
[3:08:35.320 --> 3:08:40.040]  boy our teacher pale modi has not been seen by countless viewers across the internet yes
[3:08:40.040 --> 3:08:45.880]  i have thought an awful lot about blowing up the white house
[3:08:47.960 --> 3:08:54.920]  he's an actor dressed to look just like president donald trump as he's assassinated on stage pictures
[3:08:54.920 --> 3:09:00.360]  and video depicting comedian kathie griffin holding the bloody decapitated hand of president
[3:09:00.360 --> 3:09:07.160]  trump are no joking matter for the secret service a rhetoric that has inspired the violence has come
[3:09:07.160 --> 3:09:12.360]  from the mainstream of the democratic party they're involved in the coup an active attempt
[3:09:12.360 --> 3:09:14.840]  to start a bloody civil war
[3:09:24.760 --> 3:09:30.520]  ladies and gentlemen they lost the election they had fake polls they gave the questions
[3:09:30.520 --> 3:09:37.400]  to the debate and the answers to hillary beforehand and they still lost the eu the communist
[3:09:37.400 --> 3:09:45.160]  chinese the corrupt pope hollywood the democratic party the republican party they all gave
[3:09:47.880 --> 3:09:49.480]  20 to 1 it's 20 to 1
[3:09:52.680 --> 3:09:57.400]  they gave 2 billion to hillary and big banks gave like a million dollars to trump so that's
[3:09:57.400 --> 3:10:02.760]  that's that's that's bigger than 20 to 1 it's like 201 basically trump got nothing from the
[3:10:02.760 --> 3:10:09.560]  establishment and the entire global power structure threw everything it had behind hillary
[3:10:10.360 --> 3:10:15.640]  and they failed and then they start writing articles about we're going to use cog we're
[3:10:15.640 --> 3:10:19.080]  going to kill trump we're going to kill his family we're going to kill roger stone and they poisoned
[3:10:19.080 --> 3:10:23.000]  him with polonium we're going to get alex jones we're going to boycott and they take our sponsors
[3:10:23.000 --> 3:10:25.960]  they take us off google ads we're going to get him we're going to get him we're going to take his
[3:10:25.960 --> 3:10:29.880]  kids away we're gonna we're gonna i mean these people are crazy
[3:10:34.600 --> 3:10:37.880]  and so what do we do as a country now that a congressman
[3:10:37.880 --> 3:10:44.440]  two police officers and other two other citizens are shot and some pig some
[3:10:44.440 --> 3:10:49.400]  bernie sanders supporter we're told probably hillary supporter who says it's time to destroy
[3:10:49.400 --> 3:10:56.040]  trump and his people then we watch cnn i've been watching all day well it's just political well
[3:10:56.040 --> 3:11:04.760]  he's not evil he was just upset about politics so if somebody kills hillary clinton or kills
[3:11:04.760 --> 3:11:10.280]  bill clinton or kills will blitzer or kills ancy polosi or maxine waters or kills any of these
[3:11:10.280 --> 3:11:15.240]  people which i don't want to happen god forbid we're winning politically we're winning with
[3:11:15.240 --> 3:11:21.960]  ideas i mean america and free market first venezuela first north korea not a hard sell
[3:11:21.960 --> 3:11:28.040]  we want to keep things peaceful we're winning we like it we like working we like america we
[3:11:28.040 --> 3:11:33.960]  like going to the ballgame we like airplanes we like food we like medicine we like being successful
[3:11:33.960 --> 3:11:40.440]  we're america you go out to communist rallies with the muslims this weekend in austin all over
[3:11:40.440 --> 3:11:48.600]  the country beating up peaceful people the cops do nothing but this is the natural vacuum where we
[3:11:48.600 --> 3:11:53.720]  sit here and act weak and they just attack us communists walk around with their fingers on
[3:11:53.720 --> 3:11:58.040]  their triggers with m16s maybe not to use them like pointing them at cops i couldn't believe the cops
[3:11:58.040 --> 3:12:02.040]  didn't kill them i'm not for a police state but let me tell you communists are even worse
[3:12:02.680 --> 3:12:05.960]  because they want their own police state once they bully us into submission
[3:12:05.960 --> 3:12:11.480]  here's a clip and we're here in the summer to roger stone finish up with chris in north carolina
[3:12:13.400 --> 3:12:18.440]  of wolf blitzer today and they go oh the producer says go to this clip so they go to a guy in a feed
[3:12:19.640 --> 3:12:26.280]  a friend of this james t hodgkinson who was running around go those republicans yes they're
[3:12:26.280 --> 3:12:31.640]  shooting everybody and he says he was not evil he was upset about politics wolf blitzer goes
[3:12:31.640 --> 3:12:36.680]  mm then i kept watching wolf blitzer he goes let's talk about why he was politically mad
[3:12:37.240 --> 3:12:42.200]  does it bull wolf blitzer get that once he opens the door to this monster
[3:12:43.960 --> 3:12:47.960]  people that were had chivalry we said we didn't target women and children
[3:12:48.520 --> 3:12:54.360]  not because we were wimps but because we cared about our families and knew how vicious war was
[3:12:54.360 --> 3:13:03.160]  you guys aren't warriors you're betas and then you want to make war on the warriors it's i talked
[3:13:03.160 --> 3:13:09.160]  to one scythe guy and he said it's like it's a setup i mean these people have no idea because once
[3:13:09.160 --> 3:13:13.320]  they open the door once they start the civil war which it appears is starting there's not
[3:13:13.320 --> 3:13:19.240]  going to be anywhere for you people to hide i mean killing people is easier than cooking dinner
[3:13:19.240 --> 3:13:27.400]  here i mean see you understand like killing people is is like going on a bird hunt i mean
[3:13:27.400 --> 3:13:33.480]  it's real easy and real men do it like they put their boots on in the morning you people do it
[3:13:33.480 --> 3:13:40.040]  all stylized and we're doing kill kill kill you want to kill us you are opening the gate
[3:13:40.680 --> 3:13:46.760]  to destruction i want to fix this i want to stop this but these spoiled brats had hijacked the
[3:13:46.760 --> 3:13:51.000]  country because we were asleep they're so pissed they think it's still theirs i don't know here's
[3:13:51.000 --> 3:13:57.480]  the club of wolf blitzer uh standby aren't we just getting uh some uh some uh tape in of an
[3:13:57.480 --> 3:14:04.680]  acquaintance of james hodgkinson the 66 year old shooter uh describing some of his political perhaps
[3:14:04.680 --> 3:14:12.360]  the motivations listen to this i just want to let people know that he wasn't evil that he was
[3:14:12.360 --> 3:14:18.600]  i guess tired of some of the politics are going on that's what we just heard perhaps he wasn't
[3:14:18.600 --> 3:14:23.640]  evil just tired of the politics that's going on i mean imagine if we had somebody on the
[3:14:23.640 --> 3:14:27.640]  just shot a bunch of people and we said oh it's just politics no big deal on evil our career would be
[3:14:27.640 --> 3:14:32.760]  over but it's like another little fat obese not not against being fat but you know eats like the
[3:14:32.760 --> 3:14:38.840]  food of eight people in africa and just bitching we want everything free we're all upset you know we
[3:14:38.840 --> 3:14:44.440]  watch ms nbc and stuff and we're pissed and we didn't do anything we just go kill people and shoot
[3:14:44.440 --> 3:14:50.920]  people i mean you know i'm sitting to see monster you don't mind if i kill you i mean you don't mind
[3:14:50.920 --> 3:14:59.240]  if i shoot you i mean we don't know what roger stone what the hell is going on alex this is the
[3:14:59.240 --> 3:15:06.360]  direct manifestation of a climate of hate that has been whipped up by the mainstream media egged on by
[3:15:06.360 --> 3:15:12.760]  the left wing of the democratic party their compatriots this is the direct result of kathy
[3:15:12.760 --> 3:15:18.760]  griffin holding up the severed head of the president of the united states uh and their insane
[3:15:18.760 --> 3:15:26.680]  drive for regime change despite the facts in the background you have uh the special prosecutor
[3:15:26.680 --> 3:15:32.680]  mr muller moving aggressively to try to remove our president to achieve what they couldn't achieve at
[3:15:32.680 --> 3:15:41.400]  the ballot box and these are the shock troops they think this is uh this is extraordinary because we
[3:15:41.400 --> 3:15:50.360]  both know if this had been a democratic congressman and a right of senator center shooter uh we would
[3:15:50.360 --> 3:15:57.400]  be all over this uh because of the hateful ideology of the shooter now we're giving the
[3:15:57.400 --> 3:16:03.960]  shooter a pass and mark my words the media will come back and blame the president for creating
[3:16:03.960 --> 3:16:11.880]  the atmosphere that caused the shooting of a republican congressman i don't get this beta
[3:16:11.880 --> 3:16:17.720]  death dance where they want a civil war they're gonna lose i don't understand it i think i can
[3:16:17.720 --> 3:16:23.560]  explain it you see they think this is venezuela they think that they can roll in with their thug
[3:16:23.560 --> 3:16:30.520]  tactics and they can circumvent the rule of law they can hijack the system and they can undo the
[3:16:30.520 --> 3:16:38.360]  results of the last election the point is this isn't venezuela it's columbia and there are too many
[3:16:38.360 --> 3:16:46.040]  people in the country who are armed and committed to the rule of law who are committed to truth
[3:16:46.040 --> 3:16:55.800]  so if mr muhler puts forward a bogus case against the president despite all of the legal experts
[3:16:55.800 --> 3:17:02.440]  who have told us that there is no obstruction of justice if having found nothing in the phony
[3:17:03.080 --> 3:17:11.240]  russian collusion uh narrative they now switch to uh you know trump's obstructed justice in his
[3:17:11.240 --> 3:17:17.480]  efforts to remove uh to stop the investigation into general flinn i don't think patriots will
[3:17:17.480 --> 3:17:22.680]  stand for it we're going to have uh we're going to spiral into anarchy we're going to have a cycle
[3:17:22.680 --> 3:17:27.960]  of violence like the country has never seen exactly so what do you think wilf blitzer and
[3:17:27.960 --> 3:17:33.240]  flashback tim cayne on info wars dot com the reto lynch called for blood and death of the streets
[3:17:33.240 --> 3:17:37.320]  i mean every major democratic publication calling for violence what are they going to do with somebody
[3:17:37.320 --> 3:17:43.480]  god forbid kills wilf blitzer kills kathy griffin kills bill clinton kills hillary clinton kills him
[3:17:43.480 --> 3:17:50.600]  and then they just say it's just political he wasn't evil no they'll they'll seek to to blame us
[3:17:50.600 --> 3:17:56.120]  for anything that happens that's kind of part of the narrative and right now they could probably
[3:17:56.120 --> 3:18:01.720]  use a martyr it's not good for their narrative that it was a conservative republican congressman
[3:18:01.720 --> 3:18:07.880]  who was shot by some left-wing kook that that doesn't fit their narrative who said it's time
[3:18:07.880 --> 3:18:14.920]  to destroy trump and company but let's be clear reprisals born reprisals and pretty soon everything
[3:18:14.920 --> 3:18:18.840]  will spiral out of control the good news is conservatives libertarians are so restrained
[3:18:19.480 --> 3:18:22.920]  i don't think we'll even respond we're just gonna keep letting them dig their grave but
[3:18:22.920 --> 3:18:27.800]  they've got their big summer of rage sorrows has doubled the funding for riots cop killing all of
[3:18:27.800 --> 3:18:33.800]  it what's gonna happen uh look uh it kind of depends on a triggering event in other words
[3:18:33.800 --> 3:18:40.920]  sorrows and the lefty shock troops need a course of action the left within the democratic party
[3:18:40.920 --> 3:18:45.400]  has failed to make the case on russian collusion they are now going to try to make the case on
[3:18:45.400 --> 3:18:50.440]  obstruction of justice and if that fails they will attempt to pretend that the president is mentally
[3:18:50.440 --> 3:18:54.120]  feeble he's got Alzheimer's you predicted that a few months ago that's now he's not
[3:18:54.120 --> 3:19:02.520]  accomplishmentist it's all bs uh and we will see how far they go uh mr. Mueller is a establishment
[3:19:02.520 --> 3:19:11.480]  stooge the fix is in he is he is going to indict our president despite the facts and he is going
[3:19:11.480 --> 3:19:18.040]  to spark a civil war in this country this isn't going to be 1974 where conservatives sit back
[3:19:18.040 --> 3:19:23.480]  and let them depose our president not happening not happening by the way that's not just confidence
[3:19:23.480 --> 3:19:28.120]  i'm looking historically at the tea leaves and just gut feeling it they they just like they lost
[3:19:28.120 --> 3:19:31.960]  the election through arrogance just like they tried to they are literally about to enter
[3:19:31.960 --> 3:19:36.200]  their waterloo i don't think they realize what they're about to face because i mean the military
[3:19:36.200 --> 3:19:41.560]  is not putting up with it well the average patriot's not going to put up with it they cannot usurp
[3:19:41.560 --> 3:19:48.040]  the rule of law ignore the constitution let criminals like bill and hillary and barack obama
[3:19:48.040 --> 3:19:54.200]  go free after they've been caught red-handed wiretapping and stealing and prosecute donald trump
[3:19:54.760 --> 3:19:59.560]  not going down that way it's like they arrogantly all convince each other in their criminal action
[3:19:59.560 --> 3:20:03.720]  where they're all over the news saying kill trump kill his family and then this guy goes and starts
[3:20:03.720 --> 3:20:09.080]  shooting people and they're trying to like spin that i mean don't they understand what they're
[3:20:09.080 --> 3:20:15.080]  doing don't they understand that most people aren't buying it i mean what are they thinking when
[3:20:15.080 --> 3:20:19.160]  they call for violence don't they know that the people that call for violence first lose
[3:20:20.600 --> 3:20:26.360]  i think you would that perhaps we underestimate the arrogance of the political establishment
[3:20:27.000 --> 3:20:34.600]  if you've controlled events tightly for 30 years and you put down other pro-freedom insurrections
[3:20:34.600 --> 3:20:40.040]  in their view why shouldn't you be able to put down this one after all they control the mainstream
[3:20:40.040 --> 3:20:45.880]  media and they still don't recognize that they're losing power with every passing day they're used
[3:20:45.880 --> 3:20:50.760]  to dictating the tune in this country through their control of both parties and the elites in
[3:20:50.760 --> 3:20:56.680]  both parties and therefore they may think that these tactics will still work they may think they
[3:20:56.680 --> 3:21:04.520]  have the upper hand as long as we have a free and vibrant alternative media that won't be the case
[3:21:04.520 --> 3:21:11.400]  their only chance for success is to silence us here at info wars and at bright part and it's
[3:21:11.400 --> 3:21:17.720]  so cold truth and it's a daily caller and that at every media outlet that isn't lying now that
[3:21:17.720 --> 3:21:22.760]  is making kelly look look i i didn't do 15 minutes like putin so he totally kicked her ass it was a
[3:21:22.760 --> 3:21:27.640]  profile it was really a investigative hit piece she interviewed me for four hours at least i already
[3:21:27.640 --> 3:21:32.680]  saw the promo clip they edited out a context not what i was even saying what are they going to do
[3:21:32.680 --> 3:21:36.680]  though when i've got the tapes of what really happened and then what are they thinking do you
[3:21:36.680 --> 3:21:42.360]  think it's a shill a pr stunt where they claim that people are really pulling their advertising just
[3:21:42.360 --> 3:21:48.360]  to give it hype try to prop up her failing flagging show where they lit me up from below the flashlight
[3:21:48.360 --> 3:21:52.280]  or are they even turning on their own roger you're a astute guy what do you think's really
[3:21:52.280 --> 3:21:57.400]  happening with this meg and kelly fiasco a couple different things alex first of all i heard that
[3:21:57.400 --> 3:22:02.680]  they like held you in some safe house at nine o'clock at night jack the heat up to 100 degrees
[3:22:02.680 --> 3:22:09.240]  10 o'clock at night yeah you know uh in an obvious attempt the way you're lit from below uh this is
[3:22:09.240 --> 3:22:14.280]  all kind of pyrotechnics that should be obvious to people meg and kelly's problem here she has a
[3:22:14.280 --> 3:22:20.760]  giant backlash she's doing this to screw you but her left-wing buddies think that she's doing it
[3:22:20.760 --> 3:22:26.520]  and that you benefit from from expanded exposure they don't get it she's they don't get we already
[3:22:26.520 --> 3:22:34.200]  got 50 times the exposure from their backlash they're so stupid uh and alex i urge you to take the
[3:22:34.200 --> 3:22:39.240]  tape of her initial phone call to you and release it uh because it wasn't privileged i believe it's
[3:22:39.240 --> 3:22:43.800]  being it's being it's being it's being prepared right now my friend i mean i believe that's legal
[3:22:43.800 --> 3:22:49.960]  in texas and people need to know you know what this woman's like what a viper she is i had one of the
[3:22:49.960 --> 3:23:00.040]  top uh woman commentators at fox tell me to my face this woman is a dangerous dangerous vicious
[3:23:00.040 --> 3:23:03.880]  unprincipled client oh listen i was talking to her about five minutes and she was coming on to me
[3:23:03.880 --> 3:23:08.120]  so hard i thought this is a setup i got to record it so i didn't even have an app to record on my
[3:23:08.120 --> 3:23:11.720]  phone i had another office phone so i was recording while i'm driving and i said let me give the
[3:23:11.720 --> 3:23:15.160]  office about five minutes to call you back it was like a saturday i was up here working so i
[3:23:15.160 --> 3:23:19.240]  called her back and i've got the two phone calls and then rob do's and they're getting them downloaded
[3:23:19.240 --> 3:23:25.320]  right now and i mean it's it's exactly what i remembered i mean you talk about you know she
[3:23:25.320 --> 3:23:33.320]  was just it was so over the top fake just oh how oh i'm so amazing and oh she can't wait to meet me
[3:23:33.320 --> 3:23:37.720]  like i'll keep saying lady you hate me i'm not stupid if you want to do the peace fine stop
[3:23:37.720 --> 3:23:42.920]  acting like you're turned on by me we all know you're not okay so it was just completely fake
[3:23:42.920 --> 3:23:50.200]  yeah look she's a viper um but as nici said that which does not kill you only makes you stronger
[3:23:50.200 --> 3:23:55.160]  stronger and the more people who realize that you're out there and you're speaking the truth and
[3:23:55.160 --> 3:24:00.760]  you're not afraid to take on this witch and you know and you acknowledge right up front
[3:24:00.760 --> 3:24:05.320]  that they're going to edit the daylights out of the interview and they're going to take everything
[3:24:05.320 --> 3:24:11.720]  you say out of context and therefore nothing you see can completely be believed i still think you
[3:24:11.720 --> 3:24:17.240]  benefit you're the guy who had the courage to get in the arena with this witch given her
[3:24:17.240 --> 3:24:24.040]  track record roger ailes makes her career at fox she knifes him in the back with a completely
[3:24:24.040 --> 3:24:30.200]  false claim of sexual harassment and let's explain the there was a washington post article today
[3:24:30.200 --> 3:24:34.440]  not about me and megah kelly but just to understand media and it was like al jones preparing his
[3:24:34.440 --> 3:24:40.600]  audience for the interview i knew it was a hit piece i said before i knew that they're so discredited
[3:24:40.600 --> 3:24:45.240]  this only makes us bigger because i thought there'd be a bunch of hype around it not as big as i
[3:24:45.240 --> 3:24:51.400]  i mean i mean it's it's it's bigger than i thought but it's not us putting a good face on it we
[3:24:51.400 --> 3:24:55.480]  know our regular audience doesn't care what she does or how she got it's it so we know we're just
[3:24:55.480 --> 3:25:02.920]  going to get some more new audience it's a win-win but i was there i know it was said she said things
[3:25:02.920 --> 3:25:07.480]  like oh you know you talked about newtown not happening i hurt people's feelings and i explained
[3:25:07.480 --> 3:25:12.120]  no i looked at all different angles i didn't think it happened but they staged the wmd's in iraq
[3:25:12.120 --> 3:25:17.160]  and they staged the babies and the incubators so they've lied about babies before and so you
[3:25:17.160 --> 3:25:22.040]  know none of the media cares about the 500 000 kids that died under expanded sanctions under the
[3:25:22.040 --> 3:25:27.080]  clintons well she just cut the end part about the clintons and sanctions to make it sound like a
[3:25:27.080 --> 3:25:33.800]  dodge i said they've staged babies and incubators under bush one and then they did it again and
[3:25:33.800 --> 3:25:38.920]  madeline albright said it was a good price to pay so i i i it could have been staged because
[3:25:38.920 --> 3:25:44.360]  they staged things so she cuts it where it makes no sense so that's what they did and from the one
[3:25:44.360 --> 3:25:52.360]  clip they played i know that's not what i said it's chopped up well in these mainstream media morons
[3:25:52.360 --> 3:25:57.240]  we feel to acknowledge that the government has throughout history staged false acts perhaps
[3:25:57.240 --> 3:26:04.120]  some will remember the gulf of tongue can attack on us which never actually happens in vietnam and
[3:26:04.120 --> 3:26:10.360]  frankly anybody who will examine the alleged gas attacks by Assad on his own people which are
[3:26:10.360 --> 3:26:14.760]  completely illogical in view of the fact that he claims he's given up his company the u n said it
[3:26:14.760 --> 3:26:20.120]  was a false flag and the russians have vouched for him so he's going to put his patrons at risk
[3:26:20.120 --> 3:26:27.400]  not a chance that was done by our intelligence agencies as a provocation to pull on the president's
[3:26:27.400 --> 3:26:35.400]  heartstrings uh and go for a wholesale invasion of syria the president way too smart for that
[3:26:35.400 --> 3:26:40.920]  narrows this down to a surgical strike uh and he makes his point on the world stage that we're
[3:26:40.920 --> 3:26:46.840]  not going to take any crap but he doesn't buy their secret plan by general mcmasters the
[3:26:46.840 --> 3:26:52.680]  builder burger insider who's burrowed into the trump white house to put 150 000 troops on the ground

[3:30:03.560 --> 3:30:08.280]  these calls for violence are finally working majority whip representative steve scolese out
[3:30:08.280 --> 3:30:13.160]  of louisiana was shot this morning along with several other aides and capital guards and already
[3:30:13.160 --> 3:30:16.840]  there are some amazing quotes coming out of the situation representative rand paul said it would
[3:30:16.840 --> 3:30:21.400]  have been a massacre had there not been good guys with guns representative ron desantis
[3:30:21.400 --> 3:30:25.080]  recounted an odd encounter he had as he was leaving the field just before the shooting there's a guy
[3:30:25.080 --> 3:30:28.680]  that walked up to us and asked whether it was the republicans are democrats out there and it was
[3:30:28.680 --> 3:30:32.440]  just a little odd desantis told fox one of the most harrowing accounts is from representative
[3:30:32.440 --> 3:30:36.760]  moe brooks who talks about taking refuge inside the dugout applying tourniquets to another injured
[3:30:36.760 --> 3:30:40.840]  person and then running out to the field to help representative scolese apply pressure to his wound
[3:30:40.840 --> 3:30:45.160]  but here is one of the most important things he said it's not easy when you see people around you
[3:30:45.160 --> 3:30:48.840]  being shot and you don't have a weapon yourself now democrats are going to come out of the woodwork
[3:30:48.840 --> 3:30:53.080]  and call for more gun control but at this time we should not be relinquishing any of our rights
[3:30:53.080 --> 3:30:57.000]  especially in this climate of violence that is all being sown by the democrats and leftists

[3:33:27.640 --> 3:33:35.400]  welcome back i'm roger stone sitting in for the much beleaguered but unbowed alex jones
[3:33:36.520 --> 3:33:43.960]  the mainstream media assault on him continues unabated yet i'm confident that as his interview
[3:33:43.960 --> 3:33:55.160]  with megan kelly airs people will see through the viciousness the the manipulation and the true motives
[3:33:56.040 --> 3:34:07.000]  of miss kelly and her failing nbc news show i saw recently that reruns on cbs are pulling a much
[3:34:07.000 --> 3:34:16.760]  greater rating than miss kelly i want to be very clear about where we are headed in terms of the
[3:34:16.760 --> 3:34:23.560]  efforts to unseat our president it's very important to understand exactly who robert
[3:34:23.560 --> 3:34:31.800]  muller the special counsel colloquially called a special prosecutor is but above all it's important
[3:34:31.800 --> 3:34:39.320]  to understand that mr muller was appointed solely on the authority and the direction of acting
[3:34:39.320 --> 3:34:48.360]  attorney general rod rozenstein meaning he was not appointed either at the direction of the president
[3:34:48.360 --> 3:34:56.200]  nor at the direction of the president's attorney general former senator jeff sessions sessions
[3:34:56.200 --> 3:35:03.640]  recused himself from the entire russian matter in my opinion unwisely and evidently to the
[3:35:03.640 --> 3:35:11.240]  consternation of the president who was unaware that that recusal was coming we'll look at mr
[3:35:11.240 --> 3:35:18.440]  rozenstein in just a moment but first let's look at mr muller this fellow was appointed as i say
[3:35:18.440 --> 3:35:26.760]  by rozenstein mr muller was james comey's immediate predecessor as the fbi director uh and he was
[3:35:26.760 --> 3:35:36.200]  appointed to that position by george w bush uh when he replaced his deputy that wasn't the first
[3:35:36.200 --> 3:35:42.840]  time mr comey and mr muller's paths would cross in fact i think it would be fair to call them
[3:35:42.840 --> 3:35:53.320]  cronies we now know incredibly that mr muller met with and coached mr comey before his senate
[3:35:53.320 --> 3:36:00.920]  testimony uh in recent days in which he falsely accused the president of obstruction of justice
[3:36:01.800 --> 3:36:09.400]  uh we also know historically that mr muller has been a hitman an executioner for both
[3:36:09.400 --> 3:36:17.960]  the clinton's and the bush's proving that he is a loyal soldier of the deep state and the neocons
[3:36:17.960 --> 3:36:27.400]  who have dominated both parties essentially for the last 30 years uh it was only recently that i
[3:36:27.400 --> 3:36:36.280]  was reminded that it was mr muller who removed all of the anti islamic uh uh terrorism information
[3:36:36.280 --> 3:36:43.560]  from the fbi's training manuals so he is a politically correct and has been part and parcel
[3:36:43.560 --> 3:36:50.680]  of the efforts within both the bush and clinton administrations to lay down to radical islam
[3:36:52.040 --> 3:37:00.280]  it is not just a question of mr muller's intention now we know that he is actively hiring
[3:37:00.280 --> 3:37:08.760]  obama era appointees from the justice department to aid in his investigation of the president
[3:37:09.880 --> 3:37:17.720]  what is there to investigate the facts are known legal scholars across the spectrum had made it
[3:37:17.720 --> 3:37:26.840]  clear that there is no obstruction of justice so what gives it's very simple mr muller is
[3:37:26.840 --> 3:37:32.600]  determined to bring a charge of obstruction against the president regardless of the facts
[3:37:32.600 --> 3:37:40.440]  and regardless of the fact that he has no case having failed with his friends at the nsa uh and
[3:37:40.440 --> 3:37:48.680]  the cia and the others in the intelligence community to make a case for russian collusion
[3:37:48.680 --> 3:37:56.040]  to assist donald trump a scandal for which there is still not to this day an iota of evidence that
[3:37:56.040 --> 3:38:04.680]  would hold up in american court of law we now uh conjure this phony obstruction uh as a triggering
[3:38:04.680 --> 3:38:12.040]  point for the zanies in the left wing of the democratic party bolstered by mr soros to trigger
[3:38:12.040 --> 3:38:19.320]  the insurrection on the ground to destabilize the government and seek to remove donald trump
[3:38:19.320 --> 3:38:29.560]  in the kind of frenzy we saw surrounding the fall of president richard nixon now while we focus
[3:38:30.200 --> 3:38:36.600]  on mr muller i think it's important to take a look at mr rosenstein because looking at
[3:38:36.600 --> 3:38:44.360]  rosenstein's background really informs us about the correctness of the sequence of events
[3:38:44.360 --> 3:38:52.680]  that i have just predicted to you mr rosenstein um is an appointee of the trump administration
[3:38:53.480 --> 3:39:00.440]  but that does not mean unfortunately that he is a conservative or an anti globalist because as we
[3:39:00.440 --> 3:39:07.800]  know uh under the watchful eye of rince previs never trumpers have infiltrated the trump
[3:39:07.800 --> 3:39:17.960]  administration at extraordinary levels how else would one explain the presence of dina habib powell
[3:39:18.600 --> 3:39:28.520]  best friend of valerie jarrett best friend of huma abedin the uh right hand woman and gal powell
[3:39:28.520 --> 3:39:36.760]  and vice chairman of hillary clinton's presidential campaign and then the third bff in this little
[3:39:36.760 --> 3:39:44.840]  group condoleezza rice the failed discredited national security advisor to president george
[3:39:44.840 --> 3:39:53.240]  w bush who helped lie our way into the iraq war dean is a charter member of the council on foreign
[3:39:53.240 --> 3:40:03.240]  relations she is a charter uh former uh employee of the bush white house and she has uh never trump
[3:40:03.240 --> 3:40:12.360]  written all over her why is she in the trump white house why indeed is she now the candidate of
[3:40:12.360 --> 3:40:21.080]  jared kushner uh and his wife avanka trump to be donald trump's next chief of staff talk about
[3:40:21.080 --> 3:40:29.560]  jumping from the frying pan into the fire you have established republican rince previs who has no
[3:40:29.560 --> 3:40:36.120]  idea how trump was elected and does not understand his base constituency in the country and who has
[3:40:36.120 --> 3:40:42.680]  loaded the white house with republican establishment quizlings whose loyalty is not to the president
[3:40:42.680 --> 3:40:49.880]  but to the republican national committee we would go from that to an extreme neocon who throughout
[3:40:49.880 --> 3:40:58.120]  her entire career has opposed everything that donald trump stands for in any event mr rosenstein like
[3:40:58.120 --> 3:41:07.640]  uh miss powell has infiltrated this administration and has taken it upon himself to appoint a special
[3:41:07.640 --> 3:41:15.880]  prosecutor and that special prosecutor mr muller's job is to take down our president again the facts
[3:41:15.880 --> 3:41:24.200]  won't matter slate magazine said when when rosenstein was hired that he would be an adequate check
[3:41:24.200 --> 3:41:30.040]  against the extremely right wing jeff sessions the deep state mouthpiece the washington post
[3:41:30.760 --> 3:41:36.440]  often called the washington compost called rosenstein a fabulous choice for this position
[3:41:37.000 --> 3:41:43.160]  and one that should be completely free of controversy claiming that rosenstein is admired
[3:41:43.160 --> 3:41:50.280]  and respected well when slate and the washington post are praising you you can bet you're an
[3:41:50.280 --> 3:41:58.440]  establishment insider there's other things in mr rosenstein's biography that send up red flags
[3:41:59.240 --> 3:42:06.520]  harvard law never good news the warton school well that's a plus that's where the president went
[3:42:07.480 --> 3:42:14.520]  and then a clerkship in the us court of appeals but as you start digging into mr rosenstein
[3:42:14.520 --> 3:42:24.040]  the picture becomes darker it turns out rosenstein and mr muller go way back in fact to the beginning
[3:42:24.040 --> 3:42:33.160]  of rosenstein's career at the justice department in the 1990s the word crony would not be too strong
[3:42:33.160 --> 3:42:45.000]  and it is absolutely clear that both of these men have firm ties to the deep state both of them
[3:42:46.280 --> 3:42:57.160]  loyal vassals of the bush machine so mr rosenstein went from being the hint selected right out of
[3:42:57.160 --> 3:43:06.120]  harvard deputy to mr muller to his new position in charge of the public integrity section
[3:43:06.680 --> 3:43:13.080]  of the criminal division back in the 90s when he would move on from that job none other than
[3:43:13.080 --> 3:43:20.200]  robert muller now in charge of the false investigation i should say the investigation
[3:43:20.200 --> 3:43:28.440]  into the false russian narrative um and who should appoint mr muller but as i said mr rosenstein
[3:43:29.480 --> 3:43:36.680]  wait it gets better rosenstein then moves on to become a cleanup man for you guessed it bill
[3:43:36.680 --> 3:43:45.240]  and hillary clinton serving as independent counsel from 1995 to 1997 uh mr muller pardon
[3:43:45.240 --> 3:43:52.520]  me not mr rosenstein supervised the investigation and found no purpose uh no criminal prosecution
[3:43:53.160 --> 3:44:00.840]  against white house officials who had rummage through fbi records to get background reports
[3:44:01.400 --> 3:44:11.160]  for the use uh in political blackmail so mr muller has done a great job of covering up for bill
[3:44:11.160 --> 3:44:21.000]  and hillary uh and his service uh like mr comey's goes back to the beginning james comey as we know
[3:44:21.560 --> 3:44:29.160]  gave the clinton's a pass in the sandy burger affair that's when burger stalled national
[3:44:29.160 --> 3:44:35.240]  archives records that would have proved that president bill clinton could have killed osama
[3:44:35.240 --> 3:44:42.280]  bin laden but didn't uh he gave the clinton's a pass in the mark rich case you remember mark rich he
[3:44:42.280 --> 3:44:49.160]  was the international billionaire fugitive who funneled several million dollars to the clinton
[3:44:49.160 --> 3:44:55.560]  foundation in return for a pardon of course prosecutor comey the man who first convicted rich
[3:44:56.200 --> 3:45:03.000]  found no illegality nobody went to jail in fact mr comey goes all the way back to the whitewater
[3:45:03.000 --> 3:45:09.560]  investigation you may not remember whitewater it's a complicated real estate uh matter but
[3:45:09.560 --> 3:45:15.560]  let me put it to you this way no one involved got any money but bill clinton got eight hundred
[3:45:15.560 --> 3:45:21.240]  and fifty thousand dollars with which to finance his comeback tv blitz when he went back to the
[3:45:21.240 --> 3:45:29.880]  governor's office uh and because of the good work of mr comey no one was prosecuted in that
[3:45:29.880 --> 3:45:38.760]  matter either so mr muler mr rozenstein mr comey this is a matched set of cronies whose careers
[3:45:38.760 --> 3:45:48.040]  intersect and that's why i say to you this goose is cooked this is a done deal there will be a
[3:45:48.040 --> 3:45:58.440]  move on our president now sadly this week chris ruddy my friend from newsmax revealed that among
[3:45:58.440 --> 3:46:06.600]  the options he believed the president was looking at was firing mr muler not the worst idea i've
[3:46:06.600 --> 3:46:13.640]  ever had uh that i've ever heard pardon me but i think now that the element of surprise has been
[3:46:13.640 --> 3:46:20.760]  removed uh and that it's probable that that was leaked to mr ruddy uh by some on the white house
[3:46:20.760 --> 3:46:28.920]  staff in an effort to discredit the idea and perhaps to uh preclude from the president that option
[3:46:29.720 --> 3:46:38.520]  my advice to the president begin exposing who muler is today begin exposing his motives today
[3:46:38.520 --> 3:46:45.320]  begin exposing his history today because by the time he makes his phony recommendation
[3:46:45.320 --> 3:46:55.800]  his public credibility will be at an all-time low this is not venezuela this is columbia
[3:46:55.800 --> 3:47:03.640]  if you push patriots too far you are going to and you are going to create a spiral of violence
[3:47:03.640 --> 3:47:10.600]  and insurrection if you jump the rule of law if you cheat to try to remove this president
[3:47:10.600 --> 3:47:18.760]  this country will experience a backlash like you have never seen uh i want to remind you that we
[3:47:18.760 --> 3:47:26.840]  are continuing to have an ongoing fight with the tech left uh and their efforts to kneecap us here
[3:47:26.840 --> 3:47:34.840]  at info wars and frankly at every alternative conservative media outlet manipulating the
[3:47:34.840 --> 3:47:45.720]  algorithms and a dozen other tools being used by amazon by yahoo by twitter by facebook and above
[3:47:45.720 --> 3:47:53.800]  all by google in an effort to stop us from communicating with you and what we need you to do
[3:47:53.800 --> 3:48:01.240]  is to go to the info wars dot com store and support us through your purchase of the many fine
[3:48:01.240 --> 3:48:08.760]  products there i have been pleased with everything i have ever ordered but the standout today for me
[3:48:09.480 --> 3:48:16.920]  is their product prostagard which is 20 off now i can tell you as a red blooded american male over
[3:48:16.920 --> 3:48:25.240]  60 that the plumbing really benefits from a beneficial blend of zinc saw palmetto and a
[3:48:25.240 --> 3:48:33.080]  number of other all natural ingredients which promote urinary tract health this is not a panacea
[3:48:33.080 --> 3:48:41.320]  if you have a problem see a physician but from a prophylactic point of view these natural herbs
[3:48:41.320 --> 3:48:48.120]  that can be found uh in prostagard almost all plant based by the way but also the finest grade
[3:48:48.120 --> 3:48:59.320]  of zinc that you can purchase uh this is i think diriger for any man over the age of 45 and i highly
[3:48:59.320 --> 3:49:05.640]  recommend the win win situation of your going to the info war store buying a product like
[3:49:05.640 --> 3:49:13.480]  prostagard or liver shield for example which is 20 off one of the best detoxifying products
[3:49:13.480 --> 3:49:19.480]  you will find out there something that i used in the period after which i believe i was poisoned

[3:54:27.800 --> 3:54:34.440]  there's chilling new developments in the tech left's war on free speech and on a free open
[3:54:35.400 --> 3:54:40.360]  internet see they want to crack down on the alternative voices that are featured here at
[3:54:40.360 --> 3:54:47.320]  info wars and that you've come to rely on from stone cold truth facebook in accord with its
[3:54:47.320 --> 3:54:58.280]  its diverse strategic plan to eliminate quote fake news has rolled out its latest bag of tools
[3:54:58.840 --> 3:55:06.120]  designed to censor information that arrives in users news feeds that they are uncomfortable with
[3:55:07.320 --> 3:55:15.320]  retweaked algorithms will now filter out clickbait stories that facebook has decided
[3:55:15.320 --> 3:55:23.800]  leave out and exaggerate facts other storylines that facebook finds objectionable will now be tagged
[3:55:23.800 --> 3:55:30.440]  with a disputed label and what about links to web pages that facebook has determined
[3:55:31.000 --> 3:55:37.880]  have little substance or contain disruptive shocking or malicious advertisements such as
[3:55:37.880 --> 3:55:48.680]  shall we say the truth well they will be relegated either entirely off the page or segregated
[3:55:48.680 --> 3:55:58.280]  perpetually at the bottom of the feed with little chance of changing anyone's mind this is the tech
[3:55:58.280 --> 3:56:06.200]  left's idea of free speech chilling leftist foundations were the primary financiers of
[3:56:06.200 --> 3:56:11.560]  this effort sorrows and the ford foundation poured nearly two hundred million dollars
[3:56:11.560 --> 3:56:17.000]  into the coffers of so-called open internet advocates but they too were joined by the
[3:56:17.000 --> 3:56:24.360]  silicon valley monopolies like google and facebook who recognized regulation as further
[3:56:24.360 --> 3:56:31.720]  leveraging their monopoly and their control of the internet self-serving and symbiotic
[3:56:31.720 --> 3:56:38.920]  tech this was a strategy guaranteed to boost their already obscene wealth while advancing
[3:56:38.920 --> 3:56:47.880]  their left-wing godless globalist agenda helped of course the companies like google
[3:56:47.880 --> 3:56:54.520]  owned the obama white house with google officials visiting the white house more than four hundred
[3:56:54.520 --> 3:57:01.800]  and twenty five times with more than two hundred and fifty eight obama administration officials
