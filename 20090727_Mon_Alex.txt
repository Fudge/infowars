[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:31.080]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:31.080 --> 00:37.640]  I tell you folks the establishment is scared to death of the birthers they like
[00:37.640 --> 00:43.400]  to make 911 truthers as the truthers the two fuzz but now they're really scared
[00:43.400 --> 00:50.200]  of the birthers and I've covered this issue some you know back during the
[00:50.200 --> 00:54.880]  campaign and after I've seen it as somewhat of a red herring not that
[00:54.880 --> 00:58.680]  there may not be substance and red meat somewhere there there's just so much
[00:58.680 --> 01:04.440]  smoke I can't find where the fire is but they are acting scared they do have
[01:04.440 --> 01:11.200]  fear in their eyes the body language is it's true the behavior of the president
[01:11.200 --> 01:17.760]  and his minions and his acolytes and his surrogates is that it's true the
[01:17.760 --> 01:21.680]  behavior of his grandmother saying it's true and Kenyan newspaper saying it's
[01:21.680 --> 01:28.400]  true and they're proud of it they directed a shrine in his birthplace now
[01:28.400 --> 01:34.520]  this is overall a distraction from his agenda you know they kind of enjoyed
[01:34.520 --> 01:40.240]  making fun people during the campaign to get off of his actual policies like
[01:40.240 --> 01:45.080]  carbon taxes and socialized health care and open borders and anti-second
[01:45.080 --> 01:51.680]  amendment legislation the list goes on and on that's why the Obama deception
[01:51.680 --> 01:58.160]  doesn't get into his birth certificate now the new film does a little bit and I
[01:58.160 --> 02:03.280]  called to get Phil Berg on today really nice guy lawyer former deputy attorney
[02:03.280 --> 02:08.000]  general in one state and he said why wasn't I on the Obama deception and I
[02:08.000 --> 02:11.080]  said well why don't you be in the new one then we'll just fly a team out to
[02:11.080 --> 02:15.840]  interview you because it is important to look at so Berg's either on the day or
[02:15.840 --> 02:18.840]  tomorrow we want to get him to a landline he's a busy lawyer he is on
[02:18.840 --> 02:23.880]  the day it's set landline one o'clock t-minus two hours you want to be
[02:23.880 --> 02:32.960]  technical one hour 57 minutes 30 seconds exactly on mark and then we've got
[02:32.960 --> 02:40.760]  Reverend James Manning who has made a lot of headlines with his rebukes of
[02:40.760 --> 02:49.640]  Obama so I thought we would have him on to weigh in coming up in the fourth
[02:49.640 --> 02:56.120]  hour today that should be always interesting and informing informative I
[02:56.120 --> 03:01.600]  have a giant important news blitz obviously here in front of me in le09
[03:01.600 --> 03:16.120]  national level exercise 09 is now in full swing it starts today and we'll go
[03:16.120 --> 03:19.360]  over FEMA's original press release in the latest government of Canada
[03:19.360 --> 03:23.480]  participates in major security exercise this put out by marketplace
[03:23.480 --> 03:29.600]  market wire a statement by the Information Office of Canada will tell
[03:29.600 --> 03:34.280]  you about the Canadians the Germans the Israelis the French the Dutch 14
[03:34.280 --> 03:40.640]  different nations participating in a drill to take over the United States in
[03:40.640 --> 03:46.720]  combat American terrorists now you can see my film police day 2000 where you
[03:46.720 --> 03:51.040]  can witness foreign troops in a tabletop exercise training to take over the
[03:51.040 --> 03:55.200]  United States and role players playing the part of US citizens having their
[03:55.200 --> 03:59.640]  firearms confiscated this has been going on for a long time but now they admit
[03:59.640 --> 04:03.640]  it's foreign troops now they admit it's a drill here in the United States that's
[04:03.640 --> 04:09.280]  the difference I'd go to an urban warfare drill in Texas or California or
[04:09.280 --> 04:12.640]  other states we got footage out of Maryland footage out of North Carolina
[04:12.640 --> 04:18.600]  Alabama went to Florida and the troops would openly be training to confiscate
[04:18.600 --> 04:22.960]  our guns and take over city halls and admitting it was for the US they go
[04:22.960 --> 04:26.040]  door-to-door telling neighborhood people before I even got there they've
[04:26.040 --> 04:30.080]  been listening to my phones Alex Jones is coming we have interviews with these
[04:30.080 --> 04:36.600]  people the army knocking door-to-door when he comes don't talk to him boy I
[04:36.600 --> 04:43.440]  tell you that's a real good use of resources there isn't it the US army and
[04:43.440 --> 04:47.360]  their number one enemy I guess Alex Jones of course the troops love me but
[04:47.360 --> 04:51.240]  the establishment the hijacker military know that if I ever wake the troops up
[04:51.240 --> 04:58.240]  it's over for him but then I'd watch CNN and they'd say it was for Iraq or
[04:58.240 --> 05:02.720]  Afghanistan or other countries this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you
[05:02.720 --> 05:06.560]  should consider buying a solar power generator this summer number one new
[05:06.560 --> 05:10.080]  climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[05:10.080 --> 05:14.480]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[05:14.480 --> 05:18.360]  allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in
[05:18.360 --> 05:22.440]  the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of
[05:22.440 --> 05:25.680]  the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded especially with the
[05:25.680 --> 05:29.200]  high-demand summer months ahead number four the hurricane and dangerous summer
[05:29.200 --> 05:32.720]  storms season is here again every year thousands of families lose their power
[05:32.720 --> 05:36.880]  from weather related outages number five a solar power generator provides
[05:36.880 --> 05:40.440]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the
[05:40.440 --> 05:43.800]  solar power generators offered by solutions from science a long-time

[06:17.160 --> 06:21.040]  is working for the best interest of the American people while Obama's already
[06:21.040 --> 06:25.640]  fudging yeah but since day one in this election if you have a demagogue with a
[06:25.640 --> 06:30.320]  fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of
[06:30.320 --> 06:37.720]  a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs that's fascism it's not

[09:17.600 --> 09:23.240]  suppress the american people with an emphasis towards the 14 nations teaming
[09:23.240 --> 09:33.960]  up to surveil and warrantlessly spy on us citizens when i got back from
[09:33.960 --> 09:43.880]  operation urban warrior a similar drill in oakland california 1999 i was shown a
[09:43.880 --> 09:50.480]  video by marines but was not allowed to put it on television of operation death
[09:50.480 --> 10:02.120]  star and operation death star was protesters being followed by unmanned
[10:02.120 --> 10:08.960]  aerial vehicles by the marine corps so you have a drill with the marine corps
[10:08.960 --> 10:17.160]  and french dutch israeli british scottish australian german and other
[10:17.160 --> 10:21.960]  troops training to take over the city role-players screaming i'm an american
[10:21.960 --> 10:26.280]  no not the camp mock police arresting citizens doing mock executions of the
[10:26.280 --> 10:31.120]  marines all on video interrogating the citizens where'd you get the gun where'd
[10:31.120 --> 10:35.720]  you get the helmet where are you from san francisco then you'd see the marine
[10:35.720 --> 10:42.480]  corps spokesman the civilian mr. jones would run in steve jones's name tell me
[10:42.480 --> 10:45.560]  turn the camera off you can't film this part he kept getting matter and matter
[10:45.560 --> 10:49.800]  but we were given authorization by his higher ups to go in and cover the event
[10:49.800 --> 10:55.320]  then we got thrown out but they were also let giving citizen tours of the
[10:55.320 --> 11:00.160]  drills and then so we sent our people in his quote just regular tourist and i
[11:00.160 --> 11:06.280]  got the most damning footage but job because they had a university area shut
[11:06.280 --> 11:09.280]  down that we're doing in that part of oakland but they also practice occupying
[11:09.280 --> 11:18.320]  some of the bridges and some of the railheads and ports and then i'd watch
[11:18.320 --> 11:22.920]  national news in my hotel room at night on cnn they'd say marines are training
[11:22.920 --> 11:29.080]  in oakland to help in the peacekeeping operation in massed onia and in
[11:29.080 --> 11:35.600]  Serbia and kosovo and in a way that was true from a lawyer speak because it did
[11:35.600 --> 11:43.120]  have dual use but all of that is going on right now in the united states it's
[11:43.120 --> 11:47.480]  going on in arizona and it's going on in michigan and it's going on in florida
[11:47.480 --> 11:51.160]  and they've in the last two months had buildups to this and the mammy heralds
[11:51.160 --> 11:56.640]  had the photos of troops from 12 nations of latin america land flying their
[11:56.640 --> 12:01.680]  flags for the first time in u.s. history and mexican troops aid in drills in
[12:01.680 --> 12:06.960]  south texas bearing their flag and and loaded weapons for the first time since
[12:06.960 --> 12:16.200]  the mexican-american war and dutch troops land in michigan and japanese
[12:16.200 --> 12:23.400]  troops assist check republic troops in san diego it's all over the news today
[12:23.400 --> 12:28.080]  oh look they're landing with you in flags in america
[12:28.080 --> 12:32.560]  oh look the foreign a waxer in the sky
[12:32.960 --> 12:38.240]  then i was shown video of operation death starb
[12:39.280 --> 12:43.840]  and i was shown video of us coming out of our hotel in the morning and getting
[12:43.840 --> 12:47.760]  in our ford torus and driving over to the drills
[12:47.760 --> 12:52.400]  so see during the live drill thousands of marines and other troops from other
[12:52.400 --> 12:55.200]  countries but the u.s. marine court leading it
[12:55.200 --> 12:58.720]  they had not just the trainees in the big drill but the
[12:58.720 --> 13:01.760]  higher level units that had already been trained previously
[13:01.760 --> 13:07.360]  watching us and other people and i was only allowed to see about 10 minutes of
[13:07.360 --> 13:11.520]  this and begged for it was told no and it was then they had
[13:11.520 --> 13:15.760]  during the drill other marines in plain clothes
[13:15.760 --> 13:19.440]  practicing landing dingy boats and loading
[13:19.440 --> 13:26.320]  wmds in the back of a moving truck in oakland and another one in san francisco
[13:26.320 --> 13:30.000]  an operation death star this is only one part of it
[13:30.000 --> 13:34.000]  operation death star with the drones watching them
[13:34.000 --> 13:38.000]  again casting the militias the u.s. gun owners
[13:38.000 --> 13:41.680]  as the terrorist
[13:42.240 --> 13:46.640]  so during operation urban warrior in 1999 the marines were running classified
[13:46.640 --> 13:52.000]  ops like operation death star
[13:54.320 --> 14:02.640]  operation death star and death star was looking down on us
[14:02.640 --> 14:12.080]  that was 1999 10 years ago 10 years ago
[14:12.080 --> 14:21.520]  fast forward to november 22nd in the fed demonstrations in 38 locations
[14:21.520 --> 14:27.280]  ron paul in houston is giving a speech i'm giving a speech in dalis at the fed
[14:27.280 --> 14:31.760]  with ron paul's brother wane paul and i get sent a secret
[14:31.760 --> 14:36.000]  document from the army people inside the army that aren't that were upset
[14:36.000 --> 14:39.840]  listing us as terrorists and saying we were being watched at all 38 locations
[14:39.840 --> 14:44.160]  this is out of the texas office specifically that we were being watched
[14:44.160 --> 14:47.280]  and did not let us know that they were army
[14:47.280 --> 14:51.680]  because we were terrorist and might kill them
[14:51.680 --> 14:55.600]  again casting me and ron paul and his brother
[14:55.600 --> 15:02.240]  as like the murdering gremlins or as deadly as the money python
[15:02.240 --> 15:07.120]  holy grail rabbit that chews everyone's throats out i mean i was just like i am
[15:07.120 --> 15:11.840]  this little fuzzy sweet thing but if you let me know you're the army
[15:11.840 --> 15:16.160]  watching me i may rip your throat out ron paul may rip your
[15:16.160 --> 15:19.680]  throat out you know i'm there with my camera
[15:19.680 --> 15:23.360]  with a 35 millimeter around my neck and a video camera in my hand at urban
[15:23.360 --> 15:29.040]  warrior and i've got to have hover drones following me around
[15:29.040 --> 15:34.400]  because i'm as deadly as the guardian of the grail the
[15:34.400 --> 15:37.680]  one-pound white rabbit
[15:38.480 --> 15:41.920]  it is ridiculous if you haven't seen that money python
[15:41.920 --> 15:47.120]  you don't know what i'm talking about the guardian of the holy grail the little
[15:47.120 --> 15:52.320]  rabbit viciously chews everybody's throats out but the holy hand grenade
[15:52.320 --> 15:54.880]  takes him out
[15:56.880 --> 16:00.640]  the issue here is this is ridiculous so
[16:00.640 --> 16:04.480]  they're casting us as the enemy and then remember what three weeks ago in fact
[16:04.480 --> 16:09.520]  i was looking for it in my stack out there guys it was in
[16:09.520 --> 16:13.200]  i forget which missouri paper but that it was written by the army we now have
[16:13.200 --> 16:17.840]  local liaison army officers in the police departments and in the papers
[16:17.840 --> 16:21.280]  assigned to local papers and the papers were under staff they like having a
[16:21.280 --> 16:25.040]  army captain i was written by an army captain
[16:25.040 --> 16:28.640]  and he's telling everybody oh uh what was the headline
[16:28.640 --> 16:35.520]  uh exact headline was militias national guard
[16:35.520 --> 16:39.360]  drills for militia attack
[16:41.040 --> 16:45.840]  on checkpoint or was it national guard drills for militia attack
[16:45.840 --> 16:50.640]  missouri that that'll get it i see as i'm here talking i have thousands of
[16:50.640 --> 16:55.040]  pieces of proof hundreds in the last month and they had those drills in
[16:55.040 --> 16:59.040]  iowa where they were doing door to door gun confiscation drills the newspaper
[16:59.040 --> 17:02.160]  said that it had the army sergeant saying yeah we're
[17:02.160 --> 17:07.600]  going to do a gun drill door to door and uh then i was the bad one though in the
[17:07.600 --> 17:10.480]  local paper when i reported it and read what the paper said
[17:10.480 --> 17:13.920]  that the that the that the army was going to go door to door
[17:13.920 --> 17:17.920]  and was doing a drill of a shutting down a gun shop owner who'd sold illegal
[17:17.920 --> 17:22.640]  guns to locals a door to door gun checkpoint and then we have real
[17:22.640 --> 17:26.160]  knock and talk drills all over the country
[17:26.160 --> 17:29.360]  where they just come and ask to search your house and look at your guns and
[17:29.360 --> 17:32.320]  the illinois governor gets on tv and says we're going to use the army
[17:32.320 --> 17:37.680]  for door to door gun confiscation but then the barack obama people say you
[17:37.680 --> 17:39.920]  know don't worry about it it's no big deal
[17:39.920 --> 17:42.880]  and then after i gave you the secret army document
[17:42.880 --> 17:46.960]  for the last in the fed demonstrations a few months ago it was in the boltamore
[17:46.960 --> 17:54.480]  sun headline boltamore sun that go ahead and give me that one
[17:54.480 --> 17:58.800]  army watching tea parties that was the one but but when you read the article
[17:58.800 --> 18:03.280]  was actually in the fed demonstrations now here is news tribune
[18:03.280 --> 18:10.240]  out of missouri camp crowded missouri and uh you can go there it's written by a

[26:13.600 --> 26:19.840]  and north com trucks driving around in fact i had that sent to paul watson and
[26:19.840 --> 26:22.400]  curt nemo but they wrote big articles this morning they haven't gotten around
[26:22.400 --> 26:27.280]  to it yet maybe i'll have uh erin or somebody just post the
[26:27.280 --> 26:33.520]  video but uh that's going on i mean it's
[26:33.520 --> 26:36.800]  just everywhere so i'm going to open the phones up now
[26:36.800 --> 26:41.520]  on three subjects and three subjects only
[26:41.520 --> 26:45.280]  okay and i'm asking listeners to stick to these subjects so we can focus in on
[26:45.280 --> 26:48.000]  them so i can get callers on these subjects because
[26:48.000 --> 26:52.640]  if we don't limit the subject sometimes i can't get the calls on those subjects
[26:52.640 --> 26:56.400]  because the phones fill up with people just want to plug their websites or
[26:56.400 --> 27:00.480]  talk about how i'm a reptoid or whatever so
[27:00.480 --> 27:05.280]  we can talk about the flu and the incredible height that the media is
[27:05.280 --> 27:08.160]  engaged in right now basically saying it's the end of the world

[27:22.320 --> 27:27.840]  flu is already mutated but so what i want to talk about all things flew
[27:27.840 --> 27:31.920]  because this is looking worse and worse this is looking bad
[27:31.920 --> 27:35.760]  not that it's even a real threat itself but the vaccine and the forced
[27:35.760 --> 27:40.560]  inoculation also in le09 i want to discuss that
[27:40.560 --> 27:45.920]  and barack obama all things barack obama his approval rating of now dropping
[27:45.920 --> 27:50.080]  below 50 points rasmussen they are in major spin
[27:50.080 --> 27:55.280]  control they are panicked they are afraid uh this is really
[27:55.280 --> 27:58.960]  stalling on them faster than they even predicted you know they said they had
[27:58.960 --> 28:02.240]  200 days or so
[28:02.240 --> 28:06.000]  we're now 150 days into this and they are in complete
[28:06.000 --> 28:12.000]  and total panic mode they are really starting to figure it out now
[28:12.000 --> 28:15.040]  that the public isn't buying any of their propaganda and i want to break some
[28:15.040 --> 28:19.440]  of that down after the break here's some of the other flu news

[28:22.960 --> 28:26.960]  maker payroll well of course they all are
[28:26.960 --> 28:30.080]  and let's just hope it's fair mongering to sell tens of millions in deadly
[28:30.080 --> 28:34.160]  vaccine that's bad enough let's really hope
[28:34.160 --> 28:37.680]  they don't know something about this manufactured virus and it's admitted
[28:37.680 --> 28:40.640]  it's made in a lab that that we don't know and that they know it's going to
[28:40.640 --> 28:44.800]  mutate into something mega death but they're saying that's going to happen
[28:44.800 --> 28:50.240]  let's hope that's not the case uh also another report here uh new york

[32:27.920 --> 32:32.320]  if you're tired of being tired you need to pick up robber beetle's new book
[32:32.320 --> 32:36.320]  and it's called here's what you do yes here's what you do

[32:40.400 --> 32:44.320]  that's in the middle of a recession and the best part this revolutionary book
[32:44.320 --> 32:48.560]  is priced under ten dollars and is only six dollars for the e-book
[32:48.560 --> 32:51.120]  here's what you do to get here's what you do
[32:51.120 --> 32:55.440]  visit here's what you do net that's here's what you do net

[32:59.120 --> 33:09.120]  today
[33:09.120 --> 33:20.880]  tell all the folks to run it up and try to do don't you know that it's time to get on
[33:20.880 --> 33:29.200]  go and let this train keep on riding riding on
[33:29.200 --> 33:33.520]  yeah we want to love train but the globalists don't
[33:33.520 --> 33:40.880]  and they've got a swiss army knife of stage prices and false flags
[33:42.240 --> 33:45.120]  you know it's not another issue but i've got to do a show on this in the near
[33:45.120 --> 33:52.320]  future on persistent jet contrails aerosol sprays chemtrails as they're
[33:52.320 --> 33:58.400]  known the cub common name for them
[33:58.400 --> 34:03.760]  because there is no doubt i've had meteorologists on
[34:03.760 --> 34:06.960]  like the guy from weather wars
[34:07.760 --> 34:11.200]  and been living stend the father of weather weapons meteorologists on
[34:11.200 --> 34:14.960]  and others there is no doubt they're already manipulating the weather
[34:14.960 --> 34:18.640]  secretary of defense cohen in 97 said they were
[34:18.640 --> 34:23.120]  bill gates is patenting and being allowed to patent all these technologies that
[34:23.120 --> 34:28.160]  the government certified worked in 1967 stanford research institute
[34:28.160 --> 34:32.320]  see that's what bill gates is they just give him existing technologies
[34:32.320 --> 34:36.640]  and then he's just a government clandestine operative
[34:36.640 --> 34:39.920]  a fake ceo
[34:40.400 --> 34:44.080]  and i have been talking about that for a decade now that's come out in mainstream
[34:44.080 --> 34:48.000]  news that most these big ceos are just complete operatives
[34:48.000 --> 34:51.520]  they're complete fronts that's why they always give
[34:51.520 --> 34:55.520]  you know 90 plus percent of their money tens of billions
[34:55.520 --> 34:59.840]  to eugenics because that's state department random 200
[34:59.840 --> 35:08.320]  that is official policy from 1973 it's official british policy from 1949 on
[35:09.360 --> 35:13.040]  so this is what they do and the government can't
[35:13.040 --> 35:17.520]  openly own every corporation and every bank and every system
[35:17.520 --> 35:21.360]  at least they couldn't back on the 40s 50 60 70s now they just do it in the name
[35:21.360 --> 35:24.800]  of the economy and grab gm and chrysler and everything else but it's
[35:24.800 --> 35:28.160]  all part of continuity of government all part of
[35:28.160 --> 35:31.280]  infrastructure protection
[35:32.000 --> 35:35.840]  it's just a complete takeover you know that's the issue there's just billions
[35:35.840 --> 35:40.240]  of points i want to make it is like a giant 3d hologram
[35:40.240 --> 35:44.560]  false reality projected out and you can go into every little area of the
[35:44.560 --> 35:48.720]  hologram and zoom in on every little piece of it
[35:48.720 --> 35:55.360]  and see that it is a manufactured false reality
[35:55.360 --> 35:59.840]  you know we always use the analogy of saying pull back
[35:59.840 --> 36:03.360]  and you can see the big picture and that's one way to look at it yes most
[36:03.360 --> 36:08.800]  people are so focused on their little petty system and petty desires and
[36:08.800 --> 36:11.920]  they don't have respect for themselves and they just kind of accept
[36:11.920 --> 36:19.600]  whatever is laid out before them like rats in a maze
[36:19.600 --> 36:23.280]  but there's another way to look at that that people
[36:23.280 --> 36:29.600]  are looking at this projected matrix from far away
[36:29.600 --> 36:36.720]  in in the backseat of the movie theater they're not really paying attention
[36:36.720 --> 36:42.160]  but if you walk right up to the movie screen
[36:43.680 --> 36:48.320]  you can see the pixels of the projector if it's a digital projector and that's
[36:48.320 --> 36:52.320]  almost how it is you can go up to any area of society any area of
[36:52.320 --> 36:55.760]  government anything that's just accepted knowledge accepted
[36:55.760 --> 36:59.280]  reality and if you go zoom in on it you'll see
[36:59.280 --> 37:03.920]  incredible design new world order handiwork it's like matrix code or
[37:03.920 --> 37:10.480]  something is a good parable a good way to
[37:10.480 --> 37:13.120]  boil it down
[37:14.320 --> 37:18.160]  and you find out they've got cia and regular army in every major city in
[37:18.160 --> 37:21.280]  town you find out they've got pentagon design control
[37:21.280 --> 37:24.720]  grids you find out the entire technological system we
[37:24.720 --> 37:28.400]  live under for at least 40 years has been designed
[37:28.400 --> 37:32.560]  to control every facet of our lives
[37:32.560 --> 37:36.000]  you find out they are poisoning the water and food you find out they are
[37:36.000 --> 37:40.320]  engineering the society completely and it just makes your head spin
[37:40.320 --> 37:46.480]  at least it does mine okay i said i want to get to your phone calls
[37:47.760 --> 37:49.840]  and i've got so much here i'm kind of going in a hundred different
[37:49.840 --> 37:52.800]  directions i'm going to just take calls till the
[37:52.800 --> 37:57.440]  bottom of the next hour and then i'm going to get into n le09 in
[37:57.440 --> 38:00.560]  some detail i'm going to get into the flu situation
[38:00.560 --> 38:03.760]  that the picture is very clear now they are moving
[38:03.760 --> 38:07.920]  this is a massive operation this is a staged operation
[38:07.920 --> 38:11.440]  specifically what the end game is is not clear
[38:11.440 --> 38:15.280]  but we've got three to four different scenarios
[38:15.280 --> 38:19.760]  three that are their scenarios one scenario we can force
[38:19.760 --> 38:26.000]  that is them pulling out we know it's one of three bad scenarios
[38:26.000 --> 38:31.760]  we know it's an operation and we know all three of these scenarios are bad
[38:31.760 --> 38:34.960]  news bad news and each one gets worse than the
[38:34.960 --> 38:38.480]  next and then there's a fourth scenario we can
[38:38.480 --> 38:42.160]  force to get us out of this and it'll be bad but there'll
[38:42.160 --> 38:46.560]  be collateral damage with the idiots still taking the vaccine a lot of them
[38:46.560 --> 38:49.040]  but you can't help them i mean you can try to warn them
[38:49.040 --> 38:53.040]  not to go into the gas chambers not to get on the trains
[38:53.040 --> 38:59.120]  that's basically what this is but it's a camouflage soft kill weapon
[38:59.120 --> 39:02.960]  it's like a woman called in at the end of the show yesterday
[39:02.960 --> 39:06.320]  and she was talking about how she told her daughter don't give our granddaughter
[39:06.320 --> 39:10.880]  the uh Gardasil merc shot and she gave it to her
[39:10.880 --> 39:14.400]  and then she got the bloody spots all over and and now has an autoimmune
[39:14.400 --> 39:17.520]  disease and it's clear that's what the vaccine's
[39:17.520 --> 39:21.520]  designed to do because that's what it does
[39:21.520 --> 39:24.480]  and some people are even more susceptible and the soft kill just goes
[39:24.480 --> 39:28.720]  ahead and becomes a hard kill and kills them immediately
[39:28.720 --> 39:32.560]  and by the way i don't do this with enjoyment abc news has reported
[39:32.560 --> 39:36.560]  that merc quote has hit teams and seek and destroy teams
[39:36.560 --> 39:39.360]  that came out in federal documents in a federal lawsuit
[39:39.360 --> 39:44.160]  to quote go to people's homes and eliminate them
[39:44.160 --> 39:48.480]  and the media spun that two months ago is oh they meant that figuratively
[39:48.480 --> 39:53.360]  no they don't mean that figuratively i don't enjoy going up against merc
[39:53.360 --> 39:55.920]  i mean if they'll shoot little girls up with something they know is going to
[39:55.920 --> 40:00.400]  kill them you know the only reason they don't kill me
[40:00.400 --> 40:04.320]  is because they don't want to put a big giant
[40:04.320 --> 40:08.400]  underline under all the work i do but believe me this isn't fun
[40:08.400 --> 40:12.320]  i'm doing this because i got to warn people
[40:12.320 --> 40:15.600]  and i've got a passion to get on more am and fm stations and shortwave and
[40:15.600 --> 40:20.160]  satellite and internet to warn these people i care about people folks
[40:20.160 --> 40:23.520]  i want to just walk up to people in restaurants and in
[40:23.520 --> 40:27.280]  shopping malls and in grocery stores and on the street and say please don't
[40:27.280 --> 40:30.720]  vaccinate your children please please don't give your daughter
[40:30.720 --> 40:33.680]  Gardasil you have such an innocent lovely sweet
[40:33.680 --> 40:35.760]  daughter and now they want to force it on boys
[40:35.760 --> 40:40.880]  you have such a good handsome smart son he's got such potential and such
[40:40.880 --> 40:44.720]  destiny in his eyes please don't let him soft kill your son
[40:44.720 --> 40:48.960]  but i know they're preconditioned slave minds and they just aren't ready for it
[40:48.960 --> 40:52.960]  because that is crazy sounding it is crazy to have holdren running around
[40:52.960 --> 40:56.480]  writing 1100 page textbooks about how to put poison in the water
[40:56.480 --> 41:01.520]  but it's real man don't you understand this isn't a game
[41:01.520 --> 41:04.480]  it's real they've got ukrainian troops running checkpoints
[41:04.480 --> 41:08.080]  in scotland and it's real they're going to have unannounced checkpoints we're
[41:08.080 --> 41:11.360]  already getting reports of them where police pull you over and then foreign
[41:11.360 --> 41:15.840]  troops come over and search you it's dog training it's like training a puppy
[41:15.840 --> 41:19.440]  how to bird hunt they're just getting them all
[41:19.440 --> 41:22.720]  geared up this is sick they're trampling all over us
[41:22.720 --> 41:26.320]  and doing simulated foreign troop flag planting
[41:26.320 --> 41:30.800]  on our country it's real folks i've been there
[41:30.800 --> 41:34.640]  i've witnessed marines training to put american citizens on their knees
[41:34.640 --> 41:38.240]  and shoot you in the back of the head
[41:38.240 --> 41:43.440]  it's just so real
[41:43.520 --> 41:47.840]  and it almost lessens it that i even do a radio show that i even have sponsors
[41:47.840 --> 41:53.120]  and and and joke around with my producers and but i'm a human i've got a
[41:53.120 --> 41:56.320]  i'm like everybody else i like to joke around i like to have fun i like to go
[41:56.320 --> 41:59.360]  out to eat i like to go to movies i like to go hunting
[41:59.360 --> 42:07.520]  i like to live but that is a sick response to this
[42:07.520 --> 42:11.600]  you can't you can't go on through your life
[42:11.600 --> 42:15.200]  like anything else matters when you know they're poisoned in the water in the
[42:15.200 --> 42:19.760]  food and got weather weapons systems causing droughts admittedly
[42:19.760 --> 42:23.360]  now you do have to compartmentalize a little bit and have some r and r but
[42:23.360 --> 42:27.280]  when you're r and r-ing admit to yourself i'm compartmentalizing and
[42:27.280 --> 42:30.160]  going out and having some fun and ignoring what else is going on
[42:30.160 --> 42:35.440]  because it is sick see what happens is the people been trained to compartmentalize
[42:35.440 --> 42:39.040]  the real serious issues and compartmentalize them to a point where
[42:39.040 --> 42:43.120]  they don't even care and it doesn't even exist to where it's like a tiny
[42:43.120 --> 42:47.680]  pinpoint of reality in your life you need to expand that pinpoint
[42:47.680 --> 42:51.440]  to where the r and r is a small area of your life
[42:51.440 --> 42:55.600]  and the petty issues and the things that don't matter
[42:55.600 --> 42:59.440]  are a small part of your life and you gotta have it
[42:59.440 --> 43:03.040]  i do everything i can you know a couple times a year to take a few days off and
[43:03.040 --> 43:07.680]  go lay out in the sun and go fish in and you know swim around
[43:07.680 --> 43:14.480]  and and body surf or boogie board and and it feeds the soul and you need to do
[43:14.480 --> 43:19.760]  it or to get out of canvas and you know do an oil painting spend a few hours but
[43:19.760 --> 43:22.960]  i've gone to the extreme point and not even really doing that because every
[43:22.960 --> 43:26.560]  minute is so precious every minute i'm even alive to be here
[43:26.560 --> 43:36.320]  warning you is so precious
[43:36.320 --> 43:42.320]  and all i'm saying is we got to get our priority straight ladies and gentlemen
[43:42.320 --> 43:47.040]  we got to get our priority straight and we got a scientific dictatorship coming
[43:47.040 --> 43:51.120]  down on us and whether you're an auto mechanic or a dentist or a doctor or a
[43:51.120 --> 43:54.320]  school teacher or a refinery worker or a rough
[43:54.320 --> 43:58.640]  neck out in the oil fields or whether you are a janitor
[43:58.640 --> 44:03.040]  whether you are a truck driver it doesn't matter whether you're a professional
[44:03.040 --> 44:09.920]  baseball player or a hollywood movie star 99.99 percent of us
[44:09.920 --> 44:14.160]  i don't know guys do some division for me in there on the calculator
[44:14.160 --> 44:17.200]  roth cop the head of the kissinger group who we interviewed
[44:17.200 --> 44:20.080]  he came on saying oh we want to talk to your audience yeah we know you are mr
[44:20.080 --> 44:23.440]  jones you know we're we want a world government we want to go ahead and talk
[44:23.440 --> 44:26.320]  to you we believe the world government's the way to go
[44:26.320 --> 44:29.600]  he won't come back on now he didn't like how i thrashed him on air we tried to
[44:29.600 --> 44:32.400]  have him back on but he wrote a big article for the washington post saying
[44:32.400 --> 44:37.280]  we're the superclass 6000 of us rule the planet for 20 families
[44:37.280 --> 44:44.000]  and that's about right so what is 6000 divided into six and a half billion
[44:44.000 --> 44:48.960]  because that's the numbers you may get a lot of money and a lot of power millions
[44:48.960 --> 44:52.240]  a year out of serving these bastards they're still putting sodium fluoride
[44:52.240 --> 44:57.120]  and a hundred plus other poisons in your water on purpose
[44:57.120 --> 45:02.880]  they're still spraying stuff into the air that causes neuro neurodegenerative
[45:02.880 --> 45:06.480]  diseases in the brain they are still genetically engineering the food
[45:06.480 --> 45:09.920]  crops in every study they've done to sterilize
[45:09.920 --> 45:14.560]  and reduce the fertility of all mammal species
[45:14.560 --> 45:19.120]  they've turned your regular food crops into pharmacological crops
[45:19.120 --> 45:23.440]  that cause hormonal fluctuations and balances there's a lot of different
[45:23.440 --> 45:26.640]  attack profiles we've proven with top geneticists here on the show
[45:26.640 --> 45:30.640]  you know that's going on and i'm sorry once you realize that
[45:30.640 --> 45:34.240]  the peer pressure of being in the cop shop and you know dealing with the
[45:34.240 --> 45:39.280]  dirty citizens all day it's over you're in the same boat with us
[45:39.280 --> 45:43.440]  you're some local government pimp getting side contracts and stealing money
[45:43.440 --> 45:46.560]  to do what the bankers say
[45:46.560 --> 45:50.400]  does that fancy house and the big bank account mean crap
[45:50.400 --> 45:53.760]  next to the fact that your kids at the doctor every week and has health problems
[45:53.760 --> 45:57.360]  or the fact that your 20 year old daughter has got thyroid problems almost
[45:57.360 --> 46:00.400]  every woman i've talked to has got their hair fallen out
[46:00.400 --> 46:04.720]  and doesn't even eat food but are overweight they all got thyroid problems
[46:04.720 --> 46:06.640]  because of what you're being fed and what you're eating and what they're
[46:06.640 --> 46:12.320]  spraying on you i mean is this really fun do you really like this
[46:12.320 --> 46:18.320]  all the money all the fake fame doesn't mean anything if you don't know what the
[46:18.320 --> 46:21.680]  real reality is and if you don't if you aren't the driver's seat of your
[46:21.680 --> 46:25.040]  destiny and i'm telling you these six thousand
[46:25.040 --> 46:29.200]  scumbags we have the math six thousand divided into uh
[46:29.200 --> 46:33.120]  six million five hundred million
[46:34.320 --> 46:37.840]  do the math ladies and gentlemen
[46:37.840 --> 46:44.720]  99.999 i would imagine is what the number is going to come out to
[46:48.240 --> 46:52.320]  i mean we are all here being dumbed down and we spend all our time watching tv
[46:52.320 --> 46:56.160]  and sucked into the computers and sucked into
[46:57.040 --> 47:00.480]  this false reality the point of we can hardly communicate with each other
[47:00.480 --> 47:05.280]  anymore we can hardly do math we can hardly spell or write anymore all of us
[47:05.280 --> 47:09.200]  we're wrecks the elite have wrecked us through their eugenics
[47:09.200 --> 47:13.920]  to make us defenseless so they can have their way with us
[47:18.880 --> 47:22.560]  let's go ahead and take some calls and i'm gonna go through it all later
[47:22.560 --> 47:26.240]  jason in washington you're on the air
[47:27.760 --> 47:34.480]  okay he hung up d in minnesota you're on the air d go ahead hi alex go ahead
[47:34.480 --> 47:38.640]  do you love your show thank you i guess this is have to do with two out of your
[47:38.640 --> 47:43.760]  three things obama's one of them and the flu things another one
[47:43.760 --> 47:47.680]  the flu thing i don't know this is kind of repping reminiscing the 2001 they
[47:47.680 --> 47:53.440]  had a big old flu scare and then of course we had 9 11 that fall
[47:53.440 --> 47:56.400]  i'm kind of wondering if that ain't a possibility somewhere
[47:56.400 --> 47:59.840]  you know what the false you're not gonna hang on
[47:59.840 --> 48:04.720]  given that they're talking about attacking aran or letting israel do it
[48:04.720 --> 48:09.440]  i just kind of i i think something big is going to happen and it might be
[48:09.440 --> 48:13.520]  it'll have to be bigger than 9 11 yeah i thought that was a question that's why
[48:13.520 --> 48:17.600]  i was chiming in um no i mean those are great points what's your
[48:17.600 --> 48:22.080]  point on obama um i got woke up through ralph mader
[48:22.080 --> 48:27.040]  just before the election actually a biden kind of woke me up on my own
[48:27.040 --> 48:30.400]  the whole thing started with the israeli palestinian issue but when i
[48:30.400 --> 48:35.600]  researched it and traced it it goes back to the same eugenesis and the whole
[48:35.600 --> 48:39.280]  come the rough child and the rock sellers and the rest of them
[48:39.280 --> 48:42.720]  it all ties back there everything that ties into that
[48:42.720 --> 48:46.480]  yeah and that's how i got woke up to you with starting researching that israeli
[48:46.480 --> 48:52.000]  palestinian conflict and then this holding guy and people
[48:52.000 --> 48:56.560]  are so do the sheeple thing because i think that just describes a lot of the
[48:56.560 --> 49:03.520]  public obama like you do it obama obama what they do
[49:03.520 --> 49:08.080]  what they do is they rationalize and like a child and ma'am i appreciate your
[49:08.080 --> 49:16.880]  call good to hear from you great points d
[49:16.880 --> 49:23.280]  um yeah this is a very very important point
[49:23.280 --> 49:30.480]  a three-year-old girl or boy will dress up a little boy will dress up like
[49:30.480 --> 49:34.320]  space captain or like a star wars person and a little girl will dress up like a
[49:34.320 --> 49:37.760]  princess and put a little plastic crown on it's you know the little girl's loved
[49:37.760 --> 49:41.200]  it's very popular and they will believe their princess
[49:41.200 --> 49:45.760]  while they're walking around with plastic jewels on
[49:45.760 --> 49:49.680]  and i liken that to adults you're supposed to make believe and have
[49:49.680 --> 49:54.640]  imaginary friends and be delusional when you're a child
[49:54.640 --> 50:00.880]  but by the time i was three and a half i was aware that that was delusion
[50:00.880 --> 50:04.880]  to imagine i was batman jumping around on my back porch with my friend
[50:04.880 --> 50:09.440]  batman and robin and other kids thought i was weird because i didn't really want
[50:09.440 --> 50:14.160]  to pretend anymore because i'd i figured out it wasn't real
[50:14.160 --> 50:17.760]  but see i've adults are engaged in delusion they just think if they say
[50:17.760 --> 50:22.320]  oh they're not putting poison in my water that it suddenly is not there
[50:22.320 --> 50:25.680]  or they all they're not gonna stage a terror attack governments don't stage
[50:25.680 --> 50:28.320]  terror attacks doesn't matter if you hand them a stack of mainstream news
[50:28.320 --> 50:31.280]  articles where it's declassified they do
[50:31.280 --> 50:36.320]  they believe that if they just say reality is one way that makes it that way
[50:36.320 --> 50:40.800]  they're delusional and they're they're so selfish they don't even save
[50:40.800 --> 50:44.640]  themselves they're so selfish and delusional they just lie to themselves
[50:44.640 --> 50:48.480]  and that is one of the biggest issues bird man george bill and many others

[55:01.360 --> 55:05.840]  test balloons to see if we'll buy it and if they don't get resistance to it
[55:05.840 --> 55:09.920]  they expand it and yes we are under
[55:09.920 --> 55:16.800]  martial law when 99 percent of the american people

[56:06.160 --> 56:09.600]  tasers that's why they've been told crack down the public let them know your
[56:09.600 --> 56:16.000]  boss that's why they're putting cia and regular army into every local

[1:01:24.000 --> 1:01:26.880]  and didn't give a source but that's why i try to neurodically
[1:01:26.880 --> 1:01:30.240]  some people complain and say i stopped too much and give sources
[1:01:30.240 --> 1:01:34.480]  and it does kind of break the flow i'm a decent orator decent talk show host but
[1:01:34.480 --> 1:01:37.920]  half the time now i'm just sourcing sourcing sourcing
[1:01:37.920 --> 1:01:41.280]  because when i get up here and tell you the white house science are openly says
[1:01:41.280 --> 1:01:44.320]  he wants to poison the water to sterilize you and reduce the world's
[1:01:44.320 --> 1:01:47.200]  population and bring in world government to enforce it
[1:01:47.200 --> 1:01:51.600]  i mean we we write articles and scan the book and link to it and

[1:01:55.440 --> 1:01:59.200]  number one terror threat and homeland security set up to take them on and
[1:01:59.200 --> 1:02:01.760]  we link to new york times articles where they're training

[1:02:26.080 --> 1:02:31.680]  ron paul stripe and i got an education from listeners
[1:02:31.680 --> 1:02:34.720]  i knew about the new world order and the global banks and things but i didn't
[1:02:34.720 --> 1:02:39.200]  know how deep the rabbit hole went i kind of ignored the quote french stuff like
[1:02:39.200 --> 1:02:42.640]  black helicopters because i heard the media say anybody that talks about
[1:02:42.640 --> 1:02:46.240]  military drills is insane and then they started
[1:02:46.240 --> 1:02:50.480]  blowing up buildings and terrorizing and shooting into buildings and crashing
[1:02:50.480 --> 1:02:55.120]  in houston and trying to pay off city managers and police chiefs and i i went
[1:02:55.120 --> 1:02:58.480]  and interviewed a police chief in san antonio of san antonio and
[1:02:58.480 --> 1:03:01.680]  i went and reviewed emergency managers and city managers and they said yeah
[1:03:01.680 --> 1:03:05.280]  foreign troops are here doing gun confiscation drills but i'm not allowed
[1:03:05.280 --> 1:03:09.120]  to tell you anymore and i'd go on air and talk about it and play
[1:03:09.120 --> 1:03:12.960]  interviews with police chiefs and mayors and city managers and i'd get
[1:03:12.960 --> 1:03:16.160]  made fun of by the local austin american statesman
[1:03:16.160 --> 1:03:21.120]  would say i was insane that didn't exist
[1:03:21.120 --> 1:03:25.200]  and i said well what else is the media saying it in real that is
[1:03:25.200 --> 1:03:29.680]  and let me tell you listen to me police drive them along your squad car right
[1:03:29.680 --> 1:03:33.120]  now do you like somebody putting over a hundred chemicals in your
[1:03:33.120 --> 1:03:36.880]  in your water to brain damage you you think that's funny and cute and you
[1:03:36.880 --> 1:03:40.000]  think i'm making that up go ahead and laugh at your own peril

[1:04:33.680 --> 1:04:37.680]  a bunch of control freak scientists financed by bankers
[1:04:37.680 --> 1:04:40.800]  playing god on us and we're all in the same boat together
[1:04:40.800 --> 1:04:44.080]  and it's time to wake up

[1:06:09.760 --> 1:06:14.240]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[1:06:14.240 --> 1:06:17.600]  company allows you to have it's true total government control
[1:06:17.600 --> 1:06:20.720]  of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[1:06:20.720 --> 1:06:24.400]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[1:06:24.400 --> 1:06:27.280]  overloaded especially with the high demand summer months ahead
[1:06:27.280 --> 1:06:30.800]  number four the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again
[1:06:30.800 --> 1:06:33.920]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[1:06:33.920 --> 1:06:37.040]  outages number five a solar power generator provides
[1:06:37.040 --> 1:06:40.880]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar
[1:06:40.880 --> 1:06:43.920]  power generators offered by solutions from science a long time

[1:07:04.320 --> 1:07:07.920]  if you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm
[1:07:07.920 --> 1:07:11.680]  how much ammunition do you want my answer would be all i can get
[1:07:11.680 --> 1:07:16.000]  in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones food is your only
[1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:19.040]  ammunition how much do you want when do you want it
[1:07:19.040 --> 1:07:22.000]  now or after the battle starts when will you need it
[1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:25.520]  can you buy it without proper identification will there be any food
[1:07:25.520 --> 1:07:29.040]  will it make your children sick if there's a quarantine and you can't feed
[1:07:29.040 --> 1:07:32.320]  yourself will you go to the gathering center and be immunized
[1:07:32.320 --> 1:07:35.920]  you wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply
[1:07:35.920 --> 1:07:39.680]  food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life
[1:07:39.680 --> 1:07:43.840]  how much will you need we don't know how much do you want all you can get
[1:07:43.840 --> 1:07:48.080]  i'm alex jones i want all of you good guys to live to fight another day

[1:08:02.160 --> 1:08:06.320]  from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines
[1:08:06.320 --> 1:08:21.680]  the information war continues it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[1:08:21.680 --> 1:08:24.880]  continuing our expose the scientific dictatorship
[1:08:24.880 --> 1:08:32.320]  massive news blitz coming up in t-minus 20 minutes right now let's go back to
[1:08:32.320 --> 1:08:38.800]  your calls let's go ahead and talk to jock in
[1:08:38.800 --> 1:08:43.040]  california go ahead hey alex how's it going
[1:08:43.040 --> 1:08:46.880]  good sir well you're so informed on so many things you
[1:08:46.880 --> 1:08:50.480]  probably know this but you're talking about the garter cell vaccine
[1:08:50.480 --> 1:08:54.400]  earlier and i don't know if you know that the fda allowed
[1:08:54.400 --> 1:08:58.560]  murk to put poisonous aluminum in the placebo
[1:08:58.560 --> 1:09:04.000]  in their clinical trials i remember having some medical doctors on three
[1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:08.320]  years ago when all the women were dying or having seizures or
[1:09:08.320 --> 1:09:13.440]  having autoimmune diseases erupt when they were taking it we tried to warn
[1:09:13.440 --> 1:09:16.400]  people but of course we don't reach that many people
[1:09:16.400 --> 1:09:20.080]  compared to all the tv ads they ran i knew that they got
[1:09:20.080 --> 1:09:23.920]  rick perry paid off to quote make it mandatory which was another fraud just to
[1:09:23.920 --> 1:09:27.840]  put it on the list of vaccines they tell the poor school kids are mandatory when
[1:09:27.840 --> 1:09:32.000]  they're not and so that vaccine protection fund would kick in
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:35.760]  because when the government mandates a vaccine then the
[1:09:35.760 --> 1:09:39.040]  vaccine damage slush fund so they knew it was a drug
[1:09:39.040 --> 1:09:43.200]  killing people and they don't care because they're eugenicist
[1:09:43.200 --> 1:09:47.360]  and uh but to go ahead and make your point about that
[1:09:47.360 --> 1:09:51.600]  well um i think that most of us learned in high school what that a placebo is
[1:09:51.600 --> 1:09:55.280]  supposed to be the harmless do nothing substance that uh
[1:09:55.280 --> 1:09:58.800]  that helps scientists figure out what some other substance that might be doing
[1:09:58.800 --> 1:10:02.320]  something um is doing and if you're going to put aluminum in the in the
[1:10:02.320 --> 1:10:06.320]  placebo uh then that's clearly uh that's clearly
[1:10:06.320 --> 1:10:10.160]  fraud scientifically sure and they also a lot of those studies
[1:10:10.160 --> 1:10:13.440]  allow them to put the squalene and other things in
[1:10:13.440 --> 1:10:16.640]  and and the more doctors i talk to it's not even the mercury in the vaccines
[1:10:16.640 --> 1:10:20.720]  it's bad and it's not good but that itself is a red herring
[1:10:20.720 --> 1:10:25.120]  but if i can convince people not to take shots because of mercury you know
[1:10:25.120 --> 1:10:28.320]  i mean more power to that information that it's really
[1:10:28.320 --> 1:10:32.960]  the squalene and things that cause the big autoimmune response
[1:10:32.960 --> 1:10:37.200]  that then cause the brain and organs to swell that's causing the brain damage
[1:10:37.200 --> 1:10:40.960]  and other uh medical problems and that's not alex jones that's the medical
[1:10:40.960 --> 1:10:44.080]  doctors after medical doctor and the studies
[1:10:44.080 --> 1:10:48.240]  us and then of course all the rna and the dna
[1:10:48.240 --> 1:10:52.640]  every time i mention there's viruses in the vaccines i get emails going viruses
[1:10:52.640 --> 1:10:57.440]  have rna not dna yes i know that there are other dna
[1:10:57.440 --> 1:11:04.880]  sequences from the fetuses from the monkeys from the different
[1:11:04.880 --> 1:11:11.840]  uh tissues both human and animal that are used to grow the viruses
[1:11:11.840 --> 1:11:16.080]  see other things are growing in this not just the particular virus they're
[1:11:16.080 --> 1:11:18.800]  looking for and so if you're growing this in pig
[1:11:18.800 --> 1:11:22.800]  tissue or rhesus monkey or green monkey tissue or fetal tissue
[1:11:22.800 --> 1:11:28.080]  there are other viruses and other uh micro plasms in there and there's all
[1:11:28.080 --> 1:11:31.680]  sorts of mutations and things happening and that's being injected into your
[1:11:31.680 --> 1:11:36.560]  body anything else sir well um yeah i guess you just
[1:11:36.560 --> 1:11:40.640]  mentioned so many different animal tissues that that vaccines
[1:11:40.640 --> 1:11:46.080]  are come from uh monkey tissues and an aborted human fetal cell
[1:11:46.080 --> 1:11:50.400]  tissue so i mean one if you're a vegetarian you might want to get it you
[1:11:50.400 --> 1:11:54.240]  might want to not get a vaccine and and two if you don't like having aborted
[1:11:54.240 --> 1:11:58.400]  fetal cell tissues from human beings uh injected into your body then
[1:11:58.400 --> 1:12:03.280]  that might be another consideration it's insane i appreciate your call great
[1:12:03.280 --> 1:12:08.240]  points we're gonna more calls in a moment but i do just want to add
[1:12:08.240 --> 1:12:12.320]  that this stuff is so strange
[1:12:12.320 --> 1:12:16.960]  that it even bothers my mind
[1:12:16.960 --> 1:12:20.880]  one way i break people's conditioning i found the last two years
[1:12:20.880 --> 1:12:24.320]  is if i'm at dinner with somebody who's laughing at me there's always now a
[1:12:24.320 --> 1:12:28.640]  laptop or computer nearby or an iphone i'll say
[1:12:28.640 --> 1:12:31.600]  okay you don't have a problem with genetic engineering
[1:12:31.600 --> 1:12:35.680]  and gmo food they're like yeah it's no big deal
[1:12:35.680 --> 1:12:38.960]  and they've been doing that for thousands of years no
[1:12:38.960 --> 1:12:42.480]  breeding a dog has been done for thousands of years but they take the basic
[1:12:42.480 --> 1:12:46.320]  genetic code that's there and then manipulate it
[1:12:46.320 --> 1:12:51.120]  through the practice of breeding but it's all still the same dna
[1:12:51.120 --> 1:12:55.280]  when you take cross species plant and animal and insect
[1:12:55.280 --> 1:12:58.960]  and mix them all together and then put them into dna sequences
[1:12:58.960 --> 1:13:02.320]  and then put viruses ended to dna sequences and
[1:13:02.320 --> 1:13:08.480]  rna into dna sequences and and mitre chondrial dna into dna sequences that
[1:13:08.480 --> 1:13:12.480]  are non-mitre chondrial i mean this is some dangerous stuff according to
[1:13:12.480 --> 1:13:16.000]  top genetic engineers we've interviewed giving rise to super viruses and other
[1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:21.200]  things and super carriers and cross species
[1:13:21.200 --> 1:13:25.680]  bridging from other zoological viruses and bacteria to humans
[1:13:25.680 --> 1:13:31.840]  i mean this is the way you make bio weapons the most deadly type
[1:13:31.840 --> 1:13:35.840]  because naturally occurring viruses and bacteria may kill small amounts of
[1:13:35.840 --> 1:13:40.000]  people but immunity is developed quickly and
[1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:43.760]  it doesn't normally attack large numbers it's always something alien and
[1:13:43.760 --> 1:13:47.280]  radically new that's so deadly
[1:13:47.360 --> 1:13:50.400]  and that's what they're doing and then they'll laugh at me on that and i'll
[1:13:50.400 --> 1:13:53.520]  say look let's just do something simple
[1:13:53.520 --> 1:13:57.760]  let's just do something simple here together turn your computer on
[1:13:57.760 --> 1:14:02.560]  or do you mind if i use that laptop over there and we fire up the laptop and i
[1:14:02.560 --> 1:14:08.080]  say google or search engine
[1:14:09.440 --> 1:14:12.720]  use whatever search engine you like
[1:14:13.920 --> 1:14:17.600]  manufacturing process
[1:14:18.560 --> 1:14:22.960]  aspartame or manufacturing process or how to manufacture aspartame
[1:14:22.960 --> 1:14:26.240]  and you'll be on university websites and they'll
[1:14:26.240 --> 1:14:29.920]  they have nice technical terms for it but
[1:14:29.920 --> 1:14:35.040]  they take a genetically engineered ecoli bacteria
[1:14:35.520 --> 1:14:40.000]  a bacteria that normally lives in sewage they genetically engineer it to
[1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:46.080]  eat different forms of toxic waste just like they have oil eating bacteria
[1:14:46.080 --> 1:14:49.440]  similar to that for oil spills and then it
[1:14:49.440 --> 1:14:52.960]  defecates aspartame
[1:14:54.400 --> 1:14:58.480]  or the base product of it then they ferment the dead bacteria and their
[1:14:58.480 --> 1:15:01.520]  feces and then that's your aspartame and they always
[1:15:01.520 --> 1:15:05.040]  laugh and i say bet me ten thousand dollars
[1:15:05.040 --> 1:15:08.800]  and then a lot of times they see that i'm confident
[1:15:08.800 --> 1:15:12.640]  because see with the ignorant yuppies everything is only about
[1:15:12.640 --> 1:15:15.920]  the illusion of confidence so if you're actually confident with the truth
[1:15:15.920 --> 1:15:20.080]  they may actually look and then they go in and see the information and they
[1:15:20.080 --> 1:15:22.960]  freak out because then they read that it was
[1:15:22.960 --> 1:15:28.000]  developed in 1966 as a bio weapon they were doing bio weapons
[1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:31.600]  research the army developed it and then farmed it out to
[1:15:31.600 --> 1:15:36.400]  searl and the guy that at that time in the 70s was the head of the defense
[1:15:36.400 --> 1:15:40.880]  department donald rumsfeld he came back in 2001 to be defense
[1:15:40.880 --> 1:15:44.880]  sec or sec death
[1:15:49.360 --> 1:15:53.520]  it's a chemical weapon derived from a bio weapon experiment okay now i'm at
[1:15:53.520 --> 1:15:56.640]  look he just gets weirder from there i could go on for
[1:15:56.640 --> 1:16:00.720]  hour after hour the insanity of what we're living under what we're in the

[1:25:24.800 --> 1:25:28.640]  in vietnam it screwed up a lot of the men
[1:25:29.760 --> 1:25:33.760]  and you know a lot of the macho people after world war two
[1:25:33.760 --> 1:25:36.880]  and korea and vietnam you know guys that would kill you over looking at them

[1:25:46.320 --> 1:25:50.320]  banks and killing their families i got a stack of news here because they made
[1:25:50.320 --> 1:25:55.520]  them serve three four five tours in hardcore guerrilla
[1:25:55.520 --> 1:25:59.920]  combat which is the worst type to make people go crazy
[1:25:59.920 --> 1:26:03.840]  we all know old vets folks
[1:26:03.840 --> 1:26:07.520]  that somebody says something wrong to him at a barbecue and they stab
[1:26:07.520 --> 1:26:11.120]  the neighbor in the throat and kill him i mean don't we all know those people
[1:26:11.120 --> 1:26:14.480]  well now they're all around us and they didn't serve one tour folks they
[1:26:14.480 --> 1:26:18.320]  serve three or four or five and they are out of their minds
[1:26:18.320 --> 1:26:22.000]  they are completely brain fried there's that rare individual
[1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:25.200]  because of their morals and family upbringing genetics whatever that
[1:26:25.200 --> 1:26:30.160]  doesn't melt down and turn into a nut but most people
[1:26:30.160 --> 1:26:34.800]  can't handle this stuff or they can't ever get out of it
[1:26:36.880 --> 1:26:39.680]  it's more than post-traumatic stress disorder you know that's what the
[1:26:39.680 --> 1:26:42.640]  psychologists call it
[1:26:45.280 --> 1:26:48.640]  and the globalist grow these people that's why they want wars they
[1:26:48.640 --> 1:26:51.680]  they need to create crops of these people to bring them back and make them be
[1:26:51.680 --> 1:26:55.680]  our rulers the enforcers let's go to your
[1:26:55.680 --> 1:26:57.920]  calls here i'll keep taking calls in the next segment
[1:26:57.920 --> 1:27:01.520]  let's talk to um
[1:27:01.520 --> 1:27:05.680]  brian and montreal hi how's it going good
[1:27:05.680 --> 1:27:09.200]  um i was just calling to let you know alex that on friday
[1:27:09.200 --> 1:27:14.400]  the canadian government health canada approved tamiflu for babies
[1:27:14.400 --> 1:27:17.280]  so they're completely ignoring all of the side effects
[1:27:17.280 --> 1:27:20.640]  and they're completely ignoring all of the cases that are being reported of
[1:27:20.640 --> 1:27:25.760]  uh strain resistance to tamiflu well they admit that it doesn't protect
[1:27:25.760 --> 1:27:29.280]  against the flu the japan five years ago banned it
[1:27:29.280 --> 1:27:32.720]  it made people commit suicide it made people die
[1:27:32.720 --> 1:27:36.800]  it makes people have delusions uh and uh
[1:27:36.800 --> 1:27:40.800]  you know they just don't care this is from the same organization that has
[1:27:40.800 --> 1:27:44.560]  changed the fluoride from a toxic contaminant to a health
[1:27:44.560 --> 1:27:46.800]  product so it's not a big surprise up here in the
[1:27:46.800 --> 1:27:50.800]  nazi north canada really is one of the biggest
[1:27:50.800 --> 1:27:54.240]  police states in the world and the people are some of the most asleep in
[1:27:54.240 --> 1:27:59.040]  the world very nice people canadians are smart nice people but they're
[1:27:59.040 --> 1:28:03.920]  they're under a spell and and maybe i would too up in
[1:28:03.920 --> 1:28:07.040]  almost beautiful pine trees and blue skies but uh
[1:28:07.040 --> 1:28:12.000]  it uh it really is sick i'd also like to let you know that um
[1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:16.080]  about a month ago it was brought to my attention at the 1918 sample that they
[1:28:16.080 --> 1:28:19.920]  took was from an inuit woman and right away because i've
[1:28:19.920 --> 1:28:23.760]  taken biology the mass in my head i thought to myself they're doing this
[1:28:23.760 --> 1:28:27.040]  because every other native north american indian
[1:28:27.040 --> 1:28:30.880]  descends from the inuits so i had this fear about a month ago
[1:28:30.880 --> 1:28:35.360]  that it would start hitting the indians more and now here we are a month later
[1:28:35.360 --> 1:28:39.520]  and they are reporting across canada that all the indian reservations
[1:28:39.520 --> 1:28:44.720]  are in a state of emergency and yeah well the feds also do that and then they
[1:28:44.720 --> 1:28:49.200]  sterilize them and inject them by locking it down but
[1:28:49.200 --> 1:28:52.640]  yes they it's in army manuals copied from the
[1:28:52.640 --> 1:28:56.240]  british manuals about how to give them the smallpox blankets
[1:28:56.240 --> 1:29:00.000]  how you know when your troops have freshly had the sores
[1:29:00.000 --> 1:29:04.320]  even squeeze a few you know wipe some of the sores off on the blankets
[1:29:04.320 --> 1:29:07.680]  and then immediately give them to the indians and then you'll be able to move
[1:29:07.680 --> 1:29:11.680]  into their property a month later montreal i came to find out from a man
[1:29:11.680 --> 1:29:15.120]  that i talked to this weekend he's a frenchman but he ends up working with

[1:33:22.880 --> 1:33:29.360]  people shuffling their feet got bill burr coming on talk about the murder
[1:33:29.360 --> 1:33:32.800]  controversy is a warning sign on the road
[1:33:32.800 --> 1:33:36.720]  i will explain next hour why i haven't spent a lot of time on it i've spent
[1:33:36.720 --> 1:33:40.720]  some but that why now i am going to start getting
[1:33:40.720 --> 1:33:44.000]  into it because a lot of times i don't have
[1:33:44.000 --> 1:33:48.720]  something figured out at first it takes me time to study it look at it
[1:33:48.720 --> 1:33:54.560]  and to observe the enemy observe their activities observe their psychology
[1:33:54.560 --> 1:33:58.080]  observe their behavior until i start to get a clear picture
[1:33:58.080 --> 1:34:02.160]  i will say now i believe he was born in kenyon
[1:34:02.160 --> 1:34:07.920]  i believe it's legitimate from their actions
[1:34:07.920 --> 1:34:15.440]  the biggest point is that they keep lying in the mainstream news saying
[1:34:15.440 --> 1:34:19.040]  they've released the birth certificate
[1:34:19.040 --> 1:34:23.360]  and saying it's ridiculous it's crazy we've released the birth certificate
[1:34:23.360 --> 1:34:27.920]  why are you know why are these nuts doing this
[1:34:27.920 --> 1:34:30.640]  and all that does is add fuel to the fire because everybody who's
[1:34:30.640 --> 1:34:33.760]  investigated knows they haven't released the birth certificate and other
[1:34:33.760 --> 1:34:37.840]  presidents have when asked
[1:34:38.160 --> 1:34:42.560]  that they've released a receipt of the birth certificate and it
[1:34:42.560 --> 1:34:45.760]  appears to be fake compared to other hawaiian
[1:34:45.760 --> 1:34:49.360]  certificates of birth certificate
[1:34:50.800 --> 1:34:56.880]  a receipt of birth certificate a receipt of birth
[1:34:56.880 --> 1:35:00.160]  and then you add about a hundred other points and it looks bad and now they're
[1:35:00.160 --> 1:35:03.600]  getting scared i watched a lot of television
[1:35:03.600 --> 1:35:07.760]  this weekend when i was running on the treadmill
[1:35:07.760 --> 1:35:12.000]  i'm trying to up it to running on the weekends about two hours a day
[1:35:12.000 --> 1:35:19.200]  hey it's worked i've lost 35 pounds now lose another 35 get skinny
[1:35:19.200 --> 1:35:22.480]  but uh side issue
[1:35:23.440 --> 1:35:27.120]  i watched television while i'm on the treadmill
[1:35:27.120 --> 1:35:31.520]  out there in the 105 degree garage that'll get the blubber to melt off of
[1:35:31.520 --> 1:35:35.760]  you but um
[1:35:35.760 --> 1:35:38.320]  doesn't matter i'm covering it next hour i'm going to cover all the details
[1:35:38.320 --> 1:35:41.040]  next hour instead of stopping and starting right now i want to
[1:35:41.040 --> 1:35:48.480]  jam in john sherry phil and john and a few others 1-800-259-9231
[1:35:48.480 --> 1:35:51.920]  1-800-259-9231 i do want to plug a couple
[1:35:51.920 --> 1:35:57.040]  things here before i go back to your calls uh i got a
[1:35:57.040 --> 1:36:00.880]  call from ted anderson this morning
[1:36:01.680 --> 1:36:08.160]  he's on vacation with his wife writing harleys in the black hills
[1:36:08.160 --> 1:36:14.560]  man do i envy that and he called me saying i'm up here on a mountain top
[1:36:14.560 --> 1:36:18.960]  only place i can get sell and i'm gonna let you do that offer you did last
[1:36:18.960 --> 1:36:23.040]  week again and i said excuse me
[1:36:23.120 --> 1:36:28.080]  and he said yeah we've got a little bit left and uh i don't care i just want
[1:36:28.080 --> 1:36:30.560]  to blast all the competition i want to be
[1:36:30.560 --> 1:36:33.520]  the best deal out there because you know in the past when we have these deals
[1:36:33.520 --> 1:36:36.800]  and i tell you this is the end this is the end of it
[1:36:36.800 --> 1:36:41.120]  it is the end and last week he sold out of the silver coins
[1:36:41.120 --> 1:36:46.000]  at the lower price when silver had been a dollar and a half lower
[1:36:46.000 --> 1:36:49.840]  and he's almost sold out of the british sovereigns and the francs
[1:36:49.840 --> 1:36:56.240]  these are coins that he bought at the 905 to 913 level a couple months ago in a
[1:36:56.240 --> 1:36:59.680]  big huge buy he made they are almost all gone
[1:36:59.680 --> 1:37:03.280]  he believes they'll sell out today even if they do he will just sell you other
[1:37:03.280 --> 1:37:06.080]  coins he bought for more at the same price so these are
[1:37:06.080 --> 1:37:13.120]  factored in to a market between 905 an ounce and 913 an ounce
[1:37:13.120 --> 1:37:20.640]  he bought different groups at different prices when gold is at 955 today
[1:37:20.640 --> 1:37:25.840]  so we're talking right at 50 bucks above that
[1:37:26.720 --> 1:37:33.200]  between 48 and 50 plus above that right now
[1:37:33.200 --> 1:37:36.800]  so this is a super deal and the brokers are there
[1:37:36.800 --> 1:37:39.760]  right now and i i challenge you to find a better deal
[1:37:39.760 --> 1:37:42.320]  this is where i've chosen to get gold coins in the past when i have the
[1:37:42.320 --> 1:37:46.400]  capital as emergency backup funds
[1:37:46.400 --> 1:37:52.480]  british sovereign gold coins at bullion prices for months ago
[1:37:52.480 --> 1:37:57.840]  when it's way up now and it even has numismatic collector value
[1:37:57.840 --> 1:38:01.040]  so it's a win win win win win for 266
[1:38:01.040 --> 1:38:07.200]  dollars her coin 266 british sovereign gold coins
[1:38:07.200 --> 1:38:12.640]  great deal frank's this is the best at 216
[1:38:12.640 --> 1:38:19.760]  frank's at 216 now i've never seen ted offer a deal this good this long
[1:38:19.760 --> 1:38:23.120]  these deals do end i'm surprised it's not over he said it was over last when he
[1:38:23.120 --> 1:38:28.320]  said no i've got a little bit left frank's at 216
[1:38:28.320 --> 1:38:33.840]  and he's out of the silver dollars at the price from two months ago
[1:38:33.840 --> 1:38:37.280]  when gold and silver took a dip but he's not out of walking liberty half
[1:38:37.280 --> 1:38:40.320]  dollars from world war two gorgeous coins i've
[1:38:40.320 --> 1:38:44.800]  owned a bag of these 869 a piece another great deal

[1:38:48.000 --> 1:38:52.640]  they have the Lakota silver round at 1974
[1:38:52.640 --> 1:39:01.680]  silver is way up above this now bottom line it's a very very good deal
[1:39:01.680 --> 1:39:05.280]  and they will show out of these walking liberty half dollars at that price very
[1:39:05.280 --> 1:39:08.560]  very quickly like they did the Lakotas those have gone up a bit but they have
[1:39:08.560 --> 1:39:11.200]  those still a great price the frank's at 216

[1:43:06.640 --> 1:43:10.160]  understand folks i'm not tuning my horn we need to point out that we know what
[1:43:10.160 --> 1:43:14.400]  we're talking about here this is valuable information to all of us in our
[1:43:14.400 --> 1:43:17.760]  future and my life depends on waking all you up and
[1:43:17.760 --> 1:43:23.040]  you waking others up i mean i passed the point i'll return a
[1:43:23.040 --> 1:43:26.000]  long time ago ladies and gentlemen fighting these people
[1:43:26.000 --> 1:43:30.240]  i got to stay in the public eye i got to get bigger i got to reach more people
[1:43:30.240 --> 1:43:34.320]  we've got to take the fight to the enemy there's no going back and there's no
[1:43:34.320 --> 1:43:39.280]  going back for you either history shows that but
[1:43:39.280 --> 1:43:45.360]  side point very heavy question the caller brings up
[1:43:45.360 --> 1:43:50.640]  on march 3rd and march 4th and march 5th and march 6th on a whole line of shows
[1:43:50.640 --> 1:43:55.440]  and people gone and pulled the clips out and put it up on youtube
[1:43:55.440 --> 1:44:00.400]  i laid out exactly what was going to happen because of the chatter
[1:44:00.400 --> 1:44:05.680]  we had fbi sources federal marshal sources city manager sources county
[1:44:05.680 --> 1:44:13.680]  emergency manager sources newspaper sources all of my sources
[1:44:13.680 --> 1:44:17.200]  said they're probably going to pull some flu scam and they're telling us get
[1:44:17.200 --> 1:44:20.720]  ready for marshal law and mass graves then i started getting a secret mass
[1:44:20.720 --> 1:44:24.080]  grave documents out of new york and out of indiana and out of
[1:44:24.080 --> 1:44:27.600]  illinois and i posted them and got laughed at even though it had the
[1:44:27.600 --> 1:44:32.560]  stinking phone numbers official letterhead and then later it all came out
[1:44:32.560 --> 1:44:37.440]  now associated press yesterday it's true it's real they're getting ready for
[1:44:37.440 --> 1:44:44.000]  mass graves and senators
[1:44:44.000 --> 1:44:48.000]  so and then i have these weird co until people email me and call me and go
[1:44:48.000 --> 1:44:53.440]  tell us who your fbi source is tell us who your pentagon source is tell us who
[1:44:53.440 --> 1:44:58.080]  your federal marshal sources are
[1:44:58.080 --> 1:45:01.360]  yeah so they can get in trouble that's a real good idea
[1:45:01.360 --> 1:45:05.760]  just like when we broke the clergy response teams how they were secretly
[1:45:05.760 --> 1:45:09.600]  hiring all these preachers under fema payroll to get ready for marshal law
[1:45:09.600 --> 1:45:14.240]  people are like you tell us who gave you the documents the stinking documents
[1:45:14.240 --> 1:45:19.600]  had the phone numbers and links and ended to fema
[1:45:19.600 --> 1:45:22.480]  and then the preacher one preacher that gave it to me said oh don't worry about
[1:45:22.480 --> 1:45:25.520]  it i went up to a little corner place not my office to fax it
[1:45:25.520 --> 1:45:30.400]  i went to a place you know another town on the edge of the county
[1:45:30.400 --> 1:45:34.800]  you don't have to black out the name of the stores fax machine
[1:45:34.800 --> 1:45:38.240]  at the top on all those documents so i posted it
[1:45:38.240 --> 1:45:44.720]  they sent the fbi and fema to the store got his credit card record of him
[1:45:44.720 --> 1:45:50.560]  paying the fax at that day and showed up at his office threatening
[1:45:50.560 --> 1:45:53.920]  you need to show us who the source is on that
[1:45:53.920 --> 1:45:59.040]  you're lying they're not secretly hiring preachers
[1:45:59.040 --> 1:46:02.800]  later year and a half later came out mainstream news word for word what i told
[1:46:02.800 --> 1:46:06.000]  you training for marshal law how to go to the camps
[1:46:06.000 --> 1:46:10.480]  how to take force inoculations but it wasn't word for word but i told you
[1:46:10.480 --> 1:46:15.600]  it's word for word what the documents said
[1:46:16.880 --> 1:46:21.360]  and over and over and over again so we've known for years they've been
[1:46:21.360 --> 1:46:24.400]  getting ready for marshal law under the guise of smallpox
[1:46:24.400 --> 1:46:28.640]  or flu we know they passed the model model states
[1:46:28.640 --> 1:46:32.880]  told emergency powers act to do it and then we start getting all this chatter
[1:46:32.880 --> 1:46:42.000]  in january and february into march to the point of for the third time ever
[1:46:42.000 --> 1:46:45.520]  i went on air just like i did before 9 11 in one other case
[1:46:45.520 --> 1:46:48.800]  and i said they're probably going to launch some type of flu
[1:46:48.800 --> 1:46:53.920]  pandemic or at least hype one up as the cover for marshal law and i said that in
[1:46:53.920 --> 1:46:57.680]  march over and over and over and we wrote articles about it
[1:46:57.680 --> 1:47:01.600]  erin dykes wrote articles about it
[1:47:03.440 --> 1:47:07.040]  and we got laughed at again then all of a sudden they start saying end of
[1:47:07.040 --> 1:47:11.440]  america lockdown it could kill millions could kill billions worldwide and i
[1:47:11.440 --> 1:47:14.720]  said folks i don't know if this is a hoax or not but this could be the big one
[1:47:14.720 --> 1:47:18.000]  because these people are eugenicist murderers and they've been gearing up
[1:47:18.000 --> 1:47:21.760]  for local government takeovers so this could either be a hoax
[1:47:21.760 --> 1:47:25.680]  to get you to take the shots as a smoke screen for federalization
[1:47:25.680 --> 1:47:30.160]  or this could be a real pandemic then days into that in april
[1:47:30.160 --> 1:47:34.400]  i get a secret state of texas document with phone numbers and names i call
[1:47:34.400 --> 1:47:37.760]  they ask where do you get this information i confirm it's real i go on
[1:47:37.760 --> 1:47:41.200]  air and say we're at level five now the media said we were at levels
[1:47:41.200 --> 1:47:45.120]  four and we're going to level six and ninety six hours and then it happened
[1:47:45.120 --> 1:47:49.520]  and you learn months later that that's what had happened exactly as i told you
[1:47:49.520 --> 1:47:54.560]  i got real sources ladies and gentlemen and if that isn't been proven yet you
[1:47:54.560 --> 1:47:56.800]  notice the co until pro comes out at me
[1:47:56.800 --> 1:48:00.240]  every time i break something because they don't want to kill me
[1:48:00.240 --> 1:48:02.800]  because that'll only make my information that much more powerful
[1:48:02.800 --> 1:48:08.880]  they want to discredit me folks when they try to discredit me they try to
[1:48:08.880 --> 1:48:13.600]  discredit you do you understand that they are we are taking heavy fire from
[1:48:13.600 --> 1:48:18.880]  government disinformation operatives and it's only going to get worse
[1:48:18.880 --> 1:48:23.360]  with all sorts of dirty tricks and stuff but i
[1:48:23.360 --> 1:48:28.400]  am a big boy and i asked for it and i'm ready to take it
[1:48:28.400 --> 1:48:34.720]  all i ask you to do is to defend me and continue to spread the word
[1:48:34.720 --> 1:48:39.600]  and not even so much defend me you know you defend me you defend yourself
[1:48:39.600 --> 1:48:46.080]  you don't defend me you tell people not to take the vaccines you expose why
[1:48:46.080 --> 1:48:49.120]  you tell the troops in military and police not to go along with the new
[1:48:49.120 --> 1:48:53.600]  world order stage terror you stay on issue and you expose and
[1:48:53.600 --> 1:48:58.000]  discredit the criminal system and then we can make their system stall
[1:48:58.000 --> 1:49:02.240]  then we can audit the fed and we don't win this time we'll win the second or
[1:49:02.240 --> 1:49:04.800]  third or fourth try you can see the momentum shifting
[1:49:04.800 --> 1:49:09.520]  and we can discredit these criminals and start arresting them like made off
[1:49:09.520 --> 1:49:12.640]  and other criminals just like richard nixon or any of them they are not
[1:49:12.640 --> 1:49:16.800]  invincible so you have to have faith we can win
[1:49:16.800 --> 1:49:21.760]  you have to stay on point and get the information out
[1:49:22.880 --> 1:49:26.320]  so you defend me by defending the republic and the truth
[1:49:26.320 --> 1:49:30.560]  so many people call and want to defend me it's rabbit trails it's rat holes it's
[1:49:30.560 --> 1:49:35.200]  lies the proof is in our work the proof is in
[1:49:35.200 --> 1:49:38.960]  what we've covered the proof is in our history and our facts
[1:49:38.960 --> 1:49:43.520]  and no amount of straw men or misrepresentations of who we are
[1:49:43.520 --> 1:49:47.360]  or what we are or our record are going to work
[1:49:47.360 --> 1:49:51.360]  just like all the barack obama's propaganda and lies aren't going to fix
[1:49:51.360 --> 1:49:59.200]  what he's doing the truth in the end wins evil in the end always fails
[1:49:59.200 --> 1:50:02.880]  no matter how scientifically arranged it is no matter how slickly
[1:50:02.880 --> 1:50:07.280]  the design has been woven if you just say no and start spreading the word
[1:50:07.280 --> 1:50:10.720]  speaking out handing out copies of the obama deception
[1:50:10.720 --> 1:50:14.080]  and and and getting the word out and bumper stickers and calling in to talk
[1:50:14.080 --> 1:50:16.960]  radio shows and starting websites and getting access
[1:50:16.960 --> 1:50:20.960]  tv shows and buying radio time for your own show if you have to
[1:50:20.960 --> 1:50:24.640]  i don't care if you're not the most articulate it doesn't matter what wins
[1:50:24.640 --> 1:50:28.400]  wars is taking action and getting in the fight
[1:50:28.400 --> 1:50:32.320]  like general stubblebind said mass and we've got the mass
[1:50:32.320 --> 1:50:36.080]  we've just got to activate the mass activate your area
[1:50:36.080 --> 1:50:43.360]  as an info warrior as a 1776 patriot reborn as a special forces operator for
[1:50:43.360 --> 1:50:46.240]  liberty and truth wielding the weapon of truth and start
[1:50:46.240 --> 1:50:49.280]  blasting in all directions discrediting this enemy
[1:50:49.280 --> 1:50:52.640]  operation and exposing all their tricks and stage terror
[1:50:52.640 --> 1:50:56.400]  and stage crises and keep moving forward to positive fashion
[1:50:56.400 --> 1:51:01.280]  never surrendering we're gonna win more calls coming up
[1:51:01.280 --> 1:51:04.480]  in the new world order's war against humanity
[1:51:04.480 --> 1:51:08.960]  barack obama is the tip of the spear we've got to have a civilian national
[1:51:08.960 --> 1:51:13.200]  security force that's just as powerful just as strong
[1:51:13.200 --> 1:51:17.920]  just as well funded the obama deception completely destroys the myth
[1:51:17.920 --> 1:51:21.200]  that obama is working for the best interest of the american people
[1:51:21.200 --> 1:51:25.840]  while obama's already fudging yeah fudge since day one in this election if
[1:51:25.840 --> 1:51:30.000]  you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[1:51:30.000 --> 1:51:33.680]  who is imposing the program of a group of extreme
[1:51:33.680 --> 1:51:37.280]  bankers and finance oligarchs that's fascism
[1:51:37.280 --> 1:51:40.880]  it's not about left or right it's about a one-world government
[1:51:40.880 --> 1:51:45.840]  this film documents who obama works for the lies he is told

[1:52:42.000 --> 1:52:45.360]  that to me doesn't make sense in using something that is natural
[1:52:45.360 --> 1:52:48.800]  that is absorbed into the body particularly because in a liquid form

[1:55:37.160 --> 1:55:39.160]  God bless you, sir, what's on your mind?
[1:55:39.160 --> 1:55:44.160]  On the YouTube, they started an NLE 09 overwatch
[1:55:44.160 --> 1:55:48.160]  Is it to report pictures or any troop movements with videos or pictures?
[1:55:48.160 --> 1:55:51.160]  Yes, I saw that last night, and I meant to give it to my guys
[1:55:51.160 --> 1:55:53.160]  And that's just like the thousands of pieces of data
[1:55:53.160 --> 1:55:56.160]  I see every few days, and I forget most of them
[1:55:56.160 --> 1:55:59.160]  Because you can look at stuff fast, but then to track it down
[1:55:59.160 --> 1:56:01.160]  What's the YouTube channel?
[1:56:01.160 --> 1:56:03.160]  Because I saw some good info on that
[1:56:03.160 --> 1:56:10.160]  And we will get a full-time sector post on Info Wars or Prison Planet

[1:56:17.160 --> 1:56:20.160]  Well, there's a lot of different channels
[1:56:20.160 --> 1:56:23.160]  I saw a different one that's doing that, but yeah, a lot of key stuff
[1:56:23.160 --> 1:56:25.160]  In fact, guys, tell us
[1:56:25.160 --> 1:56:29.160]  All you do is type in NLE 09
[1:56:29.160 --> 1:56:31.160]  And then do a search, and then do the newest search
[1:56:31.160 --> 1:56:33.160]  And then it'll all come up
[1:56:33.160 --> 1:56:36.160]  Absolutely, and I've asked my web guys to be posting a lot of that
[1:56:36.160 --> 1:56:40.160]  I want to create a whole section in the next week just on NLE 09
[1:56:40.160 --> 1:56:43.160]  I want to create a battle watch section on the flu
[1:56:43.160 --> 1:56:47.160]  We've got to start not just posting main articles, but have special sections
[1:56:47.160 --> 1:56:50.160]  That only go for a month or so during key events
[1:56:50.160 --> 1:56:52.160]  Great idea! Anything else, John?
[1:56:52.160 --> 1:56:54.160]  No, that'll be it. Thank you
[1:56:54.160 --> 1:56:56.160]  God bless you, sir. Appreciate the call
[1:56:58.160 --> 1:57:01.160]  Sherri and Teha, shirin' on the air, Sherri
[1:57:01.160 --> 1:57:07.160]  Hey, Alex. I compiled a bunch of articles, like you just said
[1:57:07.160 --> 1:57:12.160]  We shouldn't do, but I compiled a bunch of articles on squaling
[1:57:12.160 --> 1:57:18.160]  And other oil-based adjuvants that are going to be put in vaccines this fall
[1:57:18.160 --> 1:57:23.160]  Specifically, GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis' vaccines
[1:57:23.160 --> 1:57:30.160]  And I used to think that mercury was the biggest problem there was with these vaccines
[1:57:30.160 --> 1:57:37.160]  It turns out that it's not. It's the antigen-sparing oil-based adjuvants that are the worst
[1:57:37.160 --> 1:57:42.160]  Aluminum's bad enough, but this one is really bad
[1:57:42.160 --> 1:57:47.160]  Yeah, no, it's a witch's brew, and they argue, well, you can eat small amounts of squaling
[1:57:47.160 --> 1:57:49.160]  Yes, but it's not in your blood supply
[1:57:49.160 --> 1:57:53.160]  It turns on the autoimmune response
[1:57:53.160 --> 1:57:59.160]  And then whenever you get that autoimmune response, it's like a cytokine-type reaction
[1:57:59.160 --> 1:58:06.160]  What happens is your body starts attacking all of the places in your body
[1:58:06.160 --> 1:58:09.160]  Where it thinks that that oil is found
[1:58:09.160 --> 1:58:10.160]  Yes
[1:58:10.160 --> 1:58:13.160]  It causes an autoimmune response
[1:58:13.160 --> 1:58:17.160]  For a layman, it's like getting poison ivy all over your organs
[1:58:17.160 --> 1:58:22.160]  Yeah, like 10 million people already right now have autoimmune disorders in the United States
[1:58:22.160 --> 1:58:32.160]  Hey, this is the thing killing the women that take the large percentages of the women that take it are done
[1:58:32.160 --> 1:58:35.160]  The rest of their life, they're fried, they're in a wheelchair
[1:58:35.160 --> 1:58:53.160]  And Merg just says, hell yeah, baby, stay there, ma'am
[1:59:05.160 --> 1:59:11.160]  Inerthealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years

[2:00:17.160 --> 2:00:23.160]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones
[2:00:23.160 --> 2:00:28.160]  Okay, we are simulcasting the second half of the syndicated radio show
[2:00:28.160 --> 2:00:36.160]  I'm here live from Monday through Friday from 11am to 3pm, central standard time, it's 12 noon to 4pm, weekdays
[2:00:36.160 --> 2:00:40.160]  And we simulcast at least the last two hours, some days we do the whole show
[2:00:40.160 --> 2:00:48.160]  Simulcasting in living color, the radio show turns into a slash TV show at prisonplanet.tv
[2:00:48.160 --> 2:00:53.160]  We want to thank all the prisonplanet.tv supporters out there that are members
[2:00:53.160 --> 2:00:57.160]  And all the listeners listening, of course, on the radio as well
[2:00:57.160 --> 2:01:01.160]  We're going to take a few calls, finish up with Sherry and others
[2:01:01.160 --> 2:01:07.160]  Phil Berg is coming up, I haven't in months covered the birther issue, his birth certificate
[2:01:07.160 --> 2:01:11.160]  Because I wanted to sit back and really study it first
[2:01:11.160 --> 2:01:14.160]  And I've been studying it now for a year
[2:01:14.160 --> 2:01:17.160]  And I can say that where there's smoke, there's fire
[2:01:17.160 --> 2:01:20.160]  They're covering up, they're hiding something
[2:01:20.160 --> 2:01:26.160]  And I can say that, pretty much certainty now, it looks like he probably was born in Kenya
[2:01:26.160 --> 2:01:29.160]  And this is becoming a major issue
[2:01:29.160 --> 2:01:31.160]  And so now we're going to tackle it
[2:01:31.160 --> 2:01:33.160]  And the new Obama film also gets into it some
[2:01:33.160 --> 2:01:36.160]  I wanted to make a film based on all the other bad stuff he's doing
[2:01:36.160 --> 2:01:39.160]  Because they always say, no one will attack his real policies
[2:01:39.160 --> 2:01:41.160]  And that's totally made up
[2:01:41.160 --> 2:01:44.160]  We do go over the policies and the deceit and the corruption
[2:01:44.160 --> 2:01:47.160]  But Phil Berg's coming up
[2:01:47.160 --> 2:01:53.160]  Sherry in Texas was talking about the squalene and other chemicals they put in vaccines
[2:01:53.160 --> 2:01:57.160]  Not just the mercury or aluminum that caused the autoimmune disease
[2:01:57.160 --> 2:02:01.160]  And that caused the body to attack itself
[2:02:01.160 --> 2:02:06.160]  And how suddenly out of the blue, tens of millions of Americans are getting these autoimmune diseases
[2:02:06.160 --> 2:02:14.160]  And I remember during the approval, during the trials of Gardasil, the human papillomavirus, live cancer virus vaccine
[2:02:14.160 --> 2:02:19.160]  Why were they pushing this national vaccine for something that kills 3,000 people a year?
[2:02:19.160 --> 2:02:22.160]  That's not that many for cancer, way down the list
[2:02:22.160 --> 2:02:24.160]  Very easily treatable
[2:02:24.160 --> 2:02:29.160]  The vaccine itself didn't protect, they admitted against most strains of the virus
[2:02:29.160 --> 2:02:34.160]  So it made no sense to realize that Merck's cold-blooded eugenicist
[2:02:34.160 --> 2:02:36.160]  With all the other stuff they do
[2:02:36.160 --> 2:02:40.160]  And then these women were taking it and they were bleeding out of all their orifices
[2:02:40.160 --> 2:02:45.160]  And getting these red rashes and having an autoimmune disease with the body just attacks itself
[2:02:45.160 --> 2:02:50.160]  And then after your body kind of burns out, then you don't have any immune system left
[2:02:50.160 --> 2:02:54.160]  It goes crazy, then you, and they're in wheelchairs and they're dying
[2:02:54.160 --> 2:02:58.160]  And I keep talking about this, you know, Google for folks right now on screen, guys
[2:02:58.160 --> 2:03:03.160]  Gardasil deaths or Gardasil autoimmune, I mean, they know it does this
[2:03:03.160 --> 2:03:07.160]  But the drug company got government immunity
[2:03:07.160 --> 2:03:11.160]  And so this lady, Sherry, was bringing up for people that just joined us
[2:03:11.160 --> 2:03:17.160]  She's been doing her own research off we talked about with what these immune activators
[2:03:17.160 --> 2:03:21.160]  Like Squalene and others do, tell folks more about it in closing
[2:03:21.160 --> 2:03:29.160]  Well, basically, they're antigen sparing, which means that they claim that this is wonderful
[2:03:29.160 --> 2:03:36.160]  Because we get to reduce the amount of vaccine that we need for the dose
[2:03:36.160 --> 2:03:41.160]  But what they really mean by antigen sparing is they're putting an adjuvant in there
[2:03:41.160 --> 2:03:47.160]  And it turns your immune system way up so it recognizes the tiny amount of cancer virus they put in you
[2:03:47.160 --> 2:03:57.160]  Exactly, they, you know, say a more, you know, robust response and words like that
[2:03:57.160 --> 2:04:05.160]  And that's kind of creepy, but they like to make things that are horrible sound good
[2:04:05.160 --> 2:04:14.160]  They say like their strategic goal is to expand the supply of pre-pandemic and pandemic influenza vaccines
[2:04:14.160 --> 2:04:22.160]  But their specific aim is to, you know, determine whether the antigens can be used safely and effectively with adjuvants
[2:04:22.160 --> 2:04:27.160]  You know, they specifically mentioned the adjuvants and they've never been approved in the United States
[2:04:27.160 --> 2:04:30.160]  The adjuvant, Squalene has never been approved
[2:04:30.160 --> 2:04:35.160]  So, you know, that's pretty scary, it's never been approved
[2:04:35.160 --> 2:04:42.160]  But they've been given FDA waivers under the pandemic emergency to put it in there
[2:04:42.160 --> 2:04:46.160]  Yeah, that's like giving someone immunity for murder, premeditatively
[2:04:46.160 --> 2:04:50.160]  These are you, Genesis, great point, Sherry, glad you checked out the info for yourself
[2:04:50.160 --> 2:04:53.160]  And found out it was far worse than I was even saying
[2:04:53.160 --> 2:04:57.160]  It always is, folks, I don't have words to describe it
[2:04:57.160 --> 2:05:00.160]  One has to see the matrix, one can't be told about it
[2:05:28.160 --> 2:05:34.160]  The Acola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere

[2:07:01.160 --> 2:07:06.160]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer
[2:07:06.160 --> 2:07:10.160]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[2:07:10.160 --> 2:07:16.160]  Number two, our new energies are, wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[2:07:16.160 --> 2:07:21.160]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[2:07:21.160 --> 2:07:25.160]  Number three, in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[2:07:25.160 --> 2:07:27.160]  Especially with the high demand summer months ahead
[2:07:27.160 --> 2:07:31.160]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again
[2:07:31.160 --> 2:07:35.160]  Every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages
[2:07:35.160 --> 2:07:39.160]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[2:07:39.160 --> 2:07:45.160]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a long time sponsor of ours
[2:07:45.160 --> 2:07:50.160]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[2:07:50.160 --> 2:07:52.160]  That's mysolarbackup.com
[2:07:52.160 --> 2:07:56.160]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet, so go to mysolarbackup.com
[2:07:56.160 --> 2:08:15.160]  Or call toll-free 877-327-0365
[2:08:15.160 --> 2:08:29.160]  Bill J. Berg Esquire, the first attorney who filed suit against Barack H. Obama challenging Senator Obama's lack of constitutional qualifications and eligibility to serve as President of the United States and his cases that are still pending in federal court
[2:08:29.160 --> 2:08:45.160]  Berg versus Obama, third circuit court of appeals, number 08-4340, Berg as Realtor versus Obama, U.S. District Court, the District of Columbia, number 08-CV.01933
[2:08:45.160 --> 2:08:50.160]  ObamaCrimes.com is his site
[2:08:50.160 --> 2:08:53.160]  You know, I really respect Phil Berg
[2:08:53.160 --> 2:08:58.160]  And I was aware of a lot of his work on the Bill of Rights of Constitution previously
[2:08:58.160 --> 2:09:01.160]  He was also, what, a Deputy Attorney General of the major state
[2:09:01.160 --> 2:09:04.160]  He's just done a lot of important work
[2:09:04.160 --> 2:09:09.160]  And so I first saw him early in the campaign
[2:09:09.160 --> 2:09:12.160]  Start looking at Obama and the birth certificate
[2:09:12.160 --> 2:09:15.160]  And we've had him on many times and we've covered it
[2:09:15.160 --> 2:09:20.160]  I didn't put it in the Obama deception, the big premiere film about Obama
[2:09:20.160 --> 2:09:24.160]  Because I knew so many others were covering the birth certificate
[2:09:24.160 --> 2:09:28.160]  And that so many Democrats had closed their minds to the birth certificate
[2:09:28.160 --> 2:09:31.160]  It was seen as partisan even though Mr. Berg is a registered Democrat
[2:09:31.160 --> 2:09:36.160]  And involved, you know, with the ACLU and everything else, a lifelong Democrat
[2:09:36.160 --> 2:09:39.160]  That it wasn't partisan, it was the constitutional crisis issue
[2:09:39.160 --> 2:09:46.160]  And now he could be blackmailed with this info, which is clearly going on now
[2:09:46.160 --> 2:09:50.160]  So in the Obama deception, we cover his carbon tax, his anti-gun stances
[2:09:50.160 --> 2:09:55.160]  He wanted to start all these new wars, lying and hiring nothing but lobbyists
[2:09:55.160 --> 2:10:02.160]  His handlers, the Federal Reserve, people like Geithner
[2:10:02.160 --> 2:10:05.160]  Who were telling Bush what to do with the bailout
[2:10:05.160 --> 2:10:10.160]  Literally his bosses on the financial takeover, being Obama's handlers
[2:10:10.160 --> 2:10:13.160]  That's why the Obama deception didn't get into it
[2:10:13.160 --> 2:10:15.160]  It gets into everything that wasn't being covered
[2:10:15.160 --> 2:10:17.160]  Everything that wasn't being looked at
[2:10:17.160 --> 2:10:21.160]  While at the same time we've been covering the birther issue, as it's called
[2:10:21.160 --> 2:10:24.160]  Here on air
[2:10:24.160 --> 2:10:28.160]  Now, why do I have Phil Berg here? Why is he going to be on a lot more?
[2:10:28.160 --> 2:10:33.160]  Why are we going to get Colonel Hollister, who's one of his clients
[2:10:33.160 --> 2:10:37.160]  One of the high level military officers coming out and saying, I want to see the birth certificate
[2:10:37.160 --> 2:10:41.160]  Because it's now reached mega crest level
[2:10:41.160 --> 2:10:45.160]  Obama lies and says, I'm not going to hire any lobbyist, all he hires is lobbyist
[2:10:45.160 --> 2:10:48.160]  He says he's fighting banker bailout money to Goldman Sachs
[2:10:48.160 --> 2:10:54.160]  It turns out in AIG that he wrote a special piece to the bill to do it
[2:10:54.160 --> 2:10:57.160]  People know Obama's a liar now
[2:10:57.160 --> 2:11:03.160]  His approval rating's gone from 84 in the highest for Rasmussen to 49 in six months
[2:11:03.160 --> 2:11:07.160]  I mean, he is dropping like a rock right now
[2:11:07.160 --> 2:11:09.160]  In a big way
[2:11:09.160 --> 2:11:18.160]  And people know that when the media just says there's no truth
[2:11:18.160 --> 2:11:22.160]  Your kooks, how dare you ask to look at the birth certificate
[2:11:22.160 --> 2:11:27.160]  Everybody's seen the birth certificate when they've put out a receipt of birth certificate
[2:11:27.160 --> 2:11:34.160]  Itself, according to many mainline experts and people matching them with their receipts for birth certificate is a forgery
[2:11:34.160 --> 2:11:42.160]  So people see all this and they're really starting to ask very serious questions
[2:11:42.160 --> 2:11:50.160]  Then the Washington Post comes out and makes fun
[2:11:50.160 --> 2:11:55.160]  And then we're going to Phil Berg of anybody and everybody that asks questions
[2:11:55.160 --> 2:12:02.160]  The Berther Bruhaha, Washington Post
[2:12:02.160 --> 2:12:08.160]  And it says speculation about the true citizenship of President Barack Obama has resurfaced in recent days
[2:12:08.160 --> 2:12:11.160]  In part thanks to a viral video
[2:12:11.160 --> 2:12:15.160]  Despite a widely circulated copy of his certificate of live birth
[2:12:15.160 --> 2:12:21.160]  Notices in two Honolulu newspapers and other evidence some won't let the issue die
[2:12:21.160 --> 2:12:26.160]  Fanning the flames are commenters and commentators, Lou Dobbs and Rush Limbaugh
[2:12:26.160 --> 2:12:30.160]  Who have suggested the question remains unsolved
[2:12:30.160 --> 2:12:39.160]  And then House Republicans who have cosponsored bills that will require presidential candidates to provide a copy of their original birth certificate
[2:12:39.160 --> 2:12:42.160]  And then they ask this stupid poll question
[2:12:42.160 --> 2:12:45.160]  What for you would clear up the question of Obama's citizenship
[2:12:45.160 --> 2:12:50.160]  An official certificate and birth notices from two newspapers
[2:12:50.160 --> 2:12:55.160]  A time machine visit to the hospital on the day of the alleged birth
[2:12:55.160 --> 2:12:58.160]  Tie him up, throw him in the water if he floats
[2:12:58.160 --> 2:13:00.160]  And it's a witch hunt
[2:13:00.160 --> 2:13:01.160]  Nothing ever
[2:13:01.160 --> 2:13:05.160]  So see this poll is meant to ridicule anybody asking questions
[2:13:05.160 --> 2:13:09.160]  Even the semi serious first question first option
[2:13:09.160 --> 2:13:13.160]  An official certificate and birth notices from two newspapers
[2:13:13.160 --> 2:13:16.160]  See an official birth certificate would have done it
[2:13:16.160 --> 2:13:18.160]  But they won't do it, why?
[2:13:18.160 --> 2:13:22.160]  Why is he signed an executive order blocking the release of that document?
[2:13:22.160 --> 2:13:23.160]  Oh yes
[2:13:23.160 --> 2:13:28.160]  So see now we have his grandmother reportedly saying he was born there
[2:13:28.160 --> 2:13:32.160]  Now we have the government saying they put a plaque up at his birthplace
[2:13:32.160 --> 2:13:39.160]  I mean all of this evidence and now we have the expert, the guy who was there day one on all of this
[2:13:39.160 --> 2:13:42.160]  And my whole issue is I didn't know one way or the other
[2:13:42.160 --> 2:13:45.160]  But the way they act suspicious, the way they act scared
[2:13:45.160 --> 2:13:47.160]  Then I saw Bill Maher this weekend
[2:13:47.160 --> 2:13:52.160]  I watched politically, you know, his little propaganda real time with Bill Maher
[2:13:52.160 --> 2:13:57.160]  And he acted scared
[2:13:57.160 --> 2:14:00.160]  Mrs. Eisenhower on the show acted scared, they're freaked out
[2:14:00.160 --> 2:14:02.160]  And now I know why
[2:14:02.160 --> 2:14:06.160]  Everywhere congressmen go they're shouted down by this issue under the surface
[2:14:06.160 --> 2:14:10.160]  Because when the mainstream media just pats somebody on the head and says
[2:14:10.160 --> 2:14:12.160]  You've seen the birth certificate when we haven't
[2:14:12.160 --> 2:14:17.160]  And when there's all these cover-ups going on and his mother not being
[2:14:17.160 --> 2:14:20.160]  Living in the United States long enough when she had him
[2:14:20.160 --> 2:14:23.160]  Because you've got to have one parent who's lived here a certain amount of time
[2:14:23.160 --> 2:14:25.160]  For him to be present, he's not eligible that way either
[2:14:25.160 --> 2:14:27.160]  Any way you cut it, this is crazy
[2:14:27.160 --> 2:14:31.160]  We now go to Phil Berg and I appreciate him joining us
[2:14:31.160 --> 2:14:34.160]  I just wanted to recap the basics, obamacrimes.com
[2:14:34.160 --> 2:14:37.160]  Bottom line, Mr. Berg, what's really going on here?
[2:14:37.160 --> 2:14:39.160]  Well, it's a massive cover-up
[2:14:39.160 --> 2:14:44.160]  I believe it's the biggest host ever put forth to the citizens of this country
[2:14:44.160 --> 2:14:47.160]  In over 230 years in the history of our country
[2:14:47.160 --> 2:14:50.160]  And one person's responsible for it
[2:14:50.160 --> 2:14:52.160]  And that's actually his real name, we believe
[2:14:52.160 --> 2:14:54.160]  It's not Barack Hussein, Obama
[2:14:54.160 --> 2:14:57.160]  We believe his legal name today is Barry Soutoro
[2:14:57.160 --> 2:15:00.160]  When he was adopted in Indonesia
[2:15:00.160 --> 2:15:03.160]  And when all was said and done and the truth will come out
[2:15:03.160 --> 2:15:06.160]  I think Obama or Soutoro, whatever you want to call him
[2:15:06.160 --> 2:15:11.160]  His wife Michelle Obama, Howard Dean, the former head of the Democratic National Committee
[2:15:11.160 --> 2:15:13.160]  Other officials of the Democratic National Committee
[2:15:13.160 --> 2:15:18.160]  Senior campaign officials and now senior administration officials who know the truth about this
[2:15:18.160 --> 2:15:21.160]  Should all be subjected to the criminal justice system
[2:15:21.160 --> 2:15:24.160]  And tried and those that are convicted should go to jail
[2:15:24.160 --> 2:15:27.160]  And Obama should go to jail and then be deported
[2:15:27.160 --> 2:15:30.160]  This is outrageous what is going on here
[2:15:30.160 --> 2:15:33.160]  When Arnold Schwarzenegger, people have talked to him, the governor of California
[2:15:33.160 --> 2:15:35.160]  About running for president, what has he said?
[2:15:35.160 --> 2:15:37.160]  I'm in the Constitution
[2:15:37.160 --> 2:15:40.160]  And Barack Obama basically, without saying it is
[2:15:40.160 --> 2:15:42.160]  He's saying I'm walking all over the Constitution
[2:15:42.160 --> 2:15:44.160]  I don't care about the Constitution
[2:15:44.160 --> 2:15:49.160]  Why would all of his records, every record of Obama is sealed
[2:15:49.160 --> 2:15:54.160]  Every record, and I'm the first one to give a response on why his college records are being sealed
[2:15:54.160 --> 2:15:59.160]  I believe his records from Occidental, Columbia University, and Harvard Law School are sealed
[2:15:59.160 --> 2:16:03.160]  Because I believe they will show that he applied for and received foreign aid
[2:16:03.160 --> 2:16:07.160]  This is outrageous, the national media should be the
[2:16:07.160 --> 2:16:09.160]  I don't know if you saw it on Saturdays in the New York Times
[2:16:09.160 --> 2:16:12.160]  They actually quoted one of my quotes, the interview it made
[2:16:12.160 --> 2:16:14.160]  Because of the upswing with the media
[2:16:14.160 --> 2:16:17.160]  And I said I wish the national media, including the New York Times
[2:16:17.160 --> 2:16:20.160]  I wish I could sue them for not properly vetting Obama
[2:16:20.160 --> 2:16:24.160]  This is a total disgrace, for two years they didn't do anything
[2:16:24.160 --> 2:16:27.160]  But look what they did to Sarah Payle, and not that I'm saying I'm for her
[2:16:27.160 --> 2:16:30.160]  But they ripped her apart, what did they do to Obama?
[2:16:30.160 --> 2:16:33.160]  Anything he says is no big deal
[2:16:33.160 --> 2:16:36.160]  I loved the one when it was getting near the November elections
[2:16:36.160 --> 2:16:39.160]  And he stated, I'm now in my, I arrived in Oregon
[2:16:39.160 --> 2:16:44.160]  This is my 57th state, and they wouldn't let me go to Alaska or Hawaii
[2:16:44.160 --> 2:16:49.160]  I didn't know we had 59 states in this country, in this great country of ours
[2:16:49.160 --> 2:16:54.160]  And you know what, if anybody else had said that, it would have been front-page news for weeks
[2:16:54.160 --> 2:16:59.160]  Because remember going back to Dan Quill, the old Quill just misspelled the word potato
[2:16:59.160 --> 2:17:01.160]  And they didn't let him live it down
[2:17:01.160 --> 2:17:04.160]  But Obama gets a free ride no matter what's going on
[2:17:04.160 --> 2:17:10.160]  I think he just stepped too far when he was commenting on this incident with the police officer the other day
[2:17:10.160 --> 2:17:17.160]  I think this might, with everything else, and as you said Alex, all his promises are turning into fiction at this point
[2:17:17.160 --> 2:17:21.160]  Because he talks out of both sides of his mouth, but that's not why I'm there
[2:17:21.160 --> 2:17:24.160]  I'm there to enforce the U.S. Constitution
[2:17:24.160 --> 2:17:29.160]  I'm there for the 305 million people in this country who deserve to know the truth
[2:17:29.160 --> 2:17:34.160]  I'm there for our forefathers, and I'm there for the 1.5 million men and women
[2:17:34.160 --> 2:17:38.160]  Who have died over the years fighting in various wars to protect their constitution
[2:17:38.160 --> 2:17:41.160]  In addition, there's another 1.5 million who are wounded
[2:17:41.160 --> 2:17:45.160]  That's over 3 million men and women have died or been wounded
[2:17:45.160 --> 2:17:49.160]  Fighting to protect this constitution which Obama's trying to tear apart
[2:17:50.160 --> 2:17:55.160]  You know, Mr. Berg, I don't want to get into conspiracy theories
[2:17:55.160 --> 2:18:03.160]  But are they planning this so they can then have to have an amendment to make a foreign born president for Schwarzenegger?
[2:18:03.160 --> 2:18:11.160]  I mean, if they knew he was born in Kenya, and this was so unbelievable for me that I had trouble
[2:18:11.160 --> 2:18:16.160]  Even though I know you're a credible person in really getting my mind around this
[2:18:16.160 --> 2:18:21.160]  And then as the cover-up expanded and now they won't release any of his college records and his foundation records
[2:18:21.160 --> 2:18:28.160]  And his mother's records and his father's records, and they guard them like it's the Kennedy assassination
[2:18:28.160 --> 2:18:33.160]  You know, records or something, I mean, they're certainly acting suspicious
[2:18:33.160 --> 2:18:38.160]  And now they're on TV going, we're scared, you know, these crazies won't listen to us
[2:18:38.160 --> 2:18:41.160]  We've given them the records when they haven't given us the records
[2:18:41.160 --> 2:18:50.160]  And they would have just released the stinking birth certificate and this cover-up of saying they have released all his records when it's not true
[2:18:50.160 --> 2:18:56.160]  I've got to tell you, Mr. Berg, you know, I will take my time making a decision about something
[2:18:56.160 --> 2:19:01.160]  And I'm not sure I'll hold back, but in time, in the fullness of time, hindsight's 20-20 as they say
[2:19:01.160 --> 2:19:07.160]  I've got to tell you, my gut and all the intellectual evidence tells me he was born in Kenya
[2:19:07.160 --> 2:19:14.160]  It fits in with his dad, the madrasas growing up in Indonesia, his real name's Barry Sotero
[2:19:14.160 --> 2:19:22.160]  Everything about this guy is fake, how could the CIA, how could the Justice Department, how could the government let him become president
[2:19:22.160 --> 2:19:24.160]  Knowing this would come out?
[2:19:24.160 --> 2:19:33.160]  Well, first off, I've been advised by some high people over in Britain that our FBI and CIA know the truth about him
[2:19:33.160 --> 2:19:41.160]  But there's no reporting, when you run for president, there's nobody you have to check in and show that you are who you are
[2:19:41.160 --> 2:19:45.160]  But think about it, he's committed fraud in every one of the states
[2:19:45.160 --> 2:19:50.160]  Unless he can show us documentation that he has legally changed his name after being adopted in Indonesia
[2:19:50.160 --> 2:19:54.160]  By signing his name as Barack Hussein Obama, that would be fraud
[2:19:54.160 --> 2:19:58.160]  Stay there, yeah, like in your great legal mind, he's done hundreds of things
[2:19:58.160 --> 2:20:00.160]  We'll cover him when we come back
[2:20:00.160 --> 2:20:04.160]  You worry, if you don't, you don't understand the situation
[2:20:04.160 --> 2:20:07.160]  Hi, summer's coming and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency
[2:20:07.160 --> 2:20:11.160]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants, remember, there's a learning curve
[2:20:11.160 --> 2:20:14.160]  Experience is the best teacher, but that means time
[2:20:14.160 --> 2:20:17.160]  To speed it up, you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it
[2:20:17.160 --> 2:20:19.160]  Author Linda Runyon is that teacher
[2:20:19.160 --> 2:20:22.160]  Her wild food knowledge package is the Crash Course
[2:20:22.160 --> 2:20:26.160]  The DVD gives you a three-hour overview of her world directly from her
[2:20:26.160 --> 2:20:30.160]  The book gives you an in-depth reference with all of the insider know-how you'll ever need
[2:20:30.160 --> 2:20:34.160]  And her wild cards are your portable summary and cheat sheet for your fieldwork
[2:20:34.160 --> 2:20:39.160]  This three-pronged learning system will take you from spectator to scholar to gourmet survivalist
[2:20:39.160 --> 2:20:41.160]  In weeks, not years
[2:20:41.160 --> 2:20:43.160]  Folks, I can vouch that Linda's the real deal
[2:20:43.160 --> 2:20:45.160]  She's my mom and I watched her do it
[2:20:45.160 --> 2:20:50.160]  So go to ofthefield.com or call 888-51eatfree
[2:20:50.160 --> 2:20:52.160]  Start now, knowledge is power
[2:20:52.160 --> 2:20:55.160]  Better take action, I think a storm's coming
[2:20:55.160 --> 2:20:59.160]  Hi, this is John Swenson again at Midas Resources, and let me ask just one question
[2:20:59.160 --> 2:21:03.160]  What would you list as the things that the federal government does really well?
[2:21:03.160 --> 2:21:06.160]  The armed forces and printing bogus money doesn't count
[2:21:06.160 --> 2:21:11.160]  Now take that blank page of yours and list the ways that you have to protect your assets
[2:21:11.160 --> 2:21:13.160]  And escape the paper markets
[2:21:13.160 --> 2:21:15.160]  The only real option is precious metals
[2:21:15.160 --> 2:21:19.160]  For your retirement, your kid's education, or just plain survival
[2:21:19.160 --> 2:21:25.160]  When the whole Obama mess comes crashing down
[2:21:25.160 --> 2:21:29.160]  You are the only one you can count on for a stimulus package
[2:21:29.160 --> 2:21:33.160]  And I'd like to discuss a proven strategy to create that safety net for you and your family
[2:21:33.160 --> 2:21:37.160]  Please give me a call at 800-686-2237
[2:21:37.160 --> 2:21:42.160]  Extension 128, that's 800-686-2237
[2:21:42.160 --> 2:21:46.160]  Extension 128, and together we can develop a Make Sense program
[2:21:46.160 --> 2:21:50.160]  Before the clock runs out
[2:21:50.160 --> 2:21:54.160]  Once more, John Swenson at 800-686-2237
[2:21:54.160 --> 2:22:22.160]  Extension 128, and take charge of your future and thank you
[2:22:22.160 --> 2:22:26.160]  Obama's already fudging, fudged since day one in this election
[2:22:26.160 --> 2:22:30.160]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[2:22:30.160 --> 2:22:36.160]  Who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs
[2:22:36.160 --> 2:22:38.160]  That's fascism
[2:22:38.160 --> 2:22:41.160]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one-world government
[2:22:41.160 --> 2:22:48.160]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda

[2:22:56.160 --> 2:23:22.160]  The Obama Deception, the people strike back
[2:23:22.160 --> 2:23:48.160]  The Obama Deception, the people strike back
[2:23:48.160 --> 2:24:14.160]  The Obama Deception, the people strike back
[2:24:14.160 --> 2:24:19.160]  All right, as usual folks, I'm just ranting because for a year or more
[2:24:19.160 --> 2:24:24.160]  I've been looking and studying the birthday issue and you have scales
[2:24:24.160 --> 2:24:30.160]  And early on there was more evidence that he was born in Kenya than that he was born in Hawaii
[2:24:30.160 --> 2:24:36.160]  And having a fake name and covering up his history and saying he doesn't have Muslim roots
[2:24:36.160 --> 2:24:41.160]  I'm not saying that's bad, but lying about it and now saying he does have Muslim roots
[2:24:41.160 --> 2:24:46.160]  And saying he's a Muslim on TV and speech after speech and saying it was an accident later
[2:24:46.160 --> 2:24:49.160]  Probably done on purpose
[2:24:49.160 --> 2:24:53.160]  And just all his deception and covering up the college records
[2:24:53.160 --> 2:24:56.160]  But Attorney Phil Berg has gone over the Constitution Bill of Rights
[2:24:56.160 --> 2:25:00.160]  Him lying, lying on entrance forms
[2:25:00.160 --> 2:25:05.160]  You were getting to that, Mr. Berg, the first lawyer to speak up, the first guy to file suits
[2:25:05.160 --> 2:25:09.160]  You were getting into all the lies we know he's told
[2:25:09.160 --> 2:25:11.160]  How you were saying he should be prosecuted for fraud
[2:25:11.160 --> 2:25:13.160]  Get into that
[2:25:13.160 --> 2:25:16.160]  Well, I think, first off, let me say this
[2:25:16.160 --> 2:25:21.160]  Significant is the fact that this has been around on the internet for over two years
[2:25:21.160 --> 2:25:27.160]  Significant is the fact that in June 2008, two months before I got involved in this
[2:25:27.160 --> 2:25:33.160]  On the Obama campaign website, they put this document which they keep trying to say is a birth certificate
[2:25:33.160 --> 2:25:36.160]  It's not, it's a certification of live birth
[2:25:36.160 --> 2:25:40.160]  And our expert has determined that it's on our website, ObamaCrimes.com
[2:25:40.160 --> 2:25:42.160]  That the document is a phony
[2:25:42.160 --> 2:25:44.160]  It's a fraud, it's been altered
[2:25:44.160 --> 2:25:49.160]  First off, so when I filed my, I got a phone call at the beginning of August 2008
[2:25:49.160 --> 2:25:52.160]  From an individual I've worked with for years, a young lady, Linda
[2:25:52.160 --> 2:25:56.160]  And she said, Phil, have you heard about this Obama not being a natural-worn citizen?
[2:25:56.160 --> 2:25:58.160]  I said, absolutely, do you know about it?
[2:25:58.160 --> 2:25:59.160]  I said, not too much
[2:25:59.160 --> 2:26:00.160]  She said, well, check it out
[2:26:00.160 --> 2:26:01.160]  She said, it's for real
[2:26:01.160 --> 2:26:03.160]  He's not natural-worn
[2:26:03.160 --> 2:26:08.160]  He has no business being president and Phil, you're the only attorney in the country with breasts
[2:26:08.160 --> 2:26:11.160]  You know what, to Sue Obama
[2:26:11.160 --> 2:26:13.160]  So I looked into it and two weeks later I sued Obama
[2:26:13.160 --> 2:26:16.160]  I sued him August 21, 2008
[2:26:16.160 --> 2:26:20.160]  That's significant because that was before the Democratic National Convention
[2:26:20.160 --> 2:26:24.160]  I sued Obama and not only Obama, I sued the Democratic National Committee
[2:26:24.160 --> 2:26:25.160]  Think about it, Al
[2:26:25.160 --> 2:26:28.160]  Two different roles, Obama wanted to be president
[2:26:28.160 --> 2:26:31.160]  But the Democratic National Committee, of course, wanted a Democrat as president
[2:26:31.160 --> 2:26:33.160]  But they had a higher duty, in my opinion
[2:26:33.160 --> 2:26:37.160]  And that is to convey to the American public that they have a qualified candidate
[2:26:37.160 --> 2:26:40.160]  I expected them to do something they didn't
[2:26:40.160 --> 2:26:42.160]  Because they didn't respond before the convention
[2:26:42.160 --> 2:26:46.160]  He got nominated, he had his big thing at the football stadium
[2:26:46.160 --> 2:26:49.160]  And a month later they filed their joint motion to dismiss
[2:26:49.160 --> 2:26:53.160]  Which infuriated me, it just showed that there was collusion between both of them
[2:26:53.160 --> 2:26:55.160]  And I really mean that
[2:26:55.160 --> 2:27:01.160]  So when I filed suit August 21, it was significant and I put out a press release
[2:27:01.160 --> 2:27:06.160]  I said Obama, if I am incorrect, prove me wrong
[2:27:06.160 --> 2:27:11.160]  Show me your long form, your bold copy of your birth certificate
[2:27:11.160 --> 2:27:13.160]  And I'll walk away, I'll go away
[2:27:13.160 --> 2:27:18.160]  And did he show that to me?
[2:27:18.160 --> 2:27:20.160]  No, he didn't show that to me
[2:27:20.160 --> 2:27:22.160]  What did he do?
[2:27:22.160 --> 2:27:24.160]  Nothing, he didn't respond to that
[2:27:24.160 --> 2:27:28.160]  Which is significant, and the bold copy for your list is different
[2:27:28.160 --> 2:27:32.160]  The bold copy of your birth certificate, and those that have a real birth certificate will know
[2:27:32.160 --> 2:27:36.160]  A bold copy has the weight of the baby, the length of the baby
[2:27:36.160 --> 2:27:41.160]  It has the hospital name, the doctor's name, the doctor's signature
[2:27:41.160 --> 2:27:46.160]  All of these things which I just mentioned are not on this certification of live birth
[2:27:46.160 --> 2:27:50.160]  And a certification of live birth, back then, they might have changed it recently in Hawaii
[2:27:50.160 --> 2:27:55.160]  What it's going to be used for, but back then, you could not even register your child for Little League
[2:27:55.160 --> 2:27:58.160]  You couldn't get a passport on it
[2:27:58.160 --> 2:28:05.160]  You couldn't even get a land grant in Hawaii based upon that
[2:28:05.160 --> 2:28:08.160]  And they keep trying to shove it down our throat
[2:28:08.160 --> 2:28:12.160]  Like you had Chris Matthews on MSNBC where he was waving in front of the camera
[2:28:12.160 --> 2:28:14.160]  Well, hey Chris, watch when you're waving
[2:28:14.160 --> 2:28:16.160]  You're not waving a birth certificate
[2:28:16.160 --> 2:28:18.160]  Stop being phony out there
[2:28:18.160 --> 2:28:23.160]  I'm covering it more and more because I think part of what happened with Congressman Cassel in Delaware
[2:28:23.160 --> 2:28:26.160]  He held a town meeting on June 30, 2009
[2:28:26.160 --> 2:28:30.160]  And the woman stood up and said, here's my birth certificate
[2:28:30.160 --> 2:28:32.160]  Basically, where's Obama's birth certificate?
[2:28:32.160 --> 2:28:36.160]  The congressman said that he is a citizen, the whole audience booed
[2:28:36.160 --> 2:28:38.160]  And since then it's really taken off
[2:28:38.160 --> 2:28:42.160]  Well, that was the point I was going to make, and we're going to play that video when we come back in the next segment
[2:28:42.160 --> 2:28:49.160]  Or part of it, is that this was spontaneous and now other videos are surfacing with Democrat and Republican congressman
[2:28:49.160 --> 2:28:55.160]  Being booed and whole crowds are spontaneously angry, even Democrats
[2:28:55.160 --> 2:29:00.160]  This is a massive underground issue, probably the biggest issue
[2:29:00.160 --> 2:29:05.160]  Because I think at a fundamental level, but you're the expert, give me your inside take on this
[2:29:05.160 --> 2:29:09.160]  I don't think anybody's got their finger on the pulse of this, like Phil Berg is online with us right now
[2:29:09.160 --> 2:29:13.160]  But when we come back, I want to ask you, and we're going to play this clip
[2:29:13.160 --> 2:29:19.160]  The big question, is the main issue that people are insulted by being padded on the head and said
[2:29:19.160 --> 2:29:24.160]  We've shown you the birth certificate, sit down and shut up when
[2:29:24.160 --> 2:29:28.160]  Kenyan newspapers are saying he was born over there and they're proud of it
[2:29:28.160 --> 2:29:32.160]  His grandmother's running around on video saying he was born over there
[2:29:32.160 --> 2:29:35.160]  His dad lived over there
[2:29:35.160 --> 2:29:42.160]  He's got his cousin starting riots over there with Obama advising him in the Senate how to do it
[2:29:42.160 --> 2:29:49.160]  You've got Obama operating under another name, lying on college forms, sealing everything
[2:29:49.160 --> 2:29:51.160]  What's making folks so upset?
[2:29:51.160 --> 2:29:55.160]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run
[2:29:55.160 --> 2:30:01.160]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network

[2:30:14.160 --> 2:30:18.160]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family
[2:30:18.160 --> 2:30:20.160]  In any emergency, if you simply prepare
[2:30:20.160 --> 2:30:23.160]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation, but you

[2:31:07.160 --> 2:31:16.160]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water
[2:31:16.160 --> 2:31:21.160]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases
[2:31:21.160 --> 2:31:23.160]  Now what are you going to do about it?

[2:33:29.160 --> 2:33:36.160]  Going back last year, I said it looked like they were recovering up and he was probably born in Kenya
[2:33:36.160 --> 2:33:41.160]  or certainly his mother didn't live in the United States long enough, they have laws on that
[2:33:41.160 --> 2:33:45.160]  to be able to then him to be president
[2:33:45.160 --> 2:33:49.160]  because you can't just have one parent who's a US citizen too and be president
[2:33:49.160 --> 2:33:56.160]  so we'll break that down with the expert Phil Berg here in just a moment and take your phone calls
[2:33:56.160 --> 2:34:01.160]  and play this video that's getting so much attention, but everywhere I go
[2:34:01.160 --> 2:34:05.160]  people come up to me in grocery store lines and they say, Alex, what's going on with the birth certificate?
[2:34:05.160 --> 2:34:11.160]  And I go, he lies about everything, his name, Barack Obama, isn't even his real name
[2:34:11.160 --> 2:34:14.160]  He's covering it up, why hasn't he released it?
[2:34:14.160 --> 2:34:20.160]  Why before this was an issue did they post the fake certificate, the receipt?
[2:34:20.160 --> 2:34:29.160]  See, I mean, as an investigator and anybody who's researched any basic criminology, this really looks bad
[2:34:29.160 --> 2:34:38.160]  but again, to say we're kooks and nuts and bad to want it to be released, we're not bad, he needs to prove it
[2:34:38.160 --> 2:34:43.160]  I mean, you got to show this to get a driver's license or to get on welfare or to join the military
[2:34:43.160 --> 2:34:47.160]  but not to be president, going to Phil Berg in just a moment, I want to tell you about some of the sponsors

[2:37:15.160 --> 2:37:21.160]  okay going now to our esteemed guest Obama crimes.com I really appreciate his courage
[2:37:21.160 --> 2:37:29.160]  his doggedness his stick to itness and his instinct to get on this case and before we interview Mr. Berger
[2:37:29.160 --> 2:37:35.160]  a year ago about this more than a year ago he'd say well I'm a Democrat I like Obama I just
[2:37:35.160 --> 2:37:42.160]  you know where there's smoke there's fire now a lot more has come out run through before we go to calls
[2:37:42.160 --> 2:37:48.160]  more of the evidence of the cover up and the fact that this is building and that that well that first question
[2:37:48.160 --> 2:37:56.160]  before hit the break Mr. Berg why is it now exploding is it the way the media just dismisses everybody
[2:37:56.160 --> 2:38:03.160]  and the way Obama's been caught lying about so much other stuff well I think it's because number one
[2:38:03.160 --> 2:38:09.160]  Obama is dropping in the polls he's not coming through on the various proposals he said he was going to be the candidate of change
[2:38:09.160 --> 2:38:15.160]  and then when you said I think he's even set himself up to be blackmailed and I think he could be blackmailed already
[2:38:15.160 --> 2:38:21.160]  think about it candidate of change his cabinet is 70% Bill Clinton who's the Secretary of Defense
[2:38:21.160 --> 2:38:28.160]  Bill Gates left over from Bush does that even make sense it doesn't make sense and when he recently
[2:38:28.160 --> 2:38:36.160]  talked about reducing the restrictions on travel to Cuba perhaps Cuba perhaps Castro has a copy of his documentation
[2:38:36.160 --> 2:38:42.160]  what happens when China and Russia get it what happens when Iran gets it because you know these papers are around there
[2:38:42.160 --> 2:38:47.160]  and you know some of these foreign governments they'll pay a million dollars for it but talking about a million dollars
[2:38:47.160 --> 2:38:55.160]  why would Obama you know I gotta stop you Phil incredible point all the time they catch clerks at DMVs selling
[2:38:55.160 --> 2:39:01.160]  10,000 fake driver's license 3,000 bucks apiece they're getting millions they're constantly catching federal clerks
[2:39:01.160 --> 2:39:09.160]  selling data you better believe foreign governments would pay 10 million bucks for the proof absolutely
[2:39:09.160 --> 2:39:16.160]  what happens when Iran gets the proof what's that going to cost us and perhaps that's why when Obama travels overseas
[2:39:16.160 --> 2:39:20.160]  every place he's going has been apologizing for the United States we should get power
[2:39:20.160 --> 2:39:26.160]  what about battling before the king of Saudi Arabia unbelievable unbelievable and did the media make a big thing about that
[2:39:26.160 --> 2:39:34.160]  not at all he gets a free ride like I said I wish we could do the national media I think though because of what's happening at these town meetings
[2:39:34.160 --> 2:39:40.160]  that tape went out and other people now are being questioned about it it's now spreading out to more and more people
[2:39:40.160 --> 2:39:46.160]  like you said people must show their own your listeners have to show their birth certificate for little league
[2:39:46.160 --> 2:39:51.160]  for driver's license for college for marriage different things in different states but for a passport
[2:39:51.160 --> 2:39:57.160]  why is Obama getting a free ride you know somebody said he loves it he he loves being out there with this
[2:39:57.160 --> 2:40:02.160]  because it diverts attention by the things I disagree with that person the other day on the air on a different show
[2:40:02.160 --> 2:40:07.160]  he doesn't want this thing he had hoped it would go away with this document two months before I got into it
[2:40:07.160 --> 2:40:14.160]  and I'm proud to say that I'm glad I got into it because since I have it's mushroomed into lawsuits all across this country
[2:40:14.160 --> 2:40:20.160]  which didn't get the media attention but there's now getting media attention because you have congressmen
[2:40:20.160 --> 2:40:27.160]  like when congressmen introduced a new bill a new piece of legislation which he's got seven other Republicans
[2:40:27.160 --> 2:40:33.160]  the Republican they introduced it saying that in the out of the year 2012 anyone running for president
[2:40:33.160 --> 2:40:39.160]  should have to show proof that they are a natural born citizen well why are no Democrats joining into that
[2:40:39.160 --> 2:40:46.160]  because they all know that he's not natural born they won't join into it because that's when Obama plans to run for re-election
[2:40:46.160 --> 2:40:53.160]  but I hope to legally remove him from office before that we're not in the context of only in a financial crisis in this country
[2:40:53.160 --> 2:40:59.160]  we have a constitutional crisis think about it every law that he's signed every appointment that he's made
[2:40:59.160 --> 2:41:06.160]  is avoid avoidable and look what he's doing now to even bypass congress he's appointing his czars
[2:41:06.160 --> 2:41:12.160]  I think he's up to 19 czars or something like that each czar is going to spend 10 to 20 million dollars for their staff
[2:41:12.160 --> 2:41:17.160]  because a czar doesn't have to it's not a cabinet person doesn't have to go through the scrutiny of the senate
[2:41:17.160 --> 2:41:24.160]  not that the scrutiny of the congress is so good anymore because just of what they've done here
[2:41:24.160 --> 2:41:30.160]  they've been giving a rubber stamp to this guy and to this grace and that's why the three lawsuits pending
[2:41:30.160 --> 2:41:36.160]  the case is significant right now I mentioned the Hollister case but the significant one is for your listeners
[2:41:36.160 --> 2:41:42.160]  I filed a case that was sealed back on November 7th 2008 and I couldn't talk about it
[2:41:42.160 --> 2:41:48.160]  it wasn't sealed because I filed against Obama it was sealed because it was filed under what's called the false claims act
[2:41:48.160 --> 2:41:53.160]  or QUITEM Q-U-I-T-A-M all false claims act cases are sealed
[2:41:53.160 --> 2:41:57.160]  the basic false claims act comes against for Medicaid and Medicare fraud
[2:41:57.160 --> 2:42:01.160]  it's like one of your listeners right now their neighborhoods ripping off the government
[2:42:01.160 --> 2:42:07.160]  so they would file this action against the neighbor and they would now file on behalf of themselves
[2:42:07.160 --> 2:42:11.160]  and as the relator on behalf of the United States government
[2:42:11.160 --> 2:42:15.160]  the government is served but your neighbor is not served
[2:42:15.160 --> 2:42:18.160]  so in my case the government was served but Obama was not served
[2:42:18.160 --> 2:42:22.160]  it gives the government 60 days to review the case to make one of three decisions
[2:42:22.160 --> 2:42:24.160]  one that they will prosecute the case
[2:42:24.160 --> 2:42:28.160]  two that the relator can prosecute the case on behalf of the government
[2:42:28.160 --> 2:42:31.160]  or three to close out the case and not prosecute me
[2:42:31.160 --> 2:42:35.160]  well very few cases are closed but what happened in my case when I filed it
[2:42:35.160 --> 2:42:40.160]  number one the 60 days stretched into about six months because they got extensions
[2:42:40.160 --> 2:42:43.160]  they filed filed for a motion to dismiss the action
[2:42:43.160 --> 2:42:44.160]  I filed it
[2:42:44.160 --> 2:42:47.160]  interesting case when we went to court because it was a sealed case
[2:42:47.160 --> 2:42:48.160]  I couldn't talk about it
[2:42:48.160 --> 2:42:52.160]  the actual when the attorneys arrived in the room everyone there they locked the door
[2:42:52.160 --> 2:42:54.160]  the windows in the back were actually covered
[2:42:54.160 --> 2:42:56.160]  I mean this was called sealed case
[2:42:56.160 --> 2:42:59.160]  at the end of the prison the judge walks out and says
[2:42:59.160 --> 2:43:04.160]  I just wanted to know Mr. Burke that this is the DC court of the DC federal court
[2:43:04.160 --> 2:43:06.160]  and the DC court of appeals
[2:43:06.160 --> 2:43:09.160]  they have their own court of appeals because there's so many cases against the government
[2:43:09.160 --> 2:43:12.160]  has ruled that I can give no input in this case
[2:43:12.160 --> 2:43:14.160]  so at the end of your presentation
[2:43:14.160 --> 2:43:17.160]  it'll be up to the government whether they want to proceed or not
[2:43:17.160 --> 2:43:19.160]  how outrageous is the head route
[2:43:19.160 --> 2:43:21.160]  so what I did is I did proceed
[2:43:21.160 --> 2:43:23.160]  well for those that don't know hold on Mr. Burke
[2:43:23.160 --> 2:43:25.160]  you're dropping bombshell after bombshell
[2:43:25.160 --> 2:43:28.160]  so they're not even following proper judicial proceedings
[2:43:28.160 --> 2:43:32.160]  they've now turned it into a pure kangaroo court
[2:43:32.160 --> 2:43:35.160]  with the judge saying my hands are tied
[2:43:35.160 --> 2:43:37.160]  I mean that right there lets us know
[2:43:37.160 --> 2:43:39.160]  this is thermal nuclear level
[2:43:39.160 --> 2:43:43.160]  they're definitely desperate to cover this up
[2:43:43.160 --> 2:43:45.160]  well you have to know on that
[2:43:45.160 --> 2:43:47.160]  they said that before me they said
[2:43:47.160 --> 2:43:49.160]  force claims act they can't have input
[2:43:49.160 --> 2:43:51.160]  different than the Ninth Circuit in California
[2:43:51.160 --> 2:43:53.160]  because the law and I'll go along with the Ninth Circuit
[2:43:53.160 --> 2:43:56.160]  because it says that the relator can have a hearing
[2:43:56.160 --> 2:43:58.160]  well if you're going to have a hearing
[2:43:58.160 --> 2:44:00.160]  and the hearing's in front of the judge
[2:44:00.160 --> 2:44:02.160]  why would you have a hearing with no input from the judge
[2:44:02.160 --> 2:44:03.160]  it doesn't make sense
[2:44:03.160 --> 2:44:05.160]  so what I did is after that they ruled against me
[2:44:05.160 --> 2:44:07.160]  I thought a motion for reconsideration
[2:44:07.160 --> 2:44:10.160]  we looked further and we found a statute
[2:44:10.160 --> 2:44:12.160]  called conflict of interest
[2:44:12.160 --> 2:44:14.160]  and Eric Holder is in a definite conflict of interest
[2:44:14.160 --> 2:44:16.160]  well you should have seen the reply from the government
[2:44:16.160 --> 2:44:19.160]  so he has to recuse himself but obviously he doesn't
[2:44:19.160 --> 2:44:21.160]  right we have to recuse himself
[2:44:21.160 --> 2:44:24.160]  either appoint me let me proceed with the case
[2:44:24.160 --> 2:44:26.160]  or if they want further questions about the case
[2:44:26.160 --> 2:44:28.160]  they'll appoint a special prosecutor
[2:44:28.160 --> 2:44:30.160]  their response was believe it or not
[2:44:30.160 --> 2:44:33.160]  well Eric Holder hasn't signed any of the pleadings in this case
[2:44:33.160 --> 2:44:36.160]  who's your boss you assistant
[2:44:36.160 --> 2:44:38.160]  who's your boss
[2:44:38.160 --> 2:44:40.160]  is there a conflict of interest in Eric Holder
[2:44:40.160 --> 2:44:43.160]  number one he was on Obama's campaign committee
[2:44:43.160 --> 2:44:46.160]  number two he was one of the few individuals named
[2:44:46.160 --> 2:44:48.160]  to select the vice president for Obama
[2:44:48.160 --> 2:44:50.160]  and number three he's now the attorney general
[2:44:50.160 --> 2:44:53.160]  which is the person responsible
[2:44:53.160 --> 2:44:55.160]  to enforce the laws in this country
[2:44:55.160 --> 2:44:57.160]  and also the person who gives advice to the president
[2:44:57.160 --> 2:44:59.160]  now if that's not conflict of interest
[2:44:59.160 --> 2:45:01.160]  I don't know what it is
[2:45:01.160 --> 2:45:03.160]  this now I've asked for a hearing
[2:45:03.160 --> 2:45:05.160]  and in the next few weeks we should have an open hearing
[2:45:05.160 --> 2:45:07.160]  in DC
[2:45:07.160 --> 2:45:09.160]  okay Phil in the time we've got left
[2:45:09.160 --> 2:45:11.160]  because you've got your again finger on the pulse of this
[2:45:11.160 --> 2:45:14.160]  more than anybody out there
[2:45:14.160 --> 2:45:16.160]  as best you can tell
[2:45:16.160 --> 2:45:19.160]  from your deep research and all your sources out there
[2:45:19.160 --> 2:45:22.160]  what's the real
[2:45:22.160 --> 2:45:24.160]  chain of events born in Kenya
[2:45:24.160 --> 2:45:26.160]  when did he come to the US
[2:45:26.160 --> 2:45:28.160]  why is he covering up the college papers
[2:45:28.160 --> 2:45:31.160]  and where do you see all this going
[2:45:31.160 --> 2:45:33.160]  how do you see this playing out
[2:45:33.160 --> 2:45:35.160]  well it's gonna be tough unless we get the public behind us
[2:45:35.160 --> 2:45:37.160]  because right now the courts aren't getting us
[2:45:37.160 --> 2:45:39.160]  letting us have a discovery
[2:45:39.160 --> 2:45:41.160]  I mean the court in Philadelphia that case
[2:45:41.160 --> 2:45:43.160]  which is coming up for a hearing in October
[2:45:43.160 --> 2:45:46.160]  the third circuit deals with the fact that I don't have standing
[2:45:46.160 --> 2:45:48.160]  with that for your list as they mean I don't have standing
[2:45:48.160 --> 2:45:50.160]  Alex Jones doesn't have standing
[2:45:50.160 --> 2:45:52.160]  and none of you listening to the show has standing
[2:45:52.160 --> 2:45:54.160]  a US citizen doesn't have standing to enforce the Constitution
[2:45:54.160 --> 2:45:56.160]  which is asinine
[2:45:56.160 --> 2:45:58.160]  as in that asinine
[2:45:58.160 --> 2:46:00.160]  especially the 10th amendment where it goes back to we the people
[2:46:00.160 --> 2:46:03.160]  the second the Hollister case is a good case
[2:46:03.160 --> 2:46:05.160]  and then we'll try to get him on the air with you
[2:46:05.160 --> 2:46:07.160]  that's the Air Force Colonel saying
[2:46:07.160 --> 2:46:09.160]  can I obey your order
[2:46:09.160 --> 2:46:11.160]  or can I legally disobey your order
[2:46:11.160 --> 2:46:13.160]  because you're a usurper
[2:46:13.160 --> 2:46:15.160]  and the third one which is the pressing one
[2:46:15.160 --> 2:46:17.160]  which hopefully we'll be hearing soon on this false claim act
[2:46:17.160 --> 2:46:19.160]  in that case though I filed a little different
[2:46:19.160 --> 2:46:21.160]  that was Berg vs. Souturo
[2:46:21.160 --> 2:46:23.160]  because I'm claiming in that case
[2:46:23.160 --> 2:46:25.160]  that Barry Souturo
[2:46:25.160 --> 2:46:27.160]  is an illegal alien
[2:46:27.160 --> 2:46:29.160]  therefore his three and a half years as US Senator
[2:46:29.160 --> 2:46:31.160]  was a fraud
[2:46:31.160 --> 2:46:33.160]  and therefore his salary and benefits of over a million dollars
[2:46:33.160 --> 2:46:35.160]  should come back to the US Treasury
[2:46:35.160 --> 2:46:37.160]  so for them not to allow me to proceed
[2:46:37.160 --> 2:46:39.160]  if we proceed in that case
[2:46:39.160 --> 2:46:41.160]  as soon as we get discovery in any case
[2:46:41.160 --> 2:46:43.160]  we'll have Obama
[2:46:43.160 --> 2:46:45.160]  will have to be out of office
[2:46:45.160 --> 2:46:47.160]  I am sure
[2:46:47.160 --> 2:46:49.160]  if he was born in Hawaii
[2:46:49.160 --> 2:46:51.160]  he would have produced his vault copy of his birth certificate
[2:46:51.160 --> 2:46:53.160]  people say the governor saw
[2:46:53.160 --> 2:46:55.160]  the officials there
[2:46:55.160 --> 2:46:57.160]  if you look at their statements very carefully
[2:46:57.160 --> 2:46:59.160]  and I'll send you a copy of a letter you can post it
[2:46:59.160 --> 2:47:01.160]  if you want to attend the Lou Dobb to clear his act up
[2:47:01.160 --> 2:47:03.160]  they never said
[2:47:03.160 --> 2:47:05.160]  they said they saw a birth certificate
[2:47:05.160 --> 2:47:07.160]  they never said it's from Hawaii
[2:47:07.160 --> 2:47:09.160]  and if it wasn't they would have said it
[2:47:09.160 --> 2:47:11.160]  you would have seen it
[2:47:11.160 --> 2:47:13.160]  his records at colleges are sealed
[2:47:13.160 --> 2:47:15.160]  because I'm sure it's a show that he applied for
[2:47:15.160 --> 2:47:17.160]  and received foreign aid
[2:47:17.160 --> 2:47:19.160]  well it's more than that
[2:47:19.160 --> 2:47:21.160]  I have a copy of my vault
[2:47:21.160 --> 2:47:23.160]  it's like stamped on there
[2:47:23.160 --> 2:47:25.160]  it's not the receipts
[2:47:25.160 --> 2:47:27.160]  that everybody gets and uses
[2:47:27.160 --> 2:47:29.160]  for regular business
[2:47:29.160 --> 2:47:31.160]  and it's such a simple thing
[2:47:31.160 --> 2:47:33.160]  I think everybody because they have a birth certificate
[2:47:33.160 --> 2:47:35.160]  knows that when they're being shown a receipt
[2:47:35.160 --> 2:47:37.160]  and told you're stupid this is a birth certificate
[2:47:37.160 --> 2:47:39.160]  that it insults their intelligence
[2:47:39.160 --> 2:47:41.160]  and then they find out about the Barry Satoro
[2:47:41.160 --> 2:47:43.160]  and his dad
[2:47:43.160 --> 2:47:45.160]  and the communism
[2:47:45.160 --> 2:47:47.160]  and here's the bigger question
[2:47:47.160 --> 2:47:49.160]  we know Phil the establishment
[2:47:49.160 --> 2:47:51.160]  isn't going to let somebody in like this
[2:47:51.160 --> 2:47:53.160]  knowing this unless they plan to use it
[2:47:53.160 --> 2:47:55.160]  the more I look at it
[2:47:55.160 --> 2:47:57.160]  it looks like they picked him
[2:47:57.160 --> 2:47:59.160]  and chose him just because
[2:47:59.160 --> 2:48:01.160]  he was so compromised
[2:48:01.160 --> 2:48:03.160]  and they've known this the whole time
[2:48:03.160 --> 2:48:05.160]  and just wanted to hold it over his head
[2:48:05.160 --> 2:48:07.160]  and then now you and millions of others
[2:48:07.160 --> 2:48:09.160]  are sabotaging their little game plan
[2:48:09.160 --> 2:48:11.160]  and you can say well
[2:48:11.160 --> 2:48:13.160]  they'll ignore us in the courts
[2:48:13.160 --> 2:48:15.160]  and the world that they could put up some
[2:48:15.160 --> 2:48:17.160]  billboards
[2:48:17.160 --> 2:48:19.160]  and the issue is
[2:48:19.160 --> 2:48:21.160]  in the court of public opinion
[2:48:21.160 --> 2:48:23.160]  I think this is one of the other things
[2:48:23.160 --> 2:48:25.160]  that is destroying him right now
[2:48:25.160 --> 2:48:27.160]  so we're going to convict him
[2:48:27.160 --> 2:48:29.160]  either way because he continues
[2:48:29.160 --> 2:48:31.160]  to cover up the truth
[2:48:31.160 --> 2:48:33.160]  I think we're going to force
[2:48:33.160 --> 2:48:35.160]  if we can get the number of people to increase
[2:48:35.160 --> 2:48:37.160]  we can
[2:48:37.160 --> 2:48:39.160]  you hit it right on the head
[2:48:39.160 --> 2:48:41.160]  the court of public opinion
[2:48:41.160 --> 2:48:43.160]  let's say we get 75 million people
[2:48:43.160 --> 2:48:45.160]  to follow Alex Jones Pilburg
[2:48:45.160 --> 2:48:47.160]  if we can on a certain day say tomorrow
[2:48:47.160 --> 2:48:49.160]  everyone should call the White House
[2:48:49.160 --> 2:48:51.160]  switchboard and demand to see the birth of them
[2:48:51.160 --> 2:48:53.160]  we can blow out their switchboard
[2:48:53.160 --> 2:48:55.160]  the next day we can call ABC, NBC, CBS
[2:48:55.160 --> 2:48:57.160]  we can ask people to email letters
[2:48:57.160 --> 2:48:59.160]  we can get very easy
[2:48:59.160 --> 2:49:01.160]  I think it's five or six people to stand at a major intersection
[2:49:01.160 --> 2:49:03.160]  he's holding a sign so it spells out
[2:49:03.160 --> 2:49:05.160]  Obama where is your birth certificate
[2:49:05.160 --> 2:49:07.160]  at a busy intersection
[2:49:07.160 --> 2:49:09.160]  we could do this off of obamacrimes.com
[2:49:09.160 --> 2:49:11.160]  a busy intersection at rush hour
[2:49:11.160 --> 2:49:13.160]  could hit between five and twenty thousand
[2:49:13.160 --> 2:49:15.160]  people depending on how they do it
[2:49:15.160 --> 2:49:17.160]  regardless this is
[2:49:17.160 --> 2:49:19.160]  a practice action
[2:49:19.160 --> 2:49:21.160]  in mass mobilization
[2:49:21.160 --> 2:49:23.160]  and taking action this is how we save
[2:49:23.160 --> 2:49:25.160]  the country
[2:49:25.160 --> 2:49:27.160]  again I go back to what you said Phil
[2:49:27.160 --> 2:49:29.160]  they will not release the original birth certificate
[2:49:29.160 --> 2:49:31.160]  and this game
[2:49:31.160 --> 2:49:33.160]  of
[2:49:33.160 --> 2:49:35.160]  telling us that we don't have a right
[2:49:35.160 --> 2:49:37.160]  to see it or that we've seen
[2:49:37.160 --> 2:49:39.160]  it isn't going to work let's play this clip
[2:49:39.160 --> 2:49:41.160]  of this congressman where this one lady
[2:49:41.160 --> 2:49:43.160]  gets up and then spontaneously
[2:49:43.160 --> 2:49:45.160]  everybody's shouting him down
[2:49:45.160 --> 2:49:47.160]  this shows this issue
[2:49:47.160 --> 2:49:49.160]  is mega viral and this video
[2:49:49.160 --> 2:49:51.160]  is scaring the establishment
[2:49:51.160 --> 2:49:53.160]  they admit they're scared
[2:49:53.160 --> 2:49:55.160]  why are they scared of something that is it true
[2:49:55.160 --> 2:49:57.160]  here it is
[2:49:57.160 --> 2:49:59.160]  let's go

[2:50:49.160 --> 2:50:51.160]  coming up to also talk about Obama
[2:50:51.160 --> 2:50:53.160]  but here's the rast music poll
[2:50:53.160 --> 2:50:55.160]  he's falling below 50
[2:50:55.160 --> 2:50:57.160]  he has the lowest approval rating
[2:50:57.160 --> 2:50:59.160]  of any president in modern history
[2:50:59.160 --> 2:51:01.160]  at this point in his administration
[2:51:01.160 --> 2:51:03.160]  with food prices soaring to all time highs
[2:51:03.160 --> 2:51:05.160]  as the dollar continues to fall in value
[2:51:05.160 --> 2:51:07.160]  what can you and your family do

[2:55:00.160 --> 2:55:20.160]  If you're referring to the President there, he is a citizen of the United States.
[2:55:20.160 --> 2:55:46.160]  Hi folks, that's enough. You can watch the rest of it up on infowars.com or prismplanet.com.
[2:55:46.160 --> 2:55:52.160]  In fact, show folks a smaller bubble of that video so they can see the title of it and find out for themselves on YouTube or on the web.
[2:55:52.160 --> 2:55:57.160]  It's titled, Maccastle on Peebo's Birth Certificate.
[2:55:57.160 --> 2:56:08.160]  Now, the issue here, and this one version has 700,000 views, or to be technical, 697,000 views.
[2:56:08.160 --> 2:56:19.160]  The issue here, this is what's scaring the establishment, is they all start chanting and standing up and screaming at him in a spontaneous verbal riot almost.
[2:56:19.160 --> 2:56:33.160]  I think that shows the numbers are bigger than 25 million people. You've had a random congressional event with Congressman Castle that the majority, and I'm watching those people closely, get up and are screaming.
[2:56:33.160 --> 2:56:43.160]  And you notice he said he is a citizen. Yeah, you can be a citizen and be born in Austria. Arnold Schwarzenegger is a citizen, but he's not eligible to be President.
[2:56:43.160 --> 2:57:05.160]  Phil Berg.
[2:57:05.160 --> 2:57:21.160]  Why doesn't he refer to his black grandmother? He only referred to his white grandmother who died right before the November election.
[2:57:21.160 --> 2:57:36.160]  Why doesn't he take care of all his family? I got family that I help out some. He doesn't even care about brothers. He doesn't care about grandmothers. I mean, that right there, boy, this is not a very compassionate person.
[2:57:36.160 --> 2:57:50.160]  Well, his aunt is living in Boston. I tried to visit with her, but she wouldn't talk to me about being in Boston, who's here as an illegal alien. And I think that's the same status as Obama. His half brother is living in Kenya in a dollar a month.
[2:57:50.160 --> 2:58:06.160]  I mean, he gave, supposedly, Odingna, his cousin over there, he gave over a million dollars. Odingna lost the election, but then he burned down churches with people in it, and they finally put him in office to stop some of the death and destruction that was happening.
[2:58:06.160 --> 2:58:21.160]  And that's the other issue. You're not just saying that, Phil. I mean, the Senate letters from Obama advising how to riot. He's like a savage revolutionary. My God, he's setting up a dictatorship. Phil, stay there five more minutes. We'll take a few calls from William, David, Ron, and Daniel.
[2:58:21.160 --> 2:58:41.160]  I have quick questions, folks, for Phil Burr. We're going to have Phil Burr back up again next week. And yes, the last interview for the new Obama film is Phil Burr. We're going to interview him this weekend. So that will be in the new film as well. This is huge. Stay with us.
[2:58:41.160 --> 2:58:51.160]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade. We are the GCN radio network.
[2:58:51.160 --> 2:59:00.160]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[2:59:00.160 --> 2:59:11.160]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[2:59:11.160 --> 2:59:18.160]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[2:59:18.160 --> 2:59:25.160]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages.
[2:59:25.160 --> 2:59:35.160]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a long time sponsor of ours.
[2:59:35.160 --> 2:59:54.160]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com. Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet. So go to mysolarbackup.com or call toll free 877-327-0365.
[2:59:54.160 --> 3:00:01.160]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCM radio network.
[3:00:01.160 --> 3:00:24.160]  Obama's approval rating plunging. No president, even Jimmy Carter and George W. Bush, went down to below 50 in the first seven, eight months. This is an all-time low.
[3:00:24.160 --> 3:00:33.160]  We'll cover that later. Take a few calls here. We're having backup next week so you can talk to him more.
[3:00:33.160 --> 3:00:39.160]  For Phil Berg, ObamaCrimes.com. William N. Delaware, you're on the air with Phil Berg. Go ahead.
[3:00:39.160 --> 3:00:54.160]  I want to thank Phil for taking on the legal aspect of this whole situation. And Alex, I want to thank you and Jason and Luke out there for showing me what a powerful weapon that video camera is.
[3:00:54.160 --> 3:01:10.160]  Because without that, there wasn't anybody else down there that day actually recording this stuff. And I stuck four or five different videos from the footage that I got there that day and put them out there and that one just took off.
[3:01:10.160 --> 3:01:14.160]  Wait, wait. The footage of what? Footage of Phil Berg?
[3:01:14.160 --> 3:01:26.160]  No. I'm the creator of the woman in the red shirt video here in Delaware. Wow. What a small world. So you're saying you're one of my listeners. You learned from us.
[3:01:26.160 --> 3:01:30.160]  I'm an official info warrior, Alex, and I'm proud to be one.
[3:01:30.160 --> 3:01:47.160]  Wow. And now this thing's got millions of millions of views, hundreds of different versions, some of them 700, some of them 500,000 views a piece. Phil, how exciting that the guy that shot the video, hey, what was it like seeing this huge spontaneous awakening where, I mean, you were in that crowd.
[3:01:47.160 --> 3:01:53.160]  It looks like from the video that like 80, 90% of the people are yelling, yeah, yeah. I mean, what is your...
[3:01:53.160 --> 3:02:14.160]  It was about that. And let me stage for this thing. This was a town hall listening tour that was going to be about healthcare. He put it three days after his vote for cap and trade. 80 to 90% of the people that were there were there because of his vote for that cap and trade bill.
[3:02:14.160 --> 3:02:26.160]  Well, listen, William, I want to say right now, we will put it in the film if you will send us the footage of that lady and make the point because it'd be higher quality. Can I put you on hold and give you our FedEx number?
[3:02:26.160 --> 3:02:28.160]  And will you let us use that in the new Obama film?
[3:02:28.160 --> 3:02:48.160]  Absolutely. And I've got one other thing to plug. After the meeting, I got up one-on-one with my castle and the audio is not great on it, but it's actually posted as a video response to this first one. And I'm asking him about a forced vaccination bill, whether he would vote for it.
[3:02:48.160 --> 3:03:03.160]  He flip-flops on it. And eventually at the end, he says, yes, under certain circumstances, he would vote to forcibly vaccinate us. And it wouldn't be a violation of the Fourth Amendment, which frankly, I think is disgusting.
[3:03:03.160 --> 3:03:13.160]  This is incredible. You know what, William? I'm going to put you on hold right now and get your name and number. And I'm going to call you in a little while and give you our FedEx number.
[3:03:13.160 --> 3:03:26.160]  And I'd like to have you on for maybe 10, 15 minutes next time next week when we do two hours on this subject. But look, every time I turn around, it is our listeners that are trailblazing on every big issue.
[3:03:26.160 --> 3:03:30.160]  William, you warm my heart. You made my day. God bless you.
[3:03:30.160 --> 3:03:37.160]  Hey, thanks, Alex. And I also want to put a plug out to the Oathkeepers because I'm constantly pushing those guys for our students.
[3:03:37.160 --> 3:03:43.160]  We'll do that, but we got to say bye. Look, I'll just have you back on. Get his name and number, John.
[3:03:43.160 --> 3:03:48.160]  Phil, I'm going to have you back up next week. My team's coming up this weekend to interview you for the film.
[3:03:48.160 --> 3:03:56.160]  But in closing, and I meant to get to other calls, but that caller had, look at what a small world it is that is one of our listeners that did that.
[3:03:56.160 --> 3:03:57.160]  That's wonderful.
[3:03:57.160 --> 3:04:08.160]  Now, the big thing is, if everyone can go to my website and send it to everyone on their address book, obamacrimes.com, listeners go to it, send it to everyone on your address book, and they ask them to send it on and on and on.
[3:04:08.160 --> 3:04:16.160]  And if you can make a contribution to us as closely, we want to get signboards up that mean something. We want signs going up Obama. Where's your birth certificate?
[3:04:16.160 --> 3:04:27.160]  We want to have bumper stickers or metal things you can put on the side of the car and say, Obama, where's your birth certificate? Not this easy way out saying where's your birth certificate?
[3:04:27.160 --> 3:04:30.160]  So obamacrimes.com is the place to go, everyone.
[3:04:30.160 --> 3:04:42.160]  Absolutely. People should support you. You're doing invaluable work, and I want to have you on next week for an hour or more with the Colonel, who you're representing, and to cover a lot more at obamacrimes.com.
[3:04:42.160 --> 3:04:50.160]  Mr. Berg, thank you so much for spending time with us, and I'm going to have my producer call you in about 20 minutes to lock down that interview time.

[3:08:01.160 --> 3:08:20.160]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show because there's a war on for your mind.
[3:08:20.160 --> 3:08:30.160]  Well, it's atlawworldwide. He has millions of people that listen to his sermons and watch what he has to do. He's a very popular pastor.
[3:08:30.160 --> 3:08:35.160]  Reverend James Manning, the chief pastor at Atlaw World Missionary Church.
[3:08:35.160 --> 3:08:45.160]  Manning graduated from the College of New Rochelle with a Bachelor of Arts degree and continued to the Union Theological Seminary in the city of New York where he has awarded Master of Divinity.
[3:08:45.160 --> 3:08:52.160]  Manning also holds a Doctor of Philosophy degree from the Theology Seminary and Unaccredited Educational Institution.
[3:08:52.160 --> 3:09:03.160]  Manning achieved some controversy in 2008 presidential election after he posted several sermons of his that were harshly critical Democratic candidate Barack Obama on the website YouTube.
[3:09:03.160 --> 3:09:12.160]  So that's kind of the view of him from Wikipedia, but you never know about Wikipedia. They got my name spelled wrong and half the stuff on there is a lie about me.
[3:09:12.160 --> 3:09:17.160]  So we have the man himself who I think is very focused, articulate and also very angry.
[3:09:17.160 --> 3:09:22.160]  In fact, early on he was really critical of Obama and I wasn't sure about Obama.
[3:09:22.160 --> 3:09:30.160]  You know, I wasn't a big fan of Bush and a lot of stuff Obama said he wanted to do. I agreed with, but then he's lied about everything.
[3:09:30.160 --> 3:09:38.160]  And now his approval rating has gone from 84 in a Rasmussen poll to 49. Nobody's has ever fallen that fast.
[3:09:38.160 --> 3:09:45.160]  Now it's coming out that the majority of people think he was really born in Kenya. He's such a liar. Who knows if that's true.
[3:09:45.160 --> 3:09:49.160]  We just covered it with Mr. Berg earlier. They won't release the original birth certificate.
[3:09:49.160 --> 3:09:58.160]  Anybody who criticizes him gets called a racist. It's creating all this racial division and this is getting really scary.
[3:09:58.160 --> 3:10:08.160]  So I wanted to get the view from a critical black American pastor of Barack Obama on multi fronts.
[3:10:08.160 --> 3:10:13.160]  We've had people on black Americans who like him with people like KRS-1, hip hop sensation.
[3:10:13.160 --> 3:10:17.160]  Day one said, I see a scam coming a mile, you know, away.
[3:10:17.160 --> 3:10:25.160]  And as I said, when Obama first got elected, I said, I feel bad because when it turns out that this guy is a fraud like most politicians,
[3:10:25.160 --> 3:10:32.160]  it's going to be turned into a racial issue. So to give us his take on this is a fellow who's ended up in Oliver Fox seeing in, you name it.
[3:10:32.160 --> 3:10:41.160]  Quite a big controversy. Dr. James David Manning. Pastor, it's good to have you on here with us, sir.
[3:10:41.160 --> 3:10:50.160]  Well, Alex, it's good to be here as well. I'm really honored to be on your broadcast. I've heard a lot about you.
[3:10:50.160 --> 3:10:58.160]  And I've seen what they've done to you on YouTube. I've heard all about it. But I'm glad to be on the broadcast today.
[3:10:58.160 --> 3:11:07.160]  Let me also add this. I am traveling and I'm not in my office. And so I had to stop at a restaurant to make this call.
[3:11:07.160 --> 3:11:09.160]  So you may hear some exterior noises.
[3:11:09.160 --> 3:11:15.160]  I totally understand. You're on the road. Came on on short notice. We'll have you back up from the studio in the near future.
[3:11:15.160 --> 3:11:17.160]  You've got the floor, sir.
[3:11:17.160 --> 3:11:27.160]  Well, again, you know, your intro kind of says it all. I was very much aware of Obama from day one, if you will.
[3:11:27.160 --> 3:11:35.160]  Checking out him as a person, what his spirit was all about. And was able to deal with that.
[3:11:35.160 --> 3:11:43.160]  But I first began to try to deal with the African American or black community, whatever it is that, you know, black folks prefer to be called.
[3:11:43.160 --> 3:11:50.160]  I realized who he was and that the presidential campaign was on the way.
[3:11:50.160 --> 3:12:02.160]  I tried to say to the black folk, especially since the church that the Lord has let me pastor for the last 27 years is in Harlem, New York.
[3:12:02.160 --> 3:12:14.160]  And of course, black folk have been so enamored with Bill Clinton and labeled him Tony Marsden and Maya Angelou had stated that he was the first black president.
[3:12:14.160 --> 3:12:17.160]  No black president could ever be better than Bill Clinton.
[3:12:17.160 --> 3:12:32.160]  And then, of course, back in 2001, the black caucus of Congress got together and put together a resolution there in the House determining that Bill Clinton was first black president.
[3:12:32.160 --> 3:12:38.160]  And then I saw them turning from their commitment to the Clintons to Obama.
[3:12:38.160 --> 3:12:42.160]  And I am not a Clinton supporter. I was very much against Clinton.
[3:12:42.160 --> 3:12:49.160]  But the entire eight years he was in office, people just didn't pick up on me the way they did with Obama.
[3:12:49.160 --> 3:12:59.160]  But I was trying to say to the black people in Harlem and nationwide that it represented a sense of absence of loyalty, the absence of integrity.
[3:12:59.160 --> 3:13:04.160]  And it just kind of mushroomed from there as I began to watch the campaign unfold.
[3:13:04.160 --> 3:13:14.160]  Well, otla.org is the website where folks can actually watch and listen to the unedited sermons.
[3:13:14.160 --> 3:13:22.160]  The mainstream media has taken out a context and kind of boiled down and misrepresented some of what you've said here in your own words, sir.
[3:13:22.160 --> 3:13:24.160]  It's got international attention.
[3:13:24.160 --> 3:13:27.160]  What is your basic take on Obama?
[3:13:27.160 --> 3:13:28.160]  What he's done?
[3:13:28.160 --> 3:13:30.160]  Where this is going?
[3:13:30.160 --> 3:13:40.160]  I found sermons of you 9, 10, 11 months ago saying this is going to end in disaster when the media was acting like Jesus had returned and we were all saved.
[3:13:40.160 --> 3:13:46.160]  How did you instinctively or I guess spiritually or from research know this was going to end so bad?
[3:13:46.160 --> 3:13:53.160]  Because it really is. I'm following the trajectory. He is falling like a shooting star right now.
[3:13:53.160 --> 3:13:59.160]  Well, I was spiritually aware of him, Alex, early on.
[3:13:59.160 --> 3:14:23.160]  Biblically from the time I was a young boy growing up down in North Carolina hearing the preachers preach about one that was going to come and would purport to solve all the world's problems and that the world would be so enamored and in love with him that they would indeed worship him
[3:14:23.160 --> 3:14:32.160]  and that he would be extremely charismatic, that he would be handsome and the whole world would bow down before him.
[3:14:32.160 --> 3:14:36.160]  I heard these sermons preach years ago when I was just a boy.
[3:14:36.160 --> 3:14:55.160]  And when Obama came, I realized that he fit the bills of the sermons that had been preached early years early about preachers who had no idea who this person would be, what race they would come from, or even what period in which he would show up.
[3:14:55.160 --> 3:15:01.160]  Now, are you saying he's a prototype as the Bible says? Many Antichrist spirit? Or are you saying he could be the big one?
[3:15:01.160 --> 3:15:06.160]  That's exactly what I'm saying. That is exactly what I'm saying.
[3:15:06.160 --> 3:15:34.160]  And while you're right about his following the trajectory of Obama's rise and fall, he has fallen in point over the last couple of weeks, more specifically, but I'll say this to you and be well advised that the grip that Obama has on the world, the grip that Obama has on the white liberals, if you don't mind,
[3:15:34.160 --> 3:15:42.160]  The grip that Obama has on the black people will not win. Now, he has lost some points to be sure.
[3:15:42.160 --> 3:15:52.160]  Media has done just a little bit of a turn on him, not much, not enough to make a real difference. As you know, they worship this man, I mean, they really...
[3:15:52.160 --> 3:16:01.160]  But you're saying he can certainly pull some rabbits out of hats and stage some crises. So where do you see this going with Obama? What's the bottom line?
[3:16:01.160 --> 3:16:10.160]  I see it going into a revolution or a civil war in America. That's exactly what's on the agenda.
[3:16:10.160 --> 3:16:17.160]  And that's the only thing that's going to get our nation back. You are not going to get this nation back from Obama through the vote.
[3:16:17.160 --> 3:16:35.160]  I can tell you that now, through putting in Congress persons, putting in senators, and rearranging the House in 2010, you're not going to take this nation back from Obama. He has deeply implanted inside people in strategic locations, offices, etc.
[3:16:35.160 --> 3:16:42.160]  That will make it not impossible to take this nation back. It's going to have to be...
[3:16:42.160 --> 3:16:54.160]  I guess the thing is that he is federally seizing giant corporations, having Homeland Security take over all the federal agencies. He really is grabbing control of everything.
[3:16:54.160 --> 3:17:01.160]  So even if people wake up, it won't matter. So you're saying he's going to attempt to set up a dictatorship?
[3:17:01.160 --> 3:17:16.160]  The only thing that he has not done yet, he has done, we've seen the seizing of General Motors, he wants healthcare. If he can get healthcare, one-sixth of the American economy, and then he can force everybody's lives.
[3:17:16.160 --> 3:17:34.160]  Senator Orrin had said the other day, in the Senate Finance Committee, what they were trying to put together to present to Obama, the long-legged Mac Daddy, that's what I call him, that he was so ticked off with what they were strategizing to do there in that Senate Finance Committee, he walked out of there.
[3:17:34.160 --> 3:17:49.160]  And what he said, and it did not meant his words, what he said was that they were really trying to propose a plan that would be a government takeover. They're not looking just for healthcare for the 46 million people that don't have healthcare.
[3:17:49.160 --> 3:17:59.160]  Obama wants a complete government takeover of the entire healthcare industry. At that point, he says who lives, who dies.
[3:17:59.160 --> 3:18:10.160]  Well, look at the cap and trade where the feds can take over any business or even private home. That's in the bill. And then Obama lies and says it isn't in there. I mean, this is crazy.
[3:18:10.160 --> 3:18:28.160]  But if you give him cap and trade, where he controls the energy, he can control any business, walk into any business, shut it down at any time he wants, or funnel billions of federal dollars into any business he wants to follow them through. How are you going to get him out by voting? You can't do that. I mean, he'll control everything.
[3:18:28.160 --> 3:18:45.160]  The only thing he hasn't started doing yet, which I suspect will happen in not too many days or months, will be the beginning of the arresting of people or people being pursued by RS investigations. That's next on the horizon.
[3:18:45.160 --> 3:19:00.160]  Well, Pastor, actually, during the campaign, you probably know in Missouri and other states, they would go on the news and say, if you lie about him and we're going to decide, no judge or jury, the police are going to arrest you. And now they're trying to pass the hate crimes law where they arrest you for your speech.
[3:19:00.160 --> 3:19:17.160]  Yes, absolutely. That's the next. That's the thing. One of the things I'm concerned about, you know, as I preach and speak, I mean, I'm a prime candidate to be hauled off to jail. I mean, kick my door in the middle of the night and take me off the jail.
[3:19:17.160 --> 3:19:33.160]  And nobody knows where I'm at. You know, that's coming. Listen, we cannot anybody who thinks if you're an American, you've been around American politics and at the time, if you think that this nation is not headed for a confrontation revolution.
[3:19:33.160 --> 3:19:50.160]  If you think that this nation can be taken back from Obama with just voting him out, you've got nothing coming. I can't imagine where you've been. This has got to go to the American people rising up and saying, we're not taking this yet. We're going to take our nation back.
[3:19:50.160 --> 3:20:01.160]  All right, Pastor Manning, stay there. We've got a final segment with you. How you see this revolution unfolding. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[3:20:01.160 --> 3:20:06.160]  It is a big idea. A New World Order.
[3:20:06.160 --> 3:20:11.160]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[3:20:11.160 --> 3:20:16.160]  It's known as the Bilderberg. Could their objective be world domination?
[3:20:16.160 --> 3:20:30.160]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[3:20:30.160 --> 3:20:39.160]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open. You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[3:20:39.160 --> 3:20:42.160]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[3:20:42.160 --> 3:20:47.160]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power. Yes, they're after music.

[3:23:16.160 --> 3:23:24.160]  Electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge, creating a cascade of power outages across the country, putting us all in the dark.
[3:23:24.160 --> 3:23:36.160]  Are you prepared for the next round of storm related outages or government created blackouts? Have you ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid and generate your own private supply of electrical power?
[3:23:36.160 --> 3:23:48.160]  If so, this will be the most important information you have ever heard. Solar power generators are finally available. They have no moving parts to wear out or break and require absolutely no gas whatsoever.

[3:24:01.160 --> 3:24:12.160]  All right, your calls are coming up in the next segment. We'll have Dr. Reverend James Manning up for a full hour in the near future. He's on the road today.
[3:24:12.160 --> 3:24:27.160]  Sir, you got the floor the last five minutes of this segment. Quick segment. We were talking intensely during the break about how he came from nowhere, all those points you made, now his actions, now the police state, and what you see happening in America. Go ahead.
[3:24:27.160 --> 3:24:45.160]  Obama's rise to power has never had a person, no one has ever in the history of this nation risen as quickly as Obama and has become the most powerful man in the world, and we don't even know where he was born.
[3:24:45.160 --> 3:24:57.160]  We don't know where he was born. We don't know who his father is. We really don't know. Now, we've gotten reports, but this man at present is the most powerful man on this planet.
[3:24:57.160 --> 3:25:17.160]  And right now, I've stated some time ago that Hitler's power was nothing compared to Obama's power, because Germany was not as a powerful nation during the time of the social democratic status of Germany and Hitler. America is a mega nation.
[3:25:17.160 --> 3:25:27.160]  And Obama has all this power. If Hitler had all this power, my God, the riff will be gone by that. 10,000 nukes. Yeah, Obama's got 10,000 nukes.
[3:25:27.160 --> 3:25:39.160]  There is nobody, there has never been a situation such as this. His birth certificate, whether he's a U.S. citizen or not, everybody knows that he isn't. Everybody knows that he isn't.
[3:25:39.160 --> 3:25:49.160]  So are you saying early on in your spirit, because I know you did videos when he wasn't even, I mean, you were saying you were worried about him day one. Was that in your gut?
[3:25:49.160 --> 3:25:51.160]  Absolutely. From that point on.
[3:25:51.160 --> 3:25:57.160]  Okay, what do you see happening in the future dealing with martial law and revolution?
[3:25:57.160 --> 3:26:09.160]  In the audience, Alex, I am not an alarmist. I am not some person. I'm not chicken little. The sky is falling. I've prayed that people don't perceive me that way. I've been a pastor for 27 years.
[3:26:09.160 --> 3:26:23.160]  I've served the Harlem community with the earnestness of my love and my love for Jesus. I'm preaching the gospel. But martial law, the arresting of people, the reason why all of these things are going to happen
[3:26:23.160 --> 3:26:36.160]  is many Americans across America are beginning to realize that we are facing all we have at present, the most diabolical person sitting in the Oval Office.
[3:26:36.160 --> 3:26:47.160]  There are people in this nation who are going to rise up and they're forming right now in small groups all over America. They're listening and they're watching.
[3:26:47.160 --> 3:26:55.160]  But at some point, you're going to see an uprising. In order to stop this, Obama will probably begin to arrest people.
[3:26:55.160 --> 3:27:11.160]  And under martial law, events such as 9-11 or some other event in America can give Obama sweeping powers to shut down the Constitution, to shut down all agencies and arrest or imprison anybody he wants to.
[3:27:11.160 --> 3:27:14.160]  Are you saying he may stage something?
[3:27:14.160 --> 3:27:25.160]  I'm saying it's possible if he feels that the matter of the American people is strong enough and resentment to begin to destroy him, to pull him down. I think that he will.
[3:27:25.160 --> 3:27:32.160]  And the other thing that we need to know that I have not said this, I'm saying this for the very first time on your broadcast. I don't mean to be self-promoting anything.
[3:27:32.160 --> 3:27:50.160]  The other thing, as God gives it to me, I want to say it, is that we have not, Alex, we have not really began to pantom how diabolical this man is, that if he sees himself going down, that he'll take the world down with him.
[3:27:50.160 --> 3:28:06.160]  We are looking at a narcissistic, we're looking at a man who is so, I suppose, hung up on himself, so diabolical, that he would not hesitate to stage an event in order that he might be able to create martial law.
[3:28:06.160 --> 3:28:21.160]  But on the other hand, if he saw himself being defeated in a bunker mentality, there is no telling what he'll do to destroy this nation. That is to say, to create a major world crisis and he would go out in flames.
[3:28:21.160 --> 3:28:24.160]  If you understand what I'm saying, I know that sounds a bit...
[3:28:24.160 --> 3:28:41.160]  I know, I understand, sir, and it looks like they're setting that up with the economic crisis, the staged flu, all this stuff is really concerning me, and it does look like revolution's in the air to all this, and it seems like they want people to rebel.
[3:28:41.160 --> 3:28:46.160]  It seems like they want, I mean, they're clearly going for broke right now.
[3:28:46.160 --> 3:28:57.160]  I think that Obama, in his brilliance, realizes, because he is maniacal and diabolical and insidious, is that he cannot deal with it.
[3:28:57.160 --> 3:29:15.160]  But the truth of the matter is, America is a great nation, it's a nation that God Almighty has blessed, and Americans are going to stand up again and put their lives on the line, and in order for him to deal with that, it's going to result to the things that we're discussing at present.
[3:29:15.160 --> 3:29:23.160]  What I want to say in that statement is that this is a strong nation and it's going to rise up again for Obama.
[3:29:23.160 --> 3:29:35.160]  All right, well God bless you, Dr. James Manning, otla.org, a-t-l-a-h dot o-r-g, or just Google James David Manning, and you will find it.
[3:29:35.160 --> 3:29:39.160]  We'll talk to you for a full hour when you get back off the road, back to Harlem.
[3:29:39.160 --> 3:29:41.160]  God bless you, sir, and it was good speaking with you.
[3:29:41.160 --> 3:29:45.160]  God bless you, and I was honored to be on your show, thank you so very much for having me.
[3:29:45.160 --> 3:29:51.160]  Honored to have you, I just am attracted to the pastor spirit, I just, good guy.

[3:30:01.160 --> 3:30:06.160]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[3:30:06.160 --> 3:30:13.160]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick, go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[3:30:13.160 --> 3:30:16.160]  You don't have to cooperate, there is a solution.

[3:31:05.160 --> 3:31:07.160]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[3:31:07.160 --> 3:31:15.160]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[3:31:15.160 --> 3:31:21.160]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune and developmental system diseases.
[3:31:21.160 --> 3:31:23.160]  Now what are you going to do about it?

[3:31:34.160 --> 3:31:40.160]  and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.

[3:33:24.160 --> 3:33:28.160]  Many a soldier shed his life blood on my blade.
[3:33:28.160 --> 3:33:32.160]  You know, as Willie Nelson, what's your favorite song ever sung?
[3:33:32.160 --> 3:33:36.160]  He said, this one right here, and this is my favorite.
[3:33:36.160 --> 3:33:38.160]  But I am still alive.
[3:33:38.160 --> 3:33:39.160]  Good stuff.
[3:33:42.160 --> 3:33:44.160]  What's funny, Hartman?
[3:33:44.160 --> 3:33:47.160]  I was born upon the land.
[3:33:47.160 --> 3:33:49.160]  It's like Joker fell in there.
[3:33:49.160 --> 3:33:53.160]  It's Jared Nighart. It's also a comedian. It's his night job.
[3:33:53.160 --> 3:33:56.160]  So there's like an endless comedian, I think, of Williamson.
[3:34:00.160 --> 3:34:03.160]  That's Chris Christoperson coming up to Wayland Jennings.
[3:34:03.160 --> 3:34:05.160]  That part's really good.
[3:34:05.160 --> 3:34:07.160]  Crank him, Wayland Jennings.
[3:34:07.160 --> 3:34:11.160]  And then we'll go ahead and let you hear Mr. Cash.
[3:34:11.160 --> 3:34:14.160]  Then I'm going to your phone calls and a bunch of other news.
[3:34:14.160 --> 3:34:15.160]  Stay with us.
[3:34:15.160 --> 3:34:17.160]  I was a damper.
[3:34:17.160 --> 3:34:20.160]  I was a dam builder.
[3:34:20.160 --> 3:34:24.160]  Across the slimy deep and wild.
[3:34:24.160 --> 3:34:28.160]  We're stealing what it did collide.
[3:34:28.160 --> 3:34:30.160]  Place called Boulder. Wild Colorado.
[3:34:30.160 --> 3:34:35.160]  Place called Boulder on the wild Colorado.
[3:34:35.160 --> 3:34:39.160]  I slipped and fell into the well-concrete below.
[3:34:39.160 --> 3:34:41.160]  That's where Jared's going, the well-concrete below.
[3:34:41.160 --> 3:34:47.160]  They're redeeming that great tune that knows no sound.
[3:34:47.160 --> 3:34:50.160]  But I'm still around.
[3:34:50.160 --> 3:34:56.160]  I'll always be around, around, around, around, around.
[3:34:56.160 --> 3:34:58.160]  Hi, here's Johnny Cash from the grave.
[3:34:58.160 --> 3:34:59.160]  Forever.
[3:34:59.160 --> 3:35:01.160]  Bless Johnny Cash.
[3:35:01.160 --> 3:35:05.160]  I bless John Wayne.
[3:35:05.160 --> 3:35:12.160]  I'll fly a starship across the universe divide.
[3:35:12.160 --> 3:35:17.160]  And when I reach the other side,
[3:35:17.160 --> 3:35:21.160]  I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can.
[3:35:21.160 --> 3:35:23.160]  Good stuff.
[3:35:23.160 --> 3:35:28.160]  Perhaps I may become a highwayman again.
[3:35:28.160 --> 3:35:30.160]  All right, let's go to your calls.
[3:35:30.160 --> 3:35:32.160]  Now I'm going to blitz news.
[3:35:32.160 --> 3:35:36.160]  Ron in Arizona, you are on the air. Welcome.
[3:35:36.160 --> 3:35:38.160]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[3:35:38.160 --> 3:35:39.160]  Hey, buddy.
[3:35:39.160 --> 3:35:41.160]  Two quick points.
[3:35:41.160 --> 3:35:45.160]  First, I'd like to say that Pastor Manning is correct that
[3:35:45.160 --> 3:35:48.160]  Barry Sotero is a type of the Antichrist,
[3:35:48.160 --> 3:35:52.160]  but he cannot be the Antichrist because he's way too old.
[3:35:52.160 --> 3:35:56.160]  When the Antichrist rises to power, he'll be in his 30s.
[3:35:56.160 --> 3:35:59.160]  He'll come out of Iraq. He'll be the ruler of Iraq.
[3:35:59.160 --> 3:36:05.160]  And the Antichrist will now rise to power for at least another 20 years.
[3:36:05.160 --> 3:36:07.160]  So that stuff can be debated.
[3:36:07.160 --> 3:36:08.160]  It's a secular show.
[3:36:08.160 --> 3:36:10.160]  Manning's just been all over CNN, Fox.
[3:36:10.160 --> 3:36:11.160]  You name it.
[3:36:11.160 --> 3:36:14.160]  And when we talked to him, it turned out their ministry's fans of the show.
[3:36:14.160 --> 3:36:18.160]  And so I just wanted as a prominent black preacher who's not
[3:36:18.160 --> 3:36:22.160]  worshiping Barack Obama to get his perspective on Barack Obama.
[3:36:22.160 --> 3:36:28.160]  But you have a good point there, Ron. Anything else?
[3:36:28.160 --> 3:36:33.160]  Yeah, I recently wrote a book explaining this in the New World Order
[3:36:33.160 --> 3:36:34.160]  and all that.
[3:36:34.160 --> 3:36:39.160]  But the second thing is, I think when you talk about Barry Sotero
[3:36:39.160 --> 3:36:43.160]  and his birth certificate where he was born,
[3:36:43.160 --> 3:36:46.160]  if you could bring up the fact that it doesn't matter
[3:36:46.160 --> 3:36:50.160]  because he is not the president of the United States of America.
[3:36:50.160 --> 3:36:56.160]  In 1861, when the Southern congressmen and senators walked out,
[3:36:56.160 --> 3:36:58.160]  the union was dissolved.
[3:36:58.160 --> 3:37:00.160]  No, but sir, sir, I understand all...
[3:37:00.160 --> 3:37:02.160]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[3:37:02.160 --> 3:37:07.160]  But filing straw men and saying that it's a corrupt republic
[3:37:07.160 --> 3:37:11.160]  in the District of Columbia, all of that is based in reality,
[3:37:11.160 --> 3:37:14.160]  but the system just ignores it.
[3:37:14.160 --> 3:37:20.160]  So, yes, you know, you could say that the federal government
[3:37:20.160 --> 3:37:24.160]  was a tyranny since the Civil War, but it's here with us now.
[3:37:24.160 --> 3:37:26.160]  So we got to try to audit the Fed.
[3:37:26.160 --> 3:37:28.160]  We don't just have a problem with the federal government.
[3:37:28.160 --> 3:37:32.160]  The federal government's got global bankers sitting on top of it.
[3:37:32.160 --> 3:37:34.160]  Then here's the federal government, the state governments and us.
[3:37:34.160 --> 3:37:38.160]  We got to get the bankers off the top of the pyramid first
[3:37:38.160 --> 3:37:40.160]  before we cut the federal government down to size.
[3:37:40.160 --> 3:37:44.160]  Up there pulling the levers and flipping the dials
[3:37:44.160 --> 3:37:46.160]  and running the system.
[3:37:46.160 --> 3:37:49.160]  The technocracy is offshore banking cartels.
[3:37:49.160 --> 3:37:51.160]  We've had a corporate takeover.
[3:37:51.160 --> 3:37:54.160]  And so we got to get the bankers out of here first.
[3:37:54.160 --> 3:37:56.160]  Then we can debate all this other stuff.
[3:37:56.160 --> 3:37:58.160]  But I hear you, Ron. Good points there.
[3:37:58.160 --> 3:38:01.160]  Daniel in Oklahoma. Daniel, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[3:38:01.160 --> 3:38:03.160]  Good afternoon, sir.
[3:38:03.160 --> 3:38:06.160]  I had a kind of a request because I've been hearing a lot,
[3:38:06.160 --> 3:38:11.160]  doing a lot of research on the legitimacy of his presidency, Obama's.
[3:38:11.160 --> 3:38:15.160]  And I've actually heard on more than one case
[3:38:15.160 --> 3:38:19.160]  that they removed a video from YouTube and all the Internet
[3:38:19.160 --> 3:38:24.160]  of Barack Obama actually admitting that he wasn't eligible
[3:38:24.160 --> 3:38:26.160]  to be the president of the United States.
[3:38:26.160 --> 3:38:32.160]  And this was when Alan Keyes, when he was doing his campaign for running for the Senate,
[3:38:32.160 --> 3:38:37.160]  he actually, Alan Keyes confronted him backstage and said,
[3:38:37.160 --> 3:38:39.160]  hey, what are you doing this for? You're not eligible.
[3:38:39.160 --> 3:38:41.160]  And he said, well, what does it matter?
[3:38:41.160 --> 3:38:44.160]  I'm not running for the president of the United States.
[3:38:44.160 --> 3:38:47.160]  Well, you know, there's one big problem with that rumor.
[3:38:47.160 --> 3:38:49.160]  And I've heard it and I appreciate your call, Daniel.
[3:38:49.160 --> 3:38:51.160]  And it's okay to bring the point up.
[3:38:51.160 --> 3:38:53.160]  I mean, it's good question to ask.
[3:38:53.160 --> 3:38:56.160]  Alan Keyes would be running around talking about this.
[3:38:56.160 --> 3:39:04.160]  Alan Keyes hates Barack Obama. Ambassador Alan Keyes.
[3:39:04.160 --> 3:39:09.160]  So there's your issue right there.
[3:39:09.160 --> 3:39:15.160]  I mean, I always hear about, I get calls every week on and off here about,
[3:39:15.160 --> 3:39:20.160]  my cousin knows a guy who works at a repair shop who saw a checkpoint
[3:39:20.160 --> 3:39:23.160]  where a truck dumped over full of martial law signs.
[3:39:23.160 --> 3:39:25.160]  I've been hearing that for 14 years.
[3:39:25.160 --> 3:39:28.160]  But I've got mainstream news, martial law preparations,
[3:39:28.160 --> 3:39:33.160]  foreign troops training for gun confiscations and take on the American people,
[3:39:33.160 --> 3:39:35.160]  FEMA press releases in LA09.
[3:39:35.160 --> 3:39:37.160]  We're going to be covering it all week.
[3:39:37.160 --> 3:39:40.160]  And I can't get people to pay attention to it.
[3:39:40.160 --> 3:39:45.160]  The so-called swine flu is clearly manufactured.
[3:39:45.160 --> 3:39:48.160]  Baxter and others put in patents for it a year before it popped up.
[3:39:48.160 --> 3:39:51.160]  They're building mass graves, getting ready for martial law.
[3:39:51.160 --> 3:39:54.160]  I gave you secret documents before it was mainstream news.
[3:39:54.160 --> 3:39:56.160]  Now it's mainstream news.
[3:39:56.160 --> 3:40:00.160]  Still no, I mean, it's still not that big of an issue.
[3:40:00.160 --> 3:40:07.160]  And all I'm saying is Obama could clear all this up by releasing his birth certificate.
[3:40:07.160 --> 3:40:11.160]  Give me, he has, no, he hasn't.
[3:40:11.160 --> 3:40:16.160]  He hasn't released, he's released a certificate.
[3:40:16.160 --> 3:40:19.160]  And now they've waited so long, they could fake one.
[3:40:19.160 --> 3:40:23.160]  I mean, they really, it's getting very, why did he post his birth certificate
[3:40:23.160 --> 3:40:26.160]  before anybody was asking the question or his certificate of birth certificate?
[3:40:26.160 --> 3:40:28.160]  Certificate of live birth.
[3:40:28.160 --> 3:40:31.160]  Oh God, Robert in Texas, Robert, you're on the air.
[3:40:31.160 --> 3:40:32.160]  Go ahead.
[3:40:32.160 --> 3:40:33.160]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[3:40:33.160 --> 3:40:34.160]  Good, sir.
[3:40:34.160 --> 3:40:42.160]  I was, I was broadcast and I was on the air last night talking about the NLE 09,
[3:40:42.160 --> 3:40:47.160]  warning people about the, you know, the foreign troops coming over here.
[3:40:47.160 --> 3:40:52.160]  And I had a listener come into the chat room, posted a link to the Pima website and said,
[3:40:52.160 --> 3:40:55.160]  where does it say anything about foreign troops?
[3:40:55.160 --> 3:40:58.160]  And I said, it's right there in paragraph three.
[3:40:58.160 --> 3:41:02.160]  So I went back to the Pima site and it was gone.
[3:41:02.160 --> 3:41:08.160]  At the bottom of the site, it says last edited on July 24th.
[3:41:08.160 --> 3:41:09.160]  Well, let's check into this.
[3:41:09.160 --> 3:41:15.160]  The top link when you put in national level exercise 2009 is a FEMA link.
[3:41:15.160 --> 3:41:20.160]  And I printed this again last night.
[3:41:20.160 --> 3:41:26.160]  And the guys printed some more on this today, national level exercise 2009.
[3:41:26.160 --> 3:41:34.160]  And it says that they're working with federal agency, state tribal.
[3:41:34.160 --> 3:41:38.160]  And the United States welcomes the participation of Australia, Canada,
[3:41:38.160 --> 3:41:42.160]  Mexico, the United Kingdom and NLE 09.
[3:41:42.160 --> 3:41:46.160]  Then you get into the exercise, which is for counterintelligence, spying on us,
[3:41:46.160 --> 3:41:52.160]  foreign governments helping and practicing quote, taking on terrorists in the United States.
[3:41:52.160 --> 3:41:55.160]  And then here is the press release from FEMA.
[3:41:55.160 --> 3:42:00.160]  FEMA Israeli defense forces, home front command partner for martial law.
[3:42:00.160 --> 3:42:04.160]  And when you go read this, and it's also in newspapers, they say the Israelis,
[3:42:04.160 --> 3:42:07.160]  because they know how to lock down a city, set up checkpoints.
[3:42:07.160 --> 3:42:11.160]  They're training all the major police departments on how to set up checkpoints
[3:42:11.160 --> 3:42:13.160]  and basically turn us into Gaza.
[3:42:13.160 --> 3:42:17.160]  And whether you love Israel or hate Israel, I sure don't want America to be like
[3:42:17.160 --> 3:42:19.160]  Israel, a total police state.
[3:42:19.160 --> 3:42:23.160]  But you know, there's the FEMA official document.
[3:42:23.160 --> 3:42:26.160]  Guys, pull up FEMA.
[3:42:26.160 --> 3:42:29.160]  Just put into Google on screen right now for everybody.
[3:42:29.160 --> 3:42:32.160]  National level exercise 2009.
[3:42:32.160 --> 3:42:33.160]  No, there it is.
[3:42:33.160 --> 3:42:37.160]  It still says, it's, I mean, there it is on screen right here.
[3:42:37.160 --> 3:42:40.160]  Post that on screen for folks watching on prisonplanet.tv.
[3:42:40.160 --> 3:42:44.160]  For folks on the radio, just Google national level exercise NLE 09,
[3:42:44.160 --> 3:42:52.160]  the first links FEMA press release that was put out a few months ago.
[3:42:52.160 --> 3:42:55.160]  And third paragraph says foreign troops right there.
[3:42:55.160 --> 3:42:59.160]  So, sir, I don't know what FEMA sheet you're looking at.
[3:42:59.160 --> 3:43:01.160]  Well, no, I'm looking at the same one you are.
[3:43:01.160 --> 3:43:04.160]  The last sentence was missing last night.
[3:43:04.160 --> 3:43:05.160]  It's back now.
[3:43:05.160 --> 3:43:06.160]  I'm looking at it right now.
[3:43:06.160 --> 3:43:07.160]  It's there.
[3:43:07.160 --> 3:43:10.160]  But if you also look at the bottom of the site, you see where they've been editing
[3:43:10.160 --> 3:43:13.160]  the site also.
[3:43:13.160 --> 3:43:18.160]  Last modified, yeah, Friday, July 24th.
[3:43:18.160 --> 3:43:19.160]  So you're right.
[3:43:19.160 --> 3:43:21.160]  Yeah, they've been in there changing things.
[3:43:21.160 --> 3:43:22.160]  They've been changing things.
[3:43:22.160 --> 3:43:24.160]  So that last sentence was not there last night.
[3:43:24.160 --> 3:43:29.160]  It is back today, which makes me believe that.
[3:43:29.160 --> 3:43:30.160]  Absolutely.
[3:43:30.160 --> 3:43:35.160]  You're getting the word out and, you know, mainstream may be picking up on the
[3:43:35.160 --> 3:43:37.160]  foreign troops, so they had to put it back.
[3:43:37.160 --> 3:43:42.160]  Well, I mean, I remember two months ago, they had drills in Tucson and
[3:43:42.160 --> 3:43:49.160]  Phoenix with Israeli, German, French, Dutch, Australian, British and a bunch of
[3:43:49.160 --> 3:43:54.160]  other, and it said in fighting terrorists and I, the local news said
[3:43:54.160 --> 3:43:58.160]  practicing to fight American militias and I've got army reports all over the
[3:43:58.160 --> 3:43:59.160]  country.
[3:43:59.160 --> 3:44:01.160]  In fact, I showed one in the first hour today.
[3:44:01.160 --> 3:44:02.160]  I'll dig it out in a minute.
[3:44:02.160 --> 3:44:05.160]  This is all going on in the public's in denial.
[3:44:05.160 --> 3:44:07.160]  Folks, we're not making this up.
[3:44:07.160 --> 3:44:08.160]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[3:44:08.160 --> 3:44:12.160]  In fact, guys, pull up the current Nemo story.
[3:44:12.160 --> 3:44:17.160]  FEMA Israeli Defense Forces, Homefront Command Partner, FEMA Israeli Defense
[3:44:17.160 --> 3:44:22.160]  Forces, Homefront Command Partner for Marshall Law, because I want to put this
[3:44:22.160 --> 3:44:24.160]  on screen, not just Curt Nemo's article.
[3:44:24.160 --> 3:44:29.160]  The whole article is hyperlinks to the Department of Homeland Security and to
[3:44:29.160 --> 3:44:31.160]  a FEMA press release.
[3:44:31.160 --> 3:44:32.160]  See right here.
[3:44:32.160 --> 3:44:33.160]  Zoom in.
[3:44:33.160 --> 3:44:36.160]  See people say, oh, that's just info wars or prison planet.
[3:44:36.160 --> 3:44:37.160]  We don't.
[3:44:37.160 --> 3:44:40.160]  We are a hundred times better than the mainstream media.
[3:44:40.160 --> 3:44:42.160]  We link to everything we show.
[3:44:42.160 --> 3:44:44.160]  People ask, well, where do you get your info?
[3:44:44.160 --> 3:44:45.160]  FEMA.gov.
[3:44:45.160 --> 3:44:46.160]  Homeland security.
[3:44:46.160 --> 3:44:48.160]  I mean, look right there.
[3:44:48.160 --> 3:44:50.160]  Israeli troops.
[3:44:50.160 --> 3:44:53.160]  That's the press release link.
[3:44:53.160 --> 3:44:58.160]  In fact, go ahead and put the actual website up on screen and on video for
[3:44:58.160 --> 3:45:02.160]  everybody watching and listening, click on press release.
[3:45:02.160 --> 3:45:06.160]  See the first link and there is the press release.
[3:45:06.160 --> 3:45:10.160]  FEMA administrator, Fugate meets top Israeli officials to discuss emergency
[3:45:10.160 --> 3:45:11.160]  management issues.
[3:45:11.160 --> 3:45:16.160]  And you read the article that says they're involved in these drills.
[3:45:16.160 --> 3:45:19.160]  Then we Googled that and found it was in Arizona.
[3:45:19.160 --> 3:45:24.160]  I go on air, read mainstream articles, but Arizona is saying how great it is to
[3:45:24.160 --> 3:45:27.160]  have foreign troops there and how great it is to have them trained to take on
[3:45:27.160 --> 3:45:28.160]  terrorists.
[3:45:28.160 --> 3:45:31.160]  And then look, I got hundreds of these.
[3:45:31.160 --> 3:45:32.160]  I can't keep track of it.
[3:45:32.160 --> 3:45:34.160]  Here's news tribune.
[3:45:34.160 --> 3:45:36.160]  Guard units trained for attacks.
[3:45:36.160 --> 3:45:38.160]  Camp Crowder, Missouri.
[3:45:38.160 --> 3:45:42.160]  And it says they, they practice repulsing and attack on the base by
[3:45:42.160 --> 3:45:46.160]  militias and on army checkpoints, searching citizens.
[3:45:46.160 --> 3:45:52.160]  And they had army out on highways at mock checkpoints, which always go live.
[3:45:52.160 --> 3:45:53.160]  A videotape.
[3:45:53.160 --> 3:45:57.160]  This I've been there before and others have seen us, sent us the video and
[3:45:57.160 --> 3:46:02.160]  it's got the militias practicing, attacking the troops.
[3:46:02.160 --> 3:46:07.160]  It says militias.
[3:46:07.160 --> 3:46:11.160]  I mean, you can go read this for yourself.
[3:46:11.160 --> 3:46:12.160]  They are practice.
[3:46:12.160 --> 3:46:19.160]  I mean, Google Pentagon prepares to deploy in the U S or brigade homeland tour.
[3:46:19.160 --> 3:46:20.160]  Google that.
[3:46:20.160 --> 3:46:25.160]  And you'll be on army time saying they're preparing to put regular army.
[3:46:25.160 --> 3:46:31.160]  Two months ago, Tennessee, I had the state rep on the army was out randomly
[3:46:31.160 --> 3:46:34.160]  running checkpoints in a four state area.
[3:46:34.160 --> 3:46:36.160]  Tennessee was the only state to say no.
[3:46:36.160 --> 3:46:38.160]  And they told the governor, we're going to do it anyways.
[3:46:38.160 --> 3:46:40.160]  This was in the news.
[3:46:40.160 --> 3:46:42.160]  This is happening.
[3:46:42.160 --> 3:46:46.160]  And they just acclimate and acclimate and acclimate and acclimate and acclimate.
[3:46:46.160 --> 3:46:49.160]  And then we say something and they make fun of us.
[3:46:49.160 --> 3:46:53.160]  You know, I watched real time with Bill Maher this weekend.
[3:46:53.160 --> 3:46:57.160]  I haven't watched it in months and it was all lies.
[3:46:57.160 --> 3:47:00.160]  Just, just in making fun of anybody that talks about this.
[3:47:00.160 --> 3:47:02.160]  And if you don't like Obama, you're a racist.
[3:47:02.160 --> 3:47:05.160]  I get these hundreds of emails a week saying you're a racist.
[3:47:05.160 --> 3:47:09.160]  Folks, I'm not the ones setting up abortuaries in black neighborhoods.
[3:47:09.160 --> 3:47:13.160]  I'm not the one grabbing black foster kids to test chemical and biologicals on them
[3:47:13.160 --> 3:47:14.160]  and radiologicals.
[3:47:14.160 --> 3:47:18.160]  And if your black leaders weren't paid off, they'd be fighting it.
[3:47:18.160 --> 3:47:20.160]  But it's not blacks telling me I'm racist.
[3:47:20.160 --> 3:47:22.160]  It's stupid yuppies.
[3:47:22.160 --> 3:47:25.160]  It's, it's white people.
[3:47:25.160 --> 3:47:27.160]  It's a religion.
[3:47:27.160 --> 3:47:33.160]  You know, by saying you're a racist, if you fight Obama, they can then push his whole agenda through.
[3:47:33.160 --> 3:47:35.160]  You don't want a carbon tax.
[3:47:35.160 --> 3:47:36.160]  You're racist.
[3:47:36.160 --> 3:47:37.160]  You don't want open borders.
[3:47:37.160 --> 3:47:38.160]  You're racist.
[3:47:38.160 --> 3:47:39.160]  You don't want to lose your job.
[3:47:39.160 --> 3:47:40.160]  You're racist.
[3:47:40.160 --> 3:47:44.160]  You don't want the government control and finding you thousands of dollars a year.
[3:47:44.160 --> 3:47:48.160]  If you don't have government health care, I mean, you're a racist.
[3:47:48.160 --> 3:47:52.160]  No, no.
[3:47:52.160 --> 3:47:53.160]  This is tribalism.
[3:47:53.160 --> 3:47:56.160]  They are playing us all off against each other.
[3:47:56.160 --> 3:47:59.160]  You know, tomorrow I'll get more into the whole flu thing.
[3:47:59.160 --> 3:48:01.160]  I prepared a huge folder on all this.
[3:48:01.160 --> 3:48:11.160]  Here is public safety, Canada media relations with the phone number with Canada saying they're taking part in the drill.
[3:48:11.160 --> 3:48:27.160]  And I've got news articles from 2002 where they signed deals with Canadian and Mexican military to quote, use Mexican and Canadian troops in the U.S. for martial law to quote, take on American terrorists and for insurrection.
[3:48:27.160 --> 3:48:29.160]  This is a fact.
[3:48:29.160 --> 3:48:31.160]  So see, they deny it, deny it, deny it.
[3:48:31.160 --> 3:48:39.160]  But if you go to the training and you go read the FEMA press releases that I just put on screen, they say it's to take on American terrorists.
[3:48:39.160 --> 3:48:41.160]  Foreign troops.
[3:48:41.160 --> 3:48:56.160]  I've had Colonel Craig Roberts on whose nephew went through West Point and they had Wesley Clark and people in there giving them speeches saying, get ready to work with foreign troops to suppress American insurrection.
[3:48:56.160 --> 3:48:58.160]  They are going to use foreign troops.
[3:48:58.160 --> 3:49:01.160]  As crazy as that is, it's real, folks.
[3:49:01.160 --> 3:49:03.160]  This is really going on.
[3:49:03.160 --> 3:49:15.160]  I can show you the video out of the different television stations in Florida when they landed troops from more than 12 nations from Latin America to quote, take on American terrorists.
[3:49:15.160 --> 3:49:19.160]  In fact, Google Latin American troops land in Florida.
[3:49:19.160 --> 3:49:24.160]  We can show them the video right now during the break for people watching on prisonplanet.tv.
[3:49:24.160 --> 3:49:29.160]  I mean, it's just everywhere. It's wallowing in evidence.
[3:49:29.160 --> 3:49:32.160]  I have the army following and watching me.
[3:49:32.160 --> 3:49:34.160]  It's in mainstream news.
[3:49:34.160 --> 3:49:41.160]  They're doing it months after I tell you because the army leaks me a secret document because they don't like it.
[3:49:41.160 --> 3:49:48.160]  Folks, we're far down the rat hole when the army is following me around that they might be following me home today.
[3:49:48.160 --> 3:49:55.160]  I'll be like, oh, there they are behind me and I could take 10 turns and they're following me and they'll smile at me and laugh at me.
[3:49:55.160 --> 3:49:57.160]  It's all real funny. It's not funny.
[3:49:57.160 --> 3:49:59.160]  You guys are traitors.
[3:49:59.160 --> 3:50:05.160]  This isn't, you know, they've been over in Baghdad shooting people and torturing people and doing their crap.
[3:50:05.160 --> 3:50:07.160]  And now they're here.
[3:50:07.160 --> 3:50:11.160]  In fact, who's gave me an article earlier that I'm going to have some guests on.
[3:50:11.160 --> 3:50:14.160]  Lethal warriors bring combat hostility home.
[3:50:14.160 --> 3:50:17.160]  One unit were 10 of them committed murders.
[3:50:17.160 --> 3:50:21.160]  Units were three or four separately go out and rob banks.
[3:50:21.160 --> 3:50:22.160]  They're just going crazy.
[3:50:22.160 --> 3:50:27.160]  But see, most of them aren't going to have to rob banks because they're used to killing and stealing and breaking down doors.
[3:50:27.160 --> 3:50:30.160]  And this screws people up, folks, especially when you do two or three tours.
[3:50:30.160 --> 3:50:32.160]  It screws up about half the people that do one turn.
[3:50:32.160 --> 3:50:35.160]  Now they're all warped. They're all going to be cops.
[3:50:35.160 --> 3:50:40.160]  They got these kind of guys following me around, following Ron Paul around.
[3:50:40.160 --> 3:50:43.160]  Baltimore Sun reported on that.
[3:50:43.160 --> 3:50:45.160]  I mean, this is crazy, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:50:45.160 --> 3:50:49.160]  Now, a lot of the troops are good patriotic people and they know what's going on.
[3:50:49.160 --> 3:50:57.160]  But, uh, I mean, it is a total martial law grid and it is expanding its net right now and the enemy's building up.
[3:50:57.160 --> 3:50:59.160]  It looks like to move against us.
[3:50:59.160 --> 3:51:01.160]  So just get ready. Hold on.
[3:51:01.160 --> 3:51:08.160]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:51:08.160 --> 3:51:14.160]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[3:51:14.160 --> 3:51:20.160]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[3:51:20.160 --> 3:51:22.160]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[3:51:22.160 --> 3:51:25.160]  Yeah, fudged since day one in this election.
[3:51:25.160 --> 3:51:29.160]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[3:51:29.160 --> 3:51:38.160]  who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[3:51:38.160 --> 3:51:41.160]  It's not about left and right. It's about a one-world government.
[3:51:41.160 --> 3:51:48.160]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[3:51:48.160 --> 3:51:53.160]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com
[3:51:53.160 --> 3:51:56.160]  or download it in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:51:56.160 --> 3:52:00.160]  The Obama deception. The people strike back.
[3:52:03.160 --> 3:52:08.160]  If you owe the IRS, you can't make the problem go away without professional help.

[3:54:35.160 --> 3:54:37.160]  Who's up next?

[3:54:44.160 --> 3:54:48.160]  DeWayne and Jim and others we may not get to, but we'll see.
[3:54:48.160 --> 3:54:52.160]  I did want to just in closing thank this hour's sponsors.
[3:54:52.160 --> 3:54:54.160]  One of them is mysolarbackup.com.
[3:54:54.160 --> 3:54:56.160]  A lot of things can happen during these trouble times.
[3:54:56.160 --> 3:55:02.160]  Hurricanes, snow, ice storms, the control freak, globalists coming in with their carbon taxes.
[3:55:02.160 --> 3:55:04.160]  It's just good to start getting off the grid.
[3:55:04.160 --> 3:55:07.160]  A great little unit that will power quite a bit in your house.
[3:55:07.160 --> 3:55:09.160]  You get a bunch of the units around your whole house.
[3:55:09.160 --> 3:55:15.160]  Mysolarbackup.com, it consists of the power source, 1800 watt generator,
[3:55:15.160 --> 3:55:18.160]  and high efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity.
[3:55:18.160 --> 3:55:24.160]  It's mysolarbackup.com, it's mysolarbackup.com, or 877-327-0365.
[3:55:24.160 --> 3:55:27.160]  That's 877-327-0365.
[3:55:27.160 --> 3:55:33.160]  And in closing, a cola blue, the atmospheric water generator, what I use in my home,
[3:55:33.160 --> 3:55:36.160]  what we use in the office, they've got a new unit out.
[3:55:36.160 --> 3:55:39.160]  They're special, 20% off ends today.
[3:55:39.160 --> 3:55:45.160]  So I'd call today, 800-691-6043, 800-691-6043.
[3:55:45.160 --> 3:55:49.160]  It grabs the water out of the air and then sends it through seven different filters,
[3:55:49.160 --> 3:55:56.160]  including reverse osmosis and a carbon filter, a colablue.com, 800-691-6043.
[3:55:56.160 --> 3:56:02.160]  And one plug of the day, all my books and videos and materials at infowars.com
[3:56:02.160 --> 3:56:05.160]  and the online video bookstore that funds our operation, but that's secondary.
[3:56:05.160 --> 3:56:12.160]  Number one, these are great tools to wake people up and folks are ready to be woken up now.
[3:56:12.160 --> 3:56:13.160]  Let's take two final calls.
[3:56:13.160 --> 3:56:16.160]  Mike in Virginia, you're on the air.
[3:56:16.160 --> 3:56:18.160]  Hello, Alex.
[3:56:18.160 --> 3:56:19.160]  Hi, Mike.
[3:56:19.160 --> 3:56:20.160]  Hello, Alex.
[3:56:20.160 --> 3:56:26.160]  I'm calling because I found some images on the dollar bill that Jordan Maxwell
[3:56:26.160 --> 3:56:29.160]  or anybody hasn't found today that I know of.
[3:56:29.160 --> 3:56:32.160]  I'll try to make this quick because I know you're trying to take other calls.
[3:56:32.160 --> 3:56:37.160]  All right, what you need to do is get about five to $10, $1 bills.
[3:56:37.160 --> 3:56:43.160]  The area you're looking for is the white and black dots behind George Washington's head.
[3:56:43.160 --> 3:56:48.160]  You usually turn the dollar bill on its side or upside down, still looking at the front, of course.
[3:56:48.160 --> 3:56:53.160]  I found skulls, occult images, just all kinds of stuff.
[3:56:53.160 --> 3:56:56.160]  No, I don't think anybody's seen that.
[3:56:56.160 --> 3:57:00.160]  Well, there's all sorts of secret stuff on the dollar bill.
[3:57:00.160 --> 3:57:01.160]  I don't have a dollar bill.
[3:57:01.160 --> 3:57:08.160]  I have a 20 and a 10 and a 5, but it's just filled with occultic stuff, and they admit it is.
[3:57:08.160 --> 3:57:13.160]  So why don't you scan in that little image and just that little part of it and then point it out,
[3:57:13.160 --> 3:57:16.160]  write a blurb, and send it to writersandinfowars.com.
[3:57:16.160 --> 3:57:20.160]  We're getting a lot of listener-submitted ideas and stuff, and a lot of it's great.
[3:57:20.160 --> 3:57:22.160]  We're posting most of it.
[3:57:22.160 --> 3:57:27.160]  If not, post anything you want in the Prison Planet Forum unless it's calling for violence.
[3:57:27.160 --> 3:57:30.160]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in California.
[3:57:30.160 --> 3:57:32.160]  Mike, you're on the air.
[3:57:32.160 --> 3:57:33.160]  Hey, Alex. How are you doing?
[3:57:33.160 --> 3:57:34.160]  Good.
[3:57:34.160 --> 3:57:37.160]  First, I want to thank you for everything that you're doing.
[3:57:37.160 --> 3:57:43.160]  You actually made me feel sane again because for a long time, I had a lot of people saying,
[3:57:43.160 --> 3:57:46.160]  hey, you're crazy for all these things you're thinking.
[3:57:46.160 --> 3:57:47.160]  I'm 31 years old.
[3:57:47.160 --> 3:57:49.160]  I started doing this when I was 18 years old.
[3:57:49.160 --> 3:57:57.160]  I got into studying Babylon, and unlocking Babylon, it got me into the whole monarchy.
[3:57:57.160 --> 3:58:01.160]  I started seeing what the system was really about.
[3:58:01.160 --> 3:58:06.160]  I actually read a book by Alexander Hilflop called The Two Babylon.
[3:58:06.160 --> 3:58:14.160]  It woke me up to the whole being and actually seeing the whole system that our government is.
[3:58:14.160 --> 3:58:16.160]  It's almost a mirrored image of it.
[3:58:16.160 --> 3:58:17.160]  Hello?
[3:58:17.160 --> 3:58:24.160]  Well, these are Babylonian Mystery School systems of psychology and government and controlling populations.
[3:58:24.160 --> 3:58:29.160]  And if you know that science, then you have a monopoly over everything else and rule.
[3:58:29.160 --> 3:58:34.160]  But somehow they convinced the population not to even look into the sciences of control.
[3:58:34.160 --> 3:58:37.160]  It's our job to just get people to wake up and look around them.
[3:58:37.160 --> 3:58:38.160]  Thank you.
[3:58:38.160 --> 3:58:39.160]  Big show today.
[3:58:39.160 --> 3:58:41.160]  Retransmission starts now in FullWars.com.
[3:58:41.160 --> 3:58:43.160]  Great job, crew.

[3:58:51.160 --> 3:58:52.160]  This is Alex Jones.
[3:58:52.160 --> 3:58:54.160]  Have you heard of the millionaire patriot?
[3:58:54.160 --> 3:58:55.160]  Well, you should.
[3:58:55.160 --> 3:58:59.160]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.

[3:59:06.160 --> 3:59:10.160]  and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar.

[3:59:24.160 --> 3:59:30.160]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
