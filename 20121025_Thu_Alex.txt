[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:36.880]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:36.880 --> 00:42.800]  ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us on this Thursday the 25th day of
[00:42.800 --> 00:52.000]  October 2012 we have soldier X or I guess Captain X I could call him we have
[00:52.000 --> 00:57.720]  soldier X joining us coming up in about 30 minutes we have his military ID card
[00:57.720 --> 01:01.760]  we have his documents we checked into this Rob dude at the big interview
[01:01.760 --> 01:07.480]  yesterday on the nightly news in full-works nightly news National Guard
[01:07.480 --> 01:14.000]  whistleblower in Texas doomsday preppers will be targeted as terrorist and
[01:14.000 --> 01:18.400]  then Melissa Melton goes through in a big list of documents where this is
[01:18.400 --> 01:22.720]  actually backed up in mainstream media as well you know the government
[01:22.720 --> 01:26.720]  demonizes preppers constitutionalist gun owners libertarians conservatives and
[01:26.720 --> 01:32.400]  number one returning veterans because they know that returning veterans know
[01:32.400 --> 01:36.000]  the truth of what's going on and they've done actuary breakdowns knowing
[01:36.000 --> 01:40.680]  most of them are patriots you see it's just paradox of the troops are good on
[01:40.680 --> 01:44.000]  average the police are even good on average for my research but the
[01:44.000 --> 01:50.840]  leadership is corrupt so we're gonna be breaking that down today and Paul Watson
[01:50.840 --> 01:56.040]  sent me the raw video this morning he's he's done some clips of it with text
[01:56.040 --> 02:00.480]  we're gonna be playing and I know Ted Turner's a monster in fact I remember
[02:00.480 --> 02:04.960]  him on C-span back in the mid 90s saying that you know the general public are
[02:04.960 --> 02:11.360]  useless eaters useless eaters that's a Hitler quote he was re reissuing and he
[02:11.360 --> 02:15.400]  said we should reduce the world population by 90% and that was also picked
[02:15.400 --> 02:21.680]  up by autobond magazine as a quote from him so the point is he's a guy who has
[02:21.680 --> 02:25.520]  five kids the biggest landowner in the US dozens of aircraft I mean you know
[02:25.520 --> 02:30.720]  on record a giant consumer he says you should only have one kid he's got five
[02:30.720 --> 02:37.000]  five children so more power to you brother you don't criticize me for
[02:37.000 --> 02:42.720]  having three you punk you simpering globalist who guys will you print me the
[02:42.720 --> 02:47.680]  ABC News article a secret meeting of billionaires to discuss population was
[02:47.680 --> 02:51.760]  also in the Guardian ABC and Guardian have a similar headline but billionaires
[02:51.760 --> 02:55.480]  meeting secret to discuss population and they said yeah we're setting up our
[02:55.480 --> 03:00.760]  own little private global government you know to reduce your numbers and so
[03:00.760 --> 03:03.800]  many yuppies and people go good there are too many people at the grocery store
[03:03.800 --> 03:09.760]  on the hiking bike trail or yeah moron you're being targeted to you idiot stop
[03:09.760 --> 03:14.200]  playing like you're you know up there with the elites because you agree with
[03:14.200 --> 03:19.920]  this you're just agreeing to be smashed flattered and pancake yourself but it's
[03:19.920 --> 03:24.800]  this it's this fantasy they have I mean it's standard with trendy quote liberal
[03:24.800 --> 03:28.320]  yuppies that they're not really liberal trendies they are vicious no at all
[03:28.320 --> 03:33.440]  control freaks who want to reduce population so this is breaking here he
[03:33.440 --> 03:39.640]  said this several nights ago but two nights ago on Pierce Morgan and it's so
[03:39.640 --> 03:45.320]  mainstream now to say Ted Turner I think it's good US troops are killing
[03:45.320 --> 03:49.640]  themselves that's the bombshell Ted Turner I think it's good US troops are
[03:49.640 --> 03:58.240]  killing themselves that is so bombshell and he said it on a show with well
[03:58.240 --> 04:02.920]  Nielsen says a million ratings a million viewers but you know Nielsen
[04:02.920 --> 04:07.960]  they've been caught fudging stuff for MSNBC CNN and others but I mean still
[04:07.960 --> 04:13.200]  it's it's seen overseas by a lot but domestic audience of maybe 500,000 the
[04:13.200 --> 04:18.320]  best we can tell still and that's 500,000 people I'll guarantee you back when I was
[04:18.320 --> 04:23.240]  on one radio station 17 years ago and we probably had you know 40,000 listeners
[04:23.240 --> 04:27.800]  at any one time every 15 minutes hundreds of thousands listen to it off and
[04:27.800 --> 04:31.640]  on I had an audience a couple hundred thousand people it was it was rated number
[04:31.640 --> 04:35.880]  two at night in all of radio at one point that's even up against music my
[04:35.880 --> 04:41.240]  point is if I went on the air and said in front of 500,000 people back then that
[04:41.240 --> 04:45.400]  you know that I'm glad the troops are committing suicide folks I would be beat
[04:45.400 --> 04:52.120]  up by the time I got my car I would be fired within hours but he goes on singing
[04:52.120 --> 04:55.640]  in and says it and everybody agrees with him that's coming up it's good the
[04:55.640 --> 05:02.400]  troops are committing suicide the worst drought in 50 years continues and the
[05:02.400 --> 05:06.760]  first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record 78% of the
[05:06.760 --> 05:11.000]  Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions not only corn but soy alfalfa
[05:11.000 --> 05:15.000]  fruits vegetables and wheat are all impacted raising prices the cost to
[05:15.000 --> 05:18.600]  feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business blowing up your
[05:18.600 --> 05:22.920]  food prices the only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at
[05:22.920 --> 05:27.360]  today's prices by getting your own supply of foods for me foods direct now as the
[05:27.360 --> 05:31.120]  price of raw ingredients increases eat foods will have to raise prices to now
[05:31.120 --> 05:34.720]  is the time to get your supply I recently increased my supply for me foods
[05:34.720 --> 05:38.000]  direct because we've all known this was coming you know about their delicious
[05:38.000 --> 05:42.320]  long-term storable foods the fact is you can eat at any time to save money today
[05:42.320 --> 05:45.640]  and because it stores for 25 years you're locking in today's prices and

[06:08.440 --> 06:12.040]  healthy homecrafted sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut yogurt and
[06:12.040 --> 06:15.640]  kefir it seems there's a war on life giving foods with living enzymes and
[06:15.640 --> 06:19.160]  healthy bacteria but frankly I'm not sure what the food police are so afraid of
[06:19.160 --> 06:22.320]  these remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history with
[06:22.320 --> 06:25.520]  archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found across
[06:25.520 --> 06:29.840]  the globe in almost every culture even today Japanese eat miso Africans eat
[06:29.840 --> 06:34.320]  fermented porges Koreans eat kamichi and in India fermented milk is a staple for
[06:34.320 --> 06:37.680]  healthy living but here's some good news South for Lion Americans can now

[08:08.720 --> 08:11.560]  Alex Jones
[08:11.560 --> 08:28.840]  ladies and gentlemen Ted Turner two nights ago on CNN said he is quote glad
[08:28.840 --> 08:34.120]  and that it's good and began to say that it was a basically fantastic that US
[08:34.120 --> 08:42.920]  troops are committing suicide at the last time I checked something like 10
[08:42.920 --> 08:48.600]  times World War two levels it's an all-time record you can pull up the
[08:48.600 --> 08:54.520]  numbers yourself but it if you've seen the news it is just off the chart Ted
[08:54.520 --> 08:59.720]  Turner I think it's quote good US troops are killing themselves and he said he
[08:59.720 --> 09:03.840]  thinks the UN should have a world government a new world order and that
[09:03.840 --> 09:08.600]  we should be disarmed and that the UN should be the world policeman Watson
[09:08.600 --> 09:14.840]  sent me the full clip from CNN site and I sat there with my mouth hanging up and
[09:14.840 --> 09:20.040]  for 10 minutes watching the exchange and he's got links to that in his article
[09:20.040 --> 09:26.200]  up at info wars.com just tuned in I'm Alex Jones and I am anti-globalist
[09:26.200 --> 09:30.640]  anti-new world order because well I have the Wall Street Journal here in my
[09:30.640 --> 09:37.600]  hand billionaires try to shrink world's population report says and they got
[09:37.600 --> 09:41.760]  caught meeting in a secret meeting in fact guys it's this article in the
[09:41.760 --> 09:44.680]  Times of London right here that's the one I really want that link there in the
[09:44.680 --> 09:49.000]  article a billionaire club in bid to curb world population and they said we
[09:49.000 --> 09:53.880]  want a world government to forcibly reduce population by 90% and you know
[09:53.880 --> 09:59.120]  what I happen to know they're spraying aluminum to oxide on the West I happen to
[09:59.120 --> 10:03.720]  know they've been caught putting a sterilence in vaccines I happen to know
[10:03.720 --> 10:07.400]  that they write books bragging in fact you know what I keep forgetting well
[10:07.400 --> 10:10.560]  somebody running from the cameras it's okay and give me that eco science by
[10:10.560 --> 10:13.800]  John P. Holdren there in my stack I don't want to just keep saying hey it's in
[10:13.800 --> 10:18.280]  John P. Holdren's book you can just type in John P. Holdren put sterilence in
[10:18.280 --> 10:23.560]  water and you'll pull up the entire book scanned online and you'll pull up him
[10:23.560 --> 10:27.080]  saying stuff like that on c-span and admitting their chem trailing us they
[10:27.080 --> 10:30.920]  call it geoengineering you know I just tend to think it's a big deal when the
[10:30.920 --> 10:36.440]  you know world's ultra-rich have Hitler quotes like Ted Turner and back in the
[10:36.440 --> 10:40.800]  mid 90s on c-span again and it was quoted in Audubon magazine saying there's
[10:40.800 --> 10:45.200]  too many useless eaters in the world we need to reduce their numbers by 90% and
[10:45.200 --> 10:48.840]  he's quoted many other magazines publications saying similar things so
[10:48.840 --> 10:52.480]  was Prince Philip so was Prince Charles and then you see it's not just old
[10:52.480 --> 10:58.480]  eccentric saying that they're doing it and so see here's here's eco science and
[10:58.480 --> 11:04.120]  I have it all referenced out we did a two-hour interview last year with Tarpley
[11:04.120 --> 11:09.280]  and posted it at prisonplanet.tv where he went through the entire book with us
[11:09.280 --> 11:13.760]  dr. Tarpley who's an expert on eugenics and their whole world view so you want I
[11:13.760 --> 11:17.480]  think you might want to be a little concerned about this here it is Ted
[11:17.480 --> 11:23.000]  Turner I think it's good US troops are killing themselves singing and founder
[11:23.000 --> 11:26.760]  advocates UN taking role as global policemen so we're gonna get to that in
[11:26.760 --> 11:29.480]  a moment and then National Guard whistleblower and we've confirmed this
[11:29.480 --> 11:38.520]  doomsday preppers will be treated as terrorist and not only do we have his
[11:38.520 --> 11:42.840]  testimony and his ID card and we made some contacts confirmed he's in the
[11:42.840 --> 11:51.480]  National Guard currently I have a giant stack here of research yeah guys we
[11:51.480 --> 11:56.960]  probably don't want his documents and IDs and stuff in my document dump or you
[11:56.960 --> 12:00.640]  guys take this out of the studio just so it doesn't get caught on camera thank
[12:00.640 --> 12:07.680]  you somebody stuck his details inside my document pouch thank you anyways
[12:07.680 --> 12:11.520]  everything he says he's actually reverse engineered we're able to find it
[12:11.520 --> 12:15.600]  mainstream news in pieces so it's all confirmed they are training the military
[12:15.600 --> 12:19.400]  I've known this for a long time to come to your house and take all your food and
[12:19.400 --> 12:23.080]  guns and blow your head off you're just gonna be killed you're gonna be putting
[12:23.080 --> 12:29.080]  a ditch I video Marines training for this in police state 2000 where they
[12:29.080 --> 12:32.280]  interrogate people and say well you know what militia are you part of where'd
[12:32.280 --> 12:36.040]  you get your guns well I'm from San Francisco and then the Marine Corps
[12:36.040 --> 12:38.760]  Colonel runs in and says he's not supposed to be in here even though I've
[12:38.760 --> 12:43.440]  been invited to cover the drills in Oakland and then I just sent in people
[12:43.440 --> 12:47.360]  as local observers when they had separate media events they let the media in
[12:47.360 --> 12:51.160]  for one thing and then let the quote locals and so I just sent people in as
[12:51.160 --> 12:56.560]  locals and they got the Marines bringing out a militia member putting him on his
[12:56.560 --> 13:01.160]  knees this is in police state 2000 it's online it's free and shooting him and
[13:01.160 --> 13:07.440]  and the Marine says get ready to watch this execution I mean what do you think
[13:07.440 --> 13:11.600]  the Army and Marines do in Afghanistan that's even been on Fox News but they
[13:11.600 --> 13:18.160]  defended they go in villages and kill everybody remember that was first in the
[13:18.160 --> 13:21.920]  ethical journal they had a private gruckheimer is like seven years ago he
[13:21.920 --> 13:25.160]  goes yeah well you know we're really defeating the enemy we go in villages
[13:25.160 --> 13:28.680]  sometimes and kill everybody including the children and the Fox News had a
[13:28.680 --> 13:32.800]  general come on and say well that's only in certain extremist villages you know
[13:32.800 --> 13:36.160]  that's why they'll they'll bomb a wedding and kill 200 people to kill quote one
[13:36.160 --> 13:40.520]  bad guy well they don't just do that for them over there they're gonna do that
[13:40.520 --> 13:45.400]  here at least if they get the military to do it and who do they train them the
[13:45.400 --> 13:50.320]  number one enemy is they train them the number one enemy is the American people
[13:50.320 --> 13:54.280]  gun owners conservatives libertarians training veterans and now preppers and
[13:54.280 --> 13:58.160]  what happened in New Orleans they they wouldn't let people walk out on the
[13:58.160 --> 14:00.560]  highways that were high and dry they wouldn't let the fire departments and
[14:00.560 --> 14:07.280]  police departments are Walmart and and the the you know FEMA blocked everybody
[14:07.280 --> 14:10.960]  from coming in and helping including the Coast Guard who could get the power
[14:10.960 --> 14:14.680]  back on had big ships with giant generators they blocked them and for
[14:14.680 --> 14:17.720]  what six seven days I mean everybody go to the Superdome and then the police
[14:17.720 --> 14:21.680]  stood back with the National Guard and wouldn't give people food or water as it
[14:21.680 --> 14:26.200]  was stockpile let the rapes go on and giant flat bad trucks backed up with
[14:26.200 --> 14:29.560]  armored vehicles drove into the richest areas of New Orleans the surrounding
[14:29.560 --> 14:34.080]  areas went in blew safe doors off looted and robbed and took all the guns on
[14:34.080 --> 14:39.120]  video on video and people say man that was incredible they did that no no no
[14:39.120 --> 14:45.040]  they were ordered to and there it is New Orleans begins confiscating forums as
[14:45.040 --> 14:50.840]  water receipts what is that Associated Press oh New York Times there you go and
[14:50.840 --> 14:54.760]  remember the police chief said all the guns will be taken no one will be allowed
[14:54.760 --> 14:58.480]  to be armed but they didn't go into the crime-ridden areas and defend people
[14:58.480 --> 15:02.600]  being attacked no no they went into some of the wealthiest neighborhoods in the
[15:02.600 --> 15:06.560]  country or New Orleans your houses that look like the White House that same

[15:21.880 --> 15:27.200]  and they took their guns on the news and they have the Army officer I played it

[16:06.080 --> 16:11.520]  is truth what I'm saying this is the reality so here it is National Guard
[16:11.520 --> 16:25.200]  whistleblower doomsday preppers will be targeted as terrorist as terrorist and
[16:25.200 --> 16:28.920]  Melissa Melton then breaks down all the links that I have here where it's
[16:28.920 --> 16:32.840]  admitted in the news the other putting them on the fly list they're targeting
[16:32.840 --> 16:36.280]  they're putting them in databases I mean I've been to many public urban warfare
[16:36.280 --> 16:39.560]  drills where they always practice with guys in overalls with John Deere hats
[16:39.560 --> 16:45.040]  don't lose America don't take my form you can't take it or I'm not going with
[16:45.040 --> 16:49.920]  you to that camp and they attention attention attention you better go with
[16:49.920 --> 16:56.360]  us and then after that those that submit go to the FEMA camp they also have
[16:56.360 --> 16:58.800]  people they're begging to be in the FEMA camp to sell the troops that well
[16:58.800 --> 17:02.240]  this is something you want to be part of and then they roll in the armored
[17:02.240 --> 17:05.240]  vehicles and the rest of it for the militias that don't leave their houses
[17:05.240 --> 17:09.400]  and they just blow their houses up in the simulations I mean I've been to
[17:09.400 --> 17:13.900]  probably 15 of these I've had listeners send me video from countless other
[17:13.900 --> 17:19.880]  drills and it's always the same they've got what was in Hebron Maryland we got
[17:19.880 --> 17:23.160]  video that was many years ago but just a few years ago it's in police state for
[17:23.160 --> 17:29.120]  the rise of FEMA we have the Colonel on the show we got him on there in
[17:29.120 --> 17:34.520]  Arcadia Iowa and they had the gun shop play the part of the terror actually and
[17:34.520 --> 17:37.520]  they went confiscated that and they went door-to-door and it was in the
[17:37.520 --> 17:41.760]  newspaper how compliant everyone was for the gun confiscation drill and then
[17:41.760 --> 17:45.800]  they went door-to-door practicing taking the guns in America and they again had
[17:45.800 --> 17:50.200]  the Boy Scouts there we're going and reporting yeah my dad's got a gun and
[17:50.200 --> 17:55.760]  we have this on tape from Hebron Maryland Boy Scouts with the Marines
[17:55.760 --> 17:59.800]  coming in and saying what's in their house and helping report their parents
[17:59.800 --> 18:03.720]  such as you cannot make up the magnitude people said those can't be Boy Scouts
[18:03.720 --> 18:08.120]  that's impossible that must be fake and now we have the New York Times from what
[18:08.120 --> 18:12.240]  three four years ago how the Explorer Scouts are training to do door-to-door
[18:12.240 --> 18:17.640]  and quote take out the scrum old Iraqi war veterans headline New York Times
[18:17.640 --> 18:23.600]  Scouts train to fight terrorist and more people laughed and said oh yeah 14-year-olds
[18:23.600 --> 18:28.880]  bringing on those 14-year-olds are 18 now anybody who knows the history of
[18:28.880 --> 18:32.520]  warfare knows actually 14-year-olds are about the best it gets because they're
[18:32.520 --> 18:36.240]  not afraid to die for whatever reason they get excited they're designed for
[18:36.240 --> 18:40.200]  war humans are designed for combat ladies and gentlemen decide to defend our
[18:40.200 --> 18:44.240]  tribes they're designed at 13 14 to want to go with the older warriors and
[18:44.240 --> 18:49.520]  fight that's how it works they arrest our development falsely and the point is
[18:49.520 --> 18:52.080]  they've got them they've got them ready and they've been training since their
[18:52.080 --> 18:56.440]  13 14 to come to your house and take your guns people go how dare you attack
[18:56.440 --> 19:01.160]  the Boy Scouts I'm not attacking the Boy Scouts I'm saying this is a fact the
[19:01.160 --> 19:04.720]  Boy Scouts trained to take your guns the Boy Scouts trained to take your guns
[19:04.720 --> 19:08.640]  we say that again the Boy Scouts trained to take your guns I've got video I've
[19:08.640 --> 19:13.240]  got kernels I've got news articles I got photos of the New York Times I got it
[19:13.240 --> 19:18.440]  in triplicate people thought I was a space alien in 1998 when we got that
[19:18.440 --> 19:23.000]  Hebron Maryland footage that our listeners went and shot and they
[19:23.000 --> 19:26.680]  sent me hours and hours of we ought to put all that stuff online I just used
[19:26.680 --> 19:31.680]  like 15 minutes of it police say 2000 just the highlights of it I mean it's
[19:31.680 --> 19:35.640]  got Marines walking over with machine guns saying turn your cameras off you're
[19:35.640 --> 19:39.520]  not allowed to film the police come and grab their stuff but still thought it
[19:39.520 --> 19:42.840]  might be America and gave them the footage back so we got it we're talking
[19:42.840 --> 19:47.760]  about Marines with heavy machine guns walking up saying you're gonna turn your
[19:47.760 --> 19:51.480]  cameras off well no kidding you don't want us to see plain clothes Marines and
[19:51.480 --> 19:56.520]  Marines in uniform training with the local scout troop how to turn mommy and
[19:56.520 --> 20:03.200]  daddy in I mean if this isn't reason I don't know what is that's what it sounds
[20:03.200 --> 20:06.840]  like when a burglar kicks in the door of a dark house that looks like no one is
[20:06.840 --> 20:10.840]  home don't let your home be the next target make it look like someone is
[20:10.840 --> 20:15.240]  home watching television with fake TV fake TV is a small electronic device
[20:15.240 --> 20:19.120]  that makes the same light as a real television so from outside it looks like
[20:19.120 --> 20:23.480]  someone is home watching TV fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer but
[20:23.480 --> 20:28.240]  is far more convincing to burglars fake TV deters burglars cost far less than an
[20:28.240 --> 20:32.040]  alarm and is highly recommended by numerous police departments use it
[20:32.040 --> 20:37.440]  anytime you're away from home to order your fake TV for only 3495 go to fake

[25:05.160 --> 25:08.920]  and I used to listen to you when I was 15 my dad and thought you were lying and I
[25:08.920 --> 25:11.600]  joined the army or Marines and we went out and did drills and guess what they
[25:11.600 --> 25:15.040]  were wearing they were dressed like farmers we're training to it's true my
[25:15.040 --> 25:19.320]  gosh it's all true yeah you bet it's true we think I'm lying up here and I'm
[25:19.320 --> 25:24.320]  lying I'm dying I don't believe in lying folks I believe in telling the truth
[25:24.320 --> 25:29.080]  and people are scared of the truth by the way you want to hear some truth we're
[25:29.080 --> 25:33.200]  gonna get more into this attempted takeover but it's outrageous they won't
[25:33.200 --> 25:37.160]  get away with it if we just recognize it but historically really bad things have
[25:37.160 --> 25:42.560]  a way of happening because people can't believe it's happening you've got to
[25:42.560 --> 25:45.920]  admit this is going on and get freaked out about it people say what do you want
[25:45.920 --> 25:51.040]  us to be afraid no I inherently think you're like I am I started finding out
[25:51.040 --> 25:54.720]  about this stuff 17 years ago I didn't know one-tenth of what I know then and I
[25:54.720 --> 25:58.320]  knew I better get involved people want to enslave me people want to take my guns
[25:58.320 --> 26:01.280]  people want to get rid of the private property they want to get rid of the
[26:01.280 --> 26:05.160]  family they want to sit there and lecture me in an authoritarian way that
[26:05.160 --> 26:09.600]  I've got to stand down and give up my rights and I'm bad no I'm gonna stand up
[26:09.600 --> 26:15.160]  against you how's that sound it's a basic instinct for freedom and you've all
[26:15.160 --> 26:19.200]  got it you've got to rediscover it and if you don't feel an absolute burning
[26:19.200 --> 26:28.240]  desire to resist evil something's wrong with you bondage is not funny it's not
[26:28.240 --> 26:32.640]  cute and I will not let my three children live in bondage I will resist the
[26:32.640 --> 26:36.440]  new world order I'm gonna die trying before people just sit around in their
[26:36.440 --> 26:40.560]  house loading guns up and saying well someday they'll come engage in the infill
[26:40.560 --> 26:47.920]  war now and the tyranny will never get fully matured but it may they're trying
[26:47.920 --> 26:51.480]  to accelerate its maturing process right now because they can look at our
[26:51.480 --> 26:55.720]  trajectory and they know we're gonna beat them so the enemy's dangerous they're
[26:55.720 --> 27:00.720]  a cornered rat in control the financial system in control of most the states
[27:00.720 --> 27:03.760]  they're trying to bring us into world government trying to hide it in plain
[27:03.760 --> 27:09.880]  view after decades of denying it existed we've got the initiative right now and
[27:09.880 --> 27:13.840]  we've got the proof and the facts and we have simply got a point out that we've
[27:13.840 --> 27:19.040]  been right now let me go to this tape here this is from CNN it's up an info
[27:19.040 --> 27:22.120]  wars.com this should be one of the biggest stories in the country but it's
[27:22.120 --> 27:26.920]  been out for two days no one covered it he said this on Pierce Morgan two nights
[27:26.920 --> 27:33.400]  ago in front of everyone and no one has picked this up Ted Turner I think it's
[27:33.400 --> 27:38.200]  good US troops are killing themselves CNN founder advocates UN take a role as
[27:38.200 --> 27:43.160]  global policemen here are a few of the clips with Paul Watson put text comments
[27:43.160 --> 27:47.800]  in between here it is Ted Turner told CNN he thinks it's good at US troops are
[27:47.800 --> 27:54.600]  telling themselves more American servicemen are dying suicide if I'm
[27:54.600 --> 27:58.760]  suicide over there then are dying in combat I mean that's shocking isn't it
[27:58.760 --> 28:05.080]  well what it what it no I think it's true I think it's good because it's so
[28:05.080 --> 28:11.280]  clear that we're programmed and and and we're born to love and help each other
[28:11.280 --> 28:15.880]  not to kill each other destroy each other that's an aberration that's all left
[28:15.880 --> 28:20.760]  all of them all from hundreds of years ago it's time for us to start acting
[28:20.760 --> 28:29.320]  all enlightened was he about to say I think it's terrific he bet he was here
[28:29.320 --> 28:35.120]  is talking isn't it well what it what it no I think it's true I think it's good
[28:35.120 --> 28:38.480]  after saying it's good that US troops are killing themselves Turner then
[28:38.480 --> 28:46.840]  advocates their role you start by the UN incredible incredible tell me what you
[28:46.840 --> 28:52.240]  think America's place in the new world order should be seen as the global
[28:52.240 --> 28:56.400]  policeman but as you said before you know it's hard to see with all these
[28:56.400 --> 28:59.880]  military conflicts where the winner and loser lies what what should America be
[28:59.880 --> 29:05.160]  doing I think all the policemen should be the United Nations there you go UN
[29:05.160 --> 29:09.800]  soldiers commit suicide at a rate of almost one per day US soldiers do is
[29:09.800 --> 29:13.640]  this really a good thing well you know he says it is Ted Turner you heard him
[29:13.640 --> 29:20.680]  right here no I think it's I think it's good oh there you go he he thinks it's
[29:20.680 --> 29:26.560]  he thinks it's good Ted Turner ladies and gentlemen we're gonna play that more
[29:26.560 --> 29:33.440]  and the full on X unexcerpted clip is also in our article Ted Turner I think
[29:33.440 --> 29:38.080]  it's good US troops are killing themselves CNN founder advocates UN take
[29:38.080 --> 29:43.620]  role as global policemen in a new world order but the ADL and Southern
[29:43.620 --> 29:47.000]  Harvey Law Center say I'm an extremist and evil none of this is happening

[31:04.040 --> 31:08.520]  farmers Americans are losing access not just a raw milk and homemade cheeses but
[31:08.520 --> 31:12.040]  to healthy home crafted sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut yogurt
[31:12.040 --> 31:15.600]  and kefir it seems there's a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes
[31:15.600 --> 31:19.200]  and healthy bacteria but frankly I'm not sure what the food police are so afraid
[31:19.200 --> 31:22.240]  of these remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history
[31:22.240 --> 31:25.280]  with archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found
[31:25.280 --> 31:29.240]  across the globe in almost every culture even today Japanese eat me so
[31:29.240 --> 31:33.640]  Africans eat fermented porges Koreans eat kamichi and in India fermented milk
[31:33.640 --> 31:37.000]  is a staple for healthy living but here's some good news self-reliant
[31:37.000 --> 31:40.400]  Americans can now discover the secrets to making these amazing fermented foods

[33:32.560 --> 33:35.960]  they are taught and I have video of it sent to me from Kansas City by a
[33:35.960 --> 33:39.800]  firefighter and a police firefighter conference with FEMA saying the founding
[33:39.800 --> 33:44.000]  fathers were bad we have that in their official myack and homeland security
[33:44.000 --> 33:47.600]  training manuals of course and it's been national news now for about three and a
[33:47.600 --> 33:51.480]  half years that they trained to take on quote veterans and a homeland security
[33:51.480 --> 33:54.840]  said you bet veterans of the number one terrorist they're the number one enemy
[33:54.840 --> 33:58.520]  and that's just the way it is and people will soon say it's patriotic to see
[33:58.520 --> 34:02.840]  their veteran neighbor hold away to a reeducation center and reeducation
[34:02.840 --> 34:07.080]  centers are in the new official army manual now the army responded us five
[34:07.080 --> 34:09.760]  months ago and said yes that's a real document you're not supposed to have it
[34:09.760 --> 34:14.480]  they even use the term reeducation camp that Mao Zedong used so they could use
[34:14.480 --> 34:18.240]  different names they want this all out in the open we're going to take your guns
[34:18.240 --> 34:23.600]  we're training you can forces against you youth course in fact they just ran
[34:23.600 --> 34:29.240]  in here with a mainstream article about homeland security is running around
[34:29.240 --> 34:32.720]  recruiting here it is the hill homeland security to recruit from u.s.
[34:32.720 --> 34:36.920]  universities just like the CIA is and operating domestically we need to figure
[34:36.920 --> 34:40.880]  out how to get them into DHS effectively and keep them and Poletano told the
[34:40.880 --> 34:44.880]  group yeah they're converting over the paramilitary dependence that are now
[34:44.880 --> 34:48.720]  going to run our lives in the collapsing economy and if you think it's going to go
[34:48.720 --> 34:52.200]  away when Mitt Romney gets elected go ahead and hold your breath see how long
[34:52.200 --> 34:56.480]  that works for you not that I wish you know that things wouldn't just get
[34:56.480 --> 35:00.840]  better with the president this is a globalist agenda that's why Romney and
[35:00.840 --> 35:04.840]  Obama are so close together on the real issues the rhetoric's a little different
[35:04.840 --> 35:09.760]  but when their actions man they are they are two birds of a feather that
[35:09.760 --> 35:17.520]  certainly fly together so we're going to be going over all of that again Ted
[35:17.520 --> 35:20.720]  Turner I think it's good US troops are killing themselves and it's it's been
[35:20.720 --> 35:26.960]  out in the news for two days on CNN no news report no news report and a listener
[35:26.960 --> 35:31.240]  sent this to Paul Watson early this morning we went looked it up there it
[35:31.240 --> 35:35.040]  is on their website they've got it posted about Ted Turner you know talks
[35:35.040 --> 35:39.600]  about the New World Order how great it is but it doesn't exist we're gonna go
[35:39.600 --> 35:47.720]  to our guest here in just a moment we'll just call him soldier X but we've got
[35:47.720 --> 35:51.840]  all his documents he's currently in the National Guard but National Guard
[35:51.840 --> 35:55.640]  whistleblower doomsday preppers will be treated as terrorists big breaking news
[35:55.640 --> 36:01.280]  also at prisonplanet.com info wars.net and info wars.com a big news this
[36:01.280 --> 36:04.600]  seems to get out to everybody because if they can just quietly demonize
[36:04.600 --> 36:10.000]  veterans gun owners libertarians conservatives preppers then the cops in
[36:10.000 --> 36:13.760]  the military will start buying into it we've got a publicly it's always a battle
[36:13.760 --> 36:18.280]  pushing back and forth it's continual you give up they win we're starting to get
[36:18.280 --> 36:21.920]  the initiative that's why they're getting desperate and fighting back so
[36:21.920 --> 36:26.040]  we're in this fight in fact you know we're like in round six here of a 12
[36:26.040 --> 36:29.840]  round bout we're toe-to-toe we've got the initiative but they're coming out
[36:29.840 --> 36:34.240]  swinging and they could stage false flags they can do anything but we've got
[36:34.240 --> 36:38.840]  to just put the full energy in to exposing these people and that means
[36:38.840 --> 36:44.360]  demonizing them with their actions that means using the truth the ultimate
[36:44.360 --> 36:48.760]  tool of against tyranny they've got black propaganda that means lies all
[36:48.760 --> 36:52.000]  information warfare is called propaganda it doesn't even have a negative
[36:52.000 --> 36:56.280]  connotation of the true semantical breakdown when I say you know that hey
[36:56.280 --> 36:59.840]  it's good to get exercise and eat organic food that's that's health
[36:59.840 --> 37:03.880]  propaganda it's true it's healthy what I said it comes from my heart and
[37:03.880 --> 37:09.400]  research because telling the truth feels so good standing up to evil feels so
[37:09.400 --> 37:13.080]  good people say oh thank you tell the truth are you kidding I'll die for the
[37:13.080 --> 37:18.680]  truth that's the thing about people that serve evil once you get some petty
[37:18.680 --> 37:23.440]  power I guess I'm just not like them and listen those of you out there that do
[37:23.440 --> 37:28.600]  love good and have it in your heart it's time to fight it's time to put that
[37:28.600 --> 37:31.640]  into action it's time to expose these people it's time to get aggressive
[37:31.640 --> 37:37.920]  getting us on AM and FM stations getting the magazine in bulk or giving them as a
[37:37.920 --> 37:42.080]  gift subscription great way to wake people up imagine 13 issues delivered to

[37:46.080 --> 37:51.080]  and info to get them to go in and look at the inside all the factoids but you
[37:51.080 --> 37:55.400]  yourself need to get an access show or or get a local radio show or put out a
[37:55.400 --> 38:00.280]  local newsletter or you just get a good or do banner hangs get aggressive get
[38:00.280 --> 38:04.520]  the buzz of liberty going they want to shut us down with intimidation now yeah

[38:21.280 --> 38:24.880]  be able to execute that it's a bluff they may be able to attack certain people
[38:24.880 --> 38:29.200]  that are predisposed to be demonized to try to scare everyone else to roll over
[38:29.200 --> 38:32.920]  they thought it's been declassified it came out in Congress they'd attack some
[38:32.920 --> 38:37.040]  kind of weird cultish people you know that's how the media pushed it some of
[38:37.040 --> 38:41.080]  it was weird I know them but a lot of it was lies the branch devideans they'd
[38:41.080 --> 38:44.560]  burn them down and kill them and set the precedent that was one of the biggest
[38:44.560 --> 38:50.560]  awakenings ever so they don't have air superiority either in the media they
[38:50.560 --> 38:55.520]  could shut down the web now we've already hit them so hard so savagely we've
[38:55.520 --> 38:59.760]  already basically in one and I fight we've already stabbed about 14 times they
[38:59.760 --> 39:03.280]  got a lot of adrenaline they're still going all we got to do stay back they
[39:03.280 --> 39:08.320]  haven't even hit us you understand that we've already stabbed them a bomb and
[39:08.320 --> 39:11.200]  they're bleeding out folks that's but that's they're dangerous right now they
[39:11.200 --> 39:15.320]  got that last push of adrenaline we can beat these authoritarian scum if we
[39:15.320 --> 39:20.000]  absolutely get in their face and absolutely with love for our families
[39:20.000 --> 39:24.520]  convert that right into stomping down the New World Order you can call it hate
[39:24.520 --> 39:27.560]  if you want but it's not it's something different it's it's it's focused
[39:27.560 --> 39:32.200]  rage and passion against evil because you love your families and you can just
[39:32.200 --> 39:37.360]  literally literally crush these people we have the moral authority we have God
[39:37.360 --> 39:40.280]  on our side and you've got to step into that and take it in your hands now I

[42:53.760 --> 42:57.920]  civil unrest in this morning they're taking places they're going to use

[43:28.400 --> 43:32.480]  supposed to march off against them your phone connection isn't as good as it was
[43:32.480 --> 43:35.520]  last night try to talk right on your phone for us sir we appreciate your
[43:35.520 --> 43:40.440]  courage coming on here specifically though tell us about the briefing what
[43:40.440 --> 43:46.240]  they said to you I'm gonna give us every little tidbit
[43:47.600 --> 43:57.400]  I know that the following is referring to we've been told that the civil unrest is
[43:57.400 --> 44:03.920]  bad enough that they're basically going to take over everything from gas stations
[44:03.920 --> 44:10.680]  to grocery stores to God knows what and as far as the parking goes I've seen where
[44:10.680 --> 44:19.840]  they're saying and I've seen it myself receiving an appointment to set up makeshift filling stations
[44:19.840 --> 44:30.640]  makeshift filling stations yes sir are you on a hands-free
[44:30.640 --> 44:38.640]  I'm gonna have to I'm gonna I'm gonna have to we have a pre-show deal where we
[44:38.640 --> 44:45.040]  check a phone line for we put some money on air are you on a hands-free I can
[44:45.040 --> 44:50.080]  barely hear you Alex are you on a hands-free
[44:50.720 --> 44:55.760]  say that again during that stop the interview thank you let's work with him
[44:55.760 --> 45:01.760]  on his headset pre-show deal let's work with him on that he's probably got a
[45:01.760 --> 45:06.200]  wire I can tell from the noises over the years and there's wind out there he
[45:06.200 --> 45:12.880]  needs to go to the actual handset okay standard deal alright again the full
[45:12.880 --> 45:15.400]  interview will probably just end up airing the one he did would do very
[45:15.400 --> 45:22.960]  powerful and it ties in with New Orleans was a drill for this make everybody go
[45:22.960 --> 45:26.560]  to the sport stone then go to the rich areas high and dry and loot everything
[45:26.560 --> 45:30.120]  and send people to the sport stone I mean that's what they've been training for
[45:30.120 --> 45:34.320]  is coordinating cities locking things down I want to get Stuart Rhodes on the
[45:34.320 --> 45:41.480]  nightly news tonight with me we can do that or even later in the broadcast again
[45:41.480 --> 45:45.840]  last night he was off duty so he's able to be on a clear line he's just ducking
[45:45.840 --> 45:51.800]  out obviously nervous outside his post talking to us right now here in Texas and
[45:51.800 --> 45:55.160]  we appreciate his courage coming on the broadcast but obviously you can't put
[45:55.160 --> 46:02.040]  audio like that on air it's an audio format okay again I think what we'll
[46:02.040 --> 46:06.160]  probably do is when we start the next hour because it's so important I'm gonna
[46:06.160 --> 46:12.720]  air excerpts of the Rob do interview it's so important to get this interview
[46:12.720 --> 46:20.080]  out to everyone National Guard whistleblower doomsday preppers will be
[46:20.080 --> 46:26.600]  treated as terrorist and the Melissa Melton's article starts I do solemnly
[46:26.600 --> 46:29.240]  swear that I will support defend the Constitution the United States against
[46:29.240 --> 46:32.280]  all enemies foreign and domestic and the Miller rights and Constitution and
[46:32.280 --> 46:36.640]  Declaration of Independence clearly states everything we're publicly seeing
[46:36.640 --> 46:41.440]  from the TSA to highway checkpoints the NSA warrant was spying to drones it's all
[46:41.440 --> 46:45.600]  totally illegal and we have a lawless government run by foreign banks in fact
[46:45.600 --> 46:48.480]  guys we just played Ted Turner saying he's glad the troops are killing
[46:48.480 --> 46:52.400]  themselves on CNN people seem to be so broke back they think that's okay out
[46:52.400 --> 46:57.960]  there two days national TV not even an issue can you queue up these CNBC thing
[46:57.960 --> 47:00.960]  where they said foreign banks have conquered us in a world government and
[47:00.960 --> 47:04.400]  run us that clips important I think new listeners have a lot of new affiliates
[47:04.400 --> 47:09.760]  out there a lot of new stations out there need to be aware of this that
[47:09.760 --> 47:14.080]  that there's people that have taken over our government bigger than Obama who
[47:14.080 --> 47:19.280]  hate the Republic and are reengineering America in a Soviet style breakdown
[47:19.280 --> 47:26.400]  takeover so here is that clip from CNBC where they tell you you are slaves
[47:26.400 --> 47:31.640]  foreign banks world government but it doesn't exist the ADL says here it is
[47:31.640 --> 47:37.280]  actually what they do is hold summits I think that right now the question is do
[47:37.280 --> 47:41.000]  we all work for central bankers that's what I want to address to our guests
[47:41.000 --> 47:46.120]  tonight is this global governance at last is it one world the central bankers
[47:46.120 --> 47:51.080]  in charge Jim Jim Yorio you say we've got some downside here a correction in the
[47:51.080 --> 47:55.360]  markets fine but aren't we all just living and dying for what the central
[47:55.360 --> 47:59.320]  banks do aren't we all just counting on the fact that there's a Bernanke put
[47:59.320 --> 48:05.200]  put and that we won't go any lower than say 5% down from here of course we are
[48:05.200 --> 48:08.520]  because if we look at the economic data there's nothing to get excited about in
[48:08.520 --> 48:13.160]  that so we you know yesterday we saw some reluctance for the Bernanke Fed to
[48:13.160 --> 48:16.280]  expand their balance sheets and pump more money in but the stock market knows
[48:16.280 --> 48:20.360]  that reluctance is totally different than not willing to do it at all and
[48:20.360 --> 48:25.200]  that's why we saw oil and oil implode and gold trade off heavily because they're
[48:25.200 --> 48:29.000]  not a protected class if the stock market starts trading off in the 10 to 15 to
[48:29.000 --> 48:32.360]  20 percent area the chairman's gonna come in and throw some stimulus at it so to
[48:32.360 --> 48:36.360]  answer your question we are absolutely slaves to central banks because we'd
[48:36.360 --> 48:39.240]  love to be slaves of the economy but the economic numbers continue to do
[48:39.240 --> 48:43.000]  nothing okay so look and it goes on with the other guests saying now we're
[48:43.000 --> 48:47.120]  slaves to foreign banks here's Curt Nemo's article European Union has put
[48:47.120 --> 48:52.640]  out new posters all over the 15 member states with a giant star with you
[48:52.640 --> 48:58.720]  guessed it a hammer and sickle on it and this is putting put up all over Europe
[48:58.720 --> 49:04.240]  by the European Union government unelected and it has the hammer and
[49:04.240 --> 49:10.720]  sickle on it see it's time for everything to be in your face now you
[49:10.720 --> 49:13.720]  understand it's time for everything to be in your face because they're about to
[49:13.720 --> 49:21.280]  go live on us they're about to go hot on us and the hammer and sickle has under
[49:21.280 --> 49:26.480]  the Soviets and under the communist other areas like China has conservatively in
[49:26.480 --> 49:31.960]  the last hundred years since 1917 so in the last you know 90 something years
[49:31.960 --> 49:47.240]  killed 170 plus million people Hitler all casualties combined 20 million over 150
[49:47.240 --> 49:54.920]  some estimates are 170 they vary 150 160 170 whatever 100 because they they
[49:54.920 --> 49:57.920]  argue about how many male kill was it 60 something million or 80 something million
[49:57.920 --> 50:01.480]  the CIA says 60 something million they help put him in at 49 the Chinese
[50:01.480 --> 50:06.160]  government today says apologizes as 60 I mean says 80 something million I mean
[50:06.160 --> 50:11.360]  let me talk about these numbers okay they will do this here you you've heard
[50:11.360 --> 50:16.960]  the FBI people that infiltrated the weathermen here where they said yeah
[50:16.960 --> 50:19.480]  they said once they take over and collapse things they're gonna put 50
[50:19.480 --> 50:25.360]  million in reeducation camps and kill half and that's the plan is to tell the
[50:25.360 --> 50:28.960]  military during a collapse okay here's a list of people that are terrorists and

[54:13.360 --> 54:17.400]  watching you I know the globalists are upset that our founders fought the
[54:17.400 --> 54:22.120]  Second Amendment as an emergency backup against takeovers by infiltrators just
[54:22.120 --> 54:26.480]  like this the number one thing they were worried about I know that you're mad
[54:26.480 --> 54:30.440]  that a lot of us still know how to skin a buck and trot run a trot line you're
[54:30.440 --> 54:33.320]  very upset that we know how to use firearms and then we won't go to your
[54:33.320 --> 54:38.360]  FEMA camps and I know you hate the troops simultaneously you need to use
[54:38.360 --> 54:41.920]  the troops against the American people so you try to tell the troops the
[54:41.920 --> 54:46.000]  veterans of the enemy I mean folks just look at the people running the
[54:46.000 --> 54:49.640]  government say George Washington's bad now our he was able to get a clear line
[54:49.640 --> 54:54.560]  he's got about 15 minutes with us let's go back to soldier X recap you've got
[54:54.560 --> 54:58.160]  the floor this is a short segment when this happened what you were told not
[54:58.160 --> 55:02.240]  exactly where they'll figure out where you're at here in Texas and then what
[55:02.240 --> 55:07.360]  they told you and what the response was go ahead okay it was about two weeks
[55:07.360 --> 55:13.520]  ago we had a briefing and they told us that they were preparing for
[55:13.520 --> 55:19.040]  civil unrest before during and after the election and that during the civil
[55:19.040 --> 55:22.400]  unrest it's a natural guard would be used to go out and call them the civil
[55:22.400 --> 55:26.720]  unrest the problem with that is that they were saying that our top contenders
[55:26.720 --> 55:30.480]  as enemies would be the doomsday purpose and that they would be treated as
[55:30.480 --> 55:35.680]  terrorists and that we were to take them as terrorists they told us that any
[55:35.680 --> 55:41.720]  soldiers that the doomsday purpose would also be treated as effects and that
[55:41.720 --> 55:44.800]  they would be handled accordingly I don't know what they meant by handled
[55:44.800 --> 55:48.920]  accordingly but that's the words they used there's a lot of stuff going on
[55:48.920 --> 55:57.120]  right now we're hearing a lot of stuff about how and I learned this from one
[55:57.120 --> 56:02.680]  of my NCOs that they need the National Guard troops to go take them away from
[56:02.680 --> 56:09.080]  regular American people and any of us who decide not to be that will be handled
[56:09.080 --> 56:15.960]  accordingly well I grew up in Texas and all that good stuff and I grew up with
[56:15.960 --> 56:20.760]  guns and I don't you know my dad taught me all about second amendment my dad's
[56:20.760 --> 56:30.040]  been listening to you Alex since before Y2K and so basically I mean I've been
[56:30.040 --> 56:34.920]  raised on the second amendment and the belief in it and I see through all the
[56:34.920 --> 56:40.200]  holes that you know sure just to be clear your your your NCO is telling you
[56:40.200 --> 56:43.880]  you're preparing for gun confiscation and I guess he thinks that's going to be a
[56:43.880 --> 56:48.200]  fun mission and that I mean this is open treason saying Americans that are
[56:48.200 --> 56:52.280]  getting prepared for the collapse that we're terrorists I mean that's a total
[56:52.280 --> 56:58.000]  act of treason sedition against the Republic that is a military insurrection
[56:58.000 --> 57:05.400]  for a foreign power is totally illegal I mean did your NCO non-commissioned
[57:05.400 --> 57:19.680]  officers seem excited about this no the group of us that have said that we will not be part of the taking of the guns and be part of the calming of the civil unrest
[57:19.680 --> 57:25.120]  basically we haven't like been open about it in front of our commanders and stuff
[57:25.120 --> 57:31.160]  because we don't want anything to happen to us yeah no I think the time is for
[57:31.160 --> 57:34.480]  everybody to start going public and doing YouTube videos and go to the media
[57:34.480 --> 57:38.840]  and they can't get everybody and we'll stop this attempted coup d'etat that
[57:38.840 --> 57:42.120]  they're trying to complete against our country do you understand sir that's not
[57:42.120 --> 57:46.040]  rhetoric what you're being told is high treason and totally illegal by these
[57:46.040 --> 57:51.760]  people yes sir and I do understand that and mine and my buddies plans were that
[57:51.760 --> 57:58.520]  when they should hit the fan for us to go where we can sit on the pound and wait
[57:58.520 --> 58:04.440]  for the right time to be able to take back America well the right time is now
[58:04.440 --> 58:09.640]  in the info war sir and you're doing that on air I commend you but I mean look
[58:09.640 --> 58:13.400]  we got the Army manuals admitting gun confiscation drills they're all linked
[58:13.400 --> 58:16.680]  in the article by Melissa Melton the all of it I mean it's time for talk show
[58:16.680 --> 58:20.800]  host it's time for everybody realize we've got a criminal rotten government
[58:20.800 --> 58:24.000]  and if we don't stand up to these crooks now they're gonna drop the hammer and
[58:24.000 --> 58:29.720]  try to totally take over and people if you think caloring to these scum is
[58:29.720 --> 58:34.560]  going to protect us you think again the only way to beat these people is to get

[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:22.840]  telling you that's on the front burner now they've got all these fake anonymous
[01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:25.960]  groups calling for storming the White House the day before the election and
[01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:31.320]  for bombing things and remember all the Obama's top advisers saying he needs a
[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:35.640]  terror attack to blame it on his enemies remember that
[01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:42.960]  do you remember that that's soldier X yes I remember that now we link to all

[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:05.080]  have you there's been prepping for that they've been receiving pieces of
[01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:09.880]  equipment to fit together makeshift fuel points basically they'll be able to set
[01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:14.000]  these fuel bags up anywhere they want and set up a fuel point shut off any gas
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:17.440]  stations and if you want to you're gonna have to go to them to get it which
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:20.760]  means you're gonna have to turn yourself over or give up your guns or whatever
[01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:25.040]  they want for you in order for you to get fuel the things you need to survive
[01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:30.080]  that's right it's a it's a drawing and coordinating and blockading exactly what
[01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:33.720]  Stuart Rhodes has gotten intel on and the military is openly training for this
[01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:38.280]  and that's how they always get your guns and that's how the Soviets do it is they
[01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:42.760]  lock everybody down that's why the TSA Rob do just flew out to see his wife
[01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:47.680]  who's working out of town he said TSA was all past the checkpoint searching
[01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:52.160]  people and running IDs and that's what it is you're just oh okay you try to come
[01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:55.960]  in the grocery store they got troops there they'll have TSA style goons there
[01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:59.760]  who the political officers they run your license hope come with us we need to

[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:07.520]  they loads you on a truck to go to actual killers and then they're gonna get
[01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:11.160]  off on it I mean they're really the scum like this just just you can see them
[01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:14.600]  get creamy eyed when they're loading people on trucks just the pleasure of
[01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:22.440]  that to these powerless weak scum it's an aphrodisiac to them well I can tell
[01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:27.200]  you that there's a lot of us who have decided that when when the shit does hit

[01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:08.520]  farmers Americans are losing access not just a raw milk and homemade cheeses but
[01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:12.040]  to healthy homecrafted sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut yoghurt
[01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:15.800]  and kefir it seems there's a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes and
[01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:19.360]  healthy bacteria but frankly I'm not sure what the food police are so afraid of
[01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:22.480]  these remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history with
[01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:25.680]  archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found across
[01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:30.000]  the globe in almost every culture even today Japanese eat miso Africans eat
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:34.480]  fermented porges Koreans eat kamichi and in India fermented milk is a staple for
[01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:38.200]  healthy living but here's some good news self-reliant Americans can now discover
[01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:41.680]  the secrets to making these amazing fermented foods legally and privately in
[01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:44.920]  their own homes since it's still legal to make these foods as long as you can
[01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:48.560]  make them yourself for more information check out fermentationfactor.com

[01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:23.040]  yes my friends and I am your host Alex Jones if you just joined us we have
[01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:28.320]  soldier X who is on base and near in the break I was talking to him and an
[01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:33.960]  officer walked over started giving him orders so he's getting out of that area
[01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:37.800]  that he's in and he's outside I don't know how long he can stay on with us we've
[01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:41.920]  confirmed who he is everything he's told us we've already reverse engineered
[01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:45.840]  and have Army training manuals and other sources I can confirm at all you
[01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:50.800]  saw Katrina where they went and took the guns of the high and dry people that
[01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:55.320]  they saw as preppers that were prepared and self-sufficient that's the enemy of
[01:08:55.320 --> 01:08:58.800]  the globalist globalism is about deindustrialization now I want you to
[01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:03.240]  recap everything you told me and then tell me the part about the I for NATO
[01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:10.160]  troops because in the NLE training national level exercise 9 10 11 12 they
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:14.480]  classified they said they train with troops from 14 nations to take on quote
[01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:19.800]  American terrorists so we do know that they do plan to use mercenaries they
[01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:23.600]  also want to use drones those can be pre-programmed to go take out patriots
[01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:28.120]  and then have plausible deniability even say terrorists blew up somebody's house
[01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:33.440]  so that's why we're going into this cyber war system as well God help us a
[01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:36.040]  lot of people are going to hear this and decide to serve the new world order
[01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:40.280]  they're gonna you know crouch down and lick the hand that feeds them those that
[01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:46.120]  cried appease appease were hung by those they tried to to please when freedom
[01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:52.200]  fails the good men rot in filthy jails this is the globalist takeover I mean
[01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:54.880]  they're coming out in the open Ted Turner's on the news saying he wants
[01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:58.280]  troops to commit suicide it's a good thing played that clip last hour I'm not
[01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:01.800]  joking we'll play it again we have open world government being announced on the
[01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:06.280]  news channels new world order was announced again with Ted Turner they
[01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:10.160]  are just doing it because a lot of the public is he doesn't know what planet
[01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:13.720]  they're on who are into sports entertainment and then those of us that
[01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:17.560]  are aware we're the enemy well obviously we're not under the mind control we're
[01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:22.640]  not under the okay recap everything you said get to the latest info and again
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:26.800]  then I want to talk to you about when they're in these meetings telling all of
[01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:29.920]  you that you know if you're a prepper or patriot you're the enemy you'll be dealt
[01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:33.760]  with if you you know we're going to get the guns if you don't go along with it
[01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:38.680]  you're gonna be dealt with I mean that is let me tell you folks I've never called
[01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:42.520]  for violence but don't go to a FEMA camp and don't let them take you away if
[01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:47.840]  people just go okay I'll go with you they're gonna win and my god I mean
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:52.600]  this is real ladies and gentlemen this is so insane but it's real it's history
[01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:55.480]  look at all the other countries what they've gone through it's all being set
[01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:59.600]  up here the government 1.6 billion bullets okay you've got the floor we'll
[01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:05.040]  call you soldier X known does we have your military ID history whole deal
[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:09.080]  made some calls confirm things but everything you're saying and Melissa
[01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:13.040]  Belton's article off Rob do's report last night has all the links to backing up
[01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:17.360]  in mainstream news what you've said but you're putting it all together recap it
[01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:22.400]  all okay basically what's happening is the troops are being told that they're
[01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:27.280]  going to be used in the civil unrest they expect to happen before during and
[01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:33.120]  after the election there's been prepping for the certification for taking over
[01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:38.520]  grocery stores fuel points gas stations basically shutting everything down and
[01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:43.320]  setting up makeshift points where if you want stuff you're going to have to go
[01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:47.040]  to the American government to get it which means if you own guns if you own
[01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:50.760]  weapons or anything you're gonna have to turn those things over in order to get
[01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:56.600]  these things you need to survive and basically they've said that any of
[01:11:56.600 --> 01:12:00.360]  these doomsday preppers will be treated as terrorists and that any of us
[01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:04.200]  National Guard guys who consider ourselves doomsday preppers would be
[01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:08.200]  treated as defects and would be handled accordingly in these meetings when
[01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:12.600]  they've told us these things it's kind of like shock and all I mean you they
[01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:16.640]  don't tell you these things and in your head you know you'd never thought you'd
[01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:19.920]  hear that from your leaders that you know this is actually happening in our
[01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:23.360]  country it's always something that you see happening in living yeah they might
[01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:26.480]  as well they might as well slap you know hammers and sickles on the sides of
[01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:33.840]  the tanks right go ahead keep going and so basically what we see happening
[01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:37.120]  because I know there's a big number of troops that aren't going to want to go
[01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:44.520]  along with this fascist movement and they're going to want to basically break
[01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:50.200]  away and join the rest of the Patriots in the fight against the this movement
[01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:56.360]  and so our question was you know if we walk away who are they going to have to
[01:12:56.360 --> 01:13:01.520]  fight for you know every day we hear the news about how over no longer war we're
[01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:05.840]  just peacekeeping and all this but if we're not at war then why are we
[01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:09.520]  preparing for when they're still building war fighting vehicles they're still
[01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:13.200]  building war fighting equipment they're still doing they have the biggest
[01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:17.160]  defense budget ever they just don't under the UN model where they go around
[01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:20.640]  murdering bombing slaughtering raping killing people putting them in slave
[01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:25.360]  labor camps just look it up look up UN sex trade UN slave camps UN slave labor
[01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:29.480]  everywhere they call it peacekeeping it's like Obama is the peace prize winner
[01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:34.280]  all these new wars with al-qaeda helping al-qaeda our government working with
[01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:38.400]  al-qaeda are called peace operations and he'll he'll get more awards the more
[01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:42.440]  people he kills so it's all a big sick joke but they signed deals with the
[01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:47.360]  Mexican and Canadian government a decade ago to quote work together to fight
[01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:52.640]  terrorists inside the US or insurrections the now now now talking to
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:56.120]  people what percentage roughly of the National Guard troops in Texas that you
[01:13:56.120 --> 01:14:01.480]  talked to are realize what they're hearing is the equivalent of you know
[01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:05.520]  Soviet troops parachuting out of the sky I mean it's just open in your face
[01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:20.840]  totally illegal totally criminal totally off the chart evil yeah that's
[01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:24.240]  that's the numbers we've got and so what they're gonna do is they're going to
[01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:29.240]  attack the military and say patriots did it just be ready for that and again if
[01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:31.840]  you're an offshore global crime syndicate that wants to bring down the
[01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:36.400]  United States and reorganize it what do you do you get the military and police
[01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:40.480]  who in your own manuals you say are your big enemies the high-level manuals say
[01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:43.480]  that's who they don't trust because they know on average they're not bad men and
[01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:47.160]  women they've been compartmentalized so you try to get the younger ones to hate
[01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:51.560]  the older ones this is the Nazis did this the Soviets did this when mal took
[01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:54.680]  over he did this two years of taking over Hitler did it less than a year
[01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:59.800]  night of the long knives look it up Lenin did it then Stalin did it then
[01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:03.600]  Khrushchev did it they always get rid of the last group whatever group brings
[01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:08.480]  them in they long knife okay and and that's it they do want to have it's
[01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:12.760]  called a purge of the military and police and look none of this has to
[01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:15.840]  happen I want to explain something I don't think this is probably I'm gonna
[01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:19.920]  tell you my gut I don't think this is gonna happen because we've gotten the
[01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:22.600]  word out you've gotten the word out I know the globalist model listen to me
[01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:26.920]  carefully I'm gonna get your take on this they put out these ideas over and
[01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:30.640]  over again I've been to drills you know 14 years ago witnessing just this and
[01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:34.720]  people saw it and said those can't be real Marines back then because it was
[01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:41.280]  just so alien now we've all just had it introduced the officers telling you
[01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:44.760]  this they're compartmentalized they don't know they're told to take notes on
[01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:48.520]  responses so their intelligence gathering because the foreign enemies
[01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:53.400]  taken over the officers are operating as foreign enemy agents now there they're
[01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:58.040]  assessing who will go along with this and they're marking them down for
[01:15:58.040 --> 01:16:03.800]  sheep dipping cadres to lead homeland brigade covert grips in for guard type
[01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:08.680]  grips okay you know show show that they're looking for people for the
[01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:13.920]  security services to really take out to take us down later and then they're
[01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:17.480]  identifying those of you to put on list they can't move against us now a
[01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:21.280]  foreign force can't move against us now they may be bold and try it though I've
[01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:28.440]  miscalculated before with how how arrogant and the unspeakable bravada
[01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:33.640]  I don't know the best term would be hubris of these people it's it's
[01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:37.840]  hubris the power of infinity but I don't they may try it though because here's
[01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:41.040]  the here's why maybe wrong when I'm wargaming all this in my mind and all
[01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:45.160]  my study they could plan it on being the civil war see either they want the
[01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:48.480]  civil war for us all to kill each other and they could drop the hammer but the
[01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:51.880]  military police will just be annihilated because what you mean even
[01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:57.480]  there's 170 million gun owners I estimate 10% once it starts will start
[01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:01.080]  resistant because it's not fear it's more people have just been in a sleep
[01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:04.800]  state people just go crazy and say it's time to die I mean I know my fellow
[01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:08.360]  Americans that it's going to be unbelievable if this actually happens
[01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:12.360]  it'll wipe out the police and military then they'll beg for the foreign assets
[01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:15.240]  to come help them they'll go into fortress modes which they've been
[01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:22.720]  preparing for y'all your take on that my take on that is that they're already
[01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:29.400]  wiping wiping those of us who aren't going to stand with them out there's
[01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:35.560]  been troops that recently have been kicked out of the military that have
[01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:41.160]  given 20 to 30 years of their lives to this military and they call it that
[01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:46.200]  they're doing cutbacks and replacing the ranks with new faces and new soldiers
[01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:51.600]  but we don't see the replacing at all all we see is to getting rid of and
[01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:55.640]  basically the way they're doing that is before the issue what they used to do
[01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:58.880]  they used to send you a random letter in the mail saying sorry you're out of a
[01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:02.680]  job and in the National Guard if you're a federal technician you have to be in
[01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:05.800]  the guard to have your job and once you get that letter saying sorry your
[01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:09.120]  service is no longer needed in the guard you're out of a job and there's no
[01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:12.920]  transition programs there's nothing in place to help you go from soldier to
[01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:17.000]  civilian and so basically they just throw you out on the street with nothing
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:22.400]  and basically that just seems like and again and they and then they're gonna
[01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:25.720]  make you the enemy they've said you're the enemy they make people serve six
[01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:29.920]  seven eight tours they never did more than one they know it destroys the
[01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:34.280]  troops they know it hurts them every they give you deadly vaccines while
[01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:37.920]  saying you're going to be a terrorist later everything was to destroy you I
[01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:45.120]  mean are the guys seeing that now yes and a lot of us believe that the anthrax
[01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:49.120]  shot we were given was was some sort of other experimental shot or even if it
[01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:52.920]  was anthrax shot no it was experimental and it was a slow kill I'm sorry to
[01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:59.520]  inform you okay well we ask questions we don't ever get any answers on stuff
[01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:03.920]  like that when they gave us anthrax shot they would make a fit there for 20 to
[01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:08.120]  30 minutes to see if we would have a severe reaction when our soldiers are
[01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:14.000]  coming home and dying and basically it seems like they're just wiping us all
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:18.920]  out and what they're gonna do is bring in some other country to take over this
[01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:23.200]  country no they are they've wiped us all out already they've killed us culturally
[01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:26.240]  I just can't believe this is actually happening they're either just getting
[01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:30.520]  everybody acclimated to do this down the road because they will fail but then
[01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:35.400]  failing it's more chaos more death if they go to the Civil War option it
[01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:41.680]  could be they could be getting ready to do it and man I just we got to get to
[01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:44.880]  work out but I know for new listeners out there this is blowing you away let's
[01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:48.040]  do one more segment or is that officer gonna come over again and tell you get
[01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:52.080]  back to work can you keep talking to us or you got to go I gotta go because like
[01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:59.040]  he's in the area and he's like all mine no I heard him during the break alright
[01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:01.960]  talk to you during the break we'll be right back Aaron full in here as the
[01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:05.800]  food police shut down food co-ops the Amish and small farmers Americans are
[01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:09.400]  losing access not just a raw milk and homemade cheeses but to healthy
[01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:13.240]  home-crafted sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut yogurt and kefir it
[01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:16.520]  seems there's a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy
[01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:20.120]  bacteria but frankly I'm not sure what the food police are so afraid of these
[01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:22.840]  remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history with
[01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:25.960]  archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found across
[01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:30.280]  the globe in almost every culture even today Japanese eat Miso Africans eat
[01:20:30.280 --> 01:20:34.720]  fermented porges Koreans eat kimchi and in India fermented milk is a staple for
[01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:38.040]  healthy living but here's some good news self-reliant Americans can now
[01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:41.240]  discover the secrets to making these amazing fermented foods legally and
[01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:44.720]  privately in their own homes since it's still legal to make these foods as long

[01:24:08.240 --> 01:24:11.880]  I was talking to my reporter some pretty seasoned back there and they said
[01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:16.600]  that it is time to go public if you defend the republic if you believe in
[01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:20.160]  defeating these people you've got a fight in the info war 90% of war is
[01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:24.040]  information we have the moral high ground when you're being taught to
[01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:27.520]  confiscate guns and being taught that people that are prepared like Mormons
[01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:31.680]  and Amish and people that's who they're targeting Christians conservatives
[01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:36.120]  libertarians when you're being taught they're the enemy folks that is that is
[01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:41.440]  Soviet Union man that is so bad and I believe me I'm up the top of the list
[01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:45.840]  here I'm getting chills right now but I'm just like hey praise God I've done
[01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:49.760]  the right thing I've been right I've studied this we're trying to stop this
[01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:53.560]  as best we can we need to pray for this country we need to pray for those that
[01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:57.800]  have been steadfast and have tried to be good we need to pray to avert this but
[01:24:57.800 --> 01:25:01.280]  you know then I think well this country's killed 52 million babies in
[01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:04.360]  abortion this country's been the heart of the Empire and of course we're going
[01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:08.600]  to be brought down for it it's just look at how they destroy the trips
[01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:11.720]  everything they do is to hurt them everything they do is to demonize them
[01:25:11.720 --> 01:25:15.000]  they give them deadly illegal anthrac shots it's illegal to give that
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:18.640]  experimental shot that's come out in court they just keep doing it they gave
[01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:22.440]  them experimental smallpox shots but it killed so many they had to stop it a
[01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:28.680]  few years ago and they just do this to these people while finding the ones
[01:25:28.680 --> 01:25:33.120]  that will shoot at Americans just like TSA it's there to find people that'll
[01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:38.880]  grab old ladies genitals they're creating an army of idiots and evil
[01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:43.480]  people and control freaks and perverts and and that they just can't find a lot
[01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:46.200]  in the military ranks even though a lot of poor people and stuff joined the
[01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:50.200]  military they still you know people know they can be killed doing it so you
[01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:52.640]  still get some good people in the military because they're people that
[01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:56.360]  have courage and even if you're silly and ignorant you've got guts and guts
[01:25:56.360 --> 01:26:01.600]  is enough the quote full metal jacket and it's true and you know what it's time
[01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:04.920]  to codify your facts it's time to go public then they'll call you in and
[01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:08.120]  threaten the court marshal if you don't shut up then everybody shuts up but by
[01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:11.600]  then it's already out it's time for all the officers that aren't total scum and
[01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:15.560]  and for the enlisted people and the and the non-commissioned officers and
[01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:21.280]  others I mean to speak out and to say no to this I mean here's the Washington
[01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:27.000]  Times right here Napolitano stands by controversial report only that's
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.960]  Secretary-General Napolitano said Wednesday that she was briefed before
[01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:33.160]  the release of the controversial intelligence assessment we released
[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:37.160]  that and that she stands by the report which lists returning veterans among
[01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:43.800]  terrorist risk to the US that was April 16 2009 okay now we've released I don't
[01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:46.480]  know probably 20 of these reports over the years we've been given by FBI
[01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:50.640]  federal marshal state police military you name it and people always go that
[01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:55.560]  can't be real until they admit it's real since then we've gotten reeducation
[01:26:55.560 --> 01:26:59.640]  camp documents that the army responded to and said yeah those are real you're
[01:26:59.640 --> 01:27:04.480]  not supposed to have those and then they released it like it's like Ted Turner
[01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:09.040]  saying I think troops should commit suicide on CNN two days ago and it's not
[01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:16.840]  even a news issue we're that broken we'll put up with anything now we're gonna
[01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:21.240]  go to break and I want to hear from military I want to hear from police and
[01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:23.400]  I'll try to go to you as quickly as possible make your statement go to the
[01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:28.080]  next person because I'm bad about asking 50 questions and look you got to choose
[01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:33.440]  aside here I mean this is a master plan to take over my studied history it's
[01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:36.480]  an amalgamation of what every authoritarians done the last hundred
[01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:43.280]  years I mean it gives me chills I'm getting chills right now makes me grind
[01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:46.680]  my teeth I don't normally do that just makes me clench my teeth it is so real
[01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:51.800]  it is so authoritarian it is so bad if they're able to execute this if they
[01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:57.240]  pull the trigger on this man it is we're gonna enter hell on earth we're
[01:27:57.240 --> 01:28:01.440]  talking civil war they're gonna brand as a revolution they're gonna break up the
[01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:07.160]  US they're gonna bring in foreign troops after the military and the police go
[01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:11.120]  into this war against the American people and it's targeted they're gonna
[01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:16.320]  have us the Patriots the long knife the police and military don't be part of
[01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:20.760]  this you idiots especially arrogant police that think it's fun to be a
[01:28:20.760 --> 01:28:25.240]  tyrant it's not gonna be fun once the gloves come off we do not want to go
[01:28:25.240 --> 01:28:29.560]  here we do not want to have this happen they've got fake anonymous groups and
[01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:33.640]  others and talk show hosted others who are being able to say things on air and
[01:28:33.640 --> 01:28:37.640]  things that I know their agents like Hal Turner calling for violent storming of
[01:28:37.640 --> 01:28:41.080]  the White House calling for killing calling for bombing government

[01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:01.400]  that's a foregone conclusion we can stop this if we get the word out but I'm
[01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:04.960]  telling you the enemy is testing everything right now and if they think
[01:29:04.960 --> 01:29:08.920]  they can win a civil war or if they think they can execute this and they
[01:29:08.920 --> 01:29:13.680]  think you're gonna roll over like Lindsay Williams source said hey if we roll
[01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:17.040]  over to these tests without getting really angry and vocal they're gonna
[01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:20.480]  pull the trigger every other country's been overrun and taken over by
[01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:24.720]  authoritarian's every country in the last hundred years and they line people up

[01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:08.840]  deeper and deeper into classical authoritarianism I could go on for
[01:34:08.840 --> 01:34:12.640]  hours all the examples of corruption and tyranny you know yesterday I called the
[01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:18.200]  Austin City Council criminal and you know I was talking about how most cities
[01:34:18.200 --> 01:34:22.800]  are run by people that just engage in all sorts of inside deals all sorts of
[01:34:22.800 --> 01:34:26.080]  things and here it is today and then I'll get into the really big news in your
[01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:34.640]  phone calls out of the Austin American statesman kicks and you name it city
[01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:38.960]  council warned on open meetings violation county attorney agrees to defer
[01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:43.680]  prosecution and for over a decade they meet in secret they give each other
[01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:49.000]  business deals they be all sorts of sweetheart deals I mean it's like
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:53.160]  Chicago or New York or something and they just break everybody's will and of
[01:34:53.160 --> 01:34:57.040]  course turns out that the attorneys that work for the city in the county they've
[01:34:57.040 --> 01:35:01.480]  been in little meetings with people and have made their own little good old boy
[01:35:01.480 --> 01:35:06.720]  deals and now nobody gets in trouble or thousands of meetings oh and they spent
[01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:11.920]  half a million dollars that on outside law firms to certify it was okay for
[01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:17.240]  them to not get in trouble so just everything is is shucking us dry
[01:35:17.240 --> 01:35:22.600]  everything is a giant scam and here in Austin they just come and take people's
[01:35:22.600 --> 01:35:27.040]  property pay them in some cases nothing call it environmental preserve and they
[01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:30.560]  don't even wait five years now in two years they turn around and shell it and
[01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:34.400]  take the restrictions off and then they have former mayors and people that own
[01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:41.400]  the banks that you've got to go to to get the building money if you want the
[01:35:41.400 --> 01:35:46.080]  restrictions taken off I mean it's just absolutely a joke they've certified our
[01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:49.920]  elections at the state level our fraudulent where I live we're a UN
[01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:55.960]  model city it's a joke it's a joke people like to realize we don't vote in
[01:35:55.960 --> 01:35:59.840]  Travis County that's why it's so criminal that's why they do whatever they
[01:35:59.840 --> 01:36:05.120]  want we've got to realize how much trouble we're in and I know you're
[01:36:05.120 --> 01:36:07.640]  listening all over the country all over the world I know the similar stuff's
[01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:13.280]  going on in your area and they've said yes they they violated the law I mean
[01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:18.760]  they could be in jail for years huge fines but they're gonna defer that and
[01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:25.400]  they're not gonna get in trouble so there you go kicks and just again that's why
[01:36:25.400 --> 01:36:28.000]  we're in so much trouble because these people get away with anything and
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:33.200]  everything now I want to hear what you have to say about this if you're active
[01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:38.520]  duty military or police or a security contractor because I know you've all
[01:36:38.520 --> 01:36:42.000]  been told this I mean everything that military man was just telling us I
[01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:46.960]  already have in the news articles with links to where they admit preppers being
[01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:51.160]  put on no fly list we famous preppers from TV shows with no criminal record go
[01:36:51.160 --> 01:36:56.840]  get grabbed and thrown in jail and everything taken no judge no jury they
[01:36:56.840 --> 01:37:00.280]  have a civilian inmate labor camp program I've been to the urban drills
[01:37:00.280 --> 01:37:03.960]  they admit they're training the Boy Scouts and others for gun confiscation
[01:37:03.960 --> 01:37:07.560]  I've got the New York Times saying how great it is I've got the new Army
[01:37:07.560 --> 01:37:12.520]  manual saying preparing on how to lock down cities and move in incrementally
[01:37:12.520 --> 01:37:16.720]  street-by-street and take the guns how to announce turn your guns in get your
[01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:21.280]  new government ID card and you won't go to the FEMA camp I mean they're gonna
[01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:26.160]  make examples of people there and I what's terrible about this is you can't
[01:37:26.160 --> 01:37:30.680]  go to the FEMA camp you have to resist this criminal takeover this is red dawn
[01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:34.440]  that they're thinking about pulling on us completely not slow motion anymore
[01:37:34.440 --> 01:37:39.760]  but hot but then it even when you fight back you're fighting back against poor
[01:37:39.760 --> 01:37:43.720]  soft kill victims full of deadly vaccines that drink fluoride and who were
[01:37:43.720 --> 01:37:49.760]  scared themselves and in order to do it but it's just the way it is and you know
[01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:53.000]  I just wish we could arrest Ted Turner he's part of all sorts of crimes with a
[01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:56.360]  U.N. and I've got a stack of news articles right here Sunday Times of
[01:37:56.360 --> 01:38:00.280]  London billionaire club and bid to curb over population all their programs put
[01:38:00.280 --> 01:38:04.320]  stuff in the vaccines the water Wall Street Journal millionaires tried to

[01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:13.080]  billionaire club six population control and then I got eco science where they
[01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:16.480]  talked about the plan in the 70s to spike the air and water to sterilize us
[01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:19.240]  and kill us and now they're doing it everything they talk about in this book
[01:38:19.240 --> 01:38:24.280]  they were already implementing then what was this written 1970 I forget the
[01:38:24.280 --> 01:38:30.640]  date here you think I'm joking eco science it's online read it free people
[01:38:30.640 --> 01:38:40.080]  scanned it 1970 this is an updated 1977 there you go I mean I'm sorry reality so
[01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:44.760]  crazy Stalin killing 50 million Lenin killing 25 million Hitler killing 20
[01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:51.400]  million Mao killing 60 plus million old pot killing 30% of the Cambodians I mean
[01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:58.440]  this is the way it works Illuminati French Revolution over a million killed
[01:38:58.440 --> 01:39:03.600]  this is what governments do and if we don't get back to our forefathers who
[01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:07.200]  said we'll look out for this who said you need guns to protect yourself from
[01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:10.360]  this who said you better keep local control it's all over toll-free number
[01:39:10.360 --> 01:39:19.480]  join us 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 but again if you're a new listener go look
[01:39:19.480 --> 01:39:24.320]  it up they have said publicly for three and a half years veterans are the
[01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:28.960]  number one terror threat and that's what the troops and police trained to fight
[01:39:28.960 --> 01:39:33.440]  now they're saying that because they know you're not gonna go along they know a
[01:39:33.440 --> 01:39:37.640]  lot of you have killed people are been around it and you and you're not and
[01:39:37.640 --> 01:39:41.800]  you've got guilt over wars and stuff and they know you're not gonna go along
[01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:45.560]  with the New World Order well they plan to use the current military and police
[01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:50.080]  to touch you down and kill you that's why they're putting veterans on no fly
[01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:54.440]  list veterans no criminal records can't buy guns in many cases now and all the
[01:39:54.440 --> 01:39:58.520]  military and police doing this you're gonna be on that list next to it's time
[01:39:58.520 --> 01:40:02.920]  to just say no to this is there no orders you won't follow is there nothing you
[01:40:02.920 --> 01:40:07.520]  won't do I'm gonna shut up go to Ken Allen Josh and many others but I want to

[01:41:20.360 --> 01:41:24.760]  grandfather's an intelligence and he's got some ideas off of me as well what he
[01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:30.400]  has told me is what he sees happening is more of a modern-day siege warfare the
[01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:36.400]  idea is really kind of to sit back let people run out of supplies he knows that
[01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:40.840]  that's gonna break loose with chaos you're gonna see people you're just
[01:41:40.840 --> 01:41:44.560]  gonna be looting rioting shootings people gonna run out of food and they're
[01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:49.240]  gonna come to the military for help and then Homeland Security well that's what
[01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:54.080]  the military man was just telling us our source mr. X soldier X though that's
[01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:58.040]  the plan and then those of us that do have some food and water and guns we're
[01:41:58.040 --> 01:42:01.640]  terrorists and they're gonna tell the public they've got food their terrorist
[01:42:01.640 --> 01:42:06.040]  and the general yuppie scum will cheer as we're being hung at sports stadiums
[01:42:06.040 --> 01:42:11.880]  I'm telling you exactly and what he's seen is you know what they're gonna do
[01:42:11.880 --> 01:42:15.640]  is they're gonna let all this happen for you know five or six months and the
[01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:20.640]  military is gonna lay back let it all happen and through the chaos after
[01:42:20.640 --> 01:42:23.520]  everyone starts run out of ammo because there's people storing thousands of
[01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:26.720]  rounds and you know as someone who's done a lot of shooting you know thousands
[01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:30.840]  of rounds run it can run out very quickly once all this stuff starts running
[01:42:30.840 --> 01:42:34.160]  out all these people are gonna be begging for help and that's when the
[01:42:34.160 --> 01:42:37.280]  military is gonna roll in and when this happens that's what they're doing the
[01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:41.000]  euro admits they're imploding that to totally have them go under EU dictatorship
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:45.120]  the countries are being forced to sign over their final sovereignty and have
[01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:49.320]  you seen the new EU signs Kurt Nemo wrote about this on the official EU site
[01:42:49.320 --> 01:42:54.120]  it's a giant star with a hammer and sickle at the top with hammers and sickles
[01:42:54.120 --> 01:42:59.000]  all over it I mean the hammers and sickles I mean what more do we need here
[01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:03.040]  exactly and what this is gonna do this is gonna give the troops kind of the
[01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:05.560]  moral high ground when they roll in because they're gonna think oh we're
[01:43:05.560 --> 01:43:08.520]  just running and trying to help that's exactly what they did in Katrina they
[01:43:08.520 --> 01:43:12.240]  didn't run into Katrina immediately as soon as things set off they waited they
[01:43:12.240 --> 01:43:15.600]  laid back for things to get crazy and then a lot of the troops were thinking
[01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:19.600]  well you know if we're taking guns we're helping people exactly and they sat
[01:43:19.600 --> 01:43:22.320]  there and jammed the police communication so things would break down I
[01:43:22.320 --> 01:43:25.940]  appreciate your call a lot of times we get a lot of current military and
[01:43:25.940 --> 01:43:30.720]  police calling and we're not getting that right now we've got recent army
[01:43:30.720 --> 01:43:34.720]  Josh in Florida then Ken guy Dave and others Josh you're on the air what's
[01:43:34.720 --> 01:43:39.320]  your take on what we're breaking down here I just want to say I called you
[01:43:39.320 --> 01:43:43.320]  before and I'll contact you about being an Iraq veteran we use naked body
[01:43:43.320 --> 01:43:48.240]  scanners in Iraq we use the pat downs we use all that stuff and that's coming
[01:43:48.240 --> 01:43:51.920]  over here no MIT said this was the model that would be in America that we're
[01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:56.120]  gonna live like living in America will be like living in Fallujah I mean this is
[01:43:56.120 --> 01:43:58.480]  what it's gonna be like you go to the grocery store they're gonna grow up you
[01:43:58.480 --> 01:44:01.280]  there you give them a problem they're gonna spray bullets into you up against
[01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:05.120]  the wall this is the takeover yes and I want to verify a couple things you've
[01:44:05.120 --> 01:44:08.480]  been mentioning yes right it's military I could definitely sit at two degrees
[01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:12.440]  and why we're such a threat we would train how to shoot we're physically fit
[01:44:12.440 --> 01:44:16.520]  we have a first aid training we're trained in urban warfare we're trying to
[01:44:16.520 --> 01:44:20.320]  how to collect intelligence and out of report it so yes and and I feel guilty
[01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:26.600]  while being in the Iraq war to come back from it I went to occupy Miami for
[01:44:26.600 --> 01:44:30.560]  months with the in the war to the fed side because I was so pissed off about
[01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:33.800]  except for to upset by it so yeah we're not going to go on with the mean world
[01:44:33.800 --> 01:44:38.880]  order and one last thing about the pigs the Portugal Ireland Italy Greece
[01:44:38.880 --> 01:44:44.040]  state if they were to realize and I know that you know what their country is
[01:44:44.040 --> 01:44:47.040]  doing to what the banks were doing to them beforehand that maybe they would
[01:44:47.040 --> 01:44:50.120]  been collapsed if they were to resist well that's what I'm telling you because
[01:44:50.120 --> 01:44:53.360]  we're different because of the Second Amendment we may be able to stop this
[01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:57.360]  but the globalists see hey they got a Second Amendment let's just collapse it
[01:44:57.360 --> 01:45:02.120]  let them kill each other it is just so horrible and and we've got to have
[01:45:02.120 --> 01:45:05.920]  military and police start speaking out now if enough people start speaking out
[01:45:05.920 --> 01:45:10.320]  even anonymously it'll gain critical mass and we can back this off we've got
[01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:16.200]  power if we use it good to hear from you let's go to Ken in Minnesota former
[01:45:16.200 --> 01:45:22.400]  Navy give us your quick take on that go ahead hello Alex long-time listener God
[01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:26.600]  bless you your staff for the work that you're doing your true patriots say up
[01:45:26.600 --> 01:45:30.520]  and for your staff and for your listeners I want you to all listen real
[01:45:30.520 --> 01:45:34.720]  close because this is going to ring a bell here Mike Adams sat in for you Alex
[01:45:34.720 --> 01:45:39.800]  back on August 6th and I recall Mike talking about how they want to make the
[01:45:39.800 --> 01:45:44.520]  veterans look like the bad guy he was so really right and so correct about that
[01:45:44.520 --> 01:45:52.600]  on Monday August 13th 2012 this year the TV series major crimes which is an
[01:45:52.600 --> 01:45:59.280]  offshoot from the closure on the TNT network premiered its first episode and
[01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:04.560]  it was from 9 to 10 subject time just a week after Mike Adams brought the
[01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:09.120]  subject up on the veterans being the villains the TNT network allowed this
[01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:15.760]  trash to be seen by the public it was a I as an honor to discharge veteran I'm
[01:46:15.760 --> 01:46:21.000]  pretty furious about this and I and I've just noticed it as I get there they've
[01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:28.800]  got more than 10 new TV shows ABC NBC CBS TNT all of them where veterans are
[01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:32.400]  murdering terrorists that hurt children and the police come and take them out
[01:46:32.400 --> 01:46:35.960]  and the good military comes and takes them out and they show the public now
[01:46:35.960 --> 01:46:40.120]  we're gonna have a war with the veterans just like before 9-11 they had TV shows
[01:46:40.120 --> 01:46:45.440]  about Al Qaeda I'm telling you this is how they're they are preparing the
[01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:51.120]  mines prepping the mines for a civil war and then the average cops just like the
[01:46:51.120 --> 01:46:54.400]  general public so dumb down they're like well if it's on TV veterans are bad you
[01:46:54.400 --> 01:47:00.200]  know go ahead I'm sorry yeah anyways and if anybody wants any more proof of
[01:47:00.200 --> 01:47:05.520]  that if you have like on demand all you got to do is punch it on demand look up
[01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:11.360]  what do they do on the show they showed his guys coming in into a town there and
[01:47:11.360 --> 01:47:14.920]  they're just blasting up a bank and all this and and they're digging into it and
[01:47:14.920 --> 01:47:20.000]  digging into it and it felt right makes the veteran look like the bad guy of
[01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:23.240]  course that's I mean they admit the government pays for that they pay for
[01:47:23.240 --> 01:47:28.160]  pro Obama messages pro government-run healthcare messages I mean we live they
[01:47:28.160 --> 01:47:32.320]  really want to take over they think they can do it with a civil war just like
[01:47:32.320 --> 01:47:35.800]  they're starting to see it soon these civil wars in the Middle East good to hear from you
[01:47:35.800 --> 01:47:41.640]  again we normally can load the phones up with police and military current who
[01:47:41.640 --> 01:47:45.160]  call in and speak out against all this or can confirm you know some of the
[01:47:45.160 --> 01:47:50.240]  things we're talking about or deny it I already know it's all true is there no
[01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:54.360]  order you police would you kill your children of order to probably some of
[01:47:54.360 --> 01:47:58.120]  you I mean I mean that's where this goes would you would you send your daddy to
[01:47:58.120 --> 01:48:02.200]  the FEMA camp because he doesn't love the New World Order I mean that's the
[01:48:02.200 --> 01:48:06.000]  question eight hundred two five nine nine two three one I know we've got the
[01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:10.360]  phones loaded with former military and police I want to hear from current I'm
[01:48:10.360 --> 01:48:14.520]  not knocking all these people I just want them here from current Dave in
[01:48:14.520 --> 01:48:18.840]  Florida ex-air force the next army ex-marine God bless you sir go ahead
[01:48:18.840 --> 01:48:25.040]  what's your take on all this I'm Air Force retired I was a contractor for
[01:48:25.040 --> 01:48:30.840]  Northwick Grumman for about six to eight years and I'd like to back up what
[01:48:30.840 --> 01:48:36.120]  that soldier said I've been purged out of the system also because I believed in
[01:48:36.120 --> 01:48:42.240]  the New World Order and I would speak out against it so I've been unemployed for
[01:48:42.240 --> 01:48:46.320]  over three years so like when you see them announced on TV that they're
[01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:49.240]  setting up world government you would speak out against it and they said that
[01:48:49.240 --> 01:48:55.440]  doesn't exist your fire no they didn't fire me they they laid us off and they
[01:48:55.440 --> 01:48:58.880]  terminated the contract well you know they build a lot of the components now
[01:48:58.880 --> 01:49:04.360]  in China and places so they don't need you anymore well that's true and I worked
[01:49:04.360 --> 01:49:13.400]  in weapons systems so I did a job that I monitored a lot of stuff and I worked
[01:49:13.400 --> 01:49:20.600]  with radar basically and I'm in the Gulf of Mexico and we could trace every
[01:49:20.600 --> 01:49:24.760]  aircraft that flew in the United States they have a program that traces this
[01:49:24.760 --> 01:49:31.920]  many people don't know this for 9-11 all that is bullshit you tell me a lot of
[01:49:31.920 --> 01:49:35.160]  military callers here the cuss words are flying we have to delay that out yes
[01:49:35.160 --> 01:49:39.960]  we understand it's a Bravo Sierra or how do you say it and we don't need any more
[01:49:39.960 --> 01:49:44.240]  of that yeah of course they they they order the transponders off turn them
[01:49:44.240 --> 01:49:48.720]  all off they're all hardwired is what you're saying and it's pure baloney what
[01:49:48.720 --> 01:49:54.400]  I did was when aircraft crashed I sent the rescue people planes to find them
[01:49:54.400 --> 01:49:58.600]  because you know when their transponders stops we send out aircraft to find them
[01:49:58.600 --> 01:50:04.760]  like the Hendricks motors thing that crashed in Alabama so what's your take
[01:50:04.760 --> 01:50:08.680]  on all this you're gonna try to cause a civil war and have the patriots of the
[01:50:08.680 --> 01:50:14.200]  police kill each other or is this all just more conditioning well I think
[01:50:14.200 --> 01:50:18.840]  they're gonna crash the dollar first and then the people will do whatever they
[01:50:18.840 --> 01:50:23.800]  have to because in Katrina which I've seen they you know cut off the food and
[01:50:23.800 --> 01:50:28.360]  water supply and the power and then they can control the people they'll control
[01:50:28.360 --> 01:50:33.280]  the highways I also went after the military and I wanted to get into
[01:50:33.280 --> 01:50:37.960]  emergency emergency management training because I wanted to help people and
[01:50:37.960 --> 01:50:42.360]  when I found out that they did all this stuff and took control of the people I
[01:50:42.360 --> 01:50:49.080]  couldn't do it anymore I also went and trained for TSA past all the stuff and
[01:50:49.080 --> 01:50:53.880]  then when they gave me the questionnaire I was never given an interview because I
[01:50:53.880 --> 01:50:57.680]  wouldn't molest people that's right no they do that they find molesters God
[01:50:57.680 --> 01:51:02.720]  bless you sir got key calls coming up the worst drought in 50 years continues
[01:51:02.720 --> 01:51:07.400]  and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record 78% of

[01:51:19.360 --> 01:51:23.680]  food prices the only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at

[01:51:27.920 --> 01:51:31.560]  the price of raw ingredients increases eat foods will have to raise prices to

[01:54:22.960 --> 01:54:28.960]  affiliate we're getting so many and he's former special forces gonna give us
[01:54:28.960 --> 01:54:32.800]  his take on all this you know I have clips I can play right now of army troops
[01:54:32.800 --> 01:54:36.440]  saying they will kill Americans in Katrina and did go to houses and take
[01:54:36.440 --> 01:54:40.440]  the guns I have video of it so don't forget that's the default position and
[01:54:40.440 --> 01:54:45.720]  we have the training manuals and this is the problem of big government people
[01:54:45.720 --> 01:54:49.120]  that love big government and say it's gonna help people it allows tyrants to
[01:54:49.120 --> 01:54:53.160]  get in and have questionnaires and things and hire people that will do
[01:54:53.160 --> 01:55:00.120]  anything they're told and we're in a lot of trouble I mean the globalist can sit
[01:55:00.120 --> 01:55:04.120]  back while there's a civil war in this country and that is their plan go ahead
[01:55:04.120 --> 01:55:10.320]  John in Wisconsin and make your point on this sir well the closest thing I can
[01:55:10.320 --> 01:55:13.680]  compare this to is I don't know if you've ever actually seen the show
[01:55:13.680 --> 01:55:18.760]  Jericho yes I saw one episode of it where contractors within the
[01:55:18.760 --> 01:55:23.000]  government nuke cities to bring in martial law to pose as saviors and then
[01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:28.720]  try to round up the patriots that's about where you're at I mean it's just a
[01:55:28.720 --> 01:55:37.560]  matter of time what do you make of how bold and crazy this is though well and
[01:55:37.560 --> 01:55:43.520]  there's so many things that I've seen that would blow your mind you know just
[01:55:43.520 --> 01:55:50.480]  how we treat other people in their own country I can only imagine if it just
[01:55:50.480 --> 01:55:56.120]  turns on us I don't know I hope that the American spirit will you know do it it
[01:55:56.120 --> 01:55:59.240]  always does well look at what they've gotten away with sodium fluoride in the
[01:55:59.240 --> 01:56:05.000]  water Kim trailing us NSA admits they're illegally spying on us the government
[01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:09.240]  funds al Qaeda and Libby in Syria Ted Turner goes on TV and says I like troops
[01:56:09.240 --> 01:56:13.280]  committing suicide they need to they're bad people I mean did you hear that clip
[01:56:13.280 --> 01:56:17.720]  when I played it and then that's two days ago and no one even talked about it
[01:56:17.720 --> 01:56:23.800]  well there's a lot of people that probably you know they don't want to
[01:56:23.800 --> 01:56:27.920]  believe it but that's what I mean though but I mean the EU just came out with
[01:56:27.920 --> 01:56:31.480]  their new symbol and I saw this and didn't believe it when looked on the
[01:56:31.480 --> 01:56:37.880]  official EU site it's a giant star with hammers and sickles I mean it's like the
[01:56:37.880 --> 01:56:41.800]  troops need to kill themselves hammer and sickles the families bad force and
[01:56:41.800 --> 01:56:45.240]  populations world governments good have you heard the newscast where they
[01:56:45.240 --> 01:56:50.680]  announced we're under world government now I have not I had to be honest with
[01:56:50.680 --> 01:56:56.960]  you every time I turn on the you know go to look at anything online it's it's just
[01:56:56.960 --> 01:57:02.600]  I wonder what the hell I even get over there no I hear you I mean what about
[01:57:02.600 --> 01:57:06.840]  your buddies are people I mean are they waking up is any are they concerned
[01:57:06.840 --> 01:57:17.560]  well it seems like everybody is I mean I honestly believe I hadn't actually seen
[01:57:17.560 --> 01:57:21.880]  that show Jericho but I have Netflix and I seen it on there and I kind of read
[01:57:21.880 --> 01:57:26.240]  it what it was about and I turn it on and I I mean this is basically about I
[01:57:26.240 --> 01:57:30.320]  mean it's just a matter of time we all know it we've seen you know if you could
[01:57:30.320 --> 01:57:34.160]  see the way that we treat people in their own country if we were to get
[01:57:34.160 --> 01:57:39.120]  treated like that I mean I don't know it it's only a matter of time before they
[01:57:39.120 --> 01:57:43.600]  start eliminating I'll be on the first of the list well that's the deal it'll
[01:57:43.600 --> 01:57:47.160]  be easy when they go out at the first high target high-value target list but
[01:57:47.160 --> 01:57:50.560]  after that people aren't gonna wait anymore they're gonna come for the
[01:57:50.560 --> 01:57:55.640]  idiots that follow these illegal orders this is a death sentence to the police
[01:57:55.640 --> 01:57:59.360]  and military that try to execute this within one week of launching these
[01:57:59.360 --> 01:58:04.120]  operations they will notice a complete shift and it will be open season and I
[01:58:04.120 --> 01:58:07.760]  don't want to go there I don't get some thrill about thinking about hundreds of
[01:58:07.760 --> 01:58:11.520]  thousands of dead military police well you were in special forces in Iraq from
[01:58:11.520 --> 01:58:14.640]  your military perspective I have a historical perspective plus how our
[01:58:14.640 --> 01:58:18.320]  country was founded I mean you concur that there will be massive resistance to
[01:58:18.320 --> 01:58:24.120]  this well I would hope that there is I mean we're cowboys that's what we are
[01:58:24.120 --> 01:58:29.600]  we're American we say certain nobody well it's all we got a bunch of commie
[01:58:29.600 --> 01:58:32.880]  new world order globalists running us and they're offshore and they want to
[01:58:32.880 --> 01:58:36.780]  bring this country down the answer to this is not have this civil war the
[01:58:36.780 --> 01:58:46.480]  answer is get the word out now you are listening to GCN visit GCN live comm

[01:58:59.320 --> 01:59:04.760]  model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce

[01:59:58.320 --> 02:00:00.720]  network
[02:00:04.720 --> 02:00:12.480]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[02:00:12.480 --> 02:00:19.960]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCM radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:19.960 --> 02:00:27.520]  Alex Jones all right Scott is anonymous not saying he's calling from active
[02:00:27.520 --> 02:00:32.000]  police and we want to get his take on all this I mean you have to understand I
[02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:35.360]  don't just have some action guard guy on saying they're being told to get ready
[02:00:35.360 --> 02:00:39.680]  for gun confiscation and martial law and shutting down infrastructure I have the
[02:00:39.680 --> 02:00:43.400]  executive orders I have the new Army training manuals I've shot the video I've
[02:00:43.400 --> 02:00:47.520]  talked to the other sources I have the Army times this is all hiding in plain
[02:00:47.520 --> 02:00:51.360]  view because when they get ready to actually go operational pull the trigger
[02:00:51.360 --> 02:00:54.760]  they have to go ahead and roll it all out and see that's the thing this has
[02:00:54.760 --> 02:00:58.960]  always been hidden this is now rolling out now that may just be some new sigh
[02:00:58.960 --> 02:01:03.360]  off because let me tell you this is not going to go well for the government most
[02:01:03.360 --> 02:01:06.520]  people will roll over five to ten percent or not and it is going to be
[02:01:06.520 --> 02:01:10.880]  devastating the globalist couldn't even hold Baghdad but see that's the plan the
[02:01:10.880 --> 02:01:16.120]  globalist that offshore the plan was to tear up Iraq and tear up our trips see
[02:01:16.120 --> 02:01:21.080]  when you understand it's chaos they want then you're like oh I get it let's go
[02:01:21.080 --> 02:01:25.960]  to Scott an anonymous active police officer what do you think of all the
[02:01:25.960 --> 02:01:28.840]  stuff being covered here do you agree disagree what's your take on it I
[02:01:28.840 --> 02:01:32.080]  absolutely agree with you Alex and first of all I want to say God bless you for
[02:01:32.080 --> 02:01:37.760]  what you're doing and we need we need many more people like you as far as I
[02:01:37.760 --> 02:01:43.400]  can see I've been a police officer in a class 1 a city on the east coast for
[02:01:43.400 --> 02:01:48.480]  approximately 10 years and I can tell you from the people that I've encountered
[02:01:48.480 --> 02:01:54.320]  on a vast majority basis my co-workers that it's and I believe it or not this
[02:01:54.320 --> 02:01:59.720]  city is incredibly liberal but the majority of the police officers are not
[02:01:59.720 --> 02:02:05.320]  going to at least in this city rank and file follow orders they are waking up
[02:02:05.320 --> 02:02:13.440]  exponentially we have an incredibly large veteran population within our ranks
[02:02:13.440 --> 02:02:19.000]  and what we have noticed is in the past several months maybe maybe a year at the
[02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:25.280]  most there's a lot more federal police officers doing their supposed job in our
[02:02:25.280 --> 02:02:31.080]  city but there's just a lot more we encounter a lot more activity sure
[02:02:31.080 --> 02:02:33.920]  sure let me stop you I want to hold you in the next segment because some
[02:02:33.920 --> 02:02:37.080]  stations don't carry this segment and what you're saying officer so important
[02:02:37.080 --> 02:02:42.160]  that's it I see giant black armored trucks and say homeland security I see
[02:02:42.160 --> 02:02:47.680]  police cars truck little trucks medium-sized trucks suburban's and and
[02:02:47.680 --> 02:02:51.440]  cops all over again these little federal ID cards to be like little deputies of
[02:02:51.440 --> 02:02:55.800]  feds it's in regard with the citizens all that the churches suddenly have these
[02:02:55.800 --> 02:02:59.600]  weird federal consultants in them telling them what to say it's a total
[02:02:59.600 --> 02:03:03.760]  takeover because they can't they know most police are good people because they
[02:03:03.760 --> 02:03:08.920]  live in the real world they're just bringing in their own goons absolutely
[02:03:08.920 --> 02:03:17.440]  wow so something continue to elaborate on this it's just my my my a very humble
[02:03:17.440 --> 02:03:21.480]  viewpoint you know just things that we observe and you know it's you're kind
[02:03:21.480 --> 02:03:25.360]  of cop between a rock and a hard place you don't want to be too vocal because
[02:03:25.360 --> 02:03:28.160]  then you're going to be labeled as one of those nuts and we're under so much
[02:03:28.160 --> 02:03:32.040]  scrutiny as it is even they go so far as you know you go to work and start
[02:03:32.040 --> 02:03:35.400]  talking about you know watching the the prepper show on National Geographic and
[02:03:35.400 --> 02:03:39.360]  you know you don't know who's listening and it's just it's just ridiculous to
[02:03:39.360 --> 02:03:46.080]  paranoia and as a matter of fact two months ago we had a briefing a roll
[02:03:46.080 --> 02:03:49.880]  call briefing with some of our officers that are stationed with Department of
[02:03:49.880 --> 02:03:53.040]  Homeland Security it's like a their detailed there but it was all about
[02:03:53.040 --> 02:03:57.640]  the Fusion Center and I couldn't believe it you know they gave us pamphlets of
[02:03:57.640 --> 02:04:01.800]  their goal their mission what they're doing how our how our technology is
[02:04:01.800 --> 02:04:07.680]  linking up to that and it's just you know it's it's unbelievable by the way
[02:04:07.680 --> 02:04:10.560]  you're only being told a fraction if you can't stay with us five more minutes
[02:04:10.560 --> 02:04:14.160]  because I want you to come back recapping it into that but we know via
[02:04:14.160 --> 02:04:18.160]  congressional releases what these Fusion Centers do they don't tell the rank and
[02:04:18.160 --> 02:04:23.040]  file police they pick minions to be part of the system the intelligence bureau
[02:04:23.040 --> 02:04:29.920]  the SWAT team others who were brought you a special response teams the special
[02:04:29.920 --> 02:04:33.600]  event teams that are basically federalized they dial into your cell
[02:04:33.600 --> 02:04:36.960]  phone location they can dial in at one button and listen to what you're doing
[02:04:36.960 --> 02:04:40.200]  in fact the governor of Wisconsin shot his mouth off like eight years ago and
[02:04:40.200 --> 02:04:43.280]  admitted it all in a press conference they all freaked out but stay there I
[02:04:43.280 --> 02:04:47.520]  want to come back and get your take on this and where it's going and any ideas
[02:04:47.520 --> 02:04:51.120]  about these feds because they've really vetted these feds do whatever they're
[02:04:51.120 --> 02:04:55.120]  told but still most of the feds I talked to are one of our best sources they
[02:04:55.120 --> 02:04:57.920]  don't like what's going on either so we're gonna get your take on that

[02:06:04.360 --> 02:06:08.800]  farmers Americans are losing access not just a raw milk and homemade cheeses but
[02:06:08.800 --> 02:06:12.360]  to healthy home-crafted sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut yogurt
[02:06:12.360 --> 02:06:16.080]  and kefir it seems there's a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes and
[02:06:16.080 --> 02:06:19.640]  healthy bacteria but frankly I'm not sure what the food police are so afraid of

[02:06:22.760 --> 02:06:25.920]  archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found across
[02:06:25.920 --> 02:06:30.240]  the globe in almost every culture even today Japanese eat miso Africans eat
[02:06:30.240 --> 02:06:34.800]  fermented porges Koreans eat kamichi and in India fermented milk is a staple for
[02:06:34.800 --> 02:06:38.520]  healthy living but here's some good news self-reliant Americans can now discover

[02:09:17.480 --> 02:09:22.040]  culture the Swiss do that the Dutch do that since when is that bad in Israel
[02:09:22.040 --> 02:09:27.680]  they do that the Mormons have done that since when is this so demonized and now
[02:09:27.680 --> 02:09:33.040]  you know this we broke this when well a state police officer sent me one
[02:09:33.040 --> 02:09:37.280]  document a federal marshal sent me the other one week apart the media for a
[02:09:37.280 --> 02:09:40.200]  week said it wasn't real and then later had to admit it was here was the
[02:09:40.200 --> 02:09:45.480]  Washington Times on it Napolitano stands by controversial report April 16 2009
[02:09:45.480 --> 02:09:50.280]  she stands by the report which lists returning veterans among terrorists risk
[02:09:50.280 --> 02:09:56.120]  in the US no they say number one now they you see it openly yes they're the
[02:09:56.120 --> 02:10:01.000]  terrorist now I've actually worried this out I've broken it down the only thing
[02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:06.840]  it could be is an attempt to wipe out the military and police and the American
[02:10:06.840 --> 02:10:11.880]  people in some type of civil war and the preparations all show that and the NLE
[02:10:11.880 --> 02:10:16.960]  national level exercises the last four years in a row publicly say they want to
[02:10:16.960 --> 02:10:21.560]  use foreign assets so we've seen this in areas of Europe under gladio we've seen
[02:10:21.560 --> 02:10:25.240]  this in the Middle East getting Shiite and Sunni to kill each other the new
[02:10:25.240 --> 02:10:29.960]  world order model is civil war and they're getting the police ready for it
[02:10:29.960 --> 02:10:34.600]  and they've been secretly for about five years saying veterans will IED you you
[02:10:34.600 --> 02:10:39.160]  will be bombed by veterans now that's been publicly admitted the Army Times
[02:10:39.160 --> 02:10:43.120]  writes yes police you will face veterans that will try to blow you up on the
[02:10:43.120 --> 02:10:47.320]  highway well only if you went and arrested their daddy and put them in a
[02:10:47.320 --> 02:10:51.880]  FEMA camp I mean you'll have to start the civil war for that to begin and and
[02:10:51.880 --> 02:10:55.680]  the last thing we want is this to happen this is what the globalist offshore
[02:10:55.680 --> 02:11:00.000]  want what did you see Ted Turner two days ago and singing in on to play the
[02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:04.080]  clip if you don't believe me he said I'm glad let me give you the exact quote he
[02:11:04.080 --> 02:11:07.280]  said I think it's good he goes I think it's fantastic well didn't say if it
[02:11:07.280 --> 02:11:11.040]  stopped he said I think it's good fantastic got really happy he goes I
[02:11:11.040 --> 02:11:14.600]  think it's fan I think it's good US troops are telling themselves that's a
[02:11:14.600 --> 02:11:20.760]  quote they hate you they want to use you and then get rid of you now they can
[02:11:20.760 --> 02:11:24.520]  give you psychological test find control freaks that's what they want going back
[02:11:24.520 --> 02:11:28.960]  to the police officer Scott is anonymous East Coast and a major you know Big 10
[02:11:28.960 --> 02:11:32.960]  City in his words recap what you were telling me get into the threat fusion
[02:11:32.960 --> 02:11:36.520]  centers you were talking about the federalization because you were saying
[02:11:36.520 --> 02:11:40.840]  I mean to repeat most the officers are awake now so they're just bringing in
[02:11:40.840 --> 02:11:46.560]  feds break that down for us it's just my personal observation we're seeing a lot
[02:11:46.560 --> 02:11:52.480]  more federal police officers in in the city you know under the guise in my
[02:11:52.480 --> 02:11:57.960]  opinion of you know doing their their undercover job we'll get a lot of calls
[02:11:57.960 --> 02:12:02.240]  of you know have all you know marks units stay out of a such-and-such area a
[02:12:02.240 --> 02:12:06.280]  lot more often now it very well could be you know that they're they're setting up
[02:12:06.280 --> 02:12:12.880]  a you know operations that they're in their scope of duty but just in the
[02:12:12.880 --> 02:12:16.720]  past few months the amount of the federal officers that we've seen a daily
[02:12:16.720 --> 02:12:25.640]  basis is is highly increased and it's just at the pulse of the department is
[02:12:25.640 --> 02:12:29.720]  there's a lot more distrust not only with the local and state governments but
[02:12:29.720 --> 02:12:34.440]  just what the federal government and and they're in that ability to take care
[02:12:34.440 --> 02:12:39.080]  of the of the population if something will just say it like Katrina would
[02:12:39.080 --> 02:12:45.800]  happen we and the burden on our shoulders to to I mean honestly in our
[02:12:45.800 --> 02:12:52.240]  city we're we're on the verge of chaos on a normal day and the cliche of the
[02:12:52.240 --> 02:12:57.920]  thin blue line between anarchy and chaos in this city is is absolutely true
[02:12:57.920 --> 02:13:03.840]  and one small tipping point of a natural disaster or a federally created
[02:13:03.840 --> 02:13:09.840]  disaster would would be absolutely overwhelming and the police in the city
[02:13:09.840 --> 02:13:16.520]  would not do anything as far as the majority fall into the rank and file of
[02:13:16.520 --> 02:13:20.240]  of anything that they wouldn't believe I mean I there would be a mass exodus to
[02:13:20.240 --> 02:13:27.880]  your homes to protect your family and so you know we're not too sure
[02:13:27.880 --> 02:13:30.960]  what they've been meant to mark the increase of the federal police if they
[02:13:30.960 --> 02:13:35.200]  would hinder our exit from the city if they would exactly well that's what
[02:13:35.200 --> 02:13:39.120]  in Katrina they wouldn't let anybody leave I mean the the the sheriff sat
[02:13:39.120 --> 02:13:42.960]  there for five days under orders while his mother had a cell phone that she
[02:13:42.960 --> 02:13:46.840]  kept charged you know had enough battery and he talked her for three days and he
[02:13:46.840 --> 02:13:49.840]  couldn't come he got there at five she was dead her phone went dead in three and
[02:13:49.840 --> 02:13:53.960]  his mother in a nursing home with two feet of water begging the sheriff and
[02:13:53.960 --> 02:13:59.720]  he took the federal orders and let his mother die I mean I'm sorry my mother's
[02:13:59.720 --> 02:14:04.200]  dying begging for help you better not get in my way and and that was what's so
[02:14:04.200 --> 02:14:07.700]  evil let me ask you this again I mean I know you're a police officer I know
[02:14:07.700 --> 02:14:10.200]  you've been given this training or read about it where they say the veterans are
[02:14:10.200 --> 02:14:13.520]  gonna attack you with IEDs that's been nationwide training for at least five
[02:14:13.520 --> 02:14:19.400]  years do you concur with my analysis that that that that that this if they do
[02:14:19.400 --> 02:14:23.560]  try to pull something and do this that it's designed to just wipe out the
[02:14:23.560 --> 02:14:27.560]  American people because it's not something that anybody's going to win
[02:14:27.560 --> 02:14:32.560]  there is no winning in this the only way you win is not having it happen but if
[02:14:32.560 --> 02:14:39.960]  they try to send the police or anybody to try to take guns I mean it is it is a
[02:14:39.960 --> 02:14:44.000]  death sentence or do you disagree with that no I absolutely agree with that and
[02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.800]  it's gonna be one of their tools that they're gonna use to have the people
[02:14:46.800 --> 02:14:52.000]  to the to each other up while they just sit back you know absolutely and on
[02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:55.840]  your your comment that you made about the veterans being vilified it wasn't
[02:14:55.840 --> 02:14:59.760]  too long after you had talked about it a several months ago I believe that we
[02:14:59.760 --> 02:15:07.000]  actually I couldn't believe the the timing we had a active shooter exercise
[02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:12.000]  at one of our local school campuses and it was just kind of hilarious not a
[02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:15.600]  one it's not really hilarious but coincidental we'll say that the active
[02:15:15.600 --> 02:15:20.160]  shooter who was being portrayed you know the the police officer who was the
[02:15:20.160 --> 02:15:25.480]  active shooter the bad guy was dressed in Desert Storm fatigue the whole nine
[02:15:25.480 --> 02:15:33.120]  yards he was dressed as a returning PTSD snap veteran unbelievable and here's
[02:15:33.120 --> 02:15:37.840]  the deal there's enough veterans on Prozac and stuff they put them on who
[02:15:37.840 --> 02:15:41.720]  then hear about these drills and see it on the TV where it'll actually make
[02:15:41.720 --> 02:15:46.400]  them think to do it some but more than that they've backed off on these some
[02:15:46.400 --> 02:15:50.000]  because it's so outrageous but I'm not joking you can pull up the AP article
[02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:54.040]  from like six years ago people got so upset in Michigan and they said well
[02:15:54.040 --> 02:15:57.560]  it's a federal mandated drill where they had guys in camo say they were
[02:15:57.560 --> 02:16:02.480]  militia killing the little kids elementary kids part of the drill you
[02:16:02.480 --> 02:16:06.040]  know drilling killing I'm not really killing him saying we are we are
[02:16:06.040 --> 02:16:11.280]  citizens against public education and and again it's just pure role-playing
[02:16:11.280 --> 02:16:18.520]  demonization but yeah no that's the drill what you saw was mild have you ever
[02:16:18.520 --> 02:16:24.640]  had FEMA come in and teach you that George Washington's bad no no we haven't
[02:16:24.640 --> 02:16:33.000]  had that yet but this you know this the city so liberal I mean and if I will
[02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:37.280]  just say that the city has incredibly close ties to the founding fathers okay
[02:16:37.280 --> 02:16:43.720]  so you're in what Philadelphia then all right well yeah I guess it is kind of
[02:16:43.720 --> 02:16:46.920]  hard to demonize founding fathers in Philadelphia they sure do it in Kansas
[02:16:46.920 --> 02:16:52.440]  City I got footage of it the cops are sitting there shaking their heads a
[02:16:52.440 --> 02:16:55.920]  little bit but it's just insane the firefighters actually started speaking
[02:16:55.920 --> 02:16:59.400]  up a little bit well anything else you'd like to add to people because again I
[02:16:59.400 --> 02:17:04.160]  don't see this working I don't see them getting the guns unless the plan is like
[02:17:04.160 --> 02:17:09.280]  you said everybody chewing each other up yeah I really don't see how they're
[02:17:09.280 --> 02:17:14.800]  going unless it's some you know absolutely amazing type of you know
[02:17:14.800 --> 02:17:20.920]  door-to-door martial law situation getting the guns rounding up the guns I
[02:17:20.920 --> 02:17:25.120]  it's not I guess a stretch of the imagination to say it's possible but
[02:17:25.120 --> 02:17:30.120]  it would be incredibly hard and it would be incredibly messy well yeah if one
[02:17:30.120 --> 02:17:33.520]  percent of a hundred and seventy million got honors that's what it's up to now if
[02:17:33.520 --> 02:17:38.800]  one percent fought that's one point seven million if how many veterans are
[02:17:38.800 --> 02:17:43.960]  the thirty million in this country a lot of them are just absolutely you know
[02:17:43.960 --> 02:17:48.720]  being restrained from violence at this point if one percent of thirty million
[02:17:48.720 --> 02:17:54.760]  fight that's 300,000 I mean can anybody imagine what this is I mean this this
[02:17:54.760 --> 02:17:59.080]  that is the New World Order time bomb we've got to be smarter I forget what
[02:17:59.080 --> 02:18:02.800]  James Bond movie it is where you know he shows two fighting fish kill each other
[02:18:02.800 --> 02:18:05.760]  and then the other one opens the door and it lives you know it's like see we
[02:18:05.760 --> 02:18:09.760]  have them kill each other that's the basis of the New World Order system what
[02:18:09.760 --> 02:18:13.360]  you're taking did you hear the Ted Turner clip we played where he said quote I
[02:18:13.360 --> 02:18:19.120]  think it's good US troops are killing themselves you know it's just sick me you
[02:18:19.120 --> 02:18:22.840]  know it's just sick me to somebody like that I mean because the platform that he
[02:18:22.840 --> 02:18:26.640]  has and he has no credibility as far as I'm concerned but you're right you know
[02:18:26.640 --> 02:18:30.960]  it's just sick me but the bigger story is how is it not a national news story
[02:18:30.960 --> 02:18:35.160]  this this happened two days ago and we just learned of it and no one's covered
[02:18:35.160 --> 02:18:42.160]  it oh you're right you know it doesn't surprise me with the you know the it
[02:18:42.160 --> 02:18:46.800]  just doesn't surprise me well God bless you I just to recap because you were in
[02:18:46.800 --> 02:18:49.640]  the other segments some stations don't care that short little first five minutes
[02:18:49.640 --> 02:18:52.960]  you are saying that the people are waking up in amazing numbers of other
[02:18:52.960 --> 02:18:58.040]  police absolutely and it's nice to go to the local red box and the different
[02:18:58.040 --> 02:19:00.800]  places and to see these info war stickers all over the place and I'm
[02:19:00.800 --> 02:19:04.720]  seeing a lot more of them so Alice continue your work God bless you and
[02:19:04.720 --> 02:19:09.280]  hope you keep yourself and your family safe thank you yeah and again I'm all
[02:19:09.280 --> 02:19:12.760]  in with my family the only way we're making it as we defeat these people a
[02:19:12.760 --> 02:19:17.560]  lot of people say man aren't you worried you know what I believe in God and
[02:19:17.560 --> 02:19:21.000]  that's really the difference between who I am and who people are that serve this
[02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:25.760]  system a lot of people serve evil because they're afraid of it I am afraid
[02:19:25.760 --> 02:19:30.520]  of giving into it and you know I will I look at my children how innocent and
[02:19:30.520 --> 02:19:35.680]  good they are and I just say God it's in your hands man but you know I certainly
[02:19:35.680 --> 02:19:39.600]  don't need some job like test I'll tell you that I'm a bad man compared to
[02:19:39.600 --> 02:19:43.040]  somebody like Joe but I know a lot of you are as well but we love God we love
[02:19:43.040 --> 02:19:46.840]  good and we have to do the right thing I mean this America's greatest test is

[02:23:14.680 --> 02:23:18.280]  grocery store only keeps a three-day supply of food on hand so if there's
[02:23:18.280 --> 02:23:22.400]  any interruption in our fragile food supply chain or even a hint of a crisis
[02:23:22.400 --> 02:23:25.880]  then the three-day supply at your local grocery store will be gobbled up by the
[02:23:25.880 --> 02:23:30.360]  mob in minutes and you and your family could be in serious trouble that's why
[02:23:30.360 --> 02:23:36.160]  my friend just created a free video at 37 items dot com that reveals the 37

[02:24:19.240 --> 02:24:23.240]  for calls because I need to get to the rest of the news and replay that clip on
[02:24:23.240 --> 02:24:27.600]  seeing in a Ted Turner saying he's glad us troops are killing themselves he
[02:24:27.600 --> 02:24:32.680]  starts to say I think it's fan I think it's good I think it's good I mean it
[02:24:32.680 --> 02:24:37.760]  just shows how sick these people are they're so it's so sick we're gonna be
[02:24:37.760 --> 02:24:43.080]  breaking that down and a lot more but right now let's go to Josh in Florida
[02:24:43.080 --> 02:24:49.840]  former Marines listening on 1340 a.m. WTA end of our great affiliates Josh you're
[02:24:49.840 --> 02:24:59.200]  on the air good speak up a little bit you're low I'm listening to you at the
[02:24:59.200 --> 02:25:01.960]  moment I'm wrapped up in what you're talking about I came into the middle of
[02:25:01.960 --> 02:25:06.240]  a conversation can you catch up a little bit well no I mean when we got the
[02:25:06.240 --> 02:25:10.320]  military openly training to confiscate guns that's in their new manual and we
[02:25:10.320 --> 02:25:15.320]  had a guest on who's in in the Army National Guard here in Texas he gave us
[02:25:15.320 --> 02:25:18.840]  all his info we documented it they're telling them preppers are gonna be the
[02:25:18.840 --> 02:25:24.880]  terrorists that they've got to round up basically I got you you know I went
[02:25:24.880 --> 02:25:29.920]  through Marine Corps training for a little bit you know everything was based
[02:25:29.920 --> 02:25:33.400]  on combat at first and you kind of get the impression you're serving that
[02:25:33.400 --> 02:25:37.720]  greater good I'm a younger guy myself so I'm kind of just not coming out of all
[02:25:37.720 --> 02:25:43.320]  of that fog but what was amazing as I keep hearing you give the information
[02:25:43.320 --> 02:25:47.360]  you give on a daily basis I connect these dots to these experiences I never
[02:25:47.360 --> 02:25:51.600]  thought I'd need to remember pretty kind of relevant past the combat situation
[02:25:51.600 --> 02:25:55.840]  but well no that's why the military and police even if they hear I'm crazy they
[02:25:55.840 --> 02:25:59.720]  two then they go no way that did happen just like he said of course I've been
[02:25:59.720 --> 02:26:03.480]  on this for look when I sort of get to sit footage by listeners of troops
[02:26:03.480 --> 02:26:07.480]  training to confiscate guns and the role players were saying I'm an American I
[02:26:07.480 --> 02:26:11.640]  have rights you can't do this in America I said man there's a takeover plan a
[02:26:11.640 --> 02:26:16.360]  foot now we're 14 15 years later since I discovered all this and it's out in the
[02:26:16.360 --> 02:26:22.520]  open now but it's it's 50 times bigger in a force continuum than it ever was
[02:26:22.520 --> 02:26:26.360]  before the point is it's now it used to be way down the road now it's right in
[02:26:26.360 --> 02:26:30.880]  my face it's right in your face and so thank God we got the jump on it but I'm
[02:26:30.880 --> 02:26:37.760]  telling you it's here well you're right about that that for me is a very good
[02:26:37.760 --> 02:26:43.600]  example of caramelization that it's taken me this long I did that training
[02:26:43.600 --> 02:26:47.160]  almost 10 years ago now I've been listening to you for maybe about five
[02:26:47.160 --> 02:26:52.280]  and again things that you talk about on a regular basis maybe would have been
[02:26:52.280 --> 02:26:55.200]  things that I experienced during training or something else that I never
[02:26:55.200 --> 02:26:58.680]  would have even thought of again had they not been discussed later on and then
[02:26:58.680 --> 02:27:02.680]  connected in some way with the things you talk about well I mean that's the
[02:27:02.680 --> 02:27:07.000]  thing just being aware and people aren't dumb in this country and God bless
[02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:10.480]  you thanks for the call they're compartmentalized they're focused on
[02:27:10.480 --> 02:27:13.800]  things that don't matter or things that do like trying to pay their power bill
[02:27:13.800 --> 02:27:18.000]  or whatever or their car bill or their kids doctor bill you know that's why
[02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:21.560]  they want to keep us all poor so that we're so busy just trying to make it you
[02:27:21.560 --> 02:27:25.080]  know the rat race that we can't focus on anything else but once you've studied
[02:27:25.080 --> 02:27:28.400]  history this stuff happens over and over again once you look at what's
[02:27:28.400 --> 02:27:32.960]  currently happening and once you just start reading officer manuals and
[02:27:32.960 --> 02:27:37.320]  things that are restricted but not classified you know that end up yeah
[02:27:37.320 --> 02:27:40.680]  I mean the army is so ham-fisted folks they put a lot of these out on their
[02:27:40.680 --> 02:27:45.040]  official websites and then reclassify them later that happens a lot where they
[02:27:45.040 --> 02:27:48.480]  reclassify something because they're like what did you do why'd you put that out
[02:27:48.480 --> 02:27:52.480]  you know because people have private servers and public servers so this
[02:27:52.480 --> 02:27:57.000]  stuff's everywhere when you've got hundreds of thousands of personnel being
[02:27:57.000 --> 02:28:01.040]  given training and things over the years this stuff's gonna get out there and
[02:28:01.040 --> 02:28:05.280]  so that's what's happened people always say well this conspiracy this big it
[02:28:05.280 --> 02:28:10.520]  would come out it has come out just the question is will we have the nerve to
[02:28:10.520 --> 02:28:15.440]  admit how bad this is let's go ahead and talk to Mike in Alabama ex-marines and
[02:28:15.440 --> 02:28:20.840]  army go ahead Mike hey Alex hey buddy former Marine to serve the year in
[02:28:20.840 --> 02:28:26.480]  Vietnam and I served another 10 years later on in the National Guard and when
[02:28:26.480 --> 02:28:30.920]  I was taking some of my political science courses in the 70s we had a video
[02:28:30.920 --> 02:28:34.400]  when they had a major senator on there one you know back then you would have
[02:28:34.400 --> 02:28:38.720]  recognized him as being a key senator and they were asking why do you pass so
[02:28:38.720 --> 02:28:43.720]  many laws you pass thousands of pages and new laws every year any kind of laugh
[02:28:43.720 --> 02:28:48.880]  and he said well it's like this the average law-abiding citizen goes to work
[02:28:48.880 --> 02:28:54.240]  goes to church paces taxes commits two to three misdemeanors a week and one to
[02:28:54.240 --> 02:28:58.360]  two felonies a month and they don't know it we keep figure we can follow
[02:28:58.360 --> 02:29:02.800]  anybody around for a week and arrest them for something and then not long ago
[02:29:02.800 --> 02:29:07.840]  John Stosso had a kind of a follow-up on that he said the average American now
[02:29:07.840 --> 02:29:12.720]  commits two to three felonies each week and you're not even aware of yeah now
[02:29:12.720 --> 02:29:17.800]  we spend all our time trying to make sure we're following every unconstitutional
[02:29:17.800 --> 02:29:21.560]  garbage law because they'll set us up and if they ever do set us up you can
[02:29:21.560 --> 02:29:26.320]  know folks it was a setup we are so clean here it is a is ridiculous and
[02:29:26.320 --> 02:29:30.040]  everything's a crime now you're absolutely right anything else you like to
[02:29:30.040 --> 02:29:36.080]  answer no that's it I mean a lot of people are waking up here now I mean my
[02:29:36.080 --> 02:29:39.080]  family I want to hear about that briefly them will go to four or five other
[02:29:39.080 --> 02:29:42.560]  callers and then to the rest of the news and Ted Turner saying he wants the
[02:29:42.560 --> 02:29:47.440]  troops to kill themselves how good it is how fantastic it is and this is again
[02:29:47.440 --> 02:29:55.120]  and the bigger story we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and
[02:29:55.120 --> 02:30:03.640]  the GCN radio network the worst drought in 50 years continues and the first six
[02:30:03.640 --> 02:30:08.320]  months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record 78% of the Midwest corn

[02:30:12.680 --> 02:30:16.760]  and wheat are all impacted raising prices the cost to feed livestock is
[02:30:16.760 --> 02:30:20.040]  forcing farmers and ranchers out of business blowing up your food prices
[02:30:20.040 --> 02:30:24.560]  the only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices
[02:30:24.560 --> 02:30:28.720]  by getting your own supply of foods for me foods direct now as the price of raw
[02:30:28.720 --> 02:30:32.400]  ingredients increases eat foods will have to raise prices to now is the time

[02:34:14.960 --> 02:34:21.440]  and I appreciate what you're doing out here have a friend who was stayed in the
[02:34:21.440 --> 02:34:26.240]  military for over 20 years and he's away from his family now and sort of has
[02:34:26.240 --> 02:34:32.560]  gone underground has me a little worried two years ago are you there yes
[02:34:32.560 --> 02:34:36.520]  sir two years ago and I never thought about some of the stuff you're saying
[02:34:36.520 --> 02:34:41.280]  that would have went on until I got a hold of your stuff but two two years
[02:34:41.280 --> 02:34:44.920]  ago driving to Springfield Illinois from Southern Illinois to go do a hospital
[02:34:44.920 --> 02:34:52.960]  visitation there was a double to triple blockade on the major interstate guys
[02:34:52.960 --> 02:34:57.440]  with navel binoculars on overpasses and they were stopping vehicles they said
[02:34:57.440 --> 02:35:03.560]  the drug stop but they searched every inch of every car they stopped taking
[02:35:03.560 --> 02:35:08.680]  guns and all kinds of stuff and my brother was part of the cleanup crew
[02:35:08.680 --> 02:35:11.520]  didn't know about that till a month later and he said hey did you you know did
[02:35:11.520 --> 02:35:14.520]  you know what was going on in interstate 55 I said no you know yeah I drove
[02:35:14.520 --> 02:35:17.960]  through it and he said how did you know about that I said you don't live around
[02:35:17.960 --> 02:35:21.960]  you know around there that round and he said I was one of the guys who was on
[02:35:21.960 --> 02:35:26.040]  a cleanup crew for that for this organization and he said it wasn't just
[02:35:26.040 --> 02:35:30.360]  about drugs and it just kind of thought back to that when I found you on the
[02:35:30.360 --> 02:35:36.480]  internet and I was even looking for you and but I and I thought I did you look
[02:35:36.480 --> 02:35:42.560]  familiar I remember you from some show I can't think of Brad Meltzer show you
[02:35:42.560 --> 02:35:46.520]  showed up on that so I recognized your face and I thought if Meltzer gives this
[02:35:46.520 --> 02:35:49.520]  guy credit than I am and then man cow I saw that thing and I thought okay this
[02:35:49.520 --> 02:35:52.640]  guy has some credibility and so some things I'm seeing out here with ex
[02:35:52.640 --> 02:35:57.440]  military friends like I said my friend going underground that that blockade on
[02:35:57.440 --> 02:36:00.920]  a major interstate where there's nothing in between Springfield and St. Louis I
[02:36:00.920 --> 02:36:07.520]  mean there's literally just cow the cow pastures and fields corn and so I'm a
[02:36:07.520 --> 02:36:10.680]  little freaked out so one of my questions is what do you tell a guy I'm not
[02:36:10.680 --> 02:36:14.720]  in I'm not in a tiny small town but I'm in a relatively big area in Southern
[02:36:14.720 --> 02:36:19.880]  Illinois what do you tell people like us I mean if I believe that Marshall State
[02:36:19.880 --> 02:36:23.560]  the martial law could happen well what they're doing is they're incrementally
[02:36:23.560 --> 02:36:27.120]  bringing us into martial law in the public schools thumbprinting to buy and
[02:36:27.120 --> 02:36:34.120]  sell parents showing IDs you know thumbprinting to get in TSA now at malls
[02:36:34.120 --> 02:36:39.520]  highways military checkpoints all over the country and they just do them to
[02:36:39.520 --> 02:36:43.120]  make sure the local cops are going to go along with it that's really to assess and
[02:36:43.120 --> 02:36:48.040]  watch everybody they do urban warfare drills delta force drills everywhere to
[02:36:48.040 --> 02:36:53.080]  acclimate people I mean really we're just being trained the globalist or
[02:36:53.080 --> 02:36:59.760]  psychologist so it's canarian Pavlovian operant conditioning and once you
[02:36:59.760 --> 02:37:03.800]  understand that again they're they're brainwashing the police the military the
[02:37:03.800 --> 02:37:09.720]  local and vocabulary you the media just to where we've all seen this so many
[02:37:09.720 --> 02:37:15.600]  times over and over and over again that we just basically get acclimated to
[02:37:15.600 --> 02:37:21.520]  accept it all and so you just explain to people the TSA is there to break your
[02:37:21.520 --> 02:37:25.400]  will and train you to be a slave and now they search people after the checkpoint
[02:37:25.400 --> 02:37:29.120]  now they take your food and test it in your water when they see you buy it you
[02:37:29.120 --> 02:37:33.000]  know at the McDonald's or Burger King or Starbucks they stay right in the line
[02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:36.440]  they do it and it's about well this makes no sense well that's the point you do
[02:37:36.440 --> 02:37:41.040]  whatever I tell you I tell you jump you ask how high is that clear scum you know
[02:37:41.040 --> 02:37:46.400]  this is the basic takeover because the globalists have said they're going to
[02:37:46.400 --> 02:37:50.760]  implode the world economy while posing as the savior in steps because they've
[02:37:50.760 --> 02:37:54.120]  learned they can get away with that because they want you poor they want
[02:37:54.120 --> 02:37:58.640]  NAFTA and GATT was meant to deindustrialize us they everything is to
[02:37:58.640 --> 02:38:05.840]  bring us into a one-world government and so sorry go ahead in Illinois I
[02:38:05.840 --> 02:38:09.760]  interact with a lot of police officers and one thing I've noticed in the last
[02:38:09.760 --> 02:38:14.440]  year to two years is that the state police are real standoffish and acting
[02:38:14.440 --> 02:38:18.640]  very funny that's my opinion you know I might get pulled over for a speeding
[02:38:18.640 --> 02:38:22.400]  ticket every once in a while cops are generally nice sometimes you get out of
[02:38:22.400 --> 02:38:25.760]  sometimes you don't but the state police are in my opinion generally acting
[02:38:25.760 --> 02:38:29.640]  very funny lately yeah no in Illinois you got some pretty serious state police
[02:38:29.640 --> 02:38:35.320]  it's all mafia run and they're the ones that are anti-gun they've really picked
[02:38:35.320 --> 02:38:40.040]  in Illinois a nasty crew and and then that's what it is I mean the state
[02:38:40.040 --> 02:38:43.760]  police in most states pretty much are federalized because the new order can't
[02:38:43.760 --> 02:38:47.880]  do this if the state police are under their control you know the state police
[02:38:47.880 --> 02:38:52.800]  years ago tried to stop unspeakable Jerry Sandusky type stuff at the Texas
[02:38:52.800 --> 02:38:56.400]  Youth Commission and the state police wouldn't stop investigating it so they
[02:38:56.400 --> 02:39:00.840]  just replaced the director of it I mean that's the problem with all this is that
[02:39:00.840 --> 02:39:05.760]  is that bad guys are in charge on top and we are in so much trouble I don't
[02:39:05.760 --> 02:39:08.600]  have words to describe it thank you for the call you know I've got to get to
[02:39:08.600 --> 02:39:11.040]  this again because I've been mentioning it and we're gonna get that Ted Turner
[02:39:11.040 --> 02:39:16.000]  clip ready because this is such a big issue and it ties into eugenics it ties
[02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:19.720]  into population reduction it ties into the massive suicide rates of the
[02:39:19.720 --> 02:39:24.920]  troops they know three four five six tours will really damage psychologically a
[02:39:24.920 --> 02:39:29.280]  lot of people then they put them on Prozac and that is a hallucinogen based
[02:39:29.280 --> 02:39:33.080]  system and then you will get some psychotic breaks which are the vast
[02:39:33.080 --> 02:39:37.200]  minority of troops I mean I can't believe they stand up to what they've been
[02:39:37.200 --> 02:39:42.280]  put through most people couldn't so I mean I really commend how much they've
[02:39:42.280 --> 02:39:46.240]  gone through and and held together this much they're gonna they're going then
[02:39:46.240 --> 02:39:50.880]  gonna demonize the veterans in general and take their rights away and that's
[02:39:50.880 --> 02:39:54.800]  the beta test okay and they're gonna flip the entire al-qaeda narrative onto
[02:39:54.800 --> 02:40:00.820]  the troops that's now happened so here is that Ted Turner clip and Paul Watson
[02:40:00.820 --> 02:40:04.840]  paused and then put some text in there pointing out some points here it is
[02:40:04.840 --> 02:40:08.840]  Ted Turner told CNN he thinks it's good that US troops are killing themselves
[02:40:08.840 --> 02:40:15.400]  Ted Turner CNN or American servicemen are dying suicide or from suicide over
[02:40:15.400 --> 02:40:20.440]  there then are dying in combat I mean that's shocking isn't it well what what
[02:40:20.440 --> 02:40:26.320]  no I think it's true I think it's good because it's so clear that that we're
[02:40:26.320 --> 02:40:31.920]  programmed and and and we're born to love and help each other not to kill
[02:40:31.920 --> 02:40:36.440]  each other destroy each other that's an aberration that's all left over from
[02:40:36.440 --> 02:40:41.320]  mom from hundreds of years ago it's time for us to start acting
[02:40:41.320 --> 02:40:47.080]  enlightened who's about to say I think it's terrific listen I mean that's
[02:40:47.080 --> 02:40:53.440]  shocking isn't it well what it what it no I think it's I think it's good after
[02:40:53.440 --> 02:40:56.120]  saying it's good that US troops are killing themselves Turner then advocates
[02:40:56.120 --> 02:41:00.960]  the role be usurped by the United Nations with the most murderous record ever
[02:41:00.960 --> 02:41:05.200]  tell me what you think America's place in the new world order should be it's
[02:41:05.200 --> 02:41:09.800]  always been seen as the global policeman but as you said before you know it's
[02:41:09.800 --> 02:41:12.800]  hard to see with all these military conflicts where the winner and loser
[02:41:12.800 --> 02:41:17.080]  lies what what should America be doing I think global policemen should be the
[02:41:17.080 --> 02:41:22.880]  United Nations US soldiers commit suicide at a rate of almost one per day is
[02:41:22.880 --> 02:41:27.400]  that really I think it's true I think it's good yeah he says it's good so is
[02:41:27.400 --> 02:41:30.760]  that really a good thing I mean truly sick and he has a link to the full clip
[02:41:30.760 --> 02:41:34.760]  on CNN site they're proud of this and the point is we're just conditioned now to
[02:41:34.760 --> 02:41:39.800]  hear that I mean it is it is beyond sick and here's Napolitano in the
[02:41:39.800 --> 02:41:45.560]  Washington Times saying yes the number one terror threat is veterans see that's
[02:41:45.560 --> 02:41:48.520]  what they think of you that's what they think of you and now they're getting
[02:41:48.520 --> 02:41:52.040]  ready to try to make the police fire departments and others take forced
[02:41:52.040 --> 02:41:57.400]  inoculations under the model states health emergency powers act they're
[02:41:57.400 --> 02:42:01.960]  back with that now starting with all the hospital workers so look out and
[02:42:01.960 --> 02:42:08.880]  realize the government is not your friend it is tyrannical that's the norm in
[02:42:08.880 --> 02:42:15.120]  most countries we've got a very nasty case of it I mean the country has cancer
[02:42:15.120 --> 02:42:19.560]  I'm not people say well don't be so negative look we're not gonna beat this
[02:42:19.560 --> 02:42:25.760]  if we're not honest about it and it's very exhausting I understand that it's
[02:42:25.760 --> 02:42:29.160]  scary for people to admit this to deal with it but I mean just look at every
[02:42:29.160 --> 02:42:32.320]  time there's a crisis or a problem the government doesn't help it makes it
[02:42:32.320 --> 02:42:36.880]  worse if it's the feds sometimes local government can do some good because it's
[02:42:36.880 --> 02:42:42.160]  local it knows the people it knows what's going on and you know it wants to
[02:42:42.160 --> 02:42:47.000]  have the status quo and prosperity the New World Order does not want prosperity
[02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:50.760]  for you they want you poor they want to shut down your economy they want a
[02:42:50.760 --> 02:42:56.160]  post-industrial world let's go to X in California X special forces to give us
[02:42:56.160 --> 02:42:59.720]  his take on all this welcome sir do you think do you think the doomsday
[02:42:59.720 --> 02:43:04.080]  preppers deserve to be rounded up and secretly arrested and well I guess
[02:43:04.080 --> 02:43:07.680]  executed according to our military source I mean they're already putting
[02:43:07.680 --> 02:43:11.760]  them on a fly list to going after them I mean well since when is it illegal to be
[02:43:11.760 --> 02:43:14.880]  a prepper and since when is the government so tyrannical and treasonous
[02:43:14.880 --> 02:43:18.160]  filled that they're openly teaching the military that the enemy is the American
[02:43:18.160 --> 02:43:25.200]  people well from our standpoint I'm one of 47 who resigned from Delta Force a few
[02:43:25.200 --> 02:43:30.600]  years back and it was due to the fact that we consider this all high treason
[02:43:30.600 --> 02:43:37.680]  all high treason and it's been implemented a lot earlier you have done
[02:43:37.680 --> 02:43:44.920]  a great job though holding it off by exposing and we we consider you the
[02:43:44.920 --> 02:43:50.960]  front lines along with us do you have anything else you'd like to add to the
[02:43:50.960 --> 02:44:00.200]  listeners yeah this is Apple actually been in implementation since 2006 what
[02:44:00.200 --> 02:44:04.160]  they don't know is that they're intentionally one of the reasons why
[02:44:04.160 --> 02:44:09.800]  we resigned we found out that they were trying to keep our military forces
[02:44:09.800 --> 02:44:15.040]  abroad so they wouldn't be home for this for this conduct that they're
[02:44:15.040 --> 02:44:20.840]  committing right now I can't go into a lot of details but you have been on the
[02:44:20.840 --> 02:44:27.720]  mark and it does it does rattle some change I was in special activities the
[02:44:27.720 --> 02:44:36.680]  business and we got wind of certain things like Petri Media Corporation we
[02:44:36.680 --> 02:44:43.040]  have we knew what they were doing they're just changing the basis it's the same
[02:44:43.040 --> 02:44:49.480]  people at the top and what is their goal from what you were able to discover
[02:44:49.480 --> 02:44:55.120]  well they've been doing this when we went down to Central America we saw the
[02:44:55.120 --> 02:45:00.000]  same things that they're doing now but they're taking a different path with us
[02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:08.920]  as they did sound down in Central America when I was over in Somalia we gave
[02:45:08.920 --> 02:45:15.800]  in the Intel they said that they were expendable and we went back in on our
[02:45:15.800 --> 02:45:23.960]  own and we tried to get as many out this this is going to be big it's going to be
[02:45:23.960 --> 02:45:31.760]  big and keeping it in peaceful manner is the best solution but if there's a way
[02:45:31.760 --> 02:45:35.920]  to keep some kind of deterrent with numbers they see enough civilians
[02:45:35.920 --> 02:45:43.120]  armed perhaps we might not be able to have to use that no one wants to fight
[02:45:43.120 --> 02:45:48.600]  their brothers and sisters military vets that are over there they were chasing
[02:45:48.600 --> 02:45:57.960]  ghosts in Afghanistan we were over there a couple years before then and later on
[02:45:57.960 --> 02:46:03.680]  we got Intel that some of the some of the Marines that were over there we worked
[02:46:03.680 --> 02:46:08.720]  a little bit with SOG and so forth they were telling us that they were looking
[02:46:08.720 --> 02:46:16.560]  for ghosts I was like well I couldn't say anything but there was no other
[02:46:16.560 --> 02:46:23.760]  reason than us looking for the resources let's say well that's it I mean it's a
[02:46:23.760 --> 02:46:27.200]  simulant you go in you kill enough innocent people they're gonna start
[02:46:27.200 --> 02:46:31.040]  fighting back you call them Al Qaeda meanwhile real Al Qaeda works for you
[02:46:31.040 --> 02:46:35.080]  that's full spectrum dominance you've got to create the conflict even have an
[02:46:35.080 --> 02:46:38.720]  excuse to be there and then I've talked to so many military people and it came
[02:46:38.720 --> 02:46:42.160]  out in the news years after I was told this they would go and say this is the
[02:46:42.160 --> 02:46:46.240]  first time we're gonna blow up this blow up this cave and they'd been there
[02:46:46.240 --> 02:46:50.760]  four times the previous year with other media blowing up the same cave just
[02:46:50.760 --> 02:46:57.920]  total theater none of it real well the UN special forces have been here for a
[02:46:57.920 --> 02:47:04.040]  while as you know they've had NATO here for a while they've been we a couple of
[02:47:04.040 --> 02:47:09.760]  us who caught up with each other years later decided to go and look for ourselves
[02:47:09.760 --> 02:47:15.200]  as well and you're right about FEMA camps there's no reason to have the
[02:47:15.200 --> 02:47:21.200]  raise of water facing in and they're actually manned and up and running we
[02:47:21.200 --> 02:47:25.360]  we've listed some like in Kansas other places they call them military police
[02:47:25.360 --> 02:47:30.000]  training facilities but they're building giant areas now we've we've
[02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:34.800]  actually talked to insiders that sent us photos videos it's in the army times
[02:47:34.800 --> 02:47:39.120]  that they've you know set up emergency centers for collapse it's called the
[02:47:39.120 --> 02:47:44.040]  emergency centers establishment act which just legally increases funding for
[02:47:44.040 --> 02:47:48.440]  what's already been built well good to hear from anything else yeah the
[02:47:48.440 --> 02:47:53.800]  information you would brought up a few times I've heard about China Japan and
[02:47:53.800 --> 02:48:00.840]  our fleet over there yes they were there in December 2008 and the Chinese were
[02:48:00.840 --> 02:48:08.240]  actually interrupting the training the flight simulations for combat and they
[02:48:08.240 --> 02:48:12.000]  were flying right over the aircraft they've been there since December 2008
[02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:16.760]  this isn't new this has been there for a while no I know but it's really building
[02:48:16.760 --> 02:48:20.360]  up you're right well listen good to hear from you very interesting information I
[02:48:20.360 --> 02:48:23.760]  know we got a bunch of other calls here let's just go to John and Ohio and
[02:48:23.760 --> 02:48:27.960]  then I'll come back and hit some nose just makes my head spin let's go ahead
[02:48:27.960 --> 02:48:32.320]  and talk to John X special forces as well in Ohio go ahead give us your take
[02:48:32.320 --> 02:48:39.560]  on all this I've been listening for a while first time calling I wanted to
[02:48:39.560 --> 02:48:44.440]  talk about you've been bringing up how they want to demonize veterans yes and
[02:48:44.440 --> 02:48:51.800]  I got a firsthand account of that it's it's true it's happening they I moved
[02:48:51.800 --> 02:48:57.600]  when I came back I moved to a small town to go to college I was getting harassed
[02:48:57.600 --> 02:49:04.480]  by the police a lot finally they they rated me on with no warrant I never saw
[02:49:04.480 --> 02:49:11.360]  warrant they were not dressed as police officers they did not show badges when
[02:49:11.360 --> 02:49:17.240]  they came in they were heavily armed machine guns guns drawn I had a gun at
[02:49:17.240 --> 02:49:23.440]  first I thought someone was breaking into my house I almost pulled it so later
[02:49:23.440 --> 02:49:29.320]  they said that that I'm lucky they didn't shoot me they confiscated my gun now
[02:49:29.320 --> 02:49:33.360]  they say I can't have a gun yeah by the way this is happening everywhere no judge
[02:49:33.360 --> 02:49:38.320]  no jury no PSD you just don't have a gun anymore I mean they just do whatever
[02:49:38.320 --> 02:49:43.720]  they want because they said so right and then and so then I contacted you know a
[02:49:43.720 --> 02:49:49.920]  lawyer and I dug into this and the lawyer comes back to me and says that

[02:55:44.360 --> 02:55:47.480]  whatever that you're the enemy and some of them buy into it most police are
[02:55:47.480 --> 02:55:51.400]  waking up because of this but you're gonna see some of the hopped up troops
[02:55:51.400 --> 02:55:54.520]  go crazy so that'll be the excuse you know I mean to be kind of like you have

[02:56:05.840 --> 02:56:09.720]  that's what authoritarianism does instead of the big corrupt globalist
[02:56:09.720 --> 02:56:15.480]  they're the problem they're the enemy they're the issue anything else so what
[02:56:15.480 --> 02:56:20.040]  else is your lawyer tell you well it took me three lawyers the first two they
[02:56:20.040 --> 02:56:26.040]  wouldn't tell me why you know that I was classified like this and I was on a
[02:56:26.040 --> 02:56:30.960]  list they wouldn't tell me that it took you know a lot of money and getting a
[02:56:30.960 --> 02:56:35.840]  big main lawyer to come in from from across the country to find this stuff out
[02:56:35.840 --> 02:56:40.640]  and then he was willing to tell me and he told me he said the police there the
[02:56:40.640 --> 02:56:45.800]  local police they're scared of you they consider you armed and dangerous well
[02:56:45.800 --> 02:56:48.720]  that's cuz the feds tell them that all day which is gonna become a self the
[02:56:48.720 --> 02:56:53.080]  filming prophecy God bless you I appreciate your call this is how they're
[02:56:53.080 --> 02:56:57.400]  gonna try to start a civil war right here harassing people but I mean it was
[02:56:57.400 --> 02:57:03.920]  the same thing after Vietnam and other wars that is so accurate what well I
[02:57:03.920 --> 02:57:11.360]  guess you know the writer of the the movie first blood a
[02:57:11.360 --> 02:57:16.080]  Sylvester Stallone he wrote that I mean that that's that's that story of the
[02:57:16.080 --> 02:57:19.600]  special forces guy walking through the town and the and the and the police she
[02:57:19.600 --> 02:57:22.360]  says let me take you to the end of town once you get out of here I mean that's
[02:57:22.360 --> 02:57:26.400]  exactly the type of stuff goes on see it's all how much they love the troops
[02:57:26.400 --> 02:57:32.160]  but then they're all a bunch of cowards those type of people they they hate you
[02:57:32.160 --> 02:57:35.840]  cuz they're all into authority and power and dominating people bad cops and
[02:57:35.840 --> 02:57:39.040]  so the feds are gonna come in and teach them yeah the military the veterans
[02:57:39.040 --> 02:57:42.800]  they're bad because they're scared of you they are and it's pathetic it's
[02:57:42.800 --> 02:57:46.800]  absolutely pathetic you know you send people off for these big illegal wars
[02:57:46.800 --> 02:57:50.520]  they kill a bunch of people and then you're scared of them and then it's
[02:57:50.520 --> 02:57:54.040]  gonna become a self-fulfilling prophecy messing with them we're gonna end up
[02:57:54.040 --> 02:57:58.480]  having to fight them by the way Jesse Ventura called me during the last
