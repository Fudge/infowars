[00:00:04.861 --> 00:00:09.687]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.687 --> 00:00:11.289]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:12.831]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.831 --> 00:00:17.016]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.016 --> 00:00:21.101]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.822 --> 00:00:45.064]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this Thursday, the 25th day of October 2012.
[00:00:45.064 --> 00:00:56.126]  We have Soldier X, or I guess Captain X I could call him, we have Soldier X joining us coming up in about 30 minutes.
[00:00:56.126 --> 00:01:05.728]  We have his military ID card, we have his documents, we checked into this, Rob Dude did the big interview yesterday on the Nightly News, InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:06.804 --> 00:01:09.845]  National Guard whistleblower in Texas.
[00:01:09.845 --> 00:01:14.547]  Doomsday preppers will be targeted as terrorists.
[00:01:14.547 --> 00:01:21.989]  And then Melissa Melton goes through in a big list of documents where this is actually backed up in mainstream media as well.
[00:01:21.989 --> 00:01:28.832]  You know the government demonizes preppers, constitutionalist gun owners, libertarians, conservatives, and number one, returning veterans.
[00:01:30.438 --> 00:01:38.103]  Because they know that returning veterans know the truth of what's going on, and they've done actuary breakdowns knowing most of them aren't patriots.
[00:01:38.103 --> 00:01:47.708]  You see, it's this paradox of the troops are good on average, the police are even good on average from my research, but the leadership is corrupt.
[00:01:47.708 --> 00:01:52.551]  So we're going to be breaking that down today, and Paul Watson sent me the raw video this morning.
[00:01:52.551 --> 00:01:56.774]  He's done some clips of it with text we're going to be playing.
[00:01:58.382 --> 00:01:59.923]  I know Ted Turner's a monster.
[00:01:59.923 --> 00:02:06.848]  In fact, I remember him on C-SPAN back in the mid-90s saying that, you know, the general public are useless eaters.
[00:02:06.848 --> 00:02:07.469]  Useless eaters.
[00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.211]  That's a Hitler quote he was re-issuing.
[00:02:11.211 --> 00:02:14.274]  And he said we should reduce the world population by 90 percent.
[00:02:14.274 --> 00:02:20.158]  And that was also picked up by Autobond magazine as a quote from him.
[00:02:20.158 --> 00:02:25.061]  So the point is, he's a guy who has five kids, the biggest landowner in the U.S., dozens of aircraft.
[00:02:25.061 --> 00:02:25.482]  I mean, you know.
[00:02:26.411 --> 00:02:28.052]  On record a giant consumer.
[00:02:28.052 --> 00:02:29.953]  He says you should only have one kid.
[00:02:29.953 --> 00:02:31.593]  He's got five.
[00:02:31.593 --> 00:02:32.894]  Five children.
[00:02:32.894 --> 00:02:35.835]  So more power to you, brother.
[00:02:35.835 --> 00:02:38.076]  Don't criticize me for having three, you punk.
[00:02:39.212 --> 00:02:47.598]  You simpering globalist who... Guys, will you print me the ABC News article, Secret Meeting of Billionaires to Discuss Population?
[00:02:47.598 --> 00:02:49.159]  It's also in the Guardian.
[00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:54.263]  ABC and Guardian have a similar headline, but Billionaires Meet in Secret to Discuss Population.
[00:02:54.263 --> 00:02:59.307]  And they said, yeah, we're setting up our own little private global government, you know, to reduce your numbers.
[00:03:00.495 --> 00:03:09.562]  And so many yuppies and people go, good, there are too many people at the grocery store on the hike and bike trail, or, yeah, moron, you're being targeted too, you idiot.
[00:03:09.562 --> 00:03:15.166]  Stop playing like you're, you know, up there with the elites because you agree with this.
[00:03:15.166 --> 00:03:17.868]  You're just agreeing to be smashed, flattered, and pancake yourself.
[00:03:19.684 --> 00:03:21.826]  But it's this fantasy they have.
[00:03:21.826 --> 00:03:26.489]  I mean, it's standard with trendy, quote, liberal yuppies that they're not really liberal trendies.
[00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.992]  They are vicious, know-it-all control freaks who want to reduce population.
[00:03:30.992 --> 00:03:33.354]  So this is breaking here.
[00:03:33.354 --> 00:03:39.038]  He said this several nights ago, what, two nights ago on Piers Morgan.
[00:03:39.038 --> 00:03:44.703]  And it's so mainstream now to say, Ted Turner, I think it's good U.S.
[00:03:44.703 --> 00:03:45.723]  troops are killing themselves.
[00:03:45.723 --> 00:03:46.444]  That's the bombshell.
[00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.161]  Ted Turner, I think it's good U.S.
[00:03:49.161 --> 00:03:51.741]  troops are killing themselves.
[00:03:51.741 --> 00:04:07.407]  That is so bombshell, and he said it on a show with, well, Nielsen says a million ratings, a million viewers, but you know Nielsen, they've been caught fudging stuff for MSNBC, CNN, and others.
[00:04:07.407 --> 00:04:14.129]  But I mean, still, it's seen overseas by a lot, but domestic audience of maybe 500,000, the best we can tell.
[00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:15.290]  Still, that's 500,000 people.
[00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:30.659]  I'll guarantee you, back when I was on one radio station 17 years ago, and we probably had, you know, 40,000 listeners at any one time every 15 minutes, hundreds of thousands listened to it off and on, and I had an audience of a couple hundred thousand people.
[00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:34.722]  It was rated number two at night in all of radio at one point.
[00:04:34.722 --> 00:04:35.843]  That's even up against music.
[00:04:35.843 --> 00:04:39.326]  My point is, if I went on the air and said in front of 500,000 people back then,
[00:04:41.147 --> 00:04:44.310]  That, uh, you know, I'm glad the troops are committing suicide.
[00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.332]  Folks, I would be beat up by the time I got in my car.
[00:04:47.332 --> 00:04:50.956]  I would be fired within hours.
[00:04:50.956 --> 00:04:54.459]  But he goes on CNN and says it, and everybody agrees with him.
[00:04:54.459 --> 00:04:55.279]  That's coming up.
[00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:56.841]  It's good the troops are committing suicide.
[00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:06.575]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[00:05:06.575 --> 00:05:09.178]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[00:05:09.178 --> 00:05:14.563]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[00:05:14.563 --> 00:05:19.248]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[00:05:19.528 --> 00:05:27.170]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from eFoods Direct now.
[00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:31.031]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[00:05:31.031 --> 00:05:32.811]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[00:05:32.811 --> 00:05:36.852]  I recently increased my supply from eFoods Direct because we've all known this was coming.
[00:05:36.852 --> 00:05:39.453]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.
[00:05:39.753 --> 00:05:42.536]  The fact is, you can eat it any time to save money today.
[00:05:42.536 --> 00:05:47.080]  And because it's stored for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food costs.
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.741]  Don't wait!
[00:05:47.741 --> 00:05:49.643]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:05:49.643 --> 00:05:51.225]  Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:05:51.225 --> 00:05:52.726]  You can bet your life on eFoodsDirect.
[00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:01.070]  Aaron Fullin here.
[00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:12.676]  As the Food Police shut down food co-ops, the Amish, and small farmers, Americans are losing access, not just to raw milk and homemade cheeses, but to healthy, home-crafted sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut, yogurt, and kefir.
[00:06:12.676 --> 00:06:16.718]  It seems there's a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria.
[00:06:16.718 --> 00:06:19.480]  But frankly, I'm not sure what the Food Police are so afraid of.
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:27.124]  These remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history, with archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found across the globe in almost every culture.
[00:06:27.364 --> 00:06:35.173]  Even today, Japanese eat miso, Africans eat fermented porridges, Koreans eat kimchi, and in India, fermented milk is a staple for healthy living.
[00:06:35.173 --> 00:06:36.314]  But here's some good news.
[00:06:36.314 --> 00:06:42.161]  Self-reliant Americans can now discover the secrets to making these amazing fermented foods legally and privately in their own homes.
[00:06:42.501 --> 00:06:45.844]  Since it's still legal to make these foods as long as you can make them yourself.
[00:06:45.844 --> 00:06:48.687]  For more information check out fermentationfactor.com.
[00:06:48.687 --> 00:06:50.709]  That's fermentationfactor.com.

[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:11.227]  The Silver Lungs Generator is the only all-encompassing professional class product for producing endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions right from the convenience of your home.
[00:07:11.227 --> 00:07:21.454]  With recent regulations threatening the sale of silver-based supplements, now you can secure yourself and your family by producing your own silver solutions anywhere, anytime.
[00:07:22.395 --> 00:07:29.940]  You can have the peace of mind knowing that you can create endless supply of silver anytime, anywhere, for any application.
[00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:37.145]  The Silver Lungs Generator is a one-time purchase that requires no maintenance nor replacement parts for the life of the unit.
[00:07:37.145 --> 00:07:41.929]  This product was designed to be an invaluable part of your vital preparations.
[00:07:41.929 --> 00:07:49.254]  For a detailed report on the differences between ionic silver, colloidal silver, and what most silver solution manufacturers are producing,

[00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:09.995]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:18.678 --> 00:08:38.868]  Ladies and gentlemen, Ted Turner, two nights ago on CNN said he is, quote, glad and that it's good and began to say that it was basically fantastic that US troops are committing suicide.
[00:08:38.868 --> 00:08:44.471]  Last time I checked, something like 10 times World War II levels.
[00:08:45.813 --> 00:08:48.036]  It's an all-time record.
[00:08:48.036 --> 00:08:51.521]  You can pull up the numbers yourself, but you've seen the news.
[00:08:51.521 --> 00:08:54.366]  It is just off the chart.
[00:08:54.366 --> 00:08:58.332]  Ted Turner, I think it's quote, good US troops are killing themselves.
[00:08:59.304 --> 00:09:00.785]  And he said he thinks the U.N.
[00:09:00.785 --> 00:09:05.646]  should have a world government, a New World Order, and that we should be disarmed.
[00:09:05.646 --> 00:09:06.346]  And that the U.N.
[00:09:06.346 --> 00:09:08.247]  should be the world policeman.
[00:09:08.247 --> 00:09:18.531]  Watson sent me the full clip from CNN's site, and I sat there with my mouth hanging open for 10 minutes watching the exchange.
[00:09:18.531 --> 00:09:21.972]  He's got links to that in his article up at Infowars.com if you just tuned in.
[00:09:21.972 --> 00:09:24.192]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:09:24.192 --> 00:09:28.114]  And I am anti-globalist, anti-New World Order, because, well,
[00:09:29.159 --> 00:09:33.080]  I have the Wall Street Journal here in my hand.
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:37.200]  Billionaires try to shrink world's population, report says.
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.321]  And they got caught meeting in a secret meeting.
[00:09:40.321 --> 00:09:42.741]  In fact, guys, it's this article in the Times of London right here.
[00:09:42.741 --> 00:09:43.962]  That's the one I really want.
[00:09:43.962 --> 00:09:45.782]  That link there in the article.
[00:09:45.782 --> 00:09:48.182]  A billionaire club in bid to curb world population.
[00:09:48.182 --> 00:09:53.563]  And they said, we want a world government to forcibly reduce population by 90%.
[00:09:53.563 --> 00:09:54.163]  And you know what?
[00:09:54.163 --> 00:09:57.464]  I happen to know they're spraying aluminum dioxide on the West.
[00:09:58.752 --> 00:10:02.995]  I happen to know they've been caught putting sterilants in vaccines.
[00:10:02.995 --> 00:10:05.817]  I happen to know that they write books bragging.
[00:10:05.817 --> 00:10:07.338]  In fact, you know what, I keep forgetting.
[00:10:07.338 --> 00:10:08.679]  Will somebody run in front of the cameras?
[00:10:08.679 --> 00:10:09.099]  It's okay.
[00:10:09.099 --> 00:10:12.142]  Give me that Ecoscience by John P. Holdren there in my stack.
[00:10:12.142 --> 00:10:14.984]  I don't want to just keep saying, hey, it's in John P. Holdren's book.
[00:10:14.984 --> 00:10:21.969]  You can just type in John P. Holdren put sterilants in water and you'll pull up the entire book scanned online.
[00:10:22.869 --> 00:10:27.013]  And you'll pull up him saying stuff like that on C-SPAN and admitting they're chemtrailing us.
[00:10:27.013 --> 00:10:28.815]  They call it geoengineering.
[00:10:28.815 --> 00:10:38.364]  You know, I just tend to think it's a big deal when the world's ultra-rich have Hitler quotes like Ted Turner back in the mid-90s on C-SPAN again.
[00:10:38.364 --> 00:10:43.248]  And it was quoted in Audubon Magazine saying, there's too many useless eaters in the world.
[00:10:43.248 --> 00:10:44.329]  We need to reduce their numbers by 90%.
[00:10:45.785 --> 00:10:48.768]  And he's quoted many other magazines and publications saying similar things.
[00:10:48.768 --> 00:10:51.271]  So has Prince Philip, so has Prince Charles.
[00:10:51.271 --> 00:10:54.374]  And then you see, it's not just old eccentrics saying that.
[00:10:54.374 --> 00:10:56.537]  They're doing it.
[00:10:56.537 --> 00:11:00.922]  And so, see, here's Ecoscience, and I have it all referenced out.
[00:11:00.922 --> 00:11:04.125]  We did a two-hour interview last year with Tarpley.
[00:11:05.109 --> 00:11:12.915]  And posted it at PrisonPlanet.tv where he went through the entire book with us, Dr. Tarpley, who's an expert on eugenics and their whole worldview.
[00:11:12.915 --> 00:11:16.718]  So, I think you might want to be a little concerned about this.
[00:11:16.718 --> 00:11:21.341]  Here it is, Ted Turner, I think it's good, US troops are killing themselves.
[00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:25.751]  CNN founder advocates UN taking role as global policeman.
[00:11:25.751 --> 00:11:27.151]  So we're going to get to that in a moment.
[00:11:27.151 --> 00:11:34.033]  And then National Guard whistleblower, and we've confirmed this, Doomsday Preppers will be treated as terrorist.
[00:11:34.033 --> 00:11:49.557]  And not only do we have his testimony and his ID card, and we made some contacts to confirm he's in the National Guard currently, I have a giant stack here of research
[00:11:51.089 --> 00:11:56.881]  Yeah guys, we probably don't want his documents and IDs and stuff in my document dump.
[00:11:56.881 --> 00:11:59.266]  You guys take this out of the studio just so it doesn't get caught on camera.
[00:12:00.475 --> 00:12:01.596]  Thank you.
[00:12:01.596 --> 00:12:05.538]  Somebody stuck his details inside my document pouch.
[00:12:05.538 --> 00:12:06.698]  Thank you.
[00:12:06.698 --> 00:12:10.821]  Anyways, everything he says is actually reverse engineered.
[00:12:10.821 --> 00:12:13.302]  We're able to find it in mainstream news in pieces.
[00:12:13.302 --> 00:12:14.483]  So it's all confirmed.
[00:12:14.483 --> 00:12:21.586]  They are training the military, I've known this for a long time, to come to your house and take all your food and guns and blow your head off.
[00:12:21.586 --> 00:12:22.487]  You're just going to be killed.
[00:12:22.487 --> 00:12:23.768]  You're going to be put in a ditch.
[00:12:23.768 --> 00:12:27.109]  I video Marines training for this in Police State 2000.
[00:12:28.844 --> 00:12:32.105]  Where they interrogate people and say, well, you know, what militia are you part of?
[00:12:32.105 --> 00:12:33.085]  Where'd you get your guns?
[00:12:33.085 --> 00:12:34.365]  Well, I'm from San Francisco.
[00:12:34.365 --> 00:12:41.567]  And then the Marine Corps colonel runs in and says he's not supposed to be in here, even though I've been invited to cover the drills in Oakland.
[00:12:41.567 --> 00:12:46.668]  And then I just sent in people as local observers when they had separate media events.
[00:12:46.668 --> 00:12:49.429]  They let the media in for one thing and then let the, quote, locals in.
[00:12:49.429 --> 00:12:52.590]  So I just sent people in as locals.
[00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:56.971]  And they got the Marines bringing out a militia member, putting him on his knees.
[00:12:57.631 --> 00:12:58.431]  This is in Police Day 2000.
[00:12:58.431 --> 00:12:59.352]  It's online.
[00:12:59.352 --> 00:13:00.352]  It's free.
[00:13:00.352 --> 00:13:01.593]  And shooting him.
[00:13:01.593 --> 00:13:06.735]  And the Marine says, get ready to watch this execution.
[00:13:06.735 --> 00:13:10.197]  I mean, what do you think the Army and Marines do in Afghanistan?
[00:13:10.197 --> 00:13:12.218]  That's even been on Fox News, but they defend it.
[00:13:12.218 --> 00:13:15.139]  They go in villages and kill everybody.
[00:13:17.449 --> 00:13:18.849]  Remember that was first in the Ithaca Journal.
[00:13:18.849 --> 00:13:20.770]  They had a private Gruckheimer.
[00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:21.830]  It was like seven years ago.
[00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:24.411]  And he goes, yeah, you know, we're really defeating the enemy.
[00:13:24.411 --> 00:13:27.232]  We go in villages sometimes and kill everybody, including the children.
[00:13:27.232 --> 00:13:32.194]  And the Fox News had a general come on and say, well, that's only in certain extremist villages.
[00:13:32.194 --> 00:13:37.055]  You know, that's why they'll bomb a wedding and kill 200 people to kill, quote, one bad guy.
[00:13:37.055 --> 00:13:39.676]  Well, they don't just do that for them over there.
[00:13:39.676 --> 00:13:41.736]  They're going to do that here.
[00:13:41.736 --> 00:13:44.397]  At least if they get the military to do it.
[00:13:44.397 --> 00:13:46.298]  And who do they train them the number one enemy is?
[00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:50.381]  They train and the number one enemy is the American people.
[00:13:50.381 --> 00:13:53.122]  Gun owners, conservatives, libertarians, training veterans.
[00:13:53.122 --> 00:13:54.522]  And now preppers.
[00:13:54.522 --> 00:13:56.503]  And what happened in New Orleans?
[00:13:56.503 --> 00:13:59.384]  They wouldn't let people walk out on the highways that were high and dry.
[00:13:59.384 --> 00:14:02.224]  They wouldn't let the fire departments and police departments or Walmart and the
[00:14:06.366 --> 00:14:13.152]  FEMA blocked everybody from coming in and helping, including the Coast Guard, who could get the power back on, had big ships with giant generators.
[00:14:13.152 --> 00:14:14.453]  They blocked them.
[00:14:14.453 --> 00:14:34.569]  And for, what, six, seven days, I mean, everybody go to the Superdome, and then the police stood back with the National Guard and wouldn't give people food or water as it was stockpiled, let the rapes go on, and giant flatbed trucks backed up with armored vehicles drove into the richest areas of New Orleans and surrounding areas, went in, blew safe doors off, looted and robbed, and took all the guns on video.
[00:14:36.047 --> 00:14:37.028]  On video.
[00:14:37.028 --> 00:14:38.770]  And people say, man, that was incredible they did that.
[00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:39.431]  No, no, no, no.
[00:14:39.431 --> 00:14:43.034]  They were ordered to.
[00:14:43.034 --> 00:14:43.395]  And there it is.
[00:14:43.395 --> 00:14:46.298]  New Orleans begins confiscating firearms as water recedes.
[00:14:46.298 --> 00:14:48.600]  What is that, Associated Press?
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:49.601]  Oh, New York Times.
[00:14:49.601 --> 00:14:51.483]  There you go.
[00:14:51.483 --> 00:14:54.006]  And remember, the police chief said, all the guns will be taken.
[00:14:54.006 --> 00:14:55.227]  No one will be allowed to be armed.
[00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:59.013]  But they didn't go into the crime-ridden areas and defend people being attacked.
[00:14:59.013 --> 00:14:59.473]  No, no.
[00:14:59.473 --> 00:15:04.797]  They went into some of the wealthiest neighborhoods in the country, or in New Orleans.
[00:15:04.797 --> 00:15:07.479]  You know, houses that look like the White House, that same architecture.
[00:15:07.479 --> 00:15:09.461]  Things that are in architecture books I own.
[00:15:09.461 --> 00:15:11.863]  I mean, I recognize them on the news.
[00:15:11.863 --> 00:15:14.525]  They went into homes, some of them worth $15 million.
[00:15:14.525 --> 00:15:18.548]  They went into houses with generators, lights, the owners, and they put them in handcuffs.
[00:15:19.269 --> 00:15:21.030]  And if they resisted, they beat them up or killed them.
[00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:22.570]  There was deaths.
[00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:24.131]  And they took their guns.
[00:15:24.131 --> 00:15:25.051]  On the news!
[00:15:25.051 --> 00:15:26.812]  And they have the army officer.
[00:15:26.812 --> 00:15:29.853]  I've played it probably 50 times here.
[00:15:29.853 --> 00:15:32.393]  The ABC reporter goes, you kill Americans.
[00:15:32.393 --> 00:15:35.894]  He goes, yeah, I kill Americans.
[00:15:35.894 --> 00:15:37.235]  I go in their house and I kill them.
[00:15:39.697 --> 00:15:42.059]  I mean, you know what?
[00:15:42.059 --> 00:15:54.530]  We're coming to punch you in the face, and take you, and your dogs are going to starve, and we're going to throw you in the back of a flatbed, and we're going to take you to the Superdome, where you can be gang-raped.
[00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:55.190]  How's that sound?
[00:16:05.639 --> 00:16:07.980]  And again, this is truth what I'm saying.
[00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:09.161]  This is the reality.
[00:16:09.161 --> 00:16:10.941]  So, here it is.
[00:16:10.941 --> 00:16:20.405]  National Guard whistleblower, Doomsday Preppers, will be targeted as terrorist.
[00:16:20.405 --> 00:16:21.686]  As terrorist.
[00:16:25.211 --> 00:16:34.459]  And Melissa Melton then breaks down all the links that I have here where it's admitted in the news, you know, they're putting them on the fly list, they're targeting, they're putting them in databases.
[00:16:34.459 --> 00:16:39.963]  I mean, I've been to many public urban warfare drills where they always practice with guys in overalls with John Deere hats.
[00:16:39.963 --> 00:16:41.184]  Don't lose America!
[00:16:41.184 --> 00:16:42.906]  Don't take my farm!
[00:16:42.906 --> 00:16:44.047]  You can't take it!
[00:16:44.047 --> 00:16:46.789]  Or I'm not going with you to that camp!
[00:16:46.789 --> 00:16:51.333]  And they, attention, attention, attention, you better go with us, and then after that,
[00:16:53.996 --> 00:16:55.997]  Those that submit go to the FEMA camp.
[00:16:55.997 --> 00:17:00.801]  They also have people there begging to be in the FEMA camp to sell the trips that, well, this is something you want to be part of.
[00:17:00.801 --> 00:17:05.544]  And then they roll in the armored vehicles and the rest of it for the militias that don't leave their houses.
[00:17:05.544 --> 00:17:08.846]  And they just bulbo their houses up in the simulations.
[00:17:08.846 --> 00:17:11.889]  I mean, I've been to probably 15 of these.
[00:17:11.889 --> 00:17:14.610]  I've had listeners send me video from countless other drills.
[00:17:14.610 --> 00:17:16.051]  And it's always the same.
[00:17:16.051 --> 00:17:17.592]  They've got what was in
[00:17:19.059 --> 00:17:20.481]  Hebron, Maryland, we got video.
[00:17:20.481 --> 00:17:25.766]  That was many years ago, but just a few years ago at some police aid for the rise of FEMA.
[00:17:25.766 --> 00:17:27.368]  We have the colonel on the show.
[00:17:27.368 --> 00:17:31.552]  We got him on there in Arcadia, Iowa.
[00:17:31.552 --> 00:17:34.455]  And they had the gun shop play the part of the terrorists.
[00:17:34.455 --> 00:17:35.376]  And they went and confiscated that.
[00:17:35.376 --> 00:17:36.477]  And then they went door to door.
[00:17:36.477 --> 00:17:40.502]  And it was in the newspaper how compliant everyone was for the gun confiscation drill.
[00:17:41.556 --> 00:17:45.177]  And then they went door-to-door practicing taking the guns in America.
[00:17:45.177 --> 00:17:50.159]  And they again had the Boy Scouts there going and reporting, yeah, my dad's got a gun.
[00:17:50.159 --> 00:17:54.321]  And we have this on tape from Hebron, Maryland.
[00:17:54.321 --> 00:17:57.742]  Boy Scouts with the Marines coming in and sandwiching their house.
[00:17:58.402 --> 00:18:02.405]  And helping report to their parents, such as you cannot make up the magnitude.
[00:18:02.405 --> 00:18:05.107]  People said, those can't be Boy Scouts, that's impossible.
[00:18:05.107 --> 00:18:06.128]  That must be fake.
[00:18:06.128 --> 00:18:16.476]  And now, we have the New York Times from what, three, four years ago, how the Explorer Scouts are training to do door-to-door and quote, take out disgruntled Iraqi war veterans.
[00:18:16.476 --> 00:18:21.359]  Headline, New York Times, Scouts trained to fight terrorists and more.
[00:18:21.359 --> 00:18:24.141]  People laughed and said, oh yeah, 14-year-olds bringing on.
[00:18:24.141 --> 00:18:25.462]  Those 14-year-olds are 18 now.
[00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:34.292]  Anybody who knows the history of warfare knows actually 14-year-olds are about the best it gets because they're not afraid to die for whatever reason.
[00:18:34.292 --> 00:18:35.452]  They get excited.
[00:18:35.452 --> 00:18:37.133]  They're designed for war.
[00:18:37.133 --> 00:18:40.754]  Humans are designed for combat, ladies and gentlemen, designed to defend our tribes.
[00:18:40.754 --> 00:18:45.175]  They're designed at 13, 14 to want to go with the older warriors and fight.
[00:18:45.175 --> 00:18:46.716]  That's how it works.
[00:18:46.716 --> 00:18:48.976]  They arrest our development falsely.
[00:18:48.976 --> 00:18:55.378]  And the point is, they've got them, they've got them ready, and they've been training since they're 13, 14 to come to your house and take your guns.
[00:18:55.378 --> 00:18:57.119]  People go, how dare you attack the Boy Scouts?
[00:18:57.939 --> 00:18:59.160]  I'm not attacking the Boy Scouts.
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:01.102]  I'm saying this is a fact.
[00:19:01.102 --> 00:19:03.423]  The Boy Scouts trained to take your guns.
[00:19:03.423 --> 00:19:04.744]  The Boy Scouts trained to take your guns.
[00:19:04.744 --> 00:19:05.645]  Let me say that again.
[00:19:05.645 --> 00:19:07.546]  The Boy Scouts trained to take your guns.
[00:19:07.546 --> 00:19:08.587]  I've got video.
[00:19:08.587 --> 00:19:09.788]  I've got kernels.
[00:19:09.788 --> 00:19:11.029]  I've got news articles.
[00:19:11.029 --> 00:19:12.890]  I've got photos in the New York Times.
[00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:15.212]  I got it in triplicate.
[00:19:15.212 --> 00:19:21.537]  People thought I was a space alien in 1998 when we got that Hebron, Maryland footage that our listeners went and shot.
[00:19:22.782 --> 00:19:24.923]  And they sent me hours and hours of it.
[00:19:24.923 --> 00:19:26.284]  We ought to put all that stuff online.
[00:19:26.284 --> 00:19:28.726]  I just used like 15 minutes of it in Police State 2000.
[00:19:28.726 --> 00:19:30.907]  Just the highlights of it.
[00:19:30.907 --> 00:19:37.071]  I mean, it's got Marines walking over with machine guns saying, turn your cameras off, you're not allowed to film.
[00:19:37.071 --> 00:19:42.394]  The police come and grab their stuff, but still thought it might be American, gave them the footage back, so we got it.
[00:19:42.394 --> 00:19:43.075]  We're talking about
[00:19:44.218 --> 00:19:48.720]  Marines with heavy machine guns walking up saying, you're gonna turn your cameras off.
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:57.563]  Well, no kidding you don't want us to see plainclothes Marines and Marines in uniform training with the local scout troop how to turn mommy and daddy in.
[00:19:57.563 --> 00:19:59.524]  I mean, if this isn't treason, I don't know what is.
[00:20:02.401 --> 00:20:07.484]  That's what it sounds like when a burglar kicks in the door of a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[00:20:07.484 --> 00:20:09.625]  Don't let your home be the next target.
[00:20:09.625 --> 00:20:13.267]  Make it look like someone is home watching television with Fake TV.
[00:20:13.267 --> 00:20:17.750]  Fake TV is a small electronic device that makes the same light as a real television.
[00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:20.872]  So from outside, it looks like someone is home watching TV.
[00:20:20.872 --> 00:20:25.474]  Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer, but is far more convincing to burglars.
[00:20:25.474 --> 00:20:31.478]  Fake TV deters burglars, costs far less than an alarm, and is highly recommended by numerous police departments.
[00:20:31.818 --> 00:20:33.719]  Use it anytime you're away from home.

[00:24:12.659 --> 00:24:16.200]  Don't want no shackles.
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:18.841]  Don't want no shackles on me.
[00:24:18.841 --> 00:24:21.981]  Neither do I, Jimmy.
[00:24:21.981 --> 00:24:23.862]  Don't want no shackles.
[00:24:23.862 --> 00:24:25.162]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:25.162 --> 00:24:26.383]  Don't want no shackles on me.
[00:24:26.383 --> 00:24:27.703]  Yeah, here's the New York Times.
[00:24:27.703 --> 00:24:31.284]  Scouts trained to fight terrorists and more.
[00:24:31.284 --> 00:24:36.525]  A disgruntled Iraq war veteran has already taken out two people.
[00:24:36.525 --> 00:24:38.045]  One slumped on a desk.
[00:24:38.045 --> 00:24:39.586]  The other covered in blood on the floor.
[00:24:40.848 --> 00:24:50.334]  Bam Bam, the responding officers, eight teenage boys and girls, the youngest 14, face trip wire, a thin cloud of poisonous gas, and loud shots.
[00:24:50.334 --> 00:24:51.795]  Bam Bam!
[00:24:51.795 --> 00:24:57.779]  And the ROTC and college, all of them, for decades they trained to fight one group, 90% of the time.
[00:24:59.471 --> 00:25:02.894]  Gun owners, veterans, and people wearing John Deere hats.
[00:25:02.894 --> 00:25:08.759]  And I've had so many troops call me over the years, going, I used to listen to you when I was 15 with my dad, and thought you were lying.
[00:25:08.759 --> 00:25:12.482]  And I joined the Army or Marines, and we went out and did drills, and guess what they were wearing?
[00:25:12.482 --> 00:25:13.623]  They were dressed like farmers.
[00:25:13.623 --> 00:25:14.944]  We're trying to do... It's true!
[00:25:14.944 --> 00:25:16.406]  My gosh, it's all true!
[00:25:16.406 --> 00:25:17.486]  Yeah, you bet it's true!
[00:25:17.486 --> 00:25:19.128]  You think I'm lying up here?
[00:25:19.128 --> 00:25:22.251]  If I'm lying, I'm dying.
[00:25:22.251 --> 00:25:23.492]  I don't believe in lying, folks.
[00:25:23.492 --> 00:25:24.633]  I believe in telling the truth.
[00:25:24.633 --> 00:25:25.934]  And people are scared of the truth.
[00:25:25.934 --> 00:25:27.115]  By the way, you want to hear some truth?
[00:25:28.993 --> 00:25:32.894]  We're going to get more into this attempted takeover, but it's outrageous.
[00:25:32.894 --> 00:25:35.455]  They won't get away with it if we just recognize it.
[00:25:35.455 --> 00:25:42.097]  But historically, really bad things have a way of happening because people can't believe it's happening.
[00:25:42.097 --> 00:25:44.918]  You've got to admit this is going on and get freaked out about it.
[00:25:44.918 --> 00:25:46.898]  People say, what do you want us to be afraid?
[00:25:46.898 --> 00:25:49.179]  No, I inherently think you're like I am.
[00:25:49.952 --> 00:25:52.794]  I started finding out about this stuff 17 years ago.
[00:25:52.794 --> 00:25:56.436]  I didn't know one-tenth of what I know then and I knew I better get involved.
[00:25:56.436 --> 00:25:57.456]  People want to enslave me.
[00:25:57.456 --> 00:25:58.657]  People want to take my guns.
[00:25:58.657 --> 00:26:00.638]  People want to get rid of the private property.
[00:26:00.638 --> 00:26:02.700]  They want to get rid of the family.
[00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:07.863]  They want to sit there and lecture me in an authoritarian way that I've got to stand down and give up my rights and I'm bad.
[00:26:07.863 --> 00:26:07.923]  No!
[00:26:07.923 --> 00:26:10.164]  I'm going to stand up against you.
[00:26:10.164 --> 00:26:11.785]  How's that sound?
[00:26:11.785 --> 00:26:13.466]  It's a basic instinct for freedom.
[00:26:14.758 --> 00:26:15.598]  And you've all got it.
[00:26:15.598 --> 00:26:16.898]  You've got to rediscover it.
[00:26:16.898 --> 00:26:26.640]  And if you don't feel an absolute burning desire to resist evil, something's wrong with you.
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:27.941]  Bondage is not funny.
[00:26:27.941 --> 00:26:28.641]  It's not cute.
[00:26:28.641 --> 00:26:31.181]  And I will not let my three children live in bondage.
[00:26:31.181 --> 00:26:35.262]  I will resist the New World Order or I'm going to die trying.
[00:26:35.262 --> 00:26:43.784]  Before people just sit around in their house loading guns up and saying, well, someday they'll come, engage in the Info War now and the tyranny will never get
[00:26:45.143 --> 00:26:49.947]  We've got the initiative right now and we've got the proof and the facts and we have simply got to point out that we've been right.
[00:27:15.250 --> 00:27:16.450]  Now let me go to this tape here.
[00:27:16.450 --> 00:27:18.451]  This is from CNN.
[00:27:18.451 --> 00:27:20.351]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[00:27:20.351 --> 00:27:23.452]  This should be one of the biggest stories in the country, but it's been out for two days.
[00:27:23.452 --> 00:27:24.752]  No one covered it.
[00:27:24.752 --> 00:27:32.054]  He said this on Piers Morgan two nights ago in front of everyone, and no one has picked this up.
[00:27:32.054 --> 00:27:34.175]  Ted Turner, I think it's good U.S.
[00:27:34.175 --> 00:27:35.655]  troops are killing themselves.
[00:27:35.655 --> 00:27:37.575]  CNN founder advocates U.N.
[00:27:37.575 --> 00:27:39.376]  take a role as global policeman.
[00:27:39.376 --> 00:27:43.757]  Here are a few of the clips with Paul Watson put text comments in between.
[00:27:43.757 --> 00:27:44.117]  Here it is.
[00:27:45.458 --> 00:27:47.527]  Ted Turner told CNN he thinks it's good that U.S.
[00:27:47.527 --> 00:27:48.351]  troops are killing themselves.
[00:27:50.026 --> 00:27:53.507]  More American servicemen are dying now.
[00:27:53.507 --> 00:27:54.328]  Suicide?
[00:27:54.328 --> 00:27:57.849]  Of some suicide over there that are dying in combat.
[00:27:57.849 --> 00:27:59.029]  That's shocking, isn't it?
[00:27:59.029 --> 00:28:13.434]  Well, no, I think it's good because it's so clear that we're programmed and we're born to love and help each other, not to kill each other, destroy each other.
[00:28:13.434 --> 00:28:14.435]  That's an abortion.
[00:28:14.435 --> 00:28:16.516]  That's left over from
[00:28:17.856 --> 00:28:24.179]  From hundreds of years ago, it's time for us to start acting, uh, enlightened.
[00:28:24.179 --> 00:28:27.441]  Was he about to say, I think it's terrific?
[00:28:27.441 --> 00:28:29.342]  You bet he was.
[00:28:29.342 --> 00:28:30.583]  That's shocking, isn't it?
[00:28:30.583 --> 00:28:34.365]  Well, what, it, it, what, it, no, I think it's, I think it's good.
[00:28:34.365 --> 00:28:36.886]  After saying it's good that U.S.
[00:28:36.886 --> 00:28:43.870]  troops are killing themselves, Turner then advocates their role being usurped by the U.N.
[00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:45.131]  Incredible.
[00:28:45.131 --> 00:28:45.591]  Incredible.
[00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:50.202]  Ted, what do you think America's place in the New World Order should be?
[00:28:50.202 --> 00:28:53.303]  It's always been seen as the global policeman.
[00:28:53.303 --> 00:28:58.486]  But as you said before, you know, it's hard to see with all these military conflicts where the winner and loser lies.
[00:28:58.486 --> 00:29:00.847]  What should America be doing globally?
[00:29:00.847 --> 00:29:04.469]  I think the global policeman should be the United Nations.
[00:29:04.469 --> 00:29:05.029]  There you go.
[00:29:05.029 --> 00:29:08.271]  UN soldiers commit suicide at a rate of almost one per day.
[00:29:08.271 --> 00:29:09.752]  US soldiers do.
[00:29:09.752 --> 00:29:10.992]  Is this really a good thing?
[00:29:10.992 --> 00:29:11.913]  Well, yeah, he says it is.
[00:29:11.913 --> 00:29:13.273]  Ted Turner.
[00:29:13.273 --> 00:29:13.954]  You heard him.
[00:29:13.954 --> 00:29:14.214]  Right here.
[00:29:16.294 --> 00:29:17.519]  No, I think it's good.
[00:29:19.048 --> 00:29:20.288]  Oh, there you go.
[00:29:20.288 --> 00:29:23.650]  He thinks it's good.
[00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:27.131]  Ted Turner, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to play that more.
[00:29:27.131 --> 00:29:32.653]  And the full unexcerpted clip is also in our article.
[00:29:32.653 --> 00:29:33.993]  Ted Turner, I think it's good.
[00:29:33.993 --> 00:29:34.253]  U.S.
[00:29:34.253 --> 00:29:36.214]  troops are killing themselves.
[00:29:36.214 --> 00:29:37.914]  CNN founder advocates U.N.
[00:29:37.914 --> 00:29:42.536]  take role as global policemen in a new world order.
[00:29:42.536 --> 00:29:45.997]  But the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center say I'm an extremist and evil.
[00:29:45.997 --> 00:29:47.318]  None of this is happening.
[00:29:47.318 --> 00:29:48.238]  None of this exists.
[00:29:49.625 --> 00:29:52.614]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.614 --> 00:29:56.226]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.166 --> 00:30:05.669]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[00:30:05.669 --> 00:30:08.090]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:17.195]  My friends, I've done a lot of research, and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure, and it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[00:30:17.195 --> 00:30:20.637]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[00:30:20.637 --> 00:30:22.318]  There's no priming required.
[00:30:22.318 --> 00:30:24.599]  It's NSF-42 certified.
[00:30:24.599 --> 00:30:27.101]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[00:30:28.161 --> 00:30:29.681]  Easy to set up and use.
[00:30:29.681 --> 00:30:31.102]  Doesn't require electricity.
[00:30:31.102 --> 00:30:34.263]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[00:30:34.263 --> 00:30:37.643]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[00:30:37.643 --> 00:30:41.785]  Save money by not buying bottled water, and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[00:30:41.785 --> 00:30:44.525]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[00:30:44.525 --> 00:30:46.106]  It's what my family uses.
[00:30:46.106 --> 00:30:49.407]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.
[00:30:49.407 --> 00:30:54.668]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at Infowars.com.
[00:30:55.248 --> 00:30:56.449]  You can also call to order.
[00:30:56.449 --> 00:30:57.810]  888-253-3139.
[00:30:57.810 --> 00:31:01.212]  Aaron Fullin here.
[00:31:01.212 --> 00:31:12.820]  As the food police shut down food co-ops, the Amish, and small farmers, Americans are losing access, not just to raw milk and homemade cheeses, but to healthy, home-crafted sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut, yogurt, and kefir.
[00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:16.643]  It seems there's a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria.
[00:31:16.843 --> 00:31:19.624]  But frankly, I'm not sure what the food police are so afraid of.
[00:31:19.624 --> 00:31:27.507]  These remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history, with archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found across the globe in almost every culture.
[00:31:27.507 --> 00:31:35.010]  Even today, Japanese eat miso, Africans eat fermented porridges, Koreans eat kimchi, and in India, fermented milk is a staple for healthy living.
[00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:36.430]  But here's some good news.
[00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:42.652]  Self-reliant Americans can now discover the secrets to making these amazing fermented foods legally and privately in their own homes.
[00:31:42.652 --> 00:31:45.973]  Since it's still legal to make these foods as long as you can make them yourself.
[00:31:45.973 --> 00:31:48.814]  For more information, check out fermentationfactor.com.
[00:31:48.814 --> 00:31:50.835]  That's fermentationfactor.com.
[00:31:50.835 --> 00:31:53.256]  It's easy to create your own powerful fermented foods.
[00:31:53.256 --> 00:31:56.957]  And you can do it by going to www.fermentationfactor.com.
[00:31:56.957 --> 00:31:59.678]  That's www.fermentationfactor.com.
[00:31:59.978 --> 00:32:06.486]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[00:32:06.486 --> 00:32:09.088]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[00:32:09.088 --> 00:32:14.134]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[00:32:14.855 --> 00:32:19.437]  To feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[00:32:19.437 --> 00:32:27.080]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from eFoods Direct now.
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:30.941]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[00:32:30.941 --> 00:32:32.482]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[00:32:32.742 --> 00:32:36.743]  I recently increased my supply from eFoodsDirect because we've all known this was coming.
[00:32:36.743 --> 00:32:39.664]  You know about their delicious, long-term, storable foods.
[00:32:39.664 --> 00:32:42.444]  The fact is, you can eat it anytime to save money today.
[00:32:42.444 --> 00:32:47.005]  And because it stores for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food costs.
[00:32:47.005 --> 00:32:47.645]  Don't wait!
[00:32:47.645 --> 00:32:49.546]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:32:49.546 --> 00:32:51.126]  Call 800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:32:51.126 --> 00:32:52.646]  You can bet your life on eFoodsDirect.
[00:33:02.469 --> 00:33:08.759]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:20.734 --> 00:33:23.836]  Don't tread on me.
[00:33:23.836 --> 00:33:33.243]  Police are taught that one of the founding flags of this republic, the Gadsden flag, liberty or death, don't tread on me, is terrorist.
[00:33:33.243 --> 00:33:40.588]  They are taught and I have video of it sent to me from Kansas City by a firefighter and a police and firefighter conference with FEMA saying the founding fathers were bad.
[00:33:41.588 --> 00:33:45.810]  We have that in their official MIAC and Homeland Security training manuals, of course.
[00:33:45.810 --> 00:33:50.653]  And it's been national news now for about three and a half years that they train to take on, quote, veterans.
[00:33:50.653 --> 00:33:52.053]  And Homeland Security said, you bet.
[00:33:52.053 --> 00:33:53.854]  Veterans are the number one terrorist.
[00:33:53.854 --> 00:33:55.555]  They're the number one enemy.
[00:33:55.555 --> 00:33:56.636]  And that's just the way it is.
[00:33:56.636 --> 00:34:01.298]  And people will soon say it's patriotic to see their veteran neighbor hauled away to a re-education center.
[00:34:01.983 --> 00:34:05.826]  And re-education centers are in the new official Army manual.
[00:34:05.826 --> 00:34:08.948]  The Army responded to us five months ago and said, yes, that's a real document.
[00:34:08.948 --> 00:34:10.189]  You're not supposed to have it.
[00:34:10.189 --> 00:34:13.051]  They even used the term re-education camp that Mao Zedong used.
[00:34:13.051 --> 00:34:15.373]  So they could use different names.
[00:34:15.373 --> 00:34:17.355]  They want this all out in the open.
[00:34:17.355 --> 00:34:18.736]  We're going to take your guns.
[00:34:18.736 --> 00:34:21.198]  We're training Ugan forces against you, youth corps.
[00:34:22.806 --> 00:34:30.191]  In fact, they just ran in here with a mainstream article about Homeland Security is running around recruiting.
[00:34:30.191 --> 00:34:31.312]  Here it is, The Hill.
[00:34:31.312 --> 00:34:32.873]  Homeland Security to recruit from U.S.
[00:34:32.873 --> 00:34:36.435]  universities, just like the CIA is and operating domestically.
[00:34:36.435 --> 00:34:41.259]  We need to figure out how to get them into DHS effectively and keep them, Napolitano told the group.
[00:34:41.259 --> 00:34:46.883]  Yeah, they're converting over the paramilitary dependents that are now going to run our lives in the collapsing economy.
[00:34:47.743 --> 00:34:51.806]  And if you think it's going to go away when Mitt Romney gets elected, go ahead and hold your breath.
[00:34:51.806 --> 00:34:54.228]  See how long that works for you.
[00:34:54.228 --> 00:34:57.530]  Not that I wish, you know, that things wouldn't just get better with the president.
[00:34:57.530 --> 00:35:00.051]  This is a globalist agenda.
[00:35:00.051 --> 00:35:03.794]  That's why Romney and Obama are so close together on the real issues.
[00:35:03.794 --> 00:35:13.140]  The rhetoric's a little different, but when their actions, man, they are two birds of a feather that certainly fly together.
[00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:13.641]  So we're going to be
[00:35:15.229 --> 00:35:19.012]  Going over all of that again, Ted Turner, I think it's good U.S.
[00:35:19.012 --> 00:35:20.112]  troops are killing themselves.
[00:35:20.112 --> 00:35:23.014]  And it's been out in the news for two days on CNN.
[00:35:23.014 --> 00:35:25.216]  No news report.
[00:35:25.216 --> 00:35:26.477]  No news report.
[00:35:26.477 --> 00:35:29.999]  And a listener sent this to Paul Watson early this morning.
[00:35:29.999 --> 00:35:30.980]  We went and looked it up.
[00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:32.161]  There it is on their website.
[00:35:32.161 --> 00:35:33.642]  They've got it posted.
[00:35:33.642 --> 00:35:37.044]  About Ted Turner, you know, talks about the New World Order, how great it is.
[00:35:37.044 --> 00:35:37.844]  But it doesn't exist.
[00:35:39.275 --> 00:35:42.818]  We're going to go to our guest here in just a moment.
[00:35:42.818 --> 00:35:48.482]  We'll just call him Soldier X, but we've got all his documents.
[00:35:48.482 --> 00:35:52.785]  He's currently in the National Guard, but National Guard whistleblower.
[00:35:52.785 --> 00:35:54.966]  Doomsday Preppers will be treated as terrorists.
[00:35:54.966 --> 00:36:00.530]  Big breaking news also at PrisonPlanet.com, Infowars.net and Infowars.com.
[00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:01.151]  Big news!
[00:36:01.151 --> 00:36:07.976]  This needs to get out to everybody because if they can just quietly demonize veterans, gun owners, libertarians, conservatives, preppers,
[00:36:09.011 --> 00:36:11.613]  Then the cops and the military will start buying into it.
[00:36:11.613 --> 00:36:15.556]  We've got to publicly... It's always a battle, pushing back and forth.
[00:36:15.556 --> 00:36:16.317]  It's continual.
[00:36:16.317 --> 00:36:17.618]  You give up, they win.
[00:36:17.618 --> 00:36:19.459]  We're starting to get the initiative.
[00:36:19.459 --> 00:36:21.841]  That's why they're getting desperate and fighting back.
[00:36:21.841 --> 00:36:23.303]  So we're in this fight.
[00:36:23.303 --> 00:36:26.865]  In fact, you know, we're like in round six here of a 12-round bout.
[00:36:26.865 --> 00:36:28.086]  We're toe-to-toe.
[00:36:28.086 --> 00:36:30.949]  We've got the initiative, but they're coming out swinging.
[00:36:30.949 --> 00:36:33.611]  And they can stage false flags, they can do anything.
[00:36:33.611 --> 00:36:37.234]  But we've got to just put the full energy in to exposing these people.
[00:36:38.442 --> 00:36:42.205]  And that means demonizing them with their actions.
[00:36:42.205 --> 00:36:46.368]  That means using the truth, the ultimate tool against tyranny.
[00:36:46.368 --> 00:36:47.629]  They've got black propaganda.
[00:36:47.629 --> 00:36:48.890]  That means lies.
[00:36:48.890 --> 00:36:51.172]  All information warfare is called propaganda.
[00:36:51.172 --> 00:36:54.935]  It doesn't even have a negative connotation in the true semantical breakdown.
[00:36:54.935 --> 00:37:00.760]  When I say, you know, that, hey, it's good to get exercise and eat organic food, that's health propaganda.
[00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:01.700]  It's true.
[00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:02.781]  It's healthy what I said.
[00:37:02.781 --> 00:37:04.402]  It comes from my heart and research.
[00:37:05.884 --> 00:37:08.226]  Because telling the truth feels so good.
[00:37:08.226 --> 00:37:09.848]  Standing up to evil feels so good.
[00:37:09.848 --> 00:37:11.310]  People say, oh thank you for telling the truth.
[00:37:11.310 --> 00:37:12.351]  Are you kidding?
[00:37:12.351 --> 00:37:16.055]  I'll die for the truth.
[00:37:16.055 --> 00:37:18.057]  That's the thing about people that serve evil.
[00:37:18.057 --> 00:37:21.060]  Once you get some petty power, I guess I'm just not like them.
[00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:25.866]  And listen, those of you out there that do love good and have it in your heart, it's time to fight.
[00:37:27.782 --> 00:37:29.183]  It's time to put that into action.
[00:37:29.183 --> 00:37:30.684]  It's time to expose these people.
[00:37:30.684 --> 00:37:32.266]  It's time to get aggressive.
[00:37:32.266 --> 00:37:35.608]  Getting us on AM and FM stations.
[00:37:35.608 --> 00:37:38.771]  Getting the magazine in bulk or giving it as a gift subscription.
[00:37:38.771 --> 00:37:40.112]  Great way to wake people up.
[00:37:40.112 --> 00:37:48.519]  Imagine 13 issues delivered to their door over and over again with incredible, you know, amazing graphics and info to get them to go in and look at the inside.
[00:37:48.519 --> 00:37:49.340]  All the factoids.
[00:37:50.735 --> 00:37:59.239]  But you yourself need to get an access show, or get a local radio show, or put out a local newsletter, or do banner hangs.
[00:37:59.239 --> 00:38:00.179]  Get aggressive.
[00:38:00.179 --> 00:38:02.040]  Get the buzz of Liberty going.
[00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:04.401]  They want to shut us down with intimidation now.
[00:38:04.401 --> 00:38:05.342]  Yeah, we're watching you.
[00:38:05.342 --> 00:38:08.563]  Yeah, we'll arrest preppers and patriots.
[00:38:08.563 --> 00:38:12.685]  They're now admitting when it was being built in secret because they want to scare everybody.
[00:38:12.685 --> 00:38:18.468]  Like, we're just going to urinate on ourselves and go, oh, okay, foreign banks, you're preparing to try to come arrest us?
[00:38:20.765 --> 00:38:22.547]  They will never be able to execute that.
[00:38:22.547 --> 00:38:23.187]  It's a bluff.
[00:38:23.187 --> 00:38:29.493]  They may be able to attack certain people that are predisposed to be demonized to try to scare everyone else to roll over.
[00:38:29.493 --> 00:38:35.479]  They thought, and it's been declassified, it came out in Congress, they'd attack some kind of weird, cultish people.
[00:38:35.479 --> 00:38:36.820]  You know, that's how the media pushed it.
[00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:39.863]  Some of it was weird, I know them, but a lot of it was lies.
[00:38:39.863 --> 00:38:40.964]  The Branch Davidians.
[00:38:40.964 --> 00:38:43.846]  They'd burn them down and kill them and set the precedent.
[00:38:43.846 --> 00:38:45.348]  That was one of the biggest awakenings ever.
[00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:50.461]  So, they don't have air superiority either in the media.
[00:38:50.461 --> 00:38:52.101]  They could shut down the web now.
[00:38:52.101 --> 00:38:55.382]  We've already hit them so hard, so savagely.
[00:38:55.382 --> 00:38:59.683]  We've already basically, in a knife fight, we've already stabbed them about 14 times.
[00:38:59.683 --> 00:39:01.664]  They got a lot of adrenaline, they're still going.
[00:39:01.664 --> 00:39:03.184]  All we gotta do is stay back.
[00:39:03.184 --> 00:39:04.685]  They haven't even hit us.
[00:39:04.685 --> 00:39:05.305]  You understand that?
[00:39:06.889 --> 00:39:09.370]  We've already stabbed them a bomb, and they're bleeding out, folks.
[00:39:09.370 --> 00:39:11.110]  They're dangerous right now.
[00:39:11.110 --> 00:39:12.710]  They got that last push of adrenaline.
[00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:23.933]  We can beat these authoritarian scum if we absolutely get in their face and absolutely, with love for our families, convert that right into stomping down the New World Order.
[00:39:23.933 --> 00:39:25.494]  You can call it hate if you want, but it's not.
[00:39:25.494 --> 00:39:26.954]  It's something different.
[00:39:26.954 --> 00:39:34.856]  It's focused rage and passion against evil because you love your families, and you can just literally, literally crush these people.
[00:39:35.782 --> 00:39:40.167]  We have the moral authority, we have God on our side, and you've got to step into that and take it in your hands.
[00:39:40.167 --> 00:39:42.690]  Now, I know our guest has got to go here soon.
[00:39:42.690 --> 00:39:44.452]  All I want to say is this.
[00:39:44.452 --> 00:39:45.873]  Be sure and support us as well.
[00:39:45.873 --> 00:39:51.279]  Get the ProPure water filters, discounted 10% with the promo code WATER, and infowarestore.com.
[00:39:51.279 --> 00:39:55.524]  That's one of the great things everybody needs, and your purchases also fund our operation.
[00:39:56.741 --> 00:40:10.368]  I guess we're terrorists saying get high quality, you know, water filters, the LifeStraw, the new video on preparedness and strategic relocation and the globalist master plan by Joel Skousen and myself.
[00:40:10.368 --> 00:40:14.290]  Strategic Relocation, the film available at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:40:14.290 --> 00:40:16.171]  That also makes our transmission possible at 888-253-3139.
[00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:31.269]  Okay, you've seen the news articles, the army manuals for gun confiscation, re-education camps, civilian inmate labor camp program, the Emergency Centers Establishment Act, all of this.
[00:40:32.779 --> 00:40:36.300]  You've seen New York Times scout trains to fight terrorists and more.
[00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:39.941]  It says right here, killing Iraq veterans that don't turn their guns in.
[00:40:39.941 --> 00:40:41.322]  That's New York Times.
[00:40:41.322 --> 00:40:42.142]  You know about this.
[00:40:42.142 --> 00:40:47.344]  You saw the AP days after we broke it here with Doug Hagman of the Northeast Intelligence Network.
[00:40:47.344 --> 00:40:51.365]  A guy with no criminal record going to visit his wife who's in the military in Okinawa.
[00:40:51.365 --> 00:40:52.766]  He's in Japan.
[00:40:52.766 --> 00:40:53.946]  And they say, you're not flying.
[00:40:53.946 --> 00:40:56.247]  They told him, you're a prepper.
[00:40:57.369 --> 00:41:01.853]  And you went to a prepper meeting, and you criticized that we sent a Fed in.
[00:41:01.853 --> 00:41:04.976]  You talked about it on the web, so you don't fly anymore.
[00:41:04.976 --> 00:41:07.257]  And then AP picked it up and admitted it.
[00:41:07.257 --> 00:41:08.439]  This is their control grid.
[00:41:08.439 --> 00:41:13.323]  Look, if you're awake and know what's going on and see the tyranny, and you don't want to be dependent, you're the enemy.
[00:41:13.323 --> 00:41:19.108]  If you want an Obama phone, if you want your welfare check, if you want your food stamps, you're what the globalists want.
[00:41:19.628 --> 00:41:21.269]  This is a takedown of the economy.
[00:41:21.269 --> 00:41:26.253]  Agenda 21, while they're shutting down the Amish, the lemonade stands, the backyard gardens.
[00:41:26.253 --> 00:41:28.034]  It's happening.
[00:41:28.034 --> 00:41:30.456]  The Soviets took over Ukraine like this.
[00:41:30.456 --> 00:41:31.156]  Poland.
[00:41:31.156 --> 00:41:33.939]  They know what the communist Chinese did this.
[00:41:34.699 --> 00:41:37.102]  And the Cultural Revolution Great Leap Forward.
[00:41:37.102 --> 00:41:38.304]  This is their program.
[00:41:38.304 --> 00:41:41.228]  And I want to give you Soldier X. We've got his info.
[00:41:41.228 --> 00:41:42.129]  He's actually on duty.
[00:41:42.129 --> 00:41:43.531]  This is his break right now.
[00:41:43.531 --> 00:41:45.533]  He's got to go in about 25 minutes.
[00:41:45.533 --> 00:41:49.058]  Sir, you covered it in an incredible way last night with Rob Due.
[00:41:49.058 --> 00:41:52.742]  In fact, I don't think I could do as good a job as Rob Due did just laying out
[00:41:53.604 --> 00:41:57.669]  All the facts, that video and that interview is at InfoWars.com.
[00:41:57.669 --> 00:42:02.796]  At the bottom of the article, National Guard whistleblower, Doomsday Preppers will be treated as terrorists.
[00:42:02.796 --> 00:42:08.603]  Tell us when this happened, what they called you in, what they said to you guys, word for word.
[00:42:09.244 --> 00:42:20.971]  Tell us exactly what they said to you about the preppers will be targeted as terrorists and troops that are preparing are the term they used.
[00:42:20.971 --> 00:42:23.993]  I guess it means they're calling people like that.
[00:42:23.993 --> 00:42:25.734]  Well, we'll break it all down.
[00:42:25.734 --> 00:42:26.395]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:42:29.238 --> 00:42:32.839]  Okay, there's a little bit of wind there on your phone.
[00:42:32.839 --> 00:42:38.462]  Thank you for joining us, Soldier X. You're here in Texas, a National Guard.
[00:42:38.462 --> 00:42:39.422]  You've got the floor.
[00:42:39.422 --> 00:42:40.142]  Give us a briefing.
[00:42:40.142 --> 00:42:41.543]  Tell people what they told you.
[00:42:41.543 --> 00:42:52.487]  Basically, what we've been told is that these various civil unrests before or after the election are going to be used.
[00:42:53.254 --> 00:42:56.858]  It's almost a long rest, and it's going to take place.
[00:42:56.858 --> 00:43:04.385]  They're going to use National Guard troops to go after people that they see as a threat.
[00:43:04.385 --> 00:43:08.028]  Doomsday preppers are going to be treated as terrorists.
[00:43:08.028 --> 00:43:11.852]  Any soldiers that are doomsday preppers will be treated as suspects.
[00:43:18.853 --> 00:43:22.375]  Well, defect means defector to America.
[00:43:22.375 --> 00:43:24.657]  This is a red dawn takeover through our military.
[00:43:24.657 --> 00:43:30.782]  While they simultaneously say the veterans are the number one terrorist, that you're supposed to march off against them.
[00:43:30.782 --> 00:43:33.064]  Your phone connection isn't as good as it was last night.
[00:43:33.064 --> 00:43:34.925]  Try to talk around on your phone for us, sir.
[00:43:34.925 --> 00:43:37.067]  We appreciate your courage coming on here.
[00:43:37.067 --> 00:43:41.250]  Specifically, though, tell us about the briefing, what they said to you.
[00:43:43.263 --> 00:43:47.165]  I mean, give us every little tidbit.
[00:43:47.165 --> 00:44:07.638]  Um, I know that, uh, as far as prepping for this goes, um, we've been told that, uh, if the fentanyl unrest is bad enough that they're basically going to take over everything, um, from gas stations to grocery stores to God knows what, and, uh,
[00:44:08.439 --> 00:44:20.463]  As far as the parking zone, I've seen where, um, they're saying, and I've seen it myself, uh, receiving equipment to set up makeshift fuel stations.
[00:44:20.463 --> 00:44:23.704]  Makeshift, uh, filling stations?
[00:44:23.704 --> 00:44:28.206]  Yes, uh, we're... Sir, are you on a hands-free?
[00:44:33.511 --> 00:44:40.842]  Sir, I'm gonna have to... I'm gonna have to... We have a pre-show deal where we check a phone line before we put somebody on air.
[00:44:40.842 --> 00:44:44.848]  Are you on a hands-free?
[00:44:44.848 --> 00:44:46.550]  I can barely hear you, Alex.
[00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:48.213]  Are you on a hands-free?
[00:44:52.841 --> 00:44:53.922]  We're going to have to stop the interview.
[00:44:53.922 --> 00:44:54.963]  Thank you.
[00:44:54.963 --> 00:44:57.805]  Let's work with him on his headset.
[00:44:57.805 --> 00:44:59.327]  Free show deal.
[00:44:59.327 --> 00:45:00.988]  Let's work with him on that.
[00:45:00.988 --> 00:45:03.310]  He's probably got a wire.
[00:45:03.310 --> 00:45:05.392]  I can tell from the noises over the years.
[00:45:05.392 --> 00:45:06.153]  And there's wind out there.
[00:45:06.153 --> 00:45:08.074]  He needs to go to the actual handset.
[00:45:08.074 --> 00:45:09.155]  Okay?
[00:45:09.155 --> 00:45:09.636]  Standard deal.
[00:45:10.649 --> 00:45:12.350]  All right.
[00:45:12.350 --> 00:45:14.431]  Again, the full interview will probably just end up airing.
[00:45:14.431 --> 00:45:15.272]  The one he did would do.
[00:45:15.272 --> 00:45:17.013]  Very powerful.
[00:45:17.013 --> 00:45:22.396]  And it ties in with New Orleans was a drill for this.
[00:45:22.396 --> 00:45:28.840]  Make everybody go to the Sports Dome, then go to the rich areas, high and dry, and loot everything and send people to the Sports Dome.
[00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:32.121]  I mean, that's what they've been training for, is cordoning cities, locking things down.
[00:45:32.121 --> 00:45:36.084]  I want to get Stuart Rhodes on the Nightly News tonight with me if we can do that.
[00:45:37.062 --> 00:45:41.304]  Well, or even later in the broadcast.
[00:45:41.304 --> 00:45:44.865]  Again, last night he was off duty, so he was able to be on a clear line.
[00:45:44.865 --> 00:45:51.748]  He's just ducking out, obviously nervous, outside his post, talking to us right now here in Texas.
[00:45:51.748 --> 00:45:56.770]  And we appreciate his courage coming on the broadcast, but obviously you can't put audio like that on air.
[00:45:56.770 --> 00:45:57.751]  It's an audio format.
[00:45:58.691 --> 00:46:08.919]  Okay, again, I think what we'll probably do is when we start the next hour, because it's so important, I'm going to air excerpts of the Rob Dew interview.
[00:46:08.919 --> 00:46:16.064]  It's so important to get this interview out to everyone.
[00:46:16.064 --> 00:46:22.069]  National Guard whistleblower Doomsday Preppers will be treated as terrorist.
[00:46:24.472 --> 00:46:30.826]  And Melissa Melton's article starts, I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:46:30.826 --> 00:46:33.893]  And the Bill of Rights and Constitution and Declaration of Independence clearly states.
[00:46:34.875 --> 00:46:45.364]  Everything we're publicly seeing from the TSA to highway checkpoints to NSA warrantless spying to drones, it's all totally illegal and we have a lawless government run by foreign banks.
[00:46:45.364 --> 00:46:49.987]  In fact, guys, we just played Ted Turner saying he's glad the troops are killing themselves on CNN.
[00:46:49.987 --> 00:46:52.790]  People seem to be so broke back, they think that's okay out there.
[00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:54.951]  Two days, national TV, not even an issue.
[00:46:55.994 --> 00:47:01.879]  Can you queue up the CNBC thing where they said foreign banks have conquered us in a world government and run us?
[00:47:01.879 --> 00:47:02.720]  That clip's important.
[00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:19.875]  I think new listeners have a lot of new affiliates out there, a lot of new stations out there need to be aware of this, that there's people that have taken over our government, bigger than Obama, who hate the Republic and are re-engineering America in a Soviet-style breakdown takeover.
[00:47:20.995 --> 00:47:29.603]  So, here is that clip from CNBC, where they tell you, you are slaves to foreign banks, world government, but it doesn't exist.
[00:47:29.603 --> 00:47:30.584]  The ADL says, here it is.
[00:47:32.142 --> 00:47:34.744]  Actually, what they do is hold summits?
[00:47:34.744 --> 00:47:39.328]  I think that right now the question is, do we all work for central bankers?
[00:47:39.328 --> 00:47:42.130]  That's what I want to address to our guest tonight.
[00:47:42.130 --> 00:47:44.252]  Is this global governance at last?
[00:47:44.252 --> 00:47:46.754]  Is it one world, the central bankers in charge?
[00:47:46.754 --> 00:47:51.718]  Jim Iorio, you say we've got some downside here, a correction in the markets.
[00:47:51.718 --> 00:47:52.419]  Fine.
[00:47:52.419 --> 00:47:56.002]  But aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[00:47:56.002 --> 00:47:59.385]  Aren't we all just counting on the fact that there's a Bernanke pot
[00:48:01.426 --> 00:48:09.891]  Of course we are, because if we look at the economic data, there's nothing to get excited about in that.
[00:48:09.891 --> 00:48:20.397]  Yesterday we saw some reluctance for the Bernanke Fed to expand their balance sheets and pump more money in, but the stock market knows that reluctance is totally different than not willing to do it at all.
[00:48:20.397 --> 00:48:26.320]  And that's why we saw oil implode and gold trade off heavily, because they're not a protected class.
[00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:27.761]  If the stock market starts trading off
[00:48:27.901 --> 00:48:31.163]  And it goes on with the other guest saying, yeah, we're slaves to foreign banks.
[00:48:31.163 --> 00:48:32.003]  Here's Kurt Nemo's article.
[00:48:32.003 --> 00:48:37.186]  European Union has put out new posters all over the 15 member states with a giant star with, you guessed it, a hammer and sickle on it.
[00:48:56.454 --> 00:49:06.521]  And this is being put up all over Europe by the European Union government, unelected, and it has the hammer and sickle on it.
[00:49:06.521 --> 00:49:09.503]  See, it's time for everything to be in your face now.
[00:49:09.503 --> 00:49:11.085]  You understand?
[00:49:11.085 --> 00:49:15.668]  It's time for everything to be in your face because they're about to go live on us.
[00:49:15.668 --> 00:49:16.929]  They're about to go hot on us.
[00:49:18.815 --> 00:49:31.441]  And the hammer and sickle has, under the Soviets and under the Communists and other areas like China, has conservatively, in the last hundred years, since 1917, so in the last, you know, 90-something years, killed 170-plus million people.
[00:49:31.441 --> 00:49:34.142]  Hitler, all casualties combined, 20 million.
[00:49:34.142 --> 00:49:34.782]  Over a hundred
[00:49:46.696 --> 00:49:51.877]  And 50, some estimates are 170, they vary, 150, 160, 170, whatever.
[00:49:51.877 --> 00:49:57.918]  100, because they argue about how many mal kill was it, 60-something million or 80-something million.
[00:49:57.918 --> 00:50:01.079]  The CIA says 60-something million, they helped put him in at 49.
[00:50:01.079 --> 00:50:05.980]  The Chinese government today says, apologizes, says 60, I mean says 80-something million.
[00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:07.700]  Let me talk about these numbers.
[00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:11.001]  Okay, they will do this here.
[00:50:11.001 --> 00:50:15.182]  You've heard the FBI people that infiltrated the weatherman here.
[00:50:16.092 --> 00:50:23.955]  Where they said, yeah, they said once they take over and collapse things, they're gonna put 50 million in re-education camps and kill half.
[00:50:23.955 --> 00:50:30.877]  And that's the plan, is to tell the military during a collapse, okay, here's a list of people that are terrorists and they're just gonna fly over with helicopters and blow your house up.
[00:50:31.673 --> 00:50:39.240]  And the average starving welfare person will be like, on the news, watching the television, going, woo-hoo, yeah, take out the terrorists!
[00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:45.426]  And it'll be, we'll get the lights back on, we'll get all the power back on, and people will be in community areas watching the TVs.
[00:50:45.426 --> 00:50:49.729]  We'll get you more food, more welfare, more Obama phones as soon as we've rounded up the terrorists.
[00:50:49.729 --> 00:50:53.533]  And the entire military, the police, are training to take on the veterans.
[00:50:53.533 --> 00:50:54.934]  Which is actually meant to wipe them out.
[00:50:54.934 --> 00:50:57.396]  They want us all to kill each other in a staged civil war.
[00:50:57.396 --> 00:50:57.797]  Stay with us.

[00:54:14.757 --> 00:54:25.507]  I know the globalists are upset that our founders fought for the Second Amendment as an emergency backup against takeovers by infiltrators just like this, the number one thing they were worried about.
[00:54:25.507 --> 00:54:30.331]  I know that you're mad that a lot of us still know how to skin a buck and run a trot line.
[00:54:30.331 --> 00:54:33.855]  You're very upset that we know how to use firearms and that we won't go to your FEMA camps.
[00:54:35.004 --> 00:54:36.985]  And I know you hate the troops.
[00:54:36.985 --> 00:54:40.526]  Simultaneously, you need to use the troops against the American people.
[00:54:40.526 --> 00:54:43.627]  So you try to tell the troops the veterans are the enemy.
[00:54:43.627 --> 00:54:47.848]  I mean, folks, just look at the people running the government say George Washington's bad.
[00:54:47.848 --> 00:54:49.769]  Now, he was able to get a clear line.
[00:54:49.769 --> 00:54:51.930]  He's got about 15 minutes with us.
[00:54:51.930 --> 00:54:54.271]  Let's go back to Soldier X. Recap.
[00:54:54.271 --> 00:54:54.991]  You've got the floor.
[00:54:54.991 --> 00:54:56.411]  This is a short segment.
[00:54:56.411 --> 00:55:03.894]  When this happened, what you were told, not exactly where, they'll figure out where you're at here in Texas, and then what they told you and what the response was.
[00:55:03.894 --> 00:55:04.194]  Go ahead.
[00:55:05.359 --> 00:55:22.889]  Okay, um, it was about two weeks ago we had a briefing and they told us that, um, that they were preparing for civil unrest before, during, and after the election and that during the civil unrest that the National Guard would be used to go out and calm the civil unrest.
[00:55:23.407 --> 00:55:34.971]  The problem with that is that they're saying that our top contenders as enemies would be the Doomsday Purpers and that they would be treated as terrorists and that we were to take them as terrorists.
[00:55:34.971 --> 00:55:43.094]  They told us that any soldiers that were the Doomsday Purpers would also be treated as defects and that they would be handled accordingly.
[00:55:43.094 --> 00:55:47.855]  I don't know what they meant by handled accordingly, but that's the words they used.
[00:55:47.855 --> 00:55:52.257]  There's a lot of stuff going on right now where we're hearing
[00:55:53.573 --> 00:56:09.648]  A lot of stuff about how, and I learned this from one of my NCOs, that they're going to use the National Guard troops to go take infants away from regular American people, and any of us who decide not to do that will be handled accordingly.
[00:56:11.886 --> 00:56:36.301]  I grew up in Texas and all that good stuff, and I grew up with guns, and I don't, you know, my dad taught me all about the Second Amendment, and my dad's been listening to you, Alex, since before Y2K, and so basically, I mean, I've been raised on the Second Amendment and the belief in it, and I see through all the holes that, you know,
[00:56:37.549 --> 00:56:44.634]  Sure, just to be clear, your NCO is telling you you're preparing for gun confiscation, and I guess he thinks that's going to be a fun mission.
[00:56:44.634 --> 00:56:51.438]  I mean, this is open treason, saying Americans that are getting prepared for the collapse, that we're terrorists.
[00:56:51.438 --> 00:56:55.501]  I mean, that's a total act of treason, sedition against the Republic.
[00:56:55.501 --> 00:56:59.723]  That is a military insurrection for a foreign power.
[00:56:59.723 --> 00:57:01.745]  It's totally illegal.
[00:57:01.745 --> 00:57:06.748]  I mean, does your NCO, non-commissioned officer, seem excited about this?
[00:57:08.552 --> 00:57:09.093]  No.
[00:57:09.093 --> 00:57:28.054]  The group of us that have said that we will not be part of the taking of the guns and be part of the calming of the civil unrest, basically we haven't been open about it in front of our commanders and stuff because we don't want anything to happen to us.
[00:57:28.823 --> 00:57:40.452]  Yeah, no, I think the time is for everybody to start going public and doing YouTube videos and go to the media, and they can't get everybody, and we'll stop this attempted coup d'etat that they're trying to complete against our country.
[00:57:40.452 --> 00:57:41.813]  Do you understand, sir?
[00:57:41.813 --> 00:57:42.774]  That's not rhetoric.
[00:57:42.774 --> 00:57:47.357]  What you're being told is high treason and totally illegal by these people.
[00:57:47.357 --> 00:57:56.424]  Yes, sir, and I do understand that, and mine and my buddy's plans were that when the shit hits the fan for us to go where we consider under the ground, and, um,
[00:57:58.283 --> 00:58:03.185]  Wait for the right time to be able to take back America.
[00:58:03.185 --> 00:58:12.909]  Well, the right time is now in the Info War, sir, and you're doing that on air, and I commend you, but I mean, look, we got the Army manuals admitting gun confiscation drills.
[00:58:12.909 --> 00:58:15.170]  They're all linked in the article by Melissa Melton.
[00:58:15.170 --> 00:58:15.530]  All of it.
[00:58:15.530 --> 00:58:17.711]  I mean, it's time for talk show host.
[00:58:17.711 --> 00:58:25.354]  It's time for everybody to realize we've got a criminal, rotten government, and if we don't stand up to these crooks now, they're going to drop the hammer and try to totally take over.
[00:58:25.354 --> 00:58:25.754]  And people,
[00:58:26.676 --> 00:58:32.579]  If you think cowering to these scum is going to protect us, think again.
[00:58:32.579 --> 00:58:36.641]  The only way to beat these people is to get in their face now.
[00:58:36.641 --> 00:58:43.344]  Stay there, we'll be right back.
[00:58:43.344 --> 00:58:47.086]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:50.407 --> 00:58:52.888]  Cold and flu season is upon us.

[00:59:53.374 --> 00:59:55.756]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.756 --> 00:59:58.539]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:09.947]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:09.947 --> 01:00:11.529]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.529 --> 01:00:13.452]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.452 --> 01:00:17.277]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.277 --> 01:00:21.342]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.950 --> 01:00:24.150]  We're into hour number two.
[01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:26.391]  Our guests can stay with us for another 15 minutes.
[01:00:26.391 --> 01:00:31.753]  If you go to PrisonPlanet.com or Infoworks.com, I'm going to have these stories red-linked.
[01:00:31.753 --> 01:00:35.554]  National Guard whistleblower, doomsday preppers will be treated as terrorists.
[01:00:35.554 --> 01:00:39.135]  Then we linked all the admissions separately in media.
[01:00:39.135 --> 01:00:40.815]  And by the military of that.
[01:00:40.815 --> 01:00:41.816]  Just open treason.
[01:00:41.816 --> 01:00:43.756]  They're just normalizing it in front of everyone.
[01:00:43.756 --> 01:00:47.617]  And an incredible CNN clip that's gotten no attention from Piers Morgan.
[01:00:50.339 --> 01:00:52.040]  Ted Turner, I think it's good U.S.
[01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:53.401]  troops are killing themselves.
[01:00:53.401 --> 01:01:00.325]  All right, going back to Soldier X. He's in the National Guard out of Texas.
[01:01:00.325 --> 01:01:04.347]  He sent us all his documentation, everything he tells us we can already check out separately.
[01:01:04.347 --> 01:01:09.330]  He's just giving us an inside perspective, but I can confirm what he's saying.
[01:01:09.330 --> 01:01:17.535]  Sir, just continue here with, I mean, what's it like when your NCOs are telling you that, yeah, during the collapse, we'll go take guns, which we saw in Katrina.
[01:01:17.995 --> 01:01:18.575]  I don't agree with it.
[01:01:18.575 --> 01:01:19.536]  I mean, it's a suicide mission.
[01:01:19.536 --> 01:01:23.698]  You're talking about going and taking guns from regular hard-working Americans who are willing to die for their guns.
[01:01:23.698 --> 01:01:24.899]  And I'm not going to stand
[01:01:46.184 --> 01:02:00.480]  Well, what they're going to do is they're going to do propaganda and burn down houses and blow them up, say terrorists, turn your guns in if you want food.
[01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:04.805]  They know the preppers have got food, so they'll be able to withstand the Soviet-style takeover.
[01:02:04.805 --> 01:02:07.067]  That's what this is, is a siege takeover.
[01:02:08.508 --> 01:02:11.430]  And they're worried about all sorts of insurrection, you name it.
[01:02:11.430 --> 01:02:12.790]  But the globalists want that.
[01:02:12.790 --> 01:02:15.371]  They want the military and police fighting with the citizens.
[01:02:15.371 --> 01:02:18.212]  They're going to sit offshore while a civil war starts.
[01:02:18.212 --> 01:02:21.314]  I'm telling you, that's on the front burner now.
[01:02:21.314 --> 01:02:28.377]  They've got all these fake anonymous groups calling for storming the White House the day before the election and for bombing things.
[01:02:28.377 --> 01:02:33.299]  And remember all the Obama's top advisers saying he needs a terror attack to blame it on his enemies?
[01:02:33.299 --> 01:02:33.779]  Remember that?
[01:02:37.337 --> 01:02:39.738]  Do you remember that, Soldier X?
[01:02:39.738 --> 01:02:42.059]  Yes, yes, I remember that.
[01:02:42.059 --> 01:02:43.800]  Well, we link to all that in our articles.
[01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:46.161]  I'll have a special report tonight.
[01:02:46.161 --> 01:02:49.082]  Keep giving us other tidbits here.
[01:02:49.082 --> 01:02:55.104]  There's been prepping for the takeover, basically.
[01:02:55.104 --> 01:03:00.526]  During the civil unrest, we're supposed to take over grocery stores, gas stations, and what have you.
[01:03:00.526 --> 01:03:01.687]  There's been prepping for that.
[01:03:03.368 --> 01:03:08.231]  They've been receiving pieces of equipment to put together makeshift fuel points.
[01:03:08.231 --> 01:03:14.554]  Basically, they'll be able to set these fuel bags up anywhere they want and set up a fuel point, shut off any gas stations.
[01:03:14.554 --> 01:03:25.140]  And if you want fuel, you're going to have to go to them to get it, which means you're going to have to turn yourself over or give up your guns or whatever they want for you in order for you to get fuel and the things you need to survive.
[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:26.080]  That's right.
[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:29.583]  It's a drawing and coordinating and blockading.
[01:03:29.583 --> 01:03:34.407]  Exactly what Stuart Rhodes has gotten intel on, and the military is openly training for this.
[01:03:34.407 --> 01:03:40.232]  And that's how they always get your guns, and that's how the Soviets do it, is they lock everybody down.
[01:03:40.232 --> 01:03:44.955]  That's why the TSA, Rob Dude just flew out to see his wife, who's working out of town.
[01:03:44.955 --> 01:03:49.039]  He said TSA was all past the checkpoint searching people and running IDs.
[01:03:49.659 --> 01:04:03.390]  And that's what it is, you're just, oh, okay, you try to come in the grocery store, they got troops there, they'll have TSA-style goons there, who are the political officers, they run your license, oh, come with us, we need to talk to you, everybody's trained to go with them, and you just disappear.
[01:04:03.390 --> 01:04:06.773]  Then they load you on a truck to go to actual killers.
[01:04:06.773 --> 01:04:18.543]  And they're gonna get off on it, I mean, they're really, scum like this just, you can see them get creamy-eyed when they're loading people on trucks, just the pleasure of that to these powerless, weak scum, it's an aphrodisiac to them.
[01:04:20.825 --> 01:04:33.511]  Well, I can tell you that there's a lot of us who have decided that when the shit does hit the fan that we're not going to answer the call to come forward and help these people.
[01:04:33.511 --> 01:04:40.574]  Well, to help the enemy, what I consider the enemy, the people that I've been fighting for all this time.
[01:04:40.574 --> 01:04:44.996]  I never thought that they would stab me in the back and do this to me, but they are.
[01:04:45.316 --> 01:04:47.520]  Alright, listen, we're gonna come back with a final segment with you.
[01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:50.144]  We've been delaying you on the radio using profanity.
[01:04:50.144 --> 01:04:53.810]  I understand it's military culture, but you can't do it again, okay?
[01:04:53.810 --> 01:04:55.052]  Or I'm gonna have to let you go.
[01:04:55.052 --> 01:04:56.394]  Three's the charm.
[01:04:56.394 --> 01:04:57.195]  Stay with us.
[01:04:57.195 --> 01:04:57.796]  One more segment.
[01:05:00.453 --> 01:05:03.915]  Alex Jones here with a very important announcement for truth seekers.
[01:05:03.915 --> 01:05:09.878]  We've carried a lot of amazing films and books over the years on the online video bookstore at Infowars.com.
[01:05:09.878 --> 01:05:16.462]  And out of all the titles we've carried, one stands out because it is just so chillingly convincing.
[01:05:16.462 --> 01:05:22.145]  And that's Dreams from My Real Father by Joel Gilbert, available at Infowars.com.
[01:05:22.145 --> 01:05:25.787]  This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen.
[01:05:25.987 --> 01:05:29.770]  If you want to know who Obama's real daddy is, this is the film for you.
[01:05:29.770 --> 01:05:34.375]  Don't forget, your purchase supports our broadcast and our growing media network.
[01:05:34.375 --> 01:05:36.897]  You'll also find it at Infowarshop.com.
[01:05:36.897 --> 01:05:40.740]  None Dare Call a Conspiracy by Gary Allen, the book that woke me up.
[01:05:40.740 --> 01:05:45.164]  We're also carrying Behind the Green Mask, UN Agenda 21, by Rosa Corey.
[01:05:45.164 --> 01:05:47.807]  This book is coffin nails to the globalist takeover.
[01:05:48.107 --> 01:05:54.934]  The Greater Good, the most professional and up-to-date film I've ever seen, exposing the scourge that is vaccines.
[01:05:54.934 --> 01:06:00.259]  These titles and a lot more are all available at InfoWarshop.com.
[01:06:00.259 --> 01:06:03.562]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water?
[01:06:04.002 --> 01:06:05.743]  Laughing as you get sick and die?
[01:06:05.743 --> 01:06:08.145]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[01:06:08.145 --> 01:06:13.868]  My friends, I've done a lot of research, and the best gravity filter out there, bar none, is ProPure.
[01:06:13.868 --> 01:06:17.250]  And it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[01:06:17.250 --> 01:06:20.692]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[01:06:20.692 --> 01:06:22.373]  There's no priming required.
[01:06:22.373 --> 01:06:24.655]  It's NSF-42 certified.
[01:06:24.655 --> 01:06:27.156]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[01:06:28.217 --> 01:06:29.738]  Easy to set up and use.
[01:06:29.738 --> 01:06:31.158]  Doesn't require electricity.
[01:06:31.158 --> 01:06:34.340]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[01:06:34.340 --> 01:06:37.702]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[01:06:37.702 --> 01:06:41.864]  Save money by not buying bottled water, and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[01:06:41.864 --> 01:06:44.585]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[01:06:44.585 --> 01:06:46.166]  It's what my family uses.
[01:06:46.166 --> 01:06:49.487]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.

[01:06:57.891 --> 01:07:01.252]  Aaron Fullin here.
[01:07:01.252 --> 01:07:12.856]  As the food police shut down food co-ops, the Amish, and small farmers, Americans are losing access, not just to raw milk and homemade cheeses, but to healthy, home-crafted sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut, yogurt, and kefir.
[01:07:12.856 --> 01:07:16.677]  It seems there's a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria.
[01:07:16.897 --> 01:07:19.658]  But frankly, I'm not sure what the food police are so afraid of.
[01:07:19.658 --> 01:07:27.540]  These remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history, with archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found across the globe in almost every culture.
[01:07:27.540 --> 01:07:35.042]  Even today, Japanese eat miso, Africans eat fermented porridges, Koreans eat kimchi, and in India, fermented milk is a staple for healthy living.
[01:07:35.342 --> 01:07:36.483]  But here's some good news.
[01:07:36.483 --> 01:07:42.686]  Self-reliant Americans can now discover the secrets to making these amazing fermented foods legally and privately in their own homes.
[01:07:42.686 --> 01:07:46.027]  Since it's still legal to make these foods as long as you can make them yourself.
[01:07:46.027 --> 01:07:48.869]  For more information, check out fermentationfactor.com.
[01:07:48.869 --> 01:07:50.870]  That's fermentationfactor.com.
[01:07:50.870 --> 01:07:53.311]  It's easy to create your own powerful fermented foods.
[01:07:53.311 --> 01:07:57.013]  And you can do it by going to www.fermentationfactor.com.
[01:07:57.013 --> 01:07:59.714]  That's www.fermentationfactor.com.
[01:08:05.879 --> 01:08:07.800]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:19.429]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:19.429 --> 01:08:21.630]  Yes, my friends, and I am your host, Alex Jones.
[01:08:21.630 --> 01:08:26.274]  If you just joined us, we have Soldier X, who is on base.
[01:08:26.274 --> 01:08:30.197]  And during the break, I was talking to him, and an officer walked over and started giving him orders.
[01:08:31.494 --> 01:08:35.496]  So he's getting out of that area that he's in and he's outside.
[01:08:35.496 --> 01:08:37.697]  I don't know how long he can stay on with us.
[01:08:37.697 --> 01:08:39.759]  We've confirmed who he is.
[01:08:39.759 --> 01:08:44.861]  Everything he's told us we've already reverse engineered and have army training manuals and other sources.
[01:08:44.861 --> 01:08:45.742]  I can confirm it all.
[01:08:45.742 --> 01:08:53.326]  You saw Katrina where they went and took the guns of the high and dry people that they saw as preppers that were prepared and self-sufficient.
[01:08:54.383 --> 01:08:55.886]  That's the enemy of the globalists.
[01:08:55.886 --> 01:08:58.130]  Globalism is about deindustrialization.
[01:08:58.130 --> 01:09:05.523]  Now I want you to recap everything you told me and then tell me the part about the I4 NATO troops because in the NLE training...
[01:09:06.627 --> 01:09:11.349]  National level exercise 9, 10, 11, 12 they classified.
[01:09:11.349 --> 01:09:16.152]  They said they train with troops from 14 nations to take on quote American terrorists.
[01:09:16.152 --> 01:09:19.714]  So we do know that they do plan to use mercenaries.
[01:09:19.714 --> 01:09:21.274]  They also want to use drones.
[01:09:21.274 --> 01:09:28.178]  Those can be pre-programmed to go take out patriots and then have plausible deniability and even say terrorists blew up somebody's house.
[01:09:28.698 --> 01:09:32.642]  So that's why we're going into this cyber war system as well.
[01:09:32.642 --> 01:09:33.383]  God help us.
[01:09:33.383 --> 01:09:36.846]  A lot of people are going to hear this and decide to serve the New World Order.
[01:09:36.846 --> 01:09:39.909]  They're going to crouch down and lick the hand that feeds them.
[01:09:39.909 --> 01:09:45.615]  Those that cried, appease, appease, were hung by those they tried to please.
[01:09:45.615 --> 01:09:49.799]  When freedom fails, good men rot in filthy jails.
[01:09:49.799 --> 01:09:51.040]  This is the globalist takeover.
[01:09:52.134 --> 01:09:53.254]  I mean, they're coming out in the open.
[01:09:53.254 --> 01:09:55.975]  Ted Turner's on the news saying he wants troops to commit suicide.
[01:09:55.975 --> 01:09:56.956]  It's a good thing.
[01:09:56.956 --> 01:09:58.056]  Played that clip last hour.
[01:09:58.056 --> 01:09:58.536]  I'm not joking.
[01:09:58.536 --> 01:10:00.137]  We'll play it again.
[01:10:00.137 --> 01:10:02.498]  We have open world government being announced on the news channels.
[01:10:02.498 --> 01:10:06.179]  New World Order was announced again with Ted Turner.
[01:10:06.179 --> 01:10:12.982]  They are just doing it because a lot of the public doesn't know what planet they're on who are into sports and entertainment.
[01:10:12.982 --> 01:10:15.243]  And to those of us that are aware, we're the enemy.
[01:10:15.243 --> 01:10:17.423]  Well, obviously, we're not under the mind control.
[01:10:17.423 --> 01:10:18.884]  We're not under the... Okay.
[01:10:19.204 --> 01:10:20.426]  Recap everything he said.
[01:10:20.426 --> 01:10:22.268]  Get to the latest info.
[01:10:22.268 --> 01:10:30.618]  And again, then I want to talk to you about when they're in these meetings, telling all of you that, you know, if you're a prepper or a patriot, you're the enemy you'll be dealt with.
[01:10:30.618 --> 01:10:32.781]  If you, you know, we're going to get the guns.
[01:10:32.781 --> 01:10:35.224]  If you don't go along with it, you're going to be dealt with.
[01:10:35.224 --> 01:10:37.206]  I mean, that is, let me tell you, folks.
[01:10:38.127 --> 01:10:41.253]  I've never called for violence, but don't go to a FEMA camp.
[01:10:41.253 --> 01:10:42.475]  And don't let them take you away.
[01:10:42.475 --> 01:10:46.441]  If people just go, OK, I'll go with you, they're going to win.
[01:10:46.441 --> 01:10:49.346]  And my God, I mean, this is real, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:10:50.220 --> 01:10:52.141]  This is so insane, but it's real.
[01:10:52.141 --> 01:10:52.621]  It's history.
[01:10:52.621 --> 01:10:54.622]  Look at all the other countries, what they've gone through.
[01:10:54.622 --> 01:10:56.302]  It's all being set up here.
[01:10:56.302 --> 01:10:57.843]  The government, 1.6 billion bullets.
[01:10:57.843 --> 01:10:59.463]  Okay, you've got the floor.
[01:10:59.463 --> 01:11:03.085]  We'll call you Soldier X. Known to us.
[01:11:03.085 --> 01:11:05.666]  We have your military ID, history, whole deal.
[01:11:05.666 --> 01:11:07.866]  Made some calls, confirmed things.
[01:11:07.866 --> 01:11:16.890]  But everything you're saying in Melissa Belton's article off Rob Dew's report last night has all the links to backing up in mainstream news what you've said, but you're putting it all together.
[01:11:16.890 --> 01:11:17.510]  Recap it all.
[01:11:18.689 --> 01:11:28.297]  Okay, um, basically what's happening is, uh, the troops are being told that they're going to be used in the civil unrest that they expect to happen before, during, and after the election.
[01:11:28.297 --> 01:11:48.073]  There's been prepping for the certification, uh, for taking over grocery stores, fuel points, uh, gas stations, basically shutting everything down and setting up makeshift points where, if you want stuff, you're going to have to go to the American government to get it, which means if you own guns, if you own weapons or anything,
[01:11:48.694 --> 01:11:53.471]  You're gonna have to turn those things over in order to get these things you need to survive and basically
[01:11:55.353 --> 01:12:06.520]  They've said that any of these doomsday preppers will be treated as terrorists and that any of us National Guard guys who consider ourselves doomsday preppers would be treated as defects and we'd be handled accordingly.
[01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:11.964]  During these meetings when they've told us these things, it's kind of like shock and awe.
[01:12:11.964 --> 01:12:20.409]  I mean, they tell you these things and in your head, you know, you'd never thought you'd hear that from your leaders that, you know, this is actually happening in our country.
[01:12:20.409 --> 01:12:21.250]  It's always something that
[01:12:21.950 --> 01:12:27.854]  Yeah, they might as well slap, you know, hammers and sickles on the sides of the tanks.
[01:12:27.854 --> 01:12:28.775]  Right.
[01:12:28.775 --> 01:12:30.436]  Go ahead, keep going.
[01:12:30.436 --> 01:12:50.208]  And so, basically what we see happening, because I know there's a big number of troops that aren't going to want to go along with this fascist movement, and they're going to want to basically break away and join the rest of the patriots in the fight against this movement.
[01:12:52.066 --> 01:12:56.972]  So, our question was, you know, if we walk away, who are they going to have to fight for them?
[01:12:56.972 --> 01:13:06.743]  Well, you know, every day we hear the news about how, oh, we're no longer at war, we're just peacekeeping and all this, but if we're not at war, then why are we preparing for war?
[01:13:06.743 --> 01:13:12.189]  They're still building war fighting vehicles, they're still building war fighting equipment, they're still doing all
[01:13:12.389 --> 01:13:14.211]  They have the biggest defense budget ever.
[01:13:14.211 --> 01:13:14.932]  They just don't.
[01:13:14.932 --> 01:13:15.692]  Under the U.N.
[01:13:15.692 --> 01:13:21.558]  model, where they go around murdering, bombing, slaughtering, raping, killing people, putting them in slave labor camps.
[01:13:21.558 --> 01:13:22.099]  Just look it up.
[01:13:22.099 --> 01:13:22.799]  Look up U.N.
[01:13:22.799 --> 01:13:23.961]  sex trade, U.N.
[01:13:23.961 --> 01:13:24.942]  slave camps, U.N.
[01:13:24.942 --> 01:13:26.483]  slave labor everywhere.
[01:13:26.483 --> 01:13:27.724]  They call it peacekeeping.
[01:13:27.724 --> 01:13:30.027]  It's like Obama is the peace prize winner.
[01:13:30.027 --> 01:13:30.807]  All these new wars.
[01:13:31.528 --> 01:13:36.374]  With Al-Qaeda, helping Al-Qaeda, our government working with Al-Qaeda, are called peace operations.
[01:13:36.374 --> 01:13:39.618]  And he'll get more awards the more people he kills.
[01:13:39.618 --> 01:13:48.808]  So it's all a big sick joke, but they signed deals with the Mexican and Canadian government a decade ago to quote, work together to fight terrorists inside the U.S.
[01:13:48.808 --> 01:13:49.629]  or insurrections.
[01:13:50.290 --> 01:13:54.534]  I would say with all the ones that I always have contact with, I would say between 80 and 90% of them aren't going to stand for this.
[01:14:20.467 --> 01:14:22.227]  Yeah, that's the numbers we've got.
[01:14:22.227 --> 01:14:27.429]  And so what they're going to do is they're going to attack the military and say patriots did it.
[01:14:27.429 --> 01:14:28.909]  Just be ready for that.
[01:14:28.909 --> 01:14:35.031]  And again, if you're an offshore global crime syndicate that wants to bring down the United States and reorganize it, what do you do?
[01:14:35.031 --> 01:14:39.332]  You get the military and police who in your own manuals you say are your big enemies.
[01:14:39.332 --> 01:14:44.053]  The high level manuals say that's who they don't trust because they know on average they're not bad men and women.
[01:14:44.053 --> 01:14:45.073]  They've been compartmentalized.
[01:14:45.473 --> 01:14:48.515]  So you try to get the younger ones to hate the older ones.
[01:14:48.515 --> 01:14:49.915]  The Nazis did this.
[01:14:49.915 --> 01:14:50.956]  The Soviets did this.
[01:14:50.956 --> 01:14:53.477]  When Mao took over, he did this two years after taking over.
[01:14:53.477 --> 01:14:54.718]  Hitler did it less than a year.
[01:14:54.718 --> 01:14:55.678]  Night of the Long Knives.
[01:14:55.678 --> 01:14:57.779]  Look it up.
[01:14:57.779 --> 01:14:58.399]  Lenin did it.
[01:14:58.399 --> 01:14:59.700]  Then Stalin did it.
[01:14:59.700 --> 01:15:00.701]  Then Khrushchev did it.
[01:15:00.701 --> 01:15:02.662]  They always get rid of the last group.
[01:15:02.662 --> 01:15:05.063]  Whatever group brings them in, they long knife.
[01:15:05.803 --> 01:15:06.644]  Okay?
[01:15:06.644 --> 01:15:07.504]  And that's it.
[01:15:07.504 --> 01:15:11.147]  They do want to have... It's called a purge of the military and police.
[01:15:11.147 --> 01:15:13.028]  And look, none of this has to happen.
[01:15:13.028 --> 01:15:14.249]  I want to explain something.
[01:15:14.249 --> 01:15:17.732]  I don't think this is probably... I'm going to tell you my gut.
[01:15:17.732 --> 01:15:20.373]  I don't think this is going to happen because we've gotten the word out.
[01:15:20.373 --> 01:15:21.154]  You've gotten the word out.
[01:15:21.154 --> 01:15:22.215]  I know the globalist model.
[01:15:22.215 --> 01:15:22.975]  Listen to me carefully.
[01:15:22.975 --> 01:15:23.796]  I want to get your take on this.
[01:15:25.103 --> 01:15:27.544]  They put out these ideas over and over again.
[01:15:27.544 --> 01:15:36.727]  I've been to drills, you know, 14 years ago witnessing just this, and people saw it and said, those can't be real Marines back then because it was just so alien.
[01:15:36.727 --> 01:15:40.369]  Now, we've all just had it introduced.
[01:15:40.369 --> 01:15:41.569]  The officer's telling you this.
[01:15:41.569 --> 01:15:42.529]  They're compartmentalized.
[01:15:42.529 --> 01:15:43.470]  They don't know.
[01:15:43.470 --> 01:15:45.810]  They're told to take notes on responses.
[01:15:45.810 --> 01:15:49.552]  So they're intelligence gathering because a foreign enemy's taken over.
[01:15:49.552 --> 01:15:52.053]  The officers are operating as foreign enemy agents now.
[01:15:53.264 --> 01:16:07.455]  They're assessing who will go along with this, and they're marking them down for sheep-dipping cadres to lead Homeland Brigade covert groups, Infra-Guard-type groups.
[01:16:07.455 --> 01:16:12.158]  They're looking for people for the security services to really take us down later.
[01:16:13.459 --> 01:16:16.001]  And then they're identifying those of you to put on list.
[01:16:16.001 --> 01:16:17.623]  They can't move against us now.
[01:16:17.623 --> 01:16:19.845]  A foreign force can't move against us now.
[01:16:19.845 --> 01:16:21.206]  They may be bold and try it though.
[01:16:21.206 --> 01:16:28.052]  I've miscalculated before with how arrogant and the unspeakable bravado.
[01:16:29.192 --> 01:16:33.395]  I don't know, the best term would be hubris of these people.
[01:16:33.395 --> 01:16:36.176]  It's hubris, the power of infinity.
[01:16:36.176 --> 01:16:39.178]  They may try it though, because here's why I may be wrong.
[01:16:39.178 --> 01:16:44.060]  When I'm wargaming all this in my mind and all my study, they could plan it on being the Civil War.
[01:16:44.060 --> 01:16:50.544]  See, either they want the Civil War for us all to kill each other, and they could drop the hammer, but the military and police will just be annihilated.
[01:16:50.544 --> 01:16:51.885]  There's 170 million gun owners.
[01:16:51.885 --> 01:16:52.465]  I estimate 10%
[01:16:56.067 --> 01:16:57.928]  My take on that is that they're already wiping
[01:17:25.647 --> 01:17:29.190]  Wiping those of us who aren't going to stand with them out.
[01:17:29.190 --> 01:17:39.859]  There's been troops that recently have been kicked out of the military that have given 20 to 30 years of their lives to this military.
[01:17:39.859 --> 01:17:46.384]  And they call it that they're doing cutbacks and replacing the ranks with new faces and new soldiers.
[01:17:46.384 --> 01:17:49.507]  But we don't see the replacing at all.
[01:17:49.507 --> 01:17:50.948]  All we see is the getting rid of.
[01:17:51.568 --> 01:17:59.511]  And basically, the way they're doing that is, before this year, what they used to do, they used to send you a random letter in the mail saying, sorry, you're out of a job.
[01:17:59.511 --> 01:18:04.053]  And in the National Guard, if you're a federal technician, you have to be in the Guard to have your job.
[01:18:04.053 --> 01:18:14.137]  And once you get that letter saying, sorry, your service is no longer needed in the Guard, you're out of a job and there's no transition programs, there's nothing in place to help you go from soldier to civilian.
[01:18:14.137 --> 01:18:16.998]  And so basically, they just throw you out on the street with nothing.
[01:18:17.859 --> 01:18:23.303]  And basically, that just seems like they're... And again, and then they're going to make you the enemy.
[01:18:23.303 --> 01:18:24.584]  They've said you're the enemy.
[01:18:24.584 --> 01:18:27.605]  They make people serve six, seven, eight tours.
[01:18:27.605 --> 01:18:28.746]  They never did more than one.
[01:18:28.746 --> 01:18:30.567]  They know it destroys the troops.
[01:18:30.567 --> 01:18:32.168]  They know it hurts them.
[01:18:32.168 --> 01:18:36.291]  They give you deadly vaccines while saying you're going to be a terrorist later.
[01:18:36.291 --> 01:18:38.132]  Everything was to destroy you.
[01:18:38.132 --> 01:18:40.314]  I mean, are the guys seeing that now?
[01:18:42.646 --> 01:18:52.515]  And a lot of us believe that the anthrax shot we were given was some sort of other experimental shot, or even if it was the anthrax shot... No, it was experimental and it was a slow kill.
[01:18:52.515 --> 01:18:54.437]  I'm sorry to inform you.
[01:18:54.437 --> 01:18:54.937]  Okay, well...
[01:18:56.727 --> 01:19:00.728]  Anytime we ask questions, we don't ever get any answers on stuff like that.
[01:19:00.728 --> 01:19:06.729]  Um, when they gave us the anthrax shot, they would make us sit there for 20 to 30 minutes to see if we would have a severe reaction.
[01:19:06.729 --> 01:19:11.430]  Well, now soldiers are coming home and dying from these mysterious causes.
[01:19:11.430 --> 01:19:14.511]  And basically, it seems like they're just wiping us all out.
[01:19:14.511 --> 01:19:19.272]  And what they're going to do is bring in some other country to take over this country.
[01:19:19.472 --> 01:19:20.393]  No, they are.
[01:19:20.393 --> 01:19:21.835]  They've wiped us all out already.
[01:19:21.835 --> 01:19:23.236]  They've killed us culturally.
[01:19:23.236 --> 01:19:25.418]  I just can't believe this is actually happening.
[01:19:25.418 --> 01:19:30.183]  They're either just getting everybody acclimated to do this down the road, because they will fail.
[01:19:30.183 --> 01:19:33.647]  But then failing, it's more chaos, more death.
[01:19:33.647 --> 01:19:36.870]  If they go for the Civil War option, they could be getting ready to do it.
[01:19:40.410 --> 01:19:42.673]  I gotta go because he's in my area and he's on my...
[01:19:58.857 --> 01:20:00.198]  Alright, I'll talk to you during the break.
[01:20:00.198 --> 01:20:00.778]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:00.778 --> 01:20:01.759]  Aaron Fullin here.
[01:20:01.759 --> 01:20:13.266]  As the Food Police shut down food co-ops, the Amish, and small farmers, Americans are losing access, not just to raw milk and homemade cheeses, but to healthy, home-crafted sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut, yogurt, and kefir.
[01:20:13.266 --> 01:20:17.289]  It seems there's a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria.
[01:20:17.289 --> 01:20:20.031]  But frankly, I'm not sure what the Food Police are so afraid of.
[01:20:20.031 --> 01:20:27.596]  These remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history, with archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found across the globe in almost every culture.
[01:20:27.856 --> 01:20:35.605]  Even today, Japanese eat miso, Africans eat fermented porridges, Koreans eat kimchi, and in India, fermented milk is a staple for healthy living.
[01:20:35.605 --> 01:20:36.706]  But here's some good news.
[01:20:36.706 --> 01:20:42.533]  Self-reliant Americans can now discover the secrets to making these amazing fermented foods legally and privately in their own homes.
[01:20:42.893 --> 01:20:46.197]  Since it's still legal to make these foods as long as you can make them yourself.
[01:20:46.197 --> 01:20:49.020]  For more information check out fermentationfactor.com.
[01:20:49.020 --> 01:20:51.022]  That's fermentationfactor.com.
[01:20:51.022 --> 01:20:57.109]  It's easy to create your own powerful fermented foods and you can do it by going to www.fermentationfactor.com.
[01:20:57.109 --> 01:20:59.472]  That's www.fermentationfactor.com.
[01:21:01.417 --> 01:21:07.399]  Imagine waking one morning only to find your family shivering in the dark because you couldn't afford to pay your electric bill.
[01:21:07.399 --> 01:21:09.240]  That's closer than you think.
[01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:15.422]  You probably haven't heard about this yet because the liberal media has been suppressing what is fast becoming the most shocking news story of 2012.
[01:21:15.422 --> 01:21:24.165]  Obama's secret war on coal that could increase your already high power bill as much as 400% in coming months.
[01:21:24.165 --> 01:21:29.707]  As shocking as it sounds, it may well be just a matter of time before the lights start going out across America.
[01:21:30.447 --> 01:21:31.828]  But here's some good news.
[01:21:31.828 --> 01:21:41.315]  There's an underground video at exposed123.com that thousands of smart patriots have used to end their slavery to the corrupt electricity monopoly.
[01:21:41.315 --> 01:21:50.582]  The video at exposed123.com has already been banned by Google, and the liberal media is doing everything in its power to take it down and keep America in the dark.
[01:21:50.582 --> 01:21:54.785]  So watch it now at exposed123.com before it's too late.
[01:21:54.785 --> 01:21:56.286]  Again, that's exposed123.com.
[01:21:59.352 --> 01:22:00.132]  Gold.
[01:22:00.132 --> 01:22:01.673]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:22:01.673 --> 01:22:07.936]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:22:07.936 --> 01:22:12.118]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:22:12.118 --> 01:22:14.059]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:22:14.059 --> 01:22:16.500]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:24.104]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[01:22:24.144 --> 01:22:24.845]  We're good to go.
[01:22:52.728 --> 01:23:01.475]  You know what happens to your digestive health around the holidays?
[01:23:01.475 --> 01:23:02.056]  Right.
[01:23:02.056 --> 01:23:06.799]  Unusual schedules and foods you don't normally eat can cause upset stomach and indigestion.

[01:24:08.863 --> 01:24:14.768]  I was talking to my reporter, some of them pretty seasoned back there, and they said that it is time to go public.
[01:24:14.768 --> 01:24:19.131]  If you defend the Republic, if you believe in defeating these people, you've got to fight in the info war.
[01:24:19.131 --> 01:24:21.373]  90% of war is information.
[01:24:21.373 --> 01:24:23.175]  We have the moral high ground.
[01:24:23.175 --> 01:24:34.284]  When you're being taught to confiscate guns and being taught that people that are prepared, like Mormons and Amish and people, that's who they're targeting, Christians, conservatives, libertarians, when you're being taught they're the enemy.
[01:24:35.117 --> 01:24:37.480]  Folks, that is Soviet Union, man.
[01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:39.122]  That is so bad.
[01:24:39.122 --> 01:24:41.684]  And believe me, I'm at the top of the list here.
[01:24:41.684 --> 01:24:42.706]  I'm getting chills right now.
[01:24:43.763 --> 01:24:46.484]  But I'm just like, hey, praise God, I've done the right thing.
[01:24:46.484 --> 01:24:47.284]  I've been right.
[01:24:47.284 --> 01:24:48.545]  I've studied this.
[01:24:48.545 --> 01:24:51.166]  We're trying to stop this as best we can.
[01:24:51.166 --> 01:24:52.527]  We need to pray for this country.
[01:24:52.527 --> 01:24:55.388]  We need to pray for those that have been steadfast and have tried to be good.
[01:24:55.388 --> 01:24:57.669]  We need to pray to avert this.
[01:24:57.669 --> 01:25:02.331]  But, you know, then I think, well, this country's killed 52 million babies in abortion.
[01:25:02.331 --> 01:25:03.731]  This country's been the heart of the empire.
[01:25:03.731 --> 01:25:05.212]  And of course, we're going to be brought down for it.
[01:25:06.876 --> 01:25:08.858]  It's just look at how they destroy the troops.
[01:25:08.858 --> 01:25:10.379]  Everything they do is to hurt them.
[01:25:10.379 --> 01:25:11.940]  Everything they do is to demonize them.
[01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:14.122]  They give them deadly, illegal anthrax shots.
[01:25:14.122 --> 01:25:16.123]  It's illegal to give that experimental shot.
[01:25:16.123 --> 01:25:16.884]  That's come out in court.
[01:25:16.884 --> 01:25:18.425]  They just keep doing it.
[01:25:18.425 --> 01:25:24.750]  They gave them experimental smallpox shots, but it killed so many, they had to stop it a few years ago.
[01:25:24.750 --> 01:25:30.214]  And they just do this to these people while finding the ones that'll shoot at Americans.
[01:25:30.214 --> 01:25:31.495]  Just like TSA.
[01:25:31.495 --> 01:25:34.458]  It's there to find people that'll grab old ladies' genitals.
[01:25:35.845 --> 01:25:47.593]  They're creating an army of idiots, and evil people, and control freaks, and perverts, and they just can't find a lot in the military ranks, even though a lot of poor people and stuff join the military.
[01:25:47.593 --> 01:25:54.138]  They still, you know, people know they can be killed doing it, so you still get some good people in the military, because they're people that have courage.
[01:25:54.138 --> 01:25:57.480]  And even if you're silly and ignorant, you've got guts, and guts is enough.
[01:25:57.480 --> 01:25:59.002]  To quote Full Metal Jacket, and it's true.
[01:26:00.066 --> 01:26:01.267]  And you know what?
[01:26:01.267 --> 01:26:02.789]  It's time to codify your facts.
[01:26:02.789 --> 01:26:03.990]  It's time to go public.
[01:26:03.990 --> 01:26:06.992]  Then they'll call you in and threaten to court-martial you if you don't shut up.
[01:26:06.992 --> 01:26:07.893]  Then everybody shuts up.
[01:26:07.893 --> 01:26:09.054]  But by then it's already out.
[01:26:09.054 --> 01:26:16.561]  It's time for all the officers that aren't total scum and for the enlisted people and the non-commissioned officers and others.
[01:26:16.561 --> 01:26:20.344]  I mean, to speak out and to say no to this.
[01:26:20.344 --> 01:26:21.986]  I mean, here's the Washington Times right here.
[01:26:21.986 --> 01:26:25.309]  Napolitano stands by controversial report.
[01:26:26.690 --> 01:26:32.614]  Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said Wednesday that she was briefed before the release of the controversial intelligence assessment.
[01:26:32.614 --> 01:26:34.015]  We released that.
[01:26:34.015 --> 01:26:38.679]  And that she stands by the report which lists returning veterans among terrorist risk to the U.S.
[01:26:39.943 --> 01:26:41.204]  That was April 16, 2009.
[01:26:41.204 --> 01:26:42.745]  Okay?
[01:26:42.745 --> 01:26:45.547]  Now, we've released, I don't know, probably 20 of these reports over the years.
[01:26:45.547 --> 01:26:49.751]  We've been given by FBI, Federal Marshals, State Police, Military, you name it.
[01:26:49.751 --> 01:26:53.173]  And people always go, that can't be real until they admit it's real.
[01:26:53.173 --> 01:27:00.559]  Since then, we've gotten re-education camp documents that the Army responded to and said, yeah, those are real, you're not supposed to have those.
[01:27:01.601 --> 01:27:03.782]  And then they released it.
[01:27:03.782 --> 01:27:10.965]  It's like Ted Turner saying, I think troops should commit suicide on CNN two days ago, and it's not even a news issue.
[01:27:10.965 --> 01:27:12.706]  We're that broken.
[01:27:12.706 --> 01:27:16.648]  We'll put up with anything now.
[01:27:16.648 --> 01:27:18.629]  We're going to go to break, and I want to hear from military.
[01:27:18.629 --> 01:27:21.170]  I want to hear from police.
[01:27:21.170 --> 01:27:22.650]  And I'll try to go to you as quickly as possible.
[01:27:22.650 --> 01:27:23.211]  Make your statement.
[01:27:23.211 --> 01:27:25.672]  Go to the next person, because I'm bad about asking 50 questions.
[01:27:27.438 --> 01:27:29.021]  Look, you gotta choose a side here.
[01:27:29.021 --> 01:27:31.826]  I mean, this is a master plan to take over.
[01:27:31.826 --> 01:27:33.529]  I studied history.
[01:27:33.529 --> 01:27:37.536]  It's an amalgamation of what every authoritarian has done in the last hundred years.
[01:27:37.536 --> 01:27:39.219]  I mean, it gives me chills.
[01:27:39.219 --> 01:27:40.541]  I'm getting chills right now.
[01:27:42.697 --> 01:27:43.738]  Makes me grind my teeth.
[01:27:43.738 --> 01:27:44.539]  I don't normally do that.
[01:27:44.539 --> 01:27:45.900]  It makes me clench my teeth.
[01:27:45.900 --> 01:27:46.840]  It is so real.
[01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:48.221]  It is so authoritarian.
[01:27:48.221 --> 01:27:49.122]  It is so bad.
[01:27:49.122 --> 01:27:57.108]  If they're able to execute this, if they pull the trigger on this, man, it is, we're going to enter hell on earth.
[01:27:57.108 --> 01:27:59.050]  We're talking civil war.
[01:27:59.050 --> 01:28:00.591]  They're going to brand as a revolution.
[01:28:00.591 --> 01:28:02.273]  They're going to break up the U.S.
[01:28:02.273 --> 01:28:08.818]  They're going to bring in foreign troops after the military and the police go into this war against the American people.
[01:28:09.983 --> 01:28:10.844]  And it's targeted.
[01:28:10.844 --> 01:28:15.026]  They're going to have us, the patriots, long knife the police and military.
[01:28:15.026 --> 01:28:17.968]  Don't be part of this, you idiots.
[01:28:17.968 --> 01:28:21.490]  Especially arrogant police that think it's fun to be a tyrant.
[01:28:21.490 --> 01:28:23.731]  It's not going to be fun once the gloves come off.
[01:28:23.731 --> 01:28:25.652]  We do not want to go here.
[01:28:25.652 --> 01:28:26.293]  We do not.
[01:28:26.673 --> 01:28:27.754]  Want to have this happen.
[01:28:27.754 --> 01:28:45.424]  They've got fake anonymous groups and others and talk show hosts and others who are being able to say things on air and things that I know they're agents like Hal Turner calling for violent storming of the White House, calling for killing, calling for bombing government buildings in the name of patriots right now, the day before the election.
[01:28:46.104 --> 01:28:47.464]  That's all being pushed right now.
[01:28:47.464 --> 01:28:49.525]  They're trying to get something going right now.
[01:28:49.525 --> 01:28:51.765]  You've heard the police call in, and we later confirmed it in St.
[01:28:51.765 --> 01:28:51.985]  Louis.
[01:28:51.985 --> 01:28:55.526]  They're telling them, after the election, get ready for total collapse.
[01:28:55.526 --> 01:28:57.826]  I don't know that's a foregone conclusion.
[01:28:57.826 --> 01:29:01.107]  We can stop this if we get the word out.
[01:29:01.107 --> 01:29:10.089]  But I'm telling you, the enemy is testing everything right now, and if they think they can win a civil war, or if they think they can execute this, and if they think you're going to roll over,
[01:29:11.431 --> 01:29:18.395]  Like Lindsey Williams said, hey, if we roll over to these tests without getting really angry and vocal, they're gonna pull the trigger.
[01:29:18.395 --> 01:29:21.657]  Every other country's been overrun and taken over by authoritarians.
[01:29:21.657 --> 01:29:23.758]  Every country in the last hundred years.
[01:29:23.758 --> 01:29:25.779]  And they line people up and blow their heads off.
[01:29:25.779 --> 01:29:29.361]  They rape and kill your wife and daughters.
[01:29:29.361 --> 01:29:31.142]  Or put them in slave camps.
[01:29:31.142 --> 01:29:33.663]  And I'm not going along with this.
[01:29:33.663 --> 01:29:33.944]  Okay?
[01:29:35.031 --> 01:29:36.731]  Now thank God we're American.
[01:29:36.731 --> 01:29:40.752]  Thank God our founders enshrined that Second Amendment in a fighting spirit.
[01:29:40.752 --> 01:29:43.413]  That's the one thing we've got these other countries didn't have.
[01:29:43.413 --> 01:29:46.594]  That's the one thing the globalists, one thing gives them pause is that.
[01:29:46.594 --> 01:29:46.914]  800-259-9231.
[01:29:46.914 --> 01:29:47.414]  We're on the march.
[01:29:47.414 --> 01:29:48.094]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:48.094 --> 01:29:49.014]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:33:40.006 --> 01:33:41.308]  Central Standard Time.
[01:33:41.308 --> 01:33:42.609]  We are here live.
[01:33:42.609 --> 01:33:44.631]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[01:33:46.072 --> 01:33:47.132]  Look at what we already put up with.
[01:33:47.132 --> 01:33:50.773]  The TSA takes your children to private rooms and take their clothes off.
[01:33:50.773 --> 01:33:53.234]  They stick their hands in your pants.
[01:33:53.234 --> 01:33:54.814]  There's checkpoints all over the country.
[01:33:54.814 --> 01:33:58.335]  The IRS takes houses without even a jury trial or anything.
[01:33:58.335 --> 01:34:03.956]  They announce on the news, world government has conquered the United States.
[01:34:03.956 --> 01:34:08.277]  We are going deeper and deeper and deeper into classical authoritarianism.
[01:34:08.277 --> 01:34:11.477]  I could go on for hours, all the examples of corruption and tyranny.
[01:34:11.477 --> 01:34:13.998]  You know, yesterday I called the Austin City Council criminal.
[01:34:15.772 --> 01:34:23.218]  And, you know, I was talking about how most cities are run by people that just engage in all sorts of inside deals, all sorts of things.
[01:34:23.218 --> 01:34:28.702]  And here it is today, and then I'll get into the really big news in your phone calls.
[01:34:28.702 --> 01:34:39.771]  Out of the Austin American Statesman, KXAN, you name it, city council warned on open meetings violation, county attorney agrees to defer prosecution.
[01:34:41.073 --> 01:34:48.580]  And for over a decade, they meet in secret, they give each other business deals, they do all sorts of sweetheart deals.
[01:34:48.580 --> 01:34:53.024]  I mean, it's like Chicago or New York or something, and they just break everybody's will.
[01:34:53.024 --> 01:35:02.132]  And of course, it turns out that the attorneys that work for the city and the county, they've been in little meetings with people and have made their own little good old boy deals.
[01:35:02.132 --> 01:35:03.334]  And now nobody gets in trouble.
[01:35:04.244 --> 01:35:06.165]  Or thousands of meetings.
[01:35:06.165 --> 01:35:14.451]  Oh, and they spent half a million dollars on outside law firms to certify it was okay for them to not get in trouble.
[01:35:14.451 --> 01:35:17.553]  So just everything is shucking us dry.
[01:35:17.553 --> 01:35:20.074]  Everything is a giant scam.
[01:35:20.074 --> 01:35:28.360]  And here in Austin, they just come and take people's property, pay them in some cases nothing, call it an environmental preserve, and they don't even wait five years now.
[01:35:28.360 --> 01:35:31.602]  In two years, they turn around and sell it and take the restrictions off.
[01:35:32.250 --> 01:35:42.694]  And then they have former mayors and people that own the banks that you've got to go to to get the building money if you want the restrictions taken off.
[01:35:42.694 --> 01:35:45.215]  I mean, it's just absolutely a joke.
[01:35:45.215 --> 01:35:52.398]  They've certified our elections at the state level, are fraudulent where I live, we're a UN model city.
[01:35:52.398 --> 01:35:53.839]  It's a joke.
[01:35:53.839 --> 01:35:54.399]  It's a joke.
[01:35:54.399 --> 01:35:57.261]  People have to realize we don't vote in Travis County.
[01:35:57.261 --> 01:35:58.961]  That's why it's so criminal.
[01:35:58.961 --> 01:36:00.142]  That's why they do whatever they want.
[01:36:01.055 --> 01:36:03.056]  We've got to realize how much trouble we're in.
[01:36:03.056 --> 01:36:06.757]  And I know you're listening all over the country and all over the world.
[01:36:06.757 --> 01:36:10.699]  I know the similar stuff's going on in your area.
[01:36:10.699 --> 01:36:13.100]  And they've said, yes, they violated the law.
[01:36:13.100 --> 01:36:14.920]  I mean, they could be in jail for years.
[01:36:14.920 --> 01:36:16.241]  Huge fines.
[01:36:16.241 --> 01:36:18.662]  But they're going to defer that.
[01:36:18.662 --> 01:36:20.202]  And they're not going to get in trouble.
[01:36:20.202 --> 01:36:21.183]  So there you go.
[01:36:21.183 --> 01:36:23.604]  KXAN.
[01:36:23.604 --> 01:36:26.505]  Again, that's why we're in so much trouble.
[01:36:26.505 --> 01:36:28.585]  Because these people get away with anything and everything.
[01:36:28.585 --> 01:36:29.406]  Now, I want to hear
[01:36:31.155 --> 01:36:39.122]  What you have to say about this if you're active duty military or police or a security contractor, because I know you've all been told this.
[01:36:39.122 --> 01:36:48.530]  I mean, everything that military man was just telling us, I already have in the news articles with links to where they admit preppers being put on no-fly list.
[01:36:48.530 --> 01:36:54.655]  Famous preppers from TV shows with no criminal record go get grabbed and thrown in jail and everything taken.
[01:36:54.655 --> 01:36:55.556]  No judge, no jury.
[01:36:56.738 --> 01:36:59.159]  They have a civilian inmate labor camp program.
[01:36:59.159 --> 01:37:00.599]  I've been to the urban drills.
[01:37:00.599 --> 01:37:04.161]  They admit they're training the Boy Scouts and others for gun confiscation.
[01:37:04.161 --> 01:37:06.702]  I've got the New York Times saying how great it is.
[01:37:06.702 --> 01:37:14.384]  I've got the new Army manual saying, preparing on how to lock down cities and move in incrementally, street by street, and take the guns.
[01:37:14.384 --> 01:37:20.887]  How to announce, turn your guns in, get your new government ID card, and you won't go to the FEMA camp.
[01:37:20.887 --> 01:37:22.427]  I mean, they're going to make examples of people.
[01:37:24.622 --> 01:37:27.083]  What's terrible about this is you can't go to the FEMA camp.
[01:37:27.083 --> 01:37:29.965]  You have to resist this criminal takeover.
[01:37:29.965 --> 01:37:33.427]  This is Red Dawn that they're thinking about pulling on us completely.
[01:37:33.427 --> 01:37:35.728]  Not slow motion anymore, but hot.
[01:37:35.728 --> 01:37:46.154]  But then, even when you fight back, you're fighting back against poor, soft-kill victims full of deadly vaccines that drink fluoride and who are scared themselves and been ordered to do it.
[01:37:46.154 --> 01:37:47.475]  But it's just the way it is.
[01:37:49.401 --> 01:37:51.562]  And, you know, I just wish we could arrest Ted Turner.
[01:37:51.562 --> 01:37:54.023]  He's part of all sorts of crimes with the UN.
[01:37:54.023 --> 01:37:55.804]  And I've got a stack of news articles right here.
[01:37:55.804 --> 01:37:56.884]  Sunday Times of London.
[01:37:56.884 --> 01:37:59.485]  Billionaire club in bid to curb overpopulation.
[01:37:59.485 --> 01:38:02.046]  All their programs put stuff in the vaccines and the water.
[01:38:02.046 --> 01:38:03.346]  Wall Street Journal.
[01:38:03.346 --> 01:38:07.768]  Millionaires try to shrink world's population, report says, in secret meetings.
[01:38:07.768 --> 01:38:08.588]  World Net Daily.
[01:38:08.588 --> 01:38:11.009]  Secret billionaire club seeks population control.
[01:38:11.009 --> 01:38:12.170]  And then I got Ecoscience.
[01:38:12.870 --> 01:38:18.155]  Where they talked about the plan in the 70s to spike the air and water to sterilize us and kill us and now they're doing it.
[01:38:18.155 --> 01:38:22.199]  Everything they talk about in this book, they were already implementing then.
[01:38:22.199 --> 01:38:23.320]  When was this written?
[01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:25.382]  1970, I forget the date here.
[01:38:25.382 --> 01:38:26.763]  You think I'm joking?
[01:38:26.763 --> 01:38:27.704]  Ecoscience.
[01:38:27.704 --> 01:38:28.645]  It's online, read it.
[01:38:28.645 --> 01:38:30.447]  It's free.
[01:38:30.447 --> 01:38:31.107]  People scanned it.
[01:38:31.107 --> 01:38:31.388]  1970.
[01:38:31.388 --> 01:38:32.869]  This is an updated 1977.
[01:38:32.869 --> 01:38:33.189]  There you go.
[01:38:38.208 --> 01:38:40.669]  I mean, I'm sorry reality's so crazy.
[01:38:40.669 --> 01:38:49.411]  Stalin killing 50 million, Lenin killing 25 million, Hitler killing 20 million, Mao killing 60 plus million, Pol Pot killing 30% of the Cambodians.
[01:38:49.411 --> 01:38:54.673]  I mean, this is the way it works.
[01:38:54.673 --> 01:38:57.234]  Illuminati French Revolution, over a million killed.
[01:38:59.124 --> 01:39:09.772]  This is what governments do, and if we don't get back to our forefathers who said we'll look out for this, who said you need guns to protect yourself from this, who said you better keep local control, it's all over.
[01:39:09.772 --> 01:39:17.178]  Toll free number to join us, 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[01:39:17.178 --> 01:39:20.580]  But again, if you're a new listener, go look it up.
[01:39:20.580 --> 01:39:27.766]  They have said publicly for three and a half years veterans are the number one terror threat, and that's what the troops and police trained to fight.
[01:39:29.778 --> 01:39:32.720]  Now, they're saying that because they know you're not going to go along.
[01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:43.448]  They know a lot of you have killed people, or been around it, and you've got guilt over wars and stuff, and they know you're not going to go along with the New World Order.
[01:39:43.448 --> 01:39:48.672]  Well, they plan to use the current military and police to cut you down and kill you.
[01:39:48.672 --> 01:39:50.513]  That's why they're putting veterans on no-fly list.
[01:39:50.513 --> 01:39:53.075]  Veterans with no criminal records can't buy guns in many cases now.
[01:39:54.065 --> 01:39:58.107]  And all the military and police doing this, you're going to be on that list next too.
[01:39:58.107 --> 01:40:00.628]  It's time to just say no to this!
[01:40:00.628 --> 01:40:02.248]  Is there no orders you won't follow?
[01:40:02.248 --> 01:40:03.229]  Is there nothing you won't do?
[01:40:03.229 --> 01:40:10.252]  I'm going to shut up and go to Ken, Alan, Josh, and many others, but I want to hear from police and military right now.
[01:40:10.252 --> 01:40:13.253]  Or are people too scared and are just going to do whatever the new old order says?
[01:40:13.253 --> 01:40:18.015]  Because it'll get more and more hellish until you're the one lined up getting shot in the pit by your bosses.
[01:40:18.015 --> 01:40:18.595]  800-259-9231.
[01:40:18.595 --> 01:40:18.915]  It is tyranny
[01:40:24.477 --> 01:40:26.599]  And it's takeover program that we're witnessing.
[01:40:26.599 --> 01:40:28.320]  If we give in to fear, they win.
[01:40:28.320 --> 01:40:30.903]  If we get back in their face, they go back in their holes.
[01:40:30.903 --> 01:40:33.385]  You gotta back them off.
[01:40:33.385 --> 01:40:37.328]  We've got a bunch of recent army, ex-navy, private sector security.
[01:40:37.328 --> 01:40:38.769]  I want to hear from police and military.
[01:40:38.769 --> 01:40:38.809]  800-259-9231.
[01:40:42.273 --> 01:40:44.094]  Are you going to follow orders to take guns?
[01:40:44.094 --> 01:40:50.099]  Are you going to follow orders to try to go and attack gun owners and people that know the New World Order is taking over?
[01:40:50.099 --> 01:40:54.021]  Are you going to collaborate with the New World Order out of just pure cowardice?
[01:40:54.021 --> 01:40:55.342]  Are you really that cowardly?
[01:40:55.342 --> 01:41:02.267]  Did they psychologically profile you when they hired you to be a coward so they know you will serve pure evil to the end?
[01:41:02.267 --> 01:41:02.947]  800-259-9231.
[01:41:02.947 --> 01:41:06.410]  Are you getting similar information?
[01:41:06.410 --> 01:41:10.273]  Alan, who's private sector security, give us your quick take.
[01:41:10.273 --> 01:41:10.613]  Go ahead.
[01:41:12.330 --> 01:41:14.732]  I'm taking my call.
[01:41:14.732 --> 01:41:20.295]  What I'm seeing here, they're keeping it pretty quiet in the security sector.
[01:41:20.295 --> 01:41:24.418]  My grandfather's an intelligence and he's bounced some ideas off of me as well.
[01:41:24.418 --> 01:41:30.342]  What he has told me is what he sees happening is more of a modern day siege warfare.
[01:41:30.342 --> 01:41:34.004]  The idea is really kind of to sit back, let people run out of supplies.
[01:41:35.013 --> 01:41:38.636]  He knows that that's going to break loose with chaos.
[01:41:38.636 --> 01:41:43.280]  You're going to see people, it's going to be looting, rioting, shootings.
[01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:47.763]  People are going to run out of food and they're going to come to the military for help.
[01:41:47.763 --> 01:41:55.289]  And then Homeland Security, well that's what the military man was just telling us, our source, Mr. X, Soldier X. No, that's the plan.
[01:41:55.289 --> 01:41:58.912]  And then those of us that do have some food and water and guns, we're terrorists.
[01:41:59.392 --> 01:42:06.078]  They're going to tell the public they've got food, they're terrorists, and the general yuppie scum will cheer as we're being hung at sports stadiums.
[01:42:06.078 --> 01:42:07.499]  I'm telling you.
[01:42:07.499 --> 01:42:08.500]  Exactly.
[01:42:08.500 --> 01:42:15.465]  And what he's seeing is, you know, what they're going to do is they're going to let all this happen for, you know, five or six months.
[01:42:15.465 --> 01:42:18.848]  And the military is going to lay back, let it all happen.
[01:42:18.848 --> 01:42:19.889]  And through the chaos,
[01:42:20.436 --> 01:42:29.567]  After everyone starts running out of ammo, because there's people storing thousands of rounds, and you know, as someone who's done a lot of shooting, thousands of rounds can run out very quickly.
[01:42:29.567 --> 01:42:33.411]  Once all this stuff starts running out, all these people are going to be begging for help.
[01:42:33.411 --> 01:42:35.373]  And that's when the military is going to roll in.
[01:42:35.373 --> 01:42:37.235]  And when this happens... That's what they're doing!
[01:42:37.235 --> 01:42:41.060]  The Euro admits they're imploding that to totally have them go under EU dictatorship.
[01:42:41.620 --> 01:42:47.247]  The countries are being forced to sign over their final sovereignty, and have you seen the new EU sign?
[01:42:47.247 --> 01:42:49.771]  Kurt Nemo wrote about this on the official EU site.
[01:42:49.771 --> 01:42:55.057]  It's a giant star with a hammer and sickle at the top, with hammers and sickles all over it.
[01:42:55.057 --> 01:42:56.819]  I mean, hammers and sickles!
[01:42:56.819 --> 01:42:58.622]  I mean, what more do we need here?
[01:42:59.648 --> 01:43:00.529]  Exactly.
[01:43:00.529 --> 01:43:06.933]  And what this is going to do, this is going to give the troops kind of the moral high ground when they roll in because they're going to think, oh, we're just running and trying to help.
[01:43:06.933 --> 01:43:08.434]  That's exactly what they did in Katrina.
[01:43:08.434 --> 01:43:11.636]  They didn't run into Katrina immediately as soon as things set off.
[01:43:11.636 --> 01:43:12.176]  They waited.
[01:43:12.176 --> 01:43:14.277]  They laid back for things to get crazy.
[01:43:14.277 --> 01:43:17.880]  And then a lot of the troops were thinking, well, you know, if we're taking guns, we're helping people.
[01:43:18.562 --> 01:43:22.267]  Exactly, and they sat there and jammed the police communication so things would break down.
[01:43:22.267 --> 01:43:23.969]  I appreciate your call.
[01:43:23.969 --> 01:43:26.612]  A lot of times we get a lot of current military and police calling in.
[01:43:26.612 --> 01:43:28.754]  We're not getting that right now.
[01:43:28.754 --> 01:43:33.660]  We've got recent Army, Josh in Florida, then Ken, Guy, Dave, and others.
[01:43:33.660 --> 01:43:34.581]  Josh, you're on the air.
[01:43:34.581 --> 01:43:36.043]  What's your take on what we're breaking down here?
[01:43:37.182 --> 01:43:42.664]  Hi Alex, yeah, I just want to say I've called you before and I'll contact you about being an Iraq veteran.
[01:43:42.664 --> 01:43:44.765]  We use naked body scanners in Iraq.
[01:43:44.765 --> 01:43:46.045]  We use the Pat Jones.
[01:43:46.045 --> 01:43:47.606]  We use all that stuff.
[01:43:47.606 --> 01:43:48.546]  And that's coming over here.
[01:43:48.546 --> 01:43:55.648]  No, MIT said this was the model and it would be in America that we're going to live, like living in America will be like living in Fallujah.
[01:43:55.648 --> 01:43:56.949]  I mean, this is what it's going to be like.
[01:43:56.949 --> 01:43:58.709]  You go to the grocery store, they're going to grope you there.
[01:43:58.709 --> 01:44:02.051]  You give them a problem, they're going to spray bullets into you up against the wall.
[01:44:02.051 --> 01:44:02.891]  This is the takeover.
[01:44:03.814 --> 01:44:05.855]  Yes, and I want to verify a couple of things you've been mentioning.
[01:44:05.855 --> 01:44:07.016]  Yes, you're right, it's military.
[01:44:07.016 --> 01:44:09.517]  I could definitely see the reason why we're such a threat.
[01:44:09.517 --> 01:44:11.398]  We've been trained how to shoot.
[01:44:11.398 --> 01:44:12.799]  We're physically fit.
[01:44:12.799 --> 01:44:14.460]  We have first aid training.
[01:44:14.460 --> 01:44:16.181]  We're trained in urban warfare.
[01:44:16.181 --> 01:44:18.642]  We're trained in how to collect intelligence and how to report it.
[01:44:18.642 --> 01:44:22.444]  So, yes, and I feel guilty being in the Iraq War.
[01:44:22.444 --> 01:44:24.145]  I have to come back from it.
[01:44:24.145 --> 01:44:31.970]  I went to occupy Miami for months with the end of wars and the feds time because I was so pissed off about it because I felt so upset by it.
[01:44:32.310 --> 01:44:32.931]  We're good to go.
[01:44:48.601 --> 01:44:50.102]  Well, that's what I'm telling you.
[01:44:50.102 --> 01:44:51.943]  We're different because of the Second Amendment.
[01:44:51.943 --> 01:44:58.466]  We may be able to stop this, but the globalists say, hey, they got a Second Amendment, let's just collapse it, let them kill each other.
[01:44:58.466 --> 01:45:01.508]  It is just so horrible.
[01:45:01.508 --> 01:45:03.809]  And we've got to have military and police start speaking out now.
[01:45:04.309 --> 01:45:09.953]  If enough people start speaking out, even anonymously, it'll gain critical mass and we can back this off.
[01:45:09.953 --> 01:45:11.554]  We've got power if we use it.
[01:45:11.554 --> 01:45:13.615]  Good to hear from you.
[01:45:13.615 --> 01:45:17.038]  Let's go to Ken in Minnesota, former Navy.
[01:45:17.038 --> 01:45:18.298]  Give us your quick take on that.
[01:45:18.298 --> 01:45:19.359]  Go ahead.
[01:45:19.359 --> 01:45:20.300]  Hello, Alex.
[01:45:20.300 --> 01:45:22.281]  Long time listener.
[01:45:22.281 --> 01:45:24.182]  God bless you and your staff for the work that you're doing.
[01:45:24.182 --> 01:45:25.003]  You're true patriots.
[01:45:27.376 --> 01:45:32.801]  And for your staff and for your listeners, I want you to all listen real close because this is going to ring a bell here.
[01:45:32.801 --> 01:45:37.124]  Mike Adams sat in for you, Alex, back on August 6th.
[01:45:37.124 --> 01:45:41.948]  And I recall Mike talking about how they want to make the veterans look like the bad guy.
[01:45:41.948 --> 01:45:45.171]  He was so really right and so correct about that.
[01:45:45.171 --> 01:45:56.680]  On Monday, August 13th, 2012, this year, the TV series Major Crimes, which is an offshoot from The Closer on the TNT Network,
[01:45:57.185 --> 01:46:02.109]  Premiered its first episode and it was from 9 to 10 subject time.
[01:46:02.109 --> 01:46:11.758]  Just a week after Mike Adams brought the subject up on the veterans being the villains, the TNT network allowed this trash to be seen by the public.
[01:46:11.758 --> 01:46:15.701]  It was a, I was an honorary discharge veteran.
[01:46:15.701 --> 01:46:17.303]  I was pretty curious about this.
[01:46:18.271 --> 01:46:31.119]  And I've just noticed as I get on... Sir, they've got more than 10 new TV shows, ABC, NBC, CBS, TNT, all of them, where veterans are murdering terrorists that hurt children.
[01:46:31.119 --> 01:46:32.820]  And the police come and take them out.
[01:46:32.820 --> 01:46:34.701]  And the good military comes and takes them out.
[01:46:34.701 --> 01:46:38.183]  And they show the public now, we're going to have a war with the veterans.
[01:46:38.183 --> 01:46:40.925]  Just like before 9-11, they had TV shows about Al-Qaeda.
[01:46:41.565 --> 01:46:49.309]  I'm telling you, this is how, it's either, they are preparing the minds, prepping the minds for a civil war.
[01:46:49.309 --> 01:46:54.992]  And the average cops, just like the general public, so dumbed down, they're like, well if it's on TV, veterans are bad, you know?
[01:46:54.992 --> 01:46:56.613]  Go ahead, I'm sorry.
[01:46:56.613 --> 01:47:06.779]  Yeah, uh, anyways, uh, and if anybody wants any more proof of that, if you have, like, on demand, uh, all you gotta do is punch in on demand, look up... What do they do on the show?
[01:47:08.420 --> 01:47:20.070]  They showed these guys coming into a town there and they're just blasting up a bank and all this and they're digging into it and digging into it and it outright makes the veteran look like the bad guy.
[01:47:20.070 --> 01:47:20.550]  Of course!
[01:47:20.550 --> 01:47:22.732]  They admit the government pays for that.
[01:47:22.732 --> 01:47:26.855]  They pay for pro-Obama messages, pro-government-run healthcare messages.
[01:47:26.855 --> 01:47:29.318]  I mean, we live... They really want to take over.
[01:47:29.318 --> 01:47:30.899]  They think they can do it.
[01:47:30.899 --> 01:47:31.760]  With a civil war.
[01:47:31.760 --> 01:47:34.782]  It's like they're starting a C.I.C.I.C.I.C.I.C.I.C.I.C.I.C.I.C.I.C.I.C.I.C.I.C.I.C.I.C.I.C.I.C.I.C.I.C.I.C.I.C.I.C.I.C.I.C.I.C.I.C.I.C.I.C.I.C.I.C.I.C
[01:47:36.560 --> 01:47:46.689]  Again, we normally can load the phones up with police and military, current, who call in and speak out against all this, or can confirm some of the things we're talking about or deny it.
[01:47:46.689 --> 01:47:49.852]  I already know it's all true.
[01:47:49.852 --> 01:47:51.413]  Is there no order?
[01:47:51.413 --> 01:47:53.575]  Police, would you kill your children of order to?
[01:47:53.575 --> 01:47:54.596]  Probably, some of you.
[01:47:54.596 --> 01:47:56.798]  I mean, that's where this goes.
[01:47:56.798 --> 01:48:00.081]  Would you send your daddy to the FEMA camp because he doesn't love the New World Order?
[01:48:01.669 --> 01:48:02.650]  I mean, that's the question.
[01:48:02.650 --> 01:48:02.730]  800-259-9231.
[01:48:02.730 --> 01:48:08.432]  I know we've got the phones loaded with former military and police.
[01:48:08.432 --> 01:48:10.292]  I want to hear from Current.
[01:48:10.292 --> 01:48:11.533]  I'm not knocking all these people.
[01:48:11.533 --> 01:48:14.134]  I just want to hear from Current.
[01:48:14.134 --> 01:48:17.795]  Dave in Florida, ex-Air Force, then ex-Army, ex-Marine.
[01:48:17.795 --> 01:48:18.535]  God bless you, sir.
[01:48:18.535 --> 01:48:18.876]  Go ahead.
[01:48:18.876 --> 01:48:19.836]  What's your take on all this?
[01:48:21.053 --> 01:48:23.834]  I'm Air Force retired.
[01:48:23.834 --> 01:48:33.058]  I was a contractor for Northrop Grumman for about six to eight years and I'd like to back up what that soldier said.
[01:48:33.058 --> 01:48:40.261]  I've been purged out of the system also because I believed in the New World Order and I would speak out against it.
[01:48:40.261 --> 01:48:43.203]  So I've been unemployed for over three years.
[01:48:43.203 --> 01:48:50.266]  So like when you see them announce on TV that they're setting up world government you would speak out against it and they said that doesn't exist you're fired?
[01:48:51.707 --> 01:48:54.348]  No, they didn't fire me.
[01:48:54.348 --> 01:48:57.009]  They laid us off and they terminated the contract.
[01:48:57.009 --> 01:49:02.170]  Well, you know, they build a lot of the components now in China and places, so they don't need you anymore.
[01:49:02.170 --> 01:49:03.190]  Well, that's true.
[01:49:03.190 --> 01:49:11.073]  And I worked in weapons systems, so I did a job that I monitored a lot of stuff and
[01:49:13.137 --> 01:49:23.145]  I worked with radar, basically, and I'm in the Gulf of Mexico, and we could trace every aircraft that flew in the United States.
[01:49:23.145 --> 01:49:25.566]  They have a program that traces this.
[01:49:25.566 --> 01:49:27.448]  Many people don't know this.
[01:49:27.448 --> 01:49:29.930]  For 9-11, all that is bullshit.
[01:49:31.331 --> 01:49:33.052]  You can tell we have a lot of military callers here.
[01:49:33.052 --> 01:49:34.012]  The cuss words are flying.
[01:49:34.012 --> 01:49:35.013]  We have to delay that out.
[01:49:35.013 --> 01:49:38.695]  Yes, we understand it's, uh, Bravo Sierra, or how do you say it?
[01:49:38.695 --> 01:49:40.716]  Oh, we don't need any more of that.
[01:49:40.716 --> 01:49:44.878]  Yeah, of course, they ordered the transponders off, turned them all off.
[01:49:44.878 --> 01:49:48.600]  They're all hardwired, is what you're saying, and it's pure baloney.
[01:49:48.600 --> 01:49:58.605]  What I did was, when aircraft crashed, I sent the rescue planes to find them, because, you know, when their transponder stops, we send out aircraft to find them.
[01:49:59.381 --> 01:50:04.024]  Like the Hendricks Motors thing that crashed in Alabama.
[01:50:04.024 --> 01:50:06.125]  Well, I think they're going to crash the dollar first.
[01:50:16.917 --> 01:50:27.846]  And then the people will do whatever they have to because in Katrina, which I've seen, they, you know, cut off the food and water supply and the power and then they can control the people.
[01:50:27.846 --> 01:50:30.048]  They'll control the highways.
[01:50:30.048 --> 01:50:38.494]  I also went after the military and I wanted to get into emergency management training because I wanted to help people.
[01:50:38.494 --> 01:50:43.999]  And when I found out that they did all this stuff and took control of the people, I couldn't do it anymore.
[01:50:43.999 --> 01:50:45.900]  I also went and trained for TSA.
[01:50:47.859 --> 01:50:55.581]  Passed all the stuff, and then when they gave me the questionnaire, I was never given an interview, because I wouldn't molest people.
[01:50:55.581 --> 01:50:56.021]  That's right.
[01:50:56.021 --> 01:50:56.601]  No, they do that.
[01:50:56.601 --> 01:50:57.541]  They find molesters.
[01:50:57.541 --> 01:50:58.461]  God bless you, sir.
[01:50:58.461 --> 01:51:00.802]  Got key calls coming up.
[01:51:00.802 --> 01:51:07.323]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[01:51:07.323 --> 01:51:09.904]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[01:51:09.904 --> 01:51:14.965]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[01:51:15.305 --> 01:51:20.270]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[01:51:20.270 --> 01:51:27.917]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from eFoods Direct now.
[01:51:27.917 --> 01:51:31.780]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[01:51:31.780 --> 01:51:33.302]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[01:51:33.562 --> 01:51:37.585]  I recently increased my supply from eFoodsDirect because we've all known this was coming.
[01:51:37.585 --> 01:51:40.486]  You know about their delicious, long-term, storable foods.
[01:51:40.486 --> 01:51:43.268]  The fact is, you can eat it anytime to save money today.
[01:51:43.268 --> 01:51:47.831]  And because it's stored for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[01:51:47.831 --> 01:51:48.492]  Don't wait!
[01:51:48.492 --> 01:51:51.053]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.

[01:53:57.359 --> 01:54:03.460]  Alright, John is in Wisconsin listening on 1520 AM.
[01:54:03.460 --> 01:54:11.642]  Wouldn't even know that was an affiliate, we're getting so many.
[01:54:27.051 --> 01:54:30.252]  And he's former special forces going to give us his take on all this.
[01:54:30.252 --> 01:54:36.934]  You know, I have clips I can play right now of army troops saying they will kill Americans in Katrina and did go to houses and take the guns.
[01:54:36.934 --> 01:54:38.315]  I have video of it.
[01:54:38.315 --> 01:54:42.556]  So don't forget that's the default position and we have the training manuals.
[01:54:42.556 --> 01:54:45.517]  And this is the problem with big government.
[01:54:45.517 --> 01:54:47.818]  People that love big government say it's going to help people.
[01:54:47.818 --> 01:54:55.361]  It allows tyrants to get in and have questionnaires and things and hire people that will do anything they're told.
[01:54:55.361 --> 01:54:55.501]  And
[01:54:57.611 --> 01:54:59.052]  We're in a lot of trouble.
[01:54:59.052 --> 01:55:03.756]  I mean, the globalists can sit back while there's a civil war in this country, and that is their plan.
[01:55:03.756 --> 01:55:08.640]  Go ahead, John, in Wisconsin, and make your point on this, sir.
[01:55:08.640 --> 01:55:15.787]  Well, the closest thing I can compare this to is, I don't know if you've ever actually seen the show Jericho.
[01:55:15.787 --> 01:55:24.154]  Yes, I saw one episode of it where contractors within the government nuke cities to bring in martial law to pose as saviors and then try to round up the patriots.
[01:55:25.111 --> 01:55:27.513]  That's about where you're at.
[01:55:27.513 --> 01:55:30.916]  I mean, it's just a matter of time.
[01:55:30.916 --> 01:55:34.959]  What do you make of how bold and crazy this is, though?
[01:55:34.959 --> 01:55:47.650]  Well, there's so many things that I've seen that would blow your mind, you know, just how we treat other people and their own country.
[01:55:47.650 --> 01:55:51.053]  I can only imagine if this turns on us.
[01:55:52.971 --> 01:55:53.491]  I don't know.
[01:55:53.491 --> 01:55:56.592]  I hope that the American spirit will, you know, do what it always does.
[01:55:56.592 --> 01:55:58.193]  Well, look at what they've gotten away with.
[01:55:58.193 --> 01:55:59.733]  Sodium fluoride in the water.
[01:55:59.733 --> 01:56:01.614]  Kim trailing us.
[01:56:01.614 --> 01:56:04.495]  NSA admits they're illegally spying on us.
[01:56:04.495 --> 01:56:07.115]  The government funds Al-Qaeda in Libya and Syria.
[01:56:07.115 --> 01:56:10.136]  Ted Turner goes on TV and says, I like troops committing suicide.
[01:56:10.136 --> 01:56:10.717]  They need to.
[01:56:10.717 --> 01:56:12.277]  They're bad people.
[01:56:12.277 --> 01:56:14.178]  I mean, did you hear that clip when I played it?
[01:56:14.178 --> 01:56:18.659]  And that's two days ago and no one even talked about it.
[01:56:18.659 --> 01:56:21.680]  Well, there's a lot of people that probably, you know,
[01:56:23.325 --> 01:56:24.825]  They don't want to believe it.
[01:56:24.825 --> 01:56:26.726]  That's what I mean though.
[01:56:26.726 --> 01:56:29.606]  The EU just came out with their new symbol.
[01:56:29.606 --> 01:56:32.827]  And I saw this and didn't believe it when I looked on the official EU site.
[01:56:32.827 --> 01:56:36.687]  It's a giant star with hammers and sickles.
[01:56:36.687 --> 01:56:44.029]  I mean, it's like the troops need to kill themselves, hammer and sickles, the family's bad, forced inoculations, world government's good.
[01:56:44.029 --> 01:56:48.289]  Have you heard the newscast where they announced we're under world government now?
[01:56:48.289 --> 01:56:48.990]  I have not.
[01:56:48.990 --> 01:56:50.770]  I have to be honest with you.
[01:56:52.648 --> 01:56:55.369]  Turn on any, you know, go to look at anything online.
[01:56:55.369 --> 01:56:58.991]  It's, it just, I wonder what the hell I even did over there.
[01:56:58.991 --> 01:57:02.052]  No, I hear you.
[01:57:02.052 --> 01:57:03.773]  I mean, what about your buddies or people?
[01:57:03.773 --> 01:57:04.734]  I mean, are they waking up?
[01:57:04.734 --> 01:57:07.655]  Is any, are they concerned?
[01:57:07.655 --> 01:57:13.658]  Well, it seems like, uh, everybody is.
[01:57:13.658 --> 01:57:18.420]  I mean, it's just, I honestly believe I hadn't actually seen that show Jericho.
[01:57:19.287 --> 01:57:27.769]  Uh, but I have Netflix and I seen it on there and I kind of read what it was about and I turned it on and I, I mean, this is basically about, I mean, it's just a matter of time.
[01:57:27.769 --> 01:57:28.450]  We all know it.
[01:57:28.450 --> 01:57:37.932]  We've seen, you know, if you could see the way that we treat people in their own country, if we were to get treated like that, I mean, I don't know.
[01:57:37.932 --> 01:57:40.113]  It's only a matter of time before they start eliminating.
[01:57:40.113 --> 01:57:41.253]  I'll be on the first of the list.
[01:57:42.691 --> 01:57:43.432]  Well, that's the deal.
[01:57:43.432 --> 01:57:49.076]  It'll be easy when they go out with the first high-value target list, but after that, people aren't going to wait anymore.
[01:57:49.076 --> 01:57:52.318]  They're going to come for the idiots that follow these illegal orders.
[01:57:52.318 --> 01:57:57.963]  This is a death sentence for the police and military that try to execute this.
[01:57:57.963 --> 01:58:02.126]  Within one week of launching these operations, they will notice a complete shift
[01:58:02.546 --> 01:58:04.106]  Well, I would hope that there is.
[01:58:04.106 --> 01:58:04.786]  I mean, we're cowboys.
[01:58:04.786 --> 01:58:05.727]  That's what we are.
[01:58:05.727 --> 01:58:06.587]  We're American.
[01:58:06.587 --> 01:58:07.107]  We say sir to nobody.
[01:58:27.833 --> 01:58:33.839]  Well, it's all, we got a bunch of commie New World Order globalists running us and they're offshore and they want to bring this country down.
[01:58:33.839 --> 01:58:36.702]  The answer to this is not have this civil war.
[01:58:36.702 --> 01:58:41.266]  The answer is get the word out now.
[01:58:41.266 --> 01:58:44.950]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:44.950 --> 01:58:46.891]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.689 --> 01:58:53.711]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[01:58:53.711 --> 01:58:58.735]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:58:58.735 --> 01:59:05.901]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[01:59:06.041 --> 01:59:11.668]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[01:59:11.668 --> 01:59:15.693]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[01:59:15.693 --> 01:59:20.419]  You've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[01:59:20.419 --> 01:59:25.645]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[01:59:25.885 --> 01:59:29.127]  Strategic Relocation 3rd Edition by Joel Skousen.
[01:59:29.127 --> 01:59:31.689]  When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.
[01:59:31.689 --> 01:59:36.392]  AeroSafe used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[01:59:36.392 --> 01:59:39.274]  Hand-cranked shortwave AM FM radios.
[01:59:39.274 --> 01:59:46.478]  Everything that we've researched and found to be the best is available at InfoWarshop.com and your purchase makes our InfoWar possible.
[01:59:46.478 --> 01:59:47.759]  We're getting prepared.
[01:59:47.759 --> 01:59:48.420]  Are you?
[01:59:48.420 --> 01:59:49.200]  InfoWarshop.com
[01:59:53.689 --> 01:59:56.090]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.090 --> 02:00:05.492]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.492 --> 02:00:06.792]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.792 --> 02:00:08.573]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.573 --> 02:00:10.333]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.333 --> 02:00:11.913]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.913 --> 02:00:13.834]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.834 --> 02:00:17.655]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.655 --> 02:00:21.716]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.266 --> 02:00:25.028]  All right, Scott is anonymous.
[02:00:25.028 --> 02:00:27.271]  Not saying where he's calling from.
[02:00:27.271 --> 02:00:29.294]  Active police.
[02:00:29.294 --> 02:00:30.976]  And we want to get his take on all this.
[02:00:30.976 --> 02:00:38.947]  I mean, you have to understand, I don't just have some National Guard guy on saying they're being told to get ready for gun confiscation and martial law and shutting down infrastructure.
[02:00:39.347 --> 02:00:40.528]  I have the executive orders.
[02:00:40.528 --> 02:00:42.329]  I have the new army training manuals.
[02:00:42.329 --> 02:00:43.330]  I've shot the video.
[02:00:43.330 --> 02:00:44.711]  I've talked to the other sources.
[02:00:44.711 --> 02:00:46.152]  I have the Army Times.
[02:00:46.152 --> 02:00:53.978]  This is all hiding in plain view because when they get ready to actually go operational, pull the trigger, they have to go ahead and roll it all out.
[02:00:53.978 --> 02:00:54.578]  And see, that's the thing.
[02:00:54.578 --> 02:00:55.819]  This has always been hidden.
[02:00:55.819 --> 02:00:57.520]  This is now rolling out.
[02:00:57.520 --> 02:01:02.484]  Now, that may just be some new shy-off because let me tell you, this is not going to go well for the government.
[02:01:03.228 --> 02:01:07.990]  Most people will roll over, five to ten percent or not, and it is going to be devastating.
[02:01:07.990 --> 02:01:09.930]  The globalists couldn't even hold Baghdad.
[02:01:09.930 --> 02:01:10.791]  But see, that's the plan.
[02:01:10.791 --> 02:01:12.591]  The globalists sat offshore.
[02:01:12.591 --> 02:01:16.013]  The plan was to tear up Iraq and tear up our trips.
[02:01:16.013 --> 02:01:20.694]  See, when you understand it's chaos they want, then you're like, oh, I get it.
[02:01:20.694 --> 02:01:25.156]  Let's go to Scott, an anonymous active police officer.
[02:01:25.156 --> 02:01:26.796]  What do you think of all the stuff being covered here?
[02:01:26.796 --> 02:01:27.437]  Do you agree?
[02:01:27.437 --> 02:01:27.917]  Disagree?
[02:01:27.917 --> 02:01:28.617]  What's your take on it?
[02:01:29.364 --> 02:01:37.310]  I absolutely agree with you, Alex, and first of all, I want to say God bless you for what you're doing, and we need many more people like you.
[02:01:37.310 --> 02:01:56.864]  As far as I can see, I've been a police officer in Class 1A city on the East Coast for approximately 10 years, and I can tell you from the people that I've encountered on a vast majority basis, my co-workers, that if, and believe it or not, this city is incredibly liberal, but
[02:01:57.724 --> 02:02:04.547]  The majority of the police officers are not going to, at least in this city, rank and file, follow orders.
[02:02:04.547 --> 02:02:07.188]  They are waking up exponentially.
[02:02:07.188 --> 02:02:13.431]  We have an incredibly large veteran population within our ranks.
[02:02:14.791 --> 02:02:26.757]  And what we have noticed is in the past several months, maybe a year at the most, there's a lot more federal police officers doing their supposed job in our city.
[02:02:26.757 --> 02:02:27.817]  But there's just a lot more.
[02:02:27.817 --> 02:02:30.918]  We encounter a lot more activity.
[02:02:30.918 --> 02:02:31.439]  Sure, sure.
[02:02:31.439 --> 02:02:32.159]  Let me just stop you.
[02:02:32.159 --> 02:02:37.321]  I want to hold you to the next segment because some stations don't carry this segment and what you're saying, officer, is so important.
[02:02:37.321 --> 02:02:37.841]  That's it.
[02:02:37.841 --> 02:02:39.122]  I see giant black
[02:02:39.802 --> 02:02:41.924]  Armored trucks that say Homeland Security.
[02:02:41.924 --> 02:02:52.351]  I see police cars, little trucks, medium-sized trucks, Suburbans, and cops all over are getting these little federal ID cards to be like little deputies of the feds.
[02:02:52.351 --> 02:02:54.613]  It's InfraGard with the citizens, all that.
[02:02:54.613 --> 02:02:58.816]  The churches suddenly have these weird federal consultants in them telling them what to say.
[02:02:58.816 --> 02:03:04.880]  It's a total takeover because they know most police are good people because they live in the real world.
[02:03:04.880 --> 02:03:08.143]  They're just bringing in their own goons.
[02:03:08.143 --> 02:03:08.563]  Absolutely.
[02:03:09.707 --> 02:03:13.816]  Wow, so continue to elaborate on this.
[02:03:13.816 --> 02:03:19.448]  It's just my very humble viewpoint, just things that we observe.
[02:03:20.185 --> 02:03:23.127]  You know, you're kind of caught between a rock and a hard place.
[02:03:23.127 --> 02:03:30.010]  You don't want to be too vocal, because then you're going to be labeled as one of those nuts, and we're under so much scrutiny as it is.
[02:03:30.010 --> 02:03:40.936]  Even they go so far as, you know, you go to work and start talking about, you know, watching the Prepper Show on National Geographic, and, you know, you don't know who's listening, and it's just ridiculous, the paranoia.
[02:03:40.936 --> 02:03:47.120]  And as a matter of fact, two months ago, we had a briefing, a roll call briefing with
[02:03:47.640 --> 02:03:47.900]  We're good.
[02:04:06.290 --> 02:04:07.231]  It's unbelievable.
[02:04:27.205 --> 02:04:27.786]  We're good to go.
[02:04:46.863 --> 02:04:48.564]  And any ideas about these feds?
[02:04:48.564 --> 02:04:51.487]  Because they've really vetted these feds, whoever they're told.
[02:04:51.487 --> 02:04:55.030]  But still, most of the feds I talk to are one of our best sources.
[02:04:55.030 --> 02:04:56.811]  They don't like what's going on either.
[02:04:56.811 --> 02:04:58.413]  So we're going to get your take on that, officer.
[02:04:58.413 --> 02:04:59.093]  Please stay there.
[02:04:59.093 --> 02:04:59.894]  Right back in three minutes.
[02:05:02.910 --> 02:05:11.016]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal Ben Soap Company.
[02:05:11.016 --> 02:05:15.099]  Alex and his staff have used these pure soap products for years.

[02:06:00.539 --> 02:06:01.540]  Aaron Fullin here.
[02:06:01.540 --> 02:06:13.147]  As the food police shut down food co-ops, the Amish, and small farmers, Americans are losing access, not just to raw milk and homemade cheeses, but to healthy, home-crafted sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut, yogurt, and kefir.
[02:06:13.147 --> 02:06:16.970]  It seems there's a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria.
[02:06:17.170 --> 02:06:19.931]  But frankly, I'm not sure what the food police are so afraid of.
[02:06:19.931 --> 02:06:27.833]  These remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history, with archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found across the globe in almost every culture.
[02:06:27.833 --> 02:06:35.335]  Even today, Japanese eat miso, Africans eat fermented porridges, Koreans eat kimchi, and in India, fermented milk is a staple for healthy living.
[02:06:35.635 --> 02:06:36.756]  But here's some good news.
[02:06:36.756 --> 02:06:42.982]  Self-reliant Americans can now discover the secrets to making these amazing fermented foods legally and privately in their own homes.
[02:06:42.982 --> 02:06:46.305]  Since it's still legal to make these foods as long as you can make them yourself.
[02:06:46.305 --> 02:06:49.148]  For more information, check out fermentationfactor.com.
[02:06:49.148 --> 02:06:51.170]  That's fermentationfactor.com.

[02:08:11.906 --> 02:08:15.789]  Okay, I got a bunch of geopolitical, economic,
[02:08:32.381 --> 02:08:33.942]  Election news I want to get to.
[02:08:33.942 --> 02:08:35.323]  Also some hurricane news.
[02:08:35.323 --> 02:08:37.124]  But we're continuing with your phone calls right now.
[02:08:37.124 --> 02:08:41.226]  We're going to go to a police officer who's waiting patiently on hold right now.
[02:08:41.226 --> 02:08:44.028]  Active in a major East Coast large city.
[02:08:44.028 --> 02:08:47.930]  National Guard whistleblower Doomsday Preppers will be targeted as a terrorist.
[02:08:47.930 --> 02:08:50.352]  And then everything this current serving...
[02:08:51.405 --> 02:09:05.456]  Low-level officer in the army told us it is all broken down in our story where here's an army manual, here's preppers not allowed to fly, here's preppers being arrested for no reason, here's government training manuals saying preppers are bad.
[02:09:05.456 --> 02:09:15.924]  Since when is seeing the world rot around you trying to get self-sufficient, trying to get some food, trying to have a garden, trying to have a water filter, trying to get some extra ammo,
[02:09:16.664 --> 02:09:17.945]  I mean, that's all culture.
[02:09:17.945 --> 02:09:19.887]  The Swiss do that, the Dutch do that.
[02:09:19.887 --> 02:09:21.488]  Since when is that bad?
[02:09:21.488 --> 02:09:24.891]  In Israel they do that, the Mormons have done that.
[02:09:24.891 --> 02:09:27.352]  Since when is this so demonized?
[02:09:27.352 --> 02:09:28.874]  And now, we broke this when...
[02:09:31.138 --> 02:09:36.620]  Well, a state police officer sent me one document, a federal marshal sent me the other, one week apart.
[02:09:36.620 --> 02:09:39.881]  The media for a week said it wasn't real, and then later had to admit it was.
[02:09:39.881 --> 02:09:41.462]  Here was the Washington Times on it.
[02:09:41.462 --> 02:09:46.484]  Napolitano stands by controversial report, April 16, 2009.
[02:09:46.484 --> 02:09:51.006]  She stands by the report which lists returning veterans among terrorist risk in the U.S.
[02:09:51.006 --> 02:09:52.826]  Now they say, number one.
[02:09:52.826 --> 02:09:56.668]  Now you see it openly, yes, they're the terrorists.
[02:09:57.861 --> 02:09:59.322]  Now I've actuaried this out.
[02:09:59.322 --> 02:10:00.223]  I've broken it down.
[02:10:00.223 --> 02:10:08.889]  The only thing it could be is an attempt to wipe out the military and police and the American people in some type of civil war.
[02:10:08.889 --> 02:10:11.011]  And the preparations all show that.
[02:10:11.011 --> 02:10:18.297]  And the NLE national level exercises the last four years in a row publicly say they want to use foreign assets.
[02:10:18.297 --> 02:10:21.179]  So we've seen this in areas of Europe under Gladio.
[02:10:21.179 --> 02:10:24.942]  We've seen this in the Middle East getting Shiite and Sunni to kill each other.
[02:10:24.942 --> 02:10:27.023]  The New World Order model is civil war.
[02:10:28.104 --> 02:10:34.489]  And they're getting the police ready for it, and they've been secretly for about five years saying, veterans will IED you.
[02:10:34.489 --> 02:10:36.311]  You will be bombed by veterans.
[02:10:36.311 --> 02:10:38.513]  Now that's been publicly admitted.
[02:10:38.513 --> 02:10:44.117]  The Army Times writes, yes, police, you will face veterans that will try to blow you up on the highway.
[02:10:44.117 --> 02:10:47.900]  Well, only if you went and arrested their daddy and put him in a FEMA camp.
[02:10:47.900 --> 02:10:50.722]  I mean, you'll have to start the Civil War for that to begin.
[02:10:50.722 --> 02:10:54.065]  And the last thing we want is this to happen.
[02:10:54.065 --> 02:10:56.327]  This is what the globalists offshore want.
[02:10:57.423 --> 02:10:59.504]  What did you see Ted Turner two days ago on CNN?
[02:10:59.504 --> 02:11:01.426]  I'm going to play the clip if you don't believe me.
[02:11:01.426 --> 02:11:02.566]  He said, I'm glad.
[02:11:02.566 --> 02:11:03.987]  Let me give you the exact quote.
[02:11:03.987 --> 02:11:04.888]  He said, I think it's good.
[02:11:04.888 --> 02:11:06.729]  He goes, I think it's fantastic.
[02:11:06.729 --> 02:11:07.769]  Didn't say it stopped.
[02:11:07.769 --> 02:11:09.350]  He said, I think it's good.
[02:11:09.350 --> 02:11:10.011]  Fantastic.
[02:11:10.011 --> 02:11:10.611]  Got really happy.
[02:11:10.611 --> 02:11:12.432]  He goes, I think it's fan.
[02:11:12.432 --> 02:11:13.313]  I think it's good.
[02:11:13.313 --> 02:11:14.414]  US troops are killing themselves.
[02:11:14.414 --> 02:11:14.854]  That's a quote.
[02:11:16.380 --> 02:11:17.620]  They hate you.
[02:11:17.620 --> 02:11:20.221]  They want to use you and then get rid of you.
[02:11:20.221 --> 02:11:24.203]  Now, if they can give you a psychological test, find control freaks, that's what they want.
[02:11:24.203 --> 02:11:30.565]  Going back to the police officers, Scott, who's anonymous, East Coast and a major, you know, Big Ten city in his words.
[02:11:30.565 --> 02:11:31.966]  Recap what you were telling me.
[02:11:31.966 --> 02:11:33.667]  Get into the threat fusion centers.
[02:11:33.667 --> 02:11:41.630]  You were talking about the federalization because you were saying, I mean, to repeat, most of the officers are awake now, so they're just bringing in feds.
[02:11:41.630 --> 02:11:42.590]  Break that down for us.
[02:11:44.262 --> 02:11:45.784]  It's just my personal observation.
[02:11:45.784 --> 02:11:57.053]  We're seeing a lot more federal police officers in the city, you know, under the guise, in my opinion, of doing their undercover job.
[02:11:57.053 --> 02:12:03.519]  We'll get a lot of calls of, you know, have all, you know, marked units stay out of such and such area a lot more often.
[02:12:03.519 --> 02:12:07.523]  Now, it very well could be, you know, that they're setting up operations that are
[02:12:09.893 --> 02:12:10.453]  We're good.
[02:12:26.286 --> 02:12:37.112]  There's a lot more distrust, not only with the local and state governments, but just with the federal government, and their inept ability to take care of the population.
[02:12:37.112 --> 02:12:44.076]  If something, we'll just say it like Katrina would happen, and the burden on our shoulders to, I mean...
[02:12:45.041 --> 02:12:50.624]  Honestly, in our city, we're on the verge of chaos on a normal day.
[02:12:50.624 --> 02:12:58.448]  And the cliche of the thin blue line between anarchy and chaos in this city is absolutely true.
[02:12:58.448 --> 02:13:04.771]  And one small tipping point of a natural disaster or a federally created disaster would
[02:13:06.044 --> 02:13:18.459]  The absolutely overwhelming and the police in the city would not do anything as far as the majority fall into the rank and file of anything that they wouldn't believe.
[02:13:18.459 --> 02:13:22.543]  I mean, there would be a mass exodus to your homes to protect your family and
[02:13:26.448 --> 02:13:34.576]  So, you know, we're not too sure with the marked increase of the federal police, if they would hinder our exit from the city, if they would... Well, exactly.
[02:13:34.576 --> 02:13:35.878]  That's what they did in Katrina.
[02:13:35.878 --> 02:13:37.059]  They wouldn't let anybody leave.
[02:13:37.059 --> 02:13:44.987]  I mean, the sheriff sat there for five days under orders while his mother had a cell phone that she kept charged, you know, had enough battery.
[02:13:45.527 --> 02:13:47.309]  And he talked to her for three days and he couldn't come.
[02:13:47.309 --> 02:13:48.590]  He got there in five, she was dead.
[02:13:48.590 --> 02:13:50.172]  Her phone went dead in three.
[02:13:50.172 --> 02:13:57.820]  And his mother in a nursing home with two feet of water begging the sheriff and he took the federal orders and let his mother die.
[02:13:57.820 --> 02:13:59.201]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[02:13:59.201 --> 02:14:01.243]  My mother's dying, begging for help.
[02:14:01.243 --> 02:14:02.545]  You better not get in my way.
[02:14:02.545 --> 02:14:04.547]  And that was what's so evil.
[02:14:04.547 --> 02:14:05.228]  Let me ask you this.
[02:14:05.868 --> 02:14:07.529]  Again, I mean, I know you're a police officer.
[02:14:07.529 --> 02:14:08.630]  I know you've been given this training.
[02:14:08.630 --> 02:14:11.832]  I read about it where they say the veterans are going to attack you with IEDs.
[02:14:11.832 --> 02:14:14.794]  That's been nationwide training for at least five years.
[02:14:14.794 --> 02:14:24.721]  Do you concur with my analysis that this, if they do try to pull something and do this, that it's designed to just wipe out the American people?
[02:14:24.721 --> 02:14:27.803]  Because it's not something that anybody's going to win.
[02:14:27.803 --> 02:14:29.504]  There is no winning in this.
[02:14:29.504 --> 02:14:32.046]  The only way you win is not having it happen.
[02:14:32.046 --> 02:14:35.308]  But if they try to send the police
[02:14:36.249 --> 02:14:37.930]  Or anybody to try to take guns.
[02:14:37.930 --> 02:14:40.713]  I mean, it is a death sentence.
[02:14:40.713 --> 02:14:41.514]  Or do you disagree with that?
[02:14:42.355 --> 02:14:50.257]  No, I absolutely agree with that, and it's going to be one of their tools that they're going to use to have the people chew each other up while they just sit back.
[02:14:50.257 --> 02:14:51.698]  Absolutely.
[02:14:51.698 --> 02:15:09.103]  And on your comment that you made about the veterans being vilified, it wasn't too long after you had talked about it, several months ago I believe, that we actually, I couldn't believe the timing, we had an active shooter exercise at one of our local school campuses.
[02:15:09.805 --> 02:15:28.386]  And it was just kind of hilarious, not really hilarious, but coincidental we'll say that the active shooter who was being portrayed, you know, the police officer who was the active shooter, the bad guy, was dressed in Desert Storm fatigue, the whole nine yards, he was dressed as a returning
[02:15:29.046 --> 02:15:30.187]  I think so.
[02:15:45.038 --> 02:15:48.881]  They've backed off on these some because it's so outrageous, but I'm not joking.
[02:15:48.881 --> 02:15:51.704]  You can pull up the AP article from like six years ago.
[02:15:51.704 --> 02:16:01.611]  People got so upset in Michigan and they said, well, it's a federal mandated drill where they had guys in camos say they were militia killing the little kids, elementary kids, part of the drill.
[02:16:02.412 --> 02:16:04.253]  No, drilling, killing, I'm not really killing him.
[02:16:04.253 --> 02:16:08.897]  Saying we are, we are citizens against public education.
[02:16:08.897 --> 02:16:12.280]  And again, it's just pure role-playing demonization.
[02:16:12.280 --> 02:16:14.761]  But yeah, no, that's the drill.
[02:16:14.761 --> 02:16:18.124]  What you saw was mild.
[02:16:18.124 --> 02:16:21.406]  Have you ever had FEMA come in and teach you that George Washington's bad?
[02:16:21.406 --> 02:16:25.309]  No, no, we haven't had that yet.
[02:16:25.309 --> 02:16:31.114]  But this, you know, this city's so liberal, I mean, and if I
[02:16:32.920 --> 02:16:36.030]  We'll just say that this city has incredibly close ties to the Founding Fathers.
[02:16:36.969 --> 02:16:41.691]  Okay, so you're in, what, Philadelphia then?
[02:16:41.691 --> 02:16:45.573]  All right, well, yeah, I guess it is kind of hard to demonize the Founding Fathers in Philadelphia.
[02:16:45.573 --> 02:16:47.915]  They sure do it in Kansas City.
[02:16:47.915 --> 02:16:49.536]  I've got footage of it.
[02:16:49.536 --> 02:16:54.538]  And the cops are sitting there shaking their heads a little bit, but it's just insane.
[02:16:54.538 --> 02:16:56.679]  The firefighters actually started speaking up a little bit.
[02:16:56.679 --> 02:16:58.480]  Well, anything else you'd like to add to people?
[02:16:58.480 --> 02:17:01.342]  Because, again, I don't see this working.
[02:17:01.342 --> 02:17:05.664]  I don't see them getting the guns unless the plan is, like you said, everybody chewing each other up.
[02:17:07.648 --> 02:17:22.218]  Yeah, I really don't see how they're going unless it's some, you know, absolutely amazing type of, you know, door-to-door martial law situation, getting the guns, rounding up the guns.
[02:17:22.218 --> 02:17:28.682]  It's not, I guess, a stretch of the imagination to say it's possible, but it would be incredibly hard and it would be incredibly messy.
[02:17:29.162 --> 02:17:38.171]  Well yeah, if 1% of 170 million gun owners, that's what it's up to now, if 1% fought, that's 1.7 million.
[02:17:38.171 --> 02:17:40.933]  How many veterans, are there 30 million in this country?
[02:17:40.933 --> 02:17:47.099]  A lot of them are just absolutely being restrained from violence at this point.
[02:17:47.099 --> 02:17:48.340]  If 1% of 30 million fight, that's 300,000.
[02:17:52.203 --> 02:17:54.244]  I mean, can anybody imagine what this is?
[02:17:54.244 --> 02:17:57.326]  I mean, that is the New World Order time bomb.
[02:17:57.326 --> 02:17:58.726]  We've got to be smarter.
[02:17:58.726 --> 02:18:04.809]  I forget which James Bond movie it is where, you know, he shows two fighting fish kill each other and then the other one opens the door and it lives.
[02:18:04.809 --> 02:18:06.990]  You know, it's like, see, we have them kill each other.
[02:18:06.990 --> 02:18:09.631]  That's the basis of the New World Order system.
[02:18:09.631 --> 02:18:10.252]  What's your take?
[02:18:10.252 --> 02:18:14.513]  Did you hear the Ted Turner clip we played where he said, quote, I think it's good U.S.
[02:18:14.513 --> 02:18:15.474]  troops are killing themselves?
[02:18:18.033 --> 02:18:19.053]  It's just sickening.
[02:18:19.053 --> 02:18:20.294]  You know, it's just sickening.
[02:18:20.294 --> 02:18:26.475]  To somebody like that, I mean, the platform that he has, he has no credibility as far as I'm concerned, but you're right.
[02:18:26.475 --> 02:18:27.835]  You know, it's just sickening.
[02:18:27.835 --> 02:18:31.376]  But the bigger story is, how is it not a national news story?
[02:18:31.376 --> 02:18:36.317]  This happened two days ago, and we just learned of it, and no one's covered it.
[02:18:36.317 --> 02:18:37.458]  Oh, you're right.
[02:18:37.458 --> 02:18:43.099]  You know, it doesn't surprise me with the, you know, the, it just doesn't surprise me.
[02:18:44.571 --> 02:18:45.713]  Well, God bless you.
[02:18:45.713 --> 02:18:47.596]  Just to recap, because you were in the other segment.
[02:18:47.596 --> 02:18:50.080]  Some stations don't carry that short little first five minutes.
[02:18:50.080 --> 02:18:53.365]  You are saying that people are waking up in amazing numbers of other police.
[02:18:54.332 --> 02:19:01.735]  Absolutely, and it's nice to go to the local Redbox and the different places and to see these InfoWars stickers all over the place, and I'm seeing a lot more of them.
[02:19:01.735 --> 02:19:03.936]  So, Alex, continue your work.
[02:19:03.936 --> 02:19:07.098]  God bless you, and hope you keep yourself and your family safe.
[02:19:07.098 --> 02:19:07.618]  Thank you.
[02:19:07.618 --> 02:19:10.379]  Yeah, and again, I'm all in with my family.
[02:19:10.379 --> 02:19:12.880]  The only way we're making it is we defeat these people.
[02:19:12.880 --> 02:19:15.341]  A lot of people say, man, aren't you worried?
[02:19:15.341 --> 02:19:15.881]  You know what?
[02:19:15.881 --> 02:19:21.764]  I believe in God, and that's really the difference between who I am and who people are that serve this system.
[02:19:21.764 --> 02:19:23.785]  A lot of people serve evil because they're afraid of it.
[02:19:25.188 --> 02:19:28.970]  I am afraid of giving into it.
[02:19:28.970 --> 02:19:35.472]  I look at my children, how innocent and good they are, and I just say, God, it's in your hands, man.
[02:19:35.472 --> 02:19:38.093]  I certainly don't need some Job-like test, I'll tell you that.
[02:19:38.093 --> 02:19:45.676]  I'm a bad man compared to somebody like Job, and I know a lot of you are as well, but we love God, we love good, and we have to do the right thing.
[02:19:45.676 --> 02:19:47.037]  America's greatest test is here.
[02:19:47.837 --> 02:19:52.438]  And, I mean, I'm telling you, we've got a vicious group of criminals in charge of the government.
[02:19:52.438 --> 02:19:54.979]  They carried off Fast and Furious, for heaven's sakes.
[02:19:54.979 --> 02:19:59.280]  More calls straight ahead, and then you're... And then a news is coming up.
[02:19:59.280 --> 02:20:01.101]  Stay with us.
[02:20:01.101 --> 02:20:02.121]  Aaron Fullin here.
[02:20:02.121 --> 02:20:13.624]  As the Food Police shut down food co-ops, the Amish, and small farmers, Americans are losing access, not just to raw milk and homemade cheeses, but to healthy, home-crafted sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut, yogurt, and kefir.
[02:20:13.624 --> 02:20:17.425]  It seems there's a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria.
[02:20:17.645 --> 02:20:20.387]  But frankly, I'm not sure what the food police are so afraid of.
[02:20:20.387 --> 02:20:28.231]  These remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history, with archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found across the globe in almost every culture.
[02:20:28.231 --> 02:20:35.955]  Even today, Japanese eat miso, Africans eat fermented porridges, Koreans eat kimchi, and in India, fermented milk is a staple for healthy living.
[02:20:35.955 --> 02:20:37.076]  But here's some good news.
[02:20:37.076 --> 02:20:40.538]  Self-reliant Americans can now discover the secrets to making these amazing fermented
[02:20:40.538 --> 02:20:40.818]  I think so.
[02:21:02.887 --> 02:21:05.650]  25 years is reason to celebrate!

[02:22:02.284 --> 02:22:07.346]  That's what it sounds like when a burglar kicks in the door of a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[02:22:07.346 --> 02:22:09.487]  Don't let your home be the next target.
[02:22:09.487 --> 02:22:13.128]  Make it look like someone is home watching television with Fake TV.
[02:22:13.128 --> 02:22:17.610]  Fake TV is a small electronic device that makes the same light as a real television.
[02:22:17.610 --> 02:22:20.732]  So from outside, it looks like someone is home watching TV.
[02:22:20.732 --> 02:22:25.353]  Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer, but is far more convincing to burglars.
[02:22:25.353 --> 02:22:31.356]  Fake TV deters burglars, costs far less than an alarm, and is highly recommended by numerous police departments.
[02:22:31.696 --> 02:22:33.598]  Use it anytime you're away from home.
[02:22:33.598 --> 02:22:40.643]  To order your fake TV for only $34.95, go to Faketv.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.

[02:22:56.055 --> 02:22:57.637]  Faketv.com.
[02:22:57.637 --> 02:22:58.938]  The Burglar Deterrent.
[02:23:00.603 --> 02:23:08.345]  I don't mean to be nosy, but do you have the 37 food items you can't get in the coming disaster and may not survive without?
[02:23:08.345 --> 02:23:11.666]  As you already know, something big is about to hit the U.S.
[02:23:11.666 --> 02:23:13.467]  and you have got to be prepared.
[02:23:13.467 --> 02:23:17.428]  Did you know that your local grocery store only keeps a three-day supply of food on hand?
[02:23:17.888 --> 02:23:30.101]  So if there's any interruption in our fragile food supply chain, or even a hint of a crisis, then the three-day supply at your local grocery store will be gobbled up by the mob and menace, and you and your family could be in serious trouble.
[02:23:30.101 --> 02:23:39.951]  That's why my friend just created a free video at 37items.com that reveals the 37 critical items you should hoard now before it's too late.
[02:23:40.492 --> 02:23:50.021]  Go watch the important video at 37items.com to discover the 37 things you can't buy after a disaster and may not survive without.
[02:23:50.021 --> 02:23:56.207]  I'm not sure how long the video will be online, so go to 37items.com before it's gone forever.
[02:23:56.207 --> 02:23:57.368]  Again, that's 37items.com.
[02:24:02.321 --> 02:24:08.151]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:08.151 --> 02:24:11.616]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:24:11.616 --> 02:24:12.838]  Okay, I'm gonna go to Josh.
[02:24:14.426 --> 02:24:18.469]  Mike, Tom, and X from California.
[02:24:18.469 --> 02:24:21.632]  And then that's going to be it for calls because I need to get to the rest of the news.
[02:24:21.632 --> 02:24:27.557]  And replay that clip on CNN of Ted Turner saying he's glad US troops are killing themselves.
[02:24:27.557 --> 02:24:30.559]  He starts to say, I think it's good.
[02:24:30.559 --> 02:24:31.620]  I think it's good.
[02:24:31.620 --> 02:24:36.044]  I mean, it just shows how sick these people are.
[02:24:36.044 --> 02:24:37.505]  It's so sick.
[02:24:37.505 --> 02:24:40.347]  We're going to be breaking that down and a lot more.
[02:24:40.347 --> 02:24:42.910]  But right now, let's go to Josh in Florida.
[02:24:43.850 --> 02:24:46.411]  I'm listening to you at the moment.
[02:24:46.411 --> 02:24:49.293]  I'm wrapped up in what you're talking about.
[02:24:49.293 --> 02:24:52.274]  I came into the middle of the conversation.
[02:24:52.274 --> 02:24:55.795]  Can you catch me up a little bit?
[02:25:04.909 --> 02:25:05.510]  Well, no.
[02:25:05.510 --> 02:25:08.673]  I mean, we've got the military openly trying to confiscate guns.
[02:25:08.673 --> 02:25:10.175]  That's in their new manual.
[02:25:10.175 --> 02:25:15.060]  And we had a guest on who's in the Army National Guard here in Texas.
[02:25:15.060 --> 02:25:16.041]  He gave us all his info.
[02:25:16.041 --> 02:25:17.263]  We documented it.
[02:25:17.263 --> 02:25:20.727]  They're telling them preppers that are going to be the terrorists that they've got to round up, basically.
[02:25:22.341 --> 02:25:22.841]  I gotcha.
[02:25:22.841 --> 02:25:28.425]  You know, I went through Marine Corps training for a little bit.
[02:25:28.425 --> 02:25:34.789]  You know, everything was based on combat at first, and you kind of get the impression you're serving that greater good.
[02:25:34.789 --> 02:25:38.972]  I'm a younger guy myself, so I'm kind of just now coming out of all of that fog.
[02:25:38.972 --> 02:25:51.600]  But what was amazing, as I keep hearing you give the information you give on a daily basis, I connect these dots to these experiences I never thought I'd need to remember for any kind of relevant path to combat situation.
[02:25:52.060 --> 02:25:58.962]  Well, no, that's why the military and police, even if they hear I'm crazy, then they go, no, wait, that did happen, just like he said.
[02:25:58.962 --> 02:26:10.106]  Of course, I've been on this for, look, when I'm sort of getting sent footage by listeners of troops training to confiscate guns, and the role players were saying, I'm an American, I have rights, you can't do this in America.
[02:26:10.106 --> 02:26:12.366]  I said, man, there's a takeover plan afoot.
[02:26:12.366 --> 02:26:17.008]  Now, we're 14, 15 years later since I discovered all this, and it's out in the open now.
[02:26:17.768 --> 02:26:23.056]  But it's 50 times bigger in a force continuum than it ever was before.
[02:26:23.056 --> 02:26:25.699]  The point is, it used to be way down the road.
[02:26:25.699 --> 02:26:28.443]  Now it's right in my face, it's right in your face.
[02:26:28.443 --> 02:26:31.748]  And so thank God we got the jump on it, but I'm telling you, it's here.
[02:26:33.353 --> 02:26:35.174]  Well, you're right about that.
[02:26:35.174 --> 02:26:42.297]  That, for me, gives a very good example of environmentalization that it's taken me this long.
[02:26:42.297 --> 02:26:44.698]  I did that training almost ten years ago.
[02:26:44.698 --> 02:26:48.200]  Now, I've been listening to you for maybe about five.
[02:26:48.200 --> 02:27:01.486]  And again, things that you talk about on a regular basis maybe would have been things that I experienced during training or something else that I never would have even thought of again had they not been discussed later on and then connected in some way with the things you talk about.
[02:27:01.977 --> 02:27:17.524]  Well, I mean, that's the thing, just being aware, and people aren't dumb in this country, and God bless you, thanks for the call, they're compartmentalized, they're focused on things that don't matter, or things that do, like trying to pay their power bill, or whatever, or their car bill, or their kid's doctor bill.
[02:27:17.524 --> 02:27:23.727]  You know, that's why they want to keep us all poor, so that we're so busy just trying to make it, you know, the rat race, that we can't focus on anything else.
[02:27:23.727 --> 02:27:30.830]  But once you've studied history, this stuff happens over and over again, once you look at what's currently happening, and once you just start reading
[02:27:31.858 --> 02:27:39.623]  Officer manuals and things that are restricted but not classified, you know, that end up... I mean, the Army is so ham-fisted, folks.
[02:27:39.623 --> 02:27:43.946]  They put a lot of these out on their official websites and then reclassify them later.
[02:27:43.946 --> 02:27:47.628]  That happens a lot where they reclassify something because they're like, what did you do?
[02:27:47.628 --> 02:27:48.609]  Why did you put that out?
[02:27:48.609 --> 02:27:52.271]  You know, because people have private servers and public servers.
[02:27:52.271 --> 02:27:53.592]  So this stuff's everywhere.
[02:27:53.592 --> 02:28:00.817]  When you've got hundreds of thousands of personnel being given training and things over the years, this stuff's going to get out there.
[02:28:01.633 --> 02:28:03.414]  And so, that's what's happened.
[02:28:03.414 --> 02:28:06.476]  People always say, well, this conspiracy this big, it would come out.
[02:28:06.476 --> 02:28:08.137]  It has come out!
[02:28:08.137 --> 02:28:12.420]  Just the question is, will we have the nerve to admit how bad this is?
[02:28:12.420 --> 02:28:15.862]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in Alabama, ex-Marines and Army.
[02:28:15.862 --> 02:28:16.622]  Go ahead, Mike.
[02:28:16.622 --> 02:28:18.904]  Hey, Alex.
[02:28:18.904 --> 02:28:19.244]  Hey, buddy.
[02:28:19.244 --> 02:28:20.164]  I'm a former Marine.
[02:28:20.164 --> 02:28:22.426]  I served a year in Vietnam.
[02:28:22.426 --> 02:28:26.208]  And I served another 10 years later on in the National Guard.
[02:28:26.208 --> 02:28:29.070]  And when I was taking some of my political science courses in the 70s,
[02:28:30.222 --> 02:28:37.085]  We had a video when they had a major senator on there, one, you know, back then you would have recognized him as being a key senator.
[02:28:37.085 --> 02:28:39.345]  And they were asking him, why do you pass so many laws?
[02:28:39.345 --> 02:28:43.067]  You pass thousands of pages of new laws every year.
[02:28:43.067 --> 02:28:46.848]  And he kind of laughed, and he said, well, it's like this.
[02:28:46.848 --> 02:28:57.192]  The average law-abiding citizen goes to work, goes to church, pays his taxes, commits two to three misdemeanors a week, and one to two felonies a month, and they don't know it.
[02:28:57.192 --> 02:28:59.573]  We figure we can follow anybody around for a week,
[02:29:00.242 --> 02:29:01.748]  And arrest him for something.
[02:29:01.748 --> 02:29:02.773]  And then not long ago...
[02:29:03.627 --> 02:29:12.372]  John Stossel had kind of a follow-up on that, and he said the average American male commits two to three felonies each week, and you're not even aware of it.
[02:29:12.372 --> 02:29:19.936]  Yeah, no, we spend all our time trying to make sure we're following every unconstitutional garbage law because they'll set us up.
[02:29:19.936 --> 02:29:22.838]  And if they ever do set us up, you can know, folks, it was a set-up.
[02:29:22.838 --> 02:29:28.241]  We are so clean here, it is ridiculous, and everything's a crime now.
[02:29:28.241 --> 02:29:29.261]  You're absolutely right.
[02:29:29.261 --> 02:29:30.342]  Anything else you'd like to add, sir?
[02:29:32.091 --> 02:29:33.192]  No, that's it.
[02:29:33.192 --> 02:29:35.354]  I mean, a lot of people are waking up here now.
[02:29:35.354 --> 02:29:41.340]  I mean, my family... Hold on, I want to hear about that briefly, then we'll go to four or five other callers, and then to the rest of the news.
[02:29:41.340 --> 02:29:43.962]  And Ted Turner saying he wants the troops to kill themselves.
[02:29:43.962 --> 02:29:46.885]  How good it is, how fantastic it is.
[02:29:46.885 --> 02:29:51.690]  And this, again, and the bigger story... We're on the march.
[02:29:51.690 --> 02:29:54.212]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.212 --> 02:29:56.895]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.836 --> 02:30:07.359]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[02:30:07.359 --> 02:30:09.960]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[02:30:09.960 --> 02:30:15.343]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[02:30:15.343 --> 02:30:20.305]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[02:30:20.305 --> 02:30:27.568]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods or meat foods direct now.
[02:30:27.948 --> 02:30:31.811]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[02:30:31.811 --> 02:30:33.612]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[02:30:33.612 --> 02:30:37.615]  I recently increased my supply from eFoods Direct because we have all known this was coming.
[02:30:37.615 --> 02:30:40.537]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.
[02:30:40.537 --> 02:30:43.319]  The fact is you can eat at any time to save money today.
[02:30:43.319 --> 02:30:47.882]  And because it stores for 25 years, they're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[02:30:47.882 --> 02:30:48.542]  Don't wait!
[02:30:48.542 --> 02:30:50.023]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:30:50.023 --> 02:30:50.283]  Call 800-409-5633.
[02:30:56.027 --> 02:30:58.288]  Or eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:30:58.288 --> 02:31:00.650]  You can bet your life on eFoodsDirect.
[02:31:00.650 --> 02:31:06.133]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[02:31:06.133 --> 02:31:08.554]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[02:31:08.554 --> 02:31:14.258]  My friends, I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure.
[02:31:14.258 --> 02:31:17.660]  And it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[02:31:17.660 --> 02:31:21.102]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[02:31:21.102 --> 02:31:22.783]  There's no priming required.
[02:31:22.783 --> 02:31:23.603]  It's NSF 42 certified.
[02:31:25.044 --> 02:31:28.327]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[02:31:28.327 --> 02:31:30.149]  Easy to set up and use.
[02:31:30.149 --> 02:31:31.570]  Doesn't require electricity.
[02:31:31.570 --> 02:31:34.733]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[02:31:34.733 --> 02:31:38.116]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[02:31:38.116 --> 02:31:40.018]  Save money by not buying bottled water.
[02:31:40.018 --> 02:31:42.260]  And avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[02:31:42.260 --> 02:31:45.003]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[02:31:45.003 --> 02:31:46.584]  It's what my family uses.
[02:31:46.584 --> 02:31:47.305]  InfoWars.com
[02:31:47.805 --> 02:31:48.766]  Cold and flu season is upon us.

[02:32:20.860 --> 02:32:33.888]  Silver Sol technology is safe enough to consume every day, while powerful enough to destroy the causes of many serious diseases, like strep throat, staph, pneumonia, colds, flus, and other harmful pathogens.
[02:32:33.888 --> 02:32:46.135]  This new technology is much more effective than colloidal or ionic silvers, and has the ability to terminate entire colonies of harmful bacteria at several hundred times the effectiveness of older solutions.

[02:33:08.841 --> 02:33:13.942]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:19.140 --> 02:33:26.885]  Okay, Alex Jones here, back live.
[02:33:26.885 --> 02:33:31.288]  We are racing through some of your calls, and then I'm going to hit a bunch of news.
[02:33:31.288 --> 02:33:44.258]  Tom in Illinois, ex-army and pastor, what is your take on the admitted army manuals for, quote, re-education camps, gun confiscation, preppers being put on no-fly list and being told you can't fly because you're a prepper?
[02:33:44.958 --> 02:33:47.779]  And, you know, we were at your meeting and we're watching you.
[02:33:47.779 --> 02:33:50.160]  Prepping's illegal, even though it's not.
[02:33:50.160 --> 02:33:54.021]  I mean, why would they want us to not be prepared and self-sufficient?
[02:33:54.021 --> 02:33:56.502]  No, they want us all begging for Obama phones, folks.
[02:33:56.502 --> 02:33:58.902]  That's what slavery's all about.
[02:33:58.902 --> 02:34:00.983]  Slaves aren't self-sufficient.
[02:34:00.983 --> 02:34:05.044]  The Soviets shut down economies, the communists, the fascists.
[02:34:05.044 --> 02:34:06.625]  Go ahead, you're on the air, Tom.
[02:34:08.018 --> 02:34:08.638]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:34:08.638 --> 02:34:18.682]  I found you a couple weeks ago, and I gotta tell you, you depressed me and my wife last week, but I feel like I'm awake, and I appreciate what you're doing out here.
[02:34:18.682 --> 02:34:29.446]  I have a friend who stayed in the military for over 20 years, and he's away from his family now and sort of has gone underground, has me a little worried.
[02:34:29.446 --> 02:34:32.427]  Two years ago... Are you there?
[02:34:32.427 --> 02:34:32.727]  Yes, sir.
[02:34:33.629 --> 02:34:52.817]  Two years ago, and I never thought about some of the stuff you're saying that went on until I got a hold of your stuff, but two years ago, driving to Springfield, Illinois, from Southern Illinois to go do a hospital visitation, there was a double to triple blockade on the major interstate.
[02:34:52.817 --> 02:34:58.219]  Guys with naval binoculars on overpasses, and they were stopping vehicles, and they said it was a drug stop.
[02:34:58.923 --> 02:35:06.081]  They searched every inch of every car they stopped, taking guns and all kinds of stuff.
[02:35:06.081 --> 02:35:06.843]  And my brother...
[02:35:07.677 --> 02:35:10.018]  Was part of the cleanup crew, didn't know about that till a month later.
[02:35:10.018 --> 02:35:12.758]  And he said, Hey, did you, you know, did you know what was going on in Interstate 55?
[02:35:12.758 --> 02:35:14.859]  I said, no, you know, yeah, I drove through it.
[02:35:14.859 --> 02:35:16.939]  And he said, I said, how did you know about that?
[02:35:16.939 --> 02:35:19.700]  I said, you don't live around, you know, around there that route.
[02:35:19.700 --> 02:35:25.201]  And he said, I was one of the guys who was on a cleanup crew for that, for this organization.
[02:35:25.201 --> 02:35:26.782]  And he said, it wasn't just about drugs.
[02:35:26.782 --> 02:35:31.463]  And it just kind of thought back to that, where I found you on the internet.
[02:35:32.184 --> 02:35:33.886]  And I was even looking for you.
[02:35:33.886 --> 02:35:36.990]  And I thought you looked familiar.
[02:35:36.990 --> 02:35:40.335]  I remember you from some show.
[02:35:40.335 --> 02:35:42.478]  I can't think of... Brad Meltzer's show.
[02:35:42.478 --> 02:35:44.421]  You showed up on that, so I recognized your face.
[02:35:45.422 --> 02:35:48.143]  And I thought if Meltzer gives this guy credit, then I am in the man cow.
[02:35:48.143 --> 02:35:50.624]  I saw that thing and I thought, OK, this guy has some credibility.
[02:35:50.624 --> 02:36:00.708]  And so some things I'm seeing out here with ex-military friends, like I said, my friend going underground that that blockade on a major interstate where there's nothing in between Springfield and St.
[02:36:00.708 --> 02:36:00.888]  Louis.
[02:36:00.888 --> 02:36:06.230]  I mean, there's literally just cow pastures and fields, corn.
[02:36:06.230 --> 02:36:08.130]  And so I'm a little freaked out.
[02:36:08.130 --> 02:36:10.471]  So one of my questions is, what do you tell a guy?
[02:36:10.471 --> 02:36:15.073]  I'm not an I'm not a tiny, small town, but I'm in a relatively big area in southern Illinois.
[02:36:16.417 --> 02:36:17.697]  What do you tell people like us?
[02:36:17.697 --> 02:36:21.759]  I mean, I believe that martial law can happen.
[02:36:21.759 --> 02:36:41.564]  Well, what they're doing is they're incrementally bringing us into martial law in the public schools, thumbprinting to buy and sell, parents showing IDs, thumbprinting to get in, TSA now at malls, highways, military checkpoints all over the country, and they just do them to make sure the local cops are going to go along with it.
[02:36:41.564 --> 02:36:43.965]  That's really to assess and watch everybody.
[02:36:44.885 --> 02:36:48.947]  They do urban warfare drills, delta force drills, everywhere to acclimate people.
[02:36:48.947 --> 02:36:52.409]  I mean, really, we're just being trained.
[02:36:52.409 --> 02:36:54.251]  The globalists are psychologists.
[02:36:54.251 --> 02:36:59.393]  So it's Skinnerian, Pavlovian, operant conditioning.
[02:36:59.393 --> 02:37:06.277]  And once you understand that, again, they're brainwashing the police, the military, the local constabulary, you, the media.
[02:37:07.598 --> 02:37:17.646]  Just to where we've all seen this so many times, over and over and over again, that we just basically get acclimated to accept it all.
[02:37:17.646 --> 02:37:23.251]  And so you just, you know, explain to people the TSA is there to break your will and train you to be a slave.
[02:37:23.251 --> 02:37:25.553]  And now they search people after the checkpoint.
[02:37:25.553 --> 02:37:27.554]  Now they take your food and test it in your water.
[02:37:27.554 --> 02:37:33.879]  When they see you buy it, you know, at the McDonald's or Burger King or Starbucks, right in the line, they do it.
[02:37:33.879 --> 02:37:35.120]  And it's about, well, this makes no sense.
[02:37:35.120 --> 02:37:35.721]  Well, that's the point.
[02:37:36.201 --> 02:37:37.202]  You do whatever I tell you.
[02:37:37.202 --> 02:37:39.163]  If I tell you jump, you ask how high.
[02:37:39.163 --> 02:37:41.885]  Is that clear, scum?
[02:37:41.885 --> 02:37:44.567]  This is the basic takeover.
[02:37:44.567 --> 02:37:50.452]  Because the globalists have said they're going to implode the world economy while posing as the savior in steps.
[02:37:50.452 --> 02:37:52.333]  Because they've learned they can get away with that.
[02:37:52.333 --> 02:37:54.495]  Because they want you poor.
[02:37:54.495 --> 02:37:57.877]  NAFTA and GATT was meant to de-industrialize us.
[02:37:57.877 --> 02:38:01.640]  Everything is to bring us into a one world government.
[02:38:01.640 --> 02:38:03.482]  And so... Sorry, go ahead.
[02:38:04.278 --> 02:38:08.380]  In Illinois, I interact with a lot of police officers.
[02:38:08.380 --> 02:38:15.143]  And one thing I've noticed in the last year to two years is that the state police are real standoffish and acting very funny.
[02:38:15.143 --> 02:38:16.984]  That's my opinion.
[02:38:16.984 --> 02:38:19.785]  You know, I might get pulled over for a speeding ticket every once in a while.
[02:38:19.785 --> 02:38:21.666]  Cops are generally nice.
[02:38:21.666 --> 02:38:23.047]  Sometimes you get out of it, sometimes you don't.
[02:38:23.047 --> 02:38:27.008]  But the state police are, in my opinion, generally acting very funny lately.
[02:38:27.008 --> 02:38:27.429]  Yeah, I know.
[02:38:27.429 --> 02:38:30.370]  In Illinois, you've got some pretty serious state police.
[02:38:30.370 --> 02:38:31.410]  It's all mafia run.
[02:38:33.083 --> 02:38:39.606]  They're the ones that are anti-gun, they've really picked in Illinois a nasty crew, and that's what it is.
[02:38:39.606 --> 02:38:42.887]  I mean, the state police in most states pretty much are federalized.
[02:38:42.887 --> 02:38:45.769]  Because the new order can't do this if the state police are under their control.
[02:38:45.769 --> 02:38:57.714]  You know, the state police a few years ago tried to stop unspeakable Jerry Sandusky type stuff at the Texas Youth Commission, and the state police wouldn't stop investigating it, so they just replaced the director of it.
[02:38:58.450 --> 02:39:06.835]  I mean, that's the problem with all this, is that bad guys are in charge on top, and we are in so much trouble, I don't have words to describe it.
[02:39:06.835 --> 02:39:08.036]  Thank you for the call.
[02:39:08.036 --> 02:39:20.384]  I've got to get to this again, because I've been mentioning it, and we're going to get that Ted Turner clip ready, because this is such a big issue, and it ties into eugenics, it ties into population reduction, it ties into the massive suicide rates of the tribes.
[02:39:20.384 --> 02:39:25.407]  They know three, four, five, six terrors will really damage psychologically a lot of people.
[02:39:25.407 --> 02:39:26.408]  Then they put them on Prozac.
[02:39:27.189 --> 02:39:34.429]  And that is a hallucinogen-based system, and then you will get some psychotic breaks, which are the vast minority of troops...
[02:39:35.305 --> 02:39:38.766]  I mean, I can't believe they can stand up to what they've been put through.
[02:39:38.766 --> 02:39:40.166]  Most people couldn't.
[02:39:40.166 --> 02:39:44.647]  So I really commend how much they've gone through and held together this much.
[02:39:44.647 --> 02:39:50.628]  They're then going to demonize the veterans in general and take their rights away.
[02:39:50.628 --> 02:39:52.128]  And that's the beta test, okay?
[02:39:52.128 --> 02:39:55.268]  And they're going to flip the entire al-Qaeda narrative onto the troops.
[02:39:55.268 --> 02:39:56.369]  That's now happened.
[02:39:56.369 --> 02:39:59.929]  So here is that Ted Turner clip.
[02:39:59.929 --> 02:40:03.990]  And Paul Watson paused and then put some text in there pointing out some points.
[02:40:03.990 --> 02:40:04.330]  Here it is.
[02:40:05.612 --> 02:40:07.753]  Ted Turner told CNN he thinks it's good that U.S.
[02:40:07.753 --> 02:40:09.233]  troops are killing themselves.
[02:40:09.233 --> 02:40:09.993]  Ted Turner, CNN.
[02:40:09.993 --> 02:40:13.414]  More American servicemen are dying now.
[02:40:13.414 --> 02:40:14.254]  Suicide.
[02:40:14.254 --> 02:40:17.575]  From suicide over there than are dying in combat.
[02:40:17.575 --> 02:40:20.836]  I mean, that's shocking, isn't it?
[02:40:20.836 --> 02:40:33.339]  No, I think it's good because it's so clear that we're programmed and we're born to love and help each other, not to kill each other, destroy each other.
[02:40:33.339 --> 02:40:34.260]  That's an aberration.
[02:40:35.600 --> 02:40:39.004]  Left over from, uh, from hundreds of years ago.
[02:40:39.004 --> 02:40:42.367]  It's time for us to start acting, uh, enlightened.
[02:40:42.367 --> 02:40:46.051]  I was about to say, I think it's terrific.
[02:40:46.051 --> 02:40:46.772]  Listen.
[02:40:46.772 --> 02:40:48.134]  I mean, that's shocking, isn't it?
[02:40:48.134 --> 02:40:51.878]  Well, what, it, it, what, it, no, I think it's, I think it's good.
[02:40:53.266 --> 02:40:54.487]  After saying it's good that U.S.
[02:40:54.487 --> 02:41:01.271]  troops are killing themselves, Turner then advocates the role be usurped by the United Nations with the most murderous record ever.
[02:41:01.271 --> 02:41:05.114]  Ted, what do you think America's place in the New World Order should be?
[02:41:05.114 --> 02:41:08.156]  It's always been seen as the global policeman.
[02:41:08.156 --> 02:41:13.339]  But as you said before, you know, it's hard to see with all these military conflicts where the winner and loser lies.
[02:41:13.339 --> 02:41:15.660]  What should America be doing globally?
[02:41:15.660 --> 02:41:17.942]  I think global policemen should be the United Nations.
[02:41:19.585 --> 02:41:19.905]  U.S.
[02:41:19.905 --> 02:41:22.887]  soldiers commit suicide at a rate of almost one per day.
[02:41:22.887 --> 02:41:24.007]  Is that really a good thing?
[02:41:24.007 --> 02:41:26.228]  No, I think it's good.
[02:41:26.228 --> 02:41:27.209]  Yeah, he says it's good.
[02:41:27.209 --> 02:41:28.710]  So is that really a good thing?
[02:41:28.710 --> 02:41:31.851]  I mean, truly sickening as a link to the full clip on CNN site.
[02:41:31.851 --> 02:41:33.272]  They're proud of this.
[02:41:33.272 --> 02:41:36.074]  And the point is we're just conditioned now to hear that.
[02:41:36.074 --> 02:41:38.755]  I mean, it is beyond sick.
[02:41:38.755 --> 02:41:44.178]  And here's Napolitano in the Washington Times saying, yes, the number one terror threat is veterans.
[02:41:44.178 --> 02:41:44.298]  See?
[02:41:45.495 --> 02:41:46.516]  That's what they think of you.
[02:41:46.516 --> 02:41:47.857]  That's what they think of you.
[02:41:47.857 --> 02:41:57.265]  And now they're getting ready to try to make the police, fire departments, and others take forced inoculations under the Model States Health Emergency Powers Act.
[02:41:57.265 --> 02:42:00.829]  They're back with that now, starting with all the hospital workers.
[02:42:00.829 --> 02:42:06.394]  So look out and realize the government is not your friend.
[02:42:06.394 --> 02:42:07.855]  It is tyrannical.
[02:42:07.855 --> 02:42:10.717]  That's the norm in most countries.
[02:42:10.717 --> 02:42:12.399]  We've got a very nasty case of it.
[02:42:13.812 --> 02:42:16.355]  I mean, the country has cancer.
[02:42:16.355 --> 02:42:17.856]  People say, well, don't be so negative.
[02:42:17.856 --> 02:42:23.742]  Look, we're not going to beat this if we're not honest about it.
[02:42:23.742 --> 02:42:24.983]  And it's very exhausting.
[02:42:24.983 --> 02:42:27.886]  I understand that it's scary for people to admit this, to deal with it.
[02:42:27.886 --> 02:42:31.950]  But I mean, just look at every time there's a crisis or a problem, the government doesn't help.
[02:42:31.950 --> 02:42:33.392]  It makes it worse if it's the feds.
[02:42:34.864 --> 02:42:44.231]  Sometimes local government can do some good because it's local, it knows the people, it knows what's going on, and it wants to have the status quo and prosperity.
[02:42:44.231 --> 02:42:48.073]  The New World Order does not want prosperity for you.
[02:42:48.073 --> 02:42:51.656]  They want you poor, they want to shut down your economy, they want a post-industrial world.
[02:42:52.256 --> 02:42:52.436]  Well,
[02:43:20.782 --> 02:43:26.884]  From our standpoint, I'm one of 47 who resigned from Delta Force a few years back.
[02:43:26.884 --> 02:43:32.505]  And it was due to the fact that we consider this all high treason.
[02:43:32.505 --> 02:43:34.166]  All high treason.
[02:43:34.166 --> 02:43:37.126]  And it's been implemented a lot earlier.
[02:43:37.126 --> 02:43:41.508]  You have done a great job, though, holding it off by exposing.
[02:43:41.508 --> 02:43:46.649]  And we consider you the front lines along with us.
[02:43:49.650 --> 02:43:52.731]  Do you have anything else you'd like to add to the listeners?
[02:43:52.731 --> 02:43:54.011]  Yeah.
[02:43:54.011 --> 02:44:00.073]  This has actually been in implementation since 2006.
[02:44:00.073 --> 02:44:16.497]  What they don't know is that they're intentionally, one of the reasons why we designed, we found out that they were trying to keep our military forces abroad so they wouldn't be home for this conduct that they're committing right now.
[02:44:16.497 --> 02:44:18.037]  I can't go into a lot of details.
[02:44:19.514 --> 02:44:26.218]  But you have been on the mark and it does, it does rattle some chains.
[02:44:26.218 --> 02:44:36.585]  I was in Special Activities Division and we got wind of certain things like Petrie Media Corporation.
[02:44:36.585 --> 02:44:40.528]  We knew what they were doing.
[02:44:40.528 --> 02:44:42.669]  They're just changing the faces.
[02:44:42.669 --> 02:44:46.191]  It's the same people at the top.
[02:44:46.191 --> 02:44:48.553]  And what is their goal from what you were able to discover?
[02:44:50.373 --> 02:44:54.075]  Well, they've been doing this, uh, when we went down to Central America.
[02:44:54.075 --> 02:45:04.620]  We saw the same things that they're doing now, but they're taking a different path with us as they did down in Central America.
[02:45:04.620 --> 02:45:10.542]  When I was over in Somalia, we gave them the intel.
[02:45:10.542 --> 02:45:18.446]  They said that they were expendable and we went back in on our own and we tried to get as many out.
[02:45:19.878 --> 02:45:23.499]  This, this is going to be big.
[02:45:23.499 --> 02:45:30.921]  It's going to be big and keeping it in a peaceful manner is the best solution.
[02:45:30.921 --> 02:45:42.264]  But if there's a way to keep some kind of deterrent with numbers, they see enough civilians armed, perhaps we might not be able to have to use that.
[02:45:42.264 --> 02:45:45.445]  No one wants to fight their brothers and sisters.
[02:45:45.445 --> 02:45:46.905]  Military vets that are over there,
[02:45:47.975 --> 02:45:51.937]  They were chasing ghosts in Afghanistan.
[02:45:51.937 --> 02:45:56.399]  We were over there a couple years before then.
[02:45:56.399 --> 02:46:07.264]  And later on, we got intel that some of the Marines that were over there, we worked a little bit with SOG and so forth.
[02:46:07.264 --> 02:46:09.365]  They were telling us that they were looking for ghosts.
[02:46:09.365 --> 02:46:13.167]  I was like, well, I couldn't say anything.
[02:46:13.167 --> 02:46:17.049]  But there was no other reason.
[02:46:17.691 --> 02:46:22.736]  Then, uh, looking for the resources, let's say.
[02:46:22.736 --> 02:46:23.296]  Well, that's it.
[02:46:23.296 --> 02:46:24.818]  I mean, it's a simulant.
[02:46:24.818 --> 02:46:27.940]  You go in, you kill enough innocent people, they're going to start fighting back.
[02:46:27.940 --> 02:46:29.382]  You call them Al Qaeda.
[02:46:29.382 --> 02:46:31.423]  Meanwhile, real Al Qaeda works for you.
[02:46:31.423 --> 02:46:32.745]  That's full-spectrum dominance.
[02:46:32.745 --> 02:46:36.368]  You've got to create the conflict, even have an excuse to be there.
[02:46:36.368 --> 02:46:43.735]  And then, I've talked to so many military people, and it came out in the news years after I was told this, they would go and say, this is the first time we're going to blow up this
[02:46:44.335 --> 02:46:47.456]  Well, the UN Special Forces have been here for a while, as you know.
[02:46:47.456 --> 02:46:48.536]  They've had NATO here for a while.
[02:46:48.536 --> 02:46:55.317]  A couple of us who caught up with each other years later decided to go and look for ourselves as well.
[02:46:55.317 --> 02:46:56.897]  And you're right about FEMA camps.
[02:47:13.925 --> 02:47:17.293]  There's no reason to have the razor wire facing in.
[02:47:17.293 --> 02:47:19.177]  And they're actually manned and up and running.
[02:47:20.429 --> 02:47:21.650]  No, no, no.
[02:47:21.650 --> 02:47:24.091]  We've listed some, like in Kansas and other places.
[02:47:24.091 --> 02:47:29.874]  They call them military police training facilities, but they're building giant areas.
[02:47:29.874 --> 02:47:33.056]  We've actually talked to insiders that sent us photos, videos.
[02:47:33.056 --> 02:47:38.319]  It's in the Army Times that they've set up emergency centers for collapse.
[02:47:38.319 --> 02:47:45.523]  It's called the Emergency Centers Establishment Act, which just legally increases funding for what's already been built.
[02:47:45.523 --> 02:47:46.344]  Well, good to hear from you.
[02:47:46.344 --> 02:47:46.784]  Anything else?
[02:47:47.734 --> 02:47:55.422]  Yeah, the information you had brought up a few times I've heard about China, Japan and our fleet over there.
[02:47:55.422 --> 02:47:56.463]  Yes.
[02:47:56.463 --> 02:48:02.209]  They were there in December 2008 and the Chinese were actually interrupting
[02:48:03.241 --> 02:48:04.522]  Uh, the training.
[02:48:04.522 --> 02:48:07.444]  The flight simulations for combat.
[02:48:07.444 --> 02:48:09.866]  And, uh, they were flying right over the aircraft.
[02:48:09.866 --> 02:48:11.447]  They've been there since December 2008.
[02:48:11.447 --> 02:48:13.849]  This isn't new.
[02:48:13.849 --> 02:48:15.510]  This has been there for a while.
[02:48:15.510 --> 02:48:16.971]  No, I know, but it's really building up.
[02:48:16.971 --> 02:48:17.372]  You're right.
[02:48:17.372 --> 02:48:19.113]  Well, listen, good to hear from you.
[02:48:19.113 --> 02:48:20.154]  Very interesting information.
[02:48:20.874 --> 02:48:22.435]  I know we got a bunch of other calls here.
[02:48:22.435 --> 02:48:25.438]  Let's just go to John in Ohio and then I'll come back and hit some news.
[02:48:25.438 --> 02:48:27.599]  Just makes my head spin.
[02:48:27.599 --> 02:48:31.502]  Let's go ahead and talk to John, ex-Special Forces as well in Ohio.
[02:48:31.502 --> 02:48:34.284]  Go ahead, give us your take on all this.
[02:48:34.284 --> 02:48:35.165]  Hi Alex.
[02:48:35.165 --> 02:48:37.007]  I've been listening for a while.
[02:48:37.007 --> 02:48:38.047]  First time calling.
[02:48:39.201 --> 02:48:43.486]  I wanted to talk about, you've been bringing up how they want to demonize veterans.
[02:48:43.486 --> 02:48:44.467]  Yes.
[02:48:44.467 --> 02:48:47.711]  And I got a firsthand account of that.
[02:48:47.711 --> 02:48:48.471]  It's true.
[02:48:48.471 --> 02:48:52.556]  It's happening.
[02:48:52.556 --> 02:48:55.539]  When I came back, I moved to a small town to go to college.
[02:48:56.836 --> 02:48:59.778]  I was getting harassed by the police a lot.
[02:48:59.778 --> 02:49:03.961]  Finally, they raided me with no warrant.
[02:49:03.961 --> 02:49:05.742]  I never saw a warrant.
[02:49:05.742 --> 02:49:09.765]  They were not dressed as police officers.
[02:49:09.765 --> 02:49:12.126]  They did not show badges when they came in.
[02:49:12.126 --> 02:49:16.249]  They were heavily armed, machine guns, guns drawn.
[02:49:16.249 --> 02:49:16.970]  I had a gun.
[02:49:16.970 --> 02:49:21.212]  At first, I thought someone was breaking into my house.
[02:49:21.212 --> 02:49:23.114]  I almost pulled it.
[02:49:23.114 --> 02:49:25.836]  So later, they said that I'm lucky they didn't shoot me.
[02:49:26.840 --> 02:49:28.300]  They confiscated my gun.
[02:49:28.300 --> 02:49:30.861]  Now they say I can't have a gun.
[02:49:30.861 --> 02:49:32.801]  Yeah, by the way, this is happening everywhere.
[02:49:32.801 --> 02:49:35.702]  No judge, no jury, no PSD.
[02:49:35.702 --> 02:49:37.422]  You just don't have a gun anymore.
[02:49:37.422 --> 02:49:41.023]  I mean, they just do whatever they want because they said so.
[02:49:41.023 --> 02:49:46.844]  Right, and so then I contacted, you know, a lawyer and I dug into this.
[02:49:46.844 --> 02:49:52.965]  And the lawyer comes back to me and says that I'm classified when they run my name.
[02:49:54.046 --> 02:50:05.153]  As a level three threat to contact higher authority if local police run into me to contact state police or SWAT team or something.
[02:50:05.153 --> 02:50:06.174]  Yeah, that's what they do now.
[02:50:06.174 --> 02:50:08.375]  They just put everybody in databases.
[02:50:08.375 --> 02:50:10.997]  These databases have been ruled illegal but...
[02:50:12.077 --> 02:50:16.600]  The intelligence groups and police departments, all of them have these, and a lot of it's just lies.
[02:50:16.600 --> 02:50:18.281]  But no, it's no judge, no jury.
[02:50:18.281 --> 02:50:19.422]  That's the no-fly list.
[02:50:19.422 --> 02:50:21.443]  That's the no-gun-buy list.
[02:50:21.443 --> 02:50:24.685]  That's just, you're on a list, you don't get a job now.
[02:50:24.685 --> 02:50:26.866]  That's the essence of authoritarianism.
[02:50:26.866 --> 02:50:30.348]  The IRS is announcing, we're not going to let you have a job if we just say you owe.
[02:50:30.348 --> 02:50:31.729]  You can't leave the country.
[02:50:31.729 --> 02:50:34.191]  You can't take legal money out of the country now.
[02:50:35.829 --> 02:50:38.571]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:50:38.571 --> 02:50:40.312]  I know that I'm in a database.
[02:50:40.312 --> 02:50:42.194]  My lawyer told me I'm on a list.
[02:50:42.194 --> 02:50:43.895]  They think I'm an animal.
[02:50:43.895 --> 02:50:48.058]  And I've never committed a violent crime or a drug-related crime.
[02:50:48.058 --> 02:50:49.559]  Did you kill a lot of people?
[02:50:49.559 --> 02:50:53.422]  Did you kill a lot of people in combat?
[02:50:53.422 --> 02:50:56.224]  Yes, and he said that... Hold on, I want to hear more of this.
[02:50:56.224 --> 02:50:57.024]  I want to hear more of it.
[02:50:57.024 --> 02:50:57.404]  Stay with us.
[02:50:57.404 --> 02:50:57.885]  We'll be right back.
[02:51:01.147 --> 02:51:07.290]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[02:51:07.290 --> 02:51:10.252]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[02:51:10.252 --> 02:51:15.654]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[02:51:15.654 --> 02:51:18.916]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business.
[02:51:19.076 --> 02:51:20.617]  Blowing up your food prices.
[02:51:20.617 --> 02:51:28.244]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from eFoods Direct now.
[02:51:28.244 --> 02:51:32.127]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[02:51:32.127 --> 02:51:33.908]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[02:51:33.908 --> 02:51:37.932]  I recently increased my supply from eFoods Direct because we've all known this was coming.
[02:51:37.932 --> 02:51:40.534]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.
[02:51:40.834 --> 02:51:43.615]  The fact is, you can eat it anytime to save money today.
[02:51:43.615 --> 02:51:48.156]  And because it's stored for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food costs.
[02:51:48.156 --> 02:51:48.817]  Don't wait!
[02:51:48.817 --> 02:51:54.058]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.

[02:52:08.739 --> 02:52:17.713]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.

[02:53:29.810 --> 02:53:31.051]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:53:31.051 --> 02:53:35.614]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:53:35.614 --> 02:53:41.418]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:53:41.418 --> 02:53:45.060]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:53:45.060 --> 02:53:47.782]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:53:47.782 --> 02:53:52.865]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:53:52.865 --> 02:53:53.166]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:53:53.166 --> 02:53:54.527]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:54:04.413 --> 02:54:10.978]  Let me give you some numbers.
[02:54:10.978 --> 02:54:14.641]  HR 645 Emergency Centers Establishment Act.
[02:54:21.357 --> 02:54:33.748]  Army Regulation 210-35 Civilian Inmate Labor Camp Program, FM 3-39.4, internment, re-education camps for America.
[02:54:33.748 --> 02:54:35.130]  I mean, it's public!
[02:54:35.130 --> 02:54:37.052]  Where's all the mainstream media?
[02:54:37.052 --> 02:54:42.096]  I mean, I'm on stations all over the country.
[02:54:42.096 --> 02:54:43.517]  Where are local newspaper reporters?
[02:54:43.517 --> 02:54:45.319]  You're hearing this.
[02:54:45.319 --> 02:54:46.820]  You know that's authoritarianism.
[02:54:47.915 --> 02:54:48.615]  Call my bluff.
[02:54:48.615 --> 02:54:49.516]  Go read the articles.
[02:54:49.516 --> 02:54:53.538]  Go read the manuals that are on the Army website.
[02:54:53.538 --> 02:54:59.161]  And then, you know, go to your editor and say, I'm going to write an article about the FEMA camps.
[02:54:59.161 --> 02:55:01.642]  Because, see, that's what stops them.
[02:55:01.642 --> 02:55:03.263]  People are like, well, that couldn't be true.
[02:55:03.263 --> 02:55:04.443]  I'm not going to look it up.
[02:55:04.443 --> 02:55:06.964]  No, it is true.
[02:55:06.964 --> 02:55:08.605]  It is true.
[02:55:08.605 --> 02:55:11.507]  John, real fast, because I've got a piece of news or two I want to hit here.
[02:55:13.762 --> 02:55:15.222]  Look, it's not just you.
[02:55:15.222 --> 02:55:25.307]  I was talking to a famous professional football guy at a little party event, former famous UT football player.
[02:55:25.307 --> 02:55:26.768]  This guy's older.
[02:55:26.768 --> 02:55:29.029]  And he was like, yeah, I'm trying to buy my grandson a 22.
[02:55:29.029 --> 02:55:34.511]  And they said, because I was in Vietnam, I couldn't have one now, and I'm on a list.
[02:55:34.511 --> 02:55:35.992]  I have no criminal record.
[02:55:35.992 --> 02:55:37.312]  And that's just how it is.
[02:55:37.312 --> 02:55:39.073]  You're an American enemy.
[02:55:39.073 --> 02:55:40.074]  So you don't get a gun.
[02:55:41.007 --> 02:55:46.769]  And they're just doing it, so... And they go tell these young cops or whatever that you're the enemy, and some of them buy into it.
[02:55:46.769 --> 02:55:53.012]  Most police are waking up because of this, but you're gonna see some of the hopped up troops go crazy, so that'll be the excuse.
[02:55:53.012 --> 02:55:56.293]  You know, I mean, it'd be kind of like if a red-haired guy killed somebody.
[02:55:56.293 --> 02:55:57.714]  All redheads have to go to prison.
[02:55:58.354 --> 02:55:59.215]  Well, it took me three lawyers.
[02:55:59.215 --> 02:56:00.196]  The first two, they wouldn't tell me why
[02:56:23.360 --> 02:56:26.402]  Uh, you know, that I was classified like this and I was on a list.
[02:56:26.402 --> 02:56:28.143]  They wouldn't tell me that.
[02:56:28.143 --> 02:56:36.608]  It took, uh, you know, a lot of money and getting a big name lawyer to come in from across the country to find this stuff out.
[02:56:36.608 --> 02:56:39.009]  And then he was willing to tell me and he told me, he said,
[02:56:39.784 --> 02:56:42.825]  The police there, the local police, they're scared of you.
[02:56:42.825 --> 02:56:44.825]  They consider you armed and dangerous.
[02:56:44.825 --> 02:56:49.887]  Well, that's because the feds tell them that all day, which is going to become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[02:56:49.887 --> 02:56:50.527]  God bless you.
[02:56:50.527 --> 02:56:52.548]  I appreciate your call.
[02:56:52.548 --> 02:56:56.969]  This is how they're going to try to start a civil war right here, harassing people.
[02:56:56.969 --> 02:56:59.930]  But I mean, it was the same thing after Vietnam and other wars.
[02:56:59.930 --> 02:57:01.670]  That is so accurate.
[02:57:01.670 --> 02:57:03.771]  What?
[02:57:03.771 --> 02:57:04.291]  Well, I guess.
[02:57:07.116 --> 02:57:13.443]  You know, the writer of the movie First Blood, Sylvester Stallone, he wrote that.
[02:57:13.443 --> 02:57:20.831]  I mean, that story of the special forces guy walking through the town and the police chief says, let me take you to the end of town.
[02:57:20.831 --> 02:57:21.612]  Why don't you get out of here?
[02:57:21.612 --> 02:57:24.355]  I mean, that's exactly the type of stuff goes on.
[02:57:24.355 --> 02:57:26.258]  See, it's all how much they love the troops.
[02:57:27.503 --> 02:57:30.084]  But then, they're all a bunch of cowards.
[02:57:30.084 --> 02:57:36.287]  Those type of people, they hate you, because they're all into authority and power and dominating people, bad cops.
[02:57:36.287 --> 02:57:40.749]  And so the feds are going to come in and teach them, yeah, the military, the veterans, they're bad, because they're scared of you.
[02:57:40.749 --> 02:57:42.690]  They are, and it's pathetic.
[02:57:42.690 --> 02:57:44.290]  It's absolutely pathetic.
[02:57:44.290 --> 02:57:50.173]  You send people off for these big illegal wars that kill a bunch of people, and then you're scared of them.
[02:57:50.173 --> 02:57:54.635]  And then it's going to become a self-fulfilling prophecy, messing with them, where you're going to end up having to fight them.
[02:57:56.840 --> 02:57:58.920]  By the way, Jesse Ventura called me during the last segment.
[02:57:58.920 --> 02:58:07.262]  I need to call him back right when this hour ends and look for getting him on with some breaking news, probably tomorrow, not Sunday or Monday.
[02:58:07.262 --> 02:58:10.023]  But, man, I didn't get to some of the news in this hour.
[02:58:10.023 --> 02:58:14.443]  It's all up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:58:14.443 --> 02:58:16.264]  Greece is just disintegrating.
[02:58:16.264 --> 02:58:20.865]  The Secret Service is now launching a task force on all the tweets and death threats.
[02:58:22.481 --> 02:58:26.204]  Secret Service sets up a hotline for suspicious web posts.
[02:58:26.204 --> 02:58:27.285]  But it's not suspicious.
[02:58:27.285 --> 02:58:28.506]  How about actual death threats?
[02:58:28.506 --> 02:58:30.768]  No, they'll harass people for saying the sky's blue.
[02:58:30.768 --> 02:58:31.729]  Watch.
[02:58:31.729 --> 02:58:34.551]  And a bunch of other key news on the economy and this hurricane.
