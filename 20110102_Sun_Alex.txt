[00:00.000 --> 00:08.680]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08.680 --> 00:12.640]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:12.640 --> 00:21.160]  We are locked and loaded first live, transmission of 2011.
[00:21.160 --> 00:22.720]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:22.720 --> 00:24.600]  We're going to be here live for the next two hours.
[00:24.600 --> 00:29.960]  It is the abbreviated Sunday transmission, now doing the show for over three years.
[00:29.960 --> 00:39.880]  From 4 to 6 p.m. Central Standard Time, and of course, we've now been on the air off and on for more than 15 years.
[00:39.880 --> 00:48.880]  Hard to believe, since 1995, and I've been doing radio money through Friday since 1998.
[00:48.880 --> 00:58.480]  So going into our 13th year now of that, of course, weekdays, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central Standard Time.
[00:58.480 --> 01:05.680]  And this will be the year that we launch our daily news TV show and our weekly, highly produced TV show, 2011.
[01:05.680 --> 01:10.960]  Lord willing, hopefully early in 2011, will be the year that we launch that as well.
[01:10.960 --> 01:15.800]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[01:15.800 --> 01:18.520]  It'll seem like five minutes from now we'll be announcing.
[01:18.520 --> 01:23.480]  It is the first day of 2012, 2012.
[01:23.480 --> 01:26.880]  Thank you for joining us, but here we are.
[01:26.880 --> 01:29.200]  Have the stacks all here in front of me.
[01:29.200 --> 01:34.360]  Big sis photocopies credit cards confiscates Christmas calendars.
[01:34.360 --> 01:42.360]  And we have the video of Homeland Security admitting that they now will randomly take your, not just your ID and your passport,
[01:42.360 --> 01:44.960]  but your credit cards and photocopy those as well.
[01:44.960 --> 01:49.560]  This on the heels of them grabbing people's cell phones and downloading everything on them.
[01:49.560 --> 01:55.360]  Laptops, no judge, no jury, no warrant, total goon force.
[01:55.360 --> 02:02.880]  I did some searching and did confirm that Homeland Security is now digging through general mail domestically and internationally.
[02:02.880 --> 02:08.320]  My mother three, four weeks ago went on a trip to Europe with one of her friends.
[02:08.320 --> 02:20.680]  And while she was over in Europe, I guess for Christmas, they mailed back a, a advent calendar, a Christmas calendar where every day of Christmas has a piece of chocolate in it.
[02:20.680 --> 02:27.440]  And my mother's friend Homeland Security got very, very upset, sent him a letter and then said, you're not allowed to do that.
[02:27.440 --> 02:29.080]  It could be terrorism.
[02:29.080 --> 02:30.560]  Chocolate is very evil.
[02:30.560 --> 02:35.000]  So they know they can set the precedent to just do outrageous things.
[02:35.000 --> 02:38.680]  They can do anything stick their hands down your pants.
[02:38.680 --> 02:39.880]  What's coming next?
[02:39.880 --> 02:42.440]  Well, it will be DNA database thing.
[02:42.440 --> 02:44.800]  And that's already on the books as an executive order.
[02:44.800 --> 02:47.520]  So we're going to be breaking that down today.
[02:47.520 --> 03:09.880]  Also, we learned in what the ninth of December last year, wow, last year, 2010, last year now, take some getting used to that, that the film machete was denied tax breaks in the state of Texas, the race war, Mexican supremacist film by Robert Rodriguez here in Austin.
[03:09.880 --> 03:22.880]  And since then, there's been some aftermath of that and the star machete Danny Trejo making comments about jokingly about wanting to kill the Texas Film Commission.
[03:22.880 --> 03:25.880]  We hope it's a joke that's in the Hollywood reporter.
[03:25.880 --> 03:41.880]  And I wanted to discuss this little bit in a little bit more detail coming up as well and also get into some of the new laws going into play in different states and federally and internationally in 2011.
[03:41.880 --> 03:48.880]  And I also want to open the phones up throughout the two hours specifically with really what we covered Friday.
[03:48.880 --> 03:51.880]  I thought it was interesting and was sad that the show ended when I did an extra hour.
[03:51.880 --> 03:53.880]  We had four hours on Friday.
[03:53.880 --> 04:10.880]  What do you think some of the most important developments were not just stories, but developments in 2010 and what are your predictions for 2012, what 2011 and what are your resolutions for 2011.
[04:10.880 --> 04:12.880]  2010 is gone.
[04:12.880 --> 04:13.880]  It's now 2011.
[04:13.880 --> 04:17.880]  Here comes 2012 down the road.
[04:17.880 --> 04:28.880]  Later in the broadcast, I'm going to write a note so don't let me forget guys, I will also give you my take on what 2012 is going to bring and do I put any stock in the whole Mayan calendar and the rest of it.
[04:28.880 --> 04:31.880]  That is all coming up today.
[04:31.880 --> 04:41.880]  We also again have some of the announcements of the new Congress set to be going in in just a few weeks.
[04:41.880 --> 04:48.880]  So that is all coming up. Glad you joined us for the first live transmission of 2011.
[04:48.880 --> 04:50.880]  Not 2010, not 2012.
[04:50.880 --> 04:52.880]  I've got to get that straight.
[04:52.880 --> 05:15.880]  In 2011, stay with us. We'll be right back.
[05:22.880 --> 05:47.880]  We'll be right back.
[05:47.880 --> 05:59.880]  That's H-O-M-E-G-A-I-N-150.com.
[05:59.880 --> 06:10.880]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show because there's a war on for your mind.
[06:10.880 --> 06:17.880]  This is it, our inaugural maiden voyage in 2011.
[06:17.880 --> 06:21.880]  It is the second day of January, 2011.
[06:21.880 --> 06:23.880]  That's going to take some getting used to.
[06:23.880 --> 06:31.880]  And we're going to be live here for the next two hours and we're going to open the phones up with what you think was the most important developments in 2010.
[06:31.880 --> 06:43.880]  What your predictions are for 2011, what your personal societal or political or even personal resolutions are in this new year.
[06:43.880 --> 06:49.880]  And folks can say, well, it's just a date on a calendar, an arbitrary Gregorian calendar.
[06:49.880 --> 06:58.880]  2011 years since the death of Christ were the common era, as the historians now call it.
[06:58.880 --> 07:02.880]  But these are the signposts. These are the markers in our lives.
[07:02.880 --> 07:18.880]  And I have this vivid memory of being four years old sitting there in Dallas, Texas on San Fernando Way on that little quiet street, sitting there on the counter while my mother was mixing up a cake.
[07:18.880 --> 07:28.880]  And her being so young and I was looking up at her and waiting for her to give me some of the cake batter when she was done.
[07:28.880 --> 07:33.880]  As she was sitting there blending and mixing and her looking at me smiling with red lipstick on.
[07:33.880 --> 07:43.880]  I just have this image in my mind and saying, what's it going to be like in the year 2000, 2001, the new millennium, Alex?
[07:43.880 --> 07:48.880]  You're going to be big. You're going to be 26 years old.
[07:48.880 --> 07:58.880]  And now the year 2000, the year 2001, the real star of the new millennia is old news. Why? It's the past.
[07:58.880 --> 08:03.880]  And I know we've all had those similar experiences, but life is so short.
[08:03.880 --> 08:12.880]  And we're only here once and life is a test and it's about leaving the world a better place than when we first got here.
[08:12.880 --> 08:19.880]  And it's about caring about our species and our society and standing up for justice and the family and private property.
[08:19.880 --> 08:29.880]  Those things that are the true engines of a happy free society, the true engines of everything that is good.
[08:29.880 --> 08:37.880]  And the exciting news, as I said Friday and I'll say it again here live on our first broadcast of 2011.
[08:37.880 --> 08:45.880]  I've been fighting the globalist for now 16 years and I can tell you with pure confidence and Ron Paul agrees.
[08:45.880 --> 08:48.880]  Lou Rockwell agrees. Judge Andrew Napolitano agrees.
[08:48.880 --> 08:55.880]  Many other political analysts who have true gravitas and, you know, a handle on the societal developments.
[08:55.880 --> 09:02.880]  We all agree 2010 was the big year of awakening, political awakening.
[09:02.880 --> 09:10.880]  Hardly anybody laughs at you now when you talk about corruption and world government and the fact that this country is going in the wrong direction.
[09:10.880 --> 09:19.880]  And now because the majority of people will at least admit there's a problem, we can set about trying to fix that problem.
[09:19.880 --> 09:29.880]  We can set about now trying to reverse the global social engineering, the corporate fascism that uses socialism at the grassroots
[09:29.880 --> 09:39.880]  to make us domesticated and dependent on the mega corporations that are waging war against the true free market through the Republican and Democratic parties,
[09:39.880 --> 09:45.880]  through labor and the Tories in England and through all the other major political parties of the planet.
[09:45.880 --> 09:54.880]  That's why we see total continuity of agenda, the same land grabbing programs, the same environmental programs, the same police state programs.
[09:54.880 --> 10:02.880]  It's a continuity of agenda worldwide and the population of this planet is waking up big time to that.
[10:02.880 --> 10:12.880]  So 2010 was the year of big time awakening, but at the same time it was also a lot of that awakening happened
[10:12.880 --> 10:19.880]  because the globalists came right out in the open and announced world government, announced that they were planning to devalue the dollar,
[10:19.880 --> 10:25.880]  announced that the police state was here to stay and announced so many truly horrible things that it shook.
[10:25.880 --> 10:40.880]  A lot of people that were in kind of mind numb zombie days out of that mesmerized daydreaming morass that so many, that so many had been in.
[10:40.880 --> 10:45.880]  Let me just do this. Let me just give you the toll free number to join us on air today.
[10:45.880 --> 10:53.880]  888-201-2244, 888-201-2244, and we'll get you up and on the air.
[10:53.880 --> 11:00.880]  First time callers, long time callers, doesn't matter, but specifically I hope that you would, that's a wide field of topics there.
[11:00.880 --> 11:09.880]  We don't screen your calls, but I mean I can tell you I will get a bit irritated if you call up and ask me about Easter bunnies or something.
[11:09.880 --> 11:17.880]  I mean I really want to talk about all the serious things that happened last year and take stock of that and where we see this society going in the new year,
[11:17.880 --> 11:26.880]  namely the Republicans. Are they going to reverse that government takeover of healthcare with the government now announcing even the New York Times that,
[11:26.880 --> 11:32.880]  hey, death panels are real and they're good? People always say, well why are you covering mainstream media if they lie?
[11:32.880 --> 11:40.880]  They only lie part of the time. Most of the time they tell you that breaking up families is good and having abortions is great.
[11:40.880 --> 11:47.880]  They have a new show on MTV about how fun and stylish it is. Why? It's like getting a new hairstyle. Everybody's got to get one.
[11:47.880 --> 11:52.880]  How great warrantless checkpoints are with police taking your blood.
[11:52.880 --> 12:05.880]  I mean nine times out of ten the media tells the truth. They just put a spin on it of how great tyranny is, how great it is to have open borders with the lawlessness in Mexico collapsing into the U.S.
[12:05.880 --> 12:12.880]  How great it is to have sodium fluoride in your water when all the big studies admit it massively increases cancer.
[12:12.880 --> 12:21.880]  That's my perspective on it. If people think NAFTA and GATT have been great, if people think globalism has been wonderful, then more power to you.
[12:21.880 --> 12:34.880]  But again, the number 888-201-2244, if you missed it, and we will open the phone system up and take your phone calls coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[12:34.880 --> 12:43.880]  Okay, let me just read through some of the headlines here too that we'll be going into more detail as the hours elapse here.
[12:43.880 --> 12:59.880]  Big sis, photocopies credit cards. It's on video, Homeland Security, Renacops, the TSA are now copying your credit cards, downloading the contents of your laptop, demanding the code key to your cell phone,
[12:59.880 --> 13:06.880]  and they're slurping it all down onto their computers. No judge, no jury, no laws to allow them to do this.
[13:06.880 --> 13:15.880]  It's just all naked abuse of power in these little reservations they've carved out for themselves to engage in lawlessness to set the precedent.
[13:15.880 --> 13:22.880]  That's a Paul Joseph Watson article out Sunday, January 2nd. And we have links to the mainstream articles admitting they just download your laptops with no warrant.
[13:22.880 --> 13:31.880]  They just photocopy your credit cards. We have videos of flyers pulling out their own camera and videotaping. Why are you copying my credit cards?
[13:31.880 --> 13:37.880]  And they just say, we'll do what we want. That's the way it is. We're going to be breaking that down.
[13:37.880 --> 13:53.880]  And something big that ties into this that my mother witnessed with her good friend of many years, Catherine, tried to mail back a holiday calendar from Germany,
[13:53.880 --> 14:03.880]  one of the advent calendars that has little windows for kids with the chocolate candy inside and Homeland Security sent her a letter and said, no, you will not be getting that.
[14:03.880 --> 14:13.880]  We've confiscated it, and they went on to describe because some of the hundreds of calendars put out by this company have little toys, little wooden toys in the windows,
[14:13.880 --> 14:20.880]  and those might make a child choke. So again, it's all in the name of protecting the children.
[14:20.880 --> 14:27.880]  It has nothing to do with that. It's about seizing control of the infrastructure and architecture of this society.
[14:27.880 --> 14:34.880]  I thought TSA and Homeland Security was fighting al-Qaeda. Oh, now we have the AP headline.
[14:34.880 --> 14:43.880]  Fox News is well reported on it. $15 million fines for garage sales. Don't believe me. Just search that term. We'll get mainstream news.
[14:43.880 --> 14:51.880]  And they say, oh, there's tens of thousands of recalled toys. And if they catch you in your garage sale or your gun show or your flea market,
[14:51.880 --> 15:00.880]  selling one $15 million fine jail time when no one even knows what toys have been recalled. And where is the federal jurisdiction?
[15:00.880 --> 15:08.880]  But then meanwhile, all these Chinese toys with lead and mercury in them, those are fine shots for kids with mercury and all these other chemicals.
[15:08.880 --> 15:15.880]  That's fine. The drug insert admits it's causing tenfold increase in seizures in children, just the flu shots alone.
[15:15.880 --> 15:25.880]  But that doesn't matter. No, no, no. The feds have to take control of all commerce, read all your mail, tear through everything you're doing
[15:25.880 --> 15:30.880]  because they want to take care of you. They want to keep you safe.
[15:30.880 --> 15:38.880]  When we come back, this is the year where California completely outlaws the incandescent light bulbs.
[15:38.880 --> 15:45.880]  That pleasing light that mirrors the light of a fire or a candle. That great Thomas Edison invention.
[15:45.880 --> 15:50.880]  You must use mercury filled, deadly headache causing toxic light bulbs.
[15:50.880 --> 15:59.880]  Oh, and guess what? The governments announced they could get data down the power lines and surveil you in your house with the light bulbs.
[15:59.880 --> 16:04.880]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[16:04.880 --> 16:08.880]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[16:08.880 --> 16:15.880]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true.
[16:15.880 --> 16:20.880]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[16:20.880 --> 16:24.880]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[16:24.880 --> 16:31.880]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[16:31.880 --> 16:35.880]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[16:35.880 --> 16:40.880]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[16:40.880 --> 16:45.880]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors.
[16:45.880 --> 16:51.880]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.
[16:51.880 --> 17:00.880]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[17:00.880 --> 17:08.880]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance to not relive history.
[17:08.880 --> 17:13.880]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[17:13.880 --> 17:19.880]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[17:19.880 --> 17:24.880]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[17:24.880 --> 17:34.880]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[17:34.880 --> 17:41.880]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and Arsonists, they're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[17:41.880 --> 17:48.880]  Today, it seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[17:48.880 --> 17:59.880]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com, or watch it online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[18:01.880 --> 18:05.880]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[18:05.880 --> 18:14.880]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[18:14.880 --> 18:18.880]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[18:18.880 --> 18:30.880]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[18:30.880 --> 18:39.880]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[18:39.880 --> 18:45.880]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[18:45.880 --> 18:52.880]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[18:52.880 --> 19:10.880]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[19:23.880 --> 19:30.880]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[19:30.880 --> 19:37.880]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener.
[19:37.880 --> 19:41.880]  I can't stress this enough. You should at least watch this free video online today.
[19:41.880 --> 19:45.880]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[19:45.880 --> 19:53.880]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com. That's endofamerica. The number 3.com.
[19:53.880 --> 20:17.880]  Watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com. That's endofamerica3.com.
[20:24.880 --> 20:31.880]  Rallying Patriots Worldwide.
[20:31.880 --> 20:38.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:38.880 --> 20:46.880]  Okay, we're back live and I'm going to go ahead and go to your calls early in this hour because you know I can talk for 2-3 hours and never get to your calls.
[20:46.880 --> 20:56.880]  And then I'm going to news blitz coming up at the start of the next hour and then we'll continue with calls, but I want to hear from folks here on our first live show of 2011.
[20:56.880 --> 20:58.880]  And that's going to take some getting used to.
[20:58.880 --> 21:08.880]  But you did hear me right and I'll cover this more later, fluorescent bulbs to be the only bulbs sold next year.
[21:08.880 --> 21:17.880]  And this is nationally starting in 2012. They're going to be phased out and completely banned by 2014.
[21:17.880 --> 21:24.880]  And guess what? Europe's banning them. Australia's already banned them. This is all under UN agreements.
[21:24.880 --> 21:29.880]  And what is in the Food Safety Act? What's been added to the bill that's passed the House?
[21:29.880 --> 21:39.880]  It says in the Senate version that's now passed the House, we read this on air with Mike Adams, the health ranger earlier this week, showed you the bill.
[21:39.880 --> 21:45.880]  In the Food Safety Act written by Big Agribusiness openly to shut down small farms and ranches.
[21:45.880 --> 21:56.880]  It says to comply with the United Nations Agreement Codex Alimentarius, which actually bans over the counter sale of Vitamin C, Vitamin B, and things like that.
[21:56.880 --> 22:04.880]  Just total control. Well, what do you think big industry does? They come lobby to make you buy their vaccines.
[22:04.880 --> 22:12.880]  They come in lobby to shut down their competition, small farms and ranches. This is called vertical integration.
[22:12.880 --> 22:19.880]  And you heard me right when I said, use the light bulbs to spy on you.
[22:19.880 --> 22:27.880]  Ceiling lights in Minnesota send code and internet data associated press December 27th.
[22:27.880 --> 22:32.880]  And I covered this a little bit last week, but since then I wanted to check if my memory served.
[22:32.880 --> 22:40.880]  Because you'll hear me cover a news article and then I'll add some things on top of it from past research.
[22:40.880 --> 22:48.880]  And I was indeed correct. And when I first saw this going back about 13 years ago, I didn't believe it.
[22:48.880 --> 22:55.880]  Then 10 years ago when the National Ham Radio Association out of Dallas, we had their director on.
[22:55.880 --> 23:01.880]  They complained about it. We had them on. Then I had other engineers on and it's actually true.
[23:01.880 --> 23:08.880]  Yes, we're living in 2011 and it is Buck Rogers, but most of the Buck Rogers stuff is being used for bad.
[23:08.880 --> 23:14.880]  I love technology, but this is being used for bad. Ceiling lights in Minnesota send code to internet data.
[23:14.880 --> 23:20.880]  I see a story like that. I said I'd cover this later. I'll just cover the light bulb stuff now and then get to your calls.
[23:20.880 --> 23:23.880]  And then the economy and the TSA and a bunch of other information.
[23:23.880 --> 23:28.880]  North Korea warns war would bring nuclear Holocaust. That's coming up next hour.
[23:28.880 --> 23:33.880]  Machete, the race war, Mexican supremacist film has been denied.
[23:33.880 --> 23:39.880]  State of Texas tax incentives, which I actually don't like.
[23:39.880 --> 23:45.880]  Rodriguez got more publicity out of us attacking it than he loses with the 1.7 million tax incentive.
[23:45.880 --> 23:52.880]  He's lost, but I was against the tax incentive because they've been denying other films like films about Waco,
[23:52.880 --> 23:55.880]  because the state said that it was critical of the Texas government.
[23:55.880 --> 24:01.880]  Well, how can you deny that film funding in Texas and other films, but then not deny Rodriguez?
[24:01.880 --> 24:07.880]  I said change the law where they do get the tax incentives, but where government can't control what you say and do.
[24:07.880 --> 24:11.880]  I don't like the discrimination and that it's unfair.
[24:11.880 --> 24:14.880]  But I'm going to talk more about that coming up the next hour.
[24:14.880 --> 24:20.880]  And Rodriguez and Danny Trejo and others have been attacking yours truly, and I don't like it.
[24:20.880 --> 24:26.880]  And I'm going to stand up for myself here and go over that coming up in the next hour.
[24:26.880 --> 24:31.880]  I might spend a segment on it or so. I don't have a lot of time to cover that, but I mean, come on.
[24:31.880 --> 24:36.880]  My issue with those guys is they got caught lying about what was in the film.
[24:36.880 --> 24:41.880]  We got the script and they told the Austin American statesman that I didn't have the script.
[24:41.880 --> 24:47.880]  The producer of the film said that when we did have the script and the film came out and it was what we said was in it.
[24:47.880 --> 24:53.880]  I got the script from insiders there who were Hispanic and were upset about the film.
[24:53.880 --> 24:57.880]  I mean, this is a film creating just, well, I'm going to cover it later.
[24:57.880 --> 25:01.880]  The problem is I start getting into one issue and then I start segueing off into it.
[25:01.880 --> 25:06.880]  That's coming up in the next hour as well.
[25:06.880 --> 25:10.880]  State offices face letter campaign over machete incentives.
[25:10.880 --> 25:14.880]  And I love this one line out of the statesman where they do get it right.
[25:14.880 --> 25:19.880]  In early May, Jones expressed outrage over a trailer for the movie that Rodriguez released on the Internet.
[25:19.880 --> 25:24.880]  The trailer, which came out just after the passage of the New Immigration Law in Arizona, featured one of the stars,
[25:24.880 --> 25:29.880]  Danny Trejo, saying that he had a special Cinco de Mayo message to Arizona.
[25:29.880 --> 25:32.880]  He used a variety of weapons against Americans.
[25:32.880 --> 25:35.880]  You mean against white people with cowboy hats.
[25:35.880 --> 25:40.880]  And the message is, you know, you're wearing a cowboy hat, you're a racist, you deserve to die.
[25:40.880 --> 25:48.880]  I mean, in this movie, the whites are literally crucifying Hispanics, murdering pregnant Hispanic women, and they all deserve to die.
[25:48.880 --> 25:53.880]  Hitler put out movies about how groups like communists and others deserve to die.
[25:53.880 --> 25:56.880]  And so the Germans felt good about killing them.
[25:56.880 --> 26:04.880]  They stand here and watch Birth of the Nation quote Mexican style and just roll over in some political correctness.
[26:04.880 --> 26:05.880]  I'm done.
[26:05.880 --> 26:09.880]  I protested the Ku Klux Klan and I protested Robert Rodriguez.
[26:09.880 --> 26:14.880]  And I happened to know years ago, because I've been in a few movies here in Austin, really never asked,
[26:14.880 --> 26:21.880]  but was honored to be in some of them, Waking Life and Scanner Darkly and others, Rick Linkletter films,
[26:21.880 --> 26:27.880]  that got a chance to meet Keanu Reeves and Woody Harrelson and so many others are known a writer.
[26:27.880 --> 26:28.880]  The list goes on.
[26:28.880 --> 26:33.880]  But, you know, I've been told by directors and other people like, hey, you woke up Bruce Willis.
[26:33.880 --> 26:36.880]  We gave him your films and now he knows about the New World Order.
[26:36.880 --> 26:39.880]  And then sure enough, he tells Vanity Fair that, you know, six months later.
[26:39.880 --> 26:41.880]  But I hear other stuff.
[26:41.880 --> 26:49.880]  And going back years ago, I have people on sets, you know, other movie people go, yeah, I gave your films to Robert Rodriguez and he said,
[26:49.880 --> 26:53.880]  I don't want to see those because Alex is against the LaRica on Keesta.
[26:53.880 --> 26:55.880]  Alex is against open borders.
[26:55.880 --> 26:57.880]  Well, Mexico is completely imploding.
[26:57.880 --> 26:59.880]  There have been 28,000 deaths.
[26:59.880 --> 27:01.880]  It's a hell hole.
[27:01.880 --> 27:03.880]  And yes, it's lost wars with the U.S.
[27:03.880 --> 27:05.880]  And yes, Mexico is nationalistic.
[27:05.880 --> 27:07.880]  And yes, Mexico is angry.
[27:07.880 --> 27:11.880]  And it is a very popular thing in the culture now.
[27:11.880 --> 27:17.880]  And Hollywood pushes it because they want to break down this country to try to make Hispanic Americans hate this country.
[27:17.880 --> 27:19.880]  And the United States isn't perfect.
[27:19.880 --> 27:21.880]  Don't get me wrong.
[27:21.880 --> 27:27.880]  But I'll take the United States and the private property and the second amendment over what goes on in Mexico where you criticize the government.
[27:27.880 --> 27:31.880]  They come and shoot you in the street or you criticize corrupt drug lords.
[27:31.880 --> 27:33.880]  They come and kill you.
[27:33.880 --> 27:35.880]  It's a culture of intimidation and threats.
[27:35.880 --> 27:45.880]  And they put out a political trailer with real scenes from the movie showing state senators and cowboy hats in front of the Texas Capitol being shot by snipers because they're white.
[27:45.880 --> 27:51.880]  And then Danny Trejo says, I got a message to Arizona in the ad.
[27:51.880 --> 27:57.880]  And then Rodriguez comes out and says that stuff hidden in the movie when it was.
[27:57.880 --> 28:03.880]  And now Trejo told the Hollywood Reporter repeatedly, you know, maybe machete ought to come kill Texas.
[28:03.880 --> 28:07.880]  Maybe machete ought to come kill the Texas Film Commission.
[28:07.880 --> 28:12.880]  Are we going to turn into Mexico where you criticize somebody and somebody comes and kills you?
[28:12.880 --> 28:14.880]  Is that what this is all about?
[28:14.880 --> 28:15.880]  Huh?
[28:15.880 --> 28:17.880]  I mean, why don't you live in Mexico, Robert Rodriguez?
[28:17.880 --> 28:19.880]  Because you'd be shaken down.
[28:19.880 --> 28:22.880]  You'd be robbed by the drug cartels overnight.
[28:22.880 --> 28:26.880]  And you know that you're too scared to go down and live in Mexico.
[28:26.880 --> 28:29.880]  But you think it's a superior culture to this Republic.
[28:29.880 --> 28:33.880]  And you try to intimidate good Hispanic Americans to join your race cult.
[28:33.880 --> 28:36.880]  I know all about it.
[28:36.880 --> 28:37.880]  Okay.
[28:37.880 --> 28:40.880]  I don't like the white supremacists and I don't like the Mexican supremacists.
[28:40.880 --> 28:44.880]  The thing is the Mexican supremacists dance around out in the open and think that, you know,
[28:44.880 --> 28:52.880]  and all these cowardly, cowed gringos lick boots and bow down and get off on all of it.
[28:52.880 --> 28:53.880]  And not me.
[28:53.880 --> 28:54.880]  Not me.
[28:54.880 --> 28:55.880]  I'm calling you out.
[28:55.880 --> 28:56.880]  Okay.
[28:56.880 --> 28:57.880]  What you gonna do?
[28:57.880 --> 28:58.880]  Come after me, Trejo.
[28:58.880 --> 28:59.880]  I'm right here.
[28:59.880 --> 29:03.880]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.

[30:21.880 --> 30:24.880]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[30:24.880 --> 30:28.880]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[30:28.880 --> 30:31.880]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[30:31.880 --> 30:35.880]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[30:35.880 --> 30:40.880]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[30:40.880 --> 30:45.880]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors.

[32:53.880 --> 32:58.880]  H-O-M-E-G-A-I-N-150.com
[33:00.880 --> 33:04.880]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[33:04.880 --> 33:09.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[33:09.880 --> 33:14.880]  H-O-M-E-G-A-I-N-150.com
[33:20.880 --> 33:25.880]  I was a highwayman along the coach roads I did ride
[33:25.880 --> 33:33.880]  You see I live in the real world. I went to the gym today and heard all these grown men like a bunch of mother hens
[33:33.880 --> 33:40.880]  talking about sports icons and what great men they were and what great athletes they were.
[33:40.880 --> 33:47.880]  You can't blame them for being small children. They were raised up to only have icons that didn't matter
[33:47.880 --> 33:55.880]  and that's why they don't value liberty and freedom. They value being like little kids obsessing over other people.
[33:55.880 --> 34:04.880]  I live in the real world. I deal with real issues. I went on air two months before 9-11
[34:04.880 --> 34:09.880]  and said they're going to blow the world trade center up, call the wine house and tell them don't do it.
[34:09.880 --> 34:12.880]  They're going to blame it on their asset bin Laden.
[34:12.880 --> 34:18.880]  I get sent the secret federal documents where they admit homeland security set up for gun owners, conservatives,
[34:18.880 --> 34:24.880]  returning veterans and that the government that's illegitimate is preparing for war with the American people
[34:24.880 --> 34:29.880]  after they steal everybody's pension funds and bank accounts and devalue the dollar.
[34:29.880 --> 34:42.880]  That's what matters. I've gone up against the TSA and put it on the front burner nationwide as a revolt.
[34:42.880 --> 34:50.880]  And so you better believe when I get contacted by members of a film crew who are Hispanic and who are smart
[34:50.880 --> 34:55.880]  and who understand what a racist film that is full of stereotypes on both sides
[34:55.880 --> 35:00.880]  that it was going to generate enmity and division. You better believe I covered it.
[35:00.880 --> 35:07.880]  And then to see Rodriguez and others go in the press and say nothing that was in that trailer was in the film
[35:07.880 --> 35:14.880]  and then I had the script and knew he was lying and then to see them in the newspaper saying that I didn't have the script
[35:14.880 --> 35:20.880]  and then to go to the movie theater and it was the script word for word. That's outrageous.
[35:20.880 --> 35:26.880]  I mean, if you're going to make a birth of the nation, that was the famous Ku Klux Klan, pro-Ku Klux Klan film,
[35:26.880 --> 35:31.880]  if you're going to make one of those from a Hispanic perspective, if you're going to be a Hispanic supremacist,
[35:31.880 --> 35:33.880]  then be proud about it.
[35:33.880 --> 35:39.880]  Like the Brown Berets I can play clips of right here saying whites are the devil and whites need to all be killed
[35:39.880 --> 35:45.880]  or Reverend Wright up there saying whites are the devil or Black Panthers I've played here saying kill all the white women,
[35:45.880 --> 35:51.880]  kill all the white children. I mean, if you're going to get into that type of garbage, then go all the way.
[35:51.880 --> 35:56.880]  Don't sneak around and say it's comedy or it's satire when everybody knows it isn't.
[35:56.880 --> 36:03.880]  I know what your political beliefs are. I live here in this town.
[36:03.880 --> 36:09.880]  Don't sit there and say that you're in fantasy world when you're not in fantasy world,
[36:09.880 --> 36:15.880]  when you're in the real world in a real arena against real adversaries.
[36:15.880 --> 36:21.880]  I read the SPP North American Union documents, how they're going to use racial division to bring in the world government,
[36:21.880 --> 36:26.880]  how they're going to use the flu, how they're going to use the border implosion to do it.
[36:26.880 --> 36:31.880]  I want freedom for Mexico. I want freedom for my country. I want to live in peace with everybody.
[36:31.880 --> 36:38.880]  But I know the Ford Foundation and the big social engineers, and this came out in several congressional commissions
[36:38.880 --> 36:44.880]  back in the 1940s, 50s, 60s and 70s, the church committees and others, that the Carnegie Endowment and others
[36:44.880 --> 36:50.880]  said they would create racial division in this country in the name of diversity to get everybody at each other's throats
[36:50.880 --> 36:57.880]  through divide and conquer so we don't come together against the New World Order.
[36:57.880 --> 37:01.880]  By 2045, more than half this country is going to be Hispanic.
[37:01.880 --> 37:08.880]  And if the globalists can teach Hispanics to be anti-America and to hate this Republic, they're going to be able to win.
[37:08.880 --> 37:15.880]  But if we, the people, no matter what color you are, can wake up everybody, including Hispanics,
[37:15.880 --> 37:19.880]  of the global crime syndicate, we can have a free society together.
[37:19.880 --> 37:25.880]  We can all own guns and own property and have low taxes and control our own destiny.
[37:25.880 --> 37:32.880]  But you look at Hollywood, all they do is push destructive stuff to the culture, to the family.
[37:32.880 --> 37:38.880]  Everything they sell is death. You're never going to hear a liberal black leader talk about how,
[37:38.880 --> 37:44.880]  and I was corrected, I've been saying 51% of blacks have been aborted since Roe v. Wade 1973.
[37:44.880 --> 37:52.880]  I'm sorry, it was 52%. 52% of black people are not born in this country.
[37:52.880 --> 37:58.880]  They're murdered in the womb. That number is climbing to upwards of 30% of Hispanics.
[37:58.880 --> 38:01.880]  The globalists are upset. They're only killing about 18% of whites.
[38:01.880 --> 38:07.880]  Now, all these fake white leaders, black leaders, Hispanic leaders on the left and the right,
[38:07.880 --> 38:12.880]  they'll never talk about issues like that. I don't want Hispanic babies dead.
[38:12.880 --> 38:17.880]  I want them to have freedom in 1776 beating in their heart.
[38:17.880 --> 38:24.880]  Not a bunch of Ford Foundation racial division trash that Robert Rodriguez is putting out.
[38:24.880 --> 38:28.880]  Now, he's got his first amendment to put movies like that out.
[38:28.880 --> 38:32.880]  And I said that, and I told the Fort Worth Star Telegram and the Austin,
[38:32.880 --> 38:36.880]  American Statesmen and Fox News and all of them when they called to quote me,
[38:36.880 --> 38:44.880]  that I'm saying that they've denied funding to mildly political films in Texas and the state of Texas,
[38:44.880 --> 38:48.880]  because if it's going to have tax incentives, which I'm all for, I'm always for lower taxes,
[38:48.880 --> 38:51.880]  then it should be no strings attached.
[38:51.880 --> 38:55.880]  I've never tried to go get the tax incentives because I looked at the way it's set up.
[38:55.880 --> 39:00.880]  You got to go to this little board and they decide and I would never get them.
[39:00.880 --> 39:06.880]  But Rodriguez could put out one of the most radical hate-filled, race-baiting films I've ever seen,
[39:06.880 --> 39:09.880]  and he was going to get the funding. It was approved. We called the governor's office.
[39:09.880 --> 39:11.880]  Then they lied and said it hadn't been approved.
[39:11.880 --> 39:15.880]  Now it came out in the statesmen through FOIA requests that they'd been told they were getting funding.
[39:15.880 --> 39:20.880]  That's why Danny Trejo, the star of the film, is now in the news.
[39:20.880 --> 39:27.880]  He is now in the Austin, America Statesmen. He is now in the Hollywood Reporter.
[39:27.880 --> 39:33.880]  Here's the headline, Machetes Danny Trejo, Knox, Texas Film Commission, Funding Decision.
[39:33.880 --> 39:36.880]  He says, it's going back on your word and that's not Texan.
[39:36.880 --> 39:42.880]  Well, in your movie, Texans are all racist devils that have to be mass-murdered in a helter-skelter Charlie Manson race war.
[39:42.880 --> 39:47.880]  Trejo, the bad guys talk about how their great-great-granddaddy was at the Alamo.
[39:47.880 --> 39:53.880]  So don't act like you got some respect for Texas. You don't have any respect for those men at the Alamo,
[39:53.880 --> 39:58.880]  a third of them that were Hispanic. You don't even know about the Alamo, Mr. Trejo.
[39:58.880 --> 40:03.880]  So shut up! It's going back on your word and that's not Texan.
[40:03.880 --> 40:10.880]  Trejo tells the Hollywood Reporter, I'm kind of hurt. You're kind of hurt that we called you on your race war film.
[40:10.880 --> 40:17.880]  We're in the script. They have you worship as God at the end, the only part of it that was cut out.
[40:17.880 --> 40:24.880]  Rather than the film being negative to Texas, Trejo feels strongly the funding reversal goes against the Texas way of life.
[40:24.880 --> 40:28.880]  I think the way the Texas Film Commission did this puts Texas in the bad lights, says Trejo.
[40:28.880 --> 40:34.880]  All the folks at the Alamo would be pretty mad right now. Really? They'd be pretty mad right now.
[40:34.880 --> 40:39.880]  Yeah, I bet they would when your film attacks the people at the Alamo. It's a bunch of racist scum.
[40:39.880 --> 40:44.880]  It might be Machete kills the Texas Film Commission.
[40:44.880 --> 40:49.880]  And I've got him in other newspapers talking about coming to Texas as Machete.
[40:49.880 --> 40:56.880]  By the way, the Film Commission is a puppet of Rick Perry. The Film Commission had had to resign a few months ago.
[40:56.880 --> 41:03.880]  Actually, December 1st, he had to resign a month ago.
[41:03.880 --> 41:08.880]  Rick Perry's getting ready to run for president. You think he's going to have his name attached to this?
[41:08.880 --> 41:14.880]  By the way, I don't think Rick Perry has any business involved with your film.
[41:14.880 --> 41:19.880]  But I simply told the statesman, and I told the Film Commission, and it was printed all over the country,
[41:19.880 --> 41:23.880]  I listed the films that they've cut funding for. They didn't get their tax incentives.
[41:23.880 --> 41:28.880]  A film about Waco and others. And I said, if you take their incentives and not this incentive,
[41:28.880 --> 41:33.880]  you can never take anybody else's incentive. And I said, that's fine with me,
[41:33.880 --> 41:39.880]  because I don't want you to have the moral authority to be able to waddle in there and censor people.
[41:39.880 --> 41:46.880]  I'm all for tax cuts. By the way, I say in the next legislative session that they reverse that law
[41:46.880 --> 41:53.880]  and give the 1.7 million to Robert Rodriguez. Maybe he can move down to war-torn Mexico,
[41:53.880 --> 41:57.880]  where the criminal elite down there rule over their people.
[41:57.880 --> 42:03.880]  Hey, Trejo and Rodriguez, why don't you make a movie about the racism in Mexico
[42:03.880 --> 42:10.880]  and how if you watch the Mexican Congress on C-SPAN when they have it on sometimes,
[42:10.880 --> 42:18.880]  they look wider than people in Alabama. They look wider than a Ku Klux Klan rally.
[42:18.880 --> 42:25.880]  I was recently on vacation, and where I was on vacation was about half the people there were rich Mexicans,
[42:25.880 --> 42:34.880]  and I thought I was looking at 6'5 people from the Netherlands or something, or Scandinavians.
[42:34.880 --> 42:44.880]  You know, I don't call you cockroaches like the rich Mexicans that got their foot on your neck, dude.
[42:44.880 --> 42:49.880]  I'm not like Margaret Sanger, the fake liberal, saying we got to hire black leaders so we can kill these weeds.
[42:49.880 --> 42:53.880]  Now, I'm not here trying to have division. I want to be friends with everybody,
[42:53.880 --> 42:59.880]  but I'm not going to sit here and watch your trashy film implying all whites are racist and take it.
[42:59.880 --> 43:09.880]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. You've heard me talk about the delicious, easy to fix and very storable foods from eFoodsDirect.com.

[43:59.880 --> 44:03.880]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot Movement.
[44:03.880 --> 44:07.880]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[44:07.880 --> 44:13.880]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[44:13.880 --> 44:18.880]  We're looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[44:18.880 --> 44:27.880]  Not worried about them moving south, closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[44:27.880 --> 44:33.880]  I'm looking for America.
[44:33.880 --> 44:39.880]  Where American and be proud, go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[44:39.880 --> 44:48.880]  I landed a free in my home of the brave. Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[44:48.880 --> 44:51.880]  Long gone.
[44:51.880 --> 44:54.880]  But I know in my heart it's still the same.
[44:54.880 --> 44:59.880]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America today.
[44:59.880 --> 45:04.880]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[45:04.880 --> 45:09.880]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[45:09.880 --> 45:14.880]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[45:14.880 --> 45:20.880]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[45:20.880 --> 45:24.880]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[45:24.880 --> 45:28.880]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[45:28.880 --> 45:35.880]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[45:35.880 --> 45:40.880]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[45:40.880 --> 45:45.880]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[45:45.880 --> 45:51.880]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.
[45:51.880 --> 45:59.880]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[45:59.880 --> 46:07.880]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions.
[46:07.880 --> 46:15.880]  Yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[46:15.880 --> 46:20.880]  My name is Mario Sifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[46:20.880 --> 46:25.880]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions,
[46:25.880 --> 46:33.880]  it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[46:33.880 --> 46:41.880]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[46:41.880 --> 46:51.880]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[46:51.880 --> 47:12.880]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have. That's www.silverlungs.com.
[47:21.880 --> 47:31.880]  The Silver Lungs System is designed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[47:31.880 --> 47:41.880]  The Silver Lungs System comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[47:41.880 --> 48:01.880]  The Silver Lungs System comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[48:01.880 --> 48:04.480]  But that's what I'm frustrated about.
[48:04.480 --> 48:08.280]  I have all the government documents, and we have scientists on air that they're putting
[48:08.280 --> 48:13.960]  hundreds of toxic poisons in the water to reduce fertility and to brain damage people,
[48:13.960 --> 48:18.520]  and I'm busy having to deal with race war movies.
[48:18.520 --> 48:23.920]  I know that the so-called liberals, not on the street, they're well-meaning, but at
[48:23.920 --> 48:28.640]  the highest levels, the Ford Foundation, people like Margaret Singer, the Rockefellers, said
[48:28.640 --> 48:33.560]  they would pose as liberals, would stir up racial division so they get people's trust
[48:33.560 --> 48:38.400]  as the ones stirring it up, show when you're busy hating the white guy or the Mexican or
[48:38.400 --> 48:42.080]  whoever that lives down the street or the guy from China or the guy from Germany or
[48:42.080 --> 48:46.720]  whatever, or the Brit or whoever, while you're busy hating somebody because of their religion
[48:46.720 --> 48:51.080]  or their color or whatever, the big government's the referee over it all, and they're a bunch
[48:51.080 --> 48:54.080]  of eugenicists that want you dead.
[48:54.080 --> 48:58.080]  Why didn't Robert Rodriguez make a movie about, hey, Hispanics, don't go out and abort all
[48:58.080 --> 49:05.000]  your babies, I don't want you to die, I want you to live, I love you, I don't dislike
[49:05.000 --> 49:09.680]  you because of what color your skin is, I don't like it that you're being filled full
[49:09.680 --> 49:15.360]  of racism for me, and I'm supposed to sit here and take it, I'm 36 years old, I hadn't
[49:15.360 --> 49:19.840]  done jack squat to anybody.
[49:19.840 --> 49:24.600]  The only racism I've ever experienced in my life is from people that aren't white coming
[49:24.600 --> 49:30.360]  after me because I'm white, and do I sit there and then hate everybody who's a different
[49:30.360 --> 49:35.440]  color than me because certain groups, certain people in those groups have attacked me, no,
[49:35.440 --> 49:39.600]  but I'm not gonna lay down here with a bunch of self-righteous people lecturing me about
[49:39.600 --> 49:46.160]  how I'm bad, see, it's all a political intimidation, just to make everybody guilty, guilty for
[49:46.160 --> 49:51.400]  the earth, pay more taxes, has nothing to do with saving the earth, oh, guilty about
[49:51.400 --> 49:54.920]  race, oh, you're not for the health care, you don't like black people, remember that
[49:54.920 --> 50:00.960]  was the talking point on CNN and MSNBC, what does that have to do with it?
[50:00.960 --> 50:07.680]  Just non sequitur in the middle of nowhere, whether it was Carlos Watson or the hardball
[50:07.680 --> 50:12.880]  guy or the other host on CNN, all of them, this is really racism, that's why they don't
[50:12.880 --> 50:16.560]  want the government health care, really, we read the subsections about death panels,
[50:16.560 --> 50:20.240]  now it's admitted that they are in there and that they are gonna cut people's care who
[50:20.240 --> 50:26.200]  are older, they're like, be quiet racist, racist, you throw that out there because you're
[50:26.200 --> 50:31.000]  worse than just a run of the mill racist, you're a raced baiter, you're a master racist who
[50:31.000 --> 50:36.480]  uses it and that's why I'm frustrated and I don't like being talked to like an idiot
[50:36.480 --> 50:42.280]  by Rodriguez and people saying you don't have the script, you know none of what's in the
[50:42.280 --> 50:48.240]  trailers in the movie and it was a lie, I'm tired of government, I'm tired of media treating
[50:48.240 --> 50:53.920]  me like I'm stupid, I'm not stupid and the American people aren't stupid and they're
[50:53.920 --> 50:54.920]  waking up.
[50:54.920 --> 50:58.280]  Alright, I said I'd take a lot of calls here in the new year and I promise when we come
[50:58.280 --> 51:02.920]  back next hour, I'm taking nothing but calls, I won't even get to all this news then.
[51:02.920 --> 51:11.000]  Paul, Peter, Jason, Jarrah, Nick, Manny, Laura, Bob, Andrew, Tim, Henry, Garfield, we could
[51:11.000 --> 51:18.000]  take unlimited calls, the phone system would take 500 calls at once, oh, help me, 88821,
[51:18.000 --> 51:22.960]  22244, I appreciate you holding, I just want to live in peace and they make these race
[51:22.960 --> 51:27.080]  war films so if you're Hispanic, you don't feel comfortable around whites.
[51:27.080 --> 51:30.720]  So if you're white, you don't feel comfortable around Hispanics and everybody's got a chip
[51:30.720 --> 51:32.120]  on their shoulder.
[51:32.120 --> 51:36.760]  Meanwhile, we're all fighting with each other, I mean have you seen how the blacks and Hispanics
[51:36.760 --> 51:38.920]  are killing each other, it's even worse.
[51:38.920 --> 51:44.120]  See the media convinces people that racism only comes from white people, it isn't what
[51:44.120 --> 51:50.120]  you call racism, it's tribalism, you ever seen the Star Trek episode where you know
[51:50.120 --> 51:54.320]  the overlords are white on one side of their face and black on the other and on the other
[51:54.320 --> 51:57.960]  it's the opposite, they're genetically identical except for that but one group's suppressed
[51:57.960 --> 52:03.320]  and the others aren't, there's always groups that will use division to get control.
[52:03.320 --> 52:09.440]  I'm fighting with the big international mega banks, I want my free market, I want my private
[52:09.440 --> 52:13.680]  property, I want my self dignity, I want my second amendment.
[52:13.680 --> 52:20.440]  So I don't have to live in fear, it's a mark of a free man that I got a 357 magnum right
[52:20.440 --> 52:29.120]  here, it's a mark of a free man that I got semi-auto 7mm magnum rifles, it's a mark of
[52:29.120 --> 52:36.680]  a free man that if I want to bear it, semi-autic 50 cal, I got one, it's mine, I'm free, I'm
[52:36.680 --> 52:43.640]  not domesticated, I didn't have my wavos hacked off, it's not even that I have courage,
[52:43.640 --> 52:50.040]  it's when people get in my face, I get right back at it and I'm not running anymore, I'm
[52:50.040 --> 52:59.960]  not backing down anymore, I got the TSA here sticking their hands down people's pants.
[52:59.960 --> 53:04.000]  Now they're confiscating it, photocop people's credit cards, listen though I mentioned this
[53:04.000 --> 53:07.800]  light bulb business, if they can ban whatever toilets they want globally, if they can ban
[53:07.800 --> 53:12.720]  tobacco wherever they want globally, first where you can smoke it later totally ban it,
[53:12.720 --> 53:18.360]  if they can have federal inspections of your house, that's on the books now, pass the house
[53:18.360 --> 53:23.160]  and repass the senate, if they can ban your light bulb, if they can put sodium fluoride
[53:23.160 --> 53:26.360]  in your water and now the media announces the government wants to put lithium in from
[53:26.360 --> 53:31.720]  Japan to the United States, both nations have announced it, all that's happening, they set
[53:31.720 --> 53:37.600]  the precedent with things that sound reasonable, oh you've got to put this certain type of mercury
[53:37.600 --> 53:43.040]  filled light bulb in, that major studies show gives you a horrible headache and all of these
[53:43.040 --> 53:48.480]  incandescent studies show are soothing to the eye and more of a natural light, you're
[53:48.480 --> 53:53.720]  not allowed to have those and in Europe they're actually raiding people's houses that have
[53:53.720 --> 53:58.160]  them now, when you see an Audi commercial about the green police arresting people, that's
[53:58.160 --> 54:02.440]  what they're really getting you ready for, they're now digging through people's trashcans
[54:02.440 --> 54:06.560]  all over the US and cities that have put it in taking you to jail if you don't recycle
[54:06.560 --> 54:12.120]  properly, they're arresting 81 year old women for things like that, it's happening, it's
[54:12.120 --> 54:18.200]  tyranny, it has nothing to do with the environment, it's their excuse to take over society, oh
[54:18.200 --> 54:24.760]  Chris Matthews say to that, oh you're a racist, I think I like a blue car, not a green car,
[54:24.760 --> 54:30.960]  oh you're a racist, see any opinion the political correct people bring out race, when it has
[54:30.960 --> 54:36.760]  nothing to do with it, it's a distraction, it's a political football and meanwhile they
[54:36.760 --> 54:43.240]  couldn't get the Congress to pass the greenhouse gas takeover, let me explain to you but I'm
[54:43.240 --> 54:47.920]  all against pollution, I live here, I don't want to die, my family lives here, your family
[54:47.920 --> 54:51.800]  lives here, I've studied the power plants, Texas supplies more power to any other state
[54:51.800 --> 54:56.560]  in the union to surrounding states, number one power producer in the country, Texas this
[54:56.560 --> 55:00.880]  year said you haven't passed that legislation, if you pass it in the Congress we'll follow
[55:00.880 --> 55:04.800]  it even though it's a violation of states rights, that's what the Attorney General said,
[55:04.800 --> 55:09.800]  they couldn't pass the law, Obama announced last week they're going to have the EPA come
[55:09.800 --> 55:17.520]  in, China has no restrictions on their reactors, on their coal powered plants, here they have
[55:17.520 --> 55:22.720]  digital sniffers up on the top and sestas that fly above every day, to test the air,
[55:22.720 --> 55:27.560]  there is literally no pollution coming out of those coal powered plants when they're
[55:27.560 --> 55:33.040]  operating under specs, except for carbon dioxide and water vapor, so they've listed that as
[55:33.040 --> 55:38.400]  a toxic waste when it's what plants breathe and every study shows that it's been much
[55:38.400 --> 55:43.440]  higher in Earth's earlier history and that it's good for humans, good for plants because
[55:43.440 --> 55:53.120]  plants then exhale more oxygen that we need, the Earth is carbon dioxide, oxygen starved
[55:53.120 --> 55:59.800]  and now there's no law backing up the EPA, they just come into Texas and seize control
[55:59.800 --> 56:04.800]  of plants and they're going to raise the standards and shut down many coal powered plants, China
[56:04.800 --> 56:09.240]  gets to build two to three a week, we don't even get two or three new coal powered plants
[56:09.240 --> 56:14.080]  a year in the entire United States, we can't compete and that's globalism, shut down our
[56:14.080 --> 56:19.760]  nation by any way they can, they tell you what type of light bulbs you can have, what
[56:19.760 --> 56:25.680]  type of toilet you think any of that's going on in China or India or Mexico, zero, zero,
[56:25.680 --> 56:30.360]  it's meant to deindustrialize this country and it's a huge out of control federal power
[56:30.360 --> 56:34.480]  grab, the environmental protection agency announced Thursday it is taking the unprecedented
[56:34.480 --> 56:40.040]  step of directly issuing air permits to industries in Texas citing the state's unwillingness
[56:40.040 --> 56:44.680]  to comply with greenhouse gas regulations going into effect January 2nd, you know when
[56:44.680 --> 56:48.680]  the TSA start sticking their hands down people's pants, people say show us the law and they
[56:48.680 --> 56:53.560]  say we don't have a law, it's a policy, a sworn peace officer can't do that but these
[56:53.560 --> 56:59.480]  goons do, these federal goons outside of their jurisdiction, it's the same thing here, they
[56:59.480 --> 57:05.240]  didn't pass the law, there's no congressional law, at least Congress in 2007 passed the
[57:05.240 --> 57:12.560]  law to phase in banning the incandescent light bulbs, there's no law here, these are lawless
[57:12.560 --> 57:17.960]  people, it's illegitimate and Texas needs to stand up against these globalists in their
[57:17.960 --> 57:24.120]  own statements at the UN saying they want to shut down our industrial capacity because
[57:24.120 --> 57:27.840]  then only certain key insiders will be able to operate, they'll move everything that's
[57:27.840 --> 57:33.320]  left to China, this is the mega rich waging war against all the rest of us, they don't
[57:33.320 --> 57:37.920]  want a free market just like the legislation they're trying to pass to shut down the family
[57:37.920 --> 57:43.440]  farms and ranches that was publicly written by big agribusiness to shut down their competition,
[57:43.440 --> 57:50.800]  it's the real fight, second hour straight ahead info wars dot com, stay with us.

[58:50.520 --> 58:56.000]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important
[58:56.000 --> 59:01.280]  day in America in more than 50 years, he says it will change everything about our lives,
[59:01.280 --> 59:05.120]  the way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children and even how you take care of
[59:05.120 --> 59:06.720]  your health and your own family.
[59:06.720 --> 59:11.640]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years, the crazy part is he's usually
[59:11.640 --> 59:15.960]  right, you see he predicted the collapse of GM, Panny May, Freddie Mac and America's
[59:15.960 --> 59:21.680]  biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties, in fact Barron's called his work a dire prophecy,
[59:21.680 --> 59:25.720]  recently he created a video which you can watch online for free detailing his biggest
[59:25.720 --> 59:30.400]  and most important prediction yet and it's a real eye opener, I can't stress this enough,
[59:30.400 --> 59:34.120]  you should at least watch this free video online today, he explains everything you need
[59:34.120 --> 59:38.080]  to know including simple steps you can take to protect yourself, you can find the video
[59:38.080 --> 59:45.440]  at www.endofamerica3.com, that's end of America, the number three dot com, watch the free video

[01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:17.040]  Okay, the entirety of the second hour is dedicated to your phone calls, all in Ohio, thanks for
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:23.920]  holding during my ranting, sorry I got diverted off into the issues of the balkanization,
[01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:24.920]  go ahead.
[01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:31.600]  Yeah, Alex, new year greetings to you and your family and the staff, I'm sorry I left
[01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:38.000]  out the word happy because I don't think 2011 is exactly going to be happy, Alex I've been
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:43.400]  awake for 15 years and I'm learning more every day thanks to you and your broadcast, I listen
[01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:51.360]  to you every day, there were three things that I consider as top issues, number one
[01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:57.120]  on the list was your expose of the TSA and the body scanners, I mean this thing went
[01:00:57.120 --> 01:01:02.120]  viral all over the nation and Alex I want to tell you I'm an elected official here in
[01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:11.800]  Ohio and one of my resolutions is to work with our sheriff to keep these things out of our
[01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:17.000]  buildings and off our streets, I mean the sheriff is a top law enforcement officer in
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:22.320]  our county and he's got the right and the power to do that and doubling my efforts to
[01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:28.080]  work with our state legislatures to help them learn about the 10th amendment because obviously
[01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:29.560]  they don't know what it is.
[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:33.960]  Well that is the good news, that is the good news, I mean as you know but others may not,
[01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:39.400]  New Jersey, Colorado, I mean all over legislatures are moving, the congressional legislature,
[01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:45.320]  the federal legislature is moving, the congress, towns are moving, the Austin board passed a
[01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:50.360]  resolution against it, I mean the TSA is losing on this and if they lose on this they lose
[01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:56.200]  on everything because this is the federal takeover force, it's now admitted.
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:02:04.480]  And you know the EPA dictates that our state has to put up with, they don't have the legal
[01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:12.440]  backing to do this, they're pushing a stormwater runoff fee on our people, two in a three billion
[01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:19.040]  dollars a year that just came through and you know you talk about the smart grid technology,
[01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:25.520]  you know if our legislatures can't take care of it there are ways that we take care of
[01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:26.520]  it.
[01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:32.320]  I'm using isolation transformers to block the signals, I'm using neomium magnets to
[01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:39.680]  stop, to erase the RFID tags and banning gardens and small farms, I'm telling the people to
[01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:44.320]  put gardens in their yards, good, do the American thing.
[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:47.920]  Absolutely God bless you, great first call of the new year, Paul hit the nail on the
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:53.000]  head on so many fronts and folks if you think we're joking, read the Food Safety Act, we've
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:57.480]  read it on air many times but it's got the subsections where it allows the feds to do
[01:02:57.480 --> 01:03:02.600]  anything they want and put any amount of regulation on small farms and ranches, it says you'll
[01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:08.280]  have to pay fees and inspections to literally can peaches and feed them to your children.
[01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:11.760]  I mean it's just any preparation of food, you can forget it.
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:14.360]  Peter in Washington, welcome to the airwaves.
[01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:19.000]  Hello Alex, I've called with you before, basically can you hear me?
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.000]  Yes sir.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:28.400]  Okay, basically what I want to do is I have an article from the December 17th issue of
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:34.160]  Forward Magazine, I'm not going to read it of course, but your forward newspaper, but
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:36.040]  your people should look it up.
[01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:46.320]  The headline is it's on media czar Julius Genakowski and the title is A Talmud Ace,
[01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:49.400]  Tackles Thorny Issue of Net Neutrality.
[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:54.960]  Now what that tells me is they're going to shift the meaning of neutrality.
[01:03:54.960 --> 01:04:03.040]  No, no, this is the horrible news, I've read the quote ruling, they call it an order of
[01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:11.160]  the FCC and even Fox News got it right when they analyzed it, they say oh, A we've got
[01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:16.120]  regulatory authority over the internet, something the FCC has never had, they're just power
[01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:19.960]  grabbing it and then they say we're going to protect net neutrality, but the fine print
[01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:26.240]  says they will allow companies to block or restrict or allow them to give more preferential
[01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:28.720]  treatment to certain sites.
[01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:33.840]  So that's the end of the internet as we know it right there, the actual end of net neutrality,
[01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:37.540]  very bizarre, appreciate your call, more calls straight ahead, I want to move quick from
[01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:46.960]  888-201-2244, I'm glad he brought up the FCC, that's something big that happened in
[01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:49.880]  2010, it's now 2011, hard to believe, thank you for joining us on the first live transmission
[01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:53.760]  of the year, we're going to come back and take five or six more calls in the next segment,
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:58.280]  then five or six more after that, then five or six more after that, stay with us.
[01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:06.640]  Hi, this is Alex Jones, you've heard me talk about the delicious, easy to fix and very

[01:05:48.840 --> 01:06:01.080]  forward slash Alex, that's 800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:12.560]  What we've got here is failure to mutate, some men you just can't reach, so you get
[01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:27.560]  what we had here last week, which is the way he wants it, well he is, I don't like it
[01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:28.560]  anymore.
[01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:35.960]  On corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:43.120]  One big thing that happened in 2010 was the FCC did do the unthinkable, they declared regulatory
[01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:53.000]  jurisdiction over the internet, not just over broadband internet transmissions, but even
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:58.280]  Forbes, the Associated Press and many others, in fact what's that publication you guys have
[01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:05.280]  got on screen, the headline is the FCC's threat to internet freedom, I mean that's the Wall
[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:10.400]  Street Journal, the FCC's threat to internet freedom, net neutrality sounds nice but the
[01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:16.080]  web is working fine now, the new rules will inhibit investment, deter innovation and create
[01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:23.240]  a serious problem and a billable hour bonanza for lawyers, well it's more than that, I've
[01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:25.920]  read the quote FCC ruling.
[01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:31.080]  First off, the FCC has no jurisdiction over the internet, never has, now they just say
[01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:37.600]  they do, it's kind of like the TSA, first take your shoes off, your belt off, answer
[01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:41.680]  questions, go through a naked body scanner, now we're going to pat you down, even if you
[01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:45.000]  go ahead and go through the scanner, now we're going to go in your waistband, now we're
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:49.200]  going to go all the way in your pants, now we want a tissue swab, oh that's now being
[01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:56.840]  announced, now we want to copy all your credit cards, we have that on video at prisonplanet.com
[01:07:56.840 --> 01:08:04.040]  and infowars.com, big sys, photocopies, credit cards, confiscates, Christmas calendars, oh
[01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:11.920]  it's all confirmed and the FBI can't do that, the FCC can't do that, the local police can't
[01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:17.800]  do that, how can they, they just created a new quasi-jurisdiction and are doing it outside
[01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:25.640]  of law, they're crazy, it's a power grab, how did Hitler do what he did, nobody stopped
[01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:33.360]  him, so that happened this year and the media spun it that oh they're going to protect net
[01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:39.240]  neutrality, they say we'll protect it by allowing companies to give preferential treatment to
[01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:44.480]  certain websites, how fast they can be visited, that's the end of net neutrality, this is
[01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:51.720]  very dangerous, oh man I tell you, and now they're talking about trying to regulate satellite
[01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:58.520]  radio, you know we're terrestrial, we're both satellite and AMFM internet, but you know
[01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:03.320]  so we're under terrestrial rules, which is fine because I don't, I'm not a big potty
[01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:10.520]  mouth, alright side issue, let's just get to your phone calls as promised, Jason in
[01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:19.800]  New Jersey, Jason you're on the air, good sir, what's on your mind, well TSA over the
[01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:26.760]  past year, they pulled out all the stops, I used to work for TSA, my best friend works
[01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:32.840]  for TSA now, and that thermos issue, I don't know if you've heard about the quote unquote
[01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:38.280]  the thermos, they're taking precautions and everything else, they're always making something
[01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:43.240]  new that's bad to train everyone that they're guilty and evil, the average compartmentalized
[01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:47.040]  TSA worker doesn't know that, they're just brainwashed that are actually trying to fight
[01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:51.520]  terrorists, but yes now they're confiscating thermoses because they think bombs could be
[01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:56.920]  put inside the thermos area, and then a pilot a few weeks ago shot video that the regular
[01:09:56.920 --> 01:10:02.320]  airport workers can drive right through, wave a card, wave a card, inside go right in, but
[01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:07.520]  pilots who were trusted with the aircraft are having their genitals grabbed, and so homeland
[01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:12.920]  security raided the pilot and told him we don't like your YouTube video, you made us
[01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:18.640]  look bad, so there's such thugs now that they raided the guy to make it look like he was
[01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:23.920]  a criminal, but all it did was blow up in their face, they're power mad.
[01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:30.880]  Yeah when I worked there there was an issue because I'm a former Marine, so when I got
[01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:36.360]  involved in TSA about five years after it had started, so when I worked there I would
[01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:42.520]  always, the first thing I did, once I started working I realized it was total BS, and I
[01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:47.560]  would always look around and point out security flaws, that got me in trouble several times
[01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:48.640]  and they didn't pretend to be all-
[01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:52.720]  Yeah because they don't, in fact I've seen that in the news, in fact they just had a
[01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:57.040]  former TSA boss blow the whistle, he was the boss over a whole airport, it was all over
[01:10:57.040 --> 01:11:02.240]  the news last week, we covered it here, because he pointed out all the security problems and
[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:07.200]  they just fired him, but also now they're calling in TSA and saying, do you have a problem
[01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:10.600]  with putting your hands down people's pants, do you have a problem with the radiation from
[01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:14.960]  these scanners, and if you say yes they give you a pink slip, so they're building an army
[01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:19.720]  of idiots, anybody who's smart they're running off.
[01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:23.720]  I want people to know the kind of people that they have worked in there, for instance my
[01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:31.200]  best friend's girlfriend is stupid, she's not smart at all, okay, she has a low level
[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:35.640]  high school education, they hire people at the ghetto who don't have any kind of brains,
[01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:41.320]  and now she's a supervisor, simply because she wears tight pants to work, and I know
[01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:47.440]  for a fact the questions that they ask, they may ask these questions for no reason whatsoever
[01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:53.480]  because the question they ask on these exams and the tests and the interviews for promotions,
[01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:58.160]  this girl couldn't have possibly answered those questions, so you have for instance
[01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:05.320]  my best friend who's a former Marine also, who took the same test, and he did her test
[01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:11.080]  for her, but she gets a supervisor position and he does it.
[01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:17.880]  Well what they're doing is they're hiring the gunish type people who will just get off
[01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:22.800]  on the petty power and follow orders, I appreciate your call, scary call, Garra in California
[01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:28.800]  thanks for holding her on the air worldwide.
[01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:35.640]  Hi there, I'm Garra, I'm a creative consultant, I'm a hardcore pro-life humanitarian warrior
[01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:36.640]  princess.
[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:44.240]  Well, Garra, it's good to have a warrior princess on with us, that's right, at your service,
[01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:52.360]  sir, I'm at the service of God, I'm at the service of my country, and of men, why, why,
[01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:53.360]  why?
[01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:57.520]  All right, awesome, what's on your mind in 2011, good to have you here with us?
[01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:04.480]  Alex, you are so hot, and it's great to be online with you.
[01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:08.960]  You mean hot politically, well the radio show is hot because it's real, what's on your
[01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:11.160]  mind, what do you think was important in 2010?
[01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:19.560]  Oh, so really much, but you know, the most is that we've got a chance for humanity that
[01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:25.400]  in the eyes of millions, you know, is a hero, and what makes a hero is that it's someone
[01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:33.520]  that can, is able to make us all realize and articulate and decipher the deceit and the,
[01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:42.960]  and of these, these self-exposing, self-admitting, sadist psychopaths, whether they're politicians
[01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:50.600]  or they're the media, they are now, they have a smooth, fake, before them, and they have
[01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:58.680]  that boon, and they are a horror, and a curse, and an embarrassment to their children, please.
[01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:04.560]  Yes, but we also are an embarrassment when we don't rise to the challenge and defeat
[01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:09.080]  them and allow this corruption to grow and grow and grow until the society goes into
[01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:13.880]  a nightmare, and that's called tyranny, and we're now going into tyranny by any benchmark,
[01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:19.600]  by any measurement, because we've been too passive as a whole, but now the awakening
[01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:22.920]  is happening, and it's very, very exciting.
[01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:28.360]  Jera, what are your predictions going into 2011?
[01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:33.760]  My predictions are that we have victory, and our hope is really real.
[01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:43.760]  There is truth, truth always reigns, and we need to get together and do creative ideas,
[01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:50.760]  and never allow fear and doubt to come into our souls and our hearts and our minds, because
[01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:55.240]  we are on the side of the angels, and happiness is what we're good at.
[01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:57.760]  No, Jera, you're right, you're right, and we don't have a choice.
[01:14:57.760 --> 01:14:59.480]  I mean, we know where tyranny goes.
[01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:01.280]  We've got to step up and say no now.
[01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:02.280]  Great talking to you.
[01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:06.000]  I'm going to break here in a moment and come right back with Nick, Manny, Laura, Bob, Andrew,
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:14.960]  Tim, Henry, Garfield, coming up after the break, but I do just want to make this point.
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:21.400]  Folks, if we can get the general public to understand that we're losing our economy,
[01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:26.720]  we're losing our dignity, we're losing our freedom, we're losing our sovereignty, because
[01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:30.960]  we've made sports number one, or we've made partying number one, or we've made making
[01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:36.240]  money number one, we have to come together for liberty, or we'll lose it.
[01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:40.760]  We'll lose that engine of everything that we call prosperity.
[01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:46.280]  And if you simply see yourselves as leaders and start doing little things every day to
[01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:50.640]  awaken your friends, your family, your neighbors, and to take over your local towns and cities
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:55.000]  peacefully through the political process, there's no way we can lose.
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:16:02.600]  The truth will win, you just got to carry the ball, we'll be right back with your calls.
[01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:06.320]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:09.480]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:13.840]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:14.840]  at home.
[01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:19.480]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are
[01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:20.600]  calling the shots.
[01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:25.800]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:31.280]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel
[01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:35.920]  held bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:40.320]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists, they're asking for more matches, and the Congress
[01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:42.360]  is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:48.320]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:49.720]  of the Republic.
[01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:55.800]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com, or watch it online right

[01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:00.600]  Thank you.
[01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:05.240]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:09.600]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:13.920]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:15.200]  allows you to have.
[01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:16.200]  It's true.
[01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:20.920]  The government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:25.240]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:29.240]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:32.720]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:36.440]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[01:18:36.440 --> 01:18:41.200]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:44.960]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:46.360]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:50.600]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:04.280]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot Movement.

[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:19.200]  We're looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:28.200]  Not worried about them moving itself, closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:34.200]  I'm looking for America.
[01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:39.200]  Where American and be proud, go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:43.200]  Land on the free and my home of the brave.
[01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:49.200]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:52.200]  Long gone.
[01:19:52.200 --> 01:19:55.200]  But I know in my heart it's still America.
[01:19:55.200 --> 01:20:10.200]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America today.
[01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:37.200]  Okay, I do have a bunch of economic police state military news.
[01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:41.200]  I want to smatter in here, but let's continue with your calls.
[01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:48.200]  What you think was most important in 2010, where you see things going in 2011.
[01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:53.200]  Let's go ahead and talk to Nick in Pennsylvania and Nick here on the air.
[01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:55.200]  Let's get going.
[01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:56.200]  Hey, buddy, go ahead.
[01:20:56.200 --> 01:20:57.200]  You're on air.
[01:20:57.200 --> 01:21:00.200]  First time caller and long time.
[01:21:00.200 --> 01:21:01.200]  Welcome.
[01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:03.200]  I just, I just said, thank you.
[01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:06.200]  I just had a three points to bring up this morning.
[01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:08.200]  I found it kind of odd.
[01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:14.200]  I was watching some morning news TV here in Pittsburgh and I was watching some business
[01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:16.200]  in Pittsburgh type show.
[01:21:16.200 --> 01:21:24.200]  They had a goofy host on and he actually brought on two members of the Rand Corporation and
[01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:30.200]  they're celebrating the 10 year anniversary of the Rand Corporation in Pittsburgh.
[01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:34.200]  And they have an office near the University of Pittsburgh.
[01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:40.200]  I just thought that was kind of odd because personally I popped into my mind was the average
[01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:45.200]  audience of this type of show is they have a lot of fluff news, but the average audience
[01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:48.200]  is not going to know who the Rand Corporation is.
[01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:54.200]  So I just thought that was, well, for those that don't know, it's been declassified and
[01:21:54.200 --> 01:22:00.200]  I've also had people like Alex Abaya researcher, the only person ever be allowed by Rand into
[01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:01.200]  their annals.
[01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:07.200]  And we have that hour plus special interview video interview posted at prisonplanet.tv just
[01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:09.200]  went up about a week ago with Alex Abaya.
[01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:10.200]  He's also been a guest here.
[01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:14.200]  So people can search the archives for the audio interviews, but they brought him in because
[01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:19.200]  he'd written kind of establishment books in the past, but he discovered the world government
[01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:20.200]  was real.
[01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:26.200]  They plan to build up the world government, have the military industrial complex take
[01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:28.200]  over the United States.
[01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:35.200]  And they do then want to have a limited nuclear war with China and Russia to totally destroy
[01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:40.200]  the political system of the United States to then bring in a hyper police state.
[01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:45.200]  And Rand Corporation has written the federalization of law enforcement programs that were going
[01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:48.200]  under the threat fusion centers.
[01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:55.200]  They've developed more than any other company out there, almost everything that we live
[01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:56.200]  under today.
[01:22:56.200 --> 01:23:01.200]  And it is an extremely wicked organization, very evil.
[01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:03.200]  And openly so.
[01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:10.200]  And their mascot is a mushroom cloud and they have that out front.
[01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:17.200]  They're big California, Los Angeles headquarters, a giant steel mushroom cloud.
[01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:22.200]  And we've had our cameras out there to videotape it, but you tell the average yuppie that they
[01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:23.200]  just giggle and laugh.
[01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:27.200]  They'd rather talk about, you know, the NFL or something, but this is what we're facing.
[01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:29.200]  It's what Eisenhower warned us about.
[01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:35.200]  It was the Rand Corporation type people, people tied into it with general, with LL Lemninser,
[01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:39.200]  the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that came to Eisenhower and said, we want to bomb
[01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:40.200]  US cities.
[01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:42.200]  We want to go ahead and have a nuclear war.
[01:23:42.200 --> 01:23:47.200]  We might even stage it ourselves and blame it on the Russians.
[01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:49.200]  And Eisenhower said, you're completely insane.
[01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:51.200]  And then he left office.
[01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:53.200]  Kennedy fired him when they came to Kennedy with the plan.
[01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:56.200]  And so, you know, they took care of Kennedy real well.
[01:23:56.200 --> 01:23:59.200]  But they've been planning this all along with their underground bases and the rest of it.
[01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:04.200]  And it's actually a genius plan from their perspective, because after the military industrial
[01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:09.200]  complex either nukes us and blames it on the Russians and Chinese and then wipes them out,
[01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:12.200]  then they will emerge and rule the planet.
[01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:18.200]  But again, Alex Ibea was able to get into their own documents and it's all true.
[01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:19.200]  Anything else, Nick?
[01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:20.200]  Yeah.
[01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:21.200]  Yeah.
[01:24:21.200 --> 01:24:22.200]  A couple of things.
[01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:23.200]  I'll go real quick.
[01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:31.200]  There's a parking prevention situation in Pittsburgh and the mayor is kind of spearheading that.
[01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:32.200]  Yeah.
[01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:36.200]  They're all raising hundreds of new taxes everywhere, which is impossible to ever pay
[01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:38.200]  off the fake derivatives debt.
[01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:42.200]  But they're telling everybody the increased taxes will ensure the economy when only writing
[01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:45.200]  off the trillions in derivatives will do that.
[01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:46.200]  Great.
[01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:47.200]  And G.P.
[01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:51.200]  Morgan was actually considered for garage management citywide.
[01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:55.200]  Well, for those that don't know, instead of me interrupting, tell them about the latest
[01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:57.200]  program in your city.
[01:24:57.200 --> 01:25:02.200]  I'm not really well versed on it.
[01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:08.200]  It's an ongoing thing in the Pittsburgh Post Gazette, but I don't really know what's
[01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:09.200]  going on.
[01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:11.200]  But I just, you know, once I heard G.P.
[01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:19.200]  Morgan was in the list of putting bids in to manage these city parking garages.
[01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:21.200]  I was just like, you know, dumb.
[01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:24.200]  But I want to hear about the program because I've seen similar ones.
[01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:29.200]  I didn't see it in Pittsburgh where they raised taxes and claim it's to sure up pension funds.
[01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:30.200]  Right.
[01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:31.200]  Right.
[01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:37.200]  They want to raise the parking leases, the garages, the parking spaces.
[01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:42.200]  And those go for, you know, hundreds of dollars a month.
[01:25:42.200 --> 01:25:47.200]  And, you know, they want to take that money over the next, I think it's 15 years.
[01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:48.200]  Sure.
[01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:49.200]  Yeah.
[01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:53.200]  Now it's called austerity and it's in all the IMF and World Bank plans.
[01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:58.200]  And they always tell the countries, pass all these new taxes, hand over the Greek islands,
[01:25:58.200 --> 01:26:02.200]  raise your taxes, you know, in Ireland, raise your taxes in the U.S.
[01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:06.200]  But none of that money is slated to go to actually pay down the debt.
[01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:07.200]  It's all a big fraud.
[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:08.200]  Appreciate the call, Nick.
[01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:09.200]  Great points.
[01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:12.200]  Manny in California, thanks for holding her on the ear.
[01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:14.200]  Yeah, you're doing Alex.
[01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:15.200]  Good, sir.
[01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:16.200]  Happy New Year to you.
[01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:17.200]  God bless you.
[01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:18.200]  Yes, sir.
[01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:19.200]  God bless you, sir.
[01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:21.200]  And thank you for all the work you're doing.
[01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:25.200]  I'm a low ranger out here in the city of hypocrisy, Hollywood.
[01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:29.200]  Actually, I just want to print out, actually tell you about a couple of points.
[01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:35.200]  First one, something that developed in 2010 that didn't get a lot of attention.
[01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:38.200]  And that's this character, Nicholas Sarkozy.
[01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:39.200]  Oh, France.
[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:40.200]  Very wicked.
[01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:41.200]  Yes.
[01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:42.200]  Yes, yes.
[01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:50.200]  This guy, you know, he exiled 12,000 Gypsies from France claiming 20% of the crimes were
[01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:56.200]  because of them in Paris, and they were claiming that they voluntarily charted them on flights
[01:26:56.200 --> 01:26:58.200]  claiming, you know, that the camps were a magnet.
[01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:03.200]  And then the video got released of them even beating up babies and beating women.
[01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:04.200]  And they were lying about it.
[01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:06.200]  And of course, where did Hitler start out?
[01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:08.200]  He started out with the Gypsies.
[01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:10.200]  And see, that's the issue.
[01:27:10.200 --> 01:27:13.200]  You let one group have their rights violated.
[01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:14.200]  That's unpopular.
[01:27:14.200 --> 01:27:17.200]  And tyrants always start with an unpopular group.
[01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:20.200]  Once they get away with that, they do it to everybody.
[01:27:20.200 --> 01:27:22.200]  And it's the same thing with the Muslims.
[01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:24.200]  Oh, we want to torture them.
[01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:25.200]  That's okay.
[01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:29.200]  But then we learn homeland securities for everybody else.
[01:27:29.200 --> 01:27:31.200]  But please continue.
[01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:32.200]  Yes.
[01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:34.200]  And yeah, you're absolutely right.
[01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:40.200]  French riot police were actually removing these families from their homes and crushing the so-called camps.
[01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:44.200]  And they were telling them not to return, giving them 270 euros.
[01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:46.200]  And dragging small babies around on the ground.
[01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:48.200]  Yes, it's incredible video.
[01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:49.200]  Yeah.
[01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:50.200]  Yeah, it's terrible.
[01:27:50.200 --> 01:27:52.200]  And it didn't get a lot of play that much.
[01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:55.200]  You know, there wasn't really talked about a lot on mainstream media.
[01:27:55.200 --> 01:27:58.200]  Well, that's because Sarkozy's a liberal.
[01:27:58.200 --> 01:28:00.200]  Liberals don't do things like that.
[01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:04.200]  I mean, even Germany's been decrying what they're doing because of their history.
[01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:07.200]  And there's, you know, there's different groups of gypsies and organizations.
[01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:14.200]  And it is true that part of some of the gypsy code is that, you know, you can basically rob anybody else that isn't a gypsy.
[01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:15.200]  And it's okay.
[01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:17.200]  But a lot of cultures have that attitude.
[01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:20.200]  And that's what I would call kind of tribalism.
[01:28:20.200 --> 01:28:24.200]  I mean, look, Native Americans, a lot of great things I admire about them.
[01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:26.200]  I've got some Native American blood in me.
[01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:28.200]  People are people.
[01:28:28.200 --> 01:28:29.200]  Humans act the same.
[01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:32.200]  But Native Americans were always raiding each other.
[01:28:32.200 --> 01:28:35.200]  I mean, Native Americans were always doing stuff like that.
[01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:37.200]  People always say, oh, the white man came and killed them all.
[01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:39.200]  Well, the white man did do some things that were bad.
[01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:40.200]  That's true.
[01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:42.200]  But I've read the history.
[01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:47.200]  Most of the time it was one Native tribe coming and begging, please help me wipe out my neighbors.
[01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:49.200]  I mean, it's just people are people.
[01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:54.200]  Whether they're German, Chinese, Native American, we all do the same kind of stuff.
[01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:55.200]  We'll be right back with more calls.
[01:28:55.200 --> 01:28:57.200]  Manny, great hearing from you.
[01:28:57.200 --> 01:28:59.200]  Stay with us.
[01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:04.200]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.

[01:30:00.200 --> 01:30:08.200]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:30:08.200 --> 01:30:11.200]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:30:11.200 --> 01:30:16.200]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:19.200]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:24.200]  The crazy part is, he's usually right. You see, he predicted the collapse of GM.
[01:30:24.200 --> 01:30:28.200]  Panny Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:30:28.200 --> 01:30:31.200]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:37.200]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:30:37.200 --> 01:30:39.200]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:43.200]  I can't stress this enough. You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:47.200]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:52.200]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:30:52.200 --> 01:30:58.200]  That's End of America. The number 3.com. Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:30:58.200 --> 01:31:00.200]  That's End of America 3.com.

[01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:24.200]  Number 3. In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:32:24.200 --> 01:32:28.200]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:31.200]  Number 4. Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:32:31.200 --> 01:32:35.200]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[01:32:35.200 --> 01:32:40.200]  Number 5. A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:32:40.200 --> 01:32:45.200]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors.

[01:33:01.200 --> 01:33:05.200]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[01:33:05.200 --> 01:33:15.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:33:36.200 --> 01:33:48.200]  Oh, kind of like George W. Bush protected Bill Clinton when he got into office in 2001 and how Nancy Pelosi and Obama had protected Bush
[01:33:48.200 --> 01:33:50.200]  and all the crimes that were committed under him.
[01:33:50.200 --> 01:33:52.200]  I'm talking about no-bid contracts.
[01:33:52.200 --> 01:33:57.200]  You know, you can say, oh, I like illegal wars. I like lying about WMDs. I like torture.
[01:33:57.200 --> 01:34:04.200]  But what about the no-bid contracts and things like that?
[01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:11.200]  What about all the war profiteering? What about all the things that are confirmed?
[01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:20.200]  But the new Congress says it's setting its eyes on oversight and plans to repeal or challenge last year's healthcare overhaul.
[01:34:20.200 --> 01:34:23.200]  Well, you've got a whole bunch of states lining up against it.
[01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:26.200]  You've already got federal judges ruling against it.
[01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:29.200]  But it doesn't matter. The bureaucracy is still implementing it.
[01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:33.200]  In fact, I've got reports here, and this isn't just my opinion.
[01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:37.200]  I've seen these reports over the years, over and over and over again.
[01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:45.200]  I've watched Tony Blair four or five years ago on C-SPAN in the House of Commons over and over again when I've watched it.
[01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:49.200]  One of the main questions that get thrown at prime ministers during prime minister's questions.
[01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:53.200]  And I saw the same thing with Gordon Brown and now the new guy.
[01:34:53.200 --> 01:35:00.200]  The conservatives will get up and bring up, well, this lady had a brain tumor and you made them wait a year and a half and they died,
[01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:08.200]  even though the tumor was almost 100% operable if they were given a surgery in two months, but the waiting list.
[01:35:08.200 --> 01:35:13.200]  And I see the reports out of Europe every day like this mail online story.
[01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:21.200]  Swede told he had cancer and forced to have his sexual organ amputated following a year of misdiagnosis.
[01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:23.200]  And it turns out they knew he had cancer.
[01:35:23.200 --> 01:35:26.200]  It happens over and over again under socialized systems.
[01:35:26.200 --> 01:35:28.200]  They just say, go home, go home, go home.
[01:35:28.200 --> 01:35:30.200]  And then you don't get the surgery.
[01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:32.200]  I mean, have you ever been to a Social Security office?
[01:35:32.200 --> 01:35:34.200]  Have you ever been to a government office?
[01:35:34.200 --> 01:35:35.200]  How horrible they are.
[01:35:35.200 --> 01:35:37.200]  Is this what you want with your health care?
[01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:40.200]  Look at this story out of the Sacramento B.
[01:35:40.200 --> 01:35:45.200]  Sacramento girl needed amputations at her five hour wait at emergency room.
[01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:48.200]  She had flesh eating bacteria.
[01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:54.200]  Big health care changes arrive in the new year.
[01:35:54.200 --> 01:35:56.200]  The Wall Street Journal reports.
[01:35:56.200 --> 01:35:58.200]  And who wrote the health care bill?
[01:35:58.200 --> 01:36:01.200]  Not some communist under a toadstool.
[01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:05.200]  Not some bleeding heart who thinks they're going to get a free ride in life.
[01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:09.200]  No, the insurance companies on record wrote it.
[01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:11.200]  All right, let's go back to your calls.
[01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:12.200]  It's just sick.
[01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:14.200]  So we'll see what these Republicans do.
[01:36:14.200 --> 01:36:17.200]  Congress has the lowest approval rating in its history.
[01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:25.200]  And the good news is I'm already hearing Republican constituents getting angry that they made so many deals with Obama and the lame duck.
[01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:32.200]  And so within months of the Republicans getting in, if they don't deliver on everything they promised,
[01:36:32.200 --> 01:36:36.200]  you're going to see the same thing at the town halls with them being routed.
[01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:42.200]  And no amount of staged terror is going to get the public to go worship government anymore.
[01:36:42.200 --> 01:36:44.200]  Humpty Dumpty done fell off the wall, folks.
[01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:46.200]  People are waking up.
[01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:49.200]  Laura in Alabama, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:50.200]  Thanks for holding.
[01:36:50.200 --> 01:36:53.200]  Alex, I love you.
[01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:55.200]  You rock my world.
[01:36:55.200 --> 01:36:56.200]  You really do.
[01:36:56.200 --> 01:36:57.200]  Oh, no, please, please.
[01:36:57.200 --> 01:36:59.200]  I mean, like Limbaugh says, just say dead-os.
[01:36:59.200 --> 01:37:00.200]  I appreciate you.
[01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:02.200]  What's on your mind?
[01:37:02.200 --> 01:37:09.200]  Well, I know you want to talk about the major things for 2010, but I just want to tell you first of all,
[01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:19.200]  I recently had the opportunity to participate in a Boy Scout troop fundraiser where I could send popcorn to the troops overseas
[01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:27.200]  and include a personal note which I told them, hey, check out infowars.com and Prison Planet TV.
[01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:32.200]  And I also do this, and I know you're probably going to say, no, don't do that.
[01:37:32.200 --> 01:37:34.200]  You can't stop me.
[01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:38.200]  And I use a big, fat, sharpie.
[01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:44.200]  And I write infowars.com and Prison Planet TV on my federal reserve notes.
[01:37:44.200 --> 01:37:51.200]  Well, I mean, it is a fraudulent debt instrument, not what this country had before 1913.
[01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:59.200]  And a lot of people are writing on their money, and the message is spreading, and it's really worrying the system.
[01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:08.200]  But at the same time, I mean, I think taking the instrument of our enslavement and turning it into an instrument of liberty is very effective.
[01:38:08.200 --> 01:38:14.200]  And I haven't seen anybody prosecuted for that, but they do have some cockamamie laws on the books.
[01:38:14.200 --> 01:38:24.200]  So I would tell folks publicly, you might not want to do that, but certainly I won't get too angry at you for that, Laura.
[01:38:24.200 --> 01:38:31.200]  Now, Laura, what do you think some of the most important things that happened in 2010 were?
[01:38:31.200 --> 01:38:38.200]  Well, probably the thing that most of the Florida heads know about is the TSA.
[01:38:38.200 --> 01:38:45.200]  But personally, I think the biggest issue is the GMO stuff that's going to kill everybody.
[01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:56.200]  And you know what? I don't understand why they don't just go ahead and kill everybody, and there'll be that much less people that they got to put into the system.
[01:38:56.200 --> 01:39:07.200]  Well, ma'am, if they started flying around in helicopters tomorrow, which actually was leaked in 1999 that the military does have helicopters with nerve gas in them.
[01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:16.200]  The Texas Sunshine Project got those documents. The Marine Corps requested that they unpublish them, but it's still online at the Google archive.
[01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:27.200]  But they have helicopters with nerve gas, and they also have helicopters with just regular opiate knockout gas, but they estimate it would still kill a lot of people by fires and automobile accidents.
[01:39:27.200 --> 01:39:34.200]  So they're ready to fly over every city and knock everybody out or kill them as crazy as that sounds. That's public information now.
[01:39:34.200 --> 01:39:43.200]  But it would be too obvious. They want a soft kill. The average military people, or good men and women, they wouldn't know what they were part of.
[01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:54.200]  Now, the average bureaucrats would finally wake up. They've got to slowly do this by stealth because most of their people are compartmentalized and aren't aware of what's happening, Laura.
[01:39:54.200 --> 01:40:02.200]  Okay? Now, they are moving in the next five years to have most of the Air Force being drone or computer operated.
[01:40:02.200 --> 01:40:11.200]  And as they move to a more Skynet Terminator-style system, it will allow the globalist to engage in these type of operations a little bit easier.
[01:40:11.200 --> 01:40:24.200]  If they do go with the Megadeth mass culling, The World Without People Scenario, which the you and others do talk about, they'll release a super deadly version, probably, of the mousepox that kills over 99%.
[01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:32.200]  It's almost 100%. It's like 99.8% in the studies that are public of mammals. They have to tailor it for the species.
[01:40:32.200 --> 01:40:41.200]  But a weaponized mousepox, or a airborne weaponized Ebola that'll kill over 90%, that's what they've been looking at doing.
[01:40:41.200 --> 01:40:45.200]  And then they'll say, oh, we don't know where it came from, or Al Qaeda did it.
[01:40:45.200 --> 01:40:51.200]  And they have been putting this big police state in grid in place ahead of something like that.
[01:40:51.200 --> 01:41:00.200]  And so if that does unfold, remember it's the eugenicist. Laura, great to hear from you. Keep it up. Bob in Arizona, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:41:00.200 --> 01:41:08.200]  Hi, Alex. God bless you. I just want to thank you for letting me be on your show.
[01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:17.200]  Alex, I've been wanting to ask you this question for quite some time, because I know that you're probably able to have the answer for me.
[01:41:17.200 --> 01:41:32.200]  I've been awake personally for years, and on my mother's side of the family, I'm like you, Alex. My heritage goes back to the Mayflower on my mother's side.
[01:41:32.200 --> 01:41:48.200]  I'm a pilgrim. But the downside of that is I've also found out that my uncle is a 33rd degree Scottish right freemason.
[01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:57.200]  He told me that he got to the point where it was taking the result or whatever, and he didn't go any further with it.
[01:41:57.200 --> 01:42:07.200]  I don't know. All I know is that when I told him that Queen Elizabeth, we never really did get our independence,
[01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:17.200]  that Queen Elizabeth, you know, Liz Windsor, A.K.A. while Saxe, Colbert, and Gotha, they are running the show.
[01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:21.200]  And ever since I told them that, he hasn't talked to me.
[01:42:21.200 --> 01:42:27.200]  He normally, you know, gives me calls on his happy birthday. He sends me a Christmas card.
[01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:33.200]  Ever since they mentioned that to him, the first of the year, I've not heard anything from him.
[01:42:33.200 --> 01:42:40.200]  Well, let me come back and try to answer your question. I appreciate your call, but the average Mason is not a bad person.
[01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:49.200]  But at the 33rd degree level, they are initiated that it is a Luciferian right, and that Lucifer is the God they're worshiping.
[01:42:49.200 --> 01:42:56.200]  And that's in the books written by the top Masons, Albert, Pike, and others, so lower-level Masons that don't know that,
[01:42:56.200 --> 01:42:59.200]  you should really find out the religion you're part of.
[01:43:02.200 --> 01:43:09.200]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:14.200]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[01:43:14.200 --> 01:43:20.200]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:25.200]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:33.200]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, held bent on destroying sovereignty,
[01:43:33.200 --> 01:43:35.200]  and on its ashes, constructing world government.
[01:43:35.200 --> 01:43:42.200]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[01:43:42.200 --> 01:43:44.200]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:43:44.200 --> 01:43:49.200]  And right now, in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:43:49.200 --> 01:43:54.200]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.

[01:45:16.200 --> 01:45:19.200]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:21.200]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:28.200]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Panny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:45:28.200 --> 01:45:31.200]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:38.200]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener.
[01:45:38.200 --> 01:45:42.200]  I can't stress this enough. You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:45:42.200 --> 01:45:46.200]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.

[01:46:02.200 --> 01:46:03.200]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:46:03.200 --> 01:46:09.200]  You've heard me talk about the delicious, easy to fix and very storable foods from eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:46:09.200 --> 01:46:14.200]  I've told you for years that eFoodsDirect has the best storable food on the planet.
[01:46:14.200 --> 01:46:18.200]  Now it's that time of year again, and their holiday special is here.

[01:46:50.200 --> 01:47:10.200]  That's 800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:47:10.200 --> 01:47:17.200]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:17.200 --> 01:47:26.200]  Okay, it's the last segment. I want to jam in some calls and a few other news items, and I don't want to get off into masons here because it won't do it justice,
[01:47:26.200 --> 01:47:32.200]  but perhaps I should do a whole hour sometime on the weekday show from 11 to 2 central on this.
[01:47:32.200 --> 01:47:42.200]  I had a lot of ancestors that were masons. Our country, more than half the founders were masons, and they were good men.
[01:47:42.200 --> 01:47:52.200]  There's different families of Freemasonry. It predates Christianity, so of course it's got Babylon mystery religion type stuff in it.
[01:47:52.200 --> 01:48:02.200]  It goes back to Egypt. Mathematics was incredibly valuable. Architecture was incredibly valuable information, and they had secret schools that would teach it.
[01:48:02.200 --> 01:48:06.200]  To make a long story short, that's how it started. Different varieties of it.
[01:48:06.200 --> 01:48:13.200]  But in the National Archives at the Library of Congress, just search George Washington Illuminati letters.
[01:48:13.200 --> 01:48:21.200]  You'll be at the National Archives. They're real letters. He's talking about the Illuminati taking over Scottish right Freemasonry.
[01:48:21.200 --> 01:48:27.200]  He was a Mason, fought tyranny, good guy. Now, you judge a tree by its fruits.
[01:48:27.200 --> 01:48:37.200]  You look at Masonic Ribs today, they're promoting police state DNA kits for kids, but they think it's good.
[01:48:37.200 --> 01:48:46.200]  That's because it's just like everything else. You know, you got good Catholics out there, but the Pope's always promoting one world government and stuff.
[01:48:46.200 --> 01:48:51.200]  You've got good Protestants out there, but look at all these Protestant leaders supporting the police state.
[01:48:51.200 --> 01:48:58.200]  And Pat Robertson saying, you know, microchips aren't bad in your skin. I mean, I've got them on video.
[01:48:58.200 --> 01:49:06.200]  It's wickedness in high places. And I mean, here's a video of a Christian ministry online, a lot of good videos they put out.
[01:49:06.200 --> 01:49:15.200]  Outside a hospital, a Shriners going in. That's the charity arm, the philanthropic arm of the Masons.
[01:49:15.200 --> 01:49:21.200]  And the guy's got his Mason hat for radio listeners. I'm describing it. And the guy says, do you worship Lucifer?
[01:49:21.200 --> 01:49:24.200]  And the guy's, by the time he turns his camera on, he says, I am Lucifer.
[01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:28.200]  And so I'll go ahead and play that audio and video here right now.
[01:49:28.200 --> 01:49:40.200]  Now they believe Lucifer and Jesus are one of the same. They don't think they're worshiping a guy in red pajamas, but the point is, that's what you learn in high level Masonry, at least since the Illuminati took over. Here it is.
[01:49:40.200 --> 01:49:50.200]  Lucifer, what is your problem? Just that, sir. I'm a Christian, sir. I'm pure and virtuous and wholesome and innocent. How can you say anything about me?
[01:49:50.200 --> 01:49:58.200]  Sir, you need to be born again. I am born again. Now, did you just say that you're Lucifer? I am Lucifer. Okay, define Lucifer for me.
[01:49:58.200 --> 01:50:11.200]  I am a pure, virtuous, wholesome, innocent individual that's out to help people. Lucifer is? Say that again. Lucifer is a pure, holy, virtuous. Now, I see the Lucifer that God created.
[01:50:11.200 --> 01:50:17.200]  That's the same one. Oh, man, this is great. I'm going to put this on the Internet. Oh, God bless you, brother.
[01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:23.200]  Because that's exactly what the Shriners and Masons teaches at Lucifer. Lucifer is light. And you're confirming it.
[01:50:23.200 --> 01:50:34.200]  What are you confirming? That's enough. It goes on from there. You just can, what's the name of the video, Jaren? Want to give it on there?
[01:50:34.200 --> 01:50:41.200]  Shriners praises Lucifer. You can put it infowars.com on the back of that and find it too, because we posted it many times.
[01:50:41.200 --> 01:50:54.200]  Look, I don't sit up here in judgment. Okay, and I'm not, all I'm telling you is any organization that's secretive, and you got to go up to secret degrees to find out who you're really worshipping,
[01:50:54.200 --> 01:51:03.200]  that's because they'd burn you at the stake for that stuff 500 years ago. And I'm not saying that's good either. I'm for religious freedom. Okay?
[01:51:03.200 --> 01:51:13.200]  But let's get honest about what masonry has certainly become. I've done some studying, and it may not have always been the way it is now.
[01:51:13.200 --> 01:51:21.200]  And your average porch mason, here's an example. I'm part of the show, Decoded, an episode coming up on History Channel.
[01:51:21.200 --> 01:51:33.200]  But Mark Dice, he was in an episode about the Statue of Liberty, is an androgynous Lucifer figure, male and female, and it's really a man in drag.
[01:51:33.200 --> 01:51:41.200]  It's more male than female, and it's got the seven horns, and the French who made it said that, and they make fun of Mark Dice on the show,
[01:51:41.200 --> 01:51:47.200]  and then at the end they go talk to a professor, and he goes, well, it is Lucifer, but not the bad one they're saying.
[01:51:47.200 --> 01:51:59.200]  So, you know, that's the type of stuff going on. So I'm kind of a little apprehensive about the Bohemian Grove episode I'm in of that.
[01:51:59.200 --> 01:52:07.200]  But they seem like nice folks and nice crew, so we'll see what happens with all of that.
[01:52:07.200 --> 01:52:13.200]  But, you know, they go from denying their worshiping Lucifer to going, yeah, we like Lucifer, but it's not the Lucifer you thought.
[01:52:13.200 --> 01:52:21.200]  But I want to say this, if the Masons aren't engines of New World Order, where are your fruits?
[01:52:21.200 --> 01:52:27.200]  Where are the cops that are Masons fighting tyranny? I mean, where are you defending the Bill of Rights and Constitution?
[01:52:27.200 --> 01:52:32.200]  Where are you? Because there's no doubt we're losing our freedoms. There's no doubt.
[01:52:32.200 --> 01:52:37.200]  The average, you know, good old boy says, well, what do I have to worry about losing my freedom? What do I have to hide?
[01:52:37.200 --> 01:52:46.200]  It's not that you have something to hide. It's that history shows 100% of the time you give up your liberties, you're going to get hurt real bad.
[01:52:46.200 --> 01:52:53.200]  See, tyranny is scary, ladies and gentlemen, and I know our regular audience knows that, but for new listeners out there, this isn't fun.
[01:52:53.200 --> 01:53:00.200]  What's happening? We got to turn the tide here. Andrew in New York, Andrew, you're on the air.
[01:53:00.200 --> 01:53:04.200]  Thank you, Alex, for getting me on. I've been waiting for a long while right now.
[01:53:04.200 --> 01:53:15.200]  Now, I really want to talk about, first, I want to talk about what is going on in New York City about a school chancellor being a CFR member.
[01:53:15.200 --> 01:53:19.200]  This is heartbreaking news. Let me go ahead and say it.
[01:53:19.200 --> 01:53:21.200]  Okay, you're on air.
[01:53:21.200 --> 01:53:23.200]  Yeah, can you hear me?
[01:53:23.200 --> 01:53:25.200]  Yeah.
[01:53:25.200 --> 01:53:44.200]  First of all, it's been a minute in the examiner that, I forgot, Kathy Price, someone with a Kathy, she was a CFR member who worked for corporations at Finance Hitler during the 1930s in the Holocaust.
[01:53:44.200 --> 01:53:47.200]  And you can find this in many places.
[01:53:47.200 --> 01:53:55.200]  But I mean, I don't know who you're talking about specifically, Andrew. I mean, there's over 5,000 members of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[01:53:55.200 --> 01:54:00.200]  And the CFR at the top openly wants world government, openly wants the end of the U.S.
[01:54:00.200 --> 01:54:09.200]  Most of their 5,000 members, like Angelina Joe Lee, they're joining it because they really think they're helping people, just like, you know, a lot of other organizations.
[01:54:09.200 --> 01:54:17.200]  So, yes, the CFR did finance Hitler to a great extent, but that was back in the 30s with Prescott Bush and others.
[01:54:17.200 --> 01:54:23.200]  I think to say that CFR members today are all connected to the Holocaust. I don't think that's fair.
[01:54:23.200 --> 01:54:29.200]  I mean, was she alive in the 30s at the CFR? Or is she a CFR member now?
[01:54:29.200 --> 01:54:35.200]  She's a CFR member who worked with corporations at Finance Hitler.
[01:54:35.200 --> 01:54:40.200]  What, Brown Brother Harriman and stuff?
[01:54:40.200 --> 01:54:49.200]  Yeah, and Coca-Cola. And this is the mayor here in New York who was fighting against Coca-Cola, or is he really?
[01:54:49.200 --> 01:54:54.200]  Mike Bloomberg picked her, and the judge obviously confirmed her.
[01:54:54.200 --> 01:54:57.200]  Well, I mean, and I appreciate your call, Andrew. We got to move quick.
[01:54:57.200 --> 01:55:05.200]  The same Mike Bloomberg that while the unions are on strike, babies are being born in doorways and dying over nine hours of the same Mike Bloomberg,
[01:55:05.200 --> 01:55:13.200]  who nationwide is pushing to ban the Second Amendment, who's getting ready to run for president, who makes Al Gore look like a conservative.
[01:55:13.200 --> 01:55:19.200]  The same Michael Bloomberg who's a globalist. You mean that guy? What a nightmare.
[01:55:19.200 --> 01:55:23.200]  Tim in Tennessee. Tim, you're on the air.
[01:55:23.200 --> 01:55:28.200]  Well, good afternoon. Anyway, Rand Paul, that's all I want to say.
[01:55:28.200 --> 01:55:37.200]  Rand Paul got elected this year despite the media's full court-pressed smear machine that shows the establishment of dinosaur media is out of bullets.
[01:55:37.200 --> 01:55:48.200]  That's right. And having people like Slick Willie go in and promote his crap, trying to down Rand Paul, and he failed. That was a victory for us.
[01:55:48.200 --> 01:56:00.200]  Absolutely. Because 10 years ago or even five years ago, the full media claiming that Rand Paul was a vampire, that he hurt women, you know, that he was a Chinese jet pilot from Mars.
[01:56:00.200 --> 01:56:08.200]  All of that ridiculous stuff blew up in their face. And now when the media attacks you, it's a badge of courage. They've lost credibility.
[01:56:08.200 --> 01:56:12.200]  They've lost the initiative. You're awesome. I'm going to end.
[01:56:12.200 --> 01:56:18.200]  I want to go to Harry and Canada and Garfield in Texas and people in South Dakota and you name it.
[01:56:18.200 --> 01:56:22.200]  But let's go to Garfield real fast in Texas. Garfield, you're on the air.
[01:56:22.200 --> 01:56:25.200]  Yeah. Good afternoon, Alex, or evening.
[01:56:25.200 --> 01:56:26.200]  Welcome, Garfield.
[01:56:26.200 --> 01:56:32.200]  Yeah. I just want to say that the Info Wars in the Money Bomb was one of the best things in 2010.
[01:56:32.200 --> 01:56:42.200]  And it's going to be one of the best things in 2011 in a Diamond Info War evangelist. And I've turned a lot of people on to Info Wars.
[01:56:42.200 --> 01:56:51.200]  And you're well known in South America, I'll have you know, even though you don't have a Spanish, what do you call it?
[01:56:51.200 --> 01:56:52.200]  Translator.
[01:56:52.200 --> 01:56:53.200]  Yeah.
[01:56:53.200 --> 01:57:03.200]  We need one. If we had the money or somebody volunteers, we'd do it. But I know a lot of people take our films and translate them into Spanish, Chinese, Russian, German.
[01:57:03.200 --> 01:57:13.200]  You name it. Japanese. And I know a lot of folks are translating the show and people in Latin America, they've already experienced the big central banks raping them.
[01:57:13.200 --> 01:57:15.200]  So they really get it. It's very exciting.
[01:57:15.200 --> 01:57:24.200]  Yeah, that would be off the record. They're welcoming that alternative media news source Info Wars with the open arms down there.
[01:57:24.200 --> 01:57:30.200]  As a matter of fact, that helped out with that pandemic thing. I think the Minister of Health was listening to your show.
[01:57:30.200 --> 01:57:37.200]  Well, I know transcripts of this show have been in hundreds of Latin American newspapers. It's very exciting. God bless you. I'm out of time.
[01:57:37.200 --> 01:57:45.200]  I'll try to get to everybody tomorrow. 11 a.m. Central Info Wars.com is the website. Great job, crew. It's great to be here with you live in 2011.
[01:57:45.200 --> 01:57:50.200]  Let's bring down the new world order in 2011 or get a good start on it.
[01:57:50.200 --> 01:57:55.200]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:57:55.200 --> 01:57:59.200]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:57:59.200 --> 01:58:05.200]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:58:05.200 --> 01:58:10.200]  It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:58:10.200 --> 01:58:15.200]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:58:15.200 --> 01:58:19.200]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:58:19.200 --> 01:58:22.200]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:58:22.200 --> 01:58:26.200]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[01:58:26.200 --> 01:58:31.200]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:58:31.200 --> 01:58:36.200]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
