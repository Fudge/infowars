[00:00.000 --> 00:07.640]  government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the
[00:07.640 --> 00:15.560]  GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:15.560 --> 00:20.880]  welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome I am not Alex Jones but I'm sitting in for
[00:20.880 --> 00:25.680]  him I am Jason Burmiss of a loose change I'll be here probably for the next three
[00:25.680 --> 00:29.880]  days and we got jam-packed shows for you we're gonna be taking your calls today
[00:29.880 --> 00:35.120]  alone we have Bob Chapman Peter Dale Scott William Lewis and Irene Spencer if
[00:35.120 --> 00:39.000]  you're not familiar with Irene Spencer she's one of the people that is involved
[00:39.000 --> 00:43.120]  in that whole siege in Texas in that polygamous camp I I'm pretty sure she's
[00:43.120 --> 00:47.080]  one of the women who actually got out of there so that should be interesting
[00:47.080 --> 00:51.840]  that's coming up at 2 o'clock Chapman at 11 30 so we got a half an hour before
[00:51.840 --> 00:56.280]  we go to any guess I just want to point out really quickly in the beginning that
[00:56.280 --> 01:01.480]  Alex Jones is going to be premiering the 9-11 Chronicles part one truth rising
[01:01.480 --> 01:07.120]  over at the Alamo Draft House now I just went to the Alamo Draft House for the
[01:07.120 --> 01:11.840]  first time I believe it was last week and it was really just a great time if
[01:11.840 --> 01:14.320]  you've never been there which I doubt if you're listening to this in your in
[01:14.320 --> 01:18.600]  Austin, Texas um it's amazing I mean you sit down you have a meal it's a very
[01:18.600 --> 01:21.720]  theater-like atmosphere huge screen and I don't even think I was in one of the
[01:21.720 --> 01:27.720]  bigger theaters and on Saturday May 17th at 4 p.m. or Sunday May 18th at 7 p.m.
[01:27.720 --> 01:33.480]  you can check out this new amazing film the 9-11 Chronicles part one and Alex
[01:33.480 --> 01:37.000]  really hasn't plugged it so I'm going to because I sit in an office all day while
[01:37.000 --> 01:41.640]  I'm editing my movie and Rob Jacobson the editor for the other film is behind me
[01:41.640 --> 01:45.440]  most of the time and I'm always checking out that film and it's awesome it is
[01:45.440 --> 01:49.880]  truly a different type of movie than Alex Jones has ever done it is cinema
[01:49.880 --> 01:54.440]  verite I know he's saying that over and over again but I really want you to take
[01:54.440 --> 01:58.840]  that as a perspective this is not an Alex Jones voiced over picture this is a
[01:58.840 --> 02:05.200]  totally different style of movie and it really shows you that 9-11 truth is not
[02:05.200 --> 02:10.880]  about just info wars.com or prisonplanet.com or we are change.org but
[02:10.880 --> 02:15.480]  around but about people around the world creating their own change by
[02:15.480 --> 02:21.160]  confronting the likes of Rudy Giuliani, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama,
[02:21.160 --> 02:28.400]  John McCain, Gary Hart and a whole host of others including Alan Greenspan as
[02:28.400 --> 02:34.600]  well as talking to I guess pop culture celebrities and icons such as George
[02:34.600 --> 02:40.720]  Carlin, Martin Sheen, Rosie O'Donnell, Jesse Ventura and even childhood actor
[02:40.720 --> 02:45.360]  Danny Bonaducci and I'm just really excited to see this movie come out I've
[02:45.360 --> 02:49.040]  seen Rob put a lot of hard work into it Alex put a lot of hard work into it too
[02:49.040 --> 02:51.840]  he was here late night going over the movie making sure it's perfect for you
[02:51.840 --> 02:56.640]  folks over at these screenings at the Alamo draft house and like I said I'm
[02:56.640 --> 03:01.400]  just totally impressed with it again so much different from anything else
[03:01.400 --> 03:07.240]  whereas you know other 9-11 films really try to focus in on the evidence this is
[03:07.240 --> 03:11.520]  focused in on the movement and how we can all create change in our lives in
[03:11.520 --> 03:15.840]  our communities and in the world because in case you didn't know folks our
[03:15.840 --> 03:21.040]  entire foreign and domestic domestic policy is still and I repeat this still
[03:21.040 --> 03:27.000]  based on what the government media has told us about 9-11 for example the
[03:27.000 --> 03:30.360]  other night when Alex was on her all though I was in the back office with
[03:30.360 --> 03:33.480]  Aaron Dykes and we were setting up the recorder so we could get that and throw
[03:33.480 --> 03:38.000]  it up on YouTube and prior to that was a Sean Hannity show and this is how
[03:38.000 --> 03:43.400]  relevant 9-11 still is they actually had on I guess it was somebody who
[03:43.400 --> 03:48.200]  Reverend Wright who's big in the news right now had quoted about 9-11 about
[03:48.200 --> 03:52.080]  chickens coming home to roost and this and that while Hannity had this guy on
[03:52.080 --> 03:57.600]  on the 15th and they literally ran a 10-minute segment from 915 all based on
[03:57.600 --> 04:02.720]  9-11 so why is this important well it's still on the front page constantly a
[04:02.720 --> 04:06.120]  couple weeks ago when I when I did this show and I was talking about how they
[04:06.120 --> 04:10.920]  were admitting to paying off top military personnel to be pundits on all the
[04:10.920 --> 04:17.840]  major networks such as CNN Fox News MSNBC yada yada yada right on the cover in
[04:17.840 --> 04:26.240]  this post 9-11 world it's a post 9-11 world well in a second I'm gonna I'm
[04:26.240 --> 04:30.160]  gonna bash that paradigm because if you found out yet the USS coal bombing
[04:30.160 --> 04:34.080]  suspects all got let go or they escaped terrorism was real that wouldn't happen
[04:34.080 --> 04:39.560]  folks we'll be back after this prisonplanet.com

[07:57.640 --> 08:05.920]  the GCN radio network all right ladies and gentlemen we are back and joining me
[08:05.920 --> 08:11.000]  right now before we get to the Cole story is a Trey our lovely producer here
[08:11.000 --> 08:16.200]  over at info wars and prison planet and we were trying to get on for you the
[08:16.200 --> 08:21.760]  apartment manager for the DC madam so we could discuss this whole letter thing
[08:21.760 --> 08:26.720]  and you know it's a big hot story over at info wars dot com and Jones report
[08:26.720 --> 08:31.720]  over by Aaron Dykes he really went through all this handwriting and found
[08:31.720 --> 08:35.120]  a few inconsistencies obviously the readers are finding even more but we
[08:35.120 --> 08:39.240]  tried to get on the the building manager and what happened Trey oh it's you know
[08:39.240 --> 08:43.680]  just due to I think just a lot of attention's been coming around and I
[08:43.680 --> 08:47.800]  think that the people who own the building and run the complex just aren't
[08:47.800 --> 08:52.760]  quite happy with all the attention that's coming over cross I remember that
[08:52.760 --> 08:59.200]  he mentioned several times that she left him several post-it notes she left him
[08:59.200 --> 09:05.000]  several post-it notes and writings and you know she signed several documents for
[09:05.000 --> 09:09.440]  him over the course of time that she lived there so he was pretty familiar
[09:09.440 --> 09:13.560]  with her handwriting and from what he saw as well it just did not look anything
[09:13.560 --> 09:16.680]  at all like you said he didn't think the signature matched up at all did he know
[09:16.680 --> 09:20.840]  not at all so he would love to come on it's just I think there's just been you
[09:20.840 --> 09:24.760]  know he's got to do his day job as well so I just don't think he's able to break
[09:24.760 --> 09:28.000]  apart and do interviews all day long and yeah and I think it's important for the
[09:28.000 --> 09:32.200]  listeners to bring these stories you know to other venues and Colin to other
[09:32.200 --> 09:35.200]  talk radio shows and talk about this because if we don't keep up on this
[09:35.200 --> 09:39.480]  issue trade is going to kind of go under the rug and who knows what she was
[09:39.480 --> 09:42.120]  going to reveal you know was it just going to be a clientele list was it
[09:42.120 --> 09:45.320]  going to be a clientele list along with their associates I know there's a few
[09:45.320 --> 09:49.840]  separate stories floating around especially by Wayne Madison that could
[09:49.840 --> 09:53.680]  show some prior involvement in 9-11 but you know when you're working at one of
[09:53.680 --> 09:57.960]  these buildings and there's a media firestorm after a friend of yours has
[09:57.960 --> 10:02.480]  been killed you know apparently you can only do so much well I'm sure you'd like
[10:02.480 --> 10:06.120]  to come out and talk more just like the other day but like I said I think the
[10:06.120 --> 10:10.500]  national media has gotten wind of it and it's not necessarily that the the
[10:10.500 --> 10:15.400]  building owners you know don't want him to help his friend I just think that you
[10:15.400 --> 10:18.840]  know anytime there's a situation like that people get all nervous about it and
[10:18.840 --> 10:21.880]  don't want to get involved even though that's the last thing people should be
[10:21.880 --> 10:24.640]  doing yeah they don't want a media circus outside of their building and
[10:24.640 --> 10:28.520]  really folks it's only a few members of the mainstream media that are even
[10:28.520 --> 10:31.960]  considering this a murder well the bottom line she paid her rent she wanted
[10:31.960 --> 10:36.120]  to pay her rent up she said people been following her I mean there's enough
[10:36.120 --> 10:41.280]  evidence out there to just add to open it to not say that it was a to rule a
[10:41.280 --> 10:45.920]  suicide right from the start it was ruled a suicide before it was even the
[10:45.920 --> 10:49.280]  case was seemed even close and in December she came in on this show and
[10:49.280 --> 10:52.280]  said she wasn't going to kill herself she went on other shows and said she
[10:52.280 --> 10:58.240]  wasn't gonna kill herself yet she hung herself in her mother's shed I even get
[10:58.240 --> 11:02.040]  a kick out of how a lot of the talk was six to seven years in prison when I
[11:02.040 --> 11:06.560]  don't I really don't honestly believe she would serve seven years in prison she
[11:06.560 --> 11:10.520]  maybe get a seven-year sentence but she would have been out and under a year I
[11:10.520 --> 11:14.640]  believe with you know work release a probation you know a lot of people don't
[11:14.640 --> 11:17.640]  know about those program but you could literally get a five-year sentence and
[11:17.640 --> 11:21.120]  do a year in prison yet silly to think that for a nonviolent crime she'd be
[11:21.120 --> 11:24.480]  sitting in jail for seven years yeah absolutely I don't see that absolutely
[11:24.480 --> 11:28.400]  when she was never really convicted of knowing anything about the prostitution
[11:28.400 --> 11:32.920]  in particular I think they got around some other kind of technicality so it's
[11:32.920 --> 11:37.840]  all tax evasion and stuff like yeah it's not even it's it's I don't think she
[11:37.840 --> 11:42.720]  would have been in prison that long no and so I don't see how having a book
[11:42.720 --> 11:47.040]  deal waiting for her how how I don't see her not seeing the light at the end of
[11:47.040 --> 11:50.760]  the tunnel with that situation I gotta agree with you 110% that's why it's
[11:50.760 --> 11:55.320]  important for our listeners to get out there check out info wars calm thanks
[11:55.320 --> 11:59.280]  try appreciate it check out prison planet calm there's a huge article up there
[11:59.280 --> 12:03.840]  with not only her suicide letters but actual letters that she mailed here so
[12:03.840 --> 12:07.920]  you can compare the real handwriting to the handwriting in those letters we
[12:07.920 --> 12:12.000]  want to hear your introspective into that we're gonna be getting into some jack
[12:12.000 --> 12:16.880]  boot cops later as well of course police pulling over and assaulting people in the
[12:16.880 --> 12:20.920]  car and then charging them with assault it's the new america folks it's it's how
[12:20.920 --> 12:26.080]  they do but I think this out of the washington post it came out sunday and
[12:26.080 --> 12:30.440]  it's been pretty ignored but again let me let me just read the first couple
[12:30.440 --> 12:35.440]  paragraphs here almost eight years after al-qaeda nearly sank the USS coal with an
[12:35.440 --> 12:41.000]  explosive stuff no motorboat killing 17 sailors all the defendants convicted in
[12:41.000 --> 12:45.680]  the attack have escaped from prison or been freed by Yemeni officials let me
[12:45.680 --> 12:49.720]  say that again all the defendants convicted in the attack have escaped
[12:49.720 --> 12:53.600]  from prison or been freed by Yemeni officials now why is this so important
[12:53.600 --> 12:58.760]  well let me tell you why it's so important if the government's version of
[12:58.760 --> 13:02.360]  terrorism if there was an al-qaeda member under every bed like they have you
[13:02.360 --> 13:06.360]  believe in blonde blue-haired al-qaeda members you know they're recruiting white
[13:06.360 --> 13:12.760]  people now these guys would be the guys in gitmo okay these guys would be the
[13:12.760 --> 13:18.880]  guys in Abu Ghraib you think we'd let Yemeni officials have our terrorists
[13:18.880 --> 13:23.240]  seriously do you really believe that if these are the guys that actually bomb
[13:23.240 --> 13:28.960]  the coal do you think that we would let them be in a Yemeni prison no these are
[13:28.960 --> 13:33.760]  the guys that should be on the so-called waterboarding tables all right these are
[13:33.760 --> 13:37.280]  the guys that you should be extracting information of from but no instead
[13:37.280 --> 13:41.200]  they're gonna be let go will probably be some wild outlandish story about how
[13:41.200 --> 13:46.480]  they helped with the next terror attack the next false flag operation and the
[13:46.480 --> 13:51.560]  dumb public will go along with it just like they went along with the what was
[13:51.560 --> 13:55.440]  it uh-huh is war he there who was killed like three different times there was one
[13:55.440 --> 13:59.000]  time I think you know Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was captured and killed a
[13:59.000 --> 14:03.480]  couple times before you know his official capture and so they put out those
[14:03.480 --> 14:07.600]  you know Mario the plumber pics and you know convicted him of the crimes of
[14:07.600 --> 14:12.120]  9-11 and then didn't show anybody anything and said well you know our
[14:12.120 --> 14:15.760]  interrogations are good enough the public can just believe us and even at
[14:15.760 --> 14:19.000]  that on mainstream news a lot of people were like well you know he was tortured
[14:19.000 --> 14:23.560]  and there's no tape and there was no trial maybe there's something going on
[14:23.560 --> 14:27.520]  here you're damn right there's something going on here and it has nothing to do
[14:27.520 --> 14:34.080]  with terrorism it has everything to do with fear and imposing new modes of
[14:34.080 --> 14:37.520]  control on the American people through eviscerating the Constitution and bill
[14:37.520 --> 14:44.360]  of rights and bringing into existence new agencies such as Homeland Security I
[14:44.360 --> 14:48.400]  know it's not so new anymore folks but we've been acclimated to this thing we've
[14:48.400 --> 14:54.440]  been acclimated to a system of color codes oh no it's orange the threat level
[14:54.440 --> 14:59.240]  is high oh I better lock my doors and not talk to anybody and report
[14:59.240 --> 15:03.120]  suspicious behavior I mean that's what it's come down to and they're talking
[15:03.120 --> 15:07.440]  about having a high school that's gonna indoctrinate people into Homeland
[15:07.440 --> 15:11.320]  Security basically train you to go there and they just recently had this drug
[15:11.320 --> 15:15.160]  bust over at San Diego University I think it was to the San Diego state or
[15:15.160 --> 15:19.720]  San Diego you I'm not sure which one it is and I think they rounded up about a
[15:19.720 --> 15:23.040]  hundred kids and one of the kids that they arrested for selling cocaine and
[15:23.040 --> 15:28.320]  having weapons was of course in the criminal justice program about to head
[15:28.320 --> 15:31.440]  into Homeland Security see these people are criminals too just because you work
[15:31.440 --> 15:36.560]  for a government agency doesn't make it so you're you're above the law or you're
[15:36.560 --> 15:40.080]  not corrupt no most of these people get involved in these agencies so they can
[15:40.080 --> 15:45.400]  be more corrupt so they can take some money off the top it has nothing to do
[15:45.400 --> 15:50.480]  with protecting you and I again the people that supposedly bombed the coal
[15:50.480 --> 15:57.640]  are out of prison they were not the subject of these high-tech camps when
[15:57.640 --> 16:01.880]  Mitt Romney goes out and says oh I think that we should have more prisoners in
[16:01.880 --> 16:08.440]  Abu Ghraib I think it should be bigger I want bigger Gitmo Guantanamo Bay does
[16:08.440 --> 16:12.680]  not do enough well if you're not putting the quote-unquote supposed real
[16:12.680 --> 16:16.480]  terrorists in these bases what are they there for while they're there to you
[16:16.480 --> 16:22.920]  know herd up the the farmers and the sheep herders and you know the regular
[16:22.920 --> 16:28.760]  people and and do experiments on them check out John Ronson's what is it
[16:28.760 --> 16:32.240]  crazy rulers of the world in the second part of that they show how they
[16:32.240 --> 16:36.760]  torture these people by playing a continuous loop of Barney I love you
[16:36.760 --> 16:42.560]  you love me we're a happy family can you imagine having to hear that for 24
[16:42.560 --> 16:47.320]  hours a day for months and years on end while you're tortured while you watch
[16:47.320 --> 16:53.480]  your family get tortured you know we have William Lewis on a little later
[16:53.480 --> 16:56.960]  today and he's recently put out Washington you're fired you get that
[16:56.960 --> 17:01.120]  over at info wars dot com along with American drug war and a host of other
[17:01.120 --> 17:04.120]  great titles but the reason I bring William Lewis into this is because I
[17:04.120 --> 17:08.400]  was skimming through his movie last night and he has some of those pictures
[17:08.400 --> 17:12.400]  from Guantanamo Bay you know they're the famous ones we've all seen with the
[17:12.400 --> 17:16.480]  dogs attacking in the prisoners naked and bloodied but that's not half of it
[17:16.480 --> 17:21.480]  okay the foreign press published pictures of women being raped I bet you
[17:21.480 --> 17:25.640]  didn't know that do a little Google image search take the safe search off just
[17:25.640 --> 17:31.520]  typing in it's real and that's just a small percentage of the things that were
[17:31.520 --> 17:34.680]  leaked out of Abu Ghraib we all think that we've seen it all but if you go
[17:34.680 --> 17:39.120]  back to the news in and around that time there are many senators that got to
[17:39.120 --> 17:43.440]  watch the video tapes and see the classified photographs and they were
[17:43.440 --> 17:47.760]  appalled they were disgusted they barely even disgusted with the media because
[17:47.760 --> 17:54.160]  they could not believe what they had seen and experienced and of course you
[17:54.160 --> 17:59.800]  know Don Rumsfeld and Gonzalez want to blame it on the lower tier they want to
[17:59.800 --> 18:04.840]  get a army colonel in trouble they want to say he orchestrated it well these
[18:04.840 --> 18:09.640]  guys up at the upper echelons they're the ones that ordered it they knew they
[18:09.640 --> 18:13.240]  were torturing people they know what kind of programs they're running they
[18:13.240 --> 18:19.520]  try to have plausible deniability by bringing in CACI forces khaki forces or
[18:19.520 --> 18:24.800]  blackwater types for them to carry out the interrogations but the military
[18:24.800 --> 18:27.920]  knows damn well what they're doing they're in the room too and if you
[18:27.920 --> 18:32.440]  think that they don't jump in you're very mistaken I mean again check it out
[18:32.440 --> 18:35.600]  for yourselves folks go out do the research I'm not asking you to believe
[18:35.600 --> 18:40.320]  anything I'm saying I'm asking you to actually make your mind work you know go
[18:40.320 --> 18:43.720]  out do it do a little research get on the internet you know that that new
[18:43.720 --> 18:49.240]  fandangled thing the kids are talking about type in Abu Ghraib type in
[18:49.240 --> 18:55.040]  photographs type in videotapes literally John Hugh writes memos how they can
[18:55.040 --> 19:00.360]  crush small children's testicles in front of their parents and rape people
[19:00.360 --> 19:04.880]  with battery acid if it's going to stop the next terror attack because we're all
[19:04.880 --> 19:09.240]  worried about terrorism well apparently someone's not worried about terrorism
[19:09.240 --> 19:14.880]  because all the people that killed those sailors at the USS Cole are gone
[19:14.880 --> 19:20.920]  they're gone it's it's so ridiculous hold on two suspects described as the key
[19:20.920 --> 19:25.440]  organizers were captured outside Yemen and are being held at Guantanamo Bay see
[19:25.440 --> 19:29.040]  those are the guys there many details of their alleged involvement remain
[19:29.040 --> 19:34.040]  classified it is unclear when or if they will be tried by the military well if
[19:34.040 --> 19:38.640]  they were guilty they'd be tried in a hurry folks prisonplanet.com will be

[24:29.020 --> 24:34.280]  and uh... that's their excuse for pulling over an unrelated vehicle and

[25:31.700 --> 25:34.520]  it should be obvious by now the police are out of control
[25:34.520 --> 25:38.440]  a parasitical force unleashed on a society at large
[25:38.440 --> 25:42.360]  cops no longer help granny across the street or respond to burglary
[25:42.360 --> 25:44.880]  cops are like the crypts bloods
[25:44.880 --> 25:46.760]  or mara south rusia
[25:46.760 --> 25:48.560]  another violent street game
[25:48.560 --> 25:51.120]  ms-13 another violent street came out like
[25:51.120 --> 25:52.000]  point out that
[25:52.000 --> 25:52.840]  the really
[25:52.840 --> 25:57.320]  kind of reminded me of an ms-13 attack i saw on msnbc
[25:57.320 --> 25:58.820]  but what armed
[25:58.820 --> 26:03.000]  and supported by the state exactly they have guns and uh... the state allows
[26:03.000 --> 26:06.200]  them to pull over and beat up whoever they want
[26:06.200 --> 26:09.920]  a half dozen police officers kicked and beat three men pull from a car during a
[26:09.920 --> 26:13.840]  traffic stop it's more than a half dozen folks watch the video
[26:13.840 --> 26:17.340]  as a t-v helicopter tape the confrontation reports the associated
[26:17.340 --> 26:18.180]  press
[26:18.180 --> 26:23.800]  the video shot by w tx f t v shows three police cars stopped by stopping a car
[26:23.800 --> 26:27.600]  monday two days after a city officer was shot to death responding to a bank
[26:27.600 --> 26:29.180]  robbery
[26:29.180 --> 26:33.360]  in other words after a fellow gang member was shot and killed protecting a bank
[26:33.360 --> 26:37.240]  the largest gang in philadelphia one revenge and blood
[26:37.240 --> 26:39.960]  that's the real job of the cops protect banks
[26:39.960 --> 26:41.560]  not the public at large
[26:41.560 --> 26:44.120]  considered the enemy
[26:44.120 --> 26:47.920]  the tape shows about a dozen officers gathering around the vehicle
[26:47.920 --> 26:52.080]  about a half dozen officers hold two of the men on the ground both are kicked
[26:52.080 --> 26:53.040]  repeatedly
[26:53.040 --> 26:54.960]  while one is seen being punched
[26:54.960 --> 26:56.300]  one also
[26:56.300 --> 26:59.000]  uh... appears to be struck with a baton
[26:59.000 --> 27:01.840]  it doesn't appear to be struck with a baton he's beaten with a baton
[27:01.840 --> 27:03.000]  mercilessly
[27:03.000 --> 27:04.160]  unbelievable
[27:04.160 --> 27:07.560]  on the surface it certainly does not look good in terms of the amount of force
[27:07.560 --> 27:08.480]  that was used
[27:08.480 --> 27:11.240]  said police commissioner charles ramsey
[27:11.240 --> 27:13.240]  but we don't want to rush to judgment
[27:13.240 --> 27:16.200]  now i don't know why rush to judgment
[27:16.200 --> 27:17.920]  the guys didn't run
[27:17.920 --> 27:21.120]  uh... they were pulled over they got out of the car like they were supposed to
[27:21.120 --> 27:23.720]  they got on their stomachs and they were still being
[27:23.720 --> 27:25.280]  ridiculously
[27:25.280 --> 27:27.600]  let's not rush to judgment
[27:27.600 --> 27:31.600]  you know i hate to have to suspend a lot of my good officers who i run corrupt
[27:31.600 --> 27:33.480]  operations with
[27:33.480 --> 27:35.680]  you know how am i supposed to skim this week
[27:35.680 --> 27:38.880]  how am i supposed to take my tail from the local drug dealers this week if i
[27:38.880 --> 27:41.240]  don't have some of my lieutenants
[27:41.240 --> 27:43.440]  were there to collect that money
[27:43.440 --> 27:45.920]  so you know obviously doesn't look good but we'll
[27:45.920 --> 27:49.480]  will brush it under the rug no big deal
[27:49.480 --> 27:51.480]  unreal
[27:51.480 --> 27:54.920]  no of course not even though the video plainly shows there was absolutely no
[27:54.920 --> 27:58.680]  reason for members of the police gang to savagely beat the three hapless
[27:58.680 --> 28:00.120]  uh... people pictured
[28:00.120 --> 28:03.720]  the officers responding to a report of a shooting nearby police said
[28:03.720 --> 28:07.000]  it was not immediately clear what preceded the confrontation what does it
[28:07.000 --> 28:08.560]  matter
[28:08.560 --> 28:12.880]  unless these guys had a gun and they were firing at the officers or they were
[28:12.880 --> 28:14.440]  you know
[28:14.440 --> 28:18.040]  again you know the copter seems like it was following for a while
[28:18.040 --> 28:19.800]  if they were running red lights
[28:19.800 --> 28:24.080]  they were doing something out of shocking videos on uh... spike
[28:24.080 --> 28:25.360]  maybe
[28:25.360 --> 28:29.040]  some of that force would have been necessary but i didn't see any resistance
[28:29.040 --> 28:32.400]  whatsoever on the video
[28:32.400 --> 28:34.560]  we don't like to take into
[28:34.560 --> 28:37.120]  or i'm sorry we don't take into consideration the emotions of the
[28:37.120 --> 28:41.520]  police officers when it comes to the discharge of their duties
[28:41.520 --> 28:46.200]  your emotional state being tired doesn't justify what's on the video
[28:46.200 --> 28:51.080]  said uh... d scott perine an attorney who represents the three men in the in
[28:51.080 --> 28:54.360]  the video yeah he should represent them and he's dead on
[28:54.360 --> 28:57.480]  he said one of the clients suffered a wealth on his head the size of a
[28:57.480 --> 29:00.320]  baseball and one of his legs was seriously injured
[29:00.320 --> 29:03.760]  he didn't know the extent of any of the injuries of the other two men
[29:03.760 --> 29:07.040]  it clearly shows a lack of any reasonable investigation before these
[29:07.040 --> 29:11.000]  police yank these individuals out of the car and take turns delivering blows
[29:11.000 --> 29:12.160]  he said
[29:12.160 --> 29:16.560]  this is a time for a thorough investigation to see what is what it is
[29:16.560 --> 29:18.360]  that happened here
[29:18.360 --> 29:21.560]  alright bob Chapman coming up with some financial news on the other side we're

[34:23.000 --> 34:27.080]  all right folks we are back
[34:28.360 --> 34:33.320]  it's the alex joneshow i'm jason bermas filling in and we have bob Chapman of the
[34:33.320 --> 34:38.360]  international forecaster with us the man uh spent three years in us army counter
[34:38.360 --> 34:43.080]  intelligence he was also one of the largest gold and silver stock brokers in the world
[34:43.080 --> 34:48.600]  for almost 30 years and uh of course owns and edits the uh international forecaster
[34:48.600 --> 34:55.080]  mr bob Chapman how are you sir fine thank you and you left one thing out what did i leave out
[34:55.640 --> 35:04.040]  i'm old you're not that old yet you're a uh a young 72 and you keep trucking along i
[35:04.040 --> 35:09.560]  hear you on this program quite a bit uh warning people about the uh really the huge financial
[35:09.560 --> 35:15.080]  crisis in this country right now i mean yesterday alex brought up a story uh where they want 200
[35:15.080 --> 35:20.760]  dollar a barrel oil i think we're almost up to uh almost up to like 125 right now and that's
[35:20.760 --> 35:26.200]  really going to hurt the economy especially with our fiat currency that just continues to lose value
[35:26.200 --> 35:35.960]  bob yeah you're absolutely right uh oil is 121 77 right now and it's off 65 cents today but it's
[35:35.960 --> 35:44.840]  past 120 and it traded up to i guess 124 yesterday and the report you're referring to is by the
[35:44.840 --> 35:51.800]  analyst at goldman sacks which is an investment banking house in new york city and they seem to
[35:51.800 --> 36:00.760]  think that in the next six months to two years that oil could go to 150 to 200 dollars a barrel
[36:01.400 --> 36:05.800]  and uh i guess that's pretty possible uh we have the international forecaster
[36:05.800 --> 36:14.120]  about eight or nine months ago said the oil was going to 120 and i remember it distinctly because uh
[36:14.760 --> 36:20.920]  a t-bone pick and said it was going to go down and he changed his mind about a week and a half later
[36:20.920 --> 36:31.880]  but anyway um uh goldman sacks is not factoring in any other uh military actions are occupations
[36:31.880 --> 36:40.040]  either and i would think that uh if the people in the white house decided that it was finally time
[36:40.040 --> 36:49.480]  for them to attack aran or kosovo or georgia and get involved in any of those places and maybe some
[36:49.480 --> 36:58.760]  others that oil could go even higher and so we got a combination of higher oil and gas and
[36:58.760 --> 37:07.320]  and distillate prices uh we have higher food prices we have a dollar that's spreading inflation all
[37:07.320 --> 37:13.320]  over the world and falling in value nominally every time they try to get the dollar up it comes
[37:13.320 --> 37:19.480]  right back down again and uh that's understandable because people want to get out of the dollar
[37:20.040 --> 37:24.840]  because they're losing money on it and they want to either get into another currency that
[37:24.840 --> 37:31.880]  isn't losing as much money or into golden silver where they should be yeah absolutely they should
[37:31.880 --> 37:36.520]  be into a hard currency that's going to retain its value uh throughout history i mean gold and
[37:36.520 --> 37:41.720]  silver have always been worth something and you just mentioned the invasion of iran well to me
[37:41.720 --> 37:47.080]  it's not a shocker uh it's simple supply and demand that when we took over iraq which was the second
[37:47.080 --> 37:51.720]  largest oil rich nation in the world um you know demand for oil was still the same but since we
[37:51.720 --> 37:57.880]  controlled the supply we demanded more money and you know that's why we have this rise in gas prices
[37:57.880 --> 38:03.560]  over the last you know four five years now is because we control more of it and if we if we go
[38:03.560 --> 38:08.040]  into iran and we take their oil fields as well i feel like we're going to be paying six dollars a
[38:08.040 --> 38:14.440]  gallon of gas oh i think you're right and there's many people throughout the world uh who are playing
[38:15.800 --> 38:21.320]  well if you live in nicorago it's four seventy uh if you live in london or in europe
[38:21.320 --> 38:26.520]  it's around nine dollars and diesels over ten and it's probably a little bit higher now those
[38:26.520 --> 38:33.160]  figures a couple of weeks old and so um americans really haven't caught up because they're uh they
[38:33.160 --> 38:39.960]  don't have as much taxation on energy products as other countries have put upon them and so
[38:40.520 --> 38:48.040]  uh without any increase in taxes in america um i think um we could see an average price
[38:48.040 --> 38:53.880]  of somewhere between this is average now between four fifty and five dollars a gallon during the
[38:53.880 --> 39:01.800]  summer and uh that's because that's the a big period during the year when more gasoline is used
[39:01.800 --> 39:10.760]  than uh and other parts of the year and also uh refineries are only operating at approximately
[39:10.760 --> 39:18.440]  eighty seven percent of capacity and so that makes uh the price go up as well so we could be looking
[39:18.440 --> 39:25.960]  at five dollars in lots of cities i mean there are cities now that are over four and so um if we
[39:25.960 --> 39:32.680]  look at one fifty to two hundred dollar oil uh we'll be looking at um eight or nine or ten
[39:32.680 --> 39:38.040]  dollars a gallon and of course that spreads throughout the entire economy most people don't
[39:38.040 --> 39:44.280]  stop and think beyond the gas pump but uh we we do buy distillates to heat our homes in the winter
[39:44.280 --> 39:54.120]  in the north and the northeast and also uh the about seventy percent of petroleum is used for
[39:54.120 --> 40:01.560]  byproducts and so all of those byproducts are going to go up in cost as well and if you join
[40:01.560 --> 40:08.840]  that with the problem that we have with food prices uh there's going to be a lot of people in the
[40:08.840 --> 40:14.440]  world who are going to starve to death yeah and you know a lot of people don't even realize that
[40:14.440 --> 40:18.520]  even though it's just you know it's not just the gas going up to five or six dollars a gallon
[40:18.520 --> 40:22.920]  everything shipped you know around the country in trucks in fact uh the truckers had a big strike
[40:22.920 --> 40:28.040]  in dc the mainstream media ignored it last week but these guys are sick of paying you know an
[40:28.040 --> 40:32.280]  outlandish amount for gas because it's cutting into their profits as well and they're not getting
[40:32.280 --> 40:37.640]  paid anymore you know the inflation keeps happening their paycheck is worth less and less
[40:37.640 --> 40:43.800]  and we end up paying uh more for it at you know the grocery store or the pizza shop or the burger
[40:43.800 --> 40:51.160]  shop because it it costs more money to get the supplies across the country well they're absolutely
[40:51.160 --> 41:01.720]  right and um uh if if the truckers went out for one week uh every supermarket in the country would
[41:01.720 --> 41:09.560]  be empty and i think finally they might get the message you know we know that this is a scam
[41:10.680 --> 41:16.760]  anybody who who is on the inside knows and the public believes it's a scam as well
[41:16.760 --> 41:24.040]  although they don't have the hard facts and uh of course uh the truck drivers can't make any money
[41:24.040 --> 41:33.800]  at all uh having to pay so much more uh for their propellant so to speak and uh and so it it it's a
[41:33.800 --> 41:41.960]  very very bad situation and it's not going to get better anytime soon it um uh and and if we get
[41:41.960 --> 41:49.320]  rid of uh the use of ethanol which is one of the major problems in higher food prices
[41:50.280 --> 41:57.720]  then that means that america would have to purchase more oil but i i don't know what the offset would
[41:57.720 --> 42:08.200]  be between ethanol uh the stopping of ethanol production and the stopping of the continued
[42:08.200 --> 42:15.240]  filling of the strategic petroleum reserve by the white house something to think about
[42:16.120 --> 42:19.880]  so so what do you think are some of the solutions that we should be telling people about what what
[42:19.880 --> 42:26.360]  should people be doing to protect themselves from this this sort of thing well with the um
[42:26.360 --> 42:32.520]  energy products there's not much it can do at all except uh hope for the best because it's it's
[42:32.520 --> 42:39.400]  at a level that most people can't reach i mean they can't go on the on the floor of the uh different
[42:39.400 --> 42:50.040]  exchanges that do that and uh make any impact with food i think they can uh and that problem is
[42:50.920 --> 42:58.040]  basically two full yes you have weather and sometimes it's not very good but we could stop
[42:58.040 --> 43:03.560]  ethanol production in the united states and in europe and that would go a long way uh to
[43:03.560 --> 43:13.160]  attempt helping the situation and also we could change the uh agreements we've made through
[43:13.160 --> 43:21.960]  NAFTA and CAFTA uh on production uh in the united states the 70 percent of the farming in america
[43:21.960 --> 43:30.440]  is done by corporations large uh corporations owned by rich people and they are subsidized
[43:31.480 --> 43:41.480]  and if that subsidy would be lifted then american products from the earth would cost
[43:41.480 --> 43:49.400]  relatively the same we'll assume as they would in central or south america and mexico
[43:49.400 --> 43:54.840]  so and that would mean that farmers would go back to the land again because what happened
[43:55.640 --> 44:07.880]  was that if they were producing corn previously prior to NAFTA at 350 a bushel and subsidized
[44:07.880 --> 44:13.640]  corn in the united states with three dollars a bushel well they just couldn't compete and that's
[44:13.640 --> 44:22.600]  why we had this tremendous upsurge of illegal aliens in the united states from mexico uh during
[44:22.600 --> 44:27.960]  the period between 1995 and present because the people were driven off the land because it couldn't
[44:27.960 --> 44:34.760]  compete anymore because the ritual being subsidized in the united states and they still are well i feel
[44:34.760 --> 44:38.760]  like that you know CAFTA and NAFTA the central american free trade agreement the north american
[44:38.760 --> 44:43.960]  free trade agreement it is there to do just that to push illegal immigrants into this country so
[44:43.960 --> 44:50.440]  they can try to find a better life and really to create this north american union between us
[44:50.440 --> 44:54.600]  canada and mexico and that's why you're seeing you know the trans texas corridor being built
[44:54.600 --> 44:59.480]  that's why we had uh the securities and prosperity's partnership kept very hush hush until judicial
[44:59.480 --> 45:04.520]  watch got the papers is because they do want something like the european peon union here
[45:04.520 --> 45:08.760]  and it looks like they're there at the same time trying to kill the dollar so that we can have some
[45:08.760 --> 45:15.880]  sort of an amaro well your thinking is correct and and that is the direction that they are going
[45:16.440 --> 45:23.560]  and uh at least for the time being we've cut them off at the past and uh yes they're working behind
[45:23.560 --> 45:30.200]  the seams and they're using what they call harmonization trying to make the laws similar
[45:30.200 --> 45:35.080]  so they can go to congress five or ten years from now say hey we got everything all set up
[45:35.640 --> 45:41.000]  and what we're going to do now is uh have a and they'll change the name of course
[45:41.720 --> 45:47.240]  a north american union and uh we're going to meld these three countries together but
[45:48.040 --> 45:52.280]  what they've done has been exposed yes they're going ahead on their highway
[45:52.920 --> 45:57.560]  but that doesn't mean it's going to be used they're going to have a long hard fight on this one
[45:57.560 --> 46:04.360]  and people are very very upset and not so much in the united states but in canada in particular
[46:04.920 --> 46:10.040]  the canadians are wild about it and the mexicans quite frankly don't know anything about it
[46:11.400 --> 46:15.320]  no that seems to be the case i mean when you saw uh i don't know if you saw
[46:15.320 --> 46:20.120]  luke radowski of we are changes conversation with viscente fox the uh former president of
[46:20.120 --> 46:25.720]  mexico but he discussed spp at length with him and viscente fox kind of sought him out after
[46:25.720 --> 46:30.040]  his speech to talk to him about it and luke was well look at this trans texas corridor and he's
[46:30.040 --> 46:34.600]  like well that's not being built by the government that's a private corporation he's like yeah it's
[46:34.600 --> 46:40.760]  centra corp it's uh juliani's corporation and although it's privatized it's going to be a road
[46:40.760 --> 46:45.720]  that guts through the country and that mexico is going to use for trade and all viscente fox said
[46:45.720 --> 46:50.200]  well you're right but it's not moving at the pace i'd like to see it he wants to see uh you know
[46:50.200 --> 46:56.440]  this this globalist process go quicker you know he's not satisfied that it's not going fast enough
[46:56.440 --> 47:00.680]  and i'm not satisfied that it's happening at all i'm pretty upset about the fact
[47:00.680 --> 47:05.000]  that they're trying to do this yeah i think they're five to ten years away
[47:06.040 --> 47:10.200]  and uh you know i've been at this from was fifty years so you gain a little patience
[47:11.160 --> 47:18.200]  and uh things have gone rocky for them and i i don't think uh international financial upheaval
[47:18.200 --> 47:24.360]  is going to help them i think it's going to hinder them uh because it's going to bring what they're
[47:24.360 --> 47:30.520]  doing uh more into a questionable atmosphere uh they're going to be asked well why did you do
[47:30.520 --> 47:37.240]  this and why did you do that and why are you doing all these things secretly uh we'll talk about the
[47:37.240 --> 47:45.720]  fed as an example uh a bank's come to the fed's a discount window and at that window they can
[47:45.720 --> 47:52.360]  borrow money at two and a quarter percent but the fed won't let anybody know who the borrowers are
[47:52.920 --> 47:58.760]  the excuse is well there might be a run in one of the banks because people think that the bank
[47:58.760 --> 48:08.600]  might be close to insolvency well quite frankly in part that's true but we shouldn't have secret
[48:08.600 --> 48:18.920]  organizations that are appendages of government doing such things uh this last week uh an answer
[48:18.920 --> 48:30.440]  to a letter by senator dawg to the chairman of the uh of the uh fed reserve uh ben bernanke
[48:30.440 --> 48:39.000]  uh mr benanke was asked to bail out the student loan program and he said uh no i can't do that
[48:39.000 --> 48:46.040]  except the congress and the bush administration to address the diminishing profits on loans and
[48:47.000 --> 48:55.560]  the state of that industry and that was last friday and so when they came through with the
[48:55.560 --> 49:05.160]  new rules for increasing the amount of money at their buy a weekly or twice a month auctions
[49:06.280 --> 49:12.600]  uh they increased them from fifty to seventy five billion twice a month in other words from
[49:12.600 --> 49:19.480]  a hundred to a hundred and fifty billion a month just in the oxygen auctions alone they included
[49:19.480 --> 49:29.880]  it lines of credit to the european central bank and the swiss national bank and what went unnoticed
[49:30.520 --> 49:35.720]  and now this is something that had to have been in the weeks in the in the works for weeks
[49:35.720 --> 49:50.760]  was that uh uh the fed took action uh using uh that artifice uh to help this loan industry
[49:51.800 --> 50:00.360]  and uh and and so he says one thing and does another and this is the kind of thing
[50:00.360 --> 50:10.040]  that calls into question the veracity of mr benanke and and you know to put it all straight up
[50:10.760 --> 50:15.960]  they're all lying i mean nobody in washington a wall street tells the truth and incidentally i
[50:15.960 --> 50:23.720]  spent 28 years in wall street and uh they do have a hard time finding the truth i was not
[50:23.720 --> 50:30.520]  very popular while i was there and it was a long time to all right to get treated like a piranha

[55:19.800 --> 55:23.960]  three weeks working on my project fabled enemies and uh robson in the background
[55:23.960 --> 55:29.400]  doing this 9 11 chronicles flick and it shows that you know we do have an immense amount of power
[55:29.400 --> 55:35.400]  if we put our minds to it each individual holds holds enough power that they can make a difference
[55:35.400 --> 55:39.960]  they can make a change in so many people have have come around and said you can't you know change
[55:39.960 --> 55:44.360]  this and you can't do anything about it and this is just the way it is now that's not the way it is
[55:44.360 --> 55:48.920]  okay if we're going to create change in this country we have to be willing to get out on the
[55:48.920 --> 55:53.400]  streets and do so we have to be willing to inform our neighbors our friends and our families about
[55:53.400 --> 55:59.720]  not only you know 9 11 but the economic crisis we're in you know the fact that they're trying to
[55:59.720 --> 56:06.840]  gouge us in in the in oil pricing and they're trying to basically ruin our economy by devaluing
[56:06.840 --> 56:12.120]  devaluing the dollar and bringing in a new currency and uh really one of the only ways
[56:12.120 --> 56:17.080]  that you're going to be able to you know save money actual real money hard money is to get
[56:17.080 --> 56:23.080]  into uh gold and silver isn't that right bob well it certainly is the best thing i can think of
[56:24.040 --> 56:31.160]  and uh i thought that way for some time and you know uh when you have gold in particular
[56:31.160 --> 56:37.480]  at it doesn't owe anybody anything and it's really pure money has been for centuries
[56:37.480 --> 56:46.440]  and and so uh when times are either inflationary or deflationary uh gold is a good place to be
[56:47.000 --> 56:53.880]  and of course taking possession of gold coin uh is important during those kinds of times silver
[56:53.880 --> 56:59.800]  is a little bit different because it's more commercial metal although uh production for years
[56:59.800 --> 57:09.320]  has been uh shorter than demand and that's going to get even worse as time goes by uh but it has
[57:10.200 --> 57:21.640]  an inflation bent success price wise as opposed to gold also being able to do the same thing
[57:21.640 --> 57:27.880]  in other words go up when inflation is high but also to hold its value when inflation doesn't exist
[57:27.880 --> 57:35.560]  in this deflation so gold is very very unique in that way well i remember you know back in 2003 2004
[57:35.560 --> 57:41.160]  when i first started listening to this very radio show on the reg and you could get gold for under
[57:41.160 --> 57:49.240]  300 an ounce it was like 260 270 and now what's it at about 930 something like that right uh
[57:49.240 --> 57:55.560]  it um it came off a little bit today had a good day yesterday but uh uh just before the program
[57:55.560 --> 58:03.400]  went on we were at 867 40 well i can't i can't imagine anything else out there that has tripled
[58:03.400 --> 58:07.880]  in value in the last five years bob uh we're going to come back right on the other side in
[58:07.880 --> 58:12.840]  the top of the hour with bob Chapman of the international forecaster dot com and we're

[1:00:07.080 --> 1:00:16.440]  and now live from austin texas alex jones all right folks we are back at the alex joneshow
[1:00:16.440 --> 1:00:21.880]  we are with bob Chapman of the international forecaster dot com we're talking golden silver
[1:00:22.520 --> 1:00:28.840]  and and bob can can we really name anything else that is as tripled in value in five years i'm
[1:00:28.840 --> 1:00:33.720]  thinking maybe oil stocks have you know if you got in before the invasion of iraq in the oil
[1:00:33.720 --> 1:00:37.560]  business maybe you made you know triple your money but other than that is there anything else out
[1:00:37.560 --> 1:00:45.000]  there that even compares yeah we recommended uh... uh... oil and uh... oil and gas as well as uh...
[1:00:45.720 --> 1:00:51.800]  as the natural gas uh... usually to people who trade and we uh... recommended three
[1:00:52.760 --> 1:00:58.920]  uh... good oil companies that have done extraordinarily well as well as gold and silver
[1:00:58.920 --> 1:01:07.640]  have and uh... we recommended uh... the swiss uh... frank and the form of swiss frank government
[1:01:07.640 --> 1:01:15.320]  bonds uh... we started to recommend that when the and this is this is about uh... eight years
[1:01:15.320 --> 1:01:22.760]  ago uh... recommending the swiss frank at one seventy three uh... the swiss frank is trading right
[1:01:22.760 --> 1:01:30.440]  now uh... at uh... ninety four fifty and uh... so that's been quite a change
[1:01:31.320 --> 1:01:35.800]  and uh... for those who bought swiss frank government bonds and kept on rolling them
[1:01:36.520 --> 1:01:44.920]  uh... they got a small uh... dividend interest payment of usually around
[1:01:45.720 --> 1:01:51.000]  uh... anywhere between one point eight three percent but they've held a value of their currency
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:58.680]  and so it it's been uh... some of the country currencies be beside the swiss frank which i
[1:01:58.680 --> 1:02:05.800]  happen to like the best and uh... i've lived in bankton and uh... and done business in europe for
[1:02:05.800 --> 1:02:11.480]  many years uh... sometime ago so i'm very familiar with uh... the markets over there in fact i went
[1:02:11.480 --> 1:02:21.560]  to school in switzerland and uh... anyway uh... so you get swiss frank uh... oriented assets for
[1:02:21.560 --> 1:02:26.120]  those who want to have liquidity you might have a business you don't want to keep your money
[1:02:26.840 --> 1:02:34.360]  in a savings account or checking account or in u.s. treasuries because of the very reasons i've just
[1:02:34.360 --> 1:02:39.000]  pointed out so you buy swiss frank government bonds you can buy them today and sell them tomorrow
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:46.360]  if you want and the commissions are ridiculously low the virtually nothing uh... more an accommodation
[1:02:46.360 --> 1:02:53.000]  to a broker chest client and uh... and then you've got the gold and silver related assets and
[1:02:53.640 --> 1:02:59.160]  other than that uh... i i think is a form of insurance uh... you want to have
[1:03:00.040 --> 1:03:06.040]  uh... free stride and dehydrated foods uh... method of purifying water and a method of
[1:03:06.040 --> 1:03:12.680]  defending your family yeah absolutely so you're the international forecaster
[1:03:12.680 --> 1:03:18.040]  what's coming in the next six months well we're going to see higher gold and silver prices
[1:03:19.320 --> 1:03:26.600]  and uh... i wouldn't be surprised if we'll use gold as the guideline uh... that by the end of the
[1:03:26.600 --> 1:03:33.640]  year we could see twelve maybe twelve hundred dollars maybe even higher uh... you gotta remember
[1:03:33.640 --> 1:03:40.040]  the government uh... the central banks uh... the western governments are working in concert
[1:03:40.920 --> 1:03:46.920]  to suppress the price uh... if they weren't doing that and hadn't been doing that since 1988
[1:03:47.640 --> 1:03:54.120]  a goal would probably be selling now somewhere between uh... twenty two hundred and three
[1:03:54.120 --> 1:04:01.960]  thousand dollars an ounce so uh... they've only got so much gold and there's only so much they can
[1:04:01.960 --> 1:04:11.720]  sell that's the central banks and governments and once that's gone it's gone and for all intents
[1:04:11.720 --> 1:04:17.240]  and purposes there's no real inventory in governmental hands of silver there may be
[1:04:17.960 --> 1:04:25.560]  in corporations or for individuals but there's no great overhang near either and so the upside
[1:04:25.560 --> 1:04:31.800]  looks very very good for the next two to three years gotcha we're going to be taking calls uh...
[1:04:31.800 --> 1:04:35.560]  with bob Chapman on the other side until about uh... twelve thirty so if you want to call into the

[1:08:11.480 --> 1:08:21.320]  all right ladies and gentlemen it is the alex jones show i am jason bermas subbing in for the
[1:08:21.320 --> 1:08:27.080]  next few days and i'm with bob chapman of the international forecaster dot com and we're
[1:08:27.080 --> 1:08:32.600]  going to go to your calls now hopefully we have comments or questions for mr chapman
[1:08:32.600 --> 1:08:36.760]  let's take the first caller let's take john in north carolina john are you with us
[1:08:36.760 --> 1:08:44.600]  yes i'm with you what's your question i've been noticing i've been taking photographs and
[1:08:44.600 --> 1:08:52.440]  with my video camera cd and you know i've been noticing these cam trails and i have pictures
[1:08:52.440 --> 1:09:00.360]  and video of these jets they look like military jets the big ones c 132s and they're up there
[1:09:00.360 --> 1:09:06.200]  and you see these big emotions of dispersion of these white exhaust fumes on the back and on the
[1:09:06.200 --> 1:09:12.600]  other side about super i'm in a in a major traffic area woman to north carolina before it's the last
[1:09:12.600 --> 1:09:19.000]  point before they leave the coastal region okay now there's others that are at the same altitude
[1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:25.320]  like you know maybe 15 minutes 10 five minutes later and they're not emitting the same exhaust
[1:09:25.880 --> 1:09:33.720]  same feet in the air no exhaust well here's the deal i question is you go on i mean all right
[1:09:33.720 --> 1:09:37.560]  all right let me tell you what's going on um basically chemtrails are real there are the
[1:09:37.560 --> 1:09:43.160]  ones that do chemtrails like you said they emit uh you know this long cloud that kind of disperses
[1:09:43.160 --> 1:09:47.720]  out they do cross hatch patterns and then there's other ones that do uh com trails that have been
[1:09:47.720 --> 1:09:53.320]  around forever where you just see this mist and then it dissolves now the official line on what
[1:09:53.320 --> 1:09:57.480]  chemtrails are can now be found in uh weather modification they're saying it's there to fight
[1:09:57.480 --> 1:10:03.000]  global warming there's a few mainstream articles on it before it didn't exist and then the uh
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:08.600]  believe it was the california mainstream media the nbc station over there started doing a story
[1:10:08.600 --> 1:10:13.800]  on it they said well you know we're catching these on uh video they obviously exist and this woman
[1:10:13.800 --> 1:10:18.440]  has been collecting samples over the last 10 years at her lake when these things were going on and they
[1:10:18.440 --> 1:10:23.240]  said there was aluminum oxide and other heavy metals in there and it had all the earmarks
[1:10:23.240 --> 1:10:29.400]  of weather control now again the mainstream line is that this is there to uh fight global warming
[1:10:29.400 --> 1:10:34.200]  and uh you know that's about all i know i don't buy into it god knows why they're actually spraying
[1:10:34.200 --> 1:10:39.400]  us but chemtrails are obviously real uh you can see them there's a couple documentaries out there
[1:10:39.400 --> 1:10:43.800]  on google video you can check out you know as to speculate to what they are but that's all i know
[1:10:43.800 --> 1:10:48.280]  i thank you for the call john uh let's move forward to hopefully someone who has something to say to
[1:10:48.280 --> 1:10:54.360]  bob uh charles and louisiana charles are you with me hey yes sir how you doing sir good man i've heard
[1:10:54.360 --> 1:11:00.360]  you many times on the alex johnson i want to thank you uh for hosting today mr chappan
[1:11:00.360 --> 1:11:07.160]  but uh uh the i've been in this for years and i quit blaming the government for what's happened to
[1:11:07.160 --> 1:11:13.720]  america i quit blaming the woman i think it's the coward america that the tremor would fear
[1:11:13.720 --> 1:11:19.480]  like the police are just beating us up and all that they can't do that if you're a man they only
[1:11:19.480 --> 1:11:25.480]  could do this to cowards when will american people or what will it take mr chappan and will it take
[1:11:25.480 --> 1:11:31.720]  starvation will it take maybe killing the kids or whatever when will american people say enough
[1:11:31.720 --> 1:11:39.720]  is enough so yeah well that's that that's hard to say but uh i think it's sufficient in america
[1:11:40.360 --> 1:11:48.120]  uh to have a depression and uh a good many of people are losing their homes their jobs their cars
[1:11:48.120 --> 1:11:54.280]  uh living under a bridge or whatever uh i think that will be the catalyst that'll get it going
[1:11:54.280 --> 1:12:01.640]  because uh the world lives on its stomach and of course the transportation to bring the food to
[1:12:01.640 --> 1:12:08.520]  you so that you can exist and so i i think that that will be the cataclysmic event and i think
[1:12:08.520 --> 1:12:13.640]  the people behind government realize that quite well well charles i would just say this you know
[1:12:13.640 --> 1:12:18.200]  i remember saying that same thing to my family and friends and being like when's enough going to be
[1:12:18.200 --> 1:12:22.760]  enough and they're this is back in the days of you know gas being under two dollars and it was
[1:12:22.760 --> 1:12:27.000]  just starting to go up and they're like well we'll never pay three dollars a gallon and they
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:30.760]  started paying three dollars a gallon we'll never pay four dollars a gallon now we're paying four
[1:12:30.760 --> 1:12:35.160]  dollars a gallon we're soon to be paying five dollars a gallon if that doesn't get the general
[1:12:35.160 --> 1:12:40.360]  population in an uproar i really just don't know what's going to do that other than what mr
[1:12:40.360 --> 1:12:45.880]  what mr chapman said which is like bread lines you know a return to you know the the crash of 29
[1:12:46.680 --> 1:12:51.000]  god knows i mean we have to put it up upon ourselves but at the same time you know we
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:55.640]  have to be active and out there and talking to family and friends about these situations
[1:12:55.640 --> 1:13:00.120]  and not letting up you know we have to bombard other people with other information otherwise
[1:13:00.120 --> 1:13:03.080]  you know we are going to have to suffer through depression and who knows if we make it out of
[1:13:03.080 --> 1:13:09.000]  there i thank you for the call charles um let's go to uh dave in texas dave are you with us
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:12.840]  yeah how are you doing good today um i have a couple of comments for your
[1:13:12.840 --> 1:13:19.720]  uh guest respond to if i might sure um i've kind of noticed something of um on picked up on some
[1:13:19.720 --> 1:13:24.840]  other patriot radio programming that some people having any due problems with their banks their
[1:13:24.840 --> 1:13:29.640]  they have like obviously excess fees and the kind of unfair and abrupt treatment they often get
[1:13:29.640 --> 1:13:35.960]  from tellers and the seeming unfair commercial practices of banks uh the interest rates on certain
[1:13:35.960 --> 1:13:40.920]  types of loans and various other things and i myself have been doing business for about 10
[1:13:40.920 --> 1:13:46.760]  years now with a credit union i currently don't do business with a bank uh just my personal uh use
[1:13:46.760 --> 1:13:51.240]  and i was not noticing that it's easier for many people to get into credit unions now than it used
[1:13:51.240 --> 1:13:56.440]  to be and i would recommend a lot of people having trouble with banks and feeling they're being shafted
[1:13:56.440 --> 1:14:04.600]  so to speak in various ways consider if they can arrange to transfer over to a credit union
[1:14:04.600 --> 1:14:07.800]  that they consider doing that they'll usually get better treatment less fees i haven't had any
[1:14:07.800 --> 1:14:12.280]  undue fees since i've been there i use their atm i don't get charged anything they don't charge me
[1:14:12.280 --> 1:14:16.440]  to see a teller and some of the other uh ridiculous things you get at some banks and they've never
[1:14:16.440 --> 1:14:21.400]  messed with my accounts or taken monies out or things you know i've never bounced checks when
[1:14:21.400 --> 1:14:25.800]  i knew i had funds cover them had various things i don't currently have any credit cards that's
[1:14:25.800 --> 1:14:30.520]  another thing i'd recommend people get off of credit cards try to get off debt if they're currently
[1:14:30.520 --> 1:14:35.000]  debt free stay try to stay out of debt if they have debt they can pay off pay it down and the other
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:40.200]  quick comment was for people to try and stock up on on the food issue on storeable non-perishable
[1:14:40.200 --> 1:14:44.120]  food items that they could use in addition to the things like gold and silver if they can get into that
[1:14:44.120 --> 1:14:50.280]  too especially coins to try and prep for themselves for coming hard times if they can build up food
[1:14:50.280 --> 1:14:54.840]  supplies storeable foods and storeable capacity for purifying water and things of that nature
[1:14:54.840 --> 1:15:00.840]  that's kind of a preparation technique for people about what do you think about all that i think
[1:15:00.840 --> 1:15:08.360]  he's absolutely correct it's not much i can add to it uh he he's right and uh i just think people
[1:15:08.360 --> 1:15:15.720]  should keep uh perhaps a small amount of cash in and in the small bills at home in their safe
[1:15:16.920 --> 1:15:21.000]  because i think there's going to be a lot of banks over the next two to three years that are
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:25.720]  going to go under maybe a hundred and fifty to three hundred of them and that's why they call back
[1:15:25.720 --> 1:15:34.280]  in thirty five people to the um uh fdic to be able to handle this increase uh they know what's
[1:15:34.280 --> 1:15:40.040]  coming certain banks will be saved certain banks will not be and the alumina's banks are the ones
[1:15:40.040 --> 1:15:46.120]  that will be saved they'll be able to get the credit and uh and so people shouldn't keep a large
[1:15:46.120 --> 1:15:52.200]  amount of money in either a credit union or a bank uh they should either have it in golden
[1:15:52.200 --> 1:15:59.880]  silver related assets or as i mentioned earlier in swiss frank government bonds and um but generally
[1:15:59.880 --> 1:16:04.520]  speaking when he says is absolutely correct and i mentioned some of the things early on in the program
[1:16:05.320 --> 1:16:08.920]  dave thank you for the call i i have a little question to add on to that he mentioned that if
[1:16:08.920 --> 1:16:14.760]  you have debt uh you should pay it off immediately if you can now i'm a guy with some student loans
[1:16:14.760 --> 1:16:21.400]  not too much but you know about ten grand in debt should i if i if i get the opportunity pay that
[1:16:21.400 --> 1:16:27.880]  off all at once or should i pay it off incrementally and wait for the economy to crash uh i would pay
[1:16:27.880 --> 1:16:34.760]  it off incrementally and use the money that you would use to pay off that to buy gold and silver
[1:16:34.760 --> 1:16:39.880]  coins yeah because that's going to retain value and they will go off and value and you'll be able
[1:16:39.880 --> 1:16:45.880]  to pay it off more cheaply yeah it's not a bad call you know i've i've uh and and that goes for
[1:16:45.880 --> 1:16:52.600]  other other things too like people say well gee uh the kids are growing up they've gone
[1:16:52.600 --> 1:16:58.600]  i've got these insurance policies uh i figured it's going to cost ten thousand dollars to bury me
[1:16:58.600 --> 1:17:06.680]  and uh i've got two hundred thousand dollars worth of insurance uh cash it out buy gold and silver
[1:17:06.680 --> 1:17:11.560]  related assets uh swiss franc government bonds along with it make sure you have all of that
[1:17:11.560 --> 1:17:22.280]  insurance at home for the members of your family like the food and the uh defensive items and uh
[1:17:22.280 --> 1:17:29.960]  how to uh terrify water and things like that and you know after a certain period of time you don't
[1:17:29.960 --> 1:17:36.440]  need certain things uh people are buried in 401k's a lot of them should be you know if you
[1:17:36.440 --> 1:17:41.640]  can't invest in what you want to and most of them don't allow you to you should cash them out
[1:17:42.680 --> 1:17:48.280]  particularly if you're over 59 and a half all right well let's go to another caller let's go
[1:17:48.280 --> 1:17:56.440]  to uh joe and wisconsin joey with us hey jason i'm coming for bob i was talking to a professor
[1:17:56.440 --> 1:18:03.240]  of political geography and she was talking to me about uh carrying capacity the earth and this gets
[1:18:03.240 --> 1:18:10.920]  into its big plans but uh basically what they're trying to engineer is a society in retrograde
[1:18:10.920 --> 1:18:16.440]  and everybody pretty much figured out that all bureaucracies insist that you just give up and
[1:18:16.440 --> 1:18:23.560]  quit but only the people who are persistent will ever have success and what they're trying to do
[1:18:23.560 --> 1:18:32.520]  is engineer society to reduce population like everybody talks about to the 1600 levels and
[1:18:32.520 --> 1:18:40.520]  i liken it to a ship sinking and warn the people to get to a lifeboat and you get in one too i mean
[1:18:40.520 --> 1:18:46.680]  the foolish will perish i mean we can't do anything for them i mean morning everybody listen to bob

[1:34:39.480 --> 1:34:44.360]  on i've watched him many a time on the internet i've seen him on c-span several times his name
[1:34:44.360 --> 1:34:50.280]  is peter dale scott he's a former uc berkeley professor and author uh the author of things
[1:34:50.280 --> 1:34:56.680]  like the war conspiracy uh iran contra connection uh deep politics and the death of jfk and his
[1:34:56.680 --> 1:35:02.840]  latest uh the roads 9 11 wealth empire and the future of america peter thanks for being on
[1:35:03.320 --> 1:35:08.920]  that was a pleasure and honor to be on this show well sir i would just say it is a pleasure and
[1:35:08.920 --> 1:35:13.560]  an honor to actually get to talk to you um let's let's start with your first book the war
[1:35:13.560 --> 1:35:18.760]  conspiracy i i think i remember watching a video of you explaining how this was uh suppressed
[1:35:18.760 --> 1:35:25.960]  by our intelligence agencies in the beginning that was said in the video but not by me it was
[1:35:25.960 --> 1:35:32.920]  actually suppressed by its publisher bob merrill which was owned by it and t and it all happened
[1:35:32.920 --> 1:35:40.760]  at the time that it and t was collaborating with the cia to overthrow andy and chile so it's not
[1:35:40.760 --> 1:35:46.760]  surprising that the it and t didn't like a book that was criticizing what the cia did
[1:35:46.760 --> 1:35:51.800]  luckily that book is going to come out again after it's what is it for more than 30 years
[1:35:51.800 --> 1:35:57.160]  the book should be out in two or three months i think wow that's that is exciting besides i
[1:35:57.160 --> 1:36:04.920]  update it and uh look at uh the relevance most of the book is about the vietnam war of course but
[1:36:04.920 --> 1:36:14.040]  there's so many things happening deja vu all over again in iraq that uh i've expanded the book and
[1:36:14.040 --> 1:36:23.160]  look at particularly similarities between the john f kennedy assassination and uh 9 11 i mean that
[1:36:23.160 --> 1:36:28.760]  that may be and sound absolutely off the wall but and i thought it was the first time i spoke
[1:36:28.760 --> 1:36:35.480]  about it but it's one of the i am i am on the web talking about this and i have uh two or three
[1:36:35.480 --> 1:36:41.560]  versions of an article that gets bigger and bigger because unmistakably there are certain patterns
[1:36:41.560 --> 1:36:48.600]  that repeated themselves and suggest that the forces that work uh that drove us into war in
[1:36:48.600 --> 1:36:57.720]  vietnam in the uh 1960s are in some way connected to the forces that drove us into war in iraq in
[1:36:57.720 --> 1:37:03.240]  2003 well i'd have to agree with you there and uh especially i don't know if you've seen this
[1:37:03.240 --> 1:37:10.120]  confrontation but uh we are changed recently confronted uh gary hart about his uh open letter
[1:37:10.120 --> 1:37:15.640]  to uh the leader of iran i'm a dean of denigad where he alluded to the fact that well you know
[1:37:16.200 --> 1:37:21.080]  the uh the main in the uss uh that the sinking of that ship and of course the gulf of tonkin
[1:37:21.080 --> 1:37:25.720]  incident you know we we know that this uh administration may stage an attack to invade
[1:37:25.720 --> 1:37:29.160]  and it was very very it was very thinly veiled threat and when he would talk about it he's like
[1:37:29.160 --> 1:37:33.640]  well i wasn't threatening them personally i was just saying how this administration
[1:37:33.640 --> 1:37:37.560]  very much wants to go with iran and in the past they've done these sorts of things
[1:37:37.560 --> 1:37:42.600]  but then when he's asked about 9 11 he's like well there's no way 9 11 was in any way a false
[1:37:42.600 --> 1:37:49.000]  flag attack right well it's very hard for anyone uh who wants to be considered part of the establishment
[1:37:49.000 --> 1:37:57.400]  to you know it's it's as important to the people in power to marginalize the people talking about
[1:37:57.400 --> 1:38:04.840]  9 11 as it was uh way back and i'm old enough to remember this to marginalize people who said
[1:38:04.840 --> 1:38:11.000]  that kennedy wasn't killed by a loan nut and yet we now where there's virtually a consensus that
[1:38:11.000 --> 1:38:16.280]  oswald didn't do it alone um and we know that among the people who thought it was a conspiracy
[1:38:16.280 --> 1:38:24.440]  were president johnson and president nixon so we marginalized kukes uh were voicing publicly
[1:38:24.440 --> 1:38:29.720]  thoughts that were secretly shared in very high places absolutely but it seems like the mainstream
[1:38:29.720 --> 1:38:35.160]  media still pushes the idea that oswald was this loan shooter i don't know if you got to see the
[1:38:35.960 --> 1:38:41.400]  40th anniversary two-hour peace with peter jennings before he died i never watched those things
[1:38:41.400 --> 1:38:46.040]  but yes you know in advance what they're going to say yeah i think it was called something like
[1:38:46.040 --> 1:38:52.360]  jfk beyond conspiracy and you know they edited the footage and hacked it up to make it look like
[1:38:52.360 --> 1:38:56.440]  all these people had said that oswald did it and he was definitely the guy
[1:38:56.440 --> 1:39:00.520]  and anybody who questions you know the official version even though there are still you know
[1:39:01.560 --> 1:39:06.600]  a multitude of classified documents concerning the kennedy assassination you know we're wrong
[1:39:06.600 --> 1:39:12.840]  to think there was anything going on there well what really amused me was you know in 1978 the
[1:39:12.840 --> 1:39:17.560]  house of a committee on the fascination came out with a report that said there was a very high
[1:39:17.560 --> 1:39:24.440]  probability of shots coming also from the grassy knoll uh in addition to the school book
[1:39:24.440 --> 1:39:29.240]  depository i'm very sure about the grassy knoll show shots i'm not sure about the school book
[1:39:29.240 --> 1:39:35.400]  depository anyway the reaction of the new york times in the washington post on the same day
[1:39:35.400 --> 1:39:42.200]  in editorials was to say so what so it wasn't one loan nut it was two loan nuts now anyone who
[1:39:42.200 --> 1:39:48.840]  can force their mind to believe that sort of thing has been really deformed by participating in the
[1:39:48.840 --> 1:39:55.880]  twisted uh political processes of this country absolutely and i'm glad that you brought up
[1:39:55.880 --> 1:39:59.640]  the house select intelligence committee because there you did you had a government body saying
[1:39:59.640 --> 1:40:05.400]  look it looks like we have another shooter we've done the audio analysis uh there there definitely
[1:40:05.400 --> 1:40:09.640]  seems to be something going on at the grassy knoll and they put out this report and it's
[1:40:09.640 --> 1:40:13.960]  virtually ignored it's like hey yeah there was a conspiracy there was somebody else who shot
[1:40:13.960 --> 1:40:17.800]  kennedy but just move along we're never gonna try to find this person we're never gonna bring
[1:40:17.800 --> 1:40:23.800]  this back in a trial and we're never gonna question uh you know that that oswald was the uh force
[1:40:23.800 --> 1:40:28.760]  behind uh kennedy's death and then you know the debunkers always like to say that we have to come
[1:40:28.760 --> 1:40:33.560]  up with this grand scheme where everything's connected no it's not that at all it's that
[1:40:33.560 --> 1:40:38.760]  the majority of evidence the fact that they had you know cia agents on the scene dressed up like
[1:40:38.760 --> 1:40:45.080]  tramps or bums you know right there you know that should set off red flags the fact that we have
[1:40:45.080 --> 1:40:50.520]  on video uh the secret service agent right before they uh pull the corner getting told to to back
[1:40:50.520 --> 1:40:55.080]  off the back of the car and being sent away right before he shot in the head that should uh
[1:40:55.080 --> 1:41:01.240]  raise huge huge alarm bells a secret service should have been deployed or no actually i'm
[1:41:01.240 --> 1:41:08.920]  talking about the dallas police here the instructions normal instructions for the uh are for uh motorcycles
[1:41:08.920 --> 1:41:15.320]  that did be deployed to each side of an open car with the president in it and uh for some reason
[1:41:15.320 --> 1:41:21.720]  those uh instructions were changed by the secret service just before the kennedy of uh kennedy
[1:41:21.720 --> 1:41:26.840]  was the fascinating oh yes there's many many things that are wrong what's nice about that
[1:41:26.840 --> 1:41:33.480]  acoustic evidence suggesting a second shot is that that's science and uh steven uh uh
[1:41:33.480 --> 1:41:39.320]  steven jones of course is using scientific analysis to look at what happened to the towers
[1:41:39.320 --> 1:41:47.160]  and building seven and uh in the end science may may say that here because it's uh it it's very
[1:41:47.160 --> 1:41:51.640]  hard to argue with good science well i'm glad you brought up steven jones because one of the
[1:41:51.640 --> 1:41:56.680]  more compelling pieces of evidence uh that suggests that some some type of thermite may
[1:41:56.680 --> 1:42:01.560]  have been used is the fact that you have this molten metal pouring out of the tower uh a couple
[1:42:01.560 --> 1:42:06.520]  minutes before it crumbles and it's good you look that way yeah and i've got it on several
[1:42:06.520 --> 1:42:11.080]  different angles we covered in our last movie uh loose change final cut and you can see that this
[1:42:11.080 --> 1:42:17.880]  thing is not uh dispersing over 60 or 70 floors literally dropping 60 70 floors and still maintaining
[1:42:17.880 --> 1:42:23.400]  you know the same clarity the same like orange texture so the debunkers come out and they say
[1:42:23.400 --> 1:42:27.320]  oh well that's aluminum from the plane it's coming from the impact zone it's got to be aluminum
[1:42:27.320 --> 1:42:31.560]  while steven jones goes into the lab he shows what molten aluminum looks like especially
[1:42:31.560 --> 1:42:36.520]  when it's been mixed with you know paper and wood and furniture and all this other stuff and it
[1:42:36.520 --> 1:42:41.240]  still has this silvery glow it looks nothing like the metal that's pouring out of the world
[1:42:41.240 --> 1:42:46.920]  trade center and the problem is that again this molten steel could not be achieved unless we had
[1:42:46.920 --> 1:42:53.800]  about 2700 degrees Fahrenheit uh for it to occur yet jeff fuel only burns at about 1800 degrees uh
[1:42:53.800 --> 1:43:00.120]  1850 at its hottest so obviously you know that can't be from the jeff fuel you know he puts out the
[1:43:00.120 --> 1:43:05.560]  scientific paper he puts out the report and it's ignored by the mainstream media and then the debunkers
[1:43:05.560 --> 1:43:11.880]  switch from oh it's aluminum from the plane to its batteries on that floor i mean it seems like
[1:43:11.880 --> 1:43:16.360]  you know the people that don't want to believe this will throw out any ridiculous comment they can
[1:43:16.360 --> 1:43:23.080]  and the people that are actually doing the science like steven jones are are just you know gone after
[1:43:23.080 --> 1:43:29.080]  and slandered in the mainstream media well you can't expect to win these battles right away but uh
[1:43:29.720 --> 1:43:36.200]  you know it it wasn't clear at first if there would be a uh concerted effort to get the truth
[1:43:36.200 --> 1:43:42.520]  about 9 11 and now there are many many people working on it and at the beginning they said well
[1:43:42.520 --> 1:43:48.040]  yes but there are no scientists working on it and then you get people like steven jones who is
[1:43:48.920 --> 1:43:53.720]  a scientist and they thought well but his work and this is not peer reviewed and now of course
[1:43:53.720 --> 1:43:59.400]  there is a journey where everything is peer reviewed and uh i'm waiting for the regular
[1:43:59.400 --> 1:44:03.800]  physicists to wake up and pay more attention to this they are beginning to do this in other
[1:44:03.800 --> 1:44:10.440]  countries i believe yeah you and me both um you know i think 9 11 is so important because our entire
[1:44:10.440 --> 1:44:15.800]  foreign and domestic policy is still based on what the government and mainstream media have told us
[1:44:15.800 --> 1:44:22.360]  about 9 11 i see more you know things being declassified as the administration leaves office i think i
[1:44:22.360 --> 1:44:28.360]  see things like uh able danger coming to light i see maybe part of the uh congressional report
[1:44:28.360 --> 1:44:34.280]  that was redacted probably coming to light maybe being declassified but i hope so yeah but don't
[1:44:34.280 --> 1:44:40.040]  you agree that you know until we get the truth about 9 11 we're not going to be able to uh change
[1:44:40.040 --> 1:44:43.560]  this country you know in a positive manner we're not going to get be able to get rid of things
[1:44:43.560 --> 1:44:48.600]  like homeland security or the military commissions act or patriot acts one and two which have
[1:44:48.600 --> 1:44:53.560]  literally eviscerated the constitution and bill of rights i think one of the things that's become
[1:44:53.560 --> 1:44:59.560]  clear quite recently is you know in my book uh the road to 9 11 there are only two chapters
[1:44:59.560 --> 1:45:07.240]  about 9 11 itself and i focus very narrowly on one thing which is the behavior of vice president
[1:45:07.240 --> 1:45:14.360]  cheney in the so-called peoc or the bunker under the white house and the proclamation
[1:45:14.360 --> 1:45:19.480]  of cog continuity of government i always say it really should be called change of government
[1:45:19.480 --> 1:45:24.360]  because if you have a program that's going to suspend the constitution that's not exactly
[1:45:24.360 --> 1:45:31.720]  continuity and uh we're now seeing more and more that uh i said in my book that three of the things
[1:45:31.720 --> 1:45:38.440]  i think that were instituted by continuity of government were uh martial law or the capacity
[1:45:38.440 --> 1:45:46.520]  for martial law uh warrantless surveillance and warrantless attention and uh we now uh have a
[1:45:46.520 --> 1:45:53.080]  very good article in radar magazine where it points out that bush himself when he was talking about
[1:45:53.080 --> 1:45:59.480]  the warrantless surveillance after it was revealed by james rison in the new york times he said well
[1:45:59.480 --> 1:46:05.800]  we review it every 45 days as part of the procedures for ensuring continuity of government
[1:46:05.800 --> 1:46:13.480]  so it's the president himself who has corroborated what i said and linked warrantless surveillance
[1:46:13.480 --> 1:46:20.840]  to uh cog planning which really means the planning that uh cheney and rumsfeld have
[1:46:20.840 --> 1:46:27.320]  been engaged in for 20 years going back to the days of oliver north in the 1980s when
[1:46:27.320 --> 1:46:33.000]  he he was planning the same sort of thing and it was revealed back then that these were plans
[1:46:33.000 --> 1:46:37.960]  with suspension of the constitution sure we had uh we had one person actually bring it up during
[1:46:37.960 --> 1:46:42.120]  the iran contra hearings and he brought up the fact that they were building these fema camps
[1:46:42.120 --> 1:46:47.640]  and that they were going to suspend the constitution and congress's role in the government and when
[1:46:47.640 --> 1:46:52.440]  he was asking about it they said well you know we can't really discuss that we'd be more than happy
[1:46:52.440 --> 1:46:57.000]  to discuss it in a closed hearing where no one can hear anything and it was a democrat who said
[1:46:57.000 --> 1:47:03.000]  that senator annoying it was a democrat who asked the question from texas jack brooks and it was a
[1:47:03.000 --> 1:47:08.120]  democrat senator annoying he said well we would have to go into executive session and we have no
[1:47:08.120 --> 1:47:12.760]  way of knowing if they did in fact go into an executive session or not we still don't know
[1:47:12.760 --> 1:47:16.840]  and that really shatters the falls left for paradigm like you said it was democrats uh
[1:47:16.840 --> 1:47:21.160]  you know and republicans who were covering that up you know obviously it was the uh
[1:47:21.160 --> 1:47:26.520]  reagan administration who was on trial there but uh the democrats the ones saying oh well
[1:47:26.520 --> 1:47:30.120]  we can't talk about that that needs to go into a closed hearing i'm really glad you brought up
[1:47:30.120 --> 1:47:34.520]  continuity of government because uh that's going to be a big feature and especially cheney's role
[1:47:34.520 --> 1:47:39.320]  in the economy continuity of government in my new movie uh fabled enemies a lot of people don't
[1:47:39.320 --> 1:47:43.960]  understand that the the bunker government the shadow government whatever you want to call it
[1:47:43.960 --> 1:47:50.600]  was was put into place publicly on 9 11 as the attacks occurred when cheney went down into that
[1:47:50.600 --> 1:47:56.840]  p o c and you know there's all sorts of uh you know timeline discrepancies you know according
[1:47:56.840 --> 1:48:01.240]  to cheney himself in the very beginning he was there prior to the pentagon strike he went on msnbc
[1:48:01.240 --> 1:48:06.600]  and said it okay then when they figured out that normanetta testified and said oh you know there
[1:48:06.600 --> 1:48:10.440]  was an aid walking in while the uh plane was approaching the pentagon he was discussing
[1:48:10.440 --> 1:48:14.520]  things with cheney like the plane is 50 miles out the plane is 30 miles out the plane is 10 miles
[1:48:14.520 --> 1:48:18.440]  out to the order still stand he snaps his head around he says of course the order still stand
[1:48:18.440 --> 1:48:23.160]  have you heard anything to the contrary and we don't know what that order is there was no order
[1:48:23.160 --> 1:48:28.200]  is there certainly no orders have been given by the president at that point which would would you
[1:48:28.200 --> 1:48:33.320]  would have been the uh constitutional authority for them absolutely and there was no warnings given
[1:48:33.320 --> 1:48:37.320]  to a pentagon personnel that anything was approaching that building when in when in fact
[1:48:37.320 --> 1:48:41.800]  they knew something was approaching that building and then you have uh the 9 11 commission report
[1:48:41.800 --> 1:48:47.080]  that white washes the entire thing and says well he wasn't in that bunker till 954 so none of that
[1:48:47.080 --> 1:48:53.080]  actually happened now just recently the report is actually i was very glad to have that report
[1:48:53.080 --> 1:49:00.600]  because it helps define the area but not all of the report is live by any means but when they do
[1:49:01.560 --> 1:49:07.960]  ignore testimony of that such as cheney's only testimony they ignore the hominetta story they
[1:49:07.960 --> 1:49:14.840]  don't say a word about how the towers went down or about building seven then it it helps to find
[1:49:14.840 --> 1:49:19.800]  whether the sensitive areas that they're covering up well absolutely and uh you know cheney being
[1:49:19.800 --> 1:49:26.440]  in that bunker is a huge deal i also have an article that cheney was the one who warned uh
[1:49:27.160 --> 1:49:31.240]  juliani that the tower was going to come down he was making all sorts of calls and uh
[1:49:31.240 --> 1:49:35.560]  juliani had gone on barbara walters a few days after the attacks and discussed how cheney was
[1:49:35.560 --> 1:49:40.040]  the one that actually made that phone call to him now why is that important well how would cheney
[1:49:40.040 --> 1:49:45.480]  know that the towers were going to come down you know how is cheney the guy in charge of this order
[1:49:45.480 --> 1:49:50.760]  then you find out that scott fry signs this memo a couple months before 9 11 i want i want to say
[1:49:50.760 --> 1:49:56.200]  it was in july where shootdown authority is put solely into the hands of the vice president the
[1:49:56.200 --> 1:50:00.520]  secretary of defense donald rumsfeld or whoever's secretary of the defense at the time or the president
[1:50:01.160 --> 1:50:06.440]  you know taking it away from lieutenants kernels who may have seen a threat talking about intercept
[1:50:06.440 --> 1:50:11.000]  procedures is that correct um not not just the they could intercept them but they could shoot them
[1:50:11.000 --> 1:50:16.280]  down yeah all this was at the top level what the great innovation was that as of june 1st
[1:50:17.000 --> 1:50:22.520]  to intercept a plane which merely means sending a fighter up to find out what's happening the
[1:50:22.520 --> 1:50:32.040]  normal procedure there were 78 such interceptions in the month leading up before june 2001 and that
[1:50:32.040 --> 1:50:39.480]  two is that it's the language was that any military activity had to be handled by highest authority
[1:50:40.120 --> 1:50:46.520]  well a military plane going up is a military activity and that is clearly what
[1:50:48.440 --> 1:50:52.360]  caused trouble all right we'll be back after this with peter now beloved republic is on her
[1:50:52.360 --> 1:50:57.240]  knees the forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide but in liberty's
[1:50:57.240 --> 1:51:01.880]  darkest hour there is hope the first time in modern history the people are beginning to wake up
[1:51:01.880 --> 1:51:06.600]  it is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the new world

[1:54:26.200 --> 1:54:29.080]  before the Beatles and yesterday

[1:54:50.600 --> 1:55:07.560]  all right we are back it is the alex jones show i am jason bermas subbing in we're with peter
[1:55:07.560 --> 1:55:13.160]  dale scott and we're talking continuity of government and uh i just wanted to get your
[1:55:13.160 --> 1:55:18.120]  take on the uh the war games that they were running on the morning in 9 11 obviously there
[1:55:18.120 --> 1:55:23.000]  were many intersecting war games but one in particular has really caught my eye and that's
[1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:28.840]  global guardian which is the mass armageddon exercise that lasted uh before it was before
[1:55:28.840 --> 1:55:33.880]  9 11 last a little bit after but the thing that that caught my eye was the fact that they had five
[1:55:33.880 --> 1:55:39.960]  e4b doomsday planes which are command centers for this bunker or shadow government basically
[1:55:39.960 --> 1:55:45.800]  in case of a nuclear attack or you know continuity of government procedures going into a place
[1:55:45.800 --> 1:55:52.440]  and we know i mean cnn's now had to do a report on it that one of these plans was indeed on the
[1:55:52.440 --> 1:55:58.120]  scene of the pentagon strike so what are these e4b is doing that's a very good question and
[1:55:58.120 --> 1:56:06.440]  there you know there were it was on film at the time it was exhibited on cnn that very day it was
[1:56:06.440 --> 1:56:12.280]  could be seen from the people who were outside the white house it was flying around in the whole
[1:56:12.280 --> 1:56:19.800]  washington area not just the pentagon and yes that's um and of course they their base their their
[1:56:19.800 --> 1:56:27.160]  main base is offlet and uh that's where bush went when he left it it's so much that we don't know
[1:56:27.960 --> 1:56:38.440]  and i think that uh as i understand it um these things the the 9 11 commission requested
[1:56:38.440 --> 1:56:44.600]  documents that they knew about and there were whole levels of classification that they didn't
[1:56:44.600 --> 1:56:51.800]  break into this is why they can't find i believe uh there was obviously was a shoot down order
[1:56:51.800 --> 1:56:57.880]  issues on that day and they couldn't find it and i think the reason is that the shoot down order
[1:56:57.880 --> 1:57:02.120]  and the order for constituted continuity of government which by the way the commission
[1:57:02.120 --> 1:57:08.920]  confirms that it was instituted but they don't really they know when it came out but they don't
[1:57:08.920 --> 1:57:14.920]  know what that means i think that the whole everything to do with cog was so classified
[1:57:15.560 --> 1:57:22.600]  that it even used a special communications network and that's why i think the uh these
[1:57:22.600 --> 1:57:27.240]  things were being talked about by cheney not even in the bunker there was after all a democrat
[1:57:27.240 --> 1:57:34.120]  in the bunker and norman manetta he was talking about them in a in a telephone that was in the
[1:57:34.120 --> 1:57:40.280]  tunnel between the bunker and the white house and i think the main reason to having a telephone
[1:57:40.280 --> 1:57:45.240]  there was to have something for a classification that was even higher than what people in the
[1:57:45.240 --> 1:57:52.920]  bunker were cleared to be party to which is and so yes we don't know anything we have no
[1:57:52.920 --> 1:57:58.920]  documents about those uh those command planes but it does suggest that there was a very high
[1:57:58.920 --> 1:58:06.360]  degree of mobilization on that day at the time that the attack occurred and the report says
[1:58:06.360 --> 1:58:12.840]  in a kind of limp way well this may have facilitated the the speed of the response
[1:58:12.840 --> 1:58:18.280]  but that's such a ridiculous thing to say when there was no response at least no uh
[1:58:18.280 --> 1:58:22.680]  not the response you would want i'm with you peter we'll be back after this

[2:00:25.640 --> 2:00:31.320]  talking continuity of government and uh... 911 with peter dale scott obviously an accomplished
[2:00:31.320 --> 2:00:36.520]  scholar and author and uh... you know you just mentioned a few things that i want to
[2:00:36.520 --> 2:00:40.440]  truck over you said look you know they they could declare martial law while jeb bush
[2:00:40.440 --> 2:00:45.400]  declared martial law in florida a few days before 911 knowing uh...
[2:00:45.400 --> 2:00:48.360]  knowing well that his brother was going to be there on the morning of 911
[2:00:48.360 --> 2:00:52.440]  and then you also discussed how bush was taken to uh... off at air force base
[2:00:52.440 --> 2:00:56.120]  uh... before going back to dc while he was taken to off at n barks dale
[2:00:56.120 --> 2:00:58.680]  uh... two of the places where these drills were actually going on
[2:00:59.320 --> 2:01:03.880]  and you know to get back to this e four b thing according to the official version
[2:01:03.880 --> 2:01:08.040]  you know these e four b's were landed immediately after and during the attacks
[2:01:08.040 --> 2:01:12.040]  now i don't know if you're aware of this but there's a video of yet another white plane
[2:01:12.040 --> 2:01:17.080]  on the scene of the world trade center in restricted airspace after the first plane strike
[2:01:17.080 --> 2:01:22.760]  but before the second now it doesn't have the exact it's it's a pretty blurry video it's a zoom in
[2:01:22.760 --> 2:01:27.160]  it doesn't have the exact markings of an e four b it doesn't have that line and i can't tell whether
[2:01:27.160 --> 2:01:33.240]  it has that hub on the top and it seems to have a blue tail section and and blue underside wings
[2:01:33.240 --> 2:01:37.160]  but you know this is another white plane that appears to have to be military because it's
[2:01:37.160 --> 2:01:43.160]  in restricted airspace you know what's going on here and then we had to wait until august of last year
[2:01:43.160 --> 2:01:49.160]  to actually get the norad tapes and again the official line was well these drills immediately
[2:01:49.160 --> 2:01:53.560]  ceased as as soon as the attacks happen that's not the case you know i've listened through these tapes
[2:01:53.560 --> 2:01:58.920]  and i have a general on the phone to shy and mountain after a flight ninety three has been
[2:01:58.920 --> 2:02:05.160]  downed asking them to please take the inputs off the screen and as you mentioned before the break
[2:02:05.160 --> 2:02:09.160]  you know richard mires went before the nine eleven commission and said oh this helped our response
[2:02:09.160 --> 2:02:14.360]  because we had all these people at the command centers during these field training exercises
[2:02:14.360 --> 2:02:17.960]  yet how could it help their response when they didn't stop any of the attacks
[2:02:19.960 --> 2:02:25.560]  people at the need center complaining that they couldn't tell what was what was real and what was
[2:02:25.560 --> 2:02:32.760]  fake maybe not everyone the audience understands that there were radar blips uh it sort of entered
[2:02:32.760 --> 2:02:41.320]  entered into the radar screens to simulate approaching planes and in addition there was
[2:02:41.320 --> 2:02:48.120]  some real-time plane activity also and what those planes were i don't know this is this is more your
[2:02:48.120 --> 2:02:56.120]  expertise than mine because you handle photography and i've i of course just handled text well you
[2:02:56.120 --> 2:03:00.840]  know it just it drives me nuts that i have all these these people saying oh you're debunked they
[2:03:00.840 --> 2:03:06.680]  stopped these drills but you listen to the tapes and they're obviously confused you you go to the
[2:03:06.680 --> 2:03:11.240]  records and you find out well the national reconnaissance office and you know with a team from the
[2:03:11.240 --> 2:03:17.000]  cia is running a drill at 845 in the morning of ramming planes into buildings and i have this
[2:03:17.000 --> 2:03:21.560]  other clip that i'm going to be putting into fabled enemies uh the governor of maryland
[2:03:21.560 --> 2:03:27.080]  went on tv that morning and said that the local police uh dav mitchell had called him and said
[2:03:27.080 --> 2:03:33.560]  that he had a list of targets that included of the world trade center and pentagon on his desk
[2:03:33.560 --> 2:03:37.560]  uh you know early in the morning saying that they were going to be attacked in a list of others
[2:03:37.560 --> 2:03:42.680]  like the sears tower was on there and i believe the world trade center in baltimore but then you
[2:03:42.680 --> 2:03:48.920]  you have him you have him on tape saying that oh i do uh if i believe the man is uh paris glendoning
[2:03:48.920 --> 2:03:54.600]  is uh is the governor of maryland at the time and uh yeah he went on uh the local uh i believe it was
[2:03:54.600 --> 2:03:58.600]  fox washington and said those things and they kind of pressed them on they said are you telling me
[2:03:58.600 --> 2:04:03.000]  that you know dav mitchell had foreknowledge of the attacks like yeah and he's he's like we also
[2:04:03.000 --> 2:04:07.400]  had these other targets and what interests me about the other targets is you know the official
[2:04:07.400 --> 2:04:12.840]  line is that the four hijacked aircraft didn't even emit a hijacked code in other words these guys
[2:04:12.840 --> 2:04:17.240]  took it over there was no hijacked code there was no way of knowing it was hijacked well
[2:04:17.240 --> 2:04:22.600]  you know we also know that there were other planes that emitted hijacked codes you know
[2:04:22.600 --> 2:04:27.080]  in and out of uh alaskan airspace a korean airliner and we had other hijackings coming in
[2:04:27.080 --> 2:04:31.240]  from canada i want to get your take on that on the other side we're with peter dale scott and

[2:07:58.600 --> 2:08:10.600]  all right we are back with uh peter dale scott and we're talking 9-11 peter you know we talked
[2:08:10.600 --> 2:08:15.160]  a lot about uh you know continuity government we talked a lot about the drills now and possible
[2:08:15.160 --> 2:08:20.440]  foreknowledge i'd like to get your take on the initial congressional investigation because a
[2:08:20.440 --> 2:08:24.280]  lot of people don't even realize that that investigation took place they don't realize
[2:08:24.280 --> 2:08:30.040]  that it was headed by porter goss and bob graham two of the guys that were meeting with the head
[2:08:30.040 --> 2:08:35.720]  of the pakistani isi on the morning of 9-11 it later came out that this man had wired a hundred
[2:08:35.720 --> 2:08:39.960]  thousand dollars to otta just prior to the attacks which according to the official version would be
[2:08:39.960 --> 2:08:46.120]  one-fifth of the al qaeda funding for the operation and they redacted 27 pages in that you know the
[2:08:46.120 --> 2:08:51.000]  lead democrat on that was Pelosi you know a lot of people don't understand her involvement and there
[2:08:51.000 --> 2:08:58.360]  were 27 redacted pages well graham went on pbs uh in december of oh two and he actually said
[2:08:58.360 --> 2:09:03.000]  that there was a lot of evidence that foreign governments go governments were involved in
[2:09:03.000 --> 2:09:07.720]  the attack and not only the financial funding but other aspects as well and then when he was
[2:09:07.720 --> 2:09:12.520]  pressed on it he said that it was going to be classified for the next 20 to 30 years and wouldn't
[2:09:12.520 --> 2:09:17.320]  become public until it was turned over to the archives i ask you how can it how can we have
[2:09:17.320 --> 2:09:22.040]  a report that redacts 27 pages of foreign government involvement and then have an official
[2:09:22.040 --> 2:09:28.760]  report that doesn't even include any of this information well the uh there is a book out
[2:09:28.760 --> 2:09:37.480]  now about the 9-11 commission uh by philip shannon who's a new york times reporter there was a big
[2:09:37.480 --> 2:09:45.400]  fight in that section of the staff of the 9-11 commission the staff wanted to go back to the
[2:09:45.400 --> 2:09:52.680]  same material and they were overruled we know essentially that what that uh part of the the
[2:09:54.040 --> 2:09:59.800]  classified part of the uh joint committee report said it was talking about the fact that uh
[2:10:00.360 --> 2:10:08.440]  when the two of the two of the key uh hijackers or alleged hijackers i should say uh alhamdulillah
[2:10:08.440 --> 2:10:18.360]  uh uh came from this meeting in uh malaysia uh they were met at the airport by somebody
[2:10:18.360 --> 2:10:24.840]  who pretty clearly is some kind of intelligent asset for saudi arabia and they were given
[2:10:24.840 --> 2:10:31.560]  money and the place was found for them to stay and the man who was involved later changed his
[2:10:31.560 --> 2:10:39.480]  story the see we now have there's an fbi uh time timeline for everything that happened and it's
[2:10:39.480 --> 2:10:45.960]  being released i think the last three or four months uh and in that timeline we have these
[2:10:45.960 --> 2:10:52.120]  almi dar and alhamdulillah are met at the airport by somebody with a very strong connection to
[2:10:52.120 --> 2:10:59.000]  saudi arabia the man who takes care of passing them money and finding that they actually located them
[2:10:59.000 --> 2:11:08.200]  in his own apartment building and uh this was uh leaked out of that joint committee to newsweek
[2:11:08.200 --> 2:11:18.120]  in january of 2003 i think it is uh and uh the result of all that was was that graham was told
[2:11:18.120 --> 2:11:25.640]  that he graham was investigated and told that he faced indictment uh but we still have never had an
[2:11:25.640 --> 2:11:34.360]  official recognition of the fact that these two hijackers were here on some kind of government
[2:11:34.360 --> 2:11:40.120]  saudi sponsored government one book that does talk about this laurence white rights book
[2:11:40.120 --> 2:11:48.040]  the looming tower and even more clearly in an article he did for the new yorker um where he
[2:11:48.040 --> 2:11:55.800]  says that uh of course the cia is not by law allowed to sponsor intelligence operations inside
[2:11:55.800 --> 2:12:03.320]  this country but it's possible that they were clued into a saudi intelligence operation and that
[2:12:03.320 --> 2:12:10.360]  alhamdulillah and almi dar were part of that saudi intelligence operation well that seems to uh
[2:12:10.360 --> 2:12:14.520]  i'm just saying that seems to tie in with uh j michael springman the whistleblower
[2:12:14.520 --> 2:12:20.200]  who was working at the consulate in jeta in the uh mid eighties early nineties when he would you
[2:12:20.200 --> 2:12:25.560]  know tell these guys no you can't have a visa to uh go into the united states and he would be overruled
[2:12:25.560 --> 2:12:30.040]  by his superiors and they would tell him it was for national security reasons and one of the times
[2:12:30.040 --> 2:12:37.560]  he was overruled with the blind shake who was the kind of intellectual uh mentor for the whole
[2:12:37.560 --> 2:12:43.000]  okay the movement inside america yeah it's all very odd how it's connected in that manner
[2:12:43.000 --> 2:12:47.080]  and you know he goes on to say that he was told by other people within the cia
[2:12:47.080 --> 2:12:51.000]  that they had been doing this through the mid eighties with their asset osama bin laden
[2:12:51.000 --> 2:12:58.520]  to funnel these guys into our country i don't know that osama was directly a cia asset he
[2:12:58.520 --> 2:13:04.440]  certainly worked closely with the saudi government but a man who did work with the cia is ali mohamad
[2:13:04.440 --> 2:13:09.160]  have you talked about ali mohamad on this show before uh no i have one of you enlighten me
[2:13:09.160 --> 2:13:15.560]  okay well uh this is a man who ultimately he was very close to osama he was part of al-qaeda
[2:13:15.560 --> 2:13:24.120]  uh he was uh at a minimum it's admitted he was a an fb i uh informant although uh all that the
[2:13:24.120 --> 2:13:29.960]  commission heard was that he had applied for a job as an fb i know clearly he was an fb i
[2:13:29.960 --> 2:13:39.160]  informant and this became obvious in nineteen uh sorry um yes 1993 he was picked up by the
[2:13:39.160 --> 2:13:45.800]  canadians in vancouver airport because he was in the company of a known terrorist and he gave
[2:13:45.800 --> 2:13:51.640]  the rcmp a telephone number and said phone this number and you will release me and they
[2:13:51.640 --> 2:13:58.920]  found the number it was the san francisco office of the fb i he was released and he then went over
[2:13:58.920 --> 2:14:06.760]  to kenya and took photographs of the u.s embassy in kenya personally delivered them to osama
[2:14:06.760 --> 2:14:13.560]  bin laden and figured out where they should put the truck so that he ended up eventually being
[2:14:13.560 --> 2:14:21.880]  indicted for the so-called landmarks case in new york city um no i'm sorry if we're for the embassy
[2:14:21.880 --> 2:14:31.880]  bombings um so he was then in the hands of the u.s government and uh after 9 11 he told his fb i
[2:14:31.880 --> 2:14:38.040]  handle yes i trained i knew the hijackers and i trained them i told them where to sit on in the
[2:14:38.040 --> 2:14:44.200]  plane up in first class and i advised them to use box cutters and so on very very high level man
[2:14:44.200 --> 2:14:53.240]  at the center of al-qaeda's plot and at the minimum an fb i informant that i think really was a cia
[2:14:53.240 --> 2:15:00.200]  asset and it's again admitted that at one point he was the cia says they dropped him but here is
[2:15:00.200 --> 2:15:07.160]  a man who is in special forces u.s special forces and uh just took a little holiday from us special
[2:15:07.160 --> 2:15:17.160]  forces to go over and fight with uh the uh the so-called foreign legion of arab afghan and afghanistan
[2:15:17.160 --> 2:15:23.160]  now that's not something you can do if you're a regular uh officer and his commanding officer
[2:15:23.160 --> 2:15:28.280]  at port bragg was very upset it's clear that he was working for another agency and this
[2:15:28.280 --> 2:15:34.680]  certainly would not have been the fb i i think he was still a cia asset and uh i have a whole
[2:15:34.680 --> 2:15:40.840]  chapter about him in my book the road to nine eleven uh i believe that the first world trade
[2:15:40.840 --> 2:15:47.320]  center bombing in 1993 would never have happened if they hadn't been covering up for what this
[2:15:47.320 --> 2:15:54.040]  man was doing and when they they uh some of the people he was training in brooklyn and outside
[2:15:54.040 --> 2:16:03.080]  new york uh became involved in the murder of maya kahan and they they knew that it was conspiracy
[2:16:03.080 --> 2:16:10.440]  and they found a whole lot of uh try terrorist training manuals that ali mohammed had supplied
[2:16:10.440 --> 2:16:17.000]  from fort bragg to them and then they came out and said that they had one man and they stopped
[2:16:17.000 --> 2:16:23.560]  there and said this man was familiar language for americans he was alone not to act at all by
[2:16:23.560 --> 2:16:29.880]  himself when they all had ready had picked up the his two associates and had all this uh
[2:16:29.880 --> 2:16:35.800]  incriminating evidence which was suppressed the other two went on to take part in the bombing
[2:16:35.800 --> 2:16:42.440]  of the world trade center in 1993 so i think it's a major scandal and that's one of the things that
[2:16:42.440 --> 2:16:47.240]  the nine eleven commission was covering up yeah well we know you know some of these hijackers
[2:16:47.240 --> 2:16:53.240]  trained at u.s navy stations in pensacola florida we know others lived with and rented from their
[2:16:53.240 --> 2:16:58.200]  names certainly did unquestionably right exactly well they didn't want to talk about it after their
[2:16:58.200 --> 2:17:03.000]  exact names you know list of their addresses and their other licenses as that pensacola navy
[2:17:03.000 --> 2:17:08.680]  station and this is one of the conspicuous gaps in the nine eleven report we really have major
[2:17:08.680 --> 2:17:14.920]  problems about who the alleged hijackers were so we've been very unusual actually for al-qaeda to
[2:17:14.920 --> 2:17:21.000]  get on plane using their own names yeah well again you know in my new film i have a diana albrin
[2:17:21.000 --> 2:17:26.120]  who was a neighbor of walley dal sherry who actually called the cia on him and she went public the
[2:17:26.120 --> 2:17:30.200]  next day again this is fox washington and she's like yeah i call the cia on them and they weren't
[2:17:30.200 --> 2:17:35.320]  interested well why wouldn't the cia be interested in these people that were supposedly on the terror
[2:17:35.320 --> 2:17:40.280]  watch list that had all these connections we know again two of them lived with and rented from
[2:17:40.280 --> 2:17:46.600]  uh... an fb i informant and if this whole thing is real this the al-qaeda is the number one
[2:17:46.600 --> 2:17:51.400]  terrorism group in america and we have to get al-qaeda why is it that the washington post
[2:17:51.400 --> 2:17:56.920]  is now reporting on sunday that all the people involved in the u ss coal bombing
[2:17:56.920 --> 2:18:02.040]  have either escaped or been let go you would think you know we have these institutions of abu
[2:18:02.040 --> 2:18:08.440]  grabe and gitmo these would be top priority guests in those facilities yeah of course they were
[2:18:08.440 --> 2:18:14.440]  let go in him and uh... and uh... but this is this is this goes to the heart of the problem
[2:18:14.440 --> 2:18:22.120]  you see we we work with government who themselves engage in terrorism and we haven't even mentioned
[2:18:22.120 --> 2:18:29.720]  pakistan yet pakistan would probably be the number one example uh... pakistan's is i was our
[2:18:29.720 --> 2:18:38.360]  principal asset in afghanistan in the nineteen eighties and uh... we did things uh... pakistan's
[2:18:38.360 --> 2:18:44.760]  way which meant that half the aid that we sent to afghanistan the eighties ended up with them
[2:18:44.760 --> 2:18:51.560]  in the hands of a man called hekmatyar who was passionately anti-american and was an ally of
[2:18:52.680 --> 2:19:00.280]  uh... bin laden and uh... ended up being uh... backer of the taliban against the americans
[2:19:00.280 --> 2:19:07.720]  and another man haqqani by the way principal cia asset in afghanistan is now a principal
[2:19:07.720 --> 2:19:13.560]  supporter of the taliban we did all of these things to please pakistan because uh...
[2:19:14.440 --> 2:19:21.000]  well why because uh... you know because of programs that have been in place for decades
[2:19:21.880 --> 2:19:29.480]  pakistan is not if you want to bring a democracy to asia pakistan is not a good country to use as
[2:19:29.480 --> 2:19:38.200]  your sort of land-based aircraft carrier uh... but we were stuck with these allies and that has
[2:19:38.200 --> 2:19:42.200]  contaminated all of our policies all right we're going to be back with peter dale scott after the

[2:22:49.320 --> 2:22:52.920]  i've been waiting patiently for the government and mainstream media to inform you of what is
[2:22:52.920 --> 2:22:57.960]  turning out to be the biggest problem facing the world in the last 50 years for the last three years
[2:22:57.960 --> 2:23:01.800]  the earth has consumed more food than it has been able to produce and it has now finally caught up
[2:23:01.800 --> 2:23:06.120]  with us in the us commodities such as flour and rice are already being rationed and the next
[2:23:06.120 --> 2:23:10.760]  rice crop won't be available for another four to five months it's fall in the southern hemisphere
[2:23:10.760 --> 2:23:14.200]  and many countries are short the food necessary to make it through the winter and have stopped
[2:23:14.200 --> 2:23:19.640]  exporting certain commodities altogether remember our trade deficit trillions of dollars have stacked
[2:23:19.640 --> 2:23:24.920]  up outside the country and are now rushing in to buy our food production at any price by late summer
[2:23:24.920 --> 2:23:29.320]  if not early fall it is likely our government will step in and control food and food exports under

[2:24:41.800 --> 2:24:46.440]  you know he's just has a plethora of work after that that's you know the assassination

[2:24:52.280 --> 2:24:58.040]  drugs oil and war and of course as late as the road to 9 11 wealth empire and the future of america
[2:24:58.040 --> 2:25:01.400]  we're going to go to your calls in this final segment with uh... peter dale scott
[2:25:01.400 --> 2:25:04.440]  let's go to fred in uh... philadelphia freddy with us
[2:25:05.640 --> 2:25:12.120]  hi uh... peter i before i get to the subject of of uh... 9-1-1 i want to ask you are you
[2:25:12.120 --> 2:25:18.120]  familiar with the book called farewell uh... to america that was uh... america
[2:25:18.120 --> 2:25:27.640]  uh... by the author's name is given as heifer well we don't know the real author but it came
[2:25:27.640 --> 2:25:34.920]  from france and we think probably french intelligent um and the the books ended up in the
[2:25:36.600 --> 2:25:43.560]  in the doorway of a friend of mine bill turner and i have a copy uh it's got some useful information
[2:25:43.560 --> 2:25:48.280]  and i think it's got some disinformation but you know we knew so little about the kind of the
[2:25:48.280 --> 2:25:54.440]  assassination back then that it was a useful book today i don't think it's very useful okay uh i
[2:25:54.440 --> 2:26:04.360]  want to i want to go back to 9-1-1 and say um on the issue of the f a a and uh these video
[2:26:04.360 --> 2:26:13.080]  telecommunication bridges or phone um phone bridges as they're colloquially known uh
[2:26:14.520 --> 2:26:22.760]  there was a 9-1-1 a truth 9-1-1 writer uh that mentioned that uh jane garvey had had uh
[2:26:24.120 --> 2:26:30.680]  either testified or an interview that slipped out that they had um redundant communications
[2:26:30.680 --> 2:26:40.280]  uh even before um uh you know the the first plane hitting the towers and as a matter of law or
[2:26:40.280 --> 2:26:48.200]  regulation they probably have to maintain a constant um um you know official phone links
[2:26:49.160 --> 2:26:56.040]  and uh what is what is your uh information on the maintenance of those and the cover up
[2:26:56.040 --> 2:27:03.880]  uh because those are not now available well you know all uh this is a bit out of my area
[2:27:03.880 --> 2:27:09.560]  because it's technical i i've talked to a man called robin horton who was himself an air traffic
[2:27:09.560 --> 2:27:17.640]  controller once um i think the most alarming symptom is the fact that a lot of the f a a people
[2:27:17.640 --> 2:27:22.840]  involved recorded their experience of that day and then a supervisor came around and took all the
[2:27:22.840 --> 2:27:28.920]  tape and before their eyes chopped them up into little pieces and threw it in the garbage can
[2:27:28.920 --> 2:27:34.280]  in several garbage cans didn't even throw it in one right so i should have said several garbage can
[2:27:34.280 --> 2:27:41.080]  so uh there has been a massive uh cover up in this area and by the way i want to alert you
[2:27:41.080 --> 2:27:47.720]  and everybody to the fact that the uh commission said that their documents their exhibits which
[2:27:47.720 --> 2:27:53.880]  they did not release unlike the warren commission which did would be released starting in january
[2:27:53.880 --> 2:28:00.120]  2009 well the national archive at present is trying to process those documents for release
[2:28:00.680 --> 2:28:07.320]  they got help they they got cooperation from the fbi and after quite a long delay they're
[2:28:07.320 --> 2:28:12.920]  beginning to get cooperation from the cia they haven't even had an answer to their letters
[2:28:12.920 --> 2:28:19.880]  from the department of defense and from the f a a who are i think two of the principally uh
[2:28:19.880 --> 2:28:27.400]  involved agencies here so if there isn't some kind of pressure on congress to get a law requiring
[2:28:27.400 --> 2:28:33.720]  these agencies to release their documents we may never know i i unfortunately don't have the
[2:28:33.720 --> 2:28:41.640]  technical competence to get into uh an area that is uh of course extremely important and some people
[2:28:41.640 --> 2:28:46.760]  have done very good work in this area all right let's uh let's shoot to uh greg in new jersey
[2:28:47.400 --> 2:28:53.240]  greggy with us hi jen i got a comment and a question uh first the comment the thing that
[2:28:53.240 --> 2:28:57.960]  really blows my mind after serving in the military for as long as i did is that we're trying they're
[2:28:57.960 --> 2:29:04.520]  trying to tell us that that every air force whether it be naval or the u.s. air force
[2:29:04.520 --> 2:29:11.160]  somehow could not in any way shape or form intercept or at least get airborne to intercept
[2:29:11.160 --> 2:29:15.560]  these planes i find this is so hard to believe especially when you consider the fact that you
[2:29:15.560 --> 2:29:19.720]  had f16 sitting on the ground at lennick city i agree with you greg you just hold on because we
[2:29:19.720 --> 2:29:24.200]  got to go to uh break peter thank you so much for joining us uh where can people find your

[2:31:12.760 --> 2:31:18.440]  pioneer mother of two little children but a cruel cunning kamachi indian raid changed all that
[2:31:19.080 --> 2:31:25.640]  changed her to a young widow and an indian prisoner her story is told in a history book i read quote
[2:31:25.640 --> 2:31:30.760]  one of this lady's children was a little daughter about two months old and as the indians were tired
[2:31:30.760 --> 2:31:35.960]  of hearing it cry they determined to kill it an indian snatched it from the arms of its mother and
[2:31:35.960 --> 2:31:41.800]  threw it in a deep pool of water with the intention of drowning the poor little innocent the heroic

[2:34:22.760 --> 2:34:27.560]  family look we're not going swimming we're not going to a picnic because i never take off uh
[2:34:27.560 --> 2:34:34.280]  i'm going to come in and talk about these police because i saw the footage uh of philadelphia
[2:34:34.920 --> 2:34:40.440]  where they pull a car over and like 25 cops come in and beat and billy club but they run up like
[2:34:40.440 --> 2:34:47.160]  wild monkeys on the non-resisting citizens and start kicking and jumping on the car like gorillas i
[2:34:47.160 --> 2:34:53.480]  mean if these are supposed mad dog killers the police shouldn't run it for their car and then
[2:34:53.480 --> 2:34:57.880]  and then they pull them out billy club and beat them the guys don't resist but they charge them with
[2:34:57.880 --> 2:35:02.440]  resisting you know i try to like the cops but they've been brainwashed they've been conditioned uh
[2:35:02.440 --> 2:35:08.280]  you know to to to carry the sound and then i saw people on the message board at infoworks.com
[2:35:08.280 --> 2:35:12.840]  or commenting so i'm saying hey this is good because they watch the newscast where they go well
[2:35:13.400 --> 2:35:18.840]  they thought the guys might have been involved in a shooting in another part of the city and
[2:35:18.840 --> 2:35:23.960]  a few days before a cop got shot in town and so they're they're on edge and the cops say we're
[2:35:23.960 --> 2:35:31.240]  going to go ahead and charge them for us beating them up and it's all on close up video yeah these
[2:35:31.240 --> 2:35:35.720]  guys get soccer kicked i mean soccer kick the guy runs up and is soccer kicking them it's well over
[2:35:35.720 --> 2:35:39.640]  a dozen people attacking three people they got the dogs out they get the tonneau when the cops
[2:35:39.640 --> 2:35:45.640]  get there when the cops first get there they attack the car they're like mad dogs but but that's not
[2:35:45.640 --> 2:35:53.560]  enough then footage comes out in austin or right outside austin where a guy with no criminal record
[2:35:53.560 --> 2:35:59.160]  well spoken he gets pulled over for not using a turn signal and the cop wants to search his car
[2:35:59.160 --> 2:36:02.600]  so the young man says no we're gonna get him on the show by the way for in the next two days
[2:36:02.600 --> 2:36:07.800]  Trey's working on it he says no you know i have rights and so the cop says that's it you're going
[2:36:07.800 --> 2:36:12.920]  to jail for no turn signal and the cops on the things say yeah we take you to jail for no seat
[2:36:12.920 --> 2:36:18.760]  belt turn signals now for a lot of the speed limit they're building more prisons it's all but the
[2:36:18.760 --> 2:36:23.640]  illegal aliens they admit that they don't arrest them for driving no id none of that and then a
[2:36:23.640 --> 2:36:29.000]  video came out today there's like 10 others where you got this guy he's done this he's they're trying
[2:36:29.000 --> 2:36:35.800]  to do a sobriety test in the police station uh and and the guy says look i'm tired of doing this
[2:36:35.800 --> 2:36:40.200]  you've just been choking me now this one but what the cops released and he says please stop choking
[2:36:40.200 --> 2:36:45.160]  me and then the guy goes and sits down the cop comes over and squeeze his neck going you get up
[2:36:45.160 --> 2:36:50.440]  and do what i say he's torturing him right there and then the guy stands up and he says man i'm
[2:36:50.440 --> 2:36:55.080]  gonna press charges on you you know you've hurt me you've been choking me and he sits back down
[2:36:55.080 --> 2:36:59.560]  and the cop says that's it i'm tasering you and tasers and these are cattle prods like in a fema
[2:36:59.560 --> 2:37:06.120]  camp or nazi germany it's all been legitimized there's deaths every day uh we've entered a new
[2:37:06.120 --> 2:37:13.480]  vortex of evil and uh i mean i just want people to know this is tearing my guts out i mean i can't
[2:37:13.480 --> 2:37:18.600]  think about anything else but this because i'm seeing cops every 10 feet there goes one right
[2:37:18.600 --> 2:37:23.320]  there uh the borders are wide open the government's totally lawless the government takes children's
[2:37:23.320 --> 2:37:29.320]  DNA at birth and does nothing about it uh in william louis's film that we have at info wars.com
[2:37:29.320 --> 2:37:34.600]  washing your fire he has all the taser footage for the guy doesn't have an id so they taser him
[2:37:34.600 --> 2:37:40.360]  now they say in in canada they tell you don't have a train ticket it has quote punishment
[2:37:40.360 --> 2:37:46.040]  judge jury execution i just want the police to know that's because the country the world is going
[2:37:46.040 --> 2:37:52.600]  into receivership you've been trained to do this so as things bankrupt uh so you can take control
[2:37:52.600 --> 2:37:59.480]  and and and i just saw people on there defending them because they put out this propaganda uh
[2:37:59.480 --> 2:38:05.240]  about how this guy had you know these guys they beat up in philadelphia it said well they thought
[2:38:05.240 --> 2:38:10.200]  they might have been suspects but then they didn't charge him with with the quote crime they said
[2:38:10.200 --> 2:38:14.600]  they thought they might have been involved in first they had to dehumanize them in the media
[2:38:15.320 --> 2:38:20.120]  and then they said they charge him with assaulting the cops i mean now on video
[2:38:21.560 --> 2:38:26.600]  they have i mean it's come out with cedric benzin with washington i mean the chicago bear
[2:38:26.600 --> 2:38:33.320]  or this private police or these true private mercenaries that's what lcra is they surveil
[2:38:33.320 --> 2:38:38.440]  all of austin i mean i know they're former head security guy i don't know man i just look
[2:38:38.440 --> 2:38:42.840]  vermice i that's the problem i can't get off the treadmill i can't quit thinking about it i'm
[2:38:42.840 --> 2:38:47.960]  trying to make myself get away from the work because you know i'm so not even burned out i'm
[2:38:47.960 --> 2:38:51.640]  just like just trying to get away from it and i can't even do that but listen go ahead and bring
[2:38:51.640 --> 2:38:57.480]  up william louis it's just we gotta fight back we gotta get the word out we gotta resist this thing
[2:38:57.480 --> 2:39:02.600]  and we gotta have the police realize that that that i'm tired of seeing police riots i'm i'm
[2:39:02.600 --> 2:39:07.480]  tired of seeing them feed on us i'm tired of the justice and we're just like a third-world
[2:39:07.480 --> 2:39:12.680]  country now bernice i agree man and uh you can see the story over at info wars dot com the video
[2:39:12.680 --> 2:39:17.400]  tells it all i mean these guys really get jack booted i mean three people out of the car on
[2:39:17.400 --> 2:39:21.960]  the ground on their bellies right off the bat and they are just assaulted mercilessly again the
[2:39:21.960 --> 2:39:28.680]  dogs are out the batons are out and the soccer kicks are in other than the cia guy now confirmed to
[2:39:28.680 --> 2:39:35.000]  be cia and and he just gets out he's got his hand to the side they execute him to make sure he died
[2:39:35.000 --> 2:39:40.280]  they didn't bound him real tight while he bled to death and uh you know this is what they do this is
[2:39:40.280 --> 2:39:45.640]  and it's just tearing my guts out to know that my children are growing up in a country that isn't
[2:39:45.640 --> 2:39:51.000]  free and uh you know to know that my you know this kind of government perfect but i mean this is
[2:39:51.000 --> 2:39:55.160]  like reconstruction or something we're just paramilitary gangs are just running around
[2:39:55.880 --> 2:40:01.400]  folks study watch the movie outlaw josey wales go rent it tonight get it on netflix outlaw josey
[2:40:01.400 --> 2:40:08.680]  wales that's based on true stories uh it's based on the book headed to texas it's actually based
[2:40:08.680 --> 2:40:15.400]  on a composite of true stories and that's exactly what we're dealing with and we're in a red
[2:40:15.400 --> 2:40:21.240]  level crisis they have been scientifically trained to do this it is totally illegal the stuff that
[2:40:21.240 --> 2:40:26.840]  will not be great it goes on everywhere get washington you're fired get loose change file cut i'm
[2:40:26.840 --> 2:40:32.600]  begging the listeners get more aggressive spam every website go on to every message board get the

[2:40:38.440 --> 2:40:44.120]  get past your quote brotherhood and the weird gang cult you're in the gang psychology and it's not
[2:40:44.120 --> 2:40:49.080]  about hating cops is that we hate the police uh all that does is further compact them into their
[2:40:49.080 --> 2:40:55.880]  gang mentality but at the same time we must expose what they are doing i mean folks they're
[2:40:55.880 --> 2:41:01.320]  hiring felons of illegal aliens to be police now in military the stuff you see going on in iraq
[2:41:01.320 --> 2:41:06.840]  with snuff videos all of it that is that is the reality of what we're dealing with and they're
[2:41:06.840 --> 2:41:11.960]  all coming back to be cops and it's going to get worse and worse the globalists scientifically
[2:41:11.960 --> 2:41:16.840]  have crafted this we are going into total tyranny look i'm gonna let you get to william lewis

[2:41:55.480 --> 2:41:59.320]  though it's over the phone yeah yeah absolutely you know i've been a fan of your work in fact uh
[2:41:59.320 --> 2:42:05.000]  in plain sight was uh one of the first documentaries outside of the alex jones library
[2:42:05.000 --> 2:42:09.800]  that i was able to share with my family and friends and really get a reaction it was really
[2:42:09.800 --> 2:42:15.560]  a tight knit uh 60 or 70 minute documentary you know depending on which version you got
[2:42:15.560 --> 2:42:19.000]  that really opened a lot of people's eyes up to the physical evidence
[2:42:19.000 --> 2:42:22.920]  and now you've gone out on your own and you've done this uh i'd even call it kind of like a
[2:42:22.920 --> 2:42:27.960]  mister lewis goes to washington and gotten all these pundits have have all this great footage
[2:42:27.960 --> 2:42:32.040]  of how our rights have been eviscerated all this tazering footage you know from the don't taze
[2:42:32.040 --> 2:42:37.400]  me bro guy to uh like alex said the kid who wouldn't show his identification in the library and was
[2:42:37.400 --> 2:42:41.400]  physically assaulted for it i mean why don't you just tell people about this new project
[2:42:42.920 --> 2:42:49.480]  well this new project uh took us uh a couple of years to actually assemble and um it wasn't our
[2:42:49.480 --> 2:42:55.400]  intention necessarily to go in this covering 911 but you know it's really hard to talk about any
[2:42:55.400 --> 2:42:59.240]  of today's current politics without bringing it up because it applies to just about everything
[2:42:59.240 --> 2:43:05.000]  we're talking about uh so we we went out to some uh events that were going on in washington over a
[2:43:05.000 --> 2:43:13.080]  couple year period and uh interviewed people west coast east coast just trying to uh get a good even
[2:43:14.200 --> 2:43:20.600]  um perspective of of how the american people truly feel and i mean they were very candid uh
[2:43:21.720 --> 2:43:25.560]  there's hardly one person that we talked to who didn't understand that there was some type of a
[2:43:25.560 --> 2:43:30.040]  problem going on in this country and we didn't have to tell them about all the legislation that
[2:43:30.040 --> 2:43:35.960]  was you know taken place in the past seven years many of them were aware of you know the usa patriot
[2:43:35.960 --> 2:43:40.760]  act or the john warner defense act or whatever the military commission's act and uh you know
[2:43:40.760 --> 2:43:46.120]  they would give us the solution that they uh want to see implemented right there on the spot and
[2:43:46.120 --> 2:43:49.160]  you know that's what's so great about this is because you you don't know what the american
[2:43:49.160 --> 2:43:54.440]  people are willing to do unless you go talk to them and ask them okay we've got a problem what
[2:43:54.440 --> 2:44:00.680]  are you willing to do fix the problem and you know overwhelmingly in our conversations with these
[2:44:00.680 --> 2:44:08.040]  people uh running for office comes up as a you know this is our last ditch effort in other
[2:44:08.040 --> 2:44:13.400]  words you know this is uh it's no longer a matter of just going and voting and you know this is
[2:44:13.400 --> 2:44:17.880]  going to be my contribution to our political system it's just getting the right guy in office
[2:44:17.880 --> 2:44:23.240]  that's just one guy that's you know the executive branch is supposed to have the same power as any
[2:44:23.240 --> 2:44:27.160]  of the other three branches so what good is that one man going to do if he goes in there and he
[2:44:27.160 --> 2:44:31.320]  says i'm going to follow the constitution i'm not going to usurp any extra power for the executive
[2:44:31.320 --> 2:44:38.360]  branch then truly what power does he have over those other two branches we've got to infiltrate
[2:44:39.240 --> 2:44:45.400]  the legislative branch we've got to put people into office that we know are people like you and me
[2:44:45.400 --> 2:44:50.440]  people who know what the constitution says and you know aren't willing to play the games of
[2:44:50.440 --> 2:44:56.600]  washington in other words you know bring back uh checks and balances again you know isn't that
[2:44:56.600 --> 2:45:00.760]  the goal is to actually have a government foreign by the people once more and i think one of the
[2:45:00.760 --> 2:45:05.320]  big problems is that you know your average congressman or senator is making you know
[2:45:05.320 --> 2:45:11.320]  somewhere between 80 and a hundred thousand dollars a year uh for doing that job and they're
[2:45:11.320 --> 2:45:16.600]  making millions if not billions in the private sector uh for the very same lobbyists that help
[2:45:16.600 --> 2:45:23.240]  their campaign out sure those those office buildings in washington dc are right next to the
[2:45:23.240 --> 2:45:26.840]  you know the corporate corporation buildings are right next to our government buildings
[2:45:27.400 --> 2:45:32.920]  they are side by side working in coordination with each other there is no separation of
[2:45:32.920 --> 2:45:37.720]  you know our our business or the the business world and and washington dc they've become one
[2:45:37.720 --> 2:45:42.600]  we don't have a president of the united states we have a ceo he's running the business of the
[2:45:42.600 --> 2:45:48.360]  country that's all he's interested in and you know people's civil liberties and their rights
[2:45:48.360 --> 2:45:54.280]  just go by the wayside because corporations don't care about anything except the bottom line
[2:45:54.280 --> 2:45:59.160]  which is the profit line and you know if they're not making profit if the government's not making
[2:45:59.160 --> 2:46:05.640]  profit then you know if they're not uh achieving their goal in other words their goals to make
[2:46:05.640 --> 2:46:12.280]  money absolutely their their bottom line is uh the almighty dollar and profit and really control
[2:46:12.280 --> 2:46:16.920]  because you know again the lobbyists control whether these guys get elected or not uh it's
[2:46:16.920 --> 2:46:22.280]  very rare that anybody is actually able to win a congressional campaign or a senatorial campaign
[2:46:23.000 --> 2:46:27.720]  by grassroots i mean what the one one time i can say it happened is when governor jesse
[2:46:27.720 --> 2:46:32.840]  ventura got in but if you're not backed by these people you don't have commercials you don't have
[2:46:32.840 --> 2:46:38.280]  public awareness and you really don't have a shot at that office i think that that definitely needs
[2:46:38.280 --> 2:46:43.320]  to change in this country and i think it needs to be an awakening of the people to get them re-energized
[2:46:43.320 --> 2:46:48.760]  to follow politics once more in this country i mean more people are interested in american idol and
[2:46:48.760 --> 2:46:53.160]  that kind of nonsense and their and their local sports team then they even know what the three
[2:46:53.160 --> 2:46:56.600]  branches of government are i mean how many times have i walked up to somebody and said you know
[2:46:56.600 --> 2:47:00.200]  what are the three branches of government they're like i don't know what you mean is it a tree i'm
[2:47:00.200 --> 2:47:04.680]  like no there's three branches there's the judicial the executive and the legislative and they're
[2:47:04.680 --> 2:47:09.240]  supposed to keep a balance of one another and if one goes astray the other goes after him and it
[2:47:09.240 --> 2:47:14.520]  doesn't happen anymore you know national security privileges are invoked uh... new agencies are
[2:47:14.520 --> 2:47:19.640]  erected such as the homeland security agency and the new bills are passed eviscerating uh...
[2:47:19.640 --> 2:47:24.600]  everyday people's rights such as the military commissions act which ended habeas corpus which
[2:47:24.600 --> 2:47:29.880]  has been around since twelve fifteen the magna carta yeah and you know the funny thing about all
[2:47:29.880 --> 2:47:37.160]  this is that the people that they put in place kind of as their gatekeepers you know to be able to
[2:47:37.160 --> 2:47:41.800]  supposedly regulate all of these things in other words if uh... you know if somebody has to go
[2:47:41.800 --> 2:47:48.440]  to fisa and say we need a court order to search or to do whatever then you know fisa generally
[2:47:48.440 --> 2:47:54.520]  grants that warrant no problems no questions asked it's unusual for that to be denied but you know
[2:47:54.520 --> 2:48:01.160]  we just saw a report come out what was it a week ago where uh... those fisa uh...
[2:48:01.160 --> 2:48:05.640]  uh... one of my fan here the uh... request for you know buying on you have like doubled
[2:48:06.360 --> 2:48:11.560]  uh... since nine-one-one and those are just the programs that we know about the ones that we
[2:48:11.560 --> 2:48:16.440]  talked about in washington you're fired are the secret programs that they don't want you to know
[2:48:16.440 --> 2:48:21.560]  about uh... yes the ones that comes all this is up there giving his testimony on telling you that
[2:48:21.560 --> 2:48:27.320]  you know i can't uh... uh... you know no but no we're not buying on you in this program or
[2:48:27.960 --> 2:48:31.800]  that but you know the question that you just asked me doesn't pertain to the program that
[2:48:31.800 --> 2:48:35.960]  we're speaking to today that that word program you know that's their code word that's their
[2:48:36.520 --> 2:48:40.520]  their work play the way they get away with lying to your faith and you don't know it
[2:48:41.720 --> 2:48:47.080]  well i would say this you know we had a guy called go public for a tnt saying that
[2:48:47.080 --> 2:48:51.560]  all of the information a tnt was getting was wired into the quote-unquote secret room
[2:48:51.560 --> 2:48:54.440]  he tried to bring this up in a court of law it was thrown out
[2:48:54.440 --> 2:49:00.840]  and then now he's in a uh... in a in a battle you know basically suing these guys
[2:49:00.840 --> 2:49:04.200]  uh... trying to bring this to light and they're deciding whether or not he can actually sue him
[2:49:04.200 --> 2:49:08.520]  and the only time i saw this presented in the mainstream media was on keith oberman for eight
[2:49:08.520 --> 2:49:12.680]  minutes and when i bring it up most people look at me like i have a third eye and i'm like no
[2:49:12.680 --> 2:49:17.240]  listen this guy got on tv and said look all of your phone calls are going into this one area
[2:49:17.240 --> 2:49:22.120]  all your emails are going into this one area and it's a secure room by our government our
[2:49:22.120 --> 2:49:25.240]  government should not be tracking and tracing every little thing we do
[2:49:26.920 --> 2:49:30.840]  no and that's just one room you know we we know about fifteen others
[2:49:31.640 --> 2:49:35.960]  the you know spread throughout the country not be necessarily need to have access to all those
[2:49:35.960 --> 2:49:41.400]  i mean just having uh... being you know being able to tap into the hub of just one telecommunications
[2:49:41.400 --> 2:49:46.200]  hub is is enough to get you uh... just about anything that you need i mean every
[2:49:46.200 --> 2:49:49.640]  every electronic communication that you can possibly imagine
[2:49:49.640 --> 2:49:53.720]  uh... we're talking about blanket data mining every single american
[2:49:53.720 --> 2:49:56.920]  you know if you don't have a problem with your telephone conversations
[2:49:56.920 --> 2:50:00.760]  being listened to them you know
[2:50:00.760 --> 2:50:04.520]  so be it i've talked to people who are like that you know if you say if you don't have anything
[2:50:04.520 --> 2:50:08.360]  to hide then what are you afraid of why are you afraid of them listening to your telephone
[2:50:08.360 --> 2:50:11.720]  conversation well you know it's a simple matter of privacy
[2:50:12.440 --> 2:50:18.200]  and it's indicated in every single amendment that we have uh... in the bill of rights
[2:50:18.200 --> 2:50:23.720]  you know the right to privacy is at least insinuated in all of us so we're talking about
[2:50:23.720 --> 2:50:27.800]  being secure in our persons and property yet we're not anymore because they just do whatever

[2:52:05.320 --> 2:52:10.760]  buy food our administration refuses to limit exports so the food is going to come from america
[2:52:11.320 --> 2:52:15.160]  other countries are already buying all our food they can get at any price
[2:52:15.160 --> 2:52:21.080]  farm organizations are trying to stop greedy commodity investors from buying up all our food
[2:52:21.080 --> 2:52:26.280]  grocery stores are rationing flour rice cooking oil and soon to be corn

[2:52:52.040 --> 2:52:57.480]  alkaline environment but as you know most people are overly acidic due to stress acidic diet and
[2:52:57.480 --> 2:53:02.520]  lack of exercise ph balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health as well
[2:53:02.520 --> 2:53:07.080]  as prevention of disease people who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized
[2:53:07.080 --> 2:53:12.360]  blood sugar mental clarity and loss of weight it was intended for human beings to drink alkaline
[2:53:12.360 --> 2:53:17.720]  water but due to modern way of life most people are overly acidic the fact is that disease simply
[2:53:17.720 --> 2:53:22.040]  cannot exist in an alkaline environment fat accumulates if a person consumes too much
[2:53:22.040 --> 2:53:27.800]  acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it do your part alkalize and supercharge your body
[2:53:27.800 --> 2:53:33.720]  now alcovision plasma ph drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the ph of

[2:53:57.080 --> 2:54:05.080]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network all right we're back i'm jason bermas i'm in for alex
[2:54:05.080 --> 2:54:09.720]  jones we're with william lewis the writer and director of washington you're fired you can pick
[2:54:09.720 --> 2:54:14.360]  that up over at info wars dot com i mean he covers it all folks you know from hurricane
[2:54:14.360 --> 2:54:20.920]  katrina to that to the uh... nsa to uh... the illegal uh... fiza warrants he's got bob bowman
[2:54:20.920 --> 2:54:27.320]  in this picture he's got iraqi veterans and a slew of others um william you you probably say this
[2:54:27.320 --> 2:54:34.920]  is your best film to date yeah i mean it's turning out that way um you know for a long time there it
[2:54:34.920 --> 2:54:40.680]  was uh in plain sight of course i mean it was literally shot in my basement and not very much
[2:54:40.680 --> 2:54:44.200]  thought put into production or script i mean david i would just talk about the script back and
[2:54:44.200 --> 2:54:49.400]  forth at each other and then turn the camera on you know that was it uh this one was actually
[2:54:49.400 --> 2:54:53.560]  scripted out and planned over to your period we have the footage to support all of this and
[2:54:53.560 --> 2:54:59.160]  just a great soundtrack to go with it and it's it's a motivational piece you know it's it's not a
[2:54:59.160 --> 2:55:02.440]  it's not designed to scare people to death although i'm sure you'll find some of the things
[2:55:02.440 --> 2:55:07.160]  and they're very shocking it's designed to motivate people to get back into the political process
[2:55:07.880 --> 2:55:13.480]  and you know i'm hoping that it's doing its job i mean have you seen it yet i've only seen parts
[2:55:13.480 --> 2:55:17.640]  i actually watched uh some of the tasing parts last night and i went through some of the previews
[2:55:17.640 --> 2:55:23.240]  but yeah i did notice that it was really a go out there and uh and get moving and that's what we
[2:55:23.240 --> 2:55:27.400]  need you know that's why i love organizations like we are changed so much is because you know
[2:55:27.400 --> 2:55:31.160]  they're not just paying lip service they're not just doing a radio show like i'm doing now they're
[2:55:31.160 --> 2:55:35.880]  not just on the message boards they're outside on the streets trying to convert those who have no
[2:55:35.880 --> 2:55:40.920]  idea about this information and that's why movies like yours are such great tools because you know
[2:55:40.920 --> 2:55:44.840]  you go out you get a copy you make other copies you share them with your friends and family you
[2:55:44.840 --> 2:55:49.880]  host uh dinner parties and you show them this information and maybe you can turn the light on
[2:55:49.880 --> 2:55:55.800]  in a mind that hasn't been awoken yet that's right and um you know we're finding uh television
[2:55:55.800 --> 2:56:00.920]  stations are more receptive to this one than they have been in the past two other projects not very
[2:56:00.920 --> 2:56:06.680]  much conspiracy on this one guys i mean it's just it's in your face point blank fact that this is the
[2:56:06.680 --> 2:56:12.040]  bill this is what the bill does and if you don't do anything except sit on the couch for the next
[2:56:12.040 --> 2:56:16.680]  you know two years this is what's going to happen and uh this is you know why it's so important
[2:56:16.680 --> 2:56:21.240]  that we get involved in our political process and you know that that goes back to what we
[2:56:21.240 --> 2:56:24.840]  were talking about before i'm not telling people to just drop everything you're doing and run for
[2:56:24.840 --> 2:56:31.000]  congress um start with your local city and state i mean though there's plenty of government positions
[2:56:31.640 --> 2:56:37.000]  plenty of uh you know elected positions for you to run for that will affect change in your area
[2:56:37.000 --> 2:56:42.120]  you know you want to stop cops from tasering people that's not going to start in washington
[2:56:42.120 --> 2:56:46.520]  that's going to start in your community right absolutely absolutely all right let's start
[2:56:46.520 --> 2:56:49.960]  taking some calls let's take uh justin over in texas justin are you with us
[2:56:49.960 --> 2:56:57.240]  no do we not have justin yeah i'm here i was uh i was calling to uh ask mr lewis a question sure
[2:56:57.960 --> 2:57:03.000]  uh yeah this question uh william lewis is uh so off of something i got off the internet basically
[2:57:03.000 --> 2:57:09.240]  the it's a quote and it has to do with journalistic integrity um it says that um i'll be the first to
[2:57:09.240 --> 2:57:14.200]  admit loose change definitely contains errors and still contains some dubious claims and definitely
[2:57:14.200 --> 2:57:18.840]  does come to conclusions that are not totally backed by facts loose change is not a fair
[2:57:18.840 --> 2:57:23.800]  representation of the nine eleven truth movement i would recommend nine eleven press for truth that's
[2:57:23.800 --> 2:57:29.080]  not really loose that's that's still an avery that i was i was talking about and if someone who
[2:57:29.080 --> 2:57:33.960]  made the movie loose change has such a low opinion of it i was wondering how mr lewis would expect
[2:57:33.960 --> 2:57:39.080]  um or what you think people should expect from movies like loose change who claim to be a part
[2:57:39.080 --> 2:57:43.400]  of the truth movement when actually they have no uh facts backing them up hold on hold on guy i know
[2:57:43.400 --> 2:57:49.080]  you call in every time that i do the show now and no facts to back it up uh uh what are you on dude
[2:57:49.080 --> 2:57:53.880]  i mean i don't know hold on i'm gonna keep you on for a second what where is it you name one claim
[2:57:53.880 --> 2:57:57.960]  hold on hold on i'm gonna give you a chance to talk you name one claim that's not backed up do it
[2:57:57.960 --> 2:58:03.640]  okay that uh that that todd beamer didn't die on flight 93 when it's not a movie dude you tell me
[2:58:03.640 --> 2:58:07.640]  where that says that todd beamer didn't die that's so ridiculous all right i'm gonna have to let you
[2:58:07.640 --> 2:58:11.240]  go uh you know william lewis is with william will you hang with me for five more minutes on the other
[2:58:11.240 --> 2:58:15.720]  side sure all right thanks man i appreciate it it's the alex joe and show we're gonna be back

[2:59:30.280 --> 2:59:34.360]  burn the info bombs to disk put them on the file sharing networks
[2:59:34.360 --> 2:59:37.560]  bring down the new world order prisonplanet.tv
[2:59:40.760 --> 2:59:46.040]  waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio networks
[2:59:51.960 --> 3:00:01.000]  government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the gcm radio network
[3:00:01.000 --> 3:00:08.760]  and now live from austin texas alex jones all right we are back and i just i have to address that
[3:00:08.760 --> 3:00:13.000]  last caller because again he's calling in every time that i do the show every time i'm sitting in
[3:00:13.000 --> 3:00:18.520]  with alex and he just created a straw man argument out of nowhere he claims that we said that todd
[3:00:18.520 --> 3:00:24.920]  beamer didn't die never in any of our movies did we say that todd beamer didn't die if you look at
[3:00:24.920 --> 3:00:30.120]  loose change second edition uh and loose change final cut you'll see that there is ample evidence
[3:00:30.120 --> 3:00:34.840]  that no plane crashed in an open field in shanksville pennsylvania okay there would have been
[3:00:34.840 --> 3:00:38.440]  engines there would have been fuselage there would have been body parts okay we went and
[3:00:38.440 --> 3:00:42.680]  interviewed the mayor of indian lake and the only reason he thought that a plane had crashed
[3:00:42.680 --> 3:00:46.920]  there is because that's what the fbi told him he didn't see any plane parts neither did uh
[3:00:46.920 --> 3:00:50.920]  ernie stole of shanksville pennsylvania so if you're gonna come on the show and you're gonna
[3:00:50.920 --> 3:00:56.040]  make some kind of outlandish claim that we said that todd beamer's not dead which we didn't do
[3:00:56.040 --> 3:01:01.160]  you better back it up and this guy calls in and he's just a smarmy know-it-all uh you know
[3:01:01.160 --> 3:01:06.680]  william what's what's your take on people like that i like to talk to people like that personally
[3:01:06.680 --> 3:01:13.160]  so do i i don't want everyone to agree with what i have to say um and and honestly i'm a a debate
[3:01:13.160 --> 3:01:18.120]  or i like to get on and talk about the issues but this this issue of uh you know these types of
[3:01:18.120 --> 3:01:21.560]  documentaries not being a part of the truth movement because they don't present the right
[3:01:21.560 --> 3:01:26.760]  kind of evidence there is no right kind of evidence or wrong kind of evidence there has
[3:01:26.760 --> 3:01:33.400]  been no judge that has looked at this evidence there's been no trial no jury no you know the
[3:01:33.400 --> 3:01:38.600]  the system that you would expect to be in place to examine the evidence for trial it hadn't happened
[3:01:38.600 --> 3:01:45.560]  so until that point in time when it does happen we have to treat all evidence equally and this
[3:01:45.560 --> 3:01:49.720]  guy what this guy's saying is that uh and i've heard people out there say this before you know
[3:01:49.720 --> 3:01:54.120]  you can't talk about the flash you can't talk about the pod you can't talk about you know
[3:01:54.120 --> 3:01:58.200]  things of that nature maybe lasers that were pointed at the building and stuff like that i mean
[3:01:58.200 --> 3:02:02.760]  in my personal opinion right now is that the video and photographic evidence is some of the most
[3:02:03.400 --> 3:02:07.080]  damning evidence that we have against the government and it should be used and it should be
[3:02:07.880 --> 3:02:11.480]  should be seen by people to let them make up their own mind no i agree with you there and
[3:02:11.480 --> 3:02:17.640]  you know one of my big things is when people bring up a quote unquote flight 175 i i say look
[3:02:17.640 --> 3:02:22.760]  you know we have five different angles of this plane hitting the building the flash is obviously
[3:02:22.760 --> 3:02:27.080]  there i'm not saying one way or another what it is or what's causing it but if you look at the
[3:02:27.080 --> 3:02:33.160]  underside of that plane it's a gray underside okay with two gray engines now the united plane that
[3:02:33.160 --> 3:02:37.720]  struck the building is supposed to have a blue underside and two blue engines i fly united
[3:02:37.720 --> 3:02:42.120]  i've seen the plane they claimed uh you know hit the building and it doesn't have that in i think
[3:02:42.120 --> 3:02:46.600]  six or seven of the videos that that clearly show the underside the only markings i can
[3:02:46.600 --> 3:02:52.040]  ever see on that plane is possibly the united logo on the tail but it still doesn't explain why a
[3:02:52.040 --> 3:02:56.040]  gray plane hit that building so you know i'm one of those guys that that always takes that into
[3:02:56.040 --> 3:03:00.920]  consideration i don't like to smear other people because they cover you know certain uh you know
[3:03:00.920 --> 3:03:05.480]  aspects of 9 11 truth what really gets me are the people that are really just out there to
[3:03:05.480 --> 3:03:10.200]  provocateur the situation the people that try to say no planes hit the buildings or space beams
[3:03:10.200 --> 3:03:17.080]  took down the towers or that reptilian jews who drink blood run everything you know those and i
[3:03:17.080 --> 3:03:21.960]  know you come across those people because i come across those people you know well yeah yeah yeah
[3:03:21.960 --> 3:03:27.160]  everything's worth discussing i suppose but um you know it's it's like you pointed out uh it's
[3:03:27.880 --> 3:03:31.880]  you know these are strawman arguments a lot of times people don't even have all their facts
[3:03:31.880 --> 3:03:35.880]  together when they call you up to talk about these things so absolutely all right let's try

[3:08:18.920 --> 3:08:25.160]  to uh iran spencer iran thank you so much for coming on thank you for having me well why don't
[3:08:25.160 --> 3:08:29.640]  you just uh you know i'm reading over your your bio here uh but why don't you just basically tell
[3:08:29.640 --> 3:08:36.280]  your story for the audience well i was born in salt lake city in 1937 and at the time that i
[3:08:36.280 --> 3:08:43.080]  was born i was the 13th of my father's 31 children and he had four wives living in the same house at
[3:08:43.080 --> 3:08:48.280]  the time so here you're lost in the shuffle of all these little children and i grew up all my
[3:08:48.280 --> 3:08:54.920]  life in polygamy uh we more or less hid under the radar trying to not let people know who we were
[3:08:54.920 --> 3:09:03.800]  and we had to lie about who our father was in 1944 uh utah rated uh the polygamous and my dad along
[3:09:03.800 --> 3:09:10.680]  with uh some other men uh spent over two years in youth talk you talk state prisons for polygamy
[3:09:10.680 --> 3:09:17.960]  so when i saw all these women and children being busped uh and taken out just with their javu to
[3:09:17.960 --> 3:09:26.120]  me because in 1953 they uh governor pile rated uh uh short creek arizona which is now known as
[3:09:26.120 --> 3:09:32.680]  colorado city that's the flgs and they bust uh some of my family and sister-in-law and
[3:09:32.680 --> 3:09:39.480]  cousins and people bust them off and uh tried to relocate them but people have to understand
[3:09:39.480 --> 3:09:45.800]  there's between 50 and 80 thousand they're more polygamous in the western united states
[3:09:45.800 --> 3:09:52.920]  canada in mexico and it is very well and alive today now when that happened when uh when the
[3:09:52.920 --> 3:09:58.200]  raid happened to you when you were just a child did they go through uh due process in other words
[3:09:58.200 --> 3:10:04.760]  they serve warrants or i mean what was what was the situation like well i was too young i'm sure
[3:10:04.760 --> 3:10:11.640]  they did that they served warrants and uh came they got them all for illegal cohabitation and a lot
[3:10:11.640 --> 3:10:18.360]  of the man had very young wives and so he became the norm for people not to even register their
[3:10:18.360 --> 3:10:25.400]  children and i myself had a different man's name on my birth certificate so that uh they would not
[3:10:25.400 --> 3:10:33.480]  know who my father was and that's what happened in this flgs uh group in uh uh texas they too
[3:10:34.040 --> 3:10:39.720]  that's what helped them victim when they saw girls as the 15 years old that were uh and on the
[3:10:39.720 --> 3:10:45.160]  fathers they were 65 years old so rather than incriminate them they have done away with having
[3:10:45.160 --> 3:10:50.760]  birth certificates absolutely and and i would say that you know just from reading this it feels like
[3:10:50.760 --> 3:10:57.320]  you know these these polygamous sex use a sort of mind control to uh to keep you there uh you
[3:10:57.320 --> 3:11:05.000]  know the life yeah go ahead it absolutely is mind control i am from five generations of polygamy
[3:11:05.000 --> 3:11:10.040]  and my grandmother was a second wife my mother was a second wife and neither of them ever spoke
[3:11:10.040 --> 3:11:16.440]  out against anything so of course i didn't and when i was 16 i followed in my mother's footsteps
[3:11:16.440 --> 3:11:23.480]  and i too married my sister's husband as my mother had done and in polygamy they married
[3:11:23.480 --> 3:11:29.240]  sisters and cousins and your best friends so that they can take you to heaven because that's what
[3:11:29.240 --> 3:11:34.120]  keeps people there the brainwashing they're told that the man will become a god he will have his
[3:11:34.120 --> 3:11:39.720]  own world and he will take all these wives and these children with him and they make a promise
[3:11:39.720 --> 3:11:44.040]  to the women that they'll have a baby every year that they won't let a year go by without having one
[3:11:44.040 --> 3:11:51.240]  and the average polygamous woman has a dozen children i know many many of them have 18 19
[3:11:51.240 --> 3:11:59.400]  21 and 22 children and uh the i say that the women are just the breeding stocks that keep
[3:11:59.400 --> 3:12:07.800]  these movements expanding and alive and the flbs one in uh uh texas and arizona they actually
[3:12:07.800 --> 3:12:13.080]  marry the girls off they place them they cannot court anybody they marry who the prophet says
[3:12:13.080 --> 3:12:19.240]  for them to marry and i have nieces and nephews in there one niece of mine was married to a man
[3:12:19.240 --> 3:12:25.240]  older than her own father when she was 17 and i've had nephews that have been run out of there
[3:12:25.240 --> 3:12:31.560]  one for not cutting his hair but they run the boys out there's been a documented over 400 of them
[3:12:32.440 --> 3:12:37.720]  by a fellow in salt lake and dan fisher and he's trying to find homes and education for these young
[3:12:37.720 --> 3:12:44.200]  boys but uh i know because they're my nieces and nephews well i would say that you know
[3:12:44.200 --> 3:12:49.240]  obviously uh myself and my listeners absolutely agree with you that you know these are far from
[3:12:49.240 --> 3:12:55.720]  ideal situations for any uh youth to be put into but but what really troubles me about this uh this
[3:12:55.720 --> 3:13:01.880]  texas sect raid is that they did not use due process now you know if this stuff is going on
[3:13:01.880 --> 3:13:06.840]  which it certainly does seem to be why do you think it is that they don't go through the court
[3:13:06.840 --> 3:13:11.400]  system they don't serve a warrant um i mean kenny do you think it's because these people would be
[3:13:11.400 --> 3:13:17.880]  able to get away or why is it that they just go in and take them i personally do not know why the
[3:13:17.880 --> 3:13:23.000]  government has done it but it actually frightens me because i think that later on people come in
[3:13:23.000 --> 3:13:28.200]  and do anything with your families and and anything we have to have due process and they
[3:13:28.200 --> 3:13:36.200]  say the telephone call wasn't even made by someone from the inside but uh if there is child abuse
[3:13:36.200 --> 3:13:41.640]  then it needs to be taken care of but i am against them coming in and taking the children away and
[3:13:41.640 --> 3:13:47.720]  i'll tell you why all of us including me for years were taught that the outside world was wicked
[3:13:47.720 --> 3:13:52.440]  they were out to get us to kill us that satan was going to destroy us and when you take these
[3:13:52.440 --> 3:13:57.800]  little children have been taught that all their life and put them in these foster homes i think
[3:13:57.800 --> 3:14:05.640]  they are terrified and i still have uh the pain and the memories of me when i was a child
[3:14:05.640 --> 3:14:10.920]  having that fear of being torn away and that these mothers are good mothers they love their
[3:14:10.920 --> 3:14:17.800]  children and i i myself had the 13 of my husband's 58 children my husband had 10 wives at the same
[3:14:17.800 --> 3:14:23.720]  time and uh uh i just can't imagine having my children torn for me and what you guys need to
[3:14:23.720 --> 3:14:29.720]  realize is both children are the only thing these women have they have been given to a man whether
[3:14:29.720 --> 3:14:34.200]  they want to marry him or not because they feel as god's will and their children are all they have
[3:14:34.200 --> 3:14:39.720]  and and i think it's wrong the main thing that frightens me is in my own case i have had nine
[3:14:40.280 --> 3:14:46.360]  nieces and nephews and one first cousin that committed suicide and i am afraid that these
[3:14:46.360 --> 3:14:50.600]  that's going to be a very prevalent in this group before very long because they're going
[3:14:50.600 --> 3:14:54.840]  to figure that they have gone to hell well i'm glad that we're on the same page there
[3:14:54.840 --> 3:15:01.160]  what would you like to see happen to the uh the wives and the children i think what needs to be
[3:15:01.160 --> 3:15:08.840]  done is that they need to have uh uh some input get some good psychologists and people that can
[3:15:08.840 --> 3:15:14.600]  talk to them and make them realize that there is another way i was born and i can only say because
[3:15:14.600 --> 3:15:19.080]  i've been there and done that but you're told that you either live polygamy or you go straight to
[3:15:19.080 --> 3:15:24.360]  hell so they make you sacrifice and do it and one thing that people don't realize is that uh
[3:15:24.360 --> 3:15:29.960]  Brigham Young said that when the saints cease to be persecuted that you would know that they were
[3:15:29.960 --> 3:15:35.960]  no longer following the rules of god and so these people when they're being persecuted like this it
[3:15:35.960 --> 3:15:40.440]  just makes them all the more determined to carry on and do what they're doing because
[3:15:40.440 --> 3:15:45.240]  they're saying to themselves this verifies that we're god's children you know yeah it reinforces
[3:15:45.240 --> 3:15:49.880]  their beliefs that they've been taught absolutely but the main thing the main thing either with
[3:15:49.880 --> 3:15:55.080]  my own children uh when my husband had 58 kids and all these wives my kids went out when they're
[3:15:55.080 --> 3:16:00.760]  15 years old just like every other polygamous in these various splinter groups they go out and
[3:16:00.760 --> 3:16:07.800]  work in uh uh you know as contractors you're building homes and all this and they give their
[3:16:07.800 --> 3:16:13.640]  money to their fathers so they can marry younger and more wives and they lose their childhoods
[3:16:13.640 --> 3:16:17.640]  and the same way with the girls the girls from the time they're five year old they're 10 and
[3:16:17.640 --> 3:16:22.760]  baby changing diapers just trying to help their mother's cope and baking bread and washing and
[3:16:22.760 --> 3:16:27.960]  doing it and they lose their childhood and then when they're so young they marry them off but
[3:16:27.960 --> 3:16:34.360]  I myself didn't even have a driver's license until I was 40 years old and even today I want you
[3:16:34.360 --> 3:16:40.120]  to know how deep the brainwashing goes I have been out of this life for 24 years but I still
[3:16:40.120 --> 3:16:45.640]  every once in a while even when they pick these people up in Texas I kind of got a panic attack
[3:16:45.640 --> 3:16:51.240]  one morning thinking the old records in my tapes in my mind saying Irene you're betraying the brethren
[3:16:51.240 --> 3:16:54.840]  uh you know these guys are probably going to jail you're going to be held accountable you
[3:16:54.840 --> 3:16:59.560]  don't know the old tapes go through my mind so I want to tell you you can get out of it
[3:16:59.560 --> 3:17:05.400]  that the brainwashing never gets out of you completely well yeah I mean I'm just really
[3:17:05.400 --> 3:17:11.080]  really concerned uh you know that they're not following a due process and that they will use
[3:17:11.080 --> 3:17:16.920]  this to to go after quote unquote normal families obviously if there's abuse going on it needs to
[3:17:16.920 --> 3:17:22.520]  be dealt with but as you said you know these moms are probably good mothers that love their children
[3:17:22.520 --> 3:17:26.520]  and it looks like there's no way around the fact that they're going to be separated permanently
[3:17:26.520 --> 3:17:30.600]  that these kids are going to be put into foster homes and just grow up with another family
[3:17:31.720 --> 3:17:37.400]  well I've heard some pretty bad stories about foster care too and children that are abused so
[3:17:37.400 --> 3:17:41.160]  they're not going to really get out of it but I do feel like that they should stay with their
[3:17:41.160 --> 3:17:45.640]  mothers it's the only thing they have and they are good people but I do feel that they need to have
[3:17:45.640 --> 3:17:52.040]  some kind of like I say a wake-up call for these people knowing that they're not going to go to
[3:17:52.040 --> 3:17:58.520]  hell you know unless they live this and it's really sad because many of these men have 30 40 50 wives
[3:17:58.520 --> 3:18:04.920]  and hundreds of children and and uh it's just growing and growing and they haven't done anything
[3:18:04.920 --> 3:18:11.000]  in the last 150 years with all their raids and and putting men in prison the thing is just expanded
[3:18:11.000 --> 3:18:17.240]  and growing bigger every day but if we're going to allow this to happen in America uh you know we
[3:18:17.240 --> 3:18:22.280]  could have another Hitler on our hands I mean you know coming in and and you know doing what they
[3:18:22.280 --> 3:18:27.480]  did and I I'm fearful of the government to step overstepping their bounds absolutely I mean look
[3:18:27.480 --> 3:18:32.360]  what they did at Waco you know supposedly they were there to help the women and children uh and
[3:18:32.360 --> 3:18:36.680]  then they killed all those women and children I mean uh you know Waco rules of engagement
[3:18:36.680 --> 3:18:41.960]  exposed that so how are you helping you know these kids inside when you're firing upon them
[3:18:41.960 --> 3:18:46.920]  and you eventually run a tank into the building and set fire to it absolutely I was so much against
[3:18:46.920 --> 3:18:51.640]  that I tell you I said bitter tears to think that the government would do something like that to all
[3:18:51.640 --> 3:18:55.800]  these innocent people they say that they were trying to help and I don't want another thing
[3:18:55.800 --> 3:19:01.320]  like that to happen here but like I say these people have been so indoctrinated and I just hope
[3:19:01.320 --> 3:19:06.840]  that uh they don't turn to suicide or figure that they're out there with the devil's people and all
[3:19:06.840 --> 3:19:11.320]  of them are dressed the way they dress if they go into foster homes and they take their clothes
[3:19:11.320 --> 3:19:15.320]  and make them dress other ways they'll just know that they've gone to hell for sure and

[3:24:48.280 --> 3:24:54.440]  to the alamo draft house to see that we're with uh iran spencer uh the author of shattered dreams
[3:24:54.440 --> 3:24:59.480]  in a woman who actually escaped one of these polygamous camps uh way back in the day and has
[3:24:59.480 --> 3:25:05.000]  been uh railing against it ever ever since i mean a mother of many uh part part of this thing
[3:25:05.000 --> 3:25:10.280]  oh what was it that uh that got you just to to get away i read that it was eventually the uh the
[3:25:10.280 --> 3:25:14.520]  death of your husband but when did you start rethinking the entire thing well i started
[3:25:14.520 --> 3:25:19.800]  reaching thinking at uh uh quite a while before when i saw my nieces and nephews and people
[3:25:19.800 --> 3:25:24.520]  commit suicide and and people have nervous breakdowns and all the thing that happened i knew that
[3:25:24.520 --> 3:25:31.080]  something was not right and i'm i'm happy to say that since i have written shattered dreams i've had
[3:25:31.080 --> 3:25:37.080]  polygamous women and men that have come out of the woodwork and emailed me and said i read
[3:25:37.080 --> 3:25:41.880]  especially the women they say you said everything that i always wanted to say and never felt that
[3:25:41.880 --> 3:25:47.960]  i could and i've actually had uh polygamous wives that have left their husband and i've had men
[3:25:47.960 --> 3:25:54.040]  that have lived polygamy that have had born their hearts you know just tell me what a hard life it
[3:25:54.040 --> 3:25:58.200]  was and one thing another but anyway i feel that it's just getting the knowledge out there and
[3:25:58.200 --> 3:26:03.720]  letting people know that that there is life after polygamy and earlier you mentioned you know
[3:26:03.720 --> 3:26:08.280]  that how you were against waco and you were worried you know without due process we might have
[3:26:08.280 --> 3:26:12.520]  you know another hitler type situation where they just used that excuse to come into your home
[3:26:12.520 --> 3:26:19.480]  and take your family no matter what what are your opinions of the current administration well i don't
[3:26:19.480 --> 3:26:25.160]  know so much about administration except i mean i'm not into politics and government so much but
[3:26:25.160 --> 3:26:30.440]  i just know that anytime that any government oversteps their bounds and like i say i have been
[3:26:30.440 --> 3:26:35.160]  worried because of what happened to waco and other situations and i think that these people
[3:26:35.160 --> 3:26:41.800]  no matter what need to have their uh rights respected and if they are guilty uh you know i can
[3:26:41.800 --> 3:26:47.240]  see something going into another town i mean it wouldn't happen in another town because one girl
[3:26:47.240 --> 3:26:51.400]  called and said something going to hold down and raise the whole town and pull people out i mean
[3:26:51.400 --> 3:26:56.200]  it's kind of far-fetched you know yeah it seems more than extreme and i've seen these women on
[3:26:56.200 --> 3:27:02.440]  larry king live and other programs and yeah you know obviously they have a a line of talking points
[3:27:02.440 --> 3:27:08.200]  what they feel like they can and cannot say but they also genuinely seem to want their children back
[3:27:08.200 --> 3:27:13.240]  and and are saying look there aren't abuses going on if there are abuses going down on let's let's
[3:27:13.240 --> 3:27:18.120]  handle in a legal manner you know service with papers you know give us a chance to see our
[3:27:18.120 --> 3:27:22.040]  children again and you know basically they were put on a bus and their children were put on a
[3:27:22.040 --> 3:27:25.880]  separate bus and they were told that you know they were going to be able to see their families
[3:27:25.880 --> 3:27:30.440]  you know after the processing and then they were never given back yeah i think it's absolutely
[3:27:30.440 --> 3:27:35.960]  wrong i think the government's kind of about it the wrong way and my heart doesn't really go out
[3:27:35.960 --> 3:27:41.240]  to those people because they are good people they're trying to raise good families and they have this
[3:27:41.240 --> 3:27:46.360]  religion something has been going on for all these generations and something that you know they're
[3:27:46.360 --> 3:27:51.320]  just not going to give up that easy but people don't realize how fast these people produce
[3:27:51.320 --> 3:27:59.960]  i myself have 121 grandchildren and last week i had my 59th great-grandchild and that's just for
[3:27:59.960 --> 3:28:05.560]  my that's just for my children and that might have been at 58 children another brother had 56
[3:28:05.560 --> 3:28:13.480]  another 47 and on and on and on so you can see that from one family how fast this that movement
[3:28:13.480 --> 3:28:18.760]  is growing absolutely and if you want to check out her book you can go to iran spencer books
[3:28:18.760 --> 3:28:23.400]  dot com to see shattered dreams and others do you do you have other works out there i have just
[3:28:23.400 --> 3:28:30.200]  sold my second book and it's called cult insanity polygamy prophets and blood atonement and it'll
[3:28:30.200 --> 3:28:36.680]  be out in may of 09 interesting stuff interesting stuff so again you know how does this situation
[3:28:36.680 --> 3:28:42.520]  end it almost seems to me like i would like a person like yourself to go and talk to at least
[3:28:42.520 --> 3:28:47.640]  the children that are being detained and try to give them an overview of what you know outside
[3:28:47.640 --> 3:28:52.520]  life is like but then on the other end you know that they may want to hook back up with their
[3:28:52.520 --> 3:28:55.880]  their mother maybe not their father again i don't know what's going on in these homes
[3:28:55.880 --> 3:29:01.400]  you know to try to have that separate type of family well you know my first cousin her name
[3:29:01.400 --> 3:29:06.680]  is christin decker she just barely went down there to try to see her sister who is my first
[3:29:06.680 --> 3:29:11.800]  cousin also and tried to get to see her and they would not allow her to and she actually was in
[3:29:11.800 --> 3:29:17.000]  people magazine last week people magazine about her trip down there that they won't even allow
[3:29:17.000 --> 3:29:22.200]  they just came to the gate and she told them who she was it's criminal hey she's okay it's criminal
[3:29:22.200 --> 3:29:25.880]  i mean i thank you so much for being on the show shattered dreams is the book will be back

[3:33:55.320 --> 3:34:00.120]  now addressing a greg he was talking about uh... a lot of the fighter jets that morning and how
[3:34:00.120 --> 3:34:04.840]  they have fighter jets throughout the world or or throughout the country uh... maned and ready to go
[3:34:04.840 --> 3:34:09.640]  well that morning they're running or gel northern vigilance vigilant guardian global guardian
[3:34:09.640 --> 3:34:15.320]  and in fact we only had about 14 fighter jets in the uh... continental united states of america
[3:34:15.320 --> 3:34:19.880]  the other ones were flown out by uh... alaskan airspace russian airspace
[3:34:19.880 --> 3:34:24.520]  and in this mass drill now if you listen to some of the uh...
[3:34:24.520 --> 3:34:29.960]  audio tapes from norad that are now publicly i think they released them last month for the
[3:34:29.960 --> 3:34:35.960]  public you get the mp3's or the way files whatever you listen to those
[3:34:35.960 --> 3:34:39.880]  and you find out well look look at all these other hijackings they're having
[3:34:39.880 --> 3:34:44.280]  oh wait a minute of these are guys are running drills like like literally these guys in f16s
[3:34:44.280 --> 3:34:48.120]  are are wiring back and they're like oh yeah we're running a drill can we come back and land now
[3:34:48.760 --> 3:34:53.320]  so you know that's probably how they crippled air defenses that morning and then they covered up
[3:34:53.320 --> 3:34:59.080]  you know what we're what went on by uh... destroying those f a a tapes and the f a a had little to
[3:34:59.080 --> 3:35:03.960]  no say in the nine eleven commission i know because i have the hearing uh... that's the hearing
[3:35:03.960 --> 3:35:08.840]  with uh... i think it's ever hearts there uh... mires is there and then they go through and they
[3:35:08.840 --> 3:35:13.320]  have the head of the f a a and he he's pretty vocal but they don't let him talk much he basically
[3:35:13.320 --> 3:35:17.720]  says look there were hijacking procedures we follow those anything else is ludicrous and
[3:35:17.720 --> 3:35:21.880]  they just don't let him speak up he also uh... revealed the fact that there were two military
[3:35:21.880 --> 3:35:26.360]  men in the room at all times while the f a a was going through this whole crisis
[3:35:26.360 --> 3:35:32.600]  so you know the info is out there i'm just uh... telling y'all to go check it out a great place
[3:35:32.600 --> 3:35:38.040]  to check it out is info wars dot com prison planet dot com truth news dot us and of course
[3:35:38.040 --> 3:35:41.880]  jones report dot com and that's just only a few of the websites that uh...
[3:35:41.880 --> 3:35:43.880]  alex and the good people over here maintain
[3:35:44.680 --> 3:35:49.240]  all right let's take uh... our first caller let's take joe from nevada joey with me
[3:35:49.240 --> 3:35:53.240]  hello yes
[3:35:53.240 --> 3:35:54.200]  hi guys
[3:35:54.200 --> 3:35:57.800]  this was the first time i've called i just wanted to say that you guys
[3:35:57.800 --> 3:36:00.520]  you alex everybody guys are my heroes
[3:36:00.520 --> 3:36:02.360]  um... i look up to you guys a lot
[3:36:02.360 --> 3:36:06.280]  i've been in basically involved in the truth movement for about two years
[3:36:07.080 --> 3:36:11.160]  and it's kind of hard to you know you talk to someone about it and either
[3:36:12.040 --> 3:36:13.560]  they don't care
[3:36:13.560 --> 3:36:17.240]  or they're too scared to admit it or they just don't even want to look you know what i mean
[3:36:17.240 --> 3:36:23.720]  mm-hmm it's hard but like my dad for instance he was like a diehard republican you know neocon
[3:36:23.720 --> 3:36:28.520]  type guy and all i did was i brought a couple videos over his house and i showed him uh
[3:36:28.520 --> 3:36:31.320]  terrorist form was the first one and he just
[3:36:32.200 --> 3:36:35.960]  his mind was blown and then all he wanted to do was research i gave him all the websites and
[3:36:35.960 --> 3:36:41.800]  everything and so like he's a he's a real prominent guy in his town he's like the he's a local doctor
[3:36:41.800 --> 3:36:45.960]  and he's got a couple practices and he's big in the church and stuff and he's been talking to all
[3:36:45.960 --> 3:36:48.200]  his patients and all his uh...
[3:36:48.200 --> 3:36:52.120]  fellow churchgoers you know what i mean yeah and that's what we need to do right now like wildfire
[3:36:52.120 --> 3:36:55.320]  you know yeah and that's the way to do it i mean again everybody's not going to be receptive to
[3:36:55.320 --> 3:37:00.200]  this information and i think what's that and and actually looks at it
[3:37:01.080 --> 3:37:06.120]  that it's impossible not to you know it's it's i'd say it's 90 percent impossible
[3:37:06.120 --> 3:37:08.920]  yeah to admit that there's something wrong there's that 10 percent of the population
[3:37:08.920 --> 3:37:13.080]  like that guy that calls into me yeah and and toes the official line no matter what
[3:37:13.080 --> 3:37:17.800]  but if you listen to these guys like uh he quoted dylan uh... from this uh... debate
[3:37:17.800 --> 3:37:21.160]  that myself and dylan had with uh... mark robertson ronald wike
[3:37:21.160 --> 3:37:23.720]  and that's all that yeah and this is a guy
[3:37:23.720 --> 3:37:30.040]  who says that you know oswald killed kennedy all alone and there's no conspiracy about anything
[3:37:30.040 --> 3:37:34.840]  and you'll bring up the is i wire transfer in the oh that was only in the times of india
[3:37:34.840 --> 3:37:40.440]  well you know we've confirmed it with joseph biden uh... bob graham talked about meeting with the guy
[3:37:40.440 --> 3:37:43.880]  there's no doubt that he helped find fun the hijackers the is i
[3:37:43.880 --> 3:37:48.120]  uh... packet pakistani intelligence is so close to u.s intelligence we set them up
[3:37:48.120 --> 3:37:52.040]  you know they were set up we were they were set up as the funding arm of the hijackers
[3:37:52.040 --> 3:37:55.960]  so that we could use pakistan as a launching base to go into afghanistan
[3:37:55.960 --> 3:37:58.280]  that's the bottom line that's what happened there
[3:37:58.280 --> 3:38:02.520]  and you know we need to keep spreading this information one of my tools is that i have
[3:38:02.520 --> 3:38:05.480]  building seven of the video of it coming down on my phone
[3:38:05.480 --> 3:38:08.280]  so if i get into a conversation with somebody i do too
[3:38:08.280 --> 3:38:11.880]  yeah it's the way to go the same thing i do people don't even know that building seven
[3:38:11.880 --> 3:38:14.120]  clocks that they don't know like what's building seven

[3:38:41.640 --> 3:38:47.160]  hello uh... i know of another abusive mind control cult in german texas
[3:38:47.160 --> 3:38:52.360]  and they put up a forum called faith church dot inform me dot com where they detail their
[3:38:52.360 --> 3:38:58.200]  abuse experiences and they're asking for publicity and new members to the forum i thought i might
[3:38:58.200 --> 3:39:03.560]  mention that possible story and just want to thank you for having mrs spencer on and
[3:39:03.560 --> 3:39:07.000]  you know raising awareness about abusive mind control cult
[3:39:07.000 --> 3:39:10.600]  no absolutely and she was excellent you know she even though she acknowledged that
[3:39:10.600 --> 3:39:14.520]  you know these people are abusive and in mind control he she also acknowledged hey
[3:39:14.520 --> 3:39:17.640]  the government shouldn't be overstepping their bounds and they should go to the
[3:39:17.640 --> 3:39:21.000]  the route of due process that's true also heard they're trying to build a road through
[3:39:21.000 --> 3:39:24.840]  that compound maybe that's why they stole their land well they're trying to it's probably why
[3:39:24.840 --> 3:39:29.720]  it's uh... it's a main priority now you know and that and just again creating the precedent
[3:39:29.720 --> 3:39:34.360]  that they can come in without a warrant and take your family away you know and again it's not
[3:39:34.360 --> 3:39:38.360]  like i'm in the league of me yet it is hideous and it's it's disgusting man
[3:39:38.360 --> 3:39:45.160]  i was the website again uh... it's a forum it's a it's faith church dot inform i am
[3:39:45.160 --> 3:39:48.840]  f o r m e dot com all right my form
[3:39:48.840 --> 3:39:53.720]  alright thanks for the call i'll let's shoot to david in missouri david are you with us
[3:39:53.720 --> 3:39:58.200]  hello yes i know i was going to address your last guest
[3:39:58.200 --> 3:40:01.880]  um... i mean i realize that there's abuse
[3:40:01.880 --> 3:40:06.040]  in all cultures and beliefs and that there's going to be problems but what do
[3:40:06.040 --> 3:40:11.160]  you call what they've done to us in public school and to set us down as kids
[3:40:11.160 --> 3:40:15.320]  and throw pornography at us uh... give us riddlin
[3:40:15.320 --> 3:40:19.240]  heroin i mean i i know all kinds of people that have died committed suicide i might
[3:40:19.240 --> 3:40:22.280]  not be related to him if i was in
[3:40:22.280 --> 3:40:27.480]  in um... in that kind of of set up where it was all family i guess you would
[3:40:27.480 --> 3:40:30.760]  but compare the numbers just the people you know
[3:40:30.760 --> 3:40:35.800]  and talk about abuse we as a people have been brainwashed completely
[3:40:35.800 --> 3:40:38.520]  well i'm with you there man i mean especially in the public school
[3:40:38.520 --> 3:40:43.080]  systems that now want to take your dna without any kind of a
[3:40:43.080 --> 3:40:46.280]  permission slip or awareness to your parents uh... they have
[3:40:46.280 --> 3:40:50.600]  cameras all over the schools there's been programs like
[3:40:50.600 --> 3:40:53.960]  dare and others since i was a kid you know there there's no doubt that the
[3:40:53.960 --> 3:40:57.400]  public school system is is totally doing indoctrinates
[3:40:57.400 --> 3:41:01.240]  into uh... you know this this new world order this new age
[3:41:01.240 --> 3:41:05.160]  mentality but you know on the other end i would say that
[3:41:05.160 --> 3:41:08.600]  you know when you when you do have ten or eleven wives and you have fifty or
[3:41:08.600 --> 3:41:11.080]  sixty children and you're brought up a certain way that is
[3:41:11.080 --> 3:41:14.520]  definitely another form of mind control it's different
[3:41:14.520 --> 3:41:17.800]  i mean everybody should be in agreement i don't have any problem with it and i
[3:41:17.800 --> 3:41:21.000]  don't i don't come from play me or anything like that
[3:41:21.000 --> 3:41:23.960]  but i do see the biblical background for it
[3:41:23.960 --> 3:41:27.160]  um... as far as just populate in the earth and uh...
[3:41:27.160 --> 3:41:32.280]  you know what's it's i would say that people like the ones in texas from what
[3:41:32.280 --> 3:41:34.920]  i saw i mean i would ask that person
[3:41:34.920 --> 3:41:40.120]  how many how many thefts and stealing how many incidents of
[3:41:40.120 --> 3:41:44.120]  auto theft or murder do they have in their society
[3:41:44.120 --> 3:41:48.360]  well it's a good point but i i you know i just can't get into uh... you know how
[3:41:48.360 --> 3:41:51.960]  wrapped up they are into the world i i just feel like you know
[3:41:51.960 --> 3:41:55.080]  you know you you you should have free will and a lot of these people
[3:41:55.080 --> 3:41:58.040]  uh... growing up in these types of situations have anything but free will
[3:41:58.040 --> 3:42:02.360]  and less of a chance to uh... attain free will again i'm not endorsing what
[3:42:02.360 --> 3:42:04.680]  they did i mean obviously they shouldn't have been going in there
[3:42:04.680 --> 3:42:08.120]  and taking those kids well i don't know another note
[3:42:08.120 --> 3:42:10.840]  you know these people most of these people and they kind of catch on and
[3:42:10.840 --> 3:42:14.200]  not having birth certificates and license and things like that
[3:42:14.200 --> 3:42:17.640]  which um... as far as the churches go out there as far as a marriage license
[3:42:17.640 --> 3:42:20.200]  you know everybody needs to start asking their self
[3:42:20.200 --> 3:42:24.040]  why would they have a marriage license the state never got permission
[3:42:24.040 --> 3:42:28.440]  over marriage as far as as um... the bible's concern i don't know where they
[3:42:28.440 --> 3:42:32.120]  got it but what you're forming there is a contract it's a social contract it's
[3:42:32.120 --> 3:42:36.360]  a legal agreement and that that gives them a lot of power
[3:42:36.360 --> 3:42:39.720]  i agree with you man i totally agree with you on that point david i thank you
[3:42:39.720 --> 3:42:40.680]  for the call
[3:42:40.680 --> 3:42:44.200]  uh... let's move on to the next caller let's go to uh... michael in south
[3:42:44.200 --> 3:42:46.280]  carolina
[3:42:46.280 --> 3:42:49.000]  hi i don't want to ask you something uh...
[3:42:49.000 --> 3:42:51.000]  what makes you think that we're not already in
[3:42:51.000 --> 3:42:52.200]  marshal law
[3:42:52.200 --> 3:42:55.480]  amongst other things you make a good point in uh...
[3:42:55.480 --> 3:42:59.560]  i wouldn't say that we're not in in marshal all i just say it's not to the
[3:42:59.560 --> 3:43:02.360]  extreme point like it is saying new york city
[3:43:02.360 --> 3:43:03.840]  you know i'm from new york
[3:43:03.840 --> 3:43:06.280]  and i want to say that for the state the first level
[3:43:06.280 --> 3:43:09.400]  well i would say that we would be part of that we might even be past the first
[3:43:09.400 --> 3:43:10.920]  level man
[3:43:10.920 --> 3:43:13.440]  what i consider total and complete marshal law
[3:43:13.440 --> 3:43:16.640]  is when you see first of all the police are the military
[3:43:16.640 --> 3:43:20.240]  okay posi commentatus is completely i agree hundred percent with that
[3:43:20.240 --> 3:43:22.040]  yeah but let's what
[3:43:22.040 --> 3:43:25.520]  what is that a normal person to to do about that
[3:43:25.520 --> 3:43:29.880]  and i'm getting into the end into the question of of marshal law
[3:43:29.880 --> 3:43:33.120]  uh... you're going back two years ago i've been involved in the research
[3:43:33.120 --> 3:43:34.360]  analyst and uh...
[3:43:34.360 --> 3:43:37.680]  what amazes me you pinpoint everything it doesn't matter if the
[3:43:37.680 --> 3:43:41.400]  planes hit the building or not the plane is not what bought
[3:43:41.400 --> 3:43:44.640]  three buildings down at all there's just no way it doesn't matter if the planes
[3:43:44.640 --> 3:43:45.800]  were there or not
[3:43:45.800 --> 3:43:49.600]  they came down demolition style and all the evidence is there
[3:43:49.600 --> 3:43:51.120]  uh... but the point is
[3:43:51.120 --> 3:43:54.560]  and and no one was to get deep except well alex jones
[3:43:54.560 --> 3:43:57.640]  pretty much gets into it
[3:43:57.640 --> 3:44:00.080]  what should be done i think these people are above the law
[3:44:00.080 --> 3:44:03.080]  this luminati group or whatever group they are they're above
[3:44:03.080 --> 3:44:04.840]  the law and what
[3:44:04.840 --> 3:44:08.720]  are you going to do about what well i mean for my steps anyway i mean i'm just
[3:44:08.720 --> 3:44:11.800]  trying to get people to to go to action man i mean
[3:44:11.800 --> 3:44:13.320]  you know my movies
[3:44:13.320 --> 3:44:16.720]  are a way not only to educate people but hopefully motivate people and if you
[3:44:16.720 --> 3:44:19.640]  saw the extras of loose change second edition
[3:44:19.640 --> 3:44:23.200]  you know it's me dylan and quarry in the new york city subway
[3:44:23.200 --> 3:44:26.640]  on nine eleven two thousand five on the on the fourth anniversary
[3:44:26.640 --> 3:44:28.920]  you know putting up flyers all over the place
[3:44:28.920 --> 3:44:32.360]  we had about fifty dvds at that point to go hand out and talk to people
[3:44:32.360 --> 3:44:33.520]  you know the next year
[3:44:33.520 --> 3:44:37.760]  we had two thousand people down there in investigate nine eleven shirts and ten
[3:44:37.760 --> 3:44:41.080]  thousand dvds there's only so much i can do
[3:44:41.080 --> 3:44:44.200]  as as one man you know but together
[3:44:44.200 --> 3:44:45.400]  i feel like a senator
[3:44:45.400 --> 3:44:48.040]  yet senator mike and in my state
[3:44:48.040 --> 3:44:51.800]  are they going to reinvest a nine eleven due to the uh...
[3:44:51.800 --> 3:44:54.480]  outstanding evidence of the of the sulfate
[3:44:54.480 --> 3:44:56.080]  that was found
[3:44:56.080 --> 3:44:59.880]  uh... and she says well we didn't think that was would be necessary
[3:44:59.880 --> 3:45:03.480]  as as as a direction to the defined what
[3:45:03.480 --> 3:45:07.920]  uh... of the overall picture of why the terror struck the two buildings well
[3:45:07.920 --> 3:45:11.600]  if you look at that nist report it's ten thousand pages you believe that i don't
[3:45:11.600 --> 3:45:16.160]  i totally believe it look look we have a nist report of ten thousand pages
[3:45:16.160 --> 3:45:20.320]  they describe of the collapse mechanism quote unquote and then say global
[3:45:20.320 --> 3:45:25.120]  collapse ensues and then when john growths one of the authors of this report
[3:45:25.120 --> 3:45:28.800]  is confronted about it he says well the video speaks for itself so we didn't do
[3:45:28.800 --> 3:45:32.880]  any scientific calculations to find out how the rest of the building fell
[3:45:32.880 --> 3:45:33.960]  and then you look
[3:45:33.960 --> 3:45:35.680]  at their actual tests
[3:45:35.680 --> 3:45:36.800]  okay the floors
[3:45:36.800 --> 3:45:40.040]  were subjected to longer and hotter fires and guess what they didn't collapse
[3:45:40.040 --> 3:45:41.920]  they barely have no doubt about it
[3:45:41.920 --> 3:45:45.640]  and all everybody on this radio station understand that the towers
[3:45:45.640 --> 3:45:48.880]  were detonated they came down and demolition stop there's no doubt about
[3:45:48.880 --> 3:45:49.520]  that
[3:45:49.520 --> 3:45:53.360]  and i mean that and then there's no assumption about it happened
[3:45:53.360 --> 3:45:56.880]  everyone listening out there knows that it happened next step is
[3:45:56.880 --> 3:45:58.120]  what are we going to do
[3:45:58.120 --> 3:46:01.720]  now this is the next step have you ever heard of the iran burst
[3:46:01.720 --> 3:46:02.960]  it's their own
[3:46:02.960 --> 3:46:04.840]  market exchange of oil
[3:46:04.840 --> 3:46:09.920]  no i i'm not quite familiar dot com iran b o u r s e dot com
[3:46:09.920 --> 3:46:14.960]  that will explain everything of why we're going to initiate war with iran
[3:46:14.960 --> 3:46:17.760]  because they sell their oil out in the
[3:46:17.760 --> 3:46:19.680]  international market
[3:46:19.680 --> 3:46:21.960]  and what other whatever country
[3:46:21.960 --> 3:46:24.040]  currency they have
[3:46:24.040 --> 3:46:28.360]  united states has made it mandatory to trade in the u s dollar
[3:46:28.360 --> 3:46:29.760]  iran
[3:46:29.760 --> 3:46:31.680]  is trading with ever whatever
[3:46:31.680 --> 3:46:33.400]  and in international
[3:46:33.400 --> 3:46:36.720]  country wants to buy the oil whether it's in japanese yen
[3:46:36.720 --> 3:46:39.240]  or the euro and of course you know the
[3:46:39.240 --> 3:46:42.200]  domination of the europe president right now so that is
[3:46:42.200 --> 3:46:44.480]  deteriorating the u s economy
[3:46:44.480 --> 3:46:46.880]  now their next game plan
[3:46:46.880 --> 3:46:48.360]  is to go into iran
[3:46:48.360 --> 3:46:52.440]  they have to in order to secure the mid east it's not i don't disagree with you
[3:46:52.440 --> 3:46:55.760]  i mean it's a great place to get resources and it's a great landmass
[3:46:55.760 --> 3:46:56.840]  to really put
[3:46:56.840 --> 3:46:59.240]  a eurasian military presence and
[3:46:59.240 --> 3:47:02.480]  and really i mean saudi arabia's are already our body we took over afghanistan
[3:47:02.480 --> 3:47:03.760]  we've taken over iraq
[3:47:03.760 --> 3:47:07.240]  uh... iran is smack dab in the middle of those countries we already have
[3:47:07.240 --> 3:47:09.960]  uh... dealings with pakistan i mean obviously we're close to their
[3:47:09.960 --> 3:47:11.240]  intelligence apparatus
[3:47:11.240 --> 3:47:14.760]  i i thank you for the call michael uh... we're gonna move move on to
[3:47:14.760 --> 3:47:18.040]  lex in washington lex are you with us

[3:56:29.520 --> 3:56:33.360]  where our dollar for instance was pitted against the euro
[3:56:33.360 --> 3:56:36.560]  and the euro was seventy five cents to our dollar the the euro is now about
[3:56:36.560 --> 3:56:39.440]  about buck forty buck forty one to our dollar all right
[3:56:39.440 --> 3:56:42.640]  we used to live in a country where our dollar
[3:56:42.640 --> 3:56:46.960]  was compared to about eighty cents eighty five cents to canada
[3:56:46.960 --> 3:56:50.240]  our dollar is now below a canadian dollar it's like a dollar one to a dollar
[3:56:50.240 --> 3:56:53.680]  or a dollar ten in fact i know a lot of canadians that no longer will even
[3:56:53.680 --> 3:56:57.760]  accept us federal reserve notes so on that tier
[3:56:57.760 --> 3:57:02.720]  we are now almost equal to canada in fact uh members of the canadian parliament
[3:57:02.720 --> 3:57:06.160]  have proposed that we go on parity with the looney
[3:57:06.160 --> 3:57:09.280]  and the tunie the looney and the tunie are the one and two dollar coins
[3:57:09.280 --> 3:57:12.400]  so in other words a dollar there will be a dollar here
[3:57:12.400 --> 3:57:17.360]  now the peso is is has never been worth a lot
[3:57:17.360 --> 3:57:21.520]  but if we devalue the dollar enough so that it's
[3:57:21.520 --> 3:57:24.560]  close to the peso or almost on par with the peso
[3:57:24.560 --> 3:57:28.400]  then our economic overlords are going to come forward and they're going to say
[3:57:28.400 --> 3:57:32.960]  well you know our our dollar is really close to the canadian dollar and it's
[3:57:32.960 --> 3:57:36.240]  really close to the mexican dollar and we've built this infrastructure it
[3:57:36.240 --> 3:57:40.160]  really makes sense to merge into a new currency just like they did with the
[3:57:40.160 --> 3:57:45.120]  euro man and from that new currency just like the european union started out as
[3:57:45.120 --> 3:57:48.640]  supposedly a trade agreement they're going to build their own constitution
[3:57:48.640 --> 3:57:51.440]  and they're going to have their own laws and rules and regulations and that's
[3:57:51.440 --> 3:57:54.400]  why the spp agreement has happened it's the
