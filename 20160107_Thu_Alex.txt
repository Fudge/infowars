[00:00.000 --> 00:11.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.480 --> 00:19.040]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.040 --> 00:27.440]  Texas Alex Jones it's Thursday 7th day of January 2016 if the speaker of the
[00:27.440 --> 00:31.640]  House will not move immediately to begin impeachment proceedings against
[00:31.640 --> 00:36.960]  Barack Hussein Obama then we must move to impeach the speaker of the House
[00:36.960 --> 00:40.960]  because he's aiding and abetting the enemy of this constitutional republic
[00:40.960 --> 00:47.240]  huge broadcast lined up for you today this is the zeitgeist of impeachment
[00:47.240 --> 00:53.120]  until we have a Congress that's in line with the majority of Americans there
[00:53.120 --> 00:58.120]  are actions within my legal authority that we can take to help reduce gun
[00:58.120 --> 01:03.960]  violence to save more lives roughly one year from now Obama's stranglehold over
[01:03.960 --> 01:08.880]  the executive office of the US government will end impeaching Obama now
[01:08.880 --> 01:13.240]  seems to many to be feudal is it not time for impeachment hearings against
[01:13.240 --> 01:18.000]  Obama the best thing that we have going with Obama is he's got a year left okay
[01:18.000 --> 01:21.520]  because you know by the time you do the hearings and everything I don't so don't
[01:21.520 --> 01:25.120]  make him a martyr in a way you'll make him a martyr but I don't even say that
[01:25.120 --> 01:29.080]  but the problem with the Republicans is they'll try and fix it they'll try
[01:29.080 --> 01:33.960]  instead of get rid of it and we can come up with a phenomenal plan but wouldn't
[01:33.960 --> 01:38.400]  impeaching a president that has toyed with the Constitution with nothing to
[01:38.400 --> 01:43.800]  lose in the final days of his term like a pyromaniac playing with gasoline and
[01:43.800 --> 01:49.520]  matches send a stern message to future presidents as a result of Watergate the
[01:49.520 --> 01:54.200]  warning shot America fired after the comparatively minimal damage Richard
[01:54.200 --> 01:57.880]  Nixon did to the reputation of the White House seems to have been long
[01:57.880 --> 02:02.400]  forgotten similar to the way the American people have all but given up on
[02:02.400 --> 02:07.040]  the US Congress now congressional Republicans are promising to repeal
[02:07.040 --> 02:11.400]  Obamacare and defund Planned Parenthood for the sake of the overwhelming
[02:11.400 --> 02:16.720]  demands of their constituents of course the bill will be sent to Obama's desk
[02:16.720 --> 02:21.600]  where it will be vetoed but the bill can't be amended by Democrats due to
[02:21.600 --> 02:26.400]  special rules attached to it by the Senate and if there is any sanity left
[02:26.400 --> 02:32.240]  in American politics a vote for veto override will be set for January 22nd
[02:32.240 --> 02:37.760]  led by Obama's new lapdog Paul Ryan it appears to be just another elaborate
[02:37.760 --> 02:43.440]  stunt to rejuvenate public support for a Congress that has earned itself an 82%
[02:43.440 --> 02:49.400]  disapproval rating according to Gallup polls while 318 million plus Americans
[02:49.400 --> 02:52.880]  sit and wait for Congress to get their snouts out of the corporate trough
[02:52.880 --> 02:57.960]  wouldn't impeaching Obama send a clear message to the sycophantic takeover of
[02:57.960 --> 03:03.760]  Congress that we are coming for you next Obama's staged gun grabbing is
[03:03.760 --> 03:08.720]  finally fueling long overdue impeachment talks now the Republican
[03:08.720 --> 03:12.520]  National Committee is to consider a resolution drafted for the impeachment
[03:12.520 --> 03:17.200]  of President Barack Obama the resolution which seems to have been drafted by the
[03:17.200 --> 03:22.080]  North American Law Center is to be weighed up at a January 13th meeting of
[03:22.080 --> 03:27.480]  the RNC reports Brandon Hall of West Michigan politics blog the document is
[03:27.480 --> 03:32.600]  titled articles of impeachment of Barack Hussein Obama article 2 of the
[03:32.600 --> 03:38.480]  resolution lists 19 examples of Obama's malfeasance misconduct and abuse of the
[03:38.480 --> 03:42.920]  Oval Office including the IRS targeting of conservative organizations and
[03:42.920 --> 03:47.680]  bypassing Congress with the use of executive action on key issues article
[03:47.680 --> 03:52.280]  three of the resolution states that Obama has been aiding and abetting known
[03:52.280 --> 03:57.840]  enemies of the United States citing the Muslim Brotherhood ISIS al Qaeda Hamas
[03:57.840 --> 04:02.600]  and the Taliban among others RNC committee man Dave Aegema told the
[04:02.600 --> 04:07.280]  Daily Wire in an interview that he will introduce the resolution which consists
[04:07.280 --> 04:13.280]  of 48 criminal charges in total Aegema said the way it works is one House of
[04:13.280 --> 04:16.720]  Representatives member puts in impeachment articles for the House and it
[04:16.720 --> 04:20.520]  starts the process recently we didn't own the House in the Senate but
[04:20.520 --> 04:25.400]  Republicans do now and the purpose of it really is we're a nation of laws and a
[04:25.400 --> 04:30.880]  separation of powers the fact that we have to be reminded of that signals just
[04:30.880 --> 04:36.560]  how far gone the Republic truly is and if impeachment rumblings barely put a
[04:36.560 --> 04:41.440]  bump in Obama's totalitarian path legally all we have left is to send in
[04:41.440 --> 04:46.280]  the Sergeant-at-Arms in the Senate to slap the handcuffs on to President Obama
[04:46.280 --> 04:50.920]  it's interesting how the Senate has now made that information unavailable to the
[04:50.920 --> 04:56.160]  general populace John Bound for info wars.com
[04:57.920 --> 05:02.000]  by now you've heard of the sexual assaults that took place in Cologne

[05:18.560 --> 05:22.840]  abuse forcing coverage German ministers claimed that there was no evidence

[08:36.200 --> 08:44.680]  news to cover and break down there is just so much to get to so much to break
[08:44.680 --> 08:52.400]  down it is head spinning a lot of it is really negative news but overall the
[08:52.400 --> 08:57.200]  world's response to it is very positive in that governments and major
[08:57.200 --> 09:10.280]  corporations are really backpedaling from so many of their their agendas I'm
[09:10.280 --> 09:17.720]  gonna do my best to try to break down just some of what is going to be coming
[09:17.720 --> 09:29.600]  up today the mass Muslim raping of women in Europe and engaging in sex crimes
[09:29.600 --> 09:43.120]  here in the United States is staggering and the response to it is even more
[09:43.120 --> 09:51.560]  revealing major feminist groups have come out and said that the mass raping
[09:51.560 --> 09:57.680]  is the fault of German men and have actually attacked Germany major liberal
[09:57.680 --> 10:02.840]  leaders in the Green Party and the Social Democrats it's in my stack have
[10:02.840 --> 10:12.160]  come out and said that people against the invaders are quote as bad as rapist
[10:12.160 --> 10:18.800]  because it is the religion of the left to bring down the West because they're
[10:18.800 --> 10:27.920]  captained by their spiritual and financial leader George Soros and we
[10:27.920 --> 10:32.480]  don't just pick George Soros out because he's a good James Bond villain
[10:32.480 --> 10:38.560]  even the new James Bond movie has the main villain group behind Specter being
[10:38.560 --> 10:47.960]  the quantum group look at this drudge report dot com headline if you're a
[10:47.960 --> 10:50.480]  radio listener you can go there and see it if not we can just punch it up on

[10:57.000 --> 11:05.080]  of a crisis trillions vanish and who's involved as usual deeply in all of it
[11:05.080 --> 11:10.160]  George Soros it's like he's the devil in a black roof of smoke takes place
[11:10.160 --> 11:14.200]  whenever something horrible is happening and he's there waving his waving his
[11:14.200 --> 11:21.520]  trident he's more evil than any James Bond villain I could ever imagine I
[11:21.520 --> 11:28.120]  mean he's the real thing and he's worshipped by the Southern property
[11:28.120 --> 11:33.760]  Law Center ADL and every other scumbag group I've talked to Southern
[11:33.760 --> 11:37.800]  property Law Center and others when they call me up wouldn't do an interview and
[11:37.800 --> 11:44.800]  I bring it up and they just start giggling and laughing it's just funny to
[11:44.800 --> 11:49.240]  them the only reason years ago I would agree to talk to him was to see who
[11:49.240 --> 11:52.600]  these people are they'd be on the phone going and you claim there's a plan for
[11:52.600 --> 11:57.000]  world government and you claim they want the guns and you I go yeah George
[11:57.000 --> 12:00.760]  Soros gave you four million dollars this year they would giggle and it's the
[12:00.760 --> 12:05.440]  same thing when I've had media matters had people call me and I sit there on
[12:05.440 --> 12:09.120]  the phone with them just going you know you know you make stuff up about the
[12:09.120 --> 12:12.840]  Liberty Movement you know the IRS is persecuting people you know and they
[12:12.840 --> 12:18.320]  just giggle it's real funny I mean at least old-time villains knew they were
[12:18.320 --> 12:27.480]  doing bad they didn't giggle and laugh about it to their victims they didn't
[12:27.480 --> 12:31.000]  brag about making whole countries fail and killing hundreds of thousands of
[12:31.000 --> 12:34.680]  people like Hillary Clinton does she said last week Syria is going exactly as
[12:34.680 --> 12:38.920]  she planned which is a failed state hundreds of thousands dead she says
[12:38.920 --> 12:43.960]  Libby is going well that was in the news two weeks ago the State Department that
[12:43.960 --> 12:49.480]  she used to run came out and said their great accomplishment in 2015 was
[12:49.480 --> 12:55.000]  bringing peace to Syria this is from the same administration that tells you two
[12:55.000 --> 13:00.400]  plus two equals five and the five plus five plus five does not equal 15 in
[13:00.400 --> 13:08.280]  common core that's actually taught nationwide you cannot make up the
[13:08.280 --> 13:14.040]  magnitude of the pure mental illness they're trying to project into us to
[13:14.040 --> 13:18.640]  overturn reality they're waging war on reality they're telling flagrant blatant
[13:18.640 --> 13:36.280]  lies on purpose to get their minions to double down and just accept anything and
[13:36.280 --> 13:39.760]  they're doing that for a big reason they're going to do some really horrible
[13:39.760 --> 13:43.760]  stuff now if they're not stopped immediately and they want to set the
[13:43.760 --> 13:50.560]  precedent where their people will salute anything they run up that flagpole and
[13:50.560 --> 13:55.000]  they want to break our will you know why would they bring in the invaders of
[13:55.000 --> 14:01.600]  Syria Arab and Muslim men of fighting age around the world promised money and
[14:01.600 --> 14:06.120]  all the women and children they can rape and kill they the Russians kick their
[14:06.120 --> 14:13.320]  butt with US military leaks to the Russians for four years the Russians
[14:13.320 --> 14:18.920]  been on the ground by the way the whole time how bombshell is that Cy Hirsch what
[14:18.920 --> 14:22.800]  we told you years ago but now confirmed oh yeah the Pentagon behind Obama's back
[14:22.800 --> 14:28.520]  has been feeding the Russians the Intel and Turkey is just pulling its hair out
[14:28.520 --> 14:36.320]  right now throwing a huge fit as it wants to absorb part of Syria I mean
[14:36.320 --> 14:39.520]  there is a civil war already going on in the government folks in case you didn't
[14:39.520 --> 14:42.960]  know that's why we don't want to start a shooting war with the feds because I'm
[14:42.960 --> 14:52.840]  telling you the feds are coming over to our side right now not all of them they've
[14:52.840 --> 14:56.440]  got their socialist and globalist operators in there but even the
[14:56.440 --> 15:00.880]  mercenaries in the federal government can see this is bad for business and bad
[15:00.880 --> 15:09.000]  for the world and just as nasty why would they bring in millions of men 80% or
[15:09.000 --> 15:13.280]  more with fake passports military age many of them former ISIS fighters and
[15:13.280 --> 15:16.680]  then you wonder why they're running around raping and killing and then the
[15:16.680 --> 15:19.880]  others are human smuggled in for five to ten thousand dollars a piece
[15:19.880 --> 15:23.280]  supposedly to send money back to their families and they're promised in the
[15:23.280 --> 15:30.120]  brochures all the women you want rock and roll music and topless bars people
[15:30.120 --> 15:33.680]  keep asking why these ISIS people keep getting caught with trannies and
[15:33.680 --> 15:38.980]  prostitutes and cocaine because they're pirates folks they're the scum of the
[15:38.980 --> 15:44.200]  Middle East kicked out of their own countries couldn't get jobs the trash
[15:44.200 --> 15:50.480]  the scum they came to Syria they ran around like psychopaths they got their
[15:50.480 --> 15:55.840]  butts kicked and they desert large portions of them with the other refugees
[15:55.840 --> 16:01.600]  covering them in to Turkey into Europe and then they run around with their
[16:01.600 --> 16:05.680]  pants open just raping women in public and the police are so politically
[16:05.680 --> 16:11.400]  correct in Sweden and Germany and other countries they actually stand down this
[16:11.400 --> 16:18.680]  is I've got stacks of this news and let them rape women and the politically
[16:18.680 --> 16:22.240]  correct women don't even know what to do because they see a brown person coming
[16:22.240 --> 16:31.120]  to rape them they just crying I'm white literally crying I mean it's just over
[16:31.120 --> 16:37.120]  the top over the top and it's done on purpose because after they're done
[16:37.120 --> 16:40.960]  bringing in five ten million more and all the rest of it they'll then kick a
[16:40.960 --> 16:43.960]  bunch of them out put the rest in ghettos arrest them put them in
[16:43.960 --> 16:47.480]  concentration camps and they're gonna just nuke the whole Middle East basically
[16:47.480 --> 16:51.680]  and that's basically what the globalists are pushing for this giant
[16:51.680 --> 17:01.080]  clash of civilizations it is horrible Saudi Arabia is involved in 9-11 we
[17:01.080 --> 17:07.720]  attack Iraq the Assad regime is fighting Al Qaeda so we attack them and now
[17:07.720 --> 17:20.520]  they're blaming the quote migrant crisis the migrant crisis is then used to take
[17:20.520 --> 17:23.020]  all of our basic liberties I was just looking there on screen and got
[17:23.020 --> 17:28.320]  distracted yeah yeah that's the big news I haven't even gotten to this stack yet
[17:28.320 --> 17:34.360]  that the mayor came out over the weekend of cologne and actually the real I saw
[17:34.360 --> 17:38.400]  a German translation of what she said to the newspaper and it's worse than what
[17:38.400 --> 17:42.240]  Paul Watson wrote yesterday that everybody then picked up where she said
[17:42.240 --> 17:46.320]  women it's your fault keep men at arms length it's your fault you were dressed
[17:46.320 --> 17:50.520]  too nice she actually went on and attacked the women for being out at night
[17:50.520 --> 17:56.160]  and and and and I mean it's in the news and this is the ultra-feminist el
[17:56.160 --> 18:03.600]  hefe blaming the women because feminists are there to pimp women and run your
[18:03.600 --> 18:08.680]  life and control you the these modern third-wave feminist I mean they're CIA
[18:08.680 --> 18:15.760]  officers Gloria Steinem admits Miss magazine was created by the CIA run by

[26:02.320 --> 26:06.840]  for impeachment when the Republican leadership gets up there and puts out
[26:06.840 --> 26:15.040]  this fake supposed common knowledge that oh you don't impeach him that makes him
[26:15.040 --> 26:19.520]  a victim oh you don't impeach him you know that'll that'll let him get his
[26:19.520 --> 26:23.440]  agenda through he's lame duck let him do what he wants he's not lame duck he's a
[26:23.440 --> 26:29.800]  raging globalist Titan carrying this country's guts out and his cohorts in
[26:29.800 --> 26:37.400]  Europe following the same Goldman Sachs JP Morgan Wells Fargo combine with
[26:37.400 --> 26:42.920]  Soros captaining the whole operation he's tearing the guts out of Europe and
[26:42.920 --> 26:47.560]  bankrupting it and appointing prime ministers and appointing presidents and
[26:47.560 --> 26:52.960]  and the EU bureaucracy circumvents the EU parliament and is ceremonial they
[26:52.960 --> 26:57.880]  admit it's ceremonial they call themselves technocrats that means
[26:57.880 --> 27:05.400]  technological dictator in the definition they call themselves dictators but they
[27:05.400 --> 27:12.320]  hide it in plain view Congress better get in line so that article that video is
[27:12.320 --> 27:16.120]  key and even more important than that video I'm gonna post the video in Kit
[27:16.120 --> 27:20.160]  Daniels article and a link in the other article on impeachment zeitgeist so we
[27:20.160 --> 27:25.840]  promote the two together 75 times Obama broke the law during his presidency and
[27:25.840 --> 27:29.680]  I'm going to go over this today no matter what happens and I was reading the
[27:29.680 --> 27:37.360]  75 this morning and I had forgotten so many of the blatant caught red stinking
[27:37.360 --> 27:45.840]  handed crime I mean it is just over the top and guys we reprint me that one an
[27:45.840 --> 27:48.880]  independent article that I want to get back in today as soon as I saw the
[27:48.880 --> 27:52.200]  headline I knew they're getting ready to use the stinger missiles I knew they
[27:52.200 --> 27:56.040]  probably come out with articles claiming that you know like evolution life
[27:56.040 --> 28:00.760]  just began on its own well al-Qaeda just made stinger missiles on their own then
[28:00.760 --> 28:03.720]  you read the article they admit oh that they got from the US we don't know how
[28:03.720 --> 28:08.000]  and they're gonna start shooting stuff down with it so they blow stuff up they
[28:08.000 --> 28:12.360]  go yeah al-Qaeda built them themselves even though the article admits they
[28:12.360 --> 28:18.760]  didn't I just developed sophisticated new weaponry capable of shooting down
[28:18.760 --> 28:22.720]  passenger jets then you read the article that stinger missiles we gave them I
[28:22.720 --> 28:32.360]  mean this is just crazy any tank missiles you name it and it's just getting
[28:32.360 --> 28:39.720]  worse and worse and worse and they have these flimsy cover stories so 75 times
[28:39.720 --> 28:43.760]  Obama broke the law during presidency please folks email it post it on
[28:43.760 --> 28:47.400]  Facebook Twitter do YouTube videos about it send it to local talk show host and
[28:47.400 --> 28:51.720]  say look don't give Alex credit he doesn't care about that just cover the
[28:51.720 --> 28:57.840]  crimes just call for impeachment we're fighting these people hard and they've
[28:57.840 --> 29:01.240]  got their operatives and and their and their embedded minions and the rest of
[29:01.240 --> 29:04.680]  them like little gremlins scrabbling you know at is trying to get us off course
[29:04.680 --> 29:08.760]  it's it's not it only lets us know that we're on course it's like when enemy
[29:08.760 --> 29:13.040]  radar shoots out to see aircraft coming in you've actually fired missiles at
[29:13.040 --> 29:18.120]  that politically to hone in right on it I mean the more they attack us on certain
[29:18.120 --> 29:21.880]  issues we know we use that as a homing beacon just like World War two with the
[29:21.880 --> 29:26.680]  B-52s well that was after World War two that'd be Vietnam just like World War
[29:26.680 --> 29:31.080]  two with the B-17s and the liberators and all the rest of those bombers they
[29:31.080 --> 29:35.280]  didn't really have good info on exactly where all the bases were on the ground
[29:35.280 --> 29:38.880]  but they sure knew when they came into flak circles that that was the key area
[29:38.880 --> 29:42.040]  to drop their bombs they'd fly right into the center of that and drop the bombs
[29:42.040 --> 29:46.720]  that's what we do ladies and gentlemen stay with us
[29:47.320 --> 29:56.760]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[30:08.520 --> 30:13.040]  impeachment proceedings a document titled articles of impeachment of Barack
[30:13.040 --> 30:17.960]  Hussein Obama consists of 48 criminal charges and is set to be weighed up at
[30:17.960 --> 30:22.720]  a January 13th meeting of the RNC the resolution cites Obama's malfeasance
[30:22.720 --> 30:27.320]  misconduct and abuse of the Oval Office and includes the IRS targeting of
[30:27.320 --> 30:31.080]  conservative organizations and bypassing Congress with the use of
[30:31.080 --> 30:35.600]  executive action on key issues article three of the resolution states that Obama
[30:35.600 --> 30:39.600]  has been aiding and abetting known enemies of the United States including
[30:39.600 --> 30:44.680]  the Muslim Brotherhood ISIS al-Qaeda Hamas and the Taliban among others the
[30:44.680 --> 30:48.440]  commitment behind the resolution says that we are a nation of laws and
[30:48.440 --> 30:52.720]  separation of powers and this lets the president know that we are not gonna put

[36:24.680 --> 36:29.160]  conquer humanity itself an amalgamation of the worst forms of
[36:29.160 --> 36:35.480]  tyranny the world's ever seen with a willful commitment to evil and to death
[36:35.480 --> 36:42.840]  and to pulling down literature and society and culture all claiming that
[36:42.840 --> 36:49.000]  they are the progenitors of it and I guess coming to grips because it's
[36:49.000 --> 36:52.120]  classic for humans to demonize their enemies you got to do that to be able
[36:52.120 --> 36:57.680]  to fight them and a lot of times in wars both sides have a perspective and you
[36:57.680 --> 37:00.680]  can't you can't say who the good or bad guys are you just commit to your tribe
[37:00.680 --> 37:05.920]  your country your group and you fight but man I tell you the globalist in all
[37:05.920 --> 37:09.280]  their own writings say they hate our guts and worse scum and they're gonna
[37:09.280 --> 37:17.400]  wipe us out and that they're God and man they are the most evil enemy by
[37:19.360 --> 37:31.960]  thousands and thousands of percentage points I mean Hitler was a moral good
[37:31.960 --> 37:38.480]  person compared to these people and Hitler was super dark super evil but
[37:38.480 --> 37:52.400]  Hitler loved the UK loved it loved a few other Norse countries
[37:55.360 --> 38:03.720]  he at least liked a group he associated with he had some love twisted for one
[38:03.720 --> 38:08.640]  group you know he loved his dog but enjoyed torturing people to death he
[38:08.640 --> 38:13.280]  was horrible the globalist hate humanity as a whole they are beyond
[38:13.280 --> 38:21.640]  Hitler beyond Hitler way beyond Hitler Hitler again picked up eugenics
[38:21.640 --> 38:26.960]  technology out of England and the United States the eugenics system the eugenics
[38:26.960 --> 38:33.200]  belief system eugenics social control not the pop eugenics the real eugenics and
[38:33.200 --> 38:38.360]  he went far with it he was told implemented we back you we support
[38:38.360 --> 38:44.000]  you Rockefeller Foundation Margaret Sanger Planned Parenthood all of them
[38:44.000 --> 38:49.080]  hosted Nazi rallies hosted Ku Klux Klan rallies you can pull up pictures of
[38:49.080 --> 38:54.440]  Margaret Sanger hosting giant Nazi rallies with the German Bund in America
[38:54.440 --> 39:00.200]  they set Hitler up folks they endorsed him in Time Magazine twice in the late
[39:00.200 --> 39:06.880]  30s my grandfather my mother's father remembered on major Dallas radio
[39:06.880 --> 39:17.200]  stations the news endorsing Adolf Hitler Joe Kennedy Sr. was the ambassador to
[39:17.200 --> 39:24.080]  England basically a Nazi agent that's all come out look it up both Kennedy
[39:24.080 --> 39:30.520]  brothers worked with Nazi spies the bushes where they're head people rust god and
[39:30.520 --> 39:35.920]  I'm not getting off into Nazis today I'm saying that was a setup it's not a
[39:35.920 --> 39:41.920]  Nazi conspiracy we face they let Hitler do an experiment and set him up and
[39:41.920 --> 39:45.480]  brought him down that ought to give you an idea why they take George Soros a
[39:45.480 --> 39:54.240]  Nazi collaborator and got him running the show he's replaced David Rockefeller
[39:54.240 --> 40:01.200]  folks but everybody out there he's really taking the reins and is the prime
[40:01.200 --> 40:06.520]  mover he's the highest level we know about that's actually involved in field
[40:06.520 --> 40:11.520]  marshaling attacks on humanity and everything he does is about dumbing
[40:11.520 --> 40:15.760]  people down hurting people bankrupting people sabotage in third-world
[40:15.760 --> 40:20.480]  countries ruining currencies turning millions of people into homeless famines
[40:20.480 --> 40:29.160]  war death evil I mean you just cannot realize the level of total satanic
[40:29.160 --> 40:35.280]  behavior until you really look at it and go my god there isn't even an endgame
[40:35.280 --> 40:39.920]  here they're just committed to carrying out the most horrible garbage you can
[40:39.920 --> 40:45.920]  imagine just type in Margaret singer clan rally that'll get you her them all
[40:45.920 --> 40:55.160]  hiling her and all the rest of it I mean it's just just unbelievable 75 times
[40:55.160 --> 40:59.120]  Obama broke law during presidency I'm gonna get to that it's on in full wars
[40:59.120 --> 41:09.080]  calm now the New York Times has even had to come out today and go the Colon
[41:09.080 --> 41:17.960]  mayor is facing backlash after saying women should keep attackers at arms
[41:17.960 --> 41:25.640]  length and shouldn't dress scannily I saw that over the weekend quoted in the
[41:25.640 --> 41:29.400]  comments on info wars now link through to a German paper and try to translate it
[41:29.400 --> 41:32.760]  on Google and it appeared to be an accurate translation and I meant to call
[41:32.760 --> 41:35.840]  Paul never got around to it to tell him hey your article on Monday was important
[41:35.840 --> 41:42.720]  but not you know hardcore enough bro she actually goes further and chastises
[41:42.720 --> 41:48.120]  them I mean just what you see in the New York Times today is nothing going well
[41:48.120 --> 41:52.320]  it's kind of your fault keep my arms length she said watch how you dress
[41:52.320 --> 41:57.760]  sister the essence of what feminist claim Western men are doing where it's
[41:57.760 --> 42:02.720]  well-known Western culture has the lowest instance of sexual assault look
[42:02.720 --> 42:06.920]  it up so we're blamed for it because we're the place where women were
[42:06.920 --> 42:11.760]  liberated that's why we're bad you see
[42:11.760 --> 42:17.760]  feminists denounce German-born men after migrant sex attacks pro-refugee activists
[42:17.760 --> 42:24.640]  deflect blame from Muslim rapists and just say they know it's Germans German
[42:24.640 --> 42:31.400]  born whoa despite the factors photos video and I mean you do not see anybody
[42:31.400 --> 42:35.720]  in there that isn't a Syrian invader and I don't mean an invader from Syria I
[42:35.720 --> 42:39.480]  mean people that invaded Syria I'm gonna say that again if you read deeply it's
[42:39.480 --> 42:44.160]  admitted they 80 plus percent have fake passports they're almost all military
[42:44.160 --> 42:51.360]  aged men they have their Sunni Wahhabist who have been kicked out are there
[42:51.360 --> 42:54.680]  some real groups of refugees and people trying to get out absolutely are the real
[42:54.680 --> 42:59.280]  poor people trying to get out of North Africa absolutely and when a toddler
[42:59.280 --> 43:06.000]  drowns they take the dead body and stage it for photo shoots for the BBC that's
[43:06.000 --> 43:10.240]  how dumb they think we are so yeah there's some real refugees but I'm
[43:10.240 --> 43:18.800]  telling you a large portion are jihadis and an even bigger portion are young
[43:18.800 --> 43:22.640]  men that want sex and rock and roll but at the same time have no respect for
[43:22.640 --> 43:27.400]  women and in the radical Muslim culture if a woman is out unattended and not
[43:27.400 --> 43:31.640]  covering her face you can rape her and then she is imprisoned or executed
[43:31.640 --> 43:37.560]  because she well it's the woman's fault and that's well known and they're
[43:37.560 --> 43:42.240]  storming churches and they are attacking Christians and and and they're
[43:42.240 --> 43:47.520]  just taking over and the left is celebrating in it the sickeningness of
[43:47.520 --> 43:53.760]  these people let me actually get into these for you oh but meanwhile caught on
[43:53.760 --> 43:57.800]  tape PSA Grubbs 10-year-old girl for two minutes due to Caprice's son in her
[43:57.800 --> 44:02.640]  baggage oh you're not supposed to I thought under 12 group people not no
[44:02.640 --> 44:05.280]  they're putting them all in the body scanners I saw him put little kids in
[44:05.280 --> 44:09.120]  body scanners this weekend flying back from Phoenix Monday or Tuesday I guess
[44:09.120 --> 44:16.040]  time flies oh but the borders wide open and you fly people in from Latin
[44:16.040 --> 44:20.840]  American flights and don't even look at at their at their papers at customs CBS
[44:20.840 --> 44:27.120]  news New York Daily News come on buddy let him grope you we got terrorists this
[44:27.120 --> 44:30.760]  country it has nothing to do with it just like they want to train us to let
[44:30.760 --> 44:35.200]  radical Muslim rapist rape our women they want to train us to let them
[44:35.200 --> 44:39.640]  crop our children right in front of us put their hands on us that's what
[44:39.640 --> 44:43.640]  pedophiles do to get kids ready to be raped they're testing us as a culture
[44:43.640 --> 44:51.880]  they're breaking us how do you domesticate a horse you put it in a pin you
[44:51.880 --> 44:56.560]  feed it and then you get it to where you don't feed it unless it comes over and
[44:56.560 --> 45:01.080]  let you touch it on the nose and pretty soon you're riding on horse around and
[45:01.080 --> 45:03.640]  of course the other big rule of domesticating an animal is get them when
[45:03.640 --> 45:07.800]  they're little and you can domesticate a cult in a couple of hours because mama's
[45:07.800 --> 45:12.480]  gone he wants to snuggle up next to somebody that's another mammal that's
[45:12.480 --> 45:16.960]  how they got our kids but you break adults at those checkpoints and let me
[45:16.960 --> 45:24.560]  tell you that social engineering 110% and they admit it now the poor TSA person
[45:24.560 --> 45:28.240]  that just wants a job on average is not a bad person I can't tell you how many
[45:28.240 --> 45:31.600]  times they asked me for autographs going through and say we want to unionize we
[45:31.600 --> 45:35.680]  don't want to do the stuff they're telling us we know it's dumb but flying
[45:35.680 --> 45:43.920]  out of Phoenix there was a blonde haired woman Tuesday who was griping at
[45:43.920 --> 45:48.560]  everyone and yelling at people and bossing them around and getting in
[45:48.560 --> 45:52.400]  their faces and when she got up to look at my stuff and then she'd follow back
[45:52.400 --> 45:55.960]  online and gripe at people and stuff I'll just was looking at her not even
[45:55.960 --> 46:00.800]  steely I just like she was pathetic and she was oh hi sir oh exactly see because
[46:00.800 --> 46:05.080]  I'm not domesticated I'm not signaling that I'm you treat me with respect I'm
[46:05.080 --> 46:08.960]  gonna treat you with respect cop pulls me over I treat them with respect they
[46:08.960 --> 46:13.040]  start acting all crazy and bug-eyed I'll go excuse me why are you acting so
[46:13.040 --> 46:18.880]  aggressive doesn't really happen that often but the point is is that we need
[46:18.880 --> 46:22.360]  respect in this country and this is about not respecting the American people
[46:22.360 --> 46:27.120]  it has nothing to do with security report Muslim migrants raping women and
[46:27.120 --> 46:31.000]  children at German refugees you can't remember this September 15th last year
[46:31.000 --> 46:33.760]  remember all the hundreds and really thousands of articles that we've covered
[46:33.760 --> 46:37.200]  probably I mean it's just it's just ongoing report German media covering up
[46:37.200 --> 46:41.800]  rapes committed by Muslim migrants September 22nd last year we weren't
[46:41.800 --> 46:48.080]  prepared for this Cologne police chief speaks out after NYE mass sexual assaults
[46:48.080 --> 46:52.280]  and now the police apologize and said sorry we said it was German-born and the
[46:52.280 --> 46:55.920]  media's had to apologize I said sorry because the Germans are on the edge of
[46:55.920 --> 47:01.560]  revolt folks they're very pliant very tribal follow orders work hard twice
[47:01.560 --> 47:05.440]  those productive country probably in the world per capita they've been so
[47:05.440 --> 47:08.800]  productive they were told don't have kids you're bad you're evil yes we'll die
[47:08.800 --> 47:13.200]  as a culture we'll commit suicide but they while the Germans slit their throat
[47:13.200 --> 47:19.600]  and die as a race in Germany as a group the left wants to hop around and
[47:19.600 --> 47:23.760]  actually declare the blonde-haired blue-eyed green party and the rest of
[47:23.760 --> 47:26.680]  them you could every week there's a new article where their head people go whites
[47:26.680 --> 47:30.600]  are inherently bad thank god Germany's dying and you know there shouldn't be
[47:30.600 --> 47:33.960]  homogeneity here Germans are inherently bad and I'm glad this will be the end of
[47:33.960 --> 47:44.200]  white people so as Germany dies the last blood pumping out of the carotids the
[47:44.200 --> 47:48.440]  left is perched on them basically defecating on Germany well in rubbing
[47:48.440 --> 47:54.720]  it in smearing it everywhere and the dying Germans with blood spurting out
[47:54.720 --> 48:04.160]  like why why they're like cuz we want to tell you stop we conquered you so that's
[48:04.160 --> 48:06.920]  what this is
[48:09.560 --> 48:15.960]  mayor anti-islamification protest planned following major anti-islamification
[48:15.960 --> 48:21.000]  protest plan following mass migrant rape scandal
[48:21.000 --> 48:25.600]  feminists denounce German-born men after migrant attacks in four wars calm
[48:25.600 --> 48:29.920]  cologne new year gang assaults mayor says women should have code of conduct
[48:29.920 --> 48:35.920]  prevent future assault we reported this first people didn't believe us that the
[48:35.920 --> 48:42.040]  mayor would actually say it's it's your fault that's what she said oh yeah when
[48:42.040 --> 48:46.440]  it's two hundred guys run up and tackle you or knock you off your bike it's your
[48:46.440 --> 48:52.920]  fault caught on tape remember what they were saying remember what they were
[48:52.920 --> 49:01.880]  saying just a few months ago they I mean it was in major German newspapers they
[49:01.880 --> 49:07.000]  said do not wear short skirts around the migrants and they canceled Christmas
[49:07.000 --> 49:12.160]  parades and Christmas caroling and outdoor city Christmas events all over
[49:12.160 --> 49:16.720]  Germany and all over Italy because if the radical Muslims see it they come
[49:16.720 --> 49:19.720]  from countries where if a Christian is caught with the Bible they're put in
[49:19.720 --> 49:31.080]  prison or executed in the mild countries they just cane you they even told
[49:31.080 --> 49:35.360]  German schoolgirls not to wear the little white shirts and ties and many
[49:35.360 --> 49:42.600]  skirts I have to say those are very tasteful in my view but the issue here
[49:42.600 --> 49:51.200]  is it's all about how far can they go and there is no limit Obama gets away
[49:51.200 --> 49:55.240]  with coming after the guns with executive orders it's all open it like
[49:55.240 --> 49:57.960]  Obamacare where they can do whatever they want folks put them on a list take

[54:36.360 --> 54:43.720]  for he died the old is a Trent Resner song I didn't really get what it meant
[54:43.720 --> 54:52.160]  and kill it all away but I remember everything but I remember everything
[54:52.160 --> 55:05.040]  whatever I become my sweetest friend I become my sweetest friend everyone goes
[55:05.040 --> 55:17.520]  away you can have it all I am part of dirt and you could that's what everything
[55:17.520 --> 55:26.520]  goes back to my empire dirt the globalist all they want to do is kill
[55:26.520 --> 55:40.680]  destroyed but now I get what it means so many people can't feel anymore they
[55:40.680 --> 55:48.480]  they they can't stand up for themselves they're they're broken they are
[55:48.480 --> 55:54.480]  unconscious and we have all these clips of German police and other Germans
[55:54.480 --> 55:57.800]  talking about what happened and what unfolded there's an article from our
[55:57.800 --> 56:05.120]  team Cologne police chief speaks out after NYE mass sexual assaults that was
[56:05.120 --> 56:10.160]  again New Year's Eve the initial police report claimed night of mass rapes had
[56:10.160 --> 56:16.680]  gone peacefully they now apologize for lying Cologne police were not ready to
[56:16.680 --> 56:20.040]  deal with the mass sexual assaults committed during New Year celebrations
[56:20.040 --> 56:23.360]  that's not true they've just been ordered to cover it up the city's police
[56:23.360 --> 56:27.440]  chief told RT adding that they have never experienced such incidents before
[56:27.440 --> 56:31.320]  eventually we had a situation where a large group of men were going after
[56:31.320 --> 56:36.040]  women we didn't intervene to help but I'll admit that we were totally bewildered
[56:36.040 --> 56:40.640]  by it all we have never encountered incidents like this before and we
[56:40.640 --> 56:52.320]  weren't prepared for it Cologne chief of police Wolfgang albers told RT and they
[56:52.320 --> 56:58.280]  knew all this was gonna happen they knew full well and the answer will be more
[56:58.280 --> 57:02.680]  police more checkpoints curfews banning demonstrations which they've tried to do
[57:02.680 --> 57:18.960]  civil emergency focused on the French the Germans the Swedes and others and if
[57:18.960 --> 57:24.160]  you understand this story understand it all meanwhile man in suicide vest
[57:24.160 --> 57:30.520]  shouting Allah Akbar shot dead by Paris police today Sky News running towards
[57:30.520 --> 57:36.800]  the end result of a police station before two or three gunshots rang out and
[57:36.800 --> 57:42.520]  now they're claiming oh it wasn't a real bomb vests it just looked like one which
[57:42.520 --> 57:46.880]  if you follow the past French events they covered up RPG attacks on the one
[57:46.880 --> 57:52.840]  year anniversary of Charlie Hebdo now we see a new attack so this fits probably
[57:52.840 --> 57:58.560]  was a real vest as the French have been ordered you cover it up and by the way
[57:58.560 --> 58:04.840]  it's the one year anniversary of this it's also the anniversary today of the
[58:04.840 --> 58:08.120]  Clinton impeachment proceedings and we're gonna get the guy that brought those
[58:08.120 --> 58:13.720]  proceedings former Congressman Bob Barr on very very soon but here's the New York
[58:13.720 --> 58:19.440]  Times cologne's mayor's arms linked advice on sexual attacks stirs outcry yeah
[58:19.440 --> 58:22.680]  that's what the feminists say that the anti-women people say but oh she's a
[58:22.680 --> 58:27.120]  feminist so it's okay Obama can double black unemployment because he's black
[58:27.120 --> 58:30.960]  and he can abort all the babies because he's black because it's okay because he's
[58:30.960 --> 58:35.320]  black well she's a woman so it's okay too and Bill Clinton gonna rape whoever he
[58:35.320 --> 58:39.360]  wants because he's got a wife that calls the shots so you know it's okay and
[58:39.360 --> 58:43.840]  Hillary likes girls too so you know it's kind of cool it's just bondage with

[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:24.000]  knock us off the perch as the king of info war doesn't work because the good
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.960]  lords with us and you're with us but I tell you the key is we're doing it for
[01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:31.520]  the right reasons we're fighting tyranny because we hate tyranny not because we
[01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:34.560]  want to be big shots in the fight against it and let me tell you it's
[01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:37.400]  dangerous to be doing this but it's a lot more dangerous to be going along
[01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:41.760]  with it leon macadoo that are really important reports the nightly news last
[01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:46.200]  night about Hillary dodging issues of socialism we're gonna play this report
[01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:51.360]  come back get into the other big financial news a lot more but we can
[01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:54.480]  move to impeach Obama we're gonna be talking about that as well stay with
[01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:59.520]  us and otherwise a softball interview with Chris Matthews Hillary Clinton
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:02.640]  seemed a little bit rattled when she was asked to explain the difference
[01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:06.160]  between a democrat and a socialist what's there between a socialist and a
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:09.880]  democrat well you have a question you want to answer or do you rather not
[01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:13.720]  play well you know you'd have to ask we'll see I'm asking you you're a
[01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:16.720]  democrat he's a socialist do you would you like somebody to call you a
[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:20.200]  socialist I wouldn't like somebody calling me a socialist I'm not one okay
[01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:23.480]  what's the difference in a socialist and a democrat well I can tell you what I am
[01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:28.200]  I am a progressive democrat I'm a progressive I like to get things done
[01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:33.680]  who believes that we are better off in this country when we're trying to solve
[01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:38.720]  problems together so this is the party's leading candidate but Matthews was
[01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:42.640]  equally flustered last year when he asked the same question to the party's
[01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:47.640]  leading officer Debbie Wasserman Schultz
[01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:54.160]  I used to think there's a big difference what do you think it is the difference
[01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:57.400]  between a democrat like Hillary Clinton socialist Bernie Sanders what's the
[01:01:57.400 --> 01:02:00.320]  difference between being a democrat and being a republic well what's the bigger
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:05.080]  you're the chairman of the Democratic Party tell me the difference in you and
[01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:08.800]  a socialist the relevant debate that we'll be having over the course of this
[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:15.520]  this campaign is what's the difference between the difference because there is
[01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:20.640]  no difference in the current contemporary Democratic Party so since Bernie
[01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:24.400]  Sanders came on the scene introducing this term democratic socialism they're
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:29.240]  into the mainstream people are rightly confused here is the gist of it this is
[01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:33.960]  socialism there's a three core demands of the National Day of Action our free
[01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:39.000]  public college a cancellation of student debt and a $15 an hour minimum wage for
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:46.440]  people who work on the campus and how's that gonna be paid great question I mean
[01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:50.880]  you know so now Margaret Thatcher famously said that the problem with
[01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:54.400]  socialism is that eventually you run out of other people's money now
[01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:57.360]  socialists they say they're characterized by common ownership and
[01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:01.760]  democratic control of the means of production and of course this means
[01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:06.280]  there has to be a big state there to divvy up all of these goodies to
[01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:12.440]  everyone equally making sure that the very basic needs of society are being
[01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:17.840]  taken care of now the Democrats they also agree you know they want equality for
[01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:22.800]  all rule by the majority and they pretend to believe that nobody should be too
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:27.680]  rich right unless you're Hillary Clinton or part of the ruling class and they
[01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:33.240]  also believe in a big and I do mean a very big government taking care of
[01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:36.760]  everyone they want this huge welfare state and of course hoping that we're
[01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:41.400]  all going to need big government to care of us but presently this ideology is
[01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:45.600]  being pushed through in a very totalitarian way via the Democratic
[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:51.560]  Party so it looks very much like the totalitarian socialist society of the
[01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:56.680]  Hunger Games that movie does an excellent job kind of foreshadowing what
[01:03:56.680 --> 01:03:59.880]  that society would look like but let's take a look at the website of the
[01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:03.760]  Democratic Socialists of America this is what they have to say about the
[01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:07.960]  Democratic Party versus Socialists so the question is aren't you a party that's
[01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:12.880]  in competition with the Democratic Party for votes and support no we are not a
[01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:17.240]  separate party like our friends and allies in the feminist labor civil rights
[01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:21.480]  religious and community organizing movements many of us have been active in
[01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:25.600]  the Democratic Party we work with those movements to strengthen the party's
[01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:29.920]  left wing we hope that in some point in the future in coalition with our allies
[01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:34.760]  an alternative national party will be viable for now we'll continue to support
[01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:39.280]  progressives who have a real chance at winning elections which usually means
[01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:43.840]  left-wing Democrats I am a progressive Democrat so what's the difference
[01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:47.960]  between a Democrat and a socialist well the answer is there isn't a real
[01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:52.400]  difference anymore but no one wants to admit it
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:56.560]  and of course the socialism's only the grassroots on top of multinational
[01:04:56.560 --> 01:05:02.560]  fascism of the law tax exempt the Obama administration is pushing for the largest
[01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:07.280]  gun grab in American history we're also taking steps to make the background
[01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:11.520]  check system more efficient and we're gonna bring an outdated background
[01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:15.480]  check system into the 21st century anyone critical of the government could
[01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:19.920]  have their second amendment rights taken away simply if psychologists
[01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:25.400]  diagnose them with what they are calling oppositional defiant disorder which
[01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:31.400]  the American Psychiatric Association describes as a defiant disobedient and
[01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:36.800]  hostile behavior toward authority other measures will allow doctors to report

[01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:18.200]  Ladies and gentlemen the Washington Post and other major publications are coming out
[01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:23.840]  basically pointing at the elephant in the room or the rapist donkey in the room
[01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:30.400]  would be proper Bill Clinton who settled multiple rape allegations without of
[01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:34.280]  court settlements we've interviewed several of the prominent respected women
[01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:37.440]  they didn't have histories of making stuff up they were professionals that
[01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:41.480]  he'd invite them into a cloakroom at a party wherever and just start choking
[01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:46.040]  them bite their lip and threatened to basically you know hurt them if he
[01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:51.520]  didn't if they didn't submit and the fact that they're now bringing this out
[01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:57.680]  mainstream news after Trump and his surrogates like mr. Stone began to
[01:08:57.680 --> 01:09:02.920]  bring it up shows that Hillary is certainly being looked at to be flushed
[01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:07.920]  and we've got different insiders coming out saying that they are looking at
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:12.240]  criminal indictments in the next 60 days I'm not saying that's gonna happen but
[01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:18.000]  Joe Biden's come back now today and made statements of stories up on info wars
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:26.120]  dot com it's also up on drudge report dot com and said that well maybe you know
[01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:30.640]  maybe I might refer president I mean I regret not running for president every
[01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:35.920]  day and that's in the Hill newspaper Hillary's still very strong she's got a
[01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:41.640]  lot of blackmail power she's a Soros ally so she's a definite kingpin but
[01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:48.680]  she's obviously unhealthy she looks like she's got Alzheimer's or something and
[01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:51.360]  I'm not you know a tad people with Alzheimer's I'm just saying she looks
[01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:55.240]  like people I've seen that are starting to not basically be operating with a
[01:09:55.240 --> 01:10:00.600]  full deck and so could just life be catching up with her what does that
[01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:05.640]  mean and then we've just got all of the incredible Muslim invasion with the
[01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:09.760]  rapist because most of these are people again that invaded Syria got kicked out
[01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:12.960]  others are just people that want to have party and have fun and have been
[01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:16.760]  promised you know all these free women by the people smugglers they come into
[01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:20.760]  Germany totally politically correct paralyzed by political correctness and
[01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:24.560]  they just don't know what to do now the German media has had to apologize the
[01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:28.480]  German police have had to apologize and say sorry we said nothing happened that
[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:34.320]  night then we blamed it on white Germans indigenous Germans okay it's it's
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:38.320]  refugees North African Syrian well most of them really aren't even Syrian in fact
[01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:42.480]  history I've seen Syria's a place where you don't have this radical Muslim stuff
[01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:47.400]  of treating women like chattel we've got a big initiative we're pushing and I'm
[01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:49.600]  gonna talk about this with Joel Scales and editor-in-chief of World Affairs
[01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:53.960]  brief here in a moment 75 times Obama broke the law during presidency I'm
[01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:58.240]  going to get to this after he leaves us at about 40 after I'm gonna read all 75
[01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:03.360]  I promise going to get to this Kit Daniels article very powerful we need to
[01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:09.760]  push for impeachment just to force Congress to put Obamacare and Fast and
[01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:14.000]  Furious and IRS persecution and executive power grabs and coming after the
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:19.600]  guns on the executive issue alone it's clearly out of control impeachable and
[01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:23.720]  we've had constitutional lawyers on about it I'm gonna get Bruce Fine back on
[01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:27.600]  so many others now is the time to move for impeachment people say well don't do
[01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:31.600]  that will make him a victim they're going for broke people he's
[01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:36.760]  not a lame duck they're savaging us the Republicans are using Obama as cover to
[01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:40.480]  get through the globalist agenda the same agenda here as it is in Europe flood
[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:45.520]  the country bankrupt it dumb everybody down that story's on info wars.com
[01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:51.000]  there's also a video the impeachment zeitgeist five minutes long an info
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:55.840]  wars Natalie news report powerful John Bowne report get it out to everybody
[01:11:55.840 --> 01:11:59.760]  you are the power now I want to show people on Facebook mentions that we're
[01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:06.600]  going to our guest this is just one video system we have when Kanye West comes
[01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:10.480]  out and does a video the average give video gets about a million views his
[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:15.840]  biggest ones promoted nationwide to his tens of millions of followers get 10
[01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:21.560]  15 million views now that's the most popular thing in America our Facebook
[01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:28.560]  mentions is now getting a million to two million views every couple videos the
[01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:33.720]  average was getting 300 to 400,000 views the average is actually going up I'm not
[01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:36.480]  bragging about Alex Jones being successful this is just one little
[01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:42.520]  media system we have it's that even in the dead space of Facebook meant to
[01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:45.880]  dumb everything down with and they've got algorithms and everything to keep us
[01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:48.920]  from spreading I mean that's admitted but but they can't but they have to act
[01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:51.920]  like they're still open to the public as we follow all the rules look at these
[01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:57.400]  views I shot a video yesterday afternoon 363,000 views that'll be at a million
[01:12:57.400 --> 01:13:02.960]  tomorrow look at the one before that of the day before 1,080,000 Congress
[01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:07.960]  considers criminal charges against Obama insider Obama about to unleash hell
[01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:14.200]  1,800,000 look at the video before that Obama wants civil war 524,000 it goes on
[01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:18.040]  and on there's someone there with three four million views now what I'm saying
[01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:21.760]  is we've gone from a hundred thousand views on average a few weeks ago on
[01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:28.000]  there to 300 400 500,000 a million two million three million I'm talking to
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:31.640]  people in government they're really waking up militaries waking up police
[01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:36.000]  are waking up a lot of the citizens are waking up and the system is going to
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:40.440]  want to run a false flag in my view or provocateur us into a shooting war that's
[01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:45.720]  why this isn't the time I believe for civil disobedience like what we see
[01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:49.280]  how people can do it but I have my opinion that they don't have all the
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:55.000]  local supporting them they don't have the Hammond supporting them you've got
[01:13:55.240 --> 01:14:02.240]  obvious provocateur action going on the same old players I think the bunnies are
[01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:07.040]  good people but that's another reason that it isn't their ranch they've been
[01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:10.880]  on for 140 years it isn't where they've run everybody out with the last family
[01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:13.680]  then with the fed saying we're gonna shoot you you come get your cattle and
[01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:18.400]  then people cross the line into finance that was incredibly powerful a George
[01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:22.640]  Washington moment in my view but also extremely dangerous and shook Harry Reid
[01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:27.040]  he was shaking when he called him terrorist then the enemy is going to
[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:30.840]  want to trick people like that with their incredibly good name into things
[01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:34.000]  that are strategic disasters now I'm not going to spend more than five minutes on
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:37.600]  this but Joel scowls and I really respect former Marine Corps fighter
[01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:42.360]  pilot Vietnam best-selling author researcher obviously World Affairs brief
[01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:46.800]  dot com editor I learned that he basically had some of the same views as I
[01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:50.160]  did and I know a lot of people are listening to this now because it's
[01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:53.600]  really a no-brainer with the timing of the Obama gun grab and the projection
[01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:57.800]  they now have of you know arm takeover and all this their cause is just I
[01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:03.880]  believe overall but it's the optics and the the globalists are just having glee
[01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:08.640]  with this now saying see domestic terrorist Yolkida then we'll get into
[01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:11.400]  the impeachment we'll get into Russia we'll get in everything else with Joel
[01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:15.400]  scowls and World Affairs brief dot com Joel thank you so much for joining as
[01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:18.440]  you just heard my five-minute breakdown there do you agree with that
[01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:23.960]  disagree what can you augment what can you say about the situation unfolding
[01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:28.640]  there in Oregon well I do agree with you Alex I think it's very important to
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:33.680]  understand the feds are about to make an example of the Bundy group there in
[01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:39.600]  Harney County and so as I say I'm gonna I want to suggest and I think and
[01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:44.360]  hopefully that they'll be seeing this I want to suggest a way out of this that
[01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:48.160]  I think will benefit both sides now I happen to know Amon Bundy he's a very
[01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:56.240]  fine person I think it was a misstep to be able to go into an armed occupation
[01:15:56.240 --> 01:16:01.040]  of this a while of refuge just because of just like you said it's one thing to
[01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:05.000]  be defending your own property against an armed intrusion by the BLM that can
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:10.160]  get public support but when you're trying to undo a national wildlife refuge
[01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:16.520]  which is a matter of legislative import and you know meet and the public
[01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:20.680]  expects that to go through Congress you're not going to win that battle and
[01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:28.080]  now I've seen on Bundy Ranch blog spot com the detailed evidence of all of the
[01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:32.840]  injustices the ranchers not just the Hammons had suffered when the wildlife
[01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:37.720]  Fish and Wildlife Service and BLM went to strangle these ranchers cut off their
[01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:42.520]  water supplies cut off their access to the ranch when roads ran through the
[01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:46.920]  wildlife refuge they have a long setting them up for control burns they let
[01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:51.040]  everybody else do that's right and didn't prosecute themselves their own
[01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:54.720]  agents for damaging property but prosecute people when it gets out of
[01:16:54.720 --> 01:17:01.440]  control worse yet in the Hammons case they they had to in order to invoke the
[01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:07.440]  terrorism statute they had to rule these accidental burns as arson and in order to
[01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:12.480]  do that they got a mentally unstable grandson of the Hammons to in the I
[01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:17.440]  think this is just the prosecutors going after an individual who was only 11
[01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:22.880]  years old the time got him to say that the burning of the 2006 fire was done as
[01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:27.560]  an arson to cover up for a hunting or hunting deer on federal land this is
[01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:30.840]  important because it's the only one they could pin the charge of arson and it
[01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:36.160]  turns out to be bogus not only was the witness even by the judge's admission
[01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:40.680]  not competent to testify of that five years after the fact he wasn't mentally
[01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:45.760]  competent the point is it defies all description I mean the only thing you
[01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:50.440]  need to cover up a hunting piece of poaching on federal properties remove
[01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:55.760]  the carcass which every poacher does you can't burn a carcass by starting a fire
[01:17:55.760 --> 01:18:00.000]  you can't even burn the entrails it's ridiculous for anybody that knows it's
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:03.520]  like saying that the Dundee's were stealing land when they had grazing rights
[01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:09.280]  since the 1870s they play on the public's ignorance of common law and of
[01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:13.480]  state law and federal law so there are a lot of injustices that have justified
[01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:17.600]  the Bundy's who have been tracking all of the other ranchers who have suffered
[01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:21.800]  at this and so basically they made a tactical mistake by saying we want to
[01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:27.720]  undo the wildlife reference that can't be done so what I suggest that Amon does
[01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:32.640]  is before any armed confrontation before they seal off and start a siege that he
[01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:36.320]  take the high ground take advantage of the fact that the media is already given
[01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:40.800]  some fairly favorable press coverage to the fact that there's no crazies running
[01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:44.440]  around they're cleaning up the place they're taking care of it they're not
[01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:48.520]  ram sacking it in other words there's been some positive press coverage even
[01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:52.200]  from the liberal media in Oregon they had to take advantage of that say we're
[01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:57.080]  going to stand down voluntarily because one we've already got a sufficient
[01:18:57.080 --> 01:19:02.360]  amount of positive press for the land Western lands movement here and number
[01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:08.120]  two that it's very important to realize that the ranchers have been in their
[01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:11.760]  rights have been violated and what they need to say is we want to demand a
[01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:17.240]  ranchers bill of rights be created in Congress this is similar to the pilots
[01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:21.320]  bill of rights when the FAA was running rough shot over pilots and had control
[01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:26.320]  of the of the judicial machinery that prosecuted pilots and they they force
[01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:30.440]  Congress through Congress they force the FAA to set up a standard of due
[01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:34.920]  process and I think that's what ranchers need so that water rights cannot be
[01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:40.720]  taken away the grazing rights cannot be diminished arbitrarily by the BLM if they
[01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:44.360]  were to come out with a proposal like this saying this is what we want and
[01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:48.560]  then stand down they would have the high ground people would say yeah they're not
[01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:52.880]  a bunch of crazies this would accrue to their benefit Joel this is exactly what
[01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:56.920]  I said days ago and I'm sure we both independently came up with the same idea
[01:19:56.920 --> 01:20:00.840]  because it's just common sense exactly I like the Bundy's they're walking into a
[01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:06.440]  trap and then instantly I come out Sunday and I say look out for federal
[01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:10.640]  infiltrators I mean they're gonna show up like flies on you know what and be
[01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:14.360]  careful about people calling for violence look out the Bundy's are good
[01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:17.440]  people I understand the government's in the wrong they're the ones running
[01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:21.240]  around arm-seizing things under the Declaration of Independence I get that
[01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:24.880]  you could say they're in the right but this is stepping into a trap in my
[01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:29.560]  informed view I mean I've shown I'm not stupid either it's common sense really
[01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:34.360]  and then sure enough Joe Biggs gets there Monday and prominent people that
[01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:39.760]  are running things run up and yell at him how dare you say we're feds by a name
[01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:43.160]  and the Bundy's are feds and then he said we never said that I was something
[01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:47.920]  well that matter you know blah with people in there telling them lies to
[01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:52.880]  then cut them off from people that would support them this is classic that I've
[01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:57.520]  seen in 21 years dealing with malicious dealing with standoffs being inside
[01:20:57.520 --> 01:21:01.400]  standoffs trying to negotiate an end to them like the case with the gray case
[01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:06.480]  and then the feds come in tell them bull and then it comes out it was feds
[01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:12.080]  doing it I mean it's just crazy and and we have evidence already that I don't
[01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:16.120]  even want to give attention to because just adds to the whole thing you know
[01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:20.240]  from who the FBI was there with who they're running I mean we have it all
[01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:28.360]  and it's just so I mean on video and it's just so terrible and then once
[01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:32.600]  people have been told you're talking about about them in this weird fake
[01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:36.280]  kinship thing the federal handles handlers will engage in these are
[01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:39.800]  experts psychological warfare people then even though it's not true that I
[01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:43.000]  didn't talk about about the Bundy's it doesn't matter because now we better not
[01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:46.960]  talk to Alex because he doesn't like us when I like them I'm here talking to
[01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:50.800]  him like a straight man does you know just straight to him straight talk
[01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:56.240]  straight shooting I mean I just I just so sad that the Liberty movement is not
[01:21:56.240 --> 01:22:02.520]  more sophisticated Joel well you know there's no I completely agree anyone
[01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:08.160]  who's in a situation like Amon Bundy in his group has got to realize that when
[01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:10.560]  you have an open invitation for everybody to come and join us you're
[01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:14.280]  gonna have federal agent provocateurs coming in there and one of those
[01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:17.760]  people's probably going to take a pot shot at law enforcement if they get
[01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:21.960]  nearby and then law enforcement will have an example to start shooting so it's
[01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:25.240]  very important to stand down while this thing is peaceful while you've got the
[01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:29.960]  high ground Amon so that you can continue and I would say to state the
[01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:35.120]  tough position they're taking that in the future we will come to the defense of
[01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:40.200]  any rancher who is being persecuted by the BLM and but we'll do it in a
[01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:45.040]  peaceful manner we will be armed but we will come there to keep these kinds of
[01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:49.120]  people from being railroaded into prison as the Hammons were I'm it's
[01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:54.640]  unfortunate the Hammons succumbed to the the latest threats they really were
[01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:58.840]  put through the ringer in a very phony court situation where there was jury
[01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:04.360]  tampering where there's threats and the poor judge tried to savage his cons I
[01:23:04.360 --> 01:23:08.040]  know he was under pressure by the feds to throw this terrorist statute he tried
[01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:12.080]  to give less than the minimum sentence and then got overturned I think he's
[01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:17.400]  rolling in his retirement sadness of what he did but that's what happens in
[01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:21.040]  judges there's so many controlled judges who are afraid to stand up to the
[01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:26.840]  federal government it's incredible Joel Scowze and again as our guest look
[01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:31.120]  looking at the whole backdrop of things the timing of this there's been so many
[01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:35.400]  demonstrations there the last year with the mine being you know shut down on the
[01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:40.920]  feds grabbing buffer zones around it classic UN agenda 21 tactics used
[01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:45.640]  around the world but the timing of the group of people being led in the
[01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:49.120]  demonstration not knowing what's about to happen and then suddenly under peer
[01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:54.240]  pressure you're in a federal building and hey we're taking it over and then you
[01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:58.920]  learn it's not the Bundy's that were even on showing it I mean come on people
[01:23:58.920 --> 01:24:05.280]  this right before Obama rolls all this out this gave big victories and I'm
[01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:10.280]  not bashing anybody but I just got to be honest big victories for optics to make
[01:24:10.280 --> 01:24:14.000]  gun owners look like there's this big insurrection happening and hopefully
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:18.120]  they want to kick something bigger off so I think the cause is just good people
[01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:26.040]  involved but undoubtedly there is a scene hand right in plain view involved in
[01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:30.720]  all this that people need to admit tactically when something isn't the
[01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:34.640]  best idea and I agree they've had some victories getting the word out the BLM
[01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:41.880]  so bad that it's waking a lot of folks up so right now is the time to like you
[01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:45.680]  said put this declaration out announce they're forming an organization say they
[01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:49.040]  did it to bring attention hey occupy this occupy that does it and don't get
[01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:53.840]  called terrorist and then get out of there and then the feds will really look
[01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:58.680]  like they're persecuting him if they come after him but I got to tell you Joe we
[01:24:58.680 --> 01:25:02.040]  obviously have reporters there at the Bundy Ranch very good Christian hard
[01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:05.800]  working people that that do have a conscience and are committed and I and
[01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:11.640]  as a man I admire it but at the same time there's 10 guys in alleys you know
[01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:15.040]  with clubs I'm not gonna take them all on you know you know you know just so I
[01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:17.640]  can get somebody stolen wallet back I'm gonna call the police it's just not a
[01:25:17.640 --> 01:25:21.840]  smart fight and I know they prayed about it at the Bundy Ranch and decided to go
[01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:24.920]  up against the feds and all that and when they were ready to die that's what
[01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:28.560]  they prayed about and I know they're having those same prayers right now but
[01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:33.000]  you they just can't get too much into the psychology of this being Custer's
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:37.480]  last stand of the Alamo because I just strategically at this point this is not
[01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:43.160]  our Alamo event that would be a disaster if a civil war physically kicks off
[01:25:43.160 --> 01:25:47.200]  right now you could not give a better present in my view Joel Scalzen to the
[01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:51.280]  globalist that's right I think Alex that you need to live for a better day
[01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:54.880]  another fight this is a long-term battle it's not gonna be won by this one
[01:25:54.880 --> 01:26:00.200]  occupation and so take the best deal you can get right now which is you walk out
[01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:04.160]  of there without being arrested you're free to protest again at a more
[01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:08.760]  convenient and better and more justifiable site and you can continue to
[01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:13.040]  this fight on into the future that's my message to him and if you can hear well
[01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:16.680]  we've got his number and then he agrees to do interviews and then doesn't as if
[01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:20.160]  we need as if that boost our ratings to have them on I mean it did doesn't I can
[01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:22.840]  shoot a video right now and have three million views and we've got millions
[01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:27.400]  watching right now millions listening and just to show how these different
[01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:33.000]  agents of influence get in there and cut patriots off from people it's just you
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.920]  could write us you could write a script about this I mean I remember looking at
[01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:39.920]  the transcripts of the Waco stuff and Ruby Ridge and these events and the way
[01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:43.880]  they cut groups off and the way they manipulate it you see the scripting and
[01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:49.920]  Joel shifting gears now as soon as I saw this headline yesterday morning as
[01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:53.240]  soon as I saw it I knew what I was going to read and then I went and read it and
[01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:56.520]  sure enough it was there because I was expecting this I knew this was coming I
[01:26:56.520 --> 01:26:59.520]  could tell it was the next phase in what they're doing they've given them
[01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:02.880]  thousands of stinger missiles other impads service to air missiles out of
[01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:08.080]  Benghazi Saudi Arabia is giving it to ISIS al Qaeda I've confirmed that with
[01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:12.000]  top officers of the military on and off record everybody's seen it and heard it
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:16.960]  we're the first to report it here years ago ISIS developed sophisticated new
[01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:21.520]  weaponry capable of shooting down passenger jets newly developed
[01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:24.880]  technology could allow ISIS to use redundant and decommissioned service
[01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:28.920]  air missiles to attack aircraft and then as soon as all the top headline I knew
[01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:33.520]  what would be below exist it's just so scripted and then you read oh it's
[01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:37.600]  weapons they got from the US and others they know how to recharge the batteries
[01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:43.320]  now so Joel talk about spinning it they've developed sophisticated weapons
[01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:47.840]  no it's Western weapons so now they start shooting down airliners and stuff
[01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:53.560]  this is the plausible flimsy deniability that they develop technology now I
[01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:59.320]  mean recharging a battery you know everything about ISIS and whether it's
[01:27:59.320 --> 01:28:03.640]  its initial development to become 50 or 60,000 man-terrorist force without
[01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:07.520]  anybody knowing it in US intelligence that's just not believable they're not
[01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:11.880]  developing any of this technology we know that the chemical warfare weapons
[01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:16.720]  they used to smuggle in in order to implicate the Assad regime came out of
[01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:20.520]  Turkey and some of it came out of Saudi Arabia acting as surrogates for the
[01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:24.440]  United States if they're getting old decommissioned missiles listen these
[01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:28.920]  things are locked away tighter than a drum and old military bases in the US they
[01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:33.780]  have to be trans shipped out of there across the ocean through Turkey or Saudi
[01:28:33.780 --> 01:28:37.400]  Arabia I mean who's kidding who that they said we know Hillary did it through
[01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:42.680]  through the State Department the Pentagon wouldn't well I'm not saying
[01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:45.960]  that Hillary would know what's going on in the dark side of government and she's
[01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:50.400]  a puppet of the dark side but you know typically Obama or Hillary or even
[01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:54.440]  George W. Bush didn't know what the dark side of government was doing I mean this
[01:28:54.440 --> 01:28:59.960]  is too dangerous to let politicos know about you know dark side operations they
[01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:03.680]  need plausible deniability Alex and of course you were an officer in the
[01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:06.560]  Marine Corps yourself but you wouldn't go along with dark side stuff so I guess
[01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:10.920]  they kept you at a certain level yeah you know unless you become a real
[01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:16.280]  abject yes man and you go to the war college and come under the influence of
[01:29:16.280 --> 01:29:21.440]  Georgetown University professors who are mostly globalists you know there's a
[01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:26.060]  real screening process Alex before you can get into the dark side and they
[01:29:26.060 --> 01:29:30.240]  don't let most military officers even yes man really into the dark side stuff
[01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:34.800]  they bring them along to a certain point give them plausible excuses you run
[01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:38.040]  things but they don't let them really let's talk about who's actually in the
[01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:42.480]  dark side on the other side because I had some family that was in the dark side
[01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:47.280]  that's one reason I know so much about this we'll be right back in full wars.com

[01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:09.840]  have been reported to police in every major city including the German capital
[01:30:09.840 --> 01:30:14.000]  of Berlin Hamburg Stuttgart and DÃ¼sseldorf the events were downplayed by
[01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:18.600]  German news media until scores of women came forward to report rapes and sexual
[01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:22.920]  abuse forcing coverage German ministers claimed that there was no evidence
[01:30:22.920 --> 01:30:27.080]  asylum seekers were involved in the violence but that cover-up is beginning

[01:30:31.840 --> 01:30:36.560]  were newly arrived Syrian refugees an elite police report claims that one of

[01:37:39.560 --> 01:37:44.400]  this other news but but this is so important let's get into other
[01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:50.160]  geopolitical issues the economy Hillary just briefly if you can hit some of
[01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:58.000]  these points just briefly about Obama first off this is very draconian what
[01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:02.440]  he's doing with the guns because it's so open-ended applying a no-fly list to
[01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:06.200]  gun owners when the no-fly list is so unconstitutional I mean I think this
[01:38:06.200 --> 01:38:10.400]  really signifies a bold acceleration in what they're doing and I'm really
[01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:15.400]  concerned about a false flag. Let me discuss the Obama executive orders first
[01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:19.120]  of all it's indicative that the administration realizes that they're
[01:38:19.120 --> 01:38:23.200]  on tenuous legal ground and I think they see that there is impeachment
[01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:27.480]  possibilities being prepared it's notable that the administration said that
[01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:31.960]  these were advisory only that in fact they don't admit it that they don't have
[01:38:31.960 --> 01:38:36.440]  the force of law so even though the media is not telling us that that's what
[01:38:36.440 --> 01:38:41.160]  the technical language says advisory only and so I think you're right
[01:38:41.160 --> 01:38:46.760]  Obama's you know he's got a very deadly agenda including gun control the phony
[01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:52.560]  climate change and other things going forward in this and illegal immigration
[01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:57.520]  the amnesty to continue damn those are the three big agendas and refugees which
[01:38:57.520 --> 01:39:01.720]  as I covered in the world of red breeze they're flying in on UPS empty planes
[01:39:01.720 --> 01:39:06.240]  from Europe into secret locations so that no press is invited so that it gets
[01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:09.760]  to flood the country and only claim that there's ten thousand when they'll be
[01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:13.480]  much more he's engaged in sedition opening the borders having the border
[01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:17.400]  patrol complete the smuggling process planes coming in from Mexico clearing
[01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:21.760]  customs without being checked this is isn't that impeachable I mean these are
[01:39:21.760 --> 01:39:25.280]  his directives and now they're gonna have the you know the NIC system with
[01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:29.760]  these secret directives and these advisories carrying out this illegal
[01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:34.480]  agenda this is government by stealth is it not sir it absolutely is and it's
[01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:38.840]  illegal it's unconstitutional the basic problem that I see with the impeachment
[01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:44.000]  process is that the Republican sabotage the Clinton impeachment David Skippers
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:48.400]  the Democratic prosecutor of impeachment of one said it was the Republican
[01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:52.280]  leadership which forced my hand it was a Republican leadership that refused to
[01:39:52.280 --> 01:39:56.040]  back we had him at the time David Shippers exposed the whole thing that's
[01:39:56.040 --> 01:40:02.760]  right and I think with the Boehner mantle over the speakership of the house
[01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:08.600]  and and John or in Paul Ryan following in his footsteps this omnibus bill was a
[01:40:08.600 --> 01:40:13.240]  sellout of the first order I'm not sure that we can depend on the so-called
[01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:17.080]  conservative majorities in Congress to follow through even if we've got an
[01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:21.000]  airtight case that's my my fear Alex well you're absolutely right that's why I
[01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:24.200]  said this morning if Paul Ryan doesn't at least say he's gonna start an
[01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:27.200]  investigation impeachment if they don't have hearings about the executive
[01:40:27.200 --> 01:40:32.000]  power grab or start passing laws ordering these agencies not to follow it
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:37.000]  and and in stripping money if they do then I watch what it in California the
[01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:41.840]  last two years and in Massachusetts and in Connecticut and in New York State a
[01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:46.440]  stealth war we buy a thousand rounds of 22 ammo the feds come take your guns say
[01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:50.720]  we're doing a psychological doctors asses dad have a gun have you seen it oh my
[01:40:50.720 --> 01:40:55.680]  gosh call the CPS there's a gun out this is just gonna be a soft secret behind
[01:40:55.680 --> 01:41:02.920]  the scenes probing to harass gun owners and the gun culture and set the
[01:41:02.920 --> 01:41:07.800]  precedent for more of this stealth law garbage it's just unprecedented it is
[01:41:07.800 --> 01:41:12.160]  Alex and once again I think this is indicative what I have projected for
[01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:16.880]  many years that even though I am the first one to admit the government is
[01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:20.200]  creating excess prison capacity to lock away dissidents of that they are
[01:41:20.200 --> 01:41:23.760]  preparing for martial law they are preparing to take down distance that's
[01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:27.880]  what NSA spying is all about it's not about terrorism which is generally a
[01:41:27.880 --> 01:41:33.520]  government created organization expect especially at the highest levels these
[01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:38.000]  NSA lists are to track people who are terrorists and that's why they put out
[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:44.760]  phony disinformation like the DHS buying two billion rounds mom ammunition
[01:41:44.760 --> 01:41:48.360]  yeah they put out an order for that but they never bought it the point is I
[01:41:48.360 --> 01:41:51.440]  believe that they put that out so that they could track through the internet
[01:41:51.440 --> 01:41:55.800]  everyone who got upset about it who passed that information on to others and
[01:41:55.800 --> 01:42:00.080]  they got on list so we have to be very careful about the height that we get
[01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:05.280]  attached to and pass on an internet's because we're being tracked according to
[01:42:05.280 --> 01:42:08.560]  that isn't the answer to this though choose what you're strategically gonna
[01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:11.560]  do whether you're gonna be on the radar or whether you're gonna be politically
[01:42:11.560 --> 01:42:16.040]  active and if you decide to be a warrior in the info war John Hancock it put
[01:42:16.040 --> 01:42:20.480]  your name across the big you know declaration want to be on the list
[01:42:20.480 --> 01:42:24.000]  don't be scared of the chilling effect because if they succeed in the chilling
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:27.820]  effect then they're gonna really be able to succeed I don't see them
[01:42:27.820 --> 01:42:31.080]  succeeding because you know we talked about dark side I want to spend a few
[01:42:31.080 --> 01:42:35.400]  minutes on that people doing a lot of dark side stuff believe they're doing it
[01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:39.960]  for right reasons when they have problems of conscience they basically
[01:42:39.960 --> 01:42:43.960]  either just disappear to the countryside or they get killed or they get set up at
[01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:50.160]  imprisoned and that's what goes on but now we've had such a debate exposing
[01:42:50.160 --> 01:42:55.040]  dark side operations they're so admitted that I'm telling you I talked to a lot of
[01:42:55.040 --> 01:43:01.240]  famous special forces people and people that are high level in person and I
[01:43:01.240 --> 01:43:04.400]  mean I don't run into special forces people that aren't listeners now and
[01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:08.840]  aren't awake and don't know what's going on I mean they're super awake I'm
[01:43:08.840 --> 01:43:12.840]  running into more and more feds who go look man we don't want to totally sort
[01:43:12.840 --> 01:43:16.600]  of country we get your ride this is scary the Secret Service is just flipping
[01:43:16.600 --> 01:43:20.840]  out about the stuff Obama's doing and that's why they're bringing up these
[01:43:20.840 --> 01:43:25.080]  scandals to control them obviously but probably bringing them the hookers to do
[01:43:25.080 --> 01:43:29.600]  it but I mean as you know you've talked about that it's just they've got a
[01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:32.760]  problem in that they're so decompartmentalized they wanted to just run
[01:43:32.760 --> 01:43:36.120]  al-Qaeda in Syria and everybody go along with it well that's not happened I mean
[01:43:36.120 --> 01:43:39.520]  so can you speak to dark side and you know who you think some of the top
[01:43:39.520 --> 01:43:44.800]  controllers is it still Kissinger we know Soros is highly involved they have
[01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:48.600]  these Bilderberg type confabs with the kingpins where they fine-tune the
[01:43:48.600 --> 01:43:53.600]  agenda I mean we know how it works but there's a very small percent that are
[01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:57.880]  actual as you know Luciferians to believe they're carrying out this great
[01:43:57.880 --> 01:44:02.880]  work for a greater good most of the people are just mercenaries yeah there's
[01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:06.880]  actually a few other categories that I would include Alex as I pointed out in
[01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:11.200]  strategic relocation I talked about the government threat there are at least
[01:44:11.200 --> 01:44:16.120]  three levels of conspirators in this globalist conspiracy there are the
[01:44:16.120 --> 01:44:21.240]  very top level and as I've explained on your show before I do think is satanic
[01:44:21.240 --> 01:44:25.160]  base there's only one way to explain the generational effect that we're talking
[01:44:25.160 --> 01:44:29.600]  about that is for centuries this has been going on no single evil man could
[01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:34.280]  put such a thing in operation and expect his underlings to carry it forth
[01:44:34.280 --> 01:44:38.760]  flawlessly nobody for example would bring war upon themselves destroying
[01:44:38.760 --> 01:44:43.840]  their own wealthy infrastructure unless they had satanic promises that I'll
[01:44:43.840 --> 01:44:47.800]  bless you on the other side you know if you help me build my kingdom but you
[01:44:47.800 --> 01:44:51.960]  know you can't spread a conspiracy like that very far before it gets people
[01:44:51.960 --> 01:44:59.560]  turned off and afraid so I think only the top 25 or 30 perhaps know about the
[01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:03.760]  full war agenda and bringing a third world war upon this nation in order to
[01:45:03.760 --> 01:45:07.480]  drive people into glory who is at the top from your research obviously the
[01:45:07.480 --> 01:45:13.840]  literal Transylvanian royal family the Rothschilds are at the top the
[01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:17.920]  Rockefellers are at the top there's a lot of old families I mean really it is
[01:45:17.920 --> 01:45:23.120]  those classic names for my research there at the top I'll frankly admit I
[01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:26.240]  don't know and I don't think anybody does know because it's the best kept
[01:45:26.240 --> 01:45:31.360]  secret in the world now we do know about those people who are public and I
[01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:34.640]  personally agree with you I think Rockefeller was at the top I think he's
[01:45:34.640 --> 01:45:39.520]  too old and seen on now to be my agree who has it been handed to because I know
[01:45:39.520 --> 01:45:42.680]  they're trying a transference they tried it to Senator Rockefeller he's not been
[01:45:42.680 --> 01:45:49.640]  doing good my top pick is the big new Brzezinski as the heir apparent he's got
[01:45:49.640 --> 01:45:54.480]  an evil aura about him he does they worship him when he goes to these CFR
[01:45:54.480 --> 01:45:58.240]  events they look at him with all that tells you yeah it does tell you an
[01:45:58.240 --> 01:46:04.280]  awful lot Kissinger is has been the kingpin of the public face of globalism
[01:46:04.280 --> 01:46:09.560]  for so many years and he's still around I mean we have the admission from Jim
[01:46:09.560 --> 01:46:16.520]  Jones the national security advisor under Obama that in his 19 2009 Munich
[01:46:16.520 --> 01:46:21.680]  orders on the CFR website from his Henry Kissinger every day we get daily
[01:46:21.680 --> 01:46:25.080]  marching orders of the National Security Council from Henry Kissinger and
[01:46:25.080 --> 01:46:28.440]  associates passed down through Brent Scowcroft and Sandy Berger so those
[01:46:28.440 --> 01:46:33.400]  people have to be top-level conspirators I think the foreign policy advisors of
[01:46:33.400 --> 01:46:39.960]  every puppet president are the NSA advisor and there's a domestic advisor
[01:46:39.960 --> 01:46:45.480]  to right now Valerie Jarrett she's a pretty evil woman I believe and advises
[01:46:45.480 --> 01:46:50.200]  him in that the socialists agenda there but you know there are dozens and
[01:46:50.200 --> 01:46:54.320]  thousands perhaps people especially when they run up against a major conspiracy
[01:46:54.320 --> 01:46:58.160]  like the 9-11 which was a government operation from beginning again I can
[01:46:58.160 --> 01:47:02.760]  tell you that every one of the people on the 9-11 Commission know that there's a
[01:47:02.760 --> 01:47:06.120]  control system know that it was a government operation and know that
[01:47:06.120 --> 01:47:09.920]  they've been silent you're right sir six of them went public and said it's all
[01:47:09.920 --> 01:47:13.760]  a lie it's a cover-up bare minimum stand down I've talked to members of
[01:47:13.760 --> 01:47:18.080]  Congress that literally on the phone start crying you hear him go excuse me
[01:47:18.080 --> 01:47:21.400]  when they start talking about it and on air you hear him choking up when they've
[01:47:21.400 --> 01:47:25.560]  read the 28 pages and more and that's just proving they stood down I mean it's
[01:47:25.560 --> 01:47:31.000]  exactly even high-level commissioners who the system thought they could trust
[01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:35.960]  freaked out and tried to go public a Panetta the transportation secretary went
[01:47:35.960 --> 01:47:40.720]  public five times and said no Cheney was there Cheney order to stand down so
[01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:45.440]  again it exactly it shows how many good people there are so how can then such a
[01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:50.040]  small group continue to carry their evil out well it comes from the threat of
[01:47:50.040 --> 01:47:54.760]  force ultimately they do kill enough people look at the 50 to 80 people who
[01:47:54.760 --> 01:47:58.800]  died surrounding Bill Clinton Bill Clinton didn't order those deaths but I'll
[01:47:58.800 --> 01:48:03.080]  tell you the the protection team of globalist the ran Bill Clinton as a
[01:48:03.080 --> 01:48:06.680]  puppet they know how to protect their people they know how to silence people
[01:48:06.680 --> 01:48:10.680]  who are getting you know feet you know there was the transportation secretary
[01:48:10.680 --> 01:48:15.640]  that was killed in the plane crash in in Bosnia that had a bullet in his head and
[01:48:15.640 --> 01:48:18.880]  that had to be covered up look at all the people that got educated there on
[01:48:18.880 --> 01:48:25.440]  the ground of the JFK assassination so there are literally thousands of people
[01:48:25.440 --> 01:48:29.200]  who are saying yes to the establishment who know there's a control system and
[01:48:29.200 --> 01:48:33.520]  fear for their lives or there are the predictable yes men like in the media I
[01:48:33.520 --> 01:48:38.120]  don't think even though all of the left-wing and in pro-government media
[01:48:38.120 --> 01:48:41.360]  follows the government dictate I don't think for a minute that all those
[01:48:41.360 --> 01:48:45.200]  liberal reporters are knowing conspirators but I do think they're
[01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:48.720]  intimidated by knowing that they're gonna lose their jobs in fact they got
[01:48:48.720 --> 01:48:52.600]  hired because they were predictable liberals they don't have to be instructed
[01:48:52.600 --> 01:48:58.160]  on everything they will generally do what's I agree let me throw you this
[01:48:58.160 --> 01:49:02.760]  piece of intel a couple days ago as you know the 58-year-old healthy Russian
[01:49:02.760 --> 01:49:06.960]  intelligence chief who's been leading operations in Syria and Ukraine magically
[01:49:06.960 --> 01:49:15.640]  dies they're not saying how well both the US and the KGB or the follow-on you
[01:49:15.640 --> 01:49:20.960]  know services there have a very sophisticated array of ways of killing
[01:49:20.960 --> 01:49:25.800]  people either through injection through air aerosols and if the West did kill
[01:49:25.800 --> 01:49:31.920]  him that is quite a shot across the belt it is but we remember Russia Putin is
[01:49:31.920 --> 01:49:38.080]  showing surprising restraint from the shut the shoot down of the sq-204 by
[01:49:38.080 --> 01:49:42.120]  Turkey so this is meant obviously is what I thought a provocation to bloody the
[01:49:42.120 --> 01:49:47.680]  Russians knows yeah and basically the US wants a war with Russia and China they
[01:49:47.680 --> 01:49:51.000]  want to provoke that but they cannot be seen to starting it and that's why I
[01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:54.960]  don't think it's going to start in the Middle East I think they're blooding
[01:49:54.960 --> 01:49:58.920]  their nose they're they're irritating Russia they're making the US out to be a
[01:49:58.920 --> 01:50:03.840]  bully which we are around the world but you know the US can't start this war
[01:50:03.840 --> 01:50:08.840]  they got to make the US appear to be the victim of the war with Russia and China
[01:50:08.840 --> 01:50:14.680]  one of my producers had a question they they wondered if the West would ever do
[01:50:14.680 --> 01:50:23.000]  a false flag and blame Russia I don't think so we remember they don't that
[01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:26.560]  would only give the US an excuse to attack Russia and they can't get what
[01:50:26.560 --> 01:50:30.080]  they want by attacking Russia they have to wait till Russia and China attack us
[01:50:30.080 --> 01:50:34.240]  so that we look like the victim only does come out of their bunkers and say we
[01:50:34.240 --> 01:50:38.320]  didn't know this was going to happen and now our only solution is to join in a
[01:50:38.320 --> 01:50:42.880]  militarized global government and I think that's that's right so we're out of

[01:54:20.680 --> 01:54:22.680]  oh
[01:54:22.680 --> 01:54:26.240]  I'm going to shoot a special report after broadcast today and I'm gonna do a
[01:54:26.240 --> 01:54:30.680]  Facebook mentions as well hammering that we have to do the right thing and
[01:54:30.680 --> 01:54:35.520]  start impeachment proceedings against Obama I mean come on it's come out in
[01:54:35.520 --> 01:54:42.320]  mainstream news they have UPS planes contracted by the government to fly
[01:54:42.320 --> 01:54:48.640]  Syrian refugees in many of which are well they're almost all Sunnis none of them
[01:54:48.640 --> 01:54:52.720]  are Shiites and like one out of a couple hundred on average will be Christian the
[01:54:52.720 --> 01:54:58.880]  country's 12% Christian they're the persecuted group and Obama goes we got
[01:54:58.880 --> 01:55:05.040]  to be fair who we bring in and then they don't bring the Christians in I mean and
[01:55:05.040 --> 01:55:09.920]  then Soros is fun and persecution of Christians I mean what's weird is I'm
[01:55:09.920 --> 01:55:13.640]  up here seeing how bad they are and it sounds like it's cartoonish like I'm
[01:55:13.640 --> 01:55:18.600]  making it up but it's not they're worse than I'm saying I I'm mad at myself I
[01:55:18.600 --> 01:55:26.680]  don't have words to describe how evil Obama is and how mad I am that I didn't
[01:55:26.680 --> 01:55:32.880]  try to stop him getting elected I I'm just I am a pathetic liberal I'm just a
[01:55:32.880 --> 01:55:36.240]  gullibility and I'll be honest with you I wanted to see a black guy get elected
[01:55:36.240 --> 01:55:39.920]  compared to John McCain and thought maybe it would bring people together I mean I
[01:55:39.920 --> 01:55:43.880]  knew the globalist wanted to divide and conquer us but all the hype and all the
[01:55:43.880 --> 01:55:54.200]  love I mean I was against Obama but I just wasn't against him enough and I'm
[01:55:54.200 --> 01:55:58.840]  telling you I'm not getting fooled again man these people are evil evil evil evil
[01:55:58.840 --> 01:56:04.480]  evil I mean they are actually letting people in and directing them to just
[01:56:04.480 --> 01:56:09.520]  rape little girls to death shell women into sex slavery and just bring in all
[01:56:09.520 --> 01:56:13.520]  these men just rape women all over the place and the police won't even charge
[01:56:13.520 --> 01:56:16.760]  them in places like Sweden I mean that's a mainstream news they've ordered the
[01:56:16.760 --> 01:56:21.800]  Swedish police not to report Muslim rapes
[01:56:22.680 --> 01:56:28.360]  women made to run the gauntlet and attacks yeah that's AP now oh I reported
[01:56:28.360 --> 01:56:32.120]  it you know this weekend was a right-wing racist cook now it's in the
[01:56:32.120 --> 01:56:37.040]  New York Times and that's really the big story here they used to could cover
[01:56:37.040 --> 01:56:42.400]  stuff up they can't do it anymore because info wars.com reaches millions a
[01:56:42.400 --> 01:56:49.280]  day. Drudge report reaches tens of millions a day but frankly I cannot
[01:56:49.280 --> 01:56:54.160]  believe how many people we reach it is unbelievable now I could hardly get
[01:56:54.160 --> 01:56:59.600]  through the Phoenix airport I shook so many hands every race, color, and creed. I
[01:56:59.600 --> 01:57:04.320]  was inside the nation of Islam one of their main headquarters and I probably
[01:57:04.320 --> 01:57:07.200]  talked to 20 men and they were like I like to show last week I want you to
[01:57:07.200 --> 01:57:10.240]  do the blah blah blah I mean it's like and then they get they turn a computer on
[01:57:10.240 --> 01:57:14.080]  Alex Jones is playing like oh excuse us I mean it's funny you're like well what
[01:57:14.080 --> 01:57:16.640]  I mean people like what do you mean I don't like the issue of Islam they're
[01:57:16.640 --> 01:57:20.240]  anti-Semitic whatever whatever we can reach out to them and get them to come
[01:57:20.240 --> 01:57:23.400]  out against the New World Order and we agree with them about vaccines it
[01:57:23.400 --> 01:57:28.520]  doesn't matter the point is if we've even got the nation of Islam listening
[01:57:28.520 --> 01:57:33.480]  every day and in foreign governments and everything else it's amazing folks and
[01:57:33.480 --> 01:57:37.160]  it's by the grace of God we're even here on air so thank you for the prayers
[01:57:37.160 --> 01:57:41.280]  because when I tell you the good report that we're reaching so many people it's
[01:57:41.280 --> 01:57:46.000]  not for a power trip I want you to know we are to use the cheesy Star Wars
[01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:50.640]  analogy info wars didn't look for the fight I didn't want to be one of the
[01:57:50.640 --> 01:57:54.400]  main leaders I always was just trying to promote everybody but we've been pure
[01:57:54.400 --> 01:58:00.760]  of heart here and I mean we're in the X-wings on the attack run on the Death
[01:58:00.760 --> 01:58:06.040]  Star folks I mean we're it and there's other people out there as well and I
[01:58:06.040 --> 01:58:10.400]  don't know who's gonna shoot a missile down the down the shaft politically but
[01:58:10.400 --> 01:58:13.480]  I mean we're all in this together you better know there's not that many X-wings
[01:58:13.480 --> 01:58:22.240]  going through that trench at this level there's not and what really has the big
[01:58:22.240 --> 01:58:26.400]  effect is you out there you are what gives our engines more power our weapons
[01:58:26.400 --> 01:58:29.480]  more power in the fight spreading the word doing what you're doing get this
[01:58:29.480 --> 01:58:33.840]  article 75 times Obama broke the law during presidency and get it out to
[01:58:33.840 --> 01:58:39.360]  everybody now we need to hammer them with the truth and the crimes of this
[01:58:39.360 --> 01:58:44.080]  filthy degenerate group that's hijacked our country I mean these people are
[01:58:44.080 --> 01:58:53.680]  ruthless crazed criminals out to get us and it's that type of behavior that
[01:58:53.680 --> 01:58:56.800]  spurred me to do the research to develop a true
[01:58:56.800 --> 01:59:00.880]  nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children
[01:59:00.880 --> 01:59:05.320]  focus all of our children are hit with modern mind control television music
[01:59:05.320 --> 01:59:10.000]  fast food GMOs sugars you name it young humans have not yet developed their
[01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:14.640]  nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions it's no
[01:59:14.640 --> 01:59:18.200]  wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous
[01:59:18.200 --> 01:59:22.440]  psychotropic drugs working with my team we set out to find the best formula with
[01:59:22.440 --> 01:59:25.480]  the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take
[01:59:25.480 --> 01:59:29.040]  we worked with the leading manufacturer and nutritional supplements that are
[01:59:29.040 --> 01:59:32.800]  safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula

[02:00:01.440 --> 02:00:07.040]  network proudly presents the alex jones show because there's a war on for your
[02:00:07.040 --> 02:00:09.480]  mind

[02:00:26.320 --> 02:00:33.560]  but we encourage folks to be in the arena and so Kellan is very talented his
[02:00:33.560 --> 02:00:37.960]  dad's probably one of our best video editors and researchers Kellan McBreen
[02:00:37.960 --> 02:00:42.040]  with Rob Jacobson and others put together a joke piece on Coco the gorilla
[02:00:42.040 --> 02:00:45.840]  then we got Max Kaiser on the craziness in the markets we told you was coming
[02:00:45.840 --> 02:00:50.320]  George Soros saying prepare for the new 2008 yeah we're you gorge on trillions
[02:00:50.320 --> 02:00:56.440]  of taxpayer money snow into you I just I am traumatized by Soros and Hillary I'm

[02:01:17.680 --> 02:01:21.000]  climate change is happening on national TV at the Paris conference and all the
[02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.920]  obviously the gorilla didn't say that that's how done they think the public is
[02:01:23.920 --> 02:01:27.800]  we did this joke piece with Coco doing sign language saying turn your guns in
[02:01:27.800 --> 02:01:31.560]  and stuff I'm gonna narrate this for the radio audience it's pretty funny and we
[02:01:31.560 --> 02:01:35.080]  need to promote this video everywhere we're gonna post it on Facebook as well
[02:01:35.080 --> 02:01:40.800]  here it is last month Coco the gorilla who can talk with humans sound of the
[02:01:40.800 --> 02:01:44.440]  alarm on climate change and it can sell like gimme food or stuff like that now
[02:01:44.440 --> 02:01:51.120]  the age primate has more wisdom for humanity now the age primate will

[02:03:14.280 --> 02:03:18.240]  pretty ridiculous isn't it a guy in a gorilla suit telling you to turn your
[02:03:18.240 --> 02:03:24.200]  guns in well it's just as stupid for the UN at last month's climate conference
[02:03:24.200 --> 02:03:30.960]  in Paris to claim that Coco the great gorilla had come out and sign language
[02:03:30.960 --> 02:03:35.720]  calling for action on climate change they taught the gorilla what sign
[02:03:35.720 --> 02:03:40.600]  language to show to then claim that it was geopolitically aware of what was
[02:03:40.600 --> 02:03:46.120]  going on the world a total fraud on the people and you got to ask yourself how
[02:03:46.120 --> 02:03:51.000]  would they have the nerve to sell it on TV and radio and print all over the
[02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:57.480]  world that gorilla wants action you could claim a gorilla said go eat at
[02:03:57.480 --> 02:04:02.440]  McDonald's or wear green shirts on Tuesday I mean obviously most of us know
[02:04:02.440 --> 02:04:06.120]  this but what does it say about our fellow humans that they've dumbed us
[02:04:06.120 --> 02:04:10.160]  down to this point but why not they tell us that polar bears are all dying can't
[02:04:10.160 --> 02:04:12.960]  swim because the ice caps melted the ice caps the biggest they've ever been
[02:04:12.960 --> 02:04:16.740]  recorded polar bear numbers are up five full but they were in the 50s they tell
[02:04:16.740 --> 02:04:20.920]  us penguins can't swim to they're all dying none of us true they go look at
[02:04:20.920 --> 02:04:25.400]  icebergs they're melting the glaciers always melt that that happens every
[02:04:25.400 --> 02:04:32.440]  spring so that's why we illustrated this with Coco and it just shows how crazy
[02:04:32.440 --> 02:04:37.560]  things have gotten and how stupid they think we are I'm Alex shows was that
[02:04:37.560 --> 02:04:46.520]  Coco or was that Janet Reno or is that Hillary's girlfriend oh my gosh ladies
[02:04:46.520 --> 02:04:50.640]  and gentlemen we'll be back with Max Kaiser on the big news on the economy and

[02:05:42.800 --> 02:05:46.840]  Taliban among others the commitment behind the resolution says that we are a

[02:08:35.360 --> 02:08:43.080]  the resistance it was just a few years ago they promised us no one was coming
[02:08:43.080 --> 02:08:48.080]  after our guns just a few years ago they promised us that nobody wanted to get
[02:08:48.080 --> 02:08:52.760]  rid of cash just a few years ago they promised us the TSA would never be on
[02:08:52.760 --> 02:08:56.680]  the streets it was just a few years ago they promised us they never had force
[02:08:56.680 --> 02:09:00.680]  inoculations and it was insane if you thought it just a few years ago they
[02:09:00.680 --> 02:09:05.240]  said fluoride was good for you now they admit it's brain damaging you just a
[02:09:05.240 --> 02:09:09.640]  few years ago they denied everything now they come out and admit it but say it's
[02:09:09.640 --> 02:09:14.640]  good and that you're hateful and bad and racist if you don't agree with foreign
[02:09:14.640 --> 02:09:19.400]  insurance companies riding Obamacare to double and triple prices lower the
[02:09:19.400 --> 02:09:27.080]  quality of care and screw you over so in the first year of global Obamacare
[02:09:27.080 --> 02:09:32.880]  just here in the US global profits for insurance companies on our backs went up
[02:09:32.880 --> 02:09:37.400]  forty seven percent I know major hospital chain owners and others and they
[02:09:37.400 --> 02:09:40.920]  just go Alex you're absolutely right it's all written by insurance companies
[02:09:40.920 --> 02:09:44.800]  and big chains to shut down all the little mom and pops and rape everyone
[02:09:44.800 --> 02:09:52.760]  and they tell me Alex I've never made more money it's unbelievable and it's
[02:09:52.760 --> 02:09:59.400]  all done through social engineering in class warfare where the poor socialists
[02:09:59.400 --> 02:10:03.480]  actually think they're getting something free and under Obamacare they get rid of
[02:10:03.480 --> 02:10:09.080]  real charity care that's on record and law that's just an example and they get
[02:10:09.080 --> 02:10:11.960]  up there and go there are no death panels yeah there are now they admit it
[02:10:11.960 --> 02:10:15.440]  one week after it passes they have to cover a newsweek the case for killing
[02:10:15.440 --> 02:10:18.040]  granny Bill Gates goes yeah there are death panels
[02:10:18.040 --> 02:10:22.960]  sucker we got it and you can't keep your doctor and we're gonna increase your
[02:10:22.960 --> 02:10:26.760]  prices and we're gonna lower the quality of it and you know what there is a
[02:10:26.760 --> 02:10:31.640]  penalty started kicking in for businesses above 50 people last year now it
[02:10:31.640 --> 02:10:37.200]  kicks in to businesses period and then oh next year to everybody upwards of
[02:10:37.200 --> 02:10:42.600]  $5,000 a person that you don't ensure of course they just cut your pay or lay
[02:10:42.600 --> 02:10:46.640]  you off or make you go to part-time they admit that part-time jobs in America
[02:10:46.640 --> 02:10:51.120]  just search this doubled in the last three years of Obamacare getting phased
[02:10:51.120 --> 02:10:56.640]  in like slow death they just drip the poison in where you kind of feel sleepy
[02:10:56.640 --> 02:11:00.480]  and lay down they don't want to kill you right away they're gonna do it real
[02:11:00.480 --> 02:11:05.280]  slow so nobody notices everything's done soft kill oh we're just gonna start
[02:11:05.280 --> 02:11:10.040]  taking guns selectively now outside of law just recommendations executive
[02:11:10.040 --> 02:11:15.360]  order and then of course as they take your free speech as they take your guns
[02:11:15.360 --> 02:11:20.200]  oh we have to federalize your pension funds to keep them safe oh big banks
[02:11:20.200 --> 02:11:24.200]  have to take money out of your account now and just give it to themselves like
[02:11:24.200 --> 02:11:28.440]  they're doing in Europe it's all being announced oh it's totally normal now
[02:11:28.440 --> 02:11:32.880]  we'll charge you to have money in the bank it's totally normal it's totally
[02:11:32.880 --> 02:11:37.160]  normal your children belong to the state I'm a woman with short hair I'm
[02:11:37.160 --> 02:11:44.640]  Rachel Maddow I'm the authority Obama Congress time for you to get in line

[02:11:50.200 --> 02:11:55.600]  them stinger messels neocon Republicans running Obama you tell a Democrat that
[02:11:55.600 --> 02:11:58.440]  they're on too big a power trip they look at you through feeble little lies
[02:11:58.440 --> 02:12:02.520]  and giggle and go yeah just mad you're not in power I had a prominent Democrat
[02:12:02.520 --> 02:12:07.920]  this morning but I was on the phone with on some issues here in town and he was
[02:12:07.920 --> 02:12:11.560]  giggling and laughing at me about the executive order and a betting I was
[02:12:11.560 --> 02:12:17.800]  upset and I said you know full well this is a screw everybody over it is a
[02:12:17.800 --> 02:12:22.000]  horrible thing and and he's like oh I know I'm just having fun oh god it's
[02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:27.760]  sick and hung up at the end of our conversation I mean they all know it's
[02:12:27.760 --> 02:12:34.520]  just a big sick joke well everything it's screwed over and we go from a
[02:12:34.520 --> 02:12:42.160]  innovation economy to a conquest economy I'm gonna go back to Kaiser for the
[02:12:42.160 --> 02:12:47.400]  balance the hour Max Kaiser comms indicated TV host RT BBC Al Jazeera you
[02:12:47.400 --> 02:12:54.360]  name it filmmaker and he did predict what's now happening in bond markets and
[02:12:54.360 --> 02:12:58.440]  stock markets a few years ago he said it would happen by last year it ended up
[02:12:58.440 --> 02:13:03.360]  starting a little bit late but fortune favors the bold he's right about 90% of
[02:13:03.360 --> 02:13:08.040]  the time and just happens a little bit later than he said and so now Soros it's
[02:13:08.040 --> 02:13:14.080]  time for 2008 all over again they only announced right at the end for everybody
[02:13:14.080 --> 02:13:18.920]  so people go Soros is so smart oh my gosh what a wonderful Nazi collaborator
[02:13:18.920 --> 02:13:25.800]  China's 29 minutes of chaos stunned brokers and a race to sell trillions
[02:13:25.800 --> 02:13:30.440]  disappearing our stock market dropping you know close to a thousand points now
[02:13:30.440 --> 02:13:37.000]  being pumped back up AFP fears for world economy wreak carnage on oil stocks
[02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:41.680]  oh I'm the fear monger when I shoot videos and articles about how the
[02:13:41.680 --> 02:13:45.360]  collapse has to come because all the experts basically say it's coming I
[02:13:45.360 --> 02:13:49.440]  mean we've got more derivatives we had 2000 people go you fear monger it'd be
[02:13:49.440 --> 02:13:53.720]  like saying of some 89 year old man who's had 14 heart attacks takes up
[02:13:53.720 --> 02:13:58.240]  smoking cigarettes again and starts marching up a mountain you say hey I
[02:13:58.240 --> 02:14:02.160]  think you might not you might have a heart attack pretty soon what fear
[02:14:02.160 --> 02:14:06.080]  mongering hey it's like saying Dick Cheney might have some heart problems I
[02:14:06.080 --> 02:14:09.200]  think Dick Cheney might have a heart problem in the future that's
[02:14:09.200 --> 02:14:13.560]  incredible fear mongering next he's gonna say Fisher in the ocean that crazy
[02:14:13.560 --> 02:14:21.000]  Alex he said Obama'd come for our guns and now he is what a cook that cook Ted
[02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:25.280]  Cruz said Obama cared shut down the economy oh it is now but newsweek's
[02:14:25.280 --> 02:14:32.440]  calling him Hitler say what you want about Ted Cruz eloquent smart informed
[02:14:32.440 --> 02:14:36.480]  Hitler he's not Obama is becoming like Hitler and I'm pointing out the
[02:14:36.480 --> 02:14:42.520]  Republican neocons run him I'm ranting Max Kaiser we live in this world where
[02:14:42.520 --> 02:14:46.480]  other economies are in deep recession or depression or war the West is
[02:14:46.480 --> 02:14:50.520]  financing chaos admittedly to come in with multinationals and take over
[02:14:50.520 --> 02:14:55.080]  they're lining Europe up for collapse in many areas they got 45% unemployment in
[02:14:55.080 --> 02:15:00.520]  Spain for men and then they're telling us everything's fine Max Kaiser you're
[02:15:00.520 --> 02:15:04.240]  a fear monger Alex Jones is a fear monger you know what Max I wish I was a
[02:15:04.240 --> 02:15:08.440]  fear monger I mean I wish I wish I was wrong I wish you were wrong the real
[02:15:08.440 --> 02:15:13.120]  state of the economy is hellish isn't it hey Alex how's it going what's
[02:15:13.120 --> 02:15:18.520]  happening down there at Austin where are you joining us from Max Kaiser I am in
[02:15:18.520 --> 02:15:24.800]  the city of London in the United Kingdom where Donald Trump of course is in big
[02:15:24.800 --> 02:15:32.000]  trouble because he has angered people with his comments about immigration and
[02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:36.720]  they might ban him from entering the United Kingdom so you know we don't
[02:15:36.720 --> 02:15:40.200]  want Donald Trump in the United Kingdom Alex he he's saying things that just
[02:15:40.200 --> 02:15:45.280]  just you're gonna make the people here cower in in in fear and what a free
[02:15:45.280 --> 02:15:48.440]  country where they're arresting preachers that criticize radical Islam and
[02:15:48.440 --> 02:15:52.560]  putting them on trial and banning street demonstrations against sexually
[02:15:52.560 --> 02:15:56.280]  mutilating women and now they want to ban they ban Michael Savage and Donald
[02:15:56.280 --> 02:16:01.320]  Trump boy that sounds like a really free country to me well the speech laws in
[02:16:01.320 --> 02:16:06.120]  the United Kingdom are some of the most oppressive in the world I know that the
[02:16:06.120 --> 02:16:12.960]  they're constantly attempting to censor my show that we do here in London oh
[02:16:12.960 --> 02:16:16.560]  really tell us about that I forgot you have a big professional production there
[02:16:16.560 --> 02:16:23.840]  used to be yeah we did a we did a report about George Osborne is the
[02:16:23.840 --> 02:16:29.120]  Chancellor of the Exchequer and reserve over there folks go ahead sorry no no
[02:16:29.120 --> 02:16:34.480]  treasury treasury exactly so he did a a scheme where the government is
[02:16:34.480 --> 02:16:38.960]  subsidizing housing because the entire economy here is based on a property
[02:16:38.960 --> 02:16:43.720]  bubble there's no manufacturing to speak of there's no diversity in the economy
[02:16:43.720 --> 02:16:47.320]  it's almost entirely based on this housing bubble property bubble that's
[02:16:47.320 --> 02:16:51.920]  almost exclusively in London so he came out with another government subsidy
[02:16:51.920 --> 02:16:56.080]  like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to pump up this bubble and we said on my show
[02:16:56.080 --> 02:17:01.960]  that this is a Ponzi scheme so his office sent a letter trying to shut us
[02:17:01.960 --> 02:17:08.760]  down because we refer to his program as a Ponzi scheme the next day in fact the
[02:17:08.760 --> 02:17:15.440]  Bank of England issued a report saying that George Osborne scheme is it comes
[02:17:15.440 --> 02:17:20.880]  closest to replicating a Ponzi scheme so then they they went away well I mean
[02:17:20.880 --> 02:17:26.160]  these governments legalizing beyond fresh reserve banking with derivatives and
[02:17:26.160 --> 02:17:30.680]  credit default swaps I mean that is beyond the Ponzi scheme so I mean the
[02:17:30.680 --> 02:17:38.120]  you're saying yeah in the UK you have the ability to sell the same bond an
[02:17:38.120 --> 02:17:43.480]  infinite number of times in the United States you're limited you can't sell the
[02:17:43.480 --> 02:17:48.720]  same bond an infinite number of times you can sell it a few times and claim
[02:17:48.720 --> 02:17:53.760]  that it has a collateral value but in the UK and this is why all of the major
[02:17:53.760 --> 02:17:59.120]  banks and all the major countries treasuries outsource their fraud to the
[02:17:59.120 --> 02:18:04.760]  UK this is why the UK is responsible for the Lehman collapse the AIG collapse
[02:18:04.760 --> 02:18:09.680]  the Bernie Madoff collapse the London Whale from JP Morgan collapsed because
[02:18:09.680 --> 02:18:13.640]  everyone outsources their fraud to the UK because the UK is where you can commit
[02:18:13.640 --> 02:18:19.280]  egregious fraudulent financial behavior like what's this particular fraud is
[02:18:19.280 --> 02:18:22.560]  called infinite rehypotheic and then don't they don't they compete with
[02:18:22.560 --> 02:18:28.040]  Frankfurt and others and the Swiss as well and to be the most corrupt well
[02:18:28.040 --> 02:18:32.280]  you know this is a funny joke because they're having a referendum to decide
[02:18:32.280 --> 02:18:37.440]  whether the UK should pull out of the EU and if they do the country will
[02:18:37.440 --> 02:18:41.400]  completely collapse because Frankfurt will become the financial center of
[02:18:41.400 --> 02:18:48.360]  Europe the euro is incredibly bigger than the pound and you know the UK is
[02:18:48.360 --> 02:18:53.400]  sinking into really this kind of infinitesimally important whenever I
[02:18:53.400 --> 02:18:57.480]  leave the UK if I go to the US or I go anywhere in the world it's remarkable
[02:18:57.480 --> 02:19:02.480]  you just never hear about the UK ever it's it's a completely insignificant
[02:19:02.480 --> 02:19:07.880]  country every way except when they bow down to the states and do the stage
[02:19:07.880 --> 02:19:11.880]  bidding other than that there's almost no reason for the UK to exist well I'll
[02:19:11.880 --> 02:19:14.760]  say this Max Kaiser I want to come back and ask you about the Muslim crisis to
[02:19:14.760 --> 02:19:17.040]  get into what's happening in China in the markets that's why you're really here
[02:19:17.040 --> 02:19:22.600]  but I was in the UK just a few months ago and I mean I'm telling you almost all
[02:19:22.600 --> 02:19:25.880]  the taxi drivers at the airport both times I was there and then back from
[02:19:25.880 --> 02:19:31.880]  Europe would not give people fares or would try to double triple charge what
[02:19:31.880 --> 02:19:37.560]  they were supposed to and they were very hateful towards Westerners and again
[02:19:37.560 --> 02:19:41.040]  in my past experience you know Muslims and people were not rude and hateful
[02:19:41.040 --> 02:19:44.160]  like this and we have all the mass raping and things going on I wanted to
[02:19:44.160 --> 02:19:50.520]  ask you what the climate is and why all this is going on and and just the
[02:19:50.520 --> 02:19:54.960]  piratical actions that I witnessed there but but first what's happening with
[02:19:54.960 --> 02:19:59.600]  the economy with Max Kaiser straight ahead China in big trouble are you

[02:24:14.280 --> 02:24:18.240]  down they started going back up but now the new headline Associated Press USA
[02:24:18.240 --> 02:24:27.080]  today stocks plunge is dow down 300 Nasdaq in correction so this is the type
[02:24:27.080 --> 02:24:32.360]  of stuff that's happening right now January 7th 2016 now remember a few
[02:24:32.360 --> 02:24:38.320]  months ago they had that glitch no that was computers programmed to then stop
[02:24:38.320 --> 02:24:44.120]  trading to stop a plunge well now they've stopped trading on certain things
[02:24:44.120 --> 02:24:49.440]  and admitting it's not a glitch so I love how they call everybody conspiracy
[02:24:49.440 --> 02:24:53.360]  theorist including myself when we said that that was an automatic default
[02:24:53.360 --> 02:24:58.360]  system and now they just admitted it's just it's wild how discredited they are
[02:24:58.360 --> 02:25:04.800]  I mean MSNBC has on average 126,000 viewers an hour over 24 hours
[02:25:04.800 --> 02:25:09.520]  ladies and gentlemen I can do a YouTube video in my backyard and it gets half a
[02:25:09.520 --> 02:25:18.440]  million views on average Facebook mentions we have in the last week six and
[02:25:18.440 --> 02:25:24.480]  a half million views out of like 10 videos one of them has 1.8 million I'm
[02:25:24.480 --> 02:25:30.560]  not bragging about us look at mainstream media they're already dead Max
[02:25:30.560 --> 02:25:33.520]  Kaiser what do you make of this financially obviously and the fact that
[02:25:33.520 --> 02:25:38.080]  they keep just denying financial facts to people I mean you've come out and said
[02:25:38.080 --> 02:25:42.440]  LIBOR before it came out fixing interest rates fixing currency rates you know
[02:25:42.440 --> 02:25:46.400]  then the Rolling Stone does act like oh my gosh they're God they need to pull it
[02:25:46.400 --> 02:25:50.800]  surprise you only did it 10 years late I mean isn't it too little too late but
[02:25:50.800 --> 02:25:54.640]  but now they just admit they're fixing the stock market Max Kaiser well these
[02:25:54.640 --> 02:25:59.240]  are Wall Street jihadis you know these are financial terrorists they use
[02:25:59.240 --> 02:26:04.280]  weapons of mass financial destruction to blow up the economy and it's and it's
[02:26:04.280 --> 02:26:10.960]  and it's being destroyed and look this guy Fisher I sent you the article on
[02:26:10.960 --> 02:26:17.320]  this Richard Fisher former Federal Reserve member he came out on CNBC this
[02:26:17.320 --> 02:26:23.000]  week and said the whole thing was a scam in 2009 we front run or we front
[02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:27.840]  loaded the market with trillions of dollars of funny money to create a so
[02:26:27.840 --> 02:26:33.000]  called wealth effect and he went on he went on national TV the squawk on the
[02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:36.960]  street and admitted it we have the video in front of us go ahead right he just
[02:26:36.960 --> 02:26:41.880]  said it with the wealth effect is is the idea that if you make the wealthiest
[02:26:41.880 --> 02:26:47.240]  even wealthier that the economy will benefit well that didn't happen the the
[02:26:47.240 --> 02:26:52.640]  underclass the permanent American underclass got bigger the number of
[02:26:52.640 --> 02:26:58.920]  people that are participating in the employment dropped to record lows and
[02:26:58.920 --> 02:27:04.400]  the wealth and income gap skyrocketed so his theory that well if you give the
[02:27:04.400 --> 02:27:09.960]  top 2,000 bankers in America committed massive fraud and they crashed the
[02:27:09.960 --> 02:27:15.160]  market in 2008 so we gave them this now been all added up we gave them 15
[02:27:15.160 --> 02:27:19.720]  trillion dollars to make them whole so that they didn't have to suffer any
[02:27:19.720 --> 02:27:24.280]  losses as a matter of fact they tripled and quadrupled their wealth and now here
[02:27:24.280 --> 02:27:29.240]  we are in 2015 2016 and I'm on TV and I'd like to tell you that it didn't work
[02:27:29.240 --> 02:27:35.360]  the economy did not pick up there's no meaningful tax revenues to pay off this
[02:27:35.360 --> 02:27:39.640]  debt that we've accumulated and he expects markets to crash because
[02:27:39.640 --> 02:27:43.320]  everything he did was been a complete failure Paul Krugman at the New York
[02:27:43.320 --> 02:27:47.200]  Times he's been a cheerleader for this for seven or eight years he's a complete
[02:27:47.200 --> 02:27:54.560]  nutter charlatan who is a financial jihadist as I would he's part of like the
[02:27:54.560 --> 02:28:01.000]  Paul who believes that by the way to create an economic growth is by printing
[02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:07.560]  trillions and trillions of dollars worth of a paper that any two-year-old can
[02:28:07.560 --> 02:28:11.320]  tell you would reduce the purchasing power of that paper but it's even worse
[02:28:11.320 --> 02:28:15.480]  as you point out they give it to the ultra-rich elites who then make sure it
[02:28:15.480 --> 02:28:20.000]  doesn't even trickle down the public because inflation they just don't care
[02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:24.400]  they just know what they're doing in poverishing us on purpose laughing at
[02:28:24.400 --> 02:28:27.840]  us and then have there's two numbers to look at you have the money supplied
[02:28:27.840 --> 02:28:31.680]  number which went up with the trillions and trillions of dollars but then you
[02:28:31.680 --> 02:28:35.520]  have what's called the money velocity number which tracks is the money
[02:28:35.520 --> 02:28:40.840]  circulating and that's hit new all-time love so clearly as you point out when
[02:28:40.840 --> 02:28:45.520]  you give these guys a few trillion dollars they go out and they buy a mid-digly
[02:28:45.520 --> 02:28:49.360]  awning was recently sold at an auction house in New York for a hundred and
[02:28:49.360 --> 02:28:54.080]  seventy million dollars this is a few scraps of paint on a canvas written by
[02:28:54.080 --> 02:28:59.000]  you know someone did in Paris with a gliani quite you know a number of years
[02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:03.040]  ago and they finance fake leftist propaganda about raising taxes on rich
[02:29:03.040 --> 02:29:06.720]  people that's really to raise taxes on middle-class to further destroy them
[02:29:06.720 --> 02:29:10.920]  but that's just a joke I mean Apple Computer has hundreds of billions of dollars
[02:29:10.920 --> 02:29:14.840]  sitting offshore tax exempt they don't bring it on onshore because they don't
[02:29:14.840 --> 02:29:19.560]  want to pay tax so how was that not part of being a financial jihadist I was
[02:29:19.560 --> 02:29:24.400]  Tim Cook not a financial terrorist he's doing the same damage as ISIS is doing
[02:29:24.400 --> 02:29:27.160]  it's just he's doing it with weapons of mass financial I want to ask you in the

[02:33:51.400 --> 02:33:56.560]  pep talk but just really need to gauge what's happening and not become
[02:33:56.560 --> 02:34:00.680]  comfortable with all the dictatorial power grabs not become comfortable with
[02:34:00.680 --> 02:34:03.840]  all the gun grabbing not to become comfortable with all the medical
[02:34:03.840 --> 02:34:08.160]  tyranny not to become comfortable with Obamacare and really realize it's only
[02:34:08.160 --> 02:34:12.720]  gonna get worse we've got a push back or it's gonna get worse it's not gonna have

[02:34:50.520 --> 02:34:53.600]  a hatred of the West that they really ought to think about what they're

[02:36:53.640 --> 02:36:57.200]  about Bitcoin and then he wants to bring that up I mean I think things like this
[02:36:57.200 --> 02:37:00.920]  are the answer to the Federal Reserve monopoly I just don't know if Bitcoin's
[02:37:00.920 --> 02:37:04.680]  it I just don't want to promote it then have it go south someday but it's gonna
[02:37:04.680 --> 02:37:08.080]  go up it's gonna go down it's away for the general public I guess to get in on
[02:37:08.080 --> 02:37:11.200]  speculation the globalist own control but I just don't like the secret
[02:37:11.200 --> 02:37:14.840]  providence of Bitcoin I wonder if Max Kaiser really knows but we're about to
[02:37:14.840 --> 02:37:21.280]  go back to him what I want to say here is it's way up right now in its history

[02:38:21.360 --> 02:38:25.080]  quality lowest price and pay the bills around here it's financing so much

[02:38:57.640 --> 02:39:02.320]  all right max I got a bunch of questions I want to get to with you what's next in
[02:39:02.320 --> 02:39:06.360]  the economy what's going on with China why is this happening now is Soros
[02:39:06.360 --> 02:39:10.440]  right I mean obviously he says there's crashes all the time to manipulate stuff
[02:39:10.440 --> 02:39:13.880]  and has brought down more countries than you know the Germans could in World
[02:39:13.880 --> 02:39:16.800]  War two which he also fought on their side of course we can't forget that
[02:39:16.800 --> 02:39:26.040]  wonderful person where is all this going is Soros right well yeah I do want to
[02:39:26.040 --> 02:39:30.320]  talk about Bitcoin at some point but to get to your question about Soros he did
[02:39:30.320 --> 02:39:36.160]  come out this week and say that this looks like 2008 all over again and I
[02:39:36.160 --> 02:39:41.200]  guess what's different now is that we have the Saudi the Saudi the Kingdom of
[02:39:41.200 --> 02:39:47.480]  Saudi Arabia is now on the verge of collapse and the US is really picked
[02:39:47.480 --> 02:39:52.240]  to fight with Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia firstly tried to undermine the US
[02:39:52.240 --> 02:39:56.680]  fracking industry by crashing the price of oil themselves because they are the
[02:39:56.680 --> 02:40:03.320]  the swing producer in the OPEC cartel but once the price of oil started to
[02:40:03.320 --> 02:40:08.800]  crack it unleashed geopolitical tensions everywhere and brought Russia and China
[02:40:08.800 --> 02:40:17.400]  in Iran is now taking an adversarial position against Saudi Arabia so this
[02:40:17.400 --> 02:40:25.320]  is really quite epic and the US is at a loss because it's very difficult for
[02:40:25.320 --> 02:40:29.360]  them to support Saudi Arabia when they're beheading people every day dozens
[02:40:29.360 --> 02:40:33.120]  and dozens of people but they have a long-standing antagonism toward Iran
[02:40:33.120 --> 02:40:40.080]  so that's of course problematic Russia is on the side of Iran but Russia is
[02:40:40.080 --> 02:40:46.440]  supplying the US with vital intelligence in killing off the jihadis and the
[02:40:46.440 --> 02:40:53.160]  extremists in Syria so that's a bit of a problem so I'd say unlike 2008 this is
[02:40:53.160 --> 02:40:56.520]  the big difference this time is that look at the price of oil it's crashing
[02:40:56.520 --> 02:41:00.680]  down this means that all the fracking rigs in America are not profitable it's
[02:41:00.680 --> 02:41:04.720]  a complete waste of money for one it means that these big oil industry
[02:41:04.720 --> 02:41:09.920]  titans the big companies are losing money hand over fist and of course because
[02:41:09.920 --> 02:41:14.760]  oil is the most traded commodity in the world you see the stock markets are I
[02:41:14.760 --> 02:41:21.400]  think reflecting in large part the fact that oil is is is down and the Chinese
[02:41:21.400 --> 02:41:27.640]  economy is down Chinese economy has obviously been the beneficiary of a
[02:41:27.640 --> 02:41:32.680]  multi-year money pumping bubble and artificial currency suppression through
[02:41:32.680 --> 02:41:36.920]  pegging their currency to the dollar which gave them this an enormous export
[02:41:36.920 --> 02:41:42.680]  business for a number of years but now that is unwinding and it's a huge you
[02:41:42.680 --> 02:41:47.200]  know if you remember Alex the Rube Goldberg machines we used to build as
[02:41:47.200 --> 02:41:50.920]  kids you know are you you build these extravagant little machines where you to
[02:41:50.920 --> 02:41:56.480]  get the marble across the road you know he goes through 20 different bells and
[02:41:56.480 --> 02:42:01.880]  whistles and trap doors everything is connected in a very esoteric way is a
[02:42:01.880 --> 02:42:07.760]  business yeah a Byzantine way once it starts to collapse it all falls down so
[02:42:07.760 --> 02:42:12.640]  we have the the effect of a big bubble being blown that we've all benefited
[02:42:12.640 --> 02:42:17.640]  from for 20 years but now that's it's become it's coming unglued and so it's
[02:42:17.640 --> 02:42:23.040]  on it's on the way down and unfortunately the the genesis of this has
[02:42:23.040 --> 02:42:26.760]  been criminality and but there's no attempt to put the bankers in jail
[02:42:26.760 --> 02:42:31.440]  instead they believe that their policies need to be tweaked that they need to
[02:42:31.440 --> 02:42:35.040]  print more money this is a huge fallacy you know if you want to call it the
[02:42:35.040 --> 02:42:39.360]  liberal fallacy is that they believe in Paul Krugman at the New York Times being
[02:42:39.360 --> 02:42:43.960]  a good example that these problems can be solved by printing more money they
[02:42:43.960 --> 02:42:47.600]  refuse to accept the fact that the problems aren't the result of printing
[02:42:47.600 --> 02:42:53.320]  money and not having a sound economy with sound money and so let me say this to
[02:42:53.320 --> 02:42:56.680]  you let me say this to you you're obviously a shrewd guy or a top stock
[02:42:56.680 --> 02:43:00.160]  broker invented the Hollywood Stock Exchange is one of the models of the
[02:43:00.160 --> 02:43:03.560]  virtual trading systems and you know you're a big fish you know a lot of
[02:43:03.560 --> 02:43:07.720]  famous people you know the Soros's the Baldwin's all of them so you're an
[02:43:07.720 --> 02:43:13.400]  insider to a certain extent but I think because I've had dinner with you I've
[02:43:13.400 --> 02:43:20.240]  hung out with you quite a bit I mean I know you're sharp but obviously and I'm
[02:43:20.240 --> 02:43:23.720]  not being condescending I mean you know they're not failing you know Krugman's
[02:43:23.720 --> 02:43:27.280]  not failing this has all been beautifully planned they admit it's been
[02:43:27.280 --> 02:43:31.600]  beautifully planned to implode the whole world give themselves the aid to save
[02:43:31.600 --> 02:43:36.320]  the world over and over again every decade and to consolidate power create a
[02:43:36.320 --> 02:43:40.080]  global cashless society with her tax exempt and control everyone through
[02:43:40.080 --> 02:43:46.800]  electronic gulags the term you coined the casino gulag and to basically take
[02:43:46.800 --> 02:43:50.680]  over the whole planet's resources with carbon taxes selectively enforced to
[02:43:50.680 --> 02:43:56.960]  shut down all competition they are devastating tacticians they are the
[02:43:56.960 --> 02:44:03.960]  greatest evil the others ever faced they are Hitler Stalin Mao rolled into one
[02:44:03.960 --> 02:44:09.480]  we are in devastatingly bad shape they are vicious and only admitting just how
[02:44:09.480 --> 02:44:12.960]  hardcore and premeditated they are will we defeat them it's easy to say Paul
[02:44:12.960 --> 02:44:17.400]  Krugman's full of bull or everybody else is full of bull lying to them they're
[02:44:17.400 --> 02:44:22.360]  not they're not dumb they're lying to their enemy I mean you know that's
[02:44:22.360 --> 02:44:26.320]  what's happening sorry go ahead yeah let me address that point that you're
[02:44:26.320 --> 02:44:31.800]  making so what you're you're suggesting is that these guys it's not that they're
[02:44:31.800 --> 02:44:37.800]  just dumb or stupid or there's a premeditation involved there's very
[02:44:37.800 --> 02:44:43.840]  the calculated analysis and they're ripping people off blind and that is a
[02:44:43.840 --> 02:44:51.440]  byproduct of what I believe to be the case where these folks are inculcated
[02:44:51.440 --> 02:44:56.600]  or indoctrinated in what you could call market fundamentalism in other words
[02:44:56.600 --> 02:45:03.600]  take a Paul Krugman for example yes he is not a dumb guy but it's not that he's
[02:45:03.600 --> 02:45:09.360]  so much doing this by a premeditation but he has been indoctrinated in the
[02:45:09.360 --> 02:45:16.320]  belief that what he is doing is in God's that's that's the religion I think
[02:45:16.320 --> 02:45:19.440]  for the but but I believe that they believe that I think that they that's
[02:45:19.440 --> 02:45:25.080]  why I equate them to suicide bombers are equal to suicide bankers cultists okay
[02:45:25.080 --> 02:45:29.120]  they're cultists suicide bombers believe that they are doing they're gonna kill
[02:45:29.120 --> 02:45:33.240]  themselves and people around them because they believe in their fanaticism
[02:45:33.240 --> 02:45:39.280]  and they believe they misquote the Quran and they they same thing with market
[02:45:39.280 --> 02:45:42.240]  fundamentalists they would read Adam Smith's wealth of nations and draw
[02:45:42.240 --> 02:45:46.160]  completely sure let's expand on that they say it's free market when they
[02:45:46.160 --> 02:45:50.960]  create fraudulent counterfeit financial instruments and then scapegoat free
[02:45:50.960 --> 02:45:54.960]  market as you pointed out explain to people that there was gonna real free
[02:45:54.960 --> 02:46:00.200]  market system versus this cooked rig thing where the top six or seven big
[02:46:00.200 --> 02:46:06.160]  banks are exempt from taxes and can create fraud that we back up and pay
[02:46:06.160 --> 02:46:10.040]  for and too big to fail that's the opposite of free market there's two
[02:46:10.040 --> 02:46:15.680]  major schools of economics the past hundred years one is socialism one is
[02:46:15.680 --> 02:46:20.480]  capitalism in socialism the state makes sure that everyone is provided for and
[02:46:20.480 --> 02:46:24.400]  you don't have entrepreneurs breaking out and becoming billionaires then there's
[02:46:24.400 --> 02:46:28.120]  capitalism where you have people breaking out and becoming billionaires
[02:46:28.120 --> 02:46:34.040]  but there's a lot of people who are the losers and the there's risks and there's
[02:46:34.040 --> 02:46:40.920]  rewards now that system of economics in America served well for a long time but
[02:46:40.920 --> 02:46:45.160]  what happened starting 40 years ago when the US went off the gold standard and we
[02:46:45.160 --> 02:46:49.720]  brought in monitors monetarism which is a new this is cultist religion of
[02:46:49.720 --> 02:46:54.040]  worshiping central banks the we brought in this idea that anytime the economy
[02:46:54.040 --> 02:46:58.800]  slips or anytime the market slips that the monitor to monetarist overlords at
[02:46:58.800 --> 02:47:04.440]  the Fed are gonna prevent that risk from appearing in anybody's bank account so
[02:47:04.440 --> 02:47:07.760]  they keep bailing out the banks they keep bailing out the stock market and
[02:47:07.760 --> 02:47:11.880]  that's the complete opposite of free market capitalism it is much more
[02:47:11.880 --> 02:47:17.280]  similar to socialism in fact America is a socialist country it's a communist
[02:47:17.280 --> 02:47:22.040]  country run by the Politburo called this Federal Reserve Bank and the 12
[02:47:22.040 --> 02:47:25.720]  members of the central banking and the federal open market committee the price
[02:47:25.720 --> 02:47:29.840]  discovery that goes into real free market capitalism has been abolished the
[02:47:29.840 --> 02:47:34.120]  stock market is not priced based on earnings or value it's based on
[02:47:34.120 --> 02:47:39.560]  circulating free money by crooks the gold and silver market does not the
[02:47:39.560 --> 02:47:43.080]  demand for gold has never been higher but the price is down because it's not
[02:47:43.080 --> 02:47:49.280]  true price discovery because it's not how long can the artificiality go on it
[02:47:49.280 --> 02:47:56.720]  can go on until you have an event like 2008 where banks stop lending to each
[02:47:56.720 --> 02:48:01.440]  other because they don't believe the this fundamentalism anymore you know
[02:48:01.440 --> 02:48:05.840]  imagine two jihadis are in the desert and they they decide that they're not
[02:48:05.840 --> 02:48:10.320]  gonna kill each other and boom the jihadism dies well hobbyism is over
[02:48:10.320 --> 02:48:14.200]  because you can't find any more suckers to go blow themselves up well when they
[02:48:14.200 --> 02:48:17.600]  run out of people that are willing to commit this massive market fundamental
[02:48:17.600 --> 02:48:22.360]  fraud then there's you run out of suckers the emperor has no clothes and you
[02:48:22.360 --> 02:48:25.680]  start to see it on a wine and we're starting to see that now because these
[02:48:25.680 --> 02:48:30.040]  tend to happen in cycles around six or seven year cycles if you go back to the
[02:48:30.040 --> 02:48:35.360]  crash of 87 and the bond market crash of 94 and the dot-com crash of 2000 and the
[02:48:35.360 --> 02:48:41.680]  subprime crash of 2007 so here we are 2016 and we're having a crash it could
[02:48:41.680 --> 02:48:46.080]  be a basically a China crash let's call it at the at this time so this is right
[02:48:46.080 --> 02:48:50.640]  on schedule you know I said this crash was coming a couple years ago but the
[02:48:50.640 --> 02:48:55.680]  I didn't anticipate that the European Central Bank which is bad the history of
[02:48:55.680 --> 02:48:59.880]  being a prudent bank would open up its balance sheet and take in 10 to 15
[02:48:59.880 --> 02:49:03.680]  trillion dollars there's like an arms race there's an arms race of debt right
[02:49:03.680 --> 02:49:07.360]  now and obviously if the elites get first use of the money they're gonna keep
[02:49:07.360 --> 02:49:10.960]  saying it's okay but they're building armored redoubts for themselves
[02:49:10.960 --> 02:49:14.280]  everywhere now five years ago they wouldn't admit that now they do five
[02:49:14.280 --> 02:49:17.320]  years ago they wouldn't admit they really well what's the best performing
[02:49:17.320 --> 02:49:21.240]  currency of 2015 which happen would like to make again you're gonna tell us this
[02:49:21.240 --> 02:49:25.920]  Bitcoin it is Bitcoin and Bitcoin has been the best performing currency every
[02:49:25.920 --> 02:49:29.560]  year for the past since it since it came into existence and I've never been an
[02:49:29.560 --> 02:49:33.880]  enemy of it I never got involved in it because they'll claim it's crooked or
[02:49:33.880 --> 02:49:37.240]  something gonna arrest me so maybe I'm mad I never got involved in it but I've
[02:49:37.240 --> 02:49:42.040]  been a supporter of the idea that the basis of Bitcoin is I can sum it up in
[02:49:42.040 --> 02:49:47.640]  one word encryption you know encryption is well how George was value is the
[02:49:47.640 --> 02:49:52.480]  privacy yes and that's how George Washington won the Revolutionary War
[02:49:52.480 --> 02:49:55.880]  was through the secret messages and encryption that you know that that that
[02:49:55.880 --> 02:49:59.560]  that was a big part of it encryption is huge encryption protects our privacy
[02:49:59.560 --> 02:50:03.680]  here in the UK they want to pass what's called the snoopers charter which means
[02:50:03.680 --> 02:50:07.480]  that the government wants to kill encryption they don't want anything to
[02:50:07.480 --> 02:50:11.680]  be encrypted which will kill the internet it'll kill the internet it'll kill a lot
[02:50:11.680 --> 02:50:16.600]  of things but there is in my opinion those who support Bitcoin are fighting
[02:50:16.600 --> 02:50:19.720]  that fight they're fighting the fight against government no I totally agree
[02:50:19.720 --> 02:50:24.040]  with you I just don't like speculation but it is a people's speculation it's
[02:50:24.040 --> 02:50:27.160]  well forget the forget the speculation I'm not even saying you could never own
[02:50:27.160 --> 02:50:32.640]  a Bitcoin and still believe in the in the value I just don't want to make a
[02:50:32.640 --> 02:50:38.720]  recommendation and then have a lot but Max Max Max Bitcoin's got many years
[02:50:38.720 --> 02:50:43.000]  behind it now looks solid looks like it's emerged as the first true global
[02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:47.240]  independent currency of value and I think the fact that it's just keep
[02:50:47.240 --> 02:50:54.080]  surging shows how discredited the main line no bank I hear you it's
[02:50:54.080 --> 02:50:58.120]  revolutionary I've just reserved judgment but it looks better and better Max
[02:50:58.120 --> 02:51:01.800]  something just happened that is explained why survival food is
[02:51:01.800 --> 02:51:05.760]  literally flying off the shelves and has sold out in many areas of the country
[02:51:05.760 --> 02:51:11.280]  it caught me totally by surprise and it involves FEMA I can believe FEMA tried
[02:51:11.280 --> 02:51:15.680]  this until I saw proof revealing their secret could land me in hot water but I
[02:51:15.680 --> 02:51:20.400]  think you deserve to know exactly what they're doing watch the viral video at
[02:51:20.400 --> 02:51:25.720]  fema 3.com before it disappears again but be warned it's really disturbing

[02:53:04.680 --> 02:53:08.800]  disease. Something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in
[02:53:08.800 --> 02:53:12.960]  San Diego the old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying
[02:53:12.960 --> 02:53:17.200]  the young bucks and head-to-head fitness tests how is this even possible? Turns out
[02:53:17.200 --> 02:53:20.760]  the old guys in this unit had been part of a special test group for a doctor
[02:53:20.760 --> 02:53:24.920]  formulated fountain of youth drink called Patriot Power Greens. Patriot Power
[02:53:24.920 --> 02:53:28.280]  Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers that it's made their
[02:53:28.280 --> 02:53:32.400]  achy joints, stiff muscles and lack of energy a thing of the past. Previously
[02:53:32.400 --> 02:53:36.320]  this drink was only available to elite military units but for a limited time
[02:53:36.320 --> 02:53:40.280]  the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number of free

[02:55:23.480 --> 02:55:27.360]  discussing the call to impeach Obama the rash of rapes in Europe David Knight

[02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:38.400]  keep Obama in office let me ask you a question Max Kaiser you know we'll get
[02:55:38.400 --> 02:55:41.640]  back into Bitcoin the next segment if you do five more minutes the next hour I
[02:55:41.640 --> 02:55:45.480]  mean I was for impeachment of Bush I really am nonpartisan but they call me
[02:55:45.480 --> 02:55:48.560]  right wing as I'm pro-gun and like lower taxes I mean what idiot wouldn't when the
[02:55:48.560 --> 02:55:52.760]  major billionaire groups are basically tax exempt and lobbying to screw me out
[02:55:52.760 --> 02:55:55.640]  of my little bit of money and my staff had a little bit of money they keep I
[02:55:55.640 --> 02:56:00.600]  mean it's just ridiculous if people are informed but man Obama's got to be
[02:56:00.600 --> 02:56:04.760]  impeached on the open borders and flying refugees in and not even have an
[02:56:04.760 --> 02:56:08.600]  ID's and just turning them loose and coming out of the guns outside of law
[02:56:08.600 --> 02:56:13.760]  saying Congress has got to get in line so I can't wait for them to act I mean
[02:56:13.760 --> 02:56:18.640]  persecuting the media the IRS persecutions I mean I've never thought such
[02:56:18.640 --> 02:56:24.160]  precedents would be nakedly set and then I fear if they get some neocon like
[02:56:24.160 --> 02:56:29.440]  Jeb Bush in I mean it'll just get worse I mean this is sick what do you think's
[02:56:29.440 --> 02:56:35.640]  going on on that front and my big bush yeah well I'll ask you a question well
[02:56:35.640 --> 02:56:39.280]  that's the question I mean what do we do about Obama well let him continue to do
[02:56:39.280 --> 02:56:44.840]  this but obviously the past week was highlighted by the big guns beach so
[02:56:44.840 --> 02:56:49.000]  that that's definitely in the news so let me let me ask you a question I know
[02:56:49.000 --> 02:56:54.440]  you follow the gun issue obviously it's a big issue and I am always looking at
[02:56:54.440 --> 02:57:00.480]  this issue myself and and so I want to ask you a question so what what what
[02:57:00.480 --> 02:57:03.200]  would happen and I haven't really thought through this I'm god I'm really
[02:57:03.200 --> 02:57:06.880]  genuinely curious what you would think of this idea you know what would be the
[02:57:06.880 --> 02:57:13.920]  situation if gun owners were required to buy insurance to go with that gun so
[02:57:13.920 --> 02:57:17.560]  when you buy a gun you need to buy insurance to go with that gun similar
[02:57:17.560 --> 02:57:23.800]  to the way when you drill learn to get a car you need car insurance so the
[02:57:23.800 --> 02:57:29.440]  damage that's done you know by accidents no etc the power to tax is the power to
[02:57:29.440 --> 02:57:33.700]  destroy they're using Obamacare to take over the economy as a private tax
[02:57:33.700 --> 02:57:38.680]  corporations next it'll be a tax for a baseball bat or a or a or insurance for
[02:57:38.680 --> 02:57:43.800]  a night but it's but insurance is not a tax it's a it's a way to rule this to
[02:57:43.800 --> 02:57:51.840]  spread the cost of this no the cost is twelve thousand two hundred people
[02:57:51.840 --> 02:57:56.000]  dead a year on average max and about seven plus thousand commit suicide which
[02:57:56.000 --> 02:57:59.240]  is their right to do I don't support people killing themselves but I get it
[02:57:59.240 --> 02:58:02.520]  you got bone cancer or something blow your head off I mean I see it but I mean
[02:58:02.520 --> 02:58:06.560]  like the case that the folks to the government is coming down and if I read
[02:58:06.560 --> 02:58:09.680]  Obama they want to disarm us to enslave us brother and her brother they're gonna
[02:58:09.680 --> 02:58:13.240]  put they're gonna put fingerprint sensors on the guns right yeah that'll
[02:58:13.240 --> 02:58:17.000]  bankrupt all the old ones and and and make all the others illegal if this is a
[02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:21.400]  plan to get the right okay so I have the mayor pro team of Austin but at the
[02:58:21.400 --> 02:58:26.520]  Bloomberg admitting after they register they confiscate max okay but after
[02:58:26.520 --> 02:58:32.640]  there's no debate they want our guns but if it wouldn't it be in the interest of
[02:58:32.640 --> 02:58:37.440]  those supporting the gun lobby no no no compromising no no gun laws none let
[02:58:37.440 --> 02:58:40.600]  felons have guns let everybody have them because criminals are gonna have them
[02:58:40.600 --> 02:58:50.960]  anyways zero gun laws zero zero zero zero zero zero it has happened 2015 has
[02:58:50.960 --> 02:58:58.120]  passed into history in the law but now 2016 has been born and the decision lies
[02:58:58.120 --> 02:59:04.920]  in your hands to forge the destiny whoa whoa whoa that's a little too epic that

[03:00:16.960 --> 03:00:20.960]  like him too much to continue going down the road of guns so we'll get into the
[03:00:20.960 --> 03:00:24.840]  Bitcoin stuff and his announcement Bitcoin capital three Bitcoin fund
[03:00:24.840 --> 03:00:30.280]  managed by Simon Dixon and Max Keiser that pays daily dividends and Bitcoin so
[03:00:30.280 --> 03:00:33.000]  we'll talk some about other revolutionary things that are happening in the last
[03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:37.560]  five minutes we have left here but max I understand I mean I think you grew up in
[03:00:37.560 --> 03:00:40.480]  a big city in New York all that I mean maybe I'm wrong Connecticut whatever it
[03:00:40.480 --> 03:00:45.120]  was I forget it's almost like pod people like you grew up on Mars versus people
[03:00:45.120 --> 03:00:49.920]  that grew up I get it you know that Texas accents we actually have vestigial
[03:00:49.920 --> 03:00:57.600]  tails or whatever but we're a violent country forged out of war and conquest we
[03:00:57.600 --> 03:01:01.680]  have guns to protect ourselves as part of the culture 12,000 people down a year
[03:01:01.680 --> 03:01:06.560]  only a few thousand are innocence I mean I mean prescription drugs kill
[03:01:06.560 --> 03:01:09.720]  hundreds of thousands pleasantly bacteria hundreds of thousands and it's not
[03:01:09.720 --> 03:01:14.720]  this hysterical issue they take each death and turn into a tragedy waving a
[03:01:14.720 --> 03:01:20.800]  bloody shirt to try to get our guns so that's where I stand okay but it might
[03:01:20.800 --> 03:01:24.120]  I'm just saying over the past couple of days there's been you know it's been in
[03:01:24.120 --> 03:01:28.520]  the news quite a bit I have not heard anyone mention this the question of
[03:01:28.520 --> 03:01:32.480]  insurance so I'm asking you about it just because I'm curious I don't really
[03:01:32.480 --> 03:01:37.080]  am not advocating it I'm just saying I'm curious please don't give horrible ideas
[03:01:37.080 --> 03:01:41.920]  they've actually closed down it's okay no no please don't give them a
[03:01:41.920 --> 03:01:46.000]  devastating plan to destroy us but I mean please please you're like talking
[03:01:46.000 --> 03:01:52.960]  to me tonight put it away forget it we didn't see that you're something else
[03:01:52.960 --> 03:01:56.560]  hey sweetheart tell me about Bitcoin and you're one of the great captains of it
[03:01:56.560 --> 03:02:00.840]  now been a great captain since day one you're probably the inventor of it I'm
[03:02:00.840 --> 03:02:04.360]  joking and then I mean where's it all going to tell me about what you're
[03:02:04.360 --> 03:02:09.200]  doing oh well Bitcoin capital as you point out they mean it's a great way
[03:02:09.200 --> 03:02:13.480]  for people to get involved in Bitcoin so it pays a daily Bitcoin dividend I
[03:02:13.480 --> 03:02:17.080]  think actually if you live in the United States it might be difficult to
[03:02:17.080 --> 03:02:21.760]  participate because the US government is taking a pretty adversarial position
[03:02:21.760 --> 03:02:26.520]  against Bitcoin because if they see us competition but they should be aware of
[03:02:26.520 --> 03:02:32.200]  this product this fund and they should look into it and so I mentioned here we
[03:02:32.200 --> 03:02:38.000]  raised almost three million dollars for this and we used part of the money to
[03:02:38.000 --> 03:02:42.240]  invest in new Bitcoin startup companies that are doing you know
[03:02:42.240 --> 03:02:47.280]  entrepreneurs who are creating companies headed guy wearing a Santa Claus suit on
[03:02:47.280 --> 03:02:55.000]  your website that's Simon Dixon and he is he co-founded the fund with me and he
[03:02:55.000 --> 03:02:59.920]  is he and I went to the very first Bitcoin conference in 2000 one of the
[03:02:59.920 --> 03:03:04.480]  very first conferences in 2011 sure Bitcoin the price was three dollars a
[03:03:04.480 --> 03:03:09.720]  share he has an equity crowdfunding cycle back to the teacher that is a great
[03:03:09.720 --> 03:03:13.720]  success and so we are we exchanged notes we said you know what why don't we just
[03:03:13.720 --> 03:03:18.240]  create a fund like this we can use the mining output to pay people daily
[03:03:18.240 --> 03:03:22.400]  dividends the people who are in Bitcoin capital one for example they've already
[03:03:22.400 --> 03:03:26.960]  gotten half of what they invested back in dividend so sure and I wasn't bashing
[03:03:26.960 --> 03:03:31.480]  him and actually know who he is I kind of like that that that that sports jacket
[03:03:31.480 --> 03:03:35.200]  but I guess he is kind of like Santa Claus handing out the goodies what
[03:03:35.200 --> 03:03:38.760]  about the charge that Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme I'm not saying that but
[03:03:38.760 --> 03:03:41.480]  explain to me I mean because the government's got something even worse
[03:03:41.480 --> 03:03:46.600]  policy scheme well a big policy scheme my definition is like social security or
[03:03:46.600 --> 03:03:51.520]  Bernie Mainoff yes where they it's ever expanding hanging on more than is coming
[03:03:51.520 --> 03:03:57.520]  in yeah where Bitcoin is by definition an anti Ponzi scheme there's a set number
[03:03:57.520 --> 03:04:02.160]  of coins that's there are no more ever to be created it's it's capped at 21
[03:04:02.160 --> 03:04:06.840]  million so it's the Apple is the absolute opposite of Ponzi scheme so
[03:04:06.840 --> 03:04:10.480]  that's not even a valid that's a non-starter I mean there are things you
[03:04:10.480 --> 03:04:15.440]  could be critical of it like if the power grid goes down in the world how do
[03:04:15.440 --> 03:04:22.240]  I'm just being devil's advocate I'm actually glad that Bitcoin's done so
[03:04:22.240 --> 03:04:26.920]  well so many of my listeners have had like totally become happy about taking
[03:04:26.920 --> 03:04:33.840]  offense at your question I'm happy to answer three times three times Max I
[03:04:33.840 --> 03:04:38.560]  that people buy me dinner because they're listeners that got into Bitcoin
[03:04:38.560 --> 03:04:42.320]  because of the show and because of you three times people bought me dinner and
[03:04:42.320 --> 03:04:46.200]  we're like trying to like buy me cowboy boots one time because it happens to me
[03:04:46.200 --> 03:04:50.240]  everywhere I go people come up to me said it's the exact same story thank you
[03:04:50.240 --> 03:04:55.800]  Max I made an incredible amount of money with this and it's a little talk to you
[03:04:55.800 --> 03:05:01.120]  sir congratulations your lordship while president Obama attempts to enact gun
[03:05:01.120 --> 03:05:05.600]  control via executive action a new Gallup poll shows that only two percent of
[03:05:05.600 --> 03:05:10.200]  Americans believe that guns or gun control are among the country's top
[03:05:10.200 --> 03:05:15.320]  problems Gallup asked about 1,000 Americans in all 50 states what they
[03:05:15.320 --> 03:05:20.040]  thought the nation's top problems were in 2015 and out of 23 problems mentioned
[03:05:20.040 --> 03:05:25.920]  by Americans guns gun control ranked near the bottom at 19th in comparison
[03:05:25.920 --> 03:05:29.680]  16% of Americans said that the government was the nation's biggest
[03:05:29.680 --> 03:05:35.400]  issue 13% said the economy 8% said unemployment and another age said
[03:05:35.400 --> 03:05:40.180]  immigration but rather than working on these hot button issues both president
[03:05:40.180 --> 03:05:44.760]  Obama and the mainstream media would rather focus on gun control with a
[03:05:44.760 --> 03:05:49.000]  president even stating that he wants to quote make gun control part of his

[03:08:36.560 --> 03:08:40.360]  hour and a half ago saying Anthony is gonna be unable to do it so we need you
[03:08:40.360 --> 03:08:44.880]  to sit in of course it's my pleasure the big story I think which needs to be the
[03:08:44.880 --> 03:08:48.880]  big story all over the country especially as we get closer to January
[03:08:48.880 --> 03:08:53.480]  13th is this article that we put out on January 5th and I'm gonna go over some
[03:08:53.480 --> 03:08:57.480]  of these articles of impeachment they list 48 in this resolution written by
[03:08:57.480 --> 03:09:01.320]  drafted by the North American Law Center but here's the article report RNC
[03:09:01.320 --> 03:09:05.320]  will consider Obama impeachment proceedings and they meet back on
[03:09:05.320 --> 03:09:11.200]  January 13th so we need to really build that momentum to call for the
[03:09:11.200 --> 03:09:15.320]  impeachment of Obama and get people like Paul Ryan to call for it because we've
[03:09:15.320 --> 03:09:20.960]  seen what he's done in the past just by allowing he's kind of just he's put in
[03:09:20.960 --> 03:09:25.000]  by Boehner essentially installed and he's just go along to get along not
[03:09:25.000 --> 03:09:29.600]  really seeing any any sort of pushback from him but you could actually go to
[03:09:29.600 --> 03:09:33.480]  this article and they and from Scrib they have the articles of impeachment
[03:09:33.480 --> 03:09:39.760]  right there article one the first ten deal with his use of your sub your
[03:09:39.760 --> 03:09:43.560]  participation of the Oval Office via criminal identity fraud it goes over
[03:09:43.560 --> 03:09:50.640]  ten instances that they feel he was using identity fraud stuff we covered
[03:09:50.640 --> 03:09:56.200]  way back in the day with his birth certificate article two malfeasance
[03:09:56.200 --> 03:10:02.640]  misconduct and abuse of the Oval Office the first one talks about the IRS how
[03:10:02.640 --> 03:10:06.360]  he went using using the IRS to go after his political enemies and we've seen
[03:10:06.360 --> 03:10:10.280]  plenty of instances of that we've had the IRS head lowest learner in there
[03:10:10.280 --> 03:10:15.600]  looking at what and they were bringing her up and asking how she was going after
[03:10:15.600 --> 03:10:18.960]  certain groups and not letting them get tax ID numbers while letting other
[03:10:18.960 --> 03:10:23.640]  groups come right in but if you had Tea Party are conservative in your language
[03:10:23.640 --> 03:10:28.200]  you were at the back of the bus essentially number two is using the
[03:10:28.200 --> 03:10:31.400]  Federal Bureau of Investigation Secret Service National Security Agency and
[03:10:31.400 --> 03:10:35.800]  the Department of Homeland Security to and to disregard the constitutional
[03:10:35.800 --> 03:10:38.920]  rights of citizens by directing or authorizing such agencies to conduct
[03:10:38.920 --> 03:10:42.760]  or continue electronic surveillance and other investigations for the purposes of
[03:10:42.760 --> 03:10:46.880]  national security basically bypassing the Constitution and due process to spy
[03:10:46.880 --> 03:10:52.600]  on people number six misusing military force without congressional
[03:10:52.600 --> 03:10:58.440]  authorization and violation of the War Powers Act number eight unlawfully
[03:10:58.440 --> 03:11:01.440]  incarcerating members of the US military for carrying out orders on the
[03:11:01.440 --> 03:11:04.040]  battlefield without congressional authority or oversight creating
[03:11:04.040 --> 03:11:09.160]  increasing moral issues within the ranks number nine he's been derelict in his
[03:11:09.160 --> 03:11:12.560]  command and national security agencies resulting in the unnecessary deaths of
[03:11:12.560 --> 03:11:18.120]  American civilians in Benghazi and soldiers as well there's a big movie
[03:11:18.120 --> 03:11:22.160]  coming out about that he you know I really authorized the killing of American
[03:11:22.160 --> 03:11:26.280]  citizens deemed by political affiliation alone to be potential domestic
[03:11:26.280 --> 03:11:33.720]  terrorists you also use drones to kill a 16 year old boy at one point who was not
[03:11:33.720 --> 03:11:38.440]  considered a threat but he was just targeted because his dad was somebody
[03:11:38.440 --> 03:11:44.040]  who used to work with the Pentagon and so a lucky I apologize if I'm coughing a
[03:11:44.040 --> 03:11:48.360]  little bit I am slowly getting over a cold and I will tell you later how I
[03:11:48.360 --> 03:11:53.520]  did that not missing a day of work without you know just being able to
[03:11:53.520 --> 03:11:57.680]  maintain myself but I'll get into that later let's go back into article three
[03:11:57.680 --> 03:12:01.760]  aiding and abetting known enemies of the United States he's on that's number
[03:12:01.760 --> 03:12:06.400]  two is unlawfully used taxpayer funds to aid and abet an illegal invasion of the
[03:12:06.400 --> 03:12:10.400]  United States that's basically leaving the border wide open trucking in
[03:12:10.400 --> 03:12:15.800]  illegals letting them fly all around the country without using ID while we have
[03:12:15.800 --> 03:12:21.240]  10-year-old girls who are patted down 10-year-old because of a juice box number
[03:12:21.240 --> 03:12:25.840]  10 he's engaged in unlawful overt effort to disarm American citizens and remove
[03:12:25.840 --> 03:12:29.360]  public access to ammunition in direct violation of the US Second Amendment
[03:12:29.360 --> 03:12:34.120]  remember that ammo scare when ammo prices started going up and it had
[03:12:34.120 --> 03:12:37.280]  Homeland Security buying hundreds and millions and billions of rounds of
[03:12:37.280 --> 03:12:40.880]  ammunition and we kept telling people look at it they're buying lots of this
[03:12:40.880 --> 03:12:43.280]  ammunition and they say it's hollow point and they say it's for training
[03:12:43.280 --> 03:12:47.600]  purposes nobody trains with hollow point ammunition total lie he's worked on
[03:12:47.600 --> 03:12:51.120]  lawfully fund protect and defend known anti-American organizations indirect
[03:12:51.120 --> 03:12:57.880]  violation of US of 50 of the US code 843 and they list all the codes there's 48
[03:12:57.880 --> 03:13:03.080]  criminal charges in all even if he was only guilty of four it would be enough
[03:13:03.080 --> 03:13:06.240]  to impeach him so that's why you need to get this article report RNC will
[03:13:06.240 --> 03:13:09.640]  consider Obama impeachment proceedings out to everybody you know get him to
[03:13:09.640 --> 03:13:13.800]  read all these articles where I think we're gonna do a video breakdown of each
[03:13:13.800 --> 03:13:18.840]  one and talk about all the instances that where he has broken the law and show
[03:13:18.840 --> 03:13:22.560]  you how it happened because it's not just this year it's not the year before it
[03:13:22.560 --> 03:13:26.600]  goes all the way back to when he first got into office the IRS scandal started
[03:13:26.600 --> 03:13:30.920]  right then and even back in 2013 I just want to pull this article up this is
[03:13:30.920 --> 03:13:35.840]  from the past of August 2019 13 a hundred reasons to impeach Barack Obama
[03:13:35.840 --> 03:13:40.200]  and that's from a know the lies.com we list a few in there and then you can go
[03:13:40.200 --> 03:13:45.760]  to the article to see the rest now one of the reasons in there was about his
[03:13:45.760 --> 03:13:51.440]  illegal gun grabs and he is started the new year off of the bang literally going
[03:13:51.440 --> 03:13:57.680]  after our guns he started his executive actions with the crocodile tears to make
[03:13:57.680 --> 03:14:03.320]  everybody feel bad we showed you Coco the gorilla he's crying too he's falling
[03:14:03.320 --> 03:14:07.160]  in line with Barack Obama he's sad about guns guns are bad and says the gorilla
[03:14:07.160 --> 03:14:10.560]  so we have to ban them but let's see here's what Trump had to say this is
[03:14:10.560 --> 03:14:14.600]  Trump rails against Obama's executive action and here's what he had to say
[03:14:14.600 --> 03:14:18.240]  about what Obama's doing they're not gonna take your guns away folks they're
[03:14:18.240 --> 03:14:23.440]  not gonna take your guns they're trying they're talking about the bullets they're
[03:14:23.440 --> 03:14:33.080]  talking about and then as you see President Obama is on television who can
[03:14:33.080 --> 03:14:38.120]  blame you no no honestly after what we've gone through for years who can
[03:14:38.120 --> 03:14:41.920]  blame you for that I mean who can blame you but you saw what he did today
[03:14:41.920 --> 03:14:46.400]  executive orders he wants to do wouldn't it be nice if they could actually get
[03:14:46.400 --> 03:14:51.520]  Congress together and you know do it the old-fashioned way where people work and
[03:14:51.520 --> 03:14:55.360]  they this and they cajole and they have drinks together and they get along or
[03:14:55.360 --> 03:14:58.800]  they don't get along and they come up with something just wants to sign
[03:14:58.800 --> 03:15:03.440]  executive orders all the time no good it's no good it's no good I'd like to see
[03:15:03.440 --> 03:15:06.600]  Congress get together and they're not gonna screw around with I'd like to see
[03:15:06.600 --> 03:15:10.560]  Congress get together and and just do nothing for a couple years we have
[03:15:10.560 --> 03:15:13.520]  plenty of laws on the books let's just let's see what happens with the laws
[03:15:13.520 --> 03:15:18.040]  that we have instead of creating new laws and new regulations and new agencies
[03:15:18.040 --> 03:15:21.520]  to go out and harass the American citizens while we're trying to produce
[03:15:21.520 --> 03:15:25.480]  while we're trying to make a living and just being hammered hammered time and
[03:15:25.480 --> 03:15:29.280]  time again of course here's what Hillary Clinton had to say she's going to
[03:15:29.280 --> 03:15:32.840]  praise it oh yeah we need to go after the gun she's so afraid that's why she
[03:15:32.840 --> 03:15:35.720]  has so many bodyguards with guns protecting her at all times here she is
[03:15:35.720 --> 03:15:44.320]  I was so touched by the president if any of you saw it on TV I was very proud that he made these
[03:15:44.320 --> 03:15:50.320]  recommendations some of which I have been advocating in this campaign for we
[03:15:50.320 --> 03:15:55.440]  lose 90 people a day to gun violence homicides suicides terrible tragic
[03:15:55.440 --> 03:16:02.040]  avoidable accidents we can do better and we can do it in a constitutional way we
[03:16:02.040 --> 03:16:06.680]  can respect the rights of gun owners in fact comprehensive background checks
[03:16:06.680 --> 03:16:10.840]  closing the gun show loophole in the online loophole ending the immunity from
[03:16:10.840 --> 03:16:16.160]  liability for gun makers and sellers prohibiting people who are on the no
[03:16:16.160 --> 03:16:20.240]  fly list from buying guns oh yeah that would be something we could all agree
[03:16:20.240 --> 03:16:24.320]  right the no fly list that you have no idea how you get on it you have no idea
[03:16:24.320 --> 03:16:27.560]  how to get off of it they won't tell you why you're on it it's just an
[03:16:27.560 --> 03:16:32.400]  arbitrary list we've had congressman on this list and she wants to say we're
[03:16:32.400 --> 03:16:36.120]  just going to go buy the no fly list that is just that's a blatant violation
[03:16:36.120 --> 03:16:41.560]  of at least half the Bill of Rights right there now coming out of Sun News up
[03:16:41.560 --> 03:16:47.720]  in Canada this is Brian Lilly and he has a story of a man who defended himself
[03:16:47.720 --> 03:16:50.640]  it's a longer clip we're not going to play the whole thing it's about four
[03:16:50.640 --> 03:16:56.160]  minutes long and he talks about how confiscation well first you have
[03:16:56.160 --> 03:17:01.480]  registration always leads to confiscation and I'm just gonna let you
[03:17:01.480 --> 03:17:04.480]  say let it let you hear it from him and his words as he's got a show called
[03:17:04.480 --> 03:17:08.720]  byline and this is Brian Lilly I've got a warning to my American friends
[03:17:08.720 --> 03:17:13.440]  registration will lead to confiscation and if you don't believe me just look
[03:17:13.440 --> 03:17:16.560]  at what's happened here now are they going towards registration in the United
[03:17:16.560 --> 03:17:20.160]  States according to the Washington Post the Obama administration is
[03:17:20.160 --> 03:17:25.720]  considering a national database of all firearms in the US to quote track the
[03:17:25.720 --> 03:17:31.200]  movements and sale of weapons unquote if such a database comes to fruition it
[03:17:31.200 --> 03:17:36.400]  will lead to confiscation last year we ended our national long-gun registry
[03:17:36.400 --> 03:17:39.640]  here in Canada was a national database of every rifle and shotgun in the
[03:17:39.640 --> 03:17:44.160]  country that was supposed to help police well track the movement and sale of
[03:17:44.160 --> 03:17:48.240]  weapons now when it was introduced 20 years ago critics said how old on hold
[03:17:48.240 --> 03:17:52.920]  on we register the firearms they're going to be confiscated and that
[03:17:52.920 --> 03:17:56.960]  criticism was just dismissed it was really ridiculed yet that's what was
[03:17:56.960 --> 03:18:01.400]  happening right up until the long-gun registry was dismantled as recently as
[03:18:01.400 --> 03:18:05.920]  last winter at law-abiding gun owners who had complied with the registry were
[03:18:05.920 --> 03:18:10.880]  having their rifles confiscated in late 2011 hundreds if not thousands of
[03:18:10.880 --> 03:18:16.240]  people who had legally purchased the Army Jagger AP-80 a 22 caliber variant of
[03:18:16.240 --> 03:18:21.300]  the AK-47 were informed that their rifles had been deemed illegal and must
[03:18:21.300 --> 03:18:26.360]  be surrendered the latter read you are required by law to return your firearm
[03:18:26.360 --> 03:18:30.600]  registration certificates without delay either by mail to the address shown in
[03:18:30.600 --> 03:18:34.560]  the top left corner of this page or in person to a peace officer or firearms
[03:18:34.560 --> 03:18:39.800]  officers you have 30 days to deliver your firearm to a peace officer firearms
[03:18:39.800 --> 03:18:44.640]  officer or chief firearms officer or to otherwise lawfully dispose of them that
[03:18:44.640 --> 03:18:48.360]  was sent out by the Canadian Firearms Center the reason for the need to
[03:18:48.360 --> 03:18:53.200]  surrender what had been legal firearms was simply cosmetic the AP-80 look too
[03:18:53.200 --> 03:18:57.600]  similar exactly a 47 they want to create any reason they can to go after and
[03:18:57.600 --> 03:19:04.240]  that's a weapon that fires 22 caliber bullets really small and they're gonna
[03:19:04.240 --> 03:19:07.880]  call that an assault rifle because it looks like one will they design that as
[03:19:07.880 --> 03:19:12.160]  marketing but here we have in California this came out December 31st
[03:19:12.160 --> 03:19:16.600]  California gun confiscation law takes effect January 1st this is already going
[03:19:16.600 --> 03:19:21.160]  on right now this is from my ABC 7 a new California law takes effect January 1st
[03:19:21.160 --> 03:19:24.920]  it allows legally owned guns to be confiscated if family or friends believe
[03:19:24.920 --> 03:19:29.280]  the owner is a threat to themselves or others and there's and there it is
[03:19:29.280 --> 03:19:33.800]  believe right there so you have to have is a neighbor that's kind of angry at
[03:19:33.800 --> 03:19:38.960]  you anybody oh I think he's a threat he has guns and then boom they swoop in

[03:24:46.040 --> 03:24:50.200]  go hey the only answer is more police state now we've had open carry here in
[03:24:50.200 --> 03:24:54.280]  Texas just started January 1st Leanne McAdoo is out on the street to see what
[03:24:54.280 --> 03:24:57.880]  people thought about it here it is Leanne McAdoo for info wars calm I'm
[03:24:57.880 --> 03:25:02.040]  here in Austin Texas now we are four days into the official passing of open
[03:25:02.040 --> 03:25:05.400]  carry wanted to see what people's opinion are of now they're gonna be
[03:25:05.400 --> 03:25:10.440]  actually able to view people's guns in their holster are they afraid of that
[03:25:10.440 --> 03:25:13.520]  are they okay with that and we also wanted to get people's take on what's
[03:25:13.520 --> 03:25:17.040]  happening in Oregon do they think this is a good move or is this going to
[03:25:17.040 --> 03:25:21.840]  bolster Obama's push for gun control well we just passed open carry here
[03:25:21.840 --> 03:25:27.880]  January 1st so people for it yeah I'm all against it really yes I was still
[03:25:27.880 --> 03:25:35.920]  married I am I am for gun regulations and open carry is weird I'm not gonna go
[03:25:35.920 --> 03:25:40.240]  to any business where I see people waltzing in there with their guns it's
[03:25:40.240 --> 03:25:45.840]  just it just turns me off what do you guys think about the open carry that
[03:25:45.840 --> 03:25:50.200]  just passed here in Austin we know from here sorry does that frighten you to
[03:25:50.200 --> 03:25:54.400]  think that people will have guns on their holster or is are you okay with it
[03:25:54.400 --> 03:25:59.920]  I'm okay with it as long as they're responsible I'm fine with it would you
[03:25:59.920 --> 03:26:05.200]  be frightened to see people with their guns on their holster I don't think so
[03:26:05.200 --> 03:26:10.480]  because it is Texas it probably in some some places I would and probably in some
[03:26:10.480 --> 03:26:16.000]  places I wouldn't it just depends on the setting yeah yeah I think if you're
[03:26:16.000 --> 03:26:20.240]  responsible it can be done well but if you're not and people aren't paying
[03:26:20.240 --> 03:26:28.800]  attention bad things happen I'm a fan what's your opinion on it the well I
[03:26:28.800 --> 03:26:32.000]  don't think everyone should be walking around with them but mainly when it's
[03:26:32.000 --> 03:26:35.840]  really hot and you want to carry and it's too hard to wear eight pounds of
[03:26:35.840 --> 03:26:39.800]  clothes when it's a hundred degrees out then it's nice to be able to well I'm
[03:26:39.800 --> 03:26:43.360]  all for second amendment I think people should have the right to do what they
[03:26:43.360 --> 03:26:49.280]  wish to do however like my wife said I think that you're it's better to have
[03:26:49.280 --> 03:26:54.520]  it concealed than to be shown but if somebody wants to have it shown that's
[03:26:54.520 --> 03:26:58.760]  up to them but if you're allowed to have a gun it's kind of hard to not be
[03:26:58.760 --> 03:27:03.400]  allowed to carry it that's how I feel about it it lets you know who has the
[03:27:03.400 --> 03:27:06.640]  weapon there's people walking around with them concealed anyways I think
[03:27:06.640 --> 03:27:11.600]  that's scarier would you continue to go to a business that allowed people to
[03:27:11.600 --> 03:27:19.280]  bring in their guns yeah I think I mean I think I would I wouldn't like boycott
[03:27:19.280 --> 03:27:22.880]  them if I was in a circumstance where I felt uncomfortable or something I leave
[03:27:22.880 --> 03:27:27.040]  but I wouldn't make a big point out of it she said she wants more regulations
[03:27:27.040 --> 03:27:31.920]  well people that are law-abiding citizens are now having more regulations
[03:27:31.920 --> 03:27:36.800]  placed upon them and criminals will in fact skirt the law anyway so to me it's
[03:27:36.800 --> 03:27:41.600]  ridiculous are you aware what's going on in Oregon right now yeah I am a little
[03:27:41.600 --> 03:27:45.200]  I'm aware but I haven't like read a lot of details about it the president is
[03:27:45.200 --> 03:27:49.560]  about to come out on Thursday calling for more you know gun control regulations
[03:27:49.560 --> 03:27:54.120]  do you think something like that is gonna cause the country to be in support
[03:27:54.120 --> 03:27:58.720]  of more gun control or or do you think that they're gonna be proud of
[03:27:58.720 --> 03:28:04.280]  Americans standing up I think whoever is already against and for gun control is
[03:28:04.280 --> 03:28:08.520]  just gonna sway them more either way I don't think it's gonna change anyone's
[03:28:08.520 --> 03:28:11.760]  mind I don't think it's gonna be bringing people together the people on
[03:28:11.760 --> 03:28:15.600]  people gonna interpret it how they see it they're gonna either be on the side
[03:28:15.600 --> 03:28:21.680]  that thinks oh man this is what needs to be done give a ninja take a mile and the
[03:28:21.680 --> 03:28:24.440]  other side is oh this is so typical there's a lot of people that feel like
[03:28:24.440 --> 03:28:29.720]  the federal government overreaches what word it's there for that's what they
[03:28:29.720 --> 03:28:35.760]  feel like up there obviously in a lot of cases that's what I feel like I haven't
[03:28:35.760 --> 03:28:41.520]  had a situation where I felt compelled to gather some fellow citizens and take
[03:28:41.520 --> 03:28:47.240]  over a building I'm also not a rancher that lost their livelihood because the
[03:28:47.240 --> 03:28:50.640]  federal government decided they were gonna take some land or stop letting
[03:28:50.640 --> 03:28:57.040]  someone use my land or stop letting me use land so I mean I definitely I get
[03:28:57.040 --> 03:29:00.680]  where they're coming from but I'm gonna have to read about it more for sure to
[03:29:00.680 --> 03:29:05.880]  decide whether I think they're going totally overboard or maybe they're
[03:29:05.880 --> 03:29:10.520]  just having the guts to do something that somebody's got to do I think things
[03:29:10.520 --> 03:29:16.440]  should be done legally and do I actually think that's gonna hinder it no I
[03:29:16.440 --> 03:29:20.760]  think Obama's gonna do what Obama wants to do he's in his lame duck term as
[03:29:20.760 --> 03:29:24.600]  president and he's just gonna try to flex whatever muscle he thinks he can do
[03:29:24.600 --> 03:29:30.320]  and try to get away with it he's going to do the right thing
[03:29:32.280 --> 03:29:37.680]  he's gonna do what he wants to do that was Leanne McAdoo on the street asking
[03:29:37.680 --> 03:29:40.800]  people what they thought about open carry I got the phone lines loaded coming
[03:29:40.800 --> 03:29:45.720]  up Angie Tim Kyle Brandon wants to talk about ATF harassing gun showgoers so

[03:36:33.520 --> 03:36:38.760]  September 1st 2011 when we kicked off the infowars nightly news and we've done
[03:36:38.760 --> 03:36:42.920]  a show every day including holidays since that time I think there might have
[03:36:42.920 --> 03:36:46.200]  been one day where we did a repeat because we had some technical difficulties
[03:36:46.200 --> 03:36:52.200]  back in like 2012-2013 and and I say that right now right now we're actually
[03:36:52.200 --> 03:36:56.440]  redesigning the original nightly news studio and I just went today and looked
[03:36:56.440 --> 03:37:00.320]  at how it's coming along it's gonna look amazing and it's really gonna
[03:37:00.320 --> 03:37:06.160]  complement our other big studio studio C the war room and we're gonna have to
[03:37:06.160 --> 03:37:08.400]  come up with a new name for that studio so well I think we're gonna be doing the
[03:37:08.400 --> 03:37:10.760]  fourth hour out of there coming up we'll probably still be doing the fourth
[03:37:10.760 --> 03:37:13.760]  hour out of here sometimes and we'll be doing the nightly news out of there too
[03:37:13.760 --> 03:37:18.280]  so it's really exciting this is a brand new year get involved get your prison

[03:37:38.240 --> 03:37:44.840]  three what's going on at the gun shows in your area. Last week I was in a gun
[03:37:44.840 --> 03:37:51.840]  show in Richmond and I noticed there were two guys in suits harassing people
[03:37:51.840 --> 03:37:56.960]  and one of my buddies who's a local cop he was saying be careful watch what you
[03:37:56.960 --> 03:37:59.960]  say to them they're federal agents they're over here harassing people and
[03:37:59.960 --> 03:38:04.320]  he was told to leave them alone even though they were harassing people and
[03:38:04.320 --> 03:38:08.200]  they were just asking people what are you doing here you buying guns for and
[03:38:08.200 --> 03:38:13.060]  I mean this is this is like something out of the twilight zone I mean what are

[03:40:03.800 --> 03:40:09.840]  some you know and and then some I mean he just the immigration situation years
[03:40:09.840 --> 03:40:13.800]  ago I lived over in Europe when they started and most people don't know
[03:40:13.800 --> 03:40:18.360]  this when it really started with the Turks coming in they would go down the
[03:40:18.360 --> 03:40:21.840]  streets my kids know Arabic and they would go down the streets and they would
[03:40:21.840 --> 03:40:25.640]  harass the Germans all the time they would spray paint things they would take
[03:40:25.640 --> 03:40:30.040]  our old bases and they would house immigrants in there it got really
[03:40:30.040 --> 03:40:33.120]  violent people couldn't use the bathroom because they were afraid of being beat
[03:40:33.120 --> 03:40:37.360]  up and that's the same thing's gonna happen in the United States if you
[03:40:37.360 --> 03:40:41.040]  don't think it really will. They're already talking about using bases here to
[03:40:41.040 --> 03:40:44.600]  house immigrants. I mean this is going we just had the
[03:40:44.600 --> 03:40:48.840]  Czech president right around Christmas time talking about why is it that we've
[03:40:48.840 --> 03:40:53.880]  got all of these young men almost exclusively as migrants who are saying
[03:40:53.880 --> 03:40:58.360]  they're the refugees he goes these are people who are able and capable to fight
[03:40:58.360 --> 03:41:01.960]  ISIS there they should be staying in that country in their country exactly it's
[03:41:01.960 --> 03:41:05.760]  he says if you got refugees okay I can understand if it was children people who
[03:41:05.760 --> 03:41:09.560]  were sick coming in but these are able-bodied men who should be fighting
[03:41:09.560 --> 03:41:13.200]  ISIS that that was really the case but of course what the reality is is that
[03:41:13.200 --> 03:41:18.080]  they are an army to fight but they're bringing them here to fight us. It's an
[03:41:18.080 --> 03:41:22.200]  invasion by stealth, a total invasion by stealth they should be back fixing their
[03:41:22.200 --> 03:41:25.240]  own country and our criminal government should stop doing things like
[03:41:25.240 --> 03:41:31.800]  funding ISIS and running drone attacks on regular people, wedding parties, farmers
[03:41:31.800 --> 03:41:37.600]  yeah you need to stop doing that too. No tears for that. Right exactly but you
[03:41:37.600 --> 03:41:39.920]  know those people need to go back and fix their own country but look at this
[03:41:39.920 --> 03:41:45.640]  they had 570,000 people sign a petition to legally force the UK government to
[03:41:45.640 --> 03:41:49.520]  block Donald Trump from entering the country. What if we had 570,000 people
[03:41:49.520 --> 03:41:54.680]  just you know go and sign a petition to impeach Obama. Let's put that up on
[03:41:54.680 --> 03:41:58.960]  their little whitehouse.gov list maybe they'll answer that they
[03:41:58.960 --> 03:42:01.080]  they say they'll answer it after a hundred thousand people sign it.
[03:42:01.080 --> 03:42:06.200]  Isn't it interesting that those 570,000 people probably are not concerned about
[03:42:06.200 --> 03:42:10.400]  the the way the ocean of Muslim migrants coming in I mean they probably
[03:42:10.400 --> 03:42:13.640]  support that is why they don't like Donald Trump that's amazing to me they
[03:42:13.640 --> 03:42:18.000]  think he's a danger to them but not millions of people who are coming here
[03:42:18.000 --> 03:42:22.920]  as a as a third column in their in the article he mentions that there's no go
[03:42:22.920 --> 03:42:27.560]  areas in the UK which we've confirmed yeah we could barely get Paul Watson and
[03:42:27.560 --> 03:42:30.520]  Joe Biggs to go into some of these areas because they're afraid to get an
[03:42:30.520 --> 03:42:36.040]  attack yeah this was in London guys put that examiner article back up there it
[03:42:36.040 --> 03:42:40.400]  is Obama is six military bases to house surge of illegal immigrants where's the
[03:42:40.400 --> 03:42:45.120]  surge coming from from the open border from the military and if they can't get
[03:42:45.120 --> 03:42:48.920]  here through the open border fly them in oh yeah exactly yeah and the border
[03:42:48.920 --> 03:42:52.640]  patrols being hamstrung so they can't really do their job I mean I remember
[03:42:52.640 --> 03:42:57.080]  when we were in El Paso film they just open up the gate and drive off all you
[03:42:57.080 --> 03:43:00.780]  to do is walk across the river it was about this thick you know wasn't that
[03:43:00.780 --> 03:43:03.720]  deep just walk across you can come right in and they don't put them at the border
[03:43:03.720 --> 03:43:09.800]  my wife just on Tuesday got stopped with a border patrol checkpoint well inside
[03:43:09.800 --> 03:43:13.800]  the country about 75 miles inside the country pretty much a station there
[03:43:13.800 --> 03:43:16.920]  wanting to know what do you what are you doing here you American citizen what
[03:43:16.920 --> 03:43:19.480]  do you do for a living it's none of their business just like this guy's talking
[03:43:19.480 --> 03:43:23.520]  about at the gun show absolutely none of their business yeah and that was
[03:43:23.520 --> 03:43:27.240]  Brandon Brandon send me that video please put it up on YouTube and send it to
[03:43:27.240 --> 03:43:31.360]  us we'll get you a bunch of views Angie thanks for calling let's go to Tim in
[03:43:31.360 --> 03:43:39.200]  Wyoming hello hey Tim hi hi thanks for taking my call gentlemen you were
[03:43:39.200 --> 03:43:43.280]  talking earlier about I'll be talking about gun shows and gun grabbing right
[03:43:43.280 --> 03:43:48.560]  now but I want to bring I want to bring back the the subject of the Oregon the
[03:43:48.560 --> 03:43:53.640]  Oregon ranchers and the situation up there not that it's out of out of out of
[03:43:53.640 --> 03:43:59.080]  mind at all but what I wanted to bring up was the fact that there's the the law
[03:43:59.080 --> 03:44:04.840]  of the sea treaty which I think has been has been signed by our government by
[03:44:04.840 --> 03:44:09.160]  or by someone in our government and we're actually under the law of the sea
[03:44:09.160 --> 03:44:14.600]  treaty which means that any riparian area any water flow area any lake any
[03:44:14.600 --> 03:44:21.080]  stream any I mean the ocean even any water at all anywhere is under the
[03:44:21.080 --> 03:44:26.720]  control of the United Nations and so when the when the VOM is taking land
[03:44:26.720 --> 03:44:34.800]  from farmers and ranchers and whoever else or to widen the borders around the
[03:44:34.800 --> 03:44:39.200]  river or around the stream or around a creek or whatever the water source
[03:44:39.200 --> 03:44:42.680]  happens to be they're actually following along with that because they're
[03:44:42.680 --> 03:44:46.560]  saying the water doesn't belong to you right or anyone else and they took which
[03:44:46.560 --> 03:44:50.560]  was a good idea which is hey nobody can own a river and they go well now the
[03:44:50.560 --> 03:44:53.080]  federal government owns the river and now we can tell you what to do because it
[03:44:53.080 --> 03:44:56.040]  used to be you could walk along a high watermark line even if it was on
[03:44:56.040 --> 03:44:59.000]  somebody's private property you could walk through it and now they're just
[03:44:59.000 --> 03:45:02.520]  going no we own everything we own everything it is a total grab well
[03:45:02.520 --> 03:45:06.480]  there's a the congressman from that area in Oregon his name is Greg Walden
[03:45:06.480 --> 03:45:10.280]  he had a very impassioned speech and there's a link to the article on Drudge
[03:45:10.280 --> 03:45:15.880]  the next sagebrush revolution very passionate speech he's known that
[03:45:15.880 --> 03:45:20.560]  family for decades he said he worked with them to try to get along with the
[03:45:20.560 --> 03:45:24.320]  BLM with their plans and of course they came up with regulations of BLM just
[03:45:24.320 --> 03:45:27.560]  said no we're not going to do that we're just going to shut that down and he
[03:45:27.560 --> 03:45:31.040]  doesn't realize I think when he's talking about this he says you know they
[03:45:31.040 --> 03:45:33.800]  have these meetings where they get us together we all agree on what we're
[03:45:33.800 --> 03:45:36.280]  going to do and they just go do something completely different that's
[03:45:36.280 --> 03:45:39.840]  agenda 21 that's been going on for a long time and of course they have
[03:45:39.840 --> 03:45:44.440]  finalized more details and aspects of that put a time limit on it with agenda
[03:45:44.440 --> 03:45:48.600]  2030 that they passed just in this last September people have to understand that
[03:45:48.600 --> 03:45:52.760]  there is a very clear agenda that is being pursued by the federal government
[03:45:52.760 --> 03:45:58.040]  it's a globalist agenda the agenda is to get people off of the land okay it's
[03:45:58.040 --> 03:46:01.800]  not just that there is bad management it's not just that it's an arrogant
[03:46:01.800 --> 03:46:06.440]  bureaucracy all of that is true but it is far worse than that this is an
[03:46:06.440 --> 03:46:11.000]  agenda just like the war on drugs was a UN agenda people conservatives need to
[03:46:11.000 --> 03:46:16.640]  understand this too because the the war on drugs was laid out verbatim as a UN
[03:46:16.640 --> 03:46:21.360]  agenda in 1961 10 years before Richard Nixon declared the war on drugs in 1971
[03:46:21.360 --> 03:46:25.840]  and followed their schedules one two four verbatim even the drugs that they
[03:46:25.840 --> 03:46:29.080]  put on there that's why it's an international scheduling situation all
[03:46:29.080 --> 03:46:32.800]  the countries around the world use those same four schedules it all came
[03:46:32.800 --> 03:46:35.240]  for the United Nations they're doing the same if you fight it they're gonna
[03:46:35.240 --> 03:46:38.800]  hammer you economically yeah exactly and so you know that they come up with
[03:46:38.800 --> 03:46:41.960]  this and then they leave it to the individual countries to implement it
[03:46:41.960 --> 03:46:46.040]  and to execute and everything but it's all being driven with these agendas from
[03:46:46.040 --> 03:46:48.600]  the United Nations and they have an agenda for how they're going to get
[03:46:48.600 --> 03:46:52.840]  people off of the land force you into the cities control your transportation
[03:46:52.840 --> 03:46:56.640]  control your communication monitor everything and now let's use firewood
[03:46:56.640 --> 03:47:00.000]  to keep warm in the winter that's right you know we talked about the EPA last
[03:47:00.000 --> 03:47:04.720]  year going after people who had smoke coming out of their chimneys they're
[03:47:04.720 --> 03:47:08.080]  creating a situation it's like the sheriff of Nottingham and Sherwood
[03:47:08.080 --> 03:47:11.640]  Forest you guys go in there that's the Kingsland right you're not entitled to
[03:47:11.640 --> 03:47:14.440]  take a twig out of there or we'll execute you I mean that's what we're
[03:47:14.440 --> 03:47:18.880]  headed for and that and going in and grabbing old wood it's what helps it
[03:47:18.880 --> 03:47:22.000]  was it's what keeps wildfires down but they don't want that they want wildfires
[03:47:22.000 --> 03:47:27.800]  they love it let me tell you Rob my uncle was a forestry professor at University
[03:47:27.800 --> 03:47:31.840]  Missouri many many years okay he's head of the department he was outraged before
[03:47:31.840 --> 03:47:35.080]  he died at what the federal government was doing allowing dead wood to lie on
[03:47:35.080 --> 03:47:38.000]  the ground we saw it with the massive fires and bass drop we've seen it many
[03:47:38.000 --> 03:47:41.560]  places I saw it when we went out to Yellowstone in 2002 it was still not
[03:47:41.560 --> 03:47:45.640]  recovered from the decades earlier we were driving along with the windows down
[03:47:45.640 --> 03:47:48.960]  enjoying the the smell of the pine air and then all of a sudden boom
[03:47:48.960 --> 03:47:53.040]  desolation as soon as we cross into federal lands because they don't manage
[03:47:53.040 --> 03:47:56.680]  the property and they do things because they said oh we want to worship the way
[03:47:56.680 --> 03:48:00.640]  the natural earth would be and everything no it's just mismanagement if you let weeds
[03:48:00.640 --> 03:48:04.600]  grow up into your garden into your farm you're not gonna have any food and if
[03:48:04.600 --> 03:48:08.840]  they let the trees lay down that's why they haven't so many wildfires and as
[03:48:08.840 --> 03:48:12.040]  this don't let you do anything yes as this congressman was pointing out that's
[03:48:12.040 --> 03:48:15.840]  a way of life out there because a federal government mismanagement and they
[03:48:15.840 --> 03:48:20.040]  had 200,000 acres that were burning when they set that backfire that burned
[03:48:20.040 --> 03:48:23.960]  139 acres those 200,000 acres that were burning that was because of
[03:48:23.960 --> 03:48:27.560]  mismanagement by the BLM and they've done deliberate things to private property
[03:48:27.560 --> 03:48:31.120]  they never answered for they never even compensated people for but they send
[03:48:31.120 --> 03:48:35.200]  these people to jail for five years calling them arsonists and terrorists
[03:48:35.200 --> 03:48:37.840]  absolutely outrageous doing the same thing that the federal government does
[03:48:37.840 --> 03:48:41.520]  almost every day yeah and what what needs to happen is the states need to come
[03:48:41.520 --> 03:48:44.480]  together and start kicking the federal government out and reclaiming their land
[03:48:44.480 --> 03:48:48.720]  yes that's your state land yes and instead of going letting these outside
[03:48:48.720 --> 03:48:52.640]  bureaucracies these people who have no training in forestry or anything they
[03:48:52.640 --> 03:48:55.040]  just have they have their books that they've learned these guys have never
[03:48:55.040 --> 03:48:57.200]  gotten their hands dirty and they're running around telling people how to
[03:48:57.200 --> 03:49:00.920]  live their lives is totally atrocious yeah thanks for the call Tim let's go to
[03:49:00.920 --> 03:49:04.520]  one more call and then we'll finish up here with Paul Ryan if we have time I
[03:49:04.520 --> 03:49:09.040]  think we're running out he's not on the phone though hey Kyle you want to talk
[03:49:09.040 --> 03:49:17.480]  about open carry go ahead Kyle are you there yeah yeah I'm here hey well you
[03:49:17.480 --> 03:49:21.520]  know from my perspective I live down here in Houston area it seems like as
[03:49:21.520 --> 03:49:28.240]  soon as this open carry began it seems like the fear just just came out of the
[03:49:28.240 --> 03:49:34.520]  woodworks just you know I see so many people who you know they may be gun
[03:49:34.520 --> 03:49:39.640]  supporters it is the basics of their life but you know when it comes when the
[03:49:39.640 --> 03:49:43.960]  rubber meets the road and I can give you an example you know I'm involved in my
[03:49:43.960 --> 03:49:48.840]  church really actively and a lot of my family is in their churches and just
[03:49:48.840 --> 03:49:52.360]  recently you know all the churches are having to vote on are they going to
[03:49:52.360 --> 03:49:58.640]  allow open carry in their church service and as a member of the staff at my
[03:49:58.640 --> 03:50:03.120]  church you know that is that is fiction to come up to vote and things like that
[03:50:03.120 --> 03:50:07.960]  you know you have to think about and can I jump in here and tell you
[03:50:07.960 --> 03:50:13.400]  something go to our site and search five bullets to save a thousand people I
[03:50:13.400 --> 03:50:17.160]  think it was the interview that I had with Charles Von Vic and he was a South
[03:50:17.160 --> 03:50:21.480]  African guy he just happened to be in a church a thousand people they knew it was
[03:50:21.480 --> 03:50:25.400]  a liberal church that nobody there would be armed and there was a gang of people
[03:50:25.400 --> 03:50:30.520]  this is back when they had in South Africa they had the resurrection
[03:50:30.520 --> 03:50:34.640]  the insurrection that was going on there and they came in spraying people with
[03:50:34.640 --> 03:50:39.040]  automatic weapons and throwing bombs and this guy saved that congregate with a
[03:50:39.040 --> 03:50:42.440]  handgun with a handgun yeah exactly that's why we need guns because when
[03:50:42.440 --> 03:50:46.760]  bad people do things we need good people to stand up are you gonna stand up this
[03:50:46.760 --> 03:50:49.440]  is the fourth hour of overdrive I'm Rob do your host sitting in with David Knight

[03:54:14.760 --> 03:54:18.960]  David Knight and tonight I just talked to Lea McAdoo she's popped her head and
[03:54:18.960 --> 03:54:22.640]  she's gonna be talking about the raping that's going on in Europe especially in
[03:54:22.640 --> 03:54:27.080]  Germany well one of these groups are called Dusseldorf is watching they have a
[03:54:27.080 --> 03:54:30.760]  big Facebook group and they're gonna provide protection at major events in
[03:54:30.760 --> 03:54:33.800]  city center so they're starting to fight back they'll probably be condemned as
[03:54:33.800 --> 03:54:37.800]  criminals and racist and hateful they'll be bad because they don't want their
[03:54:37.800 --> 03:54:41.280]  women getting raped they'll make right wingers yeah exactly look at these
[03:54:41.280 --> 03:54:46.480]  extremists don't want the women to be raped while their country dies and
[03:54:46.480 --> 03:54:49.400]  everything else now we're gonna get to Paul Ryan in the last segment we didn't
[03:54:49.400 --> 03:54:53.800]  really get into get into him but David what is the bottom line with Paul Ryan
[03:54:53.800 --> 03:54:57.080]  like they've been in instituted this guy pushed him on us we got rid of Boehner
[03:54:57.080 --> 03:55:00.560]  and now we got basically Boehner's little brother well he's been open
[03:55:00.560 --> 03:55:03.440]  borders for a very long time but of course when we look at this funny bill
[03:55:03.440 --> 03:55:07.680]  remember it was just three weeks ago that they pushed through the omnibus bill I
[03:55:07.680 --> 03:55:11.080]  call the omnibust bill because it funds everything in the world it's gonna make
[03:55:11.080 --> 03:55:16.840]  us go bust even more debt yeah and you know it started out as I told you Rob
[03:55:16.840 --> 03:55:20.480]  you know we started out that segment the bottom of the hour with the song from
[03:55:20.480 --> 03:55:23.760]  the birds you know to everything there is a season turn turn you know well
[03:55:23.760 --> 03:55:26.880]  there's a time to spend and a time to pretend he's already spent the money
[03:55:26.880 --> 03:55:30.560]  now he's coming back and saying well I want to pretend that we're gonna shut
[03:55:30.560 --> 03:55:33.520]  down Planned Parenthood I want to pretend that we're gonna shut down Obamacare
[03:55:33.520 --> 03:55:38.080]  what he did with Obamacare for example is they gave Harry Reid and the
[03:55:38.080 --> 03:55:42.720]  Democrats precisely what they wanted and that was a delay on the Cadillac tax
[03:55:42.720 --> 03:55:47.320]  now the Cadillac tax says that you've got a really good health insurance program
[03:55:47.320 --> 03:55:51.440]  which the unions have negotiated of course the that they were going to tax
[03:55:51.440 --> 03:55:54.440]  that at a very high rate so they've pushed this off two three years in the
[03:55:54.440 --> 03:55:59.440]  future now okay to make Obamacare more palatable to make half the country who's
[03:55:59.440 --> 03:56:04.560]  under these plans go we like Obamacare yeah exactly to ease the pain to make
[03:56:04.560 --> 03:56:09.000]  it more acceptable then he comes back to the Republican base and he says hey you
[03:56:09.000 --> 03:56:13.840]  know we didn't fund Obamacare because we didn't raise taxes enough so if we get
[03:56:13.840 --> 03:56:18.440]  rid of it now we can save even more money this guy ought to be an offense to
[03:56:18.440 --> 03:56:22.080]  people who are Republicans and Democrats people who support these programs
[03:56:22.080 --> 03:56:26.720]  and people who oppose these programs because he is so incredibly cynical he's
[03:56:26.720 --> 03:56:31.400]  such a liar and of course we saw that the Republicans are saying hey we're
[03:56:31.400 --> 03:56:34.920]  gonna have something to say about this Paris climate pact we're gonna you know
[03:56:34.920 --> 03:56:40.840]  we're gonna not fund that within less than a week they had funded the climate
[03:56:40.840 --> 03:56:43.880]  initiative exactly passed in Paris so this is the way these guys roll and on
[03:56:43.880 --> 03:56:47.400]  top of that he wants to send your children to go fight ISIS a group that
[03:56:47.400 --> 03:56:51.200]  we funded there's a article from Kurt Nemo house leader Paul Ryan hawks neocon
[03:56:51.200 --> 03:56:55.920]  version of war on the Islamic State so on top of spending all your money he
[03:56:55.920 --> 03:57:01.320]  wants to kill your children I want to go to Kylo in California who's got 2016
[03:57:01.320 --> 03:57:07.560]  ideas Kylo you got about a minute 20 what are your ideas for 2016
[03:57:07.560 --> 03:57:13.280]  hi Rob Dave great to talk to you guys honor I had one for you just for a
[03:57:13.280 --> 03:57:17.640]  segment for the show the way the news is coming at us so quickly and stuff just
[03:57:17.640 --> 03:57:21.960]  falls through the cracks I mean now it's always says that you know it just keeps
[03:57:21.960 --> 03:57:25.920]  getting bigger and bigger but a segment called due justice where you could
[03:57:25.920 --> 03:57:29.000]  actually pull something back that happened in the last week and give it
[03:57:29.000 --> 03:57:35.000]  like a proper you know investigation something that we might have missed yeah
[03:57:35.000 --> 03:57:38.560]  because we just get so inundated and I know you guys do that and it's kind of
[03:57:38.560 --> 03:57:41.760]  just a clever pun but it's just you know it really does feel that there's so much
[03:57:41.760 --> 03:57:45.240]  news coming out there there's just not enough time to cover it all oh yeah it
[03:57:45.240 --> 03:57:49.880]  really feels like I mean we do five hours a day yeah and I can't we can't
[03:57:49.880 --> 03:57:55.640]  barely cover it all I agree Kylo go ahead Kylo go ahead oh yeah other than
[03:57:55.640 --> 03:58:01.120]  that I was just gonna say just with the the star I just a little nervous there
[03:58:01.120 --> 03:58:06.080]  but for someone I made a resolution this year to get more involved and do more
[03:58:06.080 --> 03:58:09.960]  investigative reporting to start my own thing do you guys have like just the
[03:58:09.960 --> 03:58:15.080]  suggestion like as far as equipment or like minimal stuff that to make it a
[03:58:15.080 --> 03:58:19.480]  decent quality you can do it all with an iPhone now or any kind of smartphone
[03:58:19.480 --> 03:58:23.520]  you can buy little things to make your audio a little bit better but you can
[03:58:23.520 --> 03:58:26.400]  just start with an iPhone and get and put it up in people's faces and talk to
[03:58:26.400 --> 03:58:29.880]  them just start talking to people put it on YouTube you could take action out
[03:58:29.880 --> 03:58:32.880]  there so do that we'll join we'll see here tomorrow and tonight 7 o'clock
[03:58:32.880 --> 03:58:36.280]  central with the Info Wars Nightly News thanks for watching and if you are
