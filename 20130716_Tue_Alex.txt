[00:33.000 --> 00:43.760]  all right ladies and gentlemen we're live and it is Tuesday the 16th day of July 2013 I've
[00:43.760 --> 00:49.680]  wanted to get her on for a very long time we're gonna cover the waterfront with Mary Lou
[00:49.680 --> 00:56.480]  Hinner of course movie star TV star first in taxi because I heard her on a Howard Stern
[00:56.480 --> 01:02.120]  interview a few years ago listening on XM where she has one of the most photographic memories
[01:02.120 --> 01:12.200]  ever recorded and it is a genetic trait that's been documented it's it's really super human
[01:12.200 --> 01:21.400]  highly superior autobiographical memory or H. Sam then has a longer name a scientific name
[01:21.400 --> 01:27.760]  hyper thigh Semenia am I pronouncing that wrong the point is is that she's gonna be coming on
[01:27.760 --> 01:34.640]  with us via video Skype in the second hour today for a little bit lighter topics but it's still
[01:34.640 --> 01:39.360]  gonna be very very informative very very interesting lady we'll talk about parenting
[01:39.360 --> 01:44.800]  relationships we'll ask about her incredible memory and talk about what it's like having that
[01:44.800 --> 01:49.440]  because I have a really good memory but no I mean not not not one-tenth what this lady has
[01:49.440 --> 01:54.880]  and she's not doing a radio show here on the GCN radio network as well the same network
[01:54.880 --> 01:58.880]  as syndicate to my broadcast and her health journey for her and her husband and she looks
[01:58.880 --> 02:04.400]  so young I saw her on TV a few months ago and it's just unbelievable so that she's gonna be
[02:04.400 --> 02:09.520]  joining us Mary Lou Hinner I've wanted to get her on since I heard that Howard Stern interview
[02:09.520 --> 02:17.560]  a few years ago and so what's going to happen here today John Bowne had the idea to get Ted
[02:17.560 --> 02:22.640]  Nugent on today because he's got an article saying Nugent Zimmerman verdict vindicate
[02:22.640 --> 02:28.640]  citizen patrol self-defense so I texted Ted right before the show to see if he wanted to come on
[02:29.920 --> 02:36.480]  and so we are trying to schedule him right now he may be on in the third hour or he may be on
[02:36.480 --> 02:42.560]  tomorrow the next day after that so that's happening might have Ted Nugent and to get his
[02:42.560 --> 02:51.360]  take on everything coming up here today that said I am really disgusted by the whole Trayvon
[02:51.360 --> 02:58.880]  Martin situation because I'm sad this young man's dead anybody who's a parent sees those parents up
[02:58.880 --> 03:05.280]  there and grieving and you have empathy and I'm disgusted by people celebrating his death
[03:06.000 --> 03:11.600]  because I have been seeing some of that and I'm disgusted by people reacting just the same back
[03:12.240 --> 03:18.240]  in racial hatred saying that they're going to go out and kill white people and it's now starting
[03:18.240 --> 03:24.240]  where whites are being beat up all over the country I mean I've got a stack of news from
[03:24.240 --> 03:32.960]  Florida to Michigan from New York to California from New Jersey to Washington State there are
[03:32.960 --> 03:41.760]  racial attacks happening on on on on whites and Hispanics I mean can you imagine let's say
[03:41.760 --> 03:48.240]  if a black person killed my wife and even if they did it for racial reasons just what I randomly
[03:48.240 --> 03:52.960]  go find a black person and beat him up or shoot him and it's just crazy it's crazy
[03:55.280 --> 04:02.320]  I mean I couldn't imagine storming a Walmart and beating and roughing up white people in there
[04:04.640 --> 04:09.120]  just because they're white like they're walking around going yeah I'm glad Trayvon Martins
[04:09.120 --> 04:13.520]  did and then I see the other side of it the white supremacist people
[04:14.560 --> 04:17.840]  they're all over every website out there and I went and looked it up some of the big white
[04:17.840 --> 04:22.880]  supremacists sites are organizing this trolling but then we've also looked at some of the
[04:24.480 --> 04:28.400]  groups doing it it's also other people stirring stuff up that are playing the part of multiple
[04:28.400 --> 04:34.720]  posters probably even government really trying to create division this is a scyop any way you
[04:34.720 --> 04:40.960]  slice it and we're going to be going over all of that meanwhile Russian bombers are basically
[04:40.960 --> 04:49.120]  buzzing Japan US troops are massing all over the Middle East just incredible stuff's going on
[04:49.680 --> 04:54.560]  and we're all busy at each other's throats it's why the globalists are in control folks
[04:54.560 --> 04:59.200]  they know how to divide and conquer and I'm so sick of watching everybody being suckered

[09:01.520 --> 09:09.120]  staff sergeant joseph biggs is going to be joining us i talked to him quite a bit yesterday
[09:09.120 --> 09:13.760]  and he's talked to some investigative journalist and some other sources and obviously he's also
[09:13.760 --> 09:19.600]  talking to the family and the investigative journalists have told him that indeed the police
[09:20.400 --> 09:30.080]  were at his house that day that's the dead reporter the the associate editor investigative
[09:30.080 --> 09:37.440]  journalist michael hastings and that one of the groups that was reportedly questioning
[09:37.440 --> 09:44.640]  some of the friends and family was a special division of homeland security called homeland
[09:44.640 --> 09:52.880]  security investigations uh i am going to fly one of my reporters or camera people whoever
[09:52.880 --> 10:00.560]  wants to go a lot of them want to go uh with sergeant biggs he's in a charlotte over in the
[10:00.560 --> 10:06.320]  carolinas we're going to fly him out to california next week and i'm going to fly one of my reporters
[10:06.320 --> 10:12.320]  out there with him uh to go around and talk to some of the eyewitnesses and who we're already in
[10:12.320 --> 10:17.600]  contact with and to go and to speak to uh some of the other investigative journalists that have
[10:17.600 --> 10:25.600]  actually been threatened uh for investigating what's going on with michael hastings show pray
[10:25.600 --> 10:30.560]  for us ladies and gentlemen because they killed him we don't know if it was this group of homeland
[10:30.560 --> 10:37.360]  security people we just uh are on their trail in the investigation just because a federal group
[10:38.800 --> 10:43.120]  investigated something obviously someone who's getting ready to leak a bunch of
[10:43.120 --> 10:48.800]  criminal government activity doesn't mean they're the ones that did it but regardless if they are
[10:48.800 --> 10:55.280]  reportedly threatening other reporters uh that uh we're in contact with and that's staff sergeant
[10:55.280 --> 11:03.440]  biggs has spoken to uh at length then this is definitely a hot potato and all the rest of
[11:03.440 --> 11:08.000]  media are just like we're not going to look at what happened we're not going to look at breitbart
[11:08.000 --> 11:12.800]  we're not going to look at vince foster we're not going to look at gary web we're not going to look
[11:12.800 --> 11:21.680]  at uh the coroner that did the autopsy on breitbart being poisoned to death uh by uh a uh well known
[11:21.680 --> 11:28.400]  poison arsenic we're all just going to look the other way and basically let criminal forces do
[11:28.400 --> 11:36.800]  whatever they want well i'm not going to go along with this and and it's not because i have courage
[11:38.240 --> 11:47.520]  i have a compulsion a good instinct head screwed on straight compulsion that most americans had in
[11:47.520 --> 11:52.640]  the past that if somebody saw something wrong going on or something stunk they would at least
[11:52.640 --> 11:58.720]  do some investigating because you understand that if they can murder michael hastings and then get
[11:58.720 --> 12:04.000]  away with it and not even have an investigation and clearly have a cover-up then they can kill
[12:04.000 --> 12:14.080]  anybody in the press and then we become mexico we become north korea we become sudan we become
[12:14.080 --> 12:21.760]  romania and we let criminal gangs and thugs rule and that's why the criminal government wants our
[12:21.760 --> 12:28.240]  guns while they are buying more guns and training for war with us and using our money to buy nuclear
[12:28.240 --> 12:34.000]  weapons and and and tanks and billions of bullets and doing all this because we've just turned the
[12:34.000 --> 12:42.560]  world over to the criminal control freaks that want to run things and uh you know i certainly hope
[12:42.560 --> 12:48.240]  if they blow my car up i certainly hope if they hang me uh that everyone doesn't just sit there
[12:48.240 --> 12:56.160]  incredibly cowardly and just go oh no nothing to see here let's all look the other way that cowardly
[12:57.760 --> 13:06.400]  pathetic craven attitude is what has led us to this point as a society and it's only going to get
[13:06.400 --> 13:14.480]  worse are there any men left yeah there are men like staff sergeant begs there's men like myself
[13:14.480 --> 13:19.040]  there's there's many women in my crew they're all yeah we're ready to go out there and it's not
[13:19.040 --> 13:23.680]  that dangerous to really go out to california to the interviews itself it's it's it's doing the
[13:23.680 --> 13:30.080]  investigation overall and this platform they don't like because other than this broadcast
[13:30.080 --> 13:40.960]  there's almost no one covering it there are citizens out there putting reefs and flags
[13:40.960 --> 13:46.640]  and notes saying they know they killed mr hastings and by the way the engines shot the
[13:46.640 --> 13:49.920]  opposite direction out of the car the witnesses said they saw it blow up in the middle of the
[13:49.920 --> 13:53.920]  street and come to rest up against the tree he said they're coming after me i'm going off the
[13:53.920 --> 14:00.480]  radar i'm going into hiding uh the the feds are visiting friends and family uh they're probably
[14:00.480 --> 14:11.280]  going to raid my news offices this is the biggest story of my life cia it'd be like if i got up on
[14:11.280 --> 14:16.000]  air instead i'm going into hiding there after me i've got to break this story for my safety
[14:16.640 --> 14:21.520]  the feds are visiting everybody i basically know you know don't talk to them if they show up
[14:21.520 --> 14:28.160]  i'll talk to you soon and then boom your car blows up i mean that's not even two plus two
[14:28.160 --> 14:35.600]  equals four that's not even one plus one equals two that's just one looking at the number one
[14:36.400 --> 14:40.880]  the numeral one and saying what is that to a three-year-old they go it's a one
[14:43.360 --> 14:49.280]  it's like walking outside and going there's the sun there's a bird there's a tree uh they're coming
[14:49.280 --> 14:57.520]  after me i'm going into hiding make a story ever boom everybody loves cheesy star wars analogies
[14:57.520 --> 15:03.680]  i'll give you one again maybe we can pull it up and play it uh where at the hoth attack uh the
[15:03.680 --> 15:07.520]  imperial walkers have blown out the generator the stormtroopers are going to the base and
[15:07.520 --> 15:11.040]  you hear the guy going imperial troops have entered the base imperial troops have entered the base
[15:11.040 --> 15:18.640]  they'd be like oh no that's a conspiracy theory stormtroopers didn't kill that radio operator
[15:19.280 --> 15:22.800]  no no he just said imperial troops have entered the base imperial troops have entered the base
[15:24.880 --> 15:29.200]  pretty obvious what happened there i mean with bigs it's more obvious
[15:31.040 --> 15:35.040]  with all the things that he's seen and all the things that he knows and the people he's now
[15:35.040 --> 15:41.200]  talking to he's in the middle of it but how obvious is it to us what happened to michael hastings
[15:43.040 --> 15:47.600]  as some people say hey man we know they killed him let's move on folks we all hang together
[15:47.600 --> 15:53.280]  or we hang separate and and this basic human instinct of standing up for people that gave
[15:53.280 --> 15:58.080]  their lives i mean a week before he's killed he goes on the young turks and says they're
[15:58.080 --> 16:02.240]  harassing the media they're waging war on us it's time to stop working with the national
[16:02.240 --> 16:08.320]  security system it's destroying america it's time to release national security data and then this
[16:08.320 --> 16:16.160]  homeland security investigations a division of ice they're the ones over the drugs supposedly stopping
[16:16.160 --> 16:20.080]  the drugs coming in that means telling them which group to stop which group to let in
[16:21.120 --> 16:26.720]  they're over national security data protecting that they operate in 50 plus countries this is
[16:26.720 --> 16:33.120]  the group this is the praetorian guard and he's talked to reporters he's coming up sergeant bigs
[16:34.880 --> 16:39.200]  that when you investigate these people you get raided they come they threaten you they say
[16:39.200 --> 16:44.160]  according to this reporter he's talking to they told her you're going to be six feet under if you
[16:44.160 --> 16:51.280]  don't stop investigating us and and they're the guys that have the black armored ice vehicles when
[16:51.280 --> 17:00.640]  you see those in your town the black tanks they're the winners they're the gods they're the kings
[17:00.640 --> 17:05.920]  they're the north korean army basically they're the el hefe
[17:08.800 --> 17:12.400]  and there's lots of other groups and there's and there's cia hit teams and they've got
[17:12.400 --> 17:17.680]  hit teams inside the fbi counterterrorism wing and that's really the group that carries out
[17:17.680 --> 17:22.880]  most the terror attacks or or at least provocateurs them and you know it's not fun to sit here and
[17:22.880 --> 17:30.880]  know all this and talk about all this but i'm not going to sit here and just watch all this go on
[17:31.520 --> 17:37.200]  i expect if they kill me or some group kills me i expect you to not drop it
[17:38.880 --> 17:43.600]  i expect people to cover it because let me tell you something folks they can't get us all and by
[17:43.600 --> 17:49.600]  the way people aren't just going to sit here forever and watch everybody get killed so it's
[17:49.600 --> 17:57.680]  very important that it be on record who in the federal government are prime suspects in all of
[17:57.680 --> 18:09.520]  this prime suspects in tyranny it's very important and of course that's the way it worked in the
[18:09.520 --> 18:14.400]  soviet union the way it worked in nazi germany malice china the internal federal groups that are
[18:14.400 --> 18:21.520]  over the feds like the q group in the nsa the the the ss that goes out and persecutes and things
[18:22.720 --> 18:30.080]  they've always got the you know former military former contractor guys the guys that pile out
[18:30.080 --> 18:35.520]  of these black tanks and and and again they're the tough guys why they're allowed to do whatever
[18:35.520 --> 18:43.520]  they want they have the ndaa that obama signed where he says because he's emperor he's kim jong
[18:43.520 --> 18:50.880]  ill he's kim jong on he's hitler he's stalling he's mal he's linen he's lfa he's the king rat

[18:55.920 --> 19:01.360]  saying obama will sign death orders on any citizen he wants and i guess we're all supposed to roll
[19:01.360 --> 19:07.440]  over like a dog that's scared and and urinate all over ourselves that's what a dog does i guess as
[19:07.440 --> 19:12.720]  an american i'm supposed to wrap myself in a flag roll over whenever i see somebody in a black

[24:05.200 --> 24:11.840]  and the heart of the resistance you're listening to the alex jones show you know i've already said
[24:11.840 --> 24:17.200]  a lot of my peace on the latest developments with michael hastings will cover that for about
[24:17.200 --> 24:21.520]  10 minutes with staff sergeant begs the next segment then i'm going to get into
[24:21.520 --> 24:28.640]  the fact that the hate crimes they're all all crimes are hateful of their against someone's
[24:28.640 --> 24:34.960]  person physically and it takes a hatred of your own humanity to preemptively attack somebody just
[24:34.960 --> 24:45.200]  out of viciousness but there are reports of kidnappings beatings shootings murders pouring
[24:45.200 --> 24:52.240]  in right now and the media is very politically correct they're apologizing when they're reporting
[24:52.240 --> 24:59.760]  on it or outright not covering it jogger kidnapped and attacked over zimmerman verdict that's up on
[24:59.760 --> 25:05.920]  info wars dot com it's only on local news brothers murdered over free zimmerman sticker
[25:06.880 --> 25:11.200]  probably not too smart to have a sticker like that but it's their first amendment
[25:11.200 --> 25:18.400]  uh again the of the extreme weighing in on it certainly uh it's your first amendment but
[25:18.400 --> 25:23.120]  there are a lot of people that think that inherently being white is a reason to die
[25:23.840 --> 25:28.320]  and the media basically plays along with that in their division so brothers murdered over free
[25:28.320 --> 25:33.520]  zimmerman sticker jacksonville sheriff's office accused of covering up hate crime and this is the
[25:33.520 --> 25:38.640]  psi optic it's all fighting with each other uh it's really energizing the white supremacist
[25:38.640 --> 25:44.880]  and people and then they're putting out all this vitriolic insulting uh language and and calls for
[25:44.880 --> 25:53.120]  violence uh but don't generally actually carry it out and then you've got walmart's being ransacked
[25:53.120 --> 26:00.640]  and people being attacked for their race it is just unbelievable uh to see all of this unfolding
[26:02.000 --> 26:06.720]  trevon protesters as that's called it's it's protesting i guess the whoever killed these
[26:06.720 --> 26:13.920]  two brothers it was a protest i guess um that's what you call that now a trevon protesters storm
[26:13.920 --> 26:18.960]  walmart assault bystanders and i mean if somebody tries to drag me out of my car
[26:20.560 --> 26:26.480]  i'm going to start shooting people that are assaulting me and i just don't i guess it's
[26:26.480 --> 26:30.880]  it's all happening like california oakland places where the average you know trendy
[26:30.880 --> 26:37.840]  um does it isn't armed or or even don't even fight back with their fist i mean you can say what
[26:37.840 --> 26:42.080]  you want about conservatives they've got their problems but liberals on average will go into
[26:42.080 --> 26:49.200]  catatonic states um if they're white liberals i i i guess it means if you're a white liberal that
[26:49.200 --> 26:54.320]  you're uh that you've been gel did i mean maybe they go through a some type of surgery and then
[26:54.320 --> 26:59.680]  they're selling t-shirts out in l.a saying wanted dead or alive george zimmerman you know if i sold
[26:59.680 --> 27:04.080]  t-shirts like that about somebody who'd been found not guilty of something that i mean the cops would
[27:04.080 --> 27:08.560]  show up here they'd say it's a terrific threat but again when the mother and brotherhood murders
[27:08.560 --> 27:13.840]  and kills people it's a protest when al-qaeda our government puts in libya or syria kills hundreds
[27:13.840 --> 27:20.480]  of thousands of people uh you know upwards 40 000 black people it's a love crime you know when
[27:20.480 --> 27:27.120]  obama drops bombs it's it's love bombs it's peace bombs it's connecticut uh kinetic military actions
[27:27.120 --> 27:34.160]  it's uh now a violent nonviolent as the white house uh carney said he is the white house carnaval
[27:34.160 --> 27:41.680]  barker so he is mr carney if the name fits then uh carnaval barker is a carnaval barker by any
[27:41.680 --> 27:46.240]  other name a rose is a rose by any other name so why not have it be carney if it is a carney
[27:46.640 --> 27:52.640]  a carnaval barker lying fraud and it's just getting crazier and crazier and i said last week i
[27:52.640 --> 27:57.040]  believe zerman would be acquitted because there was reasonable doubt i think what he did was probably
[27:57.040 --> 28:03.600]  stupid to go out there but he got all the witnesses he got the reasonable doubt uh that's why oj got
[28:03.600 --> 28:09.440]  off and i've said this a thousand times but people don't care it's too much fun to have the media tell
[28:09.440 --> 28:18.080]  them when to get upset when to go out mindlessly i wish people would go out and protest uh would
[28:18.080 --> 28:22.720]  their white instigators it seems to be in most cases stern everybody up uh for political power
[28:22.720 --> 28:28.160]  i wonder if they would go out and protest because of gmo's being forced from the food or kids being
[28:28.160 --> 28:33.120]  forced to take vaccines that are deadly or deadly fluoride in the water that that that's
[28:33.120 --> 28:44.000]  happening to all of us we're all being attacked by this we're all under the gun by this white people
[28:44.000 --> 28:49.200]  don't get a memo not to drink fluoride we don't get memos not to take the vaccines we don't get
[28:49.200 --> 28:53.520]  memos by the way i was reading last night was in the associated press i forgot to print it when you
[28:53.520 --> 28:59.280]  print this japan has now said don't take the garter cell shot they approved it a few years ago we
[28:59.280 --> 29:04.160]  approved it six years ago they approved it two years ago they had so many deaths and problems the
[29:04.160 --> 29:08.560]  japanese government has put out a recommendation saying don't take this now
[29:08.560 --> 29:14.080]  japan said 15 years ago don't give under two-year-olds vaccines it's brain damaging them at least
[29:14.080 --> 29:19.280]  japan cares a little bit about its people here it's on purpose oh but nobody's gonna get mad you
[29:19.280 --> 29:24.560]  go give your kid a shot they have a convulsion never talk again at age two nobody goes out in
[29:24.560 --> 29:30.800]  riots nobody goes out and you know does this nobody attacks big pharma no no no when the media
[29:30.800 --> 29:36.160]  said they don't want to take the vaccine they don't want to take the vaccine they don't want to
[29:36.160 --> 29:40.960]  no no no when the media says we all get at each other's throats and
[29:43.040 --> 29:48.080]  the media then helps cover up when black folks are actually killing white devils

[34:22.720 --> 34:29.520]  served in the 82nd Airborne in Iraq and Afghanistan and since 2008 has been friends with the now
[34:29.520 --> 34:35.840]  deceased rest in peace Michael Hastings and he's the person one of the people he contacted
[34:36.640 --> 34:40.560]  hours before his car blew up and the engine shot the opposite direction of the vehicle
[34:41.600 --> 34:46.000]  he contacted him and said i'm going off the radar i'm going into hiding the the feds are
[34:46.000 --> 34:56.160]  visiting friends and family the feds are probably going to raid my offices now don't talk to him
[34:56.160 --> 35:01.360]  until you've got a lawyer i'm going to break the biggest story ever cia boom
[35:04.560 --> 35:08.080]  i mean that's right out of a movie i'm going into hiding i've got the next story boom
[35:11.040 --> 35:14.880]  and then the witnesses say the car is driving down the street blows up and then comes to rest on
[35:14.880 --> 35:22.400]  a tree i've sent reporters there jeez you're netta and also know me prins went there and the tree's
[35:22.400 --> 35:28.160]  barely damaged i'm going to send reporters there next week and a bunch of the crew wants to go
[35:28.160 --> 35:34.480]  i may send one of our great cameraman josh out there i could probably send him maybe with
[35:34.480 --> 35:41.920]  gg as well send a whole team out there to talk to neighbors witnesses we're already in contact
[35:41.920 --> 35:46.960]  with these people and also draw attention to what's happening that there's video that gg shot
[35:46.960 --> 35:51.920]  shot uh just this weekend when she was in los angeles we've already had our reporters
[35:53.920 --> 36:02.080]  out there but we're going to do some in-depth investigations on this and staff sergeant
[36:02.080 --> 36:08.000]  biggs has talked to an investigative journalist and i know who the investigative journalist is
[36:08.000 --> 36:14.080]  who's still off record who was already investigating this group and was threatened to her face
[36:14.080 --> 36:21.280]  and i've had police officers on like don browning who had two different occasions of fbi coming in
[36:21.280 --> 36:27.600]  his office and saying you and your wife are dead you've heard him on this show if you continue to
[36:27.600 --> 36:32.480]  investigate oklahoma city he was one of the first responders along with tarence yakey they tortured
[36:32.480 --> 36:37.680]  tarence yakey cop of the year to death so this is not a game ladies and gentlemen and the people
[36:37.680 --> 36:42.560]  that were running the justice department then are running it now the people that ran fast and furious
[36:42.560 --> 36:51.360]  a false flag on the second amendment they're running this now and so if i die or if sergeant
[36:51.360 --> 37:00.240]  biggs gets killed we didn't commit suicide if my car blows up if i if they say i commit suicide it
[37:00.240 --> 37:09.760]  is a lie i love life so much i'm willing for them to kill me to defeat tarence that's the opposite
[37:09.760 --> 37:15.840]  of being suicidal that's loving life so much i'm willing to put my life on the line for others
[37:15.840 --> 37:23.520]  not because i'm a hero folks i have an instinct for life when everybody sells out you get north
[37:23.520 --> 37:32.160]  korea when everybody stands up you get moon bases you get life extension you get high technology
[37:32.160 --> 37:41.680]  you get prosperity stand up create a beautiful civilization of high art and culture lay down
[37:41.680 --> 37:48.480]  sewage runs through the streets like most mexico cities i am not going to bow to tyranny i'm not
[37:48.480 --> 37:56.080]  doing it and there's no doubt they killed michael hastings no doubt no doubt and i've talked to
[37:56.080 --> 38:00.880]  police detectives on and off record a bunch of they go obviously he was murdered obviously there's
[38:00.880 --> 38:06.880]  a cover-up how day one they said no foul play within hours i mean right there you know the
[38:06.880 --> 38:15.680]  fixes in folks when they say no foul play instantly the coroner of breitbart ladies and gentlemen
[38:15.680 --> 38:19.920]  was poisoned to death that's on record and they're not investigating that they say yeah he was
[38:19.920 --> 38:23.920]  poisoned to death probably murder we're not investigating because who do you think's doing
[38:23.920 --> 38:29.280]  the killing now now going to staff sergeant joe biggs to talk about some of this specifically
[38:29.280 --> 38:34.560]  he's got a list of things to go over we appreciate his time obviously today sir we're going to be
[38:34.560 --> 38:38.640]  getting on the phone with you we're working it out right now when when we're going to meet you out in
[38:38.640 --> 38:44.400]  la uh when is best uh but that'll all be done off air after the show today but we're doing it
[38:44.400 --> 38:50.720]  we're launching this operation uh to find the truth uh and of course the whole world's a stage
[38:50.720 --> 38:54.800]  each of us players upon us we need to create a name of the operation we need to get attention
[38:54.800 --> 39:00.480]  that's really why overall 50 50 50 percent's good attention the other 50s do research and
[39:00.480 --> 39:04.800]  investigate but now you've heard what i've had to say here introducing you one of the points
[39:04.800 --> 39:10.640]  that need to be made and the new developments and the group that you are uh in uh investigating
[39:10.640 --> 39:17.360]  that may be involved at the heart of this yeah i was contacted uh twice over the past week and
[39:17.360 --> 39:24.560]  a half by a reporter and um she was currently working on a story looking into what is called
[39:24.560 --> 39:31.120]  the homeland security investigations department it's a group of people that consist of about 6,300
[39:32.480 --> 39:40.080]  special agents that cover 43 cities or 23 cities and 43 different countries outside of the us
[39:40.800 --> 39:46.720]  they have free free reign of power all over the us and those 43 countries full immunity and do
[39:46.720 --> 39:52.720]  whatever they want they have higher authority over any other other department there is well
[39:52.720 --> 39:58.720]  she was investigating them and she had been warned from time to time she said and then it got to a
[39:58.720 --> 40:02.800]  point where she came home and her daughter was home alone and these guys are going through
[40:02.800 --> 40:06.800]  her house going through her computers or personal things her files trying to see what she was doing
[40:06.800 --> 40:12.400]  and she was told she didn't stop she'd be killed so she finally let the story go well michael
[40:12.400 --> 40:19.200]  hastings death happened and she started looking into that and come full circle now she's running
[40:19.200 --> 40:24.720]  in the same names of the people she was investigating a while back with the homeland security investigations
[40:24.720 --> 40:30.160]  department so i find that pretty interesting that this small tactical unit that works with
[40:30.880 --> 40:40.320]  drug cartels and terrorism things like that are uh having a part of his death well when i looked at
[40:40.320 --> 40:46.480]  the group i was already aware of them but they are the batarian guard they are the small nexus group
[40:46.480 --> 40:50.160]  over the money laundering the drug dealing all of it and those are the always the key groups
[40:50.960 --> 40:56.880]  that are telling the lower feds what they can and can't investigate and they also say their main
[40:56.880 --> 41:02.720]  mission is controlling sensitive national security info and by the way i want to get
[41:02.720 --> 41:06.640]  wane madson on about this i want to get his take on this right now let's see if he can pop in
[41:06.640 --> 41:10.320]  towards the end of the next hour on this it's so important because he's the guy that exposed the
[41:10.320 --> 41:16.800]  q group five years ago and since then it's been confirmed that it is the q group in nsa that
[41:16.800 --> 41:23.680]  goes around black bagging people in the government but this is the essence of a tyranny and again i
[41:23.680 --> 41:29.920]  don't want to say that we know that this is the group but they certainly fit the type of mo
[41:31.280 --> 41:38.480]  of the types of organizations that i've seen like take the fbi the anti-terrorism unit of the fbi
[41:38.480 --> 41:43.680]  that's the group that pops up killing cops that are exposing stuff killing journalists
[41:43.680 --> 41:48.800]  bombing buildings to blame it on political enemies so yes it's generally the highest level
[41:49.520 --> 41:55.520]  most classified groups within domestic operations that are generally over pulling triggers
[41:55.520 --> 42:02.880]  or they authorize and oversee private contractor hit teams yeah well i just got the an email too
[42:02.880 --> 42:09.200]  i have all the names and the original witnesses from the accident that say they heard an explosion
[42:09.200 --> 42:15.280]  now the funny thing is is everything we need to know is in that that nine one more or those
[42:15.280 --> 42:20.480]  multiple nine one one calls from these people um that's all being hidden from us and you know
[42:20.480 --> 42:24.400]  they're saying that they hear explosions well when explosion like that happens who do they call
[42:24.400 --> 42:30.000]  who should who should be there atf so why wasn't atf or why they're not saying that they were
[42:30.000 --> 42:37.120]  involved if there was an explosion you know so to say and again they're covering up the police
[42:37.120 --> 42:42.000]  report and have told the fire department and police that's on record local tv stations
[42:42.960 --> 42:48.160]  have reported that you need to hook up next week we need to brainstorm on this with the reporter
[42:48.160 --> 42:54.720]  out of san diego that had the courage to cover it we need we're already in contact with the family
[42:54.720 --> 43:00.160]  uh the wife of the guy uh where the uh you know he's got the water hose on it she thinks it was
[43:00.160 --> 43:05.440]  an bomb i think she's on the show tonight the nightly news and we're getting a whole lift
[43:06.000 --> 43:12.880]  and so um here we go and and again i'm just glad that my reporters have the courage to go out there
[43:12.880 --> 43:16.880]  my my listeners know that i don't usually go on the road a lot because i have to keep all this
[43:16.880 --> 43:22.960]  running here uh but i'm glad that my reporters want to go with you i'm glad you're going and
[43:22.960 --> 43:27.680]  i appreciate your courage uh but again i don't think there's really any danger while you're out
[43:27.680 --> 43:33.200]  there it's if you get any big info that's when you guys have to watch out but you can instantly
[43:34.080 --> 43:39.680]  video feed that i recommend we'll have some instant video feeds out there and other things
[43:39.680 --> 43:46.320]  in case anybody tries anything but i think what makes us safer is actually exposing this i think
[43:46.320 --> 43:51.600]  we're all in danger sergeant uh staff sergeant if we don't expose this what's your take on that
[43:51.600 --> 43:57.280]  well of course i already have the the name of the special agent in charge of the uh the ice
[43:57.840 --> 44:02.480]  unit that oversees the homeland security investigation department in la i have that
[44:02.480 --> 44:07.520]  reporter out of san diego's name and number and she's possibly gonna meet up with me during our
[44:07.520 --> 44:14.160]  time there so um we're going to be able to press some issues and open some eyes for sure well
[44:14.160 --> 44:18.320]  you're a good friend to mike what do you think mike would think if he was seeing all this right
[44:18.320 --> 44:23.600]  now well hopefully wouldn't be judging me too much on the fact that i'm not that good at what i'm
[44:23.600 --> 44:28.560]  doing but at least i'm trying to put an effort and learn how to do this as i go but i'm sure he'd
[44:28.560 --> 44:33.040]  be happy i mean uh sure but i mean what would he do if another investigative reporter had been
[44:33.040 --> 44:38.080]  killed like this i think i think he would be investigating it as well oh of course i mean
[44:38.080 --> 44:42.720]  that's just how he was i mean he he's not the one to just roll over on something like that and let
[44:42.720 --> 44:49.280]  it go he would be out here digging just as much as we are right now what about the family since
[44:49.280 --> 44:54.400]  you saw him at the funeral i guess they're you told me that she's got a different plan to work on
[44:54.400 --> 45:00.000]  this i i hope it's a good plan yeah she's gonna do her own thing i'm sure she doesn't really want
[45:00.000 --> 45:05.200]  to be out in the public eye so much right now um all of his close friends and uh that he grew up with
[45:05.200 --> 45:09.440]  and even some of the ones who were just the past five years they've all reached out to me and they've
[45:09.440 --> 45:14.320]  been helping me out immensely giving me you know different avenues of approach people i could talk to
[45:14.320 --> 45:19.840]  because he knew a lot of journalists a lot of military people as well so he's given me different
[45:19.840 --> 45:24.640]  contacts and ways that uh his friends have given me different contacts things like that that i could
[45:24.640 --> 45:29.760]  use to help us out so that's been very helpful and also your followers your your listeners have
[45:29.760 --> 45:33.760]  been very helpful too that have followed me on twitter and given me really good ideas and you
[45:33.760 --> 45:39.760]  know different perspectives that i can absolutely how do folks follow you on twitter um at Rambo
[45:39.760 --> 45:48.480]  Biggs r a m b o b i g g s at Rambo Biggs folks all of us helping and everybody should be
[45:48.480 --> 45:52.720]  investigating citizen reporters should be investigating but if you've hit something big
[45:53.280 --> 45:58.880]  you've got to release it instantly listeners do not hold on to it uh the you know journalists tend
[45:58.880 --> 46:04.480]  to do that to to really double check and polish things when you're doing something this dangerous
[46:04.480 --> 46:08.480]  you've got to just release everything as you get it because you don't know when you've gotten the
[46:08.480 --> 46:13.440]  piece of info that's going to send these people after you well the big thing too though is we're
[46:13.440 --> 46:16.160]  going to go to a lot of these places they're not going to know we're going to be there so then
[46:16.160 --> 46:20.320]  they're going to have time to prepare some kind of you know stupid story so we're going to go in
[46:20.320 --> 46:25.760]  there and just bam hit them with it and i want to see how they react right off the bat absolutely
[46:25.760 --> 46:31.280]  and in my experience telling people you're coming with these type of folks make some even behave
[46:32.080 --> 46:38.560]  worse sometimes which which will uh really bring them down i mean you know they're watching and
[46:38.560 --> 46:42.480]  listening right now uh staff sergeant you want to say anything to the folks out there that were
[46:42.480 --> 46:50.480]  involved in this hey i'll see you guys soon yeah i just hope all the veterans out there realize
[46:50.480 --> 46:56.800]  what's happening in this country uh joe yeah well i've had a lot of them reaching out to me too
[46:56.800 --> 47:02.240]  right now i mean you get some of those guys to join the military just to to get that you know
[47:02.240 --> 47:06.000]  education benefit and they don't really care what happens and you got some of the people that you
[47:06.000 --> 47:09.440]  know they get out there like myself and they see a lot of this dirty stuff that goes on and they
[47:09.440 --> 47:15.200]  really just disgust you at points in time to see how you know we're out there fighting for what we
[47:15.200 --> 47:20.160]  believe in and there's this whole artillery you know different mode of going on that's just kind of
[47:20.160 --> 47:25.040]  the saddening you know there's a lot of things that go on but still people have to remember
[47:25.040 --> 47:29.200]  there's a war going on regardless of the fact that you believe in it or not there's still Americans
[47:29.200 --> 47:32.480]  over there dying and there's a lot of them back here dealing with a lot of stuff that need help every
[47:32.480 --> 47:38.640]  day well i mean i mean if if hit squads in the government death squads continue to do stuff like
[47:38.640 --> 47:42.320]  business becoming obvious they are we don't know if it's this group they're just under
[47:42.320 --> 47:47.360]  investigation by the people's press do they just think it's going to go on forever and nobody's
[47:47.360 --> 47:51.520]  going to stand up i mean i mean do they just think everybody's going to roll over while they kill
[47:51.520 --> 47:58.320]  people no they messed up when they uh they should have got rid of that email somehow because uh
[47:58.320 --> 48:02.800]  now that that's out i mean it already makes it look shady on top all the things that have unfolded
[48:02.800 --> 48:07.520]  so far i mean right i mean right now at this point they have nowhere to go i mean it's out
[48:07.520 --> 48:13.040]  there everyone knows this is definitely a cover-up and you know any any more deaths happen from this
[48:13.040 --> 48:17.520]  it's just going to make it blow up in their face well see that's what always brings down
[48:17.520 --> 48:25.680]  tyrants is the commitment of men that are not cowards and uh as we do this more and more people
[48:25.680 --> 48:29.680]  are going to join us and it's already too late i said that before you came on it's already too late
[48:31.120 --> 48:36.160]  we will expose this one way or the other no matter what happens i mean i'm having people
[48:36.160 --> 48:43.360]  reporters from china japan ireland australia russia i mean everywhere everyone is you know
[48:44.080 --> 48:48.560]  blending their hands out to try to help out i mean i have everyone asking me on a daily basis
[48:48.560 --> 48:53.440]  i receive probably upwards of 50 to 100 emails a day from people just saying that you know hey
[48:53.440 --> 48:58.080]  you know i'll lend you a hand i can help the huffington post all these different media groups
[48:58.080 --> 49:01.840]  are always hitting me up trying to find out if they can help if they can look in what are my
[49:01.840 --> 49:05.840]  ideas can they help out and look into it exactly because if the press doesn't hang together that's
[49:05.840 --> 49:11.200]  what mike said before they killed him if we don't all come together it's over well this should open
[49:11.200 --> 49:15.760]  some people's eyes and let them know that you know it's time to come together it's time to speak up
[49:15.760 --> 49:18.720]  it's time to stop being afraid of these guys because they should be afraid of us
[49:19.760 --> 49:24.640]  but i just can't believe because i guarantee you the way it works now they think it's actually
[49:24.640 --> 49:30.160]  authorized because the white house tells them they can kill somebody that it's okay or or a federal
[49:30.160 --> 49:35.680]  agency it's not okay to blow reporters up just because some crook told you hire up just because
[49:35.680 --> 49:40.880]  hitler tells you it's okay to arrest people and mass and kill innocent people doesn't mean it's okay
[49:42.880 --> 49:47.440]  that's true i mean throughout history people in the military are in or in secret police go well
[49:47.440 --> 49:52.240]  i've been told to do this so it's okay don't they know how how much danger they're in from
[49:52.240 --> 49:56.880]  their bosses that they're doing things like this under orders don't they know they're gonna be taken
[49:56.880 --> 50:06.800]  out by their own bosses yep well staff sergeant biggs anything else you think needs to be added
[50:06.800 --> 50:11.520]  here before we go out there with you for an investigative report well another thing too though
[50:11.520 --> 50:17.040]  it was interesting i know i remember last time i told you that uh you know the la pd had stopped by
[50:17.040 --> 50:20.560]  his place a few days prior to that so that's something i definitely need to find out i want
[50:20.560 --> 50:25.040]  to look into that and then another thing i had a couple of his close friends uh investigative
[50:25.040 --> 50:30.160]  reporter buddies contact me in the past few days and they said you know right around five days prior
[50:30.160 --> 50:35.760]  to his death he got to where he started talking in code over the phone and he was just completely
[50:35.760 --> 50:41.520]  changed and you know i had noticed that he had been a little bit different but that's a little
[50:41.520 --> 50:45.840]  bit different he's never really spoken in code and then also in that email how he uses a couple
[50:45.840 --> 50:51.440]  of different terms that i find to be interesting so i address an la i'm gonna go check out the
[50:51.440 --> 50:56.240]  place there as well look around but uh it's gonna be good that we get out there and do that it's gonna
[50:57.600 --> 51:04.240]  it's gonna open up a lot of eyes that aren't already open absolutely beat the bushes and show the
[51:04.800 --> 51:09.200]  dinosaur media how it's done because they're all trying to ignore it the big dominant media
[51:09.200 --> 51:14.880]  but the alternative media uh the real media the foreign mainstream media from as you said from
[51:14.880 --> 51:21.040]  england to russia the media journalists get this i mean just ten years ago if a journalist was killed
[51:21.040 --> 51:26.720]  like this the other journalists would come out of the woodwork even mainstream journalists but now
[51:27.440 --> 51:30.880]  i've talked to so many mainline journalists off record and they and they're scared
[51:31.440 --> 51:38.800]  well they should be scared of not standing up i just i keep repeating that but it's so elementary
[51:42.240 --> 51:45.680]  go over your list any other points that you're gonna make until we uh
[51:45.680 --> 51:51.600]  uh obviously get live reports from you uh on the street with my crew because we can do live video
[51:51.600 --> 51:58.960]  reports uh from where he uh died uh we're gonna have live feed uh iphones and droids with you
[51:59.760 --> 52:05.120]  so in case anything happens it's all gonna be going up so everybody can see it uh other points
[52:05.840 --> 52:13.120]  in in your list that folks need to know about um besides the uh the homeland security um
[52:13.120 --> 52:21.040]  um i've got a uh few people that uh live down in la that are uh foe experts um things like that
[52:21.040 --> 52:25.520]  that i'm gonna try to meet up with as well and um see what we can do i'm gonna try to meet up with
[52:25.520 --> 52:31.920]  a lawyer that specializes uh in a lot of these types of deals and um see if there's any way that
[52:31.920 --> 52:37.120]  we could actually maybe file a lawsuit against the la pd and hopefully in that way we could probably
[52:37.120 --> 52:42.320]  get uh that report out if they won't give it to us absolutely outside of that a lot of this
[52:42.320 --> 52:48.400]  stuff i want to kind of keep to the best until we get there yeah yeah that's smart and obviously i'll
[52:49.360 --> 52:53.600]  you've been out there on the physical battlefield that has a lot of enemy humance stuff going on
[52:53.600 --> 52:57.600]  in iraq and afghanistan so you're you're not a spring chicken you didn't follow up the turnip
[52:57.600 --> 53:03.920]  truck i've been doing this for 18 years here in the u.s learning as i went just how bizarre the
[53:03.920 --> 53:09.840]  system is and i'm really tempted to go out there myself it's just that i'll end up who knows i might
[53:09.840 --> 53:13.280]  actually go out there i'm i'm always saying who might have sent to bill derberg this year and
[53:13.280 --> 53:20.560]  then i send myself um but uh you know the big issue is you can pretty quick obviously too
[53:20.560 --> 53:26.800]  they will try to assign infiltrators to us just to give us this info or to talk about crimes
[53:26.800 --> 53:31.760]  or to get with your you know buy your luggage and plant drugs on you i mean obviously there's
[53:31.760 --> 53:35.840]  you got to be i'm not trying to make you paranoid a staff sergeant but but but just
[53:35.840 --> 53:42.160]  uh i mean i would have rooms that are joined with the door open between them and stuff like that
[53:42.160 --> 53:48.400]  because i've had them break in my room steal our money uh i've had like i'm trying to cover a military
[53:48.400 --> 53:53.440]  gun confiscation drill and i've got mike hanson in studio tomorrow it was an eyewitness to it and
[53:53.440 --> 53:58.240]  a guy jumps out of the bushes and starts setting fires saying alex why are you setting fires
[53:58.800 --> 54:03.040]  i'm not saying any of that will happen but if if this is as bad as we think it is
[54:03.040 --> 54:06.960]  uh you'll probably see some weird stuff going on is what i'm telling you
[54:07.520 --> 54:10.880]  oh that's all right i'm gonna be i'm i'm ready i am fully prepared
[54:12.160 --> 54:16.720]  yeah i mean they they've they've gotten more to worry about me than anything
[54:16.720 --> 54:22.240]  oh i understand well it it and plus when they come out of the woodwork it's pretty obvious too
[54:22.240 --> 54:26.720]  they'll just walk up when we're at some event not not even knowing you know how we were there
[54:26.720 --> 54:31.600]  they'll be tracking our cell phones and they'll say hi sergeant bigs let's kill police together
[54:31.600 --> 54:35.920]  and then have somebody with a camera there and then put out a video saying we were going to
[54:35.920 --> 54:41.280]  kill police i'm telling you like one time i was in confronting michelle malkin and they had people
[54:41.280 --> 54:46.080]  get behind me and yell kill michelle malkin with tv crews there who that edited it and had it on
[54:46.080 --> 54:51.760]  national tv within one hour that's an example of dirty tricks so i'm just filling you and the
[54:51.760 --> 54:59.440]  audience in on how they come at left field from you it's it's bizarre i understand but but i mean
[54:59.440 --> 55:05.120]  nothing will probably happen if they're smart they'll leave us alone so i'm not trying to like
[55:05.120 --> 55:11.440]  dramatize this i'm just telling people the type of stuff i've seen no let's go it's better to go
[55:11.440 --> 55:14.800]  in there prepared than not go prepared at all well i would imagine when you were in iraq and
[55:14.800 --> 55:18.640]  afghanistan it's it's not somebody trying to plant drugs on he's trying to plant a hand grenade on
[55:18.640 --> 55:24.480]  you yeah what type of stuff you have to deal with overseas you said you were even hit by ied's and
[55:24.480 --> 55:29.520]  stuff i mean is it basically pretty accurate in the hurt locker like you don't know the
[55:29.520 --> 55:35.920]  village kids trying to sell you a dvd or a bomb um we had a one mission we had a we were going
[55:35.920 --> 55:42.160]  through a bazaar in iraq and um we actually had a kid throw a grenade at one of the humbees and one
[55:42.160 --> 55:47.040]  of our guys now was completely deaf because it went off right out there side his head um luckily
[55:47.040 --> 55:51.600]  was down in the turret so he was kind of covered but it went off and i mean they'll use anybody you
[55:51.600 --> 55:58.400]  know dead animals it doesn't matter i mean one time i was driving a convoy in front of us got hit
[55:58.400 --> 56:03.200]  and we waited 10 hours almost it was already it was night time when it happened the sunlight's coming
[56:03.200 --> 56:07.360]  up and they're telling us to move i'm in the first vehicle we're driving over the samarib i press
[56:07.360 --> 56:12.480]  heading from north to south on tampa which is a route in iraq a main route heading towards camp
[56:12.480 --> 56:17.440]  anaconda and i'm just peeking over this bridge and i remember the last thing i said was that looks
[56:17.440 --> 56:22.880]  like a and then my vehicle just exploded and was launched up into the air all four wheels were blowing
[56:22.880 --> 56:28.960]  off and it teeter tottered and flipped over and uh caught on fire and i mean just going back to that
[56:29.920 --> 56:35.280]  i mean i got hit with a big iad enough to launch a heavy vehicle up in the air and in no way was
[56:35.280 --> 56:41.440]  my vehicle engulfed in flames like mike's was well they clearly put the bomb right on the gas tank

[56:55.920 --> 57:00.400]  lash out and sometimes they just can't help it they've got this idea that they're invincible
[57:00.400 --> 57:05.200]  they may lash out at us or they may play it smart and leave us alone and they leave us alone it may
[57:05.200 --> 57:12.560]  mean that it's uh it's a bad trail but uh because there are other groups as well well i also have a

[01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:21.600]  so that's just some of the news up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com
[01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:26.560]  now joining us for the balance of the hour is somebody that i've been a big fan of for a long
[01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:32.320]  time and john bound said he had a crush on her when he was a teenager uh but uh mary lou hanner
[01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:36.720]  and i'd seen her on 16 minutes we're going to play a clip of that coming up later i'd you know
[01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:42.480]  seen her in different than the the movie about uh andy kaufman i had but i heard her a couple
[01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:48.880]  years ago on howard stern and he was he was doing these memory games whether and she could remember
[01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:53.040]  it all and she was just one of the best interviews i've heard because i usually am in the car about
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:58.080]  30 minutes i sat there in the parking lot and listened like a whole hour of the interview so
[01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:02.960]  i thought let me get her on the air now i can't do is go to an interview uh as howard stern and i
[01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:09.440]  won't ask his uh racy of questions but uh she's also a gc n radio host in the morning at gcnlive.com
[01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:15.440]  it had picked up my stations all over the country right now uh and i am just very very excited
[01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:20.320]  to have her with us but she was in the total recall episode of 60 minutes uh and another
[01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:25.840]  60 minutes episode called uh endless memory and i've seen a bunch of these very fascinating
[01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:31.680]  and the endless memory part two uh and she's been on a bunch of other shows and she has i guess
[01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:39.200]  what they call highly superior autobiographical memory and i find this fascinating because i had
[01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:43.200]  somewhat of a photographic memory until i was about 30 or so and it's not as good but nothing
[01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:50.720]  like hers i mean if i focused on something then i can remember it perfectly and vividly but it's
[01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:55.680]  it's hit or miss with her it's it's it's total and i wonder if that continues and she's also a
[01:14:55.680 --> 01:15:01.600]  best-selling author on on uh rearing children and so much more so mary lou henner thank you so much
[01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:06.480]  for coming on with us oh my gosh what an introduction thank you thank you i'm a fan of yours as well
[01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:11.360]  and i'm sure you get told this all the time but you sound so much like charlie sheen do you hear
[01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:16.400]  you hear that all the time i do sound like charlie sheen oh so much like him he's spent time i think
[01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:23.440]  he's an incredible actor he's he's he's you know i never i think sometimes when i'm hurrying i now
[01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:28.400]  that you say that i kind of have a cadence like him yeah you do very much so very much but then
[01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:34.240]  other times other times i sound kind of like rush limbaugh but i'm not doing it on purpose this
[01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:39.600]  is how i talk sexier much sexier sound quality to your voice than rush limbaugh you're too sweet
[01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:44.560]  no it's true it's absolutely true much more like charlie sheen well i'm friends with charlie
[01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:49.440]  so uh he's got he's got a great voice he's a he's a wonderful actor and i i got to do an
[01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:53.920]  episode of two and a half men but i didn't get to do with him i got to do it with ashton kutcher
[01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:58.160]  and john crier and the rest of the team but i'm a big fan of charlie's as well and i know his family
[01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:03.600]  so yeah aren't they sweethearts they're incredible his mom and i yeah she and i have the exact same
[01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:09.760]  birth they were both born april 6 so uh and and my first husband was fregic forest who and who
[01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:17.360]  worked of course with marty sheen charlie's father um on apocalypse now and then uh he and i worked
[01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:23.920]  here marty and i worked together in uh an episode of a television and it's funny as i'm talking to you
[01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:28.160]  all these dates are flooding through my head because i could say oh yeah he and i did this thing
[01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:34.720]  september the 23rd started on monday september 23rd of 1985 and oh yeah we you know it's like like
[01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:38.320]  all these different dates come flooding through and everything that you said in the introduction
[01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:45.040]  like the 60 minutes you know that was instantly uh uh december 19th 2010 and you know it's so it's like
[01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:50.560]  all these different dates come into my head very quickly and so you haven't lost any of it as you
[01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:56.160]  get older no you know it's so funny i always had it even as a child i had it i mean even at six years
[01:16:56.160 --> 01:17:01.120]  old people would call me the memory kid and i'd fall asleep at night saying what did i do a year ago
[01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:05.760]  on this very same day in school and you know what did i do when i was my little brother lauren's age
[01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:10.480]  and you know i so i was always exercising it even as a kid because it was something easy to do and
[01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:14.640]  it was kind of fun to fall asleep that way with that kind of meditation but as i've gotten older
[01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:20.160]  i think mainly because i'm asked about it so much more than i ever was these past two years
[01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:25.440]  since six two and a half years since 60 minutes was on that because i'm constantly exercising at
[01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:29.760]  everything getting better people yeah it's actually getting better yesterday i was on the set of
[01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:34.960]  unforgettable which is my show that's on cbs about a doc about a cop who has my memory poppy
[01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:41.120]  montgomery plays the part and uh we're going back on the air uh july 28th and so i was on the set
[01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:44.640]  yesterday and people were asking me all kinds of things oh remember the last time you were here and
[01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:48.880]  what was i wearing and stuff like that so it's fun it's kind of fun to to do that now i will never
[01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:56.240]  forget our interview today july 16 wow but i can tell that having this incredibly rare gift
[01:17:57.360 --> 01:18:03.280]  it's not just a gift it then becomes who you are because when i start talking about any news item
[01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:10.480]  or anything a thousand things that are connected to it not so much the date but but that too
[01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:17.360]  us codes and bill numbers and things and and other things that connect to it all rush to the four
[01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:23.360]  and so that's when i start going absolutely absolutely it's like i always say you know
[01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:27.600]  everybody remembers something especially well people who think they have no memory at all
[01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:30.720]  they remember something special in there they remember something especially well in their
[01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:35.280]  lives and i always say that in the jigsaw puzzle of your life what are the hard-edged pieces you
[01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:39.360]  know what it would help you connect the other things you do it naturally because you probably
[01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:45.360]  have a very astute well highly trained memory because you love information and you love making
[01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:50.080]  connections anyway so you have all of this completely outlined you you you have much
[01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:54.720]  more than even the border of the jigsaw puzzle of your life but it is it's all about interconnecting
[01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:59.280]  and interlocking different bits of information so that's the power of it i mean that's why
[01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:04.400]  you know in my book total memory makeover i keep trying to teach people no you are you can remember
[01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:10.240]  so much more than you do you just don't know how to retain retrieve you know receive retain and
[01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:15.600]  then retrieve the information we're gonna get out some of your websites here in a moment but but
[01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:20.720]  what's the best site to visit for all your sites oh well marylou.com will connect you with everything
[01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:26.000]  i've been teaching classes online for 13 years i've 30 coaches who teach my program with me
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:31.200]  we have classes every month i'm in the chat room but also you can connect to marylou show.com you
[01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:36.480]  know the show on gcn or you can go to gcn but everything marylou.com will have the most information
[01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:42.480]  if you want everything from recipes to for how to find the web the the radio show and and what's
[01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:49.840]  coming up next you know in terms it's all there it seems like this culture tries to dumb everything
[01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:56.320]  down and simplify it all trying to get people not to use their memory i think the essence of
[01:19:56.320 --> 01:20:03.920]  freedom is having a will to be free and not lay down to corruption and to learn but also to to
[01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:10.880]  remember things i mean this is so obvious it's it's silly to say but to have a memory if we remember
[01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:16.720]  all the lies of the politicians and if we remember how they incrementally take our rights then the
[01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:21.360]  whole roadmap's there instead of living just right now absolutely and if you remember how the advice
[01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:25.840]  of your doctor just made you stave off disease for a short period of time until you were paying
[01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:30.480]  customer again rather than learning how to use your own body to heal yourself you know if you
[01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:37.040]  can start remembering things it's amazing how you start to head off the red flags that are such a part
[01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:42.960]  of our culture you know i never thought about that that i that i sound like charlie sheen but
[01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:47.360]  but actually actually now that i hear myself talking i do sound a little bit like charlie sheen
[01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:53.360]  at least in the cadence that's a weird epiphany but i guess with your super brain you're then able to
[01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:59.760]  remember his voice suddenly and then put it together with my voice what is that like how many people
[01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:06.000]  have your gift a and and and b have you ever met any of them and what is that like well they showed
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:10.080]  us on 60 minutes there were five of us that were in the same room meeting and at that point there
[01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:14.400]  were only six of us the person who started it all basically i mean everybody's gone through their
[01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:19.360]  lives having the memory but there was a woman by the name of jill price who came forward approached
[01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:26.480]  the university of uh of uh the university of california at urvine uh dr james mcgaw is like the
[01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:30.960]  the grand master of memory and he proved that memory is tied to adrenaline he had already
[01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:35.120]  been featured on 60 minutes etc so she went to him and she said he said oh if you're having
[01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:38.960]  trouble with memory maybe you should read this book or that but she said no my problem is i
[01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:44.000]  can't forget i don't forget anything the matter they had never seen anything like it there there
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:48.960]  was nothing in medical journals anywhere scientific books nothing about it so they tested her for many
[01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:54.160]  years and then they offered the story to both 60 minutes leslie stahl and to diane soyer on
[01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:59.280]  primetime live and leslie who's have been a friend of mine for a long time she basically said uh
[01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:04.000]  hate to burst your bubble it's not that unusual my friend mary lou henner has the same memory
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:10.640]  so they turned the story down and she and jill price went on diane soyer well now leslie called me
[01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:15.600]  three years later she said it turns out it is very unusual they've only found a few more people
[01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:21.840]  i want you to go to uc urvine you're gonna be tested on camera so i was tested on camera
[01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:26.960]  on november the fourth and the fifth of 2009 anyway so i was tested on camera and then on the sixth
[01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:31.760]  and seventh of december of that same year and then it took a year for them to do all of the
[01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:37.600]  research on other brains and they got all these different other age range and male female etc etc
[01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:42.080]  so there was the group of six of us they tested our brains in terms of measurements because they
[01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:47.440]  wired us put us through mri's took about 300 measurements of our brains and what they discovered
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:53.760]  is that there are nine areas of our brains that are 10 times larger than the normal persons wow
[01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:58.720]  10 times larger i saw the i saw you would be freaked out if you saw the x-rays it's pretty
[01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:03.040]  crazy because you see everybody the normal brain and then you see i saw my brain and i went oh my
[01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:08.960]  gosh it's crazy how big this area is a few times so uh but what they found is they have found six
[01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:13.280]  more people that are now documented so are there there are 12 of us who've been to all so you're
[01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:19.360]  like an x woman i mean it so it's a good mutation to have you're like superwoman yeah well howard
[01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:23.440]  stern said you know i mean this is like superhero status and everything i was very it was a very
[01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:29.440]  funny interview but what's crazy is you were already an incredibly successful tv movie star
[01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:34.880]  best-selling author it just shows why you were already so so successful not just good looking
[01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:40.400]  but also very intelligent and you're very bubbly and very electric and then it just you didn't even
[01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:46.960]  understand how special you really were and uh this far into your career it's like a whole
[01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:52.960]  another area that you recognize how special you are once once other people i guess basically
[01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:58.640]  recognized it think of how many other incredible human gifts are out there that just haven't been
[01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:02.640]  recognized sure absolutely and you know what's really funny is that i used to talk about this
[01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:06.960]  in interviews and i'd say oh well give me any date i remember my entire life give me any date
[01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:14.000]  within my lifetime and people would say okay what did you have two weeks ago for lunch and i think
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:19.120]  why are you asking me that question that's like so easy but people couldn't wrap their minds around
[01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:23.440]  this whole thing they couldn't people they had no idea what i was talking about until
[01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:29.360]  dr mcgaw the leslie stall you know 60 minutes kind of sanctioned it and the medical you know the
[01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:34.000]  medical profession of course and the scientists of course had a name for it and tested us enough
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:39.040]  to have some kind of explanation for it all so they still don't know how it came about
[01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:44.240]  but they definitely know that there is something different about our brains by far what area of
[01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:48.880]  the brain is it i mean is it in between the lower centers and the cerebral cortex what's
[01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:54.160]  what's the area of the brain um it's connected somewhat to the hippocampus and to the caudate
[01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:59.200]  nucleus but it isn't in those places i don't even know the name of it because they you know when i
[01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:04.000]  see it on a chart it's all like letters and numbers it's not even sure i understand it's it's all sub
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:09.600]  regions yeah all these different sub regions but what was interesting is they took the measurements
[01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:17.920]  of all of us and the 12 of us moved like this among the 100 people that they tested so we all
[01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:24.000]  were in the same group it was crazy when i saw the statistics and you know they had the 300
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:29.440]  uh areas of the brain listed in terms of like some kind of you know it looked like a logarithm or
[01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:35.360]  something and so uh but you saw the 12 of us kind of moved together and and our numbers i mean it
[01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:40.240]  was really quite fascinating and the testing is ongoing i mean i've answered over a thousand
[01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:46.000]  questions you know the initial testing is crazy they test you on every with every memory test
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:50.240]  they've ever created whether it's number sequencing backwards and forwards looking at something
[01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:56.320]  visual being read a story and then repeating it verbatim asking questions about it color of things
[01:25:57.440 --> 01:26:02.080]  and then you get into the date testing and that's really crazy so they do all of these
[01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:06.640]  different dates and there's this kind of gold standard hundred question tests and then they
[01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:11.120]  find things on each individual person and ask us questions like that sure sure let me be honest
[01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:19.840]  with you i was never a big drinker but i like to drink sometimes just to stop thinking because
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:24.000]  obviously i'm not that articulate on air but but just sitting there in a room my brain
[01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:30.720]  has such complex thoughts and things that that being sober is like being on a super drug or
[01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:38.080]  something and then it's almost fun to eat a big meal or you know drink whatever so that i can can
[01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:45.680]  rest my brain uh what is it like for you to have you know a brain 10 times uh uh more complex than
[01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:50.640]  that i mean i can see that it animates you and you've got all this energy to do you know two
[01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:56.000]  two three hour radio shows a day tv shows write books i mean what is it like how do you handle it
[01:26:56.640 --> 01:26:59.600]  well it's funny that you said that thing about drinking because people always say to me
[01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:03.920]  do you ever have a drink do you ever go i said oh you mean sake land you know it's almost like i
[01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:09.600]  like sake so i say oh it's like you go someplace else and then there's like a whole memory thing
[01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:13.600]  that happens over in sake land you know it's like but i know what you mean it's like sometimes you
[01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:18.880]  just have to shut down um i'm not much of a sleeper i sleep about five hours a night but when i have
[01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:24.960]  two switches on or off so when i'm out i am out and i really sleep very well and very soundly
[01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:29.840]  it's rare that i don't sleep really soundly for at least five hours but it it is it's going on all
[01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:34.800]  the time but it's also like a pilot light you know it's something if i'm driving in my car and all
[01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:38.800]  of a sudden the song comes on i can like scroll through every time i've ever heard that song
[01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:42.880]  from the first time to the last time unbelievable i can just say oh well you know i'm talking to
[01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:47.760]  my sister on the phone well not like this because you have to use you know uh headsets but i'm talking
[01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:52.000]  to my sister on the phone and the song comes on i'll go oh that reminds me of and then i'll go right
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:57.280]  back to my conversation with my sister you know so it's like always there and it's available to me
[01:27:57.280 --> 01:28:02.240]  which is maybe it's power that i can use sure do the scientists think this is the next level of
[01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:08.160]  humanity or do they believe that small numbers of humans because usually there wasn't seven and
[01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:12.640]  you know billion people so there's only maybe a hundred people they think like you maybe worldwide
[01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:19.360]  or something then then then maybe maybe you've never existed before and until now they think that
[01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:23.120]  it's new they think it's new and we might be evolving to this but they don't know they still
[01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:28.720]  don't know there's the testing is going on forever now i mean going on as i said continues to go on
[01:28:29.840 --> 01:28:34.880]  they have more people that they're testing that they're putting through what the 12 of us have been
[01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:41.840]  through but uh they have kind of been waiting maybe 50 i heard 50 and then i heard 30 oh i bet
[01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:49.440]  i bet the pentagon's interested in you yeah you know my son has it but he doesn't exercise it as much
[01:28:49.440 --> 01:28:54.160]  but i know he has it he's 17 they're going to test him because they can't test them with MRIs until
[01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:59.360]  they're 18 well also i mean there's maybe a hundred or so a couple hundred who knows of people that
[01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:04.240]  have you like the super brain like you but then there's people down probably hundreds of thousands
[01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:08.960]  millions that just have more advanced memories than the average person but as you said anybody
[01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:13.760]  can train and develop and expand their memory and learn how to access it absolutely and we've
[01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:17.760]  gotten so lazy and not only that i mean everything is so convenient for us it's all speed dialed and

[01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:44.080]  be with us in the fourth hour today uh to talk about the whole situation with trevon martin and
[01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:49.120]  of course the george zimmerman situation uh there is a lot of violence going on
[01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:54.000]  on mary lou i want to get into mary lou henner joins us if you just tuned in folks
[01:33:54.640 --> 01:34:03.520]  reminds me of uh do you remember wednesday april 29th 1992 uh the riot king riots in los angeles
[01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:09.200]  it was horrible it was terrible it didn't accomplish anything it's terrible i mean the
[01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:14.720]  whole thing the whole situation is so sad for everybody and everything and it's just um anyway
[01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:20.080]  and political correctness and groveling over all this and everybody fighting with each other i think
[01:34:20.080 --> 01:34:28.320]  only makes it worse i mean how does beating up or shooting some white people uh bring trevon martin
[01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:35.040]  back and or how does the clan lynching some black guy randomly i mean what does that do i just don't
[01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:40.320]  get fighting with each other over what color we are but a lot of people i guess who were shallow
[01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:45.600]  uh it just makes sense to them what do you think about this race obsession by the media
[01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:51.440]  you know it's so funny because having grown up in chicago and having grown up in show business you
[01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:58.080]  know my career has been mostly in show business it doesn't have that same kind of it just doesn't
[01:34:58.080 --> 01:35:02.720]  have that same kind of zeitgeist it just doesn't you know and so when i see people do it i feel
[01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:08.880]  like where are we are we you know 50 years ago what's going on let's all kind of calm down and and
[01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:15.440]  just you know work together and and not polarize so much well sure it's the mainstream media wants
[01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:21.600]  to divide and conquer but they want the polarization as a tool of statecraft and in the name of fighting
[01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:27.280]  racism they hype it up and make it the central issue to distract from things i want to i want to
[01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:31.040]  get into child rearing with you i want to get into what you're currently doing there's so many
[01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:36.160]  questions i've got but one thing we're both involved in i have info wars health dot com
[01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:42.800]  you promote young jeffrey products as well i uh i mean you're obviously in great shape i got into
[01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:50.000]  this because i saw friends and family have dramatic weight loss health uh memory with the hundreds of
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:54.480]  young jeffrey products that we have at info wars health dot com but you're now promoting it and
[01:35:54.480 --> 01:36:00.160]  just to put a plug in here this is what funds the show to a great extent beyond tangy tangerine 2.0
[01:36:00.160 --> 01:36:05.360]  now available at info wars health dot com probiotics prebiotics amino acids essential
[01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:10.800]  cofactors and more whole foods trace minerals antioxidants now folks wanted it all certified
[01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:16.240]  organic non-gmo well the old tangy tangerine pretty much is but they couldn't get it certified
[01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:21.440]  because of some of the sourcing this has an eight thousand uh orac a total score the old one had
[01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:27.280]  five thousand uh and something in it five thousand seven hundred and forty five if memory serves this
[01:36:27.280 --> 01:36:33.680]  has eight thousand ladies and gentlemen you can get free shipping at info wars health dot com
[01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:39.280]  when you sign up for auto ship and there's almost 400 other products uh there on the site they now
[01:36:39.280 --> 01:36:44.400]  have osteo fx beyond osteo fx the one i like i think that's a great product and i think it
[01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:48.800]  it goes immediately into your body so that's what i love about it i think it's like you know i mean
[01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:53.280]  because let's face it i i'm the world's greatest eater and i still can't get everything from my food
[01:36:53.280 --> 01:36:57.600]  unfortunately because of the way the food is processed and the way the food is given to us and
[01:36:57.600 --> 01:37:01.680]  i eat in restaurants once in a while and i eat on an airplane once in a while and that's why i think
[01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:06.480]  what dr walloch is on to is a really smart thing and believe me i've been i've been in the health
[01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:12.480]  business for over 30 34 years this year is my 34th health birthday because i got into it after
[01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:18.240]  most my parents died my father died of a heart attack at 52 my mother died of arthritis at 58
[01:37:18.880 --> 01:37:24.400]  arthritis died of arthritis died of arthritis they can call it other stuff it would she died of
[01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:28.960]  arthritis because she didn't have the right information and so i became this obsessed
[01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:34.240]  student of health absolutely i have a family member who when she was 20 what couldn't even get out of
[01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:39.760]  bed and then got another doctor that said it's nutrition and it's a autoimmune thing in your
[01:37:39.760 --> 01:37:44.560]  joints and you've got to run and you've got to eat healthy gotta move yeah absolutely it makes me
[01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:49.760]  crazy and then now she doesn't have any arthritis yeah it makes me crazy that we give all this power
[01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:54.640]  to a stupid pill or we think oh let's do the fight on cancer and let's do this and stuff
[01:37:54.640 --> 01:37:59.920]  and and nobody is paying attention to the power in the a plate of food i mean food a plate of food
[01:37:59.920 --> 01:38:04.800]  has much more power than almost anything else that you can ingest so it's very important for you to
[01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:09.440]  first of all get the highest quality food most nutrient-dense food that you possibly can a plant
[01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:15.280]  based diet whenever you can whether it's 20 40 60 or 80 percent of your diet and do not think that
[01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:19.600]  your doctor is going to have all the answers because something that you do at least two or three
[01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:25.600]  times a day is eat and most doctors have had absolutely no counseling no classes whatsoever
[01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:31.280]  in nutrition it's not even oh that's admitted hospitals have the worst food period of anywhere
[01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:36.400]  in major studies so again folks info wars health dot com there's also a toll-free number if you
[01:38:36.400 --> 01:38:41.120]  want to call that get a free catalog but the catalog's online info wars health dot com and
[01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:46.720]  all i do is i go out and find the very best thing whether it's water filtration whether it's books
[01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:52.800]  films whatever in a free market to fund my political ideology of libertarian populist constitutional
[01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:57.520]  ideas and that's why i promote young javity and when folks go to info wars health dot com and get
[01:38:57.520 --> 01:39:03.200]  it there it supports us and what we're doing and then you can also go and sign up under young javity
[01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:09.520]  at mary lou dot com as well because she's doing it she's promoting it and it's it's not only about
[01:39:09.520 --> 01:39:14.640]  funding our other messages with things like this it's about win win win promoting things we know
[01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:21.680]  we're great the revolution of health the revolution of high density uh nutritious plant-derived things
[01:39:21.680 --> 01:39:28.320]  like you get in beyond tenney tangerine 2.0 and it's really about goodwill win win win win win
[01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:33.920]  info wars health dot com folks how can you think how can you how can you live your life if if all
[01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:38.320]  the nutrients aren't going to your brain and to your other organs and you know you can't if all
[01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:42.960]  you're doing is spending your time digesting because let's face it we are stuffing our faces
[01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:49.520]  but we are starving our bodies and our bodies are so so deprived of nutrients that they don't
[01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:53.920]  nothing knows how to power itself nothing the body doesn't know how to power itself and so
[01:39:53.920 --> 01:39:58.400]  that's why it's so important to at least take these kinds of supplements because if you don't if you
[01:39:58.400 --> 01:40:03.440]  can't eat a perfect diet at least and even when you can something is missing so this is a great
[01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:08.960]  way to start well of course they've had the osteo fx that pro football players you name it uh rave
[01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:13.200]  about we're going to get some of them on the show uh people they're going to have a knee replacement
[01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:17.520]  so basketball players you name it they get on this miraculous ted anderson the owner of this
[01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:21.840]  network was going to have to have knee surgery that's why he said you got to look into this
[01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:26.240]  youngjevity and then family looked into it i said here take these samples what do you think
[01:40:26.240 --> 01:40:33.280]  and my mom is a triathlete said this is dramatic uh now they've got the new powdered beyond osteo fx
[01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:38.160]  available at info wars health dot com what are your favorite youngjevity products and then we'll
[01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:43.600]  move on okay my favorites are osteo fx because you know as a mom i have a mom who died of arthritis
[01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:49.360]  and i feel like there's no way that we're going to get the right amount of what we need that product
[01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:54.160]  is a great way to go and i like the ultimate classic as well those are my two favorites and
[01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:58.240]  of course i like a lot of the makeup products and the the chocolate's pretty good and i'm not even a
[01:40:58.240 --> 01:41:03.520]  chocolate either but if i do have dark chocolate no dairy then um you know because i'm i'm so anti
[01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:08.560]  dairy that's probably my biggest soapbox because to me that was the number one change in my life
[01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:13.440]  giving up dairy products but i go through its rolls i mean i know if i quit dairy i lose
[01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:18.480]  even more weight and get even healthier i mean i'm kind of built like ben grim now i got i'm not
[01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:24.160]  even really fat i just got big muscles but but i'm addicted how do i get off of it i know it's
[01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:30.400]  the it's the dopamine um it's you know it's most of those foods because flavor adheres to fat
[01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:36.160]  so anything that's got sugar or salt because let's face it all dairy products are supposed to do is
[01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:42.080]  turn a 50 pound calf into a 300 pound cow in six months that's it that's what it's designed for
[01:41:42.080 --> 01:41:47.120]  it's a for an animal that's got nine feet of intestines and four stomachs we have 27 feet
[01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:51.840]  of intestines and one little stomach so it's not even for the same animal so now they take this
[01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:58.640]  undigestible food we can't possibly break it down the proper way because it has the wrong
[01:41:58.640 --> 01:42:04.080]  hormones it's got the wrong enzymes in it it's just not designed for our bodies so now they take
[01:42:04.080 --> 01:42:09.520]  this food that's for another animal and then they take all the water out of it and and put
[01:42:09.520 --> 01:42:14.640]  bacteria in it and then give it tons of salt and then let it age it's called cheese and there we
[01:42:14.640 --> 01:42:20.560]  have it a whole another food that we really can't digest especially even if we hydrate ourselves
[01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:26.000]  so it's it's crazy that we are drinking the breast milk of an animal that we have nothing to do with
[01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:30.960]  go just go go nurse from an orangutan because they're so much closer to you than a cow is and
[01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:36.480]  yet you would never think of doing that i mean it makes me nuts it makes me and i know i used to be
[01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:41.280]  addicted to dairy it was the one thing i looked forward to i used to go on stupid diets where i'd
[01:42:41.280 --> 01:42:47.120]  buy a pound of yarlsburg cheese and chip away at it all day and call it my 1700 calorie a day diet
[01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:52.880]  and then i was wondering why i was fat constipated and had had pimples you know i dropped 54 pounds
[01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:58.560]  from getting healthy 54 pounds from giving up dairy products eating a more plant-based diet
[01:42:58.560 --> 01:43:03.840]  giving up meat giving up sugar giving up anything that would have refined sugar in it i still have
[01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:08.320]  you know things like agave and stuff like that but it's it makes such a difference in your health
[01:43:08.320 --> 01:43:13.120]  because my parents died in their 50s and i did not want to go that way and i also didn't want
[01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:19.840]  it a quality of life not just the numbers i mean in this country we assume that people are going to
[01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:26.080]  be on eight to 11 medications by the time they're 60 years old eight to 11 medications that's crazy
[01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:31.360]  that's nuts to me and we feel like the last 10 years of our lives we're probably going to barely
[01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:35.760]  be able to get out get out of bed or we'll be hooked up to some machine and we'll go out you
[01:43:35.760 --> 01:43:40.960]  know slowly into the night that kind of thing but painfully and that's not necessary it's not
[01:43:41.680 --> 01:43:46.880]  well i i was always a big exercise guy and ran six miles every other day and lifted weights and
[01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:53.280]  looked great but eight all sorts of bad things you name it and then for about 10 years i decided to
[01:43:53.280 --> 01:43:58.320]  just quit everything basically except for going on a few hikes and to work and just got really
[01:43:58.320 --> 01:44:02.960]  unhealthy and now it's been about a four-year process of you know slowly transitioning off of
[01:44:02.960 --> 01:44:08.160]  all that so i want listeners to know you don't have to do all this overnight just start by cutting
[01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:14.720]  back on things exercising some drinking more purified water getting on the beyond tenny tangerine
[01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:21.280]  the osteo fx 2.0 i mean just some basic things like that and you will see dramatic differences
[01:44:21.280 --> 01:44:25.520]  here's an example i always have a cup of coffee in the morning i love how it tastes i might have a
[01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:31.200]  second cup a day but but but in the used to i'd have five cups to be able to work 17 18 hours a
[01:44:31.200 --> 01:44:36.640]  day sometimes when i'm making a film or something now i'll have a beyond tenny tangerine or a
[01:44:36.640 --> 01:44:43.520]  pollen burst plus uh at like five o'clock and i get more energy out of vitamins and minerals
[01:44:43.520 --> 01:44:49.440]  than i do off of coffee yeah i know it's true well we also there's a crash after coffee but i keep i
[01:44:49.440 --> 01:44:54.080]  always say to people and this is what i talk about on my show my whole my whole show the mary lou show
[01:44:54.080 --> 01:44:59.040]  and you can really find all this information at mary lou show dot com it's all life through the
[01:44:59.040 --> 01:45:03.680]  prism of health it's all about getting the message out that you can live a healthier diet you're
[01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:09.680]  never too young or too old to feel healthier than you do right now and it's all progress not perfection
[01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:14.400]  i mean i've been doing this for 34 years and i'm still learning so much it's progress not
[01:45:14.400 --> 01:45:19.200]  perfection it's something small do something small to make yourself feel better if it's just
[01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:24.560]  walk around your block if it's just read a label if it's just make water your only beverage for
[01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:31.680]  like six hours you know and throw some tangerine into it whatever you need to do but there's
[01:45:31.680 --> 01:45:36.400]  something small that you can do today even if it's having better posture there's something
[01:45:36.400 --> 01:45:42.400]  but exactly the journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step and we can either just give
[01:45:42.400 --> 01:45:49.520]  into this toxic world or we can resist it and thrive instead of collapsing but larger issue is
[01:45:49.520 --> 01:45:55.920]  the hydrofluorosalic acid they add to the water they know what that does the gmo where it kills
[01:45:55.920 --> 01:46:00.320]  the bugs that eat it but they say it's safe for us to eat it it's crazy and our children you know
[01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:06.880]  and then it's so unfair of us to give our children the steroids the hormones the the the crap the gmo
[01:46:06.880 --> 01:46:11.200]  is everything you know the sugars all that stuff that we're putting in their foods there's breakfast
[01:46:11.200 --> 01:46:16.160]  cereals they're drive-thru food and then put them on prozac or riddle them and then we but they're
[01:46:16.160 --> 01:46:20.720]  little 40 to 80 pound bodies can't sit still because of all the crap we've given them and then what
[01:46:20.720 --> 01:46:26.560]  happens we get all of a sudden you know we say they have add and adhd and then we give them more
[01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:32.560]  stuff on top of that it's so unfair i wrote a book alex i wrote a book in 2000 called healthy kids
[01:46:32.560 --> 01:46:38.320]  that title was that that title was even available to me is crazy but in 2000 i wrote a book i was
[01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:41.840]  going on the road with anne get your gun and i said i want to visit schools i want to see
[01:46:41.840 --> 01:46:45.280]  lunchrooms i want to see children's hospitals what are they feeding our kids because i had two
[01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:49.280]  little boys i have two little boys they were young at the time they were uh five and six
[01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:53.600]  and i said i want to go visit i like this book my book publisher said we're not going to pay you
[01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:58.240]  nobody's interested in nutrition for kids i said you know what 10 years from now we're going to be
[01:46:58.240 --> 01:47:02.640]  talking about it like crazy because we're facing an epidemic our children are changing overnight
[01:47:02.640 --> 01:47:07.040]  i said don't pay me for the book i want to write this book so i wrote this book healthy kids and
[01:47:07.040 --> 01:47:12.080]  what i discovered about school lunchrooms about you know what we're feeding our children what's in
[01:47:12.080 --> 01:47:17.120]  the food how advertisers focus on an eight-year-old because they feel like if they get you at eight
[01:47:17.120 --> 01:47:21.280]  they have a consumer for life just everything i went through every age whether it was breast
[01:47:21.280 --> 01:47:27.120]  feeding all the way up to college dorm foods etc etc and people thought i was being so controversial
[01:47:27.120 --> 01:47:30.880]  in fact i had one one chapter in there that they wouldn't even let me publish because
[01:47:31.520 --> 01:47:36.720]  i was way too controversial in terms of the connection with uh with uh you know uh the
[01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:42.640]  mercury that was in uh vaccinations for autism and dairy products for autism and gluten for
[01:47:42.640 --> 01:47:47.840]  autism and other diseases and stuff you're a trailblazer i know this has been my passion i i'd
[01:47:47.840 --> 01:47:52.320]  love that i got to do taxi i think it's the most extraordinary experience of my life and i've loved
[01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:57.280]  all the movies i've done but nothing excites me more than talking about health and that's why i
[01:47:57.280 --> 01:48:03.600]  wanted to get well i'm not i'm not kissing up to you you are a renaissance woman i tell you uh i
[01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:08.480]  tell you you are the model of what it's going to take to save this country because as women go
[01:48:08.480 --> 01:48:13.680]  show goes the culture advertisers have always known that and and and it's so good that you're
[01:48:13.680 --> 01:48:19.040]  out there and that you have been trailblazing you also wrote a best-seller on how to get kids to
[01:48:19.040 --> 01:48:24.720]  behave themselves yeah i refuse to raise a brat because i think that this is a brat culture and
[01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:30.800]  little brats turn into big brats little brats become these these um oh yeah it's not just the cops that
[01:48:30.800 --> 01:48:35.520]  act like brats sometimes the public acts like brats public acts like brats the sense of entitlement
[01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:40.240]  and then i of course see it a lot in hollywood it's crazy and it's totally indulge there but i see
[01:48:40.240 --> 01:48:44.960]  people that there's like no work ethic anymore it's like people just take it for granted and you
[01:48:44.960 --> 01:48:50.000]  know just this whole culture of children who i'll tell you a really funny story and i this happened
[01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:54.720]  like right after i wrote the book but um my son was celebrating his birthday very young four years
[01:48:54.720 --> 01:48:59.520]  old and i said i'm sick of these birthday parties i'm going to have our own birthday party we're
[01:48:59.520 --> 01:49:04.240]  going to play the old games that we used to play when we were kids so i start musical chairs right
[01:49:04.240 --> 01:49:09.360]  so it's like the kids are going around in the circle and a little boy gets out it's like okay
[01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:15.200]  you're out he immediately starts to cry and the mom says he's never played this game before i said
[01:49:15.200 --> 01:49:21.280]  all right fine he can stay in so now dee dee dee dee dee another kid okay you're out he's never
[01:49:21.280 --> 01:49:26.800]  played either and i'm like okay time okay you're all still in the game so now round and round i make
[01:49:26.800 --> 01:49:31.280]  sure my son the birthday boy said okay birthday boy you're out and a mother calls me and when she
[01:49:31.280 --> 01:49:36.480]  says we don't play this game anymore i said why she said it's bad for self-esteem i said what about
[01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:40.560]  survival of the fittest what about learning how to navigate well this has been done by the social
[01:49:40.560 --> 01:49:46.480]  engineers is what i'm saying on purpose so that we're all a bunch of jellyfish who can be run over
[01:49:46.480 --> 01:49:51.840]  when you go through adversity that which does not kill you only makes you stronger and i don't agree
[01:49:51.840 --> 01:49:56.640]  with a lot of Nietzschean ideas but i'm here to tell you that's true absolutely that's why i put a
[01:49:56.640 --> 01:50:00.560]  whole chapter in my book called the school of hard knocks because if we don't you know it's well
[01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:04.320]  intentioned parents who cripple their children more than anything else they're the ones who want to
[01:50:04.320 --> 01:50:09.840]  be the the eyes the ears the mouth the legs so many parents carrying their kids to school when
[01:50:09.840 --> 01:50:14.640]  the child can walk it's like if we don't teach that's where self-esteem comes from oh i gotta tell
[01:50:14.640 --> 01:50:19.760]  you i mean my dad i mean i i couldn't do this with my kids now i'll be honest my dad i'd come home
[01:50:19.760 --> 01:50:24.320]  with black eyes he'd go we better fight harder next time and my dad wasn't some macho mr tough guy
[01:50:24.320 --> 01:50:28.160]  and you know nowadays they have weapons and stuff so it's a little bit different but that's why people
[01:50:28.160 --> 01:50:33.440]  used to be tougher and then also once you became strong and confident you weren't gonna pick on
[01:50:33.440 --> 01:50:37.840]  people because a really confident man doesn't even act like that and bullies didn't used to get away
[01:50:37.840 --> 01:50:42.720]  with stuff because they ended up getting their butts kicked nowadays it's a bully with a secret
[01:50:42.720 --> 01:50:46.720]  there's always something in a bullet bullies are the ones who are the real truck who are the ones
[01:50:46.720 --> 01:50:50.080]  who are in trouble they're the ones with the sickness they're the ones who should oh i know
[01:50:50.080 --> 01:50:54.320]  every time i started kicking a bully's butt they start crying at the end of it we'll be right back

[02:00:52.640 --> 02:01:00.480]  lou henner of course of movies and tv shows taxi also well known for her extremely rare we're talking
[02:01:00.480 --> 02:01:06.400]  one out of i don't know 100 million people what they think uh super memory uh she's with us and
[02:01:06.400 --> 02:01:11.600]  just for four or five more minutes uh to finish up a story you started getting into garter cell
[02:01:11.600 --> 02:01:15.680]  and for those that don't know the japanese government has basically outlawed it and said
[02:01:15.680 --> 02:01:20.960]  people shouldn't take it but uh we knew that seven eight years ago uh with the trials were
[02:01:20.960 --> 02:01:26.400]  killing people and it doesn't protect you uh from the virus uh mary lou and there hasn't been
[02:01:26.400 --> 02:01:30.240]  and we haven't had the 20-year study or anything else it was just like a pharmaceutical company's
[02:01:30.240 --> 02:01:35.040]  dream to start inoculating kids you know when you can when you can start playing on the fear of the
[02:01:35.040 --> 02:01:39.440]  parents and you can get them on board pretty soon these innocent victims are like lambs to
[02:01:39.440 --> 02:01:43.280]  slaughter and they're getting inoculated and then first it was the girls and then it was a short
[02:01:43.280 --> 02:01:47.600]  range of ages for the girls then it was like a bigger age of ranges for the girl age range for
[02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:51.840]  the girls and now it's the boys you know and so people parents were calling me because i have two
[02:01:51.840 --> 02:01:56.720]  boys who are 17 and 19 so they were in that sweet spot they're you know their friends their female
[02:01:56.720 --> 02:02:02.720]  friends etc seven eight nine ten years ago the moms were calling me i said do not do not do this we
[02:02:02.720 --> 02:02:07.440]  every generation has something like this whether it's des or thalidomide or whatever it's like there
[02:02:07.440 --> 02:02:13.760]  are so many things that happen where there is some trendy new inoculation or new way to treat
[02:02:13.760 --> 02:02:17.920]  something blah blah blah where they're doing it for the kids and then that's it or it goes to the
[02:02:17.920 --> 02:02:22.880]  moms and then it affects the children so to me it was always a crazy thing and i'm not at all
[02:02:22.880 --> 02:02:28.320]  surprised that japan has outlawed it because it is just this grounds well i mean the fact that
[02:02:28.880 --> 02:02:32.880]  you know i think it was texas said that you absolutely had to get it or it was a note from
[02:02:32.880 --> 02:02:37.360]  some other well it was a hoax perry because he got money from him and said that most of the republicans
[02:02:37.360 --> 02:02:42.800]  and democrats said it's the law you take it and now they're going your little boy is it dirty you
[02:02:42.800 --> 02:02:48.400]  go take it too and then there's thousands of these viruses it covered four of them they say on the
[02:02:48.400 --> 02:02:54.640]  insert doesn't help you causes autoimmune diseases kills a bunch of people and it's a test mary lou
[02:02:54.640 --> 02:02:59.840]  to see if they can kill us and get away with it and people line up to bring damage their kids i'm
[02:02:59.840 --> 02:03:04.240]  telling you it's sick crazy and that's what i'm saying that's why the real freedom is in knowledge
[02:03:04.240 --> 02:03:08.160]  that for the because once you know you can't choose not to know anymore so you better do your
[02:03:08.160 --> 02:03:13.120]  research before you do something with your children you know whatever it is i don't care what it is
[02:03:13.120 --> 02:03:19.040]  and and especially something like this that has that is just a pharmaceutical dream for some crazy
[02:03:19.040 --> 02:03:22.560]  company and then everybody jumps on the bandwagon well what you're saying about the food pyramid
[02:03:22.560 --> 02:03:27.520]  is groups lobby billions of dollars the last 40 years for that on record i think it's like
[02:03:27.520 --> 02:03:33.840]  three billion they've lobbied just for what's recommended they paid billions to tell you
[02:03:33.840 --> 02:03:38.960]  what you're supposed to eat like ever bernay said you will eat bacon with eggs everybody thinks
[02:03:38.960 --> 02:03:44.000]  we've got to have that because they ran a pr thing in the 30s yeah well you know i went i went to
[02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:48.640]  congress i was one of 25 people and i was only one of two private citizens that was allowed to go
[02:03:48.640 --> 02:03:52.640]  and everybody else was from some special interest group i mean there was somebody from the salt
[02:03:52.640 --> 02:03:57.360]  institute there was somebody from the lard institute trying to tell the government that lard was
[02:03:57.360 --> 02:04:02.640]  better than olive oil there were two people from the sugar industry two people from the meat industry
[02:04:02.640 --> 02:04:07.840]  and four people from the dairy industry that you have a cyanide lobby and where they just kill our
[02:04:07.840 --> 02:04:12.240]  kids with cyanide and say it's good i mean i know it's like rat poisoning people say well why won't
[02:04:12.240 --> 02:04:16.880]  you let your kids eat this or try this or the guard of solar whatever it's like fluoride is rat
[02:04:16.880 --> 02:04:22.240]  poison you know that's what they use on rats they put it in our water i know it's terrible or

[02:08:18.080 --> 02:08:31.600]  jones the death machine
[02:08:34.560 --> 02:08:41.440]  it's growing and the new world order is involved in a mega massive
[02:08:41.440 --> 02:08:49.600]  sci-op to divert us from the massive military actions and build up in the middle east our
[02:08:49.600 --> 02:08:56.800]  government hijacked by foreign banks looting us 85 billion a month in qe3 qe infinity uh putting
[02:08:56.800 --> 02:09:03.440]  al-qaeda in charge setting up secret police here in america journalists being persecuted journalists
[02:09:03.440 --> 02:09:09.120]  dying in a say being used on the people i mean just the crimes we ought to do a three hour show
[02:09:09.120 --> 02:09:13.520]  sometime where we all just talk about the bad things the government's done and the bad things
[02:09:13.520 --> 02:09:20.560]  criminal interests have done that's what our founders did for 15 years before 1775 1776 but
[02:09:20.560 --> 02:09:27.920]  it really started in 1775 they had committees of correspondence where they would list the real
[02:09:27.920 --> 02:09:32.000]  crimes of the government and it's important to do that because the government's always trying to
[02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:36.880]  demonize the people the patriots the liberty movement they try to demonize good cops that act
[02:09:36.880 --> 02:09:42.080]  like human beings they try to demonize people that try to bring folks together i i mean i i
[02:09:42.080 --> 02:09:48.880]  physically got nauseous last night and today reading people threatening to kill me all over
[02:09:48.880 --> 02:09:56.320]  youtube all over info wars go look at it the zemmerman family is getting massive death threats
[02:09:56.320 --> 02:10:02.480]  on record if you go to drugsreport.com and info wars.com as well as prism panta.com you'll get
[02:10:02.480 --> 02:10:12.160]  the widest spectrum but we there are so many instances of blacks but also with with whites
[02:10:13.120 --> 02:10:20.560]  mainly anarchist types beating up other white people and breaking into businesses and beating up
[02:10:21.440 --> 02:10:30.800]  news teams and attacking police and attacking police cars and looting walmarts and i've been
[02:10:30.800 --> 02:10:39.760]  looking at who it is it's it's 80 black 15 anarchist maybe 5 hispanic
[02:10:42.480 --> 02:10:46.000]  and i'm sure of la starts burning again it'll be a bunch of hispanics involved as well because
[02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:50.080]  that's the major population there people just you know use something like that the criminal
[02:10:50.080 --> 02:10:55.120]  element that's in all groups will use something like that but i mean if this doesn't get stopped
[02:10:55.120 --> 02:11:01.440]  real soon if the police i told i said this on saturday night when it happened i said it's
[02:11:01.440 --> 02:11:07.440]  sunday and i said it right through yesterday that i said on friday you're going to see
[02:11:09.280 --> 02:11:14.480]  zemmerman get off i think what he did was stupid follows me around with a gun i mean if i
[02:11:14.480 --> 02:11:19.920]  says somebody breaking in a car i'm going to call the cops just because it's a car it's not worth
[02:11:19.920 --> 02:11:25.040]  having to kill somebody i don't want to trouble quite frankly and i don't want to have a confrontation
[02:11:25.040 --> 02:11:31.600]  chances are they'll pull a gun now i'm in danger but if i saw somebody carjacking a car with a
[02:11:31.600 --> 02:11:37.440]  family in it i'll be honest with you folks i would like a gorilla i mean you know go go over
[02:11:37.440 --> 02:11:41.600]  the without even if i didn't have a weapon i would attack somebody i mean that's just how i am
[02:11:41.600 --> 02:11:46.880]  if i see innocence being attacked by people i will attack them and you can call that stupid
[02:11:46.880 --> 02:11:52.640]  i can't control myself but if it's somebody you know stealing your car or whatever it didn't
[02:11:52.640 --> 02:11:58.160]  worth killing them it didn't worth you dying even though legally and lawfully in most states you
[02:11:58.160 --> 02:12:02.560]  can kill somebody doing that that goes back to the old west where if you stole somebody's horse
[02:12:02.560 --> 02:12:07.680]  you might die so i could see how that was the death penalty to steal somebody's horse because
[02:12:08.240 --> 02:12:13.760]  you know the uh i mean a horse might be a year's wages and if somebody stole your horse i mean
[02:12:13.760 --> 02:12:17.280]  that you know they're trying to kill you you're going to be left out there in the middle of nowhere
[02:12:17.280 --> 02:12:24.720]  with wolves and coyotes and the natives and everything else but i gotta tell you i mean i've
[02:12:24.720 --> 02:12:32.320]  i've never seen anything like this um business even worse than how the media played up the whole
[02:12:32.320 --> 02:12:38.080]  rodney king thing i've never seen the media trying to create racial division like this
[02:12:38.080 --> 02:12:41.840]  and i have never received this many death threats i mean go down for worse dot com
[02:12:41.840 --> 02:12:46.640]  it is probably government provocateurs most of them but some of them are probably real
[02:12:47.200 --> 02:12:54.480]  uh putting really nasty stuff up there about black people and then there's black folks putting
[02:12:54.480 --> 02:13:02.160]  up nasty things about white people and then there's alex why are you posting this like like i'm
[02:13:02.160 --> 02:13:07.760]  doing it i mean this is what happens when you don't have censorship going on it is a free for all
[02:13:07.760 --> 02:13:13.040]  on info wars dot com but by the way i was looking on other big message boards it's a free for all
[02:13:13.040 --> 02:13:18.880]  everywhere i don't have the staff to have 20 people in there controlling all the stuff that's
[02:13:18.880 --> 02:13:22.400]  going on there by the way they're going to use stuff like this to censor the internet
[02:13:22.400 --> 02:13:27.760]  france has already passed laws to basically not allow message boards and arrest people that run
[02:13:27.760 --> 02:13:33.280]  message boards that allow anybody to say something racist i mean we're but then it's all going to be
[02:13:33.280 --> 02:13:39.200]  selectively enforced as well you've got all these black leaders of the new black panther party
[02:13:39.200 --> 02:13:45.840]  saying rioting is what's needed and now they're calling it protesting i love how alan dershowitz
[02:13:45.840 --> 02:13:54.480]  is um i love how just all these people are trying to stir this stuff up i'm sitting there looking
[02:13:54.480 --> 02:14:03.840]  at all these news headlines but it just goes on and on and on to watch this happening and then
[02:14:04.400 --> 02:14:09.520]  you get this whole gangster thing that the politically correct people don't know what to do
[02:14:09.520 --> 02:14:16.320]  where it's so popular in gangster culture to be really viciously anti homosexual and i don't
[02:14:16.320 --> 02:14:20.960]  mean saying hey it's a dangerous lifestyle hey you know don't push it on you know young people
[02:14:20.960 --> 02:14:31.520]  whatever i'm talking about you know saying hey uh george zimmerman you know deserve to get problems
[02:14:31.520 --> 02:14:36.640]  because he was a gay child molester and all this stuff that's the kind of stuff being said by
[02:14:39.280 --> 02:14:47.040]  the friends of trevon martin like jen tell warn zimmerman could be gay rapist i mean just just
[02:14:47.040 --> 02:14:53.040]  this type of bizarreness that's going on out there and then when it's these politically
[02:14:53.040 --> 02:15:00.000]  protected groups they're basically allowed to do stuff that nobody else can get away with
[02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:07.040]  i mean just like calling white people cracker heads cracker this is cracker that's i guarantee
[02:15:07.040 --> 02:15:15.120]  you folks if i was putting out the tweets and things that some black um celebrities are doing i
[02:15:15.120 --> 02:15:19.200]  would be arrested i mean there are people calling for his family to be killed calling for him to be
[02:15:19.200 --> 02:15:24.240]  killed and no one's getting in trouble because that's not free speech when you say we need to go kill
[02:15:24.240 --> 02:15:31.120]  somebody that's a call to action and i don't like the fact that they're setting up a politically
[02:15:31.120 --> 02:15:39.040]  correct system where whites are held up as the devil and then whites uh get nitpicked you know
[02:15:39.040 --> 02:15:45.520]  it's code words to say obama's from chicago no it means obama comes from a gangster government
[02:15:45.520 --> 02:15:50.640]  it doesn't mean anything to do with black people when you say chicago the crime capital people
[02:15:50.640 --> 02:15:56.800]  you know call rammanual the godfather that means mafia organized crime al capone
[02:15:58.800 --> 02:16:08.000]  valentine's day massacre so whites can't talk about chicago because that's racist code word
[02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:14.480]  but then you can call white people the equivalent of the n word all day long and it's supposedly
[02:16:14.480 --> 02:16:19.440]  okay because whites are inherently bad and and this is what the social engineers have set up
[02:16:19.440 --> 02:16:25.200]  to them racist is the way to control people i want to get your take on all this 800 259
[02:16:25.200 --> 02:16:34.560]  92 31 800 259 92 31 and remember all of us are being forced gmo vaccines kim trails
[02:16:34.560 --> 02:16:40.960]  weather modification open borders driving down wages fukushima radiation two years raining down
[02:16:40.960 --> 02:16:46.160]  on us our government uh 85 million a month the foreign banks were being raped at every level
[02:16:46.160 --> 02:16:52.640]  all of us are under attack it's not the one percent folks more than 80 of the world's wealth
[02:16:52.640 --> 02:16:56.960]  look it up are controlled by 6 000 superclass according to the head of the kissinger group
[02:16:56.960 --> 02:17:01.920]  and i agree with roth cops analysis and we did the math a few months ago on air of the amount of
[02:17:01.920 --> 02:17:08.480]  wealth they control 6 000 people if you divide it into seven plus billion it comes out to 00 it
[02:17:08.480 --> 02:17:20.960]  goes comes out to 0.000006 0s and then i think it was 26 or was it 23 it's not even it it's not
[02:17:20.960 --> 02:17:37.280]  even 99.999999999999999% of us it's 0.0000020026 or was it 23 we don't want to do that math again
[02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:43.200]  we did a whole math equation and showed graphics of this i mean this is insane we're all being
[02:17:43.200 --> 02:17:50.840]  hit with this, and I want humanity to succeed. I cannot get any black people, except my listeners
[02:17:50.840 --> 02:17:55.680]  that happen to be black, excited about the fact that 50 plus percent of blacks never
[02:17:55.680 --> 02:18:02.520]  get born, or that 63 percent of the abortions in Texas and 65 percent in Florida and other
[02:18:02.520 --> 02:18:09.040]  states are minorities. It's like, oh, shut up, crackerhead. You know, you know your
[02:18:09.040 --> 02:18:14.440]  racist, and it's just like, what? It's a eugenics operation. They're chemically murdering
[02:18:14.440 --> 02:18:21.320]  us, biologically murdering us. We're under a social grid to dumb us down. We're all in
[02:18:21.320 --> 02:18:25.720]  this together, and the globalists are taking a case that might be wrong, might be right,
[02:18:25.720 --> 02:18:31.600]  reasonable down, and making it, projecting it, on to all of us, like every white person's
[02:18:31.600 --> 02:18:37.320]  George Zimmerman, and every black person's Trayvon Martin, and now, let's, I mean, this
[02:18:37.320 --> 02:18:42.960]  is mind control, just like every gun owner killed the kids at Sandy Hook. They said gun
[02:18:42.960 --> 02:18:47.360]  owners, it's your fault. You heard that, and now they're saying gun owners, it's your
[02:18:47.360 --> 02:18:52.040]  fault, Trayvon died. I mean, don't you put that guilt on me? Don't you say I did that?
[02:18:52.040 --> 02:18:57.000]  I didn't kill those kids at Sandy Hook. I didn't go out there and shoot Trayvon Martin. How
[02:18:57.000 --> 02:19:01.920]  dare you get on my site and say you're going to kill me? You think I'm scared of that?
[02:19:01.920 --> 02:19:07.440]  I'm scared of the type of animal manipulation against different groups of human beings by
[02:19:07.440 --> 02:19:11.800]  the globalists to have us at each other's throats, and I'll tell you who I'm really scared
[02:19:11.800 --> 02:19:16.320]  for. If the disarmed minorities in these big cities ever think you're going to come to
[02:19:16.320 --> 02:19:20.960]  the suburbs, did you ever know it's your racist big liberal bosses that took your guns away
[02:19:20.960 --> 02:19:25.360]  so you could be free game to be killed? Did you know if you ever came out in the suburbs
[02:19:25.360 --> 02:19:29.680]  or the countryside to burn down the white people's houses, do you have any idea what
[02:19:29.680 --> 02:19:36.200]  would happen? It's not going to be white people that are going to be dying. You already had
[02:19:36.200 --> 02:19:42.080]  your guns taken by the Ku Klux Klan. That's why you don't have guns in New York and Chicago
[02:19:42.080 --> 02:19:50.240]  and L.A. and D.C. because they don't want black people having guns. You understand that?
[02:19:50.240 --> 02:19:55.400]  That's the racism right there. If you had guns, if the good people had guns, you wouldn't
[02:19:55.400 --> 02:20:01.880]  be getting fed on by your own people in your cities. That's a civil right.

[02:21:10.880 --> 02:21:15.000]  requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the
[02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:20.560]  president could obtain this world-class healer. Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are
[02:21:20.560 --> 02:21:25.080]  used around the world to keep people healthy. Now, you can protect yourself and your loved

[02:23:28.840 --> 02:23:33.000]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors
[02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:38.040]  won't talk about gold IRAs? They've been available since 1986 yet the financial industry won't
[02:23:38.040 --> 02:23:42.560]  recognize the value of gold for your retirement. Gold is outperformed paper investments yet
[02:23:42.560 --> 02:23:48.920]  no word about IRAs. If you would like to have gold for your retirement call 800-686-2237.
[02:23:48.920 --> 02:23:54.720]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation in low returns call 800-686-2237. Secure
[02:23:54.720 --> 02:24:14.200]  your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:24:14.200 --> 02:24:38.080]  Some folks, and when the band plays, they point the cannon, don't they? No, it ain't
[02:24:38.080 --> 02:24:54.560]  me. I'm not part of the 0-0-0-0-0-2-6 elite. I'm part of the 99.99999999999. 9%. It isn't
[02:24:54.560 --> 02:25:04.160]  the 1% that's the enemy. It's the crony globalist up top. Ooh, don't they help themselves? The
[02:25:04.160 --> 02:25:17.560]  corporate welfare in 85 billion a month for your tax money. That's right. That's right.
[02:25:17.560 --> 02:25:21.920]  And then you thought Obama was going to bring you a health care plan that the insurance companies
[02:25:21.920 --> 02:25:26.280]  and banks wrote and that it wasn't going to be a screw job? But people don't want to admit
[02:25:26.280 --> 02:25:32.640]  they've been conned and that's why poor people are poor is because they buy into propaganda.
[02:25:32.640 --> 02:25:37.960]  And it makes me sick and I'm watching everybody play it off against each other so Obama can
[02:25:37.960 --> 02:25:41.240]  act like the savior in the middle of it and he's going to fix everything. I want to go
[02:25:41.240 --> 02:25:45.420]  to your phone calls, but here's the breaking news and mfolwars.com. This is breaking at
[02:25:45.420 --> 02:25:52.200]  mfolwars.com. Zemerman family suspects Obama is tapping their phones. Oh, everybody's phones
[02:25:52.200 --> 02:25:57.320]  are tapped, but you better believe the Justice Department is running this whole show, folks,
[02:25:57.320 --> 02:26:02.320]  because they want a distraction. Look at MSNBC and the race baiting on there 24-7. Don't
[02:26:02.320 --> 02:26:07.400]  accept their entire agenda of tyranny. Well, you're a racist. Read the health care bill
[02:26:07.400 --> 02:26:12.520]  and know it's a scam. You're a racist. Want to be able to have folks armed in Chicago
[02:26:12.520 --> 02:26:17.200]  and New York and D.C. to protect themselves and drive down the crime rate? You're a racist.
[02:26:17.200 --> 02:26:21.320]  Want to arm black people? You're a racist. Don't want black people aborted in mass? You're
[02:26:21.320 --> 02:26:28.560]  a racist. You want to kill babies? Kill black babies all day long? Kill Hispanic babies?
[02:26:28.560 --> 02:26:35.940]  Kill white babies? Baby, you're a liberal and everybody's going to love you. Concerns
[02:26:35.940 --> 02:26:42.560]  over special interest groups pushing for federal hearing. That's right. Key article
[02:26:42.560 --> 02:26:49.280]  up on mfolwars.com. Trayvon protesters storm Walmart assault bystanders. We have that video.
[02:26:49.280 --> 02:26:54.400]  I mean, I can't even cover all this. This is just, I mean, there are so many attacks,
[02:26:54.400 --> 02:27:00.560]  beatings, shootings of whites right now with people saying, this is for Trayvon. Oh, yeah.
[02:27:00.560 --> 02:27:03.720]  And do you think that's going to make white people want to be your friend? You're like,
[02:27:03.720 --> 02:27:09.240]  I don't care. We're the royal black Israelite. And it's the end of the world for you, white
[02:27:09.240 --> 02:27:14.600]  devil. And then of course they use that the transatlantic slave trade because whites were
[02:27:14.600 --> 02:27:20.160]  slaves then too in most areas of Europe. They call them serfs. And it was the exact
[02:27:20.160 --> 02:27:24.000]  same thing. You got whipped, got beat, you know, all the same stuff. So they said, oh,
[02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:28.960]  black folks, we got the curse of ham and they twisted the Bible. So they're allowed to be
[02:27:28.960 --> 02:27:34.360]  slaves too. And then now the black Israelite movement picks up on that and goes, you're
[02:27:34.360 --> 02:27:39.440]  just a white devil because of your skin color. And it's nothing but what the Ku Klux Klan
[02:27:39.440 --> 02:27:44.240]  says that they're God's special people. And it's the exact same thing that all these other
[02:27:44.240 --> 02:27:50.920]  groups do saying, Hey, I'm in the ultimate club. I'm God and everybody else is a devil.
[02:27:50.920 --> 02:27:54.840]  The white groups say the blacks are the devil. The black groups say the whites are the devil.
[02:27:54.840 --> 02:27:59.120]  Meanwhile, the foreign offshore New World Order poisoning our food and water has made
[02:27:59.120 --> 02:28:02.400]  deals and they've got the black leaders. They got the white leaders. They got the Asian
[02:28:02.400 --> 02:28:07.480]  leaders. They got all the leaders or they kill them signed on to the New World Order
[02:28:07.480 --> 02:28:13.080]  so they can play God and rewrite the whole planet and take over. And then you're supposedly
[02:28:13.080 --> 02:28:19.040]  a racist if you expose all that. I'm going to go to break and I'm going to come back.
[02:28:19.040 --> 02:28:24.120]  We'll get Wayne Madsen on at about 40 after. So I want to hurry to some of your calls when
[02:28:24.120 --> 02:28:29.360]  we come back from break. In fact, let's go to a phone call right now. Let's go to Jay
[02:28:29.360 --> 02:28:36.960]  in New York City. Welcome, Jay. Hi, Alex. It's nice to finally get on your show. I'm
[02:28:36.960 --> 02:28:43.880]  good as a big admirer of alternate news websites because of their desire to search for the
[02:28:43.880 --> 02:28:49.280]  truth and facts. And so that part of your show I respect. And I do respect that you
[02:28:49.280 --> 02:28:56.800]  have the guts to go on publicly and say things that are unpopular. So I hope that right now
[02:28:56.800 --> 02:28:59.960]  while I'm on your show, you'll give me the opportunity to say something. Yeah, sure.
[02:28:59.960 --> 02:29:03.280]  Every time I cut a call or off and we go to break, they think it's censorship or breaks
[02:29:03.280 --> 02:29:06.840]  at 30 after. I may be able to hold you over, but just you don't need to do this. Listen,
[02:29:06.840 --> 02:29:11.640]  I got a pet peeve though. It's call screen stuff on air. Okay, you're on air. We didn't
[02:29:11.640 --> 02:29:16.480]  screen your call, did we? No, you didn't. So let me. So if you please them, let me quickly
[02:29:16.480 --> 02:29:20.720]  get up. Let's do a preface. Let's do it again. Go ahead. Okay. My point is this is that
[02:29:20.720 --> 02:29:25.560]  the and I'm a white Latino with somebody might say I have European ancestry and I have Mestizo
[02:29:25.560 --> 02:29:30.080]  ancestry. What I'd like to say is for the Trayvon Morgan case, how could anybody possibly
[02:29:30.080 --> 02:29:35.280]  believe that the man's claim that he had his head banged 25 times on cement? It's a truthful
[02:29:35.280 --> 02:29:40.800]  state. And how could anybody believe that there would be no blood on Zimmerman's clothes
[02:29:40.800 --> 02:29:44.280]  or on trade? I'm going to try to get exactly what you're saying. We come back. I'll come
[02:29:44.280 --> 02:29:50.720]  back to you. You can make your point. We'll be right back. Stay with us. We're on the
[02:29:50.720 --> 02:30:02.360]  March, the empires on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. Now is the perfect

[02:33:31.080 --> 02:33:35.040]  Listen, I'm not mad at Jay. I love everybody out there. You've heard me blow up about this
[02:33:35.040 --> 02:33:41.560]  before. So many callers, though, go. I want to talk about this. Go. You know, you're on
[02:33:41.560 --> 02:33:48.200]  the air. And or they'll say I'm a big fan, but I disagree with you. That's fine. Listen,
[02:33:48.200 --> 02:33:54.440]  I'm a big boy. Okay, so just let me have it. Jay, get to the heart of what you're saying.
[02:33:54.440 --> 02:34:00.280]  Okay, Alex. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. The blood, when Zimmerman spoke to detectives
[02:34:00.280 --> 02:34:04.640]  on the tape, you can see that he said he had blood all over his face and his eyes. Yet
[02:34:04.640 --> 02:34:11.040]  there was no DNA evidence on Zimmerman, excuse me, on Trayvon Martin of any of Zimmerman's
[02:34:11.040 --> 02:34:17.400]  blood, nothing whatsoever. Somebody asserting that they had their head slammed in a concrete
[02:34:17.400 --> 02:34:21.760]  25 times. It's impossible to have your head slammed in a concrete 25 times and not have
[02:34:21.760 --> 02:34:26.600]  a concussion be passed out and then not want an x-ray. How could people believe evidence
[02:34:26.600 --> 02:34:29.360]  of photographs without an x-ray to back up the dog?
[02:34:29.360 --> 02:34:34.960]  I know, but do you understand that I'm only covering this to describe how it's a giant
[02:34:34.960 --> 02:34:42.520]  diversion? I mean, they've known for a long time, going back to the Limburg baby case and
[02:34:42.520 --> 02:34:47.760]  stuff, that they can take a court case and drag it out for years and get everybody diverted
[02:34:47.760 --> 02:34:54.360]  onto that instead of all the incredible things that are going on right now. And you give
[02:34:54.360 --> 02:34:58.240]  that evidence. I didn't follow the trial like some people did. I followed it some. And so
[02:34:58.240 --> 02:35:02.280]  you're just stating this is what happened and this is what went on. The witnesses and
[02:35:02.280 --> 02:35:06.160]  there's multiple witnesses that he was bouncing his head in the concrete. It creates reasonable
[02:35:06.160 --> 02:35:14.080]  talent. I saw a comment here where Trayvon Martin's girlfriend says, this is up on infowarch.com,
[02:35:14.080 --> 02:35:18.640]  that the Sixth Amendment or the right to jury and due process and to face your accuser is
[02:35:18.640 --> 02:35:24.520]  old school and we should just go directly to the government doing whatever it wants.
[02:35:24.520 --> 02:35:30.480]  I mean, the government, the number one killer in history will just let it be imperial. This
[02:35:30.480 --> 02:35:37.760]  is a jury. It's our system. None of it's perfect. What do we do? I mean, I'm now covering,
[02:35:37.760 --> 02:35:41.800]  see no one's going to cover the white people being killed and being shot and being attacked
[02:35:41.800 --> 02:35:47.840]  all over this country because they're of the devil. See, nobody cares about that though.
[02:35:47.840 --> 02:35:52.000]  And that's the plan here is to create this division. Do you understand that angle?
[02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:57.080]  I do understand that. And I mean, I totally discourage any of my fellow countrymen that
[02:35:57.080 --> 02:36:01.840]  are on minority committee, any violence, I do not advocate violence. There is a God
[02:36:01.840 --> 02:36:05.040]  and if the truth is going to come out, the real violence buddy is fluoride and kids water
[02:36:05.040 --> 02:36:11.280]  every day. I appreciate your call. I just, everyone just loves to get into whatever the
[02:36:11.280 --> 02:36:16.520]  big thing is and they just put out here's the big thing and everybody then all these
[02:36:16.520 --> 02:36:21.360]  ignorant people. I'm not saying you're ignorant, sir, but other people, some of the statements
[02:36:21.360 --> 02:36:24.520]  we're seeing are very ignorant going out saying, I'm going to kill Alex Jones or I'm going
[02:36:24.520 --> 02:36:28.120]  to kill the Zimmerman's or I'm going to, I'm going to kill a cracker. And it's like, oh,
[02:36:28.120 --> 02:36:34.640]  how cute and MSNBC is like, well, crackers have it coming. And it's the ruling class,
[02:36:34.640 --> 02:36:39.880]  mainly white people on MSNBC, stirring it all up. Let me tell you, these folks are racist
[02:36:39.880 --> 02:36:45.000]  people. They sit back and look at their racist against humanity. They think we're all a bunch
[02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:50.160]  of done animals. They're playing us off against each other. And, and they write books saying
[02:36:50.160 --> 02:36:55.600]  we are and we deserve it by the mere fact that stuff works on us. But I refuse as somebody
[02:36:55.600 --> 02:37:01.480]  that knows all this stuff to use it against people. I refuse. We're getting Wayne Mabston
[02:37:01.480 --> 02:37:04.720]  on the line in a minute. Let's go to a couple more calls while we're getting him. Ernest
[02:37:04.720 --> 02:37:11.280]  in Washington, you're on the air. Go ahead. Hey, Alex, boy, I can just feel the emotion
[02:37:11.280 --> 02:37:16.360]  coming right through the speaker. Wow. It's insane. Man, I'm getting sick of it. That's
[02:37:16.360 --> 02:37:21.360]  what I'm telling you. I'm getting sick of it. Woo. Let's party on them. Grave on Martin
[02:37:21.360 --> 02:37:26.520]  party. Woo. Anyway, the reason I called is this big distraction that took everything
[02:37:26.520 --> 02:37:32.120]  right off of Michael Hastings. Uh, and right off IRS gate and right off the NSA and right
[02:37:32.120 --> 02:37:37.160]  off everything. Exactly. Michael Jackson considerably. I got, but who cares? Let's
[02:37:37.160 --> 02:37:43.480]  kill crackers. Yeah. Woo. That'll fix it. Yeah. So anyway, the reason I was calling
[02:37:43.480 --> 02:37:48.600]  is, is that they pulled the same distraction with the Boston marathon bombing. Uh, nobody
[02:37:48.600 --> 02:37:53.760]  heard about the blanket warrant that the DA issued to every single medical marijuana patient
[02:37:53.760 --> 02:37:59.320]  in Oregon on the Friday before the bombing. Uh, it's never touched the light of day. And
[02:37:59.320 --> 02:38:04.080]  if you look at Obama triple the number of anti marijuana raids, look it up, but it's okay
[02:38:04.080 --> 02:38:08.160]  because he said he's going to let us have the weed. He's going to give me free healthcare.
[02:38:08.160 --> 02:38:12.480]  It actually increases the price for poor people, but it doesn't matter. He said he liked me
[02:38:12.480 --> 02:38:19.480]  and he in the cracker. So anyway, the Michael Hastings story here you have now. I know your
[02:38:19.480 --> 02:38:24.320]  premises is of course that nine 11 was an inside job. And if you take that premise from
[02:38:24.320 --> 02:38:29.080]  the beginning and you have a journalist who declares outright war on the United States
[02:38:29.080 --> 02:38:35.200]  government and then a few what days later or whatever his car explodes. I invite people
[02:38:35.200 --> 02:38:39.120]  to watch the movie, the beginning of the movie called the gatekeepers. It's by, it's
[02:38:39.120 --> 02:38:45.200]  about the sin bet, uh, Israeli anti terrorist organization that the government has. And
[02:38:45.200 --> 02:38:50.400]  then the beginning of the movie, they show a car driving through a neighborhood followed
[02:38:50.400 --> 02:38:54.920]  by a drone. And sure enough, boom, big explosion and the car comes rolling.
[02:38:54.920 --> 02:38:58.840]  Yeah, sure. I don't think a drone did it because that would be too obvious. And the way the
[02:38:58.840 --> 02:39:04.400]  car blew up and the engine out the back looks like a bomb inside the car or under the car.
[02:39:04.400 --> 02:39:10.960]  No, I was telling you what, he declared war and they droned him. Well, he was smart.
[02:39:10.960 --> 02:39:17.080]  He was smart, good looking, had had huge following on the left and right and had bombshell info
[02:39:17.080 --> 02:39:20.280]  and they killed him better than a hammer. Absolutely. And we're going to send reporters
[02:39:20.280 --> 02:39:24.360]  there to investigate it because I'm not going to live on my knees to a bunch of potbellied
[02:39:24.360 --> 02:39:29.360]  new world order people because I'm a racist. I appreciate your call. Um, you know, that's
[02:39:29.360 --> 02:39:34.280]  why I'm exposing, uh, you know, special hit teams. Is he, uh, it's all the distraction
[02:39:34.280 --> 02:39:41.000]  from that. I hear you. It's amazing. I'm going to go back, uh, to James and, uh, other people
[02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:46.800]  that are holding like Matthew and Anthony and Tom, uh, and others. Anthony wants to
[02:39:46.800 --> 02:39:50.400]  talk about we are change F behind intimidation. We'll see what that's like coming up when
[02:39:50.400 --> 02:39:54.080]  we get to him. But I wanted to get Wayne Madsen just to briefly pop in. He was here last
[02:39:54.080 --> 02:39:58.640]  week. Great guy. His info just keeps turning out to be so impeccable in the 15 years or
[02:39:58.640 --> 02:40:02.920]  so that I've been interviewing, uh, Wayne Madsen, uh, but he's one of the original
[02:40:02.920 --> 02:40:08.440]  big NSA whistleblowers. He worked there and I wanted to get his take on homeland security
[02:40:08.440 --> 02:40:14.680]  investigations. That's like a Praetorian guard over the other homeland security departments.
[02:40:14.680 --> 02:40:19.200]  They tell them what drug shipments to stop, what to let in, what human smuggling to let,
[02:40:19.200 --> 02:40:24.840]  which the globalists run. I mean, that's why they're the key gatekeepers, speaking of gatekeepers.
[02:40:24.840 --> 02:40:28.760]  And that's always where they have the key ops. And I'm not saying they killed Hastings,
[02:40:28.760 --> 02:40:34.240]  but that's from the reporters, uh, that, uh, that, uh, his buddies, Staff Sergeant Biggs
[02:40:34.240 --> 02:40:38.760]  is talking to. They were investigating. They got threatened by them and they say it's the
[02:40:38.760 --> 02:40:43.520]  same people that that's the feds that we're visiting people. According to these investigative
[02:40:43.520 --> 02:40:47.600]  journalists. And again, we have the names. We have the info. We're going to be, uh, you
[02:40:47.600 --> 02:40:51.080]  know, on these reporters, we're going to be interviewing a bunch of them, including TV
[02:40:51.080 --> 02:40:56.120]  station reporters, when we're out in Los Angeles to try to put this info out. And so, you know,
[02:40:56.120 --> 02:41:00.400]  if they kill me this week, I mean, they, they might want to send a message and do it. Just
[02:41:00.400 --> 02:41:05.920]  no, I'm not stupid. And I know that I'm okay. I go willingly up against the dragon because
[02:41:05.920 --> 02:41:09.240]  I'm not going to submit to it. Uh, and all of its evil. I mean, they're giving kids
[02:41:09.240 --> 02:41:13.880]  garter sell shots. They know, give them basically cancer. And that's if you're lucky, you get
[02:41:13.880 --> 02:41:18.120]  cancer in 20 years. A lot of them get cancer in a few weeks or have autoimmune or blood
[02:41:18.120 --> 02:41:22.560]  pour out of every orifice. I mean, that, I mean, that's why I just am going 110% here
[02:41:22.560 --> 02:41:26.560]  because we're already under genetic warfare. We're already under biological warfare. We're
[02:41:26.560 --> 02:41:31.000]  already under soft kill warfare. So I wanted to bring up, he talked about the Q group that's
[02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:35.240]  now been confirmed and the undersea cable tapping and that all the European countries
[02:41:35.240 --> 02:41:40.640]  involved in it. He, he exposed it in their commission a decade ago or more. So, so what,
[02:41:40.640 --> 02:41:44.600]  what Madsen's covered has been confirmed just, just to give you that preface, but I wanted
[02:41:44.600 --> 02:41:49.800]  to bring up the homeland security investigations group. This is the Praetorian guard assigned
[02:41:49.800 --> 02:41:55.480]  with an ice, but that's just, just the agency that funds it. Uh, and the, uh, the fact that
[02:41:55.480 --> 02:42:02.360]  we're tunneling into this and I wanted to, uh, invite Wayne Madsen, it just clicked.
[02:42:02.360 --> 02:42:06.880]  That's why I called to get him on. I would like to invite Wayne Madsen to fly him with
[02:42:06.880 --> 02:42:11.920]  one of my camera people out to be an advisor. This Madsen, I've been with him. He knows
[02:42:11.920 --> 02:42:15.360]  how to pick up military operatives and stuff that have been put on us before. I don't want
[02:42:15.360 --> 02:42:18.760]  to get into the whole story. People that haven't lived this don't know, but we can't eat dinner
[02:42:18.760 --> 02:42:22.880]  without the stuff going on. And so Madsen, how would you like to go with Staff Sergeant
[02:42:22.880 --> 02:42:28.520]  Biggs, uh, as an old school hand of the world and one of my camera people to Los Angeles
[02:42:28.520 --> 02:42:32.000]  next week on Monday and Tuesday? How would you like to do that?
[02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:37.640]  Well, just in February, I was out in California investigating the, uh, what I consider the
[02:42:37.640 --> 02:42:44.400]  hit on Phil Marshall, 9-11 author, Phil Marshall, and his two kids and his pet dog. So, uh, yeah,
[02:42:44.400 --> 02:42:50.040]  you know, I mean, uh, California seems to be the place to go to investigate, uh, suspicious
[02:42:50.040 --> 02:42:55.360]  deaths of journalists and authors. After all, that's where Gary Webb, uh, a few years back,
[02:42:55.360 --> 02:43:00.240]  uh, he supposedly died as a result of two gunshot wounds. So yeah, you know, California,
[02:43:00.240 --> 02:43:05.160]  I guess is the place for investigation. Yeah. Well, if I was going into Fallujah, uh, I'd
[02:43:05.160 --> 02:43:08.400]  want to have Sergeant Biggs with me. He's a great guy. He's a great distinguished record.
[02:43:08.400 --> 02:43:12.040]  He's really a war hero. Uh, the wars are corrupt. He knows that as well, but he still
[02:43:12.040 --> 02:43:17.160]  had a lot of courage and is a good guy. Um, I'm going to send a camp. One of my best
[02:43:17.160 --> 02:43:22.080]  camera people, I'm trying to fit it, work on Obama deception too. I don't even have
[02:43:22.080 --> 02:43:27.560]  the crew to really send two people, but I think Biggs needs the expert at, at, at clandestine
[02:43:27.560 --> 02:43:31.400]  stuff, not that we're clandestine. They're going to have clandestine people out there
[02:43:31.400 --> 02:43:36.840]  and you've got the, uh, you've got the big wavos there, the big brass wavos. Uh, I'm
[02:43:36.840 --> 02:43:41.120]  happy to go too. I mean, actually I'd fall asleep, you know, on a space drop or something
[02:43:41.120 --> 02:43:46.040]  like that. Aliens. I do this stuff so much, but, uh, the whole point is, is that, uh,
[02:43:46.040 --> 02:43:50.040]  I want to send you or just brainstorming here on air and I'm not sure which reporter
[02:43:50.040 --> 02:43:55.520]  yet they all want to go. Um, and so, uh, let's work all this out cause I'm brainstorming
[02:43:55.520 --> 02:44:00.760]  on air. Do get with Madsen after the show. Do tends to organize all this as the news
[02:44:00.760 --> 02:44:05.800]  director and let's get Madsen flowing out there. Let's get our base of operations and
[02:44:05.800 --> 02:44:09.880]  then let's fly out Sunday or Monday. I'm, well, we'll decide later. Let's get Biggs
[02:44:09.880 --> 02:44:15.320]  out from, uh, Charlotte's, North Carolina. Is it South Carolina? I forget. I have one
[02:44:15.320 --> 02:44:20.440]  of those moments, too much going on and we'll fly them all out and have a meet out there
[02:44:20.440 --> 02:44:27.200]  in Los Angeles, um, for two days to go because I'm worried they'll put operatives on him
[02:44:27.200 --> 02:44:31.320]  just to rabbit trailing and pushing him off. We want to go through the real investigative
[02:44:31.320 --> 02:44:35.680]  journalists we know, the local TV station, the eyewitnesses we know by name who are ready
[02:44:35.680 --> 02:44:39.560]  to talk to us. So it's going to be a lot of work. Are you ready to bird dog this whole
[02:44:39.560 --> 02:44:45.600]  thing and help, help honcho this Madsen? Absolutely. I've found out that you can't really get to
[02:44:45.600 --> 02:44:51.080]  the essence of a story unless you're actually physically there. You got to look at the scene
[02:44:51.080 --> 02:44:56.720]  of the crime for one thing. Uh, television can play tricks when you see things on television.
[02:44:56.720 --> 02:45:00.960]  So when you're there looking at it and you're talking to eyewitnesses, we had, you know,
[02:45:00.960 --> 02:45:04.160]  several people in that neighborhood talking about how they heard, what they heard was
[02:45:04.160 --> 02:45:09.400]  like a bomb going off. These are, these of course are people, uh, they're very key that
[02:45:09.400 --> 02:45:14.800]  tell you exactly what happened. Just like Phil Marshall's neighbors were very helpful
[02:45:14.800 --> 02:45:19.960]  in determining that, uh, there was no way he shot him, uh, his kids and himself, you
[02:45:19.960 --> 02:45:24.280]  know, he talked to the people that live there. They know best what, what has happened.
[02:45:24.280 --> 02:45:27.840]  Yeah. Well, I just want you there. I mean, bigs can take care of himself. He's got courage
[02:45:27.840 --> 02:45:32.280]  and he's smart, but, uh, I want him to know what tricks to look for because he's dealt
[02:45:32.280 --> 02:45:36.600]  with a whole different atmosphere being in, uh, I don't know, three years in Iraq, two
[02:45:36.600 --> 02:45:41.480]  years in Afghanistan, but we'll, uh, we'll get you out there by Monday then. And that's
[02:45:41.480 --> 02:45:45.360]  the plan. Okay. Just briefly, this is just a quick pop into day. What is your whole
[02:45:45.360 --> 02:45:54.000]  take on, uh, Homeland security investigations, uh, as entering the quadrant of suspects and
[02:45:54.000 --> 02:46:00.240]  what is your take, uh, then, uh, on the whole Trayvon Martin, uh, Siop, we see going on.
[02:46:00.240 --> 02:46:05.280]  Well, on, on this, uh, Homeland security, you, you, you know, after nine 11, and I,
[02:46:05.280 --> 02:46:10.880]  I wrote about what happened in NSA, we had the, uh, buildup of the NSA internal security
[02:46:10.880 --> 02:46:16.760]  group Q group, uh, which is now like an intelligence agency with, within an intelligence agency.
[02:46:16.760 --> 02:46:21.360]  It was, it was predicted that when Homeland security was organized as a department, that
[02:46:21.360 --> 02:46:29.240]  this thing was going to become a huge monolithic organization. And it has not only combined
[02:46:29.240 --> 02:46:35.160]  previous law enforcement agencies, but as you have said, it's created some of its own
[02:46:35.160 --> 02:46:41.920]  Homeland security internal, uh, investigations. Uh, this is, this is, is just a monster that's
[02:46:41.920 --> 02:46:46.960]  feeding on itself. And until we get rid of Homeland security and take it back to the
[02:46:46.960 --> 02:46:51.920]  status quo ante, we're going to see this, uh, type of thing continue with this, these
[02:46:51.920 --> 02:46:58.600]  out of control, uh, unanswerable, uh, intelligence and law enforcement agencies.
[02:46:58.600 --> 02:47:02.800]  Absolutely. Uh, continuing, very exciting. We're going to have you reporting from the
[02:47:02.800 --> 02:47:08.040]  ground with us, uh, with, uh, Staff Sergeant Joseph Biggs next week with one of our reporters,
[02:47:08.040 --> 02:47:11.080]  Wayne Madsen, working directly with Info Wars. That's why he was kind of out here. We're
[02:47:11.080 --> 02:47:14.920]  talking about having him work more with us because the great work he does, uh, in closing
[02:47:14.920 --> 02:47:17.400]  in the four or five minutes we've got left before I go to break and come back with calls
[02:47:17.400 --> 02:47:21.880]  and then Ted Nugent in the fourth hour of overdrive. What is your take on the whole
[02:47:21.880 --> 02:47:30.960]  spectacle now of the media and the just department trying to orchestrate or again, hauncho to
[02:47:30.960 --> 02:47:35.800]  use that word, uh, some type of summer of rage. And I guess it's working pretty good.
[02:47:35.800 --> 02:47:37.760]  We're not hearing about any of the scandals anymore.
[02:47:37.760 --> 02:47:44.360]  Right. You know, the worst network is MSNBC. You brought them up earlier. They have a one
[02:47:44.360 --> 02:47:50.400]  person on there, Melissa Harris Perry, who actually, uh, did a video. She had a, had
[02:47:50.400 --> 02:47:55.640]  an appearance, uh, on a recent program where she said, you know, Snowden should just come
[02:47:55.640 --> 02:48:00.080]  back and go to jail. Obama will take care of him in a federal prison. He won't have
[02:48:00.080 --> 02:48:04.920]  anything to worry about. Like, uh, hey, what about his trial? She wants him in prison already.
[02:48:04.920 --> 02:48:12.280]  Uh, yet she was, uh, basically goading people on about the whole Trayvon Martin situation.
[02:48:12.280 --> 02:48:18.360]  I mean, between her and people like Al Sharpton and MSNBC, these are trouble. These Al Sharpton
[02:48:18.360 --> 02:48:24.200]  is a professional troublemaker. I remember back when he, what he did up in, in, uh, Queens
[02:48:24.200 --> 02:48:29.280]  and, and Brooklyn urging people to attack Korean grocery store owners because they were
[02:48:29.280 --> 02:48:33.200]  charging, he thought they were charging too much when in fact they were the only ones
[02:48:33.200 --> 02:48:39.320]  who would go in and open stores in neighborhoods that were very dangerous. Uh, he has been
[02:48:39.320 --> 02:48:46.320]  a, uh, basically a race fader for decades and now he has his own show on MSNBC. Remember
[02:48:46.320 --> 02:48:55.320]  MSNBC owned by Comcast and Microsoft, uh, and Microsoft is key. So, so we had this, uh,
[02:48:55.320 --> 02:49:01.720]  person, uh, uh, saying Snowden, uh, should be in prison in the United States and, uh,
[02:49:01.720 --> 02:49:06.280]  Zimmerman should have gone to jail and that the, you know, jurors should be ashamed of
[02:49:06.280 --> 02:49:11.240]  themselves. I think what's really dangerous here is we're seeing now this, uh, that being
[02:49:11.240 --> 02:49:16.160]  shifted over to the jurors. You know, that's jury selection. You know, most people don't
[02:49:16.160 --> 02:49:20.400]  want to be on juries for this very reason. That's right. We're being taught that all
[02:49:20.400 --> 02:49:25.720]  of our institutions aren't good. The Justice Department, though, they're going to get that,
[02:49:25.720 --> 02:49:30.840]  that racist, uh, Zimmerman. I mean, I expect them to start saying black people are white
[02:49:30.840 --> 02:49:36.080]  when they kill black people just to make it racial. Right. Zimmerman, you're right. You
[02:49:36.080 --> 02:49:41.040]  are right, too. That this should have been a local central Florida story at the very
[02:49:41.040 --> 02:49:46.440]  maximum, the central Florida story. But what the media does with these, uh, these stories
[02:49:46.440 --> 02:49:51.880]  is that they make these local stories, national stories. And, and we had all the, you know,
[02:49:51.880 --> 02:49:59.720]  the Jesse Jackson's on and just to stir people's, uh, you know, uh, feelings up. And, and this
[02:49:59.720 --> 02:50:06.320]  is not healthy, uh, for this country. As you say, when we have major other major stories
[02:50:06.320 --> 02:50:12.760]  to cover, you know, we had, you know, here we have another OJ case, another, uh, Casey
[02:50:12.760 --> 02:50:17.200]  Anthony case. They always take these cases and make them national. This would have, this
[02:50:17.200 --> 02:50:24.240]  did not happen, by the way, in the news media back in the, uh, sixties and even the seventies.
[02:50:24.240 --> 02:50:30.000]  It was, um, you know, it was when we got the tabloid television, the 24 hour news channels
[02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:35.720]  absolutely closing. The Zimmerman family suspects Obama is tapping their phones. I don't think
[02:50:35.720 --> 02:50:37.920]  there's any suspects about it. Wayne, what do you say briefly?
[02:50:37.920 --> 02:50:43.120]  Why should they be different than the rest of us? Of course, the government's tapping
[02:50:43.120 --> 02:50:48.600]  all of our phones. Uh, we know that from the Snowden revelation. They tap us. It's security.
[02:50:48.600 --> 02:50:52.800]  We tapped them. It's espionage, but really all it is is a felony when they do it. Wayne

[02:52:13.520 --> 02:52:17.000]  the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing

[02:54:09.240 --> 02:54:22.080]  Waging war. All right, folks. Some stations carry it. But some don't. Everybody can find
[02:54:22.080 --> 02:54:28.840]  the audio and video links free and live at infowars.com forward slash show. In about
[02:54:28.840 --> 02:54:33.440]  T minus six minutes, we'll kick off the fourth hour of overdrive. I'll take a few calls and
[02:54:33.440 --> 02:54:37.400]  then Ted Nugent is going to be joining us with his take on this whole situation. He
[02:54:37.400 --> 02:54:43.160]  says it's a triumph and DrudgeReport.com is linked to it. That the Zimmerman verdict
[02:54:43.160 --> 02:54:48.400]  vindicates citizen patrols self defense. That's at rare.us where we've got the story up at
[02:54:48.400 --> 02:54:54.760]  infowars.com as well. So Ted Nugent is going to be joining us on that and this new call
[02:54:54.760 --> 02:54:58.880]  to collectively blame gun owners for what happened. Just like they tried to blame gun
[02:54:58.880 --> 02:55:04.000]  owners with Sandy Hook. That makes me really mad. Like gun owners are racist and gun owners
[02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:09.960]  killed the kids at Sandy Hook. It's all your fault, gun owners. Before I go any further,
[02:55:09.960 --> 02:55:13.680]  remember we're going to be premiering tomorrow night with the filmmakers here in town on
[02:55:13.680 --> 02:55:19.200]  info wars nightly news. State of mind, the psychology of control. And we started shipping
[02:55:19.200 --> 02:55:26.000]  the film yesterday to everyone on DVD and on Blu-ray. All orders now shipping from the
[02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:31.040]  info wars command center here in Austin, Texas. So if you haven't got your order in, it's
[02:55:31.040 --> 02:55:35.880]  a powerful film getting into the globalist manipulation of the psyche. It's great to
[02:55:35.880 --> 02:55:40.240]  wake up friends and family and your purchase. Believe me, I wish I could just have some
[02:55:40.240 --> 02:55:43.760]  great globalist benefactor that wanted to end the new world order who would just give me
[02:55:43.760 --> 02:55:48.400]  money. And then I wouldn't even have ads. In fact, I've skipped nine minutes of ads
[02:55:48.400 --> 02:55:52.400]  today that it might bankrupt the network. I've got to quit doing that folks. And that's
[02:55:52.400 --> 02:55:55.760]  how horrible I am. And when it comes to not wanting to make money, I don't even care about
[02:55:55.760 --> 02:55:59.680]  the money. It's not bad to want money, but I needed to find the operation by the t-shirts,
[02:55:59.680 --> 02:56:05.760]  by the books, by the procure, 10% off promo code water, purchase and shop with infowarstore.com.

[02:56:40.160 --> 02:56:44.960]  a sponsor. Get in the game, folks. We're deep into this. We got a chance. They wouldn't
[02:56:44.960 --> 02:56:49.280]  be coming after people and reporters if we didn't have power. So I'm committed. I am
[02:56:49.280 --> 02:56:55.800]  fighting, but I need you to buy the war bonds, folks, to put us in the field. We're all in.
[02:56:55.800 --> 02:57:00.200]  We're into turbo acceleration against the enemy, spending more than we're bringing in, exhausting
[02:57:00.200 --> 02:57:04.000]  backup funds. I'm like, you know what? I don't even need backup funds anymore. Full power.
[02:57:04.000 --> 02:57:08.640]  Yeah, just like just, we're going at them. We're going at them here. I swore to do it
[02:57:08.640 --> 02:57:16.760]  and we're doing it. We're committed. We need you to commit behind us right now. We're constitutionalist.
[02:57:16.760 --> 02:57:21.320]  I simply look at things and think, what is justice? What is right? What is historical
[02:57:21.320 --> 02:57:27.440]  common sense? And I try to just tell the truth. I try to be a good person and try to be honorable
[02:57:27.440 --> 02:57:32.960]  and try to have courage and try to decipher the globalist propaganda and what they're
[02:57:32.960 --> 02:57:39.920]  doing. That's all I can do. And I need you to see yourselves as leaders. Look, I mean,
[02:57:39.920 --> 02:57:43.480]  I wish we could get people to protest all over the country about no labeling on GMO. We've
[02:57:43.480 --> 02:57:46.640]  actually gotten that, but the media wouldn't cover it. I wish we could get people in every
[02:57:46.640 --> 02:57:51.000]  city mad. I don't call for violence, but when people are being violent to you, you can have
[02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:55.800]  self-defense. I mean, what if we saw people knocking out city windows over them, Florida
[02:57:55.800 --> 02:57:59.600]  and water assaulting our families? What if we saw people like the French burning down
[02:57:59.600 --> 02:58:03.960]  GMO crops? I'm not saying do that and get out of hand and stuff. My point is, I mean,
[02:58:03.960 --> 02:58:10.040]  I'd be like, well, it's self-defense. But if some Hispanic slash white guy in a questionable
[02:58:10.040 --> 02:58:17.880]  situation shoots a black guy and then it becomes this big media thing to divide us, I mean,
[02:58:17.880 --> 02:58:21.800]  you don't just go out and kill white people. By the way, whites are going to get even more
[02:58:21.800 --> 02:58:25.440]  paranoid now hearing that they're going to be killed and you may get more innocent black
[02:58:25.440 --> 02:58:33.000]  people shot. I mean, have you thought about that? I mean, white people see all this anti-white
[02:58:33.000 --> 02:58:37.720]  racism, folks, and they get paranoid. They're not racist. They don't dislike you. They're
[02:58:37.720 --> 02:58:43.920]  scared. Well, they're right back. Infowars.com for slash show for the free video and audio

[02:59:52.240 --> 03:00:20.680]  Post it coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:20.680 --> 03:00:40.640]  Again, if you've got a DrudgeReport.com, you can see a red link there. Zimmerman family
[03:00:40.640 --> 03:00:46.320]  suspects Obama is tapping their phones. That's very important. Ted Nugent's coming up. Right
[03:00:46.320 --> 03:00:51.320]  now let's go to James in Mississippi. You're on the air. Thanks for holding James. Hey
[03:00:51.320 --> 03:00:55.960]  Alex, how you doing today? I'm telling you, I'm just sick and tired of everybody's ignorance
[03:00:55.960 --> 03:01:00.200]  and I just want to try to empower humanity and I'm watching the globalist play everybody
[03:01:00.200 --> 03:01:05.200]  like a fiddle and it makes me sick. Well, what's been making me real sick lately is
[03:01:05.200 --> 03:01:10.400]  I cannot stand turning on the TV and see the politics that are playing behind the whole
[03:01:10.400 --> 03:01:17.120]  Trayvon Martin, George Zimmerman. You get Eric, the Attorney General Eric Holder gets
[03:01:17.120 --> 03:01:22.040]  out there and just completely politicizes every bit of it. If we can't get it in classic
[03:01:22.040 --> 03:01:26.520]  fashion for Eric Holder, if we can't get them in this court, let's just move to another
[03:01:26.520 --> 03:01:28.840]  one. Exactly. And it's bigger than Trayvon Martin
[03:01:28.840 --> 03:01:33.120]  and George Zimmerman. It's that we're being played. Yeah, they're using real people to
[03:01:33.120 --> 03:01:37.840]  create the fake debate. And yeah, there may have been injustice here. But the point is
[03:01:37.840 --> 03:01:45.400]  they are playing us. The Justice Department went and primed the pump on record and started
[03:01:45.400 --> 03:01:51.120]  the demonstrations. The Justice Department is usually trying to outlaw demonstrations.
[03:01:51.120 --> 03:01:58.080]  They want this to distract so they can play the part of the referee. Absolutely. And let
[03:01:58.080 --> 03:02:02.200]  me tell you the way this country is going. I'm from Mississippi and I was born and raised
[03:02:02.200 --> 03:02:07.520]  in Jackson, Mississippi. And I am a white male, 22 years old, and I am the minority.
[03:02:07.520 --> 03:02:12.840]  And I have dealt with racism my whole life, not reverse racism, racism. But that's okay
[03:02:12.840 --> 03:02:17.800]  because you deserve it. Oh yeah, I do. That'd be like if some black person's great-grandpa
[03:02:17.800 --> 03:02:22.000]  was a murderer, so you go to jail for it. I mean, just because white people have done
[03:02:22.000 --> 03:02:26.240]  some stuff that's wrong, I've not done anything and I'm sick of hearing about it. But again,
[03:02:26.240 --> 03:02:32.120]  it's the globalists trying to change the subject. Absolutely. But my biggest problem
[03:02:32.120 --> 03:02:35.200]  is maybe I'm not eating enough GMOs or drinking enough fluoride.
[03:02:35.200 --> 03:02:39.360]  Well, this is how racism works. People are racist to you because of your race, whether
[03:02:39.360 --> 03:02:43.200]  you're black, white, whatever it is. And then you start becoming racist towards them and
[03:02:43.200 --> 03:02:47.840]  start judging everybody. It's kind of like if a pit bull bit you, you're going to start
[03:02:47.840 --> 03:02:51.240]  thinking all pit bulls are going to bite you, even though most pit bulls actually aren't
[03:02:51.240 --> 03:02:56.800]  mean. And so if there are racist whites, blacks start thinking all the whites are racist.
[03:02:56.800 --> 03:03:01.960]  If there are racist blacks, whites start thinking all the blacks are racist, while the media
[03:03:01.960 --> 03:03:06.800]  and the globalists sit there and play us all off against each other. What type of, I don't
[03:03:06.800 --> 03:03:11.360]  even want to go over it all. I know what you've gone through, I'm sure. I appreciate your
[03:03:11.360 --> 03:03:12.360]  call.
[03:03:12.360 --> 03:03:16.520]  Let's go to Anthony in Pennsylvania. You're on the air. Welcome.
[03:03:16.520 --> 03:03:23.360]  Alex, thanks for having me. And, you know, it's Anthony Antonello in case somebody at
[03:03:23.360 --> 03:03:26.440]  the NSA isn't paying attention at this very moment.
[03:03:26.440 --> 03:03:29.640]  I will tell us, tell us about we are change FBI intimidation. Tell me about it.
[03:03:29.640 --> 03:03:35.800]  Yeah, so here's what happened. I'm sure you remember when I interviewed the police chief
[03:03:35.800 --> 03:03:40.940]  from Gilbert in Pennsylvania who ordered his whole town to stand down if there was going
[03:03:40.940 --> 03:03:45.200]  to be a government instruction telling them that they were going to have to do something
[03:03:45.200 --> 03:03:49.880]  against the Second Amendment. That video went out all over the place. Well, this police
[03:03:49.880 --> 03:03:57.880]  chief, he now has a little thing going on the internet. And on his show, he said this
[03:03:57.880 --> 03:04:03.200]  and somebody called me and I called and talked about it. What he said was he had two federal
[03:04:03.200 --> 03:04:09.800]  agents show up at his house to ask about me. And, you know, he said, oh, I don't know
[03:04:09.800 --> 03:04:15.560]  who he is. He's some reporter and, you know, this and that. But I'm thinking this guy just
[03:04:15.560 --> 03:04:21.560]  did something extremely controversial and the federal agents are showing up at his
[03:04:21.560 --> 03:04:27.400]  house to ask questions about the person that interviewed him. You know, and then he talked
[03:04:27.400 --> 03:04:31.720]  about Nancy Pelosi and a lot of, you know, a lot of the competitions that absolutely
[03:04:31.720 --> 03:04:36.040]  there's an intimidation of the press. If it's libertarian or patriotic or a wake to the
[03:04:36.040 --> 03:04:39.920]  globalist, if you're an opposition to the global corporate criminal takeover, they come
[03:04:39.920 --> 03:04:44.800]  and harass you so you get scared and run off. The answer is intensify. The answer is don't
[03:04:44.800 --> 03:04:48.800]  give into the bullying and there's good people in the FBI as well. There's good people in
[03:04:48.800 --> 03:04:53.640]  all these agencies. We need to support the people that do the right thing, but just do
[03:04:53.640 --> 03:05:00.640]  a report on it. Talk about it. All right. We're coming back with Ted News and stay with us.
[03:05:53.640 --> 03:06:04.760]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best selling book, Cancer Step Outside the

[03:08:39.200 --> 03:08:45.680]  again if you try to take our firearms. The Republic will rise again when you attempt
[03:08:45.680 --> 03:08:52.480]  to take our guns. I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal
[03:08:52.480 --> 03:09:10.480]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:09:10.480 --> 03:09:14.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, he's with us to the bottom of the hour and then he's gone back
[03:09:14.480 --> 03:09:20.160]  to sold out shows across the country on his black power tour.
[03:09:20.160 --> 03:09:29.200]  He's owed to the masters of real rock and roll and he is the Ayatollah of rock and rollah.
[03:09:29.200 --> 03:09:32.960]  We love him. A defender of the Second Amendment par excellence.
[03:09:32.960 --> 03:09:35.680]  Some thinking maybe the reincarnation of George Washington.
[03:09:35.680 --> 03:09:42.840]  He is Ted Nugent out there helping radicalize the patriots to not bend over to the kleptocratic
[03:09:42.840 --> 03:09:50.920]  control freak collectivist and all over the country now I see these the sides of businesses
[03:09:50.920 --> 03:09:56.600]  and barns and bumper stickers. I see him sometimes multiple times a day.
[03:09:56.600 --> 03:09:59.160]  It's some type of underground movement. He said he knows about it.
[03:09:59.160 --> 03:10:04.280]  The draft Uncle Ted Ted Nugent for president. What is going on with that Ted Nugent?
[03:10:04.280 --> 03:10:31.720]  I have the summertime barbecue season to you and all your listeners out there. Well, you know, just that there is a thought or a phrase that exists that's Ted Nugent for president proves how dire, how tragic, how idiotic the conditions are at the hands of an absolutely criminal corrupt America hating government led by an America hating president, a justice,
[03:10:31.720 --> 03:10:44.760]  an 18 attorney general, an absolute num nut as vice president in an America hating secretary of state both Kerry and Hillary Benghazi Clinton.
[03:10:44.760 --> 03:11:02.760]  So I so reek of logic and common sense and so connect with the most productive law abiding good positive Americans out there that there are actually people that think the author of Wango Tango should be president.
[03:11:02.760 --> 03:11:21.800]  We bring it up there and celebrate. You're right. And of course, the man that gave a stranglehold and stormtrooper and so much more. I saw on drugs report.com today at rare.us, which is kind of a libertarian constitutional news site that I'm seeing more and more from some great writers over there.
[03:11:21.800 --> 03:11:35.800]  Carrying your article from TedNugent.com. Nugent Zimmerman verdict vindicates citizens patrols self defense. Uncle Ted, you've got the floor to the bottom of the hour. I want to hear what you have to say on this.
[03:11:35.800 --> 03:11:53.800]  Well, it's very important to just articulate the Zimmerman Martin tragedy in clear and unambiguous and documented evidentiary terms. I'm on the road right now with the greatest rhythm and blues band in the world having the greatest time of my life with the greatest music and the greatest audiences.
[03:11:53.800 --> 03:12:11.800]  So Alex, when I speak, much like when you speak, it's not an individual statement, but it really represents something that's common and sensible. So let me lay out for the uneducated and the ignorant or maybe the those genuine flicking at the altar of denial out there like the Black Panthers.
[03:12:11.800 --> 03:12:29.800]  Of course, my favorite Black Panther, Barack Obama, and probably the czar of the Black Panthers, Eric Holder, and the NAACP that sides with the Black Panther gang. I mean, Alex, can it get crazier than this? What is this a Stephen King movie?
[03:12:29.800 --> 03:12:48.800]  It's just bizarre world. So as I wrote in my articles, I do appreciate you referencing rare.us, rare like and rare meat. And of course, WNDworldnetdaily.com and Newsmax.com. I write a weekly feature in a lot of different conservative arenas.
[03:12:48.800 --> 03:13:03.800]  And what happened in Sanford, Florida is so obvious. It's insane. Absolutely insane that it's become the focus of America when a good citizen, George Zimmerman,
[03:13:03.800 --> 03:13:21.800]  paired about his neighborhood that had been inundated with crime and burglaries and dangerous conditions, that he conducted the most admirable function of an American, and he watched his neighborhood. It's called Neighborhood Watch.
[03:13:21.800 --> 03:13:40.800]  George Zimmerman saw someone after multiple crimes in the area. He called 911 Proving. He was not out to do anything wrong or cause any harm. He called the authorities and identified a suspicious character
[03:13:40.800 --> 03:13:57.800]  that the ABC and other networks absolutely criminally and dishonestly and unprofessionally manipulated the 911 tapes in order to fan the flames of racism that did not exist otherwise with Zimmerman.
[03:13:57.800 --> 03:14:18.800]  And he followed Trayvon Martin and because Trayvon Martin, who I believe, what's the word I'm supposed to use here, so they say is a dope smoker, allegedly a dope smoking gangsta wannabe involved with illegal drugs and illegal guns and illegal people,
[03:14:18.800 --> 03:14:35.800]  Trayvon Martin, emboldened by a Black Panther president and a Black Panther attorney general who refuses to prosecute his fellow Black Panthers in Philadelphia, on screen intimidating voters at a voting place.
[03:14:35.800 --> 03:14:55.800]  George Zimmerman is now being attacked by Trayvon Martin. Officiously, this little boy Trayvon, who is a 17-year-old perfectly fit athlete, has overwhelmed George Zimmerman, has broken his nose, has bloodied his face, has threatened his life,
[03:14:55.800 --> 03:15:08.800]  is now taking George Zimmerman's life and pounding against the pavement. George Zimmerman did what God created us to do, what the Constitution guarantees we have the right to do,
[03:15:08.800 --> 03:15:28.800]  and what all human thesis he tells us to do, George Zimmerman drew his gun in a last desperate maneuver to save his life in a pure and cut-and-dry act of self-defense and stopped the life threat against him by Trayvon Martin.
[03:15:28.800 --> 03:15:46.800]  The bullets found Trayvon's heart and did what all good people need to do, neutralized the life-threatening force, and then the circus began because the great law enforcement professionals of Sanford, Florida,
[03:15:46.800 --> 03:16:03.800]  after studying all the evidence, ascertain conclusively that George Zimmerman defended his life against a life-threatening attack by Trayvon Martin and no charges were filed, as they should not have been,
[03:16:03.800 --> 03:16:20.800]  until the race-baiting gangsters of Jesse Jackson, Al Notso Sharpton, the Black Gangster Panthers, and the Black Panther Attorney General, abusing his authority in the Department of Justice,
[03:16:20.800 --> 03:16:39.800]  came down to Sanford, Florida and fanned the flames of racism and forced the wrong accusation of a second-degree murder against George Zimmerman, and the jury came back, Alex Jones, and basically said,
[03:16:39.800 --> 03:16:55.800]  me, racist, it was self-defense, case closed, and we could go on about the appeal, ascertaining conclusively that there's not a racist bone in George Zimmerman's body or his family,
[03:16:55.800 --> 03:17:13.800]  and that even though the Martin family will be manipulated like the puppets, I am so heartbroken to report, after they suck blood from the community where it took place of over a million dollars is what I have allegedly heard,
[03:17:13.800 --> 03:17:29.800]  and now they claim that they're going to sue George Zimmerman for his civil rights and accuse him of prosecuting for his civil rights violation. I'm telling you, one flew over the cuckoo's nest was not as crazy as this is,
[03:17:29.800 --> 03:17:47.800]  so I pray to God that Americans will make cash donations to the Zimmerman family and contact their elected officials and let them know that the jury in Sanford, Florida came to the obvious and right and lawful conclusion that George Zimmerman
[03:17:47.800 --> 03:18:04.800]  acted in self-defense and that parents should tell their children, if they don't want their children to end up like Trayvon Martin, don't smoke dope, don't want to be a gangster, and don't attack people, case closed.
[03:18:04.800 --> 03:18:19.800]  I want to look at what's happening in the aftermath of all this and why the Justice Department sent in agitators on record to start the protesting. They want a diversion from Benghazi gate and IRS going after the Tea Party and pro-life groups.
[03:18:19.800 --> 03:18:22.800]  Absolutely, undeniably.
[03:18:22.800 --> 03:18:37.800]  So let me talk about that. Why would the White House want to go in and then take the case away from the police chief to where he even resigned over it and then we've now learned of the head of the IT department of the prosecutors quits or was fired
[03:18:37.800 --> 03:18:52.800]  because he leaked that Trayvon Martin's cell phone had like guns and loot on it. All of that's going on. I mean, they were trying to railroad him. There was clearly reasonable doubt that he killed him in cold blood. There was a lot of evidence he was defending himself.
[03:18:52.800 --> 03:19:07.800]  As you've said, this is our justice system. I mean, this is amazing. So what do you make of why they've used this as a diversion, what the goal is, A, and then B, Walmart's being attacked, people being beat up, whites being shot.
[03:19:07.800 --> 03:19:20.800]  I'm getting death threats by the hundreds and hour calls, emails. It is crazy of this summer of rage and of the police don't do anything in places like LA. This could turn into a new LA riot.
[03:19:20.800 --> 03:19:33.800]  Well, Alan, you're absolutely correct. It's a classic case. It'll go down in history as one of the most embarrassing examples of the tail wagging the dog in the power-abusing criminal corrupt American government.
[03:19:33.800 --> 03:19:53.800]  Epitomized by the Chicago gangster Acorn Scammer-in-Chief and his Black Panther attorney general, I mean, it pains me deeply. I'm sitting here in this beautiful San Diego with my son, Rocco, and we just had a wonderful wedding with my daughter, Chantel,
[03:19:53.800 --> 03:20:04.800]  with my kids and my grandkids and my beautiful wife, Shemaine, is joining me on the road for the incredible, gravity-defying career, and the positive energy is palpable and immeasurable.
[03:20:04.800 --> 03:20:21.800]  But it pains me tragically, Alan, because I know it does you to have to admit that our government is out of control, that we're being run by power-abusing America, hating presidents and vice presidents and attorney generals.
[03:20:21.800 --> 03:20:40.800]  The corruption and the abuse of power and the fraud is epitomized by this tail wagging the dog and that there are Black mobs across America that are guilty of the worst racism since the Klan would hang innocent Blacks.
[03:20:40.800 --> 03:20:51.800]  And here's that real heartbreaker that, as I celebrate the Black power to her pain tribute to my Black heroes, the Boat Diddlies and the Chuck Berries and the Hollow Wolves and Muddy Waters and James Brown,
[03:20:51.800 --> 03:21:12.800]  Little Richard, that the number one cause of a Black man dying in America is at the hands of another Black man, that the worst racism against Blacks is documented and undeniable by Blacks, that the Blacks have bought into this lie that somehow they're oppressed when the president is Black,
[03:21:12.800 --> 03:21:24.800]  the attorney general is Black, governors are Black, senators are Black, congressmen are Black, mayors are Black, Oprah Winfrey, the richest people in the world are Black, it is a dirty lie.
[03:21:24.800 --> 03:21:40.800]  And if I may, Alex Jones on the Alex Jones radio show, if I could impress upon and inspire and beg everyone listening now, we've got to reach out to every Black person we know and we encounter.
[03:21:40.800 --> 03:21:59.800]  We've got to pray for Black America and beg our fellow Americans who are Black to admit to this suicidal, self-inflicted curse that you've bought into the big lie of Jesse Jackson and Eric Holder and Al Sharpton,
[03:21:59.800 --> 03:22:15.800]  that you're not helpless, you're not a slave, you're not worthless, you're not inept, you can do anything you want to do if you just get out from the self-inflicted shackles
[03:22:15.800 --> 03:22:33.800]  that have been brought upon by the race-baters and the race industry, the racist industry that have convinced so many Black Americans that you're inept, you're incapable of upgrade, you're incapable of independency,
[03:22:33.800 --> 03:22:52.800]  the food stamp scam, the welfare scam, Blacks can fix the Black problem tonight if they just admit that they can do anything that I can do, anything that Alex Jones can do, anything that Thomas Sowell can do,
[03:22:52.800 --> 03:23:09.800]  anything that any American can do if you put your heart and soul into being honest, law-abiding, delivering excellence at every move in your life, I would like to reach out to Black America and tell them to absolutely reject
[03:23:09.800 --> 03:23:28.800]  the lie of Al Not So Sharpton and Jesse Jackson and the Black Pathers and Eric Holder and Barack Obama, they are enslaving you and the real shackles on Black America 100% of the time come from Black America.
[03:23:28.800 --> 03:23:40.800]  Let's talk about that briefly because 94% of Black deaths from murder in this country, according to the Justice Department, from 1976 to now, over 262,000 were Blacks killing Blacks.
[03:23:40.800 --> 03:23:49.800]  That is up to 20 times the number of statistical murders going on on white on white or other numbers.
[03:23:49.800 --> 03:24:05.800]  What's incredible is you learn that the Democratic Party with welfare and breaking up the family and taking the father out of the home, the model they've done to the Blacks is their admitted model for everybody and that it's a culture of dependency.
[03:24:05.800 --> 03:24:17.800]  They want us all dependent on government because then the government class is one and they even brag about it. Ted, this is really a collectivist conspiracy. Can you speak to that?
[03:24:17.800 --> 03:24:27.800]  Well, I've seen it my whole life. Let me frame it in the most obvious of eyewitness boots on the ground, hands-on life of mine.
[03:24:27.800 --> 03:24:35.800]  I was born in 1948 and there were water fountains in Detroit that were for whites and there were water fountains in Detroit that were for Blacks.
[03:24:35.800 --> 03:24:41.800]  I admit that. I admit the tragedy of that. I admit the injustice of that.
[03:24:41.800 --> 03:24:47.800]  You know Alex by the 60s and 70s in Michigan and in my travels across this nation.
[03:24:47.800 --> 03:24:59.800]  I travel in every major city in this country since the 1960s. I'm still on tour today. I will play, I don't know, almost 100 concerts again and 100 cities again this year.
[03:24:59.800 --> 03:25:18.800]  And Alex, certainly by 1980, I'm a pretty wide-ranging radar, alive, gregarious guy. I've been clean and sober for 65 years. My radar is accurate and it's very perceptive and receptive.
[03:25:18.800 --> 03:25:34.800]  Alex, racism against Blacks was gone by the time I started touring the nation in the late 60s. It was gone. I have Black musicians.
[03:25:34.800 --> 03:25:45.800]  I see Blacks ascending to whatever heights and successes and powers they wanted. There was no oppression.
[03:25:45.800 --> 03:26:01.800]  They might have run into racism occasionally like I did because I had long hair or maybe today the judgmentalism that exists out there because I got long hair and I play loud rock and roll and because I'm an NRA board of director member.
[03:26:01.800 --> 03:26:23.800]  What it does to interfere with my dreams, nothing. You can't stop my dreams. And by the 70s and certainly by 1980, nothing existed. Nothing of consequence existed to deter or compromise a Black American's dream.
[03:26:23.800 --> 03:26:39.800]  If they got an alarm clock, they set it. They took good care of themselves. They remained clean and sober. They spoke clearly and they demanded excellence of themselves and provided excellence to their employers.
[03:26:39.800 --> 03:26:52.800]  And anybody, Black, white, yellow, green or red, if you provide excellence to your boss, you will end up being the boss.
[03:26:52.800 --> 03:26:54.800]  Absolutely. I can tell you.
[03:26:54.800 --> 03:27:04.800]  I just know that. Write that down. And if you, by the lie of oppression, you have just bought the shackles of the racepaders in America.
[03:27:04.800 --> 03:27:22.800]  Sure, because the government and the racepaders and the community organizers, they want to manage the only stunted opportunities in government jobs, government handouts, government systems, and it's literally a cult. The government and the liberal socialist special interests are not liberal.
[03:27:22.800 --> 03:27:37.800]  There's a bunch of social engineers who are the real racist. You know, Margaret Singer said in the 1920s, the head of Planned Parenthood, she said, we've got to pose as liberals, get the Black leadership, break up their families so we can abort these weeds.
[03:27:37.800 --> 03:27:45.800]  That's a quote. And it's worked like a charm. Black folks, the average liberal Black person doesn't get mad about 50-plus percent of Blacks being aborted, Ted Nugent.
[03:27:45.800 --> 03:27:52.800]  They don't want to hear about that. They want to just get excited, because Al Sharpton told him to, because Zimmerman is a white devil.
[03:27:52.800 --> 03:28:00.800]  When, by the way, Zimmerman doesn't, he looks more Hispanic to me than he does like a white devil, Ted Nugent. Closing points on that.
[03:28:00.800 --> 03:28:16.800]  We appreciate you spotlighting the cockroaches. You're the master of spotlighting cockroaches. And thank you for allowing me to have time on your show. But I would welcome everyone listening to come to TedNugent.com, and I write for Rare.us, Newsmax.com.
[03:28:16.800 --> 03:28:30.800]  I also write for WNDworldnetdaily.com, and initiate the dialogue with your friends and coworkers, and people at church and school, and at the workplace, and at the family picnic over the weekend.
[03:28:30.800 --> 03:28:41.800]  We've got to take this country back one good American after another, and reach out to Black America, and let them know that we have unlimited love for them if they would show unlimited love for themselves.
[03:28:41.800 --> 03:28:49.800]  Look, the MSNBC and the White House want to keep Black people on their reservation, their plantation, so they can milk them and control them.
[03:28:49.800 --> 03:29:00.800]  And that's what's going on, and I call for a jailbreak for everybody against the collectivist. Ted Nugent, folks can find out about your sold out tour in most areas.
[03:29:00.800 --> 03:29:11.800]  They can find out where they can still go at TedNugent.com. Thank you so much for putting out your editorial. I think it's absolutely on target, and I look forward to having you on any time.
[03:29:11.800 --> 03:29:22.800]  You want a megaphone, sir. We reached out to you, but any time you want to blast something out there, I know you work hard to get the word out, just like Charlton Heston did, and so we appreciate you, sir.
[03:29:22.800 --> 03:29:31.800]  Well, God bless you, God bless America, and I'm doing a tribute tonight to the United States Marine Corps, because freedom is not free. God bless the U.S. military and their families.
[03:29:31.800 --> 03:29:42.800]  All right, thank you so much. There goes Ted Nugent. All right, folks, that's it for this transmission with Ted Nugent. The Nightly News 7 o'clock tonight is big, and we premiere tomorrow night.
[03:29:42.800 --> 03:29:52.800]  State of mind, the psychology of control on M4 Wars Nightly News. The DVD is now shipping.
