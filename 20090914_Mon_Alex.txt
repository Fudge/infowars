[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:33.000]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones it is Monday
[00:33.000 --> 00:42.000]  the 14th day of September 2009 we're gonna be live for the next four hours and come
[00:42.000 --> 00:55.000]  up in the next segment I'll tell you about the guest we have on the show today we have a
[00:55.000 --> 01:06.000]  very important radio show lined up ladies and gentlemen we are going to have open phones throughout
[01:06.000 --> 01:14.000]  the full four hours to discuss any news any issues any stories local national international
[01:14.000 --> 01:29.000]  legislation Obama right now is giving a speech from Wall Street calling for banking reform and
[01:29.000 --> 01:37.000]  CNN and Fox MSNBC I scanned around the channels this morning we're all following their talking
[01:37.000 --> 01:44.000]  points that we have to have a new special banking regulatory system run by the very same banks
[01:44.000 --> 01:49.000]  that engineered the collapse and the record profits they're making from it we've got to have
[01:49.000 --> 01:56.000]  that or we could go into a depression just like the Great Depression they're saying first the
[01:56.000 --> 02:00.000]  stock market dipped and then a year later it went back up and then dipped again into the
[02:00.000 --> 02:07.000]  nine year full depression so it's a repeat of a year ago they're saying give us more power
[02:07.000 --> 02:14.000]  now the 23.7 trillion they've stolen so far accounting or we're going to have a depression
[02:14.000 --> 02:20.000]  and then if they're not given what they want the next two three months with an expansion of
[02:20.000 --> 02:25.000]  control they will badmouth the stock market the economy again and drive it down even further
[02:25.000 --> 02:35.000]  and then get what they want and use the implosion of the economy to consolidate power so that
[02:35.000 --> 02:41.000]  is coming up ladies and gentlemen I'm going to be breaking that down in some detail and
[02:41.000 --> 02:46.000]  hopefully you'll chime in and want to comment on that subject we also have all the big new
[02:46.000 --> 02:51.000]  developments with the flu the fear mongering accelerating there for the inoculations to
[02:51.000 --> 02:58.000]  begin in just 16 days or October 1st with the experimental vaccine linked to all the serious
[02:58.000 --> 03:06.000]  side effects that doesn't even protect you from all the different mutations of the H1N1 so
[03:06.000 --> 03:12.000]  I hope we'll discuss that also the New York Times and CNN reporting that a few thousand
[03:12.000 --> 03:21.000]  people were at the Tea parties when the Park Service and Homeland Security said two million
[03:21.000 --> 03:27.000]  the quote is approaching two million the Globe and Mail got that right the Daily Mail got that
[03:27.000 --> 03:36.000]  right but our controlled corporate press of course distorted that but there is a riddle
[03:36.000 --> 03:44.000]  within that disinformation Glenn Beck does deserve the credit as the leader of this he
[03:44.000 --> 03:48.000]  certainly co-opted the massive resistance to the banker bailout takeover even though he
[03:48.000 --> 03:57.000]  supported it enthusiastically he certainly co-opted the movement and so in an hour and
[03:57.000 --> 04:05.000]  a half I have a special message very special message public message to Glenn Beck and tonight
[04:05.000 --> 04:09.000]  or tomorrow I'm not sure when we're gonna have a big report up on prisonplanet.com
[04:09.000 --> 04:17.000]  from Paul Watson my message my open letter to Glenn Beck this is your last chance Glenn
[04:17.000 --> 04:25.000]  to not be a Benedict Arnold in history I really want Glenn Beck to be for real but he is
[04:25.000 --> 04:33.000]  definitely the most dangerous pundit on the left or right in the media he is definitely
[04:33.000 --> 04:38.000]  following government scripts if you want to know about somebody who's definitely spook
[04:38.000 --> 04:44.000]  Ryan it's Glenn Beck and I want to explain to people how he's meant to lead the opposition
[04:44.000 --> 04:50.000]  right into the gates of hell but I don't think Glenn Beck is an evil person I think he's
[04:50.000 --> 04:55.000]  an actor and you can look in his eyes he is a very disturbed individual we'll be right
[04:55.000 --> 05:03.000]  back stay with us this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying

[08:26.000 --> 08:36.000]  we are going to take a lot of phone calls today I had some guest scheduled I canceled them

[08:56.000 --> 09:14.000]  okay here are the issues if you just joined us and missed the first segment we knew that on the agenda of the private offshore foreign banks we knew on the agenda was a corporate takeover a corporate bankruptcy
[09:14.000 --> 09:31.000]  putting the United States through fraud into a corporate bankruptcy to the very same private consortium of banks that own the private federal reserve that engineered the exotic derivatives bubble that popped it by design we told you that two years before it happened from
[09:31.000 --> 09:53.000]  from Bilderberg it's in my film end game after they popped it by design they terrorized and panic the Congress into going along with the banking takeover and then on their agenda for the fall and winter of 2009-2010 is establishing a new bank of the world
[09:53.000 --> 10:09.000]  and they have to get the western governments of the world from Japan Germany France the Netherlands England the United States Canada New Zealand Australia and others Belgium Luxembourg the list goes on and on
[10:09.000 --> 10:27.000]  to sign on to this new bank of the world that will set world tax rates world interest rates world currency rates and it will selectively set them the whole world will be a giant insider trading cash machine for the private interest I mean they already have that to a certain
[10:27.000 --> 10:43.000]  bank that will be total they will hunt down the middle classes money anybody who's got a million bucks in his offshore they will hunt you down they will take it this is total vertical integration this is a handful you can count them on less than two hands
[10:43.000 --> 11:01.000]  mega banks running around gobbling up all the medium and small banks insurance companies and I was watching CNN this morning they had their financial expert on there in a little pinch trite suit admitting this I mean they're even throwing it in everyone's face
[11:01.000 --> 11:23.000]  this is total economic warfare we are being savagely conquered right now and it's funny to Geithner it's hilarious to Bernanke they're laughing about it on television
[11:23.000 --> 11:45.000]  Obama is giving a speech right now on CNN calling saying we've done a great job saving you from what happened a year ago today with Lehman Brothers and it'll truly be a year with the banking takeover October 3 next month so less than a month from now
[11:45.000 --> 12:03.000]  what you're talking about 17 18 days from now in fact let's just go to the commander in chief here he is new rules to protect consumers and a new consumer financial protection agency to enforce those rules
[12:03.000 --> 12:25.000]  this is not just the result of decisions made by the mightiest of financial firms it was also the result of decisions made by ordinary Americans to open credit cards and take on mortgages and while there were many who took out loans they knew they couldn't afford
[12:25.000 --> 12:41.000]  there were also millions of Americans who signed contracts they didn't fully understand offered by lenders who didn't always tell the truth this is in part because there's no single agency charts with making sure that doesn't happen that's what we intend to change
[12:41.000 --> 12:53.000]  the consumer financial protection agency will have the power to make certain that consumers get information that is clear and concise and to prevent the worst kinds of abuses
[12:53.000 --> 13:07.000]  consumers shouldn't have to worry about loan contracts designed to be unintelligible hidden fees attached to their mortgage that is the only reform they're really making in what they've been proposing is that it will say at the top of the bill you're paying 30%
[13:07.000 --> 13:23.000]  but these people have no choice so the argument is yeah we're going to tell you slave we're going to tell the sharecroppers how it works this guy is so sick I have his moron supporters telling me that he's gotten the troops out of Iraq when he's actually increased the total number
[13:23.000 --> 13:39.000]  with the contractors replacing them they tell me that he was against the banker takeover and it was bush no it was bipartisan and that creature Glenn Beck got up there on his TV show and help ram it through and I have to sit here and watch him give speeches about the banks
[13:39.000 --> 13:59.000]  and I have to watch Obama con and everybody I'm so sick of it I have a family and I realize what bondage to these people means it just makes me so sick can't America get smart can't you get wise that Glenn Beck and Obama work for the same people I mean can't you do it fading back up
[13:59.000 --> 14:19.000]  complex or the most confusing second we've got to close the loopholes that were at the heart of the crisis where there were gaps in the rules regulators lacked the authority to take action where there were overlaps regulators often lacked accountability for inaction
[14:19.000 --> 14:39.000]  they faded down these weaknesses in fall the republic we cover how they got rid of a rid of Brooksley born Bill Clinton did in 99 the lady who said we've got to restrict these derivatives they got rid of her put somebody into totally get rid of the rules and then block the securities
[14:39.000 --> 14:55.000]  change commission for being able to investigate it and then we interview all the financial experts and show how Obama has now put the very people who replaced Brooksley born who ran the scam in power and they're actually taking all restrictions off derivatives
[14:55.000 --> 15:11.000]  but they're not going to allow small guys to do it only five big banks I mean these guys are going to gang rape us bad folks they're going to hurt us bad and they're just going to go on raping us and on raping us and this son of a bitch
[15:11.000 --> 15:25.000]  he gets up there that slick Harvard lawyer and he just gets up there and lies to people and he's going to hurt people so bad go back to the slick Harvard lawyer
[15:25.000 --> 15:45.000]  that posed a systemic risk were not regulated as strongly as others exploiting loopholes in the system to take on greater risk with less scrutiny as a result the failure of one firm threatened the viability of many others we were facing one of the largest financial crises in history
[15:45.000 --> 15:57.000]  those responsible for oversight were caught off guard and without the authority to act so we gave them 23.7 trillion and growing clear accountability and more power and we're going to have the very guys that engineered it they're going to create accountability
[15:57.000 --> 16:21.000]  IE they're going to come mafia shake down any businesses or corporations they want and in the new banking regulatory bills that they've introduced that Obama tried to introduce a few months ago and he's reintroducing now it allows them to regulate everything down to your business from a hot dog stand to a dry cleaners total economic dictatorship is now being proposed go back to him
[16:21.000 --> 16:41.000]  capital and liquidity requirements and observe greater constraints on the risky behavior that's one of the lessons of the past year the only way to avoid a crisis of this magnitude is to ensure that large firms can't take risks that threaten our entire financial system and to make sure that they have the resources to
[16:41.000 --> 17:01.000]  weather even the worst of economic storms even as we propose safeguards to make the failure of large and interconnected firms less likely we've also created proposed creating what's called resolution authority in the event that such a failure happens and poses a threat to the stability of the financial system
[17:01.000 --> 17:21.000]  this is intended to put an end to the idea that some firms are too big to fail for market to function those who invest and lend in that market must believe that their money is actually at risk and the system as a whole isn't safe until it is safe from the failure of any individual
[17:21.000 --> 17:45.000]  institution oh yeah you know what's really happened here they've given him and this number is two months old now this number came out two months ago ten months into the banker bailout roughly 23.7 trillion it grows by two trillion a month so I don't know add two trillion on 23.7 trillion another two trillion
[17:45.000 --> 17:59.000]  we're talking almost 28 trillion dollars more than double the GDP more than three times all the mortgages in the United States all mortgages everything paid off
[17:59.000 --> 18:23.000]  and he's up there telling you now that they're going to put an end to banker bailouts when what Obama is saying is they've given 23.7 trillion and growing to the very banks who went out and leveraged it in derivatives again
[18:23.000 --> 18:36.000]  just go back to him we'll let Obama with his lies everything's a lie a distortion and chaotic dissolution that threatens the economy and innocent people or alternatively forcing taxpayers to put the bill
[18:36.000 --> 18:54.000]  so our plan would put the cost of a firm's failures on those who own its stock and loaned its money and if taxpayers ever have to step in again to prevent a second great depression the financial industry will have to pay the taxpayer back every cent
[18:54.000 --> 19:12.000]  we need to close the gaps that exist not just within this country but among countries the United States is leading a coordinated response to promote recovery and restore prosperity among both the world's largest economies and the world's fastest growing economies
[19:12.000 --> 19:25.000]  at a summit in London in April leaders agreed to work together in an unprecedented way to spur global demand but also to address the underlying problems that caused such a deep and lasting global recession
[19:25.000 --> 19:40.000]  we'll get the transcript when he's done lying I know most of you don't want to hear his voice and we'll read over the lies coming up later probably in the fourth hour but I want to come back and just start going to your phone calls coming up I'm going to break this down into

[31:04.000 --> 31:07.000]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear
[31:07.000 --> 31:13.000]  we've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see
[31:13.000 --> 31:20.000]  the Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people

[33:58.000 --> 34:00.000]  isn't that nice
[34:00.000 --> 34:05.000]  so coming up in an hour and a half I'm going to spend a full hour breaking down the banking takeover
[34:05.000 --> 34:12.000]  now they had always meant to launch this in the fall and the fact that they've now moved on to this
[34:12.000 --> 34:16.000]  means that they are starting to abandon healthcare
[34:16.000 --> 34:27.000]  now that doesn't mean that they won't still tag healthcare on to the overall budget and ram it through and not care if it's unpopular
[34:27.000 --> 34:29.000]  not care if you don't want it
[34:29.000 --> 34:36.000]  that's what Obama has said, there's a sense of urgency, they've got to fully bankrupt us now
[34:36.000 --> 34:42.000]  and that's what the club of Rome, the CFR, that's what all these scumbags openly talk about
[34:42.000 --> 34:50.000]  and they openly brag and joke that you're a bunch of silly, dumb-down, easily confused TV heads
[34:50.000 --> 34:57.000]  and so you deserve what's happening to you, you're like a ham on the table that is for dinner
[34:57.000 --> 35:00.000]  and you deserve to be fed upon
[35:00.000 --> 35:10.000]  and the globalists have stated that they want a worldwide depression
[35:10.000 --> 35:19.000]  that they want a worldwide depression so that they can bankrupt the economy and make everybody dependent on government
[35:19.000 --> 35:34.000]  and then force you to be so poor that you go on government welfare so they can then control your life and not give you the welfare check if you have more than one child
[35:34.000 --> 35:36.000]  and they mean business
[35:36.000 --> 35:46.000]  okay, I want to go to Kenneth, Ryan, Alex, Chris, James and others, the toll free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231
[35:46.000 --> 36:01.000]  but I will state again, big news on the Charlie Sheen front, Charlie will be joining us live tomorrow at 1.30 Central Standard Time, that's 2.30 Eastern, 11.30 Pacific, 12.30 Mountain
[36:01.000 --> 36:08.000]  with some big announcements and the next phase in our operation to get 9-11 Truth on the front burner
[36:08.000 --> 36:19.000]  we've been successful so far because of you the listeners of this show busting your butts to make his video message to the president, the number one video on YouTube
[36:19.000 --> 36:26.000]  for one day, it's still the number one video in news and politics in that section, but it was the overall number one video
[36:26.000 --> 36:34.000]  with a half million views and growing just with that one version of it, there's thousands of other versions around the web with millions of views together
[36:34.000 --> 36:43.000]  but he's got some other announcements about debate challenges, he's issued to O'Reilly, Hannity, John McCain's daughter that attacked him on the view
[36:43.000 --> 36:53.000]  popular mechanics and others and about his discussions with the White House about a meeting between him, Obama and of course 9-11 victims, family members and survivors
[36:53.000 --> 37:04.000]  that want to meet with Obama to discuss six of the 10, 9-11 commission members going public saying that the official investigation was a fraud, a lie, a cover-up
[37:04.000 --> 37:14.000]  and needs to be quote, criminally investigated. So breaking news with Charlie coming up tomorrow, though later in the show I want to play the red eye on Fox
[37:14.000 --> 37:29.000]  viciously attacking him following the same playbook, almost in the same exact order that O'Reilly and of course Geraldo followed over the weekend on Friday and throughout the weekend
[37:29.000 --> 37:40.000]  and what some of the other mainstream media is doing to attack, but overall it's been a great success, hundreds of papers we know of linked directly from New Zealand to Russia to the United States to England
[37:40.000 --> 37:55.000]  from the LA Times to the London Telegraph either published or linked to his 20 bullet points that Charlie Sheen put out, millions of people read it conservatively, millions of people have woken up
[37:55.000 --> 38:07.000]  and we've got a new phase we're announcing tomorrow as well that will dwarf what Charlie and I and you the listeners have done in the last seven days since last Tuesday.
[38:07.000 --> 38:24.000]  It will dwarf what we've done if you take action and carry the ball on phase two, it will be launching tomorrow, but we'll get into some of the new attacks and hit pieces that are very educational informative to go over and understand coming up later as well.
[38:24.000 --> 38:32.000]  But coming up in T-minus 52 minutes, I will be reaching out directly to Glenn Beck, so stay with us for that.
[38:32.000 --> 38:42.000]  And then I'm going to break down the entirety of the Banker Takeover Bill. If you want to know what they're planning for you and your family, you'll learn coming up in an hour and 22 minutes.
[38:42.000 --> 38:46.000]  Right now, let's go to Kenneth in Texas. Kenneth, thanks for holding your on the air.
[38:46.000 --> 38:48.000]  Good morning, Alex. How are you doing?
[38:48.000 --> 38:49.000]  Good, sir.
[38:49.000 --> 39:04.000]  I wanted to tell you about something that happened last night and it still kind of got me a little on edge. I live in Amarillo, Texas, which is, you know, the northernmost part of Texas. If I was to get in my car and drive to say the Dallas Fort Worth area would take six to seven hours.
[39:04.000 --> 39:06.000]  Probably take longer than that.
[39:06.000 --> 39:25.000]  Yeah, it might, depending on the highway traffic. Last night or around midnight, I wasn't paying exact attention to the time. Got the emergency alert message that comes over the TV. Normally, at the end of the month, for a test for these parts, it's more, you know, weather related.
[39:25.000 --> 39:27.000]  We will get tornadoes and things like that.
[39:27.000 --> 39:30.000]  But you got a local one and it was law enforcement related.
[39:30.000 --> 39:39.000]  It was actually what it said on the screen was civil authority warning and it listed all of the counties in the surrounding area.
[39:39.000 --> 39:50.000]  Now, the audio message was about a kidnapping victim and described the kidnapper and that they were armed and dangerous and that they were last seen in the Dallas Fort Worth area.
[39:50.000 --> 39:56.000]  My question is, why would they need to tell us that here six, seven hours away at midnight?
[39:56.000 --> 39:59.000]  Okay, have you seen my film, Police State 2000?
[39:59.000 --> 40:00.000]  Yes, sir.
[40:00.000 --> 40:05.000]  Well, you see the EAS emergency alert system right there into the film.
[40:05.000 --> 40:11.000]  And in that film, I break down exactly what's happening. I appreciate your call. Let me, let me comment on this now.
[40:11.000 --> 40:17.000]  Briefly, none of this is my opinion.
[40:17.000 --> 40:36.000]  In 1988, the federal government introduced legislation that by federal law, all TVs, all clock radios would have a piece of equipment put in them, a primitive piece of radio equipment.
[40:36.000 --> 41:01.000]  A shortwave receiver, a tiny shortwave receiver and that regional shortwave towers would take over your TV and your radio with a federal command and give you audio messages about emergencies and civil emergencies or environmental emergencies, disasters.
[41:01.000 --> 41:25.000]  But it was decided that that would not be done at that time. Then in 1991, the federal government proposed legislation that all cable systems, all radio systems, all TV systems, all satellite systems and all cell phone systems by law at the point of transmission or broadcast are wired through a FEMA box.
[41:25.000 --> 41:43.000]  That FEMA box receives powerful shortwave transmissions and transmits audio over the radio system or TV system.
[41:43.000 --> 41:59.000]  It didn't pass. In 1996, it did. And when you hear that computer sound, because I work in radio stations and the board ops every day have to do the test. It doesn't go over air, but they have to practice and little FEMA teletypes come out.
[41:59.000 --> 42:14.000]  It's similar to the systems because they go with low tech to make sure it works that they have in the 50s and the 60s with SAC, Strategic Air Command. You see a similar system in Dr. Strangelove.
[42:14.000 --> 42:25.000]  The Pentagon tried to block that film coming out saying that he put classified info out about the C1138 scrambler or whatever they call it in the film. It's got another name.
[42:25.000 --> 42:43.000]  But those are high powered shortwave transmissions that then are decoded inside the machine. But now they're more advanced where the shortwave sends a code and a computer code and then a computer voice can read or it can take over your radio station or it can do both.
[42:43.000 --> 42:55.000]  Now, the Texas Association of Broadcasters, I've talked to some of their top engineers over the years that have contacted me being in stations, working in stations. I've talked to them. I talked to the engineer that does 1260 when I've been over there filling in.
[42:55.000 --> 43:09.000]  I've talked to some of the 590 engineers and they go, yeah, the feds are telling us in the last seven years. There's been hearing this for seven years that soon the feds are going to be taking over radio and TV every day.
[43:09.000 --> 43:25.000]  And they start out with things that sound reasonable like water restrictions or a person who's got Alzheimer's who's lost or a kidnapping. But it's already started in New Jersey, New York and Virginia. I guess they think they have the people under their control there.
[43:25.000 --> 43:41.000]  Where they put up toll free numbers saying report terrorism or report illegal guns and they have these big billboards on the highways in Austin. And for three months, it'll be blue car missing with Alzheimer's patient from Dallas.
[43:41.000 --> 43:57.000]  And it's just meant to sound reasonable and get you used to seeing messages from the feds. And I was in Walgreens the other day buying a toothbrush. And it was flashing an Amber Alert now.
[43:57.000 --> 44:13.000]  So now the Walgreens and local businesses and now the feds are saying under the Telecommunications Act of 96. It's already in power. The feds have aligned to your cell phone. It tracks you in real time. It listens to you. They can dial in even when your phone's turned off.
[44:13.000 --> 44:25.000]  I told you that in 96 people laugh. Now they announce it to let the slaves know because they're getting ready to openly use it. The local emergency management threat fusion center integrates all of this into one area.
[44:25.000 --> 44:33.000]  Into one hub.
[44:33.000 --> 44:51.000]  And what they're doing is they are just completely creating a running man system. You know in the movie Running Man that came out in what the mid 80s. They're living in a police state and there's cameras everywhere. They got big jumbo scron TVs reporting this person reporting that person.
[44:51.000 --> 45:05.000]  Reminding you not to be out after dark or you'll be permanently detained. And now the feds are coming into Hackensack, New York.
[45:05.000 --> 45:21.000]  They're getting the two mixed up. Which the Schenactity, New York. Not Hackensack in Wisconsin. Schenactity, New York. But there was also one in Hackensack. So I got the two crossed saying oh we need martial law. You can't come out at night. The Army's now here.
[45:21.000 --> 45:31.000]  Oh the Army and Marines are here running checkpoints in Central California. You know you're not for drunk driving are you?
[45:31.000 --> 45:43.000]  And then in Tennessee remember three months ago we had the state rep on. The Army suddenly showed up with Homeland Security setting up checkpoints searching everybody's cars and the governor came out and said stop that and the Army said we'll do what we want.
[45:43.000 --> 45:55.000]  Sit down and shut up. The John Warner Defense Authorization Act under the authority of Northcom and Homeland Security. We're going to search your cars. Nothing to do with anti-terror.
[45:55.000 --> 46:06.000]  Once it's all for anti-terror to set up checkpoints they announced oh community meetings in local farming areas and big cities alike. Oh come to the local meeting and learn how to fight al-Qaeda.
[46:06.000 --> 46:19.000]  All the old folks show up and they spend 10 minutes on al-Qaeda. Give everybody free donuts and coffee and then say now if you see your neighbors spank their kid you call the local police.
[46:19.000 --> 46:34.000]  If you see pot plants call the local police. Does your neighbor have cars that are nicer than they should for their job? Call the local threat integration center because having money they're not supposed to could be a connection to terrorism.
[46:34.000 --> 46:44.000]  And we have the local police watching the FBI training videos that teach them the same thing. It's diabolical. Criminals have seized the government.
[46:44.000 --> 46:53.000]  They plan on looting everything until everybody is basically poor. That's how they like it. The elite love having their money and having you totally poor.
[46:53.000 --> 47:03.000]  Then they get to have sex with all your daughters. Then they get to put you in a prison and torture you to death. They get to drive around and fly around in their helicopters above all the shantytowns.
[47:03.000 --> 47:16.000]  They enjoy it. They like it. They like exercising power over you. And Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh and Barack Obama all work for the same people.
[47:16.000 --> 47:34.000]  And so yes, they are now incrementally taking over radios, taking over TVs with the messages for kidnapped children and lost Alzheimer's patients and the jumbo tron TVs are being put up and the big jumbo size billboards are being put up.
[47:34.000 --> 47:47.000]  This is the new America and the Girl Scouts are openly quote going to help spy on the neighbors and look for al-Qaeda and drug users and parents that spank their kids even though it's not illegal.
[47:47.000 --> 48:00.000]  And if you say you don't want the Gardasil shot, CPS is going to take your kids. Doesn't matter if they're in the law and they're going to take you to a dare jail cell and they're going to bring in somebody and they're going to knock your teeth out because they like it.
[48:00.000 --> 48:14.000]  Because that pot belly jail guard has a 75 IQ, but he knows he likes to hear you cry naked in the cell and he's going to beat you and break your ribs. He likes it. He's going to do it.
[48:14.000 --> 48:25.000]  They're going to rape your daughter. And then when they're done, they're going to finally, once they have their system in, they're going to starve whole communities and march people into dirt pits and shoot you in the back of the head.
[48:25.000 --> 48:34.000]  It's going to happen. They mean business. We know what this is. We've seen it over a hundred times in the 20th century alone. It is now happening.
[48:34.000 --> 48:44.000]  The same international eugenics banks that funded Pol Pot, Mal Stalin and Hitler are now in control. Do you understand?
[48:44.000 --> 48:56.000]  And yes, they're just going to continue to take over your local radio and TV and have emergency management announcements and anti-gun announcements. And they're going to have your kids come home and denounce you for a hot bath.
[48:56.000 --> 49:06.000]  And New York Times reports kids all over the country and New York Times says it's a good thing. Write mock tickets. The school sends them home with mock tickets. They're called climate cops.
[49:06.000 --> 49:17.000]  And they wear red and black uniforms in England and the U.S. And so does the city here. Same deal. And the kids are even given a little ball cap and a little patch on their arms.
[49:17.000 --> 49:29.000]  Same thing as the Nazis' war. And they come home and they say, Mom, you don't leave the faucet on when you brush your teeth. Oh, thank you, honey.
[49:29.000 --> 49:39.000]  And the mother's in the newspaper going, Oh, it's so good. She tells me what to do in Long Island. And the paper says how wonderful the children denounce her and say that she can only take a cold bath.
[49:39.000 --> 49:49.000]  Heating the water is a bad carbon footprint as her seven and eight year old's denouncer. So yes, ladies and gentlemen, it's real. It's absolutely real.
[49:49.000 --> 49:59.000]  And when Glenn Beck revealed a year and a half ago when he got up on TV and said, we need to use the Army against Ron Paul supporters. They're dangerous extremists.
[49:59.000 --> 50:10.000]  I went on there and I said, that is an internal government report. I'd seen scores of them. We just got attention. We broke the 50s, 60s, 70s.
[50:10.000 --> 50:21.000]  I don't know. It was in those numbers of government reports. It finally got report news, finally got coverage when I broke the Mayak and the DHS.
[50:21.000 --> 50:32.000]  But I knew when Beck read that a year before that Mayak report came out, I said, he's following government scripts. That guy is directly following ADL Homeland Security templates.
[50:32.000 --> 50:40.000]  And it chill hit me. I went, whoa, actual black ops. And so that's why coming up in 35 minutes, I'm going to break that down.
[50:40.000 --> 50:47.000]  But I'm going to try to go to your calls quicker now. Just Kenneth brought up a key nexus point to all of this. Ryan, Alex, Chris, James and others.

[52:12.000 --> 52:16.000]  What's their objective being world domination?
[52:16.000 --> 52:29.000]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[52:29.000 --> 52:39.000]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open. You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[52:39.000 --> 52:41.000]  America's making great progress for the world government.
[52:41.000 --> 52:46.000]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power. That's their aptitude.

[54:18.000 --> 54:46.000]  It's like to be hated, to be faded, to telling only lies. But my dreams ain't on as empty as my conscience seems to be.
[54:46.000 --> 55:06.000]  I have hours only, lonely. My love is vengeance that's never free.
[55:06.000 --> 55:18.000]  No one knows what it's like to feel these feelings like I do.
[55:18.000 --> 55:41.000]  I just hope everybody realizes that the long road to being there in a death pit isn't as long as it once was. We're far down it. And if they implode the economy, most of these police, most of these military people incrementally will follow their orders.
[55:41.000 --> 55:50.000]  And they are definitely following that path. They definitely intend to carry this out. I want everybody to know what I mean when I'm telling you.
[55:50.000 --> 56:00.000]  This isn't a game. And this doesn't have to happen. But these people are making a try. They're really going for broke. They're really trying to bring in an absolute tyranny here.
[56:00.000 --> 56:12.000]  Ryan in Wisconsin, you're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[56:12.000 --> 56:31.000]  You said about how the sterilization of their crops would take off half of the population and that would be eugenics.
[56:31.000 --> 56:43.000]  You said that the Pontifical Academy of Science said that eugenics or that genetically modified organisms was okay.
[56:43.000 --> 57:05.000]  Well, I'm not a Catholic. Are you a Catholic? No, my father is. Well, maybe you can tell me more about it. I believe a caller called, whenever I was reading an article about the Pope calling for a new world order, and then the caller called in and said there are a lot of Catholic movements that are against eugenics and abortion.
[57:05.000 --> 57:21.000]  And so abortion and GMO crops are two different things. But yes, the genetically modified cross species crops in every case they test them are linked to massive reductions and reproductive fertility.
[57:21.000 --> 57:34.000]  And so I'm not really up on the information being put out on by the Vatican on that. But I have no doubt that what you're saying is true.
[57:34.000 --> 57:40.000]  And then one more question. Do all roads lead to Rome?
[57:40.000 --> 57:50.000]  Well, that's an old saying from when Rome had an empire going. But I think Rome's a big part of the new world order and I've always said that and I appreciate your call.
[57:50.000 --> 58:07.000]  We found out an Israeli diamond merchant kind of an Israeli propaganda arm. They want to play everybody off against each other and that's what empires do. So they get the anti-Semitic groups fighting with the anti-Catholic groups and try to play people off against each other.
[58:07.000 --> 58:23.000]  But I'm not in the anti-Semitic class and I'm not in the anti-Catholic groups. And it's just all mental illness. And I'm not a Scientologist and I'm not owned by a Saudi Arabian company and ABC News has nothing to do with us.
[58:23.000 --> 58:32.000]  And I have nothing to do with Seagram's distilleries and I have nothing. It's about the information. They're building death camps.
[58:32.000 --> 58:38.000]  But if we're talking about blood drinking lizards in the Pope all day, we'll never be able to stop it.
[59:02.000 --> 59:12.000]  Chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water. Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune and developmental system diseases. Now what are you going to do about it?
[59:12.000 --> 59:30.000]  The Acola Blue atmospheric water generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water. The Acola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[59:30.000 --> 59:38.000]  That's right. Clean water right from the air you breathe. Order today by calling 1-800-691-6043.
[59:38.000 --> 1:00:01.000]  That's 1-800-691-6043. Or visit Acola Blue on the web at www.ecolovle.com today. That's AcolaBlue.com.
[1:00:08.000 --> 1:00:28.000]  Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:40.000]  All of our standard of livings have dropped on average more than 50% since the late 1960s in every major index of the different economists we interviewed.
[1:00:40.000 --> 1:00:52.000]  It's going to drop by another 50% in the next five years. And somehow we need to get focused on the, quote, financial reform that Obama proposed six months ago is now being re-proposed.
[1:00:52.000 --> 1:01:03.000]  And coming up in the next hour, I'm going to detail that. Also, I'm going to reach out to Glenn Beck in an open letter to him coming up in 30 minutes.
[1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:10.000]  We're continuing with your phone calls right now. Let's go ahead and talk to Alex in Florida. Alex, you're on the air.
[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  Hi, Alex. Thanks for having me on. I work with the federaljack.com website, and we were up with, we are changed this weekend in New York for the 9-11 events.
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:22.000]  Yeah, I like the stuff that federaljack is doing.
[1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:33.000]  Thank you. Thank you. We work really hard on it. And we got a bunch of great video that we posted up from the week, and then when we returned, we find that YouTube has just pulled our account as of this morning.
[1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:40.000]  And we have hours and hours and hours of videos that have garnered hundreds of thousands of hits over the last few months.
[1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  Are they claiming a copyright infringement?
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  They're not telling us. It just says that I didn't receive an email. It just said your account has been suspended, and all the pages are now...
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:57.000]  Oh, man. And federaljack, because we linked to it a lot, had hundreds of thousands of views on some of its videos alone. I never counted up all your hits.
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:02:08.000]  But that's why you should always create copies or clones. We have more than 10 YouTube accounts, some we don't even really advertise that we have clones up on.
[1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:25.000]  But just re-upload all your videos. We'll continue to try to link to all your great work and go into your account, request that YouTube tell you why, and then file.
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:38.000]  Because if you find out that it was a copyright infringement, they're usually fake, then you've got to file, and you can find copies of other federal filings and write up your own report.
[1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:44.000]  I wrote up a novel report and filed it in federal court, and it's free to file in federal court.
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:55.000]  But I had to file in the district in Texas to get the Alex Jones channel back up. That hadn't been our channel, but we had to take it over because the fan didn't really know how to do that.
[1:02:55.000 --> 1:03:07.000]  He's a great guy. Dave does a great job, but he wasn't comfortable filing federal filings, so I filed it. It took me about three hours to write it, but they accepted it.
[1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:16.000]  And then it found out that it was fake filings to begin with, just like they took the Joker posters down on Facebook with fake filings.
[1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:24.000]  And the good news is they've done that so much now that they don't just accept the first filing, so it's all part of a process, but I would imagine that's what happened to you.
[1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:34.000]  If they don't tell you why they did it, see, YouTube is privately owned, but they hold out that they are free for free speech and open community.
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  But they have been taking my videos down for, quote, racism reasons, and I mean, nothing said about race.
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:50.000]  And I was watching CNN this morning, and the redhead info babes said, it's racism. That's what the Tea Parties are about.
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:57.000]  And then they were lying about what Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh say. You can say what you want about Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh, but they're not racist folks.
[1:03:57.000 --> 1:04:09.000]  They don't talk about race on their show. And I'm just sick of these race pimps, but give folks the Federal Jack website.
[1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:16.000]  It's at federaljack.com, and we've got the phone number YouTube up there, and we're encouraging people to call.
[1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:27.000]  But I know you guys are working hard, but people should volunteer there in Florida and start not just uploading to YouTube, upload there and then like blip TV or something else.
[1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:34.000]  And then always in YouTube, point out your other account. Okay.
[1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:36.000]  Thanks a lot. Thanks for having me on.
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:49.000]  Thanks a lot, Alex. Sorry to hear that happened. Great folks over there. Okay. And that's what I like. We don't need just info warrior groups or we are change groups or Federal Jack groups or 9 11 truth groups or coal pepper groups.
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:57.000]  We need hundreds and hundreds of different groups, different names, an unstoppable tide of liberty so they can't demonize just one group.
[1:04:57.000 --> 1:05:00.000]  Very, very exciting. You are in the true spirit of 1776.
[1:05:00.000 --> 1:05:10.000]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat. Will you continue to be their profit center buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[1:05:10.000 --> 1:05:15.000]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs. You don't have to cooperate. There is a solution.
[1:05:15.000 --> 1:05:31.000]  Inner health botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness. Try their inner food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[1:05:31.000 --> 1:05:47.000]  It even won the award for best super food of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health ranger. I love their nutrition cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system. Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.

[1:06:01.000 --> 1:06:21.000]  I'm Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[1:06:21.000 --> 1:06:35.000]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead. Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages.
[1:06:35.000 --> 1:07:01.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a long time sponsor of ours. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com. Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet. So go to mysolarbackup.com or call toll-free 877-327-0365.

[1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:09.000]  Let's get to work.
[1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:51.000]  Governor's conference call last night here is what Governor Polenti said.
[1:08:51.000 --> 1:09:08.000]  Depending on what the federal government comes out with here, asserting the 10th Amendment might be viable option. We can't really even get the president to outline what he does or doesn't support in any detail, so we'll have to see. I'd say that's a possibility. If we're a little rusty on the Constitution, here's what the 10th Amendment says.
[1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:26.000]  Quote, the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the people. The one little problem with the argument from the 10thers, as they like to call it, is this other part of the Constitution that's called Article 1, you know, Article 1. Quote,
[1:09:26.000 --> 1:09:45.000]  the Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States. That means it unambiguously authorizes Congress to spend money in ways that benefit the nation, you know, Social Security, Medicare, Veterans Care, et cetera, et cetera.
[1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:59.000]  So what are the 10thers really up to? Here to face off, we're Democratic strategist Karen Finney and Republican strategist Ron Christie. Ron, most people in the right-thinking mind know that the 10th Amendment is a bunch of baloney, so what is Tim Palenti going for politically here?
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:16.000]  As he's simply trying to appeal to the right-wing fringe and get ready for a run in 2012.
[1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:29.000]  He's trying that there's no 10th Amendment right in this country and that the federal government can do whatever it wants, whenever it wants, however it wants. We are continuing with your phone calls.
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  There's a lot of issues coming up in about 25 minutes. I've got a personal message to Glenn Beck, an open letter to Glenn Beck, where I'm going to break down his real record and ask him to think twice about being a Benedict Arnold.
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:11:12.000]  And is he really happy? Is the $50 million to sell out the patriot movement worth it for what he's doing? So that's coming up. In the next hour, I'm going to break down in great detail the complete takeover of the economy through the, quote, financial reform package.
[1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:26.000]  In light of President Obama's speech he gave to Wall Street from Wall Street this morning, and we're going to continue with open phones. Right now, let's go back to the calls. Chris in Ohio, you're on the air. Go ahead, Chris.
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:42.000]  Hey, Alex, how are you doing? I just wanted to say, you know, I want to thank you and the team for everything you guys do, and I stand by you guys till the very end. You know, with everything that's going on, I think that Glenn Beck, I never listened to a word the guy says. I never listened to a word Obama says either.
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:56.000]  It's all a bunch of lies, and I think when Obama's coming out saying that all the banks are going to get more power, I think it's ridiculous. I think if you give the Federal Reserve more power, they're just going to continue to inflate the money.
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  You know, so I'm totally against it, and I think that people are waking up, and I think that the media coming out in line about the numbers on the streets really just shows how desperate they're actually getting.
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:17.000]  So, you know, I just, I just hope you guys keep it up because I get all my news from Info Wars. I never watched. I canceled my media or my mainstream TV, never turned that stuff on to make me sick.
[1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  So I'm just hoping that we win this fight and, you know, I stand by you guys. So thanks for everything you do.
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:36.000]  Well, thank you, sir. I would still challenge you to not just only get your news at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com, but to go to the government documents to go to the legislation we list to look at everything we're covering.
[1:12:36.000 --> 1:12:51.000]  Because we're not 100% perfect. We try to be accurate. We try to tell the truth. We're about 97% accurate. Normally, when we're wrong, it's worse than we said.
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:13:00.000]  And that's why we encourage people to research. Most of what we come up with is sent to us by you. You'll say, hey, look at this magazine. Look at this trade publication.
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:11.000]  Look at this subsection in the legislation. You are where the credit comes in and we're posting more and more reader generated articles.
[1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  I'm trying to hire a couple more editors and webmasters so they can just go through all the great stuff you send us and all the great stuff that's posted on the prisonplanet forum so we can then link to it on the main websites or put it in article form.
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:33.000]  But you can submit your own articles, your own stories that we'll look over and see if they are documented. And then post writers at infowars.com.
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:44.000]  Let us know it's an article you've written that you're submitting for us to publish. I want to create an area that's just listener and viewer commentary.
[1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:53.000]  We should create a whole section on info wars and prisonplanet on that just for people's opinions so we can basically put everything you send us there.
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:14:05.000]  And then have some of that material that's more news articles or investigative reports publish as main articles on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:16.000]  But as Ronald Reagan said, trust but verify because sometimes you do show us when we're wrong about something.
[1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:24.000]  Let's go ahead and go back to the calls. Let's talk to James in Texas. James, you're on the air.
[1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:41.000]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call and appreciate what you're doing. I don't trust that big Republican demonstration they just had in Washington that was led by Dick Armey and Glenn Beck.
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:59.000]  I think they're paid and backed by the big drug companies and the big insurance companies and those are the people that want to see Obama fail in his health initiative and I think we need the public health option.
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:14.000]  And you know, if Jefferson was here today, he'd be a liberal, he'd be a Democrat, he'd be pushing for benefits to the people like this health plan.
[1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:18.000]  Well, I don't think it's fair for you to put words in Jefferson's mouth.
[1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:31.000]  I've actually read several of the books written by Thomas Jefferson and his incredibly complex and detailed prose. I have read hundreds of news articles, editorials written by him and major papers.
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:57.000]  I have read over 100 books on the Founding Fathers alone and if you actually knew who Thomas Jefferson was, who swore eternal resistance on the altar of God against all forms of tyranny over the minds of men, you would have known he was against big government and big largesse and the distortion of Article 1 of the Constitution of the General Welfare.
[1:15:57.000 --> 1:16:07.000]  The General Welfare is enumerated in issuing the money so there's not inflation, defending the borders and negotiating trade disputes between the states.
[1:16:07.000 --> 1:16:18.000]  That's it. The federal government has no business running our schools, running our lives. The insurance companies, sir, are actually funding Obama.
[1:16:18.000 --> 1:16:29.000]  He got more money than them the McCain did. They're actually, just like British Petroleum is funding the global greenhouse movement. That's admitted. But the news says big oil companies are against it.
[1:16:29.000 --> 1:16:44.000]  Sir, do you know what Eugenics says? Do you understand that Tom Daschle did write a book saying that he wanted to ration health care? Do you realize they do ration it in Europe?
[1:16:44.000 --> 1:17:00.000]  Do you realize they do ration it for people's behavior? Do you realize the White House scientists did write a book about using the medical system to deny care to you and sterilize you and poison your water supply?
[1:17:00.000 --> 1:17:14.000]  I think you're a little bit too paranoid on that, Hal. But we have good to do. Excuse me. Hey, hold on. Hold on. Hold on. James in Texas, are you a new listener to the show?
[1:17:14.000 --> 1:17:19.000]  No, sir. I've been listening to you for probably over 10 years.
[1:17:19.000 --> 1:17:28.000]  Okay, then you know I'm not a big Republican like they're saying I am now. You know I went after Bush. I just tell the truth as best as I can find it.
[1:17:28.000 --> 1:17:33.000]  What's the solution, Hal? We can't just...we're going to wind up...
[1:17:33.000 --> 1:17:46.000]  Sir, don't you understand they control both parties? Can't you understand they create these fake fights between Republican and Democrat and then there's really not a hair breadth of difference between the two parties in reality?
[1:17:46.000 --> 1:18:04.000]  That's where you're wrong, Hal. There is some difference there and I realize some of the Democrats are just about as bad as the Republicans, but the Republicans too, a man supported Bush and there were at least 35 senators, Democrat senators in the...
[1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:19.000]  Listen, I hear you and I appreciate your call. Sir, Obama took 50,000 troops out of Iraq and put 50,000 contractors in and sent the 50,000 troops to Afghanistan. He increased the troops.
[1:18:19.000 --> 1:18:31.000]  But because he acts liberal, you think the war is okay now. I mean, you're telling me there's a difference and there's only a difference in rhetoric.
[1:18:31.000 --> 1:18:46.000]  And Obama can read off a teleprompter better. It's so elementary. Listen to me, buddy boy. Obama supported everything Bush has done and he has expanded it to a T.
[1:18:46.000 --> 1:19:07.000]  To a T. And Obama is meant to not give you the public option. He's meant to give you some corporate ride-off scam where the insurance companies get government liability protection.
[1:19:07.000 --> 1:19:24.000]  And the government gets to now get a piece of our paychecks to quote, give people government subsidized healthcare. You're not getting it free. Don't you understand nothing's free. There's no free lunch, pal.
[1:19:24.000 --> 1:19:35.000]  Don't you understand that... I mean, I have two people that work for me that live in England. Okay, they're coming here for healthcare. Canadians come here.
[1:19:35.000 --> 1:19:43.000]  I watch the House of Commons on C-SPAN. They do make you wait 18 months for brain surgery when if you don't get it in two months, you die.
[1:19:43.000 --> 1:19:52.000]  I've seen Tony Blair admit that. It isn't rhetoric. Okay, we need government out of healthcare. Government has screwed up healthcare.
[1:19:52.000 --> 1:20:01.000]  The welfare state has brought the 30 million illegal ends to suck off the rest of this thing. I'm sick of it.
[1:20:01.000 --> 1:20:08.000]  Attention, landscapers, house painters, carpet cleaners, pet sitters, gutter cleaners, and anyone who has their own home service business.
[1:20:08.000 --> 1:20:15.000]  Would you love to build a huge and loyal customer base fast? Well, now you can. Introducing the Magic Yellow Flyer.

[1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:07.000]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[1:21:07.000 --> 1:21:15.000]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[1:21:15.000 --> 1:21:21.000]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interests of the American people.
[1:21:21.000 --> 1:21:26.000]  Well, Obama's already fudging. He's fudged since day one in this election.

[1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:44.000]  Next hour, I'm going to break down the total takeover of our economy by offshore banks through the next part of Obama's agenda, the banker reorganization bill, the financial reform bill.
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:25:02.000]  Notice how I told you they'd phrase it. Oh, look, we fixed the economy. It's a jobless recovery, record job losses, home prices plunging, factory shutting down, but big banks are showing record profits off all the money they've stolen, so our economy's better.
[1:25:02.000 --> 1:25:19.000]  And if you don't give us this new takeover power, the whole economy's going to die. It's very elementary. And so now, in the fall, it'll be part two of what we saw last October. You don't give them the total banking takeover power.
[1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:32.000]  They're going to come in and drop the stock market by 2,000 points, and then they're just going to keep doing it until we wake up homeless on the continent our forefathers conquered, in the words of Thomas Jefferson.
[1:25:32.000 --> 1:25:37.000]  Going back to Kevin in Mass. Kevin, you're on the air.
[1:25:37.000 --> 1:25:49.000]  Hi, Alex. Thank you very much for taking my call. That last caller was a bit over the top. I mean, the guy doesn't understand the difference between rhetoric and reality. But two things I did want to mention to you.
[1:25:49.000 --> 1:26:00.000]  Number one, I was listening to you yesterday, and prior to listening to you, I downloaded two articles on the Tea Party stuff going on in D.C. One was the Wall Street Journal, which said tens of thousands of people.
[1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:11.000]  The next one I downloaded was the British paper, The Daily Mail, and bang, they said two million. If you want to see an illustration of press distortion, there it is.
[1:26:11.000 --> 1:26:26.000]  Well, let's be clear. The Wall Street Journal, and I did see that, went with the same party line. New York Times said thousands, and that part of them were Obama supporters, total distortion, as if it was two groups out there when it clearly wasn't.
[1:26:26.000 --> 1:26:33.000]  I mean, maybe one out of 100, one out of 20, who knows, but it was a very small minority for government-run healthcare.
[1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:42.000]  And look at that distortion when the Park Service and Homeland Security said upwards of two million, our own media just can't get it right.
[1:26:42.000 --> 1:26:55.000]  So, see, even the Wall Street Journal is trying to dampen the grassroots movement because the big banks, the big money, they all have piled on for Obama's healthcare plan.
[1:26:55.000 --> 1:27:00.000]  They just tell the liberals that big insurance companies are against it to fool them.
[1:27:00.000 --> 1:27:12.000]  Kind of like in 1913, the Federal Reserve, the private banks that owned it, took out full-page ads in every major paper saying, we don't want the Federal Reserve Act to trick the grassroots.
[1:27:12.000 --> 1:27:16.000]  I mean, there's nothing these guys won't do.
[1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:24.000]  I agree with you 100%. And point two here, Alex, I listened to an interview the other day, and it looks like it's disappeared into the rat hole.
[1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:33.000]  And that was, I listened to Jim Traficant the other night with Greta Van Susteren, and he basically took a shot at APAC, so I think we're never going to probably hear from him again.
[1:27:33.000 --> 1:27:37.000]  But I was kind of surprised. Did you see that interview, and what did you think of it if you did?
[1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:42.000]  I had been really busy launching the whole 9-11 Charlie Sheen thing. I had been really busy with everything else.
[1:27:42.000 --> 1:27:51.000]  I finally, last night, after the show at like 9 o'clock at night, one of the guys said, have you seen this?
[1:27:51.000 --> 1:27:55.000]  And I walked over and watched it, and that was on my list.
[1:27:55.000 --> 1:27:59.000]  In fact, will you pull that? It was like two parts, wasn't it?
[1:27:59.000 --> 1:28:07.000]  Pull that up, because I want to play parts of that later. The James Traficant. Will knows. Will's the one that showed it to me.
[1:28:07.000 --> 1:28:10.000]  So who's, ask him. He's in the other.
[1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:14.000]  Yes, sir. I did see that last night. Go ahead.
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:23.000]  Okay, well, AXL and Alex, I thought he brought us some good points. And like I said, I noticed, like, I've been all over the place, and I've seen virtually no further, no mention of it whatsoever since he gave it.
[1:28:23.000 --> 1:28:31.000]  And like, I'll finish up with this thought. I believe the mainstream media, the corporate media, whatever you want to call them, Fox, I call the controlled opposition.
[1:28:31.000 --> 1:28:37.000]  Basically, they do a disappearing thing. I remember like, Pat Buchanan largely has run afoul of certain interest groups.
[1:28:37.000 --> 1:28:41.000]  And we don't hear anywhere near as much from him as we did say 15 years ago.
[1:28:41.000 --> 1:28:45.000]  And I'm just kind of curious if they're going to do the disappearing act on Jim Traficant.
[1:28:45.000 --> 1:28:48.000]  And with that, Alex, I want to thank you very much for taking my call.
[1:28:48.000 --> 1:28:55.000]  Absolutely. Well, I want to be clear. Pat Buchanan worked for Nixon. I've seen him do some baiting and switching.
[1:28:55.000 --> 1:29:04.000]  You know, becoming pro-war briefly in 2003 when he knew it was political suicide to be against it. Then he came out against it later.
[1:29:04.000 --> 1:29:13.000]  But Pat Buchanan is a lot better than Glenn Beck. I mean, Pat Buchanan actually believes a lot of what he's saying and then plays politics a little.
[1:29:13.000 --> 1:29:18.000]  With Glenn Beck, it's all done on purpose to be manipulative and deceptive.
[1:29:18.000 --> 1:29:23.000]  And it's right out of the government playbook and he's dangerous. He's dangerous.
[1:29:23.000 --> 1:29:31.000]  So I'm going to talk about that when we get back on a host of issues, but I'm going to try to reach out to him straight ahead after this break.
[1:29:31.000 --> 1:29:35.000]  And I've been getting emails saying, why haven't you had James Traficant on?
[1:29:35.000 --> 1:29:38.000]  We've been calling James Traficant for two weeks since he got out of prison.
[1:29:38.000 --> 1:29:46.000]  Paul Hartman and Jaren have talked to his wife over and over again and she keeps very nicely saying, I'm giving Jim your message.
[1:29:46.000 --> 1:29:51.000]  So we're trying to get Traficant on. We were against him going to prison.
[1:29:51.000 --> 1:30:01.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:30:01.000 --> 1:30:04.000]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[1:30:04.000 --> 1:30:09.000]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[1:30:09.000 --> 1:30:14.000]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[1:30:14.000 --> 1:30:18.000]  Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it?
[1:30:18.000 --> 1:30:21.000]  Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it?
[1:30:21.000 --> 1:30:26.000]  Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick?
[1:30:26.000 --> 1:30:32.000]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[1:30:32.000 --> 1:30:35.000]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[1:30:35.000 --> 1:30:41.000]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know.
[1:30:41.000 --> 1:30:44.000]  How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones.
[1:30:44.000 --> 1:30:52.000]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633
[1:30:52.000 --> 1:31:00.000]  or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com. Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[1:31:00.000 --> 1:31:05.000]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[1:31:05.000 --> 1:31:10.000]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[1:31:10.000 --> 1:31:15.000]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs? You don't have to cooperate. There is a solution.
[1:31:15.000 --> 1:31:21.000]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years

[1:32:01.000 --> 1:32:06.000]  This is Alex Jones with important news. I want to warn you about a deadly storm that's fast approaching.
[1:32:06.000 --> 1:32:09.000]  A storm that will affect you and everybody you know. Here's the story.
[1:32:09.000 --> 1:32:14.000]  The current administration is committed to nationalizing healthcare, giving 40 million new people free care.
[1:32:14.000 --> 1:32:20.000]  Now here's the bad news. The current system will almost be immediately overwhelmed by these new demands for free services and procedures.
[1:32:20.000 --> 1:32:27.000]  Medicare and Medicaid are already bankrupt. Many doctors are now leaving their practices frightened by the prospect of forced procedures.
[1:32:27.000 --> 1:32:32.000]  All this is creating a perfect storm which could create unimaginable shortages in the healthcare services.
[1:32:32.000 --> 1:32:39.000]  Folks, it's time to be prepared for the worst. Our friends at Solutions from Science have recently come up with an emergency preparedness course
[1:32:39.000 --> 1:32:44.000]  that reveals how you can make powerful herbal medicines in the privacy of your own home.
[1:32:44.000 --> 1:32:49.000]  It's called Herbal Preparations and Natural Therapies, and it's flat out the best course of its kind.
[1:32:49.000 --> 1:32:53.000]  I recommend you visit this important new website at makeherbalmedicines.com.
[1:32:53.000 --> 1:32:59.000]  That's makeherbalmedicines.com, or call toll-free, 877-327-0365.
[1:32:59.000 --> 1:33:09.000]  I say I shot the sheriff, but I swear it was in self-defense.
[1:33:09.000 --> 1:33:21.000]  Yeah, freedom came my way one day, and I started out of town, yeah.
[1:33:21.000 --> 1:33:31.000]  All of a sudden, I saw sheriff turn around, came in to shoot me down.
[1:33:31.000 --> 1:33:45.000]  So I shot, I shot, I shot you down, and I say, if I am guilty, I will pay.
[1:33:45.000 --> 1:33:56.000]  I'm going to speak about the Glenbeck situation and reach out to him in just a moment.
[1:33:56.000 --> 1:34:06.000]  There's a lot of videos online made by real conservatives and libertarians about how disingenuous Glenbeck is.
[1:34:06.000 --> 1:34:18.000]  But one I saw last week really boiled it down well, demonizing Ron Paul, pushing for the banker bailout takeover bill, which he now claims he's against,
[1:34:18.000 --> 1:34:22.000]  and just other disingenuous things he's done.
[1:34:22.000 --> 1:34:30.000]  So I think this sets the stage for some of you that may not remember all of his deception for what I'm going to cover when we come back.
[1:34:30.000 --> 1:34:37.000]  Here's the video. Glenbeck is a neocon, not a libertarian.
[1:34:37.000 --> 1:34:49.000]  I'm a dope. I'm a rodeo clown. I'm a recovering alcoholic.
[1:34:49.000 --> 1:34:57.000]  I believe so deeply in our Constitution. I was for the Patriot Act. You know that I am actually a libertarian at heart.
[1:34:57.000 --> 1:35:06.000]  The $700 billion that you're hearing about now is not only, I believe, necessary, it is also not nearly enough.
[1:35:06.000 --> 1:35:16.000]  There was one guy last year that was Ron Paul.
[1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:27.000]  When you were on CNN, you would act like he was kind of crazy kooky guy.
[1:35:27.000 --> 1:35:29.000]  I still act like he's crazy kooky guy.
[1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:39.000]  The Ron Paul Revolution. I think it's meant to be a catchy slogan, but I fear some of his fringe supporters are taking the word revolution too literally.
[1:35:39.000 --> 1:35:45.000]  Hey, Glen, real quick, how did you and your network benefit from associating Ron Paul supporters with domestic terrorism?
[1:35:45.000 --> 1:35:53.000]  When you were escorted out after asking him your question, Glenbeck stopped, turned to crowd, started plotting.
[1:35:53.000 --> 1:35:58.000]  What you're about to hear is the fusion of entertainment and enlightenment.
[1:35:58.000 --> 1:36:03.000]  This is the Glenbeck program.
[1:36:03.000 --> 1:36:11.000]  The man has total credence when it comes to the economy. The man does not necessarily have credence when it comes to the war on terror.
[1:36:11.000 --> 1:36:18.000]  And Tim there suggests that we think of the economy, but not in foreign policy. You can't do that.
[1:36:18.000 --> 1:36:21.000]  They're one and the same. That's where all the money's going.
[1:36:21.000 --> 1:36:26.000]  Have you seen any of the stuff that Glenbeck has been doing?
[1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:30.000]  He's on occasion as a Democrat.
[1:36:30.000 --> 1:36:37.000]  The religious fanatics, the capitulating people, does hip work come to mind for the love of our children.
[1:36:37.000 --> 1:36:41.000]  And they are preparing a holocaust, the second holocaust.
[1:36:41.000 --> 1:36:44.000]  He has been pretty discourteous.
[1:36:44.000 --> 1:36:49.000]  What you're about to hear is the fusion of entertainment and enlightenment.
[1:36:49.000 --> 1:36:54.000]  Earlier today I had the opportunity to sit down in the Oval Office with the President of the United States.
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:36:59.000]  President Bush is a man who personally feels the pain of every lost soldier.
[1:36:59.000 --> 1:37:03.000]  I can tell you that the President has incredible passion and resolve.
[1:37:03.000 --> 1:37:15.000]  Those weapons of mass destruction got to be somewhere.
[1:37:15.000 --> 1:37:20.000]  That is the real story tonight. Back in a minute.
[1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:27.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I don't think Lou Dobbs is perfect, but I respect him.
[1:37:27.000 --> 1:37:32.000]  And I think he's for real and believes in what he's doing.
[1:37:32.000 --> 1:37:40.000]  I understand that Pat Buchanan sometimes plays politics, is suddenly pro or and then against the war.
[1:37:40.000 --> 1:37:56.000]  But he's not there to be a controlled opposition meant to be a pied piper to lead the patriot movement astray.
[1:37:56.000 --> 1:38:07.000]  And that's the issue with Glenn Beck is that I know his history and I've seen the dangerous, dangerous scripts
[1:38:07.000 --> 1:38:15.000]  that he's reading from over the last two, two and a half years as coming directly from the bowels of the Pentagon
[1:38:15.000 --> 1:38:32.000]  and the Syop machine. And that is what concerns me so much about Glenn Beck is that he is clearly being put forward
[1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:37.000]  as more than just the heir apparent to Rush Limbaugh.
[1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:48.000]  He is being set up as the leader of the opposition against all things Obama
[1:38:48.000 --> 1:38:54.000]  so that he can lead the opposition astray when the time comes.
[1:38:54.000 --> 1:38:59.000]  And we know that's the case because he's done that time and time again in the past.
[1:38:59.000 --> 1:39:05.000]  The establishment isn't stupid. They know that government takeover of health care is going to be unpopular.
[1:39:05.000 --> 1:39:14.000]  They know that youth brigades and national compulsory service which has been introduced as legislation
[1:39:14.000 --> 1:39:24.000]  and called for by the White House chief of staff and called for by the president compulsory service in a new domestic military.
[1:39:24.000 --> 1:39:26.000]  They know that's going to be unpopular.
[1:39:26.000 --> 1:39:36.000]  So they are putting Glenn Beck up there as the leader of that opposition so that at key points he can lead people astray.
[1:39:36.000 --> 1:39:39.000]  But I'm going to go over the evidence of that in a moment.
[1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:42.000]  I first want to speak to Glenn Beck.
[1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:50.000]  Glenn Beck, you brag that you've got a $50 million contract and I think that's great for you. Wonderful.
[1:39:50.000 --> 1:39:57.000]  And I want to be clear here. I'm not attacking you because you're well known on TV and because you have a big paycheck.
[1:39:57.000 --> 1:40:06.000]  You are a very talented radio host. I don't know how you do three hours a day and then go get ready for that big TV show.
[1:40:06.000 --> 1:40:13.000]  I mean, I know it must be exhausting and you pull it off very well and I admire your talent.
[1:40:13.000 --> 1:40:24.000]  But being somewhat of a novice of history, I also admire the talent of Benedict Arnold, one of our better generals in the Revolutionary War.
[1:40:24.000 --> 1:40:29.000]  And I don't attack people lightly.
[1:40:29.000 --> 1:40:34.000]  Even though I disagree with a lot of things Michael Savage does, I defend his right to say it.
[1:40:34.000 --> 1:40:37.000]  And when he was getting censored, I stood up for him.
[1:40:37.000 --> 1:40:43.000]  When Van Jones was calling for your firing, Glenn, I stood up for you.
[1:40:43.000 --> 1:40:51.000]  When people have tried to pull down Rush Limbaugh as a symbol of free speech talk radio, I've defended Limbaugh.
[1:40:51.000 --> 1:41:03.000]  Even though I know he's a drug-addled, arrogant deceiver who has led conservatives astray because I understand the part you're playing.
[1:41:03.000 --> 1:41:07.000]  You're meant to discredit true conservatism and libertarianism.
[1:41:07.000 --> 1:41:19.000]  And you're meant to be a ranger in this fight as the global corporate state socializes the wealth in this country so they can more easily extract it offshore.
[1:41:19.000 --> 1:41:22.000]  But Glenn, I want to talk directly to you right now.
[1:41:22.000 --> 1:41:30.000]  And I want to tell you that history is what matters and being on the right side of history is what is important.
[1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:38.000]  And you don't want your grandchildren and great-grandchildren to look back on you as a Benedict Arnold as a traitor.
[1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:44.000]  You don't want people to look back on you as a media whore.
[1:41:44.000 --> 1:41:51.000]  You don't want people to look back on what you're doing now as being loyal opposition.
[1:41:51.000 --> 1:41:55.000]  I understand you were hired because you're a slick presenter.
[1:41:55.000 --> 1:42:15.000]  I understand you were hired because of your slick dual message to discredit and polarize the conservative movement for the left to dress up in leader-hosen and clearly fake cry and then admit your fake crying to further convince the left that the right is insane.
[1:42:15.000 --> 1:42:31.000]  But at the same time, you are there to lead conservatives and libertarians and people that were waking up for my show and waking up to the full global system, the world government, the New World Order.
[1:42:31.000 --> 1:42:43.000]  You're meant to talk about just enough of that to get them to then feel like their revolutionary energies against this tyranny are being expressed.
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:52.000]  So they spend their time and energy on your 912 project instead of really going out and taking this country back.
[1:42:52.000 --> 1:43:04.000]  Your whole 912 project is about remembering 912 and remembering the police state and how good the Patriot Act is and remembering how giving up our liberties is good.
[1:43:04.000 --> 1:43:13.000]  And remembering how good it was to believe the lie that Saddam had WMDs and Yellow Cake.
[1:43:13.000 --> 1:43:19.000]  It's about following that neocon agenda, which Obama is continuing.
[1:43:19.000 --> 1:43:23.000]  You know, Glenn Beck attacks Obama and says he's pulling our troops out of the Middle East.
[1:43:23.000 --> 1:43:26.000]  He wants Al-Qaeda to attack us, giving him left cover.
[1:43:26.000 --> 1:43:46.000]  The truth is, Obama has taken 50,000 troops out of Iraq and moved them to Afghanistan and then moved 50,000 plus more contractors into Iraq, boosting the total number of troops.
[1:43:46.000 --> 1:43:52.000]  So when you come out and call him a communist, he's not a communist, he got four times the money John McCain did.
[1:43:52.000 --> 1:43:58.000]  Because John McCain wasn't the heir apparent, he wasn't the corporate slick Harvard person.
[1:43:58.000 --> 1:44:01.000]  And I'm not saying vote for John McCain.
[1:44:01.000 --> 1:44:03.000]  I'm saying we didn't really have a choice.
[1:44:03.000 --> 1:44:14.000]  The media hyped Coca-Cola president, the media president was Barack H. Obama.
[1:44:14.000 --> 1:44:16.000]  And so he was the heir apparent.
[1:44:16.000 --> 1:44:18.000]  He is the corporate president.
[1:44:18.000 --> 1:44:24.000]  But see, Glenn Beck is meant to make conservatives not shift out of the left-right paradigm.
[1:44:24.000 --> 1:44:32.000]  He's meant to keep them in that paradigm and to see Obama as this big leftist, when really he's just a statist looting us for offshore banks.
[1:44:32.000 --> 1:44:39.000]  23.7 trillion has been stolen by the bipartisan group under Bush and Obama to offshore banks.
[1:44:39.000 --> 1:44:47.000]  They're using that money to come in and buy up our economy and the smaller banks and insurance companies and credit unions.
[1:44:47.000 --> 1:45:00.000]  The new reform plan of Obama will give total dictatorial power to a new private board of banks over every part of our economy,
[1:45:00.000 --> 1:45:06.000]  from a hot dog stand to a hair salon to a factory to a car dealership.
[1:45:06.000 --> 1:45:12.000]  And the truth is a bipartisan group wants that power.
[1:45:12.000 --> 1:45:19.000]  Glenn Beck, we played the clip earlier of you saying we've got to support the banker bailout.
[1:45:19.000 --> 1:45:22.000]  Rush Limbaugh wasn't supporting it.
[1:45:22.000 --> 1:45:27.000]  Pat Buchanan wasn't supporting it.
[1:45:27.000 --> 1:45:29.000]  Lou Dobbs wasn't supporting it.
[1:45:29.000 --> 1:45:31.000]  Say what you want about them.
[1:45:31.000 --> 1:45:36.000]  1000 to 1 phone calls into Congress against that banker bailout.
[1:45:36.000 --> 1:45:40.000]  The polls 99 plus percent against it.
[1:45:40.000 --> 1:45:44.000]  But you went on TV and supported it.
[1:45:44.000 --> 1:45:48.000]  And I predict you're going to end up when they plunge the economy again in the next year.
[1:45:48.000 --> 1:45:53.000]  You're going to end up supporting Obama on the new bank of the world,
[1:45:53.000 --> 1:46:02.000]  the new regulatory system over our currency, over the interest rates and over our tax rates.
[1:46:02.000 --> 1:46:05.000]  I saw you read from the Mayak report.
[1:46:05.000 --> 1:46:08.000]  I'd seen earlier versions a year and a half ago.
[1:46:08.000 --> 1:46:10.000]  The DHS report.
[1:46:10.000 --> 1:46:12.000]  I said on air before that stuff was even public.
[1:46:12.000 --> 1:46:18.000]  I said he's reading from federal reports when he says Ron Paul wants to bomb us with a money bomb.
[1:46:18.000 --> 1:46:19.000]  He's dangerous.
[1:46:19.000 --> 1:46:22.000]  His followers want to blow things up.
[1:46:22.000 --> 1:46:30.000]  Knowing full well money bomb meant a big effect in the info war, a term I coined.
[1:46:30.000 --> 1:46:34.000]  You knew what that meant when Ron Paul had a real chance of winning.
[1:46:34.000 --> 1:46:40.000]  And when the media did hit pieces on him, you waited in with the most vicious attacks.
[1:46:40.000 --> 1:46:45.000]  You are controlled opposition and you're to ensure those tea parties are under control.
[1:46:45.000 --> 1:46:50.000]  Those tea parties started with 9 11 truth six years ago in Boston.
[1:46:50.000 --> 1:46:58.000]  And then the current political type started two years ago in Austin, Texas against the banker takeover.
[1:46:58.000 --> 1:47:01.000]  Almost two years ago, a year and nine months ago.
[1:47:01.000 --> 1:47:11.000]  That happened with 9 11 truth and we are changing Austin and he came in and he co opted that entire thing.
[1:47:11.000 --> 1:47:13.000]  Glenn Beck.
[1:47:13.000 --> 1:47:16.000]  I'm here to tell you you're not fulfilled.
[1:47:16.000 --> 1:47:17.000]  I look in your eyes.
[1:47:17.000 --> 1:47:27.000]  You're not a happy person because I know you were poor and ate ramen noodle and we're an alcoholic and lived in a cockroach apartment like you tell people.
[1:47:27.000 --> 1:47:33.000]  And then now you got $50 million and $10 million from your book and all this great man.
[1:47:33.000 --> 1:47:39.000]  But you even admit you almost died a year ago from an ailment.
[1:47:39.000 --> 1:47:50.000]  Really wouldn't you rather at the end of your life whenever that comes next year or 30 years from now be able to sit back and really know that you stood up for liberty and freedom.
[1:47:50.000 --> 1:47:55.000]  Isn't that more valuable than $50 million?
[1:47:55.000 --> 1:47:59.000]  I mean, once you got a few million, isn't that enough for you to be comfortable?
[1:47:59.000 --> 1:48:09.000]  But see, it's about the status and it's about being a winner and it's about being competitive and it's about showing all those people that didn't believe in you that you are a success.
[1:48:09.000 --> 1:48:11.000]  I understand that.
[1:48:11.000 --> 1:48:14.000]  I understand that.
[1:48:14.000 --> 1:48:20.000]  I understand the road to the dark side being overly competitive.
[1:48:20.000 --> 1:48:29.000]  When I was approached 10 years ago to sell out and be what you are today, the new Rush Limbaugh, but no private Federal Reserve, no New World Order was to be talked about.
[1:48:29.000 --> 1:48:33.000]  I was told you could be a star or be on this crusade that's going nowhere.
[1:48:33.000 --> 1:48:38.000]  I chose the crusade and I thank God every day I did the right thing.
[1:48:38.000 --> 1:48:40.000]  Glenn, I know you signed a contract.
[1:48:40.000 --> 1:48:43.000]  I know the stuff's written for you on the teleprompter.
[1:48:43.000 --> 1:48:46.000]  I know this is a Pentagon Psyop.
[1:48:46.000 --> 1:48:52.000]  I knew what you do with the concentration camps right down to what fake camp you would show as a straw man.
[1:48:52.000 --> 1:48:53.000]  I know you.
[1:48:53.000 --> 1:49:01.000]  I study the people controlling you and you are smart enough to know they plan on destroying you in the end.
[1:49:01.000 --> 1:49:07.000]  You're smart enough to know that they're going to build you up and then destroy you in the end.
[1:49:07.000 --> 1:49:09.000]  That's their plan.
[1:49:09.000 --> 1:49:11.000]  You're even a willing participant in it.
[1:49:11.000 --> 1:49:15.000]  Then they'll build you up again later.
[1:49:15.000 --> 1:49:18.000]  Glenn, think twice about what you're doing.
[1:49:18.000 --> 1:49:22.000]  Think twice about what you're a part of right now.
[1:49:22.000 --> 1:49:27.000]  I'm not asking you because I know you can't go all the way to be a real patriot like Judge Napolitano.
[1:49:27.000 --> 1:49:29.000]  That's why you keep him in the basement.
[1:49:29.000 --> 1:49:31.000]  He comes out once a month on your show.
[1:49:31.000 --> 1:49:33.000]  That's why he's on the Internet.
[1:49:33.000 --> 1:49:39.000]  And then they use Brian on there to be the frothing neocon as the counterbalance.
[1:49:39.000 --> 1:49:41.000]  Judge Napolitano tells the truth.
[1:49:41.000 --> 1:49:44.000]  This banking takeover is a complete takeover of our whole economy.
[1:49:44.000 --> 1:49:46.000]  Why don't you have him on more?
[1:49:46.000 --> 1:49:51.000]  Why don't you at least not enthusiastically attack Ron Paul when the time comes?
[1:49:51.000 --> 1:49:54.000]  Because I know right now you're acting like your buddy, buddy.
[1:49:54.000 --> 1:49:59.000]  So you have everybody on your side so you can stab him in the back later.
[1:49:59.000 --> 1:50:02.000]  I know that's the game some big talk show hosts play with me.
[1:50:02.000 --> 1:50:05.000]  What more than yesterday?
[1:50:05.000 --> 1:50:13.000]  But the issue here is just try to do whatever you can to redeem yourself
[1:50:13.000 --> 1:50:16.000]  and don't be a Benedict Arnold in the end.
[1:50:16.000 --> 1:50:21.000]  We're going to write a more detailed letter to you showing all the bad things you've done
[1:50:21.000 --> 1:50:25.000]  and then showing you these tens of millions of people that are counting on you.
[1:50:25.000 --> 1:50:27.000]  You are now the leader.
[1:50:27.000 --> 1:50:29.000]  And I know it's all a big joke.
[1:50:29.000 --> 1:50:32.000]  You see it as hurting and managing these people.
[1:50:32.000 --> 1:50:35.000]  But they've got their trust in you.
[1:50:35.000 --> 1:50:38.000]  And I know you work for Fox News.
[1:50:38.000 --> 1:50:40.000]  I know you work for News Corp.
[1:50:40.000 --> 1:50:42.000]  And I know that you signed the contract.
[1:50:42.000 --> 1:50:48.000]  But just don't do it with so much enjoyment in your eyes when you mislead people.
[1:50:48.000 --> 1:50:53.000]  And just do what you can to not be pure evil.
[1:50:53.000 --> 1:50:55.000]  Because I look at you, I study you.
[1:50:55.000 --> 1:50:57.000]  I think you're a talented actor.
[1:50:57.000 --> 1:51:01.000]  And I want you to really think twice about what you're doing.
[1:51:01.000 --> 1:51:03.000]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[1:51:03.000 --> 1:51:06.000]  I've come with a message of information.
[1:51:06.000 --> 1:51:08.000]  9-11 was an inside job.
[1:51:08.000 --> 1:51:10.000]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[1:51:10.000 --> 1:51:12.000]  Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[1:51:12.000 --> 1:51:14.000]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[1:51:14.000 --> 1:51:16.000]  It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller,
[1:51:16.000 --> 1:51:18.000]  the Thrallateral Commission, the CAF,
[1:51:18.000 --> 1:51:20.000]  and Lisa Dodge.
[1:51:20.000 --> 1:51:23.000]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day
[1:51:23.000 --> 1:51:27.000]  that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[1:51:27.000 --> 1:51:30.000]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11,
[1:51:30.000 --> 1:51:33.000]  a global awakening has taken place.
[1:51:33.000 --> 1:51:35.000]  An inside job?
[1:51:35.000 --> 1:51:37.000]  How dare you?
[1:51:37.000 --> 1:51:41.000]  If you know that there's treason going on,
[1:51:41.000 --> 1:51:43.000]  you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[1:51:43.000 --> 1:51:46.000]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[1:51:46.000 --> 1:51:49.000]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years,
[1:51:49.000 --> 1:51:52.000]  we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.
[1:51:52.000 --> 1:51:53.000]  Please rise.

[1:52:01.000 --> 1:52:03.000]  For years doctors and researchers have known
[1:52:03.000 --> 1:52:05.000]  that one of the major pathways to better health
[1:52:05.000 --> 1:52:08.000]  is an alkaline diet rich in minerals and antioxidants
[1:52:08.000 --> 1:52:10.000]  to keep the body in proper pH balance.
[1:52:10.000 --> 1:52:13.000]  For 15 years people have trusted AlkaZone,

[1:52:20.000 --> 1:52:24.000]  AlkaZone's unique formula contains potassium, magnesium, calcium,

[1:53:00.000 --> 1:53:02.000]  Food security from Eat Foods Direct.
[1:53:02.000 --> 1:53:04.000]  The most valuable protection your family can have.
[1:53:04.000 --> 1:53:06.000]  It's the scary world we live in.
[1:53:06.000 --> 1:53:08.000]  Schools closed, businesses shut down,
[1:53:08.000 --> 1:53:10.000]  and reports of death all from the swine flu.
[1:53:10.000 --> 1:53:12.000]  We've had more bank failures this year
[1:53:12.000 --> 1:53:14.000]  than the previous 10 years combined.
[1:53:14.000 --> 1:53:17.000]  And money will soon be more valuable as toilet paper
[1:53:17.000 --> 1:53:19.000]  due to the nation's $12 trillion debt,
[1:53:19.000 --> 1:53:22.000]  which is why gold is now over $1,000 an ounce.
[1:53:22.000 --> 1:53:24.000]  According to the Atlanta Fed Chief,
[1:53:24.000 --> 1:53:26.000]  unemployment is actually 16%.
[1:53:26.000 --> 1:53:28.000]  And the solution for every one of these threats
[1:53:28.000 --> 1:53:31.000]  to your family is food security from Eat Foods Direct.

[1:54:14.000 --> 1:54:18.000]  All the gold in the hills, all the palaces,
[1:54:18.000 --> 1:54:21.000]  all the power, all the fame,
[1:54:21.000 --> 1:54:25.000]  is nothing compared to being honorable
[1:54:25.000 --> 1:54:28.000]  and being truthful.
[1:54:28.000 --> 1:54:31.000]  And standing up to the innocent,
[1:54:31.000 --> 1:54:35.000]  the crimes of this world government are legion.
[1:54:35.000 --> 1:54:39.000]  And if people really face the facts,
[1:54:39.000 --> 1:54:43.000]  there's no other choice but to resist this tyranny.
[1:54:43.000 --> 1:54:46.000]  Going back to the Glenn Beck situation,
[1:54:46.000 --> 1:54:48.000]  we're going to come back in the next hour
[1:54:48.000 --> 1:54:51.000]  and get into the whole financial reform takeover
[1:54:51.000 --> 1:54:55.000]  that is happening right now.
[1:54:55.000 --> 1:54:57.000]  It's simple.
[1:54:57.000 --> 1:54:59.000]  They know there's a massive revolution
[1:54:59.000 --> 1:55:01.000]  against world government,
[1:55:01.000 --> 1:55:03.000]  open bank of the world being set up,
[1:55:03.000 --> 1:55:06.000]  Fox News, Rush Limbaugh, liberal media, New York Times,
[1:55:06.000 --> 1:55:08.000]  said we were kooks.
[1:55:08.000 --> 1:55:10.000]  None of it existed. It wasn't real.
[1:55:10.000 --> 1:55:12.000]  There wasn't a plan for a carbon tax.
[1:55:12.000 --> 1:55:14.000]  We were insane.
[1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:16.000]  And then now they're announcing it all
[1:55:16.000 --> 1:55:18.000]  after the financial implosion they engineered.
[1:55:18.000 --> 1:55:20.000]  Just as we said,
[1:55:20.000 --> 1:55:22.000]  we were reading their own white papers that were published,
[1:55:22.000 --> 1:55:24.000]  going, please Rush Limbaugh,
[1:55:24.000 --> 1:55:26.000]  please Glenn Beck, read these.
[1:55:26.000 --> 1:55:28.000]  Now Glenn Beck can come out and say,
[1:55:28.000 --> 1:55:30.000]  I'm the opposition to this.
[1:55:30.000 --> 1:55:32.000]  Yes, it's a world government.
[1:55:32.000 --> 1:55:35.000]  And we beat it by passing the banker bailout.
[1:55:35.000 --> 1:55:38.000]  And we beat it by having the army
[1:55:38.000 --> 1:55:40.000]  go after Ron Paul supporters.
[1:55:40.000 --> 1:55:42.000]  They're calling for bombings.
[1:55:42.000 --> 1:55:44.000]  Glenn,
[1:55:44.000 --> 1:55:46.000]  you now have stepped into history.
[1:55:46.000 --> 1:55:48.000]  You're not just some pundit on Fox.
[1:55:48.000 --> 1:55:50.000]  You're leading the 912 movement.
[1:55:50.000 --> 1:55:52.000]  You claim your anti-New World Order
[1:55:52.000 --> 1:55:54.000]  while you openly are for the New World Order.
[1:55:58.000 --> 1:56:00.000]  A lot of people are wise to you.
[1:56:00.000 --> 1:56:02.000]  A lot of people are upset.
[1:56:06.000 --> 1:56:08.000]  And I'm just upset that we couldn't have somebody
[1:56:08.000 --> 1:56:10.000]  like you on our side.
[1:56:10.000 --> 1:56:12.000]  And to watch you treacherously stabbing
[1:56:12.000 --> 1:56:14.000]  people in the back is upsetting.
[1:56:14.000 --> 1:56:16.000]  I got three children, Glenn.
[1:56:16.000 --> 1:56:18.000]  I know you've got a family.
[1:56:22.000 --> 1:56:24.000]  And I know this, you're going to be judged
[1:56:24.000 --> 1:56:26.000]  in this life for what you're doing, pal.
[1:56:28.000 --> 1:56:30.000]  You are one treacherous creature.
[1:56:32.000 --> 1:56:34.000]  And I want you to turn around.
[1:56:34.000 --> 1:56:36.000]  I want everybody to pray for Glenn Beck
[1:56:36.000 --> 1:56:38.000]  that God humbles him.
[1:56:38.000 --> 1:56:40.000]  I know God's humbled me.
[1:56:40.000 --> 1:56:42.000]  I'm more humbled because my discernment's
[1:56:42.000 --> 1:56:44.000]  much greater when I am humbled.
[1:56:44.000 --> 1:56:46.000]  None of us are perfect.
[1:56:46.000 --> 1:56:48.000]  The more I'm humbled, the more I realize
[1:56:48.000 --> 1:56:50.000]  it's wrong to viciously attack O'Reilly
[1:56:50.000 --> 1:56:52.000]  or Limbaugh or any of these people
[1:56:52.000 --> 1:56:54.000]  because they're really just sad people.
[1:56:54.000 --> 1:56:56.000]  It's better just to talk about what they're doing
[1:56:56.000 --> 1:56:58.000]  that's wrong.
[1:56:58.000 --> 1:57:00.000]  I'm very sad for Glenn.
[1:57:00.000 --> 1:57:02.000]  But we can't just be sad for Glenn.
[1:57:02.000 --> 1:57:04.000]  When you go to these tea parties,
[1:57:04.000 --> 1:57:06.000]  you hand out the Obama deception.
[1:57:06.000 --> 1:57:08.000]  When you go to these tea parties,
[1:57:08.000 --> 1:57:10.000]  when you go to these tea parties,
[1:57:10.000 --> 1:57:12.000]  go burn on disk
[1:57:12.000 --> 1:57:14.000]  and Glenn Beck
[1:57:14.000 --> 1:57:16.000]  being for the banker bailout
[1:57:16.000 --> 1:57:18.000]  and demonizing Ron Paul.
[1:57:18.000 --> 1:57:20.000]  Because you mark my words
[1:57:20.000 --> 1:57:22.000]  at key junctures when we need him
[1:57:22.000 --> 1:57:24.000]  and he's at the head of our movement.
[1:57:24.000 --> 1:57:26.000]  He's going to
[1:57:26.000 --> 1:57:28.000]  stab us in the back.
[1:57:28.000 --> 1:57:30.000]  He's going to hurt us.
[1:57:30.000 --> 1:57:32.000]  He's a Judas Iscariot.
[1:57:32.000 --> 1:57:34.000]  He's a Benedict Arnold.
[1:57:34.000 --> 1:57:36.000]  And it's such a horrible position
[1:57:36.000 --> 1:57:38.000]  to be a Judas.
[1:57:38.000 --> 1:57:40.000]  It's the most horrible card
[1:57:40.000 --> 1:57:42.000]  you can draw in life.
[1:57:42.000 --> 1:57:44.000]  And those 30 pieces of silver
[1:57:44.000 --> 1:57:46.000]  he's been paid.
[1:57:46.000 --> 1:57:48.000]  You know, in the time of
[1:57:48.000 --> 1:57:50.000]  Judas' day,
[1:57:50.000 --> 1:57:52.000]  2009 years ago,
[1:57:52.000 --> 1:57:54.000]  you could buy a very nice house
[1:57:54.000 --> 1:57:56.000]  and live for a few decades
[1:57:56.000 --> 1:57:58.000]  on 20 ounces of silver.
[1:58:00.000 --> 1:58:02.000]  And so Glenn really got bought off
[1:58:02.000 --> 1:58:04.000]  for more like 10,000 pieces of silver.
[1:58:04.000 --> 1:58:06.000]  10,000 pieces of silver.
[1:58:08.000 --> 1:58:10.000]  But just with my perspective,
[1:58:10.000 --> 1:58:12.000]  knowing what I know,
[1:58:12.000 --> 1:58:14.000]  how on God's green earth could you sell out
[1:58:14.000 --> 1:58:16.000]  for any amount of money?
[1:58:16.000 --> 1:58:18.000]  I mean, it's fine to have money
[1:58:18.000 --> 1:58:20.000]  and live comfortably. That's a good thing.
[1:58:20.000 --> 1:58:22.000]  I want everybody to be like that.
[1:58:22.000 --> 1:58:24.000]  I enjoy people doing well.
[1:58:24.000 --> 1:58:26.000]  It's not the wealth I'm concerned with.
[1:58:26.000 --> 1:58:28.000]  It's selling yourself out for the wealth.
[1:58:28.000 --> 1:58:30.000]  It's putting wealth at the top
[1:58:30.000 --> 1:58:32.000]  and doing it for that.
[1:58:32.000 --> 1:58:34.000]  I'm just
[1:58:34.000 --> 1:58:36.000]  I pity people like him,
[1:58:36.000 --> 1:58:38.000]  but we've got to
[1:58:38.000 --> 1:58:40.000]  stay on Glenn Beck.
[1:58:40.000 --> 1:58:42.000]  We've got to expose his lies.
[1:58:42.000 --> 1:58:44.000]  America's number one
[1:58:44.000 --> 1:58:46.000]  stories for independent talk radio
[1:58:46.000 --> 1:58:48.000]  for over a decade.
[1:58:48.000 --> 1:58:50.000]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[1:58:50.000 --> 1:58:52.000]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones
[1:58:52.000 --> 1:58:54.000]  and I want each of you to ask yourself
[1:58:54.000 --> 1:58:56.000]  this question. Do you really know
[1:58:56.000 --> 1:58:58.000]  what's in your tap water? In a recent study
[1:58:58.000 --> 1:59:00.000]  conducted by a major environmental
[1:59:00.000 --> 1:59:02.000]  auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals
[1:59:02.000 --> 1:59:04.000]  in pollutants are present
[1:59:04.000 --> 1:59:06.000]  in municipal drinking water. Many of these
[1:59:06.000 --> 1:59:08.000]  chemicals are directly linked to cancer,
[1:59:08.000 --> 1:59:10.000]  reproductive, immune, and developmental
[1:59:10.000 --> 1:59:12.000]  system diseases. Now, what are you going
[1:59:12.000 --> 1:59:14.000]  to do about it? The Acola Blue
[1:59:14.000 --> 1:59:16.000]  Atmospheric Water Generator is a low cost
[1:59:16.000 --> 1:59:18.000]  way to take back control of you and
[1:59:18.000 --> 1:59:20.000]  your family's drinking water. The Acola
[1:59:20.000 --> 1:59:22.000]  Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons
[1:59:22.000 --> 1:59:24.000]  of water from the humidity in the atmosphere
[1:59:24.000 --> 1:59:26.000]  and uses state of the art carbon filtration,
[1:59:26.000 --> 1:59:28.000]  reverse osmosis, and ultra
[1:59:28.000 --> 1:59:30.000]  violent light sterilization techniques.
[1:59:30.000 --> 1:59:32.000]  That's right, clean water
[1:59:32.000 --> 1:59:34.000]  right from the air you breathe. Order
[1:59:34.000 --> 1:59:36.000]  today by calling

[1:59:38.000 --> 1:59:40.000]  That's 1-800-691-6043
[1:59:40.000 --> 1:59:42.000]  or visit

[1:59:44.000 --> 1:59:46.000]  www.ecoloblu.com
[1:59:46.000 --> 1:59:48.000]  today. That's
[1:59:48.000 --> 1:59:58.000]  AcolaBlue.com
[2:00:18.000 --> 2:00:20.000]  Live from Austin, Texas
[2:00:20.000 --> 2:00:22.000]  Alex Jones
[2:00:26.000 --> 2:00:28.000]  I'm going to run through
[2:00:30.000 --> 2:00:32.000]  your phone calls here in a moment
[2:00:32.000 --> 2:00:34.000]  for the next two segments. Then I'm
[2:00:34.000 --> 2:00:36.000]  going to spend the last 40 minutes of this hour
[2:00:36.000 --> 2:00:38.000]  detailing the banking takeover. I know
[2:00:38.000 --> 2:00:40.000]  I harped on this in January, February,
[2:00:40.000 --> 2:00:42.000]  March, April,
[2:00:42.000 --> 2:00:44.000]  May, and then
[2:00:44.000 --> 2:00:46.000]  they withdrew the financial reform
[2:00:46.000 --> 2:00:48.000]  plan and went for the healthcare
[2:00:48.000 --> 2:00:50.000]  takeover of 20% of the economy.
[2:00:50.000 --> 2:00:52.000]  But now they're back.
[2:00:52.000 --> 2:00:54.000]  And so we're going to go over this
[2:00:54.000 --> 2:00:56.000]  in great detail, but first I want to take your calls.
[2:00:56.000 --> 2:00:58.000]  Insummation
[2:00:58.000 --> 2:01:00.000]  on Glenn Beck, though.
[2:01:00.000 --> 2:01:02.000]  The very fact that the establishment
[2:01:02.000 --> 2:01:04.000]  has tried to
[2:01:04.000 --> 2:01:06.000]  put him at the head of the
[2:01:06.000 --> 2:01:08.000]  anti-New World Order libertarian
[2:01:08.000 --> 2:01:10.000]  true conservative slash
[2:01:10.000 --> 2:01:12.000]  classical liberal movement.
[2:01:12.000 --> 2:01:14.000]  The awakening. People that
[2:01:14.000 --> 2:01:16.000]  the majority of the population
[2:01:16.000 --> 2:01:18.000]  that don't like left or right. I saw
[2:01:18.000 --> 2:01:20.000]  close up photos. It was blacks, whites,
[2:01:20.000 --> 2:01:22.000]  Hispanics, liberals,
[2:01:22.000 --> 2:01:24.000]  conservatives, libertarians, anti-New
[2:01:24.000 --> 2:01:26.000]  World Order,
[2:01:26.000 --> 2:01:28.000]  our Joker posters, infowars.com
[2:01:28.000 --> 2:01:30.000]  I'd say about
[2:01:30.000 --> 2:01:32.000]  a third of the people were our listeners.
[2:01:32.000 --> 2:01:34.000]  A third or more were Glenn Beck's
[2:01:34.000 --> 2:01:36.000]  people and the rest were just mainline Republicans
[2:01:36.000 --> 2:01:38.000]  and libertarians.
[2:01:38.000 --> 2:01:40.000]  But they wouldn't be
[2:01:40.000 --> 2:01:42.000]  putting Glenn Beck out there as the leader.
[2:01:42.000 --> 2:01:44.000]  They wouldn't be playing this dangerous game
[2:01:46.000 --> 2:01:48.000]  of even trying to get at the head of this
[2:01:48.000 --> 2:01:50.000]  movement if they didn't know
[2:01:50.000 --> 2:01:52.000]  massive revolution and resistance
[2:01:52.000 --> 2:01:54.000]  was mounting to their New World Order.
[2:01:54.000 --> 2:01:56.000]  That's why they put a Judas Goat
[2:01:56.000 --> 2:01:58.000]  at the front of this.
[2:01:58.000 --> 2:02:00.000]  A Judas Goat
[2:02:00.000 --> 2:02:02.000]  for those that don't know.
[2:02:02.000 --> 2:02:04.000]  A lot of sheep operations that produce
[2:02:04.000 --> 2:02:06.000]  mutton
[2:02:06.000 --> 2:02:08.000]  don't just shear the sheep
[2:02:08.000 --> 2:02:10.000]  and sell their wool. They kill
[2:02:10.000 --> 2:02:12.000]  a large portion of them every year, particularly
[2:02:12.000 --> 2:02:14.000]  the younger, fatter, plumper, juicier
[2:02:14.000 --> 2:02:16.000]  ones.
[2:02:16.000 --> 2:02:18.000]  A certain amount get cut out for mutton
[2:02:18.000 --> 2:02:20.000]  and the ram
[2:02:20.000 --> 2:02:22.000]  is the leader
[2:02:22.000 --> 2:02:24.000]  and
[2:02:24.000 --> 2:02:26.000]  the male sheep, he is the leader
[2:02:26.000 --> 2:02:28.000]  the Judas
[2:02:28.000 --> 2:02:30.000]  sheep or the Judas goat in the case of goats
[2:02:32.000 --> 2:02:34.000]  and he will lead the goats
[2:02:34.000 --> 2:02:36.000]  or the sheep into the pen for the slaughter
[2:02:36.000 --> 2:02:38.000]  and he goes out the other end and the others don't.
[2:02:38.000 --> 2:02:40.000]  There's no doubt
[2:02:40.000 --> 2:02:42.000]  Glenn Beck said Judas Goat
[2:02:42.000 --> 2:02:44.000]  and I just want to mark the chart
[2:02:44.000 --> 2:02:46.000]  just like we're out on the ocean
[2:02:46.000 --> 2:02:48.000]  and I'm marking a place I found submerged rocks
[2:02:48.000 --> 2:02:50.000]  and I ran my boat over it
[2:02:50.000 --> 2:02:52.000]  and I'm just putting a buoy out
[2:02:52.000 --> 2:02:54.000]  and I'm marking the chart
[2:02:54.000 --> 2:02:56.000]  saying there is a big old rock
[2:02:56.000 --> 2:02:58.000]  one foot under the water
[2:02:58.000 --> 2:03:00.000]  it's definitely a rock
[2:03:00.000 --> 2:03:02.000]  and
[2:03:02.000 --> 2:03:04.000]  watch out
[2:03:04.000 --> 2:03:06.000]  and you can ignore me
[2:03:06.000 --> 2:03:08.000]  and drive your boat right over it
[2:03:08.000 --> 2:03:10.000]  and I'm not saying
[2:03:10.000 --> 2:03:12.000]  don't go to the tea parties, I'm not saying
[2:03:12.000 --> 2:03:14.000]  no, go to them and take them over
[2:03:14.000 --> 2:03:16.000]  use their gamble
[2:03:16.000 --> 2:03:18.000]  to try to take over our movement
[2:03:18.000 --> 2:03:20.000]  to take over their movement
[2:03:20.000 --> 2:03:22.000]  the problem is when
[2:03:22.000 --> 2:03:24.000]  Fox News with tens of millions of viewers got involved
[2:03:24.000 --> 2:03:26.000]  they got control of it
[2:03:26.000 --> 2:03:28.000]  and it's always been Pentagon run
[2:03:30.000 --> 2:03:32.000]  I mean Glenn, you have
[2:03:32.000 --> 2:03:34.000]  talked about this briefly
[2:03:34.000 --> 2:03:36.000]  about how the White House scientists are
[2:03:36.000 --> 2:03:38.000]  called to put poisons in our water and sterilizes
[2:03:40.000 --> 2:03:42.000]  but then you also get up
[2:03:42.000 --> 2:03:44.000]  on your TV
[2:03:44.000 --> 2:03:46.000]  show and
[2:03:46.000 --> 2:03:48.000]  said the DHS report was good
[2:03:48.000 --> 2:03:50.000]  that there are right-wing extremists
[2:03:50.000 --> 2:03:52.000]  you were
[2:03:52.000 --> 2:03:54.000]  apologetically in support of it
[2:03:54.000 --> 2:03:56.000]  you were 60-40
[2:03:56.000 --> 2:03:58.000]  60% in support of the DHS
[2:03:58.000 --> 2:04:00.000]  and had milk toast guest on
[2:04:00.000 --> 2:04:02.000]  that supported the DHS report
[2:04:02.000 --> 2:04:04.000]  saying veterans are the number one threat
[2:04:04.000 --> 2:04:06.000]  and gun owners are the number one threat to homeland security
[2:04:08.000 --> 2:04:10.000]  so
[2:04:10.000 --> 2:04:12.000]  just give us a break
[2:04:12.000 --> 2:04:14.000]  I mean I want to believe in you
[2:04:14.000 --> 2:04:16.000]  I know Pat Buchanan isn't perfect
[2:04:16.000 --> 2:04:18.000]  I know Lou Dobbs aren't perfect but I'm not up here bashing them
[2:04:20.000 --> 2:04:22.000]  I don't want to be associated
[2:04:22.000 --> 2:04:24.000]  with all those timid souls
[2:04:24.000 --> 2:04:26.000]  who attack anybody that puts their head up
[2:04:26.000 --> 2:04:28.000]  with the people that have created
[2:04:28.000 --> 2:04:30.000]  a cottage industry just out of attacking me
[2:04:30.000 --> 2:04:32.000]  I'm not asking folks
[2:04:32.000 --> 2:04:34.000]  to do that
[2:04:34.000 --> 2:04:36.000]  to just go out and attack you
[2:04:36.000 --> 2:04:38.000]  and make stuff up about you
[2:04:38.000 --> 2:04:40.000]  but for people to go look at your record pal
[2:04:40.000 --> 2:04:42.000]  you supported the banker bailout
[2:04:42.000 --> 2:04:44.000]  when almost no one else did
[2:04:44.000 --> 2:04:46.000]  you go to the White House
[2:04:46.000 --> 2:04:48.000]  over and over again to get marching orders from Bush
[2:04:48.000 --> 2:04:50.000]  you attack 9-11 truth
[2:04:50.000 --> 2:04:52.000]  and Glenn Beck's a smart guy folks
[2:04:52.000 --> 2:04:54.000]  he's been sent the evidence
[2:04:54.000 --> 2:04:56.000]  he knows the FEMA camp surreal
[2:04:56.000 --> 2:04:58.000]  he knows 9-11's an inside job
[2:04:58.000 --> 2:05:00.000]  Glenn look at what you've done
[2:05:00.000 --> 2:05:02.000]  this is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons
[2:05:02.000 --> 2:05:04.000]  you should consider
[2:05:04.000 --> 2:05:06.000]  buying a solar power generator this summer
[2:05:06.000 --> 2:05:08.000]  number 1 new climate legislation
[2:05:08.000 --> 2:05:10.000]  could easily double or triple your electric bill
[2:05:10.000 --> 2:05:12.000]  number 2 our new energies are
[2:05:12.000 --> 2:05:14.000]  wants to control how much power
[2:05:14.000 --> 2:05:16.000]  your electric company allows you to have
[2:05:16.000 --> 2:05:18.000]  it's true total government control
[2:05:18.000 --> 2:05:20.000]  of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[2:05:20.000 --> 2:05:22.000]  is coming
[2:05:22.000 --> 2:05:24.000]  number 3 in some areas of the country
[2:05:24.000 --> 2:05:26.000]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[2:05:26.000 --> 2:05:28.000]  with the high demand summer months ahead
[2:05:28.000 --> 2:05:30.000]  number 4 the hurricane and dangerous summer
[2:05:30.000 --> 2:05:32.000]  storm season is here again
[2:05:32.000 --> 2:05:34.000]  every year thousands of families lose their power
[2:05:34.000 --> 2:05:36.000]  from weather related outages
[2:05:36.000 --> 2:05:38.000]  number 5 a solar power generator provides
[2:05:38.000 --> 2:05:40.000]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[2:05:40.000 --> 2:05:42.000]  folks I really believe in the solar power
[2:05:42.000 --> 2:05:44.000]  generators offered by solutions from science
[2:05:44.000 --> 2:05:46.000]  a long time sponsor of ours

[2:06:30.000 --> 2:06:32.000]  will you go to the gathering center
[2:06:32.000 --> 2:06:34.000]  and be immunized
[2:06:34.000 --> 2:06:36.000]  you wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply

[2:06:42.000 --> 2:06:44.000]  we don't know
[2:06:44.000 --> 2:06:46.000]  how much do you want all you can get
[2:06:46.000 --> 2:06:48.000]  I'm Alex Jones

[2:07:56.000 --> 2:08:01.000]  to 694-09-1776 today.
[2:08:06.000 --> 2:08:11.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[2:08:11.000 --> 2:08:14.000]  You want answers? Well, so does he.
[2:08:14.000 --> 2:08:18.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:08:18.000 --> 2:08:30.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:08:30.000 --> 2:08:35.000]  Why did I spend the last 30 minutes talking about Glenn Beck?
[2:08:35.000 --> 2:08:44.000]  Because, mark my words, he is at a key juncture and is a key man in the New World Order's plan in this country.
[2:08:44.000 --> 2:08:51.000]  He is getting your confidence so that when he betrays you, when he slits our collective throats,
[2:08:51.000 --> 2:08:59.000]  we won't struggle but to look at him like a Labrador Retriever when you slit his throat with sadness.
[2:08:59.000 --> 2:09:07.000]  Like our own father has just shot us between the eyes.
[2:09:07.000 --> 2:09:11.000]  And I just can't believe how gullible people are.
[2:09:11.000 --> 2:09:17.000]  Absolutely gullible. But that's just like people support Obama.
[2:09:17.000 --> 2:09:20.000]  It's the same cult of personality, same thing.
[2:09:20.000 --> 2:09:25.000]  He lies. He's disingenuous. It's obviously a corporate scam.
[2:09:25.000 --> 2:09:29.000]  The evidence is clear. It doesn't matter.
[2:09:29.000 --> 2:09:39.000]  They like being deceived because they've been raised from the time they were in diapers, sitting in front of television sets.
[2:09:39.000 --> 2:09:43.000]  Okay, let's take a bunch of phone calls and I'm going to get into what's happening with the economy.
[2:09:43.000 --> 2:09:47.000]  And this is very important what's coming up. Please call your friends and family and neighbors.
[2:09:47.000 --> 2:09:53.000]  Tell them to tune in. Whether you're listening to us on the local AM and FM station, Internet, Global Shortwave or Satellite.
[2:09:53.000 --> 2:09:57.000]  WC in Texas. WC, you're on the air.
[2:09:57.000 --> 2:10:00.000]  Hey, Mr. Jones, thanks for taking my call.
[2:10:00.000 --> 2:10:09.000]  Although, on the way you worded all that, there's no doubt that I don't see how I could not respond to that. It was very tastefully worded.
[2:10:09.000 --> 2:10:12.000]  I'd like to make three key points if I may, sir.
[2:10:12.000 --> 2:10:17.000]  One, I'm sure you and your listeners know that they just released a new bin Laden pony baloney tape.
[2:10:17.000 --> 2:10:22.000]  So it's obvious they're going to still continue to try to ride that sway back dead horse.
[2:10:22.000 --> 2:10:24.000]  So we've got to guard ourselves against that.
[2:10:24.000 --> 2:10:31.000]  Two, as I was slipping back and forth this Saturday from watching the Cougars whip up on OSU, I turned into Glenn Beckfield.
[2:10:31.000 --> 2:10:37.000]  They showed a guy wearing a peculiar response shirt. So I think that's really, really good.
[2:10:37.000 --> 2:10:46.000]  And thirdly, sir, I heard Glenn mention, and I mentioned it on your show last time I called him, about the black triangle over his shoulder.
[2:10:46.000 --> 2:10:54.000]  When he didn't speak to that specifically, he referred to the piece behind him at that desk, which is a red stripe with a flag.
[2:10:54.000 --> 2:10:58.000]  He said, quote, I wish I could take the damn thing down.
[2:10:58.000 --> 2:11:05.000]  So I think he is a very tormented man because nobody can cry on cue like that.
[2:11:05.000 --> 2:11:14.000]  He's obviously struggling with some demons and hopefully good energy will overcome the dark energy.
[2:11:14.000 --> 2:11:16.000]  I hear you in God bless you.
[2:11:16.000 --> 2:11:18.000]  Going back to your bin Laden comment.
[2:11:18.000 --> 2:11:19.000]  That was one of our top stories.
[2:11:19.000 --> 2:11:21.000]  Haven't even gotten to.
[2:11:21.000 --> 2:11:27.000]  Paul Watson's written a detailed report that's up on prisonplanet.com right now.
[2:11:27.000 --> 2:11:38.000]  The Intel Center, the two directors of it, formerly worked for Rumsfeld at the Pentagon and the other one as the head of black ops psychological operations,
[2:11:38.000 --> 2:11:48.000]  psyops at the CIA. I mean, you've got two top spooks in psychological warfare running the Intel Center.
[2:11:48.000 --> 2:11:52.000]  And three years ago, wired magazine at a big computer symposium.
[2:11:52.000 --> 2:12:01.000]  We'd already done this at our office and covered it because you learn this when you put graphics up in one video layer.
[2:12:01.000 --> 2:12:12.000]  And then especially if you grab that video layer off the web, you can see the layers when you blow it up on a computer screen and you can see the pixels.
[2:12:12.000 --> 2:12:14.000]  I mean, it's 100%.
[2:12:14.000 --> 2:12:18.000]  It was a different video layer, but it wasn't.
[2:12:18.000 --> 2:12:30.000]  The Intel Center puts their name, their logo in the same video format in the original layer with the Adam Goddan and bin Laden tapes.
[2:12:30.000 --> 2:12:34.000]  Adam Goddan is the Perlman, the former, well, not the former.
[2:12:34.000 --> 2:12:43.000]  He's the grandson of the former head of the ADL who was arrested in Mosque repeatedly beating up Muslims.
[2:12:43.000 --> 2:12:44.000]  He hates Muslims so much.
[2:12:44.000 --> 2:12:48.000]  And they said, look, kid, you want to get the Muslims become the face of Al Qaeda.
[2:12:48.000 --> 2:12:53.000]  Then we can go in there and blow the hell out of these people, take over their countries.
[2:12:53.000 --> 2:12:56.000]  You're going into black ops.
[2:12:56.000 --> 2:13:02.000]  And it's so despicable. And then the Intel Center arrogantly uploads these videos.
[2:13:02.000 --> 2:13:06.000]  And the new one, I haven't had time to blow it up and look at it.
[2:13:06.000 --> 2:13:11.000]  But we've done this in the past, but I don't have a certification or a degree in this.
[2:13:11.000 --> 2:13:12.000]  So we didn't run with it.
[2:13:12.000 --> 2:13:16.000]  But we were looking at these videos back when I was making Terror Storm three and a half years ago.
[2:13:16.000 --> 2:13:23.000]  And on the big screen plasma TV, because we worked with video, I blew it up and I was going to look at that.
[2:13:23.000 --> 2:13:29.000]  You have the same pixel shapes and the same pixel distribution in those layers.
[2:13:29.000 --> 2:13:34.000]  That was put in at the same time because we work with video.
[2:13:34.000 --> 2:13:39.000]  We deal with trying to take web video and other things and make it look okay, blowing it up.
[2:13:39.000 --> 2:13:43.000]  We deal with this and I can look at it and go.
[2:13:43.000 --> 2:13:51.000]  And then I do have tech guys that are experts on pixel shapes and uploads and downloads and conversions and what this does and what that does.
[2:13:51.000 --> 2:13:58.000]  And then this number and that number and where they're studying on a big plasma screen looking at it.
[2:13:58.000 --> 2:14:01.000]  And there's no video layers.
[2:14:01.000 --> 2:14:05.000]  When you blow video up, you see video layers if stuff's been added.
[2:14:05.000 --> 2:14:12.000]  When Fox News plays somebody else's video and puts their bottom third on there, it's crisp and clear.
[2:14:12.000 --> 2:14:17.000]  The other video has got a different pixel and it deals with the conversions.
[2:14:17.000 --> 2:14:22.000]  These are the same video. This thing is clear all the way across.
[2:14:22.000 --> 2:14:31.000]  But then Wired Magazine interviewed a top computer expert with degrees in this and he said, yeah, it's the same video layer.
[2:14:31.000 --> 2:14:36.000]  I mean, you think it's fun to go on the radio and stand up against these people?
[2:14:36.000 --> 2:14:40.000]  These are hardcore soldiers.
[2:14:40.000 --> 2:14:41.000]  They know what they're doing.
[2:14:41.000 --> 2:14:46.000]  These guys go to work every day knowing they're putting out fake Alcada videos.
[2:14:46.000 --> 2:14:48.000]  Fake Alcada audio.
[2:14:48.000 --> 2:14:59.000]  They've gone mainly to audio because major universities and major computer scientists and major special effects experts from France to England to the United States and Canada were on the news saying that isn't bin Laden.
[2:14:59.000 --> 2:15:03.000]  Then they did a voice print of the real bin Laden voice printed on him.
[2:15:03.000 --> 2:15:04.000]  It wasn't him again.
[2:15:04.000 --> 2:15:06.000]  Then they had linguists listen.
[2:15:06.000 --> 2:15:09.000]  It wasn't even somebody from Saudi Arabia.
[2:15:09.000 --> 2:15:15.000]  It was someone from the West Arab from probably Jordan or Israel.
[2:15:15.000 --> 2:15:19.000]  For somebody that speaks Arabic as an expert linguist, they can tell.
[2:15:19.000 --> 2:15:20.000]  That guy's from Texas.
[2:15:20.000 --> 2:15:22.000]  That guy's from Southern Alabama.
[2:15:22.000 --> 2:15:24.000]  That guy's from Northern California.
[2:15:24.000 --> 2:15:26.000]  That guy's from North Dakota.
[2:15:26.000 --> 2:15:28.000]  There's a whole specialty to this.
[2:15:28.000 --> 2:15:41.000]  Major University heads in Canada and France went and listened and said, yeah, not only is the bin Laden not the same voice print and clearly it wasn't even, it was a guy that weighed 100 pounds more with a bigger nose.
[2:15:41.000 --> 2:15:43.000]  It wasn't even the same dialect.
[2:15:43.000 --> 2:15:46.000]  It was an American.
[2:15:46.000 --> 2:15:56.000]  Somebody who had lived in the West, probably America who was born in Israel or Jordan.
[2:15:56.000 --> 2:15:58.000]  I mean, this is creepy, folks.
[2:15:58.000 --> 2:16:00.000]  They really did it.
[2:16:00.000 --> 2:16:02.000]  The feds really carried out 9-11.
[2:16:02.000 --> 2:16:04.000]  You think I like messing with these people?
[2:16:04.000 --> 2:16:07.000]  But I never backed down from bullying in my life, folks.
[2:16:07.000 --> 2:16:09.000]  And, you know, maybe I'm dumb.
[2:16:09.000 --> 2:16:15.000]  Maybe I should just go drink the tap water that the White House admits they're spiking with stuff to sterilize my family.
[2:16:15.000 --> 2:16:27.000]  Maybe I should just let my kids drink out of the number six plastics that they admit caused breast cancer, gesticular cancer.
[2:16:27.000 --> 2:16:30.000]  I mean, what the hell?
[2:16:30.000 --> 2:16:33.000]  How in the world am I supposed to just sit here?
[2:16:33.000 --> 2:16:34.000]  You think I like all this?
[2:16:34.000 --> 2:16:36.000]  You think I like being the big leader fighting this?
[2:16:36.000 --> 2:16:39.000]  No, I'm way past that, folks.
[2:16:39.000 --> 2:16:43.000]  In the past, I did it because I love liberty at my foundation.
[2:16:43.000 --> 2:16:48.000]  But I also did it because I was arrogant and aggressive and have a lot of bravada.
[2:16:48.000 --> 2:16:52.000]  And also down the road, a lot of people tried to stop me from being successful.
[2:16:52.000 --> 2:16:55.000]  But I don't have any pleasure in being successful.
[2:16:55.000 --> 2:16:57.000]  I don't have any pleasure in being arrogant.
[2:16:57.000 --> 2:16:59.000]  All of that's basically gone now.
[2:16:59.000 --> 2:17:02.000]  And I'm a better man because of it.
[2:17:02.000 --> 2:17:15.000]  But you know why? Getting situated, getting familiar with death or imprisonment or torture will do that to you.
[2:17:15.000 --> 2:17:16.000]  But it's a great blessing.
[2:17:16.000 --> 2:17:20.000]  I have stepped in to what it is to be a real man.
[2:17:20.000 --> 2:17:25.000]  I've stepped in to guarding the innocent, facing down the steamroller of the New World Order.
[2:17:25.000 --> 2:17:29.000]  And the point of no return was passed a decade ago for me.
[2:17:29.000 --> 2:17:32.000]  And I just thank God I'm in this position.
[2:17:32.000 --> 2:17:38.000]  But I'll tell all of you out there that have made it a cottage industry to attack me and lie about me and twist and distort.
[2:17:38.000 --> 2:17:42.000]  I love you and I feel sorry for you.
[2:17:42.000 --> 2:17:51.000]  I hate the evil you're involved in, but I realize that it's part of the blight, the spiritual blight that's on our society.
[2:17:51.000 --> 2:18:00.000]  And I asked God in the last few months to just give me an answer or to comfort me against the lies, the distortions, the attacks.
[2:18:00.000 --> 2:18:02.000]  And now they don't even hurt me anymore.
[2:18:02.000 --> 2:18:04.000]  God healed my heart of that.
[2:18:04.000 --> 2:18:09.000]  It didn't hurt me much, but it would make me kind of evil and aggressive and, you know, screw them.
[2:18:09.000 --> 2:18:12.000]  I didn't want that have that attitude.
[2:18:12.000 --> 2:18:20.000]  And I asked God to change my heart and God has changed my heart and given me something deeper and more true, but also more painful.
[2:18:20.000 --> 2:18:23.000]  I feel sorry for Glenn Beck.
[2:18:23.000 --> 2:18:25.000]  I feel sorry for Rush Limbaugh.
[2:18:25.000 --> 2:18:27.000]  I feel sorry for Barack Obama.
[2:18:27.000 --> 2:18:29.000]  I feel sorry for the people that lie about me.
[2:18:29.000 --> 2:18:47.000]  I feel sorry for Adam Gadon, who knows he goes in and does videos posing as Al Qaeda and thinks that being involved in 9-11, you know, with Israel in the U.S. is a good thing because in the end it will help America beat the Muslims and the Muslims are evil.
[2:18:47.000 --> 2:19:00.000]  And we have to get America and Israel's head screwed on straight to face this and all this crap in justifies the means of Machiavellian bull.
[2:19:00.000 --> 2:19:02.000]  I just am sad for our species.
[2:19:02.000 --> 2:19:13.000]  I just want something better for our species as a whole.
[2:19:13.000 --> 2:19:15.000]  But the good news is the people are waking up.
[2:19:15.000 --> 2:19:17.000]  Paul Watson's got an article up right now.
[2:19:17.000 --> 2:19:21.000]  Scientific poll 29% of Americans trust mainstream media.
[2:19:21.000 --> 2:19:24.000]  That's a key report from Paul Watson.
[2:19:24.000 --> 2:19:26.000]  And I said I'd take calls.
[2:19:26.000 --> 2:19:31.000]  We're just going to take calls until I'm done with at least George, Kevin, Dave, Sandy and Chris.
[2:19:31.000 --> 2:19:33.000]  I'm going to try to go to you quickly.
[2:19:33.000 --> 2:19:36.000]  Then I'm going to cover the financial news by probably 45 after.
[2:19:36.000 --> 2:19:38.000]  So it's the most important news of the day.
[2:19:38.000 --> 2:19:41.000]  But you got me off on a whole bin Laden thing.
[2:19:41.000 --> 2:19:45.000]  I think of the special forces guys they had blow those towers.
[2:19:45.000 --> 2:19:53.000]  They really burn their souls up on that day.
[2:19:53.000 --> 2:20:01.000]  And it's painful to see people destroy in their spiritual futures.
[2:20:01.000 --> 2:20:12.000]  Studies have shown that many people do not get the proper vitamins and minerals necessary to maintain good health with so many places to choose from deciding where and what to buy can be a lengthy frustrating process.
[2:20:12.000 --> 2:20:14.000]  The answer is simple.

[2:21:01.000 --> 2:21:06.000]  It is a big idea. A new world order.
[2:21:06.000 --> 2:21:11.000]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[2:21:11.000 --> 2:21:13.000]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[2:21:13.000 --> 2:21:16.000]  But their objective being world domination.
[2:21:16.000 --> 2:21:19.000]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[2:21:19.000 --> 2:21:27.000]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[2:21:27.000 --> 2:21:35.000]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[2:21:39.000 --> 2:21:42.000]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[2:21:42.000 --> 2:21:45.000]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need.
[2:21:45.000 --> 2:21:47.000]  They're after power. Yes, they're after music.

[2:24:21.000 --> 2:24:43.000]  Could the West, being in Afghanistan and Iraq, 8 years later if it wasn't for bin Laden tapes
[2:24:43.000 --> 2:24:49.000]  that are released from the CIA-run Intel Center publicly doled out every anniversary?
[2:24:49.000 --> 2:24:52.000]  It's not working anymore.
[2:24:52.000 --> 2:24:59.000]  Even the Mail Online, usually a pretty conservative newspaper, has Osama bin Laden been dead for seven years
[2:24:59.000 --> 2:25:05.000]  and are the U.S. and Britain covering it up to continue the war on terror?
[2:25:05.000 --> 2:25:09.000]  We'll give you a close shot of that on the document cam for PrismPlanet.tv viewers.
[2:25:09.000 --> 2:25:12.000]  Let's go to George in Pennsylvania.
[2:25:12.000 --> 2:25:14.000]  George, you're on the air.
[2:25:14.000 --> 2:25:19.000]  The three really important things, they'll all just take a minute.
[2:25:19.000 --> 2:25:23.000]  The H1N1 vaccine is going to be given out by private physicians.
[2:25:23.000 --> 2:25:26.000]  I think everybody should line up, go to their doctor, ask them to squirt it in the trash
[2:25:26.000 --> 2:25:30.000]  and record that they got it just in case it comes to forced vaccination later.
[2:25:30.000 --> 2:25:34.000]  Number two, went to the Cook Islands with my kids.
[2:25:34.000 --> 2:25:36.000]  There's only 20,000 people that live there.
[2:25:36.000 --> 2:25:40.000]  We talked with at least 1,000 people and I don't think they're there.
[2:25:40.000 --> 2:25:45.000]  Maybe the people that really have the big money may have been registered there
[2:25:45.000 --> 2:25:47.000]  because the Cook Islands was the last place in the world.
[2:25:47.000 --> 2:25:52.000]  They have unnumbered bank accounts and they're closing a loophole now.
[2:25:52.000 --> 2:25:54.000]  They may have been registered there. They're not there.
[2:25:54.000 --> 2:25:56.000]  We search everywhere.
[2:25:56.000 --> 2:26:00.000]  Number three, one of my kids got a book to read on the way,
[2:26:00.000 --> 2:26:04.000]  a history of the people of the United States, volume two, and it looks like it was written by you.
[2:26:04.000 --> 2:26:11.000]  It talks about banker control and banker takeover of the financial system and the Illuminati.
[2:26:11.000 --> 2:26:19.000]  It was written in 1897 and that was from the first part of the country.
[2:26:19.000 --> 2:26:23.000]  That was republished under the name, The Coming Battle.
[2:26:23.000 --> 2:26:27.000]  The Treasury Department, when Jefferson took over,
[2:26:27.000 --> 2:26:31.000]  it was a question of where the money had gone to.
[2:26:31.000 --> 2:26:36.000]  Interestingly, there was a fire when they were getting ready to look into this
[2:26:36.000 --> 2:26:38.000]  and the Treasury was consumed.
[2:26:38.000 --> 2:26:42.000]  Yeah, you give private interest the power to issue all the currency and credit they want.
[2:26:42.000 --> 2:26:46.000]  They're going to bankrupt everything and you're going to wake up homeless
[2:26:46.000 --> 2:26:48.000]  on the continent your forefathers conquered.
[2:26:48.000 --> 2:26:54.000]  I just wonder if this might give us an indication where the next big attack might come for our country now.
[2:26:54.000 --> 2:26:57.000]  Oh yes, the terrorist. Well, they don't even need to do that.
[2:26:57.000 --> 2:27:00.000]  Back then, people would get mad so they'd burn down the records.
[2:27:00.000 --> 2:27:02.000]  Now they just steal it right in front of us and say,
[2:27:02.000 --> 2:27:06.000]  you don't like it, SWAT teams will come machine gun you and your family.
[2:27:06.000 --> 2:27:11.000]  They're using two different pincers.
[2:27:11.000 --> 2:27:16.000]  They're using the fake terror and the fake environmentalism to make humans the enemy
[2:27:16.000 --> 2:27:18.000]  and so the state can capture us.
[2:27:18.000 --> 2:27:20.000]  I appreciate your call. Great points, George.
[2:27:20.000 --> 2:27:23.000]  Kevin and Canada, Kevin, you're on the air.
[2:27:23.000 --> 2:27:25.000]  Yeah, good afternoon, Alex.
[2:27:25.000 --> 2:27:28.000]  Anyone that's been listening to you for a month knows that you're bipartisan.
[2:27:28.000 --> 2:27:32.000]  From American dictators to Obama deception, no one needs 10 years to see that.
[2:27:32.000 --> 2:27:35.000]  If after 10 years you don't know that, you're a lost cause.
[2:27:35.000 --> 2:27:40.000]  Anyone that does need to get a prison planet membership, though,
[2:27:40.000 --> 2:27:43.000]  that's the great thing that you guys have available.
[2:27:43.000 --> 2:27:48.000]  I haven't plugged anything yet today because I'm intending to totally get my mind off the videos
[2:27:48.000 --> 2:27:53.000]  and books and materials and not only are they great things to wake people up,
[2:27:53.000 --> 2:27:57.000]  that's how we fund our operation and our revenue has fallen way down the last few months
[2:27:57.000 --> 2:27:59.000]  because I just really don't plug things like I used to.
[2:27:59.000 --> 2:28:01.000]  So thanks for plugging it for me.
[2:28:01.000 --> 2:28:02.000]  No problem.
[2:28:02.000 --> 2:28:12.000]  My local newspaper has been carrying many articles linking the Internet to teaching the criminals to be criminals, basically.
[2:28:12.000 --> 2:28:14.000]  Yeah, that's the new thing is that they demonize it.
[2:28:14.000 --> 2:28:22.000]  And Infowars and Jones report on major government systems and private systems are listed as criminal knowledge,
[2:28:22.000 --> 2:28:27.000]  criminal skills, websites where the browsers tell you not to go there, yes.
[2:28:27.000 --> 2:28:32.000]  Yeah, they've got this ex-cop who's testifying that he learned how to be a biker on the Internet
[2:28:32.000 --> 2:28:35.000]  like he can't learn to be a biker somewhere else.
[2:28:35.000 --> 2:28:37.000]  As if being a biker is criminal.
[2:28:37.000 --> 2:28:44.000]  Well, some of these bikers are, of course, but they're running all these demonizing pieces about
[2:28:44.000 --> 2:28:48.000]  basically free speech on the Internet, writing us all for the Internet, too.
[2:28:48.000 --> 2:28:55.000]  Yeah, they've announced Internet, too, cybersecurity command in the president's own words so they can shut the web down for all our safety.
[2:28:55.000 --> 2:28:58.000]  J. Rockefeller says we'd be better off without it.
[2:28:58.000 --> 2:29:01.000]  And I keep warning people, it's here.
[2:29:01.000 --> 2:29:07.000]  You know, I want to beat these people and I want to fight.
[2:29:07.000 --> 2:29:15.000]  But in a sick way, if they lock me up or shut me down, I want it to do this every day because, I mean, look, I know we're reaching a lot of people.
[2:29:15.000 --> 2:29:19.000]  I know it's really positive.
[2:29:19.000 --> 2:29:23.000]  It's just, I'm so sick of looking at the New World Order people.
[2:29:23.000 --> 2:29:25.000]  I'm so sick of their enjoyment of evil.
[2:29:25.000 --> 2:29:28.000]  I'm so sick of, hey, great call.
[2:29:28.000 --> 2:29:30.000]  Anything else, Kevin?
[2:29:30.000 --> 2:29:39.000]  Yeah, I was surfing some Joe Rogan comedy after watching him on Bermas' show and I noticed that on this other show that he was on, they had video call-in.
[2:29:39.000 --> 2:29:44.000]  I don't believe Joe Rogan was on Jason Bermas' show, but you can finish up on the other side.
[2:29:44.000 --> 2:29:46.000]  Well, they're right by it.
[2:30:15.000 --> 2:30:21.000]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[2:30:21.000 --> 2:30:23.000]  Now, what are you going to do about it?

[2:33:14.000 --> 2:33:24.000]  The people are waking up.
[2:33:24.000 --> 2:33:31.000]  So the establishment is giving them fake alternatives.
[2:33:31.000 --> 2:33:36.000]  Judas Goats, controlled opposition.
[2:33:36.000 --> 2:33:47.000]  But if you stand on ideas and stand on the Bill of Rights and Constitution, it doesn't matter what those Judas Goats try, the people will be victorious.
[2:33:47.000 --> 2:33:52.000]  And I'm telling you, Glenn Beck's already established in the back dozens of times he's going to do it again.
[2:33:52.000 --> 2:33:55.000]  And they're building him up as the leader.
[2:33:55.000 --> 2:33:56.000]  And that's very dangerous.
[2:33:56.000 --> 2:33:58.000]  That's why I reached out to him in the last hour.
[2:33:58.000 --> 2:34:05.000]  Paul Watson's doing a detailed report either tonight or tomorrow on that subject, my public letter to Glenn Beck.
[2:34:05.000 --> 2:34:09.000]  He's encapsulating the points I made.
[2:34:09.000 --> 2:34:10.000]  Talk to the caller.
[2:34:10.000 --> 2:34:11.000]  He got it confused.
[2:34:11.000 --> 2:34:14.000]  Joe Rogan must have been on my show, not on Burmese as we call Burmese in here to check.
[2:34:14.000 --> 2:34:19.000]  But you were going to bring up something else, caller, about video call-ins from listeners.
[2:34:19.000 --> 2:34:34.000]  Yes, I do want my producers to start talking to more of our guests we have on, not just Rivera and a few filmmakers we've had on, to have more people on as guests via video link for the PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[2:34:34.000 --> 2:34:35.000]  And members.
[2:34:35.000 --> 2:34:44.000]  And yes, I did think about a phone line where people can call and leave 30-second messages.
[2:34:44.000 --> 2:34:47.000]  In fact, I want to implement this now.
[2:34:47.000 --> 2:34:49.000]  Let's make it one-minute messages.
[2:34:49.000 --> 2:34:57.000]  Align people call where we can listen to the messages every day the producers can, but leave them to one minute.
[2:34:57.000 --> 2:35:05.000]  And the best rants or the best points the guys can grab 10 or 15 of those a day and have it part of the show.
[2:35:05.000 --> 2:35:08.000]  Can we implement that today?
[2:35:08.000 --> 2:35:09.000]  All right, good.
[2:35:09.000 --> 2:35:12.000]  We will launch that.
[2:35:12.000 --> 2:35:15.000]  Can we set a box up today?
[2:35:15.000 --> 2:35:16.000]  Good.
[2:35:16.000 --> 2:35:18.000]  At the end of the show, I'll give you the number.
[2:35:18.000 --> 2:35:26.000]  And then every day, no matter how many guests we've got on, we'll air at least five calls.
[2:35:26.000 --> 2:35:31.000]  So that's something exciting we're going to add.
[2:35:31.000 --> 2:35:33.000]  And you can disagree on the phone line.
[2:35:33.000 --> 2:35:34.000]  You can agree.
[2:35:34.000 --> 2:35:36.000]  You can bring up points.
[2:35:36.000 --> 2:35:40.000]  The most interesting stuff, we'll edit it together, say five minutes every day.
[2:35:40.000 --> 2:35:41.000]  How's that sound, guys?
[2:35:41.000 --> 2:35:43.000]  The five best calls.
[2:35:43.000 --> 2:35:48.000]  And then maybe we can do something like take the other better ones and have an area where we just post them on infowars.com.
[2:35:48.000 --> 2:35:50.000]  Pretty exciting, huh?
[2:35:50.000 --> 2:35:54.000]  Do something like that, you know, the daily best calls of the day.
[2:35:54.000 --> 2:35:56.000]  Okay.
[2:35:56.000 --> 2:35:59.000]  And yes, the caller, are you still there, Kevin?
[2:35:59.000 --> 2:36:00.000]  Yes, I am.
[2:36:00.000 --> 2:36:12.000]  You were talking about having prismplanet.tv members be able to open it up to a few video calls every day so people can call in on video via Skype and be on TV with us.
[2:36:12.000 --> 2:36:14.000]  Yeah.
[2:36:14.000 --> 2:36:16.000]  I think it's great.
[2:36:16.000 --> 2:36:17.000]  I think it's a great idea.
[2:36:17.000 --> 2:36:19.000]  Go ahead and tell us about it.
[2:36:19.000 --> 2:36:21.000]  Well, there's some other people that are doing it.
[2:36:21.000 --> 2:36:24.000]  I just think it'd be really interesting.
[2:36:24.000 --> 2:36:26.000]  It would increase the amount of subscriptions that you get at prismplanet.
[2:36:26.000 --> 2:36:29.000]  I think everybody should get their prismplanet memberships if they don't have one.
[2:36:29.000 --> 2:36:31.000]  It'd be a lot of fun for us.
[2:36:31.000 --> 2:36:33.000]  And I just think you guys should keep up the great work.
[2:36:33.000 --> 2:36:34.000]  Ideas are bulletproof.
[2:36:34.000 --> 2:36:36.000]  You can't change the laws of physics.
[2:36:36.000 --> 2:36:38.000]  And 9-11 was an inside job.
[2:36:38.000 --> 2:36:39.000]  All right, God bless you.
[2:36:39.000 --> 2:36:40.000]  I appreciate the call.
[2:36:40.000 --> 2:36:47.000]  And two hours and 37 minutes into this broadcast, I will take some time out to ask listeners for support today.
[2:36:47.000 --> 2:36:58.000]  And we ask you to contribute in a symbiotic fashion where you get high quality books, videos, t-shirts, the best research materials out there we found bar none.
[2:36:58.000 --> 2:37:01.000]  They're all available at infowars.com.
[2:37:01.000 --> 2:37:13.000]  Whether it's Mysterious Monuments or Codex Magic by Texmars or in-game terror storm, the Obama deception, it's all available at infowars.com via the Safe Secure Online Video Shopping Card.
[2:37:13.000 --> 2:37:19.000]  You can get some of my videos for as low as $5.95 a piece when you order multiple copies.
[2:37:19.000 --> 2:37:29.000]  Check out the Combo deals, the specials, and know that your purchase of ball caps with infowars.com or the Obama Joker t-shirts with infowars.com
[2:37:29.000 --> 2:37:41.000]  Not only support this radio show and TV show and what we're doing here with the news sites, it also gives you a great t-shirt to spread the word or a ball cap or a film to show your neighbors, to show your friend, to show your husband,
[2:37:41.000 --> 2:37:49.000]  to show your wife, to show your neighbor, to show your grandkids, to show your high school school, your high school class, your college class.
[2:37:49.000 --> 2:37:55.000]  Whether you're a professor, an instructor, or going to school, resistance is victory.
[2:37:55.000 --> 2:38:00.000]  You can also call toll free and ask about the combos and specials.
[2:38:00.000 --> 2:38:13.000]  888-253-3139-888-2533139. There's also prisonplanet.tv. 15 cents a day.
[2:38:13.000 --> 2:38:19.000]  15 cents a day. $5.95 a month. Get a yearly membership. You get three months free.
[2:38:19.000 --> 2:38:23.000]  But just look at a trial membership today. All my films in super high quality.
[2:38:23.000 --> 2:38:28.000]  Fall the Republic coming out October 21st. It'll be there first, then shipping out on DVD that day.
[2:38:28.000 --> 2:38:35.000]  My book, Paul Watson's book, a lot of other great films we've posted there, but authorized to post there.
[2:38:35.000 --> 2:38:41.000]  My live TV show every day. Posted as an archive. Watch when you want, how you want.
[2:38:41.000 --> 2:38:45.000]  The live stream of the show. The audio archives of the radio show.
[2:38:45.000 --> 2:38:51.000]  Not in 32-bit, but in 64-bit. Correct? It's 64-bit for prisonplanet. Always get the bit rates wrong.
[2:38:51.000 --> 2:38:54.000]  People are like, you said 62. It's 64, liar.
[2:38:54.000 --> 2:38:58.000]  Okay, whatever. 60 something. 64? 64, okay.
[2:38:58.000 --> 2:39:02.000]  It's a conspiracy. 64 is an encoded message of 62.
[2:39:02.000 --> 2:39:14.000]  Anyways, the point is, is that prisonplanet.tv is there and we're expanding what we're doing.
[2:39:14.000 --> 2:39:21.000]  I've been waiting three months for the city to give us permits to build our new studio.
[2:39:21.000 --> 2:39:25.000]  Maybe I should give the permit offices number up.
[2:39:25.000 --> 2:39:29.000]  I mean, I'll tell you, the government just makes me sick. You can't get contractors coming here without a permit.
[2:39:29.000 --> 2:39:33.000]  Holding me up on what I'm doing. The point is side issue.
[2:39:33.000 --> 2:39:43.000]  It comes out in three days, three and a half days. Camp FEMA that I consulted on, that I'm one of the main contributors on,
[2:39:43.000 --> 2:39:51.000]  is a out of the park documentary film. And it is available right now at infowars.com.
[2:39:51.000 --> 2:39:56.000]  Get your order in or mail to us. It's 1995, two hour film, a lot of extras.

[2:40:01.000 --> 2:40:07.000]  And the toll-free number to order it as well is 888-253-3139.
[2:40:07.000 --> 2:40:14.000]  You can also write to me at infowars at PO Box 19549, Austin, Texas, 787-60.
[2:40:14.000 --> 2:40:22.000]  And that's PO Box 19549, Austin, Texas, 787-60.
[2:40:22.000 --> 2:40:30.000]  Okay.
[2:40:30.000 --> 2:40:35.000]  I want to go back to your calls and get into the financial news. I want to do that.
[2:40:35.000 --> 2:40:42.000]  But while I'm at it plugging things that make the show possible, I'm going to tell you about Diginet.net.
[2:40:42.000 --> 2:40:51.000]  They have these great little, very inexpensive, hidden memory stick systems that you plug into your car.
[2:40:51.000 --> 2:40:58.000]  It has a hidden camera or several hidden cameras, depending on what unit you want,
[2:40:58.000 --> 2:41:02.000]  or you just hit a button in your car and it records audio and sound in high quality.
[2:41:02.000 --> 2:41:10.000]  They have for $45 to $50, depending on how many gigs it has or how many hours it can record,
[2:41:10.000 --> 2:41:14.000]  pins that everywhere else I see are $100 to $200.
[2:41:14.000 --> 2:41:19.000]  So they just have the best prices and the highest quality, tiny hidden camera systems
[2:41:19.000 --> 2:41:24.000]  that will have on record with the police or bureaucrats or anybody else
[2:41:24.000 --> 2:41:27.000]  or people starting stuff with you in parking lots, whatever.
[2:41:27.000 --> 2:41:39.000]  It's great to carry these on you. Diginet.net, D-I-G-A-N-E-T.net, Diginet.net.
[2:41:39.000 --> 2:41:43.000]  Definitely check them out today. In fact, put that back up on screen.
[2:41:43.000 --> 2:41:51.000]  I want to give folks their number as well, or 888-344-6681, 888-344-6681.
[2:41:51.000 --> 2:41:54.000]  The great part is too, you just click it and it records. It's very simple to use.
[2:41:54.000 --> 2:42:00.000]  Also, eFoodsDirect, with all the crazy talk of depression and war and food shortages,
[2:42:00.000 --> 2:42:03.000]  let's say none of that's going to happen. Let's say everything's wonderful.
[2:42:03.000 --> 2:42:05.000]  There's a 10% chance, let's say it's a lot higher than that.
[2:42:05.000 --> 2:42:11.000]  Why not have high quality, non-GMO, non-hybrid, recently packaged, high quality food
[2:42:11.000 --> 2:42:15.000]  that doesn't have MSG in it? Well, that's where I choose to get my storeable foods.
[2:42:15.000 --> 2:42:17.000]  That's where I think you should get them.
[2:42:17.000 --> 2:42:25.000]  eFoodsDirect.com, that's eFoodsDirect.com, 800-409-5633, 800-409-5633,
[2:42:25.000 --> 2:42:28.000]  or as I said, eFoodsDirect.com.
[2:42:28.000 --> 2:42:36.000]  Okay, let's now go back one minute a piece, because I've got to get into the financial news here,
[2:42:36.000 --> 2:42:41.000]  and talk to Dave in Florida. Dave, you're on the air.
[2:42:41.000 --> 2:42:43.000]  Hey, Alex, thanks for having me on.
[2:42:43.000 --> 2:42:48.000]  I've been watching the Weather Channel over the past few days. Just a quick point here.
[2:42:48.000 --> 2:42:52.000]  The Weather Channel is now having a report on where they admit that sunspots
[2:42:52.000 --> 2:42:58.000]  are causing short-term global warming, but they're saying it's only temporary.
[2:42:58.000 --> 2:43:02.000]  It's a respite from man-made global warming. As soon as the sunspots come back,
[2:43:02.000 --> 2:43:04.000]  the global warming is going to come right back on,
[2:43:04.000 --> 2:43:08.000]  and then they come on with their 10-point list of how we can change our lives for the better.
[2:43:08.000 --> 2:43:13.000]  And the founder of the Weather Channel came out who's a meteorologist and said
[2:43:13.000 --> 2:43:17.000]  it's all a huge stinking fraud. They laugh. They know it's about taxing.
[2:43:17.000 --> 2:43:22.000]  Carbon dioxide is not dirty carbon. It's not carbon. Carbon's a solid.
[2:43:22.000 --> 2:43:27.000]  Carbon dioxide's a gas, or when it's condensed to liquid, and they know that.
[2:43:27.000 --> 2:43:31.000]  And local car washes in Austin say, don't wash your car at home. It's illegal.
[2:43:31.000 --> 2:43:35.000]  It hurts the carbon footprint. Come to our car wash. We use less.
[2:43:35.000 --> 2:43:40.000]  I mean, it's just all total Soviet takeover. Go ahead.
[2:43:40.000 --> 2:43:44.000]  Yeah, they want you to go around your house and unplug all your devices now
[2:43:44.000 --> 2:43:46.000]  and plug your TV when you're not watching.
[2:43:46.000 --> 2:43:49.000]  And they're going to make that a crime. They're going to make that a crime,
[2:43:49.000 --> 2:43:52.000]  and you're going to have monthly home inspections.
[2:43:52.000 --> 2:43:55.000]  Yeah, another point here I just wanted to bring up here.
[2:43:55.000 --> 2:43:58.000]  This is something just a question for you, actually.
[2:43:58.000 --> 2:44:01.000]  In regards to the fluoride in the water and everywhere else,
[2:44:01.000 --> 2:44:06.000]  have you seen any evidence to the fact that if you stop taking in the fluoride
[2:44:06.000 --> 2:44:08.000]  that the damage itself will reverse itself,
[2:44:08.000 --> 2:44:12.000]  or are you pretty much stuck with whatever you've already taken into your body over the years?
[2:44:12.000 --> 2:44:15.000]  Okay, I'm not a medical doctor or a toxicologist,
[2:44:15.000 --> 2:44:22.000]  but I've interviewed the head toxicologist for the EPA who got over 90% of their scientist
[2:44:22.000 --> 2:44:25.000]  to sign a letter saying, take this out of the water.
[2:44:25.000 --> 2:44:28.000]  We had him on last year, but we should have him back on.
[2:44:28.000 --> 2:44:32.000]  He's the head toxicologist and the head of the EPA Union.
[2:44:32.000 --> 2:44:36.000]  Because he said, yeah, 20 years ago in school,
[2:44:36.000 --> 2:44:38.000]  I was for calcium fluoride in the water a little bit.
[2:44:38.000 --> 2:44:40.000]  That's good for your teeth and bones.
[2:44:40.000 --> 2:44:43.000]  I didn't know that it wasn't just sodium fluoride that's deadly poison.
[2:44:43.000 --> 2:44:47.000]  It's a catch-all term for, depending on the system,
[2:44:47.000 --> 2:44:50.000]  130 to over 300 chemicals.
[2:44:50.000 --> 2:44:54.000]  Austin, it's hundreds and hundreds.
[2:44:54.000 --> 2:45:00.000]  And they take the toxic waste from nuclear weapons production,
[2:45:00.000 --> 2:45:03.000]  from fertilizer production, and from aluminum production,
[2:45:03.000 --> 2:45:05.000]  and they dump it right in your water.
[2:45:05.000 --> 2:45:11.000]  And fluoride poisoning is cumulative.
[2:45:11.000 --> 2:45:16.000]  And it precipitates in the bones and glands.
[2:45:16.000 --> 2:45:19.000]  It's proven to cause hundreds of cancers.
[2:45:19.000 --> 2:45:21.000]  Just right now in front of everybody.
[2:45:21.000 --> 2:45:25.000]  Startpage.com, search it out, folks, or Google or whatever.
[2:45:25.000 --> 2:45:31.000]  You can go to it and type in fluoride cancer.
[2:45:31.000 --> 2:45:33.000]  And it's just absolutely admitted.
[2:45:33.000 --> 2:45:37.000]  But that's just sodium fluoride, not the catch-all term, even worse.
[2:45:37.000 --> 2:45:44.000]  They know that if you get off of it, it reverses some of the damage,
[2:45:44.000 --> 2:45:46.000]  because the cumulative gets worse and worse,
[2:45:46.000 --> 2:45:48.000]  and some of it reverses, but not all of it.
[2:45:48.000 --> 2:45:53.000]  And it depends on the host organism and other your age and how long you're on it.
[2:45:53.000 --> 2:46:00.000]  They know that fluoride has double the effects on the young developing brains.
[2:46:00.000 --> 2:46:03.000]  That's why it says fluoride just for babies at all the grocery stores,
[2:46:03.000 --> 2:46:06.000]  and the mothers buy it greedily with pleasure,
[2:46:06.000 --> 2:46:08.000]  and wonder why their kids completely brain-dead,
[2:46:08.000 --> 2:46:11.000]  drooling in the corner, watching TV,
[2:46:11.000 --> 2:46:15.000]  because they love their children and 80-plus percent of advertising targets women,
[2:46:15.000 --> 2:46:18.000]  because they're trusting, they're not stupid.
[2:46:18.000 --> 2:46:21.000]  They're just trusting of anything that's in their environment.
[2:46:21.000 --> 2:46:22.000]  They're not trusting of men.
[2:46:22.000 --> 2:46:23.000]  They've been taught to not trust men,
[2:46:23.000 --> 2:46:26.000]  but they trust the new world order technocrat men.
[2:46:26.000 --> 2:46:28.000]  And before their baby, they do it,
[2:46:28.000 --> 2:46:30.000]  even though the American Medical Association,
[2:46:30.000 --> 2:46:32.000]  American Dental Association, for three years have said,
[2:46:32.000 --> 2:46:34.000]  don't give babies fluoride water.
[2:46:34.000 --> 2:46:35.000]  Don't give them toothpaste.
[2:46:35.000 --> 2:46:39.000]  It causes cancer and bone fractures and dental fluorosis.
[2:46:39.000 --> 2:46:41.000]  The mothers don't care.
[2:46:41.000 --> 2:46:45.000]  They put levels, conservatively from the reports I've read,
[2:46:45.000 --> 2:46:51.000]  a hundred times stronger in the fluoride water for kids
[2:46:51.000 --> 2:46:54.000]  than what is in the water, one part per million.
[2:46:54.000 --> 2:46:56.000]  They put mega-brain damaging,
[2:46:56.000 --> 2:47:00.000]  and those mothers give them Pedialyte with Aspartame with pleasure.
[2:47:00.000 --> 2:47:03.000]  They give them the convulsions, the brain damage.
[2:47:03.000 --> 2:47:05.000]  It's a religion to do it.
[2:47:05.000 --> 2:47:08.000]  It's a sick, moon-chousin by proxy
[2:47:08.000 --> 2:47:10.000]  that the whole government does to children with pleasure.
[2:47:10.000 --> 2:47:12.000]  Does that answer your question?
[2:47:12.000 --> 2:47:16.000]  Yeah, thanks very much, Alex.
[2:47:16.000 --> 2:47:18.000]  And they love it.
[2:47:18.000 --> 2:47:19.000]  Oh, there's Reuters.
[2:47:19.000 --> 2:47:21.000]  Another study links fluoride to bone cancer.
[2:47:21.000 --> 2:47:22.000]  Oh, would you like more?
[2:47:22.000 --> 2:47:23.000]  Would you like to see more?
[2:47:23.000 --> 2:47:28.000]  We could just go for hours with these studies.
[2:47:28.000 --> 2:47:30.000]  Oh, I'm not playing games.
[2:47:30.000 --> 2:47:35.000]  I mean, we have just been incrementally eased into the warm water,
[2:47:35.000 --> 2:47:37.000]  and then they turn the scalding water on,
[2:47:37.000 --> 2:47:41.000]  and we're just boiling, and they're going there, there, there.
[2:47:41.000 --> 2:47:42.000]  You drink your water.
[2:47:42.000 --> 2:47:47.000]  Yes, your testicles are shriveling up.
[2:47:47.000 --> 2:47:52.000]  Oh, suddenly the male sperm counts down by 87%.
[2:47:52.000 --> 2:47:55.000]  Oh, London Guardian.
[2:47:55.000 --> 2:47:57.000]  Fluoride water causes cancer,
[2:47:57.000 --> 2:48:01.000]  especially in boys' testicles and bones.
[2:48:01.000 --> 2:48:05.000]  Oh, we wonder why the boys are like girls now,
[2:48:05.000 --> 2:48:09.000]  the chemical weapon hit their fast-growing cells,
[2:48:09.000 --> 2:48:12.000]  and nothing grows faster than sperm.
[2:48:12.000 --> 2:48:15.000]  But you produce millions of a month,
[2:48:15.000 --> 2:48:17.000]  but now they don't have tails,
[2:48:17.000 --> 2:48:19.000]  and now they can't swim.
[2:48:19.000 --> 2:48:23.000]  The chemical weapon did good.
[2:48:23.000 --> 2:48:27.000]  The military and police and the boys that planted the bombs in the towers.
[2:48:27.000 --> 2:48:31.000]  Did the government tell you not to feed your kids fluoride?
[2:48:31.000 --> 2:48:34.000]  Did the government tell you not to take the mercury shots?
[2:48:34.000 --> 2:48:36.000]  Oh, you didn't get a warning.
[2:48:36.000 --> 2:48:38.000]  You're being soft killed.
[2:48:38.000 --> 2:48:41.000]  But at least you had the power to blow up those towers.
[2:48:41.000 --> 2:48:45.000]  You little pyromaniac bomb bugs.
[2:48:45.000 --> 2:48:46.000]  And so you don't care.
[2:48:46.000 --> 2:48:47.000]  It's kind of fun.
[2:48:47.000 --> 2:48:49.000]  Your masters are killing you.
[2:48:49.000 --> 2:48:50.000]  It's kind of fun.
[2:48:50.000 --> 2:48:51.000]  Yeah, you like it.
[2:48:51.000 --> 2:48:54.000]  At least it's nasty and feels good, huh?
[2:48:54.000 --> 2:48:56.000]  Feels good.
[2:48:56.000 --> 2:48:57.000]  Feels good, doesn't it?
[2:48:57.000 --> 2:49:00.000]  Feels good to have that five-year-old that's retarded,
[2:49:00.000 --> 2:49:03.000]  even though they don't have any chromosome problems.
[2:49:03.000 --> 2:49:04.000]  Feels good.
[2:49:04.000 --> 2:49:06.000]  Everybody around you is semi-retarded now.
[2:49:06.000 --> 2:49:08.000]  Feels good, doesn't it?
[2:49:08.000 --> 2:49:10.000]  Yeah, it feels good.
[2:49:10.000 --> 2:49:11.000]  Death feels good for you.
[2:49:11.000 --> 2:49:12.000]  Don't worry.
[2:49:12.000 --> 2:49:17.000]  Death will come soon enough for all of us.
[2:49:17.000 --> 2:49:22.000]  I mean, I can't even hardly do this show anymore.
[2:49:22.000 --> 2:49:24.000]  It's not that I don't want to fight.
[2:49:24.000 --> 2:49:26.000]  It's not that it's not a great honor to fight.
[2:49:26.000 --> 2:49:31.000]  It's that it's so ridiculously obvious.
[2:49:31.000 --> 2:49:38.000]  This whole world government is just out in the open.
[2:49:38.000 --> 2:49:41.000]  And I know I don't even do the best job exposing it.
[2:49:41.000 --> 2:49:43.000]  Where are all you clean-cut yuppies?
[2:49:43.000 --> 2:49:47.000]  I see riding up 360, up hills, perfect shape,
[2:49:47.000 --> 2:49:50.000]  getting out of the hiking bike trail out of your brand new BMWs.
[2:49:50.000 --> 2:49:51.000]  Your cars are totally clean.
[2:49:51.000 --> 2:49:53.000]  You're totally well-spoken.
[2:49:53.000 --> 2:49:55.000]  You've got your crap together.
[2:49:55.000 --> 2:49:57.000]  Your wife looks absolutely perfect.
[2:49:57.000 --> 2:50:00.000]  Your kids are all well-behaved.
[2:50:00.000 --> 2:50:02.000]  Why don't you care enough to find out about all this?
[2:50:02.000 --> 2:50:10.000]  Because you socially, it's not kosher to talk about this.
[2:50:10.000 --> 2:50:12.000]  And so you go along with it.
[2:50:12.000 --> 2:50:14.000]  But you drink filtered water.
[2:50:14.000 --> 2:50:16.000]  You eat non-GMO.
[2:50:16.000 --> 2:50:18.000]  And I talk to these yuppies and they kind of go,
[2:50:18.000 --> 2:50:21.000]  yeah, but the underclass is always eating poison.
[2:50:21.000 --> 2:50:25.000]  They're just kind of like they're part of the system.
[2:50:25.000 --> 2:50:27.000]  Where is your humanity?
[2:50:27.000 --> 2:50:29.000]  Where is your humanity?
[2:50:29.000 --> 2:50:34.000]  You can't just ride off humanity and then not write yourself off.
[2:50:34.000 --> 2:50:37.000]  Don't you understand that when you become a servant,
[2:50:37.000 --> 2:50:40.000]  and none of us are perfect, I'm not on some high horse here,
[2:50:40.000 --> 2:50:48.000]  that when you supplicate your will into the greater stream of human species development,
[2:50:48.000 --> 2:50:53.000]  that you unlock things in your mind and soul and become truly human.
[2:50:53.000 --> 2:50:58.000]  I'm just sad for you that you're not taking part in humanity's struggle
[2:50:58.000 --> 2:51:00.000]  to be free.
[2:51:00.000 --> 2:51:02.000]  We are at that crossroads.
[2:51:02.000 --> 2:51:05.000]  With food prices soaring to all time highs,
[2:51:05.000 --> 2:51:07.000]  as the dollar continues to fall in value,
[2:51:07.000 --> 2:51:11.000]  what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables
[2:51:11.000 --> 2:51:13.000]  will make it to your dinner table?
[2:51:13.000 --> 2:51:14.000]  Garden in a can.

[2:52:01.000 --> 2:52:08.000]  It's year after a year in production and traveling to distant lands,
[2:52:08.000 --> 2:52:10.000]  my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[2:52:10.000 --> 2:52:15.000]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks
[2:52:15.000 --> 2:52:18.000]  against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[2:52:18.000 --> 2:52:22.000]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job,
[2:52:22.000 --> 2:52:26.000]  but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[2:52:26.000 --> 2:52:29.000]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran,
[2:52:29.000 --> 2:52:35.000]  a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture,
[2:52:35.000 --> 2:52:38.000]  the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[2:52:38.000 --> 2:52:42.000]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[2:52:42.000 --> 2:52:44.000]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[2:52:44.000 --> 2:52:49.000]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[2:54:01.000 --> 2:54:17.000]  We are being forcibly medicated with the food supply and water supply.
[2:54:17.000 --> 2:54:19.000]  It's now been declassified.
[2:54:19.000 --> 2:54:25.000]  They are chemtrailing us and terraforming the planet, geoengineering it.
[2:54:25.000 --> 2:54:28.000]  God only knows what else we're not aware of.
[2:54:28.000 --> 2:54:33.000]  The top genetic engineers we've had on have confirmed that they are adding sterilants
[2:54:33.000 --> 2:54:41.000]  through the genetic makeup of the cross species food crops we're eating.
[2:54:41.000 --> 2:54:44.000]  And we can't even come together as the people against the New World Order.
[2:54:44.000 --> 2:54:55.000]  We're just going to let these people do this to us and write textbooks about how they're doing it.
[2:54:55.000 --> 2:54:57.000]  They're assaulting your children.
[2:54:57.000 --> 2:55:00.000]  They're assaulting you.
[2:55:00.000 --> 2:55:03.000]  People thank me for fighting and thank me for being involved.
[2:55:03.000 --> 2:55:05.000]  Why are you thanking me?
[2:55:05.000 --> 2:55:16.000]  It's completely normal to stand up and do whatever you can to fight against the tyranny.
[2:55:16.000 --> 2:55:21.000]  And I've never seen a tyranny this wicked, this systematic.
[2:55:21.000 --> 2:55:27.000]  Let's go back to calls and then coming up at 8 after I'm going directly into the financial analysis and this is important.
[2:55:27.000 --> 2:55:31.000]  Let's go ahead and talk to Sandy in Utah.
[2:55:31.000 --> 2:55:33.000]  Sandy, you're on the air.
[2:55:33.000 --> 2:55:34.000]  Hi, Alex.
[2:55:34.000 --> 2:55:36.000]  It's good to talk to you.
[2:55:36.000 --> 2:55:38.000]  It's good to talk to you.
[2:55:38.000 --> 2:55:42.000]  I want you to know I really appreciate you and Charlie.
[2:55:42.000 --> 2:55:43.000]  I appreciate you.
[2:55:43.000 --> 2:55:48.000]  And I have gotten a lot of your movies and things and I've given them out to people to watch.
[2:55:48.000 --> 2:55:53.000]  And I also just wanted to talk about a couple of things.
[2:55:53.000 --> 2:56:06.000]  First off, my son went into the Marines in the early 90s and he took that arms survey.
[2:56:06.000 --> 2:56:16.000]  And he put on there, he didn't agree with anything about the U.N. and on that last question, he indicated, he said to them,
[2:56:16.000 --> 2:56:20.000]  hell no, I will join with the U.S. citizens.
[2:56:20.000 --> 2:56:22.000]  I will not take their guns away.
[2:56:22.000 --> 2:56:26.000]  And for those that don't know, they gave Marines, now they give them publicly surveys.
[2:56:26.000 --> 2:56:29.000]  Will you fire on Americans under Northcom?
[2:56:29.000 --> 2:56:30.000]  Now they're getting ready for it.
[2:56:30.000 --> 2:56:31.000]  Your son said no.
[2:56:31.000 --> 2:56:34.000]  Okay, go ahead.
[2:56:34.000 --> 2:56:37.000]  Shortly after that, he received a bunch of vaccinations.
[2:56:37.000 --> 2:56:40.000]  Shortly after that, he became ill.
[2:56:40.000 --> 2:56:46.000]  So they gave him a medical discharge and I believe, of course, that they were trying to weed out all those that would stay true.
[2:56:46.000 --> 2:56:48.000]  No, no, no, we've confirmed.
[2:56:48.000 --> 2:56:55.000]  They give soft kill, this is confirmed, soft kill shots to people, to the 75 percent.
[2:56:55.000 --> 2:56:59.000]  And it usually is meant to kick in about five years after you're out.
[2:56:59.000 --> 2:57:05.000]  Because then as Homeland Security says, the number one threat to their new world order, Homeland Security is here for the corporate criminal takeover.
[2:57:05.000 --> 2:57:10.000]  They're the criminal enforcer to take care of the gang raping of America.
[2:57:10.000 --> 2:57:13.000]  Their number one threat is returning vets and gun owners.
[2:57:13.000 --> 2:57:20.000]  And that's what they're training the Boy Scouts for, to take on the veterans, the new Hitler youth.
[2:57:20.000 --> 2:57:24.000]  And God, I'm sorry they did that to your son.
[2:57:24.000 --> 2:57:29.000]  You know, there's some detoxes he can do, some other things he can do.
[2:57:29.000 --> 2:57:35.000]  Yeah, he's been using a lot of different herbs and things, but he's battled this thing ever since then.
[2:57:35.000 --> 2:57:38.000]  What's he have, like arthritis and things?
[2:57:38.000 --> 2:57:41.000]  Well, it's colitis is what it is.
[2:57:41.000 --> 2:57:49.000]  Yeah, a lot of times it attacks a Crohn's-like type diseases, totally confirmed it attacks the entire intestine.
[2:57:49.000 --> 2:57:50.000]  Yeah, it does.
[2:57:50.000 --> 2:57:53.000]  But he's been really, he's a brilliant kid.
[2:57:53.000 --> 2:57:59.000]  He's studied the militaries of all the countries and he knows, he knows a lot.
[2:57:59.000 --> 2:58:02.000]  Anyway, he's a year younger than you, Alex.
[2:58:02.000 --> 2:58:11.000]  And the other thing is, well, back then too, just before he went into the Marines,
[2:58:11.000 --> 2:58:17.000]  they told our kids in the eighth and eleventh grade that they had to have vaccines.
[2:58:17.000 --> 2:58:23.000]  And so we called the superintendent up and we said, okay, what are the vaccines for?
[2:58:23.000 --> 2:58:24.000]  What's in them?
[2:58:24.000 --> 2:58:26.000]  And why do they have to have them?
[2:58:26.000 --> 2:58:32.000]  And his reply was, well, the government told me to do it.
[2:58:32.000 --> 2:58:37.000]  And we said, well, don't you think you better be finding out?
[2:58:37.000 --> 2:58:48.000]  Tell me more about how that ended when we come back in 70 seconds.
[2:59:07.000 --> 2:59:12.000]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[2:59:12.000 --> 2:59:16.000]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[2:59:16.000 --> 2:59:18.000]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[2:59:18.000 --> 2:59:22.000]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[2:59:22.000 --> 2:59:25.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages.
[2:59:25.000 --> 2:59:30.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[2:59:30.000 --> 2:59:34.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[2:59:34.000 --> 2:59:36.000]  a long time sponsor of ours.
[2:59:36.000 --> 2:59:40.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[2:59:40.000 --> 2:59:42.000]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[2:59:42.000 --> 2:59:45.000]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.
[2:59:45.000 --> 2:59:54.000]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call toll-free 877-327-0365.
[2:59:54.000 --> 2:59:56.000]  Waging war on corruption.
[2:59:56.000 --> 3:00:14.000]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:00:14.000 --> 3:00:16.000]  We're going to take a few more calls right now.
[3:00:16.000 --> 3:00:22.000]  And at the eight after, I'm going to spend a couple of segments breaking down the financial reform legislation
[3:00:22.000 --> 3:00:26.000]  that Obama is pushing and how that fits into this whole world government system.
[3:00:26.000 --> 3:00:30.000]  And all the headlines we've been seeing about UN once,
[3:00:30.000 --> 3:00:33.000]  New World Reserve currency to replace the dollar.
[3:00:33.000 --> 3:00:36.000]  Remember that headline last week?
[3:00:36.000 --> 3:00:39.000]  We're going to be going over all of that coming up.
[3:00:39.000 --> 3:00:43.000]  But Sandy, Chris, Josh, Ryan, others were going to get to you as well.
[3:00:43.000 --> 3:00:48.000]  Sandy, so they ended up getting your son later with the vaccines in the military.
[3:00:48.000 --> 3:00:50.000]  But in school, they said, we don't know what it is.
[3:00:50.000 --> 3:00:52.000]  The government just says you've got to take these shots.
[3:00:52.000 --> 3:00:54.000]  How did that end?
[3:00:54.000 --> 3:00:59.000]  The eighth and eleventh graders had to get these shots because the government said so.
[3:00:59.000 --> 3:01:02.000]  Well, we said, well, our kids aren't getting them.
[3:01:02.000 --> 3:01:07.000]  So we went and got some waivers for them and we made copies.
[3:01:07.000 --> 3:01:10.000]  And so they didn't get them, you know, at the time.
[3:01:10.000 --> 3:01:15.000]  But I know I've never cared for vaccines for a long time.
[3:01:15.000 --> 3:01:21.000]  And I, at the age of 11 and a half when Jeff Kay was killed,
[3:01:21.000 --> 3:01:24.000]  I knew I wasn't getting the truth.
[3:01:24.000 --> 3:01:27.000]  And I was determined to find out what it was.
[3:01:27.000 --> 3:01:29.000]  And I did.
[3:01:29.000 --> 3:01:35.000]  The other thing is I was watching Glenn Beck the other day on Saturday.
[3:01:35.000 --> 3:01:38.000]  And they were switching back and forth.
[3:01:38.000 --> 3:01:42.000]  And they switched to him at one point.
[3:01:42.000 --> 3:01:46.000]  And it looked to me like he was in a trance.
[3:01:46.000 --> 3:01:48.000]  And it hit me.
[3:01:48.000 --> 3:01:51.000]  I thought he has been hypnotized.
[3:01:51.000 --> 3:01:55.000]  And he's probably on psychotropic drugs.
[3:01:55.000 --> 3:02:01.000]  And I think that he joined the Mormon Church to bring them down.
[3:02:01.000 --> 3:02:05.000]  And he's, I got a message for him.
[3:02:05.000 --> 3:02:09.000]  If he thinks he's going to bring down the Patriots in America,
[3:02:09.000 --> 3:02:15.000]  the Mormon Church is got another thing coming because he will have to face the Lord.
[3:02:15.000 --> 3:02:18.000]  All right, Sandy, I appreciate your call.
[3:02:18.000 --> 3:02:20.000]  You know, he's, he does act.
[3:02:20.000 --> 3:02:24.000]  I mean, I, everybody screws around and has some fun when you do a long show every day.
[3:02:24.000 --> 3:02:30.000]  But he constantly just acts crazy and goofy and fruity.
[3:02:30.000 --> 3:02:32.000]  And he's not like a George Washington.
[3:02:32.000 --> 3:02:38.000]  I mean, he just is really creepy.
[3:02:38.000 --> 3:02:41.000]  And he's bad news.
[3:02:41.000 --> 3:02:43.000]  Look, I care about my children's future.
[3:02:43.000 --> 3:02:46.000]  I'm not here bashing him because, you know, he's a bigger talk show host than me.
[3:02:46.000 --> 3:02:51.000]  And I don't like it because so many people do that to me.
[3:02:51.000 --> 3:02:59.000]  That I almost don't like to talk about about Beck or anybody else because it like lowers you to do that.
[3:02:59.000 --> 3:03:05.000]  But you've got to talk about Beck because he just such bad news.
[3:03:05.000 --> 3:03:07.000]  Let's take another call here.
[3:03:07.000 --> 3:03:11.000]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chris in California.
[3:03:11.000 --> 3:03:12.000]  Chris, welcome.
[3:03:12.000 --> 3:03:13.000]  Thanks.
[3:03:13.000 --> 3:03:18.000]  I was just calling because I completely agree with your assessment about going back.
[3:03:18.000 --> 3:03:23.000]  It's like, because he comes off like, like how Stephen Colbert does it, his character.
[3:03:23.000 --> 3:03:26.000]  But he, he's like serious about it.
[3:03:26.000 --> 3:03:28.000]  And he's crying and stuff.
[3:03:28.000 --> 3:03:30.000]  And he's bringing like real facts.
[3:03:30.000 --> 3:03:32.000]  But he's, you know, you know, like his past.
[3:03:32.000 --> 3:03:34.000]  So it's like, well, it's meant to discredit it.
[3:03:34.000 --> 3:03:40.000]  I mean, look at how he supported the banker bailout bill and then says he's fighting the New World Order.
[3:03:40.000 --> 3:03:45.000]  And then he said, arrest Ron Paul supporters when Ron Paul had a chance to win.
[3:03:45.000 --> 3:03:49.000]  So see, he shows who he is right when we're getting headway.
[3:03:49.000 --> 3:03:51.000]  He'll go, there's no FEMA camps.
[3:03:51.000 --> 3:03:53.000]  There's no government corruption.
[3:03:53.000 --> 3:03:55.000]  We need to support the Patriot Act.
[3:03:55.000 --> 3:03:57.000]  We need to arrest Ron Paul supporters.
[3:03:57.000 --> 3:03:59.000]  Ron Paul's dangerous.
[3:03:59.000 --> 3:04:02.000]  Oh, we need this banker bailout bill.
[3:04:02.000 --> 3:04:06.000]  I mean, with friends like this, who needs enemies?
[3:04:06.000 --> 3:04:08.000]  Yeah.
[3:04:08.000 --> 3:04:11.000]  And also, it's the same thing with Barack Obama.
[3:04:11.000 --> 3:04:13.000]  Except where he's playing the role.
[3:04:13.000 --> 3:04:18.000]  Like when he talks, he, to me, he reminds me of a preacher, like a black preacher or something like that.
[3:04:18.000 --> 3:04:21.000]  When, when he talks, when he gives a speech, it's more like he's preaching.
[3:04:21.000 --> 3:04:23.000]  That's how I get the feeling.
[3:04:23.000 --> 3:04:25.000]  It's like, it's kind of weird.
[3:04:25.000 --> 3:04:27.000]  And he's got a great voice and he's handsome and smart.
[3:04:27.000 --> 3:04:29.000]  And it's all lies.
[3:04:29.000 --> 3:04:36.000]  I mean, there's more troops in the Middle East now than there were a year ago.
[3:04:36.000 --> 3:04:38.000]  I mean, it's incredible.
[3:04:38.000 --> 3:04:40.000]  Anything else, sir?
[3:04:40.000 --> 3:04:41.000]  No, that's about it.
[3:04:41.000 --> 3:04:42.000]  Thank you.
[3:04:42.000 --> 3:04:43.000]  God bless you.
[3:04:43.000 --> 3:04:44.000]  Good to hear from you, Chris.
[3:04:44.000 --> 3:04:45.000]  All right.
[3:04:45.000 --> 3:04:47.000]  Chris in Maryland, Josh in California, Ryan in Indiana and others.
[3:04:47.000 --> 3:04:52.000]  1-800-259-9231 is the toll-free number to join us.
[3:04:52.000 --> 3:04:58.000]  And we're going to come back and break down what's really happening with the economy straight ahead on the one the only.
[3:04:58.000 --> 3:05:00.000]  G-C-N Radio Network.
[3:05:29.000 --> 3:05:32.000]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[3:05:32.000 --> 3:05:36.000]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[3:05:36.000 --> 3:05:40.000]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[3:05:40.000 --> 3:05:41.000]  How much will you need?
[3:05:41.000 --> 3:05:42.000]  We don't know.
[3:05:42.000 --> 3:05:43.000]  How much do you want?
[3:05:43.000 --> 3:05:44.000]  All you can get.
[3:05:44.000 --> 3:05:45.000]  I'm Alex Jones.
[3:05:45.000 --> 3:05:48.000]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[3:05:48.000 --> 3:05:56.000]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[3:05:56.000 --> 3:06:01.000]  And that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[3:06:01.000 --> 3:06:08.000]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[3:06:08.000 --> 3:06:10.000]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[3:06:10.000 --> 3:06:12.000]  But who is the enemy?
[3:06:12.000 --> 3:06:13.000]  Bin Laden.
[3:06:13.000 --> 3:06:14.000]  This is his MO.
[3:06:14.000 --> 3:06:15.000]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[3:06:15.000 --> 3:06:17.000]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[3:06:17.000 --> 3:06:24.000]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[3:06:24.000 --> 3:06:31.000]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[3:06:31.000 --> 3:06:35.000]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[3:06:35.000 --> 3:06:42.000]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[3:06:42.000 --> 3:06:45.000]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[3:06:45.000 --> 3:06:46.000]  Fabled Enemies.
[3:06:46.000 --> 3:06:54.000]  Get the DVD at infowars.com, or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:06:54.000 --> 3:07:23.000]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[3:07:25.000 --> 3:07:30.000]  Are you prepared for the next round of storm-related outages or government-created blackouts?
[3:07:30.000 --> 3:07:36.000]  Have you ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid and generate your own private supply of electrical power?
[3:07:36.000 --> 3:07:40.000]  If so, this will be the most important information you have ever heard.
[3:07:40.000 --> 3:07:43.000]  Solar-powered generators are finally available.
[3:07:43.000 --> 3:07:48.000]  They have no moving parts to wear out or break and require absolutely no gas whatsoever.
[3:07:48.000 --> 3:07:53.000]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com.
[3:07:53.000 --> 3:07:55.000]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[3:07:55.000 --> 3:08:01.000]  Check out mysolarbackup.com before you lose your power.
[3:08:01.000 --> 3:08:09.000]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[3:08:09.000 --> 3:08:13.000]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:08:13.000 --> 3:08:29.000]  All right, I'm going to break down the big fight we're facing that frankly dwarfs the seriousness of government-run,
[3:08:29.000 --> 3:08:33.000]  government-hijacked healthcare, 20% of the economy.
[3:08:33.000 --> 3:08:47.000]  As important as that is, it is nothing compared to open-world government run for and by a private intergroup of central banks.
[3:08:47.000 --> 3:08:48.000]  I couldn't believe it.
[3:08:48.000 --> 3:08:52.000]  I was watching CNN this morning on the treadmill and they were admitting,
[3:08:52.000 --> 3:08:59.000]  yeah, the dollar may die like Argentina and we need to have a new World Reserve currency the UN is calling for.
[3:08:59.000 --> 3:09:07.000]  Don't believe me, just Google the term UN calls for replacing the dollar with new currency.
[3:09:07.000 --> 3:09:10.000]  And you'll see AP Reuters.
[3:09:10.000 --> 3:09:14.000]  We cover that in the Obama deception that's been out for six months.
[3:09:14.000 --> 3:09:23.000]  And when we released the Obama deception, they were hot and heavy, not on the healthcare takeover, but on the banking reform.
[3:09:23.000 --> 3:09:30.000]  Now, six months ago, they'd only stolen about 10 trillion in six months.
[3:09:30.000 --> 3:09:42.000]  Now they've stolen 23.7 trillion, 23.7 trillion, 10 and a half months into the bailout.
[3:09:42.000 --> 3:09:47.000]  And look at that headline, London Telegraph, UN wants new global currency to replace dollar.
[3:09:47.000 --> 3:09:54.000]  I just want to put that up there for people that are still in denial because the media for decades called anybody a lunatic kook.
[3:09:54.000 --> 3:10:04.000]  If you read UN documents, if you read Club of Rome documents, if you read CFR documents, if you read articles out of Money magazine where they were calling for it,
[3:10:04.000 --> 3:10:05.000]  it didn't exist.
[3:10:05.000 --> 3:10:06.000]  You were a liar.
[3:10:06.000 --> 3:10:16.000]  Well, now they're announcing it on CNN and saying, look, we got to have this next banking reform or we're going to have another bubble.
[3:10:16.000 --> 3:10:19.000]  And you'll lose your 401k.
[3:10:19.000 --> 3:10:21.000]  What did I tell you in the Obama deception?
[3:10:21.000 --> 3:10:25.000]  What did I tell you last year when they had the October 3rd Banker takeover?
[3:10:25.000 --> 3:10:31.000]  I said, they're going to plunge the market, pump it back up with the tens of trillions they steal.
[3:10:31.000 --> 3:10:37.000]  The banks are making record profits, but Main Street is dying.
[3:10:37.000 --> 3:10:45.000]  The layoffs, the job losses, the stores closing, the real economy Main Street is dying.
[3:10:45.000 --> 3:10:48.000]  Vertical integration is happening.
[3:10:48.000 --> 3:10:58.000]  Only a handful of central banks, there's only really seven big ones, are consolidating all the small banks, the infrastructures,
[3:10:58.000 --> 3:11:03.000]  bankrupting the states, bankrupting individuals and consolidating everything.
[3:11:03.000 --> 3:11:08.000]  And they had the financial expert on CNN this morning.
[3:11:08.000 --> 3:11:15.000]  The ball headed guy wearing a pinstriped suit, not soup.
[3:11:15.000 --> 3:11:21.000]  Whatever his name is, admitting everything but like it was good.
[3:11:21.000 --> 3:11:25.000]  Oh, the big banks are consolidating and buying everything up with the money they have and they're going to fix it.
[3:11:25.000 --> 3:11:32.000]  We're going to have a new Bank of the World and I was sitting there watching it while I was jogging and just couldn't believe it.
[3:11:32.000 --> 3:11:36.000]  So everything we told you about has now come true.
[3:11:36.000 --> 3:11:42.000]  When Obama gave his speech earlier in the first hour, we played some clips of it live, some excerpts.
[3:11:42.000 --> 3:11:53.000]  We went to it live several times and he's saying they're going to get tough on the banks and stop derivatives ever happening again.
[3:11:53.000 --> 3:12:02.000]  When in truth, Geithner was the head of the New York Fed, the real federal branch of the Private Fellow Reserve that actually has power in New York.
[3:12:02.000 --> 3:12:07.000]  Bernanke was Fed Chairman over the entire system.
[3:12:07.000 --> 3:12:17.000]  They told Bush exactly what to do and there was complete coordination between Geithner and Bernanke and Bush and then Obama.
[3:12:17.000 --> 3:12:25.000]  And then Obama appointed people even closer to the scam than Bush had had.
[3:12:25.000 --> 3:12:32.000]  But it's kind of like Obama's people are the lead bank robber and Bush was in the getaway car.
[3:12:32.000 --> 3:12:35.000]  I'm not being partisan saying who was more guilty.
[3:12:35.000 --> 3:12:42.000]  They're all total puppets robbing the bank for the mob boss down the road living in his palace.
[3:12:42.000 --> 3:12:44.000]  That's the New World Order.
[3:12:44.000 --> 3:12:49.000]  I mean, this is complete fraud.
[3:12:49.000 --> 3:12:56.000]  Complete total fraud, the exact Clinton bankers that made the rule changes.
[3:12:56.000 --> 3:13:01.000]  Bush then protected them while they were looting for eight years.
[3:13:01.000 --> 3:13:08.000]  Again, seamless integration between Clinton, Bush, Obama, totally on the same team, total coordination.
[3:13:08.000 --> 3:13:11.000]  They even testified in Congress on this.
[3:13:11.000 --> 3:13:18.000]  No difference except they knew Obama would be a better person to sell it to the American people.
[3:13:18.000 --> 3:13:26.000]  So he got four times the Wall Street Journal, the Wall Street money from Wall Street brokerage firms and banks.
[3:13:26.000 --> 3:13:31.000]  According to the Wall Street Journal, then Obama did.
[3:13:31.000 --> 3:13:37.000]  Again, Obama got four times more than McCain.
[3:13:37.000 --> 3:13:42.000]  And that was because they knew he could sell the fraud, not that McCain was good.
[3:13:42.000 --> 3:13:48.000]  They were loading an arrow in their crossbow saying which which arrow is the most vicious I've got?
[3:13:48.000 --> 3:13:50.000]  Which one will take down America the best?
[3:13:50.000 --> 3:13:52.000]  Which one can con these suckers?
[3:13:52.000 --> 3:13:53.000]  All right, this is the one.
[3:13:53.000 --> 3:13:54.000]  Let me load it.
[3:13:54.000 --> 3:13:58.000]  Oh, powerful crossbow.
[3:13:58.000 --> 3:14:01.000]  Let me load Obama into the groove.
[3:14:01.000 --> 3:14:03.000]  All right, here comes that dumbass public.
[3:14:03.000 --> 3:14:04.000]  Boom.
[3:14:04.000 --> 3:14:10.000]  And I mean, it's just like, wham, that pull up a video of a deer getting shot by a crossbow.
[3:14:10.000 --> 3:14:15.000]  You can go to YouTube and say, deer, deer hunting with crossbow.
[3:14:15.000 --> 3:14:17.000]  And the deer hunters, the New World Order.
[3:14:17.000 --> 3:14:19.000]  Obama's the arrow.
[3:14:19.000 --> 3:14:25.000]  David Rockefeller was a big new Brazinski and J. Rockefeller and the Queen of England and the Queen of the Netherlands.
[3:14:25.000 --> 3:14:26.000]  It's all a big joke to them.
[3:14:26.000 --> 3:14:28.000]  The Rothschilds as well.
[3:14:28.000 --> 3:14:30.000]  They are the hunter.
[3:14:30.000 --> 3:14:33.000]  And they got a crossbow that's our government.
[3:14:33.000 --> 3:14:38.000]  They've built the government to be big and powerful to be able to knock the Republic down.
[3:14:38.000 --> 3:14:41.000]  And they load a bush in and they shoot it into us.
[3:14:41.000 --> 3:14:43.000]  They load an Obama in.
[3:14:43.000 --> 3:14:46.000]  That's all they are is a weapon.
[3:14:46.000 --> 3:14:54.000]  But before we go to that, I wanted to play a short clip of Glenn Beck endorsing the banker bailout bill.
[3:14:54.000 --> 3:14:56.000]  Here it is.
[3:14:56.000 --> 3:14:58.000]  I think the bailout is the right thing to do.
[3:14:58.000 --> 3:15:00.000]  I believe so deeply in our Constitution.
[3:15:00.000 --> 3:15:02.000]  I was for the Patriot Act.
[3:15:02.000 --> 3:15:12.000]  You know that I am actually a libertarian at heart. The $700 billion that you're hearing about now is not only utterly necessary.
[3:15:12.000 --> 3:15:15.000]  It is also not nearly enough.
[3:15:15.000 --> 3:15:18.000]  There was one guy last year that was Ron Paul.
[3:15:18.000 --> 3:15:20.000]  And then he demonizes Ron Paul.
[3:15:20.000 --> 3:15:21.000]  That's enough.
[3:15:21.000 --> 3:15:23.000]  There's nothing worse than two faces.
[3:15:23.000 --> 3:15:26.000]  So, there's your savior that's leading your movement.
[3:15:26.000 --> 3:15:30.000]  They've put him there and made him the leader so he can lead you off.
[3:15:30.000 --> 3:15:32.000]  Is the point.
[3:15:32.000 --> 3:15:38.000]  Now, let's play somebody from Fox who they keep in the basement on internet TV.
[3:15:38.000 --> 3:15:40.000]  And most of the public is so dumbed down.
[3:15:40.000 --> 3:15:42.000]  They don't know this is internet only.
[3:15:42.000 --> 3:15:44.000]  I've been on a show once.
[3:15:44.000 --> 3:15:46.000]  Not again, even though he liked it.
[3:15:46.000 --> 3:15:48.000]  I know the higher ups put the kibosh on that.
[3:15:48.000 --> 3:15:50.000]  But it doesn't matter.
[3:15:50.000 --> 3:15:58.000]  The point is, Judge Napolitano, he's not perfect, but he is definitely not a Benedict Arnold.
[3:15:58.000 --> 3:16:00.000]  Now, what did he say about the bailout?
[3:16:00.000 --> 3:16:05.000]  And more importantly, Obama's new regulatory reform.
[3:16:05.000 --> 3:16:10.000]  He said this a few months ago, literally a week after we published this article,
[3:16:10.000 --> 3:16:17.000]  Obama regulatory reform plan officially establishes banking dictatorship in the United States.
[3:16:17.000 --> 3:16:21.000]  And I said from a hot dog stand to a car dealership,
[3:16:21.000 --> 3:16:34.000]  it states in the legislation Obama introduced that the private banking consortium gives the Federal Reserve control over every facet of the economy.
[3:16:34.000 --> 3:16:36.000]  That's what the bill read.
[3:16:36.000 --> 3:16:40.000]  Now, Napolitano told the truth.
[3:16:40.000 --> 3:16:44.000]  And here is that piece.
[3:16:44.000 --> 3:16:53.000]  I'm Judge Andrew Napolitano, and the verdict is coming on President Barack Obama's historic plan to overhaul and regulate our financial institutions.
[3:16:53.000 --> 3:16:55.000]  Here's the question.
[3:16:55.000 --> 3:17:01.000]  What is left out of this proposal is, and what we deserve to know is, who will regulate the Federal Reserve?
[3:17:01.000 --> 3:17:08.000]  What will become of clauses in the Constitution that prohibit the very type of regulation the President wants?
[3:17:08.000 --> 3:17:13.000]  And what is now the meaning of the word free in free market?
[3:17:13.000 --> 3:17:15.000]  Here are the facts.
[3:17:15.000 --> 3:17:19.000]  The bias of the drafters of this proposal is that the government knows best.
[3:17:19.000 --> 3:17:24.000]  The Constitution should not be an obstacle to the egalitarian goals of the government,
[3:17:24.000 --> 3:17:29.000]  and no private behavior is beyond the government's reach of its huge hand.
[3:17:29.000 --> 3:17:38.000]  The essence of the proposal is to give the Federal Reserve the authority to regulate any aspect of any firms that in its discretion,
[3:17:38.000 --> 3:17:42.000]  its sole discretion, could adversely affect the economy if they fail.
[3:17:42.000 --> 3:17:48.000]  The Fed would thus be the only unregulated private entity on the planet.
[3:17:48.000 --> 3:17:57.000]  This private, super secret bank, half of whose board is appointed by the President, is the most secret aspect in all of the government.
[3:17:57.000 --> 3:17:58.000]  Think about it.
[3:17:58.000 --> 3:18:03.000]  The job of the CIA is to steal and to keep secrets.
[3:18:03.000 --> 3:18:07.000]  But we know more about the CIA than we do the Federal Reserve.
[3:18:07.000 --> 3:18:18.000]  The Federal Reserve is a private, completely unregulated bank into which the Obama Administration proposes to repose all regulatory authority,
[3:18:18.000 --> 3:18:25.000]  from the compensation of executives to the investments companies make to the location of their franchises,
[3:18:25.000 --> 3:18:30.000]  are you ready for this, to the amount of fat in McDonald's cheeseburgers,
[3:18:30.000 --> 3:18:35.000]  without appeal and without stating reasons for the regulations.
[3:18:35.000 --> 3:18:40.000]  All grouped investments, even if the investors own the group like hedge funds,
[3:18:40.000 --> 3:18:46.000]  like you and your neighbors getting together to buy a house, will be subject to the Fed's new rules.
[3:18:46.000 --> 3:18:49.000]  All state chartered banks will now be subject to the Fed.
[3:18:49.000 --> 3:18:58.000]  All businesses, whether financial in nature or not, that are owned by any financial institutions, shall be subject to the Fed.
[3:18:58.000 --> 3:19:05.000]  Even mom and pop shops and stores, if in the Fed's opinion could fail,
[3:19:05.000 --> 3:19:12.000]  and thus produce systemic harm to the economy, shall be subject to the rule of the Fed.
[3:19:12.000 --> 3:19:22.000]  The Fed shall have the authority to require lawyers and accountants to report data to the Fed, but even the IRS presently lacks.
[3:19:22.000 --> 3:19:32.000]  There appears to be no limit to the private human behavior that the Fed will not be able to find a way to regulate under this proposal.
[3:19:32.000 --> 3:19:35.000]  If you want to hear more of opinions such as these...
[3:19:35.000 --> 3:19:38.000]  Alright folks, that is the clip.
[3:19:38.000 --> 3:19:40.000]  Now we're going to come back and give you the full magnitude.
[3:19:40.000 --> 3:19:44.000]  It's worse than even he's saying, because if you take a bank loan,
[3:19:44.000 --> 3:19:49.000]  they're going to say you're under federal control of a private bank.
[3:19:49.000 --> 3:19:53.000]  This is Total Dictatorship by the Offshore Bankers.
[3:20:19.000 --> 3:20:30.000]  You will receive seeds to grow tomatoes, carrots, beans, broccoli, cucumbers, peppers, onions, cabbage, lettuce, pumpkins, spinach, peas, wheatgrass, and much more.
[3:20:30.000 --> 3:20:31.000]  And the best part?
[3:20:31.000 --> 3:20:37.000]  You will receive almost 6,000 seeds that you can save and replant each season for only $79.
[3:20:37.000 --> 3:20:42.000]  This means that these vegetables will only cost you about one penny for each one you grow.
[3:20:42.000 --> 3:20:47.000]  And in this economy, saving money is always welcome, especially when it comes to our food supply.

[3:21:02.000 --> 3:21:07.000]  May I have everybody's attention, please? I've come with a message of information.
[3:21:07.000 --> 3:21:09.000]  9-11 was an inside job.
[3:21:09.000 --> 3:21:12.000]  Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[3:21:12.000 --> 3:21:19.000]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage? Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CAF?
[3:21:19.000 --> 3:21:21.000]  We sit down and shout.
[3:21:21.000 --> 3:21:28.000]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[3:21:28.000 --> 3:21:34.000]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[3:21:34.000 --> 3:21:38.000]  An inside job? How dare you?
[3:21:38.000 --> 3:21:44.000]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[3:21:44.000 --> 3:21:47.000]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[3:21:47.000 --> 3:21:53.000]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.
[3:21:53.000 --> 3:21:59.000]  Truth rising. Download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[3:21:59.000 --> 3:22:02.000]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[3:22:02.000 --> 3:22:09.000]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind? If it's Berkey water purification systems, this message is for you.
[3:22:09.000 --> 3:22:15.000]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride, at less than 2 cents per gallon?
[3:22:15.000 --> 3:22:22.000]  Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine fluoride and contaminants from municipal water.
[3:22:22.000 --> 3:22:28.000]  These filters are powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water, making them perfect for rainwater collection systems.
[3:22:28.000 --> 3:22:33.000]  From the smallest to the largest systems, bigberkeywaterfilters.com has what you need.

[3:23:24.000 --> 3:23:32.000]  These show that liquid zeolite captures triggering antigens which cause allergies, migraines and asthma decreasing the rate and severity of these symptoms.
[3:23:32.000 --> 3:23:40.000]  Liquid zeolite is a tasteless and odorless liquid that when taken daily, supports a healthy, happy and active lifestyle in an increasingly toxic world.
[3:23:40.000 --> 3:23:44.000]  And liquid zeolite is so gentle that you won't even know you're taking it.
[3:23:44.000 --> 3:23:47.000]  Although your list of elements may be endless, the solution is simple.

[3:24:08.000 --> 3:24:10.000]  More of your calls coming up in the next segment.
[3:24:10.000 --> 3:24:17.000]  We've got Rob Dew popping in one of the producers that give us some reports on what's in the new flu shot.
[3:24:17.000 --> 3:24:27.000]  That's some more guests coming up this week and next week on that subject as they get ready to try to push forced inoculations in this country.
[3:24:27.000 --> 3:24:31.000]  But I just played what Napolitano said.
[3:24:31.000 --> 3:24:36.000]  And his producers have told me they listened to the show, they liked the show, they picked up on our analysis and went and looked at the bill.
[3:24:36.000 --> 3:24:38.000]  And we're glad they did that.
[3:24:38.000 --> 3:24:43.000]  But Glenn Beck is going to be supporting the bank or takeover bill. You better believe it.
[3:24:43.000 --> 3:24:45.000]  And that's how the media is going to phrase this.
[3:24:45.000 --> 3:24:49.000]  Look, we stopped a depression with what the banks just did.
[3:24:49.000 --> 3:24:53.000]  In truth, the banks hoarded all the money and are killing Main Street right now.
[3:24:53.000 --> 3:24:58.000]  But the banks are doing good, so they call that a good economy. The jobless recovery.
[3:24:58.000 --> 3:25:06.000]  You live in soup kitchens and you lose your job or you take a cut and pay and the bankers make trillions off your back in tax money.
[3:25:06.000 --> 3:25:09.000]  And then they set up FEMA camps. That's the new economy.
[3:25:09.000 --> 3:25:14.000]  So that's what they're pushing. That's what they're setting up.
[3:25:14.000 --> 3:25:23.000]  And they're going to say now, okay, the depression is going to get worse.
[3:25:23.000 --> 3:25:29.000]  If you don't do this, we're going to kill the economy.
[3:25:29.000 --> 3:25:36.000]  If you don't submit to us, it's like in blazing saddles where the sheriff surrounded and he says, drop your guns or I'll shoot myself.
[3:25:36.000 --> 3:25:40.000]  But they're not really going to shoot themselves. They're going to shoot our country in the head.
[3:25:40.000 --> 3:25:52.000]  These are criminals feeding on the planet. Now, this story written by Paul Watson and Steve Watson from my breakdown of the facts is key.
[3:25:52.000 --> 3:25:59.000]  Obama regulatory reform plan officially established was bank banking dictatorship in the United States.
[3:25:59.000 --> 3:26:09.000]  And I'm asking everybody to go get this article from June 18 three, four months ago and to get it out to everybody again.
[3:26:09.000 --> 3:26:13.000]  Along with the Nepolitano video that we just played.
[3:26:13.000 --> 3:26:20.000]  I'm asking everybody to go and get this so people understand what's about to happen.
[3:26:20.000 --> 3:26:27.000]  Because if the foreign offshore banks get a total dictatorial power in the country, it's going to be rough.
[3:26:27.000 --> 3:26:33.000]  Either we abolish the Fed and arrest the bankers or they're going to keep growing like a cancer.
[3:26:33.000 --> 3:26:40.000]  President Obama's plan to give the private owned and unaccountable fellow reserve complete regulatory oversight across the entire U.S. economy,
[3:26:40.000 --> 3:26:43.000]  which is likely to be enacted before the end of the year.
[3:26:43.000 --> 3:26:48.000]  Now they're trying it will officially herald the beginning of a new form of government in the United States,
[3:26:48.000 --> 3:26:55.000]  an ultra powerful banking dictatorship controlled by a small gaggle of shadowy and corrupt elitist.
[3:26:55.000 --> 3:27:04.000]  These rules would see the Fed given the authority to regulate any company whose activity it believes could threaten the economy and the markets.
[3:27:04.000 --> 3:27:07.000]  Yeah, but see this is the group threatening the markets.
[3:27:07.000 --> 3:27:09.000]  This is the group that's done this.
[3:27:09.000 --> 3:27:11.000]  This is the group that did the derivatives.
[3:27:11.000 --> 3:27:15.000]  But now they're given, oh, total power to save us.
[3:27:15.000 --> 3:27:24.000]  That goes a step further than the centrally planned economies of the Soviet Union or communist China in that the fellow reserve is not even accountable to the U.S. government.
[3:27:24.000 --> 3:27:33.000]  There's a private entity that, according to the former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, is an accountable to no one but the banking families that own it.
[3:27:33.000 --> 3:27:36.000]  And he said that on Laird NewsHour.
[3:27:36.000 --> 3:27:45.000]  Obama's regulatory reform plan is nothing less than a green light for the complete and total takeover of the United States by a private banking cartel
[3:27:45.000 --> 3:27:55.000]  that will usurp the power of existing regulatory bodies who are now being blamed within a financial crisis in order that their status can be abolished
[3:27:55.000 --> 3:27:58.000]  and their roles handed over to the all powerful Federal Reserve.
[3:27:58.000 --> 3:28:05.000]  And it goes on for page after page after page after page of detailed analysis.
[3:28:05.000 --> 3:28:13.000]  And I'm going to read a little bit more here, but the issue is either we say no to the government takeover of healthcare.
[3:28:13.000 --> 3:28:15.000]  That's just a new tax in the banks.
[3:28:15.000 --> 3:28:20.000]  They're just going to take over healthcare, water it down, take 20% of your paycheck extra.
[3:28:20.000 --> 3:28:24.000]  You're not going to get jacked crap back, okay?
[3:28:24.000 --> 3:28:25.000]  There's that.
[3:28:25.000 --> 3:28:27.000]  There's this banking takeover.
[3:28:27.000 --> 3:28:31.000]  There's the expansion of the wars.
[3:28:31.000 --> 3:28:34.000]  There's the Cybersecurity Act taking over the Internet.
[3:28:34.000 --> 3:28:42.000]  There's the Cyberbullying Act, free speech ending, hate bills past the House openly says,
[3:28:42.000 --> 3:28:45.000]  you don't even have to call for anything criminal.
[3:28:45.000 --> 3:28:46.000]  You still get arrested.
[3:28:46.000 --> 3:28:48.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's all happening.
[3:28:48.000 --> 3:28:53.000]  It's all 180 degrees away from freedom.
[3:28:53.000 --> 3:28:56.000]  In fact, cut to a close shot for me real fast right here.
[3:28:56.000 --> 3:29:00.000]  Okay, here is the political system.
[3:29:00.000 --> 3:29:05.000]  Okay, here is the political system symbolized as a circle.
[3:29:05.000 --> 3:29:10.000]  Okay.
[3:29:10.000 --> 3:29:13.000]  When we come back, I'm going to get into it for everybody.
[3:29:13.000 --> 3:29:21.000]  But here is the political system symbolized as a circle.
[3:29:21.000 --> 3:29:28.000]  And I'll show you tyranny versus liberty when we get back after this quick break on the other side.
[3:29:28.000 --> 3:29:33.000]  Again, the websites are info wars.com, prisonplanet.tv.
[3:29:33.000 --> 3:29:38.000]  And we're here live Monday through Friday from 11am to 3pm central.
[3:29:38.000 --> 3:29:41.000]  We don't have the big New World Order media promoting us.
[3:29:41.000 --> 3:29:45.000]  We reach new listeners one person at a time by you telling your neighbors, your friends,
[3:29:45.000 --> 3:29:48.000]  your family, your email list about this radio show.
[3:29:48.000 --> 3:29:50.000]  So keep spreading the word.
[3:29:50.000 --> 3:29:52.000]  The show is exploding in size.
[3:29:52.000 --> 3:29:53.000]  We're on the march.
[3:29:53.000 --> 3:29:55.000]  The Empire's on the run.
[3:29:55.000 --> 3:30:01.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:30:01.000 --> 3:30:06.000]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[3:30:06.000 --> 3:30:11.000]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick,
[3:30:11.000 --> 3:30:13.000]  go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[3:30:13.000 --> 3:30:15.000]  You don't have to cooperate.
[3:30:15.000 --> 3:30:16.000]  There is a solution.
[3:30:16.000 --> 3:30:19.000]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love,
[3:30:19.000 --> 3:30:24.000]  have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[3:31:25.000 --> 3:31:29.000]  PRISONPLANET.TV is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[3:31:29.000 --> 3:31:32.000]  PRISONPLANET.TV is a vault of forbidden information.

[3:31:45.000 --> 3:31:47.000]  by weekly news television broadcast,

[3:31:50.000 --> 3:31:53.000]  The info war is waiting for you to set it free.
[3:31:53.000 --> 3:31:56.000]  PRISONPLANET.TV, burn the info bombs to disk,
[3:31:56.000 --> 3:31:58.000]  put them on the file sharing networks,
[3:31:58.000 --> 3:32:00.000]  bring down the new world order.
[3:32:00.000 --> 3:32:02.000]  PRISONPLANET.TV.
[3:32:02.000 --> 3:32:04.000]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[3:32:04.000 --> 3:32:06.000]  What does humidity mean to you?
[3:32:06.000 --> 3:32:08.000]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days,
[3:32:08.000 --> 3:32:13.000]  but many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[3:32:13.000 --> 3:32:15.000]  That's why I'd like you to visit
[3:32:15.000 --> 3:32:17.000]  AkolaBlue.com.
[3:32:17.000 --> 3:32:20.000]  AkolaBlue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator

[3:33:11.000 --> 3:33:14.000]  The establishment gets you obsessed with left and right.
[3:33:14.000 --> 3:33:17.000]  Those are two wings on the same bird of prey.
[3:33:17.000 --> 3:33:21.000]  How about focusing on the bird's head, on its mind,
[3:33:21.000 --> 3:33:23.000]  on what controls those wings?
[3:33:23.000 --> 3:33:26.000]  We didn't have a left-right system until a hundred years ago, roughly,
[3:33:26.000 --> 3:33:28.000]  in this country and in the world.
[3:33:28.000 --> 3:33:33.000]  It was liberty versus tyranny, populism versus elitism.
[3:33:33.000 --> 3:33:37.000]  Who that person worked for?
[3:33:37.000 --> 3:33:41.000]  What that person stood for?
[3:33:41.000 --> 3:33:46.000]  And governments generally used wars to suppress their own domestic populations.
[3:33:46.000 --> 3:33:50.000]  There are even articles, letters written 500, 600, 700 years ago
[3:33:50.000 --> 3:33:53.000]  by different British royals to their French cousins,
[3:33:53.000 --> 3:33:55.000]  saying, yes, we're having rebellions here.
[3:33:55.000 --> 3:33:57.000]  We need to start a new war.
[3:33:57.000 --> 3:33:59.000]  Okay, how about next spring?
[3:33:59.000 --> 3:34:02.000]  Then it'll be nice weather for me to ride out and meet you.
[3:34:02.000 --> 3:34:05.000]  It was elites killing their own populations.
[3:34:05.000 --> 3:34:09.000]  They were one family in France, the Norman,
[3:34:09.000 --> 3:34:11.000]  that had already conquered England.
[3:34:11.000 --> 3:34:15.000]  And they were just out there killing their enemy, the people.
[3:34:15.000 --> 3:34:17.000]  In the staged war.
[3:34:17.000 --> 3:34:19.000]  They wrote books about it.
[3:34:19.000 --> 3:34:21.000]  But here's the modern fraudulent system.
[3:34:21.000 --> 3:34:25.000]  There's different ways to explain this, but the left-right paradigm.
[3:34:25.000 --> 3:34:30.000]  So this circle symbolizes the total political system
[3:34:30.000 --> 3:34:32.000]  within the control paradigm.
[3:34:32.000 --> 3:34:36.000]  And you have tyranny on one side of the spectrum,
[3:34:36.000 --> 3:34:39.000]  and you have freedom or liberty on the other.
[3:34:39.000 --> 3:34:42.000]  And then you have the left on one side
[3:34:42.000 --> 3:34:44.000]  and the right on the other.
[3:34:44.000 --> 3:34:47.000]  Now, the right can be pushed by the people
[3:34:47.000 --> 3:34:54.000]  because it's only a term to manifest towards freedom.
[3:34:54.000 --> 3:34:59.000]  Or it can be pushed to manifest towards tyranny.
[3:34:59.000 --> 3:35:04.000]  The left can be influenced by the people
[3:35:04.000 --> 3:35:08.000]  to push for freedom or for tyranny.
[3:35:08.000 --> 3:35:09.000]  And so they confuse you.
[3:35:09.000 --> 3:35:12.000]  And generally, when the left is out of power under George Bush
[3:35:12.000 --> 3:35:15.000]  for eight years, they can be against the Patriot Act
[3:35:15.000 --> 3:35:18.000]  and wars and secret arrest.
[3:35:18.000 --> 3:35:22.000]  But as soon as they're in power, they're suddenly for it all.
[3:35:22.000 --> 3:35:24.000]  Just like Republicans under Bill Clinton
[3:35:24.000 --> 3:35:26.000]  could be against the police state
[3:35:26.000 --> 3:35:28.000]  and Patriot Act type legislation.
[3:35:28.000 --> 3:35:30.000]  John Ashcroft was against it.
[3:35:30.000 --> 3:35:38.000]  But as soon as he's in power, now they go for the tyranny.
[3:35:38.000 --> 3:35:40.000]  And so while they're confusing us,
[3:35:40.000 --> 3:35:44.000]  getting us to fight with each other over left and right,
[3:35:44.000 --> 3:35:49.000]  we're not involved within this system with the real debate
[3:35:49.000 --> 3:35:54.000]  of is it freedom or is it tyranny.
[3:35:54.000 --> 3:35:57.000]  Because this whole left-right system,
[3:35:57.000 --> 3:36:00.000]  as they move back and forth towards tyranny
[3:36:00.000 --> 3:36:02.000]  or towards freedom and liberty,
[3:36:02.000 --> 3:36:06.000]  is just something to confuse the people.
[3:36:06.000 --> 3:36:08.000]  So let's see where Glenn Beck is.
[3:36:08.000 --> 3:36:12.000]  Glenn Beck was for the Banker bailout.
[3:36:12.000 --> 3:36:14.000]  Glenn Beck was for the Patriot Act.
[3:36:14.000 --> 3:36:19.000]  Glenn Beck was for the war.
[3:36:19.000 --> 3:36:21.000]  He's for tyranny.
[3:36:21.000 --> 3:36:23.000]  Okay, so he's supposedly on the right
[3:36:23.000 --> 3:36:26.000]  and he's for all these things.
[3:36:26.000 --> 3:36:28.000]  Now what is Obama for?
[3:36:28.000 --> 3:36:30.000]  For the war, for the Patriot Act,
[3:36:30.000 --> 3:36:32.000]  for warrantless wiretapping, for the Banker bailout.
[3:36:32.000 --> 3:36:36.000]  When you actually look at real issues,
[3:36:36.000 --> 3:36:45.000]  these guys are 100% the same.
[3:36:45.000 --> 3:36:50.000]  But they'll throw a Van Jones to the Lions
[3:36:50.000 --> 3:36:53.000]  in the left-right gladiatorial arena.
[3:36:53.000 --> 3:36:55.000]  That's all this is.
[3:36:55.000 --> 3:36:59.000]  They'll have Van Jones, the little gladiator,
[3:36:59.000 --> 3:37:02.000]  get hacked up by Glenn Beck,
[3:37:02.000 --> 3:37:05.000]  the bigger gladiator who's got the big sword.
[3:37:05.000 --> 3:37:07.000]  He'll hack Van Jones up
[3:37:07.000 --> 3:37:12.000]  and give you a whole left-right show.
[3:37:12.000 --> 3:37:13.000]  You guys are laughing.
[3:37:13.000 --> 3:37:15.000]  Is this a good analogy?
[3:37:15.000 --> 3:37:17.000]  Because if you look, that's all this is is an arena.
[3:37:17.000 --> 3:37:22.000]  I'm asking people to get outside the box
[3:37:22.000 --> 3:37:26.000]  and to have a larger debate about tyranny and freedom.
[3:37:26.000 --> 3:37:27.000]  Tyranny and liberty.
[3:37:27.000 --> 3:37:29.000]  Which side you're on?
[3:37:29.000 --> 3:37:32.000]  Oppression and freedom.
[3:37:32.000 --> 3:37:37.000]  Okay, there's my analogy.
[3:37:37.000 --> 3:37:48.000]  Brought to you by infowars.com, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:37:48.000 --> 3:37:50.000]  And we'll give them a cigarette this month.
[3:37:50.000 --> 3:37:51.000]  There we go.
[3:37:51.000 --> 3:37:52.000]  Or something else.
[3:37:52.000 --> 3:37:55.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:37:55.000 --> 3:37:56.000]  There's the boil down.
[3:37:56.000 --> 3:38:01.000]  But I do challenge everybody to go get this article
[3:38:01.000 --> 3:38:05.000]  titled Obama Regulatory Reform Plan Officially Establishes
[3:38:05.000 --> 3:38:07.000]  Making Dictatorship in the United States.
[3:38:07.000 --> 3:38:10.000]  I want to challenge all of you to get this out to everybody.
[3:38:10.000 --> 3:38:12.000]  Because while we're diverted and distracted by health care,
[3:38:12.000 --> 3:38:15.000]  they've decided for now to pull that off the front burner.
[3:38:15.000 --> 3:38:18.000]  They may try to sneak it through on the budget.
[3:38:18.000 --> 3:38:21.000]  But that's pretty much a dead issue right now.
[3:38:21.000 --> 3:38:24.000]  They're going to go now for the banking takeover.
[3:38:24.000 --> 3:38:25.000]  That's the big enchilada.
[3:38:25.000 --> 3:38:27.000]  They tried four or five months ago.
[3:38:27.000 --> 3:38:28.000]  It failed.
[3:38:28.000 --> 3:38:30.000]  They're coming back again.
[3:38:30.000 --> 3:38:33.000]  Just like they do with amnesty.
[3:38:33.000 --> 3:38:35.000]  So that's the bottom line.
[3:38:35.000 --> 3:38:37.000]  We'll cover it more.
[3:38:37.000 --> 3:38:43.000]  But Glenn Beck and others are going to be focusing in on firing
[3:38:43.000 --> 3:38:45.000]  different czars or things.
[3:38:45.000 --> 3:38:50.000]  They all want you to focus on the puppet Obama.
[3:38:50.000 --> 3:38:53.000]  By the way, conversely, they don't just have Glenn Beck
[3:38:53.000 --> 3:38:59.000]  crushing the smaller gladiator of Van Jones.
[3:38:59.000 --> 3:39:00.000]  This is Beck.
[3:39:00.000 --> 3:39:01.000]  This is Jones.
[3:39:01.000 --> 3:39:07.000]  Obama then later, he gets to be a bigger gladiator in a puppet,
[3:39:07.000 --> 3:39:09.000]  and he gets to crush Beck.
[3:39:09.000 --> 3:39:15.000]  And then later, a phony Republican leader,
[3:39:15.000 --> 3:39:21.000]  he gets to come along and crush Beck.
[3:39:21.000 --> 3:39:24.000]  He gets to come along and crush Obama, who crushed Beck.
[3:39:24.000 --> 3:39:27.000]  And then there'll be another Democratic leader that crushes him.
[3:39:27.000 --> 3:39:28.000]  This is all a diversion.
[3:39:28.000 --> 3:39:32.000]  While you're in the bleachers, watching your liberty be destroyed
[3:39:32.000 --> 3:39:35.000]  inside the gladiatorial system.
[3:39:35.000 --> 3:39:39.000]  That is an incredibly good picture right there.
[3:39:39.000 --> 3:39:40.000]  That's enough.
[3:39:40.000 --> 3:39:42.000]  Let's bring Rob due in.
[3:39:42.000 --> 3:39:45.000]  Rob is coming in.
[3:39:45.000 --> 3:39:47.000]  He'll take a moment to get situated.
[3:39:47.000 --> 3:39:49.000]  Yes, we're going to do a bunch of flu shows.
[3:39:49.000 --> 3:39:51.000]  We've done a bunch of flu shows.
[3:39:51.000 --> 3:39:55.000]  We're going to cover a bunch of flu news coming up this week
[3:39:55.000 --> 3:39:58.000]  and next week with a bunch of other medical doctors and 10 penny
[3:39:58.000 --> 3:40:03.000]  and quail, who's not a doctor, but Horowitz and others are going
[3:40:03.000 --> 3:40:06.000]  to be coming on to go over all of this.
[3:40:06.000 --> 3:40:08.000]  But yes, there's mercury in it.
[3:40:08.000 --> 3:40:11.000]  Yes, it's causing all sorts of illnesses in the trials.
[3:40:11.000 --> 3:40:15.000]  Yes, they're planning on forced inoculations.
[3:40:15.000 --> 3:40:17.000]  Tell folks, Rob, do what this particular document is here.
[3:40:17.000 --> 3:40:18.000]  You have.
[3:40:18.000 --> 3:40:19.000]  All right.
[3:40:19.000 --> 3:40:21.000]  I got a document sent to us.
[3:40:21.000 --> 3:40:25.000]  It's entitled H1N1Panavax swine flu vaccine, and this was
[3:40:25.000 --> 3:40:28.000]  given out to healthcare workers in Australia, mainly.
[3:40:28.000 --> 3:40:31.000]  And it's to train them on how to administer the vaccine,
[3:40:31.000 --> 3:40:32.000]  the schedule.
[3:40:32.000 --> 3:40:33.000]  It's the same one.
[3:40:33.000 --> 3:40:34.000]  H1N1Panavax.
[3:40:34.000 --> 3:40:35.000]  Show folks.
[3:40:35.000 --> 3:40:39.000]  There's the PDF that government of western Australia.
[3:40:39.000 --> 3:40:40.000]  And we've got the same.
[3:40:40.000 --> 3:40:43.000]  This is all a carbon copy just with local rules of the level
[3:40:43.000 --> 3:40:45.000]  six UN document we've covered on air.
[3:40:45.000 --> 3:40:46.000]  Right.
[3:40:46.000 --> 3:40:47.000]  Exactly.
[3:40:47.000 --> 3:40:49.000]  Oh, and look what the witches are making.
[3:40:49.000 --> 3:40:51.000]  Slide 16 is a pretty interesting one.
[3:40:51.000 --> 3:40:54.000]  It's got the witches brew and it says what's in it and it lists
[3:40:54.000 --> 3:40:56.000]  the stuff that's in there.
[3:40:56.000 --> 3:40:59.000]  And on slide 18, it admits that there's the Marisol and that it
[3:40:59.000 --> 3:41:03.000]  can be toxic after it reaches certain levels in the body.
[3:41:03.000 --> 3:41:06.000]  And it said, but there's no evidence that it will cause
[3:41:06.000 --> 3:41:09.000]  neurological developments or abnormalities.
[3:41:09.000 --> 3:41:11.000]  Yeah, they just admit that mercury does it.
[3:41:11.000 --> 3:41:14.000]  It's toxic, but it won't cause these specific things.
[3:41:14.000 --> 3:41:17.000]  It's not going to do cause ADHD or autism.
[3:41:17.000 --> 3:41:20.000]  And then they made changes.
[3:41:20.000 --> 3:41:22.000]  Basically, they want to give the younger kids two doses of the
[3:41:22.000 --> 3:41:23.000]  vaccine.
[3:41:23.000 --> 3:41:26.000]  If you're 10 or older, they only want to give you one dose.
[3:41:26.000 --> 3:41:28.000]  So here it's three.
[3:41:28.000 --> 3:41:29.000]  Yeah.
[3:41:29.000 --> 3:41:31.000]  Dr. Obama says, and again, we're not saying there's going to be
[3:41:31.000 --> 3:41:33.000]  quarantines and forced inoculations.
[3:41:33.000 --> 3:41:35.000]  The government is saying they're preparing for it.
[3:41:35.000 --> 3:41:37.000]  We're trying to politically get the word out.
[3:41:37.000 --> 3:41:41.000]  So the enforcers, the nurses, the doctors, the police say no.
[3:41:41.000 --> 3:41:44.000]  So the whole program falls through and that's now starting to
[3:41:44.000 --> 3:41:46.000]  happen, but we're not out of the woods yet.
[3:41:46.000 --> 3:41:49.000]  We're in the fight, but we're not out of the woods yet here.
[3:41:49.000 --> 3:41:50.000]  Yeah.
[3:41:50.000 --> 3:41:52.000]  So we're going to put this document up online.
[3:41:52.000 --> 3:41:55.000]  Kurt's going to, I sent it to him with a little article on the
[3:41:55.000 --> 3:41:58.000]  slides that I thought were more interesting for people to look
[3:41:58.000 --> 3:41:59.000]  at themselves.
[3:41:59.000 --> 3:42:00.000]  So take a look at it.
[3:42:00.000 --> 3:42:03.000]  It's about 80 pages long, but it's a, it's a quick read.
[3:42:03.000 --> 3:42:07.000]  It's a slide show basically from a company called CSL.
[3:42:07.000 --> 3:42:10.000]  They're one of the biggest manufacturers of the vaccine in
[3:42:10.000 --> 3:42:11.000]  the Southern hemisphere.
[3:42:11.000 --> 3:42:15.000]  So they stand to make a lot of money, of course.
[3:42:15.000 --> 3:42:19.000]  Off of, we're now going into full swing flu season.
[3:42:19.000 --> 3:42:22.000]  It's killed not even a thousand people yet in the U S regular
[3:42:22.000 --> 3:42:23.000]  flu kills 30 something.
[3:42:23.000 --> 3:42:26.000]  Now, why are we taking a vaccine for this?
[3:42:26.000 --> 3:42:29.000]  Well, we know they've been caught before adding cancer,
[3:42:29.000 --> 3:42:31.000]  viruses and Sterilins to them.
[3:42:31.000 --> 3:42:35.000]  And the White House science are in his own book, eco science
[3:42:35.000 --> 3:42:36.000]  calls for it.
[3:42:36.000 --> 3:42:38.000]  What does that sound like to you?
[3:42:38.000 --> 3:42:39.000]  Sounds like eugenics.
[3:42:39.000 --> 3:42:40.000]  Let's roll our sleet.
[3:42:40.000 --> 3:42:42.000]  No, let's drink the fluoride.
[3:42:42.000 --> 3:42:44.000]  I mean, you know, it only causes bone cancer and brain damage.
[3:42:44.000 --> 3:42:45.000]  I mean, let's trust them.
[3:42:45.000 --> 3:42:46.000]  Come on.
[3:42:46.000 --> 3:42:47.000]  Yeah.
[3:42:47.000 --> 3:42:49.000]  And they haven't, they've enlisted pregnant women,
[3:42:49.000 --> 3:42:51.000]  indigenous people, healthcare workers.
[3:42:51.000 --> 3:42:54.000]  Oh, they needed it especially those indigenous people.
[3:42:54.000 --> 3:42:56.000]  I thought that was interesting that they just put indigenous
[3:42:56.000 --> 3:42:57.000]  people on there.
[3:42:57.000 --> 3:43:00.000]  And by the way, the autoimmune disorders that vaccines cause
[3:43:00.000 --> 3:43:02.000]  when a woman is pregnant, you're never supposed to take
[3:43:02.000 --> 3:43:03.000]  vaccines when you're pregnant.
[3:43:03.000 --> 3:43:04.000]  Right.
[3:43:04.000 --> 3:43:05.000]  And what do you think of my artwork?
[3:43:05.000 --> 3:43:06.000]  Yeah, it's awesome.
[3:43:06.000 --> 3:43:08.000]  Do you go to the art institute?
[3:43:08.000 --> 3:43:09.000]  It is.
[3:43:09.000 --> 3:43:13.000]  It's a, it's a, it really illustrates the paradigm.
[3:43:13.000 --> 3:43:16.000]  The paradigm of the squared circle.
[3:43:16.000 --> 3:43:19.000]  Maybe somebody, like one of the great directors out there,
[3:43:19.000 --> 3:43:22.000]  like Nuff, respect will take it and turn it into an animation.
[3:43:22.000 --> 3:43:23.000]  Right.
[3:43:23.000 --> 3:43:26.000]  Like he did with my left right paradigm one before where I
[3:43:26.000 --> 3:43:31.000]  described it as a pillar instead of as a gladiatorial arena.
[3:43:31.000 --> 3:43:32.000]  That'd be interesting.
[3:43:32.000 --> 3:43:35.000]  And then just take shots of gladiator people getting hacked to
[3:43:35.000 --> 3:43:36.000]  death.
[3:43:36.000 --> 3:43:38.000]  But anyway, that's, that's going to be up.
[3:43:38.000 --> 3:43:39.000]  Kurt's going to post that.
[3:43:39.000 --> 3:43:40.000]  Hey, look at this.
[3:43:40.000 --> 3:43:42.000]  Even the mail online, big newspaper.
[3:43:42.000 --> 3:43:43.000]  Yeah.
[3:43:43.000 --> 3:43:47.000]  Says has Osama bin Laden been dead for seven years in our U.S.
[3:43:47.000 --> 3:43:49.000]  and Britain covering it up to continue the war on terror?
[3:43:49.000 --> 3:43:52.000]  I mean, even mainstream news is talking like us now.
[3:43:52.000 --> 3:43:57.000]  And the Intel center known CIA run is up, is, is, is uploading
[3:43:57.000 --> 3:43:58.000]  new ones.
[3:43:58.000 --> 3:43:59.000]  I mean, there's just no end to it.
[3:43:59.000 --> 3:44:01.000]  Well, they're going to keep using them until, I mean, I think
[3:44:01.000 --> 3:44:05.000]  even if we had physical proof that he was dead, they'd say,
[3:44:05.000 --> 3:44:06.000]  oh, that's just a fake imposter.
[3:44:06.000 --> 3:44:08.000]  The real bin Laden's making tapes and sending them in.
[3:44:08.000 --> 3:44:09.000]  I don't think the world,
[3:44:09.000 --> 3:44:12.000]  we'll are great grandchildren on the Mars base.
[3:44:12.000 --> 3:44:13.000]  Be scared of Osama bin Laden.
[3:44:13.000 --> 3:44:14.000]  It'll be like the boogeyman.
[3:44:14.000 --> 3:44:15.000]  Look out.
[3:44:15.000 --> 3:44:17.000]  A bin Laden's under your bed and people will believe it.
[3:44:17.000 --> 3:44:18.000]  He was seen.
[3:44:18.000 --> 3:44:20.000]  A man with a turban was seen on the Mars base.
[3:44:20.000 --> 3:44:22.000]  We've got to take the shots.
[3:44:22.000 --> 3:44:26.000]  You know, we're not going to, but we're not going to Mars.
[3:44:26.000 --> 3:44:28.000]  We're just going to die right here with that with a eugenicist
[3:44:28.000 --> 3:44:31.000]  running around an orgy of death and killing.
[3:44:31.000 --> 3:44:34.000]  Yeah, it's a shame because Mars probably, well, I hear it has
[3:44:34.000 --> 3:44:36.000]  a blue sunset anyway.
[3:44:36.000 --> 3:44:38.000]  It's your ass to Mars.
[3:44:38.000 --> 3:44:39.000]  All right.
[3:44:39.000 --> 3:44:40.000]  That's all I had.
[3:44:40.000 --> 3:44:41.000]  All right.
[3:44:41.000 --> 3:44:43.000]  Thank you so much for popping in with us there.
[3:44:43.000 --> 3:44:45.000]  By the way, John, just one more.
[3:44:45.000 --> 3:44:46.000]  We run yet, Ted.
[3:44:46.000 --> 3:44:49.000]  I want a two minute report at the end of the show from him on
[3:44:49.000 --> 3:44:50.000]  the latest on the economy.
[3:44:50.000 --> 3:44:52.000]  I want to go to calls right now.
[3:44:52.000 --> 3:44:54.000]  Chris and Marilyn, Chris, you're on the air.
[3:44:54.000 --> 3:44:55.000]  Go ahead.
[3:44:55.000 --> 3:44:57.000]  Hey, how are you doing?
[3:44:57.000 --> 3:44:59.000]  I'm doing all right, brother.
[3:44:59.000 --> 3:45:00.000]  Okay.
[3:45:00.000 --> 3:45:03.000]  Hey, um, I don't know if it was from you or from me because I
[3:45:03.000 --> 3:45:06.000]  sent you an article from Forbes.com that said that the dollar
[3:45:06.000 --> 3:45:10.000]  actually collapsed, um, stating that gold, it was selling at
[3:45:10.000 --> 3:45:12.000]  a thousand dollars an ounce.
[3:45:12.000 --> 3:45:18.000]  But I also sent you an article, um, about, uh, some, how an
[3:45:18.000 --> 3:45:23.000]  executive for CNN as far back as 1999 admitted to having military
[3:45:23.000 --> 3:45:25.000]  psyopsis interns at CNN.
[3:45:25.000 --> 3:45:26.000]  And I sent it to you.
[3:45:26.000 --> 3:45:28.000]  You know, that was the Washington Post.
[3:45:28.000 --> 3:45:30.000]  It's all Pentagon run.
[3:45:30.000 --> 3:45:32.000]  Uh, Fox is meant to be cartoonish and silly.
[3:45:32.000 --> 3:45:37.000]  CNN's the global arm of U S media and it's completely Gorba doll
[3:45:37.000 --> 3:45:40.000]  admitted he was there for nine 11 and there were full bird
[3:45:40.000 --> 3:45:43.000]  kernels and generals telling the producers what to do.
[3:45:43.000 --> 3:45:47.000]  And, uh, no, I mean, I have the army follows me.
[3:45:47.000 --> 3:45:49.000]  They follow Ron Paul.
[3:45:49.000 --> 3:45:50.000]  Yeah, there's Forbes.
[3:45:50.000 --> 3:45:56.000]  It's, uh, the dollars coming collapse is the headline.
[3:45:56.000 --> 3:46:00.000]  Inflation fears have many predicting a large dollar drop.
[3:46:00.000 --> 3:46:05.000]  One, uh, federal lines portfolio manager is prepared.
[3:46:05.000 --> 3:46:10.000]  And so yes, Chris, very, very serious times were in Alex.
[3:46:10.000 --> 3:46:11.000]  Yes.
[3:46:11.000 --> 3:46:14.000]  Um, one last thing, I'll talk to my dad about this because I
[3:46:14.000 --> 3:46:17.000]  turned him on to your show and now he loves your show like
[3:46:17.000 --> 3:46:19.000]  better than anything else.
[3:46:19.000 --> 3:46:23.000]  Um, I was downtown in Washington, DC over the weekend during
[3:46:23.000 --> 3:46:27.000]  that protest and I was shouting out to people to check your
[3:46:27.000 --> 3:46:30.000]  website out, um, info wars.com.
[3:46:30.000 --> 3:46:34.000]  Check out the Obama deception film you put out the end game,
[3:46:34.000 --> 3:46:37.000]  the global enslavement, all of your film.
[3:46:37.000 --> 3:46:40.000]  So if you get hit on your website more than ever,
[3:46:40.000 --> 3:46:42.000]  hopefully it's from some of these protesters.
[3:46:42.000 --> 3:46:46.000]  No, I know that I heard there were tyranny response team
[3:46:46.000 --> 3:46:48.000]  shirts there with info wars.
[3:46:48.000 --> 3:46:50.000]  I heard there were a lot of our Obama new world order signs
[3:46:50.000 --> 3:46:51.000]  there.
[3:46:51.000 --> 3:46:52.000]  Did you see any of those?
[3:46:52.000 --> 3:46:56.000]  Yes, I saw a lot of them and people they were there on the
[3:46:56.000 --> 3:47:00.000]  scale from, you know, one guy to sign a said with a man's butt
[3:47:00.000 --> 3:47:06.000]  and butt out of my health care to impeach Obama and basically
[3:47:06.000 --> 3:47:08.000]  the country's waking up.
[3:47:08.000 --> 3:47:10.000]  There had to have been between a million and a half to two
[3:47:10.000 --> 3:47:11.000]  million people there.
[3:47:11.000 --> 3:47:12.000]  Yeah.
[3:47:12.000 --> 3:47:13.000]  Well, no, the park services, two million.
[3:47:13.000 --> 3:47:15.000]  So the New York Times says 2000.
[3:47:15.000 --> 3:47:16.000]  Thank you, Chris.
[3:47:16.000 --> 3:47:18.000]  Josh in California.
[3:47:18.000 --> 3:47:19.000]  Josh, you're on the air.
[3:47:19.000 --> 3:47:20.000]  Go ahead.
[3:47:20.000 --> 3:47:21.000]  Hi, Alex.
[3:47:21.000 --> 3:47:22.000]  How are you doing?
[3:47:22.000 --> 3:47:23.000]  Good, bro.
[3:47:23.000 --> 3:47:29.000]  I have a couple criticisms for you if you're open to them.
[3:47:29.000 --> 3:47:31.000]  Yeah, I'm ready for your criticisms.
[3:47:31.000 --> 3:47:33.000]  But what are we going to do about the new world order?
[3:47:33.000 --> 3:47:35.000]  I'm not the one taxing you.
[3:47:35.000 --> 3:47:37.000]  I'm not the one putting fluoride in your water.
[3:47:37.000 --> 3:47:39.000]  I'm not the one bringing in world government.
[3:47:39.000 --> 3:47:42.000]  I know everybody spends about half their time about me.
[3:47:42.000 --> 3:47:44.000]  And overall, that's actually good for us.
[3:47:44.000 --> 3:47:45.000]  It gets us more listeners.
[3:47:45.000 --> 3:47:47.000]  But I don't care about me.
[3:47:47.000 --> 3:47:48.000]  I'm sick of it being about me.
[3:47:48.000 --> 3:47:49.000]  But go ahead.
[3:47:49.000 --> 3:47:57.000]  Well, you always talk a lot about the gold solution and getting back to a gold standard.
[3:47:57.000 --> 3:48:01.000]  And I just wanted to debate that honest.
[3:48:01.000 --> 3:48:03.000]  No, I really don't do that.
[3:48:03.000 --> 3:48:08.000]  I said we need to get off the private fellow reserve system and we should debate a gold
[3:48:08.000 --> 3:48:11.000]  back or a partially gold back or a fiat system.
[3:48:11.000 --> 3:48:15.000]  And I've had people on both sides of that.
[3:48:15.000 --> 3:48:17.000]  Ron Paul included.
[3:48:17.000 --> 3:48:21.000]  So misrepresentation, straw man again.
[3:48:21.000 --> 3:48:26.000]  What I would suggest is something a little different, which hasn't really been tried out.
[3:48:26.000 --> 3:48:33.000]  But it has to do with the idea that we have a common credit system that's not controlled
[3:48:33.000 --> 3:48:37.000]  by the central banking system like the credit system currently is.
[3:48:37.000 --> 3:48:44.000]  But that kind of like an eBay feedback system for people individually where you have credit
[3:48:44.000 --> 3:48:50.000]  based on your own issuance of your own promissory notes, which is what we're doing right now.
[3:48:50.000 --> 3:48:57.000]  But we need the ability to expand the credit and contract it to be able to create the goods
[3:48:57.000 --> 3:49:04.000]  in the economy and the services, which is one of the benefits of having the system that
[3:49:04.000 --> 3:49:06.000]  we have right now with commercial credit.
[3:49:06.000 --> 3:49:07.000]  I hear you.
[3:49:07.000 --> 3:49:10.000]  Why don't you write up the idea and send it to writersandinfowars.com.
[3:49:10.000 --> 3:49:14.000]  I'm just tired of straw man attacks.
[3:49:14.000 --> 3:49:18.000]  99% of the time when I see something on the Internet about me, it's something I've not
[3:49:18.000 --> 3:49:21.000]  said or not done or it's distorted.
[3:49:21.000 --> 3:49:32.000]  I had the writer and editor and voiceover person for the money master's on over and over again
[3:49:32.000 --> 3:49:36.000]  that has a fiat money solution fix.
[3:49:36.000 --> 3:49:41.000]  I've had cook that let's get cook back on the economist, the rights for global research
[3:49:41.000 --> 3:49:44.000]  who wants a fiat system.
[3:49:44.000 --> 3:49:51.000]  I've had Walter Burian and others on about the fiat system solution.
[3:49:51.000 --> 3:49:54.000]  And then I've had Ron Paul on who has his system.
[3:49:54.000 --> 3:50:04.000]  Man, I'm so, you know, I resented for you that it's a religion, an entire cottage industry
[3:50:04.000 --> 3:50:09.000]  of distorting what I say and what I stand for.
[3:50:09.000 --> 3:50:14.000]  And it's just very, I mean, it's hard to take you seriously with your monetary plan when
[3:50:14.000 --> 3:50:18.000]  you say you disagree with me on something I haven't even said.
[3:50:18.000 --> 3:50:22.000]  Yes, the gold standard, we can't go back to it because the central banks know it's real
[3:50:22.000 --> 3:50:25.000]  money and they've hoarded the hell out of it.
[3:50:25.000 --> 3:50:29.000]  And so then you would be right back to square one with them fractionally reserved, loaning
[3:50:29.000 --> 3:50:31.000]  stuff out on that.
[3:50:31.000 --> 3:50:33.000]  I understand that.
[3:50:33.000 --> 3:50:36.000]  But if we'd have stayed on that system, it'd have been a hell of a lot better than what
[3:50:36.000 --> 3:50:37.000]  we got now.
[3:50:37.000 --> 3:50:43.000]  So let's just not have the bankers take over right now completely over the whole economy.
[3:50:43.000 --> 3:50:48.000]  And then after we have indicted them and arrested them and brought them to justice, then we
[3:50:48.000 --> 3:50:51.000]  can have a national debate about what we want.
[3:50:51.000 --> 3:50:53.000]  But it isn't about Alex Jones.
[3:50:53.000 --> 3:50:59.000]  I mean, the ship's sinking here and I'm getting bitched at trying to lower lifeboats over.
[3:50:59.000 --> 3:51:00.000]  Hello, friends.
[3:51:00.000 --> 3:51:05.000]  This is Alex Jones here to tell you about Calben Soap.
[3:51:05.000 --> 3:51:10.000]  My staff and I just love the old fashioned pure handmade soap produced by the Calben
[3:51:10.000 --> 3:51:15.000]  Soap Company, a family owned and operated American company that's over 62 years old.
[3:51:15.000 --> 3:51:19.000]  Go to fivestarsoaps.com or click on their link at infowars.com.
[3:51:19.000 --> 3:51:21.000]  They have been a long time sponsor of ours.
[3:51:21.000 --> 3:51:25.000]  Calben Soaps meet the highest standards of quality, purity and value.
[3:51:25.000 --> 3:51:27.000]  Everyone should use their great line of products.
[3:51:27.000 --> 3:51:32.000]  I consistently hear from my listeners and friends how much they love the Calben Pure

[3:51:42.000 --> 3:51:43.000]  anywhere.
[3:51:43.000 --> 3:51:45.000]  Don't take my word for it.

[3:51:57.000 --> 3:51:58.000]  You're going to love them.
[3:51:58.000 --> 3:52:25.000]  You will never use anything else again.
[3:52:25.000 --> 3:52:30.000]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[3:52:30.000 --> 3:52:38.000]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[3:52:38.000 --> 3:52:40.000]  It's not about left or right.
[3:52:40.000 --> 3:52:42.000]  It's about a one world government.
[3:52:42.000 --> 3:52:49.000]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told and his real agenda.
[3:52:49.000 --> 3:52:55.000]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in super high quality
[3:52:55.000 --> 3:52:57.000]  at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:52:57.000 --> 3:53:01.000]  The Obama deception, the people strike back.
[3:53:01.000 --> 3:53:06.000]  There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[3:53:06.000 --> 3:53:09.000]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[3:53:09.000 --> 3:53:13.000]  He was devastated, but it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a
[3:53:13.000 --> 3:53:17.000]  great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day,
[3:53:17.000 --> 3:53:18.000]  there is no job security.
[3:53:18.000 --> 3:53:23.000]  You are always in danger of losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood
[3:53:23.000 --> 3:53:24.000]  and own your own business.
[3:53:24.000 --> 3:53:27.000]  Since you are the boss, nobody can fire you.
[3:53:27.000 --> 3:53:33.000]  So MZ has been his own boss for over 37 years and he is passionate about turning other people
[3:53:33.000 --> 3:53:37.000]  on to the joys and benefits of working for themselves and not for others.
[3:53:37.000 --> 3:53:42.000]  MZ wants to tell you about a low cost home business opportunity involving the marketing
[3:53:42.000 --> 3:53:46.000]  of helpful dark chocolate that can help people lose weight and set you up with an impressive
[3:53:46.000 --> 3:53:48.000]  compounding monthly income.
[3:53:48.000 --> 3:53:52.000]  Visit chocolate.ownmyself.com and check out the opportunity.
[3:53:52.000 --> 3:53:55.000]  That's chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[3:53:55.000 --> 3:53:59.000]  It takes very little money and if you're interested, MZ wants to talk to you.
[3:53:59.000 --> 3:54:17.000]  That's chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[3:54:17.000 --> 3:54:33.000]  I wanted to get some financial news from Ted Anderson but crank that song back up.
[3:54:33.000 --> 3:54:52.000]  I wanted to get Ted on briefly because Forbes, AP Reuters, every day I see a whole bunch
[3:54:52.000 --> 3:54:56.000]  of articles saying that the dollar is dead.
[3:54:56.000 --> 3:55:01.000]  Now, they may just be hyping that to drive things down again to fear monger people into
[3:55:01.000 --> 3:55:05.000]  the bank of the world taking over, then they'll jack it back up again.
[3:55:05.000 --> 3:55:10.000]  But the dollar's days are numbered in this incarnation.
[3:55:10.000 --> 3:55:14.000]  They're bringing in a world currency that's probably going to be somewhat dollar backed
[3:55:14.000 --> 3:55:16.000]  but a basket.
[3:55:16.000 --> 3:55:21.000]  Regardless, when you get $23.7 trillion, over $50 trillion globally stolen from nations
[3:55:21.000 --> 3:55:26.000]  by the private banking families, now coming back in the market to buy stocks, to buy real
[3:55:26.000 --> 3:55:31.000]  estate, to buy infrastructure, to buy media, and to buy commodities, you're going to see
[3:55:31.000 --> 3:55:33.000]  inflation and all the commodities are going up.
[3:55:33.000 --> 3:55:35.000]  Look at gold right at $1,000.
[3:55:35.000 --> 3:55:40.000]  Ted Anderson, I heard there were some defaults too by gold companies.
[3:55:40.000 --> 3:55:42.000]  Yeah, American Barrick had to pull out of there.
[3:55:42.000 --> 3:55:46.000]  They've been hedging their position that they have in the ground.
[3:55:46.000 --> 3:55:51.000]  They've been selling short to sell forward their position that they haven't even pulled
[3:55:51.000 --> 3:55:52.000]  out of the ground yet.
[3:55:52.000 --> 3:55:58.000]  They don't have enough gold in production to support those short contracts.
[3:55:58.000 --> 3:56:02.000]  So last Friday, American Barrick defaulted on some and they're doing what the kid has
[3:56:02.000 --> 3:56:03.000]  to settle up with others.
[3:56:03.000 --> 3:56:07.000]  It's not a very bright scene, but that's the hedging.
[3:56:07.000 --> 3:56:13.000]  So all the squirrelingness to manipulate and keep gold prices down isn't working.
[3:56:13.000 --> 3:56:19.000]  Briefly, Ted, tell folks about the coin offers you've got left at that 944 level with gold
[3:56:19.000 --> 3:56:22.000]  sales and gigantic discount, but this is the end.
[3:56:22.000 --> 3:56:24.000]  You've sold off of most of it.
[3:56:24.000 --> 3:56:26.000]  Yeah, this is the end, my friend.
[3:56:26.000 --> 3:56:32.000]  The 10 dollar Liberty right now at 1850 is the same price as it was when gold was down
[3:56:32.000 --> 3:56:34.000]  there at that 945 level.
[3:56:34.000 --> 3:56:36.000]  The Franks are currently right now at 233.
[3:56:36.000 --> 3:56:39.000]  They're going to be edging up British sovereigns too.
[3:56:39.000 --> 3:56:46.000]  Really, in silver, again, is the best buy that I have without hands down 869 for walking
[3:56:46.000 --> 3:56:52.000]  liberties when the spot prices silver currently right now is at $16.58.
[3:56:52.000 --> 3:56:57.000]  If you figure out that walking Liberty, you know, multiply it by two and it gives you
[3:56:57.000 --> 3:56:59.000]  an idea, you know, compare it to the silver dollar price.
[3:56:59.000 --> 3:57:02.000]  It's like about a six, seven dollar discount off of that.
[3:57:02.000 --> 3:57:04.000]  So yeah, it's really a good buy.
[3:57:04.000 --> 3:57:07.000]  Sorry, Ted, forgot to hit my cough button there.
[3:57:07.000 --> 3:57:08.000]  No, that's okay.
[3:57:08.000 --> 3:57:14.000]  I mean, I just Alex right now, though the market is just so hot and and it's it's
[3:57:14.000 --> 3:57:19.000]  reminding me of a year and a half ago when I even bags of junk silver became
[3:57:19.000 --> 3:57:20.000]  unavailable.
[3:57:20.000 --> 3:57:21.000]  Crew grounds.
[3:57:21.000 --> 3:57:22.000]  You couldn't get a maple.
[3:57:22.000 --> 3:57:23.000]  Absolutely.
[3:57:23.000 --> 3:57:26.000]  You've got gold and silver at the lowest price people are going to find anywhere.
[3:57:26.000 --> 3:57:27.000]  It's almost running out.
[3:57:27.000 --> 3:57:29.000]  You're having trouble getting more supplies.
[3:57:29.000 --> 3:57:32.000]  Even at the higher number, folks need to move on this now.
[3:57:32.000 --> 3:57:37.000]  The brokers will be there at Genesis at Midas Resources until midnight tonight.
[3:57:37.000 --> 3:57:45.000]  It's central 1-800-686-2237-800-686-2237.
[3:57:45.000 --> 3:57:47.000]  Tell them it's the Alex Jones, Ted Anderson special.
[3:57:47.000 --> 3:57:52.000]  You'll be paying a thousand dollars or more an ounce and a lot more for the silver.
[3:57:52.000 --> 3:57:53.000]  800-686-2237.
[3:57:53.000 --> 3:57:56.000]  So you've got the Franks and the sovereigns.
[3:57:56.000 --> 3:57:58.000]  What else do you have in silver, Ted?
[3:57:58.000 --> 3:58:00.000]  Franks, sovereigns, walking Liberty halves in the silver.
[3:58:00.000 --> 3:58:02.000]  I would suggest those hands down.
[3:58:02.000 --> 3:58:06.000]  Although that Lakota corn is going to be pushing up again there at 2230.
[3:58:06.000 --> 3:58:08.000]  There's a good variety of things.
[3:58:08.000 --> 3:58:10.000]  What's your half dollar at?
[3:58:10.000 --> 3:58:12.000]  Half dollars at 869.
[3:58:12.000 --> 3:58:13.000]  That's below spot.
[3:58:13.000 --> 3:58:14.000]  That's below spot.
[3:58:14.000 --> 3:58:15.000]  I know.
[3:58:15.000 --> 3:58:17.000]  800-686-2237.
[3:58:17.000 --> 3:58:21.000]  Ted Anderson standing by to take your call or answer your questions.
[3:58:21.000 --> 3:58:22.000]  One coin, 100 coins.
[3:58:22.000 --> 3:58:23.000]  They're happy to talk to you.
[3:58:23.000 --> 3:58:24.000]  No pressure.
[3:58:24.000 --> 3:58:26.000]  800-686-2237.
[3:58:26.000 --> 3:58:28.000]  Thank you so much for the report, Ted.
[3:58:28.000 --> 3:58:29.000]  Yeah, you bet.
[3:58:29.000 --> 3:58:37.000]  Great job, crew, today out of the park for Jaren, Hartman, Bill, Matt, everybody.
[3:58:37.000 --> 3:58:38.000]  God bless you.
[3:58:38.000 --> 3:58:39.000]  Retransmission starts now.
[3:58:39.000 --> 3:58:42.000]  Spread the word about the show as we fight the globalists.
[3:58:42.000 --> 3:58:45.000]  You are listening to GCN.
[3:58:45.000 --> 3:58:51.000]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[3:58:51.000 --> 3:58:52.000]  Hello, friends.
[3:58:52.000 --> 3:58:55.000]  This is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[3:58:55.000 --> 3:58:57.000]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[3:58:57.000 --> 3:59:01.000]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor,
[3:59:01.000 --> 3:59:06.000]  they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[3:59:06.000 --> 3:59:08.000]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer,
[3:59:08.000 --> 3:59:11.000]  reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[3:59:11.000 --> 3:59:13.000]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[3:59:13.000 --> 3:59:18.000]  The Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control
