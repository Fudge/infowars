[00:00.000 --> 00:04.740]  Gavin McInnis is back with his all-new online network, FreeSpeech.tv.
[00:04.740 --> 00:28.740]  Gavin McInnis, Joe Biggs, Miley Unopolis, and Soph, all at FreeSpeech.tv.
[00:34.740 --> 00:40.740]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:40.740 --> 01:01.740]  What we are looking at is good and evil, right and wrong.
[01:01.740 --> 01:24.740]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this Wednesday, October 23rd, 2019 broadcast.
[01:24.740 --> 01:38.740]  Remember, the establishment really doesn't want this show on the air because they have a lot of really bad, horrible, anti-human, nasty things they want to carry out against you and your family.
[01:38.740 --> 01:59.740]  And if you unconsciously just put up with it, you will be destroyed. But first, you will have your psyche misdirected and stolen by these individuals who are attempting to take your energy, your soul, your spirit with them to a very, very bad place.
[01:59.740 --> 02:08.740]  It's all about a war for your soul. That's it. Period.
[02:08.740 --> 02:37.740]  Now, we obviously have the latest developments taking place on a lot of different fronts. And we have the latest rerun of The Whistleblower hoax with the diplomat, the lead diplomat, the ambassador to
[02:37.740 --> 02:49.740]  Ukraine saying he heard somebody say it was quid pro quo, just like the other fake whistleblowers whose names we can't know, lied and said that as well.
[02:49.740 --> 03:04.740]  And then even when he testified, Bill Taylor yesterday in his bomb show had to admit that when he got a call from the EU ambassador and told him that, he said, that's insane.
[03:04.740 --> 03:16.740]  Trump never said quid pro quo or that he better be given something because he's a businessman and that's how it works. And you want the money, you do something he wants.
[03:16.740 --> 03:22.740]  Trump's not insane. And you can tell Schiff wrote this latest statement this guy put out. I mean, it's so obvious.
[03:22.740 --> 03:35.740]  It's a redo of the fake letter that Schiff read. In fact, let's cue that up. Schiff reading the fake letter that was supposedly the fake transcript between the Ukrainian president and Trump.
[03:35.740 --> 03:46.740]  Remember that? Just go into YouTube. Anybody can type it in and just Schiff reads fake transcript, reads fake letter, fake Trump letter. It's amazing.
[03:46.740 --> 04:02.740]  So that's supposed to suck all the oxygen out of the room. That's what that's supposed to do. And then we're supposed to just focus on that and debate that all day and get all breathless about how Trump's going down.
[04:02.740 --> 04:22.740]  And while meanwhile, meanwhile, ladies and gentlemen, Trump is trying to end major wars, trying to win a trade war with China, trying to stabilize our economy and trying to reboot the American spirit.
[04:22.740 --> 04:34.740]  But under Trump's nose and under our noses, there's some things going on that I think you should know about. And I think that we should talk about.
[04:34.740 --> 04:42.740]  And we're going to do that on the other side. What's going on with the homeless?
[04:42.740 --> 04:53.740]  I'm going to cover something that's breaking, that's confirmed that you've never heard before. And the article's going up at infowars.com.
[04:53.740 --> 05:08.740]  As we speak, ladies and gentlemen, and we'll go over all of that as well. And then, and then, we're going to have Kerry Porch, the big CNN whistleblower, in studio, Robert Barnes.
[05:08.740 --> 05:20.740]  Hello, today on All Things Considered, I'm Wilbur Snakily to tell you all that there's been a lot of conspiracy theories out there that fluoride in your water is hurting you.
[05:20.740 --> 05:30.740]  Now, sure, the Journal of American Medical Association admits that it's causing some cancer and massive brain damage and infertility, but after all, isn't there too many people?
[05:30.740 --> 05:39.740]  That's right. Drink the fluoride. Don't visit infowarsstore.com and get the good halogen. I mean the bad halogen.
[05:39.740 --> 05:49.740]  Iodine, don't give it to yourself, your husband, your wife, your children. Just drink the fluoride and plunge into subservience to us.
[05:49.740 --> 05:59.740]  We don't want to compete with you. Just drink the fluoride. Don't learn about how deadly it is and whatever you do. Don't support Alex Jones.
[05:59.740 --> 06:07.740]  Remember, I'm speaking with a soft voice, so I'm a liberal. Oh, and let Namble have access to your children.
[06:30.740 --> 06:51.740]  It is Wednesday, October 23, 2019. I'm your host, Alex Jones, and we're live broadcasting worldwide. There's a couple of really important things I want to let you know.
[06:51.740 --> 07:01.740]  I am aware of information going on inside the Trump campaign that is very, very dangerous and very, very scary.
[07:01.740 --> 07:20.740]  To the President, to this country, and to all of you watching and listening out there, you may have noticed that to Brad Parscale earlier this week had a huge, lavish cover story in the Sunday New York Times about what a wonderful person he is and what a genius he is.
[07:20.740 --> 07:30.740]  Well, there's some interesting things going on with Brad Parscale that I'm going to reveal later on the broadcast today.
[07:30.740 --> 07:43.740]  We're going to have some written articles out about it tomorrow. Nothing against Brad Parscale, but quite frankly, the man is not the sharpest knife in the drawer.
[07:43.740 --> 07:53.740]  And it's a serious weak link, just like we told you that Fiona Hill was a Soros Mole who would then testify against Trump for some type of a quid pro quo operation.
[07:53.740 --> 07:59.740]  And two years later, you're witnessing it happen. Next year's news today, that is info wars.
[07:59.740 --> 08:08.740]  So if you want to be informed, this is the broadcast selling Donald Trump a first time campaign manager tries to defy the doubters.
[08:08.740 --> 08:19.740]  Well, well, well, that's a positive article about what a genius he is. We're going to be getting into that because that's the way Trump can be taken down.
[08:19.740 --> 08:26.740]  Now, that's big news, but that's nothing compared to what we're going to have on Friday.
[08:26.740 --> 08:41.740]  And again, I've probably gotten butterflies 10 times the 25 years I've been on air. When I had Donald Trump coming on the show, I did not get butterflies.
[08:41.740 --> 08:47.740]  I get butterflies when I think about the guests we're going to have Friday.
[08:47.740 --> 08:56.740]  It's a big guess. Joe Rogan had Edward Snowden on yesterday, but they released a few hours ago. That's great. It's posted up on info wars.com.
[08:56.740 --> 09:00.740]  That's a big guess. Not as big as Julian Assange would be. That's also a dangerous guess.
[09:00.740 --> 09:06.740]  So I was a hat tip. It's talking to Joe this morning. Hat tip to Joe for that big landed fish.
[09:06.740 --> 09:13.740]  This is a really important big interview. And it's an emergency message to the president.
[09:13.740 --> 09:23.740]  And I know my phones are getting listened to. So it's the kind of interview where I'm looking under my car literally now for bombs when I drive to work in the morning.
[09:23.740 --> 09:32.740]  And I've never done that before. So we got a big interview coming up Friday in the second hours where it's scheduled live.
[09:32.740 --> 09:39.740]  And you're going to want to tune into this. And if something happens to me, the interview is still going to go out.
[09:39.740 --> 09:46.740]  Folks know, by the way, I don't hype stuff. I just tell you how big something is and straight up deliver.
[09:46.740 --> 09:55.740]  And so if this individual relays the things they're going to relay, let's just say bombshell is an overused word. This is a bombshell of bombshells.
[09:55.740 --> 10:03.740]  Now, we have a CNN whistleblower. Carrie porch is going to be in studio coming up about 15 minutes the next hour.
[10:03.740 --> 10:10.740]  We'll ride shotgun for an hour, 45 minutes and coming in towards the middle of that constitutional lawyer and really smart guy.
[10:10.740 --> 10:16.740]  Good friend of mine, Robert Barnes is in studio and he'll have a lot of questions as well.
[10:16.740 --> 10:26.740]  So we'll be all in here co-hosting together. Then you've got the war room with Owen shroyer and you've got, of course,
[10:26.740 --> 10:36.740]  firepower coming up with will johnson and pappert and others and David night in the morning. Other shows will be adding soon. But let me just lay this out at you right now.
[10:36.740 --> 10:49.740]  We're going to cover a whole constellation of articles we've got here. But as soon as I saw this article and asked Daniels about 30 minutes ago to post it for showtime up on info wars.com.
[10:49.740 --> 11:03.740]  I knew that it's probably the biggest story you could even put on air as a signpost of where we're going. And because it's so huge, it will get no attention.
[11:03.740 --> 11:11.740]  If something's a nebulous theory, you can't prove it goes viral. People love stuff like that. But when it's in your face and real and so massive,
[11:11.740 --> 11:22.740]  the average person just goes, Well, what are you going to do about it? Well, we better do something about it because if you've watched ABC or CBS or NBC or any of these shows the last couple years,
[11:22.740 --> 11:33.740]  they go from saying, Alex Jones is crazy. Nobody wants to implant you with microchips to track you when you buy and sell to everyone's going to get a chip soon to buy and sell.
[11:33.740 --> 11:43.740]  It's just the way it is. And if you want to buy and sell, it's the social score. You're going to do it. And so Facebook is competing with a brain chip.
[11:43.740 --> 11:54.740]  Elon Musk is rolling a brain system out next year. And they say, Oh, it's going to be like plastic surgery just, you know, in and out an hour.
[11:54.740 --> 12:04.740]  So they're making it sound like you're getting, you know, a pedicure or something. It's not even a medical procedure, having a big corporation put wires in your brain.
[12:04.740 --> 12:13.740]  It's no big deal to, you know, if a father chops his son's finger off, he goes to prison, he should. But if mommy takes junior to have his penis cut off, it's liberal.
[12:13.740 --> 12:24.740]  It's not psychotic. It's not moon chosen by proxy. No, it's good. Wires in our brains, big corporations putting them in there and laughing at the AI will take us over.
[12:24.740 --> 12:31.740]  They're hiding it in plain view. Elon Musk and it'll soon take you over with his eyes all jacked as pupils all huge.
[12:31.740 --> 12:37.740]  I mean, he's on frickin five hits of LSD or is he already got a brain chip? They've already are wired up.
[12:37.740 --> 12:53.740]  And let me tell you something. I did some digging this morning right before it went live. The company that's in Austin, wait for it is doing it through a UN connected grant is microchipping the homeless in Austin.
[12:53.740 --> 13:03.740]  They've already done it in Mexico and in Guatemala. And now it's here. They target the children. They target the homeless.
[13:03.740 --> 13:15.740]  They target all timers. It's always the weakest stories up on info wars.com and news wars.com. Let's punch that up for folks so they can share that article.
[13:15.740 --> 13:21.740]  It's posted to info wars.com and news wars.com by Mike Adams of natural news.com.
[13:21.740 --> 13:35.740]  Now, here we are just calmly talking about all of this and how it's being rolled out. Just like, oh, Nambla, the UN says is good and sex with children is good and then bestiality is good.
[13:35.740 --> 13:44.740]  And taxpayers are going to make you pay for again cutting little kids genitals off and Islam is good. But Christianity is bad.
[13:44.740 --> 14:00.740]  This is the total takeover of society. This is the system. And we and the average person is just a spectator who just accepts all of this coming down to them, like the fluoride in the water, all the big studies, American Medical Journal, Harvard.
[14:00.740 --> 14:14.740]  They go, yeah, it does give you cancer and lowers your IQ and lowers your fertility and just absolutely screws you up massively, ladies and gentlemen.
[14:14.740 --> 14:19.740]  But that's okay. Roll over and die. We're going to keep it in the damn water.
[14:19.740 --> 14:34.740]  That much of lawsuits have been filed. So it's now out of children's toothpaste because the American Dental Association said eight years ago, don't brush children's teeth up until about age eight with fluoride because it causes dental fluorosis in the next set of teeth and makes them
[14:34.740 --> 14:42.740]  chalky. They always knew that it doesn't help your damn teeth. Doesn't help anybody. It's hydrofluoresic acid that eats holes in your brain.
[14:42.740 --> 14:50.740]  You wonder why everybody's so dumb and looks like zombies and they're so damn ugly. It's the fluoride.
[14:50.740 --> 15:04.740]  They take out the good halogen, the iodine. They put the bad one in and I get up here and sensationally lay it all out with the government documents, the periodic table, and try to launch a movement against it so that people understanding the fluoride out.
[15:04.740 --> 15:18.740]  They put iodine in and, yes, we sell the best, cleanest, best iodine out there, a symbiotic relationship, fund the InfoWare, and get the best X2, the best X3. X3 is great for kids. It's not as strong as the X2, but it's still excellent with tri-iodine.
[15:18.740 --> 15:29.740]  InfoWareStore.com. Get it with a bio-dry selenium. And, yeah, I've been hyping this saying it's the most important thing to do and we've seen some uptick in sales.
[15:29.740 --> 15:36.740]  Maybe a doubling. I know how big our audience is. This isn't about the money. Yes, it's about funding or operation to feed the globalists. It's symbiotic.
[15:36.740 --> 15:47.740]  But it's about the question of they want fluoride in you. It hurts you. This is the opposite. This is what you live off of. Do people get that we're not making this up?
[15:47.740 --> 15:55.740]  We're over the target. We're exposing the globalist. We're taking action. We're fighting hard.
[15:55.740 --> 16:00.740]  Now, the story's up on InfoWare.com with that headline. Report.
[16:00.740 --> 16:26.740]  City of Austin now microchipping the homeless. We'll give you the rest of the story when we come back.
[16:30.740 --> 16:37.740]  We'll give you the rest of the story when we come back.
[17:01.740 --> 17:07.740]  Right on the East Bank of the Mississippi. Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location.
[17:07.740 --> 17:15.740]  And rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[17:15.740 --> 17:23.740]  So here's what you should do right now. Check out the PPX Microgrid System at myownpowergrid.com. That's myownpowergrid.com.
[17:23.740 --> 17:31.740]  Over $1,000 in great off-the-grid gear and a ton of bonuses too. In the best part, you're not going to pay $750 or $500 or even $200.
[17:31.740 --> 17:54.740]  Go to myownpowergrid.com to learn more. That's myownpowergrid.com.
[18:01.740 --> 18:18.740]  It is now an admitted fact. Fluoride out of the water has caused tens of millions of Americans to be brain damaged and to have infertility and low IQs.
[18:18.740 --> 18:31.740]  And it doesn't matter if the Journal of American Medical Association comes out and says it's terrible, still the city's put it in the water because the ruling globalists want you and your family poisoned and stupid.
[18:31.740 --> 18:40.740]  And they sure don't want you to know about the good allergen, iodine, that absolutely increases IQ and fertility and makes life so wonderful and opens up your consciousness, your mind, everything.
[18:40.740 --> 18:49.740]  Thank God. Thank God. I discovered this eight years ago. Of course, the enemy knows all about it and they hope you don't discover it. They hope you just roll over and die.
[18:49.740 --> 18:56.740]  So whatever you do, don't visit mforestore.com and get 60% off right now on the Wake Up the World to the Iodine Conspiracy Combo.
[18:56.740 --> 19:04.740]  60% off with X2 and X3 together with your bottle of Biotrusilinium. Whatever you do, don't go to mforestore.com. Just give up America. Give up Christians.
[19:04.740 --> 19:10.740]  Drink your fluoride and die. Give in to Satan. Give him up.
[19:10.740 --> 19:22.740]  Here are the facts. Iodine raises IQ and across the board makes you more healthy in thousands of top studies, including the American Medical Journal.
[19:22.740 --> 19:28.740]  Every type of fluoride lowers IQ, massively increases cancer and destroys fertility.
[19:28.740 --> 19:36.740]  That's the facts. Learn about the iodine conspiracy and then once you've learned about it, protect yourself and your family.
[19:36.740 --> 19:42.740]  The reason I'm so hot on this is the globalists put the fluoride in the water while making sure we don't get the iodine.
[19:42.740 --> 19:48.740]  In China, they put the iodine in the water and ban the fluoride because they've already got their people under their control.
[19:48.740 --> 19:52.740]  The globalists are targeting us here. Please go to mforestore.com.
[19:52.740 --> 19:58.740]  Experience iodine and Biotrusilinium that goes with it together and then once you see the great results, warn others.
[19:58.740 --> 20:26.740]  This is the Achilles' Hill of the Globalist. It's a win-win situation. The only way you lose is not taking action. Take action now.
[20:26.740 --> 20:48.740]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. I am your host, Alex Jones.
[20:48.740 --> 20:58.740]  If you're a TV viewer, as you can see, there's the article at newswords.com. Report Austin Homeless being implanted with trackable microchips.
[20:58.740 --> 21:06.740]  Program rolled out in Latin America and third world countries now coming to Texas.
[21:06.740 --> 21:10.740]  And the nation is being hit with thousands of tons of fentanyl.
[21:10.740 --> 21:20.740]  Enough if you took an overdose of it to kill tens of billions of people, each shipment, and you've got people just laid out like the old opium dens in China
[21:20.740 --> 21:25.740]  on the sides of the street all over leftist blue cities.
[21:25.740 --> 21:33.740]  Think about that, ladies and gentlemen. Think about how incredibly dangerous that is and how humanity is being targeted
[21:33.740 --> 21:44.740]  and how medical doctors push all these different forms of opiates and impediments on the general population.
[21:44.740 --> 21:54.740]  Now, let me sit down here for a minute and start going over these articles and more detail for folks and then just tell the listeners what is coming up today
[21:54.740 --> 21:59.740]  and what's going to be unfolding here.
[21:59.740 --> 22:04.740]  I'm going to put together a special report for tomorrow that just has a compilation the last year.
[22:04.740 --> 22:08.740]  And I'm going to show you some of the articles where you can actually find the reports.
[22:08.740 --> 22:14.740]  ABC News, CBS News, Yahoo News, all the big establishment news, New York Times, Washington Post saying,
[22:14.740 --> 22:19.740]  you will get a microchip in the next few years to buy and sell.
[22:19.740 --> 22:23.740]  And you will get one in your brain. And it's just real easy.
[22:23.740 --> 22:29.740]  If you just get them all, it's like getting in pierced ears. It's no big deal. No big deal.
[22:29.740 --> 22:34.740]  You'll have a big mega corporation. Most of their systems based in China put a bunch of wires directly in your brain
[22:34.740 --> 22:38.740]  and have Elon Musk saying, don't worry, AI will take you over. That's a quote.
[22:38.740 --> 22:42.740]  But not right away. And then he started laughing.
[22:42.740 --> 22:47.740]  So, Austin Homeless being implanted with trackable chips.
[22:47.740 --> 22:57.740]  Mike Adams article posted up on infowars.com also with the live feed of the show.
[22:57.740 --> 23:02.740]  And it's all being pushed as vaccines. Oh, it's an implantable microchip vaccine.
[23:02.740 --> 23:14.740]  Everyone knows don't oppose vaccines. Vaccine now just means something being put into your body by the state, by the government.
[23:14.740 --> 23:23.740]  Something mandated that a government with a breakaway civilization mad scientist technocracy that was caught in Peru
[23:23.740 --> 23:27.740]  and caught in Nigeria and caught in the United States.
[23:27.740 --> 23:37.740]  The UN was caught putting all sorts of pathogens in vaccines like syphilis giving you live syphilis.
[23:37.740 --> 23:46.740]  But again, the media only told you about the black people. I guess that's institutional racism thinking, oh, it's just the black people.
[23:46.740 --> 23:55.740]  So this plan is absolutely rolling out in the past. It was secret, you know, five years ago, 10 years ago.
[23:55.740 --> 24:04.740]  Now it's all out in the open.
[24:04.740 --> 24:11.740]  Vaccines now being used to harvest biometric identities of everyone. Big brother merges with big pharma.
[24:11.740 --> 24:17.740]  That's what this is all about. And Google has basically been buying up big pharma. So has Facebook.
[24:17.740 --> 24:22.740]  This is the merger. You think it's just devices in your house that watch and listen to you and report on you?
[24:22.740 --> 24:28.740]  Oh, no, no, no, that's nothing. Mark Zuckerberg teases AI brain chip.
[24:28.740 --> 24:32.740]  But it'll be different than Elon Musk. That's the New York observer.
[24:32.740 --> 24:42.740]  Mexicans get microchips over kidnapping fears. New scientists. That was a decade ago.
[24:42.740 --> 24:51.740]  This company invests microchips in employees and they love it. Sweden's talking about making everyone do it to use mass transit for all taxi drivers.
[24:51.740 --> 24:57.740]  USA Today three years ago, you'll get chipped eventually.
[24:57.740 --> 25:03.740]  Why you're probably getting microchip implant someday. The Atlantic.
[25:03.740 --> 25:07.740]  Elon Musk hopes to put a computer in your brain. Who wants one?
[25:07.740 --> 25:14.740]  Singing in in July and must shows you how easy it is. And the headline was it's an easy procedure on Monday.
[25:14.740 --> 25:22.740]  AP was reporting on others. Star was reporting on as well. And there was the headline soon AI computers will be your judges.
[25:22.740 --> 25:26.740]  They'll be totally fair. Oh, really? Who programs them? What a joke.
[25:26.740 --> 25:32.740]  Oh, everything will be automated. The computer will decide what job you have or how long you live or how much healthcare you get.
[25:32.740 --> 25:41.740]  How wonderful. And the technocrats will program it all. What a nightmare on its face. Who would accept this? Who would want to be part of this?
[25:41.740 --> 25:49.740]  And now we have tens of thousands of homeless, the mayor saying, hey, they can sleep whatever they want, including, you know, basically in your yard.
[25:49.740 --> 25:54.740]  And then there's a big crisis and now they need medical care and now they did everything and they're just laid out on drugs.
[25:54.740 --> 25:59.740]  Most of them aren't even mentally ill. Used to get some homeless, hobos, mentally ill, folks that fell through the cracks.
[25:59.740 --> 26:05.740]  But now people just want to take their opium. They want to take their heroin. They want to take their oxy cotton.
[26:05.740 --> 26:11.740]  They want to take their fentanyl being shipped in by the Chinese government officially to sabotage the United States.
[26:11.740 --> 26:17.740]  And how dare Trump try to stop it? How dare him try to interdict it?
[26:17.740 --> 26:25.740]  Just how dare President Trump, because, again, enough fentanyl got caught coming into the U.S. to kill 10,608 million people.
[26:25.740 --> 26:30.740]  Remember that a few months ago? And we first hit the math here.
[26:30.740 --> 26:35.740]  And later I picked up nationally. They looked at it and said, yeah, this would kill. They said 11 billion people in the national news.
[26:35.740 --> 26:41.740]  They rounded up. They all took a killer dose, an overdose amount of that amount that came in.
[26:41.740 --> 26:47.740]  They broke it all up into one dose for each person that would be an overdose and kill 11 billion people.
[26:47.740 --> 26:54.740]  Well, there's only seven and a half billion people on this big blue ball spinning through. God knows what.
[26:54.740 --> 27:01.740]  So here we are, ladies and gentlemen, this is the real world. So I'll be talking more about this, but this is all being built up.
[27:01.740 --> 27:08.740]  It's been prepared and now the system's making its move. Sterilizing little boys in Texas at age seven. That's in the news.
[27:08.740 --> 27:15.740]  Men whimming, the women's sporting events everywhere. Men going in little girls' bathrooms with their schlongs hanging out.
[27:15.740 --> 27:23.740]  All of it just in your face. Killer recalling anybody that opposes their Russian agent, including Tulsi, all of this insanity.
[27:23.740 --> 27:30.740]  They're just doing it. They're coming after the family. They're coming after everything. They're making their move.
[27:30.740 --> 27:37.740]  They're admittedly spying on us all. And this technotronic ruling class believes they're above the law and Godlike.
[27:37.740 --> 27:44.740]  What a time to be alive. And Elon Musk and Zuckerberg are doing press conferences saying you'll come in a little medical thing.
[27:44.740 --> 27:50.740]  It only takes about an hour and we're going to put wires in your brain. Brain surgery.
[27:50.740 --> 27:58.740]  And it's all just a new phase. Yes, they've created our evolution, this evolutionary path into de-evolution, into a technocracy.
[27:58.740 --> 28:05.740]  And all the statistics show the phones and the wires and the computers all make us more depressed, more alone.
[28:05.740 --> 28:11.740]  The suicide rates in young people double. They just doubled. People are, well, struggling, you know why?
[28:11.740 --> 28:17.740]  Because the society's breaking down. It's being shut down. People don't have relationships. They don't exercise. They don't go outside.
[28:17.740 --> 28:27.740]  We don't have barbecues with the neighbors anymore. We watch TV shows or we click on phones all day for dopamine, but we're getting more sickly, more depressed.
[28:27.740 --> 28:32.740]  Our brains are being rewired the bad way. We've been given technology by design.
[28:32.740 --> 28:36.740]  One of the former heads of Facebook, Sean Parker, works for Zuckerberg.
[28:36.740 --> 28:42.740]  He said, we designed it to depress you and take control of your life. And now you have avatar bots that are your friends.
[28:42.740 --> 28:48.740]  Most of the friends on Facebook aren't real. And they're there to influence you and take control of you and make you more depressed.
[28:48.740 --> 28:53.740]  And then they get you deeper into the labyrinth. Until finally you check out and say, give me a pleasure chip.
[28:53.740 --> 28:57.740]  Make me a PKD wire head. Put me in the matrix. I want out of this.
[28:57.740 --> 29:06.740]  The matrix was mirroring Pentagon papers on this from the 70s. It didn't invent the ideas. We'll be right back.
[29:28.740 --> 29:34.740]  My blood pressure has normalized. My diabetes has totally improved.
[29:34.740 --> 29:41.740]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel. I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[29:41.740 --> 29:49.740]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[29:49.740 --> 29:57.740]  Order your two months supply today by calling 866-295-5305. That's 866-295-5305.
[29:57.740 --> 30:06.740]  Or order online hbextract.com. Heart and body extract 866-295-5305. Or hbextract.com.
[30:08.740 --> 30:16.740]  Again, I'm not talking down to the Info Wars audience, but I've been banging my head against a wall for a long time on this.
[30:16.740 --> 30:19.740]  And I'm talking about fluoride and I'm talking about I and I.
[30:19.740 --> 30:29.740]  Now, if you have a boat, a motorboat, let's say an old glass-tron boat, and you want to take it on the lake, you've got to have a lake to put it in.
[30:29.740 --> 30:34.740]  If you're a human being, you've got to have oxygen to live. Okay, it's the same thing.
[30:34.740 --> 30:40.740]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, the bad halogen is fluoride. That's why in every Western nation, they put it in the water.
[30:40.740 --> 30:45.740]  They're going to teach us Christians lay down and die. The chai comms don't put it in the water. They'd execute you if you did that.
[30:45.740 --> 30:53.740]  They put iodine in the water because it's the good halogen and increases fertility and lifespan and intelligence and everything else.
[30:53.740 --> 30:59.740]  So again, learn about the iodine conspiracy at infowarstore.com. We have all the documents and articles linked.
[30:59.740 --> 31:04.740]  And then get good iodine for yourself because the globalists are fighting to make sure you don't.
[31:04.740 --> 31:07.740]  Again, get iodine at infowarstore.com.
[31:08.740 --> 31:11.740]  Info Wars presents Alex Jones.
[31:11.740 --> 31:16.740]  In August of 2019, JAMA, or the Journal of the American Medical Association,
[31:16.740 --> 31:22.740]  the most prestigious came out and said, oh my gosh, just a little bit of fluoride in the water causes lowered IQs,
[31:22.740 --> 31:26.740]  massive infertility, and a lot of babies dying in the womb, and it causes cancer.
[31:26.740 --> 31:29.740]  That was just one of thousands of studies admitting this.
[31:29.740 --> 31:36.740]  You know, it's illegal to have even one part per billion in the water in places like California unless it's part of adding fluoride.
[31:36.740 --> 31:43.740]  And then they have a waiver and can add thousands of deadly chemicals to your water because the liberals love you
[31:43.740 --> 31:45.740]  and they want to sexualize your children.
[31:45.740 --> 31:51.740]  So whatever you do, drink lots of fluoride and don't get the thing that counters iodine at infowarstore.com.
[31:51.740 --> 31:54.740]  Drink fluoride and die.
[31:54.740 --> 31:57.740]  Drink fluoride, dirty Americans, and roll over.
[31:57.740 --> 32:01.740]  Do not visit infowarstore.com and get high quality iodine to counter it.
[32:01.740 --> 32:04.740]  No, roll over and die, dirty Americans.
[32:04.740 --> 32:08.740]  infowarstore.com forward slash show.
[32:08.740 --> 32:11.740]  Welcome back to NPR here today.
[32:11.740 --> 32:13.740]  I'm Wilbur Snakeland.
[32:13.740 --> 32:20.740]  I just want you to know that when you hear the intro of the show and it's the Rockefeller Foundation and the Carnegie Foundation,
[32:20.740 --> 32:26.740]  don't look into the 1920s and 30s documents where they said that to be free from war,
[32:26.740 --> 32:36.740]  we must end the family and masculinity and that we must put chemicals in the food and water to make the men subservient and the women infertile.
[32:36.740 --> 32:46.740]  A real terrorist, Alex Jones, has been on air with that gravely evil male voice telling you to look into how iodine's good for your body and essential
[32:46.740 --> 32:48.740]  and how fluoride's bad.
[32:48.740 --> 32:51.740]  Listen, that's a conspiracy theory, okay?
[32:51.740 --> 32:53.740]  There's no medical journals.
[32:53.740 --> 32:54.740]  There's no facts.
[32:54.740 --> 32:56.740]  You need fluoride.
[32:56.740 --> 33:25.740]  Make extra fluoride and then you don't have to think anymore and just go to sleep when I talk to you real soft like this.
[33:26.740 --> 33:31.740]  Testing worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[33:31.740 --> 33:35.740]  I'm just an average man with an average life.
[33:35.740 --> 33:37.740]  I work from nine to five.
[33:37.740 --> 33:39.740]  Hell, I pay the price.
[33:39.740 --> 33:43.740]  All I want is to be left alone in my average home.
[33:43.740 --> 33:51.740]  But why do I always feel like I'm in the twilight soon and I'd always feel like somebody's watching me.
[33:51.740 --> 33:56.740]  The article's live at infowars.com and it's got the company there bragging about it.
[33:56.740 --> 34:01.740]  They've been implanting the homeless with microchips for years down in Latin America and now they're doing it here.
[34:01.740 --> 34:09.740]  It gives them privacy, it says, part of the blockchain and their medical records and they just scan.
[34:09.740 --> 34:21.740]  That article's at infowars.com and newswars.com from the great researcher and incredible investigative journalist Mike Adams.
[34:21.740 --> 34:22.740]  What a sleuth, ladies and gentlemen.
[34:22.740 --> 34:27.740]  Now, let me tie it in to the attack on the heart of America.
[34:27.740 --> 34:28.740]  You know, they want your guns.
[34:28.740 --> 34:29.740]  They admit they're going to take your guns.
[34:29.740 --> 34:30.740]  That's their plan.
[34:30.740 --> 34:31.740]  They want your children.
[34:31.740 --> 34:32.740]  They want it all.
[34:32.740 --> 34:34.740]  They're called control freak authoritarians.
[34:34.740 --> 34:36.740]  Well, look right here.
[34:36.740 --> 34:40.740]  Men arrested for speech in Connecticut.
[34:40.740 --> 34:46.740]  Men were charged under Connecticut statute, making it a crime to ridicule certain people.
[34:46.740 --> 34:51.740]  Someone caught them in a parking lot out a window.
[34:51.740 --> 34:55.740]  It looks like maybe singing a rap song or something.
[34:55.740 --> 35:00.740]  And it looks like these guys are not even from the U.S. recently.
[35:00.740 --> 35:05.740]  So it's popular, obviously all over the world, especially the Middle East, to sing rap songs.
[35:05.740 --> 35:09.740]  I guess they didn't get the memo that you can't sing songs.
[35:09.740 --> 35:11.740]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, they're banning all the speech.
[35:11.740 --> 35:17.740]  And it's the same Democrats in Connecticut shooing me wanting to overturn the First Amendment.
[35:17.740 --> 35:19.740]  This is real tyranny.
[35:19.740 --> 35:23.740]  UConn students arrested for ridiculing speech.
[35:23.740 --> 35:24.740]  That's right.
[35:24.740 --> 35:25.740]  You can't ridicule.
[35:25.740 --> 35:32.740]  Tyranny 2.0, Proud Boys sentenced to four years in prison for defending themselves from antifa attack.
[35:32.740 --> 35:39.740]  There's also folks trying to pass laws banning the word bitch.
[35:39.740 --> 35:42.740]  Now, it's on record the Proud Boys were followed, attacked.
[35:42.740 --> 35:44.740]  Some of the antifa was arrested, attacking others.
[35:44.740 --> 35:47.740]  But because these guys fought back and kicked their butt,
[35:47.740 --> 35:53.740]  well, fighting back a leftist method is the greatest crime there is, fighting back against a bully.
[35:53.740 --> 36:00.740]  And so they're facing now major prison sentences and were railroaded in the deep blue sea of New York City.
[36:00.740 --> 36:02.740]  They've got me in the deep blue sea of Connecticut.
[36:02.740 --> 36:05.740]  They've got Roger Stone in 12 days.
[36:05.740 --> 36:10.740]  Those in front of Obama's hanging judge getting railroaded.
[36:10.740 --> 36:17.740]  In DC, the deepest of the deep blue, Davey Jones' locker where patriots go to prison.
[36:17.740 --> 36:23.740]  So here's a short clip of the video that was shot by the person that complained.
[36:23.740 --> 36:27.740]  And reportedly, it might have been the end where we don't get to hear it.
[36:27.740 --> 36:31.740]  It's just too dangerous for us evil Americans, once the bastion of free speech.
[36:31.740 --> 36:39.740]  And so these guys are walking along together, saying the verboten word, but a good citizen caught it.
[36:39.740 --> 36:45.740]  There's a big investigation. Everyone's panicking in fear right now at the university. Here it is.
[36:45.740 --> 36:59.740]  Well, this is just incredible. We might as well just end the planet at this point.
[36:59.740 --> 37:03.740]  And of course, these are the same universities banning Halloween parties, just someone might get offended.
[37:03.740 --> 37:11.740]  But don't worry, the ADL came out and said the OK symbol that law enforcement uses, that divers use,
[37:11.740 --> 37:16.740]  that the International Sign Language Association has used for over 100 years.
[37:16.740 --> 37:21.740]  All the times Obama did this, well, it's OK, the ADL says he can do it. You just can't do it.
[37:21.740 --> 37:26.740]  OK, and of course, in the NBA, there's a popular clothing line with the three-point symbol.
[37:26.740 --> 37:33.740]  It's OK, black guys wear it, but if the ADL decides you're going to lose your bank accounts, you're going to go to jail.
[37:33.740 --> 37:37.740]  Because, you know, there are bosses, and the Southern Primary Law Center is our boss as well.
[37:37.740 --> 37:44.740]  So men arrested for speech in Connecticut, and we'll get to the Proud Boys, and they're sentencing here in a moment.
[37:44.740 --> 37:52.740]  We'll get Gavin McGinnis on the next few days, founder of this evil fraternal organization that says they'll just simply fight back if they're physically attacked.
[37:52.740 --> 38:03.740]  So Norm Pattis, famous constitutional lawyer, famous criminal lawyer, famous defense lawyer, joins us to talk about this case there in Connecticut.
[38:03.740 --> 38:07.740]  I mean, microchipping the homeless, Zuckerberg announcing brain chips for your children.
[38:07.740 --> 38:13.740]  Elon Musk says, oh, it's like getting your ears pierced so easy. Everybody's getting it.
[38:13.740 --> 38:18.740]  I mean, we're not in Kansas anymore. Here are we, Norm?
[38:18.740 --> 38:24.740]  No, that's right. I mean, I was going to say that's right, Koto, but I'm standing with you. These are scary times.
[38:24.740 --> 38:28.740]  I didn't even realize that Connecticut had a statute that reads as follows.
[38:28.740 --> 38:39.740]  A person commits a ridicule, this crime, if he ridicules any person or class of people on account of pre-religion color, denomination, nationality, or race.
[38:39.740 --> 38:43.740]  And, you know, you can go to prison for up to 30 days, and there's a fine.
[38:43.740 --> 38:51.740]  So I looked up ridicule. I wanted to know what it was, because as a lawyer, when you look at a statute, you want to say, are people unnoticed if that's prohibited?
[38:51.740 --> 38:59.740]  Ridicule means any contemptuous, excuse me, or dismissive language. Now, I've viewed the videotape any number of times.
[38:59.740 --> 39:06.740]  What I see are three guys walking through a parking lot apparently saying something that's been bleached out, but they don't appear to be saying it to anyone in particular.
[39:06.740 --> 39:11.740]  And I don't know the context. You suggested they may be singing a rap song. I simply don't know.
[39:11.740 --> 39:20.740]  But the notion that they were ridiculing any person, that they were engaged in conduct, it could cause a person to feel so alarmed that they need to declare a crisis
[39:20.740 --> 39:25.740]  and virtually shut the campus down to talk about these things is shocking to me.
[39:25.740 --> 39:33.740]  So our word, we're some removed from Yukon here. We're probably 60, 70 miles away, but we're hoping the phone rings in one of these kids' calls.
[39:33.740 --> 39:41.740]  Because I think this case is right for a constitutional challenge. This country has always had a robust commitment to freedom of speech, even offensive speech.
[39:41.740 --> 39:45.740]  And the N-word is one of those words which is context-driven.
[39:45.740 --> 39:52.740]  If a black person says to another person, yo, nigga, what up, that's fine. If I walk up to a black person and say, yo, nigga, what up, that's a crime.
[39:52.740 --> 40:01.740]  And so what makes this word offensive is the context in which it is used, and that gives the person offended, the ability to turn the honor off with.
[40:01.740 --> 40:16.740]  And by the way, ethnic, mainly a white lawyer famously said that in the OJ trial to get the mainly black jury to racially think about the racial connotations, and you're a famous defense lawyer as well.
[40:16.740 --> 40:20.740]  But we've even gotten to the point where they're trying to say, lawyers can't say this wholly all-powerful word.
[40:20.740 --> 40:28.740]  But now, again, they've moved on to the OK hand sign. They've moved on to basically everything else.
[40:28.740 --> 40:33.740]  How do we know these guys didn't just see small at something? We have a lot of folks that do this to create fear on campuses.
[40:33.740 --> 40:46.740]  I'm not saying they did, but the names, Mujuga, I mean, these guys have names that don't sound like, I mean, and they don't look or act like white guys either.
[40:46.740 --> 40:52.740]  I mean, my whole point is, is that could these have been false flaggers or people just trying to tease folks?
[40:52.740 --> 40:58.740]  Because we know most of this on campus turns out to be that. And then they place it on their own petard.
[40:58.740 --> 41:08.740]  Maybe. I think they were three guys out who got a little crock, probably, and were on their way home, doing what kids have done for time in Memorial on college campuses on the weekend, blowing off steam.
[41:08.740 --> 41:13.740]  But the Connecticut's NAACP has really descended into a species of madness.
[41:13.740 --> 41:20.740]  One of the people very responsible for setting its direction has a lawsuit ending in Massachusetts.
[41:20.740 --> 41:25.740]  Now, listen to this. Here's what the lawsuit is. A picture taken of a slave in 1850.
[41:25.740 --> 41:31.740]  1850 has been used to advertise books at Harvard University Press for a century or more.
[41:31.740 --> 41:40.740]  She's decided that she's related to this man. And so she's filed a suit against Harvard University Press demanding that the press turn over the photos,
[41:40.740 --> 41:45.740]  acknowledge her ancestry to the man and pay her unspecified money damage. Really?
[41:45.740 --> 41:50.740]  I mean, I don't know how this suit has survived more than a nanosecond in court.
[41:50.740 --> 42:02.740]  I happen to know the young woman who brought the suit. She allegedly was responsible for turning the NAACP on me when I posted earlier this year on Facebook,
[42:02.740 --> 42:10.740]  a picture of a white, several white Coors beer cans surrounding a black, a brown Budweiser bottle in a hood and said,
[42:10.740 --> 42:18.740]  Ku Klux Kour, to see what the reaction was. The reaction was, I got a call from a judge who said the NAACP was trying to get me arrested.
[42:18.740 --> 42:24.740]  They wanted to attack my law license. They thought I had engaged in hate speech. And I was so outraged.
[42:24.740 --> 42:29.740]  And let's be clear. We have to exercise the speech where we're going to lose it.
[42:29.740 --> 42:38.740]  The NAACP, the ADL, the Southern Barbara Law Center are now completely anti-American organizations trying to outlaw the OK symbol.
[42:38.740 --> 42:45.740]  These people are out of control. Norm Pattis, I want to come back and ask you where you think this is going and how we stop it.
[42:45.740 --> 42:51.740]  And of course, now if you misgender somebody with all that kooky 500 genders in California, they arrest you.
[42:51.740 --> 42:59.740]  And arrest have begun, ladies and gentlemen. And then coming up, the stories on infowars.com, they started microchipping the homeless.
[42:59.740 --> 43:07.740]  And coming up in a few months, Elon Musk says, go to the mall, you and your daughter, your son, you can get wires from his company shoved into your brain.
[43:07.740 --> 43:19.740]  Hello, today on All Things Considered, I'm Wilbur Snakily to tell you all that there's been a lot of conspiracy theories out there that fluoride in your water is hurting you.
[43:19.740 --> 43:27.740]  Now, sure, the Journal of American Medical Association admits that it's causing some cancer and massive brain damage and infertility.
[43:27.740 --> 43:32.740]  But after all, isn't there too many people? That's right. Drink the fluoride.
[43:32.740 --> 43:38.740]  Don't visit infowars.com and get the good halogen. I mean the bad halogen iodine.
[43:38.740 --> 43:47.740]  Don't give it to yourself, your husband, your wife, your children. Just drink the fluoride and plunge into subservience.
[43:47.740 --> 43:52.740]  We don't want to compete with you. Just drink the fluoride.
[43:52.740 --> 43:58.740]  Don't learn about how deadly it is and whatever you do. Don't support Alex Jones.
[43:58.740 --> 44:07.740]  Remember, I'm speaking with a soft voice, so I'm a liberal. Oh, and let Namble have access to your children.
[44:07.740 --> 44:12.740]  Please listen to this information because it can save your life and it can save the life of others.
[44:12.740 --> 44:20.740]  There couldn't be more critical information for your physical body. God's more important when it comes to your soul, but this is most important when it comes to your body.
[44:20.740 --> 44:30.740]  If people didn't know that you put motor oil in a car's oil container to lube the engine, they might be able to be conned and think you put salt water in it,
[44:30.740 --> 44:33.740]  but it would seize up the engine pretty much instantly.
[44:33.740 --> 44:38.740]  Well, if they put fluoride in the human body, it causes cancer, dumps us down and destroys fertility.
[44:38.740 --> 44:46.740]  If you put the good halogen in the body, high quality iodine, it's like putting good, high quality motor oil in the car that's supposed to run on it.
[44:46.740 --> 44:53.740]  It's that simple. Find out about the iodine conspiracy at m4store.com and find out what the globalists hope that you do not research this information.
[44:53.740 --> 44:59.740]  Ladies and gentlemen, whatever you do, research iodine deficiency. It's the key to everything.
[44:59.740 --> 45:07.740]  And then go and take advantage of the 60% off combo with our two different types of high quality iodine and bio-trustillinium at m4store.com today.
[45:07.740 --> 45:22.740]  Here are the facts. Iodine raises IQ and across the board makes you more healthy in thousands of top studies, including the American Medical Journal.
[45:22.740 --> 45:28.740]  Every type of fluoride lowers IQ, massively increases cancer and destroys fertility.
[45:28.740 --> 45:32.740]  That's the facts. Learn about the iodine conspiracy.
[45:32.740 --> 45:42.740]  And then once you've learned about it, protect yourself and your family. The reason I'm so hot on this is the globalists put the fluoride in the water while making sure we don't get the iodine.
[45:42.740 --> 45:48.740]  In China, they put the iodine in the water and ban the fluoride because they've already got their people under their control.
[45:48.740 --> 45:56.740]  The globalists are targeting us here. Please go to m4store.com, experience iodine and bio-trustillinium that goes with it together.
[45:56.740 --> 46:02.740]  And then once you see the great results, warn others. This is the Achilles' Hill of the Globalist. It's a win-win situation.
[46:02.740 --> 46:05.740]  The only way you lose is not taking action. Take action now.
[46:08.740 --> 46:16.740]  Now, what I'm about to say is incredibly obvious and I'm not talking down to any of the viewers or any of the listeners. I'm just taking the facts.
[46:16.740 --> 46:23.740]  I own a chainsaw. I've had it since I was in college. And it's a great, good old chainsaw and I've used it probably 500 times.
[46:23.740 --> 46:29.740]  But a few times I've forgotten to oil it and it seizes up really quick and I feel like an idiot for not oiling it.
[46:29.740 --> 46:37.740]  Now, imagine if somebody told me to put, let's say, super glue in the oil container on it. It would seize up forever.
[46:37.740 --> 46:43.740]  But only an evil person would do that. Well, fluorides like putting super glue in a chainsaw, it's going to make it seize up.
[46:43.740 --> 46:48.740]  And that's why they put it in the water and they admit they're doing it to hurt you and your family. Yes, they're really evil.
[46:48.740 --> 46:54.740]  Iodine is like putting oil in the chainsaw to help with the gasoline lubrication. It's that simple.
[46:54.740 --> 46:59.740]  I know you understand this, but let's warn other people before it's too late. It's part of the iodine conspiracy.
[46:59.740 --> 47:04.740]  Find out more at m4store.com and take action against the globalist.
[47:04.740 --> 47:19.740]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:34.740 --> 47:40.740]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[47:40.740 --> 47:46.740]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[47:46.740 --> 47:56.740]  You know, one reason I want to stay on air is because we put out a lot of critical breaking news that percolates up into the mainstream and goes through the electronic Berlin Wall.
[47:56.740 --> 48:07.740]  When the deep state, the big corporations don't want the information out there. So many big stories that are pro-human that really stop a lot of corruption and evil originate here at Infowars.
[48:07.740 --> 48:14.740]  That's why they want this broadcast shut down. But listen, I don't want to just continue on.
[48:14.740 --> 48:24.740]  I want to set up a DC bureau. I want to set up some other bureaus because Zuckerberg sneaks in to these testimonies and you only learn about it the day of.
[48:24.740 --> 48:28.740]  We had to get somebody in DC. We had it with Corsi.
[48:28.740 --> 48:35.740]  Stuff really didn't happen there. And now he and Larry claiming for him are suing me. Yes, that's right.
[48:35.740 --> 48:39.740]  So no good d goes unpunished there. Whatever, I forgive them.
[48:39.740 --> 48:48.740]  But the point is, is that we need to get a good team in DC, at least two people, a reporter and then a camera person to shoot reports every day.
[48:48.740 --> 49:00.740]  And that takes money. Instead, I'm looking at do I lay people off next year or do we just shut down because I'm selling products right now without ordering the replacements for some of them.
[49:00.740 --> 49:06.740]  Now, we hold back some of our folks that are on auto ship, but that's the position I'm getting into.
[49:06.740 --> 49:11.740]  So listen, I want to thank all the listeners and viewers, but we're under globalist attack and this information is vital.
[49:11.740 --> 49:21.740]  It's vital that we stay on air. So please go to infowarstore.com and get our wake up America coffee. If you like it, sign up for auto ship, the additional 10% off, cancel any time for free.
[49:21.740 --> 49:26.740]  And then every month or every two months or every three months up to every nine months, you can set it.
[49:26.740 --> 49:30.740]  It comes to your door. You don't forget to support us. You don't forget to get the great product.
[49:30.740 --> 49:35.740]  Sign up for auto ship on the fluoride free, colloidal silver, iodine fortified, super blue toothpaste.
[49:35.740 --> 49:43.740]  Sign up for the fish oil or the krill oil or we all love for the children, the honor roll.
[49:43.740 --> 49:54.740]  It's all there. And yes, folks, I was sitting back a few weeks ago looking at a stack of studies and even the New York Times and Washington Post reporting that massive cancer increases, massive IQ reductions,
[49:54.740 --> 50:02.740]  massive infertility and babies dying in the womb from their mothers being deficient in iodine and all these health problems for adults and they know it.
[50:02.740 --> 50:07.740]  So I launched the iodine conspiracy challenge globally.
[50:07.740 --> 50:13.740]  You can get bio tricillinium from mustard seeds, super strong, works electrochemically in the body.
[50:13.740 --> 50:17.740]  Got to have selenium as well to live. One of the other things that's missing.
[50:17.740 --> 50:25.740]  With X3, it's got the deep breath crystal iodine, the other two types of iodine from a clean form of it, very hard to find that.
[50:25.740 --> 50:31.740]  Some people need the triadine, others just need the deep breath crystal iodine, but it's got the deep breath crystal, pure atomic iodine, potassium iodine.
[50:31.740 --> 50:35.740]  And sodium iodine. That's what X3 is about.
[50:35.740 --> 50:42.740]  X2 is just pure deep breath crystal iodine. You get both bottles of it, and the selenium 60% off.
[50:42.740 --> 50:47.740]  And most people start detoxing in two to three weeks on it. Consult your physician.
[50:47.740 --> 50:52.740]  Look, it's on the periodic table. It's a good halogen. You die without it.
[50:52.740 --> 50:54.740]  No iodine, you die.
[50:54.740 --> 51:01.740]  But first, you degenerate. But if you haven't met on it most of your life and you get on it, there can be some fireworks.
[51:01.740 --> 51:09.740]  So go look at the thousands of five-star reviews, 98% review on the X2, and check it out today and just experience what I'm talking about.
[51:09.740 --> 51:16.740]  Going back to Norm Pattis, Norm is also our lawyer on the whole Sandy Hook situation in Connecticut with the Democrat law firm.
[51:16.740 --> 51:20.740]  Most powerful in the state, Senator Blumenthal's son's there.
[51:20.740 --> 51:25.740]  They've stated it's the kill shot. They want to take me off the air. You see it's Connecticut arresting people.
[51:25.740 --> 51:31.740]  Saying, if you ridicule someone, you'll be arrested. The NAACP wants my lawyer arrested. He's a famous liberal.
[51:31.740 --> 51:38.740]  He's a liberal, but not a leftist. They want him arrested for his speech. These people mean business.
[51:38.740 --> 51:42.740]  So, Norm, where do you see this madness going? Because you're right.
[51:42.740 --> 51:48.740]  It's a madness by the low-level folks involved, but higher-ups, they've taken free speech in China.
[51:48.740 --> 51:51.740]  They've taken free speech in Europe. They've taken free speech in England.
[51:51.740 --> 51:56.740]  This formula has worked before. If people submit to it, where do you think it's going?
[51:56.740 --> 52:01.740]  It's hard to know. I mean, it's hard to know exactly where we at. I'd like to recommend it to your listeners and viewers.
[52:01.740 --> 52:08.740]  Take a look at this book, The Madness of Crowd by Douglas Murray. He's a British author, and it's about gender, race, and identity.
[52:08.740 --> 52:15.740]  And the question he poses is, when did character stop mattering and identity become the sum and substance of politics?
[52:15.740 --> 52:20.740]  And how far can we press? And in his view, the identity politics is basically incoherent.
[52:20.740 --> 52:28.740]  He writes about the trans phenomena. At what point do we let a seven-year-old decide their gender, and what if they decide to go back?
[52:28.740 --> 52:38.740]  And at some point, do we all say that we have the right to set our own courses irrespective of what nature has to say, or irrespective of any broader limit?
[52:38.740 --> 52:45.740]  And it seems to me that we've become untethered. So I think the field option might say, this is exactly what you would expect when the pot says the potter.
[52:45.740 --> 52:52.740]  Why make this need us? And every person declares that they can be a god in their own right and remake themselves in any image they choose.
[52:52.740 --> 52:58.740]  That's always been possible at the perimeters of the society, but most societies have had a common conception of good.
[52:58.740 --> 53:05.740]  A sense of what things were acceptable and what was fighting for. I think we've lost that.
[53:05.740 --> 53:13.740]  We don't have a center that holds any more. And I hear that we are now at the point of disintegration of becoming undisunified.
[53:13.740 --> 53:18.740]  Oh, you're absolutely right, Norman. Your skype's breaking up. So let me give it a second to try to stabilize it.
[53:18.740 --> 53:24.740]  We've got anything running in the background. Please turn it off. But that's just a tip for anybody on skype.
[53:24.740 --> 53:28.740]  Last time it looked like HD, but that's just the way this stuff works.
[53:28.740 --> 53:33.740]  The Chai comms and the globalists wanted disillusion in the country. No borders, no wall, no USA at all.
[53:33.740 --> 53:39.740]  America was never great. It'll never be great. That's major democrat's statement, not just by the governor of New York.
[53:39.740 --> 53:48.740]  And so they want to break the country up. Global corporates are using America's openness and diversity to bring us down.
[53:48.740 --> 53:56.740]  Diversity can be a strength, but the way the left's running it, it is a weakness like the Tower of Babel to divide and conquer us.
[53:56.740 --> 54:01.740]  And that's in the WikiLeaks from Hillary. That's the cold-blooded mission. And they're betting against humanity.
[54:01.740 --> 54:08.740]  We're betting on humanity. And people need to understand how this scam works and defend what made America great.
[54:08.740 --> 54:16.740]  And that is free speech. How has the left, the supposed defenders always, which they really weren't, of free speech become its biggest enemy?
[54:16.740 --> 54:20.740]  I'm not so sure it's a left-right issue. I think it's a technology issue.
[54:20.740 --> 54:27.740]  I think AI and the rise of computing has given the invisible hand, in other words, the efficient allocator of resources, tangible form.
[54:27.740 --> 54:33.740]  And we now live at the mercy of algorithms that we don't understand. And the result is there's a lot of many of us who are surplus.
[54:33.740 --> 54:39.740]  And I think as people lose a sense of mattering, if they lose a sense that they have a connection to the broader social world,
[54:39.740 --> 54:43.740]  their idiosyncratic or individual identities become how they define themselves.
[54:43.740 --> 54:49.740]  And then the left mobilizes around identity and says, you know, we got room for everybody in our tent here.
[54:49.740 --> 54:53.740]  Our arc is big enough to include two of every just about anything. What do you want to be?
[54:53.740 --> 55:01.740]  I think the real threat is AI. I think Zuckerberg, when he talked in the Wall Street Journal and before at Georgetown the other day about becoming the fifth
[55:01.740 --> 55:11.740]  estate made an audacious claim. His view was that AI, social media, could have a role in the constitutional system similar to the executive branch,
[55:11.740 --> 55:17.740]  the judiciary, the legislative branch and the press. He was habituating us to subservient.
[55:17.740 --> 55:25.740]  And by the way, let's stop right there because when he announced a month ago, oh, we're going to have our own court that Facebook appoints.
[55:25.740 --> 55:33.740]  And then it will decide free speech on a global scale because it sprawls over all nations. It's the matrix. It's the skeleton of world government.
[55:33.740 --> 55:37.740]  And he's saying we're going to have corporate world government with a Chinese social score.
[55:37.740 --> 55:44.740]  And as you said, in that 44 minute speech that we critiqued here, he says we will have a role as a new branch of government.
[55:44.740 --> 55:49.740]  He means he's absorbing government, just like what he said a few years ago to newspapers.
[55:49.740 --> 55:54.740]  Well, you're all going to go bankrupt, but I'm going to hold your hand like you hold someone's hand at hospice.
[55:54.740 --> 56:01.740]  So that's what he's doing is he's guiding us, you know, you know, into hell. He's guiding us into the Inferno.
[56:01.740 --> 56:08.740]  Basically, it's incredible. I mean, who do you think Zuckerberg is and who he works for? Because he wants brain chips for your children.
[56:08.740 --> 56:09.740]  It's diabolical.
[56:09.740 --> 56:17.740]  Well, unfortunately, he's given us what at one level we want. I've got a very sophisticated smartwatch that tracks health data.
[56:17.740 --> 56:22.740]  I've given up some privacy because I enjoy the benefits of knowing how my heart is doing so.
[56:22.740 --> 56:28.740]  And, you know, and so we're sold cooperation with technology, emerging of the human.
[56:28.740 --> 56:29.740]  That Trojan horse.
[56:29.740 --> 56:34.740]  As a way of making our lives better without stopping to consider what we're sacrificing.
[56:34.740 --> 56:43.740]  So I pulled the plug on social media a year ago. I won't go back, but I haven't been able to disengage from the electronic world altogether because it's all around me.
[56:43.740 --> 56:46.740]  And again, we're not troglodytes. We're not against technology.
[56:46.740 --> 56:50.740]  This is all rolled out for takeovers for control of humanity.
[56:50.740 --> 56:51.740]  That's why it's so dangerous.
[56:51.740 --> 56:55.740]  And I'm glad you mentioned that part of Mark Zuckerberg speech because it was so incredible.
[56:55.740 --> 57:00.740]  Oh, we're going to defend speech by taking it away and we'll be the guardians and we'll be this new branch of government.
[57:00.740 --> 57:01.740]  Thank you so much.
[57:01.740 --> 57:04.740]  I really appreciate you, Norm Patis for joining us.
[57:04.740 --> 57:05.740]  I'll see you soon.
[57:05.740 --> 57:08.740]  All right, folks, we're going to come back.
[57:08.740 --> 57:13.740]  And I've never aired this Sargon of a Cod shooting range video. It's a few minutes long. I want to get it on there.
[57:13.740 --> 57:14.740]  It's interesting. It's fine.
[57:14.740 --> 57:17.740]  I didn't know they have the indoor tracers now. It's pretty amazing.
[57:17.740 --> 57:18.740]  I'm going to play that.
[57:18.740 --> 57:26.740]  And then when we come back at six after, I've really got to get focused because we have a video clip of Joe Biden talking about brain chips.
[57:26.740 --> 57:27.740]  I'm not kidding.
[57:27.740 --> 57:31.740]  It ties into the Austin homeless getting microchipped. How huge is that?
[57:31.740 --> 57:34.740]  It's all just the dams breaking. It's all rolling out.
[57:34.740 --> 57:40.740]  But again, I want to tell listeners for your own good, for all of our own futures, we can override this with human action.
[57:40.740 --> 57:45.740]  Tell everybody about the local radio stations you're listening to, TV stations, spread the word, keep doing it.
[57:45.740 --> 57:47.740]  Great job. We're overriding them.
[57:47.740 --> 57:49.740]  We're going to make it through this and it's going to make it stronger.
[57:49.740 --> 57:58.740]  And tell people about the streams at band.video, infowords.com, and the big CNN whistleblowers coming in as well.
[57:58.740 --> 58:05.740]  Hello here. My name is Buckleman. I work for my father, Lucifer.
[58:05.740 --> 58:11.740]  He doesn't like the fact that God gave you all families and children and so.
[58:11.740 --> 58:14.740]  We want to tell you something right now, Christian countries.
[58:14.740 --> 58:22.740]  We took control of you over 100 years ago. We've been spiking your water with fluoride to lower your fertility and to hurt you.
[58:22.740 --> 58:29.740]  And it's worked so well, but now because of liability and because of people warning inside the government what's happening,
[58:29.740 --> 58:34.740]  the Journal of American Medical Association and others are admitting what we've done.
[58:34.740 --> 58:41.740]  And it makes me so angry. So whatever you do, just stay in that haze and drink fluoride and give it to your children.
[58:41.740 --> 58:47.740]  And don't visit infowordsstore.com and learn about the iodine conspiracy.
[58:47.740 --> 58:54.740]  And get 60% off on X2 and X3 together with Biotrus selenium from the mustard seed. Submit to us.
[58:54.740 --> 59:12.740]  infowordsstore.com Welcome back to NPR here today. I'm Wilbur Snakely.
[59:12.740 --> 59:27.740]  I'm Wilbur Snakely.
[59:27.740 --> 59:38.740]  I'm Wilbur Snakely.
[59:38.740 --> 59:48.740]  Listen, that's a conspiracy theory, okay? There's no medical journals. There's no facts. You need fluoride. Just drink extra fluoride.
[59:48.740 --> 1:00:01.740]  And then you don't have to think anymore and just go to sleep when I talk to you real soft like this.
[1:00:01.740 --> 1:00:16.740]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:16.740 --> 1:00:32.740]  Run in there. You're good.
[1:00:32.740 --> 1:00:57.740]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:57.740 --> 1:01:04.740]  He wanted to come out and do some shooting. He's done some shooting before. And in most countries, this isn't happening for the general civilian population.
[1:01:04.740 --> 1:01:10.740]  So it's important to exercise this right while we still have it with Beto Roark saying he's coming with the guns.
[1:01:10.740 --> 1:01:13.740]  Yes, he does seem to be quite insistent in taking your guns.
[1:01:13.740 --> 1:01:20.740]  That's why we've got the Beto Notch shirt available at infowordsstore.com that helps support the Second Amendment and the First Amendment.
[1:01:20.740 --> 1:01:29.740]  We have a full automatic German G36 right there from Heckland Cock. We've got a Mossberg automatic shotgun, SPI pistol.
[1:01:29.740 --> 1:01:41.740]  We have a Falcor 9mm pistol with a Vortex sight. We have a Heckland Cock SP5K. And then we have a Zenus Z5 right here.
[1:01:41.740 --> 1:01:57.740]  Carl or Sargon has chosen the full auto rifle to fire first.
[1:01:57.740 --> 1:02:15.740]  How many times have you shot a 9mm handgun?
[1:02:15.740 --> 1:02:28.740]  Okay, well, you were two shots a little bit off target, but after that, you were dialed in. That's why they don't want people to go out and shoot, because it demystifies it. So he shot twice over here, still a stop to the attacker.
[1:02:28.740 --> 1:02:30.740]  And then after that, he was boomed right in there.
[1:02:30.740 --> 1:02:34.740]  Well, these were the first two shots, so I was just learning how the gun fell.
[1:02:34.740 --> 1:02:36.740]  Exactly, that's what I'm saying.
[1:02:36.740 --> 1:02:46.740]  It's all just a second nature.
[1:03:06.740 --> 1:03:16.740]  It's all just a second nature.
[1:03:16.740 --> 1:03:44.740]  It's all just a second nature.
[1:03:44.740 --> 1:03:58.740]  I see what you mean.
[1:03:58.740 --> 1:04:18.740]  We're here with Carl Benjamin, aka Sargon of Acod in Austin, Texas, exercising the Second Amendment while it's still around, with Beto saying, damn right I'm coming to your house with swatins to take your guns. And they said they've got something really special for us today.
[1:04:18.740 --> 1:04:24.740]  Supposing this looks like a laser beam when we were able to do it, so get ready for that. Are you excited, my friend?
[1:04:24.740 --> 1:04:31.740]  Very, actually. I've not seen how this fires on full auto, so I'm quite excited to see what the results could be.
[1:04:31.740 --> 1:04:39.740]  Full auto, 9mm tracer, indoors, stealth ammo, only in America, Beto is not liking that.
[1:04:39.740 --> 1:05:06.740]  I like that. Yeah, America! America, Beto, show it up here.
[1:05:06.740 --> 1:05:17.740]  Again, I'm not talking down to the Info Wars audience, but I've been banging my head against a wall for a long time on this, and I'm talking about fluoride, and I'm talking about iodine.
[1:05:17.740 --> 1:05:27.740]  Now, if you have a boat, a motor boat, let's say an old glass-tron boat, and you want to take it on the lake, you've got to have a lake to put it in.
[1:05:27.740 --> 1:05:32.740]  If you're a human being, you've got to have oxygen to live. Okay, it's the same thing.
[1:05:32.740 --> 1:05:38.740]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, the bad halogen is fluoride. That's why, in every Western nation, they put it in the water.
[1:05:38.740 --> 1:05:43.740]  They're going to teach us Christians lay down and die. The chai comms don't put it in the water. They'd execute you if you did that.
[1:05:43.740 --> 1:05:51.740]  They put iodine in the water because it's the good halogen, and increases fertility, and lifespan, and intelligence, and everything else.
[1:05:51.740 --> 1:05:57.740]  So again, learn about the iodine conspiracy at infowarstore.com. We have all the documents and articles linked.
[1:05:57.740 --> 1:06:05.740]  And then get good iodine for yourself because the globalists are fighting to make sure you don't. Again, get iodine at infowarstore.com.
[1:06:27.740 --> 1:06:34.740]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:06:57.740 --> 1:07:23.740]  Ladies and gentlemen, that was Joe Biden as a senator in 2005.
[1:07:23.740 --> 1:07:35.740]  That's even pre-Obama at the confirmation hearing of John Roberts to the Supreme Court of the United States, saying you will rule on brain chips.
[1:07:35.740 --> 1:07:45.740]  Well, this year, Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk both came out with competing brain chips and wires in your head.
[1:07:45.740 --> 1:07:54.740]  Of course, it's, oh, it's not even a medical procedure. Like, open heart surgery, it's not even a big deal either. Being hit by a bus is fine.
[1:07:54.740 --> 1:08:02.740]  You know, you don't need a parachute to jump out of an airplane. It feels good when you hit the bottom. By now, it's a good organization.
[1:08:02.740 --> 1:08:12.740]  There it is. And Mark Zuckerberg, you can ABC News, Reuters. Mark Zuckerberg wants you to put wires in your brain.
[1:08:12.740 --> 1:08:20.740]  Remember five years ago, Drudge popularized that photo and put a headline up there saying, is this our future?
[1:08:20.740 --> 1:08:31.740]  Try to find that photo, guys, on a lark. It's Zuckerberg at his virtual reality conference, and it's his employees all sitting there bent over, like, devolving.
[1:08:31.740 --> 1:08:37.740]  You know, we'd come up from the monkeys, supposedly, to an upright homo erectus, and then we'd start hunching over our computers back down.
[1:08:37.740 --> 1:08:44.740]  You've all seen those t-shirts. Well, there it is. And we certainly are devolving, aren't we?
[1:08:44.740 --> 1:08:51.740]  Regardless of what you think of Darwin's theory. And he's walking upright. He is a human. He is a God. He is a master.
[1:08:51.740 --> 1:09:00.740]  And you are plugged in to his world or something very sinister about the way he looks, the way he acts.
[1:09:00.740 --> 1:09:08.740]  I get the willies. And I get the willies about Elon Musk, who's going to be our protector against the brain chips.
[1:09:08.740 --> 1:09:14.740]  And I was like, you must all take it. Oh, oh, oh, I feel so good.
[1:09:14.740 --> 1:09:19.740]  And he and his engineers are sweating in their eyes. They're all jacked up. Pupers are all huge.
[1:09:19.740 --> 1:09:26.740]  Are they on hardcore and Fetiman? Or are they already chipped or are they wires?
[1:09:26.740 --> 1:09:34.740]  We know everything they're rolling out to us is 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 years old, depending on what the technology is.
[1:09:34.740 --> 1:09:40.740]  He said, oh, you're all going to get your chips and your brain next year with dozens of wires.
[1:09:40.740 --> 1:09:44.740]  It's so easy. It's no big deal. So wonderful.
[1:09:44.740 --> 1:09:53.740]  You know, California passed a law back in the 90s, Prop 65, that there's one part per billion of any toxin in anything.
[1:09:53.740 --> 1:10:05.740]  You can be sued. Now, there's hundreds of times the level of lead in an apple that is allowable in California.
[1:10:05.740 --> 1:10:11.740]  But there's waivers for California companies and people. Oh, yeah, you didn't know that for most of me.
[1:10:11.740 --> 1:10:15.740]  But then you ship stuff in, they shut you down.
[1:10:15.740 --> 1:10:25.740]  So they tested all of our stuff and got really pissed because all of it was California standard, which is really hard and almost no one can do it.
[1:10:25.740 --> 1:10:28.740]  But it didn't matter. I said, watch, they tested again.
[1:10:28.740 --> 1:10:34.740]  I know a couple of them barely were above it so they could sue me.
[1:10:34.740 --> 1:10:44.740]  And of course, it's well known if you just open a can of any vitamins in a parking garage, there's enough particular in there to make it go above the level.
[1:10:44.740 --> 1:10:50.740]  So, you know, when you first don't succeed, try, try again.
[1:10:50.740 --> 1:11:02.740]  The reason I raised that is they put hydrofluorosalic acid from toxic waste and have a waiver that up to 300 chemicals can be with it when they dump it in the California water.
[1:11:02.740 --> 1:11:10.740]  So the lawyers all know to leave that alone. Oh, actual poison that gives you brain cancer, lowers fertility, does all this admitted stuff.
[1:11:10.740 --> 1:11:15.740]  The American Medical Journal, you know, decades ago knew this. They knew it 100 years ago.
[1:11:15.740 --> 1:11:25.740]  But you notice you only hear about lawsuits against the local water authority because they have special waivers in immunity, just like the vaccine makers.
[1:11:25.740 --> 1:11:31.740]  They go, oh, you're just against science. You just don't want to get a learned immunity.
[1:11:31.740 --> 1:11:38.740]  No, I know you can really get vaccines that are clean and actually work. They still have side effects, but they're jacking things.
[1:11:38.740 --> 1:11:42.740]  They're building a post human world.
[1:11:42.740 --> 1:11:47.740]  And now the Austin homeless are getting chipped. I went and looked it up. Sure enough, the company does it in Latin America.
[1:11:47.740 --> 1:11:49.740]  They're doing it here.
[1:11:49.740 --> 1:11:52.740]  That story is on infowars.com right now.
[1:11:52.740 --> 1:11:57.740]  Austin homeless being implanted with travel Google Chips, but now it's like no big deal. See?
[1:11:57.740 --> 1:12:10.740]  It's like it's no big deal that the leftists are all buying big houses on the beach, even though they claim it's all flooding and going under. Here it is.
[1:12:10.740 --> 1:12:24.740]  In Hollywood, in the comic books growing up, the supervillains always hold the world hostage and promise to destroy it if you don't give into their demands to let them rule the planet.
[1:12:24.740 --> 1:12:28.740]  Because, again, like thinking the brain says, everybody wants to rule the world.
[1:12:28.740 --> 1:12:40.740]  Well, the Club of Rome, a group of powerful robber barons and billionaires, back in the 60s got together and they publicly wrote articles about this and said we want a way to unify the world into a world government.
[1:12:40.740 --> 1:12:53.740]  And to do that, we're going to make people the bad guys and carbon the bad guy, and then we'll get everyone to accept paying us carbon taxes and following all of our orders because we're the saviors of the earth.
[1:12:53.740 --> 1:13:01.740]  That's so sick. When somebody tells you do what I say or the world's going to end, they're a cult leader, they're a criminal, they're a threat to everybody.
[1:13:01.740 --> 1:13:13.740]  And they use the whole attack on carbon dioxide and the carbon taxes they want us to pay them as a way to divert away from the genetic engineering, the terminator seeds, the toxic waste dumping, all of it.
[1:13:13.740 --> 1:13:18.740]  These people know what they're doing, ladies and gentlemen. They want a post-human world.
[1:13:18.740 --> 1:13:27.740]  One of their adherents, of course, is Ted Turner, the founder of CNN, and he set up the Georgia Guidestones that calls for reducing the world down to 500 million people.
[1:13:27.740 --> 1:13:35.740]  And of course, these authoritarians, the savers of the earth, they're going to oversee it all. Here at M4 Wars, we're fighting back against this cult.
[1:13:35.740 --> 1:13:45.740]  We're fighting back against these people that are telling you that you're the bad guys, you've been cast as that, I've been cast as that, and they are the saviors of the earth.
[1:13:45.740 --> 1:13:53.740]  We're going to fly around on their private jets and live in palaces and have five kids, but you can't have a car, you can't have air conditioning, and you can't have children.
[1:13:53.740 --> 1:13:57.740]  This is a way to make slavery cool again, surf them cool again.
[1:13:57.740 --> 1:14:02.740]  And M4 War stands firmly against it, so whatever you do, remember, your destiny is in your hands.
[1:14:02.740 --> 1:14:09.740]  And when you spread the word about M4Wars.com for its last show and band.video, you shake these criminals to their very foundations.
[1:14:09.740 --> 1:14:14.740]  We've reached the tipping point. Press the attack. We will have a pro-human future.
[1:14:14.740 --> 1:14:20.740]  I don't think that we are discussing climate change the way we need to be discussed.
[1:14:23.740 --> 1:14:28.740]  We are in the midst of climate change right now, and it is only going to get worse.
[1:14:28.740 --> 1:14:31.740]  The world is going to end in 12 years if we don't address climate change.
[1:14:31.740 --> 1:14:39.740]  The scientists also tell us, have 12 years in which to answer that question. 12 years within which to act.
[1:14:39.740 --> 1:14:42.740]  Like, this is the war, this is our World War II.
[1:14:42.740 --> 1:14:45.740]  We have 12 years to turn this around.
[1:14:45.740 --> 1:14:50.740]  We are less than 12 years away from not being able to undo our mistakes.
[1:14:50.740 --> 1:14:51.740]  10 years we have left to us.
[1:14:51.740 --> 1:14:57.740]  Within the 10 years that we have left to us, we don't have more than 10 years to get this right.
[1:14:57.740 --> 1:14:59.740]  A little more than 10 years from now.
[1:14:59.740 --> 1:15:07.740]  There is no justice, and there is no combatting climate change without addressing what has happened to indigenous communities.
[1:15:07.740 --> 1:15:16.740]  I speak to you as a human being, a woman whose dreams of motherhood now taste bitter sweet because of what I know about our children's future.
[1:15:16.740 --> 1:15:21.740]  You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.
[1:15:21.740 --> 1:15:24.740]  This is about our lives. This is about American lives.
[1:15:24.740 --> 1:15:29.740]  That our community will be uninhabitable, not sustain human life along this current trajectory.
[1:15:29.740 --> 1:15:32.740]  I am here to say our house is on fire.
[1:15:32.740 --> 1:15:35.740]  It's a crisis that could, at its worst, lead to extinction.
[1:15:35.740 --> 1:15:38.740]  We are in the beginning of a mass extinction.
[1:15:38.740 --> 1:15:45.740]  People are dying. People are suffering. People are dying. How dare you?
[1:15:55.740 --> 1:15:59.740]  Brock and Michelle Obama, they are buying a house in Martha's Vineyard.
[1:15:59.740 --> 1:16:04.740]  I shouldn't say house. This is a massive, incredible beachfront estate.
[1:16:04.740 --> 1:16:07.740]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[1:16:07.740 --> 1:16:14.740]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[1:16:14.740 --> 1:16:22.740]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[1:16:22.740 --> 1:16:28.740]  Here, how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[1:16:28.740 --> 1:16:32.740]  My blood pressure has normalized. My diabetes has totally improved.
[1:16:32.740 --> 1:16:37.740]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[1:16:37.740 --> 1:16:39.740]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[1:16:39.740 --> 1:16:47.740]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[1:16:47.740 --> 1:16:52.740]  Order your two-month supply today by calling 866-295-5305.
[1:16:52.740 --> 1:17:04.740]  That's 866-295-5305, or order online hbextract.com, heart and body extract 866-295-5305, or hbextract.com.
[1:17:04.740 --> 1:17:10.740]  Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain, the hottest financial sector without all the speculation.
[1:17:10.740 --> 1:17:15.740]  No, enjoy a 27% annualized payment each month without the ups and downs of Bitcoin.
[1:17:15.740 --> 1:17:23.740]  Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an equipment leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace.
[1:17:23.740 --> 1:17:31.740]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[1:17:31.740 --> 1:17:42.740]  Not a security IPO or note, blockchain data centers have approved a turnkey equipment sale leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account each month.
[1:17:42.740 --> 1:17:50.740]  Don't miss this one, stake your claim today. Call 800-600-3388. That's 800-600-3388.
[1:17:50.740 --> 1:17:55.740]  These valuable lease contracts won't last long. Call now 800-600-3388.
[1:17:55.740 --> 1:18:05.740]  800-600-3388. Equipment offer poses a financial risk to owners consult with financial professionals before purchasing not an offer to buy or sell a security which requires an offering document.
[1:18:05.740 --> 1:18:13.740]  Now what I'm about to say is incredibly obvious and I'm not talking down to any of the viewers or any of the listeners. I'm just taking the facts.
[1:18:13.740 --> 1:18:20.740]  I own a chainsaw. I've had it since I was in college and it's a great good old chainsaw and I've used it probably 500 times.
[1:18:20.740 --> 1:18:27.740]  But a few times I've forgotten to oil it and it seizes up really quick and I feel like an idiot for not oiling it.
[1:18:27.740 --> 1:18:35.740]  Now imagine if somebody told me to put, let's say super glue in the oil container on it, it would seize up forever.
[1:18:35.740 --> 1:18:41.740]  But only an evil person would do that. Well, fluorides like putting super glue in a chainsaw, it's going to make it seize up.
[1:18:41.740 --> 1:18:45.740]  And that's why they put it in the water and they admit they're doing it to hurt you and your family.
[1:18:45.740 --> 1:18:51.740]  Yes, they're really evil. Iodine is like putting oil in the chainsaw to help with the gasoline lubrication.
[1:18:51.740 --> 1:18:57.740]  It's that simple. I know you understand this, but let's warn other people before it's too late. It's part of the iodine conspiracy.
[1:18:57.740 --> 1:19:01.740]  Find out more at m4store.com and take action against the globalist.
[1:19:01.740 --> 1:19:30.740]  Carbons everywhere on this planet. It's almost like we're carbon-based life forms.
[1:19:30.740 --> 1:19:40.740]  Don't visit m4store.com and get the good halogen. I mean the bad halogen. Iodine, don't give it to yourself, your husband, your wife, your children.
[1:19:40.740 --> 1:19:51.740]  Just drink the fluoride and plunge into subservience to us. We don't want to compete with you. Just drink the fluoride.
[1:19:51.740 --> 1:19:57.740]  Don't learn about how deadly it is and whatever you do, don't support Alex Jones.
[1:19:57.740 --> 1:20:05.740]  Remember, I'm speaking with a soft voice, so I'm a liberal. I wouldn't let Namble have access to your children.
[1:20:27.740 --> 1:20:45.740]  Gary Porch is in studio with us. Wow. He's the big CNN whistleblower that Project Veritas released information last week with.
[1:20:45.740 --> 1:20:52.740]  And now more and more is coming out. But he's just an interesting, smart guy, so I want to cover the waterfront with him here today.
[1:20:52.740 --> 1:20:57.740]  We'll open the phones up. We're going to have Robert Barnes a little bit later in the next hour in here with us, constitutional lawyer.
[1:20:57.740 --> 1:21:01.740]  He's also a big fan of Mr. Porch. Thanks for being here.
[1:21:01.740 --> 1:21:02.740]  My pleasure, Alex. How you doing?
[1:21:02.740 --> 1:21:08.740]  Good. I'm doing good. So what do you want to get into first? I've got a lot of things to cover, a lot of crazy news to get your take on.
[1:21:08.740 --> 1:21:11.740]  But what are some of the things you want to hit today?
[1:21:11.740 --> 1:21:22.740]  Not many things. Personally, just wanted to answer any questions that you and the viewers had about what I did, why I did, and what the next key steps are.
[1:21:22.740 --> 1:21:29.740]  I mean, as we know, the news cycle last week was pretty insane and almost no mainstream outside of Fox is covering it.
[1:21:29.740 --> 1:21:35.740]  I thought that was pretty interesting, especially with part four that has dropped yesterday, the Me Too CNN stuff.
[1:21:35.740 --> 1:21:41.740]  And again, that's getting buried as well. Tell folks about that. We're going to play that at the start of the next hour.
[1:21:41.740 --> 1:21:53.740]  So for those that don't know, part four dropped yesterday, I believe, and it was basically revealing some sexual assault allegations from some pretty high-up people in the organization.
[1:21:53.740 --> 1:22:02.740]  So obviously, everybody's trying to get some takes and responses, but they're obviously quiet. So I find that interesting.
[1:22:02.740 --> 1:22:08.740]  Do you think Jeff Zucker, the CEO who you expose, is having a political bias, wanting to take down Trump?
[1:22:08.740 --> 1:22:15.740]  We all knew that, but he claims he does it, but here he is in false advertising and Trump's false suit on him, or sort of that process.
[1:22:15.740 --> 1:22:23.740]  I bet they really don't like you sitting here in the ATX in studio with me because you were saying on air and off air, like, I was like the devil at CNN.
[1:22:23.740 --> 1:22:29.740]  Yeah, you were popular at CNN and other outlets for many different reasons, some good, some bad.
[1:22:29.740 --> 1:22:33.740]  Tell me all about it. I know on air they don't like me too much.
[1:22:33.740 --> 1:22:40.740]  Well, I mean, again, I'm a fairly relatively new consumer of the program and Owen and company like on YouTube.
[1:22:40.740 --> 1:22:48.740]  But it's just interesting because of all the hit pieces written about you from, you know, all the mainstream outlets to John Oliver, to a bunch of other people.
[1:22:48.740 --> 1:22:53.740]  You know, I just find that quite interesting. And now meeting you in person is very intriguing.
[1:22:53.740 --> 1:23:02.740]  I remember when I ran into him at one of the hearings and I tried to talk to him and Twitter said that's it.
[1:23:02.740 --> 1:23:11.740]  He's banned because he bullied a journalist and I said out there you go around and work to take me off the Internet and lie about me and target my sponsors.
[1:23:11.740 --> 1:23:22.740]  He just looks down like an evil possum and starts smiling at me and then they taught me you don't talk to a reporter in public about how he basically stalks you on air.
[1:23:22.740 --> 1:23:25.740]  Of course, he wasn't bullying me at all.
[1:23:25.740 --> 1:23:28.740]  He's bullying the movement in every one of your listeners.
[1:23:28.740 --> 1:23:33.740]  Again, I wasn't a journalist. I was just on the back end of things, very low level.
[1:23:33.740 --> 1:23:41.740]  But I always found it interesting where the media nowadays could go and just type and send out whatever they want to the term drive by media.
[1:23:41.740 --> 1:23:44.740]  They spread it far and wide as fast as they can.
[1:23:44.740 --> 1:23:54.740]  And once the truth comes out, whether it's, you know, in contradiction or not quite, you know, it's hardly any play versus the damage that's already been done.
[1:23:54.740 --> 1:24:04.740]  And just watching you and anyone else that even dares to confront, you know, a venerated journalist and then you guys get kicked off or censured or anything like that.
[1:24:04.740 --> 1:24:08.740]  Like to me, that's just, I can't even comprehend that.
[1:24:08.740 --> 1:24:12.740]  Like you can't confront people that, you know...
[1:24:12.740 --> 1:24:16.740]  Well, by the way, Oliver Darcy, I heard this years ago when we looked it up.
[1:24:16.740 --> 1:24:18.740]  He tried to get a job here like six, seven years ago.
[1:24:18.740 --> 1:24:19.740]  Oh, wow.
[1:24:19.740 --> 1:24:21.740]  He tried to work at Breitbart too. He was out in California.
[1:24:21.740 --> 1:24:24.740]  I know people that know him. And Chuck Johnson was telling me that.
[1:24:24.740 --> 1:24:26.740]  I thought Chuck was joking. We went and looked it up.
[1:24:26.740 --> 1:24:37.740]  So here's a guy tried to work here and now he goes to CNN and joins the dark side and then literally goes around policing everyone on the Internet like he's got.
[1:24:37.740 --> 1:24:38.740]  I know, and I find that...
[1:24:38.740 --> 1:24:44.740]  There it is. Old Tweakerville. CNN reporter used to mock network. CNN is, but now he's there.
[1:24:44.740 --> 1:24:46.740]  Now he's a big boy.
[1:24:46.740 --> 1:24:47.740]  And with a...
[1:24:47.740 --> 1:24:51.740]  Look at that face. Scroll down. Would you buy a used car from that gentleman, ladies and gentlemen?
[1:24:51.740 --> 1:24:57.740]  I'm sorry. I don't mean to be mean, but I mean, give me a break.
[1:24:57.740 --> 1:25:01.740]  It's a very interesting thing. I mean, I'm sure he has a pretty decent salary benefit package at the time.
[1:25:01.740 --> 1:25:09.740]  Like, you know, most Turner people do. I mean, it's just very interesting to watch how all these things unfold lately.
[1:25:09.740 --> 1:25:12.740]  I totally agree with you. Hey, is this your first time in Texas?
[1:25:12.740 --> 1:25:14.740]  No, I've been through Texas many times over my life.
[1:25:14.740 --> 1:25:16.740]  You ever had a top of Chico?
[1:25:16.740 --> 1:25:17.740]  I can't say I have.
[1:25:17.740 --> 1:25:20.740]  They are not a sponsor, but let me tell you, this is some super good mineral water.
[1:25:20.740 --> 1:25:21.740]  Okay.
[1:25:21.740 --> 1:25:24.740]  I'm addicted to this. People all be asking since they saw it on air what it is.
[1:25:24.740 --> 1:25:28.740]  I got to tell them, they're like, what kind of alcohol is that? There's no alcohol in this.
[1:25:28.740 --> 1:25:32.740]  I don't drink, ladies and gentlemen, on a stack of bibles. I'm a tea totaler.
[1:25:32.740 --> 1:25:36.740]  Everybody should have the freedom to live how they want to.
[1:25:36.740 --> 1:25:40.740]  You know, I ran into some folks, they said, you know, Alex, I think you're better when you're drunk on air.
[1:25:40.740 --> 1:25:45.740]  And I'm like, you know, when was that? So no, seriously, maybe on election night, we had a little bit of champagne,
[1:25:45.740 --> 1:25:48.740]  but back with Roger Stone when Trump won.
[1:25:48.740 --> 1:25:52.740]  But I could feel the disturbance of the force that when Trump won, all hell was about to break loose.
[1:25:52.740 --> 1:25:58.740]  Oh, right. I mean, at the time I was an over-Trumper and I went to sleep just like we all did.
[1:25:58.740 --> 1:26:04.740]  I was living in Colorado at the time, you know, went to sleep with the fully assuming that, you know,
[1:26:04.740 --> 1:26:06.740]  we'd have our first female president in the morning.
[1:26:06.740 --> 1:26:07.740]  I woke up in the middle.
[1:26:07.740 --> 1:26:08.740]  Madam president.
[1:26:08.740 --> 1:26:10.740]  I didn't. That's what everybody thought.
[1:26:10.740 --> 1:26:11.740]  Well, Newsweek said so.
[1:26:11.740 --> 1:26:14.740]  Everybody said so. You know, the polls said so.
[1:26:14.740 --> 1:26:23.740]  And what 90, what two 98% chance of her winning and I went to bed fairly certain that we would wake up with Madam president.
[1:26:23.740 --> 1:26:25.740]  I went to bed certain he was going to win.
[1:26:25.740 --> 1:26:27.740]  And lo and behold, you were right.
[1:26:27.740 --> 1:26:31.740]  Well, that's why Hillary was panicking so much as they have internal polls that are more accurate.
[1:26:31.740 --> 1:26:32.740]  Trump was way ahead.
[1:26:32.740 --> 1:26:35.740]  He won by a landslide as a lot of the lawsuits have shown.
[1:26:35.740 --> 1:26:37.740]  Millions voted illegally in California alone.
[1:26:37.740 --> 1:26:39.740]  A judicial watch has proven that now.
[1:26:39.740 --> 1:26:46.740]  And so Trump was a tsunami, but Hillary built this seawall of fraud, but the tsunami barely made it over the top.
[1:26:46.740 --> 1:26:52.740]  But I tell you, if Trump is arrogant or too confident about this next election, he's going to lose.
[1:26:52.740 --> 1:26:55.740]  Well, it's going to take everybody doing their part this time.
[1:26:55.740 --> 1:27:00.740]  I got to tell you, I think there's a good chance Trump's going to be removed and I'm not trying to add fuel.
[1:27:00.740 --> 1:27:02.740]  I'm not trying to encourage and give the enemies.
[1:27:02.740 --> 1:27:11.740]  I think it's all a legitimate aid and soaker, but the tea leaves are not good for Trump right now.
[1:27:11.740 --> 1:27:16.740]  And I think he's doing a great job with, you know, stand up to globalism, try to help the country and stuff.
[1:27:16.740 --> 1:27:23.740]  But I think if he can't get any deep state indicted for election meddling and all the fraud they've put out and all the insider trading and all the things they've done,
[1:27:23.740 --> 1:27:26.740]  if he can't do that, I think they're going to see that as a sign of weakness.
[1:27:26.740 --> 1:27:29.740]  And I think they're going to remove him one way or the other, including assassination.
[1:27:29.740 --> 1:27:33.740]  I mean, Lord knows, I hope it's not that way or anything.
[1:27:33.740 --> 1:27:39.740]  I mean, I'm a fan of if there's always any illegal activity, then everyone needs to be held accountable, regardless if we are.
[1:27:39.740 --> 1:27:53.740]  It is interesting to watch, especially my relatively short time on the inside at the bureau and just seeing the constant drive and spin and just guest after guest after guest.
[1:27:53.740 --> 1:27:56.740]  And they're normal lineup, you know, they're normal baseball.
[1:27:56.740 --> 1:27:58.740]  What would you call it? Total commitment?
[1:27:58.740 --> 1:28:01.740]  Everybody had the same the uniqueness of vision.
[1:28:01.740 --> 1:28:04.740]  You know, they all wanted the same thing and they were driving toward that.
[1:28:04.740 --> 1:28:06.740]  Is that cult like?
[1:28:06.740 --> 1:28:14.740]  I don't know if I'd go that far, but I just always want to say that all the people there were good people that that's what your video shows.
[1:28:14.740 --> 1:28:15.740]  Most of them are like, this is crazy.
[1:28:15.740 --> 1:28:18.740]  Yeah, they're all good people, talented people that just wanted to do their jobs.
[1:28:18.740 --> 1:28:21.740]  But we're, I like to say handcuffed from on high.
[1:28:21.740 --> 1:28:27.740]  You know, that's one of the many things I loved about the Veritas videos is they didn't make anyone else be a villain.
[1:28:27.740 --> 1:28:30.740]  That wasn't as such.
[1:28:30.740 --> 1:28:33.740]  And since you've been involved with Veritas, what's been like a year?
[1:28:33.740 --> 1:28:38.740]  Not even. We, James and I met at CPAC in February or March, whenever that.
[1:28:38.740 --> 1:28:40.740]  Oh, well, so Thomas, you know, well, six, seven months.
[1:28:40.740 --> 1:28:41.740]  Feels like a year.
[1:28:41.740 --> 1:28:42.740]  Yeah.
[1:28:42.740 --> 1:28:43.740]  We'll be right back.
[1:28:43.740 --> 1:28:47.740]  And by the way, I was going to do this the other day when you were on, but let's get Van Jones and the Nothing Burger.
[1:28:47.740 --> 1:28:48.740]  Because that impressed you, that impressed me.
[1:28:48.740 --> 1:28:50.740]  And then we're going to play some of the latest clubs.
[1:28:50.740 --> 1:28:52.740]  We're going to open the phones up to your calls.
[1:28:52.740 --> 1:28:53.740]  He's here.
[1:28:53.740 --> 1:28:54.740]  Cary Porch.
[1:28:54.740 --> 1:28:55.740]  Man has a lot of courage.
[1:28:55.740 --> 1:28:56.740]  We appreciate him.
[1:28:56.740 --> 1:28:57.740]  You're right back.
[1:28:57.740 --> 1:28:58.740]  I'm Alex Jones, newswars.com.
[1:28:58.740 --> 1:28:59.740]  Please don't share those links.
[1:28:59.740 --> 1:29:28.740]  Do what Oliver Darcy says and help shut down M4s.
[1:29:29.740 --> 1:29:35.740]  Go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[1:29:59.740 --> 1:30:18.740]  I work for my father, Lucifer, and he doesn't like the fact that God gave you all families
[1:30:18.740 --> 1:30:24.740]  and children and so we want to tell you something right now, Christian countries.
[1:30:24.740 --> 1:30:26.740]  We took control of you over 100 years ago.
[1:30:26.740 --> 1:30:32.740]  We've been spiking your water with fluoride and lower your fertility and it hurts you.
[1:30:32.740 --> 1:30:37.740]  And it's worked so well, but now because of liability and because of people warning inside
[1:30:37.740 --> 1:30:42.740]  the government what's happening, the Journal of American Medical Association and others
[1:30:42.740 --> 1:30:45.740]  are admitting what we've done and it makes me so angry.
[1:30:45.740 --> 1:30:52.740]  So whatever you do, just stay in that haze and drink fluoride and get it to your children.
[1:30:52.740 --> 1:30:57.740]  And don't visit infowarsstore.com and learn about the iodine conspiracy and get 60% off
[1:30:57.740 --> 1:31:02.740]  on X2 and X3 together with bio tricillinium from the mustard seed.
[1:31:02.740 --> 1:31:04.740]  Submit to us.
[1:31:04.740 --> 1:31:06.740]  Infowarsstore.com.
[1:31:06.740 --> 1:31:12.740]  Please listen to this information because it can save your life and it can save the life of others.
[1:31:12.740 --> 1:31:15.740]  There couldn't be more critical information for your physical body.
[1:31:15.740 --> 1:31:19.740]  God's more important when it comes to your soul, but this is most important when it comes to your body.
[1:31:19.740 --> 1:31:26.740]  If people didn't know that you put motor oil in a car's oil container to lube the engine,
[1:31:26.740 --> 1:31:32.740]  they might be able to be conned and think you put salt water in it, but it would seize up the engine pretty much instantly.
[1:31:32.740 --> 1:31:37.740]  Well, if they put fluoride in the human body, it causes cancer, dumps us down and destroys fertility.
[1:31:37.740 --> 1:31:44.740]  If you put the good halogen in the body, high quality iodine, it's like putting good high quality motor oil in the car
[1:31:44.740 --> 1:31:46.740]  that's supposed to run on it.
[1:31:46.740 --> 1:31:50.740]  For example, find out about the iodine conspiracy at infowarsstore.com
[1:31:50.740 --> 1:31:53.740]  and find out what the globalists hope that you do not research this information.
[1:31:53.740 --> 1:31:57.740]  Ladies and gentlemen, whatever you do, research iodine deficiency.
[1:31:57.740 --> 1:31:59.740]  It's the key to everything.
[1:31:59.740 --> 1:32:04.740]  And then go and take advantage of the 60% off combo with our two different types of high quality iodine
[1:32:04.740 --> 1:32:07.740]  and bio tricillinium at infowarsstore.com today.
[1:32:07.740 --> 1:32:10.740]  Infowars presents Alex Jones.
[1:32:10.740 --> 1:32:17.740]  In August of 2019, JAMA, or the Journal of the American Medical Association, the most prestigious came out and said,
[1:32:17.740 --> 1:32:24.740]  oh my gosh, just a little bit of fluoride in the water causes lowered IQs, massive infertility, and a lot of babies die in the womb,
[1:32:24.740 --> 1:32:28.740]  and it causes cancer. That was just one of thousands of studies admitting this.
[1:32:28.740 --> 1:32:33.740]  You know, it's illegal to have even one part per billion in the water in places like California,
[1:32:33.740 --> 1:32:39.740]  unless it's part of adding fluoride, and then they have a waiver and can add thousands of deadly chemicals to your water,
[1:32:39.740 --> 1:32:44.740]  because the liberals love you and they want to sexualize your children.
[1:32:44.740 --> 1:32:50.740]  So whatever you do, drink lots of fluoride and don't get the thing that counters iodine at infowarsstore.com.
[1:32:50.740 --> 1:32:56.740]  Drink fluoride and die. Drink fluoride, dirty Americans, and roll over.
[1:32:56.740 --> 1:32:59.740]  Do not visit infowarsstore.com and get high quality iodine to counter it.
[1:32:59.740 --> 1:33:09.740]  No, roll over and die, dirty Americans.
[1:33:09.740 --> 1:33:33.740]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:33:33.740 --> 1:33:40.740]  Gary Porch is our guest here. He's the big CNN whistleblower. He says, well, I was just low level. I was just there since 2017.
[1:33:40.740 --> 1:33:46.740]  Sometimes you can see from low level the biggest view, because you're seeing a lot of different slices of it.
[1:33:46.740 --> 1:33:53.740]  He's getting a daily call from Jeff Zucker. He's seeing what the average employees up to producers and camera people are saying.
[1:33:53.740 --> 1:33:58.740]  And I think you really had a bird's-eye view with the hundreds of hours of video you've got.
[1:33:58.740 --> 1:34:03.740]  It was certainly a fascinating point of bird's-eye view, as you say, because even the low level people,
[1:34:03.740 --> 1:34:09.740]  I tell the story like I wasn't some Navy SEAL operative trying to hack into the calls.
[1:34:09.740 --> 1:34:15.740]  They were there on speakerphone most every day. So I even noticed it the first week that I was there.
[1:34:15.740 --> 1:34:18.740]  I mean, I didn't know who it was. I just knew that it was someone high up.
[1:34:18.740 --> 1:34:26.740]  And that's kind of, within a couple months, that's what kind of made my antenna pop up and just start listening with a little more critical ear
[1:34:26.740 --> 1:34:28.740]  and started me down that path.
[1:34:28.740 --> 1:34:41.740]  Well, that's what's so frustrating for me is Hillary last week came out and the GOP War Room just got the number for the conference call of the DNC.
[1:34:41.740 --> 1:34:45.740]  And Hillary's on there saying, we've got to outlie the Republicans.
[1:34:45.740 --> 1:34:50.740]  Well, the Republicans, I don't see them really lying. I see Trump being very, very truthful. They try to spin everything he says
[1:34:50.740 --> 1:34:56.740]  and then do all these stunts with jars of gumballs or whatever. None of that's really true for my experience.
[1:34:56.740 --> 1:35:01.740]  And then they're the ones lying. I brought that up to you the other day, but you can really just get into these phone calls.
[1:35:01.740 --> 1:35:03.740]  You can find out this information.
[1:35:03.740 --> 1:35:08.740]  Yes. Again, I wasn't doing anything too difficult.
[1:35:08.740 --> 1:35:16.740]  I mean, just either hearing them myself or just sitting by a person with an open ear.
[1:35:16.740 --> 1:35:21.740]  I mean, it wasn't any trade secret. It was on speakerphone most days.
[1:35:21.740 --> 1:35:31.740]  Run through in a moment the laundry list because there's got to be 40, 50 videos that have been released now of what you think the gestalt is,
[1:35:31.740 --> 1:35:37.740]  what the takeaway is of why you were there, why you decided to go public and the aftermath of it.
[1:35:37.740 --> 1:35:40.740]  The story has reached hundreds of millions of people, no doubt around the world.
[1:35:40.740 --> 1:35:44.740]  It's been a huge story, but again, not in mainstream corporate media because they've been covering it up.
[1:35:44.740 --> 1:35:48.740]  But talk about Project Veritas. They didn't just bring down Acron.
[1:35:48.740 --> 1:35:52.740]  They didn't just expose big tech censorship. So many hundreds of big stories, hundreds of big ones.
[1:35:52.740 --> 1:35:59.740]  They got Van Jones, other CNN anchors and reporters to say, Russia Gate is a hoax.
[1:35:59.740 --> 1:36:03.740]  It's a nothing burger. There's nothing there. They know that just like Ukraine.
[1:36:03.740 --> 1:36:09.740]  It's two whistleblowers and now an ambassador who said they heard from somebody.
[1:36:09.740 --> 1:36:11.740]  Trump did quid pro quo.
[1:36:11.740 --> 1:36:14.740]  Well, still people on the call didn't happen.
[1:36:14.740 --> 1:36:23.740]  And the EU ambassador told the ambassador, the US ambassador, Bill Taylor told him and the guy had to testify to that over and over again.
[1:36:23.740 --> 1:36:27.740]  We are not doing quid pro quo. Whoever told you that's not true.
[1:36:27.740 --> 1:36:33.740]  And then they never say in the testimony I read it why they're not listening.
[1:36:33.740 --> 1:36:36.740]  Who told them that? Oh, that's a whistleblower again.
[1:36:36.740 --> 1:36:42.740]  So whoever initiates the lie, we can't ever hear from them, even though they've been proven to be liars.
[1:36:42.740 --> 1:36:44.740]  It was Obama persecuted whistleblowers in the press.
[1:36:44.740 --> 1:36:51.740]  Trump said none of it. When he says they're a liar, Chuck Schumer fires off a letter so scared saying this is persecution.
[1:36:51.740 --> 1:36:56.740]  Just even speaking badly of this godly person. What do you think of all that?
[1:36:56.740 --> 1:37:01.740]  I know that it's interesting now that I'm outside of the news industry.
[1:37:01.740 --> 1:37:05.740]  I really don't consume that much news anymore and I'm happier for the fact.
[1:37:05.740 --> 1:37:15.740]  I scroll Twitter here and there, but it's a lot easier to curate and target particular outlets that I want to watch from all over the spectrum.
[1:37:15.740 --> 1:37:20.740]  But even then when I noticed that, still to this day, they're still charging that Russia hill.
[1:37:20.740 --> 1:37:25.740]  They're still going for that even though it's Van Jones himself said it was nothing burger.
[1:37:25.740 --> 1:37:27.740]  Speaking of that, we'll play that clip next segment.
[1:37:27.740 --> 1:37:31.740]  Tulsi's come out and is just saying this is insane.
[1:37:31.740 --> 1:37:35.740]  I'm a veteran. I have no connection to Russia. How dare you?
[1:37:35.740 --> 1:37:43.740]  Those are fighting words and then CNN is defending it now and having analysts on that are saying, oh, Hillary's right to say this.
[1:37:43.740 --> 1:37:44.740]  She's probably a Russian.
[1:37:44.740 --> 1:37:47.740]  That whole thing still blows my mind.
[1:37:47.740 --> 1:37:53.740]  I literally thought that was satire when I saw that Hillary call Tulsi a Russian agent.
[1:37:53.740 --> 1:38:04.740]  Back when I was a Bernie supporter and stuff, I even then had respect for Tulsi because she resigned her vice chairship of the DNC to go publicly support him.
[1:38:04.740 --> 1:38:07.740]  She's always been on my radar and I can respect her for that.
[1:38:07.740 --> 1:38:09.740]  Oh, you can't doubt she's got integrity.
[1:38:09.740 --> 1:38:20.740]  Right. But to see now, at least from a low man's point of view, it just seems like a big retaliation thing again from the Hillary and her allies about Tulsi.
[1:38:20.740 --> 1:38:29.740]  I'm like, you know, because she, you know, essentially spat in the face of Hillary and her allies by stepping down and supporting Bernie and not falling in line back in 16.
[1:38:29.740 --> 1:38:36.740]  So I just, to me, I just find it very interesting to just see, for lack of a better word, the insanity unfold.
[1:38:36.740 --> 1:38:41.740]  I mean, when did satire become reality that is kind of the time I think we live in right now?
[1:38:41.740 --> 1:38:50.740]  Well, you keep calling yourself a low guy on the totem pole, the moral will and moral courage they found statistically is more rare than physical courage.
[1:38:50.740 --> 1:38:55.740]  And of course, a lot of times it turns into a physical issue of people don't have moral courage, then it becomes a physical fight.
[1:38:55.740 --> 1:38:56.740]  That's where tyrants always take it.
[1:38:56.740 --> 1:39:00.740]  But it's an old Texas Ranger founder saying, I'm probably going to butcher it because I don't have a teleprompter.
[1:39:00.740 --> 1:39:07.740]  But a man in the wrong can't stand up against a man in the right if he keeps on a comment.
[1:39:07.740 --> 1:39:14.740]  And in my experience, that's right. If you've got the moral right and you know you're right and you know you're not lying, you got a clear head.
[1:39:14.740 --> 1:39:18.740]  You're not delusional and you just keep on a comment. You end up winning.
[1:39:18.740 --> 1:39:24.740]  I mean, that's with anything in life. I mean, I'm 36 years old and I've definitely had some successes and failures thus far.
[1:39:24.740 --> 1:39:31.740]  But the common factor with anybody, they just keep going and eventually overcome any obstacles as long as they don't quit.
[1:39:31.740 --> 1:39:41.740]  Absolutely. Since we brought up Van Jones and one of the hundreds of incredible bombshells that Veritas investigators have gotten that we just forget.
[1:39:41.740 --> 1:39:46.740]  We've probably already forgotten what broke last week with our current guest, Van Jones. Russia is a nothing burger.
[1:39:46.740 --> 1:39:50.740]  That was two and a half years ago. Here it is.
[1:39:50.740 --> 1:39:52.740]  Hey, man.
[1:39:52.740 --> 1:39:57.740]  Hey, man.
[1:39:57.740 --> 1:39:59.740]  Hey, the Russia thing is just a big nothing burger.
[1:39:59.740 --> 1:40:01.740]  Really?
[1:40:01.740 --> 1:40:05.740]  The YCNN constantly, like, rush at this, rush at that.
[1:40:05.740 --> 1:40:07.740]  Because it's ratings.
[1:40:07.740 --> 1:40:13.740]  I would encourage everybody in this room and, frankly, everybody across the country to take a look at it.
[1:40:13.740 --> 1:40:15.740]  Changing it from fake news, though.
[1:40:15.740 --> 1:40:17.740]  Doesn't that under-vary fake news?
[1:40:17.740 --> 1:40:19.740]  I know, but aren't you...
[1:40:19.740 --> 1:40:22.740]  The Russia thing is just a big nothing burger.
[1:40:25.740 --> 1:40:29.740]  They've had polls come out. I don't go off these polls because we know they've sampled Democrats 15 points on average more,
[1:40:29.740 --> 1:40:37.740]  but even it showed a majority of Americans believe the Democrats criminally made up the whole Russia thing to try to remove Trump.
[1:40:37.740 --> 1:40:39.740]  I mean, they pretty much admitted that.
[1:40:39.740 --> 1:40:42.740]  Right, and they almost got them at that time.
[1:40:42.740 --> 1:40:50.740]  I mean, that was wall-to-wall news, especially, you know, Mother Report. I was boots on ground covering that at the DOJ in D.C.
[1:40:50.740 --> 1:40:52.740]  I mean, it was just a feeding frenzy.
[1:40:52.740 --> 1:40:59.740]  Again, I was new to this industry, but just watching it, seeing people from every outlet, every three-letter outlet,
[1:40:59.740 --> 1:41:07.740]  and it's like a school of piranhas over some fresh meat, and we were there for, you know, all day, every day for almost a week or so.
[1:41:07.740 --> 1:41:13.740]  I remember when I went with Roger Stone. I had the idea. I said, hey, I confronted the Twitter head and some other CEOs.
[1:41:13.740 --> 1:41:17.740]  I said, Sundar Pachai of Google is going to be there in about a week. We need to go.
[1:41:17.740 --> 1:41:21.740]  So they try to keep when they're going to be testifying secret now. They kind of show up the day of.
[1:41:21.740 --> 1:41:31.740]  And I go with Roger Stone, and the mainstream press didn't like me, but with Roger, they were just like, they were wolves.
[1:41:31.740 --> 1:41:39.740]  And they're like, you're going to get died. You're going to prison. And I was like, I mean, they were crazed.
[1:41:39.740 --> 1:41:42.740]  Like you said, piranhas. And they looked at me and go, you're going to go to prison, didn't you?
[1:41:42.740 --> 1:41:46.740]  And I was like, whoa, man, these people are nuts.
[1:41:46.740 --> 1:41:52.740]  Right. And keep in mind, you know, back then I was, you know, definitely a never Trump or never anything on the right.
[1:41:52.740 --> 1:42:04.740]  And even then I found it strange where magically people at my outlet just accidentally on purpose knew when and where to camp out their cameras for Roger Stone's arrest.
[1:42:04.740 --> 1:42:06.740]  I always found that suspect.
[1:42:06.740 --> 1:42:13.740]  And it turns out that the guy running our boom actually knows that fella that we've had run ins with him before.
[1:42:13.740 --> 1:42:18.740]  That guy's been here before they put him in here with vice when he came here.
[1:42:18.740 --> 1:42:26.740]  And it turns out he is a very close relationship with the leftist arm of the FBI and, you know, basically did the criminal beat with them.
[1:42:26.740 --> 1:42:32.740]  So the idea that he wasn't tipped off, we had the video from Roger's house where he's where he they're directing him.
[1:42:32.740 --> 1:42:42.740]  Well, yeah, I haven't seen that one yet, but it wouldn't surprise me because, you know, one thing I can say about my time here is that, you know, all these all the journalists were regardless of what outlet they're at.
[1:42:42.740 --> 1:42:44.740]  They're very driven. They're very motivated.
[1:42:44.740 --> 1:42:50.740]  And usually if there's one somewhere, there's a pack because they all work the same way they think the same way from what I've seen.
[1:42:50.740 --> 1:42:52.740]  And again, they're very motivated and good at their job.
[1:42:52.740 --> 1:42:58.740]  So just for there to be one outlet that five a.m. morning, I always found to be a little off.
[1:42:58.740 --> 1:43:04.740]  We've got the footage. It's from Roger's house. We'll be right back. Hell, we'll probably dig that up. Stay with us.
[1:43:04.740 --> 1:43:11.740]  Now, what I'm about to say is incredibly obvious and I'm not talking down to any of the viewers or any of the listeners.
[1:43:11.740 --> 1:43:17.740]  I'm just stating the facts. I own a chainsaw. I've had it since I was in college and it's a great good old chainsaw.
[1:43:17.740 --> 1:43:24.740]  And I've used it probably 500 times, but a few times I've forgotten to oil it and it seizes up really quick.
[1:43:24.740 --> 1:43:26.740]  And I feel like an idiot for not oiling it.
[1:43:26.740 --> 1:43:33.740]  Now, imagine if somebody told me to put, let's say superglue in the oil container on it, it would seize up forever.
[1:43:33.740 --> 1:43:35.740]  But only an evil person would do that.
[1:43:35.740 --> 1:43:39.740]  Well, fluorides like putting superglue in a chainsaw, it's going to make it seize up.
[1:43:39.740 --> 1:43:43.740]  And that's why they put it in the water and they admit they're doing it to hurt you and your family.
[1:43:43.740 --> 1:43:49.740]  Yes, they're really evil. Iodine is like putting oil in the chainsaw to help with the gasoline lubrication.
[1:43:49.740 --> 1:43:54.740]  It's that simple. I know you understand this, but let's warn other people before it's too late.
[1:43:54.740 --> 1:44:00.740]  It's part of the iodine conspiracy. Find out more at m4store.com and take action against the globalist.
[1:44:00.740 --> 1:44:05.740]  Carbon's everywhere on this planet. It's almost like we're carbon-based life forms.
[1:44:05.740 --> 1:44:09.740]  Welcome back to NPR here today. I'm Wilbur Snakely.
[1:44:09.740 --> 1:44:16.740]  And I just want you to know that when you hear the intro of the show and it's the Rockefeller Foundation and the Carnegie Foundation,
[1:44:16.740 --> 1:44:25.740]  don't look into the 1920s and 30s documents where they said that to be free from war we must end the family and masculinity
[1:44:25.740 --> 1:44:32.740]  and that we must put chemicals in the food and water to make the men subservient and the women infertile.
[1:44:32.740 --> 1:44:42.740]  A real terrorist, Alex Jones, has been on air with that gravely evil male voice telling you to look into how iodine's good for your body
[1:44:42.740 --> 1:44:48.740]  and essential and how fluoride's bad. Listen, that's a conspiracy theory, okay?
[1:44:48.740 --> 1:44:57.740]  There's no medical journals. There's no facts. You need fluoride. Just drink extra fluoride and then you don't have to think anymore
[1:44:57.740 --> 1:45:02.740]  and just go to sleep when I talk to you real soft like this.
[1:45:27.740 --> 1:45:30.740]  Well, that's right. Drink the fluoride.
[1:45:57.740 --> 1:46:05.740]  I'm speaking with a soft voice so I'm a liberal. Oh, and let Namble have access to your children.
[1:46:05.740 --> 1:46:13.740]  Again, I'm not talking down to the M4 Wars audience, but I've been banging my head against a wall for a long time on this
[1:46:13.740 --> 1:46:21.740]  and I'm talking about fluoride and I'm talking about iodine. Now, if you have a boat, a motorboat, let's say an old glass-tron boat
[1:46:21.740 --> 1:46:27.740]  and you want to take it on the lake, you've got to have a lake to put it in.
[1:46:27.740 --> 1:46:32.740]  If you're a human being, you've got to have oxygen to live. Okay, it's the same thing.
[1:46:32.740 --> 1:46:38.740]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, the bad halogen is fluoride. That's why in every western nation they put it in the water.
[1:46:38.740 --> 1:46:42.740]  They're going to teach us Christians to lay down and die. The chai comms don't put it in the water.
[1:46:42.740 --> 1:46:48.740]  They'd execute you if you did that. They put iodine in the water because it's the good halogen and increases fertility
[1:46:48.740 --> 1:46:55.740]  and lifespan and intelligence and everything else. So again, learn about the iodine conspiracy at infowarstore.com.
[1:46:55.740 --> 1:47:01.740]  We have all the documents and articles linked. And then get good iodine for yourself because the globalists are fighting to make sure you don't.
[1:47:01.740 --> 1:47:19.740]  Again, get iodine at infowarstore.com.
[1:47:31.740 --> 1:47:50.740]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Alex Jozier, host on this live Wednesday edition.
[1:47:50.740 --> 1:47:54.740]  Kerry Port, senior whistleblowers here with us. I'm going to get the number out at the end of this segment.
[1:47:54.740 --> 1:47:59.740]  I'll take calls next hour. Constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes is going to be coming in as well in studio.
[1:47:59.740 --> 1:48:05.740]  But I'm not trying to talk about myself here, but I've been put on trial as an example of how we should get rid of the First Amendment.
[1:48:05.740 --> 1:48:11.740]  But here's an article. It's linked to the group saying that they're putting microchips in the homeless here in Austin.
[1:48:11.740 --> 1:48:19.740]  The same group's done it in Latin America. And then I have stacks of all these tech heads saying we're going to put chips in your children's brains starting next year.
[1:48:19.740 --> 1:48:27.740]  And then I chose the company doing it, putting it under the skin. I mean, yes, this sounded crazy when I was telling people 20 years ago about it,
[1:48:27.740 --> 1:48:35.740]  but it was in white papers. And here's one right now. This is an article up on infowarstore.com and newswarstore.com by Ben Warren.
[1:48:35.740 --> 1:48:40.740]  It needs to get out there. Hackers can exploit smart lights to spy on you.
[1:48:40.740 --> 1:49:03.740]  Study says from UT San Antonio professor who heads up the Privacy Trust in Ethics and Computing Research Lab. And they're telling you that the approved lights that Obama and the UN globally standardized are designed where you can use internet over power lines
[1:49:03.740 --> 1:49:11.740]  or data over power lines to go into them. And then they flicker and then control switches that are now on board computers.
[1:49:11.740 --> 1:49:19.740]  Even when you don't have an infrared sensor on it and aren't using that, they've put little tiny infrared chips in them that even the little light holes.
[1:49:19.740 --> 1:49:31.740]  Engineers explained this to me many years ago go through and then the computer has a little whistle machine that whistles in subaudible tones and then communicates with the other devices in your house.
[1:49:31.740 --> 1:49:37.740]  And I was told this by high level engineers 20 years ago. Then I saw it here and there in news later. I know that sounds crazy.
[1:49:37.740 --> 1:49:43.740]  Like animal human hybrids I told you about 20 years ago now over the news. And they admit, oh, it was going on 40 years ago.
[1:49:43.740 --> 1:49:52.740]  Well, I told you 20 years ago it was going on 20 years before. Exactly what I told you. So I get it that all this sounds crazy and weird and nuts.
[1:49:52.740 --> 1:50:01.740]  And here they are demonizing me. Alex Jones says Jeff Bezos and the CIA are spying on Trump with light bulbs.
[1:50:01.740 --> 1:50:10.740]  And I told the White House, I sent them letters through law firms and Trump read it and I said you need as a security risk to get those type of light bulbs out.
[1:50:10.740 --> 1:50:20.740]  And of course it turned out there are all these weird antennas put up by governments, the Israelis, other US agencies that just so happened to be able to dial into those light bulbs.
[1:50:20.740 --> 1:50:27.740]  So University of Texas at San Antonio saying it. I know it sounds crazy, but that's just an example.
[1:50:27.740 --> 1:50:37.740]  I mean, I'd have to look at all the studies myself, but I wouldn't put it that far past. I mean, we see the tapes that I did with nothing but a button cam.
[1:50:37.740 --> 1:50:45.740]  And that's just a very crude piece of equipment. I mean, the stuff that we can do, I mean, we all know our phones are tracking and listening and doing all this stuff.
[1:50:45.740 --> 1:50:50.740]  Everybody swears they're not listening, but then you pop up on Facebook and what you were saying last night with cat food.
[1:50:50.740 --> 1:50:52.740]  Now you have an ad for cat food type things.
[1:50:52.740 --> 1:50:58.740]  And now they admit it though. I mean, here's an example. It's come out that almost all smart TVs communicate with Facebook.
[1:50:58.740 --> 1:50:59.740]  I saw that. Yeah.
[1:50:59.740 --> 1:51:05.740]  Even if you're not even ever gone to Facebook, it's selling your data that Netflix is giving all your data to Facebook.
[1:51:05.740 --> 1:51:11.740]  Right. Well, Netflix has been going down the tube for the last few years anyway. So I'm trying to find a different platform.
[1:51:11.740 --> 1:51:17.740]  You know how R2D2 talks? He goes, they were making that move back in the 70s.
[1:51:17.740 --> 1:51:22.740]  They went to engineers and they said, how would robots communicate? They say with bleeps and whistles.
[1:51:22.740 --> 1:51:27.740]  Remember Captain Crunch, the famous hacker that could whistle into a phone and take control of the phone company?
[1:51:27.740 --> 1:51:28.740]  I think I remember hearing.
[1:51:28.740 --> 1:51:29.740]  Yeah, yeah, that's how it works.
[1:51:29.740 --> 1:51:33.740]  So someone say, guys, just type in the secret world of devices.
[1:51:33.740 --> 1:51:40.740]  Devices in your home are secretly communicating using subaudible tones.
[1:51:40.740 --> 1:51:46.740]  And that's how radio works. That's how radio stations, it knows when a break is, there's a subaudible tone firing.
[1:51:46.740 --> 1:51:48.740]  So I just have engineers around why I know about it.
[1:51:48.740 --> 1:51:52.740]  But see, I tell people that 20 years ago, they thought I was crazy.
[1:51:52.740 --> 1:51:56.740]  I mean, it's, it's not far-fetched. I mean, didn't that forgive my ignorance?
[1:51:56.740 --> 1:52:01.740]  I'm not a complete engineer, but isn't that how just phones work like a different tone for each number?
[1:52:01.740 --> 1:52:02.740]  And it tells it how to dial, right?
[1:52:02.740 --> 1:52:03.740]  That was the old system.
[1:52:03.740 --> 1:52:11.740]  Exactly. So you could get into the central switchboards, like you've ever seen the phone repair man?
[1:52:11.740 --> 1:52:14.740]  How they have that big special phone that can dial in and does different tones and things?
[1:52:14.740 --> 1:52:15.740]  I think so.
[1:52:15.740 --> 1:52:17.740]  Well, a human voice can learn those and do that themselves.
[1:52:17.740 --> 1:52:18.740]  So that's the old technology.
[1:52:18.740 --> 1:52:19.740]  Well, there it is.
[1:52:19.740 --> 1:52:22.740]  Early hackers use whistles from Captain Crunch's cereal boxes.
[1:52:22.740 --> 1:52:24.740]  That's why they call them Captain Crunch.
[1:52:24.740 --> 1:52:25.740]  Wow.
[1:52:25.740 --> 1:52:28.740]  But, but guys, it came out a month ago.
[1:52:28.740 --> 1:52:33.740]  If you type in home devices are communicating with each other with tones.
[1:52:33.740 --> 1:52:36.740]  And if the Alexa devices, it's the Google homes.
[1:52:36.740 --> 1:52:40.740]  It's all those systems are using tones.
[1:52:40.740 --> 1:52:43.740]  So they're communicating with each other and then reporting on you.
[1:52:43.740 --> 1:52:48.740]  And then if you're a person they're looking for, when you come in, they recognize your voice with voice print.
[1:52:48.740 --> 1:52:49.740]  That goes down the line.
[1:52:49.740 --> 1:52:51.740]  It's checked by a mainframe, an AI.
[1:52:51.740 --> 1:52:56.740]  And then millisecond later, it then reports where your location is off your voice print,
[1:52:56.740 --> 1:52:59.740]  even if you aren't using a phone.
[1:52:59.740 --> 1:53:01.740]  That's kind of terrifying.
[1:53:01.740 --> 1:53:04.740]  And that was like in Wired Magazine a month ago.
[1:53:04.740 --> 1:53:09.740]  I was just told this by engineers that were famous engineers.
[1:53:09.740 --> 1:53:11.740]  I mean, these guys were, you know, rich engineers.
[1:53:11.740 --> 1:53:14.740]  They were explaining, no, Alex, the machines are communicating, all of them are doing it.
[1:53:14.740 --> 1:53:16.740]  The internet's being built to do this.
[1:53:16.740 --> 1:53:22.740]  The whole thing was built from the beginning to totally surveil everybody and to have this whole machine interface takeover.
[1:53:22.740 --> 1:53:24.740]  I'm just trying to compute all that information.
[1:53:24.740 --> 1:53:33.740]  Like it's even a little bit that I know is terrifying to me of how we're tracked and, you know, kind of matrix style where all our data is compiled and sold.
[1:53:33.740 --> 1:53:41.740]  And, you know, you look at your Instagram or whatever feeds and those ads are pretty scary because they seem to know me extremely well.
[1:53:41.740 --> 1:53:44.740]  Like, yes, I do want to buy this t-shirt or whatever it is.
[1:53:44.740 --> 1:53:46.740]  And again, you didn't even talk to it on the internet.
[1:53:46.740 --> 1:53:47.740]  It's listening.
[1:53:47.740 --> 1:53:52.740]  Word files are created off of the audio that's being reported.
[1:53:52.740 --> 1:53:54.740]  It gets compressed into packets.
[1:53:54.740 --> 1:53:58.740]  When the phone communicates back, it sends the information back to the tower.
[1:53:58.740 --> 1:54:00.740]  Or when it's plugged in, it sends it back to the internet.
[1:54:00.740 --> 1:54:07.740]  And then that data is sold and batched normally within hours, and then you get the ad back on your system.
[1:54:07.740 --> 1:54:09.740]  Well, they definitely know what they're doing because, yeah.
[1:54:09.740 --> 1:54:10.740]  Well, let me prove it.
[1:54:10.740 --> 1:54:16.740]  We first reported it in 2014 in InfoWars because Google put out a prospectus to its shareholders that they were already doing it.
[1:54:16.740 --> 1:54:20.740]  And that they'd gone from beta test to operational 2014.
[1:54:20.740 --> 1:54:22.740]  No, no, no, 2004.
[1:54:22.740 --> 1:54:23.740]  Excuse me.
[1:54:23.740 --> 1:54:31.740]  Then in 2005, Samsung, in its terms of service with smart TVs, told people,
[1:54:31.740 --> 1:54:36.740]  we're listening to you as selling the audio files to third parties.
[1:54:36.740 --> 1:54:38.740]  Without your consent, right?
[1:54:38.740 --> 1:54:40.740]  Well, it says you opt in.
[1:54:40.740 --> 1:54:41.740]  Fantastic consent.
[1:54:41.740 --> 1:54:42.740]  Yeah, because there's a 30-page-something deal.
[1:54:42.740 --> 1:54:43.740]  You don't even read it.
[1:54:43.740 --> 1:54:44.740]  You click it.
[1:54:44.740 --> 1:54:45.740]  Right.
[1:54:45.740 --> 1:54:46.740]  Just like your iTunes, right?
[1:54:46.740 --> 1:54:47.740]  Yeah, but it was, I'm not trying to preach at you.
[1:54:47.740 --> 1:54:52.740]  I just wanted to bring all this up, and I promise you, because, you know, the crew's so good at finding headlines.
[1:54:52.740 --> 1:54:53.740]  Sometimes they can't.
[1:54:53.740 --> 1:54:54.740]  I don't give them the exact headline.
[1:54:54.740 --> 1:54:56.740]  I'm going to get you before you leave.
[1:54:56.740 --> 1:55:03.740]  A couple mainstream headlines where they admit that machines are communicating with each other with the tones inside your house,
[1:55:03.740 --> 1:55:06.740]  even when they're not connected to the Internet sometimes.
[1:55:06.740 --> 1:55:07.740]  So it's a big deal.
[1:55:07.740 --> 1:55:10.740]  It's fully believable, especially with 5G coming out and everything like that.
[1:55:10.740 --> 1:55:11.740]  Well, we're going to get it.
[1:55:11.740 --> 1:55:13.740]  We'll have it by next hour, if everybody.
[1:55:13.740 --> 1:55:16.740]  Now, I didn't get to these clips I wanted to play, but I want to open the phones up for you.
[1:55:16.740 --> 1:55:19.740]  So I'm not just ranting here, but you are a soft-spoken gentleman.
[1:55:19.740 --> 1:55:20.740]  So look out.
[1:55:20.740 --> 1:55:21.740]  I'll just be ranting.
[1:55:21.740 --> 1:55:22.740]  At times.
[1:55:22.740 --> 1:55:23.740]  I bet you can get wound up.
[1:55:23.740 --> 1:55:25.740]  Well, let's get pissed in.
[1:55:25.740 --> 1:55:26.740]  Mr. Parks.
[1:55:26.740 --> 1:55:27.740]  Damn it.
[1:55:27.740 --> 1:55:28.740]  You just blew CNN wide open.
[1:55:28.740 --> 1:55:29.740]  I'm joking.
[1:55:29.740 --> 1:55:32.740]  You know, that's related to your 70 Sam.
[1:55:32.740 --> 1:55:36.740]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-8789-2539.
[1:55:36.740 --> 1:55:37.740]  And here's the deal, callers.
[1:55:37.740 --> 1:55:38.740]  I don't screen your calls.
[1:55:38.740 --> 1:55:39.740]  Usually it's a free-for-all.
[1:55:39.740 --> 1:55:46.740]  Because if I have a guest sometime, it's for them about whistleblowers, about CNN, about
[1:55:46.740 --> 1:55:50.740]  what he saw inside CNN, about what video clip you think's most important as he's been persecuted,
[1:55:50.740 --> 1:55:51.740]  has CNN responded.
[1:55:51.740 --> 1:55:52.740]  Those are the type of questions.
[1:55:52.740 --> 1:55:58.740]  I'd love to hear your questions or comments for our guest, Kerry Porch, big-time CNN whistleblower,
[1:55:58.740 --> 1:56:02.740]  but just absolutely the most devastating leak ever of the type of deception and manipulation
[1:56:02.740 --> 1:56:13.740]  and false advertisements going on, 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539, 877-789-Alex, specifically for
[1:56:13.740 --> 1:56:15.740]  questions or comments for our guest.
[1:56:15.740 --> 1:56:23.740]  But first, let's go to this clip here of Hillary really getting excited when one of her little
[1:56:23.740 --> 1:56:27.740]  planted people in the audience has turned out almost all of her events she's having are
[1:56:27.740 --> 1:56:30.740]  getting her ready to relaunch officially her campaign.
[1:56:30.740 --> 1:56:34.740]  Here she is cackling like the wicked witch at the east when the person says they want
[1:56:34.740 --> 1:56:35.740]  her to run for president.
[1:56:35.740 --> 1:56:38.740]  All that matters is that we win.
[1:56:38.740 --> 1:56:44.740]  I hate to be so simplistic about it.
[1:56:44.740 --> 1:56:54.740]  We have to nominate the best person.
[1:56:54.740 --> 1:56:55.740]  Well, thank you.
[1:56:55.740 --> 1:56:56.740]  Thank you.
[1:56:56.740 --> 1:57:01.740]  Oh, and in case anybody's leaving us this hour, I just remember the exact headline from
[1:57:01.740 --> 1:57:03.740]  Imple Wars that has the articles linked in it.
[1:57:03.740 --> 1:57:05.740]  That's the secret life of machines.
[1:57:05.740 --> 1:57:09.740]  Learn how machines are secretly communicating with each other inside of your house.
[1:57:09.740 --> 1:57:12.740]  We will have all of that because I'm going to get on a computer and I'm going to pull
[1:57:12.740 --> 1:57:16.740]  it up and I'm going to show it to you because I want you to know that this is all out of
[1:57:16.740 --> 1:57:18.740]  the open and they think you're stupid.
[1:57:18.740 --> 1:57:19.740]  They think you're dumb.
[1:57:19.740 --> 1:57:22.740]  They're just going to roll out brain chips for your kids at the mall.
[1:57:22.740 --> 1:57:26.740]  Well, Susie got one so I want one and I told you that a decade ago that they would do it
[1:57:26.740 --> 1:57:30.740]  that way and now they're doing it like it's not even like a medical procedure.
[1:57:30.740 --> 1:57:31.740]  It's no big deal.
[1:57:31.740 --> 1:57:32.740]  It's super easy.
[1:57:32.740 --> 1:57:38.740]  But I do want all hands on deck because my OCD has kicked in really bad on this and I've
[1:57:38.740 --> 1:57:40.740]  just got to have those.
[1:57:40.740 --> 1:57:41.740]  Hell, I did video reports.
[1:57:41.740 --> 1:57:42.740]  I did special reports.
[1:57:42.740 --> 1:57:46.740]  I mean, I had stacks of those things just a month ago here in the studio.
[1:57:46.740 --> 1:57:50.740]  Hell, we may just dig up the special report and air it now because the truth is this is
[1:57:50.740 --> 1:57:52.740]  key information we're going to play for you.
[1:57:52.740 --> 1:57:57.740]  Don't worry.
[1:57:57.740 --> 1:57:59.740]  Here are the facts.
[1:57:59.740 --> 1:58:06.740]  Iodine raises IQ and across the board makes you more healthy in thousands of top studies
[1:58:06.740 --> 1:58:09.740]  including the American Medical Journal.
[1:58:09.740 --> 1:58:15.740]  Every type of fluoride lowers IQ, massively increases cancer and destroys fertility.
[1:58:15.740 --> 1:58:16.740]  That's the facts.
[1:58:16.740 --> 1:58:21.740]  Learn about the iodine conspiracy and then once you've learned about it, protect yourself
[1:58:21.740 --> 1:58:22.740]  and your family.
[1:58:22.740 --> 1:58:27.740]  The reason I'm so hot on this is the globalists put the fluoride in the water while making
[1:58:27.740 --> 1:58:28.740]  sure we don't get the iodine.
[1:58:28.740 --> 1:58:32.740]  In China, they put the iodine in the water and ban the fluoride because they've already
[1:58:32.740 --> 1:58:34.740]  got their people under their control.
[1:58:34.740 --> 1:58:36.740]  The globalists are targeting us here.
[1:58:36.740 --> 1:58:38.740]  Please go to infowarestore.com.
[1:58:38.740 --> 1:58:43.740]  Experience iodine and bio-trustilinium that goes with it together and then once you see
[1:58:43.740 --> 1:58:45.740]  the great results, warn others.
[1:58:45.740 --> 1:58:47.740]  This is the Achilles Hill of the globalist.
[1:58:47.740 --> 1:58:48.740]  It's a win-win situation.
[1:58:48.740 --> 1:58:50.740]  The only way you lose is not taking action.
[1:58:50.740 --> 1:58:56.740]  Take action now.
[1:58:56.740 --> 1:58:58.740]  It is now an admitted fact.
[1:58:58.740 --> 1:59:03.740]  Fluoride out of the water has caused tens of millions of Americans to be brain damaged
[1:59:03.740 --> 1:59:06.740]  and to have infertility and low IQs.
[1:59:06.740 --> 1:59:10.740]  And it doesn't matter if the Journal of American Medical Association comes out and says it's
[1:59:10.740 --> 1:59:14.740]  terrible, still the city's put it in the water because the ruling globalists want you and
[1:59:14.740 --> 1:59:16.740]  your family poisoned and stupid.
[1:59:16.740 --> 1:59:22.740]  And they sure don't want you to know about the good allergen iodine that absolutely increases
[1:59:22.740 --> 1:59:27.740]  IQ and fertility and makes life so wonderful and opens up your consciousness, your mind,
[1:59:27.740 --> 1:59:28.740]  everything.
[1:59:28.740 --> 1:59:29.740]  Thank God.
[1:59:29.740 --> 1:59:30.740]  Thank God.
[1:59:30.740 --> 1:59:32.740]  I discovered this eight years ago.
[1:59:32.740 --> 1:59:35.740]  Of course, the enemy knows all about it and they hope you don't discover it.
[1:59:35.740 --> 1:59:37.740]  They hope you just roll over and die.
[1:59:37.740 --> 1:59:39.740]  So whatever you do, don't visit infowarestore.com.
[1:59:39.740 --> 1:59:44.740]  It gets 60% off right now on the wake up the world to the iodine conspiracy combo.
[1:59:44.740 --> 1:59:48.740]  60% off with X2 and X3 together with your bottle of Biotrusillinium.
[1:59:48.740 --> 1:59:50.740]  Whatever you do, don't go to infowarestore.com.
[1:59:50.740 --> 1:59:51.740]  Just give up America.
[1:59:51.740 --> 1:59:52.740]  Give up Christians.
[1:59:52.740 --> 1:59:54.740]  Drink your fluoride and die.
[1:59:54.740 --> 1:59:55.740]  Give into Satan.
[1:59:55.740 --> 2:00:16.740]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show leading a frontal assault on the lives of the new
[2:00:16.740 --> 2:00:17.740]  world order.
[2:00:17.740 --> 2:00:18.740]  It's Alex Jones.
[2:00:18.740 --> 2:00:25.740]  All right, I kind of go down these rabbit trails when I say something absolutely fantastic
[2:00:25.740 --> 2:00:27.740]  like light bulbs can spy on you in your house.
[2:00:27.740 --> 2:00:28.740]  The high tech light bulbs.
[2:00:28.740 --> 2:00:30.740]  And then I'm trying to find the articles about it.
[2:00:30.740 --> 2:00:31.740]  But here it is.
[2:00:31.740 --> 2:00:35.740]  Alex Jones says Jeff Bezos and CIA are spying on Trump with light bulbs.
[2:00:35.740 --> 2:00:37.740]  This is one article from last year of the rap.
[2:00:37.740 --> 2:00:41.740]  And I was telling Trump, listen, they can use laser couplers on your window.
[2:00:41.740 --> 2:00:47.740]  That's 40 year old declassified technology, probably 50 cell phones.
[2:00:47.740 --> 2:00:48.740]  Everybody knows cell phones spy on you.
[2:00:48.740 --> 2:00:50.740]  We first broke that 20 plus years ago.
[2:00:50.740 --> 2:00:51.740]  And light bulbs.
[2:00:51.740 --> 2:00:58.740]  Well, University of Texas has come out and warned folks that indeed that's going on.
[2:00:58.740 --> 2:01:02.740]  And so has Forbes and the Guardian and a bunch of others.
[2:01:02.740 --> 2:01:06.740]  The crew did a great job pulling all of these articles up.
[2:01:06.740 --> 2:01:09.740]  Hackers can exploit smart lights to spy on you.
[2:01:09.740 --> 2:01:10.740]  Study finds.
[2:01:10.740 --> 2:01:14.740]  And it's not just the chips that are in the light that is programmed.
[2:01:14.740 --> 2:01:21.740]  The light itself can interface with your computer that has switches built into it that these
[2:01:21.740 --> 2:01:22.740]  things can access.
[2:01:22.740 --> 2:01:24.740]  This is all the Trojan horse system.
[2:01:24.740 --> 2:01:28.740]  Some chips have a capacitor in it that's a transceiver.
[2:01:28.740 --> 2:01:33.740]  Also, where even if you don't ever wire something to the internet, like a cell phone, they can
[2:01:33.740 --> 2:01:38.740]  have devices that are closer to it, like your smart meter or a smart hub or any of these
[2:01:38.740 --> 2:01:39.740]  things.
[2:01:39.740 --> 2:01:46.740]  It can energize with a transmission the chip and then it blurps back the compressed encoded
[2:01:46.740 --> 2:01:47.740]  data.
[2:01:47.740 --> 2:01:50.740]  And so that was some of what was in those articles.
[2:01:50.740 --> 2:01:54.740]  And then the crew did actually find the article.
[2:01:54.740 --> 2:01:55.740]  Here it is.
[2:01:55.740 --> 2:01:56.740]  This has links to it.
[2:01:56.740 --> 2:01:57.740]  I'm going to shut up.
[2:01:57.740 --> 2:02:01.740]  This is Kit Daniel, September 24th.
[2:02:01.740 --> 2:02:07.740]  Breaking TVs and smartphones talking in secret to spy on you using subaudible and above
[2:02:07.740 --> 2:02:09.740]  audible like dog whistle communications.
[2:02:09.740 --> 2:02:11.740]  That's digital trends reported.
[2:02:11.740 --> 2:02:14.740]  And then it goes into the links to all of that right there for you.
[2:02:14.740 --> 2:02:16.740]  So I'm just I'm not making this up.
[2:02:16.740 --> 2:02:18.740]  I swear on a stack of Bibles.
[2:02:18.740 --> 2:02:19.740]  I'm sorry.
[2:02:19.740 --> 2:02:20.740]  You're our guest here and I'm ranting.
[2:02:20.740 --> 2:02:21.740]  No, no, no.
[2:02:21.740 --> 2:02:22.740]  It's quite all right.
[2:02:22.740 --> 2:02:23.740]  Alex.
[2:02:23.740 --> 2:02:24.740]  I just love sitting here listening.
[2:02:24.740 --> 2:02:25.740]  It's a lot of fun.
[2:02:25.740 --> 2:02:28.740]  Well, I want to take some phone calls and I want to get into some of these clips.
[2:02:28.740 --> 2:02:31.740]  And I want to talk about Tulsi Gabbard's as well being called a Russian agent my Hillary
[2:02:31.740 --> 2:02:38.740]  next segment, but in this short segment talking to you on air last on Skype and then seeing
[2:02:38.740 --> 2:02:43.740]  you on Owen show that I talked to you some you really seem empowered and happy.
[2:02:43.740 --> 2:02:46.740]  Were you this happy before or are you really more happy now?
[2:02:46.740 --> 2:02:52.740]  Oh, I was absolutely mortified and depressed and confused leading up to the release.
[2:02:52.740 --> 2:02:57.740]  Just a wave of emotions like a sine wave from top of the mountain feeling like I know I'm
[2:02:57.740 --> 2:03:02.740]  doing the right thing for the Republic and then a minute later, you know, Colin James
[2:03:02.740 --> 2:03:06.740]  O'Keefe and some of my friends just like crying on the floor like what am I doing?
[2:03:06.740 --> 2:03:07.740]  Like this is going to destroy me.
[2:03:07.740 --> 2:03:11.740]  You know, like it's just up and down the very, very quick.
[2:03:11.740 --> 2:03:14.740]  But remember Eric Cochran, the Pinterest guy, right?
[2:03:14.740 --> 2:03:15.740]  The Pinterest insider.
[2:03:15.740 --> 2:03:16.740]  Yes.
[2:03:16.740 --> 2:03:19.740]  He said something very profound to me leading up to the release.
[2:03:19.740 --> 2:03:23.740]  He's like, Kara, I know you're going to catch some heat and I felt the same way, but I promise
[2:03:23.740 --> 2:03:31.740]  you within three hours of the release, you will feel perfect and he was it was true.
[2:03:31.740 --> 2:03:32.740]  Exactly.
[2:03:32.740 --> 2:03:34.740]  It felt bad up until you made the plunge.
[2:03:34.740 --> 2:03:35.740]  Yep.
[2:03:35.740 --> 2:03:37.740]  And then once you hit the water, it felt good.
[2:03:37.740 --> 2:03:43.740]  Well, I mean, it was a big it was a big blur because again, we were doing a lot of moving
[2:03:43.740 --> 2:03:45.740]  parts leading up to the release.
[2:03:45.740 --> 2:03:49.740]  We knew when it was coming out and, you know, we're having to move out at the same time,
[2:03:49.740 --> 2:03:54.740]  stage everything, grab the U-Haul, coordinate all these different pieces to where, you know,
[2:03:54.740 --> 2:03:56.740]  once it went live, we were gone.
[2:03:56.740 --> 2:04:01.740]  You know, we weren't really too scared for a physical safety, although it was in our
[2:04:01.740 --> 2:04:04.740]  minds, but we just wanted to be out of DC when it released.
[2:04:04.740 --> 2:04:06.740]  Oh my gosh, I should have asked this question.
[2:04:06.740 --> 2:04:08.740]  Guys, queue up Mission Impossible if you can.
[2:04:08.740 --> 2:04:12.740]  When you come back, you got to start over because you were there that morning.
[2:04:12.740 --> 2:04:13.740]  Yes.
[2:04:13.740 --> 2:04:18.740]  Whenever the head of CNN is on the phone in the conference call saying, well, we'll talk
[2:04:18.740 --> 2:04:19.740]  about we come back.
[2:04:19.740 --> 2:04:20.740]  Sure.
[2:04:20.740 --> 2:04:21.740]  Because that's just amazing.
[2:04:21.740 --> 2:04:25.740]  And then what it was like getting out of there as they were about to figure out it was you.
[2:04:25.740 --> 2:04:28.740]  Yeah, it was it was wild.
[2:04:28.740 --> 2:04:29.740]  That's kick ass, man.
[2:04:29.740 --> 2:04:33.740]  I bet your wife, I bet your wife's even more proud of you know, future wife.
[2:04:33.740 --> 2:04:36.740]  But yeah, she's my rock and and and everything.
[2:04:36.740 --> 2:04:39.740]  I mean, she was she was on board your fiance.
[2:04:39.740 --> 2:04:40.740]  Plus enough.
[2:04:40.740 --> 2:04:41.740]  See fake news.
[2:04:41.740 --> 2:04:43.740]  You heard her folks fake news.
[2:04:43.740 --> 2:04:45.740]  He's he caught me.
[2:04:45.740 --> 2:04:47.740]  Snopes will have an article out by tonight.
[2:04:47.740 --> 2:04:49.740]  Yeah, you're nothing but fake news, Alex, right?
[2:04:49.740 --> 2:04:51.740]  I mean, you know, I wish I was fake news.
[2:04:51.740 --> 2:04:52.740]  I wish this stuff wasn't true.
[2:04:52.740 --> 2:04:55.740]  I mean, I wish I could take the blue pill again and working there.
[2:04:55.740 --> 2:04:59.740]  I mean, I wish I could go back to being a happy liberal and everything like that.
[2:04:59.740 --> 2:05:00.740]  Well, let's talk about it.
[2:05:00.740 --> 2:05:02.740]  We're back in 60 seconds.
[2:05:02.740 --> 2:05:17.740]  Welcome back to MPR here today.
[2:05:17.740 --> 2:05:18.740]  I'm Wilbur Snakely.
[2:05:18.740 --> 2:05:22.740]  And I just want you to know that when you hear the intro of the show and it's the
[2:05:22.740 --> 2:05:28.740]  Rockefeller Foundation and the Carnegie Foundation, don't look into the 1920s and 30s documents where
[2:05:28.740 --> 2:05:33.740]  men subservient and the women infertile, a real terrorist.
[2:05:33.740 --> 2:05:39.740]  Alex Jones has been on air with that gravely evil male voice telling you to look into
[2:05:39.740 --> 2:05:44.740]  how iodine is good for your body and essential and how fluoride is bad.
[2:05:44.740 --> 2:05:46.740]  Listen, that's a conspiracy theory.
[2:05:46.740 --> 2:05:48.740]  OK, there's no medical journals.
[2:05:48.740 --> 2:05:49.740]  There's no facts.
[2:05:49.740 --> 2:05:51.740]  You need fluoride.
[2:05:51.740 --> 2:05:57.740]  Just drink extra fluoride and then you don't have to think anymore and just go to sleep.
[2:05:57.740 --> 2:06:00.740]  When I talk to you real soft like this.
[2:06:28.740 --> 2:06:35.740]  OK, I don't want to turn this into an obsession about light bulbs spying on you, but the University
[2:06:35.740 --> 2:06:43.740]  of Texas Internet Security and Privacy Lab has come out and warned that smart light bulbs
[2:06:43.740 --> 2:06:46.740]  are spying on you and that hackers can get through on them.
[2:06:46.740 --> 2:06:47.740]  Well, of course it was.
[2:06:47.740 --> 2:06:51.740]  So I was saying hackers can break into your nest or whatever.
[2:06:51.740 --> 2:06:53.740]  It's designed for the companies to do it.
[2:06:53.740 --> 2:06:55.740]  They're the ones doing it.
[2:06:55.740 --> 2:07:01.740]  Science Daily study warns of security gaps in smart light bulbs.
[2:07:01.740 --> 2:07:03.740]  University of Texas at San Antonio.
[2:07:03.740 --> 2:07:05.740]  There is the study.
[2:07:05.740 --> 2:07:08.740]  Now I can show you mainstream news attacking me.
[2:07:08.740 --> 2:07:10.740]  Kind of like Forbes did this year.
[2:07:10.740 --> 2:07:14.740]  Jones claims fluoride lowers IQ causes cancer infertility.
[2:07:14.740 --> 2:07:18.740]  Journal of American Medicine came out and said exactly that because it's already known.
[2:07:18.740 --> 2:07:22.740]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to stop ranting about all of that.
[2:07:22.740 --> 2:07:24.740]  I just want you to know we're not making this up.
[2:07:24.740 --> 2:07:28.740]  I understand it's scary, but I'm telling you this stuff because I believe in you,
[2:07:28.740 --> 2:07:32.740]  and I believe by exposing it, we can say no, but it's always the most disenfranchised,
[2:07:32.740 --> 2:07:36.740]  the weakest parts of the public that are enslaved first.
[2:07:36.740 --> 2:07:40.740]  That's why when the government started shipping in narcotics, it was the black neighborhood
[2:07:40.740 --> 2:07:42.740]  because, oh, well, they could cover that up.
[2:07:42.740 --> 2:07:45.740]  When they tested syphilis on people, it was the black folks.
[2:07:45.740 --> 2:07:47.740]  Then they expanded it out to other groups.
[2:07:47.740 --> 2:07:51.740]  Well, now the homeless in Austin are getting microchips.
[2:07:51.740 --> 2:07:53.740]  That story's up on infowars.com.
[2:07:53.740 --> 2:07:58.740]  We just kind of move on from there because, hell, what's going to top Elon Musk on four months ago
[2:07:58.740 --> 2:08:04.740]  saying, by 2020, we're going to have at the mall where your kid goes and gets wires put in their brain.
[2:08:04.740 --> 2:08:07.740]  It's no big deal. It's like getting your tooth worked on.
[2:08:07.740 --> 2:08:11.740]  Kerry Porch is here. He's going to take phone calls.
[2:08:11.740 --> 2:08:16.740]  Robert Barnes, constitutional lawyer, is going to be in here with us as well that he's going to host the fourth hour.
[2:08:16.740 --> 2:08:20.740]  He's a smart cookie, and I got a lot of stuff I want to talk about with him.
[2:08:20.740 --> 2:08:24.740]  The whole fake Ukraine situation, this latest person that says they heard it third hand.
[2:08:24.740 --> 2:08:26.740]  Again, oh, it's so bombshell.
[2:08:26.740 --> 2:08:33.740]  But, Kerry, you started telling the story right before the break about what it was like being at CNN
[2:08:33.740 --> 2:08:39.740]  and when the Veritas stuff broke last week on Monday and what it was like
[2:08:39.740 --> 2:08:43.740]  and the whole mission impossible of then why you decided to do that,
[2:08:43.740 --> 2:08:47.740]  how you caught that last phone call by the CEO, Jeff Zucker,
[2:08:47.740 --> 2:08:49.740]  and then what it was like getting out of the building.
[2:08:49.740 --> 2:08:54.740]  I was a whirlwind to say the least and at the time it didn't feel like it,
[2:08:54.740 --> 2:09:00.740]  but looking back on it, it really kind of was mission impossible to say the least
[2:09:00.740 --> 2:09:05.740]  because we got, you know, obviously we knew when it was dropping that day that Monday
[2:09:05.740 --> 2:09:09.740]  and I went into work and wanted to get on the call
[2:09:09.740 --> 2:09:14.740]  and hopefully Zucker was going to get some type of reaction and he did as we saw that teaser tweet
[2:09:14.740 --> 2:09:22.740]  and I think it was around 11.30 or so, 11.45 and, you know, it went live a little bit before we wanted it to.
[2:09:22.740 --> 2:09:26.740]  So in my mind, I was already burned so that's when I kind of pulled grip,
[2:09:26.740 --> 2:09:29.740]  caught up and wheels up and got out of there.
[2:09:29.740 --> 2:09:34.740]  Veritas guys were nice enough to help us move everything into the U-Haul and leave town right as we were.
[2:09:34.740 --> 2:09:35.740]  Wow.
[2:09:35.740 --> 2:09:40.740]  Right, so and the crazy part is my future wife and I, we were pretty much dark.
[2:09:40.740 --> 2:09:44.740]  We turned our phones off, the crew with us, they had their phones
[2:09:44.740 --> 2:09:46.740]  because they wanted to kind of follow the action and stuff,
[2:09:46.740 --> 2:09:51.740]  but we were pretty much dark for like the first two or three hours after it
[2:09:51.740 --> 2:09:55.740]  and while it was making its way across the world,
[2:09:55.740 --> 2:10:02.740]  our crew didn't see the actual part one video until two or three hours later in a,
[2:10:02.740 --> 2:10:07.740]  in a dingy U-Haul van in Maryland somewhere just after we got done moving
[2:10:07.740 --> 2:10:10.740]  and we just kind of just sat in the back of a van.
[2:10:10.740 --> 2:10:12.740]  The lot of us, I'm not going to say how many,
[2:10:12.740 --> 2:10:17.740]  but we finally got to watch the tape together and it was pretty cool to see it out there
[2:10:17.740 --> 2:10:21.740]  with like the hundreds of thousands at the time retweets and whatnot.
[2:10:21.740 --> 2:10:26.740]  And then now millions of people watched it and how fast moving it is that hundreds of hours of video,
[2:10:26.740 --> 2:10:29.740]  they get it, you don't even know the exact last product
[2:10:29.740 --> 2:10:34.740]  and then you're in a van literally in the getaway mobile while you're watching what you just did.
[2:10:34.740 --> 2:10:38.740]  Well, it was after the fact we finished moving stuff to a different location
[2:10:38.740 --> 2:10:42.740]  and it was just wild that the crew of us that were all part of this operation
[2:10:42.740 --> 2:10:46.740]  because I mean your viewers and especially the guys at CNN, nobody's done,
[2:10:46.740 --> 2:10:49.740]  they know that now they know that I wasn't the only one there.
[2:10:49.740 --> 2:10:53.740]  So there was other people there and our crew,
[2:10:53.740 --> 2:10:59.740]  yeah, we just sat in the back of an old-ass U-Haul van and just watched it on an iPad and it was kind of cruel.
[2:10:59.740 --> 2:11:05.740]  Go back, some stations don't care that first five minutes and you were talking about another whistleblower
[2:11:05.740 --> 2:11:10.740]  that encouraged you and empowered you and that it was scary up until you had finally happened
[2:11:10.740 --> 2:11:13.740]  and then how invigorating it was because I want to encourage other people
[2:11:13.740 --> 2:11:17.740]  that I'm telling you, there's nothing more valuable than doing the right thing.
[2:11:17.740 --> 2:11:21.740]  Absolutely, Alex. And it was Eric Cochran who was the Pinterest insider
[2:11:21.740 --> 2:11:26.740]  and leading up to this, he and I and the other whistleblowers had spoke from time to time
[2:11:26.740 --> 2:11:32.740]  and he said something very profound where, you know, just where he wanted to encourage me
[2:11:32.740 --> 2:11:36.740]  because I was being very emotional, high, emotional and low leading up to the release
[2:11:36.740 --> 2:11:38.740]  and he just said something so profound and he was like,
[2:11:38.740 --> 2:11:42.740]  Kerry, I promise you within three to five hours of when we upload,
[2:11:42.740 --> 2:11:46.740]  you will feel peace and vindication and know that you do the right thing
[2:11:46.740 --> 2:11:48.740]  and that's exactly what happened.
[2:11:48.740 --> 2:11:52.740]  Well, Joe Rogan was scared to have me on the second time, it was the biggest podcast he ever did
[2:11:52.740 --> 2:11:56.740]  and after the podcast, even during, he's like, man, I should do this more often.
[2:11:56.740 --> 2:11:58.740]  I was all worried about this and this was awesome.
[2:11:58.740 --> 2:12:01.740]  We said one of our longest podcasts ever and he totally loves it
[2:12:01.740 --> 2:12:03.740]  and now he had Snowden on.
[2:12:03.740 --> 2:12:04.740]  I got to watch that one.
[2:12:04.740 --> 2:12:08.740]  So see, and it's invigorating because just to have, you know,
[2:12:08.740 --> 2:12:12.740]  some boring New York Times reporter on that doesn't even know what the word toady means,
[2:12:12.740 --> 2:12:17.740]  she's like, Tulsi Gabbard is a toady and Joe goes, well, why is she a toady?
[2:12:17.740 --> 2:12:18.740]  What's a toady?
[2:12:18.740 --> 2:12:20.740]  And then she goes, what is a toady?
[2:12:20.740 --> 2:12:22.740]  With Barry Weiss, right?
[2:12:22.740 --> 2:12:24.740]  Yeah, that was really scary.
[2:12:24.740 --> 2:12:25.740]  I watched that.
[2:12:25.740 --> 2:12:26.740]  I watched that cringe.
[2:12:26.740 --> 2:12:30.740]  I'm like, this, again, this is a venerated, you know, New York Times,
[2:12:30.740 --> 2:12:32.740]  pinnacle of journalism, blue check journalist.
[2:12:32.740 --> 2:12:34.740]  And then Joe wasn't trying to dissect her.
[2:12:34.740 --> 2:12:35.740]  He was just asking.
[2:12:35.740 --> 2:12:37.740]  She was so one dimensional.
[2:12:37.740 --> 2:12:38.740]  He was okay.
[2:12:38.740 --> 2:12:39.740]  Well, then what's this word means?
[2:12:39.740 --> 2:12:40.740]  He was, I don't know.
[2:12:40.740 --> 2:12:41.740]  She didn't know anything.
[2:12:41.740 --> 2:12:47.740]  I mean, a 10th grade English student would know more than that woman.
[2:12:47.740 --> 2:12:49.740]  But again, that's what they're hiring him for.
[2:12:49.740 --> 2:12:50.740]  They are so stupid.
[2:12:50.740 --> 2:12:52.740]  And it's like you said, it's a hive mentality.
[2:12:52.740 --> 2:12:55.740]  They give him the talking points, they go vomit them back up.
[2:12:55.740 --> 2:12:56.740]  Right.
[2:12:56.740 --> 2:12:58.740]  And I'm sure you saw Joe's petition or not Joe's petition,
[2:12:58.740 --> 2:13:01.740]  but that one circling to get him moderated DNC debate.
[2:13:01.740 --> 2:13:03.740]  Like I still think that's a great idea.
[2:13:03.740 --> 2:13:05.740]  But there's such control freaks, but I don't even want him to do that
[2:13:05.740 --> 2:13:08.740]  because it ended up having 50 million viewers and 72 million.
[2:13:08.740 --> 2:13:09.740]  Right.
[2:13:09.740 --> 2:13:10.740]  Exactly.
[2:13:10.740 --> 2:13:12.740]  They're total failures, but they're so scared of giving Joe Rogan power.
[2:13:12.740 --> 2:13:13.740]  He already has power.
[2:13:13.740 --> 2:13:15.740]  Like M4s has power because it's independent.
[2:13:15.740 --> 2:13:17.740]  But again, there's such control freaks.
[2:13:17.740 --> 2:13:21.740]  They're holding on to this collapsing facade, this edifice.
[2:13:21.740 --> 2:13:22.740]  Well, yeah.
[2:13:22.740 --> 2:13:23.740]  And even a would just get YouTube.
[2:13:23.740 --> 2:13:26.740]  You know, she's got a down, downgrade people like you and,
[2:13:26.740 --> 2:13:29.740]  and you know, your crowders, your Jimmy doors, everyone like that,
[2:13:29.740 --> 2:13:32.740]  but try to prop up the authoritative news sources like your foxes,
[2:13:32.740 --> 2:13:33.740]  CNNs, MSNBC.
[2:13:33.740 --> 2:13:35.740]  And they admit they force feed those.
[2:13:35.740 --> 2:13:36.740]  Oh yeah.
[2:13:36.740 --> 2:13:37.740]  And that was another whistleblower, wasn't it?
[2:13:37.740 --> 2:13:39.740]  An inside video from one of the YouTube's conferences.
[2:13:39.740 --> 2:13:40.740]  Right.
[2:13:40.740 --> 2:13:41.740]  Hey, this is what we're doing going up and then going down.
[2:13:41.740 --> 2:13:44.740]  And I was like, oh, it's just like business as usual.
[2:13:44.740 --> 2:13:45.740]  And then they go on the news and tonight's happening.
[2:13:45.740 --> 2:13:47.740]  Well, I mean, I got to say news core is really bad news.
[2:13:47.740 --> 2:13:48.740]  And they're good people.
[2:13:48.740 --> 2:13:49.740]  They're like Tucker Carlson and others.
[2:13:49.740 --> 2:13:53.740]  By the way, let me just tell you, it was announced all over the national news
[2:13:53.740 --> 2:13:56.740]  that Tucker Carlson was in a secret meeting with Zuckerberg.
[2:13:56.740 --> 2:13:59.740]  Well, it's no secret that I'm friends with Tucker Carlson.
[2:13:59.740 --> 2:14:00.740]  Have dinner with him.
[2:14:00.740 --> 2:14:01.740]  Sometimes he's been here.
[2:14:01.740 --> 2:14:04.740]  I talked to the horse's mouth.
[2:14:04.740 --> 2:14:05.740]  He thinks it's hilarious.
[2:14:05.740 --> 2:14:09.740]  Tucker Carlson did not have any meeting with Jeff Zuckerberg.
[2:14:09.740 --> 2:14:12.740]  It's not true.
[2:14:12.740 --> 2:14:16.740]  Jeff Zucker, the head of Facebook, is a...
[2:14:16.740 --> 2:14:18.740]  Zucker, just regular Zuckerberg.
[2:14:18.740 --> 2:14:19.740]  Zuckerberg.
[2:14:19.740 --> 2:14:20.740]  Mark Zuckerberg.
[2:14:20.740 --> 2:14:22.740]  I'm getting all the Zuck and Zuckerbergs.
[2:14:22.740 --> 2:14:23.740]  Plus enough.
[2:14:23.740 --> 2:14:24.740]  There's no teleprompter here.
[2:14:24.740 --> 2:14:28.740]  As you notice, I do make mistakes where it names flipped.
[2:14:28.740 --> 2:14:32.740]  No, it's very fascinating to be here because, you know, seeing you and the gang on TV
[2:14:32.740 --> 2:14:34.740]  and to be on this type of set, it's fascinating to see.
[2:14:34.740 --> 2:14:38.740]  It seems a lot more, you know, a lot more free flowing and live and stuff
[2:14:38.740 --> 2:14:39.740]  and not very scripted.
[2:14:39.740 --> 2:14:40.740]  It's not.
[2:14:40.740 --> 2:14:43.740]  In fact, for three segments, I've been wanting to play this clip.
[2:14:43.740 --> 2:14:44.740]  It's not their fault.
[2:14:44.740 --> 2:14:45.740]  We haven't played it yet.
[2:14:45.740 --> 2:14:47.740]  When we come back, we'll play it and then go to phone calls.
[2:14:47.740 --> 2:14:51.740]  And that is Congressman Quigley.
[2:14:51.740 --> 2:14:55.740]  This is the guy openly in hearings says he wants me taken off the air.
[2:14:55.740 --> 2:15:04.740]  And then he gives false reasons why he said that we put out fake news that a man yelled,
[2:15:04.740 --> 2:15:10.740]  Allah is great, God is great when he drove the truck over people and got out with a gun in New York.
[2:15:10.740 --> 2:15:12.740]  Well, that was a jihadi.
[2:15:12.740 --> 2:15:15.740]  He did yell that.
[2:15:15.740 --> 2:15:20.740]  And but Quigley has Twitter and Facebook and YouTube minions in front of him.
[2:15:20.740 --> 2:15:22.740]  They're like, sir, we took it down at lunch.
[2:15:22.740 --> 2:15:24.740]  We saw it was the top story on Twitter.
[2:15:24.740 --> 2:15:26.740]  We apologize when we come back.
[2:15:26.740 --> 2:15:33.740]  I'm going to play this clip where he's going after Tulsi Gabbards and agreeing with Hillary that, oh, we need to really worry.
[2:15:33.740 --> 2:15:37.740]  About this evil Russian.
[2:15:37.740 --> 2:15:39.740]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:15:39.740 --> 2:15:43.740]  Well, imagine if you're actually Russian, there's a lot of Russians of America, veterans, you name it.
[2:15:43.740 --> 2:15:47.740]  Imagine what it's like for them to constantly hear about Russians being so evil.
[2:15:47.740 --> 2:15:49.740]  But that's all part of this discrimination.
[2:15:49.740 --> 2:15:51.740]  People don't believe all this racism garbage anymore.
[2:15:51.740 --> 2:15:56.740]  So all they do is they just carry pick and they say somebody's a Russian agent.
[2:15:56.740 --> 2:15:57.740]  That's the new thing.
[2:15:57.740 --> 2:15:58.740]  Well, they're right back.
[2:15:58.740 --> 2:16:00.740]  And one of your friends, Scott Goldsmith, has called in.
[2:16:00.740 --> 2:16:01.740]  We're going to get him on.
[2:16:01.740 --> 2:16:03.740]  Can't wait.
[2:16:03.740 --> 2:16:08.740]  One of the most frequently asked questions we get in customer service is, what is the real red pill?
[2:16:08.740 --> 2:16:10.740]  And what is the real red pill plus?
[2:16:10.740 --> 2:16:16.740]  Well, real red pill is a vitamin, mineral, multivitamin, high quality with preglinone.
[2:16:16.740 --> 2:16:22.740]  Real red pill plus is the same thing with a little bit of clean added energy on top of it as well.
[2:16:22.740 --> 2:16:24.740]  That kicks in in 30 minutes.
[2:16:24.740 --> 2:16:28.740]  But the preglinone kicks in in about a week or so.
[2:16:28.740 --> 2:16:31.740]  Folks, look into preglinone for yourself.
[2:16:31.740 --> 2:16:35.740]  Look into high end sources of it like real red pill and real red pill plus.
[2:16:35.740 --> 2:16:41.740]  And then you'll definitely want to try it out and see the effects you get within about seven days to two weeks generally.
[2:16:41.740 --> 2:16:43.740]  But believe me, it's a missing link.
[2:16:43.740 --> 2:16:45.740]  You need to find out about it.
[2:16:45.740 --> 2:16:47.740]  As we age, preglinone levels go down.
[2:16:47.740 --> 2:16:51.740]  All of our hormones in our body are manufactured by the body using preglinone.
[2:16:51.740 --> 2:16:57.740]  You need to learn about preglinone and then you need to get the real red pill or the real red pill plus.
[2:16:57.740 --> 2:17:02.740]  Now, 50% off at InfoWarsLife.com, the real red pill plus.

[2:18:06.740 --> 2:18:10.740]  God's more important when it comes to your soul, but this is most important when it comes to your body.
[2:18:10.740 --> 2:18:17.740]  If people didn't know that you put motor oil in a car's oil container to lube the engine,
[2:18:17.740 --> 2:18:21.740]  they might be able to be conned and think you put salt water in it.
[2:18:21.740 --> 2:18:27.740]  But it would seize up the engine pretty much instantly.
[2:18:27.740 --> 2:18:32.740]  Well, if they put fluoride in the human body, it causes cancer, dumbs us down and destroys fertility.
[2:18:32.740 --> 2:18:40.740]  If you put the good halogen in the body, high quality iodine, it's like putting good high quality motor oil in the car that's supposed to run on it.
[2:18:40.740 --> 2:18:41.740]  It's that simple.
[2:18:41.740 --> 2:18:47.740]  Find out about the iodine conspiracy at InfoWarsLife.com and find out what the globalists hope that you do not research this information.
[2:18:47.740 --> 2:18:51.740]  Ladies and gentlemen, whatever you do, research iodine deficiency.
[2:18:51.740 --> 2:18:53.740]  It's the key to everything.
[2:18:53.740 --> 2:19:01.740]  And then go and take advantage of the 60% off combo with our two different types of high quality iodine and bio tricillinium at InfoWarsStore.com today.
[2:19:01.740 --> 2:19:05.740]  InfoWars presents Alex Jones.
[2:19:05.740 --> 2:19:11.740]  In August of 2019, JAMA, or the Journal of the American Medical Association, the most prestigious came out and said,
[2:19:11.740 --> 2:19:18.740]  oh my gosh, just a little bit of fluoride in the water causes lowered IQs, massive infertility, and a lot of babies dying in the womb.
[2:19:18.740 --> 2:19:19.740]  And it causes cancer.
[2:19:19.740 --> 2:19:22.740]  That was just one of thousands of studies admitting this.
[2:19:22.740 --> 2:19:29.740]  You know, it's illegal to have even one part per billion in the water in places like California unless it's part of adding fluoride.
[2:19:29.740 --> 2:19:36.740]  And then they have a waiver and can add thousands of deadly chemicals to your water because the liberals love you.
[2:19:36.740 --> 2:19:41.740]  And they want to sexualize your children.
[2:19:41.740 --> 2:19:47.740]  So whatever you do, drink lots of fluoride and don't get the thing that counters iodine at InfoWarsStore.com.
[2:19:47.740 --> 2:19:50.740]  Drink fluoride and die.
[2:19:50.740 --> 2:19:53.740]  Drink fluoride, dirty Americans, and roll over.
[2:19:53.740 --> 2:19:57.740]  Do not visit InfoWarsStore.com and get high poly iodine to counter it.
[2:19:57.740 --> 2:20:07.740]  No, roll over and die, dirty Americans.
[2:20:07.740 --> 2:20:22.740]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:20:22.740 --> 2:20:28.740]  His name's Cary Porch, and he gave us his bio. It's pretty limited, but I'll say, man, what's your background?
[2:20:28.740 --> 2:20:29.740]  You're a great guy.
[2:20:29.740 --> 2:20:32.740]  And then he was talking about his buddy, Scott Goldschmidt, that was texting me and wanted to be on the show.
[2:20:32.740 --> 2:20:36.740]  We called him up, got a bunch of callers here, and he said, yeah, but I knew him and I rock.
[2:20:36.740 --> 2:20:40.740]  Well, and then Cary was in the military in the Navy.
[2:20:40.740 --> 2:20:44.740]  So now folks want to know about you because you didn't tell us all this.
[2:20:44.740 --> 2:20:49.740]  What is your background? CNN, huge whistleblower, biggest Veritas bombshell yet?
[2:20:49.740 --> 2:20:57.740]  I have a very wide background, you know, like put myself through college or at least try to do the first time, you know, waiting tables, everything like that.
[2:20:57.740 --> 2:20:59.740]  At the time I was a music major.
[2:20:59.740 --> 2:21:04.740]  Now I'm actually a mathematics and like an physiology type sports major.
[2:21:04.740 --> 2:21:06.740]  But yeah, they went into the military.
[2:21:06.740 --> 2:21:10.740]  I did about a little over 10 years combined with active and reserve time.
[2:21:10.740 --> 2:21:16.740]  I went to Iraq, was mobilized to Afghanistan, you know, didn't quite get to make it past the med check.
[2:21:16.740 --> 2:21:17.740]  What'd you do in the Navy in Iraq?
[2:21:17.740 --> 2:21:24.740]  So I was what's called the Navy CVs, which is the construction engineering, like the Civil Engineering Corps, like, you know, pulling wires, setting...
[2:21:24.740 --> 2:21:25.740]  It's like the Army Corps engineers.
[2:21:25.740 --> 2:21:28.740]  Exactly, the exact same thing just for the Navy.
[2:21:28.740 --> 2:21:37.740]  And, you know, my particular job, I was an electrician and, you know, we built the power grids abroad and taught the local populations how to safely use electricity.
[2:21:37.740 --> 2:21:39.740]  You know, that was kind of our job.
[2:21:39.740 --> 2:21:41.740]  I loved every part of what I did abroad.
[2:21:41.740 --> 2:21:47.740]  And then when I got back stateside on the reserve side, I did the funeral honors, you know, like folding the flag for the...
[2:21:47.740 --> 2:21:52.740]  Folding the flag given to the surviving spouses, you know, everything like that and playing taps.
[2:21:52.740 --> 2:21:53.740]  And that was kind of my...
[2:21:53.740 --> 2:21:56.740]  Oh, wow, before you leave, so now you got to go today.
[2:21:56.740 --> 2:22:04.740]  I really want to play that little short video of Trump when he talks about how terrible it is when, you know, when the dead troops come home and what the families go through.
[2:22:04.740 --> 2:22:07.740]  So guys, find that for the last segment of this hour, please.
[2:22:07.740 --> 2:22:13.740]  I think it's called Trump Tear Jerker and we put video to it, which Obama, you know, banned showing the cops coming back.
[2:22:13.740 --> 2:22:16.740]  Trump opened it up to honor these people.
[2:22:16.740 --> 2:22:23.740]  But Facebook banned it as hateful material when Darren McGreen posted it.
[2:22:23.740 --> 2:22:28.740]  So they banned Trump saying it's time to end the wars and talk about how great our veterans are.
[2:22:28.740 --> 2:22:30.740]  I mean, that whole thing is crazy.
[2:22:30.740 --> 2:22:36.740]  I mean, most of people that I know that I was actually in Iraq with or even other veterans from other services.
[2:22:36.740 --> 2:22:37.740]  I mean, everyone's different.
[2:22:37.740 --> 2:22:42.740]  Of course, you're free to believe what you want to, but, you know, nobody wants to be in endless wars.
[2:22:42.740 --> 2:22:45.740]  You know, not only the veterans themselves, but the people here.
[2:22:45.740 --> 2:22:47.740]  How would you describe yourself?
[2:22:47.740 --> 2:22:52.740]  And I'm going to go to the calls and Robert Barnes is coming in too, but there's so much because you called yourself a liberal.
[2:22:52.740 --> 2:22:53.740]  And I don't call that a leftist.
[2:22:53.740 --> 2:22:55.740]  I mean, liberals are classical Americans, in my view.
[2:22:55.740 --> 2:22:59.740]  What was your view before you were on the inside of the beast at CNN?
[2:22:59.740 --> 2:23:01.740]  And then what would you call yourself now?
[2:23:01.740 --> 2:23:16.740]  So, yes, and, you know, I use the term loosely with liberal and everything, but, you know, I supported Bernie in the 2016 election voted for him caucus forum in the primaries and then voted for Gary Johnson in the in the general just because I didn't like Hillary and I didn't like Trump.
[2:23:16.740 --> 2:23:22.740]  So I just went third party and nobody said my vote mattered until obviously the next day.
[2:23:22.740 --> 2:23:37.740]  But I would actually say I was more in the term of leftist or far left when I got to CNN. And then from what I saw the two and a half year journey, I basically basically got to red pill myself on YouTube while I was in the bureau.
[2:23:37.740 --> 2:23:45.740]  And I would say I mostly center right libertarian kind of right now but definitely leaning more and more conservative with each passing day.
[2:23:45.740 --> 2:23:53.740]  You know, I spoke at a turning point event in College Station last night, a bunch of great kids there, great people.
[2:23:53.740 --> 2:23:57.740]  And it was a lot of fun to meet a lot of people that, you know, just wanted to know what happened.
[2:23:57.740 --> 2:24:02.740]  Well, you'll get a big scarlet letter put on you if you do this, but that's really a badge of honor.
[2:24:02.740 --> 2:24:08.740]  But I'd like to talk about doing some projects with you or offering you a job here because we need new reporters.
[2:24:08.740 --> 2:24:15.740]  We need folks that could run a couple of reporters and you seem like a smart, competent guy. You're a likable guy in person. And we don't have a big budget around here.
[2:24:15.740 --> 2:24:19.740]  But I'd really like to try to get you to do some work with us because we helped launch Trump.
[2:24:19.740 --> 2:24:21.740]  He'll launch the whole Americana deal.
[2:24:21.740 --> 2:24:27.740]  And a lot of the Republican insiders try to keep people away from info wars because, you know, the left media had taxes.
[2:24:27.740 --> 2:24:33.740]  People should really embrace that to counter the leftist propaganda instead of kind of giving in to letting them be the gatekeepers.
[2:24:33.740 --> 2:24:38.740]  But regardless of what you do, I'm excited about having you on the outside of CNN.
[2:24:38.740 --> 2:24:44.740]  Yeah. And again, my lady and I were entertaining everything that's coming our way.
[2:24:44.740 --> 2:24:47.740]  We're not ruling out anything. I'm sure you can appreciate it.
[2:24:47.740 --> 2:24:51.740]  Oh, I love it. Well, before you go today, I'm going to do a shoot right after the show.
[2:24:51.740 --> 2:24:57.740]  But we should talk on the phone about ideas you've got because I'm trying to hire a few more reporters, a few more people, especially for 2020,
[2:24:57.740 --> 2:25:01.740]  to really go out there and fight. And you can see here, this is totally transparent.
[2:25:01.740 --> 2:25:07.740]  I'm just here covering news and clips and then we go out and interview people and show what's going on, contrary to what they claim we do.
[2:25:07.740 --> 2:25:12.740]  This is great. I mean, I didn't know what to expect when I came here and I like what I see.
[2:25:12.740 --> 2:25:17.740]  Well, what we need to do more of is Project Veritas stuff in the field as well.
[2:25:17.740 --> 2:25:21.740]  And I wish there were more groups like Veritas. And I know that James O'Keefe does as well.
[2:25:21.740 --> 2:25:25.740]  It's kind of scary that that's the only group that is as successful as he is.
[2:25:25.740 --> 2:25:32.740]  Well, that's just a testament to James and his team. Like he is very, very particular with who he hires and vets and everything.
[2:25:32.740 --> 2:25:37.740]  Like he and I talked for almost two months, you know, while he and his team were vetting me quietly,
[2:25:37.740 --> 2:25:40.740]  making sure that I wasn't a CNN plant trying to inside.
[2:25:40.740 --> 2:25:43.740]  And boy, have they not tried to destroy him and put him in prison.
[2:25:43.740 --> 2:25:44.740]  I mean, they've sued him.
[2:25:44.740 --> 2:25:46.740]  They say he puts out fake video. No, it's not.
[2:25:46.740 --> 2:25:54.740]  It's tape. I mean, even when I was a leftist, I didn't like James, but I respected him because he had the tape.
[2:25:54.740 --> 2:25:57.740]  I was like, oh, OK, it's, you know, acorn and this and that.
[2:25:57.740 --> 2:26:02.740]  I'm like, well, it's, you know, my people at the time, but I'm like, you can't argue with tape, you know.
[2:26:02.740 --> 2:26:05.740]  So I always respected him and it's always kind of crazy.
[2:26:05.740 --> 2:26:07.740]  Never thought I'd end up working with him one day.
[2:26:07.740 --> 2:26:10.740]  And now I get to call him a friend. Like how crazy is this life?
[2:26:10.740 --> 2:26:18.740]  Well, that's the great part about being a patriot is you get to meet all these great people and then black, white, old, young, male, female.
[2:26:18.740 --> 2:26:26.740]  And then when you go and you meet the leftist and they're like skexies from the dark crystal and just just totally evil and lie.
[2:26:26.740 --> 2:26:30.740]  Let's lie. Yes. And you're like, whoa, who the hell are these people?
[2:26:30.740 --> 2:26:37.740]  I mean, before I torched my Facebook the morning of obviously, but you know how they do the memories thing like, hey, do you remember this five years ago?
[2:26:37.740 --> 2:26:43.740]  And it was me doing like some, you know, crazy far left ideology post and whatnot like that.
[2:26:43.740 --> 2:26:45.740]  I'm like, oh, it's a total cringe fest.
[2:26:45.740 --> 2:26:50.740]  I'm like, was it a process or a moment when you got out of the cult process?
[2:26:50.740 --> 2:26:59.740]  It was this process of work coming to work in DC and kind of seeing how the sausage is made slowly, but surely, you know, watching an ecosystem of videos here and there.
[2:26:59.740 --> 2:27:09.740]  And just being open enough to start to actually entertain other ideas, you know, without accepting them at that time, but just being open enough to OK, let's see what the other side has to say.
[2:27:09.740 --> 2:27:17.740]  And there was a whole ecosystem on YouTube where I could go from one video to the next. I know they're going to take this out of context and see the YouTube radicalizes people.
[2:27:17.740 --> 2:27:27.740]  You remember that New York Times article, but it just got me a point where I could start watching pieces of several different people's videos and was slowly but surely kind of red peeling me in the process.
[2:27:27.740 --> 2:27:29.740]  It's because you saw the manipulation.
[2:27:29.740 --> 2:27:31.740]  I did. And that's what opened me.
[2:27:31.740 --> 2:27:39.740]  You know, it makes me angry because I know so many of these so-called whistleblowers of the New York Times has that exposes the radicalization. They never were who they say they were.
[2:27:39.740 --> 2:27:47.740]  A lot of times they're being paid to tell this story about I was a bad person. It turned me into this bad person. And then you learn it's made up and they were paid.
[2:27:47.740 --> 2:27:53.740]  I don't know about that guy in that particular article, but I've experienced people paid to literally tell total lies.
[2:27:53.740 --> 2:28:00.740]  And it doesn't hurt me as a person. It hurts me to know that there are that many immoral bad people out there that are just trying to get a paycheck.
[2:28:00.740 --> 2:28:06.740]  You know, and I know people are saying I'm trying to get my 15 minutes of fame, too.
[2:28:06.740 --> 2:28:10.740]  I just blew the whistle, wanted to throw the story out there and let people make it.
[2:28:10.740 --> 2:28:16.740]  Oh my gosh, stick a fork in CNN. That's a zombie operation. Everybody knows they lie constantly. They're constantly getting caught.
[2:28:16.740 --> 2:28:20.740]  We're going to go to break. I promise go to the calls. Robert Barnes is going to be here. Then he's going to host.
[2:28:20.740 --> 2:28:28.740]  You say you love Barnes. Well, I mean, I want to be with Barnes so you guys will co-host together coming up in the fourth hour.
[2:28:28.740 --> 2:28:32.740]  I'm about to tell a YouTube story, but I don't have time to do it, so it'll be for another day.
[2:28:32.740 --> 2:28:37.740]  But just briefly, people are asking me, what's your contact with Google and YouTube back when I worked with them?
[2:28:37.740 --> 2:28:44.740]  And it was like, hey, we want more police brutality videos. And it was that story about eight years ago sort of waking me up that they'd monetize something.
[2:28:44.740 --> 2:28:50.740]  I made cops look bad, but wouldn't show something and would block it if it showed a cop as good.
[2:28:50.740 --> 2:28:56.740]  And that was part of my even bigger wake up. I mean, all cops are perfect, but it just meant that agenda of creating a civil war in America.
[2:28:56.740 --> 2:29:02.740]  That's one little microcosm that changed my view on the police was Google was going to pay me to put cops down.
[2:29:27.740 --> 2:29:33.740]  Right on the East Bank of the Mississippi. Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location.
[2:29:33.740 --> 2:29:41.740]  And rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwaters backstory.
[2:29:41.740 --> 2:29:49.740]  So here's what you should do right now. Check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com. That's myownpowergrid.com.
[2:29:49.740 --> 2:29:56.740]  Here are the facts. Iodine raises IQ and across the board makes you more healthy in thousands of top studies, including the American Medical Journal.
[2:29:56.740 --> 2:30:00.740]  Every type of fluoride that you have in your life, you're going to have to go to myownpowergrid.com to learn more.
[2:30:00.740 --> 2:30:20.740]  That's myownpowergrid.com.
[2:30:31.740 --> 2:30:37.740]  The reason I'm so hot on this is the globalists put the fluoride in the water while making sure we don't get the iodine.
[2:30:37.740 --> 2:30:43.740]  In China, they put the iodine in the water and ban the fluoride because they've already got their people under their control.
[2:30:43.740 --> 2:30:47.740]  The globalists are targeting us here. Please go to myownpowergrid.com.
[2:30:47.740 --> 2:30:51.740]  Experience iodine and bio-trustillinium that goes with it together.
[2:30:51.740 --> 2:30:56.740]  And then once you see the great results, warn others. This is the Achilles Hill of the globalist.
[2:30:56.740 --> 2:31:00.740]  It's a win-win situation. The only way you lose is not taking action. Take action now.
[2:31:27.740 --> 2:31:30.740]  You've got to have oxygen to live. Okay, it's the same thing.
[2:31:30.740 --> 2:31:36.740]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, the bad halogen is fluoride. That's why in every western nation, they put it in the water.
[2:31:36.740 --> 2:31:41.740]  They're going to teach us Christians lay down and die. The chai-coms don't put it in the water. They'd execute you if you did that.
[2:31:41.740 --> 2:31:49.740]  They put iodine in the water because it's the good halogen and increases fertility and lifespan and intelligence and everything else.
[2:31:49.740 --> 2:31:56.740]  So again, learn about the iodine conspiracy at infoorstore.com. We have all the documents and articles linked.
[2:31:56.740 --> 2:32:00.740]  And then get good iodine for yourself because the globalists are fighting to make sure you don't.
[2:32:00.740 --> 2:32:21.740]  Again, get iodine at infoorstore.com.
[2:32:30.740 --> 2:32:37.740]  This works so well, but now because of liability and because of people warning inside the government what's happening,
[2:32:37.740 --> 2:32:43.740]  the Journal of American Medical Association and others are admitting what we've done and it makes me so angry.
[2:32:43.740 --> 2:32:50.740]  So whatever you do, just stay in that haze and drink fluoride and give it to your children.
[2:32:50.740 --> 2:32:54.740]  And don't visit infoorstore.com and learn about the iodine conspiracy.
[2:32:54.740 --> 2:33:07.740]  And get 60% off on X2 and X3 together with Biotrysolidium from the mustard seed. Submit to us at infoorstore.com.
[2:33:07.740 --> 2:33:15.740]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:33:15.740 --> 2:33:26.740]  I've got a tiger by the tail to explain the sea. I won't be much when you get through with me.
[2:33:26.740 --> 2:33:36.740]  He never gives up. He's Alex Jones, broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas worldwide.
[2:33:36.740 --> 2:33:41.740]  I had one of the producers come in here and say, man, you really wound up today what's going on.
[2:33:41.740 --> 2:33:45.740]  I'm working out a lot more these days and the news has got me crazy.
[2:33:45.740 --> 2:33:53.740]  And then I got to talk to you later, Robert, about the guest I've got on Friday. It's so big.
[2:33:53.740 --> 2:33:57.740]  And they don't even realize how big it is, but it deals with Trump. It deals with the campaign.
[2:33:57.740 --> 2:34:02.740]  It just deals with a bunch of big stuff and really how the Democrats have infiltrated the Trump campaign.
[2:34:02.740 --> 2:34:06.740]  And folks, we don't make stuff up here. I get things wrong.
[2:34:06.740 --> 2:34:11.740]  Barnes just said, you know Trump hasn't sued CNN yet. It's the intent to.
[2:34:11.740 --> 2:34:14.740]  And I'm like, I actually know that. Why did I say he sued them?
[2:34:14.740 --> 2:34:18.740]  I get things wrong quite a bit. Like I said, your wife, it's his fiance.
[2:34:18.740 --> 2:34:32.740]  But I don't do it on purpose. But when it comes to big, breaking things, like two years ago saying that Fiona Hill is the Soros Mall was going to set Trump up later for quid pro quo.
[2:34:32.740 --> 2:34:42.740]  We let it all out, folks. Roger Stone. There's a reason they want Roger Stone in prison and I have been threatened from the highest levels to not have Roger Stone on.
[2:34:42.740 --> 2:34:54.740]  Okay. And other people, well, let's just say this is up at that level and it's going to be big Friday and it ties into the White House and it gets into Brad Parscale and all the rest of it.
[2:34:54.740 --> 2:35:04.740]  So constitutional lawyer, par excellence, Robert Barnes here. He rides shotgun hell. He's here about a month out of the about a about a week out of the month.
[2:35:04.740 --> 2:35:09.740]  And of course we have Carrie porch here, the big CNN whistleblower and loaded phone lines. I need to get to them.
[2:35:09.740 --> 2:35:15.740]  But first off, we're going to go to your buddy who wanted to call in. I'm glad he did Scott Goldsmith, one of the veteran buddies you had from Iraq.
[2:35:15.740 --> 2:35:19.740]  He wants to comment on things and I promise I'm going to go to Chris, Michael, Ryan, solo and Johnny.
[2:35:19.740 --> 2:35:23.740]  But any other points you guys want to add before we start getting to these clips and calls?
[2:35:23.740 --> 2:35:28.740]  Sorry, what would you like to know? I mean, it was just so much. I mean, you've got a wheel. Well, I mean, I see the callers.
[2:35:28.740 --> 2:35:34.740]  They're going to ask this question. What was the last straw? Why did you do it? We're going to go to, you know, Michael here in the calls.
[2:35:34.740 --> 2:35:38.740]  What caused the guest to blow the whistle finally? You already said it's a process.
[2:35:38.740 --> 2:35:44.740]  Yeah, it wasn't a it wasn't a singular event for me. It was a process kind of like grains of sand on a weight scale.
[2:35:44.740 --> 2:35:49.740]  And it just I can't remember the exact last grain of sand. It just it just tipped finally.
[2:35:49.740 --> 2:35:53.740]  And I always have a thousand questions. My problem is I interrupt too much.
[2:35:53.740 --> 2:35:58.740]  I just always love to say, what's your bottom line? Because that's when you get the coolest info.
[2:35:58.740 --> 2:36:02.740]  What's your bottom line right now? What's on your radar screen, Barnes, your big brain?
[2:36:02.740 --> 2:36:07.740]  Well, I mean, I think what you see is the effect that you're talking about is a common whistleblower effect.
[2:36:07.740 --> 2:36:12.740]  And it was most people who go in want to sort of believe in what they're doing, believe and participate in it.
[2:36:12.740 --> 2:36:18.740]  And when they start seeing things, they usually start off with like jurors in a case that won a certain outcome.
[2:36:18.740 --> 2:36:21.740]  They keep trying to filter the evidence in a particular direction.
[2:36:21.740 --> 2:36:27.740]  And they keep trying to say, well, maybe that meant this or maybe that was this or maybe that's isolated problem over here.
[2:36:27.740 --> 2:36:31.740]  Or maybe that's just this problem over there. And it's it's it is the accumulation.
[2:36:31.740 --> 2:36:39.740]  It's when you can no longer come up with any explanation for what's taking place other than this is a group of rogue actors and bad actors
[2:36:39.740 --> 2:36:43.740]  that have to be exposed for any meaningful change or reform to take place.
[2:36:43.740 --> 2:36:46.740]  What change do you hope takes place because of what you've done?
[2:36:46.740 --> 2:36:51.740]  That's the that's the end goal. That's what I mean, obviously, I can't speak for James personally, but that's what I wanted.
[2:36:51.740 --> 2:36:59.740]  I mean, I've said it on a few tapes already that I wanted one of two things, either CNN and others to just publicly own where they're at.
[2:36:59.740 --> 2:37:06.740]  Cool. We know we're getting right or to return to the greatness, the bastion of old, the most trusted name in news, you know, return to that.
[2:37:06.740 --> 2:37:08.740]  The CNN that I loved, you know, the one.
[2:37:08.740 --> 2:37:12.740]  Oh, my gosh, I remember my grandpa, you know, then like 1981 watching it.
[2:37:12.740 --> 2:37:18.740]  And it was exciting. It was real debates. And I mean, back when Tucker Carlson was on crossfire, those were real debates.
[2:37:18.740 --> 2:37:20.740]  And that's back when they had 10 million viewers an hour.
[2:37:20.740 --> 2:37:23.740]  Yeah. Again, it isn't the Internet that killed CNN.
[2:37:23.740 --> 2:37:26.740]  It's the fact that they are just so it's all one message.
[2:37:26.740 --> 2:37:33.740]  No doubt. I mean, I remember talking to Bernard Shaw back in the day about how embarrassed they were over what happened over the incubator baby story.
[2:37:33.740 --> 2:37:38.740]  I'm saying how did you guys get that wrong? How did you guys allow that sort of pro war propaganda to take place?
[2:37:38.740 --> 2:37:43.740]  And he was embarrassed. He said, we didn't ask the right questions. We didn't do our job. We need to meet meaningful reform.
[2:37:43.740 --> 2:37:48.740]  And instead, they've gone in a completely radical, overtly partisan, different direction.
[2:37:48.740 --> 2:37:53.740]  I was watching it yesterday and the gap between it and the other news stations is so huge.
[2:37:53.740 --> 2:37:57.740]  All they would cover is impeachment. All they would cover is excuses to impeach.
[2:37:57.740 --> 2:38:04.740]  And it is sad to see a great brand, a once great brand diminish itself to a weak partisan advocate.
[2:38:04.740 --> 2:38:07.740]  And CNN trailblaze. It was the first time our cable news station.
[2:38:07.740 --> 2:38:09.740]  That's true. And worldwide.
[2:38:09.740 --> 2:38:14.740]  I want to go to these calls. We'll never get to them. But this Tulsi Gabbard's clip is is piggly wiggly out of Illinois.
[2:38:14.740 --> 2:38:18.740]  The guy that literally helped get us off the Internet by lying about us.
[2:38:18.740 --> 2:38:25.740]  I mean, a guy would literally scream, all is great. You know, there's only one God, all that stuff they yell all Akbar.
[2:38:25.740 --> 2:38:29.740]  It was an ISIS attack in New York. He said it wasn't. They took ball story off Twitter.
[2:38:29.740 --> 2:38:36.740]  Now here he is agreeing that Tulsi Gabbard's needs to be looked at as a Russian spy with no evidence.
[2:38:36.740 --> 2:38:37.740]  Here it is.
[2:38:37.740 --> 2:38:38.740]  Use of power.
[2:38:38.740 --> 2:38:43.740]  Congressman, before we go, I want to ask you about something else the president talked about today,
[2:38:43.740 --> 2:38:46.740]  which is the accusation by Hillary Clinton against your fellow sitting congresswoman,
[2:38:46.740 --> 2:38:49.740]  2020 Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard.
[2:38:49.740 --> 2:38:54.740]  Clinton said the Russians are grooming Gabbard to run as a third party candidate to champion their interests,
[2:38:54.740 --> 2:38:59.740]  referring, you know, to her being possibly a Russian asset.
[2:38:59.740 --> 2:39:02.740]  Here's what Trump said about that today.
[2:39:02.740 --> 2:39:09.740]  Hillary Clinton, if you've heard of her, she's the one that's accusing everybody of being a Russian agent.
[2:39:09.740 --> 2:39:12.740]  Anybody that is opposed to her is a Russian agent.
[2:39:12.740 --> 2:39:16.740]  So that's a scam that was pretty much put down.
[2:39:16.740 --> 2:39:20.740]  Tulsi, I don't know Tulsi, but she's not a Russian agent.
[2:39:20.740 --> 2:39:27.740]  Congressman, do you think congresswoman Gabbard is a Russian asset that she's being used by Russians?
[2:39:27.740 --> 2:39:33.740]  I simply don't have any knowledge or information on this, partly because I've been focused on this.
[2:39:33.740 --> 2:39:38.740]  And the fact of the matter is Hillary Clinton has a right to be upset.
[2:39:38.740 --> 2:39:43.740]  The Russians did a full, throttle attack on her and the entire intelligence community agreed,
[2:39:43.740 --> 2:39:47.740]  all 17 entities with a high level of certainty that the Russians-
[2:39:47.740 --> 2:39:48.740]  High level of certainty.
[2:39:48.740 --> 2:39:49.740]  Let's stop there.
[2:39:49.740 --> 2:39:51.740]  Barnes, what does it mean when you hear high level of certainty?
[2:39:51.740 --> 2:39:55.740]  It means lack of evidence when it comes to the intelligence community.
[2:39:55.740 --> 2:39:56.740]  High level of certainty about WMDs.
[2:39:56.740 --> 2:39:57.740]  Exactly.
[2:39:57.740 --> 2:40:01.740]  What's interesting there is the NSA, which was the only competent agency to determine that issue,
[2:40:01.740 --> 2:40:04.740]  refused to even use the high level of certainty language.
[2:40:04.740 --> 2:40:09.740]  Instead, they said moderate level of certainty, which meant, okay, this is all BS and we know it is-
[2:40:09.740 --> 2:40:11.740]  You're right, that's another lie. All 17 didn't say that.
[2:40:11.740 --> 2:40:12.740]  Correct, exactly.
[2:40:12.740 --> 2:40:16.740]  Well, there is no such, really, such agencies for that purpose.
[2:40:16.740 --> 2:40:19.740]  Really, the NSA is the only agency that could try to make that determination,
[2:40:19.740 --> 2:40:23.740]  and they couldn't come to even a high level of quote-a-quote certainty.
[2:40:23.740 --> 2:40:26.740]  They couldn't produce any direct evidence and support of it.
[2:40:26.740 --> 2:40:28.740]  And so it's just the nature of it.
[2:40:28.740 --> 2:40:33.740]  And the fact that a Democratic congressperson is sitting there,
[2:40:33.740 --> 2:40:36.740]  unwilling to defend his fellow Democratic congresswoman,
[2:40:36.740 --> 2:40:38.740]  because Hillary Clinton has said-
[2:40:38.740 --> 2:40:42.740]  Hillary has a right to lie about people and destroy them.
[2:40:42.740 --> 2:40:45.740]  I mean, they took us off the Internet saying I was a Russian agent.
[2:40:45.740 --> 2:40:46.740]  It's asinine.
[2:40:46.740 --> 2:40:47.740]  Completely.
[2:40:47.740 --> 2:40:50.740]  And for CNN to become sort of the political hack agency.
[2:40:50.740 --> 2:40:53.740]  I mean, most people's families, I never fought Russians,
[2:40:53.740 --> 2:40:56.740]  but I have a family that literally did fight the Russians in Europe
[2:40:56.740 --> 2:40:58.740]  and Central and South America.
[2:40:58.740 --> 2:40:59.740]  Right.
[2:40:59.740 --> 2:41:01.740]  Okay, and so just like, I mean, it's asinine.
[2:41:01.740 --> 2:41:02.740]  Oh, completely.
[2:41:02.740 --> 2:41:05.740]  Well, and I think what you were talking about earlier
[2:41:05.740 --> 2:41:07.740]  in terms of blowing the whistle on CNN
[2:41:07.740 --> 2:41:11.740]  is that CNN has become sort of the intel agency's operation,
[2:41:11.740 --> 2:41:13.740]  the Democratic Party's operation.
[2:41:13.740 --> 2:41:16.740]  It's no longer sort of the independent, discreet, investigative,
[2:41:16.740 --> 2:41:18.740]  journalistic brand, it once was.
[2:41:18.740 --> 2:41:21.740]  An old friend of mine who got multiple awards in journalism school,
[2:41:21.740 --> 2:41:24.740]  multiple got all kinds of grants to do independent journalism,
[2:41:24.740 --> 2:41:27.740]  went to CNN and was bitterly disappointed by her experience
[2:41:27.740 --> 2:41:30.740]  because of the story she could not tell,
[2:41:30.740 --> 2:41:31.740]  because it didn't fit-
[2:41:31.740 --> 2:41:32.740]  And that's the lie by omission.
[2:41:32.740 --> 2:41:33.740]  Yeah.
[2:41:33.740 --> 2:41:34.740]  Who is the lion?
[2:41:34.740 --> 2:41:35.740]  A pretty blonde lady.
[2:41:35.740 --> 2:41:37.740]  She was on like 10 years ago.
[2:41:37.740 --> 2:41:38.740]  Lisa-
[2:41:38.740 --> 2:41:39.740]  No, it was something lion.
[2:41:39.740 --> 2:41:41.740]  Lisa lion is the Coast Coast producer.
[2:41:41.740 --> 2:41:42.740]  Something lion.
[2:41:42.740 --> 2:41:44.740]  And she was there and watched Qatar and all these people
[2:41:44.740 --> 2:41:47.740]  paying like a half million dollars for CNN to do fake reports.
[2:41:47.740 --> 2:41:50.740]  And she couldn't be part of it.
[2:41:50.740 --> 2:41:51.740]  There's been other whistleblowers.
[2:41:51.740 --> 2:41:52.740]  There just wasn't Veritas,
[2:41:52.740 --> 2:41:55.740]  wasn't there to, I guess, get them on at the time.
[2:41:55.740 --> 2:41:56.740]  And thankful to them.
[2:41:56.740 --> 2:41:59.740]  I mean, the story couldn't have been told without them.
[2:41:59.740 --> 2:42:00.740]  I mean, we see that.
[2:42:00.740 --> 2:42:04.740]  I mean, I said it last night at Texas A&M.
[2:42:04.740 --> 2:42:07.740]  I mean, they made everything relatively easy to come forward.
[2:42:07.740 --> 2:42:09.740]  And I'd like to think that, you know,
[2:42:09.740 --> 2:42:12.740]  I would have been able to come forward without that type of support,
[2:42:12.740 --> 2:42:13.740]  but I don't know if I would have.
[2:42:13.740 --> 2:42:15.740]  By the way, it was Amber Lion.
[2:42:15.740 --> 2:42:17.740]  We should get Amber Lion back on.
[2:42:17.740 --> 2:42:18.740]  She hadn't been on like eight years.
[2:42:18.740 --> 2:42:19.740]  She's a great lady.
[2:42:19.740 --> 2:42:22.740]  You know, when Michael Hastings got killed,
[2:42:22.740 --> 2:42:25.740]  she decided to retire.
[2:42:25.740 --> 2:42:27.740]  You know, they whacked Michael Hastings.
[2:42:27.740 --> 2:42:28.740]  They blew his car up.
[2:42:28.740 --> 2:42:31.740]  That engine shot down the road about 500 feet.
[2:42:31.740 --> 2:42:32.740]  Wow.
[2:42:32.740 --> 2:42:34.740]  That's an unfortunate way to die.
[2:42:34.740 --> 2:42:36.740]  So the, I mean, the-
[2:42:36.740 --> 2:42:37.740]  Lisa's quick.
[2:42:37.740 --> 2:42:38.740]  Well, yeah, I guess that's true.
[2:42:38.740 --> 2:42:39.740]  I guess that's true.
[2:42:39.740 --> 2:42:40.740]  But no question.
[2:42:40.740 --> 2:42:43.740]  The importance of whistleblowers exposing the problems of the way
[2:42:43.740 --> 2:42:46.740]  the institutionalized media operates is critical
[2:42:46.740 --> 2:42:49.740]  to restoring any degree of independent media moving forward.
[2:42:49.740 --> 2:42:51.740]  And a true free press going forward.
[2:42:51.740 --> 2:42:52.740]  And that's all we want, Mr. Barnes.
[2:42:52.740 --> 2:42:56.740]  And I mean, I'm not naive enough to think that CNN's going to take this lying down.
[2:42:56.740 --> 2:42:59.740]  So my family and I were bracing for whatever comes next, you know?
[2:42:59.740 --> 2:43:00.740]  Right.
[2:43:00.740 --> 2:43:01.740]  They're going to leave you alone.
[2:43:01.740 --> 2:43:02.740]  I don't want to draw more attention to this.
[2:43:02.740 --> 2:43:03.740]  Your calls are coming up.
[2:43:03.740 --> 2:43:06.740]  Infowars presents Alex Jones.
[2:43:06.740 --> 2:43:08.740]  In August of 2019,
[2:43:08.740 --> 2:43:11.740]  JAMA, or the Journal of the American Medical Association,
[2:43:11.740 --> 2:43:13.740]  the most prestigious came out and said,
[2:43:13.740 --> 2:43:17.740]  oh, my gosh, just a little bit of fluoride in the water causes lowered IQs,
[2:43:17.740 --> 2:43:20.740]  massive infertility, and a lot of babies dying in the womb,
[2:43:20.740 --> 2:43:21.740]  and it causes cancer.
[2:43:21.740 --> 2:43:24.740]  That was just one of thousands of studies admitting this.
[2:43:24.740 --> 2:43:28.740]  You know, it's illegal to have even one part per billion in the water,
[2:43:28.740 --> 2:43:29.740]  in places like California,
[2:43:29.740 --> 2:43:31.740]  unless it's part of adding fluoride.
[2:43:31.740 --> 2:43:36.740]  And then they have a waiver and can add thousands of deadly chemicals to your water
[2:43:36.740 --> 2:43:38.740]  because the liberals love you,
[2:43:38.740 --> 2:43:40.740]  and they want to sexualize your children.
[2:43:40.740 --> 2:43:43.740]  So whatever you do, drink lots of fluoride,
[2:43:43.740 --> 2:43:46.740]  and don't get the thing that counters iodine at infowarstore.com.
[2:43:46.740 --> 2:43:49.740]  Drink fluoride and die.
[2:43:49.740 --> 2:43:52.740]  Drink fluoride, dirty Americans, and roll over.
[2:43:52.740 --> 2:43:56.740]  Do not visit infowarstore.com and get high-poly iodine to counter it.
[2:43:56.740 --> 2:44:21.740]  No, roll over and die, dirty Americans.
[2:44:26.740 --> 2:44:28.740]  Drink the fluoride.
[2:44:28.740 --> 2:44:32.740]  Don't visit infowarstore.com and get the good halogen.
[2:44:32.740 --> 2:44:34.740]  I mean the bad halogen iodine.
[2:44:34.740 --> 2:44:37.740]  Don't give it to yourself, your husband, your wife, your children.
[2:44:37.740 --> 2:44:44.740]  Just drink the fluoride and plunge into subservience to us.
[2:44:44.740 --> 2:44:46.740]  We don't want to compete with you.
[2:44:46.740 --> 2:44:48.740]  Just drink the fluoride.
[2:44:48.740 --> 2:44:52.740]  Don't learn about how deadly it is and whatever you do.
[2:44:52.740 --> 2:44:54.740]  Don't support Alex Jones.
[2:44:54.740 --> 2:44:58.740]  Remember, I'm speaking with a soft voice, so I'm a liberal.
[2:44:58.740 --> 2:45:04.740]  Oh, and let Namble have access to your children.
[2:45:04.740 --> 2:45:07.740]  Now, what I'm about to say is incredibly obvious,
[2:45:07.740 --> 2:45:10.740]  and I'm not talking down to any of the viewers or any of the listeners.
[2:45:10.740 --> 2:45:11.740]  I'm just stating the facts.
[2:45:11.740 --> 2:45:14.740]  I own a chainsaw. I've had it since I was in college.
[2:45:14.740 --> 2:45:16.740]  And it's a great, good old chainsaw,
[2:45:16.740 --> 2:45:18.740]  and I've used it probably 500 times.
[2:45:18.740 --> 2:45:21.740]  But a few times I've forgotten to oil it,
[2:45:21.740 --> 2:45:23.740]  and it seizes up really quick,
[2:45:23.740 --> 2:45:25.740]  and I feel like an idiot for not oiling it.
[2:45:25.740 --> 2:45:28.740]  Now, imagine if somebody told me to put,
[2:45:28.740 --> 2:45:31.740]  let's say Super Glue in the oil container on it.
[2:45:31.740 --> 2:45:33.740]  It would seize up forever,
[2:45:33.740 --> 2:45:35.740]  but only an evil person would do that.
[2:45:35.740 --> 2:45:38.740]  Well, fluorides like putting Super Glue in a chainsaw,
[2:45:38.740 --> 2:45:39.740]  it's going to make it seize up,
[2:45:39.740 --> 2:45:41.740]  and that's why they put it in the water,
[2:45:41.740 --> 2:45:43.740]  and they admit they're doing it to hurt you and your family.
[2:45:43.740 --> 2:45:44.740]  Yes, they're really evil.
[2:45:44.740 --> 2:45:47.740]  Iodine is like putting oil in the chainsaw
[2:45:47.740 --> 2:45:49.740]  to help with the gasoline lubrication.
[2:45:49.740 --> 2:45:50.740]  It's that simple.
[2:45:50.740 --> 2:45:51.740]  I know you understand this,
[2:45:51.740 --> 2:45:53.740]  but let's warn other people before it's too late.
[2:45:53.740 --> 2:45:55.740]  It's part of the Iodine conspiracy.
[2:45:55.740 --> 2:45:57.740]  Find out more at m4store.com
[2:45:57.740 --> 2:45:59.740]  and take action against the globalist.
[2:45:59.740 --> 2:46:01.740]  Carbon's everywhere on this planet.
[2:46:01.740 --> 2:46:04.740]  It's almost like we're carbon-based life forms.
[2:46:04.740 --> 2:46:05.740]  Please listen to this information
[2:46:05.740 --> 2:46:07.740]  because it can save your life,
[2:46:07.740 --> 2:46:09.740]  and it can save the life of others.
[2:46:09.740 --> 2:46:11.740]  There couldn't be more critical information
[2:46:11.740 --> 2:46:12.740]  for your physical body.
[2:46:12.740 --> 2:46:14.740]  God's more important when it comes to your soul,
[2:46:14.740 --> 2:46:17.740]  but this is most important when it comes to your body.
[2:46:17.740 --> 2:46:20.740]  If people didn't know that you put motor oil
[2:46:20.740 --> 2:46:23.740]  in a car's oil container to lube the engine,
[2:46:23.740 --> 2:46:25.740]  they might be able to be conned
[2:46:25.740 --> 2:46:27.740]  and think you put saltwater in it,
[2:46:27.740 --> 2:46:30.740]  but it would seize up the engine pretty much instantly.
[2:46:30.740 --> 2:46:32.740]  Well, if they put fluoride in the human body,
[2:46:32.740 --> 2:46:35.740]  it causes cancer, dumps us down, and destroys fertility.
[2:46:35.740 --> 2:46:37.740]  If you put the good halogen in the body,
[2:46:37.740 --> 2:46:38.740]  high-quality iodine,
[2:46:38.740 --> 2:46:41.740]  it's like putting good, high-quality motor oil
[2:46:41.740 --> 2:46:43.740]  in the car that's supposed to run on it.
[2:46:43.740 --> 2:46:44.740]  It's that simple.
[2:46:44.740 --> 2:46:45.740]  Find out about the Iodine conspiracy
[2:46:45.740 --> 2:46:47.740]  at m4store.com
[2:46:47.740 --> 2:46:48.740]  and find out what the globalist hope
[2:46:48.740 --> 2:46:50.740]  that you do not research this information.
[2:46:50.740 --> 2:46:52.740]  Ladies and gentlemen, whatever you do,
[2:46:52.740 --> 2:46:54.740]  research iodine deficiency.
[2:46:54.740 --> 2:46:56.740]  It's the key to everything.
[2:46:56.740 --> 2:46:59.740]  And then go and take advantage of the 60% off combo
[2:46:59.740 --> 2:47:01.740]  with our two different types of high-quality iodine
[2:47:01.740 --> 2:47:26.740]  and biotrystallinium at m4store.com today.
[2:47:26.740 --> 2:47:27.740]  And Robert Barnes is riding a shotgun.
[2:47:27.740 --> 2:47:29.740]  These guys are gonna be together in the next hour.
[2:47:29.740 --> 2:47:31.740]  He's gonna take a break, carry his.
[2:47:31.740 --> 2:47:32.740]  Barnes has got a lot to cover
[2:47:32.740 --> 2:47:33.740]  and then he'll come back in the last 30.
[2:47:33.740 --> 2:47:35.740]  But I wanna go to your calls these two segments.
[2:47:35.740 --> 2:47:37.740]  And I get so excited about all the things
[2:47:37.740 --> 2:47:39.740]  that are happening, like the homeless
[2:47:39.740 --> 2:47:41.740]  starting to get microchipped in Austin.
[2:47:41.740 --> 2:47:44.740]  That made me the three cups of coffee
[2:47:44.740 --> 2:47:45.740]  feel like 10 right now.
[2:47:45.740 --> 2:47:47.740]  Okay, I mean, I've been up since 5 a.m.
[2:47:47.740 --> 2:47:48.740]  I've had three cups of coffee.
[2:47:48.740 --> 2:47:49.740]  That doesn't normally have me
[2:47:49.740 --> 2:47:51.740]  like a whirling dervish here.
[2:47:51.740 --> 2:47:53.740]  I mean, I am freaked out over that article
[2:47:53.740 --> 2:47:55.740]  that's confirmed on m4store.com.
[2:47:55.740 --> 2:47:57.740]  It is just so crazy.
[2:47:57.740 --> 2:47:59.740]  I don't know how to even respond to that.
[2:47:59.740 --> 2:48:00.740]  I feel like I'm not doing a good enough job.
[2:48:00.740 --> 2:48:02.740]  It's just crazy.
[2:48:02.740 --> 2:48:04.740]  I'll be back this afternoon
[2:48:04.740 --> 2:48:06.740]  after Kerry leaves the war room
[2:48:06.740 --> 2:48:07.740]  because I wanna get more into that.
[2:48:07.740 --> 2:48:08.740]  There's so much going on.
[2:48:08.740 --> 2:48:09.740]  Robert Barnes will be with us
[2:48:09.740 --> 2:48:11.740]  throughout the rest of the week.
[2:48:11.740 --> 2:48:12.740]  I didn't plug last hour
[2:48:12.740 --> 2:48:14.740]  and I'm not really plugged this hour.
[2:48:14.740 --> 2:48:15.740]  Most talk shows plug every segment
[2:48:15.740 --> 2:48:17.740]  and that's good because that's how you fund yourself.
[2:48:17.740 --> 2:48:19.740]  We got great specials.
[2:48:19.740 --> 2:48:21.740]  I'm gonna have to end the Everything Must Go sale
[2:48:21.740 --> 2:48:23.740]  because so much stuff is getting close to selling out.
[2:48:23.740 --> 2:48:26.740]  We've got the iodine challenge.
[2:48:26.740 --> 2:48:28.740]  We get 60% off on the X2 and X3
[2:48:28.740 --> 2:48:31.740]  with the bio tricillinium that supercharges it.
[2:48:31.740 --> 2:48:33.740]  That's 60% off right now.
[2:48:33.740 --> 2:48:35.740]  That is a great deal.
[2:48:35.740 --> 2:48:36.740]  Research this for yourself.
[2:48:36.740 --> 2:48:38.740]  We have only a couple hundred left
[2:48:38.740 --> 2:48:41.740]  of the electropure breeze, four-stage ion filter,
[2:48:41.740 --> 2:48:42.740]  40% off.
[2:48:42.740 --> 2:48:43.740]  That's very close to cost.
[2:48:43.740 --> 2:48:45.740]  I make 30-something dollars.
[2:48:45.740 --> 2:48:48.740]  The maker makes 30-something dollars, by the way, folks.
[2:48:48.740 --> 2:48:51.740]  They're the same folks that make the electropure water filters
[2:48:51.740 --> 2:48:52.740]  that are the highest rated out there.
[2:48:52.740 --> 2:48:54.740]  Go look it up, third parties.
[2:48:54.740 --> 2:48:57.740]  Well, other similar filters are 600 bucks on average.
[2:48:57.740 --> 2:48:59.740]  They just don't mark it up that much
[2:48:59.740 --> 2:49:01.740]  and usually make 50 bucks and I make 50 bucks.
[2:49:01.740 --> 2:49:04.740]  Well, at this price, we're making 33 or 34.
[2:49:04.740 --> 2:49:05.740]  They're doing that.
[2:49:05.740 --> 2:49:06.740]  You really need this in your house.
[2:49:06.740 --> 2:49:08.740]  It's the next great system
[2:49:08.740 --> 2:49:10.740]  and it doesn't have all the crazy markup
[2:49:10.740 --> 2:49:12.740]  and it works just as good as some fancy stainless steel
[2:49:12.740 --> 2:49:13.740]  thingamajigger.
[2:49:13.740 --> 2:49:15.740]  It has the four filters
[2:49:15.740 --> 2:49:17.740]  and it's very easy to clean once a month.
[2:49:17.740 --> 2:49:19.740]  The outside filter, you just spray it off the water hose
[2:49:19.740 --> 2:49:22.740]  and you and your children really owe it to yourself to get it.
[2:49:22.740 --> 2:49:23.740]  It's about to sell out.
[2:49:23.740 --> 2:49:25.740]  Okay, let's go to calls.
[2:49:25.740 --> 2:49:26.740]  I'm going to go to Carlos.
[2:49:26.740 --> 2:49:30.740]  I'm going to go to Johnny, Solo, Ryan, Michael, and Chris.
[2:49:30.740 --> 2:49:33.740]  But let's go to your buddy, Scott Goldsmith,
[2:49:33.740 --> 2:49:35.740]  that you know from Iraq, another veteran.
[2:49:35.740 --> 2:49:36.740]  Thanks for holding Scott. You're on the air.
[2:49:36.740 --> 2:49:38.740]  Isn't this guy a trooper, Scott?
[2:49:38.740 --> 2:49:41.740]  Oh, this is Phantom, a Chinese dragon.
[2:49:41.740 --> 2:49:44.740]  He'll take over your country, a stupid American.
[2:49:44.740 --> 2:49:49.740]  Oh, I see AI break in beside Scott Goldsmith.
[2:49:49.740 --> 2:49:52.740]  Scott Goldsmith has credit score gone now.
[2:49:52.740 --> 2:49:55.740]  So now I'm going to be some China break in.
[2:49:55.740 --> 2:50:00.740]  Oh, you're not the only saying we're up Ron James.
[2:50:00.740 --> 2:50:01.740]  Yeah.
[2:50:01.740 --> 2:50:05.740]  Told you he's a long listener.
[2:50:05.740 --> 2:50:07.740]  I'm sorry, Fenton. Go ahead.
[2:50:07.740 --> 2:50:09.740]  I'm sorry. How are you doing, Alex?
[2:50:09.740 --> 2:50:11.740]  Hey, Kerry, what's up, brother?
[2:50:11.740 --> 2:50:13.740]  Hey, long time no talking person, man.
[2:50:13.740 --> 2:50:15.740]  It's good to hear your voice, brother. How are you?
[2:50:15.740 --> 2:50:16.740]  Yeah, it's been a while.
[2:50:16.740 --> 2:50:20.740]  It's been since March since the operation started, I remember.
[2:50:20.740 --> 2:50:22.740]  As good as good times.
[2:50:22.740 --> 2:50:24.740]  The funny part is Goldie here.
[2:50:24.740 --> 2:50:27.740]  Actually, we were messaging and he's like,
[2:50:27.740 --> 2:50:29.740]  like I was talking to him like, hey, I'm just seeing some stuff.
[2:50:29.740 --> 2:50:32.740]  And it was already when James O'Keeffe and I met,
[2:50:32.740 --> 2:50:34.740]  he's like, you should talk to Veritas.
[2:50:34.740 --> 2:50:39.740]  I'm like, dude, don't put this on the wire. I might be.
[2:50:39.740 --> 2:50:43.740]  So but him and him and we call him skate man and stuff.
[2:50:43.740 --> 2:50:45.740]  A lot of good people in Iraq still have a lot of good friends
[2:50:45.740 --> 2:50:47.740]  from overseas and our tours, but let me ask you this.
[2:50:47.740 --> 2:50:50.740]  Are you mad at Trump trying to get our troops out of there?
[2:50:50.740 --> 2:50:52.740]  Absolutely not.
[2:50:52.740 --> 2:50:54.740]  I mean, that's what he's doing.
[2:50:54.740 --> 2:50:57.740]  I'm going to put them on the southern border.
[2:50:57.740 --> 2:50:59.740]  Right.
[2:50:59.740 --> 2:51:01.740]  Well, what do you think of your buddy here?
[2:51:01.740 --> 2:51:03.740]  I mean, he's a hero.
[2:51:03.740 --> 2:51:05.740]  And Kerry was saying that he was scared before,
[2:51:05.740 --> 2:51:07.740]  but he feels great now that he did it.
[2:51:07.740 --> 2:51:11.740]  Yeah, he said, I don't want to get too personal there.
[2:51:11.740 --> 2:51:14.740]  Hopefully I'm not, but I know he has a fiance
[2:51:14.740 --> 2:51:16.740]  and he's about to have a child.
[2:51:16.740 --> 2:51:19.740]  He's going to have a personal tell us what it tells us his blood type.
[2:51:19.740 --> 2:51:22.740]  Yeah. Okay. And then, and I, and he said, and I told him,
[2:51:22.740 --> 2:51:24.740]  I was like, you know, you're not just doing it.
[2:51:24.740 --> 2:51:26.740]  You're doing it for the future. You're doing it for your future.
[2:51:26.740 --> 2:51:28.740]  Your child.
[2:51:28.740 --> 2:51:30.740]  And not only that, but you're doing it for my two boys
[2:51:30.740 --> 2:51:32.740]  that I have also 10 and six years old.
[2:51:32.740 --> 2:51:34.740]  That's awesome.
[2:51:34.740 --> 2:51:36.740]  He's doing the entire country service.
[2:51:36.740 --> 2:51:39.740]  Scott, I got to tell you, I got to tell you brother
[2:51:39.740 --> 2:51:42.740]  that it is real whistleblowers like this man
[2:51:42.740 --> 2:51:44.740]  that keep him scared and awake at night. Thank you, sir.
[2:51:44.740 --> 2:51:46.740]  And call back again anytime.
[2:51:46.740 --> 2:51:48.740]  We're going to go to more of these calls just briefly.
[2:51:48.740 --> 2:51:50.740]  Trump has been, has left the press alone,
[2:51:50.740 --> 2:51:52.740]  never gone after journalists, never gone after whistleblowers.
[2:51:52.740 --> 2:51:55.740]  But when he criticizes some nebulous fake whistleblower,
[2:51:55.740 --> 2:51:57.740]  then he's this big tyrant.
[2:51:57.740 --> 2:51:59.740]  Oh, it's extraordinary.
[2:51:59.740 --> 2:52:01.740]  Well, it's amazing.
[2:52:01.740 --> 2:52:04.740]  When the deep state has its own form of illegal leaking,
[2:52:04.740 --> 2:52:06.740]  they falsely label it whistleblower,
[2:52:06.740 --> 2:52:08.740]  sort of like deep throat.
[2:52:08.740 --> 2:52:10.740]  That's what deep throat Mark Felt was.
[2:52:10.740 --> 2:52:12.740]  He was the head of Cointel Pro for the FBI.
[2:52:12.740 --> 2:52:14.740]  He was wanting to dehooverize the FBI.
[2:52:14.740 --> 2:52:16.740]  So he was the guy leaking information in Intel.
[2:52:16.740 --> 2:52:18.740]  So here you have this similar dynamic.
[2:52:18.740 --> 2:52:20.740]  This is a deep state operatives
[2:52:20.740 --> 2:52:22.740]  operating spying on the White House,
[2:52:22.740 --> 2:52:24.740]  telling lies about the White House,
[2:52:24.740 --> 2:52:27.740]  leaking information illicitly about the White House.
[2:52:27.740 --> 2:52:29.740]  That if this had been done to President Obama,
[2:52:29.740 --> 2:52:32.740]  the entire Democratic political establishment
[2:52:32.740 --> 2:52:34.740]  and the media establishment would be enraged
[2:52:34.740 --> 2:52:37.740]  and up in arms and calling it the coup that it is.
[2:52:37.740 --> 2:52:40.740]  So it shows a degree to which this is an old script
[2:52:40.740 --> 2:52:42.740]  that they've played by,
[2:52:42.740 --> 2:52:44.740]  and that the real whistleblowers,
[2:52:44.740 --> 2:52:46.740]  they've gone after.
[2:52:46.740 --> 2:52:48.740]  The real whistleblowers deep state has targeted.
[2:52:48.740 --> 2:52:50.740]  And now this ambassador, Bill Taylor,
[2:52:50.740 --> 2:52:52.740]  says he never heard Trump.
[2:52:52.740 --> 2:52:54.740]  He heard from somebody, but he can't tell us who.
[2:52:54.740 --> 2:52:56.740]  This is ridiculous.
[2:52:56.740 --> 2:52:58.740]  And like you said, Chinese water torture.
[2:52:58.740 --> 2:53:00.740]  It'll be another whistleblower,
[2:53:00.740 --> 2:53:02.740]  another witness who saw nothing,
[2:53:02.740 --> 2:53:04.740]  but all 50 of them.
[2:53:04.740 --> 2:53:06.740]  Exactly. It's just to use the language and the lingo.
[2:53:06.740 --> 2:53:08.740]  And it's very much like the Taylor Panama,
[2:53:08.740 --> 2:53:10.740]  like the John Le Carr novel.
[2:53:10.740 --> 2:53:12.740]  These people are so used to being able to BS their way.
[2:53:12.740 --> 2:53:14.740]  They operate the way Spooks operate.
[2:53:14.740 --> 2:53:16.740]  They're used to being able to...
[2:53:16.740 --> 2:53:18.740]  Well, it is a bunch of Spooks.
[2:53:18.740 --> 2:53:20.740]  All right, let's get to more calls here.
[2:53:20.740 --> 2:53:22.740]  Let's talk to...
[2:53:22.740 --> 2:53:24.740]  Sorry, stop doing that.
[2:53:24.740 --> 2:53:26.740]  It makes me talk like that.
[2:53:26.740 --> 2:53:28.740]  Let's talk to Solo in Kentucky.
[2:53:28.740 --> 2:53:30.740]  Oh, we saw the Kurds bombed in Kentucky
[2:53:30.740 --> 2:53:32.740]  on ABC News.
[2:53:32.740 --> 2:53:34.740]  Oh, good media.
[2:53:34.740 --> 2:53:36.740]  Trump leaves the Kurds.
[2:53:36.740 --> 2:53:38.740]  Go ahead.
[2:53:38.740 --> 2:53:40.740]  Oh, yeah, I was actually calling.
[2:53:40.740 --> 2:53:42.740]  That was crazy about that,
[2:53:42.740 --> 2:53:44.740]  because I'm not too far from that gun range
[2:53:44.740 --> 2:53:46.740]  that they supposedly...
[2:53:46.740 --> 2:53:48.740]  the Kurds or whatever bombed.
[2:53:48.740 --> 2:53:50.740]  But I had a question regarding...
[2:53:52.740 --> 2:53:54.740]  the guy who infiltrated CNN.
[2:53:54.740 --> 2:53:56.740]  I was just wondering,
[2:53:56.740 --> 2:53:58.740]  it seems like Hillary Clinton always uses
[2:53:58.740 --> 2:54:00.740]  the Russian excuse
[2:54:00.740 --> 2:54:02.740]  or I guess anything she doesn't have a real excuse for.
[2:54:02.740 --> 2:54:04.740]  So I was just wondering if you had
[2:54:04.740 --> 2:54:06.740] ...
[2:54:06.740 --> 2:54:08.740]  Can we have to go to a re-education time?
[2:54:08.740 --> 2:54:10.740]  Sorry, go ahead, Gary.
[2:54:10.740 --> 2:54:12.740]  I'm sorry, can you repeat your question, sir?
[2:54:12.740 --> 2:54:14.740]  I was trying to relate that
[2:54:14.740 --> 2:54:16.740]  about Tulsi
[2:54:16.740 --> 2:54:18.740]  or about Hillary Clinton saying that Tulsi
[2:54:18.740 --> 2:54:20.740]  is a Russian agent,
[2:54:20.740 --> 2:54:22.740]  and it seems like there's a pattern there
[2:54:22.740 --> 2:54:24.740]  that Hillary Clinton always says the same thing
[2:54:24.740 --> 2:54:26.740]  about
[2:54:26.740 --> 2:54:28.740]  somebody that
[2:54:28.740 --> 2:54:30.740]  she does has no control over.
[2:54:30.740 --> 2:54:32.740]  It seems like...
[2:54:32.740 --> 2:54:34.740]  The racism thing doesn't work anymore
[2:54:34.740 --> 2:54:36.740]  and the made-up anti-Semitism,
[2:54:36.740 --> 2:54:38.740]  there could be bad weather.
[2:54:38.740 --> 2:54:40.740]  You don't like the weather or anti-Semitic?
[2:54:40.740 --> 2:54:42.740]  Why do you think she goes to this Russia thing
[2:54:42.740 --> 2:54:44.740]  over and over again?
[2:54:44.740 --> 2:54:46.740]  It's what she knows, and again, I can only speak
[2:54:46.740 --> 2:54:48.740]  from my personal experience,
[2:54:48.740 --> 2:54:50.740]  but it's a meme
[2:54:50.740 --> 2:54:52.740]  where everyone I don't like
[2:54:52.740 --> 2:54:54.740]  or agree with is either a Nazi, a Russian,
[2:54:54.740 --> 2:54:56.740]  a xenophobe, a transphobe or whatever.
[2:54:56.740 --> 2:54:58.740]  It's like a...
[2:54:58.740 --> 2:55:00.740]  I use these terms all the time when I was a leftist.
[2:55:00.740 --> 2:55:02.740]  It's like, okay, differing opinion,
[2:55:02.740 --> 2:55:04.740]  racist, bigot.
[2:55:04.740 --> 2:55:06.740]  Well, it's a way to bully people because my daughters
[2:55:06.740 --> 2:55:08.740]  are getting older, so they're around people,
[2:55:08.740 --> 2:55:10.740]  and I've been to these parties and events,
[2:55:10.740 --> 2:55:12.740]  and I'm not against goth girls.
[2:55:12.740 --> 2:55:14.740]  I dated a lot of them,
[2:55:14.740 --> 2:55:16.740]  but these aren't yesterday's goth girls.
[2:55:16.740 --> 2:55:18.740]  You'll be like at a middle school
[2:55:18.740 --> 2:55:20.740]  or high school deal, and girls pop in and go,
[2:55:20.740 --> 2:55:22.740]  we're lesbians, do you hate us?
[2:55:22.740 --> 2:55:24.740]  People will go, uh...
[2:55:24.740 --> 2:55:26.740]  And it's literally this way to bully everyone,
[2:55:26.740 --> 2:55:28.740]  and they brainwashed kids
[2:55:28.740 --> 2:55:30.740]  I mean, I'm talking like middle schools are now like...
[2:55:30.740 --> 2:55:32.740]  I mean, it is just like...
[2:55:32.740 --> 2:55:34.740]  You're not wearing your rainbow bracelet.
[2:55:34.740 --> 2:55:36.740]  Are you against me?
[2:55:36.740 --> 2:55:38.740]  Your 11-year-old daughter's like, what the hell are you talking about?
[2:55:38.740 --> 2:55:40.740]  I just want to go play with dolls or trucks or whatever.
[2:55:40.740 --> 2:55:42.740]  Exactly.
[2:55:42.740 --> 2:55:44.740]  My child that we're going to have,
[2:55:44.740 --> 2:55:46.740]  you know, she and I are just kind of...
[2:55:46.740 --> 2:55:48.740]  She? No, my...
[2:55:48.740 --> 2:55:50.740]  You're going to surmise the sex of your wife?
[2:55:50.740 --> 2:55:52.740]  How dare I, right?
[2:55:52.740 --> 2:55:54.740]  Arrest him under California law?
[2:55:54.740 --> 2:55:56.740]  Sorry.
[2:55:56.740 --> 2:55:58.740]  You know, this is our first child,
[2:55:58.740 --> 2:56:00.740]  and it's one of the things we're kind of scared of,
[2:56:00.740 --> 2:56:02.740]  like how we're going to like equip
[2:56:02.740 --> 2:56:04.740]  our child with tattoo
[2:56:04.740 --> 2:56:06.740]  into this new environment that is crazy
[2:56:06.740 --> 2:56:08.740]  even from my point of view as a...
[2:56:08.740 --> 2:56:10.740]  That's a great point. Let me ask you a serious question.
[2:56:10.740 --> 2:56:12.740]  What sex do you think fentanyl is?
[2:56:12.740 --> 2:56:14.740]  Well, the other thing here on Hillary on Russia,
[2:56:14.740 --> 2:56:16.740]  going to the college's question,
[2:56:16.740 --> 2:56:18.740]  is she grew up in the Cold War era.
[2:56:18.740 --> 2:56:20.740]  So she remembers that all you had to do
[2:56:20.740 --> 2:56:22.740]  to get rid of any kind of
[2:56:22.740 --> 2:56:24.740]  politically dissenting group...
[2:56:24.740 --> 2:56:26.740]  to say Russia or communism.
[2:56:26.740 --> 2:56:28.740]  So you could do that from 1945,
[2:56:28.740 --> 2:56:30.740]  really from 1935 to 1990.
[2:56:30.740 --> 2:56:32.740]  And it really is a Republican,
[2:56:32.740 --> 2:56:34.740]  old-fashioned Republican playbook.
[2:56:34.740 --> 2:56:36.740]  Right. And that's where she grew up.
[2:56:36.740 --> 2:56:38.740]  People forget she's a Goldwater girl.
[2:56:38.740 --> 2:56:40.740]  She grew up in that culture.
[2:56:40.740 --> 2:56:42.740]  So she knew, okay, if I'm in trouble
[2:56:42.740 --> 2:56:44.740]  and somebody is causing me trouble
[2:56:44.740 --> 2:56:46.740]  and exposing something problematic,
[2:56:46.740 --> 2:56:48.740]  just call them Russian.
[2:56:48.740 --> 2:56:50.740]  And that will get me out of all my problems.
[2:56:50.740 --> 2:56:52.740]  I'm sorry, but the Russians, not the people,
[2:56:52.740 --> 2:56:54.740]  are the ones running our business.
[2:56:54.740 --> 2:56:56.740]  I didn't hear the Russians telling us
[2:56:56.740 --> 2:56:58.740]  that the NBA can't support Hong Kong.
[2:56:58.740 --> 2:57:00.740]  Because if the Russians did that,
[2:57:00.740 --> 2:57:02.740]  I'd tell them, go to hell.
[2:57:02.740 --> 2:57:04.740]  The Russians are not a threat.
[2:57:04.740 --> 2:57:06.740]  They don't like Putin in particular
[2:57:06.740 --> 2:57:08.740]  because Putin is anti the sort of
[2:57:08.740 --> 2:57:10.740]  EU-established order of things.
[2:57:10.740 --> 2:57:12.740]  They can't push Putin around.
[2:57:12.740 --> 2:57:14.740]  Exactly. The same reason why they hate Trump
[2:57:14.740 --> 2:57:16.740]  is the reason why they hate Putin.
[2:57:16.740 --> 2:57:18.740]  Putin is not a threat to the United States.
[2:57:18.740 --> 2:57:20.740]  He could be a great ally to the United States
[2:57:20.740 --> 2:57:22.740]  and we're pushing Russia.
[2:57:22.740 --> 2:57:24.740]  You're very honest, the war against Islam.
[2:57:24.740 --> 2:57:26.740]  That's what it is. It's a war against the politicization
[2:57:26.740 --> 2:57:28.740]  of Islamic radicalization
[2:57:28.740 --> 2:57:30.740]  that's taking place that threatens Russia
[2:57:30.740 --> 2:57:32.740]  as much as it does any other country.
[2:57:32.740 --> 2:57:34.740]  The globalists are definitely using Russia
[2:57:34.740 --> 2:57:36.740]  as their takeover tool.
[2:57:36.740 --> 2:57:38.740]  Not Russia, the Islamists.
[2:57:38.740 --> 2:57:40.740]  How are they going to control the Islamists in the future?
[2:57:40.740 --> 2:57:42.740]  Exactly.
[2:57:42.740 --> 2:57:44.740]  You talk about playing with fire, folks.
[2:57:44.740 --> 2:57:46.740]  No doubt about it.
[2:57:46.740 --> 2:57:48.740]  We need to get fentanyl and Islamic buddy.
[2:57:48.740 --> 2:57:50.740]  Oh, hello, jihadi.
[2:57:50.740 --> 2:57:52.740]  We're right back.
[2:57:52.740 --> 2:57:54.740]  It is now an admitted fact.
[2:57:54.740 --> 2:57:56.740]  Fluoride out of the water
[2:57:56.740 --> 2:57:58.740]  has caused tens of millions of Americans
[2:57:58.740 --> 2:58:00.740]  to be brain damaged
[2:58:00.740 --> 2:58:02.740]  and to have infertility and low IQs.
[2:58:02.740 --> 2:58:04.740]  And it doesn't matter if the Journal
[2:58:04.740 --> 2:58:06.740]  of American Medical Association comes out
[2:58:06.740 --> 2:58:08.740]  and says it's terrible, still the city's
[2:58:08.740 --> 2:58:10.740]  put it in the water because the ruling globalists
[2:58:10.740 --> 2:58:12.740]  want you and your family poisoned and stupid.
[2:58:12.740 --> 2:58:14.740]  And they sure don't want you to know about
[2:58:14.740 --> 2:58:16.740]  the good allergen iodine
[2:58:16.740 --> 2:58:18.740]  that absolutely increases
[2:58:18.740 --> 2:58:20.740]  IQ and fertility
[2:58:20.740 --> 2:58:22.740]  and makes life so wonderful
[2:58:22.740 --> 2:58:24.740]  and opens up your consciousness, your mind, everything.
[2:58:24.740 --> 2:58:26.740]  Thank God.
[2:58:26.740 --> 2:58:28.740]  Thank God. I discovered this eight years ago.
[2:58:28.740 --> 2:58:30.740]  Of course, the enemy knows all about it
[2:58:30.740 --> 2:58:32.740]  and they hope you don't discover it.
[2:58:32.740 --> 2:58:34.740]  They hope you just roll over and die.
[2:58:34.740 --> 2:58:36.740]  So whatever you do, don't visit
[2:58:36.740 --> 2:58:38.740]  infowarstore.com and get 60% off right now

[2:58:42.740 --> 2:58:44.740]  with X2 and X3 together with your bottle
[2:58:44.740 --> 2:58:46.740]  of Biotrusillinium, whatever you do,
[2:58:46.740 --> 2:58:48.740]  don't go to infowarstore.com. Just give up America.
[2:58:48.740 --> 2:58:50.740]  Give up Christians.
[2:58:50.740 --> 2:58:52.740]  Drink your fluoride and die!
[2:58:52.740 --> 2:58:54.740]  Give in to Satan! Give in!
[2:58:54.740 --> 2:58:56.740]  Again, I'm not
[2:58:56.740 --> 2:58:58.740]  talking down to the info wars audience
[2:58:58.740 --> 2:59:00.740]  but I've been banging my head
[2:59:00.740 --> 2:59:02.740]  against a wall for a long time on this
[2:59:02.740 --> 2:59:04.740]  and I'm talking about fluoride
[2:59:04.740 --> 2:59:06.740]  and I'm talking about iodine.
[2:59:06.740 --> 2:59:08.740]  Now, if you have a boat, a motor boat,
[2:59:08.740 --> 2:59:10.740]  let's say an old glass tron boat
[2:59:10.740 --> 2:59:12.740]  and you want to take it on the lake
[2:59:12.740 --> 2:59:14.740]  you've got to have a lake
[2:59:14.740 --> 2:59:16.740]  to put it in.
[2:59:16.740 --> 2:59:18.740]  If you're a human being, you've got to have oxygen
[2:59:18.740 --> 2:59:20.740]  to live. Okay, it's the same thing.
[2:59:20.740 --> 2:59:22.740]  Well, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:59:22.740 --> 2:59:24.740]  the bad halogen is fluoride.
[2:59:24.740 --> 2:59:26.740]  That's why in every western nation
[2:59:26.740 --> 2:59:28.740]  they put it in the water. They're going to teach us Christians
[2:59:28.740 --> 2:59:30.740]  to lay down and die. The chai comms
[2:59:30.740 --> 2:59:32.740]  don't put it in the water. They'd execute you if you did that.
[2:59:32.740 --> 2:59:34.740]  They put iodine in the water
[2:59:34.740 --> 2:59:36.740]  because it's the good halogen
[2:59:36.740 --> 2:59:38.740]  and increases fertility and lifespan
[2:59:38.740 --> 2:59:40.740]  and intelligence and everything else.
[2:59:40.740 --> 2:59:42.740]  So again, learn about the iodine conspiracy
[2:59:42.740 --> 2:59:44.740]  at infoorstore.com
[2:59:44.740 --> 2:59:46.740]  We have all the documents and articles linked
[2:59:46.740 --> 2:59:48.740]  and then get good iodine for yourself
[2:59:48.740 --> 2:59:50.740]  because the globalists are fighting to make sure you don't.
[2:59:50.740 --> 2:59:52.740]  Again, get iodine
[2:59:52.740 --> 3:00:12.740]  at infoorstore.com
[3:00:12.740 --> 3:00:14.740]  It's great having Barnes here with us as well.
[3:00:14.740 --> 3:00:16.740]  He is just always interesting to listen to.
[3:00:16.740 --> 3:00:18.740]  I'm not hyping stuff up.
[3:00:18.740 --> 3:00:20.740]  We got a really big
[3:00:20.740 --> 3:00:22.740]  announcement tomorrow
[3:00:22.740 --> 3:00:24.740]  about problems Trump faces
[3:00:24.740 --> 3:00:26.740]  and this could really help Trump.
[3:00:26.740 --> 3:00:28.740]  I may just come back in this afternoon and cover it's dangerous stuff.
[3:00:28.740 --> 3:00:30.740]  And then I got a special guest Friday
[3:00:30.740 --> 3:00:32.740]  you're not going to want to miss. I'm just going to leave it at that.
[3:00:32.740 --> 3:00:34.740]  It's going to be big.
[3:00:34.740 --> 3:00:36.740]  Let's take some more phone calls and then Barnes is going to move over
[3:00:36.740 --> 3:00:38.740]  into this seat and Kerry's having fun
[3:00:38.740 --> 3:00:40.740]  so he's going to stay as long as he wants in this hour.
[3:00:40.740 --> 3:00:42.740]  He can take a break towards the end of the hour
[3:00:42.740 --> 3:00:44.740]  and he's doing some of the war room with Owen Schroeder today
[3:00:44.740 --> 3:00:46.740]  all of them at band.videoinfoorstore.com
[3:00:46.740 --> 3:00:48.740]  for his last show and we really appreciate the listeners.
[3:00:48.740 --> 3:00:50.740]  Let's go ahead and go to Carlos and Canada.
[3:00:50.740 --> 3:00:52.740]  Carlos, go ahead. You're on the air with Robert Barnes
[3:00:52.740 --> 3:00:54.740]  and Steven Whistleblower.
[3:00:54.740 --> 3:00:56.740]  Go ahead.
[3:00:56.740 --> 3:00:58.740]  Thank you, Alex.
[3:00:58.740 --> 3:01:00.740]  During the 2016 presidential campaign
[3:01:00.740 --> 3:01:02.740]  it was shown clearly
[3:01:02.740 --> 3:01:04.740]  that CNN
[3:01:04.740 --> 3:01:06.740]  in a deliberate effort to deceive the American people
[3:01:06.740 --> 3:01:08.740]  increased pictures
[3:01:08.740 --> 3:01:10.740]  or showed pictures, doctor pictures
[3:01:10.740 --> 3:01:12.740]  of
[3:01:12.740 --> 3:01:14.740]  higher attendance at Hillary Clinton's rallies
[3:01:14.740 --> 3:01:16.740]  that clearly
[3:01:16.740 --> 3:01:18.740]  showed they were doctors.
[3:01:18.740 --> 3:01:20.740]  And then a lot about Trump and his inauguration.
[3:01:20.740 --> 3:01:22.740]  Sorry, go ahead.
[3:01:22.740 --> 3:01:24.740]  That's right.
[3:01:24.740 --> 3:01:26.740]  My question is simple.
[3:01:26.740 --> 3:01:28.740]  Were you aware of this manipulation
[3:01:28.740 --> 3:01:30.740]  and you saw how do we address it
[3:01:30.740 --> 3:01:32.740]  because it's certainly going to be done again
[3:01:32.740 --> 3:01:34.740]  unless we blow it out of the water?
[3:01:34.740 --> 3:01:36.740]  I was not aware at the time
[3:01:36.740 --> 3:01:38.740]  that I worked at CNN.
[3:01:38.740 --> 3:01:40.740]  Actually, hold on, no.
[3:01:40.740 --> 3:01:42.740]  Actually, I do remember seeing those reports
[3:01:42.740 --> 3:01:44.740]  because remember I was campaigning for Bernie
[3:01:44.740 --> 3:01:46.740]  in the disinformation warfare
[3:01:46.740 --> 3:01:48.740]  seeing where they would have
[3:01:48.740 --> 3:01:50.740]  a cross-section of
[3:01:50.740 --> 3:01:52.740]  crowds just
[3:01:52.740 --> 3:01:54.740]  overlapping each other where you could see the same like...
[3:01:54.740 --> 3:01:56.740]  But he wasn't at CNN yet.
[3:01:56.740 --> 3:01:58.740]  You came after the election.
[3:01:58.740 --> 3:02:00.740]  I was aware of all that stuff
[3:02:00.740 --> 3:02:02.740]  that not only CNN but the other groups
[3:02:02.740 --> 3:02:04.740]  were doing as well trying to make
[3:02:04.740 --> 3:02:06.740]  Hillary's rallies
[3:02:06.740 --> 3:02:08.740]  appear bigger, appear popular.
[3:02:08.740 --> 3:02:10.740]  Remember the polling where it said
[3:02:10.740 --> 3:02:12.740]  Hillary was beating Bernie by landslides
[3:02:12.740 --> 3:02:14.740]  but only with the superdelegates
[3:02:14.740 --> 3:02:16.740]  but that's another rabbit hole to go.
[3:02:16.740 --> 3:02:18.740]  They totally stole them on record
[3:02:18.740 --> 3:02:20.740]  but Carlos raises a good point.
[3:02:20.740 --> 3:02:22.740]  I forgot about that.
[3:02:22.740 --> 3:02:24.740]  Now they photoshopped the stuff in.
[3:02:24.740 --> 3:02:26.740]  How do you keep track of all these lies?
[3:02:26.740 --> 3:02:28.740]  Because it's so systemic and systematic.
[3:02:28.740 --> 3:02:30.740]  For example, today CNN has a pullout
[3:02:30.740 --> 3:02:32.740]  and they bury the lead
[3:02:32.740 --> 3:02:34.740]  which is for the first time
[3:02:34.740 --> 3:02:36.740]  in two years
[3:02:36.740 --> 3:02:38.740]  Republican and Trump supporters
[3:02:38.740 --> 3:02:40.740]  are much more excited about voting
[3:02:40.740 --> 3:02:42.740]  in the election than Trump critics and Democrats.
[3:02:42.740 --> 3:02:44.740]  In fact, by a large margin.
[3:02:44.740 --> 3:02:46.740]  I mean, look at his rallies.
[3:02:46.740 --> 3:02:48.740]  They turned away $30,000 in Dallas. I was there.
[3:02:48.740 --> 3:02:50.740]  It's another example of material omission.
[3:02:50.740 --> 3:02:52.740]  So here you have a CNN poll that has favorable information
[3:02:52.740 --> 3:02:54.740]  for Trump, very favorable information
[3:02:54.740 --> 3:02:56.740]  because those people who said impeachment would be
[3:02:56.740 --> 3:02:58.740]  a political disaster for Democrats
[3:02:58.740 --> 3:03:00.740]  is that it would reawaken
[3:03:00.740 --> 3:03:02.740]  a sleeping Trump base that had
[3:03:02.740 --> 3:03:04.740]  a portion of which had gone a little bit to sleep
[3:03:04.740 --> 3:03:06.740]  over the last two years and they are now awake.
[3:03:06.740 --> 3:03:08.740]  But it's amazing. The degrees of deception
[3:03:08.740 --> 3:03:10.740]  and dishonesty are just continuous.
[3:03:10.740 --> 3:03:12.740]  I mean, they continue to do it to Bernie. They hate Bernie
[3:03:12.740 --> 3:03:14.740]  because Bernie's an honest commie.
[3:03:14.740 --> 3:03:16.740]  It's okay to be, you know, the...
[3:03:16.740 --> 3:03:18.740]  No worries at. Yeah, exactly.
[3:03:18.740 --> 3:03:20.740]  And he's at least anti-establishment.
[3:03:20.740 --> 3:03:22.740]  And he has a history of taking contrarian positions
[3:03:22.740 --> 3:03:24.740]  on immigration and gun control.
[3:03:24.740 --> 3:03:26.740]  Now he's abandoned those positions today.
[3:03:26.740 --> 3:03:28.740]  Absolutely. I want Carlos to get a final point
[3:03:28.740 --> 3:03:30.740]  that I'm going to let you guys take over
[3:03:30.740 --> 3:03:32.740]  and you can get to these calls as well if you'd like.
[3:03:32.740 --> 3:03:34.740]  I'm sure you will.
[3:03:34.740 --> 3:03:36.740]  But let me just ask this question to both of you
[3:03:36.740 --> 3:03:38.740]  but how are they planning,
[3:03:38.740 --> 3:03:40.740]  because you're really the expert on this, Barnes,
[3:03:40.740 --> 3:03:42.740]  how are they planning when this AG report
[3:03:42.740 --> 3:03:44.740]  comes out that Grassley now says
[3:03:44.740 --> 3:03:46.740]  maybe a whitewash he warned yesterday,
[3:03:46.740 --> 3:03:48.740]  how are they going to square it up
[3:03:48.740 --> 3:03:50.740]  when this latest person, again,
[3:03:50.740 --> 3:03:52.740]  just said he heard people say this
[3:03:52.740 --> 3:03:54.740]  and then you go to the actual transcripts or witnesses,
[3:03:54.740 --> 3:03:56.740]  Trump didn't say it, and the EU ambassador
[3:03:56.740 --> 3:03:58.740]  admonished Bill Taylor,
[3:03:58.740 --> 3:04:00.740]  the US Ukrainian ambassador, and said,
[3:04:00.740 --> 3:04:02.740]  that's not true. Don't do that.
[3:04:02.740 --> 3:04:04.740]  So it's just that should backfire
[3:04:04.740 --> 3:04:06.740]  and there's a movement ring on them.
[3:04:06.740 --> 3:04:08.740]  If you've been caught lying over and over again,
[3:04:08.740 --> 3:04:10.740]  how do you then keep, you know,
[3:04:10.740 --> 3:04:12.740]  continuing to put new lies out for old,
[3:04:12.740 --> 3:04:14.740]  but they really are building the consensus
[3:04:14.740 --> 3:04:16.740]  to take Trump out.
[3:04:16.740 --> 3:04:18.740]  Trump had to go up to Lindsey Graham to make him come out
[3:04:18.740 --> 3:04:20.740]  and say, you know, we should excoriate
[3:04:20.740 --> 3:04:22.740]  and have a resolution against the House
[3:04:22.740 --> 3:04:24.740]  and what Democrats are doing.
[3:04:24.740 --> 3:04:26.740]  I mean, I get it's energized Trump's base
[3:04:26.740 --> 3:04:28.740]  and Trump seems confident by that and that's good.
[3:04:28.740 --> 3:04:30.740]  But if we get too confident,
[3:04:30.740 --> 3:04:32.740]  they're moving against Trump
[3:04:32.740 --> 3:04:34.740]  and I think at a gut level
[3:04:34.740 --> 3:04:36.740]  and you can see it in their action,
[3:04:36.740 --> 3:04:38.740]  even though it's crazy and reckless.
[3:04:38.740 --> 3:04:40.740]  So how will they do it? A,
[3:04:40.740 --> 3:04:42.740]  B, if they're successful, what do you both think happens?
[3:04:42.740 --> 3:04:44.740]  We'll be back in 60 seconds.
[3:04:44.740 --> 3:04:46.740]  Carlos, thank you, great points.
[3:04:46.740 --> 3:04:48.740]  And Johnny, Ryan, Michael, Chris, these guys will get to you as well.
[3:04:48.740 --> 3:04:50.740]  So co-hosting Robert Barnes
[3:04:50.740 --> 3:04:52.740]  with Cary Portz, the CNN whistleblower
[3:04:52.740 --> 3:04:54.740]  in only eight days, nine days.
[3:04:54.740 --> 3:04:56.740]  Look at where he's come from, that dropping
[3:04:56.740 --> 3:04:58.740]  to now in info wars.
[3:04:58.740 --> 3:05:00.740]  He's going to hell fast, didn't he, according to CNN?
[3:05:00.740 --> 3:05:02.740]  He's going to hell.
[3:05:02.740 --> 3:05:04.740]  Welcome back to NPR here today.
[3:05:04.740 --> 3:05:06.740]  I'm Wilbur Snakely
[3:05:06.740 --> 3:05:08.740]  and I just want you to know
[3:05:08.740 --> 3:05:10.740]  that when you hear the intro of the show
[3:05:10.740 --> 3:05:12.740]  and it's the Rockefeller Foundation
[3:05:12.740 --> 3:05:14.740]  and the Carnegie Foundation,
[3:05:14.740 --> 3:05:16.740]  don't look into the 1920s and 30s documents
[3:05:16.740 --> 3:05:18.740]  where they said that
[3:05:18.740 --> 3:05:20.740]  to be free from war,
[3:05:20.740 --> 3:05:22.740]  we must end the family and masculinity
[3:05:22.740 --> 3:05:24.740]  and that we must put chemicals
[3:05:24.740 --> 3:05:26.740]  in the food and water
[3:05:26.740 --> 3:05:28.740]  to make the men subservient
[3:05:28.740 --> 3:05:30.740]  and fertile.
[3:05:30.740 --> 3:05:32.740]  A real terrorist, Alex Jones,
[3:05:32.740 --> 3:05:34.740]  has been on air with that gravelly
[3:05:34.740 --> 3:05:36.740]  evil male voice
[3:05:36.740 --> 3:05:38.740]  telling you to look into how iodine's
[3:05:38.740 --> 3:05:40.740]  good for your body and essential
[3:05:40.740 --> 3:05:42.740]  and how fluoride's bad.
[3:05:42.740 --> 3:05:44.740]  Listen, that's a conspiracy theory, okay?
[3:05:44.740 --> 3:05:46.740]  There's no medical journals.
[3:05:46.740 --> 3:05:48.740]  There's no facts.
[3:05:48.740 --> 3:05:50.740]  You need fluoride. Just drink
[3:05:50.740 --> 3:05:52.740]  extra fluoride
[3:05:52.740 --> 3:05:54.740]  and then you don't have to think anymore
[3:05:54.740 --> 3:05:56.740]  and just go to sleep
[3:05:56.740 --> 3:05:58.740]  when I talk to you real soft like this.
[3:06:26.740 --> 3:06:28.740]  There are challenges
[3:06:28.740 --> 3:06:30.740]  in our individual lives
[3:06:30.740 --> 3:06:32.740]  and to our species in general.
[3:06:32.740 --> 3:06:34.740]  It's fulfilling to face
[3:06:34.740 --> 3:06:36.740]  the hard facts because
[3:06:36.740 --> 3:06:38.740]  we are designed
[3:06:38.740 --> 3:06:40.740]  to take on a challenge
[3:06:40.740 --> 3:06:42.740]  when we decide to actually engage
[3:06:42.740 --> 3:06:44.740]  and be involved and have purpose-driven lives.
[3:06:44.740 --> 3:06:46.740]  So many people are completely
[3:06:46.740 --> 3:06:48.740]  empty no matter how much money
[3:06:48.740 --> 3:06:50.740]  or how much success they have
[3:06:50.740 --> 3:06:52.740]  because they did it only
[3:06:52.740 --> 3:06:54.740]  for themselves,
[3:06:54.740 --> 3:06:56.740]  connectivity.
[3:06:56.740 --> 3:06:58.740]  Now, the globalists understand this.
[3:06:58.740 --> 3:07:00.740]  The social engineers know how we take
[3:07:00.740 --> 3:07:02.740]  and so they will create
[3:07:02.740 --> 3:07:04.740]  an artificial system of collectivism
[3:07:04.740 --> 3:07:06.740]  where a centralized corporate board
[3:07:06.740 --> 3:07:08.740]  collectivizes us
[3:07:08.740 --> 3:07:10.740]  for the so-called good
[3:07:10.740 --> 3:07:12.740]  of the people.
[3:07:12.740 --> 3:07:14.740]  But really, we're being collectivized
[3:07:14.740 --> 3:07:16.740]  so we can be controlled and engineered
[3:07:16.740 --> 3:07:18.740]  and further dumbed down
[3:07:18.740 --> 3:07:20.740]  and turned into slaves. That's the admitted
[3:07:20.740 --> 3:07:22.740]  globalist program.
[3:07:22.740 --> 3:07:24.740]  I like to pull back
[3:07:24.740 --> 3:07:26.740]  and look at things that are really hard to change
[3:07:26.740 --> 3:07:28.740]  versus things that are really easy to change.
[3:07:28.740 --> 3:07:30.740]  And InfoWars has been instrumental
[3:07:30.740 --> 3:07:32.740]  thanks to your support in launching
[3:07:32.740 --> 3:07:34.740]  major initiatives against
[3:07:34.740 --> 3:07:36.740]  the anti-human forces
[3:07:36.740 --> 3:07:38.740]  of the NWO.
[3:07:38.740 --> 3:07:40.740]  That said though,
[3:07:40.740 --> 3:07:42.740]  electromagnetic radiation from 5G,
[3:07:42.740 --> 3:07:44.740]  what they're
[3:07:44.740 --> 3:07:46.740]  doing to us through the vaccines,
[3:07:46.740 --> 3:07:48.740]  all of this is a real challenge.
[3:07:48.740 --> 3:07:50.740]  The brainwashing of our children,
[3:07:50.740 --> 3:07:52.740]  the cessation of our children,
[3:07:52.740 --> 3:07:54.740]  all of this is done to sabotage
[3:07:54.740 --> 3:07:56.740]  the species so we don't go to the next level.
[3:07:56.740 --> 3:07:58.740]  But one of the ways we can
[3:07:58.740 --> 3:08:00.740]  really, really take action
[3:08:00.740 --> 3:08:02.740]  is with
[3:08:02.740 --> 3:08:04.740]  things that our bodies absolutely
[3:08:04.740 --> 3:08:06.740]  have to have to live and survive.
[3:08:06.740 --> 3:08:08.740]  And these are things that the globalists
[3:08:08.740 --> 3:08:10.740]  have very quietly,
[3:08:10.740 --> 3:08:12.740]  but in a steady way, focused on
[3:08:12.740 --> 3:08:14.740]  to make sure that we don't
[3:08:14.740 --> 3:08:16.740]  get them in our diets so that we are
[3:08:16.740 --> 3:08:18.740]  dumb, so that we are slow,
[3:08:18.740 --> 3:08:20.740]  so that we are lethargic,
[3:08:20.740 --> 3:08:22.740]  so that we don't have that initiative.
[3:08:22.740 --> 3:08:24.740]  Because if we have the initiative,
[3:08:24.740 --> 3:08:26.740]  well then we will make choices
[3:08:26.740 --> 3:08:28.740]  in our lives and be involved in ways
[3:08:28.740 --> 3:08:30.740]  that take control away
[3:08:30.740 --> 3:08:32.740]  from the control freak social engineer,
[3:08:32.740 --> 3:08:34.740]  globalists, the mad scientists
[3:08:34.740 --> 3:08:36.740]  that think they're God.
[3:08:36.740 --> 3:08:38.740]  Now that said,
[3:08:38.740 --> 3:08:40.740]  this is how we fund our operation.
[3:08:40.740 --> 3:08:42.740]  And I fund our operation with things that
[3:08:42.740 --> 3:08:44.740]  I believe in, that I know we're good,
[3:08:44.740 --> 3:08:46.740]  and that I use.
[3:08:46.740 --> 3:08:48.740]  I can't tell you enough
[3:08:48.740 --> 3:08:50.740]  how important it is to realize
[3:08:50.740 --> 3:08:52.740]  that almost all the soils on the planet
[3:08:52.740 --> 3:08:54.740]  are depleted of iodine.
[3:08:54.740 --> 3:08:56.740]  If you don't have iodine,
[3:08:56.740 --> 3:08:58.740]  you will get deficiencies, you will end up dying.
[3:08:58.740 --> 3:09:00.740]  That's a fact. And there's all the big studies,
[3:09:00.740 --> 3:09:02.740]  Europe, your US, China, Mexico,
[3:09:02.740 --> 3:09:04.740]  there's thousands of them, that
[3:09:04.740 --> 3:09:06.740]  iodine deficiency causes
[3:09:06.740 --> 3:09:08.740]  autism-like symptoms, it causes
[3:09:08.740 --> 3:09:10.740]  birth defects, it causes
[3:09:10.740 --> 3:09:12.740]  so many serious problems, very low IQs
[3:09:12.740 --> 3:09:14.740]  of children. And if you add fluoride
[3:09:14.740 --> 3:09:16.740]  to that, which Western governments add to the water,
[3:09:16.740 --> 3:09:18.740]  and to foods, then
[3:09:18.740 --> 3:09:20.740]  it accelerates that. And our life expectancy
[3:09:20.740 --> 3:09:22.740]  is going down in the West,
[3:09:22.740 --> 3:09:24.740]  infant mortality is exploding,
[3:09:24.740 --> 3:09:26.740]  we are getting stupider
[3:09:26.740 --> 3:09:28.740]  and stupider, our IQs are plunging,
[3:09:28.740 --> 3:09:30.740]  and ladies and gentlemen, this is being done
[3:09:30.740 --> 3:09:32.740]  by the cold-blooded
[3:09:32.740 --> 3:09:34.740]  establishment to
[3:09:34.740 --> 3:09:36.740]  create a system where the West falls
[3:09:36.740 --> 3:09:38.740]  and then there'll be nobody to oppose
[3:09:38.740 --> 3:09:40.740]  their authoritarianism because all the other nations
[3:09:40.740 --> 3:09:42.740]  accept it. They never had the revolution
[3:09:42.740 --> 3:09:44.740]  that we had in America, in areas of England
[3:09:44.740 --> 3:09:46.740]  and Europe. And so it's a big deal.
[3:09:46.740 --> 3:09:48.740]  So I want to just encourage you to understand
[3:09:48.740 --> 3:09:50.740]  this isn't just some pitch to find M4s.
[3:09:50.740 --> 3:09:52.740]  We have the
[3:09:52.740 --> 3:09:54.740]  iodine challenge at m4store.com
[3:09:54.740 --> 3:09:56.740]  X2 and X3, and
[3:09:56.740 --> 3:09:58.740]  Biotrusilinium, the very best
[3:09:58.740 --> 3:10:00.740]  out there, it goes very well with the iodine.
[3:10:00.740 --> 3:10:02.740]  To supercharge the electrochemical
[3:10:02.740 --> 3:10:04.740]  activities in your body, your body
[3:10:04.740 --> 3:10:06.740]  makes hormones off of iodine, it's just
[3:10:06.740 --> 3:10:08.740]  incredible. And find out what the good halogen
[3:10:08.740 --> 3:10:10.740]  does versus the bad halogen.
[3:10:10.740 --> 3:10:12.740]  Go to m4store.com
[3:10:12.740 --> 3:10:14.740]  60% off on the iodine global challenge
[3:10:14.740 --> 3:10:16.740]  and please tell others about this information
[3:10:16.740 --> 3:10:18.740]  and give them the facts because this
[3:10:18.740 --> 3:10:20.740]  is key to stopping the globalist agenda.
[3:10:26.740 --> 3:10:28.740]  Alright, back with the Alex Jones show
[3:10:28.740 --> 3:10:30.740]  with the CNN whistleblower and we got
[3:10:30.740 --> 3:10:32.740]  some phone calls to answer. Let's go to
[3:10:32.740 --> 3:10:34.740]  Chris
[3:10:34.740 --> 3:10:40.740]  in Washington.
[3:10:40.740 --> 3:10:42.740]  How are you doing? Hello? Hey, we're good.
[3:10:42.740 --> 3:10:44.740]  You're on, Chris. Go ahead.
[3:10:44.740 --> 3:10:46.740]  Alright, thanks.
[3:10:46.740 --> 3:10:48.740]  You know, I just wanted to say that
[3:10:48.740 --> 3:10:50.740]  Kerry, you're very heroic and
[3:10:50.740 --> 3:10:52.740]  as a patriot and
[3:10:52.740 --> 3:10:54.740]  I really appreciate what you did
[3:10:54.740 --> 3:10:56.740]  and you were talking about
[3:10:56.740 --> 3:10:58.740]  the grains of sand.
[3:10:58.740 --> 3:11:00.740]  I'm a single father, daughter of 12
[3:11:00.740 --> 3:11:02.740]  and my biggest
[3:11:02.740 --> 3:11:04.740]  concern is her future. Me,
[3:11:04.740 --> 3:11:06.740]  I'm at the age where it really doesn't matter
[3:11:06.740 --> 3:11:08.740]  for me so much anymore.
[3:11:08.740 --> 3:11:10.740]  Do you think that having
[3:11:10.740 --> 3:11:12.740]  your newborn coming expecting
[3:11:12.740 --> 3:11:14.740]  a child helped
[3:11:14.740 --> 3:11:16.740]  you just help you over the edge
[3:11:16.740 --> 3:11:18.740]  to reach out to James O'Keefe?
[3:11:18.740 --> 3:11:20.740]  Just curious. Yeah, Chris,
[3:11:20.740 --> 3:11:22.740]  thanks so much for calling in and obviously thanks
[3:11:22.740 --> 3:11:24.740]  for your patience. I know a lot of people are patient to get on the show
[3:11:24.740 --> 3:11:26.740]  and I definitely appreciate that
[3:11:26.740 --> 3:11:28.740]  and your words. So, first of all,
[3:11:28.740 --> 3:11:30.740]  like all the messages
[3:11:30.740 --> 3:11:32.740]  and phone calls and texts
[3:11:32.740 --> 3:11:34.740]  and, you know, go fund me
[3:11:34.740 --> 3:11:36.740]  messages that got to me directly. I mean,
[3:11:36.740 --> 3:11:38.740]  it's all humbling and I'm just trying
[3:11:38.740 --> 3:11:40.740]  to do the right thing just like I'm sure you would have too, Chris.
[3:11:40.740 --> 3:11:42.740]  But to your question,
[3:11:42.740 --> 3:11:44.740]  I mean, I think us
[3:11:44.740 --> 3:11:46.740]  finding out that we were expecting a child
[3:11:46.740 --> 3:11:48.740]  to me, obviously at first, it was pretty scary.
[3:11:48.740 --> 3:11:50.740]  Just, you know, your father
[3:11:50.740 --> 3:11:52.740]  as well. But I think that kind of
[3:11:52.740 --> 3:11:54.740]  pushed me into overdrive where
[3:11:54.740 --> 3:11:56.740]  I'm like, I have to do this for
[3:11:56.740 --> 3:11:58.740]  not only the Republic but, you know,
[3:11:58.740 --> 3:12:00.740]  my selfish version of the Republic,
[3:12:00.740 --> 3:12:02.740]  you know, my own circle. So,
[3:12:02.740 --> 3:12:04.740]  because I just wanted my child to,
[3:12:04.740 --> 3:12:06.740]  you know, have a shot at a fair and free election, at least
[3:12:06.740 --> 3:12:08.740]  possibly the last one we might have.
[3:12:08.740 --> 3:12:10.740]  Hopefully this will just be the
[3:12:10.740 --> 3:12:12.740]  turning point or the match that lights the candle
[3:12:12.740 --> 3:12:14.740]  for an awakening. That's all we're trying to do.
[3:12:14.740 --> 3:12:16.740]  So, hopefully that answers your questions,
[3:12:16.740 --> 3:12:18.740]  but it definitely pumped it into overdrive
[3:12:18.740 --> 3:12:20.740]  for me and my fiance as well.
[3:12:22.740 --> 3:12:24.740]  Thanks, Chris. Let's go to Michael
[3:12:24.740 --> 3:12:26.740]  in Indiana.
[3:12:26.740 --> 3:12:28.740]  Hey, I was out. You've actually
[3:12:28.740 --> 3:12:30.740]  already answered my question. So, I was
[3:12:30.740 --> 3:12:32.740]  really just wanting to say thank you as a
[3:12:32.740 --> 3:12:34.740]  veteran also. I was in OES.
[3:12:34.740 --> 3:12:36.740]  We just couldn't.
[3:12:36.740 --> 3:12:38.740]  I've been praying for someone
[3:12:38.740 --> 3:12:40.740]  like you to come out and just God
[3:12:40.740 --> 3:12:42.740]  reveal this to you and let you see
[3:12:42.740 --> 3:12:44.740]  just like, I'm super glad Alex
[3:12:44.740 --> 3:12:46.740]  is pushing the iodine thing because
[3:12:46.740 --> 3:12:48.740]  that has been vital. That is like, I've
[3:12:48.740 --> 3:12:50.740]  opened up more people's eyes with
[3:12:50.740 --> 3:12:52.740]  what runs your gland. No one
[3:12:52.740 --> 3:12:54.740]  knows. It's halogen.
[3:12:54.740 --> 3:12:56.740]  If you take iodine, this will change
[3:12:56.740 --> 3:12:58.740]  your life, people. Thank you gentlemen
[3:12:58.740 --> 3:13:00.740]  so much. You have a wonderful day.
[3:13:00.740 --> 3:13:02.740]  Thanks, sir. You as well. Absolutely. Thank
[3:13:02.740 --> 3:13:04.740]  you, Michael. Let's go to Ryan
[3:13:04.740 --> 3:13:06.740]  in Missouri.
[3:13:06.740 --> 3:13:08.740]  Go ahead, Ryan.
[3:13:08.740 --> 3:13:10.740]  Hello.
[3:13:10.740 --> 3:13:12.740]  Yeah, you're on.
[3:13:12.740 --> 3:13:14.740]  Yeah, I had a remark about
[3:13:14.740 --> 3:13:16.740]  Kerry, something he had said earlier in the program
[3:13:16.740 --> 3:13:18.740]  about the social media spying.
[3:13:18.740 --> 3:13:20.740]  So, I had an experience
[3:13:20.740 --> 3:13:22.740]  about a week ago. My wife had bought
[3:13:22.740 --> 3:13:24.740]  something from the store, you know,
[3:13:24.740 --> 3:13:26.740]  Walmart, I suppose. It was food related.
[3:13:26.740 --> 3:13:28.740]  About 30 minutes later, after she
[3:13:28.740 --> 3:13:30.740]  got home, I had the exact same product
[3:13:30.740 --> 3:13:32.740]  on my Facebook as an ad.
[3:13:32.740 --> 3:13:34.740]  I have never bought that item. I had never bought
[3:13:34.740 --> 3:13:36.740]  that brand or anything like that.
[3:13:36.740 --> 3:13:38.740]  And yeah, I mean, I live here
[3:13:38.740 --> 3:13:40.740]  in southern Missouri in the middle of a cornfield.
[3:13:40.740 --> 3:13:42.740]  So, this stuff is reaching everybody, the spy gate.
[3:13:42.740 --> 3:13:44.740]  It's a really weird man.
[3:13:44.740 --> 3:13:46.740]  Oh, no doubt about it. I mean, the
[3:13:46.740 --> 3:13:48.740]  degree to which the institutional media
[3:13:48.740 --> 3:13:50.740]  services the interest of
[3:13:50.740 --> 3:13:52.740]  the institutional powers within the deep state
[3:13:52.740 --> 3:13:54.740]  is extraordinary. And we
[3:13:54.740 --> 3:13:56.740]  were just discussing a CNN article
[3:13:56.740 --> 3:13:58.740]  that's exceptionally misleading from today
[3:13:58.740 --> 3:14:00.740]  that says, dramatic deposition
[3:14:00.740 --> 3:14:02.740]  rocks Trump's impeachment defense.
[3:14:02.740 --> 3:14:04.740]  And aside from the fact that it didn't
[3:14:04.740 --> 3:14:06.740]  rock Trump's impeachment defense at all,
[3:14:06.740 --> 3:14:08.740]  the individual didn't have much relevant and pertinent
[3:14:08.740 --> 3:14:10.740]  testimony. But in addition,
[3:14:10.740 --> 3:14:12.740]  the way they use, they refer to Ukraine
[3:14:12.740 --> 3:14:14.740]  as quote, the former Soviet state.
[3:14:14.740 --> 3:14:16.740]  So, there's this constant efforts to
[3:14:16.740 --> 3:14:18.740]  demonize and
[3:14:18.740 --> 3:14:20.740]  to create this false impression out there
[3:14:20.740 --> 3:14:22.740]  that CNN has become sort of a partisan.
[3:14:22.740 --> 3:14:24.740]  I mean, even groups like
[3:14:24.740 --> 3:14:26.740]  Provda didn't go as far as CNN does these days.
[3:14:26.740 --> 3:14:28.740]  I mean, because they wanted to maintain some appearance,
[3:14:28.740 --> 3:14:30.740]  they weren't as obviously biased as they were.
[3:14:30.740 --> 3:14:32.740]  And how early on
[3:14:32.740 --> 3:14:34.740]  did you recognize the problems
[3:14:34.740 --> 3:14:36.740]  with CNN's bias? And
[3:14:36.740 --> 3:14:38.740]  at what point did you realize it was cultural
[3:14:38.740 --> 3:14:40.740]  and institutional as opposed to just individual?
[3:14:42.740 --> 3:14:44.740]  Probably for me, just within the first 90 days.
[3:14:44.740 --> 3:14:46.740]  Right.
[3:14:46.740 --> 3:14:48.740]  And by the way, thank you for your call, Ryan
[3:14:48.740 --> 3:14:50.740]  and everything. And we've all had that experience where cat food
[3:14:50.740 --> 3:14:52.740]  pops up the next day.
[3:14:52.740 --> 3:14:54.740]  And I have marketing.
[3:14:54.740 --> 3:14:56.740]  I'm just trying to go back to him real quick.
[3:14:56.740 --> 3:14:58.740]  And we actually have digital marketing people
[3:14:58.740 --> 3:15:00.740]  that tell me that swear up and down that that's
[3:15:00.740 --> 3:15:02.740]  not listening to us. But I'm like, how else could it
[3:15:02.740 --> 3:15:04.740]  know exactly what we want or we buy
[3:15:04.740 --> 3:15:06.740]  or I pop up with
[3:15:06.740 --> 3:15:08.740]  you know, like
[3:15:08.740 --> 3:15:10.740]  like tampon products or whatever, you know, like
[3:15:10.740 --> 3:15:12.740]  you know, so it just
[3:15:12.740 --> 3:15:14.740]  it is, I'm sure everyone's had that
[3:15:14.740 --> 3:15:16.740]  unique experience, like you said, in
[3:15:16.740 --> 3:15:18.740]  a rural area where you get cat food
[3:15:18.740 --> 3:15:20.740]  and you didn't even buy it or your wealth buy it and pops up on
[3:15:20.740 --> 3:15:22.740]  your feet. It's wild. It blows my mind
[3:15:22.740 --> 3:15:24.740]  how good these things are getting.
[3:15:24.740 --> 3:15:26.740]  But to your question, can you repeat it just a little
[3:15:26.740 --> 3:15:28.740]  bit, Mr. Barnes? I'm sorry, like where were we going?
[3:15:28.740 --> 3:15:30.740]  We'll come back with that after the break to discuss it about
[3:15:30.740 --> 3:15:32.740]  how you figured out that there was a cultural
[3:15:32.740 --> 3:15:34.740]  institutional effect. And it wasn't just
[3:15:34.740 --> 3:15:36.740]  individual.
[3:15:36.740 --> 3:15:38.740]  And right after the break, we'll go that further with the CNN
[3:15:38.740 --> 3:15:40.740]  whistleblower to go into how the institutional
[3:15:40.740 --> 3:15:42.740]  media is operating. We appreciate all the
[3:15:42.740 --> 3:15:44.740]  calls. We may have a few more calls
[3:15:44.740 --> 3:15:46.740]  after the break. And so come back
[3:15:46.740 --> 3:15:48.740]  and we'll discuss more on the Alex Jones
[3:15:48.740 --> 3:15:50.740]  show. The CNN whistleblower exposing
[3:15:50.740 --> 3:15:52.740]  the truth about institutional media
[3:15:52.740 --> 3:15:54.740]  in the modern age.
[3:16:00.740 --> 3:16:02.740]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[3:16:02.740 --> 3:16:04.740]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago
[3:16:04.740 --> 3:16:06.740]  when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[3:16:06.740 --> 3:16:08.740]  I sued the IRS and won. I beat the IRS
[3:16:08.740 --> 3:16:10.740]  then and I've been beating them ever since.
[3:16:10.740 --> 3:16:12.740]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement
[3:16:12.740 --> 3:16:14.740]  and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax
[3:16:14.740 --> 3:16:16.740]  problems they thought might never be solved.
[3:16:16.740 --> 3:16:18.740]  I can help you too. If you owe taxes
[3:16:18.740 --> 3:16:20.740]  you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[3:16:20.740 --> 3:16:22.740]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.

[3:17:00.740 --> 3:17:02.740]  One of the most frequently asked questions
[3:17:02.740 --> 3:17:04.740]  we get in customer service is
[3:17:04.740 --> 3:17:06.740]  what is the real red pill?
[3:17:06.740 --> 3:17:08.740]  What is the real red pill plus?
[3:17:08.740 --> 3:17:10.740]  Well, real red pill is a vitamin
[3:17:10.740 --> 3:17:12.740]  mineral multivitamin high quality
[3:17:12.740 --> 3:17:14.740]  with preglinone.
[3:17:14.740 --> 3:17:16.740]  Real red pill plus is the same thing
[3:17:16.740 --> 3:17:18.740]  with a little bit of clean added
[3:17:18.740 --> 3:17:20.740]  energy on top of it as well.
[3:17:20.740 --> 3:17:22.740]  That kicks in in 30 minutes.
[3:17:22.740 --> 3:17:24.740]  But the preglinone kicks in
[3:17:24.740 --> 3:17:26.740]  in about a week or so.
[3:17:26.740 --> 3:17:28.740]  Folks, look into preglinone for yourself.
[3:17:28.740 --> 3:17:30.740]  Look into high end sources of it
[3:17:30.740 --> 3:17:32.740]  like real red pill and real red pill plus.
[3:17:32.740 --> 3:17:34.740]  And then you'll definitely want to try it out
[3:17:34.740 --> 3:17:36.740]  and see the effects you get
[3:17:36.740 --> 3:17:38.740]  within about 7 days to 2 weeks
[3:17:38.740 --> 3:17:40.740]  generally. But believe me, it's a missing link.
[3:17:40.740 --> 3:17:42.740]  You need to find out about it
[3:17:42.740 --> 3:17:44.740]  as we age. Preglinone levels go down.
[3:17:44.740 --> 3:17:46.740]  All of our hormones in our body are manufactured
[3:17:46.740 --> 3:17:48.740]  by the body using preglinone.
[3:17:48.740 --> 3:17:50.740]  You need to learn about preglinone
[3:17:50.740 --> 3:17:52.740]  and then you need to get
[3:17:52.740 --> 3:17:54.740]  the real red pill or the real red pill plus.
[3:17:54.740 --> 3:17:56.740]  Now 50% off
[3:17:56.740 --> 3:17:58.740]  at infowarslife.com
[3:17:58.740 --> 3:18:00.740]  The real red pill plus.
[3:18:00.740 --> 3:18:02.740]  It is now an admitted fact.
[3:18:02.740 --> 3:18:04.740]  Fluoride out of the water
[3:18:04.740 --> 3:18:06.740]  has caused tens of millions of Americans
[3:18:06.740 --> 3:18:08.740]  to be brain damaged
[3:18:08.740 --> 3:18:10.740]  and to have infertility and low IQs.
[3:18:10.740 --> 3:18:12.740]  And it doesn't matter
[3:18:12.740 --> 3:18:14.740]  if the Journal of American Medical Association
[3:18:14.740 --> 3:18:16.740]  comes out and says it's terrible,
[3:18:16.740 --> 3:18:18.740]  still the city's put it in the water
[3:18:18.740 --> 3:18:20.740]  because the ruling globalists want you
[3:18:20.740 --> 3:18:22.740]  and your family poisoned and stupid.
[3:18:22.740 --> 3:18:24.740]  And they sure don't want you to know about
[3:18:24.740 --> 3:18:26.740]  the good allergen iodine
[3:18:26.740 --> 3:18:28.740]  that absolutely increases
[3:18:28.740 --> 3:18:30.740]  IQ and fertility
[3:18:30.740 --> 3:18:32.740]  and makes life so wonderful
[3:18:32.740 --> 3:18:34.740]  and opens up your consciousness, your mind, everything.
[3:18:34.740 --> 3:18:36.740]  Thank God, thank God
[3:18:36.740 --> 3:18:38.740]  I discovered this eight years ago.
[3:18:38.740 --> 3:18:40.740]  Of course the enemy knows all about it
[3:18:40.740 --> 3:18:42.740]  and they hope you don't discover it.
[3:18:42.740 --> 3:18:44.740]  They hope you just roll over and die.
[3:18:44.740 --> 3:18:46.740]  So whatever you do, don't visit infowarsstore.com

[3:18:52.740 --> 3:18:54.740]  with your bottle of Biotrusillinium.
[3:18:54.740 --> 3:18:56.740]  Whatever you do, don't go to infowarsstore.com
[3:18:56.740 --> 3:18:58.740]  just give up America, give up Christians,
[3:18:58.740 --> 3:19:00.740]  drink your fluoride and die.
[3:19:00.740 --> 3:19:02.740]  Give indecision, give him a...
[3:19:04.740 --> 3:19:06.740]  Here are the facts.
[3:19:06.740 --> 3:19:08.740]  Iodine raises IQ
[3:19:08.740 --> 3:19:10.740]  and across the board
[3:19:10.740 --> 3:19:12.740]  makes you more healthy in thousands of top studies
[3:19:12.740 --> 3:19:14.740]  including the American Medical Journal.
[3:19:14.740 --> 3:19:16.740]  Every type of fluoride
[3:19:16.740 --> 3:19:18.740]  lowers IQ,
[3:19:18.740 --> 3:19:20.740]  massively increases cancer
[3:19:20.740 --> 3:19:22.740]  and destroys fertility.
[3:19:22.740 --> 3:19:24.740]  That's the facts.
[3:19:24.740 --> 3:19:26.740]  Let's talk about the Iodine conspiracy
[3:19:26.740 --> 3:19:28.740]  and then once you've learned about it
[3:19:28.740 --> 3:19:30.740]  protect yourself and your family.
[3:19:30.740 --> 3:19:32.740]  The reason I'm so hot on this
[3:19:32.740 --> 3:19:34.740]  is the globalists put the fluoride in the water
[3:19:34.740 --> 3:19:36.740]  while making sure we don't get the Iodine.
[3:19:36.740 --> 3:19:38.740]  In China they put the Iodine in the water
[3:19:38.740 --> 3:19:40.740]  and ban the fluoride
[3:19:40.740 --> 3:19:42.740]  because they've already got their people under their control.
[3:19:42.740 --> 3:19:44.740]  The globalists are targeting us here.
[3:19:44.740 --> 3:19:46.740]  Please go to infowarsstore.com
[3:19:46.740 --> 3:19:48.740]  experience Iodine and Biotrusillinium
[3:19:48.740 --> 3:19:50.740]  that goes with it together
[3:19:50.740 --> 3:19:52.740]  and then once you see the great results
[3:19:52.740 --> 3:19:54.740]  this is the Achilles' Hill of the Globalist.
[3:19:54.740 --> 3:19:56.740]  It's a win-win situation.
[3:19:56.740 --> 3:19:58.740]  The only way you lose is not taking action.
[3:19:58.740 --> 3:20:23.740]  MUSIC
[3:20:23.740 --> 3:20:25.740]  We're here with the CNN whistleblower
[3:20:25.740 --> 3:20:28.740]  who blew the whistle on the degree to which the CNN
[3:20:28.740 --> 3:20:31.740]  cultural influence has so corrupted and corroded
[3:20:31.740 --> 3:20:35.740]  the independence of independent journalism at CNN
[3:20:35.740 --> 3:20:38.740]  that there isn't any independent journalism left at CNN.
[3:20:38.740 --> 3:20:40.740]  And it shows the scale of it.
[3:20:40.740 --> 3:20:42.740]  We were just discussing before the break
[3:20:42.740 --> 3:20:44.740]  your recognition of when you realized it was not just
[3:20:44.740 --> 3:20:46.740]  individual but cultural at CNN
[3:20:46.740 --> 3:20:48.740]  the scope and the scale of the problem.
[3:20:48.740 --> 3:20:49.740]  Can you talk about that?
[3:20:49.740 --> 3:20:50.740]  Yeah, I noticed it.
[3:20:50.740 --> 3:20:52.740]  I wouldn't say immediately because remember
[3:20:52.740 --> 3:20:54.740]  I was still kind of fully entrenched on the left
[3:20:54.740 --> 3:20:55.740]  when I was there.
[3:20:55.740 --> 3:20:58.740]  I didn't start having my antenna raised
[3:20:58.740 --> 3:21:00.740]  until even a few weeks into it
[3:21:00.740 --> 3:21:02.740]  like those 9 a.m. calls because they were
[3:21:02.740 --> 3:21:04.740]  broadcast on speakerphone.
[3:21:04.740 --> 3:21:06.740]  Most someone had it on somewhere on the floor.
[3:21:06.740 --> 3:21:08.740]  I obviously didn't realize it was Zucker
[3:21:08.740 --> 3:21:10.740]  who else I just figured it was someone important
[3:21:10.740 --> 3:21:12.740]  because people were dialing in every day
[3:21:12.740 --> 3:21:14.740]  and kind of getting their marching orders.
[3:21:14.740 --> 3:21:16.740]  And I thought that's how all news ran
[3:21:16.740 --> 3:21:18.740]  and then of course you saw the Hannity interviewer
[3:21:18.740 --> 3:21:19.740]  he's like, that's never happened to me.
[3:21:19.740 --> 3:21:21.740]  I'm like, oh okay, whatever.
[3:21:21.740 --> 3:21:23.740]  But when I would hear these people
[3:21:23.740 --> 3:21:25.740]  again, I didn't know it was Zucker who was at the time
[3:21:25.740 --> 3:21:27.740]  but higher ups talking about, hey,
[3:21:27.740 --> 3:21:29.740]  we need to cover the story this way or that way
[3:21:29.740 --> 3:21:31.740]  because of it'll make Trump look bad or this or that
[3:21:31.740 --> 3:21:34.740]  and I remember kind of that singular thought,
[3:21:34.740 --> 3:21:36.740]  remember I was a never Trump or at the time
[3:21:36.740 --> 3:21:38.740]  and I was like, wait a minute,
[3:21:38.740 --> 3:21:39.740]  Trump's gonna make himself look bad.
[3:21:39.740 --> 3:21:41.740]  Why are we trying to help him?
[3:21:41.740 --> 3:21:42.740]  Right.
[3:21:42.740 --> 3:21:44.740]  And so that was kind of my,
[3:21:44.740 --> 3:21:46.740]  when my first antenna went up and then that
[3:21:46.740 --> 3:21:48.740]  would sort of kind of led me down a path
[3:21:48.740 --> 3:21:50.740]  to listening more and more to see
[3:21:50.740 --> 3:21:52.740]  like, okay, I have this new theory
[3:21:52.740 --> 3:21:54.740]  so let's see if it plays out.
[3:21:54.740 --> 3:21:56.740]  And again, it just did and it built up
[3:21:56.740 --> 3:21:58.740]  grains of sand, grains of rice till
[3:21:58.740 --> 3:22:00.740]  I just, I couldn't take it anymore in February
[3:22:00.740 --> 3:22:01.740]  of this year.
[3:22:01.740 --> 3:22:02.740]  Right.
[3:22:02.740 --> 3:22:05.740]  So right at two years was
[3:22:05.740 --> 3:22:07.740]  when I was, and again this whole time
[3:22:07.740 --> 3:22:09.740]  from about six to nine months on is when I started
[3:22:09.740 --> 3:22:12.740]  basically modifying my beliefs and kind of researching
[3:22:12.740 --> 3:22:14.740]  but right at the two year mark was when
[3:22:14.740 --> 3:22:16.740]  I just, I couldn't take it anymore.
[3:22:16.740 --> 3:22:17.740]  And to what degree like did you start doing
[3:22:17.740 --> 3:22:18.740]  independent research?
[3:22:18.740 --> 3:22:19.740]  Absolutely.
[3:22:19.740 --> 3:22:22.740]  And so, you know, I just started,
[3:22:22.740 --> 3:22:24.740]  so I tell my friends when they said,
[3:22:24.740 --> 3:22:25.740]  hey, what was your job like?
[3:22:25.740 --> 3:22:27.740]  And I said, I equated it to a firefighter
[3:22:27.740 --> 3:22:29.740]  not in the thing of danger by any means,
[3:22:29.740 --> 3:22:31.740]  but in the fact that there was a pretty
[3:22:31.740 --> 3:22:33.740]  decent amount of downtime, but when it was go,
[3:22:33.740 --> 3:22:34.740]  it was go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[3:22:34.740 --> 3:22:36.740]  Like the Pittsburgh shooting and the
[3:22:36.740 --> 3:22:38.740]  synagogue shooting, you know, I was on my
[3:22:38.740 --> 3:22:40.740]  off day and had to whisk away to Pittsburgh
[3:22:40.740 --> 3:22:42.740]  for nine days when my mom was in town.
[3:22:42.740 --> 3:22:43.740]  Right.
[3:22:43.740 --> 3:22:45.740]  And meeting my fiance for the first time.
[3:22:45.740 --> 3:22:46.740]  Awesome.
[3:22:46.740 --> 3:22:47.740]  Wow.
[3:22:47.740 --> 3:22:48.740]  That went over well.
[3:22:48.740 --> 3:22:49.740]  Of course.
[3:22:49.740 --> 3:22:51.740]  But yeah, just in my own independent
[3:22:51.740 --> 3:22:53.740]  research because like I knew what I believed
[3:22:53.740 --> 3:22:55.740]  at the time, you know, fully, you know,
[3:22:55.740 --> 3:22:57.740]  fully progressive, leftist type thing.
[3:22:57.740 --> 3:23:00.740]  And then I started listening to just a few
[3:23:00.740 --> 3:23:02.740]  different points of view on YouTube.
[3:23:02.740 --> 3:23:04.740]  Like I would say, you know, like your
[3:23:04.740 --> 3:23:06.740]  Crowders, your Anthony Bryan Logans,
[3:23:06.740 --> 3:23:09.740]  you know, every now and then, you know,
[3:23:09.740 --> 3:23:11.740]  that type of ecosystem, like your Charlie
[3:23:11.740 --> 3:23:12.740]  Kirk's and stuff like that.
[3:23:12.740 --> 3:23:13.740]  And it kind of led me down this path.
[3:23:13.740 --> 3:23:15.740]  I'm like, well, let me at least hear what
[3:23:15.740 --> 3:23:16.740]  the other side has to say.
[3:23:16.740 --> 3:23:18.740]  And I told the turning point people that
[3:23:18.740 --> 3:23:20.740]  where I spoke at last night in A&M,
[3:23:20.740 --> 3:23:22.740]  I was like, you guys don't realize that
[3:23:22.740 --> 3:23:25.740]  indirectly you guys had a hand in my,
[3:23:25.740 --> 3:23:27.740]  you know, red pilling and awakening.
[3:23:27.740 --> 3:23:29.740]  So and it blew their mind when they
[3:23:29.740 --> 3:23:30.740]  thought about that.
[3:23:30.740 --> 3:23:32.740]  So yeah, indirectly down the food chain,
[3:23:32.740 --> 3:23:34.740]  like you guys had a hand in this video that
[3:23:34.740 --> 3:23:36.740]  we just watched or that just released.
[3:23:36.740 --> 3:23:39.740]  So it's just, I credits a lot of good
[3:23:39.740 --> 3:23:40.740]  friends that were able to sit down like
[3:23:40.740 --> 3:23:42.740]  Goldie that called in earlier and just
[3:23:42.740 --> 3:23:44.740]  good friends like that were sitting down
[3:23:44.740 --> 3:23:46.740]  and willing to have the conversation with
[3:23:46.740 --> 3:23:48.740]  me as I was a screeching NPC as I
[3:23:48.740 --> 3:23:50.740]  like to call myself back in the day.
[3:23:50.740 --> 3:23:52.740]  But again, that's only one side that's
[3:23:52.740 --> 3:23:54.740]  willing to sit down and have a beer and
[3:23:54.740 --> 3:23:56.740]  discuss things in an open environment.
[3:23:56.740 --> 3:23:59.740]  You know what classical liberal liberalism
[3:23:59.740 --> 3:24:00.740]  used to be.
[3:24:00.740 --> 3:24:01.740]  Right, exactly.
[3:24:01.740 --> 3:24:02.740]  It's sort of the Dave Rubin style.
[3:24:02.740 --> 3:24:04.740]  Yeah, and he was one of my
[3:24:04.740 --> 3:24:05.740]  ecosystem as well.
[3:24:05.740 --> 3:24:06.740]  I love me some Dave Rubin.
[3:24:06.740 --> 3:24:07.740]  Yeah.
[3:24:07.740 --> 3:24:08.740]  Well, it's fascinating.
[3:24:08.740 --> 3:24:09.740]  I mean, it's the reason why they foreclose
[3:24:09.740 --> 3:24:12.740]  the success of Infowars reaching
[3:24:12.740 --> 3:24:14.740]  new people, converting people into
[3:24:14.740 --> 3:24:16.740]  looking at things from a different
[3:24:16.740 --> 3:24:17.740]  perspective.
[3:24:17.740 --> 3:24:19.740]  And because Infowars, the model relies
[3:24:19.740 --> 3:24:21.740]  upon people's own conscience, people's
[3:24:21.740 --> 3:24:23.740]  own cognitive capacities to make their
[3:24:23.740 --> 3:24:25.740]  own decisions and their own determinations
[3:24:25.740 --> 3:24:28.740]  was so revolutionary and it's effective.
[3:24:28.740 --> 3:24:29.740]  It's in 2016.
[3:24:29.740 --> 3:24:30.740]  It's why it's banned.
[3:24:30.740 --> 3:24:33.740]  It's they don't want people like you to
[3:24:33.740 --> 3:24:35.740]  be able to find things like Infowars
[3:24:35.740 --> 3:24:37.740]  in an easily accessible platform or
[3:24:37.740 --> 3:24:39.740]  format that can change their perspective
[3:24:39.740 --> 3:24:41.740]  or frame of mind or expose them to
[3:24:41.740 --> 3:24:43.740]  information they didn't previously have.
[3:24:43.740 --> 3:24:44.740]  Absolutely.
[3:24:44.740 --> 3:24:45.740]  So that they can make their own decisions.
[3:24:45.740 --> 3:24:46.740]  And you guys have a, and forgive me for
[3:24:46.740 --> 3:24:48.740]  stepping in, but I mean, correct me if
[3:24:48.740 --> 3:24:49.740]  I'm wrong, but Infowars, like your
[3:24:49.740 --> 3:24:51.740]  crowders, everything like that is
[3:24:51.740 --> 3:24:53.740]  pretty much user supported.
[3:24:53.740 --> 3:24:54.740]  So it's like...
[3:24:54.740 --> 3:24:56.740]  Well, Infowars is people should go to
[3:24:56.740 --> 3:24:58.740]  Infowarsstore.com and buy their stuff.
[3:24:58.740 --> 3:24:59.740]  Buy their stuff, whatever, yeah.
[3:24:59.740 --> 3:25:01.740]  It's the most democratic version of a
[3:25:01.740 --> 3:25:02.740]  free press.
[3:25:02.740 --> 3:25:03.740]  But with your dollar, right?
[3:25:03.740 --> 3:25:04.740]  It was how they originated under,
[3:25:04.740 --> 3:25:05.740]  when the founders started, they actually,
[3:25:05.740 --> 3:25:07.740]  the government actually gave money to
[3:25:07.740 --> 3:25:08.740]  set up small press operations.
[3:25:08.740 --> 3:25:09.740]  Okay.
[3:25:09.740 --> 3:25:10.740]  Because they were desperate for an
[3:25:10.740 --> 3:25:12.740]  independent free press to be vibrant and
[3:25:12.740 --> 3:25:14.740]  alive, even if that free press was
[3:25:14.740 --> 3:25:15.740]  attacking the politicians that were
[3:25:15.740 --> 3:25:16.740]  giving them the money.
[3:25:16.740 --> 3:25:17.740]  That's how committed they were to the
[3:25:17.740 --> 3:25:18.740]  idea of a free press.
[3:25:18.740 --> 3:25:20.740]  They meant a free press, not only free
[3:25:20.740 --> 3:25:21.740]  from governmental control and censorship
[3:25:21.740 --> 3:25:23.740]  and suppression, but also a free press
[3:25:23.740 --> 3:25:24.740]  independent of corporate control,
[3:25:24.740 --> 3:25:26.740]  independent of foreign powers,
[3:25:26.740 --> 3:25:28.740]  independent of being corrupted by
[3:25:28.740 --> 3:25:30.740]  institutional effects.
[3:25:30.740 --> 3:25:32.740]  And so Infowars has recreated that
[3:25:32.740 --> 3:25:34.740]  model by democratizing access to the
[3:25:34.740 --> 3:25:36.740]  press by having a democratic support
[3:25:36.740 --> 3:25:37.740]  system.
[3:25:37.740 --> 3:25:39.740]  Infowars is the only media of this
[3:25:39.740 --> 3:25:41.740]  size and scale that doesn't depend on
[3:25:41.740 --> 3:25:43.740]  big dollar donors, that doesn't depend
[3:25:43.740 --> 3:25:45.740]  on corporate advertisers, that doesn't
[3:25:45.740 --> 3:25:47.740]  depend on institutional subsidy or
[3:25:47.740 --> 3:25:48.740]  support.
[3:25:48.740 --> 3:25:50.740]  And instead, in fact, Infowars has been
[3:25:50.740 --> 3:25:52.740]  the most attacked in terms of getting
[3:25:52.740 --> 3:25:54.740]  access to platforms and technologies
[3:25:54.740 --> 3:25:56.740]  to reach people's and audience of any
[3:25:56.740 --> 3:25:58.740]  major network in the world.
[3:25:58.740 --> 3:26:00.740]  And it's because it's a truly democratic
[3:26:00.740 --> 3:26:01.740]  structure.
[3:26:01.740 --> 3:26:02.740]  It's supported because people go to
[3:26:02.740 --> 3:26:04.740]  Infowarsdoor.com and buy what they
[3:26:04.740 --> 3:26:05.740]  want to buy anyway.
[3:26:05.740 --> 3:26:07.740]  And they get to buy their own products
[3:26:07.740 --> 3:26:09.740]  that they're already buying that make
[3:26:09.740 --> 3:26:11.740]  their lives healthier and wealthier and
[3:26:11.740 --> 3:26:13.740]  wiser, but they get to buy them at a
[3:26:13.740 --> 3:26:15.740]  discounted price, and then while doing
[3:26:15.740 --> 3:26:17.740]  it at a discounted price, they're
[3:26:17.740 --> 3:26:19.740]  supporting it the truest, freest press
[3:26:19.740 --> 3:26:20.740]  in the world.
[3:26:20.740 --> 3:26:22.740]  And so it's an extraordinary experiment.
[3:26:22.740 --> 3:26:24.740]  And it's what CNN originally sort of
[3:26:24.740 --> 3:26:26.740]  partially talked about being this
[3:26:26.740 --> 3:26:28.740]  independent barometer, this New York
[3:26:28.740 --> 3:26:30.740]  Times of sort of the gray lady of news
[3:26:30.740 --> 3:26:32.740]  for TV, for the world, and it's
[3:26:32.740 --> 3:26:34.740]  sad how it is eroded and degraded
[3:26:34.740 --> 3:26:36.740]  into a mockery and a shadow of
[3:26:36.740 --> 3:26:37.740]  itself.
[3:26:37.740 --> 3:26:39.740]  And that's why the Infowars
[3:26:39.740 --> 3:26:41.740]  is sort of a constant
[3:26:41.740 --> 3:26:43.740]  mirror to what they should be, what
[3:26:43.740 --> 3:26:45.740]  they hold themselves out as, but are
[3:26:45.740 --> 3:26:46.740]  not.
[3:26:46.740 --> 3:26:48.740]  And all the demonization they direct
[3:26:48.740 --> 3:26:50.740]  at Infowars, like Oliver Darcy and
[3:26:50.740 --> 3:26:52.740]  others routinely do, is really a
[3:26:52.740 --> 3:26:54.740]  reflection of CNN looking in the mirror
[3:26:54.740 --> 3:26:55.740]  at its own problems.
[3:26:55.740 --> 3:26:57.740]  What they accuse Infowars of is what
[3:26:57.740 --> 3:26:58.740]  they do.
[3:26:58.740 --> 3:27:00.740]  They are a propaganda arm of the
[3:27:00.740 --> 3:27:01.740]  institutional press and of the
[3:27:01.740 --> 3:27:03.740]  intelligence agencies and structures.
[3:27:03.740 --> 3:27:04.740]  Why is it?
[3:27:04.740 --> 3:27:06.740]  I remember discussing with Bernie
[3:27:06.740 --> 3:27:08.740]  Shaw when he said they weren't going
[3:27:08.740 --> 3:27:10.740]  to do it, but then they still did do
[3:27:10.740 --> 3:27:11.740]  it, make mistakes again.
[3:27:11.740 --> 3:27:13.740]  It's like, why is it CNN has never got
[3:27:13.740 --> 3:27:14.740]  a single war right?
[3:27:14.740 --> 3:27:16.740]  Why is it they did the war propaganda
[3:27:16.740 --> 3:27:17.740]  machine every time?
[3:27:17.740 --> 3:27:19.740]  How is it they just fall for it
[3:27:19.740 --> 3:27:20.740]  repeatedly and routinely?
[3:27:20.740 --> 3:27:22.740]  The fact that they've been pushing a
[3:27:22.740 --> 3:27:24.740]  kooky conspiracy theory concerning
[3:27:24.740 --> 3:27:26.740]  Russia and Trump, and now extending
[3:27:26.740 --> 3:27:28.740]  it to Tulsi Gabbard, a Democratic
[3:27:28.740 --> 3:27:29.740]  leftist congresswoman.
[3:27:29.740 --> 3:27:30.740]  Who's running for president?
[3:27:30.740 --> 3:27:31.740]  Exactly.
[3:27:31.740 --> 3:27:33.740]  Who's one of the most, I mean,
[3:27:33.740 --> 3:27:34.740]  prominent of the Democrats had an IQ
[3:27:34.740 --> 3:27:36.740]  over 50, they'd nominate, because she
[3:27:36.740 --> 3:27:38.740]  would be a problem for Trump, particularly
[3:27:38.740 --> 3:27:39.740]  in the upper Midwest.
[3:27:39.740 --> 3:27:41.740]  But she has zero chance.
[3:27:41.740 --> 3:27:43.740]  That's why Hillary is annoyed and
[3:27:43.740 --> 3:27:44.740]  offended that she's even on the
[3:27:44.740 --> 3:27:46.740]  platform stage.
[3:27:46.740 --> 3:27:47.740]  And so we see it.
[3:27:47.740 --> 3:27:49.740]  So yeah, we do have a lot of
[3:27:49.740 --> 3:27:50.740]  callers and people that have waited
[3:27:50.740 --> 3:27:51.740]  for a long time.
[3:27:51.740 --> 3:27:53.740]  Let's go to Johnny in Canada.
[3:27:55.740 --> 3:27:56.740]  Hey, Mr. Burns, how are you?
[3:27:56.740 --> 3:27:57.740]  Very good.
[3:27:57.740 --> 3:27:58.740]  Thank you, sir.
[3:27:59.740 --> 3:28:01.740]  I got to say my apologies for any
[3:28:01.740 --> 3:28:05.740]  issues my country have given to you
[3:28:05.740 --> 3:28:08.740]  and Mr. Alec over the last
[3:28:08.740 --> 3:28:09.740]  six months or so.
[3:28:10.740 --> 3:28:12.740]  Yeah, all I can say is a lot of
[3:28:12.740 --> 3:28:16.740]  PVC pipe and shovels are being bought
[3:28:16.740 --> 3:28:18.740]  at Home Depot here in Canada.
[3:28:18.740 --> 3:28:22.740]  Jerry, I kind of know where you're
[3:28:22.740 --> 3:28:23.740]  at.
[3:28:24.740 --> 3:28:26.740]  You're about to embark on a wonderful
[3:28:26.740 --> 3:28:27.740]  journey of parenthood.
[3:28:27.740 --> 3:28:29.740]  There's nothing wrong with it at all.
[3:28:29.740 --> 3:28:30.740]  It's just awesome.
[3:28:30.740 --> 3:28:31.740]  Very thank you.
[3:28:31.740 --> 3:28:32.740]  And you're welcome.
[3:28:33.740 --> 3:28:35.740]  I got to ask you a question.
[3:28:35.740 --> 3:28:36.740]  Aside from the fact that you're
[3:28:36.740 --> 3:28:38.740]  jumping off a train bound for
[3:28:38.740 --> 3:28:39.740]  Auschwitz in the dark.
[3:28:42.740 --> 3:28:44.740]  I've had that issue myself.
[3:28:44.740 --> 3:28:46.740]  What you're talking about or what
[3:28:46.740 --> 3:28:47.740]  you talked about your experience
[3:28:47.740 --> 3:28:49.740]  is a lot like working in an
[3:28:49.740 --> 3:28:50.740]  intelligent cell.
[3:28:51.740 --> 3:28:52.740]  It's all putting out fires.
[3:28:53.740 --> 3:28:55.740]  When you decided that...
[3:28:55.740 --> 3:28:56.740]  We'll come back.
[3:28:56.740 --> 3:28:57.740]  We got to take a break, but we'll
[3:28:57.740 --> 3:28:58.740]  come right back to the rest of
[3:28:58.740 --> 3:28:59.740]  your question right after the
[3:28:59.740 --> 3:29:00.740]  break.
[3:29:00.740 --> 3:29:01.740]  Come back with...
[3:29:01.740 --> 3:29:02.740]  One of the most frequently asked
[3:29:02.740 --> 3:29:03.740]  questions we get in customer
[3:29:03.740 --> 3:29:04.740]  service is,
[3:29:04.740 --> 3:29:06.740]  what is the real red pill?
[3:29:06.740 --> 3:29:08.740]  And what is the real red pill plus?
[3:29:08.740 --> 3:29:10.740]  Well, real red pill is a vitamin,
[3:29:10.740 --> 3:29:12.740]  mineral, multivitamin, high quality
[3:29:12.740 --> 3:29:14.740]  with preglinone.
[3:29:14.740 --> 3:29:16.740]  Real red pill plus is the same thing
[3:29:16.740 --> 3:29:18.740]  with a little bit of clean added
[3:29:18.740 --> 3:29:20.740]  energy on top of it as well.
[3:29:20.740 --> 3:29:22.740]  That kicks in in 30 minutes.
[3:29:22.740 --> 3:29:24.740]  But the preglinone kicks in in
[3:29:24.740 --> 3:29:26.740]  about a week or so.
[3:29:26.740 --> 3:29:27.740]  Folks, look into preglinone for
[3:29:27.740 --> 3:29:29.740]  yourself.
[3:29:29.740 --> 3:29:30.740]  Look into high-end sources of it
[3:29:30.740 --> 3:29:32.740]  like real red pill and real red
[3:29:32.740 --> 3:29:33.740]  pill plus.
[3:29:33.740 --> 3:29:34.740]  And then you'll definitely want to
[3:29:34.740 --> 3:29:35.740]  try it out and see the effects
[3:29:35.740 --> 3:29:37.740]  you get within about seven days to
[3:29:37.740 --> 3:29:38.740]  two weeks generally.
[3:29:38.740 --> 3:29:40.740]  But believe me, it's a missing link.
[3:29:40.740 --> 3:29:42.740]  You need to find out about it.
[3:29:42.740 --> 3:29:44.740]  As we age, preglinone levels go
[3:29:44.740 --> 3:29:45.740]  down.
[3:29:45.740 --> 3:29:46.740]  All of our hormones in our body
[3:29:46.740 --> 3:29:47.740]  are manufactured by the body
[3:29:47.740 --> 3:29:49.740]  using preglinone.
[3:29:49.740 --> 3:29:51.740]  You need to learn about preglinone
[3:29:51.740 --> 3:29:53.740]  and then you need to get the real
[3:29:53.740 --> 3:29:55.740]  red pill or the real red pill plus.
[3:29:55.740 --> 3:29:57.740]  Now, 50% off at
[3:29:57.740 --> 3:29:59.740]  infowarslife.com, the real red
[3:29:59.740 --> 3:30:01.740]  pill plus.
[3:30:01.740 --> 3:30:03.740]  Please listen to this information
[3:30:03.740 --> 3:30:05.740]  because it can save your life and
[3:30:05.740 --> 3:30:07.740]  it can save the life of others.
[3:30:07.740 --> 3:30:08.740]  There couldn't be more critical
[3:30:08.740 --> 3:30:10.740]  information for your physical body.
[3:30:10.740 --> 3:30:11.740]  God's more important when it comes
[3:30:11.740 --> 3:30:13.740]  to your soul, but this is most
[3:30:13.740 --> 3:30:15.740]  important when it comes to your body.
[3:30:15.740 --> 3:30:17.740]  If people didn't know that you
[3:30:17.740 --> 3:30:19.740]  put motor oil in a car's oil
[3:30:19.740 --> 3:30:21.740]  container to lube the engine,
[3:30:21.740 --> 3:30:23.740]  they might be able to be conned
[3:30:23.740 --> 3:30:25.740]  and think you put salt water in it,
[3:30:25.740 --> 3:30:26.740]  but it would seize up the engine
[3:30:26.740 --> 3:30:28.740]  pretty much instantly.
[3:30:28.740 --> 3:30:29.740]  Well, if they put fluoride in the
[3:30:29.740 --> 3:30:31.740]  human body, it causes cancer,
[3:30:31.740 --> 3:30:32.740]  dumbs us down, and destroys
[3:30:32.740 --> 3:30:33.740]  fertility.
[3:30:33.740 --> 3:30:34.740]  If you put the good halogen in the
[3:30:34.740 --> 3:30:36.740]  body, high quality iodine,
[3:30:36.740 --> 3:30:38.740]  it's like putting good high quality
[3:30:38.740 --> 3:30:40.740]  motor oil in the car that's
[3:30:40.740 --> 3:30:41.740]  supposed to run on it.
[3:30:41.740 --> 3:30:42.740]  It's that simple.
[3:30:42.740 --> 3:30:43.740]  Find out about the iodine
[3:30:43.740 --> 3:30:44.740]  conspiracy at infowarslife.com
[3:30:44.740 --> 3:30:45.740]  and find out what the globalists
[3:30:45.740 --> 3:30:47.740]  hope that you do not research this
[3:30:47.740 --> 3:30:48.740]  information.
[3:30:48.740 --> 3:30:49.740]  Ladies and gentlemen, whatever you
[3:30:49.740 --> 3:30:51.740]  do, research iodine deficiency.
[3:30:51.740 --> 3:30:53.740]  It's the key to everything.
[3:30:53.740 --> 3:30:55.740]  And then go and take advantage of
[3:30:55.740 --> 3:30:57.740]  the 60% off combo with our two
[3:30:57.740 --> 3:30:58.740]  different types of high quality
[3:30:58.740 --> 3:30:59.740]  iodine and biotrystallinium
[3:30:59.740 --> 3:31:01.740]  at infowarsstore.com today.
[3:31:01.740 --> 3:31:05.740]  Infowars presents Alex Jones.
[3:31:05.740 --> 3:31:07.740]  In August of 2019, JAMA,
[3:31:07.740 --> 3:31:09.740]  or the Journal of the American
[3:31:09.740 --> 3:31:10.740]  Medical Association, the most
[3:31:10.740 --> 3:31:12.740]  prestigious came out and said,
[3:31:12.740 --> 3:31:14.740]  oh my gosh, just a little bit of
[3:31:14.740 --> 3:31:15.740]  fluoride in the water causes
[3:31:15.740 --> 3:31:17.740]  lowered IQs, massive infertility
[3:31:17.740 --> 3:31:18.740]  and a lot of babies dying in the
[3:31:18.740 --> 3:31:20.740]  womb, and it causes cancer.
[3:31:20.740 --> 3:31:22.740]  That was just one of thousands of
[3:31:22.740 --> 3:31:23.740]  studies admitting this.
[3:31:23.740 --> 3:31:24.740]  You know, it's illegal to have
[3:31:24.740 --> 3:31:26.740]  even one part per billion in the
[3:31:26.740 --> 3:31:28.740]  water in places like California
[3:31:28.740 --> 3:31:30.740]  unless it's part of adding fluoride.
[3:31:30.740 --> 3:31:32.740]  And then they have a waiver and can
[3:31:32.740 --> 3:31:34.740]  add thousands of deadly chemicals
[3:31:34.740 --> 3:31:36.740]  to your water because the liberals
[3:31:36.740 --> 3:31:38.740]  love you and they want to sexualize
[3:31:38.740 --> 3:31:39.740]  your children.
[3:31:39.740 --> 3:31:41.740]  So whatever you do, drink lots of
[3:31:41.740 --> 3:31:42.740]  fluoride.
[3:31:42.740 --> 3:31:43.740]  And don't get the thing that counters
[3:31:43.740 --> 3:31:45.740]  the iodine at infowarsstore.com.
[3:31:45.740 --> 3:31:48.740]  Drink fluoride and die.
[3:31:48.740 --> 3:31:50.740]  Drink fluoride dirty Americans
[3:31:50.740 --> 3:31:51.740]  and roll over.
[3:31:51.740 --> 3:31:53.740]  Do not visit infowarsstore.com
[3:31:53.740 --> 3:31:54.740]  and get high poly iodine
[3:31:54.740 --> 3:31:55.740]  counter it.
[3:31:55.740 --> 3:31:57.740]  No, roll over and die dirty
[3:31:57.740 --> 3:31:58.740]  Americans.
[3:31:58.740 --> 3:32:27.740]  That's right, drink the fluoride.
[3:32:27.740 --> 3:32:29.740]  Do not visit infowarsstore.com
[3:32:29.740 --> 3:32:31.740]  and get the good halogen.
[3:32:31.740 --> 3:32:33.740]  I mean the bad halogen, iodine.
[3:32:33.740 --> 3:32:35.740]  Don't give it to yourself, your husband,
[3:32:35.740 --> 3:32:37.740]  your wife, your children.
[3:32:37.740 --> 3:32:40.740]  Just drink the fluoride and plunge
[3:32:40.740 --> 3:32:43.740]  into subservience to us.
[3:32:43.740 --> 3:32:45.740]  We don't want to compete with you.
[3:32:45.740 --> 3:32:47.740]  Just drink the fluoride.
[3:32:47.740 --> 3:32:50.740]  Don't learn about how deadly it is
[3:32:50.740 --> 3:32:51.740]  and whatever you do.
[3:32:51.740 --> 3:32:53.740]  Don't support Alex Jones.
[3:32:53.740 --> 3:32:55.740]  Remember, I'm speaking with a soft
[3:32:55.740 --> 3:32:57.740]  voice, so I'm a liberal.
[3:32:57.740 --> 3:32:59.740]  Oh, and let Namble have access
[3:32:59.740 --> 3:33:01.740]  to your children, huh?
[3:33:04.740 --> 3:33:08.740]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:33:19.740 --> 3:33:21.740]  All right, back on the Alex Jones Show
[3:33:21.740 --> 3:33:22.740]  at infowars.com.
[3:33:22.740 --> 3:33:24.740]  Let's go back to Johnny and Cannon.
[3:33:24.740 --> 3:33:26.740]  So we got cut off there before the break
[3:33:26.740 --> 3:33:27.740]  to finish your question.
[3:33:27.740 --> 3:33:28.740]  Go ahead, Johnny.
[3:33:28.740 --> 3:33:31.740]  Yeah, starting to get to the point.
[3:33:31.740 --> 3:33:33.740]  Gary, my hat's off to you.
[3:33:33.740 --> 3:33:35.740]  A lot of us out there, we only have
[3:33:35.740 --> 3:33:37.740]  part of the solution.
[3:33:37.740 --> 3:33:39.740]  I'm just saying, I just want to ask,
[3:33:39.740 --> 3:33:41.740]  like when you finally made the decision,
[3:33:41.740 --> 3:33:43.740]  did you turn the light on on your question
[3:33:43.740 --> 3:33:46.740]  and say you're going to go with this course of action
[3:33:46.740 --> 3:33:48.740]  and then decide that, holy crap,
[3:33:48.740 --> 3:33:50.740]  you've seen a whole bunch more
[3:33:50.740 --> 3:33:52.740]  in this whole thing.
[3:33:52.740 --> 3:33:55.740]  Like with me, it was in Cannada
[3:33:55.740 --> 3:33:58.740]  when Alex first came to Canada.
[3:33:58.740 --> 3:34:01.740]  I don't know, it's just a whole
[3:34:01.740 --> 3:34:04.740]  flood work of things.
[3:34:04.740 --> 3:34:06.740]  I don't mean to be rambling,
[3:34:06.740 --> 3:34:08.740]  but that's the way I look at it.
[3:34:08.740 --> 3:34:09.740]  No, you're fine.
[3:34:09.740 --> 3:34:10.740]  It's passed off to you guys.
[3:34:10.740 --> 3:34:11.740]  No, much appreciated, sir.
[3:34:11.740 --> 3:34:13.740]  It's definitely, if I understood your question
[3:34:13.740 --> 3:34:14.740]  correctly, it was kind of like,
[3:34:14.740 --> 3:34:16.740]  was there like a singular moment that
[3:34:16.740 --> 3:34:18.740]  kind of woke me up for lack of a better term?
[3:34:18.740 --> 3:34:20.740]  Was that what you were asking?
[3:34:20.740 --> 3:34:23.740]  No, it's like, once you came that determination
[3:34:23.740 --> 3:34:27.740]  or got to go with that course of action,
[3:34:27.740 --> 3:34:29.740]  did you see other things happening
[3:34:29.740 --> 3:34:31.740]  that was like totally wrong?
[3:34:31.740 --> 3:34:33.740]  Well, I mean, I saw a bunch of things
[3:34:33.740 --> 3:34:35.740]  that I deemed that were, you know,
[3:34:35.740 --> 3:34:37.740]  not above board, you know,
[3:34:37.740 --> 3:34:38.740]  almost from the beginning.
[3:34:38.740 --> 3:34:40.740]  So it was just hard because I was fighting
[3:34:40.740 --> 3:34:43.740]  my own biases at the moment,
[3:34:43.740 --> 3:34:44.740]  my own dissonance and stuff,
[3:34:44.740 --> 3:34:45.740]  like, no, this can't be right.
[3:34:45.740 --> 3:34:47.740]  I mean, it straight up was kind of like
[3:34:47.740 --> 3:34:49.740]  a matrix movie, not to be overly cliche,
[3:34:49.740 --> 3:34:52.740]  but, you know, trying to like, no, it can't be, no.
[3:34:52.740 --> 3:34:58.740]  And basically, I was fighting that for two years.
[3:34:58.740 --> 3:35:01.740]  And, you know, going in and I don't know,
[3:35:01.740 --> 3:35:02.740]  there's all kinds of studies out there
[3:35:02.740 --> 3:35:04.740]  where even if you don't hear the news,
[3:35:04.740 --> 3:35:06.740]  your mind will pick up the chyrons
[3:35:06.740 --> 3:35:07.740]  and you'll still consume content.
[3:35:07.740 --> 3:35:10.740]  And there, I'm assuming the same at every bureau,
[3:35:10.740 --> 3:35:11.740]  I can't attest to Fox,
[3:35:11.740 --> 3:35:13.740]  I only worked at CNN, but, you know,
[3:35:13.740 --> 3:35:17.740]  where there's TVs everywhere, like everywhere.
[3:35:17.740 --> 3:35:19.740]  There's even a TV on in the bathroom
[3:35:19.740 --> 3:35:21.740]  with whatever's live going on.
[3:35:21.740 --> 3:35:23.740]  So, like, I was consuming news,
[3:35:23.740 --> 3:35:25.740]  whether by hearing or visually,
[3:35:25.740 --> 3:35:27.740]  you know, eight hours a day,
[3:35:27.740 --> 3:35:28.740]  you know, pretty much my full work day.
[3:35:28.740 --> 3:35:31.740]  I mean, I could be on my laptop doing whatever,
[3:35:31.740 --> 3:35:33.740]  but I glance up and I see the chyrons.
[3:35:33.740 --> 3:35:35.740]  So I'm still consuming news.
[3:35:35.740 --> 3:35:37.740]  And it was just one of the things
[3:35:37.740 --> 3:35:39.740]  where it built and built and built and built
[3:35:39.740 --> 3:35:41.740]  and then finally at the two years at, you know,
[3:35:41.740 --> 3:35:44.740]  roughly at CPAC when I was covered it.
[3:35:44.740 --> 3:35:47.740]  And then I saw James O'Keeffe at the Epic Times booth
[3:35:47.740 --> 3:35:48.740]  and I'm like, you know what?
[3:35:48.740 --> 3:35:49.740]  I'm going to go talk to this guy.
[3:35:49.740 --> 3:35:50.740]  And then he got up on stage
[3:35:50.740 --> 3:35:52.740]  and that was the Facebook insider reveal.
[3:35:52.740 --> 3:35:55.740]  And that's when I'm like, you know, be brave, do something.
[3:35:55.740 --> 3:35:56.740]  I'm like, you know what?
[3:35:56.740 --> 3:35:57.740]  I'm going to be brave.
[3:35:57.740 --> 3:35:58.740]  I'm going to do something.
[3:35:58.740 --> 3:36:00.740]  And I went down and sought him out.
[3:36:00.740 --> 3:36:03.740]  And then that was in February or March
[3:36:03.740 --> 3:36:05.740]  or whenever the exact day was,
[3:36:05.740 --> 3:36:07.740]  all the way up until this past Monday.
[3:36:07.740 --> 3:36:09.740]  So a roundabout way to answer your question,
[3:36:09.740 --> 3:36:13.740]  but hopefully that kind of answer did I apologize.
[3:36:13.740 --> 3:36:14.740]  Yeah, thanks.
[3:36:14.740 --> 3:36:15.740]  Thank you, Johnny.
[3:36:15.740 --> 3:36:18.740]  Let's go to Rob in Canada.
[3:36:18.740 --> 3:36:21.740]  Hey, Kerry, thanks a lot for being on the show today.
[3:36:21.740 --> 3:36:23.740]  But I just get back to the same question.
[3:36:23.740 --> 3:36:25.740]  Can you give you like an example,
[3:36:25.740 --> 3:36:27.740]  like say the border wall coverage?
[3:36:27.740 --> 3:36:30.740]  What, give me an example of something that was going on
[3:36:30.740 --> 3:36:33.740]  at CNN when you're there at work
[3:36:33.740 --> 3:36:36.740]  and you're just like, no, I know this is wrong.
[3:36:36.740 --> 3:36:38.740]  Cause I got all my friends.
[3:36:38.740 --> 3:36:40.740]  These are highly educated people,
[3:36:40.740 --> 3:36:42.740]  master's degrees, Ivy League schools.
[3:36:42.740 --> 3:36:43.740]  And they're like, no way.
[3:36:43.740 --> 3:36:46.740]  There's no way the New York Times is lying or distorting stuff.
[3:36:46.740 --> 3:36:47.740]  They couldn't do that.
[3:36:47.740 --> 3:36:50.740]  Washington Post, all this, the most trusted, you know, name,
[3:36:50.740 --> 3:36:51.740]  name and news.
[3:36:51.740 --> 3:36:54.740]  So can you, can you share with me an example?
[3:36:54.740 --> 3:36:55.740]  Sure.
[3:36:55.740 --> 3:36:56.740]  Yeah, absolutely.
[3:36:56.740 --> 3:37:00.740]  And Robert, maybe you can maybe kind of help me out on this.
[3:37:00.740 --> 3:37:02.740]  I'm trying to remember the exact facts
[3:37:02.740 --> 3:37:04.740]  or the ladies and gentlemen in the room.
[3:37:04.740 --> 3:37:07.740]  But I remember, yeah, the border wall crisis,
[3:37:07.740 --> 3:37:08.740]  the kids in cages, you know,
[3:37:08.740 --> 3:37:10.740]  kids are dying and stuff like that.
[3:37:10.740 --> 3:37:13.740]  And again, I can't remember if it was exactly CNN,
[3:37:13.740 --> 3:37:15.740]  the outlet or any of their friends.
[3:37:15.740 --> 3:37:18.740]  But, you know, they just brought up the old Obama pictures
[3:37:18.740 --> 3:37:20.740]  from what, 14 or 15 with the kids with the,
[3:37:20.740 --> 3:37:22.740]  what like foil blankets type thing.
[3:37:22.740 --> 3:37:25.740]  And, you know, that was created during the previous administration.
[3:37:25.740 --> 3:37:26.740]  And of course it's not what about ism,
[3:37:26.740 --> 3:37:28.740]  but it's one of those things where like,
[3:37:28.740 --> 3:37:31.740]  I knew that picture that was floating around on Twitter
[3:37:31.740 --> 3:37:33.740]  and stuff like that about, you know,
[3:37:33.740 --> 3:37:36.740]  the previous administration with the kids and in the cages
[3:37:36.740 --> 3:37:38.740]  and the blankets and stuff.
[3:37:38.740 --> 3:37:40.740]  I even knew that.
[3:37:40.740 --> 3:37:43.740]  And then having to see the mainstream outlets
[3:37:43.740 --> 3:37:45.740]  kind of have to backtrack only when people
[3:37:45.740 --> 3:37:47.740]  from the independent media were calling them out.
[3:37:47.740 --> 3:37:49.740]  So that was another one of those grains of rice
[3:37:49.740 --> 3:37:50.740]  that were tipping the scale.
[3:37:50.740 --> 3:37:52.740]  I'm like, what are we doing here?
[3:37:52.740 --> 3:37:54.740]  Like, you know, and that's right after,
[3:37:54.740 --> 3:37:55.740]  correct me if I'm wrong,
[3:37:55.740 --> 3:37:57.740]  that's after the new slogan came out,
[3:37:57.740 --> 3:37:59.740]  the facts first type thing.
[3:37:59.740 --> 3:38:01.740]  And that blatantly was not a fact.
[3:38:01.740 --> 3:38:05.740]  They were using a previous photo from, you know,
[3:38:05.740 --> 3:38:08.740]  the previous administration to basically, you know,
[3:38:08.740 --> 3:38:10.740]  spike the ball on the current narrative
[3:38:10.740 --> 3:38:11.740]  that they wanted to spin.
[3:38:11.740 --> 3:38:14.740]  And that was just, again, one of many grains of rice,
[3:38:14.740 --> 3:38:15.740]  so to speak.
[3:38:15.740 --> 3:38:17.740]  And as just, it kind of led me further down the path.
[3:38:17.740 --> 3:38:19.740]  It's like, what are we doing here?
[3:38:19.740 --> 3:38:22.740]  Like we're, I mean, I was never a journalist.
[3:38:22.740 --> 3:38:24.740]  It's just, but this can't be journalism,
[3:38:24.740 --> 3:38:26.740]  if that makes sense.
[3:38:26.740 --> 3:38:29.740]  I mean, I had a sister that went to journalism school.
[3:38:29.740 --> 3:38:31.740]  I don't know if I want to know.
[3:38:31.740 --> 3:38:34.740]  You know, that these guys are dishonest.
[3:38:34.740 --> 3:38:36.740]  There's just, you know.
[3:38:36.740 --> 3:38:38.740]  So can you share another example?
[3:38:38.740 --> 3:38:41.740]  Like, you know, the most recent impeachment type stuff.
[3:38:41.740 --> 3:38:44.740]  Yeah, well, the most recent example for me,
[3:38:44.740 --> 3:38:46.740]  again, you know, I left about a week or so ago,
[3:38:46.740 --> 3:38:50.740]  but I was boots on ground covering the Mueller report,
[3:38:50.740 --> 3:38:52.740]  you know, leading up to it,
[3:38:52.740 --> 3:38:54.740]  hey, we're going to do all day wall-to-wall coverage,
[3:38:54.740 --> 3:38:56.740]  you know, 24-7 on the Mueller report.
[3:38:56.740 --> 3:38:57.740]  It's like, cool.
[3:38:57.740 --> 3:39:00.740]  Now we're going to finally get to the bottom of this Russia thing.
[3:39:00.740 --> 3:39:04.740]  And, you know, I, at this point, I was fully red-billed,
[3:39:04.740 --> 3:39:07.740]  but I wanted to go see, like, hey, if there's something,
[3:39:07.740 --> 3:39:11.740]  let's see what $50 million and however many thousands of men,
[3:39:11.740 --> 3:39:15.740]  let's, I wanted to see if this was legit
[3:39:15.740 --> 3:39:17.740]  or if there's smoke and mirrors,
[3:39:17.740 --> 3:39:20.740]  just like the millions of Americans, like, okay, let's,
[3:39:20.740 --> 3:39:23.740]  like if it was proven collusion or anything like that was Russian,
[3:39:23.740 --> 3:39:25.740]  like, cool, let's, let's ring up the impeachment process
[3:39:25.740 --> 3:39:26.740]  and go from there.
[3:39:26.740 --> 3:39:28.740]  Like, that's where I was, just like most Americans,
[3:39:28.740 --> 3:39:31.740]  in fact, bear out, let's pursue this course of action.
[3:39:31.740 --> 3:39:34.740]  Came out to be not at what everyone thought it was
[3:39:34.740 --> 3:39:38.740]  and you didn't hear about it ever since then
[3:39:38.740 --> 3:39:40.740]  or, I mean, the new, when Mueller testified,
[3:39:40.740 --> 3:39:42.740]  what, a few weeks later,
[3:39:42.740 --> 3:39:44.740]  of course, there was one of the big lead-up to that
[3:39:44.740 --> 3:39:47.740]  and then what happened after, after, you know,
[3:39:47.740 --> 3:39:49.740]  Special Counsel Mueller testified.
[3:39:49.740 --> 3:39:52.740]  We still haven't heard anything else about it after that.
[3:39:52.740 --> 3:39:53.740]  And now we're into Ukraine.
[3:39:53.740 --> 3:39:56.740]  It's just, again, I can't speak to expertise on all these things.
[3:39:56.740 --> 3:39:58.740]  It's just seeing what I saw from the inside.
[3:39:58.740 --> 3:40:01.740]  Like, we heard nothing but wall-to-wall Mueller coverage.
[3:40:01.740 --> 3:40:04.740]  Report came out, kind of fell flat.
[3:40:04.740 --> 3:40:06.740]  Then wall-to-wall coverage on, hey, Mueller's going to testify.
[3:40:06.740 --> 3:40:08.740]  Cool, let's see what's going on.
[3:40:08.740 --> 3:40:10.740]  Did he even write the report?
[3:40:10.740 --> 3:40:12.740]  Again, I'm not speaking one way or the other.
[3:40:12.740 --> 3:40:15.740]  It just, if you watch those eight hours of whatever,
[3:40:15.740 --> 3:40:17.740]  it seemed a little suspect.
[3:40:17.740 --> 3:40:18.740]  And again, I'm just a layman.
[3:40:18.740 --> 3:40:22.740]  So even to me, it was like, what is going on here?
[3:40:22.740 --> 3:40:25.740]  So, you know, that's kind of the most recent one I can think of.
[3:40:25.740 --> 3:40:29.740]  And by that time, I was like, I know I'm doing the right thing.
[3:40:29.740 --> 3:40:30.740]  Oh, no doubt about it.
[3:40:30.740 --> 3:40:32.740]  I mean, well, the other thing is you look at, I mean,
[3:40:32.740 --> 3:40:35.740]  like the impeachment coverage, it's so over-the-top political,
[3:40:35.740 --> 3:40:37.740]  it loses its credibility.
[3:40:37.740 --> 3:40:40.740]  And even if you want to be a partisan, activist,
[3:40:40.740 --> 3:40:43.740]  or news organization, there's still a way to present the story
[3:40:43.740 --> 3:40:47.740]  in such a way that people don't see you as just partisan acts,
[3:40:47.740 --> 3:40:50.740]  that you maintain some degree of credibility as independent
[3:40:50.740 --> 3:40:51.740]  or authoritative.
[3:40:51.740 --> 3:40:55.740]  They're not even maintaining that by the, oh, they're over-the-top
[3:40:55.740 --> 3:40:56.740]  assertiveness.
[3:40:56.740 --> 3:40:59.740]  They've chosen to be overtly political while lying about being
[3:40:59.740 --> 3:41:00.740]  overtly political.
[3:41:00.740 --> 3:41:02.740]  And over, and unbiased as well.
[3:41:02.740 --> 3:41:04.740]  Again, I tell the story all the time, like I watch Fox,
[3:41:04.740 --> 3:41:06.740]  I know I'm getting conservative point of view.
[3:41:06.740 --> 3:41:09.740]  MSNBC, I know I'm getting a left or progressive point of view.
[3:41:09.740 --> 3:41:10.740]  Perfect.
[3:41:10.740 --> 3:41:11.740]  Young Turks, hyper-progressive.
[3:41:11.740 --> 3:41:12.740]  It's honest.
[3:41:12.740 --> 3:41:15.740]  Yeah, it's like, cool, I know what I'm getting when I consume it.
[3:41:15.740 --> 3:41:17.740]  Cool, I'm getting it from position X.
[3:41:17.740 --> 3:41:22.740]  Oh, exactly, you're not getting something that is so disguised
[3:41:22.740 --> 3:41:24.740]  as apolitical when it's overtly political.
[3:41:24.740 --> 3:41:27.740]  And now, the other people that you know there,
[3:41:27.740 --> 3:41:30.740]  do you think there may be future whistleblowers from CNN as well?
[3:41:30.740 --> 3:41:31.740]  I hope so.
[3:41:31.740 --> 3:41:34.740]  You know, I forget which tape it was on, but I mean,
[3:41:34.740 --> 3:41:37.740]  first of all, again, these people are good people to your listeners.
[3:41:37.740 --> 3:41:39.740]  They're good people, as you saw from the tapes,
[3:41:39.740 --> 3:41:41.740]  that just want to do their job,
[3:41:41.740 --> 3:41:44.740]  but are obviously being handcuffed from up high.
[3:41:44.740 --> 3:41:47.740]  And I've had that conversation,
[3:41:47.740 --> 3:41:49.740]  those conversations you know on tape,
[3:41:49.740 --> 3:41:50.740]  that's not a one-off,
[3:41:50.740 --> 3:41:53.740]  I've had that exact conversation with many people in the building
[3:41:53.740 --> 3:41:55.740]  that say, hey, I don't like Trump,
[3:41:55.740 --> 3:41:58.740]  but I don't think we should keep covering him all the time.
[3:41:58.740 --> 3:42:00.740]  There's an earthquake and Bermuda,
[3:42:00.740 --> 3:42:01.740]  or this happened over here,
[3:42:01.740 --> 3:42:05.740]  or there's so many great newsworthy things in the world happening,
[3:42:05.740 --> 3:42:08.740]  but hey, let's stay on Trump.
[3:42:08.740 --> 3:42:09.740]  Okay.
[3:42:09.740 --> 3:42:12.740]  And even when, for instance, we were covering the Pittsburgh shooting,
[3:42:12.740 --> 3:42:14.740]  you know, we're in the press pool with, like, all the different,
[3:42:14.740 --> 3:42:17.740]  like, your NBCs, your ABCs, all those people,
[3:42:17.740 --> 3:42:20.740]  all of them had the same thing, like,
[3:42:20.740 --> 3:42:21.740]  at least now we're covering news.
[3:42:21.740 --> 3:42:24.740]  Like, granted, Trump is part of it because he's coming,
[3:42:24.740 --> 3:42:26.740]  but it's like, cool, we're actually covering news.
[3:42:26.740 --> 3:42:29.740]  Like, everyone was excited to get out of D.C. and cover news.
[3:42:29.740 --> 3:42:30.740]  Right.
[3:42:30.740 --> 3:42:32.740]  The reason why they went to work at CNN was to cover news.
[3:42:32.740 --> 3:42:33.740]  Absolutely.
[3:42:33.740 --> 3:42:35.740]  It wasn't to be part of their own information war.
[3:42:35.740 --> 3:42:36.740]  No.
[3:42:36.740 --> 3:42:38.740]  To propagate their own particular position.
[3:42:38.740 --> 3:42:40.740]  So, thanks, Robin Cannon, for your questions.
[3:42:40.740 --> 3:42:42.740]  He's going to take a little bit of a break and we'll come back
[3:42:42.740 --> 3:42:45.740]  right after the break to discuss further some of the breaking news
[3:42:45.740 --> 3:42:48.740]  about impeachment, some of the breaking news about other aspects
[3:42:48.740 --> 3:42:50.740]  of what's happening around the world today,
[3:42:50.740 --> 3:42:53.740]  and cover some of the news that CNN won't cover.
[3:42:53.740 --> 3:42:55.740]  So, come back and talk to us after the break.
[3:42:55.740 --> 3:43:11.740]  You're here at the Alex Jones Show and in FullWars.com.
[3:43:26.740 --> 3:43:35.740]  Alex Jones has been on air with that gravely evil male voice telling you
[3:43:35.740 --> 3:43:38.740]  to look into how iodine is good for your body and essential
[3:43:38.740 --> 3:43:40.740]  and how fluoride is bad.
[3:43:40.740 --> 3:43:43.740]  Listen, that's a conspiracy theory.
[3:43:43.740 --> 3:43:44.740]  Okay.
[3:43:44.740 --> 3:43:45.740]  There's no medical journals.
[3:43:45.740 --> 3:43:46.740]  There's no facts.
[3:43:46.740 --> 3:43:48.740]  You need fluoride.
[3:43:48.740 --> 3:43:53.740]  Just drink extra fluoride and then you don't have to think anymore
[3:43:53.740 --> 3:44:00.740]  and just go to sleep when I talk to you real soft like this.
[3:44:00.740 --> 3:44:04.740]  Again, I'm not talking down to the InfoWars audience,
[3:44:04.740 --> 3:44:08.740]  but I've been banging my head against a wall for a long time on this
[3:44:08.740 --> 3:44:11.740]  and I'm talking about fluoride and I'm talking about iodine.
[3:44:11.740 --> 3:44:16.740]  Now, if you have a boat, a motorboat, let's say an old glass-tron boat
[3:44:16.740 --> 3:44:21.740]  and you want to take it on the lake, you've got to have a lake to put it in.
[3:44:21.740 --> 3:44:24.740]  If you're a human being, you've got to have oxygen to live.
[3:44:24.740 --> 3:44:25.740]  Okay.
[3:44:25.740 --> 3:44:26.740]  It's the same thing.
[3:44:26.740 --> 3:44:29.740]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, the bad halogen is fluoride.
[3:44:29.740 --> 3:44:32.740]  That's why in every Western nation, they put it in the water.
[3:44:32.740 --> 3:44:34.740]  They're going to teach us Christians lay down and die.
[3:44:34.740 --> 3:44:36.740]  The chai comms don't put it in the water.
[3:44:36.740 --> 3:44:37.740]  They'd execute you if you did that.
[3:44:37.740 --> 3:44:41.740]  They put iodine in the water because it's the good halogen
[3:44:41.740 --> 3:44:45.740]  and increases fertility and lifespan and intelligence and everything else.
[3:44:45.740 --> 3:44:49.740]  So again, learn about the iodine conspiracy at InfoWars.com.
[3:44:49.740 --> 3:44:51.740]  We have all the documents and articles linked.
[3:44:51.740 --> 3:44:53.740]  And then get good iodine for yourself
[3:44:53.740 --> 3:44:55.740]  because the globalists are fighting to make sure you don't.
[3:44:55.740 --> 3:45:21.740]  Again, get iodine at InfoWars.com.
[3:45:21.740 --> 3:45:25.740]  That's the facts. Learn about the iodine conspiracy.
[3:45:25.740 --> 3:45:28.740]  And then once you've learned about it, protect yourself and your family.
[3:45:28.740 --> 3:45:32.740]  The reason I'm so hot on this is the globalists put the fluoride in the water
[3:45:32.740 --> 3:45:34.740]  while making sure we don't get the iodine.
[3:45:34.740 --> 3:45:38.740]  In China, they put the iodine in the water and ban the fluoride
[3:45:38.740 --> 3:45:40.740]  because they've already got their people under their control.
[3:45:40.740 --> 3:45:42.740]  The globalists are targeting us here.
[3:45:42.740 --> 3:45:44.740]  Please go to InfoWars.com.
[3:45:44.740 --> 3:45:48.740]  Experience iodine and bio-trustilinium that goes with it together.
[3:45:48.740 --> 3:45:51.740]  And then once you see the great results, warn others.
[3:45:51.740 --> 3:45:53.740]  This is the Achilles Hill of the Globalist.
[3:45:53.740 --> 3:45:56.740]  It's a win-win situation. The only way you lose is not taking action.
[3:45:56.740 --> 3:45:57.740]  Take action now.
[3:45:57.740 --> 3:46:19.740]  Hello here. My name is Bethelman. I work for my father Lucifer.
[3:46:19.740 --> 3:46:27.740]  We took control of you over a hundred years ago. We've been spiking your water with fluoride to lower your fertility and to hurt you.
[3:46:27.740 --> 3:46:29.740]  This works so well.
[3:46:29.740 --> 3:46:34.740]  But now because of liability and because of people warning inside the government what's happening,
[3:46:34.740 --> 3:46:39.740]  the Journal of American Medical Association and others are admitting what we've done.
[3:46:39.740 --> 3:46:47.740]  It makes me so angry. So whatever you do, just stay in that haze and drink fluoride and give it to your children.
[3:46:47.740 --> 3:46:51.740]  And don't visit InfoWars.com and learn about the iodine conspiracy.
[3:46:51.740 --> 3:46:56.740]  And get 60% off on X2 and X3 together with bio-trustilinium from the mustard seed.
[3:46:56.740 --> 3:47:17.740]  Submit to us. InfoWarsStore.com.
[3:47:17.740 --> 3:47:21.740]  All right. Well, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show and InfoWars.com.
[3:47:21.740 --> 3:47:23.740]  The whistleblower is taking a little bit of a break.
[3:47:23.740 --> 3:47:28.740]  But let's go to some of the videos that were exposed by his whistleblower.
[3:47:28.740 --> 3:47:39.740]  Let's look at, I think, it's Project Veritas video number 18 where we see that the CNN's corruption and collusion between big media and the institutional press
[3:47:39.740 --> 3:47:48.740]  and the big tech and the intelligence community extends to the democratic primary process as they decide who gets to win and who gets to lose in the debates,
[3:47:48.740 --> 3:47:51.740]  who's going to be perceived and portrayed as a winner and a loser.
[3:47:51.740 --> 3:47:56.740]  So let's go to video 18 that goes into and exposes some of that detail.
[3:47:56.740 --> 3:48:00.740]  The important work that was exposed by the whistleblower.
[3:48:00.740 --> 3:48:04.740]  Ah, we don't. OK, we're going to try to locate that video and come back to it.
[3:48:04.740 --> 3:48:09.740]  What you see and what CNN has done, and you see it today in the story where they're talking about dramatic deposition,
[3:48:09.740 --> 3:48:11.740]  rocks, Trump impeachment, defense.
[3:48:11.740 --> 3:48:14.740]  You see an example of what the whistleblower is talking about.
[3:48:14.740 --> 3:48:20.740]  You see both what is included and what is excluded, what is contextualized and how it's contextualized.
[3:48:20.740 --> 3:48:24.740]  Let's start with the first sentence, which says the deposition by Bill Taylor.
[3:48:24.740 --> 3:48:28.740]  And now here, right away, they called a deposition, not really a deposition.
[3:48:28.740 --> 3:48:31.740]  You would have both sides would be meaningfully present.
[3:48:31.740 --> 3:48:33.740]  Both sides could ask questions.
[3:48:33.740 --> 3:48:35.740]  It would be a transcript of it.
[3:48:35.740 --> 3:48:37.740]  The transcript would be easily available.
[3:48:37.740 --> 3:48:44.740]  Often they're videotaped, contrasted to the depositions that have been you've seen in other cases in other contexts.
[3:48:44.740 --> 3:48:46.740]  None of that is available here.
[3:48:46.740 --> 3:48:51.740]  We don't have a video deposition that we can see. We don't have a transcript that's been fully released.
[3:48:51.740 --> 3:48:56.740]  We don't see any questions being asked by anyone other than Democrats as far as what's being told in the story.
[3:48:56.740 --> 3:49:02.740]  So right away, there's this creation of this deposition, which has this inferential reference to something that's independent,
[3:49:02.740 --> 3:49:08.740]  something that's organic, something that's authentic, something that's part of the legal process to discover the truth.
[3:49:08.740 --> 3:49:13.740]  And by using that label, when it's really an inaccurate label for what took place here,
[3:49:13.740 --> 3:49:17.740]  it's just one illustration and example of how CNN is misleading its audience.
[3:49:17.740 --> 3:49:19.740]  But that's not the only example of it.
[3:49:19.740 --> 3:49:23.740]  The deposition by Bill Taylor, and here they just say Bill Taylor.
[3:49:23.740 --> 3:49:26.740]  So they don't go into detail as to who Bill Taylor is.
[3:49:26.740 --> 3:49:30.740]  They don't discuss that Bill Taylor is sort of a career state department guy,
[3:49:30.740 --> 3:49:33.740]  that Bill Taylor is connected to Obama and Democrats,
[3:49:33.740 --> 3:49:38.740]  that Bill Taylor was not someone that Trump was particularly interested in promoting and putting out there.
[3:49:38.740 --> 3:49:40.740]  So they don't contextualize Bill Taylor at all.
[3:49:40.740 --> 3:49:45.740]  They make him sound like just an independent, honest, as they call him, a top U.S. diplomat.
[3:49:45.740 --> 3:49:48.740]  They don't put in background and in context how he got there.
[3:49:48.740 --> 3:49:55.740]  They don't put in context that he was there because the person he replaced had allegations of corruption
[3:49:55.740 --> 3:50:00.740]  and improper relationships with Ukraine that go all the way back to the coup in Ukraine that took place there.
[3:50:00.740 --> 3:50:04.740]  The so-called Maiden Revolution back in 2014,
[3:50:04.740 --> 3:50:09.740]  where you had the United States government connected to parties that have a long history of Nazi connections
[3:50:09.740 --> 3:50:16.740]  in far western Ukraine that involve allegations of illicit staged coup events
[3:50:16.740 --> 3:50:20.740]  where they were making it look like the government was shooting at people when it appeared later on
[3:50:20.740 --> 3:50:23.740]  that there was inadequate evidence for that allegation.
[3:50:23.740 --> 3:50:26.740]  So you had whether money was changing hands in certain ways.
[3:50:26.740 --> 3:50:31.740]  You have the energy boards and energy companies that were connected to various controversial transactions
[3:50:31.740 --> 3:50:35.740]  that ultimately included not only Biden's son sitting on one of those boards of one of those companies,
[3:50:35.740 --> 3:50:39.740]  but other sort of XCIA connected participants that were sitting on those companies.
[3:50:39.740 --> 3:50:48.740]  So the former ambassador to Ukraine who also was connected to Christopher Steele in the Dirty dossier
[3:50:48.740 --> 3:50:54.740]  that was used by the Hillary Clinton campaign through Fusion GPS to attack the president in 2016
[3:50:54.740 --> 3:50:59.740]  that led to the initiated and instigated and was the predicate for the entire spy gate scandal
[3:50:59.740 --> 3:51:02.740]  that Ukrainian ambassador was connected to all of that.
[3:51:02.740 --> 3:51:07.740]  So here just as the deposition by Bill Taylor, and there's no context as to who Bill Taylor is,
[3:51:07.740 --> 3:51:10.740]  no context as to why he's in the position that he's in,
[3:51:10.740 --> 3:51:14.740]  no context as to whether or not he has a bias against the president,
[3:51:14.740 --> 3:51:19.740]  no context as to whether or not he himself had been involved or was connected to these scandals
[3:51:19.740 --> 3:51:23.740]  involved in Ukraine and the Obama administration's political involvement in Ukraine,
[3:51:23.740 --> 3:51:29.740]  documented in even left-leaning documentaries like Ukraine on Fire by Oliver Stone.
[3:51:29.740 --> 3:51:34.740]  So the first part is they use the word deposition, don't put it on context, creates misleading inferences.
[3:51:34.740 --> 3:51:39.740]  The second major phrase in the sentence is Bill Taylor which they again don't give context to
[3:51:39.740 --> 3:51:43.740]  except to call him a U.S. diplomat which is misleading under the circumstances.
[3:51:43.740 --> 3:51:47.740]  And then they say appears to directly refute. Now there again we see appears, right?
[3:51:47.740 --> 3:51:54.740]  That means he did not actually directly refute the president or they would say he directly refuted President Trump.
[3:51:54.740 --> 3:51:59.740]  They say appears to directly refute. And they use that phraseology because the word appears
[3:51:59.740 --> 3:52:04.740]  is one that can protect you from libel suits and here the president has already put CNN on notice
[3:52:04.740 --> 3:52:09.740]  that he plans on pursuing legal action against them based on the information disclosed by the whistleblower
[3:52:09.740 --> 3:52:14.740]  who's been with us in the studio today. So again there's this sort of misleading inference,
[3:52:14.740 --> 3:52:17.740]  appears to directly refute. Well that's different than the headline,
[3:52:17.740 --> 3:52:25.740]  dramatic deposition, rocks Trump's impeachment defense. And then it says well appears to kind of maybe sort of refute the president.
[3:52:25.740 --> 3:52:31.740]  That there was no quid pro quo in his dealings and here they say quote with the former Soviet state.
[3:52:31.740 --> 3:52:35.740]  So here again they're trying to bring up that Soviet specter, the communism specter,
[3:52:35.740 --> 3:52:40.740]  that Hillary Clinton is repeatedly and routinely relying upon for her saying Russia, Russia, Russia,
[3:52:40.740 --> 3:52:43.740]  whether it's Tulsi Gabbard, whether it's the president, whether it's anyone else.
[3:52:43.740 --> 3:52:48.740]  And they're connecting, I mean why the Ukraine has not been a Soviet state since 1991.
[3:52:48.740 --> 3:52:56.740]  So you're talking about almost 30 years since they've been any connection to the Soviet Union.
[3:52:56.740 --> 3:53:00.740]  So why bring up the former Soviet state in this context?
[3:53:00.740 --> 3:53:06.740]  It's clearly meant to trigger fear, trigger worry, trigger an image of a totalitarian,
[3:53:06.740 --> 3:53:13.740]  tile government that can do terrible and horrible things. So it's this independent bureaucrat,
[3:53:13.740 --> 3:53:20.740]  but instead is portrayed as a diplomat who's out to expose the president being involved with the former Soviet state.
[3:53:20.740 --> 3:53:25.740]  This is how news turns into propaganda.
[3:53:25.740 --> 3:53:29.740]  And so you see that consistently throughout the entire article.
[3:53:29.740 --> 3:53:37.740]  The article has Kerry Cordero, a CNN legal analyst and former senior justice department and intelligence community official
[3:53:37.740 --> 3:53:41.740]  describe Taylor's testimony as an incredibly big deal.
[3:53:41.740 --> 3:53:48.740]  Now here again you see a CNN legal analyst and former senior justice department and here's the part intelligence community official.
[3:53:48.740 --> 3:53:56.740]  So why not just say ex-Deep State operative tied and connected on an ongoing basis to the Deep State,
[3:53:56.740 --> 3:54:00.740]  who has sort of a Deep State ideological approach to the world.
[3:54:00.740 --> 3:54:03.740]  That would be a more accurate detail.
[3:54:03.740 --> 3:54:10.740]  But notice they don't tell you what the justice department position is and they don't tell you what the position in the intelligence community was.
[3:54:10.740 --> 3:54:18.740]  They just sort of make it sound like they're an authoritative source rather than someone who might have an institutional prejudice against the president.
[3:54:18.740 --> 3:54:24.740]  And described it as an incredibly big deal when there was actually nothing in the testimony at all that was an incredibly big deal.
[3:54:24.740 --> 3:54:31.740]  How do you know that? Because you keep going through the article and you keep trying to find them quoting the actual testimony.
[3:54:31.740 --> 3:54:34.740]  And basically there's very little of it.
[3:54:34.740 --> 3:54:37.740]  In fact you have to keep going. You still can't find the quoting of the testimony.
[3:54:37.740 --> 3:54:40.740]  You still can't find the quoting of the testimony.
[3:54:40.740 --> 3:54:43.740]  Almost no actual quotes of the testimony itself.
[3:54:43.740 --> 3:54:47.740]  And the reason for that is because the testimony itself doesn't support the proposition in the headline.
[3:54:47.740 --> 3:54:50.740]  So that's the sort of pattern of behavior you see from CNN.
[3:54:50.740 --> 3:55:00.740]  That was detailed that we now have seen the internal makings, the way the sausage is really made at CNN, by the whistleblower's disclosures and why it's so revelatory and significant.
[3:55:00.740 --> 3:55:13.740]  And it relates to what's coming, as Senator Grassley was talking about, being concerned about the FISA report coming from the Inspector General of the Attorney General's Office of the Department of Justice, Mr. Horowitz.
[3:55:13.740 --> 3:55:24.740]  So he's been investigating the ways in which the Department of Justice and the FBI and other officials related to their counterintelligence unit and counterespionage unit
[3:55:24.740 --> 3:55:36.740]  employed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which is popularly and colloquially known by its acronym of FISA, in the 2016 campaign and through early 2017.
[3:55:36.740 --> 3:55:48.740]  And so there's already concern by Senator Grassley that there's going to be an attempt to whitewash that report or to try to suppress the true impact of that report.
[3:55:48.740 --> 3:55:50.740]  And so that headline is out today.
[3:55:50.740 --> 3:55:55.740]  And the reason for the concern, you can find it on infowars.com and an article by Jamie White.
[3:55:55.740 --> 3:56:04.740]  And he said the Inspector General's upcoming report on potential FISA abuses by the FBI will likely be whitewashed by the very deep state forces it's set to expose.
[3:56:04.740 --> 3:56:13.740]  The reason why Senator Grassley has reason for concern is one of the problematic aspects is, despite making himself available, Carter Page,
[3:56:13.740 --> 3:56:22.740]  the primary person whose rights were abused by the misuse and abuse of FISA during the 2016 campaign and during part of 2017,
[3:56:22.740 --> 3:56:29.740]  continued while Mr. Trump was President of the United States and had already taken office, is because they have not interviewed him.
[3:56:29.740 --> 3:56:35.740]  Corwin's office has taken no action to talk to him, to get his perspective, to get his intel, to get his information.
[3:56:35.740 --> 3:56:44.740]  And while the Inspector General technically has simply focused on whether certain rules and procedures that govern the FBI and the Department of Justice were followed by these individuals,
[3:56:44.740 --> 3:56:57.740]  and so from that perspective would not need Carter Page's testimony, Carter Page's testimony would still be helpful as the victim of that process to show how incredulous the nature of what they did was.
[3:56:57.740 --> 3:57:08.740]  So that's why Senator Grassley is concerned. And it's probably not a coincidence that the fact that there's this combined effort to go after the President right on the eve of this FISA report
[3:57:08.740 --> 3:57:18.740]  and right when Ukraine has elected a reformist president who's investigating various roles of deep state corruption collusion during the Obama administration against President Trump,
[3:57:18.740 --> 3:57:31.740]  including weaponizing the State Department, weaponizing our intelligence apparatus, weaponizing our law enforcement apparatus to go after the President that there's now this impeachment effort.
[3:57:31.740 --> 3:57:38.740]  So the key firewall for the President is his public support and the support of people like you, but that doesn't make the threat any less real or any less potent.
[3:57:38.740 --> 3:57:47.740]  It's you who are the true defense. It's you who answered Paul Revere's call to defend America against this latest threat to its liberty and freedom.
[3:57:47.740 --> 3:57:51.740]  So come back to the next hour and we'll discuss more at inforce.com.
