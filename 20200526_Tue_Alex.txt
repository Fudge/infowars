[00:00.000 --> 00:19.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live on this May 26th Tuesday global transmission with
[00:19.040 --> 00:23.920]  exactly 160 days out from the incredibly important election.
[00:23.920 --> 00:28.960]  Well, it's come out that the New York Times put a bunch of fake names of people that died
[00:28.960 --> 00:35.840]  from gunshot wounds, car accidents in their list of 100,000 people that had died.
[00:35.840 --> 00:39.480]  And now Washington State's been caught doing it again, gunshot victims, countless coronavirus
[00:39.480 --> 00:41.480]  deaths in Washington State.
[00:41.480 --> 00:45.640]  The whole thing is a criminal fraud working in unison together and the whole facade starting
[00:45.640 --> 00:46.640]  to crumble.
[00:46.640 --> 00:52.320]  I'm talking about all the real numbers and real actuaries coming out of big banks and
[00:52.320 --> 00:59.720]  insurance companies in the United States, South Africa, Japan, Europe, showing that
[00:59.720 --> 01:06.200]  the lockdowns are a hoax and that COVID-19 is a hoax and that everyone dying of other
[01:06.200 --> 01:11.960]  diseases is counted as COVID-19 and is the biggest fraud the planet has ever seen.
[01:11.960 --> 01:17.680]  Over the course of the next few months and certainly the year, more people in the world
[01:17.680 --> 01:22.440]  will have died because of the lockdowns than because of the virus.
[01:22.440 --> 01:30.840]  And when you realize that there were no lockdowns in 1969, when 100,000 Americans died, and
[01:30.840 --> 01:35.240]  I remind you, much smaller population in the United States then.
[01:35.240 --> 01:39.040]  So that might be equivalent to perhaps 150,000 today.
[01:39.040 --> 01:40.680]  No lockdowns.
[01:40.680 --> 01:42.560]  We live in a different age.
[01:42.560 --> 01:45.760]  We do not value freedom because the left is in charge.
[01:45.760 --> 01:51.000]  The left has never valued freedom from Marx to the Democratic Party today.
[01:51.000 --> 01:53.680]  It is simply not, it's not one of their values.
[01:53.680 --> 01:55.120]  They may believe in equality.
[01:55.120 --> 01:59.440]  They may believe in government, but they do not believe in liberty.
[01:59.440 --> 02:07.680]  How many people on the left in their hearts value the idea as this is Memorial Day weekend
[02:07.680 --> 02:10.880]  that people died for liberty?
[02:10.880 --> 02:14.520]  We're not even prepared to live for liberty.
[02:14.520 --> 02:18.800]  Let's say this is the most serious crisis in American history since the Civil War.
[02:18.800 --> 02:25.120]  The neuroses and the mental illness that it's manifested is going to take generations to
[02:25.120 --> 02:29.080]  go away unless we all start speaking out against the hoax.
[02:29.080 --> 02:35.280]  Now there is a real virus that came out of a weapons lab and it has great gain of function
[02:35.280 --> 02:37.040]  so a lot of people get it.
[02:37.040 --> 02:40.400]  So you can all be suspect.
[02:40.400 --> 02:45.320]  And so that in tests it will match regular coronaviruses, one of the most common forms
[02:45.320 --> 02:49.280]  of death so they can create fear.
[02:49.280 --> 02:55.120]  It is a fear weapon, period.
[02:55.120 --> 03:01.760]  Supreme Court of Brazil has ordered a Bolsonaro video to be released from a private cabinet
[03:01.760 --> 03:07.080]  meeting he was having and it shows that he's just as real as we all knew he was.
[03:07.080 --> 03:13.960]  This broadcast and the feet and legs you gave it, we're in this together, has put Bolsonaro
[03:13.960 --> 03:17.640]  thanks to his incredible courage and that's brutally stabbed and survived.
[03:17.640 --> 03:22.160]  The guy is amazing and quite frankly I think more hardcore than Trump.
[03:22.160 --> 03:23.160]  Listen to this guy.
[03:23.160 --> 03:26.520]  It was decided not long ago that you couldn't handcuff almost no one.
[03:26.520 --> 03:31.720]  Why are they putting handcuffs on citizens that's working or a woman in a public square?
[03:31.720 --> 03:33.800]  You have to effing speak.
[03:33.800 --> 03:39.800]  People are going to be quiet until when or do I have to keep on exposing this myself?
[03:39.800 --> 03:40.800]  You have to speak.
[03:40.800 --> 03:41.800]  Put it out there.
[03:41.800 --> 03:42.800]  Dish it out.
[03:42.800 --> 03:46.600]  You can't put handcuffs, a decision on the Supreme Court itself.
[03:46.600 --> 03:48.680]  And we're going to be quiet until when?
[03:48.680 --> 03:53.040]  They keep on humiliating our people and that's growing.
[03:53.040 --> 03:54.240]  People keep on pointing at me.
[03:54.240 --> 03:59.080]  I voted on you for you to do something.
[03:59.080 --> 04:05.200]  I voted on you so you make decisions and it's true.
[04:05.200 --> 04:11.920]  I couldn't care less with the reelection and we have to think about that all of us.
[04:11.920 --> 04:15.960]  What these sons of bitches want is our freedom.
[04:15.960 --> 04:20.320]  Look, look how easy it is to impose a dictatorship in Brazil.
[04:20.320 --> 04:22.080]  How easy it is.
[04:22.080 --> 04:24.120]  Well here's the good news.
[04:24.120 --> 04:30.760]  We have judges in Illinois moving to override the unconstitutional continued lockdown order
[04:30.760 --> 04:33.760]  of the bureaucrats.
[04:33.760 --> 04:38.160]  We have Trump coming out on Friday and saying that he is saying the states are open and that
[04:38.160 --> 04:43.240]  religious services are essential or he will override the governors and that is a federal
[04:43.240 --> 04:46.080]  issue because it is the first amendment.
[04:46.080 --> 04:49.120]  That's how the first amendment begins for those that don't know.
[04:49.120 --> 04:52.320]  Congress should make no law respecting and establishing religion or prohibiting the free
[04:52.320 --> 04:56.680]  exercise thereof or embracing the freedom of speech or the press or the right of the
[04:56.680 --> 04:59.240]  people.
[04:59.240 --> 05:00.240]  Memorial Day is here.
[05:00.240 --> 05:04.640]  It's one of the biggest sales of the year and we were already running a huge sale but
[05:04.640 --> 05:07.440]  we're having to end that one because a bunch of items are selling out.
[05:07.440 --> 05:12.120]  But all the items we have left in stock are still on record sale and then five items that
[05:12.120 --> 05:16.240]  weren't on sale that we got back in stock, they're also massively discounted as well
[05:16.240 --> 05:17.960]  for the Memorial Day special.
[05:17.960 --> 05:23.760]  So here it is, super mail vitality, 40% off, knockout, the great sleep aid, 50% off, Brain
[05:23.760 --> 05:28.960]  Force Plus hadn't been on sale for almost six months, it is 50% off, Bio Jerusalemium,
[05:28.960 --> 05:34.960]  60% off, Shell Forge, it's incredible, 60% off and you've got all these other items on
[05:34.960 --> 05:37.320]  sale as well until they sell out.
[05:37.320 --> 05:44.320]  So infowarstore.com or AAA-253-3139 to get these items and take advantage of this mega
[05:44.320 --> 05:45.760]  sale Memorial Day.
[05:45.760 --> 05:47.560]  Again, thank you all for watching.
[05:47.560 --> 05:51.400]  We appreciate your support, your financial support, but it's also supported you and your
[05:51.400 --> 05:54.280]  family with amazing products that are so good for you and your body.
[05:54.280 --> 06:08.680]  Again, thank you all for your support, we are all in this together.
[06:08.680 --> 06:16.400]  We must declare war on the giant organized global government fraud that is COVID-19.
[06:16.400 --> 06:22.400]  We must tell every person we walk past in the street or to church or at work, everywhere
[06:22.400 --> 06:27.400]  we go from the grocery store to the five and dime to the gas station.
[06:27.400 --> 06:35.600]  We have to declare COVID-19 is a hoax, COVID-19 is medical tyranny, COVID-19 is permanent
[06:35.600 --> 06:42.880]  medical martial law, 160 days out from the election, the final countdown.
[06:42.880 --> 06:49.160]  Tuesday, May 26, 2020, I am your host, Alex Jones, we're going to be here for the next
[06:49.160 --> 06:50.160]  four hours.
[06:50.160 --> 06:54.160]  Paul Joseph Watson joins us, Max Kaiser, your calls.
[06:54.160 --> 06:58.680]  Then there's the war room, 3 to 6 p.m. with the great Owen Schreuer, of course, right
[06:58.680 --> 07:02.000]  before this transmission every day, David Knight and the David Knight show.
[07:02.000 --> 07:06.360]  You want real research, a lot of great documentation, David does a fabulous job.
[07:06.360 --> 07:11.720]  That is 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. central, okay.
[07:11.720 --> 07:17.280]  I know all of you know this, but we have over 200 radio affiliates and we have a lot of
[07:17.280 --> 07:22.920]  TV affiliates and there are new people tuning in every day.
[07:22.920 --> 07:27.440]  They hear us talk about things and they wonder, because they've heard the media say I'm a
[07:27.440 --> 07:29.760]  liar, is that really true?
[07:29.760 --> 07:34.680]  When I get up here and I say the original models from February financed in England and
[07:34.680 --> 07:39.080]  in the United States by Bill and Melinda Gates, the usual suspects, said that there'd
[07:39.080 --> 07:46.080]  be 2.2 million dead by now in the United States and 500 plus thousand dead by now in the United
[07:46.080 --> 07:47.880]  Kingdom.
[07:47.880 --> 07:53.440]  Of course, it's not anywhere near that.
[07:53.440 --> 07:58.560]  You could pull up those numbers for yourself, but let me just get an overhead shot here
[07:58.560 --> 08:03.080]  so I can give people the actual articles of the place to get it for themselves, because
[08:03.080 --> 08:08.800]  we're going to go over these numbers, because it's important to understand that the general
[08:08.800 --> 08:16.880]  public knows they're being lied to, but they don't know how severely, and so you have to
[08:16.880 --> 08:21.720]  show them the facts, and that's why we're creating a special section on Info Wars that
[08:21.720 --> 08:25.360]  has short little two-minute videos that will be done in about a week, and then just links
[08:25.360 --> 08:30.480]  to articles and links to graphs showing the bibliography to people so you can send it
[08:30.480 --> 08:31.680]  out to everyone you know.
[08:31.680 --> 08:37.280]  We're going to create a site that isn't banned yet, of course Info Wars is banned from being
[08:37.280 --> 08:43.800]  shared on many platforms, but you can still word of mouth share it, but this is the fight.
[08:43.800 --> 08:49.320]  Exposing this hoax, exposing this fraud, and exposing specifically how the fraud works
[08:49.320 --> 08:54.480]  is key, just like folks exposed that manmade global warming didn't exist, it was a giant
[08:54.480 --> 08:57.360]  global government carbon tax takeover.
[08:57.360 --> 09:02.840]  It took decades to defeat it, they spent hundreds of billions of dollars to push it, but it's
[09:02.840 --> 09:04.960]  dead on arrival.
[09:04.960 --> 09:12.240]  Well, this whole lockdown global government surveillance system was already being made
[09:12.240 --> 09:16.920]  attested by the Rockefellers, the Chai Coms, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation on record,
[09:16.920 --> 09:20.960]  with lockstep and of it 201 and the rest of them, and Bill Gates admits that, he calls
[09:20.960 --> 09:23.400]  this a drill on national TV now.
[09:23.400 --> 09:29.560]  He says, oh, this is the test, this isn't that bad, this is something a lot worse coming,
[09:29.560 --> 09:34.040]  bio weapons terrorists are going to release it.
[09:34.040 --> 09:38.560]  So this is all the marbles, it's the medical tyranny, it's always been that, the excuse
[09:38.560 --> 09:43.880]  for the surveillance, the excuse for the snitch groups, the excuse for the forced inoculations,
[09:43.880 --> 09:48.240]  it's the whole enchilada, and that digital database proving you've been given all your
[09:48.240 --> 09:54.640]  inoculations will be used as the global currency, and that's all official as well, and your
[09:54.640 --> 09:59.640]  medical subservience, your medical slavery, submitting your body to the state and these
[09:59.640 --> 10:06.440]  mega corporations, and the UN is your religious sacrament, you don't take the blood of Christ,
[10:06.440 --> 10:12.280]  the body of Christ, you take the Bill and Melinda Gates seed into your body, and we've
[10:12.280 --> 10:17.280]  got amazing deep research on that today, we'll be getting into as well, but let's just look
[10:17.280 --> 10:22.200]  at a smattering of these articles, that'll get to the really big news, Imperial College
[10:22.200 --> 10:33.840]  Scientist who predicted 500,000 dead from Coronavirus in UK, a just figure to 20K, confusion
[10:33.840 --> 10:40.520]  in Imperial College Scientist 500,000 Coronavirus deaths projection, White House takes aim after
[10:40.520 --> 10:47.920]  dire report on death toll, they said it'd be 2.2 million, but it wasn't, it's 100,000,
[10:47.920 --> 10:54.640]  that's totally inflated, epidemiologists behind highly cited Coronavirus model drastically
[10:54.640 --> 11:02.640]  downgrades projection, how one model simulated 2.2 million US deaths from COVID-19, Kato.org,
[11:02.640 --> 11:07.280]  it's all right there, but let's look at the new stuff today, because you know they only
[11:07.280 --> 11:14.120]  did it 10 to 1, 15 to 1, 20 to 1 on these models here in the United States and the UK, in places
[11:14.120 --> 11:20.400]  like Sweden and Germany, they had it 40 to 1, 50 to 1 the death toll, same thing in Brazil,
[11:20.400 --> 11:27.400]  they were saying a million are gonna die, last time I checked it's like 30,000, and again
[11:27.400 --> 11:32.880]  globally their standardized healthcare systems and insurance companies are global, and so
[11:32.880 --> 11:38.240]  if you say someone died of COVID-19, you get way more money, that's on record, in the United
[11:38.240 --> 11:42.640]  States it's almost $14,000 to say you have a COVID patient period in the building, just
[11:42.640 --> 11:49.760]  pure cash on you, upfront, then if you stick a tube down their throat and intubate them,
[11:49.760 --> 11:59.200]  that's an extra 39 smackers, 39 grand, and then it just gravy trains on from there, gravy
[11:59.200 --> 12:05.120]  trains, and here's what's incredible, they're not even trying to hide any of this now, but
[12:05.120 --> 12:11.160]  let's get to the new big ones, you've seen the meme that oh yeah, a great white shark
[12:11.160 --> 12:17.080]  attacked a lady and they called it COVID-19, that meme is a joke, but where it comes from
[12:17.080 --> 12:22.560]  isn't, this is just in the news today, at nationalfile.com, we're gonna post this article
[12:22.560 --> 12:29.160]  on infowars.com, gunshot victims count as coronavirus deaths in Washington state, this
[12:29.160 --> 12:35.360]  is some real original reporting, Freedom Foundation reports did a Freedom Information
[12:35.360 --> 12:44.480]  Act request and they admitted gunshot wounds, car wrecks, suicides, and then they test you
[12:44.480 --> 12:51.560]  with the Bill and Melinda Gates U.N. testing kit that the FDA shut down for fraud, and
[12:51.560 --> 12:57.120]  the kit finds almost everyone is positive if you've had the flu or a coronavirus on
[12:57.120 --> 13:01.400]  average the last decade, so they say get the vaccines every decade or so, quote immunity
[13:01.400 --> 13:04.680]  goes well, and that's pretty accurate, but if you've had a cold virus, if you've had
[13:04.680 --> 13:09.520]  a flu virus, you have the detritus in your body from that fight, you have the wreckage
[13:09.520 --> 13:14.560]  of it, not the antibodies, just the genetic wreckage, and so everyone that's had a cold
[13:14.560 --> 13:20.960]  or the flu in the last 10 years, baby, you got corona, and that's only one type of test,
[13:20.960 --> 13:24.440]  and I told you it was a fraud, and now it's come out that Bill and Melinda Gates are financing
[13:24.440 --> 13:31.000]  the main test, and it's a damn fraud, not approved and a damn fraud, but that's only
[13:31.000 --> 13:34.920]  one level to the juiciness, ladies and gentlemen.
[13:34.920 --> 13:41.800]  Look at this article, gunshot victims count as coronavirus deaths in Washington state,
[13:41.800 --> 13:50.600]  and it goes over the entire thing, unbelievable, here's another one, New York Times, US deaths
[13:50.600 --> 13:56.760]  near 100,000, it's just last Friday, at an incalculable loss, sixth name on New York
[13:56.760 --> 14:04.320]  Times list, just six in of coronavirus victims, a 27-year-old man who was murdered, murdered
[14:04.320 --> 14:12.000]  when you get stabbed, when you get shot, you are a COVID-19 death, ladies and gentlemen,
[14:12.000 --> 14:19.480]  this is all happening, this is how dumb they think you are, how suggestible, and that's
[14:19.480 --> 14:29.480]  why 80% in the United States of COVID-19 deaths are over the age of 85, looking up for yourself,
[14:29.480 --> 14:32.800]  it's the same thing in Europe, it's the same thing everywhere, because it's a fraud, you
[14:32.800 --> 14:37.880]  die when you've got all these other diseases, and kidney failure, and liver failure, and
[14:37.880 --> 14:42.840]  lung cancer, and bone cancer, and brain cancer, and they come in and stick a test in you that's
[14:42.840 --> 14:47.760]  designed to be a fraud when you croak, and they say it's COVID so you can scare the
[14:47.760 --> 14:52.720]  living daylights out of the public, and I know all of you know this, so I'm going to
[14:52.720 --> 15:00.240]  say this, we'll post the clip from this show today, we're building a site that shows all
[15:00.240 --> 15:03.080]  the facts, so folks that have to look it up for themselves, they can just click right
[15:03.080 --> 15:09.120]  there, we're making it easy, but do you understand, when we come back, what they're going to do,
[15:09.120 --> 15:12.440]  they're going to have another lockdown around the election, it's never going to end, it
[15:12.440 --> 15:17.720]  makes the UN the boss, it's meant to devastate the first world economy, China is exempting
[15:17.720 --> 15:21.320]  themselves, says they're over it, they're not going to have more lockdowns, this is
[15:21.320 --> 15:27.120]  a fraudulent takeover, this is an economic warfare operation, and the Pentagon has come
[15:27.120 --> 15:33.120]  out and said that this is China's Chernobyl, and that China covered it up to deliberately
[15:33.120 --> 15:38.120]  hurt us, it's worse than that, they released the damn thing, you've got top scientists
[15:38.120 --> 15:45.440]  in Australia, in India, in Germany, in the US, in France, in Canada, all coming out,
[15:45.440 --> 15:51.680]  and the virus, they said, this thing is so man-made, it's ridiculous, people don't know
[15:51.680 --> 15:56.280]  that you can't have it both ways, Alex, yes you can, it's man-made, I'll tell you why
[15:56.280 --> 16:00.800]  when we come back, it took hundreds and hundreds of years of human civilization to build up
[16:00.800 --> 16:07.680]  the world economy to where it is, every economist is on record saying that as this economy has
[16:07.680 --> 16:11.960]  been shut down for two months, it is going to be a death sentence to the third world,
[16:11.960 --> 16:16.680]  and a horrible nightmarish collapse for the first world, and that the general public is
[16:16.680 --> 16:21.160]  going to go into deep, deep debt to the mega banks, they're not going to have medical ID
[16:21.160 --> 16:28.120]  cards, force inoculations, we are now in a giant dystopia, but a lot of people are waking
[16:28.120 --> 16:34.640]  up and there is a major backlash taking place against this tyranny, and we must all rediscover
[16:34.640 --> 16:40.440]  our bill of rights, rediscover our constitution and our backbone, and start saying no to people
[16:40.440 --> 16:44.640]  who take this moral high ground and say shut your business down, shut your life down, it
[16:44.640 --> 16:49.400]  will save lives, no, it's caused millions to already starve to death, tens of millions
[16:49.400 --> 16:53.720]  more, so the cowards who went along with this with your virtues signaling, you have destroyed
[16:53.720 --> 16:56.400]  your lives and our lives, congratulations.
[16:56.400 --> 17:01.880]  Feudalism in the ancient world from Asia to Europe from Africa to Latin America was the
[17:01.880 --> 17:07.640]  most common form of government, you had a ruling class, the nobility, the king and queen sitting
[17:07.640 --> 17:13.480]  on top of it, and the rest of the public were kept at a subsistence, starving level for
[17:13.480 --> 17:18.480]  control, in fact in most cultures they call the peasants the little people, because they
[17:18.480 --> 17:23.880]  were usually a foot or more shorter than the lords and ladies, because they kept them
[17:23.880 --> 17:29.600]  again at a starving level, they were so busy trying to survive, they would never try to
[17:29.600 --> 17:34.000]  challenge the entrenched elite, well now all the big Google owners and the Rockefellers
[17:34.000 --> 17:38.400]  and the Rothschilds, the Jeff Bezos is the world, they're sitting back on their giant
[17:38.400 --> 17:44.920]  estates with their jet helicopters and private jets living the life, laughing at you, shut
[17:44.920 --> 17:51.240]  down, going bankrupt in the third world starving to death, their religion is power and control
[17:51.240 --> 18:00.560]  and they are pressing that advantage against us, we must break free from these monsters.
[18:00.560 --> 18:11.400]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:11.400 --> 18:30.200]  This is the end, beautiful prayer, this is the end, my only friend, the end, of our
[18:30.200 --> 18:41.440]  love replies, the end, of everything that stands, the end, we are back live, broadcasting
[18:41.440 --> 18:46.480]  worldwide, I'm your host Alex Jones, okay so I'm just going to restate this because
[18:46.480 --> 18:51.600]  this is the entire shooting match, it's the entire spectrum of what we're dealing with
[18:51.600 --> 19:01.360]  as a society and as a culture, every facet of the COVID-19 rollout was scripted and battle
[19:01.360 --> 19:05.200]  planned and prepared by the most powerful globalist foundations and corporations on
[19:05.200 --> 19:19.720]  earth publicly, every facet of it has been a giant premeditated complete and total lie
[19:19.720 --> 19:24.800]  and the agenda of where it's taking us is a true dystopia, you already noticed that
[19:24.800 --> 19:32.680]  just 73 days into the forced police state lockdown in some areas of Europe, they're
[19:32.680 --> 19:41.000]  into month number four and a half, you notice it just gets worse and worse and worse and
[19:41.000 --> 19:48.440]  worse and the more we submit, the more they squeeze to see what they can get out of you
[19:48.440 --> 19:54.280]  because they're trying to erase thousands of years of progress of humans standing up
[19:54.280 --> 19:59.840]  in demanding liberty and paying for it in blood and in treasure and in time and in everything
[19:59.840 --> 20:18.120]  else, so that's what we face as a culture and as a society and as a planet
[20:18.120 --> 20:23.880]  and we can sit here and let these criminal liars get away with what they're doing or
[20:23.880 --> 20:37.240]  we can stand up to them, every grocery store I go in, every gas station I go into, every
[20:37.240 --> 20:41.560]  restaurant I go into now, the theory open partially, when the waitress walks up I say
[20:41.560 --> 20:44.880]  you can take that mask off, well we were ordered to and I say but you know they're counting
[20:44.880 --> 20:50.440]  every death, car wrecks, gunshot wounds, people that had cancer as COVID-19, they're like
[20:50.440 --> 21:00.360]  yeah I heard that and most people are actually somewhat informed
[21:00.360 --> 21:04.360]  and most people I talk to actually already know all this and then I say to them I say
[21:04.360 --> 21:11.320]  then you need to tell other people, you need to let them know it's a fraud and this female
[21:11.320 --> 21:15.880]  waitress was sitting there yesterday and she said you're right I need to and her and the
[21:15.880 --> 21:24.240]  manager and the other person took their mask off and said this is all just a giant hoax
[21:24.240 --> 21:29.000]  and then I sat there and exchanged phone numbers with her and said I'm going to send you articles
[21:29.000 --> 21:36.840]  and documentation and I did and I wasn't hitting on her even though she was attractive.
[21:36.840 --> 21:41.000]  That's what it's going to take to beat these people is just simple selling the truth, selling
[21:41.000 --> 21:48.600]  the truth and look I've been doing this full time for like two months since the mask went
[21:48.600 --> 21:55.640]  on in Texas and all the hysteria and all the the garbage I have been talking to hiking
[21:55.640 --> 21:59.600]  bike trail somebody goes like this and gets back from me I start talking to them very
[21:59.600 --> 22:04.120]  nicely but laying out the facts and you'll find that most people were just going along
[22:04.120 --> 22:07.880]  with it because they think it's peer pressure and what they're supposed to do others think
[22:07.880 --> 22:12.120]  they're heroes because they're buying into it and what they're buying into is the total
[22:12.120 --> 22:19.320]  destruction of civilization and society.
[22:19.320 --> 22:24.880]  The take down of the free market capitalist civilization because the globalists have decided
[22:24.880 --> 22:30.480]  they want to not just a post human world a post industrial world and so this is economic
[22:30.480 --> 22:36.160]  warfare and they scripted like oh your heroes you know not opening your company oh your
[22:36.160 --> 22:40.960]  heroes getting that welfare check oh your heroes were in that mask oh you're such heroes
[22:40.960 --> 22:47.520]  and really you're buying into a giant premeditated fraud now people say to me now wait a minute
[22:47.520 --> 22:53.520]  you first said with experts back in late January that COVID-19 was a man made bio weapon out
[22:53.520 --> 22:59.600]  of the Wuhan bio weapon lab well if it's so deadly it's a bio weapon no no it's a psychological
[22:59.600 --> 23:07.640]  weapon but you need to have again a cold virus that's man made so you can finally own it
[23:07.640 --> 23:14.480]  and finally have an artificial mutation whose baby mutations you've already tested in labs
[23:14.480 --> 23:22.040]  in tissue cultures so that it stays around a long time and so you can own it and make
[23:22.040 --> 23:28.000]  money off of it and have tests that find it in everyone so it has incredible gain of function
[23:28.000 --> 23:33.800]  two different main varieties as you know hundreds of sub varieties of each but one is very easy
[23:33.800 --> 23:41.600]  to catch but isn't very harmful one does have you know a high kill rate for a respiratory
[23:41.600 --> 23:47.680]  cold it's nasty but there's a lot of nasty stuff and it's hard to get they they engineered
[23:47.680 --> 23:53.200]  all that and it's come out how they engineered it and they had documentaries 2015 in Wuhan
[23:53.200 --> 24:00.960]  bragging for Italian TV how they were testing weaponized chimeras of the coronavirus family
[24:00.960 --> 24:06.320]  on humans so we knew they were lying about it we knew the NIH funded it we knew Obama
[24:06.320 --> 24:13.280]  did it we knew it was man made there was a major controversy five years ago and so yes
[24:13.280 --> 24:19.360]  ladies and gentlemen we have to expose these monsters because the very people that engineered
[24:19.360 --> 24:27.040]  it all are the ones now posing as our savers and we have to understand we are under the
[24:27.040 --> 24:32.200]  gun by predators these really are evil people and I know I don't want to admit it you don't
[24:32.200 --> 24:37.720]  want to admit it my gosh I've been really upset more than I've ever been knowing all
[24:37.720 --> 24:42.560]  this to actually see the trap shut it's like you're telling your kid hey watch out that's
[24:42.560 --> 24:46.480]  a bear trap over there they don't listen step it and it clangs on their leg and almost chops
[24:46.480 --> 24:49.840]  it off you're trying to get the bear trap off do you feel good that you were right
[24:49.840 --> 24:53.840]  and your six year old walked over and stepped at the bear trap no you're not happy that you
[24:53.840 --> 25:01.360]  that the damn thing shut on our collective leg but it did now we got the bear trap on our leg
[25:02.080 --> 25:08.240]  and seeing it's telling you it's mama giving you a kiss on the cheek it ain't and so people better
[25:08.240 --> 25:13.200]  get pissed and we better get this damn thing off our leg and let me tell you it's gonna hurt
[25:13.200 --> 25:18.640]  but you know what the bear traps for right it's to hold you down
[25:21.520 --> 25:29.280]  so that when they come to kill the bear you can't get away you're being put on lockdown
[25:29.280 --> 25:34.080]  you're being put on house arrest I'm being put on lockdown you're being held hostage
[25:34.080 --> 25:41.360]  you're getting bitch slapped you're getting taught who your daddy is you're getting taught that all
[25:41.360 --> 25:44.800]  the tracking stuff they already had in place is something you got to accept and you're getting
[25:44.800 --> 25:49.840]  told that all these unemployed people are going to be new snitches oh in this new international
[25:49.840 --> 25:55.600]  program that the UN runs with the health services becoming the global government
[25:56.800 --> 26:01.520]  if hitler came in lab coats we'd have laid down to him and said yes sir howl hitler
[26:02.080 --> 26:06.080]  if you wore a pink uniform we would have bowed to him but he didn't he came with tanks and
[26:06.080 --> 26:12.560]  airplanes and so we said oh you're going to kick our ass we'll kick your ass because it was out in
[26:12.560 --> 26:17.040]  the open but if he'd have been a convicted pedophile and said I just want to love your
[26:17.040 --> 26:22.720]  children and groom them and the school said so you'd sit right on hitlers lab wouldn't you
[26:22.720 --> 26:26.400]  because we've all been tested and prepared and when they said look they'll even let convicted
[26:26.400 --> 26:30.720]  pedophiles have their way with their children on tv and literally hump kids on tv they said
[26:30.720 --> 26:35.840]  then launched the attack these people have put up and they're going to take everything you've got
[26:35.840 --> 26:42.800]  submission to this is death it's humiliation it's slavery it's everything under the sun
[26:42.800 --> 26:50.480]  info wars dot com news wars dot com tomorrow's news today tomorrow's news today you are the
[26:50.480 --> 26:55.840]  paul reveres however you're listening tell folks to tune in now now you are the resistance the
[26:55.840 --> 27:03.120]  lockdown is permanent dictatorship the lockdown is designed to have the public accept their basic
[27:03.120 --> 27:10.720]  rights being suspended and a global medical tyranny led by the who and the bill malin the gates
[27:10.720 --> 27:18.080]  foundation in full control many will submit through fear others will be bought off but in the end
[27:18.720 --> 27:24.880]  the globalists admit they're building a post human world and now that we're inside the cage
[27:24.880 --> 27:32.480]  it's going to move very very quickly into its in game submission to this is a form of living death
[27:33.040 --> 27:40.320]  and committing the next generation and our own generation to a living hell that cannot be imagined
[27:40.320 --> 27:46.400]  until you're actually experiencing this this is your dignity your soul your future being poured
[27:46.400 --> 27:52.800]  inside out this is a scientific dictatorship taking full control of humanity for its own
[27:52.800 --> 28:01.280]  selfless disgusting power trip we are 170 days out from the 2020 election it is a referendum of
[28:01.280 --> 28:06.800]  national sovereignty against globalism and obama hillary and the deep state have been caught

[28:23.040 --> 28:28.640]  globalist attempt to punish the american people wreck our economy and hope that we won't recognize
[28:28.640 --> 28:33.920]  that it is they the new world order that have orchestrated this and not president trump they
[28:33.920 --> 28:39.040]  know their crimes are coming out they know the chickens are coming home to roost so now they're

[28:44.720 --> 28:52.160]  safe from covet 19 the entire covet 19 system is a giant hoax and must be exposed if america has

[29:52.480 --> 30:08.400]  time at infowarstore.com you're listening to the alex jones show
[30:23.120 --> 30:40.000]  well if you want to be free you should run away from submission you should fight back in any way
[30:40.000 --> 30:46.400]  you can because submission to the whole covet 19 billable indicates un rollout is the end of human
[30:46.400 --> 30:56.960]  freedom as we know it all right let me do this let me show you the face of true fascism
[30:58.160 --> 31:02.640]  and true authoritarianism this is footage from this weekend out of statin island new york
[31:04.000 --> 31:11.600]  where a woman is not wearing her burqa mask of submission and so a mob of men and women begin
[31:11.600 --> 31:17.600]  screaming and cussing at her and run her out of the store leftist on twitter celebrated it said
[31:17.600 --> 31:22.400]  she deserved to be beaten in the head because she is a criminal she's a potential carrier
[31:22.400 --> 31:28.800]  she's a murderer you know we're all suspects now we're all guilty until vaccinated however many
[31:28.800 --> 31:34.640]  times bill gates wants we're all guilty until sterilized not innocent until proven guilty
[31:34.640 --> 31:43.680]  guilty until vaccinated until dead here's that video
[31:43.680 --> 31:50.720]  so
[32:02.320 --> 32:08.560]  and so you got full grown men thugging out strutting around yelling at a woman
[32:08.560 --> 32:18.320]  and again that's new york run by criminals so hardcore that they have more deaths than any
[32:18.320 --> 32:28.240]  other large group of states can bind because it's all fraud but it gets worse we're gonna play this
[32:28.240 --> 32:33.040]  footage here in a moment update black man caught on video beating elderly nursing home patient was
[32:33.040 --> 32:41.360]  arrested after hero tom fenton from judicial watch alerts authorities it has to be a national
[32:41.360 --> 32:48.080]  watchdog that even cares to go find out and do something and it turns out that individual that
[32:48.080 --> 32:51.200]  was there beating up the old people we're gonna play it with audio here in a moment
[32:53.600 --> 33:00.320]  he was put there because he tested positive for covet 19 he was asymptomatic got tested
[33:00.320 --> 33:11.120]  and sent as a cash cow welfare bonanza reportedly by his family and didn't even work in the facility
[33:13.520 --> 33:20.960]  now think about that you you have covet 19 and so you send people young people into a nursing home
[33:20.960 --> 33:25.760]  to then infect them and this is another democrat plan because if you've got almost dead people
[33:25.760 --> 33:31.920]  and you give them pneumonia you can up that number and then they get to intubate everybody
[33:32.640 --> 33:39.680]  and so that's why in new york in michigan in california in origan in washington state
[33:40.560 --> 33:49.600]  in minnesota all the democrat rat nest new jersey they're on record shipping young people
[33:49.600 --> 33:56.960]  into nursing homes and saying nursing homes are where covet patients go meanwhile the hospitals
[33:56.960 --> 34:04.320]  are empty and the heroes at the nursing homes well the most abusive industries on record some are
[34:04.320 --> 34:07.280]  good some are bad i know folks that have worked in nursing homes physical therapists that are
[34:07.280 --> 34:11.440]  wonderful angels there are plenty of evil people in there as everybody knows you get very callous in
[34:11.440 --> 34:19.520]  there and so oh if the whole nursing home gets covet 19 that's third that's 13 000 smackers per person
[34:19.520 --> 34:26.080]  and then lordy lordy lordy when a bunch of the Alzheimer's patients that are 90 years old on
[34:26.080 --> 34:32.080]  average when they get that covet they said the un set the standards snake a tube down their throat
[34:32.080 --> 34:47.600]  intubate them 39 000 sweetsies but you got to put the poison in so it's hard to get people already
[34:47.600 --> 34:52.640]  nursing homes sick so you find people in the community that have it you get them tested
[34:53.360 --> 34:58.720]  and then you ship that weapon like like the british troops given the native americans smallpox
[34:58.720 --> 35:05.600]  blankets that had smallpox on it you just give it to them and then you get all that cash and it
[35:05.600 --> 35:09.120]  doesn't matter if it's europe it doesn't matter if it's the united states it matter if it's australia
[35:09.120 --> 35:14.720]  the un set the scam the big insurance actuaries and they paid it all out and they were running that
[35:14.720 --> 35:22.320]  like a football play right up the middle on us and now
[35:22.320 --> 35:24.320]  now
[35:26.960 --> 35:32.720]  they're within striking distance of a major touchdown because everybody wants to be genteel
[35:32.720 --> 35:38.640]  and it's a form of elegance and a form of manliness and a form of heroicness to wear the mask and
[35:38.640 --> 35:45.280]  stand back and get all scared and talk about how we live through it we survived it and meanwhile
[35:45.280 --> 35:54.160]  a giant criminal conspiracy actuary prepared battle plans scripted blueprinted wargamed
[35:55.440 --> 36:01.520]  was set up at the un years ago wargamed again last october in november with bill
[36:01.520 --> 36:07.920]  monday gates captaining it generaling it field marshaling it and then they launched the whole
[36:08.480 --> 36:15.120]  giant sickening enchilada and even us say today did a fact check a month ago and said
[36:15.120 --> 36:22.640]  it's actually true they get 13,000 and 39,000 and then a bunch of other money for the covet
[36:22.640 --> 36:26.640]  patients fact can we put that us today back on screen for you viewers just take them to the
[36:26.640 --> 36:35.200]  bottom where it says claim is true yeah just go to the bottom that's right a little bit quicker
[36:36.240 --> 36:39.440]  we'll just mosey on down that little juicy down there for yet

[36:56.320 --> 37:03.680]  oh it's so much fun to scam everyone then say that people like me that say vitamin d3 and zinc
[37:03.680 --> 37:09.120]  and vitamin c are essential and then if you don't have those the virus can get in and replicate
[37:09.120 --> 37:12.800]  and that's why people starving to death all the time die of the common cold and that's all
[37:12.800 --> 37:20.400]  scientific historic absolute fact and they're calling for my arrest all over the news everybody
[37:20.400 --> 37:25.440]  else's arrest and they're swat teaming with guys with mp5's get it get it going doctors facilities

[37:47.760 --> 38:00.160]  shut up because we're going to put an engineered cold virus out that we own and we're gonna kill
[38:00.160 --> 38:04.960]  a bunch of people and a bunch of people that didn't die that died in car wrecks and gunshot wounds
[38:04.960 --> 38:16.880]  and stabbings and cancer and heart attacks and dog bites we're gonna count them all it's covid 19
[38:16.880 --> 38:23.920]  baby look at these articles gunshot victims count as coronavirus deaths in washington state
[38:25.280 --> 38:30.800]  six name on new york times list of coronavirus victims is 27 year old man who was murdered
[38:30.800 --> 38:37.040]  then you go deeper in the whole list it's just full of people but i mean they'll put you on the list
[38:38.640 --> 38:44.560]  if you died in a car wreck or a gunshot wound and here's another one gunshot victims count
[38:44.560 --> 38:49.360]  as coronavirus death in washington state this is just today's news imperial college said 500
[38:49.360 --> 38:57.280]  thousand died nothing even near it they said two plus million the us nothing even near it and all
[38:57.280 --> 39:03.200]  of that is salted all of that is filled with crap all of that is lies and the very criminals that
[39:03.200 --> 39:08.480]  run the wuhan lab and obama and fouchy it's their next coup russia gate didn't work
[39:09.040 --> 39:14.400]  ukraine gate didn't work race war didn't work crash the economy though they think it worked
[39:14.400 --> 39:18.720]  and that's what they're betting on and bernie sanders and bidener all sandage trumps fault
[39:19.360 --> 39:23.200]  when they're the ones that ran the whole damn show and you know what if we're stupid enough to go
[39:23.200 --> 39:27.440]  along with this and not spread the word that we deserve it here's the bad news we come back there's
[39:27.440 --> 39:35.360]  some goodness people are waking up the bad news is the bad news is the ai's now in place and i've
[39:35.360 --> 39:39.360]  got the reports flooding in all confirmed fact i got another one just a minute ago and all no
[39:39.360 --> 39:45.760]  national talk show host sent me that i need to remind the crew to get pulled up this is unbelievable
[39:45.760 --> 39:49.440]  when we come back the bad news because that means we can beat them though we got to admit to the bad
[39:49.440 --> 39:57.360]  that don't how to whoop its ass we'll be right back the panic that has been orchestrated by the
[39:57.360 --> 40:04.480]  global corporatist media and the chai comms is going to now trigger a worldwide depression in fact
[40:04.480 --> 40:09.120]  we're already into the worldwide depression in the death sentence for the third world but it's
[40:09.120 --> 40:16.000]  critical to understand that the longer the shutdown persists the worse it's going to be a month of
[40:16.000 --> 40:21.760]  shutdown will destroy decades of wealth that's been built up in a complex economy that's what we've
[40:21.760 --> 40:26.480]  always said it's important to be a prepper and to be somewhat self-sufficient because the globalists
[40:26.480 --> 40:32.720]  want to make us all dependent so that we're under their control they've admitted all of this so
[40:32.720 --> 40:38.720]  remember how does info wars continue years and decades in many cases to be able to predict
[40:38.720 --> 40:44.240]  things before they happen because we're following the globalist blueprint and their battle plan
[40:44.240 --> 40:49.360]  and yes it's dystopia and yes it's scary but denying it and letting them carry it out is a
[40:49.360 --> 40:54.800]  thousand times more scary it's time to stop the denial and realize what's really happening now
[40:54.800 --> 41:00.960]  it's official the united nations came out yesterday and said the covid emergency will last five years
[41:01.520 --> 41:07.200]  and the uk government said you must all carry cell phones outside or you'll be arrested because we
[41:07.200 --> 41:12.560]  have to track your social distancing and you're only allowed to have a list of 10 people that you
[41:12.560 --> 41:19.520]  visit and if you go outside that list of 10 you'll be permanently detained yes ladies and gentlemen
[41:19.520 --> 41:24.560]  this is the new world order where they let the criminals out of jail the rapists the child molesters
[41:24.560 --> 41:30.960]  the murderers and where you are now non-essential and a prisoner from the beginning of my research
[41:30.960 --> 41:36.720]  it was clear the globalists are an authoritarian anti-human group they have to put this electronic
[41:36.720 --> 41:42.800]  straightjacket on us before they carry out their in game which is global depopulation so you see
[41:43.360 --> 41:50.000]  submitting to them is death the only way to stop them is to expose them to hate their guts and
[41:50.000 --> 41:58.560]  realize they are humanity's mortal enemy wake up or die what info wars has been able to do
[41:58.560 --> 42:04.000]  thanks to your support and your prayers and your word of mouth has been nothing short of historic
[42:04.000 --> 42:12.480]  and truly epic this is the battle for the future of humanity and now open world government is being
[42:12.480 --> 42:20.640]  established with an end game to depopulate the planet now the internal operations of the globalists
[42:20.640 --> 42:27.120]  are being externalized you must decide which side you're on living in denial having mast
[42:27.120 --> 42:33.520]  Stockholm syndrome learned helplessness will only deliver you into misery destruction and finally
[42:33.520 --> 42:39.760]  death and this is a spiritual death we're talking about not just a physical death the delusions
[42:39.760 --> 42:46.320]  must end now info wars was correct about it all and we have come so far by exposing the enemy
[42:46.880 --> 42:50.000]  most people that are aware of the new world order decide to join it out of fear
[42:50.000 --> 43:00.160]  they are truly fools we must fight this or lose our souls we're living in insanely dangerous times
[43:00.160 --> 43:04.640]  and i've told folks going back three months ago i'm not buying storable food because i'm
[43:04.640 --> 43:09.040]  worried about the covid-19 virus i'm worried about the food shortages and the economic collapse and
[43:09.040 --> 43:13.600]  now it's admitted that a chain reaction has begun that's already caused food shortages and the
[43:13.600 --> 43:17.920]  collapse of farms and ranches across the united states and it's even worse in the third world so
[43:17.920 --> 43:22.720]  i hope trump with his initiatives can clean this up and fix it but with the election fraud and the
[43:22.720 --> 43:27.280]  covid-19 all the wars and the third world collapsing and everything else is going on
[43:27.280 --> 43:32.880]  now is the time to get storeable foods because they'll last for 25 years they're in easily totable
[43:32.880 --> 43:37.520]  bags it's high quality food and it's good to have that box checked off to be ready and it funds the
[43:37.520 --> 43:42.320]  info war so we have storeable food available again infowarstore.com or call toll free triple A
[43:42.320 --> 43:47.520]  253-313-9 whatever you do get prepared and get ready because the globalists want you dependent

[43:52.800 --> 44:04.880]  now while you still can you're listening to the alex jones show
[44:04.880 --> 44:15.520]  all right we are back live and i'm really doing my best here not going into a rage on air because
[44:19.760 --> 44:26.160]  how we treat old people and how we treat children how we treat babies is who we are and
[44:26.160 --> 44:36.000]  um i have confirmed it's public it's all over the damn news but we knew this a few months ago
[44:36.560 --> 44:40.080]  and media matters made jokes about it oh jones claims are killing old people in the nursing
[44:40.080 --> 44:45.280]  home is bringing in covid patients on purpose think about your default being covering up evil
[44:45.280 --> 44:51.040]  and liking it and thinking it's cute and funny and bill gates up there about yeah we gotta get
[44:51.040 --> 44:57.200]  rid of the old people oh you didn't get rid of your 95-year-old dad you got a nursing home that's got
[44:58.720 --> 45:04.400]  in some private palace oh that useful senior he didn't go anywhere
[45:08.160 --> 45:12.720]  you better believe they're not taking covid-19 patients and sticking it next to bill gates senior
[45:17.520 --> 45:20.400]  and when you study evil how these big corporations that they're like bean
[45:20.400 --> 45:23.920]  counters and figure out a whole plan they go to these big global councils they all
[45:24.800 --> 45:31.520]  vote and decide on what the best scam is but helps all of their organizations and you got
[45:31.520 --> 45:37.360]  covid-19 because it helps the global government the digital tattoo of the surveillance state
[45:37.360 --> 45:45.440]  the tattletale state the medical tyranny the forced inoculations the global government
[45:45.440 --> 45:54.960]  so the un runs it i mean i turn on local news radio tv newspaper it is just the un is beyond
[45:54.960 --> 46:03.680]  platinum man i used to hear the pope spoke from the throne ex-cathedra well when it comes out of
[46:03.680 --> 46:08.960]  the mouth of the who man it's like it came out of jesus's mouth according to these people
[46:08.960 --> 46:17.520]  and then everything that comes out of their mouth is a corrupt lying fraud
[46:18.320 --> 46:22.960]  allied with the most murderous regimes the planet has ever seen
[46:25.440 --> 46:29.360]  and man i i mean i look at that governor up there that on purpose since people infected
[46:29.360 --> 46:33.920]  the nursing homes i mean that's like the default thing you don't do like don't throw a new york
[46:33.920 --> 46:39.120]  newborn baby in the deep end of the pool and she's got the baby throwing it right in the pool it's
[46:39.120 --> 46:44.960]  like don't go to fireworks factory with a flamethrower lit or don't pour gasoline on yourself and light
[46:44.960 --> 46:51.040]  it don't jump in the backyard with 15 starving pit bulls don't go to the local zoo and climb in
[46:51.040 --> 46:58.400]  the bingo tiger cage i mean don't take a bottle of cyanide don't chop your dick off excuse me but
[46:58.400 --> 47:07.680]  that this is ridiculous the default position is keep infectious patients away from the nursing
[47:07.680 --> 47:14.720]  homes and democrats in unison and globalists from europe to australia to the united states ship them
[47:14.720 --> 47:24.160]  in there to call their asses bunch of murder and scum see what they can get away with you're
[47:24.160 --> 47:28.240]  like well maybe they're just stupid that's why they run their mouth about killing old people

[57:11.680 --> 57:19.440]  of the info war all right folks i've been wanting to release that for about two months on air and i
[57:19.440 --> 57:26.880]  just went ahead and went ahead and was honest with you this we're being suffocated we're being
[57:26.880 --> 57:33.200]  strangled and we're being killed and these people are just getting away with stuff never before seen
[57:33.200 --> 57:39.120]  it's their wish list it's a giant bioethics test to see what they can get hospital workers and the
[57:39.120 --> 57:43.760]  public to go along with it's the hospital workers that are the most awake group out there i've seen
[57:43.760 --> 57:47.680]  they're like we're empty we're told to put people that didn't die cobit on the cobit list we get a
[57:47.680 --> 57:51.920]  bunch of money we're all getting bonuses but we're told to shut our mouths i could open the
[57:51.920 --> 57:57.360]  phones up right now and take medical worker after medical worker after medical worker but see the
[57:57.360 --> 58:03.280]  globalists are smart they go oh you don't like the medical workers they're heroes well on an average
[58:03.280 --> 58:10.880]  day emt's uh trauma nurses you name it it's a tough job and they are hardworking folks
[58:11.760 --> 58:16.560]  make no damn mistake i watch my dad just do an oral surgery and dentistry half kill himself
[58:16.560 --> 58:22.400]  with all those patients how stressful that work was that's nothing compared to emt's and people and
[58:22.400 --> 58:26.880]  police that see uh you know kids dead and car wrecks and stuff that'll that'll change you forever
[58:26.880 --> 58:33.440]  nobody said there weren't heroes in the medical system but there's an evil system taking it over and
[58:33.440 --> 58:38.720]  there's this decision that old people don't don't have values so let's just kill them snake a tube
[58:38.720 --> 58:43.040]  down their throat no one is going to kill them because you're being paid to slowly murder them
[58:45.120 --> 58:51.520]  but so they test positive for cobit 19 let's play this video they put individuals in there
[58:51.520 --> 59:00.880]  who was a patient put there by the governor of michigan because that's what you're supposed
[59:00.880 --> 59:06.720]  to do with a 20 year old individual who's not even sick is sticking in with the old people
[59:08.800 --> 59:12.080]  so that jaden hayden
[59:12.080 --> 59:23.920]  can be another patient they make money off of here it is
[59:23.920 --> 59:35.760]  so
[59:39.520 --> 59:45.280]  so that is not a nurse that is a patient put in there by the governor and by the way it's
[59:45.280 --> 59:51.520]  on record the governor ordered this mentally ill people my guys obviously completely mentally ill
[59:51.520 --> 59:57.840]  beating the living snot out of old people choking old women punching old women in the
[59:57.840 --> 1:00:03.360]  throat this is an old man and then he posts this is his black supremacy
[1:00:06.960 --> 1:00:13.520]  i mean this is absolute mental illness but you know that have been a white person doing that
[1:00:13.520 --> 1:00:18.960]  they just said oh this is this is what white people do but when this guy does it we go oh
[1:00:18.960 --> 1:00:22.800]  he's mentally ill because the guys come i wouldn't watch the youtube channel completely start raving
[1:00:22.800 --> 1:00:29.120]  lunatic probably has about an ad iq probably become vaccines but that part doesn't matter
[1:00:29.120 --> 1:00:34.800]  the point is is that they're put a homicidal crazy person in a nursing home where he ran around for
[1:00:34.800 --> 1:00:41.280]  weeks posting videos of him drugging people beating people punching old women in the throat
[1:00:41.280 --> 1:00:50.880]  this guy's not going to do too well in prison and you know i don't take any pleasure in that either
[1:00:50.880 --> 1:00:55.840]  there's so many mentally ill sick people out there but let me tell you who's guilty all of us
[1:00:56.720 --> 1:01:01.120]  for allowing this type of crap to go on that came out like a week ago and no one was even
[1:01:01.120 --> 1:01:04.880]  going to find out who it was so judicial watch went and filed to be able to find out because no
[1:01:04.880 --> 1:01:09.200]  one even cares i mean hell i guess i didn't care i mean i thought somebody else would do it right
[1:01:09.200 --> 1:01:17.120]  everybody's like oh somebody else yeah Detroit lawmaker critical of governor Whitmer's nursing
[1:01:17.120 --> 1:01:30.480]  home executive order to put sick people as COVID-19 response hubs main treatment centers for people
[1:01:30.480 --> 1:01:39.760]  that aren't even from the nursing home that's why i went crazy i mean because because i already
[1:01:39.760 --> 1:01:43.200]  know all this you already know this but when it hits you that print me that article please
[1:01:43.200 --> 1:01:47.200]  when it hits you that they did all this premeditatedly oh well this is just ammonia
[1:01:47.200 --> 1:01:52.320]  well let's kill off a bunch these old people and get rich i'm a woman though it's okay i'm a woman
[1:01:52.320 --> 1:01:59.920]  governor info wars has become a symbol an emblem of not just american freedom but worldwide
[1:01:59.920 --> 1:02:05.520]  maverick spirit it's not just myself for the host at info wars for the researchers or the
[1:02:05.520 --> 1:02:11.280]  journalist it's you the listeners the activists the people on the front lines in the arena and it's
[1:02:11.280 --> 1:02:16.960]  the amazing guests and individuals that we interview that make info wars so special because
[1:02:16.960 --> 1:02:22.400]  we're not putting a filter in front of free minds we're having an open discussion about the real
[1:02:22.400 --> 1:02:26.800]  state of the world not the establishment and talking points that are put out by the council
[1:02:26.800 --> 1:02:32.000]  on fine relations the boulderburton group the debuts group and other globalists we're pushing
[1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:39.280]  for a pro human future where we build a planet and beyond based on humans for humans by humans
[1:02:39.280 --> 1:02:44.480]  not a world where the establishment hate themselves project their hate onto us and decide
[1:02:44.480 --> 1:02:49.600]  we're gonna have a post human world i'm really excited to know that info wars has your support
[1:02:49.600 --> 1:03:00.560]  i want to thank you all for being pro human and pro god
[1:03:00.560 --> 1:03:19.520]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance you're listening to alex jones
[1:03:21.920 --> 1:03:28.880]  okay uh you turn on any national news story and you'll see articles going it's insane
[1:03:28.880 --> 1:03:34.000]  i mean bill gates is a perfect little angel keg he never wanted to get rid of old people he never
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:38.960]  wanted to euthanize anybody he never wanted to depopulate africa he never wanted to do anything
[1:03:38.960 --> 1:03:42.960]  he never had vaccine problems uh with people getting killed from his vaccines even though
[1:03:42.960 --> 1:03:47.120]  you can find all the mainstream articles and all the reports and all the admissions going back
[1:03:47.120 --> 1:03:52.400]  for over 20 years and bill gates his dad running plant parenthood and bill gates singers too many
[1:03:52.400 --> 1:03:56.400]  people we need to depopulate the planet his main focus being africa that's london guardian
[1:03:56.400 --> 1:04:00.560]  headline bill gates is really worried about africa's overpopulation
[1:04:04.080 --> 1:04:07.200]  and then it's like oh well we just you know get rid of people that's what we do
[1:04:08.160 --> 1:04:14.080]  but then oh but if a white person shoots a black person questionably sure we should cover it
[1:04:14.080 --> 1:04:18.560]  but it's like the end of the world tonight the evil whites are trying to kill the black people
[1:04:18.560 --> 1:04:25.840]  and and who are the evil whites they're those gun owners yeah we need to take the guns
[1:04:25.840 --> 1:04:31.840]  from the white supremacist meanwhile the real gun is an attaining anoculation the real gun
[1:04:31.840 --> 1:04:36.480]  is a global depression the real gun is not developing the third world and educating people
[1:04:37.520 --> 1:04:41.840]  that's the gun pointed at them and then the globalists are totally malthusian they use the gun
[1:04:41.840 --> 1:04:46.880]  against us they collapse the third world and use it against us and they admit that's their plan so
[1:04:47.760 --> 1:04:52.960]  there are all these articles out there about oh bill gates doesn't want to do anything why
[1:04:52.960 --> 1:04:59.600]  yes he's got a patent 2020 0 6 0 6 0 6 that's a global cryptocurrency for you to buy and sell
[1:05:01.040 --> 1:05:07.360]  and it's a wristwatch or a phone or an app or a tattoo or a chip oh but jones says it's a chip
[1:05:07.360 --> 1:05:13.200]  no then he has another group he funded out of mit that also has a digital tattoo but it's a bunch
[1:05:13.200 --> 1:05:18.240]  of little little little spikes little micro needles that then put it into your skin and break off in
[1:05:18.240 --> 1:05:23.360]  your skin and then and then you can't dig the chip out because it's a hundred little chips literally
[1:05:23.360 --> 1:05:29.760]  you know look at the patent so so this is this is what they're funding this is what they're doing
[1:05:33.440 --> 1:05:38.080]  by the way folks they always say i'm sweating on there the rest of the rest of this office is
[1:05:38.080 --> 1:05:43.120]  like an icebox the only room no matter they can't ever cool is the one i'm in which is fine with me
[1:05:43.760 --> 1:05:47.600]  but but with these big tv's behind me and these lights it's about you know 85 degrees in here
[1:05:47.600 --> 1:05:51.760]  i'm a big guy and i start sweating which is fine because i'm real i don't worry makeup that's how
[1:05:51.760 --> 1:05:55.760]  it is but you know today the ac is not working properly such as the way that you have to have
[1:05:55.760 --> 1:06:04.640]  me up here i'm an old preacher getting all sweaty but we're sitting here looking at all this
[1:06:05.360 --> 1:06:08.480]  they always play this game like oh there's no global government well you just said you want a
[1:06:08.480 --> 1:06:11.680]  global government oh that's a different global government than the one you're talking about
[1:06:11.680 --> 1:06:19.760]  so an invisible quantum dot tattoo could be used to i d vaccinated kids and it turns out
[1:06:19.760 --> 1:06:25.200]  that's from science alert that's being funded by the bill in the gates foundation that's mainstream
[1:06:25.200 --> 1:06:31.040]  news bill gates am i to develop tattoo i d to check for vaccinations but they're saying
[1:06:31.680 --> 1:06:36.320]  doesn't exist so you don't mount a resistance to it and so at the time you're at the clinic or
[1:06:36.320 --> 1:06:40.640]  ever to get on the airplane or get a job they're like oh it's a new type of shot it's just a little
[1:06:40.640 --> 1:06:46.240]  sticker we just roll it across you you get a rash because they're little micro needles
[1:06:47.680 --> 1:06:52.640]  and so you put your arm in a machine it goes presses it down the sticker comes back up but
[1:06:52.640 --> 1:06:59.040]  now it's in your body did you hear what i just said little digital microchips 20 years ago they
[1:06:59.040 --> 1:07:05.280]  could put all the books in the world on the head of a pin now they can put everything they want in
[1:07:05.280 --> 1:07:11.920]  one of those heads of a pen and that's what this is folks into your body oh they won't abuse that at
[1:07:11.920 --> 1:07:17.360]  all it's all unfolding and they've got the job of telling you everything's okay so so here's a clip
[1:07:18.320 --> 1:07:23.760]  from one of the bill in the gates funded groups bragging about this digital tattoo here it is
[1:07:25.920 --> 1:07:32.640]  in 2014 it was announced that microchips biotech ink a company in lexington massachusetts had developed
[1:07:32.640 --> 1:07:38.640]  a new form of birth control a wireless implant that can be turned on and off with a remote control
[1:07:38.640 --> 1:07:45.040]  and that is designed to last up to 16 years according to mit technology review the idea
[1:07:45.040 --> 1:07:50.880]  originated when bill gates visited robert langer's mit lab in 2012 and asked him if it would be
[1:07:50.880 --> 1:07:55.520]  possible to create an implantable birth control device that could be turned on or off remotely
[1:07:56.560 --> 1:08:01.040]  langer referred gates to the controlled release microchip technology he had invented and licensed
[1:08:01.040 --> 1:08:06.480]  to microchips biotechnology and the gates foundation granted 20 million dollars to the firm to develop
[1:08:06.480 --> 1:08:13.120]  the implants reducing population growth has by gates his own admission been a core mission of
[1:08:13.120 --> 1:08:19.040]  the gates foundation since its inception but in order to really understand what gates means by
[1:08:19.040 --> 1:08:24.160]  population control we have to look beyond the concept of controlling population size
[1:08:24.160 --> 1:08:30.560]  at its most fundamental level the population control the gate speaks of is not birth control
[1:08:30.560 --> 1:08:37.760]  but control of the population itself the research including nor plant a contraceptive implanted
[1:08:37.760 --> 1:08:43.680]  under the skin of a woman's upper arm and effective for five years in its 1988 report the
[1:08:43.680 --> 1:08:48.240]  Rockefeller foundation was pleased to announce that nor plant which was developed by the Rockefeller
[1:08:48.240 --> 1:08:55.440]  founded population council was now approved for marketing in 12 countries the Rockefellers
[1:08:55.440 --> 1:09:01.440]  population council and other research organizations joined with the world health organization in 1972
[1:09:01.440 --> 1:09:07.920]  to create a task force on vaccines for fertility regulation by 1995 they were able to report
[1:09:07.920 --> 1:09:16.160]  progress in developing a now we come back from the same piece that corbett put out title bill
[1:09:16.160 --> 1:09:22.240]  gates is human control grid it actually shows MIT talking about how and now we've got this digital
[1:09:22.240 --> 1:09:26.960]  tattoo that just goes in we did it for the bill in the gates foundation but that was a good primer
[1:09:26.960 --> 1:09:33.120]  for you so that you could see how they're funding the implantable microchip movement directly
[1:09:33.120 --> 1:09:37.040]  below Monday gates with the documents with the Rockefeller foundation which again just handed
[1:09:37.040 --> 1:09:41.920]  its baton to bill in the gates because the Rockefellers didn't find somebody as hard working as bill
[1:09:41.920 --> 1:09:47.120]  gates to carry on David Rockefeller handed the baton to him about 15 years ago as best we can
[1:09:47.120 --> 1:09:52.080]  tell and so he runs the whole enchilada he runs the whole show so we have that and then the reason
[1:09:52.080 --> 1:09:58.000]  I was prefacing all of this a new article by jaymie white just went up on info wars.com we have a
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:05.440]  five minute video that deals with this kovie pass has come out you care this is digital health passport
[1:10:05.440 --> 1:10:09.360]  to monitor travel health and population so china developed it with the globalist they already had
[1:10:09.360 --> 1:10:14.480]  it ready on the shelf and they talked about it in event 201 last october bill in the gates did
[1:10:14.480 --> 1:10:19.200]  and so now it's all being rolled out how wonderful it is how good it is and how much you're going
[1:10:19.200 --> 1:10:25.680]  to enjoy all that so we have that clip for you in the key clip that is the video representation

[1:15:12.640 --> 1:15:19.520]  survival of the fittest the theory of species charles darwin wasn't 50 years later
[1:15:19.520 --> 1:15:26.400]  ever he developed that in the 1850s a digital frontier that they rolled out the theory of
[1:15:26.400 --> 1:15:34.240]  social darwinism which is an excuse to do whatever you want to anybody as long as you
[1:15:34.240 --> 1:15:40.320]  can get away with it you're gonna steal big sons deal super big if you steal small
[1:15:42.560 --> 1:15:48.560]  you don't get the respect of the controllers that's their worldview and they think everybody else
[1:15:48.560 --> 1:15:53.200]  is like them they think people with morals and people that have courage people that stand for
[1:15:53.200 --> 1:15:59.680]  something and build things are weak but they're the parasites that have invaded and taken over
[1:15:59.680 --> 1:16:06.320]  the system that prohumans of the human race of red blood built here on this planet
[1:16:07.360 --> 1:16:14.720]  fords from the iron of the earth gastron for the stars the great test is here and is upon us now
[1:16:14.720 --> 1:16:19.600]  so here's a clip from corvettes a great little documentary part three series bill gates
[1:16:20.400 --> 1:16:26.720]  population control grid and he plays a clip from mit and the companies are working with
[1:16:26.720 --> 1:16:30.880]  with these new chips that are getting like little pieces of glass you were busted a coke bottle in
[1:16:30.880 --> 1:16:35.440]  your house or a beer bottle and it's little tiny shards you can't see them you step on them and
[1:16:35.440 --> 1:16:40.880]  it's in your bottom of your foot that's what these little silicate and and carbon are but they've
[1:16:40.880 --> 1:16:46.480]  got chips etched into them here it is to investigate new ways to permanently store and record the
[1:16:46.480 --> 1:16:52.480]  vaccination information of each individual the result of their research was a new vaccine delivery
[1:16:52.480 --> 1:16:58.000]  method they found that by using dissolvable microneedles that deliver patterns of near
[1:16:58.000 --> 1:17:03.040]  infrared light emitting micro particles to the skin they could create particle patterns in the
[1:17:03.040 --> 1:17:08.800]  skin of vaccine recipients which are invisible to the eye but can be imaged using modified smartphones
[1:17:08.800 --> 1:17:15.200]  rice university describes the quantum dot tags left behind by the microneedles as something
[1:17:15.200 --> 1:17:22.480]  like a barcode tattoo so who was behind this development as lead researcher kevin mckew
[1:17:22.480 --> 1:17:28.880]  explains the bill and melinda gates foundation came to us and said hey we have a real problem
[1:17:29.600 --> 1:17:36.720]  knowing who's vaccinated so our idea was to put the record on the person this way later on
[1:17:36.720 --> 1:17:41.520]  people can scan over the area to see what vaccines have been administered and give only the one still
[1:17:41.520 --> 1:17:47.360]  needed oh it's your idea to get something inside somebody's but there's mit news but i have a
[1:17:47.360 --> 1:17:52.160]  stack of news here i'll show you after this report we're about to play where they say it doesn't
[1:17:52.160 --> 1:18:00.160]  exist it's a conspiracy theory and now all over twitter especially the facebook and google platforms
[1:18:00.160 --> 1:18:06.560]  youtube you name it if you're not an approved source mainline liberal mainline conservative
[1:18:06.560 --> 1:18:13.920]  it doesn't matter if you're not in a credited source you can't type in covid 19 or pandemic
[1:18:15.760 --> 1:18:18.880]  that's how they control now people questioning the whole hoax is
[1:18:20.160 --> 1:18:24.800]  katelyn benesu in a video on it she can't even upload stuff to a bunch of platforms that says
[1:18:24.800 --> 1:18:29.840]  pandemic they're not even checking what she says to agree with it not just banning doctors that was
[1:18:29.840 --> 1:18:35.920]  so last month not just banning cedar sinai that was so last month no now it's that you can't say
[1:18:35.920 --> 1:18:44.800]  pandemic just like that see oh but trump's gonna form a blue ribbon commission to see if hitler
[1:18:44.800 --> 1:18:49.680]  was a nazi trumps are forming a blue ribbon commission when your house is on fire uh you
[1:18:49.680 --> 1:18:54.400]  know to see if uh we should send the fire department i mean this is too little too late it's a great
[1:18:54.400 --> 1:19:00.240]  failure and trump may be very surprised in 160 days uh but here is covee pass uk introduces
[1:19:00.240 --> 1:19:05.280]  digital health passport to monitor travel health and population it's all just magically already
[1:19:05.280 --> 1:19:11.200]  built and ready like we told you months ago now rolling out here it is covee pass is the new digital
[1:19:11.200 --> 1:19:19.680]  health passport developed by the british cyber security firm oh thank god enterprises covee pass
[1:19:19.680 --> 1:19:26.960]  is powered by the revolutionary and painstead v code and the technology here's how it works a
[1:19:26.960 --> 1:19:32.720]  social credit score using the secure covee pass platform an authorized health care professional
[1:19:32.720 --> 1:19:40.400]  nurse or doctor can apply for an administration account sjw by a verified individual only an
[1:19:40.400 --> 1:19:47.280]  authorized user can create a digital pass health care passport on the platform the steps are as
[1:19:47.280 --> 1:19:53.280]  follows the authorized health care professional creates a new passport account by filling out the
[1:19:53.280 --> 1:20:00.000]  individual's unique data fields if the user has pre-registered at home the health care professional
[1:20:00.000 --> 1:20:05.600]  can simply scan the individual's predefined v code that will automatically onboard the user
[1:20:05.600 --> 1:20:10.720]  to oh now all my health that i've given it over to big tech to share oh thank you the traffic
[1:20:10.720 --> 1:20:18.000]  designated covid-19 test kit by scanning the v code attached oh another set kit to boost the numbers
[1:20:18.000 --> 1:20:24.480]  if a v code is not present and then if we kill you later we get more money mark yourself for
[1:20:24.480 --> 1:20:30.800]  death please upload the results the health care professional will then set the trigger date for
[1:20:30.800 --> 1:20:36.240]  the individual being tested to come back for a follow-up test while the special measures are in
[1:20:36.240 --> 1:20:42.000]  place when bush used to talk about pit torturers you go with these professionals they're very professional
[1:20:43.440 --> 1:20:50.320]  the covee pass digital passport is then assigned to the user's covee pass an individual can use a
[1:20:50.320 --> 1:20:56.000]  covee pass digital passport by presenting their v code either on their mobile and you get special
[1:20:56.000 --> 1:21:03.040]  deals once scanned the covee pass you're on the digital government control grid securely using
[1:21:03.040 --> 1:21:09.120]  permission based access oh this means different information is delivered to the scanning handset
[1:21:09.120 --> 1:21:15.920]  based on their user id geolocation simon awesome geolocation and amounts of times they have been
[1:21:15.920 --> 1:21:22.720]  scanned oh tracking you come not use gluten and does not track the movements of the individual
[1:21:22.720 --> 1:21:29.120]  this one you're carrying around all your personal data and settings it only scans information relevant
[1:21:29.120 --> 1:21:34.000]  at the time we do not eat cows we butcher only smaller pieces we butcher information delivered
[1:21:34.000 --> 1:21:40.640]  to the public is minimal and consists of name photo and their health traffic light system that flows
[1:21:40.640 --> 1:21:46.240]  from green immediately after this so before they were worried about even metadata now it's like it's
[1:21:46.240 --> 1:21:52.560]  only your name health history and how small your penis is the department guidelines the v code itself
[1:21:52.560 --> 1:21:58.720]  plays an amazing part when it comes to crowd management and leaves behind all oh crowd management
[1:21:58.720 --> 1:22:04.800]  oh v code can be scanned outside of the safe distancing zone of two oh as advised by the
[1:22:04.800 --> 1:22:09.680]  government this oh it's advised by the gun it tells if you're too close to somebody oh

[1:23:56.160 --> 1:23:59.840]  going back three months ago i'm not buying storeable food because i'm worried about the
[1:23:59.840 --> 1:24:04.080]  covid-19 virus i'm worried about the food shortages and the economic collapse and now
[1:24:04.080 --> 1:24:08.320]  it's admitted that a chain reaction has begun that's already caused food shortages and the
[1:24:08.320 --> 1:24:12.480]  collapse of farms and ranches across the united states and that's even worse in the third world
[1:24:12.480 --> 1:24:17.120]  so i hope trump with his initiatives can clean this up and fix it but with the election fraud
[1:24:17.120 --> 1:24:22.000]  and the covid-19 all the wars and the third world collapsing and everything else is going on

[1:25:25.440 --> 1:25:29.920]  from the beginning of my research it was clear the globalists are an authoritarian anti-human
[1:25:29.920 --> 1:25:35.840]  group they have to put this electronic straightjacket on us before they carry out their end game
[1:25:35.840 --> 1:25:43.680]  which is global depopulation so you see submitting to them is death the only way to stop them is to
[1:25:43.680 --> 1:25:49.920]  expose them to hate their guts and realize they are humanity's mortal enemy wake up or die

[1:27:32.320 --> 1:27:38.960]  of coronavirus victims 27 year old man who was murdered they don't care it's all part of engaging
[1:27:38.960 --> 1:27:45.120]  in fraud it's all part of saying two million would die and it's 100 000 almost all of them died of
[1:27:45.120 --> 1:27:51.920]  something else 500 000 died in the uk not even 10 of that so i'm gonna open the phones up here for
[1:27:51.920 --> 1:27:58.000]  medical workers doctors nurses health care providers we'll go write your calls give each person about

[1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:11.520]  number to join us is eight seven seven seven eight nine alex eight seven seven seven seven eight
[1:28:11.520 --> 1:28:17.680]  nine two five three nine eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine medical workers
[1:28:17.680 --> 1:28:24.480]  doctors nurses virologist we've done this probably 15 times or so the last few months every caller
[1:28:24.480 --> 1:28:31.200]  calls in and says it's a giant hoax a giant fraud cops call in whose wives are nurses that you know
[1:28:31.200 --> 1:28:36.000]  that they say the same thing empty hospitals people watch it netflix all day and that's on the good
[1:28:36.000 --> 1:28:41.440]  side some some hospitals are like orgies that's just the way it is folks doctors and nurses are
[1:28:41.440 --> 1:28:45.120]  very comfortable with their bodies they're very promiscuous it's well known you don't know about
[1:28:45.120 --> 1:28:49.520]  the medical field you get been involved in it but that's what's going on not attacking these people
[1:28:50.080 --> 1:28:57.920]  the point is is that suicides are at record levels they're reporting 80 plus percent increase
[1:28:58.560 --> 1:29:05.200]  in psychotropic drug prescriptions from psychiatrists of new customers since they started
[1:29:05.200 --> 1:29:10.880]  suicides up five fold across the country this is real folks people not being treated for
[1:29:10.880 --> 1:29:17.600]  pre-existing conditions is is is outpacing even the fake death numbers from covid but Stalin said
[1:29:17.600 --> 1:29:24.000]  one man dies it's a tragedy 10 000 dies is statistic they know how to focus in on each person and
[1:29:24.000 --> 1:29:30.320]  make it a huge deal and build it up like you're next to bring in that level of control eight seven
[1:29:30.320 --> 1:29:35.840]  seven seven eight nine alex will put the call system up on screen there and i will go to calls
[1:29:36.480 --> 1:29:43.280]  as soon as we're able to get them up and on the board here today but here's a couple of important
[1:29:43.280 --> 1:29:50.240]  clips i want to get to i'm not against the average muslim they're a human being with a soul and a
[1:29:50.240 --> 1:29:55.920]  lot of them are great people but the political systems of islam are authoritarian and oppressive
[1:29:55.920 --> 1:30:04.160]  of an anti-western anti christ and you have the house of islam wherever islam's in control
[1:30:04.160 --> 1:30:08.880]  and outside of that is the house of war and so it's not compatible but in europe and in
[1:30:10.080 --> 1:30:14.960]  now united states to great extent except for trump and especially in the uk they're accepting the
[1:30:14.960 --> 1:30:24.000]  most cancerous forms of islam and so here's an islamic call to prayer broadcast on loudspeakers
[1:30:24.000 --> 1:30:30.240]  in great britain that's been celebrated as political and spiritual diversity imagine if
[1:30:30.880 --> 1:30:38.240]  i bought a building in the middle of london and put a 500 watt speaker on there and started
[1:30:38.240 --> 1:30:42.400]  talking about the new world order or about jesus christ they come shut me down saying hey you don't
[1:30:42.400 --> 1:30:48.640]  have a right to do that public area but from michigan to texas from london to los angeles
[1:30:48.640 --> 1:30:55.840]  from rio de genero to berlin there are called the prayers i don't like to come to chinese but
[1:30:55.840 --> 1:31:00.720]  they don't put up with that because they know it's a group trying to take them over hey chai
[1:31:00.720 --> 1:31:08.400]  coms do your thing don't try to take me over so here's islamic call to prayer broadcast in
[1:31:08.400 --> 1:31:30.000]  london from a major building here is this is planting the flag this is pissing on our grave
[1:31:32.640 --> 1:31:35.920]  and they bragged on the websites like oh we've we've conquered them they're so weak
[1:31:35.920 --> 1:31:40.160]  your women are ours and that's a big part of the sex slavery because if you are not islamic
[1:31:40.160 --> 1:31:46.320]  you're a sex life i mean let me tell you the muslims invented pimping it's like it's so cool
[1:31:46.320 --> 1:32:05.440]  they pimp slap our women whether they be black or white notice he doesn't adopt your dress he
[1:32:05.440 --> 1:32:10.720]  didn't he didn't want to know you're gonna adopt what he's saying oh by the way unless you're from
[1:32:10.720 --> 1:32:17.200]  the right family you know under under islam they say black people aren't humans and are quote
[1:32:17.200 --> 1:32:23.120]  raisin heads and that they deserve to be slaves that that's where the transatlantic slave trade
[1:32:23.120 --> 1:32:30.080]  christians had never interpreted the bible that uh ham and cane enable that blacks were like a bat
[1:32:30.080 --> 1:32:35.760]  the mark of cane was black christians never taught that till the muslims taught us and then we went oh
[1:32:35.760 --> 1:32:42.000]  really we can enslave black people because they're of ham and they're of cane that's in the history
[1:32:42.000 --> 1:32:48.720]  books the muslims literally taught europeans about slavery and look i'm not defending any anybody
[1:32:48.720 --> 1:32:56.720]  doing it it's bad but i like to know where stuff came from i mean while europe was abolishing slavery
[1:32:56.720 --> 1:33:01.600]  because people were slaves in germany and france and in what's england or scotland today i mean
[1:33:01.600 --> 1:33:05.600]  you have the elites the people everybody else was slaves i mean you didn't do what you were told you
[1:33:05.600 --> 1:33:11.440]  got killed it's called feudalism so europe was about getting rid of slavery but boy did we take
[1:33:11.440 --> 1:33:17.920]  debate about 1500 portugal in spain which had just kicked the muslims out so kind of spain and
[1:33:17.920 --> 1:33:25.040]  portugal kind of picked up on them and went well blacks you know are cursed of god and so we can
[1:33:25.040 --> 1:33:32.160]  do this to them i mean you know that's where that started right and and it's in the quran
[1:33:33.360 --> 1:33:39.520]  that black people aren't humans and that's why or they deserve what's happening to them
[1:33:40.160 --> 1:33:46.080]  it's kind of that two fifth the deal two thirds human all that stuff you've heard before that all
[1:33:46.080 --> 1:33:50.320]  came out of this and i'm not even attacking islam i'm just not going to sit here and play games with
[1:33:50.320 --> 1:33:57.840]  this i want the christianity of jesus christ and what martin Luther king said we judge people off
[1:33:57.840 --> 1:34:03.600]  what they do and how they produce and what they stand for not off what color they are that's what
[1:34:03.600 --> 1:34:09.600]  we believe in well according to the shiites you're not even have a seat at the table unless you're
[1:34:09.600 --> 1:34:19.840]  related to muhammad okay i mean give me a break man look at north korea with a hereditary dictatorship

[1:36:19.120 --> 1:36:25.120]  which is great i like max but if it's just it's a serious show on rt if he does that show we're
[1:36:25.120 --> 1:36:31.840]  gonna have a nice discussion if it just turns into a like a threat syndrome of a bitcoin

[1:36:42.160 --> 1:36:54.320]  away so we'll see what happens the united states is not communist china we don't have three million
[1:36:54.320 --> 1:37:00.080]  people in concentration camps we don't blow up churches we don't kill political dissidents and
[1:37:00.080 --> 1:37:06.880]  sell their organs but all over the news we see the un billable indicates who mainstream corporate
[1:37:06.880 --> 1:37:13.040]  media praising communist china for their response and if communist china shoots women at checkpoints
[1:37:13.040 --> 1:37:17.840]  and welds people into their houses and has robots controlling people well then gee we've got to do
[1:37:17.840 --> 1:37:22.960]  that and on top of it cities like san Antonio pass laws saying will arrest you if you say chinese
[1:37:22.960 --> 1:37:28.960]  virus well now qualmo in new york's calling it the european virus these people are out of control
[1:37:28.960 --> 1:37:33.920]  control freaks and they are going to lose big time because we the people are aware of their
[1:37:33.920 --> 1:37:39.840]  criminal activities and are exposing them in their power grab the resistance lives at bandot video
[1:37:39.840 --> 1:37:45.440]  and info wars dot com spread those links and jam it down the censors throats and then we'll be able
[1:37:45.440 --> 1:37:51.760]  to defeat their operation that much quicker memorial day is here it's one of the biggest
[1:37:51.760 --> 1:37:56.000]  sales of the year and we were already running a huge sale but we're having to end that one
[1:37:56.000 --> 1:38:00.000]  because a bunch of items are selling out but all the items we have left in stock are still
[1:38:00.000 --> 1:38:05.440]  on record sale and then five items that weren't on sale we got back in stock they're also massively
[1:38:05.440 --> 1:38:12.240]  discounted as well for the memorial day special so here it is super male vitality 40 off knockout
[1:38:12.240 --> 1:38:17.440]  the great sleeping 50 off brain force plus hadn't been on sale for almost six months it is 50
[1:38:17.440 --> 1:38:24.320]  percent off biotry selenium 60 percent off shale force it's incredible 60 percent off and you've
[1:38:24.320 --> 1:38:29.840]  got all these other items on sale as well until they sell out so info wars store dot com or triple
[1:38:29.840 --> 1:38:35.440]  eight two five three three one three nine to get these items to take advantage of this mega sale
[1:38:35.440 --> 1:38:40.720]  memorial day again thank you all for watching we appreciate your support your financial support

[1:38:50.240 --> 1:38:55.440]  i was talking to my wife tonight and i was saying our economy slowing down and shutting down is
[1:38:55.440 --> 1:39:00.400]  like shooting a deer and it runs a hundred yards before it knows it's been shot and then it finally
[1:39:00.400 --> 1:39:05.680]  dies she said well yeah when i grew up in Omaha Nebraska one time there was an argument in the
[1:39:05.680 --> 1:39:11.120]  street and another man shot another man in the head and the man that got shot in the head had blood
[1:39:11.120 --> 1:39:17.040]  pouring out a huge hole he was holding it he walked around gibbering talking nonsense for about 60
[1:39:17.040 --> 1:39:22.720]  seconds and then just fell over dead well that's what's going to happen with our economy it is in
[1:39:22.720 --> 1:39:29.440]  cardiac arrest this has been done by design and the un the chai comms the mainstream media orchestrated
[1:39:29.440 --> 1:39:34.960]  it hyped it and tried to keep the economy closed so remember the depression that's coming and the
[1:39:34.960 --> 1:39:42.080]  third world collapse is all on the un on billa melinda gates on obama on hillary on biden on
[1:39:42.080 --> 1:39:46.960]  the democrats we tried to stop it we tried to fight it but you guys said you wanted to wreck
[1:39:46.960 --> 1:39:52.320]  america and the world and now you've done it congratulations i'm always excited about info wars
[1:39:52.320 --> 1:39:56.160]  life products they're amazing they're cutting edge you love them i love them and they find the info
[1:39:56.160 --> 1:40:02.240]  war in the face of the globalist onslaught but we have come up with a new product over a year in
[1:40:02.240 --> 1:40:10.880]  development that is amazing the only organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic
[1:40:10.880 --> 1:40:18.320]  essential oils on top of it and there's another innovation it's the spray cap it doesn't just
[1:40:18.320 --> 1:40:25.040]  pour out a bunch of thick gross you gooo but it's high quality it aerosolizes it in a really great
[1:40:25.040 --> 1:40:30.320]  way i like to put on my hands rub a little bit on my face it's got organic alcohol in it so spray
[1:40:30.320 --> 1:40:36.400]  it around your eyes but i just love it personally has something that's a moisturizer as well so
[1:40:36.400 --> 1:40:39.600]  this is the real innovation i don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand
[1:40:39.600 --> 1:40:45.680]  sanitizer that actually has essential oil in it so it doesn't dry you out smells great it's so
[1:40:45.680 --> 1:41:01.600]  refreshing this is a big winner you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:41:01.600 --> 1:41:17.360]  welcome back i'm your host alex jones max kaiser is coming up and taking your calls right now
[1:41:18.080 --> 1:41:24.240]  john is in tennessee he's a hca manager healthcare records for hospitals i was just
[1:41:24.240 --> 1:41:29.840]  covering how the new york times just putting out lists of people shot by guns you know killed by cars
[1:41:29.840 --> 1:41:34.720]  died of cancer they're saying covid-19 washington state's been caught it's all mounting
[1:41:35.280 --> 1:41:41.200]  why did major governors like michigan and others under un directives say nursing homes or
[1:41:41.200 --> 1:41:45.760]  covid emergency centers that's the last thing you do as somebody that works in the healthcare
[1:41:45.760 --> 1:41:52.800]  field what do you really think is going on john thanks for calling hey i've noticed that there's
[1:41:52.800 --> 1:41:58.960]  a lot of information being shared that really scratches the surface of of hippo violation in
[1:41:58.960 --> 1:42:04.800]  my opinion like i shouldn't be able to point at my neighbor and say i think he's got anything
[1:42:06.080 --> 1:42:10.640]  yeah we've got laws protecting our medical records now we're just told oh big tech's tracking you
[1:42:10.640 --> 1:42:16.880]  oh all your medical records are public now yeah it's sick so that's changed somehow because that's
[1:42:16.880 --> 1:42:22.160]  not an issue at all well exactly if you release something about who's in the hospital you go to
[1:42:22.160 --> 1:42:28.960]  jail for 10 years but now suddenly it's just a bum rush on our final rights i mean that's all it is
[1:42:28.960 --> 1:42:34.800]  well yeah i also want to mention um so specifically what i do is try to help the
[1:42:34.800 --> 1:42:47.200]  physicians get paid um about 180 hospitals or so um this uh this cryptocurrency is pretty much
[1:42:47.200 --> 1:42:53.360]  what i do now only it's not crypt it's not it's not going to it's the reverse we wait for people
[1:42:53.360 --> 1:42:58.880]  to tell us what they did and then we approve that work they're going to reverse that in the cryptocurrency
[1:42:58.880 --> 1:43:05.200]  system and they're going to hand out your task like a communist you know dictatorship where
[1:43:05.200 --> 1:43:08.480]  you're told what you're going to do today no matter what it is you have to go kill somebody
[1:43:08.480 --> 1:43:13.280]  that's what you got to do if you want to get paid you know that's not the way it's supposed to work
[1:43:13.280 --> 1:43:16.640]  you're supposed to tell us what you did today and we're going to approve that work and then you
[1:43:16.640 --> 1:43:21.920]  might get payment it shouldn't be the other way around they're prepaying everybody it's
[1:43:21.920 --> 1:43:26.800]  going to reverse everything i think it's a horrible idea i don't know how we can avoid it and again
[1:43:26.800 --> 1:43:31.280]  that's in the patents that's what's being pushed promoted then they counter and go oh that's a
[1:43:31.280 --> 1:43:36.480]  conspiracy theory what do you make of that where they roll it out publicly then they say it's a
[1:43:36.480 --> 1:43:44.640]  conspiracy theory it's just a way to misdirect to try to point they're going to try to point the
[1:43:44.640 --> 1:43:50.160]  finger i think you brought this up where they are the heroes and they come out smelling like roses
[1:43:50.800 --> 1:43:55.520]  that everybody wants to buy you know everybody has to have whatever they're selling which is i
[1:43:55.520 --> 1:44:01.200]  think that's bill gates work that we have to create the the requirement for our existence
[1:44:01.200 --> 1:44:04.560]  he said something like that and so that's what they're doing they're pointing the finger at
[1:44:04.560 --> 1:44:08.160]  everybody else saying look at you look what you're doing when that's what they're doing
[1:44:10.560 --> 1:44:14.400]  that's my i don't see how bill gates gets away with it but he's gotten away with so much
[1:44:14.400 --> 1:44:18.960]  that's why he just keeps doubling down like a psychotic criminal it's interesting how he was
[1:44:18.960 --> 1:44:25.120]  quiet for so long isn't he dropped out of he dropped off the software game and just went
[1:44:25.120 --> 1:44:30.800]  totally silent you know give him vaccines everywhere and now now he comes back into
[1:44:30.800 --> 1:44:35.440]  popularity somehow like now he's on every show tell us exactly what we're gonna do
[1:44:36.160 --> 1:44:41.600]  he suddenly our doctor our father our god our king our master our lord not mine but he wants to
[1:44:41.600 --> 1:44:48.880]  put things in our body he really cares about us no yeah i i will not be home that's the only thing i
[1:44:48.880 --> 1:44:55.360]  can say uh i don't know how we're supposed to avoid what's being brought down on it well they're
[1:44:55.360 --> 1:45:00.160]  spoiling for a fight but you know gates thought we would all just accept this this is not his name
[1:45:00.160 --> 1:45:05.120]  he's the most hated person in the world now but he we don't even see him we're not going to see
[1:45:05.120 --> 1:45:09.760]  what he's doing the marines are going to be delivering whatever it is itself we didn't even buy
[1:45:09.760 --> 1:45:16.160]  it you know no it doesn't sound like a very healthy thing he's doing great point sir god bless you

[1:49:05.360 --> 1:49:15.040]  fouchy and gates and all these people derrick in california biomedical worker at hospital on
[1:49:15.040 --> 1:49:21.040]  covet 19 what's your view on the situation thanks for calling it's a complete fraud this hospital
[1:49:21.040 --> 1:49:28.240]  has been empty the workers have been pulled off the work all of our hours reduced this is a complete
[1:49:28.240 --> 1:49:36.800]  and utter hoax of people who say they've had the covet 19 and have been around everybody
[1:49:36.800 --> 1:49:41.360]  and this contact tracing thing which is getting over which is getting a little bit out of hand here
[1:49:42.160 --> 1:49:49.200]  is it it's a fraud healthy people can't get it and if you have enough vitamin d if you're out in
[1:49:49.200 --> 1:49:53.920]  the sun like a good strong healthy person a smart person you're not going to get this you're not
[1:49:53.920 --> 1:50:01.760]  going to get sick there is no pandemic there has been zero demonstrated scientific contagion around
[1:50:01.760 --> 1:50:07.680]  this nobody is following scientific protocols when it comes to contagion when it comes to a virus
[1:50:08.320 --> 1:50:15.520]  they're they're working at this institution here in california on that rna vaccine they are receiving
[1:50:15.520 --> 1:50:19.680]  the funds from the bill and the linda gates foundation we get weekly updates on this and
[1:50:19.680 --> 1:50:24.240]  it's available to the public if you guys are interested in what they're doing here and there's
[1:50:26.800 --> 1:50:36.640]  bsl3 going on and all i want to say is people deserve to one get educated that there are
[1:50:36.640 --> 1:50:42.480]  cures for this natural cures one ozone therapy ozone therapy isn't even brought up if we look
[1:50:42.480 --> 1:50:49.680]  online right now you can find that there is a clinic in spain that is doing o3 therapy with
[1:50:49.680 --> 1:50:55.600]  immense success for anybody that is sick with this particular disease and yet it's against
[1:50:55.600 --> 1:51:00.160]  the fda regulations here in the united instead it's the line from caddy shack snag a tube down
[1:51:00.160 --> 1:51:03.760]  their throat and call me in five or six hours but let's come back when i give me the floor
[1:51:03.760 --> 1:51:08.480]  because you're obviously a smart person derrick biomedical worker at a hospital and i've got the
[1:51:08.480 --> 1:51:15.120]  the articles here a big article by mike adams is excellent on the whole uh new quote dna vaccines
[1:51:15.120 --> 1:51:18.400]  the m rna vaccines we're gonna come back in two minutes we're gonna go right to derrick
[1:51:19.600 --> 1:51:23.600]  and then we've got max keiser popping and then we'll go to bob and robin and andy and dj and
[1:51:23.600 --> 1:51:30.320]  everybody and then paul joseph watson but listen they're censoring this everywhere medical workers
[1:51:30.320 --> 1:51:33.840]  scientists doctors are being blocked people saying anything against the narrative being
[1:51:33.840 --> 1:51:40.000]  blocked that's why this is so precious it's why you spread the word is king i don't like coming to
[1:51:40.000 --> 1:51:44.000]  you every day on the radio and tv stations that you watch and listen to a song and telling you
[1:51:44.000 --> 1:51:48.960]  all these horrible things but you notice almost everything we've talked about horrible has come
[1:51:48.960 --> 1:51:55.760]  true we were warning everybody to try to stop it it's like telling somebody if you got a pool
[1:51:55.760 --> 1:51:59.680]  put a fence around it if you have little kids because even if they're good swimmers they can hit
[1:51:59.680 --> 1:52:04.480]  their head and drown people don't listen they go out and their kids dead in the pool well ladies and
[1:52:04.480 --> 1:52:09.120]  gentlemen this is the death of the third world the collapse of the first world and this is 21st
[1:52:09.120 --> 1:52:15.440]  century warfare carried out by the globalist and they admit they've orchestrated it they admit it's
[1:52:15.440 --> 1:52:20.080]  quote good to save the earth and they're teaching us to be more frugal and they want to make us
[1:52:20.080 --> 1:52:25.680]  poor so they can dictate our surrender to this post-human technocracy i know all this sounds
[1:52:25.680 --> 1:52:31.280]  insane when i was talking about it 25 years ago but now it's public because it's their operations
[1:52:31.280 --> 1:52:36.560]  manual i wish this wasn't the case but they're really our evil psychopaths in control of most
[1:52:36.560 --> 1:52:45.120]  major institutions that we've got to stop them this is the end my friends my only friends the end
[1:52:45.760 --> 1:52:53.360]  of our elaborate plans the end of everything that stands the end the safety the dilution
[1:52:53.360 --> 1:53:01.600]  it's all over ladies and gentlemen because there was only the mirage of safety movies and partying
[1:53:01.600 --> 1:53:07.840]  and living like children never growing up never caring about other people this delivered us into
[1:53:07.840 --> 1:53:13.520]  the hands of tyranny just like the history book show us just like the bible states every time israel
[1:53:13.520 --> 1:53:19.200]  became corrupt and evil and turned away from god they were brought into captivity because their
[1:53:19.200 --> 1:53:24.960]  people sold out to special interests that were infiltrated by spies and then they were enslaved
[1:53:25.680 --> 1:53:32.320]  we are repeating that again today compliance and going along with this system leads to absolute
[1:53:32.320 --> 1:53:38.400]  bondage info wars has decided to fight for freedom info wars has had great victory thanks to your
[1:53:38.400 --> 1:53:54.320]  support and your prayers you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:53:54.320 --> 1:54:07.600]  welcome back i'm your host alex jones next segment ilhan ohmarr has come out and made
[1:54:07.600 --> 1:54:13.920]  us a comment that dub tells for their democrats that she doesn't care if night and rage women he's
[1:54:13.920 --> 1:54:22.480]  a good guy well we know lady you love somali your family helped run criminal activities there
[1:54:22.480 --> 1:54:28.720]  are now you're here in the happy hunting land derrick is a very informed biomedical worker
[1:54:28.720 --> 1:54:32.240]  you got four minutes till berika four and a half minutes you've got the floor tell us what
[1:54:32.240 --> 1:54:40.080]  you're witnessing out in california loads of fear i see people with fear i don't wear mask and when i
[1:54:40.080 --> 1:54:46.800]  go to costco and purposely don't walk in the with a mask on the workers they don't say anything to me
[1:54:46.800 --> 1:54:50.480]  everyone looks around the only people that put me down are other health care workers they're
[1:54:50.480 --> 1:54:55.600]  they come in and scrubs they say you're not wearing a mask and they don't want to get into
[1:54:55.600 --> 1:54:59.920]  it with me but uh also the farmers market you can't you can't really much do anything unless
[1:54:59.920 --> 1:55:05.760]  you're you're following the santa clara county health guidelines which are are pretty egregious
[1:55:05.760 --> 1:55:11.840]  against human rights the most egregious thing i really strongly feel is this shutdown of churches
[1:55:11.840 --> 1:55:20.960]  because the power of prayer is a deep human trait that we all deserve to get back to and i'm sure
[1:55:20.960 --> 1:55:26.880]  everyone listening to this knows about it but we deserve to pray it's a psychic connection to god
[1:55:26.880 --> 1:55:34.240]  it's it's real communication it's it's it's it's the sixth sense absolutely and when we tap into
[1:55:34.240 --> 1:55:40.480]  this power and we all have this power we were born with it if we weren't taught how to use it growing
[1:55:40.480 --> 1:55:45.440]  up that's a that's a travesty we all deserve to know that we can in silence and solitude or wherever
[1:55:45.440 --> 1:55:50.000]  we are we can always have a prayer active in going and the globalists know that they fight
[1:55:50.000 --> 1:55:57.040]  constantly to cut us off from that power that and five g is about that we're moving into a time
[1:55:57.040 --> 1:56:01.920]  right now where humanity is going to make a bump and we're going to get a bump in light and we have
[1:56:01.920 --> 1:56:08.240]  been getting bumps in light and look what they do to the sky they're putting them with chemicals
[1:56:08.240 --> 1:56:13.840]  over here in california it just disgusts me and i i weep to see that that's to be classified there is
[1:56:13.840 --> 1:56:19.840]  a global darkening project that's made the earth 30 darker the exact they're physically trying to
[1:56:19.840 --> 1:56:26.000]  make it dark yep and load us up with the more metals so that these five g towers that are
[1:56:26.000 --> 1:56:32.400]  popping up all over the bay area can somehow influence us more and keep us cordoned off
[1:56:32.400 --> 1:56:41.200]  and spiritually dead this is why i pray i pray daily almost non-stop and i encourage everyone
[1:56:41.200 --> 1:56:49.760]  listening to reach out with your heart to the soul of this universe that those in power can make a new
[1:56:49.760 --> 1:56:57.760]  choice that they can choose to be free and free the rest of us and alex i just want to thank you
[1:56:57.760 --> 1:57:03.840]  for having keys on and some other individuals that show us this power spirituality and your
[1:57:03.840 --> 1:57:08.960]  spirituality is always eked through everything that you do and your authenticity is so refreshing
[1:57:09.600 --> 1:57:14.240]  and i definitely we have to make a plug here for some of the things that you sell i haven't taken
[1:57:14.240 --> 1:57:21.760]  them for years that dna force that that is some some serious medicine and it is incredibly inexpensive
[1:57:21.760 --> 1:57:25.440]  and i don't get how you can sell it for what you're selling it for but there's some secret stuff
[1:57:25.440 --> 1:57:29.920]  in there that everyone needs to wake up to and if you're coupling that with o3 therapy which is ozone
[1:57:29.920 --> 1:57:35.600]  therapy and you haven't touched on it too much alex but no i saw the studies they did in brazil
[1:57:35.600 --> 1:57:41.040]  and spain and and in germany on that i mean that just knocks it out but again they don't want somebody
[1:57:41.040 --> 1:57:47.680]  cured they want people sick forever yeah yep well let me ask you this though if we got a break here
[1:57:47.680 --> 1:57:53.600]  you're making great points this all looks scary and i'm really upset about it i get mad too but
[1:57:53.600 --> 1:57:58.400]  but i see this is badly coordinated and falling apart they got a bunch of sheep following what
[1:57:58.400 --> 1:58:02.960]  they're doing but the awakening is pretty big so i want people to not be too down as well because
[1:58:02.960 --> 1:58:07.360]  i get down myself but i gotta realize there's a lot of innings left in this baseball game
[1:58:09.360 --> 1:58:15.600]  uh they they went too soon alex everyone i talked to was awake and this wasn't so two years ago
[1:58:16.560 --> 1:58:21.120]  two years ago most people didn't care and rarely did i ever see anything maga and the the
[1:58:21.120 --> 1:58:29.680]  the i try to wake people up wherever i go my my bmw has a alex jones bumper sticker nobody else
[1:58:29.680 --> 1:58:34.960]  is wearing anything similar i i wake up wherever i can possibly plant those beans but right now
[1:58:35.680 --> 1:58:42.640]  you know what these guys have done is is hilarious because now hold on hold on finish that point

[1:59:46.240 --> 2:00:05.040]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[2:00:16.560 --> 2:00:21.440]  who wants to push me around his enemy
[2:00:26.800 --> 2:00:31.120]  all right max keiser is about to have some huge breaking news as we get him on skype
[2:00:31.120 --> 2:00:35.760]  from his undisclosed location when i was finishing up with derrick a biomedical worker at a hospital
[2:00:35.760 --> 2:00:39.840]  on covid-19 saying it's a giant hoax we've not screened your calls that's what every medical
[2:00:39.840 --> 2:00:43.760]  worker that calls in for months says empty hospitals they're ordered to put people that
[2:00:43.760 --> 2:00:49.040]  have other diseases as covid-19 new york times puts up names people that died of gunshot wounds
[2:00:49.040 --> 2:00:55.600]  of covid-19 gunshot victims count as coronavirus deaths in washington state not just in new york
[2:00:55.600 --> 2:01:01.520]  it's it's it's everywhere but what i've seen as negative as the clampdown is the police state
[2:01:01.520 --> 2:01:08.320]  the depression they're causing i've never seen such an awakening i was in a just tell the story
[2:01:08.320 --> 2:01:12.640]  true i was in a liquor store my wife about two weeks ago getting some beer and wine for a party
[2:01:12.640 --> 2:01:18.720]  friends were gonna have and i'm in there and there's like 40 people in there and they just mob me
[2:01:18.720 --> 2:01:22.320]  they're all like i used to think we're full of it i'm a liberal you're right it's all a scam it's
[2:01:22.320 --> 2:01:28.720]  all a fraud that's what's going on here ladies and gentlemen there's a huge awakening people really
[2:01:28.720 --> 2:01:33.200]  get now this is a clampdown this is a fraud this is a hoax so uh briefly derrick finish your point
[2:01:34.240 --> 2:01:40.160]  you're seeing that you've seen just an explosion of awakening explosion there's not a single person
[2:01:40.160 --> 2:01:44.880]  i talked to that doesn't say this isn't fake now they're done these people here in california
[2:01:44.880 --> 2:01:50.080]  we're done the bay area you want to talk about i think the group that's the most effective of it
[2:01:50.080 --> 2:01:55.920]  the hispanics there's such a hardworking group of people and they're all out of work 80 or more
[2:01:55.920 --> 2:02:01.120]  here i think it's 85 in california they're out of work the hispanic community they're they're
[2:02:01.120 --> 2:02:06.400]  sitting here they're they're living on their retirement and savings and they see right through
[2:02:06.400 --> 2:02:11.120]  it and then this is the probably the oh it's total seeds to make us dependent this day
[2:02:13.520 --> 2:02:19.600]  the thing is is if they don't finish this off with some sort of coup de grace coming from the
[2:02:19.600 --> 2:02:25.840]  uppers they're they're gonna lose it's done because everyone is so awake now and no and you can't
[2:02:25.840 --> 2:02:31.280]  fool people twice they're not going to be able to do this again and new sums gotta go and i'm not
[2:02:31.280 --> 2:02:39.040]  the only one to think that gavin newson american psycho that guy is drunk on power and everyone
[2:02:39.040 --> 2:02:44.560]  around him in that Pelosi crime gang we need to kick them out i think everyone knows what's
[2:02:44.560 --> 2:02:48.560]  going on right now enough to when the next voting round comes this is why they're gonna have to do
[2:02:48.560 --> 2:02:53.920]  paper ballot votes and they they see it coming they know that they're not popular for goodness sake
[2:02:53.920 --> 2:03:00.800]  the sun heals and we can't go to the beaches we have there's people there's patrols that go up and down
[2:03:00.800 --> 2:03:05.440]  the beaches that make people who are laying out on on the sand get off they know exactly what they're

[2:03:48.080 --> 2:03:54.080]  doing buying six trillion in junk assets and speculation it goes to 100 trillion what is the
[2:03:54.080 --> 2:03:59.920]  update on the casino good log is america being taken private by private equity and we're going to
[2:03:59.920 --> 2:04:05.760]  talk about uh the cantina lean in there as i'm pronouncing that right people getting rich off the
[2:04:07.920 --> 2:04:13.360]  effect velocity of money collapsing no economic fatality the rich hoarding and all deflationary
[2:04:13.360 --> 2:04:19.040]  spiral of global monetary and trade system is stuck in so max keiser great to have you hear
[2:04:19.040 --> 2:04:27.520]  my friend alex jones uh great to be on with you again my friend my good friend alex jones uh what
[2:04:27.520 --> 2:04:33.920]  what's happening well i got max keiser on who's a smart cookie what's really going on is trump good
[2:04:33.920 --> 2:04:37.600]  is trump bad what's happening with the economy what's happening with the trillions there they
[2:04:37.600 --> 2:04:46.160]  keep saying they're putting into the economy the lockdown this this term right well uh let's
[2:04:46.160 --> 2:04:51.760]  go back to uh kind of update the conversation that we've been having i think we've been having
[2:04:51.760 --> 2:04:58.080]  this now for seven or eight years and it has to do with the american economy the global economy
[2:04:58.080 --> 2:05:05.040]  and it has to do with money itself so what we what we have experiencing right now in the us
[2:05:05.040 --> 2:05:13.200]  is that uh there's a huge boom in the stock market and that uh boom is benefiting a very
[2:05:13.200 --> 2:05:18.160]  select few of billionaires or what we call cantillionaires and i'll explain what that means
[2:05:18.160 --> 2:05:24.560]  in a second meanwhile as you read the unemployment rates are skyrocketing and people are suffering
[2:05:24.560 --> 2:05:31.920]  they're forced to shelter at home and deprived of basic sunlight but somehow the top one percent
[2:05:31.920 --> 2:05:36.960]  one percent of the one percent is making out hundreds of millions hundreds of billions of
[2:05:36.960 --> 2:05:41.520]  dollars are pouring into these pockets so the establishment is waging war on us and
[2:05:41.520 --> 2:05:47.680]  vertically integrating everything right now yeah basically uh you know let's get back to a basic
[2:05:47.680 --> 2:05:55.520]  point about fiat money uh it's the the economy can be described as the creation of debt money
[2:05:55.520 --> 2:06:01.520]  and all fiat money is debt money when the creation of debt money is slower than the rate at which
[2:06:01.520 --> 2:06:07.280]  it's collapsing the bond market's collapsing or the the economy is collapsing uh then you have
[2:06:07.840 --> 2:06:13.120]  economic pullback and you have a stock market pullback when the debt money is being created at
[2:06:13.120 --> 2:06:21.120]  a faster rate then it's it's underlying economy is deteriorating then you have the stock market
[2:06:21.120 --> 2:06:26.320]  rally but at the end of the day it's still debt money and all debt money for the past 300 years
[2:06:26.320 --> 2:06:31.920]  all fiat debt money has gone to zero including the british pound which has lost okay 98 percent
[2:06:31.920 --> 2:06:36.320]  of its purchasing power over the past so now knowing that it's demise was here it's waging
[2:06:36.320 --> 2:06:42.160]  war against the real economy making us think it that we need it so this is really about making
[2:06:42.160 --> 2:06:48.240]  us take on more more their loans well anytime anytime a dollar is introduced into the economy
[2:06:48.240 --> 2:06:56.400]  the debt is increased and the canceling effect is uh how this uh wealth transfer takes place so
[2:06:57.040 --> 2:07:01.200]  the way that the fiat money is distributed the debt money is distributed is distributed through
[2:07:01.200 --> 2:07:06.240]  the banks through the wall street banks that's where it goes first and the bankers and their
[2:07:06.240 --> 2:07:12.960]  friends they use their fiat gift from the central bank to buy back their own stock so their own
[2:07:12.960 --> 2:07:18.400]  stocks go up in value and it could be apple could be microsoft it could be any of the large
[2:07:18.400 --> 2:07:22.800]  corporations they buy back their own stock with the free money they get from the central bank
[2:07:22.800 --> 2:07:27.040]  and of course all the executives have stock options tied to the current stock price but
[2:07:27.040 --> 2:07:32.560]  they only pay a one dollar for an option so if the stock goes up 20 bucks that one dollar option
[2:07:32.560 --> 2:07:38.960]  is not worth 20 bucks they made 20 x and so this is how the game so why couldn't obama do it at the
[2:07:38.960 --> 2:07:43.840]  level trump is why does he establish with so mad at trump but then he's doing exactly what you think
[2:07:43.840 --> 2:07:52.080]  they want well during obama's administration he had to repeal a lot of things uh in the law to
[2:07:52.080 --> 2:07:57.120]  make this easier uh he had to get rid of glass steagle that happened during clinton which is a
[2:07:57.120 --> 2:08:02.400]  part of the democratic establishment also the commodity futures modernization act will legalize
[2:08:02.400 --> 2:08:08.160]  financial gambling that had to be introduced he had to do a lot of uh work getting rid of some of
[2:08:08.160 --> 2:08:13.360]  the regulations uh that obama was instrumental in getting rid of to clear the playing field
[2:08:13.360 --> 2:08:18.160]  so that these bankers now have a lawless environment a ruleless environment there's
[2:08:18.160 --> 2:08:23.280]  there's no law that's there are laws in place alex but none of them are being enforced right so
[2:08:23.280 --> 2:08:29.040]  like a jamie diamond at jp morgan he's now worth a couple of billion dollars and he got there by
[2:08:29.040 --> 2:08:36.800]  breaking the law and we know that because he's had to uh face criminal charges many times uh
[2:08:36.800 --> 2:08:43.200]  that were paid off with a fine or civil civil charge that was paid off with a fine uh so his
[2:08:43.200 --> 2:08:49.120]  business model is to keep 90 cents of every dollar he steals and that's the business model of america
[2:08:49.120 --> 2:08:54.800]  most businesses in america follow this money laundering kind of fake economy even the bank of
[2:08:54.800 --> 2:09:00.400]  america recently said that they they accused the federal reserve bank of engaging in fake markets
[2:09:00.400 --> 2:09:05.840]  another fake market that's similar is the fracking market they lose incredible amount of money on
[2:09:05.840 --> 2:09:10.640]  every dollar they spend the fracking industry has never been profitable it's never been cash flow
[2:09:10.640 --> 2:09:17.120]  possibly everybody knows wall catting it's a speculative deal but fracking is uniquely uh money
[2:09:17.120 --> 2:09:23.280]  losing in the wild catting you might you might hit a well one out of a 50 or one out of 20 and it
[2:09:23.280 --> 2:09:27.920]  pays for itself okay that's different than fracking fracking we know that the amount of capital that
[2:09:27.920 --> 2:09:33.120]  goes in no i was just another example so stay there let's come back and talk about where it's
[2:09:33.120 --> 2:09:38.240]  going next this is all really important folks but now they want to kill the real economy to feed it
[2:09:38.240 --> 2:09:43.280]  to wall street even though we all starved to death they'll still be quotillionaires we'll be right back
[2:09:43.280 --> 2:09:50.480]  stay with us i've hunted a lot of big game at long distances with high caliber rifles and
[2:09:51.200 --> 2:09:56.800]  when you shoot an elk at say 600 yards even if you hit them right in the heart they'll still run
[2:09:56.800 --> 2:10:04.560]  50 60 70 maybe 100 yards they've got that adrenaline pumping through their arteries and
[2:10:04.560 --> 2:10:09.840]  through their veins but all of a sudden they slow down they realize what's happened they fall over
[2:10:09.840 --> 2:10:15.920]  and they die then you go bag them and haul them back in well that's what's going to happen to the
[2:10:15.920 --> 2:10:22.560]  entire world now and that's what the economic numbers show is that we've been shot right in the
[2:10:22.560 --> 2:10:28.880]  heart and for the first world it's going to mean a long horrible depression and a lot of death well
[2:10:28.880 --> 2:10:32.560]  for the third world it's going to mean probably over 100 million dead according to you and i believe
[2:10:32.560 --> 2:10:38.240]  their numbers because it's the very un that's orchestrated this to depopulate the third world
[2:10:38.240 --> 2:10:42.000]  so that all the leftists had thought it was their revolution to get rid of trump you're a bunch of
[2:10:42.000 --> 2:10:47.200]  suckers and you've bought into something better than what hitler did when it comes to regaining

[2:12:08.320 --> 2:12:16.240]  cantillionaires max keiser is here to define it for us he's got swan bitcoing.com
[2:12:16.240 --> 2:12:22.320]  port slash keiser is the main site i want you to visit okay so max look i want to be a fan of
[2:12:22.320 --> 2:12:27.280]  trump and the fact is i've been persecuted really bad for being a trump supporter so i'm kind of
[2:12:27.280 --> 2:12:33.520]  pig at it it makes me want to support him more quite frankly if i hadn't been persecuted so much i
[2:12:33.520 --> 2:12:39.280]  probably wouldn't support trump as much so to be aware of my own sick psychology obviously i like
[2:12:39.280 --> 2:12:44.080]  him better than hillary obviously i'm trying to be disruptive the globalist but trump keeps trying
[2:12:44.080 --> 2:12:48.000]  to give walsh what they want they don't appreciate that because they want the money and they want
[2:12:48.000 --> 2:12:52.880]  the power but don't just go along with my view what is your real view let me let's take the gloves
[2:12:52.880 --> 2:12:56.800]  off and we'll get into all the issues with you and you're trying to get to it as we came to break
[2:12:56.800 --> 2:13:01.600]  what the hell's going on with trump allowing the censorship now of the word pandemic if you're not
[2:13:01.600 --> 2:13:08.240]  an approved site you can't even type that into twitter or or or youtube now youtube is blocking
[2:13:08.240 --> 2:13:14.880]  what the communist party says to block that's big news today i mean it's like it isn't just alex jones
[2:13:14.880 --> 2:13:22.320]  being censored now this it's everyone in libtime surveillance totally draconian social credit scores
[2:13:22.320 --> 2:13:30.080]  they're using the covet 19 for the world digital currency uh bill gates has his own crypto what in
[2:13:30.080 --> 2:13:37.760]  hades is the big picture right well uh trump only really looks at one metric and that's the stock market
[2:13:37.760 --> 2:13:43.840]  that's what he he engages his self his approval and his own self-worth on the stock market you
[2:13:43.840 --> 2:13:48.560]  know he's a guy from new york he grew up he came of age during the 1980s when the stock market boomed
[2:13:49.120 --> 2:13:54.400]  and the world's kind of focused on stock markets as we had a transition from an industrial and
[2:13:54.400 --> 2:13:59.520]  agricultural economy to a financialized economy the stock market becomes the center of everyone's
[2:13:59.520 --> 2:14:07.600]  financial consciousness and that dow jones index average is tells you minute by minute how you do
[2:14:07.600 --> 2:14:12.720]  in life and what you're worth and so when he does everything he can to pump stocks he's a stock
[2:14:12.720 --> 2:14:18.720]  pumper and he's done a great job in pumping stocks unfortunately that means he's pulled the federal
[2:14:18.720 --> 2:14:25.760]  reserve bank to uh go into their money printing scheme to print a lot of money money printer go
[2:14:25.760 --> 2:14:31.840]  burr over there i'm all for laze fair and big markets and i get they build things and enthusiasm
[2:14:31.840 --> 2:14:39.920]  bills but like you were saying no it's not but it's burning made off on pcp though when it's
[2:14:39.920 --> 2:14:44.400]  all a fraud and we just give it all the power it's going to destroy us sorry go ahead right it's not
[2:14:44.400 --> 2:14:49.440]  it's not building anything it's not laze fair capitalism it's it's the furthest thing from
[2:14:49.440 --> 2:14:55.760]  laze fair free market capitalism because all this free money printing that's awarded to the insiders
[2:14:55.760 --> 2:15:00.160]  who use it to buy back their own stock and run away it's crony capitalism it's rig
[2:15:00.960 --> 2:15:06.880]  right and what that does is has two effects not only does it award the least talented amongst us
[2:15:06.880 --> 2:15:11.520]  but entrepreneurs get crowded out because they don't have access to that capital because that
[2:15:11.520 --> 2:15:17.600]  all that capital is going to the crony capitalist the kleptocracy so the the base of new enterprises
[2:15:17.600 --> 2:15:22.800]  and all the thousands of small to medium-sized enterprises in america are starving for capital
[2:15:22.800 --> 2:15:28.160]  right now and that means that's the seed stock that's america in 20 years 30 years the next point
[2:15:28.160 --> 2:15:33.840]  that this ultra rich that hoard the money and put it back into the fraud right and you can see it
[2:15:33.840 --> 2:15:38.160]  clearly in what's called a money velocity chart if you do a quick search you know your staff over
[2:15:38.160 --> 2:15:44.640]  there for money velocity money it'll do a quick and you'll see it goes crashing straight down
[2:15:44.640 --> 2:15:50.400]  that is the kind of the ekg chart of how the american economy is doing if money velocity
[2:15:50.400 --> 2:15:55.520]  goes up that means that small to medium-sized enterprises are building and borrowing and
[2:15:55.520 --> 2:15:59.920]  building and borrowing and they're working if it's crashing as you can see by this chart now it means
[2:15:59.920 --> 2:16:05.040]  that the insiders the cantillionaires as i call them are hoarding the cash they're not loaning it
[2:16:05.040 --> 2:16:09.360]  out the small to medium-sized enterprises and they're just buying their own stock back so i was
[2:16:09.360 --> 2:16:13.920]  about to say i looked at the bill on the gates report that came out last week on their tax free
[2:16:13.920 --> 2:16:21.600]  foundation of what it bought and it's it's no more farming or ranching or industry or service
[2:16:21.600 --> 2:16:27.680]  it's all big tech that's it and medical so they they are completely exiting a real economy and
[2:16:27.680 --> 2:16:32.480]  doubling down the fraudulent one exactly what you're saying right they're creating what i call the
[2:16:32.480 --> 2:16:37.840]  casino gulag which is a term i coined on your show a few years ago and the casino gulag is
[2:16:37.840 --> 2:16:43.440]  thriving right now people are sheltering at home and they're forced to go online and the the model
[2:16:43.440 --> 2:16:48.960]  here is if you click on an ad you might get a protein pill or you're going to starve to death
[2:16:48.960 --> 2:16:53.840]  and you won't be able to go outside and remember that for every dollar you click an ad on a site
[2:16:53.840 --> 2:17:00.000]  like facebook facebook corporation can use that revenue recurring revenue stream to borrow a hundred
[2:17:00.000 --> 2:17:05.360]  thousand dollars from the central bank so that's how the leverage works against everybody who's not
[2:17:05.360 --> 2:17:10.960]  an insider at these major tech companies it's all based on buying back your own stock getting free
[2:17:10.960 --> 2:17:16.880]  money from the fed and imposing this casino gulag model and not making capital available to small
[2:17:16.880 --> 2:17:24.400]  to medium enterprises and you end up with a neo feudalism neo feudalism so now he's got wealth
[2:17:24.400 --> 2:17:31.600]  concentrated amongst an extraordinarily few number of people in america and that's ultimately bad
[2:17:31.600 --> 2:17:37.840]  because you end up with feudalism and you have basically serfs and it also penalizes as you said
[2:17:37.840 --> 2:17:44.080]  innovation and productivity now so i mean where does this end then what is your what is your
[2:17:45.360 --> 2:17:50.960]  analysis i started out i started out by saying you know let's review the history of money
[2:17:50.960 --> 2:17:56.560]  all fiat money is debt money none has survived in past 300 years okay so what is money there's
[2:17:56.560 --> 2:18:00.000]  only two forms of money right now that are worth anything gold and we know why gold's
[2:18:00.000 --> 2:18:04.240]  worth something it's been worth something for thousands of years and bitcoin right bitcoin
[2:18:04.240 --> 2:18:10.560]  is the new goal it's goal 2.0 the way it came about was something of an industrial accident
[2:18:11.200 --> 2:18:16.560]  you know programmers are trying to figure out how to create digital files that you couldn't copy
[2:18:17.280 --> 2:18:22.240]  and what they accidentally stumbled into was the hardest money ever in the history of humankind
[2:18:22.240 --> 2:18:27.200]  and now it's become this Godzilla currency monster that's competing with gold
[2:18:27.200 --> 2:18:30.960]  isn't that the essence of value something you can't copy that means the genuine
[2:18:30.960 --> 2:18:37.360]  exactly that's right you want you're right you don't want to be easily counterfeit your money
[2:18:37.360 --> 2:18:42.320]  right like the Fed they just print if Donald Trump calls up Jay Powell and says i'm really
[2:18:42.320 --> 2:18:47.280]  unhappy with the stock market being down 2% today can you please print another four trillion dollars
[2:18:47.280 --> 2:18:53.200]  of phony fiat US dollar money please and so the corporations can buy back their own stock with free
[2:18:53.200 --> 2:18:57.360]  money and make the stock market go up please because that's the only thing i look at that's the only
[2:18:57.360 --> 2:19:03.360]  thing i look at but alex here's the deal we've talked about bitcoin for a few years and so today

[2:20:12.880 --> 2:20:17.520]  money that's yours and and to take care of your family so when i told you i like i get the concept
[2:20:17.520 --> 2:20:22.080]  of bitcoin i don't like the speculation the wars but this is what i'm talking about you're on the
[2:20:22.080 --> 2:20:27.200]  show and i knew you probably plugged bitcoin but now promo code alex promo code alex here they're
[2:20:27.200 --> 2:20:32.000]  gonna have the damn fbi coming out of black helicopters are probably six hours over this i
[2:20:32.000 --> 2:20:35.840]  don't even know i don't even know you're ready to fight the war you don't understand max you
[2:20:35.840 --> 2:20:41.440]  understand if i wipe my ass wrong the freaking fence i thought you were ready to go into the
[2:20:41.440 --> 2:20:57.360]  the ring okay yeah money if i'm going to prison where's my paycheck
[2:21:03.360 --> 2:21:08.400]  all right max kaiser is a really interesting fella and i've been having him on the air for
[2:21:08.400 --> 2:21:13.680]  i don't know probably 15 years and he's here with us and i knew he'd come on today and talk about
[2:21:13.680 --> 2:21:18.880]  bitcoin and you've had like shiff over there when i had him on a few months ago like oh jones
[2:21:18.880 --> 2:21:25.120]  endorses bitcoin he he sold out after years of not selling out i haven't gotten a dollar from bitcoin
[2:21:25.120 --> 2:21:30.720]  i'm not in the stock market i'm not in bitcoin i ran into max kaiser in austin texas and i said
[2:21:30.720 --> 2:21:35.440]  yeah in fact let's let's put up the graph from the wall street journal of where it was a few years
[2:21:35.440 --> 2:21:39.760]  ago at that big high and they said it was dead and now it's it's gotten you know close to half its
[2:21:39.760 --> 2:21:46.160]  gains back i'm all about new currencies and things that are outside the system but max
[2:21:47.120 --> 2:21:54.960]  again i don't think on your rt show you sit there and go oh my gosh here's my here's your free 10
[2:21:54.960 --> 2:22:00.160]  dollars worth of bitcoin for people with the name alex when they go to that is that for alex
[2:22:00.160 --> 2:22:05.760]  jones show or is that for alexander the great alexander grand bell alexander the toqueful
[2:22:05.760 --> 2:22:12.560]  who is this right alexander that's endorsing this exactly it's it's just that it's a it's a generic
[2:22:12.560 --> 2:22:18.080]  alex it's generic it doesn't refer to any individual living or dead well no i'll be here's the thing
[2:22:18.080 --> 2:22:23.920]  i might even matter i'll be accused i'll be accused of some conspiracy with you and then i'm trying
[2:22:23.920 --> 2:22:29.760]  to pump bitcoin up here i don't even know anything about this you can't it's too it's already beyond
[2:22:29.760 --> 2:22:35.200]  the ability of any one individual to affect the price you know it's become sewn into the fabric
[2:22:35.200 --> 2:22:41.920]  of the global economy and those who uh don't want to get involved are going to find that all of their
[2:22:41.920 --> 2:22:46.480]  fiat money no i'm learning that whether you want to be involved or not you are okay okay well how
[2:22:46.480 --> 2:22:51.280]  much bitcoin do i get today on the show from max geyser one thing i've learned with these
[2:22:51.280 --> 2:22:58.800]  big people i can guarantee i can give you ten dollars with the bitcoin by clicking on kaiser

[2:23:08.800 --> 2:23:14.480]  trolling alex jones which is an entertaining entertaining thing you know i i'm just up here
[2:23:14.480 --> 2:23:18.880]  trying to promote american freedom and trying to expose what's because i agree with you on your
[2:23:18.880 --> 2:23:24.640]  market analysis and what's going to happen to the economy but right because of the problem is
[2:23:24.640 --> 2:23:29.440]  the money alex that's what i've been saying for six seven eight nine ten years the root cause
[2:23:29.440 --> 2:23:35.440]  is this fiat money and unless you have a solution for that you're going to be always on the losing
[2:23:35.440 --> 2:23:40.800]  end and because you are righteous and you are holy and bitcoin is holy that i've learned about this
[2:23:40.800 --> 2:23:45.600]  major promotion for the first time here live on air i just looked at the track record and i just
[2:23:45.600 --> 2:23:50.000]  looked at what's been going on i've been right for you know ten years i've been talking nine years
[2:23:50.000 --> 2:23:54.320]  i've been talking about it and i haven't been wrong yet let me ask you this tremendous track
[2:23:54.320 --> 2:24:00.480]  record let me ask you this nine years peter schiff's been wrong for nine years he's been wrong
[2:24:00.480 --> 2:24:05.920]  for nine well i haven't got my say i haven't gotten my check from him promoting his chinese stocks yet
[2:24:05.920 --> 2:24:16.000]  either well um you know he he he's lax in his analysis and he's in able to provide any kind of
[2:24:16.000 --> 2:24:25.840]  worthwhile let's just say he's not good yeah but sometimes you have to look past the media
[2:24:25.840 --> 2:24:31.280]  gratification i believe you and the bigger picture are you are you in the in the interest of the
[2:24:31.280 --> 2:24:36.720]  wider interest of your audience as a whole beyond any short-term and media gratification
[2:24:36.720 --> 2:24:41.920]  then you'd see that this is a solution to take everybody out of them of the malaise short term
[2:24:41.920 --> 2:24:47.440]  dude i can't bet on something but let me explain something that's what i'm saying stop stop let me
[2:24:47.440 --> 2:24:53.680]  talk it's not a bet don't feel about it lifestyle change if i'm promoting vitamin b3 that that is
[2:24:53.680 --> 2:25:01.040]  essential i know it works or vitamin c or pqq or goku dinner iodine that stuff i know
[2:25:01.040 --> 2:25:05.600]  i'm giving people a sure bet i'm not saying people are bad to get bitcoin they just better
[2:25:05.600 --> 2:25:10.240]  not bet the the mortgage on it that's all i'm saying is for me it's a speculative thing and
[2:25:10.240 --> 2:25:13.200]  and so that's why i think it might be interesting people get a small piece of it just to see what
[2:25:13.200 --> 2:25:18.080]  happens with it i just exactly that's what i'm saying you know i just learned about this on the
[2:25:18.080 --> 2:25:22.000]  date dude you like pick me up at my front door and all of a sudden you got me on the couch my
[2:25:22.000 --> 2:25:26.000]  legs behind my ears and you know i didn't know this was about to happen max you're raping me

[2:25:53.360 --> 2:25:57.440]  i have to agree with the position i have to think it's moral i have to think it's overall a good
[2:25:57.440 --> 2:26:01.440]  bet for my audience i have to understand it i have to tell them and then i got to get paid
[2:26:02.720 --> 2:26:06.480]  because i got to fund this operation to feed all these little baby birds that are very hungry

[2:28:03.760 --> 2:28:09.760]  the problem all right what about the overall economy outside of the universe of bitcoin
[2:28:09.760 --> 2:28:13.760]  what are these globalist bankers these scintillian errors what are they going to do
[2:28:13.760 --> 2:28:18.400]  this party they're building bunkers they're building they know this is untenable why don't
[2:28:18.400 --> 2:28:23.840]  they try to stabilize things why are they doing this well because it's working right it's working
[2:28:23.840 --> 2:28:29.920]  this system is it's a it's a it's working for them why would they stop they were able you know
[2:28:29.920 --> 2:28:38.160]  in 1929 the stock market crashed and then during the 1930s during the securities act of 1933-1934
[2:28:38.160 --> 2:28:44.000]  all new regulations were put in place to put a collar to put a muzzle a leash on wall street
[2:28:44.000 --> 2:28:49.280]  to stop wall street from doing what it did in the 20s to bankrupt america well since that time in
[2:28:49.280 --> 2:28:53.840]  subsequent decades and administrations all these were taken off and they gave methamphetamine to
[2:28:53.840 --> 2:29:00.720]  pitbull all removed exactly and so now you've got this out of control a voracious monster that all
[2:29:00.720 --> 2:29:06.240]  it wants is that free fed money and it in any time you deprive it of another trillion or two
[2:29:06.240 --> 2:29:11.680]  from the central bank they crashed the stock market and then cnbc will say the market's crashing
[2:29:12.240 --> 2:29:16.480]  trump do something and then so they're holding his hostage and and trump's greatest failing
[2:29:16.480 --> 2:29:21.760]  right is that he is but what is he supposed to do if he didn't know we're being held hostage by
[2:29:21.760 --> 2:29:26.560]  the system and the only way the system works is if you can print ad nauseam if you can print
[2:29:26.560 --> 2:29:31.760]  infinite amounts of fiat money with no checks and balances like the system is now because the gold
[2:29:31.760 --> 2:29:37.840]  standard when it finally goes belly up literally obliterate in 1971 so you look at a chart of inflation
[2:29:37.840 --> 2:29:43.920]  and wages look at how wages since 1971 before 1971 wages and inflation were roughly parallel
[2:29:43.920 --> 2:29:50.400]  they're moving up in lockstep 1971 america closed the gold window oh suddenly wages go nowhere for
[2:29:50.400 --> 2:29:57.520]  45 years and financialization on wall street oh we've got thousands of billionaires right that's
[2:29:57.520 --> 2:30:02.800]  what happened that's what needs to be fixed yeah we fed the middle class power who will fix it now
[2:30:03.360 --> 2:30:09.360]  Pelosi or congress they are trading on this information and becoming fabulously rich they're
[2:30:09.360 --> 2:30:15.600]  gonna not gonna stop it ilex obviously they're they're the ones that that's the problem ron paul
[2:30:15.600 --> 2:30:21.040]  he was the only and the last voice in congress that stood up and said we need to audit the fed
[2:30:21.040 --> 2:30:26.640]  we need to examine our money we need to return to hard money he's not there anymore yeah trump
[2:30:26.640 --> 2:30:33.040]  didn't take control of that he literally merged with it we'll be right back one of the best nutrients

[2:32:55.440 --> 2:33:00.240]  i hope trump with his initiatives can clean this up and fix it but with the election fraud and the
[2:33:00.240 --> 2:33:04.800]  covid-19 all the wars and the third world collapsing and everything else is going on

[2:34:05.360 --> 2:34:11.040]  are now non-essential and a prisoner from the beginning of my research it was clear the globalist
[2:34:11.040 --> 2:34:17.040]  are an authoritarian anti-human group they have to put this electronic straightjacket on us before
[2:34:17.040 --> 2:34:23.760]  they carry out their in game which is global depopulation so you see submitting to them is
[2:34:23.760 --> 2:34:30.640]  death the only way to stop them is to expose them to hate their guts and realize they are humanity's

[2:35:24.720 --> 2:35:28.400]  other people offered it to me and i'm saying listen it's not that i'm refusing it if i got
[2:35:28.400 --> 2:35:32.960]  involved in stock or something i'd become so obsessed with it that i would never stop paying
[2:35:32.960 --> 2:35:38.240]  attention to it so i paid attention to information and what's going on politically but but i mean
[2:35:38.240 --> 2:35:42.640]  surely from where he promoted it was worth nothing to you know it was one of the biggest
[2:35:42.640 --> 2:35:45.920]  things the market a few years ago he said it would go back up people said it wouldn't and has
[2:35:45.920 --> 2:35:52.000]  gone back up i'm not and i'm not here not promoting it because shiff and people attack it and say that
[2:35:52.000 --> 2:35:56.480]  i'm you know something as a bitcoin scammer nothing it's shiff it's just it's just very childlike
[2:35:57.200 --> 2:36:01.760]  uh it it's that if i can't understand something and i am kind of a troglodyte in certain levels
[2:36:01.760 --> 2:36:06.320]  i just can't pitch it folks but i think if somebody's given you and then i'm learning about
[2:36:06.320 --> 2:36:11.760]  what this deal is ten dollars of free bitcoin which is a pittance but it's a good little testing model
[2:36:11.760 --> 2:36:14.800]  take my wife's like hey i want to get the stock market i got a little bit of money i want to
[2:36:14.800 --> 2:36:18.880]  say well just you know go do whatever you want just don't put money in there that you can't lose
[2:36:18.880 --> 2:36:25.600]  because it's gambling um and i like the idea i wish bitcoin was legitimate or maybe it is
[2:36:25.600 --> 2:36:30.480]  and i want outside the federal reserve i want alternative systems i totally get the technology
[2:36:30.480 --> 2:36:38.000]  it's amazing my question is all the shark-like promotion evidence today and i think you believe
[2:36:38.000 --> 2:36:42.640]  in your information max you know i don't think you're a bad guy you're really a acolyte you're
[2:36:42.640 --> 2:36:48.640]  like a you're like a founding father of bitcoin uh you are a proselytide you are a priest a high
[2:36:48.640 --> 2:36:54.320]  priest of this uh but but just separately moving away from that and we'll put out the url you wanted
[2:36:54.320 --> 2:36:58.400]  to put out for folks that want to get ten dollars of free bitcoin which i think as long as you take
[2:36:58.400 --> 2:37:02.400]  it is that you know cheese on the mount strap that's fine folks a little bit of a test you know
[2:37:02.400 --> 2:37:05.920]  it's kind of like going to a random whorehouse but no no no no seriously i'm gonna stop being me
[2:37:05.920 --> 2:37:11.440]  let me just ask you this big picture i know i respect your view on the economy you've been
[2:37:11.440 --> 2:37:16.640]  dead on uh you know way better than shift not being mean to shift you know lord and savior over there
[2:37:16.640 --> 2:37:22.240]  but how bad is this gonna get because i see trump is is trying to prop stuff up because the other
[2:37:22.240 --> 2:37:30.800]  alternative is a total depression and it's kind of the best case of two bad choices yeah i i'm
[2:37:30.800 --> 2:37:35.600]  going to get to that let me just make one quick 20 second follow-up to this bitcoin conversation
[2:37:35.600 --> 2:37:42.240]  okay there's two pieces two main pieces to it one is the price and the second main piece
[2:37:42.240 --> 2:37:48.720]  of discussion point about bitcoin is how it relates to the economy as a whole and i think
[2:37:48.720 --> 2:37:53.760]  we could have an entire conversation on how bitcoin relates to the history of money and
[2:37:53.760 --> 2:37:59.520]  the economy as a whole without ever mentioning price the price is the least interesting part
[2:37:59.520 --> 2:38:04.560]  of bitcoin to tell you the truth there's a lot more interesting pieces to it but to get here
[2:38:04.560 --> 2:38:07.680]  why hasn't it been duplicated yet because you've been saying this for nine years it won't be
[2:38:07.680 --> 2:38:11.520]  duplicated you've been proven right there's another problem bitcoin has is all the fake
[2:38:11.520 --> 2:38:17.200]  stuff around it well that anytime you have something valuable people come out with fake
[2:38:17.200 --> 2:38:21.680]  versions of it if you go to you know down to the the the chauvinize and parish you see fake
[2:38:21.680 --> 2:38:28.000]  Gucci bags there's fake gold and pyrite there's fake diamonds anytime someone perceives something
[2:38:28.000 --> 2:38:34.000]  as genuine and real and scarce and desirable there's a lot of fake that comes out to try to
[2:38:34.000 --> 2:38:39.520]  capture in the case of bitcoin it came out in 2009 and since then there have been thousands of
[2:38:39.520 --> 2:38:46.240]  copies and they've all proven to be inadequate and fake and none of them work 11 years so was that
[2:38:46.240 --> 2:38:51.760]  2010 at Bilderberg you offered me all that bitcoin i was too dumb to download it yes i offered your
[2:38:51.760 --> 2:38:58.480]  audience 10 000 bitcoin to give away for free and at that time and you wanted to think about it and
[2:38:58.480 --> 2:39:03.200]  you weren't sure whether that was a good idea and that's now worth you know hundreds of millions of
[2:39:03.200 --> 2:39:10.720]  dollars but but you get my trepidation well that's why i'm not a timid person i charge him what i
[2:39:10.720 --> 2:39:14.960]  know is right and i'm not saying you're bad promoting bitcoin i wish i would have done it
[2:39:14.960 --> 2:39:19.520]  i just know i'm so behind the curve i don't even know what's going on consider this tough love
[2:39:19.520 --> 2:39:24.480]  alec this is tough love i love you so much but sometimes you just got it you know you got a
[2:39:24.480 --> 2:39:29.040]  foot pedal to the metal and just get your friend over the hump you know they're they're shy they're
[2:39:29.040 --> 2:39:33.120]  hesitant they won't take the plunge you know i got it how to push you over the cliff just say look
[2:39:33.120 --> 2:39:41.200]  this is it um this is the real thing you're raping and uh well it's love alec's it's it's love but
[2:39:41.200 --> 2:39:47.440]  the point is that there's an entire joe biden love that can i sniff your hair please here i'll
[2:39:47.440 --> 2:39:54.400]  come over here how long you're on the screen go ahead first seven but the uh oh yeah that's good
[2:39:54.400 --> 2:40:02.880]  oh what's that that's uh why that's my talent oh yeah oh oh yeah that's great oh look a genie's
[2:40:02.880 --> 2:40:10.880]  coming out of your ear but uh to get back to your question about the economy uh is that the reason
[2:40:10.880 --> 2:40:17.760]  why it's hopeless is because to get back to this theme of debt money right when you just float
[2:40:17.760 --> 2:40:23.680]  debt money into the economy you create deflation which means that everything becomes encumbered
[2:40:23.680 --> 2:40:30.000]  with debt right if you have too much debt you have a problem and so america has uh the the debt to
[2:40:30.000 --> 2:40:38.240]  gdp is over a hundred percent around the world the debt to gdp is close to 300 debt to gdp so the
[2:40:38.240 --> 2:40:43.440]  and when you talk to the economists like paul krugman of the new york times or stiglitz or
[2:40:43.440 --> 2:40:48.400]  any of these other high high profile economists they say the way to get out of this deflation
[2:40:48.400 --> 2:40:52.960]  problem is we need to put more of this money need to print more money they need to so what are you
[2:40:52.960 --> 2:40:58.800]  predicting is going to happen just just tell me neofutilism i think that they're going to continue
[2:40:58.800 --> 2:41:04.320]  to print debt so they'll just steal the whole economy and leave us with no economy exactly
[2:41:04.320 --> 2:41:08.800]  right by the way you know how powerful the meme will be if you rub my shoulders and sniff my hair
[2:41:08.800 --> 2:41:11.840]  because we do this live on air right now together just come on i'm selling your

[2:43:02.880 --> 2:43:07.760]  going to be part of the new world order peter schiff is my daddy when he you know he told me
[2:43:07.760 --> 2:43:12.880]  you're bad so that's why you're on the show today he's been wronged for nine years straight he hasn't
[2:43:12.880 --> 2:43:18.000]  been right about a single listen i'm not in a pissing contest he's just like jones finally sold
[2:43:18.000 --> 2:43:25.760]  out for the money and i'm like sold out for the money i want bitcoin to be real i want a currency
[2:43:25.760 --> 2:43:31.120]  they don't control so i go anywhere i want a priest is peter schiff a nun he works he's in
[2:43:31.120 --> 2:43:36.720]  a nunnery praying all day and he's totally outside of the prophet motive i didn't know peter schiff
[2:43:36.720 --> 2:43:43.600]  was a philanthropist he just sits and prays all day in a peter schiff get thee to a nunnery i mean
[2:43:43.600 --> 2:43:50.160]  to accuse somebody else of being uh seeking to be in business is quite rich from a guy who's
[2:43:50.160 --> 2:43:58.880]  been done nothing to rip folks off for 20 straight years i don't think any proof of that uh the proof
[2:43:58.880 --> 2:44:04.320]  is in uh all of his recommendations that when he added all up they go on straight down he just the
[2:44:04.320 --> 2:44:10.640]  last time you're wrong like jones finally sold out to the money in fact that cheque hasn't arrived
[2:44:10.640 --> 2:44:15.520]  yet kaiser all right he's the most over it yeah well let's talk to him about somebody else you
[2:44:15.520 --> 2:44:19.360]  know and pick somebody else to pick on i'm happy to pick on anybody doesn't have to be peter schiff
[2:44:19.360 --> 2:44:24.000]  unfortunately we're out of time at this point paul joseph was just taking over max kaiser thank
[2:44:24.000 --> 2:44:29.040]  you very much you know max is crazy i'm crazy we get together crazy things happen but if you're a
[2:44:29.040 --> 2:44:35.680]  tv viewer you really missed him groping me over there this is a huge bitcoin promotion i have no
[2:44:35.680 --> 2:44:40.160]  doubt that it's just as valuable as the federal reserve notes which means it's faith and credit
[2:44:40.160 --> 2:44:50.240]  what's behind it and that's that and so uh i i i i just uh you know i wasn't gonna get involved
[2:44:50.240 --> 2:44:55.360]  in bitcoin till till schiff told me that i'd sold out to it and i and i'm like that close
[2:44:56.080 --> 2:45:01.840]  just because it's a new currency and i and i just i've watched it it's like why i'm not supposed
[2:45:01.840 --> 2:45:06.320]  to be involved in this but then i was about to do it and kaiser just did that whole
[2:45:06.320 --> 2:45:12.880]  whole this whole audience was just getting right i mean i hope you all realize that it's okay it's
[2:45:12.880 --> 2:45:17.920]  alright at least kaiser's insane he doesn't take himself too seriously and that's important when
[2:45:17.920 --> 2:45:29.440]  you're crazy this is the end my friends my only friends the end of our elaborate plans the end
[2:45:29.440 --> 2:45:37.600]  of everything that stands the end the safety the delusion it's all over ladies and gentlemen
[2:45:38.320 --> 2:45:45.120]  because there was only the mirage of safety movies and partying and living like children
[2:45:45.120 --> 2:45:50.880]  never growing up never caring about other people this delivered us into the hands of tyranny
[2:45:51.520 --> 2:45:56.160]  just like the history book show it's just like the bible states every time israel became corrupt
[2:45:56.160 --> 2:46:01.920]  and evil and turned away from god they were brought into captivity because their people
[2:46:01.920 --> 2:46:07.840]  sold out to special interest and were infiltrated by spies and then they were enslaved we are
[2:46:07.840 --> 2:46:14.720]  repeating that again today compliance and going along with this system leads to absolute bondage
[2:46:15.520 --> 2:46:20.800]  info wars has decided to fight for freedom info wars has had great victory thanks to your support
[2:46:20.800 --> 2:46:29.760]  and your prayers info wars has become a symbol an emblem of not just american freedom but worldwide
[2:46:29.760 --> 2:46:35.920]  maverick spirit it's not just myself or the host at info wars or the researchers or the journalist
[2:46:35.920 --> 2:46:41.760]  it's you the listeners the activists the people on the front lines in the arena and it's the amazing
[2:46:41.760 --> 2:46:47.520]  guests and individuals that we interview that make info wars so special because we're not putting a
[2:46:47.520 --> 2:46:53.440]  filter in front of free minds we're having an open discussion about the real state of the world
[2:46:53.440 --> 2:46:57.600]  not the establishment of talking points that are put out by the council in fine relations
[2:46:57.600 --> 2:47:04.000]  the boulderberg group davos group and other clubs we're pushing for a pro human future where we
[2:47:04.000 --> 2:47:11.360]  build a planet and beyond based on humans or humans by humans not a world where the establishment
[2:47:11.360 --> 2:47:15.920]  hate themselves project their hate onto us and decide we're gonna have a post human world
[2:47:15.920 --> 2:47:21.040]  i'm really excited to know that info wars has your support i want to thank you all for being
[2:47:21.040 --> 2:47:48.320]  pro human and pro god you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:47:48.320 --> 2:47:52.880]  all right i like mexico's here but it always turns into a trainer i go somewhere wild
[2:47:52.880 --> 2:47:57.840]  last craziness paul joseph wants to talk to take over we're talking to dj amy and bob
[2:47:59.200 --> 2:48:05.200]  let's go ahead and talk to uh dj in new york friends is a hospital administrator
[2:48:05.200 --> 2:48:08.320]  got a lot of medical workers calling earlier but what's your view on covet 19 go ahead
[2:48:09.840 --> 2:48:16.160]  well whatever you want to call it or whatever you want to say it is i had it i caught it on a
[2:48:16.160 --> 2:48:23.440]  subway car in february when most people didn't realize how fast it was coming here and i got in
[2:48:23.440 --> 2:48:28.640]  the car and i smelled the dead bacteria in the air and the door closed behind me and i knew i
[2:48:28.640 --> 2:48:33.440]  was stuck and i knew by the next week i'd be feeling something that i did and let me tell you
[2:48:33.440 --> 2:48:40.800]  something that thing filled up my lungs just about to the top i had to sleep upright for two weeks
[2:48:40.800 --> 2:48:48.160]  and um truthfully if i didn't have my uh silver bullet with me i think i would have been in more
[2:48:48.160 --> 2:48:56.640]  trouble i took silver bullet every day and i took uh some powdered vitamin c and a drug called naproxen
[2:48:56.640 --> 2:49:02.800]  an anti-inflammatory drug that i have that it took down the swelling and my body was naturally
[2:49:02.800 --> 2:49:07.520]  able to drain off the water but um i lost i was about to say they don't want people to know that
[2:49:07.520 --> 2:49:13.280]  it's anti-inflammatories that have been beaten it yeah yeah definitely made all the difference in
[2:49:13.280 --> 2:49:17.360]  the world so you went through this how evil is it that they know all this and don't tell people
[2:49:18.560 --> 2:49:25.120]  well it's even more evil than that from what i know from a friend who is a uh he works in a
[2:49:25.120 --> 2:49:30.080]  hospital he's an administrator at one of the top respiratory hospitals in east coast we just put it
[2:49:30.080 --> 2:49:35.920]  that way and the stuff that he told me that's been going on and he's an electronic specialist
[2:49:35.920 --> 2:49:41.840]  don't think for a minute that 5g doesn't have something to do with the kill rate in all these
[2:49:41.840 --> 2:49:46.320]  areas where it's more developed okay because it definitely does i want to say something
[2:49:46.320 --> 2:49:50.480]  before you got to move on to paul i want to get a lot of intel out in a few seconds here a few
[2:49:50.480 --> 2:49:59.200]  minutes um first of all all of the respirator the uh what do you call them the uh ventilators
[2:49:59.200 --> 2:50:06.800]  they're all operated by wi-fi and they all have that chinese chip that can be remotely controlled
[2:50:06.800 --> 2:50:13.120]  well my friend came into the hospital one morning and the nurses were all upset somebody had died
[2:50:13.120 --> 2:50:19.440]  maybe more than one person and the ventilators went a little kilter overnight and they started
[2:50:19.440 --> 2:50:23.600]  going up higher than they were supposed to so this this is something that people need to know
[2:50:23.600 --> 2:50:28.960]  about aside from all the other horror stories that people are coming forward about and you
[2:50:28.960 --> 2:50:36.320]  know it the 5g is is a whole lot of stuff we know that and the medical field and this disaster
[2:50:36.320 --> 2:50:42.400]  that's going on it's just one of them and just a side note as far as max i love max kaiser i didn't
[2:50:42.400 --> 2:50:48.640]  mind waiting a while to listen to him but all that stuff that he's talking about which he wouldn't
[2:50:48.640 --> 2:50:54.960]  get into is it's all controlled by blockchain which is going to be working with the 5g and the
[2:50:54.960 --> 2:51:01.360]  internet of things when do you know when to get out of that that's the issue because you're not
[2:51:01.360 --> 2:51:06.560]  going to be able to get your money once they make all kinds of mark of the beast requirements
[2:51:06.560 --> 2:51:11.280]  you'll be stuck if you didn't get your money out so there's a problem go to anthony patch and look
[2:51:11.280 --> 2:51:17.760]  what he has to say about blockchain the christian now uh truth her okay so alex i came to the lord
[2:51:17.760 --> 2:51:23.360]  in the eighties i felt like i was in the wilderness until you came on the scene you were a breath of

[2:53:28.560 --> 2:53:42.800]  all in this together live from london england it's paul joseph watson with summit dot news
[2:53:46.160 --> 2:53:54.080]  well i've been waiting expectantly for our two minutes of hate there was supposed to be a nationwide
[2:53:54.080 --> 2:54:01.600]  bouffa boris event at 8 p.m. tonight in the united kingdom it's now six minutes past 8 p.m.
[2:54:02.560 --> 2:54:08.800]  was looking out the window didn't hear repeat so the nationwide bouffa boris the orwellian
[2:54:08.800 --> 2:54:13.920]  two minutes of hate directed against our prime minister for what reason i'll get into here in a
[2:54:13.920 --> 2:54:20.000]  second did not come off it wasn't even trending on twitter at the time and as you can see from that
[2:54:20.000 --> 2:54:25.840]  tweet it fell flat on its ass as we say here in the united kingdom unlike the clap for the nhs event
[2:54:25.840 --> 2:54:31.920]  which has achieved such religiosity and cult light status that it happens vehemently every
[2:54:31.920 --> 2:54:39.280]  thursday at 8 p.m. without fail but now even the founder of that applaud the nhs applaud the health
[2:54:39.280 --> 2:54:46.000]  workers movement is saying that it's become too politicized too cringe i would say and now that
[2:54:46.000 --> 2:54:53.200]  is set to end with the last mass communist style applause for government health care this thursday
[2:54:53.200 --> 2:54:59.600]  at 8 p.m. i'm sure some people will be taking part in that but from what i heard in an area
[2:54:59.600 --> 2:55:04.800]  which is controlled by a labor council so you expect there to be a lot of labor voters here
[2:55:04.800 --> 2:55:12.320]  taking part in bouffa boris didn't hear a single one what a failure what's it all about well there's
[2:55:12.320 --> 2:55:18.800]  a headline here out of sputnik and this has been going on for nearly a week people aren't angry about
[2:55:18.800 --> 2:55:23.920]  the fact that we've got thousands of boat migrants just showing up on the south coast of england
[2:55:23.920 --> 2:55:29.280]  being given a taxi service by our government being handed over by the french navy to the
[2:55:29.280 --> 2:55:35.040]  british navy to invade our country then let out into the general population i'm sure once they're
[2:55:35.040 --> 2:55:41.840]  totally legitimate asylum claims are processed of course some of those migrants were threatening
[2:55:41.840 --> 2:55:47.760]  to kill their own children if they weren't letting to the country for these people only want the best
[2:55:47.760 --> 2:55:51.520]  life for their children that's why they're trying to get here they don't care care about that they
[2:55:51.520 --> 2:55:56.960]  don't care about the fact that the lockdown which was imposed by boris johnson and you think that
[2:55:56.960 --> 2:56:04.080]  the lefties the labor voters would oppose him on this the lockdown itself no they want the lockdown
[2:56:04.080 --> 2:56:09.760]  to go on forever they want it to be more strict you would think that that would be a good standpoint
[2:56:09.760 --> 2:56:15.920]  for them to express their opposition to boris johnson of course leader of the conservative party
[2:56:16.480 --> 2:56:24.080]  but no they're angry about something else there's a headline out of sputnik shame on you protesters
[2:56:24.080 --> 2:56:30.720]  meet dominic comings with chants in front of his home in london and for the past four or five days
[2:56:31.840 --> 2:56:36.960]  vicious hateful left-wing protesters have been outside dominic comings home in london
[2:56:36.960 --> 2:56:45.040]  dominic comings is a senior advisor and a two prime minister boris johnson here in the uk
[2:56:45.600 --> 2:56:52.480]  just by coincidence he was also basically the mastermind of the brexit campaign the vote
[2:56:52.480 --> 2:56:57.280]  leave campaign so do they hate him for what he did or do they hate him for the fight that he was
[2:56:57.280 --> 2:57:03.760]  instrumental in taking the united kingdom out of the european union well what did he do well
[2:57:03.760 --> 2:57:11.280]  back in march when dominic comings and his wife both got ill at roughly the same time his wife had
[2:57:11.280 --> 2:57:18.400]  potential coronavirus symptoms dominic comings had all the classic symptoms of coronavirus and
[2:57:18.400 --> 2:57:24.320]  he's somebody who you would expect to be at risk from getting it because of course he works within
[2:57:24.320 --> 2:57:32.720]  government boris johnson himself got it so they both fell ill he was concerned about needing urgent
[2:57:32.720 --> 2:57:40.160]  childcare to look after his four-year-old son in case he his wife or both of them were in hospital
[2:57:40.160 --> 2:57:49.680]  and ill with coronavirus so they claim he broke the lockdown law to travel 500 miles north to
[2:57:49.680 --> 2:57:56.640]  durham in the north of england to visit his parents turned out he wasn't visiting his parents he was
[2:57:56.640 --> 2:58:03.280]  er urgently arranging childcare for his four-year-old son to hand him over to his parents while he
[2:58:03.280 --> 2:58:10.320]  isolated in a cottage a separate building that was on the property of his parents up north in
[2:58:10.320 --> 2:58:16.880]  durham again sounds like a dastardly cardinal sin doesn't it for the past five years five days
[2:58:17.840 --> 2:58:25.440]  five days in the uk the media has been baying for his blood demanding his resignation hateful
[2:58:25.440 --> 2:58:30.320]  left-wing protesters have been outside his front door the past four days on by the way
[2:58:31.280 --> 2:58:37.920]  these social distancing regulations that the media is apparently so concerned about don't seem to
[2:58:37.920 --> 2:58:46.000]  apply to the media itself michael heaver tweeted earlier today and it's on my timeline i retweeted
[2:58:46.000 --> 2:58:51.920]  it after answering questions at a lengthy press conference media still ignoring social distancing
[2:58:51.920 --> 2:58:58.320]  rules with police now required outside coming's house disgusting so the same social distancing
[2:58:58.320 --> 2:59:05.280]  rules that the entire country supposedly irate at dominant comings for disobeying are not being
[2:59:05.280 --> 2:59:11.120]  obeyed by the throngs of journalists who are packed tightly together none of them obeying social
[2:59:11.120 --> 2:59:17.920]  distancing rules as they clamor outside his house harassing him along with the left-wing protesters
[2:59:17.920 --> 2:59:25.520]  and for the past two days here in the uk on twitter media scum or hashtag scum media has
[2:59:25.520 --> 2:59:34.320]  been trending because again these people have completely jettisoned any pretense of impartiality
[2:59:34.320 --> 2:59:39.840]  and they've been again weaponized as political tools to try and get dominant comings fired
[2:59:39.840 --> 2:59:46.240]  because he was the mastermind of brexit this is all about brexit make no mistake about it
[2:59:46.240 --> 2:59:53.920]  it's not about a car journey two months ago by the way the architects of the lockdown itself of
[2:59:53.920 --> 3:00:01.280]  course we covered this story a couple of weeks ago professor ferguson whose model the entire
[3:00:01.280 --> 3:00:06.640]  policy of the country was based on not just the uk other countries as well he said 500
[3:00:06.640 --> 3:00:12.720]  thousand people would die of coronavirus this is a guy whose every previous prediction whether it
[3:00:12.720 --> 3:00:18.720]  be on sa's foot and mouth disease or a number of others was spectacularly wrong we believed him
[3:00:18.720 --> 3:00:24.160]  we locked down the entire country now we're going to face the consequences of that this guy
[3:00:25.200 --> 3:00:31.360]  he didn't travel to a different part of england breaking the lockdown to find urgent care for
[3:00:31.360 --> 3:00:37.280]  his child he broke the lockdown to have sex with a married woman that was in the media for about
[3:00:37.280 --> 3:00:43.040]  24 hours the outrage in comparison to this outrage over dominick comings was minimal
[3:00:44.080 --> 3:00:52.960]  we had another politician ian blackford who traveled from west minster up to scotland
[3:00:52.960 --> 3:00:57.920]  to visit his family the exact same charge that they leveled against dominick comings even though
[3:00:57.920 --> 3:01:02.800]  it later turned out that's not what he was doing anyway he was giving his toddler over his parents
[3:01:02.800 --> 3:01:09.920]  so they could care for him this guy ian blackford did the same thing but worse and then two days
[3:01:09.920 --> 3:01:16.320]  later he's tweeting at dominick comings i'm afraid this sums it up one rule for them and another for
[3:01:16.320 --> 3:01:23.360]  the rest of us he did the exact same thing the media said nothing why because he's in the s&p
[3:01:23.360 --> 3:01:29.440]  which is the left-wing party in scotland they call it the nationalist party it's everything but
[3:01:29.440 --> 3:01:36.960]  it is far left so professor lockdown can break the lockdown law to shag a married woman having an
[3:01:36.960 --> 3:01:44.640]  affair this mp from scotland can break the lockdown to visit his parents but they're both left wingers
[3:01:44.640 --> 3:01:49.520]  so it doesn't matter somebody on the right does it the media's camped out his house for a week
[3:01:49.520 --> 3:01:56.080]  he's getting shouted at by his own neighbors they're driving vans past with giant tv screens playing
[3:01:56.080 --> 3:02:01.840]  uh the family members of crying coronavirus victims but they don't care about any of that
[3:02:01.840 --> 3:02:09.200]  they only care about brexit and in fact it's now come out that while uh dominick comings was ill
[3:02:09.200 --> 3:02:15.280]  while he was almost certainly about to maybe have to go into hospital there came up an attempt to
[3:02:15.280 --> 3:02:22.160]  delay brexit even further and he was the one who shot it down so thank god that that happened
[3:02:22.160 --> 3:02:28.320]  that's the real reason that they were angry about it uh mark antero on twitter tweets about this
[3:02:28.320 --> 3:02:31.840]  the you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:02:39.360 --> 3:02:43.520]  you're listening to the summit dot news radio hour with pol
[3:02:43.520 --> 3:02:54.640]  tiff watson
[3:03:00.960 --> 3:03:07.040]  he broke the law to go and shag a married woman in london that's there's no there's no proviso
[3:03:07.040 --> 3:03:13.040]  there's no exemption for having sex with a married woman in the lockdown law that i've seen
[3:03:13.040 --> 3:03:17.280]  now what there is an exemption for is this the lockdown law in this country says quote
[3:03:18.640 --> 3:03:23.680]  if you have children keep following this advice to the best of your ability however
[3:03:23.680 --> 3:03:28.240]  we are aware that not all these measures will be possible and in the case of dominick comings
[3:03:28.240 --> 3:03:33.360]  that was not possible that's why he had to drive to the north of the country where his parents lived
[3:03:33.360 --> 3:03:37.760]  to hand over his child so they could care for him because there was a very real possibility
[3:03:37.760 --> 3:03:43.600]  that either he his wife or both of them would have ended up in hospital that's why he did it
[3:03:43.600 --> 3:03:49.360]  he had a big press conference yesterday explaining this but they still want blood and the reason why
[3:03:49.360 --> 3:03:56.000]  media scum is still trending today along with scum media on twitter at least the the uk twitter
[3:03:56.800 --> 3:04:03.200]  is because this harassment campaign has been led by the media to the point where they're now going
[3:04:03.200 --> 3:04:10.000]  up to the residence of his parents even though he's not there anymore ringing the bell on his
[3:04:10.000 --> 3:04:15.040]  elderly parents home to try and get them to come out and to try and harass them this is another
[3:04:15.040 --> 3:04:23.360]  example of media generated hysteria and harassment and it shows no signs of ending now why is he
[3:04:23.360 --> 3:04:29.680]  why is he under the spotlight it has nothing to do with cobit 19 they see the sky news journalist
[3:04:29.680 --> 3:04:36.320]  trying to harass his elderly parents at the home in Durham even though Cummings himself dominant
[3:04:36.320 --> 3:04:44.480]  company Cummings is not even there anymore David tweets civil service coup to keep us in the EU
[3:04:44.480 --> 3:04:51.520]  when Boris was hospitalized so Mark said will try to extend the transition period Cummings stopped him
[3:04:51.520 --> 3:04:56.800]  there's also an article here out of Breitbart garage remainers want Cummings out as an excuse
[3:04:56.800 --> 3:05:03.440]  to delay brexit because all along the line Cummings has steadfastly held his position when it comes
[3:05:03.440 --> 3:05:10.400]  to refusing to extend that deadline when it comes to brexit of course we had that big event back on
[3:05:10.400 --> 3:05:16.720]  january 31st while we left the EU or at least entered into the stages of pulling out of the EU
[3:05:16.720 --> 3:05:22.400]  the transition period as it were they want to extend the transition period because they still
[3:05:22.400 --> 3:05:28.960]  think they can cancel it after four years they still think they can cancel it just as you in
[3:05:28.960 --> 3:05:33.920]  the united states have had a four-year war on democracy with people trying to unseat Donald
[3:05:33.920 --> 3:05:37.840]  Trump they've been trying to reverse the democratic will of the british people when it comes to
[3:05:37.840 --> 3:05:44.480]  brexit for the past four years brexit party leader Nigel Farage has said that remainers want the
[3:05:44.480 --> 3:05:49.760]  prime minister's advisor Dominic Cummings fired in order to have an excuse to extend the transition
[3:05:49.760 --> 3:05:55.120]  period he said it is clear that there are many not all but many in the remain camp particularly
[3:05:55.120 --> 3:05:59.120]  who would like to see the back of him who think Cummings going now may well aid them
[3:05:59.120 --> 3:06:04.240]  in getting us to extend beyond the end of this year now you look at the polls
[3:06:05.280 --> 3:06:10.720]  RT reports Boris Johnson's approval rating plummets by 20 points after refusing to sack Cummings
[3:06:10.720 --> 3:06:17.840]  for lockdown breaches again it's all political and then you can contrast it with this story
[3:06:17.840 --> 3:06:23.600]  up on summit news now bear in mind i was just talking about Cummings's neighbors where he lives
[3:06:23.600 --> 3:06:30.320]  in north london protesters who turned up outside his house where his wife and kids are with placards
[3:06:30.880 --> 3:06:38.400]  viciously hatefully screaming at him every single day then we contrast it with this headline
[3:06:38.400 --> 3:06:44.240]  leftist guardian writer tweets desire to physically attack conservative mp in front of his children
[3:06:44.240 --> 3:06:49.040]  a leftist podcaster who writes for the guardian which is because of the big left-wing newspaper
[3:06:49.040 --> 3:06:54.240]  in brian has tweeted his desire to physically attack a conservative mp in front of his children
[3:06:54.880 --> 3:07:00.320]  yes it's not enough to violently assault somebody their kids have to be watching these are the
[3:07:00.320 --> 3:07:05.360]  tolerant tolerant people these are the nice people hashtag be kind these are the people
[3:07:05.360 --> 3:07:12.400]  who whine all day about bullying harassment and hate when they prove time and time again
[3:07:12.400 --> 3:07:19.360]  to be the most hateful people on the planet andy dorsen who writes for major left-wing newspapers
[3:07:19.360 --> 3:07:26.080]  the guardian and the mirror was responding to a tweet by sarah vine wife of michael gove mp
[3:07:26.720 --> 3:07:32.720]  so michael gove mp again a conservative party mp goes on the media this morning to defend
[3:07:32.720 --> 3:07:39.200]  dominant Cummings his wife tweets this in regard to the protests against Cummings outside his house
[3:07:39.200 --> 3:07:44.160]  as someone who has been followed and insulted in the street in front of my own children i would say
[3:07:44.160 --> 3:07:50.400]  that this is a classic example of what happens when a twitter mob spills into real life terrifying
[3:07:50.400 --> 3:07:56.400]  and disproportionate because of course the twitter cancellation mob outrage brigades don't just
[3:07:56.400 --> 3:08:03.840]  exist online they now exist in real life we saw another example in fact multiple with uh
[3:08:03.840 --> 3:08:10.880]  uh reese mog another conservative mp who again was confronted by these snarling leftist hate mobs
[3:08:10.880 --> 3:08:16.720]  outside his house in front of his children to the point where they were cussing at reese mog
[3:08:16.720 --> 3:08:22.160]  and his children insulting their father as they almost cried in front of the media the media
[3:08:22.160 --> 3:08:28.480]  had nothing much to say about that so he responded to the wife of michael gove mp who is defending
[3:08:28.480 --> 3:08:35.280]  Cummings and this is what he said he's deleting his account now by the way because he couldn't face
[3:08:35.280 --> 3:08:43.280]  the backlash he said quote hey you i see your c word of a husband is lying through his effing
[3:08:43.280 --> 3:08:49.600]  teeth all over the tv this morning i'd pay hard cash to chase the effer down the street
[3:08:49.600 --> 3:08:55.200]  and boot him in the balls and definitely in front of your kids because they need to know
[3:08:55.200 --> 3:09:04.800]  what a rank s house their dad is again so much for the tolerant left so this guy who is a big
[3:09:04.800 --> 3:09:11.280]  leftist was responding to the wife of a conservative mp by saying i want to beat you up in the street
[3:09:11.280 --> 3:09:17.440]  and i want your kids to watch it send tweet you thought that was a good idea dorsen locked down
[3:09:17.440 --> 3:09:22.720]  his twitter account soon after he started receiving backlash for the tweet uh christ
[3:09:22.720 --> 3:09:27.680]  tomlinson of brightwater tweeted verified leftist andy dorsen a writer for the guardian
[3:09:27.680 --> 3:09:32.480]  the daily mirror not only advocates for political violence i.e terrorism against a sitting cabinet
[3:09:32.480 --> 3:09:39.520]  minister he's willing to finance it as well exactly what democracy is left in the uk as i
[3:09:39.520 --> 3:09:45.440]  write in the article also highlights the two-tier system operated by social media giants like twitter
[3:09:45.440 --> 3:09:50.800]  which routinely bans conservatives to their opinions let allows yet allows clear threats
[3:09:50.800 --> 3:09:58.000]  of violence even against elected members of parliament to go unpunished as i spoke about
[3:09:58.000 --> 3:10:04.880]  a couple of weeks ago on the show after rand paul went up against dr falchi in what was not even
[3:10:04.880 --> 3:10:10.880]  really a cantankerous confrontation it was merely rand paul asking him a question and
[3:10:10.880 --> 3:10:17.920]  questioning why he should be the supreme authority on corona virus on twitter within an hour there
[3:10:17.920 --> 3:10:21.760]  were people saying i'm hashtag rand paul's neighbor they were talking about rand paul's
[3:10:21.760 --> 3:10:28.560]  neighbor celebrating rand paul's neighbor rand paul's neighbor violently attacked rand paul
[3:10:28.560 --> 3:10:35.760]  from behind leaving him having to have part of his lung removed at one stage he was very very
[3:10:35.760 --> 3:10:42.080]  seriously ill in hospital they got on twitter they celebrated it from what i saw nobody was
[3:10:42.080 --> 3:10:48.720]  banned for that within three hours of this leftist expressing his will to violently attack an
[3:10:48.720 --> 3:10:54.080]  elected member of parliament in front of his children nothing whatsoever had happened to his
[3:10:54.080 --> 3:11:01.200]  verified twitter account and he later deleted it himself so that's what we're dealing with hateful
[3:11:01.200 --> 3:11:09.760]  mob outrage leftists whipped up ginned up by the hysterical be among you're listening to the alex
[3:11:09.760 --> 3:11:25.040]  jones show transmitting worldwide from the summit dot news studios in the united kingdom you are
[3:11:25.040 --> 3:11:34.480]  listening to paul joseph watson now we're going to talk about a video which was uploaded to twitter
[3:11:34.480 --> 3:11:42.240]  yesterday and has received 30 million views in 24 hours on twitter and is now being exploited to
[3:11:42.240 --> 3:11:49.040]  push yet more racial division in the united states i noticed that the hashtag black lives matter is
[3:11:49.040 --> 3:11:53.920]  trending once again that's partly in relation to this story and one other regarding police
[3:11:53.920 --> 3:11:58.480]  brutality we're gonna play this video here in a second but there's a headline out of sky news
[3:11:58.480 --> 3:12:05.600]  describing part of what happened because as we'll see the media doesn't have both sides of the story
[3:12:05.600 --> 3:12:12.240]  headline sky news woman sorry for calling police after black man asked her to put dog on leash
[3:12:12.800 --> 3:12:17.680]  the woman in the video has denied being racist and says she humbly and fully apologizes for our
[3:12:17.680 --> 3:12:23.520]  actions video of a white woman calling police after a row with a black man who asked her to
[3:12:23.520 --> 3:12:30.560]  put a dog on a leash has gone viral when this clip was uploaded yesterday to twitter the headline
[3:12:30.560 --> 3:12:37.120]  was this or the text accompanying the video posted by the sister of the african-american
[3:12:37.120 --> 3:12:43.200]  man involved in the confrontation in central park said this oh when carons take a walk with their
[3:12:43.200 --> 3:12:48.400]  dogs off leash in the famous bramble in new york central park where it's clearly posted on signs
[3:12:48.400 --> 3:12:55.360]  that dogs must be leash at all times and someone like my brother an avid birder politely asked her
[3:12:55.360 --> 3:13:01.920]  to put her dog on the leash now from what you will see in this video you will be in no doubt as to
[3:13:01.920 --> 3:13:08.000]  who is the uh villain of the piece and it's clearly the mask wearing Karen woman who not only appears
[3:13:08.000 --> 3:13:12.560]  to be racist towards the african-american man appears to basically try and get him swattered
[3:13:12.560 --> 3:13:19.200]  by the police but also almost succeeds in strangling her own dog and there's no doubt that she is indeed
[3:13:19.200 --> 3:13:25.360]  a villain but as i'll get onto in a second there are two villains involved in this script now let's
[3:13:25.360 --> 3:13:30.240]  go to the one minute video of this confrontation in central park new york here it is
[3:13:33.920 --> 3:13:39.440]  would you please stop sir i'm asking you to stop please don't come close to me sir i'm asking
[3:13:39.440 --> 3:13:42.880]  you to stop recording please don't come close to me please take your phone off please don't come
[3:13:42.880 --> 3:13:47.360]  close to me and i'm taking pictures holding the cops please please call the cops please call the
[3:13:47.360 --> 3:13:51.920]  cops i'm gonna tell them there's an african-american man threatening my life please tell them whatever you
[3:13:51.920 --> 3:13:56.480]  like excuse me
[3:13:56.480 --> 3:14:10.640]  i'm sorry i'm in the ramble and there is a man african-american who is a vice
[3:14:10.640 --> 3:14:13.520]  chairman he is recording me and threatening me and my dog
[3:14:16.240 --> 3:14:20.320]  there is an african-american man i am in central park he is recording me
[3:14:20.320 --> 3:14:29.840]  he is threatening myself and my dog and my i'm sorry i can't hear you either i'm being threatened
[3:14:29.840 --> 3:14:36.800]  by a man in the ramble please send the cops immediately i'm in central park in the ramble
[3:14:36.800 --> 3:14:45.520]  i don't know thank you so as you can see from that clip and if you were just listening to that
[3:14:45.520 --> 3:14:50.880]  with the audio by the end of the clip she's basically almost strangling her dog to death
[3:14:50.880 --> 3:14:55.760]  she's since been put on administrative leave from her financial job and her dog has indeed
[3:14:55.760 --> 3:15:02.640]  been taken and of course if you base your judgment on only what's in that clip you will think that
[3:15:02.640 --> 3:15:09.200]  there's only one villain of the piece that she's calling the cops immediately on a whim because
[3:15:09.200 --> 3:15:14.640]  she's quote being threatened even though there's no evidence in the video of her being threatened
[3:15:14.640 --> 3:15:19.520]  and of course the fact that she said it's an african-american man is immediately being taken
[3:15:19.520 --> 3:15:25.760]  as proof that she's racist and was trying to get the police involved so they could violently
[3:15:25.760 --> 3:15:30.400]  tackle the african-american man because of course for the past month or so we've had a
[3:15:30.400 --> 3:15:36.000]  resurgence of this narrative that afric african-american people are just being viciously attacked
[3:15:36.000 --> 3:15:40.960]  every time they step outside their house in fact i had this headline from 7th of may
[3:15:40.960 --> 3:15:47.280]  LeBron James claims black people are quote hunted every time we step outside our homes
[3:15:47.280 --> 3:15:53.200]  so that has been the narrative for the past month but if you only saw the video you could
[3:15:53.200 --> 3:15:58.560]  side with the person filming the video it was his sister who later posted it to twitter
[3:15:58.560 --> 3:16:04.480]  and indeed media reporting does exactly that continuing with the sky news article says a
[3:16:04.480 --> 3:16:07.760]  video of a white woman calling police after a row with a black man who asked her to put
[3:16:07.760 --> 3:16:12.720]  a dog on a leash has gone viral christian cooper said he was bird watching in a woodland area of
[3:16:12.720 --> 3:16:17.920]  new york central park when the argument began mr cooper performed marvel comics editor filmed part
[3:16:17.920 --> 3:16:23.600]  of the altercation with the woman it's now who is now in suspended from her job she tells him to stop
[3:16:23.600 --> 3:16:30.240]  recording so the entire premise of the narrative is that the woman is lying by claiming the man
[3:16:30.240 --> 3:16:37.440]  threatened her when all he did was asked her to put her dog on a leash so the narrative is this
[3:16:37.440 --> 3:16:43.280]  mask wearing Karen has gone completely over the top she's racist she's putting the man's life at risk
[3:16:44.000 --> 3:16:49.440]  describing him as african-american presumably to make him sound more scary to the police because
[3:16:49.440 --> 3:16:58.320]  she's this horrible racist 30 million views on twitter with that narrative turns out the guy in
[3:16:58.320 --> 3:17:04.880]  the clip was threatening her but you don't get to see that part of the interaction and my source
[3:17:04.880 --> 3:17:11.760]  for that is the guy himself because he posted this to facebook immediately after the incident
[3:17:11.760 --> 3:17:18.880]  and this was tweeted by jack presobic just a couple of hours ago this is from the guy
[3:17:18.880 --> 3:17:24.320]  filming the video involved in the confrontation with the woman who again has cut off the part
[3:17:24.320 --> 3:17:29.360]  of it to make her look like a liar in claiming that he was threatening her when he wasn't but
[3:17:29.360 --> 3:17:36.800]  this is what he said on facebook christian cooper central park this morning this woman's dog is
[3:17:36.800 --> 3:17:42.560]  tearing through the plantings in the ramble me ma'am dogs in the ramble have to be on the leash
[3:17:42.560 --> 3:17:48.320]  at all times the sign is right there her the dog runs are closed he needs his exercise me
[3:17:49.120 --> 3:17:53.040]  all you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive outside the ramble and you can let
[3:17:53.040 --> 3:17:58.800]  him run off leash all you want her it's too dangerous me look if you're going to do what
[3:17:58.800 --> 3:18:09.120]  you want i'm going to do what i want but you're not going to like it her what's that me to the dog
[3:18:09.120 --> 3:18:16.720]  come here puppy her he won't come to you me we'll see about that i pull out the dog treats i carry
[3:18:16.720 --> 3:18:21.600]  for just such in transigence i didn't get even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before
[3:18:21.600 --> 3:18:28.640]  Karen scramble to grab the dog her don't you touch my dog that's when i started recording the video
[3:18:28.640 --> 3:18:36.400]  so again before the recording began this guy said to the woman if you're going to do going to do
[3:18:36.400 --> 3:18:42.560]  what you want i'm going to do what i want but you're not going to like it and then he calls over
[3:18:42.560 --> 3:18:50.800]  the dog now to any reasonable person that is an implicit threat of harm to the woman's dog
[3:18:50.800 --> 3:18:55.600]  whether he was actually going to do anything to the dog nobody knows but that is a threat
[3:18:55.600 --> 3:18:59.840]  towards the woman's dog if somebody came up to your dog and started threatening to do something to it
[3:19:00.640 --> 3:19:07.360]  you probably wouldn't have the best reaction either so both individuals in this clip are Karen's
[3:19:08.080 --> 3:19:14.400]  this mask wearing woman who's freaking out strangling her own dog calling the police on the guy trying
[3:19:14.400 --> 3:19:21.120]  to escalate the confrontation immediately she's bad and so is the guy for leaving out the recording
[3:19:21.120 --> 3:19:28.240]  or misrepresenting what happened by leaving out the recording before he uploaded it to twitter
[3:19:28.240 --> 3:19:34.240]  he should have described what happened in the text of the video on twitter but he didn't
[3:19:34.240 --> 3:19:40.800]  and that completely changed the narrative of the story of course people have pointed out in the
[3:19:40.800 --> 3:19:47.920]  aftermath last week we had an african-american male viciously beating an elderly white man
[3:19:47.920 --> 3:19:54.960]  and viciously beating an elderly woman in a care home in Detroit and it got basically two percent
[3:19:54.960 --> 3:20:01.200]  of the media coverage that this story out of new york is getting today despite the fact that
[3:20:01.200 --> 3:20:07.440]  if you watched the video we highlighted it on the show last week of the african-american male
[3:20:07.440 --> 3:20:13.520]  beating the elderly white people it was even more disturbing than that confrontation in central park
[3:20:13.520 --> 3:20:20.320]  that didn't get 30 million views the central park video did that didn't get two percent of the media
[3:20:20.320 --> 3:20:26.240]  coverage that the central park incident is getting today trending all over twitter even
[3:20:26.240 --> 3:20:32.880]  though it's been completely misrepresented so yet another media hoax ginned up by hysteria
[3:20:33.520 --> 3:20:40.240]  as an exploitative move to again cause race divisions in the united states in the aftermath
[3:20:40.240 --> 3:20:47.600]  of of course the killing of mr jogger on mode old break just a few weeks ago at least when
[3:20:47.600 --> 3:20:52.560]  that story came to life a few weeks ago so they completely lied about what happened in the story
[3:20:52.560 --> 3:20:58.240]  both individuals in this video are villains but that's not how the media is reporting it
[3:20:58.240 --> 3:21:09.760]  they're lying by a mission don't go away summit don't news will be back you're listening to the alex jones show

[3:22:50.720 --> 3:22:54.560]  turned out to be a tale of two Karen's but the media is not going to tell you that we had this
[3:22:54.560 --> 3:23:01.840]  story yesterday video woman driven out of grocery store by angry mob for not wearing a mask yes the
[3:23:01.840 --> 3:23:08.480]  high priest class of mask wearers strikes again video footage out of Staten Island shows a woman
[3:23:08.480 --> 3:23:12.960]  being driven out of a grocery store by an angry mob because she's not wearing a mask the clip shows
[3:23:12.960 --> 3:23:17.680]  the woman surrounded by the shoppers of the as they yell and cuss at her get the f out of here
[3:23:17.680 --> 3:23:22.560]  get out the crowd screams at the woman while pointing towards the exit and if you read the
[3:23:22.560 --> 3:23:31.520]  comments below this video on twitter most of them supported the angry mob so once again this
[3:23:31.520 --> 3:23:36.880]  mask which at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic they said don't wear a mask because it
[3:23:36.880 --> 3:23:43.760]  doesn't do anything and you're depriving doctors and nurses of PPE so people who wear masks are bad
[3:23:43.760 --> 3:23:49.440]  they're evil now they're saying if you don't wear a mask that means you're evil because you're not a
[3:23:49.440 --> 3:23:56.400]  good little obedient slave so now they're literally hounding people out of grocery stores in new york
[3:23:56.400 --> 3:24:02.720]  or having formed into giant mobs maybe they should ask to be paid for it because that's what's about
[3:24:02.720 --> 3:24:08.800]  to happen in italy headline italian government wants an employee to become social distancing
[3:24:08.800 --> 3:24:13.760]  snitches the italian government announced intention sunday to create an army of social
[3:24:13.760 --> 3:24:20.320]  distancing snitches saying it will recruit 60 000 carons to monitor their friends and
[3:24:20.320 --> 3:24:25.600]  neighbors activities make sure they are adhering to social distancing policies reports indicate
[3:24:25.600 --> 3:24:29.280]  the government will reach out especially to the unemployed for the roles in particular those who
[3:24:29.280 --> 3:24:35.920]  have applied for benefits recently so again just as in the united states mass unemployment caused
[3:24:35.920 --> 3:24:42.480]  by the lockdown then they fill in the gaps by creating tens of thousands of starzy like spies
[3:24:42.480 --> 3:24:47.760]  for the state who will snitch on you who will grass you up if you don't properly engage in
[3:24:47.760 --> 3:24:53.600]  social distancing which of course you look at many of the studies proves that the lockdown
[3:24:53.600 --> 3:24:58.720]  that social distancing didn't really have an effect on coronavirus death but that doesn't
[3:24:58.720 --> 3:25:04.880]  matter because this is very lucrative for big brother it wants people to become civic assistants
[3:25:04.880 --> 3:25:09.760]  who will report infractions on the use of face masks and other state-ordered rules in the wake
[3:25:09.760 --> 3:25:14.400]  of the coronavirus lockdown the informants will not be given uniforms or badges and will simply
[3:25:14.400 --> 3:25:20.720]  be embedded within the population meaning anyone could be a government snitch just like in east
[3:25:20.720 --> 3:25:27.440]  germany it could be your friend it could be your neighbor meanwhile ikea to employ social distancing
[3:25:27.440 --> 3:25:34.960]  wardens to patrol shoppers this is in the uk ikea is set to employ social distance wardens
[3:25:34.960 --> 3:25:39.680]  who tell people how to behave in stores as a whole new jobs market for carons is created
[3:25:39.680 --> 3:25:44.160]  swedish furniture giant i announced today that it would open 19 of its stores across the uk on
[3:25:44.160 --> 3:25:50.400]  june 1st however family is hoping to make a day of visiting the store can forget about it only
[3:25:50.400 --> 3:25:56.960]  one adult and one child per household is allowed so again they're exploiting these stupid social
[3:25:56.960 --> 3:26:02.160]  distancing rules to ensure families can't have days out then it says other measures to ensure
[3:26:02.160 --> 3:26:07.440]  safer trading during the coronavirus outbreak include social distance wardens to help shoppers
[3:26:07.440 --> 3:26:15.440]  navigate a new one-way system so again get ready for ethnic minority minimum wage slaves imported
[3:26:15.440 --> 3:26:24.800]  as cheap labor to bark orders at you and your family as you shop can't wait meanwhile psychiatrists
[3:26:24.800 --> 3:26:30.480]  row 86 percent more prescriptions for psychotropic drugs during lockdown months again this gets to
[3:26:30.480 --> 3:26:36.480]  the heart of this massive mental health problem that we won't feel the full effects for for years
[3:26:36.480 --> 3:26:41.600]  to come psychiatrists row 86 percent more prescriptions for psychotropic drugs including
[3:26:41.600 --> 3:26:47.440]  antidepressants during the lockdown months of march and april compared to january and february
[3:26:48.400 --> 3:26:54.640]  prescriptions for anti-exotic medications and sleep aids have risen during the pandemic reports
[3:26:54.640 --> 3:27:00.800]  the wall street journal so big hike in prescriptions of antidepressants which of course
[3:27:00.800 --> 3:27:05.520]  have a number of side effects which aren't necessarily great but again it illustrates how
[3:27:05.520 --> 3:27:11.280]  this has been terrible for people's mental health and on that very subject california hospital
[3:27:11.280 --> 3:27:18.480]  records more suicides than coronavirus deaths during lockdown this is uh john muir medical
[3:27:18.480 --> 3:27:23.760]  center in walnut creek california doctors say they've recorded more deaths from suicide than
[3:27:23.760 --> 3:27:28.720]  coronavirus with a year's worth of suicides and suicide attempts being recorded in a four-week
[3:27:28.720 --> 3:27:35.120]  period all the nurses and doctors at this hospital trying to blow the whistle calling for the lockdown
[3:27:35.120 --> 3:27:43.120]  to be fully lifted because more people have died from suicide than coronavirus itself and related
[3:27:43.120 --> 3:27:48.960]  to that there's another headline here which i just put up on summit news a couple of hours ago
[3:27:48.960 --> 3:27:55.360]  study lockdown will destroy at least seven times more years of human life than it saves once again
[3:27:55.360 --> 3:28:01.360]  the lockdown claiming more lives than all the social distancing uh the coronavirus the social
[3:28:01.360 --> 3:28:08.000]  distancing causing more deaths than the coronavirus itself then what was the point the study has found
[3:28:08.000 --> 3:28:13.440]  that the stay at home lockdown order in the united states will quote destroy at least seven times
[3:28:13.440 --> 3:28:18.720]  more years of human life than it saves and that this number is likely to be more than 90 times
[3:28:18.720 --> 3:28:27.600]  greater why well because of debilitating stress anxiety job losses untreated illnesses remember
[3:28:27.600 --> 3:28:33.280]  i've talked about this many times the professor of cancer at king's college is predicting at least
[3:28:33.280 --> 3:28:41.680]  50 000 cancer deaths in the uk cancer deaths alone excess cancer deaths because people were unable
[3:28:41.680 --> 3:28:46.400]  to get treatment that's more deaths than people have died from coronavirus in the uk so far
[3:28:46.960 --> 3:28:54.640]  and that's not even including the 1.4 million global tuberculosis deaths that experts say
[3:28:54.640 --> 3:28:59.440]  are now going to happen again because people couldn't get treatment because the hospitals
[3:28:59.440 --> 3:29:05.120]  were all devoted to coronavirus we couldn't overwhelm the hospitals while all the nurses
[3:29:05.120 --> 3:29:13.600]  were dancing on tiktok because that's very important meanwhile in sweden we talked about
[3:29:13.600 --> 3:29:19.040]  this last week there's been a development father of swedish man killed by migrant forced by media
[3:29:19.040 --> 3:29:25.680]  to defend his dead son from nazi smears so we had the initial story which was a swedish man who
[3:29:25.680 --> 3:29:33.200]  was killed by a sudanese migrant while trying to prevent a woman being raped and now his father is
[3:29:33.200 --> 3:29:38.800]  being harassed by the media they're not asking questions about sweden has a why sweden has a
[3:29:38.800 --> 3:29:44.720]  massive problem with violent crime why sweden has a massive problem with rape now they're going to
[3:29:44.720 --> 3:29:51.360]  the house of the father of the victim who was murdered by the migrant to ask him was your son a
[3:29:51.360 --> 3:29:58.000]  nazi as we previously highlighted tommy lind was stabbed to death while trying to stop the assault
[3:29:58.000 --> 3:30:04.080]  after a group of migrants crashed a house party in hornos and uninvited after killing lind the
[3:30:04.080 --> 3:30:11.200]  migrant continued to rape the woman he was later named as 22-year-old abu veika muhammad a sudanese
[3:30:11.200 --> 3:30:16.160]  migrant who was granted swedish citizenship in 2011 and had a long criminal record including
[3:30:16.160 --> 3:30:23.120]  a 2015 conviction of raping a girl under the age of 15 why on earth was he out on the streets when
[3:30:23.120 --> 3:30:29.840]  he'd been convicted of raping a girl less than five years ago following the murder of right-wing
[3:30:29.840 --> 3:30:35.920]  groups staged a protest in hornos and of course the media was more outraged about that how dare they
[3:30:35.920 --> 3:30:42.080]  say against the killing but the demonstrators were immediately smeared as nazis by the media
[3:30:42.080 --> 3:30:49.040]  but that wasn't enough swedish public broadcaster svt which dutifully amplified the nazi narrative
[3:30:49.040 --> 3:30:55.520]  then paid a visit to the home of lind's father after he'd been stabbed to death by a migrant for
[3:30:55.520 --> 3:31:00.720]  trying to stop a woman being raped where his father was forced to defend his dead son against
[3:31:00.720 --> 3:31:06.080]  accusations he was racist the article makes clear the father was grilled about why his son had a
[3:31:06.080 --> 3:31:11.680]  shaved head as he insisted lind was not a nazi but may have had friends who sympathized with the
[3:31:11.680 --> 3:31:17.600]  nordic resistance movement the group that staged the protest so they were more interested in the
[3:31:17.600 --> 3:31:22.240]  victim's political leanings than reported than reporting on the fact that he was killed by a
[3:31:22.240 --> 3:31:29.200]  migrant while trying to stop a woman being raped is it any surprise that parties like the one lind
[3:31:29.200 --> 3:31:35.360]  the victim supported alternative for sweden and sweden democrats which is the other populist party
[3:31:35.360 --> 3:31:40.960]  are doing better and better in sweden which of course has been notorious become notorious
[3:31:40.960 --> 3:31:45.680]  which ramping problems with violent crime as a result of mass immigration it's going to wrap
[3:31:45.680 --> 3:32:01.600]  it up coming up warring with owenshryerinfowars.com don't go away
