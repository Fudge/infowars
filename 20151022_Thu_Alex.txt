[04:08.360 --> 04:17.080]  by anti-government views racism bigotry and anarchy and other despicable beliefs this
[04:17.080 --> 04:24.880]  is how democracy dies this is how ideas opinions and freedom are squashed in the noonday sun

[08:33.160 --> 08:40.600]  live thursday worldwide broadcast twenty second day of october twenty fifteen of course the
[08:40.600 --> 08:47.280]  Benghazi hearings with hillary clinton also known as hitlery are ongoing right now in
[08:47.280 --> 08:52.080]  a few minutes we're going to go to that live feed on c span for everyone we've got that
[08:52.080 --> 08:58.280]  patched in and ready as we do always at the ready with the connection to c span and other
[08:58.280 --> 09:02.960]  news channels we can flip right over and get cover the latest but really it is a bunch
[09:02.960 --> 09:08.680]  of political jousting we've seen the clinton's and others basically blackmailing congress
[09:08.680 --> 09:16.440]  for a long time Elijah Cummings comes out and says that this is political well of course
[09:16.440 --> 09:22.360]  it's political just like the irs one after more than ten thousand christian organizations
[09:22.360 --> 09:28.440]  veterans groups conservative groups libertarian groups and others second amendment groups
[09:28.440 --> 09:33.680]  you name it taking away their tax exemption auditing them in guiding people arresting
[09:33.680 --> 09:41.680]  people the difference was that was illegitimate everything's political in one way or another
[09:41.680 --> 09:46.600]  but it was illegitimate it was illegal it was targeting innocent people hillary was
[09:46.600 --> 09:53.720]  involved in the import export arm of the state department giving weapons and other restricted
[09:53.720 --> 09:59.160]  systems to countries that would give money to her foundation clinton has been involved
[09:59.160 --> 10:03.920]  in a long train of corruption clinton has been involved being caught with secret email
[10:03.920 --> 10:09.840]  accounts to stay outside the purview of the freedom of information act clinton has been
[10:09.840 --> 10:16.760]  caught on so many fronts that it makes really my head hurt to try to even call it all up
[10:16.760 --> 10:27.240]  into into my conscious focus cerebral cortex so yes it's political we have john carry in
[10:27.240 --> 10:34.920]  the news today joining a chorus of other totalitarian saying bar anyone from high office including
[10:34.920 --> 10:40.760]  elected office if you don't believe in global warming that's now climate change well no
[10:40.760 --> 10:46.720]  i believe in climate change i do not believe humans are the main driver of that all the
[10:46.720 --> 10:55.680]  scientific evidence shows the sun then the moon then separate space wins not associated
[10:55.680 --> 11:04.680]  with the sun of the moon space wins and that means the light the particles the micro debris
[11:04.680 --> 11:16.840]  the dark matter dimensional fluctuations the radioactive wavelengths there are hundreds
[11:16.840 --> 11:22.240]  and hundreds of measured phenomenon coming in out of space before they thought it was
[11:22.240 --> 11:28.560]  potash from fires that drove condensation and nuclei being formed in clouds now they
[11:28.560 --> 11:32.960]  know it's not that's a very small part of it in most of the big even nasa studies less
[11:32.960 --> 11:38.440]  than 10 percent yes big fires can't get into the atmosphere and cause then condensation
[11:38.440 --> 11:43.240]  that comes by to concentrate and then turn into rain volcanic activity has been shown
[11:43.240 --> 11:50.400]  to do that certainly that's involved but the main driver is massive amounts of space dust
[11:50.400 --> 11:58.560]  micro meteorites coming into the atmosphere exploding and then adding to the particular
[11:58.560 --> 12:04.120]  eye but i don't want to go off into a science lesson you can buy pieces of mars for only
[12:04.120 --> 12:10.020]  a few thousand dollars there are martian meteorites being found every couple days in different
[12:10.020 --> 12:15.840]  parts of the world especially antarctica and the arctic because they're right on the surface
[12:15.840 --> 12:22.280]  of the ice drift right on the top of the permafrost right on the top of the glaciers i just find
[12:22.280 --> 12:29.280]  that interesting folks should know that some of the folks that don't believe in creation
[12:29.280 --> 12:33.400]  ism which i don't believe in the official version of that that's another false construct
[12:33.400 --> 12:39.240]  in my research so is the main line darwinian evolution but a lot of science points towards
[12:39.240 --> 12:45.000]  life being seated here from martian meteorites and the question that nature magazine posed
[12:45.000 --> 12:52.360]  a few years ago are we martians i'm not saying that i'm digressing i don't get into god's
[12:52.360 --> 12:57.240]  long-term plan i know there is a god that created this planet and created us and made
[12:57.240 --> 13:02.480]  us in his image but when they sit there and say that humans are the main driver of climate
[13:02.480 --> 13:12.560]  it is asinine total bull but i'm already getting away from the big news obviously of the day
[13:12.560 --> 13:16.920]  and that is the Benghazi hearings that are ongoing right now i'm going to play some of
[13:16.920 --> 13:23.600]  these opening statements then we'll go to the live feed coming up and then last night
[13:23.600 --> 13:28.160]  i was downtown already meeting with some facebook folks uh people not people that work with
[13:28.160 --> 13:32.880]  facebook but folks that are successful on facebook uh dominating it reaching people
[13:32.880 --> 13:36.080]  because that's what i want to do is reach more people that are kind of tied into the
[13:36.080 --> 13:43.880]  matrix and anthony gerti already called me and he was downtown and i thought you know
[13:43.880 --> 13:50.080]  i'm downtown why don't we call josh owens it's like 4 30 he's a hard working camera
[13:50.080 --> 13:57.640]  guy and some of the other crew why don't we invite them down so we can just talk about
[13:57.640 --> 14:01.440]  google and shoot a report for tomorrow that's just what we do it's fun to shoot reports
[14:01.440 --> 14:08.080]  we shot two different reports antsy and i yesterday on different subjects and he said
[14:08.080 --> 14:13.160]  sure let's do it so josh came down uh with our newest hire mr zimmerman and they did
[14:13.160 --> 14:17.400]  a great job and we're standing in front of google and i go you know i've talked about
[14:17.400 --> 14:22.400]  how i ought to march into the new google headquarters in austin and with cameras and watch them
[14:22.400 --> 14:26.560]  freak out that we have cameras when they're watching us on our computer screens they're
[14:26.560 --> 14:31.720]  tracking us they're listening to us but they're literally watching us with the cameras and
[14:31.720 --> 14:35.840]  listening to us with the microphones i know i overused the word literally but that's not
[14:35.840 --> 14:39.400]  a figure of speech when i say they're watching meaning they're tracking your cookies and
[14:39.400 --> 14:45.520]  where you go and what you do they are physically watching you through the camera physically
[14:45.520 --> 14:51.480]  listening to you uh and this is all admitted you can just pull it up samsung admits it
[14:51.480 --> 14:54.760]  we first reported on it about 12 years ago people couldn't believe it but now it's it's
[14:54.760 --> 15:00.320]  mainstream news and i said watch this when we walk in here they're going to flip out
[15:00.320 --> 15:05.280]  they're going to call the police and sure enough they put their hands on me they grabbed
[15:05.280 --> 15:11.960]  on me they called police we waited about 10 minutes not seven minutes till the bike police
[15:11.960 --> 15:18.800]  showed up we walk over smiling they say just a moment mr jones and they said okay what
[15:18.800 --> 15:22.560]  happened well he walked in here with a camera and we don't want him in here and they said
[15:22.560 --> 15:27.120]  okay but you got the door open and you're saying it's open to the public do you have
[15:27.120 --> 15:33.080]  signs in there saying no filming as you said okay fine they're welcome to come in this is
[15:33.080 --> 15:37.360]  the head google lady that who was over the event being put on they had an event going
[15:37.360 --> 15:45.640]  on as you every afternoon basically seven days a week and the cops weren't siding with
[15:45.640 --> 15:53.240]  me they were actually siding with common law and so the cops told him you either got to
[15:53.240 --> 15:59.840]  shut these doors and not say it's open to the public or you've got a hang up sign saying
[15:59.840 --> 16:05.080]  no cameras or you can't keep him out and so she said okay fine mr. jones you can come
[16:05.080 --> 16:09.160]  in but we don't want the cameras on and i said no that's okay it's your private property
[16:09.160 --> 16:13.240]  now i just wanted to illustrate what was going on i'm not against you lady the cops said

[18:30.440 --> 18:36.680]  and show us funded by ut and the ford foundation and i'm just the gloves are off okay the gloves
[18:36.680 --> 18:41.400]  are off i'm going to be pulling hardcore stunts against the globalist and i want to encourage
[18:41.400 --> 18:47.760]  everybody else to do it and we've got investigative journalism going on behind the scenes as well
[18:47.760 --> 18:51.960]  we got a lot of stuff happening here at the info wars operation because the globalists
[18:51.960 --> 18:55.360]  are accelerating their program we're accelerating ours by the way darin Mcbrane put together
[18:55.360 --> 19:01.200]  an excellent very powerful compilation we'll get to after Benghazi coverage in the next
[19:01.200 --> 19:07.520]  segment dealing with just some of the latest calls for banning and restricting guns and
[19:07.520 --> 19:10.520]  then you can dovetail that with them denying they're coming for the guns because while
[19:10.520 --> 19:13.920]  we're talking about all these other issues and Benghazi and the rest of it and donald
[19:13.920 --> 19:19.320]  trump we're under the tpp we're under un treating on the guns they don't care if it didn't get
[19:19.320 --> 19:28.080]  ratified they're coming for us the bitter clingers they want to complete their old score
[19:28.080 --> 19:36.280]  with the american people to dominate us so we are going to be exposing this entire situation
[19:36.280 --> 19:40.480]  coming up and again on the issue of migrants i don't blame these poor people wanting to
[19:40.480 --> 19:44.920]  come here especially if they get a lot of freebies but i do blame companies like walmart
[19:44.920 --> 19:50.240]  and others that tell their employees we pay you less so you can you know qualify for welfare
[19:50.240 --> 19:54.280]  this is how the system is gaming everything and i'm not against people that come here
[19:54.280 --> 20:00.960]  legally and get the worker visas and do it i support that my name is bill bonner and
[20:00.960 --> 20:06.360]  i'm the president of the largest private news and research network in the world and i paid
[20:06.360 --> 20:12.040]  for this airtime because i have an important message to the american people there's a change
[20:12.040 --> 20:18.560]  coming that the government isn't telling you about this change has deep implications for
[20:18.560 --> 20:23.800]  life in america from where you shop to the doctors you visit and the family you want
[20:23.800 --> 20:30.960]  to protect look i've made predictions like this before thing is i was right then too

[20:38.800 --> 20:46.600]  that dot com companies would crash they did those who listened had a chance to save themselves
[20:46.600 --> 20:51.120]  but this has nothing to do with the stock market this will affect us all you can watch the

[23:57.240 --> 24:25.840]  okay let's start getting to some of the snippets of the testimony that's been going for a couple
[24:25.840 --> 24:31.760]  hours now in congress with hillary clinton her her full opening statement of 16 minutes
[24:31.760 --> 24:38.960]  long we've posted it to info wars.com clinton testimony ranking republican claims the democrats
[24:38.960 --> 24:43.880]  deliberately hindered Benghazi investigation well i mean of course they did they've been
[24:43.880 --> 24:48.600]  caught hindering it the whole time and so is it partially political the republicans
[24:48.600 --> 24:51.360]  are going after them well of course that's how the two parties are supposed to keep each
[24:51.360 --> 24:55.480]  other honest if one party commits crimes the other party's supposed to go after them and
[24:55.480 --> 25:02.240]  vice versa that's the separation of powers let's go to the former prosecutor trey gowdy
[25:02.240 --> 25:08.040]  here it is this committee is the first committee to review thousands of pages of documents from
[25:08.040 --> 25:12.560]  top state department personnel arrogant she is this committee is the first committee to
[25:12.560 --> 25:20.840]  demand access to relevant documents from the cia the fbi the defense even the white house
[25:20.840 --> 25:26.360]  this committee is the first committee to demand access to the emails to and from ambassador
[25:26.360 --> 25:34.160]  chris stevens how could an investigation possibly be considered serious without reviewing the
[25:34.160 --> 25:41.760]  emails of the person most knowledgeable about libya this committee is the first committee
[25:41.760 --> 25:47.360]  the only committee to uncover the fact that secretary clinton exclusively used personal
[25:47.360 --> 25:53.080]  email on her own personal server her official business and kept the public record including
[25:53.080 --> 25:58.760]  emails about Benghazi and libya in her own custody and control for almost two years after
[25:58.760 --> 26:04.160]  she left office now when you look at her that is a true mafia person that's ordered a lot
[26:04.160 --> 26:09.320]  of people killed and she goes on tv and says yeah we came to libya we came we saw he died
[26:09.320 --> 26:15.040]  haha i've been in combat planes getting shot at you know on the ground all lies i mean
[26:15.040 --> 26:20.920]  this is a criminal piece of trash and that particular freeze frame she looks just kind
[26:20.920 --> 26:27.080]  of sick most of it she's glaring with pure hatred let's pack it up a second or so again
[26:27.080 --> 26:31.240]  we're radio slash tv show your radio lists are the free feeds are in full wars dot com
[26:31.240 --> 26:35.040]  forward slash show radio is great for driving around your car listening to your office but
[26:35.040 --> 26:39.560]  if you're off work or whatever or on your smart phone you can go watch the free feeds but
[26:39.560 --> 26:47.360]  i tell you she is really giving him the laser beam look i am oh there you go oh look at that
[26:47.360 --> 26:53.840]  and she just stares like that for minute after minute after minute i tell you you gotta hand
[26:53.840 --> 27:03.640]  it to gowdy i mean he's going up against the gorgon now we've got Elijah Cummings an
[27:03.640 --> 27:12.400]  unspeakably horrid gun grabbing socialist up there trying to act like it's bizarre that
[27:12.400 --> 27:16.840]  politically people are coming after when they have been persecuting americans for their
[27:16.840 --> 27:24.400]  religious and political views in the last seven years like no other administration
[27:24.400 --> 27:30.880]  in us history except maybe abraham lincoln who would arrest people for their views as
[27:30.880 --> 27:38.480]  well that was during a civil war so let's go to Cummings here he is the problem is that
[27:38.480 --> 27:47.080]  the republican caucus did not like the answers they got from those investigations so they
[27:47.080 --> 27:58.320]  set up this select committee with no deadline and an unlimited budget and they set them
[27:58.320 --> 28:05.880]  loose madame secretary because you're running for president clearly it is possible to conduct
[28:05.880 --> 28:13.800]  a serious bipartisan investigation what is impossible is for any reasonable person to
[28:13.800 --> 28:20.840]  continue denying that republicans are squandering millions of taxpayer dollars on this abusive
[28:20.840 --> 28:29.720]  effort to derail secretary clinton's presidential campaign Cummings of course said it was ridiculous
[28:29.720 --> 28:34.200]  that lowest learner had to step down it was ridiculous the head of the environmental
[28:34.200 --> 28:39.480]  protection agency who got caught with a double set of emails a fake email a secret email had
[28:39.480 --> 28:47.720]  to step down he thinks you should be arrested if you don't believe in global warming we
[28:47.720 --> 28:55.360]  come back we're gonna play some of hillary's testimony but she hates his guts too you know
[28:55.360 --> 29:00.240]  joe biden obviously got threatened not to run insiders have gone public saying that
[29:00.240 --> 29:04.360]  he was told the clinton war machine will destroy you no kidding not that he's an angel but
[29:04.360 --> 29:07.760]  he's probably good compared to hillary i gotta tell you that's my real view on joe biden
[29:07.760 --> 29:12.560]  that's why he's not being put in he's not as ruthless he and he's bad news don't get
[29:12.560 --> 29:18.840]  me wrong but he's more of a good old-fashioned mobster type he doesn't really have it out
[29:18.840 --> 29:24.240]  for the country like the hillary or an obama and notice what she does the democrats that
[29:24.240 --> 29:33.320]  run against her so when we come back the witch i mean she really is a classical villain in
[29:33.320 --> 29:38.480]  her deeds and her actions but also sometimes you can judge a book by its cover i mean sometimes
[29:38.480 --> 29:44.200]  the cover matches what you find inside not always but sometimes sometimes you see you
[29:44.200 --> 29:48.720]  know a dead rotting horse on the road it's a dead rotting horse and stinks we're on the
[29:48.720 --> 29:59.720]  march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network hillary clinton will
[29:59.720 --> 30:04.080]  testify in front of the Benghazi committee and of course she's gonna try and spin this
[30:04.080 --> 30:09.320]  as just partisan politics but let's look at the facts they lied one of the first moves
[30:09.320 --> 30:14.720]  the obama administration made after the Benghazi attack was to contact youtube in an apparent
[30:14.720 --> 30:19.420]  attempt to blame the attack on an obscure pastor john video this is according to state
[30:19.420 --> 30:24.440]  department documents obtained by judicial watch later the administration famously claimed
[30:24.440 --> 30:29.520]  the attack was provoked by another youtube video innocence of muslims made by an egyptian
[30:29.520 --> 30:34.600]  born filmmaker while they were plotting an enormous lie on the public former navy seal
[30:34.600 --> 30:40.360]  david uben was still trapped on the roof of the Benghazi annex for 20 hours the obama
[30:40.360 --> 30:45.080]  administration later jailed the filmmaker behind innocence of muslims in fact he was
[30:45.080 --> 30:49.800]  the only man who's been captured and imprisoned in the aftermath of the Benghazi terrorist
[30:49.800 --> 30:58.880]  attack what difference at this point does it make read more now at info wars dot com

[33:28.200 --> 33:35.960]  the governing class and its minions of mercenaries are coming to finish off america and seize the
[33:35.960 --> 33:44.200]  great prize they've already basically wrecked the nation but they want to drive the final nails
[33:44.200 --> 33:49.000]  into the coffin of the republic they want to come after the bitter clingers i don't care if you're
[33:49.000 --> 33:56.280]  an old black woman living in wisconsin or you're a young farmer who's a white guy living in texas
[33:57.080 --> 34:03.800]  or whether you're a hispanic auto parts store owner in florida the globalists are applying
[34:03.800 --> 34:11.080]  the same family destroying tax and spend globalist programs of wealth redistribution
[34:11.080 --> 34:18.440]  and design not to empower the poor but to swell the numbers of the poor since the great society
[34:18.440 --> 34:25.640]  since socialism has been brought to bear in this country we've gone from the top 10 percent
[34:25.640 --> 34:33.240]  having half the wealth to 2 percent having close to 90 percent 87 88 percent you look at those
[34:33.240 --> 34:38.440]  numbers they vary western country to western country but that's basically the numbers and then they
[34:38.440 --> 34:45.000]  how more socialism is the answer more wealth redistribution you could redistribute all the real
[34:45.000 --> 34:51.160]  wealth in the united states to the welfare class and in a year or two they'd be broke
[34:52.120 --> 34:55.480]  and you know there's a quite a few documentaries i've seen several of them
[34:56.680 --> 35:02.360]  made on the fact that they could be old white people young white people old black people young
[35:02.360 --> 35:12.200]  black people old hispanics young hispanics it's people are people maybe one out of 100 is what
[35:12.200 --> 35:15.400]  these documentaries and books written on the subject i found it fascinating in fact we ought to
[35:16.520 --> 35:19.560]  get some of those filmmakers on and we've made some of those documentaries
[35:21.240 --> 35:25.080]  i forget the names i've seen them on hbo seen them on discovery channel you've probably all seen
[35:25.080 --> 35:30.200]  them too where it follows somebody over two years after they win 50 million dollars or 100 million
[35:30.200 --> 35:36.200]  dollars and the more you win the worse it is your whole family turns against you you get all these
[35:36.200 --> 35:45.160]  swindlers show up you end up going bankrupt and the globalists have come in and siphoned off the
[35:45.160 --> 35:51.480]  wealth taken it offshore overseas to build up all these big factories and command bases and now
[35:51.480 --> 35:58.280]  america is getting ready to be hung out to dry and you've got a get rich quick lottery obsessed
[35:58.280 --> 36:07.400]  type population who think they're going to basically you know get rear-ended somebody and
[36:07.400 --> 36:12.520]  that their ships going to come in this morning i was on the elliptical looking like five different
[36:12.520 --> 36:19.320]  television sets at the gym in front of me and at 1.3 of the five tv's were on commercial
[36:21.160 --> 36:26.200]  and it was all i guess local ads running on different channels and it was all lawyer ads
[36:26.200 --> 36:31.640]  about 1.4 million judgment 2.2 million judgment you know we could even give you cash advances
[36:31.640 --> 36:35.480]  when we take your case you've been rear-ended got hurt on the job call us
[36:39.320 --> 36:46.200]  and it goes on and on and on most people can't handle power and success and especially if you
[36:46.200 --> 36:53.480]  didn't earn it it will destroy you and everybody around you will end up thinking it's about who's
[36:53.480 --> 37:00.280]  on the top of the totem pole and not the fact that whoever is at the top of the totem pole
[37:00.280 --> 37:07.320]  took all these people with them to even build the structure to exist and now the middle class
[37:07.320 --> 37:13.160]  that built this country of every race color and creed is being destroyed numbers came out yesterday
[37:13.160 --> 37:20.920]  it's the smallest it's ever been in this country's history 240 years black unemployment is double what
[37:20.920 --> 37:26.840]  it was seven years ago but it doesn't matter obama and his justice department have given people
[37:26.840 --> 37:35.640]  racial victory all and racial rhetoric and racial identity not to empower a culture but to wound it
[37:35.640 --> 37:40.360]  to hurt it so the globalists can give the communities their hand
[37:43.160 --> 37:47.960]  and with the other hand they stab them politically socially culturally on the neck we're all
[37:47.960 --> 37:54.520]  in the same boat and i was against bush because he was corrupt and had bad people around him
[37:54.520 --> 38:00.120]  not and people like but the democrats are worse it doesn't matter you have to oppose corruption
[38:00.120 --> 38:07.720]  but now hillary clinton barack obama is the worst thing i've ever seen jonathan turley often quoted
[38:07.720 --> 38:13.320]  but many other liberal professors that are constitutional lawyers have said obama is far worse
[38:13.320 --> 38:20.280]  than bush and the last time turley was on a few years ago was to try to get him back on
[38:20.280 --> 38:27.160]  i said how many times worse he said he said about three times worse on average maybe 10 times worse
[38:27.160 --> 38:32.920]  on persecuting the press and whistleblowers he's the worst ever but you've got this identity politics
[38:32.920 --> 38:40.120]  because he's supposedly part black i mean i wish for a cobalt was white because he'd be in jail right
[38:40.120 --> 38:51.160]  now i mean i would love to have a ben karsten over a hillary clinton and i'm not looking at what
[38:51.160 --> 38:55.160]  color he is even though he's kind of a police state guy on the vaccines and a few other issues
[38:55.160 --> 38:59.960]  i think he's genuine and means what he's saying and he could be informed they don't want somebody
[38:59.960 --> 39:10.680]  like ben karsten in there they want somebody that'll continue this corruption and i know you know that
[39:10.680 --> 39:15.000]  the big 64 billion dollar question is donald trump is he for real because if he is for real
[39:15.000 --> 39:19.240]  they're gonna come after him and i don't mean just politically let's go to hillary clinton
[39:19.240 --> 39:26.520]  here's our part of our opening statement as secretary of state i had the honor to lead
[39:26.520 --> 39:34.520]  and the responsibility to support nearly 70 000 diplomats and development experts across the globe
[39:36.600 --> 39:49.640]  losing any one of them as we did in iraq afghanistan mexico hady and libya during my tenure was deeply
[39:49.640 --> 39:59.560]  painful for our entire state department and usa id family and for me personally i was the one who
[39:59.560 --> 40:08.280]  asked christ to go to libya as our envoy i was the one who recommended him to be our ambassador
[40:08.280 --> 40:17.480]  to the president after the attacks i stood next to president obama as marines carried his casket
[40:17.480 --> 40:23.640]  and those of the other three americans off the plane at andrew's air force base
[40:25.240 --> 40:31.960]  i took responsibility you go to people's funerals and as part of that before i left office i launched
[40:31.960 --> 40:38.600]  reforms to better protect our people in the field and help reduce the chance of another tragedy
[40:39.160 --> 40:45.960]  happening in the future this is a woman who launched the arab spring operation of the state
[40:45.960 --> 40:52.120]  department who used the power of the state department to bypass federal law on the transfer
[40:52.120 --> 40:58.280]  of weapons to terrorist states and dictators and she didn't just do it to some covert operation
[40:58.280 --> 41:05.880]  approved by the president which it was still bypassing congress it goes beyond iran contra
[41:07.000 --> 41:14.120]  because they were arming al qaeda to not take down some enemy and then remove them no
[41:14.120 --> 41:20.840]  no to be kept in power and to deindustrialize and ruin countries as a destabilization program
[41:20.840 --> 41:27.160]  which they now admit it was libya is wrecked they tried to wreck egypt the most populous nation
[41:27.160 --> 41:32.200]  in the middle east and for one year we're able to do it and egypt freaked out and said your
[41:32.200 --> 41:36.840]  government tried to ruin us tried to put jihadis in blew up all the churches attacked our military
[41:36.840 --> 41:42.280]  bases we have removed it and then they've had trials proving obama was funding hundreds of
[41:42.280 --> 41:50.200]  millions a month through kenya and his family to overthrow egypt and actually conquer it for
[41:50.200 --> 41:56.920]  radical muslims and that he was going to be like the king of it and get money from it i mean
[41:56.920 --> 42:02.600]  that's bolder than i thought that's that's science fiction movie stuff or a us president's
[42:02.600 --> 42:09.800]  knocking countries over for his family to run it and really hates christians in the middle east
[42:09.800 --> 42:14.200]  so much that he has them all slaughtered i mean when you look at hillary you look at obama these
[42:14.200 --> 42:20.360]  people really want to kill christians they really are devils folks this isn't the exorcist this isn't
[42:20.360 --> 42:28.120]  a movie where some evil clown comes in and kills your kids okay this is the government in syria
[42:28.120 --> 42:34.040]  in iraq in libya in egypt murdering every christian they can get their hands on
[42:34.040 --> 42:40.520]  air dropping weapons to them saying hey al nazar is the non radical how dare
[42:40.520 --> 42:51.080]  putin bomb them and then it said roiders and ap al nazar the al qaeda operation in syria i mean i
[42:51.080 --> 42:54.520]  know they're al qaeda the pentagon knows they're al qaeda why do you think all our generals and
[42:54.520 --> 42:58.680]  colonels have gone crazy saying we're not gonna be part of this because they'll they'll do some
[42:58.680 --> 43:02.200]  corrupt stuff in the name of the greater good that's how they got corrupted to begin with but
[43:02.200 --> 43:07.080]  now it's gotten so bad they've hit that moment where larry nickles is there offloading with
[43:07.080 --> 43:13.400]  plain loads the c 130s of cocaine in black operations at mina and kids are getting killed
[43:13.400 --> 43:18.280]  in the neighborhood that see it and like and nickles literally fell down on the ground started
[43:18.280 --> 43:25.480]  crying and god hit him and he totally repented i mean what's it take train loads of cocaine
[43:25.480 --> 43:32.840]  18 you know 12 year olds getting killed because they saw it i mean how far will you go in backing
[43:32.840 --> 43:36.600]  this corrupt system is what i'm asking people in government corporations how far
[43:39.880 --> 43:44.120]  his dad was dying of lung cancer and he was ashamed even though his dad didn't know
[43:46.040 --> 43:49.480]  i know the feeling he didn't tell me this when he said he was ashamed his dad was dying of cancer
[43:49.480 --> 43:52.680]  what would happen if he found out because it was starting to come out in the news
[43:52.680 --> 43:57.800]  was and i guarantee i know what nickles thought i bet he thought i don't want daddy to die but
[43:57.800 --> 44:00.760]  boy maybe it's good if he does die before he learns what i'm involved in
[44:03.160 --> 44:05.880]  he said that he said he don't want his dad to find out what he was involved in and he started
[44:05.880 --> 44:13.800]  thinking about his daughter who was 12 13 years old started thinking about what happened if she got
[44:13.800 --> 44:21.880]  on cocaine but see people ask me why do you have somebody like that on when he's done so many evil
[44:21.880 --> 44:29.240]  things and black operations in latin america and you know been a basically a hit man for the clintons
[44:29.240 --> 44:37.640]  is the word dixie mafia and i love how he said he didn't even know they were basically the heads
[44:37.640 --> 44:43.960]  of the dixie mafia in arkansas until later that's how compartmentalized this stuff is
[44:46.840 --> 44:51.320]  but who i really feel sorry for are people that never hit bottom who never hit their knees
[44:51.320 --> 44:56.840]  who never repent people that think it's funny that all this is going on it's not funny
[44:57.720 --> 45:01.080]  nickles had a soul he could feel it coming back on his family
[45:05.400 --> 45:09.080]  don't any of you out there i'm talking to people that serve this system you have a soul
[45:09.080 --> 45:14.920]  you think it's cute all this evil before i go to the live feed and just pop it on what they're
[45:14.920 --> 45:20.280]  doing i want to go to a piece darin mcbrain put together and it's a tough job because there's so
[45:20.280 --> 45:23.960]  many of these clips and how do you put them all in you know together in a congruent way this is
[45:23.960 --> 45:29.160]  just the last month we played other clips compilations of world leaders other leaders our leaders
[45:29.720 --> 45:33.080]  our hijackers calling for taking our guns but
[45:36.840 --> 45:43.480]  this is what they're currently saying so with everything else going on just remember they're
[45:43.480 --> 45:50.840]  coming for our guns and hillary clinton means a full out of salt for another four to eight years
[45:50.840 --> 45:55.000]  and i tell you you think things are bad under obama holds your breath folks because
[45:57.800 --> 46:01.000]  it might just be better not even be around and then to have this lady writing things and i mean
[46:01.000 --> 46:05.720]  that is a figure of speech i personal fight to the end i'll never commit suicide i'll never surrender
[46:05.720 --> 46:09.640]  but as a nation it makes you wonder if you should bring more children into the world
[46:09.640 --> 46:17.560]  let's go ahead and go to this compilation of the enemy openly announcing their intentions
[46:17.560 --> 46:21.240]  all out of the other side of their mouth saying no one's coming after your guns here it is
[46:21.880 --> 46:27.800]  you know australia is a good example canada is a good example the uk is a good example why
[46:28.920 --> 46:33.880]  because each of them had mass killings somebody somewhere will comment and say
[46:33.880 --> 46:40.920]  hey obama politicized this issue well this is something we should politicize i'm not going
[46:40.920 --> 46:46.840]  to carry a gun i don't want to be involved in the gun fight if i could have gotten 51 votes in the
[46:46.840 --> 46:55.080]  senate of the united states for an outright ban picking up every one of them mr and mrs america
[46:55.080 --> 47:07.560]  turn them all in go ahead make my day so the notion that gun laws don't work it's not borne
[47:07.560 --> 47:14.600]  out by the evidence he says that the chicago police had a plan over this bloody fourth of july weekend
[47:14.600 --> 47:21.160]  nonetheless as you indicated cori there was a count of casualties that could have been from
[47:21.160 --> 47:27.640]  afghanistan or iraq will make it harder for law-abiding citizens and criminals will still get
[47:27.640 --> 47:36.440]  their guns in many cases the offenders uh felons a sum out on parole some out on bond we have to
[47:36.440 --> 47:42.360]  respect the tradition in this country of people who want to defend themselves and their family
[47:42.360 --> 47:49.880]  from violence there are people at high levels in this government who have bodyguards 24 hours a
[47:49.880 --> 47:56.760]  day seven days a week the average american does not have that mayor bloomberg why why why can you
[47:56.760 --> 48:01.720]  defend yourself but not the majority of americans i mean look at look at the team of security you
[48:01.720 --> 48:07.480]  got every day every school at every level one thing that i think is clear with young people and
[48:07.480 --> 48:12.120]  with adults as well is that we just have to be repetitive about this that we need to do this
[48:12.120 --> 48:17.400]  every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly
[48:17.400 --> 48:23.560]  different way was this the weapon of choice for a new kind of terrorist when a five-year-old girl
[48:23.560 --> 48:29.400]  said she and a classmate should shoot each other with bubbles the school called it a terrorist
[48:29.400 --> 48:34.760]  threat ak-47s belonging to the hands of soldiers not in the hands of criminals you know the right
[48:34.760 --> 48:39.960]  to bear arms is because that's the last form of defense against tyranny lay down your arms you
[48:39.960 --> 48:46.840]  damn troubles and we don't need the ability to arm ourselves against the army for the police what kind
[48:46.840 --> 48:50.840]  of a situation in the u.s would you see that happening i mean we've got a lot of constitution
[48:50.840 --> 48:55.640]  listening to a lot of people that it's not power weapons discover the courage you would help the
[48:55.640 --> 49:02.200]  government with potentially their biggest problem us to say we're not turning our guns in and we're
[49:02.200 --> 49:10.440]  not running and we're not knocking down if you want to take us rallying patriots worldwide in
[49:10.440 --> 49:31.000]  defense of human liberty it's alex jones powerful piece put together by darryl Mcbrane when we
[49:31.000 --> 49:35.800]  come back from break i'm going to play a clip of the mother of sean smith one of the four americans
[49:35.800 --> 49:43.160]  killed the consulate ben gazi saying that hillary's lying and i tell you the fact that joe biden has
[49:43.160 --> 49:49.480]  dropped out just shows how powerful hillary clinton is or never got in the fact that he
[49:49.480 --> 49:56.360]  dropped out of the hype that he might run just shows you that hillary's coming and she's gotten
[49:56.360 --> 50:02.760]  more money than all presidential candidates combined that was in mainstream news yesterday i
[50:02.760 --> 50:07.000]  didn't even know that i knew she'd gotten the most i didn't know it was more than everybody
[50:08.520 --> 50:14.280]  and then her donors are the exact same donors as jeb bush that was also in the news yesterday
[50:17.240 --> 50:22.040]  and then you've got all these democrats nancy polosi harry reid all the usual suspects
[50:22.040 --> 50:33.160]  endorsing endorsing paul ryan who's got an f rating from conservative grips
[50:34.440 --> 50:39.880]  and and and he's unpopular we know he's calm but they just control the leadership and they
[50:39.880 --> 50:45.000]  just keep forcing and foisting and you have democrats vote in the republican speaker
[50:45.000 --> 50:49.080]  with a bunch of traders i mean it's just but we're still in the fight we force bain around
[50:49.080 --> 50:53.720]  we're going to go after ryan we got mccarthy out of there we're not going to stop we're
[50:53.720 --> 50:57.240]  going to come back with this clip of this mother's powerful stay with us
[51:01.560 --> 51:07.480]  earthquake floods winter storms prolonged power outages or war each of us have had that moment
[51:07.480 --> 51:12.040]  when we recognize that we need to be better prepared we typically do the same thing we
[51:12.040 --> 51:17.080]  start with food storage then we address the need for water but have you considered heat storage
[51:17.080 --> 51:21.560]  i'm talking about staying warm in the cold here are some things for you to consider
[51:21.560 --> 51:26.040]  how will i keep my family warm the standard answers are firewood coal or propane but the
[51:26.040 --> 51:31.720]  problem with that if you need to be on the move is you can't take it with you another concern
[51:31.720 --> 51:36.120]  there may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke like in times of war there may
[51:36.120 --> 51:41.320]  even come a time when you can't burn fuel the answers may be simpler and less costly than you
[51:41.320 --> 51:47.160]  think for these answers go to fortress clothing dot com again fortress clothing dot com has the
[51:47.160 --> 51:53.400]  answers to your heat storage dilemma don't get stuck in the cold fortress clothing dot com

[52:17.560 --> 52:22.360]  that iodine a crude form of it be added to table salt because of the incredible health problems

[54:23.240 --> 54:29.400]  this point does it make it is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to
[54:29.400 --> 54:35.320]  prevent it from ever happening again senator when you heard that what went through your mind
[54:36.600 --> 54:45.320]  she's lying she's absolutely lying she told me something entirely different at the casket
[54:45.320 --> 54:51.000]  ceremony she said it was the cause of the the video and that she would get back to me and tell me
[54:51.000 --> 54:56.920]  what happened with my son she has not only not gotten back to me but all i've ever heard is that i
[54:56.920 --> 55:04.040]  am not not to know because i'm not a member of the immediate family i still want to know i saw on
[55:04.040 --> 55:11.400]  tv the bloody fingerprints on the walls over there i asked specifically are those my son's
[55:11.400 --> 55:16.920]  fingerprints crawling down the wall the bloody fingerprints nobody ever got back to me on that
[55:16.920 --> 55:23.160]  are those his fingerprints were those his fingerprints what happened somebody's got to tell me

[55:33.480 --> 55:37.320]  want to toot my horn i don't have the staff i don't have the crew to even go back and show it
[55:37.320 --> 55:44.200]  all to you your listeners you've your viewers you saw it and you can go back to when ben gauzy broke
[55:44.200 --> 55:49.000]  you can go back to colonel schaefer on the show and posh plumbly on the broadcast and under whistle
[55:49.000 --> 55:58.040]  blowers we've known since the first week what happened we had steve pacenikon and a lot of
[55:58.040 --> 56:01.960]  folks here steve pacenikon they don't trust him because of the positions he's been in i'm not
[56:01.960 --> 56:08.360]  saying you should trust him but look at what he's told us over the years it's turned out to basically
[56:08.360 --> 56:14.600]  be true and he does do manipulative stuff where he was like jeb bush had run he's a really great
[56:14.600 --> 56:19.560]  leader i really like him when he's saying george w bush is involved in 9 11 and should you know
[56:19.560 --> 56:25.320]  go on trial for treason and then it turns out he's been at the council on foreign relations
[56:25.320 --> 56:31.960]  advising them to run jeb bush to set jeb bush up so they could then make it about 9 11 i mean
[56:31.960 --> 56:36.840]  when you're doing with pacenik it is serious psychological warfare and he's not doing it
[56:36.840 --> 56:40.760]  to this broadcast he's here saying america's going to win we're going to take the country back
[56:40.760 --> 56:44.600]  we're going to be positive our military is going to be patriotic and not go along with this
[56:46.120 --> 56:52.120]  and it's been happening i'm not saying pacenik is even five percent of the whole resistance
[56:52.120 --> 56:59.400]  at that level but what he's saying is true and is being listened to and this broadcast is a format
[56:59.400 --> 57:06.440]  for that to happen and we know what happened at bengasi it was an arms transfer stevens wouldn't
[57:06.440 --> 57:11.160]  go along with it giving al qaeda stinger missiles so they sent the group over that ran security from
[57:11.160 --> 57:17.960]  bengasi that the us had hired to murder him there was a three hour five hour six hour seven
[57:17.960 --> 57:23.800]  hour finally seven and a half hour stand down and a couple hours into it cia navy seals because
[57:23.800 --> 57:30.040]  there's navy seals all that that that you graduate into the cia and into commando units after that
[57:30.040 --> 57:35.800]  there's a bunch of other levels above it obviously two of them go down there hold them down for about
[57:35.800 --> 57:40.600]  three four hours they get so mad the jihadis go crazy they think they've been set up in a trap
[57:43.960 --> 57:48.200]  this was the state department taking out the witnesses to their criminal activity
[57:49.800 --> 57:53.640]  and now we know i mean we said years ago when it happened it was going to be sent to syria
[57:53.640 --> 57:58.040]  and it was a setup for that and now it's been confirmed all right we're about to go to break
[57:58.040 --> 58:01.960]  if you believe in this hardcore information if you want to counter the globalists we need you

[01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:27.640]  he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:37.480]  welcome back ladies and gentlemen we're going to get into some really important science in fact
[01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:41.880]  i meant to print this off this morning or send it to you well you guys print me the heaven and
[01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:50.120]  post Reuters about fluoride causing brain damage also how up in blacks uh in major studies it's
[01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:54.680]  much worse for black people for whatever physiological reason it's like well-known
[01:00:54.680 --> 01:01:01.080]  native americans can't drink as much alcohol uh as a european can in fact it's on record that europeans
[01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:06.600]  can drink and livers handle on average more alcohol than any other group and that's because
[01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:14.360]  isage man stored most of their food for the winter as alcohol and so europeans are true
[01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:20.840]  alcoholic creatures uh and that's just a fact our ancestors that couldn't handle it all died out
[01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:27.640]  you know in the cave slarping the mead uh but it's not some racist thing to point out that
[01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:33.800]  native americans cannot hold their liquor and are extremely easy to get addicted to it uh and it's
[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:41.640]  it's a fact in scientific studies that hydrofluorosilic acid is i mean it's bad for hispanics
[01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:49.640]  it's bad for whites it's bad for asians and of course hispanics are asian european arabic so
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:56.680]  that's why people in spain have higher rates of hiv than people say in germany because they
[01:01:56.680 --> 01:02:03.160]  have some african background and they have receptor sites for the uh on their team lymphocytes for
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:08.120]  the hiv but but again i digress it's just that's why science and knowledge just all interconnects
[01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:12.440]  i'ma spend about 20 minutes getting into things we can do and the fight against fluoride
[01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:19.720]  and glyphosate that's in the water and all the rest of it coming up uh and then we have
[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:24.600]  robert kiyosaki rich dad poor dad coming on to talk about the economy what he sees happening in the
[01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:29.560]  world uh the election and then jacari jackson has got a whole bunch of news that he's going to be
[01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:35.080]  breaking down and covering in the fourth hour it's become so popular since we relaunched it a
[01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:40.040]  lot of stations picking up that fourth hour i want to thank them for picking up the wrap-up
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:45.720]  show overdrive i mean it's kind of all that i don't know what to call it yet because they cover a
[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:49.400]  lot of the news i didn't get to they cover a lot of the breaking news they they have a lot of special
[01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:56.920]  guests on a lot of special reports it's just a really strong fourth hour i'd say many days when
[01:02:56.920 --> 01:03:01.080]  i turn into it around the office while i'm here it's just as good or better because i tend to get
[01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:06.840]  on these long rant babble sessions uh than even my own broadcast that we call in full wars live
[01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:14.200]  that's been on the air 18 years in this time slot i've been on air 21 years uh coming up
[01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:23.640]  in february it'll be 21 years in four months that we have been broadcasting uh on the radio and
[01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:31.000]  slash tv now clinton has sickeningly and and and we're going to have this clip coming up
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:35.560]  after the guest leaves is clinton on ben gazi christopher stevens was responsible for his own
[01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:43.160]  security throwing a dead man you murdered premeditatedly under the bus that story is up on
[01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:50.520]  info wars dot com that is just bomb shell statement that is in the washington times
[01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:56.200]  absolutely over the top sickening uh i am just beside myself right now
[01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:04.280]  we now know that the turkish ambassador told him to let them transfer the stinger missiles out of
[01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:07.720]  qaddafi's warehouses to them that they were right there at the warehouses at the substation
[01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:14.200]  he said no they didn't want to have a record they just made the cold-blooded decision it's so
[01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:18.520]  important to bring down syria and to be able to shoot down russian aircraft and stuff they
[01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:27.400]  knew were coming that they actually murdered him but but he fought back the americans held that alamo
[01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:33.880]  for seven and a half hours and because they held the alamo for seven hours there it has been a
[01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:40.520]  gazi shocker attack on stevens was a professional job that's colonel shaver by the way we had to
[01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:46.520]  change the headline he got called in and chewed out and the secret of grips he's part of and it
[01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:54.120]  was was a hit you know but he had us change that headline uh shafer likes to come on but he doesn't
[01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:59.960]  like to come on because he gets in so much trouble and he does want to keep up to date with what's

[01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:40.760]  was the prophet muhammad movie trailer that caused it when it turns out they wanted to blame some
[01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:46.600]  other preacher for the arab spring and the riots that they basically launched to take over the
[01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:54.600]  middle east as the cover for their jihad saudi arabian takeover that is coming up at the bottom

[01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:41.720]  the mother of shawn smith and said that hillary is lying the new york times even documents how
[01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:48.040]  hillary's story has changed over and over again we will break all of this down from info wars.com
[01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:57.160]  prisonplanet.com and drudgereport.com now for the next 20 30 minutes i'm gonna give am and fm radio
[01:09:57.160 --> 01:10:04.360]  stations a piece of my mind in a positive way in a loving way in a good way and just continue with
[01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:13.080]  the policy of absolute total and complete uh transparency i won the talkers national award
[01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:17.880]  five years ago i think it was i was the cover of talkers magazine i was listed as been the top
[01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:23.160]  ten talk show host in the country and they've you know looked at my numbers just from rated
[01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:28.040]  stations that actually subscribed to the arbitra and then i had about 360 something thousand
[01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:33.640]  listeners every 15 minutes about three million a day on terrestrial radio it's a lot bigger than
[01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:37.480]  that with podcasts and videos and everything i mean and and and we we have more affiliates now
[01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:42.760]  it's about four million a day terrestrial radio about three four million a day just on youtube
[01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:49.640]  alone you start doing the numbers it's about ten million a day but talk radio itself is having a
[01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:54.520]  lot of problems it's been imploding clear channels been taken over by democratic party type folks
[01:10:56.120 --> 01:10:59.800]  i'm not involved with clear channel but they had some patriots there that did stuff like put me on
[01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:05.000]  xm they got great ratings made a bunch of money it was great success i mean clear channel put me
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:09.400]  on their channels on xm that they own they owned like half of them and i was told it's a democrat
[01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:15.960]  takeover you and about a hundred other libertarians are being kicked off so that's all going on that
[01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:19.960]  said we're going on and been on a major station new york will make that announcement next week
[01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:25.400]  with the station manager we've gained big affiliates across the country we're approaching 200 right now
[01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:30.200]  so despite all their censorship we're having some big success
[01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:38.120]  that said though at talkers i was there to speak to industry heads about my success but also how
[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:43.880]  i funded myself and i said listen ad agencies are fine local sales are fine there's still huge
[01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:48.840]  loyal audiences to am and fm radio but you've got a supplement not just with a station coffee cup
[01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:57.560]  or a station t-shirt or live station events you've really got to tell listeners if you believe
[01:11:57.560 --> 01:12:04.280]  in what you're hearing it's expensive to run this station we need you to buy products and then you
[01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:09.560]  find hot products you buy a bunch of them and you hire somebody in a shipping department to ship
[01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:16.360]  those out we went from 15 years ago being half funded with advertising half funded within house
[01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:22.360]  to like 80 percent funded now in-house because advertising even though it's waned for other
[01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:28.440]  folks we got to knock it down our doors it just can't compete with selling our own products to
[01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:34.920]  fund our operation then i take like 95 percent of the money and put it right back in the the main
[01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:40.600]  mission is to reach out to people and i've got a stack of liners i'm in i need to cut partnering
[01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:44.040]  with stations for young jebedee i'm trying to do that we're a little overwhelmed i'm talking
[01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:50.200]  other station managers about other things we can do to work with them but instead of coming
[01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:54.280]  and speaking at people's stations which they asked me every day to go here go there and i plan next
[01:12:54.280 --> 01:13:00.360]  year to go to at least 20 stations or so but i'll have to go to a few on each leg so i do it every
[01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:03.880]  few months and then i hit like six seven stations and give speeches and the rest of it you know
[01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:08.200]  they sell tickets for 20 dollars a piece the station makes a little money which they need to stay on
[01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:15.320]  folks the globalists spend trillions of dollars giving money into the media to push their propaganda
[01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:20.280]  to push their lives well you're going to have to financially support by becoming sponsors being
[01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:26.040]  sponsors locally spreading the word isn't just enough in this fight or buying products from the
[01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:33.160]  station directly and i really want to encourage stations that that's the answer that is really
[01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:39.880]  the answer i would find a popular knife buy it and mass sell it at a discount i'd find a popular
[01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:48.040]  supplement sell it i would uh water filters whatever that's the model and that's what glimbeck's
[01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:53.560]  been quietly doing for seven years and then they admit copying our model i've talked to
[01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:56.600]  executives that work with him and folks that did work with him and they sit there and copy
[01:13:56.600 --> 01:14:00.760]  everything we do and then do it on a bigger scale more successful well not more successful because
[01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:05.720]  all's not happy and beckland with his attempt i'm not going to i wish him well i hope he becomes
[01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:09.880]  very successful but let's just say he spent his capital we're not we we live in our means
[01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:18.040]  so we need to be successful and instead of plugging products every every segment like other
[01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:23.880]  hosts have to do to make ends meet we plug once an hour i plugged for 45 seconds last hour but to
[01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:29.000]  make up for that once a week once every two weeks i'll do 30 minutes an hour of informative
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:34.920]  infomercial where i'm just open about it and say hey buy these high quality water filters
[01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:41.240]  it helps fund our operation here's the studies these are really some of the best and they're
[01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:45.880]  very inexpensive i think you don't want to drink fluoride and glyphosate and all the other herbicides
[01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:53.080]  and pesticides it's a win-win i mean when you tune into cbs news abc news nbc you know in the
[01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:56.840]  morning the whole thing's a product placement infomercial they're just not telling you
[01:14:56.840 --> 01:15:04.840]  me and they wouldn't survive if they didn't do that too so we're about 10 infomercial they're
[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:10.280]  like 90 so that's the difference now that said it'll be with us till about 40 after because i
[01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:16.520]  could go into him late then we'll get to all the other news i could carry a hundred water filters
[01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:21.880]  like amazon does and i would make a lot more money the problem is we look at the studies we
[01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:29.560]  look at the test if it doesn't cut out to non-detectable levels or 9999 herbicides fluoride glyphosate
[01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:37.080]  all the other fuel additives and stuff i'm not going to promote and sell a water filter that
[01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:42.120]  doesn't really do a great job that's why we only carry like three brands and you can look at different
[01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:46.680]  specs and debate which is better the point is they're all excellent at info or store.com
[01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:51.880]  but it's we've only carried like three brands and we haven't added a new brand about two years
[01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:57.640]  just because they're it's hard to find folks that are involved in really high quality i was told
[01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:02.920]  by matt redhawk the owner of my patreon supply of foods two years ago that he was working with
[01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:06.920]  the top scientists and i looked this guy up he is like the maker of most of the famous water
[01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:13.000]  filters you see advertised and he just keeps upping the game he's a scientist got multiple
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:18.360]  scientific degrees and he said i'm coming out with something that i think for the cost is the
[01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:22.760]  best out there and we looked at it we looked at the studies the the third party studies those are
[01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:30.840]  up on infowarstore.com the alexa pure pro is the latest water filtration family that we're adding
[01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:36.840]  an infowarstore.com and it really is a game changer i love that word because that's what we look for
[01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:46.840]  as game changers dr evan e coslow is our guest he has a phd and his chief executive officer of kx
[01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:52.280]  technologies founded 89 dr coslow has written over 100 articles and papers holds over 30 patents
[01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:57.960]  and is the original inventor of the solid state extrusion process for carbon block technology
[01:16:57.960 --> 01:17:02.280]  and he holds those patents dr coslow holds a bachelor's degree in engineering a master's degree
[01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:08.360]  in forestry from Yale university and a doctorate and in agriculture engineering at cornell university
[01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:12.600]  i'm not going to go over all of it but he's a scientist and engineer and we're going to skip
[01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:17.080]  this break to give him more time i appreciate him coming on it's just that i wanted to preface this
[01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:23.240]  broadcast with what we're doing here funding the operation with stuff that helps you and that helps
[01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:28.920]  us get the word out very affordable does 5000 gallons in the filters live stainless steel
[01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:33.880]  construction easy assembly low maintenance replacement filters are simple to install raw
[01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:41.560]  water capacity 7.5 liters 2.25 gallons fresh water capacity 2.25 gallons and they've got several
[01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:48.760]  different models large ones small ones medium sized ones really is super high quality and we're
[01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:54.520]  really happy to add it and red hawk says and the engineer says this is the best this is the best
[01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:59.080]  and this is the top guy and this is this is the latest in what his cutting edge technology has
[01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:05.880]  been able to bring folks alexa pure pro so sir thank you so much for coming on with us doctor
[01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:11.640]  hey good morning alex uh tell us about water filtration why you think it's important and
[01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:14.840]  how was it engineer you got into it and how you became pretty much the name in it
[01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:23.800]  my background goes back uh almost uh 35 years i joined um what is today the largest filter company
[01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:29.720]  in america and uh eventually i became uh the tech director of their nuclear biological and chemical
[01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:36.280]  defense division and uh during that time we began to look very carefully at building filters that
[01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:43.640]  could handle effectively all threats uh for the u.s. army uh and for foreign national government
[01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:49.080]  and basically these kinds of technologies emerge from that research uh i've been at it pretty much
[01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:57.800]  since then i have about um probably about 130 patents pending or issued uh in this field and uh
[01:18:57.800 --> 01:19:03.000]  so i've been involved in almost every major commercial filter that's gone out to the consumer
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:09.080]  since the 1980s now that said we have it out of the gates introductory offer discounted
[01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:15.400]  with the official launch of alexa pure pro at infowarstore.com uh breakdown sir why
[01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:21.080]  uh you've been saying that this is all of your knowledge the latest technology for the lowest
[01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:27.160]  price i mean why this is such a game changer well this is the probably the most sophisticated and
[01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:33.800]  most complex filter that we've ever conceived um it handles a broader range of contaminants
[01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:39.400]  than just anything i've ever attempted uh and i've been involved in every major filter that's
[01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:45.400]  been developed really in the united states uh in 30 years uh there is nothing that removes such a
[01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:51.000]  broad spectrum of contaminants it takes out metals non-metals uh organic compounds uh
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:57.400]  herbicides pesticides uh it takes out pharmaceuticals uh that can get break into your water today
[01:19:57.400 --> 01:20:04.040]  it's so hormones so it's a tremendously powerful filter that takes out the broadest spectrum of
[01:20:04.040 --> 01:20:10.840]  contaminants that we've ever attempted in a single filter wow and how are you able to do this just
[01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:15.960]  from research or has the process he's gotten better with the manufacturing plants has had
[01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:20.040]  just the general technologies progressed to the level of to be able to have something
[01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:24.440]  that works this good this fast this affordable because i remember redhawk telling me years ago
[01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:28.920]  wait till you see how fast it flows and you know years of development and when i got it
[01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:34.360]  it is undoubtedly the fastest gravity filter i've ever seen absolutely alex the the amazing thing
[01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:40.840]  about this filter is it executes all of that uh work while remaining a device that doesn't need
[01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:46.840]  any electricity it flows by gravity alone and that's a very important factor for anybody who is
[01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:51.240]  thinking that they need a filter in an emergency an emergency you're not going to have any support
[01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:55.080]  you're going to have to have a filter that operates purely by gravity that will flow just
[01:20:55.080 --> 01:21:00.520]  naturally at high velocity to supply sufficient water for your needs and really can handle whatever
[01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:06.120]  is coming down the line in the way of microbiological threats chemical threats uh even uh you know
[01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:11.720]  wartime chemical threats so sure and i think all that's important but what about the entire water
[01:21:11.720 --> 01:21:17.080]  supply they admit even most well water has got hundreds of different chemicals in it i mean
[01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:22.680]  just the round up alone uh is something i don't want to be drinking yeah there's there's pesticides
[01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:29.320]  herbicide uh as you said mtbe which is a fuel additive uh breaking into people's wells because
[01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:34.120]  effectively these materials are just moving out into the environment more and more so even during
[01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:39.800]  peacetime uh you know the water that we get today unfortunately is going to be of poor quality
[01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:45.000]  and the quality is going to deteriorate into the future no question about it it's just building up
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:51.400]  and building up i mean you can pull the statistics up but all 50 states even alaska have contaminated
[01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:56.120]  groundwater uh i was reading where the fuel additive you mentioned is in 99 percent of
[01:21:56.120 --> 01:22:03.320]  water samples in north america i mean wow and that stuff is so carcinogenic yeah i mean it's not
[01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:08.440]  just that you know the average american especially a urban american is going to be using water that
[01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:13.720]  actually is reused respectively don't have fresh water you're getting water from the upstream
[01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:17.880]  person he's getting through a contaminated his contaminated water is going through treatment
[01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:22.760]  plants which are ineffective those those waters are flowing back and forth and back and forth back
[01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:28.520]  to you over and over again down down down through the system until they're very heavily contaminated
[01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:34.360]  so effectively a person in america is getting water that's been used four or five times before he's
[01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:39.320]  gotten it it's not fresh rainwater trust me and even fresh rainwater is picking up contaminants
[01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:44.120]  from the atmosphere today so sure what about bio accumulation too because we know in the ocean
[01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:48.680]  and the krill get eaten by the little fish and then the medium-sized fish and the big fish and
[01:22:48.680 --> 01:22:53.480]  the tuna and by the time you get up to the tuna they're just incredibly toxic not just mercury
[01:22:53.480 --> 01:22:59.080]  but other metals radioactive isotopes because it's bio accumulated literally as the rivers run down
[01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:03.960]  south it's well known they just get more and more and more and more contaminated and then
[01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:09.800]  somewhere like la where you're drinking toilet to tap and there's this myth that oh tap water's so
[01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:14.200]  good when you've been drinking high quality filtered water or even high quality bottled water
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:23.160]  you can't go back to tap water it tastes like grody crud well i mean look uh you know i did
[01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:28.760]  study years ago a river sediment in just rivers everywhere in america we took sediment out of
[01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:34.840]  those rivers and you put them into a very sensitive radiation detector you will see that fallout
[01:23:34.840 --> 01:23:41.000]  is everywhere on those river sediments you'll have cobalt 60 you'll have cc 137 these long lived
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:45.480]  radioactive isotopes are in the rivers they're not coming out they're going to be there for
[01:23:45.480 --> 01:23:50.280]  really the rest of our lives and that's from fallout from nuclear weapons and by the way i forgot
[01:23:50.840 --> 01:23:55.240]  i should have done my when i heard you were coming on next uh last week coming on next week
[01:23:55.800 --> 01:24:01.880]  i meant to pull up like the abc cbs nbc pieces from local news in texas uh on how radioactive
[01:24:01.880 --> 01:24:06.680]  the water is and they go but this isn't the radiation you'd find in limestone this is
[01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:12.280]  artificial and they didn't know why and then i forgot uh doing the research this is the first
[01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:18.680]  filter of this type correct that even reduces to near non-detectable levels radioactive isotopes
[01:24:18.680 --> 01:24:24.360]  that is such a ultra massive game changer because there's not just the unnatural radiation from
[01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:31.080]  testing fallout and plants uh there is also natural isotopes correct in many limestone
[01:24:31.080 --> 01:24:37.240]  deposits in fact there's a headline khou houston texas texas drinking water makes pipes and plumbing
[01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:43.960]  radioactive see i'm not joking folks how big a deal is natural and unnatural radioactive fallout
[01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:49.720]  in the water supply well the natural radioactive material is really pervasive because uranium is
[01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:56.680]  not as uh rare an element as you might expect uranium then breaks down into radium and radium
[01:24:56.680 --> 01:25:01.640]  breaks down into radon which then becomes a whole host of radioactive materials led to 10
[01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:09.240]  polonium etc all of those materials end up in especially well water and so these materials
[01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:14.520]  are coming up this filter is very effective in in intercepting those contaminants and
[01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:21.720]  actually i've had a an earlier filter that i used to sell for people's whole house that would remove
[01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:27.960]  radioactive material from the whole house environment those filters became so radioactive
[01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:32.680]  that one day i had the police come into my factory wow and so they said well we just
[01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:37.160]  interested one of your devices at our incinerator and shut down the whole thing because we have a
[01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:43.400]  radiation detector what is this and it turned out to be a filter from someone's home which had
[01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:48.680]  accumulated so much radioactivity that it actually shut down the municipal incinerator well that's
[01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:53.640]  what they were saying in these local newscasts because texas obviously as has so much natural but
[01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:59.320]  also unnatural in the edwards aquifer that it's setting off radiation detectors when they try
[01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:04.440]  to sell the scrap metal and stuff that's how the investigation in one town started was because the
[01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:08.680]  police and military got called in because they thought somebody was smuggling a dirty bomb
[01:26:08.680 --> 01:26:15.080]  well absolutely and you know people do not realize uh that 265 nuclear weapons were exploded in the
[01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:21.000]  atmosphere during the 1950s through the 1970s and all that radioactivity which is one of us
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:27.240]  good sized nuclear war is now in the atmosphere and has fallen down all over the earth and so
[01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:31.480]  all that radioactivity is going to have to be dealt with for the really really into the millennia
[01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:38.040]  into the future wow because that's something i've bemoaned on air i try to take iodine and try
[01:26:38.040 --> 01:26:41.640]  to get something out of my body but i've bemoaned that the radiation levels are almost three times
[01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:47.080]  what they were uh pre-manhattan project in the northern hemisphere because of all the testing
[01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:51.960]  and and i've bemoaned the fact that how do i get radioactive isotopes out of the water
[01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:55.640]  when there really aren't other filters that do it even really good ones that cut out fluoride
[01:26:55.640 --> 01:27:01.240]  and glyphosates and MBTA you know we sell those they're great this one do you know because i know
[01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:06.600]  there's hundreds of different isotopes really thousands but but but how can you say it reduces
[01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:13.160]  or stops the radioactive debris and explain to us doctor how that happens well i mean
[01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:19.080]  this is a complex filter it has a whole set of absorbance that target each of the individual
[01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:24.520]  contaminants let's just take one let's say radioactive iodine radioactive iodine is
[01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:29.000]  something that's produced let's say during a nuclear reactor accident or after a nuclear
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:35.640]  weapon goes off and it very very rapidly bio accumulates into the human body so you must be
[01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:41.160]  able to intercept it if you can and get and avoid it a radioactive iodine is very efficiently absorbed
[01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:46.440]  by activated carbon which is the baseline material within this filter so we basically
[01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:51.880]  remove radioactive iodine directly by absorption and it will it will be quantitatively removed
[01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:57.080]  by this kind of filter completely wow you know i've done my own research i'm not an engineer
[01:27:57.080 --> 01:28:02.200]  and a scientist like you but it's just crazy to know this is going on and the general public
[01:28:02.200 --> 01:28:06.840]  is not aware of it when i've done news pieces about radiation and most water supplies people
[01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:12.120]  think i'm making it up or when jacari jackson went out to the west coast and showed fish that were
[01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:17.800]  you know 30 40 times the normal level people went you just don't have that geiger counter
[01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:23.080]  calibrated rider or you don't have that field unit but then they sent the local newspapers out
[01:28:23.080 --> 01:28:28.040]  with the u.s military and they said no yeah we found areas 20 30 times what it's supposed to be but
[01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:34.360]  that's okay so there's this law's a fair attitude about it yeah it is i mean uh you know we actually
[01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:39.720]  uh you know radioactive radon is just everywhere in people's homes for example coming up through
[01:28:39.720 --> 01:28:46.200]  their water it's just in natural well water and so it's just everywhere around you and sometimes
[01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:51.720]  it could be at huge levels i remember i was doing a survey in massachusetts and uh there was a lady
[01:28:51.720 --> 01:28:56.120]  there who had a farm out in the way out you would think this is the most beautiful pristine area
[01:28:56.120 --> 01:29:01.000]  there's no way that she would have any exposure to any contaminants her well water was one of
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:05.240]  the most radioactive well waters we'd ever encountered it had hundreds of thousands of
[01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:10.520]  beaker curies of radon coming up through this well water unbelievable and you would think that she
[01:29:10.520 --> 01:29:15.320]  would be glowing and uh it was just remarkable she was sitting right on top of what was equivalent
[01:29:15.320 --> 01:29:19.560]  of a uranium mine but they're hyping terrorism you have a better chance of a honeybee killing you
[01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:22.840]  than terrorism and i'm not saying it isn't a threat but they act like it's the end of the world
[01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:28.200]  but then all this real stuff's going on and the average person isn't even aware of it 10 percent
[01:29:28.200 --> 01:29:34.280]  off a lexapure pro introductory offer and free shipping uh this is something i'm definitely
[01:29:34.280 --> 01:29:40.040]  going to be adding to my arsenal to protect my family uh this is a big deal they also have this
[01:29:40.040 --> 01:29:46.040]  is a remarkable filter alex i mean this will be uh it's the most complex sophisticated device
[01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:50.760]  really i've ever done stay there dr we're gonna come right back stay there amazing buyers on the
[01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:54.760]  run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:29:58.680 --> 01:30:02.920]  pillaby clinton will testify in front of the bangazi committee and of course she's going to
[01:30:02.920 --> 01:30:08.760]  try and spin this as just partisan politics but let's look at the facts they lied one of the first
[01:30:08.760 --> 01:30:14.520]  moves the obama administration made after the bangazi attack was to contact youtube in an apparent
[01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:19.640]  attempt to blame the attack on an obscure pastor john video this is according to state department
[01:30:19.640 --> 01:30:24.840]  documents obtained by judicial watch later the administration famously claimed the attack was
[01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:30.600]  provoked by another youtube video innocence of muslims made by an egyptian born filmmaker
[01:30:30.600 --> 01:30:36.280]  while they were plotting an enormous lie on the public former navy seal david uben was still trapped
[01:30:36.280 --> 01:30:42.280]  on the roof of the bangazi annex for 20 hours the obama administration later jailed the filmmaker
[01:30:42.280 --> 01:30:47.640]  behind innocence of muslims in fact he was the only man who's been captured and imprisoned in the
[01:30:47.640 --> 01:30:54.280]  aftermath of the bangazi terrorist attack what difference at this point does it make read more

[01:33:42.680 --> 01:33:49.000]  i was really talking about multiple messages here wonder i am an fm affiliates that if they will
[01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:55.560]  in my view not just go out and get sponsors but pick a few high quality products everybody needs
[01:33:55.560 --> 01:34:02.040]  educate them like water filtration systems and then sell those or have a deal through a shopping
[01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:10.040]  cart where they're drop ship from the factory that will end up being the game changer mpr gets
[01:34:10.040 --> 01:34:16.600]  taxpayer money 450 million a year and then it begs for money every month well i am an fm libertarian
[01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:22.040]  talk radio conservative radio can't do that and talk radio is dying in many areas of the country
[01:34:22.040 --> 01:34:26.840]  we're exploding because we innovate and so i really think ought to go around the country
[01:34:26.840 --> 01:34:33.400]  consulting with stations are making a video for free for affiliates on how to save talk radio
[01:34:33.400 --> 01:34:39.640]  because a lot of conservatives libertarians too are too prideful in a good way to go on air like
[01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:44.440]  socialists and say you need to buy our products or we won't be on air stations need to say hey
[01:34:44.440 --> 01:34:48.440]  we're reaching a lot of people with the truth but as you know there's a war on talk radio
[01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:53.480]  and you need to buy products from us i mean i would be happy if stations you know got in contact
[01:34:53.480 --> 01:34:58.600]  with a lexapur and red hawk and became distributors of it and i made no money i'd cut ads for our
[01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:03.640]  stations i'm actually doing that on young jevony other things and it's helped a lot of our affiliates
[01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:08.520]  i've got like i'm not exaggerating liners for like 50 stations i've been sitting on for a month
[01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:13.400]  on top all the other liners and i apologize uh that i'm supposed to cut and i don't do this very
[01:35:13.400 --> 01:35:18.200]  optimal once a month or so i'll just communicate right to our stations right to the program directors
[01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:23.320]  right to the station owners and just say i know the boat you're in and we thank you for picking up
[01:35:23.320 --> 01:35:29.000]  the show it's not enough that we bring ratings the station needs to be profitable to keep the lights on
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:33.720]  and as free marketers we're having our free market shut down because the globalists can't
[01:35:33.720 --> 01:35:37.960]  compete with our ideas we're winning so they're coming after talk radio they're coming after
[01:35:37.960 --> 01:35:42.600]  free speech they're coming after drudge ted cruz is warned of that members of congress have
[01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:47.560]  they're coming matt drudge came here two weeks ago to be in studio with us to warn folks so
[01:35:47.560 --> 01:35:54.040]  so i am proud to get up here once a week or every two weeks and do 20 30 minutes and and say hey

[01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:42.680]  uh also written over 100 peer reviewed papers uh 30 patents and as the originator of the solid
[01:37:42.680 --> 01:37:47.560]  state extrusion process that everybody uses dr causlove holds a bachelor's degree in engineering
[01:37:47.560 --> 01:37:53.640]  a master's degree in forestry from yale university and a doctorate in agronomy and i'm
[01:37:53.640 --> 01:37:56.120]  pronounced that right i don't even know what that is i think i know everything i don't
[01:37:56.120 --> 01:37:59.640]  an agricultural engineering from cornell university tell us tell us what that particular
[01:37:59.640 --> 01:38:03.880]  degree of all your doctorates is and then spend five more minutes i can't wait to fly out to where
[01:38:03.880 --> 01:38:09.320]  you're at and interview there in person and see your laboratory and really i've talked to folks
[01:38:09.320 --> 01:38:14.280]  that have been there they say it's it's really high tech uh but uh what's that particular degree
[01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:20.680]  what is that about well okay so i had um i have a hardcore engineering degree from yale and then
[01:38:20.680 --> 01:38:26.600]  i basically went into uh two software degrees which one was in forestry one and is an agriculture
[01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:32.360]  i actually own a farm in vermont so i actually uh uh practice what i preach a little bit on my
[01:38:32.360 --> 01:38:38.120]  education but actually um much of my work was on from the very beginning on the purification of
[01:38:38.120 --> 01:38:43.560]  air and water and uh so i've worked in that field pretty much since i was a young person
[01:38:43.560 --> 01:38:49.720]  emerging from school and uh i worked on projects ranging from uh a filtration of uh
[01:38:49.720 --> 01:38:56.200]  filled air going into armored fighting vehicles uh to uh comanche helicopter uh every kind of
[01:38:56.200 --> 01:39:00.920]  a military project all the way down to consumer products and they all have a common theme which
[01:39:00.920 --> 01:39:05.320]  is uh we're all trying to remove contaminants sometimes purposely placed into the atmosphere
[01:39:05.320 --> 01:39:10.200]  or into the water and sometimes just emerging from the natural environment and are very very
[01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:16.600]  dangerous and we need to control them so you know that's that's pretty much what i've done in my
[01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:21.560]  entire life uh but the mixed degrees actually do make sense when you look at well absolutely
[01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:28.840]  gives you a wide spectrum of knowledge break down why you're so proud of these filters well i mean
[01:39:28.840 --> 01:39:35.160]  this this the Alexa purer is really a culmination of all of my experience it was posed to me as
[01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:40.840]  an extremely challenging uh project uh they wanted a product that would actually operate
[01:39:40.840 --> 01:39:46.280]  without any electricity so you had no pressure you had to do it all by gravity and they needed
[01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:53.080]  they really effectively said we need everything imaginable to be removed efficiently way higher
[01:39:53.080 --> 01:39:59.400]  than 99 percent and so the result was it was it's a extreme challenge uh worked on it uh
[01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:05.960]  for quite a long time and basically what we've done is we created a the only filter to my knowledge
[01:40:05.960 --> 01:40:14.680]  that hits all three it will remove effectively all the major uh metals uh all the major non-metals
[01:40:14.680 --> 01:40:20.760]  such as fluoride it will take out uh all known microbiological threats including viral bacterial
[01:40:20.760 --> 01:40:28.120]  and zest and it will take out uh organic chemicals of pretty much everything with without exception
[01:40:28.120 --> 01:40:33.160]  it's a very very powerful device i don't believe that there's anything else out there in the world
[01:40:33.160 --> 01:40:39.800]  that can do that especially under gravity flow conditions well just the stainless steel manufacturing
[01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:46.120]  is excellent as well and the whole thing is just top of the line and very very affordable compared
[01:40:46.120 --> 01:40:53.000]  to leading competitors yeah i mean it the fit and finish are fantastic um it you know it's uh uh
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:57.720]  the stainless steel you know indicates you know how electric piers really worked hard to uh have
[01:40:57.720 --> 01:41:04.760]  compromised at no no compromise was made on the quality of the uh construction um so i mean it's
[01:41:04.760 --> 01:41:09.880]  really a remarkable achievement on their part and i feel very proud actually to be part of the team
[01:41:09.880 --> 01:41:16.360]  that put that together well doctor i appreciate all your time today looking at a couple articles on
[01:41:16.360 --> 01:41:23.800]  fluoride here's a headline feds black suffer most from fluoride but fluoridate anyways
[01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:28.520]  and another article here on the hovenham post harvard study confirms fluoride reduces children's
[01:41:28.520 --> 01:41:34.280]  IQ this isn't calcium fluoride that you've got to have a little bit of from what i've read
[01:41:34.280 --> 01:41:41.080]  this is hydrofluorosalic acid uh what's your view overall on fluoride well okay so we actually tested
[01:41:41.080 --> 01:41:45.880]  against both the fluoride ion and the fluorosilicate that you mentioned which is the additive that
[01:41:45.880 --> 01:41:52.120]  people put into water uh under federal control and basically uh we remove both them with equal
[01:41:52.120 --> 01:41:57.880]  efficiency so we wanted to be sure that no matter how fluoride is added to the water can be intercepted
[01:41:57.880 --> 01:42:04.040]  and removed um so that's how we've dealt with that i mean look fluoride is uh you do need small
[01:42:04.040 --> 01:42:10.040]  amounts but the amounts that are added supplementally i have been always a big controversy uh for
[01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:17.720]  people's health uh i mean it's it's been something has been done since the 1950s and uh the the
[01:42:17.720 --> 01:42:22.760]  research is completely unclear about uh you know whether it should be done or shouldn't be done uh
[01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:27.960]  it for uh basically preventing cavities they're effectively uh impacting the rest of your health
[01:42:27.960 --> 01:42:32.840]  so i all i can tell you is that we tested against all known fluoride chemicals that are added to
[01:42:32.840 --> 01:42:37.560]  water the new ones and the old ones and we remove them all of equal efficiency
[01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:43.160]  and it's your belief that this is the best gravity-fed filter of the design out there
[01:42:43.160 --> 01:42:48.440]  available to the public without a doubt i mean most of these gravity flow filters are at best
[01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:55.560]  uh simple particulate filters they remove dirt and debris sediment they're not going to be capable
[01:42:55.560 --> 01:43:00.280]  intercepting a viral particle uh to the degree we're talking quantitative reduction below
[01:43:00.280 --> 01:43:07.320]  detection so no one can touch that kind of capability well i'm impressed and i want to
[01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:14.840]  thank you so much for your time today it is the alexa pure pro family of water filtration systems

[01:45:04.120 --> 01:45:09.240]  for stevens was responsible for his own security we've got a whole bunch of these clips i want to
[01:45:09.240 --> 01:45:13.240]  go through this is what we've been culling through as she's been testifying now for several hours
[01:45:13.240 --> 01:45:20.200]  mengozzi hearing hillary clinton ignored 600 requests for more security in libya and then of
[01:45:20.200 --> 01:45:25.720]  course her response is is that stevens uh was basically responsible no stevens didn't run the
[01:45:25.720 --> 01:45:30.520]  mengozzi security it was a security force that came over that the al-qaeda folks that
[01:45:31.080 --> 01:45:37.400]  hair clinton was running that did the attacking and this all came out a long time ago everything
[01:45:37.400 --> 01:45:42.280]  i mean i'm getting all these emails from mainstream media and famous people and text messages nice
[01:45:42.280 --> 01:45:46.120]  folks going i was watching fox news and they admitted it was an arms deal and it was the ship
[01:45:46.120 --> 01:45:51.320]  to al-qaeda in syria and that they knew he was going to be killed and it may have been a hit and
[01:45:51.320 --> 01:45:58.280]  i can't believe it's on the news and that's because folks know and i'm glad this is all coming out
[01:45:58.280 --> 01:46:03.880]  because it makes me a lot safer it was not fun when they killed those navy seals that were on the
[01:46:03.880 --> 01:46:08.120]  bin laden raid a few months after to talk to the families and then i had the families on
[01:46:08.120 --> 01:46:17.400]  that with others in private and it's not it's scary to meet with navy seals mother and father and
[01:46:19.640 --> 01:46:25.480]  it's scary to then meet with another navy seal that was trends with one of the guys that got
[01:46:25.480 --> 01:46:30.520]  blown up and talked to some of the people on the ground they said we think it's a trap it's
[01:46:30.520 --> 01:46:34.360]  weird we're being put on this weird old helicopter this isn't a real mission and they just blew them
[01:46:34.360 --> 01:46:41.480]  up and they know the government killed them and then i remember after that meeting i stopped on
[01:46:41.480 --> 01:46:47.240]  the side of the highway and shot a youtube video and uploaded it and i was i wasn't shaking but i was
[01:46:47.240 --> 01:46:54.040]  i was hired in a kite i felt like i had 20 cups of coffee it felt like the three times i used
[01:46:54.040 --> 01:46:59.800]  methamphetamine in high school where i was just so awake it was just horrible i mean you learn this
[01:46:59.800 --> 01:47:04.840]  type of stuff you get chills up your spine you get nauseous you're totally wired and you just want to
[01:47:04.840 --> 01:47:10.360]  warn everybody because you want to get it out and you know you can get killed doing this and when
[01:47:10.360 --> 01:47:16.600]  you're in danger is when the info is not known so thank my lucky stars and for all your prayers
[01:47:16.600 --> 01:47:21.720]  and good lord above i'm still not pushing daisies my kids really need me my family needs me i'm not
[01:47:21.720 --> 01:47:27.000]  afraid of dying and i sometimes i go well you better be you got family counting on you it's
[01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:32.280]  kind of a sick thing to just give in to not being scared and just go i don't care just go to events
[01:47:32.280 --> 01:47:37.960]  with no security just walk around not caring and i'm still like that and people look at me and i'm
[01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:42.360]  not bragging it's my own it's actually a problem i have people go man you're not scared but what's
[01:47:42.360 --> 01:47:49.320]  wrong with you i just i just i'm just not scared i'm scared of failing i'm i don't want to look
[01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:58.840]  at hillary as president i i mean i just i just i just can't handle i don't know what i'm talking
[01:47:58.840 --> 01:48:04.840]  about anymore i don't want to be the one talking to navy seals on and off air i don't want to be the
[01:48:04.840 --> 01:48:08.600]  one breaking all this stuff i don't want to be the one with the Benghazi whistleblowers on first
[01:48:10.120 --> 01:48:15.400]  and then of course get no credit for it because the system hates me so much fine the problem is
[01:48:15.400 --> 01:48:20.680]  those that i don't want to get credit for it with i get the credit i mean you know the globalists know
[01:48:20.680 --> 01:48:26.760]  where so much of the resistance comes from is this platform and i'm not bragging i don't feel worthy

[01:49:15.720 --> 01:49:20.840]  august and then in that weekend a few days before the attacks you know there were a number of them
[01:49:20.840 --> 01:49:27.800]  i know that yes ma'am 83 by our count that's over 600 requests you've testified here this morning that
[01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:33.160]  you had none of those reached your desk is that correct that's correct by the secretary mr bloometh
[01:49:33.160 --> 01:49:37.880]  i'll wrote you 150 emails it appears from the testimony or the materials that we've read that

[01:49:53.880 --> 01:49:59.160]  but a man who was a friend of yours who'd never been to libya didn't know much about it at least
[01:49:59.160 --> 01:50:04.680]  that's his testimony didn't know much about it every one of those reports that he sent on to
[01:50:04.680 --> 01:50:09.880]  you that had to do with situations on the ground in libya those made it to your desk you asked for
[01:50:09.880 --> 01:50:15.480]  more of them you read them you corresponded with him and yet the folks that worked for you didn't
[01:50:15.480 --> 01:50:21.880]  have the same courtesy well congressman uh as uh as is aware as you're aware he's a friend of mine
[01:50:21.880 --> 01:50:28.760]  he sent me information he thought might be of interest so it's really hard to look at her but

[01:54:36.760 --> 01:54:42.040]  see what's happening live a little bit here's hillary clinton saying chris stevens didn't
[01:54:42.040 --> 01:54:48.440]  have her personal email address and then it just continues on here it is follow up on one thing
[01:54:48.440 --> 01:54:55.000]  about ambassador stevens you've got a lot of emails from sydney bloomington and you say that
[01:54:55.000 --> 01:55:01.960]  mr bloomington was a friend of yours and he had your personal email address you say chris stevens
[01:55:01.960 --> 01:55:10.840]  was a friend of yours he asked numerous of times for extra protection now if i had been
[01:55:10.840 --> 01:55:16.520]  mr stevens and i think anybody out there anybody watching this would agree if i had been mr
[01:55:16.520 --> 01:55:23.960]  stevens and i'd had a relationship with you and i had requested 20 or more times for additional
[01:55:23.960 --> 01:55:30.600]  security to protect not only my life but the people that were there with me i would have
[01:55:30.600 --> 01:55:36.680]  gotten in touch with you some way to area i would have let you know that i was in danger
[01:55:36.680 --> 01:55:44.440]  and it's a situation had deteriorated to a point i needed you to do something did he didn't have
[01:55:44.440 --> 01:55:53.080]  your personal email congressman i i can't look at i do not believe that he had my personal email
[01:55:53.080 --> 01:55:59.880]  he had the email and he had a chipmunk i'm to everybody that he'd worked with four years
[01:55:59.880 --> 01:56:04.760]  he had been posted with officials in the state department they had gone through
[01:56:05.480 --> 01:56:12.200]  difficult challenging dangerous assignments together he was in constant uh contact with people
[01:56:13.160 --> 01:56:21.000]  yes he and the people working for him asked for more security some of those requests were approved
[01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:26.760]  others were not you're so arrogant we're obviously looking to learn what more we could show in
[01:56:26.760 --> 01:56:32.200]  titles um because it was not only about Benghazi it was also about the embassy in triple they stack
[01:56:32.200 --> 01:56:39.000]  all these women behind her that work for her that uh it's about women asked for what he and his people
[01:56:40.360 --> 01:56:45.160]  requested because i saw an article yes i forget by who it was mainstream media i think it was time
[01:56:45.160 --> 01:56:51.880]  magazine and it was the women of hillary how her press corps is almost entirely women and they support
[01:56:51.880 --> 01:56:59.080]  her well they're the press because they're women and they follow her i mean what a gimmick i mean
[01:56:59.080 --> 01:57:05.240]  i can't imagine like i'm gonna support this guy because he's a guy doesn't matter all the horrible
[01:57:05.240 --> 01:57:12.040]  things she's done what she stands for she's a woman so women think hey i'm getting ahead there's a
[01:57:12.040 --> 01:57:17.960]  woman in there i'm gonna vote for obama because i'm black and he's black i'm gonna get ahead if you
[01:57:17.960 --> 01:57:24.840]  take that same measurement black unemployment doubled only went up like what ten percent or less
[01:57:25.400 --> 01:57:32.120]  in in other quote populations but blacks it doubled doubled doubled in fact didn't even go up 10
[01:57:32.120 --> 01:57:38.840]  percent like eight percent i think maybe black unemployment doubled
[01:57:38.840 --> 01:57:48.360]  but is it like 18 percent or something now was like 15 percent before that it was like seven percent
[01:57:51.480 --> 01:57:55.560]  but it doesn't matter you see because it's fantasy land she says she likes women
[01:57:58.360 --> 01:58:02.280]  i mean i mean it's creepy i don't get a period attack lesbians or anything like that
[01:58:03.560 --> 01:58:07.960]  i'm a libertarian but i am a christian at the same time but it is creepy to have an old man
[01:58:07.960 --> 01:58:12.520]  going and picking on you know and grabbing on hot women at the office especially if they don't like it
[01:58:13.720 --> 01:58:16.920]  but man it's really creepy when it's hillary clinton a little old lady outfit
[01:58:17.880 --> 01:58:22.440]  pure portally let's like multiple women per day i mean it's it's just season really gross
[01:58:24.360 --> 01:58:30.040]  it's all about her power and all about her will and just and she's not even strong but we lay down

[02:00:04.840 --> 02:00:12.120]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[02:00:12.120 --> 02:00:24.760]  he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[02:00:30.840 --> 02:00:35.480]  well there's another reason i'm getting robert kiyosaki on with us on this friday edition
[02:00:36.440 --> 02:00:39.640]  he's written two books with donald trump he's good friends with him
[02:00:39.640 --> 02:00:44.600]  and i really want to know if donald trump's for real i know robert kiyosaki's for real
[02:00:46.200 --> 02:00:52.200]  and i want to get his take on donald trump the election ben gazi and the economy as well robert
[02:00:52.200 --> 02:00:58.280]  kiyosaki has been really accurate in a lot of his predictions about where where the economy is going
[02:00:58.280 --> 02:01:03.080]  and what the corporations are doing that's all coming up we're continuing to monitor in fact
[02:01:03.080 --> 02:01:07.160]  we go with that live feeder in a moment we're continuing to monitor the whole hillary ben
[02:01:07.160 --> 02:01:13.160]  gazi thing and it's a bunch of softball with her just lying and oh they had 600 requests but i
[02:01:13.160 --> 02:01:19.480]  didn't ever really see it or we did some of them or oh no stevens never talked to me so they've
[02:01:19.480 --> 02:01:23.400]  they've taken a break right now they've got a press conference going let's cut to that
[02:01:26.760 --> 02:01:33.400]  and there and there are additional documents that we will have the opportunity in the next
[02:01:33.400 --> 02:01:39.000]  few hours to ask her about that she has not been asked about in previous hearings so
[02:01:40.440 --> 02:01:45.720]  last question why shouldn't the full transcript of city boom with all testimony
[02:01:46.760 --> 02:01:51.720]  look i think these these large discussions about what is released and what isn't released
[02:01:51.720 --> 02:01:56.840]  need to be made in the totality of the whole investigation so as the chairman has said
[02:01:56.840 --> 02:02:01.800]  50 witnesses have been interviewed there's probably 20 more than that's enough so we're
[02:02:01.800 --> 02:02:07.080]  they've threatened the witnesses the truth's been covered up i've talked to the whistleblowers the
[02:02:07.080 --> 02:02:13.080]  nato people the pentagon people the navy seals all of it everything we told you years ago when
[02:02:13.080 --> 02:02:18.360]  this happened has now been confirmed and it's not hard i mean everybody knows what happened
[02:02:18.360 --> 02:02:23.800]  they sat there on on board a bunch of aircraft carriers and satellites with drones overhead for
[02:02:23.800 --> 02:02:28.360]  seven and a half hours they had a drone over that thing within 30 minutes of the attack attack
[02:02:28.360 --> 02:02:32.920]  it taking place the attack launching
[02:02:35.800 --> 02:02:42.360]  and they just think we are absolute complete and total buffoon morons
[02:02:46.760 --> 02:02:54.040]  coming up i want to get into a very important article out of gallop majority say more concealed
[02:02:54.040 --> 02:03:03.880]  weapons would make us safer now from what i've seen in in local polls other national polls
[02:03:03.880 --> 02:03:10.440]  and police polls 98% of police are pro second amendment national polls i'm not defending
[02:03:10.440 --> 02:03:15.320]  some of the bad police out there i'm just stating this is not our natural enemy is the police
[02:03:15.320 --> 02:03:20.440]  as patriots we need to take our local police back not let the globalists take them over there's a
[02:03:20.440 --> 02:03:27.560]  fight right now but i digress 56% believe that if more americans carry concealed weapons after
[02:03:27.560 --> 02:03:32.760]  passing a criminal background check and training course the country would be safer now that's gallop
[02:03:32.760 --> 02:03:36.920]  that targets specific type people that still have phone lines and stuff and that's still
[02:03:36.920 --> 02:03:43.000]  by the paradigm it's probably more like 70% from what i've seen but still the numbers from a decade
[02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:49.640]  ago it was something like 30% and and they go over that in the article whether it's guns or
[02:03:49.640 --> 02:03:54.200]  abortion we're winning the hearts and minds and that ties into this sickening article out of the
[02:03:54.200 --> 02:04:02.120]  washington post the nra will fall it's inevitable just look at the demographics and they say we're
[02:04:02.120 --> 02:04:09.880]  bringing in all these illegals they actually say and and so they vote 75% of the time quote new you
[02:04:09.880 --> 02:04:15.960]  know new latinos to america they don't call them illegals but but that's only at first and that's
[02:04:15.960 --> 02:04:22.120]  only who they're talking to i mean do you really think the average illegal who just left a country
[02:04:22.120 --> 02:04:26.840]  where they can't own guns doesn't want a gun the illegals have all got guns fine most of them aren't
[02:04:26.840 --> 02:04:30.840]  criminals they're protecting their families i don't want anybody having a gun taken if you got out
[02:04:30.840 --> 02:04:36.600]  of prison for bank robbery and you were arrested with your legal revolver give it to you until 1968
[02:04:36.600 --> 02:04:43.400]  they did when you got out of prison if you here's your here's your gun billy because people were
[02:04:43.400 --> 02:04:47.800]  like well yeah he served his time he should be able to have a gun he gets in trouble with it again
[02:04:47.800 --> 02:04:53.800]  people say he'll just get a gun anyways why are you gonna take it served your time did your time
[02:04:53.800 --> 02:04:57.080]  did your time did your time did your time did your time
[02:04:59.480 --> 02:05:04.200]  less than a week after the overnight upgrade to tesla cars making them capable of autonomous
[02:05:04.200 --> 02:05:10.120]  driving multiple videos have surfaced of the cars trying to throw their human drivers under the bus
[02:05:10.120 --> 02:05:15.800]  literally in one video the car begins beeping as another car approaches then rapidly swerves into
[02:05:15.800 --> 02:05:20.360]  what would have been a head-on collision if the driver hadn't reacted quickly to jerk the wheel
[02:05:20.360 --> 02:05:26.760]  back to the right tesla says auto steers just a beta release if you use it and your car crashes
[02:05:26.760 --> 02:05:31.800]  they deny all responsibility releasing buggy software that causes your computer to crash
[02:05:31.800 --> 02:05:37.400]  is far different than releasing buggy software that can crash your car with you in it and kill
[02:05:37.400 --> 02:05:42.440]  other people on the highway and ask yourself why would the government that normally is fanatic
[02:05:42.440 --> 02:05:48.920]  about safety allow this on the road because nothing is more important for them than to get
[02:05:48.920 --> 02:05:54.440]  control of your transportation even if it means a few of us will be smashed like bugs while they

[02:08:17.720 --> 02:08:25.800]  of readers around the world over 100 million books plus in print rich dad dot com robert
[02:08:25.800 --> 02:08:31.560]  kiyosaki is our guest here for the next 52 minutes and one big reason i was really excited
[02:08:31.560 --> 02:08:36.360]  that we could get him for the show he's a busy guy entrepreneur owns mines around the world you
[02:08:36.360 --> 02:08:43.720]  name it factories hires tons of people you know a true builder he's also good friends with donald
[02:08:43.720 --> 02:08:49.560]  trump and they've written two books together and so i really want to know is donald trump for real
[02:08:49.560 --> 02:08:53.880]  i like what he has to say i don't think he wants to destroy the country i don't think he's a
[02:08:53.880 --> 02:08:57.880]  kleptocrat i don't think he's one of these clowered and piven people like hillary clinton
[02:08:58.680 --> 02:09:03.080]  but he did make statements like he likes hillary clinton years ago well i don't know how you can
[02:09:03.080 --> 02:09:09.560]  like hillary clinton so so so i hope he's grown i hope he is the conservative libertarian he says
[02:09:09.560 --> 02:09:15.880]  he is and so out of the gates robert has agreed with us springing this on him to give us his take
[02:09:15.880 --> 02:09:20.200]  on donald trump election 2016 and where this country's going we'll look at the economy
[02:09:21.320 --> 02:09:27.320]  and get kiyosaki's take on that we'll also get his take on political correctness i mean
[02:09:28.120 --> 02:09:36.040]  it is getting wild where just pc police label thomas jefferson statue racist sexist and want
[02:09:36.040 --> 02:09:42.440]  it taken down he tried to get rid of slavery in the first uh constitution they wouldn't let him
[02:09:43.560 --> 02:09:51.960]  he did he was given slaves by his plantation family who he basically had free and who he basically
[02:09:51.960 --> 02:09:56.120]  you know like it was bad that he was in love with one lady it was basically his wife
[02:09:57.080 --> 02:10:00.680]  the point is is that he was the opposite of a racist but you got to think about
[02:10:00.680 --> 02:10:06.680]  the time they were living in it was the western world that began to phase out slavery and the
[02:10:06.680 --> 02:10:14.760]  whole caste system so talk about history twisted or history upside down where is the establishment
[02:10:14.760 --> 02:10:20.520]  going with that and i know i'm just springing wild cards on robert kiyosaki rich dad dot com
[02:10:21.320 --> 02:10:26.920]  and he's uh now has a new book out eight lessons in a military leadership for entrepreneurs and
[02:10:26.920 --> 02:10:33.000]  others and he joins us wow mr kiyosaki good to have you with us now that's how you're doing
[02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:38.360]  my friend good you're looking good you lost a lot of weight oh thank you well it's not that you
[02:10:38.360 --> 02:10:43.400]  needed to lose weight or anything but you look like you lost some weight now my my jeans are talking
[02:10:43.400 --> 02:10:48.440]  at the gut right now that's what i'm saying thank you okay well maybe it's the maybe it's the camera
[02:10:48.440 --> 02:10:53.640]  but uh great to have you with us okay let's talk donald trump i just threw out five or six topics
[02:10:53.640 --> 02:10:59.000]  what do you want to tackle first well trump is a great man uh we've been two books together
[02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:04.680]  i've known him now for about 12 years i'm actually much closer to his two sons who are great young
[02:11:04.680 --> 02:11:11.560]  men and um the daughter's pretty hot too as you know but donald's a great guy and the reason
[02:11:11.560 --> 02:11:18.840]  that he's friends with hillary is as we all know she can be bought that's right so he's being honest
[02:11:18.840 --> 02:11:25.160]  with people she has a price you know most politicians have a price which is the problem
[02:11:26.840 --> 02:11:31.640]  and folks said man that's really corrupt of him to be honest no under the legal system
[02:11:32.520 --> 02:11:37.000]  what's corrupt is you've got to buy hillary or she'll get in the way of your businesses it's not
[02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:43.960]  like he wants to buy her she makes you buy her correct well that's correct but donald also knows
[02:11:43.960 --> 02:11:49.640]  the game and he's pretty upfront about it you know he says i know all of these politicians up here
[02:11:49.640 --> 02:11:56.280]  i've given them all money that's probably true i mean i have no proof of it but as we know politicians
[02:11:56.280 --> 02:12:01.720]  cannot run without money and the bigger your war chest you know that's why biden had to drop out
[02:12:01.720 --> 02:12:07.240]  his hillary's war chest is so big biden could never catch up to it so the presidency and our
[02:12:07.240 --> 02:12:14.040]  senators and our congressmen can be bought that's our problem today all right well let me ask you
[02:12:14.040 --> 02:12:21.480]  this then how would you fix it how do you think donald would fix it and then specifically let's
[02:12:21.480 --> 02:12:28.600]  walk into this campaign and give us your view on it well donald can't be bought that's you know and
[02:12:28.600 --> 02:12:33.480]  when you look at all the candidates you know i'm not republican or democrat so i don't have a dog
[02:12:33.480 --> 02:12:39.800]  in that fight and when i vote i generally vote for the best person for the job and when you look at
[02:12:39.800 --> 02:12:44.440]  the world economy you look at the war in the middle east you look at china and all that
[02:12:45.960 --> 02:12:51.480]  which person of all the candidates including bernie sanders hillary and the rest of the republicans
[02:12:51.480 --> 02:12:57.240]  which one has the experience but more important you know my jewish friends say the hutzpah the
[02:12:57.240 --> 02:13:03.880]  horsepower to take them on and right now you know i'm from hawaii obama's from hawaii very smart guy
[02:13:04.520 --> 02:13:09.400]  nice leader but he's not a powerful leader so we're getting walked on all over the world
[02:13:10.200 --> 02:13:17.240]  and when you have a weak leader you know there's two types of leadership one is tyranny and what's
[02:13:17.240 --> 02:13:25.560]  his name and bagdad was a tyrant now if you're a weak leader you have anarchy today we have anarchy
[02:13:25.560 --> 02:13:31.640]  all over the middle east that's more dangerous than a tyrant and a lot of it when i look at
[02:13:31.640 --> 02:13:37.800]  our leadership and i do include bush george bush and this whole thing we've had weak leaders and
[02:13:37.800 --> 02:13:44.120]  we're now in anarchy all over the world and i'm afraid about this country as the you know the
[02:13:44.120 --> 02:13:49.800]  gap between the rich and the poor gets wider and wider what would kiyosaki do if you were president
[02:13:49.800 --> 02:13:56.040]  within the confines of the constitution a b if you were a dictator for one year what would you do i'd
[02:13:56.040 --> 02:14:02.680]  resign yeah exactly i went to college i'm not that stupid but you know i think trump said it best
[02:14:02.680 --> 02:14:08.440]  the other day he would bomb right now when you look at what's going on with isis they don't respond to
[02:14:08.440 --> 02:14:16.680]  nice people you know what obama is a soft power guy and soft power went out around 1990 and today
[02:14:16.680 --> 02:14:21.880]  the only way what they listen to i'm a former marine pilot so i speak from that that point of
[02:14:21.880 --> 02:14:28.360]  view you flew uh helicopters didn't you cubris yeah in vietnam wow and so do you wear the black
[02:14:28.360 --> 02:14:33.800]  stetson and everything no no no that was army i'm marine that's right yeah marine court i'd be
[02:14:33.800 --> 02:14:42.840]  court martial for wearing an army i'm sorry go ahead but anyway i i think we have to respond
[02:14:42.840 --> 02:14:48.680]  for us with force as much as i detested you know as much as i mean they they knocked trump two
[02:14:48.680 --> 02:14:53.080]  months ago saying bomb the hell out of isis take over their oil fields blow them up that'll cut
[02:14:53.080 --> 02:14:57.240]  their money off we can fix them in just a couple weeks which is totally true that's a no brainer
[02:14:57.240 --> 02:15:01.480]  and i'm not even a military tactician that's what you would do that's what the generals were saying
[02:15:01.480 --> 02:15:06.040]  they went oh you're an idiot then we wait putin comes in and makes obama look like a complete
[02:15:06.040 --> 02:15:10.840]  moron and now they're saying rush is the new moral center of the world i mean wow you talk about a
[02:15:10.840 --> 02:15:17.720]  disaster that's what i mean between tyrants and anarchy when you have a tyrant at least i think
[02:15:17.720 --> 02:15:23.400]  right now we need a tyrant and donald's not that donnell is a tyrant but he's closer to a tyrant
[02:15:23.400 --> 02:15:29.320]  than let's say carson you know we don't need burn surgeons right now we need somebody who's a strong
[02:15:29.320 --> 02:15:35.640]  leader otherwise his anarchy will spread so i could go ron paul was on yesterday and he said he's
[02:15:35.640 --> 02:15:41.480]  worried about trump being on a white horse and i could certainly see that uh but overall at least
[02:15:41.480 --> 02:15:47.400]  he would be into wanting to build something and be great himself instead of getting off on compromise
[02:15:47.400 --> 02:15:51.640]  and selling the country out i mean do you think in your gut trump could ever become a dictator if
[02:15:51.640 --> 02:15:58.200]  he was elected i don't think so you know you said to me he's more libertarian i've known him for 12
[02:15:58.200 --> 02:16:06.840]  years you know he says in in the close confines of private meetings you know he says we should provide
[02:16:06.840 --> 02:16:13.400]  medical care for all children you know and that's pretty liberal he says because we either pay for
[02:16:13.400 --> 02:16:18.520]  it now or we pay for it later with bad health sure and he and he also believes in financial
[02:16:18.520 --> 02:16:23.400]  education you know he you know he and i have had great financial education you're involved with
[02:16:23.400 --> 02:16:28.680]  his school aren't you he has old school strategies folks i do that yeah but we've got to bring financial
[02:16:28.680 --> 02:16:34.200]  education into our school systems but the socialists think that the love of money is the root of all
[02:16:34.200 --> 02:16:39.480]  evil and they'll never teach kids about money which is why we have ferguson and all these
[02:16:39.480 --> 02:16:44.920]  insanity going on in poverty with poverty in america see money doesn't discriminate you know
[02:16:44.920 --> 02:16:50.840]  money doesn't care if you're white yellow green pink blue money goes to people who are smart with
[02:16:50.840 --> 02:16:56.120]  money and then it talks yes money talks and i said i heard it once said goodbye
[02:16:59.320 --> 02:17:03.880]  so anyway i you know he stands for financial education which is why we wrote our two books
[02:17:03.880 --> 02:17:10.040]  together and you know he went to new york military school i went to a military school in new york so
[02:17:10.040 --> 02:17:15.560]  we have that discipline and a lot of people lack discipline as you know and then we pay
[02:17:15.560 --> 02:17:21.080]  our money to be on discipline that doesn't make any sense to me but for the socialist politicians
[02:17:21.080 --> 02:17:27.480]  they want dependence so they can control and so hence that's why overall i think libertarianism
[02:17:27.480 --> 02:17:31.400]  is winning intellectually but that's what the people that think are do you ever get concerned
[02:17:31.400 --> 02:17:36.360]  about the giant unwashed masses that more and more are being filled with social envy and hatred
[02:17:37.960 --> 02:17:43.080]  every day i mean that's why you know people say why do you keep or if you're a rich man why do you
[02:17:43.080 --> 02:17:49.240]  keep working because there's things that are more important than money and we're in a crisis today
[02:17:49.240 --> 02:17:55.480]  and that's why i think the man who can handle this crisis us as well as globally is donald trump
[02:17:55.480 --> 02:17:58.680]  i want to talk more about stuff you've talked about privately that doesn't break any confidence
[02:17:58.680 --> 02:18:02.600]  that means a lot to me because i've been reading your books for 20 years since my dad gave me one
[02:18:02.600 --> 02:18:08.200]  and i know you're a respected guy and very moral so so that means a lot to me uh you that that you're
[02:18:08.200 --> 02:18:13.720]  saying trump's the real deal but i get what you're saying i've only got like 49 employees and five or
[02:18:13.720 --> 02:18:18.440]  six contractors but sometimes i want to downsize and it's like no i'm not going to let them shut
[02:18:18.440 --> 02:18:24.360]  me down i'm not going to let them break me i want free market to win i want my crew to be well paid
[02:18:24.360 --> 02:18:30.600]  and be happy i want to have good products i want to be successful i just it becomes a fight doesn't
[02:18:30.600 --> 02:18:35.720]  it that you literally want to build a bigger company to literally help people you don't want
[02:18:35.720 --> 02:18:41.720]  to give up well there's a there's a book new book called the end of power you know in zuckerberg
[02:18:41.720 --> 02:18:47.480]  recommend every entrepreneur read the book end of power and it's a fantastic book and he says what's
[02:18:47.480 --> 02:18:53.880]  happening is the revolts in uh let's say the middle east and all over the world today are not from
[02:18:53.880 --> 02:19:00.680]  poor people the revolts are from educated young people who don't have you know a quote on called
[02:19:00.680 --> 02:19:06.600]  the american dream or the arab dream or whatever it is they just want a chance at life and i educate
[02:19:06.600 --> 02:19:11.640]  my point of view and donnell's point of view is we have to have financial education rather than
[02:19:11.640 --> 02:19:16.840]  financial welfare you know and most of these school teachers they hate to say this are good
[02:19:16.840 --> 02:19:21.720]  people but they're communists you know a communist believes that the government should control
[02:19:22.360 --> 02:19:29.400]  our education and our economy i fight that i went to war against communism but i came home i
[02:19:29.400 --> 02:19:34.840]  found more communist back home than i did in vietnam well isn't it funny that the vietnamese have
[02:19:34.840 --> 02:19:40.200]  taken to free market like a fish to water because they were always like that before and it's just
[02:19:40.200 --> 02:19:46.600]  it's so sad we had that war with them hey alex who doesn't want to be rich you know who doesn't
[02:19:47.160 --> 02:19:52.760]  but the trouble is some some people think they should be rich because you and i owe them a living
[02:19:52.760 --> 02:19:58.760]  now those people should not be rich unfortunately they're in congress that's right that's right
[02:19:58.760 --> 02:20:02.920]  and i see the arrogance well backing up because donnell trump obviously is the front runner the
[02:20:02.920 --> 02:20:07.320]  poll show now he could probably be hillary it's gonna be hillary now the democrats that's clear
[02:20:07.320 --> 02:20:11.560]  what a nightmare i know you don't like to get personal on things but i mean hillary really
[02:20:11.560 --> 02:20:18.040]  is a scary lady in my view been gauzy all of it uh the persecution of people politically i mean i'm
[02:20:18.040 --> 02:20:22.520]  gonna be under a microscope if she gets in especially uh tell us about donnell trump this
[02:20:22.520 --> 02:20:26.680]  means a lot to folks stories that don't break confidence but just what donnell trumps like
[02:20:26.680 --> 02:20:33.400]  behind the scenes and and why you think he's such a real guy well because what we see is donnell
[02:20:33.400 --> 02:20:40.200]  trump you know in the times i worked with him he was there was only one donnell trump the guy
[02:20:40.200 --> 02:20:45.960]  you see on the apprentice the guy you see on stage there's only one donnell trump and i was
[02:20:45.960 --> 02:20:50.120]  listening to joe scarborough the other day and he says you know the trouble with hillary is he
[02:20:50.120 --> 02:20:55.800]  doesn't know who he's talking to but the same could be said about joe also but anyway you know
[02:20:55.800 --> 02:21:01.800]  like the people the reason people love you alex is you are who you are and i do the best i can to
[02:21:01.800 --> 02:21:08.440]  be who i am and say really what i think more than i think but how i feel about things and i think
[02:21:08.440 --> 02:21:15.240]  our country's in trouble it is and i think our educational system from this many causes of this
[02:21:15.240 --> 02:21:21.400]  problem but we're not going to solve the gap between the rich and everybody else by welfare
[02:21:21.400 --> 02:21:28.120]  we've got to in our educational system teach people about money you said another word that i
[02:21:28.120 --> 02:21:34.200]  agree with a hundred percent and the word is kleptocracy see america is no longer a democracy
[02:21:34.760 --> 02:21:40.440]  it is now a kleptocracy and for those who may not know what that means word means a kleptocracy
[02:21:40.440 --> 02:21:48.600]  is when our leaders rip us off so this federal reserve bank in my opinion the ripoff wall street
[02:21:48.600 --> 02:21:55.720]  is ripping us off and we all know our political leaders are ripping us off for example you know
[02:21:55.720 --> 02:22:02.120]  when they try and get the price of prescription drugs down the lobbyists go in our own congressmen
[02:22:02.120 --> 02:22:08.360]  vote against lowering prices of prescription drugs that's why that last guy who that hedge fund guy
[02:22:09.160 --> 02:22:16.120]  bought some pill company and raised a pill price from ten dollars to 750 our own people
[02:22:16.120 --> 02:22:21.160]  are ripping us off now i'm not saying that's going to our bed but with a little financial
[02:22:21.160 --> 02:22:27.480]  education you would be able to make decisions or choices as to what's best for you and until
[02:22:27.480 --> 02:22:33.640]  we do that until until we stop telling people the government will take care of you don't worry about
[02:22:33.640 --> 02:22:39.320]  it we're never going to become a country again we're going to come apart between rich and poor
[02:22:39.320 --> 02:22:43.640]  i think it's key for entrepreneurs like yourself that is you probably got thousand people more
[02:22:43.640 --> 02:22:47.480]  more who knows how many working for you right now in all the industries and companies and mines
[02:22:47.480 --> 02:22:52.920]  and all the things you're doing there's the trailblazing entrepreneur that built this country
[02:22:52.920 --> 02:22:57.960]  that built the world that really loves expanding loves hiring people loves building civilization
[02:22:57.960 --> 02:23:02.920]  then there's the crony capitalist who use insider deals government regulations and they team up with
[02:23:02.920 --> 02:23:09.480]  the socialist and the other commander controllers and then they scapegoat capitalism for the rig
[02:23:09.480 --> 02:23:14.920]  scam like you said the stock market or they take over education bring all the government money into
[02:23:14.920 --> 02:23:19.240]  it make the price go up a couple thousand percent and then there's not even jobs for what they're
[02:23:19.240 --> 02:23:24.280]  giving you degrees in the education bubble all of it let's get into the economy where you see
[02:23:24.280 --> 02:23:29.480]  it going where where the system tells you to go versus where you've gone and the advice you've given
[02:23:29.480 --> 02:23:38.920]  so many people that's really helped folks well crony capitalism is another word for kleptocracy
[02:23:38.920 --> 02:23:46.200]  yes in other words i'd be like you and i getting together and scheming how we can screw your radio
[02:23:46.200 --> 02:23:53.240]  listeners and that's what's happening today democracy is gone capitalism is gone we're
[02:23:53.240 --> 02:24:01.800]  now into the rich ripping us all out now as i always say a coin has three sides heads tails
[02:24:01.800 --> 02:24:09.080]  and the edge and intelligence is found on the edge so that's why i'm not a republican or a democrat
[02:24:09.080 --> 02:24:13.880]  you know i'm not very religious by respect the person's right to religion and i don't get into
[02:24:13.880 --> 02:24:20.360]  those dogfights so as far as crony capitalism or kleptocracy goes this is going to sound
[02:24:20.360 --> 02:24:27.160]  hypocritical but i like those guys wall street is where i get my money from on the other side of
[02:24:27.160 --> 02:24:33.560]  the coin you know the two sides i mean three sides heads and tails and the edge wall street
[02:24:33.560 --> 02:24:38.440]  steals from the guys on the other side and all i'm saying here is you give somebody a little bit
[02:24:38.440 --> 02:24:44.920]  of education on how the game is played they have a choice whether they want to be on tails or they
[02:24:44.920 --> 02:24:51.320]  want to be on heads but without financial education they can't make that choice for example the reason
[02:24:51.320 --> 02:24:59.560]  i don't have a 401k full with with mutual funds and etfs and all that is in my opinion to rip off
[02:25:00.200 --> 02:25:06.040]  you know because i can beat those numbers all day long also i don't save money why would i save
[02:25:06.040 --> 02:25:12.600]  money when they have zero interest rate bonds today you know that's insanity if the average person
[02:25:12.600 --> 02:25:18.920]  that's all they know how to do invest in the stock market in the 401k for the long term and get ripped
[02:25:18.920 --> 02:25:24.680]  off which is terrible right now because of hft high frequency traders and dark pools it was the
[02:25:24.680 --> 02:25:30.200]  average guy has no idea what's happening and then they try and save money and they get zero
[02:25:30.200 --> 02:25:35.320]  interest on it so the poor middle class i mean the middle class is getting crushed right now
[02:25:35.320 --> 02:25:39.240]  instead what you do with your money and and of course you're the expert correct me what i'm
[02:25:39.240 --> 02:25:43.720]  wrong is you put it into new companies you put it into real estate you put it into mines you put
[02:25:43.720 --> 02:25:49.800]  it into you know hard things that are actually real that then on average expand and give you great
[02:25:49.800 --> 02:25:56.360]  yields and build a real physical economy not just some fiat economy right i provide a lot of jobs
[02:25:57.160 --> 02:26:03.800]  and this is the difference alex is that on my side and donnell's side we don't pay taxes either
[02:26:04.440 --> 02:26:11.320]  and the reason we don't pay taxes is because we do what the tax code asks us to do so we don't pay
[02:26:11.320 --> 02:26:19.960]  taxes because we provide jobs we don't look for jobs you know we we build houses we build property
[02:26:19.960 --> 02:26:26.360]  we don't live in a house i mean we build build real estate to provide housing so yeah the tax code
[02:26:26.360 --> 02:26:31.800]  of the world is very fair if you do what the government wants done the government will give
[02:26:31.800 --> 02:26:37.480]  you a tax break for example if i donate a hundred thousand to a charity they give me a tax break
[02:26:37.480 --> 02:26:43.640]  but the left you know the socialists like obama and hillar and all that they're trying to tell
[02:26:43.640 --> 02:26:50.280]  the poor and middle class that we're tax evaders now there are people who are tax evaders poor rich
[02:26:50.280 --> 02:26:56.600]  middle class there's always people evading taxes but we're taught to do it legally and that's the
[02:26:56.600 --> 02:27:01.720]  big difference that's what education is about it just gives you a choice to say well if i donate
[02:27:01.720 --> 02:27:07.880]  well if i donate more money or if i create jobs i could a tax break and if i build houses and
[02:27:07.880 --> 02:27:13.640]  apartment houses and businesses i could a tax break instead of saying that we're ripping them off
[02:27:14.360 --> 02:27:18.280]  but you know you're a real capitalist versus the cronies who will go get a banker bail out
[02:27:18.840 --> 02:27:23.480]  and then we'll lobby to raise middle class taxes because they're getting corporate welfare that's
[02:27:23.480 --> 02:27:29.400]  who we've got to separate out yes you got it correctly it's crony capitalism it's also called
[02:27:29.400 --> 02:27:35.240]  klepto don't clap the kleptocracy no these guys are abusing the laws you know they probably
[02:27:35.240 --> 02:27:42.520]  talks about the green span put and now the brunack you put the the crony capitalist knew if they lost
[02:27:42.520 --> 02:27:49.160]  all their money green span would bail them out they'd be like me going to los vegas and saying
[02:27:49.160 --> 02:27:56.440]  alex if i lose all my money you're going to pay me back aren't you of course i'd love you well
[02:27:56.440 --> 02:28:01.640]  we're in a race to try to get the general public educated i was watching a documentary called the
[02:28:01.640 --> 02:28:07.880]  best of enemies about gorba doll and william f buckley jr that came out a few months ago at the
[02:28:07.880 --> 02:28:11.960]  movie theater strangely enough the movie ended with me running and raving on television as if this
[02:28:11.960 --> 02:28:18.920]  was the symbol of the death of discourse but what i took away from it was that gorba doll was complaining
[02:28:19.720 --> 02:28:25.080]  in the film and i'm going from memory teleprompter free but he was in these debates in the early
[02:28:25.080 --> 02:28:31.160]  70s presidential debates and he's saying ten percent's got over half the wealth of this country
[02:28:31.160 --> 02:28:39.560]  we need to redistribute it and then i thought today two percent's got like 87 percent so by
[02:28:39.560 --> 02:28:48.920]  them bringing in more government more socialism it's actually made the poor a huge swarm the middle
[02:28:48.920 --> 02:28:54.040]  class has gotten tiny and then you've got this tiny elite up at the top who are trying to raise up
[02:28:54.040 --> 02:28:59.480]  the ladders and are complaining and attacking free market saying capitalism failed when they're
[02:28:59.480 --> 02:29:06.040]  pulling up the rope to the hot air balloon knowing full well what they're doing trying to bring feudalism
[02:29:06.040 --> 02:29:12.600]  back in i agree with you wholeheartedly and that's why donald and i asked what kind of guy he is
[02:29:12.600 --> 02:29:18.280]  the reason we wrote two books together one was why we want you to be rich two men one message
[02:29:18.280 --> 02:29:24.680]  another one was the mitis touch you know why some entrepreneurs get rich and most don't is because
[02:29:24.680 --> 02:29:31.080]  of financial education so i'm not really political as i said by republican or democrat but i support
[02:29:31.080 --> 02:29:34.680]  you're about facts stay there come back and talk about donald and you're gonna have the floor
[02:29:34.680 --> 02:29:38.520]  get into some basic financial education tell us about your new book and we're gonna open the
[02:29:38.520 --> 02:29:48.440]  phones up 800-259-9231 your chance to talk to rich dad dot com robert kiyosaki stay with us we're on
[02:29:48.440 --> 02:29:54.760]  the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:29:58.680 --> 02:30:03.240]  hillary clinton will testify in front of the bangazi committee and of course she's gonna try and
[02:30:03.240 --> 02:30:09.080]  spin this as just partisan politics but let's look at the facts they lied one of the first moves
[02:30:09.080 --> 02:30:14.840]  the obama administration made after the bangazi attack was to contact youtube in an apparent attempt
[02:30:14.840 --> 02:30:19.640]  to blame the attack on an obscure pastor john video this is according to state department
[02:30:19.640 --> 02:30:24.840]  documents obtained by judicial watch later the administration famously claimed the attack was
[02:30:24.840 --> 02:30:30.600]  provoked by another youtube video innocence of muslims made by an egyptian born filmmaker

[02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:23.720]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:33:30.360 --> 02:33:34.760]  i'm gonna play a clip here in a moment of donald trump saying 200 000 migrants from syria would
[02:33:34.760 --> 02:33:40.280]  be the biggest trojan horse ever it already is in europe six months ago ices said they would use a
[02:33:40.280 --> 02:33:45.960]  migrant wave to do this and now of course they're talking about millions and millions in europe
[02:33:47.080 --> 02:33:53.080]  the socialists are showing up filling these poor folks full of entitlement most of our military
[02:33:53.080 --> 02:33:59.560]  age men why would the socialists want to do this well we've got the head of the un board
[02:34:00.440 --> 02:34:05.880]  openly saying it's about ending the european culture that doesn't mean white people it means
[02:34:05.880 --> 02:34:11.960]  getting rid of the idea i guess just a free market renaissance and just getting rid of any
[02:34:11.960 --> 02:34:17.640]  culture uh it's it's it's political correctness and why would the left want to bring in radical
[02:34:17.640 --> 02:34:23.800]  islam let's play a clip here from donald trump and get our guest take on that here it is i was
[02:34:23.800 --> 02:34:30.360]  always a big fan of merkel from germany i'm not a fan anymore what she's doing is insane and we
[02:34:30.360 --> 02:34:36.120]  want to take in 200 000 and we don't know where they come from they have no papers all we know is
[02:34:36.120 --> 02:34:41.000]  they're young and they're strong and they're mostly men and this could be the greatest trojan horse
[02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:46.360]  ever this could be bigger than the original trojan horse we shouldn't be taking anybody we have enough
[02:34:46.360 --> 02:34:51.560]  problems we have to rebuild our country our infrastructure we owe 19 trillion dollars and
[02:34:51.560 --> 02:34:56.840]  by the way taken in 200 000 is going to cost us they just did a study over a period of 10 years
[02:34:56.840 --> 02:35:01.960]  going to cost us billions of dollars what are we doing merkel made a tremendous mistake they're
[02:35:01.960 --> 02:35:06.520]  going to end up having a revolution in germany you see what's happening with the german people
[02:35:06.520 --> 02:35:12.520]  now what we should do at the same time from a humane standpoint take a big chunk of syria
[02:35:12.520 --> 02:35:17.640]  and let's all put some money into it if we have to because on a humane basis and build a safe zone
[02:35:17.640 --> 02:35:22.920]  what's called the safe zone let the people but to allow them into germany and to allow them into
[02:35:22.920 --> 02:35:27.480]  these other countries where there's nothing but a horror show you see what's happening
[02:35:27.480 --> 02:35:33.240]  and now we're going to take in 200 000 people in this country insane and we can't breathe it is
[02:35:33.240 --> 02:35:37.880]  insane robert kiyosaki rich dad dot com is our guest good friends with donald trump and i mean to
[02:35:37.880 --> 02:35:43.320]  make this all a trumpesque interview but he's happy to do it um what do you think's behind the left
[02:35:44.120 --> 02:35:50.600]  wanting to you know complete the smuggling process bring in unlimited numbers of illegals here
[02:35:50.600 --> 02:35:56.440]  if you oppose paying for people's anchor babies you're racist but i can't go to mexico or syria
[02:35:56.440 --> 02:36:03.960]  and have kids for free i mean what do you think the end game of the socialist is here well i don't
[02:36:03.960 --> 02:36:09.080]  disagree or agree as i said i don't really like to take sides but it does come from the bible is
[02:36:09.080 --> 02:36:14.840]  and my my brother's keeper and i think that's that issue today you know these guys aren't my brothers
[02:36:14.840 --> 02:36:19.480]  that's the problem exactly if my brother wanted this much i don't know if i'd give it to him
[02:36:19.480 --> 02:36:25.320]  well i i have my own brothers and sisters who take care of and uh you know that's how
[02:36:25.320 --> 02:36:30.760]  i said family should take care of families and i kind of agree with donald i mean and i agree
[02:36:30.760 --> 02:36:37.080]  with you this guy putin's making us look like jokes and that's why i said the opposite of tyranny
[02:36:37.080 --> 02:36:44.520]  is anarchy and because we're weak i got an anarchist like i mean a tyrant like putin looks good
[02:36:44.520 --> 02:36:51.560]  so we have these people who think we can be soft power you know soft powers and culture them and
[02:36:51.560 --> 02:36:57.240]  cultureate them into the european or western culture or right now they're they want to kill us
[02:36:58.200 --> 02:37:01.560]  you know so i don't know i don't have a easy answer and i agree with trump
[02:37:02.440 --> 02:37:08.040]  i think we need almost tyrannical you know do something drastic otherwise we lose
[02:37:08.040 --> 02:37:15.000]  well we've been seeing the the tyranny of socialism and collectivism yes and and and they they call
[02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:21.640]  the constitution tyrannical and demonize it all day i think we just reapply that uh that will
[02:37:21.640 --> 02:37:27.640]  really get this country going again speaking of financial education for new listeners for young
[02:37:27.640 --> 02:37:31.720]  people tell us about some of your books that are the best for that obviously rich dad poor dad and
[02:37:31.720 --> 02:37:36.760]  many others but but what are some of the basics if you had five minutes to talk to say seventh
[02:37:36.760 --> 02:37:41.080]  graders about their future what would you say to them and then we're going to go to phone calls at
[02:37:41.080 --> 02:37:52.200]  800-259-9231-800-2599-231 carl alex brad adam marvin and others you'll get your chance to talk to
[02:37:52.200 --> 02:37:57.960]  robert keosaki now go ahead robert the reason there's a divide between the rich the one percent
[02:37:57.960 --> 02:38:05.080]  or a half percent and everybody else is because as i said a coin has three sides heads tails and the
[02:38:05.080 --> 02:38:12.760]  edge and everything the rich do is opposite of what the poor middle class do for example i don't
[02:38:12.760 --> 02:38:17.720]  encourage people saving money i mean why would you save money when interest rates are at zero and
[02:38:17.720 --> 02:38:23.880]  they're printing money also i don't invest in a 401k simply because you have to invest for the
[02:38:23.880 --> 02:38:30.040]  long term you're penalized for drawing out and mutual funds are the most expensive ways to invest
[02:38:30.040 --> 02:38:36.440]  and an etf the problem with an etf if the market crashes which it will etfs come down nine percent
[02:38:36.440 --> 02:38:42.040]  faster than a regular stock so the poor middle classes are sitting there they have a job they
[02:38:42.040 --> 02:38:48.440]  have student loan debt they're trying to save money putting the money in the stock market and
[02:38:48.440 --> 02:38:55.240]  they think their house is an asset so financial education will at least explain why the rich
[02:38:55.240 --> 02:39:00.680]  the rich are opposite doing the opposite of you and then this is a free country you can just say
[02:39:00.680 --> 02:39:07.160]  well do i want to be rich i mean middle class i mean poor it's your choice but without education
[02:39:07.720 --> 02:39:13.000]  you're only doing what the poor middle class are doing and the school system which was
[02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:19.960]  commandeered by named in john d iraqafeller 1903 never has financial education in the school system
[02:39:19.960 --> 02:39:26.360]  was that way we keep them stupid working for money and money is no longer money because in 1971
[02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:32.840]  you know president nixon took the dollar off the gold standard which meant the dollar became debt
[02:39:32.840 --> 02:39:38.040]  and we could print as much as we like and this is why we're so deeply in debt today now so it's
[02:39:38.040 --> 02:39:44.040]  opposite i use debt to get rich and the poor in the middle class use debt to get poor and that's
[02:39:44.040 --> 02:39:50.600]  what education is there's three sides to a coin heads tails and the edge and i stand on the edge
[02:39:51.560 --> 02:39:56.360]  education should allow the child to stand on the edge and decide what kind of education they want
[02:39:56.360 --> 02:40:02.920]  they want to be a middle class get a job work hard save money get out of debt that's their choice
[02:40:03.560 --> 02:40:09.000]  i didn't make that choice that all doesn't make that choice what about this new paradigm i mean
[02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:14.280]  it's not really new but really new to america how popular it's getting of class envy and a bernie
[02:40:14.280 --> 02:40:19.400]  sanders running around and people really believing that the way you're successful is have a bigger
[02:40:19.400 --> 02:40:24.280]  government that gives you more stuff don't they know everywhere that's been tried it leads to
[02:40:24.280 --> 02:40:33.160]  all out total hell on earth well desperate people do desperate things and i and from my
[02:40:33.160 --> 02:40:39.720]  examination of the entire system i suspect the socialist actually was a rich who really wanted
[02:40:39.720 --> 02:40:46.120]  to get the american people this week and this needy and this desperate i believe there is a
[02:40:46.120 --> 02:40:53.480]  conspiracy against america because the american dream was just too strong so if you if you can
[02:40:53.480 --> 02:41:00.280]  if you can break the spirit of americans so they're willing to take a measly handout we got them
[02:41:00.280 --> 02:41:05.960]  you and that's why there's no financial education in school there's a great book i'm sure you've
[02:41:05.960 --> 02:41:12.200]  you know the creature from jack o'allan yes riffin you know he said that the reason there's
[02:41:12.200 --> 02:41:19.880]  socialism is because communism couldn't crack the capitalist spirit of america so they needed
[02:41:19.880 --> 02:41:26.280]  socialism to weaken the spirit of us so that we would cave in to a government handout and let
[02:41:26.280 --> 02:41:31.560]  communism take over now i'm not saying that's true but it's got a ring to it you know it does well
[02:41:31.560 --> 02:41:37.080]  undoubtedly true words never been spoken than what you said about there being a project to break
[02:41:37.080 --> 02:41:42.360]  america the robber barons in 1900 i've i've read the the articles in the new york times where they
[02:41:42.360 --> 02:41:46.520]  talked about people are too educated they're reading too much they're too informed they're too
[02:41:46.520 --> 02:41:51.800]  entrepreneurial they're not trusting of centralized systems uh and they said we're gonna have to bring
[02:41:51.800 --> 02:41:57.720]  in our own education we're gonna have to create formulaic systems of compliant people then they
[02:41:57.720 --> 02:42:03.240]  sold it as the industrial revolution to basically have humanoid robots to put bottle caps on and
[02:42:03.240 --> 02:42:07.720]  to manufacture cars well now the computers are here and the robots the elites say they don't need
[02:42:07.720 --> 02:42:13.160]  us well that's not true we have to innovate into the next renaissance and people like you and
[02:42:13.160 --> 02:42:19.480]  donald trump and others obviously are right at the heart of that uh but to see as you said groups
[02:42:19.480 --> 02:42:25.320]  of the real elite that have made their money through combines as the founder of the rockefeller
[02:42:25.320 --> 02:42:31.880]  dynasty famously said competition is a sin it's these people that have to be exposed because
[02:42:32.920 --> 02:42:36.840]  they've been quoted as saying they wanted to create this dumbed-down mass of people
[02:42:36.840 --> 02:42:43.000]  and to break america's will because worldwide we were the shining city on a hill we were the model
[02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:49.960]  they couldn't compete with us the centralized systems in all their flavors couldn't do it and so uh
[02:42:49.960 --> 02:42:56.360]  they've taken us over and now we are a wreck but they haven't completely destroyed us and we could
[02:42:57.480 --> 02:43:02.600]  stand up again like the phoenix and become that example again but you're right the command and
[02:43:02.600 --> 02:43:09.160]  controllers the authoritarians the centralists they had to bring us down to win uh and i think
[02:43:09.160 --> 02:43:13.320]  they've done a pretty good job but i think we can turn this around what do you say robert well let's
[02:43:13.320 --> 02:43:18.120]  start with education you know like a rich dad poor dad my poor dad was ahead of education for the
[02:43:18.120 --> 02:43:24.200]  state of hawaii he's a very good man but he knew nothing about money and my rich dad was a man who
[02:43:24.200 --> 02:43:29.160]  didn't go to school was maybe unfortunate i'm not against education i'm against bad education
[02:43:29.720 --> 02:43:34.120]  my my rich dad was an entrepreneur so he never understood they never understood each other
[02:43:34.120 --> 02:43:41.400]  when i did my research into it exactly what you said in 1903 rockefeller and jp and those boys
[02:43:41.400 --> 02:43:48.200]  got together and they commandeered the educational system of america via the general education board
[02:43:48.920 --> 02:43:54.520]  and the only purpose of the general education board was to take farm kids and turn them into
[02:43:54.520 --> 02:43:59.640]  factory workers they was never to teach them about money so that's why when i go to school
[02:43:59.640 --> 02:44:05.720]  sometimes what you learn about money they say nothing or they say well invest in the for the
[02:44:05.720 --> 02:44:12.680]  long term in a 401k and i'm going they're playing right into the capitalist or the kleptography
[02:44:12.680 --> 02:44:18.520]  you know the kleptographs what all those guys are so they play into the crony capitalism so they
[02:44:18.520 --> 02:44:24.360]  give all their money to wall street wall street bets it into the markets they lose the fed bails
[02:44:24.360 --> 02:44:30.280]  them out and we bail out the fed that's the system it's corrupt yet i like it works for me
[02:44:31.960 --> 02:44:36.760]  and that's what you're saying is you work to try to change the system and you don't do anything
[02:44:36.760 --> 02:44:41.960]  immoral but you at the same time use all the loopholes they've created for themselves the little
[02:44:41.960 --> 02:44:48.200]  escape patches yeah but there really are when i when i looked at the tax laws is my account
[02:44:48.200 --> 02:44:52.360]  what a book is called tax free wealth by tom we all write everybody should get that book
[02:44:52.360 --> 02:44:57.800]  because the tax laws are written for capitalists if you do what the government wants done they'll
[02:44:57.800 --> 02:45:03.080]  give you a tax break like you donate money they'll give you a tax break so my whole point of view
[02:45:03.080 --> 02:45:09.240]  is financial education is not to change delirium or bernie and all that stuff financial education
[02:45:09.240 --> 02:45:14.360]  is self-protection do you think bernie's for real i mean he comes off like a muppet character
[02:45:14.360 --> 02:45:19.560]  he really is hard to listen to and watch well depends on a point of view but the but the facts
[02:45:19.560 --> 02:45:25.000]  are bernie and ron paul were the only guys that stood up to wall street you know so they're right
[02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:29.560]  he went well paul was for real though as you know when sanders finally was the deciding vote the
[02:45:29.560 --> 02:45:34.280]  senate he killed a real audit though yeah but at least they stand up to it what the other guys
[02:45:34.280 --> 02:45:39.240]  at crony capitalist go along with it and they profit from it you know again look at pharmaceuticals
[02:45:39.240 --> 02:45:44.520]  the reason drug prices in america are so high is because our congress wants it that way because
[02:45:44.520 --> 02:45:50.360]  they take the bribes or the campaign finances from them i'm not saying that's right or wrong but i'm
[02:45:50.360 --> 02:45:56.040]  saying if you're poor and you can't afford drugs you're in trouble big trouble and that's why you
[02:45:56.040 --> 02:46:03.160]  know what they found out about health care is the rich rich men who are rich live about 15 years
[02:46:03.160 --> 02:46:08.840]  longer than poor men that's true and rich and rich women live about 20 years longer than poor women
[02:46:08.840 --> 02:46:12.360]  because they have better health care they can afford it they also are more informed on any
[02:46:12.360 --> 02:46:18.840]  better food you're absolutely right robert kiyosaki is our guest let's go to carl in texas you're on
[02:46:18.840 --> 02:46:25.720]  the air go ahead carl hey alex and robert you're my two biggest fans of listening to both for years
[02:46:25.720 --> 02:46:31.720]  robert i've been dying to talk to you for 12 years so here's my question with all of what alex has
[02:46:31.720 --> 02:46:36.520]  been sharing about staying or leaving you know about protecting his family like i would think the
[02:46:36.520 --> 02:46:42.360]  same way if something really does go bad here in this country do you stand your ground or you move
[02:46:43.160 --> 02:46:46.760]  would you stand your ground here in this country and what's the best state to live in
[02:46:46.760 --> 02:46:51.640]  to stand your ground if you're going to make it in this country or what country will do they'll
[02:46:51.640 --> 02:46:55.800]  probably say no state and just move around and i want to be clear i'm not leaving the country
[02:46:56.440 --> 02:47:02.840]  i've just said that watching them trash it like this is very painful and and and so a lot of people
[02:47:02.840 --> 02:47:07.320]  are leaving the united states but you're out of the fire into the you know oven robert your take on
[02:47:07.320 --> 02:47:14.120]  that well i think you and i i think you and i are brothers at the heart we stand and fight
[02:47:14.760 --> 02:47:20.680]  you know we stand and fight by information by speaking out by being unpopular about saying
[02:47:20.680 --> 02:47:26.760]  things that are politically incorrect so that's what i think we should do is just stand up and
[02:47:26.760 --> 02:47:31.720]  fight not just say it again financial education gives you and your family protection from the
[02:47:31.720 --> 02:47:36.600]  very guys the club talk she was ripping us off and that's how i see it you know i'm not going to
[02:47:36.600 --> 02:47:41.240]  change the government that they're bunch of idiots anyway the best revenge is living well as the
[02:47:41.240 --> 02:47:47.800]  french say what's that the best revenge is living well yeah and but being not being stupid without
[02:47:47.800 --> 02:47:55.000]  financial education and so that's that question i think i you know i fought for america nine years
[02:47:55.000 --> 02:48:00.440]  as a marine i love this country you know it's been very good to me fourth generation japanese
[02:48:00.440 --> 02:48:07.400]  american i'm glad it wasn't born in japan but it saddens me because it does alex to see our
[02:48:07.400 --> 02:48:12.040]  country being sold down the drain out of ignorance that's what saddens me you're right it is the
[02:48:12.040 --> 02:48:17.320]  public's ignorance that allows it to happen yeah and it saddens me to see the american public
[02:48:17.320 --> 02:48:22.840]  with american spirit get broken you know people came to america not because they wanted welfare
[02:48:22.840 --> 02:48:28.040]  they came to america because they wanted the american dream and that's god now the middle
[02:48:28.040 --> 02:48:33.560]  class is toast the number of poor is increasing watch one more thing alex listen to this okay
[02:48:33.560 --> 02:48:38.520]  one of the most dangerous thing was his 401k i know a lot of people love him and all this stuff i
[02:48:38.520 --> 02:48:45.320]  think it's a good deal but the 401k didn't exist until 1980 so the baby boom generation is the
[02:48:45.320 --> 02:48:53.080]  first generation in history to have what's called a defined contribution plan this is my prediction
[02:48:53.080 --> 02:48:59.160]  in a few years the baby boom generation which has been the most fortunate generation in ever in
[02:48:59.160 --> 02:49:07.000]  history many of them will run out of money before they die absolutely let's see we're going to see
[02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:13.720]  a problem so big like in hawaii where i'm from you know homeless homeless people are going through
[02:49:13.720 --> 02:49:18.840]  for the highest per capita homeless people that's the future because these baby boomers will run out
[02:49:18.840 --> 02:49:24.440]  of money before they die it is going to be a hellish situation brad you're on the air from
[02:49:24.440 --> 02:49:31.240]  pennsylvania with robert kiyosaki go ahead well thanks alex and robert you're what a great guest
[02:49:31.240 --> 02:49:40.200]  you are and on that note on the on 401k you know i of course i'm one person paying into mine and
[02:49:40.200 --> 02:49:46.520]  but after listening to alex for almost 18 years i guess now thank goodness i realize that's probably
[02:49:46.520 --> 02:49:52.280]  not even going to be there i'm just probably just throwing it away but it's a tax break it's
[02:49:52.280 --> 02:49:56.840]  i don't have a pension anymore my company so what choice do i have but i do hear what you're saying
[02:49:56.840 --> 02:50:02.040]  and and on an on your other note about this country both you guys are true patriots thank you for
[02:50:02.040 --> 02:50:09.560]  everything thank you thank you thank you what thanks i'm not against the 401k i i think you
[02:50:09.560 --> 02:50:14.360]  should be made aware of what it was designed to do and today you know the world has changed
[02:50:14.360 --> 02:50:20.280]  is 1980 we have high frequency trading and info wars today instead of investing for the long term
[02:50:20.280 --> 02:50:24.600]  the professionals are in and out of the market that's right they're screwing over the system
[02:50:24.600 --> 02:50:28.840]  they're breaking the social contract is what robert's warning you about brad anything else
[02:50:28.840 --> 02:50:34.120]  you had a question yeah i was just gonna say that you guys thank you for everything you do about
[02:50:34.120 --> 02:50:39.400]  like for this country if we just if you don't believe it's conspiracy just look at how bad it is
[02:50:39.400 --> 02:50:44.280]  and how good it could be i mean it's so easy to just turn this around hopefully trump your friend
[02:50:44.280 --> 02:50:48.440]  trump will do that robert if he gets in there i sure hope he's for real i want to believe robert i
[02:50:48.440 --> 02:50:52.840]  mean why wouldn't he want to save the country why wouldn't he want to be like george washington i
[02:50:52.840 --> 02:50:57.400]  don't want to believe that he's another slimy politician he better not be we'll be right back

[02:55:16.680 --> 02:55:19.800]  but briefly what do you think about this open attack on the second amendment
[02:55:19.800 --> 02:55:24.120]  polls show more people are becoming pro-gun but the democrats don't seem to care i know
[02:55:24.120 --> 02:55:27.960]  you're non-partisan so am i but man these democrats they really are something else
[02:55:29.160 --> 02:55:35.000]  i tell you what you know if i gave up my guns and nobody stopped and they stopped people
[02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:39.640]  killing each other i give up my guns but you and i know giving up our guns and bullets is not
[02:55:39.640 --> 02:55:44.280]  going to stop people from killing each other and that's my problem with it you know i'm a former
[02:55:44.280 --> 02:55:51.880]  marine i love guns i have full automatic weapons you know i am armed i carry why because i don't
[02:55:51.880 --> 02:55:56.680]  want to be a victim i'm not out there to kill somebody i just don't want to be a informed
[02:55:56.680 --> 02:56:03.080]  empowered man taking care of his own security yes and i know how to use my guns i practice a lot
[02:56:03.080 --> 02:56:10.280]  so uh i'm not pro or against it it's a personal decision but if somebody comes into my house i
[02:56:10.280 --> 02:56:14.120]  am going to shoot them yeah i'm not going to try and reason with them and you're not looking for
[02:56:14.120 --> 02:56:18.360]  trouble you're just like a you know like a tiger uh sitting there in the trees somebody comes up

[02:56:47.400 --> 02:56:53.240]  monetary policy i feel like is the root of our problems here as a nation and i maybe i missed
[02:56:53.240 --> 02:57:00.600]  it but i've been following the uh candidates and i haven't heard trump comment on that it that's a
[02:57:00.600 --> 02:57:03.640]  good question you're really good friends with me written books with him on monetary policy
[02:57:03.640 --> 02:57:07.960]  you're a critic of the private fellow reserve or that consortium uh can you tell us donald's
[02:57:07.960 --> 02:57:13.800]  view on the fed or or what you think it is i don't you know donald says it best it has to do
[02:57:13.800 --> 02:57:20.120]  with immigration he says we're a nation of laws and when we have people our own leaders breaking
[02:57:20.120 --> 02:57:26.200]  the laws when it comes to money we have very very big problems it's not the system that's bad it is
[02:57:26.200 --> 02:57:33.320]  corrupt but talk topocracy that's bad when you have the fed that boys up wall street and wall
[02:57:33.320 --> 02:57:40.600]  street sends out toxic uh cds and so they shouldn't be propping up the garbage yeah and then we bail
[02:57:40.600 --> 02:57:46.280]  them out and then our our government our politicians support that then our school systems teach us
[02:57:46.280 --> 02:57:51.240]  nothing about money to me there's something rotten you know there's some this not money that's the
[02:57:51.240 --> 02:57:57.080]  brutal ball evil is financial ignorance that's why donald and i reason we write and we speak

[03:01:00.520 --> 03:01:05.080]  two five three three one three nine and it is your purchase of the products that makes it all
[03:01:05.080 --> 03:01:11.240]  possible by the way pro pure g2 great as well you can see the side-by-side comparisons this
[03:01:11.240 --> 03:01:18.600]  definitely has faster flow right but also they got stuff like the portable pitchers that alexa pure
[03:01:18.600 --> 03:01:25.240]  doesn't have so again we just carry all the best stuff we can find and i mean we find more great
[03:01:25.240 --> 03:01:29.880]  stuff we'll carry it as well it's just hard to find good stuff out there and this is a new level

[03:01:39.240 --> 03:01:45.320]  he had to go uh but uh you you you've got a view uh you you heard his view on guns what do you have
[03:01:45.320 --> 03:01:51.480]  to say yeah um my my view wasn't the question i had it was probably going to put them pretty much on
[03:01:51.480 --> 03:01:59.400]  the spot was uh the 1968 gun law would he try to try to would donald be in favor of treating a gun
[03:01:59.400 --> 03:02:06.680]  like a knife um etc etc trot has been saying repeal gun laws and go to open carry that the
[03:02:06.680 --> 03:02:12.600]  constitution is your right he's really gotten a lot better trump was bad 10 years ago so that's
[03:02:12.600 --> 03:02:16.040]  why i don't completely trust him the that's why we're investigating him and that's what that was
[03:02:16.040 --> 03:02:20.280]  was an investigation last hour and i've talked to a lot of people behind the scenes they say
[03:02:20.280 --> 03:02:24.680]  trump's pretty libertarian behind the scenes and we all used to be ignorant uh the word is he
[03:02:24.680 --> 03:02:29.640]  listens to this show trump's talked about info wars a few times and maybe maybe trump doesn't
[03:02:29.640 --> 03:02:34.840]  want to see america destroyed maybe he's woken up i don't know what do you think yeah that that was
[03:02:34.840 --> 03:02:39.880]  the what do i think i'm in your boat i'm still leary i want to believe everything but i also
[03:02:39.880 --> 03:02:45.640]  don't want to be the obama voter exactly i'm up for it and um but like like i said um
[03:02:46.520 --> 03:02:52.440]  i live out in uh the ghetto of lakeway and it's a beautiful place no problems but then i think
[03:02:52.440 --> 03:02:57.640]  about these inner city guys that get into trouble but then get out of jail and then have to protect
[03:02:57.640 --> 03:03:02.440]  themselves because they're in a violent society but then they they're create they're committing
[03:03:02.440 --> 03:03:06.440]  that's another felony by just carrying the yeah the only people that you've got to
[03:03:08.280 --> 03:03:13.480]  take their rights away after they're out of prison are like child molesters i mean look when
[03:03:13.480 --> 03:03:17.960]  you've done your time you're out don't restrict your travel don't restrict your right to defense
[03:03:17.960 --> 03:03:20.920]  don't restrict your right to property let people start over again

[03:03:28.120 --> 03:03:31.800]  know listen they could set me up next week and make me a felon and then i don't have guns
[03:03:31.800 --> 03:03:35.160]  and to protect my family and then i'm supposed to hire bodyguards i'm not the money for that
[03:03:35.800 --> 03:03:39.960]  i mean i have to let go a bunch of employees if i hired bodyguards i'm not doing that
[03:03:39.960 --> 03:03:45.400]  i got guns right here the guns in my car and i'm not afraid of somebody coming at me whatever

[03:08:31.960 --> 03:08:35.880]  show he's going to be talking about all the things that are going on the news concerning
[03:08:36.680 --> 03:08:40.920]  weapons what you can do for yourself to get yourself armed also but all these politicians
[03:08:40.920 --> 03:08:45.000]  are calling for hillary wants to take your guns just like obama just like bloomberg
[03:08:45.000 --> 03:08:49.880]  and the rest of the gang but right now let's go back to calls we have do we have a caller
[03:08:49.880 --> 03:08:55.480]  holding over or did he drop off okay so that guy dropped off we're going to go now to mic in california
[03:08:55.480 --> 03:09:06.280]  jacquard jackson yes hello it's an honor to speak with you oh yes uh my life and me campaign
[03:09:06.280 --> 03:09:12.600]  for ron paul in 2008 and 2012 with the prospect of donald trump getting it in the presidency
[03:09:13.320 --> 03:09:18.760]  we're concerned that ron paul isn't speaking up enough to put himself in a position of vice
[03:09:18.760 --> 03:09:24.760]  presidency for consideration for donald trump what do you say about that well you know i have no
[03:09:24.760 --> 03:09:29.480]  issue with rand being a vice president but from what i understand trumps has been hitting that
[03:09:29.480 --> 03:09:35.000]  having karsten ron or at least that he's throwing that out there i think rand is probably the best
[03:09:35.000 --> 03:09:39.400]  guy on the republican ticket you know i think trump he has his high points just as alex was
[03:09:39.400 --> 03:09:44.680]  talking about in the last segment he's become more pro second amendment now of course we know
[03:09:44.680 --> 03:09:49.480]  the guy's an entertainer i'm not sure how much of this is sincere and coming from his heart so
[03:09:49.480 --> 03:09:55.160]  that's what concerns me about trump but i'd rather if i couldn't get rand i'd rather have trump than
[03:09:55.160 --> 03:10:02.760]  most of the other guys in the republican party all right well thank you we'll move on to our next
[03:10:02.760 --> 03:10:10.120]  caller we now have paul in new mexico go ahead paul yeah i just want to say like i'm like from 80
[03:10:10.120 --> 03:10:16.600]  percent trusting trump to like 99.9 percent because you know like alex he has to engage the enemy in
[03:10:16.600 --> 03:10:21.080]  facebook and twitter because you can't he can't afford the bandwidth i think in the same respect
[03:10:21.080 --> 03:10:26.680]  trump is engaging the enemy by buying favors from people hillary or whatnot because he has to because
[03:10:26.680 --> 03:10:32.040]  he has to that's how our corrupt system corrupt system works so trump is the ultimate infiltrator
[03:10:32.040 --> 03:10:38.040]  of the system i'm hoping he can sabotage the system from inside and blow it up most of the
[03:10:38.040 --> 03:10:43.720]  time you have to play the goblas game by attacking them from the inside but i think we
[03:10:43.720 --> 03:10:48.680]  most time you have to attack them from the outside of the box not from the inside of the box but in
[03:10:48.680 --> 03:10:53.880]  trump's case i think he can attack him from the inside and i now understand trump i now trust
[03:10:53.880 --> 03:10:58.920]  trump because he's i knew more people need to start stomping and trumping stomping for trump because
[03:10:59.800 --> 03:11:05.560]  um you know i understand now why trump buys favors he buys favors because he has to that's
[03:11:05.560 --> 03:11:10.280]  how the system is played just like you play the alex plays the media game by engaging in their
[03:11:10.280 --> 03:11:15.080]  ghettos of facebook and twitter in the same respect that's how trump has to engage and play on their
[03:11:15.080 --> 03:11:20.040]  football field alex plays on the media's football field and that's all trump is doing is playing on
[03:11:20.040 --> 03:11:25.800]  the system's football field so that's all i gotta say well thank you paul i remember the first debate
[03:11:26.440 --> 03:11:31.880]  with trump and the most interesting thing to come out of that debate in my opinion was when
[03:11:31.880 --> 03:11:36.840]  trump said that he's pretty much the guy behind the curtain because we all know that at the high
[03:11:36.840 --> 03:11:40.600]  level politics i guess at any level politics you have the guy behind the curtains the guy with
[03:11:40.600 --> 03:11:45.400]  a pocketbook and they call up the phone the midnight hour hey i need you to do x y and z
[03:11:45.400 --> 03:11:49.960]  and then the person does it because not only do they owe trump or whoever the guy is a favor
[03:11:49.960 --> 03:11:55.240]  but they want another favor in the future so you know i think that was very much something that
[03:11:55.240 --> 03:11:59.480]  should have been expanded upon but they just breezed past it like it was never even said so
[03:11:59.480 --> 03:12:03.880]  you made some very good points let's move on now to kevin in florida go ahead
[03:12:03.880 --> 03:12:13.400]  hi how you doing i'm a huge fan of the show um and my question or actually i just want to take on
[03:12:13.400 --> 03:12:20.440]  this is with everything it has to do with hillary how can any sane individual especially women and
[03:12:20.440 --> 03:12:25.560]  this is more engaged toward women people so maybe you can land back to do on there to answer this
[03:12:25.560 --> 03:12:31.960]  question later on but how can any sane person believe anything that hillary quentin has to say
[03:12:31.960 --> 03:12:38.840]  anything that she does and how how can anybody vote for this lady she's a total criminal and
[03:12:38.840 --> 03:12:44.840]  as far as it goes for women she is trying to strip women of their rights and parental things more
[03:12:44.840 --> 03:12:52.280]  than anybody else that's running i just wanted to get your take on that yes the thing about hillary
[03:12:52.280 --> 03:12:56.600]  i remember back when she was running against obama and we played the clip here several times
[03:12:56.600 --> 03:13:00.360]  where clinton said yeah i got off the helicopter and people were shooting at me i can't remember
[03:13:00.360 --> 03:13:04.920]  where it was but she i got off the helicopter people were shooting at me and then they played
[03:13:04.920 --> 03:13:09.720]  the footage of her testimony side by side with the footage of what actually happened and she gets
[03:13:09.720 --> 03:13:15.160]  off the plane she's smiling she signs a autograph for a little girl and i think the rationale for
[03:13:15.160 --> 03:13:20.280]  not just clinton but a lot of these guys obama whoever else is well maybe they're doing it or
[03:13:20.280 --> 03:13:24.760]  did something bad but other people have done things bad in the past as well for example
[03:13:24.760 --> 03:13:30.600]  oftentimes bring up a bring up fast and furious i bring up the situation in syria and this might
[03:13:30.600 --> 03:13:37.240]  will quickly retort me well well bush did this and and reagan did that i ran contra i'm like okay
[03:13:37.240 --> 03:13:41.400]  yeah but they're not in office right now they're not the people being held responsible i can't
[03:13:41.400 --> 03:13:46.120]  do anything about what reagan did but i can speak out about what obama is currently doing and hopefully
[03:13:46.120 --> 03:13:50.600]  that'll wake people up and get some accountability in the office so i'm not sure if that answers
[03:13:50.600 --> 03:13:55.720]  your question but basically let's go the counter argument that i always run into uh yeah this
[03:13:55.720 --> 03:13:59.320]  person's bad but other people have done bad things in the past will just let them be
[03:13:59.320 --> 03:14:03.240]  who they are even though we keep getting this narrative of hope and change and make
[03:14:03.240 --> 03:14:09.080]  america great again and all that kind of deal thank you so much kevin let's go on to alan in
[03:14:09.080 --> 03:14:17.800]  missouri go ahead alan hey jacari how you doing very well yes i can okay good hey listen i was
[03:14:17.800 --> 03:14:23.560]  listening to uh the interview with uh ron paul yesterday with alex and he was talking about
[03:14:23.560 --> 03:14:28.520]  a form of passive resistance where people stop participating in the system and it occurred to
[03:14:28.520 --> 03:14:33.160]  me it's an idea that i've been holding on for a long time is that i used to work jobs where i was
[03:14:33.160 --> 03:14:40.360]  paid strictly uh contract labor where the employer did not withhold taxes from my check well i think
[03:14:40.360 --> 03:14:44.920]  and i may be ignorant on the topic but i think that any employer can pay contract labor and if
[03:14:44.920 --> 03:14:51.560]  that's the case then the employer and the employee can each individually and that's all of us decide
[03:14:51.560 --> 03:14:55.800]  whether or not we want to fund the machine that's choking the life out of us i mean at this point
[03:14:55.800 --> 03:15:02.200]  right here i'm paying literally almost six hundred dollars a week in taxes that's a lot of money man
[03:15:02.200 --> 03:15:08.440]  you know uh i'm a truck driver so i mean they're killing me man you know yeah i hear that as i'll
[03:15:08.440 --> 03:15:14.680]  go ahead no i would i mean i would just love to not have to pay taxes and and pay for a machine
[03:15:15.320 --> 03:15:20.600]  that i don't believe in anything that they're doing anyway i agree with that you know they always
[03:15:20.600 --> 03:15:25.320]  take our tax dollars and you know the old adage they have money for war but they can't feed the poor
[03:15:25.320 --> 03:15:30.360]  and you know always hear this argument you know after 9 11 or whatever well the american people
[03:15:30.360 --> 03:15:35.560]  demanded you know the tsa or they demanded all these security regulations like nobody came and asked me
[03:15:35.560 --> 03:15:39.800]  do i want to get groped to the airport or if i want the nsa to listen to my phone calls or
[03:15:39.800 --> 03:15:44.120]  if i want to go send drones to blow up wedding parties over in some foreign country nobody
[03:15:44.120 --> 03:15:48.600]  asked my permission for it but they take my tax dollars and go and do those things anyway
[03:15:48.600 --> 03:15:53.800]  so i agree with you as far as the legality of it i'm not a business owner so i'm pretty sure there
[03:15:53.800 --> 03:15:58.440]  are other people who can speak more to that than i can but yeah i'd be all for it i don't want to pay
[03:15:58.440 --> 03:16:03.320]  any more money to these people so they can have their secret services you know aiming you know
[03:16:03.320 --> 03:16:08.040]  guns of people or you know on rooftops when obama driving by meanwhile they don't want me to have
[03:16:08.040 --> 03:16:13.000]  a firearm when i go out in the streets thank you so much alan we will clear the decks now ahead
[03:16:13.000 --> 03:16:17.560]  of our guest michael cargill who's going to talk about us talk to us about the second amendment
[03:16:17.560 --> 03:16:22.520]  later on in our show kit daniels ran in here just a second ago and i guess this is his new
[03:16:22.520 --> 03:16:30.040]  article on info wars dot com hashtag black lives matter co-founder calls capitalism racist it says
[03:16:30.040 --> 03:16:37.320]  capitalism is racist according to black lives co-founder alisha garza so the the thing about
[03:16:37.320 --> 03:16:43.080]  the black lives matter movement and i talked about this before what leon macadoo we definitely see
[03:16:43.080 --> 03:16:50.280]  some shenanigans sometimes bordering on criminal activity coming from the group but there are also
[03:16:50.280 --> 03:16:54.600]  a lot of peaceful demonstrators that are in the group as well for example when we first went out
[03:16:54.600 --> 03:16:58.840]  to ferguson last year and there's a lot of peaceful demonstrators kind of like what you see in that
[03:16:58.840 --> 03:17:03.400]  photo people sitting there in the streets with their signs black lives matter and so on and so
[03:17:03.400 --> 03:17:08.440]  forth but you also have the other extreme of that of people they go to events where veterans are
[03:17:08.440 --> 03:17:13.320]  getting their medals and you know they harass them when they go harass people who are you know in
[03:17:13.320 --> 03:17:17.880]  the in the lunch line or whatever else so you know there's kind of two sides to the group but
[03:17:17.880 --> 03:17:23.000]  definitely i think there is a lot of uh as there are a lot of groups a lot of controlled opposition
[03:17:23.000 --> 03:17:27.480]  a lot of people who are infiltrating the group for their own nefarious purposes so you can definitely
[03:17:27.480 --> 03:17:33.800]  check that out on info wars.com now tonight on the nightly news darin mcbreen is going to be talking
[03:17:33.800 --> 03:17:38.680]  about all things mingazi so just to give you a little bit of taste of that i have this article
[03:17:38.680 --> 03:17:45.480]  about hillary clinton a clinton on mingazi christopher stevens was responsible for his own safety
[03:17:45.480 --> 03:17:50.920]  now i want everybody to think about this because this is a a nation all these politicians who say
[03:17:50.920 --> 03:17:55.240]  that they're going to keep us safe you don't need a firearm you don't need a second amendment if
[03:17:55.240 --> 03:17:59.720]  something happens we're going to swoop in and arrest you you but in the case of ambassador
[03:17:59.720 --> 03:18:06.680]  stevens who called or sent out the email several times to mrs clinton we have the clip about 600
[03:18:06.680 --> 03:18:11.960]  calls made on various days and times to get the proper security and how do they respond when it
[03:18:11.960 --> 03:18:17.160]  came down to the brass tax they took security away from this guy so this is why this is my what i
[03:18:17.160 --> 03:18:21.560]  implore all the people of america to understand they're saying that they're going to protect you
[03:18:21.560 --> 03:18:25.960]  no they're going to protect themselves and not even everybody in the government i mean protect
[03:18:25.960 --> 03:18:29.560]  themselves like hillary is going to protect herself bloomberg is going to protect himself
[03:18:29.560 --> 03:18:34.040]  obama is going to protect himself ambassador stevens even though you call it several times you
[03:18:34.040 --> 03:18:38.520]  sit send out all these emails and then you know right before they took away your security you're
[03:18:38.520 --> 03:18:43.000]  responsible for your own death is pretty much is what she's saying even though she was rightly
[03:18:44.120 --> 03:18:48.360]  alerted of all the information that was going on so you can find out more about that
[03:18:48.360 --> 03:18:54.360]  with darryl mcbrane later on in the info wars nightly news 7 p.m. central now before we go to
[03:18:54.360 --> 03:18:59.720]  break quickly i want to touch on joe biden and you guys know that he dropped out of the race
[03:18:59.720 --> 03:19:04.120]  yesterday and there's a lot of speculation they're saying that the war machine the clinton war machine
[03:19:04.120 --> 03:19:09.720]  was going to destroy him and i'm not a fan of biden you know all of his uh policy is going along
[03:19:09.720 --> 03:19:14.680]  with the bomb administration the things i talked about uh fast and furious syria all these other
[03:19:14.680 --> 03:19:19.480]  things going on telling people to go off on their balcony and shoot the shotgun like yosemite sam of
[03:19:19.480 --> 03:19:24.680]  course if you do that you're going to wind up in a jailhouse but now we have the report that
[03:19:24.680 --> 03:19:30.040]  advisors told biden the clinton war machine is going to destroy you so now biden has stepped out
[03:19:30.040 --> 03:19:36.360]  and pretty much cleared the decks for an all-on full-on hillary assault so i definitely expect
[03:19:36.360 --> 03:19:41.240]  hillary to get the nomination at this point because he was in my opinion her best competition of course
[03:19:41.240 --> 03:19:45.080]  there are sanders and other guys out there but i think he was the guy who was really going to
[03:19:45.080 --> 03:19:49.960]  challenge her so stay tuned we'll be back right after this break this is the info wars overdrive

[03:26:42.280 --> 03:26:48.600]  dress up as a cowboy or as a geisha girl or wear a sombrero you know and i don't spend a lot of
[03:26:48.600 --> 03:26:53.880]  time in bars but sometimes i go out see a soccer game or maybe playing a soccer game when i'm out
[03:26:53.880 --> 03:26:58.360]  and about you know guys wear sombreros or whatever and it's not that big of a deal you know if i see
[03:26:58.360 --> 03:27:03.720]  some asian guy wearing a cowboy hat i don't call him a racist but you know who knows that's the
[03:27:03.720 --> 03:27:09.080]  politically correct world that we live in now that's the qatar threatened military intervention
[03:27:09.080 --> 03:27:14.680]  in syria demascus warrants of harsh response that's a great article by kurt nimo and what
[03:27:14.680 --> 03:27:19.640]  we've been talking about here recently the clinton testimony now as i said earlier
[03:27:20.200 --> 03:27:28.760]  mrs clinton this woman who has bodyguards lies about being shot at by snipers uh ignores emails
[03:27:28.760 --> 03:27:34.200]  when people are begging for help so they won't become murdered individuals and all manner of
[03:27:34.200 --> 03:27:38.520]  other things has come out today and said that ambassador stevens was pretty much responsible
[03:27:38.520 --> 03:27:45.800]  for his own death because uh i guess she didn't feel like reading his emails now i had a chance to
[03:27:45.800 --> 03:27:50.760]  speak to larry nickles the clinton insider he worked on bill's campaign also spent a good
[03:27:50.760 --> 03:27:55.800]  amount of time with hillary as well back in the day and uh he was telling me that if he was writing
[03:27:55.800 --> 03:28:00.840]  the clinton campaign he'd be doing it exactly as it is which is to say yes hillary is getting beat
[03:28:00.840 --> 03:28:06.680]  up in the media she's having to testify she has all these things going on around her but he says
[03:28:06.680 --> 03:28:12.200]  for a clinton to win they have to run as an underdog bill was an underdog at the time of
[03:28:13.000 --> 03:28:17.480]  his uh his elections and so forth and they're doing the same thing with hillary so what they're
[03:28:17.480 --> 03:28:22.680]  going to do according to larry is they're just going to continue to beat her down and eventually
[03:28:22.680 --> 03:28:28.840]  you know uh biden stepping out was a good deal for her and boosts more focus on her but eventually
[03:28:29.480 --> 03:28:33.720]  after they beat her down for so long they say look look at this strong woman she's overcoming
[03:28:33.720 --> 03:28:39.400]  they came after her on the emails they came after her unbenghazi but she has risen like a phoenix
[03:28:39.400 --> 03:28:44.280]  and she's going to lead us into the new promise land you know whatever sensational derivative
[03:28:44.280 --> 03:28:49.480]  of that they choose to go with and it seems like larry's pretty on about that so you guys can go
[03:28:49.480 --> 03:28:55.720]  check out that they just flashed it on the screen that great report uh by edited by josh i think
[03:28:55.720 --> 03:29:01.000]  it's called the clinton chronicles 2015 yes there it is you guys can check that out on info wars
[03:29:01.000 --> 03:29:06.040]  dot com it's also on the alex jones channel on youtube and as we were talking about earlier
[03:29:06.040 --> 03:29:12.760]  report advisory told biden clinton war machine will destroy you so i mean there's a lot of reasons
[03:29:12.760 --> 03:29:16.680]  why biden isn't going to run of course you know his son died recently and i do give him
[03:29:16.680 --> 03:29:22.120]  my condolences on that but as i said earlier his actions within the obama campaign do not
[03:29:22.120 --> 03:29:27.240]  give me a great deal of confidence but i can say that about the majority of the people who are running
[03:29:28.200 --> 03:29:33.320]  right now in republicans or democrats and of course they're libertarians other people as well
[03:29:33.320 --> 03:29:37.320]  we want to get into the mix but that's what we're dealing with right now so stay tuned

[03:29:59.560 --> 03:30:04.200]  less than a week after the overnight upgrade to tesla cars making them capable of autonomous
[03:30:04.200 --> 03:30:10.200]  driving multiple videos have surfaced of the cars trying to throw their human drivers under the bus
[03:30:10.200 --> 03:30:15.800]  literally in one video the car begins beeping as another car approaches then rapidly swerves into
[03:30:15.800 --> 03:30:20.360]  what would have been a head-on collision if the driver hadn't reacted quickly to jerk the wheel
[03:30:20.360 --> 03:30:26.840]  back to the right tesla says auto steers just a beta release if you use it and your car crashes
[03:30:26.840 --> 03:30:31.800]  they deny all responsibility releasing buggy software that causes your computer to crash
[03:30:31.800 --> 03:30:37.400]  is far different than releasing buggy software that can crash your car with you in it and kill
[03:30:37.400 --> 03:30:42.520]  other people on the highway and ask yourself why would the government that normally is fanatic
[03:30:42.520 --> 03:30:48.760]  about safety allow this on the road because nothing is more important for them than to

[03:33:17.160 --> 03:33:22.600]  is michael cargill of central texas gunworks how you doing mike outstanding outstanding all right
[03:33:22.600 --> 03:33:26.680]  so we're going to talk about a whole lot of news but first i want to go ahead and give that call
[03:33:26.680 --> 03:33:37.160]  out number it is 1 800 259 9231 once again the number to call in is 1 800 259 9231 and mike's
[03:33:37.160 --> 03:33:41.320]  going to take your questions on all manner of second amendment news and whatever questions you
[03:33:41.320 --> 03:33:45.240]  have just to keep yourself safe now mike there's a lot of stuff we have and we can't get through it
[03:33:45.240 --> 03:33:48.680]  all but i know there's a few things that are near and dear to your heart you walked in you saw this
[03:33:48.680 --> 03:33:54.520]  article i have here bill introduced to remove suppressors from nfa regulation yes the hearing
[03:33:54.520 --> 03:34:00.360]  protection act i really like this bill because when they enacted when we first got our nfa
[03:34:00.360 --> 03:34:04.520]  process and all that stuff started they added suppressors later on down the road to that
[03:34:04.520 --> 03:34:10.120]  list and suppressors never should have been added to the nfa process because you know if you if you
[03:34:10.120 --> 03:34:17.240]  think about osha and if we allow you know we we do a lot of things you know with with shooting we do
[03:34:17.240 --> 03:34:21.080]  a lot of things with other things where osha comes into play in the workplace they say you know this
[03:34:21.080 --> 03:34:27.400]  is too loud you need to have hearing protection for this well if osha was actually you know came
[03:34:27.400 --> 03:34:34.120]  about now when suppressors came about we would actually make suppressors legal so we need to
[03:34:34.120 --> 03:34:38.840]  bring this you know bring this back to the forefront we can actually you know start using
[03:34:38.840 --> 03:34:42.680]  suppressors in our firearms it's just a lot safer that way and it's a lot quieter that way
[03:34:42.680 --> 03:34:48.440]  um and i encourage people to try to dab into figuring out how to go about getting you know
[03:34:48.440 --> 03:34:53.800]  an nfa item if you want to get our automatic rifle you want to get um you want to get a machine gun
[03:34:53.800 --> 03:34:59.720]  you want to get a sbr or something like that go ahead and and see about you know filling out that
[03:34:59.720 --> 03:35:05.080]  paperwork and getting that those items because those are great firearms to shoot now because
[03:35:05.640 --> 03:35:09.320]  oh well i was gonna i wasn't gonna say the name but everybody's gonna know who i'm talking about
[03:35:09.320 --> 03:35:13.640]  myself and joe viggs i'll say you're like one of the guys who worked here but uh myself and joe
[03:35:13.640 --> 03:35:17.720]  viggs were talking about maybe getting something like a trust yes so tell us what that process
[03:35:17.720 --> 03:35:21.480]  would be like all right so what you do is there's a form you have to fill out with the atf it's a
[03:35:21.480 --> 03:35:26.600]  form for and you're going to fill that form out there's a $200 tax fee a tax stamp fee that you
[03:35:26.600 --> 03:35:31.960]  have to pay the atf and then the best way to do it is to do a trust that way you can name a bunch
[03:35:31.960 --> 03:35:36.520]  of different people on that trust because what happens is if you actually go to the chief law
[03:35:36.520 --> 03:35:40.600]  enforcement officer in the county that you live in have them sign off on it gets your picture taking
[03:35:40.600 --> 03:35:46.600]  your and your photo and your fingerprints done and you die then that item gets destroyed or if
[03:35:46.600 --> 03:35:52.440]  you only name one person in the trust yourself once you die that item is destroyed but if you name
[03:35:52.440 --> 03:35:57.960]  several people in the trust then that item can pass to those individuals you know if something
[03:35:57.960 --> 03:36:02.360]  actually happened to you so it's it's better to actually have a trust that way you can have a group
[03:36:02.360 --> 03:36:07.960]  of people five or ten people the entire family can have access to this NFA item and the way that
[03:36:07.960 --> 03:36:13.320]  works is whoever goes into the gun store to pick it up that person has to get the background check
[03:36:13.320 --> 03:36:18.840]  done okay so it's just one person right okay sounds sounds very good let's keep moving through our
[03:36:18.840 --> 03:36:24.920]  stack here we have this la city council moles gunlock law now mike the thing that concerns me
[03:36:24.920 --> 03:36:32.040]  about this they said that they want the guns to be disabled and locked that's in your first
[03:36:32.040 --> 03:36:37.960]  paragraph there it says handguns not in use have to be disabled and locked in a secure container
[03:36:37.960 --> 03:36:43.560]  under the threat of a $1,000 fine do you see any issues with that man that that's just insane to
[03:36:43.560 --> 03:36:47.480]  me i don't know what what goes on in california in their head and that's why a lot of people
[03:36:47.480 --> 03:36:50.920]  actually leave in that state and they keep coming here and trying to change everything do not come
[03:36:50.920 --> 03:36:54.920]  to texas you know texas if you want to i mean you can come here if you want but don't come here
[03:36:54.920 --> 03:36:58.600]  and try to make it like california that you just left no sir we're full we're not taking anymore
[03:36:58.600 --> 03:37:02.920]  from california so because you you've already screwed up your state now you want to come here
[03:37:02.920 --> 03:37:07.880]  and screw up texas and everywhere else in in this country um i totally disagree with this you know
[03:37:07.880 --> 03:37:12.360]  you need to be able to have access to your firearm what if my loved one someone in my family something
[03:37:12.360 --> 03:37:16.360]  has happened inside my home and they need to get access to my firearm to protect themselves i don't
[03:37:16.360 --> 03:37:20.120]  want them to have to worry about going through all these different little silly steps you know
[03:37:20.120 --> 03:37:24.600]  and then also you know anywhere else you know in the school anywhere else you know somebody should
[03:37:24.600 --> 03:37:28.120]  be able to get access to that firearm so they can stop that threat that's what it's all about it's
[03:37:28.120 --> 03:37:33.400]  about saving lives and they're trying to add little um little stumps in that you know in that
[03:37:33.400 --> 03:37:37.800]  phase there to prevent you from saving your life or someone else's life yeah because i talked to
[03:37:37.800 --> 03:37:44.040]  david tweet uh was it herald isd in north texas when i first started working here and they have
[03:37:44.040 --> 03:37:49.320]  the teachers carry concealed in the school and he said we have to do this because it takes 20 minutes
[03:37:49.320 --> 03:37:53.400]  for a sheriff or a deputy to get out here that's not even the swat team that's just for one guy
[03:37:53.400 --> 03:37:57.240]  to get out there so they have to have the means to protect themselves in the case if something
[03:37:57.240 --> 03:38:02.440]  happened and they did it all the way as far back as 2007 they've allowed in its herald isd you got
[03:38:02.440 --> 03:38:07.400]  that exactly right they allowed uh the principal and the teachers to carry inside the school
[03:38:07.400 --> 03:38:11.320]  and for that exact reason because the the closest police department is way too far away
[03:38:11.320 --> 03:38:16.280]  and if something was to happen it is up to the teachers and the principal to defend that school
[03:38:16.280 --> 03:38:20.840]  for any intruders or or anything like that and they haven't had any problems at all whatsoever
[03:38:20.840 --> 03:38:25.240]  they have they have an outstanding program and they they're telling everyone hey mind your own
[03:38:25.240 --> 03:38:28.760]  business don't worry about what we're doing here because we're doing it right yeah and and if i
[03:38:28.760 --> 03:38:32.680]  recall they said they have to qualify like every week they go out to the range once a month or
[03:38:32.680 --> 03:38:37.320]  or something like that so absolutely wonderful program and all schools need to you know should
[03:38:37.320 --> 03:38:41.960]  follow suit to protect we need to protect the kids and this is a way to do it now we got one here
[03:38:41.960 --> 03:38:47.480]  that i know is very important to you we have a jury gun shop that sold weapon used to shoot
[03:38:47.480 --> 03:38:54.600]  wound Milwaukee cops must pay nearly six million dollars and this is badger guns in Milwaukee
[03:38:54.600 --> 03:38:59.240]  so when you see this Michael when you see that they're ordering the gun shop to pay the money
[03:38:59.240 --> 03:39:03.800]  what is that spark in your mind well the first thing i thought of let's look into badger guns
[03:39:03.800 --> 03:39:08.040]  and see what's going on there and so when i delved into it a little bit i figured out that
[03:39:08.040 --> 03:39:17.960]  badger guns between 2006 and 2009 they had 1800 firearms were used in a crime 1800 1800 guns that
[03:39:17.960 --> 03:39:23.720]  they sold had been used in a crime per the Milwaukee police department in a three-year period
[03:39:23.720 --> 03:39:29.080]  so this gun store is a problem this is not a i got your moment for the anti-gun community to you
[03:39:29.080 --> 03:39:33.640]  know to come on us with you know it's not an i got your moment this gun store is a problem
[03:39:33.640 --> 03:39:37.400]  and they're they're not doing it right and so it was only a matter of time and this is not just
[03:39:37.400 --> 03:39:42.040]  the first lawsuit they're more than one lawsuit that's involved with this gun store and they're
[03:39:42.040 --> 03:39:46.520]  now it's under a totally different name so they're even they're closed now it's it's under new
[03:39:46.520 --> 03:39:51.160]  ownership now now as far as they are not doing things right you know what do you think maybe
[03:39:51.160 --> 03:39:56.280]  could have been done differently absolutely well one you need to know your customer if a person
[03:39:56.280 --> 03:40:00.840]  walks into the gun store they don't feel that form out right then you stop it right there it's done
[03:40:00.840 --> 03:40:04.920]  you know you you can't even feel the form out correctly then there's no cell there you know
[03:40:04.920 --> 03:40:10.600]  you know what's going on but then there's a fine line there you know of holding someone responsible
[03:40:10.600 --> 03:40:16.040]  because there's a fine line we're talking about a straw purchase you have to clearly know that
[03:40:16.040 --> 03:40:21.000]  this person is buying the gun for someone else because they can't buy the gun that's a lot of
[03:40:21.000 --> 03:40:25.720]  times that's hard to figure out it's hard for me as a gun store owner to know if someone's doing
[03:40:25.720 --> 03:40:30.840]  a straw purchase if they hide that information from me i'm not going to know so we can't hold them
[03:40:31.480 --> 03:40:35.400]  you know there's like i said there's a fine line there of holding them responsible
[03:40:35.960 --> 03:40:44.280]  when it comes to certain things very good very good once again the number to call in is 1-800-259-9231
[03:40:44.280 --> 03:40:50.520]  1-800-259-9231 now i've been asking the questions here mike and i know you've got a lot of things
[03:40:50.520 --> 03:40:56.520]  on your mind on your plate so you know what's hot in your mind well one um we need to do something
[03:40:56.520 --> 03:41:00.680]  people need to get involved with this presidential race because we've already heard from the democrats
[03:41:00.680 --> 03:41:05.640]  that they're coming after the second amendment and they're going to do something this time around
[03:41:05.640 --> 03:41:10.680]  and we really need to stand up and stop them from getting into office we need to lean libertarian
[03:41:10.680 --> 03:41:15.320]  leave republican out of care do not lean to democrat way because we got to stop them there
[03:41:15.320 --> 03:41:20.920]  and they're coming at us by using these terms of you know racism like in texas they're you know
[03:41:20.920 --> 03:41:25.960]  everything's a racist thing now oh it's just races everything's racist oh yeah owning a firearm is
[03:41:25.960 --> 03:41:31.000]  racist nothing was it the la times put that out yes as everyone's using that you know you have
[03:41:31.000 --> 03:41:36.360]  university of texas their students they're talking about uh the concealed handgun license it's it's
[03:41:36.360 --> 03:41:44.520]  racist because um it's too hard for blacks to own guns and get you on a gun michael cargill
[03:41:44.520 --> 03:41:50.280]  yes i own a gun good lord we ran into that me and viggs were in ferguson and we were talking to a
[03:41:50.280 --> 03:41:55.880]  guy who will go unnamed and he is a black guy and he's talking about you know all the open carriers
[03:41:55.880 --> 03:42:00.440]  and their racists and all this and that and i said you can go buy a gun just like i can he's like okay
[03:42:00.440 --> 03:42:04.120]  i was like okay that's your argument you can go buy a gun can you not probably already has one
[03:42:04.120 --> 03:42:08.680]  yeah it's just completely ridiculous oh definitely so you know they're using these
[03:42:08.680 --> 03:42:12.360]  little weak little arguments and we need to stop them from using all these little silly
[03:42:12.360 --> 03:42:16.520]  arguments of racism and everything else because it has nothing to do with race this is about a
[03:42:16.520 --> 03:42:20.920]  person's individual their right to be able to protect themselves the forefathers the one thing
[03:42:20.920 --> 03:42:25.640]  that they did was they said you know what let's do the first amendment the first amendment says hey
[03:42:25.640 --> 03:42:30.680]  you know you are guaranteed the right to say what you want to say and they say you know what let's come
[03:42:30.680 --> 03:42:34.920]  up with the second amendment the second is you know what you can back that up with a gun and
[03:42:34.920 --> 03:42:38.520]  that's why it's the second amendment and it protects everything else it's not called the
[03:42:38.520 --> 03:42:42.600]  bill of needs it's called the bill of rights i like that it's not the bill of needs it's the
[03:42:42.600 --> 03:42:46.440]  bill of rights now we're talking a little bit earlier about the presidential candidates is
[03:42:46.440 --> 03:42:50.760]  there anybody who sticks out in your mind particularly as when it comes to the second amendment
[03:42:51.720 --> 03:42:56.680]  well i you know i i hope that a libertarian candidate steps up you know that's where i would i
[03:42:56.680 --> 03:43:03.640]  would rather lean um i don't it's hard to tell and then the republican field who's gonna stand out
[03:43:03.640 --> 03:43:08.600]  just yet so we'll see what happens there but um we need to we need to protect our second amendment
[03:43:08.600 --> 03:43:13.000]  because it will protect everything else and so all right that's a very good answer and i wouldn't
[03:43:13.000 --> 03:43:17.480]  mind seeing a libertarian myself we just have to wait for that to come up absolutely let's go to
[03:43:17.480 --> 03:43:24.040]  some calls now we have bubba in virginia go ahead bubba hey thanks they were called sorry
[03:43:24.040 --> 03:43:31.320]  hey i have a question and kind of an issue uh how is it that a department of defense
[03:43:31.320 --> 03:43:36.440]  directed can you serve the constitution i need a second amendment by that i mean
[03:43:37.800 --> 03:43:44.120]  he was uh i believe it's under bush won that that's in his term the uh i believe his name is at
[03:43:44.120 --> 03:43:49.800]  wood he was the uh secretary of defense at that time he was under secretary of defense he was
[03:43:49.800 --> 03:43:54.440]  he signed the dod director basically stating that the only time you can bring a gun onto a military
[03:43:54.440 --> 03:44:01.640]  installation is if it's part of your duties i.e. if you're military police right well by doing that
[03:44:01.640 --> 03:44:05.880]  everyone else that works on that installation these you serve their constitutional rights you
[03:44:05.880 --> 03:44:10.760]  serve their second amendment and not only i'll be doing it while they're on base so for example
[03:44:11.640 --> 03:44:19.000]  i'll speak to myself if you work on base you cannot keep your guns to work so you can't have
[03:44:19.000 --> 03:44:22.920]  a parking lot you can't have it anywhere so from the time you leave your dome it's also time you
[03:44:22.920 --> 03:44:28.680]  return there you're serving your constitutional rights and it can change you can't have a gun
[03:44:28.680 --> 03:44:34.120]  on our army base do this stuff up and you know what and i agree with you 100% you know we need to
[03:44:34.120 --> 03:44:39.560]  get back to look if they trust you as a as a soldier you know i serve 12 years of the united
[03:44:39.560 --> 03:44:44.520]  states army you know if i can travel around the country around the world and defend this country
[03:44:44.520 --> 03:44:50.360]  there should be no reason why i should not be able to defend myself while i'm back home you know
[03:44:50.360 --> 03:44:53.720]  while i'm traveling to and from work and everywhere else you know all of a sudden when i cross the
[03:44:53.720 --> 03:44:59.000]  threshold of that of that base i'm not just i'm not gonna all of a sudden not be trusted you know
[03:44:59.000 --> 03:45:03.560]  i'm a soldier you've trained me then i should be able to protect myself just like i protect this
[03:45:03.560 --> 03:45:09.240]  country so i agree with you 100% well thank you so much bubba we're gonna move on now to christian
[03:45:09.240 --> 03:45:19.960]  in california go ahead christian thank you thank you yeah my question is uh what are your views on
[03:45:19.960 --> 03:45:30.440]  police officers carrying a bigger arm like machine gun uh well it's not in mexico i mean i don't have
[03:45:30.440 --> 03:45:35.080]  an issue with police being armed but the issue is is they always want to be armed not have you be
[03:45:35.080 --> 03:45:39.400]  armed just like you know ferguson was example we had the guys who were willing to come out and
[03:45:40.360 --> 03:45:45.880]  spare their time to watch out for me and joe bigs had we been there back in was it august or
[03:45:45.880 --> 03:45:50.920]  september the first time we originally went or not not august september is november when we're
[03:45:50.920 --> 03:45:54.920]  the full ride was there they're burning down buildings and there are swat teams protecting
[03:45:54.920 --> 03:45:59.560]  the police station i mean like when it came down to it the police were protecting the police
[03:45:59.560 --> 03:46:03.560]  it was like you can go down there if you want to you may not come back and beyond that they weren't
[03:46:03.560 --> 03:46:08.840]  just protecting us as journalists they were failing to protect the firefighters so you know
[03:46:08.840 --> 03:46:14.040]  if if i if they want to have the guns to arm themselves i want to have the same arms as well
[03:46:14.040 --> 03:46:18.600]  go ahead microcard you're right you know if they want to carry they can pack all they want to just
[03:46:18.600 --> 03:46:23.640]  don't come to me or come to my house and tell me i can't have something you know if i want i want to
[03:46:23.640 --> 03:46:28.120]  have a automatic i want to have a semi-automatic don't come to my house and and try to confiscate
[03:46:28.120 --> 03:46:32.120]  my firearms for me so i should be able to carry just like you can carry and i should be to carry
[03:46:32.120 --> 03:46:36.440]  the same thing you can carry i agree with that if they can pack it you know i can pack it too thank
[03:46:36.440 --> 03:46:41.080]  you so much christian we're going to move on now to anthony and florida go ahead anthony
[03:46:42.760 --> 03:46:48.680]  hello yes um i'd like uh i'd like to thank you that i was looking at that article um
[03:46:48.680 --> 03:46:54.920]  your you showed about california having a lot a lot on the gun or something yes and you know i
[03:46:54.920 --> 03:47:00.200]  think to myself it's just total that is a stupid because what if somebody decides to go on a stabbing
[03:47:00.200 --> 03:47:04.920]  rampage what are they going to do well you know about well we see that just like i always bring
[03:47:04.920 --> 03:47:09.480]  up the case of elliot roger in california the young man who you know said you know he wouldn't
[03:47:09.480 --> 03:47:14.040]  get enough booty so he's gonna go out and kill a bunch of people he shot people he stabbed people
[03:47:14.040 --> 03:47:18.760]  he ran people over this car nobody called for knife control nobody called for car control
[03:47:18.760 --> 03:47:25.160]  it was always the guns like it normally is go ahead anthony i totally agree with you on that
[03:47:25.160 --> 03:47:30.520]  scenario thanks thank you mike do you have awesome no you hit the nail right on the head there
[03:47:30.520 --> 03:47:34.840]  oh because i tell you they come out you know someone will adjust the uh yesterday someone
[03:47:34.840 --> 03:47:38.360]  came out and stabbed someone just this morning there was a stabbing this morning a teacher
[03:47:38.360 --> 03:47:42.920]  was stabbed and killed uh they they're not they're not blaming that knife they're not blaming you
[03:47:42.920 --> 03:47:46.440]  know they need to they're blaming the individual but they should do that the same thing when their
[03:47:46.440 --> 03:47:50.840]  gun is involved don't blame the gun blame the crazy yeah there was a video i don't know if it's
[03:47:50.840 --> 03:47:55.880]  still on drudge but there's a video yesterday of some guy i think in california swinging a machete
[03:47:55.880 --> 03:48:00.120]  in somewhere california i believe and basically it was a guy i don't i don't know the exact
[03:48:00.120 --> 03:48:04.680]  circumstance or you know what drove him to the situation but he's out there swinging machete
[03:48:04.680 --> 03:48:09.000]  at a car so he's hitting the car with the machete and then the car runs him over oh so you have a
[03:48:09.000 --> 03:48:13.480]  situation involving a machete in the car nobody's calling for machete or car control right right
[03:48:13.480 --> 03:48:18.520]  but had that guy had a had he had a BB gun to shout out somebody's window oh man oh take the gun

[03:49:17.640 --> 03:49:23.160]  they can go ahead on youtube and uh okay real thank you real quick give us uh your question or comment
[03:49:25.080 --> 03:49:33.800]  i want to know how what is the cost to implement a uh like uh to take the guns away from the american
[03:49:33.800 --> 03:49:41.480]  people how how many millions of dollars estimate would it cost to to do that there's 300 million
[03:49:41.480 --> 03:49:48.440]  guns in the united states alone so they got to have some kind of way to finance it to take the
[03:49:48.440 --> 03:49:53.560]  guns away and take the people to go out and take the guns from the american people and i don't
[03:49:54.520 --> 03:49:59.720]  see how that could be financially uh sustained it's good it's like it's like the visa the
[03:49:59.720 --> 03:50:04.520]  mastic art commercial is priceless you know there's no way to tell it uh it's it's going to cost too
[03:50:04.520 --> 03:50:08.760]  much you're not going to number one you're not going to be able to get the guns from everybody
[03:50:08.760 --> 03:50:13.640]  that's impossible is not going to happen one i'm not going to tell anyone how many guns i have
[03:50:13.640 --> 03:50:17.080]  two i'm not going to tell you where my guns are located so you're not they're not going to get them
[03:50:17.080 --> 03:50:21.800]  it's going to be an impossible task and you're going to wind up with more criminals having guns
[03:50:21.800 --> 03:50:25.960]  than law-abiding people because they're going to be disarmed because you're going to take the guns
[03:50:25.960 --> 03:50:31.400]  away so it's it's i wouldn't even go down that road to try to figure out what the cost is uh
[03:50:31.400 --> 03:50:36.520]  the cost is too great the cost is your freedom that is what the cost uh hello that's the cost
[03:50:36.520 --> 03:50:40.600]  is your freedom that's what it is because just like we saw in hurricane Katrina they always say
[03:50:40.600 --> 03:50:45.560]  there's never been door-to-door gun confiscation they did it in hurricane Katrina they at least
[03:50:45.560 --> 03:50:48.920]  have the infrastructure to do it they have the m-wraps and all the heavy armor and everything
[03:50:48.920 --> 03:50:53.000]  else if they wanted to do it are they going to do it how much would it cost i don't know stay tuned
[03:50:53.000 --> 03:50:56.760]  we'll be back right after this break with michael cargill of central texas gunworks

[03:55:27.480 --> 03:55:32.360]  stuff like that give we talk about the positive stuff that's happening around the country um
[03:55:33.080 --> 03:55:37.080]  with you know second amendment lovers and also i want to give a big shout out to those people
[03:55:37.080 --> 03:55:41.480]  in florida the florida i tell you they're pushing i can still carry on campus they're pushing open
[03:55:41.480 --> 03:55:46.440]  carry uh because we need we have five more states left that we're trying to get open carry pass in
[03:55:46.440 --> 03:55:50.760]  this country but we need to be able to carry our guns openly if we want to it's all about
[03:55:50.760 --> 03:55:54.840]  individuals right so we talk about all those things on the radio show as well and it's called
[03:55:54.840 --> 03:56:00.200]  come and talk it very good mike and talk about the open carry which you know personally you know
[03:56:00.200 --> 03:56:05.080]  even when it is law legal here in texas i'll probably seal carry concealed but you know if
[03:56:05.080 --> 03:56:08.840]  somebody wants to carry openly that's their business and that's the thing that everybody
[03:56:08.840 --> 03:56:12.360]  needs to understand because i always hear these people saying well if it's legal everybody's
[03:56:12.360 --> 03:56:16.520]  going to do it wow there's a whole state called oklahoma that debunks that that's where i'm from
[03:56:16.520 --> 03:56:21.320]  they passed it in 2013 every time i go home for christmas thanksgiving whatever i see like two or
[03:56:21.320 --> 03:56:26.120]  three people there are four other states that allow some form of uh open carry of a handgun
[03:56:26.120 --> 03:56:31.080]  texas will become the 45th state started jane where the first uh so you have stats that go
[03:56:31.080 --> 03:56:35.080]  that you can go through 44 different states to figure out you know what happened in those states
[03:56:35.080 --> 03:56:40.520]  it's not a big problem it's not a big deal this it will come it will go and i guarantee you the
[03:56:40.520 --> 03:56:44.600]  world will not end because of open carry it'll end because of something else now they're saying
[03:56:44.600 --> 03:56:48.920]  it's going to end because of campus carry what are your thoughts on that it's not going to end
[03:56:48.920 --> 03:56:53.640]  because of camp camp campus carry a person should be allowed to you know carry their handgun with
[03:56:53.640 --> 03:56:57.960]  a handgun license on a college campus just like they can carry everywhere else and all of a sudden
[03:56:57.960 --> 03:57:02.520]  going across that threshold of that college campus and go crazy you can carry in grocery stores
[03:57:02.520 --> 03:57:07.080]  you can carry in movie theaters you know malls the bank i can carry in public libraries i should
[03:57:07.080 --> 03:57:12.600]  be able to carry in those same facilities located on the college campus and it always amazes me with
[03:57:12.600 --> 03:57:16.200]  the rationale of people you know who are against things like that i mean you can be against it
[03:57:16.200 --> 03:57:20.280]  for all different reasons but i'll ask somebody well why don't you want to carry a gun because
[03:57:20.280 --> 03:57:23.880]  somebody's going to take it away from me i'm like okay so what are you going to do if like some guy
[03:57:23.880 --> 03:57:27.960]  tries to rape you i'm gonna call the police i'm like so this guy with the ninja skills that
[03:57:27.960 --> 03:57:31.560]  snaps a loaded gun out of your hand won't be able to take your phone away right and then you
[03:57:31.560 --> 03:57:35.480]  you have professors that are standing up saying i'm going to quit if camp is carried you know get
[03:57:35.480 --> 03:57:41.320]  the hell out exactly you know that ship has sailed all right your chance to to fight against this
[03:57:41.320 --> 03:57:46.920]  bill should have been last year it is now going to affect august 1st of 2016 in your colleges

[03:58:10.120 --> 03:58:14.120]  you can look at the fbi's own numbers you're much more likely to have your throat slit or be beaten
[03:58:14.120 --> 03:58:17.880]  over the head with a hammer than you are to be killed with a fully automatic rifle even though
[03:58:17.880 --> 03:58:21.880]  that's what they continue to demonize they don't want you to have even though the majority of what
[03:58:21.880 --> 03:58:26.040]  people can buy if they go to some big box store they're not even fully automatics right so people
