[00:00.000 --> 00:20.320]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the Alex Jones show okay
[00:20.320 --> 00:25.440]  I'm just gonna be completely frank with you I am so upset right now that I can't
[00:25.440 --> 00:31.160]  even do the show I'm learning to psychoanalyze myself and learn why I
[00:31.160 --> 00:33.720]  get upset so I don't have the angry outburst because they might be
[00:33.720 --> 00:39.600]  entertaining but they're real and they're not good for me there's also
[00:39.600 --> 00:43.480]  underlying frustration here that I do not have words to describe what's
[00:43.480 --> 00:52.120]  happening and it confirms our worst fears in triplicate and as a father I am
[00:52.120 --> 01:01.320]  having feelings of crystal pure rage where it's just totally clean and
[01:01.320 --> 01:13.400]  focused and my my very guts and my very brain cells my very heart just scream
[01:13.400 --> 01:19.360]  out at me defeat the enemy take them on because we are faced with some of the
[01:19.360 --> 01:28.240]  greatest evils of the most twisted evil this planet's ever seen and I just the
[01:28.240 --> 01:37.320]  first five minutes here I I don't even know what to say I'm totally focused on
[01:37.320 --> 01:48.120]  just stating the fact that I don't feel like I can give enough emphasis on how
[01:48.120 --> 01:52.040]  bad these globalists are and what they're doing and how they're pulling out
[01:52.040 --> 01:57.160]  the stops and the continuum of their lying and their deceit is going off the
[01:57.160 --> 02:04.800]  charts so fast with an exponential growth curve going straight up logarithmic
[02:04.800 --> 02:16.080]  would be the term that my physical body is now compensating and preparing for
[02:16.080 --> 02:20.400]  war I think that's the best way to describe this and I want to warn
[02:20.400 --> 02:24.360]  everybody out there about some none of you are gonna get out of this by sticking
[02:24.360 --> 02:28.240]  your heads in the sand or running away from it that's what's gonna make the
[02:28.240 --> 02:33.360]  fall of society happen faster and worse we could still have someone of a soft
[02:33.360 --> 02:38.760]  landing if people really get awake repent and get right with God and I
[02:38.760 --> 02:45.200]  don't say that from some high and mighty Pharisee type stance I say that from
[02:45.200 --> 02:50.080]  somebody who's a sinner and somebody that knows that I'm as wicked as the day is
[02:50.080 --> 02:56.080]  long but my heart and soul is pointed at God and I think that's really what I
[02:56.080 --> 03:02.280]  wanted to say at the start of the broadcast because in the final equation
[03:02.280 --> 03:14.000]  that's it it's the total realization the total realization that there really is
[03:14.000 --> 03:18.560]  a spiritual battle good and evil and that it's 100% real and we always knew
[03:18.560 --> 03:24.440]  it we've seen it and we've felt it but now it's so crystal clear and evil is
[03:24.440 --> 03:30.840]  taking the mask off everywhere and to just know that billions of people have
[03:30.840 --> 03:39.560]  signed on to a spirit of total destruction and that many of them know
[03:39.560 --> 03:44.600]  they've signed on to it and then if you go to a democratic party event old ladies
[03:44.600 --> 03:55.640]  and dresses and young men and old young they act demon possessed and you pull
[03:55.640 --> 03:59.120]  back from it you see the behavior you know a tree by its fruits and the
[03:59.120 --> 04:05.920]  things they're doing and you sit back and you go we're on a planet in deep
[04:05.920 --> 04:11.200]  space all these dimensions around us we even know where we came from or who we
[04:11.200 --> 04:15.760]  are except if you read the Bible that it's all crystal clear and it's all
[04:15.760 --> 04:22.840]  coming true and it's real it's unbelievable ladies and gentlemen there
[04:22.840 --> 04:28.200]  really is a Satan there really is a God we really are on a planet contending with

[06:10.760 --> 06:24.760]  it was about 2 30 in the morning last night I woke up and I couldn't go back
[06:24.760 --> 06:30.320]  to sleep I went in and got a glass of ice water nice slice of lemon thought
[06:30.320 --> 06:34.720]  about how amazing this planet is all the great things God's given us in the
[06:34.720 --> 06:40.840]  mystery of the universe I sat at the breakfast table for about three hours
[06:40.840 --> 06:50.000]  until my wife woke up and I just sat there thinking about the mystery and the
[06:50.000 --> 06:56.080]  magic and the world of wonder the universe of wonder all around us now we
[06:56.080 --> 07:03.320]  have this horrible political class especially here in the West that is
[07:03.320 --> 07:08.040]  attempting to literally destroy the family and put us on a collision course
[07:08.040 --> 07:17.720]  with Armageddon but any powerful rich amazing nation that dominates the planet
[07:17.720 --> 07:25.280]  is going to have the evil come to it and try to take over and so we should know
[07:25.280 --> 07:31.600]  that the whole world in our country is not as evil as Hollywood would make it
[07:31.600 --> 07:39.200]  look they just want us to give up they just want to demoralize us so that we
[07:39.200 --> 07:45.520]  just accept hundreds of articles a week now praising pedophilia and with known
[07:45.520 --> 07:51.560]  pedophile authors praising Desmond is amazing and drag Queen's children and
[07:51.560 --> 07:56.960]  saying how sexy they are how hot they are and how they want to you know have
[07:56.960 --> 08:03.480]  relations with them they're having so-called gay pride parades in New
[08:03.480 --> 08:07.920]  York in areas of Sweden and Europe that I haven't even covered because they're
[08:07.920 --> 08:13.560]  breaking our will they're doing it so much they're really pedophile pride
[08:13.560 --> 08:20.560]  parades where they have sex with 10 11 12 year old children in public and they
[08:20.560 --> 08:25.560]  do it in mass and the organizer does it and the police won't even arrest them
[08:25.560 --> 08:31.560]  now and you have these events with seven eight year old little boys twerking
[08:31.560 --> 08:42.040]  wearing Daisy Dukes and no shirt while fat men rub up against him and notice
[08:42.040 --> 08:46.400]  what the famous pedophile supporter said in the articles at the media praise
[08:46.400 --> 08:50.560]  last week I never even covered it I mentioned it he said look how vampiric
[08:50.560 --> 08:57.840]  Desmond is dressed look how sexy and hot he is and this is nothing of your TV
[08:57.840 --> 09:01.640]  viewer we're showing you Desmond being worshipped at a gay pride parade a
[09:01.640 --> 09:07.720]  pedophile parade but we can show you the little kids twerking half naked see I
[09:07.720 --> 09:10.800]  don't want to have to show you this but this is what children are being put
[09:10.800 --> 09:13.200]  through see if they can't abort them when they're in the womb or kill them
[09:13.200 --> 09:18.440]  after they're born or put them as much prozac or riddle on as they can or fry
[09:18.440 --> 09:25.640]  their brains with the cell phones they're gonna dump them straight in to a pit
[09:25.640 --> 09:33.920]  of perverts and like Desmond's head on a spike from a captured enemy or a
[09:33.920 --> 09:39.800]  captured standard we have your youth he goes on national TV shows with convicted
[09:39.800 --> 09:50.360]  murderers homosexual men who chopped up their lovers thought enough to bug chase
[09:50.360 --> 09:55.720]  and try to catch HIV now they're gonna bring our children down with them and
[09:55.720 --> 10:02.800]  there's never enough now what am I gonna start the main broadcast with today
[10:02.800 --> 10:08.800]  when we come back in the next segment there's a moment there's a time there's
[10:08.800 --> 10:15.920]  a space where everything crystallizes and you know that your worst concerns
[10:15.920 --> 10:24.640]  were accurate remember 25 years ago people say oh one day they're gonna ban
[10:24.640 --> 10:29.040]  the American flag and oh that'll never happen that's the crazy John Burt
[10:29.040 --> 10:36.240]  Society and then seven years ago the Ninth Circuit said you can ban the
[10:36.240 --> 10:42.160]  American flag from public schools and ban it's wearing because it's seen as a
[10:42.160 --> 10:47.880]  symbol of hate remember back at Charlottesville and they wanted to take
[10:47.880 --> 10:54.600]  down Thomas Jefferson statue great liberator the guy that tried to put it
[10:54.600 --> 10:58.600]  in the Constitution to free blacks then there'd be a civil war so it happened
[10:58.600 --> 11:05.400]  60 years later 70 years later he said you take down Thomas Jefferson next it
[11:05.400 --> 11:11.760]  will be take down the American flag hell they were already there and there's the
[11:11.760 --> 11:20.560]  headline at drudgereport.com gallop American pride hits new low and Nike
[11:20.560 --> 11:26.960]  pulls a designer shoe they put out that undoubtedly would have been a hit with
[11:26.960 --> 11:36.200]  the original 13-star continental army flag because Colin Kaepernick said it
[11:36.200 --> 11:39.960]  was offensive and hateful and of course they shipped out a thousand pairs of
[11:39.960 --> 11:44.080]  shoes and all this is an America hating stunt and you know what with
[11:44.080 --> 11:47.760]  millennials it paid off you'd think Colin Kaepernick being their spokesperson
[11:47.760 --> 11:54.920]  would hurt Nike sales it increased him 20 plus percent because only a loser would
[11:54.920 --> 12:00.440]  go buy $200 pair of America hating Colin Kaepernick shirts it may be a
[12:00.440 --> 12:06.360]  minority of schmucks that hate America like that but they're the type of
[12:06.360 --> 12:12.960]  schmucks that'll go by big ugly basketball or big ugly football shoes as a
[12:12.960 --> 12:25.880]  symbol of status think about that a man that hates this country a man that wants
[12:25.880 --> 12:30.840]  islamic jihad worldwide a man that got rich in this nation and was adopted by
[12:30.840 --> 12:36.760]  white parents and taken care of but see he's hired because shellacan valley and
[12:36.760 --> 12:42.840]  Nike and the globalist are inflicting this nation with a mortal wound a snake
[12:42.840 --> 12:51.880]  bite of civil war and racial division they now have national hit pieces in the
[12:51.880 --> 12:58.840]  New York Times and major publications running down Martin Luther King because
[12:58.840 --> 13:02.880]  he has to be destroyed because he said judge people by what they stand for and
[13:02.880 --> 13:07.000]  what they produce and by their fruits like Christ said you don't think Martin
[13:07.000 --> 13:17.440]  Luther King Jr. Dr. Martin Luther King invented that do you it just goes on and
[13:17.440 --> 13:25.840]  on ladies and gentlemen and so we come back we'll get into all of it Nike
[13:25.840 --> 13:31.480]  pulling American flag shoes I will never and I haven't worn Nike in a long time
[13:31.480 --> 13:36.280]  for their leftist garbage but they they're more inexpensive running shoes
[13:36.280 --> 13:42.280]  and things are decent they're low-key you know I can go buy them an academy for
[13:42.280 --> 13:48.280]  40 bucks last year's style I always see poor kids at the mall drooling over
[13:48.280 --> 13:53.760]  $300 sneakers see that's what Colin Capric does is he shells to little
[13:53.760 --> 13:57.920]  white kids and little black kids racial division but oak at the Colin Capric
[13:57.920 --> 14:03.240]  means you're cool spent $200 $300 on him on his shoes while he gets rich off
[14:03.240 --> 14:10.720]  you well he gets up to $10 per pair of shoes off division
[14:11.000 --> 14:17.520]  Nike Nix's Betsy Ross flag sneaker after Colin Kaepernick intervenes oh
[14:17.520 --> 14:27.040]  Colin Kaepernick the NFL has 40% down its ratings that's what the general
[14:27.040 --> 14:30.920]  public's not putting up with it and tuning out they're losing but but but
[14:30.920 --> 14:37.680]  billions but still they push the hate of America because they're owned by the
[14:37.680 --> 14:43.240]  globalist and they're inflicting a mortal wound on the nation so anyone
[14:43.240 --> 14:46.440]  that ever doubted who these people are you now have it all in your face I'm
[14:46.440 --> 14:51.040]  gonna come back into all of it AOC has gone beyond Jesse Smollett and claim
[14:51.040 --> 14:54.760]  that she was sexually assaulted by the board patrol even CNN wouldn't get the
[14:54.760 --> 14:58.320]  actual quotes off her Twitter they're like God she jumped the shark there's
[14:58.320 --> 15:02.400]  footage in the whole facility turned out she was actually screaming at people

[15:07.240 --> 15:10.320]  said she saw women drinking out of toilets now she says oh she heard that
[15:10.320 --> 15:22.120]  she is a damn lying witch that's all coming up but you got to understand folks
[15:22.120 --> 15:26.640]  if she says the board patrol sexually assaulted her and made women drink out
[15:26.640 --> 15:32.920]  of toilets and they said I'm sitting out child porn when I'm not and she says
[15:32.920 --> 15:41.400]  the world's gonna in 12 years they'll do anything and these globalists say we're
[15:41.400 --> 15:45.200]  not gonna sell products with American flags on them and you'll wonder who the
[15:45.200 --> 15:49.200]  enemy is all of its true the world government everything and remember

[18:02.920 --> 18:07.000]  hey yeah I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air I talked to a lot
[18:07.000 --> 18:10.360]  of people here out in New York City and one thing I can tell you is that almost
[18:10.360 --> 18:14.560]  nobody agrees with these wars I think that the neocons are trying desperately
[18:14.560 --> 18:18.520]  to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they
[18:18.520 --> 18:22.280]  could defeat him in the eyes of the public the approaching 2020 that's it
[18:22.280 --> 18:25.520]  I mean if Trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's the only
[18:25.520 --> 18:28.360]  way I think he could be defeated other than assassinating him it's a time to
[18:28.360 --> 18:31.160]  be praying my friend I agree entirely and the last thing I just want to say
[18:31.160 --> 18:34.640]  Alex is I know they're trying to shut you down but the reinforcements have
[18:34.640 --> 18:38.680]  arrived man I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old I'd love
[18:38.680 --> 18:41.720]  to see what you're talking about when you're 80 but if they do shut you down
[18:41.720 --> 18:46.680]  no you've gone into this war you've won a lot of battles and there are a lot of
[18:46.680 --> 18:50.280]  people like myself and many others who are gonna continue we're gonna keep
[18:50.280 --> 18:53.520]  fighting in the input war and even if something does happen to you or your
[18:53.520 --> 18:58.200]  show know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty thank

[20:30.480 --> 20:40.680]  birthday. Democrat operatives on multinational and Chycom funding are
[20:40.680 --> 20:45.480]  openly calling for physical revolutions Joe Biden for the forced violent
[20:45.480 --> 20:53.520]  taking of wealth from some to others. Mayor of New York City Council members
[20:53.520 --> 20:56.960]  and places like Denver are saying it's time to have a violent revolution and a
[20:56.960 --> 21:02.520]  communist overthrow of the government. AOC to wipe the fires because the world's
[21:02.520 --> 21:07.680]  ending in 12 years and that emergency centers with the hundreds of thousands
[21:07.680 --> 21:11.440]  pouring into the US every month where we find out who folks are get the medical
[21:11.440 --> 21:14.720]  treatment and then let them into the country most open borders in the world.
[21:14.720 --> 21:19.280]  She says those are constant tracing camps and goes to stages fake photo ops
[21:19.280 --> 21:23.080]  since she saw children in cages when that was Obama that put them behind
[21:23.080 --> 21:32.360]  chain link fences and now AOC went to the Texas border again got a tour of the
[21:32.360 --> 21:35.640]  facility because the board patrols like wait a minute we give you a tour any
[21:35.640 --> 21:41.920]  time come see and she blew up at them she said how dare you try to take selfies
[21:41.920 --> 21:48.480]  with me she began screaming and everyone had a total freakout this has all been
[21:48.480 --> 21:52.520]  confirmed reportedly the board patrols get ready to release the footage because
[21:52.520 --> 21:55.920]  she came out in line and said that she felt sexually threatened she felt
[21:55.920 --> 22:01.440]  physically threatened that they were visually assaulting her and that she
[22:01.440 --> 22:06.960]  saw women drinking out of toilets she tweeted all this and her other
[22:06.960 --> 22:11.320]  Democratic Party members said they saw this and then Hispanics from the local
[22:11.320 --> 22:17.000]  town whose families work there and the board patrol in Texas is about 65%
[22:17.000 --> 22:20.840]  Hispanic they showed up in a 30-minute press conference as posted on info wars
[22:20.840 --> 22:26.560]  dot com and shut them down the Islamists and and all the rest of them up
[22:26.560 --> 22:34.120]  there the Democrats lying and they said liar you're lying none of that's true
[22:34.120 --> 22:39.560]  no one's drinking out of toilets all of it completely made up ladies and
[22:39.560 --> 22:44.080]  gentlemen because there is no bottom to the Democratic Party they've green-
[22:44.080 --> 22:49.800]  lighted complete lying the Wall Street Journal the AP ran headlines last week
[22:49.800 --> 22:53.880]  saying Alex Jones lost a lawsuit in Sandy Hook for a book he wrote nobody
[22:53.880 --> 22:59.920]  died at Sandy Hook and the article has nothing to do with me I never wrote the
[22:59.920 --> 23:04.640]  book never read the book not in the book and we talked to AP and they said go
[23:04.640 --> 23:09.040]  ahead and sue us we stand by it that's because they think there won't be court
[23:09.040 --> 23:14.680]  cases in a year or two they plan a violent overthrow AP nationwide and the
[23:14.680 --> 23:21.640]  Wall Street Journal said things 100% false and when respected law firms I had
[23:21.640 --> 23:25.640]  two different ones send them letters and call them the mid-levels went you're
[23:25.640 --> 23:29.040]  right we'll get this change let's talk to our topic they came back said we got
[23:29.040 --> 23:35.840]  letters from BuzzFeed saying we stand behind all this I'll win lawsuits open
[23:35.840 --> 23:42.720]  and shut it'll take years they know that's not gonna be here in years they
[23:42.720 --> 23:49.280]  just pulled a stunt Nike did sitting out a thousand pairs of the first
[23:49.280 --> 23:53.960]  installment of red white and blue tennis shoes made a Chinese slave camp no
[23:53.960 --> 24:01.320]  doubt and they pulled it and made a big press announcement because Colin
[24:01.320 --> 24:09.880]  Kaepernick said so on the 4th of July saying the American flag is offensive
[24:09.880 --> 24:21.360]  and racist and bad and again you thought that they would lose money when
[24:21.360 --> 24:25.360]  Colin Kaepernick became their main spokesman no because it's the schmucks
[24:25.360 --> 24:30.560]  but again will buy $300 tennis shoes $200 tennis shoes with Kaepernick on it
[24:30.560 --> 24:37.000]  for the icon of hating America foreign multinational corporations publicly
[24:37.000 --> 24:40.160]  aided by the Chinese government it's the biggest owner of our debt the biggest
[24:40.160 --> 24:45.880]  owner of stock in the big six production companies in Hollywood you turn on
[24:45.880 --> 24:51.160]  Netflix you turn on it's America hating you turn on CNN MSNBC it is
[24:51.160 --> 24:59.280]  incredible and Antifa wants massive acid attacks and steel bar attacks
[24:59.280 --> 25:04.440]  viciously injuring many people hurting their eyesight almost blinding people and
[25:04.440 --> 25:08.240]  the police defended it in Portland the mayor defended it seeing in the
[25:08.240 --> 25:12.800]  Huffington Post are now defending it we play clips with her say on MSNBC well
[25:12.800 --> 25:17.680]  it's like radiation treatment we've got to teach you racist we say you're bad so
[25:17.680 --> 25:21.200]  you deserve it even if you were racist you don't deserve that hell the racist
[25:21.200 --> 25:26.280]  are the left using race-based politics this is an uprising and they're
[25:26.280 --> 25:30.480]  incrementally turning it up thinking Trump won't act law enforcement won't act
[25:30.480 --> 25:36.920]  the public won't act until they hit us with a full overthrow last one that you
[25:36.920 --> 25:41.160]  lie Antifa was planning a violent overthrow of Trump but a lot of them
[25:41.160 --> 25:44.000]  got arrested a lot of them got rolled up a lot of them got caught planning
[25:44.000 --> 25:48.800]  acid attacks did you a lot of press coverage this year they've said it again
[25:48.800 --> 25:55.440]  acid attacks in Austin Texas in Washington DC in San Francisco they're
[25:55.440 --> 26:02.720]  saying anyone attempting to celebrate this nation's birth will be clubbed in
[26:02.720 --> 26:06.400]  the head you better not come out to those fourth of July rallies they are
[26:06.400 --> 26:12.440]  teaching you they are showing you and I know reporters on this office but others
[26:12.440 --> 26:18.520]  that won't go to the fourth of July in DC because they know Antifa will be
[26:18.520 --> 26:24.000]  waiting outside the gates and Trump still doesn't control the DC police and
[26:24.000 --> 26:26.840]  just like when I tried to go to the inauguration two and a half years ago
[26:26.840 --> 26:30.960]  they will physically attack men women and children they will break your wife's
[26:30.960 --> 26:35.760]  nose and the police will only intervene if you strike back at the God at the
[26:35.760 --> 26:42.960]  meth head government employee wearing a black mask it's on ladies and gentlemen
[26:42.960 --> 26:46.680]  they think you're weak they think you're gonna roll over and Nike says the
[26:46.680 --> 26:51.080]  American flag is bad and they are betting on the millennials to have
[26:51.080 --> 26:59.640]  political orgasms over those filthy shoes they think you're done because you
[26:59.640 --> 27:02.840]  already let them abort kids after they're born we've already got designer
[27:02.840 --> 27:08.000]  babies with five parents we've already got clone humans now AP says oh they've
[27:08.000 --> 27:14.600]  been getting born in China for years oh sure not here right the sky is the limit
[27:14.600 --> 27:18.600]  let's go out to break with a clip of no borders no walls no USA at all this is
[27:18.600 --> 27:21.480]  shit everywhere and you saw it on the stage with the Democrats saying the
[27:21.480 --> 27:28.880]  same thing last week and then of course the governor in New York says America
[27:28.880 --> 27:58.720]  sucks here it is

[32:05.640 --> 32:10.040]  unique about info wars is it isn't the only network of this reach that is not
[32:10.040 --> 32:13.760]  backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy that's not backed by some
[32:13.760 --> 32:17.120]  billionaire that's not being funded by secrets foreign government it is
[32:17.120 --> 32:21.920]  completely independent of all that it is an old-school American 1776 style
[32:21.920 --> 32:25.280]  experiment in the expression of the freedom of press and freedom of speech
[32:25.280 --> 32:28.400]  that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the
[32:28.400 --> 32:32.280]  country they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like
[32:32.280 --> 32:35.440]  this because this was the kind of press they wanted and then ultimately we now
[32:35.440 --> 32:38.840]  live in an era where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations or
[32:38.840 --> 32:42.520]  billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to control and manipulate what news
[32:42.520 --> 32:46.600]  and views view a person's allowed to have or express or hear and the info wars
[32:46.600 --> 32:50.920]  audience has broken through that the they are the bridge from the founding to
[32:50.920 --> 32:53.960]  the modern age ultimate American democracy and freedom and that's why
[32:53.960 --> 32:57.720]  there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the platforming defamation
[32:57.720 --> 33:10.600]  lawfare and libel targeting you you're listening to the alex jones show you
[33:10.600 --> 33:34.240]  are the one they call president you are not the president no one who leads so
[33:34.240 --> 33:41.200]  many could possibly kneel so quickly I'm the man they're protecting I'm the
[33:41.200 --> 34:09.120]  president
[34:11.200 --> 34:31.480]  DrudgeReport.com, the biggest new site in the world, is definitely cutting through the
[34:31.480 --> 34:38.360]  electronic Berlin Wall like Godzilla smashing Tokyo.
[34:38.360 --> 34:46.840]  On screen, DrudgeReport.com, you can see it's linked to a Kellan McGreen article.
[34:46.840 --> 34:52.080]  I was not safe, she says, and it gets into the total hoax where she says that she was
[34:52.080 --> 34:54.000]  basically sexually assaulted.
[34:54.000 --> 34:57.320]  It's unbelievable and that people were drinking out of toilets.
[34:57.320 --> 35:03.960]  Now she's backing off and others are saying, oh, we heard they're drinking out of toilets.
[35:03.960 --> 35:05.360]  But guess what?
[35:05.360 --> 35:09.640]  Those who built all these migrant centers, the last two years of Obama's reign, when
[35:09.640 --> 35:14.160]  they really were having to put people in more like cages, because Obama had said, come here,
[35:14.160 --> 35:17.200]  the border's open, if you bring a child, you can get in.
[35:17.200 --> 35:18.800]  They started the flood.
[35:18.800 --> 35:25.160]  Oh, it turns out Southwest Key, that's the group that goes around with these Congress
[35:25.160 --> 35:33.160]  people saying everybody's in concentration camps, turns out he owns a large stake in
[35:33.160 --> 35:36.800]  the detention centers that Obama built.
[35:36.800 --> 35:41.160]  Obama said everybody come up here, they built UN refugee centers all over Central America
[35:41.160 --> 35:45.320]  and South America so people from around the world could get there and then be given their
[35:45.320 --> 35:49.760]  State Department money, $1,000 per leg, it's all in record.
[35:49.760 --> 35:54.200]  And then to get up here and guess who's making the money?
[35:54.200 --> 36:03.760]  Oh my goodness, Southwest Key CEO has financial stake in property leased by migrant shelter
[36:03.760 --> 36:11.000]  operators, all over the Southwest, isn't that just special?
[36:11.000 --> 36:17.280]  We're going to get more into that, but remember the free Obama phone, $3 billion was spent
[36:17.280 --> 36:22.640]  in the first administration of Obama, $5 billion the next.
[36:22.640 --> 36:28.640]  He has 8 billion smackers and guess who got the contract?
[36:28.640 --> 36:34.640]  A man named Carlos Slim who is reportedly the richest man in the world, that's not
[36:34.640 --> 36:39.960]  really true at $100 billion or whatever and Jeff Bezos sometimes is richer, the point
[36:39.960 --> 36:44.640]  is he's one of the richest people, there's old money that has more.
[36:44.640 --> 36:49.680]  But he got the contracts for $8 billion and reportedly made several billion dollars off
[36:49.680 --> 36:55.320]  the phones and then the database could keep track of all the poor people they gave it
[36:55.320 --> 36:59.160]  to to call them and get them to vote and get them to come out and do things.
[36:59.160 --> 37:02.720]  And if they lost phones, remember the old Obama phone lady, let's try to queue up Obama
[37:02.720 --> 37:03.720]  phone lady.
[37:03.720 --> 37:09.120]  Obama got us a phone, he's going to do more, remember the original clip, it's like six,
[37:09.120 --> 37:12.800]  seven years ago we can pull it up, we've had her in studio but I want the original Obama
[37:12.800 --> 37:18.440]  phone, she got us and goes, I've had three Obama phones and now I got five more, I like
[37:18.440 --> 37:26.280]  Obama, he gave us a phone, he's going to do more, sweet old lady, we gave her a lot more
[37:26.280 --> 37:31.200]  than that, we gave her like $5,000, real time she came here and you might get her wanting
[37:31.200 --> 37:39.480]  to have a better life, she was from Cleveland, we ought to check in on her but imagine the
[37:39.480 --> 37:50.760]  evil of AOC going with a group financed by people making tens of millions a year, it's
[37:50.760 --> 37:52.680]  what it says right here, off these things.
[37:52.680 --> 37:58.200]  One guy that heads up the group going down and saying open the borders but knowing the
[37:58.200 --> 38:02.720]  law is you're going to have to process people, you can't just say oh here are millions come
[38:02.720 --> 38:08.920]  on in with kids under your arm, a third of them aren't even their kids, this is insane.
[38:08.920 --> 38:15.560]  When you go to a Six Flags or Disney World, they see who you are, you pay, you get your
[38:15.560 --> 38:19.960]  bracelet, you go in, oh hey Disney World, you should just be open, they go bankrupt,
[38:19.960 --> 38:24.040]  oh how about the Vatican, they sure check you, they sure make you line up, they sure make
[38:24.040 --> 38:28.440]  you get a bracelet, oh but the Vatican says we should have open borders, how about your
[38:28.440 --> 38:32.800]  house, how about no door or screens on your windows, all the mosquitoes can come in, I
[38:32.800 --> 38:39.280]  mean clothing are barriers, everything we do is about steel cages on our cars, that's
[38:39.280 --> 38:45.720]  a barrier of protection, that's what borders are for and you have these people trying to
[38:45.720 --> 38:50.400]  implode them and bring in groups that then won't be able to get jobs or unskilled but
[38:50.400 --> 38:54.280]  don't worry they can stay in the detention center a few weeks and they can make a bunch
[38:54.280 --> 38:58.120]  of money off of them, thousands of dollars per head every few weeks and then the Democrats
[38:58.120 --> 39:03.320]  can get them and teach them how to vote, give them driver's license and put them in low-paid
[39:03.320 --> 39:08.240]  jobs under their control and then the Democrats then run systems where they milk part of the
[39:08.240 --> 39:12.600]  welfare money off of them that they get them signed up for in corrupt cities, this is a
[39:12.600 --> 39:20.240]  giant cash machine and AOC got caught lying about it all, I shot a special report last
[39:20.240 --> 39:28.680]  night Robert Barnes that I'm going to add to this, AOC jumps the shark ladies and gentlemen,
[39:28.680 --> 39:32.960]  says she was basically assaulted, now she's been backpedaling on all that, they're backpedaling
[39:32.960 --> 39:37.040]  on drinking out of toilets, we have photos in the article to show to TV viewers where
[39:37.040 --> 39:42.600]  it shows the stainless steel sink and water fountain, it's all built in side by side by
[39:42.600 --> 39:50.080]  the stainless steel toilet, these are the more modern nicer units, now click on that
[39:50.080 --> 39:56.520]  and then scroll down and it shows in the article on DrudgeReport.com, I was not safe and if
[39:56.520 --> 40:07.960]  you scroll down, it shows the supposed toilets that you drink out of, it's simply incredible
[40:07.960 --> 40:15.200]  that they think we are this stupid, there it is, so you got the toilet right there and
[40:15.200 --> 40:23.800]  some of the toilets above it is the sink and the water system, there you go ladies and
[40:23.800 --> 40:28.080]  gentlemen, so you have to stand at the side of it when you're at the sink, it's all in
[40:28.080 --> 40:33.080]  one unit so it doesn't get ripped off the wall so it doesn't break, it's high quality
[40:33.080 --> 40:37.680]  and we're spending billions, Trump finally got 4 plus billion more, he asked for 12 billion,
[40:37.680 --> 40:41.760]  he got 1 billion, he just got 4 billion, so now it's up to about 5.3 billion he's gotten
[40:41.760 --> 40:51.320]  this year to try to just pay for all this because it's up 635% in just the last year.
[40:51.320 --> 40:56.480]  We're being bumrushed by a UN organized invasion force with a bunch of Democrats making money
[40:56.480 --> 41:00.640]  on the detention centers that they got set up and got the contracts for before Trump
[41:00.640 --> 41:06.800]  ever got into office and then when people drowned coming across, Salvadorian president
[41:06.800 --> 41:10.920]  on death of drowned father and daughter, this guy went across multiple countries, went across
[41:10.920 --> 41:18.480]  a flooded Rio Grande river, drowned and it's America's fault that there was a river and
[41:18.480 --> 41:23.120]  he climbed into a rushing river during flash floods.
[41:23.120 --> 41:27.520]  That's right ladies and gentlemen, national review, it's our fault.
[41:27.520 --> 41:32.000]  Well, that's actually not true, I caught you there didn't I?
[41:32.000 --> 41:42.280]  He's not a leftist, he said it is the fault of El Salvador, but the left, they are saying
[41:42.280 --> 41:43.280]  it's our fault.
[41:43.280 --> 41:47.640]  But isn't it unusual to see somebody actually take responsibility when a little girl got
[41:47.640 --> 41:53.480]  brought across, it turned out 3 times by her mother, the word is smuggling, as a shield,
[41:53.480 --> 41:59.600]  the father said my ex-wife's a criminal, it's her fault my daughter went through 100 miles
[41:59.600 --> 42:06.840]  of desert with coyotes, 80% of the women get raped according to Amnesty International.
[42:06.840 --> 42:12.520]  That's the truth, it's her fault, it's that dad's fault, it's not America's fault, but
[42:12.520 --> 42:22.280]  Colin Kaepernick, he's God, he comes out and he says we are bad, America is bad, he doesn't
[42:22.280 --> 42:33.160]  like Nike putting out an American flag tennis shoe, and see once you accept political incorrectness,
[42:33.160 --> 42:37.080]  once you go with what the politically corrects say, it's the sky's the limit, it's total
[42:37.080 --> 42:44.120]  control, we come back, I'm going to show Americans at the border confronting these lying Democrat
[42:44.120 --> 42:48.800]  scumbags, a collection of communists and Islamists lying about women drinking out of
[42:48.800 --> 42:54.920]  toilets and lying about sexual assault and just spewing garbage, and we're going to
[42:54.920 --> 43:00.200]  play these clips straight ahead, this is powerful, stay with us.
[43:00.200 --> 43:04.000]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[43:04.000 --> 43:08.640]  So the Infowars model is a self-fulfilling, self-supporting structure that is promoting
[43:08.640 --> 43:13.520]  free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining
[43:13.520 --> 43:19.200]  one another, it is the only independent press of this size and scale, of this public reach,
[43:19.200 --> 43:24.000]  it is the one model that says here's a way to have a self-supporting, self-sustaining,
[43:24.000 --> 43:28.240]  self-structured, little de-democratic structure that because the audience determines what
[43:28.240 --> 43:32.600]  content goes up, the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices
[43:32.600 --> 43:36.360]  and supporting Infowars, and it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is,
[43:36.360 --> 43:40.760]  whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want that actually
[43:40.760 --> 43:45.160]  compete with the corporate driven model, and the ability to do that and at the same time
[43:45.160 --> 43:49.800]  support press, support speech, support letting the audience choose what news they want to
[43:49.800 --> 43:54.080]  see and what views they want to hold, and it's the ultimate American democratic expression
[43:54.080 --> 43:58.600]  and experiment, and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets.
[43:58.600 --> 44:03.240]  I'll be very, very clear with everybody about all of this, we're going into the season
[44:03.240 --> 44:07.720]  of war and they have been inches from shutting down the final mega counts we have, do their
[44:07.720 --> 44:12.240]  criminal activity and their digital fraud, and we need to know that we've got capital
[44:12.240 --> 44:16.480]  to go six months a year, we need it in here, we need to be provisioned, and you've got
[44:16.480 --> 44:20.560]  my total commitment that I am going to rampage forward against the enemy fearlessly.
[44:20.560 --> 44:25.000]  I'm loving every minute of this because I know I'm getting under their skin, I'm bloody
[44:25.000 --> 44:29.120]  and then I'm up politically, I'm banging heads with them and they can't help but attack
[44:29.120 --> 44:31.320]  back with lies and that just brings more people here.
[44:31.320 --> 44:35.760]  So I'm in one hell of a fight and so are you and I need war bonds, I need gas, I need
[44:35.760 --> 44:40.280]  ammo politically now, but literally if you flood us with money and if you flood us with
[44:40.280 --> 44:43.880]  product purchases and if you flood us with your word of mouth, you're unstoppable, we're
[44:43.880 --> 44:44.880]  unstoppable together.
[44:44.880 --> 44:48.040]  I want to send a strong message to the enemy, I want to raise a couple million dollars right
[44:48.040 --> 44:51.880]  now to let the enemy know that their attacks are failing and that you will stand with us
[44:51.880 --> 44:56.840]  and I will never back down, you have my commitment, this only gives me more energy and more understanding
[44:56.840 --> 45:01.240]  of what we're facing and that we were right about this.
[45:01.240 --> 45:06.000]  Info wars and free speech and your right to speech has been under unprecedented attack
[45:06.000 --> 45:12.800]  the last year or so, it's Orwellian, it's biblical, it's authoritarian, it's insane and I keep
[45:12.800 --> 45:18.480]  trying to judge and gauge when is the right time to have to stumble up on deck as the
[45:18.480 --> 45:24.080]  captain of this operation and say, hey, we're sinking, I've begged for your support before
[45:24.080 --> 45:27.680]  and thanks for keeping us afloat but this is the real SOS, if you don't buy a bunch
[45:27.680 --> 45:33.800]  of products and spread the word and keep fighting, info wars will be shut down, not just crippled
[45:33.800 --> 45:37.440]  and so we've reached that point, it'll make the enemy happy but you know, whatever, we
[45:37.440 --> 45:42.120]  have withstood so many of their attacks, we've gone through so much because of your support,
[45:42.120 --> 45:46.880]  you have been there but let me tell you, they are pissed, they haven't been successful and
[45:46.880 --> 45:51.120]  they're giving us their full assault so we need your prayers, your financial support
[45:51.120 --> 45:56.560]  and your word of mouth now at infoworksport.com, it's your fight, decide whether or not you
[45:56.560 --> 45:59.760]  don't want info wars to continue because we could be shut down.
[45:59.760 --> 46:05.400]  I just want listeners to understand, money is what allows us to beat this and stand against
[46:05.400 --> 46:09.960]  this and we're seeing a lot of orders right now with the save info wars 50% off but we
[46:09.960 --> 46:15.000]  make only like $5, $10 on higher marked up stuff, we're making like $2 on the toothpaste
[46:15.000 --> 46:19.200]  at that price and we're moving a ton of it, okay, but you move a couple hundred thousand
[46:19.200 --> 46:23.080]  dollars or something and you get $20,000, that doesn't pay for all the infrastructure,
[46:23.080 --> 46:26.440]  the bandwidth, the lawyers, the crew so we need to sell millions and millions and millions
[46:26.440 --> 46:27.440]  of dollars of product.
[46:27.440 --> 46:31.600]  I want to expand, not contract and for six months we've not decided to stand still, the
[46:31.600 --> 46:36.280]  enemy's been winning and I have labored and labored and labored and labored on this, I
[46:36.280 --> 46:39.240]  like to be expanding, I like to be winning, I like to be fighting and we are winning the
[46:39.240 --> 46:43.280]  info war, that's why we're so hated but we need to be retreaded, we need to be tuned
[46:43.280 --> 46:46.240]  up, we need to be fixed up, we never have time to get in the drive up, we got a lot
[46:46.240 --> 46:51.400]  of holes shot at us and the enemy wants to silence us, then they're really going to plant
[46:51.400 --> 46:54.960]  child porn on us, then they're going to kill me or you or anybody else, I mean the Democrats
[46:54.960 --> 46:58.920]  now are going into a full revolutionary fervor funded by foreign banks in the chai com show,
[46:58.920 --> 47:03.040]  go to infowarsstore.com.
[47:03.040 --> 47:32.040]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:33.040 --> 47:42.880]  The time has come, the time is here, the globalists are openly activating their anti-American
[47:42.880 --> 47:49.360]  forces to demonize the American people, the very existence of our borders and the American
[47:49.360 --> 47:50.920]  flag.
[47:50.920 --> 48:00.840]  From the NFL to Nike, to the night circuit, to AOC, to members of our armed forces, high
[48:00.840 --> 48:08.760]  level generals are all saying America is bad, that the American flag is offensive, the capitalism
[48:08.760 --> 48:15.920]  is offensive and that our president saying Americanism, not globalism, is racist and
[48:15.920 --> 48:21.680]  that the whole world could come here and get everything free but that we the citizens
[48:21.680 --> 48:26.800]  have to pay for it when our nation is on the verge of bankruptcy, if we don't have major
[48:26.800 --> 48:33.600]  innovation and major booms, we will collapse into third world status and the UN and others
[48:33.600 --> 48:40.600]  admit they're using giant migrant waves in Europe and the US to collapse the countries,
[48:40.600 --> 48:45.560]  to kill capitalism and bring in socialism so we can go the way of the old Soviet Union,
[48:45.560 --> 48:47.160]  North Korea and Venezuela.
[48:47.160 --> 48:52.720]  This is a plan and when you see top Democrats across the board, mayors, governors, you name
[48:52.720 --> 48:56.240]  it, saying America was never great, it'll never be great, they're going to take this
[48:56.240 --> 49:00.880]  country down, they're going to confiscate the wealth, why are they funded by billionaire
[49:00.880 --> 49:02.600]  hedge fund owners?
[49:02.600 --> 49:06.800]  Because the billionaire hedge fund owners are offshore and they want to overthrow this
[49:06.800 --> 49:11.800]  country just like Russia was overthrown in 1917.
[49:11.800 --> 49:19.120]  They're planning a Bolshevik revolution here run by the rich again to take over a country.
[49:19.120 --> 49:23.440]  This is the critical understanding and you've got the idiot masses believing they're going
[49:23.440 --> 49:31.440]  to get free healthcare, free housing, free education and a living wage even if you don't
[49:31.440 --> 49:39.320]  want to work in the words of AOC, those who can't work or don't want to work, close quote.
[49:39.320 --> 49:42.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time more than ever.
[49:42.480 --> 49:43.480]  We knew this time was coming.
[49:43.480 --> 49:48.440]  This is why they've tried to censor and block us last year ahead of the establishment making
[49:48.440 --> 49:51.520]  it's move to fully overthrow the West.
[49:51.520 --> 49:52.520]  This is it.
[49:52.520 --> 49:59.160]  They plan to go into violent revolution with Antifa throwing acid on people and beating
[49:59.160 --> 50:04.000]  people over the head at 4th of July events and attacking people in Portland last weekend,
[50:04.000 --> 50:08.840]  getting you ready for when they really make the violent move and come to people's houses.
[50:08.840 --> 50:11.120]  And they plan to do it by 2020.
[50:11.120 --> 50:13.080]  There's no doubt now, they admit it.
[50:13.080 --> 50:14.960]  They're on the stage saying it.
[50:14.960 --> 50:18.040]  They're trying to break this country now.
[50:18.040 --> 50:24.120]  Once ISIS overwhelmed, they're going to have 10 times the number of invaders coming in.
[50:24.120 --> 50:26.320]  This is a systematic program.
[50:26.320 --> 50:29.200]  So whatever you do, realize we were right.
[50:29.200 --> 50:31.360]  Our worst fears have been confirmed.
[50:31.360 --> 50:32.640]  It's all true.
[50:32.640 --> 50:36.840]  The new world order, the world government, the anti-Christian moves, the anti-unborn
[50:36.840 --> 50:37.840]  moves.
[50:37.840 --> 50:39.160]  Now they kill babies after they're born.
[50:39.160 --> 50:41.760]  Now they admit human clones.
[50:41.760 --> 50:44.320]  They're walking around in China.
[50:44.320 --> 50:46.080]  Everything is happening.
[50:46.080 --> 50:47.160]  That's why we've got to stay on air.
[50:47.160 --> 50:50.440]  That's why you've got to keep fighting because we're going to win this in the end.
[50:50.440 --> 50:52.880]  It's God's promise and we see the evidence.
[50:52.880 --> 50:55.680]  The tide's even turning as world government's built.
[50:55.680 --> 51:01.200]  A tide is coming against it and world government will only stand for a day.
[51:01.200 --> 51:05.680]  The Bible says in a day is generally a year in prophecy.
[51:05.680 --> 51:07.480]  This thing is going to be rough.
[51:07.480 --> 51:13.360]  It's going to be the last days of boot camp, but we're going to make it through it together.
[51:13.360 --> 51:17.560]  That said, ladies and gentlemen, without you financing info wars and buying great products
[51:17.560 --> 51:22.360]  you already need, we won't be here and we're running this July 4th save info war special
[51:22.360 --> 51:27.800]  right through at least till July 5th or so, but it's got to stop then because X2 is selling
[51:27.800 --> 51:28.800]  out.
[51:28.800 --> 51:30.320]  Turbo force is selling out.
[51:30.320 --> 51:33.920]  Super blue fluoride free toothpaste is selling out because people are buying a lot of it
[51:33.920 --> 51:35.680]  at 50% off.
[51:35.680 --> 51:38.200]  So we have to sell a lot of it to crack that nut.
[51:38.200 --> 51:39.240]  This is a big facility.
[51:39.240 --> 51:44.880]  A lot of crew fighting hard, paying for all our own bandwidth, but still winning thanks
[51:44.880 --> 51:49.520]  to you and your support, whether you're Matt Drudge linking to us or whether you're the
[51:49.520 --> 51:54.040]  general public buying fish oil you know you all need or getting great, you know, turmeric
[51:54.040 --> 51:56.840]  formula bodies, that's what makes it all possible.
[51:56.840 --> 52:01.640]  So I salute you and I thank you, but I ask you again, do your shopping with us.
[52:01.640 --> 52:06.960]  It's a simple win-win equation and we will continue on the face of this, but now it's
[52:06.960 --> 52:10.880]  more urgent than ever that we stay on the air because I wish the globals weren't as
[52:10.880 --> 52:11.880]  evil as I thought.
[52:11.880 --> 52:15.320]  I wish they wouldn't openly be pulling down American flags and courts rolling against
[52:15.320 --> 52:19.280]  them and Nike pulling it off shoes, but that shows you that when you've been taken over
[52:19.280 --> 52:22.960]  by a group, they tell you, don't fly your damn flag.
[52:22.960 --> 52:25.640]  That's what happens when you're invaded.
[52:25.640 --> 52:29.120]  That's what happens when you're conquered and they're seeing if they can make you do
[52:29.120 --> 52:31.800]  that, they can do anything.
[52:31.800 --> 52:34.880]  If they can sexualize your children and have you put up with it.
[52:34.880 --> 52:38.080]  They can do anything.
[52:38.080 --> 52:39.080]  Think about that.
[52:39.080 --> 52:45.760]  Infowarsstore.com, 50% off, store-wide free shipping, double-patriot points, whatever
[52:45.760 --> 52:50.040]  you do, commit now to history and know that buying products from us is one of the most
[52:50.040 --> 52:52.760]  important things you can do in the fight against the globalist.
[52:52.760 --> 52:59.600]  They see it as penultimate to take us out, taking Trump out as number one, taking me
[52:59.600 --> 53:03.240]  out as number two in their own admissions.
[53:03.240 --> 53:08.840]  Why is that because we've got their damn number and we've got you, an audience of activists
[53:08.840 --> 53:12.880]  that I salute no matter how old you are or how young you are, whether you're black or
[53:12.880 --> 53:15.840]  brown or white or pink.
[53:15.840 --> 53:22.000]  I was at the grocery store the other night and I had, it was late, it was about to close,
[53:22.000 --> 53:26.280]  it was 11 o'clock and my wife had forgotten some stuff, she asked me to go get it and
[53:26.280 --> 53:31.840]  I wanted some frozen pizzas anyways for a late night snack.
[53:31.840 --> 53:37.160]  I had four groups of Hispanic families run over to me and say, we love you, we love you,
[53:37.160 --> 53:42.920]  my brother's in town, he loves you, oh look, talk to me real quick, we're Mexicans but
[53:42.920 --> 53:43.920]  we love you.
[53:43.920 --> 53:45.800]  And I'm like, of course I love you too, you're an American, right?
[53:45.800 --> 53:49.200]  You love the country, you want freedom, you've been here probably longer than I have, yeah,
[53:49.200 --> 53:53.360]  oh yeah, yeah, you get what's going on exactly.
[53:53.360 --> 53:57.920]  It's not about people being Mexican, it's about the UN weaponizing, it's about blasting down
[53:57.920 --> 54:02.040]  the borders, it's about bringing people in from all over the world to be given voter IDs,
[54:02.040 --> 54:04.040]  to vote, to be under Democrat control.
[54:04.040 --> 54:12.160]  It's about a permanent underclass the globalists use, they admit it, to bring down nation states.
[54:12.160 --> 54:14.760]  So I'm going to start it next hour, I'm going to give the phone number out and take your
[54:14.760 --> 54:21.440]  calls on this but I'm going to get to it, of AOC getting caught with her pants down,
[54:21.440 --> 54:22.440]  man.
[54:22.440 --> 54:28.400]  They're in there, world's good in 12 years, cauliflower's racist, you know, oh she saw
[54:28.400 --> 54:31.640]  kids in cages and cried, none of it was true.
[54:31.640 --> 54:35.240]  They brought her into that border patrol office and they're going to release the footage.
[54:35.240 --> 54:41.400]  The witnesses all saw this and they kissed their butts and tried to get selfies with
[54:41.400 --> 54:46.880]  her and she screamed at them and said, you get away from me and she came out and said,
[54:46.880 --> 54:50.320]  it was horrible, they attacked me, I didn't feel safe, there were women drinking out of
[54:50.320 --> 54:57.840]  the toilets, they wanted to sexually do something to me, I felt like.
[54:57.840 --> 55:04.160]  And the locals got pissed because they lived there, they worked there and they surrounded
[55:04.160 --> 55:09.600]  AOC and the rest of the Democrats that actually got the contracts under Obama for the land
[55:09.600 --> 55:14.200]  and the emergency centers, oh they knew it was coming, they were setting up those U.N.
[55:14.200 --> 55:18.160]  bases down there to get everybody in there and before Obama left, boy, they started the
[55:18.160 --> 55:22.880]  flooding, first they said, oh there's no care of answers, no problem, while they own the
[55:22.880 --> 55:27.480]  facilities, making the money off of it, giving them the contact for the Democrats, putting
[55:27.480 --> 55:34.840]  them on buses to send them where they want and then they blame the border patrol and
[55:34.840 --> 55:40.080]  she says the border patrol, again, was making women drink out of toilets.
[55:40.080 --> 55:44.120]  If she gets away with that lie, what's the new one, yeah, let's show the video of more
[55:44.120 --> 55:49.200]  Africans from the Congo walking across the border of Texas and coming across river, there's
[55:49.200 --> 56:01.400]  new videos of it, trying to get into the concentration camps, yes, we're going to come back, we're
[56:01.400 --> 56:08.920]  going to play it all, but this is the reality folks, they're paying for people, plane tickets
[56:08.920 --> 56:14.240]  to fly out of anywhere in Africa to land in Central America and then they go to other
[56:14.240 --> 56:20.480]  refugee centers where they hand them a thousand dollar credit card or debit card and cash
[56:20.480 --> 56:25.400]  and they start the next leg, everybody goes whoa, there's a gold rush, they have the exact
[56:25.400 --> 56:31.760]  same thing starting seven years ago in Europe, this is an invasion, this is a plan and now
[56:31.760 --> 56:38.080]  thousands a day of Africans are getting apprehended, think about how widespread this is, some go
[56:38.080 --> 56:46.960]  across 11 countries to get here and most never get caught by the border patrol, a lot of them
[56:46.960 --> 56:53.160]  don't want to be caught, some do because they know they're released, yeah, that's the footage
[56:53.160 --> 56:56.600]  from a few weeks ago that came to San Antonio, there was another one of watch African and
[56:56.600 --> 57:02.360]  Haitians crossing in the US border and they're just mowing it on up, turning themselves in
[57:02.360 --> 57:07.160]  saying I'm a refugee, they get released in a few weeks on average and then 90% do not
[57:07.160 --> 57:13.880]  show up to the hearings and then AOC calls that a concentration camp, the article of
[57:13.880 --> 57:18.440]  all the video, all the proof, her tweets, her trying to back off the tweets, her staging
[57:18.440 --> 57:25.880]  photo ops, Kellerman Breen, dredgerport.com, right hand side, get it and share it with
[57:25.880 --> 57:34.120]  everyone, hoax 2.0, AOC claims border patrol agents sexually threatened her, that's right
[57:34.120 --> 57:41.160]  folks, Smollett part two and it just shows if she gets away with this, why not do more,
[57:41.160 --> 57:45.680]  hell maybe she'll say I sent her child porn next or I raped her, maybe she'll say Trump
[57:45.680 --> 57:50.040]  raped her, we'll be right back.
[57:50.040 --> 57:53.920]  I talk about this on the air and I know it stinks into people but I've decided that
[57:53.920 --> 57:57.680]  we're going to kind of reboot all our supplements in that if you go back five, six years ago
[57:57.680 --> 58:00.840]  before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits and the rest of it, I would
[58:00.840 --> 58:04.280]  talk about how great the products are and how they were the best and why they were and
[58:04.280 --> 58:07.640]  I'd have doctors on and experts to explain why they were so good and instead the last
[58:07.640 --> 58:11.200]  few years I'm like hey, we need to really support us or they'll shut us down, the biggest
[58:11.200 --> 58:13.920]  thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how wonderful
[58:13.920 --> 58:19.160]  they were and the left always has headlines everywhere, Jones sells unapproved supplements
[58:19.160 --> 58:25.280]  that he claims are supplements, no under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement
[58:25.280 --> 58:28.760]  has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it but then
[58:28.760 --> 58:33.040]  they say you've got to say it's not approved by them and all drugs are is the system trying
[58:33.040 --> 58:36.720]  to tweak what's in Mother Nature and manipulate it and do different things and a lot of drugs
[58:36.720 --> 58:40.640]  work great, they have side effects not with Mother Nature but Big Pharma doesn't want
[58:40.640 --> 58:47.040]  you knowing about God's medicine chest, infowarstore.com or triple eight, two five, three, three
[58:47.040 --> 58:50.600]  one, three nine.

[59:43.680 --> 59:53.960]  today.
[59:53.960 --> 1:00:08.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:08.960 --> 1:00:20.040]  Okay, here's what's going to happen, I'm going to get to all these critical news articles
[1:00:20.040 --> 1:00:23.520]  and clips next segment that I've been talking about, and then I'm going to open the phones
[1:00:23.520 --> 1:00:34.560]  up for the balance of the show on this Tuesday edition.
[1:00:34.560 --> 1:00:41.720]  When I started the show an hour ago, really almost unable to speak because we have so
[1:00:41.720 --> 1:00:49.360]  much information and there's so much proof of all of it that it's very, very frustrating
[1:00:49.360 --> 1:00:58.200]  to try to even collate all of that in your mind and try to present it to you.
[1:00:58.200 --> 1:01:06.240]  So here's what's going on, 100% from every angle, there's no doubting it.
[1:01:06.240 --> 1:01:09.840]  It's like getting a CAT scan, and you got tumors all over your body, and you know you're
[1:01:09.840 --> 1:01:14.720]  going to die, 100% inoperable.
[1:01:14.720 --> 1:01:19.200]  This could be operable, but it's we're going to look like Darth Vader after we come through
[1:01:19.200 --> 1:01:21.000]  it.
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:27.720]  And you know, we really don't have a choice because the alternative is so horrible.
[1:01:27.720 --> 1:01:32.840]  My God, the globalists have been licking their lips to gut this Christian country a thousand
[1:01:32.840 --> 1:01:38.520]  ways from Sunday, and they just have this wicked will to do it, and they've weakened
[1:01:38.520 --> 1:01:39.720]  us so much.
[1:01:39.720 --> 1:01:45.320]  And I see people fighting back, but when you look at them banning the American flag and
[1:01:45.320 --> 1:01:49.320]  pedophiles all over the news, praising sex with children, and people saying let's kill
[1:01:49.320 --> 1:01:53.640]  babies after they're born, you think, oh well, you know, people will wake up and we'll stop
[1:01:53.640 --> 1:01:54.640]  them.
[1:01:54.640 --> 1:02:00.400]  What really happens is people just get conditioned to accept it.
[1:02:00.400 --> 1:02:05.360]  And there really does come a point where civil disobedience is going to be needed.
[1:02:05.360 --> 1:02:11.080]  And I'll just say it, euthanasia killing babies after they're born because a bioethics board
[1:02:11.080 --> 1:02:13.760]  says so it's murder.
[1:02:13.760 --> 1:02:18.120]  And so at a certain point when people are killing already born children, I'm not going
[1:02:18.120 --> 1:02:23.720]  to organize anything violent, but I'm just telling you that we become accomplices at
[1:02:23.720 --> 1:02:25.440]  that point.
[1:02:25.440 --> 1:02:31.080]  And so if we don't say no, and if we don't start talking about the fact that these children
[1:02:31.080 --> 1:02:33.720]  need to be defended, we become accomplices.
[1:02:33.720 --> 1:02:37.200]  And I've just never sold out in my life, and I've always in my conscience start telling
[1:02:37.200 --> 1:02:39.880]  me something, I have to start getting ready to take action.
[1:02:39.880 --> 1:02:47.120]  And that doesn't mean I'm going to go out and kill any of these people that are convicted
[1:02:47.120 --> 1:02:49.960]  murderers and people that say they want your children.
[1:02:49.960 --> 1:02:54.880]  It means, though, that I'm going to get more aggressive in what I do news-wise, and it
[1:02:54.880 --> 1:03:00.560]  means that, let's just say this, my brain, I can't help it, is starting to unlock different
[1:03:00.560 --> 1:03:04.760]  areas of my genetic weapons systems.
[1:03:04.760 --> 1:03:08.080]  You've seen all that here on air what we've done in 20 years, 25 years.
[1:03:08.080 --> 1:03:11.920]  I mean, we're really going down the road towards violent civil war.
[1:03:11.920 --> 1:03:16.720]  And let's not lie to ourselves.
[1:03:16.720 --> 1:03:21.200]  You've seen Antifa cooking up chemical weapons, acid to throw on people's faces, government
[1:03:21.200 --> 1:03:24.480]  sanction in Portland, and hitting people in the head with crowbars, splitting them down
[1:03:24.480 --> 1:03:27.920]  to the skull, and the media defending it to Huffington Post today.
[1:03:27.920 --> 1:03:30.800]  They're attacking us.
[1:03:30.800 --> 1:03:37.360]  Antifa are mainly government workers, federal and state, and then health department type
[1:03:37.360 --> 1:03:39.880]  folks, professor people.
[1:03:39.880 --> 1:03:40.880]  They want control.
[1:03:40.880 --> 1:03:43.440]  And they want their system to take over.
[1:03:43.440 --> 1:03:48.600]  Their blue, rat-infested feces piled garbage dumps.
[1:03:48.600 --> 1:03:55.040]  And so, this is their moment when the cancer metastasizes.
[1:03:55.040 --> 1:03:59.480]  And so, you've got to be as wise as a serpent, as a dove, walk softly, carry a big stick.
[1:03:59.480 --> 1:04:07.080]  Let's tell you, Roosevelt said, we just have to understand that they're preparing to actually
[1:04:07.080 --> 1:04:09.320]  come after everybody.
[1:04:09.320 --> 1:04:13.920]  And they think, if they kill some people at their houses or whatever, or shoot up a ball
[1:04:13.920 --> 1:04:18.560]  game of Republicans that they'd have gotten, you know, 10 or 15 of them, they think the
[1:04:18.560 --> 1:04:21.400]  rest of Congress would have backed down, plus that would have gotten rid of the majority
[1:04:21.400 --> 1:04:23.560]  of the Republicans had.
[1:04:23.560 --> 1:04:30.600]  So, my point is, they're willing to do anything, from setting a nuke off on Congress to you
[1:04:30.600 --> 1:04:31.600]  name it.
[1:04:31.600 --> 1:04:33.440]  And they've got collaborators inside the military.
[1:04:33.440 --> 1:04:36.120]  They got collaborators all over the CIA.
[1:04:36.120 --> 1:04:40.040]  They've got our people, too, everywhere, but I got to tell you, folks, this isn't a game
[1:04:40.040 --> 1:04:42.040]  or a joke.
[1:04:42.040 --> 1:04:45.120]  And you're not going to make a deal with these people and have them back down.
[1:04:45.120 --> 1:04:48.880]  You sign on with them, you sign on with Satan, so people better decide which side they're
[1:04:48.880 --> 1:04:49.880]  on.
[1:04:49.880 --> 1:04:53.920]  But they're doxing federal law enforcement everywhere, and it's not going to be Antique
[1:04:53.920 --> 1:04:59.160]  or the Hitsom, it's going to be Hezbollah and MS-13.
[1:04:59.160 --> 1:05:06.280]  Living with InfoWars is a great honor, but I still need my morning coffee, and luckily,
[1:05:06.280 --> 1:05:12.080]  our break room at the InfoWars headquarters is stocked full of high quality InfoWars store
[1:05:12.080 --> 1:05:14.640]  Patriot Blend coffee.

[1:05:21.360 --> 1:05:25.960]  coffee at the ideal altitude for the perfect cup.
[1:05:25.960 --> 1:05:31.240]  A robust coffee with great flavor and mild acidity.
[1:05:31.240 --> 1:05:36.920]  There has never been a more important time to support InfoWars, so if you love coffee
[1:05:36.920 --> 1:05:42.240]  and if you want to fight for freedom, then you can help.
[1:05:42.240 --> 1:05:49.480]  Order now at the InfoWars store, sign up for auto-ship, and get your own high quality supply
[1:05:49.480 --> 1:05:56.480]  of Patriot Blend coffee delivered right to your door at InfoWarsStore.com.
[1:06:19.480 --> 1:06:30.480]  There is no longer any doubt, multinational companies and governments are funding an attempted
[1:06:30.480 --> 1:06:38.040]  violent, Maoist style overthrow of the US, federal courts are ruling the American flag
[1:06:38.040 --> 1:06:44.320]  as a hate symbol, Nahi is pulling tennis shoes with the American flag on them, our borders
[1:06:44.320 --> 1:06:48.200]  are being totally collapsed, already born babies are being killed, world government
[1:06:48.200 --> 1:06:53.560]  is here, we are going to lay it all out in just a moment, this is such a critical broadcast,
[1:06:53.560 --> 1:06:59.400]  only two days away from our nation's birthday, Antifa is pledging massive acid attacks and
[1:06:59.400 --> 1:07:07.640]  other huge events will be covering it all here live and on the ground.
[1:07:07.640 --> 1:07:12.400]  Now is the time for decision, now is the time for everyone watching and listening to decide
[1:07:12.400 --> 1:07:15.880]  which side they are on, and if you decide that you want to stop the forces that are
[1:07:15.880 --> 1:07:21.040]  banning the American flag and that are attacking the family and that are attacking our borders
[1:07:21.040 --> 1:07:26.720]  and our country, then our military and our heritage, if you want to defend that then now
[1:07:26.720 --> 1:07:30.480]  is the time to take action and that means word of mouth about this broadcast and that
[1:07:30.480 --> 1:07:35.840]  means buying products at InfoWarsStore.com and that means praying for InfoWars and praying
[1:07:35.840 --> 1:07:41.520]  for President Trump and praying for yourself and praying for peace and praying for justice.
[1:07:41.520 --> 1:07:44.840]  We're running it through July 4th but it's got to end because we're running out a lot
[1:07:44.840 --> 1:07:49.440]  of the best-selling items like X2 and Rainforest and Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.

[1:08:06.240 --> 1:08:11.640]  or InfoWarsLife.com.
[1:08:11.640 --> 1:08:15.160]  I'm going to give the number out at the start of the next segment, I'm going to take calls
[1:08:15.160 --> 1:08:20.120]  for at least an hour and a half after that on several big topics and let's get right
[1:08:20.120 --> 1:08:24.960]  into the central one right now.
[1:08:24.960 --> 1:08:31.080]  You could cut the historical significance and the electricity of the crossroads with
[1:08:31.080 --> 1:08:33.120]  a knife.
[1:08:33.120 --> 1:08:45.080]  You could cut the tension in the air with a knife.
[1:08:45.080 --> 1:08:51.280]  Everything you're seeing has been pre-planned and pre-positioned.
[1:08:51.280 --> 1:08:57.560]  If you read what anti-globalist, anti-world government patriots wrote in the 50s and 60s
[1:08:57.560 --> 1:09:03.360]  and 70s and 80s, it's come true word-for-word like total prophecy.
[1:09:03.360 --> 1:09:10.080]  Well, yeah, we had senior senators like Barry Goldwater at the hearings in closed committee
[1:09:10.080 --> 1:09:15.560]  where the Carnegie Foundation called for world government at the end of the family.
[1:09:15.560 --> 1:09:21.920]  People like Congressman Larry McDonald, a Democrat, who was a doctor and who was led
[1:09:21.920 --> 1:09:27.120]  into the highest level of what was happening by people in the CIA that didn't like what
[1:09:27.120 --> 1:09:31.720]  was happening and they killed him over it.
[1:09:31.720 --> 1:09:33.080]  All these people were demonized.
[1:09:33.080 --> 1:09:35.600]  Lyndon LaRouche was led in on all this.
[1:09:35.600 --> 1:09:41.080]  He used to have weekly meetings with the CIA and with Ronald Reagan that later got declassified.
[1:09:41.080 --> 1:09:46.160]  That's why they put him in prison claiming he didn't pay a credit card for a month and
[1:09:46.160 --> 1:09:48.160]  called it wire fraud.
[1:09:48.160 --> 1:09:49.160]  They could do that to me.
[1:09:49.160 --> 1:09:53.240]  They could do that to you.
[1:09:53.240 --> 1:09:57.440]  And they're trying to incite race war and they're trying to incite war between the
[1:09:57.440 --> 1:09:59.640]  sexes with all the fake rape allegations.
[1:09:59.640 --> 1:10:03.680]  They've had the 25th woman come out with no evidence, no proof, no nothing and say Trump
[1:10:03.680 --> 1:10:05.880]  raped him.
[1:10:05.880 --> 1:10:12.160]  That turns out the woman is an insane moron and a whole bunch of women admit they lied
[1:10:12.160 --> 1:10:15.760]  about cabin on Trump.
[1:10:15.760 --> 1:10:23.520]  I confirmed with law firms that former employees that have worked here were paid $10,000 and
[1:10:23.520 --> 1:10:31.640]  were told that one of the conversations got recorded and for $10,000 they'd say anything
[1:10:31.640 --> 1:10:35.160]  they wanted and they said, tell us Alex Jones is a homosexual.
[1:10:35.160 --> 1:10:39.960]  We think that will hurt him with his crowd and they couldn't even get the individual
[1:10:39.960 --> 1:10:40.960]  to fully lie.
[1:10:40.960 --> 1:10:49.080]  He never hit on me, but I felt like he was hitting on me.
[1:10:49.080 --> 1:10:50.840]  Think about that, folks.
[1:10:50.840 --> 1:10:59.320]  When they're so bold that Hillary Clinton's law firm will pay you $10,000, couple pieces
[1:10:59.320 --> 1:11:03.120]  of silver.
[1:11:03.120 --> 1:11:06.720]  Imagine what that's like to be Alex Jones or Brett Kavanaugh or Trump.
[1:11:06.720 --> 1:11:07.720]  I'm in that exclusive club.
[1:11:07.720 --> 1:11:14.800]  By the way, I'm not a victim, I'm not complaining, but I'm telling you, I'm over the target.
[1:11:14.800 --> 1:11:17.800]  That's why we're getting hit so hard and I'm willing to take whatever they do to shout,
[1:11:17.800 --> 1:11:18.800]  but they're letting me know.
[1:11:18.800 --> 1:11:22.360]  They're like, hey, bro, we just put out false headlines, you're sending child porn out
[1:11:22.360 --> 1:11:23.360]  there.
[1:11:23.360 --> 1:11:27.240]  Notice it all got retracted, but that was the next week.
[1:11:27.240 --> 1:11:28.920]  You know what comes after that, don't you, Jones?
[1:11:28.920 --> 1:11:33.240]  Yeah, I know a bullet in the head.
[1:11:33.240 --> 1:11:35.960]  I'm not going to let you keep having your way with the children.
[1:11:35.960 --> 1:11:41.160]  It's the Democrats everywhere praising pedophilia and killing babies after they're born.
[1:11:41.160 --> 1:11:45.000]  We all know who likes to hurt children, who likes to steal their innocence and steal their
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:46.000]  lives.
[1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:47.000]  It's you.
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:48.000]  You judge a tree by its fruits.
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:49.000]  Guess what?
[1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:55.720]  Everything you did blew up in your face.
[1:11:55.720 --> 1:12:05.440]  The worst time of year for M4 Wars is always the end of a school year and end of July 4.
[1:12:05.440 --> 1:12:15.160]  When people are on vacation and we've had the best June and July in the 25 year history
[1:12:15.160 --> 1:12:27.360]  of M4 Wars, we were in the red this year until you pulled that crap two weeks ago.
[1:12:27.360 --> 1:12:30.960]  So you go ahead and put a big old fat, juicy bullet in my head.
[1:12:30.960 --> 1:12:33.200]  I'll never commit suicide, by the way.
[1:12:33.200 --> 1:12:37.320]  I don't fear death, and you watch what America does to that.
[1:12:37.320 --> 1:12:43.800]  You go ahead and try to kill Trump because the American people know what you're up to,
[1:12:43.800 --> 1:12:49.600]  jackasses, and you're not dealing with it in a sleep country anymore.
[1:12:49.600 --> 1:12:54.800]  You're dealing with a sleeping giant that's awake.
[1:12:54.800 --> 1:13:01.360]  So I'm proud, ladies and gentlemen, of how far we've come together.
[1:13:01.360 --> 1:13:07.400]  This is a man's game, this is a woman's game if women want to get engaged, a lot of them
[1:13:07.400 --> 1:13:08.400]  are.
[1:13:08.400 --> 1:13:12.400]  This is a very dangerous adult world we're in, and we need adults.
[1:13:12.400 --> 1:13:15.440]  You don't think I don't want to be at the shooting range?
[1:13:15.440 --> 1:13:16.960]  You don't think I don't want to be at the driving range?
[1:13:16.960 --> 1:13:21.800]  You don't think I don't want to be up in the Rocky Mountains riding a horse up a hill,
[1:13:21.800 --> 1:13:26.240]  go hunting a wildcat, or bow hunting a bear?
[1:13:26.240 --> 1:13:30.760]  You don't think I don't want to be swimming in the Caribbean, or maybe the Mediterranean?
[1:13:30.760 --> 1:13:36.240]  You don't think I don't want to be diving down a 150-foot ship?
[1:13:36.240 --> 1:13:41.400]  I love to scuba dive, I love to hike, hell, I used to even be able to mountain climb a
[1:13:41.400 --> 1:13:47.120]  little bit, but I've committed everything I've got to this because there's no future
[1:13:47.120 --> 1:13:49.120]  if we don't do it.
[1:13:49.120 --> 1:13:52.040]  That's why I'm commending all of you and thanking all of you and the radio stations,
[1:13:52.040 --> 1:13:56.160]  the affiliates, everybody, but this is an epic war.
[1:13:56.160 --> 1:14:02.120]  And then we come full circle back to the fact that we're dealing with a real world government
[1:14:02.120 --> 1:14:09.520]  whose end game is the end of humanity, a post-human future, where you're not even able to have
[1:14:09.520 --> 1:14:14.760]  children genetically because we're so poisoned, and that all there are are artificial humanoids,
[1:14:14.760 --> 1:14:18.360]  cyborgs, and those that emerge with silicon.
[1:14:18.360 --> 1:14:22.680]  This is the admitted game plan, this is the admitted destination we're being told, like
[1:14:22.680 --> 1:14:27.040]  you go to a theater and you buy a ticket, they give you a program of the three acts,
[1:14:27.040 --> 1:14:30.800]  and you're reading what happens and what's coming up next, or an opera, and you're reading
[1:14:30.800 --> 1:14:40.440]  it and you're seeing that we're not included.
[1:14:40.440 --> 1:14:45.760]  You read it and you see what they say they're going to do.
[1:14:45.760 --> 1:14:48.400]  Thousands of articles, oh, they're looking to make animal-human hybrids, and then they're
[1:14:48.400 --> 1:14:52.680]  later in, oh, we actually did it years ago, or, oh, yeah, the first babies born with their
[1:14:52.680 --> 1:14:56.520]  genes edited who really aren't humans, the first babies with four or five parents, been
[1:14:56.520 --> 1:15:03.960]  born in China, men's fertility plunging straight down, cancer exploding straight up, IQ is
[1:15:03.960 --> 1:15:04.960]  plunging.
[1:15:04.960 --> 1:15:12.400]  We're being killed, mesmerized by the television, mesmerized by the chemicals, and I'm saying,
[1:15:12.400 --> 1:15:16.240]  wake up, struggle out of it, fight back, realize what's going on, and you'll get stronger
[1:15:16.240 --> 1:15:25.040]  under attack instead of weaker.
[1:15:25.040 --> 1:15:30.720]  All my genetic memories being a farmer riding a horse or living alive or fighting, you don't
[1:15:30.720 --> 1:15:34.160]  think I want to be up here just going up to these globals for no reason, but we have to
[1:15:34.160 --> 1:15:38.480]  do it, ladies and gentlemen, because they want to kill human future forever because
[1:15:38.480 --> 1:15:43.880]  they've sold out to the Cosmic Con artist, Satan, Lucifer, the old serpent, the devil.
[1:15:43.880 --> 1:15:49.160]  All right, I'm getting to the AOC being confronted beautifully by Hispanic Texans for her lying
[1:15:49.160 --> 1:15:50.160]  straight ahead.
[1:15:50.160 --> 1:15:51.160]  I'll give the number out.
[1:15:51.160 --> 1:15:52.160]  We'll take your calls.
[1:15:52.160 --> 1:15:56.160]  I'm Alex Jones, NewsWars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[1:15:56.160 --> 1:16:01.320]  Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain, the hottest financial sector
[1:16:01.320 --> 1:16:03.160]  without all the speculation.

[1:16:08.360 --> 1:16:12.680]  Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an equipment
[1:16:12.680 --> 1:16:16.000]  leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace.
[1:16:16.000 --> 1:16:19.880]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is
[1:16:19.880 --> 1:16:24.000]  in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[1:16:24.000 --> 1:16:28.520]  Not a security IPO or note, blockchain data centers have approved turnkey equipment sale
[1:16:28.520 --> 1:16:34.720]  leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account each

[1:16:53.320 --> 1:16:56.840]  before purchasing not an offer to buy or sell a security which requires an offering document.

[1:17:26.200 --> 1:17:28.040]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[1:17:28.040 --> 1:17:31.960]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[1:17:31.960 --> 1:17:33.480]  I sued the IRS in one.
[1:17:33.480 --> 1:17:36.440]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[1:17:36.440 --> 1:17:39.720]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[1:17:39.720 --> 1:17:41.960]  tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[1:17:41.960 --> 1:17:43.320]  I can help you too.
[1:17:43.320 --> 1:17:46.320]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[1:17:46.320 --> 1:17:48.560]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[1:17:48.560 --> 1:17:58.760]  Call 800-34-no-tax or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[1:17:58.760 --> 1:18:00.640]  Robert Barnes, what has Big Tech become?
[1:18:00.640 --> 1:18:03.960]  Big Tech are big babies that have become big bullies and the way they did so is because
[1:18:03.960 --> 1:18:08.400]  they face no consequence of social, economic, political or legal for their illicit activities
[1:18:08.400 --> 1:18:09.400]  over two decades.
[1:18:09.400 --> 1:18:12.800]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the
[1:18:12.800 --> 1:18:16.080]  independent free press that care about this, the ordinary members of the public and the
[1:18:16.080 --> 1:18:20.360]  audience that care about this have to bring real social, political, economic consequence
[1:18:20.360 --> 1:18:23.440]  to their course of conduct, otherwise they will never change and they will become the
[1:18:23.440 --> 1:18:27.480]  Big Tech oligarchs, the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century who ran American
[1:18:27.480 --> 1:18:31.480]  politics and ran American economy almost into the ground until we were able to recover
[1:18:31.480 --> 1:18:32.600]  after the Great Depression.
[1:18:32.600 --> 1:18:37.760]  The informer's audience is the fuel that flames the light of liberty across the world to make
[1:18:37.760 --> 1:18:42.520]  real the actions of independent free speech, to make real the original promise of an independent
[1:18:42.520 --> 1:18:43.520]  free press.
[1:18:43.520 --> 1:18:47.920]  The resolution is Big Tech and Big Media manipulating and working with each other to try to meddle
[1:18:47.920 --> 1:18:50.040]  with elections, to try to shake people's thoughts.
[1:18:50.040 --> 1:18:52.880]  And then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening.
[1:18:52.880 --> 1:18:54.720]  It's the ultimate form of gaslighting.
[1:18:54.720 --> 1:18:56.640]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw.
[1:18:56.640 --> 1:18:58.960]  Even it is what you just saw.
[1:18:58.960 --> 1:19:02.880]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena and the public square.
[1:19:02.880 --> 1:19:07.400]  The other thing that's unique about Info Wars is it is the only network of this reach that
[1:19:07.400 --> 1:19:10.640]  is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy.
[1:19:10.640 --> 1:19:14.720]  It's not backed by some billionaire that's not being funded by a secret foreign government.
[1:19:14.720 --> 1:19:16.440]  It is completely independent of all that.
[1:19:16.440 --> 1:19:22.120]  It is an old school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press
[1:19:22.120 --> 1:19:26.000]  and freedom of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of
[1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:30.360]  the country they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this
[1:19:30.360 --> 1:19:32.320]  because this was the kind of press they wanted.
[1:19:32.320 --> 1:19:35.720]  And then ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been co-opted by big
[1:19:35.720 --> 1:19:39.720]  corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to control and manipulate
[1:19:39.720 --> 1:19:44.280]  what news and views view a person is allowed to have or express or hear and the Info Wars
[1:19:44.280 --> 1:19:49.120]  audience has broken through that they are the bridge from the founding to the modern
[1:19:49.120 --> 1:19:53.000]  age ultimate American democracy and freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented
[1:19:53.000 --> 1:20:20.000]  onslaught of the platforming defamation, lawfare and libel targeting you.
[1:20:23.000 --> 1:20:30.680]  Now ladies and gentlemen welcome back on your host Alex Jones.
[1:20:30.680 --> 1:20:37.760]  The video we're about to play is only a few minute compilation of 30 plus minutes of this
[1:20:37.760 --> 1:20:43.340]  open borders group that's actually financed by a company that owns much of the land and
[1:20:43.340 --> 1:20:48.800]  services the detention facilities that Obama built after he said come to America the borders
[1:20:48.800 --> 1:20:52.080]  open to triple the amount.
[1:20:52.080 --> 1:20:58.560]  Now it's up 630 plus percent and Trump is being blamed when the globalist triggered
[1:20:58.560 --> 1:21:00.800]  the whole thing.
[1:21:00.800 --> 1:21:07.160]  Unbelievable scandal but AOC dumps it down to I saw women drinking out of toilets I felt
[1:21:07.160 --> 1:21:13.040]  sexually threatened close quote it's unbelievable and of course the board patrol is now releasing
[1:21:13.040 --> 1:21:18.040]  photos that there are no drinking out of toilets there are sinks there are water fountains in
[1:21:18.040 --> 1:21:24.640]  the facilities there's whole bathroom areas these are open air areas people that are found
[1:21:24.640 --> 1:21:31.680]  to be convicted murderers or criminals are put into tension absolutely I mean you got
[1:21:31.680 --> 1:21:35.120]  people coming into your country you check them that's what borders are this is a fundamental
[1:21:35.120 --> 1:21:40.840]  assault on reality but hey we believe there's only a thousand genders now so we don't believe
[1:21:40.840 --> 1:21:46.280]  in mother and father why not say we don't believe in borders these rich people all live
[1:21:46.280 --> 1:21:50.480]  behind fences and borders try to go to one of their events and say I want to go through
[1:21:50.480 --> 1:21:57.040]  here no borders no wall no USA at all it's the death of logic so here's AOC saying she
[1:21:57.040 --> 1:22:08.360]  wasn't safe she didn't feel safe around the officers at the border facility in that last
[1:22:08.360 --> 1:22:16.800]  facility I was not safe you have any comment about what was posted about you and the alleged
[1:22:16.800 --> 1:22:25.680]  Facebook group I mean I think it's just it's just indicative of the violent culture that
[1:22:25.680 --> 1:22:31.480]  we saw on the inside now that's her being came on CNN in her tweets that are linked
[1:22:31.480 --> 1:22:38.040]  up on Rogerport.com on the right hand side where she says she felt threatened she says
[1:22:38.040 --> 1:22:41.280]  that women were drinking out of toilets that people were yelling and screaming at her and
[1:22:41.280 --> 1:22:46.960]  threatening her and she felt sexually threatened and the lies go on and on from there think
[1:22:46.960 --> 1:22:54.480]  about the boldness of this but she's gotten away with so much now let's play that clip
[1:22:54.480 --> 1:22:59.600]  clip nine AOC says migrants were forced to drink out of the toilet and then we're going
[1:22:59.600 --> 1:23:05.240]  to go to mainly Hispanic citizens down the border by the way half the country below the
[1:23:05.240 --> 1:23:10.640]  age of 15 is Hispanic something like 35% of the country is Hispanic it's your guns it's
[1:23:10.640 --> 1:23:14.600]  your country it's your property you built the country all built together everybody's
[1:23:14.600 --> 1:23:19.680]  intermarrying it's ridiculous the idea that the American flag is bad and all Hispanics
[1:23:19.680 --> 1:23:24.160]  don't like her Hispanics don't want a border remember the Democrats on the stage the spanish
[1:23:24.160 --> 1:23:28.240]  Americans are upset about a border you know if you're a spanish you don't want a border
[1:23:28.240 --> 1:23:32.240]  when it's everybody to come in including murderers and criminals the idea of selling this and
[1:23:32.240 --> 1:23:36.040]  it's not working it's like Trump's getting double the support any Republican ever got
[1:23:36.040 --> 1:23:42.320]  from Hispanics that's why Democrats are doubling down that oh Trump hates you he wants to get
[1:23:42.320 --> 1:23:47.440]  you oh and he hates Jews too that's why his daughter's married to an Orthodox Jew and
[1:23:47.440 --> 1:23:52.920]  he's pro-Israel none of it's true it's the opposite of what they say it's ideology that
[1:23:52.920 --> 1:23:58.040]  matters and they're taking the poorest and the most criminal from all the world and
[1:23:58.040 --> 1:24:01.400]  they're putting them in refugee centers for up to six months brainwashing them before
[1:24:01.400 --> 1:24:07.640]  they ship them up here this is a weaponized takeover so here's AOC says migrants were
[1:24:07.640 --> 1:24:11.760]  forced to drink out of the toilet totally not I mean maybe they were so stupid never
[1:24:11.760 --> 1:24:15.560]  seen a toilet a lot of illegal aliens you know don't use the toilet because you're not
[1:24:15.560 --> 1:24:19.160]  supposed to flush well they don't have I guess running water in many areas so they wiped
[1:24:19.160 --> 1:24:23.920]  their ass and you go into these stalls at nice truck stops you name it and there's piles
[1:24:23.920 --> 1:24:29.920]  of people's wipes they have signs on the door in Spanish saying please in other languages
[1:24:29.920 --> 1:24:38.880]  please put the ass wipes in the toilet I'm not joking oh but AOC she grew up rich and
[1:24:38.880 --> 1:24:42.400]  powerful she's it's all made up her whole backstory you know she's just up there spewing
[1:24:42.400 --> 1:24:45.560]  all this garbage so let's go ahead and go to AOC saying they're drinking out of toilets
[1:24:45.560 --> 1:24:52.160]  there's abuse in these facilities there's abuse this was done on their best behavior
[1:24:52.160 --> 1:25:01.040]  and they put them in a room with no running water and these women were being told by CBP
[1:25:01.040 --> 1:25:06.640]  officers to drink out of the toilet they were drinking water out of the toilet and that was
[1:25:06.640 --> 1:25:11.080]  them knowing what a congressional visit was coming that was this is CBP on their best
[1:25:11.080 --> 1:25:19.040]  behavior to drink out of the toilet the lies the entitlement and the Democrats advertised
[1:25:19.040 --> 1:25:23.440]  that come here under Obama he gives his friends the contracts to build them and to finance
[1:25:23.440 --> 1:25:27.040]  them and to have the land and then those groups call for more open borders to cause a bigger
[1:25:27.040 --> 1:25:33.240]  crisis to make money off of it that's mainstream news Southwest Key CEO has financial stake
[1:25:33.240 --> 1:25:40.920]  in properties leased by migrant shelter operators unbelievable now let's go to the clip in South
[1:25:40.920 --> 1:25:48.280]  Texas where citizens get in their face mainly Hispanic Texans shout down pro-migrant Democrats
[1:25:48.280 --> 1:25:52.920]  and we've got the footage of the press conference we have all these footage on the site of the
[1:25:52.920 --> 1:26:18.920]  shots back here it is
[1:26:18.920 --> 1:26:35.200]  we did not get answers completely unacceptable we did not get answers about the MPP program
[1:26:35.200 --> 1:26:43.480]  the remaining Mexico program people are behind so grateful to my colleagues who've made
[1:26:43.480 --> 1:26:50.280]  the journey all the way to El Paso in order to see for themselves and in the House of
[1:26:50.280 --> 1:26:57.600]  Representatives today we remain very concerned about the conditions in which people are being
[1:26:57.600 --> 1:27:06.120]  kept some had been separated from their kids that she was told by an agent to drink water
[1:27:06.120 --> 1:27:15.360]  out of the toilet these are the conditions the border patrol was just trying to show
[1:27:15.360 --> 1:27:21.760]  what they wanted to show lots of supplies and also I think that they reduced the number
[1:27:21.760 --> 1:27:26.760]  of people we need to be spending money on helping individuals with health care needs
[1:27:26.760 --> 1:27:32.400]  with housing with food not with all these enforcement efforts that we're seeing here
[1:27:32.400 --> 1:27:37.320]  today that are separating families when we get back to DC something passed for these
[1:27:37.320 --> 1:28:04.520]  families and for our country

[1:35:34.840 --> 1:35:41.640]  months ago rush limbaugh predicts purge of us flag the next flag that will come under
[1:35:41.640 --> 1:35:47.520]  assault won't be long is the american flag he said in 2015 we written a new article about
[1:35:47.520 --> 1:35:52.800]  this by removing betsy ross shoes from the store shelves and i was fulfilled a prophecy
[1:35:52.800 --> 1:35:57.600]  by radio host rush limbaugh who predicted the us flag would face expulsion well the
[1:35:57.600 --> 1:36:01.880]  ninth circuit already ruled that so yeah it's not a prediction it's a fact limbaugh made
[1:36:01.880 --> 1:36:08.440]  the prediction during his nationwide purge of the confederate flag in 2015 the american
[1:36:08.440 --> 1:36:12.680]  flag has flown over slave nation much more than the confederate flag folks the american
[1:36:12.680 --> 1:36:19.120]  flag has flown over all kinds of atrocities he said adding that he believed the real objective
[1:36:19.120 --> 1:36:26.120]  was the eventual removal of the us flag full story and the video and audio of him saying
[1:36:26.120 --> 1:36:35.160]  it four years ago is up on info wars dot com and we've got a o c out there at the press
[1:36:35.160 --> 1:36:40.240]  conference with we should do a piece on this because i saw the articles when we posted

[1:38:32.360 --> 1:38:36.200]  women wear hoods over their heads and her slaves but they still have a pride in that
[1:38:36.200 --> 1:38:42.920]  their men are going to rule this country by the sword by a la and they've had a hatred
[1:38:42.920 --> 1:38:46.600]  of this country they came here to conquer us they didn't come here to be part of it
[1:38:46.600 --> 1:39:14.920]  let's go ahead and roll that clip
[1:39:14.920 --> 1:39:32.520]  so there you go ladies and gentlemen that's the reality you know what let's let's queue
[1:39:32.520 --> 1:39:38.280]  it back up can we queue up the new member of the denver city council who says any means
[1:39:38.280 --> 1:39:42.200]  necessary for a communist overthrow of the government and then we'll play de blasio
[1:39:42.200 --> 1:39:48.600]  but i want to get tuckers comments on the mother calls where he says oh there's plenty
[1:39:48.600 --> 1:39:53.000]  of money we just haven't taken it from the people yet the big bankers are all offshore
[1:39:53.000 --> 1:39:57.960]  they're the ones financing this warren buffett was the biggest recipient of the banker bailout
[1:39:57.960 --> 1:40:07.080]  487 billion juicies oh but he mails a few thousand dollars a year to the treasury because
[1:40:07.080 --> 1:40:12.360]  he pays two little taxes that's because he pays a hundred thousand a year on his billions you
[1:40:12.360 --> 1:40:16.920]  heard me right less than one tenth one percent because he takes them all in capital gains then
[1:40:16.920 --> 1:40:22.440]  rolls it over to new companies and then he says we need taxes on the rich which means the general
[1:40:22.440 --> 1:40:29.960]  public because he gets your money but see warren buffett is a eugenicist
[1:40:29.960 --> 1:40:40.120]  and his father was a very important congressman so was billy malin the gates foundation's daddy
[1:40:40.920 --> 1:40:49.720]  billy boy's dad dad find out about him and army intelligence and cold springs harbor
[1:40:50.520 --> 1:40:58.200]  and adolf hitler but they're all the liberals and they're the ones financing and running all of it
[1:40:58.200 --> 1:41:06.920]  right now here you go here's a uh here's a club i i don't believe that our current economic system
[1:41:06.920 --> 1:41:13.560]  actually works um capitalism by design is extractive and in order to generate profit
[1:41:13.560 --> 1:41:19.000]  in a capitalist system something has to be exploited that's land labor or resources
[1:41:19.000 --> 1:41:24.360]  and i think that we're in late phase capitalism and we know it doesn't work and we've got to move
[1:41:24.360 --> 1:41:29.800]  into something new and i believe in community ownership of land labor resources and distribution
[1:41:29.800 --> 1:41:36.440]  of those resources and so whatever that morphs into i think is what will serve community the
[1:41:36.440 --> 1:41:43.400]  best and i'm excited to usher it in it by any means necessary candy debacle within a crazy
[1:41:43.400 --> 1:41:48.280]  murder eyes at the end now everybody's trying to get into what's left the capitalism that you're
[1:41:48.280 --> 1:41:53.400]  collapsing but you sit up there probably never worked a day in your life being installed because
[1:41:53.400 --> 1:42:00.600]  you're woke and you you got crazy eyes and you're saying violent overthrow oh and we've got joe biden
[1:42:01.480 --> 1:42:06.920]  saying uh we'll get to that next but but first let's get to the mayor de Blasio saying basically
[1:42:06.920 --> 1:42:12.200]  the same damn thing here it is criminalized desperation and you thought this was your
[1:42:12.200 --> 1:42:16.920]  country just because like your ancestors you were born here just because you pay half your
[1:42:16.920 --> 1:42:21.400]  income to the government to keep the whole thing going you thought it was your country think again
[1:42:21.400 --> 1:42:27.560]  racist america belongs to the rest of the world your job is to shut up and pay for it complain
[1:42:27.560 --> 1:42:33.640]  and we'll punish you bill de Blasio often makes that point under blasio the single worst mayor
[1:42:33.640 --> 1:42:40.120]  in the 400 year history of new york city that's impressive but how did he wind up on a presidential
[1:42:40.120 --> 1:42:46.280]  debate stage last night god knows maybe he illegally immigrated there doesn't matter he was there
[1:42:46.280 --> 1:42:51.560]  and once he had the mic de Blasio promised to seize your money and give it to his supporters stay there
[1:42:52.280 --> 1:42:55.800]  we'll be right back i'm gonna come back with this and more than your phone calls i'm alex jones
[1:42:57.880 --> 1:43:02.200]  i talk about this on the air and i know it sinks into people but i've decided that we're gonna
[1:43:02.200 --> 1:43:06.040]  kind of reboot all our supplements in that if you go back five six years ago before all the
[1:43:06.040 --> 1:43:10.200]  censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits the rest of it i would talk about how great the products
[1:43:10.200 --> 1:43:14.040]  are and how they were the best and why they were and i'd have doctors on an experts to explain why
[1:43:14.040 --> 1:43:18.200]  they were so good and instead the last few years i'm like hey we need to really support us or they'll
[1:43:18.200 --> 1:43:21.320]  shut us down the biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are
[1:43:21.320 --> 1:43:26.280]  and how wonderful they work and the left always has headlines everywhere jones sells unapproved
[1:43:26.280 --> 1:43:32.680]  supplements that he claims are supplements no under federal law since 1996 you can't say that a
[1:43:32.680 --> 1:43:36.680]  supplement has been through the fda because they have no jurisdiction it won't look at it but then
[1:43:36.680 --> 1:43:41.080]  they say you've got to say it's not approved by them and all drugs are is the system trying to
[1:43:41.080 --> 1:43:44.920]  tweak what's in mother nature and manipulate it and do different things and a lot of drugs work
[1:43:44.920 --> 1:43:49.320]  great they have side effects not with mother nature but big pharma doesn't want you knowing about
[1:43:49.320 --> 1:43:55.960]  god's medicine chest info war store dot com or triple eight two five three three one three nine
[1:43:57.800 --> 1:44:04.520]  info wars the most banned network in the world so the info wars model is a self-fulfilling
[1:44:04.520 --> 1:44:09.080]  self-supporting structure that is promoting free press and free speech by people getting
[1:44:09.080 --> 1:44:14.200]  together and supporting one another and sustaining one another it is the only independent press of
[1:44:14.200 --> 1:44:19.720]  this size and scale of this public reach it is the one model that says here's a way to have a
[1:44:19.720 --> 1:44:25.000]  self-supporting self-sustaining self-structured little d democratic structure that because the
[1:44:25.000 --> 1:44:29.400]  audience determines what content goes up the audience determines what audience is ultimately
[1:44:29.400 --> 1:44:33.560]  reached by their choices and supporting info wars and it's all because the audience spends
[1:44:33.560 --> 1:44:37.560]  there whatever it is whether it's five dollars or fifty dollars a month on products that they
[1:44:37.560 --> 1:44:41.960]  like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate driven model and the ability to do
[1:44:41.960 --> 1:44:47.160]  that and at the same time support press support speech support letting the audience choose what
[1:44:47.160 --> 1:44:51.560]  news they want to see and what views they want to hold and it's the ultimate american democratic
[1:44:51.560 --> 1:44:56.280]  expression and experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets

[1:47:41.640 --> 1:47:48.840]  but i want to quantify something right now the best way to document this mathematically is to
[1:47:48.840 --> 1:47:56.920]  go online and find numbers usa famous gumball examples of this going back 15 years 10 years
[1:47:56.920 --> 1:48:06.600]  five years ago they've been updating it there's about 7.65 billion in the world 6 billion of those
[1:48:06.600 --> 1:48:15.160]  people roughly live in the third world it's more like 6.8 billion or more so out of the 7
[1:48:15.960 --> 1:48:17.880]  billion 650 million people
[1:48:17.880 --> 1:48:28.360]  world less than 800 million live in the first world and much of the first world is now
[1:48:28.360 --> 1:48:34.200]  basically third world we're talking making a dollar a day sewage running down the streets
[1:48:35.240 --> 1:48:41.880]  no education people very warlike high crime civilization is hard to set up and it's hard
[1:48:41.880 --> 1:48:50.840]  to keep going you could take in hundreds of millions of people a year to europe and the
[1:48:50.840 --> 1:48:58.360]  us it would not even be half of the increase of the third world did you hear me our country's only
[1:48:58.360 --> 1:49:05.480]  really like 350 million we could take in 100 million a year europe could take in 100 million
[1:49:05.480 --> 1:49:13.560]  russia could take in 100 million that wouldn't be half the increase every year next hour at the
[1:49:13.560 --> 1:49:17.560]  bottom of the eye i'm going to play a numbers usa breakdown with gumballs and these are facts this
[1:49:17.560 --> 1:49:24.360]  isn't like we're seeing in goes here's all the lies truck told 50 000 gumballs total life these
[1:49:24.360 --> 1:49:32.920]  are real numbers real people that's coming up next hour and so you bring in a whole bunch of
[1:49:32.920 --> 1:49:37.480]  muslims and of course it's the radical ones that want power they merge with the left it's all hate
[1:49:37.480 --> 1:49:43.160]  america hate christianity talk and the universities are teaching communism because the big banks want
[1:49:43.160 --> 1:49:46.680]  that because they want you poor and stupid they don't want a bunch of businesses and wealthy people
[1:49:46.680 --> 1:49:51.960]  to compete with they want a crony capitalist system where they merge communism with crony
[1:49:51.960 --> 1:49:58.760]  capitalism that's what all de Blasio and the new you know lady debaca uh in in in denver are saying
[1:49:58.760 --> 1:50:04.200]  they said oh well obama remember before he left office went to latin america gave speeches and
[1:50:04.200 --> 1:50:08.680]  said you need communism in your country but multinationals won't be communist they partner
[1:50:08.680 --> 1:50:12.120]  and people are like well that sounds yeah rich people above the law worth trillions
[1:50:12.840 --> 1:50:17.480]  and then you're a communist and started death that's what russia was from the beginning
[1:50:17.480 --> 1:50:26.440]  run by the west the Rothschilds put the bolsheviks in it's on record and russia for 85 years was a
[1:50:26.440 --> 1:50:32.920]  slave of the globalist and that's what america slated for ladies and gentlemen so i want to tell
[1:50:32.920 --> 1:50:37.080]  you the left ever gets back in power there'll be no republican party ever you're gonna have to leave
[1:50:37.080 --> 1:50:42.440]  the us and i don't want to abandon texas but we've almost lost it i don't want to abandon the us
[1:50:42.440 --> 1:50:47.160]  but but here's the thing if america won't fight now when they're banning the american flag of the
[1:50:47.160 --> 1:50:52.440]  ninth circuit and americans won't act now when they're saying babies can be killed after born
[1:50:52.440 --> 1:50:57.240]  and americans won't act now when the democrats say everything's free if you come here but the
[1:50:57.240 --> 1:51:01.720]  citizens got to pay that means the citizens are slaves you don't have benefits to citizen it's a
[1:51:01.720 --> 1:51:08.680]  negative then you'll never fight people all of the un comes down my street all the un's already here
[1:51:08.680 --> 1:51:12.920]  unesco runs all this trumps trying to pull us out but his own people aren't following the orders
[1:51:13.480 --> 1:51:18.040]  cutting the central american funding offs good that made mexico behave itself cutting mexico's
[1:51:18.040 --> 1:51:23.400]  funding off they put troops down there they're stopping the caravans now because the borders

[1:52:18.760 --> 1:52:24.200]  and they're using these third world people they've already exploited but guess what the elites aren't
[1:52:24.200 --> 1:52:30.120]  letting folks in they've all run to kawaii hawaii where they keep the land prices so high i couldn't
[1:52:30.120 --> 1:52:34.600]  even afford to move there and they're all moving to tasmania they're all moving to new zealand
[1:52:34.600 --> 1:52:38.200]  and they're not letting anybody in that isn't skilled you want to get into socialist new zealand

[1:52:49.000 --> 1:53:01.160]  street folks just a year ago wasn't like this every street i drive down when i drive to work 15 miles
[1:53:01.160 --> 1:53:09.400]  i see homeless camps every two miles i told you one morning was particularly bad there were
[1:53:09.400 --> 1:53:16.280]  homeless zombie drugheads running around on a major highway i saw cars almost hit them and the
[1:53:16.280 --> 1:53:21.240]  police were just walking around like they were in a twilight zone dealing with this i don't know
[1:53:21.240 --> 1:53:27.480]  what was going on in the woods off of 360 and 290 but let me tell you the police looked like they'd
[1:53:27.480 --> 1:53:33.480]  seen a ghost and all i know is there were half naked men running around looked like they've been
[1:53:33.480 --> 1:53:41.640]  in a concentration camp because they're on so many drugs by the way burning tenders said white
[1:53:41.640 --> 1:53:46.120]  people don't know what it's like to be poor the burning time to know most the homeless people
[1:53:46.120 --> 1:53:55.720]  i see are white unbelievable here let's finish up tucker carlson and then i'm gonna go to your
[1:53:55.720 --> 1:54:01.880]  calls i promise here it is criminalized desperation and you thought this was your country just because
[1:54:01.880 --> 1:54:06.680]  like your ancestors you were born here just because you pay half your income to the government to
[1:54:06.680 --> 1:54:12.120]  keep the whole thing going you thought it was your country think again racist america belongs to
[1:54:12.120 --> 1:54:18.360]  the rest of the world your job is to shut up and pay for it complain and will punish you build a
[1:54:18.360 --> 1:54:24.840]  blasio often makes that point under blasio the single worst mayor in the 400 year history of
[1:54:24.840 --> 1:54:29.960]  new york city that's impressive but how did he wind up on a presidential debate stage last night
[1:54:29.960 --> 1:54:35.960]  god knows maybe he illegally immigrated there doesn't matter he was there and once he had the mic
[1:54:35.960 --> 1:54:41.560]  to blasio promised to seize your money and give it to his supporters who he explained deserve it
[1:54:41.560 --> 1:54:47.640]  much more than you do yes we're supposed to be for 70 tax rate on the wealthy you hear folks say
[1:54:47.640 --> 1:54:51.400]  there's not enough money what i say to them every single time is there's plenty of money in this
[1:54:51.400 --> 1:54:58.120]  world there's plenty of money this country it's just in the wrong hands and then let's play more
[1:54:58.120 --> 1:55:03.240]  of what tucker said after that because tucker goes you understand we're taking your property we're
[1:55:03.240 --> 1:55:06.840]  taking your guns we're taking everything you got that's how this works you go well why would they
[1:55:06.840 --> 1:55:11.160]  do a communist system when it always destroys everything because they take the money offshore
[1:55:12.040 --> 1:55:16.120]  once left us get a country they collapse it and it's called the exploitative phase
[1:55:16.120 --> 1:55:20.840]  they then exploit that country against the next country they're conquering
[1:55:22.520 --> 1:55:26.920]  un controlled countries in total squalor and death they set up refugee centers and then move
[1:55:26.920 --> 1:55:31.800]  them towards the next country general benton k parton former head of air force weapons development

[1:58:54.200 --> 1:58:58.440]  air i talked to a lot of people here out in new york city and one thing i could tell you is that
[1:58:58.440 --> 1:59:03.160]  almost nobody agrees with these wars i think that the neocons are trying desperately to get
[1:59:03.160 --> 1:59:07.800]  trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the
[1:59:07.800 --> 1:59:12.520]  eyes of the public the approaching 2020 that's it i mean if trump buys into this it'll be the end
[1:59:12.520 --> 1:59:16.200]  of his presidency it's the only way i think he can be defeated other than assassinating him it's
[1:59:16.200 --> 1:59:20.120]  the time to be praying my friend i agree entirely and the last thing i just want to say alex is i
[1:59:20.120 --> 1:59:24.600]  know they're trying to shut you down but the reinforcements have arrived man i would love to

[2:01:02.760 --> 2:01:11.560]  you know what because it's it's it's clear our worst analysis is true we really have a giant
[2:01:11.560 --> 2:01:15.480]  horde of america haters they've got that are financed that are trying to take us down and

[2:01:28.600 --> 2:01:33.240]  especially but my other grandfather would talk about texas or america or hear the star spain
[2:01:33.240 --> 2:01:38.200]  old banner get a little tear in their eye and it was because they realized how tenuous it was
[2:01:38.200 --> 2:01:43.160]  and how much how easy it could be to collapse they've been all the world and now i know about
[2:01:43.160 --> 2:01:47.160]  all the same stuff and i get tears in my eyes because and i'll tell you man they got some

[2:01:57.560 --> 2:02:03.000]  that are on board with the evil because this can destroy their future too why the hell would anybody
[2:02:03.000 --> 2:02:08.840]  want to be a part of something like the new world order it's pure evil it's pure death and we've
[2:02:08.840 --> 2:02:14.600]  got to come together and we've got to stop it that's info war's mission a pro human future

[2:02:18.520 --> 2:02:25.800]  that is so key all right let's go ahead and let's go to kevin we'll go to lauren everybody else
[2:02:25.800 --> 2:02:32.440]  kevin in new hampshire on the air welcome thank you alex thank you for taking my call um i just
[2:02:32.440 --> 2:02:36.840]  want to call in regarding the antifa attacks um and actually have a new step for you guys
[2:02:36.840 --> 2:02:42.920]  that was telling your operator over the weekend not only was there the attacks in portland but
[2:02:42.920 --> 2:02:47.000]  in the finance the three organizers of the straight pride parade which is going to happen in boston
[2:02:47.560 --> 2:02:51.560]  were doxxed and sent suspicious letters and it sounds like there were bomb threats
[2:02:51.560 --> 2:02:58.280]  since the fbi had to call in bomb squads you know i saw that and meant to cover it what was the
[2:02:58.280 --> 2:03:05.080]  headline straight pride parade sent threatening letters that's right suspicious envelopes um all
[2:03:05.080 --> 2:03:11.560]  i think the three cities were salisbury malden and woeburn right along the statewide new hampshire
[2:03:11.560 --> 2:03:15.320]  i know it's a completely different state that's a little close to home and let's think about this
[2:03:16.040 --> 2:03:19.960]  owens had him pull guns on him i know a lot of folks have been attacked and hit we had him throw
[2:03:19.960 --> 2:03:25.320]  rotting urine and feces on us when i went down to an event demonizing me uh that the city was
[2:03:25.320 --> 2:03:30.120]  sponsoring my name was it was the propaganda of donald trump and alex shones and i went and they
[2:03:30.120 --> 2:03:36.280]  they missed me partially and hit oh and with a balloon full of the most stinking stuff i've ever
[2:03:36.280 --> 2:03:43.000]  smelled and this is a terror group threatening everyone doxxing everyone and doing this and and
[2:03:43.000 --> 2:03:48.280]  so for every report i know about i always learned about 20 more later yeah there it is boston seven
[2:03:48.280 --> 2:03:52.840]  suspicious envelopes sent to organizers of straight pride parade so the left has gone to full terror
[2:03:52.840 --> 2:04:00.040]  mode right and i actually know of one of those guys i was in the queens with his um used to sell a
[2:04:00.040 --> 2:04:04.200]  lot of three percent merge not a fascist bowing the guy's body army veteran salt to the earth
[2:04:05.000 --> 2:04:10.280]  so yeah let's be clear gay pride has become anti-straight and and pro-pedophilic and a
[2:04:10.280 --> 2:04:15.240]  lot of homosexuals admit that so people have a right to have a straight pride parade and so
[2:04:15.240 --> 2:04:20.360]  the establishment doesn't like it they want to threaten you exactly but you know what
[2:04:20.360 --> 2:04:25.240]  i check the federal statutes and new hampshire is a constitutional carry state thank god i already
[2:04:25.240 --> 2:04:32.840]  do and um i know that they're the in spite of massachusetts being as a blue dog as they come
[2:04:32.840 --> 2:04:37.560]  there are a lot of veterans and governors in that state they do it all luckily and i check
[2:04:37.560 --> 2:04:41.160]  hold on stay there don't hang up kevin i want you to recap this and let's grab one of those
[2:04:41.160 --> 2:04:46.360]  newscasts i'm at the cover that days ago folks we always say hey we're not extremists hey we just
[2:04:46.360 --> 2:04:51.960]  we everybody gets that we know that and i know that places like austin has election fraud but
[2:04:51.960 --> 2:04:58.200]  we're not really a blue city same thing with massachusetts it's not only that you have a unique
[2:04:58.200 --> 2:05:02.600]  voice in the public arena in the public square the other thing that's unique about info wars is
[2:05:02.600 --> 2:05:07.560]  is it isn't the only network of this reach that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate
[2:05:07.560 --> 2:05:11.960]  sugar daddy that's not backed by some billionaire that's not being funded by secrets foreign
[2:05:11.960 --> 2:05:17.560]  government it is completely independent of all that it is an old school american 1776 style
[2:05:17.560 --> 2:05:21.720]  experiment in the expression of the freedom of press and freedom of speech that in fact the
[2:05:21.720 --> 2:05:25.880]  founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country they actually tried to support and
[2:05:25.880 --> 2:05:30.200]  subsidize organizations just like this because this was the kind of press they wanted and then
[2:05:30.200 --> 2:05:34.360]  ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations or
[2:05:34.360 --> 2:05:38.600]  billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to control and manipulate what news and views
[2:05:38.600 --> 2:05:43.400]  view a person is allowed to have or express or hear and the info wars audience has broken through
[2:05:43.400 --> 2:05:47.960]  that the uh that they are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate american
[2:05:47.960 --> 2:05:52.440]  democracy and freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the platforming
[2:05:52.440 --> 2:06:11.480]  defamation lawfare and libel targeting you you are listening to an info wars dot com

[2:10:22.760 --> 2:10:35.240]  homosexuals are so oppressed totally made up yes there's been a practice called rolling people
[2:10:35.240 --> 2:10:40.760]  where college types would say let's go outside the gay bar and beat up some gay guys and take
[2:10:40.760 --> 2:10:47.480]  their wallets that's gone stuff you see like a boogie nights really happened okay well nobody's
[2:10:47.480 --> 2:10:53.480]  saying do that that doesn't mean then you get to have your way with our kids and attach pedophilia
[2:10:53.480 --> 2:10:57.720]  to your sexual preference and that's what's happened here and we've hit rock bottom where
[2:10:57.720 --> 2:11:02.120]  most girls sports are now dominated i said i go to your calls let's go to him uh kevin we've got
[2:11:02.120 --> 2:11:06.760]  the newscast you mentioned it's not just the acid attacks in portland the acid attacks they
[2:11:06.760 --> 2:11:11.560]  say are coming in the form that you lie american flags being pulled the left's telling us you will
[2:11:11.560 --> 2:11:15.640]  not celebrate america you'll pay and you won't celebrate being christian or being straight
[2:11:16.440 --> 2:11:21.320]  even though the the the parade is prostrated itself and said oh we'll have milo unopolis
[2:11:21.320 --> 2:11:25.160]  leading it as the gay guy we we're not against you we're just saying it's okay to be us they're
[2:11:25.160 --> 2:11:33.560]  like no nothing's enough we're gonna attack you tell us about it well i haven't heard much about
[2:11:33.560 --> 2:11:39.480]  it myself but it sounds like completing total hypocrisy and again just this whole fear tactic
[2:11:39.480 --> 2:11:45.560]  thing that they're trying but like i was saying before we had to go to break um as blue as people
[2:11:45.560 --> 2:11:50.520]  think massachusetts is that's only mostly around that i've seen the major city area if you go out to
[2:11:50.520 --> 2:11:56.200]  west of boston the rest of the countryside of massachusetts and it's a little more libertarian you might
[2:11:56.200 --> 2:12:00.280]  find a few actual trump supporters and their signs out in their yard i've seen them sure they just
[2:12:00.280 --> 2:12:03.880]  know you get intimidated they know that you get attacked and that's what i'm telling you there's
[2:12:03.880 --> 2:12:07.880]  nobody really wants blue cities except a few mental patients and the people that rule you
[2:12:07.880 --> 2:12:13.320]  they always have election fraud in blue cities has been proven they just admitted a 1.5 million
[2:12:13.320 --> 2:12:22.520]  fake voters in california we were right judicial watch this one lawsuit right and in regards to
[2:12:22.520 --> 2:12:28.360]  all the attacks by antifa and all that alex i'm not trying to kiss your ass here but it's clear
[2:12:28.360 --> 2:12:34.680]  because the president is now taking action on big tech after your repeal petitioning again not
[2:12:34.680 --> 2:12:40.600]  kissing your ass but clearly you have this year i think you need to start making demands that although
[2:12:40.600 --> 2:12:46.760]  new jersey has recognized anti-veteran organization it needs to be federal they need to be treated as
[2:12:46.760 --> 2:12:52.200]  such well i agree with you and it's not bragging it's like it's like marching around the general's
[2:12:52.200 --> 2:12:57.560]  outfit and a war on the front line it's not fun so i'm up here with like three stars on the enemy's
[2:12:57.560 --> 2:13:02.520]  all shooting at me and i but but it it's definitely true that trump listens because of this audience
[2:13:03.160 --> 2:13:08.280]  and because he respects the audience he sees all the shirts and his rallies the informer shirts
[2:13:08.280 --> 2:13:13.720]  and he listens and his sons listen and we've had a lot of private conversations i'll leave it that i
[2:13:13.720 --> 2:13:19.080]  mean it's no secret the president has told me intensify press the attack you're doing a great
[2:13:19.080 --> 2:13:23.240]  job and you know he tweets out our stuff even though his staff freaks out i mean basically
[2:13:23.240 --> 2:13:27.960]  general kelly quit over myself and a few other things and that's fine good riddance i had the
[2:13:27.960 --> 2:13:33.480]  cia defense department some of their elements threatened me when that happened uh that i need
[2:13:33.480 --> 2:13:38.200]  to watch out involved in their command and control well if you're command and control can't get the
[2:13:38.200 --> 2:13:41.960]  border fixed and if you're command and control can't do this then you're not american get the
[2:13:41.960 --> 2:13:45.880]  hell out of the way if you're command and control can't get apple and google to stop selling the
[2:13:45.880 --> 2:13:50.040]  chai comms get out of the way it doesn't mean the whole pentagon but there are elements in there
[2:13:50.040 --> 2:13:55.800]  put in by the clinton's and the bushes uh that uh do not like trump being in charge i guess what
[2:13:55.800 --> 2:14:00.920]  he's the president now he's actually in command the problem is they're not following the orders
[2:14:00.920 --> 2:14:06.840]  so it's it's a real crisis god bless you i appreciate your call let's play some of that news
[2:14:06.840 --> 2:14:13.000]  clip then we'll go to uh laura and andy and others right after the break uh here's part of local

[2:24:05.800 --> 2:24:10.760]  you and i could tell you this my neighbor burned his finger a little bit we're built in a fire
[2:24:10.760 --> 2:24:15.240]  outside and i ran inside and got it and put it on his finger and he said to me is this supposed
[2:24:15.240 --> 2:24:21.400]  to work instantly and like this and i said yep sure does so it it's fantastic stuff i highly
[2:24:21.400 --> 2:24:29.320]  recommend it um and i wanted to talk about aoc and the democrats at the border and to basically
[2:24:29.320 --> 2:24:34.760]  my thinking is they're like a wild animal caught in a snare or they're like they're you're you're
[2:24:34.760 --> 2:24:39.000]  metaphysically have your hands around this rope and they're really starting to feel the squeeze
[2:24:39.000 --> 2:24:44.360]  and then they just act wilder and wilder and say crazier and crazier things because they're struggling
[2:24:44.360 --> 2:24:50.680]  they know that we can see them clearly and know you know the demonic influences that they have
[2:24:50.680 --> 2:24:57.560]  over them and that we are not going to buy what they're selling anymore and they count aoc especially
[2:24:57.560 --> 2:25:02.600]  counts on the press to cover for her and she's counting on these new illegal immigrants to
[2:25:02.600 --> 2:25:06.600]  support her and the democrats and they're just pushing and pushing and pushing but they're getting
[2:25:06.600 --> 2:25:12.840]  crazier because they know that they're they're found out that's what i think and i also believe
[2:25:12.840 --> 2:25:19.080]  that it's good if we see nothing but what's coming a year from now i agree with you what why do you
[2:25:19.080 --> 2:25:24.360]  think nike obviously is a pr stunt hired capri with all his anti america stuff okay that's their
[2:25:24.360 --> 2:25:30.680]  that's their issue they ship out these shoes that have the original colonial flag created by mrs
[2:25:30.680 --> 2:25:37.000]  washington on them and then they go oh you're right capri to complain always empowering the tattling
[2:25:37.000 --> 2:25:45.320]  empowering the sjw in uh empowering the righteous you know indignation outrage mobs so that oh we're
[2:25:45.320 --> 2:25:50.040]  pulling it you don't like the flag to get other people now to start complaining about the flag
[2:25:50.040 --> 2:25:57.240]  i mean this is just crazy either that or it's possible since they are crazy you can never
[2:25:57.240 --> 2:26:01.560]  know what's going to set them off and so they're just reactionary what oh that's that you off okay
[2:26:01.560 --> 2:26:06.760]  we'll pull it that it could be either or because honestly they operate on the level of crazy that
[2:26:06.760 --> 2:26:12.680]  you can't predict well i agree with you and nike is now selling the shoes first is that they were
[2:26:12.680 --> 2:26:18.120]  pulled for $2,500 a piece so they're all about creating prestige in a shoe so they're getting
[2:26:18.120 --> 2:26:24.360]  on the anti american man wagon but then making money out of it while they do it well i can assure
[2:26:24.360 --> 2:26:28.600]  you that i'll never buy another product nike product again so they i guess they better sell
[2:26:28.600 --> 2:26:33.720]  those shoes for that much well it's it's the perfect sjw that'll go get two or three worthless
[2:26:33.720 --> 2:26:37.880]  college degrees not all degrees are worthless but they get the worthless ones that they all want
[2:26:37.880 --> 2:26:42.360]  the $300 $400 shoes and so it's perfect that they'll probably buy these themselves now because
[2:26:42.360 --> 2:26:48.680]  whatever's the most prestigious as a symbol of status they'll get it's just crazy what do you
[2:26:48.680 --> 2:26:54.920]  think about the whole situation with aoc saying she basically got sexually assaulted and even
[2:26:54.920 --> 2:27:00.200]  the media wouldn't fully quote her trying to protect her i mean she's becoming crazier and crazier
[2:27:00.200 --> 2:27:05.080]  saying women are drinking out of toilets and she's not going to put up with it meanwhile the company
[2:27:05.080 --> 2:27:11.640]  that brought her down there is actually financing and controlling the land and making money with

[2:32:04.840 --> 2:32:09.240]  for their illicit activities over two decades and because of that that's why the courts the judges

[2:35:04.920 --> 2:35:09.400]  we wouldn't be here it's really unprecedented that the establishment has tried and failed to
[2:35:09.400 --> 2:35:16.440]  silence us and take us out okay who's been holding the longest here where i try to go boom boom boom
[2:35:16.440 --> 2:35:22.120]  let's go to andy in indiana let's talk about antifa and all their terror attacks and more thank
[2:35:22.120 --> 2:35:29.000]  you andy for calling thanks for taking my call alex i called today to talk about the frustration
[2:35:29.000 --> 2:35:35.160]  that i've got that like every few weeks you turn on the tv and you see a prayer group attacked or
[2:35:35.160 --> 2:35:43.240]  some other patriot organization and you see almost zero response by local government but also federal
[2:35:43.240 --> 2:35:52.280]  government as well and i wanted to get your take on what we can do as patriots to get the federal
[2:35:52.280 --> 2:35:58.120]  government to wake up and start protecting us citizens that are also donald trump supporters
[2:35:58.120 --> 2:36:02.920]  out of these events well you notice the left always calls conservatives or christians or
[2:36:02.920 --> 2:36:07.560]  nationalist bullies and say they're victims but then they're actually the bullies show the police
[2:36:07.560 --> 2:36:11.800]  and government are scared of corporate media they're scared of the big banks that finance it
[2:36:11.800 --> 2:36:17.480]  and so until there's some courage we've seen that from trump and from our listeners but other than
[2:36:17.480 --> 2:36:27.080]  that you know drudge has helped until we see that uh they're gonna still be able to intimidate people
[2:36:27.080 --> 2:36:32.040]  and you've got the new york times the washington post cnn they're all defending antifuzz heroes
[2:36:32.680 --> 2:36:37.640]  you're saying hey right wing is racist you need a radiation treatment we're gonna come hit you in
[2:36:37.640 --> 2:36:43.320]  the head and try to kill you so they've just rationalized what all authoritarians do they
[2:36:43.320 --> 2:36:47.880]  dehumanize you uh before they attack you and it's just going to get worse and worse and worse
[2:36:48.600 --> 2:36:53.000]  and they keep testing and seeing that no one's doing anything so uh it's it's it's going to get
[2:36:53.000 --> 2:36:59.160]  bad and then if they force somebody to fight back and kill them they'll be victims uh if they can
[2:36:59.160 --> 2:37:05.000]  keep pushing and nobody stands up to them well then they're fine with that too uh and so that's
[2:37:05.000 --> 2:37:11.000]  really the game plan here but we have we must understand their entire world program we must
[2:37:11.000 --> 2:37:16.360]  understand who they are and we must explain it to others so they get the end game i thought this
[2:37:16.360 --> 2:37:21.880]  is an overthrow of the country then you're gonna see some real movement against these groups but
[2:37:22.440 --> 2:37:28.440]  despite the fact that the right wing or the nationalist movement is passive we still are awake
[2:37:28.440 --> 2:37:32.760]  and that's what they recognize and that's what they understand that their power is waning
[2:37:32.760 --> 2:37:38.040]  that's why they're trying to intimidate us
[2:37:41.720 --> 2:37:46.200]  do you agree with that andy have points to add no no i i totally agree with that
[2:37:46.840 --> 2:37:50.600]  you know every time i see a video where someone gets hit with a numb truck across the head and
[2:37:50.600 --> 2:37:54.680]  they're to a point where they got to get stitches you know these groups see this and they say
[2:37:55.240 --> 2:38:00.040]  no one's doing anything about it and my fear is that every every new and keep a group that goes
[2:38:00.040 --> 2:38:05.320]  out there is more involved and there's more of them that that show up to these events because
[2:38:05.320 --> 2:38:12.200]  there is other than three arrests which i'm i'm sure the charges weren't that much uh there's no
[2:38:12.200 --> 2:38:19.480]  repercussion for their action and donald trump does know who and he's talked about him you know
[2:38:19.480 --> 2:38:25.960]  i think it's time that we have more of a national focus uh and led by him not just led by alex
[2:38:25.960 --> 2:38:32.040]  john no i totally agree with you and the callers keeps saying that trump has to act on censorship
[2:38:32.040 --> 2:38:38.040]  trump has to act on antifa uh attacking people but we the people have to put pressure on i mean
[2:38:38.040 --> 2:38:43.880]  take andy no conservative journalist he's asian he gets hit in the head with with an acid attack
[2:38:43.880 --> 2:38:47.960]  burns his eye he gets hit in the head with concrete he gets hit in the back with clubs
[2:38:48.600 --> 2:38:54.920]  head bleeding eye bleeding but the media chose him because it was the least bad there are videos
[2:38:54.920 --> 2:39:01.880]  and photos of people with 30 stitches head split open teeth falling out media doesn't talk to them
[2:39:03.000 --> 2:39:07.480]  and so again it's always minimized i'm not saying tucker carlson's doing this but
[2:39:08.040 --> 2:39:12.440]  fox news basically provides them who's going to come on and it's much worse it should be
[2:39:12.440 --> 2:39:18.600]  headline not journalist attack by antifa it should be antifa launches chemical attack in portland
[2:39:18.600 --> 2:39:27.000]  pledges more acid attacks in dc thank you so much andy gray points what what do i do what do you do
[2:39:31.080 --> 2:39:38.040]  i mean and i'm not belittling uh doctor know here what happened to him i am simply talking about
[2:39:38.040 --> 2:39:44.760]  it was far worse i don't even see fox the only station covering it show people with clubs hammering
[2:39:44.760 --> 2:39:52.440]  heads and maybe i'm missing it cnn's defending it uh hubbin post is defending it they're trying
[2:39:52.440 --> 2:39:57.880]  to get a fight going so they can play victim that's all this is because they know we have a conscience
[2:39:58.440 --> 2:40:03.560]  okay charles charles in georgia you're on the air thanks for holding welcome
[2:40:04.600 --> 2:40:09.320]  hey elix hey listen uh everything that's going on at the border everything going on with antifa
[2:40:09.320 --> 2:40:14.040]  everything going on with aoc's little propaganda skip this week uh it's all tied to the bigger
[2:40:14.040 --> 2:40:20.040]  operation we know that which is to steal the 2020 election yes you know that outright i know how
[2:40:20.040 --> 2:40:25.160]  trump can solve the problem in five minutes tell us real simple all he has to do is issue
[2:40:25.160 --> 2:40:30.760]  an executive order banning all executive branch employees including military personnel from
[2:40:30.760 --> 2:40:38.120]  having accounts on facebook twitter google youtube properties oh issue guidance issue guidance on
[2:40:38.120 --> 2:40:42.200]  what social media they're allowed to use whether employed by the executive branch there's not
[2:40:42.200 --> 2:40:46.200]  a single thing crooked judges can do about it because it's an executive branch order
[2:40:46.200 --> 2:40:52.360]  to executive branch employees now three things will happen one trump can move over from twitter
[2:40:52.360 --> 2:40:55.960]  over to parlor or something like that or gab i don't work there i'm not endorsing i'm just saying
[2:40:55.960 --> 2:41:01.880]  pick another one and when he goes over there the whole world will follow him and the military over
[2:41:01.880 --> 2:41:06.280]  those other platforms the people will start getting the truth because everyone will follow
[2:41:06.280 --> 2:41:12.360]  everybody over there and the uh real information about what's going on with uh the border and
[2:41:12.360 --> 2:41:17.240]  antifa will no longer be censored so everyone will start seeing it trump will end up with a net
[2:41:17.240 --> 2:41:22.040]  gain of followers and by because he's not being shadow banned anymore like he talked about with
[2:41:22.040 --> 2:41:27.320]  maria broadoromo uh last week so what do you know sir you're a genius and i'm gonna stop you right
[2:41:27.320 --> 2:41:33.880]  there i have to cut a voiceover for an emergency message to the president that myself and robert
[2:41:33.880 --> 2:41:42.360]  barns cut yesterday and in that i call for the president to announce other social media that
[2:41:42.360 --> 2:41:47.240]  he's going to be supporting like parlor and like gab and a couple others that brad park
[2:41:47.240 --> 2:41:51.720]  skelz been talking about the head of the campaign but to also go further just like he banned
[2:41:52.440 --> 2:41:57.720]  huawei from military bases because it's globalist it's been proven to be tied into foreign
[2:41:57.720 --> 2:42:03.720]  governments it's a national security risk because apple and google and facebook and all of them
[2:42:03.720 --> 2:42:08.840]  have been caught working with china and working with other countries to steal data they shouldn't
[2:42:08.840 --> 2:42:14.200]  be allowed to be used by federal employees or by military personnel so i'm going to come back
[2:42:14.200 --> 2:42:19.320]  from break so you have the floor because this was supposed to air the sour i i just have to go
[2:42:19.320 --> 2:42:25.000]  approve it we're going to take the clip of what you say at the end say and by the way while we
[2:42:25.000 --> 2:42:29.080]  were producing this we had a call saying the exact same thing and i'm going to put a clip of you at
[2:42:29.080 --> 2:42:33.400]  the end and the president doesn't like to watch stuff longer in five minutes for me this thing's
[2:42:33.400 --> 2:42:39.080]  already 10 minutes long but it doesn't matter his people will watch it and so i'm going to tag
[2:42:39.080 --> 2:42:44.360]  your message on charles the president will be come back don't hang up i'm going to come back and
[2:42:44.360 --> 2:42:49.400]  i'm going to recap the interviews and erupt and say charles uh you say you've got a way for trump
[2:42:49.400 --> 2:42:53.880]  to stop this all in five minutes and i agree with you it's a devastating idea it's beautiful
[2:42:53.880 --> 2:43:00.040]  so briefly folks please do not forget this is the maximum alert we wouldn't be here without you i thank
[2:43:00.040 --> 2:43:03.720]  you for your support and your help we're going to be steadfast in this fight but we need financial

[2:43:53.480 --> 2:44:01.080]  we're not going to back down info wars the most banned network in the world so the info wars model
[2:44:01.080 --> 2:44:06.440]  is a self-fulfilling self supporting structure that is promoting free press and free speech by
[2:44:06.440 --> 2:44:11.560]  people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining one another it is the only independent
[2:44:11.560 --> 2:44:17.080]  press of this size and scale of this public reach it is the one model that says here's a
[2:44:17.080 --> 2:44:22.040]  way to have a self supporting self sustaining self-structured little d democratic structure
[2:44:22.040 --> 2:44:26.920]  that because the audience determines what content goes up the audience determines what audience is
[2:44:26.920 --> 2:44:31.480]  ultimately reached by their choices and supporting info wars and it's all because the audience spends
[2:44:31.480 --> 2:44:36.280]  there whatever it is whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want
[2:44:36.280 --> 2:44:40.840]  that actually compete with the corporate driven model and the ability to do that and at the same
[2:44:40.840 --> 2:44:46.120]  time support press support speech support letting the audience choose what news they want to see
[2:44:46.120 --> 2:44:50.200]  and what views they want to hold and it's the ultimate american democratic expression and
[2:44:50.200 --> 2:44:54.280]  experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets
[2:44:57.240 --> 2:45:01.640]  i just want listeners understand money is what allows us to beat this and stand against this
[2:45:01.640 --> 2:45:06.840]  and we're seeing a lot of orders right now with the save info wars 50 off but we make only like
[2:45:06.840 --> 2:45:11.160]  five ten dollars on higher marked up stuff we're making like two dollars on the toothpaste at that
[2:45:11.160 --> 2:45:15.960]  price and we're moving a ton of it okay but you move a couple hundred thousand dollars or something and
[2:45:15.960 --> 2:45:19.720]  you get twenty thousand dollars that doesn't pay for all the infrastructure the bandwidth the lawyers
[2:45:19.720 --> 2:45:24.200]  the crew so we need to sell millions and millions and millions of dollars of product i want to expand
[2:45:24.200 --> 2:45:28.600]  not contract and for six months we've not just made a standstill the enemy's been winning and i
[2:45:28.600 --> 2:45:33.480]  have labored and labored and labored and labored on this i like to be expanding i like to be
[2:45:33.480 --> 2:45:37.080]  winning i like to be fighting and we are winning the info war that's why we're so hated but we need
[2:45:37.080 --> 2:45:41.400]  to be retreaded we need to be tuned up we need to be fixed up we never have time to get in the
[2:45:41.400 --> 2:45:46.760]  drive up we got a lot of holes shot at us and the enemy wants to silence us then they're really
[2:45:46.760 --> 2:45:50.440]  going to plant child porn on us then they're going to kill me or you or anybody else i mean the
[2:45:50.440 --> 2:45:54.680]  democrats now are going into a full revolutionary fervor funded by foreign banks in the chai com so
[2:45:54.680 --> 2:46:00.040]  go to mfullworkstore.com we'll be very very clear with everybody about all of this we're going into
[2:46:00.040 --> 2:46:04.600]  the season of war and they have been inches from shutting down the final mega counts we have
[2:46:04.600 --> 2:46:08.760]  do their criminal activity and their and their digital fraud and we need to know that we've
[2:46:08.760 --> 2:46:13.480]  got capital to go six months a year we need to end here we need to be provisioned and you've
[2:46:13.480 --> 2:46:18.760]  got my total commitment that i am going to rampage forward against the enemy fearlessly i'm 11 every
[2:46:18.760 --> 2:46:23.480]  minute of this because i know i'm getting under their skin i'm bloody and then i'm up politically
[2:46:23.480 --> 2:46:27.960]  i'm banging heads with them and they can't help but attack back with lies that just brings more
[2:46:27.960 --> 2:46:33.000]  people here so i'm in one hell of a fight and so are you and i need war bonds i need gas i need
[2:46:33.000 --> 2:46:37.880]  ammo politically now but literally if you flood us with money and if you flood us with product
[2:46:37.880 --> 2:46:41.960]  purchases and if you flood us with your word of mouth you're unstoppable we're unstoppable together
[2:46:41.960 --> 2:46:45.320]  i want to send a strong message to the enemy i want to raise a couple million dollars right
[2:46:45.320 --> 2:46:49.560]  now to let the enemy know that their attacks are failing and that you will stand with us and i will
[2:46:49.560 --> 2:46:54.120]  never back down you have my commitment this only gives me more energy and more understanding of
[2:46:54.120 --> 2:47:10.040]  what we're facing and that we were right about this you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:47:25.080 --> 2:47:34.040]  me
[2:47:34.040 --> 2:47:54.600]  All right, it was supposed to be done today.
[2:47:54.600 --> 2:47:58.120]  I dropped the ball this morning, didn't do the final voiceover for it.
[2:47:58.120 --> 2:48:03.400]  We're going to release it in the morning, I'm going to play it on tomorrow's show.
[2:48:03.400 --> 2:48:08.120]  And so much is happening, I was going to take off July 4th and take the kids fishing again,
[2:48:08.120 --> 2:48:10.640]  but I think I'm going to probably work it out with somebody to come in there with a
[2:48:10.640 --> 2:48:14.800]  skeleton crew because there's going to be major fireworks with the Antifa promising
[2:48:14.800 --> 2:48:16.600]  all these terror attacks across the country.
[2:48:16.600 --> 2:48:22.440]  But I shot an emergency report to the president that we were going to release today.
[2:48:22.440 --> 2:48:24.680]  As I said, we're going to release tomorrow now.
[2:48:24.680 --> 2:48:31.520]  But the caller just said exactly something that I said in the piece with Barnes.
[2:48:31.520 --> 2:48:37.320]  Because Barnes had said, cut off federal funding to any project with big tech, just like Trump's
[2:48:37.320 --> 2:48:39.960]  threatened to do with the universities with executive order.
[2:48:39.960 --> 2:48:44.440]  And we go further, he could bar military personnel from using it like he's done in
[2:48:44.440 --> 2:48:45.440]  Huawei.
[2:48:45.440 --> 2:48:48.520]  And again, judges can't do a damn thing about that.
[2:48:48.520 --> 2:48:52.280]  You notice the Supreme Court keeps ruling with the president, but lower courts don't.
[2:48:52.280 --> 2:48:53.360]  So it's all fraudulent.
[2:48:53.360 --> 2:48:58.040]  So Charles, I'm going to add to the end of this report now what you said.
[2:48:58.040 --> 2:49:01.000]  So I'm going to say it right now, live on air, but we're going to add it to the tape.
[2:49:01.000 --> 2:49:07.560]  And Mr. President, when we finished filming this emergency report to you, I was live on
[2:49:07.560 --> 2:49:13.040]  air and took a call from this gentleman who laid out the same idea that we had.
[2:49:13.040 --> 2:49:15.480]  So I think many minds think alike.
[2:49:15.480 --> 2:49:18.720]  I think you really should look at taking action on this front.
[2:49:18.720 --> 2:49:20.480]  Charles, I held you over.
[2:49:20.480 --> 2:49:24.600]  Please repeat from Georgia to the president in D.C. what you were saying.
[2:49:24.600 --> 2:49:29.400]  Well, we all know what the bigger operation is with the border, with Antifa, with the
[2:49:29.400 --> 2:49:30.400]  whole thing.
[2:49:30.400 --> 2:49:32.640]  And it's to steal the 2020 election.
[2:49:32.640 --> 2:49:33.640]  It's my opinion.
[2:49:33.640 --> 2:49:36.760]  I don't think the executive branch in the White House or the military have any business
[2:49:36.760 --> 2:49:41.400]  being on platforms that are censoring, shadow banning, and outright banning half the country,
[2:49:41.400 --> 2:49:43.480]  our troops fight and die for those rights.
[2:49:43.480 --> 2:49:48.000]  So I suggested that the president should just simply issue an executive order banning all
[2:49:48.000 --> 2:49:53.080]  executive branch employees, military personnel, and contractors working with the executive
[2:49:53.080 --> 2:50:00.360]  branch from having accounts on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, Google properties,
[2:50:00.360 --> 2:50:04.640]  while they're employed for the executive branch, and issue guidance on what social media platforms
[2:50:04.640 --> 2:50:07.720]  are acceptable.
[2:50:07.720 --> 2:50:11.440]  I think a year from now, on the heat of the election, Twitter will no longer have any
[2:50:11.440 --> 2:50:15.360]  power if they exist at all.
[2:50:15.360 --> 2:50:18.840]  When the president and the entire military personnel and all their friends follow them
[2:50:18.840 --> 2:50:24.680]  over to the other platforms, that will allow all the information to get out to the American
[2:50:24.680 --> 2:50:29.360]  people because all of Trump's followers, including himself, nobody will be shadow banned anymore.
[2:50:29.360 --> 2:50:32.600]  So the real information will get out to the people on those other platforms.
[2:50:32.600 --> 2:50:34.040]  So it'll be a devastating blow.
[2:50:34.040 --> 2:50:36.240]  No more censorship, no more shadow banning.
[2:50:36.240 --> 2:50:38.360]  And on the internet, traffic is power.
[2:50:38.360 --> 2:50:43.200]  And Twitter, if they still exist a year from now, will have none.
[2:50:43.200 --> 2:50:46.840]  And Facebook and Google and YouTube will be reeling because the whole world will follow
[2:50:46.840 --> 2:50:49.120]  him and the military over to those other platforms.
[2:50:49.120 --> 2:50:50.440]  And that will be the end of the censorship.
[2:50:50.440 --> 2:50:53.200]  Well, it really wants to hit him with one, two punch.
[2:50:53.200 --> 2:50:59.240]  If he's real smart, he'll pull all of Silicon Valley's H1B visas so we no longer have millions
[2:50:59.240 --> 2:51:03.160]  of imports over there doing the evil bidding of these people because they have no concept
[2:51:03.160 --> 2:51:04.160]  of the Constitution.
[2:51:04.160 --> 2:51:06.000]  That would be the end of it right there.
[2:51:06.000 --> 2:51:11.040]  Charles, I'm very impressed with your call because you just laid out everything we basically
[2:51:11.040 --> 2:51:13.400]  thought to tell the president and did.
[2:51:13.400 --> 2:51:18.920]  We said, look at taking away those skilled visas from big tech if they're using people
[2:51:18.920 --> 2:51:22.520]  from authoritarian countries like China who follow orders.
[2:51:22.520 --> 2:51:29.640]  We said strip away federal funding to these platforms, contracts, or advertising.
[2:51:29.640 --> 2:51:33.880]  We also said don't let military personnel, because these companies are worse than Huawei,
[2:51:33.880 --> 2:51:34.880]  use it.
[2:51:34.880 --> 2:51:39.320]  I didn't think all federal employees, as he could do with an executive order, expanding
[2:51:39.320 --> 2:51:40.320]  on that.
[2:51:40.320 --> 2:51:42.480]  Wow, you just laid it all out.
[2:51:42.480 --> 2:51:43.480]  And there it is.
[2:51:43.480 --> 2:51:48.840]  And imagine the imagery that you can't visit these sites because they're not letting American
[2:51:48.840 --> 2:51:54.320]  citizens visit other sites, these are authoritarians, and we're letting everybody know that these
[2:51:54.320 --> 2:51:56.120]  are bad guys.
[2:51:56.120 --> 2:52:00.640]  And then also, it'll just bring them to their knees, and there's no antitrust needed, no
[2:52:00.640 --> 2:52:05.080]  lawsuits needed, just a simple exercise of constitutional power.
[2:52:05.080 --> 2:52:06.840]  That is a beautiful idea.
[2:52:06.840 --> 2:52:12.080]  Well, what will happen is if the whole world moves over to other platforms, they will follow
[2:52:12.080 --> 2:52:13.080]  Trump.
[2:52:13.080 --> 2:52:14.440]  The whole country will follow him in the military.
[2:52:14.440 --> 2:52:17.680]  They will follow him over to the other platforms, they'll have to, because it won't be on Twitter
[2:52:17.680 --> 2:52:19.960]  anymore, it'll be on Parler, Gab, or one of the other ones.
[2:52:19.960 --> 2:52:21.480]  And that was the last most important point.
[2:52:21.480 --> 2:52:26.400]  I know the president is looking, Brad Parskels is looking, they have a summit coming up in
[2:52:26.400 --> 2:52:33.860]  just nine days in D.C., where they're looking at promoting new platforms, and Trump wants
[2:52:33.860 --> 2:52:38.840]  to know which ones he should promote as a way to draw people away from Twitter, YouTube,
[2:52:38.840 --> 2:52:40.360]  Facebook, all of it.
[2:52:40.360 --> 2:52:43.000]  And so that really is another ace in the hole we've got.
[2:52:43.000 --> 2:52:45.560]  One thing's for sure, this is going to be an incredible time to be alive.
[2:52:45.560 --> 2:52:49.520]  Charles, I'm getting a whole list of callers, I think are the best callers, to start hosting
[2:52:49.520 --> 2:52:51.680]  a Saturday show with us when people want to do it.
[2:52:51.680 --> 2:52:54.600]  So please stay there, write your name and number, see if you can join us coming up this
[2:52:54.600 --> 2:52:58.480]  Saturday for the kickoff of the soon-to-be-named broadcast.
[2:52:58.480 --> 2:53:01.080]  We'll start doing every Saturday with the callers.
[2:53:01.080 --> 2:53:04.120]  We may move it to another day, but I'm going to get it started, I've had this idea for
[2:53:04.120 --> 2:53:05.120]  a long time.
[2:53:05.120 --> 2:53:09.440]  Well, that caller was on target, so we'll take some clips out of that, put it on the
[2:53:09.440 --> 2:53:12.480]  message to the president, because that's it.
[2:53:12.480 --> 2:53:16.080]  That's exactly what we're saying, and that's what needs to be done.
[2:53:16.080 --> 2:53:17.280]  This is very exciting.
[2:53:17.280 --> 2:53:22.120]  Okay, who's been holding the longest here now?
[2:53:22.120 --> 2:53:30.240]  Let's go ahead and take a call from Joe in California, then Kevin.
[2:53:30.240 --> 2:53:31.240]  Joe, you're on the air.
[2:53:31.240 --> 2:53:32.240]  Thanks for holding.
[2:53:32.240 --> 2:53:33.240]  Hello, Alex.
[2:53:33.240 --> 2:53:35.240]  How are you doing today?
[2:53:35.240 --> 2:53:36.240]  Good, brother.
[2:53:36.240 --> 2:53:37.240]  Hey, Alex.
[2:53:37.240 --> 2:53:44.240]  I wanted to say to you that when history presents itself, that you are one of the most important
[2:53:44.240 --> 2:53:50.760]  people that this country's ever had, as far as getting the word out, making the truth
[2:53:50.760 --> 2:53:52.960]  of what's going on in our country.
[2:53:52.960 --> 2:53:57.680]  And I want to thank you for that, because 15 years ago, or maybe 12 years ago, when
[2:53:57.680 --> 2:54:01.160]  I started listening to you, I didn't know idea what was going on.
[2:54:01.160 --> 2:54:05.240]  And now people, when I talk to people, they think I'm crazy, and I just tell them, here's
[2:54:05.240 --> 2:54:06.240]  the fact.
[2:54:06.240 --> 2:54:08.360]  And I'm educating people.
[2:54:08.360 --> 2:54:12.960]  My family thought I was crazy for a long time, but now they're really educated on what's
[2:54:12.960 --> 2:54:13.960]  going on.
[2:54:13.960 --> 2:54:17.520]  But what I really wanted to talk to you about is two things.
[2:54:17.520 --> 2:54:19.400]  Your products are incredible.
[2:54:19.400 --> 2:54:21.880]  I've been using them for the last five years.
[2:54:21.880 --> 2:54:25.520]  I'm 49 years old, soon to be 50.
[2:54:25.520 --> 2:54:27.080]  And I was out of shape.
[2:54:27.080 --> 2:54:31.400]  I was in shape for a long time in my life, but I got out of shape, gained about 40 pounds.
[2:54:31.400 --> 2:54:37.160]  And I started taking bone broth and the supermael vitality, and I'll tell you one thing.
[2:54:37.160 --> 2:54:39.880]  My body looks like it's about 30 years old.
[2:54:39.880 --> 2:54:45.560]  I get all the time people ask me what my age is, and they tell me 49, they'd call me a
[2:54:45.560 --> 2:54:46.560]  liar.
[2:54:46.560 --> 2:54:49.200]  The supermael, the bone broth, the colloidal silver.
[2:54:49.200 --> 2:54:52.720]  I give my kids colloidal silver if they got a cold within a day or so.
[2:54:52.720 --> 2:54:55.080]  They don't have that cold anymore.
[2:54:55.080 --> 2:54:59.440]  My blood pressure has went from high to low, and the doctors keep asking me what I'm taking.
[2:54:59.440 --> 2:55:03.000]  So I want to commend you on making the best product out there.
[2:55:03.000 --> 2:55:06.320]  And I went through a lot of products, and I don't think anything's better than yours.
[2:55:06.320 --> 2:55:08.640]  Well, I appreciate your support.
[2:55:08.640 --> 2:55:10.960]  And again, I'll just tell you the truth.
[2:55:10.960 --> 2:55:13.120]  I know supplements work of their high quality.
[2:55:13.120 --> 2:55:15.520]  I'm the worst at not taking them.
[2:55:15.520 --> 2:55:18.760]  And so I go through cycles where I take them, and then I lose all this weight and get healthy,
[2:55:18.760 --> 2:55:20.720]  and then I stop taking them.
[2:55:20.720 --> 2:55:24.120]  And I'm like, how do I get myself to take my own supplements?
[2:55:24.120 --> 2:55:27.360]  It funds the operation, plus they're good for me, and I just have to put them on a lazy
[2:55:27.360 --> 2:55:33.240]  Susan at the dinner table, and then always somebody moves it for Thanksgiving or something.
[2:55:33.240 --> 2:55:37.200]  And my wife doesn't like it, so it doesn't go back up there, and then I stop taking everything.
[2:55:37.200 --> 2:55:40.720]  And then as soon as I go back on supplements, like I did two weeks ago, things start getting
[2:55:40.720 --> 2:55:41.720]  better again.
[2:55:41.720 --> 2:55:44.440]  So yes, these are the very best supplements out there, and they fund the Second American
[2:55:44.440 --> 2:55:45.440]  Revolution.
[2:55:45.440 --> 2:55:48.040]  So thank you so much, Joe, for those kind words.
[2:55:48.040 --> 2:55:52.520]  What do you make of just the open borders, AOC's latest lies?
[2:55:52.520 --> 2:55:56.040]  If she doesn't get in trouble for saying women are drinking out of toilets and that she got
[2:55:56.040 --> 2:56:00.560]  assaulted by the guards, I mean, what's she going to make up next, that the world's going
[2:56:00.560 --> 2:56:01.560]  to end in 12 years?
[2:56:01.560 --> 2:56:03.280]  Oh, I guess she already did that.
[2:56:03.280 --> 2:56:07.280]  Alex, I think this whole thing is a bunch of comicals, it's like Clown World, just like
[2:56:07.280 --> 2:56:08.440]  you said.
[2:56:08.440 --> 2:56:13.520]  These people are, it's amazing that we have some stupid people in this country that believe
[2:56:13.520 --> 2:56:15.400]  the crap that these people are throwing out.
[2:56:15.400 --> 2:56:19.320]  I've never seen the dumber people in my life, but you know what, the younger, millennium
[2:56:19.320 --> 2:56:23.960]  people, I'm not saying that they're dumb, but they have no concept of what's going on
[2:56:23.960 --> 2:56:24.960]  in this world.
[2:56:24.960 --> 2:56:28.560]  The specialists is great and everything is for free, they don't want to work.
[2:56:28.560 --> 2:56:29.560]  I don't know.
[2:56:29.560 --> 2:56:32.360]  Well, it's like they're not human, they could be white, they could be black, they could
[2:56:32.360 --> 2:56:34.720]  be Hispanic and I'm not trying to be mean.
[2:56:34.720 --> 2:56:38.200]  Most of the real weirdos are white, the lefts always bash in whites, I guess I got to agree.
[2:56:38.200 --> 2:56:42.520]  These weird leftists are like demons and they think they're going to win and they think
[2:56:42.520 --> 2:56:46.000]  they're about to take over, the globalists aren't going to give them money or power if
[2:56:46.000 --> 2:56:47.000]  they take over.
[2:56:47.000 --> 2:56:51.920]  No, nobody's going to give them nothing, they're just, it's a smoke and mirrors thing.
[2:56:51.920 --> 2:56:55.880]  But Alex, I want to touch real quick on something, I have a four-year-old and a seven-year-old
[2:56:55.880 --> 2:57:00.200]  in school and when they were born, we didn't vaccinate them.
[2:57:00.200 --> 2:57:06.480]  They are so smart and so outgoing and we got the exemption from the doctor for my seven-year-old
[2:57:06.480 --> 2:57:12.720]  and then the four-year-old going into pre-teen or pre-kindergarten and when they asked school
[2:57:12.720 --> 2:57:19.080]  asked us to bring them the immunization report, we said we had a doctor's pass on that and
[2:57:19.080 --> 2:57:25.040]  we had the school nurse tell my wife, well, we're going to see if we accept it, if we
[2:57:25.040 --> 2:57:28.760]  don't, you know, they're going to have to look at another school and then she started
[2:57:28.760 --> 2:57:29.760]  going in to say.
[2:57:29.760 --> 2:57:31.640]  Hold on, stay there, your call is critical.
[2:57:31.640 --> 2:57:36.480]  I know the rigmarole, they have a file, they have a playbook on how to con you and violate
[2:57:36.480 --> 2:57:37.960]  your civil rights, you should sue them.
[2:57:37.960 --> 2:57:42.800]  Okay, I'm going to explain how criminal this is of these public schools, they get money
[2:57:42.800 --> 2:57:43.800]  when you're vaccinated.
[2:57:43.800 --> 2:57:47.800]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York, Marcus you're on the air, thanks for holding.
[2:57:47.800 --> 2:57:51.560]  Hey, Alex, yeah, I just want to say, your show is a breath of fresh air, I talked to
[2:57:51.560 --> 2:57:55.440]  a lot of people here out in New York City and one thing I can tell you is that almost
[2:57:55.440 --> 2:57:57.240]  nobody agrees with these wars.
[2:57:57.240 --> 2:58:01.640]  I think that the Neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know
[2:58:01.640 --> 2:58:06.040]  that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public, the approaching
[2:58:06.040 --> 2:58:07.040]  2020.
[2:58:07.040 --> 2:58:10.080]  That's it, I mean if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency, it's the
[2:58:10.080 --> 2:58:13.240]  only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him, it's the time to
[2:58:13.240 --> 2:58:14.240]  be praying my friend.
[2:58:14.240 --> 2:58:17.320]  I agree entirely and the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying
[2:58:17.320 --> 2:58:20.240]  to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[2:58:20.240 --> 2:58:24.040]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old, I would love to see what you're
[2:58:24.040 --> 2:58:28.000]  talking about when you're 80, but if they do shut you down, no, you've gone into this
[2:58:28.000 --> 2:58:33.240]  war, you've won a lot of battles and there are a lot of people like myself and many others
[2:58:33.240 --> 2:58:36.800]  who are going to continue, we're going to keep fighting in the input war and even if
[2:58:36.800 --> 2:58:41.040]  something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of
[2:58:41.040 --> 2:58:43.000]  people fired up for liberty.
[2:58:43.000 --> 2:58:47.280]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[2:58:47.280 --> 2:58:54.240]  Working with Info Wars is a great honor, but I still need my morning coffee and luckily
[2:58:54.240 --> 2:58:59.480]  our break room at the Info Wars headquarters is stocked full of high quality Info Wars

[2:59:41.680 --> 2:59:49.320]  At infowarstore.com.
[2:59:49.320 --> 2:59:53.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:59:53.120 --> 3:00:10.080]  All right, folks, evil's coming out of the closet, Alex Jones here, Tom Pappert, great
[3:00:10.080 --> 3:00:14.880]  writer for bigleaguepolitics.com, TV station manager that we're on, great Patriot, he's
[3:00:14.880 --> 3:00:20.000]  taking over 15 after him and trying to get to Jesse and George and Josh and Tim and
[3:00:20.000 --> 3:00:26.640]  Carl before we end this, before I punch you out so that Tom Pappert can take over.
[3:00:26.640 --> 3:00:30.640]  They set up eugenics boards in the 20s in England and the U.S. Hitler didn't pick it
[3:00:30.640 --> 3:00:33.080]  up until the 30s in Germany.
[3:00:33.080 --> 3:00:36.760]  They sterilized you if you had a low IQ, they sterilized you if you had bad scores, didn't
[3:00:36.760 --> 3:00:41.960]  have you were black or white or Hispanic, if they caught you with marijuana, they sterilized
[3:00:41.960 --> 3:00:43.520]  you.
[3:00:43.520 --> 3:00:47.640]  And it was local health departments were run by the federal government and the racial
[3:00:47.640 --> 3:00:50.560]  hygiene department.
[3:00:50.560 --> 3:00:56.480]  And ever since then, public schools get their federal funding tied to them, what they do.
[3:00:56.480 --> 3:00:59.880]  So now there's over 60 vaccines they want to force you to take.
[3:00:59.880 --> 3:01:00.880]  Many of them dangerous.
[3:01:00.880 --> 3:01:04.680]  All of them give liability protection to the companies that make them.
[3:01:04.680 --> 3:01:06.920]  No other drugs are like that.
[3:01:06.920 --> 3:01:12.120]  And so they get their money, about a third of their money generally is tied to not just
[3:01:12.120 --> 3:01:14.400]  attendance, but to vaccination.
[3:01:14.400 --> 3:01:17.920]  So the school nurses have a playlist, oh, your kid's going to die.
[3:01:17.920 --> 3:01:18.920]  Oh, you're bad.
[3:01:18.920 --> 3:01:19.920]  Oh, you're crazy.
[3:01:19.920 --> 3:01:22.840]  You better find another school bluffing you.
[3:01:22.840 --> 3:01:26.960]  All 50 states have laws that it's not the law you got to be vaccinated, but they want
[3:01:26.960 --> 3:01:30.840]  you to follow a policy to get a waiver that you follow the health department.
[3:01:30.840 --> 3:01:31.840]  So there's a list of anti-vaxxers.
[3:01:31.840 --> 3:01:36.120]  Then they're going to claim, oh, you're making me sick because you're not vaccinated.
[3:01:36.120 --> 3:01:41.280]  Wait, you've had the vaccine supposedly you're impossible for you to get sick.
[3:01:41.280 --> 3:01:42.280]  So it's all a hoax.
[3:01:42.280 --> 3:01:43.280]  It's all a fraud.
[3:01:43.280 --> 3:01:47.080]  You bring up to ski experiment, put the cephalos they injected in black people via vaccines.
[3:01:47.080 --> 3:01:53.760]  You bring a best V 40 and the human papillomavirus you bring up how they put cancer viruses in
[3:01:53.760 --> 3:01:55.320]  the polio vaccines.
[3:01:55.320 --> 3:01:57.320]  They'll shut their mouths up real quick.
[3:01:57.320 --> 3:01:59.440]  So they just don't think you know you're right.
[3:01:59.440 --> 3:02:02.560]  So vaccine makers have got this intimidation line.
[3:02:02.560 --> 3:02:06.280]  You say, listen, I know you're violating my rights, the law.
[3:02:06.280 --> 3:02:10.320]  And then you should organize at the PTA go speak at the PTA about it.
[3:02:10.320 --> 3:02:12.080]  And they'll all shut up and leave you alone real quick.
[3:02:12.080 --> 3:02:15.080]  They want to isolate you, make you feel alone.
[3:02:15.080 --> 3:02:18.720]  So did I just guess what they said to you because they follow a playbook?
[3:02:18.720 --> 3:02:19.720]  Oh, yeah.
[3:02:19.720 --> 3:02:23.480]  So, so when I went in there, of course, my wife didn't say anything and I went in there
[3:02:23.480 --> 3:02:26.440]  and I said, look, we don't have to vaccinate our kids.
[3:02:26.440 --> 3:02:27.440]  We have the right.
[3:02:27.440 --> 3:02:30.360]  We don't believe what's in the vaccines is healthy.
[3:02:30.360 --> 3:02:33.080]  And she said, oh, well, you know, this is a law.
[3:02:33.080 --> 3:02:34.560]  And I said, it is not a law.
[3:02:34.560 --> 3:02:39.840]  And I said, basically, you're violating my, you know, my, my right.
[3:02:39.840 --> 3:02:43.480]  And she said, well, we have to report the kids that are not on them.
[3:02:43.480 --> 3:02:44.480]  And I said, well, what does that mean?
[3:02:44.480 --> 3:02:48.520]  She says, well, you know, someday they're going to, they're going to take the kids and
[3:02:48.520 --> 3:02:50.520]  inoculate them without you.
[3:02:50.520 --> 3:02:51.520]  Exactly.
[3:02:51.520 --> 3:02:52.520]  And that's true.
[3:02:52.520 --> 3:02:56.520]  They under her regulations on a law, it's all the same health department.
[3:02:56.520 --> 3:03:00.680]  And they say you must give us the list of anti-vaxxers like you're a criminal.
[3:03:00.680 --> 3:03:05.280]  And then in New York, they did it this year with the Orthodox Jews are smart.
[3:03:05.280 --> 3:03:09.600]  And they know these vaccines are dangerous because they seem to have convulsions or kids.
[3:03:09.600 --> 3:03:12.640]  So they forcibly came to inoculate them.
[3:03:12.640 --> 3:03:15.200]  And then that's, and that's, that's Mayor de Blasio.
[3:03:15.200 --> 3:03:18.280]  Yeah, Alex, I got a question for you.
[3:03:18.280 --> 3:03:19.280]  I own my own business.
[3:03:19.280 --> 3:03:20.280]  I have time.
[3:03:20.280 --> 3:03:24.600]  I'm not looking for a job, but I'm looking to possibly help use the reporting for you
[3:03:24.600 --> 3:03:26.100]  guys out here in LA.
[3:03:26.100 --> 3:03:28.200]  There's, there's nothing going on out here.
[3:03:28.200 --> 3:03:29.200]  Nobody's talking about it.
[3:03:29.200 --> 3:03:31.440]  Sir, send us a resume, send us your plan.
[3:03:31.440 --> 3:03:34.920]  The best thing is start your own YouTube, start doing your own reporting with a hundred
[3:03:34.920 --> 3:03:36.480]  dollar camera and a $10 mic.
[3:03:36.480 --> 3:03:37.480]  Doesn't matter.
[3:03:37.480 --> 3:03:38.480]  People do good reports.
[3:03:38.480 --> 3:03:39.480]  You kick ass.
[3:03:39.480 --> 3:03:43.080]  We might have a little bit of payment to give folks or people get up and on their feet.
[3:03:43.080 --> 3:03:47.160]  We've got some tips to help folks monetize, but send us your information, call us and
[3:03:47.160 --> 3:03:48.160]  God bless you.
[3:03:48.160 --> 3:03:49.160]  I'm out of time.
[3:03:49.160 --> 3:03:50.160]  Okay.
[3:03:50.160 --> 3:03:51.400]  I'm going to try to jam in as many calls as I can.
[3:03:51.400 --> 3:03:52.400]  We come back.
[3:03:52.400 --> 3:03:53.400]  I want to explain something.
[3:03:53.400 --> 3:03:55.760]  I know you all already know this.
[3:03:55.760 --> 3:03:57.640]  We got about 158,000 people.
[3:03:57.640 --> 3:03:59.720]  They're catching a month coming in.
[3:03:59.720 --> 3:04:01.000]  That's people that want to turn themselves in.
[3:04:01.000 --> 3:04:03.320]  The board patrol is totally overwhelmed.
[3:04:03.320 --> 3:04:06.760]  Got the Democrats under Obama that set up all these emergency centers and called with
[3:04:06.760 --> 3:04:10.360]  the open border, which then the private groups own to make money off of.
[3:04:10.360 --> 3:04:12.160]  That's not the board patrol.
[3:04:12.160 --> 3:04:13.520]  So Democrats make money off this.
[3:04:13.520 --> 3:04:16.080]  Then once they get them in, they put them on welfare.
[3:04:16.080 --> 3:04:17.080]  They feed on them.
[3:04:17.080 --> 3:04:19.840]  Well, it's the same thing with the vaccines.
[3:04:19.840 --> 3:04:24.000]  They're making money off every child that gets vaccinated at the local health department
[3:04:24.000 --> 3:04:29.060]  and city level and they're lying to you and when they bring in all these illegal aliens
[3:04:29.060 --> 3:04:32.200]  who have all these diseases and things and then it spreads from them, which they admit,
[3:04:32.200 --> 3:04:36.080]  they then turn around the unvaccinated when they brought in the disease people and tell
[3:04:36.080 --> 3:04:37.080]  you it's your fault.
[3:04:37.080 --> 3:04:40.880]  It's all fraud and having this information will stop them.
[3:04:40.880 --> 3:04:46.080]  That was a natural news article on this right now, exclusive Google to block all anti-cancer,
[3:04:46.080 --> 3:04:52.640]  anti-vax and anti-GMO websites at the browser level as tech giant goes all in with pharma

[3:06:02.640 --> 3:06:31.480]  Trashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[3:06:31.480 --> 3:06:33.600]  You're supposed to just sit there and take it.
[3:06:33.600 --> 3:06:38.840]  Big article up on Infowars.com is from NaturalNews.com.
[3:06:38.840 --> 3:06:44.640]  Exclusive, Google to block all anti-cancer, anti-vax and anti-GMO websites at the browser
[3:06:44.640 --> 3:06:45.640]  level.
[3:06:45.640 --> 3:06:52.080]  URL blocking now, folks, as tech giant goes all in with big pharma cartels.
[3:06:52.080 --> 3:06:53.080]  Big story.
[3:06:53.080 --> 3:06:55.000]  I want to get Mike on tomorrow about that.
[3:06:55.000 --> 3:06:57.480]  This is just getting so crazy, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:06:57.480 --> 3:07:03.600]  Meanwhile, there's a new Miley Cyrus video that fits in with all the calls for human
[3:07:03.600 --> 3:07:11.240]  sacrifice and death and killing babies, and it's her having sex, her having her uterus
[3:07:11.240 --> 3:07:18.120]  cut out, her rolling around with obese women, everything to the file, the female form, everything
[3:07:18.120 --> 3:07:19.360]  to sell ugliness.
[3:07:19.360 --> 3:07:22.960]  It's a weird deal with a Hitler mustache.
[3:07:22.960 --> 3:07:30.600]  This is just Hollywood has collapsed in to pure abject evil.
[3:07:30.600 --> 3:07:35.680]  You read it, hallelujah, I'm a freak, I'm a freak, hallelujah.
[3:07:35.680 --> 3:07:43.560]  Every day of the week, I'm do you like what I do, I'm like a Nile crocodile, a piranha.
[3:07:43.560 --> 3:07:45.520]  That's right, laying in a way to attack you and kill you.
[3:07:45.520 --> 3:07:51.480]  Oh my God, she got the power, oh look at her, yeah, until she wakes up 45, no kids, no husband.
[3:07:51.480 --> 3:07:55.240]  You got the power, so, so, you don't eff with my freedom.
[3:07:55.240 --> 3:08:01.560]  I came back to get me some, I'm nasty, I'm evil, must be something in the water or in
[3:08:01.560 --> 3:08:05.800]  the vaccines that hit areas of the brain that connect with God.
[3:08:05.800 --> 3:08:12.560]  Must be something in the water or that I'm a mother's daughter, don't eff with my freedom.
[3:08:12.560 --> 3:08:18.560]  I came back to get me some, you came back, huh, I'm nasty, I'm evil, must be something
[3:08:18.560 --> 3:08:19.560]  in the water.
[3:08:19.560 --> 3:08:23.920]  I'm double speaking, I came to kill you, must be something in the water or that I'm a mother's
[3:08:23.920 --> 3:08:24.920]  daughter.
[3:08:24.920 --> 3:08:32.360]  Back up, back up, back up, boy, oh, hallelujah, I'm a witch, I'm a witch, hallelujah, swish,
[3:08:32.360 --> 3:08:38.200]  swish, I'm a three-pointed shooter, I blow through you like a hot wind out of the bayou,
[3:08:38.200 --> 3:08:46.800]  oh my God, she's got the power, wow, look, the power to die, the power to be disgusting
[3:08:46.800 --> 3:08:54.000]  and be destroyed, the power to kill your babies, because these things come from one thing.
[3:08:54.000 --> 3:08:59.680]  She says, I'm gonna get you, came back to destroy you, I'm gonna kill, steal and destroy
[3:08:59.680 --> 3:09:14.760]  you, Jezebel devil, the Jezebel spirit, AOC, all of it, Jesse in Idaho, you're on the
[3:09:14.760 --> 3:09:16.960]  air, thanks for holding.
[3:09:16.960 --> 3:09:21.720]  Alex, first of all, I am a long-term radio listener and I want to thank you for always
[3:09:21.720 --> 3:09:27.560]  putting everything into perspective for us that cannot watch on TV because I have listened
[3:09:27.560 --> 3:09:31.760]  for many years, but I've probably only watched only a couple minutes, actually, you know,
[3:09:31.760 --> 3:09:32.760]  other than on the radio.
[3:09:32.760 --> 3:09:37.320]  Well, that's good for you, I wouldn't watch MSM if I didn't have to.
[3:09:37.320 --> 3:09:43.000]  But actually, the reason I called is, I know this illegal immigration has been, you know,
[3:09:43.000 --> 3:09:47.200]  through the roof, worse than it has been, but I feel like everyone is kind of missing
[3:09:47.200 --> 3:09:53.640]  a really big green light and it's about to get worse than it has actually been.
[3:09:53.640 --> 3:09:59.200]  Oh, yeah, the illegal stuff is just probing, they're preparing the full collapse and trying
[3:09:59.200 --> 3:10:01.720]  to sell us when the full collapse comes, don't defend.
[3:10:01.720 --> 3:10:08.480]  Well, with the clown debate, I didn't see that as, you know, them offering illegals
[3:10:08.480 --> 3:10:12.040]  healthcare, because obviously during the presidential debates, it's about what's gonna
[3:10:12.040 --> 3:10:16.560]  happen when they become president, but it's what that was with the ultimate green light
[3:10:16.560 --> 3:10:21.480]  from every Democratic president, or nominee or whatever, you know, letting them know that,
[3:10:21.480 --> 3:10:26.440]  hey, if you vote for me, you will have all of this stuff and so what that's letting
[3:10:26.440 --> 3:10:30.320]  them know is you need to get here now because this needs to happen before you become president
[3:10:30.320 --> 3:10:33.440]  because we need help right now to get this done.
[3:10:33.440 --> 3:10:37.560]  Oh, yes, it's calling on the trip, get here, over on America, once you help us take it
[3:10:37.560 --> 3:10:41.040]  down, we'll redistribute all the wealth to you, we're about to bring down America and
[3:10:41.040 --> 3:10:45.080]  loot it and sack it like Rome, and of course, no nobody they bring here will get any of
[3:10:45.080 --> 3:10:46.080]  it.
[3:10:46.080 --> 3:10:49.320]  They'll get giant tent cities and piles of feces, I totally agree with you.
[3:10:49.320 --> 3:10:52.960]  But yeah, I think most people saw that as like, oh, well, we don't want to, we don't
[3:10:52.960 --> 3:10:57.120]  want a president that's gonna give healthcare, but that's just a cover, that's not what
[3:10:57.120 --> 3:11:00.640]  it's intent was, you know, it was a big green light, you know, their cars are packed and
[3:11:00.640 --> 3:11:01.960]  that was their, uh...
[3:11:01.960 --> 3:11:05.240]  Jesse, you're absolutely right, I can talk to you for 10 hours, I'm gonna move quick
[3:11:05.240 --> 3:11:08.840]  to finish with other folks, but first, as I mentioned, here's the president talking
[3:11:08.840 --> 3:11:14.280]  about Twitter censorship, possibly being illegal, here it is.
[3:11:14.280 --> 3:11:19.320]  Google, by some measures, the most powerful company in the world, all information flows
[3:11:19.320 --> 3:11:23.520]  through it, they're against you, they don't want you reelected, can you get reelected
[3:11:23.520 --> 3:11:25.000]  if Google's against you?
[3:11:25.000 --> 3:11:29.920]  So, you know, I've been hearing that about Google and Facebook and Twitter, okay?
[3:11:29.920 --> 3:11:33.840]  I won, they were totally against me, I won, and Hillary Clinton...
[3:11:33.840 --> 3:11:35.280]  But they didn't think you were gonna win.
[3:11:35.280 --> 3:11:39.200]  Well, they fought me very hard, I mean, I heard that and they're fighting me hard right
[3:11:39.200 --> 3:11:43.040]  now, which is incredible because I think the Democrats want to shut them up, and frankly
[3:11:43.040 --> 3:11:45.520]  so do a lot of the Republicans want to shut them up.
[3:11:45.520 --> 3:11:51.640]  If you look at Twitter, I have millions and millions of people on Twitter, and it's, you
[3:11:51.640 --> 3:11:57.040]  know, it's a very good arm for me, it's great social media, but they don't treat me right,
[3:11:57.040 --> 3:12:01.080]  and I know for a fact, I mean, a lot of people try and follow me and it's very hard, I have
[3:12:01.080 --> 3:12:05.840]  so many people coming up, they say, sure, it's so hard, they make it hard to follow.
[3:12:05.840 --> 3:12:11.240]  What they're doing is wrong and possibly illegal, and a lot of things are being looked at right
[3:12:11.240 --> 3:12:18.400]  now, but you're right, Google is very powerful, but I won, and a poll just came out today,
[3:12:18.400 --> 3:12:24.040]  I'm at 54 or 55, and they do say you can add 10 to whatever poll I have, okay?
[3:12:24.040 --> 3:12:27.280]  And I never get good press, I mean, I haven't had a good start, I used to get the best press
[3:12:27.280 --> 3:12:30.280]  of the world, you remember the old days when I was an entrepreneur, I used to get great
[3:12:30.280 --> 3:12:37.280]  press, now I get, because of what I stand for, represent, and nobody's ever had, I think,
[3:12:37.280 --> 3:12:41.640]  93%, it came out the other day, 93%, and I'm talking about stories that should be good,
[3:12:41.640 --> 3:12:47.760]  they make them bad, or should be great, they make them like neutral, and yet I won.
[3:12:47.760 --> 3:12:53.320]  So Trump gives what's going on, but he doesn't get the big enchilada, Mr. Trump, they game
[3:12:53.320 --> 3:12:58.840]  things, they shadow ban, they dial back, they have devastated tens of thousands of your
[3:12:58.840 --> 3:13:04.240]  most prominent supporters, shut them down, frozen the Donald subreddit, the censorship
[3:13:04.240 --> 3:13:14.600]  is, let's not exaggerate, I'd say 10,000 times more intense, and we have the metrics,
[3:13:14.600 --> 3:13:21.520]  so what they're doing is dialing you back, and it's out of control, and yes, they shadow
[3:13:21.520 --> 3:13:25.280]  ban your tweets on Twitter, so you don't get millions of retweets, you get 200,000 retweets,
[3:13:25.280 --> 3:13:29.520]  you're being blocked, people have to find your page to physically read it there, and
[3:13:29.520 --> 3:13:33.560]  all it is is a bulletin board then, people sign up to get messages from you, and they
[3:13:33.560 --> 3:13:39.880]  don't send your messages out, Mr. President, and they stick all your enemies up on top,
[3:13:39.880 --> 3:13:45.720]  so you're going through what I was going through two years ago, and now they want to totally
[3:13:45.720 --> 3:13:53.480]  ban you completely, so promote other platforms, start any trust, take away federal funds from
[3:13:53.480 --> 3:13:59.440]  these groups just like universities, and tell the military and anybody in critical infrastructure,
[3:13:59.440 --> 3:14:04.240]  you don't visit these anti-American sites, and that will crater them, use your power,
[3:14:04.240 --> 3:14:09.040]  I get the fact you're all Mr. Free Market, listen to the Heritage Foundation, that's
[3:14:09.040 --> 3:14:13.480]  a Koch Brothers neocon group, it's not libertarian to have open borders and say, oh, we're open
[3:14:13.480 --> 3:14:17.760]  borders, but then we have free welfare, and countries that don't, they come here, that's
[3:14:17.760 --> 3:14:21.800]  not free market, that's suicide, and it's the same thing with the censorship, they're
[3:14:21.800 --> 3:14:31.280]  following the orders of China and the EU, big techies, all you need to do is say no,
[3:14:31.280 --> 3:14:36.360]  you don't do that, but because we sit here paralyzed, they're going to steal that election
[3:14:36.360 --> 3:14:41.280]  bigger than Dallas from you, so don't think that's not going to happen, they've tried
[3:14:41.280 --> 3:14:45.160]  every damn shot they've got, the fake Russia gate, coming out of your family, your tax
[3:14:45.160 --> 3:14:52.640]  returns are trying to put me in prison, they're going to steal that election.
[3:14:52.640 --> 3:14:56.840]  So you understand that, Mr. President, you understand actions, the only damn thing we
[3:14:56.840 --> 3:15:00.720]  need now, you saw that Google video last week, and they say they're not going to let you
[3:15:00.720 --> 3:15:07.280]  get reelected, they mean business, and they're arrogant, and so it's not just your right
[3:15:07.280 --> 3:15:10.640]  as your duty to take action, I'm going to go to break it up, Tom Papert took over, George
[3:15:10.640 --> 3:15:13.480]  and Josh and Kevin, if you call me back tomorrow, you'll go to the very front of the line, thanks

[3:16:22.960 --> 3:16:28.360]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[3:16:28.360 --> 3:16:29.360]  the world.
[3:16:29.360 --> 3:16:32.360]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[3:16:32.360 --> 3:16:38.320]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[3:16:38.320 --> 3:16:42.120]  As former colony, the U.S. had to save the empire.
[3:16:42.120 --> 3:16:43.120]  Was there ever a vote?
[3:16:43.120 --> 3:16:44.680]  Who do we fight for?
[3:16:44.680 --> 3:16:51.240]  The deep state began with World War I, the United States of Empire, by James Dunne, available

[3:17:51.880 --> 3:17:55.440]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York.
[3:17:55.440 --> 3:17:56.440]  Marcus, you're on the air.
[3:17:56.440 --> 3:17:57.440]  Thanks for holding.
[3:17:57.440 --> 3:18:00.160]  Hey, I just wanted to say, your show is a breath of fresh air.
[3:18:00.160 --> 3:18:03.640]  I talked to a lot of people here out in New York City, and one thing I could tell you
[3:18:03.640 --> 3:18:06.280]  is that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[3:18:06.280 --> 3:18:10.680]  I think that the Neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know
[3:18:10.680 --> 3:18:14.960]  that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public, the approaching
[3:18:14.960 --> 3:18:15.960]  2020.
[3:18:15.960 --> 3:18:16.960]  That's it.
[3:18:16.960 --> 3:18:19.080]  I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[3:18:19.080 --> 3:18:21.840]  It's the only way I think he could be defeated other than assassinating him.
[3:18:21.840 --> 3:18:23.160]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[3:18:23.160 --> 3:18:24.160]  I agree entirely.
[3:18:24.160 --> 3:18:27.320]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down,
[3:18:27.320 --> 3:18:29.280]  but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[3:18:29.280 --> 3:18:32.160]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[3:18:32.160 --> 3:18:34.480]  I'd love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[3:18:34.480 --> 3:18:37.680]  But if they do shut you down, no, you've gone into this war.
[3:18:37.680 --> 3:18:42.280]  You've won a lot of battles, and there are a lot of people like myself and many others
[3:18:42.280 --> 3:18:43.600]  who are going to continue.
[3:18:43.600 --> 3:18:47.160]  We're going to keep fighting in the Info War, and even if something does happen to you or
[3:18:47.160 --> 3:18:52.040]  your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[3:18:52.040 --> 3:18:54.760]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[3:18:54.760 --> 3:18:59.520]  Info Wars and free speech and your right to speech has been under unprecedented attack
[3:18:59.520 --> 3:19:01.880]  the last year or so.
[3:19:01.880 --> 3:19:02.880]  It's Orwellian.
[3:19:02.880 --> 3:19:03.880]  It's biblical.
[3:19:03.880 --> 3:19:04.880]  It's authoritarian.
[3:19:04.880 --> 3:19:05.880]  It's insane.
[3:19:05.880 --> 3:19:11.520]  And I keep trying to judge and gauge when is the right time to have to stumble up on
[3:19:11.520 --> 3:19:16.240]  deck as the captain of this operation and say, hey, we're sinking.
[3:19:16.240 --> 3:19:18.840]  I've begged for your support before, and thanks for keeping us afloat.
[3:19:18.840 --> 3:19:22.920]  But this is the real SOS, if you don't buy a bunch of products and spread the word and
[3:19:22.920 --> 3:19:27.480]  keep fighting, Info Wars will be shut down, not just crippled.
[3:19:27.480 --> 3:19:28.480]  And so we've reached that point.
[3:19:28.480 --> 3:19:33.160]  It'll make the enemy happy, but you know, whatever, we have stood so many of their attacks.
[3:19:33.160 --> 3:19:35.680]  We've gone through so much because of your support.
[3:19:35.680 --> 3:19:37.080]  You have been there.
[3:19:37.080 --> 3:19:41.000]  But let me tell you, they are pissed they haven't been successful, and they're giving us their
[3:19:41.000 --> 3:19:42.000]  full assault.
[3:19:42.000 --> 3:19:48.000]  So we need your prayers, your financial support, and your word of mouth now at InfoWarscore.com.
[3:19:48.000 --> 3:19:49.000]  It's your fight.
[3:19:49.000 --> 3:19:56.880]  So decide whether or not you want InfoWars to continue because we could be shut down.
[3:19:56.880 --> 3:20:01.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:01.880 --> 3:20:30.160]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:30.160 --> 3:20:32.160]  This is the fourth hour.
[3:20:32.160 --> 3:20:36.040]  I am Tom Papert, your guest host here filling in for Alex Jones.
[3:20:36.040 --> 3:20:37.640]  Facebook's got him for Trump.
[3:20:37.640 --> 3:20:41.960]  So Alex left off talking about tech censorship, and of course, we're also going to discuss
[3:20:41.960 --> 3:20:42.960]  anti-puts today.
[3:20:42.960 --> 3:20:47.280]  But this is an article that just came out at Big League Politics where I write, last
[3:20:47.280 --> 3:20:54.800]  week, election interference, Twitter plans to censor President Trump allegedly rule-breaking
[3:20:54.800 --> 3:20:56.240]  tweets.
[3:20:56.240 --> 3:20:58.320]  And so this is the new plan.
[3:20:58.320 --> 3:21:02.920]  They've realized they cannot totally take him off the platform because they will be
[3:21:02.920 --> 3:21:03.920]  targeted.
[3:21:03.920 --> 3:21:08.680]  So now they're going to say, if he has a tweet that the left thinks is breaking a rule, like
[3:21:08.680 --> 3:21:14.040]  when he makes fun of Hillary Clinton or James Comey or any of these public officials that
[3:21:14.040 --> 3:21:18.720]  are absolutely fair game, they're going to put up a nice little disclaimer and say the
[3:21:18.720 --> 3:21:22.960]  Twitter rules about abusive behavior apply to this tweet.
[3:21:22.960 --> 3:21:27.800]  However, Twitter has determined that it may be in the public's best interest for the tweet
[3:21:27.800 --> 3:21:29.840]  to remain available.
[3:21:29.840 --> 3:21:35.360]  So yes, they absolutely are stepping up their game to drive President Trump's social media
[3:21:35.360 --> 3:21:37.360]  analytics down the toilet.
[3:21:37.360 --> 3:21:39.240]  And this is their big plot.
[3:21:39.240 --> 3:21:43.240]  It's the only hope they have to win in 2020, because look at who they have.
[3:21:43.240 --> 3:21:46.000]  They have Sleepy Creepy Joe Biden.
[3:21:46.000 --> 3:21:47.880]  They have Kamala Harris.
[3:21:47.880 --> 3:21:51.240]  They have Pete Butt Edge Edge.
[3:21:51.240 --> 3:21:54.120]  This is not the A team that they're assembling right now.
[3:21:54.120 --> 3:21:57.760]  They're trying to put up Elizabeth Warren, Pocahontas as the Be All Indole.
[3:21:57.760 --> 3:22:04.040]  And they know the only way the Democrats have a chance is if the Republicans, if the pro-Trump
[3:22:04.040 --> 3:22:09.080]  populace cannot do what they did last time, which is leverage social media to fight back
[3:22:09.080 --> 3:22:10.680]  against the mainstream media.
[3:22:10.680 --> 3:22:16.240]  I mean, Alex Jones and Infowars, this audience, the folks watching at home right now are in
[3:22:16.240 --> 3:22:20.960]  no small part the reason why we have President Trump.
[3:22:20.960 --> 3:22:25.440]  And they are doing everything they can to shut it down.
[3:22:25.440 --> 3:22:28.200]  And then the next article, this all just happened last week.
[3:22:28.200 --> 3:22:33.160]  Last week was possibly the most devastating week for internet freedom and the First Amendment
[3:22:33.160 --> 3:22:37.480]  since Alex Jones was taken down in August of last year.
[3:22:37.480 --> 3:22:44.560]  Tech bias, Apple tells Parler to censor free speech or lose its app.
[3:22:44.560 --> 3:22:48.080]  So now we have Apple, Tim Apple, Tim Cook.
[3:22:48.080 --> 3:22:55.360]  He's coming out and he is saying, you, your private company will abide by my private company
[3:22:55.360 --> 3:23:00.600]  rules, or else you're gone, you're out of the app store.
[3:23:00.600 --> 3:23:03.280]  Parler is a mobile first platform.
[3:23:03.280 --> 3:23:07.600]  It is designed to be used on smartphones and tablets.
[3:23:07.600 --> 3:23:13.320]  Apple of course just lost the historic Supreme Court decision where they can now actually
[3:23:13.320 --> 3:23:19.480]  be sued for this exact type of behavior, but they're still doubling down.
[3:23:19.480 --> 3:23:25.040]  And what they did is they made it so Parler could not update its app unless they pledged
[3:23:25.040 --> 3:23:30.400]  to delete hate speech, which of course is everything that Tim Cook doesn't like, just
[3:23:30.400 --> 3:23:32.040]  like he doesn't like Alex Jones.
[3:23:32.040 --> 3:23:35.540]  So Alex Jones has to go, he doesn't like David Knight.
[3:23:35.540 --> 3:23:39.040]  So David Knight has to go, doesn't like Owen Schreuer.
[3:23:39.040 --> 3:23:41.560]  So Owen Schreuer has to go.
[3:23:41.560 --> 3:23:46.520]  And eventually after a total media backlash, Fox News covered this, big league politics
[3:23:46.520 --> 3:23:47.520]  covered this.
[3:23:47.520 --> 3:23:52.680]  I'm sure the Info Wars crew and staff covered this, finally Apple back down.
[3:23:52.680 --> 3:23:57.360]  But for now, and just think by the way of the security threat that this could have posed.
[3:23:57.360 --> 3:24:01.920]  Say Parler discovered a bug in its app, though they weren't allowed to update the app.
[3:24:01.920 --> 3:24:05.720]  They weren't allowed to give updates to the people who downloaded it.
[3:24:05.720 --> 3:24:12.520]  So Apple was essentially creating a massive security situation because again, Parler refused
[3:24:12.520 --> 3:24:15.000]  to abide by Tim Apple's rules.
[3:24:15.000 --> 3:24:19.200]  I think we should just call him that, Tim Apple, Tim Apple's rules and censor whoever
[3:24:19.200 --> 3:24:21.000]  he doesn't like.
[3:24:21.000 --> 3:24:26.480]  And also this or last month, just in early June, Facebook banned the popular dysfunctional
[3:24:26.480 --> 3:24:33.160]  veterans page that the whole point of this page was to raise money for a 5013C, a not
[3:24:33.160 --> 3:24:41.760]  for profit that get this provided housing and rehabilitation for homeless disabled veterans.
[3:24:41.760 --> 3:24:45.520]  That is where Facebook is at and you can go into the weeds and they say, well, they did
[3:24:45.520 --> 3:24:49.000]  this wrong and they did this wrong and they say, well, Facebook gave us permission and
[3:24:49.000 --> 3:24:53.520]  we were following the letter of its rules and the law, but it doesn't matter.
[3:24:53.520 --> 3:24:54.880]  They're gone.
[3:24:54.880 --> 3:24:59.640]  And these poor homeless veterans, I guess they're back on the streets and then actually
[3:24:59.640 --> 3:25:04.360]  just as Alex was in the last segment discussing tech censorship, I was checking my Facebook
[3:25:04.360 --> 3:25:06.880]  notifications for God Emperor Trump.
[3:25:06.880 --> 3:25:12.800]  And I got another notification saying that I posted fake news, more specifically a member
[3:25:12.800 --> 3:25:17.320]  of a very large Facebook group that I run posted fake news.
[3:25:17.320 --> 3:25:21.200]  And what Facebook loves to do is play games.
[3:25:21.200 --> 3:25:23.000]  They go to people like Snopes.
[3:25:23.000 --> 3:25:25.600]  They go to people like AFP.
[3:25:25.600 --> 3:25:30.960]  They go to these extremely biased outlets who twist words and manipulate.
[3:25:30.960 --> 3:25:34.560]  And so therefore anything we post is fake.
[3:25:34.560 --> 3:25:39.400]  And what's more absurd, this is a group with 22,000 members and one will post something
[3:25:39.400 --> 3:25:44.400]  bad and Facebook will literally say, we're going to shadow ban your entire group.
[3:25:44.400 --> 3:25:46.080]  Nobody will be able to find it.
[3:25:46.080 --> 3:25:47.620]  Nobody will see the posts anymore.
[3:25:47.620 --> 3:25:52.720]  It will be totally and completely inaccessible, but you'll still be on Facebook, so we're
[3:25:52.720 --> 3:25:53.720]  not censoring you.
[3:25:53.720 --> 3:25:58.920]  And this is your fault, by the way, this is just a snapshot of the type of insanity that
[3:25:58.920 --> 3:26:03.880]  those of us who are for better or worse still allowed on social media have to deal with on
[3:26:03.880 --> 3:26:05.640]  a day to day basis.
[3:26:05.640 --> 3:26:12.560]  President Trump being censored, a cartel like faction forming to push out the new up and
[3:26:12.560 --> 3:26:14.240]  coming competitors.
[3:26:14.240 --> 3:26:18.720]  You've seen Gab being totally de-platformed, they're now in the blockchain, so that cannot
[3:26:18.720 --> 3:26:19.720]  happen again.
[3:26:19.720 --> 3:26:24.080]  You've seen Parler, they're threatening to take the app out of the app store, Minds app
[3:26:24.080 --> 3:26:32.400]  out of the app store because this cartel like faction, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook,
[3:26:32.400 --> 3:26:36.160]  Twitter, all of them seem to just work together in tandem.
[3:26:36.160 --> 3:26:40.880]  It's truly a bizarre spectacle to behold, especially considering we live in a country
[3:26:40.880 --> 3:26:46.720]  that has a rich history of fighting back with antitrust legislation and breaking up everybody
[3:26:46.720 --> 3:26:50.040]  from the oil companies to AT&T.
[3:26:50.040 --> 3:26:55.960]  And that's why it is so important that if you get value out of this broadcast or any broadcast,
[3:26:55.960 --> 3:27:02.400]  any real news that is coming at you on a daily basis, Info Wars is a multi-million dollar
[3:27:02.400 --> 3:27:03.400]  institution.
[3:27:03.400 --> 3:27:04.400]  They need your support.
[3:27:04.400 --> 3:27:09.960]  And you can see here, I've got a wide array of beautiful, delicious supplements.
[3:27:09.960 --> 3:27:12.360]  I've got the toothpaste here.
[3:27:12.360 --> 3:27:17.800]  I am a big, big supporter of the Info War, and a lot of this was actually sent to me
[3:27:17.800 --> 3:27:24.200]  by fans of my broadcast who thought, I want to make sure this guy has a wonderful life.
[3:27:24.200 --> 3:27:30.120]  And so I've got Extender Weiss, I've got the DNA Force, I've got Brain Force, I've got
[3:27:30.120 --> 3:27:35.840]  X2, I've got bodies, I've got Alpha Male, I've got Super Male Vitality and the delicious
[3:27:35.840 --> 3:27:36.840]  toothpaste.
[3:27:36.840 --> 3:27:38.080]  Honestly, it's a great toothpaste.
[3:27:38.080 --> 3:27:40.000]  I don't know how Alex makes money off it.
[3:27:40.000 --> 3:27:42.520]  You use barely any of it, and it lasts forever.
[3:27:42.520 --> 3:27:48.360]  And then you can see behind me, I've got more, I've got the bone broth and the gut fusion.
[3:27:48.360 --> 3:27:49.800]  It is all extremely high quality.
[3:27:49.800 --> 3:27:55.560]  I don't know where on earth you will find anything else like it, especially at these
[3:27:55.560 --> 3:27:57.360]  prices.
[3:27:57.360 --> 3:28:02.840]  So I implore you, go to infowarstore.com and support the Info War, and I'll just tell a
[3:28:02.840 --> 3:28:03.840]  quick story.
[3:28:03.840 --> 3:28:05.680]  We've got maybe 50 seconds left here.
[3:28:05.680 --> 3:28:10.640]  DNA Force, I had a broken wrist in the fourth grade when I was just a little kid.
[3:28:10.640 --> 3:28:14.680]  It got more damaged because I'm going to, you know, maybe the public school system didn't
[3:28:14.680 --> 3:28:18.080]  do me any favor letting me play basketball with a broken wrist.
[3:28:18.080 --> 3:28:23.120]  And I have had nerve damage and terrible wrist pain, basically my entire life.
[3:28:23.120 --> 3:28:27.680]  I've been on DNA Force about a month now, and there's been no throbbing, there's been
[3:28:27.680 --> 3:28:33.440]  no inflammation, there's been some weird tingles that have been frankly fascinating.
[3:28:33.440 --> 3:28:38.640]  But the only thing I can attribute this to is DNA Force, and so I highly recommend it.
[3:28:38.640 --> 3:28:43.320]  It is possibly my new favorite item on infowarstore.com.
[3:28:43.320 --> 3:28:47.240]  And I think if you have these problems, hey, it's worth a shot, it's better than surgery.
[3:28:47.240 --> 3:28:51.040]  I'm Tom Pappert, this is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show.
[3:28:51.040 --> 3:28:53.680]  We'll be back after this break with more.
[3:28:53.680 --> 3:28:58.200]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol
[3:28:58.200 --> 3:29:02.480]  levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[3:29:02.480 --> 3:29:07.240]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes, and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat
[3:29:07.240 --> 3:29:10.880]  are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[3:29:10.880 --> 3:29:15.400]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[3:29:15.400 --> 3:29:16.600]  across America.
[3:29:16.600 --> 3:29:20.920]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[3:29:20.920 --> 3:29:24.000]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much
[3:29:24.000 --> 3:29:25.000]  healthier I feel.
[3:29:25.000 --> 3:29:27.600]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[3:29:27.600 --> 3:29:32.920]  Over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to
[3:29:32.920 --> 3:29:35.280]  keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[3:30:28.920 --> 3:30:33.800]  financial support, because I'm committed to fight to the end, but I want to win, and without
[3:30:33.800 --> 3:30:38.160]  you I'm going to be destroyed, and it's not going to be fun, but that's not what's important.
[3:30:38.160 --> 3:30:39.480]  The enemy could win.
[3:30:39.480 --> 3:30:41.600]  We're a key chess piece in this fight.
[3:30:41.600 --> 3:30:45.760]  You're being used by God, you're being used by God, this is Providence, so I salute you
[3:30:45.760 --> 3:30:49.400]  and I thank you for all you've done from the bottom of my heart.

[3:31:54.560 --> 3:31:58.480]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena and the public square.
[3:31:58.480 --> 3:32:02.840]  The other thing that's unique about InfoWars is it isn't the only network of this reach
[3:32:02.840 --> 3:32:06.680]  that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy, that's not backed
[3:32:06.680 --> 3:32:10.920]  by some billionaire, that's not being funded by a secret foreign government, it is completely
[3:32:10.920 --> 3:32:12.040]  independent of all that.
[3:32:12.040 --> 3:32:17.760]  It is an old-school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press
[3:32:17.760 --> 3:32:21.600]  and freedom of speech, that in fact the founders were so concerned with, at the beginning of
[3:32:21.600 --> 3:32:25.920]  the country, they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this
[3:32:25.920 --> 3:32:29.520]  because this was the kind of press they wanted, and that ultimately we now live in an era
[3:32:29.520 --> 3:32:33.360]  where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies
[3:32:33.360 --> 3:32:37.480]  who've been able to control and manipulate what news and views a person is allowed to
[3:32:37.480 --> 3:32:42.080]  have or express or hear, and the InfoWars audience has broken through that.
[3:32:42.080 --> 3:32:46.440]  They are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate American democracy and
[3:32:46.440 --> 3:32:51.120]  freedom, and that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the platforming, defamation,
[3:32:51.120 --> 3:33:04.320]  lawfare, and libel targeting youth.
[3:33:04.320 --> 3:33:20.880]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show, I am Tom Papert, Facebook's got-imper-trump reporter
[3:33:20.880 --> 3:33:25.560]  for Big League Politics, filling in for Alex for the rest of this third hour.
[3:33:25.560 --> 3:33:31.200]  If you haven't been watching CNN or MSNPC these last few days, you are well aware that
[3:33:31.200 --> 3:33:37.760]  we had last weekend some of the worst ANTIFA attacks in history.
[3:33:37.760 --> 3:33:46.480]  It's been termed on Twitter by many the ANTIFA Riot in Portland, Oregon, and as a result
[3:33:46.480 --> 3:33:52.480]  we now have a petition, it's been started by some individuals on the official White
[3:33:52.480 --> 3:33:59.920]  House petition website to name ANTIFA a domestic terrorist organization, and in its first 24
[3:33:59.920 --> 3:34:07.480]  hours online, it's already gained one-fifth, almost one-quarter of the signatures it will
[3:34:07.480 --> 3:34:12.240]  require to be put on the president's desk.
[3:34:12.240 --> 3:34:16.400]  Petition to name ANTIFA a domestic terrorist organization gains 20,000 signatures in 24
[3:34:16.400 --> 3:34:22.760]  hours, you can see now it's just under or just over 25,000 signatures, a quarter of
[3:34:22.760 --> 3:34:28.560]  the way there, and this is vitally important at this point in time.
[3:34:28.560 --> 3:34:34.040]  These people are roaming the streets, attacking elderly men, they're threatening events with
[3:34:34.040 --> 3:34:39.640]  acid, they're throwing milkshakes that are really quick cement, so you will get acid
[3:34:39.640 --> 3:34:45.280]  burns from the cement, and they're totally doing this with impunity.
[3:34:45.280 --> 3:34:51.480]  And part of the reason is they go to leftist cess pits like Portland, Oregon.
[3:34:51.480 --> 3:34:57.080]  So the petition reads, as President Trump's first term comes to a close, ANTIFA organizations
[3:34:57.080 --> 3:35:01.400]  all around the nation have gotten even more violent and depraved.
[3:35:01.400 --> 3:35:06.640]  They've burnt down universities, attacked the elderly, and even threatened acid attacks.
[3:35:06.640 --> 3:35:10.640]  ANTIFA continues to target their fellow citizens with acts of violence and intimidation in
[3:35:10.640 --> 3:35:13.440]  order to reach a desired political outcome.
[3:35:13.440 --> 3:35:18.240]  Recently, members of ANTIFA brutally assaulted an independent journalist, that would be Andy
[3:35:18.240 --> 3:35:23.240]  No, who remains hospitalized with a brain bleed after being viciously beaten and doused
[3:35:23.240 --> 3:35:27.680]  in liquid concrete, and Andy is freshly out of the hospital.
[3:35:27.680 --> 3:35:32.160]  It's almost a miraculous recovery, I'm sure there's lots of patriots who have been praying
[3:35:32.160 --> 3:35:33.720]  for his recovery.
[3:35:33.720 --> 3:35:38.120]  So the petition continues to demand the White House and President Trump take direct action
[3:35:38.120 --> 3:35:43.240]  in labeling ANTIFA as a domestic terrorist group full stop.
[3:35:43.240 --> 3:35:47.920]  Our nation's security and homeland are at risk until we are able to clearly define ANTIFA
[3:35:47.920 --> 3:35:53.000]  as domestic terrorists in this madness.
[3:35:53.000 --> 3:35:57.240]  The person who created the petition doubled down on this, saying all he's trying to do
[3:35:57.240 --> 3:35:58.440]  is have a peaceful event.
[3:35:58.440 --> 3:36:05.560]  It's actually the co-organizer of the Demand Free Speech Rally in Washington, D.C. in Riketario.
[3:36:05.560 --> 3:36:11.120]  And he says he's just trying to exercise his First Amendment and celebrate Americana and
[3:36:11.120 --> 3:36:13.280]  what made this country great.
[3:36:13.280 --> 3:36:21.040]  And as a result, a new threat, ANTIFA plans acid attack on D.C. Free Speech Rally promises
[3:36:21.040 --> 3:36:23.480]  to blind attendees.
[3:36:23.480 --> 3:36:26.920]  And this is a fascinating story, I know Alex has reported on it and the entire Infowars
[3:36:26.920 --> 3:36:33.960]  crew has, it's gone viral across the internet, I was happy to break it at bigleaguepolitics.com.
[3:36:33.960 --> 3:36:38.480]  And what's fascinating is when you break a story like this, the blowback that comes back
[3:36:38.480 --> 3:36:41.360]  on me, just the humble reporter.
[3:36:41.360 --> 3:36:47.360]  So while doing this, I was researching the person who made the threats on Telegram, it
[3:36:47.360 --> 3:36:51.520]  was a guy who used the handle, pound on your boy.
[3:36:51.520 --> 3:36:55.120]  I think he may be talking about proud boys and physical violence.
[3:36:55.120 --> 3:36:58.800]  I don't know for sure, it just seems like maybe that's what he's getting at.
[3:36:58.800 --> 3:37:05.600]  And the cartoon he used in the article we've got it put up there, it's a man with three
[3:37:05.600 --> 3:37:12.040]  arrows, that's ANTIFA artwork, beating a person with a wispy mustache, I guess that's supposed
[3:37:12.040 --> 3:37:14.200]  to be a proud boy.
[3:37:14.200 --> 3:37:18.720]  And you search around, and the person who drew this, and I'm certainly not saying he
[3:37:18.720 --> 3:37:21.320]  did it, I don't think he did.
[3:37:21.320 --> 3:37:25.640]  But I think that he is definitely egging these guys on, so to speak.
[3:37:25.640 --> 3:37:30.800]  They say that's what Infowars does, they say Infowars is inspiring people toward violence,
[3:37:30.800 --> 3:37:35.600]  but I've yet to see Alex or anyone at Infowars put out something where people are being shot
[3:37:35.600 --> 3:37:40.600]  in the belly and beat in the face with the caption, pound on your boy.
[3:37:40.600 --> 3:37:42.800]  I don't think Alex sells any merch like that.
[3:37:42.800 --> 3:37:47.400]  I don't think that he sells beat up ANTIFA merch, and I think that if he did, it might
[3:37:47.400 --> 3:37:50.840]  be morally reprehensible, I don't think he would.
[3:37:50.840 --> 3:37:58.440]  But this artist turns out to be a Rolling Stone writer who also writes for Playboy,
[3:37:58.440 --> 3:38:04.320]  he calls himself an educator, I'm not sure who or what he educates, and I reach out to
[3:38:04.320 --> 3:38:07.240]  him and ask for a comment.
[3:38:07.240 --> 3:38:08.640]  He doesn't reply.
[3:38:08.640 --> 3:38:14.400]  18 hours later, we finally published the article, we're not going to hold an article indefinitely
[3:38:14.400 --> 3:38:18.720]  because we don't get a response, that's not how news works.
[3:38:18.720 --> 3:38:27.720]  So he then throws a bit of a fit on Twitter.com, as these leftists are often want to do.
[3:38:27.720 --> 3:38:32.640]  And he tries to get other ANTIFA groups to go after yours truly.
[3:38:32.640 --> 3:38:38.600]  He tags New York City ANTIFA, the It's Going Down publication, where they, I'm not going
[3:38:38.600 --> 3:38:42.880]  to say they dox people, but they certainly do seem to come close to doxing people and
[3:38:42.880 --> 3:38:49.200]  they tell them to go after me, because what I did was dangerous.
[3:38:49.200 --> 3:38:53.600]  And so that's the blowback you get when you talk about acid attacks, the guy saying, we
[3:38:53.600 --> 3:39:01.120]  already have the muriatic acid wax and balloons, I just want to blind as many of you expletives
[3:39:01.120 --> 3:39:03.560]  as I can.
[3:39:03.560 --> 3:39:07.800]  That's the type of people we're dealing with, and if you expose this and you draw the line
[3:39:07.800 --> 3:39:13.600]  and say, hey, he's using artwork created by a mainstream major journalist who writes favorably
[3:39:13.600 --> 3:39:20.640]  about ANTIFA and publishes propaganda and artwork where people are being murdered and
[3:39:20.640 --> 3:39:24.520]  beaten and calls it satire and it stays on these platforms because it's okay because
[3:39:24.520 --> 3:39:25.520]  it's satire.
[3:39:25.520 --> 3:39:27.480]  I didn't know that's the way it worked.
[3:39:27.480 --> 3:39:30.720]  We could say anything we want, apparently, all you have to do is say it's satire.
[3:39:30.720 --> 3:39:35.480]  I don't think any conservative is brave enough to test that theory, but that it works for
[3:39:35.480 --> 3:39:37.080]  the left.
[3:39:37.080 --> 3:39:38.080]  It works for the left.
[3:39:38.080 --> 3:39:43.400]  And if you have the audacity to go after them to expose them for what they're doing, then
[3:39:43.400 --> 3:39:47.120]  you go into the crosshairs.
[3:39:47.120 --> 3:39:53.640]  Turning back to Portland, it's interesting how the media and the local government is
[3:39:53.640 --> 3:39:57.080]  completely more or less on the side of ANTIFA.
[3:39:57.080 --> 3:40:03.440]  You've got the Portland mayor, Ted Wheeler, who is shielding ANTIFA from blame for their
[3:40:03.440 --> 3:40:10.120]  terroristic actions following the attacks, who refused to mention them by name.
[3:40:10.120 --> 3:40:13.400]  And there's all kinds of dirt on this guy that I've heard that I'm not privileged to
[3:40:13.400 --> 3:40:15.080]  repeat on the air just yet.
[3:40:15.080 --> 3:40:20.120]  I think it's all going to come public, but Ted Cruz is calling for an investigation into
[3:40:20.120 --> 3:40:27.400]  mayor Wheeler, who will not name ANTIFA, and then it gets crazier because the Portland
[3:40:27.400 --> 3:40:30.960]  police, they're just out there doing their best.
[3:40:30.960 --> 3:40:32.400]  They get orders from the top.
[3:40:32.400 --> 3:40:36.840]  They get orders from Wheeler, and their other bosses do not arrest anybody, do not break
[3:40:36.840 --> 3:40:38.360]  up fights.
[3:40:38.360 --> 3:40:41.840]  Let Andy know the gay conservative journalist.
[3:40:41.840 --> 3:40:45.600]  Let him be beaten bloody to the point where he has a brain hemorrhage.
[3:40:45.600 --> 3:40:48.720]  Let the one guy who tries to go in and protect Andy.
[3:40:48.720 --> 3:40:55.240]  Let him get his skull cracked open so his brain can seep out and thank God both of these
[3:40:55.240 --> 3:40:56.240]  people have recovered.
[3:40:56.240 --> 3:40:59.880]  They truly have somebody above looking out for them.
[3:40:59.880 --> 3:41:06.400]  But then the Portland police association actually levied blame against both ANTIFA and the
[3:41:06.400 --> 3:41:07.720]  Proud Boys.
[3:41:07.720 --> 3:41:15.480]  So not only is the mayor siding with ANTIFA, you have the police association, the police
[3:41:15.480 --> 3:41:21.480]  union, essentially siding with ANTIFA as well, and you can tell they tried their hardest
[3:41:21.480 --> 3:41:27.040]  to seem non-biased, like maybe ANTIFA is kind of to blame here, maybe we should levy a little
[3:41:27.040 --> 3:41:28.040]  extra blame on them.
[3:41:28.040 --> 3:41:31.400]  But then they write, and the Proud Boys.
[3:41:31.400 --> 3:41:35.280]  We need the mayor to tell the Proud Boys that they're not welcome here.
[3:41:35.280 --> 3:41:40.640]  Let's get the exact quote, this is according to the association's Facebook page.
[3:41:40.640 --> 3:41:45.240]  It's time for our mayor to do two things, tell both ANTIFA and Proud Boys that our city
[3:41:45.240 --> 3:41:52.480]  will not accept violence and remove the handcuffs from officers and let them stop the violence
[3:41:52.480 --> 3:41:57.560]  through strong and swift enforcement action.
[3:41:57.560 --> 3:42:00.640]  So you can see they're blaming the Proud Boys for this.
[3:42:00.640 --> 3:42:06.000]  Well in this article you just saw the video on screen while Mr. No was attacked.
[3:42:06.000 --> 3:42:10.840]  The Proud Boys were a 32 minute walk away, I got a tip about this, and I do a little
[3:42:10.840 --> 3:42:13.280]  basic research, this is in brain surgery.
[3:42:13.280 --> 3:42:18.920]  I go on Google Maps and I see this bridge that they're crossing in that video is a 32
[3:42:18.920 --> 3:42:23.240]  minute walk away from where Mr. No was attacked.
[3:42:23.240 --> 3:42:29.040]  And yet you've got the mayor refusing to name ANTIFA, you've got the police association
[3:42:29.040 --> 3:42:33.400]  saying well, both parties are responsible, both parties are responsible.
[3:42:33.400 --> 3:42:38.360]  So what we're seeing here is some kind of cabal where they are desperately trying to
[3:42:38.360 --> 3:42:43.320]  avoid blaming the people responsible for this violence and blame conservatives for it.
[3:42:43.320 --> 3:42:50.640]  And when we come back you'll see what conservatives are doing to respond, it is absolutely devastating
[3:42:50.640 --> 3:42:51.640]  to their narrative.
[3:42:51.640 --> 3:42:53.760]  We'll be right back, this is the Alex Jones show.
[3:42:53.760 --> 3:42:57.840]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[3:42:57.840 --> 3:43:02.480]  So the Infowars model is a self-fulfilling, self-supporting structure that is promoting
[3:43:02.480 --> 3:43:07.360]  free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining
[3:43:07.360 --> 3:43:08.360]  one another.
[3:43:08.360 --> 3:43:12.800]  It is the only independent press of this size and scale, of this public reach.
[3:43:12.800 --> 3:43:17.840]  It is the one model that says here's a way to have a self-supporting, self-sustaining,
[3:43:17.840 --> 3:43:22.040]  self-structured, little de-democratic structure that because the audience determines what
[3:43:22.040 --> 3:43:26.400]  content goes up, the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices
[3:43:26.400 --> 3:43:27.400]  and supporting Infowars.
[3:43:27.400 --> 3:43:32.040]  And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50
[3:43:32.040 --> 3:43:35.920]  a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate
[3:43:35.920 --> 3:43:41.120]  driven model and the ability to do that and at the same time support press, support speech,
[3:43:41.120 --> 3:43:44.920]  support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want
[3:43:44.920 --> 3:43:45.920]  to hold.
[3:43:45.920 --> 3:43:50.080]  And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment and it is the celebration
[3:43:50.080 --> 3:43:52.400]  of free press and free speech with free markets.
[3:43:52.400 --> 3:43:56.240]  We'll be very, very clear with everybody about all of this.
[3:43:56.240 --> 3:44:00.200]  We're going into the season of war and they have been inches from shutting down the final
[3:44:00.200 --> 3:44:04.760]  mega counts we have through their criminal activity and their digital fraud and we need
[3:44:04.760 --> 3:44:07.760]  to know that we've got capital to go six months a year.
[3:44:07.760 --> 3:44:08.760]  We need to end here.
[3:44:08.760 --> 3:44:12.840]  We need to be provisioned and you've got my total commitment that I am going to rampage
[3:44:12.840 --> 3:44:14.440]  forward against the enemy fearlessly.
[3:44:14.440 --> 3:44:18.280]  I'm loving every minute of this because I know I'm getting under their skin.
[3:44:18.280 --> 3:44:20.120]  I'm bloody and then I'm up politically.
[3:44:20.120 --> 3:44:24.160]  I'm banging heads with them and they can't help but attack back with lies and that just
[3:44:24.160 --> 3:44:25.160]  brings more people here.
[3:44:25.160 --> 3:44:28.480]  So I'm in one hell of a fight and so are you and I need war bonds.
[3:44:28.480 --> 3:44:29.480]  I need gas.
[3:44:29.480 --> 3:44:31.440]  I need ammo politically now.
[3:44:31.440 --> 3:44:35.320]  Literally, if you flood us with money and if you flood us with product purchases and if
[3:44:35.320 --> 3:44:37.720]  you flood us with your word of mouth, you're unstoppable.
[3:44:37.720 --> 3:44:38.720]  We're unstoppable together.
[3:44:38.720 --> 3:44:40.120]  I want to send a strong message to the enemy.
[3:44:40.120 --> 3:44:43.800]  I want to raise a couple million dollars right now to let the enemy know that their attacks
[3:44:43.800 --> 3:44:48.240]  are failing and that you will stand with us and I will never back down to have my commitment.
[3:44:48.240 --> 3:44:52.000]  This only gives me more energy and more understanding of what we're facing and that we were right
[3:44:52.000 --> 3:44:54.920]  about this.
[3:44:54.920 --> 3:44:56.880]  Briefly folks, please do not forget.
[3:44:56.880 --> 3:44:58.040]  This is the maximum alert.
[3:44:58.040 --> 3:44:59.040]  We wouldn't be here without you.

[3:45:10.560 --> 3:45:12.360]  We will put it into the fight against these globalists.
[3:45:12.360 --> 3:45:17.320]  We need money to fight back and to let them know we're taking action and to defend ourselves.

[3:45:49.360 --> 3:45:50.360]  Thank you for your support.
[3:45:50.360 --> 3:45:53.040]  We're getting a lot of support right now, but we need a lot to go into this dark night.
[3:45:53.040 --> 3:45:55.480]  We're not going to back down.
[3:45:55.480 --> 3:45:59.200]  I talk about this on the air and I know it sinks into people, but I've decided
[3:45:59.200 --> 3:46:02.560]  that we're going to kind of reboot all our supplements and that if you go back 5, 6 years
[3:46:02.560 --> 3:46:06.240]  ago before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits and the rest of it, I would
[3:46:06.240 --> 3:46:09.680]  talk about how great the products are and how they were the best and why they were and
[3:46:09.680 --> 3:46:12.200]  I'd have doctors on an expert to explain why they were so good.
[3:46:12.200 --> 3:46:15.560]  And instead the last few years, I'm like, hey, we need to really support us or they'll
[3:46:15.560 --> 3:46:16.560]  shut us down.
[3:46:16.560 --> 3:46:18.960]  The biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how
[3:46:18.960 --> 3:46:19.960]  wonderful they were.
[3:46:19.960 --> 3:46:21.800]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[3:46:21.800 --> 3:46:26.040]  Jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements.
[3:46:26.040 --> 3:46:31.280]  You know, under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been through
[3:46:31.280 --> 3:46:34.000]  the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[3:46:34.000 --> 3:46:37.880]  But then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them and all drugs are is the
[3:46:37.880 --> 3:46:41.480]  system trying to tweak what's in Mother Nature and manipulate it and do different things.
[3:46:41.480 --> 3:46:42.760]  And a lot of drugs work great.
[3:46:42.760 --> 3:46:46.720]  They have side effects, not with Mother Nature, but Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing about
[3:46:46.720 --> 3:46:48.320]  God's medicine chest.
[3:46:48.320 --> 3:47:17.560]  Welcome back to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show.
[3:47:17.560 --> 3:47:24.440]  I am Tom Pappert filling in for Alex, Facebook's got him for a Trump reporter on bigleakpolitics.com.
[3:47:24.440 --> 3:47:32.440]  We were talking about the threats, the attacks, the acid, the quick cement, and the best part
[3:47:32.440 --> 3:47:37.520]  about people in this audience about the Trump movement as a whole, this giant populist push
[3:47:37.520 --> 3:47:42.640]  that is really larger than Trump, larger than the United States, it's all across the globe.
[3:47:42.640 --> 3:47:47.200]  People from every corner of the earth are rising up against the globalists.
[3:47:47.200 --> 3:47:52.440]  And here in the United States in Portland, they're not going to lay down and take this.
[3:47:52.440 --> 3:48:00.560]  Conservatives are planning a massive end domestic terrorism rally against the Portland Antifa.
[3:48:00.560 --> 3:48:04.840]  This is organized in conjunction with the Proud Boys and several major conservative
[3:48:04.840 --> 3:48:07.960]  individuals, prominent, prominent people.
[3:48:07.960 --> 3:48:12.680]  And the idea behind this is to test what we were talking about in the last segment.
[3:48:12.680 --> 3:48:19.160]  The Portland Police Association says they want to let their officers do their job.
[3:48:19.160 --> 3:48:20.960]  And I'm very much in favor of that personally.
[3:48:20.960 --> 3:48:24.320]  I would love to see police officers be allowed to do their job.
[3:48:24.320 --> 3:48:29.680]  The Portland mayor says it is time to understand that violence is not welcome in Portland, Oregon.
[3:48:29.680 --> 3:48:31.120]  Well, I would love to test this theory.
[3:48:31.120 --> 3:48:35.080]  And I think that is the idea behind the people who are putting this on.
[3:48:35.080 --> 3:48:44.440]  I wrote this at bigleapolitics.com, the end domestic terrorism rally slated for August 17th.
[3:48:44.440 --> 3:48:48.360]  This is a quote from Enrique Tario, who is actually organizing this in conjunction with
[3:48:48.360 --> 3:48:49.360]  several other people.
[3:48:49.360 --> 3:48:55.320]  We're planning this massive rally with the calm, peaceful intention to push back against
[3:48:55.320 --> 3:48:57.560]  the violence from Antifa.
[3:48:57.560 --> 3:49:01.800]  The Portland mayor and police need to understand that conservatives are peaceful people who
[3:49:01.800 --> 3:49:04.560]  just want our first amendment protected.
[3:49:04.560 --> 3:49:08.200]  He went on, it's good that the Portland police want to do their job.
[3:49:08.200 --> 3:49:12.560]  So long as they do their job, the Proud Boys will have a peaceful rally and there will
[3:49:12.560 --> 3:49:16.640]  be multiple Antifa arrests.
[3:49:16.640 --> 3:49:20.600]  And I tend to think he may be on to something here, because if you look at the violence
[3:49:20.600 --> 3:49:26.000]  that happened in Portland last weekend, there were two or three separate conservative events.
[3:49:26.000 --> 3:49:30.160]  One was a Proud Boys event, one was a completely unrelated event, then there was a third event.
[3:49:30.160 --> 3:49:35.680]  All of those, not a single arrest, totally peaceful, wonderful events.
[3:49:35.680 --> 3:49:36.680]  Everybody had fun.
[3:49:36.680 --> 3:49:37.680]  They went out in the sun.
[3:49:37.680 --> 3:49:40.680]  You saw some of the video from the last segment where they're just walking around carrying
[3:49:40.680 --> 3:49:43.360]  American flags, walking across the bridge.
[3:49:43.360 --> 3:49:46.320]  That's what conservatives do when they exercise their first amendment.
[3:49:46.320 --> 3:49:49.520]  But the left still managed to get in trouble.
[3:49:49.520 --> 3:49:52.440]  They attacked poor Andy.
[3:49:52.440 --> 3:49:55.640]  No, they attacked the individual who tried to protect Andy.
[3:49:55.640 --> 3:50:04.080]  You know, with a metal pipe, crowbar is what some are saying, left his skull wide open.
[3:50:04.080 --> 3:50:06.960]  Multiple people were arrested, multiple people were injured.
[3:50:06.960 --> 3:50:12.320]  They add cement in the milkshakes, which I've been saying long before any of this happened
[3:50:12.320 --> 3:50:14.320]  that this isn't a milkshake.
[3:50:14.320 --> 3:50:19.040]  You could put a milkshake in the freezer for 24 hours and you're basically talking about
[3:50:19.040 --> 3:50:20.040]  a brick.
[3:50:20.040 --> 3:50:22.960]  I didn't know that they were just going to transition to actual bricks.
[3:50:22.960 --> 3:50:25.520]  I could not have seen that coming.
[3:50:25.520 --> 3:50:30.040]  So the Enrique also said that, you know, they start with milkshakes before you know it.
[3:50:30.040 --> 3:50:32.320]  It's cement.
[3:50:32.320 --> 3:50:37.240]  And then the next step is muriatic acid to burn people alive.
[3:50:37.240 --> 3:50:42.520]  They want to blind us and actually give a heart attack.
[3:50:42.520 --> 3:50:46.280]  And so I tend to think he's onto something here because you look at these events and
[3:50:46.280 --> 3:50:50.280]  you've never seen a conservative throw the first punch.
[3:50:50.280 --> 3:50:52.160]  You've never seen a proud boy throw the first punch.
[3:50:52.160 --> 3:50:57.120]  Now, sometimes interesting things happen, they get attacked and they retaliate.
[3:50:57.120 --> 3:50:58.120]  What are we supposed to do?
[3:50:58.120 --> 3:50:59.680]  Sit there and get our brains bashed in?
[3:50:59.680 --> 3:51:00.680]  I don't know.
[3:51:00.680 --> 3:51:04.040]  Unfortunately, I live in a peaceful neck of the woods here in Wichita, Kansas.
[3:51:04.040 --> 3:51:06.200]  So I don't have to deal with these except for when I travel.
[3:51:06.200 --> 3:51:08.360]  But let me tell you, folks, I may not be much.
[3:51:08.360 --> 3:51:12.480]  I may not be Alex Jones, but I'm going to go down fighting if I am attacked defensive
[3:51:12.480 --> 3:51:14.200]  only would never advocate violence.
[3:51:14.200 --> 3:51:18.440]  In fact, I have poor violence, but I'm not going to get killed.
[3:51:18.440 --> 3:51:20.400]  It's not in the plan.
[3:51:20.400 --> 3:51:25.400]  And so I think he's right because if the Portland police do their jobs, they will arrest the
[3:51:25.400 --> 3:51:27.600]  people who are instigating violence.
[3:51:27.600 --> 3:51:32.520]  And I am completely positive that Antifa, I shouldn't say completely positive.
[3:51:32.520 --> 3:51:38.400]  I have a hunch they will prove the points of this rally in domestic terrorism by acting
[3:51:38.400 --> 3:51:41.960]  extraordinarily violent during the event.
[3:51:41.960 --> 3:51:45.280]  And only time will tell that's coming up in August.
[3:51:45.280 --> 3:51:52.320]  And by the way, the link there in Antifa.com will send you directly to that massive petition.
[3:51:52.320 --> 3:51:56.240]  Now just a little bit of history and who Antifa is.
[3:51:56.240 --> 3:52:01.120]  This next video we're going to play is exclusive to big league politics, and I'm so glad we
[3:52:01.120 --> 3:52:03.440]  can play it here on the Infowars broadcast.
[3:52:03.440 --> 3:52:08.400]  But it's a couple of year old video that was just sent to big league politics by an anonymous
[3:52:08.400 --> 3:52:12.680]  tipster because of what was happening over the weekend.
[3:52:12.680 --> 3:52:16.600]  They recorded this and they didn't know what to do with it because it was so absurd.
[3:52:16.600 --> 3:52:23.800]  But Antifa was actually yelling, a law act bar, smash these Nazi scum during one of
[3:52:23.800 --> 3:52:27.640]  their major 2017 protests.
[3:52:27.640 --> 3:52:30.800]  So I know that I'm throwing the control room through a curveball.
[3:52:30.800 --> 3:52:34.040]  But can we go ahead and play that video as soon as you've got it ready?
[3:52:34.040 --> 3:52:36.520]  Because this is absolutely unsettling.
[3:52:36.520 --> 3:52:44.440]  And they just get a pass.
[3:52:44.440 --> 3:52:51.160]  They're screaming out of Angkor.
[3:52:51.160 --> 3:53:00.120]  They should probably cap it there because these people are totally insane and there
[3:53:00.120 --> 3:53:02.680]  is some inaudible stuff and I don't believe it was an expletive.
[3:53:02.680 --> 3:53:04.560]  But you just never know.
[3:53:04.560 --> 3:53:07.840]  You're not the nicest people in the world.
[3:53:07.840 --> 3:53:15.560]  A law act bar, of course, is the favored slogan to be yelled by radical Islamic terrorists
[3:53:15.560 --> 3:53:21.640]  before they go up and stab a priest, before they shoot up a concert, before they explode
[3:53:21.640 --> 3:53:23.160]  a nail bomb.
[3:53:23.160 --> 3:53:26.640]  Now, granted, it's not always that.
[3:53:26.640 --> 3:53:31.200]  Sometimes it's simply a call to prayer for Muslims.
[3:53:31.200 --> 3:53:33.560]  And is it not ironic that the people yelling it?
[3:53:33.560 --> 3:53:34.560]  Those are shrill voices.
[3:53:34.560 --> 3:53:35.560]  Were they not?
[3:53:35.560 --> 3:53:36.560]  I don't know.
[3:53:36.560 --> 3:53:37.560]  Maybe it's all the soy.
[3:53:37.560 --> 3:53:39.640]  It's the soy poisoning, making these men sound like this.
[3:53:39.640 --> 3:53:42.480]  But it sounded like a woman was leading that chant.
[3:53:42.480 --> 3:53:51.320]  Now, let me tell you, Antifa, if you want your cause justified, if you want to be anti-fascist,
[3:53:51.320 --> 3:53:53.560]  bring in radical Islam.
[3:53:53.560 --> 3:53:56.440]  And you'll get the rape culture you've always wanted.
[3:53:56.440 --> 3:54:00.280]  You'll get the authoritarian hellscape you've always wanted.
[3:54:00.280 --> 3:54:02.200]  That way you can really have a purpose.
[3:54:02.200 --> 3:54:07.680]  You can really have someone to fight because you've got women screaming a law act bar.
[3:54:07.680 --> 3:54:12.560]  If we go to the Middle East where women in Saudi Arabia were just allowed to drive a
[3:54:12.560 --> 3:54:15.960]  couple years ago, they're wearing these giant trash bags.
[3:54:15.960 --> 3:54:17.760]  I can't believe this isn't against their will.
[3:54:17.760 --> 3:54:22.320]  I can't believe these women who say it's a wonderful thing.
[3:54:22.320 --> 3:54:24.480]  That's what they want to bring here.
[3:54:24.480 --> 3:54:28.640]  That's who they are aligning themselves with and allying themselves with.
[3:54:28.640 --> 3:54:33.440]  And if you want this horrible rape culture, the authoritarianism, go ahead, keep bringing
[3:54:33.440 --> 3:54:34.680]  it here.
[3:54:34.680 --> 3:54:40.560]  Vote for the Cersei Lannister of Minnesota, Ilan Omar, who allegedly married her brother
[3:54:40.560 --> 3:54:45.400]  so she could skirt immigration law and get him into the country, allegedly filed taxes
[3:54:45.400 --> 3:54:49.320]  illegally with her brother after they were no longer married.
[3:54:49.320 --> 3:54:56.400]  Go ahead and vote for Rashida Tlaib, who called President Trump a mother expletive as she
[3:54:56.400 --> 3:54:59.880]  was elected and right after she was inaugurated.
[3:54:59.880 --> 3:55:05.560]  Go ahead, vote for the Hamas Caucus who described 9-11 as some people did something.
[3:55:05.560 --> 3:55:08.120]  Align yourselves with them, Antifa.
[3:55:08.120 --> 3:55:09.800]  See how it works out for you.
[3:55:09.800 --> 3:55:17.880]  I have a feeling they will not be nearly as peaceful as those of us on the real right.
[3:55:17.880 --> 3:55:23.160]  So in our last couple minutes here, I just want to double down on the importance of supporting
[3:55:23.160 --> 3:55:25.160]  this info war.
[3:55:25.160 --> 3:55:26.600]  Alex Jones needs the support.
[3:55:26.600 --> 3:55:27.600]  All of us need your support.
[3:55:27.600 --> 3:55:31.200]  Whoever you watch, if it's Owen Schreuer, if it's David Knight, if it's Alex Jones,
[3:55:31.200 --> 3:55:35.840]  if it's Harrison, this is the time to support us.
[3:55:35.840 --> 3:55:42.340]  I think we are on the verge of breaking through this war, and I use that term politically
[3:55:42.340 --> 3:55:46.320]  and figuratively, with big tech.
[3:55:46.320 --> 3:55:47.680]  They're panicking.
[3:55:47.680 --> 3:55:50.240]  They're like a cornered animal lashing out.
[3:55:50.240 --> 3:55:54.880]  We're going to censor Trump's tweets if we don't like what he has to say.
[3:55:54.880 --> 3:55:59.760]  We're going to kick our competitors off the app store if they don't adopt our hate speech
[3:55:59.760 --> 3:56:00.760]  policies.
[3:56:00.760 --> 3:56:02.400]  We'll do anything we can.
[3:56:02.400 --> 3:56:03.400]  We're kicking and screaming.
[3:56:03.400 --> 3:56:04.720]  I think they're desperate.
[3:56:04.720 --> 3:56:09.040]  I think the administration is completely on board with everything Alex Jones says in
[3:56:09.040 --> 3:56:10.720]  terms of what's happening.
[3:56:10.720 --> 3:56:15.200]  And so, again, I have this wonderful array of info wars products out in front of me,
[3:56:15.200 --> 3:56:18.760]  and I cannot say enough nice things about each and every one of them, and thank you
[3:56:18.760 --> 3:56:19.760]  to Randall.
[3:56:19.760 --> 3:56:24.480]  Again, it was a member of the info wars audience who sees me here and sees my nightly broadcast
[3:56:24.480 --> 3:56:29.240]  at 8pm central on the God Emperor Trump Facebook page who thought, you know, instead of just
[3:56:29.240 --> 3:56:34.400]  sending Tom money, or instead of just buying Tom's merch, I'm going to do a double whammy.
[3:56:34.400 --> 3:56:37.360]  I'm going to go buy info wars products and send it to them.
[3:56:37.360 --> 3:56:40.040]  And some of these products have been absolutely life changing.
[3:56:40.040 --> 3:56:45.920]  I told you about how DNA force has seemingly repaired a wrist that has been damaged since
[3:56:45.920 --> 3:56:47.440]  I was 10 years old.
[3:56:47.440 --> 3:56:48.800]  Of course, I'm not a doctor.
[3:56:48.800 --> 3:56:52.080]  I can't say for sure that's what happened, but I'm just connecting the dots.
[3:56:52.080 --> 3:56:53.080]  It's amazing.
[3:56:53.080 --> 3:56:54.520]  Everything is totally gone.
[3:56:54.520 --> 3:56:59.240]  I can't say enough things about alpha power and super male vitality, which have given
[3:56:59.240 --> 3:57:05.320]  me the vitality that I've needed to get back in the gym and lose about 100 pounds in just
[3:57:05.320 --> 3:57:06.520]  over a year.
[3:57:06.520 --> 3:57:08.640]  I can't say enough things about brain force.
[3:57:08.640 --> 3:57:15.600]  When you work from 7am until 9.30, 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock in night like I do, it is completely
[3:57:15.600 --> 3:57:19.560]  a life changer and a game changer to have that extra bit of energy.
[3:57:19.560 --> 3:57:24.840]  All of this, of course, is available at infowarsstore.com.
[3:57:24.840 --> 3:57:27.800]  Now is the time to support people more than ever.
[3:57:27.800 --> 3:57:32.840]  If you get value from this broadcast, please, please support the info war.
[3:57:32.840 --> 3:57:33.840]  I'm Tom Pappert.
[3:57:33.840 --> 3:57:35.440]  Facebook's got him for Trump.
[3:57:35.440 --> 3:57:40.520]  Owen Schreuer is coming up next on The War Room right here on Info Wars.
[3:57:40.520 --> 3:57:43.640]  Make sure to stay tuned.
[3:57:43.640 --> 3:57:45.720]  Robert Barnes, what has Big Tech become?
[3:57:45.720 --> 3:57:48.800]  Big Tech are big babies that have become big bullies, and the way they did so is because
[3:57:48.800 --> 3:57:53.240]  they face no consequence, social, economic, political, or legal for their illicit activities
[3:57:53.240 --> 3:57:54.240]  over two decades.
[3:57:54.240 --> 3:57:57.600]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the
[3:57:57.600 --> 3:58:00.920]  independent free press that care about this, the ordinary members of the public and the
[3:58:00.920 --> 3:58:05.200]  audience that care about this have to bring real social, political, economic consequence
[3:58:05.200 --> 3:58:06.200]  to their course of conduct.
[3:58:06.200 --> 3:58:10.040]  Otherwise, they will never change, and they will become the big tech oligarchs, the equivalent
[3:58:10.040 --> 3:58:14.000]  to the big trust of the 19th century, who ran American politics and ran American economy
[3:58:14.000 --> 3:58:17.400]  almost into the ground until we were able to recover after the Great Depression.
[3:58:17.400 --> 3:58:22.600]  The Info Wars audience is the fuel that flames the light of liberty across the world to make
[3:58:22.600 --> 3:58:27.320]  real the actions of independent free speech, to make real the original promise of an independent
[3:58:27.320 --> 3:58:28.320]  free press.
[3:58:28.320 --> 3:58:32.760]  Real collusion is Big Tech and big media manipulating and working with each other to try to meddle
[3:58:32.760 --> 3:58:34.760]  with elections, to try to shake people's thoughts.
[3:58:34.760 --> 3:58:37.720]  And then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening.
[3:58:37.720 --> 3:58:39.520]  It's the ultimate form of gaslighting.
[3:58:39.520 --> 3:58:41.480]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw.
[3:58:41.480 --> 3:58:43.000]  Even it is what we just saw.
[3:58:43.000 --> 3:58:45.720]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York.
[3:58:45.720 --> 3:58:46.720]  Marcus, you're on the air.
[3:58:46.720 --> 3:58:47.720]  You're rolling.
[3:58:47.720 --> 3:58:48.720]  Hey, Alex.
[3:58:48.720 --> 3:58:50.400]  Yeah, I just want to say, your show is a breath of fresh air.
[3:58:50.400 --> 3:58:54.040]  I talk to a lot of people here out in New York City, and one thing I can tell you is
[3:58:54.040 --> 3:58:56.520]  that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[3:58:56.520 --> 3:59:00.920]  I think that the neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know
[3:59:00.920 --> 3:59:05.240]  that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public, the approaching
[3:59:05.240 --> 3:59:06.240]  2020.
[3:59:06.240 --> 3:59:07.240]  That's it.
[3:59:07.240 --> 3:59:09.280]  I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[3:59:09.280 --> 3:59:12.080]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[3:59:12.080 --> 3:59:13.400]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[3:59:13.400 --> 3:59:14.400]  I agree entirely.
[3:59:14.400 --> 3:59:17.880]  The last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down, but
[3:59:17.880 --> 3:59:19.520]  the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[3:59:19.520 --> 3:59:22.400]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[3:59:22.400 --> 3:59:24.760]  I'd love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[3:59:24.760 --> 3:59:27.960]  But if they do shut you down, no, you've gone into this war.
[3:59:27.960 --> 3:59:32.560]  You've won a lot of battles, and there are a lot of people like myself and many others
[3:59:32.560 --> 3:59:33.560]  who are going to continue.
[3:59:33.560 --> 3:59:37.440]  We're going to keep fighting in the Info War, and even if something does happen to you or
[3:59:37.440 --> 3:59:42.280]  your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[3:59:42.280 --> 3:59:47.360]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[3:59:47.360 --> 4:00:15.440]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
