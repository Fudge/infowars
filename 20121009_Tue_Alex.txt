[00:00.000 --> 00:13.320]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:13.320 --> 00:41.560]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:41.560 --> 00:51.120]  ladies and gentlemen it is Tuesday the ninth day of October 2012 and we're
[00:51.120 --> 00:56.520]  going to be here for the next three hours and I'm sitting here thinking of
[00:56.520 --> 01:03.640]  words to describe how precarious the world's position is right now and how
[01:03.640 --> 01:09.400]  to describe how dangerous things are and then I'm thinking well a I can't think
[01:09.400 --> 01:16.000]  of words to describe how serious and dire our straights are but be then I
[01:16.000 --> 01:22.120]  sound like a fearmonger if I come on air and say oh my gosh they've tried this
[01:22.120 --> 01:27.000]  several times in the past they've got proxy wars raging but now they're saying
[01:27.000 --> 01:36.160]  the green light is beginning to come to life when it comes to attacking Iran so
[01:36.160 --> 01:39.880]  I will just cover the news and you can make your own decisions about what this
[01:39.880 --> 01:44.320]  signifies now I'm excited we've got Lindsey Williams coming on a lot of
[01:44.320 --> 01:47.640]  listeners have asked him on and the problem is it doesn't really do him
[01:47.640 --> 01:52.760]  justice when two years ago on this show because I remember him doing it he said
[01:52.760 --> 01:57.600]  you watch the Middle East is even before the Arab Spring started he said you
[01:57.600 --> 02:01.200]  watch the Middle East is next it's going to be revolution it's it's engineered
[02:01.200 --> 02:06.240]  but while all that's happening watch China because China is the real target
[02:06.240 --> 02:12.240]  and he said that actually a little more than two years ago the Pacific fleet
[02:12.240 --> 02:16.360]  hadn't been doubled in size two years ago fact it happened the last year we've
[02:16.360 --> 02:19.960]  seen the Chinese president come out and say prepare for war with the United
[02:19.960 --> 02:23.400]  States that guys we print me that Chinese president says prepare for war
[02:23.400 --> 02:27.720]  Chinese general says prepare for war Chinese admiral says prepare for war
[02:27.720 --> 02:32.960]  they're all saying war war war I mean we've never heard such rhetoric in 50
[02:32.960 --> 02:38.440]  years of chai comms well they've been in 60 plus since 1949 when our own CIA is
[02:38.440 --> 02:43.600]  now declassified they help put Mao Zedong in who the Chinese say killed 86
[02:43.600 --> 02:51.160]  million our CIA says he killed 64 65 million whatever I mean the biggest
[02:51.160 --> 02:55.560]  mass murderer in history and they've got restaurants named after him in London
[02:55.560 --> 03:00.080]  and Denver, Colorado and they've got some club in Austin with Mao all over it
[03:00.080 --> 03:05.120]  I mean it's just very offensive so we're gonna be breaking all of that down
[03:05.120 --> 03:09.800]  with Lindsay in the second hour and I'm gonna really get him just to cut to the
[03:09.800 --> 03:14.180]  chase because he's he you think I'm long-winded I mean he he isn't in
[03:14.180 --> 03:18.360]  dictionary next to the you know image long-winded there's a picture of me
[03:18.360 --> 03:21.960]  he's he's got real sources I know who both of them are one of them's been dead
[03:21.960 --> 03:25.120]  for over a year and a half he's got one source left and it doesn't mean his
[03:25.120 --> 03:29.640]  sources know everything but their Bilderberg group level and he's been
[03:29.640 --> 03:36.840]  right generally about oil prices would go to 150 then they'd fall to 40 everybody
[03:36.840 --> 03:40.560]  laughed at him in both counts it happened so his sources are real I know
[03:40.560 --> 03:44.240]  who they are well you know who one of them is now as he died of cancer a year
[03:44.240 --> 03:49.960]  and a half ago and we're gonna get an update from Lindsey Williams here and
[03:49.960 --> 03:54.240]  hopefully just get it all out in the first 30 minutes and then take 30
[03:54.240 --> 04:01.640]  minutes of calls I'm not sure if he's gonna be here today he lives in
[04:01.640 --> 04:05.400]  California but he also is from Texas and his family here we has a place on the

[04:23.120 --> 04:25.840]  about things and so I don't know if he's gonna be in here the last 30 minutes
[04:25.840 --> 04:29.960]  but he talked to him last week he said he was coming to town we'll see if he
[04:29.960 --> 04:33.720]  shows up just because I never really double-checked on that so we'll see if

[09:17.160 --> 09:24.080]  our boldness our treasure to establish their world government the globalist
[09:24.080 --> 09:29.280]  are dismantling the United States and consolidating and looting and robbing
[09:29.280 --> 09:35.000]  us while they use us to establish their private global corporate world
[09:35.000 --> 09:39.840]  government that has now been openly announced now this is a incredibly
[09:39.840 --> 09:44.920]  important broadcast every day is but it just gets more intense more serious by
[09:44.920 --> 09:51.240]  the day here's the headline out of foreign policy.com that's a Washington
[09:51.240 --> 09:56.880]  Post publication basically of the CFR affiliation a truly credible military
[09:56.880 --> 10:01.720]  threat to Iran and it goes on to say the Israelis and Americans are zoning in on
[10:01.720 --> 10:06.400]  a strike option that has a real chance of deterring the moolas and defusing
[10:06.400 --> 10:13.320]  mit romney's attacks two weeks after we published or a week and a half after we
[10:13.320 --> 10:17.320]  published the new issue of info wars magazine with the headline October
[10:17.320 --> 10:23.000]  surprise war with a question mark last week ABC News came out and said their
[10:23.000 --> 10:27.600]  White House sources are saying that they could launch an attack to win the
[10:27.600 --> 10:37.000]  election and now Obama is meeting again with Benjamin yet in Yahoo so that's
[10:37.000 --> 10:42.000]  out of foreign policy.com here's Harats or Haritz.com big Israeli
[10:42.000 --> 10:46.720]  newspaper US Israel considering joint surgical strike on Iran's nuclear
[10:46.720 --> 10:50.640]  facilities and hey it's not a war if you just bomb them it's not a war I mean if
[10:50.640 --> 10:54.040]  you blow up Libya and kill tens of thousands and bring al-Qaeda in it's
[10:54.040 --> 10:58.160]  not a war of your president's a peace prize winner if you attack Syria for
[10:58.160 --> 11:02.000]  nine months ship in tens of thousands of al-Qaeda blow up the churches blow up
[11:02.000 --> 11:08.600]  the mosque kill the alawite Muslims kill the Shiite Muslims and have Turkey for
[11:08.600 --> 11:17.240]  now seven days shelling hundreds of square miles of Syria it's not a war in
[11:17.240 --> 11:23.400]  so we're gonna be going over all that I mean this is really moving quickly we're
[11:23.400 --> 11:30.280]  going to be breaking all of that down but here it is I mean you got ABC News
[11:30.280 --> 11:35.800]  you've got the Washington Post you've got Harats you've got the Daily Mail hundreds
[11:35.800 --> 11:42.040]  of publications hundreds are saying that there's zoning in and oh it's only a
[11:42.040 --> 11:46.640]  surgical strike it's it's it's no big deal we're just gonna attack Iran and
[11:46.640 --> 11:52.760]  separately you've got the Secretary of Defense Panetta saying this may be a
[11:52.760 --> 11:57.360]  wider regional war you got the former sect def gates saying it will be a
[11:57.360 --> 12:05.200]  quote catastrophe but everything's fine nothing to worry about as you're up
[12:05.200 --> 12:10.120]  melds down as the dollars devalued and as all over the country regular army and
[12:10.120 --> 12:15.920]  Marines from Texas to California to South Carolina to Florida there's just
[12:15.920 --> 12:21.000]  regular army running checkpoints that's no big deal oh there's the army oh they're
[12:21.000 --> 12:25.200]  just got a checkpoint they're just gonna search it oh TSA in all 50 states so
[12:25.200 --> 12:30.400]  yeah and Paul Watson an article in fact I've got to read it today it doesn't
[12:30.400 --> 12:33.640]  matter if I have two guests coming on will you guys reprint me Paul Watson's
[12:33.640 --> 12:38.960]  article yesterday that I mentioned but it has just over 10 examples of Congress
[12:38.960 --> 12:43.760]  people and others saying the TSA punish them by grabbing their genitals and now
[12:43.760 --> 12:47.320]  they say take the body scanner we're gonna crush your generals and then they
[12:47.320 --> 12:51.640]  tell you it's punishment or they don't let you fly and say it's punishment or
[12:51.640 --> 12:56.520]  they rob you and then admit it's punishment on video this is all
[12:56.520 --> 13:01.560]  confirmed so either go in the microwave oven or we're gonna torture you I mean
[13:01.560 --> 13:06.560]  I've got to get to that today to IMFC's alarmingly high risk of deeper global
[13:06.560 --> 13:09.400]  slump but I thought we left the recession four years ago even though
[13:09.400 --> 13:13.760]  every private economist out there that I've talked to says we never left the
[13:13.760 --> 13:18.120]  recession and if you have a recession for more than a year with no growth and
[13:18.120 --> 13:22.120]  continued slumps in the quarters that's called a depression if you add in over
[13:22.120 --> 13:27.360]  20% unemployment and we really got 22% for four years and growing not the oh I
[13:27.360 --> 13:30.760]  mean I guess Obama could say it was zero and you know have his Labor
[13:30.760 --> 13:34.600]  Department say that I mean he could he could promise he didn't have sex with
[13:34.600 --> 13:37.760]  that woman Monica Lewinsky like Bill Clinton did or he could promise he
[13:37.760 --> 13:41.040]  wasn't gonna sign the NDAA and of course sign it or promise and they're not
[13:41.040 --> 13:44.120]  gonna hire a single lobbyist and hire more than George Bush and Bill Clinton
[13:44.120 --> 13:49.280]  combined or you know lie about everything because people like to believe the lies I
[13:49.280 --> 13:56.560]  guess okay let's let's break some of this down this story is linked up at
[13:56.560 --> 14:00.400]  drudgereport.com on the right hand side it's an info wars.com article prison
[14:00.400 --> 14:05.840]  wanted.com article DHS to test spy drones for public safety applications well
[14:05.840 --> 14:09.320]  they're already doing it and then a few months ago they had hundreds of
[14:09.320 --> 14:13.320]  newspapers and a concerted disinformation campaign we covered it here
[14:13.320 --> 14:16.960]  come out and say we're insane they're not gonna use the drones for law
[14:16.960 --> 14:20.720]  enforcement they're not gonna arm them and DHS is doing nothing with drones as
[14:20.720 --> 14:26.960]  DHS uses predator drones to arrest US citizens in places like North Dakota and
[14:26.960 --> 14:33.840]  Texas doesn't matter they came out and said I'm a liar it doesn't exist okay
[14:33.840 --> 14:37.480]  well there you go and I've talked to listeners who've been confronted by
[14:37.480 --> 14:40.680]  their families saying hey they said there's no drones out you that guy's a
[14:40.680 --> 14:45.440]  liar I read to you two different news articles yesterday out of Texas alone
[14:45.440 --> 14:51.520]  saying there are no side effects in vaccines they do not cause side effects
[14:51.520 --> 14:56.720]  period don't listen to wild rumors close quote and then I read from the CDC
[14:56.720 --> 15:03.160]  saying death epilepsy I mean you can get permanent epilepsy not just seizures
[15:03.160 --> 15:08.040]  epilepsy for the rest of your life and the broken teeth and the and the pulled
[15:08.040 --> 15:11.080]  muscles and the brain damage and all that goes with it all the wonderful
[15:11.080 --> 15:16.520]  things that go with it you can just get it all
[15:18.800 --> 15:26.080]  you can certainly get it all and it said right there it can cause you to go
[15:26.080 --> 15:34.600]  into a coma and I mean but but again we're wild conspiracy theorist
[15:38.880 --> 15:42.800]  okay speaking of starting again we're gonna go to break here in a few minutes
[15:42.800 --> 15:49.440]  and we're gonna come back and continue with the news and information but there
[15:49.440 --> 15:56.560]  is a engineered world financial collapse being carried out against this
[15:56.560 --> 16:02.760]  planet and the globalists have bragged in the financial times of London BBC
[16:02.760 --> 16:10.640]  Associated Press Reuters you name it they brag everywhere about what they've
[16:10.640 --> 16:21.800]  done and we're sitting here watching our society being dismantled in front of
[16:21.800 --> 16:28.880]  our very eyes and so we come back I'm gonna get into the move towards selling
[16:28.880 --> 16:35.640]  the public on an attack on Iran the minute Syria falls to Al Qaeda and that
[16:35.640 --> 16:40.760]  is who the main force leading it and around half the soldiers are Al Qaeda
[16:40.760 --> 16:45.560]  with NATO and Turkey that means our government behind it attacking them and
[16:45.560 --> 16:50.280]  it's incredibly immoral and you've got Obama and Mitt Romney fighting and
[16:50.280 --> 17:00.400]  debating with each other on who is the greatest warm hunger and just talking
[17:00.400 --> 17:04.840]  about how horrible the leadership of Syria is who didn't attack anybody and
[17:04.840 --> 17:10.160]  who'd been trying to work with the West just like Libya had come in out of the
[17:10.160 --> 17:13.920]  cold seven years ago invested the country's money with the West Goldman
[17:13.920 --> 17:18.840]  Sachs JPMorgan and others and then was set up rebels were brought in out of
[17:18.840 --> 17:22.920]  Saudi Arabia and Egypt Al Qaeda who were just totally destroying the country
[17:22.920 --> 17:28.040]  we're gonna be getting into that today also the big economic news IMFC is
[17:28.040 --> 17:33.080]  alarmingly high risk of deeper global slump and we're going to get into the
[17:33.080 --> 17:38.040]  Greeks protesting against Merkel and others and that takeover that is taking
[17:38.040 --> 17:43.960]  place and we have Lindsey Williams joining us as well giving us breakdown of

[22:28.120 --> 22:34.560]  the world imagine how hellish it's going to be again ladies and gentlemen we are
[22:34.560 --> 22:42.080]  back live I am Alex Jones your host and we are going to be opening the phones
[22:42.080 --> 22:50.520]  up coming up in the next segment let me just give you some of the headlines that
[22:50.520 --> 22:57.280]  we have here CNN your behavior will be controlled by a brain chip smartphone
[22:57.280 --> 23:07.840]  will be implanted within 75 years and they always say it's going to be 75
[23:07.840 --> 23:13.920]  years when really it's going to be 15 20 years we read with the Pentagon saying
[23:13.920 --> 23:18.640]  because if they come out with the you know latest update well people are going
[23:18.640 --> 23:22.720]  to have to have it and already it's attachments on your glasses attachments
[23:22.720 --> 23:27.640]  inside your ear and the transhumanists who are really eugenicists they say that
[23:27.640 --> 23:30.960]  that's how they're going to force you to accept all this Paul Joseph Watson
[23:30.960 --> 23:37.720]  writes about this at prisonplata.com and info wars.com 13,000 people exposed to
[23:37.720 --> 23:42.600]  big pharma shots contaminated with rare fungal meningitis and what's the media's
[23:42.600 --> 23:49.600]  answer take vaccines of course so we're going to be breaking down those reports
[23:49.600 --> 23:55.040]  I've got this out of the Chicago sometimes Cook County mulling violence
[23:55.040 --> 24:00.120]  tax on guns and ammunition because the guns and ammunition made Chicago the
[24:00.120 --> 24:07.120]  murder capital of the world a culture of welfare and big government and
[24:07.120 --> 24:11.520]  gangsterism is what did this to the great city of Chicago where they've got
[24:11.520 --> 24:16.560]  near total gun restrictions but in the county outside well Illinois got
[24:16.560 --> 24:20.760]  restrictive gun laws victim disarmament laws we still get ammo and guns so they
[24:20.760 --> 24:28.880]  want taxes on firearms and they want taxes on what 10 cents per bullet and
[24:28.880 --> 24:35.920]  even proposed charging 50 cents per bullet so that's what's going on there
[24:35.920 --> 24:45.720]  and with a big bill also on each firearm as if legal citizens you know
[24:45.720 --> 24:50.320]  criminals buy them on the street they rob them out of your house anybody who
[24:50.320 --> 24:56.680]  knows that knows criminals don't follow gun laws that's why New York Chicago LA
[24:56.680 --> 25:00.760]  places with dr. Coney and anti-gun laws have the highest crime rates in the
[25:00.760 --> 25:05.520]  country sure you I mean even in a bad economy in areas where you have a second
[25:05.520 --> 25:09.320]  amendment you may have your car get broken into you may get stuff stolen out
[25:09.320 --> 25:12.680]  of your garage but they don't do the breaking and entering the home invasions
[25:12.680 --> 25:17.000]  I mean the statistics are off the chart in areas where you have disarmed
[25:17.000 --> 25:24.840]  victims so we have that report there and then of course we reported on this
[25:24.840 --> 25:29.600]  Sunday and then on the Monday show people thought we were joking Sunday when
[25:29.600 --> 25:34.120]  I just mentioned this and then I saw comments and things on info wars going
[25:34.120 --> 25:37.480]  wow you I thought you were joking on the radio and went to the site and saw that
[25:37.480 --> 25:44.520]  this is in WW J TV it's in the Associated Press Fox News enter at your
[25:44.520 --> 25:49.480]  own risk police union says war like Detroit is unsafe for visitors and
[25:49.480 --> 25:55.040]  they're posting signs up and of course what do they want they want higher pay
[25:55.040 --> 26:00.040]  so they're it's a form of holding people hostage saying give us more pay and
[26:00.040 --> 26:05.200]  we're gonna put signs up saying enter at your own risk and and they are getting
[26:05.200 --> 26:08.560]  shot they are getting killed I mean I had to be it's what government and
[26:08.560 --> 26:14.000]  globalism and NAFTA and GATT and the Union selling out does you know the
[26:14.000 --> 26:17.280]  unions just want to legalize illegal aliens and you know give their money
[26:17.280 --> 26:21.040]  to ban the second amendment so that you know the unions are basically shot they
[26:21.040 --> 26:24.680]  sold you out to NAFTA and GATT so I don't blame the police you're being
[26:24.680 --> 26:28.760]  upset I mean take Oakland they announced two years ago 35 crimes they won't
[26:28.760 --> 26:34.920]  respond to including home invasions you name it but they're gonna be there still
[26:34.920 --> 26:38.680]  revenue generating and and and hundreds and hundreds of sheriff's
[26:38.680 --> 26:42.440]  departments police departments have announced some of them 60 80% cuts many
[26:42.440 --> 26:47.520]  I'm 50% cuts in the number of officers but don't worry there's more federal
[26:47.520 --> 26:55.320]  officers I see federal police vehicles big black armored vehicles police cars
[26:55.320 --> 26:59.200]  you name it just just driving around everywhere it's totally illegal but
[26:59.200 --> 27:03.560]  shows having troops on the streets violates Posse Comontatus and other laws
[27:03.560 --> 27:13.880]  but so what so enter Detroit at your own risk police tell tiger fans and also
[27:13.880 --> 27:17.520]  Monsanto found guilty of chemical poisoning and landmark case you know
[27:17.520 --> 27:22.480]  I'm very upset and I'm trying to maintain my cool here today I got so upset
[27:22.480 --> 27:26.520]  earlier I literally had to go off air which doesn't happen quite often that's
[27:26.520 --> 27:30.240]  why you heard music for a few minutes because I've tried to tell myself I'm
[27:30.240 --> 27:35.600]  not gonna start screaming today not gonna start screaming but World War three

[31:33.680 --> 31:38.240]  see the economic meltdown worldwide we see governments moving forward with
[31:38.240 --> 31:44.920]  scientific systems of authoritarian control we now have headlines that
[31:44.920 --> 31:53.640]  Obama may preempt Romney in the Washington Post and ABC News by attacking
[31:53.640 --> 31:57.800]  Iran so they're admitting it's about politics now just hiding it in plain
[31:57.800 --> 32:04.440]  view kind of like I can play Fox news pieces BBC pieces ABC news pieces I've
[32:04.440 --> 32:08.560]  played them here on air where they show US troops guarding and helping grow
[32:08.560 --> 32:14.840]  opium in Afghanistan that is then shipped into the United States I mean they
[32:14.840 --> 32:18.760]  hide in plain view that Pat Tillman was murdered for speaking out about it they
[32:18.760 --> 32:22.600]  hide it in plain view that our troops are forced to grow drugs that are then
[32:22.600 --> 32:26.920]  shipped into our country and then the police want to search your car for
[32:26.920 --> 32:31.560]  drugs criminal elements of the government publicly shipped in and now
[32:31.560 --> 32:35.200]  it's hidden in plain view that they're putting al Qaeda into Libya they took it
[32:35.200 --> 32:39.600]  over a year and a half ago now they're taking over Syria and they're spinning it
[32:39.600 --> 32:46.920]  that NATO may have to attack Syria now because a few mortars a day are getting
[32:46.920 --> 32:51.600]  shot over the border and then they lied last week and said that Syria had said
[32:51.600 --> 32:56.120]  they were doing it Syria is like it's a false flag why on earth would we attack
[32:56.120 --> 33:00.240]  the biggest military in the Middle East Turkey has the biggest conventional
[33:00.240 --> 33:06.680]  military bigger than Israel's very high-tech huge part of NATO I mean f-16s
[33:06.680 --> 33:14.040]  f-18s high-powered weapons the list just goes on and on huge conventional
[33:14.040 --> 33:21.840]  military lined up with tanks f-16s all of it moved to the border and then
[33:21.840 --> 33:26.240]  somebody keeps shooting mortars over in the foreign presses reporting that they
[33:26.240 --> 33:31.440]  found an unexploded one in that it's a NATO mortar well I mean yeah they're
[33:31.440 --> 33:35.200]  bringing al Qaeda in out of Turkey and the Russians are there and I've been
[33:35.200 --> 33:39.040]  able to hold back al Qaeda from taking over Damascus but they're in street
[33:39.040 --> 33:43.480]  fighting they're now nine months into this they finally don't call them
[33:43.480 --> 33:49.360]  peaceful protesters on the news and again I'm not for the Syrian government but
[33:49.360 --> 33:53.360]  they're angels compared to al Qaeda I mean look at these headlines a truly
[33:53.360 --> 33:57.960]  incredible military threat to Iran the Israelis and the Americans are zeroing
[33:57.960 --> 34:02.440]  in on a strike option that is a real chance of deterring the Mullahs and
[34:02.440 --> 34:09.960]  defusing Mitt Romney's attacks and it goes on to say in Mitt Romney's hope is
[34:09.960 --> 34:13.080]  not a strategy speech the Virginia Military Institute the Republican
[34:13.080 --> 34:16.560]  Challenger zeroed in on the current unrest the Middle East is a sign that
[34:16.560 --> 34:21.000]  President Barack Obama's foreign policy is not working the most biting
[34:21.000 --> 34:25.320]  implication of speeches the assertion that al Qaeda is resurgent in other
[34:25.320 --> 34:29.880]  words that killing Osama bin Laden emotionally satisfying as it was was
[34:29.880 --> 34:33.320]  not the game changer that the region that Obama administration was implying it
[34:33.320 --> 34:39.280]  was I mean that whole narrative by both sides is like a Dr. Seuss book or
[34:39.280 --> 34:46.320]  something I mean it's a fable I hear it on the news like well al Qaeda is getting
[34:46.320 --> 34:52.520]  strong again we better take your rights away I'm like the government brought
[34:52.520 --> 34:57.480]  al Qaeda in the government gave them the missiles the government is training them
[34:57.480 --> 35:01.520]  and arming them and funding them and I mean it's admitted in the news but it
[35:01.520 --> 35:06.960]  like they just reported dryly in the back of the paper and then separately I
[35:06.960 --> 35:12.120]  hear on neocon radio my gosh he's not fighting al Qaeda al Qaeda killed the
[35:12.120 --> 35:22.220]  ambassador and in Benghazi and and Obama's soft on al Qaeda soft on al Qaeda the
[35:22.220 --> 35:28.080]  neocons and the CFR have been supporting the policy of of bedlam and
[35:28.080 --> 35:33.480]  chaos in the Middle East and a civil war between the Sunni majority 80% and
[35:33.480 --> 35:41.360]  the Shiite 19 and 1% al-await and others Iran is Shiite Saudi Arabia the
[35:41.360 --> 35:48.760]  globalist ally is Sunni and the sub sect of al Qaeda Wahhabist and that's that
[35:48.760 --> 35:53.240]  they're there they're basically all Sunnis and Wahhabist that are there
[35:53.240 --> 36:00.920]  attacking Syria okay it's it's Sunnis and if you go online you'll notice Sunni
[36:00.920 --> 36:04.840]  groups threatening me and saying bad things about me I'm not a Shiite I'm
[36:04.840 --> 36:09.800]  not a Sunni I'm a Christian I come from Baptist I don't know I don't want to see
[36:09.800 --> 36:13.920]  your countries leveled and destroyed I don't want to have World War three but
[36:13.920 --> 36:20.920]  I mean this is crazy our governments are publicly funding al Qaeda while telling
[36:20.920 --> 36:27.720]  us separately that Obama isn't tough on al Qaeda so this article goes on this is
[36:27.720 --> 36:31.480]  what so-called intellectuals that subscribe to the Washington Post foreign
[36:31.480 --> 36:39.560]  policy think they're real smart when they read it I mean this is just amazing
[36:39.560 --> 36:45.600]  that this type of stuff goes on and you've got it in Haritz you've got it in
[36:45.600 --> 36:49.680]  the Washington Post you've got it in the Daily Mail they're all
[36:49.680 --> 37:02.600]  reporting that oh hey we've got to attack Syria and we've got to attack Iran
[37:02.600 --> 37:09.720]  because Obama's got to get tough on al Qaeda when Syria is fighting al Qaeda and
[37:09.720 --> 37:14.400]  Iran is fighting al Qaeda I mean again this is I know I marvel at this every
[37:14.400 --> 37:19.000]  day but this is so over-the-top ladies and gentlemen that I don't even have
[37:19.000 --> 37:27.000]  words to describe it it's like saying that the Oakland baseball team is the
[37:27.000 --> 37:32.640]  New York baseball team it's like saying the Oakland Yankees when it's the New
[37:32.640 --> 37:36.840]  York Yankees I mean it's that stupid they think the public is that dumb and
[37:36.840 --> 37:42.560]  you know what the public is that ignorant not so much dumb but absolutely
[37:42.560 --> 37:52.800]  totally and completely ignorant ignorant beyond imagination and they go on to say
[37:52.800 --> 37:58.120]  if he hits Iran with Netanyahu he'll win the election and that's the message
[37:58.120 --> 38:02.400]  that neocons last year told Obama they said elections coming up next year and
[38:02.400 --> 38:10.080]  you better hit Iran we'll get behind you and what's a neocon that's the Trotsky
[38:10.080 --> 38:14.720]  aides that got run out of Russia down to Mexico and they came into the US and
[38:14.720 --> 38:18.960]  crystals dad and the rest of them are hard we're hardcore communist and they
[38:18.960 --> 38:23.480]  said well we weren't able to take over acting like communists we'll just call
[38:23.480 --> 38:27.120]  ourselves conservatives and then conservatives in the 70s and 80s said
[38:27.120 --> 38:35.840]  your neocons when that term was coined in the late 70s your neocons and we're
[38:35.840 --> 38:40.560]  not going to have anything to do with you your big government fake
[38:40.560 --> 38:45.840]  conservatives here to infiltrate conservative movements and take over and
[38:45.840 --> 38:49.360]  Ronald Reagan spoke about that until he got told of the convention you put
[38:49.360 --> 38:54.440]  George Herbert Walker Bush on your ticket or you're not getting in but this is so
[38:54.440 --> 39:03.360]  crazy even the James Baker you know types the the the Brent Scowcrofts the
[39:03.360 --> 39:08.280]  former Secretary of Defense Gates are coming out saying we ought to use other
[39:08.280 --> 39:15.440]  means with Iran if you strike them it is going to absolutely turn the entire
[39:15.440 --> 39:19.480]  Middle East against us what they want to do is just have civil wars over there
[39:19.480 --> 39:25.160]  and have the Shiites and Sunnis kill each other but some of the Israeli lobby
[39:25.160 --> 39:30.720]  the Likudniks and others they want to get a hot war going just because they
[39:30.720 --> 39:34.720]  think it'll give them more political power and it certainly will will it be
[39:34.720 --> 39:40.520]  good for Israel no but it'll be good for the political class over there that
[39:40.520 --> 39:44.280]  once they commit people to a big war folks tend to line up and do what they're
[39:44.280 --> 39:49.080]  told so that's where all this is going and this is a big big big big earth
[39:49.080 --> 39:54.280]  shaking events that are lining up right now and you notice it's all happening as
[39:54.280 --> 39:57.040]  the world economy melts down they're not the globalists are gonna take the
[39:57.040 --> 40:00.200]  blame for a total meltdown they're gonna stage a big war in the middle of the
[40:00.200 --> 40:05.200]  meltdown and to get everybody to accept all the austerity and the new taxes
[40:05.200 --> 40:12.000]  after all you know the terrorist they set a nuke off in a major city after all
[40:12.000 --> 40:16.960]  they released smallpox after all and then you notice before all this happens
[40:16.960 --> 40:20.800]  before they stage these false flags they've got the control grid all set up
[40:20.800 --> 40:26.440]  and in place so that's why I'm so desperate to try to articulate this to
[40:26.440 --> 40:31.840]  people I am so desperate to try to get people to realize how much danger we're
[40:31.840 --> 40:36.880]  in I mean look at these headlines the Israelis and Americans are zeroing in
[40:36.880 --> 40:43.960]  on a strike option that has a real chance of deterring the moolas and diffusing
[40:43.960 --> 40:50.680]  Romney's attacks US Israel considering joint surgical strike on Iran's nuclear
[40:50.680 --> 40:58.280]  facilities and it's got all these Clinton officials and people saying that
[40:58.280 --> 41:03.600]  this is the way it's going it goes on they break down how the US is going to
[41:03.600 --> 41:07.680]  back up the strikes Ahmed energy now concedes an attack could be coming
[41:07.680 --> 41:15.400]  that's in why net news turkey deploys 25 f-16s the Syrian border they're now in
[41:15.400 --> 41:20.600]  today's seven of shelling the country but it's not a war Turkish president says
[41:20.600 --> 41:26.640]  worst case unfolding in Syria and calls for NATO to protect them oh NATO that
[41:26.640 --> 41:30.920]  they're part of protect us from the Syrians that can barely barely hold
[41:30.920 --> 41:37.120]  Damascus from al-Qaeda forces with MI6 CIA and others backing them I mean there
[41:37.120 --> 41:42.840]  are US personnel in Syria on record blowing up buildings blowing up their
[41:42.840 --> 41:49.000]  military bases blowing up their police stations with al-Qaeda and letting al-Qaeda
[41:49.000 --> 41:54.040]  go and burn churches and blow them up and throw Christians off roofs and make
[41:54.040 --> 41:57.200]  families you know tell a father we're gonna kill your family if you don't go
[41:57.200 --> 42:04.000]  car bomb for us I mean this is so incredibly immoral and it can only be
[42:04.000 --> 42:07.920]  carried out because when you even read establishment Washington Post or other
[42:07.920 --> 42:12.280]  publications it's written at a third grade level so cold intelligentsia sits
[42:12.280 --> 42:16.880]  down and thinks they're reading this and getting what's really going on where
[42:16.880 --> 42:22.160]  they say we are obama can attack Iran and show that he's tough on al-Qaeda it
[42:22.160 --> 42:25.920]  actually says this today in newspapers across the country that's the talking
[42:25.920 --> 42:30.040]  point the average America will say good al-Qaeda well they just had a federal
[42:30.040 --> 42:38.040]  judge rule that I ran did 9-11 a federal judge in New York says so or does it
[42:38.040 --> 42:45.720]  New Jersey I mean this is getting absolutely ridiculous I'm going to log
[42:45.720 --> 42:49.760]  in here to my phone system I think that's probably important to do so I can
[42:49.760 --> 42:53.240]  get the calls and I'm gonna give out the number in this segment the next take a
[42:53.240 --> 42:57.720]  few calls on this issue I mean are you concerned about this or are you looking
[42:57.720 --> 43:01.160]  forward to what they admit could turn into a well it's already a regional war
[43:01.160 --> 43:05.160]  and could turn into a new world war that you like the fleet numbers doubling
[43:05.160 --> 43:09.640]  around China and China saying prepare for war with the US and you think a proxy
[43:09.640 --> 43:13.480]  war with the Russians going on in Syria is no big deal with the backdrop of the
[43:13.480 --> 43:19.440]  IMF saying alarmingly high risk of deeper global slump but I mean I thought we
[43:19.440 --> 43:22.560]  were in a wonderful boom economy the last four years four years ago the
[43:22.560 --> 43:28.720]  recession ended here's the headline think tank path to Iran nuke war had two
[43:28.720 --> 43:33.280]  to four months you know the AP they've got to hit them after drone Israel
[43:33.280 --> 43:37.960]  deploys missile defense unit on the Lebanese border get ready for that
[43:37.960 --> 43:45.440]  proxy war Rasmussen NATO will defend Turkey from Syria if necessary the head
[43:45.440 --> 43:51.960]  of NATO Anders Rasmussen says military alliance has plans in place to defend
[43:51.960 --> 44:00.080]  Syria or or to defend Anacar after Syria gunfire and shelling spills in the
[44:00.080 --> 44:05.680]  Turkish territory Turkish army shuffles units bolsters presence along border
[44:05.680 --> 44:10.720]  well thank goodness man I tell you because there's an attack on Turkey right
[44:10.720 --> 44:15.720]  now a few mortars came over well we done we've got to get in there and carpet
[44:15.720 --> 44:24.080]  bomb like they did Libya for peace yes yes because al-Qaeda Obama's got to get
[44:24.080 --> 44:30.600]  tough and bomb Iran and Syria because al-Qaeda is there that NATO is arming
[44:30.600 --> 44:36.240]  and commanding I mean it's just so over the top that I feel like I'm in a
[44:36.240 --> 44:43.880]  dream now man I tell you this is crazy misfire NATO mortar gift from Turkey to
[44:43.880 --> 44:48.600]  Syrian rebels newspapers reporting can link through to that at info wars.com
[44:48.600 --> 44:54.280]  NATO design mortar use an attack blamed on Syria yeah false flag and we've got
[44:54.280 --> 44:58.320]  the people that basically run the Pentagon on C-SPAN saying let's just
[44:58.320 --> 45:03.240]  stage something to get the war going two weeks ago and then it came out that
[45:03.240 --> 45:07.640]  Bush and Blair had a plan to get US aircraft shot down painted up like UN
[45:07.640 --> 45:11.680]  make sure the pilots died and say it was a UN aircraft the U.M. was going to
[45:11.680 --> 45:15.760]  play along Cheney wanted to attack our ships with boats painted up like Iranian
[45:15.760 --> 45:20.040]  patrol boats that came out New Yorker magazine Obama's continuing it as his
[45:20.040 --> 45:27.200]  October surprise there is a very good chance according to ABC news after we
[45:27.200 --> 45:30.640]  said it of course the point is this is in the cards and if we don't talk about
[45:30.640 --> 45:35.000]  it they're going to go ahead and do it we have a chance of stopping it then if
[45:35.000 --> 45:38.640]  we do stop it as we've done two other times our millions of listeners by
[45:38.640 --> 45:43.120]  informing people then oh there was never going to be an attack and I ran and Alex
[45:43.120 --> 45:47.080]  said there was a war in Libya in Syria when those aren't wars those are peace
[45:47.080 --> 45:52.160]  prize actions see it's all semantical games Alex where's the global meltdown
[45:52.160 --> 45:57.160]  financially you talked about the world's doing great the news said so see how
[45:57.160 --> 46:06.480]  these mind games are played 800 259 92 31 800 259 92 31 and we'll get you up and
[46:06.480 --> 46:09.920]  on the air and you'll get a chance to talk to Lindsay Williams who's coming up
[46:09.920 --> 46:14.120]  but I'll take calls the next two segments ahead of him joining us this is the
[46:14.120 --> 46:17.720]  type of stuff going on and then you integrated in with the world news of
[46:17.720 --> 46:21.680]  financial meltdown run by the people that stand to gain from it who who
[46:21.680 --> 46:27.560]  engineered it posing as saviors we've got all that going on we've got all
[46:27.560 --> 46:32.640]  sorts of bizarre deaths going on in Greece of whistleblowers that exposed
[46:32.640 --> 46:37.800]  the banking takeover there you've got the Greeks dressing up like Hitler
[46:37.800 --> 46:41.880]  pointing out the Germans invaded during World War two and took over Greece and
[46:41.880 --> 46:45.800]  saying Merkel who's calling for them to work seven days a week and pay even more
[46:45.800 --> 46:50.640]  money to bail out banks she's been you know been calling them lazy along with
[46:50.640 --> 46:55.640]  along with LeGrand and so they're protesting her and the police are on
[46:55.640 --> 47:01.000]  record breaking people's arms torturing them and beating them same thing in
[47:01.000 --> 47:05.160]  Madrid you go out and protest in Madrid the fact that you got 50% unemployment in
[47:05.160 --> 47:09.040]  that city that's on the news they just come out and beat you have to death in
[47:09.040 --> 47:13.000]  fact some people been killed Greek anti-fascist protesters tortured by
[47:13.000 --> 47:17.960]  police after golden dawn clash 15 people arrested Nathan says they were
[47:17.960 --> 47:22.800]  subjected to what their lawyer describes as Abu Ghraib style humiliation yeah
[47:22.800 --> 47:27.200]  that happened to our crew when they got arrested at the G20 in Pittsburgh three
[47:27.200 --> 47:31.320]  years ago or two years ago Rob do want a lawsuit over that I'm not gonna say on
[47:31.320 --> 47:35.320]  air again what they did didn't some of people that do witness they didn't do it
[47:35.320 --> 47:41.640]  to him but it was well I'm just gonna get to it on air the point is is that
[47:41.640 --> 47:46.160]  this is the new culture people think evils cool death is cool murderous
[47:46.160 --> 47:53.840]  cool quick announcement here we are gonna engage in the fifth annual money
[47:53.840 --> 47:57.840]  bomb because we're not funded by taxpayer money like MSNBC and NPR and
[47:57.840 --> 48:02.360]  others oh yeah even MSNBC gets it we're funded by sponsors and others but
[48:02.360 --> 48:05.640]  having these money bombs that sometimes raised four hundred five hundred
[48:05.640 --> 48:09.560]  thousand dollars allows me to hire some more crew buy the equipment and finish
[48:09.560 --> 48:14.960]  some studios and get the satellite uplinks and I wasn't gonna do a money
[48:14.960 --> 48:18.200]  bomb because overall we could probably still fun things even though we're
[48:18.200 --> 48:21.120]  going into a depression thanks to people buying the books the videos the
[48:21.120 --> 48:25.440]  products but detractors don't like it and and tell us we better not have a
[48:25.440 --> 48:29.920]  money bomb that it's evil to be in free association and ask for support so
[48:29.920 --> 48:35.280]  because of that we will be having a 48 hour live transmission the the 18th to
[48:35.280 --> 48:39.680]  19th of October and we're going for our biggest money bomb ever to just push it

[49:07.360 --> 49:10.480]  sure what the food police are so afraid of these remarkable foods have been
[49:10.480 --> 49:13.320]  around since the beginning of history with archaeological evidence for

[52:13.320 --> 52:21.480]  yeah
[52:21.480 --> 52:28.440]  tyrants need to fear the people not the people fearing the bureaucrats when the
[52:28.440 --> 52:32.120]  people fear government there is tyranny when government fears the people
[52:32.120 --> 52:35.760]  there is liberty of course that's a terrorist Thomas Jefferson FEMA does
[52:35.760 --> 52:41.200]  teach Thomas Jefferson was a terrorist and is bad and is the enemy of what
[52:41.200 --> 52:45.280]  America has now become a nation of control freak bureaucrats in their
[52:45.280 --> 52:49.920]  bureaucrats speech taking over our society now again it is being reported
[52:49.920 --> 52:56.800]  that a armada of aircraft and drones is being readied for an attack on Iran and
[52:56.800 --> 53:04.000]  that that is Obama's October surprise to deal a death blow to Al Qaeda and again
[53:04.000 --> 53:09.840]  Iran is sheite the opposite of Al Qaeda but it doesn't matter because the system
[53:09.840 --> 53:14.520]  knows it's playing to the average American who literally has no idea what
[53:14.520 --> 53:20.520]  planet they're even living on so pretty darn amazing let's go to your phone
[53:20.520 --> 53:24.680]  calls on all of these issues I've been discussing let's talk to Michael in
[53:24.680 --> 53:30.160]  Texas Michael you're watching us at prison planet TV the video what is your
[53:30.160 --> 53:35.280]  take on all this should I be concerned about the fact that the former sec death
[53:35.280 --> 53:39.200]  says it'll be a catastrophe if they attack in a more and more their green
[53:39.200 --> 53:44.400]  lighting it and they have proxy wars going in Syria and Libya or or those
[53:44.400 --> 53:49.520]  not wars am I wrong to call that a war with Turkey attacking a NATO shipping
[53:49.520 --> 53:54.320]  Al Qaeda and maybe it's not a war maybe war is peace maybe it is peace maybe I'm
[53:54.320 --> 54:00.840]  wrong maybe I am the evil one no it's absolutely a war and I appreciate you
[54:00.840 --> 54:07.280]  taking my call for some color you know I'm a dad a husband and I'm absolutely
[54:07.280 --> 54:14.320]  infuriated infuriated it's absolutely insane what they're doing and it upsets
[54:14.320 --> 54:19.760]  me you know I have a little girl she's five and I look at her and it just
[54:19.760 --> 54:24.080]  sometimes brings me to tears that if they continue that the path they're on
[54:24.080 --> 54:29.080]  she's not gonna have a future well that's right and instead the military
[54:29.080 --> 54:32.320]  industrial complex that terrorists like President Eisenhower because you
[54:32.320 --> 54:35.440]  disagree with big government you're a terrorist now the Army's own manual will
[54:35.440 --> 54:39.280]  say if you don't even like mainstream ideologies that means what they're
[54:39.280 --> 54:44.480]  pumping at you you are a terrorist so Eisenhower said watch out the the
[54:44.480 --> 54:48.040]  bureaucracies and corporate bureaucracies of the military industrial
[54:48.040 --> 54:52.600]  complex have already taken over now his full speech he says a technocratic
[54:52.600 --> 54:57.520]  elite is in control of this and we're gonna lose our freedoms because they'd
[54:57.520 --> 55:01.000]  come to him wanting to stage terror attacks it's been declassified and set
[55:01.000 --> 55:05.400]  up martial law then they'd offered him basically dictatorship that's why he's
[55:05.400 --> 55:09.840]  looking paranoid during that TV address and then somebody dropped something in
[55:09.840 --> 55:13.680]  its slams and he jumps in his chair because he understood he'd been offered
[55:13.680 --> 55:18.200]  a dictatorship and he was just wanting to get out of there but here we are all
[55:18.200 --> 55:21.640]  those years later they're finally getting what they want it's just the
[55:21.640 --> 55:25.520]  president's her puppets the bureaucrats and the corporate interests are now the
[55:25.520 --> 55:30.840]  dictators collectively and the average American doesn't even know there's
[55:30.840 --> 55:34.320]  giant wars going on they don't even know the Chinese generals have said
[55:34.320 --> 55:38.480]  prepare for war and that ships are massing off the coast of China they
[55:38.480 --> 55:43.000]  just think that we're able to even know the name China if you even know where
[55:43.000 --> 55:47.800]  China's at that's some type of evil being informed is now evil you understand
[55:47.800 --> 55:51.600]  that oh absolutely no I know absolutely I was having a conversation with my
[55:51.600 --> 55:56.600]  friend yesterday and he's you know somewhat awake and I was just breaking
[55:56.600 --> 56:00.360]  all this knowledge down to him and he was like is it that bad Michael I said
[56:00.360 --> 56:05.320]  listen but all you have to do is take five minutes out of your day five
[56:05.320 --> 56:10.520]  minutes not even five minutes go into a search engine and type it in it's right
[56:10.520 --> 56:16.800]  there people have become so complacent the word about some call arrested the
[56:16.800 --> 56:22.040]  word about oh my god that new TV shows coming out that's so funny and meanwhile
[56:22.040 --> 56:26.560]  al-qaeda is being turned loose on innocent countries and our government
[56:26.560 --> 56:38.440]  runs them this is GCN the Genesis Communications Radio Network

[56:43.540 --> 56:48.000]  farmers Americans are losing access not just a raw milk and homemade cheeses but
[56:48.000 --> 56:51.520]  to healthy home crafted sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut yogurt
[56:51.520 --> 56:55.080]  and kefir it seems there's a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes
[56:55.080 --> 56:58.680]  and healthy bacteria but frankly I'm not sure what the food police are so afraid
[56:58.680 --> 57:01.680]  of these remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history
[57:01.680 --> 57:04.760]  with archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found
[57:04.760 --> 57:08.720]  across the globe in almost every culture even today Japanese eat miso
[57:08.720 --> 57:13.120]  Africans eat fermented porges Koreans eat kamichi and in India fermented milk
[57:13.120 --> 57:16.520]  is a staple for healthy living but here's some good news South Reliant
[57:16.520 --> 57:19.880]  Americans can now discover the secrets to making these amazing fermented foods

[58:34.320 --> 58:38.800]  against tyranny Lindsey Williams with his amazing inside sources that
[58:38.800 --> 58:42.520]  have proven to be quite accurate I predicted two years ago we've now seen
[58:42.520 --> 58:47.080]  the Middle East we said when that's happening that's a diversion look to
[58:47.080 --> 58:51.280]  China and then since then we've seen the massing of the ships all of it he's
[58:51.280 --> 58:55.720]  coming up and we'll take your calls while he's on with us right now let's go
[58:55.720 --> 59:00.560]  back to your calls let's talk to Zach in Tennessee Zach you're on the air
[59:00.560 --> 59:05.920]  welcome so buddy I called in the other day but I was wondering if you saw the
[59:05.920 --> 59:12.280]  article on drudgerport.com on the left-hand side says one-third of
[59:12.280 --> 59:18.920]  adults under 30 have no religious affiliation yes I saw that and they'll
[59:18.920 --> 59:23.720]  soon have us like England where where people's only religion is worshiping
[59:23.720 --> 59:27.440]  government worshiping weakness and people say well who needs a religion well
[59:27.440 --> 59:33.160]  then you know people will have nothing but materialism and material isn't
[59:33.160 --> 59:36.520]  matter of itself but if it's your god it's very destructive and I did see
[59:36.520 --> 59:44.480]  that report yes it says one-fifth of the US public so that's almost 25% and it's
[59:44.480 --> 59:48.240]  the highest percentage ever it's just extremely concerning man I can't I can't
[59:48.240 --> 59:52.200]  believe that everyone says they're spiritual but not religious now well what
[59:52.200 --> 59:57.280]  happens is it is is once the people stand for nothing they will fall for
[59:57.280 --> 01:00:01.160]  anything the cliche goes and again the globalist first get the churches to
[01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:04.740]  water down to become government then everybody leaves the churches and they
[01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:09.840]  tell them we'll get even more government and that'll bring people back and they
[01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:13.760]  want people rudderless but you know the fact that people are leaving the
[01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:17.400]  churches in droves that's because they know it's nothing but a government
[01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:21.120]  conduit a propaganda so I don't think those numbers are all bad I mean I did
[01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:25.720]  see a little part about where most of them say they're spiritual so I mean in
[01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:29.200]  a way that's kind of positive at least it's not like Europe where something
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:34.840]  like 80% don't believe in anything and no spirituality you know they just they
[01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:40.200]  just think you know government's God you're scannarian stuff that we're just
[01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:46.400]  animals to be programmed and so they just submit to anything
[01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:51.680]  right so yeah I'm looking at this it says two-thirds of them say they believe in
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:57.640]  God so I guess it's agnostic or atheist but yeah I agree well look I mean I've
[01:00:57.640 --> 01:01:00.920]  just found those people generally not all of them but generally they just go
[01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:04.720]  along with tyranny as well they just have a show what life's nothing do whatever
[01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:09.640]  you want let's talk to Woody in Washington Woody you're on the air hey
[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:14.400]  Alex how are you today good bud hey you're gonna do your money bomb again this
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:21.400]  year yes I certainly am when you do it I contributed last year just so you know
[01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:24.720]  and I'll probably contribute this year could you could you play some of your
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:30.200]  old interviews with Bob Chapman I think more now than ever we probably need to
[01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:34.000]  hear some of Bob's wisdom yeah we're always so busy chasing the you know
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.560]  latest story that we don't tend to ever have time to go back and do justice to
[01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:41.840]  that but all of the interviews I did with him over the last four or five
[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:46.160]  years you know they go back 16 17 but for some reason only three or four or
[01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:50.120]  five years are on YouTube people should go listen to them and decide which ones
[01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:54.360]  that I think we should air but I think that's a good idea to maybe you know air
[01:01:54.360 --> 01:02:00.720]  an hour or two of Bob Chapman here on the radio that's a great idea we're gonna
[01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:06.800]  do a 48 hours of continued radio slash TV starting on the 18th at Thursday
[01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:14.400]  through Friday into Saturday kicks off 11 a.m. central on the 18th yeah like
[01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:20.040]  did you maybe have some of your reporters do a little bit more updating
[01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:24.360]  with the chemtrailing yeah I mean we have articles constantly about the
[01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:29.960]  admitted geoengineering and the admissions and members of the EU
[01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:34.360]  Parliament going public about it so many people just want us to point up at it
[01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:37.520]  and say oh look it's there but no one ever seems to want to look at all the
[01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:40.800]  admissions that they're doing it so I'm kind of like alright everybody just
[01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:44.240]  wants to go off rumors instead of the total admissions of it so I'm just kind
[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:52.080]  of like alright we'll be right back stay with us the silver lungs generator is

[01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:50.680]  new studies suggest that the opposite that the preservatives may actually be

[01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:59.440]  is supposed to fight tooth decay but could it also cause cancer oh yeah the
[01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:03.960]  government had the right under us law to conduct secret testing on the American
[01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:07.720]  public under specific condition we have to work with dark side over the last
[01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:13.560]  been tied in the shadows any attempt to achieve world order must be the work of
[01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:18.080]  the devil will join me and I'm glad to sit here at the right hand to say there's
[01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:26.800]  a need for a new world order someday in the next few years a solution
[01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:42.600]  willing ladies and gentlemen joining us this hour perhaps a little bit into the
[01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:48.080]  next hour his pastor Lindsay Williams will break him down for new listeners here
[01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:51.680]  in just a moment I know since he was on with us six months ago we've gained
[01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:57.360]  probably 35 40 affiliates and more and more coming every week again I'm Alex
[01:07:57.360 --> 01:08:02.160]  Jones your host what is the solution to bring in the new world order well the
[01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:05.280]  council on foreign relations which was set up by British intelligence to take
[01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:11.120]  over the US the Financial Times of London the Bilderberg group speaking at
[01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:19.040]  Davos they've all said a global financial meltdown is the plan to totally
[01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:25.560]  and completely dominate society they bankrupt us get us to sign on to their
[01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:29.840]  too big to fail by threatening to fully implode if we don't then they still
[01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:35.040]  implode things and then they are the arbiters the referees the bosses and
[01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:40.760]  basically destroy the once free free market system and replace it with a
[01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:46.280]  corporate fascist crony monopoly model where they are exempt from their own
[01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:50.880]  global government they call the shots and are exempt from the draconian
[01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:58.160]  feudalistic laws that they put upon us neo feudalistic serfdom is the system
[01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:02.800]  and I've been saying that for 15 years that term has now been adopted neo
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:08.160]  feudalistic serfdom and the neo liberals push the same thing the neo
[01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:12.440]  cons push the same thing they act like there's differences the incredible news
[01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:19.400]  is the Washington Post foreign policy dot com herots they're all reporting that
[01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:26.640]  Obama may hit Iran ABC News said this last week because of al-Qaeda now again
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:30.560]  ladies and gentlemen al-Qaeda is based in Saudi Arabia 15 of the 19 hijackers
[01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:35.400]  that's not debated the groups they've used to attack Libya now Syria are al-Qaeda
[01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:41.680]  based and Wahhabist based affiliated jihadis 80% of Islamist Sunni about 10%
[01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:46.880]  of that is is Wahhabist and that's what al-Qaeda comes out of and the West is
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:52.920]  backing al-Qaeda to attack Syria and Libya and Iran it is unbelievable that
[01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:57.040]  they get up on the news and say they've got to attack Iran because they're al-Qaeda
[01:09:57.040 --> 01:10:00.960]  that Hillary said that last week that's the new talking point have you put that
[01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:05.760]  up guys I think it's Washington Post Hillary says Iran backing al-Qaeda when
[01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:09.360]  when NATO runs al-Qaeda and Turkey's now shelling him now
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:14.760]  pastor Lindsay Williams 30 years ago or more he worked on the trans Alaska
[01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:20.120]  pipeline his best-selling book energy non-crisis has been proven 30 plus years
[01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:24.080]  later to be totally accurate and it was underground best-seller I remember
[01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:29.760]  hearing about it in the 90s I had family that read it in the 80s and because of
[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:33.360]  his book we also knew some of these men he was kind of the corporate liaison
[01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:37.520]  from the oil company boards where they all get together and collude to the oil
[01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:41.960]  field workers for several years well no three years and the point is is that he
[01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:46.440]  knew I don't even want to say the name of the guy that's dead because I was
[01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:52.080]  mixing up with the guy that's still alive but mr. Fromm died a year and a
[01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:56.400]  half ago or so of cancer so we can reveal that fellow Lindsay Williams of
[01:10:56.400 --> 01:11:01.160]  course his sources have also been backed up people like dr. Stan Monteef
[01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:06.480]  syndicated radio host dr. Monteef who's on the air here on Genesis he he found
[01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:09.600]  out who they were and actually called them both the other guy that's still
[01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:15.000]  alive was a CEO of a big three oil company I'll just leave it at that but
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:19.160]  everything we've gotten from him has has been on the battle plans sometimes the
[01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:24.840]  globalist change plans but I'd say about 95% of what Lindsay Williams has told us
[01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:30.280]  in the last six years that you know oil would go from where it was at 50 bucks to
[01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:34.920]  150 then he said okay now we'll go to 40 he was wrong it went below 40 but
[01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:38.720]  everybody laughed at me said that's not gonna happen he said two years ago and
[01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:41.360]  I don't even have the crew or staff to go pull these up they're there on the
[01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:45.080]  Alex Jones channel that's there in the archives he said and we wrote articles
[01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:49.520]  about it he said two years ago the Middle East gonna go up in flames they're
[01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:53.040]  gonna stage revolution they're gonna turn they're gonna fund the radicals and
[01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:58.200]  even I'm like wow that sounds wild but that's a diversion they're gonna attack
[01:11:58.200 --> 01:12:03.200]  you know next is China watch China well since then they've massed the fleets the
[01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:09.480]  Chinese president the Chinese top general and the Chinese top Admiral have
[01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:13.560]  all said in the last year prepare for war just type in Chinese presidents has
[01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:17.920]  prepared for war with the US Chinese top general super before with the US the
[01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:22.160]  Chinese top Admiral prepare for the US that's because the so-called US run by
[01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:27.120]  foreign banks is setting up bases all around China they've got the Japanese
[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:32.280]  trying to stir stuff up with the Chinese as a pretext while China holds our debt
[01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:36.000]  and while the globalists are trying to move everything to China as the new
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:40.440]  command base it's all this balancing act with the bankers playing countries off
[01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:44.720]  against each other to make the country's acquiesce to what the bankers want but
[01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:49.920]  in the end hurting and destroying the sovereign nations in the endgame ship to
[01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:53.800]  see it from that perspective of playing both sides off against each other the old
[01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:58.800]  Rothschild model now Lindsay Lindsay's always such a gentleman he comes on and
[01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:03.600]  thanks me and kind of recaps things and and and but but you know need to do that
[01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:10.320]  Lindsay just getting into this you said over a year ago hey don't worry gas is
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:15.960]  gonna stay low until 2012 but by the end of 2012 the dollar will be dead and you
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:21.160]  said two years ago QE3 will not come in 2011 he goes Alex I know you're the voice
[01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:25.000]  of said this off air but he mentioned it somewhat on air he was polite didn't
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:28.320]  say my name you know we hear these natural ads saying it's gonna happen this
[01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:34.760]  December that was last year no it's not QE will be announced in the middle of
[01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:39.920]  2012 he said that a year ago boom it happened so I'm hoping you're wrong
[01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:43.920]  Max Kaiser eyes right most the time you know he's been wrong about things before
[01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:48.040]  saying silver go to 500 they pulled some tricks and drove it back down when it
[01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:51.560]  got up to 50 but I'm hoping you're wrong bud because and I hope your big oil
[01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:55.320]  company exact friend is wrong because you know tell us what you've been right
[01:13:55.320 --> 01:14:02.280]  about briefly and then get into what's coming next because I wish I wish that
[01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:05.440]  you you had a better track record of being wrong
[01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:14.440]  Pastor Lindsey Williams a lensy go ahead what a privilege it is to be with you on info wars today Alex and to
[01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:20.560]  you the information that I've been given in briefings from my elite friend just
[01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:26.960]  recently it was so exciting last week I knew in advance that mr. Obama was
[01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:33.680]  gonna utterly gloriously mess up in his debate I had received a email that
[01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:37.520]  morning from my elite friend and they told me basically what was going to
[01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:42.080]  happen that night you know things like so he was told to throw the fight he was
[01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:46.080]  told to throw the fight well yeah we're getting into that in the course of the
[01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:51.000]  program today and also the expression I have used that they gave to me for the
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:55.680]  past maybe year and a half the dollar we've been in by the end of 2012 I was
[01:14:55.680 --> 01:15:02.400]  just given the 13 reasons or 12 reasons just recently to watch and but Alex the
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:08.520]  most important thing right now is the most a dastardly act that has ever been
[01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:13.440]  performed on the American people in the history of our country that took place on
[01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:20.160]  September the 13th 2012 this is going to affect the life to dinner table and the
[01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:23.920]  home of every single person out there you're listening audience any more than
[01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:28.560]  any other one thing now all of you heard it it was on the national news the
[01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:33.000]  Federal Reserve Mr. Ben Bernanke announced that they will purchase 40
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:39.000]  billion dollars in mortgage-backed securities each month indefinitely well
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:43.240]  as soon as I heard that Alex immediately I said something's wrong
[01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:47.400]  somewhere we are not we're not hearing the whole story we don't know what's
[01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:51.640]  really going on I picked up the phone the very following day if I remember
[01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:55.680]  correctly and I call the gentleman you know his name you just referred to him
[01:15:55.680 --> 01:16:00.920]  a moment ago I picked up the telephone and I call my elite friend and I said
[01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:05.640]  what's the real story behind all of this now if you get a pencil and piece of
[01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:09.360]  paper everybody out there in the listening audience you will not see this
[01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:13.640]  in the financial newsletters for two another two to three months and if I had
[01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:17.360]  not picked up that phone that next day and call my elite friend I would not
[01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:22.760]  know you about to hear something that only one newsletter is even animated to
[01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:27.920]  it I've seen lately of all the ones that I look at so here it is I asked him the
[01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:34.560]  question I said where will the Federal Reserve get 30 billion dollars every
[01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:40.440]  month September October November December January indefinitely right on and he
[01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:45.720]  said immediately without any hesitation whatsoever he said Chaplin in
[01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:52.000]  air I said wait a minute you're telling me that the QE one was always 70 billion
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:56.760]  and here this thing didn't even call this QE three they just merely said they
[01:16:56.760 --> 01:17:00.960]  were going to send this so much worse than QE three could have ever dared to
[01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:05.400]  be you can't imagine even though they didn't call it that where will they get
[01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:11.520]  $20 billion thin air and I said okay they're going to buy mortgage back
[01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:17.160]  securities with something that they pulled out of thin air that has no
[01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:21.160]  backing whatsoever I said this country's in shambles we got 16 trillion
[01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:26.280]  dollar national debt the housing market has completely burst people are
[01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:30.400]  wondering how they even gonna feed their families and you telling me that they're
[01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:34.260]  going to take 40 billion dollars out of thin air versus mortgage back
[01:17:34.260 --> 01:17:38.600]  securities okay turn this word around so you will know what a mortgage back

[01:21:57.200 --> 01:22:01.080]  yeah just last week I was sitting around thinking about Pastor Lindsey
[01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:05.600]  Williams I'm like two years ago he said the Middle East would go up in flames
[01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:10.840]  he said every country would fall he went down the list and then he said
[01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:15.640]  Saudi Arabia would fall too and he said yeah there'll probably be something with
[01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:21.400]  Iran but that's a diversion his source who I know who's tied in at the highest
[01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:28.320]  levels who's just turned out to be frighteningly accurate said that that
[01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:31.880]  China is the real target and I mean I don't know what the globalists are
[01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:35.080]  thinking of they're gonna start a war with them when our own government help
[01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:38.640]  give them the missile secrets so that instead of one warhead coming into our
[01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:43.200]  atmosphere it's 25 of them or half of them are warheads half of them are
[01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:49.920]  dummies decoys that's the basic reentry nerve technology I'm digressing
[01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:54.600]  Lindsey where to start here then we've got you 20 minutes of the next hour and
[01:22:54.600 --> 01:23:02.520]  I want to take some calls as well break down what your source says they're
[01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:06.240]  planning to do what they're gonna do with this quantitative easing where
[01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:11.880]  that's going what they're gonna do with the the derivatives crud the the bad
[01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:15.880]  mortgages they sold where all this is going I guess if China doesn't accept
[01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:18.840]  the trillions in that they've bought they're gonna get attacked I mean this
[01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:25.200]  is just madness well the providence of God I had the privilege of being invited
[01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:28.920]  to be the chaplain to the elite of the world for a three-year period these
[01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:33.480]  people are now in their 70s and 80s they have given me numerous briefings
[01:23:33.480 --> 01:23:39.840]  recently as to what they intend to leave and tend to do I'd like to answer all of
[01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:44.080]  your questions today if I can Alex because they have told me recently all
[01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:48.160]  of the things that you've just mentioned but the most bastardly one of all
[01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:53.800]  was perpetrated on America on September the 13th 2012 so if I'll allow me I'll
[01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:58.360]  go through it as fast as I possibly can my elite friends a chaplain they going
[01:23:58.360 --> 01:24:05.600]  to pull $40 billion out of thin air every month indefinitely and I said okay
[01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:09.320]  they're gonna buy mortgage-backed securities let me break it down this
[01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:13.920]  way in order to do it quickly that's your house you heard me correctly the
[01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:18.800]  shopping center down the street the small business that used real estate as a
[01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:23.600]  method of obtaining their loan and I said you mean to tell me that the Federal
[01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:29.000]  Reserve bought your house if it's mortgaged they bought your house last
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:34.400]  month that's exactly right and I said you telling me that a person works hard
[01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:40.320]  in order to try to make that payment 30 hours a week slaves laborers but yet
[01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:44.800]  the Federal Reserve went and bought that house mortgage and pulled out of thin
[01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:51.000]  air with no labor whatsoever he said chaplain that's correct $30 billion
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:55.160]  every month indefinitely then the statement you ready I ask you to get

[01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:16.400]  you know I have a lot of high-powered sources as well I'll be honest with you
[01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:21.560]  that over the years as it's been made public that the NSA is listing everybody's
[01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:26.160]  phone calls and that government people are being persecuted for whistleblowing
[01:31:26.160 --> 01:31:32.280]  a lot of my sources will not talk to me over the telephone anymore even in code
[01:31:32.280 --> 01:31:36.040]  that's another question for Lindsay Williams how is his source still able to
[01:31:36.040 --> 01:31:40.280]  talk to him why is the elite allowing us because I know who this guy is and I
[01:31:40.280 --> 01:31:44.440]  know another journalist that years ago called both his sources up and said is
[01:31:44.440 --> 01:31:48.000]  it true you're telling Lindsay Williams this they're like how in the dickens did
[01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:52.720]  you get my number how did you find out who we are and one of them since died we
[01:31:52.720 --> 01:31:59.120]  can talk about it mr. Fromm who was what the head of operations at one of the
[01:31:59.120 --> 01:32:03.560]  big three oil companies the other was the former CEO of one of the biggest in
[01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:10.080]  the world I have some similar sources and they basically say the same thing or
[01:32:10.080 --> 01:32:15.840]  or they say things like your show is going to get real big and I'm like why
[01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:21.560]  because you're you're on target bud what does that mean just you're on target
[01:32:21.560 --> 01:32:26.800]  I've been told that by multi-time billionaires defense contractor company
[01:32:26.800 --> 01:32:33.040]  owners oil company executives high-level I mean I get current generals
[01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:38.400]  calling me up famous spies call me up authors I'm not bragging I mean if you
[01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:43.720]  are somebody who's in the establishment who is there to talk to there aren't
[01:32:43.720 --> 01:32:49.880]  many people and also I'm known for never giving up sources that's another big
[01:32:49.880 --> 01:32:54.080]  part of people are always like give us your source that's a lot that's hilarious
[01:32:54.080 --> 01:32:57.720]  that shows the person knows nothing about journalism because I wear the hat of
[01:32:57.720 --> 01:33:01.960]  a commentator I give my analysis I ran I rave but I behind the scenes when we're
[01:33:01.960 --> 01:33:05.520]  writing articles we're doing stories we're vetting things does it mean we're
[01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:09.760]  perfect no does it mean we make mistakes yes but we're trying to tell the truth
[01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:17.400]  that's difference between us and MSNBC and people like that and now more than
[01:33:17.400 --> 01:33:21.080]  ever I want to tell you something that Lindsey said before we've been able to
[01:33:21.080 --> 01:33:24.320]  have them change their timeline before and the big number sense key just
[01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:27.520]  published a book this year admitting the leader in trouble and people are
[01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:32.160]  waking up and and that they may have to change their timeline but the big banks
[01:33:32.160 --> 01:33:37.080]  have committed to this takeover and so now a lot of analysts think they can't
[01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:40.760]  reverse what they've begun and when Lindsey just said that his source told
[01:33:40.760 --> 01:33:44.440]  him all this it clicks with everything we've got because if you look the
[01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:52.000]  derivatives market the last four years since 2008 got smaller for just a
[01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:55.200]  little while and now in the last year you've seen the derivatives market
[01:33:55.200 --> 01:33:59.480]  getting bigger again and they won't say what they're doing with the 45 billion a
[01:33:59.480 --> 01:34:03.160]  month there's another 40 billion on top of that that goes to other things but
[01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:07.680]  the media focuses on the 45 billion to you know these mortgage-backed
[01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:12.880]  securities and the banks have always been doing what Lindsey's saying since
[01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:17.480]  they got rid of Glass-Steagall in 1999 1998 they have been leveraging your
[01:34:17.480 --> 01:34:21.640]  mortgage like a fractional reserve when a bank has a dollar can loan out $10
[01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:25.400]  they've been taking your mortgage and loaning it out in some cases 50 times
[01:34:25.400 --> 01:34:29.200]  that's what these derivatives are they give them all these fancy confusing
[01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:34.120]  names they're fraud and they've got Iceland they've got Greece they've got
[01:34:34.120 --> 01:34:39.600]  Spain they've got Portugal they've got the US shining on to this so that's what
[01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:42.080]  Lindsey's getting at now I'm gonna go back to Lindsey here in a moment but I
[01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:48.720]  want to point out our inaugural issue and we've still got we've got about 600

[01:36:47.960 --> 01:36:52.400]  end up shutting down we are operating not on the margins with a little bit of
[01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:57.360]  a backup do the math if it's six million dollars year to run this place what it

[01:37:27.240 --> 01:37:30.600]  of it because Michael Savage has left radio for a while but we were already
[01:37:30.600 --> 01:37:35.040]  getting a bunch perfect storms happening cover a talkers magazine last year
[01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:39.920]  stations were on getting top ratings out of nowhere because of the new people
[01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:44.760]  meter tracker systems are better at ratings in the old systems the show is
[01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:50.120]  on fire right as the evil explodes good is exploding for every action equal or
[01:37:50.120 --> 01:37:55.280]  opposite reaction so my point is now more than ever support us go to info
[01:37:55.280 --> 01:37:58.520]  wars money bomb calm and donate today because we usually start promoting a
[01:37:58.520 --> 01:38:01.440]  month out and usually have about a hundred thousand dollars by the time it
[01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:05.520]  starts I've been so busy I'm I started promoting this stuff today or last night
[01:38:05.520 --> 01:38:11.320]  10 days out it's the 18th and 19th 48 hour transmission I'll be here for most
[01:38:11.320 --> 01:38:16.280]  of it so again I'm done ranting going back to our guests we've got for 20
[01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:20.080]  minutes the next hour we'll also go to your calls as well Lindsay I'm here
[01:38:20.080 --> 01:38:24.280]  ranting it's just that as everything we talk about unfortunately starts to
[01:38:24.280 --> 01:38:29.760]  unfold as our credibility rises we're in a depression we need the support to be
[01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:35.000]  able to continue to be a platform for everybody from you to Ron Paul did you
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:40.120]  know to Jesse Ventura all the activists we have on the responsibility I don't
[01:38:40.120 --> 01:38:44.160]  know if you're a pastor I'll ask you a lot of people get power and they get
[01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:48.600]  arrogant and they get reckless with me it's the opposite I'm not scared but I'm
[01:38:48.600 --> 01:38:53.480]  also humble I know I come off as aggressive and that's because I'm
[01:38:53.480 --> 01:38:59.240]  angry but as I know now that I'm exponentially growing a lot of people
[01:38:59.240 --> 01:39:03.320]  call it choking I'm not choking it's the opposite I kind of just run through the
[01:39:03.320 --> 01:39:07.800]  show like it's nothing and then I think back I'd better do a better job because
[01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:12.880]  of where God has put me in his plan I don't know how to deal with this that
[01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:17.720]  it's 15 million a week now at current growth rates it's going to be 20 30
[01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:21.560]  million a week I mean this is insane I can't believe I'm talking about this
[01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:25.200]  as far as the show Lindsay that I've been put in this position how do you deal
[01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:28.440]  with the fact that you were put in the position to be brought in to a inner
[01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:33.000]  boardroom meeting of oil companies for three years same way you're doing right
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:36.880]  now Alex I consider the honor and a privilege that God would have even
[01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:41.720]  allowed me the opportunity a little insignificant unknown missionary out in
[01:39:41.720 --> 01:39:45.760]  the bush of Alaska to sit with the elite of the world for three years you Alex
[01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:51.480]  have been given a anointing of God and you are in the right place at the right
[01:39:51.480 --> 01:39:55.720]  time exactly what God wants you to do and that's the reason you're there and
[01:39:55.720 --> 01:40:00.360]  both of us do it with all the humility imaginable in order to try to tell
[01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:05.480]  people the truth and Alex I hope we get time in the program today because you
[01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:09.920]  saw it everybody saw that presidential debate last week on yeah start over

[01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:24.000]  America and federalize them just like they've said they're going to do with
[01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:27.760]  all the industry and then only the insiders will be able to operate my dad

[01:42:19.120 --> 01:42:24.600]  closed doors he said the agreement was made long before Mr. Bernanke ever made
[01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:28.560]  his announcement that they would buy these mortgage-backed securities from
[01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:34.080]  the banks and he said that money the 40 billion that the lending institutions
[01:42:34.080 --> 01:42:39.560]  are going to receive it has been previously guaranteed by them that they
[01:42:39.560 --> 01:42:45.160]  will turn around and buy treasure is with it now you haven't heard this
[01:42:45.160 --> 01:42:51.800]  anywhere only he could have possibly had known it I said wait a minute you need

[01:43:20.560 --> 01:43:26.400]  billion out of Benair which depreciates the value of your currency and in turn
[01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:31.240]  they're going to have a previous behind closed doors agreement that these
[01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:35.960]  lending institutions will buy treasurers which pays the interest on the national
[01:43:35.960 --> 01:43:41.160]  debt in order to maintain the American dollar for a few more months until they
[01:43:41.160 --> 01:43:46.360]  are ready to collapse all of the currencies of the world okay I don't

[01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:59.400]  audience my elite friend I in the co-actory got through that I was so
[01:43:59.400 --> 01:44:05.240]  stunned I was literally speechless and I said okay tell me a few other things and
[01:44:05.240 --> 01:44:09.560]  I began to just talk to him one-on-one you want to know what the elite learned
[01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:14.840]  out of Thursday September the 13th 2012 now he definitely won't get this from
[01:44:14.840 --> 01:44:19.720]  any other source whatsoever he said chaplain basically what we've learned
[01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:25.360]  is that the American people will give in they're not going to protest he said
[01:44:25.360 --> 01:44:28.600]  we're not going to have any revolution he said they're not going to be any
[01:44:28.600 --> 01:44:33.200]  routes in the street I'm gonna put it my words because I want to shame you every
[01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:38.240]  person out there you're gonna belly up the elite are expecting you now to
[01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:44.600]  become slaves and your children and your grandchildren when nobody rose up and in
[01:44:44.600 --> 01:44:49.840]  arms about 40 billion dollars out of thin air being to admit your house being
[01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:54.480]  invested in the derivative market a Chinaman may own it a Russian may own
[01:44:54.480 --> 01:44:59.480]  your house and and then you did nothing about it and now there will be no
[01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:05.480]  improvement in the economy because those scoundrels who call themselves the
[01:45:05.480 --> 01:45:10.840]  lending institutions will now a pre-par agreement turnaround and by
[01:45:10.840 --> 01:45:17.200]  treasurers T bills in order to keep the American economy afloat and the elite
[01:45:17.200 --> 01:45:21.040]  had learned something about Americans they have learned that the Americans
[01:45:21.040 --> 01:45:24.120]  aren't going to do anything not want to give you the facts you go back and look
[01:45:24.120 --> 01:45:29.200]  this up for yourself last week write it down please on Thursday September the
[01:45:29.200 --> 01:45:34.400]  13th instantaneously upon the announcement of Ben Bernanke as to the
[01:45:34.400 --> 01:45:37.840]  fact that the Federal Reserve was going about 30 billion dollars worth of
[01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:41.760]  mortgage-backed securities instantaneously that moment gold went up
[01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:49.600]  $49 just like that that's 3% silver went up $3 that's 9% gasoline went up 15
[01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:55.320]  cents instantaneously at the gas pump that's 4% now wait a minute
[01:45:55.320 --> 01:45:59.280]  wait a minute I know what you're gonna say as soon as I say this next statement
[01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:05.480]  gasoline did not go up 15 cents folks are you catching this please you must
[01:46:05.480 --> 01:46:10.440]  understand this you've got to think this through gasoline is 4 quarts to the
[01:46:10.440 --> 01:46:14.600]  gallon when mr. Bernanke made that statement you went to the gas pump and
[01:46:14.600 --> 01:46:21.520]  it was 15 cents higher no it wasn't it was not gasoline is still 4 quarts to
[01:46:21.520 --> 01:46:26.480]  the gallon the currency that you purchased that gasoline would have lost
[01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:30.600]  in its purchasing but you wonder why I made the statement why my elite told me
[01:46:30.600 --> 01:46:34.520]  back a year and a half ago the dollar would be dead by the end of 2012 you
[01:46:34.520 --> 01:46:37.880]  understand anything yet I only told you a fraction of what the briefings are
[01:46:37.880 --> 01:46:43.720]  they've given me recently that dollar went down 15 cents in purchasing power
[01:46:43.720 --> 01:46:49.360]  instantaneously upon mr. Bernanke's announcement the gasoline is still 4
[01:46:49.360 --> 01:46:53.400]  quarts to the gallon and didn't go up sure the point is the media lies and says
[01:46:53.400 --> 01:46:58.360]  it's only speculators driving up the price of oil driving up the price of
[01:46:58.360 --> 01:47:04.960]  food no it's dollar devaluation it happened the day they did it the dollar
[01:47:04.960 --> 01:47:09.760]  lost its purchasing power instantaneously upon that very moment now you
[01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:14.720]  think about the groceries I have a question for you oh my goodness folks
[01:47:14.720 --> 01:47:20.720]  they're going up 10% a month every month in the last six months
[01:47:20.720 --> 01:47:25.540]  thanks are you catching this your house mortgage was used to invest in the
[01:47:25.540 --> 01:47:31.200]  Las Vegas one-on-bend it secondly the institutions that you have placed trust
[01:47:31.200 --> 01:47:36.400]  in the banks that you have your money in are not going to help the economy they
[01:47:36.400 --> 01:47:40.840]  are going to turn around and buy T bills to bail out the Federal Reserve and
[01:47:40.840 --> 01:47:43.920]  keep them afloat just long enough until they're ready for the collapse that they
[01:47:43.920 --> 01:47:47.920]  place the elite have learned that you aren't going to do anything about it
[01:47:47.920 --> 01:47:54.360]  whatsoever and where I got a question for you how long before you cannot afford
[01:47:54.360 --> 01:47:58.200]  to make your movies your payment any longer that watch this I like
[01:47:58.200 --> 01:48:02.200]  avocados I try to eat an avocado sandwich every few days some reason I

[01:48:14.960 --> 01:48:18.440]  be before you can no longer afford to put the clothes on the back of your

[01:48:23.920 --> 01:48:28.240]  mortgage payment and it's all engineered by the bankers that the
[01:48:28.240 --> 01:48:34.440]  prostitute collaborator media tell us are fixing everything and they are
[01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:41.160]  every month monetizing 40 plus billion of their debt backed by our mortgages and
[01:48:41.160 --> 01:48:46.040]  then leveraging it again into the very derivatives that we're bailing out
[01:48:46.040 --> 01:48:51.200]  Ponzi schemes on top of Ponzi schemes on top of Ponzi's the worst drought in 50
[01:48:51.200 --> 01:48:55.240]  years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on

[01:52:22.040 --> 01:52:26.040]  Folks, you better be asking yourselves, who are you?
[01:52:26.040 --> 01:52:30.040]  Okay, Lindsey, I've got to have him back up again later in the week or next week because
[01:52:30.040 --> 01:52:35.040]  he is on fire with the info he's giving us and I know who his former Big Three Oil
[01:52:35.040 --> 01:52:38.040]  Company CEO, I know of who he speaks.
[01:52:38.040 --> 01:52:41.040]  Lindsey, just briefly, why is he telling you all this?
[01:52:41.040 --> 01:52:46.040]  I know before you got threatened, they said they'd basically kill you a few years ago.
[01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:49.040]  They didn't shut up, but here's what you're allowed to say.
[01:52:49.040 --> 01:52:54.040]  I mean, isn't that metaphysical rule that they want people to know?
[01:52:54.040 --> 01:53:00.040]  I know the other guy was dying of cancer, took him a few years, and so he was morally against
[01:53:00.040 --> 01:53:01.040]  what's happening.
[01:53:01.040 --> 01:53:04.040]  The other guy's been threatening you, but still acting friendly.
[01:53:04.040 --> 01:53:07.040]  And if people don't get that, I've actually experienced similar things with these people.
[01:53:07.040 --> 01:53:11.040]  Very, very weird people, but it's like a breed or something.
[01:53:11.040 --> 01:53:12.040]  We all act the same.
[01:53:12.040 --> 01:53:16.040]  Just briefly, because I don't want to get into the China situation.
[01:53:16.040 --> 01:53:19.040]  If you called it two years ago, what would happen in the Middle East?
[01:53:19.040 --> 01:53:22.040]  But you said that's a diversion ahead of China.
[01:53:22.040 --> 01:53:23.040]  And everybody's like, China.
[01:53:23.040 --> 01:53:25.040]  And since then, the fleets are masked.
[01:53:25.040 --> 01:53:27.040]  The Chinese generals are saying, prepare for war.
[01:53:27.040 --> 01:53:29.040]  Answer those two questions.
[01:53:29.040 --> 01:53:30.040]  Why is he telling you this?
[01:53:30.040 --> 01:53:33.040]  I mean, have you asked him, why are you telling me this?
[01:53:33.040 --> 01:53:39.040]  Number one, he's telling me this because out of courtesy, and should I say admiration
[01:53:39.040 --> 01:53:44.040]  for the fact that I gave three years of my life to be there, chaplain, and I'm probably
[01:53:44.040 --> 01:53:49.040]  the only person of my type that most of these people ever came in touch with in their life.
[01:53:49.040 --> 01:53:51.040]  Secondly, this man is older.
[01:53:51.040 --> 01:53:54.040]  You remember Mr. Fromm was 87 years old when he died.
[01:53:54.040 --> 01:53:56.040]  This gentleman is in his 70s.
[01:53:56.040 --> 01:53:58.040]  He's facing the graveyard.
[01:53:58.040 --> 01:54:03.040]  And whenever you get, you know, you're much younger than I am, Alex.
[01:54:03.040 --> 01:54:07.040]  You're a young Sprott chicken compared to me and Dr. Sam Monteith.
[01:54:07.040 --> 01:54:13.040]  But you know, when you get a little older and you know that nobody's going to live out there forever,
[01:54:13.040 --> 01:54:14.040]  you start talking.
[01:54:14.040 --> 01:54:16.040]  And this man is doing exactly that.
[01:54:16.040 --> 01:54:21.040]  Number one, out of admiration, number two, because he, and then two, he has children
[01:54:21.040 --> 01:54:23.040]  and they haven't threatened him yet.
[01:54:23.040 --> 01:54:28.040]  So as a result, he keeps giving me information, so I just hope he keeps giving it for a long time.
[01:54:28.040 --> 01:54:30.040]  But you know, it's so interesting, Alex.
[01:54:30.040 --> 01:54:31.040]  I got to cover this quick.
[01:54:31.040 --> 01:54:34.040]  You know, I know we're giving out a time here, but I wish I had two or three hours.
[01:54:34.040 --> 01:54:37.040]  This was so comical.
[01:54:37.040 --> 01:54:39.040]  I mean, literally comical.
[01:54:39.040 --> 01:54:40.040]  You'll appreciate this.
[01:54:40.040 --> 01:54:43.040]  Last week was the presidential debate.
[01:54:43.040 --> 01:54:46.040]  Wednesday, October 3, 2012.
[01:54:46.040 --> 01:54:50.040]  And that morning, before the debate took place that night,
[01:54:50.040 --> 01:54:57.040]  I received an email from my elite friend and he briefed me on what was going to happen that night.
[01:54:57.040 --> 01:55:00.040]  Now, this is so comical until I'm going to put a little comical note.
[01:55:00.040 --> 01:55:02.040]  Yeah, tell folks real fast. Tell them.
[01:55:02.040 --> 01:55:08.040]  Yeah, I'll cover the rest of this mortgage-backed security thing on another day when you let me back on the air.
[01:55:08.040 --> 01:55:13.040]  But first of all, I received this email that morning and it basically said,
[01:55:13.040 --> 01:55:17.040]  watch for certain things in the course of the debate.
[01:55:17.040 --> 01:55:22.040]  Now, remember, Obama had double-crossed the elite.
[01:55:22.040 --> 01:55:27.040]  I told you this back down to six, eight, seven, eight months ago and many of you didn't believe it.
[01:55:27.040 --> 01:55:32.040]  But my elite friends had told me how that numerous times Obama had double-crossed him.
[01:55:32.040 --> 01:55:37.040]  Obama was like a little child that had been caught with his hand in the cookie jar.
[01:55:37.040 --> 01:55:38.040]  You saw him.
[01:55:38.040 --> 01:55:44.040]  I mean, this man that has all of the charisma imaginable, he mesmerizes his audience.
[01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:47.040]  He could hypnotize an audience.
[01:55:47.040 --> 01:55:49.040]  He was a deer in the headlights.
[01:55:49.040 --> 01:55:55.040]  And all of a sudden, he is sitting there like a child with his hand in the cookie jar.
[01:55:55.040 --> 01:56:00.040]  And I want to tell you something, folks. He was actually scared stiff.
[01:56:00.040 --> 01:56:04.040]  That's the reason he did what he did in this debate last night. Why?
[01:56:04.040 --> 01:56:13.040]  His disobedience, his disorientation, his speechless way in that thing was a result of what I had been told.
[01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:19.040]  The elite literally slapped Mr. Obama in the face last weekend, scared the living daylights out of him.
[01:56:19.040 --> 01:56:21.040]  I will name three things.
[01:56:21.040 --> 01:56:26.040]  The three ways in which Obama in the past year has double-crossed the elite.
[01:56:26.040 --> 01:56:28.040]  Stay there back in 60 seconds.

[01:58:32.040 --> 01:58:37.040]  And I know we've got callers lined up for quick questions for him.
[01:58:37.040 --> 01:58:39.040]  Lindsay, finish up your Obama story.
[01:58:39.040 --> 01:58:42.040]  I mean, he did look like he was cowed.
[01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:47.040]  That's actually what I said last week is that he appeared intimidated by Romney.
[01:58:47.040 --> 01:58:50.040]  And I chalked it up to arrogance.
[01:58:50.040 --> 01:58:56.040]  He used to everybody groveling to him for four years to have a corporate vampire like Romney on him.
[01:58:56.040 --> 01:58:59.040]  A charming vampire as my wife calls him.
[01:58:59.040 --> 01:59:03.040]  He couldn't handle it, but I know your source says that Obama's been double-crossing him.
[01:59:03.040 --> 01:59:06.040]  How has he been double-crossing him?
[01:59:06.040 --> 01:59:10.040]  Well, the word that you used, Alex, intimidated, is the understatement of the year.
[01:59:10.040 --> 01:59:16.040]  Obama was literally scared stiff while he was on that platform because of what was said.
[01:59:16.040 --> 01:59:19.040]  And I'm going to, all throughout that now, I have those country paper ready.
[01:59:19.040 --> 01:59:25.040]  I'm going to list the three items that literally scared Mr. Obama into losing his place,
[01:59:25.040 --> 01:59:30.040]  being completely out of order, and not being able to keep himself.
[01:59:30.040 --> 01:59:32.040]  You know, Alex, it's been, let's see.
[01:59:32.040 --> 01:59:36.040]  The last time I had a privilege of being on your show was March the 25th.
[01:59:36.040 --> 01:59:38.040]  I looked it up in the calendar here a moment ago.
[01:59:38.040 --> 01:59:42.040]  And since so many briefings these people have given me since then,
[01:59:42.040 --> 01:59:44.040]  I just have so much to tell your people.
[01:59:44.040 --> 01:59:46.040]  You bear with me.
[01:59:46.040 --> 01:59:48.040]  There's so much I'd like to say.
[01:59:48.040 --> 01:59:51.040]  Anyway, number one, two, and three, here they are.
[01:59:51.040 --> 01:59:55.040]  Do you remember back when the cross-accounted pipeline was canceled?
[01:59:55.040 --> 01:59:58.040]  I was in touch with my elite friend just after that.
[01:59:58.040 --> 02:00:00.040]  And he was livid.
[02:00:00.040 --> 02:00:03.040]  He was so mad at what this man had done.
[02:00:03.040 --> 02:00:07.040]  And then it was only a few weeks after that that he said to me, he said,
[02:00:07.040 --> 02:00:12.040]  Chaplin, if we older, now please, distinguish between the two.
[02:00:12.040 --> 02:00:15.040]  I know the men who are in their 70s and 80s.
[02:00:15.040 --> 02:00:19.040]  And by the way, I've been put in touch with some more here recently, Alex,
[02:00:19.040 --> 02:00:22.040]  but not just the one you know now.
[02:00:22.040 --> 02:00:25.040]  There's some others that are talking to who are in their 70s and 80s.
[02:00:25.040 --> 02:00:28.040]  Now, the younger elite have a little bit different slant on things.
[02:00:28.040 --> 02:00:32.040]  The older elite, if they have anything to do with it whatsoever,
[02:00:32.040 --> 02:00:34.040]  folks that please catch this,
[02:00:34.040 --> 02:00:37.040]  if the older elite have anything to do with it,
[02:00:37.040 --> 02:00:41.040]  Mr. Obama will not become the next president of the United States of America.
[02:00:41.040 --> 02:00:46.040]  He canceled out on the cross-counted pipeline and literally made enemies out of all of number two.
[02:00:46.040 --> 02:00:50.040]  Now, go back, please, I want you to go back and listen to that presidential debate last week.
[02:00:50.040 --> 02:00:52.040]  Sure, so he did that.
[02:00:52.040 --> 02:00:54.040]  At the time, you didn't even know what you were hearing.
[02:00:54.040 --> 02:00:56.040]  But I knew what was going to be said.
[02:00:56.040 --> 02:01:04.040]  You remember the expression that Mr. Romney made about Dodd's Frank Bill.
[02:01:04.040 --> 02:01:08.040]  Please, you cannot imagine how important that is to the elite.
[02:01:08.040 --> 02:01:14.040]  Obama had helped to double-cross them into Dodd's Frank Bill.
[02:01:14.040 --> 02:01:16.040]  You've got to go back and look this up.
[02:01:16.040 --> 02:01:22.040]  Number three, you notice that Mr. Romney talked about production of American oil
[02:01:22.040 --> 02:01:27.040]  and how that Obama would not allow that to take place in many oil pools in America.
[02:01:27.040 --> 02:01:33.040]  Now, this is so significant because when they create the mass chaos that they're creating in the Middle East,
[02:01:33.040 --> 02:01:39.040]  they must be able to come back to America at $150 a barrel for crude oil
[02:01:39.040 --> 02:01:45.040]  and produce it from these very fields that Mr. Obama would not let them go through with instituting
[02:01:45.040 --> 02:01:47.040]  during his last four years.
[02:01:47.040 --> 02:01:55.040]  And as a result, the elite are so angry over this until Romney literally scared Mr. Obama stiff.
[02:01:55.040 --> 02:01:56.040]  Yeah, that's why he was freaked out.
[02:01:56.040 --> 02:02:00.040]  You even said that on Six Months ago that they were mad over the pipeline
[02:02:00.040 --> 02:02:02.040]  and mad over those other issues.
[02:02:02.040 --> 02:02:03.040]  And that was the thing.
[02:02:03.040 --> 02:02:06.040]  Romney was there delivering Obama a message.
[02:02:06.040 --> 02:02:10.040]  Oh, he sure was. He was telling him things that literally scared him stiff.
[02:02:10.040 --> 02:02:11.040]  Not really.
[02:02:11.040 --> 02:02:13.040]  Well, I mean, because Obama knew.
[02:02:13.040 --> 02:02:18.040]  This is an amazing analysis that these are messages he'd already been given to the grapevine
[02:02:18.040 --> 02:02:23.040]  and here's Romney aggressively staring him down the whole time telling him stuff
[02:02:23.040 --> 02:02:26.040]  and saying, listen, my sons lie too.
[02:02:26.040 --> 02:02:29.040]  Calling him son. Did you see that?
[02:02:29.040 --> 02:02:31.040]  It's just amazing.
[02:02:31.040 --> 02:02:34.040]  Well, I really concur with what your source is saying.
[02:02:34.040 --> 02:02:37.040]  Amazing. Well, here's the $64 billion question.
[02:02:37.040 --> 02:02:41.040]  Why would Obama, who's bought and paid for by the globalist, be going against him?
[02:02:41.040 --> 02:02:44.040]  I think you're saying there's a fissure in the elite.
[02:02:44.040 --> 02:02:50.040]  Let's look at that and take phone calls straight ahead with Lindsey Williams.
[02:02:50.040 --> 02:02:53.040]  Cold and flu season is upon us.
[02:02:53.040 --> 02:02:59.040]  Protect yourself with supernatural silver, a revolutionary new broad spectrum antibacterial.
[02:02:59.040 --> 02:03:05.040]  Recent advances in silver technology have resulted in a silver solution that can be used daily to prevent bacteria,
[02:03:05.040 --> 02:03:10.040]  viruses, mold and food poisoning, as well as help improve wound healing.
[02:03:10.040 --> 02:03:18.040]  Silver salt technology is safe enough to consume every day while powerful enough to destroy the causes of many serious diseases
[02:03:18.040 --> 02:03:23.040]  like strep throat, staph, pneumonia, colds, clues and other harmful pathogens.
[02:03:23.040 --> 02:03:29.040]  This new technology is much more effective than colloidal or ionic silvers and has the ability to terminate
[02:03:29.040 --> 02:03:36.040]  entire colonies of harmful bacteria at several hundred times the effectiveness of older solutions.
[02:03:36.040 --> 02:03:40.040]  Supernatural silver is what you need for any emergency.
[02:03:40.040 --> 02:03:49.040]  Go to supernaturalsilver.com today and use the promo code AlexSays for 20% off and like us on Facebook.
[02:03:49.040 --> 02:03:55.040]  The worst drought in 50 years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[02:03:55.040 --> 02:03:58.040]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[02:03:58.040 --> 02:04:04.040]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[02:04:04.040 --> 02:04:09.040]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[02:04:09.040 --> 02:04:16.040]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods or meat foods direct now.
[02:04:16.040 --> 02:04:20.040]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, e-foods will have to raise prices too.
[02:04:20.040 --> 02:04:22.040]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[02:04:22.040 --> 02:04:26.040]  I recently increased my supply from e-foods direct because we have all known this was coming.
[02:04:26.040 --> 02:04:29.040]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.
[02:04:29.040 --> 02:04:36.040]  The fact is you can eat at any time to save money today and because it stores for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[02:04:36.040 --> 02:04:42.040]  Don't wait. Call 800-409-5633 or go to e-foodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:04:42.040 --> 02:04:47.040]  Call 800-409-5633 or e-foodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:04:47.040 --> 02:04:49.040]  You can bet your life on e-foods direct.
[02:04:51.040 --> 02:04:59.040]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cow Bend Soap Company.
[02:04:59.040 --> 02:05:03.040]  Alex and his staff have used these pure soap products for years.
[02:05:03.040 --> 02:05:10.040]  These all-natural soaps are made from the highest quality vegetable and coconut oils that are earth-friendly and safe.

[02:05:24.040 --> 02:05:30.040]  Or save big with a one to two year supply of soaps for all your cleaning needs.
[02:05:30.040 --> 02:05:32.040]  This is an amazing deal.
[02:05:32.040 --> 02:05:37.040]  You can save thousands of dollars and you will love the way real soap makes you feel.

[02:05:51.040 --> 02:05:57.040]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[02:05:57.040 --> 02:06:00.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:06:00.040 --> 02:06:07.040]  Okay, we've only got Lindsay for another 12, 13 minutes. I promise to go to some calls.
[02:06:07.040 --> 02:06:09.040]  I might have to hold him in the next segment.
[02:06:09.040 --> 02:06:15.040]  We have another guest coming in studio to give us inside take on what the lead are up to as well.
[02:06:15.040 --> 02:06:17.040]  Again, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:06:17.040 --> 02:06:20.040]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:06:20.040 --> 02:06:26.040]  If you want to call and get the DVD breakdown film that Lindsay has produced,
[02:06:26.040 --> 02:06:32.040]  Secrets of the Elite, 888-799-6111, ProphecyClub.com.
[02:06:32.040 --> 02:06:34.040]  Lindsay doesn't have an official website.
[02:06:34.040 --> 02:06:39.040]  There's a fan site that has a lot of his material up on it, LindsayWilliams.net
[02:06:39.040 --> 02:06:46.040]  or 888-799-6111 to call and get his new audio CD and DVD film, ProphecyClub.com.
[02:06:46.040 --> 02:06:50.040]  We don't sell it, but we do endorse the research and the sources he has
[02:06:50.040 --> 02:06:52.040]  because they've proven quite accurate.
[02:06:52.040 --> 02:06:56.040]  I promise to go to these calls, so just in quick answers to recap,
[02:06:56.040 --> 02:07:00.040]  because some stations just joined us, to three reasons, the leader, Matt and Obama,
[02:07:00.040 --> 02:07:08.040]  and the message he was being sent, then what it means briefly that they're selling more derivatives into the market
[02:07:08.040 --> 02:07:15.040]  with bank or bailout money, QE Unlimited, and you said two years ago,
[02:07:15.040 --> 02:07:18.040]  Middle East will go up in flames, but that's a diversion, watch China.
[02:07:18.040 --> 02:07:24.040]  Since then, they've masked the ships, they admit that the new focus of the Pentagon is China.
[02:07:24.040 --> 02:07:29.040]  I mean, it's all happening, so your source, former CEO of a major big three oil company,
[02:07:29.040 --> 02:07:34.040]  is certainly getting some good intel, but just real fast cover those points.
[02:07:34.040 --> 02:07:39.040]  In 35 years, I've never been told one thing by the elite that it didn't happen exactly like they said
[02:07:39.040 --> 02:07:40.040]  it was going to take place.
[02:07:40.040 --> 02:07:46.040]  Obama was scared stiff the other day, and that's the reason he just said
[02:07:46.040 --> 02:07:51.040]  that's the reason he just literally stumbled all over himself.
[02:07:51.040 --> 02:07:58.040]  If the over elite have their way, he will not be the next president of the United States of America,
[02:07:58.040 --> 02:08:04.040]  and don't call me a prophet on election day comes around, it's just because they gave me information.
[02:08:04.040 --> 02:08:09.040]  Three things that they are irate over him about, the cross-counter pipeline,
[02:08:09.040 --> 02:08:12.040]  and by the way, it will go through if Romney gets in.
[02:08:12.040 --> 02:08:17.040]  Number two, the Dodge Frank Act will be rewritten if Romney gets in,
[02:08:17.040 --> 02:08:20.040]  and number three, the production of American oil.
[02:08:20.040 --> 02:08:22.040]  You haven't seen anything yet.
[02:08:22.040 --> 02:08:25.040]  There's a huge oil field under Denver, Colorado they want to open up.
[02:08:25.040 --> 02:08:30.040]  The Bakkenfield of the North and South Dakota in Montana, if anybody wants a job,
[02:08:30.040 --> 02:08:32.040]  you better get up there quick.
[02:08:32.040 --> 02:08:36.040]  You've never seen like, literally a mad rush.
[02:08:36.040 --> 02:08:43.040]  By the way, the Liberty Rig at Prudeau Bay, they stopped drilling temporarily.
[02:08:43.040 --> 02:08:49.040]  They've got to wait until they create enough mass chaos in the Middle East to get the price to $150.
[02:08:49.040 --> 02:08:52.040]  Sure, they've got all the gas wells turned off or down to nothing right now too, they're waiting.
[02:08:52.040 --> 02:08:54.040]  That's the words from inside.
[02:08:54.040 --> 02:08:58.040]  Now, again, China, what's going on with it on the radar?
[02:08:58.040 --> 02:09:01.040]  China is in big, big, big trouble.
[02:09:01.040 --> 02:09:06.040]  Mr. Fromm, before you ever died, used the expression, he said, China is the big one.
[02:09:06.040 --> 02:09:09.040]  Watch China more than North and South Korea.
[02:09:09.040 --> 02:09:11.040]  Watch China more than Israel in the Middle East.
[02:09:11.040 --> 02:09:13.040]  He said, watch China.
[02:09:13.040 --> 02:09:15.040]  This is where the action is going to come from.
[02:09:15.040 --> 02:09:17.040]  China is in drastic trouble.
[02:09:17.040 --> 02:09:18.040]  They have riots.
[02:09:18.040 --> 02:09:25.040]  Can you imagine Walmart or Target without any product on the shelf marked made in China?
[02:09:25.040 --> 02:09:30.040]  Folks, you had better take notice to what Mr. Fromm told me back a year and a half ago
[02:09:30.040 --> 02:09:32.040]  before you ever died.
[02:09:32.040 --> 02:09:36.040]  China has already said we'll allow our currency to float from 0.5 to 1.
[02:09:36.040 --> 02:09:40.040]  This was on April the 14th of 2012.
[02:09:40.040 --> 02:09:45.040]  Anytime they want to, they can double the price of every product in Walmart and Target,
[02:09:45.040 --> 02:09:47.040]  not made in China.
[02:09:47.040 --> 02:09:50.040]  You'd better pay attention to what China is doing.
[02:09:50.040 --> 02:09:53.040]  Again, the Middle East, you've never seen such chaos.
[02:09:53.040 --> 02:09:56.040]  I've given the next nations that are going to be taken over.
[02:09:56.040 --> 02:10:01.040]  You know what happened in Egypt, then in Libya, and now, of course, the Muslim Brotherhood
[02:10:01.040 --> 02:10:02.040]  will be given all of these.
[02:10:02.040 --> 02:10:07.040]  This is where Mr. Obama comes in in relation to ship to where he doubled across the elite
[02:10:07.040 --> 02:10:09.040]  because he wanted to cross.
[02:10:09.040 --> 02:10:11.040]  He did not want to cross country.
[02:10:11.040 --> 02:10:15.040]  Canada, Canadian pipeline, his elite friends.
[02:10:15.040 --> 02:10:19.040]  So there's truth to that, that they have the deal to only buy the oil from the Arabs
[02:10:19.040 --> 02:10:21.040]  if they keep buying the dollar.
[02:10:21.040 --> 02:10:23.040]  Obama's keeping the old Kissinger deal.
[02:10:23.040 --> 02:10:27.040]  And you said this a couple of years ago that this would happen and it has started.
[02:10:27.040 --> 02:10:28.040]  And so there is a fight.
[02:10:28.040 --> 02:10:32.040]  You're saying he really is double crossing the West with the Arabs?
[02:10:32.040 --> 02:10:34.040]  He positively has double crossed them.
[02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:36.040]  And this was the way that my elite friend put it one day.
[02:10:36.040 --> 02:10:38.040]  He was so angry on the telephone.
[02:10:38.040 --> 02:10:43.040]  And we were talking about the cross Canada pipeline and the American production of oil.
[02:10:43.040 --> 02:10:45.040]  And he sent me some emails on it.
[02:10:45.040 --> 02:10:48.040]  He said, Chaplin, I'm using his exact words.
[02:10:48.040 --> 02:10:49.040]  He said, he's a Muslim.
[02:10:49.040 --> 02:10:51.040]  And I said, what are you talking about?
[02:10:51.040 --> 02:10:54.040]  He said, in favor of his Muslim brotherhood friends,
[02:10:54.040 --> 02:10:59.040]  he canceled out on the cross Canada pipeline and double crossed us.
[02:10:59.040 --> 02:11:02.040]  And he said, he can't get by with this.
[02:11:02.040 --> 02:11:03.040]  This is more.
[02:11:03.040 --> 02:11:05.040]  Yeah, but see, that's the larger globalist plan.
[02:11:05.040 --> 02:11:07.040]  They're going to double cross the old American elite.
[02:11:07.040 --> 02:11:10.040]  My old, I mean, people that still think it's a global empire,
[02:11:10.040 --> 02:11:13.040]  but that we run it for China and the Middle East.
[02:11:13.040 --> 02:11:14.040]  And they're all going to get allied.
[02:11:14.040 --> 02:11:17.040]  I'm telling you, the globalists are going to destroy this country.
[02:11:17.040 --> 02:11:19.040]  This is larger than that.
[02:11:19.040 --> 02:11:22.040]  Let's, let's go to phone calls as promised.
[02:11:22.040 --> 02:11:25.040]  Lindsay, we've got to get you back up sometime this week for another hour.
[02:11:25.040 --> 02:11:27.040]  We'll talk during the break about when that is,
[02:11:27.040 --> 02:11:29.040]  but you're on fire with this info.
[02:11:29.040 --> 02:11:30.040]  I've never heard you so on fire.
[02:11:30.040 --> 02:11:32.040]  This is the best interview we've ever done.
[02:11:32.040 --> 02:11:36.040]  I know you've got tons of more data that really integrates them with my intel.
[02:11:36.040 --> 02:11:40.040]  Brendan in Wisconsin, you're on the air with Lindsay Williams.
[02:11:40.040 --> 02:11:41.040]  Hi, Alex.
[02:11:41.040 --> 02:11:43.040]  This is the front of yours from down in Chantilly.
[02:11:43.040 --> 02:11:47.040]  And I do have something for Lindsay regarding the elite.
[02:11:47.040 --> 02:11:51.040]  I was just wondering if I could shamelessly plug a prison planet,
[02:11:51.040 --> 02:11:55.040]  a free membership giveaway tonight and match money bomb donations.
[02:11:55.040 --> 02:11:56.040]  Is that okay?
[02:11:56.040 --> 02:11:58.040]  Well, sure.
[02:11:58.040 --> 02:11:59.040]  Thank you, sir.
[02:11:59.040 --> 02:12:02.040]  I mean, do you have a question for Lindsay?
[02:12:02.040 --> 02:12:03.040]  I do.
[02:12:03.040 --> 02:12:12.040]  And it involves price fixing as far as diesel goes back in 2006.
[02:12:12.040 --> 02:12:16.040]  When actually I was listening to your show and I think you had John Williams on
[02:12:16.040 --> 02:12:20.040]  and he said they're going to cease producing M3 monetary levels.
[02:12:20.040 --> 02:12:25.040]  And right around that time also the gas prices spiked.
[02:12:25.040 --> 02:12:27.040]  I'm sure most people remember it.
[02:12:27.040 --> 02:12:32.040]  And diesel for the first time was more expensive being a less refined fuel.
[02:12:32.040 --> 02:12:37.040]  And I own a diesel more expensive than regular gasoline.
[02:12:37.040 --> 02:12:42.040]  And I was wondering if that was almost like a hidden tax on all transport
[02:12:42.040 --> 02:12:47.040]  to further debase the currency if he had ever heard anything about that.
[02:12:47.040 --> 02:12:52.040]  And then if I could, Michael Murphy from Why in the World Are They Spring
[02:12:52.040 --> 02:12:56.040]  is coming to Madison tonight and I was going to give away a ton of memberships.
[02:12:56.040 --> 02:13:00.040]  Yeah, I don't really understand what you mean by giveawayprisonplanet.tv memberships,
[02:13:00.040 --> 02:13:02.040]  but I appreciate your call and your support, sir.
[02:13:02.040 --> 02:13:04.040]  We got to move quick here.
[02:13:04.040 --> 02:13:06.040]  Lindsay, your question about diesel.
[02:13:06.040 --> 02:13:10.040]  Proportionately, gasoline and diesel will go up every month.
[02:13:10.040 --> 02:13:15.040]  Proportionately to the devaluation of the dollar of $30 billion
[02:13:15.040 --> 02:13:19.040]  that the Federal Reserve is pulling out of thin air and buying mortgage-backed securities.
[02:13:19.040 --> 02:13:25.040]  You will see a monthly depreciation just as you saw it happen the day that he made that announcement.
[02:13:25.040 --> 02:13:29.040]  The gasoline did not go up the value of your currency went down.
[02:13:29.040 --> 02:13:31.040]  Absolutely.
[02:13:31.040 --> 02:13:33.040]  And the media will never say that.
[02:13:33.040 --> 02:13:39.040]  It's always speculators or refineries out or, you know, gremlins were chewing the wiring.
[02:13:39.040 --> 02:13:45.040]  But that's what the speculators know when they go to QE Unlimited that it's going to go up.
[02:13:45.040 --> 02:13:49.040]  So, of course, they start betting on that, which causes a lensing effect,
[02:13:49.040 --> 02:13:51.040]  but they're not the ones triggering it.
[02:13:51.040 --> 02:13:55.040]  I'm not defending speculators. I'm sick of it. I'm sick of the scapegoating.
[02:13:55.040 --> 02:13:58.040]  Diane in California, you're on the air. Welcome.
[02:13:58.040 --> 02:14:01.040]  Hi, Alex. How are you?
[02:14:01.040 --> 02:14:03.040]  Good. Do you have a question for Lindsay?
[02:14:03.040 --> 02:14:06.040]  Yeah. Yes, I have a question for Lindsay.
[02:14:06.040 --> 02:14:12.040]  Okay. I want to know about the World War III that's being set up.
[02:14:12.040 --> 02:14:21.040]  Is that a maneuver to lead the nation to sign a peace agreement in a way of introducing the New World Order?
[02:14:21.040 --> 02:14:25.040]  I do know that the New World Orders will be introduced in a completely different manner
[02:14:25.040 --> 02:14:28.040]  than what the average American is thinking about.
[02:14:28.040 --> 02:14:34.040]  And that's the reason I felt such a desperate need to produce our new CD series, Secrets of the Elite,
[02:14:34.040 --> 02:14:39.040]  because most people think they're going to bring in the New World Order one way.
[02:14:39.040 --> 02:14:43.040]  But no, it's the mindset of the elite until you understand it.
[02:14:43.040 --> 02:14:46.040]  I know. I know what the Devil Messiah is. That's what they call it.
[02:14:46.040 --> 02:14:50.040]  They're taking over all the churches. They're now removing crosses.
[02:14:50.040 --> 02:14:52.040]  I've got to get you back up this week. I know you know this,
[02:14:52.040 --> 02:14:57.040]  but have you heard in churches across the board, they are removing crosses now
[02:14:57.040 --> 02:15:01.040]  if they want the federal funds and it's being done covertly.
[02:15:01.040 --> 02:15:05.040]  Consultants now run all the major churches and they're globalist.
[02:15:05.040 --> 02:15:07.040]  They're Rockefeller Foundation operatives.
[02:15:07.040 --> 02:15:13.040]  And during the financial collapse in the wars, they're going to outlaw criticizing the Muslims first
[02:15:13.040 --> 02:15:16.040]  to ban free speech and it's going to be a UN law.
[02:15:16.040 --> 02:15:18.040]  Am I hitting on the right area, Lindsay?
[02:15:18.040 --> 02:15:22.040]  Alex, three years ago, please remember it back.
[02:15:22.040 --> 02:15:24.040]  It's in the archives of your program.
[02:15:24.040 --> 02:15:31.040]  The Devil's Messiah, do you remember when I told you that they had a program that Mr. Fromm told me about?
[02:15:31.040 --> 02:15:33.040]  To take the churches over.
[02:15:33.040 --> 02:15:36.040]  The Devil's Messiah program, they mentioned it by word.
[02:15:36.040 --> 02:15:40.040]  I gave it in detail. Now you're seeing it happen right before your eyes.
[02:15:40.040 --> 02:15:45.040]  I know. Presbyterian churches all over are removing crosses. Others are doing it.
[02:15:45.040 --> 02:15:47.040]  I mean, I can't believe I'm in America.
[02:15:47.040 --> 02:15:54.040]  I mean, it's crazy. The government tells parents they can't pack lunches nationwide now.
[02:15:54.040 --> 02:16:00.040]  I had another article out where they said, and by the way, we're going to start telling you what to eat at home.
[02:16:00.040 --> 02:16:01.040]  I didn't even get to that.
[02:16:01.040 --> 02:16:05.040]  It's like the kids won't eat what we have at school because of what you're eating at home.
[02:16:05.040 --> 02:16:07.040]  And we're going to tell you what to eat at home.
[02:16:07.040 --> 02:16:09.040]  I mean, it's all just insane.
[02:16:09.040 --> 02:16:12.040]  It's authoritarianism, Lindsay, because the average...
[02:16:12.040 --> 02:16:18.040]  World Order. And Alex, they're going to bring it in in such a different manner than what the average person thinks.
[02:16:18.040 --> 02:16:20.040]  Someone asked me on a show the other day, they said,
[02:16:20.040 --> 02:16:27.040]  Chaplain, why? Please, please, please tell me why would the elite destroy their own country?
[02:16:27.040 --> 02:16:30.040]  I live with the elite. I don't know who they are.
[02:16:30.040 --> 02:16:33.040]  I should say I know most of them, many of them.
[02:16:33.040 --> 02:16:37.040]  There were very few of them that lived outside the United States of America.
[02:16:37.040 --> 02:16:44.040]  They said, why would they destroy their own country? I said, you folks, you don't understand. Please, I beg of you.
[02:16:44.040 --> 02:16:48.040]  You don't understand their mindsets. The elite are not destroying their own country.
[02:16:48.040 --> 02:16:50.040]  They're taking over their own country.
[02:16:50.040 --> 02:16:53.040]  The name of the game is control.
[02:16:53.040 --> 02:16:57.040]  They want total control without confrontation.
[02:16:57.040 --> 02:16:59.040]  Folks, are you catching this?
[02:16:59.040 --> 02:17:04.040]  They want total control without protests, without revolution, without riots.
[02:17:04.040 --> 02:17:11.040]  They proved that they could do it. On September 13, when the Federal Reserve did what they did,
[02:17:11.040 --> 02:17:16.040]  you must understand the new World Order is merely taking over the country,
[02:17:16.040 --> 02:17:19.040]  and then on to their auspices, they'll bring it out the way that they want to.
[02:17:19.040 --> 02:17:23.040]  And that's why they attack any protesters now or any free speech
[02:17:23.040 --> 02:17:26.040]  and act like someone photographing in public is the end of the world.
[02:17:26.040 --> 02:17:29.040]  It's all about dominating us ahead of the collapse.
[02:17:29.040 --> 02:17:34.040]  I'm going to say bye to you here in the break because we have another very informative and important guest coming in
[02:17:34.040 --> 02:17:36.040]  that ties into all this in studio, Ron Hubbard.
[02:17:36.040 --> 02:17:38.040]  But Lindsay, I'm going to talk to you here in the break.
[02:17:38.040 --> 02:17:41.040]  I want to get you back on for an hour and a half later in the week
[02:17:41.040 --> 02:17:45.040]  because I've never heard you on fire like this, and it ties into all my research.
[02:17:45.040 --> 02:17:50.040]  I want to get you back on later in the week and continue with phone calls as well. We'll be right back.
[02:17:50.040 --> 02:17:55.040]  Alex Jones here with a message that could revolutionize health in this country.
[02:17:55.040 --> 02:18:01.040]  Going back about a year and a half ago, I began to learn about the incredible health effects of young Jevity products.
[02:18:01.040 --> 02:18:07.040]  Aaron Dykes lost 92 pounds. We're going to show you some before and afters.
[02:18:07.040 --> 02:18:10.040]  Aaron, break down what happened. You're storied.
[02:18:10.040 --> 02:18:13.040]  I've worked really hard with diet and exercises trying to lose weight,
[02:18:13.040 --> 02:18:16.040]  but I just didn't get the results. It just didn't happen.
[02:18:16.040 --> 02:18:19.040]  Then I saw what you were doing with infowarsteam.com.
[02:18:19.040 --> 02:18:23.040]  I wasn't even trying to lose weight, but I got it because I wanted to feel better energy.
[02:18:23.040 --> 02:18:28.040]  I wanted that nutrition. I didn't even understand how that could kickstart my own weight loss goals,
[02:18:28.040 --> 02:18:30.040]  but the products did that for me.
[02:18:30.040 --> 02:18:36.040]  I found myself suddenly losing weight, more energetic, wanting to exercise, wanting to eat the right foods,
[02:18:36.040 --> 02:18:38.040]  and they don't even advertise it as weight loss.
[02:18:38.040 --> 02:18:42.040]  I want to challenge our radio listeners to go to infowarsteam.com.
[02:18:42.040 --> 02:18:49.040]  Sign up as a distributor and get wholesale pricing discounts at infowarsteam.com.
[02:18:49.040 --> 02:18:53.040]  Friends, this is Alex Jones for mitusresources.com.
[02:18:53.040 --> 02:18:59.040]  For more than 15 years, I have exclusively used mitus resources for all my precious metal needs.
[02:18:59.040 --> 02:19:04.040]  Whether it's bullion or collectibles you're looking for, mitus resources is simply the best.
[02:19:04.040 --> 02:19:07.040]  I own my gold as a hedge against inflation.
[02:19:07.040 --> 02:19:13.040]  This Federal Reserve fiat currency could go the way of the Deutsche Mark and the Weimar Republic anytime.
[02:19:13.040 --> 02:19:18.040]  In these historically dangerous times, it makes sense to physically hold gold and silver.
[02:19:18.040 --> 02:19:21.040]  Mitus already has some of the best deals in the industry,
[02:19:21.040 --> 02:19:26.040]  but if you give them a call and mention the radio special, they will give you a list of the day's super specials.

[02:19:44.040 --> 02:19:48.040]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[02:20:14.040 --> 02:20:18.040]  You can do it yourself installation in about 15 minutes, and the best part?

[02:21:50.040 --> 02:22:09.040]  Music.
[02:22:09.040 --> 02:22:14.040]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, to break down how this happened,
[02:22:14.040 --> 02:22:20.040]  it ties into what Lindsay Williams was just talking about, who by the way is back with us for two hours on Friday.
[02:22:20.040 --> 02:22:23.040]  He'll be on the second and third hour at Lindsay Williams to take your calls.
[02:22:23.040 --> 02:22:27.040]  I know we've got callers on hold, I'll try to get to you before the hour ends.
[02:22:27.040 --> 02:22:29.040]  But so much is happening.
[02:22:29.040 --> 02:22:33.040]  I've decided to stay here in the United States during the globalist engineered meltdown.
[02:22:33.040 --> 02:22:37.040]  I believe when we expose them, we may be able to back them off and they won't go all the way.
[02:22:37.040 --> 02:22:39.040]  That's exactly what Lindsay Williams' source said.
[02:22:39.040 --> 02:22:44.040]  They're testing us and I'm trying to get people to peacefully speak out and say no,
[02:22:44.040 --> 02:22:48.040]  to get police to say no, we're not going to be federalized, to have the states say no.
[02:22:48.040 --> 02:22:50.040]  And we're starting to see some of that.
[02:22:50.040 --> 02:22:53.040]  But if we don't, they're going to implode things to re-engineer us.
[02:22:53.040 --> 02:22:57.040]  Just like the Marines tear you down before they build you back up in their image.
[02:22:57.040 --> 02:23:02.040]  The globalists are going to tear us down, but never build us back up because their image of us is in the dirt.
[02:23:02.040 --> 02:23:07.040]  Now, I began to look because I'm in tornado alley for a tornado shelter and for the price of them,
[02:23:07.040 --> 02:23:12.040]  we're only like a foot underground or whatever, they're not good for radiological events,
[02:23:12.040 --> 02:23:14.040]  biological events, chemical events.
[02:23:14.040 --> 02:23:16.040]  You bury them 10 feet under the ground.
[02:23:16.040 --> 02:23:20.040]  Well, then you're really protected because I live on nine acres to be technical,
[02:23:20.040 --> 02:23:24.040]  I guess about nine and a half, outside Austin, Texas.
[02:23:24.040 --> 02:23:29.040]  And I started looking and I found Atlas shelters.
[02:23:29.040 --> 02:23:32.040]  And they're not a sponsor yet, but I'm trying to get them as one.
[02:23:32.040 --> 02:23:36.040]  The real reason this is happening is I'm shopping around for an underground bomb shelter
[02:23:36.040 --> 02:23:39.040]  that doubles as a tornado shelter because I'm in tornado alley.
[02:23:39.040 --> 02:23:42.040]  I mean, they hit us all the time, kind of ends at about Austin,
[02:23:42.040 --> 02:23:44.040]  but killed 30-something people in Gerald.
[02:23:44.040 --> 02:23:45.040]  It's crazy.
[02:23:45.040 --> 02:23:50.040]  And this is a short segment, but Ron Hubbard has been one of the pioneers in the big,
[02:23:50.040 --> 02:23:53.040]  pretty coronate steel doors you see on fancy houses.
[02:23:53.040 --> 02:23:56.040]  And he's the big name on national TV shows.
[02:23:56.040 --> 02:24:01.040]  You name it with really, I don't call them luxury, but beautiful.
[02:24:01.040 --> 02:24:06.040]  I don't mean to turn this into a plug for his stuff, I've just got him on to talk about it.
[02:24:06.040 --> 02:24:10.040]  But the reason he's here is to talk about the fact that he's selling out of these things.
[02:24:10.040 --> 02:24:13.040]  He's building them as fast as he can, big ones, little ones, you name it,
[02:24:13.040 --> 02:24:14.040]  sold out of the big ones.
[02:24:14.040 --> 02:24:18.040]  He was on, got rid of all of his brochures, you name it.
[02:24:18.040 --> 02:24:27.040]  But the point is he was on the TV show just a week or so ago with us and got a huge response.
[02:24:27.040 --> 02:24:31.040]  But the reason I've got him here in Texas, because he lives here in Texas part of the time,
[02:24:31.040 --> 02:24:37.040]  he's out in California, he is a Texan, is because I'm looking at one and trying to get him out to my house,
[02:24:37.040 --> 02:24:40.040]  because it's rock out there to see about putting one in.
[02:24:40.040 --> 02:24:45.040]  So I thought, why not do an interview about this and see if TV viewers are interested like I am.
[02:24:45.040 --> 02:24:47.040]  And that is indeed what happened.
[02:24:47.040 --> 02:24:49.040]  People went crazy over it.
[02:24:49.040 --> 02:24:51.040]  Now we're about to go to break here in long segments coming up.
[02:24:51.040 --> 02:24:56.040]  Ron Hubbard of Atlas SurvivalShelters.com is the website.
[02:24:56.040 --> 02:25:01.040]  And again, we can show his site and kind of show people what he does inside of these.
[02:25:01.040 --> 02:25:06.040]  But you were confirming what a lot of our other expert guests, like Joel Scalzen,
[02:25:06.040 --> 02:25:10.040]  who's the best-selling author of The Secure Home and the rest of it,
[02:25:10.040 --> 02:25:14.040]  he is saying that it's the elites building them under their houses.
[02:25:14.040 --> 02:25:17.040]  They want them where they're not known, like in Denver and places,
[02:25:17.040 --> 02:25:20.040]  and that there's a huge upsurge the last year.
[02:25:20.040 --> 02:25:25.040]  So whatever's coming, financial, war, planet, Kebler, whatever it is,
[02:25:25.040 --> 02:25:30.040]  2012, which I don't believe in, something's going on to briefly tell us,
[02:25:30.040 --> 02:25:31.040]  and thanks for coming in.
[02:25:31.040 --> 02:25:36.040]  I know you won't talk about your customers, but obviously government, rich people,
[02:25:36.040 --> 02:25:38.040]  you were telling me off here, it's exploded.
[02:25:38.040 --> 02:25:41.040]  Why are they telling you they're doing this?
[02:25:41.040 --> 02:25:45.040]  Well, if you ask 10 different people, you're going to get 10 different answers.
[02:25:45.040 --> 02:25:51.040]  But the answer that I seem to get that I kind of buy into is coming from scientists.
[02:25:51.040 --> 02:25:56.040]  They believe that solar flares and radiation showers are going to be coming in
[02:25:56.040 --> 02:25:59.040]  towards the end of the year, and it's sitting there listening to them.
[02:25:59.040 --> 02:26:00.040]  It's scientific.
[02:26:00.040 --> 02:26:03.040]  I've kind of bought into that, plus I don't trust our government.
[02:26:03.040 --> 02:26:09.040]  I don't like what's going on out there, and I'm just prepared for anything.
[02:26:09.040 --> 02:26:11.040]  So that's why I call them all.
[02:26:11.040 --> 02:26:12.040]  And I know you're nervous about this.
[02:26:12.040 --> 02:26:13.040]  You didn't even want to come on air.
[02:26:13.040 --> 02:26:15.040]  I twisted your arm into TV.
[02:26:15.040 --> 02:26:19.040]  I mean, are you glad you came in because you've done tape stuff for Discovery Channel
[02:26:19.040 --> 02:26:21.040]  and all those big shows?
[02:26:21.040 --> 02:26:23.040]  But I mean, here you are live now, so don't be nervous.
[02:26:23.040 --> 02:26:24.040]  You put me on the spot.
[02:26:24.040 --> 02:26:25.040]  No, but thanks for coming in.
[02:26:25.040 --> 02:26:29.040]  I mean, you were going to be in South Texas, so thanks for flying here.
[02:26:29.040 --> 02:26:31.040]  I appreciate it.
[02:26:31.040 --> 02:26:36.040]  No, it's just that, I mean, so they're telling you for that reason.
[02:26:36.040 --> 02:26:39.040]  Why else are they telling you?
[02:26:39.040 --> 02:26:43.040]  People buy shelters because they want to be secure.
[02:26:43.040 --> 02:26:44.040]  They want some safety.
[02:26:44.040 --> 02:26:48.040]  If you buy insurance in case you're going to have an accident, you have the peace of mind.
[02:26:48.040 --> 02:26:51.040]  People are buying shelters because they want peace of mind.
[02:26:51.040 --> 02:26:55.040]  If something happened right now and you had to go underground for 14 days, where would you go, Alex?
[02:26:55.040 --> 02:26:57.040]  You don't have an answer to that, do you?
[02:26:57.040 --> 02:26:58.040]  No.
[02:26:58.040 --> 02:27:00.040]  So there's going to be the haze and the have-nots.
[02:27:00.040 --> 02:27:04.040]  The people we always hear about zombies out there, well, those are the people that don't have shelters,
[02:27:04.040 --> 02:27:06.040]  don't have food, don't have water, okay?
[02:27:06.040 --> 02:27:08.040]  Well, the people that have the shelters are the non-zombies.
[02:27:08.040 --> 02:27:11.040]  These are the people that are going to be the survivors.
[02:27:11.040 --> 02:27:13.040]  Stay there and break this down when we come back.
[02:27:13.040 --> 02:27:18.040]  The difference between a tornado shelter and a bomb shelter, a fallout shelter, like the types you have.
[02:27:18.040 --> 02:27:22.040]  And again, the fact that the elite are buying these as fast as you can make them.
[02:27:22.040 --> 02:27:24.040]  Why is that happening?
[02:27:24.040 --> 02:27:27.040]  I mean, all I know is they're doing it from all my sources.
[02:27:27.040 --> 02:27:29.040]  So that's just another intel indicator.
[02:27:29.040 --> 02:27:33.040]  Why do they have regular army running checkpoints all over the country right now?
[02:27:33.040 --> 02:27:35.040]  Well, they say they're getting ready to hit Iran.
[02:27:35.040 --> 02:27:37.040]  I don't know if that's the case.
[02:27:37.040 --> 02:27:39.040]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:39.040 --> 02:27:43.040]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:43.040 --> 02:28:09.040]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:28:13.040 --> 02:28:18.040]  We have 42 certified. Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[02:28:18.040 --> 02:28:21.040]  Easy to set up and use. Doesn't require electricity.
[02:28:21.040 --> 02:28:24.040]  Purify water from lake streams, ponds, and wells.
[02:28:24.040 --> 02:28:27.040]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[02:28:27.040 --> 02:28:32.040]  Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[02:28:32.040 --> 02:28:34.040]  Propyr is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[02:28:34.040 --> 02:28:36.040]  It's what my family uses.
[02:28:36.040 --> 02:28:39.040]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on Propyr.
[02:28:39.040 --> 02:28:45.040]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off and Infowars.com.
[02:28:45.040 --> 02:29:10.040]  You can also call to order 888-253-3139.
[02:29:16.040 --> 02:29:22.040]  Even today, Japanese eat miso, Africans eat fermented porges, Koreans eat kamichi,
[02:29:22.040 --> 02:29:25.040]  and in India, fermented milk is a staple for healthy living.
[02:29:25.040 --> 02:29:26.040]  But here's some good news.
[02:29:26.040 --> 02:29:32.040]  Self-reliant Americans can now discover the secrets to making these amazing fermented foods legally and privately in their own homes.
[02:29:32.040 --> 02:29:35.040]  Since it's still legal to make these foods as long as you can make them yourself.
[02:29:35.040 --> 02:29:38.040]  For more information, check out fermentationfactor.com.
[02:29:38.040 --> 02:29:40.040]  That's fermentationfactor.com.
[02:29:40.040 --> 02:29:46.040]  It's easy to create your own powerful fermented foods, and you can do it by going to www.fermentationfactor.com.
[02:29:46.040 --> 02:30:11.040]  That's www.fermentationfactor.com.
[02:30:16.040 --> 02:30:19.040]  So who Obama's real daddy is, this is the film for you.
[02:30:19.040 --> 02:30:24.040]  Don't forget, your purchase supports our broadcast and our growing media network.
[02:30:24.040 --> 02:30:26.040]  You'll also find it in www.FullWarShop.com.
[02:30:26.040 --> 02:30:30.040]  None dare call a conspiracy by Gary Allen, the book that woke me up.
[02:30:30.040 --> 02:30:35.040]  We're also carrying behind the green mask, You and Agenda 21 by Rosa Corey.
[02:30:35.040 --> 02:30:38.040]  This book is coffin nails to the globalist takeover.
[02:30:38.040 --> 02:30:42.040]  The greater good, the most professional and up-to-date film I've ever seen,
[02:30:42.040 --> 02:30:45.040]  exposing the scourge that is vaccines.
[02:30:45.040 --> 02:30:50.040]  Tools and a lot more are all available at infowarshop.com.
[02:31:16.040 --> 02:31:21.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[02:31:21.040 --> 02:31:27.040]  And I'm here Monday through Friday, 12 noon to 3 p.m. Eastern on over 120 AM and FM stations.
[02:31:27.040 --> 02:31:34.040]  Shyamal Cash on XM166, streaming audio and video at infowars.com and prismwana.com,
[02:31:34.040 --> 02:31:36.040]  as well as prismplanet.tv.
[02:31:36.040 --> 02:31:41.040]  We use the info war to fight back against the globalist trying to set up their prison planet.
[02:31:41.040 --> 02:31:45.040]  Again, I did drag Ron in there. That's why I was thanking him earlier.
[02:31:45.040 --> 02:31:47.040]  He thought I was saying that he wasn't doing a good job.
[02:31:47.040 --> 02:31:55.040]  He said no to Jay Leno's show. He's on storage wars, doomsday preppers.
[02:31:55.040 --> 02:31:59.040]  He's got shows coming out on decoded, shipping wars.
[02:31:59.040 --> 02:32:04.040]  Why are you, of all the manufacturers, I guess you're the biggest and most,
[02:32:04.040 --> 02:32:09.040]  why are you so hot? I mean, you're telling me about how many TV shows you name it
[02:32:09.040 --> 02:32:12.040]  and trying to get you on, and how was I able to get you in here?
[02:32:12.040 --> 02:32:14.040]  I guess because I'm going to buy a shelter.
[02:32:14.040 --> 02:32:16.040]  Well, I like you, first of all, and I'll listen to you.
[02:32:16.040 --> 02:32:21.040]  But the reason I'm popular right now is because I took what is conceived as a bomb shelter,
[02:32:21.040 --> 02:32:25.040]  which is something doom and gloom, and I've turned it into nicer in most apartments.
[02:32:25.040 --> 02:32:27.040]  It's like a home down there.
[02:32:27.040 --> 02:32:35.040]  So people that are buying them, I'm trying to convince them that the shelter's not only an emergency shelter,
[02:32:35.040 --> 02:32:39.040]  it's a place that you can use as a retreat, a cabin, a second home.
[02:32:39.040 --> 02:32:41.040]  It's always cool if it's below seven feet on the ground.
[02:32:41.040 --> 02:32:45.040]  It's 10 feet underground. It stays around 65 degrees. It's nice.
[02:32:45.040 --> 02:32:48.040]  It's climate-controlled, and it's enjoyable.
[02:32:48.040 --> 02:32:51.040]  And they're not claustrophobic. They're quite roomy down there.
[02:32:51.040 --> 02:32:54.040]  Well, I'm going to try to get one of the big roomy ones.
[02:32:54.040 --> 02:32:57.040]  By the way, we crashed your website.
[02:32:57.040 --> 02:33:01.040]  We've got it up on a version that we haven't refreshed or it's crashed.
[02:33:01.040 --> 02:33:06.040]  AtlasSurvivalShelters.com has crashed. Have you ever had your website crashed before?
[02:33:06.040 --> 02:33:08.040]  No, that's the first time.
[02:33:08.040 --> 02:33:12.040]  I warned you. I said, now listen, you go on the TV, that's seen by hundreds of thousands.
[02:33:12.040 --> 02:33:16.040]  This is three million listeners right now, so they crash people's websites.
[02:33:16.040 --> 02:33:21.040]  Man, I had so many questions to get into here.
[02:33:21.040 --> 02:33:25.040]  When you deal with mainstream television, I know sometimes they try to make a joke out of it,
[02:33:25.040 --> 02:33:29.040]  but the military's digging in, the establishment's buying.
[02:33:29.040 --> 02:33:32.040]  Did you see where they've now bought 1.6 million bullets?
[02:33:32.040 --> 02:33:34.040]  Oh, yeah. Yeah, I saw that.
[02:33:34.040 --> 02:33:36.040]  What do you think's going on with that?
[02:33:36.040 --> 02:33:38.040]  Well, they apparently know, you know what?
[02:33:38.040 --> 02:33:43.040]  Our government is building shelters for itself, and they're not building shelters for us.
[02:33:43.040 --> 02:33:48.040]  And they know something that other governments know, but they're taking care of their citizens.
[02:33:48.040 --> 02:33:50.040]  Russia's building 6,000 bomb shelters.
[02:33:50.040 --> 02:33:54.040]  America's building bomb shelters, but they're not telling the public that they're building bomb shelters for us.
[02:33:54.040 --> 02:33:59.040]  That's right. Switzerland and Russia, they build them for their people, and they're very nice,
[02:33:59.040 --> 02:34:02.040]  and have two-year supplies and things in the case of Switzerland.
[02:34:02.040 --> 02:34:07.040]  And the government gives them hand grenades, rocket launchers, and machine guns by law in these bunkers.
[02:34:07.040 --> 02:34:09.040]  They've got to have machine guns at home.
[02:34:09.040 --> 02:34:12.040]  Here, though, our fallout shelter, tell folks about that.
[02:34:12.040 --> 02:34:16.040]  The government designates the underground parking garages.
[02:34:16.040 --> 02:34:20.040]  Well, if you're interested in buying a shelter,
[02:34:20.040 --> 02:34:24.040]  and you buy a shelter from a company that's registered with the Department of Defense,
[02:34:24.040 --> 02:34:28.040]  as I tried two years ago, this is how I ended in the business,
[02:34:28.040 --> 02:34:32.040]  you have to register with the government to get a permit for the shelter.
[02:34:32.040 --> 02:34:37.040]  And I'm like, well, this is where I'm trying to protect myself from in case our government does go corrupt.
[02:34:37.040 --> 02:34:41.040]  So that's how you went from being a big manufacturer of steel doors that you still do into these,
[02:34:41.040 --> 02:34:43.040]  because you couldn't get one yourself.
[02:34:43.040 --> 02:34:46.040]  Well, I could get one myself, but you got to register and get a permit with the government.
[02:34:46.040 --> 02:34:49.040]  Well, then the government knows where all the cast days of food is.
[02:34:49.040 --> 02:34:51.040]  I don't want them to know about it.
[02:34:51.040 --> 02:34:55.040]  So I make shelters and I'm not registered with the Department of Defense.
[02:34:55.040 --> 02:34:58.040]  So when I do a shelter, nobody's going to know about it, but you and me.
[02:34:58.040 --> 02:35:01.040]  What if somebody wants to pull up with their own 18-wheeler by one,
[02:35:01.040 --> 02:35:03.040]  and then you don't even know where it goes?
[02:35:03.040 --> 02:35:06.040]  I actually don't keep a record of where they go.
[02:35:06.040 --> 02:35:08.040]  If somebody came and put a gun in my head right now and said,
[02:35:08.040 --> 02:35:11.040]  we're all the shelters, I honestly couldn't tell them to save my life.
[02:35:11.040 --> 02:35:15.040]  How many do you install versus how many just roll off into the mist?
[02:35:15.040 --> 02:35:20.040]  Some people put in their own shelters I never see or hear from the people again.
[02:35:20.040 --> 02:35:24.040]  Other people want me to fly a contractor out there to install
[02:35:24.040 --> 02:35:28.040]  and hook up all the septic and water tanks and the plumbing and electrical, the cameras.
[02:35:28.040 --> 02:35:31.040]  How many years ago did you start looking for a shelter and then get into the business?
[02:35:31.040 --> 02:35:33.040]  Four or five years ago.
[02:35:33.040 --> 02:35:37.040]  And then again, what then spurred you as a successful businessman
[02:35:37.040 --> 02:35:40.040]  and builder to want to get one yourself?
[02:35:40.040 --> 02:35:45.040]  Well, first of all, the concrete shelters are $2-3 million.
[02:35:45.040 --> 02:35:49.040]  And I don't have $2-3 million to spend on a shelter.
[02:35:49.040 --> 02:35:55.040]  So the other shelters I went looked at, there were basically just boxes buried two feet underground.
[02:35:55.040 --> 02:35:57.040]  But in the summer here in Texas, it's 106 degrees.
[02:35:57.040 --> 02:35:59.040]  You go down there, you're two feet under the surface.
[02:35:59.040 --> 02:36:01.040]  Well, it's 110 degrees down there. You'll cook.
[02:36:01.040 --> 02:36:04.040]  At best, it's a tornado shelter.
[02:36:04.040 --> 02:36:06.040]  So the best shelters I found are the deeper.
[02:36:06.040 --> 02:36:08.040]  The deeper you go, the better off you are.
[02:36:08.040 --> 02:36:11.040]  I try to at least get all my shelters 10 feet deep so I could control the climate.
[02:36:11.040 --> 02:36:13.040]  Plus, they're blastproof.
[02:36:13.040 --> 02:36:18.040]  If you have a one megaton bongo off a mile in the air and you're at ground zero
[02:36:18.040 --> 02:36:21.040]  and when my shelter is the waste design, you're supposed to survive that.
[02:36:21.040 --> 02:36:28.040]  And for most that don't know, they detonate the hydrogen bombs at about a half mile to a mile to have a large radius flashpoint.
[02:36:28.040 --> 02:36:30.040]  People say, well, what if they drop the bomb on me?
[02:36:30.040 --> 02:36:33.040]  The point is, that's why shelters protect you.
[02:36:33.040 --> 02:36:36.040]  They don't drop the hydrogen or atomic bombs at ground zero
[02:36:36.040 --> 02:36:38.040]  because it doesn't have one tenth the kill radius.
[02:36:38.040 --> 02:36:41.040]  No, they detonate them at a mile altitude.
[02:36:41.040 --> 02:36:46.040]  If they're bombing Iranian nuke bunkers, they will be bunker busting.
[02:36:46.040 --> 02:36:47.040]  Those will go in.
[02:36:47.040 --> 02:36:48.040]  Those will be ground level.
[02:36:48.040 --> 02:36:51.040]  And that will not be inhabited for a long time.
[02:36:51.040 --> 02:36:52.040]  Yeah, it will release.
[02:36:52.040 --> 02:36:57.040]  And for those that don't know, all the metal in the ground will then throw off horrible isotopes,
[02:36:57.040 --> 02:36:59.040]  which will make Fukushima look like a cakewalk.
[02:36:59.040 --> 02:37:00.040]  Oh, yeah.
[02:37:00.040 --> 02:37:01.040]  Anyway, side issue.
[02:37:01.040 --> 02:37:02.040]  That's why I want my bunker.
[02:37:02.040 --> 02:37:05.040]  In fact, unfortunately, I'm running out of time here.
[02:37:05.040 --> 02:37:06.040]  Yeah.
[02:37:06.040 --> 02:37:08.040]  Anyways, you're going to have time to go out to my house.
[02:37:08.040 --> 02:37:10.040]  There's enough time before the end of the year to get a shelter
[02:37:10.040 --> 02:37:11.040]  if you're really interested in one.
[02:37:11.040 --> 02:37:13.040]  Well, I mean, look, they may hit Iran after that, whatever.
[02:37:13.040 --> 02:37:16.040]  The world's just so crazy if the government's buying bunkers
[02:37:16.040 --> 02:37:19.040]  and 1.6 million rounds of ammo.
[02:37:19.040 --> 02:37:20.040]  Our government's done.
[02:37:20.040 --> 02:37:21.040]  We're prepared.
[02:37:21.040 --> 02:37:23.040]  Our government's got the bunkers in.
[02:37:23.040 --> 02:37:26.040]  They stopped buying up the air filtration systems months ago.
[02:37:26.040 --> 02:37:28.040]  Yeah, you were telling me that a year or so ago.
[02:37:28.040 --> 02:37:29.040]  They couldn't get the air.
[02:37:29.040 --> 02:37:30.040]  Yeah, you couldn't get the air.
[02:37:30.040 --> 02:37:31.040]  Government's buying them up.
[02:37:31.040 --> 02:37:34.040]  Now you can get the air systems, so they're prepared.
[02:37:34.040 --> 02:37:35.040]  So now they're getting the food.
[02:37:35.040 --> 02:37:37.040]  They bought a billion rations of food.
[02:37:37.040 --> 02:37:38.040]  They're buying all this.
[02:37:38.040 --> 02:37:40.040]  They're buying all the ammunition.
[02:37:40.040 --> 02:37:43.040]  I don't think it's 2012, bro.
[02:37:43.040 --> 02:37:45.040]  They're getting ready for World War III.
[02:37:45.040 --> 02:37:50.040]  Well, I've always known that Israel needs to take care of Iran.
[02:37:50.040 --> 02:37:52.040]  And if they don't, we got to do something.
[02:37:52.040 --> 02:37:56.040]  And the reprisals is going to be held to pay.
[02:37:56.040 --> 02:37:58.040]  So.
[02:37:58.040 --> 02:38:02.040]  But I mean, if Iran gets a nuke, Israel's got 400 of them.
[02:38:02.040 --> 02:38:05.040]  I mean, they've got any missile systems.
[02:38:05.040 --> 02:38:07.040]  I mean, why start the war?
[02:38:07.040 --> 02:38:11.040]  I mean, Secretary of Defense, former Secretary of Defense Gates says we shouldn't do that.
[02:38:11.040 --> 02:38:12.040]  It says it'll be a catastrophe.
[02:38:12.040 --> 02:38:14.040]  We have to.
[02:38:14.040 --> 02:38:15.040]  We have to.
[02:38:15.040 --> 02:38:16.040]  We have to eliminate the threat.
[02:38:16.040 --> 02:38:18.040]  If Obama doesn't do it, Romney will.
[02:38:18.040 --> 02:38:20.040]  If he's elected.
[02:38:20.040 --> 02:38:23.040]  Do you think then the threat goes down if Romney gets elected?
[02:38:23.040 --> 02:38:25.040]  Well, Iran has to be dealt with.
[02:38:25.040 --> 02:38:28.040]  There's no ifs ands or buts around it.
[02:38:28.040 --> 02:38:29.040]  We got to deal with him.
[02:38:29.040 --> 02:38:30.040]  Well, I know this.
[02:38:30.040 --> 02:38:32.040]  They have out now or deal with them once they got the nuke.
[02:38:32.040 --> 02:38:38.040]  If I wasn't, look, look, look, all I know is, is that why does Iran keep saying rhetoric
[02:38:38.040 --> 02:38:39.040]  like they're going to blow this and that up?
[02:38:39.040 --> 02:38:41.040]  I mean, it's like asking for it.
[02:38:41.040 --> 02:38:44.040]  Well, that's how crazy they are over there.
[02:38:44.040 --> 02:38:48.040]  Well, about 75% of their people in international polls are actually pro America.
[02:38:48.040 --> 02:38:49.040]  They hate their government.
[02:38:49.040 --> 02:38:50.040]  I know.
[02:38:50.040 --> 02:38:51.040]  But now they're going to hate us.
[02:38:51.040 --> 02:38:56.040]  You don't see the ones with the money in the because, you know, actually there's a good market for me in Iran,
[02:38:56.040 --> 02:38:59.040]  but I can't build shelters in Israel and sell them to Iran.
[02:38:59.040 --> 02:39:01.040]  So the only place I can build shelters over there is in Jordan,
[02:39:01.040 --> 02:39:03.040]  and then I can sell them to Iran and Israel.
[02:39:03.040 --> 02:39:04.040]  That's right.
[02:39:04.040 --> 02:39:07.040]  You've actually been telling me huge operations down with Israel.
[02:39:07.040 --> 02:39:09.040]  I'm working on it right now.
[02:39:09.040 --> 02:39:11.040]  Yeah, those people really have something to fear.
[02:39:11.040 --> 02:39:14.040]  They, they, they, that's going to be a good market.
[02:39:14.040 --> 02:39:17.040]  But I don't think there's time for me to get in there right now.
[02:39:17.040 --> 02:39:18.040]  That's what you told me on the phone.
[02:39:18.040 --> 02:39:20.040]  Yeah, I, I, it's too late.
[02:39:20.040 --> 02:39:22.040]  I've told him, I think it's too late.
[02:39:22.040 --> 02:39:26.040]  The bonds will be flying before I can get over and get set by December.
[02:39:26.040 --> 02:39:30.040]  And just since I've been twiddling my thumbs the last two weeks,
[02:39:30.040 --> 02:39:31.040]  you sold out all the big ones.
[02:39:31.040 --> 02:39:33.040]  How long do you can make me one of the big ones?
[02:39:33.040 --> 02:39:36.040]  Since you're special, I'll get you one before the end of the year,
[02:39:36.040 --> 02:39:39.040]  but if people don't get the orders in now, it's going to be tough to,
[02:39:39.040 --> 02:39:41.040]  and I can't guarantee I can get everybody.
[02:39:41.040 --> 02:39:44.040]  I just can't believe that we've legitimately got to talk about this.
[02:39:44.040 --> 02:39:45.040]  I know.
[02:39:45.040 --> 02:39:48.040]  I mean, I mean, I'm getting to the point where my wife's like,
[02:39:48.040 --> 02:39:49.040]  we got to have a bomb shelter.
[02:39:49.040 --> 02:39:55.040]  I mean, you know, the people that scare me now because they all,
[02:39:55.040 --> 02:39:57.040]  you know, some of them got these crazy ideas,
[02:39:57.040 --> 02:40:00.040]  but it's the ones that are legitimate that are in the military
[02:40:00.040 --> 02:40:02.040]  and there are scientists that they tell me the reasons for it.
[02:40:02.040 --> 02:40:03.040]  And I go, you know what?
[02:40:03.040 --> 02:40:04.040]  You just scared me.
[02:40:04.040 --> 02:40:06.040]  And they give me, they give me little bumps on my arm.
[02:40:06.040 --> 02:40:07.040]  It's like, you know what?
[02:40:07.040 --> 02:40:11.040]  I thought I was doing something that was hopefully never needed,
[02:40:11.040 --> 02:40:14.040]  but you really make me feel like I'm going to need this sooner than later.
[02:40:14.040 --> 02:40:19.040]  I hope I never have to use the shelter other than the hunting cabin I'm using it for now.
[02:40:19.040 --> 02:40:21.040]  But we'll find out soon.
[02:40:21.040 --> 02:40:22.040]  Well, that's the thing.
[02:40:22.040 --> 02:40:24.040]  It is like a second home or an addition.
[02:40:24.040 --> 02:40:27.040]  Because when it is below seven feet, you bury them at 20 feet.
[02:40:27.040 --> 02:40:28.040]  So the top's 10 feet.
[02:40:28.040 --> 02:40:31.040]  I mean, it goes with what's it called the thermal line.
[02:40:31.040 --> 02:40:32.040]  The thermal break.
[02:40:32.040 --> 02:40:34.040]  So it stays about, what about 65 degrees?
[02:40:34.040 --> 02:40:35.040]  Like a wine cellar.
[02:40:35.040 --> 02:40:37.040]  That's why wine cellars are buried like that.
[02:40:37.040 --> 02:40:39.040]  They keep the wine at that constant temperature.
[02:40:39.040 --> 02:40:40.040]  And that's the same with the shelters.
[02:40:40.040 --> 02:40:43.040]  As long as the air is moving, you'll maintain 65 degree temperature.
[02:40:43.040 --> 02:40:45.040]  Or they're about.
[02:40:45.040 --> 02:40:48.040]  And these are less than one tenth one of the big concrete shelters.
[02:40:48.040 --> 02:40:50.040]  Oh, yeah, those concrete shelters.
[02:40:50.040 --> 02:40:51.040]  Well, hopefully your site goes back.
[02:40:51.040 --> 02:40:54.040]  A couple of people can look at them atlasurvivalshelters.com.
[02:40:54.040 --> 02:40:58.040]  Do make sure they click on the shelter models because it seems like my website's been,
[02:40:58.040 --> 02:41:01.040]  I've been told it's hard to navigate, but on the homepage, there's really good pictures.
[02:41:01.040 --> 02:41:02.040]  No, it's not hard to navigate.
[02:41:02.040 --> 02:41:03.040]  It's just big.
[02:41:03.040 --> 02:41:05.040]  Well, that's why, that's why I call it.
[02:41:05.040 --> 02:41:07.040]  I have over a thousand pictures on my website.
[02:41:07.040 --> 02:41:10.040]  I don't leave any imagination to the mind.
[02:41:10.040 --> 02:41:11.040]  I show how they're installed.
[02:41:11.040 --> 02:41:18.040]  I show the septic systems, the battery systems, the generators, the air filtration systems,
[02:41:18.040 --> 02:41:19.040]  blast hatches, a scale.
[02:41:19.040 --> 02:41:22.040]  Well, that was why I ended up getting ahold of you because I always search out the,
[02:41:22.040 --> 02:41:26.040]  you know, whoever, uh, well, the research and reviews say is the best.
[02:41:26.040 --> 02:41:30.040]  And you're the guy that builds something that's really livable, not a death trap.
[02:41:30.040 --> 02:41:33.040]  I mean, if nukes go off and you got to stay in there a month and a half,
[02:41:33.040 --> 02:41:37.040]  nobody's staying in some little storm shelter for a month and a half.
[02:41:37.040 --> 02:41:38.040]  I started in RV.
[02:41:38.040 --> 02:41:39.040]  It's 10 feet wide in there.
[02:41:39.040 --> 02:41:40.040]  You've got over seven foot ceilings.
[02:41:40.040 --> 02:41:42.040]  It doesn't feel like a boxer.
[02:41:42.040 --> 02:41:45.040]  Guys, I know we saved some of the site, luckily, before it went down.
[02:41:45.040 --> 02:41:46.040]  Can you put some of those up?
[02:41:46.040 --> 02:41:48.040]  Some of those graphics we've got just showing the different designs.
[02:41:48.040 --> 02:41:49.040]  Look at the pictures.
[02:41:49.040 --> 02:41:53.040]  All the family are buried under the house in there.
[02:41:53.040 --> 02:41:57.040]  Now, continuing with this, um, wow.
[02:41:57.040 --> 02:42:00.040]  So how many of these can you manufacture a day?
[02:42:00.040 --> 02:42:05.040]  Uh, if I really ramp it up two or three a day.
[02:42:05.040 --> 02:42:07.040]  Um, and, um, I'm ramping it up right now.
[02:42:07.040 --> 02:42:09.040]  I'll just put it that way.
[02:42:09.040 --> 02:42:11.040]  I can't tell you how many are in the ground where they're at.
[02:42:11.040 --> 02:42:12.040]  I mean, that's confidential.
[02:42:12.040 --> 02:42:13.040]  I wouldn't even tell you.
[02:42:13.040 --> 02:42:17.040]  It's just, um, I just hope I can meet the demand.
[02:42:17.040 --> 02:42:23.040]  And all this because you're a successful builder and you wanted one and they wanted to register you to get one.
[02:42:23.040 --> 02:42:26.040]  Well, that was part of the reason that there was other features.
[02:42:26.040 --> 02:42:28.040]  They only had one way in and one way out.
[02:42:28.040 --> 02:42:31.040]  Well, my shelters have one way in and two ways out.
[02:42:31.040 --> 02:42:32.040]  They have a back door.
[02:42:32.040 --> 02:42:35.040]  They have an escape tunnel that if somebody found your hatch and tried to block you,
[02:42:35.040 --> 02:42:38.040]  you could go out through a tunnel that comes out through the back of the shelter
[02:42:38.040 --> 02:42:41.040]  and comes up underground through what's called a reverse hatch that opens down
[02:42:41.040 --> 02:42:43.040]  and then you could dig your way up to the surface.
[02:42:43.040 --> 02:42:47.040]  So I wanted a way to escape if I got trapped.
[02:42:47.040 --> 02:42:48.040]  Well, that's why I like that.
[02:42:48.040 --> 02:42:52.040]  That's why I actually went to you is, is, is that I want to be able to defend it.
[02:42:52.040 --> 02:42:54.040]  And I know you have camera systems. You name it.
[02:42:54.040 --> 02:42:59.040]  But then there's also the fact is as you said, the escape hatch goes to where they don't know
[02:42:59.040 --> 02:43:01.040]  because there's a foot or so of dirt and grass.
[02:43:01.040 --> 02:43:03.040]  I mean, that's totally concealable.
[02:43:03.040 --> 02:43:07.040]  And if you ever use that, unfortunately, somebody's fighting for the life, you know,
[02:43:07.040 --> 02:43:11.040]  it may be you, it may be them, but it gives you a chance to defend yourself or escape.
[02:43:11.040 --> 02:43:14.040]  If somebody found your hatch and was trying to break into it.
[02:43:14.040 --> 02:43:18.040]  Now, the other thing, if somebody found the hatch between the hatch and the living quarters,
[02:43:18.040 --> 02:43:20.040]  there's a room, this airtight room.
[02:43:20.040 --> 02:43:22.040]  I call it the decontamination room.
[02:43:22.040 --> 02:43:25.040]  It's not truly a decontamination room where you go down there in a dress
[02:43:25.040 --> 02:43:27.040]  and get all the germs off and go through an air vent.
[02:43:27.040 --> 02:43:31.040]  It's actually, it's an airlock between the blast hatch and the living quarters.
[02:43:31.040 --> 02:43:35.040]  So if you had to run a generator down there, you could, or if you had dogs
[02:43:35.040 --> 02:43:38.040]  and they were going all over the place, you can put them in that room.
[02:43:38.040 --> 02:43:40.040]  See, that's another thing. Where are you going to bring your dogs?
[02:43:40.040 --> 02:43:42.040]  If you have to go down, you can leave your dogs up top.
[02:43:42.040 --> 02:43:44.040]  Well, I have dogs. I want to bring my dogs down.
[02:43:44.040 --> 02:43:47.040]  So I wanted to have a room where the dogs could live.
[02:43:47.040 --> 02:43:49.040]  And we're in there pooping all over the place.
[02:43:49.040 --> 02:43:52.040]  I can close the door and it's airtight on to smell there. You know what?
[02:43:52.040 --> 02:43:55.040]  So I added the decontamination room.
[02:43:55.040 --> 02:43:57.040]  I added the escape tunnel to the basic living quarters.
[02:43:57.040 --> 02:44:00.040]  And then I wanted storage, lots of storage.
[02:44:00.040 --> 02:44:02.040]  So I put three feet of storage underneath the floor.
[02:44:02.040 --> 02:44:06.040]  So when you're living in the shelter, you're not living among a bunch of boxes
[02:44:06.040 --> 02:44:08.040]  and water bottles and whatever.
[02:44:08.040 --> 02:44:10.040]  Everything is under the floor. It stays clean up top.
[02:44:10.040 --> 02:44:12.040]  So I like that.
[02:44:12.040 --> 02:44:15.040]  I like it too. That's why, so what happens?
[02:44:15.040 --> 02:44:17.040]  I guess you give them the specs that get shipped out here.
[02:44:17.040 --> 02:44:20.040]  And then I have to blast because of the Texas ground on the limestone.
[02:44:20.040 --> 02:44:25.040]  I've got 12 standard models of shelters anywhere from 20 feet up to 51 feet
[02:44:25.040 --> 02:44:30.040]  anywhere from $35,000 up to $86,000, which is my 51 footer.
[02:44:30.040 --> 02:44:33.040]  But another thing that's neat about the shelters, as you saw,
[02:44:33.040 --> 02:44:35.040]  they have a master bedroom on one end.
[02:44:35.040 --> 02:44:38.040]  You've got a 22 foot den in the middle of the kitchen.
[02:44:38.040 --> 02:44:41.040]  Then you've got private guest quarters and then you've got a private bathroom.
[02:44:41.040 --> 02:44:46.040]  So it feels more like a manufactured house than a pipe that I've turned into a bomb shelter.
[02:44:46.040 --> 02:44:52.040]  And you also found from the studies, this is what the government certified type of a metal.
[02:44:52.040 --> 02:44:55.040]  That way it's found even in blast. It moves.
[02:44:55.040 --> 02:44:57.040]  It's one of the strongest structures out there.
[02:44:57.040 --> 02:45:01.040]  I'm using galvanized corrugated pipe, the same stuff that runs under the highways.
[02:45:01.040 --> 02:45:06.040]  Now, the engineers testing shows that it's rated up to 42 feet of dirt cover.
[02:45:06.040 --> 02:45:08.040]  It's got up to a 200 year lifespan.
[02:45:08.040 --> 02:45:09.040]  But if you put it...
[02:45:09.040 --> 02:45:11.040]  And this system was what they used in the nuke testing.
[02:45:11.040 --> 02:45:12.040]  Tell me about...
[02:45:12.040 --> 02:45:13.040]  Yeah.
[02:45:13.040 --> 02:45:17.040]  Oak Ridge Laboratories in 1948 to 52, I believe it was,
[02:45:17.040 --> 02:45:20.040]  was doing the nuke testing out in the Nevada desert.
[02:45:20.040 --> 02:45:22.040]  Well, they had a crawl in something.
[02:45:22.040 --> 02:45:25.040]  So they buried galvanized culvert pipe and they went down there and set off the nukes.
[02:45:25.040 --> 02:45:28.040]  So as the ground slab came through, the shelter moved,
[02:45:28.040 --> 02:45:31.040]  but it's designed for earthquakes and movement.
[02:45:31.040 --> 02:45:33.040]  That's why they're designed the way they are.
[02:45:33.040 --> 02:45:35.040]  So they said, hey, this would make a great shelter.
[02:45:35.040 --> 02:45:38.040]  So they just took it and they put it underground and you crawl in the pipe.
[02:45:38.040 --> 02:45:42.040]  Well, I had the idea of just go ahead and put in the floors, laminate them,
[02:45:42.040 --> 02:45:46.040]  put removable center bores so you can put your food under the floor,
[02:45:46.040 --> 02:45:49.040]  put bunk beds in there, and then I started fancying them up.
[02:45:49.040 --> 02:45:51.040]  I said, you know what, if I'm going to use this on the weekends,
[02:45:51.040 --> 02:45:53.040]  I don't want to sleep with a bunch of other people.
[02:45:53.040 --> 02:45:56.040]  So I put a master bedroom on one side with the door and put the...
[02:45:56.040 --> 02:45:59.040]  Well, here's my thinking. Here's my thinking for it.
[02:45:59.040 --> 02:46:02.040]  Let's say there's a 20% chance there's going to be nuclear fallout
[02:46:02.040 --> 02:46:05.040]  from blowing up those reactors, which they admit when they blow the reactors up,
[02:46:05.040 --> 02:46:09.040]  it's going to make sure Noble and all of it with Fukushima look like child's play.
[02:46:09.040 --> 02:46:13.040]  And our media just raises the radiation level and says, what's safe now?
[02:46:13.040 --> 02:46:16.040]  I've actually looked, because I love my daughters and my son,
[02:46:16.040 --> 02:46:20.040]  ascending my wife for a year to the southern hemisphere.
[02:46:20.040 --> 02:46:23.040]  And I guess I'm just going to take one for the team and stay here.
[02:46:23.040 --> 02:46:26.040]  Cancer rates will go up if that nuclear physicist is gone,
[02:46:26.040 --> 02:46:29.040]  especially if you get a hot particle. That stuff blows around and around the world.
[02:46:29.040 --> 02:46:32.040]  That's why the northern hemisphere has more than doubled the radiation
[02:46:32.040 --> 02:46:36.040]  because of nuclear testing in the northern hemisphere in the last 60 years.
[02:46:36.040 --> 02:46:40.040]  So my issue is, especially in that first month, do I send them,
[02:46:40.040 --> 02:46:44.040]  get them on a plane and send them to the southern hemisphere?
[02:46:44.040 --> 02:46:46.040]  I guess something like Chile is what we're looking at.
[02:46:46.040 --> 02:46:49.040]  I'm serious. Chile is about the best in South America.
[02:46:49.040 --> 02:46:53.040]  Do I send my wife and kids to Chile, try to talk some family with going with them,
[02:46:53.040 --> 02:46:54.040]  so I can stay here?
[02:46:54.040 --> 02:46:55.040]  How are you going to get them back?
[02:46:55.040 --> 02:46:58.040]  Or do I, for a month, we go into the bunker?
[02:46:58.040 --> 02:47:01.040]  I mean, at least put them in there and they can, you know, because, I mean, it's serious.
[02:47:01.040 --> 02:47:04.040]  This is not a joke, but let's say it's more than 20% chance it's going to happen.
[02:47:04.040 --> 02:47:08.040]  My issue is, down the road, I sell my little farmhouse and everything.
[02:47:08.040 --> 02:47:12.040]  I see this as a major improvement with all sorts of folks that want a concealed,
[02:47:12.040 --> 02:47:15.040]  blast-proof bunker that's fully livable.
[02:47:15.040 --> 02:47:19.040]  I mean, I just see it as a win-win-win and I've decided to pull the trigger.
[02:47:19.040 --> 02:47:20.040]  Well, it's a long-term investment.
[02:47:20.040 --> 02:47:24.040]  Whether you use it or not, the shelter's going to last for many, many generations.
[02:47:24.040 --> 02:47:30.040]  So I think everyone that listens to your show would agree that something's coming down the highway one day.
[02:47:30.040 --> 02:47:34.040]  Have you ever asked him, do you think America will be here in 100 years?
[02:47:34.040 --> 02:47:36.040]  What's your thought on that?
[02:47:36.040 --> 02:47:38.040]  I mean, I get asked that and I'm like, well, I sure hope it is.
[02:47:38.040 --> 02:47:39.040]  I don't know.
[02:47:39.040 --> 02:47:42.040]  I just got guns, horrible food and all the rest of it and I'm drinking my own Kool-Aid here.
[02:47:42.040 --> 02:47:47.040]  I mean, look, I've got life insurance too, even though there probably won't be banks if it all collapses.
[02:47:47.040 --> 02:47:49.040]  Well, your shelter is your new life insurance.
[02:47:49.040 --> 02:47:53.040]  That's the kind of life insurance if you die, your family's taking care of.
[02:47:53.040 --> 02:47:56.040]  This is the kind of life insurance that keeps your family alive and you.
[02:47:56.040 --> 02:47:57.040]  No, I know.
[02:47:57.040 --> 02:47:59.040]  But I mean, I'm just here because it's interesting radio.
[02:47:59.040 --> 02:48:03.040]  I mean, again, I said, hey, let's have you on TV so you can answer my questions on air.
[02:48:03.040 --> 02:48:05.040]  You know, kind of kill two birds with one stone.
[02:48:05.040 --> 02:48:06.040]  I do that a lot.
[02:48:06.040 --> 02:48:08.040]  I promote whatever I'm looking at, whatever I think's interesting.
[02:48:08.040 --> 02:48:12.040]  And now, you know, you're here on this show.
[02:48:12.040 --> 02:48:15.040]  Once you're off, there's going to be a hundred questions that I had remembered.
[02:48:15.040 --> 02:48:19.040]  I wanted to ask you thinking about you coming into town, but here you are.
[02:48:19.040 --> 02:48:24.040]  The question I get asked the most, how long can I live in your shelter?
[02:48:24.040 --> 02:48:28.040]  Well, how long can you live in your house as long as the food and the water lasts?
[02:48:28.040 --> 02:48:29.040]  You can live in the shelter.
[02:48:29.040 --> 02:48:31.040]  And how claustrophobic is it?
[02:48:31.040 --> 02:48:34.040]  It's much more roomier than an RV.
[02:48:34.040 --> 02:48:37.040]  If you're living in an RV, those are what, seven and a half, eight feet wide?
[02:48:37.040 --> 02:48:39.040]  Well, this is ten feet wide.
[02:48:39.040 --> 02:48:42.040]  How long do I need to live down there if a bomb goes off?
[02:48:42.040 --> 02:48:44.040]  Well, it depends what kind of bomb it is.
[02:48:44.040 --> 02:48:46.040]  I answer those questions when we come back.
[02:48:46.040 --> 02:48:50.040]  And the website's down, folks, but eight, five, five, four bunkers is the number.
[02:48:50.040 --> 02:48:55.040]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why,
[02:48:55.040 --> 02:48:58.040]  even if I had a pretty good-sized meal that I was still starving.
[02:48:58.040 --> 02:49:03.040]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on
[02:49:03.040 --> 02:49:08.040]  in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost
[02:49:08.040 --> 02:49:13.040]  all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves,
[02:49:13.040 --> 02:49:15.040]  fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[02:49:15.040 --> 02:49:21.040]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity.
[02:49:21.040 --> 02:49:25.040]  The Young Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need.
[02:49:25.040 --> 02:49:29.040]  And once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.

[02:50:50.040 --> 02:50:53.040]  Hi there. My name is Frank Bates.
[02:50:53.040 --> 02:50:56.040]  I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.
[02:50:56.040 --> 02:51:03.040]  I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity monopolies
[02:51:03.040 --> 02:51:06.040]  and government agencies for what they really are.
[02:51:06.040 --> 02:51:12.040]  Incompetent line crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.
[02:51:12.040 --> 02:51:14.040]  Some have called this a conspiracy.
[02:51:14.040 --> 02:51:20.040]  Others have called it a cover-up and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.
[02:51:20.040 --> 02:51:28.040]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them and how you can beat them too.
[02:51:28.040 --> 02:51:34.040]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in the last three months.
[02:51:34.040 --> 02:51:40.040]  Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect your home.
[02:51:40.040 --> 02:51:46.040]  Go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down.
[02:51:46.040 --> 02:51:50.040]  Again, that's 123coverup.com.
[02:52:16.040 --> 02:52:33.040]  I'll be here till tomorrow and I'm heading back to California.
[02:52:33.040 --> 02:52:47.040]  You're here in Austin till tomorrow.
[02:52:47.040 --> 02:52:54.040]  The house is built on one side and I guess that is the only issue is you don't want to build a floodplain.
[02:52:54.040 --> 02:53:05.040]  The concern is the water table. You can't put a shelter in a water table. Since we dig a 21-foot hole and we put 12 inches of crushed gravel on the bottom for kind of like a leech field,
[02:53:05.040 --> 02:53:12.040]  and then we put the shelter in and 12, I mean 10-foot of dirt on top of it, we got to be able to dig down 21 feet and not hit a water table.
[02:53:12.040 --> 02:53:18.040]  Otherwise, you're going to have to go to what's called a watertight shelter, which I make those as well, but those are made out of smooth steel.
[02:53:18.040 --> 02:53:24.040]  Watertight is like a submarine. Submarine is watertight. You can submerge it and it won't leak.
[02:53:24.040 --> 02:53:30.040]  The galvanized corrugated pipe, those are what's called waterproof. That means you can get them wet, but they're not watertight.
[02:53:30.040 --> 02:53:35.040]  So if you submerge them, you can sprout some leaks. So when I have the pipe rolled from the manufacturer, I'm probably the only person that does this.
[02:53:35.040 --> 02:53:41.040]  I haven't squirt silicone in the joints. So it's waterproof as I can. So I'm trying to make it watertight.
[02:53:41.040 --> 02:53:46.040]  But if you put it where water's going to creak in, you can sprout a leak in a corrugated pipe shelter.
[02:53:46.040 --> 02:53:53.040]  So we have to have it looked at. I've also thought about just somewhere in the area buying another little piece of property that's high and then putting it in there.
[02:53:53.040 --> 02:54:01.040]  See, that's what we looked at because talking to Joel Scowles and their experts, they said, well, if you have to live closer into the city, then you've got a place that's really rural.
[02:54:01.040 --> 02:54:07.040]  And then that's where you put your hidden stuff. But then I'm concerned about getting there if all Hades breaks loose.
[02:54:07.040 --> 02:54:12.040]  Well, I mean, you can get there by bike or you can walk. I mean, you got to have a bug out plan.
[02:54:12.040 --> 02:54:19.040]  Sure, your house isn't that far from where we're at right now. So you can make it. I mean, a person can walk 40, 50 miles a day easy.
[02:54:19.040 --> 02:54:29.040]  It's just when you know something bad is happening, you need to get to that shelter quick before the civil unrest starts, which it will be within 48, 72 hours.
[02:54:29.040 --> 02:54:33.040]  No, I mean, I'm about 20 miles, I'm about 20 miles outside town.
[02:54:33.040 --> 02:54:35.040]  You can walk 20 miles.
[02:54:35.040 --> 02:54:44.040]  I know that my issue is if there's not a place there to stick one of these, then, you know, my issue is do I get a little piece of property in a farmhouse even further out the middle of nowhere?
[02:54:44.040 --> 02:54:47.040]  Because they say you want to be off the main roads and I'm pretty close to a main road.
[02:54:47.040 --> 02:54:51.040]  But then, then I guess I can bury a shelter out there because if you're...
[02:54:51.040 --> 02:54:57.040]  Well, I'd put you in one of my prepper communities that I'm starting, but I don't have one near Austin right now because of the limestone is so hard to dig in.
[02:54:57.040 --> 02:55:00.040]  So I'm looking towards West Texas where I can dig deep.
[02:55:00.040 --> 02:55:02.040]  You've already got one in what Arizona?
[02:55:02.040 --> 02:55:03.040]  Arizona.
[02:55:03.040 --> 02:55:04.040]  You won't say where?
[02:55:04.040 --> 02:55:06.040]  No, I can't tell anybody.
[02:55:06.040 --> 02:55:10.040]  You'd have to buy a shelter, then you'd have to be taken there by blindfold.
[02:55:10.040 --> 02:55:14.040]  And if you don't want to be part of it, you're not going to even know where it is to get back to it.
[02:55:14.040 --> 02:55:15.040]  You've got to leave your cell phones.
[02:55:15.040 --> 02:55:16.040]  There's no way to track it.
[02:55:16.040 --> 02:55:19.040]  I'm protecting the secrecy of my customers.
[02:55:19.040 --> 02:55:20.040]  There's no way I'm going to...
[02:55:20.040 --> 02:55:21.040]  You're an interesting guy.
[02:55:21.040 --> 02:55:22.040]  I've got to get...
[02:55:22.040 --> 02:55:24.040]  Wow, man, I tell you.
[02:55:24.040 --> 02:55:32.040]  Briefly, as we said we'd answer, and this hour is almost over, Mr. Hubbard, get into blast.
[02:55:32.040 --> 02:55:38.040]  Generally, what is it about a month and a half with the average hydrogen bomb that goes off that you need to stay underground?
[02:55:38.040 --> 02:55:46.040]  No, there's this 10-7 rule that every seven hours, 90% of the fallout is gone.
[02:55:46.040 --> 02:55:50.040]  So in 49 hours, 99% of the fallout is gone.
[02:55:50.040 --> 02:55:52.040]  So people say, how long do I got to stay underground?
[02:55:52.040 --> 02:55:53.040]  Is it two weeks?
[02:55:53.040 --> 02:55:59.040]  Well, if the fallout is 99% evaporated, you could come out in two days.
[02:55:59.040 --> 02:56:02.040]  I mean, Hiroshima is inhabitable.
[02:56:02.040 --> 02:56:05.040]  Nagasaki is inhabitable today because it's an airbus.
[02:56:05.040 --> 02:56:10.040]  So the fallout that went with the prevailing winds went out to sea, as far as I know.
[02:56:10.040 --> 02:56:14.040]  And people started living there right afterwards immediately.
[02:56:14.040 --> 02:56:17.040]  So it depends on the type of bomb that goes off.
[02:56:17.040 --> 02:56:19.040]  It depends on what you can do.
[02:56:19.040 --> 02:56:21.040]  All right, well, I got a lot of questions for everybody.
[02:56:21.040 --> 02:56:22.040]  I got to go shoot the nightly news.
[02:56:22.040 --> 02:56:23.040]  I've got another guest on.
[02:56:23.040 --> 02:56:25.040]  I tried to get you on that one.
[02:56:25.040 --> 02:56:27.040]  Thank you so much for spending time with us.
