[00:00.000 --> 00:13.640]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:13.640 --> 00:35.080]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen I told you
[00:35.080 --> 00:47.920]  that I saw all the signs I have been absolutely completely and totally worried in a giant way
[00:47.920 --> 00:58.280]  that the federal government was going to move under globalist control to restrict the second
[00:58.280 --> 01:06.760]  amendment and to basically instead of just trying to eat around the edges go for it all right now
[01:06.760 --> 01:13.760]  there are repeals in hundreds of newspapers police chiefs company heads members of Congress
[01:13.760 --> 01:18.360]  saying get rid of the second amendment outright they're not arguing that the second amendment
[01:18.360 --> 01:23.040]  didn't mean you could own guns like they used to do they're now saying let's just take the guns
[01:23.040 --> 01:31.800]  up at info wars dot com right now we have this article even without Congress Obama could act
[01:31.800 --> 01:36.960]  to restrict guns and no it's not the countless articles we've written the last four or five
[01:36.960 --> 01:43.080]  days since Friday's tragic events at Sandy Hook or the video I put out called the fixes in they
[01:43.080 --> 01:51.960]  are coming for our guns no that is a Reuters headline a Reuters headline I'm gonna say that
[01:51.960 --> 01:57.760]  again a Reuters headline that's what Bloomberg meant last Saturday when he said use executive
[01:57.760 --> 02:09.080]  power to take the guns this is Reuters ladies and gentlemen so now is the time for everyone to
[02:09.080 --> 02:15.160]  understand just how much trouble we're in before I get to all this news and I will be calm the
[02:15.160 --> 02:20.040]  second amendment's worth it I will break down the facts and give you a battlefield report on
[02:20.040 --> 02:26.120]  what's about to happen and we've got Larry Pratt who was on yesterday he went on Pierce Morgan it
[02:26.120 --> 02:32.320]  was unbelievable on the dwindling faltering state-run media of CNN he's gonna be popping in at the
[02:32.320 --> 02:38.600]  bottom of the hour to talk about the incredible lies of Pierce Morgan and Pierce Morgan was calling
[02:38.600 --> 02:44.240]  him a liar we're gonna go over the statistics of the doubling of violent crime conservatively in the
[02:44.240 --> 02:52.520]  15 years since England totally banned guns in the hands of citizens and we're gonna go over the FBI's
[02:52.520 --> 03:01.280]  own real crime statistics versus the hoax that you're seeing and the hoax that the media the
[03:01.280 --> 03:06.200]  controlled corporate media is putting out but I want to say this again they said before the
[03:06.200 --> 03:11.160]  election quietly that we're gonna use executive orders to get the guns Obama signed more executive
[03:11.160 --> 03:16.280]  orders and all presidents before him the first executive orders were how much money Congress
[03:16.280 --> 03:21.960]  allotted to Martha Washington on the plate she was gonna buy she could put on state dinners at
[03:21.960 --> 03:29.400]  the president's residence at that time in New York the president executes the laws now the president
[03:29.400 --> 03:39.160]  on war on taxes on cyber orders on power plants on everything is just signing orders in fact I meant
[03:39.160 --> 03:45.320]  to print this before well you guys type in ATF text public comment on shotgun ban because a bunch
[03:45.320 --> 03:54.080]  of newspapers will come up but there's the actual ATF filing last year late 2011 about 13 months
[03:54.080 --> 03:58.120]  ago where they just so we're just gonna ban most shotguns and then there was the Congress said no
[03:58.120 --> 04:03.000]  if there has to be a law so they backed off but that's the issue is that this is what they're
[04:03.000 --> 04:08.360]  moving towards a no-gun list where they just put you on an executive list as Rahm Emanuel called
[04:08.360 --> 04:13.520]  for there it is ATF to accept public comment proud outline shotguns folks people are saying
[04:13.520 --> 04:18.200]  how this will cause a civil war we've got articles where Mike Adams talked to a bunch of FBI and
[04:18.200 --> 04:22.680]  police he knows they're like well that'll cause a civil war they won't do it guys that's the plan
[04:22.680 --> 04:29.280]  okay and they're going to initiate it even if they think it's unpopular and will fail because
[04:29.280 --> 04:34.280]  they want to label gun owners as terrorists you've already seen that starting saying we're the clan
[04:34.280 --> 04:40.920]  we're terrorists kill us arrest us kill the NRA heads that's all in the news this is a plan to start

[08:58.360 --> 09:04.840]  would use executive orders and executive power to restrict the second amendment our so-called
[09:04.840 --> 09:09.880]  president very satara is speaking with biden right now going we need to be able to know if
[09:09.880 --> 09:14.760]  somebody's got a criminal record we need to have a background check he was just saying that before
[09:14.760 --> 09:19.560]  we went live here we're about to go to the feed when they do a total background check this guy
[09:19.560 --> 09:26.280]  had been refused not three not four but five times this guy was under psychiatric care undoubtedly
[09:26.280 --> 09:31.320]  on psychotropic but they were trying to keep that sealed this is incredible ladies and gentlemen
[09:31.320 --> 09:38.600]  they're creating a mass hoax and now roiders is reporting what bloomberg called for even without
[09:38.600 --> 09:46.360]  congress obama could act to restrict guns and they go on to announce that's what's set to happen i
[09:46.360 --> 09:52.040]  talked to a high level congressional source on monday who is going to get back with me and then
[09:52.040 --> 09:57.720]  it just got lost in the fog of war i need to call back and talk to that congress person i'll just
[09:57.720 --> 10:06.280]  leave it at that who said the word is that they are going to use executive power to go after the
[10:06.280 --> 10:12.680]  guns and that's why i told you that three weeks ago in the cover story in the magazine we already
[10:12.680 --> 10:18.040]  knew that that's what larry pratt said yesterday he's joining us again today to respond to the president
[10:18.040 --> 10:23.480]  and also pierce morgan trying to demonize him last night on the dwindling cnn but he's got biden
[10:23.480 --> 10:28.920]  with him and he says hey you got a right to have arms but we've got a right to take military style
[10:28.920 --> 10:35.080]  guns that's what he he's answering questions right now let's go to this disgusting uh press conference
[10:35.080 --> 10:45.240]  here it is somebody like me uh and what i said was that the ultimate package would involve a balance
[10:45.240 --> 10:53.720]  of spending cuts and tax increases that's exactly what i've put forward okay what i've said is is that
[10:53.720 --> 10:57.960]  so again he came out and talked about mass shootings and said we need to restrict the
[10:57.960 --> 11:05.000]  second amendment you know that you have a right basically to turn your guns in uh and that everybody
[11:05.000 --> 11:11.000]  agrees you don't need these military style weapons which is all semi-autos most guns and again guys
[11:11.000 --> 11:16.280]  will you print me that atf uh report i'm going to show that to folks where they say oh we're
[11:16.280 --> 11:24.200]  going to make a rule and ban 60 plus percent of all shotguns oh we're going to make a rule
[11:24.200 --> 11:32.760]  in any shotgun that semi-auto or a shotgun that could take a clip in the bottom uh not not by
[11:32.760 --> 11:43.080]  manufacture but a shotgun that can take a clip uh by the gun being uh changed converted you're
[11:43.080 --> 11:50.920]  going to have to turn that in not just that you can't buy them anymore or manufacture them or import
[11:50.920 --> 11:56.920]  them they're going to just take them and and here is Reuters and you guys monitor when he goes to
[11:56.920 --> 12:02.440]  gun questions tell me and we'll go back to him even without congress obama could act to restrict
[12:02.440 --> 12:11.080]  guns Reuters unburdened by reelection worries and empowered by law and that's a lie see they're
[12:11.080 --> 12:16.520]  trying to give him the cover to act without congress did you hear that why even have a congress
[12:16.520 --> 12:20.920]  see they're now saying oh we don't need congress to launch wars we don't need congress for cyber
[12:20.920 --> 12:24.920]  security acts take over the web we don't need congress to shut down power plants we don't need
[12:24.920 --> 12:30.600]  congress for carbon taxes see how more and more it's just act executively this is how
[12:30.600 --> 12:36.520]  dictatorship works by increment and and we've gone from the first executive orders look them up
[12:36.520 --> 12:43.320]  martha washington asking congress for money to buy a bunch of state china plates and cutlery
[12:43.320 --> 12:47.560]  to be able to have the french ambassador there that's one of the first executive orders we've
[12:47.560 --> 12:53.240]  done a report on it go look them up they're on the library of congress the first executive orders
[12:53.240 --> 13:00.520]  were george washington asking for the you know white house to be repainted to now hey congress

[24:22.600 --> 24:28.920]  notes on what he said and we do have a usa today report that has some of the quotes
[24:30.360 --> 24:34.440]  and obama has done what we knew he would do he is enlisting all americans to join him
[24:35.080 --> 24:42.040]  in a crusade against quote military style weapons that's almost all handguns and rifles they're saying
[24:42.680 --> 24:47.800]  only hunting stuff basically which is not what the second amendment is about okay so they're going
[24:47.800 --> 24:52.520]  with that like hey you got a right to have guns you can have that single shot shot gunner rifle
[24:52.520 --> 24:59.160]  we're taking everything else so we have this information he lists all the massacres with pleasure
[25:00.840 --> 25:06.360]  and he's willing to bet that's a quote that responsible gun owners don't want criminals to
[25:06.360 --> 25:11.160]  have weapons of war and then he went on to say there's no background check and we need a background
[25:11.160 --> 25:17.480]  check i mean wow really playing on the dumb public it's like they keep saying everybody's got machine
[25:17.480 --> 25:21.240]  guns nobody's got machine guns and machine guns hardly ever get used in crimes you got to jump
[25:21.240 --> 25:25.720]  through 100 hoops to get one and they give you a news flash they're not very good for killing people
[25:28.040 --> 25:32.280]  so the military goes to single and three burst but again these these anti-gunners
[25:32.280 --> 25:37.320]  they know that the general public that isn't into guns they count on them being ignorant
[25:37.320 --> 25:45.240]  and the gun culture was the top rated shows everywhere a and e discovery uh history just i
[25:45.240 --> 25:49.560]  never even watched television i turned it on and every show was people you know shooting guns and
[25:49.560 --> 25:54.680]  women getting into guns in every women's magazine i saw i mean even the local chronicle you see so
[25:54.680 --> 26:00.040]  they're panicking and they're pushing everything they've got and erin ran up to me and reminded me
[26:00.040 --> 26:05.400]  the 68 gun control act was pushed on the back of jfk being killed because why they could just buy
[26:05.400 --> 26:10.440]  a gun through the mail and of course lee harvey oswald could have walked into any shop without his
[26:10.440 --> 26:15.720]  name and just bought that rifle but no it had to be my mail so they could shut that down
[26:16.760 --> 26:22.280]  and then they couldn't pass it and so rfk got killed and it's now come out serhan serhan and
[26:22.280 --> 26:27.400]  mainstream news didn't shoot kennedy and the cia was there and we know the name of the cia agent
[26:27.400 --> 26:35.880]  asset that did it so the government did jfk and rfk and used it to pass the 68 gun control act
[26:36.840 --> 26:41.000]  and then crime rates exploded because citizens couldn't get guns then people started going
[26:41.000 --> 26:47.000]  through the hoops to get the concealed carry all the rest of it and crime rates have dropped and
[26:47.000 --> 26:52.840]  i'm going to go over that after larry pratt leaves us today i'm going to play the video and audio of
[26:52.840 --> 26:58.840]  him being attacked on pierce morgan while i show viewers the fbi's own statistics and then show you
[26:58.840 --> 27:07.400]  europe statistics and england statistics and mexico's statistics showing that as more as we got more
[27:07.400 --> 27:14.520]  guns crime went down not what pierce morgan is saying again it's all about perception just like for
[27:14.520 --> 27:18.920]  two years most people wouldn't go in the water because of jaws that came out in the early 70s
[27:18.920 --> 27:23.800]  and we have the newspaper articles i'm going to do another report on it showing where people would
[27:23.800 --> 27:28.040]  panic and not go in the water and beaches lost more than half their customers for at least two
[27:28.040 --> 27:33.720]  years they had to do psa saying there's not great white sharks here you know they kill a few people
[27:33.720 --> 27:41.560]  a year worldwide it's not a problem and it's the same mass hoax ladies and gentlemen 88 mass
[27:41.560 --> 27:50.040]  shoot people died this year in mass shootings 88 88 most of those were gang related but obama
[27:50.040 --> 27:55.400]  doesn't care you would think the end of the world happened because they show you the kids they use
[27:55.400 --> 28:01.240]  them they dangle them in front of you using their deaths to disarm this country and bring us all into
[28:01.240 --> 28:05.720]  the darkness of the mega cities where they've taken the citizens guns that have such high crime rates
[28:05.720 --> 28:11.720]  where the people are fed on they're going to lead and anti-gunner biden has been tapped to lead it
[28:12.920 --> 28:17.880]  we have a deep obligation all of us to try and end gun violence yeah they say never again there
[28:17.880 --> 28:23.720]  be any guns period in in in a shooting obama said at the white house this time the words
[28:24.840 --> 28:31.720]  need to lead to action and as reuters reported a bunch of republicans have lined up and said yep
[28:31.720 --> 28:38.680]  we're going to uh not just um put people on a no-gun buy list for no reason we need to shut down
[28:38.680 --> 28:44.680]  all sale of semi-autos and we need to turn them in you know that's reasonable you don't want to
[28:44.680 --> 28:49.400]  kill the kids do you time to turn your guns in you you have a right to a second amendment a right
[28:49.400 --> 28:54.840]  to turn them in it's here because folks they've already got it all your pension funds they're
[28:54.840 --> 28:59.080]  already all gone they're already gone just like europe they're going to implode this place totally
[28:59.080 --> 29:02.680]  and they want to be able to to come around just pick you up and take you to jail do whatever
[29:02.680 --> 29:07.720]  they want with you the police have been trained and hired to do body cavity searches of women you

[29:12.280 --> 29:17.080]  the feds are run by foreign banks we're going under full occupation now obama put an internet
[29:17.080 --> 29:22.040]  kill switch in congress wouldn't pass it mainstream news even said it was the end of internet freedom

[34:12.680 --> 34:16.680]  and we are bringing them down and we're going to get rid of their standard of living and we're
[34:16.680 --> 34:21.320]  going to sign their kids on to all of our debt and they've announced themselves world rulers
[34:21.320 --> 34:28.680]  we have an article titled bankers declare they've captured and conquered the united states in europe
[34:28.680 --> 34:39.560]  and it has dozens of links and video clips to them openly bragging in everyone's face
[34:40.760 --> 34:46.600]  that they have been able to do this now it's very simple the last thing they've got to get
[34:46.600 --> 34:50.840]  is our guns they're already announcing they'll take your property without due process they're
[34:50.840 --> 34:58.920]  already announcing the irs won't let you leave the country if they feel like it no judge no jury
[34:58.920 --> 35:03.320]  you just can't leave no judge no jury they just take your bank account they're going down a list
[35:03.320 --> 35:08.200]  of every basic liberty and getting rid of it they're going down a list of every tyranny and
[35:08.200 --> 35:19.880]  they're putting it in its place we historically know what this means we historically understand
[35:19.880 --> 35:32.920]  how tyrannies take over time and time and time again and we are now going into this system
[35:34.360 --> 35:44.760]  full bore and it is so painful to see the fact that our country has gotten to this point and is in
[35:44.760 --> 35:51.240]  the grip of hardcore mafia that is dangling 20 dead sad little children and their families
[35:51.240 --> 35:56.040]  and the sadness they're going through in our face to terrorize us and say you're not a good person
[35:56.040 --> 36:01.000]  if you don't turn your guns in you're not a good person if you don't go along with all of this
[36:01.800 --> 36:08.760]  you are a bad person if you don't submit to all of this tyranny
[36:08.760 --> 36:19.720]  I mean it is clear total in our face psychological warfare and it is being announced
[36:21.480 --> 36:29.000]  all over the news that they are going to come after our guns period
[36:31.400 --> 36:38.120]  this is the setup and they're not going to stop okay they've already gone for broke these are
[36:38.120 --> 36:43.720]  criminals and they're engaged in psych warfare and any of these businesses that say they're not
[36:43.720 --> 36:48.680]  going to sell guns well look it's walmart it's dicks it's these big globalist multinationals
[36:48.680 --> 36:53.480]  they're controlled by the mega corporations they're controlled by the mega banks they know
[36:54.680 --> 37:02.760]  what they're doing they know what their agenda is and again they have to kill the gun culture now
[37:02.760 --> 37:11.800]  because out of the gun culture the rest of the liberty culture is growing now on the larry
[37:11.800 --> 37:18.120]  practice you guys um i know he's trying to get through right now we'll go with phone anything
[37:18.120 --> 37:28.360]  we've got okay all right anyways uh he's not going to be able to be on soon is the issue
[37:28.360 --> 37:35.800]  because he's only had a 10 minute window i know that's because you know that's because we didn't
[37:35.800 --> 37:40.280]  tell him when we say we need to talk to larry bratt we have to tell them it's for the radio
[37:42.680 --> 37:49.320]  all right ladies and gentlemen again this is a very desperate time for our republic the most
[37:49.320 --> 37:55.640]  desperate it's ever been since our founding larry pratt joins us he was viciously attacked
[37:55.640 --> 38:01.480]  and called all sorts of names last night in in absolute demonization by a foreigner
[38:03.480 --> 38:08.600]  whose ancestors undoubtedly fought against this country trying to take our guns in 1776
[38:08.600 --> 38:13.240]  and told he was all manner of bad things and then pierce morgan put out a bunch of propaganda
[38:14.200 --> 38:18.120]  saying that you know crime rates went down when they took guns in england i have the statistics
[38:18.120 --> 38:22.040]  here while larry pratt talks i'm going to be showing you some of these headlines but larry
[38:22.040 --> 38:26.040]  thank you on short notice for coming on again today i just wanted to give you a chance to
[38:26.040 --> 38:32.200]  respond to what pierce morgan said uninterrupted uh here on air for a few minutes because he
[38:32.200 --> 38:38.840]  was talking over you the entire time alex it was um it was an extraordinary experience and here
[38:38.840 --> 38:46.440]  silly me i thought that the brits were such a staid the group of people uh but uh you saw it i
[38:46.440 --> 38:53.400]  guess uh that the guy melted down he absolutely couldn't get his head around the fact that people
[38:53.400 --> 38:59.320]  should be able to defend themselves and not wait for 20 minutes after they've been murdered for the
[38:59.320 --> 39:07.080]  police to arrive at that was just not something that fit inside his head and so he resorted to
[39:07.080 --> 39:14.280]  ed hominem and i thought at the time this is great this guy is exposing himself to the world
[39:14.280 --> 39:20.440]  that he's a loser that that's the best he can do that that's his idea of an argument he's lost all
[39:20.440 --> 39:28.280]  of the rational discussion can't compete in that arena so he resorts to name calling and i thought
[39:28.280 --> 39:36.520]  this is wonderful this is what i was this it doesn't get any better than this man you are right
[39:36.520 --> 39:43.880]  and and again i've never seen such demonization of gun owners like he was doing to you uh it's
[39:43.880 --> 39:48.680]  just amazing what do you make of obama's announcement and reuters saying that he's
[39:48.680 --> 39:53.880]  going to use executive orders and atf rules that's what you said yesterday was the route you thought
[39:53.880 --> 40:01.880]  they'd take it uh is the pattern that the president has shown that's the way he is conducting himself
[40:02.760 --> 40:09.640]  in his view evidently the fact that he barely got 50 plus percent of the vote means he can do anything
[40:09.640 --> 40:15.080]  he wants that he's not the president in a constitutional republic where the president
[40:15.080 --> 40:23.320]  can do certain things and most things the president cannot do according to the president's view now
[40:23.880 --> 40:31.000]  brock obama thinks he can do just about any bloody thing he can get away with and that's a gross
[40:31.000 --> 40:37.400]  misunderstanding of the office of president but it's apparently not the uh misunderstanding
[40:37.400 --> 40:43.320]  that a communist has and that's really the way the president thinks he was educated that way
[40:43.320 --> 40:51.720]  he is a full bore marxist and this guy is after and grabbing a hold of every bit of power
[40:52.280 --> 40:58.520]  and centralizing it in his hands and as he said even before the election we should have been
[40:58.520 --> 41:04.760]  listening if the congress won't go along with me then i'm just going to have to take action myself
[41:04.760 --> 41:12.600]  well hello mr dictator i guess you will what about the point that mexico has a total gun
[41:12.600 --> 41:17.800]  ban for citizens and has had 50 000 plus dead the last few years what about the fact that i mean
[41:17.800 --> 41:22.760]  england's crime rate doubled after they took guns i just showed their own numbers they're the most
[41:22.760 --> 41:27.240]  dangerous country in europe who's the safest switzerland with more guns per capita than we've got
[41:27.240 --> 41:35.080]  it does not compute that that just doesn't fit inside the cranium of the normal
[41:35.960 --> 41:45.880]  liberal thinker i was just being interviewed as you called in by pbs and it just it does
[41:45.880 --> 41:53.880]  not fit they cannot accept the idea that when you take guns away from decent people from the
[41:53.880 --> 42:01.320]  average citizen that things are they can't buy into the idea that things will get worse
[42:01.880 --> 42:07.400]  because their assumption is that you and i can't be trusted you and i are too juvenile you and i
[42:07.400 --> 42:13.640]  are too impetuous well perhaps what they're doing is projecting from themselves on to us
[42:14.200 --> 42:20.920]  and i i think a lot of the debate is to to point out to them hey guys we ain't like you
[42:20.920 --> 42:27.320]  we we really are different we can control ourselves we can control our tempers we can
[42:27.320 --> 42:33.080]  walk around with guns and we never shoot anybody our guns are safer than ted kennedy's car our guns
[42:33.080 --> 42:38.200]  kill fewer people than ted kennedy's car and they don't like to hear that of course larry
[42:38.200 --> 42:42.200]  pratt i know you've got to go and i appreciate the short notice i know you're working 18 hours a day
[42:42.200 --> 42:46.840]  right now to defend the republic gun owners dot org everybody should go immediately join at least
[42:46.840 --> 42:53.080]  sign up for the free email alerts and get active i want to though give you a chance to respond back
[42:53.080 --> 42:58.120]  here to pierce morgan anything you'd like to say to him because as you've been talking i've showed
[42:58.680 --> 43:03.400]  england's crime rate highest in europe 15 years after they banned guns from one of the safest
[43:03.400 --> 43:08.840]  countries in europe i've shown mexico after the gun ban most dangerous country in this hemisphere
[43:08.840 --> 43:15.800]  and i'm showing fbi dot gov statistics as gun ownership goes up the last 20 years but especially
[43:15.800 --> 43:22.440]  the last five crime rates plunging more than 20 percent just the last four or five years so here's
[43:22.440 --> 43:29.960]  the facts for pierce morgan on screen for people so what can we do rallying right now sir we're
[43:29.960 --> 43:36.600]  showing pierce morgan fbi dot gov crime rate violent crime rates plunging i've got hundreds of pages
[43:36.600 --> 43:42.200]  of this so there's your proof you're the liar or you're ignorant nothing against brits go back to
[43:42.200 --> 43:46.200]  your own country where they're you know may have hacking charges you know on him i guess he can't
[43:46.200 --> 43:50.520]  go back they may arrest him but what do you want to say to pierce morgan and closing and then what
[43:50.520 --> 43:55.960]  can we do to save the republic is this not the ultimate assault we're about to see start it looks
[43:55.960 --> 44:02.680]  like we are at least the where we were after columbine we managed to get through that but it
[44:02.680 --> 44:09.400]  was because the american people communicated with their politicians and said don't buy into the
[44:09.400 --> 44:19.080]  media lie if you vote to take my guns away if you vote to restrict my ability to get and to carry guns
[44:19.080 --> 44:26.120]  i'm coming for you in the next election they've got to understand that this is a career changing
[44:26.120 --> 44:31.560]  moment they're either going to be on the side of the republic or against it if they want to be with
[44:31.560 --> 44:39.480]  pierce morgan that's fine but just remember there will be consequences well that's the big problem
[44:39.480 --> 44:43.800]  i've talked to top election fraud experts like bev harris who's nonpartisan she said she's never
[44:43.800 --> 44:49.080]  seen this much fraud and most the fraud was against romney not that he was even good they the affix
[44:49.080 --> 44:53.640]  was in there too they stole the election that that's what i'm worried about larry there's so much
[44:53.640 --> 44:59.160]  election fraud now they're about to legalize the 30 million illegals but they know this is their last
[44:59.160 --> 45:03.960]  shot because america is starting to wake up i'm not just saying that but that's why we're in so
[45:03.960 --> 45:09.560]  much danger folks is because we can beat the collectivists and so now they are like cornered
[45:09.560 --> 45:15.240]  zombies that's right they they had to steal the last election or they could not have won and it's
[45:15.240 --> 45:22.200]  up to us to become part of the election machinery to become part of those officials that are sitting
[45:22.200 --> 45:27.000]  there it's a long day it's like five in the morning until seven eight at night maybe nine
[45:27.000 --> 45:34.040]  or ten at night it's a it's a killer day but it's either that or the republic take your choice well
[45:34.040 --> 45:37.880]  i'm gonna say this right now and everybody out there so many people i know including combat
[45:37.880 --> 45:43.800]  veterans say when they come from the guns i'm gonna go rambo folks let's go rambo in the info war
[45:43.800 --> 45:49.160]  going in the police stations with literature waking them up going to your city councils going to
[45:49.160 --> 45:55.080]  your state houses going to your media calling in to talk radio calling the winehouse calling the
[45:55.080 --> 45:59.400]  nra and saying you better not waffle because you know they're they're gonna give a press conference
[45:59.400 --> 46:04.920]  larry uh and and roiders is saying he may go dictator they're calling for him to use quote
[46:04.920 --> 46:09.640]  executive power and they're bragging that all these republicans are about to line up i've talked
[46:09.640 --> 46:13.960]  to some people on the hill i know you've talked to more the word is a bunch of republicans are
[46:13.960 --> 46:19.720]  gonna are gonna go with this because of campaign donations uh can we hold the line or will these
[46:19.720 --> 46:26.200]  traders sell us out larry is this it well that's the issue you put your finger on it and it's up
[46:26.200 --> 46:33.080]  to us to make our voices heard if they realize that they may be hearing something on cnn it
[46:33.080 --> 46:40.760]  appears morgan but if they hear something uh many times uh more coming from their grassroots
[46:40.760 --> 46:47.160]  they're going to realize that uh the media is talking to itself and they better not go with
[46:47.160 --> 46:52.200]  the media because the media is not going to protect them when we come to vote that's right
[46:52.200 --> 46:58.120]  god bless you gun owners dot org folks uh they don't pay me say this uh though i'd love to get
[46:58.120 --> 47:05.160]  them as a sponsor ladies and gentlemen you are insane if you don't go sign up for a membership
[47:05.160 --> 47:09.240]  or a lifetime membership or if you don't go at least sign up for the free email alerts and they
[47:09.240 --> 47:15.480]  will give you up to the minute if the nra was half as good as goa we would not be in the situation
[47:15.480 --> 47:21.480]  the nra supported the 68 gun control act in closing how do people go and sign up to be
[47:21.480 --> 47:25.480]  members or how do they just flat out donate larry well you've told them that gun owners
[47:25.480 --> 47:30.840]  dot org is the easiest way if they can't get on the web it's triple eight double eight six guns
[47:30.840 --> 47:37.960]  eight eight eight six g uns but gun owners dot org is certainly the easiest now listen you're kind
[47:37.960 --> 47:43.000]  of the opposite of me and not in politics when it comes to your demeanor but but i mean i
[47:43.000 --> 47:48.120]  wear my emotions but also my brain when i thought about on my sleeve i think about things coldly
[47:48.120 --> 47:52.280]  but then i get on air and then you know get hyped up because that's just how i am because this
[47:52.280 --> 47:57.400]  politics is war but we love you alec but but but larry you're somebody i know you got to go that
[47:57.400 --> 48:04.680]  always kind of downplace things just because you're the calm cool collected guy how bad is it i mean
[48:04.680 --> 48:08.600]  i'm here saying i've never seen anything like this my gut tells me but also politically
[48:08.600 --> 48:14.760]  red alert i mean is this death con one i mean is this like red alert sir yes sir it is as bad as
[48:14.760 --> 48:21.720]  it was after columbine we were looking at a situation where gun control legislation looked to be
[48:21.720 --> 48:28.440]  inevitable well it wasn't and it wasn't because we stood up and we told the politicians go back in
[48:28.440 --> 48:35.640]  your hole don't even think about it or else you're not going to be around after the next election
[48:35.640 --> 48:41.000]  and that's what we need to tell them absolutely the only problem is we now clinton was leaving
[48:41.000 --> 48:47.640]  office we now have obama not facing reelection for horrible cold years and he's talking about
[48:47.640 --> 48:51.480]  executive action in the media is telling him go ahead and do it we'll give you cover i think
[48:51.480 --> 48:56.120]  this is worse i think this is the worst we've ever faced it could be uh it certainly we've
[48:56.120 --> 49:01.320]  got a guy that doesn't seem to have any scruple about doing anything no matter how illegal
[49:01.320 --> 49:07.320]  and so it's up to us to put the heat primarily on the republicans in the house and to tell them
[49:08.120 --> 49:15.880]  cut off the money because if there's no money for these rascals no money for these dictators
[49:15.880 --> 49:21.160]  they don't volunteer they'll go away and undoubtedly sir is it not dictatorship when
[49:21.160 --> 49:29.720]  the media says become a dictator oh uh when the media is applauding it makes it very likely
[49:29.720 --> 49:36.520]  that they're going to think this is my moment well it may be their moment to be defeated if we
[49:36.520 --> 49:43.960]  keep our wits about us and we uh don't fall for the inevitability notion that they're trying to
[49:43.960 --> 49:51.080]  give us that somehow this is uh something that we can't stop i heard that message before over
[49:51.080 --> 49:56.760]  ten years ago after columbine that's right and it wasn't inevitable gun owners dot or g i know
[49:56.760 --> 50:01.000]  you've got to go thank you for the time god bless you larry pratt you too alex thank you that's the

[55:02.520 --> 55:07.480]  crazy now i want to play about four minutes from piers morgan before we go to break and come back
[55:07.480 --> 55:15.160]  with breaking news with the head of oathkeepers while piers morgan is calling larry pratt a liar on
[55:15.160 --> 55:20.280]  communist news network last night while this foreigner nothing is foreigners but i mean don't
[55:20.280 --> 55:25.240]  come to my country and tell me give up my rights especially when i had a war with your king over
[55:25.240 --> 55:31.480]  this 200-something years ago punk kind of a touchy subject red coat won't you get out i'm a country
[55:31.480 --> 55:38.680]  you and ferried zarkaria get out get out you bilderberg crash excuse me get out of my country
[55:38.680 --> 55:46.040]  scum while he's talking while he's talking while he's talking i'm going to be showing statistics
[55:46.040 --> 55:50.280]  where their crime rate exploded in england highest in europe ever they took the guns and how our
[55:50.280 --> 55:56.280]  crime rate is dropping guns are saving this country and they are taking each little crime making it
[55:56.280 --> 56:01.240]  huge on the news to give you the perception just like jaws made people think there were great
[56:01.240 --> 56:07.560]  whites eating everybody five great white deaths a year not real folks this isn't real
[56:09.000 --> 56:14.360]  but start playing this piece of trash here it is i think we need to ban gun control laws that
[56:14.360 --> 56:20.520]  keep people from being able to protect themselves the the problem is not going to go away if we
[56:20.520 --> 56:25.960]  banned this or that gun we've tried that that doesn't work doesn't even work in england you've had
[56:25.960 --> 56:30.840]  mass murders there all over europe there have been mass murders the solution is for people
[56:30.840 --> 56:36.600]  to be able to defend themselves at the point of the crime and not wait for 20 minutes for the
[56:36.600 --> 56:43.400]  police to come after everybody's death the prat was an absolute lie the gun murder rate in countries
[56:43.400 --> 56:50.440]  like britain or germany or australia who've all suffered massacres many years ago similar nature
[56:50.440 --> 56:58.520]  have they they are 35 people killed your your murder rate has your murder rate is lower than ours
[56:58.520 --> 57:07.240]  that is true you're violent crime rate they had a violent crime rate is higher than ours
[57:07.240 --> 57:15.000]  as is the violent crime rate in australia america is not the the wild west that you are depicting
[57:15.000 --> 57:21.320]  we only have the problem in our cities and and unhappily in our schools where people like you
[57:21.320 --> 57:26.920]  have been able to get laws put on the books that keep people from being able to defend themselves
[57:26.920 --> 57:32.680]  i honestly don't understand why you would rather have people be victims of a crime than be able
[57:32.680 --> 57:36.840]  to defend themselves it's incomprehensible you're not believed would be stupid man aren't you
[57:38.040 --> 57:43.080]  it seems to me that you're morally obtuse you seem to prefer being a victim to being able to
[57:43.080 --> 57:48.600]  prevail over the criminal element and i don't know why you want to be the criminal's friend what
[57:48.600 --> 57:53.880]  a ridiculous argument you have absolutely no coherent argument whatsoever you don't you don't
[57:53.880 --> 57:57.960]  actually give it you don't give a damn do you about the gun murder rate in america you don't
[57:57.960 --> 58:02.280]  actually care all you care about it seems to me that facts don't bother you do they mr morgan

[01:00:52.520 --> 01:01:01.560]  cause just randomly we are entering authoritarianism but the gun culture laid down by our forebears in
[01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:08.520]  a fight against the red coats is now reactivating and is the number one shows all over tv and
[01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:13.640]  you look at the top 10 shows on cable half of them are gun shows everybody's getting into guns i
[01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:18.840]  told you we've been winning culturally but the empire was going to strike with everything they've
[01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:27.480]  got and some stations don't carry this segment so whatever our guest talks about i want him to
[01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:35.080]  recap afterwards but i tell you my wife tells me she's never seen me this area she's never seen
[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:41.000]  me work this much i've been working from like six in the morning until about midnight uh she says
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:47.720]  she's never seen me uh not smile and it's because folks my gut and intellectually i know they're
[01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:52.600]  coming down with both feet the whole future our country everything is going to be governed here
[01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:57.720]  and all of you out there that think that you are just going to turn your guns in or you don't have
[01:01:57.720 --> 01:02:03.160]  guns you idiots they're going to take everything they want the guns because that because they want
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:09.160]  to do stuff so bad they know with their computers that can predict future events in mass movements
[01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:13.000]  they admit this that there's going to be a resistance and we're going to win so they want
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:17.960]  to trick us into turning our guns in kind of like our forebears will do the native americans
[01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:21.720]  turn your weapons in we'll be your friends you were really done to do that you're going to
[01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:26.280]  a reservation if you get up but we're going to shoot you folks i'm not going to turn them in
[01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:31.880]  okay let me tell you this isn't just some garden or a variety tyranny the globalist are the nastiest
[01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:37.160]  the world's ever seen they put linen stolent mount and hitler in on record congressional hearings
[01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:43.160]  the church hearings the other the attacks free foundation hearings on it stir it rose we're
[01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:48.520]  going to break here in a minute well i obviously i want your take on all this but i mean we knew
[01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:52.760]  it was coming because the globalists like to brag but they're going to move with an executive order
[01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:58.520]  or just atf rules and it looks like they may order semi-autos actually turned in if they think they
[01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:04.200]  can get away with it stewart yes this is what we knew was was going to happen ever since the
[01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:12.040]  heller decision which left the door open to what the court called you know reasonable restrictions
[01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:16.840]  on the types of firearms that's why that was actually a defeat for the second amendment
[01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:23.000]  the second amendment was exactly about military weapons that's the whole point is to preserve
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:29.080]  the military capacity of the american people and so when they tell you we're not disarming you
[01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:34.680]  really can take away your assault rifles your your military vehicles that is exactly what the second
[01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:39.160]  amendment was meant to protect and so it is an attempt to disarm us this is going to be the
[01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:45.160]  fight that's right we come back i want to recap all that but switzerland we're modeled if you people
[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:49.320]  this history off switzerland and the netherlands the netherlands has since gotten rid of their local
[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:54.920]  militias but for those that don't know switzerland is modeled off of a 400 year old model in the
[01:03:54.920 --> 01:04:00.280]  netherlands pirates would come in and raid the incredibly lucrative wealthiest shipyards in the
[01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:05.400]  world so that the the locals organized armed with their own cannons their own little fortresses
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:11.560]  their own weapons the militia that was then picked up by the swiss that's where we got it and the
[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:17.400]  whole thing is about we are the military clearly that there was a whole point it was that was the
[01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:21.560]  founder's answer to that ancient question that who should guard the guardians is that the people
[01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:26.840]  themselves are the militia they are the military force inside the united states they're supposed
[01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:34.200]  to be capable of of resisting invasion of overthrowing the insurrectionists anybody
[01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:38.280]  want to commit an insurrection and for executing the law of the union you're not capable of doing
[01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:43.160]  that unless you have military arms that's the whole point it's like trench cock that the
[01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:49.640]  county fathers said he said the congress has no power to disarm the militia their swords and every
[01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:54.600]  of the terrible implement of the soldier are the bird flight as an american the unlimited power
[01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:58.840]  to stay there and what the full quote when we come back that's right the birthright is military arms

[01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:43.800]  these meetings and i've been in these meetings over the last 10 years so when i say i've turned
[01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:49.720]  down 10 i mean with contracts they're like oh you won't take $300,000 for the first season i know
[01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:53.240]  that's not a lot but most people don't get paid their first season the second it could be you
[01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:57.880]  know millions like you know jesse james don't you want to be like jesse james i'm like well no i
[01:11:57.880 --> 01:12:01.560]  actually know jesse james by the way he says he'll come on the show the point i'm not name dropping
[01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:08.040]  either it's just all ridiculous the point is is that people think i'm joking about that i think
[01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:12.920]  it's time to drop the hammer just get those folks on the point is is that i've been in these meetings
[01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:18.440]  offered it and didn't do it because they can control it but even when they were controlling it
[01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:22.440]  i remember five six seven years ago they were going we know guns are the hottest thing we've
[01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:27.480]  done focus groups we've done test we know it'll get top ratings they won't let us well finally the
[01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:35.720]  damn broke and all they you you see television all it is is gun shows now and the power structure
[01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:40.840]  is like we're gonna lose it all because guns are american culture you're the military you're the
[01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:48.840]  civil defense and i showed last hour the fbi's new crime statistics or 21 years crime has been
[01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:53.560]  dropping but most of it in the last five since gun ownership went totally insane and i'm going to
[01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:57.960]  show you the 20 year graphs the six year graphs the three year graphs if you're watching on info

[01:13:03.320 --> 01:13:11.000]  dot gov they get on the news and they hoax you and they lie to you and they tell you that there's
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:16.200]  an epidemic of crime well it's an epidemic when one child gets kidnapped and killed you know they
[01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:20.680]  say ban electrical tape when somebody uses that to kill a little kid put over their nose and mouth no
[01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:26.680]  is did the electrical tape do it no the point is is that some crazies always on psychotropic
[01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:31.080]  in every case i've seen go out and do this and they pick victim disarmament zones that have
[01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:35.880]  been advertised of why do you kill yourself i can go aim a gun at a cop or rob a bank no
[01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:40.760]  go out big and infamous you know you're a you're a drughead on anti psychotic medication that
[01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:46.600]  makes you psychotic it says on the insert what is the media advertise public schools you go there
[01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:51.640]  there'll be nobody with guns you can go in and take out a couple classes for the cops get there
[01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:56.760]  when the cops get there they either shoot themselves or aim the gun at the cop and wait the police
[01:13:56.760 --> 01:14:01.880]  will tell you in every case because it's a sicko type which by the way fits mind control programming
[01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:07.480]  you can say they're either program which we know somewhere or or it's just cultural programming
[01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:12.520]  but that's what manchurian candidates do after they commit a bunch of crime they dispose of
[01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:19.320]  themselves it's called disposal mechanism but regardless of that they are canceling top-rated
[01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:25.880]  shows that make millions of dollars a week i happen to know what these shows make millions
[01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:33.400]  a week a top-rated show on discovery channel can make five million dollars in one night
[01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:37.240]  guess how much one of those shows cost to make about five hundred thousand dollars
[01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:43.080]  they're biggest ones a million some of them a hundred thousand ladies and gentlemen they just
[01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:48.200]  turned loose of hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars at discovery alone and their entire

[01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:51.000]  for the rest of the bill of rights the fourth fifth and sixth amendments in particular the
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:55.320]  anti gunners are going after the second amendment with the vengeance and as you said earlier it's
[01:16:55.320 --> 01:17:01.480]  not just democrats you've got uh is it peter king from new york you've got these horrendous you know
[01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:09.320]  so-called republicans really um pardon yes exactly they're all you know and they're buying the same
[01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:15.320]  line of nonsense that the democrats are selling is that will assault weapons is not really protected

[01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:41.160]  force of the nation uh a really good quote was from founding father trench cox who said
[01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:47.560]  the power of the sword and this is even speaking in favor of the new constitution back in 1788
[01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:53.080]  that the power of the sword says the minorities in the hands of congress my friends and countrymen
[01:17:53.080 --> 01:18:00.120]  is not so but the powers of the sword and the hands of the humanry of america from 16 to 60 the
[01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:05.480]  militia of these free commonwealths entitled and accustomed to their arms when compared with any
[01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:12.120]  possible army must be tremendous and irresistible who are the militia are they not ourselves is it
[01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:17.000]  feared then that we shall turn our arms each man against his own bosom congress has no power to
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:22.200]  disarm the militia there's swords in every terrible implement of the soldier of the birthright of
[01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:26.840]  americans the unlimited power of the sword is not in the hands of either the federal or state
[01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:32.200]  governments but where i trust in god it will always remain in the hands of the people so anybody

[01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:37.000]  taking guns off the shelf all these conservatives so-called conservatives who are now willing to
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:42.440]  put guns on the table and talk about assault his band these are people who never understood the
[01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:47.720]  right to bear arms never understood the constitution never understood liberty in the first place and
[01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:54.280]  so this is going to be a dividing issue among the the political right in this country the so-called
[01:26:54.280 --> 01:27:00.920]  political right and said fine we'll find out who is resolute and who is not anybody who will who
[01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:08.360]  will count how to be disarmament fanatics is somebody who you should not support whether
[01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:13.960]  they're in politics whether they're in business you need to the name the name should be mud to you
[01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:17.960]  talk about your pledge i agree we'll talk about a strategy to defeat these enemies and they are
[01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:23.240]  authoritarian enemies folks but but but what is your pledge well my pledge is my personal
[01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:28.200]  pledge of resistance against any attempt to disarm us i said look here's the situation
[01:27:28.200 --> 01:27:32.440]  my conscience and urgency of our current situation compel me to speak out
[01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:38.360]  i stewart rhodes an american as a military veteran and as a father pledge the following
[01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:43.720]  i've pledged to never disarm and in particular to never surrender my military pattern semi-automatic
[01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:48.760]  rifles and the full capacity magazines parts and ammunition and go with them regardless of what
[01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:54.440]  illegitimate act is taken by congress the president or the courts i also pledge to pass on those military
[01:27:54.440 --> 01:27:59.480]  pattern rifles to my children and my children's children as well as the full capacity magazines
[01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:03.880]  parts and ammunition they need to make them run regardless of what illegitimate action is taken
[01:28:03.880 --> 01:28:08.920]  by congress the president or the courts and then i quote founding father trench cox about the power
[01:28:08.920 --> 01:28:13.880]  of the sword being in the hands of the people every every terrible implement of the soldier is
[01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:19.320]  their birthright and i say that that power of the sword and those terrible implements of the soldier
[01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:26.120]  include their battle rifles their battle carbines or m1a's or fnl ar's 1891's their grand's ak's
[01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:31.400]  ar's all the weapons listed as being targeted for feinstein's so-called assault of his band
[01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:35.720]  the whole point of the second amendment is to reserve the military capacity of the american
[01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:39.960]  people and remember they would never say they wanted them even though they're on records
[01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:43.320]  saying they were gonna ban them when we would try to build support they would go we'll never
[01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:48.920]  take them that's a conspiracy theory they use military terminology of we're not assaulting you
[01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:53.880]  or like attacking during the tete holiday i mean everything they do is military these are not just
[01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:59.240]  dumb liberals stewart why do they want our guns well they want us to be defenseless and and their
[01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:04.760]  their eventual goal is complete disarmament they will tell you well sure we're not going to disarm
[01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:08.920]  you because we're going to get any assault weapons and the next thing will be there'll be the scoped
[01:29:09.560 --> 01:29:14.840]  bolt action which they'll call sniper rifles and the next thing will be what was dangerous handguns
[01:29:14.840 --> 01:29:19.960]  you don't need a handgun like that to go duck hunting you'll be reduced down to a single shot
[01:29:19.960 --> 01:29:26.280]  shotgun or a 22 like in england and then they'll say well we're not disarming you we're just asking
[01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:30.600]  you to keep them down locked up the local gun range you can go ahead and go down there and
[01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:35.080]  target participants in a while or check one out to go duck hunting then you got to return it back
[01:29:35.080 --> 01:29:40.760]  to the lock to save at the gun range and you're still not disarmed and then they ban fox hunting
[01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:45.320]  and now they're banning duck hunting and they're doing it all over the world meanwhile the elites
[01:29:45.320 --> 01:29:50.040]  are all exempt from this we'll be right back to finish up your pledge and i'm gonna pledge with you

[01:33:14.520 --> 01:33:19.000]  on our first lot of other breaking news while we're busy focused on their attack on our second
[01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:26.040]  amendment they're covering up Benghazi where they admit tens of thousands of missiles including
[01:33:26.040 --> 01:33:32.120]  heat shakers to shoot down aircraft shoulder fired were given to the rebels to be brought into
[01:33:32.120 --> 01:33:37.720]  syria the rebels are al-qaeda so our government that's an article we got to do that nobody's done
[01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:46.280]  our government the obama administration is giving missiles anti-aircraft guns military
[01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:53.720]  weapons that we can't even get stuff that'll shoot down you know your passenger jets all day long
[01:33:54.760 --> 01:34:04.520]  they're giving them that they're giving them that and then covering it up while saying we
[01:34:04.520 --> 01:34:10.360]  should turn in our semi-automatic rifles and shotguns you notice obama's like we want to
[01:34:10.360 --> 01:34:15.640]  ban the assault weapons but also handguns because they do and that's true that's actually most of
[01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:20.680]  the crime so see the assault rifles aren't even used in hardly i have the fbi statistics here
[01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:27.480]  we're gonna go over some of those the toll-free number to join us is 800 25 at 9 9 231 800
[01:34:27.480 --> 01:34:35.720]  25 at 9 9 231 if you go to drudgereport.com the irony is not lost on drudge british host
[01:34:35.720 --> 01:34:42.120]  slams americans for guns says we should turn them all in and it shows a continental army person
[01:34:42.120 --> 01:34:47.400]  and uh you know basically fighting back against the british redcoat and again nothing against
[01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:50.840]  the british people i mean a lot of my ancestors come from there paul watson's a great patriot
[01:34:51.400 --> 01:34:55.080]  most the british parliament was against the war it's not an anti you know british thing it's just
[01:34:55.080 --> 01:35:02.360]  that this guy's a slimy globalist here in our country telling us that we should turn our guns
[01:35:02.360 --> 01:35:08.360]  in and it's truly uh disgusting so that's up at drudgereport.com and we're also making some of
[01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:12.760]  our own graphics showing him you know basically dressed up like the king of england next to obama
[01:35:12.760 --> 01:35:17.960]  and others we're gonna be putting up on info wars.com and prisonplanet.com it is so important right
[01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:22.760]  now ladies and gentlemen to understand that this is maker to break at time you either get really
[01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:29.400]  aggressive politically or you lose everything because again if they just took the guns yeah crime
[01:35:29.400 --> 01:35:35.240]  rates explode uh i'm not going to follow it anyways i live in texas i'm going to defend myself
[01:35:35.240 --> 01:35:39.240]  see because it's not that i'm living in fear i've it feels really good knowing i've got guns in my
[01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:44.200]  house and knowing the crime rate is incredibly low where i live some of the lowest in the country
[01:35:44.200 --> 01:35:50.040]  where i live because of the fact that criminals don't break in your house and we have the fbi
[01:35:50.040 --> 01:35:55.480]  statistics we're going to show on that appears morgan and i want to get uh stewards take on that
[01:35:55.480 --> 01:36:00.120]  plays on the general public's ignorance because there is a perception that crime has gone up
[01:36:00.120 --> 01:36:06.920]  there's one type of crime that has gone way up petty crime where they know that the general public
[01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:12.840]  doesn't have guns your car parked with uh your purse in the front seat of your stereo
[01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:17.800]  when they see there's nobody there you leave your garage open uh you know your purse while
[01:36:17.800 --> 01:36:22.680]  you're at a restaurant you go to the bathroom that stuff's off the chart because criminals now are
[01:36:22.680 --> 01:36:29.400]  scared but all other violent crime home invasions i've got the statistics here they are plunging
[01:36:29.400 --> 01:36:35.240]  now steward i i notice you also pledge to give aid to your friends and neighbors that you pledge to
[01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:40.440]  defend the republic talk more about what you pledge i defined it i just had it here we'll
[01:36:40.440 --> 01:36:44.520]  put it up on screen because i want to pledge with you i want to say here on air i think i'm
[01:36:44.520 --> 01:36:49.640]  going to make a video about this that i pledge to never turn in my lawful illegal firearms that
[01:36:49.640 --> 01:36:55.080]  this is all the hoax and i pledge to expose the illegitimate occupational government we have
[01:36:55.080 --> 01:37:01.480]  that openly isn't becoming a dictatorship and i pledge my my name my treasure my honor my family
[01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:06.120]  to it you know i've pledged to call for secession to reconstitute the republic
[01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:10.440]  and that got a lot of national attention because i knew this was coming but but i agree it's time
[01:37:10.440 --> 01:37:17.720]  for police military uh you already saw that state judge uh which is like the you know mayor out
[01:37:17.720 --> 01:37:23.320]  midland come out and say that you know the county judge that we know they're coming for the guns
[01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:28.600]  and we ought to find that clip i mean people know what's coming and now it's here and like you said
[01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:33.800]  they want to just try to slip it in steward where oh it's not an attack we're just gonna take your
[01:37:33.800 --> 01:37:38.920]  guns oh look the republicans agree all right you know the stores quit selling them the shows aren't
[01:37:38.920 --> 01:37:43.560]  on now the culture's dirty and bad they actually said that uh foxes announced they're not going to
[01:37:43.560 --> 01:37:49.800]  show christmas uh shows that showed children in school just showing children in school i'm not
[01:37:49.800 --> 01:37:55.880]  kidding folks that's mainstream news that's improper now in fact i'm gonna go out to my
[01:37:55.880 --> 01:37:59.640]  truck during the next break and pull that article and actually show people no you can't even show
[01:37:59.640 --> 01:38:04.040]  children in school they're pulling shows because just children in schools too frightening for us
[01:38:04.040 --> 01:38:09.080]  it's this ninny thing of mind control while the people running this are arming terrorist
[01:38:09.080 --> 01:38:14.600]  murdering people all over the world spying on us running the drugs into the country they're trying
[01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:20.920]  to just absolutely put us under mind control so stir it finish up your pledge and then let's get
[01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:26.520]  into uh pierce morgan and then some phone calls uh read the whole thing or just the highlights
[01:38:27.640 --> 01:38:31.640]  i mean just the end part uh read wherever you want go ahead i mean you've got about halfway
[01:38:31.640 --> 01:38:34.840]  through it yeah the whole point of second amendment is preserve the military capacity
[01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:40.040]  of american people to preserve the ability of the people who are the militia provide for their own
[01:38:40.040 --> 01:38:44.920]  security as individuals as neighborhoods towns counties and states during any emergency man
[01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:50.440]  made or natural to preserve the military capacity of american people to resist tyranny and violations
[01:38:50.440 --> 01:38:54.840]  of their rights by oath breakers within government and preserve the military capacity of the people
[01:38:54.840 --> 01:38:59.560]  will defend the constitution against all enemies both foreign domestic including those oath breaking
[01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:04.680]  domestic enemies within government is not about hunting that's core the second amendment is also
[01:39:04.680 --> 01:39:09.320]  not really even about self-defense against private criminals it's about self-defense against public
[01:39:09.320 --> 01:39:15.720]  criminals against tyrants reciprocers and foreign invaders above above all of the firearms currently
[01:39:15.720 --> 01:39:21.320]  available to american citizen modern military pattern semi-automatic rifles provide that military
[01:39:21.320 --> 01:39:26.920]  capacity protecting and keeping enduring such arms of military utility as the heart and soul
[01:39:26.920 --> 01:39:32.920]  of second amendment thus any attempt to ban their possession sale purchase or transfer is an attempt
[01:39:32.920 --> 01:39:37.720]  to disarm the american people that's the biggest point i want to make is that this is disarmament
[01:39:37.720 --> 01:39:43.960]  you don't wait for them to get to your bolt action or your 22 or your handgun you stop them
[01:39:43.960 --> 01:39:49.320]  and try and take away your battle rifle because the most effective weapon you own right now
[01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:55.880]  they've been able to freeze our our technological capacity for self-defense at like 1934 levels
[01:39:55.880 --> 01:40:00.600]  while they continue to to progress with with predator drones everything else so one one thing
[01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:08.200]  we should not do is give up the last you know mediocre and limited capacity we still have
[01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:12.120]  our military capacity is supposed to be a lot stronger than this but we the people have a lot
[01:40:12.120 --> 01:40:17.560]  of atrophy and a lot to litter away so we cannot back up any further we must be willing to be
[01:40:17.560 --> 01:40:24.040]  resolutely stand and say we will not comply we will we will nullify as individuals as communities
[01:40:24.040 --> 01:40:32.040]  as states we will refuse to obey and we will resist including mutual defense let me just
[01:40:32.040 --> 01:40:38.040]  read from the hill house dim turn in your guns this is the woman that put tsa on the buses and
[01:40:38.040 --> 01:40:42.920]  highways in houston sticking hands down pants and searching bags without warrants until the

[01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:10.040]  an appropriate response to last week's mass shooting in newtown yeah so the psychopaths can
[01:41:10.040 --> 01:41:15.800]  kill us i would this is a quote i would personally just say to those who were listening maybe you
[01:41:15.800 --> 01:41:22.040]  want to turn in your guns jackson lee sat on the house floor oh no i'm not going to take your guns
[01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:27.240]  say that sigh up but look at what dick sporting goods did they wanted to be part of the solution
[01:41:27.240 --> 01:41:32.360]  and part of america oh see if you're part of america you turn your guns in dick sporting goods
[01:41:32.360 --> 01:41:36.440]  announced this week that it would stop selling and displaying and a lot of stores are just pulling
[01:41:36.440 --> 01:41:41.720]  guns entirely walmart says they may just pull everything they pulled rifles semi autos this
[01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:47.640]  is unbelievable that's the hill uh i mean i mean this is unprecedented how they want to create
[01:41:47.640 --> 01:41:54.440]  this illusion that america just decided it was time to turn their guns in sturd well here that's
[01:41:54.440 --> 01:42:00.360]  one half of america the other half of america is now uh more resolute than ever i think the
[01:42:01.240 --> 01:42:07.400]  attempt to repeat the assaultless ban will have a very different outcome i think the the mindset
[01:42:07.400 --> 01:42:13.720]  of gun owners that i know anyway have hardened considerably the last assault was banned was
[01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:19.960]  ridiculous it was insulting it was a gross violation of our rights and i think the attitude since then
[01:42:19.960 --> 01:42:26.120]  has changed quite a bit we'll have more resistance and frankly i think it'll spark a civil war i think
[01:42:26.120 --> 01:42:30.760]  that when they try to do this if they if they're successful like the mealy mouth republicans go
[01:42:30.760 --> 01:42:39.320]  along with us go along with this kind of stuff they will place us um at april 19th 1775 that's
[01:42:39.320 --> 01:42:44.280]  where we're going to be and all it will take is the first gun owner who fights back and it'll kick
[01:42:44.280 --> 01:42:50.440]  off and it'll be a spiral from there and perhaps one i don't know sure i will agree with you that
[01:42:50.440 --> 01:42:53.800]  i think that they probably do want that because if you look at all the military training now
[01:42:53.800 --> 01:42:58.760]  civilian inmate labor camps training to cordon cities the army manuals training to confiscate
[01:42:58.760 --> 01:43:03.400]  guns in america they've trained the military what i found it's done is actually woken up the
[01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:07.880]  military that heard me you know 15 years ago in the air and thought this is extreme i've talked to
[01:43:07.880 --> 01:43:12.440]  so many active do they say no that's what woke us up because what we're taught now is what you said
[01:43:12.440 --> 01:43:17.800]  what happened same thing with police i do you know see all more and more of them waking up they
[01:43:17.800 --> 01:43:21.720]  don't care they just get rid of them and bring in you know total authoritarians or people that'll
[01:43:21.720 --> 01:43:28.280]  follow orders but we've seen miscalculations you know in the documentaries and in congressional
[01:43:28.280 --> 01:43:35.320]  hearings on waco massacre in in in 93 we know that atf went to raid they found a group that was
[01:43:35.320 --> 01:43:39.720]  weird found a group doing some strange stuff they exaggerated a lot of it but i'm not
[01:43:39.720 --> 01:43:44.440]  defending what the dividends were doing they went in found a multiracial group called them racist as
[01:43:44.440 --> 01:43:50.280]  well uh opened fire on them dividends fought back so then they surrounded them burned them down so
[01:43:50.280 --> 01:43:54.920]  the dividends did it but the there's footage of the atf loading their cameras and it came out in
[01:43:54.920 --> 01:44:00.840]  hearings later in their own internal documents that they were going to go kill those people call
[01:44:00.840 --> 01:44:07.240]  them a cult and use that as the kickoff of ruby ridge to start disarming americans and just calling
[01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:12.360]  everyone a terrorist who wouldn't but that rollout didn't work so they kind of went with the mcvee
[01:44:12.360 --> 01:44:16.600]  thing that didn't work too well so they went with muslim terrorists in the next staged event now
[01:44:16.600 --> 01:44:21.000]  they're going back to patriots doing it what is it about the globalist because they're smart to a
[01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:26.200]  point but a lot of things they do don't they get that people now know they're staging stuff
[01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:30.440]  don't they get people now know sir hand sir hand was staged in rfk to get the uh
[01:44:31.240 --> 01:44:37.560]  68 act passed don't they know they're not operating in a vacuum now because they've got to know it will
[01:44:37.560 --> 01:44:44.680]  cause a civil war and they've got to know they're going to lose uh your take on that steward well
[01:44:44.680 --> 01:44:50.680]  i mean they're they're they're syops work on a large percent of the population you can look at the
[01:44:50.680 --> 01:44:56.760]  you know more of a mainstream reaction of course it's what they show you on tv but the syops as
[01:44:56.760 --> 01:45:02.360]  you've said don't work on a very significant portion and that's the freedom movement which is
[01:45:02.360 --> 01:45:06.600]  growing by leaps and bounds and it's growing within the ranks of the military and police also
[01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:12.280]  the police and rank and file the military rank and file no firearms this is the great weakness
[01:45:12.280 --> 01:45:17.000]  is that these guys understand firearms they understand what's necessary to save your own
[01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:22.600]  life and some of the attacking you and so they're not going to buy it um their their sell out perfume
[01:45:22.600 --> 01:45:29.160]  princess you know commanders might you know the generals who sold out the the state police chiefs
[01:45:29.160 --> 01:45:33.400]  and and you know the ones they parade in front of the camera might have sold out but the rank
[01:45:33.400 --> 01:45:39.160]  and file have not and they understand the reality of violence they understand the necessity of being
[01:45:39.160 --> 01:45:44.280]  armed and they're not going to buy it and so now you're going to have a problem and they think that
[01:45:44.280 --> 01:45:47.640]  they're going to go along with it but i think a large percentage of them will not there's going
[01:45:47.640 --> 01:45:53.400]  to be a division within the ranks and this only helps us this actually helps us quite a bit because
[01:45:53.400 --> 01:45:58.760]  all those guys come back from iraq and afghanistan and they have an m4 in their closet the semi-automatic
[01:45:58.760 --> 01:46:03.720]  version what they carry in iraq and afghanistan as far as they're concerned that's their rifle for
[01:46:03.720 --> 01:46:08.920]  their life you know forever to defend themselves and they're not going to turn them in and the guys
[01:46:08.920 --> 01:46:13.960]  who are still in have the same mindset about their personal weapons and so they've kind of created
[01:46:13.960 --> 01:46:19.480]  their own worst enemy in many ways which is why they're so afraid of veterans yeah for those that
[01:46:19.480 --> 01:46:23.320]  don't know sometimes people email me and go i thought you were making it up when you said
[01:46:23.320 --> 01:46:27.800]  veterans were the number one terrorist and that 90 percent of homeland security preparation is to
[01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:32.040]  fight veterans i thought you were making it up that the explorer scouts are training to go door
[01:46:32.040 --> 01:46:36.680]  to door and take guns i went and saw it in the new york times i went and saw the documents you got
[01:46:36.680 --> 01:46:43.000]  it's true yeah that is crazy that homeland security is really for veterans but it's not when you
[01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:49.880]  understand homeland security is a foreign occupying force and that's why i'm telling people they have
[01:46:49.880 --> 01:46:55.400]  looked at the metrics they know the liberty movement is winning and that's why they've had to steal
[01:46:55.400 --> 01:47:00.520]  elections that's why they've had to claim there's a mandate for socialism that's actually a desperate
[01:47:00.520 --> 01:47:07.080]  attempt to hoax us into their control uh and the globalists don't care if cops and police die
[01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:12.280]  try to take our guns so you need to understand folks it looks like a civil war maybe what they're
[01:47:12.280 --> 01:47:18.120]  planning and look how right we've been so far so heaven help us ladies and gentlemen we have
[01:47:18.120 --> 01:47:24.680]  got to get in their face and let them know we're not putting up with it and you've got to melt
[01:47:24.680 --> 01:47:30.840]  republican house phone numbers and tell them listen i'm going to campaign against you full
[01:47:30.840 --> 01:47:35.240]  time or i'm going to run against you if you don't stop this traitorous garbage and where are the
[01:47:35.240 --> 01:47:39.000]  republicans with the fbi crime statistics i'm going to show those we're going to break and
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:44.360]  come back and take calls where are they showing that for 20 years crime rates violent crime has
[01:47:44.360 --> 01:47:48.840]  been plunging and home invasions have been plunging and then you can go to the fbi has
[01:47:48.840 --> 01:47:53.400]  interactive maps of every state in every city and wherever there's gun control is where you have the
[01:47:53.400 --> 01:47:58.840]  high crime i'm going to show people watching on tv some of this but radio listeners just go to fbi.gov
[01:47:58.840 --> 01:48:04.120]  type in violent crime statistics uh stirrick talk about that while i show people these documents
[01:48:05.320 --> 01:48:09.880]  well a big point i want to make is that it's like you said that these republicans are not
[01:48:09.880 --> 01:48:15.080]  defending you like they should they should be going on the attack they should be calling this
[01:48:15.080 --> 01:48:22.120]  what it is a disgusting blood dancing manipulation of the population and taking advantage political
[01:48:22.120 --> 01:48:28.200]  advantage of the of the tragic death of children they should be calling this out but instead they're
[01:48:28.200 --> 01:48:33.160]  going along with it they're saying oh yes things have changed now it's like 9 11 things have changed
[01:48:33.160 --> 01:48:38.120]  we've got to go along with with sacrificing our rights because the death of 20 people you know
[01:48:38.120 --> 01:48:44.440]  27 people outweighs the rights of all of us and our posterity and our defense against a limited
[01:48:44.440 --> 01:48:49.480]  government and so we need to call them out you know one of one part of my pledge is that i pledge
[01:48:49.480 --> 01:48:55.800]  that i will will oppose and purge out of office anybody of any party who votes for this nonsense
[01:48:55.800 --> 01:49:01.240]  i don't care if you're told that the lesser two evils from now on the name is mud you should
[01:49:01.240 --> 01:49:06.120]  purge them out and the only way you're ever going to avoid having to fight another civil war in this
[01:49:06.120 --> 01:49:11.560]  country is if you make it very clear that you are no longer going to support outbreakers if they
[01:49:11.560 --> 01:49:16.520]  if they violate their oath by voting for this nonsense or otherwise violate their oath like for
[01:49:16.520 --> 01:49:21.880]  the ndaa and things like that you should not support them you cannot say you're keeping your
[01:49:21.880 --> 01:49:26.600]  oath to defend the constitution while also voting for an outbreaking politician and the reason why
[01:49:26.600 --> 01:49:31.160]  you're not defending the constitution is because when they violate their oath by passing assault
[01:49:31.160 --> 01:49:36.600]  with this ban they will compel us to fight that'll be it there'll be no more election cycle three or
[01:49:36.600 --> 01:49:42.120]  four years down the road to try to fix things by voting in supposed uh conservatives and then
[01:49:42.120 --> 01:49:47.160]  saying well we'll get to them later on this is it folks if you don't stand hard now and let them
[01:49:47.160 --> 01:49:51.320]  know that you will not support them ever again if they vote for this they will vote for it because
[01:49:51.320 --> 01:49:55.480]  they know you'll vote for them anyway if you tell the oath breakers will vote for you because
[01:49:55.480 --> 01:49:59.320]  they're the lesser two evils why should they not vote for it exactly let's be clear the same
[01:49:59.320 --> 01:50:03.960]  goldman sex jp morgan gang was taken down europe and others they're the number one givers to
[01:50:03.960 --> 01:50:09.720]  anti-gun stuff they're financing these republicans they're not doing that they know it's a psi op
[01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:15.240]  they know all this gun turning in business is just meant to be a hyped up deal but they want to move
[01:50:15.240 --> 01:50:21.160]  up the ranks they want power just like bainer boner is up there saying okay we'll accept all of
[01:50:21.160 --> 01:50:27.080]  obama's tax increases because he was put in there as a globalist protogé of newt genrich who wrote
[01:50:27.080 --> 01:50:31.960]  the forward to alvin hired e toffler's books calling for world government and in planning
[01:50:31.960 --> 01:50:37.240]  you and your family with microchips i mean these are these are authoritarian globalists

[01:55:31.080 --> 01:55:39.560]  of the primary targets from what i understand is going to be guys on a cyclist that uh the
[01:55:39.560 --> 01:55:45.560]  military is that's right and they put people on that by the millions made up and there no they've

[01:55:55.960 --> 01:56:05.800]  my kid brother is still in and he's a high ranking uh enlisted uh in the army and uh he has told me
[01:56:05.800 --> 01:56:16.040]  emphatically that they uh as soon as uh things go from bad to worse uh they've got the u n and
[01:56:16.040 --> 01:56:24.360]  nato forces both posed and ready to move in on this country no no that's in le09 that's in the
[01:56:24.360 --> 01:56:29.880]  washington post see people don't get this it's official they're going to use foreign troops on us
[01:56:29.880 --> 01:56:37.720]  uh steward roge you've got any comments on that well it's exactly why one of our top 10 orders
[01:56:37.720 --> 01:56:44.680]  we will not obey is any orders to assist in the use of foreign troops in american soil um but
[01:56:44.680 --> 01:56:49.800]  frankly i hope you try because that'll do that'll be the thing that gets most americans off the fence
[01:56:49.800 --> 01:56:55.400]  in fact it was the british bringing in the germans that finally turned the tide in 1777
[01:56:55.400 --> 01:57:01.240]  that's correct the use of the hessians is what did it um and and that happened before it's one
[01:57:01.240 --> 01:57:07.000]  of the reasons why people switched their their thinking from reconciliation to independence
[01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:13.240]  because in 1775 before the declared independence a lot of them were still thinking about reconciling
[01:57:13.240 --> 01:57:17.880]  when they brought the hessian mercenaries through new jersey and they raped and pillaged and burned
[01:57:17.880 --> 01:57:23.240]  their way through that's what ticked off a lot of the americans and said okay that's it we're
[01:57:23.240 --> 01:57:27.880]  going to declare independence and it said what happened again um i hope they do that if they're
[01:57:27.880 --> 01:57:32.600]  going to use force against us i hope they bring in foreign troops and u n troops i really did yeah
[01:57:32.600 --> 01:57:36.280]  that's well listen that's what they're preparing for like at some u n operation and what they don't
[01:57:36.280 --> 01:57:40.440]  get is that will be an incredible propaganda defeat for them but that's what i mean they're so
[01:57:40.440 --> 01:57:45.320]  disconnected and they're so glad i see all the liberal side saying let's bring in u n troops
[01:57:45.320 --> 01:57:50.680]  let's arrest alec shone's i even have quotes today i haven't gotten to they like fantasize and and and
[01:57:50.680 --> 01:57:56.840]  these hollywood guys got on msnbc last week harry bellifante and said obama could just be a dictator
[01:57:56.840 --> 01:58:02.680]  and arrest the right wingers i mean they they really are fantasizing about how they're going to come
[01:58:02.680 --> 01:58:06.760]  arrest us and put our backs against the walls what do they think's going to happen once that starts
[01:58:06.760 --> 01:58:11.880]  steward we're just going to sit there and bend over they think so and they think the military
[01:58:11.880 --> 01:58:16.840]  police are going to go along with it um they're full of hubris they're full of false pride and
[01:58:16.840 --> 01:58:20.840]  they don't understand their own vulnerability what does your brother say caller is he gonna go along

[02:02:36.440 --> 02:02:41.880]  to this fellow well no this could do what you're doing and and what he what he said is mirrors
[02:02:41.880 --> 02:02:47.400]  what i've heard across the board also is that in many military units they're having these discussions
[02:02:47.400 --> 02:02:52.600]  they're paying attention and this is the this is the great um victory we have and in the internet
[02:02:52.600 --> 02:02:58.600]  the freedom of speech on the internet and on on radio is what's turning the tide and the powers that
[02:02:58.600 --> 02:03:02.920]  being known that and it's turning the tide in the ranks but i would just encourage people to really
[02:03:02.920 --> 02:03:08.760]  focus the liberty movement needs to focus on the guys with the guns it is so incredibly important
[02:03:08.760 --> 02:03:15.160]  you might not get a chance to vote for rand paul in 2016 stop looking only at politics
[02:03:15.160 --> 02:03:20.040]  focus on the guys with the guns i just urge you i don't care if you do it through oathkeepers or
[02:03:20.040 --> 02:03:26.920]  how you do it hand out dbds uh turn them on to your radio show whatever it takes wake them up

[02:08:49.880 --> 02:08:56.360]  staring us right off a cliff and i declare war on these people i declare info war on them and if
[02:08:56.360 --> 02:09:03.240]  you will simply start attacking them you didn't realize this this is like putting crosshairs
[02:09:03.240 --> 02:09:09.880]  on somebody and pulling the trigger politically when you expose there a bunch of zombies vampires
[02:09:09.880 --> 02:09:16.360]  using dead children to take our guns when they're about your warmongering criminals like obama
[02:09:17.160 --> 02:09:23.000]  walter jones congressman said he's guilty of war crimes yesterday on this show he is under law
[02:09:24.040 --> 02:09:30.280]  funding al qaeda hey obama you're gonna cry for all the mexican kids killed by fast and furious
[02:09:30.280 --> 02:09:36.520]  you did as a false flag to blame the second amendment get back in their dirty face get back
[02:09:36.520 --> 02:09:41.400]  in their face and stop being cowards oh they may put me on a list they may come get me folks if you
[02:09:41.400 --> 02:09:47.320]  give into that fear it's over i'm all in i'm with stewart rhodes i will never submit to the new world
[02:09:47.320 --> 02:09:53.400]  order i will never go along with them i stand against them no matter what happens and they can
[02:09:53.400 --> 02:09:58.120]  kill us individually they can politically destroy us they can assassinate our character but it's
[02:09:58.120 --> 02:10:04.360]  still a fraud god knows who you really are and they can kill your body but they can't kill your soul
[02:10:04.360 --> 02:10:10.040]  and they can't kill your ideas like v says after they just sprayed him with bullets and he's got the
[02:10:10.040 --> 02:10:17.160]  bad guy the dictator he's got him right there and he says flesh and blood can die but ideas ideas
[02:10:17.160 --> 02:10:24.520]  are bulletproof and that's when you really start living is when you step across from the fear and
[02:10:24.520 --> 02:10:31.800]  step into an idea that's what life's all really about because these globalists are the scum of the
[02:10:31.800 --> 02:10:37.640]  earth and they are scared of you you have power they tell you you don't have power all day they're
[02:10:37.640 --> 02:10:41.400]  trying to break your will i want to jam it a bunch of calls in the final segment with stewart
[02:10:42.200 --> 02:10:46.520]  he's got some ideas to counter this and turn this around we're going to put out here as well but
[02:10:46.520 --> 02:10:52.360]  i want to play this clip of tom head out in what is it midland one of the most popular cities out
[02:10:52.360 --> 02:10:56.840]  in west texas who said a few months before the election he said look they're gonna probably put
[02:10:56.840 --> 02:11:02.120]  obama in he's gonna come through the guns and try to bring the un in that's an oversimplification but
[02:11:02.120 --> 02:11:06.680]  and people are going to resist there's going to be a civil war i need deputies to stand up against the
[02:11:07.240 --> 02:11:13.720]  un occupied federal government and folks that's because that's a big city out there
[02:11:13.720 --> 02:11:19.320]  a good size town that's because they're telling him this that's why the the police are on tape on
[02:11:19.320 --> 02:11:24.920]  the tv show nodding their heads with them yes yes that's right because folks as crazy as it sounds
[02:11:24.920 --> 02:11:29.560]  the globalists really think they're going to take over america bankrupt things and put us in
[02:11:29.560 --> 02:11:36.520]  reeducation camps like harry balafonte said last week on uh al sharpton show on on on msnbc
[02:11:37.240 --> 02:11:40.360]  and you're like well that'll never happen here really obama health care never happened here
[02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:46.040]  53 million abortions will never happen here it's all the nsa never spying without warrants here
[02:11:47.160 --> 02:11:52.600]  the tsa never be on highway checkpoints now training the police they're allowed to go in your body
[02:11:52.600 --> 02:11:58.040]  in a non-emergency situation just as a routine track it's traffic stop now the state police of
[02:11:58.040 --> 02:12:03.160]  texas are starting this because the feds told them they could do it i mean it's it's it's
[02:12:03.160 --> 02:12:08.200]  we're already in the caroling but there's still the old republic left the stigial parts of it
[02:12:08.200 --> 02:12:13.560]  we can reignite those and restore the republic here's that quick clip he's going to try to hand
[02:12:13.560 --> 02:12:19.000]  over the sovereignty of the united states to the un okay what's going to happen when that happens
[02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:23.800]  i'm thinking worst-case scenario right right i understand civil unrest civil disobedience
[02:12:23.800 --> 02:12:29.640]  civil war maybe and we're not talking just a few riots here in demonstrations we're talking
[02:12:30.200 --> 02:12:36.280]  we're talking lexington concord take up arms and get rid of the guy okay now what's going to happen
[02:12:36.280 --> 02:12:42.680]  if we do that if the public decides to do that he's going to send in un troops i don't want them in
[02:12:42.680 --> 02:12:47.400]  luba county okay so i'm going to stand in front of their first armored personnel carriers and say
[02:12:47.400 --> 02:12:51.560]  you're not coming in here and the sheriff i've already asked him i said you're going to back me
[02:12:51.560 --> 02:12:57.800]  said yeah i'll back you well i don't want a bunch of rookies back there turn i want trained he quit
[02:12:57.800 --> 02:13:03.560]  that's enough easing he goes on to say that he wants a tax increase to create a larger county
[02:13:03.560 --> 02:13:08.760]  militia he's just call out a posse and train him that'd be free basically the local restaurants
[02:13:08.760 --> 02:13:12.600]  will provide all the food and stuff and and and prepare and people go that well that's crazy you
[02:13:12.600 --> 02:13:18.040]  know that's america what sounds crazy because we've been domesticated is america we should be forming
[02:13:18.040 --> 02:13:22.200]  counties and cities saying we don't care if you announce we're under world government we're not
[02:13:22.200 --> 02:13:29.080]  going along with this okay it's now time to say the people are awakening or it's all the way
[02:13:29.080 --> 02:13:34.520]  sturt roads comments to this and we're going to go back to calls well he's right and and and the
[02:13:34.520 --> 02:13:39.240]  thing that you can always point to is look as you were saying earlier you know the NSA is spying
[02:13:39.240 --> 02:13:45.080]  on americans that is not something that's that's you know only a future possibility
[02:13:45.080 --> 02:13:50.600]  obama does have a kill list of american citizens who's going to kill he has already killed american
[02:13:50.600 --> 02:13:55.080]  citizens he has claimed the right to kill american citizens they've claimed the right to apply the
[02:13:55.080 --> 02:14:00.600]  laws of war to you um not just through the ndaa but even before that they've done this and so
[02:14:00.600 --> 02:14:04.360]  these are things that are not conspiracy theory i mean this this is why i found an oath keeper
[02:14:04.360 --> 02:14:10.920]  that realized how close we were to going down the same path as not to germany and we're on it
[02:14:10.920 --> 02:14:16.280]  and they've gotten rid of they've pretty much gutted the rest of the bill of rights the fourth
[02:14:16.280 --> 02:14:23.160]  death and six amendments are for all intents and purposes dead and what's left is simply to
[02:14:23.880 --> 02:14:29.480]  disarm you and then go ahead and use the infrastructure they've already created that
[02:14:29.480 --> 02:14:35.480]  they they've made very plain it's right there in your face in the law right there in the executive
[02:14:35.480 --> 02:14:40.440]  orders admitted in court things that they've already done and so now they're just you know this is the
[02:14:40.440 --> 02:14:45.720]  next step is to disarm you if you let them disarm you you should have fought back you should have
[02:14:45.720 --> 02:14:50.840]  resisted during the bush years when the neocons were gutting the bill of rights the name of the
[02:14:50.840 --> 02:14:55.640]  war on terror but you didn't stand up then so now you're going to have to stand up when they're
[02:14:55.640 --> 02:15:00.760]  coming for your guns that's what it takes like i said last week if that's what it takes and bring
[02:15:00.760 --> 02:15:06.440]  it on if this is what it takes to wake up conservatives to finally purge out the oath breakers
[02:15:06.440 --> 02:15:11.080]  within their own party this was so disgusting about it is like you you saw what happened at the
[02:15:11.080 --> 02:15:16.360]  rnc i was there like watching a nuremberg rally they're cheering for john mccain a friggin traitor
[02:15:16.360 --> 02:15:21.160]  to the constitution who wrote the detention provisions of the ndaa the man should be hanging
[02:15:21.160 --> 02:15:26.600]  from a noose after being tried and convicted of treason and being executed that's what he deserves
[02:15:26.600 --> 02:15:31.960]  but instead he gets a standing ovation from republicans and so it's disgusting that they have
[02:15:31.960 --> 02:15:37.640]  let the constitution be destroyed so much that the last thing that's left the last impediment
[02:15:37.640 --> 02:15:44.040]  the total tyranny is still the second amendment and so now are they going to fight for it we'll see
[02:15:44.040 --> 02:15:48.120]  the republicans in congress i don't think they will unless you hold their feet to the fire
[02:15:48.120 --> 02:15:52.840]  make it clear that you're going to purge them out but i'm not even sure it might be too late for that
[02:15:52.840 --> 02:15:56.600]  they might still go ahead and go along with it because you have voted for them in the past
[02:15:56.600 --> 02:16:02.040]  this is why i'm so upset with people who are otherwise good americans who continued to vote
[02:16:02.040 --> 02:16:08.360]  for oath breakers because they were afraid as you said earlier you cannot let fear drive you
[02:16:08.360 --> 02:16:14.760]  and if you're someone like my friend sheriff mac unfortunately who voted for romney and supported
[02:16:14.760 --> 02:16:19.880]  romney out of fear of obama that's the reason why we're in the situation where we are now
[02:16:19.880 --> 02:16:25.400]  we may have to fight because people let their fear drive them into violating their principles
[02:16:25.400 --> 02:16:31.320]  and voting for oath breaking republicans who are now in office still sitting there reelected
[02:16:31.320 --> 02:16:36.920]  who are going to go along with his crap so we have to stop that that's our last possible chance
[02:16:36.920 --> 02:16:43.800]  is to purge the oath breakers out of office from both sides republicans and democrats
[02:16:43.800 --> 02:16:49.080]  purge them out this is what jefferson and madison did back in 1798 against alien sedition acts i
[02:16:49.080 --> 02:16:55.640]  agree i agree we do not have a garden variety corruption either we have the nastiest dehumanizing
[02:16:55.640 --> 02:17:01.640]  eugenics based system folks these are people that want world government to kill you and i saw a
[02:17:01.640 --> 02:17:05.960]  youtube comment today i meant to print it but only printed part of it guys can you go find this and
[02:17:05.960 --> 02:17:10.520]  expand the comments i get the full comment because these here here i'll give it to you because these
[02:17:10.520 --> 02:17:17.320]  comments are indicative of what the dem of what democrats say to me and they say you're crazy
[02:17:17.320 --> 02:17:20.440]  we're going to take your guns and put you in a forced labor camp and we're going to kill you
[02:17:20.440 --> 02:17:24.200]  because you're a bad right winger when i'm just a constitutionalist i'm beyond their left right
[02:17:24.200 --> 02:17:30.760]  garbage and they say well yeah we're taking your guns because you're a right winger but but but
[02:17:30.760 --> 02:17:37.800]  you're a kook thinking we want to take your guns it's like these collectivists can't even think
[02:17:37.800 --> 02:17:42.760]  steward they're really bizarre people let's go to ronnie in utah says he spoke with a congressman
[02:17:42.760 --> 02:17:46.520]  has something he wants to tell us then mark and alex and kent and others go ahead ronnie
[02:17:47.400 --> 02:17:52.680]  guys thanks alex for taking the call i just like to get steward's take on this i just called
[02:17:53.800 --> 02:18:00.360]  my congressman jason jay was taught one of his aides and you to explore the tyranny new
[02:18:00.360 --> 02:18:08.040]  rule order you tell him about the 60 billion dollar bill on sandy and the 1315 billion the sport
[02:18:08.040 --> 02:18:15.720]  battle battle projects and on and on and on and the guns and the tyranny and the aides are like
[02:18:15.720 --> 02:18:21.240]  well all types of comments on them i mean it's just amazing well listen calling them isn't bad
[02:18:21.800 --> 02:18:25.720]  it's better to write them a letter it's also better to go when they go to these public speaking
[02:18:25.720 --> 02:18:30.520]  events like at the grocery store of the church to go and call them out remember at the original
[02:18:30.520 --> 02:18:35.400]  ron paul tea parties for the republicans took them over and yelled at them people went and
[02:18:35.400 --> 02:18:41.240]  shouted republicans and democrats down that's what we need is that specific republicans came in took
[02:18:41.240 --> 02:18:47.560]  it over you never saw that again we need the tea party to go in and get in the face physically
[02:18:47.560 --> 02:18:53.880]  listen i stormed the texas capital twice and they didn't arrest me because they knew i legally
[02:18:53.880 --> 02:18:57.240]  was able to go in there with 500 people or whatever and get in their face
[02:18:57.880 --> 02:19:01.160]  and if they would have arrested me that would have given it all the attention still got the
[02:19:01.160 --> 02:19:05.480]  attention so i stormed it twice i went down to the federal building and people are so cowardly
[02:19:05.480 --> 02:19:09.000]  they go there's no way he went in the federal building and told them that he was allowed to
[02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:14.040]  film them and don't you know how dare them i mean people are so cowardly they think like the texas
[02:19:14.040 --> 02:19:19.400]  capital footage is fake or and it's not that i'm even some tough guy we've got to get back in their
[02:19:19.400 --> 02:19:24.520]  face and tell them they're wrong or they're going to dominate us and convert fully to tyranny i do
[02:19:24.520 --> 02:19:30.920]  this because i'm afraid of them winning because the real danger is in is in submitting uh steward
[02:19:30.920 --> 02:19:37.000]  roads well sure you gotta get in the face of the anti gunners but also need to get in the face of
[02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:42.200]  the so-called republican allies of the second amendment makes me get very clear to them that
[02:19:42.200 --> 02:19:46.920]  we do consider this disarmament and they vote for it they're done when you have to pound it into their
[02:19:46.920 --> 02:19:52.280]  heads and you should confront them the best way to confront them is in a public forum put pressure
[02:19:52.280 --> 02:19:58.120]  on them bring 20 30 people with you because they perceive that as their vote that's all they care
[02:19:58.120 --> 02:20:02.600]  about is their own political skin most of them have no integrity left at all and the only one
[02:20:02.600 --> 02:20:06.920]  only way you're going to get through to them is making fear for their political future yeah we're
[02:20:06.920 --> 02:20:11.000]  going to skip this network break here i'm just an egging that announcement or is it so important
[02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:16.520]  to go back to calls folks you have to let them know by the way i know you think i'm stupid
[02:20:16.520 --> 02:20:20.360]  and and you think by incremental steps you're going to get our guns i'm going to do whatever
[02:20:20.360 --> 02:20:26.760]  it takes investigating your finances as a citizen journalist you name it until we bring you down is
[02:20:26.760 --> 02:20:31.000]  that clear scum and believe me it gets their attention they suddenly look at you and start
[02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:38.760]  sweating when they know you can see them it's time to let them know listen would be dictator i see you
[02:20:38.760 --> 02:20:44.760]  do you got it go ahead i'm sorry no you're right but like i said you need to put pressure on them
[02:20:44.760 --> 02:20:50.040]  i wouldn't bother calling i mean you want to call all you gotta say is is let him know he votes for
[02:20:50.040 --> 02:20:55.000]  this he's done that's all you gotta do don't try to change their mind don't write long eloquent
[02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:59.640]  dissertations just tell them you vote for that you're done and by the way you're a former constable
[02:21:00.760 --> 02:21:04.360]  former staffer of ron paul on the hill so you know what you're talking about your constitutional
[02:21:04.360 --> 02:21:08.760]  lawyer and veteran and founder of both keepers i should add for listeners that just tuned in
[02:21:08.760 --> 02:21:12.680]  what steward rode's our guest i've skipped this break so i can take some of the final calls and
[02:21:12.680 --> 02:21:17.960]  let's do it get into some solutions they'll have a jam packed 30 minutes on this issue after it but
[02:21:17.960 --> 02:21:22.200]  folks everything hinges on the guns if they can get away with this and they're already getting away
[02:21:22.200 --> 02:21:26.040]  with butcher and the rest of the Bill of Rights they're going to take us into hot tyranny the
[02:21:26.040 --> 02:21:33.400]  infrastructure is built they admit it okay they get those guns we are overrun and it's just going
[02:21:33.400 --> 02:21:39.480]  to get worse and worse uh alex in kansas you're on the air go ahead pleasure to be with both of
[02:21:39.480 --> 02:21:45.400]  you gentlemen um just a couple of questions with regards to uh michael harris who's a
[02:21:45.400 --> 02:21:53.400]  reporter for press i'm sorry for um veterans today uh is coming out and saying that uh
[02:21:53.400 --> 02:21:59.640]  you know this is a cover-up for what would look like a uh israel retaliation against the united
[02:21:59.640 --> 02:22:05.640]  states um once his uh video went out sort of the interview international interview went out
[02:22:05.640 --> 02:22:12.200]  he's being backed by uh military members uh veterans today has has received uh overwhelming
[02:22:12.200 --> 02:22:17.320]  responses one three star general quoted is saying harris hit the nail on the head and just wondered
[02:22:17.320 --> 02:22:22.680]  if you had sure is that the three star general by name it does not and i've i've been looking let me
[02:22:22.680 --> 02:22:27.640]  just say something let me just say something i that's a great sounding website and a great name
[02:22:28.520 --> 02:22:32.760]  i mean it's it's a world-class url and i didn't really even follow it and seen some
[02:22:32.760 --> 02:22:37.320]  interesting reports from like a month ago i'm like hey get those guys on they're like uh
[02:22:37.320 --> 02:22:42.600]  this guy's saying you're an operative on here yeah and i was like yeah so i mean things have been
[02:22:42.600 --> 02:22:47.400]  said about me on there that i know aren't true so look when you always hear and i'm not talking
[02:22:47.400 --> 02:22:52.280]  about his site but others or whoever i think it's a he runs it i don't have time to even keep track
[02:22:52.280 --> 02:22:58.840]  of all this stuff there's that eu site where it's like russian general say or this or that says
[02:22:58.840 --> 02:23:06.280]  it's always unnamed unnamed unnamed unnamed and i know it's fun to blame israel for everything and
[02:23:06.280 --> 02:23:10.920]  i've come on air and said the israeli lobby by and large is supporting gun control here which
[02:23:10.920 --> 02:23:16.680]  i think is out of control because our government helps arm israelis with free m16s if they want them
[02:23:16.680 --> 02:23:24.920]  and m16s in the schools so i think it's effective to go to schumer uh and feinstein and um bloomberg
[02:23:24.920 --> 02:23:31.160]  and other you know uh israeli operatives i mean they are israeli operatives and say look you you
[02:23:31.160 --> 02:23:36.680]  want our tax money so israelis can have guns use that on them that's really effective so again
[02:23:36.680 --> 02:23:43.000]  there's this culture started where you can say israeli's you know blew up the moon and it must
[02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:47.480]  be true and if you say it isn't your pro israel i'm a big critic of some of the things israel
[02:23:47.480 --> 02:23:52.520]  does but there's also a lot of stuff i think it's a tactic done by some where so much ridiculous
[02:23:52.520 --> 02:23:57.080]  stuff is said about israel that then all the real stuff going on never gets looked at stewart rhodes
[02:23:58.600 --> 02:24:04.280]  well i'm not really an authority on on those issues some of the past exactly it all becomes a
[02:24:04.280 --> 02:24:09.000]  diversion i mean it's like you know i'm i'm fighting the federal reserve and i want to get rid of it
[02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:12.680]  people say how dare you cover up for the jewish federal reserve and i'm like look whatever the
[02:24:12.680 --> 02:24:17.640]  federal reserve is let's just get rid of it shut up traitor you know let's not have war in syria
[02:24:17.640 --> 02:24:22.360]  how dare you be a trader for israel and i'm like no no i'm against war in syria shut up traitor
[02:24:22.360 --> 02:24:28.280]  idiot look look howl turner was fbi i knew that it came out he was this is an important area to
[02:24:28.280 --> 02:24:33.400]  cover but see because it's only in certain quarters of the internet people think that that's really
[02:24:34.280 --> 02:24:39.320]  a discussion that even matters and radio listeners they have no idea what we're even talking about go
[02:24:39.320 --> 02:24:45.960]  ahead i was gonna say that one thing i will say is look you know there are plenty of gentile white
[02:24:45.960 --> 02:24:52.760]  annual sacks and protestant old breaking traders in congress and and in the banking system exactly
[02:24:52.760 --> 02:24:57.960]  no banking so i think i think it's ridiculous to say it's you know we have to focus on one race
[02:24:57.960 --> 02:25:03.800]  exactly it becomes a giant cop out where where where no one involved in corruption can ever
[02:25:03.800 --> 02:25:08.920]  be confronted because well we all know the only evil in this world is you know a certain group
[02:25:08.920 --> 02:25:15.000]  which is a giant cop out i'm sick of it it's just i'm and but as long as you're bashing jews it's
[02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:20.280]  supposedly okay internet etiquette to make up anything you want about anybody you know i mean
[02:25:20.280 --> 02:25:25.560]  they say i i i'm jewish and work for israel i'm not but okay i'm jewish okay we're gonna come
[02:25:25.560 --> 02:25:30.760]  put you know come shoot me in the head yeah i get the same thing actually i'm part mexicans they

[02:25:37.560 --> 02:25:42.760]  and irish and uh in scottish and and english but listen notice we're here talking about how
[02:25:42.760 --> 02:25:47.240]  executive orders to take our guns and i'm not bashing the caller it's just that
[02:25:49.080 --> 02:25:54.280]  the legitimate criticism of the of the israel lobby a large part of it is that it's it's lobbying
[02:25:54.280 --> 02:25:58.840]  to get our guns so that it can politically control the united states so is the military
[02:25:58.840 --> 02:26:03.480]  industrial complex so are some of the other big lobbies let's get in these lobbies faces
[02:26:03.480 --> 02:26:08.920]  they're trying to take down the nra is one of our most important lobbies well the nra is helping
[02:26:08.920 --> 02:26:13.080]  them though look at the nra is done recently nothing they did nothing on friday and nothing over
[02:26:13.080 --> 02:26:17.800]  the weekend they've said nothing in the sense of the bill of rights because you know i think they're
[02:26:18.840 --> 02:26:23.320]  i don't know the paper tigers no that's what gun owners of america has been forced to say
[02:26:23.320 --> 02:26:27.240]  he's tried to be classy about it but we're gonna have to continue with your story because i want
[02:26:27.240 --> 02:26:31.720]  to get to your solutions but we got diverted off into uh you know israel did this is there
[02:26:31.720 --> 02:26:37.080]  anything israel didn't do like if i fall in a banana pill tonight again i'm just sick of the
[02:26:37.080 --> 02:26:42.600]  mental illness of it you know just of just everything of oh this the jews did and that the
[02:26:42.600 --> 02:26:47.160]  jews did it just becomes i mean these people act like jews are like om omnipresent you know
[02:26:47.160 --> 02:26:52.120]  gandalf the wizard can do anything they want i mean it's just so annoying i'm sorry i take
[02:26:52.120 --> 02:26:59.320]  responsibility for the for your failure to guard your own constitution you can't just blame it on
[02:26:59.320 --> 02:27:04.280]  a foreign country and i understand their arguments about the influence of a foreign country and dual
[02:27:04.280 --> 02:27:10.600]  loyalties and all that and i agree it's a problem but they're long and we cover it and the anti israel
[02:27:10.600 --> 02:27:18.040]  crowd never recognizes and then they lie they twist they make up things they edit things and then
[02:27:18.040 --> 02:27:24.440]  say it's proof and it's all i'm saying is israel's got some big problems but the people attacking
[02:27:24.440 --> 02:27:32.520]  israel are a bunch of liars it's i mean i've just never seen more deceptive scum that's my point
[02:27:32.520 --> 02:27:35.960]  let's go ahead and take another call uh and i'm not talking about even the guy with other
[02:27:35.960 --> 02:27:42.200]  website i'm talking about generally uh let's talk to uh let's talk to mark on gun control history
[02:27:42.200 --> 02:27:47.720]  you're on the air mark hey gentlemen it's great to talk to uh george washington and modern day is
[02:27:47.720 --> 02:27:52.920]  real busy so i've been studying a little bit about gun control and as you guys know it's not about
[02:27:52.920 --> 02:27:59.160]  guns it's about control so if you go back and study history you'll learn that in the 12th century
[02:27:59.160 --> 02:28:05.720]  pope innocent the second actually banned crossbows which was relatively new weapon which was able
[02:28:05.720 --> 02:28:10.520]  to pierce the armor of the soldiers and that obviously threatened the power monopoly of the
[02:28:10.520 --> 02:28:17.640]  state you can look at japan and 1876 the hitori edict they actually banned swords people who weren't
[02:28:17.640 --> 02:28:23.000]  in the military couldn't have swords in public or else they would be confiscated searches goes to show
[02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:28.760]  that whatever means of defense that people have against the tyranny the tyranny is going to try to
[02:28:28.760 --> 02:28:36.440]  take absolutely and you've got all these snot-nosed idiots running around that will cover it after
[02:28:36.440 --> 02:28:40.120]  the break let me just read it now i appreciate your call great point we're going to do a final
[02:28:40.120 --> 02:28:43.240]  segment a few minutes with steward plugging some solutions then i'm going to get to some other
[02:28:43.240 --> 02:28:50.920]  special reports we need to hit and more phone calls but this is uh ral v m k on a video uh i had posted
[02:28:52.040 --> 02:28:56.040]  about how they're coming for our guns and see now they're not denying they're coming for them they go
[02:28:56.040 --> 02:29:00.440]  yeah you bet we're coming for them the gun rights gang insists that it's not about guns it's about
[02:29:00.440 --> 02:29:05.160]  not letting crazy people have guns i agree and i'd like to propose that crazy should be defined to
[02:29:05.160 --> 02:29:10.600]  include anyone who fetishizes guns now we fetishize tyrants won't take us over we're obsessed with
[02:29:10.600 --> 02:29:15.640]  knowing the history of it stockpiled ammunition is obsessed with being disarmed uh black ewan
[02:29:15.640 --> 02:29:20.040]  helicopters and the coming apocalypse this guy is one of the first ones who should be disarmed
[02:29:20.040 --> 02:29:24.600]  talking about me before he blows a gasket and starts firing from a water tower somewhere
[02:29:24.600 --> 02:29:31.320]  like one of your prozac heads now again this is the standard deal they're now you bet you guys are
[02:29:31.320 --> 02:29:36.200]  see the collectivists want our money and they want our energy and it always ends with productive
[02:29:36.200 --> 02:29:41.480]  citizens in a forced labor camp with potbellied collectivists standing over us with machine guns
[02:29:41.480 --> 02:29:46.520]  they lay they are the ones that fetishize the guns they are my guns i got piles up my heart
[02:29:46.520 --> 02:29:49.640]  doesn't even have time to get them out i don't fetishize them i've been shooting them since i

[02:33:31.160 --> 02:33:36.680]  it is bizarre ladies and gentlemen we're finding more and more videos of parents of the children
[02:33:37.960 --> 02:33:42.600]  laughing and giggling and looking excited and then saying off camera do i read off the card
[02:33:42.600 --> 02:33:50.600]  and then walking up and breaking down on camera on tv we need to and we need to have
[02:33:50.600 --> 02:33:57.560]  private investigators look into sandy hook okay hitler blew up his own capital building to bring
[02:33:57.560 --> 02:34:03.960]  in martial law europe australian new zealand banned most guns after staging mass shootings the
[02:34:03.960 --> 02:34:13.880]  evidence later came out this thing looks really really bad um i'm getting more information on
[02:34:13.880 --> 02:34:18.840]  this and i'm gonna look at playing that video before this hour ends and we have the other
[02:34:18.840 --> 02:34:25.080]  incredible video i can describe it for radio listeners female us cop caught on tape giving two
[02:34:25.080 --> 02:34:30.760]  women body cavity searches during routine traffic stop and using the same gloves on both well why
[02:34:30.760 --> 02:34:38.120]  not tsa does but this is in the pants in hey let's go in the back all right let's go in the front
[02:34:38.920 --> 02:34:45.480]  and uh the state police say this is their new policy they've been tsa trained and that they may
[02:34:45.480 --> 02:34:50.520]  because they say be prepared and so the dps director is being sued over this but do they
[02:34:50.520 --> 02:34:56.200]  say we're going to do it and that now routinely when you're pulled over they will give you a
[02:34:56.200 --> 02:35:01.640]  proctology exam basically they will not just go in your pants they will go in your body and if
[02:35:01.640 --> 02:35:05.720]  you don't like it you'll go to jail as a terrorist you resist you'll be killed so that's the new
[02:35:05.720 --> 02:35:13.480]  america i got a bunch more calls here and uh steward roads by the way i've now got the text of
[02:35:13.480 --> 02:35:19.800]  biden and obama and they are going to create a task force working with governors and members of
[02:35:19.800 --> 02:35:25.080]  congress and they will be delivered in one month just when they get ready to bring the new session
[02:35:25.080 --> 02:35:30.520]  of congress in to obama and then he will take action and what is reuters and bloomberg saying
[02:35:30.520 --> 02:35:35.800]  it will be executive order so he'll say i talked to the council of governors which are little
[02:35:35.800 --> 02:35:41.160]  minions of fema and i've talked to the rural council which is minions of fema not not the
[02:35:41.160 --> 02:35:46.200]  real legislatures not the people plus the constitution you'd have to amend it so this gives them
[02:35:46.200 --> 02:35:53.080]  dictatorial cover they always do this oh hitler had a regional governors that would have signed off
[02:35:53.080 --> 02:35:58.520]  on what he did as well he had courts that would sign off so it's rubber stamps now i don't need
[02:35:58.520 --> 02:36:04.760]  congress i have some governors i talked to and the word is from reuters it will be
[02:36:06.360 --> 02:36:10.600]  that they can just put anybody on a no gun by list no judge no jury not even any mental background
[02:36:10.600 --> 02:36:18.680]  just you don't own guns from a manual promised and then uh expanding on that uh they will then
[02:36:18.680 --> 02:36:23.480]  ban the sale of semi-autos which you already see being done by the companies that congress says
[02:36:23.480 --> 02:36:28.760]  is doing the right thing implying the guns are dirty they did it and so they're just creating
[02:36:28.760 --> 02:36:36.760]  a mass hoax and this new task force will it's the new gun federal task force and it will work with
[02:36:36.760 --> 02:36:43.720]  locals to implement whatever the task force says and obama will follow it so it's like i'm a dictator
[02:36:43.720 --> 02:36:50.920]  but i do what nato says congress you don't give me authority to attack nato does obama i'm not a
[02:36:50.920 --> 02:36:56.120]  dictator but whatever the task force tells me i'll then use the dictatorial power of the presidency
[02:36:56.120 --> 02:37:02.120]  to do folks if you studied history this is incredible stalin had a rubber stamped duma
[02:37:02.840 --> 02:37:10.040]  that would certify hitler had it uh the greatest mass murder in history mouse a tongue had one of
[02:37:10.040 --> 02:37:15.960]  these kuba has one of these i mean wow they are really just going back to good old-fashioned
[02:37:15.960 --> 02:37:21.800]  rubber stamped bullet bureaus creating their known new task force and saying so the general dumb
[02:37:21.800 --> 02:37:27.640]  now public goes well the task force said i don't matter what congress ain't for it the task force
[02:37:27.640 --> 02:37:34.360]  said the tsa says they train the stexas police they're allowed to stick their fingers in you now
[02:37:34.360 --> 02:37:40.360]  i mean they said so sturt roads you're a constitutional lawyer ain't that all right sturt
[02:37:41.560 --> 02:37:46.760]  well the answer to this is nullification the answer is is in your local communities
[02:37:47.320 --> 02:37:53.000]  and your your towns your counties in your states you must nullify and states are already doing
[02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:58.360]  that we've seen nullification bills in michigan texas virginia arizona across the board against
[02:37:58.360 --> 02:38:03.880]  the ndaa we're going to see them against this kind of this kind nonsense also and so you hold
[02:38:03.880 --> 02:38:09.160]  your sheriff's feet to the fire you make sure he's a constitutional sheriff if he's not you route him
[02:38:09.160 --> 02:38:14.600]  out of office no matter what party he's in even if he's a good old boy republican he goes down the
[02:38:14.600 --> 02:38:19.800]  road and replace him with somebody who will obey his oh that's ground zero and he got somebody who
[02:38:19.800 --> 02:38:25.000]  will stand up for your rights and then you back him up with a posse and even better you back him up
[02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:31.800]  with a county militia and that is where your focus of resistance needs to be is in your local community
[02:38:31.800 --> 02:38:38.280]  in your state you must nullify at the same time you must sweep out of office every oath breaker
[02:38:38.280 --> 02:38:45.000]  who's in office scorched earth policy they violate their oath they're gone you tell them i don't care
[02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:50.520]  of the democrat winds you're gone you violated your oath just make a difference with part of your
[02:38:50.520 --> 02:38:57.160]  end this is the response that madison and jeperson urged on the american people back in 1798 in response
[02:38:57.160 --> 02:39:02.040]  to the alien sedition act which are also a gross violation of the constitution they didn't go hat
[02:39:02.040 --> 02:39:06.920]  in hand to the supreme court and ask the court to defend the constitution they knew the presidency
[02:39:06.920 --> 02:39:11.240]  was already corrupt they had his administration they knew congress was overrun with federalists
[02:39:11.240 --> 02:39:16.520]  so what did they do they went to the legislature of the state and said you must nullify but we
[02:39:16.520 --> 02:39:22.360]  create a new party and purge the federalists out of office that's they did they purge them out
[02:39:22.360 --> 02:39:28.600]  we must do the same thing a two-prong attack nullify while you that's right and everything legal
[02:39:28.600 --> 02:39:35.640]  and lawful but aggressive as possible yeah now we need to go and bullhorn congressman's houses
[02:39:35.640 --> 02:39:40.520]  we need to bullhorn their events we need to put private investigators on them because they're all

[02:40:44.120 --> 02:40:49.000]  over infrastructure and people go well that's scary i better not do anything no no no you
[02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:53.240]  better do something because it's such an evil infrastructure that's because they want to use
[02:40:53.240 --> 02:40:59.240]  an honest we just use the fact that they're so evil against them they can't get away with this
[02:40:59.880 --> 02:41:06.040]  historically if you attack a would be authoritarian takeover before it fully launches it's kind of
[02:41:06.040 --> 02:41:10.760]  like how they have space-based weapons to use a military analogy that that that particle beam
[02:41:10.760 --> 02:41:15.240]  a rocket when it's on the ground this thing is fueled they're firing up they're getting ready
[02:41:15.240 --> 02:41:21.560]  to launch it we have got to maximum firepower politically blow that three-stage rocket up
[02:41:21.560 --> 02:41:29.480]  on the launch pad but we've got to fire now steward absolutely and a big part of it is also
[02:41:29.480 --> 02:41:35.240]  is not waiting for the politicians to defend your rights or defend your the person but to take
[02:41:35.240 --> 02:41:40.520]  personal responsibility and then that means in your local communities going to your sheriff and
[02:41:40.520 --> 02:41:46.920]  saying we want you to deputize teachers we want you to deputize retired police officers put them
[02:41:46.920 --> 02:41:51.720]  in the schools we want you to train the teachers but even more basically than that you go do it
[02:41:51.720 --> 02:41:56.680]  that's why we put out a call out for our membership to step up and volunteer to teach teachers and
[02:41:56.680 --> 02:42:02.520]  school staff how to shoot how to defend themselves with knives with blunt objects with pepper spray
[02:42:02.520 --> 02:42:07.240]  with guns whatever they need to and provide that training we're getting a great response from teachers
[02:42:07.240 --> 02:42:12.200]  across the country who want to be trained and so you step up in your local community and you
[02:42:12.200 --> 02:42:19.560]  solve the problem the problem that existed in the new town connecticut school was a victim
[02:42:19.560 --> 02:42:26.280]  disarmament zone of no one being able to actually resist and fight back against armament shooter
[02:42:26.280 --> 02:42:31.880]  so you solve that problem in your community you arm your teachers you arm your veterans you arm
[02:42:31.880 --> 02:42:36.840]  your your volunteers to go into the schools and be there to be the reaction force they're the first
[02:42:36.840 --> 02:42:42.840]  responders the police are second responders but when they get there the fight's over almost always
[02:42:42.840 --> 02:42:47.800]  and so the teachers need to be armed and trained do it don't wait for someone to do it for you
[02:42:47.800 --> 02:42:52.840]  don't wait for politicians to say it's okay you just go do it but i'll tell you the way i'll tell
[02:42:52.840 --> 02:42:57.320]  you the way to absolutely checkmate them because they act like you know under federal law nobody
[02:42:57.320 --> 02:43:02.520]  can be armed at schools no you just go to your good sheriffs it'll be a huge news issue when they do
[02:43:02.520 --> 02:43:07.640]  it and i'll guarantee you you can come up with a school fund just like police are guarding movie
[02:43:07.640 --> 02:43:13.800]  theaters for you know 15 bucks an hour you can guarantee get folks to volunteer but that's an
[02:43:13.800 --> 02:43:20.280]  auxiliary you can definitely get retired police you name it or other people or veterans whatever
[02:43:20.280 --> 02:43:23.640]  so they so we know they've you know got and they can even do what they want to their background all
[02:43:23.640 --> 02:43:30.280]  that stuff and then have them there as the auxiliary security force just like you have
[02:43:31.400 --> 02:43:35.960]  you know the old veteran helping the kids at the crosswalk and i like what jesse ventura says
[02:43:35.960 --> 02:43:41.880]  you just have them there in like a jumpsuit or whatever and you know they can just be the i mean
[02:43:41.880 --> 02:43:46.120]  you could tell the kids or they could be just custodians that are there with a fanny pack
[02:43:46.120 --> 02:43:52.680]  you know with a handgun in it but again that's almost giving into the hysteria i mean you've had
[02:43:52.680 --> 02:43:59.800]  school shootings on average maybe maybe 30 kids a year 88 total mass shootings most of them getting
[02:43:59.800 --> 02:44:05.000]  related one of these things only happens four or five you know every four or five years it really
[02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:12.680]  is a hoax i mean it's a real crisis for those 20 dead kids but uh again you've heard my analogy
[02:44:12.680 --> 02:44:18.760]  steward but the focus but it puts the focus on an actual solution to the problem they've created
[02:44:18.760 --> 02:44:24.600]  it created the problem by disarming people and so the solution is is to arm them and it's very
[02:44:24.600 --> 02:44:29.080]  easy like you just said it's very easy for a retired cop who's already gone through background
[02:44:29.080 --> 02:44:34.120]  checks already had training et cetera to step up and say i volunteer and our members are willing
[02:44:34.120 --> 02:44:39.160]  to do that we're going to have uh retired police officers and oathkeepers who are going to go
[02:44:39.160 --> 02:44:43.720]  volunteer by the way don't let them be involved in searching lockers and harassing people and
[02:44:43.720 --> 02:44:49.880]  you know pregnancy test or whatever just there for the you know one in a million mass shooting
[02:44:49.880 --> 02:44:56.120]  that's it that they're there they're there as a last resort to defend the people against violence
[02:44:56.120 --> 02:45:02.120]  that's it but even better than that train the teachers train the teachers and the staff why
[02:45:02.120 --> 02:45:07.720]  why is israel you know having m16s and lockers in every classroom uh for you know the you know
[02:45:07.720 --> 02:45:12.680]  the one in a million when the palestinians have gone in and killed kids i mean why i mean imagine
[02:45:12.680 --> 02:45:18.360]  if israel said the answer is israelis turn in all your guns everyone would laugh at that i think
[02:45:18.360 --> 02:45:24.680]  this is a key truth weapon against their lies to point out why does why does taxpayer money go
[02:45:24.680 --> 02:45:32.120]  to arm the israelis in their schools but then that same federal government wants our guns to it
[02:45:33.400 --> 02:45:38.760]  yeah it's a fair point hypocrisy and you know but still the big the main thing is to take back
[02:45:38.760 --> 02:45:44.200]  responsibility at the local level however you do it through the sheriff's department through veterans
[02:45:44.200 --> 02:45:49.000]  through police officers are retired through the teachers whatever works in your community
[02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:56.040]  you solve the problem there locally that's how you counter the the the propaganda coming from dc
[02:45:56.040 --> 02:46:02.040]  that you must be disarmed you can say look we took care of it it's it's done there's no no more
[02:46:02.040 --> 02:46:06.840]  shooting gonna happen here like that one school district in texas it's been doing it since 2007
[02:46:06.840 --> 02:46:11.720]  they have armed teachers no one knows whose arm they're all concealed they don't know no one knows
[02:46:11.720 --> 02:46:16.280]  and by the way the feds keep saying it's illegal it's lawful because it's going on and now rick
[02:46:16.280 --> 02:46:20.280]  perry i gotta give rick perry credit he's been an evil globalist in the past but he may have
[02:46:20.280 --> 02:46:26.040]  changed his tribes he says arm all the teachers well here's the here's the sad problem of a lot
[02:46:26.040 --> 02:46:32.200]  of conservatives the only part of the constitution they still have a real devotion to is the second
[02:46:32.200 --> 02:46:37.640]  amendment and so brainwashed by the neocons that they've you know kind of forgotten all about the
[02:46:37.640 --> 02:46:42.280]  rest of it but i still care about that that's just a reality we're gonna deal with it we try to get
[02:46:42.280 --> 02:46:47.800]  them back into the fold about caring about all the bill of rights but hey let's take advantage
[02:46:47.800 --> 02:46:53.800]  of the situation in some ways to at least get them to be resolute about this and if we're gonna
[02:46:53.800 --> 02:46:58.680]  have a fight let it come now over the second amendment we can get over with story talk about
[02:46:58.680 --> 02:47:03.720]  talk about any other solutions you've got well i think the most important thing i can say is
[02:47:03.720 --> 02:47:07.480]  is to reach out to the guys with a gun they're not selling a broken record but the liberty
[02:47:07.480 --> 02:47:13.160]  movement really needs to focus on the guys with the guns especially the military that's the most
[02:47:13.160 --> 02:47:18.520]  critical population because you know we are at the crossroads where we're either going to have to
[02:47:18.520 --> 02:47:23.640]  fight another revolution or we have a very limited window of opportunity to roll things back piece
[02:47:23.640 --> 02:47:28.760]  by purging out the old breakers and that's the other big thing you've got to get rid of this idea
[02:47:28.760 --> 02:47:33.160]  that you're going to support lesser two evils you got to stop doing that it's like taking a
[02:47:33.160 --> 02:47:38.600]  reduced dose of poison over and over again you're still going to die so you got to stop doing that
[02:47:38.600 --> 02:47:44.440]  but to buy you more time focus on the guys with the guns that will cause strategic doubt in their
[02:47:44.440 --> 02:47:50.360]  minds of the elites about whether or not they can get away with trying to pull the plug finally
[02:47:50.360 --> 02:47:55.240]  you want to make them worry about it worry about whether they'll be resisted by their own ranks
[02:47:55.240 --> 02:48:01.400]  and that buys us more time to purge them out everybody who's in current political power
[02:48:01.400 --> 02:48:07.000]  is only this generation they're not permanent you can get rid of them you can purge them out
[02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:12.760]  if you're willing to have the moral courage to do it in politics it will take time though so to buy
[02:48:12.760 --> 02:48:17.640]  more time focus on the guys with the guns make sure they understand what's right and wrong so
[02:48:17.640 --> 02:48:23.080]  that you cause that that hesitancy in the power elites and buy you more time to get rid of them
[02:48:23.080 --> 02:48:28.280]  that's your only chance that and getting ready for the worst-case scenario which means you better
[02:48:28.280 --> 02:48:33.800]  be strengthened as an individual as a community your veterans to be woken up in your community
[02:48:33.800 --> 02:48:38.120]  they should be getting themselves prepared for the worst-case scenarios and nullify in your
[02:48:38.120 --> 02:48:42.360]  local communities and states turn i want to get this message across to everybody right now
[02:48:42.360 --> 02:48:48.760]  now authoritarian foreign banks have taken over they're running psi ops they probably even stage
[02:48:48.760 --> 02:48:56.120]  this event in sandy hook you better grow up folks i'm sorry the mainline neo-con talk show hosts
[02:48:56.120 --> 02:49:00.760]  are going to sell you down the river okay i'm risking my life so a steward to bring you this
[02:49:00.760 --> 02:49:07.000]  information because we realize what we're facing and the fact that we're still operating expose these
[02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:10.360]  globalists is key we're going to break a two-minute stirrer i'm going to let you take us out to break
[02:49:10.360 --> 02:49:13.400]  and i'm going to come back and play some video clips but i'm going to let you have the floor in
[02:49:13.400 --> 02:49:18.120]  the last minute and a half you take us out to break Stuart well like i said before the main
[02:49:18.120 --> 02:49:25.400]  thing is is folks have got to stand up do not let them intimidate you not don't let them con you
[02:49:25.400 --> 02:49:30.920]  and trick you into apologizing for the murder of children you have nothing to do with you have no
[02:49:31.560 --> 02:49:37.720]  no cause for apologizing in fact it's the exact opposite it's the victim disarmament freaks who
[02:49:37.720 --> 02:49:43.480]  have insisted on living those children defenseless who owe everybody else an apology it is their
[02:49:43.480 --> 02:49:51.080]  psychosis and their fear of firearms that has made them has driven them to create victim disarmament
[02:49:51.080 --> 02:49:57.720]  zones where it's like you know a bait for a coyote or a bait for wolves and draws mass shooters
[02:49:57.720 --> 02:50:02.360]  but put it back on them and their own personal responsibility and also make it very clear that
[02:50:02.360 --> 02:50:07.240]  you will not disarm decide right now that you will never disarm that you will pass on your
[02:50:07.240 --> 02:50:11.960]  firearms to your children and then you as an american have drawn that line in the sand
[02:50:11.960 --> 02:50:16.840]  you know at least be resolute about that and let's get past worrying about what congress does
[02:50:16.840 --> 02:50:21.160]  let them know that no matter what they do you will not comply and and that's it and the other big
[02:50:21.160 --> 02:50:26.760]  one is is you've got to purge out the politicians if you let politicians continue to be reelected
[02:50:26.760 --> 02:50:30.360]  because you're afraid of the opposing party if your republicans continue to vote for oath
[02:50:30.360 --> 02:50:46.280]  breaking traitors like John McCain or Lindsey Graham or Romney then you will compel us to fight
[02:51:01.320 --> 02:51:05.880]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[02:51:05.880 --> 02:51:10.200]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[02:51:10.200 --> 02:51:15.240]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[02:51:15.240 --> 02:51:20.840]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[02:51:20.840 --> 02:51:25.960]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[02:51:25.960 --> 02:51:31.240]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[02:51:31.240 --> 02:51:35.800]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from
[02:51:35.800 --> 02:51:41.080]  weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[02:51:41.080 --> 02:51:45.400]  peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science
