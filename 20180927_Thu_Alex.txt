[00:00.000 --> 00:14.240]  Trashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[00:14.240 --> 00:28.000]  front lines of the Info War.
[00:28.000 --> 00:35.480]  Well, Christine Blazied Ford is the most incredible witness I've ever seen.
[00:35.480 --> 00:40.520]  She looks like a homeless crazy person and acts like one.
[00:40.520 --> 00:44.760]  I predicted that there would be three more women after her and that they would release
[00:44.760 --> 00:49.640]  the final woman the morning of the hearing.
[00:49.640 --> 00:53.120]  And sure enough, that's happened exactly like we predicted.
[00:53.120 --> 00:57.080]  She also said in her testimony that she started thinking about talking to the press when the
[00:57.080 --> 01:02.880]  media came to her house and that she was looking at her dog.
[01:02.880 --> 01:08.640]  I mean, folks, this is so bizarre that I am staggered at this point.
[01:08.640 --> 01:12.640]  We've got the live coverage here, but the way they're worshiping her and kid-gloving
[01:12.640 --> 01:13.640]  her.
[01:13.640 --> 01:16.760]  And then we've got the photos and videos of her being a wild woman and all.
[01:16.760 --> 01:21.880]  But then instead, you know, she sat first at her hair all in front in the big glasses.
[01:21.880 --> 01:25.480]  But more and more she's coming out of the, coming out of the shell and being more of
[01:25.480 --> 01:26.480]  herself.
[01:26.480 --> 01:31.040]  She was cross-examined and just stories were tied in complete knots.
[01:31.040 --> 01:35.480]  And then you can see the coaching when, well, are you sure it's Kavanaugh?
[01:35.480 --> 01:37.760]  100% it's him.
[01:37.760 --> 01:44.960]  You see, this is for all the greater good to stop the evil right wing, you see.
[01:44.960 --> 01:52.520]  I want an Amy Coney Barrett, beautiful woman, great judge, a constitutionalist, a patriot.
[01:52.520 --> 01:57.040]  But don't think Trump's going to try her next if Kavanaugh fails.
[01:57.040 --> 01:58.880]  I think we're on a razor's edge right now.
[01:58.880 --> 02:04.080]  They're going to be women saying that she gang raped them with fire hoses, folks.
[02:04.080 --> 02:07.560]  So the Democrats aren't going to stop.
[02:07.560 --> 02:12.520]  That's why they're death-threading everybody, you know, at the restaurant where Cruz ate
[02:12.520 --> 02:13.520]  now.
[02:13.520 --> 02:15.320]  I mean, I deal with these people.
[02:15.320 --> 02:18.040]  They are mad dog.
[02:18.040 --> 02:23.360]  They'll do anything because their religion is dominating the American people.
[02:23.360 --> 02:28.280]  David Knight's going to ride shotgun with me for much of the broadcast today.
[02:28.280 --> 02:29.640]  We rarely see David get hot.
[02:29.640 --> 02:33.200]  He has been honored to pistol today on air, doing a great job.
[02:33.200 --> 02:35.560]  We're going to go to the highlights, the lowlights of this.
[02:35.560 --> 02:36.560]  I'll be honest with you.
[02:36.560 --> 02:37.840]  I want to spare you this lady.
[02:37.840 --> 02:38.840]  She is nauseating.
[02:38.840 --> 02:40.680]  And I'm not going to lie.
[02:40.680 --> 02:43.360]  David, what do you make of this bizarreness?
[02:43.360 --> 02:47.880]  Well, you know, Alex, she deserves to be heard, but she has to earn the right to be
[02:47.880 --> 02:48.880]  believed.
[02:48.880 --> 02:53.720]  And that means that the details that she has, has to line up with somebody else.
[02:53.720 --> 02:57.480]  They've repeatedly said, and you just heard Sheldon Whitehouse, and this is a guy who's
[02:57.480 --> 03:02.640]  put forth numerous anonymous allegations in the last 24 hours.
[03:02.640 --> 03:05.320]  One of them, the guy immediately said, well, I'm taking that back.
[03:05.320 --> 03:08.280]  As soon as people discovered his identity, he pulled back.
[03:08.280 --> 03:11.720]  But Sheldon Whitehouse was out there saying, this is totally unprecedented.
[03:11.720 --> 03:13.040]  We should have had the FBI in here.
[03:13.040 --> 03:14.680]  And of course, I played it yesterday.
[03:14.680 --> 03:20.000]  We have Joe Biden saying, 1991, the Clarence Thomas and Ed Hill thing, says, shut up about
[03:20.000 --> 03:21.000]  the FBI.
[03:21.000 --> 03:22.000]  The FBI is irrelevant to this.
[03:22.000 --> 03:25.440]  All they're going to do is interview him, interview her, said, she said, she said this,
[03:25.440 --> 03:26.440]  and he said that.
[03:26.440 --> 03:28.240]  And he goes, they're not going to draw any conclusions.
[03:28.240 --> 03:29.240]  It doesn't really matter.
[03:29.240 --> 03:35.640]  But we also had earlier, we had Dick Durbin accusing the Republicans of obstruction to
[03:35.640 --> 03:41.360]  which Senator Grassley was very angry, and he said, I'll remind you that it was 45 days
[03:41.360 --> 03:45.600]  or more that Dianne Feinstein said on this letter from Dr. Ford and didn't do anything
[03:45.600 --> 03:46.600]  about it.
[03:46.600 --> 03:49.680]  So we could have done an extensive investigation of all this, but nothing happened.
[03:49.680 --> 03:51.760]  Feinstein really chews in to Grassley.
[03:51.760 --> 03:55.560]  We're going to come back in 60 seconds and we're going to get into these clips and we're
[03:55.560 --> 03:58.000]  going to play Joe Biden and all the rest of it.
[03:58.000 --> 04:03.720]  I've just got to say, last night this morning, there's a fourth accuser.
[04:03.720 --> 04:07.760]  And then, yes, they called the switchboard and they wouldn't say their name or who they
[04:07.760 --> 04:10.280]  were, but they said her daughter was raped.
[04:10.280 --> 04:14.720]  I mean, now, oh, here, random phone call, oh, Kavanaugh rapes you.
[04:14.720 --> 04:15.720]  Okay, that's it.
[04:15.720 --> 04:16.720]  Then execute him.
[04:16.720 --> 04:19.360]  I mean, this is becoming insane.
[04:19.360 --> 04:21.920]  And then these are not only anonymous.
[04:21.920 --> 04:22.920]  These are hearsay.
[04:22.920 --> 04:26.280]  There was a guy saying, well, I heard that somebody else said this and he did all that
[04:26.280 --> 04:28.000]  and not the same thing with his mother.
[04:28.000 --> 04:30.000]  You know, it's anonymous as well as hearsay.
[04:30.000 --> 04:34.160]  Well, this is something the so-called media does is they do this to me now.
[04:34.160 --> 04:39.080]  They go, a man named Doyle says Jones was once in a movie theater and said, I don't believe
[04:39.080 --> 04:41.080]  any of it and I hate America.
[04:41.080 --> 04:46.680]  Hey, total lie, but they just, a guy named Doyle says, oh, wait, there's a phone call
[04:46.680 --> 04:48.080]  on the switchboard for you, Senator.
[04:48.080 --> 04:49.680]  Oh, Kavanaugh rapes your daughter.
[04:49.680 --> 04:51.280]  Oh, but you won't come forward, Joseor.
[04:51.280 --> 04:52.280]  Thank you.
[04:52.280 --> 04:53.800]  We'll put this in every newspaper right away.
[04:53.800 --> 04:58.920]  I just got a phone call randomly and I've got, since they doxed my number, I've got
[04:58.920 --> 05:00.760]  people calling my phone saying that.
[05:00.760 --> 05:05.960]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[05:05.960 --> 05:10.360]  The war is being openly targeted by the Democratic party left to CIA operatives, the corrupt
[05:10.360 --> 05:14.560]  justice department and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[05:14.560 --> 05:16.520]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[05:16.520 --> 05:20.560]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground and I knew we had
[05:20.560 --> 05:22.160]  no future if we didn't do this.
[05:22.160 --> 05:27.160]  So we've already had incredible success, but if you will simply realize how epic this
[05:27.160 --> 05:32.400]  is and understand how real this fight is and why we've been made the main target and if
[05:32.400 --> 05:38.360]  you financially support us and if you spread the word about our articles and videos, m4s.com,
[05:38.360 --> 05:43.280]  we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags, we'll win.
[05:43.280 --> 05:47.920]  We have huge sales, m4store.com right now and we're still able to operate the shopping
[05:47.920 --> 05:51.400]  cart, get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact we're trying to block our commerce
[05:51.400 --> 05:53.360]  and you're right to the market.
[05:53.360 --> 05:57.040]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and the Globalist may win.
[05:57.040 --> 06:03.360]  This is Info Wars, darkness hour, we're your support, I'm counting on you.
[06:03.360 --> 06:05.920]  Waging war on corruption.
[06:05.920 --> 06:16.480]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[06:16.480 --> 06:22.320]  Well Ford came in and played her little shrinking violet victim card, had her hair all on her
[06:22.320 --> 06:27.320]  face, hide my hundred glasses, but she's coming out of the show now, a woman that everybody
[06:27.320 --> 06:31.600]  says they know that's the big party animal, wild, students give her the lowest ratings
[06:31.600 --> 06:39.880]  of anybody, very vindictive, very hateful and I mean this is just unbelievable to see
[06:39.880 --> 06:47.040]  this level of a Jezebel spirit, the spirit of Hillary Clinton, they're God, the man haters,
[06:47.040 --> 06:51.520]  God, Hillary Clinton was supposed to get in and you know what, she gets to be heard?
[06:51.520 --> 06:59.440]  She gets to say that she has the credibility of a sieve, you know a good case holds water.
[06:59.440 --> 07:06.080]  Well this lady is a colander, I mean this lady is what you dump hot pasta into over
[07:06.080 --> 07:12.600]  the kitchen sink, I mean she is as disingenuous as anything I have ever seen, if I was trying
[07:12.600 --> 07:18.520]  to typecast someone for a made for TV movie about something like this, I, if I was typecasting
[07:18.520 --> 07:25.000]  a lying individual, I would typecast her and her story all falls apart and then you've
[07:25.000 --> 07:32.480]  got a fifth accuser that's withdrawn and said it was a hoax, a fourth accuser called the
[07:32.480 --> 07:39.360]  senate switchboard last night and they put him through to senators with Kavanaugh and
[07:39.360 --> 07:42.160]  then interrogated him and the woman said well I'm not going to tell you who I am or where
[07:42.160 --> 07:50.800]  I'm at but my daughter got raped by many years ago and I saw it.
[07:50.800 --> 07:58.760]  I mean this is total horsemaner, with Bill Cosby you had witnesses that were at the hotels
[07:58.760 --> 08:04.040]  with him, you had people that saw the women laid out, he was clearly giving them ludes,
[08:04.040 --> 08:08.360]  he admitted to it, he'd offer it to them, they'd take it, they'd get bombed out of
[08:08.360 --> 08:12.040]  their mind, I'm not saying that's a good thing, sounds like some type of form of sexual
[08:12.040 --> 08:20.480]  assault to me but with this, all five of the witnesses say it never even happened, they
[08:20.480 --> 08:25.920]  say there's not even a party, he's got alibis, he's got his original calendar, none of it
[08:25.920 --> 08:33.360]  matters because of the chivalry, why she's a woman, we have to believe her, anybody ever
[08:33.360 --> 08:39.400]  been in divorce court, you ever experience what that's like?
[08:39.400 --> 08:45.040]  Everybody knows it's especially women, most of the women I know are the ones that say
[08:45.040 --> 08:49.200]  this woman has no credibility, they see through her big time at men or all, oh well I don't
[08:49.200 --> 08:54.760]  want to say that, I want to make brownie points with all the women out there, oh my gosh and
[08:54.760 --> 09:01.080]  then you've got the high school annuals where it talks about she's the queen of the party,
[09:01.080 --> 09:05.960]  the wildest girl around and then they run junior high photos of her in the news when
[09:05.960 --> 09:11.080]  she's 11 years old and they go oh look at the sweet little school girl that got sexually
[09:11.080 --> 09:16.680]  assaulted, ladies and gentlemen my head is spinning and I agree with the president, a
[09:16.680 --> 09:23.280]  big fat con job perpetrated by very evil people, furious Trump accused the democrats
[09:23.280 --> 09:28.400]  of trying to destroy Brett Kavanaugh as nominee battles four sex claims but admits he could
[09:28.400 --> 09:34.200]  change his mind when he hears Christine Ford testify, well that's going on now and she's
[09:34.200 --> 09:38.320]  ongoing, we'll have all the highlights, we've got a ton of them here for you, David Knight's
[09:38.320 --> 09:48.040]  going to be riding shotgun here with us but I want to play what he talked about earlier
[09:48.040 --> 09:57.560]  David from 1991 the Anita Hill Clarence Thomas hearings with Joe Biden because they all want
[09:57.560 --> 10:01.480]  this FBI investigation to take six months to stall everything and you better believe
[10:01.480 --> 10:10.240]  that if we see his nomination derailed that they bring forth Amy Coney Barrett who's even
[10:10.240 --> 10:15.040]  better than Kavanaugh and who I pushed for and who Roger Stone pushed for and who Patriots
[10:15.040 --> 10:22.720]  pushed for, she's good looking, has a great record, super smart and very Christian and
[10:22.720 --> 10:26.720]  you're going to hear that she raped women, just mark my words, oh yeah, all that women
[10:26.720 --> 10:32.080]  come forward say, you know, she knocked my teeth out and has a black bull whip, it'll
[10:32.080 --> 10:36.880]  be black bull whip and a cat woman outfit, you think I'm joking, I know the enemy, cat
[10:36.880 --> 10:42.720]  woman outfit, bull whips, okay, now just like I told you last Tuesday they'll roll out three
[10:42.720 --> 10:49.520]  more women after her, the last one the night before or the morning of and total precision
[10:49.520 --> 10:56.640]  so far, now let's go ahead and go to Joe Biden, the political herpes that won't go away who's
[10:56.640 --> 11:01.080]  everywhere groping, women, children, grabbing men's wives in front of them, grabbing their
[11:01.080 --> 11:05.840]  rear ends, there's all these photos and videos of men bowing up and Senator Sessions coming
[11:05.840 --> 11:11.520]  over and like shooing, shooing and like swatting at the hand of Joe Biden when he's like grabbing
[11:11.520 --> 11:18.120]  the three year old's butt, I mean Joe Biden is a known super racist perv, so let's go
[11:18.120 --> 11:23.960]  to the super racist perv, here he is, I said from the beginning, this is about whether
[11:23.960 --> 11:39.520]  or not sexual harassment occurred, and lastly judge, with me from the beginning and at this
[11:39.520 --> 11:52.120]  moment until the end, the presumption is with you, now we're going to hear more witnesses
[11:52.120 --> 11:58.560]  are going to come in and cooperate, your position and hers, we'll find out whether they're
[11:58.560 --> 12:02.760]  telling the truth or not as best as we are capable of doing, just like you as a judge
[12:02.760 --> 12:10.680]  are when you look them in the eye and make a judgment, so judge this is less directed
[12:10.680 --> 12:23.440]  at you than it is to my pontificating colleagues, Democrat and Republican alike, so judge, I
[12:23.440 --> 12:32.640]  have not made my judgment based upon this proceeding because we have not heard all the
[12:32.640 --> 12:38.720]  evidence, and the last thing I'll point out, the next person that refers to an FBI report
[12:38.720 --> 12:48.520]  as being worth anything, obviously doesn't understand anything, FBI explicitly does not
[12:48.520 --> 13:00.400]  in this or any other case, reach a conclusion, period, period, so judge there's no reason
[13:00.400 --> 13:04.960]  why you should know this, the reason why we cannot rely on the FBI report, you wouldn't
[13:04.960 --> 13:14.840]  like it if we did, because it is inconclusive, they say he said, she said, and they said,
[13:14.840 --> 13:23.280]  period, so when people wave an FBI report before you, now let's finish that up, back
[13:23.280 --> 13:34.360]  it up for a second, do not, they do not, they do not reach conclusions, they do not make
[13:34.360 --> 13:41.040]  as my friend points out more adequate, they do not make recommendations, that's enough,
[13:41.040 --> 13:46.800]  isn't it interesting how things have changed in the last couple decades, hard to believe
[13:46.800 --> 13:53.880]  this is almost 30 years ago, that oh you're innocent until proven guilty and the FBI doesn't
[13:53.880 --> 14:00.080]  reach conclusions, and you can't just gaunt the reports as if they're findings of fact
[14:00.080 --> 14:05.240]  as the reports went to the side of Judge Thomas, so Biden's trying to ignore them, but what
[14:05.240 --> 14:14.600]  he's saying is legitimate, fast forward 28 years or whatever, and now the FBI is a bunch
[14:14.600 --> 14:18.520]  of total political operatives openly in their own text messages saying we're going to shut
[14:18.520 --> 14:22.560]  up the president elect, we're going to get rid of him, we're going to show he's guilty,
[14:22.560 --> 14:28.080]  we're threat fusion GPS, now it's admittedly was funded by George Soros of course, that's
[14:28.080 --> 14:32.120]  in the news today, we always knew that, that's coming out, the Washington Post reported on
[14:32.120 --> 14:38.560]  it, and so now you see the Democrats saying you cannot be confirmed, Kavanaugh, you've
[14:38.560 --> 14:46.840]  been accused, that's it, now there's an older zero hedge article, but let me just, since
[14:46.840 --> 14:50.080]  you mentioned the Soros thing, I'll pull it up for everybody right here, it's the Washington
[14:50.080 --> 14:58.400]  Post today, come back from break, we'll cover that, here it is, document cam shot please,
[14:58.400 --> 15:03.040]  here it is, towards Soros funded fusion GPS, his spokesman confirms Washington Post, okay,
[15:03.040 --> 15:08.080]  there you go, now, David Knight, we're going to break here, you're going to ride shotgun
[15:08.080 --> 15:11.760]  and through the hour and into the next with me, and I know you're really fired up about
[15:11.760 --> 15:16.480]  this, it's 30 seconds before we go to break, what is your first summation covering these
[15:16.480 --> 15:20.320]  disgusting hearings the last three hours before I got live?
[15:20.320 --> 15:26.480]  Well in spite of what Sheldon Richmond, or Sheldon White House, I should say, said, who's
[15:26.480 --> 15:32.640]  a senator from Rhode Island, there are not supported details in this, and as a matter
[15:32.640 --> 15:38.720]  of fact, she's very sketchy on all these details, whenever she does give us factual details,
[15:38.720 --> 15:45.240]  they are contradicted by her therapist, or they're contradicted by her lifelong friend,

[18:00.400 --> 18:05.720]  UFO Wars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[18:05.720 --> 18:11.040]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[18:11.040 --> 18:17.720]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[18:17.720 --> 18:23.600]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[18:23.600 --> 18:26.920]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[18:26.920 --> 18:31.840]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit
[18:31.840 --> 18:38.360]  of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[18:38.360 --> 18:41.760]  Pollen block is natural and effective, it is not an antihistamine.
[18:41.760 --> 18:46.520]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[18:46.520 --> 18:52.320]  triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[18:52.320 --> 18:55.040]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[18:55.040 --> 19:01.240]  Visit infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.

[20:21.800 --> 20:33.040]  Waging war on corruption, crashing to the lies of disinformation, covering the Ford
[20:33.040 --> 20:34.040]  Cavanaugh hearings.
[20:34.040 --> 20:39.480]  Now she's gone from being horrified to having a fun time.
[20:39.480 --> 20:42.880]  She's really somebody now.
[20:42.880 --> 20:49.640]  She's going to stop Donald Trump, she's going to stop America, look, her lawyer.
[20:49.640 --> 20:55.800]  It's the top swamp lawyer for Andy McCabe and George Soros, oh, I forgot he works for
[20:55.800 --> 20:56.800]  him too.
[20:56.800 --> 21:02.680]  Oh, it's just George Soros' top lawyer and the swamp's lawyer that openly works for
[21:02.680 --> 21:10.320]  Mueller, it's just Mueller and Comey's and McCabe's guy, there he is, veteran prosecutor
[21:10.320 --> 21:14.880]  Michael Bromwich joins Cavanaugh accusers legal team.
[21:14.880 --> 21:21.960]  Look at that little ferret, he'll teach America, you're not going to stop us America.
[21:21.960 --> 21:24.200]  We own you.
[21:24.200 --> 21:26.520]  David Knight is riding shotgun with me.
[21:26.520 --> 21:30.240]  Let's go to this clip from about 45 minutes ago and we'll get to some of the other low
[21:30.240 --> 21:36.400]  lights and get David to take care of a moment as we cover this electronic lynch mob.
[21:36.400 --> 21:42.240]  I mean, Cavanaugh is totally credible, comes off just like Clarence Thomas, he's telling
[21:42.240 --> 21:44.760]  the truth, plus her story's falling apart.
[21:44.760 --> 21:53.920]  This lady is a vicious fruit loop in my view and she's just part of this whole leftist
[21:53.920 --> 21:57.440]  slander machine in my view.
[21:57.440 --> 22:02.080]  You know, there's other men coming forward saying we were at a party and we might have
[22:02.080 --> 22:05.280]  been drunk and fallen on her on a bed.
[22:05.280 --> 22:09.120]  I don't believe any of it.
[22:09.120 --> 22:13.120]  We're going to get into some of the former prosecutor, the expert on sex crimes that
[22:13.120 --> 22:17.000]  cut her apart earlier, where oh, there was no music, what there was music and then they
[22:17.000 --> 22:20.360]  turned the music up and it's just, and then it was a party but there were five people
[22:20.360 --> 22:23.600]  but all five of them say there wasn't a party, never happened.
[22:23.600 --> 22:34.320]  Your witnesses say it didn't happen and it's 36 years ago, game over, dingbat, battleaxe.
[22:34.320 --> 22:39.200]  Just because you are a psychology professor that lords over your students that call you
[22:39.200 --> 22:47.600]  mean and vindictive, just because you're the chief cook and bottle washer around here,
[22:47.600 --> 22:51.720]  doesn't mean you get to run America in the ground and here's the good news, no matter
[22:51.720 --> 22:58.560]  what happens at Kavanaugh, America is getting battle hardened to the satanic left now.
[22:58.560 --> 23:03.560]  You know, have they asked her about how they said she was Mrs. Party Animal in the high
[23:03.560 --> 23:08.120]  school annuals and describe her passing out and how much she loved to forget what happened
[23:08.120 --> 23:13.280]  because it let her do whatever she wanted, none of that's being brought up, none of it.
[23:13.280 --> 23:18.320]  I'm so angry, I can barely even do this broadcast, let's go to the clip of Senator Durbin making
[23:18.320 --> 23:22.480]  a good point about, you know, oh, you seem horrified, oh, well, you know, there's men
[23:22.480 --> 23:28.840]  come forward, stories are on infowars.com and they believe that that's where the story
[23:28.840 --> 23:33.680]  came from, not her, but again, you're not seeing much of this being covered as the plot
[23:33.680 --> 23:41.160]  thickens, so let's go to this clip.
[23:41.160 --> 23:49.880]  And then we will go back to David Knight here today, we'll go to that clip later, okay.
[23:49.880 --> 23:56.720]  Defense of mistaken identity directly, Dr. Ford, with what degree of certainty do you
[23:56.720 --> 24:06.560]  believe Brett Kavanaugh assaulted you? 100%. In the letter which you sent to Senator Feinstein,
[24:06.560 --> 24:12.560]  you wrote, I have not knowingly seen Kavanaugh since the assault, I did see Mark Judge once
[24:12.560 --> 24:18.320]  at the Potomac Village Safeway where he was extremely uncomfortable in seeing me. Would
[24:18.320 --> 24:22.880]  you please describe that encounter at the Safeway with Mark Judge and what led you to
[24:22.880 --> 24:30.000]  believe he was uncomfortable? Yes, I was going to the Potomac Village Safeway,
[24:30.000 --> 24:36.280]  this is the one on the corner of Falls and River Road, and I was with my mother and I
[24:36.280 --> 24:43.400]  was a teenager, so I wanted her to go in one door and me go in the other, so I chose the
[24:43.400 --> 24:47.680]  wrong door because the door I chose was the one where Mark Judge was.
[24:47.680 --> 24:53.840]  And then she goes on to say 100% that it was Kavanaugh, and the reason I bring this up
[24:53.840 --> 25:00.040]  is none of this story holds together, and you've got Hillary and the globalists fighting
[25:00.040 --> 25:03.680]  the Arab Spring that killed hundreds of thousands of people per country, tens of thousands of
[25:03.680 --> 25:08.120]  women and children in sex slavery, Hillary famously represents pedophiles, you've got
[25:08.120 --> 25:14.200]  them trying to put boys' intents with girls and in girls' bathrooms at the Boy Scouts
[25:14.200 --> 25:19.480]  of America, they're teaching newborn babies that they are not boys or not girls, they
[25:19.480 --> 25:24.240]  are running around sexualizing our children, Hollywood is a cesspit, and you've got deep
[25:24.240 --> 25:32.440]  state swamp lawyers swimming around up front, completely predatorally, and it's just ridiculous
[25:32.440 --> 25:35.760]  how these people are playing us like a fiddle. I'm going to get to more of these highlights
[25:35.760 --> 25:39.560]  in a moment, David Knight, we've got the raw satellite feed and a lot more coming up and
[25:39.560 --> 25:44.320]  some of her statement, of course we'll cover Kavanaugh, Gabel to Gabel as that unfolds,
[25:44.320 --> 25:49.600]  but what is your gut level now that you've seen her testify and seen this spectacle
[25:49.600 --> 25:56.200]  and to see that swamp top lawyer of the Clinton apparatus perched right beside her, I mean
[25:56.200 --> 25:59.000]  to me this is as phony as a plastic banana.
[25:59.000 --> 26:03.520]  Yeah, you know Alex, she said that she's 100% certain, but she doesn't have much in
[26:03.520 --> 26:08.480]  terms of detail, and what she does have in terms of detail is supported by other people.
[26:08.480 --> 26:12.000]  One that's testimony earlier today, Alex, she talked about Laylin, and of course that's
[26:12.000 --> 26:17.520]  the person that she said was her lifelong friend, Laylin Kaiser. Now Laylin Kaiser's
[26:17.520 --> 26:23.160]  lawyer, and purportedly she was, Laylin was supposed to be at this party or this gathering
[26:23.160 --> 26:28.040]  whatever it was, she was supposed to have been there along with Christine Ford and the three
[26:28.040 --> 26:32.320]  named individuals, one of them being Brett Kavanaugh, the other Mark Judge, Patrick Smith
[26:32.320 --> 26:38.320]  and so forth. Now everybody has said, except for Christine Ford, that this didn't happen.
[26:38.320 --> 26:42.720]  So all the other four people said it didn't happen, including her lifelong friend. As
[26:42.720 --> 26:47.880]  a matter of fact, her lawyer, the lawyer for the lifelong friend, Laylin Kaiser, said simply
[26:47.880 --> 26:52.880]  put Ms. Kaiser does not know Mr. Kavanaugh, she has no recollection of ever being at a
[26:52.880 --> 26:59.680]  party or gathering where he was present, either with or without Dr. Ford. And so every time
[26:59.680 --> 27:04.240]  you look at the details here, as a matter of fact, she doesn't know exactly where this
[27:04.240 --> 27:08.560]  took place. She remembers, as you just played that, she remembers going to a particular
[27:08.560 --> 27:14.480]  grocery store where Mark Judge was working, but she doesn't remember anything about this
[27:14.480 --> 27:15.480]  house.
[27:15.480 --> 27:19.360]  We're also going to play this clip later when we come back, where she says, I remembered
[27:19.360 --> 27:24.800]  the assault when the media came to my house and there was a dog and you're like, she could
[27:24.800 --> 27:27.000]  just be completely insane as well.
[27:27.000 --> 27:31.440]  Well, one of the things she said was, she doesn't remember the house, she doesn't remember
[27:31.440 --> 27:35.600]  the street, she doesn't remember the day, the month, and she doesn't even really remember
[27:35.600 --> 27:39.840]  the year because she inferred it. And she said in her testimony earlier today, she said,
[27:39.840 --> 27:44.800]  well, I think it was that year because it was before I was driving, so I was 15. Well,
[27:44.800 --> 27:48.440]  okay, so it was before you were driving. How did you get to and from this house? I mean,
[27:48.440 --> 27:52.760]  there's so many holes in the details of this and that's really what the issue is. Again,
[27:52.760 --> 27:57.200]  she deserves to be heard, but she doesn't deserve to be believed. And she has to be credible
[27:57.200 --> 27:59.840]  on these details and she's not, she's contradicted on these details.
[27:59.840 --> 28:03.440]  Do you agree with me that she is one of the worst witnesses I've ever seen?
[28:03.440 --> 28:08.360]  Yeah. And I think that what we have seen from Abinadi in the last 24 hours is even worse.
[28:08.360 --> 28:13.320]  And I think it's going to energize the Republican base. They understand what this is all about.
[28:13.320 --> 28:17.640]  They've seen this kind of obstruction happening over the last two years with President Trump.
[28:17.640 --> 28:23.920]  They've seen the coup and so forth. And I think that this is the ultimate unraveling,
[28:23.920 --> 28:27.640]  I hope it is at least, of all of this identity politics stuff.
[28:27.640 --> 28:31.680]  I agree. This is going to the nth degree.
[28:31.680 --> 28:36.160]  We got a bunch of clips coming up. I'm so upset by them tearing our country apart like
[28:36.160 --> 28:41.960]  this and the obvious lies here and this thing being completely fake in front of everyone
[28:41.960 --> 28:47.960]  and then still watching the senators fall over themselves to grovel to this leftist,
[28:47.960 --> 28:54.160]  Hillary worshiping Democrat party operative with swamp creatures to her left and right
[28:54.160 --> 28:59.440]  puppeteering her.

[31:29.320 --> 31:34.640]  and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive, to

[32:05.400 --> 32:10.480]  here in Leilani Estates, but a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need
[32:10.480 --> 32:14.000]  to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[32:14.000 --> 32:19.400]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water
[32:19.400 --> 32:26.200]  to unhealthy levels. To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity
[32:26.200 --> 32:31.040]  and pH. What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and
[32:31.040 --> 32:32.800]  acidity in the rainwater.
[32:32.800 --> 32:38.200]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy
[32:38.200 --> 32:44.280]  metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels. As
[32:44.280 --> 32:49.920]  it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water. So what we've
[32:49.920 --> 32:55.480]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply. But more
[32:55.480 --> 33:02.480]  importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[33:26.480 --> 33:32.480]  The Alex Jones Show. Because there is a war on, or your mind.
[33:32.480 --> 33:39.080]  I've said it many times, if you go to these universities or go to leftist areas, I don't
[33:39.080 --> 33:45.920]  care, they're black, white, old, young, the people look like something's wrong with them.
[33:45.920 --> 33:51.840]  And she looks like the quintessential just nut professor. And the ratings on her said
[33:51.840 --> 33:58.840]  she's horrible, vindictive, lazy. There she is. She's the big star now. 36 years later,
[34:00.280 --> 34:05.400]  all her witnesses say it didn't happen. Doesn't matter. She's up there smiling. She's gonna
[34:05.400 --> 34:12.400]  save America from America. Look at her. It's so pleased. She's pleased as pie. She's looking
[34:15.160 --> 34:19.440]  up the Democratic senators smiling like a little doggy. Did I do good? Am I doing good
[34:19.440 --> 34:25.200]  for the swamp creatures holding my hand? For McCabe and Comey's lawyers? And the answer
[34:25.200 --> 34:30.040]  is yes, you're doing a very good job. And then when the Republicans talked to her, she
[34:30.040 --> 34:36.040]  went, we're sorry, we're sorry. You're right. Kavanaugh, we'll have Kavanaugh executed,
[34:36.040 --> 34:42.720]  okay? And then the headlines. I've got them right here. Last night, an anonymous woman
[34:42.720 --> 34:46.440]  called the switchboard and was put through and she says she saw her daughter raped by
[34:46.440 --> 34:53.440]  him. She wouldn't say where she was or what year, but that's a fourth person. Ring ring.
[34:53.440 --> 34:58.240]  Oh, random. No call already. And that's the new thing. I told you about this when I got
[34:58.240 --> 35:03.880]  doxxed five days ago. They put my cell phone number out. I have to get a new phone and
[35:03.880 --> 35:09.640]  I have women calling up saying, oh, I saw you in DC, but I had a really good time. Let's
[35:09.640 --> 35:17.520]  meet again. I'm like, I was with no women in DC. Another call. Oh, I had fun with you,
[35:17.520 --> 35:23.360]  but you know, you were a little bit rough and I'm just like, click block number and
[35:23.360 --> 35:31.200]  then men call them and say, F you, we're going to get you. That's who these people are. So
[35:31.200 --> 35:36.000]  I guess they might just randomly call the capital switchboard and say I raped somebody. In fact,
[35:36.000 --> 35:40.320]  I thought about calling the capital switchboard myself and going, hello, my name's Alice,
[35:40.320 --> 35:44.600]  but I'm not going to tell you who I am or where I am. Brett Kavanaugh gang raped me
[35:44.600 --> 35:55.320]  with 14 elves. Yes, it was 49 years ago. And Brett Kavanaugh, he also played my skin and
[35:55.320 --> 36:01.240]  pulled my fingernails out with pliers. And then he had an electric drill and he drilled
[36:01.240 --> 36:06.480]  my kneecaps. Yes, ma'am. We're very sorry. Now this is anonymous. I'm not going to tell
[36:06.480 --> 36:13.120]  you where we're in just okay. Kavanaugh evil. Click on anonymous accuser says Kavanaugh
[36:13.120 --> 36:19.480]  drilled their kneecaps with a black and decker drill. I'm going to play these clips and go
[36:19.480 --> 36:23.200]  back to David. I need to maybe leave the room for a few minutes because this is just, I
[36:23.200 --> 36:28.600]  can't look at her. It's like Hillary. This is just a bug eyed vampire bat look that these
[36:28.600 --> 36:35.360]  people have. And just knowing how she sits and perches, you know, on top of her students
[36:35.360 --> 36:40.400]  and just these universities are these anti free speech lie machines. And I've experienced
[36:40.400 --> 36:49.120]  the left and their victory all like fraud and their disinformation. So maybe I'm biased.
[36:49.120 --> 36:56.320]  But what I know is top swamp creature lawyer right there of the deep state. And I got some
[36:56.320 --> 37:01.440]  big Twitter news coming up. So let's go and start getting these clips here. And the David's
[37:01.440 --> 37:05.120]  I got a lot he wants to get to two. So we'll go to him in a moment. I'm really trying to
[37:05.120 --> 37:09.440]  compose myself right now. Here's President Trump saying guilty until proven innocent
[37:09.440 --> 37:20.520]  is very, very dangerous. Yeah, guilty until proven innocent. That is what you call tyranny.
[37:20.520 --> 37:28.760]  Here it is. This is everything to do with our country. When you are guilty until proven
[37:28.760 --> 37:35.680]  innocent. It's just not supposed to be that way. Always I heard you're innocent until
[37:35.680 --> 37:41.520]  proven guilty. I've heard this for so long. And it's such a beautiful phrase. In this
[37:41.520 --> 37:49.360]  case, you're guilty until proven innocent. I think that is a very, very dangerous standard
[37:49.360 --> 37:56.040]  for our country. With that being said, I look forward to what she has to say. I also look
[37:56.040 --> 38:04.360]  very forward to what Judge Kavanaugh has to say. I think it's going to be a very, very
[38:04.360 --> 38:13.760]  important day in the history of our country. I want to start getting some of her statement.
[38:13.760 --> 38:16.360]  And then you can compare it to her hours later. She looks like she's having the town of her
[38:16.360 --> 38:23.440]  life and the whole demeanor is different. It's just mind blowing, absolutely mind blowing.
[38:23.440 --> 38:28.720]  But going back to David, not before we start playing these clips of Christine Ford, it's
[38:28.720 --> 38:34.160]  all going to hinge on what Kavanaugh comes out and says today and it's all going to hinge
[38:34.160 --> 38:38.240]  on Trump sticking by him and us sticking by him because now we're sticking by due process.
[38:38.240 --> 38:43.840]  We're sticking by common sense. We're sticking by the facts, David, and we're sticking by
[38:43.840 --> 38:49.200]  the statute of limitations. I mean, this is Salem witch trial type stuff. Well, how do
[38:49.200 --> 38:55.480]  you know she's a witch? Well, she's got a mole on her nose. This is really upsetting
[38:55.480 --> 39:03.120]  me at a level I've not yet been upset by. What is your view on this fiasco? I mean, this
[39:03.120 --> 39:04.120]  is...
[39:04.120 --> 39:08.160]  Yeah, it is a witch hunt. It is a witch hunt. It's the witches that are hunting right now.
[39:08.160 --> 39:13.960]  Now, going back to the Joe Biden thing, Alex, I remember those hearings. I was taking a
[39:13.960 --> 39:18.240]  vacation with my wife at the time and other than the arrogance of Joe Biden that you could
[39:18.240 --> 39:21.360]  see in that clip when we played that, the thing that I remember about those hearings
[39:21.360 --> 39:26.180]  was how he hammered Clarence Thomas over the idea that Clarence Thomas believed that we
[39:26.180 --> 39:31.280]  as individuals had natural rights. And I thought at the time, I said, this is outrageous.
[39:31.280 --> 39:34.760]  Why isn't this what everybody is talking about? Because that's what the Declaration of Independence
[39:34.760 --> 39:39.800]  is about, the fact that we have natural rights because we're humans, because we were given
[39:39.800 --> 39:45.680]  that by God and so forth. And Joe Biden hated that about Clarence Thomas. And then we move
[39:45.680 --> 39:52.840]  forward. It was only six years, seven years after that, that Anita Hill and all the Democrats
[39:52.840 --> 39:58.440]  did not believe when either Broderick or Kathleen Willey or Paula Jones, they didn't have a
[39:58.440 --> 40:03.400]  right to be heard or believed. And so I saw all that hypocrisy and that really factors
[40:03.400 --> 40:07.200]  into all this. I'll say one more thing here too. And that is this process. I don't really
[40:07.200 --> 40:10.960]  think this serves the Republicans well. I think that Grassley has been played by Schumer
[40:10.960 --> 40:15.000]  and these other people. And I think this whole process where they got a female special counsel,
[40:15.000 --> 40:22.080]  she's going in and questioning Ford on details is very dry, is very arcane. She's not drawing
[40:22.080 --> 40:26.280]  any conclusions. And she has a short period of time, she asks these questions, and then
[40:26.280 --> 40:31.440]  they switch over abruptly to a Democrat. And the Democrats will lay out all these conclusions
[40:31.440 --> 40:36.240]  and summarize everything in a very visceral and emotional way for Dr. Ford. And then she'll
[40:36.240 --> 40:40.200]  just go, Oh, yeah, that's right. That's exactly the way that it is. This is not serving the
[40:40.200 --> 40:44.560]  Republicans very well on this. It's going to really hinge on Brett Kavanaugh and how
[40:44.560 --> 40:47.280]  he does. I don't really know how that process is going to work. I don't know who's going
[40:47.280 --> 40:51.120]  to be questioning him over these issues. But the way they've got this going back and forth
[40:51.120 --> 40:55.040]  between the female special counsel and the Democrat senators who are covering for her
[40:55.040 --> 41:00.760]  is really not a good idea. And next hour, because they're going to launch here soon,
[41:00.760 --> 41:05.720]  we were going to play large segments of the cross examination. And the lady's overly
[41:05.720 --> 41:13.000]  nice to her. It's very, very sappy. But she does just find total contradictions everywhere.
[41:13.000 --> 41:16.920]  I mean, if this was... Oh, yeah, a lot of contradictions. Yeah. And if she would hammer
[41:16.920 --> 41:20.800]  on those, she doesn't draw the conclusions on this. She'll say some things. She'll hammer,
[41:20.800 --> 41:26.280]  put the stuff out there, just like the therapist. The therapist was taking notes concurrent with
[41:26.280 --> 41:32.640]  what was going on. She had written notes going back six years. And in those notes, Dr. Ford
[41:32.640 --> 41:36.520]  was saying there were four boys there. Now she says there's two. In those notes, Ford
[41:36.520 --> 41:40.280]  said that she was in her later teens. Now she says, well, I think because I wasn't driving
[41:40.280 --> 41:46.240]  at the time, I was maybe 15. But we're supposed to believe Ford and her memory, which she
[41:46.240 --> 41:50.880]  is very, very sketchy on all the details, but not believe what the therapist wrote down
[41:50.880 --> 41:55.240]  at the time. And of course, one of the things that is key about this is that according to
[41:55.240 --> 42:02.240]  her recollection, Dr. Ford said that she used Brett Kavanaugh's name at that therapy session.
[42:02.240 --> 42:07.920]  And there's nothing about his name in those notes either. And so all of this looks like
[42:07.920 --> 42:12.360]  this is something that is convenient for the Democrats, convenient for a political agenda,
[42:12.360 --> 42:13.360]  but it doesn't have anything to do with the actual...
[42:13.360 --> 42:20.520]  Well, of course it is. And now, as I predicted, three more women, four total, exactly as I
[42:20.520 --> 42:25.240]  predicted, I'm not bragging, it's just true, because I can see the formality of this. And
[42:25.240 --> 42:30.960]  now he may never get confirmed because they'll probably have 20 more by next week. I mean,
[42:30.960 --> 42:34.520]  it's going to just get more and more outlandish. And it just gives you an idea that we have
[42:34.520 --> 42:41.320]  a real crop of globalist trash up there in Schumer and all these people. But that's
[42:41.320 --> 42:46.880]  their Achilles heel too, because I agree with David Knight. This is really turning America
[42:46.880 --> 42:52.360]  off to these people. Everybody I know is seeing right through this, especially after Ford got
[42:52.360 --> 42:59.720]  up there and testified. He is the most disingenuous person I think I've ever seen.
[42:59.720 --> 43:04.880]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now. Info
[43:04.880 --> 43:09.320]  Awards is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, left to CIA operatives, the corrupt
[43:09.320 --> 43:14.080]  justice department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate. People say, why would you start
[43:14.080 --> 43:18.840]  a fight with them? Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[43:18.840 --> 43:23.800]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this. So we've already had incredible success.
[43:23.800 --> 43:28.680]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is and understand how real this fight is and
[43:28.680 --> 43:33.520]  why we've been made the main target, and if you financially support us and if you spread
[43:33.520 --> 43:39.240]  the word about our articles and videos, infowars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against
[43:39.240 --> 43:44.720]  these brutal scum bags, we'll win. We have huge sales at infowars.com right now. And
[43:44.720 --> 43:48.760]  we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite
[43:48.760 --> 43:52.560]  the fact we're trying to block our commerce and you're right to the market. But if you
[43:52.560 --> 43:56.480]  don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and Global Spain win. This is InfoWars

[47:03.560 --> 47:19.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. From the front lines of the Information War,
[47:19.600 --> 47:22.680]  Alex Jones.
[47:22.680 --> 47:29.940]  By the way, I'm not joking, I'm kind of having an anxiety attack on air right now, and I'm
[47:29.940 --> 47:34.360]  a tough guy, I could take a lot of crap, but these very people, these very democratic
[47:34.360 --> 47:39.000]  operatives have been trying to ruin my life and take my kids away and lying about me and
[47:39.000 --> 47:46.800]  I'm sick of it. But they're a bunch of fricking scum. That's why I'm really pissed off. These
[47:46.800 --> 47:53.560]  law firms and these people, these very sane people. I had Mueller try to set me up a few
[47:53.560 --> 48:00.240]  weeks ago and I can't even talk about it yet. So I'm going to let David Knight take over
[48:00.240 --> 48:05.880]  for this segment. I'm sorry, I got to go walk around or something because I'm trying to
[48:05.880 --> 48:11.640]  not get angry and I usually control my anger, David, but I saw you get angry too this morning.
[48:11.640 --> 48:18.200]  How did you get so angry? I mean, this is not justice. This isn't even what third world
[48:18.200 --> 48:24.800]  countries do and just to know the left is really this bad. I mean, they published that
[48:24.800 --> 48:29.880]  I wear Nazi tennis shoes and hate black people and then they get people to lie a hundred
[48:29.880 --> 48:35.440]  percent that I never did anything to. It's like, where are the morals? What is wrong
[48:35.440 --> 48:38.720]  with this country? Go ahead, David.
[48:38.720 --> 48:43.600]  Well, Alex, what I got upset about was the fact that I've been put in Twitter jail for
[48:43.600 --> 48:48.120]  a week, evidently, because yesterday I had the audacity to talk about the transgender
[48:48.120 --> 48:54.800]  agenda and how all these Democrats who pretend that they are there to protect women and children
[48:54.800 --> 48:59.480]  are doing just the opposite. They're demanding and it was just a couple of years ago. The
[48:59.480 --> 49:04.240]  Obama administration was threatening to penalize schools that didn't allow physically male
[49:04.240 --> 49:10.440]  individuals to go into dressing rooms and bathrooms and showers and so forth with girls.
[49:10.440 --> 49:15.440]  Remember Cuomo tweeted two years ago that if your 11-year-old daughter doesn't want
[49:15.440 --> 49:20.040]  to see a man come in the shower at her school, that you're a bigot and she's a bigot.
[49:20.040 --> 49:24.640]  Yeah, exactly. Exactly. So let's do something about that. Let's protect them and let's talk
[49:24.640 --> 49:28.320]  about the statute of limitations, especially when you hear all these Democrats talking
[49:28.320 --> 49:32.120]  about how, well, it's so long ago, it's just really hard for me to remember all the details.
[49:32.120 --> 49:36.360]  I just have a visceral impression of the attack and I remember the individual, but I don't
[49:36.360 --> 49:40.680]  remember any other details. Well, okay, and they keep saying, well, this happens all the
[49:40.680 --> 49:44.760]  time. People take a long time to come to terms with this and that is true. And if they were
[49:44.760 --> 49:50.080]  concerned about protecting people, again, especially children who have an even longer
[49:50.080 --> 49:55.600]  amount of time that it takes them to come to detail to bring this out, stop the statute
[49:55.600 --> 50:00.760]  of limitations on attacks against kids, which are typically only about three years. We're
[50:00.760 --> 50:06.240]  talking about them. The Democrats are fighting in Pennsylvania and other areas to keep the
[50:06.240 --> 50:10.760]  statute of limitations because they want to protect the pedophile rings. You're absolutely
[50:10.760 --> 50:15.240]  correct. And I was going to get to the Twitter thing later. So let's do that next hour.
[50:15.240 --> 50:21.240]  We have fan pages that sent us this information as well. Some of these aren't even Twitters.
[50:21.240 --> 50:24.440]  We don't really use Twitter anymore because they all the big ones they banned. Paul still
[50:24.440 --> 50:30.160]  has his. They said, because I criticized Obama and the deep state. Wait till you see the
[50:30.160 --> 50:36.240]  tweet coming up that it was hateful. There it is. Let me read you. Since David raises,
[50:36.240 --> 50:39.040]  let me just go ahead and get to this now. You know what? I'm going to wait till next
[50:39.040 --> 50:44.280]  hour. It's too huge. It's too insane. Wait till you hear the tweet that they say is racist.
[50:44.280 --> 50:49.800]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this is unbelievable. Wait till you hear this. Criticizing Obama,
[50:49.800 --> 50:54.480]  period, is now racist. You will be banned from Twitter. But David, since we talk about
[50:54.480 --> 50:58.640]  this, let's start getting the clips of her. Here she is bizarrely, just like I predicted
[50:58.640 --> 51:02.440]  last week when I said there would be three more women. That's four total by the day of
[51:02.440 --> 51:12.240]  the hearing. So by Thursday. And if you pull back from this, I also said every woman that
[51:12.240 --> 51:19.200]  was ever in the same town as Kavanaugh, college, high school, you name it, was being canvassed
[51:19.200 --> 51:23.680]  by databases and reporters. And she had mixed that. She decided to start going public when
[51:23.680 --> 51:28.800]  the reporters are looking through her window at her dog. And this has happened to me and
[51:28.800 --> 51:31.880]  everybody else that's prominent that works here. They call everyone that ever knew you
[51:31.880 --> 51:37.200]  or they think knows you and they start offering cash to lie. Now, that's what I'm saying
[51:37.200 --> 51:41.520]  is the left has gone pure weaponized folks. They're not even media. They are organized
[51:41.520 --> 51:50.720]  crime mafias. CNN is a criminal news network. So here is Ms. Ford before the electronic
[51:50.720 --> 51:56.240]  lynching of Kavanaugh. When she decided to do this, just as I said she did. Here it is.
[51:56.240 --> 52:02.400]  How did you decide to come forward? Ultimately, because reporters were sitting outside of my
[52:02.400 --> 52:10.500]  home and trying to talk to my dog through the window to calm the dog down. And a reporter
[52:10.500 --> 52:17.960]  appeared in my graduate classroom and I mistook her for a student. And she came up to ask
[52:17.960 --> 52:24.920]  me a question and I thought that she was a student and it turned out that she was a reporter.
[52:24.920 --> 52:30.600]  So at that point I felt like enough was enough. People were calling my colleagues at Stanford
[52:30.600 --> 52:36.360]  and leaving messages on their voicemails and on their emails saying that they knew my name.
[52:36.360 --> 52:40.960]  Clearly people knew my address because they were out in front of my house. And it's just
[52:40.960 --> 52:46.520]  the mounting pressure. It seemed like it was time to just say what I needed to say.
[52:46.520 --> 52:53.520]  I'm sorry. I want to ask you one question about the attack itself.
[52:53.520 --> 53:03.400]  You can pause again. The attack. Now it's the attack, see? Well, again, David Knight,
[53:03.400 --> 53:06.880]  she decided to do it because the reporters came to her. There you go, David.
[53:06.880 --> 53:11.040]  Yeah. This is kind of interesting because you know this other individual who said, I'm
[53:11.040 --> 53:13.960]  not going to talk, her lawyer said, well, just read the New Yorker, you know, those
[53:13.960 --> 53:18.200]  Ronan Farrow's story. And the New York Times said we didn't find that credible. We talked
[53:18.200 --> 53:24.280]  to a dozen different people that didn't find Ramirez's story credible. Now, Ronan Farrow
[53:24.280 --> 53:27.720]  went on with George Stephanopoulos and he was questioning him about that. And at the
[53:27.720 --> 53:32.320]  time he said, you know, you know, she took six days to talk to her lawyer and to go back
[53:32.320 --> 53:37.240]  and pour over her memories to try to, you know, fix this. And we thought it was important
[53:37.240 --> 53:41.520]  to go ahead and put this story out because she was being pressured by Democrats and put
[53:41.520 --> 53:45.200]  it into a corner. And so we know that this is what's happening. We know the Democrats
[53:45.200 --> 53:51.160]  are pressuring them to come up with some solution to come up with some delays and so forth.
[53:51.160 --> 53:56.920]  And Ronan Farrow actually mentioned that that was the case for the Democrats. And then in
[53:56.920 --> 54:02.400]  subsequent press conferences, you had two Democrat senators that were asked point blank.
[54:02.400 --> 54:06.040]  Did you pressure her to do this? And what did you know about Ramirez and so forth? And
[54:06.040 --> 54:10.800]  so she's not going to be testifying. And she was the second person who came out. She's
[54:10.800 --> 54:13.280]  just referring back to this discredited story.
[54:13.280 --> 54:19.880]  And that's the thing, David. It's every witness says the opposite of what these women say.
[54:19.880 --> 54:23.440]  And then with some of these women, as you just mentioned, Ramirez, we're learning about
[54:23.440 --> 54:28.760]  restraining orders and women saying that they threatened them and anger management issues
[54:28.760 --> 54:34.560]  and all sorts of weird stuff in their background. And they're all a bunch of psychology professor
[54:34.560 --> 54:38.920]  lunatics in my view. Everybody knows that, you know, most of these psychologists, you
[54:38.920 --> 54:42.280]  know, got the inmates running the asylum. I mean, the highest rate of suicide of any
[54:42.280 --> 54:46.120]  profession is psychologists and psychiatrists. Most of them get into it because they're crazier
[54:46.120 --> 54:49.440]  than a, you know, what house rat.
[54:49.440 --> 54:50.440]  So
[54:50.440 --> 54:55.400]  Right. Well, you know, one of the things about this, the statement from Christine Ford, if
[54:55.400 --> 55:00.440]  you look at it, it's very sketchy on details. And it's about a five page or a written type
[55:00.440 --> 55:05.400]  out statement here. And there's less than a page that actually has to do with the alleged
[55:05.400 --> 55:09.560]  attack. But one of the things that she says here, I'll read from her report, I remember
[55:09.560 --> 55:16.040]  my friend, Lailin Ingham, attending. Well, Lailin doesn't remember that. And she continues
[55:16.040 --> 55:21.320]  to talk about as if Lailin is, and Lailin has been very emphatic. I never was at this
[55:21.320 --> 55:22.320]  party.
[55:22.320 --> 55:24.320]  I was never at any party. I never met Brett Kavanaugh.
[55:24.320 --> 55:28.720]  For weeks have been saying she's wrong. And she's testifying still using them. Like, you
[55:28.720 --> 55:34.360]  know, David Knight, David Knight, you know, you know, saw me climb Mount Everest. And
[55:34.360 --> 55:38.000]  David's like, no, I never been to Tibet, never saw him climb Mount Everest. Yeah, David was
[55:38.000 --> 55:41.680]  there. And David vouches for the fact that I can fly around and I have wings. They was
[55:41.680 --> 55:46.560]  like, no, I, but David says, David says, you know, I mean, it's crazy.
[55:46.560 --> 55:52.160]  Yeah. And you know, her friend Lailin is a female. And so she deserves to be believed
[55:52.160 --> 55:55.160]  as well. I mean, I know we just throw out all these other men who were there because
[55:55.160 --> 55:59.560]  men can't be believed. But Lailin, her lifelong friend says, I wasn't there. And she continues
[55:59.560 --> 56:04.320]  to put it in her statement, continued to use it today. And it has been totally refuted
[56:04.320 --> 56:08.600]  by Lailin. And so that's indicative of what is throughout this thing. Also, she says,
[56:08.600 --> 56:11.920]  well, I don't have any answers. And I don't remember as much as I would like to. I've
[56:11.920 --> 56:19.080]  been asked about all these details, but 100% he assaulted me. I don't remember where I
[56:19.080 --> 56:24.080]  was, how old, how I got there, where the hell it was. But it's him. It's him. It's
[56:24.080 --> 56:28.200]  him. And the psychologists don't say it. And no, they don't either. Because everything
[56:28.200 --> 56:33.240]  you say is absolute BS. David, stay there. We're going to come back and we're going
[56:33.240 --> 56:36.240]  to get into more of the clubs. They've got lunch coming. You know, they're going to
[56:36.240 --> 56:40.880]  lunch and then we're going to have her come finish back and then in the cabin always going
[56:40.880 --> 56:44.320]  to come in. We're going to cover that gavel to gavel because quite frankly, I'm trying
[56:44.320 --> 56:47.920]  to spare everybody watching and listening to her is just like nails on the chalkboard.
[56:47.920 --> 56:54.280]  But I'm looking at her. It's not that she's old or wrinkled. It's the spirit of these
[56:54.280 --> 57:00.000]  people just makes me want to climb the walls, man. The disingenuousness, the sneakiness,
[57:00.000 --> 57:04.920]  the weakness, the, the fallen nature, you know, the groveling to the Democrats, the frowning
[57:04.920 --> 57:11.040]  at the Republicans, the, the lapdog, you know, sycophantic behavior is disgusting. And it's
[57:11.040 --> 57:15.880]  time for good people to take this country back, ladies and gentlemen, because I can't
[57:15.880 --> 57:20.120]  handle it anymore. And I know you can't handle it. And they want our children, my God, they
[57:20.120 --> 57:24.680]  want to start giving them chemicals at birth to change their quote gender. It is insane.
[57:24.680 --> 57:27.400]  I've been so upset. I haven't even plugged a day without your financial support. George
[57:27.400 --> 57:31.880]  Soros and the globalist will win. We have huge specials in four store.com. Brain force

[57:57.000 --> 58:02.860]  medicine with bodies. Bodies contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[58:02.860 --> 58:07.200]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[58:07.200 --> 58:12.080]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties. Our pure turmeric
[58:12.080 --> 58:16.960]  extract plus peppering from black pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support
[58:16.960 --> 58:23.160]  your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system and so much more. Regular turmeric
[58:23.160 --> 58:28.400]  root from the store only contains 1 to 5% of active ingredients, but our turmeric root
[58:28.400 --> 58:35.080]  extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients. Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs
[58:35.080 --> 58:41.680]  such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.

[59:17.160 --> 59:22.800]  of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever that everyone go to infowars.com

[59:48.640 --> 59:53.080]  and we are winning.
[59:53.080 --> 01:00:19.080]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:48.920]  All right. I've gotten old fashioned angry. I've been more
[01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:56.360]  calm over the years, but I just watching this miscarriage of justice and the insanity of
[01:00:56.360 --> 01:01:03.400]  the Kavanaugh witch hunt, electronic lynching. I mean, if you thought the Clarence Thomas
[01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:10.520]  gang gang up was bad, this is just unbelievable. And again, as funny as the $3 bill, the Democrats
[01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:15.080]  are the ones the long history of abusing women and being into weird stuff and then having
[01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:19.840]  a double standard for themselves. Next segment, I'm going to ask David Knight this critical
[01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:25.600]  question. I want to do it now. Some stations don't carry this segment. Gut level. I want
[01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:31.960]  to get this called out now. Will Kavanaugh yet confirm now? He should. He better. We'll
[01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:40.680]  talk about the reasons why, but I think it's all up to Trump and all up to us. But regardless,
[01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:47.320]  the good is coming out of this because this is so transparent and so over the top that
[01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:51.240]  this is going to really harden the resolve of the American people that we have cancer
[01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:56.240]  in this country. The Democrats are not a viable party at any level. They are. They are a lawless
[01:01:56.240 --> 01:02:03.040]  group of criminals that have degenerated to a level of just pure megalomania. And so it's
[01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:08.160]  us or them and it's a battle to the end. It's a death battle. I don't mean physical death
[01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:13.240]  battle means it's, it's, it's no holds bar, no quarter given, none taken. They will break
[01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:18.160]  any rule. They will do anything. They get caught doing it. It's in the WikiLeaks, but,
[01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:21.600]  but, but, and we're also going to play our statement about, Oh, I thought he was going
[01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:27.520]  to kill me. I thought I was going to die. Even if it's true, rolling around for 10 seconds
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:33.800]  on a bed drunkenly, which obviously it's all falling apart. Just the adding, I thought
[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:39.000]  I was going to die. David, this, she looks so coached. And she obviously hasn't been
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:44.920]  coached well. And the way she's stammering these things out, she'll give a statement
[01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:48.040]  that was already in her statement word for word, but then five minutes later, can't
[01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:52.440]  remember it and says the opposite, which shows that when she, she's not good at staying
[01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:57.360]  on script. David, I mean, this is, this will be studied by law schools for, for, for decades
[01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:01.280]  to come as I think some of the most disingenuous testimony in planetary history.
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:06.320]  You know, Alex, it's hard for me to judge because I don't find her credible on the details.
[01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:09.080]  I'm looking at the statement and so forth. I don't know how this is going to play, but
[01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:13.360]  I don't think that people are really going to, they've already made up their mind for
[01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:18.960]  the most part, people on both sides of this. I think even more important than what is going
[01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:24.200]  to happen in this hearing is what came out with Avinati at the last minute. And I think
[01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:29.600]  that is the real issue. When you look at what came out about this 100% credible accuser
[01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:36.040]  that he had, and then what her ex-boyfriend had to do 17 years ago in 2001, he had to
[01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:39.440]  take out a restraining order against her. He said, she was threatening my family, threatening
[01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:43.880]  my wife, threatening to do harm to my baby at the time. And this guy is a registered
[01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:48.760]  Democrat. And how did Avinati respond to that? He said, why are you attacking a sexual assault
[01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:56.120]  victim? It's like, seriously, this was something that was recorded 17 years ago. And so I think
[01:03:56.120 --> 01:04:00.680]  what we're seeing here with Avinati, I think he's done us all a big favor. This guy who
[01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:05.160]  has soaked up all these, all this TV time and everything has put this out there.
[01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:09.680]  Let's go to the specifics of that because it's all just mixing together these women
[01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:15.240]  and then other accusers and then anonymous calls. And then Cabinoles asked about calls
[01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:19.720]  to the switchboard. I mean, somebody called up and say, I saw Cabinoles raping Puff the
[01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:24.560]  magic dragon. And I mean, they're going to call him up and say, did you ever hurt Puff?
[01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:29.600]  I mean, it's insane. Oh yeah. Yeah. I mean, this is a woman who supposedly said these
[01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:35.600]  high school boys had this gang rape series of parties. She was in college when they
[01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:39.560]  were in high school and she went to 10 of these parties. So if any of this is true,
[01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:44.320]  why is she going to parties that high school boys are drugging and raping women and doing
[01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:49.240]  it 10 times? Why didn't she report it? Yeah, exactly. It's absurd on the face of it. Well,
[01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:53.800]  the burden's on them. And then they're not showing any of it. I mean, they lay their
[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:55.600]  hand down. They don't even have any cards.
[01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:03.040]  We all know the importance of fish oils. While we are sure to provide them for ourselves,

[01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:31.800]  You know, this is giving me a headache because you've got four women now, one of them completely
[01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:35.520]  anonymous that called into the switchboard. You've got the news running with it. You've
[01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:45.880]  got the porn lawyer running around, you know, engaged in his bizarre behavior. You've got
[01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:51.160]  Schwetnick and people saying there's restraining orders out on her. And then her lawyer saying,
[01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:57.480]  well, how dare you attack, you know, a sex victim, sex crime victim. And I just can't
[01:06:57.480 --> 01:07:01.560]  keep track of it. And then in every case, when they go talk to the women's witnesses,
[01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:08.660]  they say it's not true. And then it just piles on and piles on and piles on. And then I watched
[01:07:08.660 --> 01:07:12.320]  Ford get cross-examined. And we're going to be playing that coming at the bottom of
[01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:19.440]  the hour. And she just doesn't even know what planet she's on. And none of it matches up
[01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:25.280]  minute to minute. So I'm going to ask you the question. I want to go through the women
[01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:32.520]  one by one here and be specific. Are they thinking of someone else that did this to
[01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:36.360]  them? Are some of them crazy? Are some of them caught up in Trump derangement syndrome?
[01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:40.120]  Are they being coached? Are they lying? All we know is none of it adds up. There's no
[01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:44.920]  witnesses. It's 36 years old. You've got swamp lawyers on each side. And this sets the precedent
[01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:49.480]  of guilty until proven innocent. As the president said, this is incredibly dangerous. And I've
[01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:55.680]  experienced the Democrats manufacture whole cloth lies about me and just outrageous stories.
[01:07:55.680 --> 01:08:01.240]  So they'll sound believable because they're so crazy. So but I want to ask you this question.
[01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:07.120]  Gut level. Do you think Kavanaugh gets confirmed? A, B, if he doesn't, what happens if he does?
[01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:12.120]  What happens? Well, President Trump has said that if he doesn't get the confirmation vote,
[01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:15.960]  which is scheduled to take place tomorrow, that he's going to have a replacement within
[01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:19.000]  an hour. I don't know who that's going to be. I wish, as you had said at the beginning
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:24.880]  of the broadcast, I wish it had been Amy Barrett because I liked her on the issues better.
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:29.600]  She was clerking for Scalia. This guy has been involved with Kennedy, who has been very,
[01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:34.280]  very unreliable, very status. He's connected with all the Republican establishment. So
[01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:38.520]  I'm not a fan of Brett Kavanaugh, but I don't like this process. I don't like what me too
[01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:43.160]  has become where all men are instantly guilty. And they have to try to prove that they're
[01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:46.680]  innocent. We saw this with Roy Moore. And of course, Roy Moore was not part of the GOP
[01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:51.760]  establishment. I've always believed that it was because he went to Capitol Hill after
[01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:55.480]  he won the primary and started talking about how he's going to oppose Mitch McConnell. I
[01:08:55.480 --> 01:08:59.040]  always believe that it came that attack came from Mitch McConnell. And they treat him the
[01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:02.520]  same way they knew they could get away with us. We had that precedent set that you're
[01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:07.160]  guilty and you can't prove that you're innocent. And so I think he's still going to, I think
[01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:11.240]  he'll make the vote, Alex. I think he's still going to make this vote. But when we look
[01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:17.960]  at these charges here, they're not credible. Christine Ford is the, I would say she's,
[01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:22.920]  all the rest of these are just patently absurd in the same way that it was with Roy Moore.
[01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:26.200]  All of the allegations against him. I mean, people were coming up with things. Well, he
[01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:31.240]  asked out a woman who was 18 years old, 10 years younger than him at the time. She was
[01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:34.040]  working in the mall. He asked her out for a date. Can you believe that? And it's like,
[01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:39.080]  what's, what's even wrong with that? There was one, he said, she said that should have
[01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:43.680]  been looked at, but then it comes down to credibility. And that's the situation we've
[01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:49.200]  got here. So that's why they pulled in Christine Ford. All these other people, Ramirez, Avenatti's,
[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:53.600]  last minute, 100% credible witness, Julie Sweatnick, none of these things and these
[01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:57.240]  anonymous charges, that's all going to fall by the wayside. They pile these other things
[01:09:57.240 --> 01:10:04.240]  on to try to give it weight when they've got one, he said, she said, event. And I don't
[01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:07.400]  think that this is going to, certainly not in the court of public opinion. I don't think
[01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:11.120]  that it's going to work, but who knows what's going to happen in the Senate. This is close
[01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:14.120]  to the election. I still think that he gets through.
[01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:18.680]  I agree. If we stick by him, if Trump sticks by him and he's certainly not perfect, I agree,
[01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:22.480]  Barrett, Amy Cohen, Barrett, much, much better. And they're going to have a lot of trouble
[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:28.000]  saying she raped anybody. And, you know, he's got some neocon connections I don't like.
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:34.280]  But obviously they know that he's going to back Trump. And he believes in the separate
[01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:40.000]  equal clauses that he believes in the executive power. And they don't want that now. They
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:43.760]  wanted that when it was Obama or the Clintons. Now, the fact that they've given the president
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:47.360]  quite frankly, all the dictatorial powers over the economy and Trump's using them to
[01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:53.760]  fix things has them in panic mode. And so to be clear here, because earlier, I'm mixing
[01:10:53.760 --> 01:11:00.520]  all these women together and getting upset. It's Swetnik who reportedly has the restraining
[01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:04.400]  order and all the fights. And I want you to get at that specifically because I was conflating
[01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:08.680]  that with Deborah Mirage. She is alleged in a report published by the New Yorker magazine
[01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:12.320]  that Cabinon exposed himself in a drunken dormitory party and showed his penis in her
[01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:15.760]  face, forcing her to touch it while pushing him away. When Mirage was alleged, the assault
[01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:21.120]  occurred during an 83, 84 school year at Yale University where they were both students.
[01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:24.560]  And then they've talked to the witnesses and they've said that they were at no such party
[01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:28.200]  and never saw that. Now, they did talk about somebody falling through a ceiling. It wasn't
[01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:33.600]  Cabinon and a keg party. So that's, that's the big proof. But I was conflating her accidentally
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:38.520]  with Julie Swetnik of Washington, a legend sworn testimony Wednesday that Cabinon was
[01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:43.760]  present at the 80s house party at which she was gang raped in a testimony submitted by
[01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:49.120]  the Senate Judiciary Committee. And then of course, that's by Michael Abinadi, a true
[01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:53.320]  slime bulb. And then now there was a fourth accuser came forward last night. They put
[01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:56.920]  all of the notes and then later this morning, oh, it was an anonymous call. So they've removed
[01:11:56.920 --> 01:12:01.960]  that. I mean, this is getting ridiculous. And police will tell you in any big case,
[01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:05.720]  David, as you know, that when there's a big serial killer on the loose or something happens
[01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:11.440]  or the firebombing of the governor's mansion, that hundreds of crazies came in and said
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:16.160]  they were guilty or hundreds of witnesses came in and said, they saw it for sure what
[01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:22.520]  happened and they did. And so in any big mega case like this, you're going to end up out
[01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:29.040]  of, you know, 100 plus million women, a good third of them, you know, crazy Hillary worshipers
[01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:35.560]  that are going to, even if they got assaulted sometime in their life, they're going to then
[01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:41.080]  remember that it's Brett Cabinon. And that's what's happened. So I want to ask you about
[01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:47.360]  that, but then separately, what about these two men that have come forward and said that
[01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:50.720]  they were in a party, they were drunk and they were falling on beds with women at that
[01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:57.000]  time, younger women, and that they believe that one of the women looked like Dr. Ford.
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:00.520]  I mean, that right there is big news, but that's just swept under the rug.
[01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:05.240]  Well, of course, they're not credible because they're men. And this is what Sheldon White
[01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:09.680]  asked. Sheldon Whitehouse from Rhode Island, he was the one, he's put forward two of these
[01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:14.160]  anonymous claims in the last 24 hours. One of them, the woman, the mother who said, yeah,
[01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:18.680]  my daughter was on a boat in 1985 and so forth. And Brett Cabinon, I said, I was never in
[01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:24.320]  that area. I was never on a boat. I was never on a boat with Mark Judge. And so that's one
[01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:27.480]  anonymous accusation that's been put forth by Sheldon Whitehouse.
[01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:31.160]  Again, let's pull back from there. I forgot about the fifth one they've already withdrawn
[01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:33.880]  because it was totally fraud.
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:38.360]  That's right. There was another anonymous that was put forward also by Sheldon Whitehouse,
[01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:44.840]  that senator from Rhode Island. And this was a guy who had heard that some girl had
[01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:49.280]  been assaulted by Brett Kavanaugh. He did it anonymously. They figured out who this
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:53.760]  guy was. And as soon as his name was released, he said, no, no, no, I take it back. I was
[01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:58.180]  mistaken. This is the nature of this. And two of these anonymous things have been put
[01:13:58.180 --> 01:14:02.160]  through with Sheldon Whitehouse. But when he was questioning Christine Ford, Sheldon
[01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:06.160]  Whitehouse says, well, you know, you've done everything. You've had a lie detector test
[01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:10.760]  as if those things are worthwhile. My wife worked as a personnel manager, district personnel
[01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:14.400]  manager for a convenience store. Whenever there was a problem, they would always do
[01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:18.160]  lie detector tests. They didn't believe any of that stuff. It was not important, except
[01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:22.280]  as an intimidation factor. But nevertheless, you know, we took a lie detector test, you
[01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:27.680]  did this, you did this, and never mentioning the fact that all these witnesses have contradicted
[01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:33.560]  her written and oral testimony and never mentioning these other people on all of this.
[01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:37.120]  But again, it's Sheldon Whitehouse who's putting out all this stuff. And this is the way Alexis
[01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:43.480]  is running in the hearing. They're having this female special counsel that's going through
[01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:47.680]  some of the details, but then never drawing a conclusion, never pointing out, but you
[01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:51.520]  said this and they said that, not doing a good job of putting those things. She questions
[01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:56.160]  her on the details, but she doesn't say, but that contradicts what you said before. She
[01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:59.960]  never says that. Instead, they go to the Democrats and the Democrats lay out all this stuff in
[01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:04.160]  a very emotional way and then have Christine Ford agree with it.
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:08.200]  That's right. And of course, you know, why not just have Peter Strock do the lie detector
[01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:12.720]  test. We're just here, oh, someone from the FBI formerly. And then again, she has the
[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:16.360]  swamp lawyers all around her in there. We're going to go to break. We're going to come
[01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:22.040]  back and play her opening statement part of it and how she thought she was going to die.
[01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:29.560]  And then we're going to get to the former female prosecutor on sex crimes that interviewed
[01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:34.200]  her and the whole thing fell apart from there. And then I'll give you a timeframe when we
[01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:43.000]  come back on when Brett Gabbana is scheduled to testify in full wars.com news wars.com

[01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:31.480]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize
[01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:36.040]  my mother's house. I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating
[01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:40.080]  them ever since. I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people
[01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:44.080]  deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved. I can help you too. If you

[01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:07.640]  Still X2 is the pure iodine. No one else has this from deep earth crystals between 7 and
[01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:13.040]  12,000 feet. It's very hard for me to get. It's the good halogen. But instead they hammer
[01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:18.320]  you with the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, that literally fog you, fill all
[01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:23.840]  your cells, your thyroid, you name it. Myotrysilinium goes with it like a horse of carriage. Silinium
[01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:29.880]  is an electrochemical. It's needed as well in all activity in the body, particularly
[01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:35.960]  neurons. So these go incredibly well together. We have a combo of those. Just experience it
[01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:40.880]  for yourself. Why do you think they fear me so much? Very simple stuff. Fill to your
[01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:46.080]  water. Yeah, I find myself some water filters. Best out there for the price. When I say it's

[01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:34.120]  Like the 300, we politically have to stand our ground. This is the big globalist counter
[01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:42.880]  assault. China is threatening war against the U.S. This is an incredible time to be
[01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:48.600]  alive right now. Start of the next segment, I'm going to give you some incredible censorship
[01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:55.600]  news that is next level. It ties into the hearings yesterday that I should have been
[01:20:55.600 --> 01:21:01.240]  at with Google lying through their teeth saying they don't censor anybody and they're
[01:21:01.240 --> 01:21:09.920]  not working with China. They know nothing about it. You talk about lying to Congress.
[01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:20.480]  The head of global privacy at Google is quite the liar. Just the name. Oh, the head of privacy
[01:21:20.480 --> 01:21:26.640]  when they're all about raping your privacy. Inherently in a satanic attempt at omnipresence.
[01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:31.840]  David Knight's writing shotgun with us. I'm Alex Jones. InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com
[01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:37.640]  are the dreaded enemies of the globalist because we've got their number. Let's go to her part
[01:21:37.640 --> 01:21:43.360]  of her opening statement about thinking she was going to die. This is just unbelievably
[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:48.240]  bad acting in my opinion. She's a public figure. I'm allowed to say that. I don't believe any
[01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:51.960]  of it. Her whole story is falling apart. She has political games. She's a political operative
[01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:56.080]  and on and on and on. Her witnesses, she says she has, say the opposite. She just keeps
[01:21:56.080 --> 01:22:00.320]  bringing the witnesses forward, which is next level lying. Weeks after they're going, that's
[01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:05.560]  not true. That didn't happen. Well, my friend this, my friend that, that is so crucial.
[01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:09.440]  And the other women, it's all falling apart. That's what's amazing. If they had real witnesses
[01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:16.760]  and this stuff came out, I'd say, I told you get, bear it in there. It's a lot better
[01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:21.000]  on the eyes and she's got a better voting record. Boy, I'll take both. So I'm all about
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:26.960]  women. There were patriots in there. I love it. Certainly no glass ceiling in my vision.
[01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:32.400]  I got three daughters, not a virtue second. Oh, I love them, but I'm digressing. Ladies
[01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:39.840]  and gentlemen, the issue here is that this is a travesty. This is a civil war. This is
[01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:43.960]  our country being torn apart. And this is very, very dangerous to get rid of innocent
[01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:48.600]  until proven guilty. And then have the Democrats selectively enforced this and it being led
[01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:54.480]  by famous predators against women, Hillary Rodham Clinton and William Jefferson Clinton.
[01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:57.880]  But let's go ahead and just start getting to her. I just, at a Pavlovian level, I have
[01:22:57.880 --> 01:23:01.680]  a visceral bad response to her, just like Hillary. So I've trouble looking at her, but I'm going
[01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:06.720]  to look down. You don't look the gorgon directly in the eyes. So here is Ford in her opening
[01:23:06.720 --> 01:23:14.440]  statement. There was music playing in the bedroom. It was turned up louder by either
[01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:20.280]  Brett or Mark once we were in the room. I was pushed onto the bed and Brett got on
[01:23:20.280 --> 01:23:29.840]  top of me. He began running his hands over my body and grinding into me. I yelled, hoping
[01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:34.960]  that someone downstairs might hear me. And I tried to get away from him, but his weight
[01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:42.200]  was heavy. Brett groped me and tried to take off my clothes. He had a hard time because
[01:23:42.200 --> 01:23:47.960]  he was very inebriated. And because I was wearing a one-piece bathing suit underneath
[01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:57.160]  my clothing. I believed he was going to rape me. I tried to yell for help. When I did,
[01:23:57.160 --> 01:24:02.720]  Brett put his hand over my mouth to stop me from yelling. This is what terrified me the
[01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:09.120]  most and has had the most lasting impact on my life. It was hard for me to breathe. And
[01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:12.800]  I thought that Brett was accidentally going to kill me.
[01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:17.560]  There's this other clip we'll try to find. I saw it live this morning where she goes,
[01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:23.320]  I saw the doors at Google and they were misshaped. And then I remembered and I'm like, is this
[01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:29.280]  through the looking glass? Like MK Ultra Mind Control or something? I mean, this is, some
[01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:33.680]  of this stuff is so weird. We'll get David Knight's take on this. But let's play now
[01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:42.960]  this other bizarre clip about Google interns living at her house and PTSD. I mean, there's
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:45.760]  just hours of this. Here it is.
[01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:50.760]  Can you tell us what impact the events had on you?
[01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:58.880]  Well, I think that the sequelae of sexual assault varies by person. So for me personally,
[01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:05.000]  anxiety, phobia and PTSD like symptoms are the types of things that I've been coping
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:11.720]  with. So more specifically, claustrophobia, panic, and that type of thing.
[01:25:11.720 --> 01:25:16.480]  Is that the reason for the second door front door is claustrophobia?
[01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:22.880]  Correct. It doesn't, our house does not look aesthetically pleasing from the curb.
[01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:25.120]  I see. And do you have that second front door?
[01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:30.920]  Yes. And it now is a place to host Google interns because we live near Google. So we
[01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:34.360]  get to, and other students can look.
[01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:40.840]  Can you tell us, is there any other way this has affected your life?
[01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:49.680]  The primary impact was in the initial four years after the event. I struggled academically.
[01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:55.560]  I struggled very much in Chapel Hill and in college.
[01:25:55.560 --> 01:26:02.560]  And she's sitting there with the deep state top lawyer for McCabe and Comey and all of
[01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:07.200]  them. I mean, I just can't, they're just relishing. And when she talks to women are all looking
[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:10.920]  at her and shaking their heads like, Oh, you poor baby. Oh my God, you've been through
[01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:15.800]  so much and they're just relishing this. And then she sycophantically smiles and like looks
[01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:20.200]  up and it finds time. Like, am I pleasing you?
[01:26:20.200 --> 01:26:25.840]  And it's just all this victimology. That's what everyone is into. This is how you destroy
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:32.480]  a country right here. Meanwhile, China executes you if you're gay. Or if you bitch and complain,
[01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:37.920]  they kill you. There's no welfare. You do what you're told. Daycare is chaining your
[01:26:37.920 --> 01:26:42.640]  kids up a power pole for most people. That's what we're competing against. And this is
[01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:47.020]  the psychological warfare we've got. We're at birth now. They're going to take your
[01:26:47.020 --> 01:26:53.640]  kids away if you don't start putting them on drugs to change their quote sex.
[01:26:53.640 --> 01:27:02.040]  So David, this is just unspeakably bizarre. I mean, I think really bizarre is the, the,
[01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:09.320]  the, the, the special stench of this is just how bizarre and weird and twisted it is. And
[01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:15.920]  then if we just keep going down this road, if they are able to destroy Kavanaugh in
[01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:21.080]  this fashion, it sets a precedent to open Pandora's box wide open. What do you think
[01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:22.840]  will happen if they don't confirm him?
[01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:27.440]  Well, you know, Alex, I think that they learned their lesson. They learned a lesson anyway
[01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:32.560]  from the Clarence Thomas and Edith Hill situation. I think they realized that if they've got
[01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:37.520]  a, he said, she said situation, they're not going to win. And so what we saw with both
[01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:42.800]  Roy Moore and with this Brett Kavanaugh situation, you have somebody come forward as he said,
[01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:49.440]  she said situation, and then they bring up this swarm of incredulous allegations from
[01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:53.320]  other people to try to give that credibility says they don't have any evidence for that
[01:27:53.320 --> 01:27:57.480]  to try to move forward their political agenda. So that's one aspect of it. You talked about
[01:27:57.480 --> 01:28:04.480]  the Soros lawyer and there is an interesting lawyer connection between Avenatti's accuser
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:11.440]  Julie Swetnick and Christine Ford. And that is Deborah Katz. You know, when I cover this
[01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:16.720]  every time I bring it in, I come in with Tom Jones is what's new pussy cats? Well, these
[01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:21.720]  people, they wear, she wears the pussy hat in the Women's March and I think, but she's
[01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:26.680]  also got Deborah Katz and these people are the the cats women here. Just like Gloria
[01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:30.560]  Alred, she's an ambulance chaser with the Me Too stuff, but she represented her 10 years
[01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:35.040]  ago in a sexual harassment lawsuit for the Wall Street Journal. She represented the
[01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:42.040]  Avenatti's person and she is the lawyer for Christine Ford and in addition to the Soros
[01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:47.200]  law. It's a gaggle of new status and the same lawyer Katz covered up for Hillary, covered
[01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:53.080]  up for Bill, all of this. I mean, these people are just a pack of slime balls and they're
[01:28:53.080 --> 01:28:58.520]  all really ugly too. You ever noticed that?
[01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:05.240]  Let's talk tough. Let's talk comfort. Let's talk about down home value made in the USA
[01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:13.920]  blue jeans like you wore as a kid. Remember, there's a place down in Tennessee where they
[01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:23.640]  make blue diamond gusset jeans. They so pride in every stitch guarantee you love the way

[01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:36.680]  It's a Spartan copy of a famous sculpture dug up in Greece from the days of 300.
[01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:40.680]  And that's what this really comes down to, ladies and gentlemen, is we have to stand
[01:33:40.680 --> 01:33:44.680]  against the globalists in their lives. This is an information war. This is important as
[01:33:44.680 --> 01:33:47.680]  any other war we've ever fought in this country. And those of us that just get to fight the
[01:33:47.680 --> 01:33:54.680]  information war are a lot more blessed than people who had to charge up hills like what
[01:33:54.680 --> 01:34:01.680]  you saw in Iwo Jima. David and I tried to shotgun with me doing a great job. I intend
[01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:08.680]  to open the phones up here in the next segment. She's coming back to testify more. Kavanaugh
[01:34:08.680 --> 01:34:12.680]  is coming up later. We'll obviously cover it live, gavel to gavel when he speaks with
[01:34:12.680 --> 01:34:17.680]  his statement. You learn about credibility watching and listening to people. You also
[01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:22.680]  learn about histories with people. And the fact is, if somebody was a hellraiser, you'd
[01:34:22.680 --> 01:34:28.680]  hear about it and there'd be witnesses to it. And the truth is, everybody says this
[01:34:28.680 --> 01:34:33.680]  guy was a complete nerd and a virgin until the word is until he got out of college.
[01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:36.680]  And then that becomes a little embarrassing for him. I don't think it's embarrassing. I
[01:34:36.680 --> 01:34:41.680]  wish that I would not have gotten dropped in the middle of extreme promiscuity. I never
[01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:46.680]  forced sex on anybody. In fact, I, contrary to that, women would call it sexual assaults
[01:34:46.680 --> 01:34:51.680]  today. The things women have done to me, jump on top of you, grab you, throw you on the
[01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:54.680]  bed. I mean, I think that's when a guy thinks he's got lucky. I mean, when a woman wants
[01:34:54.680 --> 01:34:58.680]  you, she jumps on top of you. Everybody knows that. That's what Trump was talking about when
[01:34:58.680 --> 01:35:01.680]  women would jump on. I mean, just do whatever you want. It's crazy. They just jump on you.
[01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:08.680]  It's like Elvis Presley. But with Kavanaugh, that's not what's going on here. Okay. And
[01:35:08.680 --> 01:35:16.680]  you know, my son is athletic and a bookworm and stuff, but you know, he is very conservative
[01:35:16.680 --> 01:35:20.680]  and I'm actually proud of that. And I'm not like, Hey, get out there and date a bunch
[01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:25.680]  of girls because I know how painful it can be. You know, relationships are serious, serious
[01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:29.680]  things. So I think it's good to shelter our children, especially in this day and age,
[01:35:29.680 --> 01:35:33.680]  because things are just out of control. Now we do have a bunch of clips of the cross
[01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:39.680]  examination by the Rachel Mitchell, former prosecutor, current prosecutor of sex crimes
[01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:45.680]  who does literally annihilate her. Ford, we're going to get to that, but I've got some really
[01:35:45.680 --> 01:35:54.680]  serious news. Here's what's happening. David Knight had at libertarian when Twitter first
[01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:59.680]  started and he had a huge following of hundreds and hundreds of thousands on Twitter. David,
[01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:06.680]  obviously on iTunes had, depending on which iTunes subscription you looked at, we had
[01:36:06.680 --> 01:36:11.680]  like 19 million subscribers and he had close to 10 million. What was really important was
[01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:16.680]  he had a higher opening rate and listening rate than I did. Now did I get upset by that?
[01:36:16.680 --> 01:36:20.680]  Now I'm like, thank God, you know, this is wonderful. We're going to save the country.
[01:36:20.680 --> 01:36:26.680]  We deleted everybody that wanted to subscribe to him. A very gentlemanly guy, almost the
[01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:31.680]  opposite style of me, and that's good. We compliment each other. Think about that, that when they
[01:36:31.680 --> 01:36:37.680]  purged, they purged hundreds of other channels that just had Alex Jones in the name. There
[01:36:37.680 --> 01:36:41.680]  was a war, over 20 apps that were in full wars for Alex Jones that fans had made over
[01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:45.680]  the years. Some had millions of downloads that were free. They got rid of those. It's
[01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:50.680]  like taking Winnie the Pooh out of computers in China where you can't say Pooh, you can't
[01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:55.680]  send the image Pooh, you can't send a Taiwanese flag in China. Apple suddenly started doing
[01:36:55.680 --> 01:37:00.680]  that worldwide a few months ago. This is the annihilation of language and you can only do
[01:37:00.680 --> 01:37:05.680]  it with these omnipresent computer systems that are waging war on language itself. And
[01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:14.680]  so you see the end of innocent until proven guilty here where they say Alex Jones is banned
[01:37:14.680 --> 01:37:19.680]  because he was mean to transgenders and he bullied a child. I showed an ABC News clip
[01:37:19.680 --> 01:37:24.680]  of a kid punching an adult four times. He pushes the kid down. They said on the news,
[01:37:24.680 --> 01:37:29.680]  I did that. I was banned for something I didn't do. And notice they'll never say what it was,
[01:37:29.680 --> 01:37:32.680]  but we know what the video was. It was the guy pushing the kid down because that's what
[01:37:32.680 --> 01:37:37.680]  banned us. Now the latest thing is we go look, they're starting in Europe to drug children
[01:37:37.680 --> 01:37:43.680]  in age three to change their sexuality saying the child chose it. No, a cult of evil manipulated
[01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:48.680]  them into it. So David got the word and got the letter that he's been given a seven day
[01:37:48.680 --> 01:37:54.680]  suspension for saying cranny because Twitter had a vote in 2017 decided that word is now
[01:37:54.680 --> 01:38:02.680]  hateful and they can just change it to whatever name they want the next day. Show. We have
[01:38:02.680 --> 01:38:09.680]  a major fan account and they contact us and the fans, you know, let us use the Twitter
[01:38:09.680 --> 01:38:13.680]  when we want. We're so busy and the accounts not that big. We don't really use it very
[01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:18.680]  much, but we have access to it. So they said, Hey, look, almost all of our accounts,
[01:38:18.680 --> 01:38:21.680]  including David Knights, and that's his own account. He had many years for even worked
[01:38:21.680 --> 01:38:27.680]  at info wars. They've all been either banned or given seven day suspensions, but what six
[01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:31.680]  accounts in the last 24 hours. And I've got the article and the documents right here.
[01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:37.680]  Document cam shot, please. This is from Twitter. And this is info wars news at prison
[01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:43.680]  planet TV couple hundred thousand subscribers. We've temporarily limited some of your account
[01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:49.680]  features. What happened? Violating our rules against hateful conduct. And that's any definition
[01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:53.680]  subjectively they want. You may not promote violence against threatened or harass other
[01:38:53.680 --> 01:38:59.680]  people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender
[01:38:59.680 --> 01:39:09.680]  identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease. Now, this is the
[01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:13.680]  offending tweet. Now get ready for this. If you're ready, a listener TV viewers already
[01:39:13.680 --> 01:39:19.680]  have your mouth saying open. This is what the fans sent out that was a copy of one of
[01:39:19.680 --> 01:39:25.680]  our official Twitter pages. Alex Jones opens the phone lines to answer the question. Will
[01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:32.680]  President Trump stand up to the Obama administration holdovers mutiny and end the deep states reign
[01:39:32.680 --> 01:39:38.680]  of terror over the United States? Obama's a public figure. Obama did put stay behind
[01:39:38.680 --> 01:39:46.680]  groups that say they want to kill the president. This is true. There's nothing about Obama
[01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:54.680]  being part African. There's nothing about any of that. We are saying in the tweet. Will
[01:39:54.680 --> 01:39:59.680]  Trump take action? And this is the thing they get mad about. When I called for Trump to
[01:39:59.680 --> 01:40:04.680]  take action, they gave me a seven day suspension before they totally banned me saying I called
[01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:08.680]  for battle rifles to assault people. Never said it on there. They just lied. But I was
[01:40:08.680 --> 01:40:13.680]  calling for Trump to take action. Well, don't worry. You guys elevated us even more now
[01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:17.680]  to out whatever I wanted to the president just absolutely within hours goes to him.
[01:40:17.680 --> 01:40:21.680]  So if you were trying to keep from having hearings about Google, working with China to round
[01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:25.680]  up people or Apple, it's all over the place. You got grilled yesterday, Google by Ted Cruz.
[01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:33.680]  It's the beginning of the end. Okay. So guess what? I politically already suicide bombs
[01:40:33.680 --> 01:40:37.680]  your butt. No, no, Joseph running a suicide bomb. No, it's a metaphor that yeah, you blown
[01:40:37.680 --> 01:40:45.680]  me up to a certain extent. I blew you up politically. But read this and this is next level. Total
[01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:52.680]  truth. And when I said we are in a rain of terror of racism and sexism and demoralizing
[01:40:52.680 --> 01:40:56.680]  people and brainwashing our kids and just all this horrible stuff they rain down on
[01:40:56.680 --> 01:41:02.680]  us. And I'm saying how long will this rain of terror go on? It's well written. It's
[01:41:02.680 --> 01:41:09.680]  eloquent. It's the truth. It's a headline that I wrote that day for the website that
[01:41:09.680 --> 01:41:14.680]  somebody else copied and tweeted out and they said this is not allowed. We say this is
[01:41:14.680 --> 01:41:20.680]  terrible. This is pure Americana. Meanwhile, World Star Hip Hop, where they celebrate
[01:41:20.680 --> 01:41:26.680]  knockout games and killing white people beyond any, imagine a KKK site where it's white
[01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:30.680]  people killing black people. It's horrible issue. And look, they have their free speech.
[01:41:30.680 --> 01:41:35.680]  People killing folks are getting arrested, but it's snuff films. Live leak, World Star
[01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:40.680]  Hip Hop, PayPal all work together. It's all great. It's all wonderful. The Antifa site
[01:41:40.680 --> 01:41:46.680]  saying kill Ted Cruz, kill his family, kill the restaurant owners, kill Mike Pence. It's
[01:41:46.680 --> 01:41:52.680]  all up. It's operating. They've got PayPal to sell their Antifa shirts, but not me.
[01:41:52.680 --> 01:41:59.680]  They made the moral decision that I'm banned. Think about that. It's a calamity brain article.
[01:41:59.680 --> 01:42:05.680]  And the real headline should be PayPal works with snuff film site, World Star Hip Hop.
[01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:11.680]  I mean, you go to World Star Hip Hop folks. There's hundreds of videos of old white homeless
[01:42:11.680 --> 01:42:18.680]  people having their brains beaten out and pools of blood being shot, being stabbed, being
[01:42:18.680 --> 01:42:25.680]  punched, falling over, dying. And then other videos, horrible racist black people and their
[01:42:25.680 --> 01:42:30.680]  white acolytes celebrating it. So we're going to come back and talk about this with David
[01:42:30.680 --> 01:42:35.680]  Knight and then get to the prosecutor asking her a few real questions, but not pointing
[01:42:35.680 --> 01:42:39.680]  out, not going back and pointing out, well, hey, why are you changing your story? But
[01:42:39.680 --> 01:42:45.680]  that's coming up. But there you go. Snuff film site, World Star Hip Hop has PayPal, but not
[01:42:45.680 --> 01:42:52.680]  me. Again, this is the slander, the defamation. I'm a racist for sharing Obama is trying to
[01:42:52.680 --> 01:42:56.680]  overthrow Trump. That's now racist and we've been blocked by Twitter.
