[00:00.000 --> 00:18.520]  you are listening to an info wars dot com frontline report if you are receiving this
[00:18.520 --> 00:37.120]  transmission you are the resistance oh we are riding on a storm for real it's
[00:37.120 --> 00:46.600]  already Tuesday December 4th 2000 and 18 I'm your host Alex Jones and this is the
[00:46.600 --> 00:53.680]  most demonized most attacked the most lied about broadcast in the world because
[00:53.680 --> 00:59.320]  we know what we're talking about again thank you so much for joining us
[00:59.320 --> 01:06.400]  censorship is back in the news big time because President Trump just got tricked
[01:06.400 --> 01:14.280]  into signing the so-called new NAFTA GATT deal the USMCA that is a better deal
[01:14.280 --> 01:18.800]  than the previous one we had he's been getting some good negotiations out of a
[01:18.800 --> 01:25.240]  lot of countries and a lot of these unelected systems but clearly within
[01:25.240 --> 01:32.640]  this multi hundred page framework that's not ratified yet it says that big tech
[01:32.640 --> 01:36.120]  consensus or whoever they want whenever they want but still have liability
[01:36.120 --> 01:47.760]  protection and not be a publisher so it's all coming up today on that front on
[01:47.760 --> 01:53.840]  that subject Breitbart has an excellent report on it we have it linked up on
[01:53.840 --> 02:03.400]  info wars dot com USMCA entrenched tech companies right to censor and transfers
[02:03.400 --> 02:07.560]  it into an international agreement so it's bad on that front as well
[02:07.560 --> 02:13.960]  meanwhile the ADL has given Tim Cook the head of the largest corporation in
[02:13.960 --> 02:19.720]  the world that owns the most abusive slave factories on the planet that they
[02:19.720 --> 02:25.880]  contract with them who has the most overpriced garbage in fact it's well
[02:25.880 --> 02:29.480]  known that Amazon and other big retailers when they know you're using an
[02:29.480 --> 02:35.360]  Apple device they automatically charge you more hotel tickets plane tickets
[02:35.360 --> 02:42.800]  tickets to the show tickets to Broadway whatever you're buying anything off an
[02:42.800 --> 02:47.600]  Apple device big tech says we've got a schmuck we've got a schmuck we've got a
[02:47.600 --> 02:53.200]  schmuck by the way I'm a schmuck because PCs weren't as good 20 years ago at
[02:53.200 --> 02:59.640]  video editing I went from PC to Mac adopted it and it's got some benefits
[02:59.640 --> 03:04.000]  being a closed system but it's tailor-made for evil tailor-made for
[03:04.000 --> 03:09.600]  oppression it's merged with China officially Tim Cook has done that I
[03:09.600 --> 03:13.760]  memorialize that the special report I did meet Tim Cook the most dangerous man
[03:13.760 --> 03:21.400]  in the world well he has now gone before the ADL and said that it's a sin not to
[03:21.400 --> 03:30.120]  ban me it's a sin and the ADL themselves named he who will not be named at the
[03:30.120 --> 03:32.800]  event but he did not name me but they were all talking about me the press
[03:32.800 --> 03:38.440]  points that out he was given an award for censorship how draconian how
[03:38.440 --> 03:43.160]  authoritarian we're gonna play that video coming up and then we'll look at
[03:43.160 --> 03:48.560]  all the days censorship felt like 10 articles without even looking here where
[03:48.560 --> 03:53.960]  Stanford saying take down the American flag it's offensive vegans want to ban
[03:53.960 --> 04:00.240]  the phrase bring home the bacon BBC's moves to ban 10 Christmas songs putting

[04:06.800 --> 04:11.680]  Cook the most dangerous man in the world we're gonna be looking at all of that in
[04:11.680 --> 04:16.520]  the big celebration of the big corporations and others about how the
[04:16.520 --> 04:19.640]  Republican establishment has been asleep at the switch and allowed the
[04:19.640 --> 04:25.440]  draconian censorship to not just take root but to flower and now it's
[04:25.440 --> 04:30.680]  exploding worse and worse and worse and worse by the moment and they're moving
[04:30.680 --> 04:36.200]  in to just saying we're now going to arrest you if you criticize Islam or if
[04:36.200 --> 04:41.920]  you catch the school the preschool putting your son in a dress and telling

[06:33.360 --> 06:54.960]  I understand you was tapped for skull and bones tapped for it sir he founded skull
[06:54.960 --> 07:01.760]  and bones we have before us the opportunity to forge for ourselves and
[07:01.760 --> 07:08.360]  for future generations a new world order a world where the rule of law not the law
[07:08.360 --> 07:13.160]  of the jungle governs the conductive nations now we can see a new world
[07:13.160 --> 07:19.360]  coming into view a world in which there is the very real prospect of a new world
[07:19.360 --> 07:25.760]  order a new world order can emerge if it is a sometimes very independent
[07:25.760 --> 07:35.760]  organization despite evidence that Noriega was involved in drug trafficking Bush kept Noriega on the payroll the United States tonight declared in effect of Panama's
[07:35.760 --> 07:40.760]  general Manuel Noriega is a threat to this country's national security Mr. Noriega
[07:40.760 --> 07:48.560]  the drug indicted drug related indicted dictator of Panama we want to bring him to
[07:48.560 --> 07:55.080]  justice we want to get him out and we want to restore democracy to Panama and
[07:55.080 --> 08:00.520]  so when you read these outrageous charges by a drug related indicted
[08:00.520 --> 08:06.800]  dictator discount them they are total lies men who are working for the C.A.'s army
[08:06.800 --> 08:11.160]  were responsible for bringing all that cocaine in Los Angeles that sparked the
[08:11.160 --> 08:14.960]  crack epidemic my boss goes on a fishing trip with George Bush and when they come
[08:14.960 --> 08:18.760]  back they say the ends justify the means
[08:18.760 --> 08:31.760]  of the Republicans are trying to blame you for the existence of a small air base at Mena, Arkansas this base was set up by George Bush and Oliver North and the CIA to help the Iran
[08:31.760 --> 08:44.440]  Contras and they brought in plain load after plain load of cocaine there the sale in the United States and then they took the money and bought weapons and took them back to the Contras all of which was illegal as you know under the
[08:44.440 --> 08:49.520]  lower back but tell me did they tell you that this had to be in existence because of
[08:49.520 --> 08:55.320]  national security we had nothing zero to do with it and everybody who's ever
[08:55.320 --> 09:00.400]  looked into it knows that on the morning of August 2nd thousands of people in
[09:00.400 --> 09:05.200]  Kuwait city woke up to war day away from the window thousands of troops had
[09:05.200 --> 09:10.120]  swarmed into the capital they took the babies out of incubators took incubators
[09:10.120 --> 09:14.560]  and let the children to die on the coast far they had kids in incubators and they
[09:14.560 --> 09:20.040]  were thrown out of the incubators so the Kuwait could be systematically dismantled
[09:20.040 --> 09:25.200]  five months ago Saddam Hussein started this cruel war against Kuwait tonight
[09:25.200 --> 09:31.960]  the battle has been joined may all the Democrats forgive me this close to the
[09:31.960 --> 09:40.240]  election I love George Bush he thinks of George a little bit like the father he
[09:40.240 --> 09:47.040]  didn't have he's very loving to him and I really appreciate that I love Bill Clinton
[09:47.040 --> 09:52.480]  I love my dad I'd kill for him I'd go to prison for him because I loved him so
[09:52.480 --> 09:55.280]  much you've often referred to Bill Clinton and you talked about his
[09:55.280 --> 09:59.280]  relationship with your father and how it developed in your mother as well and
[09:59.280 --> 10:04.040]  he's your brother from another mother what does that make Hillary Clinton to
[10:04.040 --> 10:10.080]  the Bush family my sister-in-law interesting
[10:13.480 --> 10:20.160]  waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front
[10:20.160 --> 10:35.680]  lines of the info war that's just a little sampling of the real George H. W.
[10:35.680 --> 10:44.280]  Scullin bones Bush the man that said the NRA should be abolished the man that
[10:44.280 --> 10:48.640]  wanted open borders the man that said America as a country shouldn't be allowed
[10:48.640 --> 10:54.160]  to exist he was a Rockefeller Republican well everybody else is face
[10:54.160 --> 10:58.840]  down worshiping him we're not gonna be doing that here at info wars we're gonna
[10:58.840 --> 11:06.520]  tell the truth let the chips fall where they may there's a bunch of articles out
[11:06.520 --> 11:11.080]  the day where all over the country colleges are saying don't fly the
[11:11.080 --> 11:15.360]  American flight you know the night circuit what was it six years ago and
[11:15.360 --> 11:20.960]  then again three years ago ruled twice that American flags are offensive and
[11:20.960 --> 11:27.760]  should not be displayed in public at colleges or at high schools and I've
[11:27.760 --> 11:31.480]  got articles here today where they're telling fraternities don't fly the
[11:31.480 --> 11:37.680]  American flag it's offensive remember Obama wouldn't let Navy seals or the
[11:37.680 --> 11:43.920]  Navy fly the Gadsden flag which is the coiled snake don't tread on me it's a
[11:43.920 --> 11:50.800]  flag used by the militia then adopt is one of the first flags by the founder of
[11:50.800 --> 11:59.760]  the US Navy John Paul Jones the National Archives they have 250 255 year old
[11:59.760 --> 12:03.920]  gas and flags but you can't have it it's offensive just like when Trump said
[12:03.920 --> 12:11.800]  we're a nation we exist we pay taxes we have our sovereignty we're a country and
[12:11.800 --> 12:17.080]  the media was like we can't believe oh they all had feigned moments of not
[12:17.080 --> 12:22.960]  being able to speak did you just hear that what what did he molest a child no
[12:22.960 --> 12:30.200]  did he ship in narcotics in the country no that's Bill Clinton no he said the
[12:30.200 --> 12:38.000]  the country exist what hatred what violence what evil that's what the
[12:38.000 --> 12:41.800]  UN says if a country exist that lets other countries exist and they could
[12:41.800 --> 12:46.400]  fight and so we could have violence so nations existing causes violence even
[12:46.400 --> 12:50.080]  though it's the UN engineering global conflict and violence to bring in their
[12:50.080 --> 12:55.480]  one-world government you know it's the UN that oversaw all the Arab Springs and
[12:55.480 --> 13:02.600]  Gulf War one and Gulf War two to destabilize the planet and now at
[13:02.600 --> 13:07.400]  hindsight we know what those wars were all about some of us knew at the time
[13:07.400 --> 13:14.840]  but I don't blame the soldiers I don't blame the people that follow the
[13:14.840 --> 13:19.240]  orders and who believe the propaganda I blame those in the establishment that
[13:19.240 --> 13:34.800]  knew what they were doing and now we have the anti-defamation league set up in
[13:34.800 --> 13:47.960]  1913 after a member of the Jewish mafia got caught committing a crime and so the
[13:47.960 --> 13:52.520]  ADL was set up to basically go after anybody that ever exposed any criminal
[13:52.520 --> 13:58.200]  activity by Jews in this country and now you hear the ADL I mean if Benjamin
[13:58.200 --> 14:03.960]  Netanyahu says Israel has a right to exist that's anti-semitic if Facebook
[14:03.960 --> 14:08.960]  doesn't let George Soros take over they're anti-semitic when George Soros
[14:08.960 --> 14:14.160]  actually worked for the Nazis so the ADL is a criminal anti-American
[14:14.160 --> 14:19.520]  organization that trains our police nationwide in brainwashing but the
[14:19.520 --> 14:24.120]  police don't buy it anywhere and they got caught and they've lost big lawsuits
[14:24.120 --> 14:28.080]  and they've been caught breaking into police departments to get databases on
[14:28.080 --> 14:34.520]  right-wing citizens and where they live the ADL is a parasitic organization
[14:34.520 --> 14:40.120]  that feeds off Jews and other people and their their support of George Soros
[14:40.120 --> 14:47.520]  and Arnold Schwarzenegger shows that shows that in triplicate because
[14:47.520 --> 14:52.480]  Schwarzenegger is a devout Nazi on record admits that he admires Hitler
[14:52.480 --> 14:57.840]  Soros is a Nazi collaborator and then who wants to overthrow Israel and so
[14:57.840 --> 15:03.920]  then if people are critical whether it be Zuckerberg or whether it be Netanyahu
[15:03.920 --> 15:08.640]  then they're the anti-semitic people it's a sick joke so the ADL has not had
[15:08.640 --> 15:13.800]  credibility ever but now it really is a sick sick joke they gave Tim Cook of
[15:13.800 --> 15:19.040]  Apple the biggest corporation in the world that leases and runs the worst
[15:19.040 --> 15:25.200]  hands down even Bloomberg reports this the worst slave factories on earth
[15:25.200 --> 15:28.560]  where if someone criticizes the working additions they're just taken away and
[15:28.560 --> 15:36.600]  killed he was given an award yesterday for censoring yours truly and got up
[15:36.600 --> 15:41.040]  there and bragged about it and then said because I'm calling for violence when
[15:41.040 --> 15:46.240]  Tim Cook has praised China's censorship of Christians and Falun Gong Buddhists
[15:46.240 --> 15:51.000]  and others and he said there should be more and and Han showed the takedown of
[15:51.000 --> 15:56.480]  free speech in America it's all coming up ladies and gentlemen by the way
[15:56.480 --> 16:00.040]  Trump's been tricked into something we got a warning offer now valid in all

[18:10.560 --> 18:15.760]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways eye comfort and
[18:15.760 --> 18:20.960]  respiratory function in the 1960s researchers in France notice that
[18:20.960 --> 18:24.840]  people who ate certain quail eggs experience less seasonal immune and
[18:24.840 --> 18:29.280]  inflammatory responses they began studying this effect in published trials
[18:29.280 --> 18:34.400]  and decades later we now have the fruit of this research a fast-acting chewable

[20:02.400 --> 20:07.800]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[20:07.800 --> 20:28.160]  Waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[20:38.120 --> 20:48.800]  well it turns out there was a massive breach of the RNC's emails but you know
[20:48.800 --> 20:52.680]  the Democrats really couldn't find anything there's no Alistair Crowley
[20:52.680 --> 20:59.320]  spirit cooking events going on there's no discussions about a ship kidnap kids
[20:59.320 --> 21:03.880]  out of Haiti into New York there's no discussions of Jeffrey Epstein and his
[21:03.880 --> 21:09.040]  slave island a little girls there's no discussions of how to cause race war
[21:09.040 --> 21:15.720]  there's no discussions of how to rig the election or rig the polls or even worse
[21:15.720 --> 21:22.000]  rig the debates with CNN which is all in the WikiLeaks no there's just nothing
[21:22.000 --> 21:29.000]  there we're gonna be getting into that but you know we forget when they change
[21:29.000 --> 21:38.440]  the subject over to who hacked or stole or downloaded the emails we forget that
[21:38.440 --> 21:44.120]  they change the subject to who did that instead of what is in these incredible
[21:44.120 --> 21:52.800]  hundreds of thousands of documents and what's in the other 35,000 emails that
[21:52.800 --> 21:59.040]  have disappeared off the face of the earth and then the latest in saying this
[21:59.040 --> 22:04.680]  Trump tweets yesterday while he was still down in South America that Roger
[22:04.680 --> 22:09.920]  Stone has said he won't lie has said that Trump never did anything wrong in
[22:09.920 --> 22:14.640]  response to course he's saying he's been told the liar he'll go to prison by the
[22:14.640 --> 22:20.880]  Mueller witch hunt inquisition and then all these thousands of articles thousands
[22:20.880 --> 22:25.440]  everywhere Trump just engaged in witness tampering that's right if someone
[22:25.440 --> 22:29.040]  says Trump didn't do anything wrong I'll never lie about him and that person's a
[22:29.040 --> 22:33.200]  public figure and hasn't been a witness or even questioned yet and Trump says
[22:33.200 --> 22:37.720]  wow you've got a lot of courage unlike a lot of people the president's free
[22:37.720 --> 22:42.960]  speech is now witness tampering and they had nine liberal professors quoted in
[22:42.960 --> 22:51.840]  one article about how evil he is that's right you can have every channel out
[22:51.840 --> 22:56.120]  there get all the Democrat hacks people involved actually with Russia on TV
[22:56.120 --> 22:59.560]  calling for everybody to be arrested that's Republican calling us all Russian
[22:59.560 --> 23:04.960]  agents with no evidence but if we say you're full of baloney you're full of
[23:04.960 --> 23:13.320]  prunes and Mueller is clearly running around trying to find people who didn't
[23:13.320 --> 23:18.360]  pay taxes or didn't carry their trash out on the right day or whatever so that
[23:18.360 --> 23:22.160]  they can then indict them on stuff that has nothing to do with Russia and then
[23:22.160 --> 23:29.000]  offer them no time in prison if they'll just say Trump wears black fur caps and
[23:29.000 --> 23:35.480]  gets under the table and is a you know what holster for Putin because you know
[23:35.480 --> 23:42.880]  Colbert said that he said that Trump is a cock holster for Vladimir Putin that
[23:42.880 --> 23:49.560]  is the type of total disinformation and lies we see spewing out and then we saw
[23:49.560 --> 23:58.080]  the incredible election meddling of 2016 by the Democrats the censorship the
[23:58.080 --> 24:02.800]  manipulation and then accelerated the last two years publicly and then Trump
[24:02.800 --> 24:08.200]  has spoken out against it but so far done nothing and I was talking to a
[24:08.200 --> 24:11.800]  national talk show host this morning
[24:12.640 --> 24:17.120]  will go unnamed and I said are you on this and he said absolutely we're on it
[24:17.120 --> 24:24.480]  we'll be covering it tonight US MCA in trenches tech companies right to censor
[24:24.480 --> 24:28.880]  and transfers that power to an international body so it's doubly
[24:28.880 --> 24:32.560]  bad it hasn't been ratified and this is a better trade deal overall it's on a
[24:32.560 --> 24:37.120]  one-sided trade deal for America doesn't screw us over when it comes to trade but
[24:37.120 --> 24:39.720]  it has a bunch of stuff in it that isn't dealing with trade is dealing with
[24:39.720 --> 24:46.000]  speech the articles up on info wars.com it's excellent article from bright bar
[24:46.000 --> 24:51.360]  calm president Trump hailed the trade agreement he signed with Mexico and
[24:51.360 --> 24:56.080]  Canada last week as great for all our countries perhaps he doesn't know that
[24:56.080 --> 25:01.080]  the NAFTA replacing trade agreement US MCA gives tech giants in Silicon Valley
[25:01.080 --> 25:06.440]  special legal privilege to censor his own supporters and anyone else they find
[25:06.440 --> 25:09.640]  objectionable and I'm going to cover this with Roger Stone in the next segment
[25:09.640 --> 25:14.920]  because this is everything the way the internet works where you can have a
[25:14.920 --> 25:20.200]  comment section the way you can have a social media system is that you don't
[25:20.200 --> 25:25.120]  have liability for what a third-party post because you are seen as a forum not
[25:25.120 --> 25:29.400]  a publisher well they have that same section here with the liability
[25:29.400 --> 25:35.000]  protection the immunity but then they can also act as a publisher controlling
[25:35.000 --> 25:39.200]  what is published which normally would get rid of your immunity but this
[25:39.200 --> 25:43.600]  doubly allows it so they can act as a publisher but then to give an immunity
[25:43.600 --> 25:48.240]  something TV radio and newsprint don't get so this is a whole new system for
[25:48.240 --> 25:55.000]  the royalty that is big tech and when we come back I'm gonna play it it's
[25:55.000 --> 26:05.800]  disgusting Tim Cook a truly monstrous corporate kingpin on just a scale
[26:05.800 --> 26:10.560]  never before seen the support of the rounding up of dissidents the support
[26:10.560 --> 26:14.920]  of oppressing their own employees in China the fact they become state-run all
[26:14.920 --> 26:19.760]  the terrible things they're involved in supporting the censorship in China
[26:19.760 --> 26:23.280]  telling the Chinese government he totally supports them and saying by the
[26:23.280 --> 26:28.280]  way I'll support censorship here in America or Europe he sent up his flag of
[26:28.280 --> 26:36.440]  not of surrender but of total embrace of authoritarianism and he leads the pack
[26:36.440 --> 26:42.640]  with all the other big tech giants like the Pied Piper leading rats then later
[26:42.640 --> 26:49.960]  your children right down a pit we're already here it's already happening we
[26:49.960 --> 26:53.200]  knew after I was banned four months ago it accelerate everybody else and now
[26:53.200 --> 26:59.000]  it's here and Trump's given this multi hundred page document with all these
[26:59.000 --> 27:04.080]  subtext thousands of pages and shown the numbers that it's got tens of you know
[27:04.080 --> 27:07.760]  billions more per month the better deals for us so he thinks okay that's a better
[27:07.760 --> 27:12.560]  deal I'll go with it he signs off on it declares victory and now it's sales
[27:12.560 --> 27:17.320]  into the house and Senate for ratification in the Senate and it is a
[27:17.320 --> 27:22.000]  nightmare situation we'll go over those subsections for you coming up let me
[27:22.000 --> 27:26.920]  tell you something no matter what they push and no matter what they do now
[27:26.920 --> 27:29.720]  that we're aware to this no matter how much censorship there is they're never
[27:29.720 --> 27:33.640]  going to get away with globalism now we're gonna go to break come back at

[33:01.280 --> 33:21.640]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show leading a frontal assault on the lives
[33:21.640 --> 33:34.480]  of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones. George Herbert Walker Bush why they
[33:34.480 --> 33:38.800]  memorialized what he does at the German death cult at Stirling Bones Lodge 322
[33:38.800 --> 33:43.160]  New Heaven Connecticut what was it 10 years ago Robert De Niro produced a movie
[33:43.160 --> 33:49.240]  with Matt Damon playing the part of an outsider one outsider years brought into
[33:49.240 --> 33:54.320]  the elite blue blood organization where they have gay sex and worship the
[33:54.320 --> 34:01.280]  devil and are reborn in coffins while masturbating that's right then Garrison
[34:01.280 --> 34:05.120]  has got a new graphic out pretty powerful it's on info wars.com on the right
[34:05.120 --> 34:12.040]  hand bottom corner in the cartoon area says hey this is not initiation this
[34:12.040 --> 34:19.240]  time Poppy when he crawled into that coffin George H.W. Bush 1924 1918 we wish
[34:19.240 --> 34:26.840]  him happy trails. Here's from the Good Shepherd. This buttercup scone bones
[34:26.840 --> 34:36.640]  accept or reject. Accept. I don't wear it to anyone.
[34:36.640 --> 34:45.920]  There's a few being a woman. Why do you want to know? Gentlemen I will remind you
[34:45.920 --> 34:51.840]  you've all taken an oath of secrecy. You have been chosen to become members of
[34:51.840 --> 35:00.200]  America's secret society. For over a hundred years scone bones members
[35:00.200 --> 35:07.160]  included a president, vice president, supreme court justices, congressman and
[35:07.160 --> 35:36.840]  senators, captains of science and industry, the very best of America.
[35:36.840 --> 35:42.440]  You can't take it personally. Getting pissed on is personal Mr. Russell. I take it very personally.
[35:42.440 --> 35:46.400]  Edward, we're all in this together.
[35:46.400 --> 35:57.040]  Go back inside. Your brother's life. Tell us Mr. Wilson, brother to brother, something you've never told anyone before.
[35:57.040 --> 36:01.040]  Your most guarded secret.
[36:01.040 --> 36:13.360]  And there he is climbing into that coffin. I would go on air 23 years ago and
[36:13.360 --> 36:17.920]  talk about scone bones that was a fact. They had newspaper articles saying I was
[36:17.920 --> 36:26.960]  insane that it did not exist. Folks asked why Arnold Schwarzenegger and George
[36:26.960 --> 36:31.520]  Walker Bush were such buddies. Well his dad, Schwarzenegger's, was an SS officer
[36:31.520 --> 36:38.880]  and went through similar death cult rituals in Germany. And I know that from
[36:38.880 --> 36:45.720]  history but also from Helmut Schmidt, former German Chancellor, wrote a book
[36:45.720 --> 36:51.120]  Men and Powers, a political retrospective, and he said I really like the
[36:51.120 --> 36:57.120]  the death cults you have in America like Scull and Bones and Bohemian Grove.
[36:57.120 --> 37:02.760]  You can read this book at the library. But he said we really do it right where it started in good old
[37:02.760 --> 37:08.800]  Deutschland. So if you look at the iconography and things of that, it's
[37:08.800 --> 37:16.120]  very similar. That's where it comes from. Now my whole point is that you've got
[37:16.120 --> 37:21.440]  the image of George Herbert Walker Bush out there and then you've got the real person
[37:21.440 --> 37:25.280]  all things he's been involved in and I'm not trying to sit here and speak ill
[37:25.280 --> 37:29.480]  of the dead. I'm simply pointing out that I'm not gonna lie to my audience and say
[37:29.480 --> 37:34.800]  how great Mr. New World Order, Mr. World Government was or is. You know they were
[37:34.800 --> 37:40.280]  so arrogant that they thought that they could censor just a little bit because
[37:40.280 --> 37:43.760]  the internet wasn't that important no one ever listened to us. But now that they
[37:43.760 --> 37:50.320]  know that the American people and others around the world are awake to them. Now
[37:50.320 --> 37:54.800]  that they know that humanity is awake, they're making their big move. And after
[37:54.800 --> 37:59.320]  Roger Stone leaves us, I'm gonna do this next hour. We'll talk about it now. I'm
[37:59.320 --> 38:09.080]  going to play Tim Cook getting an ADL award for banning Alex Jones and other
[38:09.080 --> 38:13.760]  conservatives and it is an incredibly disgusting speech. And then the ADL went
[38:13.760 --> 38:20.480]  on to demonize me from the same podium and it really is outrageous. When you
[38:20.480 --> 38:27.200]  know about the ADL and how they actually go after people that are pro-Israel or
[38:27.200 --> 38:33.560]  pro-Netanyahu and how they support Soros, the Nazi collaborator and Arnold
[38:33.560 --> 38:38.880]  Schwarzenegger and others and then literally are these anti-free speech
[38:38.880 --> 38:46.200]  venomous groups out there using the Holocaust as a reason that Americans
[38:46.200 --> 38:48.880]  should lose their free speech. It was Hitler that got rid of the free speech
[38:48.880 --> 38:54.680]  and the book burning. So the ADL is nothing but a anti-free speech
[38:54.680 --> 39:02.960]  coalition masquerading as a Jewish civil rights organization and I mean we
[39:02.960 --> 39:06.960]  even had that Benjamin Netanyahu come out and say it's okay to criticize Soros
[39:06.960 --> 39:11.280]  should I am a Semitic. I mean George Soros was a Nazi collaborator. George
[39:11.280 --> 39:14.840]  Soros believes the state of Israel should not exist. So American Jews
[39:14.840 --> 39:18.080]  particularly should really be asking yourself the question. I mean I know most
[39:18.080 --> 39:22.480]  of you don't support the ADL but my god that's how crazy the left's gotten where
[39:22.480 --> 39:29.840]  the ADL was in the news last week saying anyone against drag queen story time
[39:29.840 --> 39:33.680]  of your five-year-old having a big fat guy on a wig shake his butt in your kids
[39:33.680 --> 39:38.600]  face and tell them that they're another sex. If you're against creepy men coming
[39:38.600 --> 39:42.240]  and talking to your kids that you're a bad person they're gonna they're gonna
[39:42.240 --> 39:47.080]  call you out. Well you just called yourself out. I've got a new report here
[39:47.080 --> 39:50.840]  where a grandfather found out his two-year-old in in daycare was being
[39:50.840 --> 39:53.960]  put in a dress and told he was a girl and the news is like how dare you not
[39:53.960 --> 39:57.560]  want your two-year-old to be traumatized like this and put in a dress. You know
[39:57.560 --> 40:01.040]  you tell people approach little kids and told them about sexual stuff they got
[40:01.040 --> 40:08.600]  put in jail but now as long as you say it's liberal it's a good thing ladies
[40:08.600 --> 40:14.480]  and gentlemen. So we're gonna be looking at all that after Roger leaves us after
[40:14.480 --> 40:21.440]  Roger leaves us as well but I wanted to get him on particularly in the next
[40:21.440 --> 40:29.080]  segment but also part of this segment on the latest Mueller behavior and they
[40:29.080 --> 40:32.000]  you know claimed that this whole jack-in-the-box that we haven't seen is
[40:32.000 --> 40:35.560]  about to pop out that's coming up but first I wanted to hit the really big
[40:35.560 --> 40:38.800]  one not the censorship of infill wars which we do as the first domino but
[40:38.800 --> 40:45.160]  everybody else. Now the USMCA entrenched his tech companies right to censor
[40:45.160 --> 40:53.040]  buried in the new NAFTA renegotiation are two subsections that end free speech
[40:53.040 --> 40:56.760]  as we know it and give the tech companies everything they want so instead
[40:56.760 --> 41:00.880]  of having legislation defending free speech we're getting legislation
[41:00.880 --> 41:04.640]  codifying the end of free speech. Roger obviously the president who's been
[41:04.640 --> 41:07.880]  critical of this is not aware of what was in the overall plan he just saw the
[41:07.880 --> 41:10.480]  basic numbers it's still got to be ratified we've got to get this to the
[41:10.480 --> 41:15.440]  president. Alex I couldn't agree more first of all I want to commend the folks
[41:15.440 --> 41:20.680]  at Breitbart for breaking this news. Look I have known the president for 40
[41:20.680 --> 41:26.080]  years and he's a big picture guy and very clearly they slipped in some things
[41:26.080 --> 41:31.520]  here in the small print that he's probably not aware of but access to a
[41:31.520 --> 41:39.160]  free accessible vibrant and robust internet is absolutely crucial to the
[41:39.160 --> 41:44.440]  future of the Trump reform agenda it's crucial to his prospects for re-election
[41:44.440 --> 41:48.600]  it's crucial to the progress he makes for the country over the next two years
[41:48.600 --> 41:54.880]  and it's crucial to his legacy it may be crucial to his survival in a showdown
[41:54.880 --> 41:59.920]  with a rogue federal prosecutor who has no interest in the crimes of the
[41:59.920 --> 42:05.000]  Obamas and the Clintons but seems very focused on removing Donald Trump for
[42:05.000 --> 42:12.080]  office so in essence by signing this the president is unilaterally
[42:12.080 --> 42:18.040]  surrendering his ability to communicate in the coming showdown and I find that
[42:18.040 --> 42:21.200]  very troubling. I was about to say remember what Lenin said give me control
[42:21.200 --> 42:25.760]  the telephones the radio and the trains I'll control your country well that's
[42:25.760 --> 42:29.920]  what this is and he's allowing them to see his control but you see him in the
[42:29.920 --> 42:33.800]  news they brag oh we didn't like his executive order so he never filed it when
[42:33.800 --> 42:38.440]  he signed it or oh we just changed it last minute haha that idiot signed it
[42:38.440 --> 42:41.560]  because so he's up there delegating trying to get a ton of stuff done
[42:41.560 --> 42:46.560]  surrounded by a bunch of knuckle dragging cowards who thought they'd sneak
[42:46.560 --> 42:50.000]  this through by stealth that we're here our audience is here despite all their
[42:50.000 --> 42:54.080]  attacks to raise the alarm this is a critical action agenda when we come back
[42:54.080 --> 42:59.320]  we'll give you the details of the subsections on the other side. The
[42:59.320 --> 43:02.920]  globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the
[43:02.920 --> 43:06.440]  environment full of the bad halogens fluoride chlorine bromide you name it
[43:06.440 --> 43:12.320]  that it lowers IQ it literally dumps the population down and on our quest to
[43:12.320 --> 43:16.120]  bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world we've gone through
[43:16.120 --> 43:21.280]  two permutations first seaweed based iodine that was pretty good but hard to
[43:21.280 --> 43:24.680]  source and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it so we
[43:24.680 --> 43:29.280]  discovered deep earth crystals a pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's
[43:29.280 --> 43:33.120]  been incredible now due to the establishment trying to block that we
[43:33.120 --> 43:37.560]  did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine
[43:37.560 --> 43:42.320]  but chemist scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it
[43:42.320 --> 43:47.840]  with three other compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin C it super charges it
[43:47.840 --> 43:53.000]  and makes it even more bio available ladies and gentlemen you want to
[43:53.000 --> 43:57.600]  research it you want to see it it's an incredible discovery X3 now available

[46:50.480 --> 46:54.700]  2018 has been an incredible year and as we prepare to close it out I want to thank
[46:54.700 --> 46:59.480]  you all again for making the entire InfoWars possible. Again you are the
[46:59.480 --> 47:01.680]  resistance.
[47:01.680 --> 47:21.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:21.640 --> 47:30.000]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report. It's Alex Jones. Well we
[47:30.000 --> 47:34.040]  know the exact shape of the international takeover of our free
[47:34.040 --> 47:38.000]  speech, the attempt to block the populist nationalist movement spreading
[47:38.000 --> 47:42.480]  across the world and that means we know how to beat them but we've got to take
[47:42.480 --> 47:47.400]  action. So major action plans straight ahead. The main reason they want to try
[47:47.400 --> 47:52.320]  to silence and block our reach is they want to silence and block your reach.
[47:52.320 --> 47:57.160]  When I say you're the InfoWars that's not me being patronizing that's me on my
[47:57.160 --> 48:02.920]  knees because when you take action nothing on earth can stop you except God
[48:02.920 --> 48:08.640]  and when you don't take action we're screwed and we still have a very large
[48:08.640 --> 48:13.640]  audience I want to be technical here. The core audience is bigger. The overall
[48:13.640 --> 48:18.880]  reach is massively diminished. The globalists have the top universities and
[48:18.880 --> 48:24.000]  the CIA and leftist think tanks all over the news scanning everything we do and
[48:24.000 --> 48:27.560]  you know reporting this is up, that's down. Well we think we kind of beat him but
[48:27.560 --> 48:32.520]  we didn't. I'm giving everyone a real assessment here and it's because they
[48:32.520 --> 48:36.040]  don't want us to be critically analysis. They don't want us to give you
[48:36.040 --> 48:40.680]  critical analysis of what's really going on. That's why they're having ADL
[48:40.680 --> 48:47.240]  leftist dinners where they call Trump and anti-Semite which is just
[48:47.240 --> 48:53.120]  asinine but they ought to have Hitler host one of these dinners. They're so
[48:53.120 --> 48:58.840]  anti-Israel. It's just upside down world man and celebrating and giving awards out
[48:58.840 --> 49:04.160]  for shutting me down. I'll play it all next hour. It's on infowars.com and
[49:04.160 --> 49:12.440]  newswars.com. So I want to get Roger's take on that but but but also the idea
[49:12.440 --> 49:19.000]  that we can't speak out against this. Roger says Mueller's a fraud. Of course he
[49:19.000 --> 49:25.520]  says he's a fraud and the news goes oh you're messing with an investigation.
[49:25.520 --> 49:29.040]  You're witness tampering and they've charged a bunch of people with it and
[49:29.040 --> 49:35.640]  then Trump see stone on Stephanopoulos on National Sunday Morning Show saying
[49:35.640 --> 49:40.880]  he Trump's done nothing so I couldn't ever sell him out to Mueller. I never will
[49:40.880 --> 49:45.720]  because there is no Russia collusion. There's nothing which we all know and oh
[49:45.720 --> 49:49.200]  my god it I mean it was the top three were thousands of articles just everywhere.
[49:49.200 --> 49:56.640]  Oh boy they had nine liberal professors all say he's witness tampering and he's
[49:56.640 --> 50:01.920]  a criminal and stones one two and he needs to be president he's to be impeached
[50:01.920 --> 50:08.280]  and arrested right now and it goes on and on and on and on and on for Trump
[50:08.280 --> 50:11.680]  saying there's a public figure who hasn't even been questioned who hasn't been
[50:11.680 --> 50:15.880]  indicted who isn't in the court case saying I won't lie because there's nothing
[50:15.880 --> 50:21.520]  to lie about and because he opened his mouth that is turned in to the thousands
[50:21.520 --> 50:25.760]  of papers attacking that the president every day and Roger Stone and myself and
[50:25.760 --> 50:32.720]  Corsi if we even speak back to this God creature Robert Mueller I mean he is the
[50:32.720 --> 50:36.800]  fifth branch of government it's like he gave birth to Jesus he is he's just
[50:36.800 --> 50:41.440]  this he's this inquisitor how many times in history did they start a special
[50:41.440 --> 50:45.520]  investigation that got out of control and even took over the Catholic Church or
[50:45.520 --> 50:48.520]  took over France or took over England this is beyond a witch hunt this is a
[50:48.520 --> 50:54.840]  criminal rogue state inquisition Roger Stone and and just to watch them turn
[50:54.840 --> 51:01.600]  everything wholesome and good Corsi having the nerve to come out and say
[51:01.600 --> 51:05.520]  they tell me why I won't lie he should say that if it's the truth which it is
[51:05.520 --> 51:08.920]  and then you got Mueller in bed with the Russians in bed with Hillary the
[51:08.920 --> 51:13.160]  prosecutors literally involved in uranium one this would be funny if it
[51:13.160 --> 51:20.320]  wasn't so ridiculous I'll say it again this is on par with having Jeffrey Dahmer
[51:20.320 --> 51:26.800]  be the judge in a case of cannibalism or Hitler sitting in judgment at
[51:26.800 --> 51:33.040]  Nuremberg of other US troops like they were Nazis Roger Stone give me your take
[51:33.040 --> 51:38.600]  on this well Alex the part of it that's the most disturbing look I'm a veteran
[51:38.600 --> 51:42.800]  of 40 years in American politics I've been through 10 national presidential
[51:42.800 --> 51:47.240]  campaigns and when it comes to the mainstream media I've always tried to
[51:47.240 --> 51:52.000]  coexist with them I've taken the good with the bad some were more biased than
[51:52.000 --> 51:56.960]  others if you were even honest today however the mainstream media the New
[51:56.960 --> 52:01.200]  York Times the Washington Post and particularly the Wall Street Journal are
[52:01.200 --> 52:06.840]  in bed with a false narrative regarding the Mueller investigation Roger Stone
[52:06.840 --> 52:13.720]  Jerry Corsi WikiLeaks Russian collusion which is essentially non-existent to an
[52:13.720 --> 52:19.920]  extent that I have never seen willful deceptions half truths the recycling of
[52:19.920 --> 52:25.000]  items that they know have been either discredited or fully explained on the
[52:25.000 --> 52:29.240]  record in the past there's and there's no correcting them they won't be
[52:29.240 --> 52:36.680]  corrected there's no civility having Vox come up with nine experts all of
[52:36.680 --> 52:43.040]  whom are drooling anti-trump leftists saying oh yes the president definitely
[52:43.040 --> 52:48.680]  was involved in witness tampering because he prayed praised my statement
[52:48.680 --> 52:53.000]  that I would not bear false witness against him that no amount of pressure
[52:53.000 --> 52:59.000]  on me would cause me to lie about the president it's mind-boggling interviewing
[52:59.000 --> 53:04.840]  a guy named Renato Mariotti I know honesty what I leave on the toilet paper
[53:04.840 --> 53:11.320]  is more intelligent than this guy and his bias is is so very clear so I've
[53:11.320 --> 53:21.920]  never seen this mainstream media tight coordination with the deep state as as
[53:21.920 --> 53:28.120]  as is exhaustive and complete as I see today it's really mind-boggling you're
[53:28.120 --> 53:32.600]  a public figure you go on a national show and say the president never did
[53:32.600 --> 53:36.800]  anything so I could never throw him under the bus because I wouldn't lie that
[53:36.800 --> 53:41.840]  turns into witness tampering because the president says man I'm glad you've got
[53:41.840 --> 53:46.120]  guts other people haven't had guts like Cohen and others which Trump has every
[53:46.120 --> 53:50.600]  right to say you're a damn liar you get busted laundering 15 million dollars in
[53:50.600 --> 53:53.800]  your cab company that I have nothing to do with Trump says and now you're
[53:53.800 --> 53:57.080]  telling lies about me when earlier you said never did any of this you're a
[53:57.080 --> 54:03.320]  little rat that is absolutely the case so now defending yourself is evil
[54:03.320 --> 54:07.680]  shifting gears Roger and let's go to the next segment on this obviously the
[54:07.680 --> 54:14.840]  big enchilada is if we don't stop the censorship it's it's done because we
[54:14.840 --> 54:19.160]  can't even defend ourselves against the lies and all the big tech censorship had
[54:19.160 --> 54:22.920]  nothing to do with the reasons they said now they're giving Tim Cook awards for
[54:22.920 --> 54:29.840]  it Trump has shined the new NAFTA US MCA deal which on balance is a better deal
[54:29.840 --> 54:37.160]  for us is on a one-way trade deal but it codifies in the subsections that will
[54:37.160 --> 54:42.040]  cover in the next section that total censorship is authorized and they're
[54:42.040 --> 54:47.560]  given immunity this must be killed in the ratification process well Alex I
[54:47.560 --> 54:51.560]  think timing is everything and the president's got to make two decisions
[54:51.560 --> 54:57.280]  and he's got to do it pronto one is to call the bluff of the deep state and
[54:57.280 --> 55:06.440]  expose Mahler Rosenstein Zelinsky the Clintons the Obama's Brennan clapper at
[55:06.440 --> 55:11.440]  all for their use of illegal unconstitutional surveillance on his
[55:11.440 --> 55:17.280]  campaign and for their infiltration of his campaign by the FBI and he has to
[55:17.280 --> 55:22.800]  move against net censorship so the American people can understand exactly
[55:22.800 --> 55:29.000]  what he is doing and why failure to do these two things and do them soon will
[55:29.000 --> 55:33.920]  give the upper hand to his critics and will pave the way for his impeachment
[55:33.920 --> 55:39.160]  and removal make no mistake about it that is the game plan the more they
[55:39.160 --> 55:44.840]  deny it the more I am certain of it and if the House Democrats cannot bring
[55:44.840 --> 55:48.600]  articles of impeachment against the president on the basis of Russian
[55:48.600 --> 55:54.800]  collusion based on a lack of evidence then they will prop up false charges of
[55:54.800 --> 55:58.800]  sir sexual harassment but that's right stay there we're gonna come back and
[55:58.800 --> 56:02.600]  talk about that with Roger Stone then I'm gonna get into the specifics of the

[59:58.480 --> 01:00:06.960]  it seems like yesterday
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:19.200]  but it was long ago it was long ago we had a first amendment America and they
[01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:25.200]  didn't try to teach our five-year-olds how to give more jobs in public school
[01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:34.760]  but now now half of us have got autism and the other half of got cancer and the
[01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:39.680]  churches are all closed in and world governments here and Tim Cook's running
[01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:45.520]  slave factories and he's gonna take the rest of your freedom that's right
[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:51.680]  you like that Roger I can sing discordantly over the wrong lyrics
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:57.080]  that's like cats howling in the back of the trash pile but it's it's what we do
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:01:01.880]  here pull something special hey Roger getting serious I've been ranting Raven
[01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:04.240]  here I've been saying I don't want to hear about the
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:07.800]  Russiagate things it's all bull but now it's coming to the big head they say the
[01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:11.240]  big end game the building blocks you were saying the whole time of course it's
[01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:15.240]  aimed at Trump of course they're gonna try impeachment the president believed
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:19.560]  his lawyers now he's pissed but he just has to take action what did you make of
[01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:23.520]  him and we'll roll some of that b-roll where he walks off the stage the G20
[01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:27.400]  yesterday and when they wanted to do the group photo and just says just get me
[01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:32.120]  out of here I think he was just letting them know piss on you well I think the
[01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:37.200]  president's patients have run out but we're back to the same cul-de-sac where
[01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:42.760]  he's let the world know that he gets what's afoot that he has the detonator in
[01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:47.360]  his hands Devin Nunes the courageous chairman of the House Intelligence
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:52.280]  Committee has let it be known that the president has information his hands that
[01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:56.600]  if he declassifies it will send most of the top Democrats in the previous
[01:01:56.600 --> 01:02:02.720]  administration to prison and again the president's advisors are urging him to
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:08.600]  wait wait for what wait for articles of impeachment to be voted wait for your
[01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:12.640]  trial in the US Senate that's because they've all been told by the deep state
[01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:16.520]  you help us sandbag the president we won't destroy you they've all done it out
[01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:21.280]  of cowardice well unfortunately most of them came from the deep state to begin
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:25.560]  with I mean the president's son-in-law has recommended people for the White
[01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:30.440]  House staff who did not vote for Donald Trump did not support his campaign do
[01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:34.000]  not what about Conway's husband literally saying the president should be
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:39.080]  arrested for witness tampering I mean it's just what the hell man yeah that
[01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:42.760]  guy's a clown I'm looking forward to seeing him at Christmas he is uh he is a
[01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:48.480]  knack this is this would be laughable if it weren't so serious the president has
[01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:53.080]  to wake up and take action or they will move on him I think this is abundantly
[01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:57.080]  clear Alex you're coming to south Florida between Christmas and New Year's
[01:02:57.080 --> 01:03:01.440]  and we're going to be doing some things to bring this very forcefully to the
[01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:05.760]  president's attention oh so you okay we haven't working this out yet so you
[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:09.920]  think we should let people know no well I don't think we have to tell him
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:15.160]  precisely what we have in mind other than to say you want to come to a warmer
[01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:21.800]  climate between the holidays and you know I think it's important for us to do
[01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:25.360]  some things to draw public attention not only to the issue of internet
[01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:30.840]  censorship but to the peril that this president faces because he's taken on the
[01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:35.280]  globalist because he is trying to remake America and get us back to our
[01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:41.720]  fundamental principles this is why he strikes such fear in the hearts of the
[01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:46.680]  neocons in the two-party duopoly they've run this country into the ground by the
[01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:50.640]  way Roger you're just joking I'm not coming to Florida even though you you
[01:03:50.640 --> 01:04:05.520]  joked about me coming right Roger yeah oh yeah oh yeah you're not coming I get it you are something else we're gonna have to talk about this I know you
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:09.240]  gotta go soon but speaking of the censorship and speaking of reaching out
[01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:13.960]  the president we're gonna go to break we're gonna come back and I just want to
[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:17.840]  spend a minute or two on how the audience can move and and really get this
[01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:21.200]  done because the president's very close to getting it done but they bragged in
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:24.560]  the Wall Street Journal as you said that's like one of the worst publications
[01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:29.200]  now bragged that oh he'll sign an executive order they just ignore it or
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:32.560]  don't file it or he says do this and they go yes sir and don't do it that's
[01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:37.120]  called mutiny and so we keep bitching saying why can't Trump do it it's like
[01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:41.280]  he's trying to build a steel building with with toothpicks or something he
[01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:46.280]  doesn't have any men with steel he doesn't have any men around him that are
[01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:49.200]  willing to fight or stand up that's why they're trying to destroy Roger and I
[01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:53.440]  because we are willing to do it you're willing to do it we'll be right back stay
[01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:55.760]  with us

[01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:31.560]  important than ever that everyone go to info wars comm forward slash newsletter

[01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:05.120]  weeknight broadcast 7 to 10 it's me around table show we're still getting
[01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:09.480]  that lined up and we're doing a lot of expansion around here in the face of the
[01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:16.600]  globalist coming after us now but roger leaves us here in just a few minutes I'm
[01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:22.840]  going to get into the actual treaty that Trump just signed that ends free
[01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:27.320]  speeches we know it now a lot of you are going to say oh my god
[01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:33.520]  Trump just sold us out no the subcontext that that that the multi hundred page
[01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:40.960]  treaty then refers to is thousands of pages long you have to go through the
[01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:46.000]  thousands of pages and it's got a lot of good deals for the US but when it comes
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:50.120]  to censorship it is draconian we're going to be looking at that it'll get
[01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:54.640]  killed during the ratification if we make a big noise about it we're going to
[01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:59.440]  discuss that effect let's discuss that right now roger stone google CEO
[01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:04.440]  sundar pachari is also scared to testify in congress December 11th he refused to
[01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:11.840]  testify before on why he's moved to communist China why he's censoring and
[01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:15.440]  why he won't work with the Pentagon on AI but works with the Chinese military
[01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:19.240]  it's called treason that's why so we're going to be looking at all of that as
[01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:23.840]  well but us mca that's the new replacement for naftan gatt trump
[01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:27.040]  negotiated a lot of it it is not perfect it's way better than that then
[01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:31.800]  gatt was done all one-sided president trump hailed the trade agreement he
[01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:36.840]  signed with mexico and canada last week as great for all our countries perhaps he
[01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:42.240]  doesn't know that the NAFTA replacing trade agreement us mca gives tech
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:45.920]  giants in silicon valley a special legal privilege to censor his own
[01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:49.680]  supporters anyone else they find it quote objectionable that's in the section
[01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:53.680]  just objectionable facebook twitter google and youtube all engage in
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:56.360]  pre-election censorship against republicans and trump supporters yet
[01:08:56.360 --> 01:09:00.480]  they managed to sneak a liability protection into president trumps trade
[01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:05.160]  bill that would make it even easier for them to censor their own users and you
[01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:08.040]  gotta love old jaren kusher but you know he's been involved in this whole
[01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:12.960]  negotiation and i'm always seeing him rubbing elbows with the googles and the
[01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:16.360]  facebook ease and all them and and i get he probably wants them to be nice to
[01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:20.360]  trump but they've not been they've gang raped america and trump and so i just
[01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:24.840]  hope jared advised we know he will jared good old patriot i just hope jared
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:27.160]  will advise the president to make sure this gets pulled out before it's
[01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:33.240]  ratified us mca entrenched the tech giants legal protection under section 230
[01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:37.680]  of the communications decency act which grants them legal immunity this is key
[01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:42.480]  for user-generated content that's worldwide that works like that this is
[01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:45.120]  an important part of the law that allows tech platforms to host a wide variety
[01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:50.640]  of speech with light touch moderation only if it's criminal and that's how
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:53.360]  they're not liable like a newspaper or tv station radio station they're not a
[01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:59.200]  publisher but the usmca also entrenched his tech companies right to censor
[01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:04.560]  without liability article 19.17 of the trade agreement gives tech companies
[01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:09.440]  immunity from any lawsuits arising from actions taken to restrict material it
[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:13.680]  considers to be harmful or objectionable that's pandora's box the entire
[01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:17.040]  universe section 230 has a similarly problematic provision
[01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:20.480]  which needs to be amended by the next congress if the censorship of the
[01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:24.320]  internet is to be stopped and it goes on to point out that it has to be
[01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:28.080]  ratified and that we must block it so let's stop it right there
[01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:32.000]  i will say i admire the president i love the president i'm with the president
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:35.280]  and i know he'll do the right thing when he gets the right advice is roger
[01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:39.120]  scone said ad nauseam but this is my lie in the sand
[01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:45.360]  it is my rubicon river if this gets ratified by the republican controlled
[01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:50.720]  senate if trump does not act against this
[01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:53.760]  then it means that he is capitulating to the dims
[01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:57.040]  and has thought that they've won and that america failed because he's really
[01:10:57.040 --> 01:11:01.440]  been trying so far and that he's signaling the white flag because
[01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:04.640]  you're not allowed to just sign over our first amendment
[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:08.720]  you're not allowed to do all this and and look trump has been the biggest
[01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:11.840]  person criticizing this he's been ordering the justice department to come
[01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:14.560]  up with systems to stop it so i guarantee you like
[01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:17.600]  everything else they brag in the news like he's an idiot
[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:20.160]  well when he signs an executive award a lot of times we just hide it he never
[01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:22.000]  knows because he's so busy on the next thing
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.880]  tell you get so much done he delegates like they're gonna follow orders
[01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:28.160]  and you know we routinely just deep six stuff and hold it we don't let him see
[01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:32.160]  info or is my god or bright part no don't let who got you elected you know
[01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:35.280]  you're sure but but more and more trump is going and
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:37.600]  looking for those things he's not allowed to have
[01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:40.560]  like they told him look alex jones and paul watson edited this video of a
[01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:42.480]  costume he said no they didn't they zoomed in on it
[01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:46.640]  that's not doctrine so so i know trouble the right thing but as listeners
[01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:51.600]  as constituents as citizens as fellow travelers against the globalist
[01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:55.040]  you've got to call the white house you've got to talk to everybody you know
[01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:58.640]  that lives in marlago you've got to talk to chris ruddy who's good buddies with
[01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:02.640]  the president all of you have got to be citizen activist lobbyist
[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:06.640]  and have got a lot of big old fire under uh the entire
[01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:10.160]  ash of those traders in the white house that are
[01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:13.520]  double dealing the public and blocking the president
[01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:19.360]  and you've got to go to right trump dot com we are going to deliver
[01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:22.640]  and you know i'll say this it's crazy sometimes i do a write-in deal we get
[01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:25.120]  100 000 signatures right away which we had delivered
[01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:28.560]  we only had like 50 000 and that's great but it's write trump dot com
[01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:31.200]  it's our letter roger and i wrote you can write in your own letter
[01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:35.840]  you can print it off and mail it to marlago or to the white house or to
[01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:39.280]  trump tower in new york or the trump facility in new jersey you pick where
[01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:42.640]  you want to go but we will mail them all we've decided
[01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:46.560]  we're going to target uh marlago and several other places
[01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:50.160]  but we're getting the first 30 or 40 000 that came in the last few weeks those
[01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:53.360]  are being packaged in envelopes they're being having
[01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:57.120]  you know if you give us your name it's put on there if not it's it's it's it's
[01:12:57.120 --> 01:13:00.880]  our name it's being mailed so he can trump pays attention to this we've got
[01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:05.600]  other stuff going on afoot but you need to go to right trump dot com
[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:09.120]  and look don't listen to me don't just mail our letter go get the bright bar
[01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:12.720]  article and put it in envelope and mail it call the white house switchboard
[01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:17.200]  this president values you he has his ear to the ground
[01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:21.120]  so these arrogance obese think we're beat they're not of you take action
[01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:25.040]  roger you got two and a half minutes so put a bow on this force
[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:28.320]  you know alex i'm highly confident that the president is completely
[01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:31.840]  unaware of this small print that was slipped into a deal
[01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:35.920]  it's actually a very good deal for america when it comes to job creation
[01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:40.880]  and economic expansion this is head and shoulders better than nafta or tpp or
[01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:45.360]  the other multi international one size fits all trade deals
[01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:49.600]  that were given to us by the bushes the clintons and the obamas
[01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:54.880]  that said the president's legacy his prospects for re-election the future
[01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:59.440]  of his reform agenda are completely wrapped up in the need
[01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:05.040]  for an unfettered access to the internet this is where trump supporters
[01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:08.640]  communicate and without it the president is doomed
[01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:12.240]  i am convinced once he understands the stakes once he
[01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:16.400]  he identifies the small print that this is imminently
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:19.600]  stoppable also i believe we can put pressure on the
[01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:24.240]  republicans in congress to recognize the peril involved for them
[01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:27.360]  if they didn't experience it in the 2018 election
[01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:30.640]  i don't know when they are going to wake up because
[01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:34.560]  that's a precursor if you'd like the results of the last elections
[01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:38.800]  that's what happens when they censor the president's supporters
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:43.440]  on the internet that's the inside story had we had full access to the internet
[01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:46.480]  the last of elections we wouldn't have lost the house
[01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:52.560]  so the time is short the stakes are high but donald trump's heart is true
[01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:55.360]  he gets it and when this is brought to his attention
[01:14:55.360 --> 01:15:00.480]  i believe he'll do the right thing that's right and if you look at the section
[01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:03.920]  230 of our law and it's also international law
[01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:07.680]  it makes sense it's your third party posts on your platform as long as it's
[01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:11.200]  not illegal you're not liable for what they say they can be sued for what they
[01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:14.160]  say you can't so as long as it's not gambling child
[01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:17.840]  porn you know whatever you're not liable well they're keeping that but then
[01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:21.600]  saying but we're allowed to control what goes out and control anything we find
[01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:24.880]  objectionable so they're actually a publisher that
[01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:28.560]  gives them unfair trade advantage against tv stations radio stations and
[01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:32.080]  newspapers uh and so this is a whole new system it's
[01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:35.440]  very dangerous but the the perfect storm roger as you know is
[01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:38.560]  old media is dying establishment government's in trouble
[01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:41.440]  they want to censor everybody and so that's why they're all
[01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:45.520]  getting on board with this dr connie and censorship roger stone with news wars

[01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:37.760]  okay i'm gonna be just 110 honest with the public here and the viewers and
[01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:45.520]  listeners i cannot stand talking about myself on there
[01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:49.360]  but i've got to talk about myself because so many times we're the center of news
[01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:53.040]  and to also understand how the propaganda works it's a real
[01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:56.640]  learning experience for myself and everybody else so
[01:20:56.640 --> 01:21:00.320]  we're in the news every day every hour and i don't counter
[01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:07.600]  one one hundredth of the lies but when they demonize me and lie about
[01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:11.360]  info wars and lie about all of you and who we are that's really who they're
[01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:15.280]  lying about that's who they fear is you i'm not being patronizing to make you
[01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:19.040]  feel important they hate an awake active focused
[01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:22.320]  population they hate you knowing you've got
[01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:25.200]  community they hate you knowing we're having success around the world with
[01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:28.880]  populism and nationalism and a reassert as a christianity as
[01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:35.440]  christians are being persecuted but when they then have somebody
[01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:40.800]  like tim cook who openly says he wants to censor the
[01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:48.000]  us and china and loves authoritarianism and runs the worst slave factories
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:53.040]  where if they try to unionize he just calls the chikoms they come kill them
[01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:57.280]  i mean there there are thousands of articles about this he put your apple
[01:21:57.280 --> 01:22:02.080]  code your your i cloud code a year ago on the chinese government database
[01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:07.680]  their state run i mean the guy has gotten away with stuff that is mind
[01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:11.120]  blowing but it shows that's why they didn't go
[01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:15.200]  after the first amendment here because they've gotten away with so much so a
[01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:21.200]  few months ago he was asked by vice television hbo
[01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:25.840]  vice i guess not particular host but that channel that you know took some time
[01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:29.920]  off from promoting pedophilia to go actually do a decent job
[01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:34.320]  and and and this reporter uh actually asked him about you know it's kind of
[01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:37.120]  scary just deep sixing alex jones he says well
[01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:43.440]  we just curated it like a museum now you fast forward he's talking about me
[01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:46.320]  because they just introduced him and said my name
[01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:50.160]  he's talking about he's getting an award from the adl for banning alex jones
[01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:54.400]  and he says well it's because i'm promoting violence
[01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:57.280]  remember before they totally took me off of the platform so i couldn't respond
[01:22:57.280 --> 01:23:00.800]  to their lies they were saying that i said get your battle
[01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:04.560]  rifles and attack the media there was no video there was no audio
[01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:08.800]  there was no text it was a lie but see now that tim cook thinks that
[01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:12.400]  i've been silenced except for info wars dot com and news wars dot com and
[01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:16.160]  talk radio and tv which is still substantive
[01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:19.920]  and you can still send our links via text or via email and that's
[01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:24.160]  incredibly powerful if you'll do it repeatedly he thinks now
[01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:29.200]  he's got air superiority round like a caveman down here he can just bomb
[01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:35.840]  with lies and nobody can respond and so we are the patient zero we are the
[01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:38.880]  test case we are the beta test for all this
[01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:45.680]  and now the adl that's been convicted of stealing police files on people
[01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:49.920]  and convicted of framing people and convicted
[01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:55.440]  of and found you know in court over and over again
[01:23:55.440 --> 01:23:58.480]  for defamation
[01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:03.840]  where if you know a theater chain owner
[01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:08.320]  bought up some theaters that the adl did like they just call them anti-semitic
[01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:11.280]  so basically you just give them a donation and they'll call somebody
[01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:15.120]  anti-semitic america beat hitler america's been an
[01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:18.880]  incredibly open country but then we're scared of being called
[01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:21.680]  anti-semitic so they even call netanyahu anti-semitic because he doesn't
[01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:26.320]  want george soros the nazi collaborator that the adl gives awards to
[01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:29.280]  to literally
[01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:36.320]  overthrow israel that's how crazy the leftist adl is and that's what it is
[01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:40.560]  it's leftist not a jewish organization it's a leftist organization
[01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:45.440]  the leftist mafia organization that lies and so here comes tim cook this big
[01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:48.560]  gangster that helps china round up its political dissidents
[01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:54.480]  who who runs the worst factories and he gets into it's a sin
[01:24:55.760 --> 01:25:00.560]  now he's a preacher to not remove people like alex jones
[01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:07.040]  talk about sick this guy he has blood all over his hands he is
[01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:12.240]  beyond robber barons and books like the jungle
[01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:17.440]  but but here he is earlier just saying it was curation because i'm this bad guy
[01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:21.600]  now it's because i'm violent and i'm evil
[01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:25.120]  and so no need to show what i did they can just lie
[01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:30.880]  because he thinks he's invincible here it is here because there is a concerted
[01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:34.640]  effort by the democratic party and multinational corporations in big tech
[01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:38.080]  to silence conservative and nationalist and populist voices ahead
[01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:42.800]  of this critical midterm election so i want to move from one part of the bill
[01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:47.360]  of rights to another freedom of speech yeah how did you decide to ban alex
[01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:50.960]  jones what users want from us and what we've always
[01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:56.080]  provided them is a curated one we think that what the user wants
[01:25:56.080 --> 01:25:59.600]  is someone that does review these apps
[01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:03.600]  someone that uh does review the podcast
[01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:08.960]  someone that on like apple news we're a human by the way hit pause is selecting
[01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:12.240]  i know it's hard to listen to this guy but we're going to start this over
[01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:16.560]  notice that when they have me talking it's scary music like halloween
[01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:19.920]  somebody's coming to stab me to death oh my god i'll show but when tim cook talks
[01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:23.600]  it's like everything gets happy everything gets good
[01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:27.200]  everything gets wonderful because he just wants to help you with his slave
[01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:31.280]  camp serious here because there is a concerted effort
[01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:34.480]  by the democratic party and multinational corporations in big tech
[01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:37.920]  to silence conservative and nationalist and populist voices ahead
[01:26:37.920 --> 01:26:42.560]  of this critical midterm election so i want to move from one part of the bill
[01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:48.240]  of rights to another freedom of speech yeah how did you decide to ban alex jones
[01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:51.600]  what users want from us and what we've always provided them
[01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:55.920]  is a curated one we think that what the user wants
[01:26:55.920 --> 01:27:03.440]  is someone that does review these apps someone that uh does review the podcast
[01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:07.360]  someone that on like apple news we're a human
[01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:11.680]  is selecting the top stories and that's what we do
[01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:16.240]  we don't take a political stand oh no meaning one way or the other oh no
[01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:21.120]  tell that from the stuff on the app store and in podcast etc
[01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:25.120]  you'll see everything from very conservative to very liberal oh yeah
[01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:28.560]  right that's the way i think it should be but at what point where you're like
[01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:32.960]  okay that's it alex jones has to go i i'm you know we get into a singular kind
[01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:36.480]  of event but i think there's a enough there
[01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:43.040]  when the reasonable people could agree like your slave camps in china you're going to curate
[01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:47.120]  that that should be all did you coordinate with other tech companies
[01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:51.440]  to kick off alex jones no no never even had a conversation about this
[01:27:51.440 --> 01:27:58.320]  oh no but why we make we make our we make our
[01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:02.000]  decisions independently and i think that's important
[01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:05.360]  honestly i've had no conversation and to my knowledge
[01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:09.200]  no one in apple has well suddenly it's like a very nice guy and you're
[01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:13.600]  like it's all happy it's very admirable but you're admirable also run a
[01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:16.720]  trillion dollar company which is another way of saying
[01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:22.080]  you have a lot of power so what happens if you change your mind
[01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:25.840]  or the person who comes after you doesn't agree with you
[01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:29.280]  well first of all we don't really think of ourselves as a choice for a company
[01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:32.400]  just to oh we're no big deal yeah in terms of power i've never

[01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:09.040]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:33:09.040 --> 01:33:25.920]  the alex jones show because there is a war on for your mind
[01:33:25.920 --> 01:33:31.520]  there was something so pleasant about that place even your emotions had an echo
[01:33:31.520 --> 01:33:37.360]  in so much space
[01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:41.520]  and when you out there was out there yeah i was out of time
[01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:47.360]  so imagined apple computers well known that if you have an apple device
[01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:51.200]  major shopping carts out there infowarstore doesn't do this but others
[01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:55.440]  do major travel sites hotel sites airline
[01:33:55.440 --> 01:34:00.400]  sites they see you as a schmuck and they charge you more
[01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:06.880]  for the airline tickets for the hotel rooms for all of it
[01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:12.000]  and so it's true that they curate like a like a museum for schmucks
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:17.520]  uh they don't pass up to the top
[01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:21.520]  of apple's websites what is most popular
[01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:27.680]  they decide what you see that's the complete arrogance of a tim cook
[01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:31.040]  and again if you look up foxconn laboratories that they exclusively
[01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:33.920]  contract with the worst slave camps forced abortion forced
[01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:38.080]  drugging working their fingers bloody people
[01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:44.000]  committing suicide suicide nets and tim cook goes to china and encourages them
[01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:47.440]  to be more draconian he encourages them to pay people
[01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:51.200]  less and the party says we're having major riots
[01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:54.320]  because you pay people the lowest level in the country
[01:34:54.320 --> 01:34:57.520]  and he says if you don't like it we're leaving i mean behind the scenes he's
[01:34:57.520 --> 01:35:01.280]  just like i'm in command and he reportedly just goes
[01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:07.120]  but then out in the public i'm tim cook i'm a nice little engineer that
[01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:11.680]  steve jobs beg to run things because i get things done
[01:35:11.680 --> 01:35:17.360]  so they overcharge you they make sure that don't believe me just search engine
[01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:20.880]  chinese communist party tells apple to share the wealth
[01:35:20.880 --> 01:35:25.200]  with the public even the greedy chai coms say man
[01:35:25.200 --> 01:35:32.080]  you pimp so good why you pimp so good
[01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:36.560]  one time a snoop dog said that to my cousin he goes
[01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:42.480]  yeah well how you pimp so good i can't tell the story but the point is it's a
[01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:46.560]  real story we're sitting here looking at this
[01:35:46.560 --> 01:35:50.720]  and he is unbelievably ridiculous
[01:35:50.720 --> 01:35:57.200]  that henry ford for all his problems they said why did you triple wages
[01:35:57.200 --> 01:36:02.240]  for industrial workers he said well we're up here in dearborn michigan
[01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:09.200]  and if i pay my workers three four times what anybody else is it's still a
[01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:13.200]  fraction of the money i make they will then spend all the money locally
[01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:17.280]  and build up a giant infrastructure that'll bring more workers here
[01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:22.800]  and then they'll be able to afford to buy my automobiles
[01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:29.760]  wow what a smart person he was building
[01:36:30.400 --> 01:36:37.600]  an ecosystem a livable future ecosystem the globalists don't want that they
[01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:42.560]  want to post-industrial world where they oppress the third world and use
[01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:46.560]  his weapons the first so when i shot a video back in october it's a
[01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:50.320]  very important sense of report titled tim cook is the most dangerous man in
[01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:52.880]  the world
[01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:57.520]  i showed you more than 50 mainstream articles
[01:36:57.520 --> 01:37:00.400]  more than 50
[01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:07.360]  where he lobbies for china to be pay less and be more brutal
[01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:10.640]  and the chinese communists are shocked by how vicious he is
[01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:13.520]  but they admire him
[01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:18.800]  so think about that
[01:37:19.520 --> 01:37:23.440]  and i go through all the admissions of how he's promoting censorship in china
[01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:27.120]  censorship in america and and actually lobbying to the u.s government if you
[01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:31.600]  want censorship we're ready to do it so he's a clear and present danger who's
[01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:36.800]  moved to communist china he's doing all this
[01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:42.880]  and it's out of control so i've taken that special video report
[01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:46.800]  and i've added it to paul joseph watson's report about yours truly that's on
[01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:49.600]  info wars dot com
[01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:53.360]  adl the anti-defamation league gives tim cook award
[01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:57.520]  for censoring online speech apple ceo says it's a sin
[01:37:57.520 --> 01:38:04.560]  to not ban certain people a sin apple ceo tim cook received a courage against
[01:38:04.560 --> 01:38:07.280]  hate award from the anti-defamation league
[01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:10.000]  yesterday for censoring online speech including info wars
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:14.960]  alex jones the adl list lists me whom cook referred to as a violent
[01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:18.080]  conspiracy theorist i have no criminal record
[01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:22.160]  i've never called for offensive violence i don't own or run slave camps
[01:38:22.160 --> 01:38:28.480]  i don't have my political enemies rounded up the shot like tim cook does
[01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:32.160]  let's see i sound i have a gravelly voice i have wide shoulders
[01:38:32.160 --> 01:38:37.600]  i've got a 20 inch neck but if i was kind of preening around and
[01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:42.240]  going oh hi i'm tim cook oh yeah
[01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:45.840]  as long as you put on that whole pansy act it's okay
[01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:49.920]  behind the scenes tim cook is not the little pansy hopping around on the
[01:38:49.920 --> 01:38:53.200]  steve jobs outfit all that is for outward consumption
[01:38:53.200 --> 01:38:57.520]  steve jobs children didn't get smartphones or ipads
[01:38:57.520 --> 01:39:01.200]  none of the apple executives none facebook twitter none of them allow their
[01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:06.640]  kids near computers because they lower IQ they destroy you
[01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:10.720]  but in the church of old tim cook
[01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:15.120]  and the full videos are on info wars dot com it's the 30 minute speech
[01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:18.160]  you got the adl spokesperson talking bad about me
[01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:20.480]  you know i'm in the report and they're up there
[01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:26.080]  yay oh we're getting rid of free speech in america hip hip hooray
[01:39:26.080 --> 01:39:30.880]  hip hip hooray and they know they can't call me anti-semitic because no one
[01:39:30.880 --> 01:39:32.880]  buys that and they know they can't call me a
[01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:38.800]  Nazi nobody buys that so they go oh uh he calls for violence
[01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:43.120]  and then they can't produce anything that isn't edited
[01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:48.080]  you know i've been thinking about who to sue for a long time
[01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:51.120]  and i don't like suing people
[01:39:52.240 --> 01:40:00.960]  but man adl can you imagine a jury when they saw the adl giving awards to
[01:40:00.960 --> 01:40:05.360]  arnold's fourth senator who praised hitler
[01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:09.200]  or awards to george soros who funds them who was a nazi collaborator and then
[01:40:09.200 --> 01:40:13.440]  you're sitting there trying to take my free speech and digitally
[01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:18.480]  like jews were put into ghettos where they couldn't do business for five years
[01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:22.080]  before they got rounded up and shipped off to be worked to death and killed
[01:40:22.080 --> 01:40:28.880]  and you're literally trying to put me in what matt drudge coined a digital ghetto
[01:40:28.880 --> 01:40:34.320]  and then using poor dead jews killed by hitler
[01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:38.480]  as the pretext for your organizations cover to then engage in hitler-like
[01:40:38.480 --> 01:40:42.960]  activities how shameful of the adl and by the way
[01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:46.560]  i wish no harm against the adl they're a very sad organization and not one
[01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:48.800]  tent is effective as a southern property law center
[01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:52.000]  that's the big enchilada
[01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:57.280]  the adl is like a seven foot long shark the southern property law center is like
[01:40:57.280 --> 01:41:02.560]  a 200 foot long megalodon or something i mean it's it's just incredibly evil
[01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:06.400]  we've never caught the adl actually running white supremacist terror camps
[01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:08.560]  and blowing up buildings we have caught the southern
[01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:11.600]  property law center involved in it at oklahoma city
[01:41:11.600 --> 01:41:15.040]  we know all the names everybody involved
[01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:20.480]  notice they never challenged that they keep their mouths shut as they should
[01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:24.880]  now oh we almost had a time already i haven't gotten to the clip yet
[01:41:24.880 --> 01:41:28.160]  here let's start hearing some of tim cook talking about
[01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:34.080]  fighting alex jones if you don't do that it's a sin here it is
[01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:39.280]  here because there is very perhaps most importantly
[01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:45.360]  it drives us not to be bystanders bystanders as hate tries to make its
[01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:49.200]  headquarters in the digital world
[01:41:49.200 --> 01:41:53.360]  at apple we believe that technology needs to have a
[01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:56.400]  clear point of view on this challenge
[01:41:56.400 --> 01:42:00.400]  there is no time to get tied up in knots

[01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:45.680]  nazi collaborator who wants to overthrow israel

[01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:17.120]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones
[01:47:17.120 --> 01:47:22.480]  coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[01:47:22.480 --> 01:47:25.840]  do you remember what our headline was yesterday
[01:47:25.840 --> 01:47:29.840]  globalists are engineering a worldwide financial collapse to stop
[01:47:29.840 --> 01:47:34.960]  populist and nationalist movements and right now the dow is going between
[01:47:34.960 --> 01:47:40.240]  800 and 750 points down drudgereport.com
[01:47:40.240 --> 01:47:45.520]  it's also on news wars.com fears of slowing economy and what happened
[01:47:45.520 --> 01:47:50.080]  well trump bet on america he knew china had 10 growth rates for decades we had
[01:47:50.080 --> 01:47:52.880]  2 growth rates the leftist said we'd never get
[01:47:52.880 --> 01:47:56.080]  above 3 at the new york times paul kregman
[01:47:56.080 --> 01:48:00.000]  trump came in got some of the regulations off got some of the tax cuts
[01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:03.840]  going and wall street and the investors believe they could
[01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:07.760]  come back to america and then the federal reserve
[01:48:07.760 --> 01:48:12.080]  private run for profit did seven interest rate hikes
[01:48:12.080 --> 01:48:15.760]  and announced at least five more in the next year and said we believe the
[01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:20.000]  economy is going to implode never did that under obama
[01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:24.880]  all to stop trump all to stop the nationalist movements
[01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:30.400]  they admit bill marr admits it hillary clinton's talked about it
[01:48:30.400 --> 01:48:34.080]  they think you're so stupid that if they take this recovery away from you
[01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:37.520]  and take your 401k up 30 40 percent a year away
[01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:41.760]  and and and take your future away that you'll blame trump and you know what the
[01:48:41.760 --> 01:48:46.240]  general public probably will they're that stupid now
[01:48:46.240 --> 01:48:51.680]  and so what they signified was
[01:48:51.680 --> 01:48:54.480]  trump went to war with the chai comms what a one-sided deal
[01:48:54.480 --> 01:48:58.160]  he only wanted to get a third of the screw over back
[01:48:58.160 --> 01:49:02.000]  he said listen you can keep 70 percent of the screw job give me 30 percent
[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:06.160]  they said no he said now it's 50 percent they said no now he said it's 80
[01:49:06.160 --> 01:49:10.800]  percent now they've agreed to about 30 40 percent
[01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:14.880]  but they're trying to back out of that that's why trumps like i'm sick of this
[01:49:14.880 --> 01:49:18.240]  crap we built you we gave you running water we gave
[01:49:18.240 --> 01:49:21.440]  you everything you have after the japanese tried to destroy you
[01:49:21.440 --> 01:49:25.520]  and and and now you've got one-sided deal screwing us over
[01:49:25.520 --> 01:49:28.560]  you got all our companies moving over there becoming state run
[01:49:28.560 --> 01:49:32.160]  you want to have a market soon in the u.s the chinese go we know we're taking
[01:49:32.160 --> 01:49:35.120]  you over you know they own hollywood now
[01:49:35.120 --> 01:49:38.640]  they're the ones that fund all the anti-family anti you know teach five
[01:49:38.640 --> 01:49:42.720]  year olds how to put on dresses that's all chai comm funding
[01:49:42.720 --> 01:49:48.160]  they admit it they execute you for that in china they don't allow that in china
[01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:54.880]  but they're doing it here to poison us and tim cook and all of them are just
[01:49:54.880 --> 01:49:58.240]  fine and dandy with that so let's let's punch up the
[01:49:58.240 --> 01:50:03.280]  dial right now for folks on screen so all of this is happening
[01:50:03.280 --> 01:50:09.360]  because the world signaled we don't want a vibrant stock market
[01:50:09.360 --> 01:50:13.200]  we don't want factories we don't want jobs we don't want families
[01:50:13.200 --> 01:50:17.360]  we want a post-industrial world we don't want somebody in two years that turn
[01:50:17.360 --> 01:50:22.560]  the economy around 50 60 70 percent we don't and i don't want to compare
[01:50:22.560 --> 01:50:25.920]  trump to christ but it's the comparison is
[01:50:25.920 --> 01:50:28.640]  it's a true story it's in the roman histories the jewish histories
[01:50:28.640 --> 01:50:32.400]  jocephus the jewish historian wrote about it
[01:50:34.240 --> 01:50:36.960]  christ gets brought up there he has done nothing wrong
[01:50:36.960 --> 01:50:40.320]  conscious pilot here's what he's done and he says okay well it's a holy day of
[01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:44.000]  the jewish i will let one person go today who's
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:47.120]  scheduled to be executed and there's two people scheduled to be executed
[01:50:47.120 --> 01:50:52.720]  today uh jesus of nazareth and
[01:50:52.720 --> 01:50:58.720]  barabas of jerusalem and barabas was a robber and a
[01:50:58.720 --> 01:51:04.960]  rapist and a killer and a tough guy and they said give us barabas
[01:51:04.960 --> 01:51:09.280]  and so we've got trump good economy cares about the country
[01:51:09.280 --> 01:51:12.960]  trying to get all this blocked technologies released all the
[01:51:12.960 --> 01:51:16.080]  cures and treatments all the good things he's trying to do he's not perfect
[01:51:16.080 --> 01:51:18.560]  he's certainly not christ but it's the same thing they go
[01:51:18.560 --> 01:51:23.280]  we don't want that give us hillary give us michael more
[01:51:23.280 --> 01:51:27.200]  give us nancy polosi give us maxine waters give us
[01:51:27.200 --> 01:51:32.480]  angela merkel give us teresa may give us treason don't give us latimer
[01:51:32.480 --> 01:51:36.320]  putin who stands up for his country don't give us benjamin yahu
[01:51:36.320 --> 01:51:38.560]  stands up for his country don't give us donald
[01:51:38.560 --> 01:51:43.280]  drop that stands up for his country don't give us the new italian leader
[01:51:43.280 --> 01:51:46.320]  or the new brazilian leader that stands up for his country
[01:51:46.320 --> 01:51:51.600]  give us what the mainstream media wants that'll screw us over
[01:51:51.600 --> 01:51:56.800]  and for bill marr i want the economy to implode to get rid of this guy
[01:51:56.800 --> 01:52:00.080]  they did everything they could to block it and now they're doing everything they
[01:52:00.080 --> 01:52:03.920]  can to block u.s companies coming back to the u.s
[01:52:03.920 --> 01:52:07.280]  and even though general motors got bailed out 10 years ago and even though
[01:52:07.280 --> 01:52:10.160]  general motors made record profits and even though general motors just bought
[01:52:10.160 --> 01:52:15.280]  back hundreds of billions of dollars in the last few years their own stock
[01:52:15.280 --> 01:52:20.160]  they're closing five factories in a place where trump promises to stay open
[01:52:20.160 --> 01:52:24.080]  thinking those voters are so stupid they'll be pissed that he couldn't keep it
[01:52:24.080 --> 01:52:32.560]  open for him
[01:52:32.560 --> 01:52:36.640]  now let's go back to the numbers it's already been gyrating up and down
[01:52:36.640 --> 01:52:40.960]  so so let's go it's 600 points down it's 721 points down
[01:52:40.960 --> 01:52:46.400]  it's 800 points down it's 750 points down it's all over the map like a ping
[01:52:46.400 --> 01:52:53.040]  pong ball shot out of a cannon but know this
[01:52:53.040 --> 01:52:56.000]  big corporations and companies on average aren't evil
[01:52:56.000 --> 01:53:00.320]  it's the top 50 or so that are but there are so much economy is a bunch of
[01:53:00.320 --> 01:53:03.920]  other companies they want to go where business is going to be open
[01:53:03.920 --> 01:53:08.320]  and where they're going to have a fair shot and trump got in and we were open
[01:53:08.320 --> 01:53:12.160]  for business and they thought yeah we'll have exuberance we'll have jobs
[01:53:12.160 --> 01:53:16.400]  america hadn't had a boom since the 60s we can do it again
[01:53:16.400 --> 01:53:21.760]  and the globalist said that's not part of the program jack
[01:53:21.760 --> 01:53:24.720]  that's not going to happen
[01:53:25.760 --> 01:53:29.040]  and you see trump just walking off the stage he's like just get me out of here
[01:53:29.040 --> 01:53:33.040]  yesterday and i can tell you trump's
[01:53:33.040 --> 01:53:38.240]  going to keep fighting but he can't believe
[01:53:39.920 --> 01:53:43.200]  it'd be like if you went to a restaurant for 20 years and the food was always
[01:53:43.200 --> 01:53:47.760]  quick delicious and healthy but you went to a place across the
[01:53:47.760 --> 01:53:50.720]  street got food poisoning there routinely and the food tastes like crap
[01:53:50.720 --> 01:53:53.840]  and then you said you know what i don't want your restaurant
[01:53:53.840 --> 01:53:58.640]  that's good and healthy and tasty to be here i want you closed and no one goes
[01:53:58.640 --> 01:54:02.000]  to the good restaurant they all go to the place with roach crap on the tables
[01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:05.920]  and roach is walking around in broad daylight and you get food poisoning
[01:54:05.920 --> 01:54:08.720]  and everyone goes to the place with food poisoning
[01:54:08.720 --> 01:54:11.680]  and they love the place with food poisoning they love venezuela they love
[01:54:11.680 --> 01:54:15.440]  north korea they love the e you they love democrat blue states with needles
[01:54:15.440 --> 01:54:19.360]  and human feces and teaching five-year-olds how to get blowjobs
[01:54:19.360 --> 01:54:26.000]  i mean this is what uh i mean this is what cursed people want
[01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:29.840]  they don't want jesus christ they want barabas
[01:54:29.840 --> 01:54:36.560]  give us barabas give us a screwjob give us tim cook running slave factories
[01:54:36.560 --> 01:54:40.160]  because he's gay though it's cool it's like well he is gay so i mean well
[01:54:40.160 --> 01:54:44.160]  oh okay well then you know i can tell you how many times i have left this walk
[01:54:44.160 --> 01:54:47.200]  up to me like it's like they're wearing a royal purple coat they go
[01:54:47.200 --> 01:54:50.080]  we're gay
[01:54:51.200 --> 01:54:56.720]  and i'm like well i i can't even talk at that point i don't care if you're gay
[01:54:56.720 --> 01:54:59.920]  if you're straight whatever the hell you are i care about what you stand for
[01:54:59.920 --> 01:55:03.440]  but the fact that you announce it like it's a royal coat or something
[01:55:03.440 --> 01:55:08.080]  is pathetic but it's all these identity politics
[01:55:08.080 --> 01:55:11.760]  that you claim trumps involved in when trumps in the opposite of identity
[01:55:11.760 --> 01:55:14.240]  politics
[01:55:14.240 --> 01:55:18.640]  he's unifying you about free market and things that work and
[01:55:18.640 --> 01:55:22.160]  he thought you'd want it and you know what you did want
[01:55:22.160 --> 01:55:26.880]  the republicans really got elected the democrats stole it but because the
[01:55:26.880 --> 01:55:30.960]  republicans wouldn't say that and because the republicans wouldn't
[01:55:30.960 --> 01:55:33.760]  fight back and because the republicans have allowed the censorship
[01:55:33.760 --> 01:55:37.120]  they have signal weakness
[01:55:37.840 --> 01:55:40.960]  they have signal weakness so you might get a total stock market crash for
[01:55:40.960 --> 01:55:44.480]  christmas i'm not saying that's going to happen but if the plunge protection
[01:55:44.480 --> 01:55:49.440]  team wasn't in there the committee on open markets that would happen right now
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:55.440]  and i'm going to stop right here i'm going to go to break and come back

[02:00:48.240 --> 02:00:53.200]  eyes and funded by leftist NGOs the migrant caravan was formed in the
[02:00:53.200 --> 02:00:57.120]  violent city of san pedrosula a city in northern
[02:00:57.120 --> 02:01:02.320]  honduras and began heading north in mid october
[02:01:02.320 --> 02:01:06.640]  from the very beginning the intentions of the so-called migrant caravan were
[02:01:06.640 --> 02:01:10.160]  clear their plans were to reach the us border
[02:01:10.160 --> 02:01:14.880]  and cross illegally when they reached the mexican border
[02:01:14.880 --> 02:01:19.200]  the border gates were not open for them they violently broke through them
[02:01:19.200 --> 02:01:24.320]  anyway and the guatemalan police stood back and watched
[02:01:24.320 --> 02:01:28.560]  in mid november they reached the us border in tuana mexico
[02:01:28.560 --> 02:01:33.840]  and showing no respect for us law they immediately began scaling the border
[02:01:33.840 --> 02:01:39.680]  fence and on sunday november 25th the caravan
[02:01:39.680 --> 02:01:43.200]  made a run for the border in an organized assault
[02:01:43.200 --> 02:01:46.240]  they went through the canal and violently pushed through the local
[02:01:46.240 --> 02:01:51.520]  mexican authorities dragging children along with them
[02:01:51.520 --> 02:01:54.720]  they did not show any respect for the laws of the us
[02:01:54.720 --> 02:01:59.280]  or mexico instead they tried to force their way through the
[02:01:59.280 --> 02:02:04.160]  border fence before being repelled by tear gas
[02:02:04.160 --> 02:02:08.480]  president trump temporarily closed the border at san asidro
[02:02:08.480 --> 02:02:12.320]  sending a message to the t-wana government which has always relied on the
[02:02:12.320 --> 02:02:18.640]  crossing for its tourist economy the message seemed to have gotten through
[02:02:18.640 --> 02:02:24.160]  t-wana mayor Juan Manuel Gastloom evicted the migrant caravan from their
[02:02:24.160 --> 02:02:27.440]  encampment right on the us border and began
[02:02:27.440 --> 02:02:31.360]  busing them all to an area about 30 minutes south of the border
[02:02:31.360 --> 02:02:38.000]  in the mariano matamoros area the organizers of the caravan were furious
[02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:42.160]  they wanted to be on the border to pressure the us
[02:02:42.160 --> 02:02:46.080]  far left extremist group by any means necessary
[02:02:46.080 --> 02:02:49.760]  failed in their attempt to coerce the migrants into making a second attempt
[02:02:49.760 --> 02:02:54.960]  at taking the border and on saturday after getting sworn in
[02:02:54.960 --> 02:02:58.320]  newly elected president andres manuel lopez
[02:02:58.320 --> 02:03:01.440]  overdore signed an agreement with el salvador
[02:03:01.440 --> 02:03:06.800]  Guatemala and Honduras to create a development plan to lessen the poverty
[02:03:06.800 --> 02:03:12.080]  that drives people to leave it seems as if the united nation's replacement
[02:03:12.080 --> 02:03:17.520]  migration agenda has been stopped in its tracks at the us southern border
[02:03:17.520 --> 02:03:22.720]  and as the united nation seeks to ratify an international open borders policy
[02:03:22.720 --> 02:03:26.960]  dozens of countries have already declined president trump's
[02:03:26.960 --> 02:03:30.720]  america first agenda is spreading to other countries
[02:03:30.720 --> 02:03:34.720]  world leaders across the globe are learning that world peace
[02:03:34.720 --> 02:03:40.000]  begins at home and if california is the testing ground for what the new left is
[02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:43.040]  hoping to implement throughout the rest of the country
[02:03:43.040 --> 02:03:49.120]  torn and frayed burned to the ground and falling into darkness then we
[02:03:49.120 --> 02:03:52.000]  certainly have our work cut out for us here at home
[02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:55.760]  before we can start trying to save the rest of the world
[02:03:55.760 --> 02:04:01.200]  this is greg reese for news wars dot zero hedge reported a recent study
[02:04:01.200 --> 02:04:04.880]  concluded that only two percent of the population needs to have done
[02:04:04.880 --> 02:04:10.160]  a dna test for virtually everyone's genetic makeup to be exposed and that
[02:04:10.160 --> 02:04:13.440]  exposure opens the door to the ultimate breach of privacy
[02:04:13.440 --> 02:04:17.760]  a breach that will germinate the seed constructing a prison planet system
[02:04:17.760 --> 02:04:20.640]  nanny state that would even horrify george orwell
[02:04:20.640 --> 02:04:24.400]  bloomberg reported currently law enforcement already has potential

[02:04:40.800 --> 02:04:45.040]  the new york times wrote currently all 50 states are either compliant or have

[02:04:47.840 --> 02:04:51.600]  alternative identification there are 28 states that are now

[02:06:53.760 --> 02:06:57.040]  ron paul one in his congressional office
[02:06:57.040 --> 02:07:01.760]  oathkeepers dot org and he's been all over the u.s all over our borders
[02:07:01.760 --> 02:07:05.680]  who could have believed when ron paul was talking about this 30 years ago i was
[02:07:05.680 --> 02:07:08.800]  talking about 25 years ago you were talking about 15 years ago 20 years ago
[02:07:08.800 --> 02:07:12.880]  that now world government total censorship the democrats
[02:07:12.880 --> 02:07:16.160]  allied with the chai comms that all of it would be so
[02:07:16.160 --> 02:07:21.040]  incredibly naked and in our face and then when those of us that were right
[02:07:21.040 --> 02:07:25.440]  about all this are proven right instead we all get censored
[02:07:25.440 --> 02:07:29.840]  we don't get carried around on folks's shoulders which i'm not calling for
[02:07:29.840 --> 02:07:34.240]  the general public appreciates what we've done but now steward it's so much
[02:07:34.240 --> 02:07:38.960]  clear i mean you're a constitutional lawyer uh you're a former army
[02:07:38.960 --> 02:07:41.680]  a paratrooper i mean you've been around the world you've seen a lot
[02:07:41.680 --> 02:07:44.000]  historically before we get into what's happening with the border and these
[02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:48.320]  migrant invasions and the rest of it what would you call this time in history
[02:07:48.320 --> 02:07:52.960]  uh i think i would call it the battle between the people and the globalists
[02:07:52.960 --> 02:07:57.680]  i mean look what's going on in france it's a worldwide assault on
[02:07:57.680 --> 02:08:00.720]  average people in the working class that's what's ironic
[02:08:00.720 --> 02:08:04.400]  is a left ban in the working class long ago and aligned with with globalists
[02:08:04.400 --> 02:08:09.120]  that trash economies and and got vampires on on a global economy
[02:08:09.120 --> 02:08:12.560]  among among nations by the way we'll run some b-roll for tv viewers the
[02:08:12.560 --> 02:08:17.680]  background of the image of people commandeering a huge
[02:08:17.680 --> 02:08:21.280]  cranes and then throwing police cars into burning
[02:08:21.280 --> 02:08:24.320]  checkpoints i mean these are like some scenes from hell
[02:08:24.320 --> 02:08:27.920]  well you're seeing what's turning into a civil war in france basically you've
[02:08:27.920 --> 02:08:31.280]  got the french people finally waking up to the reality that their
[02:08:31.280 --> 02:08:34.960]  globalist leaders have sold them out and want to destroy their nation and
[02:08:34.960 --> 02:08:37.600]  they're they're acting like nationalists acting like people that
[02:08:37.600 --> 02:08:41.760]  want to preserve their way of life you know the good news too is that
[02:08:41.760 --> 02:08:46.160]  macron the the literal Rothschild sex toy when he was 13 years old
[02:08:46.160 --> 02:08:49.760]  he has now backed off for six months on the new
[02:08:49.760 --> 02:08:53.920]  carbon tax well he's backing off just as long enough to throw the folks back to
[02:08:53.920 --> 02:08:57.040]  sleep again and then they'll be back again so this is the problem we face in
[02:08:57.040 --> 02:09:01.200]  our own country too it's this you know the salt from both sides of the aisle
[02:09:01.200 --> 02:09:06.000]  it's the it's the establishments the deep state in every nation
[02:09:07.360 --> 02:09:10.880]  i would call this world war four because i agree with the
[02:09:10.880 --> 02:09:14.400]  folks that study these things that the cold war was world war three
[02:09:14.400 --> 02:09:18.160]  and now world war four is a new type of war it's on every front you're an
[02:09:18.160 --> 02:09:21.040]  expert on that you've spoken to that i mean let's talk about who the players
[02:09:21.040 --> 02:09:24.960]  are in this fight who the globalist are versus who the nations are and it's so
[02:09:24.960 --> 02:09:27.600]  clear they've been exploiting the third world now they're using it as a weapon
[02:09:27.600 --> 02:09:31.200]  oh completely we saw that in europe for for the last two decades and we're
[02:09:31.200 --> 02:09:34.080]  seeing it in united states as well it's been going on for a long time
[02:09:34.080 --> 02:09:36.640]  so it's kind of frustrating about the whole caravan issue is that's just
[02:09:36.640 --> 02:09:41.520]  simply the latest tactic or assault and an ongoing war on the west to flood us
[02:09:41.520 --> 02:09:44.560]  with third third world people and and then you know
[02:09:44.560 --> 02:09:48.080]  overwhelm us and and kill our kill our countries it's happening in europe it's
[02:09:48.080 --> 02:09:51.280]  happening here in the united states it's the war on the rest on the west
[02:09:51.280 --> 02:09:54.640]  and it's so obvious when that when they're waving foreign flags screaming
[02:09:54.640 --> 02:09:57.600]  down with america yeah you got hondurans waving the
[02:09:57.600 --> 02:10:00.080]  honduran flag burning the us flag like you've had you know
[02:10:00.080 --> 02:10:02.480]  mexican people weren't waving the mexican flag
[02:10:02.480 --> 02:10:06.080]  and burning the us flag that's not who we want here and they know it
[02:10:06.080 --> 02:10:08.560]  and they don't care and you have the leftists and you know chanting in the
[02:10:08.560 --> 02:10:12.720]  streets no border no wall no usa at all they're telling you exactly what their
[02:10:12.720 --> 02:10:17.360]  agenda is which is to destroy this country destroy the west
[02:10:18.560 --> 02:10:21.680]  i want to get specifically the border operations i want you guys been witnessing
[02:10:21.680 --> 02:10:24.960]  some of the great ranchers you've got uh here in the gremarin in fact if they
[02:10:24.960 --> 02:10:27.680]  ever want to pop in in the studio in there i'd love to have mods that
[02:10:27.680 --> 02:10:29.360]  opportunities there if they want to do it roads
[02:10:29.360 --> 02:10:33.040]  founder of keepers is here but the few minutes we have left before break before
[02:10:33.040 --> 02:10:37.520]  we get into that again what is it like to be politically
[02:10:37.520 --> 02:10:42.320]  active for i don't know more than 15 years and to see our movement
[02:10:42.320 --> 02:10:45.680]  really being extremely fringe now being mainstream globally
[02:10:45.680 --> 02:10:50.400]  nationalist being elected everywhere but then seeing the globalist counter strike
[02:10:50.400 --> 02:10:55.440]  of open censorship openly allied with yonker and the eu and the chikoms
[02:10:55.440 --> 02:10:58.400]  to me it's it's a good feeling to see how far we've come
[02:10:58.400 --> 02:11:02.080]  but as the real war started now it makes me upset because
[02:11:02.080 --> 02:11:05.600]  they have national polls one fifth of americans say ban the american flag
[02:11:05.600 --> 02:11:09.600]  they really hate the country these battle lines are so clear
[02:11:09.600 --> 02:11:12.640]  i wouldn't think that you'd have such a large percentage of people siding with
[02:11:12.640 --> 02:11:15.360]  the globalist and against their own self-interest well they've been
[02:11:15.360 --> 02:11:18.160]  indoctrinated in the high schools and look at the nea
[02:11:18.160 --> 02:11:22.480]  this is last plank from the nea about what they called
[02:11:22.480 --> 02:11:25.760]  totalitarian or white supremacist culture if they want to stamp out
[02:11:25.760 --> 02:11:29.280]  so they've been indoctrinating the kids in high school and in colleges now
[02:11:29.280 --> 02:11:32.240]  for generations it's my all my kids are homeschooled
[02:11:32.240 --> 02:11:35.920]  so i'm not surprised at all i mean i went to Yale law school i saw the
[02:11:35.920 --> 02:11:39.600]  brainwashing was going on at Yale and at the highest levels they brainwashed
[02:11:39.600 --> 02:11:42.400]  these kids into communism so they teach them to hate the
[02:11:42.400 --> 02:11:45.600]  united states and hate their own country and this is what's been done by the
[02:11:45.600 --> 02:11:48.880]  left since since the 17s or 60s actually is they
[02:11:48.880 --> 02:11:52.000]  especially want to focus on blacks and Hispanics trying to get them to believe
[02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.880]  that this country is inherently racist and oppressive
[02:11:54.880 --> 02:11:58.080]  and to hate their own country but it's among also young whites too
[02:11:58.080 --> 02:12:01.040]  so i'm not surprised at all you have a lot of useful idiots out there that
[02:12:01.040 --> 02:12:03.520]  have been indoctrinated to hate their own country well
[02:12:03.520 --> 02:12:07.520]  this is just today stanford's telling fraternities take down the american flag
[02:12:07.520 --> 02:12:11.600]  it gives us a bad image this is literally what a foreign enemy does it says
[02:12:11.600 --> 02:12:18.800]  take down your flag you suck in the in the fictitious uh fictional 1980s movie
[02:12:18.800 --> 02:12:21.440]  red dawn they're in a sports stadium model after real
[02:12:21.440 --> 02:12:24.800]  soviet sports stadiums that did this saying america's a pig sty george
[02:12:24.800 --> 02:12:30.000]  washington sucked guns or your guns or it sounds like msnbc
[02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:33.600]  the fictional brainwashing camp is now on television
[02:12:33.600 --> 02:12:36.000]  well it's what they're in your in your face which is kind of good like you said
[02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.960]  before now the masses coming off they're revealing themselves what they really
[02:12:38.960 --> 02:12:42.240]  are which is communist it's communist versus freedom that's what it's
[02:12:42.240 --> 02:12:46.000]  pulling down to and of course being being being manipulated by the globalist
[02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.880]  who are neither one they're neither communist nor are they free they're
[02:12:48.880 --> 02:12:52.560]  just global dictators they use but they use the useful idiots on the left in
[02:12:52.560 --> 02:12:58.640]  this country as a weapon gut level i think intellectually
[02:12:58.640 --> 02:13:01.440]  spiritually we're turning the tide we're waking up we're starting to have
[02:13:01.440 --> 02:13:05.520]  some big wins but the counter offensive of the globalist is so over
[02:13:05.520 --> 02:13:09.680]  the top i think if we don't recognize that this is the real assault and really
[02:13:09.680 --> 02:13:13.200]  don't take this serious like you said wake up we're going to lose
[02:13:13.200 --> 02:13:17.520]  um well we'll be in a fight it'll it'll turn into a kinetic fight
[02:13:17.520 --> 02:13:21.040]  the only way to win without that kinetic fight we have a narrow window of
[02:13:21.040 --> 02:13:25.520]  opportunity right now to turn things around without having to use force
[02:13:25.520 --> 02:13:28.160]  but i don't understand that i i'm simply saying
[02:13:28.160 --> 02:13:31.840]  if you're hit by something that is cultural
[02:13:31.840 --> 02:13:36.720]  societal genocidal ending you if you don't recognize
[02:13:36.720 --> 02:13:40.000]  that this is a full assault then you'll be destroyed i'm simply saying we must
[02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:43.120]  recognize the magnitude oh yeah absolutely and it's too
[02:13:43.120 --> 02:13:46.560]  much apathy right now also i call it the trump apathy effect
[02:13:46.560 --> 02:13:49.760]  there's too many on the right have gone to sleep because trump was elected like
[02:13:49.760 --> 02:13:53.680]  well we won the war and it's just this one battle and they're not doing enough
[02:13:53.680 --> 02:13:56.560]  that's what's frustrating for me it's just why we're now going down the
[02:13:56.560 --> 02:14:00.480]  border we feel a need a duty to call attention to what's
[02:14:00.480 --> 02:14:04.400]  happening and to push for more it's not enough what president
[02:14:04.400 --> 02:14:07.520]  trump has done he's done some good work but the military deployment to the
[02:14:07.520 --> 02:14:10.880]  border is simply in the in the major crossing areas and
[02:14:10.880 --> 02:14:14.000]  it's only a support function it's not enough he needs to deploy the full u.s
[02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:17.040]  military on the border that's what's necessary because if he doesn't do that
[02:14:17.040 --> 02:14:21.440]  we'll be swamped as the as the intent is and the democrats will gain a
[02:14:21.440 --> 02:14:24.720]  illegitimate permanent block of political power well that's right and the
[02:14:24.720 --> 02:14:27.680]  left then acts like we're advocating martial law no
[02:14:27.680 --> 02:14:31.360]  having the you intake of our police like obama called four strong cities that's
[02:14:31.360 --> 02:14:34.160]  martial law having military on your border when
[02:14:34.160 --> 02:14:38.000]  it's under attack is called the default constitutional position
[02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:41.120]  right well will drew Wilson did this back when poncho via rated across the
[02:14:41.120 --> 02:14:44.080]  border and killed killed american citizens he deployed the u.s military
[02:14:44.080 --> 02:14:46.960]  the full u.s army on the border and then senate expedition
[02:14:46.960 --> 02:14:51.040]  opinionary expedition into mexico to track down poncho via
[02:14:51.040 --> 02:14:54.400]  so you know the one of the patron saints of the globalist is woodrow wilson
[02:14:54.400 --> 02:14:57.760]  he did this so that's precedent right there from
[02:14:57.760 --> 02:15:00.720]  about a hundred years ago for the president to take ash and defend the
[02:15:00.720 --> 02:15:03.920]  country it's completely constitutional but from the time of Rome or any other
[02:15:03.920 --> 02:15:07.440]  than that system the militaries are for the border
[02:15:07.440 --> 02:15:10.560]  sure national defense if you don't have a border you haven't got a country
[02:15:10.560 --> 02:15:14.880]  absolutely so he could he could even deploy troops into mexico
[02:15:14.880 --> 02:15:19.600]  as wilson did to go in and hit them before they get to the border
[02:15:19.600 --> 02:15:22.400]  well even before wilson back when mexico went all the way up into
[02:15:22.400 --> 02:15:26.880]  and into oklahoma and even some areas of colorado killing miners and people
[02:15:26.880 --> 02:15:30.080]  the united states is where the marines have the from the halls of montezuma
[02:15:30.080 --> 02:15:33.200]  to the shores of triple e right i mean the marines have gone down to mexico
[02:15:33.200 --> 02:15:37.040]  city too you bet absolutely and we're not calling for that we're just
[02:15:37.040 --> 02:15:40.960]  saying if mexico and other people let their southern border open and do this
[02:15:40.960 --> 02:15:44.080]  as a military attack we'll have to go down and take their government over to
[02:15:44.080 --> 02:15:47.360]  stop it peck trumps even said venezuela that's what's causing the whole
[02:15:47.360 --> 02:15:50.160]  collapse northward we've got to do something about that we'll be right

[02:20:37.120 --> 02:20:40.080]  to go there and spread the links and support them because they've proven
[02:20:40.080 --> 02:20:42.800]  themselves over the decades to be a great patriot organization
[02:20:42.800 --> 02:20:46.720]  steward rhodes is an army veteran of course he's one of ron paul's
[02:20:46.720 --> 02:20:50.880]  main advisors he's an award-winning constitutional lawyer trained in yale
[02:20:50.880 --> 02:20:53.040]  which really showed him how the establishment operates we'll talk about
[02:20:53.040 --> 02:20:56.480]  skull and bones and poppy being buried tomorrow a little bit later in the
[02:20:56.480 --> 02:21:00.160]  broadcast uh but but first we're on the same page I
[02:21:00.160 --> 02:21:02.480]  walked in here and I said what needs to be done
[02:21:02.480 --> 02:21:06.000]  and you said prosecutions well I had just told them
[02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:09.200]  I'm going to ask steward where he wants to go but I bet he says
[02:21:09.200 --> 02:21:13.360]  prosecutions queue up the mayor of tijuana saying charge these people
[02:21:13.360 --> 02:21:15.920]  yeah a lot of these are kidnapped kids and you know
[02:21:15.920 --> 02:21:19.680]  what threatens soros and the u and in the globalist when you see when they get
[02:21:19.680 --> 02:21:24.480]  most upset remember a month ago ludob says the head of judicial watch on
[02:21:24.480 --> 02:21:28.240]  there's also a lawyer and he he's gotten documents proving soros is getting
[02:21:28.240 --> 02:21:31.680]  taxpayer money to do it well soros is on the news bragging about it too it's not
[02:21:31.680 --> 02:21:34.720]  like it's a damn secret but he has the documents
[02:21:34.720 --> 02:21:39.440]  they call for dobs be fired boycott start and news corps says
[02:21:39.440 --> 02:21:43.200]  the head of judicial watch is now banned totally respected
[02:21:43.200 --> 02:21:47.360]  so it wasn't because they were lying the news all said fake news but wouldn't
[02:21:47.360 --> 02:21:52.560]  say what ludob said it's what steward roses said so
[02:21:52.560 --> 02:21:56.480]  again anybody can search engine a band ludob's
[02:21:56.480 --> 02:21:59.600]  interview on the caravan it's on info wars.com
[02:21:59.600 --> 02:22:03.360]  but but steward your constitutional lawyer I mean yes get on the border
[02:22:03.360 --> 02:22:06.000]  more troops I taught you you're going to give us your assessment in the next
[02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:09.760]  segment your report card being all over the 2000 plus miles via
[02:22:09.760 --> 02:22:13.040]  aircraft on the ground over the years just got in california now here in
[02:22:13.040 --> 02:22:15.760]  texas but we'll get your report card on
[02:22:15.760 --> 02:22:18.800]  currently trying to put a tourniquet on the leg instead of not letting him chop
[02:22:18.800 --> 02:22:21.920]  the leg off to begin with what do we need to do
[02:22:21.920 --> 02:22:26.560]  prosecutions there is a clear federal statute that criminalizes its felony
[02:22:26.560 --> 02:22:30.400]  to aid and abat illegal aliens coming into the united states
[02:22:30.400 --> 02:22:34.160]  and so you've got bald in your face violation of federal law that should be
[02:22:34.160 --> 02:22:37.360]  prosecuted there should be a doj doj indictments and
[02:22:37.360 --> 02:22:41.280]  grand juries being convened for the politicians in california for soros
[02:22:41.280 --> 02:22:44.400]  for all these NGOs that are that are assisting these legal
[02:22:44.400 --> 02:22:47.200]  aliens coming to united states and encouraging them that's itting and
[02:22:47.200 --> 02:22:50.160]  abetting same with sanctuary cities and sanctuary states
[02:22:50.160 --> 02:22:55.520]  same thing if i shut up an NGO and tried to smuggle kids in i'd be put
[02:22:55.520 --> 02:22:58.800]  under the jail and i should be and they admit that a lot of these kids smuggled
[02:22:58.800 --> 02:23:02.560]  in under obama wouldn't get checked and were it were sex traded that's even in
[02:23:02.560 --> 02:23:07.760]  the washington post new york times so exactly how the hell is this happening
[02:23:07.760 --> 02:23:10.960]  it's the same problem we've seen over the years i mean i don't understand why
[02:23:10.960 --> 02:23:14.960]  the doj under under trump is not prosecuting he needs to clean the deep
[02:23:14.960 --> 02:23:17.840]  state out first in his doj and begin the
[02:23:17.840 --> 02:23:21.040]  prosecutions that's where he has to start first otherwise he can't clean
[02:23:21.040 --> 02:23:24.160]  anything else out they're there they believe they're untouchable
[02:23:24.160 --> 02:23:28.640]  they can do what they want and get away with it and so far they're right
[02:23:28.640 --> 02:23:31.200]  and again people say well trump better do something
[02:23:31.200 --> 02:23:34.240]  it's all these liberal judges are the ones that say he can't ban people from
[02:23:34.240 --> 02:23:36.160]  six countries when it's right in the constitution
[02:23:36.160 --> 02:23:39.600]  they're the ones suing him right now saying he couldn't block the caravan
[02:23:39.600 --> 02:23:42.640]  he just ignored that right that's what he should do he should
[02:23:42.640 --> 02:23:45.760]  eventually just say look the judges can you know kind of what uh
[02:23:45.760 --> 02:23:49.840]  what you had uh andrew say right andrew jackson that's right and jackson said
[02:23:49.840 --> 02:23:52.640]  we'll let them enforce it you know he has to protect the country
[02:23:52.640 --> 02:23:56.320]  um but he should be prosecuting i think the governor of california for one
[02:23:56.320 --> 02:23:59.760]  um the mayors that are doing the sanctuary cities be prosecuted and start
[02:23:59.760 --> 02:24:03.360]  there put them under indictment and so the people can see and if they still if
[02:24:03.360 --> 02:24:06.720]  the judge has dismissed the the cases then you then you know exactly what's
[02:24:06.720 --> 02:24:10.400]  happening and you realize you're dealing with a judicial uh tyranny in this
[02:24:10.400 --> 02:24:12.720]  country
[02:24:13.360 --> 02:24:17.440]  force them to do that force them to dismiss the uh the um charges
[02:24:17.440 --> 02:24:20.560]  force the judges to show their true face well every time it gets to the supreme
[02:24:20.560 --> 02:24:24.160]  court they go nine to zero for trump because he follows exactly the letter
[02:24:24.160 --> 02:24:26.000]  of the law that's the good thing about trump is
[02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:29.920]  he literally just goes off it right and that's the one acing up his sleeve on
[02:24:29.920 --> 02:24:33.360]  the courts he can take it to the supreme court and they can he can crush down
[02:24:33.360 --> 02:24:37.520]  the uh the lower court but again when the night circuit and these democrat
[02:24:37.520 --> 02:24:41.040]  congress people are in california saying everyone come here come here we're
[02:24:41.040 --> 02:24:44.160]  not going to check you and there's smuggled kids and drugs
[02:24:44.160 --> 02:24:48.160]  again like that they had a hillary foundation group
[02:24:48.160 --> 02:24:51.600]  got caught smuggling little little kids out of Haiti she went to jail
[02:24:51.600 --> 02:24:57.200]  like suddenly ah it's crazy man so he has to start indictments um he has to
[02:24:57.200 --> 02:25:00.640]  start pushing back against them because otherwise they have no fear and we have
[02:25:00.640 --> 02:25:03.920]  to support him in doing that and then then after that we'll see how it goes
[02:25:03.920 --> 02:25:08.080]  could be uncharted territory or at least not since the last civil war
[02:25:08.080 --> 02:25:11.120]  well i don't want to get into it on air because smart folks have told me it was
[02:25:11.120 --> 02:25:14.400]  probably not the best time to do it but i've actually had Mueller literally try
[02:25:14.400 --> 02:25:17.680]  to set me up i mean i've had them come out for me and they're coming out for
[02:25:17.680 --> 02:25:19.920]  everybody i mean they are really threatening i mean i know they've
[02:25:19.920 --> 02:25:24.000]  probably messed with you a lot too it's just it's crazy expected yeah
[02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:30.560]  expected for sure i just can't believe that they found so many traitors
[02:25:30.560 --> 02:25:35.840]  you mean they're willing to go along yeah it's just human history you're
[02:25:35.840 --> 02:25:38.160]  always going to have those are willing to go along for their own for their own
[02:25:38.160 --> 02:25:41.600]  personal gain and for their own skin
[02:25:42.320 --> 02:25:46.320]  but don't they get they lose their skin by acting like that in the end
[02:25:46.320 --> 02:25:49.440]  um i think they they believe that they'll they'll be spared this is the useful
[02:25:49.440 --> 02:25:52.320]  idiot problem right they always believe that they're going to be part of the
[02:25:52.320 --> 02:25:55.440]  the elite and whatever's going to come they'll be they'll be rewarded and they
[02:25:55.440 --> 02:25:59.200]  won't be they won't find out until it's too late
[02:25:59.200 --> 02:26:02.640]  well take Stalin he liked Hitler because Hitler was such a murderer
[02:26:02.640 --> 02:26:05.440]  and this is on record and he thought Hitler would really make a deal with him
[02:26:05.440 --> 02:26:07.520]  when they divided Poland when he got double crossed
[02:26:07.520 --> 02:26:11.280]  he wasn't seen for 10 days because he was so freaked out by it but it was the
[02:26:11.280 --> 02:26:13.280]  Russians ended up having to step up and beat Hitler
[02:26:13.280 --> 02:26:16.880]  wasn't Stalin who then got the credit but it showed how he was a useful idiot too
[02:26:16.880 --> 02:26:19.280]  to Hitler yeah completely and that's the thing
[02:26:19.280 --> 02:26:23.120]  is that you know so the like for the internationalist minded
[02:26:23.120 --> 02:26:27.600]  leftist who will truly believe that they're only helping migrants get here
[02:26:27.600 --> 02:26:31.040]  a lot of them are innocent useful idiots they don't realize what's being done
[02:26:31.040 --> 02:26:34.080]  they're being manipulated but they have been documented in their own country
[02:26:34.080 --> 02:26:37.120]  and in the end they'll be crushed by the globalists they won't have the
[02:26:37.120 --> 02:26:40.320]  the communist utopia that they think they're going to have
[02:26:40.320 --> 02:26:44.880]  well that's another thing you got people all the borders around Venezuela have
[02:26:44.880 --> 02:26:48.960]  been closed except for you and corridors up to the United States
[02:26:48.960 --> 02:26:53.520]  a lot of these are Venezuelans and the people coming here want communism again
[02:26:53.520 --> 02:26:56.400]  right well they're being being told that they're being told that
[02:26:56.400 --> 02:26:59.840]  you deserve this you should come to this country this country was unfair and
[02:26:59.840 --> 02:27:03.680]  imperialistic and you should come here and fly your flag burn the american flag
[02:27:03.680 --> 02:27:07.360]  and we'll all be happy once you help us destroy this country
[02:27:07.360 --> 02:27:11.600]  why do people at stanford and the ninth circuit rule this out in the west coast
[02:27:11.600 --> 02:27:15.680]  put up with them saying take down the american flag it's a hate symbol
[02:27:15.680 --> 02:27:19.760]  and then so many people do it it's like this religion of capitulation i don't
[02:27:19.760 --> 02:27:23.200]  they get it's just gonna be more more more yeah you can never you know
[02:27:23.200 --> 02:27:26.960]  they're gonna complain they'll be satisfied you can't placate them or
[02:27:26.960 --> 02:27:30.480]  satisfy them so you have to fight back you have to say no more
[02:27:30.480 --> 02:27:34.160]  dig your heels in and just stop right there no more
[02:27:34.160 --> 02:27:38.080]  have you heard their radio stations are banning a jingle bells
[02:27:38.080 --> 02:27:42.800]  is that right why is that they just say it's racist they don't say why but again
[02:27:42.800 --> 02:27:46.320]  you say it sounds crazy but if they can get us to agree to that we'll do
[02:27:46.320 --> 02:27:48.160]  anything well that's that's what the NEA
[02:27:48.160 --> 02:27:52.480]  we said last year that they have to oppose white supremacist culture and
[02:27:52.480 --> 02:27:55.520]  what is that it's absolutely everything about america
[02:27:55.520 --> 02:28:00.160]  up until like 1972 or something everything before that is racist all the
[02:28:00.160 --> 02:28:02.880]  founding fathers you know the bill of rights the constitution
[02:28:02.880 --> 02:28:06.320]  itself everything's racist well that's like the old hippie saying kill your
[02:28:06.320 --> 02:28:10.000]  parents right don't trust anyone over 30 right so
[02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:14.560]  anything prior to this modern age of leftist dominated academia
[02:28:14.560 --> 02:28:18.480]  in anything else any other vision of the world is racist and it's always some
[02:28:18.480 --> 02:28:23.120]  dirty communist professor living off taxpayers for 30 years
[02:28:23.120 --> 02:28:26.560]  who's shitting up they're saying don't trust your parents your dad your mom

[02:32:08.880 --> 02:32:12.000]  the first amendment the bill of rights the rest of the bill of rights are
[02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:15.920]  prohibitions they're prohibitions against powerful
[02:32:15.920 --> 02:32:20.080]  organizations and individuals taking those god-given rights from us as

[02:32:22.400 --> 02:32:26.560]  taking them right now
[02:32:26.560 --> 02:32:30.560]  we have seen what they want to do they called it un-agenda 21 now they call
[02:32:30.560 --> 02:32:34.320]  it the un-2030 agenda they want everybody off of the
[02:32:34.320 --> 02:32:38.160]  rural lands they want people out of the suburbs they want to pack everybody
[02:32:38.160 --> 02:32:42.640]  into the cities because that's where it is easiest for them to control
[02:32:42.640 --> 02:32:47.920]  everyone it's the david night show

[02:33:46.960 --> 02:33:49.760]  all right steward rhodes the constitutional lawyer army veteran
[02:33:49.760 --> 02:33:54.400]  patriot former advisement at ron paul obviously and worked in his congressional
[02:33:54.400 --> 02:33:58.400]  offices in dc and he has been all over the border tirelessly with
[02:33:58.400 --> 02:34:01.760]  oathkeepers spend a few minutes we have a lot of new affiliates a lot of new tv
[02:34:01.760 --> 02:34:05.120]  stations a lot of new listeners most will know what oathkeepers is but they may
[02:34:05.120 --> 02:34:09.120]  have heard what the adl said about him or said him probably lost center
[02:34:09.120 --> 02:34:12.400]  tell people who you really are and then you're a smart guy you predicted a lot
[02:34:12.400 --> 02:34:14.880]  of this tell people i mean the facts of what you
[02:34:14.880 --> 02:34:18.000]  repeated during the break about we're not trying to be alarmist
[02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:21.360]  but the globalists are taking the country down trump's a great beachhead but
[02:34:21.360 --> 02:34:24.800]  he just doesn't have enough people to work with in dc and i'm just going to be
[02:34:24.800 --> 02:34:28.240]  honest the positive news the world's awakening the bad news is it's going to
[02:34:28.240 --> 02:34:32.240]  be a long war we're going to win the the evidence all leans towards that big
[02:34:32.240 --> 02:34:35.840]  time but it's going to be really really nasty unless people
[02:34:35.840 --> 02:34:39.600]  really get aggressive peacefully and politically now a lot of people say i'll
[02:34:39.600 --> 02:34:43.120]  just wait for the un soldiers to come it won't be un soldiers it'll be your
[02:34:43.120 --> 02:34:46.960]  own military under globalist control people say oh well i'll do this and that
[02:34:46.960 --> 02:34:52.000]  if you won't get politically active now then you'll never fight in the time
[02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:55.200]  comes and i know the listeners get that you're the best audience in the world i
[02:34:55.200 --> 02:34:58.000]  love you but i want you to just really understand
[02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:01.760]  we're not putting hyperbole out here okay store break it down for them
[02:35:01.760 --> 02:35:05.760]  well that's the thing is that we're what we're seeing now is simply more
[02:35:05.760 --> 02:35:08.800]  attention being brought what's been going on for decades on the border
[02:35:08.800 --> 02:35:12.080]  i went down and did a leaders recon of california i'm here doing one doing one
[02:35:12.080 --> 02:35:14.640]  in arizona i'm here doing one in texas right now
[02:35:14.640 --> 02:35:18.080]  and what we see is is the same thing we've known for for decades the border is
[02:35:18.080 --> 02:35:22.240]  wide open there's not enough border patrol they don't have enough fence it's
[02:35:22.240 --> 02:35:24.480]  the fence they have down there is 30 years old
[02:35:24.480 --> 02:35:27.440]  i could hop over right now you can hop over right now just pull yourself over
[02:35:27.440 --> 02:35:30.240]  it so they need a real fence and they need
[02:35:30.240 --> 02:35:33.440]  more troops they need boots on the ground and what's going to take is the
[02:35:33.440 --> 02:35:36.800]  u.s military we guard the border between north korea and south korea
[02:35:36.800 --> 02:35:40.240]  effectively we've been doing that since the 50s but our country is wide open
[02:35:40.240 --> 02:35:42.880]  so we guard borders all over the world except for our own
[02:35:42.880 --> 02:35:46.640]  so we need to realize the reality is is that we have to take what's happening
[02:35:46.640 --> 02:35:49.680]  right now the attention being brought to the caravans
[02:35:49.680 --> 02:35:52.400]  and push the president to do what has to be done
[02:35:52.400 --> 02:35:55.120]  which is to deploy the u.s military on the border it's the only way you're
[02:35:55.120 --> 02:35:58.080]  going to stop it right now the republicans had two years to build
[02:35:58.080 --> 02:36:01.280]  to fund a border wall and build it they failed to do it they got a better what
[02:36:01.280 --> 02:36:04.960]  two weeks now one last push but i know they're not going to do it
[02:36:04.960 --> 02:36:07.600]  so he's going to have to use the u.s military and he may have to go into
[02:36:07.600 --> 02:36:10.720]  mexico as pershing did and by the way he can use regular
[02:36:10.720 --> 02:36:13.760]  defense funds for this he doesn't need funds yeah he doesn't have to go with
[02:36:13.760 --> 02:36:17.520]  funding he it's a matter of national security just as he does it in afghanistan
[02:36:17.520 --> 02:36:20.560]  or iraq during a war he can go ahead and build the wall
[02:36:20.560 --> 02:36:24.080]  using the u.s military using our our combat engineers get it done and this
[02:36:24.080 --> 02:36:27.600]  is expressly in the constitution this is one of the few things the president as
[02:36:27.600 --> 02:36:30.480]  he expressed perv you on well he's the commander in chief of the
[02:36:30.480 --> 02:36:33.200]  u.s military and so when you're being invaded by
[02:36:33.200 --> 02:36:36.720]  we're in a fourth generation warfare with the cartels very much like the
[02:36:36.720 --> 02:36:40.880]  against isis in the i mean they're the western hemisphere version of isis
[02:36:40.880 --> 02:36:44.800]  child slavery sex slavery women and children being being murdered and
[02:36:44.800 --> 02:36:48.640]  tortured and forced into sex slavery they're the modern day slavers
[02:36:48.640 --> 02:36:52.000]  and every bit as bad as isis and so the president has the authority to do that
[02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:55.120]  in afghanistan iraq during wartime we're facing the
[02:36:55.120 --> 02:36:58.720]  same thing here he could go in as as wilson did order
[02:36:58.720 --> 02:37:02.000]  the troops into mexico post up 10 miles inside
[02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:05.760]  created dmz stopped and crushed the cartels
[02:37:05.760 --> 02:37:09.360]  and cleaned it out and explain why that has to happen because
[02:37:09.360 --> 02:37:13.280]  uh civilian law kicks in once they get across they're under democrat judges
[02:37:13.280 --> 02:37:16.640]  that magnets all the people up here the free stuff it's got to be cut off
[02:37:16.640 --> 02:37:20.400]  we've got to secure the border like we close our doors at night or secure the
[02:37:20.400 --> 02:37:23.920]  airport or anything else it's totally under constitution and so if
[02:37:23.920 --> 02:37:27.600]  mexico doesn't act the u.s. military just just under
[02:37:27.600 --> 02:37:32.560]  it'll be dereliction of duty if as you said we don't move forces in 10 miles
[02:37:32.560 --> 02:37:36.560]  right because you got a failed state mexico is now a failed narcos state
[02:37:36.560 --> 02:37:39.840]  that's run by the cartels it's it's like afghanistan
[02:37:39.840 --> 02:37:42.880]  you had a failed state there run by the taliban and we've got more failed states
[02:37:42.880 --> 02:37:46.720]  guatemala and and and other countries of venezuela to the south
[02:37:46.720 --> 02:37:50.320]  right and so you know so if you're if you're facing a situation like that you're
[02:37:50.320 --> 02:37:54.560]  in a fortnight warfare with the cartels invading your country
[02:37:54.560 --> 02:37:57.440]  and with the collusion of domestic enemies of the constitution who are
[02:37:57.440 --> 02:38:00.320]  communists who are coming right out and saying their their goal is the
[02:38:00.320 --> 02:38:03.200]  destruction no borders no walls no u.s.a. at all
[02:38:03.200 --> 02:38:06.240]  exactly so what should you do about that if you're if your president trump you
[02:38:06.240 --> 02:38:09.120]  should say as as the military commander commander in chief under the
[02:38:09.120 --> 02:38:13.360]  constitution i'm going to defend this country and just do it and we will
[02:38:13.360 --> 02:38:17.520]  support him but he can also call us up as the militia all of us veterans i was
[02:38:17.520 --> 02:38:20.800]  a paratrooper in the army a lot of us are a prior service would be happy to
[02:38:20.800 --> 02:38:23.600]  go down there you know under his command as as the
[02:38:23.600 --> 02:38:27.680]  militia and assist the military and the military trained iraqis didn't know
[02:38:27.680 --> 02:38:31.360]  which way to aim a gun they'd have like eight guys training 14 000
[02:38:31.360 --> 02:38:34.880]  i know some of them that did it we already have all these
[02:38:34.880 --> 02:38:38.640]  already pre-trained people many of them combat decades in the military
[02:38:38.640 --> 02:38:42.640]  could quickly be sworn into emergency even state militias under federal
[02:38:42.640 --> 02:38:45.360]  command well what would the constitutional order of that be
[02:38:45.360 --> 02:38:48.480]  saying it's they like texas with somebody like maybe the model
[02:38:48.480 --> 02:38:51.760]  for the rest of the states to say launch it next month uh with
[02:38:51.760 --> 02:38:55.040]  governor abbott and the and the texas guard which we know is already
[02:38:55.040 --> 02:38:59.520]  the pick of the litter of other folks i mean yeah governor abbott could
[02:38:59.520 --> 02:39:03.600]  call up all the texas veterans as as the spearhead who are already trained
[02:39:03.600 --> 02:39:05.840]  under their under military occupational specialty
[02:39:05.840 --> 02:39:09.040]  and deploy them on the border he can make them part of the state state guard
[02:39:09.040 --> 02:39:12.160]  but also president trump could then turn around and federalize them and call
[02:39:12.160 --> 02:39:14.320]  call them all so i said that correctly would move the states would
[02:39:14.320 --> 02:39:17.520]  immediately be called by the president within one month to mobilize prepare
[02:39:17.520 --> 02:39:19.840]  the force then the and then the president would take a man
[02:39:19.840 --> 02:39:23.440]  well actually he could if california for example refuses to even form a
[02:39:23.440 --> 02:39:26.160]  militia he could call us up and this is something i've checked
[02:39:26.160 --> 02:39:29.920]  with dr brenvier was an expert on militias uh the president could call
[02:39:29.920 --> 02:39:33.520]  us up as the unorganized militia under federal statute right now because the
[02:39:33.520 --> 02:39:36.400]  organized militias the national guard and then under federal statute the
[02:39:36.400 --> 02:39:40.240]  unorganized militias the rest of us um and us veterans goes up to 65 years of
[02:39:40.240 --> 02:39:43.440]  age because of our prior training he could call us up as the militia of the
[02:39:43.440 --> 02:39:45.440]  united states in the federal service right now
[02:39:45.440 --> 02:39:48.560]  and deploy us on the border even if the governor california doesn't want you to
[02:39:48.560 --> 02:39:52.000]  go if you're a california patriot you can go
[02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:55.760]  it can be done i understand but then the media knows the public's ignorant would
[02:39:55.760 --> 02:39:59.840]  try to confuse that and say he's raising a vigilante army yes but but if if if
[02:39:59.840 --> 02:40:03.120]  people that could just reshine into the state guard
[02:40:03.120 --> 02:40:05.200]  that would probably be the way to have them not be able to run around like
[02:40:05.200 --> 02:40:07.840]  chickens with their heads cut off well it's it's better if governor abin it's
[02:40:07.840 --> 02:40:11.920]  mother patriot governor would do that exactly right but for for california
[02:40:11.920 --> 02:40:16.080]  if you're a california veteran and the president united states calls up the
[02:40:16.080 --> 02:40:19.280]  texas state guard and then your governor refuses to form one
[02:40:19.280 --> 02:40:22.720]  then he he can say well you've refused to do your duty i'm going to go ahead and
[02:40:22.720 --> 02:40:26.400]  well then it goes like lincoln has started removing governors
[02:40:26.400 --> 02:40:29.520]  well i mean he should be prosecuted what he should be doing no prosecuted for
[02:40:29.520 --> 02:40:31.760]  for collusion i'm not defending all the things that
[02:40:31.760 --> 02:40:34.720]  lincoln did let's just say this is all we've been down this road before
[02:40:34.720 --> 02:40:36.960]  right we don't want to do what lincoln did because lincoln did violate the
[02:40:36.960 --> 02:40:40.480]  constitution yeah so what i'm talking about is a constitutional call-up of the
[02:40:40.480 --> 02:40:43.440]  meet the people as so what do you do if a governor
[02:40:43.440 --> 02:40:46.640]  orders the state police to resist the military the californians basically said
[02:40:46.640 --> 02:40:49.280]  they do that well the state police will hopefully
[02:40:49.280 --> 02:40:52.880]  i'll follow their oath but if not then president can call the
[02:40:52.880 --> 02:40:55.920]  national guard and call us up as the militia and will go suppress the
[02:40:55.920 --> 02:41:00.240]  insurrection that's what that would be if you're executing the laws of the union
[02:41:00.240 --> 02:41:03.120]  which are under the constitution no i know that's the sanctuary city's like
[02:41:03.120 --> 02:41:07.600]  oakland the mayor that said resists the ice
[02:41:07.600 --> 02:41:11.680]  with me she said resists them and if they follow those those unlawful orders
[02:41:11.680 --> 02:41:15.520]  then they're the guilty of insurrection and that's what the militia's for us is
[02:41:15.520 --> 02:41:18.080]  a precedent insurrection but we all know on average even in
[02:41:18.080 --> 02:41:20.000]  leftist areas most of the police aren't leftists
[02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:22.720]  is there in the real world they wouldn't follow those orders yeah they probably
[02:41:22.720 --> 02:41:25.920]  would not what they wouldn't follow it well
[02:41:25.920 --> 02:41:29.520]  here's one one caveat is that you look at the red flag laws like in maryland
[02:41:29.520 --> 02:41:33.120]  where they shot a gun owner you had state police and you had police officers
[02:41:33.120 --> 02:41:36.320]  there who would follow those orders because they're worried about their job
[02:41:36.320 --> 02:41:38.960]  but i think if the president were to pull the military
[02:41:38.960 --> 02:41:42.000]  or the militia into california and say we're going to execute the laws of the
[02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:45.280]  union as a precedent insurrection i think the police then would do the right
[02:41:45.280 --> 02:41:47.920]  thing by the way we're not just here saying this to be fanciful because it's
[02:41:47.920 --> 02:41:50.960]  exciting we're under un global assault they already
[02:41:50.960 --> 02:41:54.480]  basically brought down europe with 15 million military men they've done this
[02:41:54.480 --> 02:41:58.160]  this country is under siege this is we're under world government attack the news
[02:41:58.160 --> 02:42:01.920]  is saying the president can't say the word nation they're saying take the
[02:42:01.920 --> 02:42:05.280]  american flag down at universities everywhere we're under attack folks this
[02:42:05.280 --> 02:42:08.080]  is it i just can't believe they got so many damn
[02:42:08.080 --> 02:42:11.040]  collaborators man well that's why the people like you said
[02:42:11.040 --> 02:42:14.080]  there's one good side to all the warfare and the war on terror
[02:42:14.080 --> 02:42:18.560]  is we now have a massive pool of combat veterans from iraq and afghanistan
[02:42:18.560 --> 02:42:23.520]  so if the president calls us up the veterans first because we are trained
[02:42:23.520 --> 02:42:26.640]  and says i need your help to secure the nation
[02:42:26.640 --> 02:42:29.760]  against both foreign invaders and domestic enemies against this
[02:42:29.760 --> 02:42:33.520]  insurrection we will answer the call which we go back to larry grathwald and
[02:42:33.520 --> 02:42:37.280]  the weathermen and the and the plan the commies had in the 80s
[02:42:37.280 --> 02:42:40.240]  to pull this there and we got manipulated i did by the left-wing oh ronald
[02:42:40.240 --> 02:42:43.920]  regens playing martial law no he wasn't rex 84 was a plan in case they did this

[02:50:26.080 --> 02:50:28.960]  lot of great points what are other points you'd like
[02:50:28.960 --> 02:50:31.600]  to impart to the audience i mean i i want to make this point
[02:50:31.600 --> 02:50:34.800]  i know our audience is more awake than we are in many respects we're kind of
[02:50:34.800 --> 02:50:37.680]  preaching the choir but we're reaching new people every day and the
[02:50:37.680 --> 02:50:40.960]  establishment demonizes you my shelf many others it's a bad
[02:50:40.960 --> 02:50:43.680]  you honor so that people are psychologically inoculated when they
[02:50:43.680 --> 02:50:46.960]  hear us the first time they don't take it serious
[02:50:46.960 --> 02:50:50.480]  just like jama costa a month ago told trump there is no
[02:50:50.480 --> 02:50:54.080]  caravan and i didn't grab the mic from the woman alex jones is a liar
[02:50:54.080 --> 02:50:58.080]  i mean they really are trying to gaslight us yeah definitely and that's why
[02:50:58.080 --> 02:51:03.360]  we can't let them suppress us too many on the right have become
[02:51:03.360 --> 02:51:06.080]  afraid to even speak out it's as though
[02:51:06.080 --> 02:51:10.000]  hillary had won they're they're afraid of being censored they're afraid of being
[02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:12.640]  but put on a list and they're they're acting as though you know they're
[02:51:12.640 --> 02:51:15.760]  living under a dictatorship and they've got to step out and say okay
[02:51:15.760 --> 02:51:19.760]  we're not going to be controlled by fear we're going to go and do what's right
[02:51:19.760 --> 02:51:22.560]  it's what we're doing is water operation we want our people to get out of the
[02:51:22.560 --> 02:51:25.680]  border um both in when it comes to operationally and
[02:51:25.680 --> 02:51:28.480]  also in protest there should be patriots on the border
[02:51:28.480 --> 02:51:31.760]  like i talked to biker's for trump about this we should be down there in mass
[02:51:31.760 --> 02:51:35.120]  supporting the president showing our support oh here's an example
[02:51:35.120 --> 02:51:39.040]  we sent our reporters last month for three weeks total off and on
[02:51:39.040 --> 02:51:43.520]  uh you know so savannah hernandez uh greg rish and others
[02:51:43.520 --> 02:51:47.440]  and there's almost no patriots down there covering it instead antifa comes over
[02:51:47.440 --> 02:51:51.840]  and threatens them right five to one a bunch of thugs i mean that's that's not
[02:51:51.840 --> 02:51:54.240]  right well that's why we have to be down there
[02:51:54.240 --> 02:51:57.120]  and so i think i think what's what's called upon is for us to do a full
[02:51:57.120 --> 02:52:01.040]  court full court press to get down there in mass and protest and say we're here
[02:52:01.040 --> 02:52:04.480]  to support the president and protest this invasion of our country and call it
[02:52:04.480 --> 02:52:08.560]  what it is it's a domestic enemy communist enemy who hate this country
[02:52:08.560 --> 02:52:11.840]  and collusion with foreign enemies the cartels who are modern day slavers
[02:52:11.840 --> 02:52:14.080]  make that point and they're using kids as shields
[02:52:14.080 --> 02:52:17.520]  yeah and so you know go down there and be be in their face
[02:52:17.520 --> 02:52:20.400]  and then at the same time we have volunteer pilots who be flying over the
[02:52:20.400 --> 02:52:22.640]  border we've got drone operators will be flying
[02:52:22.640 --> 02:52:25.440]  drones helping to spot and report for border patrol
[02:52:25.440 --> 02:52:28.320]  and we just need boots on the ground on the on the border as well
[02:52:28.320 --> 02:52:32.720]  to show our support if us veterans step up for as a tipping a point of the
[02:52:32.720 --> 02:52:35.760]  spear and say we support the president with our boots on the ground
[02:52:35.760 --> 02:52:38.400]  demonstrating what needs to be done needs more troops
[02:52:38.400 --> 02:52:41.840]  turn my brothers in for a brag loose my other paratrooper brothers
[02:52:41.840 --> 02:52:45.600]  who are current serving but until you do that i'll be on the border with my other
[02:52:45.600 --> 02:52:49.040]  veteran buddies and we'll do what we can to spot and report for border patrol
[02:52:49.040 --> 02:52:52.720]  and again act like it's over and above the call of duty or that way it's weird
[02:52:52.720 --> 02:52:55.680]  to care about your border it'd be one thing if we were getting invaded by
[02:52:55.680 --> 02:52:59.600]  switzerland but we're literally being invaded by globalist controlled
[02:52:59.600 --> 02:53:03.040]  collapsed countries and they admit this is their main attack
[02:53:03.040 --> 02:53:06.160]  this is it this is the takedown of our country
[02:53:06.160 --> 02:53:09.360]  this is the plan and so this is this is like
[02:53:09.360 --> 02:53:13.360]  not going off and fighting the country overseas this is doing it here
[02:53:13.360 --> 02:53:18.000]  exactly and they're also relying on the complacency of people both you know
[02:53:18.000 --> 02:53:20.960]  president trump's got this the military should be doing this let the
[02:53:20.960 --> 02:53:24.720]  military do it or let the border patrol do it why are you trying to do their job
[02:53:24.720 --> 02:53:28.000]  well i talked to border patrol agents in california let me know that
[02:53:28.000 --> 02:53:30.560]  well one guy i talked to is from vermont was brought down from the from the
[02:53:30.560 --> 02:53:33.760]  border with canada and he was brought to california
[02:53:33.760 --> 02:53:37.200]  and then in touch with another another guy next to him who was from
[02:53:37.200 --> 02:53:41.040]  california said hey we're being pushed west towards san ricidro the area where
[02:53:41.040 --> 02:53:44.080]  we were in is now open and he said we would
[02:53:44.080 --> 02:53:47.120]  welcome you guys to be down here to help us please come down
[02:53:47.120 --> 02:53:50.240]  so they let us know the guys boots on the ground and border patrol
[02:53:50.240 --> 02:53:53.520]  want extra eyes and ears on the border because they appreciate the help
[02:53:53.520 --> 02:53:56.880]  but of course if you go down there the left will label you a racist so we have
[02:53:56.880 --> 02:54:01.360]  to just stop caring what the left does and go do what's right
[02:54:01.360 --> 02:54:04.960]  and also under obama it's not been as bad under
[02:54:04.960 --> 02:54:08.320]  trump they give him orders to pick up trash or write tickets to teenagers
[02:54:08.320 --> 02:54:11.760]  drinking beer on the u.s side the border patrol doesn't need to be doing that
[02:54:11.760 --> 02:54:15.120]  they need to be stopping right the human smugglers the people come across
[02:54:15.120 --> 02:54:17.920]  well i mean this is one thing to happen with among the border watchers
[02:54:17.920 --> 02:54:21.280]  whether they were the border border patrol themselves or the volunteers on
[02:54:21.280 --> 02:54:23.920]  the board with the minute men is during the obama administration they got
[02:54:23.920 --> 02:54:27.040]  discouraged because you had you know charter flights coming in and you had
[02:54:27.040 --> 02:54:31.360]  bus loads being brought into the interior it was it was almost a you know
[02:54:31.360 --> 02:54:34.560]  kind of pointless even try to defend the border but now it's different you got
[02:54:34.560 --> 02:54:36.560]  for president trump who does care about the border
[02:54:36.560 --> 02:54:40.000]  it's a different paradigm the board patrols morale is up and it's important
[02:54:40.000 --> 02:54:45.040]  for us patriots to get back in there for the second win and support them
[02:54:45.040 --> 02:54:48.080]  i don't think that they've given up i mean for now
[02:54:48.080 --> 02:54:52.880]  mexico sent the main caravan back 40 miles from teowana and the san diego
[02:54:52.880 --> 02:54:56.400]  border uh and and for now they back down
[02:54:56.400 --> 02:55:00.160]  but the u.n camps and the people we talked to are pissed off we're promised
[02:55:00.160 --> 02:55:03.680]  all this stuff we were told we'd be let in and they named the u.s
[02:55:03.680 --> 02:55:07.200]  organizations that soros funds and we go back to that
[02:55:07.200 --> 02:55:10.160]  yeah get down there now trump put the motor on the border but
[02:55:10.160 --> 02:55:14.240]  cut off the u.n funding cut off the state department funding the usa id cut off
[02:55:14.240 --> 02:55:17.760]  the funding george soros's open foundation cut off the carney endowment
[02:55:17.760 --> 02:55:20.640]  funding i mean that's what's happening you have these tax-free foundations
[02:55:20.640 --> 02:55:25.280]  using our money to destroy us and the daily grind on the border is the real
[02:55:25.280 --> 02:55:29.040]  story these these caravans are actually kind of a
[02:55:29.040 --> 02:55:32.960]  distraction in a way every day tens of thousands come
[02:55:32.960 --> 02:55:37.040]  across the border it's like 10 people 100 people 50 people exactly
[02:55:37.040 --> 02:55:40.720]  right exactly yeah that's that's the flood that that's a constant flood and
[02:55:40.720 --> 02:55:43.840]  all of a sudden here's this one issue that people look at it's great to have
[02:55:43.840 --> 02:55:46.880]  attention brought to it but it's that day to day grind that's going to be going
[02:55:46.880 --> 02:55:50.480]  on even after these caravans are gone and let's be clear what the caravans are
[02:55:50.480 --> 02:55:54.320]  the first year trump was in people had the idea he stopped people coming in
[02:55:54.320 --> 02:55:58.000]  so it cut the numbers by 90 percent now folks figured out because the u.n and
[02:55:58.000 --> 02:56:00.640]  others run tv ads all over the world saying no it's open
[02:56:00.640 --> 02:56:04.400]  they're showing these caravans hoping they get through like they did in europe
[02:56:04.400 --> 02:56:07.840]  six years ago to start the flood that's why it's critical to cut them off but
[02:56:07.840 --> 02:56:10.640]  you're right you already have the 30 plus million that got
[02:56:10.640 --> 02:56:14.560]  illegally uh with just the poorest border it's
[02:56:14.560 --> 02:56:18.320]  important to expose that but also break the main assault
[02:56:18.320 --> 02:56:21.280]  yeah well it's it's gonna take the u.s military and then we got to address the
[02:56:21.280 --> 02:56:23.840]  issue with the 30 million illegals already in the country that's gonna be a
[02:56:23.840 --> 02:56:26.560]  difficult issue to deal with how do you how do you deal with that
[02:56:26.560 --> 02:56:30.880]  so we'll get the stop the flood coming in and you can take the military to do it
[02:56:30.880 --> 02:56:35.600]  well look here here's the thing the average illegal that got here before
[02:56:35.600 --> 02:56:38.080]  many of them do just want to work or whatever but still they're double the
[02:56:38.080 --> 02:56:40.960]  number you end up committing crimes there's a lot of them are criminals
[02:56:40.960 --> 02:56:45.280]  are coming in what do you do though when they've brought in 30 million people
[02:56:45.280 --> 02:56:48.080]  who are here just illegally what do you do about that
[02:56:48.080 --> 02:56:51.600]  um i think deportation what you have to what you have to do like eisenhower did
[02:56:51.600 --> 02:56:54.320]  back in uh back in the day you know to be blunt
[02:56:54.320 --> 02:56:57.040]  that's what's going to take but how do you do that when you've got like i said
[02:56:57.040 --> 02:56:59.600]  domestic enemies who now control the house representatives
[02:56:59.600 --> 02:57:02.960]  who are going to oppose you in every every term for them comes a deportation
[02:57:02.960 --> 02:57:06.720]  but i think uh president trump what he could do is is go deport order ice
[02:57:06.720 --> 02:57:09.600]  to go out there and find and deport all he possibly can
[02:57:09.600 --> 02:57:12.880]  while he's still here we're going to go to break in one more segment than paul
[02:57:12.880 --> 02:57:17.520]  joseph watson's taking over and it's it's just the truth ladies and gentlemen
[02:57:17.520 --> 02:57:20.400]  you import the third world you become the third world there are a lot of good
[02:57:20.400 --> 02:57:23.440]  people coming from the third world the issue is they're being politicized
[02:57:23.440 --> 02:57:26.240]  they're being weaponized by the democrats by the globalist
[02:57:26.240 --> 02:57:30.080]  and that's why it has to stop this is an attempt to break our sovereignty
[02:57:30.080 --> 02:57:34.160]  to the point of mainstream media even saying saying that we are a nation is
[02:57:34.160 --> 02:57:38.000]  evil and bad that is what a foreign conqueror says
[02:57:38.000 --> 02:57:40.880]  and we're not going to put up with it we'll be right back with hour number four
[02:57:40.880 --> 02:57:45.040]  please spread the live links and tell folks about local stations
[02:57:45.040 --> 02:57:49.360]  we are kept afloat only by your loyal patronage
[02:57:49.360 --> 02:57:52.640]  and that's why we need you to go to the site now if you're not in the market
[02:57:52.640 --> 02:57:56.480]  for one of our greatest nutraceuticals please consider a
[02:57:56.480 --> 02:57:59.760]  contribution twenty five fifty a hundred
[02:57:59.760 --> 02:58:04.640]  two fifty or even five hundred dollars would be a godsend to our important
[02:58:04.640 --> 02:58:08.400]  work here to beat back the globalists and to destroy

[03:00:20.560 --> 03:00:23.200]  hundred points on fears of slowing economy
[03:00:23.200 --> 03:00:26.480]  sturt roads you're going to do a call out here for volunteer
[03:00:26.480 --> 03:00:32.240]  pilots to help expose what's happening put eyes and ears on the border
[03:00:32.240 --> 03:00:35.760]  and also you wanted to make a comment on george herbert walker bush i mean the
[03:00:35.760 --> 03:00:40.560]  best uh best republican democrats ever had
[03:00:40.560 --> 03:00:44.240]  exactly um we need volunteer pilots in fact we need
[03:00:44.240 --> 03:00:46.960]  volunteer boots on the ground and pilots all across the border and all the
[03:00:46.960 --> 03:00:50.960]  border states so if you're a pilot has access to a plane
[03:00:50.960 --> 03:00:55.440]  um we will be taking donations provide the fuel but if you won't fly
[03:00:55.440 --> 03:00:58.320]  please go to our website we have a call to action up right now
[03:00:58.320 --> 03:01:02.560]  go to the oathkeepers dot org and uh and volunteer whether your boots on the
[03:01:02.560 --> 03:01:05.440]  ground as a as a as a volunteer veteran on the ground
[03:01:05.440 --> 03:01:08.560]  or if you're a pilot or if you're a drone operator we need all that we need
[03:01:08.560 --> 03:01:11.760]  all people like that that have those kind of skill sets to volunteer and step
[03:01:11.760 --> 03:01:15.120]  up and help us on the border to back up border patrol and and provide more eyes
[03:01:15.120 --> 03:01:17.680]  and ears we'll also be doing security operations for
[03:01:17.680 --> 03:01:20.800]  ranches on request if they have a situation where they're afraid for
[03:01:20.800 --> 03:01:23.440]  their families or themselves then we will provide security boots on the
[03:01:23.440 --> 03:01:27.120]  ground but a big focus is going to be the force multiplier being in the air
[03:01:27.120 --> 03:01:31.280]  that's a huge asset for us and we've caught just been on the border probably
[03:01:31.280 --> 03:01:35.840]  30 times over the years five or six times heroin cocaine marijuana being
[03:01:35.840 --> 03:01:39.040]  brought across showing up as we first caught six
[03:01:39.040 --> 03:01:42.000]  years ago the buses being brought in when nobody even really knew that they
[03:01:42.000 --> 03:01:45.760]  wasn't kids that were just loading adults on unchecked we got that so
[03:01:45.760 --> 03:01:48.160]  just going down there you never know what you're going to catch
[03:01:48.160 --> 03:01:52.000]  exactly and so it's it's it's that presence that draws attention and then
[03:01:52.000 --> 03:01:56.080]  do a web blog do a youtube video call on the talk radio meet the people i mean
[03:01:56.080 --> 03:01:58.960]  it that's what it's it's a real adventure you bet and if you're not
[03:01:58.960 --> 03:02:02.720]  able to go out and deploy to actually do a observant report operations
[03:02:02.720 --> 03:02:06.080]  go down and show your support for the policy of the president
[03:02:06.080 --> 03:02:09.680]  what he's doing now he's he's stepping towards a full deployment
[03:02:09.680 --> 03:02:12.640]  support yeah because we're down there and nobody's there in antifa and our
[03:02:12.640 --> 03:02:15.520]  people stand up to him but i mean you know we got two camera people there and
[03:02:15.520 --> 03:02:18.240]  there's like six handy for going a little kick your ass come
[03:02:18.240 --> 03:02:21.280]  and it's like wow you know patriots need to be down here you do be down and
[03:02:21.280 --> 03:02:24.960]  protecting the the journalist on the on the right and protecting free speech
[03:02:24.960 --> 03:02:29.520]  and also speaking out in support of the president's policy is absolutely right
[03:02:29.520 --> 03:02:32.720]  antifa it's sick wash is gonna try to go around intimidate people but you know
[03:02:32.720 --> 03:02:36.400]  look at france as you were saying during the break that this is an anti-globalist
[03:02:36.400 --> 03:02:38.960]  revolt and paul watch is about to take over here in a few minutes
[03:02:38.960 --> 03:02:42.400]  they'll be breaking it down yeah i think it's a good indicator you know the
[03:02:42.400 --> 03:02:46.080]  working class people of the of the world ironically you know workers of the
[03:02:46.080 --> 03:02:49.200]  world unite it's kind of happening the other way it's going against the
[03:02:49.200 --> 03:02:53.280]  globalists you know that we're starting to wake up and unite to preserve our way
[03:02:53.280 --> 03:02:57.360]  of life and preserve our families well crony capitalism
[03:02:57.360 --> 03:03:01.200]  is is a nightmare it calls itself communism but it's just
[03:03:01.200 --> 03:03:05.040]  a bunch of corporations offshore creating a nightmare for the general public
[03:03:05.040 --> 03:03:08.720]  it's capitalism and free market that's good for families and good for workers
[03:03:08.720 --> 03:03:11.680]  yeah and people understand that and so i think you're starting to see a revolt
[03:03:11.680 --> 03:03:15.040]  a middle class and working class revolt around the world and it's kind of
[03:03:15.040 --> 03:03:17.440]  bizarre but these radical communist professors
[03:03:17.440 --> 03:03:21.840]  are actually on the side of big business and and the global corporations
[03:03:21.840 --> 03:03:24.880]  and they're ignoring the working class that's the big game changer the
[03:03:24.880 --> 03:03:28.560]  political operatives are all corporate funded and call themselves socialist
[03:03:28.560 --> 03:03:31.840]  communist and they all race bait now because they know the whole
[03:03:31.840 --> 03:03:35.120]  class struggle of economics doesn't work because people know socialism doesn't
[03:03:35.120 --> 03:03:37.600]  work right so now they're going to race bait but
[03:03:37.600 --> 03:03:40.800]  if you look at the studies in germany and in spain and in idly
[03:03:40.800 --> 03:03:45.920]  what's making the nationalist win is coalitions of socialist and union people
[03:03:45.920 --> 03:03:48.800]  figuring out wait you're going to bring in 10 million legal aliens
[03:03:48.800 --> 03:03:52.880]  to drive down my wages and take my job so it's actually a coalition of socialist
[03:03:52.880 --> 03:03:55.760]  and nationalist that's now taking europe back
[03:03:55.760 --> 03:03:58.880]  look what happened with trump being elected he was he was elected by the
[03:03:58.880 --> 03:04:02.800]  rust belt by guys used to work in gm and in the factories realizing that if you
[03:04:02.800 --> 03:04:06.240]  want to have america be great again and have jobs again we got to elect someone
[03:04:06.240 --> 03:04:09.680]  that's going to protect our our economy and that's why he's elected
[03:04:09.680 --> 03:04:13.520]  you know and he's really trying i can't believe gm made all those record profits
[03:04:13.520 --> 03:04:17.840]  bought back their stock and is moving to china well of course
[03:04:17.840 --> 03:04:21.600]  corporate raiders right corporate pirates so they're they're going to just take
[03:04:21.600 --> 03:04:25.360]  what they want and and leave leaving the uh the worker holding the bag
[03:04:25.360 --> 03:04:28.880]  where they're going is to be state run in china where they pay no tax now
[03:04:28.880 --> 03:04:32.400]  and that is treason right there you know to certain point folks we're all
[03:04:32.400 --> 03:04:34.720]  free market but when you go to these outside countries
[03:04:34.720 --> 03:04:37.120]  that are rigging everything you gotta have a president will stand up to that
[03:04:37.120 --> 03:04:40.400]  and people finally got it but you know there's one point you make about
[03:04:40.400 --> 03:04:44.000]  trump that he's doing bad on stewart roads and i want to
[03:04:44.000 --> 03:04:46.880]  come back and introduce paul wasp and we'll do two minutes on red flagging
[03:04:46.880 --> 03:04:50.880]  we're back in 60 seconds we'll get you some of that texas barbecue news wars
[03:04:50.880 --> 03:04:56.160]  dot com tomorrow's news today the globalists know that if they suppress
[03:04:56.160 --> 03:04:59.120]  the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens
[03:04:59.120 --> 03:05:04.160]  fluoride chlorine bromide you name it that it lowers iq it literally
[03:05:04.160 --> 03:05:08.320]  dumps the population down and on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers
[03:05:08.320 --> 03:05:11.040]  the best iodine in the world we've gone through
[03:05:11.040 --> 03:05:14.560]  two permutations first seaweed based iodine
[03:05:14.560 --> 03:05:17.680]  that was pretty good but hard to source and the globalists tried to block us
[03:05:17.680 --> 03:05:21.760]  getting a supply of it so we discovered deep earth crystals of pure
[03:05:21.760 --> 03:05:25.280]  nascent iodine and brought you x2 that's been incredible
[03:05:25.280 --> 03:05:28.960]  now due to the establishment trying to block that we did more research and
[03:05:28.960 --> 03:05:33.280]  secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine but
[03:05:33.280 --> 03:05:37.040]  chemists scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it with
[03:05:37.040 --> 03:05:41.360]  three other compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin c it
[03:05:41.360 --> 03:05:46.320]  supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable
[03:05:46.320 --> 03:05:48.960]  ladies and gentlemen you want to research it you want to see it
[03:05:48.960 --> 03:05:55.280]  it's an incredible discovery x3 now available at m4slife.com
[03:06:07.680 --> 03:06:13.040]  it's amazing how you can speak you know skirt roge paul watz has taken over
[03:06:13.040 --> 03:06:18.480]  from england with the riots in france and macron capitulating and
[03:06:18.480 --> 03:06:21.760]  nigel ferrage of u kip were leaving because of
[03:06:21.760 --> 03:06:25.600]  tony robinson being part of the party so much is coming up
[03:06:25.600 --> 03:06:29.680]  stock market plunging 800 points and back to 647 points
[03:06:29.680 --> 03:06:32.800]  but i tell you it's been an amazing year here for globalism
[03:06:32.800 --> 03:06:36.480]  has lost every election around the world except venezuela and the us
[03:06:36.480 --> 03:06:39.440]  we know both those are rigged it's been documented
[03:06:39.440 --> 03:06:43.040]  so the populism nationalism is exploding people are aware of globalism from
[03:06:43.040 --> 03:06:47.360]  brazil to to italy uh from austria to germany
[03:06:47.360 --> 03:06:50.320]  everywhere the globalists are losing elections the last six years
[03:06:50.320 --> 03:06:53.280]  except for venezuela and the us because things are so rigged
[03:06:53.280 --> 03:06:57.440]  but we had zebicki brzezinski died this year we had john mccain died we had
[03:06:57.440 --> 03:07:00.400]  george overt walker bush died we had david rockefeller died
[03:07:00.400 --> 03:07:04.160]  and the clintons cannot get anybody at any crowd size
[03:07:04.160 --> 03:07:09.200]  at their events so poppy got in uh confidence to be reborn into the order
[03:07:09.200 --> 03:07:12.720]  of death but this time it's not an initiation
[03:07:12.720 --> 03:07:16.720]  this time it's real so skirt roger your your comments on that and trump's
[03:07:16.720 --> 03:07:20.080]  overall doing a good job but we've got to draw attention to the bad things
[03:07:20.080 --> 03:07:22.720]  they tell him sir we can't have mentally ill people's guns he's like yeah i
[03:07:22.720 --> 03:07:26.480]  agree but they're saying unadjudicated mentally ill the red
[03:07:26.480 --> 03:07:29.440]  flagging so let's let's let's talk about this year what's
[03:07:29.440 --> 03:07:33.040]  happened briefly and then red flagging uh it's it's good to see the globalists
[03:07:33.040 --> 03:07:35.760]  you know they they can't escape death no matter how rich they are no matter how
[03:07:35.760 --> 03:07:38.640]  corrupt they are at least they can't escape uh
[03:07:38.640 --> 03:07:41.760]  you know mortality so it's it's been it's been good to see you know frankly i'm
[03:07:41.760 --> 03:07:44.720]  glad mccain died and and george bush too and he was
[03:07:44.720 --> 03:07:47.360]  involved in the assassination of kennedy and he's involved in the
[03:07:47.360 --> 03:07:50.560]  destruction of our country and he's a globalist from way back so i don't feel
[03:07:50.560 --> 03:07:54.560]  sorry for him at all i'm glad he's gone and i'm glad you're honest about it
[03:07:54.560 --> 03:07:57.600]  because i just can't bring myself to sit there and pule over these people yeah
[03:07:57.600 --> 03:08:00.800]  i respect the service from world war two but after that he went he went downhill
[03:08:00.800 --> 03:08:05.520]  he went went down into into the you know the deep state rabbit hole
[03:08:05.520 --> 03:08:10.960]  well his dad was the head nazi lawyer in the us right so he's got right so like
[03:08:10.960 --> 03:08:13.360]  you know as a veteran i respect his service but that's about it same with
[03:08:13.360 --> 03:08:18.000]  mccain you know i respect his service for what it was but after that
[03:08:18.000 --> 03:08:20.960]  if you turn on your country and become a trader you're a trader well remember
[03:08:20.960 --> 03:08:24.640]  george warger bush didn't just leave the r.a. he said it should be abolished
[03:08:24.640 --> 03:08:28.320]  yeah that and and also of course you know pushing for a new old order right he
[03:08:28.320 --> 03:08:31.680]  was the first guy to come out and say it publicly well that was exactly that was
[03:08:31.680 --> 03:08:35.360]  because g gordon liddy said if the and i'm not saying this they'll say i said it
[03:08:35.360 --> 03:08:38.960]  he said if the atm comes to confiscate your gun shoot for the face
[03:08:38.960 --> 03:08:42.880]  because they don't have body armor on right okay now that's g gordon liddy
[03:08:42.880 --> 03:08:46.160]  and then he and then they said the whole n r.a. did that and then he left the
[03:08:46.160 --> 03:08:49.680]  nr.a. and the nr.a. should be abolished it's like he was always anti-gun
[03:08:49.680 --> 03:08:53.040]  people don't even know that george w bush was anti-gun oh yeah
[03:08:53.040 --> 03:08:56.320]  and this brings us full circle right now we've got a lot of republicans who are
[03:08:56.320 --> 03:09:00.800]  you know rhinos who are pushing the president to go with red flag laws
[03:09:00.800 --> 03:09:05.920]  which are a gross violation of due process no no process no due process
[03:09:05.920 --> 03:09:09.040]  whatsoever and it's the same process you see the same problem you see with the
[03:09:09.040 --> 03:09:12.720]  domestic violence restraining orders but now it's everybody and anybody your
[03:09:12.720 --> 03:09:15.840]  neighbor some guy down the street some guy like your bumper sticker can call
[03:09:15.840 --> 03:09:19.520]  you call the police on you as an ex parte hearing you don't even know what's

[03:10:26.400 --> 03:10:29.920]  recovery looks like they may have been successful we've got trump walking off
[03:10:29.920 --> 03:10:33.520]  the stage not doing group photos saying get me out of here
[03:10:33.520 --> 03:10:37.120]  we've got Nigel Farage pulling out a u-kip over tommy robinson
[03:10:37.120 --> 03:10:41.120]  we've got five days of rioting and burning and macron backing down
[03:10:41.120 --> 03:10:46.720]  uh with with a 20 percent approval rating i've got stats of articles here
[03:10:46.720 --> 03:10:51.600]  just insanity is unfolding what in god's greener that's going on paul
[03:10:51.600 --> 03:10:56.720]  joseph watson thanks alex yeah the big news obviously out of
[03:10:56.720 --> 03:11:00.800]  france after the riots over the past few days which again
[03:11:00.800 --> 03:11:04.320]  most people don't understand even though this started off as a rival a rival
[03:11:04.320 --> 03:11:08.000]  against the gas tax hikes it's more of a wider
[03:11:08.000 --> 03:11:13.440]  revolt against globalism full stop they had a president elected on the promise
[03:11:13.440 --> 03:11:18.160]  of saving globalism they heralded his arrival as the great savior of
[03:11:18.160 --> 03:11:21.920]  globalism just over a year later after that election
[03:11:21.920 --> 03:11:25.680]  he's got now a 25 percent approval rating is probably even lower at this
[03:11:25.680 --> 03:11:29.040]  point he's got riots on the streets of paris riots on the
[03:11:29.040 --> 03:11:31.920]  streets of leon and they've had to back down after
[03:11:31.920 --> 03:11:36.080]  promising after vowing that they would you know hold their sacred
[03:11:36.080 --> 03:11:39.600]  promise to the eu commission which is basically who controls france and the
[03:11:39.600 --> 03:11:43.040]  un obviously macrons in this big climate
[03:11:43.040 --> 03:11:45.600]  change summit right now as this all goes down
[03:11:45.600 --> 03:11:49.280]  they promised them that they wouldn't back down on these on these gas tariffs
[03:11:49.280 --> 03:11:52.480]  and they've had to do it at least for six months
[03:11:52.480 --> 03:11:55.520]  but now we have this out of bright bar which most people haven't picked up on
[03:11:55.520 --> 03:11:59.520]  today not enough yellow vests to reject temporary
[03:11:59.520 --> 03:12:04.720]  suspension of fuel tax rises in france so macron the government of france came
[03:12:04.720 --> 03:12:08.240]  out and said we're going to temporarily suspend them for six months
[03:12:08.240 --> 03:12:11.680]  the yellow vest movement or at least some representatives from within it have
[03:12:11.680 --> 03:12:15.360]  said that that is not enough the government of macron announced
[03:12:15.360 --> 03:12:19.520]  tuesday a moratorium on the increase of the fuel tax
[03:12:19.520 --> 03:12:22.800]  and it's going to last several months but benjamin cauchy who's become a
[03:12:22.800 --> 03:12:25.520]  major figure in the yellow vest movement
[03:12:25.520 --> 03:12:30.240]  told france info today quote we will not be put to sleep by a moratorium they
[03:12:30.240 --> 03:12:34.240]  used to use them much wider than that he said the french do not want crumbs they
[03:12:34.240 --> 03:12:39.120]  want the breadstick in fall that's a very french response
[03:12:39.120 --> 03:12:43.760]  and they want referendums on major societal issues in fact i did a
[03:12:43.760 --> 03:12:47.200]  article yesterday about this on info wars dot com
[03:12:47.200 --> 03:12:51.520]  where they lay out their demands and they talk about mass migration they talk
[03:12:51.520 --> 03:12:54.960]  about wanting criminal asylum seekers who have either
[03:12:54.960 --> 03:12:58.880]  failed their applications or who have committed crimes while in the country
[03:12:58.880 --> 03:13:02.640]  waiting for their applications to be approved to be
[03:13:02.640 --> 03:13:06.320]  deported so the gas tax hike was not the sole
[03:13:06.320 --> 03:13:10.560]  element of these protests there's another article out of wall street journal
[03:13:10.560 --> 03:13:14.560]  which was linked up on drudge which said after decades of global
[03:13:14.560 --> 03:13:18.080]  conferences forests of reports diet television documentaries
[03:13:18.080 --> 03:13:22.000]  celebrity appeals school curriculum overhauls and media bludgeoning
[03:13:22.000 --> 03:13:25.680]  voters don't believe that climate change justifies policies that would raise
[03:13:25.680 --> 03:13:30.320]  their cost of living and hurt the economy in fact westerners across
[03:13:30.320 --> 03:13:35.120]  both america canada the entirety of europe climate change global warming
[03:13:35.120 --> 03:13:40.160]  routinely comes at the bottom of the list of priorities for voters in all
[03:13:40.160 --> 03:13:44.960]  these different western countries yet they continue to push it and push it
[03:13:44.960 --> 03:13:48.560]  and push it and in france they've pushed it too far
[03:13:48.560 --> 03:13:51.520]  but the leaders of that protest movement have come out and said that that's not
[03:13:51.520 --> 03:13:54.800]  enough they had another rally planned for this
[03:13:54.800 --> 03:13:57.520]  weekend it remains to be seen if that's going to go ahead
[03:13:57.520 --> 03:14:01.040]  literally talking about storming the best deal
[03:14:01.040 --> 03:14:04.640]  during this next round of protests this next weekend
[03:14:04.640 --> 03:14:08.160]  so we'll wait to see if that simmers down i don't think it will simmer down
[03:14:08.160 --> 03:14:11.200]  given that they have a much wider raft of demands
[03:14:11.200 --> 03:14:15.120]  that haven't been met well paul i would tell them as nationalist and patriots
[03:14:15.120 --> 03:14:18.880]  who want sovereignty to get the islamic invaders who are coming out
[03:14:18.880 --> 03:14:22.960]  they need to push now all the way the only reason macron and the roth child's
[03:14:22.960 --> 03:14:25.200]  backed off is because they see the momentum they have
[03:14:25.200 --> 03:14:28.320]  once they back down they're gonna have the secret police target their leaders
[03:14:28.320 --> 03:14:31.680]  they're gonna crack down with censorship i think they should continue moving
[03:14:31.680 --> 03:14:36.160]  against the outside vc french level collaboration
[03:14:36.160 --> 03:14:40.080]  you know the vc collaborated with hitler uh well macrons
[03:14:40.080 --> 03:14:43.680]  with the eu and the globalist they need to remove this foreign government
[03:14:43.680 --> 03:14:47.360]  entirely paul and we salute them and support them i think they need to
[03:14:47.360 --> 03:14:52.480]  strike while the iron's hot that's basically what marina le pen has called
[03:14:52.480 --> 03:14:55.680]  for the question is do they see what's happening over in the
[03:14:55.680 --> 03:14:59.920]  uk where today we had another vote in parliament which means if
[03:14:59.920 --> 03:15:03.600]  therese amaze crappy eu deal gets rejected which it
[03:15:03.600 --> 03:15:07.280]  will because it's not brexit in any form it's just kicking the can down the
[03:15:07.280 --> 03:15:10.960]  road and staying within the eu will we get yellow vest style
[03:15:10.960 --> 03:15:15.440]  demonstrations in the uk i've put a poll on twitter 55
[03:15:15.440 --> 03:15:19.520]  percent say yes i don't think we'll get anything like that to be honest alex
[03:15:19.520 --> 03:15:22.960]  but given the example set by friends it remains to be seen but what i'm saying
[03:15:22.960 --> 03:15:25.760]  is that the yellow vest leaders need to look at what
[03:15:25.760 --> 03:15:30.800]  happened in the uk need to see how far how deeply we've been betrayed
[03:15:30.800 --> 03:15:33.920]  promised and stabbed in the back at every opportune moment
[03:15:33.920 --> 03:15:38.560]  and continue to demand all their demands because this promise of a six-month
[03:15:38.560 --> 03:15:42.080]  moratorium will probably disappear in a hurry
[03:15:42.080 --> 03:15:45.360]  more of paul joseph watson from news wars dot com

[03:20:30.720 --> 03:20:34.960]  just finishing off with that whole france macron yellow vest
[03:20:34.960 --> 03:20:38.720]  revolt uprising that we've seen over the past couple of weeks coming to ahead of
[03:20:38.720 --> 03:20:41.360]  course this past saturday where they had the biggest
[03:20:41.360 --> 03:20:46.720]  riots in 50 years since the infamous student riots of 1968
[03:20:46.720 --> 03:20:51.440]  in paris now i said his approval rating macron the big globalist saviour
[03:20:51.440 --> 03:20:54.800]  was at 25 percent it's actually at 23 percent now
[03:20:54.800 --> 03:20:58.960]  i mean how much lower can it go headline anti nationalist macron
[03:20:58.960 --> 03:21:04.080]  disapproved by 76 percent of french amid massive protests
[03:21:04.080 --> 03:21:08.160]  his disapproval rating is now a colossal 76 percent
[03:21:08.160 --> 03:21:12.640]  and in this article they remind people that he likened nationalism
[03:21:12.640 --> 03:21:17.200]  to treason at their annual remembrance day event or centennial
[03:21:17.200 --> 03:21:21.040]  remembrance day event you'll also remember that macron literally gave
[03:21:21.040 --> 03:21:23.680]  speeches talking about turning europe into
[03:21:23.680 --> 03:21:27.520]  your rabia and importing tens of millions of
[03:21:27.520 --> 03:21:30.640]  africans and tens of millions of more middle easterners
[03:21:30.640 --> 03:21:34.560]  of course when you do that if you import africa
[03:21:34.560 --> 03:21:40.480]  you become africa he also backed the eu army of course he wants the eu to be a
[03:21:40.480 --> 03:21:44.400]  big federal super state he suggested there should be more eu control over
[03:21:44.400 --> 03:21:48.240]  nations and now his pushing tax cuts for the rich
[03:21:48.240 --> 03:21:52.160]  whilst imposing massive tax hikes to the working class
[03:21:52.160 --> 03:21:55.760]  resulting in nearly a month of enormous protests has seemingly helped only helped
[03:21:55.760 --> 03:22:00.480]  his disapproval rating because remember according to all the reports and even
[03:22:00.480 --> 03:22:05.600]  the mainstream media reports admit this the majority of protesters
[03:22:05.600 --> 03:22:12.160]  are both men and women aged 30 to 50 living in the rural areas of france
[03:22:12.160 --> 03:22:16.160]  the ones more dependent on driving cars to get to work
[03:22:16.160 --> 03:22:20.800]  to go about their normal business i mean macrons literally telling these people
[03:22:20.800 --> 03:22:26.320]  who are already suffering i think they've got a 21 youth unemployment rate
[03:22:26.320 --> 03:22:29.360]  their unemployment rate in general is hovering at about
[03:22:29.360 --> 03:22:34.560]  about 10 nationally and the people struggling the mouse not ones living in
[03:22:34.560 --> 03:22:37.760]  the center of paris they're the ones living in the suburbs and in the rural
[03:22:37.760 --> 03:22:43.120]  areas most impacted by this gas tax hike on carbon
[03:22:43.120 --> 03:22:48.400]  emissions as a sacrifice to the altar of the great global warming gods
[03:22:48.400 --> 03:22:51.680]  so they're the ones getting hit the hardest so it's kind of lower middle
[03:22:51.680 --> 03:22:56.160]  class working class people out in the suburbs out in the countryside
[03:22:56.160 --> 03:23:00.720]  and those are the ones at the protest speculation has raged
[03:23:00.720 --> 03:23:04.640]  as to who is behind the violence i would say some of the graffiti some of
[03:23:04.640 --> 03:23:08.560]  that kind of behavior is by the genuine protesters others will just hijack any
[03:23:08.560 --> 03:23:12.480]  kind of demonstration to commit violence as we've seen
[03:23:12.480 --> 03:23:15.040]  but again it has elements of both left and right
[03:23:15.040 --> 03:23:19.280]  you've got a lot of marine lapen supporters there you see they
[03:23:19.280 --> 03:23:23.440]  dubbed the arctic triumph with demanding macron
[03:23:23.440 --> 03:23:28.640]  resign saying that the yellow vests will win but you've got a combination of
[03:23:28.640 --> 03:23:31.760]  right wing you can call them right wing they're not really marine lapen's
[03:23:31.760 --> 03:23:34.560]  platform was not really right wing it was more
[03:23:34.560 --> 03:23:39.760]  you could even say socialist it was a it was nationally protectionist
[03:23:39.760 --> 03:23:43.520]  for french workers then you've got people from the fringe left
[03:23:43.520 --> 03:23:47.520]  john luke melanchon supporters who were also involved in these
[03:23:47.520 --> 03:23:50.800]  protests but now today a poll by polling firm
[03:23:50.800 --> 03:23:57.200]  i thought reveals that barely clinging on 23 percent just 23 percent of the
[03:23:57.200 --> 03:24:01.200]  french support macron and that his approval rating
[03:24:01.200 --> 03:24:06.160]  get this is plummeted by an extraordinary 18 percent in just five
[03:24:06.160 --> 03:24:09.840]  months if that happened to trump i mean it'd be a
[03:24:09.840 --> 03:24:12.800]  it'd be a national story for weeks on end wouldn't it
[03:24:12.800 --> 03:24:17.360]  i mean they they rag on trump for having a what a 40 percent approval rating if
[03:24:17.360 --> 03:24:22.560]  you look at rasmussen it's higher than that but macron is sunk by 18 percent in
[03:24:22.560 --> 03:24:26.000]  the past five months alone that is a stunning
[03:24:26.000 --> 03:24:29.840]  rebuke of globalism he's now on 23 percent
[03:24:29.840 --> 03:24:33.680]  he's at a record low already when he was at 26 percent he was at a record low
[03:24:33.680 --> 03:24:37.120]  for any french president in history at that point of
[03:24:37.120 --> 03:24:41.680]  him being in office and now he's down to 23 percent
[03:24:41.680 --> 03:24:44.880]  the mainstream media are quick to give praise to the hard-pressed globalist
[03:24:44.880 --> 03:24:48.960]  however the french people clearly had enough the attempts to push centrism
[03:24:48.960 --> 03:24:52.400]  or globalist socialism simply not working and the populist message is what
[03:24:52.400 --> 03:24:55.360]  is being embraced and that's exactly the past the
[03:24:55.360 --> 03:24:59.520]  fact you've got populist elements of the fringe left from melanchon being
[03:24:59.520 --> 03:25:02.320]  embraced populist elements from the rye and marine
[03:25:02.320 --> 03:25:05.440]  lapin being embraced and it's this perfect storm
[03:25:05.440 --> 03:25:09.760]  which has brought macron down to an approval rating of just 23 percent
[03:25:09.760 --> 03:25:14.240]  as they give this olive branch which they could whip away at any moment this
[03:25:14.240 --> 03:25:18.560]  promise that they're going to suspend this gas tax hike for six months
[03:25:18.560 --> 03:25:23.280]  even though it's not solely about the fuel tax
[03:25:23.280 --> 03:25:28.080]  moving on though UK politics by the way they had a vote in parliament today
[03:25:28.080 --> 03:25:32.480]  whereby if Theresa May's brexit deal is rejected which it will be because it's
[03:25:32.480 --> 03:25:36.800]  not brexit then parliament will have a say on a no
[03:25:36.800 --> 03:25:40.880]  deal being accepted of course the the reversion the
[03:25:40.880 --> 03:25:44.960]  only outcome if maize deal was rejected was to have a
[03:25:44.960 --> 03:25:48.080]  no deal hard brexit which is the only brexit that could
[03:25:48.080 --> 03:25:52.400]  in reality fulfill the results fulfill the national will of the people who
[03:25:52.400 --> 03:25:56.800]  voted for exactly that in a referendum that was going to be the case we would
[03:25:56.800 --> 03:25:59.520]  crash out with a no deal brexit at least we would have
[03:25:59.520 --> 03:26:03.280]  economic judicial freedom we will be able to make our own trade deals
[03:26:03.280 --> 03:26:06.960]  but no they're now saying that if that happens and her deal is rejected
[03:26:06.960 --> 03:26:09.360]  the parliament's then going to get another vote
[03:26:09.360 --> 03:26:13.280]  on a no deal brexit so again brexit isn't happening
[03:26:13.280 --> 03:26:16.480]  they're just kicking the can further and further down the road
[03:26:16.480 --> 03:26:19.600]  we've been stabbed in the back it's a complete betrayal
[03:26:19.600 --> 03:26:24.400]  and unless we see something on the scale of the yellow vest movement in France
[03:26:24.400 --> 03:26:27.760]  over in the UK that's only going to continue
[03:26:27.760 --> 03:26:30.880]  they're just going to cancel brexit the UK will officially become
[03:26:30.880 --> 03:26:35.120]  an undemocratic country an anti-democratic country
[03:26:35.120 --> 03:26:38.720]  and related to that RT reports Nigel Farage quits
[03:26:38.720 --> 03:26:42.960]  UKIP over parties ties to Tommy Robinson this came out just a couple of
[03:26:42.960 --> 03:26:45.280]  hours ago UKIP founding member Nigel Farage
[03:26:45.280 --> 03:26:48.720]  who of course was the leader but now he's just a member or was until today
[03:26:48.720 --> 03:26:52.240]  has cut his ties with the party accusing its leadership of trying to core extremist
[03:26:52.240 --> 03:26:57.040]  like EDL founder Tommy Robinson who of course has been on the show
[03:26:57.040 --> 03:26:59.440]  several times he said with a heavy heart I'm
[03:26:59.440 --> 03:27:03.680]  leaving UKIP it's not the brexit party our nation so badly needs
[03:27:03.680 --> 03:27:08.560]  now Farage is leaving UKIP today because there's a giant demonstration how
[03:27:08.560 --> 03:27:11.600]  giant it will be remains to be seen but there's a big
[03:27:11.600 --> 03:27:15.680]  brexit rally taking place in London this Saturday
[03:27:15.680 --> 03:27:19.760]  led at least partially by Tommy Robinson and Gerard
[03:27:19.760 --> 03:27:24.320]  Batten who of course is the leader of UKIP now Nigel Farage and he's not alone in
[03:27:24.320 --> 03:27:27.120]  thinking this thinks that because of some of the
[03:27:27.120 --> 03:27:30.880]  criminal elements that surround that kind of movement that you know
[03:27:30.880 --> 03:27:34.640]  that remnant of EDL members football hooligans basically
[03:27:34.640 --> 03:27:38.160]  that that brexit march is going to turn violent of course you could have
[03:27:38.160 --> 03:27:42.160]  provocateurs going and turn it violent that that is going to be used as a
[03:27:42.160 --> 03:27:45.840]  bully stick by the globalists by Theresa May
[03:27:45.840 --> 03:27:49.840]  by the sellout people who have betrayed this country within the conservative party
[03:27:49.840 --> 03:27:53.760]  and within the Labour Party as well to say look these are the kind of thugs
[03:27:53.760 --> 03:27:58.640]  who support no deal who support hard brexit this is why we need to vote for
[03:27:58.640 --> 03:28:03.040]  Theresa May's deal so if they have a giant flashpoint
[03:28:03.040 --> 03:28:07.120]  on Saturday and that this turns into a big riot they're going to use that
[03:28:07.120 --> 03:28:10.400]  to try and ram through Theresa May's deal it's going to be an uphill struggle
[03:28:10.400 --> 03:28:13.760]  because at the moment she's way short of the votes
[03:28:13.760 --> 03:28:18.720]  but that is partially why Nigel Farage has officially today left UKIP and it's
[03:28:18.720 --> 03:28:22.240]  not a secret he's said it in interviews over the past couple of weeks
[03:28:22.240 --> 03:28:25.680]  he said they're going to have unrest they're going to have riots and then
[03:28:25.680 --> 03:28:29.200]  two days later the vote happens so they could provocateur it
[03:28:29.200 --> 03:28:33.680]  they could use that to ram through Theresa May's crappy deal
[03:28:33.680 --> 03:28:36.960]  people on the other side say that Farage has basically cut out and that he
[03:28:36.960 --> 03:28:40.320]  needs to question Islam more as Gerald Batten is doing
[03:28:40.320 --> 03:28:43.680]  if you look at the responses to Farage's article today
[03:28:43.680 --> 03:28:47.120]  that seems to be the weight of the opinion on Twitter but again it's a
[03:28:47.120 --> 03:28:50.080]  difficult situation we'll be back in the next segment to discuss it more this

[03:31:57.520 --> 03:32:00.720]  the real drama can be found here in leilani estates
[03:32:00.720 --> 03:32:03.600]  but a lot of us on the big island rely on rain water
[03:32:03.600 --> 03:32:07.040]  and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain
[03:32:07.040 --> 03:32:10.480]  volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles
[03:32:10.480 --> 03:32:14.400]  and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels
[03:32:14.400 --> 03:32:18.560]  to find out we employed a series of tests for heavy metals
[03:32:18.560 --> 03:32:22.720]  alkalinity and pH what we learned was that there was in fact
[03:32:22.720 --> 03:32:26.640]  unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rain water
[03:32:26.640 --> 03:32:30.480]  next we tested the water from our alexa pure gravity filter
[03:32:30.480 --> 03:32:34.000]  and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure
[03:32:34.000 --> 03:32:37.680]  but the pH was also restored to optimal levels
[03:32:37.680 --> 03:32:42.960]  as it turns out the filter on the alexa pure raises the pH of the water
[03:32:42.960 --> 03:32:47.040]  so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a
[03:32:47.040 --> 03:32:50.720]  rain water supply but more importantly a good water
[03:32:50.720 --> 03:32:54.560]  filtration system will purify it

[03:35:05.840 --> 03:35:08.320]  now just to wrap up i was talking before the break
[03:35:08.320 --> 03:35:12.560]  basically Nigel forage has distanced himself from eukip he's quit the party
[03:35:12.560 --> 03:35:16.880]  because he doesn't like them getting more associated with what he calls
[03:35:16.880 --> 03:35:20.160]  extremists now the american view of tommy robinson
[03:35:20.160 --> 03:35:22.960]  is a lot different from the british view of tommy robinson
[03:35:22.960 --> 03:35:28.240]  of course our politics is a lot more staid a lot more polite a lot more gentle
[03:35:28.240 --> 03:35:32.480]  although not by very much at this point so someone like tommy robinson even
[03:35:32.480 --> 03:35:35.760]  though he's a big hero to a lot of people both within u k and
[03:35:35.760 --> 03:35:40.880]  in america as well people in america don't really see the optics of having him
[03:35:40.880 --> 03:35:44.400]  officially as part of your party even though he's really not i mean they
[03:35:44.400 --> 03:35:47.840]  hired him as an advisor on grooming gangs he's not
[03:35:47.840 --> 03:35:51.760]  even a member of the party at this point as far as i'm aware
[03:35:51.760 --> 03:35:55.440]  so forage is distancing himself from eukip because he thinks that
[03:35:55.440 --> 03:35:58.480]  this is going to turn out bad it's bad optics that they're going to have a
[03:35:58.480 --> 03:36:01.760]  protest this saturday which is going to attract a lot of the
[03:36:01.760 --> 03:36:06.000]  football hooligan element which does still somewhat revolve around tommy
[03:36:06.000 --> 03:36:09.760]  robinson not that he instigates that he constantly broadcasts a message of
[03:36:09.760 --> 03:36:13.680]  peace and non-violence but you do get bad apples and bad
[03:36:13.680 --> 03:36:17.840]  elements within those kind of crowds so that's why forage has left
[03:36:17.840 --> 03:36:21.040]  eukip basically because he thinks there's going to be
[03:36:21.040 --> 03:36:24.720]  maybe some kind of provocation maybe some riots this weekend
[03:36:24.720 --> 03:36:28.320]  and that that will then be used by the political establishment
[03:36:28.320 --> 03:36:32.480]  to say oh look those are the people who support no deal brexit those are the
[03:36:32.480 --> 03:36:36.960]  people who support hard brexit even though the entire 17.2
[03:36:36.960 --> 03:36:40.160]  million people who voted for brexit supported exactly that because it's
[03:36:40.160 --> 03:36:43.840]  the only form of brexit but they're going to point to that and say
[03:36:43.840 --> 03:36:47.520]  those are the thugs those are the loons those are the bigots that support that
[03:36:47.520 --> 03:36:50.880]  that's why we need to support and vote through
[03:36:50.880 --> 03:36:56.640]  tereza maize betrayal deal so that's why nijal forage has distanced himself
[03:36:56.640 --> 03:36:59.440]  from eukip you can see it from both sides
[03:36:59.440 --> 03:37:03.040]  i mean there's been an internal war in eukip between
[03:37:03.040 --> 03:37:07.120]  gerald batten and nijal forage for basically years at this point that's
[03:37:07.120 --> 03:37:11.360]  not a secret everybody knows about it so again it's all about optics
[03:37:11.360 --> 03:37:15.360]  you try to look more reasonable more rational more centrist when you're
[03:37:15.360 --> 03:37:19.920]  broadcasting your message or do you speak the plain
[03:37:19.920 --> 03:37:23.680]  truth the the hurtful truth in many cases
[03:37:23.680 --> 03:37:27.760]  and accept the risk that you will get bad optics with that depending on the
[03:37:27.760 --> 03:37:31.760]  people who you attract to your party it's a difficult situation you can see it
[03:37:31.760 --> 03:37:35.600]  from both sides of the equation but basically that's why forage has quit
[03:37:35.600 --> 03:37:40.480]  eukip today meanwhile in denmark they're
[03:37:40.480 --> 03:37:44.400]  undesirable and they must feel it denmarked to ship unwanted refugees to
[03:37:44.400 --> 03:37:47.760]  remote island denmark will send rejected asylum
[03:37:47.760 --> 03:37:51.600]  seekers to live on a remote island located in the freezing
[03:37:51.600 --> 03:37:56.080]  baltic sea the island is currently home to animal research laboratories
[03:37:56.080 --> 03:38:00.240]  and a crematoria now this is the government of denmark this isn't the
[03:38:00.240 --> 03:38:03.760]  eukip of denmark they're actually in charge they're actually gonna do this
[03:38:03.760 --> 03:38:07.280]  if you are unwanted in danish society this is a quote you should not be a
[03:38:07.280 --> 03:38:10.240]  nuisance to ordinary danes immigration minister
[03:38:10.240 --> 03:38:14.880]  inga stoberg wrote in a facebook post friday they are undesirable in denmark
[03:38:14.880 --> 03:38:19.200]  and they must feel it that is the based red-pilled government
[03:38:19.200 --> 03:38:23.760]  of denmark telling migrants who have committed crimes asylum seekers who
[03:38:23.760 --> 03:38:28.240]  have been rejected that they must go home
[03:38:28.240 --> 03:38:31.120]  another party spokesman said we're going to minimize the number of ferry
[03:38:31.120 --> 03:38:34.880]  departures as much at all possible we're going to make it cumbersome and
[03:38:34.880 --> 03:38:38.400]  expensive as possible they're looking to take the hardest
[03:38:38.400 --> 03:38:42.960]  line on immigration definitely a lot harder than sweden which
[03:38:42.960 --> 03:38:47.040]  basically doesn't even put some rapists in prison who lie about their age
[03:38:47.040 --> 03:38:50.880]  doesn't deport them you remember the famous case of the
[03:38:50.880 --> 03:38:55.360]  the girl the white left-wing activist who literally grounded a plane to
[03:38:55.360 --> 03:38:57.920]  prevent an asylum seeker from being deported from
[03:38:57.920 --> 03:39:01.760]  sweden turned out later that he literally choked his wife and children
[03:39:01.760 --> 03:39:05.040]  with a power cord those are the kind of people they're defending
[03:39:05.040 --> 03:39:09.200]  but now denmark has said that if they're rejected or if they've committed crimes
[03:39:09.200 --> 03:39:12.000]  they're going to put them on a remote island before
[03:39:12.000 --> 03:39:15.840]  deporting them why are they doing that well because of stories like this
[03:39:15.840 --> 03:39:20.400]  also in scandinavia seven adult migrants suspected of
[03:39:20.400 --> 03:39:24.320]  raping 10-year-old finnish girl the police are investigating a
[03:39:24.320 --> 03:39:28.880]  serious sexual assault in ulu of a child so far seven foreign men
[03:39:28.880 --> 03:39:32.080]  suspect suspected of seriously raping the young girl
[03:39:32.080 --> 03:39:36.320]  and serious child molestation apparently this has been going on for months
[03:39:36.320 --> 03:39:39.360]  according to police it's possible there will be more suspects
[03:39:39.360 --> 03:39:43.040]  again the victim was 10 years old
[03:39:43.040 --> 03:39:47.360]  finland isn't it amazing how these kind of cases only started popping up a few
[03:39:47.360 --> 03:39:50.400]  years ago in finland in fact i remember i think it was in
[03:39:50.400 --> 03:39:56.400]  20 late 2015 or early 2016 when finland officially had its first
[03:39:56.400 --> 03:40:00.160]  islamic terror attack wasn't that a coincidence
[03:40:00.160 --> 03:40:04.080]  after the 2015 opening of the borders which saw a lot of
[03:40:04.080 --> 03:40:07.360]  migrants from the middle east coming into scandinavia
[03:40:07.360 --> 03:40:13.360]  meanwhile in germany refugee beats praying priest to death with metal cross
[03:40:13.360 --> 03:40:17.680]  more cultural enrichment lowest simbada 27-year-old asylum seeker from
[03:40:17.680 --> 03:40:20.800]  cameroon admitted to killing a 54-year-old pastor
[03:40:20.800 --> 03:40:25.680]  alain floron gandalu who was from the congo himself during a prayer in berlin
[03:40:25.680 --> 03:40:28.720]  on 22nd of february so again this is this is actually
[03:40:28.720 --> 03:40:32.000]  migrant or migrant violence which you see is very common now
[03:40:32.000 --> 03:40:35.360]  but first he beat the man with the metal cross and moved on to shove an umbrella
[03:40:35.360 --> 03:40:38.000]  down his throat the victim died due to serious
[03:40:38.000 --> 03:40:42.880]  head trauma the perpetrator entered germany's refugee in 2014
[03:40:42.880 --> 03:40:47.680]  claims to be a christian but says he also believes in witchcraft and ghosts
[03:40:47.680 --> 03:40:50.960]  according to his story a ghost that had possessed his brother who also lives in
[03:40:50.960 --> 03:40:54.960]  germany supposedly had taken over his body yeah try
[03:40:54.960 --> 03:40:58.800]  try that one in court although who knows with germany the way it is
[03:40:58.800 --> 03:41:02.240]  at this point in time maybe they'll listen
[03:41:02.240 --> 03:41:07.280]  italy around 2000 migrants are expected to leave
[03:41:07.280 --> 03:41:09.920]  italy every month under tougher rules so again like
[03:41:09.920 --> 03:41:12.880]  demarc italy is getting tough on migration
[03:41:12.880 --> 03:41:17.680]  after the election of a populist government around 2000 migrants are
[03:41:17.680 --> 03:41:22.560]  expected to leave italy per month as humanitarian residency permits expire
[03:41:22.560 --> 03:41:25.600]  following a passage of the migration and security decree
[03:41:25.600 --> 03:41:30.000]  drafted by populist interior minister mattio salvini you recall he got that
[03:41:30.000 --> 03:41:34.160]  vote through parliament in italy quite comfortably
[03:41:34.160 --> 03:41:37.920]  last week or the week before i believe the new migrant and security decree
[03:41:37.920 --> 03:41:40.800]  which is set to come into effect january 2019
[03:41:40.800 --> 03:41:44.560]  scraps the humanitarian residency permit that's currently living in italy
[03:41:44.560 --> 03:41:47.520]  with the humanitarian permits will not be able to renew them
[03:41:47.520 --> 03:41:51.680]  and face deportation instead so they're talking about
[03:41:51.680 --> 03:41:55.280]  2000 a month now when salvini came to power
[03:41:55.280 --> 03:42:01.520]  he said that there were as many as 500 000 illegal migrants in italy
[03:42:01.520 --> 03:42:05.600]  which salvini promised to deport and that's obviously just
[03:42:05.600 --> 03:42:08.720]  scratching the surface but now at least under this new law
[03:42:08.720 --> 03:42:12.560]  they're gonna try and deport 2000 again failed
[03:42:12.560 --> 03:42:17.200]  criminal illegal asylum seekers or migrants these aren't migrants who've
[03:42:17.200 --> 03:42:20.640]  legally emigrated so again italy is following
[03:42:20.640 --> 03:42:26.000]  the example of denmark in getting tough on migration
[03:42:26.000 --> 03:42:29.200]  and again this is part of the protest in france most people don't realize this
[03:42:29.200 --> 03:42:32.240]  if you look at some of the demands of the yellow vest protest as they
[03:42:32.240 --> 03:42:36.240]  specifically said we don't want the migrants coming in we want to hold
[03:42:36.240 --> 03:42:40.320]  them offshore on a foreign country while they apply for their asylum
[03:42:40.320 --> 03:42:44.000]  and not be allowed near france until it's been
[03:42:44.000 --> 03:42:47.600]  approved that is the common sense approach that's what most common sense
[03:42:47.600 --> 03:42:52.800]  people want this is the alex juncture live info wars dot com we'll be back
[03:42:52.800 --> 03:42:56.960]  in the last few months info wars has been escalating our sales to clear out
[03:42:56.960 --> 03:43:00.240]  inventory of many of our best-selling items and then i came up with the idea
[03:43:00.240 --> 03:43:04.000]  last week let's not just extend the sale of free shipping store wide 50 to 75
[03:43:04.000 --> 03:43:09.120]  percent off double patriot points let's extend that sale but also add

[03:43:17.760 --> 03:43:21.920]  best-selling t-shirt while supplies last and what i mean by that is

[03:43:25.520 --> 03:43:29.760]  order that day they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out
[03:43:29.760 --> 03:43:32.800]  then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders so in
[03:43:32.800 --> 03:43:37.600]  the next 12 days we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had
[03:43:37.600 --> 03:43:40.720]  so this is a loss leader we are losing money on this

[03:49:09.280 --> 03:49:12.800]  adl gives tim cock award for censoring online speech
[03:49:12.800 --> 03:49:17.360]  where they literally applauded him for censoring controversial speech
[03:49:17.360 --> 03:49:21.440]  giant corporations deciding what's controversial what's offensive
[03:49:21.440 --> 03:49:25.040]  and of course we've found out what they define as
[03:49:25.040 --> 03:49:27.600]  controversial and offensive in the past couple of weeks
[03:49:27.600 --> 03:49:30.720]  we had jesse kelly the combat veteran suspended
[03:49:30.720 --> 03:49:34.800]  from twitter for no identical identical reason whatsoever
[03:49:34.800 --> 03:49:39.520]  we had laura luma who criticized female genital mutilation
[03:49:39.520 --> 03:49:43.600]  she got blasted off of twitter she's yet to return she won't return
[03:49:43.600 --> 03:49:50.000]  and now tim cock is up there receiving an award receiving platitudes for banning
[03:49:50.000 --> 03:49:54.560]  hate they also had jonathan greenblatt who basically linked hate speech to
[03:49:54.560 --> 03:49:57.920]  criticism of immigration that's also in the new
[03:49:57.920 --> 03:50:01.600]  un migration packed document according to dutch
[03:50:01.600 --> 03:50:05.280]  m e p s which we've featured the articles on info wars dot com
[03:50:05.280 --> 03:50:10.400]  again categorizing criticism of immigration as hate speech
[03:50:10.400 --> 03:50:13.920]  and now we had this happen on twitter yesterday too
[03:50:13.920 --> 03:50:17.600]  is that a gateway ponder twitter suspends humanitarian account for
[03:50:17.600 --> 03:50:22.320]  publishing photos of the war in yemen so this was a left wing account
[03:50:22.320 --> 03:50:25.680]  remember this has happened before on facebook remember that time when they
[03:50:25.680 --> 03:50:30.080]  suspended about 100 different facebook pages left wing
[03:50:30.080 --> 03:50:34.320]  pro drug legalization anti-war facebook and twitter accounts
[03:50:34.320 --> 03:50:38.080]  they were all gone they never came back well now they've suspended
[03:50:38.080 --> 03:50:41.120]  another left-wing account for posting photos of the war in yemen
[03:50:41.120 --> 03:50:44.640]  it isn't just the right that's being subjected to orwellian censorship on
[03:50:44.640 --> 03:50:47.840]  social media twitter is now centering
[03:50:47.840 --> 03:50:52.160]  politics are worthy photos showing the horror of the war in yemen
[03:50:52.160 --> 03:50:55.360]  on tuesday they banned the op desanitize account which
[03:50:55.360 --> 03:50:58.800]  publishes graphic photos from war zones the us is involved in
[03:50:58.800 --> 03:51:02.640]  mainly yemen according to walker braggman an independent journalist
[03:51:02.640 --> 03:51:06.480]  associate with the county the suspension came after they sent a tweet
[03:51:06.480 --> 03:51:10.240]  questioning the center for american progress as connections to the united
[03:51:10.240 --> 03:51:15.600]  arab emirates near attending the president of the center for american
[03:51:15.600 --> 03:51:18.320]  progress and one of hillary clinton's biggest backers
[03:51:18.320 --> 03:51:22.400]  have been at war with reporters of question democratic candidates taking
[03:51:22.400 --> 03:51:25.920]  money from the oil and gas industry so they
[03:51:25.920 --> 03:51:29.920]  basically commit the thought crime of questioning a hillary clinton backer
[03:51:29.920 --> 03:51:32.960]  of posting photos brutal reality photos
[03:51:32.960 --> 03:51:36.960]  which should be protected under journalistic practice
[03:51:36.960 --> 03:51:41.280]  after all hardcore pornography is on twitter that's protected
[03:51:41.280 --> 03:51:44.880]  but don't criticize the war in yemen their accounts got banned they did later
[03:51:44.880 --> 03:51:48.320]  come back because there was a massive outcry against it
[03:51:48.320 --> 03:51:51.520]  and i mean that is the only thing that twitter seems to have improved upon of
[03:51:51.520 --> 03:51:56.400]  late you remember the um they suspended another individual
[03:51:56.400 --> 03:52:00.720]  um who who basically they claimed was under 16 years old he wasn't he came
[03:52:00.720 --> 03:52:03.120]  back so it seems when there is an outcry
[03:52:03.120 --> 03:52:06.880]  that they do actually respond to it now not in the case of law reluma
[03:52:06.880 --> 03:52:11.840]  who is permanently suspended for good meanwhile in london
[03:52:11.840 --> 03:52:15.600]  of course where we have a violent crime way we have stabbings we have murders
[03:52:15.600 --> 03:52:18.880]  on a par with it on some months or even greater in some months
[03:52:18.880 --> 03:52:23.760]  the new york city met police officer under criminal investigation for knocking
[03:52:23.760 --> 03:52:28.080]  down moped teen now to explain we had an explosion of
[03:52:28.080 --> 03:52:32.080]  moped crime where people on mopeds on motorbikes
[03:52:32.080 --> 03:52:36.640]  with helmets or with our helmets just basically drive into an outdoor cafe
[03:52:36.640 --> 03:52:40.400]  area or even some in some cases inside a cafe
[03:52:40.400 --> 03:52:43.760]  steal people's mobile phones steal people's laptops
[03:52:43.760 --> 03:52:48.640]  it's a huge epidemic literally driving into people on the street ripping their
[03:52:48.640 --> 03:52:51.680]  luxury watches off their arms moped crimes
[03:52:51.680 --> 03:52:55.840]  absolutely exploded in the uk and why did it explode
[03:52:55.840 --> 03:52:59.440]  because the police a few years ago were told they were not
[03:52:59.440 --> 03:53:03.200]  allowed to chase these gang members these criminals
[03:53:03.200 --> 03:53:06.800]  driving mopeds if they remove their helmets
[03:53:06.800 --> 03:53:11.440]  and who put that directive into effect it was the then home secretary
[03:53:11.440 --> 03:53:16.480]  now prime minister tereza may they see an example of the kind of crime i'm
[03:53:16.480 --> 03:53:20.000]  talking about so recently they came out and said
[03:53:20.000 --> 03:53:23.120]  we're going to allow police to ram these moped criminals
[03:53:23.120 --> 03:53:28.000]  to apprehend them at least allowing them to chase the thugs chase the criminals
[03:53:28.000 --> 03:53:31.760]  well now a metropolitan police officer who used his car to knock a teenager
[03:53:31.760 --> 03:53:35.760]  off his moped in a tactical contact has been put under
[03:53:35.760 --> 03:53:39.520]  criminal investigation if you criminalize them if you put
[03:53:39.520 --> 03:53:43.600]  them at risk of criminal investigation for actually pursuing criminals
[03:53:43.600 --> 03:53:47.680]  they're not going to pursue criminals criminals are going to become emboldened
[03:53:47.680 --> 03:53:51.520]  crimes going to increase and that's exactly what was happening
[03:53:51.520 --> 03:53:55.520]  these moped criminals are basically just laughing at police as they drove away
[03:53:55.520 --> 03:53:59.360]  they took their helmets off the police couldn't chase them and they would
[03:53:59.360 --> 03:54:03.200]  literally laugh in their face as they slowly drove away
[03:54:03.200 --> 03:54:06.880]  they didn't even need to be in a hurry because legally they couldn't be
[03:54:06.880 --> 03:54:10.720]  chased it was absolutely ridiculous that policy was supposedly
[03:54:10.720 --> 03:54:13.600]  reversed but it isn't being reversed because they're still charging police for
[03:54:13.600 --> 03:54:16.800]  doing it the unnamed officer struck the scooter to
[03:54:16.800 --> 03:54:20.960]  deliberately stop the 17-year-old youth riding dangerously
[03:54:20.960 --> 03:54:24.800]  in southeast london the teenager who was not wearing a helmet at the time
[03:54:24.800 --> 03:54:27.840]  because they know if they do that they're not going to get chased
[03:54:27.840 --> 03:54:31.680]  was taken to hospital with serious head injuries and fractures but was later
[03:54:31.680 --> 03:54:34.880]  discharged so he wasn't seriously hurt they discharged
[03:54:34.880 --> 03:54:39.280]  him from hospital quite fast he later pled guilty to five
[03:54:39.280 --> 03:54:43.200]  offenses including theft dangerous driving and driving without a license
[03:54:43.200 --> 03:54:45.680]  so again this was a criminal he committed crimes
[03:54:45.680 --> 03:54:49.920]  chased by a police officer who tried to use what little power he had to apprehend
[03:54:49.920 --> 03:54:53.200]  the criminal and now the police officer is being
[03:54:53.200 --> 03:54:56.880]  criminally charged and we wonder why moped crime why
[03:54:56.880 --> 03:55:00.800]  stabbings are on the increase meanwhile they've devoted literally
[03:55:00.800 --> 03:55:04.720]  i think it's up to like 900 police officers now to tackle
[03:55:04.720 --> 03:55:09.360]  mean comments on the internet absolutely incredible
[03:55:09.360 --> 03:55:15.200]  meanwhile expert threat of nuke war with russia greatest in 50 years this was
[03:55:15.200 --> 03:55:19.520]  steven f cohen he's basically an expert who's been studying american relations
[03:55:19.520 --> 03:55:23.840]  for the past 50 years he was on tocker carlson last night and
[03:55:23.840 --> 03:55:29.680]  said that russia gate this uh molar investigation and basically
[03:55:29.680 --> 03:55:34.480]  the entire environment that prevents trump from even being able to meet
[03:55:34.480 --> 03:55:38.000]  with putin they had the uh the meeting arranged for
[03:55:38.000 --> 03:55:42.480]  argentina a couple of weeks ago it had to be cancelled because of optics
[03:55:42.480 --> 03:55:47.920]  he said that this has put the united states at risk of nuclear war with russia
[03:55:47.920 --> 03:55:53.760]  the greatest threat for over 50 years he says quote we're embroiled with crises
[03:55:53.760 --> 03:55:57.360]  that are fraught with hot war not just cold war
[03:55:57.360 --> 03:56:01.520]  he went on to say this is not the case talking about the
[03:56:01.520 --> 03:56:05.120]  cuban missile crisis and that's why i think the danger of war with russia
[03:56:05.120 --> 03:56:09.600]  at least since the cuban missile crisis is greater in my lifetime in history
[03:56:09.600 --> 03:56:13.200]  than it's ever been because of these russia gate allegations
[03:56:13.200 --> 03:56:16.640]  for which i've yet to see any authentic evidence
[03:56:16.640 --> 03:56:20.640]  so that is a guy who has 50 years experience studying american russian
[03:56:20.640 --> 03:56:23.760]  relations saying we're at the greatest threat of hot
[03:56:23.760 --> 03:56:29.680]  nuclear war for 50 years plus because of the fact that trump is not allowed to
[03:56:29.680 --> 03:56:34.560]  practice basic diplomacy basic communications as we
[03:56:34.560 --> 03:56:37.360]  had at the height of the cold war as we had at the height of the cuban
[03:56:37.360 --> 03:56:40.800]  missile crisis simply for optics because he would be
[03:56:40.800 --> 03:56:46.000]  accused of being putin's puppet absolutely incredible situation
[03:56:46.000 --> 03:56:51.680]  meanwhile me too backfires wall street's new rule is avoid women at all costs
[03:56:51.680 --> 03:56:56.160]  no one could have predicted this so because men are so petrified now
[03:56:56.160 --> 03:57:00.240]  in wall street and these are the high pressure highly paid professions
[03:57:00.240 --> 03:57:04.560]  to even be around women for fear that they would be accused of sexual
[03:57:04.560 --> 03:57:07.920]  harassment or sexual assault wall street
[03:57:07.920 --> 03:57:12.880]  bigwigs are basically not hiring women at all so that is the effect that me too
[03:57:12.880 --> 03:57:16.880]  has had on women literally stripping women of careers
[03:57:16.880 --> 03:57:21.040]  employment and money another astounding success
[03:57:21.040 --> 03:57:25.600]  for feminists absolutely incredible that's going to wrap it up for the fourth
[03:57:25.600 --> 03:57:28.480]  hour of the alex joneshow again take advantage of that massive
