[00:00.000 --> 00:14.320]  it's sunday september 25th yesterday's most important broadcast now it's
[00:14.320 --> 00:32.040]  september 26th tomorrow be september 27th wars the most banned network
[01:14.640 --> 01:18.520]  ladies and gentlemen of Australia my name is Ricardo Bosie and I am the
[01:18.520 --> 01:23.000]  national leader of Australia one in the coming days weeks and months
[01:23.000 --> 01:27.560]  disturbing rumors concerning the governance of our country will begin
[01:27.560 --> 01:33.440]  to circulate these rumors will appear to be so incredible so unlikely and even
[01:33.440 --> 01:38.640]  so ludicrous that the only sensible response would appear to be to dismiss
[01:38.640 --> 01:43.960]  them out of hand some of these rumors will in time indeed prove to be false
[01:43.960 --> 01:51.400]  unfortunately some will be true and be prima facie evidence of the despicable
[01:51.400 --> 01:57.600]  crimes of treason and sedition and some even morally worse by those at the
[01:57.600 --> 02:04.400]  highest levels of power in Australia during this time it is imperative you
[02:04.400 --> 02:09.720]  monitor closely the responses of those who comprise the polity the judiciary
[02:09.720 --> 02:16.960]  the bureaucracy the military the constabulary the corporations the media
[02:16.960 --> 02:24.280]  academia and religious organizations the case can already be made that many of
[02:24.280 --> 02:29.880]  these people are already a tentative treason but if any remains silent in
[02:29.880 --> 02:34.160]  the face of an obvious attack on Australian sovereignty they will have
[02:34.160 --> 02:39.960]  signed their own death warrants remember them from the governor general and state
[02:39.960 --> 02:44.240]  governors through parliament through all the courts including the high court
[02:44.240 --> 02:49.800]  through the public service the defense force the police forces the boardrooms
[02:49.800 --> 02:54.200]  the unions the charities the mainstream media schools and universities and
[02:54.200 --> 03:02.040]  finally even the churches synagogues mosques temples and lodges remember
[03:02.040 --> 03:07.240]  their names and who they are remember what they said and what they did not
[03:07.240 --> 03:14.560]  say remember what they did and what they did not do why and how has it come to
[03:14.560 --> 03:20.080]  this simply put for decades now we have been deceived by those whom we trust
[03:20.080 --> 03:26.080]  it slowly the truth has been revealed by the tireless efforts of a few and this
[03:26.080 --> 03:31.360]  has been a most difficult task some of you will have heard it said sometimes
[03:31.360 --> 03:36.120]  you can't tell people you just have to show them and to put that in the
[03:36.120 --> 03:40.040]  Australian vernacular some people just need to piss on the electric fence for
[03:40.040 --> 03:45.800]  themselves thankfully enough of us are now awake to the lies and our numbers
[03:45.800 --> 03:55.560]  continue to grow faster every day so what should we do firstly be calm know
[03:55.560 --> 04:01.680]  that we can and will win this war secondly be united no matter how many they
[04:01.680 --> 04:05.880]  send against us they cannot defeat 25 million Australians who stand together
[04:05.880 --> 04:11.400]  as one and simply say in a clear strong and
[04:11.400 --> 04:20.920]  unconquerable voice no consent no consent no consent thirdly be brave some
[04:20.920 --> 04:28.360]  of us might be hurt and some of us might die but if we truly seek liberty we
[04:28.360 --> 04:34.320]  must win it for ourselves nothing worth winning is one cheap way
[04:34.320 --> 04:40.600]  fourthly be good we the people must win this war with nonviolent non-cooperation
[04:40.600 --> 04:45.960]  because the manner of our victory is of foundational importance to the future of
[04:45.960 --> 04:52.320]  Australia as a nation-state we must win this war with such moral authority that
[04:52.320 --> 05:02.440]  we are able to win the piece that follows finally when all is done
[05:02.440 --> 05:09.080]  so the placebo that they have used that the FDA has allowed them to use has
[05:09.080 --> 05:14.400]  often been another vaccine a vaccine with a known adverse reaction profile
[05:14.400 --> 05:20.960]  that's causing death and damage in its own right that it's the aluminum as an
[05:20.960 --> 05:25.440]  adjuvant in the vaccine a known neurotoxin a known immunotoxin a known
[05:25.440 --> 05:30.400]  poison in human beings that is in the supposedly inert placebo totally
[05:30.400 --> 05:36.640]  inappropriate this is not good science it is not science at all it is an effort
[05:36.640 --> 05:41.120]  to cover up the true adverse reaction rates to these vaccines so that they
[05:41.120 --> 05:46.640]  can get through the low barrier of constraints put there by the FDA and
[05:46.640 --> 05:51.400]  onto the market that is the only concern Dr. Wakefield is just one of many

[06:37.520 --> 06:44.200]  Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[06:47.440 --> 06:51.040]  ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us as we kick off this live
[06:51.040 --> 06:57.680]  Sunday September 26th 2021 broadcast we have several special guests joining us
[06:57.680 --> 07:01.600]  today and the reason I'm focusing so much from Texas across the United States
[07:01.600 --> 07:07.800]  and throughout the world on Australia lately is because Australia is tomorrow's
[07:07.800 --> 07:13.560]  news today Australia is next year's news today and what the globalist are doing
[07:13.560 --> 07:17.640]  in Australia what they're doing in the UK what they're doing in Canada what
[07:17.640 --> 07:21.640]  they're doing in the European Union is the designed plan for here in the
[07:21.640 --> 07:28.400]  globalist own words so the hellish permanent lockdown for a quote carbon
[07:28.400 --> 07:32.440]  tax is what is being established now John Bowne is one of our great
[07:32.440 --> 07:36.720]  researchers and reporters he puts together a lot of really compelling
[07:36.720 --> 07:41.120]  informative reports that are critical of the future of humanity and he put one
[07:41.120 --> 07:45.040]  together over the weekend that we're gonna play here in just a moment that
[07:45.040 --> 07:48.200]  needs to be seen and needs to be shared and then I've got some special guests
[07:48.200 --> 07:52.520]  I'm gonna tell you about from Australia who are joining us as it's the
[07:52.520 --> 07:57.200]  it's the break of dawn over there right now coming up here just a few minutes but
[07:57.200 --> 08:08.360]  in in in his report Bowne lays out the fact that the globalist admit that's the
[08:08.360 --> 08:13.720]  big corporation the big banks that they are establishing and that they are
[08:13.720 --> 08:19.840]  setting up a corporate world government that threw a chip under your skin in the
[08:19.840 --> 08:24.680]  future but currently through a digital face scan a digital hand scan or an app
[08:24.680 --> 08:28.360]  on your phone will tell you when you can leave your house can tell you where you
[08:28.360 --> 08:31.840]  can go can tell you what you can do and Mastercard and and all the other big
[08:31.840 --> 08:38.920]  credit card manufacturers and controllers all just came out and said we're
[08:38.920 --> 08:43.840]  going to limit what you can buy and how you can sell and basically cut your
[08:43.840 --> 08:48.760]  card off when you buy something that's not good for the environment unless you
[08:48.760 --> 08:53.160]  pay a carbon tax to the United Nations and the private banks that are setting
[08:53.160 --> 09:02.280]  this up I mean this is feudalism 2.0 this is just absolute total and complete
[09:02.280 --> 09:09.680]  tyranny and the name of the report is tyranny is just the beginning this
[09:09.680 --> 09:14.280]  tyranny is just the beginning and it lays it all out we're going to be playing
[09:14.280 --> 09:21.760]  it here in a moment but first I just want this to seek into everybody the
[09:21.760 --> 09:30.120]  magnitude and I say this all the time but just the absolute sheer historical
[09:30.120 --> 09:35.440]  magnitude of where we are right now and just let it sink in that a very
[09:35.440 --> 09:40.240]  predatory authoritarian world government is taking over and gaslighting the
[09:40.240 --> 09:47.280]  public and is in the process of establishing a worldwide ID to carry
[09:47.280 --> 09:53.600]  out the orderly impoverishment enslavement and then extermination of the
[09:53.600 --> 09:57.480]  vast majority of the human population and so we're going to witness something
[09:57.480 --> 10:06.280]  on the scale of human suffering and pain never before even seen or dreamt of on
[10:06.280 --> 10:12.560]  this planet so that is coming up and I just have all the other incredible side
[10:12.560 --> 10:17.280]  issues that feed into this like two federal boards the top board said do not
[10:17.280 --> 10:22.720]  do booster shots do not give under 16s the injections and Pfizer just waved
[10:22.720 --> 10:25.600]  one and said we're in charge you're gonna do it and it's out there bragging
[10:25.600 --> 10:30.720]  that's the case so that is coming up this is quite the report the tyranny is
[10:30.720 --> 10:36.560]  just the beginning the tyranny you're already witnessing is just the beginning
[10:36.560 --> 10:40.000]  and then we're going to come back and get into all the latest news and
[10:40.000 --> 10:45.000]  information in our world that feeds back to the globalist program of
[10:45.000 --> 10:51.480]  destabilization in the shutdown of human society so that is coming up here on
[10:51.480 --> 10:58.200]  the other side of this transmission and then we have Ricardo bossy that we just
[10:58.200 --> 11:02.600]  played a clip of in the first segment joining us here's the report
[11:03.600 --> 11:09.680]  Joe Biden's rambling misspoken speech at the United Nations was as transparent
[11:09.680 --> 11:14.000]  as it was a veiled message to the international order and global health
[11:14.000 --> 11:19.280]  threat and the and a global health threat council council toward global
[11:19.280 --> 11:24.000]  cobalt respond the global cobalt response vaccinating the world working
[11:24.000 --> 11:30.040]  with countries technologies that reduce the rest the risk similarly we know the
[11:30.040 --> 11:35.480]  bitter string of terrorism the bitter sting of terrorism is real heroic
[11:35.480 --> 11:40.320]  horrific violence climactic climate change ignoring his hand in the murder
[11:40.320 --> 11:45.720]  of 13 u.s. soldiers and an aid workers family and the impending doom of
[11:45.720 --> 11:51.520]  replacement migration while betraying our oldest ally France manual Macron is
[11:51.520 --> 11:56.120]  officially fuming he's you know he's not attending this u.n. summit and we
[11:56.120 --> 11:59.360]  don't really know what the state of affairs is even though they're sort of
[11:59.360 --> 12:03.800]  set to have some talk with Biden in the next few days Biden's poorly coded
[12:03.800 --> 12:08.520]  message predicted more pandemics to control the population will we work
[12:08.520 --> 12:14.880]  together to save lives defeat COVID-19 everywhere and take the necessary
[12:14.880 --> 12:19.360]  steps to prepare ourselves for the next pandemic where there will be another
[12:19.360 --> 12:24.560]  one and signal that the global carbon tax system is imminent when we meet the
[12:24.560 --> 12:29.040]  threat of challenging climate the challenging climate we're all feeling
[12:29.040 --> 12:36.840]  already ravaging every part of our world with extreme weather or will we suffer
[12:36.840 --> 12:41.920]  the merciless march of ever worsening droughts and floods more intense fires
[12:41.920 --> 12:49.120]  and hurricanes longer heat waves and rising seas agenda 2030 tyranny on
[12:49.120 --> 12:53.680]  steroids the recent report of intergovernmental panel on climate change
[12:53.680 --> 12:59.360]  was a code red for humanity we see the warning signs in every continent and
[12:59.360 --> 13:06.760]  region scorching temperatures shocking biodiversity loss polluted air water and
[13:06.760 --> 13:12.400]  natural spaces and climate related disasters at every turn the climate
[13:12.400 --> 13:16.920]  change rhetoric will accelerate piggybacking on the COVID lockdowns as
[13:16.920 --> 13:21.920]  climate change hysteria will saturate the remainder of the Biden administration
[13:21.920 --> 13:26.960]  occupation the climate crisis is not our fight alone is a global fight the
[13:26.960 --> 13:31.440]  president believes that what's in the infrastructure package is an important
[13:31.440 --> 13:36.520]  down payment on addressing what he sees as a crisis in our climate climate
[13:36.520 --> 13:41.920]  change poses an existential threat to our lives to our economy and the threat is
[13:41.920 --> 13:46.720]  here it's not going to get any better not some people Russia and China for
[13:46.720 --> 13:51.840]  example say well you know history tells us that he can make all the promises he
[13:51.840 --> 13:55.640]  wants for 2030 there's a good chance the republicans will be back in power by then
[13:55.640 --> 14:00.120]  and change everything well let me tell you why that won't happen because the
[14:00.120 --> 14:04.520]  major corporations of the world including in the United States are all
[14:04.520 --> 14:08.080]  moving in this direction and no politician is going to turn them around
[14:08.080 --> 14:12.120]  once they've committed trillions of dollars to this endeavor that's just not
[14:12.120 --> 14:17.520]  going to happen the normalization of contact tracing via COVID-19 apps and
[14:17.520 --> 14:22.240]  the expansion of the IRS and its reach into everyone's bank account will
[14:22.240 --> 14:27.400]  ensure the implementation of a similar carbon credit tracking system it will be
[14:27.400 --> 14:33.480]  known as a PCA a personal carbon allowance as a proposal was presented in
[14:33.480 --> 14:37.960]  the science journal nature by four environmental experts as a means of
[14:37.960 --> 14:43.000]  reducing global carbon emissions Paul Joseph Watson wrote everyone would be
[14:43.000 --> 14:47.640]  issued with a carbon allowance card that would entail all adults receiving an
[14:47.640 --> 14:53.520]  equal tradeable carbon allowance that reduces over time in line with national
[14:53.520 --> 14:58.840]  carbon targets the authors make it clear that the program would be a national
[14:58.840 --> 15:04.760]  mandatory policy also the uproar at the border where border patrol has made a
[15:04.760 --> 15:10.560]  record one millionth stop is merely the beginning as the State Department announced
[15:10.560 --> 15:16.120]  that it will increase its allotment of immigrants from 62,500 in the fiscal
[15:16.120 --> 15:24.640]  year of 2021 to 125,000 in 2022 while NGOs across the United States funnel the
[15:24.640 --> 15:29.760]  invasion into cities in red states including Florida Texas Missouri and
[15:29.760 --> 15:35.120]  Georgia Biden's approval will plummet but that's all just part of the plan we
[15:35.120 --> 15:41.560]  stand in my view at an inflection point in history and I'm here today to share
[15:41.560 --> 15:47.200]  with you how the United States tends to work with partners and allies to answer
[15:47.200 --> 15:52.600]  these questions I believe we in particularly you has an incredible
[15:52.600 --> 15:59.560]  window of opportunity to lead in shaping a new world order world order for the
[15:59.560 --> 16:05.400]  21st century John what was the most important point in Joe Biden's
[16:05.400 --> 16:11.640]  declaration of war against America on Thursday September 9 2021 was it the
[16:11.640 --> 16:16.360]  announcement of forced inoculations of 80 to 100 million Americans was it the
[16:16.360 --> 16:21.240]  announcement of federalization of all the major cities the bypassing of state
[16:21.240 --> 16:25.880]  governors the threat to basically remove them no it was that was all bad
[16:25.880 --> 16:31.440]  enough it's the fact that he's following a UN globalist great recent blueprint
[16:31.440 --> 16:36.440]  that Australia the UK Europe and the rest of Western world is and that this is
[16:36.440 --> 16:41.640]  just the beginning more lockdowns national medical IDs approved by the
[16:41.640 --> 16:46.640]  United Nations carbon taxes that don't just track and trace you and tax you but
[16:46.640 --> 16:49.880]  actually tell you when you can go somewhere and what you can do it's all
[16:49.880 --> 16:55.520]  been announced at the UN level this is a UN world government takeover corporate
[16:55.520 --> 17:00.440]  revolution through global governments it's illegal and Congress must stand up
[17:00.440 --> 17:04.800]  and stop it now I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last
[17:04.800 --> 17:08.520]  broadcast hell I've been on there 27 years and only the last year or so if I
[17:08.520 --> 17:12.080]  said that but let me tell you the new world orders breathe them down our neck
[17:12.080 --> 17:15.560]  the big globalist publications are coming after us and they're doing

[19:18.640 --> 19:23.720]  beings before there are no long-term studies we don't know what's going to
[19:23.720 --> 19:28.160]  happen inside your body somewhere four to six weeks after your second injection
[19:28.160 --> 19:34.760]  or four to six months or even two years we have no idea whether it's going to
[19:34.760 --> 19:39.320]  cause infertility whether it's going to cause cancer how bad your autoimmune
[19:39.320 --> 19:43.080]  disease is going to be my conclusion after looking at this for a long time
[19:43.080 --> 19:46.760]  and listening to the arguments for these masks I determined that if you believe
[19:46.760 --> 19:51.120]  if you're a medical doctor or a scientist that's spouting using these
[19:51.120 --> 19:55.440]  masks you're either being played or you're being paid secure your copy of
[19:55.440 --> 19:59.720]  Coventland today at Coventland.com if you order by October 6th you get a free
[19:59.720 --> 20:06.440]  copy of in-game blueprint for global enslavement. You're listening to the
[20:06.440 --> 20:20.920]  Alex Jones show. It's Sunday September 26th. We're live broadcasting worldwide.
[20:20.920 --> 20:33.520]  InfoWars the most banned network in the world. Okay thank you for joining us on
[20:33.520 --> 20:39.440]  this Sunday edition this happens a lot these days before I go on air I get so
[20:39.440 --> 20:43.000]  angry I can barely do the show and that's not good because I don't get all
[20:43.000 --> 20:46.000]  the news and information and it's not good because I'm our deal with for the
[20:46.000 --> 20:51.760]  crew and I apologize for that but you know I do not apologize for being deeply
[20:51.760 --> 20:57.480]  upset with what's happening in the world today. We are living in such an
[20:57.480 --> 21:02.800]  incredibly dangerous and historic time and we have the naked corporate world
[21:02.800 --> 21:10.360]  government abolishing every aspect of what is a free society and we have large
[21:10.360 --> 21:17.200]  groups of people standing up and saying no and not going along but they are met
[21:17.200 --> 21:25.600]  with just such a wall of corporate oppression and such a sea of liming like
[21:25.600 --> 21:32.800]  individuals going along with it that I shudder to think the world we're gonna
[21:32.800 --> 21:36.040]  live in not just our children because you're not gonna have to wait you know
[21:36.040 --> 21:39.480]  grandpa said if the world keeps going like this it's gonna be tough for your
[21:39.480 --> 21:43.320]  children well now it's the time of my children the time of your children and
[21:43.320 --> 21:51.080]  you don't have to wait anymore it's here and like putting a pot of water on the
[21:51.080 --> 21:54.800]  stove and turning the flame up on high it's gonna bubble at the bottom it's
[21:54.800 --> 21:59.520]  gonna start getting hot it's gonna come to a boil we now are starting to come to
[21:59.520 --> 22:05.000]  a boil so we're already in fabulous levels of oppression and tyranny and
[22:05.000 --> 22:11.200]  surveillance and control and giant Ponzi scheme banks just printing out
[22:11.200 --> 22:17.200]  quadrillions in fiat currency that they give to themselves to then buy up all
[22:17.200 --> 22:22.160]  the infrastructure and when they can't buy up every single piece of property
[22:22.160 --> 22:25.680]  because some won't sell they cut the world economy off with the global
[22:25.680 --> 22:30.640]  lockdown so that they have a pretext to go in and force you to sell and then to
[22:30.640 --> 22:35.440]  dictate to your family and yourself through the new carbon apps that are
[22:35.440 --> 22:38.480]  gonna be on all the phones they've announced and that all credit cards are
[22:38.480 --> 22:43.360]  connected to to then artificially make you poor so that you can be their
[22:43.360 --> 22:48.760]  slave I mean this is just absolute total and complete bondage that we're going
[22:48.760 --> 22:57.240]  into and I saw a individual that has one of the independent nationalist
[22:57.240 --> 23:03.160]  populist parties Ricardo bossy doing some good work over in Australia speaking
[23:03.160 --> 23:07.840]  up against the level of absolute oppression there under that is the
[23:07.840 --> 23:11.440]  beta test the rest of the world so I thought our focus on Australia would be
[23:11.440 --> 23:18.040]  really informative we've got him on with us so it's sunrise where he's at and
[23:18.040 --> 23:23.320]  he'll be joining us from the other side of the world coming up the start of the
[23:23.320 --> 23:30.160]  next segment Australia one party dot com and you can see his very important
[23:30.160 --> 23:36.760]  video that we've been really pushing and promoting a war for the world at man dot
[23:36.760 --> 23:42.200]  video so I look forward to having him on with us and then we have some other
[23:42.200 --> 23:47.000]  folks a political prisoner and others joining us later in the next hour who've
[23:47.000 --> 23:51.280]  been locked up for peacefully protesting against the ongoing lockdown so
[23:51.280 --> 23:56.560]  there's the video of your TV viewer a war for the world let me do this right
[23:56.560 --> 24:02.720]  now let me just hit some headlines for you on the whole COVID tyranny takeover
[24:02.720 --> 24:08.000]  just to give you an idea where we are currently at Pfizer CEO says CDC decision
[24:08.000 --> 24:13.760]  to boost boosters against recommendations of top scientists panels a
[24:13.760 --> 24:19.520]  very good idea you said that on ABC news today read that to you again you see the
[24:19.520 --> 24:27.360]  video at m4s.com Pfizer CEO says CDC's decision to push boosters against
[24:27.360 --> 24:33.160]  recommendations of top scientific panels a very good idea a very good one he
[24:33.160 --> 24:41.480]  said now that's the CDC panel and the FDA panel that are scientists and
[24:41.480 --> 24:46.640]  virologists who were put there under statutory law to basically make sure
[24:46.640 --> 24:53.120]  there's oversight that has been overridden and Fauci says and Pfizer
[24:53.120 --> 24:59.320]  says around Halloween they're gonna announce down to two-year-olds are gonna
[24:59.320 --> 25:04.160]  get the shot even though the FDA scientists quit that are over that even
[25:04.160 --> 25:08.200]  though the CDC scientists have gone public even though two FDA boards and a
[25:08.200 --> 25:12.600]  CDC board have come out and said this vaccine isn't a vaccine it doesn't work
[25:12.600 --> 25:15.920]  the drug is failing it's causing a lot of heart attacks and heart swelling and
[25:15.920 --> 25:19.800]  blood clots and all these shots are really bad and we need to pull these
[25:19.800 --> 25:23.520]  back and England yellow carded the vaccine but there is advisory group
[25:23.520 --> 25:26.560]  saying pull it but they still went forward but the same story all over the
[25:26.560 --> 25:31.480]  world where this is happening Australia New Zealand Europe the UK Canada the US
[25:31.480 --> 25:37.600]  the regulators are all whoa this is really bad they're like you're just the
[25:37.600 --> 25:42.840]  top scientist even though these are pro-vax people bought and paid for by
[25:42.840 --> 25:47.560]  Big Pharma they've gone whoa whoa whoa this is gonna discredit vaccines for
[25:47.560 --> 25:52.800]  generations that's a quote by the chief scientist but the FDA that quit three
[25:52.800 --> 25:57.440]  weeks ago and then the panels voted the way they said they should and they got
[25:57.440 --> 26:01.200]  overridden and that's why that the two top scientists number one number two at
[26:01.200 --> 26:08.360]  this FDA quit three weeks ago is they were told when the boards say this
[26:08.360 --> 26:13.000]  shouldn't be given we're gonna override them they said the political hack who's
[26:13.000 --> 26:16.840]  not even a doctor at the White House is gonna override they said yes and the
[26:16.840 --> 26:21.520]  head of Pfizer he's your president he's your god he's your doctor you know your
[26:21.520 --> 26:28.720]  doctor can't make you do something he can and he is so that's why Fauci came out
[26:28.720 --> 26:33.320]  three weeks ago when those two FDA scientists quit and said well that's
[26:33.320 --> 26:39.880]  nice but it will be approved and you will give it to babies as well because he
[26:39.880 --> 26:47.080]  knew they don't care they run things it's tyranny they know that the vaccine
[26:47.080 --> 26:51.280]  creates a spike protein in your body that is what is the COVID-19 and makes
[26:51.280 --> 26:57.080]  you sick they know it causes autoimmune disorders they know people that take two
[26:57.080 --> 27:03.800]  to three shots of this garbage within a cold season or two or three max will
[27:03.800 --> 27:07.760]  come in contact with a regular coronavirus and have a horrible auto
[27:07.760 --> 27:14.280]  immune attack again they used to grow starting in the 70s some vaccines on
[27:14.280 --> 27:17.720]  peanut protein and you got millions of people for the first time in history
[27:17.720 --> 27:22.160]  violently allergic to peanuts the first time after they had the inoculation they
[27:22.160 --> 27:25.680]  get a little sick but mom would feed it to him over and over again and finally if
[27:25.680 --> 27:31.880]  they took about a peanut they die it's the same thing and I that scientist on
[27:31.880 --> 27:34.920]  describe it there's a bunch different disorders but they could never make a
[27:34.920 --> 27:40.520]  cold virus vaccine that's what this is because there's too many of them and it
[27:40.520 --> 27:45.680]  makes your body later freak out just like a bee sting that's your body having
[27:45.680 --> 27:51.560]  an immune response and so that's why the scientists say within two or three years
[27:51.560 --> 27:58.280]  you're gonna see mass death just from the autoimmune response that's what kill
[27:58.280 --> 28:02.480]  most people the Spanish flu back during the end of World War one was not the
[28:02.480 --> 28:07.560]  virus but just the body's incredible overreaction to it freaking out that's
[28:07.560 --> 28:13.320]  why with COVID-19 you take steroids inhalable and your corticotipic pills
[28:13.320 --> 28:18.640]  anti-inflammatory and that's why it deals with it most the time of its early
[28:18.640 --> 28:23.600]  because it's an autoimmune response well if you think that's bad you wait
[28:23.600 --> 28:28.320]  down the road and they know this and then even the FDA scientists and CDC
[28:28.320 --> 28:33.280]  scientists and UK scientists are like hey we better EU scientists we better not
[28:33.280 --> 28:37.440]  do this better stop they're like shut up with your boards that used to be in
[28:37.440 --> 28:43.600]  charge Pfizer and Moderna that's DARPA they say fools be ahead and and Owen
[28:43.600 --> 28:48.800]  talk about Australia they're under lockdown for like 500 and something days
[28:48.800 --> 28:54.920]  coming up on 600 and that's what's coming here next Australia is tomorrow's
[28:54.920 --> 29:00.720]  tyranny today this is hardcore stay with us
[29:02.560 --> 29:08.080]  generally it's general Millie I just want you to know that Trump tried to
[29:08.080 --> 29:12.880]  overthrow the US government two days ago on January 6th and I just want you to
[29:12.880 --> 29:15.920]  know I've taken control of the nuclear weapons and if Trump tries to launch an
[29:15.920 --> 29:20.720]  attack on you will let you know first the attacks coming that is from the
[29:20.720 --> 29:25.960]  transcript then he called up Pelosi Schumer and others to say I'm loyal to
[29:25.960 --> 29:29.760]  you I'm gonna protect Trump from using nuclear weapons when Trump was going for
[29:29.760 --> 29:33.080]  Daytona with China and North Korea at the time and Trump's responded saying
[29:33.080 --> 29:37.040]  it's a total lie Pelosi's come out and admitted it happened hell she bragged back
[29:37.040 --> 29:42.120]  on January 8th that it took place then and is saying that she honors Millie and
[29:42.120 --> 29:45.720]  he's this courageous person so are all these other Democrats so this is the
[29:45.720 --> 29:49.520]  permanent deep-state coup that's been in control for a long time now coming out
[29:49.520 --> 29:53.320]  of the shadows publicly remember these people literally hate you and your
[29:53.320 --> 29:58.400]  family now they're injecting you with poison soft-kill injections wake up
[29:58.400 --> 30:04.600]  America or be destroyed we've all heard about the pastor in his famous
[30:04.600 --> 30:09.160]  statement from inside a concentration camp in World War two that when they
[30:09.160 --> 30:12.400]  came for one group he wasn't part of that group so you didn't stand up and
[30:12.400 --> 30:15.160]  then when they came for another group he wasn't part of that group so you didn't
[30:15.160 --> 30:20.040]  stand up and finally when they came for him those nobody else to stand up
[30:20.040 --> 30:23.520]  all the global social credit score that China's putting in that's banning people
[30:23.520 --> 30:26.960]  the three hours of video games a week and if you criticize the government you
[30:26.960 --> 30:30.800]  can never buy or sell again well that's that's being brought here all over the
[30:30.800 --> 30:35.080]  world under the guise of COVID vaccine passports they even admit it now
[30:35.080 --> 30:38.440]  Thursday is going to be a carbon tax attached to it they're gonna track where
[30:38.440 --> 30:42.400]  you go what you do and decide where you can go and what you can do that's what
[30:42.400 --> 30:47.320]  the lockdowns are about you'll accept that you'll accept anything so again the
[30:47.320 --> 30:50.960]  left is having fun right now all the censorship and tyranny pretending like
[30:50.960 --> 30:53.800]  they're part of the power structure but they're all gonna be targeted by this
[30:53.800 --> 30:57.760]  nightmare as well we need to get back to basic human rights and promote them or
[30:57.760 --> 31:00.600]  all of us will be enslaved by this horrible technocracy run by the
[31:00.600 --> 31:05.280]  globalists so when I first started taking survival skills basically I was
[31:05.280 --> 31:10.120]  275 pounds overweight I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe I was barely
[31:10.120 --> 31:14.080]  holding on to a job and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it so
[31:14.080 --> 31:17.880]  the first one I got was the original survival shield the X1 and it worked
[31:17.880 --> 31:21.240]  pretty good and then shortly thereafter you came out with that too you have you
[31:21.240 --> 31:24.080]  know with a deep burden source you know and I got really excited about that so I
[31:24.080 --> 31:29.040]  took it and man in two weeks I went from brain fog to like literally like my
[31:29.040 --> 31:33.720]  brain was enlightened you know I could think again I could connect with people
[31:33.720 --> 31:37.800]  again and over the course of the next couple of years I got my health back
[31:37.800 --> 31:41.040]  and I religiously take basically all of your supplements there they're all
[31:41.040 --> 31:45.400]  absolutely amazing supplements the one I like recently is knockout it literally
[31:45.400 --> 31:48.960]  like if you want to sleep just take it it's amazing it works but anyway so the
[31:48.960 --> 31:52.920]  point is we have to get ourselves clean that's a break free of the globalist
[31:52.920 --> 31:56.800]  system and the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hand
[31:56.800 --> 32:01.280]  beautifully said brother I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed
[32:01.280 --> 32:06.800]  I'll tell you what's life and death if you don't have freedom of speech if you
[32:06.800 --> 32:11.600]  don't have the right to communicate then you don't have a future always when
[32:11.600 --> 32:14.920]  governments take away speech they then enslave the population and then they
[32:14.920 --> 32:18.280]  finally start exterminating the population and America the entire world
[32:18.280 --> 32:22.800]  is going down the tubes because the UN globals directed great reset that's why
[32:22.800 --> 32:26.000]  it's more important than ever that info or stay on the air and that all of us

[33:03.920 --> 33:09.320]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[33:14.760 --> 33:22.200]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop
[33:22.200 --> 33:29.640]  tyranny well so does he live from the info wars dot com studios it's Alex
[33:29.640 --> 33:37.360]  Jones all right it is 7 30 a.m. in the morning in Sydney Australia one of the
[33:37.360 --> 33:42.320]  locked down areas there in southern Australia and Ricardo bossy is the real
[33:42.320 --> 33:48.160]  deal he was a commander a nationally of the SAS during the whole Kuwait operations
[33:48.160 --> 33:53.680]  and he is a well-known corporate advisor and leader in Australia I'm not gonna go
[33:53.680 --> 33:59.320]  over at all but he heads up Australia one party Australia one party dot com and
[33:59.320 --> 34:03.200]  I was already familiar with who he was because I follow world politics all over
[34:03.200 --> 34:07.600]  the planet especially quote Western style countries I've certainly wanted to
[34:07.600 --> 34:10.600]  visit Australia before I have a lot of listeners there but then I saw a very
[34:10.600 --> 34:16.800]  powerful video that we put out last week with added pieces of news and video
[34:16.800 --> 34:21.600]  clips of a statement he made about the fact that there is a war happening right
[34:21.600 --> 34:28.960]  now for the world you can see that report at band on video right now a war for
[34:28.960 --> 34:32.920]  the world and again Greg Reese one of our great editors added some video in
[34:32.920 --> 34:37.440]  context what he was saying but Australia is where we're going to be it's where
[34:37.440 --> 34:41.400]  Canada already is partially it's where Europe is and I have claus wobb zone
[34:41.400 --> 34:44.840]  documents I have Bill Gates own documents where they admit this is their
[34:44.840 --> 34:52.080]  planetary takeover but Ricardo bossy with his whole special forces background
[34:52.080 --> 34:58.000]  and global connections has really great gravitas to speak to this and
[34:58.000 --> 35:02.440]  specifically with the terrible things the Australian police are doing now
[35:02.440 --> 35:06.800]  backed up by the military this year is basically a once free beautiful nation
[35:06.800 --> 35:10.760]  turning into North Korea in my view and again it's the same global forces doing
[35:10.760 --> 35:14.720]  it so thank you for joining us Ricardo it's great to have you here and please
[35:14.720 --> 35:20.360]  give us the latest of what's happening to the land down under hi Alex thank you
[35:20.360 --> 35:24.800]  very much for your kind invitation and before we kick off let me just thank you
[35:24.800 --> 35:30.680]  for your fearless and heroic pursuit of the truth it's been nearly three decades
[35:30.680 --> 35:35.200]  for you so this has been a long haul so thank you so much so what's happening
[35:35.200 --> 35:40.680]  down down under what you're witnessing is the rebirth of a moral
[35:40.680 --> 35:46.920]  sovereign and self-aligned nation we got to focus on this the right way we know
[35:46.920 --> 35:51.880]  exactly what's going on look as a soldier I always ask people a simple
[35:51.880 --> 35:56.160]  question is the history of mankind the history of peace punctuated by war is
[35:56.160 --> 36:00.720]  it or is it the history of war punctuated by peace and depending on how you
[36:00.720 --> 36:06.360]  answer that question will reveal to you your view and knowledge of history now
[36:06.360 --> 36:11.720]  I'm a soldier so I know that the history of mankind is constant war punctuated
[36:11.720 --> 36:15.160]  by periods of peace because the right people step up and do the right thing
[36:15.160 --> 36:18.680]  so please understand what you are witnessing what the world is witnessing
[36:18.680 --> 36:24.240]  is the rebirth of a moral sovereign and self-reliant nation it's as simple as
[36:24.240 --> 36:28.840]  that now it's hurt it's gonna hurt there's there's gonna be some pain but if we
[36:28.840 --> 36:32.440]  see this the right way we'll see exactly what the opportunity is the moment we
[36:32.440 --> 36:36.320]  get fearful the moment we think we're gonna lose we lose the moment we know
[36:36.320 --> 36:40.400]  we're gonna win we win because that's what happens in a fight there's two
[36:40.400 --> 36:45.960]  two two boxes going at it and the one that decides it's gonna lose does well
[36:45.960 --> 36:48.840]  we're not doing that we know exactly what we're doing we have a plan we're
[36:48.840 --> 36:53.240]  working the plan we're being very careful about it but the way I described
[36:53.240 --> 36:59.800]  that in that piece was nonviolent non-corporation the moral victory that
[36:59.800 --> 37:04.920]  we need to have in Australia and show the rest of the world what can and must
[37:04.920 --> 37:11.480]  be done and so there's a short intro this is a war without doubt but it is the
[37:11.480 --> 37:15.800]  rebirth of our nation well you're right it's the rebirth I totally agree with you
[37:15.800 --> 37:19.680]  because the globalists say that they say Bolsonaro the awakening in Europe and
[37:19.680 --> 37:23.760]  the US and the UK and Briggs it and Australia demanding its liberty and
[37:23.760 --> 37:28.520]  nationalist and patriot parties gaining more and more support this whole
[37:28.520 --> 37:32.640]  worldwide lockdown operation lockstep by the Rockefeller Foundation the UN and
[37:32.640 --> 37:36.960]  their own admission is to counter the populist uprising they see happening and
[37:36.960 --> 37:41.160]  and so we have to see this as an opportunity and as the old corrupt
[37:41.160 --> 37:45.360]  system in crisis I agree with you so I get a period list all these terrible
[37:45.360 --> 37:48.520]  scary things and some of people think I'm trying to scare folks no I believe
[37:48.520 --> 37:51.600]  that once people are faced by the evil they'll want to stand up and do
[37:51.600 --> 37:56.000]  something about it and that's exactly it and this is where the globalists have
[37:56.000 --> 38:00.080]  misread the Australian people because they think the Anglophone world is
[38:00.080 --> 38:03.560]  this amorphous mass that responds identically and we don't we're very
[38:03.560 --> 38:08.320]  very different and what they see as complacency in the Australian people is
[38:08.320 --> 38:12.440]  actually just a resilience this is a hard country and you've got to be hard to
[38:12.440 --> 38:16.480]  take it you can't afford to jump at every shadow and so they see this this
[38:16.480 --> 38:22.160]  complacency is as they see our lack of movement as complacency it's not it's
[38:22.160 --> 38:27.640]  just resilience we are slow to anger as a people we are very slow to anger we're
[38:27.640 --> 38:33.080]  very tolerant people but I can tell you when an Australian gets their blood up
[38:33.080 --> 38:38.240]  it'll start and we're beginning to see it now now the key point here is we have
[38:38.240 --> 38:43.000]  to win this for ourselves we can't outsource this any further and just like
[38:43.000 --> 38:48.760]  in the analogy I use when I'm talking to my people is it's similar to D-Day we
[38:48.760 --> 38:53.640]  have to take Normandy now the day we land on Normandy we're gonna need a lot
[38:53.640 --> 38:58.280]  of troops you got no I don't care how good your six people are you can't take
[38:58.280 --> 39:02.360]  Normandy beaches with that with six people you need big numbers and the
[39:02.360 --> 39:06.400]  analogy I use is if a thousand turn up we have a problem if ten thousand turn up
[39:06.400 --> 39:09.680]  the police have a problem if a hundred thousand turn up then the politicians
[39:09.680 --> 39:12.720]  have got a problem if a million turn up we win because there are not enough
[39:12.720 --> 39:16.200]  police there are not enough prisons to lock us up so we got we've got to take
[39:16.200 --> 39:19.600]  Normandy beach now having taken the beach doesn't mean that we're going to be
[39:19.600 --> 39:24.400]  in Berlin by next week this has been an exquisitely designed and executed
[39:24.400 --> 39:28.800]  strategy over decades decades and decades and decades and we have evidence
[39:28.800 --> 39:33.520]  of that just like you have evidence we we like our evidence to there's a
[39:33.520 --> 39:38.960]  document from 1980 from the Australian Senate a Senate inquiry into the
[39:38.960 --> 39:43.280]  implications for Australia of the new international economic order and the
[39:43.280 --> 39:48.520]  book is quite quite clear the report they wrote February 1980 that we are
[39:48.520 --> 39:52.080]  fully engaged in the Australian nation apparently is it fully engaged and
[39:52.080 --> 39:56.200]  they're going to use every tool at their disposal personalities the news media
[39:56.200 --> 40:00.160]  the unions everybody has to promote this new international economic order which
[40:00.160 --> 40:05.120]  as you know which was just one of the steps down the path and so this this
[40:05.120 --> 40:09.400]  very delicately very exquisitely designed and execute strategy has
[40:09.400 --> 40:15.440]  penetrated every aspect and every arm of the government and so it's going to take
[40:15.440 --> 40:20.280]  us time to get through this but once we get on that beach at Normandy that's
[40:20.280 --> 40:23.360]  the tow hold once we get there we start moving across and the people are
[40:23.360 --> 40:29.840]  learning that and to quote a famous American Oliver Wendell Holmes their
[40:29.840 --> 40:34.240]  hearts are being touched with fire for the first time the Australian people
[40:34.240 --> 40:38.760]  have to fight for their country on their land now that's common around the world
[40:38.760 --> 40:44.320]  it really is but for us no we've been we're very fortunate now they upside of
[40:44.320 --> 40:47.960]  having a good quiet life is it doesn't make for the toughest of people but they
[40:47.960 --> 40:52.800]  are learning fast and that that fire that's touching the Australian hearts
[40:52.800 --> 40:58.720]  the rest of the world can see what we are doing and we will win this
[40:58.720 --> 41:05.360]  peacefully and we must because if if we had the arms which were taken from us
[41:05.360 --> 41:09.040]  courtesy of one of our prime ministers after what has been called the false flag
[41:09.040 --> 41:14.240]  operation of Port Arthur the the damage it would do to us as a nation to take
[41:14.240 --> 41:19.160]  up arms against each other is something we don't necessarily want so we want to
[41:19.160 --> 41:23.440]  do this peacefully peacefully and we want to do this morally because that will
[41:23.440 --> 41:26.560]  allow us to win the piece that follows and then this is just as critical to
[41:26.560 --> 41:30.360]  winning this war now we're going to win this war of that I have no doubt we have
[41:30.360 --> 41:34.040]  the numbers we have the strategy with the plan with the people we can win this
[41:34.040 --> 41:39.400]  because they cannot win without our consent and we're waking up but once
[41:39.400 --> 41:44.800]  the war is won we need to immediately transition into rebuilding and reforming
[41:44.800 --> 41:47.960]  this nation and Australia once already got that plan we're working on it we've
[41:47.960 --> 41:51.720]  been working on it for some time so this this seamless transition from water
[41:51.720 --> 41:56.760]  peace is what we're working on so it's going to be a great example for the rest
[41:56.760 --> 42:00.600]  of the world to follow because as you say I think you're right we are the test
[42:00.600 --> 42:05.960]  case but the globalists have misread us badly they go for an intelligent and
[42:05.960 --> 42:10.320]  well-designed plan these buffoons these imbeciles these moral
[42:10.320 --> 42:14.840]  critons have misread their adversary badly they should read a bit of Sun
[42:14.840 --> 42:18.920]  sir I think but they've misread Australia and they've misread the world and they
[42:18.920 --> 42:22.760]  will lose it's only a matter of time when we come back Ricardo bossy
[42:22.760 --> 42:27.360]  Australian one-party.com is going to continue to lay out what's really
[42:27.360 --> 42:30.440]  happening in Australia and again the rest of the world because this is a test
[42:30.440 --> 42:35.480]  the UN admits it it's in all their statements so is Europe so is the UK
[42:35.480 --> 42:39.720]  so is Canada and you're now seeing this come here so we're gonna talk about the
[42:39.720 --> 42:43.640]  fact that this is globalist and of the people of Australia or America anywhere
[42:43.640 --> 42:47.760]  else understand this is an outside foreign takeover they will unify against
[42:47.760 --> 42:51.560]  it but when it gets like puppets like Biden or their public prime minister
[42:51.560 --> 42:54.800]  there you have to understand they're just front people you must unify and
[42:54.800 --> 42:58.960]  understand the lockdowns are directed by Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates they are the
[42:58.960 --> 43:06.720]  enemy. You want to have a double-blind randomized placebo testing without what
[43:06.720 --> 43:11.920]  that means you give 20,000 people the vaccine when it comes to phase two phase
[43:11.920 --> 43:18.040]  three trials and you give 20,000 people a placebo and then you really look at
[43:18.040 --> 43:23.040]  health outcomes for a long period of time not four weeks a lot of these
[43:23.040 --> 43:26.760]  injuries the autoimmune injuries you're not gonna see in four weeks the
[43:26.760 --> 43:30.840]  cancer you're not gonna see in four weeks and many of the neurological
[43:30.840 --> 43:35.400]  injuries you won't see for four weeks if the experience with other vaccines is
[43:35.400 --> 43:39.720]  instructive you look at the other vaccines that are currently in the
[43:39.720 --> 43:46.160]  schedule and there's about 400 injuries illnesses chronic illnesses that are
[43:46.160 --> 43:51.680]  listed. Robert Kennedy Jr. is just one of more than 40 powerful voices in the film

[44:18.120 --> 44:23.160]  else doesn't get attention and he's be looked at is vitamin B12 it is just as

[47:00.520 --> 47:03.560]  products please take action
[47:03.560 --> 47:09.960]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:24.760 --> 47:28.360]  a lot of people say where's the military where's the veterans where's the
[47:28.360 --> 47:31.920]  generals well look at balsamaro taking his country back and saying we're under
[47:31.920 --> 47:36.440]  globalist attack they control big pharma they're trying to enslave us that's
[47:36.440 --> 47:40.360]  really what's happening Trump did that to a certain extent Horace Johnson acted
[47:40.360 --> 47:44.000]  like he was a patriot but turned out to be a double agent maybe they had too much
[47:44.000 --> 47:47.640]  dirt on him but Ricardo bossy is a great leader over in Australia's top man
[47:47.640 --> 47:51.440]  they fear he's an author speaker consultant and former Australian Army
[47:51.440 --> 47:55.640]  special forces lieutenant colonel have has successfully been selected for the
[47:55.640 --> 47:59.760]  Australian special air services regiment Ricardo went to be appointed
[47:59.760 --> 48:03.680]  national commander the Australian SAS forces in Kuwait as well as the director
[48:03.680 --> 48:07.000]  of future capability development in headquarters special operations amongst
[48:07.000 --> 48:10.000]  others so just like general Flynn here fighting back as well because he sees a
[48:10.000 --> 48:13.600]  threat as well as consulting and it goes on from there all the things advising
[48:13.600 --> 48:17.440]  the military the Australian government so he's in a perfect position to say to
[48:17.440 --> 48:21.240]  the police and military what are you doing but notice it's leftist controlled
[48:21.240 --> 48:24.920]  cities that are showing the example for the rest of Australia and then the
[48:24.920 --> 48:28.720]  example of the world just like leftist cities have done some similar things here
[48:28.720 --> 48:32.480]  but the rebellion was so great they had to back off so laying this out I want to
[48:32.480 --> 48:38.800]  explain everybody Australia is tomorrow's tyranny today this is an exact
[48:38.800 --> 48:42.920]  blueprint as you've already laid out that's why their fight is our fight so
[48:42.920 --> 48:46.600]  this isn't like oh we just care about Australia now I care about my family and
[48:46.600 --> 48:49.600]  the country in the whole world and we defeat the globalist in one Western
[48:49.600 --> 48:54.120]  country we'll defeat them everywhere or if the Australia falls like dominoes we
[48:54.120 --> 49:00.640]  will fall so Colonel please continue laying the software people sure just
[49:00.640 --> 49:04.640]  before you left the last segment you mentioned about the the leadership of
[49:04.640 --> 49:07.640]  the Western world being puppets and you're exactly right and it is a little
[49:07.640 --> 49:12.040]  frustrating hearing people say Biden said this and Morrison did that and Dan
[49:12.040 --> 49:16.360]  Andrews who's our Victorian Premier which is like your state governor these
[49:16.360 --> 49:20.360]  people couldn't find a beer in a brewery I mean they're gross so grossly
[49:20.360 --> 49:24.680]  competent exactly and so even the language that people use when we when
[49:24.680 --> 49:29.320]  the mainstream media and even the critics of the the leadership use their
[49:29.320 --> 49:33.840]  names it's not them they are puppets we know their puppets they're imbeciles
[49:33.840 --> 49:37.000]  it's the party machine and behind the party machine you've got the backers
[49:37.000 --> 49:39.960]  behind the backers you've got the real power brokers and as you know there are
[49:39.960 --> 49:44.200]  several layers so we've got to really build a cat here and understand that these
[49:44.200 --> 49:48.240]  these fools aren't running the show every and the way I put it to our people
[49:48.240 --> 49:52.600]  because what they are doing to us in a real sense is they want to foment a
[49:52.600 --> 49:58.160]  rebellion and and they're very good at this they want us to react in a in a
[49:58.160 --> 50:02.440]  violent way that's exactly what they're after they'll give them the excuse to get
[50:02.440 --> 50:07.760]  it in more violent now in analyzing an enemy's actions you try to see some
[50:07.760 --> 50:11.400]  underlying logic and there is one but it's not obvious to them because people
[50:11.400 --> 50:14.400]  keep saying to me why are the police so rough why don't you know why they're
[50:14.400 --> 50:20.000]  bashing up women on the street why are they why are they spraying old ladies
[50:20.000 --> 50:25.560]  in the street they want the response the globalist want us to push back in a
[50:25.560 --> 50:32.880]  violent way once that happens they will come down even harder it's it is as
[50:32.880 --> 50:36.520]  clear as day and that's why with this our whole response must be predicated on
[50:36.520 --> 50:40.840]  nonviolent non-cooperation because we can bring them to a halt 24 million people
[50:40.840 --> 50:44.200]  and let's say there's a million crooks in the place that leaves 24 million of us
[50:44.200 --> 50:48.360]  which is less than a tenth of the United States population but about the same
[50:48.360 --> 50:54.440]  area if we just stood and said no we just refuse to play the game we'll still
[50:54.440 --> 50:58.600]  still be law-abiding citizens we'll still do what we've got to do but we just
[50:58.600 --> 51:02.040]  won't play the game anymore there's not enough police to help now the other
[51:02.040 --> 51:05.800]  good part is the police are cracking and so the doctors and so the lawyers is
[51:05.800 --> 51:10.000]  that the wedge has started and so once again the globalists have missed out
[51:10.000 --> 51:16.120]  they're trying to foment this rebellion and and so subtle is their plan for
[51:16.120 --> 51:20.320]  example the the idea of a corporate entity which is Australia and a corporate
[51:20.320 --> 51:23.760]  entity which is the Queen of Australia there is some truth to that there's
[51:23.760 --> 51:27.280]  also a lot of misinformation because they're trying to g up all sorts of
[51:27.280 --> 51:32.200]  different responses to it and so what we try to do is we try to stay above that
[51:32.200 --> 51:36.720]  the nonsense detail and just focus on what's got to be done and what's got to
[51:36.720 --> 51:40.760]  be done is the people have to we got to build our army and my people get tired
[51:40.760 --> 51:44.320]  of hearing me say you got one priority folks build the army build the army
[51:44.320 --> 51:48.200]  build the army so when the word comes down and we land on the beaches of
[51:48.200 --> 51:54.360]  Normandy we just flood every square inch with peaceful Australians saying no
[51:54.360 --> 51:58.600]  consent no consent and mr. bossy let's explain how this works for people that
[51:58.600 --> 52:01.680]  don't know you're historically totally right because we put your video out it
[52:01.680 --> 52:06.600]  got 600,000 views on our side 500,000 views and and millions around the
[52:06.600 --> 52:10.280]  web once we amplified it was already popular in Australia and fools saw it
[52:10.280 --> 52:13.800]  and said one of two things yeah he's right let's start killing or they said
[52:13.800 --> 52:17.240]  oh look he's like you he's trying to get people to be violent no you were very
[52:17.240 --> 52:22.800]  clear you said no consent no consent no consent Mahatma Gandhi Martin Luther
[52:22.800 --> 52:28.160]  King jr. copying Jesus Christ that is what we're talking about and then when
[52:28.160 --> 52:33.600]  they cracked the heads it hurts them not getting a physical war going which
[52:33.600 --> 52:37.720]  destabilizes and collapses the country for several years then they come in as
[52:37.720 --> 52:40.880]  the savior overthrow the government the globalist put in their new government
[52:40.880 --> 52:45.360]  Klaus Schwab has written books on this the UN talks about we got IMF World Bank
[52:45.360 --> 52:50.200]  documents in 2002 the BBC did red palace where they were planning all over the
[52:50.200 --> 52:54.440]  world to foment revolutions they controlled then collapse things they'll
[52:54.440 --> 52:58.000]  put a communist revolution in for 10 years and then bring in something after
[52:58.000 --> 53:02.360]  it so so that's what they're trying to do we have to understand the larger plan
[53:02.360 --> 53:07.240]  unify Americans unify Australians unify all countries against the corporate
[53:07.240 --> 53:11.920]  globalist using simple behavioral psychology so we pull up at the 30,000
[53:11.920 --> 53:15.280]  foot view we'll then understand it but if we keep just thinking bring a new
[53:15.280 --> 53:19.400]  puppet in bring a puppet out we're gonna continue to fail we've got to see the
[53:19.400 --> 53:22.680]  whole hidden image and once we see the image you can't unsee it is that what
[53:22.680 --> 53:27.400]  you're saying exactly correct thank you you put that very well and that's why
[53:27.400 --> 53:32.280]  one of the read one of our primary objectives once part of our plan to
[53:32.280 --> 53:36.200]  reform the nation and and let me just let me just read this to you because if
[53:36.200 --> 53:39.400]  this is critical in terms of understanding our understanding of the
[53:39.400 --> 53:43.080]  problem and therefore the solution our purpose is to save Australia just like
[53:43.080 --> 53:47.720]  your job is to save the United States so it's very clear to save Australia how
[53:47.720 --> 53:51.480]  are we going to do that we're going to create a moral political force that
[53:51.480 --> 53:55.160]  empowers Australians to reach their highest individual potential so that
[53:55.160 --> 53:58.760]  collectively all can participate in the reformation of Australia now this is
[53:58.760 --> 54:04.760]  key because this creates a foundation of strong willed strongly minded
[54:04.760 --> 54:09.440]  individuals who then build the nation from the ground up and that way they
[54:09.440 --> 54:13.960]  cannot impose anything upon us ever again now you the United States has been
[54:13.960 --> 54:19.400]  through their revolution we haven't and so this is why it's brand new for us but
[54:19.400 --> 54:23.280]  then we're working towards an end state now this is all military planning and
[54:23.280 --> 54:26.920]  that's the I love the way the military does business it is just
[54:26.920 --> 54:31.760]  unemotional this isn't a not a marketing statement this is a an end state a
[54:31.760 --> 54:35.520]  checklist that we must achieve so after empowering individuals to reach their
[54:35.520 --> 54:40.560]  highest individual potential and then collectively assisting to reform the
[54:40.560 --> 54:45.160]  country from the ground up this is what we want to create Australia as a moral
[54:45.160 --> 54:49.560]  sovereign self-reliant Christian Western democracy which is economically
[54:49.560 --> 54:54.440]  powerful militarily intimidating politically free culturally vibrant
[54:54.440 --> 54:58.600]  and socially cohesive and that's what we're building so every step that we
[54:58.600 --> 55:02.320]  take on this journey from where we are to where we're going to be has to
[55:02.320 --> 55:07.560]  contribute directly to that end state if it doesn't it's out and and and creating
[55:07.560 --> 55:13.840]  a wound in the Australian psyche of a civil war is something that never really
[55:13.840 --> 55:19.640]  deals and it's one that prudent leadership demands we avoided all costs now if we
[55:19.640 --> 55:23.680]  have to defend ourselves I have no problem with that my natural instinct as a
[55:23.680 --> 55:30.440]  soldier is to squeeze the trigger I get it all right we lost his connection to
[55:30.440 --> 55:36.200]  the land down under where it's 755 central we will reconnect with him and
[55:36.200 --> 55:40.960]  get him on to lay the side of when he's saying Australia you think America you
[55:40.960 --> 55:45.120]  think United Kingdom you think Germany you think Mexico you think Spain you
[55:45.120 --> 55:50.000]  think South Africa you think Nigeria is the same globalist force doing the same
[55:50.000 --> 55:53.640]  thing they want a civil war here black against white they want a civil war in
[55:53.640 --> 55:57.760]  Australia to then discredit the idea of nationalism and then bring in global
[55:57.760 --> 56:02.400]  corporatism and this is what he's saying is the solution to all this so again
[56:02.400 --> 56:07.360]  Lieutenant Colonel Ricardo bossy joins us again his Skype has come back what
[56:07.360 --> 56:12.240]  you're saying is again the the answer to everything and I'm not just highlighting
[56:12.240 --> 56:15.280]  that because you're on the show and I like you you are dead on here and we
[56:15.280 --> 56:20.680]  don't understand this we're gonna lose so we understand it we're gonna win that's
[56:20.680 --> 56:23.440]  correct I'm not sure where I dropped out did I get to the end state we're trying
[56:23.440 --> 56:26.920]  to create you know we're gonna go to break and you're gonna be with 30 more
[56:26.920 --> 56:29.040]  minutes the next hour I really appreciate that and we've got more great
[56:29.040 --> 56:33.240]  folks from Australia joining us former political president others but yes or
[56:33.240 --> 56:37.320]  you started to get to it but I want everybody to stay with us into the next
[56:37.320 --> 56:40.760]  hour where I'm gonna try to give you the floor to really walk through all this
[56:40.760 --> 56:43.680]  because you've got a great military background and we're one of the top
[56:43.680 --> 56:48.720]  advisors to your government and how you guys are gonna behave will then be an
[56:48.720 --> 56:51.920]  example everybody else in the world but the minute we have left in this hour how
[56:51.920 --> 56:55.560]  do people find you and not just in Australia but around the world how do
[56:55.560 --> 57:02.400]  people support your fight spread the word that's the best you can do just
[57:02.400 --> 57:05.600]  spread the word spread the word build the army build the army anything to build
[57:05.600 --> 57:10.040]  the army is what will help us best because we need numbers and I mean big
[57:10.040 --> 57:14.760]  numbers we need we need millions of people in Australia and we need tens of
[57:14.760 --> 57:19.040]  millions in the US and around the world to stand up and just say no and there's
[57:19.040 --> 57:23.880]  nothing they can do Australia one party calm Australia's fight is everybody's
[57:23.880 --> 57:29.000]  fight we face the exact same enemies and we are all in a human alliance around
[57:29.000 --> 57:32.400]  the world against this globalist force but the globalist force is coming after
[57:32.400 --> 57:37.000]  the western republics and quote democracy is they can destroy those the
[57:37.000 --> 57:40.240]  world will be under the new order's control we'll be back with our number
[57:40.240 --> 57:43.480]  two straight ahead stay with us
[57:50.600 --> 57:57.320]  so the placebo that they have used that the FDA has allowed them to use has
[57:57.320 --> 58:02.640]  often been another vaccine a vaccine with a known adverse reaction profile
[58:02.640 --> 58:09.240]  that's causing death and damage in its own right that it's the aluminum as an
[58:09.240 --> 58:13.720]  adjuvant in the vaccine a known neurotoxin a known immunotoxin a known
[58:13.720 --> 58:18.640]  poison in human beings that is in the supposedly inert placebo totally
[58:18.640 --> 58:24.920]  inappropriate this is not good science it is not science at all it is an effort
[58:24.920 --> 58:29.360]  to cover up the true adverse reaction rates to these vaccines so that they
[58:29.360 --> 58:34.960]  can get through the low barrier of constraints put there by the FDA and
[58:34.960 --> 58:39.680]  onto the market that is the only concern Dr. Wakefield is just one of many

[59:02.920 --> 59:09.720]  vaccination that was the current CEO of Pfizer just a few months ago on a
[59:09.720 --> 59:16.200]  national TV interview saying oh he doesn't need to take the so-called MRNA
[59:16.200 --> 59:20.840]  vaccine it's really achieved therapy he said you know he's 57 years old he's
[59:20.840 --> 59:24.560]  healthy he doesn't even get that risk people but that's not what is PR firms
[59:24.560 --> 59:29.400]  that have bought off the politicians over a hundred countries say they say
[59:29.400 --> 59:34.120]  you've got to take a job leave your house or get on a plane or a train or
[59:34.120 --> 59:38.440]  even get outside your home for one hour a day you live in Australia so remember
[59:38.440 --> 59:42.720]  the White House is exempt Congress and their staff are exempt the postal
[59:42.720 --> 59:46.560]  services exempt all these big corporate heads are exempt they're not taking
[59:46.560 --> 59:52.720]  their poison vaccine they're pushing it on you wake up folks wake up
[59:54.080 --> 59:59.560]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[59:59.560 --> 1:00:13.880]  well I get excited here because I became aware of the globalist plan when I
[1:00:13.880 --> 1:00:17.880]  was a teenager because I had family that was aware of it and speaking out
[1:00:17.880 --> 1:00:21.800]  against it and I had family that worked in the government in the military like
[1:00:21.800 --> 1:00:25.560]  our guest Ricardo bossing they were telling about the plan in the United
[1:00:25.560 --> 1:00:28.320]  States bringing world government he was reading a document from the 1980s
[1:00:28.320 --> 1:00:32.560]  planning it so this is the same global program some stages don't care the
[1:00:32.560 --> 1:00:37.160]  short five minutes a lot dude but I just specifically Ricardo you're you're very
[1:00:37.160 --> 1:00:42.160]  a polite guy but I'll jump in a lot if you don't just take over you tell folks
[1:00:42.160 --> 1:00:46.240]  exactly what you're facing what's going on and specifically how we don't fall
[1:00:46.240 --> 1:00:49.560]  into their trap and now we have a peaceful revolution of non-compliance
[1:00:49.560 --> 1:00:57.960]  versus being rubbed into a violent revolution sure the the what they're
[1:00:57.960 --> 1:01:04.320]  doing as you've seen on the media is confronting protesters but what they're
[1:01:04.320 --> 1:01:08.840]  not showing you is the truth and we have our own people out there which which
[1:01:08.840 --> 1:01:14.760]  communicate what's going on and you've seen the reports of violent right wing
[1:01:14.760 --> 1:01:18.000]  anti-vaxxers well there's nothing right wing about us at all I mean check our
[1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:23.760]  policies out and we're not violent and nor are the protesters so what happens
[1:01:23.760 --> 1:01:28.960]  is what happened in Melbourne most recently one of our major unions the
[1:01:28.960 --> 1:01:33.640]  the CFMEU the membership is split from the leadership because they know the
[1:01:33.640 --> 1:01:37.320]  leadership are fully on board with the globalists as an individual called
[1:01:37.320 --> 1:01:40.720]  Sharon Burroughs he used to be head of the Australian Council of Trade Union
[1:01:40.720 --> 1:01:44.360]  that's the peak union body in Australia who's now signed up globalist living in
[1:01:44.360 --> 1:01:50.600]  Belgium doing Carl Schwab's bidding so anyway the they're splitting apart and
[1:01:50.600 --> 1:01:53.800]  they were forming up and they started marching the police there about three
[1:01:53.800 --> 1:01:57.960]  or four hundred there the police told them to move on and the construction
[1:01:57.960 --> 1:02:01.920]  guys are they're pretty robust individuals down and down under as I
[1:02:01.920 --> 1:02:05.880]  guess they are in the US and they just ignored them and then three to four
[1:02:05.880 --> 1:02:09.320]  hundred turned into five thousand turned into ten thousand into twenty thousand
[1:02:09.320 --> 1:02:13.520]  but if you watch the news it sounded like there are three hundred cranky anti-vaxxers
[1:02:13.520 --> 1:02:18.040]  throwing fists at the at the police was completely the other way around and so
[1:02:18.040 --> 1:02:22.120]  they're lying to us but now how do we raise how do we and we raise this army
[1:02:22.120 --> 1:02:27.320]  for example the truth the truth is what's going to do it let me give you one
[1:02:27.320 --> 1:02:31.880]  story that I'll just get you riled we have in Australia a 90-year suppression
[1:02:31.880 --> 1:02:37.960]  order which conceals the names of 28 VIP pedophiles including a former prime
[1:02:37.960 --> 1:02:42.320]  minister now this document is a police document that was raised by Senator Bill
[1:02:42.320 --> 1:02:47.920]  Heffernan in 2015 in a Senate inquiry and he sat alone because no other senator
[1:02:47.920 --> 1:02:52.240]  would be there with him so we've got a 90-year suppression order which nobody
[1:02:52.240 --> 1:02:58.040]  no party liberal labor nationals and greens none of them have whispered because
[1:02:58.040 --> 1:03:02.320]  we know that that's there one of their key tools for getting the results that
[1:03:02.320 --> 1:03:07.440]  they want whether it's the judiciary or the military whatever that's the part of
[1:03:07.440 --> 1:03:10.520]  the blackmail now that's not the only one there's another one that came out of
[1:03:10.520 --> 1:03:13.160]  South Australia which is one of our Australian states and there was a
[1:03:13.160 --> 1:03:17.800]  Mulligan inquiry was called Justice Mulligan and that has an 80-year
[1:03:17.800 --> 1:03:23.320]  suppression order so pedophilia this this this this golden thread I shouldn't
[1:03:23.320 --> 1:03:28.520]  call it a golden thread I should call it something less glossy this awful thread
[1:03:28.520 --> 1:03:32.480]  that runs through the control and that's how one of the main reasons one of the
[1:03:32.480 --> 1:03:37.320]  main methods they have used to get a hold of the judiciary the bureaucracy the
[1:03:37.320 --> 1:03:43.800]  military the academia the media everything it's it's that and so get the
[1:03:43.800 --> 1:03:47.840]  truth out and we we raise the truth as much as we can so people wake up and
[1:03:47.840 --> 1:03:54.600]  they realize there is a war and it is against us and the police are doing the
[1:03:54.600 --> 1:03:59.280]  bidding now you mentioned why don't the police in the military do something
[1:03:59.280 --> 1:04:03.720]  Alex I've been looking for white hats in the ADF and Australian Defense Force for
[1:04:03.720 --> 1:04:08.040]  a long time now and I can't see any and I mean it I've looked hard in fact they've
[1:04:08.040 --> 1:04:12.880]  even turned some of my former colleagues against me I was a best man at one of my
[1:04:12.880 --> 1:04:16.200]  friends wedding he was another special forces officer and they sent him up
[1:04:16.200 --> 1:04:20.560]  against me to get some intel to find out what I was up to and so this is really
[1:04:20.560 --> 1:04:25.360]  Australia Contramondum Australia against the world they are they are there are no
[1:04:25.360 --> 1:04:29.520]  white hats and I have this little dream that when we get into power and we will
[1:04:29.520 --> 1:04:37.760]  that I'll call up look for a decent four-star US Marine Corps general because
[1:04:37.760 --> 1:04:41.680]  they can see sea air land and special ops fights we'll bring them in on a five
[1:04:41.680 --> 1:04:47.480]  year contract to Australia and will he'll have one job is to turn this woke joke
[1:04:47.480 --> 1:04:51.760]  which is what the Australian Defense Force is into a fighting machine again
[1:04:51.760 --> 1:04:55.240]  and so we'll get him in the other thing left to do is we'll sack everybody from
[1:04:55.240 --> 1:04:59.720]  the rank of breeder up will be retired immediately stay there back in 60 seconds
[1:04:59.720 --> 1:05:04.840]  Ricardo bossy stay with us we've all heard about the pastor in his famous
[1:05:04.840 --> 1:05:09.400]  statement from inside a concentration camp in World War two that when they
[1:05:09.400 --> 1:05:12.760]  came for one group he wasn't part of that group so he didn't stand up and then
[1:05:12.760 --> 1:05:15.440]  when they came for another group he wasn't part of that group so he didn't
[1:05:15.440 --> 1:05:20.560]  stand up and finally they came for him there was nobody else to stand up all
[1:05:20.560 --> 1:05:23.880]  the global social credit score that China's putting in its banning people to
[1:05:23.880 --> 1:05:27.360]  three hours of video games a week and if you criticize the government you can
[1:05:27.360 --> 1:05:31.080]  never buy or sell again well that's that's being brought here in all of the
[1:05:31.080 --> 1:05:35.360]  world under the guise of COVID vaccine passports they even admit it now
[1:05:35.360 --> 1:05:38.720]  Thursday is going to be a carbon tax attached to it they're gonna track where
[1:05:38.720 --> 1:05:42.680]  you go what you do and decide where you can go and what you can do that's what
[1:05:42.680 --> 1:05:47.640]  the lockdowns are about you'll accept that you'll accept anything so again the
[1:05:47.640 --> 1:05:51.160]  left is having fun right now with all the censorship and tyranny pretending
[1:05:51.160 --> 1:05:53.920]  they're part of the power structure but they're all going to be targeted by
[1:05:53.920 --> 1:05:57.160]  this nightmare as well we need to get back to basic human rights and promote
[1:05:57.160 --> 1:06:00.840]  them or all of us will be enslaved by this horrible technocracy run by the
[1:06:00.840 --> 1:06:03.280]  globalist
[1:06:10.120 --> 1:06:13.720]  I want everybody listening here in the United States on hundreds of radio
[1:06:13.720 --> 1:06:19.360]  stations and over a hundred TV stations to please take notes and check out
[1:06:19.360 --> 1:06:23.720]  everything we're laying out and breaking down here on the Alex Jones show on this
[1:06:23.720 --> 1:06:29.520]  live September 26 Sunday broadcast because all I read is what the UN and the
[1:06:29.520 --> 1:06:33.280]  Davos group and the Bilderberg group are putting out and the Club of Rome it's all
[1:06:33.280 --> 1:06:37.680]  the same people that share it all the CFR and the Royal Commissions the
[1:06:37.680 --> 1:06:42.000]  Royalist of International Affairs these are roundtable groups and it's how the
[1:06:42.000 --> 1:06:45.400]  corporate British Empire controlled the world but it's not the British Empire
[1:06:45.400 --> 1:06:50.760]  today it's it's but it used that skeletal system and if we're going to
[1:06:50.760 --> 1:06:55.120]  defeat it it's what Muhammad Gandhi did in India against that very Empire and
[1:06:55.120 --> 1:06:59.320]  what our guests said earlier is totally true Australia is having its coming of
[1:06:59.320 --> 1:07:03.640]  age real revolution right now against the governor general and the and the
[1:07:03.640 --> 1:07:07.160]  vestigial systems of tyranny and they looked the whole world and said that's
[1:07:07.160 --> 1:07:11.160]  the best place to have our beta test to trigger our civil war crush the people
[1:07:11.160 --> 1:07:15.640]  and bring in total tyranny same thing that's happening here with no borders
[1:07:15.640 --> 1:07:19.480]  no walls the attacks on America the racial division all of this is to
[1:07:19.480 --> 1:07:22.800]  moralize you putting in Biden he's supposed to be hated he's supposed to
[1:07:22.800 --> 1:07:26.000]  make the country look terrible because they want a collapse but with them
[1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:30.960]  posing as the saviors they're bringing in their world government they're bringing
[1:07:30.960 --> 1:07:35.200]  in their world ID so you see Australia with the military and the police and an
[1:07:35.200 --> 1:07:39.520]  unmarked police beating up all ladies arresting men women and children for
[1:07:39.520 --> 1:07:44.600]  going outside saying they're not essential this is part of the takeover of
[1:07:44.600 --> 1:07:49.320]  the planet and there's only one way politically culturally militarily to
[1:07:49.320 --> 1:07:53.760]  defeat this and it's how he's talking about recognizing it's a foreign takeover
[1:07:53.760 --> 1:07:57.600]  recognizing it's illegitimate recognizing we have global solidarity with each
[1:07:57.600 --> 1:08:02.120]  other against this corporate new world order that uses socialism and communism
[1:08:02.120 --> 1:08:05.840]  and leftist garbage as his control system we're not right wing I agree with
[1:08:05.840 --> 1:08:10.880]  him we're populist worldwide who want to get back to governing our own countries
[1:08:10.880 --> 1:08:14.720]  for the people by the people of the people to Ricardo bossy sir with us
[1:08:14.720 --> 1:08:20.960]  Australia one party dot com and again he was a special L services lieutenant
[1:08:20.960 --> 1:08:25.600]  colonel and he was also national commander of Australian SAS forces he
[1:08:25.600 --> 1:08:28.440]  also was the director of future capability development headquarters
[1:08:28.440 --> 1:08:32.720]  special operations amongst others he can speak to the type of societal
[1:08:32.720 --> 1:08:37.360]  behavioral psychology takeover that wants to make it physical to radically
[1:08:37.360 --> 1:08:42.960]  reshuffle that's what they're building quote emergency camps for shielding in
[1:08:42.960 --> 1:08:46.960]  place they have the same thing in Europe same thing here they say soon we'll put
[1:08:46.960 --> 1:08:50.720]  people that are healthy in camps to protect them from those that aren't and
[1:08:50.720 --> 1:08:55.400]  the anti-vaxxers that's the cover for the internment camps are building once
[1:08:55.400 --> 1:08:59.120]  they trigger the civil wars so they have them here they have them in Canada
[1:08:59.120 --> 1:09:05.360]  Europe UK Australia New Zealand this is a formulaic operation globally we must
[1:09:05.360 --> 1:09:09.800]  formulaically awaken to it and say no I'ma stop ranting here Ricardo bossy but
[1:09:09.800 --> 1:09:13.280]  you've got the four of the rest of the segment the next to raise the alarm
[1:09:13.280 --> 1:09:20.000]  worldwide and explain again how we have victory without violence absolutely well
[1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:23.520]  let's say you mentioned the Constitution the governor general in
[1:09:23.520 --> 1:09:26.840]  Australia and this is part of raising the awareness letting people know there
[1:09:26.840 --> 1:09:30.120]  are solutions to this let me give you an example I wrote an open letter to our
[1:09:30.120 --> 1:09:35.880]  governor general whom I knew when he was lieutenant colonel major and he has
[1:09:35.880 --> 1:09:40.160]  options open to him that the people are unaware of for example the prime
[1:09:40.160 --> 1:09:43.400]  minister and the cabinet isn't mentioning our Constitution a national
[1:09:43.400 --> 1:09:47.840]  executive federal executive is mentioned appointed by the governor general now if
[1:09:47.840 --> 1:09:51.800]  a government continues with unconstitutional behavior of which
[1:09:51.800 --> 1:09:57.600]  there is sufficient evidence without a doubt grossly unconstitutional behavior
[1:09:57.600 --> 1:10:02.720]  on and on any level the governor general must warn the government of that fact
[1:10:02.720 --> 1:10:05.960]  if they persist with their unconstitutional behavior the governor
[1:10:05.960 --> 1:10:09.680]  general has the right to dismiss the government now nobody wants to do that
[1:10:09.680 --> 1:10:16.960]  that because it's it it's unstable it destabilizes the the the rule of law in
[1:10:16.960 --> 1:10:21.240]  the minds of the people but he has the power and I mean you can't think of a
[1:10:21.240 --> 1:10:25.560]  better reason to start maybe making some suggestions to the government about the
[1:10:25.560 --> 1:10:28.880]  constitutionality of their behavior but the governor general has the lawful
[1:10:28.880 --> 1:10:32.360]  authority now imagine this this is just one option open to ending this
[1:10:32.360 --> 1:10:37.600]  immediately the governor general has the power to warn the government to cease
[1:10:37.600 --> 1:10:42.840]  their unconstitutional unconstitutional behavior let's say it doesn't then he
[1:10:42.840 --> 1:10:50.760]  dismisses the government and he may appoint for a period of three months
[1:10:50.760 --> 1:10:57.640]  anybody to act as as members of the federal executive council and they may
[1:10:57.640 --> 1:11:02.720]  then operate as departmental secretaries or in the US model secretaries of state
[1:11:02.720 --> 1:11:08.360]  secretaries of health secretaries of defense the cabinet and so this could
[1:11:08.360 --> 1:11:14.240]  be ended tomorrow he appoints some people they fill in and and they take
[1:11:14.240 --> 1:11:16.880]  over the run in the country it's quite lawful because this was one of the
[1:11:16.880 --> 1:11:20.840]  checks and measures that was put in by our founding fathers to make sure too
[1:11:20.840 --> 1:11:24.480]  and he was not allowed now what advice is the governor general getting what I
[1:11:24.480 --> 1:11:30.320]  can guarantee it's globalist advice it's not the real advice now it's up to him
[1:11:30.320 --> 1:11:34.280]  he's been given the opportunity there are opportunities now for him to take
[1:11:34.280 --> 1:11:38.200]  action if he doesn't like everybody else here signed his own death warrant because
[1:11:38.200 --> 1:11:41.920]  one of our other key policies is we're going to reintroduce death penalty for
[1:11:41.920 --> 1:11:47.680]  treason and sedition and we got rid of the death penalty 70 years ago and and
[1:11:47.680 --> 1:11:50.280]  we're going to bring it back and what's interesting is that the leftists are
[1:11:50.280 --> 1:11:56.120]  claiming that we're brutal and and inhuman for reintroducing the death
[1:11:56.120 --> 1:12:01.160]  penalty for treason and sedition yet these are the same people who allow the
[1:12:01.160 --> 1:12:04.720]  most egregious abortion full-term abortion laws in Australia in fact the
[1:12:04.720 --> 1:12:09.640]  US has only just caught up to Australia see out the globalist hands reach into
[1:12:09.640 --> 1:12:13.720]  every aspect of our life here and we've had full-term abortion partial birth
[1:12:13.720 --> 1:12:18.280]  abortion laws creeping their way across Australia for years now and the
[1:12:18.280 --> 1:12:20.840]  Australian people don't know about it they don't understand it they don't
[1:12:20.840 --> 1:12:26.000]  believe it but I need to get this out in full so people of Australia understand
[1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:32.360]  this it is lawful in Australia at the point of birth for a doctor to
[1:12:32.360 --> 1:12:36.280]  partially deliver the baby so the baby's head remains inside the mother so it's
[1:12:36.280 --> 1:12:40.720]  not born inverted commas by definition the doctor then gets a pair of medicine
[1:12:40.720 --> 1:12:45.360]  bound scissors and jabs a hole in the back of the baby's head cuts it open
[1:12:45.360 --> 1:12:50.720]  inserts a vacuum pump and sucks out the living brain of a baby at full term the
[1:12:50.720 --> 1:12:54.120]  baby is then delivered but it's not called a baby it's called medical waste
[1:12:54.120 --> 1:12:58.720]  it's not given a birth certificate a death certificate it is then sold as
[1:12:58.720 --> 1:13:04.120]  body parts to corporations now this is legal in Australia and allegedly called
[1:13:04.120 --> 1:13:09.600]  health for women now if these people are such moral imbeciles that they can't
[1:13:09.600 --> 1:13:14.120]  see the difference between a morning after pill and a full-term abortion and
[1:13:14.120 --> 1:13:19.840]  they have no place in polite society they know exactly what they're doing in
[1:13:19.840 --> 1:13:23.240]  substations just joined us earlier you broke down how it's the same thing in
[1:13:23.240 --> 1:13:27.880]  Europe same thing in the US same thing there they use pedophilia in government
[1:13:27.880 --> 1:13:33.120]  by promoting pedophiles from a level of mayor up to your Senate and other areas
[1:13:33.120 --> 1:13:38.000]  and that your government had 80 year seals on that in the government and if
[1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:41.960]  you look at the German government the 30 plus thousand children placed with
[1:13:41.960 --> 1:13:47.160]  pedophiles to then be leased out to politicians we even learn the CIA would
[1:13:47.160 --> 1:13:51.840]  put pedophiles in charge over police departments and areas in Afghanistan and
[1:13:51.840 --> 1:13:56.600]  supply them with children so so this is a evil cult of pedophiles that are at the
[1:13:56.600 --> 1:14:03.040]  heart of what we face worldwide yeah exactly right it's it is worldwide it is
[1:14:03.040 --> 1:14:06.120]  common it is the way it's being done and under the people have to understand this
[1:14:06.120 --> 1:14:11.000]  this has been going on since forever this is not a recent innovation this is
[1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:16.840]  this is millennia old these practices child sacrifice the the whole
[1:14:16.840 --> 1:14:22.400]  adrenochrome issue this is not new this is an ancient war and look we're not
[1:14:22.400 --> 1:14:27.720]  fighting just flesh and blood as you well know we are fighting satanic
[1:14:27.720 --> 1:14:34.080]  forces by definition satanic forces and one of them the major means by which it
[1:14:34.080 --> 1:14:39.280]  is delivered is by the masonic lodges now the low level masons think it's just
[1:14:39.280 --> 1:14:44.080]  a gentleman's club and you get to promote your business and do well but at
[1:14:44.080 --> 1:14:49.720]  the higher levels we know exactly what's going on it is satanic it is it is a
[1:14:49.720 --> 1:14:54.040]  blood ritual sacrifice that goes on regularly and then and I've been
[1:14:54.040 --> 1:14:58.360]  contacted by masons who have reluctantly admitted we think you're right
[1:14:58.360 --> 1:15:02.320]  there's something going on something's not quite right but the masons have
[1:15:02.320 --> 1:15:07.480]  penetrated every aspect of Australian society now given the given that case
[1:15:07.480 --> 1:15:10.840]  and I think I mentioned it earlier when when a body has is so riddled with
[1:15:10.840 --> 1:15:15.120]  cancer that if you try to cut it out you're gonna kill the host that's why
[1:15:15.120 --> 1:15:20.200]  the solution to this must be measured it must be careful because otherwise we're
[1:15:20.200 --> 1:15:24.360]  gonna kill we'll face a civilizational collapse now imagine if all the crooks
[1:15:24.360 --> 1:15:28.240]  put their hands up and said thank you you're alright and we'll go away the
[1:15:28.240 --> 1:15:32.120]  place will cease to function so we have to transition from this masonic
[1:15:32.120 --> 1:15:37.120]  controlled satanist cult to a point where they are removed and the country
[1:15:37.120 --> 1:15:41.400]  continues absolutely and we've got to explain this when we come back it's a
[1:15:41.400 --> 1:15:45.080]  mystery school it's what intelligence agencies grew out of it's it's just a
[1:15:45.080 --> 1:15:50.120]  cult that is in control worldwide whose ritual is abusing children killing
[1:15:50.120 --> 1:15:55.160]  children and it's real and it's coming out one city in Germany 30,000 children
[1:15:55.160 --> 1:15:58.520]  taken from Christians given to pedophiles for the government but right
[1:15:58.520 --> 1:16:05.440]  back it's only been in the last 60 years that we've had satellites that can
[1:16:05.440 --> 1:16:10.320]  decently measure what's happening in the atmosphere but if you look at all the
[1:16:10.320 --> 1:16:14.760]  different studies reports about my NASA and other governments other agencies they
[1:16:14.760 --> 1:16:18.840]  all disagree on what's really happening with climate the only constant only great
[1:16:18.840 --> 1:16:25.760]  truth is change is the only constant so yes climate change is totally real but
[1:16:25.760 --> 1:16:29.040]  notice first they called it global freezing back in the 70s 80s and then
[1:16:29.040 --> 1:16:31.680]  it's gonna be global warming and when that didn't really happen the way they
[1:16:31.680 --> 1:16:35.880]  wanted to okay now it's just climate change but did you know that man-made
[1:16:35.880 --> 1:16:41.080]  climate change is a real thing when it comes to the United Nations and the
[1:16:41.080 --> 1:16:45.600]  Department of Energy and Bill Gates and the UN they have weather control trees
[1:16:45.600 --> 1:16:50.040]  from 1979 Bill Gates has been manipulating the weather for a very long
[1:16:50.040 --> 1:16:54.360]  time in fact back in 1994 two scientists won a Nobel Prize for an idea of
[1:16:54.360 --> 1:16:58.000]  spring different particles out of jet engines to control the weather so yes
[1:16:58.000 --> 1:17:04.680]  man-made climate change is real when Bob Woodward's new book came out alleging
[1:17:04.680 --> 1:17:07.920]  that General Milley had called the head of the Chinese military and said Trump
[1:17:07.920 --> 1:17:11.880]  might nuke you he tried to overthrow the US government but basically I'm
[1:17:11.880 --> 1:17:15.600]  protecting you and I'll warn you if we launch an attack which was the greatest
[1:17:15.600 --> 1:17:19.920]  reason in US history that has ever been committed people said oh Alex it must not
[1:17:19.920 --> 1:17:23.160]  be true and I might wait Bob Woodward's former naval intelligence he's a big
[1:17:23.160 --> 1:17:26.920]  insider globalist he wouldn't have put this out unless they wanted to put it
[1:17:26.920 --> 1:17:31.160]  out say that Billy was a hero to set the precedent you can have a permanent
[1:17:31.160 --> 1:17:35.160]  bureaucracy stay behind network deep state basically that has its own bureaucratic
[1:17:35.160 --> 1:17:38.520]  coup over America that's why he put five in he's so incredibly weak he's to
[1:17:38.520 --> 1:17:42.000]  undermine the idea of the presidency well people said I was making it up with
[1:17:42.000 --> 1:17:46.080]  Bob Woodward's line well now Milley admits he did it you see I didn't need to
[1:17:46.080 --> 1:17:50.720]  trust Bob Woodward I remember Pelosi on January 8th ragging that she got the
[1:17:50.720 --> 1:17:54.000]  call for Milley that he take control of the nukes so this treason was hiding
[1:17:54.000 --> 1:17:57.440]  and playing to you back then and we covered it see I have a memory folks I
[1:17:57.440 --> 1:18:02.920]  remember all this stuff that's why I know it's true and what's false I have
[1:18:02.920 --> 1:18:07.160]  the greatest sense of loss deep in my heart deep in my soul I've ever had in
[1:18:07.160 --> 1:18:13.600]  my 47 years on this planet I've had a lot of loss everybody else has and it's
[1:18:13.600 --> 1:18:22.600]  because it's a loss of ancestral freedom that so many people fought and died
[1:18:22.600 --> 1:18:30.400]  and bled and sweat for and now we're just throwing it all away and I see the
[1:18:30.400 --> 1:18:34.520]  general public in a medically induced scientifically induced behavioral
[1:18:34.520 --> 1:18:40.600]  psychologically controlled tranche and I know we're being fed into this
[1:18:40.600 --> 1:18:47.000]  globalist me grounded it's so incredibly sad but this is the process of birth and
[1:18:47.000 --> 1:18:51.400]  then growth and then falling apart and then degenerating collapsing and then
[1:18:51.400 --> 1:18:56.400]  coming back to life again it's just the globalist are actively trying to steer
[1:18:56.400 --> 1:19:00.800]  and control this process of decadence and collapse to actually end the species as

[1:20:08.840 --> 1:20:27.280]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's
[1:20:27.280 --> 1:20:36.040]  alex jones I guess it's Monday morning there in Australia and it's still a
[1:20:36.040 --> 1:20:41.760]  little Sunday here coming up Monica Schmidt been a political prisoner
[1:20:41.760 --> 1:20:44.840]  arrested for trying to organize businesses that said they would stay open
[1:20:44.840 --> 1:20:48.760]  only big corporations are allowed to stay open and solid a control this is
[1:20:48.760 --> 1:20:53.080]  economic warfare on so many levels Ricardo bossy is our guest he heads up
[1:20:53.080 --> 1:20:57.280]  Australia one party Australia one party calm or Australia one and we've got
[1:20:57.280 --> 1:21:02.600]  about eight nine minutes left here what can Americans do because again you're
[1:21:02.600 --> 1:21:07.720]  being attacked by the same globalist force what can people do in other parts
[1:21:07.720 --> 1:21:11.480]  the world to try to free Australia and free other areas Canada's in deep
[1:21:11.480 --> 1:21:15.920]  trouble I mean clearly just expose the new world order but but what else can
[1:21:15.920 --> 1:21:20.680]  we do because we know that they want to push everybody into violent revolution
[1:21:20.680 --> 1:21:23.680]  that's why they tighten it down it's like it's worse and worse we know they've
[1:21:23.680 --> 1:21:28.920]  built the emergency centers if they were able to trigger a civil war they say
[1:21:28.920 --> 1:21:32.560]  they want to post-industrial world they say they want general society to
[1:21:32.560 --> 1:21:35.800]  collapse and depopulate while I guess the globalists sit back in their
[1:21:35.800 --> 1:21:39.880]  mountaintop redoubts and roast marshmallows you know over the flames
[1:21:39.880 --> 1:21:45.480]  that consumers so you've got a big military background at national global
[1:21:45.480 --> 1:21:49.400]  strategy levels what would it look like if they were successfully able to
[1:21:49.400 --> 1:21:57.120]  trigger a civil war in Australia civilizational collapse because we're a
[1:21:57.120 --> 1:22:01.360]  very dispersed population we're centric centered in our major city so it's
[1:22:01.360 --> 1:22:06.520]  easy to contain us and they've been working hard to strip the rural areas
[1:22:06.520 --> 1:22:10.960]  of its population and of course our policies to reverse that but they lock
[1:22:10.960 --> 1:22:16.080]  us up in the city and they and they'll just kill us they will just kill us
[1:22:16.080 --> 1:22:20.640]  they will just lock us down fast-track it from the actual let's say there's a
[1:22:20.640 --> 1:22:25.400]  violent response that those that take the violent actions are jailed they will
[1:22:25.400 --> 1:22:30.400]  then impose even more draconian lockdowns on the entire country and the
[1:22:30.400 --> 1:22:34.440]  Holodomor which was the starvation of the Ukraine's under the Soviet Union
[1:22:34.440 --> 1:22:41.760]  millions died to the point of cannibalism the Chinese communists twice kill I
[1:22:41.760 --> 1:22:46.800]  think up to 40 million of their own people through famine so these things
[1:22:46.800 --> 1:22:51.680]  are not unusual this is not odd this is not unexpected this is exactly what they
[1:22:51.680 --> 1:22:54.760]  do and that's why people have to understand their history this is not
[1:22:54.760 --> 1:23:00.400]  bizarre it is not the beyond the realms of reality exactly this is a communist
[1:23:00.400 --> 1:23:04.840]  great leap forward culture revolution playbook that we saw in the Russian
[1:23:04.840 --> 1:23:08.040]  Revolution we've seen everywhere and again finance with the very same banks
[1:23:08.040 --> 1:23:12.240]  in Russia now financing this now I mean you're dead on they are actually trying
[1:23:12.240 --> 1:23:17.480]  a collapse level event to get full control and depopulate and that's and
[1:23:17.480 --> 1:23:21.880]  that is exactly correct and there is no there is no real war until let me just
[1:23:21.880 --> 1:23:25.520]  jump quickly beware of the China threat is it going to be a war against China
[1:23:25.520 --> 1:23:29.360]  probably is it going to be a real war absolutely is it going to be necessary
[1:23:29.360 --> 1:23:33.280]  no it's a distraction it's absolutely no requirement it just it was just like
[1:23:33.280 --> 1:23:38.720]  World War one World War two it's good business it's great business the whole
[1:23:38.720 --> 1:23:41.560]  thing was was set up that way and we're going to go through it all again so now
[1:23:41.560 --> 1:23:45.360]  again if people knew their real history they would recognize this for what it is
[1:23:45.360 --> 1:23:49.840]  it is a lie everything they've been taught is a lie and I understand the
[1:23:49.840 --> 1:23:55.160]  difficulty of accepting that it is hard but the fact is we've got to you said
[1:23:55.160 --> 1:24:00.160]  you know what can the world do reveal the truth reveal the truth and and
[1:24:00.160 --> 1:24:03.080]  communicate with each other internationally and share each other
[1:24:03.080 --> 1:24:09.240]  share with each other the stories it's paramount importance it really is
[1:24:09.240 --> 1:24:11.640]  there's one other thing the US can do particularly because you've got the
[1:24:11.640 --> 1:24:15.560]  capability and then is we're going to have some elections coming up shortly
[1:24:15.560 --> 1:24:22.800]  and I'll bet my left marble that it will be corrupted we know that it'll either
[1:24:22.800 --> 1:24:29.400]  be a fake for postal election or it'll just be fraudulent we know that we
[1:24:29.400 --> 1:24:32.480]  haven't had an honest election in Australia for decades and we've got the
[1:24:32.480 --> 1:24:35.600]  data on that as well books have been written about it there's nothing
[1:24:35.600 --> 1:24:41.440]  unusual about that statement so there will be a war there will be an election
[1:24:41.440 --> 1:24:45.960]  monitoring now we have knowing that's going to be a crooked election we have
[1:24:45.960 --> 1:24:50.200]  our own strategies and plans of what we're going to do we expect it to be
[1:24:50.200 --> 1:24:54.640]  crooked we expect to have like you have in the US and audit and we expect the
[1:24:54.640 --> 1:24:57.840]  order to reveal exactly what your audits are revealing have revealed in
[1:24:57.840 --> 1:25:01.720]  Arizona and elsewhere and so this is part of that slow process of
[1:25:01.720 --> 1:25:08.160]  legitimately demonstrating the lies of the the globalists so the US because
[1:25:08.160 --> 1:25:12.000]  you've got the capability track and monitor our elections when they're
[1:25:12.000 --> 1:25:18.520]  coming up now the next federal election is due in May next year May 2022 it may
[1:25:18.520 --> 1:25:24.000]  be held sooner than that but that's it if we can if we can get an honor as
[1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:29.000]  honest an election is possible we've got a chance even if it's crooked then we'll
[1:25:29.000 --> 1:25:32.560]  go through the same patient process as you have done and we'll audit audit
[1:25:32.560 --> 1:25:37.080]  audit and so keep an eye on each other we're like a family the Australians are
[1:25:37.080 --> 1:25:39.600]  looking at the Americans the Americans look at the Australians we're all look
[1:25:39.600 --> 1:25:43.760]  at the Canadians the Europe this is as you said at the very beginning this is
[1:25:43.760 --> 1:25:49.160]  one human race and we are fighting for our collective survival we have the
[1:25:49.160 --> 1:25:53.800]  same adversary applying exactly the same tactics Australia is lucky we're the
[1:25:53.800 --> 1:25:58.160]  first ones through the door and as you know the first one through the door
[1:25:58.160 --> 1:26:01.880]  always gets a blood nose but as long as we've got a lot of people behind us we'll
[1:26:01.880 --> 1:26:05.960]  eventually we'll take the room and so that's what we need to do we need to
[1:26:05.960 --> 1:26:10.360]  come together as a global community and understand that whatever apparent
[1:26:10.360 --> 1:26:15.960]  differences we have that the great majority of people are good people they're
[1:26:15.960 --> 1:26:19.960]  decent people we're not a cancer on the planet as the lunatic greens would have
[1:26:19.960 --> 1:26:25.240]  us believe well that's right we need to educate everybody that the the greens
[1:26:25.240 --> 1:26:32.000]  are a depopulationist elite movement all of it is is is right out of Davos right
[1:26:32.000 --> 1:26:36.160]  out of the globalist and is the enemy of humanity and they've got to be stopped
[1:26:36.160 --> 1:26:41.840]  they will be stopped that's it and I've got a we've got only got a couple of
[1:26:41.840 --> 1:26:45.440]  minutes left but I'd like to just finish on this because I'm a good student of the
[1:26:45.440 --> 1:26:52.200]  US War of Independence the Revolutionary War couple of points Washington at one
[1:26:52.200 --> 1:26:56.240]  point had no more than 20% support so four out of five of the colonists were
[1:26:56.240 --> 1:27:00.240]  telling the Brits exactly where he was and he still won the point the reason I
[1:27:00.240 --> 1:27:04.200]  tell that story is because we don't need everybody we just need enough we just
[1:27:04.200 --> 1:27:08.520]  need enough and we can win this war in Australia that translation at 20% that's
[1:27:08.520 --> 1:27:12.840]  five million people we get five million we win Davos losers and they'll never
[1:27:12.840 --> 1:27:15.960]  come back because we know exactly what we're going to do day one we get control
[1:27:15.960 --> 1:27:21.000]  we know exactly what our plan is we've got it ready to go the next point is and
[1:27:21.000 --> 1:27:24.440]  I'll finish on this and I'll let you wrap it up the opening lines to your
[1:27:24.440 --> 1:27:28.440]  Declaration of Independence the the most beautiful political lines ever written
[1:27:28.440 --> 1:27:34.360]  we hold these truths to be self-evident and you know the rest but those opening
[1:27:34.360 --> 1:27:39.040]  lines as beautiful as they were were irrelevant they only had meaning and
[1:27:39.040 --> 1:27:43.440]  effect because of the last line and this is what Australians have to understand
[1:27:43.440 --> 1:27:46.440]  for the first time in their lives because we are fighting for our country
[1:27:46.440 --> 1:27:50.760]  for the first time in our lives on our own land and here's the last line which
[1:27:50.760 --> 1:27:58.720]  everybody should remember we can we could collectively commit our lives our
[1:27:58.720 --> 1:28:03.520]  fortunes and our sacred honor and that's what we have to commit that is the
[1:28:03.520 --> 1:28:07.600]  price of freedom that we must pay that our fathers and forefathers before us
[1:28:07.600 --> 1:28:11.960]  paid we have to be ready to do the same we have to commit everything to this
[1:28:11.960 --> 1:28:17.560]  fight everything leave nothing on the table our lives our wealth and our
[1:28:17.560 --> 1:28:22.520]  sacred honor and we are blessed and honored as you said to be in this
[1:28:22.520 --> 1:28:26.000]  position this is a great turning this only happens every three or four five
[1:28:26.000 --> 1:28:29.360]  generations this is a very special time to be out live we are all brothers and
[1:28:29.360 --> 1:28:32.640]  sisters together around the world this fight and I want to thank you Ricardo

[1:28:49.640 --> 1:28:53.960]  because the tyranny of Australia today is the tyranny here tomorrow but we're
[1:28:53.960 --> 1:28:57.880]  going to win this is a great opportunity great job to the crew I'll be
[1:28:57.880 --> 1:29:02.120]  right back and then Owen shroyers live in studio for two hours you understand
[1:29:02.120 --> 1:29:08.000]  that this is not FDA approved it's totally experimental it's never been
[1:29:08.000 --> 1:29:13.760]  given to human beings before some of the ingredients inside of these of these
[1:29:13.760 --> 1:29:19.080]  shots have never been injected in human beings before there are no long-term
[1:29:19.080 --> 1:29:23.640]  studies we don't know what's going to happen inside your body somewhere four
[1:29:23.640 --> 1:29:28.520]  to six weeks after your second injection or four to six months or even two
[1:29:28.520 --> 1:29:33.960]  years we have no idea whether it's going to cause infertility whether it's
[1:29:33.960 --> 1:29:38.520]  going to cause cancer how bad your autoimmune disease is going to be my
[1:29:38.520 --> 1:29:42.040]  conclusion after looking at this for a long time and listening to the arguments
[1:29:42.040 --> 1:29:46.480]  for these masks I determined that if you believe if you're a medical doctor or a
[1:29:46.480 --> 1:29:50.200]  scientist that's spouting using these masks you're either being played or
[1:29:50.200 --> 1:29:55.960]  you're being paid secure your copy of covenland today at covenland.com if you

[1:29:59.120 --> 1:30:23.120]  enslavement.
[1:30:29.120 --> 1:30:35.080]  But the general public does not even know that so when that criminal with his
[1:30:35.080 --> 1:30:42.000]  pedophile crackhead son gets up there on television and tells you that you are
[1:30:42.000 --> 1:30:45.840]  to blame because you didn't take your poison shot that is a giant lie
[1:30:45.840 --> 1:30:51.840]  countries like Israel and Singapore with the highest vaccine rate have the
[1:30:51.840 --> 1:30:56.960]  highest death and highest illness rates that is the facts get that information
[1:30:56.960 --> 1:31:00.680]  up to your friends family and strangers like your life depends on it because it
[1:31:00.680 --> 1:31:06.120]  does you know it's crazy to get to this point it's very bittersweet everything

[1:31:09.240 --> 1:31:11.880]  lot of credibility but I don't care about that I care about beating the new
[1:31:11.880 --> 1:31:16.040]  world order and it's because we have so much credibility they can't allow us to
[1:31:16.040 --> 1:31:19.400]  stay on air much longer and I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're
[1:31:19.400 --> 1:31:23.120]  doing to us for a lot of reasons I can't tell you what's going on but let's just

[1:33:31.280 --> 1:33:37.400]  what happens so I just thought I'd put the live stream on just in case
[1:33:40.440 --> 1:33:45.280]  I know why I just took my seatbelt off that was stupid

[1:34:35.240 --> 1:34:40.080]  crime in the once free country now known as not Australia but New North Korea here
[1:34:40.080 --> 1:35:06.240]  at this and so she tried to speak they tried to arrest her people stood up the
[1:35:06.240 --> 1:35:10.040]  thugs trying to assault a woman they call that incitement because they she
[1:35:10.040 --> 1:35:14.520]  made them beat up that man and take him to jail incredible joining us again in
[1:35:14.520 --> 1:35:19.400]  the middle of the early morning is the lady Monica Schmidt here's the headline
[1:35:19.400 --> 1:35:23.080]  out of the biggest newspaper in Australia anti facts leader reveals
[1:35:23.080 --> 1:35:27.760]  engagement at the release from jail news.com.au Australia's leading news
[1:35:27.760 --> 1:35:33.000]  site report she's been released after the Supreme Court said that she's being
[1:35:33.000 --> 1:35:39.360]  basically held for too long without bail but she still faces time in prison
[1:35:39.360 --> 1:35:44.160]  so we really appreciate Monica Schmidt we really appreciate her joining us wow
[1:35:44.160 --> 1:35:48.880]  just amazing times thank you so much for coming on with us oh it's an absolute
[1:35:48.880 --> 1:35:53.880]  honor I'm so excited to be on here thank you so much for having me well they
[1:35:53.880 --> 1:35:58.280]  try to silence you and it's not works you've got the floor right now to just
[1:35:58.280 --> 1:36:01.560]  tell us what's happened in prison where your country is where this is going and
[1:36:01.560 --> 1:36:06.200]  just everything that's happened sure well I will just set the record straight
[1:36:06.200 --> 1:36:11.040]  Alex I was in prison for 22 days not six months although it did feel like six
[1:36:11.040 --> 1:36:16.000]  months but I had a great legal team so it wasn't too too long but basically the
[1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:20.960]  bail conditions Alex well I have a website with almost 70,000 subscribers
[1:36:20.960 --> 1:36:24.880]  which in Australia is really quite significant and I'm also the vice
[1:36:24.880 --> 1:36:29.720]  president of a newly formed political party now they actually wanted me to
[1:36:29.720 --> 1:36:36.480]  delete my entire website in the bail conditions so I was absolutely it wasn't
[1:36:36.480 --> 1:36:40.320]  even a question whether or not I could sign those bail conditions the wording
[1:36:40.320 --> 1:36:45.440]  was really interesting it said you must delete everything that incites
[1:36:45.440 --> 1:36:51.160]  opposition to the chief health officers directions which is anything that is to
[1:36:51.160 --> 1:36:55.840]  do with COVID so basically what they were saying is is not that I was inciting
[1:36:55.840 --> 1:37:01.080]  people to break show directions but that I was inciting opposition which is
[1:37:01.080 --> 1:37:05.800]  literally just me speaking out that I don't agree with things now I don't know
[1:37:05.800 --> 1:37:10.240]  about what you think about political parties but it's pretty much a political
[1:37:10.240 --> 1:37:15.400]  party's job to oppose the current government so if I had signed that bail
[1:37:15.400 --> 1:37:20.720]  conditions my whole year of work the 70,000 subscribers the seven staff that
[1:37:20.720 --> 1:37:27.080]  I had would have all been absolutely just deleted off the face of the website so I
[1:37:27.080 --> 1:37:31.520]  didn't sign it on top of that there was curfews in place for myself personally
[1:37:31.520 --> 1:37:38.240]  above any show directions so I would have to be in my home at 7 p.m. till 6
[1:37:38.240 --> 1:37:43.200]  a.m. every single day until my actual hearing which could be two years away so
[1:37:43.200 --> 1:37:48.040]  I was absolutely not willing to sign that so it was a really easy decision but
[1:37:48.040 --> 1:37:52.800]  then you know when I was on my way to prison in a prison transport truck I
[1:37:52.800 --> 1:37:57.240]  realized what I had signed myself up for but look it worked out really well and
[1:37:57.240 --> 1:38:00.560]  I wouldn't I wouldn't I don't regret anything and I wouldn't take it back and
[1:38:00.560 --> 1:38:04.000]  it's been really great for the movement here in Australia it's woken a lot of
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:08.000]  people up it's given a lot of people courage because you know not everyone
[1:38:08.000 --> 1:38:11.200]  can do the same thing because we all have different states in life and
[1:38:11.200 --> 1:38:14.920]  different abilities but everyone can do probably more than what they're doing and
[1:38:14.920 --> 1:38:19.600]  that was my calling at that moment I don't have children so I was able to go
[1:38:19.600 --> 1:38:24.400]  to prison for 22 days and no one was seriously traumatized by that so that
[1:38:24.400 --> 1:38:28.360]  was something that I could do for Australia to bring awareness internationally
[1:38:28.360 --> 1:38:32.680]  and locally to what's going on the fact that someone like me who has never been
[1:38:32.680 --> 1:38:36.760]  in trouble with the police who's respected I'm very well networked in the
[1:38:36.760 --> 1:38:41.800]  political scene in Australia and so forth and so for someone like me to go
[1:38:41.800 --> 1:38:45.040]  to prison I think it was a shock for Australia and internationally and I'm
[1:38:45.040 --> 1:38:50.120]  glad to have been given the opportunity to stand up for my for my rights because
[1:38:50.120 --> 1:38:54.760]  you know I would rather be in prison than to willingly sign away my rights
[1:38:54.760 --> 1:38:58.760]  which at the moment Australians are obviously a lot of rights are being taken
[1:38:58.760 --> 1:39:02.800]  from us. Why do you think they picked Australia because this is all scripted
[1:39:02.800 --> 1:39:07.320]  it's all a global great reset rollout they admitted is in the Debo script
[1:39:07.320 --> 1:39:12.040]  announcements and we played a clip before he came on of John Kerry the
[1:39:12.040 --> 1:39:15.920]  climates are saying oh this is a global corporate takeover this is about carbon
[1:39:15.920 --> 1:39:20.160]  this is about cutting carbon and carbon lockdowns and so it's all official that
[1:39:20.160 --> 1:39:23.520]  this was just using the virus to train you to live under a police state the
[1:39:23.520 --> 1:39:27.560]  corporations of the world are establishing a Chinese style dictatorship
[1:39:27.560 --> 1:39:31.440]  why do you think they chose Australia and then after you comment Simon can pop
[1:39:31.440 --> 1:39:35.000]  it on this you guys are free for all and why do you think they picked the south
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:41.160]  to be their most draconian of the most oppressive area well it's obvious it's
[1:39:41.160 --> 1:39:45.000]  obvious that Australia was picked because Australians are generally very
[1:39:45.000 --> 1:39:49.560]  laid-back people Australians are very friendly they're very trusting to their
[1:39:49.560 --> 1:39:55.240]  government now the Australian people could never have prepared for this they
[1:39:55.240 --> 1:39:59.120]  could they don't have guns firstly like they do in America they're unarmed and
[1:39:59.120 --> 1:40:03.320]  they trust their government you know that we've got this she'll be right my
[1:40:03.320 --> 1:40:08.800]  attitude in Australia you know people here they're more interested in watching
[1:40:08.800 --> 1:40:13.760]  the rugby or the football the cricket on TV than getting involved in politics
[1:40:13.760 --> 1:40:17.880]  when voting is compulsory a lot of people don't want to vote they just go
[1:40:17.880 --> 1:40:23.120]  because they have to so it looks like Australia has been the guinea pig for
[1:40:23.120 --> 1:40:27.200]  the rest of the world in particular the cities of Melbourne where Monica Smith
[1:40:27.200 --> 1:40:34.120]  is and Sydney where I am they've been hit very hard now they've targeted their
[1:40:34.120 --> 1:40:38.160]  experiments and their attacks on the multicultural communities on the
[1:40:38.160 --> 1:40:42.480]  religious communities we know in Australia that those communities have
[1:40:42.480 --> 1:40:46.680]  been targeted especially they've targeted churches they've closed churches
[1:40:46.680 --> 1:40:50.640]  they've closed mosques people are being denied the right to receive Holy
[1:40:50.640 --> 1:40:56.480]  Communion to pray together to go to funerals people can't say goodbye to
[1:40:56.480 --> 1:40:59.400]  their loved ones at the cemetery there are people getting arrested at the
[1:40:59.400 --> 1:41:06.200]  cemetery there are people that are being denied basic medical rights they can't
[1:41:06.200 --> 1:41:10.240]  visit their doctor they can't visit a hospital so this is an exercise in total
[1:41:10.240 --> 1:41:14.000]  martial law I want to get to miss Schmidt's take on that why do you think
[1:41:14.000 --> 1:41:17.240]  Australia was a beta test why do you think they targeted why do you think they
[1:41:17.240 --> 1:41:23.040]  targeted your town the most I think that and I and I heard Simon saying that we
[1:41:23.040 --> 1:41:28.440]  are very laid-back people and we've had it very easy we you for the last you know
[1:41:28.440 --> 1:41:32.240]  since the Eureka socket really we haven't had to fight too much for our
[1:41:32.240 --> 1:41:37.200]  freedoms and for the the the leisurely life that we live so I think we were
[1:41:37.200 --> 1:41:41.600]  perfect for it and what we are very she'll be right with nothing really
[1:41:41.600 --> 1:41:46.200]  bothers us we just you know we just grit it and we just keep going we're very
[1:41:46.200 --> 1:41:50.000]  friendly and I think that's that's one of the reasons why and I know that we're
[1:41:50.000 --> 1:41:53.440]  talking a lot about the the negative side of things and it's true we can't
[1:41:53.440 --> 1:41:58.360]  get everything that we can't do Alex is to do with our health every single thing
[1:41:58.360 --> 1:42:02.640]  we cannot do is helping our mental state so everything that helps us
[1:42:02.640 --> 1:42:08.440]  communities groups exercise everything is anti-health and it's to break our
[1:42:08.440 --> 1:42:12.760]  psychological break us psychologically so we're in a psychological warfare I
[1:42:12.760 --> 1:42:16.280]  mean you talk about that we all talk about that sometimes it's easier when
[1:42:16.280 --> 1:42:20.080]  it's actually with physical weapons because then you can see the tyranny but
[1:42:20.080 --> 1:42:24.320]  it's it's psychological and I think the way that we're going to beat it is with
[1:42:24.320 --> 1:42:28.520]  with our psyche as well so we have to have courage of conviction as a
[1:42:28.520 --> 1:42:32.920]  collective unit country and world to actually beat them because what they're
[1:42:32.920 --> 1:42:35.760]  trying to do is beat us down psychologically so that we feel like
[1:42:35.760 --> 1:42:39.520]  we've already lost because if we think we've lost well then we're gonna lose
[1:42:39.520 --> 1:42:43.680]  aren't we so that's why for those who don't know it's a standard psychological
[1:42:43.680 --> 1:42:48.560]  oppression to create mass depression and mass psychosis to put pressure on take
[1:42:48.560 --> 1:42:52.000]  pressure off put pressure on take pressure off and always squeeze down
[1:42:52.000 --> 1:42:55.000]  harder as you go
[1:43:00.440 --> 1:43:05.720]  I'll tell you what's life and death if you don't have freedom of speech if you
[1:43:05.720 --> 1:43:09.400]  don't have the right to be able to communicate then you don't have a future
[1:43:09.400 --> 1:43:13.280]  always when governments take away speech they then enslave the population
[1:43:13.280 --> 1:43:16.600]  and then they finally start exterminating the population and America the
[1:43:16.600 --> 1:43:20.560]  entire world is going down the tubes because the UN globals directed great
[1:43:20.560 --> 1:43:24.160]  reset that's why it's more important than ever that info or stay on the air and

[1:47:27.120 --> 1:47:30.760]  launched operation lockstep I mean I think it's clear you guys know that
[1:47:30.760 --> 1:47:35.000]  and your victims of it I think it's key to get the word out to leaders and
[1:47:35.000 --> 1:47:38.760]  others around the world the people that this is a war for the world as another
[1:47:38.760 --> 1:47:41.840]  Australian said this is a global corporate takeover of the planet please

[1:47:56.520 --> 1:48:00.000]  might not be able to have anyone at your funeral it's this constant not knowing
[1:48:00.000 --> 1:48:03.720]  what the government's going to do every single day tomorrow the playgrounds
[1:48:03.720 --> 1:48:07.240]  might be closed the next day it might be open and if it's open you should be
[1:48:07.240 --> 1:48:11.160]  grateful because it used to be closed but yet it's your human right anyway so
[1:48:11.160 --> 1:48:15.440]  it's it's your right it's absolutely it's such a psychological warfare it's so
[1:48:15.440 --> 1:48:20.320]  interesting but these so the last thing my premier said in Victoria Daniel Andrews
[1:48:20.320 --> 1:48:26.280]  is that we've got this roadmap out of out of lockdown right so and the
[1:48:26.280 --> 1:48:30.040]  exciting thing is is by Christmas we might be able to sit outside of cafes
[1:48:30.040 --> 1:48:35.880]  but we'll have to be vaccinated but that's absolutely illegal to enforce
[1:48:35.880 --> 1:48:39.640]  anything like that but he just says these things and hopes that people just get
[1:48:39.640 --> 1:48:42.760]  vaccinated because they want to go to a cafe but in fact it's totally
[1:48:42.760 --> 1:48:46.720]  discrimination to not let someone eat somewhere because they don't want to take
[1:48:46.720 --> 1:48:51.480]  a medical procedure but he just says it anyway so it's that coercion it's not
[1:48:51.480 --> 1:48:55.480]  especially when the shot doesn't work and isn't a vaccine and as a gene
[1:48:55.480 --> 1:48:58.880]  therapy in the countries with the highest vaccination rate have the highest
[1:48:58.880 --> 1:49:03.040]  illness rate and then Australia had almost none of these illnesses but now
[1:49:03.040 --> 1:49:05.280]  you're getting all these weird illnesses like everybody else now that they're
[1:49:05.280 --> 1:49:09.720]  taking the injections I mean this is just again a crazy corporations with a
[1:49:09.720 --> 1:49:13.840]  world government plan going for broke sorry please continue so yeah so
[1:49:13.840 --> 1:49:16.840]  basically it's just like I said they're trying to break us that's that's
[1:49:16.840 --> 1:49:20.680]  everything that I can say they want to take everything away from us that makes
[1:49:20.680 --> 1:49:25.880]  us happy connection is the number one reason why people don't get depressed
[1:49:25.880 --> 1:49:29.200]  it's a number one reason why people are depressed because they don't have enough
[1:49:29.200 --> 1:49:33.200]  connection so they are trying to basically make the entire nation of
[1:49:33.200 --> 1:49:38.240]  Australia depressed so that we will do whatever they say now tyrants don't
[1:49:38.240 --> 1:49:43.680]  negotiate okay so when when the people find a way around the system which they
[1:49:43.680 --> 1:49:48.000]  have in Victoria they set up cocktail a cocktail route around the city that was
[1:49:48.000 --> 1:49:51.480]  all outside and people were wearing masks and everything and our premier said
[1:49:51.480 --> 1:49:55.960]  you can't do that you can't drink cocktails you have to you know and so
[1:49:55.960 --> 1:50:00.960]  these tyrants they actually get worse the cleverer other people get so they're
[1:50:00.960 --> 1:50:04.200]  just trying to break us and we're not going to break Alex so they can do
[1:50:04.200 --> 1:50:08.640]  whatever they want trying to break you for what though to accept the carbon
[1:50:08.640 --> 1:50:13.880]  tax the ID the digital app but I mean it's so damn obvious cross swap says we
[1:50:13.880 --> 1:50:17.880]  will make them very angry until they submit to great reset as if we don't
[1:50:17.880 --> 1:50:24.360]  know he's the one doing it for the great reset Simon yeah definitely in
[1:50:24.360 --> 1:50:28.440]  regards to what can be done I mean the Australian people are doing whatever they
[1:50:28.440 --> 1:50:33.440]  can do you mentioned something earlier Alex which has really sparked my
[1:50:33.440 --> 1:50:37.920]  interest I know a lot of our Australian viewers would be very very grateful for
[1:50:37.920 --> 1:50:42.840]  this you said that you're willing to go to the Australian embassy in Washington
[1:50:42.840 --> 1:50:48.840]  and do some kind of a political protest now I just want to underscore I'm sure
[1:50:48.840 --> 1:50:52.240]  Monica would agree with me here and so with millions of Australians who are
[1:50:52.240 --> 1:50:57.360]  going to be watching this that is such a great thing that is exactly what we need
[1:50:57.360 --> 1:51:03.720]  we need for our friends and our allies overseas especially the Americans were
[1:51:03.720 --> 1:51:07.400]  very close to Australia to point the finger at the Australian government and
[1:51:07.400 --> 1:51:14.520]  say no this is wrong what you're doing is wrong it's against all you know the
[1:51:14.520 --> 1:51:18.840]  values of Western civilization it's against Christian values it's against
[1:51:18.840 --> 1:51:24.440]  the basic principles of freedom and human rights so just maybe a counter
[1:51:24.440 --> 1:51:27.800]  question to you if you could if you could take this opportunity to evaluate
[1:51:27.800 --> 1:51:31.800]  and obviously there will be many other millions of Americans who potentially
[1:51:31.800 --> 1:51:35.680]  could visit the Australian embassy visit the Australian consulate you know
[1:51:35.680 --> 1:51:40.560]  bring the American flags bring whatever Aussie flags bring signs we would love
[1:51:40.560 --> 1:51:44.080]  to see that absolutely well I mean when I say I'm gonna do something I'm gonna do
[1:51:44.080 --> 1:51:47.840]  it and it may take a couple weeks so I'm gonna build this up I may go to New
[1:51:47.840 --> 1:51:51.600]  York you know I thought about going in protest because Bolsonaro said I could
[1:51:51.600 --> 1:51:56.120]  interview him in in Brazil and I didn't think oh he's there I should have gone
[1:51:56.120 --> 1:52:01.120]  interviewed him but I was in DC for the January 6 protesters that are bunch were
[1:52:01.120 --> 1:52:04.120]  nonviolent still held in solitary confinement and so I didn't go to that
[1:52:04.120 --> 1:52:08.440]  but I could either we could have a protest at the UN and there's also an
[1:52:08.440 --> 1:52:13.160]  Australian consulate I know in New York or we can do the one in DC or do both but
[1:52:13.160 --> 1:52:18.080]  yeah we need to get everybody out to do that because that's something the press
[1:52:18.080 --> 1:52:23.040]  is going to cover and they're they're watching and testing again in Australia
[1:52:23.040 --> 1:52:29.960]  and in the 50th state of Hawaii as well is under a very draconian system so they
[1:52:29.960 --> 1:52:34.160]  love islands because you have nowhere to run we really need the international community to
[1:52:34.160 --> 1:52:38.240]  step up here look Australia has been helping countries all around the world
[1:52:38.240 --> 1:52:42.080]  our troops have been going overseas Australia's been donating money and
[1:52:42.080 --> 1:52:46.920]  aid and you know for all sorts of natural disasters and so forth Australia's
[1:52:46.920 --> 1:52:51.160]  never really asked for help you know the Australian people right now sir you're
[1:52:51.160 --> 1:52:56.440]  under globalist New World Order takeover is a scientific test you are us
[1:52:56.440 --> 1:53:01.280]  you're like part of our heart or arm and we are yours they're attacking me right
[1:53:01.280 --> 1:53:07.600]  now when they attack you and when they threw miss Schmidt into that gulag can
[1:53:07.600 --> 1:53:11.160]  you speak to that this is only the beginning they've been putting people
[1:53:11.160 --> 1:53:16.760]  on incitement charges for a year so this has been their tactic to actually
[1:53:16.760 --> 1:53:20.520]  silence people who have a platform so you would have heard of Craig Kelly as
[1:53:20.520 --> 1:53:25.520]  well he's a he's a political member of Parliament he was taken off Facebook he
[1:53:25.520 --> 1:53:29.520]  gets slammed in the media all the time so this is just the beginning they're
[1:53:29.520 --> 1:53:33.520]  trying to obviously stop people from speaking out of fear that they will get
[1:53:33.520 --> 1:53:37.360]  treated really badly from the media and so forth and then of course with the
[1:53:37.360 --> 1:53:41.560]  protests as the days went on the police got more and more brutal seemingly to
[1:53:41.560 --> 1:53:46.040]  try and scare people so this is just the beginning and tyrants don't negotiate
[1:53:46.040 --> 1:53:50.120]  they just get harder so it is gonna get harder this is not the end at all so
[1:53:50.120 --> 1:53:54.320]  anything America can do would be absolutely fantastic because I don't
[1:53:54.320 --> 1:53:58.240]  know maybe some people are gonna have to die for this you know it's getting
[1:53:58.240 --> 1:54:03.080]  really serious here the protesting is it's very violent and it's not coming
[1:54:03.080 --> 1:54:07.440]  from the people it's coming from the police but the people have to defend
[1:54:07.440 --> 1:54:11.360]  themselves as well so it's a very difficult situation here and I would love
[1:54:11.360 --> 1:54:16.800]  to be able to stop that from happening escalating into into actual vile like
[1:54:16.800 --> 1:54:20.120]  actual death and things like that but it's it's heading that way unfortunately
[1:54:20.120 --> 1:54:24.520]  all right now going to final comments take as much time as you like I was
[1:54:24.520 --> 1:54:27.840]  talking over you earlier and I'd like to put a promo out with you you know a
[1:54:27.840 --> 1:54:31.160]  saying Monica Schmidt that same thing you said they want to break us they're
[1:54:31.160 --> 1:54:34.000]  not gonna break us and of course I started interrupting like I do because I
[1:54:34.000 --> 1:54:37.560]  get so excited restate that force to make any other great points you'd like to
[1:54:37.560 --> 1:54:41.360]  impart to several million people that are gonna watch this
[1:54:41.360 --> 1:54:45.760]  sure well thanks for the opportunity so look the tyranny and the violence from
[1:54:45.760 --> 1:54:50.280]  the police and the obvious draconian measures of the premiers are they're
[1:54:50.280 --> 1:54:53.400]  obvious you know you can see them in black and white but what they really
[1:54:53.400 --> 1:54:57.400]  want to do is break our soul and break our minds break our will because then
[1:54:57.400 --> 1:55:01.360]  we're very easy to control you know it's like with the vaccine if you don't want
[1:55:01.360 --> 1:55:05.680]  to take it but you take it to go to cafes or to appease your government or to
[1:55:05.680 --> 1:55:09.560]  keep your job you lose a little bit of your soul every single time you do
[1:55:09.560 --> 1:55:14.000]  something that you know is against your conviction basically so every single
[1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:17.960]  method every single thing that these premiers are doing are really designed
[1:55:17.960 --> 1:55:22.160]  to break our soul just like an animal or a dog or like you know how they train
[1:55:22.160 --> 1:55:27.240]  elephants some in those tourist countries it's all just psychological so for me
[1:55:27.240 --> 1:55:32.760]  and what I realized in in prison and what I did with you know utilizing my
[1:55:32.760 --> 1:55:37.400]  courage of conviction is it actually beat them in that moment that they tried
[1:55:37.400 --> 1:55:40.480]  to silence me and instead of silencing me they actually made my voice
[1:55:40.480 --> 1:55:45.040]  international and bigger so it actually did the exact opposite so what I
[1:55:45.040 --> 1:55:49.200]  realized in prison Alex is one of the biggest thing I realized is that courage
[1:55:49.200 --> 1:55:54.440]  of collective courage of conviction is going to be the only way that the world
[1:55:54.440 --> 1:55:59.840]  is going to beat the agenda now obviously you've said the agenda is in full
[1:55:59.840 --> 1:56:03.760]  swing it has been for decades and we are definitely behind the eight ball because
[1:56:03.760 --> 1:56:07.520]  we were all enjoying our lives and families and our communities and not
[1:56:07.520 --> 1:56:10.640]  thinking that this would happen in our lifetime and maybe a next generation
[1:56:10.640 --> 1:56:13.920]  would have to deal with it but here it is it's not our fault that it's here but
[1:56:13.920 --> 1:56:17.560]  it is our fault to do something about it and the only way that we can is to have
[1:56:17.560 --> 1:56:22.040]  our own individual courage of conviction in our own states in life in our own
[1:56:22.040 --> 1:56:25.920]  lifestyles with our own abilities everyone can do more that's what I did
[1:56:25.920 --> 1:56:29.080]  and this is what you're doing this is your this is your role in the fight
[1:56:29.080 --> 1:56:33.200]  Alex and everyone has their own role whether small or big so for me it's if
[1:56:33.200 --> 1:56:37.400]  you want to get them you know if you want to spite them then have courage of
[1:56:37.400 --> 1:56:42.160]  conviction and just say no and guess what you'll love it you're super empowered
[1:56:42.160 --> 1:56:45.960]  and you become a better person for it and you'll never look back so that would
[1:56:45.960 --> 1:56:51.200]  be my last comment Alex and we will win I believe we will win beautifully said
[1:56:51.200 --> 1:56:55.880]  thank you again what time is it in your region of Australia right now I think
[1:56:55.880 --> 1:57:00.240]  it's it's quarter past five okay so the birds are about to wake up all right
[1:57:00.240 --> 1:57:03.720]  well I hope to someday visit you when Australia is a free country I always
[1:57:03.720 --> 1:57:06.640]  wanted to do it I've just been so busy in the fight here knowing this was
[1:57:06.640 --> 1:57:09.240]  coming because it's in their own documents I'm sure you've seen this but
[1:57:09.240 --> 1:57:12.960]  Klaus Schwab says we're we've captured all the democracies we've captured the
[1:57:12.960 --> 1:57:17.240]  countries so he's dynamically opposed to your reignite democracy movement so it
[1:57:17.240 --> 1:57:20.920]  should be quite easy of you to explain to people this is an outside force and
[1:57:20.920 --> 1:57:24.680]  everybody should duplicate what you're doing in their countries like Canada and
[1:57:24.680 --> 1:57:28.480]  in blue cities in the US and Europe and should create these registries of people
[1:57:28.480 --> 1:57:32.360]  that stand free and open to band together their strength in that all right
[1:57:32.360 --> 1:57:35.920]  Monica I really want to thank you congratulations on getting engaged thank
[1:57:35.920 --> 1:57:40.440]  you so much for joining us thank you so much Alex have a great day thank you
[1:57:40.440 --> 1:57:43.400]  Monica Schmidt Wow
[1:57:49.960 --> 1:57:58.720]  the answer to 1984 is 1776
[1:57:58.720 --> 1:58:11.920]  Info wars has been banned arrested
[1:58:12.840 --> 1:58:21.400]  attacked and threatened because we are effective the great awakening is here go
[1:58:21.400 --> 1:58:29.680]  to band.video download the videos and share support the information war at
[1:58:29.680 --> 1:58:38.440]  infowarstore.com and never give up the fight
[1:58:38.440 --> 1:58:56.640]  the puppet leaders of nations across the planet are declaring their
[1:58:56.640 --> 1:59:01.440]  allegiance to the New World Order and Democrat politicians have been
[1:59:01.440 --> 1:59:06.520]  announcing it here as well that means allegiance to a tyrannical world
[1:59:06.520 --> 1:59:11.080]  corporate government established by the Rockefellers through the UN and they
[1:59:11.080 --> 1:59:14.880]  want inside your bodies to put in you what they want when they want and to
[1:59:14.880 --> 1:59:20.840]  have the global digital tracking COVID passes or vaccine passes to form the
[1:59:20.840 --> 1:59:26.160]  backbone of their new world ID and now their puppet body has announced the
[1:59:26.160 --> 1:59:29.920]  forced inoculation of 100 million Americans to keep their jobs in total
[1:59:29.920 --> 1:59:34.880]  violation of the Nuremberg code this is criminal and he's lying saying it's an
[1:59:34.880 --> 1:59:39.160]  approved vaccine when they did not approve it they say that's a 20-25 maybe
[1:59:39.160 --> 1:59:42.760]  they just expanded the emergency authorization that's why the two top
[1:59:42.760 --> 1:59:47.000]  scientists quit a week and a half ago well you live to see an absolute new
[1:59:47.000 --> 1:59:52.440]  world order world government if you submit they will totally enslave you
[1:59:52.440 --> 2:00:06.020]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show and show and show and show and show and
[2:00:06.020 --> 2:00:14.560]  And so, and so, and so, and so, and so, and so.
