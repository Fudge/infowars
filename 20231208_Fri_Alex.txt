[00:00:18.084 --> 00:00:30.494]  So that's why the WEF and the UN are coming in in Ireland and in areas of Asia and in the Netherlands and saying, by 2030, 80% of your cows have got to be dead.
[00:00:30.734 --> 00:00:30.994]  I think so.
[00:00:47.669 --> 00:01:03.538]  That the big banks on record brag, they've penetrated the cabinets to quote Klaus Schwab, they've put their operatives in to cut off our energy, demoralize us, release the hardened criminals, put the political activists in prison, continue to cut off the resources to make an angrier world.
[00:01:03.558 --> 00:01:11.783]  Klaus Schwab says, we're going to make the world collapse, we're going to have everybody turn against each other, we're going to blame the political classes that we own and control
[00:01:12.543 --> 00:01:15.124]  And then when we're done, we'll bring in our new solution.
[00:01:15.624 --> 00:01:30.129]  But first, they have to demolish the cultures and societies that we had before with the fentanyl, with the open borders, with the demoralization, and then they bring in their next phase, which is a high-tech, cashless society, robot, drone-controlled nightmare.
[00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.530]  More than half of the U.S.
[00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:33.751]  in their official UN maps
[00:01:34.738 --> 00:01:36.079]  That they've had for more than 25 years.
[00:01:36.379 --> 00:01:37.439]  They're in some of my first films.
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.640]  Show half the U.S.
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:40.801]  off limits to humans.
[00:01:42.101 --> 00:01:43.542]  All cars will have to have GPS.
[00:01:43.702 --> 00:01:45.763]  Everybody, by law, will have to have a cell phone at all times.
[00:01:46.143 --> 00:01:47.484]  Australia just did this last year.
[00:01:48.524 --> 00:01:49.244]  Tried to push it through.
[00:01:49.905 --> 00:01:51.646]  And that's the admitted global U.N.
[00:01:51.686 --> 00:01:54.307]  standardized plan, where you don't leave your house without a cell phone.
[00:01:54.767 --> 00:01:55.387]  Every car is
[00:01:57.208 --> 00:01:59.250]  Robot kill switch, GPS controlled.
[00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.011]  California is moving to ban all the quote classic cars.
[00:02:02.472 --> 00:02:07.756]  That's any car that doesn't have a digital ignition and they admit it's for control.
[00:02:08.136 --> 00:02:13.199]  So if people think things are bad now, the straitjacket, the ball and chain is going on.
[00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:14.741]  It's all being militarily run.
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:22.728]  Our military's great men and women, but at the top, our military has been globalist, trained, New World Order people for at least 30, 40 years.
[00:02:23.028 --> 00:02:30.516]  They've got almost every general, every person under their control, and that's why it came out in the UK and Europe and also here in Canada.
[00:02:31.197 --> 00:02:31.998]  You pulled the headlines.
[00:02:33.383 --> 00:02:39.206]  Defense Department purposely scared public into lockdowns, masking, and taking inoculations.
[00:02:39.907 --> 00:02:40.607]  UK headline.
[00:02:41.287 --> 00:02:44.729]  British Ministry of Defense secretly brainwashed and terrorized public.
[00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.350]  Canada, same headline.
[00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.732]  They even let you know, oh, the military is here to do this.
[00:02:50.032 --> 00:02:56.676]  And now the CIA and Justice Department is there to help surveil the public to stop disinformation.
[00:02:57.136 --> 00:02:59.817]  And it turned out, of course, almost all the disinformation was true.
[00:03:00.638 --> 00:03:00.978]  Always.
[00:03:01.278 --> 00:03:01.899]  About everything.
[00:03:03.302 --> 00:03:05.584]  We have to understand, our governments have been seized.
[00:03:06.145 --> 00:03:09.328]  The big corporations want to get rid of the American idea.
[00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:17.297]  You've got 50 acres, and your house, and a business, and a farm, and you can take care of your family, and you're independent.
[00:03:17.897 --> 00:03:21.862]  They have to destroy all that, because the rest of the world aspires to that.
[00:03:22.222 --> 00:03:23.703]  Instead, they want 15 minute cities.
[00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.052]  Central Bank Digital Currencies.
[00:03:27.114 --> 00:03:35.608]  They want all of these systems that track and trace everything you do on the social credit scores and
[00:03:37.071 --> 00:03:49.615]  The plan of the rest of the public, we're talking 99%, is 250 square foot coffin apartments, 5G bathing you in them, literally eating bug protein.
[00:03:50.455 --> 00:03:55.597]  You see the system, the media going after Biden, and he deserves it, but they were covering it up until now.
[00:03:55.977 --> 00:04:03.259]  Now they're covering the laptop, now they're covering attacking the dog, now they're covering all of his senility, all the corruption, the Chinese spies.
[00:04:03.279 --> 00:04:04.299]  Attacking a dog?
[00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:05.300]  What a pig he is.
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:06.180]  I'm sorry.
[00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.562]  Well, I mean, I was told that by Secret Service and by people that, let's just say, work with them.
[00:04:11.582 --> 00:04:13.203]  And I'm going to leave it at that.
[00:04:13.803 --> 00:04:14.763]  I actually have a contact for you.
[00:04:14.783 --> 00:04:15.864]  You'll actually be able to hear it from them.
[00:04:15.884 --> 00:04:17.605]  But when this is over, I'll let you actually hear it from yourself.
[00:04:17.865 --> 00:04:18.665]  I think they'll tell you off record.
[00:04:18.685 --> 00:04:19.525]  I think they're willing to talk to you.
[00:04:20.226 --> 00:04:22.247]  But yeah, he is completely out of his mind.
[00:04:22.487 --> 00:04:27.029]  He wanders around for the entire two and a half years, it's getting worse, naked in the White House.
[00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:30.090]  In the middle of the night, doesn't know who he is.
[00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.551]  They had to give him a bunch of drugs, a bunch of amphetamines in the morning.
[00:04:33.871 --> 00:04:34.832]  Then they've got a drugging
[00:04:35.672 --> 00:04:37.253]  Uh, at night, sometimes he's gotta go.
[00:04:37.493 --> 00:04:40.515]  He'll like, be out for the morning for a while, and then comes back out at night for a ball.
[00:04:40.835 --> 00:04:41.756]  That's when there's a real problem.
[00:04:41.776 --> 00:04:42.556]  He is on drugs.
[00:04:42.636 --> 00:04:43.497]  I have established that.
[00:04:43.637 --> 00:04:45.338]  I know someone who witnessed it.
[00:04:45.538 --> 00:04:46.478]  I'm not guessing at this.
[00:04:46.558 --> 00:04:51.521]  I know someone personally who witnessed him, uh, taking amphetamines.
[00:04:52.001 --> 00:04:55.644]  And this was, this was during the 2016, uh, 2020 election.
[00:04:55.864 --> 00:04:57.124]  So how's this gonna, that's huge.
[00:04:57.184 --> 00:04:59.606]  I know you don't play games, you've been... No, I don't play games with...
[00:05:01.368 --> 00:05:04.852]  Never forget that the answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:05:06.234 --> 00:05:10.459]  We've come a long way in the fight against tyranny, and it's been listeners and viewers like you that have kept us on air.

[00:05:20.851 --> 00:05:23.952]  And here we are, another Christmas is here, being the biggest sale of the year.

[00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.222]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:29.662 --> 00:06:34.946]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:06:36.248 --> 00:06:37.649]  It's Friday, December 8th, 2023.
[00:06:37.829 --> 00:06:39.270]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:43.053]  I want to welcome the giant new audience tuning in.
[00:06:43.433 --> 00:06:52.641]  The Tucker interview that dropped yesterday is the biggest story on the internet right now, really affecting change and warning the planet about the globalist depopulation plan.
[00:06:54.395 --> 00:06:55.356]  And so much more.
[00:06:55.496 --> 00:07:00.761]  Owen Schroyer got out of prison about 15 days early this morning.
[00:07:00.821 --> 00:07:02.442]  Our crew picked him up in Louisiana.
[00:07:02.482 --> 00:07:07.727]  He'll be joining us from the road via video link coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:07:07.767 --> 00:07:11.190]  But here's the opening salvo from the Tucker Alex Jones interview.
[00:07:12.825 --> 00:07:16.786]  You look at the trajectory of this, how they're escalating on Trump, whether you love him or hate him.
[00:07:17.046 --> 00:07:18.487]  He's now a populist icon.
[00:07:19.387 --> 00:07:20.607]  He's now the underdog.
[00:07:21.248 --> 00:07:22.668]  The globalists are coming after him.
[00:07:22.688 --> 00:07:24.549]  They're coming after our right to vote for who we want.
[00:07:24.869 --> 00:07:28.030]  He gets 60% against all... Which is the fundamental right of a democracy.
[00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:29.450]  The people rule.
[00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:31.271]  I can vote for whomever I want.
[00:07:31.331 --> 00:07:34.072]  And if you don't like that person, that's immaterial, right?
[00:07:34.112 --> 00:07:34.472]  Absolutely.
[00:07:34.692 --> 00:07:37.253]  And he's been indicted for saying they're stealing elections.
[00:07:37.513 --> 00:07:39.433]  They're stealing it trying... Oh, I'm aware.
[00:07:40.073 --> 00:07:40.414]  Absolutely.
[00:07:40.474 --> 00:07:41.534]  And they're indictments of him!
[00:07:42.034 --> 00:07:43.694]  His election theft, but yes.
[00:07:45.555 --> 00:07:48.535]  But despite that, he's got 60% against all other Republicans.
[00:07:48.876 --> 00:07:50.616]  He's 15, 20 points ahead of Biden.
[00:07:51.216 --> 00:07:53.717]  It's backfired, but the deep state's not going to stop.
[00:07:53.757 --> 00:08:02.338]  So when you said to Trump several times in that 400 million views, whatever you got, biggest show ever, you said to him, well, is it the next thing that I'm trying to kill you?
[00:08:02.378 --> 00:08:05.279]  And he's so confident, he doesn't want to think about that.
[00:08:05.299 --> 00:08:06.999]  He doesn't want to think about it.
[00:08:07.119 --> 00:08:09.060]  Whereas I admire someone that's that confident.
[00:08:10.009 --> 00:08:11.450]  I don't see Biden and Trump
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:29.621]  Attacking a dog?
[00:08:29.781 --> 00:08:30.481]  What a pig he is!
[00:08:47.577 --> 00:08:59.639]  By the way, just to show how deceptive the corporate media is, a whole bunch of publications, I think I left it out there in the printer, those stories, I print them out for when I'm live, give them to me guys, said Jones is making up that Biden is mean to his dog.
[00:09:00.219 --> 00:09:05.280]  It's come out in mainstream news and he's been caught on video kicking it and that it attacks the Secret Service.
[00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:12.182]  I mean, we talk about all these things that are real and they sit there and deny that they're doing it, down to Biden.
[00:09:13.002 --> 00:09:13.182]  But,
[00:09:14.397 --> 00:09:17.619]  The establishment's backing of Biden has come to an end.
[00:09:17.639 --> 00:09:26.022]  Hunter Biden faces 17 years in prison after spending millions on lavish, hard-parting lifestyles while dodging taxes.
[00:09:26.042 --> 00:09:29.484]  Yeah, a bunch of hookers and cocaine.
[00:09:30.124 --> 00:09:41.790]  House Republicans unveil resolution to authorize Biden impeachment inquiry, and the Speaker says he's going to let that continue to roll forward.
[00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:45.902]  We've got a lot to get into here today.
[00:09:45.962 --> 00:09:51.546]  Western aid to Ukraine falls off a cliff, according to International German Monitor Group.
[00:09:52.507 --> 00:09:56.129]  And the response is not just Biden two days ago saying, well, we'll just go to war with Russia.
[00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:59.292]  Now the Secretary of Defense, Tucker Carlson, broke.
[00:09:59.312 --> 00:10:04.916]  They have the sources told a closed door meeting of Congress that
[00:10:07.136 --> 00:10:13.137]  Our sons and daughters will die soon if we don't give them $106 billion.
[00:10:15.598 --> 00:10:21.779]  So total blackmail by these criminals will be breaking all of this down today.
[00:10:21.839 --> 00:10:25.860]  Studies show vaccinated are more likely to suffer from ear disease.
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:27.480]  That's what everybody keeps reporting with tinnitus.
[00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:29.761]  Blood disorders and hair loss.
[00:10:29.881 --> 00:10:30.181]  Yeah.
[00:10:31.275 --> 00:10:31.595]  It's just
[00:10:52.142 --> 00:10:52.662]  Incredible.
[00:10:52.722 --> 00:10:55.383]  The exploding cardiovascular situation.
[00:10:55.423 --> 00:10:56.984]  It's just unbelievable they actually did it.
[00:10:57.004 --> 00:10:58.745]  I mean, I find it hard to believe.
[00:10:58.765 --> 00:11:02.927]  And that's what they're counting on, is it's so horrible, so crazy, so over the top.
[00:11:03.487 --> 00:11:04.007]  The Netherlands.
[00:11:04.187 --> 00:11:07.128]  Oh, by 2030, 90% of all cows will be killed in the Netherlands.
[00:11:07.468 --> 00:11:08.629]  Killed 30% this year.
[00:11:08.649 --> 00:11:10.630]  80% of people in polls are against it.
[00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:15.152]  They roll tanks and troops in and beat and attack the farmers and just start slaughtering their cows.
[00:11:15.472 --> 00:11:16.592]  And it's barely even on the news.
[00:11:17.173 --> 00:11:18.973]  Now Ireland's going to kill their cows.
[00:11:19.053 --> 00:11:20.034]  I mean, it's just...
[00:11:20.956 --> 00:11:21.957]  It's just insane.
[00:11:22.017 --> 00:11:23.037]  It doesn't sound real.
[00:11:23.478 --> 00:11:26.480]  I remember like two years ago, the document came out of the Department of Energy.
[00:11:27.581 --> 00:11:36.787]  They said, yeah, we're going to have regulations in 2023 to ban the new production of gas range stoves.
[00:11:37.668 --> 00:11:39.229]  They went, oh, no, that's a conspiracy theory.
[00:11:39.289 --> 00:11:40.209]  That was a real memo.
[00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:42.271]  And now they're saying, yes, we want it.
[00:11:42.531 --> 00:11:45.113]  And New York just banned them or began the process.
[00:11:45.613 --> 00:11:46.554]  I mean, it's just
[00:11:47.836 --> 00:11:49.276]  It's always the same tactics.
[00:11:49.416 --> 00:11:51.337]  Like, oh, we don't want illegal aliens to vote.
[00:11:51.937 --> 00:11:55.658]  And then over 100 jurisdictions have passed laws that illegal aliens can vote, all Democrat.
[00:11:57.378 --> 00:11:58.398]  Oh, there's no caravans.
[00:11:58.418 --> 00:11:59.558]  Remember just three, four years ago?
[00:11:59.618 --> 00:12:00.619]  Oh, Trump's making it up.
[00:12:01.019 --> 00:12:02.139]  There's no caravans.
[00:12:02.239 --> 00:12:03.739]  Jon Stewart, there's no caravans.
[00:12:04.819 --> 00:12:07.900]  Giant 100,000 person caravan slamming into the border every month.
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:09.861]  Now it's every week.
[00:12:11.141 --> 00:12:14.221]  I mean, it is insane asylum level.
[00:12:15.742 --> 00:12:16.562]  Total, complete.
[00:12:17.577 --> 00:12:18.457]  Insane asylum level.
[00:12:18.498 --> 00:12:28.243]  You know I like to drive down to South Texas but really I like West Texas and every three or four months I like to drive out to Big Bend and just it's it's Old West out there.
[00:12:28.263 --> 00:12:31.985]  If you're in a car wreck cops aren't coming for two hours.
[00:12:32.005 --> 00:12:34.486]  I mean it's it's it's cool because you're all by yourself.
[00:12:35.747 --> 00:12:38.968]  And they got a checkpoint 70 miles in to the country.
[00:12:39.269 --> 00:12:41.089]  That's in the federal law they can do that.
[00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:43.731]  And when they drive you through the checkpoint
[00:12:44.983 --> 00:12:46.405]  They ask what you're doing, where you're going.
[00:12:46.425 --> 00:12:49.789]  I just look at them every time and I go, you know the border's wide open.
[00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:51.852]  And you know I'm a citizen.
[00:12:52.553 --> 00:12:53.714]  I'm not smuggling any kids.
[00:12:53.774 --> 00:12:55.697]  So don't ask me where I'm a citizen.
[00:12:55.717 --> 00:12:56.417]  You can tell I am.
[00:12:56.918 --> 00:12:57.559]  They go, you're right.
[00:12:57.619 --> 00:12:58.720]  Just laugh and wade me through.
[00:12:59.918 --> 00:13:14.861]  And I'm not disrespecting the Border Patrol, I'm just not going to sit there while they cut open the barbed wire fences and run bulldozers over it in front of us and have the federal courts order our governor to stop trying to secure it and then they still want to ask me if I'm a citizen?
[00:13:16.261 --> 00:13:20.162]  And the last time I was down there, the guy goes, alright Alex, have a good day.
[00:13:20.182 --> 00:13:21.402]  Because he always knows who I am.
[00:13:21.802 --> 00:13:24.362]  And I'm like, yeah, why are you asking me if I'm a U.S.
[00:13:24.402 --> 00:13:26.963]  citizen and why are you asking what's in my car?
[00:13:28.598 --> 00:13:31.399]  I'm just like, let's not keep the facade going here.
[00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:33.060]  The charade.
[00:13:35.221 --> 00:13:35.881]  This is a lie.
[00:13:37.442 --> 00:13:42.384]  Now, if they were doing their job and actually securing it, they wanted to ask me questions and check or whatever, I'd be like, sure.
[00:13:42.404 --> 00:13:44.385]  Because maybe I'm smuggling drugs or something.
[00:13:44.925 --> 00:13:49.847]  But the damn thing's open at the border, so I don't want to be 70 miles in the United States.
[00:13:50.467 --> 00:13:52.068]  Federal law, they can do up to 100 miles in.
[00:13:52.668 --> 00:13:54.049]  I'm just not playing along with you, man.
[00:13:54.289 --> 00:13:56.830]  If you don't want to get preached at, then wave me through.
[00:13:58.561 --> 00:14:00.943]  Just leave me alone.
[00:14:01.803 --> 00:14:03.845]  I'm not playing along with this game.
[00:14:06.787 --> 00:14:10.009]  Now, they started actually arresting and executing fentanyl dealers.
[00:14:10.069 --> 00:14:13.451]  I'd be like, yeah, pull me over, search my car, because I'm coming in out of the border.
[00:14:13.731 --> 00:14:15.773]  Fine, I don't have fentanyl, but that's not going on, folks.
[00:14:16.193 --> 00:14:20.956]  They're letting it all through, and I'm going to just stop ranting.
[00:14:22.738 --> 00:14:24.099]  Yesterday, I've been on air.
[00:14:25.404 --> 00:14:27.205]  It'll be 29 years in April.
[00:14:27.905 --> 00:14:29.225]  No, 30 years in April.
[00:14:29.305 --> 00:14:29.625]  In 29 years.
[00:14:29.645 --> 00:14:36.487]  It'll be 30 years in April that I first started getting on shows and going and speaking to city council and county commission and all the rest of it.
[00:14:36.527 --> 00:14:38.588]  I was 20 years old.
[00:14:40.629 --> 00:14:41.029]  20 years old.
[00:14:43.009 --> 00:14:45.850]  And so, we should have some type of bookmarker.
[00:14:47.111 --> 00:14:50.392]  I'm not a big guy into like, you know, celebrating things or having toast or
[00:14:51.788 --> 00:14:53.529]  A bunch of pomp and circumstance.
[00:14:53.549 --> 00:15:00.172]  But I think 30 years of this operation is a big deal.
[00:15:00.192 --> 00:15:02.913]  25 years of Infowars when he came up with that name and launched that.
[00:15:03.774 --> 00:15:06.315]  Vic Vreeland, Deputy Fire Chief, had the idea.
[00:15:06.875 --> 00:15:08.396]  Told me I should have a website and help me set it up.
[00:15:08.736 --> 00:15:09.296]  That's his idea.
[00:15:09.316 --> 00:15:10.837]  I always give credit to the Hoots too.
[00:15:10.857 --> 00:15:13.858]  People are like, Jones must be an operative.
[00:15:13.878 --> 00:15:15.259]  He had the perfect name, Infowar.
[00:15:15.979 --> 00:15:19.441]  Well, I mean, Vic Vreeland was in Air Force Intelligence in Vietnam and did a bunch of stuff.
[00:15:22.517 --> 00:15:23.078]  It's his idea.
[00:15:23.859 --> 00:15:25.762]  And he said, we're the people's Infowar.
[00:15:26.804 --> 00:15:29.488]  But that was the type of guys I got educated by.
[00:15:29.508 --> 00:15:30.529]  There's so many of them.
[00:15:31.651 --> 00:15:34.435]  They're the only reason we're here today.
[00:15:34.696 --> 00:15:35.557]  All those great people.
[00:15:36.297 --> 00:15:37.798]  I called Vic like five years ago.
[00:15:37.818 --> 00:15:39.360]  I don't even know if he's alive now.
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:40.461]  Bastrop, he's really old now.
[00:15:40.641 --> 00:15:41.302]  Maybe he's gone wild.
[00:15:41.362 --> 00:15:41.722]  I don't know.
[00:15:42.443 --> 00:15:43.063]  I said, please come on.
[00:15:43.103 --> 00:15:46.026]  He said, Alex, we love you, but man, we're retired and we're really old, buddy.
[00:15:46.767 --> 00:15:47.508]  So we're proud of you.
[00:15:47.528 --> 00:15:47.908]  Good luck.
[00:15:47.968 --> 00:15:50.690]  If you ever want to come by and have a glass of lemonade, go ahead.
[00:15:51.311 --> 00:15:52.532]  I should have gone out there.
[00:15:52.552 --> 00:15:53.053]  I didn't do it.
[00:15:53.593 --> 00:15:53.913]  All right.
[00:15:53.974 --> 00:15:55.835]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:55.855 --> 00:15:56.236]  Stay with us.
[00:15:59.978 --> 00:16:09.130]  What would you do if there was a tyrannical totalitarian world government taking over whose plan was to kill 90% of the world population and they were already beginning to do it?
[00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:10.492]  You would rally against it?
[00:16:10.512 --> 00:16:11.032]  You would fight it?
[00:16:11.413 --> 00:16:12.774]  And that's what we're doing.
[00:16:13.255 --> 00:16:14.356]  This is the reality of 2023.
[00:16:15.578 --> 00:16:30.266]  I just want to thank listeners and viewers for your last year's support, and I want to encourage you now more than ever to spread the word about the broadcast, to pray for the broadcast, to take clips and share it from the broadcast, and to buy products that enrich your life at InfoWarsaw.com.
[00:16:30.626 --> 00:16:36.930]  We have the signed or unsigned copy of my new book, The Great Awakening, The Plan to Defeat the Globalist and Launch the Second Renaissance.
[00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:42.612]  One of the most frustrating things about being awake to the globalist agenda is seeing the general public still asleep.
[00:17:07.973 --> 00:17:20.939]  By and large, not aware of the magnitude of the incredible danger they're under, but also the ongoing attacks and the magnitude of the death caused by the lethal injections, masqueradings, vaccines.
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:29.884]  It is so frustrating to see people going about their daily lives oblivious, and you realize ignorance is not bliss, it equals death.
[00:17:31.727 --> 00:17:52.154]  But people are starting to really understand how serious things are, and that's a hard thing to do, because to wake up to a dystopic reality and realize that we're in the middle of a giant biological weapons war against humanity, and that there's mass sterilization that's already taking place, and they're cutting off all the major energy sources, is really hard to deal with, but it's the reality.
[00:17:52.694 --> 00:17:56.895]  Facing it is our only chance to turn this around, because stuff's about to get really, really nasty.
[00:17:57.296 --> 00:17:57.936]  Infowars.com.
[00:17:59.932 --> 00:18:07.936]  We have not had this many of our best-selling products back in stock in years because of supply chain breakdowns and all the rest of the stuff that's going on.
[00:18:08.176 --> 00:18:09.637]  And these are game-changing products.
[00:18:09.657 --> 00:18:11.458]  It's like our information's game-changing.
[00:18:11.498 --> 00:18:12.719]  These products are incredible.
[00:18:13.699 --> 00:18:16.261]  And I'm personally glad that these are now back in stock.
[00:18:17.481 --> 00:18:28.067]  All three of the InfoWars Platinum flagship products that have been sold out for months are now back in stock, but a very limited run because we only had a budget to get
[00:18:29.369 --> 00:18:31.610]  3 or 4,000 bottles of each one of these.
[00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:36.153]  I think we've got 4,000 bottles of the HGH Max Boost that people love so much.
[00:18:37.153 --> 00:18:41.015]  We've got about 4,000 bottles of 1776 Testosterone Boost that just came in.
[00:18:41.035 --> 00:18:43.917]  And we've got about 3,000 bottles of Pain MD.
[00:18:44.437 --> 00:18:47.459]  Incredible natural pain reliever situation.
[00:18:48.599 --> 00:18:54.783]  All three of these are back in stock and they're incredible and they fund our operation at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:19:00.922 --> 00:19:12.728]  We are in the middle of a crude and ugly communist revolution funded by the big banks as a battering ram into a new age digital economy and a total surveillance state.
[00:19:13.188 --> 00:19:21.192]  All branches of government are attacking we the people and they offer us only one option, a meaningless vote in a rigged election.
[00:19:22.072 --> 00:19:32.775]  What we can do is be prepared and you can support the InfoWar by shopping at InfoWarStore.com for products to help you through good times and bad.
[00:19:33.536 --> 00:19:36.336]  And you can share the videos at Band.Video.
[00:19:36.957 --> 00:19:42.258]  Our best hope still is and always has been a mass awakening.
[00:19:42.718 --> 00:19:44.539]  So download the videos and
[00:19:44.779 --> 00:19:48.400]  Share them, upload them, and send them everywhere.
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:54.982]  Let the world unite for truth, justice, and 1776 worldwide.
[00:20:01.064 --> 00:20:06.966]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:22.459 --> 00:20:32.404]  You know, I gotta say this before I plunge into all the earth-shaking news.
[00:20:33.304 --> 00:20:35.666]  It really is surreal to be on air 29 years.
[00:20:36.486 --> 00:20:36.726]  Almost 30.
[00:20:37.947 --> 00:20:40.088]  And how true everything came.
[00:20:41.181 --> 00:20:45.544]  And I gotta just hand it to my grandfathers and my father and my uncle.
[00:20:46.564 --> 00:20:47.985]  Hell, even my dad's brother, too.
[00:20:48.005 --> 00:20:48.765]  He was aware of all this.
[00:20:48.885 --> 00:20:49.766]  He's still alive.
[00:20:49.786 --> 00:20:50.186]  Great guy.
[00:20:50.887 --> 00:20:51.627]  Jolene Jones.
[00:20:52.668 --> 00:20:53.708]  But, man, were they dead on.
[00:20:54.929 --> 00:21:03.994]  If it wasn't for all the patriots in America that were aware of the New World Order decades and decades and decades ago.
[00:21:04.014 --> 00:21:05.895]  I mean, they knew about this stuff in the 50s.
[00:21:06.756 --> 00:21:08.497]  And they've been holding it back and holding it back.
[00:21:08.537 --> 00:21:08.997]  And we've been
[00:21:10.282 --> 00:21:19.965]  Educating people and building infrastructure and just, we've got a real shot at beating these people now because all their gaslighting about how none of this exists isn't working anymore.
[00:21:20.005 --> 00:21:31.529]  But then when I pull back and I see 40 plus percent increase in death worldwide over any other year before.
[00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:36.331]  The worst years before that was like World War I, a 7-8 percent increase.
[00:21:37.851 --> 00:21:39.492]  World War II didn't even kill as many as World War I.
[00:21:41.209 --> 00:21:42.330]  World War I mainly killed military.
[00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:44.853]  World War II killed a bunch of civilians, so it's kind of apples and oranges.
[00:21:44.873 --> 00:21:48.277]  But, I mean, they're really killing 20 million people.
[00:21:48.878 --> 00:21:51.120]  That's a high number.
[00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:52.502]  The low number's at 13 million.
[00:21:52.522 --> 00:21:55.305]  Most come in about 18, 19 million, depending on the actuaries.
[00:21:55.826 --> 00:21:57.668]  But, man, that's just incredible.
[00:21:58.649 --> 00:22:01.733]  And then the 80-plus million the UN admits starved to death because of the lockdowns.
[00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:07.895]  I mean, these people are out to kill us, and I just don't see how humanity goes along with this.
[00:22:08.095 --> 00:22:10.497]  I have real trouble people buying this.
[00:22:11.237 --> 00:22:19.225]  The problem is, as I said last segment, it's so horrible that it's unbelievable, but it's really happening.
[00:22:20.145 --> 00:22:24.990]  But if we'll just get over the fact that we would never even think of such things, but there are people that are
[00:22:25.984 --> 00:22:26.244]  Thank you.
[00:22:47.941 --> 00:22:48.861]  He's admitted to it.
[00:22:48.901 --> 00:22:50.642]  He came here 10 years ago and apologized to me.
[00:22:50.682 --> 00:22:52.763]  He was a guy that bought into the system.
[00:22:52.783 --> 00:22:54.443]  He really thought America hadn't been taken over.
[00:22:55.024 --> 00:22:57.425]  He heard my show and thought that I was a terrible liar.
[00:22:57.445 --> 00:23:01.866]  And then as he saw more and more things come true, he started to wake up 10, 11 years ago.
[00:23:01.886 --> 00:23:04.847]  He was in town, came to visit, came on the show.
[00:23:04.867 --> 00:23:09.089]  We got to know each other, became friends over the years and
[00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:16.591]  I've known Tucker a long time, been to dinner with him a lot, been to events with him, but I've never been to Maine.
[00:23:16.651 --> 00:23:26.153]  I spent three days with him in Maine, where he grew up, and the guy is a super outdoorsman.
[00:23:26.874 --> 00:23:40.897]  I mean, that guy knows how to run a buck, skin a buck, run a trot line, he can plow fields all day long, he can catch catfish from dusk till dawn, he can sharpen his chainsaw so fast it'll make your head spin and is a great shot.
[00:23:42.162 --> 00:23:45.023]  And he's got all this cool property he's bought over the years out there.
[00:23:45.043 --> 00:23:46.604]  It's just, it's like a wonderland.
[00:23:47.344 --> 00:23:49.165]  And he's all like, hell, move up here, man.
[00:23:49.205 --> 00:23:50.726]  Let's get on up here with me.
[00:23:50.746 --> 00:23:56.588]  I mean, he's just, the guy you see on TV, giggling and laughing and having fun.
[00:23:57.429 --> 00:23:59.130]  He's like Santa Claus or something, man.
[00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:01.110]  I've never been around anybody like him.
[00:24:02.031 --> 00:24:04.772]  And we'd be up at seven in the morning and he'd be cooking breakfast.
[00:24:04.832 --> 00:24:06.453]  I was at his house bouncing off the walls.
[00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:16.299]  And then it'd be 11 o'clock at night, and he'd be telling jokes and all this, and I'm just like, how the hell do you have this much energy?
[00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:18.962]  He's like, oh, a guy just shot a bear on my property.
[00:24:19.662 --> 00:24:20.363]  Let's go look at this.
[00:24:20.383 --> 00:24:22.185]  Oh, they just shot a moose on my property.
[00:24:22.205 --> 00:24:22.786]  Let's go over here.
[00:24:23.976 --> 00:24:25.997]  And so he's like, well, I guess it's time to record the interview.
[00:24:26.657 --> 00:24:29.978]  In between running around, let's pull over here and shoot some skeet.
[00:24:30.338 --> 00:24:31.498]  I got this piece of property on the river.
[00:24:32.158 --> 00:24:34.839]  It's just like, wow, this is cool.
[00:24:35.639 --> 00:24:42.061]  And I had all these military guys with me in security, great shots, but he had this skeet machine set super hard.
[00:24:42.881 --> 00:24:51.083]  And it was very interesting and just very impressive.
[00:24:52.003 --> 00:24:55.805]  So with Tucker, it's not some outdoorsman act.
[00:24:56.805 --> 00:25:00.227]  In fact, he doesn't even like guys with guns and shooting videos.
[00:25:00.307 --> 00:25:13.474]  I said, dude, you ought to show people your fly fishing and your grouse and pheasant hunting and your bear hunting and your moose hunting and your mule deer hunting and all of this.
[00:25:13.514 --> 00:25:15.735]  He's like, well, that's just my private life.
[00:25:15.755 --> 00:25:16.215]  That's what I do.
[00:25:16.235 --> 00:25:17.776]  That's what I've been doing since I was a little kid.
[00:25:18.769 --> 00:25:21.670]  Because he would spend the summers there, but lived out in California.
[00:25:23.311 --> 00:25:25.212]  And then his dad would send him back every summer there.
[00:25:25.272 --> 00:25:26.612]  And his dad was a great guy.
[00:25:26.632 --> 00:25:27.233]  He was a great guy.
[00:25:27.253 --> 00:25:32.835]  You know, trained him in doing all sorts of construction, manual labor, and all the rest of it, so he wouldn't be ruined.
[00:25:33.475 --> 00:25:34.996]  But I don't want to gush about Tucker Carlson.
[00:25:35.016 --> 00:25:35.856]  There's so much big news.
[00:25:35.916 --> 00:25:36.937]  It was just a lot of fun.
[00:25:37.217 --> 00:25:43.280]  In fact, go to my wife's Twitter, because I don't have a Twitter, so she put a few photos of Tucker and I. And I've got a bunch of us.
[00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:46.181]  We've got videos of us hunting and shooting shotguns.
[00:25:47.523 --> 00:25:52.425]  All the rest of it, but it was definitely, definitely a lot of fun.
[00:25:53.425 --> 00:25:56.266]  But Tucker was shooting better than the military guys, better than me.
[00:25:57.166 --> 00:25:58.707]  I mean, I was second best shooter.
[00:25:58.727 --> 00:26:00.507]  Nothing against the military guys, they shot a lot of skeet.
[00:26:01.007 --> 00:26:04.608]  But I mean, Tucker had this thing set really fast, going straight out on a line.
[00:26:05.369 --> 00:26:08.790]  And I've never seen a skeet machine set that hard.
[00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:10.550]  He was just blasting them out of the air.
[00:26:11.251 --> 00:26:13.251]  And I'm like, dude, you ought to show people this.
[00:26:13.571 --> 00:26:15.172]  This is what you ought to be showing people.
[00:26:16.048 --> 00:26:20.089]  He's like, yeah, I built that cabin over there, and I'm clearing all this right now.
[00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:24.391]  I mean, I know all that stuff.
[00:26:24.431 --> 00:26:25.231]  I've done that stuff.
[00:26:25.271 --> 00:26:30.012]  I'm not like a woodsman or a mountain man or anything, but I've definitely done it all.
[00:26:31.033 --> 00:26:33.513]  I mean, I've dehorned a thousand cattle in a day.
[00:26:33.613 --> 00:26:38.795]  I've done cesarean sections on horses and cows.
[00:26:38.895 --> 00:26:44.377]  I've roofed houses and strung electrical wire and beat people's brains in.
[00:26:45.613 --> 00:26:48.974]  But let me tell you, Tucker Carlson is a manly man.
[00:26:49.174 --> 00:26:50.455]  He didn't put that oar off.
[00:26:50.495 --> 00:26:51.735]  He's this happy, jolly elf.
[00:26:51.795 --> 00:26:54.996]  But the best way to describe Tucker Carlson is Santa Claus.
[00:26:55.796 --> 00:26:57.357]  He's a young Santa Claus.
[00:26:57.397 --> 00:26:58.457]  He's 50-something years old.
[00:26:59.017 --> 00:27:00.698]  But I'm going to stop gushing about Tucker Carlson.
[00:27:00.718 --> 00:27:04.459]  I'm going to get into Elon Musk coming up, coming out.
[00:27:04.479 --> 00:27:05.859]  A whole bunch of tweets here.
[00:27:05.899 --> 00:27:07.800]  They're saying he's looking to unman Alex Jones.
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:08.880]  And it's bigger than me.
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:11.081]  What does that signify with Elon doing that?
[00:27:11.801 --> 00:27:13.041]  The huge Tucker interview.
[00:27:13.101 --> 00:27:14.682]  The whole globalist plan put out there.
[00:27:15.502 --> 00:27:17.583]  It's going to get 100 million views by the time it's done.
[00:27:17.904 --> 00:27:21.046]  The clips have already gotten 50 million views or more on Twitter.
[00:27:22.066 --> 00:27:24.648]  And that's a record of what they're going to do.
[00:27:25.288 --> 00:27:29.791]  And so as they roll their plan out, that interview is devastating.
[00:27:30.552 --> 00:27:31.452]  It's already damaged them.
[00:27:32.133 --> 00:27:36.976]  But it's going to really upset their apple cart in a big, big way.
[00:27:38.497 --> 00:27:39.998]  So very, very exciting.
[00:27:40.018 --> 00:27:41.339]  Mark Dice tweeted out this WWE
[00:27:44.717 --> 00:27:45.598]  I love Vince McMahon.
[00:27:46.358 --> 00:27:49.039]  Tucker on X after getting fired from Fox News.
[00:27:49.059 --> 00:27:49.840]  McMahon's smiling.
[00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:52.841]  Tucker interviewing Alex Jones on X. Oh, now he's really happy.
[00:27:53.541 --> 00:27:55.602]  Elon Singh is considering restoring Alex Jones' account.
[00:27:55.882 --> 00:27:56.523]  Woo!
[00:27:58.704 --> 00:28:00.164]  This is the real world, folks.
[00:28:00.224 --> 00:28:01.405]  This is the real info war.
[00:28:01.925 --> 00:28:03.086]  And it gets better today.
[00:28:03.146 --> 00:28:04.706]  Let's punch him up real quick before we go to break.
[00:28:05.947 --> 00:28:07.368]  Look at that Moses beard.
[00:28:07.388 --> 00:28:09.769]  That's Hillbilly right there, boy.
[00:28:10.911 --> 00:28:12.251]  Solitary confinement.
[00:28:12.271 --> 00:28:14.432]  They were keeping him there the whole time until the pressure.
[00:28:15.913 --> 00:28:17.433]  They released him 15 days early.
[00:28:18.073 --> 00:28:21.335]  Owen is on the highway, leaving Louisiana for Texas.
[00:28:21.375 --> 00:28:22.295]  He'll be back next week.
[00:28:23.015 --> 00:28:25.636]  And he's going to be on Tucker either Tuesday or Wednesday.
[00:28:26.136 --> 00:28:29.697]  If his probation officer lets him get on an airplane, maybe he'll do it remote.
[00:28:30.058 --> 00:28:31.178]  Maybe they'll let him do it remote.
[00:28:31.598 --> 00:28:34.959]  You know, the judge said in his sentencing document he's going to jail for his speech.
[00:28:34.999 --> 00:28:38.300]  Maybe Owen will get more prison time for what he's about to say straight ahead.
[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:39.661]  So, Owen Schreier
[00:28:40.501 --> 00:28:44.083]  When I say this, I mean it from the very bottom of my heart.
[00:29:03.843 --> 00:29:07.968]  I want to say thank you to all the viewers and listeners for supporting the broadcast over the years.
[00:29:08.448 --> 00:29:11.752]  We together have changed the world at an incredible level.
[00:29:11.772 --> 00:29:14.936]  And I want to salute the crew as well and all of our sponsors and supporters.
[00:29:15.376 --> 00:29:19.381]  Ladies and gentlemen, wow, the fight has really been joined with a globalist.
[00:29:20.408 --> 00:29:27.914]  And as we go into 2024, the most important election in world history, it is now more important than ever to get around the censors and override the globalists.
[00:29:27.954 --> 00:29:29.616]  So keep spreading the word about the broadcast.
[00:29:30.056 --> 00:29:31.217]  Keep sharing the articles and videos.
[00:29:31.617 --> 00:29:34.500]  Keep praying for the broadcast and our reporters and the crew.

[00:29:37.262 --> 00:29:38.083]  We're for Christmas.

[00:29:54.119 --> 00:29:55.781]  My new book, The Great Awakening.

[00:29:59.024 --> 00:29:59.345]  Thank you.
[00:29:59.705 --> 00:30:04.547]  Please listen closely because this is life-changing critical information.
[00:30:05.167 --> 00:30:14.991]  The globalists are bombarding us with toxic chemicals hitting us in the air, the water, the food, the 5G, the poison shots, the shedding.
[00:30:15.991 --> 00:30:16.532]  I'm good.
[00:30:39.595 --> 00:30:39.975]  I think so.
[00:31:00.084 --> 00:31:05.550]  If you ever take one piece of my advice, it's get a bottle of X2.
[00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:10.595]  It's been sold out for over a year because we wouldn't cut corners and because they're so hard to produce.
[00:31:10.975 --> 00:31:15.359]  We finally have a limited run, back in supply, at infowarestore.com.
[00:31:16.790 --> 00:31:19.553]  So many people have serious issues.
[00:31:19.854 --> 00:31:20.975]  Look at the UN's own numbers.
[00:31:21.415 --> 00:31:26.821]  Billions have cognitive disabilities because they do not have true nascent iodine in their bodies.
[00:31:27.362 --> 00:31:32.788]  Most other iodine is bound to other heavy metals or bound to other elements so you don't download it.
[00:31:33.408 --> 00:31:36.171]  But this is pure atomic certified
[00:31:38.047 --> 00:31:39.268]  I don't know.
[00:31:59.801 --> 00:32:03.545]  Why do you think the globalists are desperately trying to censor everybody?
[00:32:03.865 --> 00:32:07.028]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk and everybody else?
[00:32:07.428 --> 00:32:11.892]  Because they can't get through this giant, megalomaniacal power grab if we're here exposing them.
[00:32:12.533 --> 00:32:14.655]  But we're not just exposing their operation.
[00:32:14.975 --> 00:32:22.963]  In my new book, we give you the solutions to build a new, better world, an alternative to Klaus Schwab's, you will eat the bugs.
[00:32:23.583 --> 00:32:24.905]  This is the Great Awakening.
[00:32:25.405 --> 00:32:29.310]  The plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[00:32:29.770 --> 00:32:33.314]  It's a companion to my last book that was a number one worldwide bestseller.
[00:32:33.574 --> 00:32:36.097]  And this book is even thicker and even more powerful.
[00:32:36.438 --> 00:32:40.282]  Get your copy of The Great Awakening today at InfoWarstore.com.
[00:32:40.282 --> 00:32:43.305]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[00:33:12.641 --> 00:33:16.643]  Because you can't starve us out and you can't make us run.
[00:33:16.843 --> 00:33:20.104]  Cause when them old boys raise their own shotguns.
[00:33:21.785 --> 00:33:24.546]  We say praise, we say ma'am.
[00:33:24.626 --> 00:33:27.948]  If you ain't into that, we don't give a damn.
[00:33:31.009 --> 00:33:37.572]  We came from the West Virginia coal mines and the Rocky Mountains and the western skies.
[00:33:42.307 --> 00:33:47.690]  And we can skin a buck, we can run a trot line, and a country boy can survive.
[00:33:48.850 --> 00:33:56.874]  Country folks can survive!
[00:33:56.894 --> 00:33:59.675]  I had a good friend in New York City.
[00:33:59.895 --> 00:34:02.797]  He never called me by my name, just Hillbilly.
[00:34:08.031 --> 00:34:11.198]  Better learn how to live off the land, folks.
[00:34:11.218 --> 00:34:13.223]  They're shutting off everything.
[00:34:21.189 --> 00:34:21.709]  We can do it.
[00:34:21.729 --> 00:34:23.070]  We can come together now.
[00:34:23.451 --> 00:34:25.392]  We're gonna beat these people.
[00:34:25.452 --> 00:34:26.012]  We're strong.
[00:34:26.393 --> 00:34:26.793]  They're weak.
[00:34:27.213 --> 00:34:27.834]  We've been asleep.
[00:34:28.394 --> 00:34:28.994]  Now we're awake.
[00:34:29.875 --> 00:34:32.337]  I'd like to spit some peach nut in that dude's eye.
[00:34:40.913 --> 00:34:42.674]  Cause you can't make us run!
[00:34:42.754 --> 00:34:43.854]  You can't starve us out!
[00:34:43.974 --> 00:34:44.374]  Woo!
[00:35:00.276 --> 00:35:04.439]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schroyer.
[00:35:26.291 --> 00:35:32.856]  The great patriot, the great talk show host and journalist has now been sent to prison as a message to the world.
[00:35:32.896 --> 00:35:36.319]  The judge said, because you still say the election was stolen!
[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:39.442]  And he was thrown in solitary confinement.
[00:35:39.482 --> 00:35:40.863]  I talked to him this morning right when he got out.
[00:35:40.923 --> 00:35:47.428]  It was the pressure you put, you, that ended up them letting him go early and getting him out of solitary confinement.
[00:35:47.988 --> 00:35:49.430]  And he's going to be back Monday.
[00:35:49.450 --> 00:35:50.751]  I told him to take a few days off.
[00:35:52.050 --> 00:35:54.433]  He was ready to come back on tomorrow, so take a few days.
[00:35:54.473 --> 00:35:56.475]  He's going to be on with Tucker next week.
[00:35:56.495 --> 00:35:57.296]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[00:35:57.716 --> 00:35:58.477]  Very exciting.
[00:35:58.497 --> 00:36:02.661]  Appreciative of Tucker putting attention on this, because it's all of our free speeches that are going to happen.
[00:36:02.681 --> 00:36:05.063]  Owen's on the side of the road talking to us.
[00:36:05.224 --> 00:36:07.486]  Owen, my friend, this is going to be a quick boil down.
[00:36:07.506 --> 00:36:10.168]  We're going to talk more about it on Monday on your show, 3 p.m.
[00:36:10.509 --> 00:36:11.870]  Central, The War Room, and then with Tucker.
[00:36:12.531 --> 00:36:14.493]  But, Owen, good to see your face, my friend.
[00:36:16.155 --> 00:36:17.556]  Well, it's great to hear your voice.
[00:36:17.636 --> 00:36:19.257]  It's great to hear from the crew again.
[00:36:19.677 --> 00:36:33.625]  And you know, so many times, Alex, over the years, I feel like we are telepathically communicating and synced up with one another, because as soon as Hank Williams hit coming out of that break, I was like, man, Hank Williams never sounded so good in my life.
[00:36:33.725 --> 00:36:34.705]  I hope he lets it play.
[00:36:35.126 --> 00:36:36.827]  And you let it play for about 60 seconds.
[00:36:36.907 --> 00:36:39.768]  And damn, Hank Williams never sounded so good.
[00:36:40.169 --> 00:36:40.829]  You know, um,
[00:36:42.245 --> 00:36:48.168]  It was an experience that I think God wanted me to go through these last 48 days in jail.
[00:36:48.648 --> 00:36:49.348]  There's no doubt.
[00:36:49.909 --> 00:36:55.491]  And while it was not something that was pleasant, I certainly went through the worst of it.
[00:36:55.931 --> 00:36:56.932]  I went through lows.
[00:36:57.660 --> 00:37:11.427]  I got through the worst of it, but there's a lot of things I learned in there, not just that need to be known to the world about how the BOP works, how the justice system is the injustice system, and so many other things.
[00:37:11.967 --> 00:37:13.428]  I was also able to read.
[00:37:13.448 --> 00:37:18.130]  I read 15 books while I was in there, so I learned a lot.
[00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:19.271]  I sharpened my mind.
[00:37:19.671 --> 00:37:21.512]  But you know, you mentioned this coming in, Alex.
[00:37:21.532 --> 00:37:25.814]  There's no doubt that not just the political pressure
[00:37:26.474 --> 00:37:36.078]  That was applied from the outside in regards to my case that helped me get out of solitary confinement, or it's called the SHU.
[00:37:36.178 --> 00:37:38.879]  For people that have been in federal prison before, you know what the SHU is.
[00:37:38.899 --> 00:37:40.320]  I was in the SHU.
[00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:46.943]  I spent the majority of my time actually in confinement, in lockdown, treated like a high security prisoner.
[00:37:47.503 --> 00:37:50.144]  But there's no doubt that the power of prayer
[00:37:51.477 --> 00:38:17.072]  As it said in the Bible, I read the entire Bible cover to cover and there was one passage from the Bible that really stuck with me as I was reading it and it was when Paul and Silas were in prison and they talked about the power of prayer and of course Paul and the Apostles were wrongfully imprisoned many times as well and they talked about the power of prayer and how at one time when Paul and Silas were in prison
[00:38:17.879 --> 00:38:29.151]  It was their prayers every day to God that rocked the foundations of the earth and caused an earthquake which led to the prison doors being opened for them in which case they walked out.
[00:38:29.711 --> 00:38:32.834]  And I do believe this happened for me not once but twice.
[00:38:33.535 --> 00:38:35.377]  First it was the power of prayer and
[00:38:36.969 --> 00:38:56.925]  The prayers coming from this audience and God hearing your prayers that first opened up the doors of the special housing unit known as the SHU or solitary confinement, the prison in the prison, and then again opened up the prison door so that I could be released early serving 47 days of my 60 day sentence.
[00:38:56.965 --> 00:39:03.310]  So, you know, and I'll just say this, and I cannot, I cannot state this strongly enough.
[00:39:04.582 --> 00:39:13.719]  My faith in God has been solidified and my faith in the American people has been reaffirmed.
[00:39:14.495 --> 00:39:24.905]  And I'll have a lot of things to say about that in the coming days and weeks and months as we gird ourselves for this, what is going to be an epic 2024 year presidential election.
[00:39:25.405 --> 00:39:36.696]  But I think the spirit of humanity, I think the soul, our consciousness is starting to get reattuned with our divine creation and the future that we
[00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:40.341]  Have our manifest destiny set to?
[00:39:40.922 --> 00:39:44.143]  We are not destined to be slaves in a global corporate government.
[00:39:44.543 --> 00:39:52.808]  We are not destined to be destitute and desolate and desperate on this creation, this earth that God gave to us.
[00:39:53.348 --> 00:39:56.170]  No, our destiny is something much brighter.
[00:39:56.710 --> 00:40:01.993]  Our destiny is something much more prosperous and expansive.
[00:40:02.673 --> 00:40:04.634]  And I think we're in a turning now, Alex.
[00:40:04.894 --> 00:40:07.516]  I really, I really do believe that.
[00:40:09.136 --> 00:40:23.462]  Oh, and when you got that one phone call out, you reported the same thing that we heard from Joe Biggs and everybody until they totally silenced him, that you were overwhelmingly supported by the inmates and that they knew that you were a political prisoner and they really support President Trump.
[00:40:23.522 --> 00:40:28.805]  And so they see many of them that have been set up while they release really hardened criminals.
[00:40:29.745 --> 00:40:35.509]  They really resonated with you, so it shows from the highest levels to the lowest levels, people really know what's going on.
[00:40:35.529 --> 00:40:44.835]  I hope when you go on Tucker next week, because it will reach tens of millions of people, that you don't just talk about your experience, Owen, but this is a larger persecution going on.
[00:40:44.855 --> 00:40:56.583]  They're trying to put Trump in prison, they're trying to put everybody else in prison, they're trying to put me in prison, and people need to understand that the judge said, and I want you to send that to Tucker, I got you on the phone with the producer today, because they called me and wanted you on.
[00:40:58.328 --> 00:41:04.861]  To show people the sentencing document where the judge says, well I have three examples the FBI gave me.
[00:41:06.024 --> 00:41:09.827]  Or the Justice Department, where Owen in the last few months said the election was stolen.
[00:41:10.387 --> 00:41:19.594]  So because he's not remorseful, you're at the Capitol trying to stop people going in, but because you believe it was stolen, which is overwhelming, and the majority of Americans believe in major polls, they're sending you to jail.
[00:41:19.654 --> 00:41:24.878]  They want you to know we're criminals, we're going to put you in prison for your speech.
[00:41:24.958 --> 00:41:27.520]  I mean, they have indicted themselves.
[00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:33.064]  They are tyrants naked, wanting us to know they are, seeking that will then intimidate us, Owen.
[00:41:33.104 --> 00:41:35.366]  And that's really the gauntlet they've thrown down here.
[00:41:36.974 --> 00:41:43.618]  Well, and of course, in the sentencing memo, and part of my sentencing was, well, if not the majority, was my speech.
[00:41:44.298 --> 00:41:54.444]  And one of the speeches cited was me saying, death to tyrants, which, by the way, is the logo on the Virginia state flag, so what are they gonna ban that next to?
[00:41:54.804 --> 00:41:56.885]  But, I mean, it's a pretty simple question and answer.
[00:41:57.346 --> 00:42:00.187]  Who would be offended by saying, death to tyrants?
[00:42:00.507 --> 00:42:01.108]  Well, tyrants!
[00:42:01.588 --> 00:42:02.668]  Would be offended by that.
[00:42:02.969 --> 00:42:12.632]  Now, I would suggest, if people want to get the background, if you're just hearing about this for the first time, go look at the press conferences my attorney and I, Norm Pattis, have done.
[00:42:13.032 --> 00:42:14.273]  We did another sit-down.
[00:42:14.313 --> 00:42:15.613]  We did an interview with you, Alex.
[00:42:15.633 --> 00:42:16.754]  We did another long-form
[00:42:17.294 --> 00:42:17.895]  We're good to go.
[00:42:40.942 --> 00:42:44.224]  When people read this sentencing memo, it's exactly what you said.
[00:42:44.244 --> 00:42:46.326]  This is a speech crime.
[00:42:46.686 --> 00:42:52.230]  We are now living in an age in America where speech crimes and thought crimes are being punishable.
[00:42:53.672 --> 00:42:57.373]  They don't just want to say, oh, we're going to throw you in jail for your speech.
[00:42:57.714 --> 00:43:05.897]  They want to be able to make you change your speech in a 1984 Orwellian news speak manner to say, no, no, no, no.
[00:43:06.297 --> 00:43:11.919]  Not only are you going to go to jail, we're going to force you to apologize and retract your statements, which, by the way,
[00:43:12.623 --> 00:43:20.391]  Sad to say, a lot of Trump's attorneys and a lot of Trump's team did just that, in case you didn't notice in the last month.
[00:43:20.952 --> 00:43:25.016]  Well, that's because they all know they're going to be disbarred or put in prison.
[00:43:25.677 --> 00:43:26.838]  They did that to all my lawyers.
[00:43:27.599 --> 00:43:28.479]  That's how they control it.
[00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:31.242]  My point is, Owen, and I know you know this, but
[00:43:32.043 --> 00:43:33.564]  People know you've been persecuted for your speech.
[00:43:33.604 --> 00:43:38.547]  Now they want to hear your speech about your views on the world, about the globalists, about the New World Order.
[00:43:38.968 --> 00:43:44.511]  So I'm just telling you what I'll tell you privately right now, recounting solitary confinement, them being mean to you.
[00:43:44.551 --> 00:43:45.352]  I talked about this morning.
[00:43:45.572 --> 00:43:46.453]  That's all important.
[00:43:46.493 --> 00:43:47.413]  It's a microcosm.
[00:43:47.453 --> 00:43:50.295]  But the big issue is, what was it Owen was doing?
[00:43:50.636 --> 00:43:51.696]  They don't want to be heard.
[00:43:52.116 --> 00:43:55.379]  And so I would make it about that, because you're going to have a really bigger voice now.
[00:43:56.119 --> 00:43:57.641]  And again, the enemy didn't think about that.
[00:43:57.701 --> 00:44:10.293]  Now, you were already popular in a lot of interviews, your show was popular, but now, we have people lining up to interview you, and I just hope that it's, you know, 10% about what happened in prison, how you were persecuted, and 90%, this is what they didn't want me to say.
[00:44:10.313 --> 00:44:11.014]  Because Trump...
[00:44:12.179 --> 00:44:16.785]  Made one big mistake, and this isn't for Owen, this is for me to know this, it's for the audience, because I do this too.
[00:44:17.245 --> 00:44:22.032]  They sue us, they attack us, it's leaked, memos have come out, to get us off balance.
[00:44:22.092 --> 00:44:29.141]  So, they kept accusing Trump of being a Russian agent, so he would spend all his time defending that, saying I'm not a Russian agent, instead of being on offense.
[00:44:29.161 --> 00:44:29.902]  Does that make sense, Owen?
[00:44:31.954 --> 00:44:32.394]  Of course.
[00:44:32.675 --> 00:44:40.400]  And of course, not only did I get sent to prison for my speech, I then got sent to the prison in the prison for my speech.
[00:44:40.841 --> 00:44:43.303]  So these people really don't want us talking, Alex.
[00:44:43.363 --> 00:44:47.045]  It's the same reason why they censored you off the internet, censored me off the internet.
[00:44:47.326 --> 00:44:49.407]  You're still fighting to get reinstated on Twitter.
[00:44:49.447 --> 00:44:50.928]  Maybe Elon Musk will let you back.
[00:44:50.988 --> 00:44:54.471]  Maybe he'll let me back on there as well with my original account.
[00:44:54.931 --> 00:44:56.873]  But I want to expand on something else you said.
[00:44:58.323 --> 00:45:08.908]  Not just the inmates that all were very supportive of me and my cause, and they feel like now, you know, many of them who are wrongfully incarcerated as well may have a voice on the outside.
[00:45:10.689 --> 00:45:12.670]  Folks, a lot of the people that worked in there
[00:45:13.630 --> 00:45:16.911]  I mean, I don't know how else to say it, but they're fans of us as well.
[00:45:16.991 --> 00:45:18.612]  They're like-minded people as well.
[00:45:19.052 --> 00:45:27.375]  Many of the people that work there didn't know who I was, but there's obviously a bunch of hubba-baloo about me going in there, all the letters, all the political pressure.
[00:45:27.415 --> 00:45:31.037]  They went and looked me up, and then a lot of them were like, hey, I just looked you up, and your stuff is good.
[00:45:31.117 --> 00:45:33.037]  So, it's just like everywhere else.
[00:45:33.077 --> 00:45:36.038]  You've got people that hate our message, and you've got people that love our message.
[00:45:36.619 --> 00:45:37.439]  But the point is,
[00:45:38.709 --> 00:45:39.569]  People are curious.
[00:45:39.730 --> 00:45:41.630]  What is it that they don't want us to hear?
[00:45:42.051 --> 00:45:44.312]  Oh, they don't want you to question the 2020 election?
[00:45:44.332 --> 00:45:45.092]  Well, that's odd.
[00:45:45.132 --> 00:45:46.613]  Maybe I should look more into that.
[00:45:46.973 --> 00:45:53.116]  Oh, they don't want you to question the nature of the COVID vaccines, the mRNA injections that they forced you to take?
[00:45:53.496 --> 00:45:54.777]  Oh, maybe I should look into that.
[00:45:55.658 --> 00:46:04.346]  And it just so happened I was able to see some of the clips from the Republican primary debate, and what are Vivek Ramaswamy and Rhonda Santos talking about?
[00:46:04.747 --> 00:46:08.530]  How bad the vaccines were, how people got harmed by them, how the mandates were bad.
[00:46:08.810 --> 00:46:10.252]  We would have never heard that before!
[00:46:10.828 --> 00:46:16.030]  We would have never heard that on such a national and important political stage as we hear now.
[00:46:16.330 --> 00:46:22.112]  That's us hitting the ground, that's us breaking that window, breaking that door down so that other people can talk about it.
[00:46:22.132 --> 00:46:23.433]  And what you're saying is so key.
[00:46:23.493 --> 00:46:26.574]  And it's not like the audience is at the bottom, they're at the top.
[00:46:26.874 --> 00:46:29.275]  The audience supports, gives us intel, spreads the word.
[00:46:29.975 --> 00:46:37.821]  Supports us and then with the guests and all of what we do we're able to get this out and you can see the enemy admits to us and CIA memos that have come out to this department.
[00:46:38.342 --> 00:46:49.551]  Infowars nine times out of ten is the progenitor of people then looking into things like two weeks ago we're talking about new memos that came out with the CIA and Defense Department censoring America's being behind it.
[00:46:49.651 --> 00:46:51.012]  Now that's mainstream news on Fox.
[00:46:51.052 --> 00:46:53.013]  So that's why we're important.
[00:46:53.334 --> 00:46:54.435]  We're the incubator.
[00:46:54.495 --> 00:46:56.116]  That's what God put us in charge of.
[00:46:56.476 --> 00:46:56.836]  That's our
[00:46:57.597 --> 00:46:59.858]  Well, it is the Streisand effect, there's no doubt, because
[00:47:24.617 --> 00:47:33.142]  As far as we can tell, and my attorneys and I are still looking into this, I think I'm the only person ever to be in a federal prison with a misdemeanor.
[00:47:33.422 --> 00:47:33.603]  Ever.
[00:47:33.963 --> 00:47:37.145]  Nobody has ever heard of somebody with a misdemeanor in a federal prison.
[00:47:37.465 --> 00:47:42.048]  None of the inmates that did long time, none of the guards, none of the... Nobody's ever heard of that.
[00:47:42.088 --> 00:47:43.488]  So what happens is people say, huh?
[00:47:43.889 --> 00:47:45.650]  Why are they putting this guy in prison?
[00:47:45.690 --> 00:47:47.111]  I want to look into what he's saying.
[00:47:47.411 --> 00:47:49.052]  So there's no doubt that is going on.
[00:47:49.913 --> 00:47:54.077]  When they put me in solitary for the phone call, nobody had ever heard of that before.
[00:47:54.297 --> 00:47:58.141]  So they said, hmm, why are they putting this guy in solitary for his speech?
[00:47:58.202 --> 00:47:59.683]  I want to go find out what he's talking about.
[00:48:00.043 --> 00:48:01.986]  So there's no doubt the Streisand effect is taking place.
[00:48:02.386 --> 00:48:05.549]  As far as what I'm going to do in the future, Alex, I want to do what I've continued to do.
[00:48:05.569 --> 00:48:07.892]  I want to continue to expose the corruption in our government.
[00:48:08.212 --> 00:48:12.595]  I want to continue to expose the corruption in our media, our mainstream media.
[00:48:12.615 --> 00:48:18.678]  I want to continue to expose the propaganda that exists everywhere in Hollywood, mainstream media, news media.
[00:48:18.918 --> 00:48:24.781]  I want to expose the corporate world government enslavement program that they have us all going into towards the mark of the beast.
[00:48:25.202 --> 00:48:32.926]  But I will say this, there's an issue that I'm definitely going to be taking up now and as far as the capacity or the
[00:48:33.746 --> 00:48:54.168]  The level of it I'm not quite sure yet but prison reform is a major issue that we need to address immediately in this country and I know that my name got brought up during the BOP hearing when they're requesting two billion more dollars and it didn't go so well for them because the whole thing is incompetence, ineptitude, and I would say
[00:48:55.169 --> 00:48:58.832]  At least half the people that are in the prisons right now probably don't even belong there.
[00:48:59.032 --> 00:49:00.053]  You mentioned this earlier.
[00:49:00.413 --> 00:49:08.379]  You go into major inner cities, Democrat cities, Soros DAs, they release the most violent criminals in the country back out onto the streets.
[00:49:08.679 --> 00:49:15.665]  But they have all kinds of political prisoners rotting in jail cells every day that most people don't know about.
[00:49:16.145 --> 00:49:25.532]  And now I'm going to be able to have their voices be heard, and a lot of people inside are really encouraged by this, because nobody's gotten this much attention that's been put away like they have.
[00:49:25.732 --> 00:49:34.979]  Absolutely, because what they're doing is they're releasing violent people, but not the non-violence, so then it discredits prison reform, and then they defund the police at the same time, and they make us want more prisons.
[00:49:35.379 --> 00:49:36.840]  This is all ugly and dialectic.
[00:49:36.860 --> 00:49:38.462]  The people running this are very sophisticated.
[00:49:38.482 --> 00:49:41.224]  Now, you're going to do the deep dive with Tucker Carlson on Tuesday.
[00:49:41.744 --> 00:49:47.488]  You're going to be back on Monday hosting your own show, but we're happy to give Tucker the big exclusive where you go through all this.
[00:49:47.588 --> 00:49:50.209]  I'm not sure we're going to call in to the War Room at 3 p.m.
[00:49:50.229 --> 00:49:54.552]  today with Chase Geyser hosting it, but I know you hadn't had a haircut.
[00:49:54.572 --> 00:49:55.352]  I talked to you this morning.
[00:49:55.372 --> 00:49:58.534]  You said you're exhausted, but I have just a few little tidbits I wanted to add.
[00:49:58.854 --> 00:50:02.657]  Just to be clear, they didn't just put you 23 hours in solitary confinement today.
[00:50:03.577 --> 00:50:10.782]  When your letter got out and your lawyer couldn't talk to you or anything, you said that three days a week they'd let you out for a 15-minute shower.
[00:50:11.761 --> 00:50:18.424]  And that happened to me once in juvenile, but I wasn't in there long, but I got one shower a week.
[00:50:18.464 --> 00:50:22.766]  And let me tell you, when you're in a room for six, seven days, you get out for 20 minutes.
[00:50:23.942 --> 00:50:26.923]  And then the jail guard watches you and says you got a pretty ass.
[00:50:26.963 --> 00:50:27.783]  That actually happened to me.
[00:50:27.803 --> 00:50:29.864]  And it wasn't my fault.
[00:50:29.944 --> 00:50:30.804]  Charges got dropped.
[00:50:31.024 --> 00:50:34.906]  I put a guy on a coma so they put me in the dangerous area because I'm a dangerous guy.
[00:50:34.926 --> 00:50:36.926]  There's a big guy that did that too.
[00:50:36.947 --> 00:50:37.367]  He attacked me.
[00:50:37.387 --> 00:50:38.147]  I was fighting for my life.
[00:50:38.167 --> 00:50:39.507]  So I beat his brains out basically.
[00:50:39.547 --> 00:50:43.909]  But the point is that... Describe what that was like.
[00:50:46.192 --> 00:50:55.837]  Well, I reached a low point about halfway through my solitary, and I won't get too much into the details, but there was a moment where I really hit my low point.
[00:50:56.517 --> 00:51:05.102]  And I wouldn't say I was near a breaking point, because I always remain steadfast, but there was definitely a low point that I will never forget being in there.
[00:51:07.461 --> 00:51:12.006]  It's hard when you never see the sun, when you aren't allowed any movement.
[00:51:12.046 --> 00:51:14.329]  The only movement I got was 15 minutes to shower.
[00:51:14.369 --> 00:51:15.890]  They cuff you every time you move.
[00:51:16.311 --> 00:51:18.954]  You get three meals of prison slop every day.
[00:51:19.535 --> 00:51:20.576]  You're always hungry.
[00:51:20.656 --> 00:51:23.919]  You're never sleeping because the lights are always on.
[00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:25.441]  It's always noisy.
[00:51:25.461 --> 00:51:27.463]  There was a low point, but
[00:51:29.784 --> 00:51:31.526]  Like I said, I always remained steadfast.
[00:51:31.706 --> 00:51:34.248]  I always kept my faith and my strength in God.
[00:51:34.288 --> 00:51:35.089]  I was always praying.
[00:51:35.129 --> 00:51:36.330]  I know people were praying for me.
[00:51:36.350 --> 00:51:40.213]  And after that valley of the low point, things started to turn around.
[00:51:41.734 --> 00:51:43.716]  Like I said, the foundations were shook.
[00:51:44.116 --> 00:51:45.417]  The prison doors were opened.
[00:51:45.477 --> 00:51:51.022]  And you told me this morning that you learned the pressure of the listeners and people is the reason that they let you go early.
[00:51:51.042 --> 00:51:52.263]  They were like, okay, get rid of the problem.
[00:51:53.979 --> 00:51:56.101]  100% without a doubt.
[00:51:56.281 --> 00:51:58.502]  I would have been in solitary.
[00:51:58.602 --> 00:51:59.823]  I would have been in confinement.
[00:51:59.963 --> 00:52:09.168]  The entire sentence probably would have served over 50 days, all in confinement, if it wasn't for the political pressure and the prayers on the outside.
[00:52:09.188 --> 00:52:09.908]  110% no doubt about it.
[00:52:13.530 --> 00:52:14.411]  All right, Owen.
[00:52:14.451 --> 00:52:16.933]  Well, again, nobody with a misdemeanor is ever put in prison.
[00:52:17.394 --> 00:52:18.735]  People say, oh, he only got two months.
[00:52:18.755 --> 00:52:19.356]  What's the big deal?
[00:52:19.376 --> 00:52:19.756]  Grow up.
[00:52:19.976 --> 00:52:20.377]  Suck it up.
[00:52:20.977 --> 00:52:21.758]  It's the press.
[00:52:21.818 --> 00:52:25.081]  He was there at the Capitol with me, and they said the charging document.
[00:52:25.261 --> 00:52:26.162]  Owen has lied.
[00:52:26.562 --> 00:52:27.423]  He perjured himself.
[00:52:27.463 --> 00:52:28.844]  He doesn't work at Infowars.
[00:52:29.185 --> 00:52:30.106]  He's never worked there.
[00:52:30.706 --> 00:52:34.552]  I'm reading this in a federal document, the level of their deception.
[00:52:35.032 --> 00:52:37.316]  These criminals just think they've got free reign.
[00:52:37.596 --> 00:52:43.364]  Now Biden says we're going to send troops in to Ukraine if we don't give him another $106 billion to launder.
[00:52:43.705 --> 00:52:45.027]  I mean, these people are maniacs.
[00:52:46.676 --> 00:52:58.166]  It's Twilight Zone stuff when you deal this, and I don't know if the transcripts ever got released from my sentencing, but the prosecuting attorneys, they get up there because our argument is, hey, this is free speech, this is First Amendment.
[00:52:58.567 --> 00:52:59.908]  And the attorneys for the U.S.
[00:52:59.928 --> 00:53:04.712]  government get up there and they say, this is not about Owen Schroer's speech, but here's what he said.
[00:53:05.012 --> 00:53:08.235]  This is not about Owen Schroer's First Amendment, but here's what he was reporting.
[00:53:08.275 --> 00:53:09.316]  Here's what he did on a video.
[00:53:09.336 --> 00:53:09.757]  So it's like,
[00:53:10.117 --> 00:53:14.700]  Twilight Zone stuff, you almost can't even believe that this is real world stuff.
[00:53:14.740 --> 00:53:22.325]  You think you're in like a movie or some sort of a simulation and these are like non-player characters that are just repeating whatever they're programming.
[00:53:22.345 --> 00:53:25.387]  That's how I felt in federal court, federal bankruptcy court two weeks ago.
[00:53:26.408 --> 00:53:30.711]  The other lawyers, like eight of them, nine of them, they were just, they looked like robot NPCs.
[00:53:30.731 --> 00:53:32.272]  They were just, everything they said was a lie.
[00:53:32.292 --> 00:53:35.754]  And I was like, thank God, these people don't even look real.
[00:53:36.335 --> 00:53:38.136]  It was like, what the hell's going on here?
[00:53:40.051 --> 00:53:52.157]  Well, Alex, I know we're running short on time here, and I kind of want to turn this around and boomerang this on you for a second, because, like I said earlier, I think that we're really at a turning point now.
[00:53:52.297 --> 00:53:55.458]  I'm not guaranteeing victory or anything, and this is all in God's hands.
[00:53:55.478 --> 00:53:56.419]  No, I totally agree.
[00:53:56.519 --> 00:53:58.540]  Everybody agrees that the turning is happening.
[00:53:59.707 --> 00:54:01.390]  But your life's work, Alex.
[00:54:01.951 --> 00:54:03.213]  20 plus years of doing this.
[00:54:03.433 --> 00:54:04.875]  I've seen you go through highs.
[00:54:04.915 --> 00:54:05.977]  I've seen you go through lows.
[00:54:06.017 --> 00:54:11.506]  I've seen them try to destroy you and still you're here on air today giving me this platform for my first statements.
[00:54:12.136 --> 00:54:14.037]  I mean, how do you feel seeing this?
[00:54:14.078 --> 00:54:19.742]  Do you feel like your life's work is starting to finally be manifest and the fruits are starting to grow?
[00:54:20.983 --> 00:54:26.427]  I definitely see it and I know it, but it really means we're just waking up now to the fight we were already in.
[00:54:26.447 --> 00:54:32.051]  We're getting beat up in our bed, we're waking up and are finally starting to throw our first punches, and we're landing our first punches.
[00:54:32.071 --> 00:54:35.293]  So we're already bloodied and stabbed, but we're a lot tougher than the enemy.
[00:54:35.674 --> 00:54:39.497]  And so yeah, we're going to be on top of them very soon throwing elbows right into their eye sockets.
[00:54:40.057 --> 00:54:42.779]  And basically we're going to tear their head off non-violently as a metaphor.
[00:54:43.159 --> 00:54:49.504]  But no, we're about to bash their brains out and knock their teeth out and break their ribs and pull their eyeballs out.
[00:54:49.544 --> 00:54:50.085]  Politically.
[00:54:50.165 --> 00:54:51.165]  Politically non-violently.
[00:54:51.265 --> 00:54:52.346]  I mean literally though.
[00:54:53.147 --> 00:55:04.996]  We just now woke up, we're getting beat, we're bleeding, we start getting up fighting, we throw a couple of shots and they already ran up against the wall and are like, whoa, and we just got to get in there and just get going and we're going to win this thing brother.
[00:55:06.271 --> 00:55:10.533]  Well, and let me just make this as kind of proof positive of what we're talking about.
[00:55:11.494 --> 00:55:15.256]  Folks, I was in solitary confinement for quarantine for seven days.
[00:55:15.676 --> 00:55:16.997]  No access to anything.
[00:55:17.478 --> 00:55:25.022]  I got out, I made one phone call, they immediately put me back into solitary confinement where I remained for the first 26 days of my sentencing.
[00:55:25.774 --> 00:55:31.056]  Now, because of the political pressure, I was able to have a meeting with the warden.
[00:55:31.516 --> 00:55:33.017]  And I will give a shout-out to the warden.
[00:55:33.057 --> 00:55:37.478]  I think he treated me fairly and did as much for me as he possibly could, given the circumstances.
[00:55:37.518 --> 00:55:39.119]  I think he's a good man and a good American.
[00:55:40.723 --> 00:55:50.728]  When I sat down for that meeting, still cuffed, he looked at me like he was looking at a ghost or like some sort of a spirit or an apparition because he sits me down and he's like, what's going on?
[00:55:51.068 --> 00:55:52.249]  What are you telling the people?
[00:55:53.169 --> 00:55:54.450]  What is your message?
[00:55:54.490 --> 00:55:55.190]  What are you doing here?
[00:55:55.210 --> 00:55:55.610]  What's going on?
[00:55:55.630 --> 00:55:56.691]  And I'm just sitting there because I...
[00:55:57.091 --> 00:55:58.172]  I have no contact with the public!
[00:55:58.192 --> 00:55:59.452]  Hold on, hold on, I gotta go on a break.
[00:55:59.472 --> 00:56:01.794]  I gotta, to five more minutes, I gotta hear this story.
[00:56:01.814 --> 00:56:02.834]  You know, like, what have you done?
[00:56:03.135 --> 00:56:09.058]  A loving thing, oh, the prison's fine, thanks for the crew, thanks for the letter of support, love you all, God loves you, I love Jesus.
[00:56:09.338 --> 00:56:10.679]  They're like, what did you do?
[00:56:10.699 --> 00:56:14.221]  Because, you know, the feds called and said, throw that son of a bitch in a dungeon.
[00:56:14.401 --> 00:56:15.242]  I haven't heard this yet.
[00:56:15.522 --> 00:56:16.783]  We only talked like ten minutes this morning.
[00:56:17.103 --> 00:56:18.023]  Let's come back and talk about that.
[00:56:18.043 --> 00:56:21.846]  I'm gonna get into the Elon Musk, the Twitter, the wars, Biden nuclear blackmail.
[00:56:21.886 --> 00:56:23.787]  I mean, it's totally insane, but I gotta do this or we won't be here.

[00:57:14.251 --> 00:57:19.875]  I'm not going to get into a whole story explaining it, but the federal judge in the bankruptcy makes me pay out the legal bills.
[00:57:19.955 --> 00:57:20.515]  I have no money.
[00:57:20.555 --> 00:57:21.156]  I'm upside down.

[01:00:16.275 --> 01:00:17.095]  They're information.
[01:00:17.115 --> 01:00:18.596]  They're truth of the Holy Spirit.
[01:00:21.670 --> 01:00:23.351]  Give me back my Holy Spirit!
[01:00:27.914 --> 01:00:29.795]  Give me back the truth!

[01:00:45.163 --> 01:00:47.985]  Alright, only four minutes we got to break.
[01:00:49.329 --> 01:00:50.350]  Restart your story.
[01:00:50.930 --> 01:00:51.891]  You're in solitary.
[01:00:52.011 --> 01:00:53.532]  I guess the warden's ordered to throw you back.
[01:00:53.572 --> 01:00:55.133]  He calls you and he looks like he's seen a ghost.
[01:00:55.173 --> 01:00:56.054]  He knows this is wrong.
[01:00:56.534 --> 01:00:57.855]  He's stepping on the line.
[01:00:57.915 --> 01:00:58.856]  And then tell the story.
[01:01:01.078 --> 01:01:04.540]  Yeah, so obviously I get out of the solitary confinement quarantine.
[01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:06.322]  It was seven days in there.
[01:01:07.362 --> 01:01:13.327]  And I make one phone call thanking people for all their love and the support and the mail and the prayers.
[01:01:13.871 --> 01:01:20.456]  And then I get thrown right back into solitary in the SHU, as it's known, the Special Housing Unit, which is basically like a high security prison situation.
[01:01:20.857 --> 01:01:24.059]  No movement, locked up all day, three showers a week.
[01:01:24.099 --> 01:01:25.780]  You get cuffed every time you go to the shower.
[01:01:25.820 --> 01:01:26.461]  It's a whole thing.
[01:01:27.041 --> 01:01:29.964]  And so I have no connection with the outside.
[01:01:30.164 --> 01:01:32.146]  I'm not able to make phone calls.
[01:01:32.186 --> 01:01:33.827]  I'm not able to talk to you or anybody.
[01:01:33.867 --> 01:01:35.969]  I'm not able to talk to friends, family, lawyers, nothing.
[01:01:36.329 --> 01:01:37.790]  I'm just sitting in there rotting away.
[01:01:37.830 --> 01:01:39.211]  I have no idea what's going on.
[01:01:39.631 --> 01:01:41.433]  And so after a couple of weeks of that,
[01:01:42.239 --> 01:01:44.942]  The warden comes by and he pulls me out and I have a meeting with him.
[01:01:45.402 --> 01:01:48.965]  And he's looking at me like he's looking at the reincarnation of Moses or something.
[01:01:49.266 --> 01:01:50.407]  And I don't know what's going on.
[01:01:50.447 --> 01:01:52.529]  And he's like, tell me, like, what's your agenda here?
[01:01:52.569 --> 01:01:53.409]  What are you trying to do?
[01:01:53.750 --> 01:01:54.550]  And I don't know what's going on.
[01:01:54.570 --> 01:01:58.354]  And I just say, oh, well, I just made a phone call to thank people for the letters.
[01:01:58.394 --> 01:01:59.115]  Like, did you hear it?
[01:01:59.195 --> 01:02:01.577]  I wasn't trying to cause any trouble because I don't know what's going on.
[01:02:01.617 --> 01:02:05.901]  And then I realized at that point, he's like, OK, he really doesn't know what's going on.
[01:02:06.381 --> 01:02:09.464]  But then he brings up, he's like, I'm getting all this political pressure.
[01:02:09.524 --> 01:02:10.445]  I'm hearing from lawyers.
[01:02:10.485 --> 01:02:11.826]  We're hearing from Congress members.
[01:02:11.846 --> 01:02:14.309]  We're getting brought up during congressional hearings and all this stuff.
[01:02:14.809 --> 01:02:18.512]  And I guess they thought somehow I was running it from my cell.
[01:02:18.612 --> 01:02:24.498]  I guess they thought somehow that I was the man pulling the strings on all of this and I had no connection with the outside world.
[01:02:24.838 --> 01:02:28.862]  And I think it kind of hit maybe him at that point like, oh, this is all organic.
[01:02:29.562 --> 01:02:37.464]  This is the American people, this is people trying to get the truth out, and this man really has been treated extremely wrong.
[01:02:37.904 --> 01:02:40.685]  Well that's right, the left is in their bubble.
[01:02:41.345 --> 01:02:42.645]  They always say the right's in a bubble.
[01:02:42.665 --> 01:02:43.445]  No, we're not in a bubble.
[01:02:43.465 --> 01:02:53.328]  We're out here running the country, actually plowing the fields, driving the trucks, taking care of the kids, stopping the criminals, you know, busting our ass, and we're in the real world and the left
[01:02:54.168 --> 01:02:56.930]  And they're minions, and this guy's probably not allowed this, but he works for them.
[01:02:57.350 --> 01:03:00.512]  They don't get, we know what's going on, we're watching, we're pissed, man.
[01:03:01.373 --> 01:03:04.955]  They don't get that they've wrongly attacked, we see the attack, the country's being destroyed.
[01:03:06.084 --> 01:03:15.409]  When you're locking up journalists and filing fake federal filings that you did all these horrible things, people see that and they know they're next.
[01:03:15.789 --> 01:03:18.811]  They have empathy because they care about themselves.
[01:03:18.851 --> 01:03:21.452]  See, evil people don't have empathy because they're dumb.
[01:03:21.472 --> 01:03:24.133]  Empathy is the most selfish thing on earth, folks.
[01:03:24.433 --> 01:03:26.614]  When you have empathy, it's because you care about yourself.
[01:03:27.035 --> 01:03:31.617]  And that's by extension you care about others, but that's in-programmed in you so we all take care of each other.
[01:03:31.637 --> 01:03:33.358]  60 seconds closing comment, Owen.
[01:03:35.444 --> 01:03:40.708]  Well, I'm going to take some time to contemplate what I'm going to talk about from the inside as far as that's concerned.
[01:03:40.728 --> 01:03:42.749]  But no, there aren't leftists that run this thing.
[01:03:43.150 --> 01:03:45.491]  All the people on the inside, most of the people are good people.
[01:03:45.531 --> 01:03:47.973]  They know that... No, no, I'm not saying leftists run it.
[01:03:48.033 --> 01:03:51.375]  I'm saying the policies of the government to throw you in jail was the left.
[01:03:52.896 --> 01:03:55.058]  Yeah, and that's what I'm saying.
[01:03:55.338 --> 01:03:56.159]  But let me just say this.
[01:03:56.795 --> 01:04:07.563]  Before I left, I had another meeting with the warden, who I think is a good American, and he said, Mr. Schroeder, in 27 years of working in the criminal justice system, I've never seen anybody get railroaded like you have.
[01:04:08.163 --> 01:04:09.104]  And he shook my hand.
[01:04:09.564 --> 01:04:13.327]  And so again, like, when I was sitting there and he was looking at me, he was like, how are you doing all of this?
[01:04:13.367 --> 01:04:16.869]  Like, how is it possible for you to be causing me all this problems when you're sitting in the cell?
[01:04:17.169 --> 01:04:18.430]  And then he realized it wasn't me!
[01:04:18.970 --> 01:04:20.291]  This was the American people!
[01:04:20.772 --> 01:04:25.355]  And so, it was really a message, to finish off what we started in the last segment, it was a message that folks,
[01:04:26.269 --> 01:04:27.710]  They can destroy Owen Schroyer.
[01:04:27.750 --> 01:04:28.851]  They can destroy Alex Jones.
[01:04:28.871 --> 01:04:29.732]  They can lock us up.
[01:04:29.772 --> 01:04:31.193]  They can rip out our vocal cords.
[01:04:31.513 --> 01:04:33.095]  The American people are alive.
[01:04:33.375 --> 01:04:35.096]  The Holy Spirit is alive.
[01:04:35.377 --> 01:04:39.160]  And our divine creation is manifest destiny in our future.
[01:04:40.201 --> 01:04:40.641]  Absolutely.
[01:04:40.661 --> 01:04:42.983]  They'll probably come after the warden because he didn't say he was redeeming.
[01:04:43.283 --> 01:04:44.524]  Owen, can't wait to shake your hand.
[01:04:44.544 --> 01:04:45.325]  Can't wait to go to dinner.
[01:04:45.345 --> 01:04:48.788]  They're going to get back and take care of your family and your turtle and all the rest of it.
[01:04:48.808 --> 01:04:49.268]  We love you.
[01:04:49.629 --> 01:04:51.630]  And we'll see you here back in Austin, Texas soon.
[01:04:51.650 --> 01:04:52.271]  God bless, Owen.
[01:04:55.003 --> 01:04:56.444]  Wow, this is the real world, folks.
[01:04:56.764 --> 01:04:57.604]  This isn't Netflix.
[01:04:59.745 --> 01:05:03.206]  Never forget that the answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:05:04.607 --> 01:05:08.849]  We've come a long way in the fight against tyranny, and it's been listeners and viewers like you that have kept us on air.
[01:05:09.009 --> 01:05:16.392]  That's why we bring you the very best products, so you love them, so you enjoy them, as you come back and get them again and again, so we can stay on the air in the fight against the globalists.
[01:05:16.612 --> 01:05:18.753]  Because it's viewers like you that keep this operation on air.
[01:05:19.233 --> 01:05:22.335]  And here we are, another Christmas is here, being the biggest sale of the year.

[01:05:43.848 --> 01:05:48.031]  I want to encourage you now to get storewide free shipping, double Patriot points,

[01:05:54.916 --> 01:05:58.479]  InfoWareStore.com.
[01:06:07.626 --> 01:06:12.550]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:17.825 --> 01:06:19.046]  We're in the danger zone.
[01:06:19.486 --> 01:06:21.848]  All humans on the planet Earth are in the danger zone.
[01:06:22.589 --> 01:06:33.178]  Not just from solar flares or nuclear weapons or crime, but from the spirit of evil trying to invade our psyches and our will and break us and turn us towards darkness.
[01:06:34.019 --> 01:06:43.027]  But when evil launches its main attack, when evil comes in like a flood, the spirit of the Lord lifts up a standard against it.
[01:06:52.126 --> 01:07:04.034]  InfoWars is the highway to the danger zone.
[01:07:04.794 --> 01:07:08.176]  To the front lines, the fight for our species' future.
[01:07:09.117 --> 01:07:10.658]  There's no words to hype it up enough.
[01:07:11.971 --> 01:07:14.173]  If you're some delusional leftist, you tune in and laugh.
[01:07:14.633 --> 01:07:24.601]  But if you're living in the real world, you know we're going toe-to-toe with Soros and the Rothschilds and the New World Order, and we're beginning to turn the tide!
[01:07:26.323 --> 01:07:28.544]  Just like when Beowulf grabs Grimble by the arm.
[01:07:29.565 --> 01:07:30.686]  He says, you're not leaving.
[01:07:30.726 --> 01:07:32.728]  I'm gonna tear your arm out of its socket.
[01:07:33.889 --> 01:07:34.549]  We got them.
[01:07:35.450 --> 01:07:36.411]  They don't have us.
[01:07:37.071 --> 01:07:37.712]  We got them.
[01:07:37.732 --> 01:07:38.753]  They're not
[01:07:40.404 --> 01:07:40.965]  Gonna win.
[01:07:41.885 --> 01:07:43.487]  We're not locked in here with them.
[01:07:44.128 --> 01:07:45.909]  They're locked in here with us.
[01:07:51.835 --> 01:07:52.456]  And I'm gonna be clear.
[01:07:54.940 --> 01:07:58.741]  When I say those are metaphors for violence, it isn't a proviso to cover for violence.
[01:07:58.862 --> 01:07:59.242]  I mean it.
[01:07:59.762 --> 01:08:10.446]  When I talk about will and action and use the analogy of fighting, I mean fighting culturally, fighting spiritually, fighting by the decisions we make.
[01:08:10.526 --> 01:08:16.688]  That is a hundred times, at least, more effective than going and shooting people.
[01:08:17.929 --> 01:08:20.310]  Because evil has a lot of depth.
[01:08:21.110 --> 01:08:22.771]  It's got a lot of people on its bench.
[01:08:24.128 --> 01:08:27.811]  And it's not like a human that gets two sets of teeth in our life, or an elephant that gets three sets.
[01:08:28.132 --> 01:08:28.932]  It's like sharks.
[01:08:29.313 --> 01:08:30.433]  They got a hundred rows.
[01:08:30.614 --> 01:08:33.816]  You pull some out, they just roll forward.
[01:08:34.197 --> 01:08:34.717]  New teeth.
[01:08:34.757 --> 01:08:36.959]  You don't pull teeth off a shark.
[01:08:36.999 --> 01:08:38.961]  You don't cut single heads off a hydra.
[01:08:39.301 --> 01:08:45.626]  You attack the entire thing and what it stands for, and you starve it out, and you stab it in the heart with truth.
[01:08:48.909 --> 01:08:52.092]  All right, I pontificated and covered some news the first hour.
[01:08:53.579 --> 01:08:56.622]  And I do now want to open the phones up throughout the broadcast.
[01:08:57.342 --> 01:09:02.306]  I will give the number out coming up here in about five minutes.
[01:09:02.366 --> 01:09:09.472]  So we'll get the phone system fired up, get somebody at that communication desk so we can start doing that.
[01:09:11.854 --> 01:09:15.217]  And we have the best calls when I say this is the topic.
[01:09:16.075 --> 01:09:22.297]  I love the wildcard thing, but the listeners have actually told me, and we get feedback, we like it when you have certain topics and we stick to that.
[01:09:22.397 --> 01:09:29.019]  So we'll still do wildcard quite a bit, but we're going to stick to three major gigantic huge topics.
[01:09:29.119 --> 01:09:30.380]  So it's very easy.
[01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:33.941]  Anything you want to talk about, you can work into those topics because it's all interconnected.
[01:09:35.580 --> 01:09:37.841]  Biden wanting World War III, saying U.S.
[01:09:37.861 --> 01:09:41.022]  troops are going to start dying, we're going to attack Russia with U.S.
[01:09:41.042 --> 01:09:45.023]  troops if you don't give another $106 billion, and then it'll just be the same threat over and over again.
[01:09:45.423 --> 01:09:48.364]  Once you feed the pirate, it never ends.
[01:09:50.525 --> 01:09:51.165]  So we have that.
[01:09:52.045 --> 01:09:57.807]  And the Secretary of Defense has now come out and told Congress, I'll read the quotes here, your sons and daughters will be dying within a month.
[01:09:58.487 --> 01:10:00.367]  We'll be in full war with Russia if you don't do this.
[01:10:00.467 --> 01:10:01.108]  I mean, wow.
[01:10:01.568 --> 01:10:02.888]  Russia's going to invade all of Europe.
[01:10:02.948 --> 01:10:05.049]  I mean, just made up horse manure.
[01:10:06.189 --> 01:10:18.754]  But that's their crisis ahead of the election that Jack Posobiec and Steve Bannon and myself and all of us have, and Tucker Carlson have predicted for a year, their October surprise is full war with Russia.
[01:10:18.814 --> 01:10:20.354]  And they're that freaking crazy, okay?
[01:10:20.374 --> 01:10:21.555]  I mean, they're nuts.
[01:10:23.135 --> 01:10:26.297]  So to me, that's numero uno of the topics.
[01:10:26.337 --> 01:10:27.277]  I want your take on that.
[01:10:28.397 --> 01:10:34.360]  Then, the war for free speech, they already stole the last few elections, mitigated the last one, we would have had a landslide.
[01:10:35.299 --> 01:10:40.724]  Manipulating the data, the stories you see, they admit that that's where the real election fraud happens, then the mail-in ballots.
[01:10:41.745 --> 01:10:42.806]  What do you make of Elon Musk?
[01:10:42.826 --> 01:10:46.589]  And I'll show you the tweets and all the rest of it coming out saying, yeah, he's looking very strongly at reinvigorating Alex Jones.
[01:10:46.609 --> 01:10:49.391]  There are a whole bunch of polls upwards of 85% on average.
[01:10:50.532 --> 01:10:51.313]  They're all in the 80s.
[01:10:52.173 --> 01:10:53.054]  I saw dozens of them.
[01:10:53.074 --> 01:10:54.275]  Some had hundreds of thousands of votes.
[01:10:54.556 --> 01:10:55.476]  Some had like 20,000 votes, 10,000 votes.
[01:10:55.496 --> 01:10:56.137]  But they're all above 85, 89.
[01:10:56.197 --> 01:10:57.298]  None of them really crested 90.
[01:11:01.974 --> 01:11:03.776]  But 80 plus percent say reinstate Alex Jones.
[01:11:03.836 --> 01:11:05.497]  It's not about reinstating Alex Jones.
[01:11:05.537 --> 01:11:06.598]  I was never even good at tweeting.
[01:11:07.659 --> 01:11:15.927]  It's that all the ADL pressure, all the CHICOM pressure, all the New World Order pressure is keep Alex Jones off Twitter.
[01:11:16.547 --> 01:11:18.870]  It's that symbol of the populace they fear so much.
[01:11:20.171 --> 01:11:21.872]  And so, and then you bring Gavin McGinnis back on.
[01:11:21.892 --> 01:11:24.555]  That guy did nothing, except be funny, and that's what they're scared of.
[01:11:24.575 --> 01:11:25.256]  The guy's hilarious.
[01:11:26.328 --> 01:11:27.669]  And I should be more funny.
[01:11:27.749 --> 01:11:30.330]  People have told me, man, the most successful thing you did was jokes.
[01:11:31.151 --> 01:11:34.853]  I've just gotten so serious the last five, six years, you don't ever see it because I'm just so damn serious.
[01:11:35.273 --> 01:11:37.834]  Not as happy as I used to be, but I've been trying to get back to being funnier.
[01:11:38.434 --> 01:11:39.355]  Believe me, I need to do it.
[01:11:40.616 --> 01:11:52.282]  So, there's the topic of the Tucker Carlson interview and Elon Musk saying he's looking to bring me back as early as next week and a lot of other stuff's happening behind the scenes and how are they going to respond to that?
[01:11:54.284 --> 01:11:58.467]  And then I want to talk about Hunter Biden and the impeachment of Biden, because here's the deal.
[01:11:59.727 --> 01:12:02.809]  The Republicans could have impeached him for a long time.
[01:12:04.751 --> 01:12:09.133]  But a year into them, they haven't done it, because at the top, they're still controlled to a great extent.
[01:12:10.234 --> 01:12:21.221]  But now that corporate media has come out against Biden, and now that Hunter's been indicted nine times for all this money laundering and tax evasion,
[01:12:22.469 --> 01:12:25.971]  They want Biden to step aside for Big Mike and Gavin Newsom.
[01:12:25.991 --> 01:12:26.892]  American Psycho.
[01:12:27.473 --> 01:12:28.093]  Patrick Bateman 2.0.
[01:12:30.054 --> 01:12:30.775]  Delta 10.0.
[01:12:31.976 --> 01:12:33.757]  And so you can sit back and go, oh good, we're winning!
[01:12:33.777 --> 01:12:34.417]  Biden, Biden!
[01:12:34.818 --> 01:12:36.139]  And I'm not saying don't impeach Biden.
[01:12:36.579 --> 01:12:43.884]  But make the impeachment about all his lackeys and the globalists around him and the Democratic Party and insider trading and Nancy Pelosi.
[01:12:44.224 --> 01:12:46.306]  But a bunch of the Republicans are insider trading too.
[01:12:46.666 --> 01:12:51.710]  That's why they don't want to upset the apple cart at the endangerment of the whole world.
[01:12:52.549 --> 01:12:56.932]  It's not, oh, we sent 106 billion more to Ukraine to be laundered back, or we go to World War III.
[01:12:56.952 --> 01:12:57.892]  They're already starting it.
[01:12:59.113 --> 01:13:00.894]  Oh, the world's going to end because of global warming.
[01:13:00.934 --> 01:13:09.359]  No, the world's ending as we know it, because you're cutting off the resources, and there's 8 billion people, and that'll cause giant wars, and collapsing countries, and giant migrant flows.
[01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:13.081]  So it probably won't end the world, but you'll think it's over.
[01:13:13.361 --> 01:13:14.402]  The world as you know it.
[01:13:15.442 --> 01:13:18.184]  It's the end of the world as we know it.
[01:13:18.804 --> 01:13:21.406]  It's the end of the world as we know it.
[01:13:22.762 --> 01:13:23.943]  And I don't feel fine.
[01:13:23.963 --> 01:13:26.765]  Let's come back with Neil Young next segment with that.
[01:13:28.186 --> 01:13:31.148]  Because, again, it's so simple what they do.
[01:13:32.149 --> 01:13:33.029]  You're killing the earth.
[01:13:33.330 --> 01:13:35.071]  Give us all your power, roll over and die.
[01:13:35.371 --> 01:13:37.192]  You'll all be dead soon because you're bad.
[01:13:37.412 --> 01:13:39.214]  Well, they cut off the resources on purpose.
[01:13:39.534 --> 01:13:41.635]  They're creating the global crisis.
[01:13:43.076 --> 01:13:44.057]  This is going on.
[01:13:44.117 --> 01:13:44.978]  This is happening.
[01:13:45.458 --> 01:13:46.519]  This is the reality.
[01:13:46.579 --> 01:13:49.561]  So, Tucker Carlson, the free speech fight,
[01:13:52.392 --> 01:13:55.574]  Nuclear war, Biden threatening invasion, U.S.
[01:13:55.594 --> 01:13:58.256]  troops directly fighting Russians, which has already been going on.
[01:13:58.496 --> 01:13:59.957]  They're talking about official war.
[01:14:01.157 --> 01:14:02.698]  I mean, this is crazy.
[01:14:04.239 --> 01:14:07.781]  And then, of course, the impeachment and all the rest of it.
[01:14:07.821 --> 01:14:09.823]  So it's the Bidens and what's happening there.
[01:14:10.243 --> 01:14:12.284]  It's the war being expanded massively.
[01:14:12.684 --> 01:14:13.985]  It's the battle for free speech.
[01:14:14.425 --> 01:14:17.327]  Three gigantic topics.
[01:14:20.889 --> 01:14:21.810]  Phone systems now open.
[01:14:23.629 --> 01:14:27.833]  Ladies and gentlemen, here's the toll-free number to join us for First Time Callers. 877.
[01:14:32.514 --> 01:14:45.124]  789-2539, 877-789-Alex, 877-789-2539 are the coordinates to get live on air to millions of listeners.
[01:14:45.144 --> 01:14:50.088]  And we've always got millions of listeners a day that listen live, and then millions that watch the clips after.
[01:14:50.468 --> 01:14:56.172]  But today we've got millions of new people saying, I'm going to go to InfoWars.com.
[01:14:56.232 --> 01:15:00.176]  I'm going to tap in to the verboten, the forbidden.
[01:15:01.224 --> 01:15:03.024]  I'm going to find out what this is all about.
[01:15:03.145 --> 01:15:04.385]  Why don't they want us to hear this?
[01:15:04.445 --> 01:15:06.585]  And then you tune in and you're like, well, I already think that.
[01:15:06.605 --> 01:15:07.326]  I already know that.
[01:15:07.926 --> 01:15:08.546]  That's true.
[01:15:08.606 --> 01:15:10.466]  Well, yeah, I'm just telling you what you already know.
[01:15:11.187 --> 01:15:12.747]  And say, let's organize and do something about this.
[01:15:13.607 --> 01:15:23.950]  Let's not teach that black people are inherently evil because of what color they are, or that white people are inherently evil because of what color they are, that the left is teaching that white people are bad to create racial division and all this control.
[01:15:23.990 --> 01:15:28.371]  Let's not accept 400 plus thousand missing children and sex slavery run by O'Biden.
[01:15:29.241 --> 01:15:30.582]  Let's not accept the war.
[01:15:30.602 --> 01:15:32.003]  Let's not accept the pedophilia.
[01:15:32.023 --> 01:15:34.184]  Let's not accept the transgender mutilation cult.
[01:15:34.224 --> 01:15:35.004]  Let's say no.
[01:15:35.025 --> 01:15:35.265]  877-789-2539.
[01:15:35.605 --> 01:15:43.570]  All right, I'm going to get into Elon Musk and what he said and what happened with Twitter and more Tucker Carlson.
[01:15:43.630 --> 01:15:45.151]  It's a big broadcast.
[01:15:45.931 --> 01:15:47.892]  I'll still be on air for an hour and 45 minutes.
[01:15:47.932 --> 01:15:55.297]  And then the amazing, informative, right from their own documents, Jay Dyer will be hosting the fourth hour ahead of the war room with Chase Geyser.
[01:15:55.457 --> 01:15:56.958]  And then Owen's back Monday.
[01:15:59.189 --> 01:16:02.130]  I say this, I mean it from the very bottom of my heart.
[01:16:03.211 --> 01:16:07.352]  I want to say thank you to all the viewers and listeners for supporting the broadcast over the years.
[01:16:07.832 --> 01:16:14.315]  We together have changed the world at an incredible level and I want to salute the crew as well and all of our sponsors and supporters.
[01:16:14.755 --> 01:16:18.757]  Ladies and gentlemen, wow, the fight has really been joined with a globalist.
[01:16:19.797 --> 01:16:27.303]  And as we go into 2024, the most important election in world history, it is now more important than ever to get around the censors and override the globalists.
[01:16:27.323 --> 01:16:28.984]  So keep spreading the word about the broadcast.
[01:16:29.424 --> 01:16:30.585]  Keep sharing the article's videos.
[01:16:30.985 --> 01:16:33.887]  Keep praying for the broadcast and our reporters and the crew.
[01:16:34.268 --> 01:16:41.433]  And shop at infowarestore.com, where for Christmas, we have the biggest sales of the year, double Patriot points, store-wide free shipping,

[01:16:59.508 --> 01:17:02.751]  If you ever take one piece of my advice,
[01:17:03.732 --> 01:17:04.713]  It's got a bottle of X2.
[01:17:05.714 --> 01:17:09.977]  It's been sold out for over a year because we wouldn't cut corners and because it's so hard to produce.
[01:17:10.377 --> 01:17:14.841]  We finally have a limited run back in supply at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:17:16.202 --> 01:17:18.944]  So many people have serious issues.
[01:17:19.264 --> 01:17:20.385]  Look at the UN's own numbers.
[01:17:20.825 --> 01:17:26.249]  Billions have cognitive disabilities because they do not have true nascent iodine in their bodies.
[01:17:26.790 --> 01:17:29.151]  Most of their iodine is bound to other heavy metals or
[01:17:30.032 --> 01:17:32.192]  Bound to other elements so you don't download it.
[01:17:32.793 --> 01:17:38.533]  But this is pure atomic certified iodine.
[01:17:38.774 --> 01:17:41.454]  X2 is now back in stock, discounted.
[01:17:41.794 --> 01:17:44.975]  So I'm giving Thanksgiving right now for this product being here.

[01:17:50.576 --> 01:17:51.376]  It is amazing.
[01:17:51.696 --> 01:17:53.336]  It's the Missing Link X2.
[01:17:53.816 --> 01:17:55.736]  Back in stock at the end of 2023 at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:17:55.756 --> 01:17:55.776]  X2.
[01:17:59.795 --> 01:18:02.177]  Thanksgiving 2023 is here.
[01:18:02.937 --> 01:18:07.860]  And I'm giving Thanksgiving for all we've done against tyranny and your incredible support together in this fight.
[01:18:08.381 --> 01:18:19.728]  And I'm particularly giving Thanksgiving that X2, our number one product, the only true atomic iodine on the market after a year plus of being sold out, is finally back in stock, ready to ship now.
[01:18:20.309 --> 01:18:24.211]  If you don't know the power of X2 and the iodine conspiracy, you are insane.
[01:18:24.892 --> 01:18:25.952]  Get X2 now.
[01:18:26.013 --> 01:18:27.053]  It could be the last run ever.
[01:18:27.093 --> 01:18:27.834]  We get shut down.
[01:18:28.274 --> 01:18:29.135]  While you still can,
[01:18:30.155 --> 01:18:37.460]  At InfoWarsTore.com, research iodine deficiency and billions of people with cognitive disabilities because they don't have it.
[01:18:38.100 --> 01:18:38.701]  X2.
[01:18:39.221 --> 01:18:39.781]  X2.
[01:18:40.322 --> 01:18:43.644]  X2 is now back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:18:43.664 --> 01:18:46.806]  It takes a few weeks to kick in, but it is the building block to everything.
[01:18:46.866 --> 01:18:47.546]  It's the missing link.
[01:18:47.566 --> 01:18:51.628]  They bomb us with the fluoride that is in the same family but has the opposite effect.
[01:18:52.089 --> 01:18:55.611]  This is the holy grail of supplements and empowering yourself.
[01:18:55.791 --> 01:18:57.472]  X2, back in stock right now.
[01:18:57.512 --> 01:18:58.633]  Discount at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:19:00.023 --> 01:19:07.147]  Sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days, with everything that's going on both at home and the world at large.
[01:19:07.688 --> 01:19:15.452]  If you're having trouble getting to that deep sleep we could all use more of, our new sleep support formula, Down and Out, is just the thing.
[01:19:16.253 --> 01:19:22.617]  It's our new, faster-absorbing liquid formula that is specifically designed to help you get the shut-eye you deserve.
[01:19:23.257 --> 01:19:33.183]  Formulated to improve upon our best-selling product, Knockout, with Down and Out, now the herbs and melatonin packed inside are extracted directly into the glycerin solution.
[01:19:33.684 --> 01:19:38.086]  So the ingredients are already dissolved into the formula before you even take it.
[01:19:38.507 --> 01:19:42.209]  One of the other sleep support herbs included is the Passionflower.
[01:19:42.449 --> 01:19:48.711]  Which was traditionally used by Native Americans like the Cherokees, who used it for its relaxing qualities.
[01:19:49.092 --> 01:19:54.974]  Be sure to take this product when you are completely ready for sleep, because you will be down and out.
[01:19:55.254 --> 01:19:58.695]  Selling out now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:20:00.316 --> 01:20:06.198]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:17.644 --> 01:20:23.586]  I said Neil Young, it's R.E.M.
[01:20:23.806 --> 01:20:33.148]  I'm glad the critics are here to correct me.
[01:20:39.432 --> 01:20:40.693]  World War III extortion.
[01:20:40.753 --> 01:20:42.534]  Biden regime threatens to deploy U.S.
[01:20:42.554 --> 01:20:47.178]  troops to fight Russia, unless Congress passes $100-plus billion Ukraine war funding.
[01:20:48.899 --> 01:20:51.320]  You like living under this?
[01:20:52.061 --> 01:20:52.621]  Feel safe?
[01:20:53.302 --> 01:20:54.102]  Like what's going on?
[01:20:54.483 --> 01:20:55.163]  No, none of you do.
[01:20:55.183 --> 01:21:01.928]  You got all these leftists that are conformists working for the system, pretending like they're the winning team.
[01:21:02.068 --> 01:21:03.349]  What you are is a death cult.
[01:21:09.730 --> 01:21:12.072]  All right, we're loading the phone lines up right now.
[01:21:12.092 --> 01:21:14.113]  We'll be going to your phone calls here very soon.
[01:21:17.055 --> 01:21:17.615]  But wow.
[01:21:19.336 --> 01:21:23.319]  The Tucker Carlson interview dropped about an hour early.
[01:21:23.359 --> 01:21:24.200]  They told me 7 p.m.
[01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:24.580]  Central.
[01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:25.400]  It dropped at 6 p.m.
[01:21:25.420 --> 01:21:25.761]  Central.
[01:21:26.461 --> 01:21:29.803]  It's gone super viral, and the clips have particularly gone viral.
[01:21:29.823 --> 01:21:30.964]  Some of them have 10 million views.
[01:21:31.744 --> 01:21:38.589]  And we did about a 95-minute interview, and
[01:21:41.949 --> 01:21:42.909]  It's a benchmark.
[01:21:44.190 --> 01:21:48.832]  And it's a road sign.
[01:21:48.872 --> 01:21:54.173]  It's a marker of telling people the way we're going and what's going to happen.
[01:21:54.874 --> 01:22:02.136]  And as everything I talked about in that interview begins to come true, because I'm not just here to tell you how I was right about stuff in the past.
[01:22:02.456 --> 01:22:03.917]  No, we're here tomorrow's news today.
[01:22:05.277 --> 01:22:09.379]  This interview is evergreen and will be explosively evergreen.
[01:22:10.828 --> 01:22:14.129]  I mean there's like certain movies that just are timeless and get better as the years go on.
[01:22:14.149 --> 01:22:19.751]  The Wizard of Oz, Christmas Story, things like that.
[01:22:19.771 --> 01:22:22.311]  There's other movies that aren't good later.
[01:22:22.371 --> 01:22:23.192]  They're not timeless.
[01:22:23.272 --> 01:22:30.554]  This will be a timeless interview because I laid nothing out but facts and
[01:22:32.116 --> 01:22:34.537]  The goal is not to be right when all those horrible things happen.
[01:22:35.158 --> 01:22:37.559]  The goal is, I already told you these horrible things were going to happen.
[01:22:37.599 --> 01:22:38.259]  They did happen.
[01:22:38.819 --> 01:22:40.100]  Now you know we're telling the truth.
[01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:42.181]  Let's talk about stopping this.
[01:22:42.221 --> 01:22:45.202]  And as it begins to happen, then people are really going to wake up.
[01:22:45.282 --> 01:22:46.963]  And that was the vision God gave me.
[01:22:48.564 --> 01:22:49.885]  Just the understanding.
[01:22:49.925 --> 01:22:52.886]  I talked about, I've been on the air about three years, so I guess about 1996.
[01:22:55.737 --> 01:22:57.398]  I don't remember the exact date.
[01:22:58.198 --> 01:22:59.938]  I've talked about this 100 times, probably 200 times.
[01:23:00.418 --> 01:23:01.599]  You're probably saying, please don't tell it again.
[01:23:01.619 --> 01:23:02.299]  Well, we have new listeners.
[01:23:03.219 --> 01:23:07.561]  I'm in a restaurant after a two-hour local TV show, doing a radio show, eating a chicken fried steak.
[01:23:07.581 --> 01:23:08.361]  The place is closing.
[01:23:08.401 --> 01:23:09.401]  It's almost 10 o'clock at night.
[01:23:10.322 --> 01:23:15.023]  And it was like, you feel the atmosphere changing like this.
[01:23:15.043 --> 01:23:18.124]  30 minutes of me just sitting there with God communicating with me and saying,
[01:23:19.895 --> 01:23:20.636]  Here's the plan.
[01:23:20.716 --> 01:23:24.899]  You're going to lay out all the stuff they're planning, and then people aren't going to listen to you.
[01:23:25.299 --> 01:23:25.840]  Some will.
[01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:29.642]  And then when it all comes true in the first enemy phase, this is not my brain.
[01:23:29.682 --> 01:23:30.243]  This is God.
[01:23:30.263 --> 01:23:31.944]  And I'm sitting there.
[01:23:32.224 --> 01:23:35.367]  It's way more powerful and complex and just so much data.
[01:23:35.407 --> 01:23:37.568]  It's like the hair on the back of your neck is standing up.
[01:23:37.588 --> 01:23:38.369]  You're getting chills.
[01:23:38.909 --> 01:23:42.072]  You're like, like you stuck your finger in a light socket.
[01:23:43.274 --> 01:23:52.238]  And God's like, but then, they're gonna listen to you once the stuff comes true, and then you can tell them the next phase, and we'll be able to mitigate that, and they'll be flesh spared.
[01:23:53.278 --> 01:23:55.819]  So it's revelation level stuff, and I'm like, whoa.
[01:23:58.540 --> 01:24:00.421]  And God's like, but there's a proviso.
[01:24:00.941 --> 01:24:06.623]  You're gonna have to get really attacked and hurt, and it's gonna feel really bad for a long time, and you've gotta be ready.
[01:24:07.244 --> 01:24:10.485]  At a certain point, you're gonna spur, and your audience is gonna spur,
[01:24:12.037 --> 01:24:13.177]  A whole movement against this.
[01:24:13.197 --> 01:24:14.978]  You're going to see all these great new leaders pop up.
[01:24:15.558 --> 01:24:18.278]  You have to be ready to support that and not want to be the leader.
[01:24:19.158 --> 01:24:20.079]  And I was like, absolutely.
[01:24:20.099 --> 01:24:21.119]  I don't want to be the leader.
[01:24:21.139 --> 01:24:22.259]  God said, well, that's why I chose you.
[01:24:22.739 --> 01:24:23.639]  You accept this mission.
[01:24:23.679 --> 01:24:24.900]  I said, I accept this mission.
[01:24:25.380 --> 01:24:25.900]  I said it out loud.
[01:24:25.940 --> 01:24:27.140]  I said, I accept the mission.
[01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:29.900]  And God went, all right, you think you just got to download?
[01:24:30.281 --> 01:24:31.081]  Get ready for this.
[01:24:31.741 --> 01:24:32.141]  Bam!
[01:24:32.181 --> 01:24:37.462]  Like an anvil, a thousand pound anvil got dropped on my head like Wiley code or something.
[01:24:40.037 --> 01:24:42.898]  And it just all opened up from there.
[01:24:43.478 --> 01:24:45.579]  And I couldn't even understand the data I was being given.
[01:24:45.879 --> 01:24:48.500]  It took me years to even be able to understand.
[01:24:48.620 --> 01:24:48.881]  What?
[01:24:49.081 --> 01:24:55.723]  That's how this works in like 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 12th order responses.
[01:24:55.783 --> 01:24:56.704]  And how this would happen.
[01:24:56.724 --> 01:24:58.865]  And how the enemy would hit here and it would do all this.
[01:24:59.325 --> 01:25:00.385]  And I started like gibbering on air.
[01:25:00.405 --> 01:25:01.386]  This is going to happen.
[01:25:01.406 --> 01:25:02.506]  That's going to happen.
[01:25:02.566 --> 01:25:03.746]  I don't understand this.
[01:25:03.927 --> 01:25:05.627]  Because it's like so much data.
[01:25:05.907 --> 01:25:07.468]  And I'm here trying to explain it all to you.
[01:25:07.788 --> 01:25:11.130]  How do you describe what you're now living in 25 years ago?
[01:25:11.190 --> 01:25:12.551]  It just sounds insane!
[01:25:15.332 --> 01:25:21.375]  But God didn't just give us free will and just throw us out there like His children and say, I hope you figure it out.
[01:25:21.495 --> 01:25:26.158]  God has taught us, God has warned us, God has provisioned us for this.
[01:25:27.662 --> 01:25:29.364]  And the best term I use is a cheat sheet.
[01:25:29.384 --> 01:25:30.164]  And God doesn't cheat.
[01:25:30.204 --> 01:25:30.945]  It's not a cheat sheet.
[01:25:30.985 --> 01:25:31.666]  It's a manual.
[01:25:32.246 --> 01:25:32.787]  It's training.
[01:25:32.807 --> 01:25:38.432]  You go to the military and they don't, if you're a good military, they don't just give you a week of basic training and throw you into combat.
[01:25:38.992 --> 01:25:40.554]  The best military is you get years of training.
[01:25:42.138 --> 01:25:43.139]  And that's what this was.
[01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:55.189]  And now I can see back the perfection of God and all the training I went through and all the weight where God tested me and made sure, even though God already knew the outcome, it was about my process.
[01:25:55.790 --> 01:25:57.711]  And I know a lot of you have gone through that as well.
[01:25:59.192 --> 01:26:02.955]  So now, you've all gone through it, but a lot of you know you went through it.
[01:26:03.096 --> 01:26:03.936]  There's a better way to say it.
[01:26:04.797 --> 01:26:06.078]  That's the more accurate truth.
[01:26:07.199 --> 01:26:10.462]  Now you see it all opening up, just like the vision.
[01:26:11.437 --> 01:26:13.979]  And I told people about this 20 years ago.
[01:26:14.740 --> 01:26:31.092]  And people would make fun of me, other talk shows would call me and say, you got a vision from God that you're gonna spark with your audience, the global resistance, and that they won't listen to you up front, but a remnant will, and then that will trigger the global awakening.
[01:26:31.132 --> 01:26:32.934]  You're a megalomaniac.
[01:26:33.995 --> 01:26:35.576]  And I'm like, hey man, you weren't there, so.
[01:26:36.994 --> 01:26:40.376]  And God's done things like, here's a dream that's going to come true.
[01:26:41.137 --> 01:26:43.378]  And a lot of times it's some nonsensical thing.
[01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:49.082]  And like they're going to tear down the golf course.
[01:26:50.737 --> 01:26:50.977]  I don't
[01:27:08.877 --> 01:27:11.259]  I'm sitting on the back porch looking at this house that we built.
[01:27:11.299 --> 01:27:25.332]  I'm remembering the dream, and I remember in the dream, a cat walks up to the top window of the house, and I'm sitting there, and then the cat walks up to the top window of the house, and I'm staring at 50, 60 yards at a cat at night at 10 p.m.
[01:27:25.392 --> 01:27:28.154]  on no drugs, nothing, and I'm like, oh my God.
[01:27:29.575 --> 01:27:31.057]  And God's like, yeah, I am God.
[01:27:32.375 --> 01:27:35.317]  I want you to know that that's how that works.
[01:27:36.078 --> 01:27:51.989]  And God will tell me, it happens all the time, get up, I don't have a clock in my bedroom, get up and go look at the microwave clock in the kitchen, it's going to be 447 exactly, or 325, 522, whatever, hundreds of times.
[01:27:52.029 --> 01:27:56.272]  But if you try to show somebody or duplicate it, it doesn't happen because it's like that
[01:27:57.253 --> 01:28:13.676]  Energy analysis they've done where it's been going for 50 years or 40 years where they'll have a particle and it's being observed it won't move through the lead block but if you stop observing it and then you turn the electron microscope back on it's past it it's like you're not allowed to see it.
[01:28:15.578 --> 01:28:16.518]  Because it's God.
[01:28:17.038 --> 01:28:27.401]  But it's God saying, alright, get up, go in the kitchen, or go in the bathroom, and then you go, and it's a digital clock, and it's always the exact number.
[01:28:27.841 --> 01:28:29.061]  And that's God telling me.
[01:28:29.081 --> 01:28:30.142]  You wanna know how real I am?
[01:28:30.482 --> 01:28:33.343]  God doesn't send some angel, I don't see Jesus in my bedroom, none of that.
[01:28:33.583 --> 01:28:34.443]  God just says, okay, get up.
[01:28:35.339 --> 01:28:42.525]  Walk out there, and you're about to, and every time, it's like this, it doesn't happen, when I wake up and go, okay, go look at the clock, you know the exact time.
[01:28:42.905 --> 01:28:46.608]  And God's like, yes, I'm God, and I want you to know right now, this is 100% real, you understand?
[01:28:46.628 --> 01:28:47.629]  I'm like, yes, yes, I understand.
[01:28:47.909 --> 01:28:57.016]  And I'm like, and I have faith now that it happens, but before I would always not believe it, I'd walk out, it would always be the exact same time, and then it would change the next minute.
[01:28:59.059 --> 01:29:08.211]  What would you do if there was a tyrannical totalitarian world government taking over whose plan was to kill 90% of the world population and they were already beginning to do it?
[01:29:08.691 --> 01:29:09.573]  You would rally against it?
[01:29:09.593 --> 01:29:10.133]  You would fight it?
[01:29:10.514 --> 01:29:11.856]  And that's what we're doing.
[01:29:12.336 --> 01:29:13.438]  This is the reality of 2023.
[01:29:14.659 --> 01:29:17.662]  I just want to thank listeners and viewers for your last year's support.
[01:29:17.963 --> 01:29:28.915]  I want to encourage you now more than ever to spread the word about the broadcast, to pray for the broadcast, to take clips and share it from the broadcast, and to buy products that enrich your life at InfoWarsaw.com.

[01:30:03.054 --> 01:30:07.178]  I want to say thank you to all the viewers and listeners for supporting the broadcast over the years.
[01:30:07.679 --> 01:30:10.902]  We together have changed the world at an incredible level.
[01:30:10.922 --> 01:30:14.146]  And I want to salute the crew as well and all of our sponsors and supporters.
[01:30:14.586 --> 01:30:18.611]  Ladies and gentlemen, wow, the fight has really been joined with a globalist.
[01:30:19.640 --> 01:30:27.148]  And as we go into 2024, the most important election in world history, it is now more important than ever to get around the censors and override the globalists.
[01:30:27.168 --> 01:30:28.829]  So keep spreading the word about the broadcast.
[01:30:29.270 --> 01:30:30.431]  Keep sharing your articles and videos.
[01:30:30.831 --> 01:30:33.714]  Keep praying for the broadcast and our reporters and the crew.
[01:30:34.115 --> 01:30:41.282]  And shop at infowarestore.com, where for Christmas, we have the biggest sales of the year, double Patreon points, store-wide free shipping,
[01:30:41.642 --> 01:30:44.684]  Where were you when humanity was fighting for its life?
[01:31:03.618 --> 01:31:08.180]  Where were you when the globalists were caught trafficking millions of children for sex slavery worldwide?
[01:31:08.801 --> 01:31:11.742]  Where were you when the New World Order was starting World War III with Russia?
[01:31:12.243 --> 01:31:12.943]  Well, I know where you are.
[01:31:13.323 --> 01:31:17.285]  You're watching and listening to Infowars.com right now, and I salute you and thank you.
[01:31:17.786 --> 01:31:23.669]  And I want to encourage all of you who've been in this fight so long to realize we've reached the critical juncture in the battle now.
[01:31:24.409 --> 01:31:30.976]  And a key tool in that fight is the Great Awakening, defeating the globalists and launching the next great renaissance.
[01:31:31.416 --> 01:31:34.619]  This is my second book, part two of The Great Recent and War for the World.
[01:31:35.059 --> 01:31:39.584]  It's a longer book, quite frankly a more powerful book, and just like the last book,
[01:31:39.884 --> 01:31:40.144]  We're good.
[01:32:00.683 --> 01:32:04.726]  I would thank you for everything you've done for the Infowar, but I know you're like me.
[01:32:04.786 --> 01:32:06.107]  You don't want my thanks.
[01:32:06.708 --> 01:32:12.652]  You want victory over the globalists and these devil worshipping child molesters, and you want them off your back and off your children's back.
[01:32:12.672 --> 01:32:13.393]  And you know what?
[01:32:13.853 --> 01:32:16.555]  I'm the same way, and that's why we're on the same damn team.
[01:32:17.135 --> 01:32:21.418]  And it's why Infowars has been delivering time and time again, when it's clutch time.
[01:32:23.732 --> 01:32:25.972]  Focus the people on taking action against the globalists.
[01:32:26.453 --> 01:32:29.573]  Because I'm committed to a future for humanity.
[01:32:30.193 --> 01:32:31.274]  And I know you are as well.
[01:32:31.834 --> 01:32:34.214]  So thank you for standing with us, because you are the Infowar.
[01:32:34.234 --> 01:32:37.435]  And I want to thank you for committing to stand with us however you can.
[01:32:37.455 --> 01:32:44.236]  From the bottom of my heart, from my family, and from the great crew at Infowars, I want to thank you all because you are the Infowar.
[01:32:44.256 --> 01:32:46.557]  And you know that's not just words, that's reality.
[01:32:47.651 --> 01:32:48.651]  You have made history.
[01:32:49.252 --> 01:32:50.452]  We have made history together.
[01:32:51.112 --> 01:32:55.233]  Infowars.com only has power because of you.
[01:32:55.693 --> 01:32:57.534]  And I suggest you use it.
[01:33:00.175 --> 01:33:06.137]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:10.438 --> 01:33:13.779]  Yesterday, December 7th, 1941, a date which will live
[01:33:18.642 --> 01:33:19.463]  In infamy.
[01:33:19.924 --> 01:33:24.731]  Intelligence knew that Japanese task force was steaming with Admiral Yamamoto to attack.
[01:33:25.152 --> 01:33:34.265]  The United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan.
[01:33:34.665 --> 01:33:35.926]  We have to expose this.
[01:33:35.986 --> 01:33:39.109]  They admit that we allowed Pearl Harbor to be bombed.
[01:33:39.469 --> 01:33:42.712]  The United States was at peace with that nation.
[01:33:43.052 --> 01:33:57.584]  This outrageous claim that Roosevelt was this loving pro-American individual, when in truth, he was a communist lover, he sold this country out to socialism, and he killed 3,000 plus of our men and women at Pearl Harbor on purpose.
[01:33:57.624 --> 01:34:00.607]  The attack yesterday on the Hawaiian Islands
[01:34:01.467 --> 01:34:06.492]  This caused severe damage to American naval and military forces.
[01:34:06.812 --> 01:34:12.017]  I want to remind the listeners that we're dealing with our own Pearl Harbors here in America today.
[01:34:12.417 --> 01:34:16.862]  I regret to tell you that very many American lives have been lost.
[01:34:17.402 --> 01:34:20.345]  Hawaii was surprised FDR was not.
[01:34:20.745 --> 01:34:24.589]  I have directed that all measures be taken for our defense.
[01:34:25.029 --> 01:34:27.812]  I'm just talking about the problem, reaction, solution, paradigm.
[01:34:28.132 --> 01:34:48.832]  I ask that the Congress declare that since the unprovoked and dastardly attack by Japan on Sunday, December 7th, 1941, a state of war has existed between the United States
[01:34:49.793 --> 01:35:01.833]  A lot of the evidence of government-sponsored terrorism in the past, from Pearl Harbor to the World Trade Center in 93, Laco to Oklahoma City, are on InfoWars.com.
[01:35:09.614 --> 01:35:11.735]  And it doesn't mean the Empire of Japan wasn't real.
[01:35:11.755 --> 01:35:14.016]  It doesn't mean they didn't commit atrocities in China and Korea.
[01:35:14.036 --> 01:35:17.657]  It doesn't mean they weren't doing terrible things or there weren't baton death marches.
[01:35:17.697 --> 01:35:20.158]  But they knew they let the attack happen.
[01:35:20.498 --> 01:35:21.639]  That was only 3,000 dead.
[01:35:21.699 --> 01:35:26.580]  Now Biden says we're going to go to war with Russia officially with U.S.
[01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:28.001]  troops if you don't give me unlimited money.
[01:35:29.121 --> 01:35:30.282]  He's completely out of his mind.
[01:35:31.362 --> 01:35:32.302]  He's being impeached.
[01:35:32.363 --> 01:35:33.323]  His son's been indicted.
[01:35:35.475 --> 01:35:55.368]  Let's recognize we are in a violent mess, and it is the out-of-control, inbred, crazy, so-called elite we have that are a bunch of corrupt lawyers with BlackRock and these big banks that are just robbing and shutting off the world economy, consolidate power, and creating crises, just like Deepwater Horizon.
[01:35:56.829 --> 01:36:00.272]  It came out in the court, transcripts of the phone calls, the emails.
[01:36:01.735 --> 01:36:06.199]  BP was worth like $45 billion there and they said, well, we're drilling all these deep wells in Gulf of Mexico.
[01:36:06.739 --> 01:36:21.611]  Our executives say in the next month if we just stop having 20 ships a day with concrete show up to dump those in the holes after they drill, we'll save hundreds of millions a day and we'll be a $48 billion company.
[01:36:22.992 --> 01:36:27.795]  And they told the engineers in Houston to do it and they called the engineers on the drilling rigs and said do it.
[01:36:28.276 --> 01:36:30.638]  And all the engineers said, this is mathematics.
[01:36:32.386 --> 01:36:40.733]  The seawater under the pressure is not going to hold those drilling holes down, and the gas and oil is going to come out at pressure.
[01:36:40.813 --> 01:36:42.595]  We're not sure at what level, but it's there.
[01:36:42.935 --> 01:36:44.236]  We're drilling in rich areas.
[01:36:44.256 --> 01:36:47.299]  30, 40,000 foot deep wells, it's going to explode.
[01:36:49.601 --> 01:36:53.484]  And the email's like, we're a $44 billion company.
[01:36:56.126 --> 01:36:58.048]  We're about to be a $48 billion company.
[01:37:02.213 --> 01:37:02.393]  I think?
[01:37:20.882 --> 01:37:21.562]  I was told to do it.
[01:37:22.483 --> 01:37:25.064]  We're going to make four billion dollars not doing it.
[01:37:25.124 --> 01:37:26.604]  We did that for ourselves.
[01:37:46.371 --> 01:37:48.872]  Our executives have decided that mud is no longer needed.
[01:37:49.512 --> 01:37:52.033]  Yes sir, I'm gonna get that done for you right now.
[01:37:54.554 --> 01:38:01.337]  So a year and a half ago, or a year ago, it's December, a year ago, we can't sit in Abrams tanks and F-16s and long-range missiles, that's World War III.
[01:38:01.377 --> 01:38:05.099]  Now like, you know what, it is World War III, dammit, let's get this son of a bitch going.
[01:38:09.292 --> 01:38:12.194]  I'm going to go to your phone calls and we're going to go all the way in the next hour.
[01:38:12.214 --> 01:38:13.676]  So I'll get to every caller on the line.
[01:38:13.856 --> 01:38:19.740]  Alvin, Nathaniel, Bill, JD, Joshua, Cindy, Vidal, Robert, Doug, Rusty.
[01:38:23.283 --> 01:38:24.104]  I guess Vidal hung up.
[01:38:24.204 --> 01:38:25.085]  I was about to go to him.
[01:38:25.645 --> 01:38:32.371]  We're going to go to Doug and others here in just a moment for the balance of the transmission.
[01:38:33.652 --> 01:38:42.316]  But I would be lacking if I did not just say, wow, how crazy is it to be right in the center of the fight for free speech worldwide, not just here?
[01:38:43.116 --> 01:38:46.998]  And have Elon Musk come out and say, all right, well, what does Twitter think?
[01:38:47.018 --> 01:38:47.978]  Should we reinstate Alex Jones?
[01:38:48.038 --> 01:38:49.979]  I mean, yeah, he's not calling for crime.
[01:38:50.940 --> 01:38:53.381]  All the big tech's got Hezbollah on official websites.
[01:38:53.421 --> 01:38:54.761]  Why don't we bring Alex Jones back?
[01:38:55.322 --> 01:39:02.485]  They have all these polls of 80 plus percent, dozens of them, it's always over 80 percent, saying we want Alex Jones back.
[01:39:05.282 --> 01:39:06.904]  Here's Elon Musk after he saw the polls.
[01:39:07.424 --> 01:39:07.925]  Overhead shot.
[01:39:08.445 --> 01:39:10.487]  I guess a lot of people want him unbanned.
[01:39:11.489 --> 01:39:27.906]  They then showed him the testimony of the former head Twitter lawyer with Jack Dorsey with Joe Rogan saying we banned him not for Sandy Hook, they dredged that up later and claimed that's why, but because I was mean to Oliver Darcy of CNN who was running around getting me and others banned.
[01:39:29.133 --> 01:39:29.513]  Breaking!
[01:39:29.553 --> 01:39:33.376]  Musk will consider bringing Alex Jones back on X. Announces imminent poll.
[01:39:33.736 --> 01:39:35.398]  Plans to watch Carlson interview.
[01:39:37.539 --> 01:39:40.421]  And it goes on from there.
[01:39:42.263 --> 01:39:47.987]  Should Twitter offer a general amnesty to suspended accounts provided they have not broken the law or engaged in egregious spam?
[01:39:50.909 --> 01:39:51.790]  And then it goes on.
[01:39:53.331 --> 01:39:53.851]  This poll, 72%.
[01:39:54.672 --> 01:39:56.493]  I hadn't even seen that when I got something printed this morning.
[01:39:56.814 --> 01:39:57.934]  That's the lowest poll I've seen.
[01:39:58.934 --> 01:40:00.254]  I guess Musk actually put one out.
[01:40:00.294 --> 01:40:02.635]  I haven't been paying attention.
[01:40:02.655 --> 01:40:03.736]  Wow, 3,162,000 votes.
[01:40:03.756 --> 01:40:06.136]  See, I had looked at this at 7 a.m.
[01:40:06.176 --> 01:40:06.597]  this morning.
[01:40:06.997 --> 01:40:07.817]  They just printed this off.
[01:40:07.877 --> 01:40:08.617]  I hadn't looked at it.
[01:40:08.957 --> 01:40:09.177]  Oh, okay.
[01:40:09.197 --> 01:40:10.138]  I was saying 80 plus percent.
[01:40:10.158 --> 01:40:15.740]  I guess when they got to the full Twitter community, 3 million plus votes, 72% bring Alex Jones back.
[01:40:15.980 --> 01:40:17.860]  So I didn't know Musk had launched his poll yet.
[01:40:18.721 --> 01:40:20.601]  That's how, see the pants we are around here.
[01:40:23.142 --> 01:40:24.282]  And there's another poll, 88, 86%.
[01:40:34.276 --> 01:40:35.757]  So there's a lot going on here.
[01:40:36.398 --> 01:40:41.161]  The question is, is Oliver Darcy really the former girlfriend of Sane Bankman Freed?
[01:40:41.701 --> 01:40:43.783]  People look at the images and think it may be the same person.
[01:40:43.843 --> 01:40:44.563]  I'm joking.
[01:40:44.583 --> 01:40:50.948]  I'm not actually saying that, but that is fun from Mid-East Mom, Midwest Mom.
[01:40:52.189 --> 01:40:55.011]  But I want to go ahead and go to your phone calls.
[01:40:55.031 --> 01:40:56.352]  I want to see the full
[01:40:57.600 --> 01:41:00.482]  Alex Jones, Tucker Carlson interview, it's everywhere.
[01:41:00.502 --> 01:41:02.864]  I mean, I could have just come in here today and just played the interview.
[01:41:02.884 --> 01:41:05.005]  It's pretty powerful, but we're here taking your calls.
[01:41:05.806 --> 01:41:08.488]  Let's look at some more of the Elon Musk stuff here before I go to your phone calls.
[01:41:08.508 --> 01:41:09.428]  We're going to skip this break, coming up.
[01:41:11.390 --> 01:41:11.750]  Breaking!
[01:41:11.790 --> 01:41:15.713]  Elon Musk considers bringing Alex Jones back to X. Will run poll to the side, I guess.
[01:41:15.993 --> 01:41:17.394]  Hey, can you guys go look at the poll?
[01:41:17.594 --> 01:41:18.955]  I didn't know when you printed that off to me.
[01:41:18.975 --> 01:41:20.796]  30 minutes before the show.
[01:41:22.678 --> 01:41:23.398]  That's kind of big news.
[01:41:23.418 --> 01:41:25.580]  We should probably put an article up on InfoWars.com.
[01:41:25.620 --> 01:41:26.781]  Elon Musk now running poll?
[01:41:28.237 --> 01:41:31.280]  And can I get that?
[01:41:31.460 --> 01:41:32.341]  It's kind of a big deal.
[01:41:32.781 --> 01:41:34.102]  Not mad, you guys are busy.
[01:41:34.222 --> 01:41:36.284]  I didn't notice either, but I'm like not reading it.
[01:41:36.344 --> 01:41:41.089]  It's 3 million plus votes, 70 plus percent say bring Alex Jones back.
[01:41:43.190 --> 01:41:43.651]  Breaking!
[01:41:43.871 --> 01:41:47.414]  Elon Musk says he's bringing Alex Jones back to X. We'll run poll to decide.
[01:41:47.775 --> 01:41:52.239]  Elon says he's ready to poll X users on the reinstatement of Alex Jones.
[01:41:53.609 --> 01:41:56.010]  You know, there's one thing we're blind around this operation.
[01:41:56.050 --> 01:41:56.950]  Myself, it's the worst.
[01:41:57.290 --> 01:42:00.471]  We don't report on ourselves and we don't track what's happening with us.
[01:42:02.272 --> 01:42:03.012]  Hell, I'll go to Twitter.
[01:42:04.152 --> 01:42:04.692]  Where's my phone?
[01:42:04.712 --> 01:42:05.493]  I guess I left it over there.
[01:42:05.913 --> 01:42:07.773]  Can we just please sugar cakes on top?
[01:42:08.594 --> 01:42:10.014]  Can we just go to Elon Musk's Twitter?
[01:42:10.034 --> 01:42:12.615]  Because I just showed you the poll from earlier today.
[01:42:13.455 --> 01:42:14.755]  And can we just show that to people?
[01:42:14.795 --> 01:42:16.896]  Triple, triple cupcakes on top.
[01:42:19.817 --> 01:42:20.737]  That's somebody else's.
[01:42:20.757 --> 01:42:21.918]  All right, I'll go to break.
[01:42:22.518 --> 01:42:22.998]  I'll find it.
[01:42:23.956 --> 01:42:25.077]  That's not the poll.
[01:42:25.137 --> 01:42:26.198]  Here, let me show you the poll.
[01:42:26.619 --> 01:42:27.800]  It's an Elon Musk poll.
[01:42:29.502 --> 01:42:30.103]  Just take it down.
[01:42:30.343 --> 01:42:30.943]  Just take it down.
[01:42:33.967 --> 01:42:34.607]  Here, I'll show you.
[01:42:37.991 --> 01:42:38.972]  His name's Elon Musk.
[01:42:39.973 --> 01:42:44.317]  He bought Twitter, changed the name to X. And it's an Elon.
[01:42:45.399 --> 01:42:45.639]  Right here.
[01:42:46.903 --> 01:42:47.843]  This is Elon Musk.
[01:42:47.963 --> 01:42:48.343]  It's okay.
[01:42:48.383 --> 01:42:50.404]  Let me just show you what I want.
[01:42:50.944 --> 01:42:52.244]  This is what I want right here.
[01:42:52.264 --> 01:42:53.065]  Okay?
[01:42:53.905 --> 01:42:56.186]  It's Elon Musk, at Elon Musk on Twitter.
[01:42:56.226 --> 01:42:56.946]  That's where you go.
[01:42:57.366 --> 01:42:58.326]  He's the guy that owns it.
[01:43:00.907 --> 01:43:04.908]  And then, you go to his Twitter account.
[01:43:06.380 --> 01:43:10.463]  And you pull up the poll that's all over the news that they've launched, and you show it.
[01:43:10.563 --> 01:43:12.984]  Should Twitter offer a general amnesty to suspended accounts?
[01:43:13.304 --> 01:43:13.885]  Probably they have.
[01:43:14.025 --> 01:43:16.546]  And it's got 3 million plus votes.
[01:43:17.227 --> 01:43:21.569]  So he's done the poll, but I was given this 30 minutes before I went on air.
[01:43:21.669 --> 01:43:22.550]  I didn't look at it.
[01:43:22.990 --> 01:43:23.250]  Okay.
[01:43:25.832 --> 01:43:27.133]  Yeah, there's a screenshot of it.
[01:43:27.213 --> 01:43:32.536]  I'd like to get... Oh, it's from November.
[01:43:32.556 --> 01:43:33.537]  That's how I got confused.
[01:43:35.754 --> 01:43:36.794]  I got it, so we haven't done it yet.
[01:43:36.834 --> 01:43:38.896]  No, hey, I'm up here flying by the seat of my pants.
[01:43:39.456 --> 01:43:40.096]  So I misunderstood that.
[01:43:40.136 --> 01:43:40.317]  Okay, good.
[01:43:40.337 --> 01:43:41.237]  So we haven't done the poll yet.
[01:43:41.838 --> 01:43:44.899]  We'll sit there and we'll track that as it unfolds.
[01:43:45.580 --> 01:43:45.900]  All right.
[01:43:47.321 --> 01:43:48.542]  I got a lot of other news here.
[01:43:48.902 --> 01:43:56.047]  Big national news says our IQs have dropped massively, our sperm counts are almost zero, and our life expectancy is plunging.
[01:43:56.087 --> 01:43:58.208]  But there's no depopulation plan going on.
[01:43:58.728 --> 01:43:59.929]  Everything is fine.
[01:44:00.269 --> 01:44:01.350]  Thanks for clarifying that, crew.
[01:44:04.679 --> 01:44:04.939]  All right.
[01:44:06.881 --> 01:44:10.984]  I'm going to take a break here for a minute because I forgot to eat breakfast this morning.
[01:44:11.625 --> 01:44:14.627]  So I got to run out there and eat some yogurt or a couple of strawberries or something.
[01:44:15.328 --> 01:44:23.815]  So I'm getting a little, uh, hangry as they say, but I'll go to your phone calls right after these clips.
[01:44:25.336 --> 01:44:32.542]  Let's play clip six and let's play.
[01:44:36.417 --> 01:44:37.018]  Clip eight.
[01:44:41.262 --> 01:44:42.343]  And let's play clip nine.
[01:44:42.644 --> 01:44:44.005]  And then I'll come right back to your phone calls.
[01:44:44.025 --> 01:44:44.486]  Please stay with us.
[01:44:45.523 --> 01:44:48.945]  And so the earth is being put into a countdown collapse right now.
[01:44:49.406 --> 01:44:52.007]  And so I'm like the fisherman when the tidal wave comes in.
[01:44:52.468 --> 01:44:55.490]  And I'm like, oh my God, my wife and children are about to die.
[01:44:55.510 --> 01:44:59.132]  And so I'm not really worried about me because I'm a man.
[01:44:59.192 --> 01:44:59.672]  I did this.
[01:44:59.752 --> 01:45:00.373]  I knew it was coming.
[01:45:00.393 --> 01:45:01.113]  I've been proven right.
[01:45:01.514 --> 01:45:02.834]  And I'm not happy I was proven right.
[01:45:03.155 --> 01:45:06.076]  I wish we could have gotten ahead of this and stopped it.
[01:45:06.397 --> 01:45:07.798]  Yeah, we have a lot of credibility now.
[01:45:08.138 --> 01:45:09.419]  The people see that we were right.
[01:45:09.579 --> 01:45:11.180]  So maybe we can stop the next phase of it.
[01:45:12.040 --> 01:45:14.062]  But the globalists have gone from testing phase
[01:45:15.199 --> 01:45:17.420]  What do you mean the depopulation?
[01:45:44.341 --> 01:45:46.082]  But I thought we were opposed to genocide.
[01:45:46.142 --> 01:45:46.362]  No?
[01:45:46.823 --> 01:45:47.183]  Or no?
[01:45:47.283 --> 01:45:47.863]  I guess we're not.
[01:45:48.044 --> 01:45:50.685]  Well, you know, we're told now, don't have children as fast as the Earth.
[01:45:51.386 --> 01:45:56.009]  And we're told all this, and Elon Musk is right, and is a hero for pointing out all the actuaries show.
[01:45:56.569 --> 01:46:00.012]  If you don't have 2.1 children, a man and a woman, people go, well a man and a woman can have 2.1.
[01:46:00.252 --> 01:46:02.073]  It's in the aggregate, folks, out of billions.
[01:46:02.754 --> 01:46:10.119]  If a country doesn't have 2.1, 2.2 replacement rate, then you don't have people to take care of the old folks, society collapses.
[01:46:10.919 --> 01:46:14.761]  And so, Japan's 1.3, Italy's 1.3, they're done as cultures.
[01:46:15.762 --> 01:46:19.004]  America, without immigrant influx, is about 1.6.
[01:46:19.784 --> 01:46:21.665]  That's not viable.
[01:46:22.666 --> 01:46:27.969]  And so, and I'm not just talking about white people only here, but white people are 7% of the world population, maybe 8.
[01:46:29.270 --> 01:46:32.773]  And so, I would be sad if the last of the Eskimos were dying.
[01:46:33.293 --> 01:46:37.797]  I'm sad that the Japanese, within a hundred years, there might be 20 million of them.
[01:46:42.830 --> 01:46:48.075]  I mean, I feel a little bit enervated and down just hearing your dot connecting here.
[01:46:48.155 --> 01:46:50.037]  Like, what's the effect on you over 25 years?
[01:46:50.157 --> 01:46:55.763]  I mean, if you literally foresee 9-11 before it happens, and you did, and it can be proven.
[01:46:55.803 --> 01:46:56.403]  We just proved it.
[01:46:56.944 --> 01:46:57.664]  Like, what is that?
[01:46:57.704 --> 01:47:00.827]  What's that like to live with that weird ability?
[01:47:01.408 --> 01:47:02.869]  Well, I mean, I know a specific clip.
[01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:10.341]  I specifically say call the White House, tell them we know they're going to let Al-Qaeda attack us, Bin Laden, and then take our rights.
[01:47:10.401 --> 01:47:11.341]  I say call the White House.
[01:47:11.721 --> 01:47:17.462]  I put the number out, so I put the money where my mouth was, and that's the only time I ever said call the White House and tell them to stop a particular event.
[01:47:18.122 --> 01:47:23.643]  I'm now saying we need to call the White House and say, you've let tens of thousands of military-age men of the Middle East in.
[01:47:24.184 --> 01:47:26.544]  We know a lot of them are Hezbollah and Hamas.
[01:47:26.564 --> 01:47:27.624]  The FBI has confirmed that.
[01:47:28.124 --> 01:47:32.225]  And so, when and if there's big terror attacks, which I believe will probably happen in America,
[01:47:32.745 --> 01:47:36.407]  We're not going to have Homeland Security get more funds and more power and grope us at the airports more.
[01:47:36.908 --> 01:47:42.131]  I want prison time for the agencies and groups that have allowed this.
[01:47:42.251 --> 01:47:45.993]  And I want, I want Biden impeached now.
[01:47:46.533 --> 01:47:46.774]  Okay.
[01:47:47.034 --> 01:47:48.314]  That's why we got rid of McCarthy.
[01:47:48.675 --> 01:47:49.415]  It needs to happen.
[01:47:49.755 --> 01:47:53.458]  Leaving the border open when there is a clear and present danger of this going on.
[01:47:53.718 --> 01:47:57.480]  And when we're very close to war with Iran, we go to war with Iran, they're going to activate Hezbollah.
[01:47:57.560 --> 01:47:57.800]  Okay.
[01:47:58.481 --> 01:48:00.402]  And then that, they make Hamas look like,
[01:48:01.465 --> 01:48:01.665]  I agree.
[01:48:26.544 --> 01:48:33.646]  I don't think people understand something that the mullahs in Iran and the Ayatollah are congratulating Hamas.
[01:48:35.103 --> 01:48:41.886]  that just killed around a thousand or more innocent Israelis, many of them women, children, disabled people, in a vicious evil sneak attack.
[01:48:42.486 --> 01:48:55.352]  They are on there, Hezbollah and Hamas, mainly Hamas, but it's Hezbollah funding it out of Iran, are literally posting videos of them cutting people's heads off and killing children and massacring innocent people.
[01:48:55.812 --> 01:48:59.894]  They're allowed to have their Hezbollah accounts and their Hamas accounts.
[01:49:00.894 --> 01:49:02.755]  The Ayatollah is able to congratulate
[01:49:03.911 --> 01:49:04.571]  What's going on?
[01:49:27.452 --> 01:49:32.553]  I understand that if he did that, the ADL and others would really be able to probably shut down Twitter.
[01:49:32.593 --> 01:49:37.295]  So I understand that he needs to go through a process before he does that.
[01:49:37.795 --> 01:49:40.615]  But the 9-11 thing, I remember that really well.
[01:49:40.795 --> 01:49:42.576]  Nobody was thinking like that.
[01:49:43.116 --> 01:49:45.717]  So you called it in public, on tape.
[01:49:45.777 --> 01:49:50.118]  Did the 9-11 Commission... So if I'm the FBI and I'm investigating 9-11, you're like the first guy I would call.
[01:49:50.138 --> 01:49:52.218]  Because you're the only person who said that out loud.
[01:49:52.518 --> 01:49:53.098]  Did they call you?
[01:49:54.059 --> 01:49:54.559]  No, they didn't.
[01:49:56.312 --> 01:50:19.008]  My most accurate prediction, going back over a decade, was when I read the Rockefeller Foundation Operation Lockstep, and they described using a virus to bring in world government, to bring in a world medical ID, that they would then build a social credit score off of, and that they would make people wear masks for fear, that they would shut down sporting events and things like that, and basically phase in this new tyranny.
[01:50:19.228 --> 01:50:20.809]  So I was also able to specifically
[01:50:22.270 --> 01:50:26.571]  Make that prediction over and over and over again, because I was going off their own battle plans.
[01:50:28.171 --> 01:50:31.012]  Are you the only person in media who actually reads these reports?
[01:50:31.892 --> 01:50:34.253]  I don't think a lot of people do read them, but I do read them.
[01:50:34.333 --> 01:50:39.634]  I mean, I'm currently reading MIT reports from their top councils, Pentagon reports.
[01:50:39.674 --> 01:50:44.275]  They have a working group called the Mad Scientist Group at the Pentagon that works with MIT.
[01:50:44.915 --> 01:50:49.876]  And if you go watch their hour-long, two-hour-long, three-hour-long meetings they have on
[01:50:51.155 --> 01:50:53.155]  YouTube, with all the top scientists.
[01:50:53.215 --> 01:50:54.996]  We're talking hundreds of top scientists.
[01:50:55.656 --> 01:51:09.438]  They admit that they're building a post-human world, that soon everyone's going to be mind-controlled, that they're going to put smart dust in our food, that they can electromagnetically control, and they just lay it all out right there.
[01:51:09.918 --> 01:51:13.339]  And I've learned what these people said in the 50s they would do, were done by the 70s.
[01:51:13.719 --> 01:51:16.680]  What they said their plan was in the 70s, for the 90s, they got done.
[01:51:18.240 --> 01:51:39.985]  And then when they had their Agenda 21 in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, the Big Human Summit, they described everything they would do up until the year 2000, and they got almost all of that done, and now they've got Agenda 2030, and we're going to ban your gas stoves, we're going to ban beef, we're going to ban single-family dwellings, we're going to ban private ownership of cars, and we're going to do all this, and now you see them rolling it all out.
[01:51:40.005 --> 01:51:46.506]  So I'm not really making predictions in these high-level World Economic Forum and other large think tanks.
[01:51:47.126 --> 01:51:51.489]  Groups they are laying out the future and they're they're high priests of the World Economic Forum.
[01:51:51.789 --> 01:51:55.911]  That's a consortium of all these groups You've all know Harari you can read his quotes.
[01:51:56.231 --> 01:51:57.412]  The future is not human.
[01:51:57.732 --> 01:52:01.395]  The human era is over The public is useless.
[01:52:02.015 --> 01:52:06.878]  I mean, this is a very anti-human System, so that's how I'm able
[01:52:08.393 --> 01:52:11.355]  To make predictions because they've given us a roadmap.
[01:52:11.575 --> 01:52:12.816]  They tell us where they want to take us.
[01:52:13.497 --> 01:52:17.280]  And so when the public wakes up, we push back on some of it, but they always come back.
[01:52:17.700 --> 01:52:21.623]  And so I'm just feeling the trajectory of where they said they want to take us.
[01:52:21.703 --> 01:52:32.772]  And there were a lot of white papers, not just the PNAC document from 2000, a year before 9-11, where they described, we really need big terror attacks.
[01:52:33.152 --> 01:52:36.415]  We really need Pearl Harbor events to get Americans to give up their rights.
[01:52:39.648 --> 01:52:42.049]  Alright, the entire next hour will be your calls.
[01:52:42.329 --> 01:52:44.650]  I may even get to one now, but I've got a few other things to hit.
[01:52:45.090 --> 01:52:47.552]  There's so much breaking news at InfoWars.com that I haven't hit.
[01:52:48.392 --> 01:52:50.213]  Like, take this article by Don Salazar.
[01:52:50.513 --> 01:52:53.734]  Video, man sneaks into Bohemian Grove, finds side of bazaar begging ritual.
[01:52:54.355 --> 01:53:00.357]  And I'm not lessening what this guy did, but I feel like I should make a public service announcement about this.
[01:53:01.798 --> 01:53:05.860]  The Secret Service and all the rest of them are there in the second half of July.
[01:53:07.202 --> 01:53:10.183]  So there's no one there during the rest of the year.
[01:53:10.223 --> 01:53:11.084]  There's still security.
[01:53:11.104 --> 01:53:12.024]  You can still get arrested.
[01:53:12.784 --> 01:53:15.085]  But people say, well, where are they doing it?
[01:53:15.105 --> 01:53:15.886]  They show up at the Idol.
[01:53:15.906 --> 01:53:16.486]  There's no one there.
[01:53:16.806 --> 01:53:19.327]  It's because they're there in the last two weeks of July.
[01:53:20.888 --> 01:53:22.909]  Well, that footage that's coming up, though, it's still amazing.
[01:53:23.329 --> 01:53:26.290]  He goes inside the Idol, shows the sacrificial area.
[01:53:26.310 --> 01:53:27.290]  I mean, it's amazing.
[01:53:27.310 --> 01:53:29.711]  So I'm not lessening what the guy did.
[01:53:29.731 --> 01:53:30.652]  I just want people to know.
[01:53:32.228 --> 01:53:35.333]  No one's ever snuck in and got out but us, and I wish others have been successful.
[01:53:35.394 --> 01:53:36.536]  It's not about me saying I'm number one.
[01:53:36.576 --> 01:53:36.856]  I'm not.
[01:53:36.916 --> 01:53:37.958]  God, prominence.
[01:53:40.903 --> 01:53:41.424]  You do not.
[01:53:44.574 --> 01:53:47.576]  Go in there when they're actually there, unless you think you're gonna get arrested.
[01:53:47.616 --> 01:53:48.776]  I'm just saying, know that.
[01:53:48.836 --> 01:53:51.818]  It's still dangerous to go in, so kudos to the guy to be able to get this out.
[01:53:51.858 --> 01:53:52.479]  It's journalism.
[01:53:52.539 --> 01:53:52.839]  It's good.
[01:53:52.879 --> 01:53:53.399]  I support it.
[01:53:53.839 --> 01:53:59.923]  I just want to warn people, you go in there in July, because they're there a few weeks before the elites show up, you're gonna have a big problem.
[01:53:59.963 --> 01:54:01.924]  I mean, Prince Charles goes there, everybody.
[01:54:02.304 --> 01:54:03.945]  So it's very dangerous when they're actually there.
[01:54:04.946 --> 01:54:09.568]  Still a great coup to get that done.
[01:54:10.509 --> 01:54:12.490]  Please support the broadcast for your new viewer.
[01:54:14.144 --> 01:54:15.485]  I've got my second major book out.

[01:55:13.279 --> 01:55:16.541]  I want to thank all those that did do that, DefendJones.com.
[01:55:16.821 --> 01:55:18.622]  But I wanted to go to one of the crew members, Thomas.
[01:55:20.265 --> 01:55:26.168]  Cause he popped in my ear about 30 minutes ago and said, Hey, I've, I've had experiences where I haven't seen somebody in 10 years.
[01:55:26.788 --> 01:55:31.071]  Well, he can tell the story and I have a dream about him.
[01:55:31.771 --> 01:55:32.831]  And then I see him the next day.
[01:55:33.112 --> 01:55:39.295]  We all have those experiences and that shows you there's a lot more than what we just perceive and see visually.
[01:55:40.220 --> 01:55:41.661]  And that's where God comes in.
[01:55:41.681 --> 01:55:44.023]  That's where such amazing things happen.
[01:55:44.043 --> 01:55:45.163]  And the establishment knows that.
[01:55:45.504 --> 01:55:48.526]  They don't want you to know that's there so you're all alone and think they're God.
[01:55:48.566 --> 01:55:49.126]  They're not God.
[01:55:49.366 --> 01:55:50.727]  So, Thomas, tell us your story.
[01:55:51.588 --> 01:55:52.148]  Yes, Alex.
[01:55:54.296 --> 01:55:59.057]  When I was in high school, I had a very close friend of mine who was a phenomenal musician.
[01:55:59.737 --> 01:56:06.419]  His father actually built amps for Dave Navarro, so he was trained very well and got me into playing music.
[01:56:07.479 --> 01:56:12.361]  But he did have some problems with addiction, so he was kind of in and out of my life.
[01:56:12.401 --> 01:56:17.522]  He'd go away to rehab and get in trouble, and then he'd clean his act up.
[01:56:18.022 --> 01:56:21.583]  So there was a point where maybe I haven't heard from him for about a year and a half.
[01:56:22.703 --> 01:56:32.109]  And then I had a dream of him and I dreamt of him and the actual exact angle and place that I would run into him is where I saw him the next day.
[01:56:32.129 --> 01:56:35.191]  And it was just so bizarre and I think it's because...
[01:56:36.517 --> 01:56:54.048]  When you have certain connections with people, or like with your story, that house that you referenced with the golf course, things that you have these personal connections with, they kind of expand into, you know, almost like another dimension.
[01:56:54.088 --> 01:56:57.290]  It's a deep connection with certain things, so God can reveal
[01:56:58.411 --> 01:57:04.854]  Uh, certain things to you ahead of time, and I think that's what was happening in my dream, because I was just thinking, hey, when's the next time I'm gonna see this guy?
[01:57:04.874 --> 01:57:06.215]  I'd love to play guitar with him.
[01:57:06.815 --> 01:57:08.516]  And, you know, it was an answered prayer.
[01:57:08.536 --> 01:57:15.399]  I got a heads up and said, hey, you're about to see this guy, so... And the key is, it wasn't just a coincidence.
[01:57:15.659 --> 01:57:17.920]  Then you saw him at the exact place, the same thing.
[01:57:17.940 --> 01:57:18.080]  Exactly.
[01:57:18.100 --> 01:57:19.280]  That you saw in the dream, yeah.
[01:57:19.460 --> 01:57:19.680]  Yeah.
[01:57:19.760 --> 01:57:21.581]  And with me, God didn't go, see, I'm real.
[01:57:21.641 --> 01:57:22.021]  You see that?
[01:57:22.041 --> 01:57:23.082]  I did that just so you'd see that.
[01:57:24.024 --> 01:57:33.911]  And sometimes it can be a bit scary when you have a dream, maybe like a nightmare, and it's so nightmarish that you're like, oh my God, is this what I'm seeing?
[01:57:33.951 --> 01:57:35.532]  Hold on, don't go off.
[01:57:35.932 --> 01:57:39.135]  I'll come back to you to finish up, and I promise, we're taking every call on the board.
[01:57:39.555 --> 01:57:42.377]  Doug's up front, coming back, hour number three.
[01:57:42.437 --> 01:57:43.858]  Thomas, stay right there, I want to finish this story.
[01:57:49.244 --> 01:57:52.725]  Never forget that the answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:57:54.106 --> 01:57:58.328]  We've come a long way in the fight against tyranny, and it's been listeners and viewers like you that have kept us on air.
[01:57:58.348 --> 01:58:08.292]  That's why we bring you the very best products, so you love them, so you enjoy them, as you come back and get them again and again, so we can stay on the air in the fight against the globalists, because it's viewers like you that keep this operation on air.
[01:58:08.732 --> 01:58:09.333]  And here we are.

[01:58:49.178 --> 01:58:54.001]  Please listen closely because this is life-changing critical information.
[01:58:54.601 --> 01:59:04.447]  The globalists are bombarding us with toxic chemicals hitting us in the air, the water, the food, the 5G, the poison shots, the shedding.
[01:59:05.447 --> 01:59:05.907]  I think so.
[01:59:28.975 --> 01:59:33.138]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[02:00:08.857 --> 02:00:11.860]  We're born into this fantastic universal consciousness.
[02:00:12.201 --> 02:00:14.984]  Able to interface with the eternal and God.
[02:00:16.245 --> 02:00:19.969]  When really these stupid politicians with their big marble buildings trying to act powerful, they're a joke.
[02:00:20.890 --> 02:00:22.371]  Reach out to God, God will touch you.
[02:00:23.432 --> 02:00:23.933]  God's real.
[02:00:25.014 --> 02:00:26.516]  And I have a lot of these dreams that have come true.
[02:00:27.196 --> 02:00:31.221]  Dreams I even wrote down, you know, dreams that were amazing.
[02:00:33.143 --> 02:00:34.503]  And some were good, some were bad.
[02:00:34.544 --> 02:00:42.786]  I mean, I've told the story many times, and we'll go back to Thomas to finish the story, about I looked older than I was, and I wasn't a drug guy, but I was an alcohol guy.
[02:00:43.626 --> 02:00:51.928]  And so even the 16-year-olds, when I was like 14, you know, they were my friends, but they'd come get me because I would go into a liquor store, and for whatever reason, they would sell liquor to me and not to them.
[02:00:52.868 --> 02:00:56.029]  And so we drive into Dallas, because there weren't even liquor stores where I lived.
[02:00:56.049 --> 02:00:57.450]  It was a dry county outside Dallas.
[02:00:57.910 --> 02:01:00.171]  We drive in the county right next to Dallas, into Dallas.
[02:01:00.871 --> 02:01:02.171]  We drive into the worst neighborhood.
[02:01:02.471 --> 02:01:03.832]  I probably did this a hundred times or more.
[02:01:04.672 --> 02:01:06.453]  And, you know, your kid, she don't have a lot of money.
[02:01:06.493 --> 02:01:10.714]  She wanted to Everclear and Milwaukee's Best or whatever for a party, you know, high school girls or whatever.
[02:01:11.814 --> 02:01:21.658]  And I had a dream that I woke up all sweaty from where I'm getting beer and a guy comes out, pulls a knife on me and whatever, and he has a purple
[02:01:23.084 --> 02:01:24.745]  And, uh, polo shirt.
[02:01:25.426 --> 02:01:26.526]  It was a white crackhead.
[02:01:27.587 --> 02:01:29.588]  A purple and green striped polo shirt.
[02:01:31.289 --> 02:01:35.712]  And I remember, in the dream, I was like, in an alley behind a building and I had the mirror.
[02:01:35.732 --> 02:01:38.014]  For whatever reason, we'd pulled in behind it.
[02:01:39.335 --> 02:01:42.237]  And sure enough, I walk around, the guy tries to mug me, it happens.
[02:01:42.977 --> 02:01:43.818]  I defend myself.
[02:01:43.838 --> 02:01:51.443]  And I think it was God warning me, so when I saw the guy was ready, and was able to not have him, you know, stab me, and was able to get out of there,
[02:01:52.605 --> 02:01:53.065]  We're good to go.
[02:02:09.021 --> 02:02:18.529]  Yes, so I was saying that sometimes you'll have dreams that are nightmarish, that seem so real, and you don't want to think, hey, this is our future, this is what's happening.
[02:02:18.569 --> 02:02:27.896]  But I think maybe God is showing you a possibility that can happen if you're not, like you said, aware and have situational awareness.
[02:02:27.916 --> 02:02:35.482]  Like, I've had dreams of submarines showing up on the coast of the United States and launching missiles into buildings.
[02:02:35.522 --> 02:02:37.023]  I don't want that to happen, God forbid.
[02:02:38.024 --> 02:02:48.913]  I think it's like a subconscious collective fear that we're being invaded, and we could have an invasion like that with such weak leadership in our country.
[02:02:50.575 --> 02:03:01.003]  But I also have dreams of passed away loved ones that come and visit me, and I have vivid, in-depth conversations with them, and they're giving me instructions in life on how to
[02:03:02.128 --> 02:03:11.020]  You know, carry on and carry on legacies and it's just so profound and I, you know, just give it all up to God that we're able to have that kind of extrasensory perception.
[02:03:11.060 --> 02:03:12.562]  Exactly, I didn't talk about those.
[02:03:12.662 --> 02:03:13.884]  I had those as well.
[02:03:14.670 --> 02:03:34.444]  So it's very cool, and you know, the whole Matrix thing with the cat, I think that is, you know, it's a big symbol for something that a lot of people experience, that kind of deja vu feeling, you know, that you're supposed to take something from that moment, like, hey, I've seen this before, so there's a lot to it.
[02:03:35.526 --> 02:03:36.026]  Powerful.
[02:03:36.226 --> 02:03:37.787]  Thank you so much for talking about that.
[02:03:38.187 --> 02:03:40.629]  Yeah, and so everybody out there is like, yeah, I've had this experience.
[02:03:40.689 --> 02:03:44.071]  So it's infinite, ladies and gentlemen, and time is on a line.
[02:03:44.111 --> 02:03:47.452]  It's a loop or a figure eight, and it's all interconnected.
[02:03:47.492 --> 02:03:48.073]  It's incredible.
[02:03:48.093 --> 02:03:50.734]  And we're here and it's just beyond amazing.
[02:03:51.074 --> 02:03:51.715]  We're going to break.
[02:03:51.795 --> 02:03:56.357]  I'm going to come back and I'm going to just bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.
[02:03:57.018 --> 02:03:57.738]  Take your call.
[02:03:57.798 --> 02:03:59.459]  So, Doug, get ready.
[02:04:00.219 --> 02:04:01.420]  Rusty, get ready.
[02:04:02.240 --> 02:04:03.281]  Robert, get ready.
[02:04:05.410 --> 02:04:06.971]  Joshua, everybody, get ready.
[02:04:07.391 --> 02:04:07.991]  We're going to go to break.
[02:04:08.011 --> 02:04:12.153]  We'll be back in 60 seconds and go directly to your phone calls.
[02:04:13.093 --> 02:04:14.694]  But Satan is not God.
[02:04:16.435 --> 02:04:21.877]  Satan is here to test us, and Satan has already been defeated by Jesus Christ and God's sacrifice.
[02:04:22.617 --> 02:04:23.838]  You think about, oh, what a story.
[02:04:23.858 --> 02:04:27.600]  God sits down his son and says, God isn't going to ask us anything God isn't going to do.
[02:04:28.460 --> 02:04:31.381]  God is perfect and honest and fair.
[02:04:31.861 --> 02:04:33.002]  Isn't that perfectly fair?
[02:04:34.619 --> 02:04:35.019]  Think about it.
[02:04:35.920 --> 02:04:36.461]  God's real.
[02:04:37.502 --> 02:04:38.363]  Isn't that powerful?
[02:04:38.443 --> 02:04:39.183]  God made you.
[02:04:39.223 --> 02:04:39.984]  Look at the universe.
[02:04:40.444 --> 02:04:41.706]  Oh, you're just a blob of cells.
[02:04:41.786 --> 02:04:42.506]  Oh, yeah.
[02:04:43.948 --> 02:04:49.573]  Three billion years ago, you were some salts in the ocean that just got together and just made all this BS.
[02:04:49.633 --> 02:04:50.634]  You know it's not true.
[02:04:51.695 --> 02:04:52.776]  We're not even from here, folks.
[02:04:52.796 --> 02:04:53.317]  We were put here.
[02:04:54.698 --> 02:04:55.278]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:55.298 --> 02:04:55.659]  Stay with us.
[02:04:59.076 --> 02:05:08.200]  What would you do if there was a tyrannical totalitarian world government taking over whose plan was to kill 90% of the world population and they were already beginning to do it?
[02:05:08.680 --> 02:05:09.580]  You would rally against it?
[02:05:09.600 --> 02:05:10.120]  You would fight it?
[02:05:10.500 --> 02:05:11.861]  And that's what we're doing.
[02:05:12.321 --> 02:05:13.442]  This is the reality of 2023.
[02:05:14.662 --> 02:05:17.665]  I just want to thank listeners and viewers for your last year's support.
[02:05:17.986 --> 02:05:28.938]  I want to encourage you now more than ever to spread the word about the broadcast, to pray for the broadcast, to take clips and share it from the broadcast, and to buy products that enrich your life at InfoWarsaw.com.

[02:06:08.577 --> 02:06:09.557]  Dialing in to the universe.
[02:06:09.577 --> 02:06:13.680]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:06:13.860 --> 02:06:15.141]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:15.461 --> 02:06:17.243]  Dialing in to eternity.
[02:06:21.016 --> 02:06:29.283]  And what we do in this life projects the pattern of the future levels we're about to travel, and the adventures, my friends.
[02:06:29.603 --> 02:06:36.149]  Your eye has not seen, your ear has not heard, your mouth has not tasted, but God has in store for us.
[02:06:36.589 --> 02:06:42.794]  The Bible says that, but I've been shown the third heaven.
[02:06:45.236 --> 02:06:46.117]  The 12th dimension.
[02:06:47.893 --> 02:06:52.686]  I could not even tell you what I saw, because there's no words to describe it.
[02:06:53.208 --> 02:06:55.935]  But God is real, and the angels were there.
[02:07:12.233 --> 02:07:16.314]  All right, let's go to your phone calls, as promised.
[02:07:16.334 --> 02:07:17.734]  Appreciate you holding.
[02:07:17.854 --> 02:07:20.194]  Doug in Florida, you're on the air.
[02:07:20.214 --> 02:07:20.894]  Thank you so much.
[02:07:22.335 --> 02:07:23.635]  Hey, thanks for taking my call.
[02:07:24.435 --> 02:07:35.577]  For a new listener, first-time caller, and just listening to you over the past two weeks, you've really helped me turn around my perspective and really get some more hope and optimism moving forward.
[02:07:36.598 --> 02:07:37.658]  Real quick, can I explain?
[02:07:38.218 --> 02:07:38.478]  Yes, sir.
[02:07:40.791 --> 02:07:45.354]  Up until seven years ago, I was a hardcore leftist living in California with my wife.
[02:07:45.834 --> 02:08:04.286]  Trump starts running and I start watching some YouTube podcasters and realize that Marxism is a load of crap and they tear it apart, realize MAGA is right, I'm a conservative, to the chagrin of my wife and who comes around and then three years ago she suggests we move to Florida.
[02:08:04.486 --> 02:08:05.027]  I'm all in.
[02:08:05.652 --> 02:08:18.828]  And even though I'm a member of the John Birch Society, over the past three years I've just been really depressed, disgusted about the political process, and then hearing you, after all the persecution you're undertaking, and after
[02:08:19.554 --> 02:08:30.678]  All the truths you've been revealing, you point towards, we need to elect people who actually represent us, to hold these people accountable, to bring them to justice, and let the guilty swing.
[02:08:31.019 --> 02:08:32.339]  That's where you're pointing?
[02:08:32.619 --> 02:08:34.440]  No wonder they're coming after you, Alex.
[02:08:34.800 --> 02:08:37.161]  That message really resonated with me.
[02:08:37.861 --> 02:08:40.842]  Because anything other than that, I don't want to think about.
[02:08:41.002 --> 02:08:42.223]  It would be horrible.
[02:08:42.808 --> 02:08:45.771]  So it's really given me hope that that's what we need to do.
[02:08:46.511 --> 02:08:52.517]  I'm doubling down because if that's your, your pointing that way, I know I need to go that way.
[02:08:52.837 --> 02:08:55.479]  And we really need to get things together to make that happen.
[02:08:55.659 --> 02:08:55.980]  I agree.
[02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:56.881]  Just to be clear.
[02:08:58.072 --> 02:09:00.094]  People say if voting changed anything it would be illegal.
[02:09:00.414 --> 02:09:00.594]  No.
[02:09:01.134 --> 02:09:02.315]  They are stealing elections.
[02:09:02.355 --> 02:09:03.396]  We have to overpower them.
[02:09:03.416 --> 02:09:04.897]  We don't give up because they're cheating.
[02:09:05.338 --> 02:09:09.100]  We double down and show the cheating which blows up in their face even bigger.
[02:09:09.121 --> 02:09:12.123]  You see, they want to dominate us and bully us and have us give up.
[02:09:12.203 --> 02:09:12.443]  No.
[02:09:12.923 --> 02:09:13.524]  We don't give up.
[02:09:13.564 --> 02:09:16.006]  We just get stronger and we're going to win this.
[02:09:18.728 --> 02:09:21.310]  Yeah, I mean, that's what we got to do.
[02:09:22.324 --> 02:09:25.605]  I mean, it doesn't say that I'm not, you know, preparing for the just-in-case.
[02:09:25.706 --> 02:09:35.010]  I've got plenty of lead and food and money and silver and all that, but... Well, listen, listen, when you say just-in-case, the collapse is going to happen, whether it's a year from now or five or ten.
[02:09:36.201 --> 02:09:41.724]  We're going to go through world government, Antichrist, Mark of the Beast, drones around everywhere, but mass death.
[02:09:42.165 --> 02:09:51.670]  But then more people are going to join us once they get this, and it's going to be a total circus, because the globalists think they have us in checkmate, because they're going to have the resources cut off so it doesn't matter.
[02:09:52.031 --> 02:09:54.312]  They believe we're all going to eat each other, the angrier world.
[02:09:55.293 --> 02:09:56.393]  And a lot of people are going to die.
[02:09:56.874 --> 02:09:59.695]  But out of that, we're going to rediscover who we are and become even stronger.
[02:09:59.715 --> 02:10:00.336]  I appreciate your call.
[02:10:01.577 --> 02:10:03.098]  Let's be 100% clear, folks.
[02:10:03.559 --> 02:10:08.082]  Everyone listening to me, you're not going to get out of this.
[02:10:08.943 --> 02:10:09.483]  You get that?
[02:10:09.583 --> 02:10:10.804]  You're going to face Satan.
[02:10:14.347 --> 02:10:15.007]  It's how it is.
[02:10:15.928 --> 02:10:17.189]  It's going down, folks.
[02:10:17.529 --> 02:10:19.410]  So just get ready.
[02:10:20.391 --> 02:10:21.432]  But we're going to come through it.
[02:10:22.898 --> 02:10:25.320]  And a lot of us are going to be dead, but our spirit goes on.
[02:10:25.400 --> 02:10:26.280]  It's real, folks.
[02:10:26.641 --> 02:10:28.042]  It's a decision you make right now.
[02:10:28.322 --> 02:10:29.142]  God's testing you.
[02:10:29.442 --> 02:10:31.184]  It's an incredible test, man.
[02:10:31.504 --> 02:10:38.369]  You wake up in a world with the stars and the moon and the birds and the bees and the families and all the world, all this incredible crap.
[02:10:38.629 --> 02:10:40.390]  People are like, oh, there's nothing made this, there's nothing.
[02:10:40.750 --> 02:10:47.595]  No, folks, it's all been put here as a war game before you go to the next level.
[02:10:49.070 --> 02:10:54.613]  You're not going to be given the incredible power you're about to get, next level, without a test, folks.
[02:10:54.653 --> 02:10:56.394]  And let me tell you a little secret here.
[02:10:57.755 --> 02:11:07.099]  It's not a secret, but what they teach in the mainline Christian church is, you go to heaven, skip the break coming up, we'll get all the calls, and you float around in a cloud and play a harp.
[02:11:08.180 --> 02:11:08.880]  No, sir.
[02:11:10.421 --> 02:11:10.981]  What happened?
[02:11:11.642 --> 02:11:14.243]  Satan took one third of the angels, rebelled against God.
[02:11:14.623 --> 02:11:15.644]  That's what's going on.
[02:11:17.881 --> 02:11:19.163]  And that's just in this sector.
[02:11:19.784 --> 02:11:25.792]  Christ said, I have many flocks in Israel, in Judea.
[02:11:26.393 --> 02:11:26.894]  What do you mean?
[02:11:27.635 --> 02:11:29.197]  This ain't the only rodeo, folks.
[02:11:29.237 --> 02:11:29.678]  I've seen it.
[02:11:29.718 --> 02:11:30.119]  I've been there.
[02:11:31.420 --> 02:11:32.863]  This is not the only rodeo.
[02:11:34.488 --> 02:11:37.830]  And basically, Hollywood shows you this, but creates an archetype.
[02:11:37.850 --> 02:11:46.074]  Oh, we'll have world government, and all this unity, and the Starfleet with the UN symbol, and you're going to get, there's going to be this utopia, and you're in Starfleet, and all this stuff.
[02:11:46.374 --> 02:11:47.735]  Oh, you're going to be in Starfleet, all right.
[02:11:48.736 --> 02:11:53.558]  But the point is, is that you're going to, you're going to go up to heaven.
[02:11:54.018 --> 02:11:57.480]  You can always go for R&R, and be with God, and just be in total bliss.
[02:11:57.901 --> 02:11:59.261]  But God knows you're not going to do that.
[02:11:59.281 --> 02:12:02.463]  You're going to sign up for the next mission.
[02:12:05.936 --> 02:12:07.938]  And that's all I'm trying to explain to you.
[02:12:08.018 --> 02:12:17.145]  That is, this is a test, ladies and gentlemen, before we go in and save a lot of spirits, a lot of entities, a lot of creatures.
[02:12:18.346 --> 02:12:23.671]  We're being recruited to go to the next level in a long-term intergalactic war.
[02:12:24.512 --> 02:12:26.233]  And I've read this in a book.
[02:12:26.313 --> 02:12:27.774]  I've been there.
[02:12:27.814 --> 02:12:28.575]  I've been shown it.
[02:12:30.437 --> 02:12:32.999]  And it's beyond even this dimension.
[02:12:34.182 --> 02:12:35.143]  It's heavy.
[02:12:35.303 --> 02:12:36.943]  This is just boot camp, folks.
[02:12:37.384 --> 02:12:39.204]  This is level one, baby.
[02:12:40.085 --> 02:12:41.045]  Level one.
[02:12:41.865 --> 02:12:43.626]  We're on level one.
[02:12:46.107 --> 02:12:48.008]  Let's go to Rusty in Colorado.
[02:12:48.048 --> 02:12:48.809]  Rusty, you're on the air.
[02:12:48.829 --> 02:12:49.229]  Go ahead.
[02:12:49.249 --> 02:12:52.790]  Happy 1776 to you, sir.
[02:12:53.671 --> 02:12:53.991]  Yes, sir.
[02:12:54.011 --> 02:12:54.331]  Go ahead.
[02:12:54.351 --> 02:13:01.034]  Okay, so I'm a Community Notes contributor, and I want to go over a few things four ways.
[02:13:01.054 --> 02:13:03.275]  You're talking about Twitter, so describe what that means and go ahead.
[02:13:04.800 --> 02:13:20.908]  Community Notes is the New Age fact check system that Twitter uses to disseminate so-called disinformation and add context to somewhat informative information.
[02:13:22.029 --> 02:13:25.811]  So, there's four ways to avoid getting a Community Note.
[02:13:25.851 --> 02:13:27.952]  The first one is advertising.
[02:13:28.513 --> 02:13:33.356]  Advertisements are very hard to put a community note on, especially if you have good reviews.
[02:13:33.636 --> 02:13:47.323]  So if you can hear my voice, go to an InfoWars store site that you can leave a review on, any of them, and leave good reviews, because that gives good contributors ammunition to fight the bad actors inside the system.
[02:13:48.363 --> 02:13:55.266]  The second way to avoid a community note is to post memes as satire.
[02:13:55.287 --> 02:13:57.608]  Satire is very hard to
[02:13:59.369 --> 02:14:00.730]  Place a community note on it.
[02:14:00.750 --> 02:14:04.531]  That's right, AI has big trouble, and even humans do, categorizing it.
[02:14:04.591 --> 02:14:06.492]  Yes, the joke, the jester is king.
[02:14:07.752 --> 02:14:12.234]  Oh yeah, and it's a great way to frame a real discussion in a humorous way.
[02:14:12.494 --> 02:14:23.898]  So, there's actually an option inside, for me as a community note contributor, if I see something that has a pending note that is satire, I just click satire, no note needed.
[02:14:24.378 --> 02:14:25.018]  Bam, done.
[02:14:25.778 --> 02:14:27.419]  So, the third way would be
[02:14:28.001 --> 02:14:31.164]  Frame your discussion in the form of an opinion, okay?
[02:14:33.105 --> 02:14:37.749]  Same thing, there's a way for me to say, oh, that's an opinion, no note needed.
[02:14:37.809 --> 02:14:51.540]  If I say, guy's purple today, and some other bad actor inside the system says, no, no, it's actually blue, well, I said, at the front end of my comment, I said, no, this is my opinion, I'm not stating facts.
[02:14:52.261 --> 02:14:55.823]  So, it makes it very, very difficult to put a community note on that.
[02:14:57.679 --> 02:15:06.764]  Finally, you want to use...you want to form your post in the way of a question, right?
[02:15:06.804 --> 02:15:12.547]  You could say, oh, I think this...these reviews from this water filter are great or whatever.
[02:15:13.027 --> 02:15:14.428]  Do you agree with me?
[02:15:15.049 --> 02:15:20.091]  It's impossible to put a community note on a question.
[02:15:20.492 --> 02:15:24.754]  There's a big section in the rules for community note providers to say.
[02:15:25.470 --> 02:15:30.891]  If you want to answer a question, you need to go into the comments, right?
[02:15:30.911 --> 02:15:37.373]  So nearly all, 90% more, more than that, of questions get turned down for community notes.
[02:15:39.773 --> 02:15:42.634]  And for those that don't know, community notes is a great revolutionary thing.
[02:15:43.034 --> 02:15:48.035]  You don't censor things, you just let people then make comments about it, and that creates its own debate.
[02:15:49.616 --> 02:15:54.397]  Yes, sir, and if you do happen to get a community note that falls into one of those four categories,
[02:15:54.758 --> 02:15:55.619]  You can contest it.
[02:15:55.639 --> 02:15:56.760]  There's a way to contest it.
[02:15:58.562 --> 02:16:12.234]  Finally, after close to a year, in early November, where I'm cutting this ad, we finally got one of our flagship products back in stock, Ultra 12, the highest quality vitamin B12 organic.
[02:16:12.815 --> 02:16:16.758]  You take it under the tongue, so you get better absorption of the body through your blood vessel.
[02:16:18.180 --> 02:16:20.742]  He said that he's going to turn community notes on you.
[02:16:21.192 --> 02:16:34.702]  So, if you can hear my voice right now, if you've been on Twitter for six months, if you have an account that's verified with a phone number, and you have no strikes against your account, you need to apply to CommunityNotes.
[02:16:34.742 --> 02:16:36.984]  Because we need like-minded people in there.
[02:16:37.684 --> 02:16:42.347]  The CommunityNotes about four months ago got overwhelmed with leftist shill.
[02:16:42.548 --> 02:16:44.549]  Because they're control freaks, absolutely.
[02:16:44.569 --> 02:16:46.370]  How do people sign up for CommunityNotes?
[02:16:46.390 --> 02:16:48.412]  You gotta be six months, and you go apply for it.
[02:16:49.614 --> 02:16:57.518]  You need to be at least six month old account to verify your account with a phone number, a valid phone number.
[02:16:57.918 --> 02:17:00.640]  And you also have to have no strikes against your account.
[02:17:01.080 --> 02:17:02.200]  So make sure you're not a bot.
[02:17:02.341 --> 02:17:02.581]  All right.
[02:17:02.621 --> 02:17:03.581]  Incredible call, Rusty.
[02:17:03.621 --> 02:17:04.081]  Thank you.
[02:17:05.502 --> 02:17:06.262]  I welcome Elon.
[02:17:06.283 --> 02:17:07.543]  Put me back on Twitter if he wants.
[02:17:08.183 --> 02:17:11.105]  And give me community notes.
[02:17:11.145 --> 02:17:11.525]  I love it.
[02:17:13.126 --> 02:17:15.507]  My first post is going to be the sky's blue.
[02:17:15.527 --> 02:17:16.568]  They'll probably fact check that.
[02:17:17.509 --> 02:17:18.309]  Obviously, you're right.
[02:17:18.389 --> 02:17:20.190]  The sky's blue at high noon on a clear day.
[02:17:21.050 --> 02:17:22.991]  Let's go ahead, because you can always say something's a lie.
[02:17:23.011 --> 02:17:24.012]  That's the games they play.
[02:17:24.552 --> 02:17:25.572]  Bill in Iowa.
[02:17:25.592 --> 02:17:26.333]  Bill, you're on the air.
[02:17:26.373 --> 02:17:26.693]  Welcome.
[02:17:28.093 --> 02:17:28.473]  Good evening.
[02:17:28.513 --> 02:17:30.394]  Good afternoon, Mr. Jones.
[02:17:30.414 --> 02:17:32.055]  I've got to say, 1776, brother.
[02:17:32.075 --> 02:17:35.316]  Hey, real quick about that Tucker Carlson interview.
[02:17:35.716 --> 02:17:37.117]  Smashed it out of the park.
[02:17:37.557 --> 02:17:40.458]  It's going to be the beginning of our new 1776.
[02:17:41.759 --> 02:17:46.441]  You know, and I also saw Rameshwami yesterday, and I turned him on to a bottle of X2.
[02:17:47.620 --> 02:17:52.762]  I think I owe you an apology for calling you a tin head all these years.
[02:17:53.302 --> 02:17:53.642]  Yeah, I know.
[02:18:18.090 --> 02:18:18.991]  It's coming, brother.
[02:18:19.011 --> 02:18:20.792]  I just want to say keep up the good fight.
[02:18:21.493 --> 02:18:22.233]  I love you, man.
[02:18:23.074 --> 02:18:23.814]  That's all I got to say.
[02:18:23.834 --> 02:18:27.176]  Well, I love you too, but would you say the Worms turning or winning?
[02:18:27.256 --> 02:18:30.258]  Are we beginning to win or where are we?
[02:18:30.278 --> 02:18:31.159]  Oh, the tide's turning.
[02:18:31.739 --> 02:18:38.384]  And also, I asked a very important question for Ramaswamy yesterday that you totally forgot about.
[02:18:39.265 --> 02:18:43.988]  I asked him after the debate, did he actually go out and get Chris Christie a Happy Meal?
[02:18:44.048 --> 02:18:46.910]  And if he did, was it a boy toy or a girl toy?
[02:18:48.490 --> 02:18:50.131]  Thank you so much.
[02:18:50.191 --> 02:18:51.211]  Appreciate that, brother.
[02:18:51.251 --> 02:18:51.591]  Love you.
[02:18:52.012 --> 02:18:52.512]  Love you, too.
[02:18:52.952 --> 02:18:53.292]  J.D.
[02:18:53.312 --> 02:18:54.853]  in Indiana, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:18:54.873 --> 02:18:55.173]  Go ahead.
[02:18:56.574 --> 02:18:57.214]  Hello, Alex.
[02:18:57.774 --> 02:18:58.555]  Long-time listener.
[02:18:58.575 --> 02:19:00.575]  Good to have you here.
[02:19:00.615 --> 02:19:01.356]  First-time caller.
[02:19:01.716 --> 02:19:02.216]  Thank you.
[02:19:03.137 --> 02:19:12.301]  I just want to start off with what, I mean, first of all, I'm seeing a lot of things that you're reporting on every day that I'm at work.
[02:19:12.881 --> 02:19:17.343]  It's, you know, different people having strokes every week, and they're just like,
[02:19:18.211 --> 02:19:19.412]  Getting used to it, I guess.
[02:19:19.572 --> 02:19:19.952]  I don't know.
[02:19:20.452 --> 02:19:29.076]  But on the sort of what's coming down, I have to say we have to protect the children at all costs.
[02:19:29.296 --> 02:19:44.663]  I believe that's the number one target of the New World Order because, you know, erasing us, you know, that's not going to help because we've got young kids coming up that are patriotic.
[02:19:44.743 --> 02:19:47.044]  And I believe they're going to be the most patriotic
[02:19:47.816 --> 02:19:49.020]  generation we've ever had.
[02:19:56.502 --> 02:20:01.966]  Different leaders, you know, the Jewish tyrant Herod went after the firstborn Jews because he wanted to get Jesus.
[02:20:02.527 --> 02:20:05.129]  And we saw that with Moses, which is in the hieroglyphs.
[02:20:05.569 --> 02:20:06.850]  People usually say, oh, that's in the Old Testament.
[02:20:06.890 --> 02:20:17.579]  And then they dug up the pyramids and it's like, Rameses I ordered all firstborn Jews killed because they knew from their satanic sources that there was going to be deliverers in them.
[02:20:17.899 --> 02:20:20.961]  And I agree, they want to abort and kill our children because they fear them.
[02:20:20.981 --> 02:20:22.923]  They know the deliverers are in there.
[02:20:24.426 --> 02:20:34.030]  My children, I am taking them and they are practicing bowhunting and they are doing the things that I did not do as a child because I didn't think this way.
[02:20:34.431 --> 02:20:40.113]  They know more now than what I ever even thought about when I was their age.
[02:20:40.753 --> 02:20:42.574]  So they are going to be stronger.
[02:20:42.634 --> 02:20:51.998]  They're going to be the people that truly, I believe, free us because they know so much more than what I did when I was their age.
[02:20:54.225 --> 02:20:54.785]  Young people around me.
[02:20:54.805 --> 02:20:57.006]  I'm in a business where there are some young people and I'm in and out but
[02:21:19.594 --> 02:21:20.135]  They know.
[02:21:20.355 --> 02:21:22.157]  They know so much, and they're 20.
[02:21:22.598 --> 02:21:28.224]  I mean, uh, and I just really believe in... Look, my six-and-a-half-year-old daughter has been protected for all this knowledge.
[02:21:28.725 --> 02:21:30.908]  She already knows and talks to me like a 40-year-old woman.
[02:21:31.707 --> 02:21:34.289]  And she actually gets, I mean, it's like, it's like frightening.
[02:21:34.609 --> 02:21:35.490]  It's like, wow.
[02:21:35.630 --> 02:21:38.692]  The most important thing you can teach them is to question everything.
[02:21:39.133 --> 02:21:47.559]  When the news comes on in my house, which is very rarely because we don't watch mainstream, they're just like, oh, the liars are on and they change it.
[02:21:47.579 --> 02:21:48.019]  Well, that's right.
[02:21:48.059 --> 02:21:52.062]  The left said, don't teach your children any values because they want to teach them their satanic values.
[02:21:52.102 --> 02:21:55.145]  If you simply don't even tell children what to believe, just say, hey,
[02:21:55.825 --> 02:21:56.866]  These people are lying.
[02:21:56.926 --> 02:21:57.846]  Catch it for yourself.
[02:21:58.227 --> 02:21:59.207]  They are off and running.
[02:21:59.247 --> 02:22:02.029]  They want to be led and then empowered.
[02:22:02.069 --> 02:22:02.730]  You're absolutely right.
[02:22:02.750 --> 02:22:04.130]  Beautiful, beautiful testimony.
[02:22:04.151 --> 02:22:04.571]  Anything else?
[02:22:05.431 --> 02:22:07.693]  And read the Bible with your children.
[02:22:07.813 --> 02:22:08.874]  Question everything.
[02:22:09.194 --> 02:22:10.735]  Don't scare them, but just
[02:22:11.320 --> 02:22:13.942]  Put it in them that they are American.
[02:22:14.042 --> 02:22:22.387]  I'll tell you what's wild, my six and a half year old daughter, I'm saying with my son, my only son, I have three daughters, she just begs to have the Bible read to her.
[02:22:23.148 --> 02:22:27.651]  We didn't even tell her it's like powerful or that, you know, she just wants to hear it.
[02:22:28.131 --> 02:22:30.573]  Thank you so much for the call, she just knows, it's amazing.
[02:22:30.593 --> 02:22:32.374]  They're really, turns toward God.
[02:22:32.414 --> 02:22:35.216]  They're already pre, like a satellite dish, they're already aimed, folks.
[02:22:35.876 --> 02:22:36.797]  Ready for the transmission.
[02:22:37.137 --> 02:22:38.078]  We're gonna give it to them.
[02:22:40.642 --> 02:22:54.112]  Hey Alex, first off I just want to say I wish I was a part of your generation so badly, especially after listening to you, which by the way was before episode 911 on Joe Rogan.
[02:22:56.412 --> 02:23:01.376]  I just want to say I felt the same way about $12.55 and $1.55 you did, but he didn't seem to feel that way.
[02:23:01.436 --> 02:23:02.737]  I don't know if it was a thing or not.
[02:23:02.757 --> 02:23:05.339]  I don't know if you even remember that, but how are you doing?
[02:23:05.379 --> 02:23:07.321]  No, what specifically happened on Joe Rogan?
[02:23:07.581 --> 02:23:09.343]  I know the episode you're talking about, what was said?
[02:23:11.345 --> 02:23:11.665]  Which one?
[02:23:11.685 --> 02:23:11.665]  $9.11, $12.55?
[02:23:12.165 --> 02:23:13.447]  No, what are you saying?
[02:23:13.887 --> 02:23:16.930]  I'm not getting the gist of what you're saying.
[02:23:16.950 --> 02:23:19.312]  Oh, you said, I see that you had me on $9.11, $12.55, and $1.55.
[02:23:22.350 --> 02:23:23.930]  And you were like, is that a coincidence?
[02:23:23.991 --> 02:23:25.911]  And he goes, no, just so happened to be the 155.
[02:23:25.991 --> 02:23:28.612]  And you're like, oh, I don't know.
[02:23:28.652 --> 02:23:28.932]  The 1555.
[02:23:29.712 --> 02:23:30.012]  Sorry.
[02:23:30.032 --> 02:23:33.073]  No, I remember that now.
[02:23:33.173 --> 02:23:34.053]  I remember that now.
[02:23:34.133 --> 02:23:36.114]  Man, I've been following you.
[02:23:36.214 --> 02:23:40.095]  First off, everything you say is real and everyone knows that.
[02:23:40.215 --> 02:23:42.356]  But I originally was calling in.
[02:23:42.456 --> 02:23:46.257]  I wanted to say that you and Tucker Carlson together.
[02:23:46.277 --> 02:23:48.577]  I mean, it's just it's better than bread and butter.
[02:23:48.597 --> 02:23:50.318]  It's probably bread and bread and garlic butter.
[02:23:51.021 --> 02:24:02.190]  When you talk, you balance each other out so, so just significantly and eloquently in a way where you combat each other sometimes, but you're both down to earth and you can see the respect and love for each other.
[02:24:02.230 --> 02:24:07.474]  So I just want to say for anyone who hasn't heard them, you got to take a listen to Tucker and Alex.
[02:24:07.554 --> 02:24:09.956]  Well, people always ask, is Tucker really that happy?
[02:24:11.017 --> 02:24:12.177]  It's even more so in person.
[02:24:12.678 --> 02:24:14.559]  The guy I saw, he's like Santa Claus.
[02:24:14.579 --> 02:24:16.441]  I mean, he's just like in such a good mood.
[02:24:17.549 --> 02:24:22.232]  I was going to say, everything you said about him seems totally true, even after he got off Fox.
[02:24:22.252 --> 02:24:24.234]  Because I've been watching him since when he was on Fox.
[02:24:24.894 --> 02:24:27.676]  And after he got off Fox, he kind of did let loose.
[02:24:27.736 --> 02:24:31.939]  And you could see his more genuine, goofy side, and his laugh, and more and all.
[02:24:32.459 --> 02:24:33.360]  You could see it's real.
[02:24:33.460 --> 02:24:35.281]  I agree with you entirely in that aspect.
[02:24:36.702 --> 02:24:37.763]  In that aspect entirely.
[02:24:37.943 --> 02:24:44.968]  As far as World War III, I just want to say, you know, it's time for not only the global elites,
[02:24:45.467 --> 02:25:00.137]  But everyone in the world to just start to view our entire world as more of a global society, as opposed to just a global economy, because sure, economy has things to do with society, but a society and a culture matters.
[02:25:00.538 --> 02:25:03.299]  And there's individual cultures and societies that matter.
[02:25:03.820 --> 02:25:05.361]  But ultimately, we're all human.
[02:25:05.541 --> 02:25:11.085]  And if we all came together in the humanity aspect, things would come together in the other aspects.
[02:25:11.727 --> 02:25:13.527]  And it would gradually, gradually grow.
[02:25:13.727 --> 02:25:26.351]  And looking at it from a 30,000 point stand view, everyone feels that way deep down, whether it comes to their egos engulfing parts of their bodies and beings that disrespect the ultimate goal in life.
[02:25:27.031 --> 02:25:34.132]  Whatever it is, everyone sees it as some pet particle inside of their bodies, and if we could just reach that and tap into it somehow.
[02:25:34.392 --> 02:25:37.633]  I have some ideas, truthfully, but... Tell us!
[02:25:39.594 --> 02:25:40.114]  Roger that!
[02:25:41.539 --> 02:25:56.330]  Well, I developed kind of a business plan for some of the global elites in order to sort of not lose money and kind of create a way to still make money while not destroying everyone else in their path beneath them.
[02:25:56.350 --> 02:25:57.891]  That would be a long topic.
[02:25:58.472 --> 02:25:59.072]  Other than that,
[02:26:00.757 --> 02:26:01.237]  I think so.
[02:26:22.651 --> 02:26:23.272]  We're good to go.
[02:26:42.850 --> 02:26:45.511]  Alright, I don't want to cut these callers short, so we're going to go to break.
[02:26:45.531 --> 02:26:50.412]  I'm back with Cindy, and Alvin, and Nathan, and Joshua, and Jack, and Lewis, and everybody else here.
[02:26:51.272 --> 02:26:52.432]  And then Jay Dyer's taking over.
[02:26:53.132 --> 02:26:56.793]  But, here's a couple things I want to hit right now before we go to break.
[02:26:56.973 --> 02:26:57.714]  Look at this headline.
[02:26:58.854 --> 02:27:00.034]  It's on InfoWars.com.
[02:27:01.774 --> 02:27:04.135]  It's like the CDC Director video and statements.
[02:27:05.775 --> 02:27:06.496]  Here we go again.
[02:27:07.476 --> 02:27:11.937]  CDC Director tells public to take COVID vaccines social distance.
[02:27:12.961 --> 02:27:13.702]  And wear a mask.
[02:27:14.682 --> 02:27:15.503]  So here we go again.
[02:27:15.523 --> 02:27:19.906]  CDC director tells public to take COVID vaccines, social distance, and wear a mask.
[02:27:19.986 --> 02:27:20.266]  Boom!
[02:27:21.827 --> 02:27:24.509]  Now, we got ahead of it in August, so they backed off.
[02:27:24.529 --> 02:27:25.009]  And I predicted.
[02:27:25.029 --> 02:27:26.930]  I said, they're going to come back again in a few months.
[02:27:26.970 --> 02:27:27.431]  And they did it.
[02:27:27.511 --> 02:27:28.952]  So I didn't make that up.
[02:27:29.072 --> 02:27:29.692]  It's on record.
[02:27:29.732 --> 02:27:30.172]  You've seen it.
[02:27:30.212 --> 02:27:31.053]  It's happening everywhere.
[02:27:31.393 --> 02:27:31.673]  Boom.
[02:27:31.814 --> 02:27:32.294]  There it is.
[02:27:32.354 --> 02:27:32.574]  Okay.
[02:27:33.034 --> 02:27:34.135]  But it's not about being right.
[02:27:34.175 --> 02:27:35.356]  It's about getting ahead of it now.
[02:27:35.676 --> 02:27:36.877]  We know they're trying it and saying no.
[02:27:37.898 --> 02:27:38.278]  Look at this.
[02:27:40.049 --> 02:27:40.549]  I gotta go to break.
[02:27:40.589 --> 02:27:41.710]  I'll hit this one, come back and go to your calls.
[02:27:42.210 --> 02:27:43.890]  Alex Jones might be making a comeback.
[02:27:44.090 --> 02:27:45.671]  Am I making a comeback?
[02:27:46.251 --> 02:27:46.531]  Hmm.
[02:27:47.952 --> 02:27:48.632]  That's Newsweek.
[02:27:49.092 --> 02:27:50.452]  We'll hit that when we come back.
[02:27:50.492 --> 02:27:52.213]  And then Tucker Carlson and Alex Jones crack up.
[02:27:52.233 --> 02:27:56.354]  We're calling prank phone call to ex-CNN host Brian Stelter.
[02:27:56.414 --> 02:27:57.635]  We did prank call him.
[02:27:58.035 --> 02:27:58.955]  We did video it.
[02:28:00.015 --> 02:28:02.016]  And I've decided to release it next week.
[02:28:03.368 --> 02:28:05.631]  And I did make a joke to Brian.
[02:28:05.671 --> 02:28:06.512]  I said, I want to marry him.
[02:28:07.634 --> 02:28:08.995]  And Brian was very excited, actually.
[02:28:09.015 --> 02:28:10.517]  I mean, I'm serious.
[02:28:11.679 --> 02:28:13.862]  So I was joking, folks.
[02:28:14.262 --> 02:28:15.564]  I don't want to marry Brian Stalter.
[02:28:16.991 --> 02:28:17.892]  We had a few drinks.
[02:28:17.952 --> 02:28:18.913]  Tucker wasn't drinking.
[02:28:18.973 --> 02:28:19.753]  We had some steaks.
[02:28:19.794 --> 02:28:20.834]  The rest of the crew was drinking.
[02:28:22.016 --> 02:28:26.079]  He goes, let's go down to the river, you know, the dark, with flashlights.
[02:28:26.740 --> 02:28:28.381]  And I go, hey, Brian Stelter keeps calling me.
[02:28:28.401 --> 02:28:29.402]  And I said, well, let's call him.
[02:28:29.462 --> 02:28:30.523]  So we called him.
[02:28:30.944 --> 02:28:31.824]  And I had a few drinks.
[02:28:31.884 --> 02:28:33.946]  So I had a little bit of fun.
[02:28:34.046 --> 02:28:34.707]  It's pretty stupid.
[02:28:35.788 --> 02:28:38.070]  But hey, we should invite Brian Stelter on the air.
[02:28:39.031 --> 02:28:41.273]  Hey, Brian, you were a big star, not on your show, but on mine.
[02:28:42.898 --> 02:28:43.838]  Look for that next week.
[02:28:43.879 --> 02:28:45.799]  It's going to be really hilarious.
[02:28:45.819 --> 02:28:48.521]  Like a seven-minute phone call with Brian Stelter.
[02:28:48.921 --> 02:28:49.441]  We'll be right back.
[02:28:49.461 --> 02:28:49.902]  Stay with us.

[02:30:57.927 --> 02:31:04.429]  One of the most frustrating things about being awake to the globalist agenda is seeing the general public still asleep.
[02:31:04.649 --> 02:31:18.654]  By and large, not aware of the magnitude of the incredible danger they're under, but also the ongoing attacks and the magnitude of the death caused by the lethal injections, masqueradings, vaccines.
[02:31:18.814 --> 02:31:23.716]  It is so frustrating to see people going about their daily lives oblivious,
[02:31:25.123 --> 02:31:27.801]  And he realized entrance is not bliss, it equals death.
[02:31:29.462 --> 02:31:49.894]  But people are starting to really understand how serious things are, and that's a hard thing to do, because to wake up to a dystopic reality and realize that we're in the middle of a giant biological weapons war against humanity, and that there's mass sterilization that's already taking place, and they're cutting off all the major energy sources, is really hard to deal with, but it's the reality.
[02:31:50.455 --> 02:31:54.637]  Facing it is our only chance to turn this around, because stuff's about to get really, really nasty.

[02:34:00.195 --> 02:34:01.256]  And then you're in a cage.
[02:34:01.696 --> 02:34:02.097]  Yeah!
[02:34:07.096 --> 02:34:08.556]  We're gonna break out of this prison planet.
[02:34:08.576 --> 02:34:10.257]  We're going interstellar.
[02:34:10.317 --> 02:34:11.377]  Nobody's gonna stop us.
[02:34:12.037 --> 02:34:13.178]  We got God on our side.
[02:34:13.558 --> 02:34:15.418]  We were put here as a launch pad, baby.
[02:34:15.458 --> 02:34:16.159]  I can tell ya.
[02:34:16.959 --> 02:34:18.339]  I've been up there with the high command.
[02:34:18.419 --> 02:34:18.919]  I've seen it.
[02:34:19.280 --> 02:34:19.860]  It's real.
[02:34:20.100 --> 02:34:20.980]  Get ready, folks.
[02:34:21.080 --> 02:34:22.100]  Join us now.
[02:34:23.821 --> 02:34:27.162]  Sign up to go to faraway, incredible locations.
[02:34:28.522 --> 02:34:30.063]  Like the one you're on right now.
[02:34:30.083 --> 02:34:32.043]  Could it be any cooler?
[02:34:33.144 --> 02:34:33.824]  And dangerous?
[02:34:34.813 --> 02:34:35.613]  Unreal as hell.
[02:34:36.854 --> 02:34:39.495]  You meet a woman, you're passionate, you marry a children.
[02:34:40.535 --> 02:34:41.656]  A merger of you and her.
[02:34:41.676 --> 02:34:43.716]  I mean, it just gets cooler by the second.
[02:34:43.736 --> 02:34:45.617]  It's all fantastic.
[02:34:47.058 --> 02:34:50.839]  But they tell you, oh, my new Netflix show, you know, hasn't come out.
[02:34:50.859 --> 02:34:51.599]  I'm depressed.
[02:34:51.739 --> 02:34:52.920]  World's so boring.
[02:34:54.440 --> 02:34:56.761]  You ain't open your eyes up and ain't open your soul up.
[02:34:57.222 --> 02:35:00.404]  Alright, I want to go back to your phone calls, but I've just got to hit this article because it's funny.
[02:35:01.364 --> 02:35:03.005]  And you know, I've been talking to a lot of people.
[02:35:03.686 --> 02:35:11.110]  I probably had three people today and three or four yesterday and a bunch in the last week say, Jones used to be funny.
[02:35:12.851 --> 02:35:16.113]  You've gotten so serious over the years that it's a bummer.
[02:35:16.153 --> 02:35:17.274]  Can you be funny again?
[02:35:17.294 --> 02:35:20.596]  The crew was telling me that last week when I was doing the English accent for like an hour straight.
[02:35:22.369 --> 02:35:26.872]  And so yes, I'm going to try to be more funny here.
[02:35:28.393 --> 02:35:31.736]  So we're going to dredge up old funny things we've done, but also do new funny things.
[02:35:32.356 --> 02:35:33.297]  So we have Fartgate.
[02:35:34.217 --> 02:35:38.140]  Before Jay Dyer takes over, after I take your calls, you want it, you got it.
[02:35:38.240 --> 02:35:39.721]  It's a major scandal, Fartgate.
[02:35:40.582 --> 02:35:45.665]  It doesn't just end or start with John Kerry blasting off at the COP28 event.
[02:35:45.805 --> 02:35:46.886]  Oh, it gets more serious.
[02:35:47.587 --> 02:35:51.670]  The answer is putting a giant fart bag on him like they do on the cows in Canada.
[02:35:52.623 --> 02:35:55.485]  In fact, I demand John Kerry not just fly on private jets.
[02:35:55.965 --> 02:35:56.745]  He should stop that.
[02:35:57.165 --> 02:36:03.249]  He should put a giant methane bag on his back because he's got a big fart problem.
[02:36:03.909 --> 02:36:06.010]  I know that already happened a few days ago, but I was thinking about this morning.
[02:36:06.030 --> 02:36:07.691]  I'm like, you're so serious.
[02:36:07.711 --> 02:36:08.671]  You didn't even play this.
[02:36:10.092 --> 02:36:13.054]  You don't have any Republicans literally on real foot.
[02:36:13.094 --> 02:36:14.514]  They admit this is real.
[02:36:16.956 --> 02:36:19.157]  He's like, we've got to stop cows and methane.
[02:36:20.802 --> 02:36:27.969]  I mean, it's like you couldn't come up with comedy this good, but they take themselves so serious, the unintentional comedy is just platinum.
[02:36:28.429 --> 02:36:29.090]  Triple diamond.
[02:36:30.551 --> 02:36:31.392]  Alright, let's stop right there.
[02:36:32.352 --> 02:36:34.594]  I have a tendency to say coming up and then hit it all right now.
[02:36:36.796 --> 02:36:38.178]  You've heard of Falcon Heavies, man.
[02:36:38.198 --> 02:36:39.959]  This guy almost took off, he farted so hard.
[02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:42.522]  So, Mr. Botox.
[02:36:44.603 --> 02:36:45.985]  Mr. Frankenstein.
[02:36:47.978 --> 02:36:52.220]  So, continuing here, ladies and gentlemen, there's a Newsweek article and a bunch of others.
[02:36:52.860 --> 02:36:54.681]  Alex Jones might be making a comeback.
[02:36:56.921 --> 02:36:58.122]  Well, let me explain something.
[02:36:58.202 --> 02:37:04.024]  As soon as the audience, when I got the platform and attacked in the last six years, decided to stand with us, we made our comeback.
[02:37:04.064 --> 02:37:04.904]  We never went away.
[02:37:06.105 --> 02:37:14.648]  We became more influential, which you one-dimensional thinkers that serve El Diablo can't seem to get your heads out of your butts and figure out.
[02:37:15.748 --> 02:37:17.049]  So, I love this statement.
[02:37:18.504 --> 02:37:20.865]  Is Alex Jones making a comeback?
[02:37:22.145 --> 02:37:23.686]  And the answer is no.
[02:37:24.486 --> 02:37:27.247]  We already made a comeback because we never went away.
[02:37:29.027 --> 02:37:33.049]  You guys declare victory and you don't even have a victory.
[02:37:34.449 --> 02:37:37.470]  So you just keep thinking you dictate reality like you're God.
[02:37:37.590 --> 02:37:38.410]  You're not God.
[02:37:38.430 --> 02:37:42.411]  And Infowars never went away.
[02:37:42.451 --> 02:37:43.832]  We were put through the fire.
[02:37:45.046 --> 02:37:48.288]  And only because of God acting through the audience of activists are we still here.
[02:37:49.449 --> 02:37:50.889]  So, pretty ridiculous.
[02:37:51.950 --> 02:37:58.174]  And like I said, next week Tucker Carlson, Alex Jones, crank call Brian Stelter.
[02:37:58.314 --> 02:37:58.974]  It's true.
[02:38:00.415 --> 02:38:01.135]  It's true.
[02:38:02.116 --> 02:38:03.137]  It's ridiculous.
[02:38:04.137 --> 02:38:05.038]  It's hilarious.
[02:38:06.004 --> 02:38:08.106]  You'll hear it next week if we're still on the air.
[02:38:08.126 --> 02:38:10.948]  I don't take any... I'm on the left to declare victory.
[02:38:11.248 --> 02:38:17.373]  I think we're starting to turn the tide, but I'm not about to declare victory because there's always a new challenge.
[02:38:19.094 --> 02:38:24.659]  The universe would be stagnant if God did not do that, and I just really agree with God.
[02:38:24.719 --> 02:38:28.802]  I don't even pretend to be the judge of God.
[02:38:29.062 --> 02:38:34.247]  I just agree with whatever the big kahuna says at yes sir.
[02:38:35.564 --> 02:38:37.765]  I'm 100% on board whatever you say."
[02:38:38.825 --> 02:38:45.388]  And God goes, then, incredible justice and freedom and beauty and love and family and eternal life and everything's badass and awesome, but you gotta fight evil.
[02:38:46.088 --> 02:38:47.529]  I'm like, wow, that sounds like a great deal.
[02:38:47.569 --> 02:38:48.329]  Thank you for consciousness.
[02:38:48.569 --> 02:38:49.250]  Thanks for making me.
[02:38:49.290 --> 02:38:52.711]  It really is great to exist and great to have all this power and freedom.
[02:38:52.771 --> 02:38:54.092]  Wow, thank you very much for that.
[02:38:54.112 --> 02:38:57.293]  I'm gonna go against that?
[02:38:57.313 --> 02:38:59.914]  I'm gonna get on my belly in front of it.
[02:39:03.220 --> 02:39:12.148]  And then God says, yes, you've been given beyond nirvana, total completion in my presence, but now I ask you to choose, will you leave my presence to fight evil?
[02:39:13.129 --> 02:39:15.651]  And that's the next level, and you have to leave God's presence.
[02:39:15.671 --> 02:39:17.533]  You're still getting beam information.
[02:39:17.573 --> 02:39:19.594]  God's still there like a warm fire to your back.
[02:39:20.255 --> 02:39:27.962]  But the storm, the freezing cold of evil is pouring in on you, and God's going to tie you to a rope and lower you down into hell to do work.
[02:39:29.753 --> 02:39:33.536]  Yeah, folks, there isn't a Candy Land after this.
[02:39:35.238 --> 02:39:43.786]  But you already know it's all real and have full, complete interface with God and consciousness and you will be begging to be put in enemy's face.
[02:39:44.146 --> 02:39:46.168]  You'll be begging to be dumped into the operations.
[02:39:46.188 --> 02:39:50.212]  You'll be begging to fight anti-life.
[02:39:51.499 --> 02:39:54.222]  And you're going to spread life throughout this dimension and others.
[02:39:54.242 --> 02:39:56.124]  You're going to do things you can't even imagine.
[02:39:56.164 --> 02:40:00.348]  You're going to be building entire galaxies, universes.
[02:40:00.868 --> 02:40:02.190]  It's unlimited, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:40:02.210 --> 02:40:03.271]  You're engineers.
[02:40:03.331 --> 02:40:04.612]  You're master builders.
[02:40:06.074 --> 02:40:08.116]  You're the architects.
[02:40:08.176 --> 02:40:12.500]  The Luciferians call Satan the great architect because God's called the great architect.
[02:40:12.540 --> 02:40:15.443]  No, they're not the architect of anything but failure.
[02:40:18.029 --> 02:40:19.189]  You want to work for the great architect?
[02:40:19.609 --> 02:40:21.330]  Get in league with God right now.
[02:40:22.630 --> 02:40:24.251]  And all God's offering is the truth.
[02:40:25.451 --> 02:40:26.511]  And it is amazing.
[02:40:26.832 --> 02:40:27.552]  I'm going to stop preaching.
[02:40:27.832 --> 02:40:28.332]  Oh my gosh.
[02:40:33.654 --> 02:40:34.074]  Alright.
[02:40:37.035 --> 02:40:41.616]  Fire all of your guns at once and explode into space.
[02:40:43.066 --> 02:40:43.526]  Skip the break.
[02:40:43.546 --> 02:40:44.827]  I'm going to take all these calls.
[02:40:44.847 --> 02:40:45.888]  I'm going to stop preaching.
[02:40:46.028 --> 02:40:48.909]  Cindy in South Carolina, you're on the air.
[02:40:50.851 --> 02:40:52.952]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:40:53.852 --> 02:41:01.137]  I'm going to, I guess, represent the potential atheists or people that have a different faith or non-faith.
[02:41:01.757 --> 02:41:06.740]  But I've, for whatever reason, maybe the Tucker Carlson thing last night, but I was told
[02:41:08.263 --> 02:41:12.206]  I was told by a friend today is the day to call, and after three years, I finally got through.
[02:41:12.226 --> 02:41:15.108]  I have a story that I should have told three years ago.
[02:41:15.128 --> 02:41:22.434]  In November of 2019, I have a friend who is a private chef, a very high-end private chef out of Charleston.
[02:41:22.774 --> 02:41:25.336]  This person gets hired by politicians and royalty.
[02:41:25.716 --> 02:41:34.263]  This person was employed at that time in the Netherlands, feeding a large contingency of people who are politicians and royalty, including their children.
[02:41:34.283 --> 02:41:36.965]  And at that time, at that event, it was at night.
[02:41:38.416 --> 02:41:42.718]  They were offered a shot and they believed it to be a flu shot initially, but it wasn't.
[02:41:43.319 --> 02:41:47.961]  As the night went on, everybody was being inoculated with a virus that was to come.
[02:41:48.622 --> 02:41:51.223]  An unnamed virus that was not the flu.
[02:41:51.623 --> 02:41:54.685]  And I've known that I should have told that story for whatever reason.
[02:41:54.725 --> 02:41:58.967]  Maybe it'll result in someone else telling a story, but that's my story and that's the end of it.
[02:41:59.087 --> 02:42:01.249]  Well, I mean, you sound credible.
[02:42:01.469 --> 02:42:02.569]  I don't know what you're saying is true.
[02:42:02.589 --> 02:42:06.552]  I'm not saying you're lying, but it came out in the London Guardian about 15 years ago.
[02:42:07.472 --> 02:42:08.112]  We're good to go.
[02:42:31.952 --> 02:42:33.313]  Anthony Hopkins, he got caught.
[02:42:33.333 --> 02:42:33.993]  It was totally fake.
[02:42:34.514 --> 02:42:36.014]  So yeah, that's the thing.
[02:42:36.054 --> 02:42:38.196]  You're in the club, you get taken care of.
[02:42:39.396 --> 02:42:42.058]  What else did they say about this?
[02:42:43.479 --> 02:42:43.979]  That was it.
[02:42:44.239 --> 02:42:45.880]  It went on for hours.
[02:42:45.920 --> 02:42:55.085]  It was a huge amount of people, including children, and they were offered it and declined because it seemed like a wise thing to decline.
[02:42:56.226 --> 02:42:57.387]  And that was it.
[02:42:57.407 --> 02:43:01.649]  It happened in November at a huge event, a private event.
[02:43:02.113 --> 02:43:04.454]  Well, you say, Cindy, you don't believe in God.
[02:43:04.474 --> 02:43:06.335]  You've never been touched by God, Cindy?
[02:43:27.523 --> 02:43:35.230]  Not like that you might traditionally say, but I just knew I was supposed to, you know, today was the day I got through to tell you this story and I'm going to go because it's crazy.
[02:43:35.390 --> 02:43:36.190]  No, don't go, Cindy.
[02:43:36.210 --> 02:43:36.851]  Let me ask you a question.
[02:43:37.411 --> 02:43:43.016]  Have you ever been outdoors at night by yourself and the stars are out and just looked up there and felt that feeling of timelessness?
[02:43:43.056 --> 02:43:43.737]  Have you ever felt that?
[02:43:44.777 --> 02:43:45.378]  Yeah, of course.
[02:43:46.175 --> 02:43:49.978]  Well, Cindy, God's real, but God is about free will, not some fake church.
[02:43:50.359 --> 02:43:51.560]  I don't blame you for rejecting the church.
[02:43:51.600 --> 02:43:52.701]  It's there to make you reject it.
[02:43:53.542 --> 02:43:55.443]  And so I understand rejecting the establishment.
[02:43:55.664 --> 02:43:56.524]  That's the system.
[02:43:56.905 --> 02:43:57.605]  That's the priesthood.
[02:43:57.645 --> 02:43:58.887]  But God's real.
[02:43:58.967 --> 02:44:05.332]  If you will just pray privately or with me right now for God to touch you and ask God to come into your life and show you things,
[02:44:06.053 --> 02:44:09.356]  In my experience, God will show you things to show you how God's real.
[02:44:09.676 --> 02:44:16.322]  You might get a visit by an actual angel, or you might, you know, be told, walk outside, there's about to be a car wreck.
[02:44:16.342 --> 02:44:17.584]  You walk out, there's a huge car wreck.
[02:44:17.604 --> 02:44:18.625]  That's the kind of stuff God does.
[02:44:19.365 --> 02:44:20.686]  Would you like to know if that's real?
[02:44:22.808 --> 02:44:24.029]  I respect that, but...
[02:44:26.035 --> 02:44:26.716]  But there's a block.
[02:44:26.756 --> 02:44:28.077]  Hold on, hold on, Cindy.
[02:44:28.337 --> 02:44:29.358]  There's a block there, though.
[02:44:29.698 --> 02:44:31.039]  I'm saying, what do you have to lose?
[02:44:31.079 --> 02:44:33.901]  See, God will not do this if you don't ask for it.
[02:44:33.981 --> 02:44:37.284]  You have to say, I have free will, governance over my soul.
[02:44:37.744 --> 02:44:40.186]  I'm asking God to show God to me.
[02:44:40.627 --> 02:44:41.868]  You don't want to see if that's real.
[02:44:43.973 --> 02:44:51.297]  That's a hard... That's a big... For somebody that was scared enough to tell this story... What do you... Well, you know there's evil out there.
[02:44:51.317 --> 02:44:54.258]  I'm asking you, what do you have to lose if it's all a made-up thing?
[02:44:54.999 --> 02:44:59.701]  Just... Why would you be... Why would you not want to say, God of your real, show me?
[02:45:01.782 --> 02:45:02.943]  Alright, I'll think about it.
[02:45:05.188 --> 02:45:06.990]  See, deep down, you know what's on the other side.
[02:45:07.030 --> 02:45:08.091]  This is very real, Cindy.
[02:45:08.591 --> 02:45:09.652]  This is the real universe.
[02:45:10.233 --> 02:45:24.345]  You have to say, if you want to go beyond the stars, beyond everything you see that's already so fantastical, this is just nothing compared to it, you have to say, show me, I want you to show me, because God isn't like the devil that attacks you without permission.
[02:45:25.546 --> 02:45:29.250]  God wants you to open the door and just say,
[02:45:30.593 --> 02:45:31.254]  I'm open to anything.
[02:45:31.274 --> 02:45:33.295]  I just hope that you're open to those of us that aren't.
[02:45:56.440 --> 02:46:03.744]  That we know, we understand truth when we hear it, but we may not feel the same way faith-wise as a lot of your followers.
[02:46:03.764 --> 02:46:06.205]  But I'm not asking you about me or my followers.
[02:46:06.945 --> 02:46:17.971]  If there's powers greater than us in the universe, and God is the omnipresent creator, which I am postulating, why would you be scared to say, God, if you're real, show yourself to me?
[02:46:17.991 --> 02:46:21.352]  I don't know if I'm scared.
[02:46:21.473 --> 02:46:24.234]  I think it's just something I've got to do in private and think about.
[02:46:24.878 --> 02:46:44.731]  I think you should, but this is a big journey, this is a big step, and I want you to experience it, and I know that if you simply say, God the Creator, the God of life, show me, God will show you.
[02:46:45.872 --> 02:46:50.235]  You will see it, and then you'll have to make a choice on whether you want to reject the Holy Spirit.
[02:46:51.624 --> 02:46:52.765]  I know there's a bigger power.
[02:46:52.865 --> 02:46:53.566]  I know that.
[02:46:53.666 --> 02:46:54.706]  That's all I'm sure of.
[02:46:55.087 --> 02:46:56.087]  But I don't know what it is.
[02:46:56.228 --> 02:47:01.291]  But that higher power... Well, no one can... We're fine now.
[02:47:01.351 --> 02:47:05.575]  We can only see God's backside, basically, like Moses.
[02:47:05.915 --> 02:47:14.261]  But what I'm telling you is, you need to then, in my opinion, say, God, show me.
[02:47:14.341 --> 02:47:17.564]  Because God will not push you around.
[02:47:19.028 --> 02:47:20.509]  So it's about your free will.
[02:47:20.549 --> 02:47:23.110]  God made you because you have free will, Cindy.
[02:47:23.170 --> 02:47:24.830]  That's why God won't mess with your free will.
[02:47:24.850 --> 02:47:25.450]  Do you understand that?
[02:47:27.051 --> 02:47:27.351]  I do.
[02:47:28.071 --> 02:47:34.754]  So God will not directly intervene in your life unless you ask God to.
[02:47:35.074 --> 02:47:35.834]  I appreciate your call.
[02:47:35.854 --> 02:47:36.775]  That's a decision for you to make.
[02:47:37.415 --> 02:47:40.816]  I would suggest you launch yourself into a wider world right now, Cindy.
[02:47:40.856 --> 02:47:41.156]  Thank you.
[02:47:42.097 --> 02:47:44.077]  Joshua in New Mexico.
[02:47:44.138 --> 02:47:44.818]  Thanks for calling.
[02:47:44.838 --> 02:47:45.158]  Go ahead.
[02:47:46.209 --> 02:47:47.670]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:47:47.690 --> 02:47:48.270]  Can you hear me alright?
[02:47:48.350 --> 02:47:49.110]  I can, thank you.
[02:47:50.150 --> 02:47:54.012]  Alright, yeah, real quick, I just want to do a quick plug for your products.
[02:47:55.492 --> 02:48:02.575]  I started getting your products over a year ago, and the first ones that I got was X2, Super Mel Vitality, and Living Defense.
[02:48:03.656 --> 02:48:08.657]  And I noticed right away, after taking those, I just, I felt much more stamina.
[02:48:08.677 --> 02:48:11.719]  I wouldn't say that I had more energy, I could just feel that I had much more stamina.
[02:48:12.299 --> 02:48:15.100]  And so since then, I've just, you know, been a full-on believer.
[02:48:16.187 --> 02:48:17.828]  Order as many things as I can.
[02:48:17.908 --> 02:48:18.929]  I've tried all your products.
[02:48:18.969 --> 02:48:22.131]  My personal favorite is, of course, anything with iodine, X2.
[02:48:22.391 --> 02:48:23.912]  Right now I got, well, I ordered some more.
[02:48:24.613 --> 02:48:25.453]  I got X3.
[02:48:25.613 --> 02:48:27.134]  I think X2's better, in my opinion.
[02:48:27.615 --> 02:48:28.335]  But they're both good.
[02:48:28.635 --> 02:48:29.236]  I take them both.
[02:48:29.436 --> 02:48:31.637]  I love 1776 testosterone.
[02:48:32.978 --> 02:48:34.219]  Brain Force is awesome.
[02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:39.543]  Also, I want to let a lot of people know out there, too, that it's not just about how I feel.
[02:48:39.563 --> 02:48:42.185]  There's also real results that I've seen from your products.
[02:48:42.645 --> 02:48:44.146]  I started giving my dad your products.
[02:48:44.907 --> 02:48:49.270]  And like I said, it started the same with him as just iodine and living defense.
[02:48:49.730 --> 02:48:54.693]  And then because, you know, he's had some heart issues in the past, I started giving him the ultimate krill oil.
[02:48:55.934 --> 02:49:06.760]  And after taking that roughly on and off for, you know, about a year's time or something, whenever he went to the doctor and took his checkups and they did blood tests and everything like that, everything was improved across the board, essentially.
[02:49:07.360 --> 02:49:11.203]  And so he didn't make any big, you know, lifetime changes.
[02:49:11.283 --> 02:49:11.643]  He didn't
[02:49:12.305 --> 02:49:13.266]  Our lifestyle changes.
[02:49:13.306 --> 02:49:14.287]  He didn't exercise more.
[02:49:14.488 --> 02:49:15.509]  You know, he did the same stuff.
[02:49:15.549 --> 02:49:17.331]  The only thing that changed were those products.
[02:49:17.471 --> 02:49:19.734]  And it definitely, definitely moved the needle.
[02:49:20.777 --> 02:49:21.257]  Absolutely.
[02:49:21.517 --> 02:49:27.199]  By the way, it's not denied that pure fish oil or pure krill oil is incredible for your brain, heart, cardiovascular.
[02:49:27.639 --> 02:49:32.421]  The problem is the cheaper brands do almost nothing because they're homogenized.
[02:49:32.441 --> 02:49:36.622]  They boil it because they boil down much of the fish or much of the krill.
[02:49:37.042 --> 02:49:40.684]  It's got to be cold-pressed and it's the medical-grade stuff we sell.
[02:49:40.984 --> 02:49:44.185]  You go to any major doctor's office or any longevity office,
[02:49:44.705 --> 02:49:49.429]  They're selling the same stuff we sell, and the problem is it gives you terrible burps, so I would take it with a meal.
[02:49:49.449 --> 02:49:51.751]  It's not as effective as that, but I just can't take it alone.
[02:49:52.271 --> 02:49:56.554]  But it gives you amazing energy, everything, and it's the essence of your body.
[02:49:56.734 --> 02:49:59.356]  And I'll say krill is even better than the fish.
[02:49:59.397 --> 02:50:02.419]  We have the best fish, the best krill, and it's amazing.
[02:50:03.624 --> 02:50:06.425]  I'd order krill if you had it again, but I just settled for the ultimate fish oil.
[02:50:06.445 --> 02:50:14.446]  But here's the funny thing, Alex, is that my dad never said that he had fish burps or he never saw Santa Claus when he went to sleep at night, but he's still got all these benefits.
[02:50:14.466 --> 02:50:21.048]  No, I mean, let me tell you, if you want to have incredible dreams, take three or four fish oils or a couple krill oils before you go to bed.
[02:50:21.588 --> 02:50:22.788]  It's definitely psychotropic.
[02:50:22.808 --> 02:50:25.548]  I mean, it's not listed as that, but it does incredible things.
[02:50:25.609 --> 02:50:27.569]  And I thought we had krill oil back in stock, I guess.
[02:50:28.169 --> 02:50:28.989]  Both are sold out.
[02:50:29.049 --> 02:50:29.430]  Whatever.
[02:50:29.510 --> 02:50:30.430]  It's all insane.
[02:50:30.450 --> 02:50:31.851]  But don't even get ours, folks.
[02:50:31.891 --> 02:50:32.551]  Just get one.
[02:50:32.931 --> 02:50:38.373]  Like, if people can't get X2, go out and get a Himalayan salt or a sea salt that's purple or pink.
[02:50:38.713 --> 02:50:40.094]  That's got some of the real iodine in it.
[02:50:40.394 --> 02:50:42.675]  So thank you so much for the call, Joshua.
[02:50:42.895 --> 02:50:43.776]  Thank you so much for the plug.
[02:50:43.816 --> 02:50:45.356]  What was the news?
[02:50:45.456 --> 02:50:46.137]  Oh, they hung up on me.
[02:50:46.457 --> 02:50:47.037]  I messed up.
[02:50:47.897 --> 02:50:48.698]  Joshua, call back.
[02:50:48.838 --> 02:50:49.418]  I apologize.
[02:50:49.438 --> 02:50:50.058]  We can get back in.
[02:50:51.479 --> 02:50:53.620]  I meant, like, what's your next point?
[02:50:54.502 --> 02:50:55.423]  Hey Alex, great to talk to you.
[02:50:55.463 --> 02:50:55.703]  God bless.
[02:50:55.723 --> 02:50:56.623]  God bless you.
[02:51:21.943 --> 02:51:22.503]  Quick plug.
[02:51:23.464 --> 02:51:26.807]  Well, all your products that I've tried, they work.
[02:51:27.428 --> 02:51:29.009]  They're all legit.
[02:51:29.029 --> 02:51:33.072]  But wanted to plug HGH Max Boost.
[02:51:34.693 --> 02:51:37.616]  Been sleeping far better, waking up more rested.
[02:51:38.857 --> 02:51:41.439]  Lean muscle mass has just greatly improved.
[02:51:42.140 --> 02:51:49.205]  And a kind of added plus that I wasn't expecting is the little man has gotten far meatier.
[02:51:50.649 --> 02:51:55.792]  A lot more weight, a lot more girth, so very pleased with that.
[02:52:12.850 --> 02:52:18.132]  Yeah, well, unfortunately, I didn't get to try the other formula, but this one has worked great for me.
[02:52:18.152 --> 02:52:20.352]  Well, if you think the new one's great, the other one was too powerful.
[02:52:21.613 --> 02:52:24.533]  But, I mean, we've beefed up some stuff less than some of the others, but yeah.
[02:52:26.054 --> 02:52:27.874]  So, yeah, I just wanted to plug that.
[02:52:27.994 --> 02:52:34.156]  I'm thoroughly happy with all your products, though, but that HGH Max Boost 2.0 has just been great for me.
[02:52:36.497 --> 02:52:39.418]  Just wanted to speak to the Infowar family real quick.
[02:52:40.959 --> 02:52:48.963]  I just wanted to remind everybody that it says in God's Word that God turns all things for good for those who love Him.
[02:52:50.063 --> 02:53:01.248]  And so if you truly love and trust God with all your heart, no matter how dark and nasty this world gets, God is going to turn all things for good.
[02:53:02.311 --> 02:53:09.300]  I agree, but you've got to know though, me or I may get tortured to death, but then it saves a hundred thousand children.
[02:53:09.380 --> 02:53:11.042]  So you have to realize it's long game.
[02:53:11.483 --> 02:53:13.285]  God may sacrifice us for the greater good.
[02:53:13.305 --> 02:53:14.106]  We've got to be ready for that.
[02:53:15.207 --> 02:53:16.489]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[02:53:16.569 --> 02:53:20.514]  So you might have to go through some trials and tribulation, but in the end,
[02:53:21.431 --> 02:53:23.372]  All things will be good for you.
[02:53:23.452 --> 02:53:24.332]  Yeah, read that passage.
[02:53:24.352 --> 02:53:25.873]  I forget where that is in the Bible.
[02:53:25.893 --> 02:53:26.853]  Such a beautiful passage.
[02:53:26.873 --> 02:53:27.654]  Say that again.
[02:53:27.674 --> 02:53:28.634]  I don't have it on hand.
[02:53:29.094 --> 02:53:29.815]  No, guys, pull it up.
[02:53:29.835 --> 02:53:32.056]  God will turn all things towards good.
[02:53:32.076 --> 02:53:32.556]  The Bible verse.
[02:53:33.356 --> 02:53:34.317]  But say the verse again.
[02:53:34.337 --> 02:53:38.698]  If we love God, if we trust God, He will turn all things towards good.
[02:53:38.758 --> 02:53:39.639]  What's the exact quote?
[02:53:40.479 --> 02:53:44.661]  He said He will turn all things for good for those who love God.
[02:53:47.276 --> 02:53:47.836]  And that's true.
[02:53:47.896 --> 02:53:48.537]  It's in the word.
[02:53:48.797 --> 02:53:49.237]  It's true.
[02:53:49.497 --> 02:53:52.279]  Well, I never even, I knew that, but I never really lived it.
[02:53:52.319 --> 02:53:53.079]  I wasn't worried about it.
[02:53:53.099 --> 02:53:53.900]  I was going to do what I was going to do.
[02:53:53.920 --> 02:53:56.861]  But I've always noticed the worse the attack, the more painful.
[02:53:57.601 --> 02:54:00.983]  I'm always like, wait, around the corner, something even 10 times better is going to happen.
[02:54:01.323 --> 02:54:02.704]  So I've learned to almost enjoy it.
[02:54:02.724 --> 02:54:03.324]  Does that make sense?
[02:54:04.425 --> 02:54:05.005]  Absolutely.
[02:54:05.025 --> 02:54:09.328]  And that's because we're not building up treasure for ourselves here on earth.
[02:54:09.368 --> 02:54:11.869]  We're building up treasure for the afterlife.
[02:54:13.070 --> 02:54:15.431]  And so your treasures are in another place.
[02:54:16.318 --> 02:54:19.080]  And they don't rot and rust away.
[02:54:19.100 --> 02:54:21.802]  They're treasures for eternity.
[02:54:22.843 --> 02:54:27.046]  And the treasure is closeness to God and wisdom to help others.
[02:54:27.847 --> 02:54:29.008]  That's when you finally get the treasure.
[02:54:29.048 --> 02:54:31.690]  It's not a car or a box of diamonds or gold.
[02:54:31.770 --> 02:54:32.931]  It's literally consciousness.
[02:54:33.832 --> 02:54:34.432]  Absolutely.
[02:54:34.872 --> 02:54:39.296]  And one more point I wanted to make, Alex, as we head into Christmas time.
[02:54:40.457 --> 02:54:42.458]  I believe it's Micah 5.5, where it says,
[02:54:46.636 --> 02:54:53.099]  And it's Micah prophesying about the coming of Christ, and that Jesus Christ is peace.
[02:54:54.240 --> 02:54:55.141]  He is peace.
[02:54:56.241 --> 02:55:00.763]  And so if you want true peace in your life, you need Jesus Christ in your life.
[02:55:01.024 --> 02:55:07.807]  Well, that's what I was telling the lady earlier, is that the real God does not force himself on you.
[02:55:07.827 --> 02:55:09.108]  She's got to ask God to come in.
[02:55:10.369 --> 02:55:14.891]  That's true, because he's knocking at the door, and it's up to you to open the door
[02:55:15.453 --> 02:55:16.933]  And let him into your life.
[02:55:17.894 --> 02:55:21.394]  And then he will move in your life like you would not believe.
[02:55:21.434 --> 02:55:22.455]  And I love those.
[02:55:22.475 --> 02:55:23.275]  She could feel it.
[02:55:23.455 --> 02:55:25.595]  There was an evil thing blocking it right there.
[02:55:25.615 --> 02:55:27.436]  She's like, I want to, I want to.
[02:55:27.536 --> 02:55:28.696]  All she's got to do is say it.
[02:55:29.776 --> 02:55:30.877]  She's just got to submit.
[02:55:31.697 --> 02:55:36.998]  She's just got to make herself vulnerable and open that door and let God in.
[02:55:38.058 --> 02:55:41.399]  And it's a big deal, because you will feel shamed, folks.
[02:55:41.479 --> 02:55:45.620]  If you've not had God in your life before and you open the door, you're going to see who you really are.
[02:55:45.660 --> 02:55:48.480]  It's big, but I mean, it's great, though.
[02:55:49.620 --> 02:55:49.980]  Amen.
[02:55:50.160 --> 02:55:50.721]  It really is.
[02:55:51.421 --> 02:55:53.161]  So hopefully that lady takes your advice.
[02:55:53.901 --> 02:55:54.441]  Thank you, Nathan.
[02:55:54.461 --> 02:55:55.041]  Beautiful call.
[02:55:55.441 --> 02:55:55.742]  All right.
[02:55:57.262 --> 02:55:58.702]  Let's hear him in Calvin, California.
[02:55:58.742 --> 02:55:59.322]  Go ahead, Calvin.
[02:56:01.183 --> 02:56:01.763]  Hey, Alex.
[02:56:01.803 --> 02:56:02.243]  How you doing?
[02:56:02.263 --> 02:56:03.023]  This is Calvin.
[02:56:04.775 --> 02:56:15.478]  Hey, listening to you this morning, you were talking about your joy, which I understand the feeling over the last several years, what we've gone through, because I used to be the happy-go-lucky guy, too.
[02:56:16.258 --> 02:56:24.780]  And I was just reading the Bible yesterday about that very thing, and it brought it to mind when you said it, so can I read it?
[02:56:24.920 --> 02:56:26.820]  It's a quick scripture.
[02:56:26.900 --> 02:56:28.160]  Go ahead.
[02:56:28.381 --> 02:56:34.362]  Jesus said, when you obey me and you remain in my love, just as I obey
[02:56:35.191 --> 02:56:42.574]  My Father, and remain in His love, I have told you this, so that you will be filled with My joy.
[02:56:43.154 --> 02:56:45.115]  Yes, your joy will overflow.
[02:56:45.855 --> 02:56:51.517]  So anyway, it just brought me to mind that you... That's right, Christ is the circuit breaker that brings it into earth.
[02:56:52.598 --> 02:56:53.018]  Correct.
[02:56:55.018 --> 02:57:02.601]  And if you're following Him, He will bring that joy back to you, and you'll be filled with His joy.
[02:57:03.402 --> 02:57:04.322]  It'll overflow you.
[02:57:04.733 --> 02:57:06.614]  It'll control your life.
[02:57:07.295 --> 02:57:11.397]  You'll be one, like you said, with that God, the Father of the Universe, Jesus.
[02:57:12.658 --> 02:57:15.140]  He'll bring that joy to you, and He's brought it back to me.
[02:57:15.300 --> 02:57:16.220]  He's filled my life.
[02:57:17.801 --> 02:57:23.285]  Not just there, but everyday things, and things I see, and His presence is always with me.
[02:57:24.125 --> 02:57:28.188]  And it's even stronger now, I think because of all the tyranny we've come under.
[02:57:29.148 --> 02:57:31.930]  So with great, great strife comes great power.
[02:57:32.964 --> 02:57:33.645]  And it's up to us to get you back.
[02:57:33.665 --> 02:57:35.547]  That's right, the beginning of knowledge is sorrow.
[02:57:35.587 --> 02:57:39.111]  I don't want to cut you off, but I got to go because I got to get to Jack and Lewis.
[02:57:39.231 --> 02:57:40.553]  And then I'm going to have some fun.
[02:57:40.593 --> 02:57:41.974]  People want jokes and have some fun.
[02:57:42.515 --> 02:57:43.936]  We got Fartgate coming up.
[02:57:44.317 --> 02:57:45.118]  So stay with us.
[02:57:48.030 --> 02:57:51.513]  Never forget that the answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:57:52.894 --> 02:57:57.138]  We've come a long way in the fight against tyranny, and it's been listeners and viewers like you that have kept us on air.

[02:58:47.967 --> 02:58:52.790]  Please listen closely because this is life-changing critical information.
[02:58:53.390 --> 02:59:03.236]  The globalists are bombarding us with toxic chemicals hitting us in the air, the water, the food, the 5G, the poison shots, the shedding.
[02:59:04.236 --> 02:59:04.677]  I think so.
[02:59:27.837 --> 02:59:31.259]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:24.262 --> 03:00:26.064]  The whole universe was built for us.
[03:00:27.465 --> 03:00:28.145]  As a test.
[03:00:30.167 --> 03:00:31.127]  Beyond the infinite.
[03:00:31.287 --> 03:00:32.869]  Into eternity.
[03:00:32.889 --> 03:00:36.351]  An infinity of eternity.
[03:00:36.591 --> 03:00:38.713]  Jack in Chicago, then Lewis in Massachusetts.
[03:00:38.733 --> 03:00:39.674]  You're on the air, Jack.
[03:00:41.395 --> 03:00:43.216]  Uh, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[03:00:43.236 --> 03:00:43.617]  Love you.
[03:00:43.637 --> 03:00:50.542]  Uh, real quick, while we're on the, uh, you know, the subject of testimonials, I personally
[03:00:51.480 --> 03:00:54.721]  Um, my mother died when I was six.
[03:00:54.741 --> 03:00:57.382]  I took offense to God.
[03:00:57.402 --> 03:01:00.763]  I thought that God took my mother away from me.
[03:01:01.443 --> 03:01:04.964]  And so I grew up kind of a bad kid.
[03:01:05.604 --> 03:01:09.865]  And I got sent to Maryville Academy up in Eagle River, Wisconsin.
[03:01:10.605 --> 03:01:13.586]  And during that time, I was trying to like, sort of
[03:01:14.932 --> 03:01:22.475]  Get, like, bonus points, brownie points from whoever I could just to get out of whatever situation I was in.
[03:01:23.256 --> 03:01:39.242]  And in that process, I joined a born-again Christian church, thinking that this is a bunch of ridiculousness, and I'm going to, you know, push this to my advantage to get out quicker.
[03:01:39.932 --> 03:01:58.742]  So, what I did is I joined the Born Again Christian Church, and I said, I will give my life to Christ, and I was sitting in a circle of a bunch of people from Eagle River, Wisconsin, and what happened was not what I expected.
[03:01:59.102 --> 03:02:01.724]  I expected fallacy.
[03:02:01.824 --> 03:02:03.065]  I expected nothing.
[03:02:03.345 --> 03:02:09.308]  I expected nothing from this, and all of a sudden, God punched me in the face.
[03:02:10.223 --> 03:02:12.145]  As hard as he could, and he said, you know what?
[03:02:12.846 --> 03:02:13.406]  I'm God.
[03:02:13.706 --> 03:02:14.347]  You're not.
[03:02:14.887 --> 03:02:15.708]  And guess what?
[03:02:16.149 --> 03:02:18.070]  You just gave your life to me.
[03:02:18.371 --> 03:02:21.533]  And I was like, born again.
[03:02:21.553 --> 03:02:24.056]  I don't know what happened, Alex.
[03:02:24.356 --> 03:02:25.077]  But you know what?
[03:02:25.797 --> 03:02:26.718]  That is the message.
[03:02:26.738 --> 03:02:28.680]  Well, you know, you opened the circuit.
[03:02:28.720 --> 03:02:29.621]  You opened up to it.
[03:02:31.084 --> 03:02:32.625]  Right, because I had no choice.
[03:02:32.685 --> 03:02:34.967]  I thought, how was I going to get out of this?
[03:02:35.267 --> 03:02:41.891]  How am I going to get out of my hatred for somebody who took my mother at age of six?
[03:02:42.752 --> 03:02:45.794]  And there was so much anger and resentment.
[03:02:46.274 --> 03:02:49.817]  And then all of a sudden, it was like a washing over feeling.
[03:02:50.117 --> 03:02:52.739]  I've never experienced anything like this in my life.
[03:02:53.359 --> 03:02:55.801]  Well, that's the comforting of the Holy Spirit.
[03:02:57.145 --> 03:03:05.410]  It is, and I'm telling you, the point of my call was to tell you that you are the groundbreaker for the mainstream media.
[03:03:05.751 --> 03:03:10.434]  You are going to be the mainstream media, not the mainstream media.
[03:03:10.834 --> 03:03:19.379]  We are turning the tides, and I love you, and I cannot believe what is transpiring right now, and we are going to win.
[03:03:19.640 --> 03:03:20.900]  No, I love you too.
[03:03:21.080 --> 03:03:22.181]  You called it about the Tucker interview.
[03:03:22.201 --> 03:03:22.762]  What do you think of that?
[03:03:23.122 --> 03:03:23.682]  Pretty powerful.
[03:03:23.962 --> 03:03:26.344]  Well, I think, quite frankly,
[03:03:27.530 --> 03:03:40.817]  Quickly, I think that Pucker woke up himself and I think that, you know, whatever, you know, whatever definition of mainstream media is completely dissolved.
[03:03:41.717 --> 03:03:42.637]  It's all lies.
[03:03:43.298 --> 03:03:44.518]  Well, that's it.
[03:03:44.598 --> 03:03:46.099]  I mean, I know all about his past.
[03:03:46.139 --> 03:03:46.719]  I read his book.
[03:03:47.440 --> 03:03:51.502]  He was a really sweet, smart guy that thought everybody was nice and was naive.
[03:03:51.542 --> 03:03:54.143]  But once he woke up, now they got a big problem on their hands.
[03:03:54.423 --> 03:03:56.304]  And he's really the archetype of what's about to happen.
[03:03:58.081 --> 03:03:59.302]  I agree, and you know what?
[03:03:59.382 --> 03:04:02.145]  And that's why we're going to turn this around, and that's why we're going to win.
[03:04:03.286 --> 03:04:04.327]  Well, God bless you, brother.
[03:04:04.347 --> 03:04:05.909]  Any closing comments, Jack?
[03:04:07.250 --> 03:04:09.492]  No, I don't, but you know what?
[03:04:09.793 --> 03:04:14.037]  It's game over for the leftists and the New World Order.
[03:04:14.217 --> 03:04:17.420]  We're not going to sit here and allow them to win.
[03:04:17.820 --> 03:04:20.363]  We are going to win this fight.
[03:04:21.044 --> 03:04:24.285]  With black, white, purple, green, it doesn't matter.
[03:04:24.745 --> 03:04:28.166]  We are going to join together and we are going to beat these people.
[03:04:28.326 --> 03:04:31.567]  I agree, though, but you're in a point of awakening, so you see the victory now.
[03:04:31.667 --> 03:04:33.568]  It is coming, but it's going to be long and hard.
[03:04:34.088 --> 03:04:34.989]  I appreciate your call.
[03:04:35.009 --> 03:04:36.129]  I want people to know that, though.
[03:04:36.529 --> 03:04:37.689]  The beginning of the victory's happened.
[03:04:37.930 --> 03:04:41.111]  All right, I don't want to take time from Jay Dyer, but I've got to take one more call, hit this final piece of news.
[03:04:41.431 --> 03:04:42.651]  So we'll skip both network breaks.
[03:04:42.811 --> 03:04:43.411]  That's eight minutes.
[03:04:43.831 --> 03:04:44.812]  He will get all his time back.
[03:04:45.612 --> 03:04:47.214]  And so Jay Dyer does an amazing job.
[03:04:47.254 --> 03:04:47.814]  Great author.
[03:04:47.834 --> 03:04:49.135]  Goes right off their own documents.
[03:04:49.696 --> 03:04:50.597]  What a time to be alive.
[03:04:50.617 --> 03:04:52.078]  What an incredible point in the universe.
[03:04:52.999 --> 03:04:53.659]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:53.679 --> 03:04:54.100]  Stay with us.
[03:05:00.216 --> 03:05:01.617]  Last year we put this book out.
[03:05:02.457 --> 03:05:03.878]  The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[03:05:03.898 --> 03:05:05.678]  It became a number one national bestseller.
[03:05:06.258 --> 03:05:09.480]  Now we've put part two out and it's even thicker and more powerful.
[03:05:10.040 --> 03:05:10.920]  The Great Awakening.
[03:05:11.020 --> 03:05:14.862]  The plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[03:05:15.282 --> 03:05:16.923]  This is such a powerful book.
[03:05:17.323 --> 03:05:19.004]  It covers all the globalist plans.
[03:05:19.684 --> 03:05:20.145]  We're good to go.
[03:05:38.826 --> 03:05:46.308]  This is next level information and it's a great way to not just support the broadcast, but inform yourself to the next level and share the book with friends and family.

[03:05:56.910 --> 03:05:57.491]  Get yours now.
[03:05:59.651 --> 03:06:03.112]  Of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:10.805 --> 03:06:15.128]  Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis, best-selling author, expert on the New World Order, takes over here in a few minutes.
[03:06:15.509 --> 03:06:20.653]  I wanted to finish up with a call, hit one more piece of news, and then Jay Dyer is in command.
[03:06:22.054 --> 03:06:23.915]  Lewis in Massachusetts, you're on the air.
[03:06:23.975 --> 03:06:25.136]  Last caller, you're a telegunner.
[03:06:26.617 --> 03:06:27.838]  How you doing, Mr. Jones?
[03:06:28.218 --> 03:06:28.979]  I'm doing all right.
[03:06:29.019 --> 03:06:29.960]  I'm definitely in the middle of it.
[03:06:31.361 --> 03:06:37.305]  Well, I always wanted to talk to you, I mean, and I'm talking to you right now, sir.
[03:06:37.726 --> 03:06:37.986]  You are?
[03:06:39.306 --> 03:06:44.428]  All right, so my thing here was, um, I did had a dream, right?
[03:06:44.769 --> 03:06:46.669]  And I know you were talking about your dreams.
[03:06:47.550 --> 03:06:50.111]  Um, my dream was very weird.
[03:06:50.431 --> 03:07:01.056]  Um, it happened where I saw things falling from the sky and it looked like first birds, you know, like fiery birds, but I know that's not possible.
[03:07:01.136 --> 03:07:05.178]  So it could have been, um, you know, firing rockets, um,
[03:07:06.520 --> 03:07:13.683]  Um, war missiles or an asteroid, um, you know, breaking to pieces or whatever it is.
[03:07:13.783 --> 03:07:22.766]  But the thing is, um, I was the third caller, um, other than you talking to Cindy and I do have a cousin named Cindy.
[03:07:22.846 --> 03:07:29.788]  So when you do the three points, that is a, um, a pyramid, it matches like a pyramid.
[03:07:30.468 --> 03:07:32.909]  And the thing is that I had an accident.
[03:07:33.630 --> 03:07:40.916]  Where a glass went through my wrist, and when it healed, it had the shape of a pyramid.
[03:07:43.018 --> 03:07:43.899]  What do you think about that?
[03:07:43.919 --> 03:07:45.780]  Yeah, I cut my finger off.
[03:07:47.021 --> 03:07:49.604]  One time, in an accident, when they sawed it back on, it made a pyramid.
[03:07:49.944 --> 03:07:50.885]  Overhead shot right there.
[03:07:51.345 --> 03:07:54.968]  But listen... Yeah, but I did let it heal.
[03:07:55.549 --> 03:08:00.433]  They didn't sew or anything, and it just imprinted like a pyramid.
[03:08:00.773 --> 03:08:01.153]  Interesting.
[03:08:02.333 --> 03:08:03.693]  Yeah, like a pyramid, you know.
[03:08:03.713 --> 03:08:04.373]  A pyramid?
[03:08:05.334 --> 03:08:07.294]  Yeah, a pyramid.
[03:08:07.914 --> 03:08:10.555]  I could email you a photo and you'll see what I mean.
[03:08:10.615 --> 03:08:11.175]  I hear you, brother.
[03:08:11.215 --> 03:08:14.516]  What do you want to get into real quick?
[03:08:14.556 --> 03:08:16.836]  Birds are an archetypal symbol of harbingers.
[03:08:17.656 --> 03:08:21.057]  So, fiery birds can mean a lot of things to the subconscious brain.
[03:08:21.537 --> 03:08:25.718]  Sounds like a brain-derived dream.
[03:08:26.724 --> 03:08:28.725]  Of course there are dreams from outside the brain as well.
[03:08:28.745 --> 03:08:30.967]  There's interdimensional projection dreams.
[03:08:30.987 --> 03:08:32.008]  There's a lot of different types of them.
[03:08:32.328 --> 03:08:33.909]  The brain is quite the instrument.
[03:08:35.710 --> 03:08:39.213]  But the thing about this dream is that people were dying.
[03:08:39.613 --> 03:08:40.914]  Oh, I bet.
[03:08:41.254 --> 03:08:46.538]  And it hit everybody and the only one that it didn't hit was me.
[03:08:47.379 --> 03:08:56.185]  So I saw a person coming from a cloud and he actually took my hand and then that's when I died.
[03:08:57.213 --> 03:08:58.136]  Powerful dream, brother.
[03:08:58.156 --> 03:09:00.283]  I appreciate your call.
[03:09:00.604 --> 03:09:01.005]  Interesting.
[03:09:01.025 --> 03:09:02.369]  A lot of wild calls today.
[03:09:02.751 --> 03:09:03.714]  Thank you so much for the call.
[03:09:04.864 --> 03:09:07.365]  Alright, the crew has told me, and I actually agree, we should have more fun.
[03:09:07.565 --> 03:09:22.251]  So, three days ago this video came out, and I'm like, I'm not even going to play it, it's not serious, we got World War III, Biden said we're going to invade Russia, total insanity, the Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff saying, you know, give us unlimited money or the U.S.
[03:09:22.491 --> 03:09:23.811]  kids will die within a month.
[03:09:23.911 --> 03:09:24.952]  I mean, this is crazy.
[03:09:25.552 --> 03:09:27.593]  So I'm like, I'm not going to cover John Kerry at COP28.
[03:09:29.352 --> 03:09:30.173]  We're good to go.
[03:09:47.714 --> 03:09:48.535]  I'm being serious here.
[03:09:48.575 --> 03:09:54.165]  If he wants all the cows to have these torture devices, he should stop flying on private jets, which he hasn't done.
[03:09:54.185 --> 03:09:54.665]  He owns one.
[03:09:55.206 --> 03:09:57.330]  And he should have a giant fart bag put on him.
[03:09:57.730 --> 03:09:59.413]  And that's not the joke part of this.
[03:10:00.396 --> 03:10:14.302]  I thought we put together a short compilation of Fartgate with Al Gore saying we are an open sir, and then Kerry, Biden, Swallow's Well, and Biden and others, and then that's all real.
[03:10:14.342 --> 03:10:21.806]  The first of it is he's real, then we put together a little joke reel of stuff that's augmented before the media runs with it and says we're putting out fake videos.
[03:10:22.506 --> 03:10:27.269]  All these guys need giant fart bags, which was a joke, but they're saying you're bad too, folks.
[03:10:27.309 --> 03:10:30.591]  Not just the cows that pass gas that make the atmosphere, methane's good for the atmosphere.
[03:10:30.871 --> 03:10:32.412]  They're actually saying you're all bad.
[03:10:32.472 --> 03:10:35.674]  Bill Gates has cut down trees now to save the Earth, so here's a compilation.
[03:10:36.794 --> 03:10:38.815]  We're using the sky as an open sewer.
[03:10:39.015 --> 03:10:41.737]  Those things that are killing people on a daily basis.
[03:10:42.678 --> 03:10:46.900]  And the reality is that... A black man in minutes.
[03:10:51.843 --> 03:10:58.306]  The evidence is uncontradicted that the president used taxpayer dollars to ask the Ukrainians to help him cheat in an election.
[03:10:58.466 --> 03:11:05.789]  You don't have to cut those teachers and firefighters, police officers, and cut critical health care programs, or stop work on roads and bridges.
[03:11:05.889 --> 03:11:08.330]  So, that all really happened.
[03:11:09.031 --> 03:11:10.391]  Now here's the joke part of the real.
[03:11:11.772 --> 03:11:16.754]  The scientists are saying this moment is alarming.
[03:11:18.094 --> 03:11:19.055]  It's without precedent.
[03:11:20.626 --> 03:11:22.828]  It is terrifying, some have said.
[03:11:23.749 --> 03:11:28.013]  And others will say we are in uncharted territory.
[03:11:33.371 --> 03:11:34.672]  So, you want to have some fun?
[03:11:35.192 --> 03:11:50.564]  Play the famous, they did this, tens of thousands of like 7X underwear more than 10 years ago that Obama ordered because they had so many millions coming across, they needed tens of thousands of pairs of underwear for that many fat people.
[03:11:51.184 --> 03:11:51.805]  Here's that clip.
[03:11:53.037 --> 03:11:59.658]  2,000 pairs, 6X, for the illegal aliens from south of Mexico that bus up on a train every day.
[03:11:59.678 --> 03:12:04.079]  To understand, folks, you could wear this, I could wear this as a onesie, okay?
[03:12:04.759 --> 03:12:06.960]  I could wear this as a leotard.
[03:12:07.680 --> 03:12:13.581]  I mean, I mean... Oh my God.
[03:12:14.581 --> 03:12:18.122]  Oh my God, we're being invaded by South American walruses.
[03:12:21.674 --> 03:12:24.695]  The government is shipping in 42,000 people.
[03:12:24.755 --> 03:12:28.897]  That's bigger than Jabba the Hutt.
[03:12:30.757 --> 03:12:32.798]  This country is so screwed up, man.
[03:12:35.759 --> 03:12:39.320]  I'm sorry, I don't mean to laugh, but it's reaching a proportion.
[03:12:39.640 --> 03:12:41.781]  If you're a radio listener, you can't see him.
[03:12:44.752 --> 03:12:51.335]  Oh my god, look at this!
[03:12:52.395 --> 03:12:55.116]  I don't think I've ever laughed this hard on air.
[03:12:55.136 --> 03:12:59.497]  Oh my god, it's so ridiculous!
[03:12:59.597 --> 03:13:04.679]  42,000 pairs, 6x, of illegal aliens from south of Mexico.
[03:13:04.699 --> 03:13:05.099]  I said 7x or 6x.
[03:13:07.102 --> 03:13:08.423]  All right, so there's the fun bit.
[03:13:08.443 --> 03:13:09.423]  They put the cows on screen.
[03:13:09.443 --> 03:13:10.184]  That was not a joke.
[03:13:10.204 --> 03:13:15.106]  They fed them with huge torture devices up their rear ends, and then they do this saying that they're bad.
[03:13:15.446 --> 03:13:17.747]  Well, John Kerry, I demand John Kerry.
[03:13:17.967 --> 03:13:20.889]  He looked good, actually, with that big pink bag on his back.
[03:13:21.349 --> 03:13:22.590]  They would be embarrassed up there.
[03:13:23.150 --> 03:13:27.712]  Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis, author, researcher, great American, takes over.
[03:13:27.752 --> 03:13:28.713]  Jay Dyer, thank you so much.
[03:13:29.704 --> 03:13:30.044]  Thank you.
[03:13:30.084 --> 03:13:31.726]  Wasn't there an AOC clip?
[03:13:31.766 --> 03:13:37.310]  I don't know if it was real or not, but AOC was doing some SBD when she was letting it rip.
[03:13:37.370 --> 03:13:38.451]  I don't know.
[03:13:38.911 --> 03:13:39.852]  We're just having some fun.
[03:13:40.993 --> 03:13:44.696]  Luke Rudowsky shared that clip, so I don't know if it was real or not, but I can believe it.
[03:13:44.716 --> 03:13:49.520]  Seems like the Democrats got some irritable bowel problems, but I don't want to talk about it.
[03:13:49.620 --> 03:13:51.081]  Shouldn't they put the cow bags on them?
[03:13:52.162 --> 03:13:52.763]  Absolutely.
[03:13:54.344 --> 03:13:56.806]  Sorry, I had to have some fun in this crazy world.
[03:13:57.506 --> 03:13:58.547]  Start over, I'm going to be watching.
[03:13:58.567 --> 03:13:59.188]  Go ahead, start the show.
[03:14:00.960 --> 03:14:04.381]  So, we just had the passing of Henry Kissinger.
[03:14:04.681 --> 03:14:05.841]  Again, passing.
[03:14:07.022 --> 03:14:07.822]  Farts are in my head.
[03:14:07.842 --> 03:14:09.122]  That's all I can think about, passing.
[03:14:09.682 --> 03:14:13.623]  The death of Henry Kissinger this last week, and he's one of the key global architects.
[03:14:13.643 --> 03:14:16.364]  I know that this was on your radar.
[03:14:16.384 --> 03:14:18.504]  I listened to that show when you covered it this week, Alex.
[03:14:18.524 --> 03:14:19.424]  I thought it was really good.
[03:14:19.965 --> 03:14:28.627]  I want to go into the history of Henry Kissinger, because a lot of the public information was all these glowing obituaries, and they didn't really go into his black ops stuff.
[03:14:28.807 --> 03:14:30.247]  Henry Kissinger did a ton of
[03:14:31.067 --> 03:14:34.470]  Really hardcore black ops operations, and there's a lot of books on this.
[03:14:34.550 --> 03:14:52.606]  I've read some of those texts, and so I'd like to talk about a few of those to give us an idea of how, really, at the government policy level, it was really Henry Kissinger who was the architect of putting the United States government on an official eugenics depopulation austerity policy.
[03:14:52.706 --> 03:14:56.470]  So, you know, we've heard of State Department memorandum 200, which Alex talks about,
[03:14:57.051 --> 03:14:57.231]  From 1974.
[03:14:57.271 --> 03:14:59.273]  The next year, they gave to Carter this Global 2000 report.
[03:15:04.196 --> 03:15:15.924]  The Global 2000 Report was basically this unreadable, gigantic, four or five hundred page text about breaking down all the metrics of the different areas of Latin South America, the Global South, basically.
[03:15:15.964 --> 03:15:30.534]  And it was arguing that we have to cut population in all possible ways, particularly through diet, particularly through making sure that other countries don't industrialize in order to control them, because if we don't, then there's not enough resources to go around.
[03:15:30.574 --> 03:15:31.975]  So back to that whole Malthusian narrative.
[03:15:31.995 --> 03:15:33.736]  But it was actually Kissinger who was key
[03:15:34.617 --> 03:15:38.640]  In getting this policy through and what how was he able to do this?
[03:15:38.660 --> 03:15:40.522]  Why was he such an important figure?
[03:15:40.542 --> 03:15:48.890]  Well, I think if we go back to his background in the 1930s Kissinger fled Nazi persecution and actually joined the US Army.
[03:15:49.571 --> 03:15:50.332]  But when he was in the U.S.
[03:15:50.392 --> 03:15:56.896]  Army, he did intelligence work, and this is a common pattern that we're going to see with a lot of the global elites, especially David Rockefeller as well.
[03:15:57.516 --> 03:16:12.246]  David mentions in his memoirs, there's a whole chapter in Rockefeller's memoirs about how he's a proud internationalist, how he's going to create these entities like the CFR, Trilateral Commission, Bilderberg, that will go on to really steer the world, these steering committees.
[03:16:12.913 --> 03:16:30.598]  And it was really the Rockefellers, especially Nelson, that took Kissinger under their wing to really mentor him to be the chess player agent, the grand architect of the Rockefeller plans for policy in the U.S.
[03:16:30.658 --> 03:16:31.098]  government.
[03:16:31.158 --> 03:16:34.639]  So Rockefellers, of course, are the wealthiest family in the U.S.
[03:16:34.679 --> 03:16:35.419]  as far as we know.
[03:16:36.379 --> 03:16:39.360]  One of the key elements for aligning with the Rothschild
[03:16:39.793 --> 03:16:47.058]  power structure in the UK to join in the Anglo-American establishment's designs to create what we know of as the New World Order.
[03:16:47.779 --> 03:16:52.662]  And Kissinger, his passing I think is one of the old guard.
[03:16:53.362 --> 03:16:57.065]  It was really Kissinger who was the mentor to and the recruiter of Brzezinski.
[03:16:57.745 --> 03:17:05.691]  It was David and Henry that recruited Zbig out of McGill University in the 1970s after Brzezinski had written
[03:17:06.388 --> 03:17:07.849]  The Between Two Ages text.
[03:17:08.109 --> 03:17:12.491]  And so they said, this guy, he needs his own steering committee, put him in charge of something.
[03:17:12.911 --> 03:17:15.353]  And they created the Trilateral Commission in the 1970s.
[03:17:16.093 --> 03:17:19.034]  But how was Kissinger able to do this?
[03:17:19.074 --> 03:17:20.935]  Why was he such a big deal?
[03:17:21.015 --> 03:17:25.898]  Well, not only did he work in intelligence in the Army,
[03:17:26.561 --> 03:17:35.005]  He also did some counterintelligence work, and when he left the military, he went to teach at Harvard and actually tried to be in the FBI.
[03:17:35.085 --> 03:17:41.528]  So we know from that that Kissinger had a really intense interest in counterintelligence, counterespionage work.
[03:17:41.968 --> 03:17:49.391]  He didn't end up getting hired by the FBI, but he did end up basically leveling up far beyond that, running things way bigger than just being an FBI operative.
[03:17:50.481 --> 03:18:01.590]  And so, as he is recruited into these higher level operations, he really becomes the front man, I guess you could say, for David Rockefeller, for Nelson Rockefeller.
[03:18:01.610 --> 03:18:08.216]  And this is actually how we get the 1970s China policy.
[03:18:08.256 --> 03:18:15.762]  If you heard Alex's interview with Roger Stone this last week, there's a lot of interesting insight into Roger Stone's take on
[03:18:16.206 --> 03:18:22.107]  How it was actually Kissinger and Alexander Haig that were the brains behind ruining the Nixon administration.
[03:18:22.587 --> 03:18:29.788]  But when Nixon went to China, that was actually already organized and prepared via Henry Kissinger and David Rockefeller.
[03:18:29.808 --> 03:18:43.691]  They'd already gone over this whole chapter in Rockefeller's memoirs on how he wanted to set up Chase Bank in communist China, and that he loves communism and socialism because that allows for there to only be one central bank, the Chase Bank.
[03:18:44.624 --> 03:18:49.107]  In any country that's communist or absolutely socialist and centralized in that way.
[03:18:49.608 --> 03:18:59.494]  So these are high-level key operatives that were involved in not just things like maneuvering and organizing big trade deals like OPEC.
[03:18:59.514 --> 03:19:10.342]  It was actually Kissinger, according to Eflin Ingdahl, that was behind the OPEC oil embargo and the 70s oil crisis that was all masterminded by Kissinger and Bilderberg.
[03:19:11.621 --> 03:19:16.783]  Well, again, a lot of people don't know the deep black ops background to Henry Kissinger.
[03:19:16.803 --> 03:19:21.624]  And the reason I'm bringing that up is that there's this public sort of normie perspective that people have.
[03:19:21.744 --> 03:19:29.467]  Oh, he was a great engineer of getting us into detente and solving the Cold War.
[03:19:29.487 --> 03:19:34.629]  And he helped open up China and all this normie nonsense that has nothing to do with what was really going on.
[03:19:35.289 --> 03:19:38.410]  Because Kissinger was actually a mega high level black ops operator.
[03:19:38.430 --> 03:19:40.571]  He was running, according to Paul Williams and
[03:19:41.423 --> 03:19:47.507]  The Daniel Ganser PhD thesis on Gladio, it was really Kissinger that was running Gladio, right?
[03:19:47.567 --> 03:19:52.210]  And so you might think, well, but we had to do that to fight the Soviets and the Communists.
[03:19:53.091 --> 03:20:02.077]  But I'm going to let you in on a little secret that Kissinger, who a lot of times the global elites, as they get towards the end of their life, they start to reveal things.
[03:20:02.798 --> 03:20:09.322]  And I know that they played, Alex played the clip this week of Kissinger saying that we didn't know that opening up the borders would
[03:20:11.857 --> 03:20:12.638]  What do you mean you didn't know it?
[03:20:12.658 --> 03:20:13.278]  Of course you knew it.
[03:20:13.338 --> 03:20:19.523]  You're the master architect of studying population control and population management for the last hundred years.
[03:20:19.603 --> 03:20:24.767]  I mean, of course you knew what was going to happen by having completely open borders in Europe and in Germany, right?
[03:20:25.647 --> 03:20:34.174]  So, but why he says that, I don't know, maybe he was getting a little, you know, flippant in his words and he accidentally let that out.
[03:20:35.336 --> 03:20:46.705]  But he also accidentally let out at the end of his, I don't know if he accidentally let it out, but at the end of his last book, World Order, which that's a helpful title here that helps you know what he's talking about.
[03:20:47.405 --> 03:20:58.053]  I mean, again, we live in an era where there's still people who don't think there's such a thing as the New World Order or a world government, even though Henry Kissinger actually writes books on how to run the world in world order.
[03:20:58.534 --> 03:21:02.737]  The very end of the book, very telling last chapter, he says that
[03:21:04.687 --> 03:21:10.390]  Past empires would run through a sort of unilateral policy, right, like ancient Chinese empire.
[03:21:10.410 --> 03:21:16.214]  They would want to have everybody submitting to the Chinese empire or whatever other empire.
[03:21:16.254 --> 03:21:27.781]  He says that the difference in today's world, at least I guess out of the Cold War is what he's speaking of here particularly, says that we've learned that the best way to manage and control the world is to have
[03:21:28.722 --> 03:21:31.204]  Uh, a dual balanced opposition.
[03:21:31.584 --> 03:21:33.365]  So, dialectical opposition.
[03:21:33.605 --> 03:21:35.246]  This is like the last page of the book.
[03:21:36.226 --> 03:21:46.792]  And he says that's a much better way to manage and contain and control the world because this allows for there to be a dialectic that people are always sort of focused on.
[03:21:47.813 --> 03:21:55.097]  And so balance of powers is actually a dialectical Hegelian and you could argue in Marxist philosophy.
[03:21:56.498 --> 03:21:57.979]  I mean, Hegelianism precedes Marx.
[03:21:58.775 --> 03:22:00.896]  Hegel was the key influence on Marx.
[03:22:00.976 --> 03:22:03.337]  Marx was a young Hegelian when he was a student.
[03:22:04.878 --> 03:22:18.344]  And so you can see that today's power elite, and especially David Rockefeller himself, being very interested in and very influenced by both Austrian economics, studying under von Hayek and being interested in and studying under Harold Lasky,
[03:22:18.729 --> 03:22:19.290]  We're good to go.
[03:22:39.508 --> 03:22:47.630]  And so even when he was an undergrad, Kissinger wrote his undergraduate thesis on Toynbee, the British baby and socialist operative.
[03:22:48.110 --> 03:22:56.071]  Immanuel Kant, the Enlightenment philosopher who wrote a whole essay on how to have global government, and he's actually, Kant's actually the key influence on Hegel.
[03:22:56.851 --> 03:23:06.393]  And he wrote on Oswald Spengler, right, the Prussian theorist of how civilizations have life cycles.
[03:23:07.026 --> 03:23:14.973]  So even as an undergraduate, Kissinger was very familiar with both philosophy and geopolitics and the relationship between the two.
[03:23:16.214 --> 03:23:21.598]  And so he took a lot of that into how he would strategize for the power elite.
[03:23:22.398 --> 03:23:28.203]  And it's really important to talk about him because I think that aside from Brzezinski, there's no other
[03:23:29.728 --> 03:23:34.589]  Brain in this power structure more important than Henry Kissinger.
[03:23:34.929 --> 03:23:41.511]  Between Kissinger and Brzezinski, I mean, they're pretty much up there at the top running things for the wealthy families.
[03:23:41.711 --> 03:23:42.971]  So that's pretty much how it works.
[03:23:43.571 --> 03:23:53.573]  And so to think that we don't live under a deep state, which is utterly preposterous, when these deep state people actually write freaking books about the deep state for everybody to read, it's just absurd.
[03:23:54.333 --> 03:23:57.374]  But rewinding and getting back to some of this
[03:23:59.213 --> 03:24:08.600]  Some of the scandals that Kissinger's known for, and partly why he's, I mean, you know, everybody's probably familiar with him being considered a war criminal.
[03:24:08.680 --> 03:24:13.663]  I think he's, you know, he couldn't go to certain countries supposedly because they call him a war criminal or something like that.
[03:24:14.684 --> 03:24:22.530]  But he's considered a war criminal for, by some people, for the bombing of Cambodia, as well as involvement in the 1973 Chilean coup.
[03:24:25.103 --> 03:24:30.309]  And again, a lot of people, a lot of neoconservatives thought, well, but see, he's opposing the Soviets.
[03:24:30.389 --> 03:24:36.455]  But if you look at what he actually says about detente and about balance of powers, never about opposing the Soviets.
[03:24:36.495 --> 03:24:38.497]  It was about having a balance of powers.
[03:24:39.118 --> 03:24:41.120]  A balance doesn't mean you beat the enemy.
[03:24:41.160 --> 03:24:43.102]  It means that you balance them, you help them out, you aid them.
[03:24:43.142 --> 03:24:46.526]  And that's why he's a key figure for understanding dialectics.
[03:24:47.165 --> 03:24:57.467]  And understanding that the world order was always about having a counterbalance of China and or Russia or Eurasia against the West.
[03:24:58.327 --> 03:25:04.168]  And so that's why Kissinger had all those comments about how China would be the future of the new world order.
[03:25:05.088 --> 03:25:05.328]  Right.
[03:25:05.469 --> 03:25:06.309]  China is really the future.
[03:25:06.329 --> 03:25:13.210]  Well, that's because his masters, his his handlers were the ones that had decided a long time ago to build up China.
[03:25:14.142 --> 03:25:23.104]  I mean, if you go to Arkansas, which that's where Walmart's home offices are, I mean, that's the Rockefeller State.
[03:25:23.124 --> 03:25:26.565]  I mean, you go to Arkansas, it's the Rockefeller State, literally.
[03:25:26.705 --> 03:25:27.725]  That's like their home state.
[03:25:28.445 --> 03:25:29.406]  Rockefeller stuff everywhere.
[03:25:29.426 --> 03:25:32.666]  I think Nelson, I think, was the governor of Arkansas at one point.
[03:25:34.027 --> 03:25:39.468]  I mean, you also find Bill and Hillary Clinton stuff everywhere, because Bill Clinton comes from Arkansas.
[03:25:41.186 --> 03:25:43.367]  So who was picking presidents back in that time?
[03:25:43.587 --> 03:25:46.687]  Oh, Henry Kissinger and Bilderberg were picking the president, right?
[03:25:46.707 --> 03:25:52.929]  I mean, Kissinger is one of the mainstays of Bilderberg for decades at all the Bilderberg meetings.
[03:25:53.829 --> 03:26:01.310]  And of course, it was Bilderberg that chose Jimmy Carter, and it was Bilderberg that chose Bill Clinton.
[03:26:01.491 --> 03:26:02.431]  Who picks the president?
[03:26:02.831 --> 03:26:03.351]  The elections?
[03:26:03.391 --> 03:26:03.691]  No, no, no.
[03:26:04.372 --> 03:26:05.632]  The power elite.
[03:26:05.712 --> 03:26:07.533]  And they tend to prefer the Democrats especially.
[03:26:07.573 --> 03:26:13.475]  Now that doesn't mean you can't have neoconservative, you know, so-called fake conservatives.
[03:26:13.515 --> 03:26:18.536]  I mean, Reagan, for example, attempted to talk about trilateral commission, the CFR, and all that.
[03:26:18.576 --> 03:26:20.137]  And we saw what happened with Reagan.
[03:26:20.377 --> 03:26:31.040]  I think a lot of people think that Bush Sr., who formerly was running the CIA for a year, he had a hand in putting Ronald Reagan in line when Ronald Reagan stepped out of
[03:26:31.807 --> 03:26:36.531]  Out of bounds, and then we didn't really see Reagan going against the real power elite after that.
[03:26:37.092 --> 03:26:39.254]  So when you start talking about those real power elite...
[03:26:40.512 --> 03:26:41.612]  You get Reagan, right?
[03:26:41.652 --> 03:26:44.853]  And I think Alex is right to talk about, you know, the dangers for Trump.
[03:26:44.893 --> 03:26:51.675]  If you cross a certain lines, there's a lot of dangers that the power elite might roll out another kind of dangerous situation, right?
[03:26:51.695 --> 03:26:52.816]  That's what they do.
[03:26:53.376 --> 03:27:00.578]  And it's people like Kissinger, in my view, from my research, that organized and made a lot of those shot calls, right?
[03:27:00.638 --> 03:27:05.819]  I mean, I've been interviewing Sammy the Bull Gravano for the last few months on his podcast, The Famous Gangster.
[03:27:06.059 --> 03:27:07.300]  He was the shot caller, right?
[03:27:07.340 --> 03:27:07.940]  He's the one that
[03:27:08.542 --> 03:27:15.725]  When John Gotti told him who to take out, you know, Sammy the Bull would organize the hit and figure out how to take him out.
[03:27:16.425 --> 03:27:18.786]  So this is all real world stuff.
[03:27:19.426 --> 03:27:29.290]  And then when we go back, even before the publicly known stuff, most people think, oh, well, Kissinger's, you know, involved in Cambodia or something like that.
[03:27:29.310 --> 03:27:30.170]  Well, that's all true.
[03:27:30.230 --> 03:27:34.532]  But before that, he was he was actually, according to Paul Williams, running Gladio.
[03:27:34.732 --> 03:27:38.213]  And there's actually a whole section in the Ganser book
[03:27:39.015 --> 03:27:40.936]  Of how Kissinger was doing it.
[03:27:40.996 --> 03:27:42.417]  He was the one calling the shots.
[03:27:42.757 --> 03:28:00.787]  It was Kissinger that had made the connection with the highest P2 Mason in Italy, Licio Gelli, who was the basically running the Italian government through all of this sexual compromise and blackmail and other operations in the Italian government in the 1940s and 50s.
[03:28:01.627 --> 03:28:06.290]  And so Kissinger basically coddled and invited Licio Gelli
[03:28:06.883 --> 03:28:09.264]  To the US, they wined him and dined him.
[03:28:09.884 --> 03:28:20.687]  And through this means, Kissinger was pretty much able to run Italy, and by extension, the rest of Europe, because the US has always really called the shots when it comes to the EU.
[03:28:20.707 --> 03:28:25.109]  In fact, the EU was the creation of Bilderberg and the OSS and the CIA.
[03:28:26.014 --> 03:28:26.894]  And that's on record.
[03:28:27.034 --> 03:28:38.378]  Wasn't... I mean, there were similar plans drawn up by Tiny Mustache Man, by Hitler, but it was actually the OSS and the CIA that put into place the European project that would become what we know of as the EU.
[03:28:38.618 --> 03:28:54.524]  And Kissinger, again, key player in the background of a lot of these operations, but particularly these black ops, sabotage, assassination, false flag operations of Gladio to save Europe from a supposed Soviet invasion.
[03:28:55.069 --> 03:28:56.450]  Don't go anywhere, this is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:29:14.168 --> 03:29:16.951]  So many people have serious issues.
[03:29:17.231 --> 03:29:18.352]  Look at the UN's own numbers.
[03:29:18.793 --> 03:29:24.218]  Billions have cognitive disabilities because they do not have true nascent iodine in their bodies.
[03:29:24.758 --> 03:29:30.163]  Most of the other iodine is bound to other heavy metals or bound to other elements so you don't download it.
[03:29:30.784 --> 03:29:33.546]  But this is pure atomic certified
[03:29:35.339 --> 03:29:38.100]  Where were you when humanity was fighting for its life?
[03:30:01.792 --> 03:30:06.316]  Where were you when the globalists were caught trafficking millions of children for sex slavery worldwide?
[03:30:06.956 --> 03:30:09.899]  Where were you when the New World Order was starting World War III with Russia?
[03:30:10.419 --> 03:30:11.120]  Well, I know where you are.
[03:30:11.480 --> 03:30:15.443]  You're watching and listening to Infowars.com right now, and I salute you and thank you.

[03:30:22.569 --> 03:30:22.809]  I think?
[03:30:38.045 --> 03:30:38.666]  We're good to go.
[03:30:56.912 --> 03:31:04.939]  We have not had this many of our best-selling products back in stock in years because of supply chain breakdowns and all the rest of the stuff that's gone on.
[03:31:05.179 --> 03:31:06.540]  And these are game-changing products.
[03:31:06.560 --> 03:31:08.461]  It's like our information's game-changing.
[03:31:08.481 --> 03:31:09.702]  These products are incredible.

[03:31:26.203 --> 03:31:28.625]  We've got 3 or 4,000 bottles of each one of these.

[03:32:58.331 --> 03:33:04.236]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:13.655 --> 03:33:14.516]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:14.536 --> 03:33:25.223]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jace Analysis, and we're talking about one of the key game players, one of the key chess masters of global geopolitics, like Brzezinski, Henry Kissinger, who just passed away.
[03:33:25.243 --> 03:33:38.713]  And it's really important to understand his life and his operations, because it's a window into how the Deep State and the New World Order actually works with one of their key, well-known public figures, who was himself an operative, a brain,
[03:33:39.369 --> 03:33:43.810]  For the Bloods, the Blue Bloods and the Power Elite, the Banking Elite, etc.
[03:33:45.451 --> 03:33:56.874]  He really recruited and coaxed Henry into this high-level operation where he would be in charge of implementing so many of the plans of the Power Elite.
[03:33:57.434 --> 03:34:01.675]  In fact, I just finished lecturing through, as you guys know, Dr. John Coleman's book, Committee of 300.
[03:34:02.865 --> 03:34:11.017]  And Coleman actually begins the book, as I think about it, way ahead of the other researchers like Ganser or Paul Williams on Gladio.
[03:34:12.066 --> 03:34:26.016]  Dr. John Coleman actually said back then, in the very first chapter, that it was Kissinger that was running Gladio, utilizing the networks of the P-Lodges to do all of the, you know, the false flags, the assassinations, the scare tactics, the strategy of tension.
[03:34:26.476 --> 03:34:31.280]  That was a big part of the neocon Cold War operations against the Soviets.
[03:34:31.320 --> 03:34:36.423]  Remember, it wasn't a Western free market capitalism versus Soviet war.
[03:34:36.503 --> 03:34:38.805]  That was the, that's the fake version of it.
[03:34:38.845 --> 03:34:40.326]  The real war was
[03:34:40.806 --> 03:35:07.463]  Fabian socialism versus sovietism and it was actually the Fabian socialist of the West which is the alliance of Marxism and monopoly capital that ended up Winning that Cold War and then in turn in the last several decades helping to prop up Deindustrialize the West and to create this balance of powers of China and again Kissinger was it was forever talking about how important China would be and
[03:35:07.927 --> 03:35:14.030]  It was Kissinger and David Rockefeller that went to China and really opened it up to the West to set up this policy.
[03:35:14.390 --> 03:35:21.974]  And again, you heard last week Roger Stone and Alex talking about how that was really something that they forced Nixon into.
[03:35:22.034 --> 03:35:27.697]  And then they double-crossed Nixon, Kissinger, and Haig by doing the entire Watergate stuff.
[03:35:28.078 --> 03:35:35.461]  John Coleman also had said that Kissinger and others were really the players behind Watergate back in the 1990s.
[03:35:37.512 --> 03:35:53.799]  But Coleman was very ahead of his time in talking about Kissinger really running with people from the Club of Rome, the Committee of 300, that's the highest 300 power players in the world, basically modeled on the old British Imperial or the British East India Company's top 300 advisors, right?
[03:35:53.819 --> 03:36:00.863]  So the British East India Company used to have this Committee of 300, ran it when it was the most powerful corporation in the world.
[03:36:00.903 --> 03:36:03.304]  It dominated anything.
[03:36:03.324 --> 03:36:06.305]  It is way bigger than even Apple for its time.
[03:36:06.994 --> 03:36:08.175]  And I did a whole talk on that.
[03:36:08.195 --> 03:36:15.778]  You can go watch the whole history of the Illuminati drug trade lecture that I did here on the fourth hour a few weeks ago or maybe a couple months ago.
[03:36:16.459 --> 03:36:31.726]  So we're talking about Kissinger's black ops operations and it was really Kissinger that was the mastermind with others in the CIA like Ted Theodore Shackley, James Jesus Angleton, in terms of how to strategize utilizing the Roman Catholic Church and the Vatican Bank.
[03:36:32.583 --> 03:36:53.752]  And so when you get deep into Gladio and the whole scandal of the Vatican Bank in the 1960s and 70s, this was actually, again, Kissinger in the background, going to the Vatican and setting up with people like William Colby these deals where the Vatican Bank, because it's the most secretive bank in the world, it would be a funnel for funding CIA black ops.
[03:36:53.972 --> 03:37:01.575]  And so the Vatican Bank played a key role in arms trafficking, drugs trafficking throughout that Gladio period to fund Gladio, right?
[03:37:02.105 --> 03:37:04.487]  And again, I'm not saying everything's Gladio.
[03:37:04.527 --> 03:37:08.109]  It's just one of these key elements into how the New World Order runs things.
[03:37:08.189 --> 03:37:13.272]  How the Club of Rome, Committee of 300, Kissinger Associates, how these people call these shots.
[03:37:14.533 --> 03:37:14.693]  Right?
[03:37:14.713 --> 03:37:17.755]  And so let's say, you know, David Rockefeller wants to do this.
[03:37:18.156 --> 03:37:23.239]  He says, Henry, I'm going to put you in charge of doing blah, blah, blah.
[03:37:23.279 --> 03:37:25.220]  Yes, Master, I will do what you command.
[03:37:25.240 --> 03:37:25.360]  Right?
[03:37:25.400 --> 03:37:26.501]  This is what Henry Kissinger would do.
[03:37:26.521 --> 03:37:27.402]  He would put it into play.
[03:37:28.162 --> 03:37:30.924]  And again, there's probably no other figure other than Brzezinski that's
[03:37:31.514 --> 03:37:32.775]  So important in this regard.
[03:37:33.736 --> 03:37:36.337]  And again, it includes all these black operations.
[03:37:36.357 --> 03:37:43.763]  I mean, Gladio is its own amazing rabbit trail to go down to see all these connections and how deep it goes with the Vatican.
[03:37:43.883 --> 03:37:45.664]  He said, well, why is this a big deal?
[03:37:45.684 --> 03:37:46.665]  Don't we have to beat the Soviets?
[03:37:46.685 --> 03:37:49.407]  We're not just beating Soviets for free markets.
[03:37:50.287 --> 03:37:57.332]  You're beating Soviets to create the new dialectical synthesis out of that, which is where we are nowadays.
[03:37:57.813 --> 03:37:58.393]  Again, with
[03:37:58.956 --> 03:38:00.596]  Russia, China.
[03:38:00.736 --> 03:38:11.699]  I'm not saying that China particularly isn't dangerous to the West, but the power elites in the West built up China on purpose to create, as Kissinger says, this balance of powers.
[03:38:12.720 --> 03:38:14.080]  Why would we want balance of powers?
[03:38:14.120 --> 03:38:17.761]  Well, he argues that it's more pragmatic for running and controlling the world.
[03:38:18.979 --> 03:38:22.460]  But it's also for a long-term plan of where they want to take things.
[03:38:22.761 --> 03:38:29.043]  And that's where I want to go next, because in the 1970s, when Kissinger writes State Department memorandum, he didn't just come up with that.
[03:38:30.044 --> 03:38:34.986]  He's again working for the Rockefeller Malthusian Dysgenics Operatives.
[03:38:35.266 --> 03:38:39.568]  He's implementing their plans into government policy.
[03:38:41.488 --> 03:38:47.611]  And that happens particularly under Carter, and then more gets pushed in subsequent administrations, right?
[03:38:48.444 --> 03:38:54.709]  And so they sent to Carter this report, this Global 2000, and it wasn't written in 2000, obviously it was 1975.
[03:38:55.429 --> 03:39:15.724]  The Global 2000 report was one of these Club of Rome created documents with Kissinger, with Marie Strong and all these characters saying that if we don't put into place radical depopulation and deindustrialization agendas, we will not have enough food and resources in the West.
[03:39:16.265 --> 03:39:17.986]  The third world will like, you know,
[03:39:18.996 --> 03:39:21.056]  Explode a population and then we won't have any food.
[03:39:21.937 --> 03:39:25.857]  Because Thomas Malthus had flies in a jar and there wasn't enough food.
[03:39:25.877 --> 03:39:28.158]  That's literally like the origins of all this, right?
[03:39:29.518 --> 03:39:37.939]  But that's the basis for where we are now with the meeting that just happened with COP28.
[03:39:38.740 --> 03:39:46.421]  So COP28 is the essence of this whole deindustrialization, shut down production, destroy the West agenda.
[03:39:47.324 --> 03:39:49.225]  To create the balance of powers, right?
[03:39:49.745 --> 03:40:02.031]  So, China would never have been some great power in the world had not the West shipped all of its production elsewhere, by design, helped to build up these foreign powers.
[03:40:02.091 --> 03:40:05.932]  That's the nature of this game, and that's what most people don't understand that level of this game.
[03:40:06.513 --> 03:40:10.334]  Building up and containing your dialectical opposition.
[03:40:10.454 --> 03:40:13.916]  It's a form of controlled opposition, but on a much grander scale.
[03:40:18.536 --> 03:40:24.920]  And so Kissinger was pushing all these agendas that again really helped to set the U.S.
[03:40:25.461 --> 03:40:30.604]  policy to be an official eugenics policy, but it's no longer called that.
[03:40:30.644 --> 03:40:32.405]  It's just the depopulation agenda.
[03:40:32.425 --> 03:40:47.014]  So when Tucker's talking about the death cult, which is absolutely correct, you can't find anybody more archetypal of implementing this death cult, especially in the 1970s, than Kissinger.
[03:40:48.533 --> 03:40:54.336]  It was a key decade for pushing this, again, right after, not too long after Roe versus Wade, right?
[03:40:55.136 --> 03:40:57.918]  Again, all pushed and promoted by Rockefeller interests.
[03:41:00.539 --> 03:41:02.660]  And so, what was Kissinger saying then?
[03:41:02.760 --> 03:41:08.583]  We've got to control and stop third world production to keep them down.
[03:41:09.724 --> 03:41:17.928]  And the only thing that's changed is that now that third world quote-unquote strategy, which, like Alex always said, it was always going to be turned domestically,
[03:41:18.493 --> 03:41:20.034]  Now it's all just turned domestically.
[03:41:20.635 --> 03:41:21.856]  Not so much about the third world.
[03:41:22.476 --> 03:41:26.520]  It's how do we stop Western civilization and crush the U.S.
[03:41:27.381 --> 03:41:32.425]  because that's the one sort of roadblock to moving into the full-on New World Order.
[03:41:33.746 --> 03:41:35.147]  And so there's phases to this, right?
[03:41:35.187 --> 03:41:40.532]  So the balance of powers, that's a phase until they're ready for the synthesis of these two oppositions.
[03:41:41.292 --> 03:41:45.055]  The whole system, it all works on the thesis, antithesis, synthesis, everything.
[03:41:45.135 --> 03:41:45.676]  That's the whole thing.
[03:41:46.311 --> 03:41:51.012]  And that's why when you read Brzezinski, he talks about the Manichaean dialectic of the Cold War.
[03:41:53.053 --> 03:41:58.795]  When you read Kissinger, he talks about the dialectic of the controlled opposition of balance of powers.
[03:42:00.195 --> 03:42:05.517]  But there's a synthesis that occurs out of this smashing of the oppositions together.
[03:42:06.037 --> 03:42:11.179]  And that's just basic dialectical philosophy that goes all the way back to Heraclitus in the ancient world.
[03:42:11.979 --> 03:42:15.420]  Plato talks about it all the way up until, I mean, Darwin.
[03:42:16.232 --> 03:42:17.213]  All the way up into Marx.
[03:42:17.333 --> 03:42:18.073]  Marx talks about it.
[03:42:18.234 --> 03:42:19.455]  Marxism is dialectics.
[03:42:20.716 --> 03:42:26.380]  And then the application of that strategy and technology to geopolitics through people like Henry Kissinger.
[03:42:28.482 --> 03:42:44.334]  And so Kissinger pushes all this austerity and that becomes a policy after many, many decades of propaganda and movies and pop culture and mainstream media to where we are now, to where
[03:42:44.952 --> 03:42:45.993]  It's all domestic.
[03:42:46.053 --> 03:42:47.014]  It's all pushed on us.
[03:42:47.254 --> 03:42:48.315]  It's all the same stuff.
[03:42:49.416 --> 03:42:54.500]  Disney promoting Trans Agenda, that's not out of nowhere.
[03:42:54.780 --> 03:42:56.281]  It's all this same policy.
[03:42:56.321 --> 03:42:57.182]  It's one plan.
[03:42:59.023 --> 03:43:00.965]  And even the big wars are part of that same plan.
[03:43:02.766 --> 03:43:07.530]  So when you hear about GMO meat that the Global League push,
[03:43:08.183 --> 03:43:08.863]  Get rid of cows.
[03:43:08.883 --> 03:43:10.104]  We've got to kill the cows.
[03:43:10.744 --> 03:43:15.386]  Ireland is talking about killing 100-200,000 cows because it's destroying the environment.
[03:43:15.966 --> 03:43:21.388]  And if you read the Yahoo article on it, it actually says that we have to kill the cows because the cows are a threat to their own existence.
[03:43:23.329 --> 03:43:23.569]  What?
[03:43:24.369 --> 03:43:24.609]  Yes.
[03:43:25.170 --> 03:43:26.250]  Welcome to Orwell Land.
[03:43:26.510 --> 03:43:28.211]  It's like total contradiction.
[03:43:28.691 --> 03:43:36.794]  Well, to save the cows, we've got to kill the cows because they are a danger to their own existence because of what Alex is talking about with John Kerry, right?
[03:43:38.459 --> 03:43:40.581]  And his farting it up at the COP 28.
[03:43:43.683 --> 03:43:50.329]  Now, it's all one plan and you say, well, why does COP 28 matter?
[03:43:50.769 --> 03:43:55.533]  This is the exact same stuff that they did in the 1992 Rio Earth Summit.
[03:43:56.053 --> 03:43:59.976]  You go back and watch that at C-SPAN, you can watch the hearings and the presentations.
[03:44:00.477 --> 03:44:05.781]  Bush Sr., Marie Strong, they're all sitting there saying the exact same thing that they're saying at COP 28.
[03:44:06.542 --> 03:44:07.743]  That greenhouse gases,
[03:44:08.735 --> 03:44:09.715]  All this nonsense.
[03:44:10.056 --> 03:44:10.916]  It's all going to kill us.
[03:44:10.936 --> 03:44:13.417]  We're all going to die in the next 15-20 years.
[03:44:13.437 --> 03:44:14.778]  And they always say the next 15-20 years.
[03:44:14.798 --> 03:44:17.499]  That's why it was global warming.
[03:44:17.899 --> 03:44:20.481]  Actually, in the 1970s, it was the coming Ice Age.
[03:44:20.581 --> 03:44:22.482]  It was going to be a new Ice Age.
[03:44:23.322 --> 03:44:27.984]  And then they changed the PR to the hole in the ozone layer and greenhouse gases.
[03:44:28.164 --> 03:44:30.165]  And then they changed the PR to global warming.
[03:44:30.686 --> 03:44:32.547]  And then they rebranded it to climate change.
[03:44:32.767 --> 03:44:34.247]  Because that encompasses everything.
[03:44:34.428 --> 03:44:36.388]  Oh, the temperature went up three degrees today.
[03:44:36.449 --> 03:44:37.409]  Oh, that's climate change.
[03:44:38.228 --> 03:44:39.348]  As if the climate doesn't change.
[03:44:40.789 --> 03:44:42.370]  So it's really just a giant scam.
[03:44:43.110 --> 03:44:53.334]  And what you really learn is that I think that that's the intelligence angle of this, because a lot of people think like intelligence work is like, oh, it's spies and James Bond saving the country and Queen and country.
[03:44:53.934 --> 03:44:55.214]  Actually, it's a bunch of con men.
[03:44:55.675 --> 03:44:58.776]  It's mastering the con at a higher and higher level.
[03:44:59.656 --> 03:45:00.476]  That's a big part of it.
[03:45:00.617 --> 03:45:01.757]  That and human compromise.
[03:45:02.563 --> 03:45:11.288]  And so when you look at Gladio, for example, and you see that gigantic portions of the Italian government throughout that time period, those decades, they were all sexually compromised.
[03:45:11.989 --> 03:45:14.790]  I wonder if Kissinger was running that?
[03:45:14.810 --> 03:45:20.414]  I mean, nobody's talking about Kissinger basically being in charge of giant, you know, Epstein-style operations.
[03:45:20.434 --> 03:45:25.697]  I haven't heard any of that in the glowing praises and eulogies of
[03:45:26.923 --> 03:45:28.083]  Of Kissinger in the last week.
[03:45:28.584 --> 03:45:38.867]  What about the Epstein style operations to control and compromise, not just the Italian government, but the Roman Catholic Church in Italy throughout the Gladio period?
[03:45:40.808 --> 03:45:41.188]  Interesting.
[03:45:41.568 --> 03:45:48.791]  I wonder, where have we seen something like that in recent times, the compromise of the Roman Catholic Church?
[03:45:49.111 --> 03:45:52.052]  Oh, like exactly what happens now.
[03:45:52.632 --> 03:45:54.493]  And this was all, for example, rumored when
[03:45:55.307 --> 03:46:16.220]  Benedict the 16th step down that he was sort of cajoled into that because so much clergy compromise particularly the powerful clerics don't care about some random priest some other place but and by the way Archbishop Viganu is actually saying all the same stuff that you've heard me say so it's not just me it's not just this is well-known stuff
[03:46:17.270 --> 03:46:28.521]  But Kissinger is another example, just like Robert Maxwell, the father of Ghislaine Maxwell, big time international player during the Cold War, playing both sides of the Cold War.
[03:46:29.101 --> 03:46:31.824]  Henry Kissinger, you could argue, was doing similar types of things.
[03:46:34.186 --> 03:46:42.414]  And especially if you look at Gladio and how that whole architecture of Gladio was structured through sexual, black male compromise.
[03:46:43.155 --> 03:46:49.599]  And utilizing international secretive banks like the Vatican Bank to fund and do black ops.
[03:46:50.640 --> 03:46:51.580]  This is all on record.
[03:46:51.600 --> 03:46:53.201]  This all came out.
[03:46:53.261 --> 03:46:54.562]  I was doing some podcasts.
[03:46:54.582 --> 03:46:55.863]  People had still never even heard of Gladio.
[03:46:55.883 --> 03:46:56.983]  They don't even know what this stuff is.
[03:46:57.003 --> 03:46:58.404]  They've never heard of the Vatican Bank scandal.
[03:46:59.205 --> 03:47:04.368]  I mean, these are key windows into how this whole architecture of the New World Order works.
[03:47:05.228 --> 03:47:09.971]  And that's why when we look at the life of Kissinger, I mean, there's probably no better, I mean,
[03:47:10.849 --> 03:47:14.072]  We've seen multiple of these guys die in the last few years.
[03:47:14.312 --> 03:47:15.473]  We saw Brzezinski die.
[03:47:15.493 --> 03:47:18.516]  We saw David Rockefeller die a few years ago.
[03:47:18.556 --> 03:47:21.759]  We saw Henry Kissinger die just recently.
[03:47:21.859 --> 03:47:23.460]  Charlie Munger, another one of these guys.
[03:47:23.480 --> 03:47:28.565]  I mean, these are all people on the same game plan, you see.
[03:47:28.985 --> 03:47:30.887]  That's why they always push the same stuff.
[03:47:32.428 --> 03:47:34.570]  And they're above government, okay?
[03:47:35.196 --> 03:47:37.616]  It's not just Joe Biden's incompetent.
[03:47:38.137 --> 03:47:40.137]  We're going to get rid of Biden.
[03:47:40.177 --> 03:47:41.737]  Yeah, but what about Henry Kissinger?
[03:47:43.298 --> 03:47:52.800]  Well, I know Henry Kissinger's gone, but what I'm saying is that the next Henry Kissinger, whoever that's going to be, maybe we can hope that at least Henry Kissinger was a competent evil genius.
[03:47:53.280 --> 03:47:57.020]  So maybe we can hope that the next generation is basically just going to be a bunch of retarded people, right?
[03:47:57.060 --> 03:47:58.141]  Then they won't be able to function.
[03:47:58.161 --> 03:47:59.521]  So maybe the next generation
[03:47:59.861 --> 03:48:04.964]  And actually Kissinger talks about in his book that they would be handing this over to the tech elite, right?
[03:48:05.424 --> 03:48:08.006]  Remember Bilderberg about five, six, seven years ago?
[03:48:08.446 --> 03:48:16.391]  They were saying, all right, it's time for these old geriatric goblins, David Rockefeller, Henry Kissinger, we're going to hand this over to the Silicon Valley overlords.
[03:48:17.111 --> 03:48:22.715]  And they were saying, we're basically passing the baton to the tech elite because their time has come.
[03:48:24.033 --> 03:48:33.078]  So maybe they think that a bunch of, you know, insane techspergs, you know, dosing, micro-dosing LSD or whatever can run the New World Order.
[03:48:33.158 --> 03:48:33.559]  I don't know.
[03:48:33.799 --> 03:48:40.563]  Or maybe they think that AI is, you know, sufficient enough that the AI Skynet system will run the New World Order.
[03:48:40.603 --> 03:48:43.704]  We don't have to have somebody as competent as a Kissinger.
[03:48:44.165 --> 03:48:44.365]  But
[03:48:46.015 --> 03:48:55.662]  Again, you know, if you're looking for perfect proof for all the stuff that we talked about for so many years, a good example, you need to look no further than Henry Kissinger.
[03:48:56.923 --> 03:49:01.707]  And again, where do we get the COP28, the Davos?
[03:49:01.747 --> 03:49:03.048]  Where does that stuff come from?
[03:49:03.188 --> 03:49:04.409]  How does this arise?
[03:49:05.270 --> 03:49:08.412]  Who ever thought up the World Economic Forum and Davos?
[03:49:09.032 --> 03:49:09.733]  Well, guess who?
[03:49:10.253 --> 03:49:11.194]  Henry Kissinger, that's who.
[03:49:11.841 --> 03:49:20.963]  It was the CIA and Henry Kissinger and the Harvard Research Project, which produced the World Economic Forum.
[03:49:21.483 --> 03:49:25.964]  Did you know the World Economic Forum is actually a Kissinger-CIA Rockefeller operation?
[03:49:26.765 --> 03:49:27.145]  Shocker.
[03:49:28.725 --> 03:49:29.305]  Absolutely.
[03:49:29.445 --> 03:49:38.968]  And not only that, we know that, of course, Klaus used to be at Bilderberg and then Klaus went on to be the main guy, the main Bond villain over at WEF.
[03:49:42.391 --> 03:49:48.215]  Again, these are all steering committees created by the same people, the same power structure.
[03:49:48.495 --> 03:49:50.436]  Most people don't know that that was a CIA operation.
[03:49:53.918 --> 03:50:03.604]  So again, this is a great window into understanding full-spectrum dominance, understanding this attitude of our actual shadow government.
[03:50:04.365 --> 03:50:07.286]  And I'm really amazed at John Coleman's Committee 300 because
[03:50:10.760 --> 03:50:14.443]  It's like, I just read the book, you know, again, I'd read it many years ago.
[03:50:14.483 --> 03:50:20.987]  I read it again and I was blown away at how he's basically 99, 95% right on everything, right?
[03:50:21.027 --> 03:50:23.969]  I mean, he's Alex level predicting the future stuff.
[03:50:24.709 --> 03:50:34.256]  So I think that, you know, he has some detractors, but I think that vindicates the book because basically everything that he said about what we would expect to see by 2010, 2020, 2030, pretty much has rolled out.
[03:50:37.990 --> 03:50:40.071]  And it's not because John Coleman had a crystal ball.
[03:50:40.111 --> 03:50:42.311]  It's because most of the stuff was in their books.
[03:50:43.011 --> 03:50:54.975]  Most of this stuff is written about, and most of this stuff is done not at the government level, but at the steering committee, super international committee power structure level.
[03:50:55.275 --> 03:50:55.495]  Right?
[03:50:55.595 --> 03:51:01.256]  And that's why people like Alex have been so instrumental in calling attention to that through Bohemian Grove.
[03:51:01.696 --> 03:51:03.657]  Again, one of these international confabs.
[03:51:04.341 --> 03:51:12.206]  All the years covering Bilderberg, you know, calling attention to World Economic Forum in Davos, years before it was in the mainstream.
[03:51:12.787 --> 03:51:21.032]  People really only paid attention to WEF and Klaus after the COVID nonsense and then really spearheading that scandemic.
[03:51:21.592 --> 03:51:24.274]  But, I mean, World Economic Forum in Davos have been here for a long time.
[03:51:24.494 --> 03:51:27.476]  They've been having these meetings for a long time, pushing all the same stuff.
[03:51:30.318 --> 03:51:31.839]  And it's not just about pushing
[03:51:32.580 --> 03:51:33.520]  Getting rid of cars.
[03:51:33.560 --> 03:51:37.642]  Did you see that in New York, they're going to start charging people to go to work?
[03:51:38.723 --> 03:51:45.105]  Because this will supposedly cut down the emissions and the congestion and blah, blah, blah, all this nonsense.
[03:51:45.125 --> 03:51:47.987]  That's just a scam, obviously, because that doesn't work.
[03:51:48.027 --> 03:51:53.369]  They tried the same thing in the UK, and it's just revenue for the government, for the state, right?
[03:51:54.809 --> 03:52:00.952]  But it's more than that, because if you remember, they were talking about the cities, the New Cities Initiative, where they're going to have
[03:52:01.564 --> 03:52:06.288]  Proposed cities that will ban meat, ban cars, and ban dairy.
[03:52:07.549 --> 03:52:09.490]  This is all the same plan.
[03:52:10.591 --> 03:52:15.115]  The same Club of Rome, austerity, deindustrialization, smart city plan.
[03:52:16.576 --> 03:52:27.565]  Kissinger ends his book with saying that whoever controls the tech will control the New World Order of the future, because the New World Order of the future is a techocracy.
[03:52:28.726 --> 03:52:28.946]  That's
[03:52:29.945 --> 03:52:32.446]  That's the last chapter in the book, is controlling the tech.
[03:52:35.307 --> 03:52:38.608]  And that's why they have to say, we're going to get rid of fossil fuels.
[03:52:39.649 --> 03:52:39.869]  Right?
[03:52:40.469 --> 03:52:46.491]  Prince Charles was up there at the COP 28 saying, I have much respect for the indigenous worldview.
[03:52:46.851 --> 03:52:49.852]  The indigenous worldview says we're all connected together.
[03:52:50.172 --> 03:52:51.433]  The indigenous worldview?
[03:52:51.873 --> 03:52:53.633]  Who doesn't care about the indigenous worldview?
[03:52:53.653 --> 03:52:55.414]  That guy wants to see all the indigenous
[03:52:55.996 --> 03:52:59.860]  People, the holy indigenous people that he pretends to worship, he wants to get rid of them.
[03:53:00.000 --> 03:53:00.660]  He wants them gone.
[03:53:01.882 --> 03:53:03.203]  So he doesn't care about the indigenous people.
[03:53:03.223 --> 03:53:11.851]  The indigenous people worldview means a worldview where we worship nature and you are seen as the virus in Mother Earth.
[03:53:11.911 --> 03:53:15.154]  That's the indigenous worldview that he's actually talking about.
[03:53:15.274 --> 03:53:19.118]  His indigenous druidic nature worship worldview is what he's talking about.
[03:53:20.973 --> 03:53:27.796]  But that's why it's so important to bring all of this in now and to make sure that they destroy, quote, fossil fuels.
[03:53:27.956 --> 03:53:30.737]  I mean, again, oil isn't dinosaur juice.
[03:53:30.997 --> 03:53:32.538]  In my view, that's a bunch of nonsense.
[03:53:33.158 --> 03:53:48.884]  But the getting rid of, quote, fossil fuels, it actually isn't even about destroying oil and oil production, because it's actually some of the biggest oil companies in the world that are behind the push to end, quote, fossil fuels.
[03:53:49.614 --> 03:53:54.675]  What this is really about is de-industrializing the West, destroying the petrodollar.
[03:53:55.155 --> 03:54:01.916]  By the way, I'm pro-Bitcoin, so I don't have a problem with the fiat dollar going away, because it's basically a giant scam anyway.
[03:54:01.996 --> 03:54:07.577]  But as it is right now, at least, the world is still dollar-centric.
[03:54:08.257 --> 03:54:18.279]  And that's gradually changing with the insane monetary policies of the Federal Reserve, and especially the Biden money printer going brr, brr, brr, right?
[03:54:19.136 --> 03:54:21.237]  So, what's the point of all this?
[03:54:21.477 --> 03:54:23.819]  Again, why would they want to de-industrialize the West?
[03:54:23.859 --> 03:54:24.999]  Why would they want to bring it down?
[03:54:25.760 --> 03:54:30.823]  Well, because to raise up the East and Eurasia, you have to de-industrialize the West.
[03:54:32.303 --> 03:54:35.685]  And then eventually the West and the East have to perhaps even collapse.
[03:54:35.745 --> 03:54:36.926]  Maybe there's a global war coming.
[03:54:37.927 --> 03:54:39.688]  Maybe it's a new scandemic.
[03:54:40.288 --> 03:54:43.890]  Maybe it's a giant cyber false flag.
[03:54:44.310 --> 03:54:44.750]  Who knows?
[03:54:46.138 --> 03:54:56.928]  The result is going to be some synthesis out of this, which will be the new austerity-based order of de-industrialization, zero growth.
[03:54:57.428 --> 03:54:59.770]  That's what they actually talk about at the COP28 meetings.
[03:55:00.351 --> 03:55:06.036]  Remember, did you hear Hillary saying that hundreds of thousands of people are going to die from heat?
[03:55:07.077 --> 03:55:07.377]  Right?
[03:55:07.938 --> 03:55:11.361]  And supposedly, what, like 60,000 people died in Europe, she said, from heat?
[03:55:12.299 --> 03:55:12.840]  It couldn't be.
[03:55:12.860 --> 03:55:14.801]  I mean, there's no other possible things.
[03:55:15.162 --> 03:55:17.444]  I mean, even if that number is even right, it's probably made up.
[03:55:17.524 --> 03:55:20.386]  But even if it was right, like, really?
[03:55:20.406 --> 03:55:28.773]  Maybe something that we were stabbing people with in the last three years, maybe that could have been a cause of... But no, it's the climate you see.
[03:55:30.635 --> 03:55:34.178]  I saw an article not too long ago, there's more whores now because of climate.
[03:55:34.980 --> 03:55:35.660]  I'm not joking.
[03:55:35.720 --> 03:55:39.442]  We're saying that women are having to become whores because of climate refugees.
[03:55:39.482 --> 03:55:42.483]  I mean, climate refugees is totally ridiculous, total nonsense.
[03:55:43.164 --> 03:55:45.885]  But I mean, if you believe that, then it's pretty much over, right?
[03:55:45.925 --> 03:55:47.766]  You're never going to, you're never going to come out of your trance.
[03:55:47.826 --> 03:55:49.227]  But most of us, I think we're awake.
[03:55:49.467 --> 03:55:50.047]  We're out of the trance.
[03:55:50.067 --> 03:55:54.669]  We understand that this is an intentional plan to take down and destroy the West.
[03:55:54.689 --> 03:55:59.391]  That's the only thing that makes sense, especially of the Biden administration's policies like that.
[03:55:59.851 --> 03:56:00.912]  That totally makes sense.
[03:56:01.491 --> 03:56:06.433]  If it's a siege tactic to destroy and take down the country, then everything actually makes perfect sense.
[03:56:06.753 --> 03:56:09.353]  It's actually cunning geniuses behind Biden.
[03:56:09.393 --> 03:56:11.154]  It's not just a bunch of incompetent idiots.
[03:56:11.474 --> 03:56:11.994]  It's a plan.
[03:56:12.574 --> 03:56:16.316]  And it's the same plan that's in all of these books that we read about.
[03:56:16.756 --> 03:56:26.899]  Austerity, deindustrialization, zero growth, ZPG, not just zero growth economically, but zero population growth, zero carbon emissions.
[03:56:33.601 --> 03:56:34.643]  Getting rid of fossil fuels.
[03:56:34.663 --> 03:56:38.808]  This would destroy basically the whole Western world.
[03:56:39.709 --> 03:56:45.537]  I think Alex was talking about this week that billions of people would die if you completely got rid of oil.
[03:56:46.698 --> 03:56:54.625]  I mean, even that Saudi guy, or United Emirates guy, whoever he was, at the COP28 meeting was like, well, we can't really do this yet.
[03:56:55.265 --> 03:56:56.846]  We can't actually get rid of oil.
[03:56:56.946 --> 03:57:03.572]  So, whoa, we're getting way ahead of ourselves here by saying that let's totally get rid of oil.
[03:57:03.592 --> 03:57:05.153]  I mean, this is just insane.
[03:57:05.994 --> 03:57:07.455]  The world presently runs on that.
[03:57:07.815 --> 03:57:09.797]  We're not in Star Trek yet.
[03:57:10.497 --> 03:57:11.818]  We need oil at this point.
[03:57:12.299 --> 03:57:13.560]  This is a giant scam.
[03:57:15.109 --> 03:57:26.636]  I think Zero Hedge had the headline that the top 28 grifters want two or three trillion dollars to solve Earth's heating crisis.
[03:57:26.736 --> 03:57:27.776]  Again, there is no crisis.
[03:57:27.836 --> 03:57:28.457]  It's all baloney.
[03:57:28.477 --> 03:57:29.317]  And they're all just con men.
[03:57:29.818 --> 03:57:33.740]  If you would like some interesting Christmas gifts, head on over to my website, Jays Analysis, in the shop.

[03:57:47.059 --> 03:57:53.563]  One of the most frustrating things about being awake to the globalist agenda is seeing the general public still asleep.
[03:57:53.643 --> 03:58:07.811]  By and large, not aware of the magnitude of the incredible danger they're under, but also the ongoing attacks and the magnitude of the death caused by the lethal injections, masqueradings, vaccines.
[03:58:08.726 --> 03:58:17.075]  It is so frustrating to see people going about their daily lives, oblivious, and you realize ignorance is not bliss, it equals death.
[03:58:18.632 --> 03:58:39.080]  But people are starting to really understand how serious things are, and that's a hard thing to do, because to wake up to a dystopic reality and realize that we're in the middle of a giant biological weapons war against humanity, and that there's mass sterilization that's already taking place, and they're cutting off all the major energy sources, is really hard to deal with, but it's the reality.
[03:58:39.641 --> 03:58:43.822]  Facing it is our only chance to turn this around, because stuff's about to get really, really nasty.
[03:58:44.222 --> 03:58:44.843]  Infowars.com.
[03:58:46.826 --> 03:58:52.130]  A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years that our amazing, high-quality coffee has not been available.
[03:58:52.590 --> 03:58:56.953]  And that's because the prices went up too high for the raw beans and the quality had gone down some.
[03:58:57.413 --> 03:58:59.875]  I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us.
[03:59:00.455 --> 03:59:09.842]  But now, we have brought back the coffee and it's even better from a national supplier that's veteran-owned and veteran-operated.
[03:59:10.022 --> 03:59:12.664]  It's powered by the company Minuteman Coffee.
[03:59:13.264 --> 03:59:21.287]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the best-tasting, best-smelling, strongest coffee that I have ever drank.

[03:59:23.628 --> 03:59:25.829]  All you gotta do is buy a bag of it and try it.
