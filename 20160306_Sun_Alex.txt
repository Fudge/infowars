[00:00.000 --> 00:11.000]  We are on the March. The Empire is on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:11.000 --> 00:20.000]  It is the Sunday, March 6, 2016 edition of this World Wide Broadcast. I'm Alex Jones
[00:20.000 --> 00:24.000]  here live. I'll be here for the next two hours. Ladies and gentlemen, then we'll be
[00:24.000 --> 00:32.000]  back tomorrow, 11 a.m. The 3 p.m. Central Standard Time. And of course, in Full Wars
[00:32.000 --> 00:40.000]  Nightly News, weeknight, 7 o'clock Central, also in FullWars.com, forward slash show.
[00:40.000 --> 00:47.000]  Wow, things are really getting wild. The establishment got behind Marco Rubio against
[00:47.000 --> 00:53.000]  Donald Trump. The money got behind him, but that's not really helping Rubio. He obviously
[00:53.000 --> 01:00.000]  lost in many of the caucus and primary states we saw over the weekend. Trump stays in front
[01:00.000 --> 01:11.000]  as Cruz raises pressure with split decision set back for establishment. Meanwhile, in a
[01:11.000 --> 01:17.000]  national poll, Trump and Clinton are tied in Michigan. They retain their leads in the
[01:17.000 --> 01:23.000]  delegate chase. Sanders saying, don't write us off. I'm reading Grudge Report headlines.
[01:23.000 --> 01:28.000]  56% say race. Very interesting. Should be 100%. It's over the top. Crazy. Romney. Now,
[01:28.000 --> 01:31.000]  here's the big one. We told you this was coming first on the show two weeks ago with
[01:31.000 --> 01:40.000]  Roger Stone. Romney won't rule out accepting nomination at contested convention. Meanwhile,
[01:40.000 --> 01:46.000]  Cruz says media sitting on bombshells about Trump. That's been my biggest concern. They're
[01:46.000 --> 01:52.000]  going to make a big deal about women. I mean, Hillary's got girlfriends openly she travels
[01:52.000 --> 01:59.000]  with. My issue is that they probably aren't even real bombshells. They'll just act like
[01:59.000 --> 02:04.000]  they're new bombshells. And then meanwhile, speaking of Roger Stone, who is the real Ted
[02:04.000 --> 02:08.000]  Cruz? He's got an article out. It's from Breitbart that we're linked to. Don't stay
[02:08.000 --> 02:16.000]  there. That's linked up on info wars.com. And of course, prison planet.com as well. It's
[02:16.000 --> 02:22.000]  right there on Drudge. But Rubio's problem is he does look like a little boy. Even though
[02:22.000 --> 02:27.000]  he's the same age as Cruz, he just doesn't look very manly and people want that in a
[02:27.000 --> 02:31.000]  leader. I don't blame him, but Drudge has a great photo of Rubio, I guess visited some
[02:31.000 --> 02:36.000]  fun house and sat in a chair that would be in regular size for 12 foot man. He looks like
[02:36.000 --> 02:43.000]  simply amazing. Now I do want to open the phones up today, even in the first hour, not
[02:43.000 --> 02:49.000]  just the second hour, we will be doing that to talk about the campaign, where you see
[02:49.000 --> 02:54.000]  it's going, what you really think the state of the economy is. Nancy Reagan, obviously
[02:54.000 --> 03:01.000]  dead at 94 of congestive heart failure. That woman was so hated by the left and so
[03:01.000 --> 03:09.000]  demonized. I never really attacked the lady, but I would when I would see her and see her
[03:09.000 --> 03:13.000]  as an elitist and not like her for some reason. And I was psychoanalyzing that the last few
[03:13.000 --> 03:17.000]  years and I thought about it this morning when I woke up and learned she was dead.
[03:17.000 --> 03:22.000]  Someone talked about why the left really hated her today and how growing up, just
[03:22.000 --> 03:27.000]  seeing her demonized on television and by comedians and by all these books and the
[03:27.000 --> 03:36.000]  rest of it that some of that BS rubbed off on me and not publicly. But I remember when
[03:36.000 --> 03:42.000]  Reagan died and I was at the RNC covering it in 2004 and she was up there talking about
[03:42.000 --> 03:46.000]  it. I remember seeing all their using his death. Oh, it's sick. It's political. Oh, and
[03:46.000 --> 03:51.000]  obviously some of it was, but she loved him. I mean, they were married and she did kiss
[03:51.000 --> 03:56.000]  the coffin, the flag draped coffin and you know, she did love Reagan and why were they
[03:56.000 --> 04:01.000]  attacking her? What did she really do? The answer is nothing. Then I started going,
[04:01.000 --> 04:05.000]  wait a minute. I remember talking to people about how Nancy Reagan thought George Herbert
[04:05.000 --> 04:11.000]  Walker Bush had had him shot and how much she hated them. So I Googled it today and
[04:11.000 --> 04:16.000]  found a bunch of mainstream articles about it. And so I shot a special report. I even
[04:16.000 --> 04:19.000]  came into work early to do it. It'll be on the show tomorrow. We're going to add all
[04:19.000 --> 04:23.000]  the graphics and all the articles. She did not want to go to dinner with them after he
[04:23.000 --> 04:27.000]  was shot. She did not want them around her and George Herbert Walker Bush wrote a book
[04:27.000 --> 04:33.000]  demonizing her claiming she was jealous of Barbara, who was about as lady like as you
[04:33.000 --> 04:38.000]  know, an old shoe compared to Nancy Reagan. What Nancy Reagan really said is those people
[04:38.000 --> 04:42.000]  think they're president. They're trying to push us out. They're dangerous. I don't want
[04:42.000 --> 04:46.000]  them anywhere near me because the inside baseball is we're going to get Wayne Madsen
[04:46.000 --> 04:54.000]  and others on about this. She knew Herbert Walker had met with the shooter's brother
[04:54.000 --> 04:58.000]  the day before.
[04:58.000 --> 05:03.000]  He's an outsider. He's not them. He's not part of the club. He's uncontrollable. You know,
[05:03.000 --> 05:07.000]  he hasn't been through the initiation rights. He didn't belong to the secret society.
[05:07.000 --> 05:11.000]  That was former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich explaining why the Republican
[05:11.000 --> 05:15.000]  establishment is so scared of Donald Trump. Gingrich would know about secret societies
[05:15.000 --> 05:20.000]  given his affiliation with Bohemian Grove, although he could also be speaking of the
[05:20.000 --> 05:25.000]  Skull and Bones Club, which is notorious for its initiation rituals. So far,
[05:25.000 --> 05:29.000]  Trump has played the role of outsider and people are loving him for it. But he has
[05:29.000 --> 05:34.000]  held private briefings with some secret society types like Richard Haas. Haas is the
[05:34.000 --> 05:38.000]  president of the Council on Foreign Relations. He's also a member of the influential
[05:38.000 --> 05:43.000]  Trilateral Commission and a builder for Gatendi. Earlier this week, a number of prominent
[05:43.000 --> 05:48.000]  neocons released an open letter stating their opposition to the candidacy of
[05:48.000 --> 05:52.000]  Donald Trump. Haas did not sign the letter. Could Richard Haas be one of Trump's
[05:52.000 --> 06:14.000]  potential cabinet picks? Read more now at infowars.com.
[06:22.000 --> 06:38.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[06:38.000 --> 06:42.000]  All right, excuse me. I wasn't ready as we came in live because I was busy texting Roger
[06:42.000 --> 06:48.000]  Stone, big developments, lots to divulge, new inside baseball pouring out that he just
[06:48.000 --> 06:53.000]  learned today. And so Niko give him a call to see what he wants to come on in the next
[06:53.000 --> 06:58.000]  hour and a half or so. That's the big consummate, Trump insider. Top linked on
[06:58.000 --> 07:06.000]  DrudgeReport.com is the story from the Daily Caller. And who is the real Ted Cruz? And
[07:06.000 --> 07:10.000]  it goes into the Goldman Sachs connections, all the rest up at the Council on Foreign
[07:10.000 --> 07:15.000]  Relations Connections. The reason I'm most concerned is he helped Haas show Obamacare,
[07:15.000 --> 07:21.000]  his wife helped Haas show North American Union TPP stuff at the CFR and he did this
[07:21.000 --> 07:27.000]  for George Herbert Walker Bush Sr. Now, maybe that's where he came from and he really
[07:27.000 --> 07:31.000]  is a patriot and he's had a lot of good votes the last four years in the U.S. Senate.
[07:31.000 --> 07:36.000]  So I like Ted Cruz. I'll give people a few passes. But I don't like it and I'm investigating
[07:36.000 --> 07:41.000]  him. Just like Donald Trump coming out last Thursday's Fox debate and saying he likes
[07:41.000 --> 07:45.000]  Richard and Haas. And I heard that and went, that's the head of the Council on Foreign Relations
[07:45.000 --> 07:52.000]  who he just met with the day before. Then Newt Gennrich came out who is a top globalist.
[07:52.000 --> 07:58.000]  See, I don't really watch people's rhetoric on TV. I read their books and I read the
[07:58.000 --> 08:02.000]  foreword to their books and I've read the Ph.D. papers he wrote. There's a reason
[08:02.000 --> 08:06.000]  Gennrich came from nowhere as a college professor to be Speaker of the House. The
[08:06.000 --> 08:13.000]  globalist, he's been to Bilderberg. They L-O-V-E him. He is in line to be a Henry Kissinger
[08:13.000 --> 08:19.000]  or Richard and Haas. In fact, I describe the globalist like shark teeth. And the day of
[08:19.000 --> 08:23.000]  the Rockefellers already falling out, he's like 99, Kissinger's kind of going over the
[08:23.000 --> 08:27.000]  Blue Mountains. He's fading out, doddering about a little bit. But those guys ran the
[08:27.000 --> 08:32.000]  Western world. I mean, they were the main honchos for the big shareholders, the Rothschilds
[08:32.000 --> 08:41.000]  and Rockefellers. But the shark teeth row behind that is coming in. And the row behind
[08:41.000 --> 08:49.000]  that is people like Newt Gennrich. Now, look, I don't blame Trump meeting with the top
[08:49.000 --> 08:53.000]  power brokers because it's good cop, bad cop. They're coming after them, everything they
[08:53.000 --> 08:56.000]  got, the systems against him, everybody from the Pope to the former British prime
[08:56.000 --> 09:01.000]  minister and the former Mexican president to the Chinese government. I mean, you name
[09:01.000 --> 09:06.000]  it, they're against him. And of course, this is the good cop maneuver. But it's being
[09:06.000 --> 09:10.000]  watched very carefully because I'm not like all in now for Trump. And so I'm going to
[09:10.000 --> 09:14.000]  sit here and be foolish and ignore what I see happening. I don't think it's critical
[09:14.000 --> 09:23.000]  yet because I'm sophisticated, but it is edging into very smelly territory. It's one
[09:23.000 --> 09:28.000]  thing of Trump's at dinner with these people, but he better not get in the bed with
[09:28.000 --> 09:33.000]  them. We're going to talk to Roger Stone, who's texting me right now about that coming
[09:33.000 --> 09:39.000]  up. Yeah, he wants to come on next hour, six o'clock Eastern, five o'clock Central.
[09:39.000 --> 09:46.000]  He wants to do fungs on the road. I just have to have stone all the time because he's just
[09:46.000 --> 09:49.000]  all over the news. He's all over the inside of what's happened with Trump. He is the
[09:49.000 --> 09:55.000]  Trump insider. And let's just say he's a conduit that can get info out that Trump doesn't
[09:55.000 --> 10:00.000]  want to put out at this time. And so you could say, like Lord of the Rings, you have the
[10:00.000 --> 10:08.000]  mouth of Sauron. I guess you could say to a certain extent, Stone is the mouth of Trump.
[10:08.000 --> 10:14.000]  So he'll be joining us, the uncensored mouth. We appreciate him coming on with us so often,
[10:14.000 --> 10:19.000]  pretty much every day. Now, before we go any further here, let me just, since I mentioned it,
[10:19.000 --> 10:23.000]  play this clip of Newt Gendrige Fargo to all these others because it's such a fascinating
[10:23.000 --> 10:30.000]  clip. Here's Newt Gendrige, who writes books about how he wants world government and microchips
[10:30.000 --> 10:35.000]  of the population and the forward for, was it Future Shock, Alvin and Heidi Toffler's
[10:35.000 --> 10:39.000]  1988 bestseller or whatever year it was. You can look it up. The forward's online. The
[10:39.000 --> 10:44.000]  public's going to have microchips, driverless cars, a world elite will run everything. Oh
[10:44.000 --> 10:52.000]  my God, it's such a utopia. He's a CFR darling. He helps steer the Republican Revolution down
[10:52.000 --> 10:59.000]  a rat hole in 1994. He took a revolution and quashed it. And now he's out endorsing Trump
[10:59.000 --> 11:04.000]  saying, Trump isn't part of the secret societies. Trump hasn't had the initiations. Let me tell
[11:04.000 --> 11:12.000]  you something. You don't get on the top committees unless you are a made man. And with the Italian
[11:12.000 --> 11:18.000]  mafia, you got to be Sicilian on both sides. And you've got to have killed at least three
[11:18.000 --> 11:26.000]  people in the service of the family that they can certify you killed with your bare hands.
[11:26.000 --> 11:32.000]  Now, what's a made man with a new world order? You've got to follow their orders for decades
[11:32.000 --> 11:38.000]  and be really smart. Do what they say at 3am if they call you. And it goes from the gambit
[11:38.000 --> 11:44.000]  of different subsections of killing people, child molestation, robbing, swindling, lying
[11:44.000 --> 11:52.000]  in court for people over and over again. Gay sex is just the opening entree. That's an
[11:52.000 --> 11:57.000]  hors d'oeuvre. Skull and bones, homosexual sex, bathing in human feces, being urinated
[11:57.000 --> 12:01.000]  on. I don't mean to be gross, but I mean, that's admitted in mainstream news about skull
[12:01.000 --> 12:08.000]  and bones. People say, are they into it? No. You send your son there when he's a junior
[12:08.000 --> 12:11.000]  and you think we're old enough and they've had him at parties already done some stuff
[12:11.000 --> 12:21.000]  and they say, all right, we're going to worship Satan now. How's that sound?
[12:21.000 --> 12:25.000]  And there are feeder groups like skull and bones all over the United States. Just as
[12:25.000 --> 12:29.000]  I told you in an order of death, dark secrets inside of Bohemian Grove and their films I
[12:29.000 --> 12:35.000]  made over a decade ago, there are subsections of the Bavarian Illuminati, which then has
[12:35.000 --> 12:39.000]  its skull and bones as its first chapter at Yale and New Haven, Connecticut. And then
[12:39.000 --> 12:44.000]  you've got Bohemian Grove taken over in 1900 by Taft, who's Bohemian Grove. They then take
[12:44.000 --> 12:49.000]  over other existing orders that are well-meaning and have good names, like Catholic orders
[12:49.000 --> 12:54.000]  like this order that Scalia was in, and then it becomes a front for the Illuminati, and
[12:54.000 --> 13:01.000]  then you can keep close eyes on good people so you can control them. And that's just
[13:01.000 --> 13:07.000]  what they do. And the Bavarian Illuminati, because of its management, its organization,
[13:07.000 --> 13:12.000]  is one of the most powerful power cults out there. And you notice I talked about that
[13:12.000 --> 13:17.000]  and how Bohemian Grove was running other groups. And one reason I know about this is my dad
[13:17.000 --> 13:22.000]  moved us out of Dallas when I was five years old in a middle class neighborhood and moved
[13:22.000 --> 13:26.000]  me to Rockwall, where we thought we were upper class. We weren't. There were billionaires
[13:26.000 --> 13:33.000]  swinging a stick around you. And true Luciferianism was just all over the place. And I later
[13:33.000 --> 13:37.000]  learned that they tried when I was like 13, 14, and 15, we had to move because of it.
[13:37.000 --> 13:40.000]  So that's why I have a firsthand experience of this. They were trying to recruit me now
[13:40.000 --> 13:46.000]  that I know what I saw into a real Illuminati feeder group. It was not crackhead, PCP, LSD
[13:46.000 --> 13:50.000]  head, Satanist in a trailer, you know, listen to heavy metal thinking they're doing a Satanic
[13:50.000 --> 13:55.000]  ritual. I mean, it was the real deal right out of a movie, folks. And I knew to stay out
[13:55.000 --> 13:59.000]  of it. My gut was getting away from this. It didn't matter if it was a hot, you know,
[13:59.000 --> 14:04.000]  16, 17, 18 year old girl when you're 13, 14, super hot chick and a brand new, you know,
[14:04.000 --> 14:11.000]  black Mercedes sedan or whatever Jaguar sedan, you name it, you know, take should be chosen
[14:11.000 --> 14:16.000]  the best time you ever had dating or three or four times. And then boom, we got some
[14:16.000 --> 14:20.000]  people want to meet you. People want to be involved with you. You're powerful. We want
[14:20.000 --> 14:24.000]  what you got. You're going places. And I'm saying I'm even that special, but you got
[14:24.000 --> 14:28.000]  to really say these people know what they're doing because boy, they were after me from
[14:28.000 --> 14:32.000]  a very young age and you look, they rule this world just like the Bible says secret societies
[14:32.000 --> 14:38.000]  and here he is not even joking. Here is somebody saying Donald never got initiated. The truth
[14:38.000 --> 14:42.000]  is he's never been in these grips. He's dead. He likes to eat a cheeseburger and hang out
[14:42.000 --> 14:48.000]  with hot chicks. Here is the inside baseball, the externalization of the method being thrown
[14:48.000 --> 14:54.000]  in your face by an initiated undoubtedly he's initiate of the high level. Here is, here's
[14:54.000 --> 14:59.000]  Newt Gendrich spilling the beans. Now they're faced with a very real prospect of Donald
[14:59.000 --> 15:04.000]  Trump becoming the leader of the party and it absolutely drives him crazy. They just
[15:04.000 --> 15:08.000]  cannot imagine sharing. Well, because he's an outsider. He's not them. He's not part
[15:08.000 --> 15:13.000]  of the club. He's uncontrollable. You know, he hasn't been through the initiation rights.
[15:13.000 --> 15:18.000]  He didn't belong to the secret society. And I think that they, they don't see him. They
[15:18.000 --> 15:25.000]  have no idea how to relate to him. So there you go. They have no idea how to relate to
[15:25.000 --> 15:30.000]  him. And then they go on to the longer pieces on info wars.com, the full five minute interview,
[15:30.000 --> 15:34.000]  six minute interview, talking about he's not part of the secret society, not part of the elite.
[15:34.000 --> 15:40.000]  Those aren't metaphors. Those aren't allegories. That's what it is. And I got to say the only
[15:40.000 --> 15:46.000]  group giving the Bavarian Luminati a run for its money in the power structure is the
[15:46.000 --> 15:50.000]  pedophiles. And they, they cross over into it, but they're really the dominant group.
[15:50.000 --> 15:55.000]  Because once you do that, there ain't no going back. And what a, you wonder why our leader
[15:55.000 --> 15:57.000]  is so evil because they're a bunch of child rapists.
[15:57.000 --> 16:02.000]  Clean, pure drinking water. You can't survive without it. But where do you get it? Alexa Pure

[17:15.000 --> 17:24.000]  We've been to the super male and the super female vitality, big changes, a lot of energy,
[17:24.000 --> 17:29.000]  we've gotten off to the cheap energy drinks, energy shots, they've got a ton of money there.
[17:29.000 --> 17:35.000]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet and then concentrated or
[17:35.000 --> 17:40.000]  maximum potency. They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover
[17:40.000 --> 17:44.000]  that up for a while but then burn you out in my experience, whereas stuff that gets your
[17:44.000 --> 17:49.000]  glands naturally going goes right to the source. So it's pretty exciting and I love it.

[17:59.000 --> 18:05.000]  Thousands of years ago there was a basic form of chivalry. Our ancestors would hear the drums
[18:05.000 --> 18:11.000]  of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[18:11.000 --> 18:17.000]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums
[18:17.000 --> 18:23.000]  of their own, air raid sirens. But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet
[18:23.000 --> 18:29.000]  war, pathogens added to the food and water, into the lining of plastics that destroy our
[18:29.000 --> 18:34.000]  vitality, turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[18:34.000 --> 18:41.000]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex. Anthroplex is designed with known, organic,

[19:07.000 --> 19:11.000]  myself. Talk about the effects. I feel great when I wake up in the morning. I have drive
[19:11.000 --> 19:16.000]  to go to the gym. I feel like I look better. I feel better. I feel sexier. I love it.

[20:25.000 --> 20:30.000]  This is Life Changing.
[20:55.000 --> 21:00.000]  This is Life Changing.
[21:26.000 --> 21:35.000]  My tribe is God, private property, family, right to self-defense, the natural order.
[21:35.000 --> 21:39.000]  I look at the globalists and everything they do. It's about overthrowing that natural order.
[21:39.000 --> 21:44.000]  So a bunch of control freaks can play God and create a monopoly. Here's the toll-free
[21:44.000 --> 21:48.000]  number to join us. I don't screen your calls, but sometimes I say I want to talk about certain
[21:48.000 --> 21:55.000]  subjects. And there's a wide discussion in the campaign, 2016, the primaries, what you
[21:55.000 --> 22:03.000]  just saw. The Pope calls migrant crisis Arab invasion. Do I suddenly have to like Pope?
[22:03.000 --> 22:08.000]  That's a snail. It suddenly just said something true.
[22:08.000 --> 22:16.000]  It says Europe must rediscover its cultural roots and says that many radical Muslims are
[22:16.000 --> 22:24.000]  not compatible in Europe. You mean Sunnis that came into Syria by the millions that
[22:24.000 --> 22:28.000]  were blowing up and killing and murdering everyone who kill other Muslims might not
[22:28.000 --> 22:33.000]  be compatible in Europe when they see women in miniskirts and rape them or attack them
[22:33.000 --> 22:40.000]  or poop in pools or burn things down? They're not compatible anywhere. Not in their own
[22:40.000 --> 22:50.000]  countries. You know, nobody will attack these figures. So I say really nasty things about
[22:50.000 --> 22:55.000]  the Pope because I know the guy's not stupid. And he comes to the United States and says
[22:55.000 --> 22:59.000]  you shouldn't have a wall. You should let everybody in. Anybody that builds walls is
[22:59.000 --> 23:07.000]  a devil. Not going to heaven. Excommunicated. And the Vatican has 200-foot walls and he's
[23:07.000 --> 23:15.000]  supported Italy not having, you know, millions of people just pour in. I was in Rome, man,
[23:15.000 --> 23:25.000]  just last year. There were homeless Africans and Arabs and Gypsies everywhere. And man,
[23:25.000 --> 23:29.000]  the Italians and others, the Russians or a lot of Russian tourists and German tourists,
[23:29.000 --> 23:32.000]  they would see Gypsies and they'd be scared to start. I mean, because I mean, let me tell
[23:32.000 --> 23:37.000]  you that they will rob you and then liberal media goes, it's a stereotype that Gypsies
[23:37.000 --> 23:44.000]  robbed. That's the admitted culture. In England, you can Google this. They are allowed to
[23:44.000 --> 23:50.000]  steal your travel trailer, your RV, because it's, quote, their culture. And the police
[23:50.000 --> 23:59.000]  let them keep them. Just type in Pikes. That's Irish Gypsies. But Romanov, Eastern Europeans
[23:59.000 --> 24:07.000]  are allowed to as well, are allowed to keep, what do they call them, travel wagons? I don't
[24:07.000 --> 24:12.000]  know what the Brits call it, but it's mainstream news. They are allowed because it's their culture.
[24:12.000 --> 24:19.000]  How about, well, it's my culture to chop your head off. Well, okay, go ahead. I'll never
[24:19.000 --> 24:23.000]  forget I was going to have to lake one time with friends fishing at a community dock in
[24:23.000 --> 24:30.000]  this home association. And I'm sitting there with my kids fishing at the dock. It's a boat
[24:30.000 --> 24:33.000]  dock. There's like six, seven boats there. It's a small dock and I'm fishing, catching
[24:33.000 --> 24:36.000]  catfish and stuff in the morning. So I stayed at a friend's house and barbecued that night.
[24:36.000 --> 24:39.000]  We got up, we're fishing, catching catfish and I don't know why I'm digressing. It's
[24:39.000 --> 24:55.000]  just political correctness. And there were the son and his UT professor wife were staying
[24:55.000 --> 25:03.000]  at their parents, her in-laws, lake house that was next door to the lake house I was
[25:03.000 --> 25:09.000]  staying at. And so they had a boat dock and a stall there. So they're right next to me.
[25:09.000 --> 25:12.000]  And I guess you knew who I was or something. And I'm sitting there like seven in the morning
[25:12.000 --> 25:16.000]  drinking coffee and my son is catching catfish and catching perch, catching a bunch of fish.
[25:16.000 --> 25:20.000]  He's all excited. My girls are running around catching fish. And I'm over here on the dock
[25:20.000 --> 25:26.000]  and she comes over and she goes, we're going to have some gypsies here today. And I looked
[25:26.000 --> 25:30.000]  at her and I was like, okay. And she goes, it's a right wing thing that they steal stuff
[25:30.000 --> 25:34.000]  and they do things. They really don't steal anything in their culture. They've been persecuted.
[25:34.000 --> 25:38.000]  You're not against gypsies, are you? And I never really thought about it, but that's
[25:38.000 --> 25:45.000]  interesting. There's going to be gypsies here. Okay. I guess we're making a film with them
[25:45.000 --> 25:50.000]  or something with UT. That's what she told me. And so I'm sitting there and she comes
[25:50.000 --> 25:54.000]  back over and starts again pecking me. And my son's got a birthmark on the right hand
[25:54.000 --> 26:00.000]  side of his head. Stork bites what they call them in Germany. It's not like I'm going to
[26:00.000 --> 26:03.000]  kill Gorbachev with a huesion, but it's a cute little, you know, you love everything about
[26:03.000 --> 26:06.000]  your kids. Little, little, little kiss. It's like a kiss on the side of his head. And she
[26:06.000 --> 26:11.000]  said, she doesn't address me. It's so perfect. She addresses my eight year old son at the
[26:11.000 --> 26:16.000]  time. This is like four years ago or whatever. And she goes, did you get hurt? Did someone
[26:16.000 --> 26:21.000]  hurt you? It's clearly a birthmark, little purple pink mark. He goes, that's my birthmark.
[26:21.000 --> 26:25.000]  And she was like a neurotic, crazy woman. She, she wasn't bad looking, but she was just
[26:25.000 --> 26:29.000]  totally out of her mind. She looks at me. She goes, sorry, just checking, just checking.
[26:29.000 --> 26:36.000]  And I was just like, whoa. And I was like, okay. And then the gypsies show up. And I'm
[26:36.000 --> 26:40.000]  like, oh my gosh, I've read about gypsies and their genetic traits and stuff that a lot
[26:40.000 --> 26:44.000]  of times the men have a lazy eye and the guy had the lazy eye, the whole nine yards and
[26:44.000 --> 26:50.000]  he's sitting there and they have this little gypsy kid when big waves are coming in. Now
[26:50.000 --> 26:54.000]  it's the afternoon and I'm back down there about to go on a boat with my family and their
[26:54.000 --> 27:02.000]  friends that had the boat. And there's a little kid without a life jacket up underneath the
[27:02.000 --> 27:06.000]  boat docks with huge waves crashing in. I'm sitting there Googling on my iPhone. Yeah,
[27:06.000 --> 27:11.000]  gypsy culture. Don't watch their kids. Yeah, lazy eye. Yeah. And then all of a sudden I've
[27:11.000 --> 27:16.000]  got like a storage shed. They have a storage shed area over there. And then the guy's like
[27:16.000 --> 27:21.000]  digging around in there. So we go on the boat, we come back and they're digging on the side
[27:21.000 --> 27:28.000]  of the beach, quote, looking for treasure. And then I started looking into the lore of
[27:28.000 --> 27:33.000]  that. They're always looking for treasure. It was the exact stereotype. So then that night
[27:33.000 --> 27:38.000]  they're over there at the house barbecuing. I go, I'm going to go over here and see this
[27:38.000 --> 27:46.000]  for myself. And I get over there. And there's all these liberals there. And they know who
[27:46.000 --> 27:53.000]  I am. And the gypsy guy comes over with the other gypsies. It's all men except the little
[27:53.000 --> 27:58.000]  girl they had with them. She's like a little gypsy kid out of a movie. Real cute girl, black
[27:58.000 --> 28:02.000]  hair, you know, the dark eyes that just look, you know, like a gypsy out of a movie, out
[28:02.000 --> 28:06.000]  of the hunchback of Notre Dame or something. I mean, it was like, wow, these were Roman
[28:06.000 --> 28:12.000]  off gypsies. And they're like, better not cause a problem. The big head professor from UT,
[28:12.000 --> 28:17.000]  the leader of the gypsies is coming. And he teaches they never did anything. It's all
[28:17.000 --> 28:23.000]  lies of the Nazis. And I went, you know, the Aztecs took over my culture and became really
[28:23.000 --> 28:27.000]  bloodthirsty and evil and killed most of the tribes around them. And the Nazis had an
[28:27.000 --> 28:32.000]  evil culture too. But that doesn't mean Germans did it. And I said, I've looked into gypsies
[28:32.000 --> 28:36.000]  and in general, that's their culture. They can rob outsiders. And I go, that's well known
[28:36.000 --> 28:40.000]  in all history. So just because the Nazis are bad doesn't mean then the gypsies are all
[28:40.000 --> 28:46.000]  good. Cultures go bad. And I think the general gypsy culture and anthropology and sociology
[28:46.000 --> 28:51.000]  is parasitic. And I said, so shut up. I'm not going to be intimidated by you. And I'm sick
[28:51.000 --> 29:16.000]  of your political correctness. And that was the end of it.
[29:22.000 --> 29:26.000]  If you are dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain

[33:09.000 --> 33:13.000]  Waging war on corruption.

[33:17.000 --> 33:22.000]  from the front lines of the info war.
[33:22.000 --> 33:28.000]  By the way I couldn't remember the exact headline I saw.
[33:28.000 --> 33:32.000]  It was out of the Daily Mail. It was also the BBC a few years ago.
[33:32.000 --> 33:36.000]  Of what Brits call RVs. They call them caravans.
[33:36.000 --> 33:40.000]  And it was pike. He's allowed to keep caravans.
[33:40.000 --> 33:44.000]  My buddy Pat Riley we couldn't find the article to put it on screen.
[33:44.000 --> 33:49.000]  He's watching right now at home in East Austin and he he was able to find it.
[33:49.000 --> 33:53.000]  So he's texting me telling me. I mean imagine it's your culture.
[33:53.000 --> 33:57.000]  You're allowed to steal people's RVs.
[33:57.000 --> 34:01.000]  It's okay. I can get it's your culture.
[34:01.000 --> 34:05.000]  You're the Hopi Indians. You've been taken peyote or masculine for thousands of years.
[34:05.000 --> 34:09.000]  Yes, as part of your religion you can take it even though it's illegal.
[34:09.000 --> 34:13.000]  First amendment.
[34:13.000 --> 34:17.000]  There it is police won't hand stolen caravan back to couple to protect human rights of the travelers.
[34:17.000 --> 34:21.000]  Living in it and then it goes into the pikes.
[34:21.000 --> 34:25.000]  And so I'm not even bashing the Romanoff's which they think are probably northern Indians from India.
[34:25.000 --> 34:29.000]  You know the classical nomadic gypsies.
[34:29.000 --> 34:33.000]  It's the Irish pikes are just as bad or worse.
[34:33.000 --> 34:37.000]  And then Brad Pitt makes movies about how cool they are.
[34:37.000 --> 34:41.000]  No that's not cool robbing people being white trash.
[34:41.000 --> 34:44.000]  They don't want you to judge any culture and say it's out of control.
[34:44.000 --> 34:48.000]  Speaking of Pat Riley, he's going to get video of it.
[34:48.000 --> 34:52.000]  His wife, he has like a workhouse studio.
[34:52.000 --> 34:56.000]  He's a kinesiologist and just personal training.
[34:56.000 --> 35:00.000]  They also have a gym and on the top floors where he lives and they got there's a well-known bar next door to him.
[35:00.000 --> 35:04.000]  And his wife was there the other day and people were outside drinking beer and all of a sudden there were all these black kids ages about
[35:04.000 --> 35:08.000]  11 to 13 black girls, black guys screaming down with
[35:08.000 --> 35:12.000]  why we're going to get you black power all this stuff.
[35:12.000 --> 35:16.000]  They were actually scared. Everybody went in. It was like a big confrontation.
[35:16.000 --> 35:20.000]  And then he was at the park in Central Austin on Lake Austin yesterday
[35:20.000 --> 35:24.000]  and black teenagers by 12, 13 with iron pipes
[35:24.000 --> 35:28.000]  broke into the baseball fields, broke in. We're doing all this stuff.
[35:28.000 --> 35:32.000]  And I said, why do you call the cops? And he just said, I just got out of there.
[35:32.000 --> 35:36.000]  And then he's trying to leave and they're like saying we're going to get you
[35:36.000 --> 35:40.000]  whitey, we're going to come after you.
[35:40.000 --> 35:44.000]  He's got a knife on me and stuff, but I don't want to stab teenagers. He said, I just left.
[35:44.000 --> 35:48.000]  And almost everyone I talked to
[35:48.000 --> 35:52.000]  downtown or in areas now says that's happening to him.
[35:52.000 --> 35:56.000]  They said there were like, you know, Mexicans or Mexican Americans with their strollers and stuff just ignoring the whole thing.
[35:56.000 --> 36:00.000]  But it was just like, hey, get out of here and it's like the Klan.
[36:00.000 --> 36:04.000]  The Klan would run around looking for black sand. Don't be around here. It's pure tribalism.
[36:04.000 --> 36:08.000]  And the reason I went off into all this is this is what they've
[36:08.000 --> 36:12.000]  done. I forgot the most important part. Beyoncé did that Super Bowl thing about Black Lives Matter
[36:12.000 --> 36:16.000]  and whitey and all this. They were singing in both
[36:16.000 --> 36:20.000]  cases. The Beyoncé song because his wife knew it.
[36:20.000 --> 36:24.000]  She liked it on the radio. They were singing it a different group
[36:24.000 --> 36:28.000]  like three days ago as she's on the top of her house. They have a big balcony
[36:28.000 --> 36:32.000]  watching it happen. And then they're separately miles away
[36:32.000 --> 36:36.000]  at the park walking the dog and going for a hike. And it's happening.
[36:36.000 --> 36:40.000]  And I mean, they're like, wow, do we even go out?
[36:40.000 --> 36:44.000]  And again, I'm not a guy that can send the racial stuff. I grew up in Dallas, Texas, like half black,
[36:44.000 --> 36:48.000]  tons of black friends. It wasn't like that. There were some racist black folks that would attack you.
[36:48.000 --> 36:52.000]  And the same thing, white guys, red necks would see and go, you know, this bonfire Yankee
[36:52.000 --> 36:56.000]  and attack you. And I was from Texas. It's just tribal. I got that even when I was like
[36:56.000 --> 37:00.000]  13 years old. But they're got great restaurants
[37:00.000 --> 37:04.000]  in Jennifer Fidey's Austin. It's a great area. I won't go there anymore.
[37:04.000 --> 37:08.000]  And I was told they put pressure to get me off local radio for just talking about it
[37:08.000 --> 37:12.000]  because the police know it's totally true. They didn't pressure it was others
[37:12.000 --> 37:16.000]  that I mean, every time I've gone out to eat in East Austin at night,
[37:16.000 --> 37:20.000]  I've been harassed and demanded money because I'm basically white.
[37:20.000 --> 37:24.000]  And then if this has happened to me and everybody I know, how bad must it be
[37:24.000 --> 37:28.000]  where I can't go to a boat dock without some weird white UT professor
[37:28.000 --> 37:32.000]  going, you're white. Did you abuse your son?
[37:32.000 --> 37:36.000]  He has a red mark on his head. Gypsies are coming. They're good people.
[37:36.000 --> 37:40.000]  I mean, they're just like weird, crazy people that want to
[37:40.000 --> 37:44.000]  dominate you with their social justice. They don't write books. They don't build
[37:44.000 --> 37:48.000]  cars. They don't plant crops. They don't paint pictures. They just obsess
[37:48.000 --> 37:52.000]  in boss all day and find phantoms
[37:52.000 --> 37:56.000]  of people that want to mess with them. All I want is human empowerment.
[37:56.000 --> 38:00.000]  I said I'd give the number out and take your calls. I told free number to join us
[38:00.000 --> 38:04.000]  about the election, about Trump, about everything that's happening. It's 877-789
[38:04.000 --> 38:08.000]  Alex. 877-789-2539.
[38:08.000 --> 38:12.000]  That's 877-789-2539. We have a different number on
[38:12.000 --> 38:16.000]  Sundays in the weekday show. It's all produced in-house. That's 877-789
[38:16.000 --> 38:20.000]  Alex.
[38:20.000 --> 38:24.000]  Now coming up in the next hour for about two segments is Trump insider, former
[38:24.000 --> 38:28.000]  head of his campaign, Roger Stone, who is the real Trump for the Daily Caller. It's up on
[38:28.000 --> 38:32.000]  First.com. His connections to New World Order and more. I'm not demonizing. I'm not
[38:32.000 --> 38:36.000]  attacking him. We're just going to investigate this with him coming up.
[38:36.000 --> 38:40.000]  What got me on the whole Gypsy Jag was
[38:40.000 --> 38:44.000]  I was in Rome. We even got some video of this. I think I'm going to put out this week.
[38:44.000 --> 38:48.000]  There's so much footage. He just reminded me of today and I had a meeting with Rob Do. He said,
[38:48.000 --> 38:52.000]  oh, I have that footage. We'll get it out. We'd be all over waiting to go
[38:52.000 --> 38:56.000]  into the old Rome, the old Roman forum.
[38:56.000 --> 39:00.000]  We'd be waiting to go in the Coliseum. We'd be waiting to go in anywhere.
[39:00.000 --> 39:04.000]  And Gypsies would just glide up
[39:04.000 --> 39:08.000]  with trained menace and say, give me money.
[39:08.000 --> 39:12.000]  And then menace, give me money
[39:12.000 --> 39:16.000]  without saying, or I'm going to hurt you. That's a nice
[39:16.000 --> 39:20.000]  watch. I really need some money. Bad or bad things are going to happen.
[39:20.000 --> 39:24.000]  And I would just see the Italians in fear.
[39:24.000 --> 39:28.000]  Gypsies. And then you're on the news like Gypsies
[39:28.000 --> 39:32.000]  are the nicest people in the world. They're so loving and so good. We should all love them.
[39:32.000 --> 39:36.000]  This is political correctness. The Pope says
[39:36.000 --> 39:40.000]  that we have to accept unlimited criminals
[39:40.000 --> 39:44.000]  undocumented, whoever. And granted, most of the folks coming in from
[39:44.000 --> 39:48.000]  Latin America are nice people and want to work hard. They just have to be vetted and checked, folks.
[39:48.000 --> 39:52.000]  We aborted all of our children, whether we were Hispanic, white or black. So just
[39:52.000 --> 39:56.000]  gotta bring folks in. I'm all for immigrants. We're a nation of immigrants.
[39:56.000 --> 40:00.000]  But put it to you
[40:00.000 --> 40:04.000]  this way. If there was a Latin American country free in America, I'd move there. I ain't running from
[40:04.000 --> 40:08.000]  brown people. I love them. The point is, is that I'm not going to
[40:08.000 --> 40:12.000]  watch this hypocrite sit here and
[40:12.000 --> 40:16.000]  lecture me when he lives behind 200 foot walls, and then he comes out in a
[40:16.000 --> 40:20.000]  Breitbart article. We came out in Reuters. Pope calls the migrant crisis
[40:20.000 --> 40:24.000]  an Arab invasion, close quote. Le Pen, the presidential frontrunner
[40:24.000 --> 40:28.000]  in France, was arrested for that very statement. Says Europe.
[40:28.000 --> 40:32.000]  Think of that story. Arrested for a speech. Says Europe
[40:32.000 --> 40:36.000]  must reconsider its cultural roots. And he wanted to say, country should reach out.
[40:36.000 --> 40:40.000]  We should all love each other. We should work with each other, but it's okay for Europe to keep its identity
[40:40.000 --> 40:44.000]  and to be Christian, and that a lot of these Muslims being brought
[40:44.000 --> 40:48.000]  in are incompatible. Because it's true. I mean, you're bringing in 5
[40:48.000 --> 40:52.000]  million radical jihadists who were busy invading other
[40:52.000 --> 40:56.000]  countries to teach other Muslims how to live their lives. I'm all for bringing
[40:56.000 --> 41:00.000]  in Jordanians and Lebanese and the Iraqis
[41:00.000 --> 41:04.000]  I know are really cultured and smart and want freedom. They all wanted freedom. Our
[41:04.000 --> 41:08.000]  government brought in radical jihadis, blew up all their power plants, and put
[41:08.000 --> 41:12.000]  people in charge that literally won't let women take bags off their
[41:12.000 --> 41:16.000]  heads. And the left loves it.
[41:16.000 --> 41:20.000]  They hate the West so much
[41:20.000 --> 41:24.000]  that cultural suicide bombers like radical Muslims are beautiful to them, and then
[41:24.000 --> 41:28.000]  they can say, you got to conform to them, not data, our
[41:28.000 --> 41:32.000]  freedoms. If your wife wants to wear a bag over her head
[41:32.000 --> 41:36.000]  and have her sexual pleasure centers cut off, do it,
[41:36.000 --> 41:40.000]  but at 18, you're not shopping
[41:40.000 --> 41:44.000]  a woman's private parts off when she's a baby.
[41:44.000 --> 41:48.000]  And I used to go, oh, you can argue with circumcision
[41:48.000 --> 41:52.000]  because you can't, you can claim there's some medical reasons for it
[41:52.000 --> 41:56.000]  because I'm circumcised. That's just what I expect. I live in it. But then I was thinking,
[41:56.000 --> 42:00.000]  wait a minute, why don't I just accept this is how this is all done, and someone
[42:00.000 --> 42:04.000]  else made the decision. I'm not bashing my parents. I'm not going to feel like a victim, make some huge deal
[42:04.000 --> 42:09.000]  out of it. But there is an argument not to
[42:09.000 --> 42:13.000]  circumcise somebody. If they're 16 or 18, they want to get it done, that's their issue.
[42:13.000 --> 42:17.000]  But why am I living under some
[42:17.000 --> 42:21.000]  religious dogma of 3,000 years old, and that's just accepted and I didn't
[42:21.000 --> 42:25.000]  get to make that choice. But let me tell you, circumcision
[42:25.000 --> 42:29.000]  from what I've read is nothing compared to what they did to women's private parts.
[42:29.000 --> 42:33.000]  It's unbelievable. They mutilate the hell out of them.
[42:33.000 --> 42:37.000]  And you know what, I say Muslims can't do that to their daughters in America.
[42:37.000 --> 42:41.000]  And if you don't like it, get the hell out of my country. Go live in some hell hole
[42:41.000 --> 42:45.000]  and run around murdering each other all you want. Don't come here and do it, because I'm a real liberal.
[42:45.000 --> 42:49.000]  See, I'm for more freedom, lower taxes, and running my life.
[42:49.000 --> 42:53.000]  We're going to come back with your phone calls and a ton of clips. I haven't gone to these clips yet. Stay with us.
[42:57.000 --> 43:01.000]  Tell folks how you got introduced to SuperMail, and then when Superfemale came out,
[43:01.000 --> 43:05.000]  tell us what happened. After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband,
[43:05.000 --> 43:09.000]  I had to try it for myself. Talk about the effects. I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[43:09.000 --> 43:13.000]  I have drive to go to the gym. I feel like I look better. I feel better.
[43:13.000 --> 43:17.000]  I feel sexier. I love it. Even if you don't believe in supplements,
[43:17.000 --> 43:21.000]  take the challenge. Get a bottle of SuperMail, a bottle of Superfemale.

[47:01.000 --> 47:10.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[47:10.000 --> 47:20.000]  Hello, this is Hank Hill, and I'm telling you what, you need to listen to Alex Jones.
[47:20.000 --> 47:25.000]  At infowars.com.
[47:25.000 --> 47:36.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[47:36.000 --> 47:40.000]  We are back live, going to your phone calls.
[47:40.000 --> 47:44.000]  I didn't mean to get off into a jag about the pub for circumcision and the rest of it.
[47:44.000 --> 47:48.000]  I'm just saying, we're going to criticize the muslims sexually mutilating their daughters.
[47:48.000 --> 47:52.000]  I mean, hardcore. There's no medical reason. They say it's evil to have pleasure.
[47:52.000 --> 47:56.000]  Why'd God give us that then?
[47:56.000 --> 48:00.000]  Why are we doing circumcisions? And there are some medical arguments for it, a lot of infections.
[48:00.000 --> 48:05.000]  And I think circumcision is more arguable than the other thing, but still I think it's a free will issue.
[48:05.000 --> 48:08.000]  I'm going to ask, well, you know, kids can't make decisions.
[48:08.000 --> 48:11.000]  That's a whole other show. I don't want to go down that rabbit hole.
[48:11.000 --> 48:16.000]  We got loaded phone lines, Chase, Dan, Frank, Phil, Terry, Joshua, many others.
[48:16.000 --> 48:22.000]  We're going to be going to your phone calls here in just a second, but there's a few clips I want to get to before we do that.
[48:22.000 --> 48:27.000]  We played Newt Gennrich admitting that, well, Trump's not part of a secret society, part of the n-club.
[48:27.000 --> 48:33.000]  This other clip is Beck. Beck is on ABC News comparing Trump to Hitler.
[48:33.000 --> 48:38.000]  I don't want to bash Beck. He's done some good work before, but man, he's really doing unfair stuff.
[48:38.000 --> 48:45.000]  And then Friday, he talked about, if I was on a stage with Trump, I'm going to play the whole 10-minute clip and put part of it.
[48:45.000 --> 48:49.000]  You can find the whole thing online. I would stab him.
[48:49.000 --> 48:51.000]  So the Secret Service went there. It's certainly an incitement.
[48:51.000 --> 48:55.000]  He went, oh, Stu says I was saying I was going to stab my co-host.
[48:55.000 --> 48:59.000]  No, he says, if I was on the stage, I couldn't help myself by stabbing.
[48:59.000 --> 49:08.000]  So he did it as a publicity stunt, a desperate publicity stunt, because his media system is collapsing, according to the news.
[49:08.000 --> 49:12.000]  And according to, I mean, I was told this a year and a half ago, they were trying to sell me his channel.
[49:12.000 --> 49:18.000]  You know, the people that he has his channel on, it's like he pays $25 million a year for a feed on cable.
[49:18.000 --> 49:22.000]  Like no one watches that. They watch content and information. It's the internet.
[49:22.000 --> 49:27.000]  Sure, we're on satellites on some TV systems, but that's if they want us, we're on a satellite, not a channel.
[49:27.000 --> 49:33.000]  You want us, we're on TV satellites and stations are picking them up all over, but we're free to air, but we're not paying for a channel.
[49:33.000 --> 49:40.000]  And so I was like, and then another TV network offered us Glenn Beck's channel way before Trump ever came out and said he was in financial trouble.
[49:40.000 --> 49:48.000]  I don't want him to go away, but he thinks he's a cult leader and that he's God.
[49:48.000 --> 49:56.000]  And, you know, it's just sad to see him do this because if I said, you know, I want to stab somebody, I'd get in trouble.
[49:56.000 --> 50:03.000]  Or I guess I'd have one of my people, if I said, if I was on the stage, this is quoting Trump, if I was on the stage, I couldn't help myself with stabbing.
[50:03.000 --> 50:11.000]  Secret service shows up and I go, oh, I meant Nico. Right, Nico? I said I would stab you. So here's the clip.
[50:11.000 --> 50:18.000]  If I were on the stage, I would have said, have you been listening to him tonight? Have you been listening to what I say about him?
[50:18.000 --> 50:27.000]  Also, why would you just sit in their shoes? I mean, was he a gigantic shoes?
[50:27.000 --> 50:33.000]  Oh man, if I were close enough and I had a knife, really, I mean, the stabbing just wouldn't stop.
[50:33.000 --> 50:41.000]  So they're talking about his shoes, meaning the feet, the hands, the size of the package. They're talking about Trump.
[50:41.000 --> 50:49.000]  It's a publicity stunt on purpose and he knows he's going to lie to the secret service. That's called weasel behavior.
[50:49.000 --> 50:58.000]  A premeditated weasel behavior. I'm so sick of these premeditators. I was tired of them.
[50:58.000 --> 51:04.000]  And I just wish that Glenn Beck wasn't always trying to get me kicked off radio stations.
[51:04.000 --> 51:10.000]  Wasn't always behind the scenes going after sponsors. We have our own products, so we just cut you out of the whole mix, bro.
[51:10.000 --> 51:18.000]  I mean, he literally, you know about his whole family and the mom committing suicide and the dad and all the weird stuff?
[51:18.000 --> 51:26.000]  Like an Annabelle Horror episode. And then he'd call up other talk shows he didn't like when he heard that the wife had a miscarriage
[51:26.000 --> 51:34.000]  and congratulate him on a miscarriage and Glenn Beck's an evil man. And that's why he's always claiming he's such a good person.
[51:34.000 --> 51:51.000]  It's because he's a big, fat, effeminate bully. And so I won't take any pleasure in his collapse, but everybody that knows Glenn Beck hates him.
[51:51.000 --> 52:01.000]  I can't tell you the Fox News people, the other talk show host, the people that know him, they say, my God, you've never seen a more conceited, arrogant, fake, hateful pansy.
[52:01.000 --> 52:18.000]  He does acting classes all day with all these pansies and literally hops around like, I mean, he is a Liberace, folks, a piece of weirdness in a man's world.
[52:18.000 --> 52:28.000]  And no wonder he doesn't like other men and people that are successful because he's like a witch, weird, freaky women, hate other women that are successful
[52:28.000 --> 52:36.000]  and want to push him down. That's a very bad feminine trait I found. He's a woman. And I don't mean that to women that are real women.
[52:36.000 --> 52:52.000]  I mean, he's a bad woman. Glenn Beck is a haughty tart. He's a haughty, arrogant, narcissistic, cowardly piece of crap.
[52:52.000 --> 52:59.000]  All right, I'm done. I'm sorry. I said I wouldn't do it. I just can't help it. I just have to tell the truth. I'm sorry. I apologize.
[52:59.000 --> 53:09.000]  I want to go to Chase. I want to go to Phil. I want to go to a bunch of people. I'm going to go to you in just a moment.
[53:09.000 --> 53:15.000]  But since I mentioned in the other clip, let's go ahead and play Kasek. And by the way, he's in the Washington Times.
[53:15.000 --> 53:24.000]  He gave a speech. Mitt Romney said we should have a broker convention. Even if Trump gets 900 delegates or 1000, but doesn't get the 1100 or something.
[53:24.000 --> 53:33.000]  And now Kasek has come out at CPAC and said, let's take it away from him. Man, they never do that in elections. That is so criminal.
[53:33.000 --> 53:39.000]  They changed the rules of the 70s, both the Democrats and Republicans to do it.
[53:39.000 --> 53:51.000]  They talk about nakedly stealing stuff. They're doing it. They're openly selling it to all the wannabe Republicans in their little sports jackets who are about as conservative as $3 bills.
[53:51.000 --> 53:57.000]  You know, the left came in and took over conservatism after Goldwater scared them. And you talk to these average Republicans.
[53:57.000 --> 54:05.000]  They laugh at you and their total abortion lovin, devil lovin, open border lovin, corporate pimps that want a big slave population.
[54:05.000 --> 54:12.000]  And they'll laugh at you because they're cynical and hate everybody, including their family. And they think I'm weak because I care about people.
[54:12.000 --> 54:18.000]  Yeah, I'll show them weak. They ever throw the first punch when I get my hands around their throat.
[54:18.000 --> 54:30.000]  When I turn that governor off, you people are cowards. You don't have any empathy because you're not alive. If you were alive, you'd have empathy. You'd have a lot of it.
[54:30.000 --> 54:36.000]  But we'll get you. You think you're going to get us?
[54:36.000 --> 54:40.000]  Let's go to this clip. Here's Kasek.
[54:40.000 --> 54:48.000]  But the fact is, Sean, you have to do it right. And you can have a bunch of people in smoke-filled rooms. Who are the establishment, by the way?
[54:48.000 --> 54:51.000]  And you and I never been the establishment.
[54:51.000 --> 55:01.000]  Okay. And my only fear of a convention is that these...
[55:01.000 --> 55:11.000]  This is so rich. This is the new thing. Newt Gendrich's anti-establishment now. You got Kasek total insider establishment. And you and I, Sean, we're not establishment, so Sean won't call him on it.
[55:11.000 --> 55:21.000]  We don't smoke-filled rooms. We're going to steal the convention from the popular vote for the nomination in front of everybody.
[55:21.000 --> 55:30.000]  Because if you rape a woman at high noon in the town square, it's not rape. So let's go back to this textbook spin. Here it is.
[55:30.000 --> 55:35.000]  Who are the establishment, by the way? And you and I never been the establishment.
[55:35.000 --> 55:45.000]  Never. Okay. And my only fear of a convention is that these kind of connected interests would dominate. And we're going to have to prevent that.
[55:45.000 --> 55:49.000]  I'm a little concerned that this is... You think your only path to the nomination is through abroad.
[55:49.000 --> 55:57.000]  Look, I have to win. It's not impossible. I have to win after I win Ohio. I have to win 68% of the remaining delegates.
[55:57.000 --> 56:07.000]  Marco's got to win, like, 64. And, you know, Ted is somewhere around 59 or 60. It's unlikely. And so if nobody goes to the convention with enough delegates,
[56:07.000 --> 56:15.000]  then we're going to have to meet in... By the way, they told me the convention's going to be held in Cleveland. That's kind of interesting. Place close to home.
[56:15.000 --> 56:21.000]  And the word is there. Stuff in the ballot boxes in the early voting in Ohio right now, even though he's behind many of the polls against Trump.
[56:21.000 --> 56:29.000]  So you get how this works. You get how this conference game works. We're not smoke-filled rooms. We're anti-establishment.
[56:29.000 --> 56:37.000]  That's why nobody's going to get enough votes. Yeah, he'll have 1,000, 1,100 or whatever, 900 on the low end, and then Casey will have 100.
[56:37.000 --> 56:44.000]  But he didn't get the majority, so we get to steal it. We're not establishment. We're not stealing it. We just are.
[56:44.000 --> 56:49.000]  And by the way, if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. And you didn't build your business.
[56:49.000 --> 56:57.000]  Briefly, we are Lister Supported, and you're the folks that spread the word about this transmission, whether it's on AMFM stations, TV, radio, internet, you name it.

[59:51.000 --> 01:00:07.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:11.000]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:22.000]  Racial voting really bothers me. If there was a black constitutional libertarian that had a history of being a patriot, I'd vote for him and love vote for a black person. Try to bring unity. It'd be the cherry on top.
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:38.000]  Marco Rubio just won Puerto Rico, the Republican primary. And it's all because of a Spanish surname. I mean, it is racial politics. White people do it. Everybody does it. But it's just, let's be honest, it's not just white people that do racial stuff.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:47.000]  I just want the Renaissance to take over. I just want life extension. I want to go to space. I want humanity to win.
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:55.000]  But elites can control people playing us off against each other and stealing all the resources. And if we go down this path, we may not survive as a species.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:09.000]  If you go to your phone calls, Terry and Cindy, and of course, Chase and others, they're up first. We've got Dan, let's talk about Ron Paul coming out against Trump.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:19.000]  Ron Paul is a purist libertarian, not even so much a populist. And I respect his view. I can see a lot of problems with Trump. And it's good to be a purist. You know, at a certain point you can do that.
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:27.000]  I'm just saying this establishment hates him. He's the best vote right now. And if he turns against freedom, we'll go after him. You notice how he came out against torture once you do the facts.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:39.000]  I mean, I actually like that. It's not a flip-flop. He changes view. There's a reason they're panicking against Trump. We'll talk about it later.
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:43.000]  Terry in Minnesota, you're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.000]  Hello, Alex.
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.000]  Hi.
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:55.000]  Hey, a quick bio. I'm about a one-month listener. I talked to you last week for the first time. I've been trying to do a lot of catch-up on the YouTube to see where everything's all with you guys.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:05.000]  I noticed you did a January 17th show on, I think, State or something like that. But I'm a Bible guy, too. As far as Trump goes, I'm more of a spiritual guy than a Bible guy.
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:10.000]  And I'm more spiritually entwined. Your show is real secular and scriptural.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:16.000]  No, it's okay. No, no. I mean, I'm anti-religion, pro-spiritual, pro-God.
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:21.000]  Well, here's my thing. I don't know if you've ever heard of the Bat Creek Stone.
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000]  No, I haven't.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:31.000]  Okay, the guy that deciphered that, Glenn Beck was talking about that on the show when they got rid of him three years ago.
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:43.000]  And they found this thing. Anyway, it was on the turn of the century, 1900. The guy that deciphered that, the scholar that deciphered that stone, basically, is my Bible teacher.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:48.000]  And he's pretty good. He's head of the largest...
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:03:02.000]  Well, I know they found a bunch of ancient stones. They've dug up Vikings all over Canada, the U.S. There was trade. There was Chinese jade that the Aztecs had. There was trade in Tulum and other areas.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:07.000]  So we know there's a lot of history we don't know about. And the elite reportedly do have those annals.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:12.000]  And they keep that from us because those that don't know history are doomed to repeat it. Good to hear from you.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:17.000]  Let's go to Chase now. Chase in Texas. Chase, you're on the air.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.000]  Yes, sir.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.000]  Welcome. Go ahead.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.000]  Can you hear me?
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000]  Yes, I sure can.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.000]  Can you hear me?
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.000]  I sure can.
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:32.000]  All right. Okay, I get. Anyhow, I know I've called in a bunch, but I just wanted to say, you know, I want to pay my respects to Nancy Reagan Pat, since she was a true First Lady of this nation.
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:42.000]  And secondly, as far as the Glenn Beck guy, you know, I really got a bad taste in my mouth about him when he sang the Deborah Medina campaign with bars 9-11's truth.
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:51.000]  But sure, I mean, isn't Glenn Beck discredited that it comes out there's 28 pages that Saudi Arabia ran the attacks? Our government bare minimum stood down.
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:58.000]  That's members of Congress have read it. It's proof our own military with a whistle in closed hearings. They were ordered to stand down.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:05.000]  We already knew that, but it's a fact and he can call us traders all day. He is the sack of garbage saying we're traders.
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:15.000]  Well, I just I think he's phony is a $3 bill. And I've said that for years. And that's what really kind of perturbed me about him.
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:20.000]  And, you know, back during the Medina campaign, but, you know, I'm a forgiving man. I'm a Christian.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:27.000]  But in my opinion, if Mr. Trump's listening or Mr. Stone's listening, I think it's time to take the governor off.
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:32.000]  Let's go double barrel blast the truth. We need to hit him with with everything.
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:37.000]  I hear your brother and you're welcome to call him. We got open phones. A few days wait. We do first time caller here.
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:46.000]  Welcome. God bless you. All right, we've got to other colors. We got Dan and Frank and Phil and Joshua and so many others.
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:52.000]  Cindy and Rusty and others holding. I'm Alex Jones, your host Roger Stone is listening. He was on hold when you just said that.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:58.000]  We're going to come back and talk to him straight away from the stonezone.com.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:03.000]  Tell folks how you got introduced to Super Male and then when Super Female came out. Tell us what happened.
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:07.000]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000]  Talk about the effects.
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:16.000]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning. I have drive to go to the gym. I feel like I look better. I feel better. I feel sexier. I love it.
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:22.000]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge. Get a bottle of Super Male, a bottle of Super Female.

[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:35.000]  We are back live now into the second hour. Roger Stones with us this segment and the next, but I'm going to be going to your calls here in just a few minutes.
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:46.000]  This is going to be fast moving. We're going to go to Phil and others here in just a moment. Rusty Cindy and many others.
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:55.000]  The toll free number to join us because after he leaves, we'll be taking calls 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539.
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:02.000]  Roger Stone has the top story there on the left hand side of dredgerport.com.
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:08.000]  And the question he asked is who is the real Ted Cruz?
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:18.000]  There's another story up on infowars.com, Prismplanet.com and on Drudge. Mitt Romney won't rule out accepting GOP nomination at contested convention.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:27.000]  And we just played John Kasich, the Ohio governor, where we have major evidence of election fraud and early voting and absentee ballots right now.
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:33.000]  We reported on that last week saying he will win and that they will broker the convention in his home state.
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:41.000]  And he plans to take it from Trump, even if Trump has a thousand delegates. In case it gets five, he will be our president.
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:48.000]  So incredible, mainlining psychological inoculation to condition us to accept this.
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:54.000]  So getting into election fraud, getting into the attacks, getting into who Ted Cruz really is.
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:08:00.000]  Is Roger Stone joining us via the phone to consummate Trump insider, former head of his campaign and Trump confidant.
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:05.000]  Roger, thanks for coming on three or four days a week. Things are so fast-moving and I couldn't think of a better expert to get on.
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000]  Where do you want to start first?
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:15.000]  Well, I've never really seen anything like this in almost 40 years in American politics working in nine presidential campaigns.
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:25.000]  Alan, first of all, the place to start, I guess, is the incredible onslaught of anti-Trump television ads now completely saturating the airwaves in Florida, in Ohio.
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:34.000]  And nationally, I'm able to report to you, last week reported, 75 million gathered by the Koch brothers, not their own money. Very clever.
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:42.000]  And your phone cut off for a moment on the Koch brothers. Start back over, what had been gathered. You first broke that, Roger ran it, went viral, you've been proven right.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:51.000]  Yes, but it is now, there's developments here. Their pot is up from 75 million to 145 million.
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:55.000]  So there are now additional 70 million.
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:58.000]  Whoa, 145 million to crush Trump.
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:11.000]  In a national television advertisement, I must tell you, Alan, here in Florida, you cannot turn on the television, the cable, the radio, without getting efficient anti-Trump commercial.
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:25.000]  You've never seen anything like it. You have Rubio and Cruz working together in Puerto Rico, squeezing Trump out, Cruz purposely draining votes from Trump so that Rubio took all 23 delegates there today.
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:40.000]  It's an overall example of what's happening here. The establishment is playing a multi-handed game. On the one hand, they're using Ted Cruz to block Trump, giving him some St. Hope that he could emerge as the candidate that they'd rather be with him,
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:46.000]  given his Goldman Sachs connections, his establishment roots, then Trump.
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:57.000]  You also have massive reports of voter fraud, not just in Texas, which as you know are very well publicized in the mainstream media, Travis County, Dallas County, and six other counties,
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:03.000]  but now additional evidence of fraud in Kansas, in Oklahoma.
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:15.000]  We set up an 800 number. The full lines are burning up. People are sending us videos, and it is virtually the same. It appears to be a steal in those states away from Trump,
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:26.000]  awarding votes that he did not win to either Marco Rubio, which was the case in Texas, where I suspect Carl Rove is in the house, and Ted Cruz.
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:35.000]  You have the sad fact, though, that even the establishment knows, Ted Cruz can't get to 1,237 delegates on the...
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:46.000]  So they're just scuttling it so Hillary wins, or are they planning his case? It seems very confident. He says he's going to get it and just take it when the convention happens in his home state.
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:52.000]  Well, as you know, the establishment doesn't always speak with one voice. They have competed their own internal competition.
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:58.000]  The Kennedy's and Rockefeller's both wanted to be president. They still both went to the Bilderberger meetings and sat at the CFR.
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:59.000]  Exactly.
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:09.000]  You have the same thing here. Kasich wants it. Romney wants it. Marco Rubio wants it, but Marco Rubio has got to show some lights in Florida where he's done.
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:16.000]  That's why Romney hasn't endorsed it. Romney doesn't wish success on Marco other than as a pawn to the establishment.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:22.000]  Some of this is the exact very Goldwater playbook. This is exactly what they tried to do in the South Goldwater movement.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:32.000]  And yes, I'll let you hit it on the head. If they can't have it themselves, it's ruler-ruh. If Trump is going to be the nominee, they will scuttle his nomination in a general election.
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:38.000]  They are complete traitors. Don't they endanger forever destroying the Republican Party with a move like that?
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:47.000]  Yes, but they don't care because, as we know, they're all globalists and globalist Hillary Clinton is preferable to them to nationalists Donald Trump.
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:51.000]  Particularly Donald Trump who can't be swayed by their money and their contributions.
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:57.000]  Well, two weeks ago you were here in studio and you said, you know, last night they met 75 million. It came out later.
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:04.000]  They're going to run his campaign. It came out three days later. They're going to do all this in Florida. It's now happened. They lined up all the donors.
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:11.000]  I mean, here you are, 40 years of this. You've never seen anything like it. Why are they so scared of Trump?
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:20.000]  Is Gennrich right? The quote, because he's never been in the secret society. He's not part of the club. What do you think of Gennrich's cryptic statement on that front?
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:31.000]  Yeah, I think that's exactly what's happened. I think that they are petrified that he doesn't share their anti-American or I should say anti-American sovereignty views.
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:41.000]  Look, watch for this. This is coming next. A Jeb Bush has 25 to 30 million dollars left of that Wall Street money in his super PAC.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:51.000]  Look for him to shift that money behind the anti-Trump drive. I'm told that Barbara Bush herself is calling party leaders saying Trump must be stopped
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:13:02.000]  and that the Romney case at Rubio people need to speak among themselves. And it's very clear to me, for example, that you saw in the primaries this weekend.
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:11.000]  Trump lost Maine. He lost Kansas. Both places with a much more narrow electorate where Ted Cruz simply out-organized him.
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:22.000]  But Trump was able to romp in Louisiana and Kentucky, however, by much smaller margins than the polls showed a week ago.
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:33.000]  Late-breaking voters in the Super Tuesday primary and recent primaries and sophisticated polling showed the undecided breaking late against Trump, which means...
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:36.000]  That means the targeted brainwashing is starting to work.
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:42.000]  That is exactly right. So now the question is really, the focus is really on Trump and his campaign.
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:52.000]  I do have a special report for you, and that is, we'll warm the cockles of your heart. As you know, in his press conference in Palm Beach,
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:14:03.000]  Trump said that among those he would look to for foreign policy advice was Richard Haas. This is the same Richard Haas who gave a speech just before Putin moved into Crimea saying,
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:08.000]  I don't need to worry about the Soviets. They were just a global power.
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:18.000]  As spoken to this morning by an intimate of mine at his synagogue in New York, Haas said that he would never survey President Trump, but he considered Trump a joke.
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:28.000]  So it is very clear that this attempt to get Trump to swallow Haas as an advisor was something someone put in his mind. Haas has no interest.
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:32.000]  And I would hope Trump will figure out that Haas is a globalist, is a neocon.
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:39.000]  Let's go further. It's clear. They approach him. He meets with them out of respect. They leak it knowing they're hated to hurt him.
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:43.000]  They're listening to me. The only way to destroy Trump is for them to endorse him.
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:49.000]  Well, and Haas met President Trump and now it's the Romney-style betrayal.
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:55.000]  Well, you were right. I'm not trying to kiss your romp here. It's totally true. You have called everything in royal flush spades.
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:02.000]  You said Romney was getting ready. And I know you're, I believe you, but man, you're off the reservation.
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:08.000]  A week and a half later, he does it. He now tells The Washington Times and in a speech, he says, I may, yes, I may take a broker convention.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:14.000]  If people want me, I'm going to be president. I'll take the nomination. Everything you said has come true.
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:19.000]  You were told that by sources or did you just divine that?
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:25.000]  Sources. I mean, Alex, I spent nine years in this business. I have friends working in every one of these campaigns.
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:30.000]  And in politics, people talk. I have an underground of sources in every one of these campaigns.
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:35.000]  I know people, I have friends with people globally who are working for Romney.
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:39.000]  No, I understand. You called it. Stay there, Roger. Roger, stay there. I want to come back with you.
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:42.000]  If you'll leave us a long or two, we'll take these callers so they can talk to you.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:49.000]  This is so important because the establishment is in a panic. Cardiac arrest over Trump. They want the stops.
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:56.000]  You heard it. It appears that they're finally starting to slow him. They're slowing his rise. They're cutting off his numbers.
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:05.000]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry. Our ancestors would hear the drums of war,
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:10.000]  giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:15.000]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs,
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:18.000]  they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:23.000]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:28.000]  Pathogens added to the food and water, into the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality,
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:32.000]  turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:41.000]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex. Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:47.000]  to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:50.000]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today.
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:56.000]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:04.000]  Brainforce, it's a completely different triumph bottle of it. RobDoo joins us. You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.000]  Tell us what Brainforce did.
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:11.000]  I've been working all day. I took a couple hours off coaching basketball. I get in here at 8.30.
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:14.000]  I was kind of run down. You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it.
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:18.000]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview. I got my bottle of Brainforce right there.
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:23.000]  I popped two of them and about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing, everything just kind of clears up.
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:27.000]  It's got four and a half stars. People really love it. Read about it.
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:36.000]  Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:40.000]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brainforce.
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:46.000]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brainforce and came in.
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:56.000]  You will find Brainforce and other game-changing products at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:58.000]  Hey, how you doing?
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:17:59.000]  Good, brother.
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:07.000]  I just recently started using your products. Everything you said about them is correct. Me and my wife both used a lot of them and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:12.000]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation, but doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.

[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:29.000]  We've gotten off the cheap energy drinks, energy shots, they've got a ton of money there.
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:37.000]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet and then concentrated, or maximum potency.
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:43.000]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff, just cover that up for a while, but then burn you out.
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:49.000]  In my experience, whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source, so it's pretty exciting and I love it.

[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:30.000]  Roger Stone's got to leave us after this segment, then I'll go to your calls for the balance of the broadcast and I'll be back tomorrow live, 11 a.m. Central, 12 noon Eastern for the 4-hour broadcast.
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:39.000]  But you heard him, 40 years in politics, 9 campaigns, worked in 4 administrations inside of him, highest levels, he's never seen anything like it.
[01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:46.000]  The New York Times claims, oh, Trump met with us and said it's all rhetoric. Well, that was the case, they wouldn't be going after him.
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:57.000]  Because, you know, Clinton and Bush and people told the papers it's all rhetoric and they believed it. They hate Trump for some reason and they are scared to death right now.
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:08.000]  Roger, what are the other big issues here? It's just so incredible to see Romney saying, hey, what a broker convention, to see Kasich saying it, to see them mainlining it.
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:20.000]  Kasich said, we're not men in smoky rooms, we're going to be legitimate and no matter what Trump does, we're going to take it from him. That is total 1984, double-speak, bizarro land.
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:27.000]  We're going to steal it, but we're going to do it right. They are out of control. This is just for me a referendum against the elite now.
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:37.000]  But what really scared me was, you said, the number show, and that's what I as a layman studying this saw, his wins weren't as big as they were, places he might have won by small margins.
[01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:48.000]  He lost. That tells me what we saw in Texas and other states is in. They are shaving points. They are cheating Trump to make it look legitimate at a broker convention.
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:51.000]  Tell us what you really think is going on, Roger Stone.
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:58.000]  Yeah, the good news here, of course, is this fight is far from over. As you know, I'm working with the Trump ballot security project.
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:09.000]  We've set up, as I told you, a toll-free number where we're getting reports. Recognize that if we can find enough documentation of vote stealing, we can challenge the crew's delegates in the credentials committee at the convention.
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:16.000]  We can move to unseat stolen delegates in Texas, Kansas, Kentucky and other states, despite as far from over.
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:20.000]  I'm working with many veterans of the Ron Paul operation and others.
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:28.000]  So I'm going back to Reagan to put together a strategy to stop the steal for those who want to support our efforts.
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:37.000]  Or if anybody knows the voter fraud or irregularity, you can go to stopthesteal.org and you can help us. You can contact us.
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:42.000]  You can send us videotapes. You can send us photos. And of course, you can make a contribution.
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:51.000]  We are doing really what the Trump campaign doesn't seem to be doing in this space. We hope to have poll watchers, trained poll watchers in every site in Florida.
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:58.000]  Believe me, I know Florida has been involved in the recount. If we don't do this, they will steal the state from Marco Rubio.
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:05.000]  So this is prophylactic, as well as looking at some of the big voter irregularities that we've already seen.
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:15.000]  This is Armageddon. This is the fight. And we need folks to get down in there. Trump, I think, has to articulate in more specific terms his agenda.
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:23.000]  He has to romp in Ohio and Florida. He does that. I think it will be very hard to steal this.
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:33.000]  He wins one of two. He's still in a fight for his life, but it's a fight he can win. If he loses both, we are headed to a brokerage convention in which they will try to steal it from him.
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:40.000]  Will it help having listeners put pressure on the Ocon Talk Show hosts, the media, the government, that we're not going to put up with this being stolen?
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:51.000]  We know what's happening. Would it help or would it be seen as sour grapes to have Trump come out once there's news reports and say, look, they're shaving votes for a brokerage convention?
[01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:56.000]  Romney, in case you can admit they want to steal and ignore your popular vote, he has them on tape.
[01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:03.000]  Shouldn't he produce ads that are just Internet-only so everybody can run them, showing that they admit they're stealing it?
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:11.000]  Look, there's many things I think the Trump campaign should be doing, but at this juncture, he's come a long way, and this is within his grasp.
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:20.000]  And the panic level of those who would steal it from him has reached levels of hysteria. We had his rallies being compared to Nuremberg's rallies.
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:29.000]  Glenn Beck is on TV saying he's Hitler. It's just amazing. What do you think about Glenn Beck saying he wants to stab Donald Trump?
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:38.000]  There's no different than this political consultant out of Tallahassee, this fellow Wilson, saying he wants to pull a bullet in Trump.
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:46.000]  He's an honored commentator on CNN. He goes on to accuse my friend Ian Coulter of having anal sex with Donald Trump for her support.
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:53.000]  Yeah, the New York Times says kill Trump. I mean, I don't want to kill anybody, but if I talk like that, I get arrested and I should.
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:56.000]  Why are they allowed to have calls to action to violence?
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:05.000]  Because they are the insiders. This is elite deviance. As you know, folks like the Bushes and the Romani's and others break the law with impunity.
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:13.000]  They're so connected, so wired. And at the end of the day, they are all in the same tent as we have said time and time again.
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:20.000]  The establishment, if they can't voice Romani upon it, or case it. And I think at this point, those are the two options.
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:27.000]  This is an intramural power struggle within the insider clique. They're not all united behind one ambition.
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:32.000]  So this is an elite civil war. Trump has triggered an elite civil war.
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:42.000]  Well, everybody sees an opportunity to be the savior of the establishment wing so that the lobbyists and the insiders can gorge on our tax money for another...
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:55.000]  Exactly. A, what's coming next? Rubio and Cruz and now, of course, Romani say that the media is shitting on bombshells about Trump.
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:26:03.000]  What are those supposed bombshells? That what he's not a pedophile, he's into women, so he's bad. I mean, what's the big bombshell?
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:06.000]  Look, I don't think they have any bombshells. We've seen the best shot they've got.
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:10.000]  If I see one more tell that you're talking about Trump University, I'm going to bomb it.
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:16.000]  This is very simple. It was a real estate court. 98% of the people who took it were happy, were satisfied.
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:20.000]  Most of them went on to make money. A few disgruntled people...
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:26.000]  I know. I'm giving $10 bills to homeless. I'm giving $10 bills to homeless and they bet you it's not a 20.
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:31.000]  Right, exactly. So that's what you have. This is a nothing issue. Trump's exactly right.
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:36.000]  When this goes to court in a civil case, he will triumph. He will win. It's all bogus.
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:43.000]  As I said on the show, the New York Attorney General, Eric Schneider, actually went to Trump and his daughter and said,
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:48.000]  I have this case. Trump University, you've got some complaints. I can make this all go away.
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:52.000]  I wouldn't worry about it. How many tickets are you buying to my next fundraiser?
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:57.000]  And when they refused to buy, he brought this case. That is a fact.
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:02.000]  Unbelievable. No, he said that on TV. I mean, Trump wouldn't say that unless it was true.
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:06.000]  He just butt-sued off. I tell you, it's incredible. We only got two minutes left.
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:12.000]  I want to ask Roger Schoen, again, the consummate Trump insider. This is obviously an epic moment.
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:17.000]  Edge of our seats. Americans are sitting in polls. It's the wildest election ever.
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:20.000]  I only expect you to get more crazy.
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:26.000]  Well, look, I've just been handed a report that we now have over 217 people, witnesses,
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:30.000]  who say they saw cruise boaters loading more than once in Kansas.
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:36.000]  So as the piece you've just posted says, Tricky Ted, people who are Liberty-minded conservatives,
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:41.000]  need to understand, is of the Bushes. George W. Bush's chief issue advisor.
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:46.000]  Donald Trump is long. He didn't just push John Robert. He recruited him for the Bush administration.
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:52.000]  His wife, Heidi, top deputy to Condoleezza Rice, deputy national security advisor
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:56.000]  when we rushed to the Iraq War. Then she went over to the U.S. Trade Representative office,
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:01.000]  working as a deputy to Robert Zelik, whose name should be Zelik,
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:06.000]  because whether it's Carter, Bush, or Obama, this guy stays in office.
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:09.000]  He's part of the permanent government.
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:13.000]  Some people say Zelik is the architect of 9-11.
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:16.000]  There are many people who believe that, and I think it's entirely possible.
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:21.000]  Look, I'm unfamiliar with his role with 9-11, but I put nothing past the establishment.
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:26.000]  At a minimum, I know that there's so many influence there.
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000]  That has been hidden from us.
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:31.000]  So the point here is, watch Michigan.
[01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000]  Trump's lead there in the polls down to five.
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:36.000]  K-6 may bump Romney there.
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:41.000]  He could win there in Ohio to breathe life in his chance to be the candidate of the kingmaker.
[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000]  All right. Roger Stone, thank you.
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:47.000]  We'll talk to you more this week with a weekday show, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. central.
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:50.000]  Thank you so much. Stonezone.com. We'll talk to you soon. Thank you.
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000]  Alex, victory or death?
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000]  Yeah, victory or death, liberty or death.
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:29:23.000]  We'll be back with your phone calls in three minutes.
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:25.000]  We'll be back.
[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:28.000]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products,

[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:36.000]  Look, there's a reason deep cleanse is the only product on the market

[01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:05.000]  Our listeners over the past two years tried X2 nascent iodine and experienced it for themselves.
[01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:08.000]  I basically had my gallbladder out within the last nine months,
[01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:14.000]  needed to get my digestive system working correctly again, so I stumbled on the X2.
[01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:18.000]  When we look at a product like Survival Shield nascent iodine X2,
[01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:22.000]  it's something that really has been hiding in plain view for over a hundred years.
[01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:27.000]  I needed a deep talk, basically. I started taking X2 first for about seven days,
[01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000]  and then I did the deep cleanse.
[01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:32.000]  I want to challenge the listeners who have not tried X2 for yourselves.
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:36.000]  What do you have to lose? You are the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty,
[01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:40.000]  and you're getting a high-quality product that has absolutely changed my life

[01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:02.000]  Tell folks how you got introduced to Super Male, and then when Super Female came out, tell us what happened.
[01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:07.000]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:08.000]  Talk about the effects.
[01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:12.000]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning. I have drive to go to the gym.
[01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:16.000]  I feel like I look better. I feel better. I feel sexier. I love it.
[01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:19.000]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.

[01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:28.000]  The Empire is on the Run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:33.000]  Yeah, when I saw that Benedict Arnold Lenzack come out against Trump, I knew that
[01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:36.000]  I had to keep supporting Trump. Trump's not perfect.
[01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000]  We'll try to keep him honest.
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:41.000]  Every sack of garbage from Tony Blair.
[01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:45.000]  Tony Blair says he thinks that Trump's dangerous, but also that he's entertaining.
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:50.000]  I tell you what's entertaining was you faking all that intelligence on Iraq to buy them for Saudi Arabia
[01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:53.000]  in 9-11 and then killing over a million Iraqis.
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:59.000]  And Madeleine Albright on TV saying 500,000 dead Iraqi children was a good price to pay.
[01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:04.000]  Two guys on TV talking about killing half a million kids and how good you are.
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:07.000]  Hell, let's give an award to Jeffrey Dahmer then.
[01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:11.000]  He's humanitarian compared to you people.
[01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000]  Man, you folks are sick.
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:22.000]  You make your jokes up there like we don't see it or hear it.
[01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:23.000]  I'll be honest.
[01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:27.000]  I was getting depressed here and the back was getting ready to go belly up and bankrupt and the rest of it.
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000]  But now I just say good riddance, man.
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:39.000]  Him on Stephanopoulos, that Clinton operative washing Stephanopoulos' feet couldn't be any more obvious.
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:46.000]  What a sick group the Republican establishment is.
[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:52.000]  The Kentucky senator, the senior senator from Kentucky, the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell,
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:56.000]  saying we'd rather have Hillary Clinton than Donald Trump.
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:57.000]  Well, you know what?
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:58.000]  I'm for Donald Trump.
[01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:01.000]  Even if he does stuff I don't like the fact that you hate him so much.
[01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000]  And let me tell you, people say, well, that's a ruse.
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000]  They're playing that to make you support Trump.
[01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:06.000]  No, they're not.
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:14.000]  They are pulling their hair out because they're in a sick club and there's something about Trump they know they don't like.
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:22.000]  Maybe it's that Trump's youngest son isn't out in public a lot.
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:25.000]  Maybe Trump's youngest son got damaged with vaccines.
[01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000]  Maybe they got CIA reports on him.
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000]  Maybe they know what he really talks about.
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:35.000]  Maybe they know what Trump really knows.
[01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:40.000]  Maybe they know he's not a parasite who wants to hurt people.
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:46.000]  And just because of that, they want him destroyed.
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:50.000]  We're going to find out, aren't we?
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:53.000]  Let's go to Dan and then we're going to go to Cindy and others.
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:56.000]  Dan, thanks for holding from Washington. You're on the air.
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:00.000]  Hey, Alex. Long time listener, first time caller, man.
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:01.000]  I've loved you for years.
[01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000]  Love you, brother.
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:07.000]  Do you still watch you in Austin on public access, actually?
[01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000]  That's where I started 21 years ago.
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:14.000]  I heard Ron Paul came out against Trump.
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:18.000]  I just want to say disappointed Ron Paul.
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:32.000]  I think kind of basically we need a populism and nationalist movement more than libertarianism because I think libertarian like Glenn Beck has been completely hijacked.
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:35.000]  Wow, that's really a suit of you.
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000]  Look, look, look, it's nationalism.
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:42.000]  It's Trump's like they got 20 plus percent tariffs on us internally in China with their currency.
[01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:45.000]  They won't do it. I'll put a tariff on them to match it.
[01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:49.000]  That's not protectionism. That's level playing field.
[01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:52.000]  That's what scares them is that Trump actually wants to do things.
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:55.000]  And look, Ron Paul is a purist. I can admire that.
[01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:56.000]  He comes on the show every month.
[01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:01.000]  You know, I'm a big supporter, but it is a cheap shot.
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:08.000]  You know, to just, you know, just sit there and just make the easy statement.
[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:11.000]  Because I saw him on, I think it was Fox.
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:20.000]  He goes, well, you know, Trump, sure, let's bash Trump for the KKK, but, you know, isn't the media, you know, blah, blah, blah.
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000]  So he kind of halfway went along with that.
[01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000]  And there's no point to do that.
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:29.000]  Obviously they hate Trump because the nationalism and I get the fact he isn't perfect on every issue.
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:33.000]  Well, Rand Paul didn't follow Ron Paul on every issue.
[01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000]  So we're going to throw him out of the mix too.
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000]  That's what I'm getting at.
[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:43.000]  Yeah, I think I, I mean, I like that became a lot longer than I liked Ron Paul.
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:55.000]  I liked audit the Fed and I liked the anti-war stuff, but a lot of the libertarian stuff as far as the open borders and the, you know, free trade kind of stuff.
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000]  I'm just not into, you know, so.
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:01.000]  Well, yeah, that's the extreme libertarianism of Peter Thiel.
[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000]  And then that's what we're getting at.
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:08.000]  Mexico can't have rules on us and not get free welfare away, but we do.
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000]  It's called being fair.
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:19.000]  I mean, I was reading where the U.S. holds refugee centers all over the Middle East and Latin America, where we pay to bring the refugees to stage them.
[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000]  That's in my stack to fly them in.
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000]  Why am I supposed to pay for everybody?
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000]  They go, well, you're white.
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:29.000]  And at a certain point it's meant, I guess, to balkanize me and make me a racist.
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:33.000]  I'm not going to be a racist, but I'm not going to go along with the globalist policies.
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:34.000]  Thanks for the call, Dan.
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:35.000]  Great points.
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:39.000]  Cindy, we're going to talk to Cindy, Cynthia, in Pennsylvania.
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000]  You're on the air.
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:42.000]  Hi, Alex.
[01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:43.000]  Hi, welcome.
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:44.000]  Thanks for holding.
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:47.000]  Yeah, the voting box is supposed to be our voice.
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:53.000]  They've done everything over the years to take that away from us with their delegates and their super delicates.
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:56.000]  Now, I think I know what they're afraid of with Trump.
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:59.000]  Trump could be the death knell to the New World Order.
[01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:04.000]  He could put so many people in jail, not just Hillary.
[01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:10.000]  There's so many people in the government that should be in jail right now, and only Trump can do that.
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000]  And I believe he will do that.
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:16.000]  And last night, I watched Judge Jeanine Pirro, Justice for Judge Jeanine.
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:23.000]  She laid that out in her open about Romney. It is so good. I wish you could put that up on your show.
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000]  Sure. Where did you see that?
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:28.000]  Justice with Judge Jeanine.
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000]  That's on Fox.
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000]  She doesn't open in the beginning.
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:36.000]  Guys, look up on Fox, the opening of Justice with Judge Jeanine.
[01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:37.000]  I know she is.
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000]  I know she has a show and I don't have time to watch it.
[01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:42.000]  Watch more TV in the morning, but we'll look into that.
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:51.000]  Are you telling me you believe in the conspiracy theory that if they have a broker convention and he has a thousand delegates
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:40:00.000]  and Ted Cruz has 400, or Romney has none and they give the nomination to Romney with no delegates?
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:05.000]  You're saying it's stealing to take people's popular vote and ignore it?
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:08.000]  That's racist, okay?
[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:21.000]  If Trump has a thousand and Cruz has 500 and Rubio has 200 in case it has 100 and Romney has zero, that means Romney wins.
[01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000]  Don't be a conspiracy theorist.
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:26.000]  If you have a business, you didn't build it.
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000]  If you wrote a book, you didn't write it.
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:31.000]  If you paint a painting, you didn't paint it.
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:34.000]  Healthcare is free under Obamacare.
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:38.000]  Two plus two equals five. Raising the debt limit doesn't raise the debt.
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:45.000]  Ma'am, do I have to send by some political correctness officers to make sure you're not an extremist or a terrorist?
[01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:51.000]  Are you telling me that a broker convention is a theft?
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:55.000]  Well, the truth is, they're right about one thing.
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000]  Donald Trump is very dangerous.
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:58.000]  Very dangerous.
[01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:04.000]  Yeah, well, maybe I'll say he doesn't exist, and if you say he ever existed, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:08.000]  They're now in some areas of the country teaching mothers and fathers never existed.
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000]  Not just don't use the term in America.
[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:13.000]  They didn't exist, and I agree.
[01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:14.000]  I'm mainstream media.
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000]  I agree with George Stephanopoulos.
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:21.000]  Fathers and mothers never existed, and you didn't build your business.
[01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:25.000]  And if you don't agree with me, you're a racist and a conspiracy theorist.
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000]  Thank you, Cindy, for your extremism.
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:32.000]  Rusty in Arkansas, former state, I guess, in FEMA Region 6.
[01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:35.000]  Rusty, Arkansas never existed.
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:36.000]  Do you extreme?
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000]  Let's go ahead.
[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000]  Yeah, we never existed.
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:41.000]  Bill Clinton made sure of that.
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:48.000]  Yeah, I just wanted to say, Alex, their playlist, and you need to be taking X2 Survival Shield.
[01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:49.000]  It's a great product.
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:52.000]  Support the movement by these products.
[01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:56.000]  Another question I have for you, Alex, is I know we need to stop for Trump.
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:59.000]  How can we support Ventura when he's an atheist?
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:00.000]  I mean, you love God.
[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000]  How can we support Ventura?
[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:03.000]  I'll be honest with you.
[01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:06.000]  Ventura doesn't have a snowball stance in hella winning.
[01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:07.000]  He's a real guy.
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:10.000]  He's smart in ways, not smart in others.
[01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:14.000]  He's gone through a lot of stuff, family dying and stuff, and it makes him not believe in God.
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:20.000]  I had a grandmother that believed in God by the time she died, but got hurt by her husband dying and stuff, and got mad at God.
[01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:27.000]  And, you know, Ventura just is, he's a real guy, so I like him at the same time.
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:32.000]  What I'm saying, support him to inject 9-11 truth or other issues.
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000]  The Lord works in mysterious ways.
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000]  Ventura is a good person.
[01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000]  He's just, he's just as conflicted.
[01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:41.000]  Does that make sense in my opinion?
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000]  That makes sense.
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000]  Just pray for him.
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:46.000]  You want to add anything else?
[01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000]  I don't want to cut you off early.
[01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:52.000]  No, that's fine. Stop the Trump, everybody. Go vote for Trump. God bless.
[01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:57.000]  Absolutely. Trump believes in God, at least he professes it. That's an offender.
[01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:00.000]  Extra, Extra. Read all about it.
[01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:06.000]  The New York Daily News has published the complete guide to fleeing Donald Trump's America.
[01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:10.000]  This is the liberal response to a potential Donald Trump presidency,
[01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:15.000]  and they are claiming that left-leaning Americans all across the nation
[01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:20.000]  on packing it up and leaving the country should Donald Trump become president.
[01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:25.000]  The guide comes complete with a list of the cheapest and friendliest countries to run to.
[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:31.000]  It also shows you how to get a work visa and how to make new friends in your new environment.
[01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:37.000]  And there's even a list of celebrities who say they will leave the country if Trump wins the election.
[01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:44.000]  People like Rosie O'Donnell, Whoopi Goldberg, Jonathan Stewart, Samuel L. Jackson, and the Reverend Al Sharpton.
[01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:49.000]  They say they are leaving the country if Donald Trump becomes president of the United States.
[01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:53.000]  And we need to get behind this, and we need to support it.
[01:43:53.000 --> 01:44:15.000]  We'll learn more right now at infowars.com.

[01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:55.000]  I see people calling to my radio show and tell me how young Jebedy and the products at infowarsteam.com have changed their lives.
[01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000]  Check it out for yourself today.
[01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000]  Brain Force.
[01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:00.000]  It's completely different.
[01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:01.000]  Try a bottle of it.
[01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000]  Rob Dew joins us.
[01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:06.000]  You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:07.000]  Tell us what Brain Force did.
[01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:08.000]  I'd been working all day.
[01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000]  I get in here at 8.30.
[01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000]  I was kind of run down.
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it.
[01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:19.000]  I got my bottle of Brain Force right there.
[01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:20.000]  I popped two of them.
[01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like bing.
[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000]  Everything just kind of clears up.
[01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000]  It's got four and a half stars.
[01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:27.000]  People really love it.
[01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:28.000]  Read about it.
[01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:37.000]  Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:41.000]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000]  I went home about 6.45 this morning.
[01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:47.000]  I took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.
[01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:57.000]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:18.000]  We all are.
[01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:27.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:31.000]  Radio! Radio! Radio! Radio! Radio! Radio! Radio! Radio! Radio! Radio!
[01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:35.000]  We take the talk radio format and bring it to TV with the first to do it.
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:38.000]  About 16 years ago, and on there 21 years.
[01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:41.200]  And we just keep doing it.
[01:47:41.200 --> 01:47:48.280]  And we just want common sense, family, private property, freedom, liberalism, lower taxes,
[01:47:48.280 --> 01:47:49.720]  more freedom, more choices.
[01:47:49.720 --> 01:47:51.220]  That's liberal.
[01:47:51.220 --> 01:47:55.640]  Not people telling you what words to use or what you can say or do or where you can go.
[01:47:55.640 --> 01:47:59.800]  As long as I'm not hurting somebody else, get out of my business.
[01:47:59.800 --> 01:48:03.060]  But they're in our business.
[01:48:03.060 --> 01:48:06.440]  So now I'm in their business to get them off our backs.
[01:48:06.440 --> 01:48:13.480]  I want to talk to a Frank, Phil, Joshua, Rick, and others rich here in just a moment.
[01:48:13.480 --> 01:48:21.360]  Before I do that, they have passed a bunch of laws and regulations where I can't make
[01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:29.040]  claims about the products and enforce life.com.
[01:48:29.040 --> 01:48:31.720]  But you've noticed our knowledge about politics.
[01:48:31.720 --> 01:48:36.520]  See, I don't have 15 political pundits on every week.
[01:48:36.520 --> 01:48:40.680]  I find one that's super accurate and has the inside baseball and will tell the truth.
[01:48:40.680 --> 01:48:42.920]  They're on every day.
[01:48:42.920 --> 01:48:45.840]  There's endless guests we can get on, endless.
[01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:48.680]  People knocking down our doors to get on, obviously.
[01:48:48.680 --> 01:48:57.560]  We get economists on, politicos on, scientists on, doctors on, authors on, musicians on.
[01:48:57.560 --> 01:49:00.040]  People that tell the truth and know what they're talking about.
[01:49:00.040 --> 01:49:02.480]  Because that's who I want to hear.
[01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:05.680]  That's who I want to associate with.
[01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:12.960]  People that are trailblazers, like Matt Drudge or Joseph Farah of Roland and Daley.
[01:49:12.960 --> 01:49:17.160]  They're really going against the grain, not with just bull, but with stuff that's proven
[01:49:17.160 --> 01:49:22.760]  to be way more accurate than what the establishment's shoveling.
[01:49:22.760 --> 01:49:25.400]  And it's the same thing for colloidal silver, topically, internally.
[01:49:25.400 --> 01:49:29.880]  If you don't know what colloidal silver can do for you and your family, enforcelife.com,
[01:49:29.880 --> 01:49:34.160]  we have the nationwide bestseller that's sold at Whole Foods everywhere.
[01:49:34.160 --> 01:49:37.560]  Private labeled for us is $24 everywhere else, $25.
[01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:39.280]  It's $9.95.
[01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:40.280]  That's how capitalist I am.
[01:49:40.280 --> 01:49:44.240]  And the small profit we make funds this operation.
[01:49:44.240 --> 01:49:45.240]  It works, too.
[01:49:45.240 --> 01:49:46.240]  You sell something way lower than everybody else.
[01:49:46.240 --> 01:49:47.240]  You end up dominating the market.
[01:49:47.240 --> 01:49:53.600]  So even though it's a small profit per model, $8.96, if you sell it for auto, ship the additional
[01:49:53.600 --> 01:49:57.200]  10% off, and throw plex.
[01:49:57.200 --> 01:50:00.600]  Go research what it does with all the estrogen mimickers and all the stuff that's been to
[01:50:00.600 --> 01:50:02.680]  suppress our normal metabolic system.
[01:50:02.680 --> 01:50:05.080]  Go read what Anthroplex does.
[01:50:05.080 --> 01:50:08.160]  Go read what the other products do at enforcelife.com.
[01:50:08.160 --> 01:50:09.160]  Find out.
[01:50:09.160 --> 01:50:10.160]  Bare minimum.
[01:50:10.160 --> 01:50:11.160]  Buy the products.
[01:50:11.160 --> 01:50:12.600]  It funds the operation.
[01:50:12.600 --> 01:50:14.200]  You want to fight tyranny?
[01:50:14.200 --> 01:50:17.480]  There's nowhere you can spend your money that is more effective.
[01:50:17.480 --> 01:50:18.480]  Period.
[01:50:18.480 --> 01:50:19.480]  Period.
[01:50:19.480 --> 01:50:24.240]  And I love the fact that we're supported by people buying $25 and $30 and $9.95 bottles
[01:50:24.240 --> 01:50:26.800]  of high-quality nutraceuticals.
[01:50:26.800 --> 01:50:31.280]  And go do your own research on the ingredients and the products we have.
[01:50:31.280 --> 01:50:36.360]  And we come up with the very best we can, the purest, the strongest.
[01:50:36.360 --> 01:50:39.320]  We don't do any advertising outside of this operation.
[01:50:39.320 --> 01:50:45.080]  It's all about the product blowing your socks off.
[01:50:45.080 --> 01:50:46.840]  That's what sells it.
[01:50:46.840 --> 01:50:48.000]  People know I don't make stuff up.
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.120]  They know I only promote what I think's the best.
[01:50:50.120 --> 01:50:51.120]  You get it.
[01:50:51.120 --> 01:50:52.120]  You have a big effect.
[01:50:52.120 --> 01:50:53.120]  You keep buying it.
[01:50:53.120 --> 01:50:55.320]  That funds us fighting globalists.
[01:50:55.320 --> 01:50:59.240]  So win, win, win, win, win.
[01:50:59.240 --> 01:51:05.240]  I am neurotic, folks, and everybody knows that I will not screw anybody over.
[01:51:05.240 --> 01:51:09.080]  Even my enemies, I feel bad stepping on them when I have to to defend my family.
[01:51:09.080 --> 01:51:10.080]  But I do it.
[01:51:10.080 --> 01:51:14.840]  I do it quickly and decisively.
[01:51:14.840 --> 01:51:18.840]  But I don't take pleasure out of crushing people.
[01:51:18.840 --> 01:51:21.680]  I do what I have to do on a mission.
[01:51:21.680 --> 01:51:25.280]  And if I tell you, let me tell you, it tortures me to listen to some of the third-party advertising
[01:51:25.280 --> 01:51:26.520]  on affiliates or wherever.
[01:51:26.520 --> 01:51:27.520]  I'm not knocking them.
[01:51:27.520 --> 01:51:28.520]  They don't know.
[01:51:28.520 --> 01:51:29.520]  Ad agencies buy it.
[01:51:29.520 --> 01:51:32.400]  People think ads you hear on the network or on stations are mine.
[01:51:32.400 --> 01:51:34.440]  If an ad's there, I'm endorsing it.
[01:51:34.440 --> 01:51:38.400]  And what I endorse, I believe in and know has worked for me and is incredible.
[01:51:38.400 --> 01:51:46.320]  Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com, or call toll-free, 888-253-3139, whether it's non-GMO
[01:51:46.320 --> 01:51:51.680]  seeds or water filtration systems or Hillary for present t-shirts, the fight against global
[01:51:51.680 --> 01:51:53.680]  tyranny starts at Infowars.
[01:51:53.680 --> 01:51:58.880]  And the war purse, the war bonds that fund it is Infowarslife.com and Infowarsstore.com.
[01:51:58.880 --> 01:52:04.560]  And I want to thank all of you that have supported us, that have spread the word about the broadcast,
[01:52:04.560 --> 01:52:07.600]  that have prayed for us, and that have bought the products.
[01:52:07.600 --> 01:52:12.000]  Praying for us is just as important or more important than spreading the word or even
[01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:13.000]  buying the products.
[01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.680]  In fact, unequivocally, it's more important.
[01:52:15.680 --> 01:52:18.120]  So thank you for your prayers, first and foremost.
[01:52:18.120 --> 01:52:23.280]  We don't believe in them, we rely on them, and I can feel them, and I don't deserve
[01:52:23.280 --> 01:52:24.280]  them.
[01:52:24.280 --> 01:52:29.560]  If I could feel your good souls turn towards me, I'm turned towards you, you got a commitment
[01:52:29.560 --> 01:52:32.760]  that I'll fight these people to the death.
[01:52:32.760 --> 01:52:36.400]  I could barely contain the energy I've got to fight them in this body.
[01:52:36.400 --> 01:52:40.000]  I'm here, I'm with you, I want to go all the way.
[01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.960]  I'm never going to submit or surrender.
[01:52:42.960 --> 01:52:44.480]  You've got a commitment right there.
[01:52:44.480 --> 01:52:49.520]  Now, I may blow up, I may run off the road, I may flip and blow into flames, but no, I
[01:52:49.520 --> 01:52:50.520]  did it all.
[01:52:50.520 --> 01:52:51.520]  Press it down that accelerator.
[01:52:51.520 --> 01:52:56.520]  I'm going to take four more calls, means we give each car about a minute and a half.
[01:52:56.520 --> 01:52:59.040]  Frank in New York, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:52:59.040 --> 01:53:01.720]  Hey Alex, how are you?
[01:53:01.720 --> 01:53:02.720]  Good brother.
[01:53:02.720 --> 01:53:05.440]  God bless you and your crew and your family.
[01:53:05.440 --> 01:53:06.440]  Thank you, you too.
[01:53:06.440 --> 01:53:07.440]  Okay.
[01:53:07.440 --> 01:53:10.920]  Basically, I've been trying to call you for weeks now about tech crews.
[01:53:10.920 --> 01:53:14.720]  There's one thing I don't know if you knew about this, that he was one of the deciding
[01:53:14.720 --> 01:53:21.160]  votes for the fast track, which I believe leads to, isn't that leads to immigration as
[01:53:21.160 --> 01:53:22.160]  well?
[01:53:22.160 --> 01:53:24.040]  Like open borders, am I correct or am I wrong?
[01:53:24.040 --> 01:53:25.040]  No, that's right.
[01:53:25.040 --> 01:53:27.640]  In the end, he supported TPP.
[01:53:27.640 --> 01:53:32.280]  I know, I wanted to believe in Ted Cruz, but he's a smooth operator and I don't want to,
[01:53:32.280 --> 01:53:35.840]  I mean, he's certainly better than Hillary Clinton, but yeah, he's a chip off the old
[01:53:35.840 --> 01:53:36.840]  block.
[01:53:36.840 --> 01:53:42.320]  And I don't know if you know about Stephen Miller, he needs actually a trusted aide
[01:53:42.320 --> 01:53:45.160]  from Jennifer, for Senator Jeff Sessions.
[01:53:45.160 --> 01:53:48.640]  He was actually one who exposed it, actually, that's what I actually heard it from, believe
[01:53:48.640 --> 01:53:49.640]  it or not.
[01:53:49.640 --> 01:53:52.080]  No, I'd love to get Senator Sessions on, let's see if we can do that.
[01:53:52.080 --> 01:53:55.600]  Yeah, no, Senator Sessions is a really good person.
[01:53:55.600 --> 01:53:59.960]  You can just see it when he gives a speech, but his voting record, they claim he's all
[01:53:59.960 --> 01:54:00.960]  about immigration.
[01:54:00.960 --> 01:54:01.960]  He doesn't obsess about that.
[01:54:01.960 --> 01:54:04.280]  He just says you got to have people come in legally.
[01:54:04.280 --> 01:54:09.920]  He's obsessed about TPP and all of it, and that was good for Trump to bring up TPP during
[01:54:09.920 --> 01:54:13.200]  the, he's his own man, that's why they hate him.
[01:54:13.200 --> 01:54:14.760]  He really is his own man.
[01:54:14.760 --> 01:54:17.000]  He might even be an ego maniac and not that good.
[01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:20.280]  I'm not saying that, but he's his own guy and they hate it.
[01:54:20.280 --> 01:54:21.280]  What do you say to that?
[01:54:21.280 --> 01:54:22.280]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:54:22.280 --> 01:54:23.280]  I totally agree with you.
[01:54:23.280 --> 01:54:25.280]  He's the only chance we got.
[01:54:25.280 --> 01:54:30.400]  Unfortunately, he's not person like nobody is, but I definitely don't want Hillary Clinton.
[01:54:30.400 --> 01:54:32.000]  I definitely don't want Rubio O'Cruz.
[01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:33.000]  I agree.
[01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.800]  I got to jump to other collars, but he, they call him a flip flopper.
[01:54:35.800 --> 01:54:40.240]  No, he admits what he's wrong and says, no, I get it now.
[01:54:40.240 --> 01:54:44.040]  We not torturing a guy who has a bomb and we want to know what the other bomb is.
[01:54:44.040 --> 01:54:45.040]  It's illegal.
[01:54:45.040 --> 01:54:46.040]  Okay, I get it.
[01:54:46.040 --> 01:54:47.040]  I'm wrong.
[01:54:47.040 --> 01:54:48.040]  I'm sorry.
[01:54:48.040 --> 01:54:50.040]  And then he goes, oh, I wanted to bring in immigrants because they were, they're being, I thought
[01:54:50.040 --> 01:54:51.040]  there was Christians.
[01:54:51.040 --> 01:54:53.040]  I thought we're bringing Christians in killed by radical Muslims.
[01:54:53.040 --> 01:54:54.540]  You're bringing radical Muslims in?
[01:54:54.540 --> 01:54:56.040]  Stop them all till you've had them.
[01:54:56.040 --> 01:54:57.920]  They go, oh, first you're wrong to bring them in.
[01:54:57.920 --> 01:54:58.920]  Now you're this racist.
[01:54:58.920 --> 01:54:59.920]  No, it's common sense.
[01:54:59.920 --> 01:55:04.200]  So the fact that he does that, you can see, I know, not just stone with a bunch of folks
[01:55:04.200 --> 01:55:05.960]  knowing, literally Trump's running his own show.
[01:55:05.960 --> 01:55:06.960]  They hate that.
[01:55:06.960 --> 01:55:09.040]  The controlling groups hate that.
[01:55:09.040 --> 01:55:10.920]  Let's talk to Phil in Arizona.
[01:55:10.920 --> 01:55:11.920]  You're on the air.
[01:55:11.920 --> 01:55:12.920]  Go ahead.
[01:55:12.920 --> 01:55:13.920]  Hey.
[01:55:13.920 --> 01:55:14.920]  Hey, Alex.
[01:55:14.920 --> 01:55:15.920]  Yes, sir.
[01:55:15.920 --> 01:55:20.800]  Hey, yo, I just want to give a shout out to all the info warriors out there.
[01:55:20.800 --> 01:55:26.400]  First of all, and second of all, I don't know what's up with Glenn Dex, STD and Phil
[01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:31.200]  in mind, but he is completely insane going against Donald Trump.
[01:55:31.200 --> 01:55:36.680]  He knows that he can defeat the globalist and he knows Donald Trump knows that there's
[01:55:36.680 --> 01:55:43.600]  26 or 24 pages missing from the 9-11 commission and he's going to expose that.
[01:55:43.600 --> 01:55:44.600]  That's right.
[01:55:44.600 --> 01:55:46.040]  Look, I'm going to give out the inside baseball now.
[01:55:46.040 --> 01:55:47.040]  I just decided to do it.
[01:55:47.040 --> 01:55:51.920]  I was told by a Rolling Stone reporter and by other high level reporters that they have
[01:55:51.920 --> 01:55:58.080]  incredible material on Glenn Beck of a Rubio type nature and that Glenn Beck is blackmailed.
[01:55:58.080 --> 01:56:02.560]  And then that information was not put out by the White House of Media Matters because
[01:56:02.560 --> 01:56:05.600]  Glenn Beck is basically taking orders from the White House there.
[01:56:05.600 --> 01:56:07.760]  I just want to have to set it because I'm sick of him.
[01:56:07.760 --> 01:56:12.040]  I've done this for years, but that's what high level folks told me.
[01:56:12.040 --> 01:56:13.040]  Glenn Beck is blackmailed.
[01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:18.680]  And I'm just telling you, dude, I'm telling you fucking, I mean, I'm going to let you
[01:56:18.680 --> 01:56:19.680]  go because of that.
[01:56:19.680 --> 01:56:20.680]  We got to delay that.
[01:56:20.680 --> 01:56:22.760]  Guys, we cannot do cussing on air.
[01:56:22.760 --> 01:56:24.240]  I'm an FCC show.
[01:56:24.240 --> 01:56:25.480]  I'm on commercial stations.
[01:56:25.480 --> 01:56:27.280]  Don't do it or you just cut yourself off the ear.
[01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:29.320]  Joshua and Floral is trying to go to Rich.
[01:56:29.320 --> 01:56:30.320]  Go ahead.
[01:56:30.320 --> 01:56:32.440]  Brother, love your show.
[01:56:32.440 --> 01:56:37.800]  I wanted to talk to you about, you know, you've been bringing up this statinism and when
[01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:42.040]  you go down the rabbit hole, we find all these statinists and devil worshipers in these secret
[01:56:42.040 --> 01:56:43.040]  societies.
[01:56:43.040 --> 01:56:48.520]  And I wanted to tell you your spot on and I witnessed it first hand accidentally I was
[01:56:48.520 --> 01:56:53.920]  down in the Amazon jungle on an Iowa street and I had this shaman.
[01:56:53.920 --> 01:56:59.000]  He was saying that he was channeling interdimensional beings that were giving him blueprint to build
[01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:04.600]  a pyramid in the middle of the Amazon river and he's funding this now and it's in construction.
[01:57:04.600 --> 01:57:10.680]  So I just, I want to tell you that as crazy as it is, you know, reality is stranger than
[01:57:10.680 --> 01:57:11.680]  the wild as fiction.
[01:57:11.680 --> 01:57:12.680]  That's what the Bible says.
[01:57:12.680 --> 01:57:13.680]  Pharmakia is witchcraft.
[01:57:13.680 --> 01:57:17.640]  It could be fun and all this stuff, but when you really get down to it, everybody has the
[01:57:17.640 --> 01:57:18.640]  same experiences.
[01:57:18.640 --> 01:57:22.320]  There's all these other dimensions and that's what the elite believe, whether it's real
[01:57:22.320 --> 01:57:27.520]  or not, they believe they're getting demonic power through this other dimension into this
[01:57:27.520 --> 01:57:28.520]  one.
[01:57:28.520 --> 01:57:29.920]  But we're only on a planet in deep space.
[01:57:29.920 --> 01:57:31.120]  I'm sure none of that's happening.
[01:57:31.120 --> 01:57:32.120]  Everything's fine.
[01:57:32.120 --> 01:57:33.120]  Right?
[01:57:33.120 --> 01:57:34.120]  I'm sorry to Rich.
[01:57:34.120 --> 01:57:35.120]  I'm out of time.
[01:57:35.120 --> 01:57:36.120]  Call me back, Rich.
[01:57:36.120 --> 01:57:37.120]  We'll go to the Heath of the Line next time.
[01:57:37.120 --> 01:57:38.120]  Great job to the crew.
[01:57:38.120 --> 01:57:41.240]  We've been up here since noon today working so much is coming up this week.
[01:57:41.240 --> 01:57:43.880]  Big broadcast this week, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.
[01:57:43.880 --> 01:57:46.160]  Please tell your friends, your family, everybody to tune in.
[01:57:46.160 --> 01:57:48.160]  Revolution starts here.
