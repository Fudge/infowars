[00:00.000 --> 00:22.400]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well so does he live
[00:22.400 --> 00:49.560]  from Austin Texas Broadcasting Worldwide it's Alex Jones
[00:49.560 --> 00:58.360]  Wow they say that John the revelator in the Isle of Patmos when he was given the revelation
[00:58.360 --> 01:06.520]  marveled at the beast and the beast system well you're living it ladies and gentlemen
[01:06.520 --> 01:13.880]  so you can certainly certainly marvel now I'm going to cover all this news and information
[01:13.880 --> 01:20.400]  today if the hair lips the admiral as they used to say more of the water done rise over
[01:20.400 --> 01:29.400]  Bear Creek yes that's an old Western saying but let me just tell you what we got here
[01:29.400 --> 01:40.200]  in the hopper for you our leader our king our master since Bill Gates receded last six
[01:40.200 --> 01:46.360]  months is the CEO Pfizer and Trump has come out and said basically the CEO of Pfizer has
[01:46.360 --> 01:50.720]  more power than the US president runs the world today which is true he's now the head
[01:50.720 --> 01:57.160]  guy what he says goes and foutsies like his little demonic ventriloquist doll and he said
[01:57.160 --> 02:01.680]  a few weeks ago oh we don't care what the FDA scientists say or the CDC scientists say
[02:01.680 --> 02:06.120]  that shouldn't have boosters and the vaccines aren't working and shouldn't give it to under
[02:06.120 --> 02:11.960]  16 he just said we're going to go ahead with it and sure as hell they went ahead with it
[02:11.960 --> 02:16.840]  because he's our ruler he's our boss going back six seven years ago Klaus Schwab at Davos
[02:16.840 --> 02:21.560]  it was in the front page of Bloomberg said hey in the future very near future in the
[02:21.560 --> 02:28.080]  next ten years we will have CEOs running the planet and corporate leaders and national
[02:28.080 --> 02:34.400]  leaders will be vestigial and ceremonial if they're even still existing that's basically
[02:34.400 --> 02:38.880]  a paraphrase that's what he said tell you go to Wikipedia page he says it says we're
[02:38.880 --> 02:42.640]  going to take over all your governments and have captured your governments so that's where
[02:42.640 --> 02:46.920]  we are and then they just have this peanut gallery of leftist empowered on social media
[02:46.920 --> 02:52.760]  just gaslight everybody says it's not happening but it is happening so Pfizer CEO says the
[02:52.760 --> 02:56.840]  lockdown will never end normal life won't come back for those that refuse to take the
[02:56.840 --> 03:02.560]  shots and he goes on to say you will not be able to live without the vaccines I don't
[03:02.560 --> 03:08.560]  think this means we should be able to live our lives without having vaccinations basically
[03:08.560 --> 03:16.920]  what an announcement corporate dictator of the world CEO of Pfizer says you shouldn't
[03:16.920 --> 03:20.520]  be able to live your life without vaccines you can't live your life without these shots
[03:20.520 --> 03:25.440]  what a precedent because the end game goal is getting in our bodies and owning our bodies
[03:25.440 --> 03:30.200]  and Klaus Schwab and all of them tell us this revolution to take over our bodies and sterilize
[03:30.200 --> 03:36.000]  us you see they've got life extension technology now they can't make you live forever but they
[03:36.000 --> 03:41.320]  can make you live 30 40 50 years longer if they start you by 40 or 50 years old the science
[03:41.320 --> 03:44.600]  shows you know they're more advanced than what they're even telling us so that's just
[03:44.600 --> 03:48.680]  what we currently know if you can then have an extended 20 30 years well you can certainly
[03:48.680 --> 03:55.320]  then extend it to 500 years a thousand years you won't really be a human anymore but they
[03:55.320 --> 04:02.320]  think that's a form of life when it's really a form of fancy high-tech taxidermy in my
[04:02.320 --> 04:08.000]  view so we're going to lay it all out today and I can tell you that I am a particularly
[04:08.000 --> 04:17.040]  aligned today with the big spirit as they say the great spirit and so I'm going to really
[04:17.040 --> 04:23.200]  try to just cover as much information as I can today I'm also the national health minister
[04:23.200 --> 04:29.480]  of Australia went further than the Pfizer king and said oh the lockdowns never in and
[04:29.480 --> 04:33.640]  the shots never in which we already knew I told you 20 months ago and this whole started
[04:33.640 --> 04:37.400]  it'll never end all I told you 10 years ago and reports I put out they'll never end we
[04:37.400 --> 04:42.880]  have other documents but now it's here that's just one little stack right here and then
[04:42.880 --> 04:49.040]  we've got a lot of election Arizona news it's huge and then an amazing consortium of articles
[04:49.040 --> 04:53.320]  gaslighting people saying don't believe the truth believe lies I'm not kidding nothing
[04:53.320 --> 04:58.840]  embracing the lie is good we'll cover that we come back in T minus 60 seconds on this
[04:58.840 --> 05:07.080]  live September 27th Monday transmission I have the greatest sense of loss deep in my
[05:07.080 --> 05:11.920]  heart deep in my soul I've ever had in my 47 years on this planet I've had a lot of
[05:11.920 --> 05:22.960]  loss everybody else has and it's because it's a loss of ancestral freedom that so many people
[05:22.960 --> 05:31.920]  fought and died and bled and sweat for and now we're just thrown it all away and I see
[05:31.920 --> 05:36.880]  the general public in a medically induced scientifically induced behavioral psychologically
[05:36.880 --> 05:44.120]  controlled 20 and I know we're being fed into this globalist meat grinder and it's so incredibly
[05:44.120 --> 05:52.120]  sad but this is the process of birth and then growth and then falling apart and then degenerating
[05:52.120 --> 05:57.640]  collapsing and then coming back to life again it's just the globalist are actively trying
[05:57.640 --> 06:02.360]  to steer and control this process of decadence and collapse to actually end the species as
[06:02.360 --> 06:18.680]  we know it
[06:18.680 --> 06:35.640]  for worse the most banned network in the world where are the clowns send in the clown just
[06:35.640 --> 06:55.280]  when I stopped opening doors finally knowing the one that I wanted was your making my entrance
[06:55.280 --> 07:14.360]  again with my usual flair sure of my lines no one is there there's today's live show

[08:23.040 --> 08:30.920]  dashes any hopes the country will return to normal ever and let me give you the let me

[08:43.600 --> 08:48.160]  then that's a whole giant stack and i've got a bunch of actual government reports and and
[08:48.160 --> 08:54.840]  research surveys from around the world showing that the most sick people are those that have
[08:54.840 --> 08:59.560]  taken the vaccines in fact the highest death rate are of the quote vaccinated of quote
[08:59.560 --> 09:04.800]  covid like illnesses heart attacks strokes blood plots you name it so we've got all of
[09:04.800 --> 09:12.560]  that coming up then we've got the arizona audit that was very scientific and proved
[09:12.560 --> 09:18.640]  that trump won by more than five times what he needed to carry maricopa county there where
[09:18.640 --> 09:23.680]  phoenix is based that was only an audit of that county and that it clearly showed it
[09:23.680 --> 09:30.040]  and now we're learning it's far worse than what we were shown arizona audit final report
[09:30.040 --> 09:34.560]  was watered down reports from cyber ninjas were edited most damning statements removed
[09:34.560 --> 09:40.960]  what else was removed we're going to be looking at all of that today and how there's big recounts
[09:40.960 --> 09:45.520]  and other parts of the country like texas now beginning it's a very important process
[09:45.520 --> 09:50.240]  of exposing the fraud seeing and calls it the end of the country incredible danger they
[09:50.240 --> 09:55.600]  were the ones that promised not to accept the election until biden won they were the
[09:55.600 --> 10:00.800]  ones that said there's going to be a red mirage where it looks like trump has won and then
[10:00.800 --> 10:05.120]  quote he'll be gone one way or another even if the military asked removing quote from
[10:05.120 --> 10:13.960]  nancy pelosi and he said tucky schumer another said that again one way or another that trump
[10:13.960 --> 10:20.480]  would be removed so why are we not allowed to question especially when there's so much
[10:20.480 --> 10:27.280]  evidence of incredible fraud and now it's been proven the arizona audit completely delivered
[10:27.280 --> 10:34.720]  and that's why we witnessed on wednesday and thursday of last week ahead of them releasing
[10:34.720 --> 10:44.320]  their audit information you saw the headline biden won election audit of arizona found
[10:44.320 --> 10:53.000]  that was put on every channel on every news item out there and then when they released
[10:53.000 --> 10:58.480]  it on friday turns out the democrats had spies inside they'd seen the headline put out by
[10:58.480 --> 11:09.320]  the audit and it was biden won the election by fifty plus thousand fraudulent votes and
[11:09.320 --> 11:15.440]  if you remove those he lost by forty thousand plus votes that's how you state an investigation
[11:15.440 --> 11:20.800]  is if the fbi got some money indicted they'd say he had ten million dollars in his account
[11:20.800 --> 11:26.080]  and we have evidence that two million of it was stolen you don't say he's got eight million
[11:26.080 --> 11:29.680]  dollars in his account and two million stolen you say there's ten million and we're saying
[11:29.680 --> 11:36.320]  two million stolen it's the same thing they said okay biden won the election by cheating
[11:36.320 --> 11:41.320]  you know when a boxer wins and later you find out they tested positive for steroids
[11:41.320 --> 11:51.680]  right after you say he fraudulently won or if it turns out a racehorse was on amphetamines
[11:51.680 --> 11:55.440]  and they later do a test and you'll find out from the age of the drug and the blood for
[11:55.440 --> 11:58.640]  the metabolism of it that had been done a week before the race and so therefore they
[11:58.640 --> 12:05.760]  cheated they strip the crown but that's got to be done but you don't strip it till the
[12:05.760 --> 12:10.240]  commission that's over horse racing says it was clearly a fraud so so so the scientists
[12:10.240 --> 12:15.160]  test the blood and they say okay this is a week after the race this shows us that a week
[12:15.160 --> 12:19.320]  before the race you know the horse was given steroids and you know amphetamines and things
[12:19.320 --> 12:27.320]  and given more the day of the race after we tested them and so our findings are they cheated
[12:27.320 --> 12:32.680]  they won the race by cheating it's exactly what the arizona audit did it's not their
[12:32.680 --> 12:36.320]  job to come out and overturn the election and say biden doesn't get it now they came
[12:36.320 --> 12:43.480]  out and said he won the election with fifty plus thousand ballots that were fraudulent
[12:43.480 --> 12:47.600]  and that were duplicates and where people already voted and on and on and on and so the media
[12:47.600 --> 12:56.400]  spun that semantical point to deceive everyone and they do it over and over and over again
[12:56.400 --> 13:02.200]  so I'll get into that coming up and so this whole thing marches on that's good to expose
[13:02.200 --> 13:08.680]  the midterm elections coming up you know why were they covering up the windows so people
[13:08.680 --> 13:11.880]  couldn't see what they were doing because they pulled out briefcases and suitcases run
[13:11.880 --> 13:16.680]  to the tables with the same stacks of ballots in Georgia and Atlanta and ran it over and
[13:16.680 --> 13:21.320]  over and over and over again at first they said you can't be in there as a covid they
[13:21.320 --> 13:24.800]  said well you can't look through the windows because the water main broke but it wasn't
[13:24.800 --> 13:31.880]  true now did they want us focusing on the ballots and the fake ballots and on the millions
[13:31.880 --> 13:35.720]  of ballots around the country printed up they actually found in maricopa county thousands
[13:35.720 --> 13:41.520]  of thousands of ballots that were not ever issued by the state which means they were
[13:41.520 --> 13:46.640]  counterfeits now they don't want you focusing on how it's all about the machines the fraud
[13:46.640 --> 13:52.440]  it was done to the machines yeah fraudulent ballots fed into the machines they got to
[13:52.440 --> 13:57.120]  buy to focus on how the machines can be hacked and certainly some of that went on but the
[13:57.120 --> 14:01.840]  way they stole it and made sure that their tracks were very hard to catch was physical
[14:01.840 --> 14:08.520]  ballots because then you got to do a physical recount of everything and that's very hard
[14:08.520 --> 14:14.400]  but it's being done and now they are in full panic mode that's coming up CNN says trumps
[14:14.400 --> 14:19.040]  new interviews and appearances show that the storm is brewing our country will not survive
[14:19.040 --> 14:27.800]  this says CNN brian stelter our country won't survive this mean it won't survive the globalists
[14:27.800 --> 14:31.240]  getting rid of the borders bankrupting it destroying our military forcibly injecting
[14:31.240 --> 14:35.880]  people with poison shots the hospitals collapsing not from covid cases but from smart people
[14:35.880 --> 14:42.080]  resigning and leaving 600 Navy seals are about to be thrown out of the Navy because they
[14:42.080 --> 14:46.760]  won't take the shots yeah I thought they're smart and elite and know what they're doing
[14:46.760 --> 14:51.200]  and they are and they're saying they don't want it why is that brian because they know
[14:51.200 --> 14:54.760]  others that took the shots and had heart attacks and serious problems the better shape you're
[14:54.760 --> 15:01.600]  in the worst these injections are so that's all coming up we've got such a giant broadcast
[15:01.600 --> 15:07.200]  for you today but the first thing I'm going to hit when we come back is going down the
[15:07.200 --> 15:14.600]  rabbit hole I already walked in here this morning before I looked at all the giant stacks that
[15:14.600 --> 15:19.480]  my producers had printed for me and the big stacks that I'd sent to them to print for
[15:19.480 --> 15:26.120]  me I noticed a stack I hadn't asked for it was funny because I just asked the producer
[15:26.120 --> 15:31.280]  get me a bunch of articles where there's suddenly all of the news saying don't question believe
[15:31.280 --> 15:38.320]  lies be emotional noble lies are good and Scott goes oh I already thought of that it's a major
[15:38.320 --> 15:43.080]  trend in the news here it is and he gave me a stack of the news the so-called news the
[15:43.080 --> 15:47.400]  enemy of the people the enemy of truth the enemy of freedom saying it's time to lie it's
[15:47.400 --> 15:52.240]  time to cheat it's time to be emotional it's not time to look at facts don't read the fine
[15:52.240 --> 15:56.920]  print I mean would you buy a used car for someone that said don't read the fight fine print
[15:56.920 --> 16:02.680]  much less take a shot from somebody that wants you to do that if you're concerned about the

[19:31.040 --> 19:36.920]  great reset blueprint that australia the uk europe and the rest of western world is and
[19:36.920 --> 19:43.160]  that this is just the beginning more lockdowns national medical ids approved by the united
[19:43.160 --> 19:48.240]  nations carbon taxes that don't just track a trade should tax you but actually tell you
[19:48.240 --> 19:53.040]  when you could go somewhere and what you can do it's all been announced at the u n level
[19:53.040 --> 19:59.360]  this is a u n world government takeover corporate revolution through global governments it's
[19:59.360 --> 20:08.120]  illegal and congress must stand up and stop it now you're listening to the alex jones
[20:08.120 --> 20:30.280]  show
[20:30.280 --> 20:43.440]  it always takes our kindness for weakness and in the end it falls the question is how bad
[20:43.440 --> 20:49.960]  is this going to get before we wake up and say no so let's let's hit this first before
[20:49.960 --> 20:56.240]  I plow into all of this just earth shaking information and let's just look at this group
[20:56.240 --> 21:02.920]  of articles that is a small sampling that has just come out in the last few days here's
[21:02.920 --> 21:10.120]  a headline don't go down the rabbit hole new york times says do not engage in critical
[21:10.120 --> 21:16.960]  thinking this is just one of dozens of articles they put out the same type of message here's
[21:16.960 --> 21:24.200]  seeing in last week these four words are helping spread vaccine misinformation do your own
[21:24.200 --> 21:33.760]  research they're saying let us think for you wear a mask over your face you're non-essentials
[21:33.760 --> 21:38.120]  stay six feet apart from each other take these experimental shots oh they totally protect
[21:38.120 --> 21:42.120]  you but they don't you'll be safe when you're shot but people that don't take the shot are
[21:42.120 --> 21:46.800]  going to make you sick this is all cult programming here's another one it's time to give up on
[21:46.800 --> 21:54.280]  facts says slate jess Zimmerman or at least to temporarily lay them down in favor of a
[21:54.280 --> 22:04.440]  more useful weapon emotions defeat the right wingers make them all take the shots that
[22:04.440 --> 22:08.760]  was years ago they were saying that you see that's how you defeat trump is you lay aside
[22:08.760 --> 22:14.120]  facts you start lying there's so many articles back in 2017 will defeat trump by lying so
[22:14.120 --> 22:20.640]  there's an older article give me an example you must not do your own research when it
[22:20.640 --> 22:30.080]  comes to science forbs and it goes on to say don't look at fluoride research it's good
[22:30.080 --> 22:40.040]  for you calcium fluoride's part of what you need oh really is hydrofluorosalic is hydrofluorosalic
[22:40.040 --> 22:45.400]  is it good because it's an acid based fluoride that's deadly poison and is an adjuvant to
[22:45.400 --> 22:49.840]  accelerate the effect of toxins on the body and is not linked it directly causes infertility
[22:49.840 --> 22:56.000]  and cancer oh here's another article this is one al cross this is out of the northern
[22:56.000 --> 23:00.640]  Kentucky Tribune questioning authority has become too much of a good thing and it's killing
[23:00.640 --> 23:06.960]  people this is a new article out this weekend al cross is a professor of the university
[23:06.960 --> 23:11.440]  of Kentucky school of journalism and media director of the institute for rural journalism
[23:11.440 --> 23:21.520]  and community issues and he's coming in to tell us we need to take our shots and we
[23:21.520 --> 23:29.280]  need to do what they say and that we need to not question anything don't question the
[23:29.280 --> 23:33.600]  media don't question elections don't question anything I mean this is sick you know why
[23:33.600 --> 23:40.720]  because what they're feeding us is a lie may or kiss the border is secure also 12,000 Haitian
[23:40.720 --> 23:45.280]  illegal immigrants were just released in the US now they're building a permanent center
[23:45.280 --> 23:52.000]  at that bridge just you get here you're legal so that means they released 60% of those and
[23:52.000 --> 23:55.080]  it's probably a higher number number two weeks ago I said folks when they say they're shipping
[23:55.080 --> 24:02.160]  them back to Haiti that's not true and the same guy has been on the news saying that
[24:02.160 --> 24:06.440]  the border patrol was whipping people with bullwebs and he said on CNN I'll play it in
[24:06.440 --> 24:11.680]  a moment over the weekend he said well even if they didn't whip anybody was just the reins
[24:11.680 --> 24:14.880]  of them whipping the horse which they're investigating as well you're not supposed to whip a horse
[24:14.880 --> 24:17.720]  unless what you do with the reins because they've got really thick hives that's what
[24:17.720 --> 24:25.120]  spurs are for that's a big animal you're controlling they said even if they didn't it's what people
[24:25.120 --> 24:31.040]  saw so we've got to decry what people thought see that's mind control reality doesn't matter
[24:31.040 --> 24:35.720]  our lives matter and CNN's already run this live for a week so now their own Jake Tapper
[24:35.720 --> 24:40.640]  back tracks it says oh this is preposterous the border patrol did nothing so you know they
[24:40.640 --> 24:45.800]  run with a big story that act like they didn't push it it's not really a retraction it's
[24:45.800 --> 24:50.720]  a double think that's why they don't want you going down the rabbit hole or asking questions
[24:50.720 --> 24:55.600]  or looking at facts here's another one trans rights clash in Britain conservatives in labor
[24:55.600 --> 24:59.920]  can't decide who has a cervix they've had a bunch of cases now by trans actors where
[24:59.920 --> 25:05.240]  they demand that mammograms be done by female nurses of their penises and when the women
[25:05.240 --> 25:09.800]  nurses particularly say I'm not going to do a mammogram you don't have a vagina or cervix
[25:09.800 --> 25:15.520]  they are fired see that's mind control that's don't go down the rabbit hole there's another
[25:15.520 --> 25:18.840]  one I told you that was fake last week on the view but they go oh my god we just tested
[25:18.840 --> 25:23.560]  positive grab them get them out of here that's to show you hysteria and fear like China drag
[25:23.560 --> 25:26.960]  people off and turns out it's all fake they were right back the next day it was all fake
[25:26.960 --> 25:32.480]  animavaro busted testing negative right after supposedly testing positive live on TV for
[25:32.480 --> 25:38.280]  the Kamala interview it's all just teaching you to be tested living in a technocracy here's
[25:38.280 --> 25:42.560]  another one member I questioned Jesse small it with a new surround his neck bleach poured
[25:42.560 --> 25:49.920]  on him with 20 below zero in Chicago at three o'clock in the morning and it was all fake
[25:49.920 --> 25:59.880]  and 95% or more of hate crimes are fake and here it is surprise another hate hoax black
[25:59.880 --> 26:06.320]  Emory University employee arrested for vandalizing autism center with racist anti-semitic graffiti
[26:06.320 --> 26:12.080]  so he could be the hero and expose the Nazis that are everywhere and it happens everywhere
[26:12.080 --> 26:16.840]  all the time thousands of cases here's what else they don't want you looking at with critical
[26:16.840 --> 26:23.040]  thinking this is right out of the UN zone numbers in Israel Israel highest inoculation
[26:23.040 --> 26:28.720]  rate highest death rate highest infection rate highest hospitalization rate and then I've
[26:28.720 --> 26:34.040]  got this shocking numbers this is directly out of the CDC death rates among fully vaccinated
[26:34.040 --> 26:40.600]  Americans who contracted COVID-19 is alarmingly high it's twice as high as those hospitalized
[26:40.600 --> 26:45.200]  who are not vaccinated hospitalized or fatal COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough cases report
[26:45.200 --> 26:52.440]  the CDC as of September 20th 2021 here's the blow up of the number if you go to the hospital
[26:52.440 --> 26:58.920]  after you've been inoculated it is a 23.5% chance you're going to die that's twice as
[26:58.920 --> 27:02.160]  high as somebody going to the hospital who was not inoculated you can look it up but
[27:02.160 --> 27:06.880]  it gets worse they don't count people that die within 14 days the inoculation so many
[27:06.880 --> 27:11.600]  estimates are it cuts about half of that out so the numbers much much higher oh that's
[27:11.600 --> 27:18.680]  why they don't want you going down a rabbit hole right oh let's keep going down rabbit
[27:18.680 --> 27:23.000]  holes here there's actual article COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough cases investigated and
[27:23.000 --> 27:27.720]  reporting numbers I just showed you from the CDC but again don't go down that rabbit hole
[27:27.720 --> 27:33.520]  these articles say you're not a scientist you can't read them oh really I I can't read
[27:33.520 --> 27:36.760]  it I mean I guess I don't have a business degree so I can't run my own operation or
[27:36.760 --> 27:42.040]  I guess I don't have a degree in finger painting either I can go home and paint if I want or
[27:42.040 --> 27:45.680]  there's a lot of people Bill Gates doesn't have a degree but he runs his own companies
[27:45.680 --> 27:50.480]  I mean this idea that you can't look at it they told us the vaccine was 95% effective
[27:50.480 --> 27:56.400]  now it's 39 their own scientists said don't give booster shots they don't do anything except
[27:56.400 --> 28:00.760]  make you sick and they overrode that they go that's the science that's the science is
[28:00.760 --> 28:06.880]  corporate CEOs now run your body in your life not even government bureaucrats and then here's
[28:06.880 --> 28:13.160]  another example going on the rabbit hole they've got this article circulating force fed everywhere
[28:13.160 --> 28:18.480]  biden's vaccine mandate for workers is supported by legal precedence experts say when you go
[28:18.480 --> 28:24.040]  read the legal precedence it's from a hundred years ago and 115 years ago supreme court
[28:24.040 --> 28:29.480]  rulings that they could forcibly inject and forcibly sterilize or whites and black people
[28:29.480 --> 28:36.480]  and I just so happen to get the new york times article about it from 1897 for you so we'll
[28:36.480 --> 28:41.000]  give you that information it's so important as well and also play that jiktapper thing
[28:41.000 --> 28:44.800]  going oh it was all a lie about the border patrol that matter the left still has their
[28:44.800 --> 28:50.240]  emotion switch off brain switch off facts and use emotion as a weapon against your enemy
[28:50.240 --> 28:54.120]  your fellow country folks that want to keep the country going want to keep the pipelines
[28:54.120 --> 28:58.400]  going want to not ever children taught by pedophiles wait till I hit this other news
[28:58.400 --> 29:03.720]  too it's a big news on the terrorism front hey everybody confused about staying healthy

[29:08.800 --> 29:13.760]  studies after all the squabbling there's one thing almost everyone agrees on it's that
[29:13.760 --> 29:18.440]  immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death you probably
[29:18.440 --> 29:23.240]  already believe that I certainly do so here's the thing I wanted to get past the craziness
[29:23.240 --> 29:28.520]  and find out which plant based substances actually have studies that demonstrate some
[29:28.520 --> 29:33.160]  efficacy in immune support now you'll have to sign a waiver but you can check out what

[30:28.280 --> 30:32.120]  from using nuclear weapons when Trump was going for Daytona with China and North Korea
[30:32.120 --> 30:36.240]  at the time and Trump's responded saying it's a total lie Pelosi's come out and admitted
[30:36.240 --> 30:41.440]  it happened hell she bragged back on January 8 that it took place then and is saying that
[30:41.440 --> 30:45.680]  she honors milley and that he's this courageous person so we're all these other democrats
[30:45.680 --> 30:50.000]  so this is the permanent deep state coup that's been in control for a long time now coming

[32:14.640 --> 32:20.440]  big problem consuming too much fluoride forms phosphate crystals around the pineal gland
[32:20.440 --> 32:26.000]  and shuts down its natural functions natural functions which have been known for millennia
[32:26.000 --> 32:30.240]  the hindu chakras align with the endocrine system the chakra aligned with the pineal
[32:30.240 --> 32:36.280]  gland is the third eye also described as the seat of the soul the pineal gland is what

[33:24.320 --> 33:37.520]  from the info wars dot com studios you're listening to the alex jones show
[33:37.520 --> 34:02.720]  you got me now
[34:07.600 --> 34:13.600]  thank you so much for joining us on this live worldwide transmission september 27 2021
[34:13.600 --> 34:18.640]  on this monday okay let's just plunge right back into all of it here because there's so
[34:18.640 --> 34:23.840]  much to hit i'm gonna cover every one of these stacks we got some really bad news coming up
[34:23.840 --> 34:27.280]  the end of this segment but we knew it was coming so that's the good news we know how to deal with
[34:27.280 --> 34:31.440]  it they're following an exact plan should be easy to beat once people figure out how much trouble
[34:31.440 --> 34:36.480]  they're in but if people are delusional they can kiss their asses goodbye and their children
[34:36.480 --> 34:42.160]  goodbye as well here's some good news speaking of children facebook scraps instagram kids
[34:43.840 --> 34:49.520]  as backlash intensifies a system for them to prey on your children make them depressed
[34:49.520 --> 34:56.160]  manipulate you isolate them with peer pressure using behavioral psychology weapons this is in
[34:56.160 --> 35:03.120]  their own admissions and then give predators access to your children now remember shon parker who
[35:03.120 --> 35:10.880]  worked at facebook at the highest levels with mark zuckerberg came out five years ago and he said
[35:12.080 --> 35:16.160]  look when i was there it was weaponized and we wanted to make people alone we wanted to control
[35:16.160 --> 35:20.400]  them and we wanted to have avatars that were fake friends that were then lead groups of people
[35:21.040 --> 35:26.240]  into the types of worldviews and and things we wanted and he said and that was when i was there
[35:26.240 --> 35:35.760]  it's far more advanced now so it's it's designed to mimic addiction to painkillers it's designed to
[35:35.760 --> 35:40.720]  manipulate dopamine in your brain and then it basically you only have so many decisions in
[35:40.720 --> 35:46.160]  your mind every day in the conscious mind and so after so many little mindless decisions
[35:46.160 --> 35:50.400]  you're burned out you can't make good decisions anymore but you're still there clicking and
[35:50.400 --> 35:55.440]  going places and doing things and they're able to basically take control of your life it is a face
[35:55.440 --> 36:00.320]  sucking system that's why now you know i see beautiful stuff when i go for hikes i leave the
[36:00.320 --> 36:04.720]  damn phone i turn off put it in the drawer and i have a much better day except when i use it for
[36:04.720 --> 36:11.280]  work you have to know what it is it's a radioactive device culturally spiritually and quite literally
[36:11.280 --> 36:18.960]  it radiates microwave radiation so it is radioactive in the literal and in the
[36:18.960 --> 36:32.080]  system in that it is culturally radioactive and destructive there it is former facebook
[36:32.080 --> 36:39.040]  executive social media is ripping society apart and now if you want to be on facebook and trying
[36:39.040 --> 36:43.920]  to create these communal dorms where nothing you have is private and and and with apple all of
[36:43.920 --> 36:47.600]  everything you do is on the iCloud and they told apple employees a few months ago oh everything
[36:47.600 --> 36:53.040]  you do on the iCloud including your private phone calls your private messages your private photos
[36:53.040 --> 36:58.400]  are going to be looked at by executives but apple employees were like well you can do that to the
[36:58.400 --> 37:05.200]  general public but not us we're part of the elite and of course four years ago china was given all
[37:05.200 --> 37:12.400]  access to all codes to all iPhones and apple products on the world and that was in Reuters
[37:12.400 --> 37:17.040]  and they said of course we give the chinese government access to all of the code keys to all apple
[37:17.040 --> 37:23.360]  devices worldwide they said quote that's what you do when you're in china so they'll do this stuff
[37:23.360 --> 37:27.520]  with the San Bernardino Christmas shooting where they're like oh we won't give the fbi the code to
[37:27.520 --> 37:33.280]  get in a phone that's all kabuki theater like when apple has billboards everywhere saying apple
[37:33.280 --> 37:42.240]  equals privacy that's the billboard apple equals privacy you mean apple equals delete privacy apple
[37:42.240 --> 37:49.520]  apple equals clear privacy get rid of privacy because it certainly doesn't protect it so facebook
[37:49.520 --> 37:56.240]  scraps instagram kids as backlash intensifies after being asked by a cadre of 40 state attorney
[37:56.240 --> 38:01.920]  generals to abandon the project on the grounds that would be bad for psychological development
[38:01.920 --> 38:07.120]  and also create a predator's paradise facebook instagram announced monday in a blog post that
[38:07.120 --> 38:12.560]  it was finally abandoning the ill-fated instagram kids service which was supposed to create a
[38:12.560 --> 38:17.680]  parallel version of the service for children under the age of 13 but they're already already
[38:17.680 --> 38:22.240]  all on there and they're already being hurt by it and you got to intervene with your children and
[38:22.240 --> 38:28.000]  take it away i know it starts when they're three years old and you're at the mexican food restaurant
[38:28.000 --> 38:32.080]  of the steakhouse and you took the little one and if you just let them watch blues clues they'll leave
[38:32.080 --> 38:35.840]  you alone remember you need dinner with your wife should just get a babysitter and not let them put
[38:35.840 --> 38:40.160]  the child in front of that if you don't want the child there take them over to mama's house or daddy's
[38:40.160 --> 38:45.120]  house or daycare and take them to a daycare that doesn't put them in front of a tv it destroys
[38:45.120 --> 38:50.960]  their minds it rewires them it lowers their IQ you might as well beat them with a baseball bat
[38:54.480 --> 39:00.160]  i don't mean that literally but it's it's the same effect so that's where we are and that is a
[39:00.160 --> 39:06.960]  big victory but these are purely predatory systems set up to stun and control and dumb america down
[39:06.960 --> 39:13.440]  so when you see leftists on facebook twitter youtube bullying nationalist bullying patriots
[39:13.440 --> 39:19.360]  bullying christians bullying uh families remember these are the minions that have succumb to the
[39:19.360 --> 39:26.480]  gaslighting and who fell to the zombie horde so don't hate them forgive them and lovingly try to
[39:26.480 --> 39:30.880]  help them if you can if not move on and i'm speaking to myself when i say this because they
[39:30.880 --> 39:35.200]  discussed me and i can't stand them as well but remember they are at the end of the day victims
[39:35.200 --> 39:39.600]  they wanted to be victims and they are victims now victims of the system they serve and all
[39:39.600 --> 39:45.680]  statistics show it many many more times we're more likely to be depressed or commit suicide or to be
[39:45.680 --> 39:54.480]  mentally ill or to steal or to lie or to virtue signal they are the conformists they completely
[39:54.480 --> 39:59.200]  bought into it doesn't mean that all of us don't have our own problems it's just that we are conscious
[39:59.200 --> 40:05.680]  of that fact and trying to be better trying to live in that virtual world
[40:06.560 --> 40:10.880]  people 20 years ago used to make fun of those simulation video games where people would you
[40:10.880 --> 40:16.320]  know pay for a real ferrari that wasn't real in cyberspace or pay for a mansion
[40:18.160 --> 40:23.600]  so they could be cool in the simulated world well now that's what this is and and and you
[40:23.600 --> 40:27.120]  say well why would they do that because there's always going to be predators that know that
[40:27.120 --> 40:31.360]  we have weaknesses who want to get ahead and so they'll do corrupt bad things they'll launch
[40:31.360 --> 40:35.680]  wars they'll release bio weapons they'll pose as your saver they'll propagandize they'll target
[40:35.680 --> 40:40.640]  your children they'll do anything because it's their nature their psychopaths and sociopaths
[40:42.080 --> 40:48.800]  and then they breed a bunch of followers that are gremlin like and try to emulate the psychopaths
[40:48.800 --> 40:54.880]  and sociopaths above them but have low IQs so it creates the blue and green and purple hair phenomenon
[40:55.600 --> 41:02.080]  that we see everywhere now and i'm not shocked by their blue or purple hair my point is is that
[41:02.080 --> 41:07.120]  is that they don't have any real independence in them or any original thought so they adopt all of
[41:07.120 --> 41:13.360]  the festooned symbols of what they see as being independent when actually it's the symbol of their
[41:13.360 --> 41:20.000]  slavery and i don't mean you should then drive a tahoe and have short hair and and and wear you
[41:20.000 --> 41:24.960]  know navy blue sports jackets all day and play golf that's other people conforming to their own
[41:24.960 --> 41:29.040]  system if you love golf because you love it great if you love blue hair because you love it great
[41:29.040 --> 41:34.080]  but is it your identity there's something beyond blue hair something beyond golf something beyond
[41:34.080 --> 41:37.840]  just going to church is your church speaking out against world government is your church speaking
[41:37.840 --> 41:43.840]  out against partial birth abortion is your church speaking out against the global id and the answer
[41:43.840 --> 41:49.600]  is no because it's not a church it's another conformist system of the world which is run by
[41:49.600 --> 41:54.400]  the very worst people historically because we let them run it and that is the human process that
[41:54.400 --> 42:00.800]  happens over and over and over again in that cycle all right i didn't get to the border stuff yet i
[42:00.800 --> 42:09.440]  want to play this amazing interaction between the head of dhs and tapper i'm explaining what's
[42:09.440 --> 42:15.040]  really going on there in my view and then biden is saying oh quote those people will pay that
[42:15.040 --> 42:20.240]  bullwhip the black people of course didn't happen doesn't matter because the head of dhs says it's
[42:20.240 --> 42:26.880]  a perception that's horrible and will be investigated that perception will be punished but yeah we
[42:26.880 --> 42:30.720]  know they're innocent but we can't say they're innocent we're just going to let this fade away
[42:30.720 --> 42:37.680]  this is mind control this is reception over reality by the way you've only got a week and a half left
[42:37.680 --> 42:42.960]  or less you got nine days left to get a free copy of in game my seminal film so you have your archives
[42:42.960 --> 42:48.160]  you can share it and spread it for free at cobinland.com with your purchase of the new film that

[42:55.520 --> 43:03.840]  of in game at cobinland.com we'll be right back we've all heard about the pastor and his famous
[43:03.840 --> 43:09.440]  statement from inside a concentration camp in world war two that when they came for one group he
[43:09.440 --> 43:13.360]  wasn't part of that group so he didn't stand up and then when they came for another group he wasn't
[43:13.360 --> 43:18.400]  part of that group so he didn't stand up and finally when they came for him there was nobody
[43:18.400 --> 43:22.560]  else to stand up oh the global social credit score that china is putting in that's banning people
[43:22.560 --> 43:26.960]  to three hours of video games a week and if you criticize the government you can never buy or sell
[43:26.960 --> 43:31.520]  again well that's that's being brought here and all over the world under the guise of covid
[43:32.160 --> 43:36.880]  vaccine passports they even admit it now there's going to be a carbon tax attached to it they're
[43:36.880 --> 43:41.360]  going to track where you go and what you do and decide where you can go and what you can do that's
[43:41.360 --> 43:47.280]  what the lockdowns are about you'll accept that you'll accept anything so again the left is having
[43:47.280 --> 43:51.520]  fun right now with all the censorship and tyranny pretending like they're part of the power structure
[43:51.520 --> 43:55.120]  but they're all going to be targeted by this nightmare as well we need to get back to basic
[43:55.120 --> 43:59.680]  human rights and promote them or all of us will be enslaved by this horrible technocracy run by the
[43:59.680 --> 44:07.840]  globalists so the placebo that they have used that the fda has allowed them to use has often been
[44:07.840 --> 44:13.680]  another vaccine a vaccine with a known adverse reaction profile that's causing death and damage
[44:13.680 --> 44:21.760]  in its own right that it's the aluminum as an adjuvant in the vaccine a known neurotoxin a
[44:21.760 --> 44:28.560]  known immunotoxin a known poison in human beings that is in the supposedly inert placebo totally
[44:28.560 --> 44:35.760]  inappropriate this is not good science it is not science at all it is an effort to cover up
[44:35.760 --> 44:42.080]  the true adverse reaction rates to these vaccines so that they can get through the low barrier
[44:42.080 --> 44:48.160]  of constraints put there by the fda and onto the market that is the only concern doctor wakefield is

[46:06.000 --> 46:10.880]  welcome. Would like to say first off thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this
[46:10.880 --> 46:15.520]  stupidity wanted to warn people i've been trying to get a hold of you for a year okay i'm a double
[46:15.520 --> 46:22.800]  amputee and i have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away uh living defense saved my
[46:22.800 --> 46:28.960]  life they had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me living defense brought me back
[46:28.960 --> 46:35.360]  i wanted to just quote from the bible jesus is saying as to where we are right now this is Matthew
[46:35.360 --> 46:43.600]  24 verse 9 then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated
[46:43.600 --> 46:50.080]  of all nations for my name sake and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another
[46:50.080 --> 46:55.280]  and shall hate one another that's right where we're at brother and that's because god's name
[46:55.280 --> 46:59.520]  is on the founding of this country no matter what they say and that's why the enemy hates it because
[46:59.520 --> 47:11.200]  god created this country you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:11.200 --> 47:30.240]  free world news dot tv that's the url that they're not blocking the tension
[47:30.240 --> 47:34.800]  demand on video to share it on twitter facebook youtube everywhere free world news dot tv free
[47:34.800 --> 47:39.360]  world news dot tv that's where the free world is fighting back against globalist tyranny
[47:39.360 --> 47:46.240]  all right we've got a lot of news and a lot of information to cover in the next hour
[47:49.280 --> 47:52.960]  on seven different big subjects that i'll tell you about at that time but believe me you don't
[47:52.960 --> 47:58.960]  want to miss this information here's just one of them and we have the audio of this put out by the
[47:58.960 --> 48:06.560]  new yorker magazine calling for blowing up gas pipelines around the us and putting a book out
[48:06.560 --> 48:12.480]  explaining how to blow things up and kill people this is on info wars dot com literally platforming
[48:12.480 --> 48:19.040]  a terrorist the new yorker takes heat for hosting climate activists arguing for blowing up pipelines
[48:19.840 --> 48:24.400]  now folks i've been subpoenaed by the fbi i've been investigated for eight months
[48:26.080 --> 48:29.680]  they've interviewed people and tried to get them to say that i commanded them to attack the capital
[48:29.680 --> 48:35.280]  they're trying to put me in jail right now we're trying to stop the attack by their provocateurs
[48:35.280 --> 48:42.480]  of the capital if i got up on air and said blow up pipelines and then put a book out on how to do it
[48:42.480 --> 48:48.400]  i would be arrested and i should be arrested i mean if you're teaching people how to blow up
[48:48.400 --> 48:51.280]  pipelines and telling them to do it you need to be in a super max prison
[48:55.440 --> 48:59.760]  and by the way most the fbi agrees with me they're not bad people the rank and fall that's really
[48:59.760 --> 49:03.520]  true some of the most awake people in my experience but it doesn't matter the just department lawyers
[49:03.520 --> 49:08.960]  are all a bunch of criminal scum at the top now i mean it's like 90 bad people and so wait till i
[49:08.960 --> 49:17.520]  hit that speaking of scum mayorkas the border is secured also 12 000 Haitian illegal immigrants
[49:17.520 --> 49:27.440]  were just released into the us and that was this weekend now they're now saying it's oh 16 000 in
[49:27.440 --> 49:31.120]  the us and more are coming because they know biden's gonna let them in which we told you
[49:31.120 --> 49:36.960]  and they mean oh no they're all getting sent back that's the gas lining but what's the big story
[49:36.960 --> 49:42.480]  been not the kidnap kids not the rapes not the deaths not how the worldwide lockdown made Haiti
[49:42.480 --> 49:46.000]  and other countries collapse so they're all flooding out now to come here not how the very
[49:46.000 --> 49:50.800]  same un did that that now organizes them no none of that nothing about replacement migration
[49:53.840 --> 49:56.960]  we have the so-called president who everybody knows stole the election
[49:56.960 --> 50:08.240]  and Joe Biden saying those people will pay those people will pay who are told
[50:10.240 --> 50:16.560]  when you've got tens of thousands of people now it's over 30 000 came across multiple sites all
[50:16.560 --> 50:20.240]  them down the border they're just they're just being let go now now it's no longer a spectacle
[50:20.240 --> 50:26.640]  nobody cares two weeks later the people that run from the border patrol are being stopped
[50:26.640 --> 50:30.240]  because they have big satchels and the board patrol is asking why aren't they turning themselves
[50:30.240 --> 50:34.960]  in we just let them in we're gonna chase them and we're gonna whip the horses so they go into the
[50:34.960 --> 50:39.840]  water because horses don't like to chase men chase people so horses are scared of a piece of
[50:39.840 --> 50:45.840]  trash blown along the ground horses are scared of dogs these horses aren't wanting to run up on
[50:45.840 --> 50:51.200]  these people so they're having to whip them with the reins which try to make a horse go up a hill
[50:51.200 --> 50:57.840]  you got to kick them with your spurs and hit them with the reins that becomes Django the white man
[50:57.840 --> 51:02.800]  is chasing down Django and all the rest of this crap while the Haitians are battling to get into
[51:02.800 --> 51:10.560]  the evil country set up by white people I mean it's just it's just crazy and and America's had
[51:10.560 --> 51:15.840]  its problems but compared to others it's been the best so this is globalist conquering us this is
[51:15.840 --> 51:22.160]  what's going on and you've got this criminal biding up there but but listen to what the head of DHS
[51:22.160 --> 51:27.920]  says on Fox News Sunday he says yeah okay I'm not gonna say they're innocent even though now
[51:29.760 --> 51:33.760]  the people that took the photos are saying that and and everyone admits it's not true
[51:33.760 --> 51:39.600]  because it's emotional and I have to decry what people thought and just worship this evil white
[51:39.600 --> 51:44.880]  person whipping a black person with a bullwhip I've you know it's like Jesse Smallett or it's
[51:44.880 --> 51:50.560]  like Bubba Wallace oh look there's nooses on the garage because people tied a rope on it to pull it down
[51:54.240 --> 51:58.160]  this is who the left is that they're gaslighting frauds here's the clip
[52:00.400 --> 52:06.240]  I promise you those people will pay they will be an investigation underway now and there will be
[52:06.240 --> 52:13.760]  consequences there will be consequences I will not prejudge the facts I do not in any way want to
[52:13.760 --> 52:20.800]  impair the integrity of the investigative process but Mr. Secretary you also said that the images
[52:20.800 --> 52:26.480]  quote horrified us how can DHS claim to have an independent investigation into these border patrol
[52:26.480 --> 52:31.840]  agents when the president says quote those people will pay and you say the images horrified us
[52:33.040 --> 52:41.840]  Jake I think it's quite clear that what the images suggest horrified the American public
[52:41.840 --> 52:49.760]  that is quite different than learning what actually happened determining the facts
[52:49.760 --> 52:56.240]  and the fact determinations will be made in an independent investigation by the office for
[52:56.240 --> 53:02.240]  professional responsibility and the facts that are reduced the facts that are determined
[53:03.040 --> 53:09.680]  will drive the outcome nothing less and nothing more some of the initial images
[53:09.680 --> 53:17.200]  but what those images what those images suggest what they appeared to portray
[53:18.080 --> 53:25.280]  was horrifying and that I think deserves attention that is quite different than fact
[53:25.280 --> 53:32.080]  determinations and I will tell you I served as a federal prosecutor for 12 years and we conducted
[53:32.080 --> 53:39.680]  independent investigations despite what appearances might have been and the public outcry about them
[53:39.680 --> 53:45.200]  but that but that's the thing some of the initial descriptions of those images were just patently
[53:45.200 --> 53:52.800]  false there's now video out there that provides more context having seen the video are you certain
[53:52.800 --> 53:59.440]  that there was actually wrongdoing I am going to let those investigators make that determination
[53:59.440 --> 54:07.120]  and then that determination will drive the outcome of the investigation can the border patrol count on
[54:07.120 --> 54:14.240]  you and president Biden who has said the people will pay to come to a determination based on the
[54:14.240 --> 54:22.160]  facts and and not based on twitter outrage they sure can and let me say something about that
[54:22.160 --> 54:26.640]  Jake because I worked very close I don't want to hear any more of this shut it down and of course
[54:26.640 --> 54:31.200]  he came out days before and said it's horrible we're going to punish the people and and Biden said
[54:31.200 --> 54:35.200]  oh they will pay they're guilty we're going to have an investigation and the investigation's
[54:35.200 --> 54:39.120]  going to find them guilty that's what Biden basically said because it's there's nothing
[54:39.120 --> 54:44.080]  worse in the world than a white person in a fight with a black person that mean white people are bad
[54:44.080 --> 54:48.800]  black people are good and the government and the mega corporations that run slave camps in China
[54:48.800 --> 54:53.440]  they're going to save brown people in America from the dreaded white people because you know
[54:53.440 --> 54:58.000]  when you're you know at the shopping mall and you see white people you know they're the bad ones or
[54:58.000 --> 55:02.320]  your church you see them you know the bad ones folks this is all very simple this is divide and
[55:02.320 --> 55:07.680]  conquer and this is the globalist saying all of you are suspect you got to wear a mask over your
[55:07.680 --> 55:11.920]  face because you're dirty and have viruses all humans are bad and the emergency is never going
[55:11.920 --> 55:16.000]  to end you got to take shots every few months or everybody's going to die you can't live without
[55:16.000 --> 55:20.640]  these shots those are statements i'm going to read next hour by the head of australian health system
[55:20.640 --> 55:27.120]  and the head of fizer and now falchi saying gotta have the shots all the time to be safe all of it's
[55:27.120 --> 55:34.720]  a lie there is no natural immunity all of that's a lie we're overriding all the scientists that's
[55:34.720 --> 55:41.680]  the science they're lying to you and we all know that but we the listeners of the show the the
[55:41.680 --> 55:46.240]  guests of the show the crew of the show this family has to come together as we've done already and
[55:46.240 --> 55:51.440]  have get others to come together to see the divide and conquer strategy of the globalists that are
[55:51.440 --> 55:58.240]  taking us over taking our freedoms and destroying our futures it is it is so incredibly simple
[55:59.760 --> 56:06.320]  what is happening and what is unfolding and so oh we're all dirty we we've all got covid we're
[56:06.320 --> 56:10.080]  all got to be suspect but the government the corporations will watch us and track us and
[56:10.080 --> 56:14.320]  test us and and make us not essential and lock us on our houses and make us all prisoners
[56:14.320 --> 56:18.880]  and oh my gosh the white people are bad they're gonna get you and so we can we can discriminate
[56:18.880 --> 56:22.400]  against them and charge them more for things and you know because they deserve it because they're
[56:22.400 --> 56:27.760]  white they're introducing the idea of persecution of minorities which is always bad i was against it
[56:27.760 --> 56:32.080]  when brown people were the minority now i'm against it when white people the minority and we knew
[56:32.080 --> 56:35.600]  that's where this was all going they don't want to bring in all these foreigners to make them part
[56:35.600 --> 56:39.600]  of the melting pot they want to bring them in to turn them all against each other like in a prison
[56:39.600 --> 56:45.200]  you have the warden and his staff and you've got the hispanics the blacks and the whites all kept
[56:45.200 --> 56:49.040]  in racial groups if you don't want to be in a racial group they make you get in one or the
[56:49.040 --> 56:53.200]  warden basically puts you in solitary confinement you pledge allegiance to the hispanic supremacist
[56:53.200 --> 56:58.080]  the black supremacist or the white supremacist period and that's how they control a prison
[56:58.080 --> 57:02.240]  with the prisoners with the great game divide and conquer i'm gonna go to break that was a jam

[1:00:24.640 --> 1:00:28.880]  ground and now phaser admits that's coming to america i've been interviewing a lot of the
[1:00:28.880 --> 1:00:34.400]  people in the resistance in australia we're all ossees now stand with australia or suffer
[1:00:34.400 --> 1:00:38.160]  here's john bound's latest report at bandot video please get it and share it
[1:00:39.600 --> 1:00:46.640]  australia has become ground zero for the great reset tyranny the free people of australia are
[1:00:46.640 --> 1:00:52.720]  under total assault by power mad tyrants hell bent on returning the heart of oceania into a third
[1:00:52.720 --> 1:00:59.040]  world prison by spreading the great covet lie through its federations i now give the floor
[1:00:59.680 --> 1:01:05.520]  to the distinguished representative of australia to introduce an address by the head of government
[1:01:05.520 --> 1:01:11.120]  high vaccination rates are the pathway to taking back so much of what we have lost
[1:01:11.120 --> 1:01:17.840]  none of us is safe unless all of us are safe so this is the most urgent priority australian
[1:01:17.840 --> 1:01:23.840]  politicians within the bubble of its constitutional monarchy have over the years revealed that
[1:01:23.840 --> 1:01:29.200]  they are not exempt from the criminal perversions of the global elite extraordinary claims coming
[1:01:29.200 --> 1:01:35.120]  out of canberra tonight with a former prime minister allegedly on a list of suspected pedophiles
[1:01:35.120 --> 1:01:39.920]  liberal senator bill heffernan who is pushing for the child abuse royal commission to include the
[1:01:39.920 --> 1:01:47.360]  legal profession told an explosive senate hearing he has a police list of 28 prominent suspects there
[1:01:47.360 --> 1:01:54.960]  is a former prime minister on this list and it is a police document throughout my childhood
[1:01:54.960 --> 1:02:00.720]  i was a victim of australia's vip child sex trafficking ring for example i was prostituted
[1:02:00.720 --> 1:02:05.920]  to pedophile parties at parliament house canberra and to an international leader at fairbane
[1:02:05.920 --> 1:02:11.840]  military airport the people involved in this elite pedophile ring included high-ranking
[1:02:11.840 --> 1:02:20.000]  politicians police and judiciary and so it is the message of the elite that is dominating australia
[1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:26.240]  we believe in a world order that favors freedom and that supports the dignity and free expression
[1:02:26.240 --> 1:02:32.240]  of all people we believe in human rights in gender equality and the rule of law and we back that up
[1:02:32.240 --> 1:02:38.240]  with how we pursue these things in our own country in our own society and how we raise our own
[1:02:38.240 --> 1:02:44.160]  children australia was one of eight countries only involved in the drafting of the universal
[1:02:44.160 --> 1:02:49.600]  declaration of human rights and we continue to strengthen the international human rights system
[1:02:49.600 --> 1:02:55.600]  and we will continue to raise our voice on important issues like the rights of women and girls the
[1:02:55.600 --> 1:03:00.480]  rights of indigenous peoples because respecting the rights and freedoms of the individual is
[1:03:00.480 --> 1:03:06.480]  intrinsically important it is fundamental to our values of people and as a nation it lifts
[1:03:06.480 --> 1:03:12.240]  all societies and nations too delivering better outcomes through economic inclusion so if you
[1:03:12.240 --> 1:03:19.040]  get vaccinated there will be special rules that apply to you women's empowerment environmental
[1:03:19.040 --> 1:03:25.520]  sustainability rising living standards and so much more australia's actions are guided by our belief
[1:03:25.520 --> 1:03:31.520]  in the inherent dignity of all people the edicts of social engineering waged upon the once free
[1:03:31.520 --> 1:03:42.400]  isolated nation as it becomes the proving ground for the great reset
[1:03:48.720 --> 1:03:54.880]  the united nation's de facto imperialism has even managed to threaten the very life blood of the
[1:03:54.880 --> 1:04:01.920]  australian economy call fewer than 10 years that's all the un has given us to close down our
[1:04:01.920 --> 1:04:07.120]  mining industries here in australia assistant secretary general selwyn hart released the
[1:04:07.120 --> 1:04:14.560]  un roadmap at a and use 2021 crawford leadership forum today hart warned oecd countries have until
[1:04:14.560 --> 1:04:21.760]  2030 to close their coal mining industries commit to a net zero target by 2050 and lift their ambitions
[1:04:21.760 --> 1:04:28.720]  to cut greenhouse gas emissions more swiftly the greens and their mega super profits tax
[1:04:28.720 --> 1:04:33.280]  going after the tycoons around every corner if the un gets its way and we get out of coal we
[1:04:33.280 --> 1:04:39.200]  won't have any companies to be taxed so the greens will defeat their own agenda if we stand up for
[1:04:39.200 --> 1:04:46.160]  australia we stand up for our own sovereignty and in the long run deliver the global elite the true
[1:04:46.160 --> 1:04:52.240]  enemy of all three peoples on this rock spinning on the same polar axis around the same sun a
[1:04:52.240 --> 1:04:59.680]  defeat they will never forget we the people are the true masters of the universe john bound reporting
[1:05:03.040 --> 1:05:07.840]  i have the greatest sense of loss deep in my heart deep in my soul i've ever had in my
[1:05:08.400 --> 1:05:14.560]  47 years on this planet i've had a lot of loss everybody else has and it's because
[1:05:14.560 --> 1:05:25.360]  it's a loss of ancestral freedom that so many people fought and died and bled and sweat for
[1:05:26.640 --> 1:05:33.360]  and now we're just throwing it all away and i see the general public in a medically induced
[1:05:33.360 --> 1:05:40.960]  scientifically induced behavioral psychologically controlled trans and i know we're being fed into
[1:05:40.960 --> 1:05:47.920]  this globalist meat grinder and it's so incredibly sad but this is the process of birth and then
[1:05:47.920 --> 1:05:53.440]  growth and then falling apart and then degenerating and collapsing and then coming back to life again
[1:05:54.320 --> 1:05:58.960]  it's just the globalists are actively trying to steer and control this process of decadence and
[1:05:58.960 --> 1:06:12.000]  collapse to actually end the species as we know it waging war on corruption it's alex jones
[1:06:12.000 --> 1:06:31.440]  coming to you live from the front lines of the info war that's right this whole new world order
[1:06:31.440 --> 1:06:37.600]  is nothing more than a satanic ritual against humanity and i want to thank you all for joining
[1:06:37.600 --> 1:06:42.800]  us there have been incredibly huge developments that we knew were coming that have now transpired
[1:06:42.800 --> 1:06:49.600]  and now unfolded in front of the world we are now into hour number two i want to hit a very
[1:06:49.600 --> 1:06:56.880]  important story that was in new yorker magazine and also on their podcast literally platforming
[1:06:56.880 --> 1:07:03.040]  a terrorist the new yorker takes heat for hosting climate activists arguing for blowing up pipelines
[1:07:03.040 --> 1:07:09.600]  so howard stern can say he wants to rape the dead columbine children or rape them to death that's
[1:07:09.600 --> 1:07:17.840]  okay but i get sued for questioning big public events as we should all question big public
[1:07:17.840 --> 1:07:28.160]  events and another mass shooting and if i got appearance said let's blow up federal buildings
[1:07:28.160 --> 1:07:34.720]  i would go to prison and i should but when they do it it's okay this isn't just literally
[1:07:34.720 --> 1:07:39.360]  platforming a terrorist this is having a terrorist on who says they've engaged in violence and burned
[1:07:39.360 --> 1:07:49.760]  things down to then be able to recruit people and to sell a manual on how to blow up pipelines
[1:07:51.360 --> 1:07:57.360]  we're going to get to that first in a moment and then this ties into the entire planet not
[1:07:57.360 --> 1:08:01.760]  just australia not just the united states feiser ceo says normal life won't return without regular
[1:08:01.760 --> 1:08:06.480]  covid vaccinations we've got his quote he goes on to say you won't be able to live without these shots
[1:08:08.720 --> 1:08:13.600]  that is saying you cannot live without me that's being held hostage that's the definition of not
[1:08:13.600 --> 1:08:19.040]  being your own person of being domesticated australia's chief health officer completely dashes any
[1:08:19.040 --> 1:08:25.200]  hope the country will return to normal one day says it's a permanent lockdown she already said that
[1:08:25.200 --> 1:08:31.280]  two weeks ago but now she said it specifically that's coming up but good news another hip hop superstar

[1:09:08.160 --> 1:09:12.160]  into replace the large portion of doctors and nurses that are smart and won't take the shots
[1:09:12.160 --> 1:09:18.880]  the experimental shots now she says they'll just put national guard in as your nurses and as your
[1:09:18.880 --> 1:09:24.000]  doctors wow with no training so talk about turning the hospitals into prison gulags these are

[1:09:30.560 --> 1:09:35.440]  ladies and gentlemen incredible videos that we're going to be getting to at the bottom of the hour
[1:09:36.080 --> 1:09:39.520]  not just the black folks being thrown at restaurants they don't have vaccine passports
[1:09:40.160 --> 1:09:47.840]  in new york but we've got them going around in new york with all those little stands selling
[1:09:47.840 --> 1:09:53.920]  apples and oranges and tomatoes and potatoes from little farms outside town that have always
[1:09:53.920 --> 1:09:59.280]  been left alone as they should be their small family operations well under the guise of covet
[1:09:59.280 --> 1:10:03.600]  they've now rounded them all up saying they don't have covet passports they're not enrolled
[1:10:03.600 --> 1:10:10.080]  in the covet business program they're not scanning people's uh phones to make sure they've got the
[1:10:10.080 --> 1:10:15.280]  covet passports so they throw away the thousands and thousands of dollars of good produce in those
[1:10:16.560 --> 1:10:23.280]  food deserts any excuse for tyranny any excuse for cracking down let us put this experimental
[1:10:23.280 --> 1:10:29.440]  shot nearby that causes heart attacks and cancer and blood clots and strokes or you can't buy or
[1:10:29.440 --> 1:10:38.320]  sell the mark of the beast is here it's all coming up but let's hit this right now literally
[1:10:38.320 --> 1:10:44.240]  platforming a terrorist the new yorker takes heat for hosting climate activists arguing for
[1:10:44.240 --> 1:10:49.840]  blowing up pipelines now i'm going to read this article and i'm going to play the audio for you
[1:10:49.840 --> 1:10:52.400]  but i want to explain something
[1:10:55.280 --> 1:11:01.440]  pita is the animal liberation front that's come out in court and the animal liberation front
[1:11:02.160 --> 1:11:06.560]  goes around burning down primate research facilities and other animal research facilities
[1:11:06.560 --> 1:11:11.840]  and then groups connected with it burning down ski resorts and earth first spiking trees with
[1:11:11.840 --> 1:11:17.520]  big spikes so when you cut it with a chainsaw it flies out and kills you and sabotaging bulldozers
[1:11:17.520 --> 1:11:23.920]  so they blow up their their extinction rebellion they're a post human group but they're funded by
[1:11:23.920 --> 1:11:28.320]  the big mega banks that have stolen all the money that control everything that are a thousand times
[1:11:28.320 --> 1:11:34.160]  more corrupt than burning made off who now own the world through fraud who want to train you to
[1:11:34.160 --> 1:11:40.000]  hate yourself and train you to basically be depopulated and train you to voluntarily be sterilized
[1:11:40.000 --> 1:11:45.760]  show that you then get a carbon credit ration if you agree to be sterilized or not have children
[1:11:45.760 --> 1:11:48.960]  that's all being proposed i told you decades ago it was coming now it's
[1:11:49.760 --> 1:11:50.560]  mainstream news
[1:11:54.800 --> 1:11:59.760]  so continuing this whole group doesn't care about the animals this whole group doesn't
[1:11:59.760 --> 1:12:04.720]  care about humanity they care about power they want to guilt you into joining their cult of
[1:12:04.720 --> 1:12:12.160]  hating fellow humans that's how they wrap their Nazi ideology their their their uber mention
[1:12:12.160 --> 1:12:20.160]  ideology into something they claim is altruistic and helpful and so you don't see earth first and
[1:12:20.160 --> 1:12:31.280]  all these groups calling for stopping chinese pipelines or syrian pipelines or iraqi pipelines
[1:12:31.280 --> 1:12:38.880]  or russian pipelines they only want to shut down canadian american australian and new zealand
[1:12:38.880 --> 1:12:43.840]  pipelines because those are all countries that had some freedom and they're a bad example of the
[1:12:43.840 --> 1:12:48.080]  world you want to get rid of those so the whole world is under a new globalist corporate tyranny
[1:12:48.080 --> 1:12:56.000]  that basically looks like communist china and so when you hear all this oh we want to help the
[1:12:56.000 --> 1:13:01.680]  little people that's why you block commuter trains in london that's why you block the highways and
[1:13:01.680 --> 1:13:05.680]  make people crash and die that's why these environmental groups have been caught all over
[1:13:05.680 --> 1:13:12.880]  the country derailing trains and in almost every case of derailments it's the left derailing trains
[1:13:12.880 --> 1:13:18.720]  because they're seen as bad antifa earth first others and then the feds who are in on it they
[1:13:18.720 --> 1:13:24.880]  cover it up while it happens because they believe in what's going on and so that's why they're
[1:13:26.080 --> 1:13:31.680]  literally platforming a terrorist who's written a book let's start reading the article
[1:13:31.680 --> 1:13:36.240]  in full wars dot com literally platforming a terrorist the new worker takes heat for hosting
[1:13:36.240 --> 1:13:40.720]  climate activists arguing for blowing up pipelines see they've got free speech but when you then
[1:13:40.720 --> 1:13:47.920]  have a manual and say it's time to get violent while if you walked into the capital on january

[1:14:22.560 --> 1:14:28.320]  it's america you're focused on because you're supported by the establishment by all the big
[1:14:28.320 --> 1:14:33.120]  publications by the big media you're not censored you're boosting online commentators are up in
[1:14:33.120 --> 1:14:37.920]  arms over the recent edition of the new yorkers podcast discussing whether the climate movement
[1:14:37.920 --> 1:14:43.840]  should embrace sabotage which saw one of the featured guest ecology professor lond university
[1:14:43.840 --> 1:14:49.920]  in sweden andres mom argued that pipelines can be attacked for the sake of saving the environment
[1:14:50.640 --> 1:14:57.600]  mom who released a book titled how to blow up a pipeline learning to fight a world on fire by
[1:14:57.600 --> 1:15:02.720]  starting fires early this year appeared to endorse the ransomware attack that shut down
[1:15:02.720 --> 1:15:09.200]  colonial pipeline in may causing gasly towards the u.s and appeared to call for a tax against
[1:15:09.920 --> 1:15:17.200]  a total and china cnooc 3.5 billion crude pipeline in uganda and tansania so an
[1:15:17.200 --> 1:15:22.960]  earnest enemy is saying whoever china if people in that region were to attack the construction
[1:15:22.960 --> 1:15:29.040]  equipment or blow up the pipeline before it's completed it would be a favor of that i would
[1:15:29.040 --> 1:15:34.560]  be in favor of that i don't see how the property damage could be considered morally illegitimate
[1:15:35.360 --> 1:15:40.000]  even what we knew of the consequences of the projects he said and he goes on to endorse it

[1:19:04.720 --> 1:19:10.800]  and there is plenty to be afraid of today half the population has lined up for an untested deadly
[1:19:10.800 --> 1:19:15.520]  and debilitating experimental injection because they were told to be afraid of an invisible
[1:19:15.520 --> 1:19:21.040]  asymptomatic disease the perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80
[1:19:21.040 --> 1:19:27.200]  percent of the population hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years
[1:19:27.200 --> 1:19:31.840]  for those of us who have awoken from the spell we know this is all really happening and it's
[1:19:31.840 --> 1:19:38.240]  unbelievably unsettling to see but there is only two things to do we continue sounding the alarm
[1:19:38.240 --> 1:19:43.360]  because it's a numbers game if enough people awaken from the cold spell then we win but even
[1:19:43.360 --> 1:19:48.960]  when we win and we eventually will the days of convenience are soon coming to an end and so

[1:20:03.680 --> 1:20:33.040]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show so let me try to calm down as I
[1:20:33.040 --> 1:20:36.560]  attempt to rush through all this information and expose it and just pull back here
[1:20:39.440 --> 1:20:46.640]  on the Alex Jones show for a moment and have us ask ourselves what's happening
[1:20:48.240 --> 1:20:50.400]  well we've got a lot of advanced technology we've developed
[1:20:52.400 --> 1:20:55.200]  and we have a global establishment that believes there's too many people
[1:20:56.400 --> 1:20:58.400]  you can certainly agree with some of those arguments
[1:20:58.400 --> 1:21:05.600]  but they have turned loose a bunch of psychotic satanic leftist
[1:21:08.880 --> 1:21:12.720]  who are running around actually saying humans are parasites and that we should all be
[1:21:12.720 --> 1:21:18.240]  extinct and that we are a failed evil species and then that's the wall street journal that's
[1:21:18.240 --> 1:21:23.120]  the new york times that's who these groups are these are very hateful horrible people
[1:21:23.120 --> 1:21:28.160]  who are almost always associated with occultism and child molestation
[1:21:29.920 --> 1:21:32.880]  the jackabins the the french revolution the illuminati
[1:21:36.880 --> 1:21:39.360]  and then you've got the new yorker magazine the
[1:21:41.600 --> 1:21:44.880]  sycophantic fop factory
[1:21:47.280 --> 1:21:52.480]  that takes itself so incredibly seriously along with all the other mainstream news
[1:21:52.480 --> 1:21:56.640]  promoting and endorsing black lives matter and anti for burning down billions of dollars
[1:21:56.640 --> 1:22:03.200]  and killing and wounding countless people and you've got them worshiping and just oh
[1:22:03.200 --> 1:22:07.920]  promoting the overthrow of local governments because they're bringing in their corporate
[1:22:07.920 --> 1:22:12.560]  global government they are the establishment they are the leading edge of the system
[1:22:13.680 --> 1:22:18.160]  and then you've got new yorker magazine and so many others about drastic actions needed
[1:22:18.160 --> 1:22:26.400]  we've got a book about how you blow up a pipeline which ends up producing thousands of
[1:22:26.400 --> 1:22:30.480]  times the damage that a pipeline would ever create they hardly ever leak or have problems
[1:22:30.480 --> 1:22:35.600]  but you're going to blow on up it's going to leak for days of not weeks but you're not worried
[1:22:35.600 --> 1:22:39.920]  about that you're just worried about your power your control and claiming the carbon dioxide
[1:22:39.920 --> 1:22:48.560]  that comes from oil and gasoline and natural gas is so bad that you're doing it but but it's only
[1:22:49.520 --> 1:22:53.520]  the colonial pipeline and the keystone pipeline and all these systems being shut down by biden
[1:22:54.080 --> 1:23:01.200]  and now america has to import russian and middle eastern oil which the globalist control it was
[1:23:01.200 --> 1:23:06.240]  just about not having small operators and small oil wells and small gas wells because here we've
[1:23:06.240 --> 1:23:11.520]  got thousands of people thousands of companies that go drill for oil there's only a handful in
[1:23:11.520 --> 1:23:16.480]  the middle east a handful in russia a handful in africa with the chinese running it and it's
[1:23:16.480 --> 1:23:21.920]  big monopolies you actually go look at who funds these environmental groups bp's the biggest xon
[1:23:21.920 --> 1:23:28.320]  mobile dutch roll shell are the biggest funders of the carbon taxes it was in ron developed the
[1:23:28.320 --> 1:23:35.040]  plan in the late 80s for the carbon taxes they control their opposition as they block new energy
[1:23:35.040 --> 1:23:40.320]  and new free energy systems bring in windmills that don't work act like they're giving you new
[1:23:40.320 --> 1:23:44.800]  technology to electric cars that use more carbon even if you believe they're arguing the carbon's
[1:23:44.800 --> 1:23:51.600]  bad what you see is not really what's going on remember i made films like in game 14 years ago
[1:23:51.600 --> 1:23:55.840]  about carbon taxes and the media wrote articles saying jones is crazy nobody's planning carbon
[1:23:55.840 --> 1:24:01.920]  taxes but that was always where this was taking us so here's the big new york establishment
[1:24:01.920 --> 1:24:06.800]  publication saying if people in that region were to attack the construction equipment or blow up the
[1:24:06.800 --> 1:24:12.240]  pipeline before it's completed i would be all for that i don't see how property damage could be
[1:24:12.800 --> 1:24:16.560]  considered morally illegitimate well when people don't have jobs they starve to death there just
[1:24:16.560 --> 1:24:21.920]  like a lockdown dead given what we know about the consequences of such projects oh all your fake
[1:24:21.920 --> 1:24:29.440]  bs numbers mom boasted about his role in property destruction campaign for the sake of a noble cause
[1:24:29.440 --> 1:24:33.200]  what do i say it's noble and come burn down your house i'm not going to do that i'm just saying
[1:24:34.080 --> 1:24:39.920]  mom boasted about his own role in a property destruction campaign for the sake of a noble
[1:24:39.920 --> 1:24:46.800]  cause saying that his group slashed the tires of thousands of suvs 2017 in sweden arguing that the
[1:24:46.800 --> 1:24:53.360]  acts of vandalism led to a drop in demand for the vehicles from your terrorism yeah i've had somebody
[1:24:53.360 --> 1:24:58.800]  knock out my suvs windows twice in austin speaking about peaceful climate protests including the
[1:24:58.800 --> 1:25:04.000]  school strike movement led by granithunberg mom said he doesn't not mind these tactics but it's
[1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:09.840]  frustrated about activist dogmatic commitment to non-violence the left's all about violence when
[1:25:09.840 --> 1:25:14.560]  it's them but if we get tricked into any type of violence it's not called misdemeanors it's called
[1:25:14.560 --> 1:25:23.520]  insurrection the greatest crime in history let's go to some of the podcast which i agree with
[1:25:23.520 --> 1:25:27.600]  their free speech i don't agree he should be selling a book saying go out and blow up pipelines
[1:25:27.600 --> 1:25:32.720]  that's a call to terrorism but remember i'm censored he's not look at this little demented
[1:25:32.720 --> 1:25:39.760]  tool of the establishment now you've gone from deflating tires to writing a book now in 2021
[1:25:39.760 --> 1:25:45.200]  called how to blow up a pipeline um what was the moment that you realized that your next book would
[1:25:45.200 --> 1:25:54.160]  have to be about targeted sabotage and why that moment was very much the summer of 2018
[1:25:54.160 --> 1:26:00.160]  which was unprecedented in northern europe for the wildfires and the drought and the heat wave
[1:26:01.040 --> 1:26:08.640]  and during that summer i felt panic and desperation uh as a lot of people did this was the summer that
[1:26:08.640 --> 1:26:14.880]  led grieta tunberg to start her later very famous school strike movements all eyes and that sort of
[1:26:14.880 --> 1:26:20.320]  changed the picture because in 2019 all the way to the pandemic the climate movement of the global
[1:26:20.320 --> 1:26:26.320]  north reached its zenith of mobilization really it's its peak of popular force out of the streets
[1:26:27.440 --> 1:26:34.240]  so the book became a became a product of the moment of 2019 but it's also a core for escalation
[1:26:34.240 --> 1:26:45.840]  a call for the movement to diversify its tactics and move away from an exclusive focus on polite
[1:26:45.840 --> 1:26:52.800]  gentle and perfectly peaceful civil disobedience what are your actions are you recommending for
[1:26:52.800 --> 1:27:00.400]  the movement well i am recommending that the movement continues with mass action and civil
[1:27:00.400 --> 1:27:05.840]  disobedience but also opens up for proper destruction so i'm not saying we should stop
[1:27:05.840 --> 1:27:12.720]  strikes or or square occupations or demonstrations of the usual kind i'm all in favor of that but
[1:27:12.720 --> 1:27:19.040]  i do think we need to step up because so little has changed and so many investments are still
[1:27:19.040 --> 1:27:26.160]  being poured into new fossil fuel projects so i am in favor of of destroying machines property
[1:27:26.160 --> 1:27:33.600]  not harming people that's a very uh very important distinction there and i think property can be
[1:27:33.600 --> 1:27:38.720]  destroyed in all manner of ways or it can be neutralized for in a very gentle fashion as when
[1:27:38.720 --> 1:27:44.560]  we defeated the suv's or in a more spectacular fashion as in potentially blowing up a pipeline
[1:27:44.560 --> 1:27:49.040]  that's under construction that's something that people have done so you so you are recommending
[1:27:49.040 --> 1:27:53.600]  blowing up a pipeline you use the phrase intelligence sabotage what is yeah what does
[1:27:53.600 --> 1:27:58.320]  intelligence sabotage look like in this context well let me give you a very concrete example
[1:27:58.320 --> 1:28:04.480]  right now total the largest single private company headquartered in france is constructing what will
[1:28:04.480 --> 1:28:12.320]  be the world's longest heated oil pipeline in uganda and tanzania and displacing in that process
[1:28:12.320 --> 1:28:19.200]  about a hundred and thousand farmers all for the sake of carrying even more oil to the world market
[1:28:19.200 --> 1:28:24.960]  to oh yeah let's stop right there on what what what displaces the the farmers is not building
[1:28:24.960 --> 1:28:28.800]  the pipeline they either put them above ground or below ground towns build up around it the
[1:28:28.800 --> 1:28:32.960]  property goes up for everybody's value and the africans are all begging for this they want to
[1:28:32.960 --> 1:28:41.040]  be industrialized absolute pure crap so again and i guarantee you research this guy he's a post
[1:28:41.040 --> 1:28:45.680]  humanist they all are they sell you to be guilty so they can engage whatever activity they want
[1:28:45.680 --> 1:28:51.040]  which is terrorism i mean just look at that fruit cake i mean let me tell you i'm not saying he's a
[1:28:51.040 --> 1:28:54.560]  child molester i'm just saying i was going to cast money for a hollywood movie that like kid
[1:28:54.560 --> 1:29:01.520]  naps kids and eats them it'd be this guy him and bryan stelter to the right back attention radio

[1:29:26.800 --> 1:29:32.560]  but did you know that there's been times in the past during times of extreme hardship when americans
[1:29:32.560 --> 1:29:38.640]  put another store of value above even silver and gold it's true open pollinated seeds have been

[1:33:31.840 --> 1:33:38.560]  i have a very special guest that heads up a very large national organization that supports trump
[1:33:39.520 --> 1:33:48.560]  and uh she is a friend of a friend of the show and they couldn't get any medical help in dallas
[1:33:49.440 --> 1:33:53.040]  when she was traveling and had covid this is the new covid the real covid
[1:33:54.160 --> 1:33:58.960]  or whatever it is they released and she was deathly ill and couldn't even move and if she'd
[1:33:58.960 --> 1:34:04.400]  gone to the hospital they'd have killed her probably and so we got a doctor to call in
[1:34:04.400 --> 1:34:10.560]  subscriptions to her prescriptions to her and of of ivermectin and budesodine the rest of it
[1:34:10.560 --> 1:34:16.960]  and they in dallas wouldn't give it to her so we got in a car and drove it up to her called to
[1:34:16.960 --> 1:34:21.760]  see how she was the next day she was back on the road driving home 90 better just like my dad
[1:34:21.760 --> 1:34:30.960]  so this stuff works i'm not selling budesodine or hydroxychloroquine or ivermectin
[1:34:32.480 --> 1:34:35.520]  and it just shows what these criminals are doing and how they're surprising people so it's not just
[1:34:35.520 --> 1:34:39.520]  all the studies saying this stuff works i've experienced it she's going to join us for 30
[1:34:39.520 --> 1:34:44.480]  minutes next hour then we'll continue uh with news and information today but let me just finish
[1:34:44.480 --> 1:34:52.720]  with that story i was just covering you have new yorker magazine promoting someone who was written
[1:34:52.720 --> 1:34:58.560]  a book on how to blow up pipelines and saying you should go out and blow up things and and and do all
[1:34:58.560 --> 1:35:03.920]  this and notice he says now is the time to get violent it's like claus swab till the left now
[1:35:03.920 --> 1:35:07.760]  is the time to get violent and now is the time to crack down the general population to cause
[1:35:07.760 --> 1:35:12.320]  violence which they believe they can then steer in control to bring down the nation states and on
[1:35:12.320 --> 1:35:19.440]  its ashes build a one-world government that's why rickardo bossy former head of the uh special
[1:35:19.440 --> 1:35:26.080]  forces of australia a very prominent respected guy he came out and said we do not want to be
[1:35:26.080 --> 1:35:32.240]  covertly or overtly violent we don't want to be offensively violent we don't want to be violent
[1:35:33.040 --> 1:35:38.640]  we want to go out in civil disobedience and when they're violent to us that hurts them
[1:35:38.640 --> 1:35:41.520]  that's why they're getting more violent not to intimidate they know what's going to make more
[1:35:41.520 --> 1:35:46.640]  people come out but to try to finally get you to be violent that's how ghandi kicked the british
[1:35:46.640 --> 1:35:51.840]  empire out it's it's how the civil rights act got passed so everybody out there commenting on
[1:35:51.840 --> 1:35:56.560]  info wars i see a minority of folks going oh you're just a wimp jones you and rickardo bossy we need
[1:35:56.560 --> 1:36:04.640]  violence you know nothing ever gets fixed without it the founders for 20 years tried to fix things
[1:36:04.640 --> 1:36:08.880]  and woke a large part of the public up then the british got violent started shooting people
[1:36:08.880 --> 1:36:14.080]  confiscating guns and when they started shooting people then it started and yeah if the cops start
[1:36:14.080 --> 1:36:18.480]  actually shooting people then it's going to go there and i'm just saying it's very important
[1:36:18.480 --> 1:36:22.320]  that we realize it's the globalist that ran this you want to go after the head of the snake
[1:36:22.960 --> 1:36:27.920]  i'm not proposing violence like uh the left is and carrying it out i'm saying it's a fight
[1:36:27.920 --> 1:36:32.000]  they're starting it's a fight we're trying to overt they know we're winning politically and
[1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:36.640]  culturally that's why they're engaged in election fraud and trying to stop us from stopping their
[1:36:36.640 --> 1:36:41.120]  fraud that's why they're trying to go ahead and get a civil war going depending on the demographics
[1:36:41.120 --> 1:36:46.560]  and sociology of each country they manipulate it's taylor made for each one this is all public
[1:36:46.560 --> 1:36:51.040]  it's in the damn wiki leaks they they don't hide it how schwaab admits they're doing this so
[1:36:53.440 --> 1:36:59.440]  discretion is the better part of valor we're right to try to overt violence but everyone
[1:36:59.440 --> 1:37:04.800]  should be prepared for every eventuality now here's john carrey in a report by john bound
[1:37:04.800 --> 1:37:09.520]  that i already aired last week i want to play a clip out of it dealing with the fact that the
[1:37:09.520 --> 1:37:14.080]  tyranny is just beginning is the name of the piece where john carrey was on tv last week and said
[1:37:14.880 --> 1:37:19.680]  oh we don't care if people get reelected to governments and stop carbon taxes or the shut
[1:37:19.680 --> 1:37:23.760]  down of pipelines or the shut down of coal power plants that india and china and mexico are building
[1:37:23.760 --> 1:37:31.280]  more of only us in the west are shut down he said because the corporations are going to implement
[1:37:31.280 --> 1:37:38.000]  this and they're foot soldiers so they have their leftist communist anti-human exterminist
[1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:43.520]  depopulation 12 monkey army and then they've got the big corporations pressure from above
[1:37:43.520 --> 1:37:47.760]  pressure from below this is what they're doing this is an elitist revolution where they have all
[1:37:47.760 --> 1:37:52.560]  the fiat money now they want to make us all poor so they can get control of our lives this is about
[1:37:52.560 --> 1:38:01.360]  social engineering i met with a very respected cpa that's known nationwide it's one of the best and
[1:38:01.360 --> 1:38:06.720]  he said alex you know the us tax code is not about raising money it's about social engineering i said
[1:38:06.720 --> 1:38:10.720]  i do know that he said well the public doesn't and he was explaining me stuff i didn't even understand
[1:38:10.720 --> 1:38:17.440]  but i that's why i'm always learning and so this is a known thing this is social engineering and
[1:38:17.440 --> 1:38:23.680]  now they're bullying you now they're saying you're not essential now they're locking up in your house
[1:38:23.680 --> 1:38:29.200]  here's what john carrey had to say not some people russia and china for example say well
[1:38:29.200 --> 1:38:34.240]  you know history tells us that he can make all the promises he wants for 2030 there's a good
[1:38:34.240 --> 1:38:37.440]  chance the republicans will be back in power by then and change everything well let me tell you
[1:38:37.440 --> 1:38:44.960]  why that won't happen because the major corporations of the world including in the united states are
[1:38:44.960 --> 1:38:50.240]  all moving in this direction and no politician is going to turn them around once they've committed
[1:38:50.240 --> 1:38:56.160]  trillions of dollars to this endeavor that's just not going to happen all right paul joseph watson
[1:38:56.160 --> 1:39:02.800]  from london has another report that's up on info wars dot com we're never going back to normal says
[1:39:02.800 --> 1:39:11.040]  australia's national quote health head and that's what fiserhead is also saying think of the level
[1:39:11.040 --> 1:39:16.560]  of this how they're just announcing it like it's no big deal and we have to accept it 15 days the
[1:39:16.560 --> 1:39:22.080]  flat in the curve now is a millennium of slavery under us putting in your body what we want when
[1:39:22.080 --> 1:39:25.520]  you want and telling you when you can leave your house according to an app here's part of the report
[1:39:26.080 --> 1:39:32.400]  a scowling face of australia's dystopian covet nightmare has let slip the truth no matter how
[1:39:32.400 --> 1:39:38.960]  hard you comply no matter how much you humiliate yourselves life is never returning to normal dr
[1:39:38.960 --> 1:39:44.880]  kerry chan to previously ordered australians not to even talk to each other don't start up a conversation
[1:39:44.880 --> 1:39:51.120]  now admits that some restrictions will remain in place even if everyone takes regular booster
[1:39:51.120 --> 1:39:57.840]  shots that stress we will not be ever having to go back to pre-covid levels we're always
[1:39:57.840 --> 1:40:02.720]  going to have to be mindful that covet exists we're going to have to engage with booster shots
[1:40:02.720 --> 1:40:08.080]  we're going to have to engage with advice from time to time when we see outbreaks we're going to
[1:40:08.080 --> 1:40:13.120]  have to respond so it's it's not going to go back to normal we can't deny that we're going to have
[1:40:13.120 --> 1:40:19.600]  to live with covet but having those very high vaccination levels will allow us to have more
[1:40:19.600 --> 1:40:27.440]  minimal restrictions or more minimal public health measures in place as we as we navigate the future
[1:40:27.440 --> 1:40:35.200]  years with covet keep complying idiots meanwhile huge packs of police continue to hunt down
[1:40:35.200 --> 1:40:38.400]  dangerous criminals for not wearing masks outside
[1:40:47.120 --> 1:40:51.600]  two guys in sydney were pursued by a cop car after being spotted out not wearing masks they
[1:40:51.600 --> 1:40:56.400]  desperately tried to duck into a gas station to buy them and even though they were wearing them
[1:40:56.400 --> 1:41:01.680]  when they stepped outside the cops aggressively pounced and arrested them a news station reported
[1:41:01.680 --> 1:41:10.480]  that by the end of the incident 50 cops were on the scene one down in handcuffs the other cops
[1:41:10.480 --> 1:41:15.840]  five knees to his wrist they quickly outnumbered by the police backup well the sydney police
[1:41:17.440 --> 1:41:23.680]  i have a 50 police i have a 50 police they block everything 50 cops in response to two guys
[1:41:23.680 --> 1:41:28.720]  seen not wearing masks in melbourne another guy was surrounded and arrested for the crime of not
[1:41:28.720 --> 1:41:36.240]  wearing a mask outside okay but we have a situation where there's a coronavirus out there
[1:41:36.240 --> 1:41:40.560]  and the survival rate is slightly below 100 percent and i'm not willing to accept that the
[1:41:40.560 --> 1:41:44.320]  government's willing to shut down businesses destroy people's lives and to enforce the
[1:41:44.320 --> 1:42:09.360]  abusive policy that's carried out by you guys you should probably tell me why before you
[1:42:09.360 --> 1:42:23.680]  quit me all right folks the full report is quote we're never going back to normal and you're like
[1:42:23.680 --> 1:42:28.000]  oh that's just australia why is john so obsessed with it no australia admits they're a beta test
[1:42:28.880 --> 1:42:32.480]  and i even had a guest on again a former leader of australian special forces
[1:42:34.240 --> 1:42:38.480]  explaining from their own documents how they planned all this so it's unbelievable when we
[1:42:38.480 --> 1:42:46.400]  come back feiser ceo says that without vaccine you are not going to be able to live that's a quote
[1:42:46.400 --> 1:42:51.360]  so talk about holding people hostage that's it it's now official they're going to put in your
[1:42:51.360 --> 1:42:56.080]  body what they want when they want and it doesn't protect you and your presence forever that's the
[1:42:56.080 --> 1:43:03.920]  wages of sin it's death stay with us finally vitamin d3 and vitamin k that are both essential
[1:43:03.920 --> 1:43:08.080]  are getting the respect and the attention they deserve we've got a great product it's been
[1:43:08.080 --> 1:43:12.880]  out for six years winter sun long before the big crisis came along we were there saying
[1:43:12.880 --> 1:43:16.880]  this is high quality this will make you healthy this will be better for you and your family but
[1:43:16.880 --> 1:43:22.800]  what else doesn't get attention and needs to be looked at is vitamin b12 it is just as essential
[1:43:22.800 --> 1:43:27.680]  it is just as important and it is amazing and it's not just about your immune system it's about
[1:43:27.680 --> 1:43:33.760]  every part of your body it's it's really a hormone and it's what your building blocks of your entire
[1:43:33.760 --> 1:43:41.040]  body operate off of so these vitamins are essential vitamin d3 and of course vitamin b12 go together
[1:43:41.040 --> 1:43:45.760]  like a horse and carriage do your own research we've got the highest grades you're going to find
[1:43:45.760 --> 1:43:50.320]  out there and they're taken under the tongue it's key to put it under the tongue for about a minute

[1:43:56.160 --> 1:44:02.960]  dot com together or buy themselves at 50 percent off at 25 percent off so the placebo that they have
[1:44:02.960 --> 1:44:10.400]  used that the fda has allowed them to use has often been another vaccine a vaccine with a known
[1:44:10.400 --> 1:44:17.440]  adverse reaction profile that's causing death and damage in its own right that it's the aluminum
[1:44:18.000 --> 1:44:24.480]  as an adjuvant in the vaccine a known neurotoxin a known immunotoxin a known poison in human beings
[1:44:24.480 --> 1:44:30.880]  that is in the supposedly inert placebo totally inappropriate this is not good science it is
[1:44:30.880 --> 1:44:38.000]  not science at all it is an effort to cover up the true adverse reaction rates to the vaccines
[1:44:38.000 --> 1:44:44.720]  so that they can get through the low barrier of constraints put there by the fda and onto the
[1:44:44.720 --> 1:44:50.720]  market that is the only concern dr wakefield is just one of many informed voices in the film covet

[1:47:40.240 --> 1:47:46.160]  welcome back ladies and gentlemen to the alex jones show we have a special guest kimberly
[1:47:46.160 --> 1:47:54.720]  fletcher who heads up moms for america dot us and she got super sick from covid and we got her a
[1:47:54.720 --> 1:47:58.720]  doctor and they wouldn't fill the prescription so we had to give her our medicine and she got
[1:47:58.720 --> 1:48:04.800]  better in one day she's also talking about trump coming back the election news i'm going to hit
[1:48:04.800 --> 1:48:11.440]  all that cnn saying this is a dangerous time america can't survive if we question election
[1:48:11.440 --> 1:48:18.080]  integrity you're not supposed to do that said brian stelter that's coming up next hour as well
[1:48:18.080 --> 1:48:27.040]  well but let me talk about something really really really serious here for everybody
[1:48:30.240 --> 1:48:36.320]  we are in an information war and the new world order would not be censoring everybody and trying
[1:48:36.320 --> 1:48:45.360]  to take control of civilization and society if our speech wasn't powerful they wouldn't
[1:48:45.360 --> 1:48:50.000]  be trying to restrict our speech and what we say and what we do if we didn't have a very good
[1:48:50.000 --> 1:48:54.800]  shot of defeating them and in fact they know they've been able unable to suppress us now
[1:48:56.080 --> 1:49:02.160]  so now they've gotten to the point of where they sit there and just say don't listen to facts anymore
[1:49:03.920 --> 1:49:10.160]  don't investigate don't read the fine print i showed you six news articles at the start of the show
[1:49:10.160 --> 1:49:17.120]  that aren't tongue-in-cheek from mainstream news saying do not question reality do not question
[1:49:17.120 --> 1:49:23.440]  government or corporations again that'd be like if you went to see about a elementary school for
[1:49:23.440 --> 1:49:28.560]  your son or daughter and they said you can't come in you can't talk to the children you can't
[1:49:29.120 --> 1:49:33.680]  be involved you can't come to anything at the school you can't ask to see a report card you just
[1:49:33.680 --> 1:49:40.480]  turn your child over to us into this black box and then just hope we raise them right you would never
[1:49:41.600 --> 1:49:46.960]  put your child in that situation willingly but that's what this whole new world order this whole
[1:49:46.960 --> 1:49:53.040]  vaccine all of this is telling you to blindly trust and that that will make you strong and i read
[1:49:53.040 --> 1:50:02.960]  you news articles from the new york times and cnn and others saying it's good to not question
[1:50:02.960 --> 1:50:06.800]  it's good to turn your brain off it's good to do what you're told
[1:50:09.120 --> 1:50:13.760]  no it's good to question these known liars and then when you know they're lying it's good to
[1:50:13.760 --> 1:50:19.520]  not comply with them and not submit to them and to pull yourself back and away from them so
[1:50:21.200 --> 1:50:26.320]  i want listeners to understand that this broadcast and and this audience of activists
[1:50:26.320 --> 1:50:33.680]  is the core of the resistance you are the tip of the spear and the entire future of humanity is in
[1:50:33.680 --> 1:50:38.880]  your hands and you're incredibly powerful and the fact that you care and have that connection to god
[1:50:38.880 --> 1:50:43.600]  and that connection to curiosity and that connection to wanting to build a better future means you are
[1:50:43.600 --> 1:50:50.160]  the salt of the earth you are the future seeds that are going to sprout into a great harvest
[1:50:50.160 --> 1:50:56.720]  of awakening and so everything we do here by itself is not going to save the world but our
[1:50:56.720 --> 1:51:01.600]  action to save the world our caring to save the world our moral resistance to tyranny and our
[1:51:01.600 --> 1:51:06.960]  standing up will be part of that continuum of the struggle and in the end with god's help
[1:51:06.960 --> 1:51:13.680]  we'll save our species and take us to levels never before even dreamed of and so i want to
[1:51:13.680 --> 1:51:18.240]  encourage listeners now while you still can as the censorship intensifies who knows how long
[1:51:18.240 --> 1:51:24.720]  we'll be here to get hard copies of films for your archives so you can burn digital copies
[1:51:24.720 --> 1:51:29.600]  and share them in the future as you can make dvd copies and so you can re upload them when and
[1:51:29.600 --> 1:51:35.760]  where you can in resistance because as things get worse whereas people wouldn't listen to us 20 years
[1:51:35.760 --> 1:51:41.120]  ago they listen now and as things get 10 times worse people will take what you and i and others
[1:51:41.120 --> 1:51:48.560]  speak about that's come true as gospel and we'll use that information to defeat the globalist
[1:51:49.360 --> 1:51:55.760]  so our greatest work isn't even in our lifetimes our greatest work isn't even for those of us living
[1:51:55.760 --> 1:52:04.080]  today on september 27 2021 it will be for those that carry the torch forward as we carry the torch
[1:52:04.080 --> 1:52:09.600]  from those before us into the present into the future and we hand the torch over as we collapse
[1:52:09.600 --> 1:52:16.000]  into dust but our life goes on through those individuals true eternal life through the genetic
[1:52:16.000 --> 1:52:24.080]  line but continuing at levels above as well only one facet of our eternal spirit manifest in front
[1:52:24.080 --> 1:52:32.000]  of us in this dimension as we know it to be called life flowing through the spacetime continuum as the
[1:52:32.000 --> 1:52:38.320]  living water and the will of god the genetic creation that we are and all the beauty and the
[1:52:38.320 --> 1:52:46.480]  conception and the worship that comes from it and so in that we need to take action and so all of you
[1:52:47.120 --> 1:52:52.960]  all of you need to not wait and go to infowarstore.com or covenland.com and get your copy of covenland
[1:52:52.960 --> 1:52:57.680]  the lockdown part one the chronicles their lies their fraud how they locked us down and then what
[1:52:57.680 --> 1:53:03.120]  they were doing in the future so that people will have it to educate others to understand how these
[1:53:03.120 --> 1:53:08.000]  criminals carry this out because they're expunging off the internet the old history of their old lies
[1:53:08.000 --> 1:53:13.440]  for new because when the compendium of lies is shown it wakes up basically everybody that sees it
[1:53:13.440 --> 1:53:20.880]  this is designed to wake up the general public get your copy at covenland.com for 1995 and then get

[1:53:25.440 --> 1:53:30.080]  and the whole plan and the predictions of what was coming that you now see unfold in covenland
[1:53:30.080 --> 1:53:35.360]  14 years later you can make copies of both both our zero country code meaning they work
[1:53:35.360 --> 1:53:40.800]  anywhere in the world we've made the films we've taken the action now the rest is up to you the

[1:54:57.840 --> 1:55:02.240]  deep rest will sleep and of course the t-shirt sale will end today i should have mentioned that
[1:55:02.240 --> 1:55:09.040]  995 for the low-cost shirts 1495 for the more expensive designer ones it averages out where
[1:55:09.040 --> 1:55:14.560]  the shirts are all being sold in ball caps at cost at infowarstore.com and i want to thank all
[1:55:14.560 --> 1:55:18.720]  of our affiliates please support our local radio stations become a sponsor support their sponsors
[1:55:18.720 --> 1:55:23.520]  just make a flat donation he was their commercial radio station these shows are doing more to expose
[1:55:23.520 --> 1:55:28.800]  the devil and the abortion and the satanic pedophile rings than your mainline church and
[1:55:28.800 --> 1:55:33.120]  i'm not putting your churches down but most of them are cowardly i'm just saying that your local
[1:55:33.120 --> 1:55:38.000]  station secular station putting us on the air is doing light years more than probably most of
[1:55:38.000 --> 1:55:41.840]  churches in your town combined so i would mail them 20 bucks a month 100 bucks a month and tell
[1:55:41.840 --> 1:55:45.920]  them it's because alex joneshows on i can't tell you how that has gotten stations to take us from
[1:55:45.920 --> 1:55:50.080]  being on at night to being on during the day and we've reached so many new people so if you're
[1:55:50.080 --> 1:55:54.320]  listening to us on station spread the word about the station and support them and and don't count
[1:55:54.320 --> 1:55:59.280]  on others to take action you're taking action is what's going to win this war and again i think
[1:55:59.280 --> 1:56:04.480]  if you're a support we are trying to fund ourselves and last year we dug out of a big hole we were
[1:56:04.480 --> 1:56:09.280]  in thanks to you and then because of the covid lockdowns the supply chain broke down and so
[1:56:09.280 --> 1:56:13.200]  you've noticed most of our best-selling items have been sold out for six months eight months nine
[1:56:13.200 --> 1:56:19.200]  months even a year because we have a high quality organic ingredients in our supplements and so
[1:56:19.200 --> 1:56:22.400]  that when when something's got a bunch of ingredients and you can't get one of the ingredients
[1:56:22.400 --> 1:56:26.880]  you just can't put it out and so we're gonna i don't know what we're gonna do uh that that's
[1:56:26.880 --> 1:56:31.200]  been a big problem and so i've tried to bring on some sponsors i've tried to you know plug some
[1:56:31.200 --> 1:56:36.960]  other things but i'm just t-shirts and coffee cup sales you know don't cut it uh so i want to thank
[1:56:36.960 --> 1:56:42.080]  you all that continue to get the products that we do have in uh and winter sun is excellent so
[1:56:42.080 --> 1:56:46.480]  is vitamin b12 for the ultra 12 but uh that's going to run out too so we have to end that sell
[1:56:46.480 --> 1:56:50.480]  tomorrow it'll be months till more of that comes in but because they're one ingredient items very
[1:56:50.480 --> 1:56:54.800]  high quality we're able to get them it's the five six ten twenty ingredient items that are really
[1:56:54.800 --> 1:56:59.680]  really rough because uh again the globalists are invoking a worldwide depression by design there's
[1:56:59.680 --> 1:57:08.720]  zero hedge panic buying could leave 90 of uk gas stations dry and here in the u.s. cosco limits
[1:57:08.720 --> 1:57:14.480]  purchase of toilet paper paper towels and bottled water amid inflation supply chain issues yeah it's
[1:57:14.480 --> 1:57:18.720]  it's not just people panic buying i think more lockdowns are coming because they are uh it's
[1:57:18.720 --> 1:57:22.080]  it's because the supply chains are breaking down i know that's hitting you all i know it's rough
[1:57:22.800 --> 1:57:26.320]  and so that's why we got to come together as families you know no shame in moving in with
[1:57:26.320 --> 1:57:29.760]  your parents or moving in with your kids or whatever you all got to huddle together now
[1:57:29.760 --> 1:57:34.480]  support each other and not support the big globalist corporations all right we got a very special
[1:57:34.480 --> 1:57:39.680]  guest in a testimony that's going to save a lot of lives and we got the news of the election
[1:57:40.320 --> 1:57:46.080]  and them panicking and what's going to be coming out next and so much more we'll be right back
[1:57:46.080 --> 1:57:56.640]  with hour number three i'm uh uh 59 years old in good health i'm not working in the front line
[1:57:56.640 --> 1:58:05.600]  and so i'm my time is not recommended to be a vaccination that was the current ceo of fizer
[1:58:06.320 --> 1:58:13.920]  just a few months ago on national tv interviews saying oh he doesn't need to take the so-called
[1:58:13.920 --> 1:58:19.600]  m r and a maxi that's really a gene therapy he said you know he's 57 years old he's healthy he
[1:58:19.600 --> 1:58:25.120]  doesn't need it it's at risk people but that's not what is br firms that have bought off the
[1:58:25.120 --> 1:58:29.440]  politicians over a hundred countries say they say you've got to take it to have a job or leave
[1:58:29.440 --> 1:58:35.040]  your house or get on a plane or a train or even get outside your home for one hour a day if you
[1:58:35.040 --> 1:58:40.560]  live in australia so remember the white house this exempt congress and their staff are exempt
[1:58:40.560 --> 1:58:44.880]  the postal service is exempt all these big corporate heads are exempt they're not taking
[1:58:44.880 --> 1:58:49.200]  their poison vaccine they're pushing it on you wake up folks wake up
[1:58:49.200 --> 1:58:54.000]  when bob woodward's new book came out
[1:58:54.720 --> 1:58:58.880]  alleging that general milley had called the head of the chinese military and said trump might
[1:58:58.880 --> 1:59:03.840]  nuke you he tried to overthrow the u.s. government but basically i'm protecting you and i'll warn
[1:59:03.840 --> 1:59:08.720]  you if we launch an attack which was the greatest reason u.s. history that has ever been committed
[1:59:09.280 --> 1:59:13.360]  people said oh alex it must not be true and i might wait bob woodward's former naval intelligence
[1:59:13.360 --> 1:59:18.080]  he's a big insider globalist he wouldn't have put this out unless they wanted to put it out
[1:59:18.080 --> 1:59:22.640]  say that billy was a hero to set the precedent that you can have a permanent bureaucracy stay
[1:59:22.640 --> 1:59:27.040]  behind network deep state basically that has its own bureaucratic coup over america that's
[1:59:27.040 --> 1:59:31.040]  where they put bite in he's so incredibly weak he's to undermine the idea of the presidency
[1:59:31.040 --> 1:59:35.840]  well people said i was making it up with bob woodward's line well now milley admits he did it
[1:59:35.840 --> 1:59:40.640]  you see i didn't need to trust bob woodward i remember polosi on january eight ragging
[1:59:40.640 --> 1:59:44.400]  that she'd gotten a call from milley that he'd taken control of the nukes so this treason was
[1:59:44.400 --> 1:59:48.880]  hiding in plain view back then and we covered it see i have a memory folks i remember all this
[1:59:48.880 --> 2:00:15.600]  stuff that's why i know it's true and what's false you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:00:15.600 --> 2:00:20.720]  by new through friday at eight a.m harris is spent in american journal knocks it out of the park
[2:00:20.720 --> 2:00:26.560]  and i go live at 11 a.m central three p.m then a nice big dose of freedom with amazing guests
[2:00:26.560 --> 2:00:32.240]  and research with oan shroyer three to six p.m central and i do a lot of new live shows weekend
[2:00:32.240 --> 2:00:37.760]  shows i'm gonna start a podcast soon three days a week that's basically commercial free i'll have
[2:00:37.760 --> 2:00:42.640]  a few breaks in it uh some of it's gonna be a live podcast something a lot of people don't do
[2:00:42.640 --> 2:00:48.480]  just like this live radio slash tv show that's all coming up we're going to be joined by a lady who
[2:00:49.280 --> 2:00:55.840]  has quite a testimony to tell coming up next segment kimberley fletcher of moms for trump
[2:00:55.840 --> 2:01:00.960]  dot us but i want to go to this report to remember that they're trying to glaze over the fact that
[2:01:00.960 --> 2:01:06.640]  it's confirmed that peter dazzic and fousy created the bio weapon that is covered 19 here's the report
[2:01:06.640 --> 2:01:15.920]  that's have a higher proportion of zoonotic viruses than any other group when you correct for
[2:01:15.920 --> 2:01:21.200]  all the underlying biases in literature so they really are a risky group the peter dazzic eco health
[2:01:21.200 --> 2:01:27.040]  alliance ruse is disintegrating after the smoking gun was discovered in fact the chairman of the
[2:01:27.040 --> 2:01:34.720]  lancet covet 19 origins task force tied to peter dazzic and eco health alliance just disbanded
[2:01:34.720 --> 2:01:39.760]  don't learn about the eco health alliance what is it well we're a we're a nonprofit a typical
[2:01:40.560 --> 2:01:48.640]  charity 501 c3 in the u.s. funded by federal government and other sources but then try and
[2:01:48.640 --> 2:01:52.240]  take the size and do something with it on the ground so that's the charity side that's that
[2:01:52.240 --> 2:01:58.240]  that's a 501 c3 side of it but will congress properly address it without it just becoming a
[2:01:58.240 --> 2:02:05.440]  debate on the national stage between the scientific jargon of researchers and if so will they be able
[2:02:05.440 --> 2:02:12.400]  to explain it to the rest of the world in layman's terms or will it just remain in the groundbreaking
[2:02:12.400 --> 2:02:20.080]  intercept article quietly reimagining the origins of covet 19 in 2018 a proposal was rejected by the
[2:02:20.080 --> 2:02:26.640]  u.s. military research agency from peter dazzic president of the nonprofit eco health alliance
[2:02:26.640 --> 2:02:34.000]  the proposal described the insertion of human specific cleavage sites into sars related bat
[2:02:34.000 --> 2:02:42.160]  coronaviruses essentially dazzic had proposed the research of a radical new way for sars related
[2:02:42.160 --> 2:02:49.200]  coronavirus to be transmitted to human beings via what is known as the furan cleavage site
[2:02:49.200 --> 2:02:56.160]  weaponizing the virus to more efficiently bind to and release its genetic material into human
[2:02:56.160 --> 2:03:01.600]  cells do you do that you've got in the field yeah i still i still do i i i have two countries that
[2:03:01.600 --> 2:03:09.200]  are still kind of i'm in charge of in in the organization china and malaysia you're saying
[2:03:09.200 --> 2:03:14.640]  these are diverse coronaviruses and you can't vaccinate against them there are no antivirals
[2:03:14.640 --> 2:03:19.920]  what what do we what do we do well i so i i think that coronaviruses are pretty good i mean your
[2:03:19.920 --> 2:03:25.200]  apologies you know all this stuff but they you can manipulate them in the lab pretty easily it's just
[2:03:25.200 --> 2:03:30.880]  spike protein drives a lot of what happens with the coronavirus uh zoonotic risk so you can get
[2:03:30.880 --> 2:03:35.920]  the sequence you can build the protein and we work with Ralph barrack at u n c to do this and

[2:03:42.320 --> 2:03:48.080]  more predictive when you find a sequence you've got this diversity again darpa rejected the proposal
[2:03:48.080 --> 2:03:55.120]  yet two years later dazak's proposal appears in what we now know as kovat 19 which originated
[2:03:55.120 --> 2:04:02.000]  from the vicinity of the wuhan lab in china where the eco health alliance sars research continued
[2:04:02.000 --> 2:04:08.400]  furthermore this odd new feature that dazak had previously proposed on the spike protein of the
[2:04:08.400 --> 2:04:16.160]  virus had never been seen in sars related beta coronaviruses the class to which sars kov2 the
[2:04:16.160 --> 2:04:23.360]  coronavirus that causes the respiratory illness kovat 19 belongs further layman's terms there is
[2:04:23.360 --> 2:04:30.080]  now plenty of evidence that dazak may have laid out a method by which to commit mass murder with a

[2:06:16.880 --> 2:06:29.920]  ladies and gentlemen we are back and now into our number three i'm your host alex jones and
[2:06:29.920 --> 2:06:35.840]  kimberley fletcher of moms for america dot us is joining us i was familiar with her group
[2:06:35.840 --> 2:06:41.120]  reaching millions of people but then a mutual friend of ours contacted us a few weeks ago
[2:06:41.120 --> 2:06:47.760]  and they said listen she's really really sick uh and she can't get me help the regular doctors
[2:06:47.760 --> 2:06:50.880]  won't help her so we put her in touch with the texas doctor that helped me and my family
[2:06:51.840 --> 2:06:59.120]  with the hydroxychloroquine with the different things like the budesodine uh with the ivermectin
[2:06:59.120 --> 2:07:04.240]  and my dad was like like 82 83 oxygen couldn't get up he had gone to the hospital that
[2:07:04.240 --> 2:07:10.240]  animated me to die the next day he was up putting together lawn furniture that he'd gotten delivered
[2:07:10.240 --> 2:07:14.480]  in boxes that wasn't put together yet his mind was gone for about a week after that but you know
[2:07:14.480 --> 2:07:20.640]  he's he's basically bounced back now but physically it was just dramatic and they're trying to suppress
[2:07:20.640 --> 2:07:26.880]  that now that uh regenerant is helping so many and it's even approved for covid uh biden's been
[2:07:26.880 --> 2:07:32.480]  trying to ration that from the from the red states uh and so we sent up a crew member to dallas from
[2:07:32.480 --> 2:07:37.920]  austin to give her and her husband the uh medicine because the doctors wouldn't wouldn't give her the
[2:07:37.920 --> 2:07:44.400]  prescription the medical doctor gave her and within a day we called to see how she was and she was
[2:07:44.400 --> 2:07:49.120]  already back on the road so she's here to tell that story i appreciate her to tell that story
[2:07:49.120 --> 2:07:52.640]  because people need to hear there's not just the studies they're suppressing about the stuff
[2:07:52.640 --> 2:07:57.600]  the desinine and the rest of it it's that and the fake stories they're putting out about it
[2:07:57.600 --> 2:08:01.680]  we're oh the hospitals are full of people and ivermectin none of that was true it was all fake
[2:08:02.720 --> 2:08:07.680]  it it's that it's the anecdotal evidence that i experienced with a lot of my crew and my family
[2:08:07.680 --> 2:08:13.680]  and myself and my wife uh so it's it's it's really important we get this out so people know so
[2:08:13.680 --> 2:08:21.600]  Kimberly Fletcher uh again from moms4america.us and uh joining us thanks for coming on thank you
[2:08:21.600 --> 2:08:27.040]  for having me i am really excited to actually tell this story more moms more families need to know
[2:08:27.040 --> 2:08:32.320]  about this what there is out there that can help support them absolutely so let's just start at
[2:08:32.320 --> 2:08:36.800]  the beginning because a lot of people last year the statistics were covid was overblown
[2:08:36.800 --> 2:08:40.800]  and they were people that died in car wrecks or gunshot wounds they were saying was that people
[2:08:40.800 --> 2:08:45.520]  with three types of cancer they were saying was covid but then this year i told people about five
[2:08:45.520 --> 2:08:50.080]  months ago hey real stuff's going around this is serious and then i experienced it two months ago
[2:08:50.080 --> 2:08:56.000]  you experienced it a few weeks ago not like the flu not like a cold uh you know worst thing i've
[2:08:56.000 --> 2:09:00.400]  ever been hit with and and i'm pretty tough almost killed my dad describe what happened to you
[2:09:00.400 --> 2:09:07.920]  so first of all i did not know that i had covid for several days and the and the reason why i
[2:09:07.920 --> 2:09:13.440]  didn't even consider that i had covid is because i took the test last march and it came back negative
[2:09:13.440 --> 2:09:17.200]  the first time but then they said we want you to come back and take it again so i went back
[2:09:17.200 --> 2:09:21.760]  and took it again and they said it was positive and i had you know flu symptoms and i think i
[2:09:21.760 --> 2:09:27.440]  had the flu there's no way in heck i had covid last year and so when i started to get sick this
[2:09:27.440 --> 2:09:32.880]  year immediately started with a high fever and chills and body aches and i thought oh i'm getting
[2:09:32.880 --> 2:09:42.800]  something and so i came home and um i rested and i um actually okay because so many people so many
[2:09:42.800 --> 2:09:48.400]  of my friends have been telling me um you you've got to take this seriously i thought okay just on
[2:09:48.400 --> 2:09:55.440]  the chance that maybe it's covid but i was pretty sure it wasn't um i contacted a local friend here
[2:09:55.440 --> 2:10:01.600]  in nebraska on the way home um i stopped at her house and she gave me high hydroxychloroquine
[2:10:01.600 --> 2:10:07.360]  but i only had three days worth so i took it for those three days and i was like doing pretty well
[2:10:07.360 --> 2:10:11.680]  i'm like okay i don't know what that was but obviously wasn't covid and so i just went on you
[2:10:11.680 --> 2:10:18.000]  know with my life and my daughter was with me and we made it um we went to nashville and had
[2:10:18.000 --> 2:10:24.640]  some events there and we started to get really sick and i'm like okay we we got to get home
[2:10:24.640 --> 2:10:31.360]  and um we had a flight to dalis so i said okay let's let's get the flight to dalis um i i think
[2:10:31.360 --> 2:10:36.720]  we've got the flu we we we we were wearing masks and for the first time didn't mind and we're like
[2:10:36.720 --> 2:10:41.600]  okay we're we just got to get home and so we got to dalis and we couldn't make it any further
[2:10:42.240 --> 2:10:48.560]  we um my daughter when she got off the plane could not breathe and she already has asthma
[2:10:48.560 --> 2:10:54.960]  and so we were um i was very concerned and i said don't even don't even tell me where the hotel is
[2:10:54.960 --> 2:11:01.200]  just get me to a hospital and i was adamantly adamantly opposed to hospitals because of everything
[2:11:01.200 --> 2:11:04.960]  that i've been hearing you go in there and they give you a disavvier put you on a ventilator
[2:11:04.960 --> 2:11:09.520]  and and you're either there for weeks or you die and i'm like i can't we can't go there they're
[2:11:09.520 --> 2:11:17.040]  they're not going to treat us and but a god thing um she put an emergency room not hospital
[2:11:17.040 --> 2:11:23.440]  and it sent us to a 24-hour ER clinic and when we got there um my daughter was it with when she
[2:11:23.440 --> 2:11:28.080]  her symptoms first started she was within the 10-day window and so they put her on Regeneron
[2:11:28.080 --> 2:11:33.440]  but i wouldn't let them give her anything until i understood what it was they were doing so i have a
[2:11:33.440 --> 2:11:38.720]  one of our moms is a nurse practitioner in florida and so i'm sitting there texting her while the
[2:11:38.720 --> 2:11:43.840]  doctor's trying to tell me what my daughter needs and i said they want to give her this this
[2:11:43.840 --> 2:11:49.360]  antibody IV thing what what is that and she said is it Regeneron and i asked the doctor and the
[2:11:49.360 --> 2:11:53.840]  doctor said yes and she said take it and i'm like okay so i'm just trying to get the best
[2:11:53.840 --> 2:11:59.200]  information i can in an emergency situation so we both tested positive for COVID they gave my
[2:11:59.200 --> 2:12:05.280]  daughter Regeneron and then they said you're outside the window of of where when it works but
[2:12:06.000 --> 2:12:09.840]  we're gonna we you're like right on the edge so we're going to go ahead and try it anyway and
[2:12:09.840 --> 2:12:17.600]  i'm like okay um so we were able to get back to the hotel and we just slept all night long and um
[2:12:17.600 --> 2:12:21.760]  it was the first time in days that we'd been able to really sleep and then the next morning
[2:12:22.400 --> 2:12:28.880]  oh my gosh we were so so sick and there are all kinds of of symptoms of COVID people don't
[2:12:28.880 --> 2:12:33.280]  i was about to say it's when you lay down and sleep that it really gets you of it but continues
[2:12:33.280 --> 2:12:41.120]  yeah and i had no idea so we get up the next morning and we it's i can't even explain it
[2:12:41.120 --> 2:12:45.920]  it's it's like you're not inside your body like your your body's out there doing its thing and
[2:12:45.920 --> 2:12:49.840]  you're like where is my brain and and when i was explaining to people i said the only way i can
[2:12:49.840 --> 2:12:54.400]  explain it is it's like being on a merry-go-round non-stop and you can't get off and you're you're
[2:12:54.400 --> 2:12:59.440]  dizzy you're disoriented we were nauseous we were vomiting we had diarrhea all kinds of things they
[2:12:59.440 --> 2:13:05.200]  don't say anything about COVID that didn't sound like the flu and we never had sore throats we we
[2:13:05.200 --> 2:13:12.160]  were running fevers that would not go away and and so the the night before um i called my husband
[2:13:12.160 --> 2:13:17.600]  and i said we got to figure something out we got to get home we can't get on a plane and so he said
[2:13:17.600 --> 2:13:22.800]  we decided that the best thing was for him to just drive down and then drive us back home
[2:13:22.800 --> 2:13:28.320]  so when he came down he came in the room and and all the lights were off and we're in bed going
[2:13:28.320 --> 2:13:33.520]  uh you know and he's like oh my gosh it's like a tomb in here what is wrong with you and i'm like
[2:13:33.520 --> 2:13:37.680]  i mean we're gonna have to go to the hospital i don't i i don't want to go to the hospital but i
[2:13:37.680 --> 2:13:42.080]  don't know what to do i can't breathe as he can't breathe she was taking albuterol because she has
[2:13:42.080 --> 2:13:49.040]  asthma but it wasn't helping and we just we were in a very very bad place and um my friend had
[2:13:49.040 --> 2:13:54.640]  texted me right around that time and i had texted her a few days earlier before i realized i was sick
[2:13:54.640 --> 2:13:59.280]  and asked her a question and and so she was responding back to me and i said i i'm i'm so
[2:13:59.280 --> 2:14:06.480]  sorry i i i can't i can't talk right now julie i i um i am i got covid and i'm really sick
[2:14:07.600 --> 2:14:13.040]  she went crazy she was like oh my gosh what are your symptoms and so i started telling her and
[2:14:13.040 --> 2:14:16.720]  she said i know exactly what you need and she mentioned ivermectin i've never even heard of
[2:14:16.720 --> 2:14:22.320]  ivermectin why why have i not heard of ivermectin if that's something that's that's treating people
[2:14:22.320 --> 2:14:26.480]  and it's successfully treating people with covid why is that not all over the place
[2:14:26.480 --> 2:14:31.520]  and then she was telling me about bridesadine and and and all these things and i'm i can't even think
[2:14:31.520 --> 2:14:35.280]  straight and and she said we need to get you medicine we need to get you medicine right now
[2:14:36.160 --> 2:14:41.040]  next thing i know one of your awesome guys is driving up from austin and bringing us a bag of
[2:14:41.040 --> 2:14:47.280]  all the medications we need and we were able to get um because of you guys thank god we were able

[2:19:09.840 --> 2:19:13.680]  of that group so he didn't stand up and then when they came for another group he wasn't part of that
[2:19:13.680 --> 2:19:19.200]  group so he didn't stand up and finally when they came for him there was nobody else to stand up
[2:19:19.200 --> 2:19:23.280]  well the global social credit score that china is putting in that's banning people to three hours of
[2:19:23.280 --> 2:19:28.240]  video games a week and if you criticize the government you can never buy or sell again well
[2:19:28.240 --> 2:19:33.200]  that's that's being brought here and all over the world under the guise of covid vaccine passports
[2:19:33.200 --> 2:19:37.360]  they even admit it now there's going to be a carbon tax attached to it they're going to track
[2:19:37.360 --> 2:19:42.160]  where you go what you do and decide where you can go and what you can do that's what the lockdowns
[2:19:42.160 --> 2:19:48.000]  are about you'll accept that you'll accept anything so again the leftist having fun right now with
[2:19:48.000 --> 2:19:51.840]  all the censorship and tyranny pretending like they're part of the power structure but they're
[2:19:51.840 --> 2:19:55.680]  all going to be targeted by this nightmare as well we need to get back to basic human rights and
[2:19:55.680 --> 2:20:00.240]  promote them or all of us will be enslaved by this horrible technocracy run by the globalists
[2:20:00.240 --> 2:20:17.840]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:20:22.400 --> 2:20:27.200]  kebert lee fletcher of moms for america dot us is our guest and she's reached millions of millions
[2:20:27.200 --> 2:20:31.200]  of people one of the biggest groups out there really energizing the trump campaign we're glad
[2:20:31.200 --> 2:20:36.240]  she didn't die we're glad her daughter didn't die uh and again we have a mutual friend julie
[2:20:36.240 --> 2:20:41.280]  we won't say her last name uh and she called us and and i knew at first we called in and had a
[2:20:41.280 --> 2:20:46.320]  doctor calling in from texas but then the pharmacy wouldn't do it so then we went ahead and got um
[2:20:46.320 --> 2:20:49.520]  one of my crew members volunteered to drive up to dallas because he's he'd had it and seen the
[2:20:49.520 --> 2:20:55.600]  devastation and and seen what the drugs that dr uh Bartlett put us on did very quickly for him
[2:20:55.600 --> 2:20:58.320]  and then by the time they got there they got another doctor so they could get the other
[2:20:58.320 --> 2:21:03.280]  prescription they needed and again she's saying within five six hours dramatic you got cut off
[2:21:03.280 --> 2:21:07.040]  by the break lay out what it was like because exactly what you described is what you're like
[2:21:07.040 --> 2:21:12.960]  out of your body you're dizzy you can't breathe and then personally for myself within about five
[2:21:12.960 --> 2:21:19.600]  six hours of the avermectin and the redesidine i felt about 50 percent better uh but i waited so
[2:21:19.600 --> 2:21:23.600]  long to get on and i i probably had it four or five days before i went and got tested and figured
[2:21:23.600 --> 2:21:28.800]  out and so then the crystals the prions already done some damage but i was i went from not being
[2:21:28.800 --> 2:21:32.800]  able to breathe in a day out of just being uncomfortable with three or four more days and
[2:21:32.800 --> 2:21:37.120]  again that's because i waited you know uh long into it but please continue with what happened
[2:21:37.120 --> 2:21:43.280]  to you and your daughter yeah so it literally was like night and day and and i i know it sounds
[2:21:43.280 --> 2:21:49.200]  crazy and that's the reason why i want everybody to know and i'm i'm on a mission now to make sure
[2:21:49.200 --> 2:21:53.840]  that every family out there knows that there is a way to treat this especially moms because moms
[2:21:53.840 --> 2:21:58.880]  are very concerned and they're actually considering giving their children a vaccine and i'm like no
[2:21:58.880 --> 2:22:03.680]  there is a treatment and your children are gonna be fine but why would they not do this and that's
[2:22:03.680 --> 2:22:11.520]  why i kept questioning so so my daughter and i when when we went into the clinic um i i thought
[2:22:11.520 --> 2:22:17.360]  they'll do something that that will take care of us and once we got the the medication and it was
[2:22:17.360 --> 2:22:23.920]  like it was like night and day i i could not figure out why why would they not just prescribe that
[2:22:23.920 --> 2:22:29.040]  and so when we got the prescription for dr Bartlett for the for the remaining medication we needed
[2:22:29.760 --> 2:22:35.520]  the pharmacies wouldn't fill it and so we had to go we went to palmer pharmacy in dallas texas
[2:22:35.520 --> 2:22:41.200]  and they filled it god love them um wall greens wouldn't fill it cbs wouldn't fill it and wall
[2:22:41.200 --> 2:22:46.240]  green said because that's where we're my husband's prior military and we had military insurance
[2:22:46.240 --> 2:22:51.280]  and so when we went in and when he went to get the medication for us um they said we would have to
[2:22:51.280 --> 2:22:57.120]  the doctor would have to fill out this form to explain why it was he was prescribing this
[2:22:57.120 --> 2:23:02.560]  medication if we wanted the insurance to pay for it and i said well pay cash thank you i'm like
[2:23:02.560 --> 2:23:07.280]  that's crazy well just pay for just give me the day but still they wouldn't because they're ordered
[2:23:07.280 --> 2:23:12.880]  not to buy fouchy and even when the scientists say give it to people which the NIH others are saying
[2:23:12.880 --> 2:23:19.200]  fouchy says no fizer says no who made fouchy and the ceo of fizer in control of our lives because
[2:23:19.200 --> 2:23:23.440]  again they're killing a lot of people suppressing this just like the ivermectin just like the
[2:23:23.440 --> 2:23:28.080]  hydroxychloroquine just like the vitamin d just like the zinc just like they're trying to block
[2:23:28.080 --> 2:23:36.560]  regeneron right now right so i i hear that it's really interesting thing is um i i could not
[2:23:36.560 --> 2:23:42.960]  remember the name of the the iv medication that they gave my daughter and i and so i called the clinic
[2:23:42.960 --> 2:23:47.200]  to get the name of it because i wanted to make sure i i had that because i was like well if that
[2:23:47.200 --> 2:23:51.360]  made a difference i want to make sure this is on here and so i called the clinic and they
[2:23:51.360 --> 2:23:58.160]  sent me back to the doctor who was on the floor and um as as she was looking up what what it was
[2:23:58.160 --> 2:24:03.440]  what the treatment was that they that they gave me she said so i how are you doing are you still
[2:24:03.440 --> 2:24:09.520]  sick are you getting better and i said oh my gosh i am so much better i i got ivermectin and it
[2:24:09.520 --> 2:24:16.480]  changed everything and she hung up on me and i was like what so i called back because i still
[2:24:16.480 --> 2:24:23.040]  didn't have the name of the of the medication she gave me and so um i said what you know why would
[2:24:23.040 --> 2:24:28.080]  why did you hang up on me and and she said well that's not an approved medication and i said well
[2:24:28.080 --> 2:24:31.840]  neither is the vaccine you guys are shoving down our throats but you want us to take that
[2:24:31.840 --> 2:24:38.880]  and she hung up on me again and so i was like wow why do these people not want to know because they
[2:24:38.880 --> 2:24:44.080]  made medicine political science and medicine was always about asking questions it was always about
[2:24:44.080 --> 2:24:48.320]  doctors finding out what works doesn't work that's how most medications were discovered was by just
[2:24:48.320 --> 2:24:53.440]  random it's well known that ivermectin is antiviral it's well known that hydroxychloroquine is
[2:24:53.440 --> 2:24:59.200]  antiviral it's well known vitamin d is antiviral it's well known that's why they used to put uh
[2:24:59.200 --> 2:25:04.160]  you know in the gin they used to put a naturally occurring chemicals in there that were known to
[2:25:04.160 --> 2:25:09.040]  keep people from getting malaria so so so they've been and that's the same chemical that is in
[2:25:09.040 --> 2:25:15.200]  the hydroxychloroquine so they've been doing this over and over and over again and it's absolutely
[2:25:15.200 --> 2:25:20.000]  disgusting i even saw articles 20 months ago when it was first coming out that the same stuff in
[2:25:20.000 --> 2:25:26.400]  tonic is the same stuff in in uh hydroxychloroquine they were trying to block that at some big
[2:25:26.400 --> 2:25:30.720]  wholesale supply saying don't give it to people if they say it's for that so you can drink it with
[2:25:30.720 --> 2:25:36.800]  vodka you can drink it with gin but you can't have it gin and tonic well the tonic is known as
[2:25:36.800 --> 2:25:42.240]  an old name for a medicine and again it's the same chemical that is in the hydroxychloroquine so
[2:25:42.240 --> 2:25:48.960]  this is the conscious suppression of known treatments in its criminal well and it is really
[2:25:49.600 --> 2:25:54.560]  infuriated me because we hear from moms all the time who are concerned about all kinds of issues
[2:25:54.560 --> 2:26:00.160]  that that you address on the show and we can't even answer questions because social media shuts
[2:26:00.160 --> 2:26:04.880]  you down that goes against their standards so moms are out there hungering for information and
[2:26:04.880 --> 2:26:12.720]  truth and the whole entire medical industry has has turned into this this weaponized political
[2:26:12.720 --> 2:26:17.600]  i don't even understand why american medical association is telling doctors what they're
[2:26:17.600 --> 2:26:22.560]  supposed to say and what they're not supposed to say when i looked at my at my records from
[2:26:22.560 --> 2:26:29.280]  from when i was at the clinic it said there is no medicine to treat the virus that is a bold
[2:26:29.280 --> 2:26:35.040]  faced lie why are they telling people that they told me immediately big bold like all capital
[2:26:35.040 --> 2:26:40.480]  letters stop taking hydroxychloroquine well i'd been out by then so but i told them i'd take
[2:26:40.480 --> 2:26:44.560]  an hydroxychloroquine and then would you take the vaccine no i didn't take the vaccine i have no
[2:26:44.560 --> 2:26:49.840]  idea what's in that vaccine and they there's just certain things that they're going to push at you
[2:26:49.840 --> 2:26:54.880]  and and you go to these doctors and the in these medical professionals because you trust them and
[2:26:54.880 --> 2:27:01.920]  you're looking for information and and they are not giving it and it is that just literally
[2:27:01.920 --> 2:27:07.120]  infuriates me and so i want to i'm going to get this out i'll create videos i'll go on any media
[2:27:07.120 --> 2:27:13.120]  source and i'll tell people listen we're being lied to and and we as moms if no one else is
[2:27:13.120 --> 2:27:16.720]  going to handle this and take care of this right we as moms are going to make sure that other moms
[2:27:16.720 --> 2:27:22.000]  know so that our children our families our parents are taken care of ivermectin saves lives
[2:27:22.000 --> 2:27:27.840]  it saved my life it saved my daughter's life and now i have a whole bunch of it in my house
[2:27:27.840 --> 2:27:33.840]  in case any of my other family members get it my husband got it we have him on on on everything
[2:27:33.840 --> 2:27:40.400]  so we have to make sure that we are taking care of ourselves if the media is going to lie to us
[2:27:40.400 --> 2:27:45.680]  if dr. Fauci is going to turn this into a political issue then my goal is to take the politics out
[2:27:45.680 --> 2:27:50.720]  of things that should not be political and make this about what really does make a difference
[2:27:50.720 --> 2:27:56.800]  and we should start with what what works to treat people with covid and start telling the truth
[2:27:56.800 --> 2:28:03.280]  there are treatments they are out there i was very blessed and and lucky because i had friends
[2:28:03.280 --> 2:28:07.280]  and a great support team that when they found out they were able to help me what about everybody
[2:28:07.280 --> 2:28:13.840]  else we've got to get this information out as far and wide as we can you're right it's a life and
[2:28:13.840 --> 2:28:18.800]  death situation then you find out that big pharma and big media and big tech are together when senator
[2:28:18.800 --> 2:28:22.800]  paul comes out and says natural immunity is way better than than the immunity for the vaccine
[2:28:22.800 --> 2:28:28.080]  they censor it saying the un doesn't allow that when a young man in college has a heart attack
[2:28:28.080 --> 2:28:32.240]  because the vaccine they say well he told the truth but still we're going to censor his post
[2:28:32.240 --> 2:28:37.760]  he might scare people that is tyranny and fouching and others know what they're doing it is extremely
[2:28:37.760 --> 2:28:41.840]  criminal i want to spend a few more minutes with kimberley fletcher of moms for america dot us
[2:28:41.840 --> 2:28:46.960]  about her view on trump uh the election where she sees all this going and more but what she's
[2:28:46.960 --> 2:28:52.080]  saying is absolutely on target we have to warn others when we learn that there are amazing
[2:28:52.080 --> 2:28:56.640]  treatments for this uh and that they are suppressing them by the way i've talked to physicians
[2:28:56.640 --> 2:29:00.800]  that are treating google executives they're all on ivermectin as well if you're concerned about
[2:29:00.800 --> 2:29:05.840]  the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid electricity this will be the
[2:29:05.840 --> 2:29:11.360]  most important message you'll hear this year here's why we now have a small number of solar
[2:29:11.360 --> 2:29:17.360]  generators back in stock these emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you
[2:29:17.360 --> 2:29:23.600]  need it most and unlike gas generators solar generators run quietly emit no dangerous fumes
[2:29:23.600 --> 2:29:29.040]  and produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun whether it's wildfires dangerous
[2:29:29.040 --> 2:29:33.840]  whether power grid issues or just getting off the grid you'll never have to suffer through
[2:29:33.840 --> 2:29:39.920]  painful power outages again even better all this week radio listeners get over seven hundred dollars
[2:29:39.920 --> 2:29:46.080]  in free off-the-grid bonuses too go to my solar backup dot com to learn more and check availability
[2:29:46.080 --> 2:29:51.760]  that's my solar backup dot com look for the free report crisis cooling how to make absolutely sure
[2:29:51.760 --> 2:29:58.480]  your meat milk and medicines stay safe and cool in any power outage yours free at my solar backup
[2:29:58.480 --> 2:30:07.920]  dot com so the placebo that they have used that the fda has allowed them to use has often been
[2:30:07.920 --> 2:30:13.840]  another vaccine a vaccine with a known adverse reaction profile that's causing death and damage
[2:30:13.840 --> 2:30:21.840]  in its own right that it's the aluminum as an adjuvant in the vaccine a known neurotoxin a
[2:30:21.840 --> 2:30:28.640]  known immunotoxin a known poison in human beings that is in the supposedly inert placebo totally
[2:30:28.640 --> 2:30:36.000]  inappropriate this is not good science it is not science at all it is an effort to cover up the
[2:30:36.000 --> 2:30:42.480]  true adverse reaction rates to these vaccines so that they can get through the low barrier of
[2:30:42.480 --> 2:30:48.240]  constraints put there by the fda and onto the market that is the only concern dr wakefield is
[2:30:48.240 --> 2:30:53.760]  just one of many informed voices in the film covet land secure your copy of cobaland today
[2:30:53.760 --> 2:30:59.040]  and cobaland dot com and if you order by october 6 you get a free copy of the film blueprint for
[2:30:59.040 --> 2:31:05.200]  global enslavement absolutely free around the world the general public has woken up the fact
[2:31:05.200 --> 2:31:13.360]  that this isn't a left or right issue this is a global corporate a 10 to 21 to 20 30 great reset
[2:31:13.360 --> 2:31:20.960]  takeover this is a technocracy but very few leaders or bond balsamaro just a few others
[2:31:20.960 --> 2:31:27.920]  are addressing it for what it is to their people a foreign anti-human anti-family anti-god
[2:31:28.640 --> 2:31:34.720]  takeover of the very biological system of humans this is a corporate takeover of our bodies of
[2:31:34.720 --> 2:31:39.760]  ourselves with the world ID the medical tracking system that will be tied to the carbon taxes it's
[2:31:39.760 --> 2:31:46.240]  all been announced it is a dystopic nightmare and humanity is starting to organize but our leaders
[2:31:46.240 --> 2:31:51.920]  aren't we need senator paul and senator holly and others that have shown some understanding of this
[2:31:51.920 --> 2:31:57.840]  and senator cruz to organize against this foreign multinational corporate takeovers or big pharma
[2:31:57.840 --> 2:32:05.840]  big banks and big tech or we have no hope i have the greatest sense of loss deep in my heart even
[2:32:05.840 --> 2:32:13.280]  my soul had ever had in my 47 years on this planet i've had a lot of loss everybody else has and
[2:32:13.280 --> 2:32:24.000]  it's because it's a loss of ancestral freedom that so many people fought and died and bled and
[2:32:24.000 --> 2:32:32.720]  sweat for and now we're just throwing it all away and i see the general public in a medically induced
[2:32:32.720 --> 2:32:40.240]  scientifically induced behavioral psychologically controlled trans and i know we're being fed into
[2:32:40.240 --> 2:32:47.200]  this globalist meat grinder and it's so incredibly sad but this is the process of birth and then
[2:32:47.200 --> 2:32:52.480]  growth and then falling apart and then you get already collapsing and then coming back to life
[2:32:52.480 --> 2:32:57.680]  again it's just the globalists are actively trying to steer and control this process of
[2:32:57.680 --> 2:33:08.400]  decadence and collapse to actually end the species as we know it you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:33:08.400 --> 2:33:10.400]  you
[2:33:21.520 --> 2:33:27.840]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[2:33:27.840 --> 2:33:38.560]  well here is the national health minister saying it's a permanent lockdown in australia
[2:33:38.560 --> 2:33:43.520]  and that you'll have to take shots all the time the ceo feiser said it will all end except for those
[2:33:43.520 --> 2:33:47.680]  that aren't inoculated you will not be able to quote live your life because he said you'll have to
[2:33:47.680 --> 2:33:53.360]  have these shots to live your life that's called being held hostage uh biden just got his quote
[2:33:53.360 --> 2:33:57.920]  third shot and i guess it'll be his fourth this fifth this tenth this 20th and uh you know here
[2:33:57.920 --> 2:34:03.360]  he is supposedly getting protected when israel did the booster shots two months ago and found
[2:34:03.360 --> 2:34:09.760]  that gave you quote 48 hours of more protection so it'll be like an aspirin soon you'll get four
[2:34:09.760 --> 2:34:15.440]  hours of protection i mean they say oh trust the science but then oh don't look at the science
[2:34:15.440 --> 2:34:19.120]  don't go down the rabbit hole you're not smart enough to be able to figure this out yourself
[2:34:19.120 --> 2:34:25.840]  here is again a clip of the australian health minister shady shady lady and then we've got
[2:34:25.840 --> 2:34:32.800]  to the head of feiser making the new announcement as well stress we will not be ever have to go
[2:34:32.800 --> 2:34:38.640]  back to pre-covid levels we're always going to have to be mindful that covid exists we're going
[2:34:38.640 --> 2:34:44.080]  to have to engage with booster shots we're going to have to engage with advice from time to time
[2:34:44.080 --> 2:34:49.280]  when we see outbreaks we're going to have to respond so it's it's not going to go back to normal we
[2:34:49.280 --> 2:34:55.200]  can't deny that we're going to have to live with covid um but having those very high vaccination
[2:34:55.200 --> 2:35:02.160]  levels will allow us to have more minimal restrictions or more minimal um public health
[2:35:02.160 --> 2:35:07.760]  measures in place as we as we navigate the future year i agree that within a year i think we will be
[2:35:07.760 --> 2:35:13.360]  able to come back to normal life i don't think that this means that uh variants will not be
[2:35:13.360 --> 2:35:19.600]  continue coming and i don't think that this means that uh we should be able to to live our lives
[2:35:19.600 --> 2:35:26.720]  without having immune without having vaccinations basically but um that's again remains to to be
[2:35:26.720 --> 2:35:32.720]  seen the most likely scenario for me it is that because the virus is spread all over the world
[2:35:32.720 --> 2:35:38.400]  that we will continue seeing uh new variants that are coming out and also we will have uh
[2:35:38.400 --> 2:35:43.680]  vaccines that uh they will last at least a year and um i think the most likely scenario it is
[2:35:43.680 --> 2:35:49.920]  annual revaccination but we don't know if we need to wait and see the date dr burla thank you for
[2:35:49.920 --> 2:35:56.080]  your time this morning oh it was a great pleasure speaking to you george and uh we are sharing
[2:35:56.080 --> 2:36:02.000]  common heritage so it was yes we certainly do honor to talk to you and so now he's more powerful
[2:36:02.000 --> 2:36:06.240]  than bill gates they had a Pfizer tells you what you're going to do when you're going to do and
[2:36:06.240 --> 2:36:11.200]  oh did i seem less than at least a year but you get boosters as well uh and then you'll be allowed
[2:36:11.200 --> 2:36:16.320]  to maybe do a little bit of this a little bit of that oh we see the regulators say don't take booster
[2:36:16.320 --> 2:36:21.840]  don't give children it will happen then this weekend on the same show i am very pleased that
[2:36:21.840 --> 2:36:28.160]  they are overriding the scientists it's very good for our company who died and made this guy god
[2:36:28.160 --> 2:36:33.440]  while they control big tech and big media to block ivermectin and the rest of it and don't tell you
[2:36:33.440 --> 2:36:41.520]  that 84 percent of hospital admissions and deaths this is now a cdc study they put out last friday
[2:36:41.520 --> 2:36:46.560]  80 plus percent were vitamin d deficient oh but don't say that from the rooftops yeah if you don't
[2:36:46.560 --> 2:36:52.000]  have vitamin d any virus will kill you but notice oh there have been the variants of the cold oh this
[2:36:52.000 --> 2:36:57.600]  is our new life but the but kelvin is their own little creation of five viruses combined with an
[2:36:57.600 --> 2:37:02.160]  hiv delivery system so there's a real one out there where they can set the pcr test to whatever
[2:37:02.160 --> 2:37:08.560]  they want so kimberley fletcher i like your spirit in that you see what this is and you're
[2:37:08.560 --> 2:37:13.520]  saying they're trying to suppress us they can't suppress us if we all all go out and warn people
[2:37:13.520 --> 2:37:18.080]  and then find doctors that know the truth find pharmacies that know the truth and never again
[2:37:18.080 --> 2:37:22.240]  support the big pharmacies that wouldn't help you and your daughter when you were dying support
[2:37:22.240 --> 2:37:27.200]  that little pharmacy to live in another state find the local people and make them successful
[2:37:27.200 --> 2:37:31.680]  that's what america is all about we need to pull out of the establishment what do you say to that
[2:37:31.680 --> 2:37:38.160]  moms for america i'd say absolutely that's we are creating a landing page on our website and we
[2:37:38.160 --> 2:37:43.520]  hope to have done early next week and we're going to be saying exactly that thing if if these if
[2:37:43.520 --> 2:37:48.080]  these pharmacies are not filling the prescriptions call them out go to those local pharmacies let's
[2:37:48.080 --> 2:37:52.800]  help these small businesses who are standing up and doing the right thing i i think we need to
[2:37:52.800 --> 2:37:57.360]  start rewarding those organizations those individuals those entities those corporations
[2:37:57.360 --> 2:38:01.680]  that are doing the right thing because too many of them aren't and it really goes back to the local
[2:38:01.680 --> 2:38:07.920]  community and there's nothing more local than home and family and and right now families mothers
[2:38:07.920 --> 2:38:13.760]  particularly are struggling trying to find out what are the answers what is the truth where do
[2:38:13.760 --> 2:38:18.880]  we go to find these things so moms for america has become a trusted source that moms can come to
[2:38:18.880 --> 2:38:24.400]  and now we're going to be adding all of the information we're finding on coveted and i just
[2:38:24.400 --> 2:38:32.800]  but i try not to choke up here but um i just want to thank you because you and your team
[2:38:34.080 --> 2:38:42.320]  you saved our lives and and you've done it for somebody who has a lot of passion and so um this
[2:38:42.320 --> 2:38:46.960]  this story is not going to end and we're going to do everything that we can at moms for america
[2:38:46.960 --> 2:38:52.240]  to make sure that moms know about this and thank you for what you well listen please don't thank me
[2:38:52.240 --> 2:38:58.160]  because it's the same thing when i saw the statistics and the studies and knew that people that got on
[2:38:58.160 --> 2:39:02.160]  this early have like a hundred percent recovery rate the you know the combo the bedestidines
[2:39:02.160 --> 2:39:05.600]  very important as well and the zinc and all the rest of it but obviously i was the ivermectin
[2:39:05.600 --> 2:39:09.840]  incredible along with hydroxychloric and probably even better than hydroxychloric and but you get
[2:39:09.840 --> 2:39:14.400]  what you can get we're in this together this evil group wants to successfully kill us and
[2:39:14.400 --> 2:39:19.440]  control us it's a great victory every person we save so just like dr Bartlett literally has worked
[2:39:19.440 --> 2:39:23.760]  tirelessly through the night with so many other medical doctors at the risk of their own license
[2:39:23.760 --> 2:39:28.160]  you know they get persecuted to save lives but they didn't violate their hypocritic oath
[2:39:28.160 --> 2:39:32.400]  like these other people that don't just refuse to give you the medicine and the medical care
[2:39:32.400 --> 2:39:37.760]  they hate you because they deep down know you are right and dr Bartlett's right and the studies
[2:39:37.760 --> 2:39:42.160]  are right and so they're mad that you're not just going along with their charade because they're
[2:39:42.160 --> 2:39:46.800]  staying in an unconscious mode it's up to us to shake them out of that unconscious unconscious
[2:39:46.800 --> 2:39:51.120]  mode into the conscious mode and and they're going to be the ones like this this medical nurse
[2:39:51.120 --> 2:39:55.280]  that blew the whistle her friend died in the hospital another nurse they wouldn't give her
[2:39:55.280 --> 2:39:59.840]  ivermectin they killed her and and she saw them saying no it's the vaccine killing people
[2:40:00.720 --> 2:40:05.440]  and and killing our staff but we're not supposed to say that people dying the majority have had
[2:40:05.440 --> 2:40:10.240]  the shot well the numbers are out now so again they're now asking medical staff to cover up their
[2:40:10.240 --> 2:40:16.240]  friends deaths i mean how far are we gonna go with these insane looking medical heads these
[2:40:16.240 --> 2:40:22.640]  are not photoshop photos on screen this is what the british and other top health ministers look like
[2:40:22.640 --> 2:40:29.520]  look at these people what they don't even think they're human i i gotta tell you that um
[2:40:30.960 --> 2:40:36.960]  there are a lot more of us than there are of them and when we start uniting together i
[2:40:37.920 --> 2:40:42.080]  i really believe that when when moms start to get the truth and we start to unite together and we
[2:40:42.080 --> 2:40:47.440]  stand up you you don't stand against that you don't mess with mama bear and and the more that these
[2:40:47.440 --> 2:40:54.560]  moms are realizing what the truth is and these are moms who are teachers they are medical professionals
[2:40:54.560 --> 2:41:01.600]  as as i said one of our moms in florida is she is a nurse practitioner and they a few weeks back
[2:41:01.600 --> 2:41:06.000]  just about a month ago they got word that they were mandated they have a really big clinic
[2:41:06.000 --> 2:41:09.440]  five thousand in their clinic and they were mandated they were going to have to have the
[2:41:09.440 --> 2:41:14.320]  vaccine by november 1st so she's like this is enough so they held a medical freedom rally
[2:41:14.320 --> 2:41:20.320]  and the day before one of the moms posted who was the wife of the doctor posted flyers on all the
[2:41:20.320 --> 2:41:25.520]  cars in the in the parking lot and said what are you going to do on november 1st when one thousand
[2:41:25.520 --> 2:41:30.480]  of your medical staff doesn't show up and the next day they held the medical freedom conference
[2:41:30.480 --> 2:41:36.000]  which we had our our media team get involved in so they were all over the media on tuesday
[2:41:36.000 --> 2:41:42.000]  they issued a new letter with new information saying you want the vaccine you can get it if you
[2:41:42.000 --> 2:41:47.120]  don't you don't have to so it was a big win because they stood together in the united together
[2:41:47.120 --> 2:41:51.840]  and that's what we need to do they are they are threatening doctors with their licenses
[2:41:51.840 --> 2:41:58.160]  they told they told our our mom there in florida and everybody in that clinic if you if you don't
[2:41:58.160 --> 2:42:03.520]  take the vaccine by november 1st you'll lose your job if you if you want to put in a religious
[2:42:03.520 --> 2:42:07.760]  exemption you can but you'll have to wear a different colored badge so everybody knows
[2:42:07.760 --> 2:42:12.880]  literally like nazi germany and they pushed back and they had victory incredible listen
[2:42:12.880 --> 2:42:16.720]  i really like you kimberley fletcher moms from america dot us come back as soon as we're out of
[2:42:16.720 --> 2:42:21.680]  time and talk about your movement you reach millions of people uh where you see trump going

[2:42:26.400 --> 2:42:32.240]  our other broadcast we'll do all right thank you so much speaking everything she said i got a bunch
[2:42:32.240 --> 2:42:36.800]  of articles about that macron just got egged does is a massachusetts state troopers resign
[2:42:36.800 --> 2:42:43.520]  over covid vaccine mandate uh army flight surgeon urges pentagon to ground pilots who took covid
[2:42:43.520 --> 2:42:50.720]  injection suddenly i can't train i cannot play top tennis pro now barely alive after he took the
[2:42:50.720 --> 2:42:58.240]  vaccine and so much more straight ahead in full wars dot com tomorrow's news today news wars dot com
[2:42:58.240 --> 2:43:06.480]  it's only been in the last 60 years that we've had satellites that can decently measure what's
[2:43:06.480 --> 2:43:11.040]  happening in the atmosphere but if you look at all the different studies reports about my nasa
[2:43:11.040 --> 2:43:15.520]  and other governments and other agencies they all disagree on what's really happened with the climate
[2:43:16.160 --> 2:43:23.280]  the only concept the only great truth is change is the only constant so yes climate change
[2:43:23.280 --> 2:43:28.240]  is totally real but notice first they called it global freezing back in the 70s 80s and then
[2:43:28.240 --> 2:43:31.440]  it's gonna be global warming and when that didn't really happen the way they wanted to
[2:43:31.440 --> 2:43:37.200]  okay now it's just climate change but did you know that man-made climate change is a real thing
[2:43:37.760 --> 2:43:42.400]  when it comes to the united nations and the department of energy and bill gates and the
[2:43:42.400 --> 2:43:48.320]  un they have weather control trees for 1979 bill gates has been manipulating the weather
[2:43:48.320 --> 2:43:53.680]  for a very long time in fact back in 1994 two scientists won a Nobel prize for an idea of spring
[2:43:53.680 --> 2:43:58.480]  different particles out of jet engines to control the weather so yes man-made climate change is real
[2:43:59.600 --> 2:44:06.960]  so if you understand that this is not FDA approved it's totally experimental it's never been given
[2:44:06.960 --> 2:44:14.000]  to human beings before some of the ingredients inside of these of these shots have never been
[2:44:14.000 --> 2:44:20.000]  injected in human beings before there are no long-term studies we don't know what's going to
[2:44:20.000 --> 2:44:26.080]  happen inside your body somewhere four to six weeks after your second injection or four to six
[2:44:26.080 --> 2:44:32.640]  months or even two years we have no idea whether it's going to cause infertility whether it's
[2:44:32.640 --> 2:44:38.160]  going to cause cancer how bad your autoimmune disease is going to be my conclusion after
[2:44:38.160 --> 2:44:42.400]  looking at this for a long time and listening to the arguments for these masks i i've determined
[2:44:42.400 --> 2:44:47.760]  that if you believe if you're a medical doctor or a scientist that's spouting using these masks

[2:47:30.560 --> 2:47:43.120]  well we covered it earlier mainstream news like the yorker magazine is calling for burning down
[2:47:43.120 --> 2:47:48.080]  oil refineries blowing up pipelines basically killing people and the media is defending it saying
[2:47:48.080 --> 2:47:51.760]  well of course we're going to blow everything up and burn everything down except our businesses
[2:47:54.160 --> 2:47:58.160]  welcome back to alex jones show let me hit this news suddenly i cannot train
[2:47:58.160 --> 2:48:03.840]  i cannot play tennis pro 34 in season he's ranked one of the top players in the world
[2:48:03.840 --> 2:48:11.600]  after covid vaccine left him with violent pain in the heart of course french tennis player
[2:48:12.640 --> 2:48:18.400]  jeremy charty says he regrets having taken the vaccine and suggests he may retire early
[2:48:18.400 --> 2:48:24.240]  next year the problem is that we have no hindsight on the vaccine kind of vaccines
[2:48:24.240 --> 2:48:30.800]  experimental injection tennis pro 34 says he may never play again after taking the shot because
[2:48:30.800 --> 2:48:39.840]  he's so incredibly sick now and what it's done to his body and of course they admit that that's
[2:48:39.840 --> 2:48:45.520]  what it does we've got a side-by-side here of reuters articles in the last nine months of the
[2:48:45.520 --> 2:48:54.480]  rollout of the shot april 27 2021 us cdc has not seen link between heart inflammation and
[2:48:54.480 --> 2:49:04.000]  covid 19 vaccines oh really is that why in your october 2020 report that's on the cdc website
[2:49:05.680 --> 2:49:12.160]  you list everything that happened microcarditis are all of it why is that in the cdc report
[2:49:12.160 --> 2:49:20.720]  report oh but here they are months later november december january february march april here
[2:49:20.720 --> 2:49:27.600]  they are five months later weaponized lying to you us cdc has not seen link
[2:49:30.080 --> 2:49:33.040]  even though it was in a report five months before by them officially on their site
[2:49:33.680 --> 2:49:40.080]  us cdc has not seen link between heart inflammation and cdc 19 vaccines because other ones putting
[2:49:40.080 --> 2:49:44.320]  out making money off of it us cdc has not seen link between heart inflammation and covid 19
[2:49:44.320 --> 2:49:50.480]  vaccines liars here they are a few months later in may us cdc looking into heart inflammation
[2:49:50.480 --> 2:49:57.040]  and some young vaccine recipients and here they are in june fda to add warning about rare heart
[2:49:57.040 --> 2:50:03.520]  inflammation to phyzen moderna vaccines that's an older meme now you can say even by september
[2:50:04.400 --> 2:50:08.320]  early september hell late august they were saying okay it's not rare you can pull those
[2:50:08.320 --> 2:50:14.160]  headlines up heart inflammation and problems not rare like previously thought evidence grows
[2:50:14.160 --> 2:50:20.080]  stronger for covid vaccine link to heart issue cdc that's in june now it's all confirmed with a
[2:50:20.080 --> 2:50:32.320]  warning on it but back in december when we learned about the cdc documents they shut us down that
[2:50:32.320 --> 2:50:36.960]  was another reason jones has got to be man he's going to cost lives except a young man that had
[2:50:36.960 --> 2:50:41.920]  had the microcarditis on the golf team missed the championship may never be able to play while he's
[2:50:41.920 --> 2:50:46.720]  in college again could have died they said well you really did have a heart problem it did was
[2:50:46.720 --> 2:50:51.120]  caused by the shot but the un has decided you're not allowed to have that video we took it down
[2:50:51.120 --> 2:50:57.920]  that was yahoo news last week the un says an american college student and his doctor can't
[2:50:57.920 --> 2:51:07.600]  be interviewed and can't be heard from because the un said so you wake up and the united nations is
[2:51:07.600 --> 2:51:15.760]  in control and the airlines oh give him off the screen we're not allowed to show him un said take
[2:51:15.760 --> 2:51:22.720]  it down take it down that's right let's let's play biden with his mask on because he's had three
[2:51:22.720 --> 2:51:28.720]  shots but he's not protected and he could get you sick gotta keep wearing the mask gotta take
[2:51:28.720 --> 2:51:33.120]  booster shots every few months gotta stay locked up gotta gotta do it here go ahead and play with
[2:51:33.120 --> 2:51:38.160]  audio here here's here's biden a few hours ago getting his booster it just we just the government
[2:51:38.160 --> 2:51:42.320]  and the big pharma just puts in us what they want when they want doesn't matter because it's hard
[2:51:42.320 --> 2:51:46.000]  attacks and infertility oh there's big studies if i give me the yeet on clip i forgot to play
[2:51:46.000 --> 2:51:52.400]  from yesterday the the former head of Pfizer science actual scientist virologist talking about the
[2:51:52.400 --> 2:51:56.960]  attacking the ovaries but then they knew that a year ago too the shot but you don't need those
[2:51:56.960 --> 2:52:08.160]  pesky ovaries here's a bug we are helping we're doing more than every other nation in the world
[2:52:08.160 --> 2:52:13.840]  combined we're going to have well over a billion 100 million shots and we're going to continue
[2:52:13.840 --> 2:52:20.240]  going we're going to do our part we've also given a great deal of funding to covax which is the
[2:52:20.240 --> 2:52:27.440]  vehicle that does this so we have a plenty plenty of opportunity to make sure we get everyone in
[2:52:27.440 --> 2:52:34.000]  the world to play our part the largest part of the world to get everyone back and if you believe
[2:52:34.000 --> 2:52:38.880]  they really put that in his arm i got a bridge on the moon i want to tell you that's enough keep
[2:52:38.880 --> 2:52:43.360]  that skeleton on the screen and again we're meant to hate him and i do hate him and i want to see him
[2:52:43.360 --> 2:52:51.600]  go to president with the rest of his dirty family but a pedophile scum but he's a puppet so my hate
[2:52:51.600 --> 2:52:57.520]  for him is a one my hate for swab and mill gates and the globalist is a trillion okay we're meant
[2:52:57.520 --> 2:53:01.680]  to hate him we're meant to focus on him instead of the people controlling it all he's designed to
[2:53:01.680 --> 2:53:05.920]  run down the country he's designed to bring it all down so the globalist can take over let's not let
[2:53:05.920 --> 2:53:10.000]  that happen let's again we need to talk about the globalist the politicians do as well where do you
[2:53:10.000 --> 2:53:14.320]  hear ran paul where do you hear josh holly where do you hear ted crows about the new world order and
[2:53:14.320 --> 2:53:19.040]  the great reset and how this is a global carbon tax marmarano used to be the chief advisor to the
[2:53:19.040 --> 2:53:25.040]  republican senate on global warming they all know him he's saying it's a global carbon tax takeover
[2:53:25.040 --> 2:53:31.600]  here's mastercard here's bank of england here's jp morgan all saying it starts now not a word out
[2:53:31.600 --> 2:53:38.880]  of republicans that i've seen i mean we're being attacked by global corporate government
[2:53:38.880 --> 2:53:42.480]  but so we're going to be locked down forever that's in full control of the e u in australia
[2:53:42.480 --> 2:53:48.800]  partial control of the uk and us and we just sit here under corporate governance global
[2:53:48.800 --> 2:53:54.320]  governance with our captured nations as kashwa goes we have captured america we have captured the other
[2:53:54.320 --> 2:54:01.920]  countries it is quite good that we are now in control we will change your body he will control
[2:54:01.920 --> 2:54:10.400]  your body now okay i'm not saying you'll have a job not everyone can polish robots hey well that's
[2:54:10.400 --> 2:54:15.280]  not a very good german accent uh he's german but i mean he speaks french he speaks at all i mean it's
[2:54:15.280 --> 2:54:19.200]  like a it's a bond villain voice you're like is that russian is that german is that french
[2:54:20.320 --> 2:54:25.440]  every time he talks is different like kissinger i mean look he might pull a mask off it's like
[2:54:25.440 --> 2:54:32.800]  marz attack there's an alien under there i mean that's how he acts the great reset will never
[2:54:32.800 --> 2:54:41.920]  end it is a cut economy will never come back yeah very angry world coming very angry here's a
[2:54:41.920 --> 2:54:47.200]  dr yedon former chief scientist at fives are telling you about your ovaries and the covid shot
[2:54:49.040 --> 2:54:54.240]  last month we know four people who've died shortly after vaccination uh none of them were
[2:54:54.240 --> 2:54:58.960]  particularly old none of them were older than 70 and we know another half a dozen people who are
[2:54:58.960 --> 2:55:03.360]  oh by the way i forgot to tell you this is like a six-month-old quibitz it's in the hundreds of
[2:55:03.360 --> 2:55:07.040]  thousands now that he just specifically talked about those they admit the vaccine kill like the
[2:55:07.040 --> 2:55:13.600]  like the bbc presenter oh well let's continue i agree i'm a toxicologist as well as a pharmacologist
[2:55:13.600 --> 2:55:20.080]  and i just couldn't believe what they the design of these vaccines is is stupid um for that one of
[2:55:20.080 --> 2:55:27.200]  the reasons you just described um but separately from that it was known for years maybe decades that
[2:55:27.920 --> 2:55:33.040]  that this spike proteins of coronaviruses are so-called fusagenic they prompt cells to come
[2:55:33.040 --> 2:55:40.560]  together um you know there's a feline peronitis vaccine which has a spike protein and coronavirus
[2:55:40.560 --> 2:55:46.160]  and and and we know that the spike protein itself is biologically active so it's it's just a stupid
[2:55:46.160 --> 2:55:52.160]  idea that you would present that into people without for example mutating it so that it would lose
[2:55:52.160 --> 2:55:58.000]  its biological activity but retain a lot of its immunogenic structure so that that was a stupid
[2:55:58.000 --> 2:56:06.160]  idea and i've also recently discovered in the last month or so that for the mRNA vaccines uh that use
[2:56:06.160 --> 2:56:13.360]  a lipid nanoparticle formulation in order to protect the payload uh unfortunately those lipid
[2:56:13.360 --> 2:56:20.560]  nanoparticles themselves have had a more than a decades-long technical problem well known
[2:56:21.280 --> 2:56:26.800]  to specialists in the industry which is that they concentrate in ovaries there's a paper
[2:56:26.800 --> 2:56:31.200]  i've quoted which is on a website for the truth for health foundation for whom i'm
[2:56:31.200 --> 2:56:37.600]  chief scientific advisor the paper in 2012 that actually talks exactly about that these lipid nanocarriers
[2:56:37.600 --> 2:56:45.440]  uh and ovarian toxicity an underappreciated human toxicity risk and yet in 2019 2020
[2:56:46.080 --> 2:56:53.200]  Moderna and Pfizer both chose lipid nanoparticles um and i said this is from six months ago this
[2:56:53.200 --> 2:56:56.960]  is from a year ago notice it all came true like you said we're going to go to break we've got
[2:56:56.960 --> 2:57:02.480]  Gerald Salente coming up i've got some more news i'm going to hit first but remember i'm in a war

[2:57:51.440 --> 2:57:58.720]  biden and his corporate controllers are lying to you this is not a pandemic of the unvaccinated
[2:57:58.720 --> 2:58:05.680]  this is an engineered virus in a lab that they then injected into the public using their poison
[2:58:05.680 --> 2:58:12.640]  vaccine so the body then created mutations that actually spread even worse like the delta variant
[2:58:12.640 --> 2:58:19.280]  that is scientifically admitted that is mainline science and not even debated but the general public
[2:58:19.280 --> 2:58:26.720]  does not even know that so when that criminal with his pedophile crackhead son gets up there
[2:58:26.720 --> 2:58:33.280]  on television and tells you that you are to blame because you didn't take your poison shot that is
[2:58:33.280 --> 2:58:40.560]  a giant lie countries like israel and singapore with the highest vaccine rate at the highest
[2:58:40.560 --> 2:58:46.640]  death and highest illness rates that is the facts get that information out to your friends family
[2:58:46.640 --> 2:58:49.360]  and strangers like your life depends on it because it does
[2:58:49.360 --> 2:58:58.160]  this generally it's general milley i just want you to know that trump tried to overthrow the
[2:58:58.160 --> 2:59:03.200]  u.s. government two days ago on january six and i just want you to know i've taken control of the
[2:59:03.200 --> 2:59:07.680]  nuclear weapons and if trump tries to launch an attack on you we'll let you know first the attack's
[2:59:07.680 --> 2:59:15.280]  coming that is from the transcript then he called uh palosin schumer and others to say i'm loyal to
[2:59:15.280 --> 2:59:20.080]  you i'm going to protect trump from using nuclear weapons but trump was going for detente with china
[2:59:20.080 --> 2:59:24.640]  and north korea at the time and trups responded saying it's a total lie palosin's come out and
[2:59:24.640 --> 2:59:29.760]  admitted it happened hell she bragged back on january 8th that it took place then and is saying
[2:59:29.760 --> 2:59:34.320]  that she honors milley and that he's this courageous person so we're all these other democrats
[2:59:34.320 --> 2:59:38.880]  so this is the permanent deep state coup that's been in control for a long time now coming out
[2:59:38.880 --> 2:59:43.840]  of the shadows publicly remember these people literally hate you and your family now they're
[2:59:43.840 --> 2:59:49.040]  injecting you with poison soft kill injections wake up america or be destroyed
[2:59:49.040 --> 3:00:10.400]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:00:10.400 --> 3:00:26.000]  yeah well you ain't been to the other dimension brother i got the answers i got god i got what i'm
[3:00:26.000 --> 3:00:35.920]  after i got what i'm after long before i died when i didn't fight in some fake church you found
[3:00:35.920 --> 3:00:41.600]  the devil there i found it in opening myself up to god and the universe and studying history and
[3:00:41.600 --> 3:00:47.360]  challenging evil brings you closer to the creator jeroz the lid day is taken over from kingston new
[3:00:47.360 --> 3:00:55.040]  york coming up in t minus five minutes and i did a decent job that i covered about 80 percent of
[3:00:55.040 --> 3:00:58.160]  the news i wanted to get to but there's a lot i haven't gotten to so what i'm gonna do is
[3:00:58.160 --> 3:01:05.840]  is get some of that now and then i am going to be back in a special report we're gonna file tonight
[3:01:05.840 --> 3:01:12.800]  because this is really a big deal globally they're cutting off the resources that's the great reset
[3:01:12.800 --> 3:01:17.360]  to artificially collapsed society one big way is the value in currencies another big way has been
[3:01:17.360 --> 3:01:22.880]  the global lockdowns that have just decimated the third world now there is spike proteins being
[3:01:22.880 --> 3:01:29.200]  released by the vaccinated causing real illnesses and so 90 percent of fuel pumps run dry in major
[3:01:29.200 --> 3:01:35.120]  british cities after panic buying there were already shortages last week so it's not the panic buying
[3:01:35.920 --> 3:01:40.080]  like mainstream news is saying when you read deeper it's because
[3:01:42.320 --> 3:01:47.520]  the fuel companies are refusing to pay what the crude oil the refining actually cost same thing in
[3:01:47.520 --> 3:01:54.160]  china power outages hit china threatening the economy and christmas new york times so much
[3:01:55.200 --> 3:02:01.200]  inflation is happening that they're unable to make deals quick enough to up the price and so
[3:02:01.200 --> 3:02:05.120]  it's breaking down supply chains if you read deeper the new york times they actually admit
[3:02:06.240 --> 3:02:11.600]  as electricity demand has risen it has also pushed up the price of coal to generate that
[3:02:11.600 --> 3:02:14.800]  electricity well at least they're allowed to have coal we're not they've shot our plants down
[3:02:14.800 --> 3:02:20.240]  but chinese regulators have not let utilities raise rates enough to cover the rising coal cost
[3:02:21.040 --> 3:02:27.040]  so the utilities have been slow to operate their power plants for more hours and so we
[3:02:27.040 --> 3:02:30.880]  can't get all our little slave goods and plastic goods that break before they're out of the box
[3:02:30.880 --> 3:02:36.880]  from communist china meanwhile costco limits purchases of toilet paper towels and bottled water
[3:02:36.880 --> 3:02:43.280]  i mean inflation supply chain issues yeah it's supply chain and it's inflation right mark gets it
[3:02:43.280 --> 3:02:48.880]  right over the weekend it's like people are panic buying that's why there's not enough tv dinners
[3:02:48.880 --> 3:02:54.160]  and enough of this that no i am in the business of selling a lot of products and enforce we're
[3:02:54.160 --> 3:02:58.320]  dot com they're quality that let us fund ourselves because we don't have george sorrell's funding
[3:02:58.320 --> 3:03:02.400]  we're funded by you and everything's been breaking down for over a year and a half and now it's
[3:03:02.400 --> 3:03:06.320]  getting worse and worse and now there's real stuff going around getting people sick and when one
[3:03:06.320 --> 3:03:11.840]  person gets sick they shut whole factories down this is how you sabotage and have a great reset
[3:03:11.840 --> 3:03:17.040]  just like the low level leftist blow up pipelines the high level globalists turn them off the big
[3:03:17.040 --> 3:03:22.800]  banks just simply pass regulations and carbon taxes where you can't even extract or use it
[3:03:22.800 --> 3:03:28.160]  and then they sit back in society and plows and go well we better depopulate okay let's start with
[3:03:28.160 --> 3:03:32.720]  claus schwaub and bill gates i'm not going to kill them but your guys are in new yorker magazine
[3:03:32.720 --> 3:03:37.600]  how you're going to fireball and blow up refineries and blow up all this stuff and i'm just saying
[3:03:37.600 --> 3:03:43.680]  we're going to identify who's behind it and you're not going to get away with it yep now they want
[3:03:43.680 --> 3:03:48.560]  to call the army out to the gas pumps and and now over new york and having up doctors and nurses
[3:03:48.560 --> 3:03:53.600]  because the half of them quit so we'll put the military in there how's the military gonna gonna
[3:03:53.600 --> 3:03:58.400]  take care of when you have a heart attack this is destabilizing the economy of the world to
[3:03:58.400 --> 3:04:02.560]  collapse it so the big mega banks can come in and buy it all it pays in the dollar instead of going
[3:04:02.560 --> 3:04:07.760]  to jail at jp morgan and goldman sacks like burning made off they've done crimes thousands of times
[3:04:07.760 --> 3:04:13.520]  bigger conservatively so they get to run the world and give us a great reset and the left wants free
[3:04:13.520 --> 3:04:17.840]  universal incomes they sit there and toadie around and grapple to it all right i'm out of time today

[3:04:51.760 --> 3:04:57.440]  the trends journal and trends research institute takes over in 60 seconds so tell folks tune in
[3:05:00.720 --> 3:05:06.160]  i'll tell you what's life and death if you don't have freedom of speech if if you don't have the
[3:05:06.160 --> 3:05:11.280]  right to be able to communicate then you don't have a future always when governments take away
[3:05:11.280 --> 3:05:15.600]  speech they then enslave the population and then they finally start exterminating the population
[3:05:15.600 --> 3:05:21.200]  and america the entire world is going down the tubes because the un globals directed great reset
[3:05:21.200 --> 3:05:24.960]  that's why it's more important than ever that info works stay on the air and that all of us stay

[3:06:54.960 --> 3:06:59.680]  i'm going to follow up on a couple of things alex is talking about who's talking about in
[3:07:00.240 --> 3:07:08.480]  how they're having trouble now staffing hospitals this is from the toilet paper of record today
[3:07:09.120 --> 3:07:15.040]  the new york times they got this arrogant line by the way in the front all the news that's fit
[3:07:15.040 --> 3:07:21.840]  to print you mean all the crap that spews out of your bs mouth that you want to shove down
[3:07:21.840 --> 3:07:30.080]  our throats all the news that's fit to print who the hell are you to say what's fit to print
[3:07:30.080 --> 3:07:34.000]  your little prostitute slimmers but here's the article
[3:07:34.000 --> 3:07:44.960]  as vaccine wary staff prepare to lose jobs new york hospitals brace for strength
[3:07:51.920 --> 3:07:57.840]  how come you're the little lowlife boys and girls that have been pumping the crap out
[3:07:57.840 --> 3:08:05.840]  out that the people that don't want to get vax are right wing trump supporters
[3:08:08.720 --> 3:08:18.320]  right conspiracy theory believers do you know why these people don't want to get vaccinated
[3:08:18.320 --> 3:08:20.800]  which the slimmers will never say
[3:08:20.800 --> 3:08:28.880]  say because they've seen the dangers of what the vaccinations have done to people
[3:08:30.160 --> 3:08:37.920]  and they don't want to take the jab but nobody talks about that they've seen it firsthand
[3:08:39.120 --> 3:08:46.720]  they've lived with it but yet you got these little gutless clowns spewing the crap out
[3:08:46.720 --> 3:08:56.560]  of their mouth like chris rock and all the other junior little comedians blowing out their crap
[3:08:59.200 --> 3:09:06.960]  about why you should get vaccinated as bs two shots rock got the virus again
[3:09:06.960 --> 3:09:13.520]  and still telling people to get it this is why they won't get it they've seen it
[3:09:13.520 --> 3:09:25.120]  and again operation warp speed you got to be warped to believe that a warp speed is attested

[3:09:34.080 --> 3:09:40.000]  what they're doing now to change the dna in india leading the charge to gene therapy shot first
[3:09:40.000 --> 3:09:47.120]  ever injected into humans and you're a conspiracy theorist and a moron for not getting it and again
[3:09:47.840 --> 3:09:58.560]  you saw that stupid story they had about the view about how oh they had to change everything because

[3:30:14.080 --> 3:30:19.360]  people a placebo and then you really look at how the outcome is for a long period of time not four
[3:30:19.360 --> 3:30:25.360]  weeks there's a lot of these injuries the autoimmune injuries you're not going to see in four weeks
[3:30:25.360 --> 3:30:30.640]  the cancer you're not going to see in four weeks and many of the neurological injuries you won't
[3:30:30.640 --> 3:30:36.960]  see for four weeks if the experience with other vaccines is instructive you look at the other
[3:30:36.960 --> 3:30:44.080]  vaccines that are currently in the schedule and there's about 400 injuries illnesses chronic
[3:30:44.080 --> 3:30:49.920]  illnesses that are listed robert kennedy jr is just one of more than 40 powerful voices

[3:31:01.760 --> 3:31:07.920]  senses that we are kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies we are told and the only way to see
[3:31:07.920 --> 3:31:13.760]  through this illusion is with our higher senses which is why fluoridated water is a big problem
[3:31:14.320 --> 3:31:19.680]  consuming too much fluoride forms phosphate crystals around the pineal gland and shuts down
[3:31:19.680 --> 3:31:25.440]  its natural functions natural functions which have been known for millennia the hindu chakras
[3:31:25.440 --> 3:31:30.080]  align with the endocrine system the chakra aligned with the pineal gland is the third eye
[3:31:30.640 --> 3:31:36.400]  also described as the seat of the soul the pineal gland is what connects us to higher levels of
[3:31:36.400 --> 3:31:43.040]  consciousness and otherwise unseen dimensions of reality fluoride free water is essential to
[3:31:43.040 --> 3:31:49.120]  keeping our pineal gland healthy our water filtration systems with the proper filters
[3:31:49.120 --> 3:31:55.040]  will keep your drinking water fluoride free and the pro pure showerhead will seal the deal get
[3:31:55.040 --> 3:32:03.120]  them both today for yourself or a friend at info war store dot com i have the greatest sense of
[3:32:03.120 --> 3:32:09.440]  loss deep in my heart even my soul i've ever had in my 47 years on this planet i've had a lot of
[3:32:09.440 --> 3:32:20.560]  lost everybody else has and it's because it's a loss of ancestral freedom that so many people
[3:32:20.560 --> 3:32:27.200]  fought and died and bled and sweat for and now we're just throwing it all away
[3:32:27.200 --> 3:32:33.600]  and i see the general public in a medically induced scientifically induced behavioral
[3:32:33.600 --> 3:32:40.720]  psychologically controlled 20 and i know we're being fed into this globalist meat grinder
[3:32:40.720 --> 3:32:48.800]  and it's so incredibly sad but this is the process of birth and then growth and then falling apart
[3:32:48.800 --> 3:32:54.400]  and then degenerating collapsing and then coming back to life again it's just the globalist are
[3:32:54.400 --> 3:32:59.360]  actively trying to steer and control this process of decadence and collapse to actually end the
[3:32:59.360 --> 3:33:10.320]  species as we know it you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:33:10.320 --> 3:33:29.600]  you're listening to the alex jones show and now your host jerald solente
[3:33:32.080 --> 3:33:38.000]  hey great being on the alex jones show as i said you know we're in the we're in the fight for our
[3:33:38.000 --> 3:33:48.080]  lives now i was a speaker at um ron paul's war on us event in dc back in the beginning of the month
[3:33:48.880 --> 3:33:57.760]  and rfk jr roby kennedy jr was one of the speakers i preceded him actually and
[3:33:59.760 --> 3:34:06.000]  as he's walking off stage we were you know talking about the loss of our freedom he said
[3:34:06.000 --> 3:34:15.840]  he said i will fight to my death with my boots on very emotional and that's what we're in we're
[3:34:15.840 --> 3:34:22.560]  in the fight for our lives that they're destroying us like this and robbing our freedom you imagine
[3:34:22.560 --> 3:34:30.880]  forcing us to get vaccinated that that god now is science god isn't nature anymore natural healing
[3:34:30.880 --> 3:34:39.520]  is not permitted so i say this because there are very few of us out there that are fighting for
[3:34:39.520 --> 3:34:45.120]  this freedom and does not take a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority
[3:34:45.760 --> 3:34:52.000]  keen on setting brush fires of freedom in the minds of men's and samuel adams and info was
[3:34:52.560 --> 3:35:00.320]  is that part of that irate tireless minority as am i so you need to do what you can to support
[3:35:00.320 --> 3:35:06.320]  info was and one of the ways to support them and get a great product in the meantime is this
[3:35:06.320 --> 3:35:14.800]  wonderful movie that they just did and it's called covet land yep and it's the first info was original
[3:35:14.800 --> 3:35:21.040]  documentary production in nine years and i was on a number of the other ones and they teamed up with
[3:35:21.040 --> 3:35:30.320]  paul wittenberter from framing the world productions to produce a five-part documentary series called
[3:35:30.320 --> 3:35:38.000]  covet land and episode one is called the lockdown and it chronicles the early days of covet 19 pandemic
[3:35:38.000 --> 3:35:43.040]  and shows how big tech mainstream media and governments deceive the world into accepting
[3:35:43.040 --> 3:35:51.280]  lockdowns using fraudulent cases inflated data and you know fake news and there he is there's a fake
[3:35:51.280 --> 3:35:58.880]  news freak himself and then you also you you can pre-order covet land the lockdown on high quality

[3:36:45.120 --> 3:36:52.080]  so in order to do that and help do that get this dvd and get it out to everyone you know because
[3:36:52.080 --> 3:36:57.360]  we're we're in the time of our lives here and because the filmmaking team really wants you

[3:37:39.840 --> 3:37:45.280]  coming when the winter comes they're going to start blowing this thing up again and stealing
[3:37:45.280 --> 3:37:52.640]  more of our freedom from us and as I said before you know the rich have taken over everything
[3:37:53.920 --> 3:38:01.440]  so we have to support each other and doing what we can to stop this and I'm not making it up I'm
[3:38:01.440 --> 3:38:05.840]  reading any of the facts over here we put them in the trends journal every week the big's getting
[3:38:05.840 --> 3:38:15.600]  bigger here America's richest 400 families pay a lower tax rate than the average taxpayer this is
[3:38:15.600 --> 3:38:25.600]  in a conspiracy theory this is from CNBC as I had forecast in the very beginning of this
[3:38:28.560 --> 3:38:34.800]  this thing is going to go out you're going to see homeless and crime rate rise spikes like we've
[3:38:34.800 --> 3:38:44.480]  never seen before this is from sunday's new york post zombie land
[3:38:48.080 --> 3:38:54.800]  the garment district is turned into a lawless shooting gallery of smack addicts getting high
[3:38:54.800 --> 3:39:07.680]  in broad daylight all right it's all over the place yeah big pharma helped turn them into them too
[3:39:08.400 --> 3:39:10.960]  plus all the lockdowns that put up people out of work
[3:39:14.080 --> 3:39:24.640]  so two things number one if the covet was so deadly how come it's not killing all the homeless
[3:39:24.640 --> 3:39:31.600]  people and all these drug addicts and killing 78 percent of the people according to the cdc
[3:39:31.600 --> 3:39:43.680]  that are hospitalized are obese and overweight and 94 point 94 percent have 2.6 pre-existing
[3:39:43.680 --> 3:39:47.760]  comorbidities how come they're not saying that and number two
[3:39:47.760 --> 3:39:55.680]  as to the homeless i have a solution the salentee solution for the homeless
[3:39:57.680 --> 3:40:10.480]  it is moronic and stupid to house these people in hotels and single occupancy housing center
[3:40:10.480 --> 3:40:19.840]  look at this it's all over the country more and more there's never like this get them out get
[3:40:19.840 --> 3:40:26.640]  them out get them out and give them a life by putting them in a room or letting them sleep
[3:40:26.640 --> 3:40:34.640]  outside is not going to help them up here where i am in kingston we're at the foothills of the
[3:40:34.640 --> 3:40:42.880]  catskill mountains used to be called a borstbelt it's where the great comedians and bands used
[3:40:42.880 --> 3:40:49.600]  to play back in the day when this whole area was thriving with the big hotels out there
[3:40:49.600 --> 3:40:57.440]  grossages and you know one after another brown and now these places are empty oh it was caught
[3:40:57.440 --> 3:41:02.240]  it the empty i just drove around yesterday at the top down in the car it was a beautiful day
[3:41:02.240 --> 3:41:10.000]  i want to get the last in there and driving around and i thought to myself
[3:41:11.680 --> 3:41:20.640]  why not build hometowns not homeless towns hometowns instead of wasting tens of billions
[3:41:20.640 --> 3:41:28.720]  of dollars putting these four people in one room in the wind staying in a room built a hometown
[3:41:28.720 --> 3:41:34.400]  not a homeless town a hometown for the homeless and now you can give them things to do in the
[3:41:34.400 --> 3:41:38.400]  winter they could garden they could do crafts they could do arts they could be busy they could be
[3:41:38.400 --> 3:41:47.440]  working like a boys town like they used to do to me that's this easy solution because this thing's
[3:41:47.440 --> 3:41:53.440]  going to keep going down bigger and hotter with all these vax passports they've they've imposed
[3:41:53.440 --> 3:41:59.280]  us people aren't going i can't go i can't go i can't go to the senate garage to listen to jazz
[3:41:59.280 --> 3:42:04.400]  i can't go to basal theater and woodstock listen to jazz i can't go to the falcons listen to jazz
[3:42:04.400 --> 3:42:11.760]  places i used to go to because i don't have a vaccine passport and i'm not alone so the
[3:42:11.760 --> 3:42:16.960]  homeless situation is going to get much worse because businesses are going to get much worse
[3:42:16.960 --> 3:42:25.920]  people are going to be out of work much worse so that's my solution hometowns for the homeless
[3:42:26.640 --> 3:42:32.800]  this is more ironic what they're doing we got stupid little freaks little scum
[3:42:33.840 --> 3:42:39.840]  now the politicians making these rules up just like they made the covid war start all the other
[3:42:39.840 --> 3:42:46.240]  wars they don't know what they're doing they're morons and imbeciles yeah there's the imbeciled

[3:44:10.320 --> 3:44:18.080]  death and damage in its own right that it's the aluminum as an adjuvant in the vaccine a known

[3:44:24.320 --> 3:44:31.920]  placebo totally inappropriate this is not good science it is not science at all it is an effort
[3:44:31.920 --> 3:44:38.400]  to cover up the true adverse reaction rates to the vaccines so that they can get through the low
[3:44:38.400 --> 3:44:45.200]  barrier of constraints put there by the fda and onto the market that is the only concern dr wakefield

[3:57:59.360 --> 3:58:06.400]  have been announcing it here as well that means allegiance to a tyrannical world corporate government
[3:58:06.400 --> 3:58:11.440]  established by the rockefellers through the un and they want inside your bodies to put in you what
[3:58:11.440 --> 3:58:18.400]  they want when they want and to have the global digital tracking covid passes or vaccine passes
[3:58:18.400 --> 3:58:24.640]  to form the backbone of their new world id and now their puppet body has announced the forced
[3:58:24.640 --> 3:58:30.720]  inoculation of 100 million americans to keep their jobs in total violation of the nuremberg code
[3:58:30.720 --> 3:58:35.440]  this is criminal and he's lying saying it's an approved vaccine when they did not approve it they
[3:58:35.440 --> 3:58:40.960]  say that's a 20 25 maybe they just expanded the emergency authorization that's why the two top
[3:58:40.960 --> 3:58:45.920]  scientists quit a week and a half ago well you live to see an absolute new world order world
[3:58:45.920 --> 3:58:54.240]  government if you submit they will totally enslave you when bob woodward's new book came out alleging
[3:58:54.240 --> 3:58:58.560]  that general milley had called the head of the chinese military and said trump might nuke you
[3:58:58.560 --> 3:59:02.880]  he tried to overthrow the u.s government but basically i'm protecting you and i'll warn you
[3:59:02.880 --> 3:59:07.600]  if we launch an attack which was the greatest reason us history that has ever been committed
[3:59:08.160 --> 3:59:12.240]  people said oh alex it must not be true and i might wait bob woodward's former naval intelligence
[3:59:12.240 --> 3:59:16.880]  he's a big insider globalist he wouldn't have put this out unless they wanted to put it out
[3:59:16.880 --> 3:59:21.760]  say that billy was a hero to set the precedent you can have a permanent bureaucracy stay behind
[3:59:21.760 --> 3:59:26.240]  network deep state basically that has its own bureaucratic coup over america that's why he put
[3:59:26.240 --> 3:59:30.800]  five in he's so incredibly weak he's to undermine the idea of the presidency well people said i was
[3:59:30.800 --> 3:59:35.680]  making it up with bob woodward's line well now milley admits he did it you see i didn't need to
[3:59:35.680 --> 3:59:40.880]  trust bob woodward i remember polosi on january eight ragging that she'd gotten a call for milley
[3:59:40.880 --> 3:59:44.720]  that he'd take control of the nukes so this treason was hiding and playing to you back then
[3:59:44.720 --> 3:59:49.040]  and we covered it see i have a memory folks i remember all this stuff that's why i know it's
[3:59:49.040 --> 4:00:01.680]  true and what's false you're listening to the alex jones show
