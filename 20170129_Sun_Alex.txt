[00:00.000 --> 00:11.000]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[00:21.000 --> 00:25.000]  The first month of 2017 is almost over.
[00:25.000 --> 00:28.000]  The sun is setting on it as we speak.
[00:28.000 --> 00:35.000]  This is the Sunday Transmission, the 29th day of January 2017.
[00:35.000 --> 00:36.000]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:36.000 --> 00:44.000]  We will be here live for the next two hours as we are every Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. Central.
[00:44.000 --> 00:48.000]  Well, I think the best name for Trump at this point, eight days into his presidency,
[00:48.000 --> 00:52.000]  eight and a half days in, is Trump the Deliverer.
[00:52.000 --> 01:00.000]  And I mean that as a double meaning, yes, a Deliverer from evil in the Moses, Exodus type, art type.
[01:00.000 --> 01:07.000]  But more importantly, a Deliverer when it comes to his promises, which is the same thing, isn't it?
[01:07.000 --> 01:13.000]  I was sitting here right before he went live on air with over 200 news articles in front of me that are all bombshell.
[01:13.000 --> 01:16.000]  A lot of them exclusives to infowars.com.
[01:16.000 --> 01:18.000]  I'm thinking, man, where do I start here?
[01:18.000 --> 01:21.000]  Well, it's just that Trump is a Deliverer.
[01:21.000 --> 01:23.000]  He delivers.
[01:23.000 --> 01:28.000]  Now, that kind of sounds like blasphemous, like, you know, God's the Deliverer, Moses is the Deliverer.
[01:28.000 --> 01:36.000]  But I meant it in my own mind is like delivering the goods, delivering on what he says he'll do.
[01:36.000 --> 01:40.000]  The truth teller, the oath keeper, honorable.
[01:40.000 --> 01:47.000]  In fact, he's so good, the word that's being used is dizzying.
[01:47.000 --> 01:50.000]  And I'm a little dizzy trying to keep track of it all.
[01:50.000 --> 02:01.000]  I mean, just today, a lifetime ban on lobbying for foreign governments, that will untie so many foreign entanglements,
[02:01.000 --> 02:05.000]  so many metastasized tentacles into our country from foreign powers.
[02:05.000 --> 02:09.000]  That will wreck globalism so bad, even if it just gets four years.
[02:09.000 --> 02:14.000]  And then a five-year ban, which is very reasonable, so you're not like making deals right before you leave.
[02:14.000 --> 02:17.000]  It's the same thing as a ban for a lifetime.
[02:17.000 --> 02:22.000]  A five-year ban on lobbying internally, even with U.S. companies.
[02:22.000 --> 02:25.000]  This is really a big deal.
[02:25.000 --> 02:34.000]  And signing the orders on the border wall, signing the orders banning people coming in from radical Islamic countries until they're being vetted,
[02:34.000 --> 02:41.000]  moving forward on just haunchowing massive factory jobs coming back to the U.S.,
[02:41.000 --> 02:47.000]  signing the beginning orders to kill the individual mandate, making you get Obamacare from private companies.
[02:47.000 --> 02:50.000]  Talk about slavery, that's what that was.
[02:50.000 --> 02:57.000]  I've got to sit back with my crew and somehow, because it's like five or six, seven promises a day he's keeping
[02:57.000 --> 02:59.000]  and try to have some big article tomorrow.
[02:59.000 --> 03:04.000]  In fact, I'm going to call Watson, it's like midnight there now, but after the show today,
[03:04.000 --> 03:09.000]  and I'm going to say, or like 10 o'clock at night, I'm going to say, please work with me tomorrow.
[03:09.000 --> 03:12.000]  Can we put out a big article on all the promises Trump has kept?
[03:12.000 --> 03:17.000]  I mean, normally in four or eight years, you'd look back and hope to have one or two promises kept.
[03:17.000 --> 03:21.000]  I was saying, if you got 30, 40 percent done, I'd be pleased.
[03:21.000 --> 03:24.000]  It's ridiculous at this point.
[03:24.000 --> 03:26.000]  And then I tuned in to CNN.
[03:26.000 --> 03:30.000]  It's bashing, lying, calling him a liar, twisting information.
[03:30.000 --> 03:32.000]  I tuned in to MSNBC even worse.
[03:32.000 --> 03:35.000]  Then this morning, I did a good boy's job.
[03:35.000 --> 03:38.000]  I worked out for two hours.
[03:38.000 --> 03:42.000]  20 minutes on the elliptical hour and a half workout, another 15 minutes on the elliptical.
[03:42.000 --> 03:44.000]  But I had Fox News on.
[03:44.000 --> 03:50.000]  I got a garage gym at my house and they were attacking Trump.
[03:50.000 --> 03:53.000]  Oh, they'd have a Democrat on to say he's a liar.
[03:53.000 --> 03:56.000]  No one was at his inauguration or no illegals vote.
[03:56.000 --> 03:58.000]  And then they'd have the softball person.
[03:58.000 --> 04:03.000]  No, he's just mistaken, not a known liar.
[04:03.000 --> 04:07.000]  That is total good cop, bad cop, crapola.
[04:07.000 --> 04:09.000]  And I'm not in competition with Fox News.
[04:09.000 --> 04:11.000]  I wish they would just tell the truth, save the country and whatever.
[04:11.000 --> 04:12.000]  But I got to call them out.
[04:12.000 --> 04:14.000]  They are disgusting.
[04:14.000 --> 04:18.000]  Other than Sean Hannity, Fox and friends and Tucker Carlson.
[04:18.000 --> 04:23.000]  It is a disgusting train wreck of people that aren't stars who've been told by their bosses,
[04:23.000 --> 04:26.000]  you attack Trump or you're gone.
[04:26.000 --> 04:28.000]  And it's disgusting.
[04:28.000 --> 04:30.000]  I can care less if Trump was bad.
[04:30.000 --> 04:32.000]  Attack him all you want.
[04:32.000 --> 04:35.000]  He's so good.
[04:35.000 --> 04:37.000]  I don't know what to say at this point.
[04:37.000 --> 04:41.000]  He talked to Putin yesterday and a bunch of the world leaders, the British Prime Minister came.
[04:41.000 --> 04:42.000]  We'll get to that.
[04:42.000 --> 04:47.000]  We'll get to what's really happened with the big riots and, you know, all the Islamists that are flooding in,
[04:47.000 --> 04:50.000]  piss, they can't just come here and have anchor babies for free.
[04:50.000 --> 04:55.000]  All the pregnant women get off the airplanes, get ready to break water or whatever and have us pay for all.
[04:55.000 --> 04:57.000]  They're all crap with their pants.
[04:57.000 --> 04:59.000]  We'll cover all that.
[04:59.000 --> 05:03.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here on the road with a very important announcement.
[05:03.000 --> 05:11.000]  Roger Stone's new book that is coming out in a couple of weeks is exclusively available at pre-order at infowarsstore.com.
[05:11.000 --> 05:15.000]  It's the making of a president and it breaks down how Trump really got elected.
[05:15.000 --> 05:22.000]  The inside baseball, the current battles and a blueprint for the future and what Trump and others are really planning to do to restore the Republican prosperity.
[05:22.000 --> 05:26.000]  The bottom line, this is the book that got Roger Stone poisoned with polonium.
[05:26.000 --> 05:32.000]  It breaks down what really happened with the Russians and so much more and it supports him and it supports info wars in our whole operation.
[05:32.000 --> 05:37.000]  So it's essential that this book go to the top of the charts in the political area, if not to the very top of the charts.
[05:37.000 --> 05:40.000]  Joe Biden has come out and said world government is collapsing.
[05:40.000 --> 05:41.000]  They're in full crisis mode.
[05:41.000 --> 05:43.000]  National's movements are exploding.
[05:43.000 --> 05:45.000]  Everybody needs to go pre-order.
[05:45.000 --> 05:47.000]  So you get it first at infowarsstore.com.
[05:47.000 --> 05:49.000]  The making of a president by Roger Stone.
[05:49.000 --> 05:50.000]  I'm Alex Jones.
[05:50.000 --> 05:53.000]  I'm going airplane to go to the inaugural event with Trump.
[05:53.000 --> 05:56.000]  Pray for us and please continue to support the operation and get his book.
[05:56.000 --> 06:04.000]  Now sir, the first to have a trip to you.
[06:04.000 --> 06:10.000]  Fear is the passion of slaves and this man knows no fear.
[06:10.000 --> 06:13.000]  He is Alex Jones.
[06:13.000 --> 06:17.000]  Now you can tell out of the hundreds of liners we have, I didn't write that one.
[06:17.000 --> 06:20.000]  Alex Jones is King Kong on steroids.
[06:20.000 --> 06:22.000]  Alex Jones to do anything.
[06:22.000 --> 06:28.000]  No, I fear failure. I fear the globalists having success over humanity.
[06:28.000 --> 06:30.000]  I fear that I'm not doing enough to fight them.
[06:30.000 --> 06:43.000]  That's why I'm pretty much up here seven days a week when I'm out with my family fighting the globalists because they're so easy to defeat when we simply stand up against them, when we simply block their agendas.
[06:43.000 --> 06:50.000]  First off, the traitorous, fake news, corporate-owned, globalist-owned media is lying about Trump's orders.
[06:50.000 --> 07:08.000]  We have a giant development where it's admitted that Trump only reissued an order that Obama put in in 2013 for a limited time on a travel ban when they knew a bunch of terrorists were getting on airplanes.
[07:08.000 --> 07:29.000]  So the big trolling of the media is they're all running around freaking out, pulling their hair out, going crazy because he's put a temporary ban on six countries and Obama three and a half years ago did the exact precise thing bigger than Dallas.
[07:29.000 --> 07:30.000]  Wow.
[07:30.000 --> 07:41.000]  By the way, there's a ban to most of those Muslim countries on Christians coming in or Jews or agnostics. Try going topless in more than 14 Muslim countries.
[07:41.000 --> 07:46.000]  They will cane you and torture you in the second offense. They will kill you.
[07:46.000 --> 08:00.000]  But I saw a video from the Women's March last week here in Austin and in D.C. where I was of topless women chanting Allah Akbar.
[08:00.000 --> 08:11.000]  Even the Herald Sun in Australia gets it right. Muslim ban hypocrisy left quiet when Obama also halts visas. This is crazy, but Trump is so smart.
[08:11.000 --> 08:19.000]  And I had to pick up on this till today. He issued, I'm going to show TV viewers, radio listeners, I'll break it down and give you the executive order numbers in a moment.
[08:19.000 --> 08:30.000]  He issued the exact text that Obama issued in 2013. He just changed the signature.
[08:30.000 --> 08:41.000]  If they were going, they would conniption fit and have corrupt pedophile Hollywood come out and bitching and playing about it and freak out.
[08:41.000 --> 08:49.000]  Now, some of the customs officials did overextended a bit in their hastiness to even stop folks that had green cards coming in.
[08:49.000 --> 08:58.000]  No, Trump clarified to me. He went, oh, a debacle. He's defeated. He's been discredited. Oh, why? He backed off on his own plan within two days.
[08:58.000 --> 09:03.000]  There was a little bit of the language. It was Obama's language. So he clarified that.
[09:03.000 --> 09:20.000]  So again, this is just craziness to watch all this unfold. We're going to break that down. We're going to break down the new mantra, the IMF, the World Bank, the central banks of Europe, the private Federal Reserve here.
[09:20.000 --> 09:28.000]  We're all announcing they want to raise interest rates to kill the Trump rally and 2.2 trillion out of the stock market.
[09:28.000 --> 09:40.000]  And all these factories coming back and optimism and restaurants being full again and suddenly all sorts of purchasing of textiles is up and people are having optimism and they're going out and getting loans for homes.
[09:40.000 --> 09:50.000]  Oh, no, no, no, we can't do that because Trump's a racist. A recession is overdue. Here's what will trigger it in BC. Oh, here's another headline.
[09:50.000 --> 10:01.000]  Trump will preside over the next recession. Strategist says, I mean, without looking, you type in Trump recession, you get thousands of articles the last week.
[10:01.000 --> 10:16.000]  Oh, the Trump processions here, doom and gloom. Oh my gosh. IMF, the Donald Trump boom is a bit of this and a bit of that for the U.S. economy.
[10:16.000 --> 10:23.000]  So we're going to be breaking all of this down. We're going to look at some of the big positive things. In fact, let's look at some of the promises delivered.
[10:23.000 --> 10:32.000]  There's been so many that I don't know where to start, but the latest today was another order, another executive order. Seven days a week you get this.
[10:32.000 --> 10:39.000]  I guess this is day nine. It's not quite over yet. A lifetime ban on foreign lobbying.
[10:39.000 --> 10:44.000]  Working for foreign governments. There's always be a ban in that. There's hell is a ban on the Constitution. That's reissued.
[10:44.000 --> 10:54.000]  And a five year on anybody that works in the government. Totally reasonable. And NBC has to admit Donald Trump, President Donald Trump, they hate that president couldn't happen.
[10:54.000 --> 11:08.000]  Impossible because they control the news. They're the fake news. President Donald Trump acted to fulfill a key portion of his pledge to drain the swamp in Washington banning administration officials from ever lobbying the U.S.
[11:08.000 --> 11:21.000]  Trump of foreign governments and opposing a separate five year ban on other lobbying. But there's the headline. President Donald Trump acted Saturday to fulfill a key portion of his pledge.
[11:21.000 --> 11:32.000]  Remember we had about a month ago creeping around. Duke Gennrich saying, oh, he's not going to drain the swamp. He's not going to ban lobbyists. Don't worry.
[11:32.000 --> 11:39.000]  Really, you little lobbyist, what happened? Your days of screwing everybody over or over. Your jobs are over.
[11:39.000 --> 11:44.000]  Like Trump said, a lot of people here in this room are going to have jobs after this when he signed it.
[11:44.000 --> 11:52.000]  Yesterday went into effect today for Monday. So let's play a clip here from NBC who actually was telling the truth here for once.
[11:52.000 --> 12:03.000]  Wow, he is fulfilling a pledge. That's the first thing he started doing with Pence was just anybody that had been in his campaign. He said, I'm sorry, you helped us get elected, but your lobbyist, bye-bye.
[12:03.000 --> 12:10.000]  He doesn't need the money. He doesn't want the money. He isn't even talking to all these interests that are promising him all these jobs, all these things later.
[12:10.000 --> 12:17.000]  He spent hundreds of millions of his own money to get elected. And I tell the truth, folks. And Trump's delivering.
[12:17.000 --> 12:22.000]  So here it is. Trump sets five-year and lifetime lobbying ban in NBC.
[12:22.000 --> 12:38.000]  So this is a five-year lobbying ban. And this is all of the people, most of the people standing behind me will not be able to go to work or do anything adverse to our wonderful country.
[12:38.000 --> 12:49.000]  Okay, five-year ban. It's a two-year ban now and it's got full of loopholes. This is a five-year ban. So you have one last chance to get out.
[12:49.000 --> 12:59.000]  Good. I had a feeling you were going to say that.
[12:59.000 --> 13:07.000]  This was something, a five-year ban that I've been talking about a lot on the campaign trail and we are now putting it into effect.
[13:07.000 --> 13:14.000]  By the way, they've had all these handwriting analysis people look at a signature. They say, somebody you can trust, somebody that's into stability.
[13:14.000 --> 13:21.000]  Notice it's like a expansion bridge, like the Golden Gate. It's three spikes, three pentacles with just a perfect road across it.
[13:21.000 --> 13:24.000]  Again, Trump obsessed with actually delivering.
[13:24.000 --> 13:26.000]  The organization of the National Security Council.
[13:26.000 --> 13:27.000]  Oh, what he says he'll do.
[13:27.000 --> 13:33.000]  The Homeland Security Council, you know, pretty much what it represents a lot.
[13:33.000 --> 13:43.000]  But more than that, it's a trifecta. He has the legislative, the executive, the judicial. The trifecta and his signature is a trifecta.
[13:43.000 --> 13:51.000]  This is just more insane by the moment. The trifecta signature.
[13:51.000 --> 13:56.000]  Boom. Boom.
[13:56.000 --> 14:04.000]  Meanwhile, the enemy is incomplete in saying asylum meltdown and coming up in the next segment, how long is the next segment?
[14:04.000 --> 14:06.000]  I don't have time to play that special report.
[14:06.000 --> 14:09.000]  I do.
[14:09.000 --> 14:14.000]  Coming up in the next segment, I'm going to play Rob do special report.
[14:14.000 --> 14:17.000]  I'm going to premiere it here on the radio slash TV.
[14:17.000 --> 14:34.000]  And I'm going to go over the facts after that that it's worse than we said. I've added the numbers together, conservatively 7 million on the high end 14 million illegals and dead people voted in previous elections and even more in this one.
[14:34.000 --> 14:46.000]  And the Democrats put out strategy papers a year ago saying, don't worry, we're going to win because of the electoral college just counts the general population.
[14:46.000 --> 14:55.000]  It just counts who's in the state. So then you get numbers for voters, not just for who votes, but for whoever's in the state is counted as votes.
[14:55.000 --> 15:01.000]  That's what's so fair about the electoral college. It just counts population. And even if you don't vote, you're still getting represented.
[15:01.000 --> 15:16.000]  And so in the system where you win or lose, Hillary totally regged it and bragged we have the electoral college because of New York, Florida, California and other states where Democrats have been dominating recently.
[15:16.000 --> 15:28.000]  They said we're going to be invincible because we have such a higher number of the electoral college because the illegals are counted in the census and Politico and the Associated Press and others a year and a half ago a year ago have the articles.
[15:28.000 --> 15:36.000]  I'm going to show them to you admitted that. And so we're talking about you had people voting illegally in this together. It's like at least 10 million.
[15:36.000 --> 15:45.000]  It could be 14 million. The lowest 7 million. So his number of 3 million is very reasonable. And then I've got all these studies that haven't even been in the news.
[15:45.000 --> 15:52.000]  They're talking about Pew trying to discredit that when it's one of the most credible groups out there. Problem is Pew gets government funding. They're really threatening them right now.
[15:52.000 --> 15:58.000]  Trump's about to clean that out. So the dawn is coming. It looks like. So stay with us.
[16:23.000 --> 16:34.000]  Deep Cleanse doesn't hold back. Instead of buying five, six or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades old scientific research that puts together the Rolls Royce of all in one cleansing.

[17:03.000 --> 17:14.000]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium and just recently we were able to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[17:14.000 --> 17:23.000]  With selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body. It helps balance the thyroid gland. It helps detoxify.
[17:23.000 --> 17:26.000]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[17:26.000 --> 17:37.000]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body. As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[17:37.000 --> 17:42.000]  So it really is a all around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[17:42.000 --> 17:49.000]  I'm taking it now every day. This is so key. BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[17:49.000 --> 17:51.000]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.

[17:57.000 --> 18:05.000]  It's not just our water we need to filter. It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned. It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[18:05.000 --> 18:12.000]  The artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[18:12.000 --> 18:21.000]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[18:21.000 --> 18:28.000]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children, to the best job you can to purify your air.
[18:28.000 --> 18:36.000]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most toxic effects for themselves.
[18:36.000 --> 18:38.000]  The general public doesn't.
[18:38.000 --> 18:42.000]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[18:42.000 --> 18:46.000]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[18:46.000 --> 18:52.000]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[18:52.000 --> 18:59.000]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today and then fullwarstore.com.
[18:59.000 --> 19:06.000]  This is Alex Jones. I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off the grid products of 2017.
[19:06.000 --> 19:09.000]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[19:09.000 --> 19:15.000]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[19:15.000 --> 19:21.000]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful you can run some 110 appliances at your house.
[19:21.000 --> 19:24.000]  Like a small refrigerator so you can keep food from spoiling.
[19:24.000 --> 19:30.000]  Plus, you can take it with you to jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.
[19:30.000 --> 19:37.000]  The system provides an endless supply of off the grid electricity, allowing you to create your own private power grid, literally anywhere in the world.
[19:37.000 --> 19:42.000]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, any time you need to get off the grid for a while.
[19:42.000 --> 19:53.000]  Go to privatepowergrid.com to watch this thing in action. That's privatepowergrid.com. Even better, use coupon code private at checkout and get a second PPX energy unit for free.
[19:53.000 --> 20:19.000]  Check it out at privatepowergrid.com. That's privatepowergrid.com.
[20:19.000 --> 20:26.000]  Here's the bottom line. Select multinational corporations, not all of them, set out to establish a world government.
[20:26.000 --> 20:35.000]  They wrote thousands of books, tens of thousands of white papers, spent hundreds of billions of dollars of taxpayer money, conservatively, to try to set this plan up.
[20:35.000 --> 20:42.000]  The big robber barons that controlled the U.S. at the start of the last century developed this program with what was left to the British Empire.
[20:42.000 --> 20:51.000]  And now that program kind of ran on by itself and was doing horrible things, was arrogant, was delusional, believed it was invincible.
[20:51.000 --> 20:58.000]  Mainly because most of the people that were running it had been given it via hereditary title. They weren't actually hardworking good people.
[20:58.000 --> 21:03.000]  They were decadent, they were disconnected. A lot of their mid-level people were patriots, didn't like what was happening.
[21:03.000 --> 21:09.000]  We built the movement, Liberty Movement built a major defense against it. It blew up in their face.
[21:09.000 --> 21:20.000]  Now they're hoping to basically overrun first world countries with third world populations who they can convert to globalism and then basically vote to take the rights of the indigenous populations.
[21:20.000 --> 21:23.000]  But instead, we're actually going to reach out to those people and educate them.
[21:23.000 --> 21:33.000]  Now, Rob Do has done a special report detailing the fact that Donald Trump is totally correct about systemic election fraud by organizing retail voter fraud.
[21:33.000 --> 21:37.000]  And Donald Trump is completely right. Here is that special report.
[21:37.000 --> 21:46.000]  The president does believe that. He has stated that before. I think he stated his concerns of voter fraud and people voting illegally during the campaign.
[21:46.000 --> 21:51.000]  And he continues to maintain that belief based on studies and evidence that people have presented to him.
[21:51.000 --> 21:55.000]  Our role is to be watchdogs and we have to provide that kind of accountability.
[21:55.000 --> 22:03.000]  I think when a president or anybody else says something that is empirically false, then one has to call him out on it.
[22:03.000 --> 22:12.000]  My name is Brittany Forman. I work in the 52nd ward, the 15th division, and today I witness voter fraud.
[22:12.000 --> 22:16.000]  It's tough to call the president of the United States a liar because you want to respect the office.
[22:16.000 --> 22:24.000]  But I think it does a disservice to the president and even to the president and even to journalists.
[22:24.000 --> 22:27.000]  Not to call. Call it what it is and it is a lie.
[22:27.000 --> 22:33.000]  Election judges confirmed there were issues with two of the eight automated voting machines in the Clinton Township building.
[22:33.000 --> 22:37.000]  Most of the issues stem from people trying to vote straight party ticket.
[22:37.000 --> 22:43.000]  However, a number of voters told me that specifically they wanted to vote for the Republican Donald Trump,
[22:43.000 --> 22:48.000]  only to see their votes switched before their eyes to the Democrat Hillary Clinton.
[22:48.000 --> 22:56.000]  Because he's trying to legitimize his election, is it because down the road Democrats are fearful that this might lead to voter suppression?
[22:56.000 --> 23:06.000]  Efforts by the Republican administration keeping people from being able to vote in the future by requiring certain identity documents that a lot of people just don't have.
[23:06.000 --> 23:11.000]  Like according to Joe DeFelice, the chairman of the Philadelphia Republican Party, you guys are saying that may be happening, is that correct?
[23:11.000 --> 23:15.000]  Oh, it's happening. Everything they said we were going to do, they're actually doing.
[23:15.000 --> 23:18.000]  They're intimidating, they're suppressing, they're disenfranchising, it's getting ridiculous.
[23:18.000 --> 23:26.000]  People in both parties and independents as well should want fair elections, they want every vote counted.
[23:26.000 --> 23:49.000]  Democrats want to steal this country, it ain't happening.
[23:49.000 --> 23:50.000]  Washington Post.
[23:50.000 --> 23:56.000]  Trump seeks major investigation into unsupported claims of voter fraud. USA Today. Fact check.
[23:56.000 --> 23:59.000]  Trump claims massive voter fraud. Here's the truth.
[23:59.000 --> 24:03.000]  And finally from Politico, Trump's bad voter fraud math.
[24:03.000 --> 24:09.000]  Now this is the same Politico that back in 2015 said how illegal immigrants could elect Hillary.
[24:09.000 --> 24:13.000]  And what are they talking about? Are they talking about illegal immigrants voting illegally?
[24:13.000 --> 24:20.000]  No, what they're talking about is illegal immigrants going into states and changing the way the Electoral College is appropriated.
[24:20.000 --> 24:32.000]  Thanks to the unique math undergirding the Electoral College, the mere presence of 11 to 12 million illegal immigrants and other non-citizens here legally may enable them to swing the election from Republicans to Democrats.
[24:32.000 --> 24:45.000]  In fact, there are 435 electoral seats that are reappropriated every 10 years due to the census. So if you have a massive wave of illegal immigrants, they could tip the scales into the favor of the Democrats.
[24:45.000 --> 24:55.000]  And these findings are echoed by a study from Old Dominion in George Mason University done back in 2014 titled, Do Non-Citizens Vote in US Elections?
[24:55.000 --> 25:06.000]  The highlights include first use of a representative sample to measure non-citizen voting in the USA. They also found that some non-citizens cast votes in US elections despite legal bans.
[25:06.000 --> 25:10.000]  They also found that non-citizens favored Democratic candidates over Republicans.
[25:10.000 --> 25:18.000]  And they found that non-citizens likely changed the 2008 outcomes including the Electoral College votes and the composition of Congress.
[25:18.000 --> 25:24.000]  They also said that voter photo identification rules have limited effect on non-citizen voter participation.
[25:24.000 --> 25:37.000]  And specifically in the study, the authors say that illegals may have cast as many as 2.8 million votes in 2008 and 2010, which is the same number of votes that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by in this past election.
[25:37.000 --> 25:43.000]  So it really makes you wonder, is Donald Trump full of bunk when he says we need to do an investigation into this or is there something behind it?
[25:43.000 --> 25:51.000]  Well, the mainstream media wants you to think that voter fraud has never occurred in this country ever, but now I'm going to go into some instances that happened just in this past election.
[25:51.000 --> 25:55.000]  So there's a checklist on whether or not a precinct can be unrecountable.
[25:55.000 --> 26:03.000]  If there is a large tear in the ballot container that would allow ballots to be removed or ballots to be put in, that potentially could deem a precinct unrecountable.
[26:03.000 --> 26:16.000]  If the seal on the precinct, excuse me, if the seal on the ballot container back doesn't match the seal number written in the poll book, that could potentially be a cause for an unrecountable precinct as well.
[26:16.000 --> 26:32.000]  Half of Detroit votes may be ineligible for recount. Michigan's largest county voted overwhelmingly for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, but officials couldn't reconcile vote totals for 610 of the 1680 precincts during a county-wide canvas of vote results last month.
[26:32.000 --> 26:39.000]  That's right, and this was one of the states where Jill Stein was trying to have a recount, and notice that recount in that state got quashed.
[26:39.000 --> 26:49.000]  Furthermore, in heavily Democratic Detroit, it was found that 59% of the precinct poll books did not match those of the voting machine printouts.
[26:49.000 --> 26:53.000]  That's 392 precincts out of 662.
[26:53.000 --> 26:55.000]  Now let's move over to PA.
[26:55.000 --> 26:58.000]  Where just yesterday a spokesman for the State Department there said,
[26:58.000 --> 27:04.000]  We have no evidence at all of voter fraud. There is no evidence that undocumented immigrants voted in November.
[27:04.000 --> 27:13.000]  But earlier this month, the Secretary of State said, We had up to 700 voters that may have cast two ballots in different counties in this election.
[27:13.000 --> 27:24.000]  In fact, the Secretary of State, Carol Ashile, was quoted as saying, There's potential for voter fraud in Pennsylvania, and added, She's powerless to investigate or prosecute double voters.
[27:24.000 --> 27:34.000]  And back during Election Day, Philadelphia GOP member Brittany Foreman said, She witnessed voter fraud. She witnessed people trying to tell people how to vote in Philadelphia.
[27:34.000 --> 27:42.000]  And in early November, state police raided the offices of Delco to seek evidence of voter registration fraud, and that's in Delaware County, Pennsylvania.
[27:42.000 --> 27:47.000]  Again, another swing state where the vote counts were stopped.
[27:47.000 --> 27:52.000]  You see how this is happening? Anywhere where there might be voter fraud or widespread voter fraud, the recounts were stopped.
[27:52.000 --> 27:56.000]  Now, there were only recounts in three states, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania.
[27:56.000 --> 28:07.000]  But there were other states that were reporting hacks to their voter registration systems, one of which was Georgia, and the IP address of the computer that was attacking them led back to DHS.
[28:07.000 --> 28:11.000]  Now, when DHS was questioned about this, they said, Well, it might be a rogue employee. We don't know.
[28:11.000 --> 28:20.000]  And then when the head of elections at Georgia, Canvas, other states, they found at least five other states were getting pings from the Department of Homeland Security.
[28:20.000 --> 28:26.000]  And then we had Obama, as he was walking out the door, wanting to put Homeland Security in charge of our election systems.
[28:26.000 --> 28:32.000]  And finally, from the Daily Caller back in October, here's what voter fraud looks like in 23 states.
[28:32.000 --> 28:39.000]  And they highlight cases in Virginia, Colorado, Michigan, and California, and 19 other states.
[28:39.000 --> 28:44.000]  So voter fraud is real, and I commend the president for wanting to do an investigation on it.
[28:44.000 --> 28:49.000]  And the mainstream media needs to get out of the way and shut up until we see what the findings are.
[28:49.000 --> 28:53.000]  This has been Rob Dew reporting for Infowars.com and Infowars Nightly News.
[28:53.000 --> 28:58.000]  And look, the truth is they know the findings. Democrats plan the whole thing.
[28:58.000 --> 29:06.000]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality Infowars biome defense probiotic.
[29:06.000 --> 29:20.000]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.

[31:23.000 --> 31:29.000]  You said when you talk to people that have been using this actually testing it for years, and people that currently are testing it for us, they didn't just say outstanding.
[31:29.000 --> 31:30.000]  What did they really say about them?
[31:30.000 --> 31:33.000]  They want to know how do they get it, where do they find it.
[31:33.000 --> 31:37.000]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing.
[31:37.000 --> 31:41.000]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[31:41.000 --> 31:46.000]  I mean it's unbelievable, it's a quarter inch thick, it's got a 20 year warranty, it's waterproof, you can wear it, it's comfortable.

[33:28.000 --> 33:32.000]  Waging war on corruption, I intend to open the phones up in the second hour.
[33:32.000 --> 33:40.000]  We have a bunch of special reports I haven't gotten to, but I was just thinking, why did you vote for Trump?
[33:40.000 --> 33:46.000]  And what do you think of him delivering in eight and a half days on half of his agenda,
[33:46.000 --> 33:48.000]  at least executing to move forward with it?
[33:48.000 --> 33:51.000]  It's so unprecedented even in history.
[33:51.000 --> 33:56.000]  Even with other leaders that do what they say they do, it takes some time.
[33:56.000 --> 33:59.000]  This is beyond Blitzkrieg.
[33:59.000 --> 34:07.000]  This is amazing and CNN says it's like he's obsessed with delivering on his promises.
[34:07.000 --> 34:15.000]  Yes, this is leadership and you compare it to Obama who vacationed four or five months a year.
[34:15.000 --> 34:21.000]  It's a totally different ballgame, isn't it?
[34:21.000 --> 34:23.000]  You know, I don't have George Soros funding.
[34:23.000 --> 34:25.000]  I don't have big corporate sponsors.
[34:25.000 --> 34:30.000]  I have viewers and listeners that support info wars.
[34:30.000 --> 34:39.000]  And just like our information is game changing, cutting edge, tip of the spear, spearhead, powerful, because we're telling the truth.
[34:39.000 --> 34:52.000]  The products I sell are things I personally research, I personally use that we scour the world for what's the best for ourselves and our families, our communities, and what's the best to sell to you at the lowest price.
[34:52.000 --> 34:54.000]  It's really a simple idea.
[34:54.000 --> 34:57.000]  Do unto others as you'd have them do unto you.
[34:57.000 --> 35:15.000]  And whether it's non-GMO, heirloom seeds that are great to order right now with the spring coming up, whether it's water purification, home air purifiers, or whether it's Defense Department Combat 1 that only is available to info wars, customers right now will be in stores nationwide within six months.
[35:15.000 --> 35:16.000]  You'll see it everywhere.
[35:16.000 --> 35:18.000]  It's got a whole new system beyond Coil Silver.
[35:18.000 --> 35:20.000]  Coil Silver is great beyond antibiotics.
[35:20.000 --> 35:24.000]  It's been proven by the Defense Department with patented technology to kill germs safely.
[35:24.000 --> 35:26.000]  It's got things nobody's got.
[35:26.000 --> 35:31.000]  We've got the field spray, the wipes, everything, and it's like cheaper than baby wipes, and it's 10 times better.
[35:31.000 --> 35:32.000]  That's all available.
[35:32.000 --> 35:37.000]  We've got lowers from Tennessee Arms, the lowest price with the brass inserts.
[35:37.000 --> 35:47.000]  But the point is, is that just as we game change in politics and in world systems, we game change in the products we bring you to fund our operation.
[35:47.000 --> 36:00.000]  And you game change when you go check out the products, we've got thousands of them that everybody needs, and support people that are behind you and behind your family and behind literally being suicidal when it comes to taking on the globalist.
[36:00.000 --> 36:03.000]  I don't mean that as in suicidal, the technical sense.
[36:03.000 --> 36:04.000]  I love life.
[36:04.000 --> 36:06.000]  I want to live to be 150 years old.
[36:06.000 --> 36:07.000]  I don't ever want to die.
[36:07.000 --> 36:09.000]  I want to have great, great grandchildren, I see.
[36:09.000 --> 36:10.000]  But you know what?
[36:10.000 --> 36:13.000]  Put a gun to my head and say, sell somebody out.
[36:13.000 --> 36:14.000]  I say, pull the trigger.
[36:14.000 --> 36:17.000]  I will never submit or give in.
[36:17.000 --> 36:19.000]  We're the people to bet on.
[36:19.000 --> 36:20.000]  We're the people to support.
[36:20.000 --> 36:24.000]  But beyond buying our products, I want your prayers.
[36:24.000 --> 36:31.000]  I want you, when you look up the stars at night and pray for your family to think about me, because I am your family and I love you and I need you.
[36:31.000 --> 36:33.000]  We all need each other in this fight.
[36:33.000 --> 36:38.000]  We always root for the folks that stand up for what's good and try to help people, don't we?
[36:38.000 --> 36:44.000]  There's a bunch of people think we're weak because we care about the little guy, because we don't want senseless wars.
[36:44.000 --> 36:48.000]  But we're willing to go to war to stand up for what we believe in.
[36:48.000 --> 36:49.000]  And I'll quote Merle Haggard.
[36:49.000 --> 36:54.000]  I don't blame somebody for picking sides and seeing enough what they believe in.
[36:54.000 --> 37:02.000]  But when you sit here and you run down what I stand for and claim I'm some type of degenerate, for what I believe in, you're walking on the fighting side of me.
[37:02.000 --> 37:04.000]  That's what M4 Wars is in 21 years.
[37:04.000 --> 37:07.000]  You're walking on the fighting side of Alex Jones and you've got to fight.
[37:07.000 --> 37:09.000]  You want to fight, you've got one.
[37:09.000 --> 37:19.000]  All I am is an electrical charge reaching out to you that feels the same way, who has the same background, the same historical experiences.
[37:19.000 --> 37:20.000]  I don't care what color you are.
[37:20.000 --> 37:21.000]  It's the American experience.
[37:21.000 --> 37:26.000]  We've all been through it together and it's spiritual.
[37:26.000 --> 37:28.000]  I want to launch a D.C. Bureau.
[37:28.000 --> 37:29.000]  I want to launch a London Bureau.
[37:29.000 --> 37:31.000]  I want to launch a New York Bureau and LA Bureau.
[37:31.000 --> 37:32.000]  I want to take the culture back.
[37:32.000 --> 37:33.000]  I got plans.
[37:33.000 --> 37:35.000]  You think what we've done has been powerful so far.
[37:35.000 --> 37:41.000]  I know that if we implement these plans, it will change the world.
[37:41.000 --> 37:43.000]  Now, does it put me into greater danger?
[37:43.000 --> 37:45.000]  Absolutely.
[37:45.000 --> 37:46.000]  That's why I go there.
[37:46.000 --> 37:50.000]  I go towards the enemy attack, just like World War II.
[37:50.000 --> 37:52.000]  They didn't have good radar.
[37:52.000 --> 37:54.000]  They didn't have GPS.
[37:54.000 --> 37:55.000]  They didn't have any of that.
[37:55.000 --> 37:56.000]  They had charts and maps.
[37:56.000 --> 38:07.000]  They'd be going in to try to bomb a little bitty factory.
[38:07.000 --> 38:09.000]  Sometimes your mission is to have the wind in your face.
[38:09.000 --> 38:11.000]  You're not going to have gas to get back.
[38:11.000 --> 38:12.000]  You've got order to go there.
[38:12.000 --> 38:18.000]  You're going to bomb these targets and get your planes in the ocean.
[38:18.000 --> 38:21.000]  Imagine you're flying and you're looking at the binoculars.
[38:21.000 --> 38:23.000]  You're looking at night for fires.
[38:23.000 --> 38:24.000]  There it is.
[38:24.000 --> 38:25.000]  There's the flag.
[38:25.000 --> 38:29.000]  They've got the shells, and you steer right towards the enemy attack.
[38:29.000 --> 38:32.000]  You go right to the attack.
[38:32.000 --> 38:40.000]  Because their fight against us is our guidance system to where we've got to drop the munitions.
[38:40.000 --> 38:41.000]  We're running a special.
[38:41.000 --> 38:43.000]  It's going to end in just a few days.
[38:43.000 --> 38:47.000]  We have it with a manufacturer of Alexa Pure water filtration systems that cut all the garbage out,
[38:47.000 --> 38:51.000]  and the Alexa Pure Breeze amazing air filtration systems.
[38:51.000 --> 38:55.000]  They're like 250 bucks, well, 20% off.
[38:55.000 --> 38:56.000]  It's way below that.
[38:56.000 --> 39:00.000]  It's $149, leading steps of $500.
[39:00.000 --> 39:07.000]  Now, with miniaturization and cost going down, I bought stuff like four years ago that was $800 to $1,000 for my house, similar system.
[39:07.000 --> 39:09.000]  They just learned how to miniaturize it and make it better.
[39:09.000 --> 39:13.000]  It's not miniaturizing, but each little cell is miniaturized.
[39:13.000 --> 39:15.000]  It's really a great deal, $149.
[39:15.000 --> 39:25.000]  And your purchase funds are operation infowarstore.com or call toll free, triple eight, 253-33139, triple eight, 253-33139.
[39:25.000 --> 39:27.000]  A lot of other specials are running right now as well.
[39:27.000 --> 39:28.000]  10% off DNA force.
[39:28.000 --> 39:30.000]  Supermail vitality is about to sell out.
[39:30.000 --> 39:35.000]  But again, these are all products that I personally use and know are simply fabulous.
[39:35.000 --> 39:41.000]  You know, I'm not ready yet to get into more proof of the election fraud, backing up what Trump said.
[39:41.000 --> 39:44.000]  I want to cover that in the next segment, plus their attempts to implode the economy.
[39:44.000 --> 39:50.000]  I want to air a John Bowne report because I love the people of Mexico or anywhere else.
[39:50.000 --> 40:00.000]  I love empowering people and what Trump is doing will empower everybody if the dream of free market, open free societies is actually realized.
[40:00.000 --> 40:05.000]  So there's a report here, Mexico our neighbor under economic tyranny by John Bowne.
[40:05.000 --> 40:07.000]  We're going to go to break here just about three minutes.
[40:07.000 --> 40:10.000]  I don't have time to get to that.
[40:10.000 --> 40:11.000]  Man, I want to get to that.
[40:11.000 --> 40:15.000]  We're going to play that when we come back.
[40:15.000 --> 40:19.000]  Do what?
[40:19.000 --> 40:21.000]  Okay, we have time for which report?
[40:21.000 --> 40:23.000]  Oh, yeah, the black conservative report.
[40:23.000 --> 40:26.000]  This guy's powerful at the women's march when they're attacking white people.
[40:26.000 --> 40:29.000]  He says, you're just acting like the enemy, like the KKK.
[40:29.000 --> 40:32.000]  Let's go out to break with this report.
[40:32.000 --> 40:34.000]  No, no, no, I haven't been practicing.
[40:34.000 --> 40:35.000]  This is what I live.
[40:35.000 --> 40:36.000]  This is what I breathe.
[40:36.000 --> 40:41.000]  There's a woman in front of him saying, lock him up.
[40:41.000 --> 40:45.000]  You allow Black Lives Matter on campus, but you don't allow white power on campus.
[40:45.000 --> 40:46.000]  Why not?
[40:46.000 --> 40:47.000]  It's the same ****.
[40:47.000 --> 40:50.000]  We both are hate group and neither are conductors.
[40:50.000 --> 40:53.000]  So if you denounce one, then denounce the other.
[40:53.000 --> 40:58.000]  It's the black guy telling the white woman Black Lives Matter racist.
[40:58.000 --> 40:59.000]  I'm being honest with you, bro.
[40:59.000 --> 41:00.000]  I'm being honest with you.
[41:00.000 --> 41:01.000]  Because you don't know what to say.
[41:01.000 --> 41:02.000]  Let me tell you something.
[41:02.000 --> 41:06.000]  Let me be honest with you.
[41:06.000 --> 41:10.000]  I want to tell you something right now.
[41:10.000 --> 41:16.000]  African Americans make up 13% of the population, yet commit over 50% of the violent gun and
[41:16.000 --> 41:18.000]  drug crime in the United States.
[41:18.000 --> 41:20.000]  And you don't think there's a problem with this?
[41:20.000 --> 41:21.000]  No, no, that's true.
[41:21.000 --> 41:22.000]  It's 55%.
[41:22.000 --> 41:24.000]  And if you love black folks, you want to face that?
[41:24.000 --> 41:25.000]  That's 55% of that.
[41:25.000 --> 41:26.000]  It's the other black.
[41:26.000 --> 41:27.000]  So here's an African American.
[41:27.000 --> 41:33.000]  I have a 2,000 time more likelihood to be shot and killed by another black man.
[41:33.000 --> 41:34.000]  That's right.
[41:34.000 --> 41:35.000]  Or leaving this event that I do by a white racist.
[41:35.000 --> 41:38.000]  They want to abort black people or shoot them.
[41:38.000 --> 41:39.000]  So you don't think that's a problem?
[41:39.000 --> 41:40.000]  2,000 times more percent.
[41:40.000 --> 41:42.000]  I mean, they're killing us as African Americans.
[41:42.000 --> 41:43.000]  We're killing each other.
[41:43.000 --> 41:45.000]  That's what the real **** problem is.
[41:45.000 --> 41:47.000]  Yo, this is a reverse mirror.
[41:47.000 --> 41:48.000]  I'm being honest with you.
[41:48.000 --> 41:49.000]  That's what the problem is.
[41:49.000 --> 41:50.000]  That's what the problem is.
[41:50.000 --> 41:51.000]  That's what the problem is.
[41:51.000 --> 41:52.000]  That's what the problem is.
[41:52.000 --> 41:53.000]  That's what the problem is.
[41:53.000 --> 41:54.000]  That's what the problem is.
[41:54.000 --> 41:55.000]  That's what the problem is.
[41:55.000 --> 41:56.000]  That's what the problem is.
[41:56.000 --> 41:57.000]  I'm being honest.
[41:57.000 --> 41:59.000]  If Obama would have stood up and said, look, we're killing each other.
[41:59.000 --> 42:02.000]  We've got a problem within the African American community.
[42:02.000 --> 42:03.000]  He would have been phenomenal.
[42:03.000 --> 42:06.000]  But he's going to make it white people.
[42:06.000 --> 42:08.000]  We hired Owen Stroyer.
[42:08.000 --> 42:09.000]  I want to find this guy.
[42:09.000 --> 42:10.000]  I want to hire him.
[42:10.000 --> 42:11.000]  Either where he's at.
[42:11.000 --> 42:15.000]  I'm 2,000 times more likely to be shot and killed by another black man.
[42:15.000 --> 42:17.000]  Leaving this event today, tonight.
[42:17.000 --> 42:19.000]  And they'll call this guy up on top.
[42:19.000 --> 42:21.000]  No, he cares about black people.
[42:21.000 --> 42:22.000]  That's what the **** is.
[42:22.000 --> 42:23.000]  That's what's killing black people.
[42:23.000 --> 42:24.000]  That's sad.
[42:24.000 --> 42:27.000]  I can't even, I can't, I can't hang out in black neighborhoods.
[42:27.000 --> 42:29.000]  I can't, I can't, I can't do that.
[42:29.000 --> 42:32.000]  I can't, I can't because it's a risk for me.
[42:32.000 --> 42:33.000]  It's a risk.
[42:33.000 --> 42:34.000]  It's sad.
[42:34.000 --> 42:36.000]  There's a problem within the African American community.
[42:36.000 --> 42:37.000]  This guy escaped the right one.
[42:37.000 --> 42:39.000]  I want this guy's work order right now.
[42:39.000 --> 42:40.000]  Obama didn't address it because he wanted to black vote.
[42:40.000 --> 42:41.000]  Did he reach out and find this guy?
[42:41.000 --> 42:45.000]  And Al Sharpe didn't address it because he's making millions of dollars off of victimizing
[42:45.000 --> 42:46.000]  African Americans.
[42:46.000 --> 42:47.000]  Trust me.
[42:47.000 --> 42:48.000]  Trust me.
[42:48.000 --> 42:49.000]  I know how that is.
[42:49.000 --> 42:54.000]  A thousand dollar bounty for whoever finds out of that guy is I want him.
[42:54.000 --> 42:55.000]  It's like Owen Shroyer.
[42:55.000 --> 42:58.000]  Not because he's black or white because he's super smart.
[42:58.000 --> 43:27.000]  That's sad.
[43:27.000 --> 43:28.000]  This is again.
[43:28.000 --> 43:32.000]  Voter fraud proven to be happening, another independent study has found, stacked that
[43:32.000 --> 43:37.540]  up with independent CBS investigation, the Federalist John Gibbs investigation, a compilation
[43:37.540 --> 43:42.000]  of documented voter fraud at DiscoverTheNetworks.org, and more to come, I'm sure.
[43:42.000 --> 43:47.440]  Remember, just yesterday, CNN, USA Today, and other mainstream media outlets claimed Trump's
[43:47.440 --> 43:51.880]  claim of voter fraud was debunked.
[43:51.880 --> 43:54.400]  Even factcheck.org said it wasn't true.
[43:54.400 --> 43:58.400]  This is Owen Shroyer for Infowars.com.

[50:43.720 --> 50:49.080]  but I can't stand it. You know, it's TV shows, it's pomp, all he's doing. That was all camouflaging
[50:49.080 --> 50:53.160]  at the systems and not recognizing. He knows exactly what he's doing. And then as, as,
[50:53.160 --> 50:57.320]  as he began to move, and I just knew he would deliver and he would do it all. But
[50:58.040 --> 51:02.600]  that's only because the big attacks coming. Let me tell you, we think we're having this big
[51:02.600 --> 51:09.320]  victory right now. Oh, we're kicking ass and ha, ha, ha. This was all just round one, man,
[51:09.320 --> 51:18.440]  that coming out of the sea is Leviathan and plagues, GMO gone awry, economic collapse.
[51:18.440 --> 51:24.360]  This is just God giving his people that kept crying out for defense and, and for renaissance
[51:24.360 --> 51:30.840]  and for revival, a chance to get ready. That's all this is. You, you can make, whether it's
[51:30.840 --> 51:36.920]  five years from now or six months from now or 10 years from now or 50, my spirit, my gut, my intellect
[51:36.920 --> 51:43.160]  can see it. I've looked into the enemy's eyes. I've had them try to buy me off. I've, I've been
[51:43.160 --> 51:50.520]  there and they want our souls. It's like that little promo piece we have. We want your souls.
[51:50.520 --> 51:55.320]  It's not about this third dimension. It's not about crap or Lamborghinis or looking tough or
[51:55.320 --> 51:59.240]  looking cool or, you know, once you have real success, you learn, you don't even want it to
[51:59.240 --> 52:04.680]  be seen. It's, it's about your soul. It's about where your soul's pointed. And let me tell you,
[52:04.680 --> 52:10.200]  you better get it pointed towards God and justice and Jesus Christ and his father and the Holy Ghost
[52:10.200 --> 52:13.000]  and the whole nine yards because this whole thing's real.
[52:15.720 --> 52:20.680]  There's a war inside the Catholic church right now. Even the New York Times admits it right here
[52:20.680 --> 52:25.000]  where they say the whole Catholic church is trying to bring down the new pope. This guy's in him.
[52:25.000 --> 52:30.920]  I'm not even a Catholic. You can look at it as a total devil tiff between nights and pope turns
[52:30.920 --> 52:40.680]  into all out proxy war. Jason Horowitz. I mean, there's just wars at every level with a heart
[52:40.680 --> 52:48.280]  and soul of humanity taking place. It doesn't matter what institution it is within that institution,
[52:48.280 --> 52:54.920]  you can have a war for what's right. And right now is the side to choose for eternity.
[52:54.920 --> 53:02.040]  All of us that are alive, almost eight billion people are living in a very, very special time.
[53:05.480 --> 53:11.640]  And the spirit's real and people better get that straight. I love how
[53:13.640 --> 53:17.320]  you got 10 centuries later, the pope of nights to battle. I mean, my God,
[53:18.280 --> 53:21.720]  the current pope runs the pedophile rings that took over the Catholic church. I mean,
[53:21.720 --> 53:27.480]  the current pope is a giant satanic demon who wants world government and says Europe shouldn't
[53:27.480 --> 53:37.080]  be Christian. I mean, by his own words, he is abomination desolation. I don't say that without
[53:37.080 --> 53:42.440]  real reservation. He's dangerous. I was threatened in DC for being up against the pope by powerful
[53:42.440 --> 53:50.120]  people just a week and a half ago. And I said, I stand against him. You decide where you stand.
[53:50.120 --> 53:55.560]  But if that guy had the false prophet or a model of the one to come, I don't know what it is. He is
[53:55.560 --> 54:02.680]  a giant manifest devil, a destroyer. And thank God, the Catholic church is trying to throw him off.
[54:03.560 --> 54:06.760]  Let's go to this John Bown report, start the second hour with more news and I'll give the number
[54:06.760 --> 54:11.960]  out in your calls. Here's John Bown on a future for the golden, beautiful country and the shining,
[54:11.960 --> 54:19.160]  strong people that are Mexico under bondage. At the end of week one, as promised, President
[54:19.160 --> 54:25.960]  Donald Trump is easing into the advancement of US interests as a global model on foreign policy.
[54:25.960 --> 54:31.640]  Today, President Trump held a press conference with UK Prime Minister Theresa May. There are many
[54:31.640 --> 54:37.400]  issues on which the United Kingdom and the United States stand alongside one another. Many issues
[54:37.400 --> 54:42.920]  on which we agree. And I think, as I said yesterday in my speech, that we are at a moment now when
[54:42.920 --> 54:47.400]  we can build an even stronger special relationship, which will be in the interest not just of the
[54:47.400 --> 54:51.240]  UK and the United States, but actually in the interests of the wider world as well.
[54:52.040 --> 54:58.200]  President Trump has been very aggressive on his stance regarding immigration. Prime Minister May
[54:58.200 --> 55:03.880]  echoes Trump's position. A future that sees us take back control of the things that matter to us.
[55:04.440 --> 55:09.400]  Things like our national borders and immigration policy and the way we decide and interpret our
[55:09.400 --> 55:15.320]  own laws. So that we are able to shape a better, more prosperous future for the working men and
[55:15.320 --> 55:22.200]  women of Britain. In spite of this formation of excellent relations with the UK, our southern
[55:22.200 --> 55:28.200]  neighbor, Mexico, has been blindsided by President Trump's disgust. With the cozy,
[55:28.200 --> 55:33.480]  billion-dollar trade relations, Mexico has enjoyed for the past 25 years.
[55:33.480 --> 55:40.280]  MarketWatch reports after running a trade deficit with the US from 1991 to 1994,
[55:40.280 --> 55:47.960]  Mexico moved to a surplus in 1995, and that's been the case ever since. As a result, US imports
[55:47.960 --> 55:54.680]  from Mexico soared from $65 billion when the North American trade deal was passed to around
[55:54.680 --> 56:02.600]  $295 billion in 2016. However, the US has been helped too, especially in border states such as
[56:02.600 --> 56:11.240]  Texas. Exports to Mexico have climbed from $68 billion in 1994 to an estimated $235 billion
[56:11.240 --> 56:19.000]  in 2016. As Trump pointed out though, the US is on track to run a trade deficit of close to $60
[56:19.000 --> 56:27.320]  billion with Mexico in 2016. According to government data, that's about 12% of the nation's overall
[56:27.320 --> 56:34.200]  annual trade gap. In essence, this NAFTA transfer of wealth has benefited a small group of corrupt
[56:34.200 --> 56:40.360]  overlords, while the Bank of America launders cartel money and American industry is bled dry.
[56:40.360 --> 56:45.800]  After canceling a meeting with President Trump due to the outrage over Trump's insistence that the
[56:45.800 --> 56:52.120]  US border be protected, Mexican President Piña Nieto reportedly had a phone conversation with
[56:52.120 --> 56:58.280]  President Trump following the cancellation. I will say that we had a very good call. I have been
[56:58.280 --> 57:03.400]  very strong on Mexico, a great respect for Mexico, but it was a very very friendly call. I think
[57:03.400 --> 57:08.440]  you'll hear that from the president and I think you'll hear that from the people of Mexico and I
[57:08.440 --> 57:14.120]  look forward to over the coming months we'll be negotiating and we'll see what happens. But
[57:14.840 --> 57:21.720]  I'm representing the people of the United States and I'm going to represent them as somebody should
[57:21.720 --> 57:28.920]  represent them, not how they've been represented in the past where we lose to every single country.
[57:28.920 --> 57:35.160]  All right. Back that up. We're going to come back in 70 seconds with the start of the second hour,
[57:35.160 --> 57:39.240]  finish that up, get into all the other news, and open the phones up and take your calls.
[57:39.240 --> 57:46.360]  Spread the link, infowars.com. The enemy hates it, infowars.com. Remember, infowars.com.
[57:46.360 --> 57:51.320]  Not a group. You developed Living Defense for us. It took you over a year to do it.
[57:51.320 --> 57:56.680]  Why is this so good? Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares
[57:56.680 --> 58:02.440]  me the most. I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages
[58:02.440 --> 58:08.760]  in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful
[58:08.760 --> 58:14.600]  to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading disease
[58:14.600 --> 58:19.240]  around. We have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all parasites. Tell us
[58:19.240 --> 58:22.840]  about all the stuff I said. There's so many things that are in it. You have the neem in there. You
[58:22.840 --> 58:28.520]  have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood. I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least
[58:28.520 --> 58:32.280]  twice a year. All right. Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[58:32.280 --> 58:36.600]  It just came back in yesterday. Living Defense, infowarslife.com. And folks, you can't lose
[58:36.600 --> 58:42.280]  full of stuff that's great for your body, period. And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com.
[58:42.280 --> 58:45.880]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center. Thank you so much for all your work, sir,
[58:45.880 --> 58:52.200]  on this great product. You're investing in your health and supporting the info war. When you
[58:52.200 --> 58:57.640]  visit infowarslife.com and purchase your supply of survival shield X2 nascent iodine and all the
[58:57.640 --> 59:02.280]  great products, infowarslife.com. As you know, we've talked to pharmacists, chemists, doctors,
[59:02.280 --> 59:08.520]  researchers, scientists, and the answer is clear. Iodine is key, is paramount, and there's still
[59:08.520 --> 59:13.800]  so much new information coming out that we simply can't even keep up with it. In our quest for the
[59:13.800 --> 59:20.120]  purest iodine, we drill down more than 7,000 feet to gather these purple blue crystals to extract
[59:20.120 --> 59:25.560]  the ultra pure iodine. On top of that, we also screen our iodine for radiation before bottling.
[59:25.560 --> 59:30.600]  It is the purest, cleanest, strongest out there. Quite frankly, I'm flattered that with the launch
[59:30.600 --> 59:35.640]  of survival shield nascent iodine, that major brands and major companies have been knocking down
[59:35.640 --> 59:39.960]  our doors to get our formula and that they have been unable to come up with anything even close
[59:39.960 --> 59:48.360]  to what we have. It is exclusive to infowarslife.com and the info warslife family of incredible products.
[59:52.600 --> 59:55.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[59:55.240 --> 1:00:10.280]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[1:00:25.400 --> 1:00:34.200]  While populism and the excitement of writing all of the globalist wrongs done to the United States
[1:00:34.200 --> 1:00:40.200]  continue to push President Trump's approval ratings to 59% and beyond in the United States,
[1:00:40.200 --> 1:00:46.040]  Mexican President Peña Nieto's approval ratings are at a dismal 12% in Mexico.
[1:00:46.040 --> 1:00:52.280]  Nieto is regarded as yet another detached leader by the majority of Mexicans and why not?
[1:00:52.280 --> 1:00:58.120]  A recent 20% increase in gas prices, a huge burden to the Mexican people who have broken
[1:00:58.120 --> 1:01:03.640]  their backs to earn higher wages and hopes of supporting an infrastructure that is desperately
[1:01:03.640 --> 1:01:08.280]  needed, a better power grid, better water treatment facilities, better plumbing and
[1:01:08.280 --> 1:01:13.320]  end of the corruption and cartel violence that has terrorized Mexico for far too long,
[1:01:13.320 --> 1:01:21.320]  claiming the lives of at least 164,000 people between 2007 and 2014. A number that makes the
[1:01:21.320 --> 1:01:27.240]  wars in Afghanistan and Iraq look like a walk in the park. Where has all of the NAFTA surplus
[1:01:27.240 --> 1:01:53.240]  trade money gone? Apparently not into the pockets of the Mexican people.
[1:01:53.240 --> 1:01:57.640]  What do we do? There's all this wealth that America produces. It dominates the planet.
[1:01:57.640 --> 1:02:06.440]  In the 1957, the U.S. had half the world's wealth, actually like 57%. By the 70s, it was 47%. Now,
[1:02:06.440 --> 1:02:12.280]  it's like 30%. Now, how do they deal with it? They just siphon it off. They shut it down.
[1:02:12.280 --> 1:02:19.080]  Then they don't look so bad compared to it. I've been all over Mexico. It's more beautiful than
[1:02:19.080 --> 1:02:24.040]  many areas of the U.S. It has more oil, more resources per square mile. It's got hard work
[1:02:24.040 --> 1:02:29.480]  and smart people, but it never had a George Washington. Santa Ana was even more oppressive
[1:02:29.480 --> 1:02:36.920]  than the government he overthrew, the Spanish he overthrew. I mean, imagine, it's not knocking
[1:02:36.920 --> 1:02:41.800]  Mexico. Other countries never got out from under colonialism. Russia got out from under it,
[1:02:41.800 --> 1:02:45.400]  out from the czars, royalty, and got something 50 times worse. The communists,
[1:02:45.400 --> 1:02:51.720]  nobody ever got out from under it. But the United States, see, we're not perfect.
[1:02:53.800 --> 1:02:56.360]  But we had a system where we claimed we were for the individual,
[1:02:56.920 --> 1:03:00.600]  where we claimed we were for women, where we claimed, and people looked at what we said,
[1:03:00.600 --> 1:03:05.560]  we were for them. They went, I want that promise. I want what you say you're going to do. I believe
[1:03:05.560 --> 1:03:10.680]  in that. And it's that idea that the world government hates. Hell, America's got so many sins
[1:03:10.680 --> 1:03:17.240]  it'll make your head spin, but its heart from the beginning was pure. That's why the American
[1:03:17.240 --> 1:03:23.080]  system is an enemy of the new world order because it will empower humanity and the American system,
[1:03:23.080 --> 1:03:29.000]  if adopted, will take us to the stars and beyond because, believe me, the stars are just gates.
[1:03:29.560 --> 1:03:36.920]  They're just windows into the universe. We're trapped in purgatory. We're trapped here on this
[1:03:36.920 --> 1:03:44.200]  planet. And we're trapped here. We want to God's fallen creatures as a test. And you know what?
[1:03:44.200 --> 1:03:48.680]  I don't blame God for that. You shouldn't just be given the universe. You shouldn't just be given
[1:03:48.680 --> 1:03:53.640]  eternal life and power and everything God's got for us. If we don't choose the right side,
[1:03:55.080 --> 1:04:00.440]  you know how children are. Does a child appreciate a toy or a coat
[1:04:00.440 --> 1:04:06.680]  or a dinner they didn't cook? How's your child enjoy a dinner they actually cook?
[1:04:07.320 --> 1:04:11.000]  Or a sweater they actually knit? Or a fight they actually win?
[1:04:13.640 --> 1:04:18.520]  Oh, God's a just God. That's why I don't ever blame God for things that happened in my life.
[1:04:18.520 --> 1:04:23.960]  You know some of them are painful because I'm dialed into God. I'm dialed into that spirit
[1:04:23.960 --> 1:04:32.280]  and the enemy can see that and knows that. And all my spirit wants is to never be separated from God.
[1:04:33.720 --> 1:04:37.720]  I'm not looking to screw you over. I'm not looking for a Lamborghini or a private jet
[1:04:37.720 --> 1:04:42.360]  airplane. I don't care about things like that. I care about being right with God and being right
[1:04:42.360 --> 1:04:47.800]  with God means I'm right with you. We'll be back. I'll give the number out. We'll play some other
[1:04:47.800 --> 1:04:53.080]  reports. Get to the election fraud evidence that Trump's totally right. It's actually sick how right
[1:04:53.080 --> 1:04:57.960]  he is and that's why I freak out. I look at Fox News and I'm attacking him saying well he's not lying.
[1:05:23.400 --> 1:05:29.560]  We need each day with our modern diets. Secret 12 by Info Wars Life is an easy way to naturally

[1:05:56.920 --> 1:06:15.240]  We are on the march. The Empire is on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:06:27.240 --> 1:06:38.600]  Let me give out the Sunday phone number. It's different than the weekday number
[1:06:38.600 --> 1:06:44.920]  because we totally produced the Sunday show here in house. The live weekday show is 11 a.m. to
[1:06:45.720 --> 1:06:50.120]  3 p.m. Central. Four hours is probably produced in Minnesota on their satellites
[1:06:50.120 --> 1:06:54.280]  and the GCN Radio Network. Great folks up there. The total free number to join us here
[1:06:54.280 --> 1:07:00.280]  and I specifically ask callers. We don't screen your calls. We let you get on and tell us where
[1:07:00.280 --> 1:07:05.720]  you're listening and your basic topic, but we don't stir and decide what you're going to say.
[1:07:05.720 --> 1:07:10.040]  If you disagree, you go to the other line, which might not be a fair rule, but whatever,
[1:07:10.040 --> 1:07:15.160]  it's an old rule. I still keep it. I would like to hear from you about what do you think of Trump?
[1:07:15.160 --> 1:07:19.560]  I mean, even if you're an enemy of Trump, has he not over-delivered on his promises
[1:07:19.560 --> 1:07:26.840]  in just eight and a half days? We're eight and a half days in. It'll be nine days. I mean,
[1:07:26.840 --> 1:07:31.400]  I'm quite frankly dizzyed by this. That's the word that's been used. It's true. I've been
[1:07:32.440 --> 1:07:37.640]  amazed. I've been shocked. I've been blown away again how my gut just never lies to me.
[1:07:37.640 --> 1:07:42.680]  It just ought to just do whatever it says. The older I get, I follow it and I get more successful.
[1:07:42.680 --> 1:07:51.400]  My gut's the boss now. And my gut says Donald Trump's the boss and that he would do everything
[1:07:51.400 --> 1:07:55.960]  he ever said he would do. And he just kept saying, I will not disappoint you. You can believe it,
[1:07:55.960 --> 1:07:59.720]  guarantee, get ready. The joke is it's like he's a time traveler.
[1:08:04.200 --> 1:08:09.800]  And I'm not going to give the MSM their fodder to attack the president with the conversations
[1:08:09.800 --> 1:08:19.720]  we've had or have had, but a lot of weird stuff in the universe, a lot of crazy stuff going on.
[1:08:20.760 --> 1:08:25.880]  And just as we've been hit by this plague of evil, horrible and anti-human people,
[1:08:25.880 --> 1:08:30.520]  God has given us a reprieve and Trump just keeps delivering on his promises,
[1:08:30.520 --> 1:08:34.520]  which makes him the deliverer. I don't mean that in the blasphemous term like he's Moses,
[1:08:34.520 --> 1:08:42.120]  but he is taking us out of Egypt, the modern system of oppression. So here's the toll-free
[1:08:42.120 --> 1:08:51.800]  number to join us. It's 877-789. Alex, 877-789-2539. And I'd just like to hear your view. Is he not
[1:08:51.800 --> 1:08:56.680]  delivering? Is he delivering? All these people bitching and complaining that he's banned some
[1:08:56.680 --> 1:09:04.840]  Islamic nations like Sudan and Somalia and Syria, which Obama in previous executive order
[1:09:04.840 --> 1:09:13.400]  had the exact same words? That's the big Trump troll. Is he just did what Obama did in 2013?
[1:09:13.400 --> 1:09:20.520]  Why did Obama change that and open it up in 2015? The UN decided to flood us with Islamists
[1:09:20.520 --> 1:09:24.600]  to stage terror attacks because they wouldn't be compatible with our culture, a freedom.
[1:09:24.600 --> 1:09:29.720]  And I've even got top German ministers that are liberals coming out saying,
[1:09:29.720 --> 1:09:34.280]  we get it now. They brought in millions of Muslims into Europe, millions into Germany,
[1:09:34.280 --> 1:09:41.240]  5 million into Europe, 2 million into Germany because it was incompatible to kill our open,
[1:09:41.240 --> 1:09:52.760]  free society. So again, the number to join us is 877-789. Alex and I will punch it up on my
[1:09:52.760 --> 1:10:05.400]  computer. I can log into that bad boy and talk to Jimmy in South Carolina and others.
[1:10:07.160 --> 1:10:10.280]  But before I go any further, let's look at some of the clips today.
[1:10:12.280 --> 1:10:17.320]  Trump, I hope to get along with Russia, knocked the hell out of ISIS together. So he agrees with
[1:10:17.320 --> 1:10:22.520]  Putin to have that ongoing operation, which is good because NATO and other groups do not
[1:10:22.520 --> 1:10:27.560]  want to knock out ISIS. That was their proxy army to take over the Middle East. Talk about a crime
[1:10:27.560 --> 1:10:33.480]  that Trump's reversing and he's making good on it. Here's that clip. We have a great relationship
[1:10:33.480 --> 1:10:39.800]  with Russia and other countries. And if we go after ISIS together, which has to be stopped,
[1:10:39.800 --> 1:10:45.080]  that's an evil that has to be stopped, I will consider that a good thing, not a bad thing.
[1:10:45.080 --> 1:10:50.840]  Absolutely do safe zones in Syria for the people. I think that Europe has made a tremendous mistake
[1:10:50.840 --> 1:10:55.960]  by allowing these millions of people to go into Germany and various other countries. And all you
[1:10:55.960 --> 1:11:01.160]  have to do is take a look. It's a disaster what's happening over there. We will seek friendship
[1:11:01.160 --> 1:11:08.200]  and goodwill with the nations of the world. We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone.
[1:11:08.200 --> 1:11:13.400]  We go out together and knock the hell out of ISIS because that's a real sickness. You know,
[1:11:13.400 --> 1:11:19.080]  the whole ISIS thing is a real sickness. It's a real sickness. Now, speaking of that, let me get
[1:11:19.080 --> 1:11:27.640]  into the stack here because I haven't stacked what Trump's talking about there. And it's so
[1:11:27.640 --> 1:11:32.200]  important here. Let's just, for TV viewers, know what I go through. I'm not bitching when I say
[1:11:32.200 --> 1:11:36.120]  this, but know what it's like to read hundreds of articles and try to actually pick which one
[1:11:36.120 --> 1:11:42.040]  you're going to cover. Voter fraud compilation by Project Veritas, illegals and dead people,
[1:11:42.040 --> 1:11:50.920]  or people voting in their names all over the country. Oh, let's continue. How to deal with
[1:11:50.920 --> 1:11:59.000]  lying liars, the top liar Washington Post says. Yes, Donald Trump lies a lot and news organizations
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:04.360]  should say so. Oh, the Washington Post, again, Trump repeats a lie about popular vote and meeting
[1:12:04.360 --> 1:12:08.280]  with lawmakers, even though it's been proven he was completely right earlier. We broke that down.
[1:12:08.280 --> 1:12:18.280]  The perils of calling Trump a liar. Trump, a lying liar who lies. Oh, did you say lie more?
[1:12:18.280 --> 1:12:22.680]  It's like lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie. No, it's Politico that lies.
[1:12:24.120 --> 1:12:29.480]  So that's just some of the headlines. Sanctuary sheriff faces removal from office for aiding
[1:12:29.480 --> 1:12:35.880]  criminal illegals. Here in Travis County, the sheriff has said she won't even stop people for
[1:12:35.880 --> 1:12:44.760]  DWIs, car wrecks, you name it, they're above the law. And so does the Blasio. The Blasio
[1:12:46.200 --> 1:12:51.880]  has come out and basically said that, well, and here's the big story about the break.
[1:12:53.880 --> 1:12:57.720]  Sure, Obama issued some of the same travel bans on some of the same countries,
[1:12:57.720 --> 1:13:03.400]  but when he did it, it was okay. When Obama does it, it's racist, even though he's banning people
[1:13:03.400 --> 1:13:09.000]  from radical Islamic countries. That's not a race who openly want to kill us and where they have
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:14.840]  civil war zones. Here, unvetted, you're from a civil war zone. You just come on into the United
[1:13:14.840 --> 1:13:19.400]  States and then we'll accept you running people over with cars or shooting people. No, it's a
[1:13:19.400 --> 1:13:25.480]  load of crap. So we've got that. We've got illegal immigrants could elect Hillary. That's the,
[1:13:26.040 --> 1:13:30.280]  that's the Politico admitting that. I've got all these stories, but I've got one here
[1:13:30.280 --> 1:13:37.480]  in my stack. Is it in this stack? I mean, again, you're over hundreds of articles and studies
[1:13:37.480 --> 1:13:42.440]  of election fraud and everything proven. Where do you start here? Maybe it's in this stack. Here,
[1:13:42.440 --> 1:13:48.280]  let me see. Trump sets five year and lifetime lobbying ban on officials, unprecedented toll
[1:13:48.280 --> 1:13:56.840]  delivery. Globalism critics of Trump ban builds for Germany to Google. Got Google, the regular
[1:13:56.840 --> 1:14:01.880]  traders, Germany, open to the Islamists, the women, Channing, Allah Akbar. We want to be
[1:14:02.680 --> 1:14:08.040]  cuckolded by the jihadis. We, you know, we get it. Customs agents ignore judge and force Trump's
[1:14:08.040 --> 1:14:15.320]  travel ban, ACLU. Previous won't apologize for keeping America safe. Trump immigration order
[1:14:15.960 --> 1:14:21.160]  restricted by more US judges and people ignore him because they're illegal. Canada who has incredible
[1:14:21.160 --> 1:14:26.200]  entry restrictions says they'll accept the jihadis. Good Trudeau. When they stab and blow crap up,
[1:14:26.200 --> 1:14:33.320]  you accept it. Trump's visa ban to reportedly keep Oscar nominated director from attending 2017
[1:14:33.320 --> 1:14:38.120]  awards. Well, we can't go to the Islamic countries if we're Christian. That's the whole point. It's
[1:14:38.120 --> 1:14:48.440]  not a society. And it goes on and on, but I'm looking for the clip I've got here where de Blasio
[1:14:49.080 --> 1:14:55.800]  has trouble deferring Trump's immigration policy with Obama's. We're going to play that because
[1:14:55.800 --> 1:15:02.120]  I've got a copy of it in my hundreds of articles of the executive order of Trump versus the executive
[1:15:02.120 --> 1:15:08.040]  order of Obama in 2013, where he bans the same countries for the same reasons and old Trump
[1:15:08.040 --> 1:15:13.240]  did was put his name on it. So when Obama does this, it's okay. But when Trump does it, it's bad.
[1:15:13.800 --> 1:15:18.680]  But alas, we've got to go to break so I can find that article while we go to break and come back
[1:15:18.680 --> 1:15:25.960]  and cover it and take your phone calls. I'm Alan Jones. This is info wars.com, the globalist who
[1:15:25.960 --> 1:15:31.560]  want to make you poor and stupid and controlled hate info wars. What should you do with that

[1:19:01.320 --> 1:19:05.480]  our food that needs to be cleaned. It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[1:19:05.480 --> 1:19:11.560]  The artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.

[1:19:32.760 --> 1:19:39.640]  mitigate or avoid most toxic effects themselves. The general public doesn't. The Alexa pure breeze

[1:20:30.280 --> 1:20:36.920]  this epic battle take place. Go to drudgerport.com and look at that epic image of President Donald
[1:20:36.920 --> 1:20:45.720]  J. Trump 45 as he begins week two strutting through. You can see the fact that his shadow
[1:20:45.720 --> 1:20:52.920]  is not taller than his soul in that powerful photo. Somebody actually out for the people.
[1:20:52.920 --> 1:20:58.200]  Somebody actually out to show all the special interest. They're going to be laid low on machine
[1:20:59.400 --> 1:21:09.160]  dedicated to restoring the Republic. A workhorse who gets off on giant piles of things to do.
[1:21:09.160 --> 1:21:17.080]  Somebody who's OCD for freedom. Let's crank this song up for the 45th president. And there's a
[1:21:17.080 --> 1:21:28.200]  wind on down the road. When our shadows aren't as tall as our souls. And there was a lady we all
[1:21:28.200 --> 1:21:42.680]  know named globalism. Who shines white light and wants to show. Be a rock and rock and roll.
[1:21:45.400 --> 1:21:53.000]  Have you listened very hard? All right, let's get into your phone calls and the news. I found
[1:21:53.000 --> 1:21:57.320]  it. I had the wrong stack here. It's in the Sydney Morning Herald. It was even in some U.S.
[1:21:57.320 --> 1:22:04.280]  newspapers. It's up on m4s.com for the last refuge. Epic. And with Trump, we don't want to
[1:22:04.280 --> 1:22:08.920]  overuse the word epic, but it's all so epic. You have to keep saying epic, epic, epic, epic,
[1:22:08.920 --> 1:22:15.880]  because it's happening. Is Team Trump baiting liberal media and refugee protesters by using
[1:22:15.880 --> 1:22:23.480]  Obama's own policy? Well, go to the Sydney paper. They just say hypocrisy. Herald's son got it too.
[1:22:23.480 --> 1:22:30.280]  Hypocrisy left quiet when Obama also halted visas from the very same countries.
[1:22:31.400 --> 1:22:37.480]  In 2013, President Obama suspended refugees from Iraq for six months. And it goes on.
[1:22:37.480 --> 1:22:42.840]  Congress then passed it. Obama signed off on a law. We're searching visas from states of concern
[1:22:42.840 --> 1:22:51.320]  listing the same states. I mean, Sudan, Somalia, these are war zones. You can't have people just
[1:22:51.320 --> 1:22:57.240]  unvetted getting on airplanes. They're like, Donald Trump's insane. He doesn't want to set off a time
[1:22:57.240 --> 1:23:04.520]  bomb in the middle of your church or your elementary school. Can you believe him? Why,
[1:23:04.520 --> 1:23:12.360]  people just can't unvetted with fake documents show up at JFK. Let's have a big, funded Democratic
[1:23:12.360 --> 1:23:19.160]  de Blasio protest and bitching complain. Can you believe that the Treasury officials,
[1:23:19.160 --> 1:23:23.880]  and can you believe the border officials and you believe the customs officials
[1:23:23.880 --> 1:23:28.920]  are doing what Trump says? This is out of control. I can't believe how far we've fallen
[1:23:28.920 --> 1:23:38.760]  as a society right now. And it goes on and on from there. Again, I'll say it. I am dumbfounded
[1:23:38.760 --> 1:23:45.240]  how good Trump is. There are no special interests saying anything to him. It's all Donald Trump in
[1:23:45.240 --> 1:23:51.880]  there up till two in the morning reading news, reading bills, reading legislation like a madman.
[1:23:54.280 --> 1:24:00.120]  He's like a robot. He's like got political skill, skill and finesse, but he's got like
[1:24:00.120 --> 1:24:05.960]  ass burgers when it comes to like dealing with problems. He wants to just obsess on it and deal
[1:24:05.960 --> 1:24:15.400]  with it. And it's like, it's how God throws curveballs. The globalist panicked and crap themselves
[1:24:15.400 --> 1:24:22.760]  two plus years ago for a real reason. They had actually been assessing Donald Trump for a while,
[1:24:22.760 --> 1:24:26.520]  and they couldn't believe that he was going to try it and it happened.
[1:24:29.160 --> 1:24:31.880]  I want to take your phone calls. We're going to do it here in just a second.
[1:24:31.880 --> 1:24:36.840]  Jim from Jimmy to Tim, to Greg, to Chris, to Mark, to Charles, to Frank, to Dan,
[1:24:36.840 --> 1:24:41.800]  to Andrew, to Jim, to Caroline, to Mark, we're going to take all your phone calls.
[1:24:42.600 --> 1:24:46.680]  But I just ask each caller, don't thank me. Nothing. I don't want thanks. I know you take me.
[1:24:46.680 --> 1:24:52.200]  I thank you. Just give me your point. Give me your view. Bam, bam, bam. I want to take 30,
[1:24:52.200 --> 1:24:55.960]  40 phone calls before this transmission ends in 35 minutes.
[1:24:55.960 --> 1:25:04.600]  But again, magic is in the air. History is happening. This is an incredible time to be alive.
[1:25:05.560 --> 1:25:10.520]  And the panicked, dying mainstream media throws out outrageous lies like nobody was at the
[1:25:10.520 --> 1:25:17.560]  inauguration and, you know, Trump has a small wee wee to try to bait everybody into debating them.
[1:25:17.560 --> 1:25:22.120]  And you still got to expose their liars, but just move on from, oh, this is a diversion.
[1:25:22.120 --> 1:25:25.960]  They're known liars. Here they are. Let's just move forward because
[1:25:28.760 --> 1:25:30.840]  humanity is coming back up for error right now.
[1:25:32.760 --> 1:25:38.680]  Humanity has a vision. Humanity has a destiny. And Donald Trump is dolled into that. And this is
[1:25:38.680 --> 1:25:46.040]  magic. This is magic hour. It's beyond golden hour. Magic hour happens any time you decide to
[1:25:46.040 --> 1:25:51.880]  accept your destiny and decide to tune into believing in humanity and recognizing the enemies
[1:25:51.880 --> 1:25:59.640]  of our species. And I'm Alan Jones. And all I want is for you to be free. And infowars.com
[1:25:59.640 --> 1:26:05.000]  is my little website. And when you take action and you move, nothing on earth can stop you.
[1:26:05.960 --> 1:26:08.840]  Okay, let's, uh, who should we go to first? Who's been holding the longest?
[1:26:09.960 --> 1:26:14.760]  There's so many calls here. We get like 23,000 calls an hour when the system's open.
[1:26:14.760 --> 1:26:19.320]  Other talk shows beg for calls, but oh, Fox News gets hundreds an hour. Oh,
[1:26:19.320 --> 1:26:21.640]  I want to be on Fox News. You're so big.
[1:26:26.200 --> 1:26:30.280]  I don't want to be bigger than Fox News. I just hate what a big fraud it is. Like,
[1:26:30.280 --> 1:26:34.120]  yeah, go to the nursing home to see my grandmother. It's on. And I go to another nursing home. It's
[1:26:34.120 --> 1:26:40.920]  on. It's like, it's like, it's a joke. It controls everything. And sorry, I can't come on your show
[1:26:40.920 --> 1:26:47.400]  under contract to Fox. It's a big cancer. Jimmy in South Carolina, you're on the air.
[1:26:47.400 --> 1:26:56.200]  Yeah, Alex. Number one, I bought you a pro pure water filtration system. I'm thrilled with it.
[1:26:56.200 --> 1:26:59.880]  My kids wouldn't drink anything, but Kool-Aid now they're drinking water.
[1:27:00.840 --> 1:27:03.800]  Well, thank you for the support. They're great gravity-filled systems.
[1:27:03.800 --> 1:27:05.800]  They're 25% off right now. So thank you, sir.
[1:27:06.440 --> 1:27:13.720]  Okay. All right. Now I want to say, Donald, I am so thrilled. Oh my God, he's doing everything he
[1:27:13.720 --> 1:27:19.560]  promised he would do. And he's doing it so quickly. I've got five kids, one on the way.
[1:27:20.360 --> 1:27:25.880]  And I feel so much better about their future. Can you feel the spirit shift?
[1:27:26.600 --> 1:27:32.680]  Oh man, it's like, huh, I feel better getting up in the morning. I feel like there's-
[1:27:32.680 --> 1:27:37.320]  Let me just tell you, Trump personally has told me he feels the spirit of America.
[1:27:37.320 --> 1:27:43.880]  And he just loves it. I'm not trying to. It's just true. Trump is really into serving the people.
[1:27:43.880 --> 1:27:48.600]  And I think the enemy feels that. Well, we sure appreciate everything you do.
[1:27:48.600 --> 1:27:51.320]  I know you don't like to be thanked, but we love you, brother. Take care.
[1:27:51.320 --> 1:27:53.640]  No, no, no, don't hang up. Jimmy, you still there?
[1:27:53.640 --> 1:27:54.440]  Yes, sir.
[1:27:54.440 --> 1:27:56.680]  What does your gut tell you, though? I think they're going to try to kill him.
[1:27:57.320 --> 1:27:59.880]  I think they're telling us already what they're going to do.
[1:28:00.440 --> 1:28:03.960]  We know they can, we know they can play with the stock market.
[1:28:03.960 --> 1:28:09.880]  So I think they're going to do whatever they can do to dump the market and blame it on Trump.
[1:28:11.160 --> 1:28:17.320]  That's just my opinion. But dad or kill him, and I pray to God, I plead the blood of Jesus over
[1:28:17.320 --> 1:28:24.520]  Donald Trump. And I speak anything down against him that anybody would try to kill him or something.
[1:28:24.520 --> 1:28:29.560]  But I really feel like the only thing they could do besides go after him physically
[1:28:29.560 --> 1:28:34.440]  with the stock market. I agree. Oh, I've got a stack of news.
[1:28:34.440 --> 1:28:39.160]  They're saying the depressions here, you know, it's all over. It's Trump's fault.
[1:28:39.880 --> 1:28:45.880]  It makes me cry because forget trusting Trump. His actions prove everything. Judges,
[1:28:45.880 --> 1:28:50.680]  treebots, fruits, they are going to come after him. He knows it too. He's ready.
[1:28:50.680 --> 1:28:54.600]  He's very fatalistic, I'll tell you that. He's ready. I'll be back. Stay with us.
[1:28:54.600 --> 1:29:02.920]  Who is Ike Batista? Once the richest man in Brazil, a successful oil and mining tycoon,
[1:29:02.920 --> 1:29:07.080]  and now a fugitive to justice. Brazil is currently trying to drain its own swamp,
[1:29:07.080 --> 1:29:11.400]  and the arrest of Batista is one of many steps they are taking. It turns out Batista,
[1:29:11.400 --> 1:29:16.040]  owner of the EBX Group, was involved in bribes to the government via interactions with former
[1:29:16.040 --> 1:29:21.320]  governor of Rio de Janeiro, Sergio Cabral, who was also arrested in conjunctions with
[1:29:21.320 --> 1:29:26.200]  activities involving the state-owned oil company Petrovas. Brazil's own drain, the swamp, has
[1:29:26.200 --> 1:29:31.800]  been called Yava Jato, or Car Wash. It has produced many arrests, including Cabral's top aide and
[1:29:31.800 --> 1:29:38.040]  former secretary in Rio, Wilson Carlos Carvalho, former governor of Rio Anthony Garatinho, under
[1:29:38.040 --> 1:29:43.880]  suspicion of vote rigging, a former top executive with Batista Flavio Godinho, accused of money
[1:29:43.880 --> 1:29:48.520]  laundering and association with Cabral, and another top aide of Cabral's, Carlos Miranda,
[1:29:48.520 --> 1:29:52.840]  has also been jailed, showing the United States that it is possible to drain the swamp,
[1:29:52.840 --> 1:29:57.160]  and nobody is above the law. This is Owen Schreuer for infowars.com.
[1:29:58.920 --> 1:30:04.920]  We have the new product at infowarsalife.com, BioTrue Selenium. We've had so many requests
[1:30:04.920 --> 1:30:10.920]  over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic,
[1:30:10.920 --> 1:30:16.280]  bioavailable selenium from Mustard Seed Extract. When you take selenium in the body,
[1:30:16.280 --> 1:30:22.120]  it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body. It helps balance the thyroid gland,
[1:30:22.120 --> 1:30:28.040]  it helps detoxify. Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves. The highest concentration
[1:30:28.040 --> 1:30:31.880]  of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body. As a matter
[1:30:31.880 --> 1:30:38.680]  of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium, so it really
[1:30:38.680 --> 1:30:45.160]  is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs. I'm taking it now, every day. This is
[1:30:45.160 --> 1:30:50.680]  Soki. BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring. We believe it's the
[1:30:50.680 --> 1:30:54.680]  best out there at a very, very low price. Exclusively available at infowarsalife.com,

[1:32:04.200 --> 1:32:09.080]  new off-the-grid products of 2017. And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[1:32:09.080 --> 1:32:13.320]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from Science,
[1:32:13.320 --> 1:32:17.400]  one of our oldest sponsors. The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket,
[1:32:17.400 --> 1:32:22.520]  but so powerful you can run some 110 appliances at your house, like a small refrigerator so you
[1:32:22.520 --> 1:32:27.400]  can keep food from spoiling. Plus, you can take it with you to jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18
[1:32:27.400 --> 1:32:31.640]  wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes. The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid
[1:32:31.640 --> 1:32:36.600]  electricity, allowing you to create your own private power grid, literally anywhere in the world.

[1:33:23.080 --> 1:33:31.320]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. Okay, I've got like 30 phone calls I want to go to.
[1:33:33.640 --> 1:33:37.800]  Please don't forget we are running a special doing the sports broadcast that get great systems for
[1:33:37.800 --> 1:33:41.880]  you and your family with all the life of states and toxins in the water supply, whether it's tap
[1:33:41.880 --> 1:33:47.400]  water or well. I think you're nuts if you're not using the gravity fields system by Alexa Pure,

[1:34:02.360 --> 1:34:07.480]  so much, but the fact that you use these systems really is a major game changer. You won't feel
[1:34:07.480 --> 1:34:14.120]  it today, but 30 years later you certainly will when you're not dying of cancer. I want to go to
[1:34:14.120 --> 1:34:19.880]  Tim and Greg and Chris and Mark and Charles and Frank and Dan and Andrew and Jim and Caroline and
[1:34:19.880 --> 1:34:27.000]  Mark. I gotta tell you, that last caller was powerful. Where should we talk to first? There's
[1:34:27.000 --> 1:34:34.440]  so many people here to talk to. Let's talk to Caroline or Caroline in Utah. Let's talk to her.
[1:34:34.440 --> 1:34:40.280]  You're on the air from Utah. Go ahead. Hi, Alex. It's awesome to talk to you. Thank you so much for
[1:34:40.280 --> 1:34:46.920]  all you do. We're all in this together. We are. We are. And praise God. I want you to know something.
[1:34:48.040 --> 1:34:56.040]  I'm over here and I've got tears running down my face because I'm so grateful for feeling so much
[1:34:56.040 --> 1:35:04.760]  more free. That's how I feel with President Trump. I haven't felt this free in a long time.
[1:35:06.040 --> 1:35:09.400]  Well, it's definitely real. The enemy's scared worldwide. They got all these foreign governments
[1:35:09.400 --> 1:35:15.160]  against me. He's really doing what he said he would do. And he's committed. He is, like CNN said,
[1:35:15.160 --> 1:35:20.440]  he's, quote, obsessed with doing what he said he'd do, as if that's a bad thing. It isn't a bad
[1:35:20.440 --> 1:35:25.080]  thing. It's an awesome thing. And one of the great things I love about him is it's like iron
[1:35:25.080 --> 1:35:31.160]  sharpening iron. He's stepping up to the plate. He's keeping his word. I watch his rallies every
[1:35:31.160 --> 1:35:37.320]  single day and you too, by the way. And, you know, he's doing what he said is do. He's keeping his
[1:35:37.320 --> 1:35:41.800]  promises and all the guys and all the men. I mean, they've got to step up to the plate.
[1:35:41.800 --> 1:35:45.640]  Yeah. Trump's an example of how a man should act. I'm going to jump to get some more callers,
[1:35:45.640 --> 1:35:50.680]  but thank you. I love you. I appreciate all of you. Trump's what a real man acts like. And let
[1:35:50.680 --> 1:35:55.160]  me tell you something. In talk radio and TV, I'm known as the hardest working person there is.
[1:35:55.720 --> 1:35:59.160]  Drudge is well known to work 18 hours a day as well. I'm not kissing Drudge's butt. It's true.
[1:35:59.960 --> 1:36:05.240]  It does a better job than I can with the websites. But with Trump, it's even, it's even crazier.
[1:36:05.240 --> 1:36:12.280]  I mean, I know the behind the scenes stuff. He is a maniac. He does 200 calls a day just on the
[1:36:12.280 --> 1:36:19.800]  economy, a hundred to media, maybe a hundred other to politicians. We're talking 400, 500 calls a day.
[1:36:22.280 --> 1:36:30.280]  And he understands it's all about will. And he's literally in the zeitgeist on fire.
[1:36:30.280 --> 1:36:36.040]  Donald Trump is on fire. I'm not, it's not a cult of Donald Trump. It's just he's done it.
[1:36:36.040 --> 1:36:40.440]  He's delivered. He's doing it. It's an example. It's the return of the men.
[1:36:41.560 --> 1:36:47.000]  And I'll sit here and tell you that at 43 years old, I can't work like this. He's 70,
[1:36:47.000 --> 1:36:52.920]  the oldest president ever inaugurated. This just got magic written all over it.
[1:36:53.800 --> 1:36:55.800]  Greg in New Jersey, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[1:36:55.800 --> 1:37:00.760]  All right, Alex, here's the thing that kills me about this news media.
[1:37:01.320 --> 1:37:05.880]  You know, you got lies of omission and you got lies of commission. And here's the lie of omission.
[1:37:06.440 --> 1:37:11.640]  But all these reports that they're talking about the, about Trump putting the quote ban,
[1:37:11.640 --> 1:37:18.600]  if you will, no one, and I mean no one bothers to read the law and the law according to US code
[1:37:18.600 --> 1:37:27.080]  Title 8, Chapter 12, Sub Chapter 2, Section 1182. Here it is in paragraph F, suspension of entry
[1:37:27.080 --> 1:37:33.160]  or imposition of restriction by president. And it says plain as day, whenever the president
[1:37:33.160 --> 1:37:38.680]  finds that the entry of any aliens or any class of aliens into the United States
[1:37:38.680 --> 1:37:45.640]  would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. He may by proclamation and for
[1:37:45.640 --> 1:37:52.840]  such period as he shall deem necessary suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens
[1:37:52.840 --> 1:37:57.480]  as immigrants or non-immigrants or impose. That's right. All I was saying earlier,
[1:37:57.480 --> 1:38:03.400]  he's invoking an old law that Obama has used on the same countries. It's just an example of how
[1:38:03.400 --> 1:38:09.240]  they think we're not watching. They just pity party everything. Oh, people can't come from Somalia
[1:38:09.240 --> 1:38:13.560]  where there's like no airports and rocket launchers and women are like in slave pits.
[1:38:13.560 --> 1:38:16.760]  Women live in Somalia in slave pits.
[1:38:18.040 --> 1:38:22.600]  Well, this is, and this is what I don't understand. Here's this federal judge, this Ann Donnelly.
[1:38:22.600 --> 1:38:27.160]  How is it I'm able to find this, this law in 30 seconds going up to
[1:38:27.160 --> 1:38:32.200]  Ann Donnelly is a political person. That's why the, that's why customs is ignoring her,
[1:38:32.200 --> 1:38:38.360]  which is good. Trump is forcing the fact. He knows all he's doing is a set law. He knows it's not
[1:38:38.360 --> 1:38:43.240]  even his law. He knows they're going to flip out and freak out and burn stuff down and attack
[1:38:43.240 --> 1:38:47.480]  everybody and then have riots and then he'll just go, oh, it was what Obama did. That's why he's so
[1:38:47.480 --> 1:38:52.920]  smart. Well, and that's it. He's like a big cat and he's playing with, with his prey before he eats
[1:38:52.920 --> 1:38:59.240]  them. And it's ridiculous that these people are so stupid that they think astrology, but he is a
[1:38:59.240 --> 1:39:04.680]  Leo. He is a big cat. They are so arrogant. They think that we're so stupid that we don't, that
[1:39:04.680 --> 1:39:07.480]  we don't read the law. You don't have to be a lawyer to read the law. That's why it's written
[1:39:07.480 --> 1:39:11.400]  in English. And that's why I'm so glad that, you know, you get on the news and on your show
[1:39:11.400 --> 1:39:16.360]  and tell people, hey, go look it up for yourself. That's all we do. And they just go, oh, it's fake
[1:39:16.360 --> 1:39:21.640]  news. I'm like, like 15 studies that three million illegals voted just like Trump said. They just
[1:39:21.640 --> 1:39:28.040]  keep going, he's a liar. He's a, he's a liar. I'm seeing in. Trump is a liar. I appreciate you.
[1:39:28.040 --> 1:39:33.880]  God bless you. Let's jam in some more calls here. Let's talk to Mark in North Carolina. He says,
[1:39:33.880 --> 1:39:39.400]  the enemy is uniting. I agree. We think we're winning folks. We better redouble our efforts.
[1:39:39.400 --> 1:39:45.720]  The real fight's about to start. Go ahead. Yeah, Alex, I have this theory. I've had it for a while
[1:39:45.720 --> 1:39:50.840]  too. Kind of goes along with a lot of years, but I think it goes a step further even. There's three
[1:39:52.760 --> 1:39:57.480]  entities that are trying to take, that are trying to unite the world into a new world order.
[1:39:58.120 --> 1:40:02.760]  The new world order itself, which is basically corporate bank, you know,
[1:40:02.760 --> 1:40:09.800]  that's the Anglo-American stuff. Yeah. The other part is the Islamists, mostly Wahhabis. No,
[1:40:09.800 --> 1:40:14.920]  I don't consider the Shiites to be in that. No, they're not. They're not. Yeah. And the others
[1:40:14.920 --> 1:40:19.640]  are the communists who have always wanted basically one word. I agree. It's communists,
[1:40:20.280 --> 1:40:27.000]  it's Wahhabist, and it's the mega bankers. But I think what they plan on, each thinks,
[1:40:27.000 --> 1:40:32.280]  at some point, they'll be able to overcome the others. The big people with the big money,
[1:40:32.280 --> 1:40:35.160]  the new world order. But don't you think Trump's about to roll them all up?
[1:40:36.680 --> 1:40:43.800]  Yeah. I mean, the alliance with Russia and Japan and England's going to be hard to beat.
[1:40:45.240 --> 1:40:50.760]  My thing is Trump, Putin, making the world great again. I put it all over my Facebook.
[1:40:51.400 --> 1:40:57.960]  I really think Putin is also, if anything but the guy, the globalist for making them out to be the
[1:40:57.960 --> 1:41:02.680] ... I was driving to work today, and I just thought of like Trump king of the world, but like turning
[1:41:02.680 --> 1:41:07.400]  the world loose, not a king that dominates, but a king that turns people loose. I agree. So where do
[1:41:07.400 --> 1:41:15.160]  you see this going? I see it's going to come to a real tough battle. But I think if we patriots
[1:41:16.920 --> 1:41:22.840]  stick to it, and I think we got to unite with our brothers in places like Russia and the British,
[1:41:22.840 --> 1:41:28.120]  like the UKIP type of people in Britain, that we can destroy this new world order once and for all.
[1:41:28.120 --> 1:41:32.360]  Yeah, there's no doubt. The new world order is anti-prosperity, anti-human. It's dirtbag.
[1:41:32.360 --> 1:41:37.160]  It's anti-prosperity. We just put that out. They lose. I mean, it's kind of like six years ago,
[1:41:37.160 --> 1:41:42.520]  they had the whole world government tree, and then the treaty got leaked where the third world
[1:41:42.520 --> 1:41:47.720]  had basically doubled the taxes of the West. The third world says the screw job. Globalism
[1:41:47.720 --> 1:41:53.000]  isn't good for anybody. And so we all need to come together against the new world order. I appreciate
[1:41:53.000 --> 1:41:57.640]  your call. Great points, my friend. I'm going to go to break and I'm going to come back. Thank you,
[1:41:57.640 --> 1:42:01.880]  Mark. I'm going to take like 10 calls in 10 minutes. We're going to do it. So have your points
[1:42:01.880 --> 1:42:05.960]  ready. I love you. I appreciate you. Have them ready. We're going to come back to those briefly.

[1:42:17.720 --> 1:42:22.840]  don't. We bring in a fraction of that. You know, people like, oh my gosh, you're $50 million a year
[1:42:22.840 --> 1:42:28.920]  to run your operation. People have no idea. We reach 50 million people a week. So that's nothing.

[1:45:26.440 --> 1:45:29.880]  people that currently are testing for us, they didn't just say outstanding, what they really

[1:46:57.720 --> 1:47:16.600]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:16.600 --> 1:47:21.400]  Now I won't get to a lot of the clips I have, but that's okay. We'll be back tomorrow at 11 a.m.
[1:47:21.400 --> 1:47:25.880]  3 p.m. Central with a big four-hour long transmission. Right now, I want to focus on taking a lot of
[1:47:25.880 --> 1:47:32.840]  your phone calls. We're going to talk to Charles, then we're going to talk to Frank and Dan
[1:47:32.840 --> 1:47:37.560]  and Andrew and Jim and Mark and Tim. But right now, Charles in New York, you're on the air.
[1:47:39.320 --> 1:47:48.680]  Thank you very much. Alex, I know that President Trump is well versed in history, and he returned
[1:47:48.680 --> 1:47:56.600]  the Andrew Jackson picture to the White House. Just to let you know that on January 30th,
[1:47:57.480 --> 1:48:04.040]  January 30th, which will be tomorrow, but in 1835, there was an attempt on President Jackson's life.
[1:48:05.400 --> 1:48:14.280]  A fellow attacked him with two pistols and fired one. It misfired, and then he tried the second one.
[1:48:14.280 --> 1:48:20.360]  It misfired. Later, they investigated the guns were actually working, and they said that it could
[1:48:20.360 --> 1:48:28.440]  be because it was a humid day. It was Providence. Yes, exactly. Jackson already stabbed more than
[1:48:28.440 --> 1:48:34.360]  10 times and shot many times, survived more than six duals, seven duals before that. He was a real
[1:48:34.360 --> 1:48:41.720]  deal. And you know, a little bit of Americana for all Americans to consider. The prosecuting attorney
[1:48:41.720 --> 1:48:48.840]  for Francis was Francis Scott Key, who was the author of the Star Spangled Banner.
[1:48:49.400 --> 1:48:54.920]  So it is meaningful. We're living a very special time. And I think the best line that I've heard
[1:48:54.920 --> 1:49:02.520]  in your program ever was the answer to 1984 is 1776. And I believe that that is a thesis for the
[1:49:02.520 --> 1:49:07.800]  New World. I agree. What do you think of Trump? I mean, I don't want to be over positive, but how
[1:49:07.800 --> 1:49:14.040]  could you be negative? It's just total delivery. Well, he has to do it quickly. And his biggest
[1:49:14.040 --> 1:49:18.600]  enemy will turn out to be, as someone else mentioned earlier, manipulation of the stock
[1:49:18.600 --> 1:49:25.560]  market and the financial system. The central bank was actually, you know, what President Jackson
[1:49:26.280 --> 1:49:30.040]  said. He said, I killed the bank on his death. No, I agree. But they should understand the
[1:49:30.040 --> 1:49:35.080]  force they're up against. If they really think that with their bravada or hutzpah, that they're
[1:49:35.080 --> 1:49:43.240]  going to beat the spirit, they should roll over. You know, the Achilles Sancle to all this is the
[1:49:43.240 --> 1:49:51.240]  fact that a loan that is made from thin air by producing the money out of the ether is worthless.
[1:49:51.240 --> 1:49:57.400]  And you're charging interest on it, which is it can be nationalized anytime. Correct. And so any
[1:49:57.400 --> 1:50:03.400]  loan over a million dollars that can be accounted for by anyone, be it dirty money or whatever,
[1:50:03.400 --> 1:50:09.000]  or it's null and void. It's null and void. So therefore there's the key, I think, to any of
[1:50:09.000 --> 1:50:14.920]  these attacks on the president from no, I mean, I personally have encouraged everybody involved
[1:50:14.920 --> 1:50:20.360]  with Trump, including the president, that we're not people that just take the gloves off for no
[1:50:20.360 --> 1:50:26.360]  reason. We're not looking for quick fixes, but the enemy's so cancerous, take the gloves off.
[1:50:26.360 --> 1:50:31.320]  We're ready to just deal with this right now. And they're never going to give in. They're
[1:50:31.320 --> 1:50:36.840]  never going to stop. They are out to get us. They're their enemies. And so why should we play
[1:50:36.840 --> 1:50:42.840]  patty cake with these people? It's time to crush them. It's time to crush them.
[1:50:42.840 --> 1:50:49.400]  And put everybody in debt, then this is not a good world order. It's 1984.
[1:50:49.400 --> 1:50:53.640]  No, I agree. I agree. It's an antiprosperous world they're building. Thank you, Charles. Beautiful
[1:50:53.640 --> 1:51:00.440]  points. No, it's time to, they want to bang heads. Let's just ram heads. But it doesn't mean we like
[1:51:00.440 --> 1:51:04.760]  play games on Ram. They're heading to us. We don't go back. No, you want to ram heads that this
[1:51:04.760 --> 1:51:10.120]  is going to happen. Frank in New York, you're on the air. Go ahead. Hey, Alex. Long time no
[1:51:10.120 --> 1:51:15.400]  here. How are you? Good, brother. Go ahead. I'm very good. Thank you. I just want to just tell
[1:51:15.400 --> 1:51:20.680]  your audience that in my lifetime, I've never seen a president that's delivering like this guy's
[1:51:20.680 --> 1:51:26.280]  delivery. He's already dwarfing Reagan. Let's just be honest. Nothing is wrong with Reagan.
[1:51:26.280 --> 1:51:33.240]  He's already dwarfing Reagan. This is ridiculously real. I agree. And I believe that this is our
[1:51:33.240 --> 1:51:38.840]  providence like in the Bible, like when God gave his people a hundred year reprieve. I think this
[1:51:38.840 --> 1:51:45.080]  is our reprieve. I truly believe that. Or a hundred year reprieve for none of them. Yes, correct.
[1:51:45.640 --> 1:51:50.440]  Yes. And then the other previous poll are mentioned about the Muslims. That's actually
[1:51:50.440 --> 1:51:55.800]  public law 414, which the president has every right to bar anyone who comes to this country
[1:51:55.800 --> 1:51:59.880]  if they're a threat to the United States. No kidding. Don't bring people in that are
[1:51:59.880 --> 1:52:08.440]  murdering each other in giant bloody war zones. Duh. I agree. I have one more comment by my place.
[1:52:09.480 --> 1:52:12.840]  I have a couple of problems with this administration. I have to be honest with you.
[1:52:12.840 --> 1:52:18.280]  There's two things that I'm a little bothered with is the treasurer secretary saying that he's
[1:52:18.280 --> 1:52:23.400]  going to have to expand the IRS. For me, that's a big problem. I agree. A big time problem.
[1:52:23.400 --> 1:52:27.800]  A big time problem. And the other one is that when he appointed on the things that
[1:52:27.800 --> 1:52:31.320]  public education had, what's her name? That billionaire from Michigan? Yes, she's
[1:52:31.320 --> 1:52:37.320]  princess sister. Yes, exactly. I have a big problem with that because I agree with what's his name
[1:52:37.320 --> 1:52:42.760]  with. Well, sure. Let's see. I got a jump. We'll see what they do. We're going to watch it. I
[1:52:42.760 --> 1:52:47.720]  agree with what you're saying. And like torture is one of his bad points, too. Trump's not perfect,
[1:52:47.720 --> 1:52:51.560]  but he certainly is delivering what he said he do. It's night and day with Obama.
[1:52:51.560 --> 1:52:54.120]  Thank you, Frank. Dan in Indiana, you're on the air.
[1:52:56.040 --> 1:53:03.720]  Hello. Go ahead, brother. Yeah. Okay. I want to say thank you for the prize that I got for the
[1:53:03.720 --> 1:53:10.760]  Bill Clinton t-shirt contest. I finally got it. Oh, good. So you went out and said Bill Clinton's
[1:53:10.760 --> 1:53:18.280]  the ripest. You got your prize. Yeah. When he was in Cleveland, I disrupted it and I yelled in
[1:53:18.280 --> 1:53:26.280]  a horror rape. And he had to stop the speech. The thing I want to talk about is there is a lot of
[1:53:26.280 --> 1:53:33.000]  religion being thrown around at Trump's inaugural speech when he had
[1:53:33.000 --> 1:53:36.520]  Sir, well, I mean, he's just invoking God. Your phone's really breaking up back. Go ahead,
[1:53:36.520 --> 1:53:44.120]  make your point. He was he had the Mormons. He had Paula White. He had Wayne T. Jackson.
[1:53:44.120 --> 1:53:53.000]  Listen, this guy, Wayne T. Jackson did a ritual where he crawled up on a man's butt.
[1:53:53.560 --> 1:53:58.360]  Well, listen, I don't know anything about that. A butt pirates or whatever. All I know is Trump's
[1:53:58.360 --> 1:54:03.000]  invoking God, something Obama wouldn't do. Calling him on Jesus, calling on God for power,
[1:54:03.000 --> 1:54:07.160]  but I hear you. I got to jump. Your, your phone sounds like, at least my ears sound like a robot.
[1:54:07.960 --> 1:54:11.880]  It's a bit bad. Okay. So your phones are so badly. Is this actually happening?
[1:54:11.880 --> 1:54:15.240]  I'm not cutting you off, Dan. Call it back tomorrow. I'd love to hear from you.
[1:54:16.200 --> 1:54:17.880]  Andrew, a pencil van. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[1:54:19.080 --> 1:54:24.440]  I love a lot of what Trump is doing, too, but one has to understand that the president,
[1:54:24.440 --> 1:54:29.400]  just like Congress, is limited by the power. If it's not commerce clause related.
[1:54:29.400 --> 1:54:32.040]  Sure. Back off your phone. Back off your phone. It's overdriven. Go ahead.
[1:54:32.680 --> 1:54:37.560]  Yeah. And one was saying if it's not related to the several states,
[1:54:37.560 --> 1:54:42.360]  uh, commerce clause related, the president, Congress has to stay out. And also someone
[1:54:42.360 --> 1:54:47.080]  that started by Trump is involved with Israel because people he's hired are the dreading,
[1:54:47.080 --> 1:54:51.160]  the word, which I'm not going to say because, uh, you know, generally when I touch them,
[1:54:51.160 --> 1:54:53.880]  they can all that. Any, uh, and anything about that?
[1:54:55.240 --> 1:55:00.280]  Yeah, I'm making, uh, they tell me that maybe my phone system, they tell me they can understand
[1:55:00.280 --> 1:55:01.800]  you. I can't understand you. Say it again.
[1:55:01.800 --> 1:55:09.080]  Yeah. Donald Trump occasionally has hired, uh, people that are the dreaded, the word,
[1:55:09.080 --> 1:55:12.360]  which suggests that he works for Israel. I'm not going to say cause.
[1:55:12.360 --> 1:55:17.720]  Oh, okay. I appreciate your call. Look, there's this mental illness. Israel's this tiny country
[1:55:17.720 --> 1:55:22.280]  with like a few million people and everybody thinks it runs everything. So I just don't get
[1:55:22.280 --> 1:55:26.600]  involved in it. I mean, I just want to like have lower taxes and have freedom of religion and
[1:55:26.600 --> 1:55:31.960]  private property in this country. Everybody like calls up and says, Jew was like a magic word or
[1:55:31.960 --> 1:55:37.880]  something when Israel's an incredibly diverse country. Uh, so yeah, I mean, he's like his,
[1:55:37.880 --> 1:55:43.800]  his daughter married a Jewish guy. Great. It's a good looking guy. Good looking kids. Um,
[1:55:45.480 --> 1:55:50.200]  I don't know what else to say. I mean, I just don't like, Oh God, you know, let's kill the
[1:55:50.200 --> 1:55:55.240]  Jews. There's somebody called in about them. I, I just don't get it. I'm about ideology. I'm about
[1:55:55.240 --> 1:56:01.720]  ideas. See, not, not where you came from, what color you are. So I don't care if you're a Mexican
[1:56:01.720 --> 1:56:06.760]  or you're Russian or you're Japanese, you're Algerian, you want freedom and second amendment
[1:56:06.760 --> 1:56:11.160]  private property? Man, come on in. You don't like that. Get the hell out of my life. Okay.
[1:56:12.440 --> 1:56:16.280]  Uh, let's go ahead and talk to, uh, Jim in Texas, Jim, you're on the air.
[1:56:17.560 --> 1:56:23.160]  Hey Alex, I think one of the best ways Obama could get, or excuse me, Trump could get a
[1:56:23.160 --> 1:56:28.440]  tidal wave on his side, calling for repeal of Obamacare. Forget replacement. Well, I mean,
[1:56:28.440 --> 1:56:33.480]  he is, he is calling for basically a repeal. It's a replacement though. Right. But if he would,
[1:56:33.480 --> 1:56:38.680]  uh, reverse all of the waivers that were granted by President Obama to, for example,
[1:56:38.680 --> 1:56:44.600]  the entire states of Nevada and New Hampshire or McDonald's, but that's a great point. Yes.
[1:56:45.880 --> 1:56:48.520]  Get rid of the waivers and all those corporations won't want it.
[1:56:48.520 --> 1:56:54.680]  Yes, exactly. You got it. Thank you, Alex. Perfect. Thank you, brother. Uh, Mark in Arizona,
[1:56:54.680 --> 1:56:59.960]  you're on the air. Go ahead. Hey, thanks for taking my call, Alex. Two things real quick.
[1:56:59.960 --> 1:57:03.800]  I'm from the land of Sheriff Joe. So we already kind of know how it's going to go for the next
[1:57:03.800 --> 1:57:10.200]  four years at least. Um, I just love how Trump is, is, is playing this media and turning a one-day
[1:57:10.200 --> 1:57:15.960]  news cycle, which I thought was crazy into a one hour news cycle. And you're right. He works so hard.
[1:57:15.960 --> 1:57:20.280]  No one can keep up. And that's what they're frustrated about. I agree. I've told my crew.
[1:57:20.280 --> 1:57:22.760]  I said, I don't know what you're going to do. I'm in the seven days a week now.
[1:57:23.400 --> 1:57:27.480]  I'm going to work more tonight. I mean, it's just, I can feel the energy. I always thought I had the
[1:57:27.480 --> 1:57:32.440]  energy. It's so good to hit somebody that's got even more than me. It's like, feels great.
[1:57:32.440 --> 1:57:36.360]  I'm sorry to Tim and Chris and everybody else. I'm out of time. Great job. The crew,
[1:57:36.360 --> 1:57:39.800]  please join me tomorrow. I love you all. I thank you all. I'm humble before you all
[1:57:39.800 --> 1:57:46.760]  tomorrow. 11amcentralm4s.com. Spread that link. They hate it.
