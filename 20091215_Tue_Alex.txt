[07:04.600 --> 07:09.360]  generator now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the
[07:09.360 --> 07:13.280]  solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the
[07:13.280 --> 07:17.120]  lungs the respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne
[07:17.120 --> 07:22.080]  pathogens and viruses the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system
[07:22.080 --> 07:27.360]  with your self-produced nano silver solutions and also delivers the silver
[07:27.360 --> 07:32.000]  nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream with continued legislation
[07:32.000 --> 07:36.200]  threatening the sale of nano silver products you can now produce pure and
[07:36.200 --> 07:41.120]  endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator very easy to follow
[07:41.120 --> 07:45.560]  step-by-step instructions are provided making production fast and simple go

[08:00.000 --> 08:05.800]  the Genesis communications radio network proudly presents the Alex Jones show
[08:05.800 --> 08:10.520]  because there's a war on for your mind
[08:10.520 --> 08:17.800]  we're going to go live we're live on the radio right now on this Tuesday the
[08:17.800 --> 08:23.000]  15th of December 2009 edition we're going to simulcast at prisonplanet.tv in
[08:23.000 --> 08:27.800]  the second third and fourth hour today and when I start the second hour I'm
[08:27.800 --> 08:33.840]  going to play several video clips of what members of the United Nations IPCC do
[08:33.840 --> 08:39.960]  at press conferences when accredited press asked them simple questions about
[08:39.960 --> 08:45.840]  climate gay now one of the same reporters who was grabbed and drug out for
[08:45.840 --> 08:50.800]  politely asking a question of one of the heads of the IPCC Friday he has now
[08:50.800 --> 08:58.320]  gotten up to Al Gore and politely asked him about previous things Gore has said
[08:58.320 --> 09:05.160]  that have turned out to be false and Al Gore's goons just assaulting so these
[09:05.160 --> 09:11.400]  people are tyrants and that is coming up later in the next hour we will play
[09:11.400 --> 09:17.200]  those video clips for everyone and go over the true nature of these
[09:17.200 --> 09:21.880]  individuals and I want to go back to the weekend and an article written for
[09:21.880 --> 09:27.640]  prisonplanet.com furious reaction to sick editorial calling for global one
[09:27.640 --> 09:33.360]  child policy dictatorship this lady had agreed to do an interview that that wrote
[09:33.360 --> 09:42.880]  the editorial for Canada's financial post and then actually backed out of the
[09:42.880 --> 09:49.480]  interview but I want to go over that because we can't just let this die the
[09:49.480 --> 10:01.960]  issue of China actually proposing at the Copenhagen event the global government
[10:01.960 --> 10:06.520]  event a global one child policy simultaneously with all these newspapers
[10:06.520 --> 10:13.400]  calling for the exact same thing so that is going to be coming up later in the
[10:13.400 --> 10:16.720]  second hour let me just read over some of the headlines I have here that I'm
[10:16.720 --> 10:25.920]  gonna go to your calls throughout the four hour broadcast today internet
[10:25.920 --> 10:30.840]  filter gets green light the government is pushing ahead with this controversial
[10:30.840 --> 10:35.320]  plan to filter the internet with quote Chinese style censorship that's in
[10:35.320 --> 10:43.480]  Australia Democrats plan nearly two trillion debt limit hike Ron Paul warns
[10:43.480 --> 10:48.840]  that nightmare big government health care bill will pass Obama's safe schools
[10:48.840 --> 10:56.040]  ours tied to lewd readings for seventh graders it's that's putting it lightly
[10:56.040 --> 11:02.320]  the real reason behind the Copenhagen walkout supreme court ruling means
[11:02.320 --> 11:11.080]  torture could return if climate gate is no big deal why are questions about it
[11:11.080 --> 11:14.920]  met with an armed response again I mentioned that at dovetails with the
[11:14.920 --> 11:20.360]  latest assault on this gentleman for daring to ask questions of any of the
[11:20.360 --> 11:33.080]  globalist on the subject of climate gate African states in climate talks boycott
[11:33.080 --> 11:37.840]  that was yesterday that for a few hours they staged a little walkouts saying
[11:37.840 --> 11:44.680]  look this massively cuts our industrial base on the media spinning it that no
[11:44.680 --> 11:48.160]  they want more money no that's not what it is they've actually read what we've
[11:48.160 --> 11:52.400]  been talking about for a week and a half the actual treaty that hasn't even been
[11:52.400 --> 11:57.080]  brought publicly forward yet but is available stating that the cuts are
[11:57.080 --> 12:03.000]  meant to destroy their industrial base deadlock threatens Copenhagen climate
[12:03.000 --> 12:08.200]  deal that's today so the deadlock Israel the walkout is continuing China India
[12:08.200 --> 12:14.680]  walkout on climate talks climate treaty would create new global agencies to
[12:14.680 --> 12:18.640]  transfer money the technology from us another developed countries of third
[12:18.640 --> 12:22.760]  world that's not really true it transfers them to the IMF and World Bank in
[12:22.760 --> 12:35.880]  their colonization operation also Gore has said that ice may vanish in five to
[12:35.880 --> 12:42.000]  seven years yes and a giant asteroid from gobbledygook might strike the
[12:42.000 --> 12:49.440]  planet and blood-drinking vampiric toads might crawl out of it and begin
[12:49.440 --> 12:54.400]  feeding us into blenders and making smoothies out of us it I mean that could
[12:54.400 --> 13:01.960]  happen but it doesn't mean it's going to happen maybe one out of 50 trillion it's
[13:01.960 --> 13:08.560]  just completely made up remember Al Gore three years ago said that by 2009 the
[13:08.560 --> 13:12.760]  ice caps are going to completely melt it didn't happen they aim cameras at
[13:12.760 --> 13:16.720]  glaciers that always run out to the sea and in the spring always break off and
[13:16.720 --> 13:20.360]  fall into the water and they fear monger and tell everyone that the world is
[13:20.360 --> 13:25.640]  ending that's coming up and he got caught lying times of London the
[13:25.640 --> 13:29.600]  scientists who actually put out the report is saying that that's not what he
[13:29.600 --> 13:38.440]  said inconvenient truth for Al Gore as his north pole sums don't add up also the
[13:38.440 --> 13:43.640]  UN itself reports that natural disasters at a decade low in 2009 UN report
[13:43.640 --> 13:50.000]  from Reuters access to H1N1 vaccine easing as interest in shot range yeah
[13:50.000 --> 13:53.880]  people won't take it so they tried to create the artificial scarcity model to
[13:53.880 --> 13:57.760]  everybody to panic and run out and try to get it like the latest wind-up
[13:57.760 --> 14:03.480]  gerbil or cabbage patch doll or turbo doll or you know and we even have to see
[14:03.480 --> 14:08.160]  if our bragging that's what they did a big report from Sybil Edmonds it's up on
[14:08.160 --> 14:13.960]  infowars.com from Boiling Frogs secret reports secret budget secret operations
[14:13.960 --> 14:21.320]  secret courts a secret government so we'll be breaking some of that down on
[14:21.320 --> 14:29.800]  the war issue advisor trashes Blair over Iraq calls him a sycophant to
[14:29.800 --> 14:36.880]  Washington meanwhile the same sycophant gave a speech saying we must set up a
[14:36.880 --> 14:41.480]  global government and set up global taxes or we're all basically dead and
[14:41.480 --> 14:45.720]  that's coming up later in the broadcast as well continuing on the warfront US to
[14:45.720 --> 14:50.520]  expand drone attacks in the Pakistan cities times of London Benjamin Netanyahu
[14:50.520 --> 14:55.720]  must decide whether to strike Iran's nuclear facilities and is deciding right
[14:55.720 --> 15:02.320]  now US needs to tame debt soon experts say Reuters and the experts are all
[15:02.320 --> 15:07.960]  calling for a value-added tax and sales tax and income tax boost and Obama
[15:07.960 --> 15:12.880]  agrees and so the Republicans that we must have it so see and now Glenn Beck
[15:12.880 --> 15:16.360]  and everybody saying we must have new taxes and you're a communist if you're
[15:16.360 --> 15:21.640]  against them yes yes yes don't let the liberals stop you from taxes they be
[15:21.640 --> 15:30.920]  conservative salute Mao Zedong everything is the opposite of reality with
[15:30.920 --> 15:34.760]  these people how about we not let the government that tripled under Bush and
[15:34.760 --> 15:38.960]  more than quadrupled the first year under Obama more than all presidents before
[15:38.960 --> 15:46.360]  him combined four trillion dollar deficit this year and growing more than
[15:46.360 --> 15:54.560]  all presidents before and combined with interest and don't worry I'm now a
[15:54.560 --> 16:02.080]  liberal a commie because I'm against increasing taxes to the public's all
[16:02.080 --> 16:07.120]  about labels now you tell them turning your guns in drinking deadly fluoride
[16:07.120 --> 16:12.200]  to brain damage and sterilize yourself is conservative wearing shea guvara
[16:12.200 --> 16:16.320]  t-shirt t-shirts is conservative you'd see conservatives all running around a
[16:16.320 --> 16:22.360]  shea guvara t-shirts because they call it conservative and now Glenn Beck as
[16:22.360 --> 16:25.840]  usual shows himself along with all rightly wanting new taxes that we have to
[16:25.840 --> 16:31.160]  have the liberals don't want it oh well if you don't want to be thrown in the
[16:31.160 --> 16:35.320]  briar patch I'll be sure and throw you in there when that's exactly where briar
[16:35.320 --> 16:41.360]  rabbit wants to go you ever read the tale of briar rabbit and the briar patch
[16:41.360 --> 16:46.240]  hey guys I bet Wikipedia has a rundown of it the story of briar rabbit and the
[16:46.240 --> 16:50.280]  and the briar patch we search that and pull it up for me I want to get the
[16:50.280 --> 16:55.120]  character straight my dad reading that story to me several times when I was a
[16:55.120 --> 17:02.080]  little kid and explaining to me how people try to manipulate others I didn't
[17:02.080 --> 17:05.800]  really understand at the time boy I wish I had learned all those lessons when I
[17:05.800 --> 17:09.000]  was young but I guess you've got to go through it even though your parents try
[17:09.000 --> 17:14.320]  to warn you try to teach you you just have to experience it for yourself
[17:14.320 --> 17:26.680]  don't you okay that's just some of the news that I have in front of me today but
[17:26.680 --> 17:29.800]  what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna suspend covering news for now I'm gonna play all
[17:29.800 --> 17:34.080]  those video clips and cover the news starting in the second hour today but
[17:34.080 --> 17:38.840]  let's begin by going to your phone calls Rick in Florida first up welcome Alex
[17:38.840 --> 17:43.560]  it's a pleasure and an honor to talk to you sir thanks for waking me up listen
[17:43.560 --> 17:49.160]  I'm a beginning 9-11 truth activist and I would this morning try to watch loose
[17:49.160 --> 17:56.240]  change in American coup but YouTube is blocking parts four and five could you
[17:56.240 --> 18:02.760]  explain why they're doing that and and I also want to ask you can you update us
[18:02.760 --> 18:07.040]  on the 9-11 truth movement the New York City can initiative where do we stand
[18:07.040 --> 18:13.800]  and what's our next move okay let me let me answer that for you I produce because
[18:13.800 --> 18:19.040]  they asked for my help loose change final cut and we have that film available
[18:19.040 --> 18:24.240]  at info wars.com loose change American coup has a nice voiceover by Daniel
[18:24.240 --> 18:30.240]  Sinjata but really it's the first chapters that were cut out of with a
[18:30.240 --> 18:33.760]  few interviews and I think it's fine and dandy but I have nothing to do with that
[18:33.760 --> 18:41.680]  I have nothing to do with that I know that against my wishes some of the
[18:41.680 --> 18:46.480]  parties involved with loose change final cut did not want it free on the
[18:46.480 --> 18:52.000]  internet I did and lobbied for it to be free so I would imagine that that they're
[18:52.000 --> 18:57.800]  taking those down but I don't know I mean that's their decision that's why I
[18:57.800 --> 19:01.840]  tend to just make my own films I've because it's good to just be that's
[19:01.840 --> 19:07.520]  why you don't see my films in stores I put a few films in stores a few
[19:07.520 --> 19:17.440]  previous films and then was pressured to not have them available free and I went

[24:39.920 --> 24:45.280]  getting through so welcome there's a you've been talking about the war
[24:45.280 --> 24:50.640]  jumping beat and it is I just I want to bring to your attention three articles
[24:50.640 --> 24:58.040]  that I have been penned today the head neocon William Crystal he penned an
[24:58.040 --> 25:04.440]  article in the December 21st let's do out in December 21st issue the weekly
[25:04.440 --> 25:08.680]  standard it's a Nobel war speech did Obama lay the groundwork for a strike
[25:08.680 --> 25:15.280]  against Iran yes the neocons are all praising Obama but of course they are
[25:15.280 --> 25:19.200]  he's funded by the exact same Wall Street banks that funded them he kept the
[25:19.200 --> 25:24.920]  same Secretary of Defense it's just a huge sickening betrayal and joke but
[25:24.920 --> 25:28.720]  dumb liberals get to feel like they're in power so now they love war and death
[25:28.720 --> 25:32.080]  and banker raping and that's why they're gonna lose everything they've got and
[25:32.080 --> 25:35.480]  then when a Republican gets in office Republicans won't care if they're
[25:35.480 --> 25:39.560]  corrupt and bad because they get to feel like their winners and part of the
[25:39.560 --> 25:45.320]  power structure and that's why we're in so much trouble and also a congresswoman
[25:45.320 --> 25:52.680]  Eilina Ross late lefty and left me in of Florida penned it Iran where it hurts
[25:52.680 --> 26:00.320]  and as well as in the London Times I believe it was the article is secret

[26:46.400 --> 26:58.240]  know if you know or not but is there a group are there people anywhere we seem
[26:58.240 --> 27:01.720]  to think there's millions who know what we know and believe what we believe
[27:01.720 --> 27:09.640]  there are well I want to I need a contact number a contact point an email a
[27:09.640 --> 27:17.240]  website something to get a hold of some of these people so that we are not alone
[27:17.240 --> 27:22.440]  I'm well for about three years sure sure for about three years I've been trying
[27:22.440 --> 27:28.200]  just to get my operation built up to have a big enough office to be set up to
[27:28.200 --> 27:34.640]  where I can set up a proper type of kind of meetup for people that love
[27:34.640 --> 27:40.280]  freedom and hate tyranny and we are working on that now but the biggest
[27:40.280 --> 27:46.640]  thing sir is if you just wear anti-new order t-shirts if you just and walk
[27:46.640 --> 27:51.840]  around the streets of where you live if you start a local website and you know
[27:51.840 --> 27:58.760]  call it patriot news slash your town I mean if you do something like that it

[28:49.560 --> 28:54.080]  if that great success I don't think they're omnipresent and the average cop
[28:54.080 --> 28:58.680]  is waking up as well but listen I appreciate your call Tracy and I hear
[28:58.680 --> 29:03.440]  your point and I'm gonna work even harder not because it is my job
[29:03.440 --> 29:07.200]  responsibility but because nobody else is doing it to make sure that happens and
[29:07.200 --> 29:10.720]  I've got a bunch of ideas and I've just got to put them into place and I got to
[29:10.720 --> 29:17.200]  crack some whips around here to get it done believe me believe me and I am
[29:17.200 --> 29:24.040]  cracking the whip but everybody then critiques me and says well Alex needs to
[29:24.040 --> 29:29.600]  do this well Alex needs to do that I'm trying as best I can sir you're not
[29:29.600 --> 29:33.080]  gonna save the world by yourself you're not gonna find any perfect silver

[33:41.120 --> 33:47.560]  studio in the last year but an even bigger studio I finally got super awesome
[33:47.560 --> 33:54.680]  bandwidth in here hey Matt what's the bandwidth that we have now I know it's
[33:54.680 --> 34:03.040]  it's 60 megabits a second it's a fiber optic cable big around as your thumb I'm
[34:03.040 --> 34:12.520]  told that's pretty powerful what's that I know but the but but the cable it's in
[34:12.520 --> 34:17.720]  as big is that all just guarding the human air so there's a bunch of fibers
[34:17.720 --> 34:22.560]  so I was right the cable coming in here is a big round as your thumb or bigger I
[34:22.560 --> 34:27.640]  know I can look at the cable and tell you it's big so how many fiber optics are
[34:27.640 --> 34:36.160]  there in there 40 or more well I tell you we had to twist some arms and pay some
[34:36.160 --> 34:41.320]  money to get them to string that in here and put that in here this time warner
[34:41.320 --> 34:44.920]  said oh you can have all the roadrunner cable you want yeah yeah and this is we

[35:12.640 --> 35:19.920]  believe me four years ago I knew we needed a social networking three years
[35:19.920 --> 35:25.600]  ago I started trying to put that plan into function but making films writing
[35:25.600 --> 35:29.680]  the articles setting up the radio interviews I mean you just run out of
[35:29.680 --> 35:34.880]  time and I get call after call after call after call after call after call

[35:41.520 --> 35:45.320]  when I do set up social networking it's gonna stay on there at your own risk
[35:45.320 --> 35:54.400]  because there's no way that it's gonna be completely safe nothing is on the
[35:54.400 --> 36:00.960]  internet nothing is in real life and I guarantee people are gonna complain I
[36:00.960 --> 36:07.560]  met this guy on your website and he's a jerk how dare you but look I understand
[36:07.560 --> 36:12.080]  that criticism doesn't bother me other than the fact it bothers me that you
[36:12.080 --> 36:19.640]  criticize what we're doing when we are the leaders and and and that isn't saying
[36:19.640 --> 36:24.800]  much but we're the leaders and take an action I mean earlier I talked about
[36:24.800 --> 36:31.760]  helm I have had several big distribution deals where I was sought out by
[36:31.760 --> 36:39.680]  major distributors where it wasn't some made-up Hollywood deal most stuff in
[36:39.680 --> 36:42.880]  Hollywood or an entertainment is a bunch of people around a table promising
[36:42.880 --> 36:50.000]  each other the moon and then none of it happens 99% of the time but no I mean
[36:50.000 --> 36:59.880]  I've had on paper more money than I have ever made combined wanting to buy up my
[36:59.880 --> 37:05.680]  entire catalog of films and put them in stores and I knew that Ventura had been
[37:05.680 --> 37:11.440]  paid three million dollars a year for a three-year contract on MSNBC he thought
[37:11.440 --> 37:14.960]  it was a great deal he signed it but it said for the three years he couldn't do
[37:14.960 --> 37:18.160]  any other media unless they said then they laughed at him and said you're not
[37:18.160 --> 37:23.160]  going on TV we know your anti-war this is basically meant to shut you down so
[37:23.160 --> 37:29.440]  when I saw something like that I said hmm millions of dollars to to to not be
[37:29.440 --> 37:35.280]  able to get my films out free on the internet I mean I could literally be in
[37:35.280 --> 37:40.160]  Maui right now in a mansion out there paddling around with my children they
[37:40.160 --> 37:44.920]  would certainly like it a lot better but no instead I'm here
[37:48.240 --> 37:55.160]  and I'm doing it my way and believe me the establishment doesn't like it but I
[37:55.160 --> 38:03.040]  have been approached over and over and over again to sell out I mean in this
[38:03.040 --> 38:15.000]  case I even told you that I was approached by Universal their documentary
[38:15.000 --> 38:19.280]  division and said yeah we want to buy your whole catalog and it was just a
[38:19.280 --> 38:23.280]  super good deal too and you know it wasn't them even trying to buy me off
[38:23.280 --> 38:27.720]  probably it was just oh these are popular films we'll put we'll repackage
[38:27.720 --> 38:33.120]  these we'll sell them we'll put them out and it was the best deal I ever got
[38:33.120 --> 38:40.520]  offered 50% a profit 50 had the lawyers look at it they said this contract is
[38:40.520 --> 38:46.920]  unbelief best thing we've ever seen best things in sliced bread I said no
[38:49.560 --> 38:55.720]  now for all you talkers out there you ever turned down two million three
[38:55.720 --> 39:02.360]  million five million you ever turned down a check for five million dollars you
[39:02.360 --> 39:10.480]  ever done that you ever had major corporations offering you the moon and
[39:10.480 --> 39:19.600]  really can deliver it can you turn it down would you turn it down so that you
[39:19.600 --> 39:22.840]  could give your videos out for free and be screamed at and hated in the process
[39:22.840 --> 39:28.200]  knowing that it was doing the right thing I said I'm going back to your
[39:28.200 --> 39:33.720]  calls and I am it's just that subject gets brought up of documentaries and
[39:33.720 --> 39:37.680]  films we're changing the world ladies and gentlemen that's what I want to do I
[39:37.680 --> 39:42.040]  want a better future for humanity and that's why the establishment hates me
[39:42.040 --> 39:49.000]  and that's why they try to pull me down with through their co-intel pro and say
[39:49.000 --> 39:53.560]  I'm not real because they know that if you model after what I've done and know
[39:53.560 --> 39:58.640]  that I am real and that you are real and that we can affect change together and
[39:58.640 --> 40:03.560]  that if we discover we have power and that we can have victory and if people
[40:03.560 --> 40:07.280]  learn that there are really heroes alive in the world you're looking at one in
[40:07.280 --> 40:13.840]  the mirror look in the mirror that's gonna be the hero you decide you you're
[40:13.840 --> 40:23.120]  it you're all we've got the big secret is it's not even hard to turn down all
[40:23.120 --> 40:27.640]  that money once you've stepped through to the other side of liberty and
[40:27.640 --> 40:31.640]  patriotism and freedom and telling the truth and being honorable they can
[40:31.640 --> 40:38.240]  literally offer me a billion dollars and I wouldn't even think about selling out
[40:38.240 --> 40:49.280]  I've been offered TV show after TV show after TV show and I don't mean Hollywood
[40:49.280 --> 40:54.160]  fakes calling up and offering me television shows I don't mean talk I
[40:54.160 --> 41:00.600]  mean contracts and I've said no because I wouldn't have creative control over it
[41:00.600 --> 41:08.680]  I've said no because it's oh we're gonna offer you a show where you investigate
[41:08.680 --> 41:12.680]  Bigfoot and you get two million dollars a year how does that sound we're ready to
[41:12.680 --> 41:19.320]  do this right now and that is a way to torpedo what I've done oh yeah Alex Jones
[41:19.320 --> 41:22.320]  he was good he was fighting the New World Order he was fighting the private
[41:22.320 --> 41:28.160]  banks but now he's that big star on TV that investigates ghosts and goblins
[41:28.160 --> 41:35.200]  and hauntings and Bigfoot I've been offered millions on paper to walk away
[41:35.200 --> 41:41.560]  from all this and go live in Beverly Hills and leave all of the FBI infested
[41:41.560 --> 41:46.240]  patriot movement to chew each other's guts out and the establishment can't
[41:46.240 --> 41:51.920]  stand it that I've never taken the bait so what do they do they have Cointel
[41:51.920 --> 41:58.800]  Pro come out and lie and say Genesis is owned by ABC total lie that's like if you
[41:58.800 --> 42:07.400]  drive a Ford car it's saying you or Henry Ford and wrote the International Jew
[42:07.800 --> 42:12.960]  because of out of the five satellites we've leased one of them was an ABC
[42:12.960 --> 42:16.360]  satellite how do you think you get to radio stations how do you think your
[42:16.360 --> 42:19.560]  cell phone talks to somebody if you're in Albuquerque in New Mexico how do you
[42:19.560 --> 42:23.000]  think you talk to somebody in New York City it's cheap it's down to like a
[42:23.000 --> 42:28.920]  thousand bucks now was 5,000 a few years ago any of you could call and anyone
[42:28.920 --> 42:33.520]  could go I'll even give my Cointel Pro enemies and ideas you could go and go
[42:33.520 --> 42:38.800]  oh no look he's on all these satellites now what does it even matter what
[42:38.800 --> 42:44.280]  matters is my message is true the information is powerful the information
[42:44.280 --> 42:49.040]  is accurate the information is authoritative the information teaches
[42:49.040 --> 42:53.120]  you that you have power believe me the establishment doesn't want you to know
[42:53.120 --> 42:59.320]  that anyone with a thimble of discernment knows this radio shows the real
[42:59.320 --> 43:06.120]  deal but then there are lies that have no basis in reality they have people come
[43:06.120 --> 43:14.520]  out and say oh some Saudi Arabian owns Genesis complete total lie get emails
[43:14.520 --> 43:22.320]  every day saying you must answer for this answer for what totally made up they
[43:22.320 --> 43:26.560]  say on the internet that Ted Anderson owns some porno magazine called Genesis
[43:26.560 --> 43:31.680]  why should I respond to a complete line it says on the internet I'm a billionaire
[43:31.680 --> 43:38.280]  industrialist from Canada not true why should I respond to it because there's
[43:38.280 --> 43:44.200]  a 50-something-year-old guy with Scientology named Alex Jones I am that man
[43:44.200 --> 43:50.120]  they say I'm not but it doesn't matter websites say I have a radio show with a
[43:50.120 --> 43:55.000]  New York Times are right for the New York Times a radio show on NPR it's not
[43:55.000 --> 43:59.240]  true so what people say it
[43:59.240 --> 44:07.760]  people lie they lie incessantly and we've tracked it back to government
[44:07.760 --> 44:14.720]  operatives in most cases because they don't want you to have any faith they
[44:14.720 --> 44:19.240]  want you to think if you start a local community website standing up for
[44:19.240 --> 44:24.840]  freedom and liberty that you're going to be SWAT team when you're not 99%
[44:24.840 --> 44:32.120]  chance you will definitely live under tyranny if you don't stand up though see
[44:32.120 --> 44:36.480]  because if if I can stand up if I can be for real if I can stand up and make
[44:36.480 --> 44:41.720]  headway against the New World Order then we must have hope humanity might be
[44:41.720 --> 44:45.680]  able to make a stand against this tyranny but if the establishment can put
[44:45.680 --> 44:49.520]  out that I'm a fed or I work for the Catholic Church or I work for the
[44:49.520 --> 44:58.680]  Israelis or I work for Scientologists or I work for this or that if the feds can
[44:58.680 --> 45:05.720]  put that out and we have federal manuals we have the Co and tell pro manuals we
[45:05.720 --> 45:08.440]  have what the Southern Primary Law Center has been caught doing we know they do
[45:08.440 --> 45:16.600]  this we have army manuals of how they do this in third world countries but the
[45:16.600 --> 45:21.400]  good news is it's not working because people have become wise to it but I
[45:21.400 --> 45:26.680]  will say this again I can't start all the websites I can't do everything for
[45:26.680 --> 45:33.320]  you don't use Alex Jones as an excuse for not standing up that either a I'm
[45:33.320 --> 45:40.640]  going to save you or B if I just did things right I could save you or C I'm
[45:40.640 --> 45:45.080]  a fed so you need to just sit there in your apartment of your house and do
[45:45.080 --> 45:51.040]  nothing okay let's just say I am the ultimate evil I am the creature from
[45:51.040 --> 45:56.120]  hell I am the creature from the black lagoon I'm the thing that hides under
[45:56.120 --> 46:02.560]  your bed at night I am horrible let's just establish that I'm horrible that I
[46:02.560 --> 46:09.680]  am the worst creature on the planet let's just establish it let's just
[46:09.680 --> 46:16.800]  establish it for everybody okay now what are you going to do about auditing
[46:16.800 --> 46:19.640]  and abolishing the Federal Reserve what are you going to do about stopping the
[46:19.640 --> 46:22.760]  government from attacking Iran and telling them you don't want that to
[46:22.760 --> 46:28.400]  happen and starting World War three what are you going to do to get them to
[46:28.400 --> 46:30.800]  not start World War three with the Russians which they've been trying to do
[46:30.800 --> 46:34.640]  with 888 what are you going to do to get fluoride out of your local water
[46:34.640 --> 46:40.480]  supply fluoride the catch-all term for over 150 chemicals at the minimum the
[46:40.480 --> 46:47.120]  maximum over 300 that city water supplies add to the water that you drink
[46:47.120 --> 46:54.200]  under the name of dental health when all the studies show sterilization in all
[46:54.200 --> 47:05.040]  mammal species in reduced infertility or increased infertility and sterilization I
[47:05.040 --> 47:08.760]  mean that's the subject see you don't want to face it though in the
[47:08.760 --> 47:13.200]  establishment understands the lazy mind the drugged-out mind the chemicalized
[47:13.200 --> 47:17.360]  mind people that want to rationalize people that want to make excuses people
[47:17.360 --> 47:20.440]  that don't have faith in themselves people that don't imagine themselves as
[47:20.440 --> 47:28.600]  leaders and so see if you can just spend all your time saying Alex Jones is bad
[47:28.600 --> 47:34.960]  and Alex Jones is evil or if you can conversely just say it's one group that
[47:34.960 --> 47:39.080]  runs everything and one group that's evil and then obsess over that all day
[47:39.080 --> 47:43.720]  and attack everyone who doesn't only spend their time attacking one group if
[47:43.720 --> 47:51.600]  you can do that you've got people divided and conquered what I want to do
[47:51.600 --> 48:04.440]  now is I want to play some of the audio clips I want to play some of the
[48:04.440 --> 48:08.040]  questions that have been coming in the last few days to the listener comment
[48:08.040 --> 48:11.760]  line and then I'll comment on these and then this segment the next and then I'm
[48:11.760 --> 48:18.440]  going to continue with a bill Kevin Annie Hartwell Lynn and others on the
[48:18.440 --> 48:22.200]  other side as we start the next hour then I'm going to break down all the
[48:22.200 --> 48:26.240]  latest financial news climategate news police state news war news government
[48:26.240 --> 48:34.840]  takeover of health care news but let's go ahead and go to the next clip here it
[48:34.840 --> 48:43.160]  is hey Alex this change from New York apparently they are going to be forcing
[48:43.160 --> 48:50.400]  this bloody climate legislation down our throat whether we like it or not is there
[48:50.400 --> 48:54.160]  any way that we can find out what that these people are on because obviously
[48:54.160 --> 49:00.800]  they don't care about us I mean they're shoving it down our throats that I mean
[49:00.800 --> 49:05.360]  the EPA these are the same people that said it was safe to breathe around downtown
[49:05.360 --> 49:10.440]  Manhattan after 9-11 are now saying that greenhouse gases are the biggest
[49:10.440 --> 49:14.280]  threat of course they're the biggest threat if you breathe them in high enough
[49:14.280 --> 49:21.240]  doses they're right on that but they're wrong at the amounts okay keep up the
[49:21.240 --> 49:31.960]  good work man well actually if you were breathing 50% carbon dioxide it wouldn't
[49:31.960 --> 49:36.760]  hurt you as long as you were getting the rest in oxygen I mean a human trace
[49:36.760 --> 49:45.880]  amounts of carbon dioxide that we put off is what one two thousandth is that
[49:45.880 --> 49:50.680]  or less than one two thousandth is the numbers I saw me it's just so ridiculous
[49:50.680 --> 49:54.840]  when you know basic science but I have an article here with the IPCC has ruled
[49:54.840 --> 50:00.240]  the Sun has quote no effect on climate change I mean that's that's as
[50:00.240 --> 50:04.920]  ridiculous as saying water has nothing to do with being with with the ocean I
[50:04.920 --> 50:13.720]  mean it's just and yes the EPA rules that arsenic and cyanide in your water is
[50:13.720 --> 50:18.720]  okay and that melamine is good for babies not just bad for them or not just
[50:18.720 --> 50:26.920]  okay it's good for them so does the FDA and yes they said that of course their
[50:26.920 --> 50:31.840]  internal reports that this is deadly poison asbestos concrete glass all these
[50:31.840 --> 50:39.040]  other chemicals but they said tell the public it's good and they said see
[50:39.040 --> 50:47.320]  Hile you got a bunch of psychopathic criminals running the system and you've
[50:47.320 --> 50:51.920]  got a nation of childlike fools that think they're important and powerful
[50:51.920 --> 50:56.840]  waddling around having no idea just how serious things are we'll come back place

[54:09.480 --> 54:15.720]  Alex I want to know why it is not mentioned anywhere that if health care
[54:15.720 --> 54:20.800]  they want to control the cost of health care or any other care that they're
[54:20.800 --> 54:25.200]  measuring the cost in federal reserve notes and if the federal reserve notes
[54:25.200 --> 54:30.800]  collapsing how could they lower the cost of anything I know I just wish they
[54:30.800 --> 54:35.040]  would announce that out there Alex or you can announce it the federal reserve
[54:35.040 --> 54:40.120]  note collapses they can't lower the cost of anything and it drives me that's
[54:40.120 --> 54:49.520]  thank you Alex well thank you and that's a good point it's all a fraud see
[54:49.520 --> 54:55.000]  when you hit the final stages of looting that's why Bush tripled government
[54:55.000 --> 55:03.880]  in eight years and Obama close to quadrupled that in less than a year so
[55:03.880 --> 55:12.080]  more money than all presidents combined forty-three presidents back to George
[55:12.080 --> 55:19.840]  Washington Obama spends more than George W. Bush Bill Clinton George Bush's
[55:19.840 --> 55:31.440]  daddy Ronald Reagan Jimmy Carter Richard Nixon LBJ John F. Kennedy the
[55:31.440 --> 55:39.040]  White D. Eisenhower Harry Truman Franklin Delano Roosevelt all the way
[55:39.040 --> 55:49.600]  back through Lincoln and Andrew Jackson and Thomas Jefferson all presidents
[55:49.600 --> 55:58.720]  combined he did that eight months eight and a half months in now we're 11 months
[55:58.720 --> 56:05.480]  in about to be a year in January 21st
[56:07.120 --> 56:12.920]  see you're hearing that they're federalizing all local police forces
[56:12.920 --> 56:16.760]  the average cop hadn't been told yet and they're face scanning you everywhere
[56:16.760 --> 56:22.560]  you go and they're using spy satellites to track citizens and that they're
[56:22.560 --> 56:25.880]  building prisons everywhere because that's all that's going to be left we're
[56:25.880 --> 56:32.440]  going into the worst kind of bondage so of course you're not gonna get Medicare

[56:41.800 --> 56:47.840]  for the IMF and World Bank will go on interest to banks and then they're gonna
[56:47.840 --> 56:51.800]  get even more debt where you default and they just fully take over everything and
[56:51.800 --> 56:55.240]  that's already happening with the national parts and the ports and remember
[56:55.240 --> 56:59.520]  a couple years ago with Dubai world about to get 26 ports and Bush said look
[56:59.520 --> 57:04.520]  we got to give it to them they own our dollars this is all we got left they took
[57:04.520 --> 57:09.360]  the greatest inventing nation the greatest savings nation the most wealthy
[57:09.360 --> 57:12.880]  nation on earth and we're now the greatest debtor nation in 50 years
[57:12.880 --> 57:18.480]  that's living under the bankers and listen the good times are gone you think
[57:18.480 --> 57:25.440]  stuff's bad now just wait and the mind control is so great they're gonna tell

[57:35.520 --> 57:46.400]  worse and worse because the bankers are in control and no one will stop them no
[57:46.400 --> 57:50.720]  one will speak out against them people still only care about Dallas Cowboys

[57:55.640 --> 57:59.680]  we are literally in the grip of absolute ruthless criminals who openly admit
[57:59.680 --> 58:04.640]  their criminals and admit they've set up a paramilitary North com police force to
[58:04.640 --> 58:12.320]  suppress the people I mean this is an organized criminal heist and the cops

[1:00:27.200 --> 1:00:31.720]  on average there's still a lot of wonderful people in this country but you
[1:00:31.720 --> 1:00:36.480]  look at Mexico you look at North Korea those people individually are smart
[1:00:36.480 --> 1:00:42.160]  hard-working but they have a slave attitude of putting up with corruption
[1:00:42.160 --> 1:00:47.600]  thinking corruption's cute going along with the system and so they are
[1:00:47.600 --> 1:00:53.320]  completely enslaved and now we're going to be slaves unless we have an awakening
[1:00:53.320 --> 1:00:59.360]  and there isn't much time left and a lot of you like tyranny and think it's cute

[1:01:15.320 --> 1:01:20.840]  into complete bondage it'd be like if somebody had kidnapped you and was
[1:01:20.840 --> 1:01:24.360]  chaining you up to torture you to death and then and I've read accounts for
[1:01:24.360 --> 1:01:27.680]  women finally fought back and escaped a lot of times women get a gun pulled on
[1:01:27.680 --> 1:01:30.960]  them they get put in a car finally when they see they're gonna get tortured to
[1:01:30.960 --> 1:01:35.560]  death they finally fight back and get free and now they're there they're
[1:01:35.560 --> 1:01:39.080]  untying your arms and threatening you with a big knife and about to put you
[1:01:39.080 --> 1:01:44.360]  in handcuffs and if they get you strapped up to the wall you're dead and
[1:01:44.360 --> 1:01:48.840]  you're in a you're in a basement there's some dead bodies hanging up on
[1:01:48.840 --> 1:01:51.960]  meat hooks around you you can see where the globalist have killed people
[1:01:51.960 --> 1:01:55.320]  worldwide and taken over they brag about how they're gonna kill you they're
[1:01:55.320 --> 1:01:57.520]  telling you they're gonna kill you they're telling you they're gonna rape you
[1:01:57.520 --> 1:02:02.080]  and hurt you and are you gonna just sit there and timidly take it a lot of you
[1:02:02.080 --> 1:02:07.880]  feel like you're part of it you have kind of the moonshowson syndrome am I
[1:02:07.880 --> 1:02:12.480]  getting that mixed up is it moonshowson by proxy what's the one they found where
[1:02:12.480 --> 1:02:17.960]  people get kidnapped or taken captive like Patty Hearst actually came out she
[1:02:17.960 --> 1:02:21.720]  was a fed I predicted that has been declassified now that was all staged but
[1:02:21.720 --> 1:02:25.480]  but a lot of them get get kidnapped and then they end up joining the evil and
[1:02:25.480 --> 1:02:28.400]  that's what it is with the cops in the military I mean they're scared to death
[1:02:28.400 --> 1:02:32.480]  of it at a subconscious level and their subconscious mind makes the split second
[1:02:32.480 --> 1:02:42.000]  calculation to join the evil Craig will you pull up moonshowson by proxy I may
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:45.280]  be mixing that up with the one where women hurt their kids to get attention
[1:02:45.280 --> 1:02:52.160]  what that's moonshowson by proxy that's where they hurt their kids what's the
[1:02:52.160 --> 1:02:56.120]  Stockholm syndrome Stockholm syndrome is what it's called I knew I was getting
[1:02:56.120 --> 1:03:00.600]  it wrong I do that a lot I get things backwards or twisted around but didn't
[1:03:00.600 --> 1:03:06.800]  my brain telling me no that's wrong error error howl 9000 error error error and
[1:03:06.800 --> 1:03:14.200]  oh yes just a moment just a moment Stockholm syndrome that's what I'm
[1:03:14.200 --> 1:03:20.440]  talking about okay let's go another call here just getting warmed up let's talk
[1:03:20.440 --> 1:03:24.680]  to Bill in Vegas bill you're on the air hey Alex you know you got me terrified
[1:03:24.680 --> 1:03:30.320]  of attacking space toads now well if we don't pay Al Gore attacks it's over yes
[1:03:30.320 --> 1:03:34.960]  what are we gonna do but listen I got into a debate speaking of lies that have
[1:03:34.960 --> 1:03:39.400]  no basis in reality I got into a debate with a local radio host here in Vegas
[1:03:39.400 --> 1:03:43.440]  on the air about 9-11 and he was just on all kinds of ridiculous lies he's
[1:03:43.440 --> 1:03:47.000]  saying that Silverstein when he said pull it he was referring to cables that
[1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:50.960]  were holding up building seven because it was leaning over and he was saying
[1:03:50.960 --> 1:03:54.560]  that the film was sped up on building seven and saying this like it's fact
[1:03:54.560 --> 1:03:59.840]  you know by the way NIST admits that it did fall at freefall speed and that's
[1:03:59.840 --> 1:04:04.480]  that I mean also he was lying he's he's a liar right and then he said then this
[1:04:04.480 --> 1:04:07.800]  is why I'm calling because he said when your name came up he said that you were
[1:04:07.800 --> 1:04:13.320]  caught three times using phony people as witnesses from the Pentagon who claimed
[1:04:13.320 --> 1:04:16.720]  to work at the Pentagon during 9-11 and I didn't know what to say to him now I
[1:04:16.720 --> 1:04:20.400]  want to call back this new world order well that's just totally I don't even
[1:04:20.400 --> 1:04:24.120]  know what he's talking about it's completely made up I want to call him
[1:04:24.120 --> 1:04:27.120]  back on Saturday and tell him you know I spoke to you personally and it's a
[1:04:27.120 --> 1:04:32.520]  crock well there have been straw men built now that I think about it there
[1:04:32.520 --> 1:04:36.840]  was one guy who claimed he was a taxi driver who saw some things and he was a
[1:04:36.840 --> 1:04:40.240]  taxi driver there and we interviewed him and then later he recanted under
[1:04:40.240 --> 1:04:44.280]  threats so I guess that could be I mean we've certainly investigated a lot of
[1:04:44.280 --> 1:04:48.200]  things some of it didn't pan out but I mean does he really believe not one but
[1:04:48.200 --> 1:04:52.800]  two passports fell out of the north and south tower unburned and we're both
[1:04:52.800 --> 1:04:58.680]  found by the FBI in the first day I mean I mean I mean if he believes that he
[1:04:58.680 --> 1:05:02.120]  believes in blood-rinking space toads this is Alex Jones with five good

[1:08:13.320 --> 1:08:20.360]  hour and I'm going to go to Kevin Annie Hartwell Lynn Andrew and others here in
[1:08:20.360 --> 1:08:27.880]  just a few minutes there have been a lot of big developments on the global
[1:08:27.880 --> 1:08:32.080]  government establishment front with the Copenhagen situation we'll be breaking
[1:08:32.080 --> 1:08:37.760]  that down also I want to once we're live on television and I can give you audio
[1:08:37.760 --> 1:08:41.560]  play-by-play for radio listeners I want to play several video clips of what
[1:08:41.560 --> 1:08:48.160]  Al Gore's UN thugs do when anyone dare try talk to him they just grab your
[1:08:48.160 --> 1:08:51.600]  microphone away it doesn't matter if you're at a press conference it doesn't
[1:08:51.600 --> 1:08:55.000]  matter if you're a member of the press it doesn't matter if you try to talk to
[1:08:55.000 --> 1:09:00.840]  the IPCC it doesn't matter you do not criticize them or they run up and grab
[1:09:00.840 --> 1:09:09.000]  you I mean this is worse than communist China press is allowed to go to
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:13.840]  communist Chinese press conferences but if you do criticize the government or do
[1:09:13.840 --> 1:09:17.800]  something they just revoke they revoke your visa and kick you out of the country
[1:09:17.800 --> 1:09:23.680]  but rarely they allow I mean I've got an article here where Australia in their
[1:09:23.680 --> 1:09:27.440]  own words has now remember they started the test a year ago to see if it work
[1:09:27.440 --> 1:09:31.880]  they're installing Chinese style net censorship and I remember reading the
[1:09:31.880 --> 1:09:37.280]  original policy report it was to quote shut down anti-globalization groups they
[1:09:37.280 --> 1:09:42.840]  tell the public it's about keeping kids safe from porn and the government says
[1:09:42.840 --> 1:09:47.280]  that groups complain and then you get banned and blocked out nationwide and
[1:09:47.280 --> 1:09:51.080]  they're saying oh it's being looked at in England and Europe and the US and
[1:09:51.080 --> 1:09:57.880]  Canada now and they're putting in the NSA hubs to carry out the censorship and
[1:09:57.880 --> 1:10:02.200]  saying they may do it within one year remember a few months ago Obama said he
[1:10:02.200 --> 1:10:07.360]  may shut down the web during crises to make sure only accurate info gets out
[1:10:07.360 --> 1:10:12.560]  of the people associated press Ron Paul last Friday here said he really thinks
[1:10:12.560 --> 1:10:17.080]  they plan to shut the web down that's a quote he says they are planning to shut
[1:10:17.080 --> 1:10:21.520]  it down because he knows how to read what they are saying they are broaching
[1:10:21.520 --> 1:10:27.720]  it the average person is like oh no they'd never do that yeah they never
[1:10:27.720 --> 1:10:36.520]  passed the hate crime legislation would they either okay I'm done I want to go
[1:10:36.520 --> 1:10:39.640]  to your phone calls but once a month Marty Schachter of Calvin Pierce soap
[1:10:39.640 --> 1:10:43.640]  company pops in for five six minutes with us and I wanted to talk to Marty
[1:10:43.640 --> 1:10:50.480]  since he got back from World War two in the chemical core he noticed that there
[1:10:50.480 --> 1:10:52.960]  was no more real soap on the store shelves when he got back to Oakland
[1:10:52.960 --> 1:10:56.960]  California started Calvin Pierce soap with his daddy and now his son and his
[1:10:56.960 --> 1:11:04.880]  son run it 62 years later coming up on 63 years and you could never buy it
[1:11:04.880 --> 1:11:08.320]  until what five six years ago when he became a Genesis sponsor because it was
[1:11:08.320 --> 1:11:13.600]  only factory direct mainly to the rich and famous and to institutions that are
[1:11:13.600 --> 1:11:20.040]  smart you don't think David Rockefeller bathes in detergent toxic waste

[1:13:16.320 --> 1:13:19.900]  government says that's a conspiracy theory I'm I'm sorry Marty the point is
[1:13:19.900 --> 1:13:23.400]  you're bringing up conspiracy theories about grandparents now come on there's
[1:13:23.400 --> 1:13:27.960]  no such thing as pure organic soap I've got to have toxic distillates from the

[1:13:44.360 --> 1:13:50.320]  overseas this is something which people don't know they outsource the chemicals
[1:13:50.320 --> 1:13:54.760]  to make to get it cheaper and charge more in the space and if you think the
[1:13:54.760 --> 1:13:59.600]  Chinese put toxins in there just wait oh it's unbelievable what's going on in

[1:17:08.880 --> 1:17:14.040]  joke remember a year and a half ago it was coming out that babies were dying
[1:17:14.040 --> 1:17:17.480]  by the thousands in China and hundreds were getting sick here but our doctors
[1:17:17.480 --> 1:17:21.160]  know how to cover it up because of the government doesn't tell them it was
[1:17:21.160 --> 1:17:27.040]  melamine and they don't report it just all your your 15 month old's got kidney
[1:17:27.040 --> 1:17:32.040]  failure oh you don't know why put them on dialysis keep drinking that store-bought
[1:17:32.040 --> 1:17:40.920]  formula and then it came out that 90 plus percent like that's the headline 90
[1:17:40.920 --> 1:17:46.920]  percent of formula has melamine in it like let me make sure on my memory on
[1:17:46.920 --> 1:17:51.600]  that Google 90 percent of formula has melamine I believe that's a Washington
[1:17:51.600 --> 1:17:58.720]  Post headline I know there's another Washington Post headline 50% of corn
[1:17:58.720 --> 1:18:01.480]  syrup products have high levels of mercury they don't know why it's not
[1:18:01.480 --> 1:18:05.720]  involved in manufacturing I know why it's added they love you so much and
[1:18:05.720 --> 1:18:11.440]  they're gonna take good care of you and your family but anyways it came out that
[1:18:11.440 --> 1:18:19.080]  that was going on and so the Food and Drug Administration just said you know
[1:18:19.080 --> 1:18:27.280]  what we're just going to say that melamine is now good for you you can
[1:18:27.280 --> 1:18:31.960]  pull that up you know melamine not bad for children may even be good here's a
[1:18:31.960 --> 1:18:36.640]  headline 90% of US infant formula may be contaminated with melamine FDA
[1:18:36.640 --> 1:18:42.880]  abruptly declares chemicals safe for babies oh and there's the Washington
[1:18:42.880 --> 1:18:50.280]  Post headline and I'm the conspiracy theorist I mean how dumb do they think
[1:18:50.280 --> 1:18:55.280]  the public is to X out that GE ad you got to go over the right hand corner and
[1:18:55.280 --> 1:18:58.400]  I'll do it for you yeah you see you got to close it see up in the corner I'll
[1:18:58.400 --> 1:19:04.600]  take close us full page ads so study finds high fructose corn syrup contains
[1:19:04.600 --> 1:19:13.560]  mercury and it says half of the 55 brand names high levels of mercury but hey
[1:19:13.560 --> 1:19:16.920]  that's okay because here's local news saying mercury is good for you here it
[1:19:16.920 --> 1:19:21.840]  is mercury containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two new
[1:19:21.840 --> 1:19:25.720]  studies in the journal pediatrics there have been whites by concerns that
[1:19:25.720 --> 1:19:29.280]  mercury based preservatives and vaccines might impair the neurological
[1:19:29.280 --> 1:19:33.400]  development of children these new studies suggest that the opposite that the
[1:19:33.400 --> 1:19:37.200]  preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental
[1:19:37.200 --> 1:19:43.400]  performance that CBS News locally but that was aired on every CBS channel in
[1:19:43.400 --> 1:19:47.040]  the country they carry news packages the videos already cut it's
[1:19:47.040 --> 1:19:52.240]  satellite it to him now it's interneted to him and then the news reader locally
[1:19:52.240 --> 1:19:56.640]  reads the script to give it a local view so mercury is good for you and you're
[1:19:56.640 --> 1:20:01.600]  a conspiracy theorist if you don't believe it we'll be right back studies
[1:20:01.600 --> 1:20:04.640]  have shown that many people do not get the proper vitamins and minerals
[1:20:04.640 --> 1:20:08.880]  necessary to maintain good health with so many places to choose from deciding

[1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:17.640]  underneath the Americans at home. I have tremendous influence on our president in
[1:21:17.640 --> 1:21:22.760]  Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of
[1:21:22.760 --> 1:21:27.800]  us as American citizens to pay attention. For the Republic identifies the
[1:21:27.800 --> 1:21:32.600]  enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying
[1:21:32.600 --> 1:21:37.320]  sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke,
[1:21:37.320 --> 1:21:41.280]  their arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who
[1:21:41.280 --> 1:21:45.120]  do we make the checkout to? Today seems like nobody does care and right now in

[1:24:09.560 --> 1:24:15.320]  Okay let's start going to phone calls as I build up towards the news blitz going
[1:24:15.320 --> 1:24:22.800]  live at prisonplanet.tv in the next segment. Right now let's go back to the
[1:24:22.800 --> 1:24:29.240]  calls and speak with Kevin in California. Kevin you're on the air go ahead.
[1:24:29.240 --> 1:24:33.600]  Hey Alex thanks for taking my call. I've been listening to you for about seven
[1:24:33.600 --> 1:24:39.200]  years of first-time caller. Welcome. Thanks. I wanted to say thank you for
[1:24:39.200 --> 1:24:42.920]  you know the information that you've given us over the years. You woke me up
[1:24:42.920 --> 1:24:49.240]  about 9-11 around 2002-2003. Many other issues. Thank you for that.
[1:24:49.240 --> 1:24:54.800]  Well I was going to say I wanted to comment on the fact you know people
[1:24:54.800 --> 1:24:59.280]  accuse you being agents stuff like that or whatever. I've through all my
[1:24:59.280 --> 1:25:02.680]  research and trying to background check you. I've found no empirical evidence of
[1:25:02.680 --> 1:25:09.720]  you being an agent or some bizarre connection to some nefarious group out
[1:25:09.720 --> 1:25:13.640]  there or so I haven't seen it. Yeah but well there's also a lot of fake stuff
[1:25:13.640 --> 1:25:20.160]  people put up to you know fake proof but the issue is or weird anecdotal stuff.
[1:25:20.160 --> 1:25:26.160]  The issue is let's just say I'm bad. Okay let's just say I'm bad. Now can we
[1:25:26.160 --> 1:25:30.200]  please fight the New World Order? Can we please fight for liberty and justice and
[1:25:30.200 --> 1:25:36.040]  freedom and smaller government instead of just obsessing over Alex Jones all day?
[1:25:36.040 --> 1:25:39.720]  Yeah the ad hominems don't really help much. I mean the proof is in the
[1:25:39.720 --> 1:25:44.640]  pudding proof is in the research. But why are we spending all our time
[1:25:44.640 --> 1:25:49.440]  researching Alex Jones? Why is that one of the biggest things on the internet
[1:25:49.440 --> 1:25:53.280]  is literally spending all day on me instead of fighting the globalist and
[1:25:53.280 --> 1:25:57.400]  I'm telling you most of it we've tracked back when we've looked at it to a
[1:25:57.400 --> 1:26:02.200]  government operation. They are actually countering us and I should be glad that
[1:26:02.200 --> 1:26:06.720]  they're countering me this way instead of just killing me. So I guess I want to
[1:26:06.720 --> 1:26:10.600]  say thank you to the globalist for not killing me and taking the nonviolent
[1:26:10.600 --> 1:26:17.160]  route for now. But unfortunately for me it's ineffective so they may try some
[1:26:17.160 --> 1:26:20.640]  other things soon but that's just the way it is. But go ahead sir do you have
[1:26:20.640 --> 1:26:24.200]  any points or questions about the bigger wider universe and not the guy
[1:26:24.200 --> 1:26:29.800]  sitting in Austin Texas? Sure I'd be happy to. I had the question and a
[1:26:29.800 --> 1:26:34.000]  small request. My question is I've been following your coverage of Lord
[1:26:34.000 --> 1:26:38.440]  Moncton and Mike Rivera's coverage of it and this whole climate
[1:26:38.440 --> 1:26:42.440]  issue. I've like obsessed on it for like three weeks to a month now and that's
[1:26:42.440 --> 1:26:50.040]  good a lot. I don't want to throw in a little how would it say wrench in this
[1:26:50.040 --> 1:26:56.720]  works or or a strawman. But is Lord Moncton's connection to like say the
[1:26:56.720 --> 1:27:02.120]  Knights of Malta, is that any reason for concern? Is that it does that blow up any
[1:27:02.120 --> 1:27:07.680]  red flag to anybody? I appreciate your call. Somebody sent me his Wikipedia
[1:27:07.680 --> 1:27:13.640]  page. I mean that that's a hospital group that the
[1:27:13.640 --> 1:27:19.520]  hospitalers set that up and I just don't believe all the statements that
[1:27:19.520 --> 1:27:23.680]  people make about how if somebody's a member of the Order of the Knights of
[1:27:23.680 --> 1:27:29.560]  Malta that they're this all powerful ruler. By the way I have the Catholic
[1:27:29.560 --> 1:27:37.080]  Church in my stack today where the Pope is calling for global sustainability and
[1:27:37.080 --> 1:27:43.480]  that means eugenics. That means shutting people's resources off. It's horrible. So
[1:27:43.480 --> 1:27:47.480]  I was going to get to that and criticize that. I do not believe the Catholic
[1:27:47.480 --> 1:27:53.480]  Church is at the apex or at the tip top of the pyramid of the New World Order.
[1:27:53.480 --> 1:27:57.520]  In fact that's a good question. That's an important thing to discuss. Maybe I
[1:27:57.520 --> 1:28:01.640]  should do a brief two or three minutes on that. What my research has shown is at
[1:28:01.640 --> 1:28:06.400]  the very top of the New World Order. But the Catholic Church is certainly right
[1:28:06.400 --> 1:28:12.560]  up there at the at the very top. It's groups at the top of each major
[1:28:12.560 --> 1:28:18.760]  organization that then actually create the very tip top of the pyramid. So it's
[1:28:18.760 --> 1:28:23.280]  kind of a catch-22. Yes the Catholic Church is at the top of the pyramid but
[1:28:23.280 --> 1:28:28.880]  no it isn't at the top of the pyramid in total because the globalists always want
[1:28:28.880 --> 1:28:32.080]  people to fight over one group. You know it's Jews at the top of the pyramid or
[1:28:32.080 --> 1:28:35.960]  it's Catholics at the top of the pyramid or it's the Queen of England at the top
[1:28:35.960 --> 1:28:42.000]  of the pyramid. When it is all of those the leaders of all the major groups the
[1:28:42.000 --> 1:28:46.560]  Communist Chinese leaders they go to the top of the pyramid meetings. You've got
[1:28:46.560 --> 1:28:52.120]  them all there together waging war against humanity working together behind
[1:28:52.120 --> 1:28:58.600]  the scenes. And the few rogue countries some are good some are bad but the
[1:28:58.600 --> 1:29:02.360]  countries you hear about that are rogue that are being attacked those are the
[1:29:02.360 --> 1:29:06.800]  nations that aren't under their control. That doesn't mean they're good either but
[1:29:06.800 --> 1:29:11.000]  they're not the big global power. They're not the real threat to you and I like
[1:29:11.000 --> 1:29:22.520]  Iran or Sudan or countries like that. There's only a handful of countries the
[1:29:22.520 --> 1:29:28.280]  new order doesn't control and you see the new order waging war against those
[1:29:28.280 --> 1:29:34.280]  countries to bring them down. Somalia I mean they've pretty much mopped up
[1:29:34.280 --> 1:29:40.000]  everything but but but that doesn't matter on the whole Lord Moncton question
[1:29:40.000 --> 1:29:45.760]  because the issue is Copenhagen defeating it but we can't defeat Copenhagen
[1:29:45.760 --> 1:29:51.940]  because we've got a nanny over the fact that he's a British Lord. We're on the
[1:29:51.940 --> 1:30:01.160]  March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. This is Alex
[1:30:01.160 --> 1:30:04.560]  Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecolablu atmospheric water generator

[1:31:02.480 --> 1:31:06.320]  should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate
[1:31:06.320 --> 1:31:10.080]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our
[1:31:10.080 --> 1:31:14.040]  new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[1:31:14.040 --> 1:31:18.440]  you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[1:31:18.440 --> 1:31:22.880]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[1:31:22.880 --> 1:31:27.600]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[1:31:27.600 --> 1:31:31.400]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[1:31:31.400 --> 1:31:35.040]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[1:31:35.040 --> 1:31:39.400]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[1:31:39.400 --> 1:31:42.520]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[1:31:42.520 --> 1:31:46.240]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you

[1:32:54.760 --> 1:32:56.760]  www.silverlungs.com
[1:32:56.760 --> 1:33:25.700]  www.silverlungs.com
[1:33:26.760 --> 1:33:32.760]  I'll guide you and protect you from up here
[1:33:33.760 --> 1:33:36.760]  Can you hear me?
[1:33:37.760 --> 1:33:39.760]  Can you hear me right?
[1:33:40.760 --> 1:33:42.760]  Can you hear me right?
[1:33:42.760 --> 1:33:45.760]  Can you hear me calling you?
[1:33:47.760 --> 1:33:50.760]  Can you hear me?
[1:33:51.760 --> 1:33:53.760]  Can you hear me right?
[1:33:53.760 --> 1:33:56.760]  I'm velling it up to the bar here
[1:33:57.760 --> 1:34:00.760]  I'm trying to get focused
[1:34:02.760 --> 1:34:08.760]  And trying to cover all this incredible news
[1:34:10.760 --> 1:34:12.760]  That is just so amazing
[1:34:12.760 --> 1:34:17.760]  What I'm going to do now, because I got a little bit behind the day like I always do, is I'm going to go to your phone calls
[1:34:17.760 --> 1:34:24.760]  And I'm going to try to take a lot of them, and the questions are always incredibly important, so then I tend to never get to your calls
[1:34:24.760 --> 1:34:33.760]  We are simulcasting this radio show right now at prismplanet.tv for prismplanet.tv members
[1:34:33.760 --> 1:34:36.760]  Don't forget, I've done this the last six years running
[1:34:37.760 --> 1:34:42.760]  Every Christmas, we give you five months free at prismplanet.tv
[1:34:42.760 --> 1:34:45.760]  It's more than five months, it comes out to five and a half months
[1:34:45.760 --> 1:34:51.760]  When you sign up for a year, you get five and a half months free, almost 50% off
[1:34:52.760 --> 1:35:02.760]  Or you can go do the trial, $5.95, it comes out to like $3, $3.25 I think, when you get the year discount per month
[1:35:02.760 --> 1:35:08.760]  And you get the live TV show slash radio show, you get better archives of the radio, better archives of the TV
[1:35:08.760 --> 1:35:14.760]  All my films in super high quality, my book, Paul Watson's book, by the way my book is just now going out of print
[1:35:14.760 --> 1:35:21.760]  Watson's is already out of print, never to be back in print, at least we don't intend to
[1:35:21.760 --> 1:35:31.760]  Because my office used to be so messy, I don't have the original computer files, they're somewhere around here to reprint them
[1:35:31.760 --> 1:35:37.760]  Plus I don't have the money to reprint a book, because after a book's been out a while it really doesn't sell very good anymore
[1:35:37.760 --> 1:35:42.760]  The point is, is that there's a lot of stuff at prismplanet.tv
[1:35:42.760 --> 1:35:47.760]  And when you get a 15 cent a day membership, it's even less when you sign up during Christmas
[1:35:47.760 --> 1:35:53.760]  And six computers can simultaneously log on with the same username and passcode
[1:35:53.760 --> 1:35:58.760]  So you can give yourself a gift of prismplanet.tv, and then create a username and passcode
[1:35:58.760 --> 1:36:03.760]  And give it to your friends, your family, couple of your neighbors
[1:36:03.760 --> 1:36:08.760]  The chances that six of them will log on simultaneously is
[1:36:08.760 --> 1:36:13.760]  We just want it to be used, we want people to be educated, it's an armory of resistance
[1:36:13.760 --> 1:36:18.760]  You can download the films, burn them to disc, the last four or five films we have in Divx version
[1:36:18.760 --> 1:36:25.760]  Really good quality, you can burn to regular CDs that play in all the new DVD players and most of the old ones
[1:36:25.760 --> 1:36:28.760]  And on computers
[1:36:28.760 --> 1:36:36.760]  And you can go to prismplanet.tv and just start burning, fall the republic, in game, terror storm, truth rising
[1:36:36.760 --> 1:36:41.760]  The Obama deception to disc and giving it to people
[1:36:41.760 --> 1:36:47.760]  We've also got specials running through Christmas of where you get fall the republic or the Obama deception
[1:36:47.760 --> 1:36:52.760]  You get a free in game or a free Obama joker t-shirt
[1:36:52.760 --> 1:36:58.760]  Those deals only last as long as the supplies last and we are running out of the joker t-shirts
[1:36:58.760 --> 1:37:03.760]  And so as we run out of different versions of the joker t-shirt, we've added some other t-shirts up there
[1:37:03.760 --> 1:37:12.760]  So no matter what your size is, you can get the free t-shirts at infowars.com
[1:37:12.760 --> 1:37:17.760]  Okay
[1:37:17.760 --> 1:37:23.760]  Coming up after calls, again I'm going to get to these video clips of UN censorship
[1:37:23.760 --> 1:37:27.760]  I'm going to get to the latest on climate gate and the global government establishment
[1:37:27.760 --> 1:37:30.760]  The good news is Copenhagen is in deep trouble
[1:37:30.760 --> 1:37:34.760]  It's falling apart even better than I thought it would
[1:37:34.760 --> 1:37:39.760]  The death star's explosion is a little bit prettier from a distance than I even thought it would be
[1:37:39.760 --> 1:37:43.760]  Seeing the real thing is just...
[1:37:43.760 --> 1:37:50.760]  It's like seeing a beautiful woman on television is not like seeing one in person where you can smell them
[1:37:50.760 --> 1:37:55.760]  Watching the New World Order blow a gasket
[1:37:55.760 --> 1:38:02.760]  They're down, but they're not out, but let me tell you watching them bleed in the ditch is certainly quite a feast for the eyes
[1:38:02.760 --> 1:38:07.760]  Craig Saddler is just having a field day laughing in there
[1:38:07.760 --> 1:38:10.760]  That's good, what's so funny?
[1:38:10.760 --> 1:38:15.760]  Oh, you just...
[1:38:15.760 --> 1:38:19.760]  Well, you know what? Women are God's gift to the planet
[1:38:19.760 --> 1:38:22.760]  I mean, why not just admit we like women?
[1:38:22.760 --> 1:38:27.760]  Oh, like start getting into that
[1:38:27.760 --> 1:38:30.760]  I just have some fun here
[1:38:30.760 --> 1:38:34.760]  Oh, the blessings are so good
[1:38:34.760 --> 1:38:37.760]  Alright, that's enough
[1:38:37.760 --> 1:38:41.760]  That's enough ladies and gentlemen, I said I'm taking your phone calls
[1:38:41.760 --> 1:38:45.760]  I start thinking about Copenhagen on fire and burning
[1:38:45.760 --> 1:38:48.760]  I do tend to get a little...
[1:38:48.760 --> 1:38:52.760]  Well, I'm having endorphins flow right now, just like your Super Bowl team wins
[1:38:52.760 --> 1:38:55.760]  You've been a fan of...
[1:38:55.760 --> 1:38:59.760]  Say the Patriots for a decade and they won the Super Bowl, you get all excited
[1:38:59.760 --> 1:39:02.760]  That's your primitive synapses firing
[1:39:02.760 --> 1:39:08.760]  It's fooled your body to believe your tribe has just had some victory over an enemy army that was going to kill you
[1:39:08.760 --> 1:39:10.760]  and drag your women and children off
[1:39:10.760 --> 1:39:15.760]  And so you just won the battle, you're feeling good
[1:39:15.760 --> 1:39:18.760]  But it's not real, it's over, something doesn't matter
[1:39:18.760 --> 1:39:21.760]  But I start having victory chills
[1:39:21.760 --> 1:39:23.760]  I'm having them right now
[1:39:23.760 --> 1:39:25.760]  My hair is even standing out
[1:39:25.760 --> 1:39:28.760]  Like my French bulldog when it gets excited
[1:39:28.760 --> 1:39:31.760]  The rough sticks out
[1:39:31.760 --> 1:39:36.760]  My hair is actually standing up on end with excitement
[1:39:36.760 --> 1:39:39.760]  Because I can taste victory
[1:39:39.760 --> 1:39:44.760]  I can just feel the new world order having its power sapped and drained
[1:39:44.760 --> 1:39:49.760]  So it's still powerful, but I liken it to 2001 Space Odyssey
[1:39:49.760 --> 1:39:55.760]  When the commander's gotten into the crawl space and he's turning the Hal 9000 off
[1:39:55.760 --> 1:40:01.760]  And it's going, I'm afraid, Dave, I'm afraid and he's just focused, just turning it off
[1:40:01.760 --> 1:40:05.760]  It takes a long time to defeat the new world order
[1:40:05.760 --> 1:40:09.760]  Just like it took them a long time to get their system going
[1:40:09.760 --> 1:40:13.760]  But it's like a big sandcastle they've built, they've spent weeks building it
[1:40:13.760 --> 1:40:17.760]  There's a lot of high tides coming in and washing it out
[1:40:17.760 --> 1:40:21.760]  They're like piling sand up as fast as they can and it doesn't matter
[1:40:21.760 --> 1:40:24.760]  The tides coming in on them
[1:40:24.760 --> 1:40:30.760]  Oh, excuse me, sorry, sorry
[1:40:30.760 --> 1:40:34.760]  There's a lot of bad stuff happening too, but when we start having big victories
[1:40:34.760 --> 1:40:40.760]  I'm going to break down the big victory, but all right, Annie, Hartwell, Lynn, Brandon, Curtis
[1:40:40.760 --> 1:40:42.760]  I'm out of control, I'm going to air in a moment
[1:40:42.760 --> 1:40:47.760]  The last caller called in and with hushed reverence
[1:40:47.760 --> 1:40:55.760]  He said, Alex, do you mind if I speak to you about Knights of Malta
[1:40:55.760 --> 1:41:00.760]  And it's almost like the Monty Python when they jump out and they go
[1:41:00.760 --> 1:41:03.760]  The Spanish Inquisition
[1:41:03.760 --> 1:41:06.760]  In fact, can you pull that up on YouTube?
[1:41:06.760 --> 1:41:09.760]  Monty Python, the Spanish Inquisition
[1:41:09.760 --> 1:41:16.760]  It's not like it's the Spanish Inquisition
[1:41:16.760 --> 1:41:20.760]  But yes, I know Lord Moncton's a Lord
[1:41:20.760 --> 1:41:23.760]  And he's a member of a whole bunch of fraternal organizations
[1:41:23.760 --> 1:41:28.760]  And he is a hereditary peer, he's Scottish
[1:41:28.760 --> 1:41:34.760]  And he's always had an anti-socialism, anti-New World Order, anti-global government bent
[1:41:34.760 --> 1:41:37.760]  He's anti-European Union
[1:41:37.760 --> 1:41:41.760]  Yes, he is a Catholic, but there's different branches of the Catholics
[1:41:41.760 --> 1:41:47.760]  The Catholic Church is involved, Rome is, big time with pushing the European Union
[1:41:47.760 --> 1:41:49.760]  That is true
[1:41:49.760 --> 1:42:00.760]  And the Dutch Prince Bernhard and Joseph Reddinger and others were involved with the Jesuits
[1:42:00.760 --> 1:42:03.760]  And are involved trying to set up that empire
[1:42:03.760 --> 1:42:06.760]  And the Catholic Church is right up there, part of the pyramid
[1:42:06.760 --> 1:42:09.760]  There, I've talked about it forever
[1:42:09.760 --> 1:42:11.760]  They say he will never discuss it, he will never talk about it
[1:42:11.760 --> 1:42:14.760]  It doesn't matter, you judge a tree by its fruits
[1:42:14.760 --> 1:42:17.760]  It's like Glenn Beck, I would love to support Glenn Beck
[1:42:17.760 --> 1:42:22.760]  But the guy says we need to have value-added taxes and there are no FEMA camps and Ron Paul's bad
[1:42:22.760 --> 1:42:25.760]  And then his supporters calling, I've never heard him say that
[1:42:25.760 --> 1:42:28.760]  Well, you must not be paying attention then
[1:42:28.760 --> 1:42:31.760]  All I hear is good stuff out of Lord Moncton's mouth
[1:42:31.760 --> 1:42:34.760]  And he's there covering it, and we get him on and talk about it
[1:42:34.760 --> 1:42:37.760]  And he writes devastatingly accurate
[1:42:37.760 --> 1:42:40.760]  There it is over here
[1:42:40.760 --> 1:42:43.760]  Detailed reports about what's happening
[1:42:43.760 --> 1:42:45.760]  The fruit off this tree is good
[1:42:45.760 --> 1:42:49.760]  If Lord Moncton was an apple tree, it's like a honeycrest
[1:42:49.760 --> 1:42:55.760]  You know those big juicy apples, I mean Lord Moncton is like, oh man, this isn't really good
[1:42:55.760 --> 1:42:59.760]  This guy has done a lot of good work in his life, fighting tyranny
[1:42:59.760 --> 1:43:03.760]  And so you judge a tree by its fruits, I mean look
[1:43:03.760 --> 1:43:08.760]  The biggest thing is people think that everyone in every system is evil
[1:43:08.760 --> 1:43:12.760]  And I've always talked about compartmentalization
[1:43:12.760 --> 1:43:25.760]  Saul of Tarsus was a Sanhedrin enforcer for the Jewish religious hardcore Sadducees and Pharisees
[1:43:25.760 --> 1:43:31.760]  And he would go around killing people all over Greece and all over Turkey
[1:43:31.760 --> 1:43:37.760]  And all over Rome and all over Italy and all over Judea
[1:43:37.760 --> 1:43:42.760]  I mean, he was like Darth Vader, folks, hunting people down and killing them
[1:43:42.760 --> 1:43:45.760]  But then he woke up and had a revelation
[1:43:45.760 --> 1:43:52.760]  And you're going to see that powerful people from inside the structure are who we want to stand up
[1:43:52.760 --> 1:43:56.760]  What is, uh, G. Edward Griffin talk about all the time
[1:43:56.760 --> 1:43:59.760]  We have to sell our idea of liberty and freedom
[1:43:59.760 --> 1:44:04.760]  And a lot of these people in the system aren't active or they don't understand the big picture
[1:44:04.760 --> 1:44:08.760]  And as they wake up and get educated, we're going to wake them up
[1:44:08.760 --> 1:44:13.760]  Instead, everybody, like half the people out there obsessed over
[1:44:13.760 --> 1:44:19.760]  Is the planet really run by aliens? Is it really run by Jews? Is it really run by Catholics?
[1:44:19.760 --> 1:44:23.760]  Is it really run by the Illuminati? Is it really run by?
[1:44:23.760 --> 1:44:30.760]  And if I could say anything to you, I only go off what I can prove
[1:44:30.760 --> 1:44:35.760]  And the Protestant leadership, the Catholic leadership, the Jewish leadership
[1:44:35.760 --> 1:44:41.760]  The Turkish leadership, the German leadership, the Japanese leadership, they all think the same
[1:44:41.760 --> 1:44:44.760]  We're the elites over our group
[1:44:44.760 --> 1:44:48.760]  We keep our groups in fear of the outside to give us power
[1:44:48.760 --> 1:44:50.760]  We feed off our groups
[1:44:50.760 --> 1:44:55.760]  We always give them an outside threat so they let us abuse them
[1:44:55.760 --> 1:45:02.760]  And we're social engineers who believe that we have a right to rule people
[1:45:02.760 --> 1:45:04.760]  And that's who the globalists are
[1:45:04.760 --> 1:45:11.760]  They use scientific systems of control to dominate populations
[1:45:11.760 --> 1:45:18.760]  And so you have a bunch of different pyramids coming up together at that tip top
[1:45:18.760 --> 1:45:23.760]  It isn't a Jewish conspiracy, it isn't a Catholic conspiracy, it isn't a Protestant conspiracy
[1:45:23.760 --> 1:45:27.760]  It isn't a Muslim conspiracy, it isn't an atheist conspiracy
[1:45:27.760 --> 1:45:33.760]  It is a power group conspiracy
[1:45:33.760 --> 1:45:38.760]  It is a scientific dictatorship of people that know how humans operate
[1:45:38.760 --> 1:45:45.760]  And who have set up scientific systems of control
[1:45:45.760 --> 1:45:49.760]  That's the bottom line
[1:45:49.760 --> 1:45:56.760]  And so you must oppose their systems, their global taxes, their global regulations
[1:45:56.760 --> 1:45:59.760]  Their federalization of your local police
[1:45:59.760 --> 1:46:04.760]  But if you go to a city council meeting and start talking about Jews
[1:46:04.760 --> 1:46:06.760]  Or start talking about Catholics
[1:46:06.760 --> 1:46:08.760]  Or start talking about Muslims
[1:46:08.760 --> 1:46:13.760]  Everybody has been trained that that's divide and conquer, they're not going to listen to what you say
[1:46:13.760 --> 1:46:22.760]  That's why the feds infiltrate groups and try to get them to be singular issue
[1:46:22.760 --> 1:46:26.760]  So you can be divided, this is their ball game
[1:46:26.760 --> 1:46:30.760]  And then once you're divided, they can threaten other groups with you
[1:46:30.760 --> 1:46:32.760]  And actually build up their power over here
[1:46:32.760 --> 1:46:37.760]  And then no one's ever covering the big picture
[1:46:37.760 --> 1:46:44.760]  I mean, supernatural powers are attributed to the Catholics
[1:46:44.760 --> 1:46:49.760]  And they're just all secret agents of the Vatican running around in black robes at night
[1:46:49.760 --> 1:46:55.760]  And people superimpose my head on Catholic priest robes and say I'm this top assassin
[1:46:55.760 --> 1:46:58.760]  I mean, it's just completely made up, folks
[1:46:58.760 --> 1:47:01.760]  I'm not Catholic, I'm nothing against Catholics
[1:47:01.760 --> 1:47:03.760]  My family are famous Protestants
[1:47:03.760 --> 1:47:07.760]  Captain Jones of the Mayflower on my dad's side, on my mother's side
[1:47:07.760 --> 1:47:10.760]  Two of the people on the Mayflower, direct descendants
[1:47:10.760 --> 1:47:14.760]  My family involved in founding Texas
[1:47:14.760 --> 1:47:17.760]  William Ayers came in with a shipload of Bibles
[1:47:17.760 --> 1:47:19.760]  Sold everything he owned in New York
[1:47:19.760 --> 1:47:23.760]  Because the Catholics were making people pledge to be Catholics to get land grants
[1:47:23.760 --> 1:47:28.760]  In Texas and the Protestants were, I mean, I am, come from famous Protestants, folks
[1:47:28.760 --> 1:47:31.760]  As pure a pedigree as it gets
[1:47:31.760 --> 1:47:36.760]  And then some Israeli operative group that wants to get patriots fighting with each other
[1:47:36.760 --> 1:47:41.760]  Says I work for the Vatican, it's just a, and then other weak-minded people just say it to sell books and stuff
[1:47:41.760 --> 1:47:45.760]  And I don't care about being attacked, it only makes me bigger
[1:47:45.760 --> 1:47:49.760]  And people actually come check me out and find out who I really am
[1:47:49.760 --> 1:47:56.760]  So in the bigger plan, God's plan, people attacking me actually only helps us
[1:47:56.760 --> 1:48:02.760]  But in the globalist plan, it's meant to get all of you in fighting
[1:48:02.760 --> 1:48:10.760]  So that you never activate as a leader and go out and warn people and take action on real issues
[1:48:10.760 --> 1:48:15.760]  It's meant to keep you chasing your tail
[1:48:15.760 --> 1:48:22.760]  So that you don't go, this is about me, Tom Jones or Bill Smith or
[1:48:22.760 --> 1:48:28.760]  Zach Johnson or whatever your name is
[1:48:28.760 --> 1:48:37.760]  Standing up as John Doe or Susie Q and going out and picking an issue and taking action
[1:48:37.760 --> 1:48:40.760]  It is the conspiracy theory, baloney
[1:48:40.760 --> 1:48:43.760]  I don't cover conspiracy theories here, folks
[1:48:43.760 --> 1:48:47.760]  I cover the real information, day in, day out
[1:48:47.760 --> 1:48:48.760]  Okay, let's go to your calls, I'm done
[1:48:48.760 --> 1:48:52.760]  No matter how good the calls are and how important the questions are, I just can't do calls like that
[1:48:52.760 --> 1:48:56.760]  Let's see if we can, we've never succeeded in taking call after call
[1:48:56.760 --> 1:48:58.760]  But let's see if we can succeed
[1:48:58.760 --> 1:49:01.760]  Annie in North Carolina, you're on the air
[1:49:01.760 --> 1:49:05.760]  Hi, yes, I was just wondering about defenses that's coming up next year
[1:49:05.760 --> 1:49:09.760]  When is it something that we should do or advise people to do?
[1:49:09.760 --> 1:49:12.760]  Well, ma'am, that's your option if you want to do it
[1:49:12.760 --> 1:49:17.760]  But it's a violation of the Fifth Amendment to make you incriminate yourself to answer dozens and dozens
[1:49:17.760 --> 1:49:19.760]  of questions depending on which form you get
[1:49:19.760 --> 1:49:21.760]  They randomly send out longer forms
[1:49:21.760 --> 1:49:27.760]  It's not their business if you own guns or what your stocks and bonds are or how big a flush toilet your toilet is
[1:49:27.760 --> 1:49:29.760]  I don't fill the census out
[1:49:29.760 --> 1:49:34.760]  And when the young punk bangs on my door and threatens me, I tell him, get off my property, they're trespassing
[1:49:34.760 --> 1:49:37.760]  I don't open the door for census takers
[1:49:37.760 --> 1:49:42.760]  They're banker, slave, grocers, they're to see what their slave's doing
[1:49:42.760 --> 1:49:46.760]  And they're training you to answer questions you don't have to answer
[1:49:46.760 --> 1:49:53.760]  But is it not held secret for 72 years?
[1:49:53.760 --> 1:50:04.760]  No, I'm just laughing because, no ma'am, the federal government admits they share all the census data with whoever they want
[1:50:04.760 --> 1:50:07.760]  Perfect, thank you
[1:50:07.760 --> 1:50:10.760]  Yeah, thank you, and the people that come to your door will just lie
[1:50:10.760 --> 1:50:13.760]  Most of them don't even know what planet they're on or how many continents there are
[1:50:13.760 --> 1:50:16.760]  I think polar bears can't swim, I mean, that's how dumb the public is
[1:50:16.760 --> 1:50:22.760]  Is Al Gore can tell them polar bears can't swim and the sun has nothing to do with heating the planet
[1:50:22.760 --> 1:50:27.760]  I mean, and people probably tune in right now and go, well, yeah, the news says it doesn't
[1:50:27.760 --> 1:50:31.760]  Mercury's good for you, melamine's good for children, and the sun doesn't heat the earth
[1:50:31.760 --> 1:50:33.760]  And penguins and polar bears can't swim
[1:50:33.760 --> 1:50:37.760]  I mean, why is it hard to figure this out?
[1:50:37.760 --> 1:50:39.760]  Why?
[1:50:39.760 --> 1:50:43.760]  I mean, I'm here saying don't drink mercury
[1:50:43.760 --> 1:50:46.760]  But is it true you're a veteran assassin?
[1:50:46.760 --> 1:50:49.760]  Do you guys ever find the clip of the Spanish Inquisition?
[1:50:49.760 --> 1:50:50.760]  We'll come back with that
[1:50:50.760 --> 1:51:10.760]  The Spanish Inquisition

[1:51:52.760 --> 1:51:56.760]  That's 1-866-380-2782
[1:51:56.760 --> 1:52:24.760]  Or call 1-866-380-2782
[1:52:24.760 --> 1:52:27.760]  The seed bank is not just a box of open pollinated seeds
[1:52:27.760 --> 1:52:30.760]  It's an indestructible, waterproof seed bank
[1:52:30.760 --> 1:52:33.760]  That can even be buried if we face a real meltdown
[1:52:33.760 --> 1:52:35.760]  And here's the best part
[1:52:35.760 --> 1:52:39.760]  All the seeds in the survival seed bank go through strict germination testing
[1:52:39.760 --> 1:52:42.760]  So you can be confident you're not buying old seeds

[1:52:47.760 --> 1:52:49.760]  That's survivalseedbank.com

[1:53:24.760 --> 1:53:26.760]  Free for a very limited time
[1:53:26.760 --> 1:53:28.760]  Here's Herb Kay
[1:53:28.760 --> 1:53:30.760]  Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies

[1:53:34.760 --> 1:53:35.760]  Herb Kay was right
[1:53:35.760 --> 1:53:38.760]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt
[1:53:38.760 --> 1:53:40.760]  What have you got to lose?

[1:54:03.760 --> 1:54:05.760]  I don't know, Mr. Wenworth just told me to come in here
[1:54:05.760 --> 1:54:07.760]  And say that there was trouble at the mill, that's all
[1:54:07.760 --> 1:54:10.760]  I didn't expect a kind of Spanish inquisition
[1:54:13.760 --> 1:54:16.760]  Nobody expects the Spanish inquisition
[1:54:16.760 --> 1:54:18.760]  Our chief weapon is surprise
[1:54:18.760 --> 1:54:20.760]  Surprise and fear, fear and surprise
[1:54:20.760 --> 1:54:22.760]  Our weapons are fear and surprise
[1:54:22.760 --> 1:54:23.760]  And ruthlessness efficiency
[1:54:23.760 --> 1:54:26.760]  Our three weapons are fear and surprise
[1:54:26.760 --> 1:54:27.760]  And ruthlessness efficiency
[1:54:27.760 --> 1:54:29.760]  And an almost fanatical devotion to the Pope
[1:54:29.760 --> 1:54:30.760]  Our four, no
[1:54:31.760 --> 1:54:33.760]  Amongst our weapons
[1:54:35.760 --> 1:54:38.760]  Amongst our weaponry are such elements as fear
[1:54:38.760 --> 1:54:39.760]  I'll come in again
[1:54:39.760 --> 1:54:47.760]  I didn't expect a kind of Spanish inquisition
[1:54:50.760 --> 1:54:53.760]  Nobody expects the Spanish inquisition
[1:54:53.760 --> 1:54:57.760]  Amongst our weaponry are such diverse elements as fear
[1:54:57.760 --> 1:54:59.760]  Surprise, ruthless efficiency
[1:54:59.760 --> 1:55:01.760]  And almost fanatical devotion to the Pope
[1:55:01.760 --> 1:55:02.760]  A nice red uniform
[1:55:04.760 --> 1:55:06.760]  I can't say what you're saying
[1:55:06.760 --> 1:55:07.760]  What?
[1:55:07.760 --> 1:55:09.760]  You have to say the bit about that chief weapon
[1:55:09.760 --> 1:55:11.760]  The red, white and blue
[1:55:12.760 --> 1:55:14.760]  The red, white and blue
[1:55:14.760 --> 1:55:15.760]  And when the band plays
[1:55:15.760 --> 1:55:16.760]  That was funny
[1:55:17.760 --> 1:55:18.760]  Okay
[1:55:20.760 --> 1:55:23.760]  Heartwell in Louisiana, you're on the air, welcome
[1:55:24.760 --> 1:55:27.760]  Alex, it's been over two years since I've talked with you
[1:55:27.760 --> 1:55:29.760]  And I'm calling you today to thank you
[1:55:29.760 --> 1:55:31.760]  For letting me make copies of your videos
[1:55:31.760 --> 1:55:35.760]  I have a DVD burner that burns four at one time
[1:55:35.760 --> 1:55:38.760]  I made many copies of all of your videos that I have
[1:55:38.760 --> 1:55:39.760]  And I have all of them
[1:55:40.760 --> 1:55:43.760]  And I want you to know that I give them away
[1:55:43.760 --> 1:55:45.760]  I never accept a donation
[1:55:45.760 --> 1:55:48.760]  So once again, thank you and may God protect you
[1:55:48.760 --> 1:55:49.760]  Well, thank you
[1:55:49.760 --> 1:55:52.760]  And let me just say I want to thank you for making copies of the film
[1:55:52.760 --> 1:55:54.760]  That's why we make them available
[1:55:55.760 --> 1:55:58.760]  And we want people to also certainly support themselves
[1:55:58.760 --> 1:55:59.760]  In what they're doing
[1:55:59.760 --> 1:56:02.760]  In the past, I even told people to take donations
[1:56:02.760 --> 1:56:04.760]  The problem is they then start selling them
[1:56:04.760 --> 1:56:07.760]  And then telling me I can't even sell my own films
[1:56:07.760 --> 1:56:09.760]  I never expected what some people would do
[1:56:09.760 --> 1:56:12.760]  But the power of you, the listeners, getting the documentaries
[1:56:12.760 --> 1:56:14.760]  Making copies, getting them out to people
[1:56:14.760 --> 1:56:16.760]  Has shaken the New World Order
[1:56:16.760 --> 1:56:18.760]  And we're only beginning to fight
[1:56:18.760 --> 1:56:21.760]  So thank you so much for taking the time and energy out to do that
[1:56:21.760 --> 1:56:23.760]  Anything else, Heartwell?
[1:56:23.760 --> 1:56:26.760]  I just want you to know that I can't do what you're doing
[1:56:26.760 --> 1:56:28.760]  But I'll do whatever I can
[1:56:28.760 --> 1:56:30.760]  Well, God bless you and good to hear from you, Heartwell
[1:56:30.760 --> 1:56:33.760]  Okay, let's talk to Lynn in Oklahoma
[1:56:33.760 --> 1:56:34.760]  Lynn, go ahead
[1:56:34.760 --> 1:56:37.760]  Yeah, Alex, I just wondered, did you happen to catch the speech
[1:56:37.760 --> 1:56:39.760]  That Dana Warbacher gave last week
[1:56:39.760 --> 1:56:41.760]  On the floor of the House of Representatives
[1:56:41.760 --> 1:56:44.760]  Or he called out the globalists and talked about global government
[1:56:44.760 --> 1:56:48.760]  I actually sat and watched the whole thing last week
[1:56:49.760 --> 1:56:51.760]  How long was it?
[1:56:51.760 --> 1:56:52.760]  How long was it?
[1:56:52.760 --> 1:56:53.760]  How long was it?
[1:56:54.760 --> 1:56:56.760]  30, maybe 45 minutes
[1:56:56.760 --> 1:56:59.760]  Yes, I did see a short clip of it
[1:56:59.760 --> 1:57:01.760]  Used to, that would have been wow
[1:57:01.760 --> 1:57:02.760]  Somebody's emitting world government
[1:57:02.760 --> 1:57:04.760]  Now everybody's admitting it
[1:57:04.760 --> 1:57:08.760]  Even the guy that Chuck Norris likes
[1:57:08.760 --> 1:57:14.760]  The former governor is coming out and talking about it
[1:57:14.760 --> 1:57:16.760]  And yes, I did see a short clip of it
[1:57:16.760 --> 1:57:17.760]  Tell us about it
[1:57:17.760 --> 1:57:18.760]  Well, it was interesting
[1:57:18.760 --> 1:57:20.760]  Because during the course of the speech
[1:57:20.760 --> 1:57:22.760]  He laid out this whole global warming fraud
[1:57:22.760 --> 1:57:28.760]  And he talked about the global cooling of the 1970s
[1:57:28.760 --> 1:57:32.760]  And how the alarm bells were being rung at that time
[1:57:32.760 --> 1:57:34.760]  He talked about his family
[1:57:34.760 --> 1:57:37.760]  And two or three different times
[1:57:37.760 --> 1:57:39.760]  He flat-out said, Americans, wake up
[1:57:39.760 --> 1:57:42.760]  And he did this on the floor of the House of Representatives
[1:57:42.760 --> 1:57:43.760]  Right on C-SPAN
[1:57:43.760 --> 1:57:44.760]  And I fell out of my chair
[1:57:44.760 --> 1:57:46.760]  I couldn't believe what I was hearing
[1:57:46.760 --> 1:57:48.760]  Guys, go to YouTube and type in Dana Warbacher
[1:57:48.760 --> 1:57:49.760]  Talks about New World Order
[1:57:49.760 --> 1:57:50.760]  I need that anyways
[1:57:50.760 --> 1:57:52.760]  I need Aaron to get that
[1:57:52.760 --> 1:57:54.760]  It's about a 30, maybe a 45-minute speech
[1:57:54.760 --> 1:57:57.760]  No, no, I actually saw a clip a few days ago
[1:57:57.760 --> 1:57:58.760]  That's the problem
[1:57:58.760 --> 1:58:00.760]  Is I spent all these hours researching
[1:58:00.760 --> 1:58:02.760]  And then I get up here on air
[1:58:02.760 --> 1:58:04.760]  And it's like piles every day
[1:58:04.760 --> 1:58:06.760]  And I'm like, how do I even start?
[1:58:06.760 --> 1:58:08.760]  But see, that's why I love taking calls
[1:58:08.760 --> 1:58:09.760]  You brought it up
[1:58:09.760 --> 1:58:11.760]  I didn't have time to watch the whole speech
[1:58:11.760 --> 1:58:13.760]  But yeah, that's the good news
[1:58:13.760 --> 1:58:15.760]  Is we can now actually have real discussions
[1:58:15.760 --> 1:58:16.760]  About what's really happening
[1:58:16.760 --> 1:58:19.760]  Very exciting, thank you, Lynn
[1:58:19.760 --> 1:58:25.760]  Brandon, Curtis, Francis, Josh, and others
[1:58:25.760 --> 1:58:27.760]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen
[1:58:27.760 --> 1:58:30.760]  With the start of the third and fourth hours
[1:58:30.760 --> 1:58:34.760]  And coming up, I'm going to get into
[1:58:34.760 --> 1:58:37.760]  UN censorship in Copenhagen
[1:58:37.760 --> 1:59:04.760]  And a lot more
[1:59:04.760 --> 1:59:12.760]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[1:59:12.760 --> 1:59:15.760]  As American citizens to pay attention
[1:59:15.760 --> 1:59:18.760]  Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[1:59:18.760 --> 1:59:20.760]  The criminal offshore cartel
[1:59:20.760 --> 1:59:22.760]  Hell bent on destroying sovereignty
[1:59:22.760 --> 1:59:25.760]  And on its ashes constructing world government
[1:59:25.760 --> 1:59:27.760]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists
[1:59:27.760 --> 1:59:29.760]  They're asking for more matches
[1:59:29.760 --> 1:59:31.760]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[1:59:31.760 --> 1:59:33.760]  Today seems like nobody does care
[1:59:33.760 --> 1:59:35.760]  And right now in Washington D.C.
[1:59:35.760 --> 1:59:38.760]  We have seen a fall of the Republic
[1:59:38.760 --> 1:59:40.760]  Yet you're copy of Full of the Republic
[1:59:40.760 --> 1:59:43.760]  On DVD at infowars.com
[1:59:43.760 --> 1:59:45.760]  We're watching online right now
[1:59:45.760 --> 2:00:10.760]  In super high quality at prisonplanet.tv
[2:00:10.760 --> 2:00:11.760]  You want answers?
[2:00:11.760 --> 2:00:13.760]  Well, so does he
[2:00:13.760 --> 2:00:17.760]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[2:00:17.760 --> 2:00:18.760]  And now
[2:00:18.760 --> 2:00:26.760]  It's like when the sun doesn't contribute to climate change
[2:00:26.760 --> 2:00:29.760]  The sunspots cycle
[2:00:29.760 --> 2:00:31.760]  When the sunspots go down
[2:00:31.760 --> 2:00:34.760]  That's the big storms
[2:00:34.760 --> 2:00:37.760]  Adjecting fireballs
[2:00:37.760 --> 2:00:39.760]  Thousands of times the size of the earth
[2:00:39.760 --> 2:00:42.760]  Can fit over a million planet earths inside the sun
[2:00:42.760 --> 2:00:45.760]  And the United Nations is in the news today
[2:00:45.760 --> 2:00:51.760]  Saying, no, the sun has nothing to do with our climate
[2:00:51.760 --> 2:00:53.760]  And polar bears can't swim, too
[2:00:53.760 --> 2:00:57.760]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, these people think you're idiots
[2:00:57.760 --> 2:01:01.760]  They think you are morons
[2:01:01.760 --> 2:01:06.760]  They think you are the biggest fools ever to walk the green earth
[2:01:06.760 --> 2:01:08.760]  Alright, I'm going to continue with phone calls
[2:01:08.760 --> 2:01:10.760]  And a little bit in the next segment
[2:01:10.760 --> 2:01:12.760]  I'm going to get into UN goons
[2:01:12.760 --> 2:01:16.760]  Silence journalists who questions Gore on climategate
[2:01:16.760 --> 2:01:20.760]  Carbon billionaire refuses to correct the record
[2:01:20.760 --> 2:01:23.760]  On statements regarding CRU emails
[2:01:23.760 --> 2:01:26.760]  That's the latest prisonplanet.com article
[2:01:26.760 --> 2:01:27.760]  By Steve Watson and Paul Watson
[2:01:27.760 --> 2:01:30.760]  You guys print that for me, thank you
[2:01:30.760 --> 2:01:31.760]  Then I'll run to the latest on climategate
[2:01:31.760 --> 2:01:33.760]  And a bunch of other news here
[2:01:33.760 --> 2:01:35.760]  That we haven't even gotten to yet
[2:01:35.760 --> 2:01:37.760]  On the war front, the economy front
[2:01:37.760 --> 2:01:41.760]  But right now, let's go back to your calls
[2:01:41.760 --> 2:01:46.760]  Let's talk to Brandon in Utah
[2:01:46.760 --> 2:01:48.760]  Brandon, you're on the air
[2:01:48.760 --> 2:01:50.760]  Hello, Mr. Jones
[2:01:50.760 --> 2:01:51.760]  Hey, buddy
[2:01:51.760 --> 2:01:53.760]  I was just wondering if you have reported on
[2:01:53.760 --> 2:01:56.760]  British court issues arrest warrant
[2:01:56.760 --> 2:02:00.760]  For Zipney Livny, Israeli foreign minister for war crimes
[2:02:00.760 --> 2:02:02.760]  If that's news to you or not
[2:02:02.760 --> 2:02:03.760]  No, it is news
[2:02:03.760 --> 2:02:05.760]  In fact, say the headline again
[2:02:05.760 --> 2:02:07.760]  British court issues arrest warrant
[2:02:07.760 --> 2:02:13.760]  For Zipney Livny, Israeli foreign minister for war crimes
[2:02:13.760 --> 2:02:16.760]  And yeah, I just watched a little video from
[2:02:16.760 --> 2:02:18.760]  I think it was from BBC
[2:02:18.760 --> 2:02:21.760]  Somebody on MySpace sent it to me
[2:02:21.760 --> 2:02:24.760]  So just thought maybe you might want to react to that
[2:02:24.760 --> 2:02:26.760]  If it's actually going to go through
[2:02:26.760 --> 2:02:30.760]  Because I think that Bush and Cheney
[2:02:30.760 --> 2:02:35.760]  Have also been issued warrants as well
[2:02:35.760 --> 2:02:38.760]  But whatever, I don't think anything's going to
[2:02:38.760 --> 2:02:39.760]  Come up about that
[2:02:39.760 --> 2:02:40.760]  Well, we'll look it up
[2:02:40.760 --> 2:02:42.760]  British court issues arrest warrant
[2:02:42.760 --> 2:02:44.760]  What was the rest of the headline?
[2:02:44.760 --> 2:02:46.760]  For war crimes
[2:02:46.760 --> 2:02:49.760]  Israeli foreign minister for war crimes
[2:02:49.760 --> 2:02:51.760]  All right, we'll pull that up
[2:02:51.760 --> 2:02:53.760]  No, no, I was not aware of that
[2:02:53.760 --> 2:02:56.760]  Definitely lying about WMDs
[2:02:56.760 --> 2:02:59.760]  Going into Iraq
[2:02:59.760 --> 2:03:02.760]  Killing over a million people conservatively
[2:03:02.760 --> 2:03:04.760]  According to the British Lancet Journal
[2:03:04.760 --> 2:03:07.760]  Which is nonpartisan
[2:03:07.760 --> 2:03:09.760]  Even the neocons admit that war crimes
[2:03:09.760 --> 2:03:12.760]  Have been committed
[2:03:12.760 --> 2:03:18.760]  And when predator drones blow up apartment buildings
[2:03:18.760 --> 2:03:20.760]  Whether it be the Israeli forces
[2:03:20.760 --> 2:03:22.760]  Or the US forces doing it
[2:03:22.760 --> 2:03:26.760]  And kill in some cases hundreds of innocent people
[2:03:26.760 --> 2:03:28.760]  That is terrorism
[2:03:28.760 --> 2:03:30.760]  Just like if the Muslims do it
[2:03:30.760 --> 2:03:31.760]  It's terrorism
[2:03:31.760 --> 2:03:33.760]  And I'm just tired of unequal justice
[2:03:33.760 --> 2:03:34.760]  In fact, you're right, sir
[2:03:34.760 --> 2:03:36.760]  There's the times of London
[2:03:36.760 --> 2:03:41.760]  Israeli fury over British war crimes warrant
[2:03:41.760 --> 2:03:45.760]  For Tezipi Lavinie
[2:03:45.760 --> 2:03:47.760]  I hope I'm pronouncing that right
[2:03:47.760 --> 2:03:49.760]  In fact, here's the article
[2:03:49.760 --> 2:03:51.760]  Guys, how would I pronounce then?
[2:03:51.760 --> 2:03:54.760]  Tezipi Lavinie
[2:03:54.760 --> 2:03:56.760]  Is that right?
[2:03:56.760 --> 2:03:59.760]  That's good
[2:03:59.760 --> 2:04:02.760]  So there have been these British warrants
[2:04:02.760 --> 2:04:05.760]  Issued before by mid-level and low-level courts
[2:04:05.760 --> 2:04:07.760]  And they've always been squashed
[2:04:07.760 --> 2:04:10.760]  So we'll see what happens with that
[2:04:10.760 --> 2:04:12.760]  And I've always told people
[2:04:12.760 --> 2:04:14.760]  This is going to turn into a sideshow
[2:04:14.760 --> 2:04:18.760]  Israel is being built up as the boogeyman
[2:04:18.760 --> 2:04:20.760]  It's very popular to do it
[2:04:20.760 --> 2:04:22.760]  President Carter does it
[2:04:22.760 --> 2:04:24.760]  Israel certainly engages in its share
[2:04:24.760 --> 2:04:27.760]  Of bad behavior and crimes
[2:04:27.760 --> 2:04:29.760]  But researching the new world order
[2:04:29.760 --> 2:04:31.760]  At its heart, there's something more there
[2:04:31.760 --> 2:04:34.760]  There's something deeper there
[2:04:34.760 --> 2:04:38.760]  And...
[2:04:38.760 --> 2:04:40.760]  So we'll see what happens on that front
[2:04:40.760 --> 2:04:42.760]  But I do think it's good
[2:04:42.760 --> 2:04:44.760]  It's good that these big modern militaries
[2:04:44.760 --> 2:04:46.760]  That are bombing and attacking
[2:04:46.760 --> 2:04:48.760]  People living in caveman-level existences
[2:04:48.760 --> 2:04:50.760]  Needs to stop
[2:04:50.760 --> 2:04:53.760]  So I wonder if they'll be issued war crimes
[2:04:53.760 --> 2:04:55.760]  With charges against Bush and Chaining
[2:04:55.760 --> 2:04:57.760]  Because boy, do they deserve it
[2:04:57.760 --> 2:05:26.760]  We'll be right back, stay with us
[2:05:27.760 --> 2:05:29.760]  And if you're a warantin and you can't feed yourself
[2:05:29.760 --> 2:05:31.760]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[2:05:31.760 --> 2:05:33.760]  You wipe out all these problems
[2:05:33.760 --> 2:05:35.760]  If you have a good food supply
[2:05:35.760 --> 2:05:38.760]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom
[2:05:38.760 --> 2:05:39.760]  And your life
[2:05:39.760 --> 2:05:41.760]  How much will you need? We don't know
[2:05:41.760 --> 2:05:43.760]  How much do you want? All you can get
[2:05:43.760 --> 2:05:44.760]  I'm Alex Jones
[2:05:44.760 --> 2:05:47.760]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day
[2:05:47.760 --> 2:05:51.760]  Call 1-800-409-5633
[2:05:51.760 --> 2:05:53.760]  Or check it out on the web
[2:05:53.760 --> 2:05:55.760]  At efoodsdirect.com
[2:05:55.760 --> 2:05:59.760]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633
[2:05:59.760 --> 2:06:00.760]  This is Alex Jones
[2:06:00.760 --> 2:06:02.760]  And I want to tell you about the
[2:06:02.760 --> 2:06:04.760]  Akola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator
[2:06:04.760 --> 2:06:05.760]  That produces pure drinking water
[2:06:05.760 --> 2:06:07.760]  Right from the humidity in the air
[2:06:07.760 --> 2:06:09.760]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real

[2:07:56.760 --> 2:08:23.760]  To see all the available discounts
[2:08:27.760 --> 2:08:30.760]  Brought up a headline
[2:08:30.760 --> 2:08:33.760]  Concerning an arrest warrant for an Israeli official
[2:08:33.760 --> 2:08:35.760]  Before I read the article I said
[2:08:35.760 --> 2:08:37.760]  It'll be rescinded by the court
[2:08:37.760 --> 2:08:40.760]  I've seen this happen multiple times
[2:08:40.760 --> 2:08:42.760]  It always creates a big flurry of interest
[2:08:42.760 --> 2:08:44.760]  Than it goes nowhere
[2:08:44.760 --> 2:08:47.760]  Israeli fury over British war crimes warrant
[2:08:47.760 --> 2:08:51.760]  For Tezipeh Lavini
[2:08:51.760 --> 2:08:54.760]  Israeli government issued an angry warning today
[2:08:54.760 --> 2:08:57.760]  That its ties with Britain were in jeopardy
[2:08:57.760 --> 2:08:59.760]  Over a UK arrest warrant briefly issued
[2:08:59.760 --> 2:09:02.760]  Against the Jewish state's opposition leader
[2:09:02.760 --> 2:09:04.760]  And former foreign minister
[2:09:04.760 --> 2:09:06.760]  Israel, the government of England
[2:09:06.760 --> 2:09:09.760]  Doesn't control its courts if they're impartial
[2:09:09.760 --> 2:09:12.760]  It has emerged that a London court issued a warrant
[2:09:12.760 --> 2:09:14.760]  At the weekend for alleged war crimes
[2:09:14.760 --> 2:09:17.760]  Committed last winter's Gaza offensive
[2:09:17.760 --> 2:09:20.760]  And rescinded it when it became clear
[2:09:20.760 --> 2:09:23.760]  That Tezipeh Lavini
[2:09:23.760 --> 2:09:25.760]  Was not on British soil
[2:09:25.760 --> 2:09:27.760]  So there you have it
[2:09:31.760 --> 2:09:33.760]  Okay, let me, like I said
[2:09:33.760 --> 2:09:35.760]  I would do finish up with the news
[2:09:35.760 --> 2:09:38.760]  Or finish up with your calls, then get into the news here
[2:09:38.760 --> 2:09:42.760]  Continuing, Curtis in Indiana, you're on the air, welcome
[2:09:42.760 --> 2:09:44.760]  Hey, I'll carry you
[2:09:44.760 --> 2:09:47.760]  I just want to say thank you for the things that you've done
[2:09:47.760 --> 2:09:50.760]  I saw an in-game about a year ago on the internet
[2:09:50.760 --> 2:09:53.760]  Ever since then, I've been in my studying and research
[2:09:53.760 --> 2:09:56.760]  And I appreciate everything you do, and God bless you
[2:09:56.760 --> 2:09:57.760]  Thank you
[2:09:57.760 --> 2:10:00.760]  And I just want to ask, does Codex Alimentary
[2:10:00.760 --> 2:10:04.760]  Is going to go into effect on December 31st this year?
[2:10:04.760 --> 2:10:07.760]  People for 20 years have been saying
[2:10:07.760 --> 2:10:09.760]  It's going into effect every year
[2:10:09.760 --> 2:10:12.760]  It's going into effect in increments
[2:10:12.760 --> 2:10:14.760]  Like a glacier grows
[2:10:14.760 --> 2:10:17.760]  The UN has these big consortium meetings
[2:10:17.760 --> 2:10:21.760]  Governments and private corporations sign agreements
[2:10:21.760 --> 2:10:26.760]  To go back and try to restrict minerals, vitamins
[2:10:26.760 --> 2:10:28.760]  And other things to the public
[2:10:28.760 --> 2:10:31.760]  And yes, they've agreed to try to implement
[2:10:31.760 --> 2:10:34.760]  Massive restrictions on all vitamins and minerals
[2:10:34.760 --> 2:10:36.760]  To make them prescription
[2:10:36.760 --> 2:10:38.760]  Big drug companies are now coming out
[2:10:38.760 --> 2:10:40.760]  With their prescription versions of vitamin E
[2:10:40.760 --> 2:10:43.760]  And vitamin B and fish oil
[2:10:43.760 --> 2:10:47.760]  And they have tried to raid alternative health places
[2:10:47.760 --> 2:10:49.760]  They are trying to shut them down
[2:10:49.760 --> 2:10:51.760]  They are trying to restrict
[2:10:51.760 --> 2:10:54.760]  And it's a process, but it's kind of like
[2:10:54.760 --> 2:10:57.760]  Seven years ago, Bush signed
[2:10:57.760 --> 2:11:00.760]  And Republicans went along with him and passed
[2:11:00.760 --> 2:11:05.760]  The so-called campaign finance reform
[2:11:05.760 --> 2:11:08.760]  Which increased the money corporations could give
[2:11:08.760 --> 2:11:10.760]  But restricted individuals
[2:11:10.760 --> 2:11:13.760]  So the public was told, though, this is going to stop
[2:11:13.760 --> 2:11:17.760]  And that law states that six weeks before an election
[2:11:17.760 --> 2:11:21.760]  I can't talk about politics as a radio host
[2:11:21.760 --> 2:11:23.760]  I can't have a pro-gun group on
[2:11:23.760 --> 2:11:25.760]  An anti-gun group on
[2:11:25.760 --> 2:11:31.760]  I can't have a politician on
[2:11:31.760 --> 2:11:33.760]  But everyone just ignores it
[2:11:33.760 --> 2:11:35.760]  It's clearly unconstitutional and a fraud
[2:11:35.760 --> 2:11:37.760]  It's like if the government passed a law today
[2:11:37.760 --> 2:11:39.760]  Saying, murder your firstborn
[2:11:39.760 --> 2:11:41.760]  Like many ancient cultures would do
[2:11:41.760 --> 2:11:44.760]  Is a test of power over the slaves
[2:11:44.760 --> 2:11:46.760]  Or when the slaves bred too much
[2:11:46.760 --> 2:11:49.760]  They would routinely kill children
[2:11:49.760 --> 2:11:50.760]  I mean, that's what governments do
[2:11:50.760 --> 2:11:51.760]  That's what eugenics is
[2:11:51.760 --> 2:11:52.760]  The public just hasn't figured out
[2:11:52.760 --> 2:11:55.760]  The more things change, the more they stay the same
[2:11:55.760 --> 2:11:59.760]  And so, you know, that's basically
[2:11:59.760 --> 2:12:00.760]  What's happening here
[2:12:00.760 --> 2:12:01.760]  Anything else?
[2:12:01.760 --> 2:12:03.760]  Well, I live in the Annapolis
[2:12:03.760 --> 2:12:05.760]  And they just recently put up that systems
[2:12:05.760 --> 2:12:08.760]  Where if a firearm gets shot
[2:12:08.760 --> 2:12:11.760]  They, um, they'll ping it
[2:12:11.760 --> 2:12:13.760]  And find out exactly where it's at
[2:12:13.760 --> 2:12:15.760]  And what type of weapon it is
[2:12:15.760 --> 2:12:16.760]  And it's going to cost their city
[2:12:16.760 --> 2:12:17.760]  Like $3 million before
[2:12:17.760 --> 2:12:19.760]  Yeah, it's total clackery
[2:12:19.760 --> 2:12:24.760]  Austin put that in in 1998
[2:12:24.760 --> 2:12:26.760]  But they've never busted anyone
[2:12:26.760 --> 2:12:28.760]  For discharging a firearm
[2:12:28.760 --> 2:12:31.760]  With the gun detection system
[2:12:34.760 --> 2:12:37.760]  What it is, is shotgun microphones on cameras
[2:12:37.760 --> 2:12:39.760]  And then you'll find that's hooked into
[2:12:39.760 --> 2:12:41.760]  Your local threat integration center
[2:12:41.760 --> 2:12:43.760]  Where they're openly merging it
[2:12:43.760 --> 2:12:45.760]  With the regular army and CIA
[2:12:45.760 --> 2:12:47.760]  This is all public now
[2:12:47.760 --> 2:12:49.760]  I've got the Rand Corporation report on it
[2:12:49.760 --> 2:12:51.760]  Here it is right here
[2:12:51.760 --> 2:12:54.760]  Total federalization of all police
[2:12:54.760 --> 2:12:57.760]  And just a fraud
[2:12:57.760 --> 2:13:00.760]  But I tell you, Indiana is way ahead of the times
[2:13:00.760 --> 2:13:03.760]  Indiana was the first state almost 20 years ago
[2:13:03.760 --> 2:13:05.760]  To put in license plate reading cameras
[2:13:05.760 --> 2:13:08.760]  Did you know that for more than 15 years
[2:13:08.760 --> 2:13:10.760]  Everywhere you go is tracked in Indiana?
[2:13:10.760 --> 2:13:12.760]  Yeah, I know, it's all, it's bad
[2:13:12.760 --> 2:13:14.760]  Everywhere downtown, anywhere
[2:13:14.760 --> 2:13:16.760]  You could see it all, all the cameras
[2:13:16.760 --> 2:13:17.760]  It's really bad here
[2:13:17.760 --> 2:13:19.760]  And one last thing I wanted to say
[2:13:19.760 --> 2:13:21.760]  Have you kind of noticed that the new
[2:13:21.760 --> 2:13:24.760]  Alcantus spokesman, the American Adam Gadon
[2:13:24.760 --> 2:13:26.760]  Well, of course, I mean
[2:13:26.760 --> 2:13:28.760]  We've written countless articles about it
[2:13:28.760 --> 2:13:30.760]  He, he, he, mm-hmm
[2:13:30.760 --> 2:13:32.760]  Dead
[2:13:32.760 --> 2:13:34.760]  Do you believe he is?
[2:13:34.760 --> 2:13:37.760]  Your phone cut out, say that again
[2:13:37.760 --> 2:13:39.760]  I believe Ben Laden is dead
[2:13:39.760 --> 2:13:41.760]  Oh, sure, sure, no, no
[2:13:41.760 --> 2:13:42.760]  Adam is
[2:13:42.760 --> 2:13:44.760]  Yeah, look, yeah, I gotta move on, Curtis
[2:13:44.760 --> 2:13:46.760]  I appreciate your call, I really do
[2:13:48.760 --> 2:13:51.760]  Adam Gadon hated Arabs so much
[2:13:51.760 --> 2:13:53.760]  He's Jewish
[2:13:53.760 --> 2:13:55.760]  He hated Arabs so much
[2:13:55.760 --> 2:13:58.760]  That he was arrested beating them up outside Mosque
[2:13:58.760 --> 2:14:02.760]  I mean, this guy was a super mega Zionist
[2:14:02.760 --> 2:14:04.760]  His
[2:14:04.760 --> 2:14:07.760]  Grandfather was one of the founders of the ADL
[2:14:07.760 --> 2:14:09.760]  One of their board members
[2:14:09.760 --> 2:14:12.760]  And he gets up there and apologizes
[2:14:12.760 --> 2:14:14.760]  That Alcantus is killing innocent people
[2:14:14.760 --> 2:14:16.760]  I mean, he's been caught when they upload it
[2:14:16.760 --> 2:14:19.760]  The Intel Center openly run by former heads of black ops
[2:14:19.760 --> 2:14:21.760]  From CIA, that's on record
[2:14:21.760 --> 2:14:24.760]  The Intel Center uploads Gadon videos
[2:14:24.760 --> 2:14:26.760]  And other videos in the same video layer
[2:14:26.760 --> 2:14:28.760]  As the Intel Center's bug
[2:14:28.760 --> 2:14:30.760]  The Intel Center's graphics
[2:14:30.760 --> 2:14:32.760]  They are producing it
[2:14:34.760 --> 2:14:36.760]  I mean, they were caught red handed
[2:14:38.760 --> 2:14:40.760]  We've blown their videos up here
[2:14:40.760 --> 2:14:42.760]  They've had video experts for Wired Magazine
[2:14:42.760 --> 2:14:44.760]  And others look at it
[2:14:44.760 --> 2:14:46.760]  You can blow up video layers
[2:14:46.760 --> 2:14:48.760]  If you've got a computer and look at it
[2:14:48.760 --> 2:14:51.760]  And it's done on the same layer
[2:14:51.760 --> 2:14:53.760]  The same generation
[2:14:53.760 --> 2:14:55.760]  The pixel shapes change per generation
[2:14:55.760 --> 2:14:57.760]  And per encode
[2:14:57.760 --> 2:14:59.760]  I don't know how to get into all the technicals for you
[2:14:59.760 --> 2:15:01.760]  The point is, it's clearer than fingerprints
[2:15:01.760 --> 2:15:03.760]  And the CIA thinks it's funny
[2:15:03.760 --> 2:15:05.760]  They get a young Jewish
[2:15:05.760 --> 2:15:07.760]  Massad guy up there
[2:15:07.760 --> 2:15:09.760]  And he wears a turban and says, I will get you America
[2:15:09.760 --> 2:15:11.760]  We're going to kill you
[2:15:11.760 --> 2:15:13.760]  Give up all your rights
[2:15:13.760 --> 2:15:15.760]  I mean, give me a break
[2:15:15.760 --> 2:15:17.760]  I just can't handle it anymore
[2:15:17.760 --> 2:15:19.760]  He's almost laughing when he's talking
[2:15:19.760 --> 2:15:21.760]  It's such a bad actor
[2:15:21.760 --> 2:15:23.760]  But he's doing important work
[2:15:23.760 --> 2:15:25.760]  For the New World Order
[2:15:25.760 --> 2:15:27.760]  Let's talk to
[2:15:27.760 --> 2:15:29.760]  Because remember
[2:15:29.760 --> 2:15:31.760]  This isn't about Muslims
[2:15:31.760 --> 2:15:33.760]  Even if you hate Muslims
[2:15:33.760 --> 2:15:35.760]  The Homeland Security is for gun owners
[2:15:35.760 --> 2:15:37.760]  Conservatives, libertarians
[2:15:37.760 --> 2:15:39.760]  Remember that
[2:15:39.760 --> 2:15:41.760]  We have the official Homeland Security internal documents
[2:15:41.760 --> 2:15:43.760]  It's all about you
[2:15:43.760 --> 2:15:45.760]  You're the slave
[2:15:45.760 --> 2:15:47.760]  You're the property of the bankers
[2:15:47.760 --> 2:15:49.760]  They know they're committing crimes
[2:15:49.760 --> 2:15:51.760]  They know you're going to resist it
[2:15:51.760 --> 2:15:53.760]  So the Pentagon's watching
[2:15:53.760 --> 2:15:55.760]  They're there to make sure the crime continues
[2:15:55.760 --> 2:15:57.760]  It means those running it
[2:15:57.760 --> 2:15:59.760]  Are running it for those aims, period
[2:15:59.760 --> 2:16:01.760]  Our military's been hijacked
[2:16:01.760 --> 2:16:03.760]  Just like when Hitler hijacked the German military
[2:16:05.760 --> 2:16:07.760]  And you better grow up and admit that
[2:16:07.760 --> 2:16:09.760]  But yeah, having the ADL heads
[2:16:09.760 --> 2:16:11.760]  Grandson run around
[2:16:11.760 --> 2:16:13.760]  It's just so rude
[2:16:13.760 --> 2:16:15.760]  And the media never talks about it
[2:16:15.760 --> 2:16:17.760]  But it's admitted if you drill in
[2:16:17.760 --> 2:16:19.760]  I mean, it's a fact
[2:16:19.760 --> 2:16:21.760]  Let's talk to Francis in Canada
[2:16:21.760 --> 2:16:23.760]  Francis here on the air, go ahead
[2:16:23.760 --> 2:16:25.760]  I was wondering if you could
[2:16:25.760 --> 2:16:27.760]  I was wondering if you could help me
[2:16:27.760 --> 2:16:29.760]  Confirm or deny a rumor
[2:16:29.760 --> 2:16:31.760]  I've been looking into about your favorite
[2:16:31.760 --> 2:16:33.760]  Human being George Soros
[2:16:33.760 --> 2:16:35.760]  And what I'm hearing is
[2:16:35.760 --> 2:16:37.760]  Is that early in his career
[2:16:37.760 --> 2:16:39.760]  During World War II
[2:16:39.760 --> 2:16:41.760]  He was pushing
[2:16:41.760 --> 2:16:43.760]  Forged British pounds
[2:16:43.760 --> 2:16:45.760]  For the SS
[2:16:45.760 --> 2:16:47.760]  He was a collaborator
[2:16:47.760 --> 2:16:49.760]  With the SS
[2:16:49.760 --> 2:16:51.760]  And also that he was turning
[2:16:51.760 --> 2:16:53.760]  To the Nazis in exchange for
[2:16:53.760 --> 2:16:55.760]  SS gold
[2:16:55.760 --> 2:16:57.760]  Yeah, that's what Bob Chapman
[2:16:57.760 --> 2:16:59.760]  I need to have him flesh that out
[2:16:59.760 --> 2:17:01.760]  He's not on the next few weeks because of the holidays
[2:17:01.760 --> 2:17:03.760]  But when he gets back
[2:17:03.760 --> 2:17:05.760]  In the first of the year, or he may be on before then
[2:17:05.760 --> 2:17:07.760]  I can ask him to elaborate
[2:17:07.760 --> 2:17:09.760]  I know that Soros
[2:17:09.760 --> 2:17:11.760]  Is a arch criminal
[2:17:11.760 --> 2:17:13.760]  Posing as a liberal
[2:17:13.760 --> 2:17:15.760]  And I know that
[2:17:15.760 --> 2:17:17.760]  Madeleine Albright's dad
[2:17:17.760 --> 2:17:21.760]  Robbed people for the Soviets
[2:17:21.760 --> 2:17:23.760]  In Czechoslovakia
[2:17:23.760 --> 2:17:25.760]  That was a war criminal
[2:17:25.760 --> 2:17:27.760]  And I know that John Shelley Kashvili
[2:17:27.760 --> 2:17:29.760]  Who was the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
[2:17:29.760 --> 2:17:31.760]  I know his dad was the head Nazi in Poland
[2:17:31.760 --> 2:17:33.760]  And so I do know
[2:17:33.760 --> 2:17:35.760]  That huge fortunes were made
[2:17:35.760 --> 2:17:37.760]  By some European Jews
[2:17:37.760 --> 2:17:39.760]  Books have been written on this
[2:17:39.760 --> 2:17:41.760]  Of robbing other Jews and working with the Nazis
[2:17:41.760 --> 2:17:43.760]  And there's been
[2:17:43.760 --> 2:17:45.760]  Actually some books written by
[2:17:45.760 --> 2:17:47.760]  We're going to get him on
[2:17:47.760 --> 2:17:49.760]  He's a Jewish professor in New York City
[2:17:49.760 --> 2:17:51.760]  He went and actually got the documents
[2:17:51.760 --> 2:17:53.760]  Where some Zionist groups
[2:17:53.760 --> 2:17:55.760]  Wouldn't let Jews get out to England or the US
[2:17:55.760 --> 2:17:57.760]  They would make them pay millions to the Zionist groups
[2:17:57.760 --> 2:17:59.760]  And they'd split it with the Nazis
[2:17:59.760 --> 2:18:01.760]  And only let them go to Palestine
[2:18:03.760 --> 2:18:05.760]  And you see that with any
[2:18:05.760 --> 2:18:07.760]  Of these type groups
[2:18:07.760 --> 2:18:09.760]  The leadership of all these hereditary
[2:18:09.760 --> 2:18:11.760]  Or religious groups
[2:18:11.760 --> 2:18:13.760]  Is always feeding on their members
[2:18:13.760 --> 2:18:15.760]  Feeding on them
[2:18:15.760 --> 2:18:17.760]  And it's just, it's horrible
[2:18:17.760 --> 2:18:19.760]  It's just absolutely
[2:18:19.760 --> 2:18:21.760]  Horrible, I mean it makes
[2:18:21.760 --> 2:18:23.760]  Made off in what he did to Jewish groups
[2:18:23.760 --> 2:18:25.760]  Look tame
[2:18:25.760 --> 2:18:27.760]  But
[2:18:27.760 --> 2:18:29.760]  I don't have any proof of that
[2:18:29.760 --> 2:18:31.760]  I haven't fleshed that out, but I
[2:18:31.760 --> 2:18:33.760]  I believe Bob, I mean Bob's
[2:18:33.760 --> 2:18:35.760]  Always pretty accurate here
[2:18:35.760 --> 2:18:37.760]  What do you think?
[2:18:37.760 --> 2:18:39.760]  Apparently the British tried to
[2:18:39.760 --> 2:18:41.760]  Extradite him right after the war
[2:18:41.760 --> 2:18:43.760]  To forge the British bounds
[2:18:43.760 --> 2:18:45.760]  What's your source? I mean I'm asking
[2:18:45.760 --> 2:18:47.760]  You're asking me, I'm asking you
[2:18:47.760 --> 2:18:49.760]  I've been researching this on the internet
[2:18:49.760 --> 2:18:51.760]  And apparently the British tried to
[2:18:51.760 --> 2:18:53.760]  Extradite him from Israel
[2:18:53.760 --> 2:18:55.760]  Around 1948 when it was just created
[2:18:55.760 --> 2:18:57.760]  A young Golda Meir
[2:18:57.760 --> 2:18:59.760]  Who was minister of justice
[2:18:59.760 --> 2:19:01.760]  Denied the British the right to extradite him
[2:19:01.760 --> 2:19:03.760]  You don't want to persecute a real Nazi
[2:19:03.760 --> 2:19:05.760]  If you find one
[2:19:05.760 --> 2:19:07.760]  Only fake ones for the public consumption
[2:19:07.760 --> 2:19:09.760]  Just like with Al Qaeda
[2:19:09.760 --> 2:19:11.760]  I arrest a 14 year old torturer
[2:19:11.760 --> 2:19:13.760]  For eight years and have him confess to crimes
[2:19:13.760 --> 2:19:15.760]  They publicly couldn't have committed
[2:19:15.760 --> 2:19:17.760]  Crimes that were committed after they were incarcerated
[2:19:17.760 --> 2:19:19.760]  But specifically
[2:19:19.760 --> 2:19:21.760]  Did you find that in a mainstream article
[2:19:21.760 --> 2:19:23.760]  Or did you find a document? Because just because
[2:19:23.760 --> 2:19:25.760]  Somebody says something on the internet doesn't mean it's true
[2:19:25.760 --> 2:19:27.760]  Well that's what I was trying to get you to
[2:19:27.760 --> 2:19:29.760]  Yeah I don't know, I'll have to look into that
[2:19:29.760 --> 2:19:31.760]  More, I'll have to look into that more
[2:19:31.760 --> 2:19:33.760]  Next time
[2:19:33.760 --> 2:19:35.760]  Bob's on, we need to
[2:19:35.760 --> 2:19:37.760]  Let's email Bob
[2:19:37.760 --> 2:19:39.760]  To remind him he's not on the next two Fridays
[2:19:39.760 --> 2:19:41.760]  When he's back
[2:19:41.760 --> 2:19:43.760]  We need to make sure
[2:19:43.760 --> 2:19:45.760]  He has an email that we want to talk about that
[2:19:45.760 --> 2:19:47.760]  We want people to know the
[2:19:47.760 --> 2:19:49.760]  The proof in the pudding on that subject
[2:19:49.760 --> 2:19:51.760]  Thank you, caller
[2:19:51.760 --> 2:19:53.760]  Larry, Ash, Paul
[2:19:53.760 --> 2:19:55.760]  I'll take those three calls that I'm getting in the news
[2:19:55.760 --> 2:19:57.760]  And video clips, stay with us
[2:20:01.760 --> 2:20:03.760]  This is an emergency alert
[2:20:03.760 --> 2:20:05.760]  More than half the world's doctors
[2:20:05.760 --> 2:20:07.760]  Are refusing risky vaccinations this fall
[2:20:09.760 --> 2:20:11.760]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz
[2:20:11.760 --> 2:20:13.760]  A Harvard-trained public health expert
[2:20:13.760 --> 2:20:15.760]  Urging you to avoid risky vaccinations
[2:20:15.760 --> 2:20:17.760]  Especially this flu season
[2:20:17.760 --> 2:20:19.760]  Rely on oxysilver instead
[2:20:21.760 --> 2:20:23.760]  Oxysilver's broad spectrum action
[2:20:23.760 --> 2:20:25.760]  Makes all vaccinations and antibiotics
[2:20:25.760 --> 2:20:27.760]  Unnecessary, far safer than colloidal
[2:20:27.760 --> 2:20:29.760]  Silvers, than silver hydrosol
[2:20:29.760 --> 2:20:31.760]  Far safer than colloidal silvers
[2:20:31.760 --> 2:20:33.760]  It works so well
[2:20:33.760 --> 2:20:35.760]  Saving lives and money
[2:20:35.760 --> 2:20:37.760]  Protecting and healing you and your family
[2:20:37.760 --> 2:20:39.760]  It has been targeted for elimination
[2:20:39.760 --> 2:20:41.760]  By the drug cartel
[2:20:41.760 --> 2:20:43.760]  So get it while you still can
[2:20:43.760 --> 2:20:45.760]  Order oxysilver online
[2:20:45.760 --> 2:20:47.760]  At oxysilver.com

[2:20:57.760 --> 2:21:03.760]  This call could save your life
[2:21:03.760 --> 2:21:05.760]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny
[2:21:05.760 --> 2:21:07.760]  In the last century alone
[2:21:07.760 --> 2:21:09.760]  This is our last chance to not relive history
[2:21:09.760 --> 2:21:11.760]  As we're finishing off this agenda
[2:21:11.760 --> 2:21:13.760]  We'll be pulling the rug from underneath
[2:21:13.760 --> 2:21:15.760]  Americans at home
[2:21:15.760 --> 2:21:17.760]  I have turned a tremendous influence
[2:21:17.760 --> 2:21:19.760]  On our president in Congress
[2:21:19.760 --> 2:21:21.760]  And they really are calling the shots
[2:21:21.760 --> 2:21:23.760]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[2:21:23.760 --> 2:21:25.760]  As American citizens to pay attention
[2:21:25.760 --> 2:21:27.760]  Fall of the Republic identifies
[2:21:27.760 --> 2:21:29.760]  The enemies of our nation
[2:21:29.760 --> 2:21:31.760]  The criminal off-short cartel
[2:21:31.760 --> 2:21:33.760]  Hell bent on destroying sovereignty
[2:21:33.760 --> 2:21:35.760]  And on its ashes constructing world government
[2:21:35.760 --> 2:21:37.760]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists
[2:21:37.760 --> 2:21:39.760]  They're asking for more matches
[2:21:39.760 --> 2:21:41.760]  And the Congress is saying
[2:21:41.760 --> 2:21:43.760]  Who do we make the checkout to?
[2:21:43.760 --> 2:21:45.760]  Today seems like nobody does care
[2:21:45.760 --> 2:21:47.760]  And right now in Washington DC
[2:21:47.760 --> 2:21:49.760]  We have seen a fall of the Republic
[2:21:49.760 --> 2:21:51.760]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic
[2:21:51.760 --> 2:21:53.760]  On DVD at infowars.com

[2:22:26.760 --> 2:22:29.760]  Gold has a 5,000-year track record as money
[2:22:29.760 --> 2:22:31.760]  Real money you can count on
[2:22:31.760 --> 2:22:33.760]  No government-backed paper currency comes close
[2:22:33.760 --> 2:22:36.760]  Ask me about the protection of private gold
[2:22:36.760 --> 2:22:38.760]  Call Peter May at

[2:22:42.760 --> 2:22:44.760]  Extension 135
[2:22:44.760 --> 2:22:47.760]  Central banks from around the world are stockpiling gold
[2:22:47.760 --> 2:22:49.760]  They know gold is real money
[2:22:49.760 --> 2:22:50.760]  Call Peter May at
[2:22:50.760 --> 2:22:51.760]  Mitis Resources

[2:22:54.760 --> 2:22:56.760]  Extension 135
[2:22:56.760 --> 2:23:00.760]  To discover the advantages of private protected gold
[2:23:00.760 --> 2:23:03.760]  You have a mortgage and a load of other debt
[2:23:03.760 --> 2:23:05.760]  Wouldn't it be great if it all just went away?
[2:23:05.760 --> 2:23:07.760]  No more mortgage can change your life
[2:23:07.760 --> 2:23:08.760]  We paid off all of our bills
[2:23:08.760 --> 2:23:10.760]  All your debt including your mortgage
[2:23:10.760 --> 2:23:11.760]  In as little as nine years
[2:23:11.760 --> 2:23:12.760]  With no more mortgage
[2:23:12.760 --> 2:23:16.760]  We will have saved over $313,000 in interest payments
[2:23:16.760 --> 2:23:18.760]  Even have more money left over each month
[2:23:18.760 --> 2:23:20.760]  It lowered our monthly payments
[2:23:20.760 --> 2:23:22.760]  By a little over $500
[2:23:22.760 --> 2:23:23.760]  No more mortgage
[2:23:23.760 --> 2:23:25.760]  Where have they been all of our life?
[2:23:25.760 --> 2:23:26.760]  If you knew about something like that
[2:23:26.760 --> 2:23:27.760]  You'd want to tell everybody
[2:23:27.760 --> 2:23:28.760]  Whenever I have a friend
[2:23:28.760 --> 2:23:30.760]  Or someone that needs this service
[2:23:30.760 --> 2:23:31.760]  I give them the number

[2:24:12.760 --> 2:24:15.760]  I wish your buck was still silver
[2:24:15.760 --> 2:24:19.760]  It was back when the country was wrong
[2:24:19.760 --> 2:24:23.760]  We've got a new story up on prisonplanet.com
[2:24:23.760 --> 2:24:26.760]  Chuck Norris says Obama should be impeached
[2:24:26.760 --> 2:24:29.760]  If he tries to enforce Copenhagen Agreement
[2:24:29.760 --> 2:24:31.760]  Actor and political activist warns that globalists
[2:24:31.760 --> 2:24:34.760]  Want to bankrupt America and kill the dollar
[2:24:34.760 --> 2:24:36.760]  It is a high-powered, hardcore interview
[2:24:36.760 --> 2:24:39.760]  With Chuck Norris we did live yesterday
[2:24:39.760 --> 2:24:42.760]  This story can wake up a lot of mainline Republicans
[2:24:42.760 --> 2:24:44.760]  Get it out to everybody
[2:24:44.760 --> 2:24:47.760]  Every mind you unlock is a victory
[2:24:47.760 --> 2:24:49.760]  Remember, none of us have to beat the globalist
[2:24:49.760 --> 2:24:51.760]  Overnight by ourselves
[2:24:51.760 --> 2:24:54.760]  It's all of us doing a little bit every day
[2:24:54.760 --> 2:24:56.760]  Resisting that's going to beat these people
[2:24:56.760 --> 2:24:59.760]  Look at how we're fighting man-made global climate change
[2:24:59.760 --> 2:25:01.760]  Proving it's a fraud
[2:25:01.760 --> 2:25:03.760]  They've gone from arrogantly looking like
[2:25:03.760 --> 2:25:05.760]  They couldn't be stopped to
[2:25:05.760 --> 2:25:10.760]  Blowing up, crashing and burning in front of us
[2:25:10.760 --> 2:25:13.760]  When we get frenzied like a wolf pack
[2:25:13.760 --> 2:25:15.760]  And go after these people on issues
[2:25:15.760 --> 2:25:19.760]  We cannot be beaten
[2:25:19.760 --> 2:25:21.760]  Let's go ahead and talk to Larry in Texas
[2:25:21.760 --> 2:25:23.760]  Larry you're on the air, welcome
[2:25:23.760 --> 2:25:24.760]  Hi Alex
[2:25:24.760 --> 2:25:25.760]  Hey buddy
[2:25:25.760 --> 2:25:27.760]  I'm sorry I've been out of pocket
[2:25:27.760 --> 2:25:28.760]  I don't know if you covered this or not
[2:25:28.760 --> 2:25:31.760]  The latest New London, Connecticut news
[2:25:31.760 --> 2:25:32.760]  About a week ago
[2:25:32.760 --> 2:25:35.760]  Were there stealing everybody's private property?
[2:25:35.760 --> 2:25:38.760]  Well, by a week ago CBS News had a...
[2:25:38.760 --> 2:25:40.760]  They don't even want the property they stole now
[2:25:40.760 --> 2:25:42.760]  Right, Pfizer's side
[2:25:42.760 --> 2:25:46.760]  They're not going to spend a dime on developing it
[2:25:46.760 --> 2:25:48.760]  Yeah, that was in my stack last week
[2:25:48.760 --> 2:25:50.760]  I meant to get to it
[2:25:50.760 --> 2:25:51.760]  It's literally too painful
[2:25:51.760 --> 2:25:53.760]  See, I read this stuff once
[2:25:53.760 --> 2:25:57.760]  And then it's like going and visiting a dead relative's grave
[2:25:57.760 --> 2:25:58.760]  I don't really like doing it
[2:25:58.760 --> 2:26:00.760]  It's like, yeah, they just said
[2:26:00.760 --> 2:26:02.760]  We'll take your property even if we don't use it
[2:26:02.760 --> 2:26:04.760]  We have SWAT teams, they love to murder
[2:26:04.760 --> 2:26:06.760]  Yeah, they interviewed the ex-mayor
[2:26:06.760 --> 2:26:08.760]  He sounded pretty glum
[2:26:08.760 --> 2:26:09.760]  And one of the homeowners
[2:26:09.760 --> 2:26:12.760]  Is standing in the field where his house used to stand
[2:26:12.760 --> 2:26:13.760]  Well, they would do stuff like
[2:26:13.760 --> 2:26:15.760]  The town is so criminal that they would...
[2:26:15.760 --> 2:26:17.760]  This is hundreds of homes, whatever, 300
[2:26:17.760 --> 2:26:18.760]  They would rev
[2:26:18.760 --> 2:26:19.760]  Because we had all the families on
[2:26:19.760 --> 2:26:21.760]  Rev bulldozers at midnight
[2:26:21.760 --> 2:26:22.760]  And threaten them
[2:26:22.760 --> 2:26:25.760]  And then the town got the courts to...
[2:26:25.760 --> 2:26:27.760]  People didn't really read the Supreme Court ruling
[2:26:27.760 --> 2:26:30.760]  The Supreme Court didn't just say
[2:26:30.760 --> 2:26:32.760]  Private interest can have your land
[2:26:32.760 --> 2:26:34.760]  They said, we don't have to pay you
[2:26:34.760 --> 2:26:37.760]  And you can be made to pay lawyer fees
[2:26:37.760 --> 2:26:39.760]  If you don't immediately just give it up
[2:26:39.760 --> 2:26:42.760]  So they come after you, you fight back
[2:26:42.760 --> 2:26:44.760]  You've got to pay lawyer fees
[2:26:44.760 --> 2:26:47.760]  On top of having your half-million-dollar
[2:26:47.760 --> 2:26:50.760]  Three-story Victorian middle-class home
[2:26:50.760 --> 2:26:53.760]  I mean, they've always been persecuting poor people
[2:26:53.760 --> 2:26:56.760]  But, I mean, this was, you know, middle-class area
[2:26:56.760 --> 2:26:58.760]  And they just said, we'll take what we want
[2:26:58.760 --> 2:27:00.760]  And we're not going to pay you
[2:27:00.760 --> 2:27:02.760]  And the Supreme Court ruled that money
[2:27:02.760 --> 2:27:05.760]  Can be given by lobbying groups
[2:27:05.760 --> 2:27:10.760]  Two city councils, county commissioners, state houses
[2:27:10.760 --> 2:27:14.760]  Bribery is now legal to pay to take your land
[2:27:14.760 --> 2:27:17.760]  How do you like that?
[2:27:17.760 --> 2:27:18.760]  Great to be America
[2:27:18.760 --> 2:27:21.760]  Hey, our county here bumps up against Louisiana
[2:27:21.760 --> 2:27:23.760]  And we get the Louisiana News only
[2:27:23.760 --> 2:27:27.760]  And Barxdale Air Force Base
[2:27:27.760 --> 2:27:31.760]  Where that plane landed with Missing Nuke
[2:27:31.760 --> 2:27:33.760]  Two Missing Nukes
[2:27:33.760 --> 2:27:36.760]  Right, the base commander that raised the stink
[2:27:36.760 --> 2:27:38.760]  They ran him off and replaced him
[2:27:38.760 --> 2:27:41.760]  With the commander from North Dakota
[2:27:41.760 --> 2:27:42.760]  That's right
[2:27:42.760 --> 2:27:44.760]  And nine people involved with loading them
[2:27:44.760 --> 2:27:47.760]  Who are witnesses, all committed suicide
[2:27:47.760 --> 2:27:49.760]  Or were murdered
[2:27:49.760 --> 2:27:50.760]  And that was clearly a deal
[2:27:50.760 --> 2:27:52.760]  Where they were trying to switch Nukes out
[2:27:52.760 --> 2:27:54.760]  And claim Al Qaeda got them
[2:27:54.760 --> 2:27:56.760]  But thank God people will the whistle
[2:27:56.760 --> 2:27:58.760]  But next time they'll have the right people in place
[2:27:58.760 --> 2:28:00.760]  To make sure that Nuke goes off in America
[2:28:00.760 --> 2:28:01.760]  One last thing
[2:28:01.760 --> 2:28:03.760]  You think the people
[2:28:03.760 --> 2:28:04.760]  When you tell them the truth
[2:28:04.760 --> 2:28:07.760]  Our fellow citizens, they may not understand it
[2:28:07.760 --> 2:28:10.760]  But if you go to them in a sarcastic way
[2:28:10.760 --> 2:28:14.760]  For instance, to start a chapter
[2:28:14.760 --> 2:28:17.760]  Like the East Texas chapter of Boat Liquors of America
[2:28:17.760 --> 2:28:20.760]  And you know that
[2:28:20.760 --> 2:28:22.760]  Yeah, we worship cameras
[2:28:22.760 --> 2:28:24.760]  We worship force inoculations
[2:28:24.760 --> 2:28:26.760]  We hate due process
[2:28:26.760 --> 2:28:29.760]  And we burn constitutions
[2:28:29.760 --> 2:28:32.760]  If we can do like the ice cream joint
[2:28:32.760 --> 2:28:34.760]  And get 32 flavors of boot polish
[2:28:34.760 --> 2:28:37.760]  You can ask people what's their flavor
[2:28:37.760 --> 2:28:39.760]  That's all I got for you today
[2:28:39.760 --> 2:28:41.760]  That is smart, now that's a smart
[2:28:41.760 --> 2:28:43.760]  Of course it wouldn't really be boot liquors
[2:28:43.760 --> 2:28:46.760]  But make like a fake online ad
[2:28:46.760 --> 2:28:47.760]  Boot liquors of America
[2:28:47.760 --> 2:28:50.760]  And you can have like the 31 flavors
[2:28:50.760 --> 2:28:53.760]  Like take my kids, I love it
[2:28:53.760 --> 2:28:55.760]  Raise my taxes for bankers
[2:28:55.760 --> 2:28:57.760]  I love handing in my guns
[2:28:57.760 --> 2:28:59.760]  Like a slave in Chicago
[2:28:59.760 --> 2:29:01.760]  With the highest crime rate
[2:29:01.760 --> 2:29:02.760]  Poison my water
[2:29:02.760 --> 2:29:04.760]  I love brain damaging my children
[2:29:04.760 --> 2:29:06.760]  And then with a picture of a person
[2:29:06.760 --> 2:29:08.760]  Drinking poison water
[2:29:08.760 --> 2:29:11.760]  Cops running checkpoints
[2:29:11.760 --> 2:29:13.760]  I love killing freedom
[2:29:13.760 --> 2:29:15.760]  I love being a traitor
[2:29:15.760 --> 2:29:18.760]  I love tyranny
[2:29:18.760 --> 2:29:21.760]  Yeah, you come up with 31 flavors pretty easy
[2:29:21.760 --> 2:29:25.760]  Oh God, help me
[2:29:25.760 --> 2:29:27.760]  These are always crazy shows
[2:29:27.760 --> 2:29:29.760]  When I sit here just taking calls
[2:29:34.760 --> 2:29:36.760]  More calls and the video clips in the news
[2:29:36.760 --> 2:29:38.760]  Straight ahead, right here on the one
[2:29:38.760 --> 2:29:40.760]  The only GCN radio network
[2:29:40.760 --> 2:29:43.760]  Please stay with us as we continue to chronicle
[2:29:43.760 --> 2:29:45.760]  The fall of our republic
[2:29:45.760 --> 2:29:47.760]  Into the scientific dictatorship
[2:29:47.760 --> 2:29:49.760]  But that doesn't really matter
[2:29:49.760 --> 2:29:51.760]  The cowboys haven't had a good season
[2:29:51.760 --> 2:29:52.760]  That's what matters
[2:29:52.760 --> 2:29:53.760]  We're on the march
[2:29:53.760 --> 2:29:55.760]  The empire's on the run
[2:29:55.760 --> 2:30:20.760]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[2:30:20.760 --> 2:30:36.760]  The power grid is dangerously overloaded
[2:30:36.760 --> 2:31:01.760]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[2:31:01.760 --> 2:31:04.760]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions
[2:31:04.760 --> 2:31:06.760]  You're going into a battle
[2:31:06.760 --> 2:31:08.760]  And they give you a rifle and a sidearm
[2:31:08.760 --> 2:31:10.760]  How much ammunition do you want?
[2:31:10.760 --> 2:31:12.760]  My answer would be all I can get
[2:31:12.760 --> 2:31:15.760]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones
[2:31:15.760 --> 2:31:17.760]  Food is your only ammunition
[2:31:17.760 --> 2:31:19.760]  How much do you want? When do you want it?
[2:31:19.760 --> 2:31:21.760]  Now or after the battle starts
[2:31:21.760 --> 2:31:22.760]  When will you need it?
[2:31:22.760 --> 2:31:24.760]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[2:31:24.760 --> 2:31:27.760]  Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick?
[2:31:27.760 --> 2:31:29.760]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself
[2:31:29.760 --> 2:31:32.760]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[2:31:32.760 --> 2:31:35.760]  Will you wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply?
[2:31:35.760 --> 2:31:39.760]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life
[2:31:39.760 --> 2:31:41.760]  How much will you need? We don't know
[2:31:41.760 --> 2:31:43.760]  How much do you want? All you can get
[2:31:43.760 --> 2:31:44.760]  I'm Alex Jones
[2:31:44.760 --> 2:31:47.760]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day
[2:31:47.760 --> 2:31:52.760]  Call 1-800-409-5633
[2:31:52.760 --> 2:31:55.760]  Or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com

[2:31:59.760 --> 2:32:02.760]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie
[2:32:02.760 --> 2:32:05.760]  That covers even the food they want you to eat
[2:32:05.760 --> 2:32:07.760]  Will you continue to be their profit center
[2:32:07.760 --> 2:32:09.760]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[2:32:09.760 --> 2:32:11.760]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[2:32:11.760 --> 2:32:13.760]  You don't have to cooperate
[2:32:13.760 --> 2:32:14.760]  There is a solution
[2:32:14.760 --> 2:32:17.760]  Inner health botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love
[2:32:17.760 --> 2:32:20.760]  Have been providing products for the last 5 years

[2:32:34.760 --> 2:32:36.760]  From our friend Mike Adams, the health manager
[2:32:36.760 --> 2:32:38.760]  I love their NutriCafe
[2:32:38.760 --> 2:32:39.760]  Great organic coffee

[2:33:01.760 --> 2:33:06.760]  Music
[2:33:06.760 --> 2:33:12.760]  I read the news today, oh boy
[2:33:12.760 --> 2:33:17.760]  About a lucky man who made the great
[2:33:17.760 --> 2:33:18.760]  Okay
[2:33:20.760 --> 2:33:22.760]  I want to play some video clips
[2:33:22.760 --> 2:33:25.760]  And cover Climate Gay, the latest developments on that right now
[2:33:27.760 --> 2:33:30.760]  We're going to go back to Ash, Paul, Roger and others
[2:33:30.760 --> 2:33:37.760]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231
[2:33:37.760 --> 2:33:41.760]  1-800-259-9231
[2:33:45.760 --> 2:33:48.760]  And the first clip I'm going to be playing in a little while, guys
[2:33:48.760 --> 2:33:50.760]  Is the first time the journalist
[2:33:50.760 --> 2:33:54.760]  Is at the UN conference in Copenhagen Friday
[2:33:54.760 --> 2:33:58.760]  And he simply wants to ask a question
[2:33:58.760 --> 2:34:00.760]  He gets up to the microphone
[2:34:00.760 --> 2:34:03.760]  And they flip out on him and start taking his camera away
[2:34:03.760 --> 2:34:05.760]  And telling other camera people don't tape this
[2:34:05.760 --> 2:34:06.760]  At a press conference
[2:34:06.760 --> 2:34:09.760]  Now Al Gore got questioned by the same reporter
[2:34:09.760 --> 2:34:11.760]  He starts running from him
[2:34:11.760 --> 2:34:14.760]  And the police grab the guy's microphone cable
[2:34:14.760 --> 2:34:15.760]  And unplug it
[2:34:15.760 --> 2:34:17.760]  I mean, the UN
[2:34:17.760 --> 2:34:21.760]  They openly want to shut down free speech worldwide
[2:34:21.760 --> 2:34:24.760]  This is an authoritarian criminal group
[2:34:24.760 --> 2:34:28.760]  I mean, they laud the communist Chinese system
[2:34:28.760 --> 2:34:31.760]  They want you to live under a one-child policy
[2:34:31.760 --> 2:34:34.760]  They want you bankrupt in their own statements
[2:34:34.760 --> 2:34:36.760]  What is it about this?
[2:34:36.760 --> 2:34:38.760]  I'm just so sick of these people
[2:34:38.760 --> 2:34:40.760]  I just want to arrest them
[2:34:40.760 --> 2:34:42.760]  They have committed crimes
[2:34:42.760 --> 2:34:45.760]  They have called to commit bigger conspiracies
[2:34:45.760 --> 2:34:49.760]  Maurice Strong stole billions himself
[2:34:49.760 --> 2:34:52.760]  In the UN food for oil program
[2:34:52.760 --> 2:34:54.760]  And made sure they never got the food
[2:34:54.760 --> 2:34:55.760]  Because he stole the money
[2:34:55.760 --> 2:34:58.760]  I mean, this is a murdering piece of trash
[2:35:01.760 --> 2:35:03.760]  Alright, I'm not going to start ranting
[2:35:03.760 --> 2:35:06.760]  See, the minute I start thinking about these articles
[2:35:06.760 --> 2:35:09.760]  Steam starts coming out of my ears
[2:35:09.760 --> 2:35:13.760]  But I want to comment on Tiger Woods first
[2:35:13.760 --> 2:35:16.760]  When I say we're receiving hundreds of emails
[2:35:16.760 --> 2:35:18.760]  We receive thousands and thousands a day
[2:35:18.760 --> 2:35:20.760]  I'm receiving hundreds
[2:35:20.760 --> 2:35:22.760]  Asking me what I think about Tiger Woods
[2:35:22.760 --> 2:35:25.760]  And so I'll tell you what I think about Tiger Woods
[2:35:25.760 --> 2:35:28.760]  Here in just a moment
[2:35:28.760 --> 2:35:30.760]  First off, I want to thank some of the sponsors
[2:35:30.760 --> 2:35:33.760]  Have made today's radio show possible
[2:35:33.760 --> 2:35:37.760]  And one of them is diginet.net
[2:35:37.760 --> 2:35:41.760]  Personal audio video recorder
[2:35:41.760 --> 2:35:46.760]  Diginet.net
[2:35:46.760 --> 2:35:49.760]  They have a giant list of products
[2:35:49.760 --> 2:35:51.760]  At the lowest prices I've seen them
[2:35:51.760 --> 2:35:53.760]  Because I've bought these systems
[2:35:53.760 --> 2:35:55.760]  Previous to them being a sponsor
[2:35:55.760 --> 2:35:57.760]  They have the Diginet spy glasses
[2:35:57.760 --> 2:36:00.760]  Hidden memory card and camera in the glasses
[2:36:00.760 --> 2:36:02.760]  You can't get any better than this
[2:36:02.760 --> 2:36:04.760]  Now they've got the Diginet pins
[2:36:04.760 --> 2:36:05.760]  They're very affordable
[2:36:05.760 --> 2:36:07.760]  Record audio and video
[2:36:07.760 --> 2:36:08.760]  Diginet.net
[2:36:08.760 --> 2:36:11.760]  That's diginet.net
[2:36:11.760 --> 2:36:12.760]  Do not wait
[2:36:12.760 --> 2:36:15.760]  And they're patriots, ladies and gentlemen
[2:36:15.760 --> 2:36:16.760]  You can also click on their banner
[2:36:16.760 --> 2:36:18.760]  At infowars.com
[2:36:18.760 --> 2:36:22.760]  Oregon, D-I-G-A-N-E-T.net
[2:36:22.760 --> 2:36:25.760]  Diginet.net
[2:36:25.760 --> 2:36:28.760]  Also, I want to tell you about my solar backup
[2:36:28.760 --> 2:36:29.760]  Have you lost your power
[2:36:29.760 --> 2:36:30.760]  And wanted to simply flip a switch
[2:36:30.760 --> 2:36:31.760]  To get the lights back on?
[2:36:31.760 --> 2:36:33.760]  If so, you should check out
[2:36:33.760 --> 2:36:35.760]  Mysolarbackup.com
[2:36:35.760 --> 2:36:37.760]  Because there's never been a better time
[2:36:37.760 --> 2:36:38.760]  To start getting off the grid
[2:36:38.760 --> 2:36:40.760]  And generating your own supply of electrical power
[2:36:40.760 --> 2:36:41.760]  Here's why
[2:36:41.760 --> 2:36:42.760]  Plug-and-play solar generators
[2:36:42.760 --> 2:36:44.760]  Are now available from Solutions from Science
[2:36:44.760 --> 2:36:45.760]  Their portable power systems
[2:36:45.760 --> 2:36:47.760]  Needed no installation
[2:36:47.760 --> 2:36:49.760]  And supply household current
[2:36:49.760 --> 2:36:51.760]  Wherever and whenever you want it
[2:36:51.760 --> 2:36:53.760]  Producing electricity directly from the sun
[2:36:53.760 --> 2:36:55.760]  And it's got batteries too
[2:36:55.760 --> 2:36:56.760]  Unlike gas generators
[2:36:56.760 --> 2:36:57.760]  Solar generators run quietly
[2:36:57.760 --> 2:36:59.760]  And emits no fumes
[2:36:59.760 --> 2:37:00.760]  That's too bad though
[2:37:00.760 --> 2:37:01.760]  We actually need more of that
[2:37:01.760 --> 2:37:03.760]  For the Earth's atmosphere
[2:37:03.760 --> 2:37:06.760]  Continuing, I'm joking
[2:37:06.760 --> 2:37:08.760]  It's like having your own electric power
[2:37:08.760 --> 2:37:10.760]  Plan and is perfect for your home
[2:37:10.760 --> 2:37:11.760]  Or your campsite
[2:37:11.760 --> 2:37:13.760]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms,
[2:37:13.760 --> 2:37:15.760]  Brownouts, or blackouts
[2:37:15.760 --> 2:37:17.760]  You'll never have to suffer through
[2:37:17.760 --> 2:37:19.760]  Painful power outages again
[2:37:19.760 --> 2:37:21.760]  So go to mysolarbackup.com
[2:37:21.760 --> 2:37:24.760]  To request the free information package today
[2:37:24.760 --> 2:37:26.760]  That's mysolarbackup.com
[2:37:26.760 --> 2:37:28.760]  Or 877-327-0365
[2:37:28.760 --> 2:37:31.760]  877-327-0365
[2:37:31.760 --> 2:37:38.760]  Okay, thank you to those sponsors
[2:37:38.760 --> 2:37:44.760]  Alright, there has been a new event
[2:37:44.760 --> 2:37:46.760]  And I've talked to countless reporters
[2:37:46.760 --> 2:37:48.760]  We've played videos of George Soros
[2:37:48.760 --> 2:37:50.760]  Openly-funded groups
[2:37:50.760 --> 2:37:52.760]  Rockefeller-U.N. funded groups
[2:37:52.760 --> 2:37:55.760]  Come to the little climate change skeptics meetings
[2:37:55.760 --> 2:37:56.760]  That aren't funded by BP
[2:37:56.760 --> 2:37:58.760]  And Exxon and Mobile
[2:37:58.760 --> 2:38:01.760]  Dutch World Shell and Amacob
[2:38:01.760 --> 2:38:03.760]  And they just take over the events
[2:38:03.760 --> 2:38:04.760]  They take over the microphones
[2:38:04.760 --> 2:38:06.760]  They yell, they scream
[2:38:06.760 --> 2:38:07.760]  They take over the media
[2:38:07.760 --> 2:38:11.760]  The police never stop them
[2:38:11.760 --> 2:38:13.760]  But the U.N. is just this
[2:38:13.760 --> 2:38:18.760]  Private criminal holding group
[2:38:18.760 --> 2:38:21.760]  And it just does whatever it wants
[2:38:21.760 --> 2:38:28.760]  And so they have IPCC meetings
[2:38:28.760 --> 2:38:35.760]  That are open to the public
[2:38:35.760 --> 2:38:37.760]  Open to accredited media
[2:38:37.760 --> 2:38:39.760]  And then if you happen to ask a question
[2:38:39.760 --> 2:38:40.760]  They don't like, this has come out
[2:38:40.760 --> 2:38:43.760]  Literally scores of times in the news
[2:38:43.760 --> 2:38:45.760]  In the last week and a half
[2:38:45.760 --> 2:38:46.760]  They just come up and shut your mic off
[2:38:46.760 --> 2:38:48.760]  And say you can't ask the question
[2:38:48.760 --> 2:38:50.760]  I mean, why can't you ask about climate change?
[2:38:50.760 --> 2:38:54.760]  Why can't you ask about the emails?
[2:38:54.760 --> 2:38:59.760]  But notice the head of the IPCC's climate division
[2:38:59.760 --> 2:39:01.760]  Says, well, because of the moral standing
[2:39:01.760 --> 2:39:03.760]  Or the political views of the people
[2:39:03.760 --> 2:39:04.760]  That leaked the emails
[2:39:04.760 --> 2:39:05.760]  I'm not going to discuss them
[2:39:05.760 --> 2:39:07.760]  And plus they're private
[2:39:07.760 --> 2:39:08.760]  No, they were ordered to be released
[2:39:08.760 --> 2:39:09.760]  Through FOIA requests
[2:39:09.760 --> 2:39:11.760]  Which they successfully blocked
[2:39:11.760 --> 2:39:13.760]  These are the intergovernmental
[2:39:13.760 --> 2:39:15.760]  And inter-university emails
[2:39:15.760 --> 2:39:17.760]  Where they're fixing the numbers
[2:39:17.760 --> 2:39:18.760]  Hiding the decline
[2:39:18.760 --> 2:39:22.760]  And involved in persecuting other scientists
[2:39:22.760 --> 2:39:25.760]  But notice this big UN thug
[2:39:25.760 --> 2:39:27.760]  This big ninny
[2:39:27.760 --> 2:39:29.760]  Never seen a UN policeman
[2:39:29.760 --> 2:39:31.760]  I mean, they're all this ninny type
[2:39:31.760 --> 2:39:32.760]  They're all like demonic Al Gore's
[2:39:32.760 --> 2:39:34.760]  Man Bear Pigs
[2:39:34.760 --> 2:39:37.760]  And they always
[2:39:37.760 --> 2:39:38.760]  Keep getting emails
[2:39:38.760 --> 2:39:39.760]  What's a Man Bear Pig?
[2:39:39.760 --> 2:39:40.760]  It's a South Park episode
[2:39:40.760 --> 2:39:42.760]  Where he makes up
[2:39:42.760 --> 2:39:43.760]  Been out for two years
[2:39:43.760 --> 2:39:44.760]  Where Al Gore comes to town
[2:39:44.760 --> 2:39:46.760]  To scare everybody to give him money
[2:39:46.760 --> 2:39:48.760]  Shaying there's a creature
[2:39:48.760 --> 2:39:50.760]  That's half man, half bear, and half pig
[2:39:50.760 --> 2:39:52.760]  It's 150%
[2:39:52.760 --> 2:39:53.760]  And it's killing everybody
[2:39:53.760 --> 2:39:54.760]  It's just all made up
[2:39:54.760 --> 2:39:56.760]  The point is, is global warming
[2:39:56.760 --> 2:39:58.760]  Is as real as a Man Bear Pig
[2:39:58.760 --> 2:39:59.760]  Are blood drinking toads
[2:39:59.760 --> 2:40:01.760]  From planet Pop-Tart landing
[2:40:01.760 --> 2:40:02.760]  And sucking your brains out
[2:40:02.760 --> 2:40:04.760]  Through a Curly Cue straw
[2:40:04.760 --> 2:40:06.760]  It isn't real, okay?
[2:40:06.760 --> 2:40:08.760]  Man Bear Pig
[2:40:08.760 --> 2:40:10.760]  But you try to confront Man Bear Pig
[2:40:10.760 --> 2:40:12.760]  Or any of his minions
[2:40:12.760 --> 2:40:13.760]  This is what happens
[2:40:13.760 --> 2:40:14.760]  This is accredited media
[2:40:14.760 --> 2:40:16.760]  At a press conference
[2:40:16.760 --> 2:40:17.760]  Up at the microphone
[2:40:17.760 --> 2:40:18.760]  Here it is
[2:40:18.760 --> 2:40:19.760]  And we'll get to the new clip
[2:40:19.760 --> 2:40:20.760]  Here it is
[2:40:20.760 --> 2:40:21.760]  What do you think of the behavior
[2:40:21.760 --> 2:40:22.760]  Of Professor Phil Jones
[2:40:22.760 --> 2:40:24.760]  In asking colleagues to delete emails
[2:40:24.760 --> 2:40:26.760]  And the destruction of
[2:40:26.760 --> 2:40:28.760]  Of publicly funded data
[2:40:28.760 --> 2:40:31.760]  Which was gathered by public funds?
[2:40:31.760 --> 2:40:33.760]  I don't know what he asked
[2:40:33.760 --> 2:40:34.760]  What he said
[2:40:34.760 --> 2:40:36.760]  But he don't make comments
[2:40:36.760 --> 2:40:39.760]  Bag it up a few seconds
[2:40:39.760 --> 2:40:41.760]  But this woman comes over
[2:40:41.760 --> 2:40:43.760]  And starts grabbing at his microphone
[2:40:43.760 --> 2:40:45.760]  With this very angry look
[2:40:45.760 --> 2:40:46.760]  Like, give me that
[2:40:46.760 --> 2:40:48.760]  I've been told to shut this down
[2:40:48.760 --> 2:40:49.760]  And then he won't give it to her
[2:40:49.760 --> 2:40:50.760]  So she scurries off
[2:40:50.760 --> 2:40:52.760]  And gets the guy with the uniform
[2:40:52.760 --> 2:40:55.760]  Now if you don't think that woman
[2:40:55.760 --> 2:40:57.760]  Won't send police to take
[2:40:57.760 --> 2:40:58.760]  Your second born child
[2:40:58.760 --> 2:41:02.760]  Under the carbon credit tax
[2:41:02.760 --> 2:41:04.760]  Now being proposed
[2:41:04.760 --> 2:41:06.760]  By governments worldwide
[2:41:06.760 --> 2:41:07.760]  And by the IPCC
[2:41:07.760 --> 2:41:09.760]  And the UN
[2:41:09.760 --> 2:41:10.760]  If you don't think the security guard
[2:41:10.760 --> 2:41:11.760]  Won't come in your house
[2:41:11.760 --> 2:41:12.760]  And take your guns
[2:41:12.760 --> 2:41:16.760]  This is like the Pharaoh Ramesses
[2:41:16.760 --> 2:41:18.760]  Demanding all the first born children
[2:41:18.760 --> 2:41:20.760]  Every major culture
[2:41:20.760 --> 2:41:22.760]  From the Aztecs to the Egyptians
[2:41:22.760 --> 2:41:24.760]  To the Babylonians would demand
[2:41:24.760 --> 2:41:26.760]  That people sacrifice their children
[2:41:26.760 --> 2:41:28.760]  And it was always the lower class
[2:41:28.760 --> 2:41:29.760]  The upper class said
[2:41:29.760 --> 2:41:30.760]  There's too many of these people
[2:41:30.760 --> 2:41:32.760]  Kill them
[2:41:32.760 --> 2:41:34.760]  And it's also an act of submission
[2:41:34.760 --> 2:41:37.760]  Give me your child, yes
[2:41:37.760 --> 2:41:39.760]  And 2300 years ago
[2:41:39.760 --> 2:41:41.760]  In the time of Plato
[2:41:41.760 --> 2:41:44.760]  They would have wars with each other
[2:41:44.760 --> 2:41:46.760]  Between the Greek states and right
[2:41:46.760 --> 2:41:48.760]  Letters to each other about
[2:41:48.760 --> 2:41:50.760]  Yes, there's too many of our people
[2:41:50.760 --> 2:41:51.760]  And too many of yours
[2:41:51.760 --> 2:41:52.760]  Let's have a war
[2:41:52.760 --> 2:41:54.760]  And then like a chess game
[2:41:54.760 --> 2:41:56.760]  They would sit back and watch the war
[2:41:56.760 --> 2:41:58.760]  Oh, excellent shot
[2:41:58.760 --> 2:42:00.760]  It's all just entertainment
[2:42:00.760 --> 2:42:01.760]  It's all staged
[2:42:01.760 --> 2:42:03.760]  It was staged 2300 years ago
[2:42:03.760 --> 2:42:05.760]  It's staged now
[2:42:05.760 --> 2:42:07.760]  Just start the clip from the start
[2:42:07.760 --> 2:42:08.760]  Since I interrupted it
[2:42:08.760 --> 2:42:10.760]  But first the info babe comes over
[2:42:10.760 --> 2:42:12.760]  And then the next guy comes over
[2:42:12.760 --> 2:42:14.760]  Go ahead and roll it
[2:42:14.760 --> 2:42:16.760]  What do you think of the behavior
[2:42:16.760 --> 2:42:18.760]  Of Professor Phil Jones in asking
[2:42:18.760 --> 2:42:20.760]  Colleagues to delete emails
[2:42:20.760 --> 2:42:22.760]  And the destruction of public-based
[2:42:22.760 --> 2:42:25.760]  Funded data was gathered by public funds
[2:42:25.760 --> 2:42:27.760]  I don't know what he asked
[2:42:27.760 --> 2:42:28.760]  What he said
[2:42:28.760 --> 2:42:30.760]  I don't make comments
[2:42:30.760 --> 2:42:32.760]  I don't make comments
[2:42:32.760 --> 2:42:34.760]  I don't make comments
[2:42:34.760 --> 2:42:36.760]  I don't make comments
[2:42:36.760 --> 2:42:38.760]  I don't make comments
[2:42:38.760 --> 2:42:40.760]  What he said
[2:42:40.760 --> 2:42:42.760]  And I don't make comments on redacted
[2:42:42.760 --> 2:42:44.760]  E-mails presented to me by people
[2:42:44.760 --> 2:42:46.760]  They're not redacted, liar
[2:42:46.760 --> 2:42:47.760]  Liar
[2:42:47.760 --> 2:42:49.760]  So I cannot get very well commented
[2:42:49.760 --> 2:42:50.760]  What I can say is that
[2:42:50.760 --> 2:42:52.760]  Private communications
[2:42:52.760 --> 2:42:54.760]  That people have between each other
[2:42:54.760 --> 2:42:56.760]  Certainly are not
[2:42:56.760 --> 2:42:57.760]  Public documents
[2:42:57.760 --> 2:42:58.760]  Oh it makes me sick
[2:42:58.760 --> 2:43:00.760]  But the university has D from the honors
[2:43:00.760 --> 2:43:02.760]  That woman's got a brain the size of a walnut
[2:43:02.760 --> 2:43:04.760]  They are not interrupting
[2:43:04.760 --> 2:43:06.760]  Back it up, just đ Aaa back it up
[2:43:06.760 --> 2:43:13.320]  comes over. Now Walnut brain really believes she's saving the world. And then another Walnut brain,
[2:43:13.320 --> 2:43:21.080]  the male security, the male UN police, these are UN police with guns. And an article 29 and 30 of
[2:43:21.080 --> 2:43:26.280]  the UN Charter of Declaration of Human Rights says you have no rights. And the UN everywhere they
[2:43:26.280 --> 2:43:32.120]  go rapes and murders and kills and runs giant child raping rings. I mean, it's mainly a pedophile
[2:43:32.120 --> 2:43:36.760]  guilt. And I mean, you can't make that up. Everywhere they go, they run around snatching
[2:43:36.760 --> 2:43:41.640]  everyone's kids. They're not going to show you the UN roasting a five-year-old over a fire after
[2:43:41.640 --> 2:43:49.240]  they've been raped. That's an America destroyed by design, shows a little boy all bloody and dead,
[2:43:49.880 --> 2:43:55.480]  and the UN smiling with his dead body, or it shows them roasting another little kid to death.
[2:43:56.040 --> 2:44:00.680]  Let me tell you, they want to kill you and your family. Where do you think pedophile killers go?
[2:44:00.680 --> 2:44:07.960]  They go join the UN. Anyways, we don't know, you know, this guy is just a thug who wants
[2:44:07.960 --> 2:44:12.920]  to violate free speech by accredited media. But let's go back to the UN. Here it is.
[2:44:12.920 --> 2:44:18.840]  What I can say is that private communications that people have between each other certainly
[2:44:18.840 --> 2:44:25.320]  are not public documents. But the university has confirmed they are accurate.
[2:44:25.320 --> 2:44:33.560]  They, everybody says privately, well, now let me, I agree, we'll make it short.
[2:44:34.760 --> 2:44:35.320]  Here we go.
[2:44:35.320 --> 2:44:55.880]  I'm going to shut that off for a second, please. If you don't shut that off, I'm going to take
[2:44:55.880 --> 2:44:59.080]  it away from you. Sorry, this is, shall we hear the press? I don't care.
[2:44:59.080 --> 2:45:15.960]  So they kicked them out and wouldn't let them film. Now, that is a UN goon,
[2:45:16.840 --> 2:45:23.640]  obviously from New York, all the way over in another country in Copenhagen, Denmark,
[2:45:23.640 --> 2:45:30.840]  Denmark, with accredited press at a press conference asking their question at their
[2:45:30.840 --> 2:45:36.440]  allotted time. Well, he can't get a question answered there. This fellow is the filmmaker
[2:45:36.440 --> 2:45:42.520]  that made not evil just wrong, which pure evil and wrong should be the name of the,
[2:45:42.520 --> 2:45:48.600]  I mean, Al Gore is a eugenicist. But UN goon, silence journalists who questions Gore on
[2:45:48.600 --> 2:45:53.560]  climate gate and for TV viewers, for radio listeners, I'm going to play the audio. He's
[2:45:53.560 --> 2:45:58.360]  just trying to talk to Al Gore and the security guards go at the microphone and the camera and
[2:45:58.360 --> 2:46:05.000]  rip the cords out. And this has happened to us. Security guards and police are trained go after
[2:46:05.000 --> 2:46:09.720]  the cameras. Hey, they're face scanning cameras on us are great, but our cameras on them, that's
[2:46:09.720 --> 2:46:15.560]  bad because again, we are their property. They don't want a T bone steak at the grocery store
[2:46:15.560 --> 2:46:20.440]  when they walk in to feed on something, jumping off the shelf and hitting them in the face.
[2:46:20.440 --> 2:46:25.000]  You're there to supply them. What is a slave doing with a camera on me?
[2:46:26.520 --> 2:46:30.680]  I think so little of you slave. I'm going to tell you polar bears can't swim and the sun
[2:46:30.680 --> 2:46:36.840]  doesn't cause climate change. I'm going to tell you penguins are drowning because you're idiots.
[2:46:36.840 --> 2:46:42.360]  Now lay there steak and let me cook your butt and eat you. I got men with guns here that say
[2:46:42.360 --> 2:46:47.480]  I rule you. You're going to lay down and you're going to take it. You understand that boy land
[2:46:47.480 --> 2:46:53.400]  of the coward home of the slaves. Lay down and take it. I got potbellied men with weapons
[2:46:54.200 --> 2:47:01.400]  and the force to use them and a cowardly public ready for to be raped. Let's go to Al Gore. Here it is.
[2:47:01.400 --> 2:47:09.560]  Yes. Again, this is the journalist asking Al Gore some inconvenient questions about climate gay.
[2:47:12.920 --> 2:47:16.280]  You've repeatedly said the oldest climate get email is 10 years old.
[2:47:16.280 --> 2:47:18.200]  It's actually two months. Will you correct the record?
[2:47:18.200 --> 2:47:21.480]  Excuse me. We're not doing interviews right now.
[2:47:21.480 --> 2:47:25.800]  It's Mr. Gore. Mr. Gore will be correct. We're not doing interviews right now.
[2:47:25.800 --> 2:47:28.120]  Excuse me. We're not doing interviews right now.
[2:47:30.680 --> 2:47:32.040]  The UN gets the microphone.
[2:47:36.040 --> 2:47:38.760]  UN security pulls the cable from his microphone.
[2:47:38.760 --> 2:47:46.360]  Michael ears. Microphone. And this is what they did to my microphone.
[2:47:47.400 --> 2:47:50.200]  It seems you're not allowed to ask any of the questions of Al Gore.
[2:47:53.640 --> 2:47:55.000]  I really should have gone to this.
[2:47:56.840 --> 2:48:00.280]  I really I need to start just I've got the radio to do.
[2:48:00.280 --> 2:48:03.080]  Can you imagine what would happen if we were in the middle of that circus?
[2:48:03.080 --> 2:48:11.800]  I mean, it would have been. And those UN guys are all really a piece of work.
[2:48:15.560 --> 2:48:20.360]  There's nothing more dangerous than a leftist with a gun because they're not leftists.
[2:48:20.360 --> 2:48:24.920]  These are these are Nazis posing as liberals.
[2:48:24.920 --> 2:48:28.440]  And the sooner you people figure that out, the better off you're going to be
[2:48:28.440 --> 2:48:33.240]  on the subject of other UN information.
[2:48:34.680 --> 2:48:38.600]  Inconvenient truth for Al Gore as his North Pole sums don't add up.
[2:48:39.480 --> 2:48:44.280]  It turns out, remember Al Gore three years ago said that by 2009, the summer,
[2:48:44.280 --> 2:48:48.120]  that the entire Arctic and Antarctic ice caps would be melted.
[2:48:49.400 --> 2:48:53.320]  Unfortunately, they grew by 24% according to NASA.
[2:48:53.320 --> 2:48:57.320]  But see, it doesn't stop Al Gore again yesterday in a press conference,
[2:48:57.320 --> 2:49:01.320]  well, not a press conference, a closed door meeting with only select members of the UN.
[2:49:02.360 --> 2:49:07.720]  A press briefing showing video of the Arctic melting in the summer.
[2:49:09.000 --> 2:49:14.280]  That'd be like if I lived in Wisconsin and I went out and showed my house,
[2:49:14.280 --> 2:49:21.000]  December 15th, covered with snow and said, look, it was once cold.
[2:49:21.000 --> 2:49:27.880]  And then I show them July 4th, 2010 and say, look, now it's green grass.
[2:49:27.880 --> 2:49:29.000]  It's global warming.
[2:49:29.000 --> 2:49:31.160]  Yeah, cause the earth's tilted towards the sun.
[2:49:32.600 --> 2:49:35.640]  We're orbiting a giant nuclear furnace.
[2:49:40.440 --> 2:49:43.320]  But Al Gore three years ago said it would be completely melted.
[2:49:43.320 --> 2:49:44.360]  It's actually gotten bigger.
[2:49:46.680 --> 2:49:49.400]  Bigger than it was three years ago because not only does it get bigger
[2:49:49.400 --> 2:49:52.600]  in the winter, smaller in the summer, there's cycles.
[2:49:52.600 --> 2:49:55.720]  And this has all been recorded by Arctic expeditions.
[2:49:56.840 --> 2:50:03.320]  You know, one year in Arctic Explorer goes up and then it gets cold and traps in 200 miles in.
[2:50:04.040 --> 2:50:09.880]  And they say, oh, the last expedition 10 years ago, this didn't happen because it fluctuates.
[2:50:10.440 --> 2:50:13.880]  I mean, it's even more astanine to say that polar bears can't swim.
[2:50:13.880 --> 2:50:23.240]  But worse than that is to say that climate change is abnormal.
[2:50:23.240 --> 2:50:26.840]  Think how dumb they think you are climate change.
[2:50:29.880 --> 2:50:34.680]  Change climate change.
[2:50:37.000 --> 2:50:42.440]  There were times in British history where every year major rivers froze.
[2:50:42.440 --> 2:50:44.040]  Now it hasn't happened in a century.
[2:50:45.160 --> 2:50:49.320]  But there were times before that when it didn't freeze at all either.
[2:50:49.320 --> 2:50:50.920]  They have records of all of this.
[2:50:50.920 --> 2:50:52.360]  It fluctuates.
[2:50:53.880 --> 2:50:57.560]  But again, they tell your school kids that penguins can't swim and are grounding.
[2:50:57.560 --> 2:50:59.080]  That's what you let them do.
[2:50:59.080 --> 2:51:01.240]  These criminals, they know what they're doing.
[2:51:02.280 --> 2:51:06.760]  We all know that the Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name of water filtration.
[2:51:06.760 --> 2:51:11.160]  As an authorized Berkey dealer for over four years and serving thousands of satisfied customers,

[2:52:02.920 --> 2:52:07.000]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[2:52:07.000 --> 2:52:10.200]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[2:52:10.200 --> 2:52:15.480]  As we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[2:52:15.480 --> 2:52:21.400]  I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots.
[2:52:21.400 --> 2:52:26.680]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[2:52:26.680 --> 2:52:32.120]  For the republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel,
[2:52:32.120 --> 2:52:36.760]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[2:52:36.760 --> 2:52:39.080]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[2:52:39.080 --> 2:52:43.160]  They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[2:52:43.160 --> 2:52:45.240]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[2:52:45.240 --> 2:52:50.440]  And right now in Washington DC, we have seen a fall of the republic.

[2:53:01.880 --> 2:53:03.960]  Men, are you urinating more frequently?
[2:53:04.520 --> 2:53:06.360]  Do you wake up to urinate?
[2:53:06.360 --> 2:53:08.120]  Don't ignore your prostate health.

[2:53:12.120 --> 2:53:16.600]  Beta prostate is a natural supplement that helps your body support prostate health.

[2:53:21.640 --> 2:53:27.080]  Beta prostate has plant sterols shown to support healthy urine flow and healthy sleeping habits.
[2:53:27.080 --> 2:53:29.480]  And beta prostate is so powerful.
[2:53:29.480 --> 2:53:35.320]  You'd have to take 100 sawpaw metal capsules to get the same plant sterols found in one beta
[2:53:35.320 --> 2:53:39.160]  prostate. New customers can get a free bottle of beta prostate.

[2:54:29.240 --> 2:54:37.240]  So Al Gore came out again and said, look, five to seven years, there's not going to be any ice caps.
[2:54:39.960 --> 2:54:45.560]  And then the actual scientist that he quotes came out and said, well, that's not actually
[2:54:45.560 --> 2:54:48.600]  right. I'm saying it could potentially maybe happen.
[2:54:48.600 --> 2:54:52.120]  But certainly not a 75% chance like Al Gore says.
[2:54:52.120 --> 2:54:56.440]  I mean, these guys said we were going to all freeze to death in 1974.
[2:54:56.440 --> 2:55:03.240]  And then we had to build and pay global taxes to build giant carbon dioxide factories to terraform the earth.
[2:55:06.760 --> 2:55:09.320]  I mean, they just keep making up lie after lie.
[2:55:09.320 --> 2:55:13.720]  But notice every lie positions them as the saviors of the earth.
[2:55:14.280 --> 2:55:16.360]  They will save you.
[2:55:16.360 --> 2:55:17.880]  Just pay them the tax money.
[2:55:17.880 --> 2:55:28.040]  The good news is we had a big guest on yesterday who's a high powered lawyer, works with Congress.
[2:55:29.560 --> 2:55:34.120]  And he did break the news here that he's already started litigation, but he didn't want to give details.
[2:55:35.480 --> 2:55:39.160]  And I don't know if this is that litigation, but there's a lot of litigation
[2:55:39.160 --> 2:55:44.840]  against these different universities and government bodies in the emails, openly engaged in fraud.
[2:55:44.840 --> 2:55:48.600]  The British have been caught destroying the evidence now, but they said, don't worry.
[2:55:48.600 --> 2:55:53.160]  We have the value added integrated data that we made up.
[2:55:55.480 --> 2:55:57.720]  They immediately destroyed the data.
[2:55:57.720 --> 2:56:01.000]  What does that tell you when somebody destroys the data when they get caught?
[2:56:03.000 --> 2:56:06.360]  It's like the police come in your house and you're like flushing cocaine down the toilet.
[2:56:06.360 --> 2:56:10.440]  I mean, it's or let's say you've been killing little kids.
[2:56:10.440 --> 2:56:14.760]  You're like throwing their body parts in a furnace as the cops come in pouring gasoline on it.
[2:56:14.760 --> 2:56:17.240]  I mean, just caught red handed.
[2:56:18.600 --> 2:56:20.600]  It's even worse trying to destroy the evidence.
[2:56:21.560 --> 2:56:27.400]  So now the department of energies had to send a litigation hold notice regarding
[2:56:27.400 --> 2:56:33.240]  CRU to employees asking to preserve documents saying, do not shred documents.
[2:56:34.440 --> 2:56:39.320]  The department of energy has received a litigation hold notice from the US department
[2:56:39.320 --> 2:56:43.080]  of energy general counsel and the DOE office of inspector general.
[2:56:43.800 --> 2:56:48.600]  And this is due to lawsuits being filed and congressional request regarding the climate
[2:56:48.600 --> 2:56:50.840]  research unit at the university of East Anglia in England.
[2:56:51.560 --> 2:56:57.720]  Accordingly, they are requesting that SR in SS SRRs is happening in the US to not just England
[2:56:57.720 --> 2:57:03.080]  and other site contractors locate, preserve all documents, records, data, correspondence notes
[2:57:03.080 --> 2:57:08.120]  and other materials, whether official or unofficial, original or duplicative, duplicative,
[2:57:08.120 --> 2:57:15.080]  drafts or final versions, partial or complete related to global warming.
[2:57:16.920 --> 2:57:23.320]  And this includes PDFs, PDAs, palm pilots, blackberries, computers, telephone logs,
[2:57:23.320 --> 2:57:28.040]  internet usage files, emails, system manuals, network access information.
[2:57:28.040 --> 2:57:29.320]  It goes on and on folks.
[2:57:32.440 --> 2:57:36.920]  It looks like they're not going to get Copenhagen, but they're going to try to do it by stealth.
[2:57:36.920 --> 2:57:40.360]  As Lord Monty and others have said, I want to break that down and we come back.
[2:57:40.360 --> 2:57:42.200]  But this is better than we thought.
[2:57:43.240 --> 2:57:46.840]  Because if there's no tentative agreement, Obama has nothing to sign.
[2:57:47.400 --> 2:57:52.680]  So what they'll do is they're going to sign an agreement to agree to meet Mexico City next year,
[2:57:52.680 --> 2:57:54.440]  like our expert guest said yesterday.
[2:57:54.440 --> 2:57:55.720]  And that's now come out today.
[2:57:56.440 --> 2:58:02.600]  And he is still going to instruct the EPA to say that carbon dioxide is a deadly poison.
[2:58:02.600 --> 2:58:07.000]  And they're going to go ahead and implement the tax. We've got to fight it.
[2:58:07.000 --> 2:58:09.560]  We've got to make the Senate and the House do their job.
[2:58:09.560 --> 2:58:10.920]  The states have to say no.
[2:58:12.200 --> 2:58:16.520]  If we'll just get up off our butts, I mean, if a bully comes over and starts punching us
[2:58:16.520 --> 2:58:18.120]  and we lay there, we know he's going to win.
[2:58:19.080 --> 2:58:23.000]  But if we just attack the bully, if he's bigger than us in the Info War,
[2:58:23.720 --> 2:58:27.160]  pick up a rock slamming upside their head, I mean, that figuratively,
[2:58:27.720 --> 2:58:30.520]  I mean, you know, do whatever you got to pick up a stick.
[2:58:30.520 --> 2:58:34.520]  I mean, we got the Info War. Let's get nasty with these people.
[2:58:34.520 --> 2:58:36.920]  Let's take them on. Let's discredit these criminals.
[2:58:36.920 --> 2:59:02.360]  They're scumbag degenerate filth that will be defeated. Period.
[2:59:07.320 --> 2:59:08.680]  You'll know what's in your cup.
[2:59:08.680 --> 2:59:11.240]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.

[3:00:07.800 --> 3:00:12.440]  All right, here's the deal. I want to continue with phone calls, and then I want to get into
[3:00:13.080 --> 3:00:17.000]  internet censorship in the United States, Canada, England, Australia.
[3:00:17.000 --> 3:00:20.360]  The Western world has started to outnude China. I mean, it's really happening.
[3:00:21.400 --> 3:00:24.920]  I want to get into some economic news. There's a bunch of stuff I haven't gotten to.
[3:00:24.920 --> 3:00:29.160]  I have some other video clips I want to play, but I want to continue taking your calls.
[3:00:29.160 --> 3:00:41.720]  Ash, Paul, Roger, Adam, Burn, Joe, and others, toll-free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[3:00:41.720 --> 3:00:47.880]  But finishing up with Climategate, we do have the initiative. They are on the run.
[3:00:48.440 --> 3:00:52.760]  They've been caught in fraud over and over and over and over again.
[3:00:52.760 --> 3:00:56.760]  And they always just say, there's a consensus. No one disagrees.
[3:00:56.760 --> 3:01:04.280]  And just move on. But now the fact that they're lying on purpose has been exposed.
[3:01:04.840 --> 3:01:09.160]  The third world got the leaked text last week. I told you that was a big deal.
[3:01:11.240 --> 3:01:16.840]  I mean, it's like jumping in front of a train is a big deal. I mean, I'm not that smart.
[3:01:17.400 --> 3:01:23.320]  When they keep the treaty secret, they plan to keep it secret until Thursday
[3:01:23.320 --> 3:01:27.800]  so they can ram it through with Obama there. I mean, imagine how these governments operate.
[3:01:27.800 --> 3:01:33.960]  Oh, the treaty secret. We can't let you see it. And then they leak it and it says the third world
[3:01:33.960 --> 3:01:38.360]  has to make right at double the cuts. It's meant to shut them off so the IMF and World Bank can
[3:01:38.360 --> 3:01:42.120]  take over and totally control them. They'll have a banking dictatorship. The U.M. will
[3:01:42.120 --> 3:01:49.160]  have no power. Private banks will rule the planet. I mean, it's just so openly certified
[3:01:49.160 --> 3:01:59.160]  corruption, certified tyranny. And of course, the third world was suckered and told, oh yeah,
[3:01:59.160 --> 3:02:03.720]  you're going to get all of America's money. You're going to get all of Europe and Japan's money.
[3:02:04.440 --> 3:02:08.120]  Yes, the same IMF and World Bank that have always been robbing you blind,
[3:02:09.320 --> 3:02:14.360]  they're going to suddenly give you all this money because George Soros promises because he's a nice
[3:02:14.360 --> 3:02:23.080]  man. And these gullible fools all paid off by Soros and the UN, I guess they weren't fools,
[3:02:23.080 --> 3:02:25.640]  showed up thinking they were about to get a bunch of money and they were told,
[3:02:25.640 --> 3:02:30.440]  actually, we're going to kill most of the people in your country. 15 million starved death every
[3:02:30.440 --> 3:02:38.840]  year. Just our ethanol scam taking the food production for gasoline. That made 10 million
[3:02:38.840 --> 3:02:44.200]  more starved to death. This will be a hundred fold that how's that sound? And the people are like,
[3:02:45.000 --> 3:02:51.000]  even though you bought us off, you want to kill most of our people? Yes, we do and have a one
[3:02:51.000 --> 3:02:56.920]  child policy. How does that sound? Well, gee, already most of our people know you spiked the
[3:02:56.920 --> 3:03:02.200]  vaccines and kill them. We're going to get overthrown if we try this. And they literally,
[3:03:02.200 --> 3:03:07.160]  the Africans were crying on TV over it and our media would spin it and go, the Africans want
[3:03:07.160 --> 3:03:12.840]  America to make bigger cuts because, because America flooded the ocean and made Africa flood.
[3:03:12.840 --> 3:03:17.080]  I mean, literally, they're on the news saying Africa's flooding. I mean, I mean, it's just
[3:03:17.720 --> 3:03:23.160]  the UN's own report says we've had the least amount of natural disasters per capita the last decade.
[3:03:25.560 --> 3:03:28.680]  Well, where is that Reuters article? I've got it here in the stack. Let me give you the exact
[3:03:28.680 --> 3:03:38.520]  headline. Forget the exact number. It's big oil behind climate scan matter. I'll find it. Hey,
[3:03:38.520 --> 3:03:46.600]  you guys, I printed off that article about the UN. Oh, it doesn't matter about the UN says
[3:03:47.800 --> 3:03:54.360]  the last decade's one of the least violent. I'll find it to men in African states in climate
[3:03:54.360 --> 3:04:00.360]  talks boycott deadlock threatened Copenhagen climate deal. That's back today climate treaty.
[3:04:00.360 --> 3:04:04.440]  We create new global agencies to transfer money and technology from US and other developed
[3:04:04.440 --> 3:04:08.760]  countries. The third world you mean to the IMF and World Bank gore polar ice may vanish.
[3:04:10.200 --> 3:04:16.280]  Here it is natural disasters at decade low. There you go in 2009 UN report Reuters.
[3:04:16.280 --> 3:04:24.920]  So it's a decade low this year and some of that other news. But the point here is
[3:04:27.640 --> 3:04:31.640]  is that they are in big trouble, but they're not going to stop. These are criminals.
[3:04:31.640 --> 3:04:37.160]  They want to run your life and they are brainwashing your kids. They run your local schools. They run
[3:04:37.160 --> 3:04:40.600]  everything. You've got to go to your city councils, go to your school boards and say,
[3:04:40.600 --> 3:04:47.000]  stop teaching this fraud. Stop teaching my kid your one child policy. Stop your brainwashing.
[3:04:48.040 --> 3:04:53.640]  You degenerate control freaks get out of my life. You parasites. We're going to come back,
[3:04:53.640 --> 3:04:57.800]  take a bunch of calls, get into the big push now, not just for government run healthcare,
[3:04:58.360 --> 3:05:02.840]  which looks like it may pass, but for a bunch of new taxes. This is Alex Jones with five good
[3:05:02.840 --> 3:05:07.800]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation
[3:05:07.800 --> 3:05:12.920]  could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energies are wants to control
[3:05:12.920 --> 3:05:17.880]  how much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of
[3:05:17.880 --> 3:05:23.160]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the
[3:05:23.160 --> 3:05:28.520]  country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now new socialist legislation is only
[3:05:28.520 --> 3:05:33.240]  compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[3:05:33.240 --> 3:05:37.720]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages. Number five,
[3:05:37.720 --> 3:05:42.120]  a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks,
[3:05:42.120 --> 3:05:45.960]  I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science. One of my
[3:05:45.960 --> 3:05:52.920]  oldest sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.

[3:06:00.600 --> 3:06:06.840]  Hi, folks. This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[3:06:06.840 --> 3:06:11.800]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into
[3:06:11.800 --> 3:06:17.240]  the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs. The respiratory system is the first
[3:06:17.240 --> 3:06:22.440]  line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses. The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the
[3:06:22.440 --> 3:06:28.280]  respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the
[3:06:28.280 --> 3:06:34.120]  silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream. With continued legislation threatening the sale
[3:06:34.120 --> 3:06:40.360]  of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs
[3:06:40.360 --> 3:06:45.480]  Generator. Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production
[3:06:45.480 --> 3:06:52.600]  fast and simple. Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology
[3:06:52.600 --> 3:06:59.720]  of the Silver Lungs Generator. That's www.silverlungs.com.
[3:07:02.040 --> 3:07:08.120]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance to not
[3:07:08.120 --> 3:07:13.240]  relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath
[3:07:13.240 --> 3:07:19.400]  Americans at home. I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are
[3:07:19.400 --> 3:07:25.720]  calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[3:07:25.720 --> 3:07:31.160]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation. The criminal offshore cartel
[3:07:31.160 --> 3:07:35.720]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[3:07:35.720 --> 3:07:40.920]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and Arsonists, they're asking for more matches. And the Congress is saying,
[3:07:40.920 --> 3:07:45.560]  who do we make the checkout to? Today seems like nobody does care. And right now in Washington,
[3:07:45.560 --> 3:07:52.600]  D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD
[3:07:52.600 --> 3:07:59.400]  at infowars.com. We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:08:03.000 --> 3:08:09.560]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the Information War continues.
[3:08:09.560 --> 3:08:18.600]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network. All right, let's blast through your phone
[3:08:18.600 --> 3:08:24.360]  calls right now, and I'm going to get into more of what's developing across our planet
[3:08:25.480 --> 3:08:31.480]  as we desperately fight the private global corporate takeover known as the New World Order.
[3:08:31.480 --> 3:08:36.840]  Oh, before I do that, I am famous for saying I'm going to cover something and then not doing it.
[3:08:36.840 --> 3:08:41.880]  I know because I move off to something else, but I said I would talk about Tiger Woods.
[3:08:43.880 --> 3:08:45.880]  So let me just talk about Tiger Woods right now.
[3:08:47.800 --> 3:08:53.880]  Two, three weeks ago when he first had the wreck, everybody called me wanting me to talk about it.
[3:08:55.880 --> 3:08:59.560]  Why should I care if somebody at one o'clock in the morning
[3:08:59.560 --> 3:09:07.800]  has a wreck by their house and if their wife was attacking him, that's par for the course.
[3:09:07.800 --> 3:09:12.600]  I mean, welcome to decadent America. They're worth a billion bucks and they're not happy.
[3:09:14.040 --> 3:09:19.480]  And, you know, if it comes out that Tiger Woods is running giant child kidnapping rings with
[3:09:19.480 --> 3:09:29.880]  Dincor and Halliburton, then I'll become concerned. I mean, yes, he liked racy women and he liked a
[3:09:29.880 --> 3:09:34.520]  lot of them. And what he did, I'm sure isn't good for his wife and children and it's not good.
[3:09:35.800 --> 3:09:43.800]  But compared to Halliburton and Dincor on congressional record running giant child
[3:09:43.800 --> 3:09:50.840]  kidnapping rings on record, Chicago Tribune, Associated Press,
[3:09:54.440 --> 3:10:00.360]  big UN groups caught in Asia, in Africa, in Latin America, in Eastern Europe,
[3:10:00.360 --> 3:10:06.120]  in Central Europe, running giant sex slave rings, kidnapping children
[3:10:07.640 --> 3:10:10.440]  using UN aircraft to fly them out all over the world.
[3:10:10.440 --> 3:10:17.480]  But, see, no, we can't talk about that. We've got to talk about Tiger Woods with 30-year-old
[3:10:17.480 --> 3:10:26.200]  hookers. We can't talk about offshore banks that have stolen over $23 trillion in the last year
[3:10:26.200 --> 3:10:31.480]  from us. We can't talk about how they're setting up a value-added tax and national federally
[3:10:31.480 --> 3:10:36.360]  administered sales tax to track everything we buy, sell, and do with new bureaucracies and
[3:10:36.360 --> 3:10:44.760]  new taxing authorities that'll make the IRS look like choir boys. No. We can't talk about
[3:10:45.400 --> 3:10:50.840]  what's really in the Copenhagen Treaty, open world government, or how Obama's declaring himself an
[3:10:50.840 --> 3:10:59.560]  emperor, a dictator, saying if Congress won't pass the sign over a power to the UN, he'll just implement it.
[3:10:59.560 --> 3:11:09.400]  We can't talk about how Rand Corporation's done a report calling for the new homeland
[3:11:09.400 --> 3:11:16.440]  security divisions, the 379,000 troops, to augment all local police departments and that
[3:11:16.440 --> 3:11:22.760]  local police will form auxiliaries of the new national police force run by the Pentagon.
[3:11:22.760 --> 3:11:30.840]  I've read all 130-plus pages in the 50-something page addendum. I suggest you go read. Let me
[3:11:30.840 --> 3:11:40.440]  close shot of this, please, gentlemen. A stability police force for the United States,
[3:11:40.440 --> 3:11:47.000]  justification and options for creating U.S. capabilities. I mean, this is a death squad manual.
[3:11:47.000 --> 3:11:52.040]  It's got the force
[3:11:55.000 --> 3:11:59.160]  setups for the federal police. And by the way, this has already been set up. They're just now
[3:11:59.160 --> 3:12:05.800]  announcing it. Here's a medium stability police force unit.
[3:12:08.600 --> 3:12:14.040]  Here's a small stability police force. This is the federal officer that's over your small town.
[3:12:14.040 --> 3:12:18.360]  You've got a small town of 500 people. Well, this is the group that's going to run your life.
[3:12:19.080 --> 3:12:23.720]  They're going to run carbon taxes. They got special forces operatives getting in place
[3:12:23.720 --> 3:12:28.520]  in the paper in Austin. Black ops run this. I mean, these people are going to, you are going
[3:12:28.520 --> 3:12:35.560]  to be slaves, folks, and they mean business. Here's another one, medium stability police force.
[3:12:35.560 --> 3:12:44.440]  Ooh, look at that. This is for a bigger city. This is the federal police commander over your
[3:12:44.440 --> 3:12:54.840]  police department. Pentagon openly taking over your police departments. I mean, that is worse
[3:12:54.840 --> 3:13:07.640]  than red China. Red China doesn't even allow that. What do you think they're being set up for?
[3:13:07.640 --> 3:13:11.880]  It happens everywhere. When this is set up, they're going to take your farms and ranches.
[3:13:11.880 --> 3:13:15.320]  They're going to take your children. They're going to take everything you got. And they always do
[3:13:15.320 --> 3:13:19.720]  it by, well, you got this environmental fee on your property. You can't pay it, Bob.
[3:13:19.720 --> 3:13:26.200]  And most people, all right, I'll give you the property and all right, all right. But if you
[3:13:26.200 --> 3:13:29.560]  hold up, they're just going to call up the police force and they're going to come by and murder
[3:13:29.560 --> 3:13:35.320]  your butt. You pay for the military. They're there to attack the enemy. And that enemy's you.
[3:13:35.320 --> 3:13:39.640]  You read the MIAC report. You read the Homeland Security report. I got those reports since the
[3:13:39.640 --> 3:13:43.880]  late nineties and nobody listened to me. Now when I cover them, they get national attention.
[3:13:43.880 --> 3:13:54.520]  Your military in your military. I've talked to so much family in the army. I got a lot of family
[3:13:54.520 --> 3:13:58.280]  in the army and I talked to other people and they're all mad. I mean, I know people that are in
[3:13:58.280 --> 3:14:03.640]  supply and logistics and people that are in over repair and they're all been training for three
[3:14:03.640 --> 3:14:09.480]  years for riot control domestically. Long before they dropped the hammer on the banking situation,
[3:14:09.480 --> 3:14:15.640]  and it's been reported by Bloomberg and Scripps Howard News Service that it was all staged,
[3:14:15.640 --> 3:14:21.240]  all designed, and they're going to keep killing the economy and they're going to stage riots and
[3:14:21.240 --> 3:14:26.120]  you're going to beg to have the army on the streets and they'll restore order and then they'll never
[3:14:26.120 --> 3:14:31.880]  leave. And it'll just be where'd Bob go and Bob wouldn't give it to leave his house. They sent
[3:14:31.880 --> 3:14:37.800]  a robot in and killed him. Shh. Don't don't let and they'll be like a 12 year old walking by
[3:14:37.800 --> 3:14:42.680]  with their armband, literally giving them armbands with the explorer scouts now. They'll be like,
[3:14:43.640 --> 3:14:50.600]  that's already happening. Adults are already just, oh man, the worst part is going to be the
[3:14:50.600 --> 3:14:55.560]  12, 13, 14 year old punks on power trips. I mean, it's going to be really hard getting
[3:14:55.560 --> 3:15:03.720]  bossed around by them. But that's what America is. We are the ultimate rotten cow being fed on
[3:15:03.720 --> 3:15:13.160]  by carrion being fed on by carrion turkeys. Do they call the buzzards around here, turkey buzzard?
[3:15:15.880 --> 3:15:19.960]  I just can't believe our country's this easy to rob. I mean, I mean, this is a completely
[3:15:19.960 --> 3:15:26.200]  criminal, illegal, unconstitutional operation has nothing to do with the stupid al-Qaeda boogie man
[3:15:26.200 --> 3:15:35.080]  you were all taught to fear. It's for you and your guns in your house by a bunch of criminals.
[3:15:37.080 --> 3:15:43.160]  We really are a nation of just cowards. The cops are going to go along, the military is going to
[3:15:43.160 --> 3:15:48.040]  go along, the general public is going to go along. Obama will get a bunch of it set up,
[3:15:48.040 --> 3:15:52.680]  then a Republican will come in, he'll continue it. Suddenly Republicans will love the police state.
[3:15:52.680 --> 3:15:58.120]  Democrats didn't like war. Now they love it. War is peace. Oh, give him a peace prize.
[3:16:06.520 --> 3:16:13.320]  We have to admit how pathetic we are. You know, every few years I get to pigging out and drinking
[3:16:13.320 --> 3:16:17.720]  whiskey and smoking cigarettes. And I've got to finally admit to myself after a month or two
[3:16:17.720 --> 3:16:22.360]  of it, when I gained 20 pounds doing it, that this may feel good, buddy, but you got to stop it.
[3:16:23.960 --> 3:16:29.800]  You can't go eat big rib eye steaks and drink. I have, you know, a bottle of whiskey. The point is,
[3:16:29.800 --> 3:16:34.600]  and I've got to realize it's bad and not do it. And I fall back sometimes, but I quit.
[3:16:35.800 --> 3:16:39.880]  I've gone five, six years before without drinking or smoking or eating like a pig.
[3:16:39.880 --> 3:16:43.880]  But the point is, is that when I start working too much, it's a crutch I fall back on. It's a
[3:16:43.880 --> 3:16:48.440]  big anxiety relief. You can be worried about the world and worried about what you're doing and
[3:16:49.240 --> 3:16:53.880]  go in and drink a couple of beers, need a big steak. You're not worried about it anymore.
[3:16:55.080 --> 3:17:00.120]  I'm pretty pathetic. And when I start getting pathetic, I've got to admit I'm pathetic. You
[3:17:00.120 --> 3:17:05.960]  as a country have to do that too, folks. I mean, we have to admit we are a steaming pile of horse poo.
[3:17:06.760 --> 3:17:12.760]  I mean, we really are a joke. By the way, I've been corrected for a decade. I've been saying
[3:17:12.760 --> 3:17:18.840]  50 million abortions. Of course it's 60 million now that we pull up number of abortions in US
[3:17:18.840 --> 3:17:25.080]  latest numbers. I think it's 60 mil, but I want to be precise about that. I mean, look, if we're
[3:17:25.080 --> 3:17:33.560]  so lazy that we kill our own babies, I mean, even if you're for birth control, don't be lazy,
[3:17:33.560 --> 3:17:39.480]  get regular birth control. Don't go in and have dangerous procedures for yourself and kill a kid
[3:17:39.480 --> 3:17:44.840]  because you were too lazy. And now you don't want to raise the kid because television told you kids
[3:17:44.840 --> 3:17:50.680]  are horrible when you're not living until you got children. Heaven sounds like living on some
[3:17:50.680 --> 3:17:59.080]  deserted jungle tropical island of like 50 of children. Let me tell you, all you stupid yuppies
[3:17:59.080 --> 3:18:03.720]  and all you, you people that never had kids, you think you're all selfish and your life's all about
[3:18:03.720 --> 3:18:09.000]  you. You're not happy or you may think you're happy. You don't know how good it is having children.
[3:18:09.640 --> 3:18:14.120]  You don't know how magic they are and how much you understand about humanity once you have them.
[3:18:18.920 --> 3:18:25.080]  And sure, in modern society, they're a pain in the butt and they get programmed by the society to
[3:18:25.080 --> 3:18:33.960]  act up and they're rebellious. They're little people, but that's part of life. You're meant to be part
[3:18:33.960 --> 3:18:44.760]  of the life cycle. It's like you see butterflies mating. I mean, you're meant to live on this planet,
[3:18:45.640 --> 3:18:51.240]  hurtling through space. You're meant to have children. You're meant to love and struggle
[3:18:51.240 --> 3:18:57.080]  and have a life and you've been taught that death is good and life is bad.
[3:19:00.360 --> 3:19:07.160]  And so now they think you're so weak-minded, so shallow, so open to suggestion that they can
[3:19:07.160 --> 3:19:11.800]  write articles in Newsweek and Time magazine saying, let's just kill old people. Hey, yuppies,
[3:19:11.800 --> 3:19:16.360]  you'll have more money if we start whacking grandma. And the yuppies are like, hell yeah, kill old
[3:19:16.360 --> 3:19:22.040]  people. Their life's not worth anything. The bioethics board said so and then pretty soon it's,
[3:19:22.040 --> 3:19:25.720]  hey, let's just kill this kid. They're a little bit handicapped. Hey, let's have a law
[3:19:28.920 --> 3:19:33.560]  that if a kid's got any genetic problems or the government says they've got a genetic problem too
[3:19:33.560 --> 3:19:40.680]  aggressive that you can't have kids, let's go ahead and have Chinese style net censorship in
[3:19:40.680 --> 3:19:46.920]  Australia and the US. Both governments now proposing it. Australia's going ahead with it. Hey, what's
[3:19:46.920 --> 3:19:53.480]  wrong with having secret prisons? Hell, what's wrong with torture? Now that Hitler guy, he was
[3:19:53.480 --> 3:19:57.960]  bad when he did it, but when we do it, man, it's going to be mom and apple pie. It's going to be
[3:19:57.960 --> 3:20:05.560]  really great. Okay. Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.

[3:21:00.920 --> 3:21:06.760]  On the average Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire
[3:21:06.760 --> 3:21:12.200]  and live out their golden years. Unfortunately with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy,
[3:21:12.200 --> 3:21:17.240]  housing and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line. Is this a flaw
[3:21:17.240 --> 3:21:21.960]  free enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve note forcing us into perpetual
[3:21:21.960 --> 3:21:26.840]  debt ensuring inflation and higher taxes? These questions and more can be answered by reading
[3:21:26.840 --> 3:21:31.560]  G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island. Congressman Ron Paul states it's
[3:21:31.560 --> 3:21:36.760]  what every American needs to know about central bank power. A gripping adventure into the secret
[3:21:36.760 --> 3:21:41.720]  world of international banking cartel. Hi, this is Ted Anderson. I will give a silver dollar from

[3:21:49.800 --> 3:21:54.600]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system. Call and order your copy today

[3:22:02.360 --> 3:22:08.520]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance to not
[3:22:08.520 --> 3:22:14.120]  relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[3:22:14.120 --> 3:22:20.120]  at home. I've turned tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling
[3:22:20.120 --> 3:22:26.440]  the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention. Fall of
[3:22:26.440 --> 3:22:32.840]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation. The criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying
[3:22:32.840 --> 3:22:38.440]  sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke and Arsonists
[3:22:38.440 --> 3:22:43.000]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to? Today
[3:22:43.000 --> 3:22:49.720]  seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[3:24:13.000 --> 3:24:17.640]  Okay let's rush through some calls and then I do want to get into a whole area of news we haven't
[3:24:17.640 --> 3:24:26.840]  covered yet. Ash in Texas thanks for holding go ahead. Hey Alex how are you doing? Good. Hey and
[3:24:26.840 --> 3:24:32.040]  thanks for taking my call. I appreciate everything you're doing. I'm up here in Dallas and you know
[3:24:32.040 --> 3:24:36.840]  these chemtrails up here I don't know what's like in Austin but I'm sure it's the same. It's just
[3:24:36.840 --> 3:24:42.440]  unbelievable daily how they're just dosing us with Tic Tac Toe boards every day in Dallas.
[3:24:42.440 --> 3:24:49.480]  I mean that's the same thing down in Austin. Yeah all the chemtrail deniers really have a problem
[3:24:49.480 --> 3:24:55.000]  because our scientists came out for decades since it started in the mid 90s and said this is barium
[3:24:55.000 --> 3:24:59.800]  salt and aluminum dioxide. It appears to be a weather modification program but it also has toxic
[3:24:59.800 --> 3:25:08.200]  effects on all life especially mammals and then John P. Holdren came out and said headline in his
[3:25:08.200 --> 3:25:13.400]  first press conference. First thing he talked about was we've been secretly terraforming the earth
[3:25:13.400 --> 3:25:18.120]  to save you from global warming and we're now going to go from a test which is giant.
[3:25:20.280 --> 3:25:24.360]  You know it's like the Death Star blowing up Alderaan was just a test. I keep going back to
[3:25:24.360 --> 3:25:30.600]  Star Wars analogies they never end. It's like Chuck Norris Fax. I mean can you imagine what the
[3:25:30.600 --> 3:25:40.040]  non-test is? In fact people won't believe that. Google John P. Holdren Geoengineering calls
[3:25:40.040 --> 3:25:47.720]  for Geoengineering. He gave an AP press conference at AP headquarters in DC and so yes we have sent
[3:25:47.720 --> 3:25:52.920]  out researchers. We have shot chemtrail info. We are incorporating that into the next film.
[3:25:54.040 --> 3:26:00.440]  It's just there's so much. They've now declassified it but it's kind of like they declassified
[3:26:00.440 --> 3:26:05.000]  global government admit they're setting it up but still the public doesn't know it exists.
[3:26:05.000 --> 3:26:09.960]  I don't know how to explain that. It's just it's like telling children Santa Claus exists.
[3:26:09.960 --> 3:26:14.280]  They believe it but then you tell them that a Mack truck in the highway may kill them. They don't
[3:26:14.280 --> 3:26:20.360]  believe it. It's like a general public believes in fairy tales that polar bears can't swim
[3:26:20.360 --> 3:26:26.920]  and that the sun doesn't heat the earth but then they'll believe baloney but they won't believe
[3:26:26.920 --> 3:26:32.920]  the truth. The other day Alex they were spraying heavy duty. I called the sheriff's department.
[3:26:32.920 --> 3:26:37.320]  I'm here looking at chemtrails right now in Dallas but I called the sheriff's department and asked
[3:26:37.320 --> 3:26:41.560]  them what is this and they looked at me and said what's contrails and said no it's not.
[3:26:41.560 --> 3:26:45.480]  I said look at it. It's a tic-tac-toe board. He looked at it for a minute and he said you know
[3:26:45.480 --> 3:26:50.360]  you're right. He said we don't have any jurisdiction over that. He said but you need to call the FAA.
[3:26:50.360 --> 3:26:56.360]  So I called the FAA yesterday, called them both in San Antonio and over here in Fort Worth.
[3:26:56.360 --> 3:27:02.360]  I recorded the conversations and they first tried to tell me it was just contrails. I didn't know
[3:27:02.360 --> 3:27:06.840]  what I was talking about then but they didn't realize I'd been listening to you for a couple years
[3:27:07.400 --> 3:27:11.880]  so I hit them with what they're pouring out up there on us and I told them that it's probably
[3:27:11.880 --> 3:27:17.960]  all tied to HARP which is a lot of investigators believe it probably is to where they can send
[3:27:17.960 --> 3:27:25.480]  this electromagnetic waves through this. By the way there's more than one array. They've got six in
[3:27:25.480 --> 3:27:31.160]  Europe, a couple in Russia, some in China and several in the US and Canada. That Alaskan facility
[3:27:31.160 --> 3:27:36.440]  is not the only one. Well you know when I was in Spain this last summer Alex down in the Andalusia,
[3:27:36.440 --> 3:27:41.880]  down there in the southern Spain, here comes a plane way up there about 40,000 feet spewing
[3:27:41.880 --> 3:27:46.200]  chemtrails. I mean it's not a, you know there's a big difference between a contrail like when you
[3:27:46.200 --> 3:27:50.920]  and I grew up. No a condensation trail. We all grew up watching stays there for a few seconds or
[3:27:50.920 --> 3:27:57.880]  few minutes. It forms high up. Now they're low. They stay all day. They turn into cloud banks
[3:27:57.880 --> 3:28:03.720]  and then low and behold they just pulled up CBS News. They have this high altitude aerial spring
[3:28:03.720 --> 3:28:09.400]  campaign where they admit their quote, folks we have a global government that does whatever it
[3:28:09.400 --> 3:28:16.520]  wants in secret with unlimited funds. Heaven only knows what these nuts are up to. I mean do you
[3:28:16.520 --> 3:28:20.840]  understand? Yeah I mean I totally agree with you there. One other thing I wanted to say is I've waited
[3:28:20.840 --> 3:28:24.040]  a little while to talk to you. I've been dying to talk to you. No I won't be able to get to other
[3:28:24.040 --> 3:28:28.040]  people if we don't see how that works. But that's how it works. That's why you held is because I
[3:28:28.040 --> 3:28:33.320]  do give people time. Go ahead. On 9-11, one of the things, they're going to have this fake trial
[3:28:33.320 --> 3:28:41.080]  in New York. The info I have from the investigations, Kali Sheikh Mohammed is dead. Is that true?
[3:28:41.080 --> 3:28:48.840]  Well no. They said they bombed and killed him 16 times. It is the article Paul Watson wrote last
[3:28:48.840 --> 3:28:56.200]  year. So they claim they killed him a bunch before because they practiced lies. They set the precedent
[3:28:56.200 --> 3:29:01.480]  to say ridiculous things. Like they've killed the number three in Al Qaeda more than 20 times now
[3:29:02.200 --> 3:29:06.760]  and then they captured him. They admit they tortured his children, threatened his family
[3:29:06.760 --> 3:29:12.840]  and he confessed to bombing buildings that didn't exist for four years after he was incarcerated
[3:29:13.640 --> 3:29:20.040]  and it's just all a complete joke. It's like they said they killed chemical Ali five times.
[3:29:20.840 --> 3:29:26.360]  Well then they captured him. They say he died in 01 and this is what the intel I've read and I've
[3:29:26.360 --> 3:29:31.640]  read a lot of different things about it. That he died in 01 and that we haven't seen any photographs
[3:29:31.640 --> 3:29:35.560]  that, no new photographs of the guy. You always see the same one where he looks like he just got
[3:29:35.560 --> 3:29:40.040]  out from a night of drinking all night. That only photograph you see of him is that one and the
[3:29:40.040 --> 3:29:44.200]  reason why is... Well, sir, who knows? That's my whole point. There's a giant secret program
[3:29:44.200 --> 3:29:49.960]  spraying deadly chemicals on us. They now admit they're doing it. No one cares. Hooray cowboys.
[3:29:49.960 --> 3:29:58.760]  I love Alzheimer's. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:29:58.760 --> 3:30:06.600]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a battle
[3:30:06.600 --> 3:30:11.800]  and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be all I
[3:30:11.800 --> 3:30:17.480]  can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones. Food is your only ammunition.
[3:30:17.480 --> 3:30:22.760]  How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it?
[3:30:22.760 --> 3:30:27.400]  Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children
[3:30:27.400 --> 3:30:31.960]  sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[3:30:31.960 --> 3:30:36.680]  and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[3:30:36.680 --> 3:30:40.440]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[3:30:40.440 --> 3:30:45.640]  How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones.
[3:30:45.640 --> 3:30:53.640]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out
[3:30:53.640 --> 3:31:00.280]  on the web at eFoodsDirect.com. Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[3:31:23.640 --> 3:31:32.280]  1-800-691-6043, that's 1-800-691-6043.
[3:31:53.640 --> 3:32:06.120]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[3:32:06.120 --> 3:32:10.680]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick,
[3:32:10.680 --> 3:32:15.800]  go to the doctor and buy their drugs? You don't have to cooperate. There is a solution.
[3:32:15.800 --> 3:32:20.200]  Inner health botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for

[3:33:04.520 --> 3:33:11.080]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[3:33:11.080 --> 3:33:21.560]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network. I told you last week to tune in this week
[3:33:21.560 --> 3:33:29.160]  with that big guest. It doesn't stop with Chuck Norris. I'm just going to leave it at that.
[3:33:29.160 --> 3:33:39.800]  We've got other really informative, groundbreaking, first-time visiting guests later in the week,
[3:33:41.400 --> 3:33:47.160]  including Juan de Mara at 11.30, 30 minutes into the show, 11.30 central.
[3:33:50.200 --> 3:33:54.680]  So I'm certainly excited about that. Not quite as excited I am about the Luby's
[3:33:54.680 --> 3:34:02.680]  cafeteria food they just brought in. I'm in a hokey mood today.
[3:34:05.320 --> 3:34:12.360]  Quite a carbon footprint, though, with that evil steak. Nothing like a cafeteria chop steak for you,
[3:34:12.360 --> 3:34:19.960]  huh? Yeah, Craig just gave a eugenics quote. He said, if we kill off all the grannies,
[3:34:19.960 --> 3:34:25.320]  we could get through Luby's quicker. No, Luby's wouldn't have that niche market of grannies.
[3:34:25.320 --> 3:34:30.280]  And so those of us that like granny food won't be able to get it occasionally twice a year when we
[3:34:30.280 --> 3:34:35.480]  want it. You see, that's what the eugenicists think. They think if they wipe out certain ecosystems of
[3:34:35.480 --> 3:34:42.680]  human activity, that that will leave more for them. It actually creates less. We need 50 billion
[3:34:42.680 --> 3:34:51.160]  people to export giant space cities, deep space. Oh my God, the vision of humanity. We would just
[3:34:51.160 --> 3:34:57.560]  widen it. It was just unstoppable. Where is the race consciousness of humanity itself
[3:34:57.560 --> 3:35:01.640]  to people, the stars, that pioneering spirit? If you took transplants
[3:35:03.240 --> 3:35:09.080]  from the 17 and 1800s from the United States and trained them and brought them up today,
[3:35:09.080 --> 3:35:16.280]  we would already be on distant Pluto with giant star cruisers on their way to the nearest
[3:35:16.840 --> 3:35:23.160]  habitable planets. Guaranteed. Now, the globalists have already sent their probes out. They've got
[3:35:23.160 --> 3:35:28.360]  a lot of suppressed secret technology. They have that spirit, but it's twisted. They want us to
[3:35:28.360 --> 3:35:33.400]  forget about the real technology, forget about real issues, forget about the wonderment of the
[3:35:33.400 --> 3:35:39.960]  universe around us and walk into gas stations with our hair sticking up and grab a case and
[3:35:39.960 --> 3:35:45.480]  sit there with the guy behind the counter and go, I hope the cowboys do it again today.
[3:35:46.120 --> 3:35:51.320]  They ain't been doing too good. I was sitting there in a line trying to get my wife and I
[3:35:51.320 --> 3:35:57.400]  some coffee. She's out in the car with the kids as five adult men in front of me at this little
[3:35:57.400 --> 3:36:03.800]  gas station in our neighborhood. And they didn't care about the cowboys. The guy behind the counter
[3:36:03.800 --> 3:36:09.320]  didn't care. It was just what men do. And they walk up and put their beer down. That's what's
[3:36:09.320 --> 3:36:19.160]  manly. And they sit back and talk about the cowboys with people. And I'm not saying you're bad if
[3:36:19.160 --> 3:36:26.360]  you like the cowboys, but give me a break. The country's overrun with criminals. Men should
[3:36:26.360 --> 3:36:30.680]  be feverishly running around at city council and warning their neighbors and acting like men and
[3:36:30.680 --> 3:36:34.280]  saying, we've got to do something. We've got to rally. We've got to warn the people. You should
[3:36:34.280 --> 3:36:44.520]  be doing what I do. I'm actually normal. You are abnormal. And I'd walk and I'd watch the guy
[3:36:44.520 --> 3:36:51.560]  behind the counter. He was totally bored. He understands it's like the greeting, the pleasantry
[3:36:51.560 --> 3:36:58.200]  is, yes, cowboys was a foreigner. Cowboys. They would all have a cowboy discussion.
[3:36:59.960 --> 3:37:03.320]  By the way, did the cowboys win Sunday? I mean, this is what really matters.
[3:37:05.640 --> 3:37:13.800]  You don't think so. I think I'm going to throw up. I mean, I really do. I mean, I just get me out of
[3:37:13.800 --> 3:37:21.000]  here. You have a scientific dictatorship on record poisoning your water supply and
[3:37:21.000 --> 3:37:25.320]  saying they're doing it to brain damage you and sterilize you. They're openly been caught putting
[3:37:25.320 --> 3:37:31.400]  cancer viruses on the vaccines on purpose to sterilize you. They are spraying you with aluminum
[3:37:31.400 --> 3:37:41.160]  dioxide on purpose. And all you care about is the cowboys they lost to San Diego. That's the
[3:37:41.160 --> 3:37:53.720]  chargers I can show off that I know these things. It's just I can't believe it.
[3:37:57.880 --> 3:38:03.400]  All right, that's enough. I can't spend 10 minutes with the next caller, but I do want to
[3:38:03.400 --> 3:38:08.520]  hear from everybody. Paul in Canada, you're on the air. Go ahead. Hi there. Hey, buddy.
[3:38:08.520 --> 3:38:15.320]  Hey, just be quick. Just a couple points. I have a long time friend. He has a girlfriend who has
[3:38:15.320 --> 3:38:19.240]  an immediate family member in the RCMP and the guy's probably like 20, 21 years old.
[3:38:19.880 --> 3:38:24.120]  And when he's in training, he's telling my friend, oh, I just can't wait to get in there and rough
[3:38:24.120 --> 3:38:30.360]  people up and spying people and stuff like that. And they love him in there. They let him go on
[3:38:30.360 --> 3:38:35.000]  and get his own car within the first couple of weeks or month. And this is really the mentality
[3:38:35.000 --> 3:38:40.120]  of the people here in Canada that are signing up, you know, and it's pretty scary to see these
[3:38:40.120 --> 3:38:45.160]  little basically Nazis running around, you know, I don't know if you want to call me. I just had
[3:38:45.160 --> 3:38:53.560]  a couple of real men would be embarrassed of talking and acting like that. And no, I mean,
[3:38:53.560 --> 3:39:03.800]  they, they look for unstable video game players who were failed jocks, who weren't really popular,
[3:39:03.800 --> 3:39:12.280]  but wanted to be and who were bullies who finally got stood up to and they say, I'm getting a badge
[3:39:12.280 --> 3:39:19.560]  and gun that nobody can stand up against me. And I know there are good police out there. They send
[3:39:19.560 --> 3:39:26.440]  this information and they don't like the bad cops, but the system wants the bad cops. Let me tell
[3:39:26.440 --> 3:39:32.920]  you, I was in Canada, got off the airplane. They said the guy had a French accent. He said, come
[3:39:32.920 --> 3:39:41.640]  with me, Mr. Jones. And they just relish laughing at me and screaming at me. And I thought, man,
[3:39:42.840 --> 3:39:49.720]  I could imagine being such a coward and such a petty person that I would enjoy exercising
[3:39:49.720 --> 3:39:56.200]  power over people all day for no reason. I mean, I'm really an aggressive person and I had to hold
[3:39:56.200 --> 3:40:01.400]  back in not being aggressive with people. But no, these people, and it's embarrassing when I have
[3:40:01.400 --> 3:40:09.800]  to exercise power. I don't like it. It's, I have a natural governor there. And so, yeah, no, it's,
[3:40:09.800 --> 3:40:17.560]  it's, they're there to bang our heads and squeeze us and let us know. I mean, the Royal Mount of
[3:40:17.560 --> 3:40:23.320]  Police have been caught repeatedly in mainstream news. Just like I just said, you could pull up
[3:40:23.320 --> 3:40:27.880]  CBS news with them emitting their Kim trailing us. So they pulled it up. You can pull up Toronto
[3:40:27.880 --> 3:40:32.920]  Star, you name it. Royal Mount of Police. Let me see the exact headline of one of them.
[3:40:34.120 --> 3:40:41.560]  Royal Mount of Police admit staging event with officers.
[3:40:42.360 --> 3:40:47.560]  Royal Mount of Police admit their officers involved in scuffle and they just have them
[3:40:47.560 --> 3:40:52.680]  attack their own cops. And then they step aside and the criminal police know it's staged. They
[3:40:52.680 --> 3:40:56.920]  just want to attack the families that are out there protesting. And so they have a fake fight
[3:40:56.920 --> 3:41:01.240]  and they go, all right, we framed them. We're terrorists. Let's attack. Let's attack free speech
[3:41:01.240 --> 3:41:07.400]  now. And they just, it seems the weaker the person, the more they love beating women, old ladies,
[3:41:08.840 --> 3:41:13.720]  Portland, Oregon repeatedly, they love to go out to rallies and attack babies and baby carriages.
[3:41:13.720 --> 3:41:19.880]  And then scream, you bleepin, bleeper, you shouldn't bring a baby to a, to a vent. Like they'll,
[3:41:19.880 --> 3:41:25.720]  they'll spray your kid with the gas and then they'll billy club you for it, making them spray the
[3:41:25.720 --> 3:41:31.400]  kid. And hey, don't worry. And there it is. Canadian police caught attempting to stage riots.
[3:41:32.280 --> 3:41:36.440]  That was the original prison planet, but, but, but see if there's a link because of course we
[3:41:36.440 --> 3:41:40.200]  reported it, local activists exposed it, we reported it, then the police admitted it.
[3:41:40.760 --> 3:41:46.760]  Click on there and see. And so it takes a special kind of person to go out and stage events so you
[3:41:46.760 --> 3:41:53.560]  can attack protesters, real protesters, a lot of them wearing suits. Oh, you don't want a North
[3:41:53.560 --> 3:41:58.520]  American union. We got a bunch of goons that are terrorist and we're going to set you up so we can
[3:41:58.520 --> 3:42:05.480]  physically attack you. Uh, anything else? Uh, basically, I just wanted to shed some light.
[3:42:05.480 --> 3:42:11.800]  Do you know who Mark Emory is? Uh, it rings a little bit of a bell. Okay. Basically, he's from
[3:42:11.800 --> 3:42:18.360]  Vancouver, Canada. And, uh, he, uh, he runs a, uh, like he had a marijuana seed operation,
[3:42:18.360 --> 3:42:21.720]  basically, and he would sell seeds. Canadian government is totally fine. They took his
[3:42:21.720 --> 3:42:25.560]  tax money, no problem. He was sending seeds to the U S that was the biggest market.
[3:42:26.120 --> 3:42:31.960]  The DEA raided him in 2005. He's, uh, they're now on a big thing like to actually add him to
[3:42:31.960 --> 3:42:36.760]  the States right now. He wasn't remanded. Yes. Yes. I do. Paul, I appreciate your call. I am aware
[3:42:36.760 --> 3:42:43.160]  of how they couldn't shut down marijuana and it was its own underground industry and the globalist
[3:42:43.160 --> 3:42:48.200]  want the money and the power and they want you using their illegal drugs, you know, the drugs
[3:42:48.200 --> 3:42:53.240]  they control in certain regions, opiates and cocaine, and then their Prozac and other stuff they make,
[3:42:54.120 --> 3:42:59.480]  the Ritalin. And so they tricked everybody in 14 States and said, oh, we're going to decriminalize,
[3:42:59.480 --> 3:43:04.520]  set up your dispensaries. And now they're saying, yeah, we're going to let you have, you know,
[3:43:04.520 --> 3:43:10.360]  one dispensary for every 20 square miles now. So they're using regulation as a way to shutting it
[3:43:10.360 --> 3:43:14.200]  down. Just like they're using regulation to shut down the second amendment outside the law.
[3:43:14.200 --> 3:43:20.920]  And hey, good for them. Hey, good for the cops. Hey, take your vaccines, give you drink plenty
[3:43:20.920 --> 3:43:27.400]  of fluoride. I morally would say though, don't give it to your kid. Well, you know, maybe that's
[3:43:27.400 --> 3:43:32.040]  a blessing for you to give it to your kids. Maybe that's what you want. I mean, okay. Hey, you got
[3:43:32.040 --> 3:43:36.520]  power. Hey, don't let me get in the way of all your fun. What's your helping conjure up right now?
[3:43:36.520 --> 3:43:45.560]  No, you want this, you got it. Anything you want, you got it. Anything you need, you got it.
[3:43:46.280 --> 3:43:55.960]  Oh, baby. Every time I think about you, oh, my sweetie pie, your black ski mask, your camera,
[3:43:55.960 --> 3:44:05.000]  your prison camps, you're so tough. When you beat a young lady in the head or release a police
[3:44:05.000 --> 3:44:14.120]  dog or an old woman, anything you want, you got it. Your criminal thugs for offshore bankers, baby.
[3:44:16.680 --> 3:44:18.520]  There's some bad singing on purpose there.
[3:44:23.320 --> 3:44:27.560]  Every time I think about them, old women come out with bags out of a store
[3:44:27.560 --> 3:44:30.360]  and there's police going, no one on the streets of Pittsburgh. And you're like,
[3:44:30.360 --> 3:44:41.080]  officer, I'm just shopping, shut up, slam police dog. I mean, these are literal pet demons
[3:44:41.080 --> 3:44:47.400]  that are releasing on us. And all of you yuppies just can't wait to be just rampaged over. You love
[3:44:47.400 --> 3:44:55.240]  it. You love being weak scum. So you're going to get what you want now. I'm actually just sick of
[3:44:55.240 --> 3:45:09.080]  my stomach by it all. So I got to make a sick joke out of it all. Oh, you want slavery, you got it.
[3:45:11.880 --> 3:45:16.200]  Oh my God, was that that was bad? Wasn't it Craig? Is that my worst thing and ever?
[3:45:18.040 --> 3:45:22.040]  Oh man. No, actually, we're not in a police state. Everything's fine, folks.
[3:45:22.040 --> 3:45:29.960]  Everything. Hey, Glenn Beck's got a plan to fix it. Value added tax and sales tax. That'll teach
[3:45:29.960 --> 3:45:39.320]  the liberals. We're going to show them. Adam, you're on the air. Go ahead. Thanks for taking
[3:45:39.320 --> 3:45:48.520]  my call. Quick question. Is there a website, a one stop shop I can go to, to dig up these
[3:45:48.520 --> 3:45:53.240]  declassified articles? I talked to a lot of people and it's really hard to talk to them about what's
[3:45:53.240 --> 3:45:59.000]  going on today. But I can say, well, these are eugenicists and I explain what eugenics is.
[3:45:59.000 --> 3:46:06.600]  And then I can rattle off. I mean, you're like the Van Imp of conspiracy theories. You can say
[3:46:06.600 --> 3:46:15.800]  section article 45 reads. So is there a one stop shop I can go to to dig up all this information,
[3:46:15.800 --> 3:46:23.640]  not just on eugenics, but all like Tuskegee Project. I mean, the list can go on to tell
[3:46:23.640 --> 3:46:30.200]  these people, hey, look, this is what they've done in the past. This is their fruits. Look
[3:46:30.200 --> 3:46:35.960]  at the fruits of the labor. Who's saying they're not doing it right now? Hold on. I mean, you can
[3:46:35.960 --> 3:46:42.840]  give them scores of articles about one child policy being proposed at the Copenhagen event
[3:46:42.840 --> 3:46:49.640]  and world government being proposed. There's what is the endgame.com. It's an online bibliography
[3:46:50.680 --> 3:46:56.040]  for the film. So everything in the film is covered there. But I mean, what person does
[3:46:56.040 --> 3:47:04.120]  it know about Tuskegee? And I mean, I think we should keep educating people because now they're
[3:47:04.120 --> 3:47:12.520]  really ready to listen. But I mean, people ask for documentation. It's all over the place.
[3:47:12.520 --> 3:47:17.720]  I mean, I mean, what specifically? I mean, the Department of Energy admits they radiated
[3:47:18.360 --> 3:47:24.360]  4,300 plus American children, many of them to death in secret tests declassified in the 80s.
[3:47:25.960 --> 3:47:29.240]  They admit that 34 states passed laws for forced sterilization.
[3:47:31.640 --> 3:47:36.120]  I mean, the film endgame is a testament. It has all the documents and articles and
[3:47:36.920 --> 3:47:40.600]  things there and give people that film. I mean, what are they asking for?
[3:47:40.600 --> 3:47:47.960]  Well, in particular, it's just, I admire that you can rattle off all these, you know,
[3:47:49.080 --> 3:47:56.120]  things and sources. Yeah, but they can rattle off Dallas Cowboy scores. Anybody can do what I do.
[3:47:56.120 --> 3:48:01.160]  I've just been into this. I did have a lot of time to research all that because I'm a
[3:48:01.160 --> 3:48:05.720]  well, they better make the time. Well, I'm just seeing for myself. I mean,
[3:48:05.720 --> 3:48:10.920]  I would like to have a one stop. What's that website again? What is the endgame.com?
[3:48:10.920 --> 3:48:13.800]  What is the endgame.com? Okay. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it.
[3:48:13.800 --> 3:48:18.280]  Hey, thank you, Adam. I appreciate your call putting up with me because I mean, believe me.
[3:48:19.000 --> 3:48:23.640]  Look, that's the whole, that's the big joke here is I'm actually a sane person.
[3:48:25.320 --> 3:48:30.840]  And I decided that a government admittedly poisoning my water supply was more important
[3:48:30.840 --> 3:48:37.000]  than knowing about the Cowboys. Call me a cook, you know. Oh, there's a planetary world government
[3:48:37.000 --> 3:48:42.040]  that wants to set up a police state. So you can, if my daughter's ever tried to have children,
[3:48:42.040 --> 3:48:47.080]  kill their second born babies. Oh, that's being proposed publicly. Oh, I better get up off my
[3:48:47.080 --> 3:48:54.280]  fat butt and do something. They're like, I don't know, man. You're some kind of weirdo. Pretty wild.
[3:48:54.280 --> 3:49:02.040]  Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Just get me out of here. I mean, how do I shut this off? How do I?
[3:49:05.560 --> 3:49:10.200]  I'm going to shut up. Burn in Canada. We're on the air. Welcome, Burn.
[3:49:11.160 --> 3:49:17.000]  Hey, Alex. Hey, pal. Hey, I just want to bring you up to speed what's happening in British Columbia,
[3:49:17.000 --> 3:49:23.560]  Canada. We've been paying the carbon tax for over a year now on our hydro and our gas or
[3:49:23.560 --> 3:49:29.640]  natural gas. Yes. And our little premier there, Mr. Gordon Pugh Campbell, has gone
[3:49:29.640 --> 3:49:38.120]  to Copenhagen with Mr. Harper with his checkbook. You know, he went to, I think, the Bank of England
[3:49:38.120 --> 3:49:43.880]  here a couple of years ago and borrowed a whole whack of cash for our Olympics. And, you know,
[3:49:43.880 --> 3:49:48.760]  the Bank of Canada just can't come up with the money, I guess. And, you know, it's the point now
[3:49:48.760 --> 3:49:54.600]  where they're double. And remember, he was going to be the conservative and he spoke out
[3:49:55.160 --> 3:50:01.080]  against Bilderberg. And now he's completely run by them. Oh, yeah. Yeah. He's a big kind of freemason
[3:50:01.080 --> 3:50:06.200]  in the whole nine yards that, you know, he got busted in Hawaii for drinking and driving. And
[3:50:06.920 --> 3:50:11.400]  everybody looked the other way. And, you know, his mug shot, he's smiling and snickering the
[3:50:11.400 --> 3:50:17.720]  little puke. But, yeah, just to let you know, you know, we're already been paying this carbon
[3:50:17.720 --> 3:50:23.160]  tax here for a year. And I don't know, where is it going? You know, is he just sending it over
[3:50:23.160 --> 3:50:27.960]  there? Is it collecting interest anywhere? Well, I remember three years ago, Canada passed it,
[3:50:27.960 --> 3:50:32.280]  but it had that staggered thing where it was started in a year and a half. So you've had it
[3:50:32.280 --> 3:50:36.440]  for a year and a half. And they're saying it's going to, they're going to expand it. It's an
[3:50:36.440 --> 3:50:41.320]  open-ended mandate. And I would have guests on and they would say, there's no carbon tax in Canada.
[3:50:41.320 --> 3:50:48.920]  You're a liar. See how they denied it right up until it was too late? I mean, they just,
[3:50:48.920 --> 3:50:54.760]  it's all a military handbook they use. I appreciate your call. I mean, these people are
[3:50:54.760 --> 3:50:59.560]  just a pack of scum criminals. What does it take for people to get it? And they're arming against
[3:50:59.560 --> 3:51:05.560]  us with paramilitary police. When the electricity goes out, how will you boil water, cook dinner,
[3:51:05.560 --> 3:51:09.480]  light your home, or get news reports? Most families are not prepared for even the shortest

[3:52:12.440 --> 3:52:17.320]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home. We're turning members' influence
[3:52:17.320 --> 3:52:23.080]  on our president and Congress, and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon
[3:52:23.080 --> 3:52:29.320]  all of us as American citizens to pay attention. For the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[3:52:29.320 --> 3:52:35.160]  nation, the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes
[3:52:35.160 --> 3:52:39.640]  constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for
[3:52:39.640 --> 3:52:44.280]  more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to? Today seems like nobody
[3:52:44.280 --> 3:52:51.160]  does care. And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy

[3:54:07.240 --> 3:54:13.880]  I'll be back tomorrow. Cover a lot more news and information. It was a 35-minute speech roughly
[3:54:14.440 --> 3:54:18.440]  on the floor of the house. Congressman Dana Rohrbacher, who we interviewed about 10 years ago,
[3:54:18.440 --> 3:54:26.600]  we ought to get Rohrbacher back on talking about the global government. And the title of this clip,
[3:54:26.600 --> 3:54:33.240]  we just searched it, was Congressman Rohrbacher channels Alex Jones. So here's a short clip of that.
[3:54:34.440 --> 3:54:41.640]  Copenhagen may well lay the foundations for the future that the globalists who are pushing this
[3:54:41.640 --> 3:54:50.360]  agenda envision for us. What the Copenhagen crowd would mandate and can be traced back to that
[3:54:50.360 --> 3:54:57.080]  same alliance between our domestic radical environmentalists and a globalist elite. This
[3:54:57.080 --> 3:55:04.200]  unholy alliance has already had an impact. A few decades ago, the global radical environmental
[3:55:04.200 --> 3:55:11.640]  alliance, the globalist radical environmental alliance latched on to an apocalyptic theory to
[3:55:11.640 --> 3:55:17.880]  justify their power grab. This is a product of a radical environmentalist globalist coalition.
[3:55:17.880 --> 3:55:24.280]  This is about centralizing power into the hands of global government. That's what Kyoto and Copenhagen
[3:55:24.280 --> 3:55:30.760]  are all about. That's what the radical environmentalists and globalist alliance is all about. Wake up
[3:55:30.760 --> 3:55:38.360]  America. We still have time to turn this around. We must fight the globalist click that is trying
[3:55:38.360 --> 3:55:46.200]  to shackle future generations of Americans to a burden of economy killing debt. They are changed
[3:55:46.200 --> 3:55:53.560]  that will be hard to break, but we must have the strength and the commitment to do so.
[3:55:53.560 --> 3:56:01.480]  We will not give up our freedom and we are not powerless. We will stand together. Americans
[3:56:01.480 --> 3:56:09.080]  of every race and religion, a very ethnic group and social status. We will fight as united patriots
[3:56:09.080 --> 3:56:16.520]  and we will win. Members of Congress need to hear from angry constituents and I predict they will.
[3:56:16.520 --> 3:56:23.240]  Now think progress. Put that clip out. That's George Soros funded. I've looked him up.
[3:56:23.240 --> 3:56:29.720]  It's one of his publications. Like that's discrediting Rohrbacher. I mean, you've got
[3:56:29.720 --> 3:56:35.560]  Bandkai Moon, Von Rumpi, all the heads of it saying global government. The stinking treaty
[3:56:35.560 --> 3:56:42.920]  says global governance. Al Gore says global governance. And they, they keep playing along
[3:56:42.920 --> 3:56:46.520]  like we want global government. We're going to take over one child policy, but none of it exists
[3:56:46.520 --> 3:56:51.320]  and you're a crazy cook. If you talk about it, I mean, it's like they are the arbiters of reality.
[3:56:51.320 --> 3:56:56.440]  But see, people aren't listening to them anymore. You miss might have worked 10 years ago to tell
[3:56:56.440 --> 3:57:01.800]  people there were no Kim drills or no new world order, but you can't have the White House science
[3:57:01.800 --> 3:57:07.960]  are going actually, since my days at Harvard, I've been involved in a secret terraforming project
[3:57:07.960 --> 3:57:13.080]  on planet earth called geoengineering to stop the global warming. We're now going from the
[3:57:13.080 --> 3:57:19.320]  testing phase to the operational phase. I mean, you can pull up the YouTube of him and an AP
[3:57:19.320 --> 3:57:27.320]  press conference saying it, they're spraying you and the stupid cops don't care. They love it.
[3:57:27.320 --> 3:57:32.440]  They love their kids being retarded. I mean, I, I know a lot of cops are waking up. Look,
[3:57:33.960 --> 3:57:37.800]  police, I talk a lot about you because you're going to be used to enforce all this and you're
[3:57:37.800 --> 3:57:44.200]  destroying yourselves as well. And I just, I'm telling you the truth. The world government's real.
[3:57:44.200 --> 3:57:51.080]  We have to stand up against it. We have to say no. I'm out of time. I apologize to Joe and Brian
[3:57:51.080 --> 3:57:53.400]  and Paul and Chris. If you call back tomorrow, I'll put you to the head of the line. We do
[3:57:53.400 --> 3:58:03.800]  have some really big guests up tomorrow as well. I wanted to just add here that it is Christmas

[3:58:51.480 --> 3:58:56.040]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[3:58:56.040 --> 3:59:01.240]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two,
[3:59:01.240 --> 3:59:06.120]  our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[3:59:06.120 --> 3:59:11.800]  It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[3:59:11.800 --> 3:59:16.760]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now
[3:59:16.760 --> 3:59:22.200]  new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always
[3:59:22.200 --> 3:59:26.680]  a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related
[3:59:26.680 --> 3:59:31.800]  onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[3:59:31.800 --> 3:59:35.880]  mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[3:59:35.880 --> 3:59:41.800]  one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's
