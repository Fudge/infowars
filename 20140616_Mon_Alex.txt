[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:33.000]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:33.000 --> 00:39.000]  We're here in McAllen, Texas were just moments ago a busload of children were picked up by a church group
[00:39.000 --> 00:45.000]  now we've seen the reports coming out of the South American countries many children are coming from the South American countries
[00:45.000 --> 00:51.000]  surrendering themselves to board patrol at which point they come to a place like this or they're picked up by a church group
[00:51.000 --> 00:57.000]  and then they end up at a military base now as you can see behind me there's a van that's ready to transport some children
[00:57.000 --> 01:01.000]  I'm not sure if they're going to a military base I'm not sure if they're going to another church facility
[01:01.000 --> 01:06.000]  but as you recall our reporters went to San Antonio, Texas and encountered some children at a base there
[01:06.000 --> 01:11.000]  and there's nothing wrong with wanting to come to this country I understand this is the greatest country in the world
[01:11.000 --> 01:16.000]  despite the problems that we have but you have to do this the legal and lawful way especially when we have veterans
[01:16.000 --> 01:22.000]  who cannot get care at the VA facilities especially when we have veterans who are homeless in the United States of America
[01:22.000 --> 01:27.000]  yet we're bringing in people from other countries and housing them at our military bases
[01:27.000 --> 01:33.000]  right now we see a van load of children as I previously mentioned they just recently entered this van
[01:33.000 --> 01:38.000]  now where they're going we're not sure but we have very good reason to suspect these are illegal immigrants
[01:38.000 --> 01:43.000]  now just moments ago as we were watching that van leave another van pulled up more kids got in and were taken off
[01:43.000 --> 01:49.000]  now as I said these children oftentimes are coming from Central American countries they get picked up by a church group
[01:49.000 --> 01:54.000]  they get picked up by the board of patrol they surrender themselves and they end up at a military facility
[01:54.000 --> 02:01.000]  now it just doesn't seem right to me that these children are at military facilities when our own veterans are sleeping homeless on the streets
[02:01.000 --> 02:04.000]  you can come to this country but you have to do it the legal and lawful way
[02:04.000 --> 02:08.000]  you can find more reports at infowars.com
[02:08.000 --> 02:15.000]  and our reporters are on the ground they filed that at about 6 a.m. this morning on the Texas-Mexico border
[02:15.000 --> 02:21.000]  hiding in plain view is not the immigration crisis that the mainstream media keeps calling this
[02:21.000 --> 02:26.000]  as if it just happened like a tornado or a hurricane or an earthquake
[02:26.000 --> 02:33.000]  the issue is this is premeditated premeditated
[02:33.000 --> 02:41.000]  trafficking of children by the federal government and its NGOs that are like Acre
[02:41.000 --> 02:46.000]  and we're looking into the organization we're looking into the white vans
[02:46.000 --> 02:51.000]  we're looking into that but now they have found since they filed this report this morning
[02:51.000 --> 02:57.000]  they found where the vans are indeed going it's churches and then they're staging them from there on flights
[02:57.000 --> 03:03.000]  and other bus rides around the country and they're telling anybody from Latin America you can get here
[03:03.000 --> 03:10.000]  vans are waiting and you're also in many cases a bus to military bases
[03:10.000 --> 03:15.000]  so this is a premeditated operation we know it is by Obama and the globalists
[03:15.000 --> 03:19.000]  we're looking at specific groups and organizations on the Texas border
[03:19.000 --> 03:24.000]  and they're going to have more video stills and more the crew went down there yesterday
[03:24.000 --> 03:31.000]  and Jacari Jackson and others are doing a great job with the Don Salazar and John Baum
[03:31.000 --> 03:40.000]  and we're going to have a report from them later in the transmission

[03:56.000 --> 04:01.000]  I know he doesn't want to make an issue out of it but he's been fighting the globalists for 50 years

[04:07.000 --> 04:13.000]  and I will see if he'll talk about that on air for folks but serious health issues

[06:25.000 --> 06:29.000]  few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide

[08:18.000 --> 08:38.000]  the headline is up on infowars.com and prismplanet.com
[08:38.000 --> 08:45.000]  church group ships illegals deeper into the United States as the headline
[08:45.000 --> 08:51.000]  Obama has encouraged illegals worldwide to come here and they will be instantly legalized once they get here
[08:51.000 --> 08:57.000]  including children, so parents are now dumping their children off on aircraft or on Greyhound buses
[08:57.000 --> 09:02.000]  on the US side of the border, church groups affiliated with the Democratic Party
[09:02.000 --> 09:08.000]  load the illegals up, ship them in and they are home free, get them signed up for welfare
[09:08.000 --> 09:12.000]  and then the churches get a nice cut of that in donations
[09:12.000 --> 09:18.000]  so that's how that works and then they vote to take our guns
[09:18.000 --> 09:23.000]  they vote to fully enslave the nation
[09:23.000 --> 09:28.000]  and that is the program and they've done it in Europe as well
[09:28.000 --> 09:34.000]  DrudgeReport.com linked to our article
[09:34.000 --> 09:37.000]  churches aiding invasion of illegals
[09:37.000 --> 09:41.000]  that's right that's what's going on here
[09:41.000 --> 09:44.000]  that is exactly what's going on here
[09:44.000 --> 09:47.000]  and above that article
[09:47.000 --> 09:53.000]  Teenage Latin Horde more than 35,000 entering Texas each month
[09:53.000 --> 09:55.000]  that's a low number
[09:55.000 --> 10:02.000]  and our people are there as buses pull up every few minutes dumping off teenagers
[10:02.000 --> 10:06.000]  between 14 and 18
[10:06.000 --> 10:16.000]  I guess because it's seen that oh it's the children we've got to give them free welfare
[10:16.000 --> 10:18.000]  this is incredible
[10:18.000 --> 10:21.000]  meth pours into Central California
[10:21.000 --> 10:25.000]  migrant surge, jams, border
[10:25.000 --> 10:31.000]  American IT workers forced to train guest workers hired to replace them
[10:31.000 --> 10:36.000]  that's from computer world, GOP demands Obama deploy National Guard
[10:36.000 --> 10:39.000]  Washington Times, churches aiding invasion of illegals
[10:39.000 --> 10:44.000]  infowars.com, Teenage Latin Horde, National Review
[10:44.000 --> 10:48.000]  and then they spin it in the media like don't you want to be nice to Latin Americans
[10:48.000 --> 10:50.000]  what you don't like them
[10:50.000 --> 10:52.000]  ladies and gentlemen
[10:52.000 --> 10:56.000]  they're advertising that the border is totally open and anybody can come here
[10:56.000 --> 10:58.000]  and have a baby for free or anything
[10:58.000 --> 11:01.000]  completely bankrupt
[11:01.000 --> 11:03.000]  and again I'll be honest with you
[11:03.000 --> 11:06.000]  these people are all pro-gun, pro-liberty, pro-freedom
[11:06.000 --> 11:08.000]  we do need more people in this country
[11:08.000 --> 11:10.000]  because we've aborted 53 million Americans
[11:10.000 --> 11:14.000]  since Roe v. Wade in 73
[11:14.000 --> 11:18.000]  74, Roe v. Wade was in 73 but started in 74
[11:18.000 --> 11:20.000]  abortion wholesale
[11:20.000 --> 11:23.000]  but this is people with diseases
[11:23.000 --> 11:25.000]  people with criminal records
[11:25.000 --> 11:27.000]  people with no hope
[11:27.000 --> 11:29.000]  destitute, people with no education
[11:29.000 --> 11:33.000]  it is the dregs of Latin America
[11:33.000 --> 11:37.000]  80% of immigration to the US is now from Mexico alone folks
[11:37.000 --> 11:39.000]  that's what we're talking about
[11:39.000 --> 11:41.000]  that's the illegal immigration, 80%
[11:41.000 --> 11:42.000]  what we're talking about Latin America all day
[11:42.000 --> 11:46.000]  Latin America's population is doubling every 30 years
[11:46.000 --> 11:49.000]  and they're being taught in Latin America that America
[11:49.000 --> 11:52.000]  that the American taxpayer is a piece of garbage
[11:52.000 --> 11:54.000]  devil gringo pig
[11:54.000 --> 11:58.000]  who was born, born
[11:58.000 --> 12:01.000]  to be lowly conquisteds by the La Raza
[12:01.000 --> 12:04.000]  and it's all racial nomenclature
[12:04.000 --> 12:06.000]  funded by the Ford Foundation, the CIA
[12:06.000 --> 12:10.000]  and others to make sure Latin America never becomes free
[12:10.000 --> 12:13.000]  Latin America would be a wonderful place if they ever had any freedom
[12:13.000 --> 12:17.000]  I'm trying to preserve a little bit of freedom we've got left here
[12:17.000 --> 12:19.000]  this is chaos
[12:19.000 --> 12:22.000]  the globalists are moving on every front to implode the world
[12:22.000 --> 12:24.000]  they're putting Nazis in
[12:24.000 --> 12:27.000]  to overthrow Ukraine, start a war with Russia
[12:27.000 --> 12:31.000]  head of NATO says that Russia considers them to be an opponent
[12:31.000 --> 12:34.000]  so they're preparing for basically war with Russia
[12:34.000 --> 12:36.000]  when the West are starting with Russia
[12:36.000 --> 12:39.000]  again I'm not on quote Russia's side
[12:39.000 --> 12:41.000]  but Russia's doing nothing to me
[12:41.000 --> 12:44.000]  the giant embassy that costs 10 billion dollars
[12:44.000 --> 12:46.000]  or whatever to build in Baghdad
[12:46.000 --> 12:49.000]  is falling to al-Qaeda right now
[12:49.000 --> 12:54.000]  USA Today reports US evacuates embassy as bombs
[12:54.000 --> 12:57.000]  fighting rock Iraq
[12:57.000 --> 13:00.000]  and as al-Qaeda begins to enter the city
[13:00.000 --> 13:03.000]  and this ISIS or ISIS group folks is
[13:03.000 --> 13:05.000]  Wahhabis out of Saudi Arabia
[13:05.000 --> 13:08.000]  Kurt Nemo wrote two articles yesterday
[13:08.000 --> 13:10.000]  in fact I meant to pull those guys
[13:10.000 --> 13:12.000]  you pulled me out of the news archive thank you
[13:12.000 --> 13:15.000]  and we have a skeleton crew today because John Bounds down at the border
[13:15.000 --> 13:22.000]  at the bottom next hour
[13:22.000 --> 13:27.000]  and quite frankly I've now reached the point
[13:27.000 --> 13:34.000]  where I'm having trouble doing this radio show
[13:34.000 --> 13:41.000]  I just it's like reporting from a command base
[13:41.000 --> 13:43.000]  that's falling and being completely overrun
[13:43.000 --> 13:46.000]  it's like saying Imperial troops were in the base
[13:46.000 --> 13:49.000]  Imperial troops were in the base
[13:49.000 --> 13:52.000]  to use a cheesy analogy from Empire Strikes Back
[13:52.000 --> 13:55.000]  and the general public still has no idea
[13:55.000 --> 13:57.000]  that worldwide the criminals that run our country
[13:57.000 --> 13:59.000]  are imploding us financially
[13:59.000 --> 14:01.000]  imploding our borders
[14:01.000 --> 14:04.000]  imploding Eastern Europe, imploding Iraq
[14:04.000 --> 14:07.000]  mainstream news admits in the back of the paper
[14:07.000 --> 14:11.000]  yeah Saudi Arabia and the West helped arm this ISIS group
[14:11.000 --> 14:15.000]  in areas they controlled in Syria
[14:15.000 --> 14:18.000]  to now pour across and take over Iraq
[14:18.000 --> 14:20.000]  that was always the plan
[14:20.000 --> 14:25.000]  and they've got the police nationwide training right now
[14:25.000 --> 14:31.000]  to take on the Tea Party veterans and Godowners
[14:31.000 --> 14:33.000]  and they're going to do it
[14:33.000 --> 14:36.000]  and cause a civil war here just like they're doing in Iraq
[14:36.000 --> 14:41.000]  or Syria or Ukraine or Libya or Egypt
[14:41.000 --> 14:44.000]  this is global Illuminati revolution
[14:44.000 --> 14:46.000]  this is what they did in France
[14:46.000 --> 14:48.000]  they tried to do it here but patriots took it over
[14:48.000 --> 14:50.000]  away from them and redirected it
[14:50.000 --> 14:52.000]  so we got the Republic
[14:52.000 --> 14:55.000]  and from the time of the Jacobins in 1800
[14:55.000 --> 14:59.000]  they have always been swearing to retake this country
[14:59.000 --> 15:03.000]  and it is a political philosophy of order out of chaos
[15:03.000 --> 15:06.000]  and until the public figures that out
[15:06.000 --> 15:12.000]  we don't have a snowball's chance in Hades
[15:12.000 --> 15:14.000]  of doing anything about this
[15:14.000 --> 15:17.000]  I mean this is so serious
[15:17.000 --> 15:20.000]  that I'm like someone that's lost family members
[15:20.000 --> 15:22.000]  I mean watching this country die
[15:22.000 --> 15:24.000]  I'm not putting on a joke here
[15:24.000 --> 15:25.000]  the crew knows it
[15:25.000 --> 15:28.000]  I'm barely almost didn't go on air today
[15:28.000 --> 15:30.000]  because I don't know
[15:30.000 --> 15:34.000]  I don't know if I can sit here for three hours and even look at this going on anymore
[15:34.000 --> 15:36.000]  man I mean
[15:40.000 --> 15:42.000]  and then I look at the yuppies
[15:42.000 --> 15:47.000]  who've been pre-programmed to take everything like it's no big deal
[15:47.000 --> 15:50.000]  and to take the border being fully imploded
[15:50.000 --> 15:53.000]  and Democratic Party operative churches
[15:53.000 --> 15:55.000]  the Catholic Church called for it two years ago
[15:55.000 --> 15:57.000]  all these big Baptist churches, Methodist churches
[15:57.000 --> 15:59.000]  I don't care who they are they're doing it
[15:59.000 --> 16:01.000]  I'm just tossing the illegals in saying
[16:01.000 --> 16:04.000]  all immigrants are just humans let them in
[16:04.000 --> 16:07.000]  but I can't go to any of their countries and get anything free
[16:07.000 --> 16:09.000]  no it's only politically correct
[16:09.000 --> 16:12.000]  we pay for everything and it's a total plan
[16:12.000 --> 16:17.000]  and then even the liberty movement doesn't understand what's happening to them
[16:17.000 --> 16:21.000]  I see the headlines about crisis on the border
[16:21.000 --> 16:28.000]  it's not a crisis in the word people are saying like it just happened
[16:28.000 --> 16:31.000]  we've got on screen right now if you're a TV viewer
[16:31.000 --> 16:36.000]  shots of the buses coming in from Mexico
[16:36.000 --> 16:38.000]  with the kids with no parents
[16:38.000 --> 16:41.000]  being put on church buses and shipped to churches
[16:41.000 --> 16:43.000]  and we've got our reporters there
[16:43.000 --> 16:46.000]  I want them to tenaciously go in
[16:46.000 --> 16:49.000]  and say who's funding this
[16:49.000 --> 16:51.000]  and where are these children's parents
[16:51.000 --> 16:54.000]  and nicely ask you know oh so these children are from Mexico
[16:54.000 --> 16:57.000]  and again there's no border patrol now they've been told stand down
[16:57.000 --> 16:59.000]  at the border the buses pull in
[16:59.000 --> 17:01.000]  pass the border patrol
[17:01.000 --> 17:03.000]  they pull up their kids get off
[17:03.000 --> 17:05.000]  they get on buses and come into the U.S.
[17:05.000 --> 17:07.000]  they're in the U.S.
[17:07.000 --> 17:10.000]  but if I want to go to Mexico and I fly in
[17:10.000 --> 17:15.000]  why is your passport only got a year left on it
[17:15.000 --> 17:17.000]  what are you carrying your bags
[17:17.000 --> 17:18.000]  are you a drug dealer
[17:18.000 --> 17:20.000]  and I always look at them
[17:20.000 --> 17:22.000]  I'm flying from Europe in a manner and I go
[17:22.000 --> 17:24.000]  everybody knows the government ships most of the drugs in the launders
[17:24.000 --> 17:26.000]  the money I don't have any drug record
[17:26.000 --> 17:28.000]  and my passport
[17:28.000 --> 17:32.000]  this is all just social engineering to make me feel
[17:32.000 --> 17:34.000]  like I'm a bad person that can't be trusted
[17:34.000 --> 17:36.000]  you know this country is wide open
[17:36.000 --> 17:39.000]  folks I've been flying all over the country
[17:39.000 --> 17:41.000]  and seeing the illegals waving a piece of paper
[17:41.000 --> 17:42.000]  consul matricula
[17:42.000 --> 17:44.000]  and the TSA takes them to have the line
[17:44.000 --> 17:47.000]  and they let them through with no no no proof
[17:47.000 --> 17:50.000]  the truth is it's all a joke okay
[17:50.000 --> 17:54.000]  the TSA and the border patrol
[17:54.000 --> 17:57.000]  are there to train us
[17:57.000 --> 17:59.000]  now the border patrols been doing a hard job for a long time
[17:59.000 --> 18:01.000]  now they're like TSA
[18:01.000 --> 18:03.000]  and they don't like what's happening
[18:03.000 --> 18:06.000]  but now they're being told you're there to supply diapers
[18:06.000 --> 18:09.000]  and hot formula to the illegal alien babies
[18:09.000 --> 18:11.000]  when the mamas get off the planes
[18:11.000 --> 18:13.000]  and when the mamas come across
[18:13.000 --> 18:19.000]  I mean this this this is 100% premeditated revolution
[18:19.000 --> 18:24.000]  against this country
[18:24.000 --> 18:27.000]  and it's the MS-13 and the Mexican mafia
[18:27.000 --> 18:29.000]  and all of this totally racial
[18:29.000 --> 18:33.000]  totally criminal totally dedicated
[18:33.000 --> 18:35.000]  all over the United States
[18:35.000 --> 18:38.000]  I mean really they don't really target white people
[18:38.000 --> 18:42.000]  the MS-13 and targets other Hispanics
[18:42.000 --> 18:43.000]  and blacks
[18:43.000 --> 18:46.000]  and that's a well-known phenomenon from Texas to California
[18:46.000 --> 18:49.000]  of some weekends 20 plus blacks are shot
[18:49.000 --> 18:52.000]  as their old gang territories are destroyed
[18:52.000 --> 18:58.000]  and shoved into tiny black islands
[18:58.000 --> 19:00.000]  that's part of what's going on in Chicago
[19:00.000 --> 19:03.000]  I mean this is just a mess folks
[19:03.000 --> 19:04.000]  this is a total mess
[19:04.000 --> 19:07.000]  there it is, Mexican cartels, allegedly hard MS-13 to carry out
[19:07.000 --> 19:11.000]  torture operation in Minnesota
[19:11.000 --> 19:15.000]  and these these these these drug cults worship the grim reaper folks
[19:15.000 --> 19:18.000]  they're all it's a death cult into being killed
[19:18.000 --> 19:21.000]  so the police are scared of them too
[19:21.000 --> 19:24.000]  just totally desperate people from a totally failed
[19:24.000 --> 19:26.000]  collapsed Mexico
[19:26.000 --> 19:28.000]  where now a female and male version of the grim reaper
[19:28.000 --> 19:30.000]  worship I'm not talking about
[19:30.000 --> 19:32.000]  day of the dead folks where you remember your ancestors
[19:32.000 --> 19:36.000]  I'm talking about actual death worship
[19:36.000 --> 19:39.000]  and the average American has no idea what's even going on
[19:39.000 --> 19:43.000]  I mean this country is in free fall right now
[19:43.000 --> 19:45.000]  free fall
[19:45.000 --> 19:47.000]  this is the age of revolution
[19:47.000 --> 19:49.000]  the globalists are bringing in the collapse worldwide
[19:49.000 --> 19:51.000]  undoubtedly this is only the beginning
[19:51.000 --> 19:53.000]  it's only going to accelerate now
[19:53.000 --> 20:18.000]  and we're just sitting here watching
[20:18.000 --> 20:29.000]  thanks
[20:29.000 --> 20:32.840]  Ted Anderson, have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk
[20:32.840 --> 20:33.840]  about gold IRAs?
[20:33.840 --> 20:38.400]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value
[20:38.400 --> 20:40.040]  of gold for your retirement.
[20:40.040 --> 20:43.480]  Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[20:43.480 --> 20:48.400]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[20:48.400 --> 20:54.160]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns, call 800-686-2237.
[20:54.160 --> 20:57.640]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[20:57.640 --> 21:01.080]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Groot.
[21:01.080 --> 21:06.720]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity
[21:06.720 --> 21:08.520]  iodine available.
[21:08.520 --> 21:16.920]  The new survival shield X2 is mined from 7 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine,
[21:16.920 --> 21:19.320]  environmentally clean conditions.
[21:19.320 --> 21:27.520]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million-plus year-old deposit
[21:27.520 --> 21:28.920]  deep in the earth.
[21:28.920 --> 21:33.400]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[21:33.400 --> 21:37.680]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[21:37.680 --> 21:39.800]  Experience the new formula.
[21:39.800 --> 21:42.080]  Experience the ancient purity.
[21:42.080 --> 21:43.520]  Shield your family.
[21:43.520 --> 21:48.120]  Survival Shield X2, available now at infowarslife.com.
[21:48.120 --> 22:01.840]  Or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[22:01.840 --> 22:06.880]  In the U.S., one in every 50 homes will have a break in this year.
[22:06.880 --> 22:09.320]  Burglars call it smash and grab.
[22:09.320 --> 22:11.240]  Police call it robbery.
[22:11.240 --> 22:13.120]  We call it avoidable.
[22:13.120 --> 22:19.240]  We are fake TV, a simple electronic device that can fool even professional burglars.
[22:19.240 --> 22:24.560]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet and simulates the changing colors of a television.
[22:24.560 --> 22:29.200]  To a burglar, it looks like someone must be home watching TV, so they'll likely move
[22:29.200 --> 22:31.760]  on to an easier target.
[22:31.760 --> 22:37.520]  At only $29.95, fake TV costs less than a month of most alarm-monitoring plans and comes
[22:37.520 --> 22:43.680]  with free shipping, or to your fake TV by calling 877-5-FAKE-TV.
[22:43.680 --> 23:10.040]  Or go to faketv.com, that's 877-532-5388 or faketv.com.
[23:10.040 --> 23:26.120]  The
[23:26.120 --> 23:31.040]  first step towards self-reliance in the face of disaster is a visit to mypatriotsupply.com.
[23:31.040 --> 23:36.120]  There you'll find the absolute best prices on storable foods, non-GMO seeds, emergency

[23:42.080 --> 23:49.720]  Visit us online or call 866-229-0927, that's 866-229-0927 and speak to one of our preparedness
[23:49.720 --> 23:51.000]  advisors today.
[23:51.000 --> 24:17.000]  Remember before it's time to survive, it's time to prepare, mypatriotsupply.com.
[24:17.000 --> 24:46.800]  I'm not trying to be negative here, but we are facing
[24:46.800 --> 24:57.320]  21st century warfare right now, and I don't know how much worse it's got to get before
[24:57.320 --> 25:00.000]  people stop complying with the system.
[25:00.000 --> 25:08.320]  We have a system where justice has been turned on its head, where everything is inverted.
[25:08.320 --> 25:13.960]  You can type into a search engine, churches call for borders to be opened, churches call
[25:13.960 --> 25:16.320]  for all migrants to be legalized.
[25:16.320 --> 25:21.520]  That's 7 billion people.
[25:21.520 --> 25:24.760]  That destroys markets.
[25:24.760 --> 25:30.720]  When someone at IBM, all the IBM engineers I know, I know four of them, in a neighborhood
[25:30.720 --> 25:36.320]  I lived in years ago, sat in contact with them, all of them lost their jobs in the last
[25:36.320 --> 25:39.000]  four or five years.
[25:39.000 --> 25:45.000]  They were made to train Indian replacements who were paid about a quarter what they are,
[25:45.000 --> 25:49.240]  and then they lost their jobs and their Indian replacements trained more Indian replacements,
[25:49.240 --> 25:54.720]  and then they had their pay cut even more, and then IBM moved to India, and the standard
[25:54.720 --> 25:58.520]  was so low that it didn't even raise the standard of the Indians.
[25:58.520 --> 26:02.880]  See, you would pay the Indians a good amount, and pay the Americans a good amount, and then
[26:02.880 --> 26:07.040]  everybody could buy services from each other, and that raises the standard.
[26:07.040 --> 26:08.320]  Ross Perot talked about this.
[26:08.320 --> 26:11.840]  This is well-known economics 101.
[26:11.840 --> 26:22.560]  Do you want economics to pay your people enough so they can buy your Ford Model T?
[26:22.560 --> 26:32.240]  That's not done now, and it's done to destroy the country, and it's that issue that I come
[26:32.240 --> 26:46.280]  to grips with, that now the illegals are here being hired, and they're replacing what's
[26:46.280 --> 26:51.760]  left of American workers, and then those people just go on the unemployment rolls or get a
[26:51.760 --> 26:56.880]  part-time job, and then you can't pay the taxes and regulations with a part-time job
[26:56.880 --> 27:05.360]  so you finally give up and go on welfare, and they've got well over 50% now on welfare.
[27:05.360 --> 27:15.080]  Over 100 million people are on welfare now, and I said that in a video last week, and
[27:15.080 --> 27:21.200]  I saw comments on the YouTube saying, you're a liar, 100 million are on welfare, so I went
[27:21.200 --> 27:27.600]  and I searched it, and there it was, 101,800 something thousand about a month ago from
[27:27.600 --> 27:38.800]  the Department of Labor and statistics saying that 100 plus million people are on welfare
[27:38.800 --> 27:47.200]  of some form or another, right at 50 million on food stamps on top of it.
[27:47.200 --> 27:52.840]  What do you do under an Agenda 21 clowered and pivot program, and we're living it, and
[27:52.840 --> 28:02.000]  it's going to destroy the country, and it's going to turn us into a third world hell pit
[28:02.000 --> 28:10.720]  with cops and black uniforms with machine guns everywhere like North Korea, and our
[28:10.720 --> 28:22.040]  government is openly arming Al Qaeda and other Bahabas out of Saudi Arabia all over the Middle
[28:22.040 --> 28:35.440]  East, set up a base on the Iraq border with Syria, and then launch this ISIS attack, launch
[28:35.440 --> 28:44.040]  this ISIS attack, launch this ISIS attack, now there's the headline, over 100 million
[28:44.040 --> 28:49.680]  now receiving federal welfare, let's scroll down, that's out of the Washington examiner,
[28:49.680 --> 28:56.440]  but the figures are out of the US Census Survey of Income Program participation, Senate Budget
[28:56.440 --> 29:05.720]  Committee, now 100 plus million, and then that's not counting the 30 million illegals,
[29:05.720 --> 29:11.240]  and then I'm sitting here knowing all the players, knowing the groups, Baghdad's about
[29:11.240 --> 29:16.160]  to fall with that $10 billion embassy, it's a giant torture control base, it's going
[29:16.160 --> 29:20.760]  to be a Saudi Arabian command base hooked into all the wireless cameras and surveillance
[29:20.760 --> 29:28.440]  grids so that Saudi Arabia through Iraq can now launch an attack on Iran, a replay of
[29:28.440 --> 29:35.080]  the Iran-Iraq war of the 80s, and our controlled corporate media knows the public so neutralized
[29:35.080 --> 29:43.880]  and brain damaged that they're telling them that Obama doesn't know what to do to fight
[29:43.880 --> 29:48.400]  Al Qaeda taking over Iraq, it's all premeditated.
[29:48.400 --> 29:59.200]  Here on the March, The Empire's on the Run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:59.200 --> 30:03.240]  Man when I get home from work, all Betty does is watch her reality TV and then she goes
[30:03.240 --> 30:07.840]  to sleep, I can take her on romantic dates, I get her flowers, you name it, she's just
[30:07.840 --> 30:09.240]  not the woman I married.
[30:09.240 --> 30:11.720]  Oh Ralph, that's just awful.
[30:11.720 --> 30:13.240]  Does this seem familiar?
[30:13.240 --> 30:16.600]  Are the honeymoon days of your relationship long gone?
[30:16.600 --> 30:23.480]  If so, consider this, the abundance of chemical additives, pesticides, BPA containers, contaminated
[30:23.480 --> 30:27.800]  tap water and other toxic substances found in our environment.
[30:27.800 --> 30:31.680]  Experts know our bodies are suffering and being thrown off balance, especially when
[30:31.680 --> 30:33.920]  it comes to your natural systems.
[30:33.920 --> 30:40.120]  Forget synthetic chemicals, superfemale vitality brings forward key herbs specifically chosen
[30:40.120 --> 30:44.040]  for women's biology without the use of phony additives.

[30:58.960 --> 31:04.360]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more
[31:04.360 --> 31:09.040]  toxic each and every day, but it's not just the air outside that's toxic, indoor air has
[31:09.040 --> 31:13.240]  been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor
[31:13.240 --> 31:14.240]  air.
[31:14.240 --> 31:18.480]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their
[31:18.480 --> 31:19.480]  homes.
[31:19.480 --> 31:23.400]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States, well over a thousand types
[31:23.400 --> 31:26.280]  of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[31:26.280 --> 31:30.440]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[31:30.440 --> 31:34.920]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing
[31:34.920 --> 31:39.920]  my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight
[31:39.920 --> 31:45.200]  back against, made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the U.S.A.
[31:45.200 --> 31:49.600]  The new infowarslife lung cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought
[31:49.600 --> 31:51.720]  with you throughout any toxic environment.

[32:07.960 --> 32:12.480]  Security analysis infowars building independent media operations.
[32:12.480 --> 32:17.440]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[32:17.440 --> 32:19.920]  Prime Directive discredit Alex Jones.
[32:19.920 --> 32:22.760]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theory.
[32:22.760 --> 32:26.080]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[32:26.080 --> 32:28.360]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[32:28.360 --> 32:29.960]  These people are assaulting us.
[32:29.960 --> 32:32.720]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[32:32.720 --> 32:34.680]  They are never going to stop.
[32:34.680 --> 32:38.720]  They are never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[32:48.720 --> 32:53.280]  You got a censor eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[32:53.280 --> 33:22.560]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[33:22.560 --> 33:44.000]  This is Alex Jones.
[33:44.000 --> 33:47.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us.
[33:47.040 --> 33:55.480]  I just talked to our three reporters and a camera person on the Texas border where buses
[33:55.480 --> 33:59.040]  are coming across without border patrol being allowed to inspect them.
[33:59.040 --> 34:07.160]  Disgouraging groups of youth from Latin America, mainly Mexico, who are then loaded on buses
[34:07.160 --> 34:14.720]  and other vans and taken to private churches and other facilities all over the country.
[34:14.720 --> 34:20.960]  The churches are premeditatedly being involved in this lawless takeover that is sanctioned
[34:20.960 --> 34:25.440]  by the government and the trafficking of the young children into the nation that Obama
[34:25.440 --> 34:27.840]  has encouraged.
[34:27.840 --> 34:31.600]  Our reporters are going to some of these churches right now, then they're going to go back and
[34:31.600 --> 34:34.440]  show more video of the illegals' disgorging.
[34:34.440 --> 34:40.980]  Now, dinosaur run media will not cover this or they call it a crisis that just happened.
[34:40.980 --> 34:42.800]  We don't know why.
[34:42.800 --> 34:45.480]  All of Latin America is in deep trouble.
[34:45.480 --> 34:47.560]  Even countries that were doing better like Brazil are.
[34:47.560 --> 34:50.160]  The Caribbean's crime rate is more than doubled.
[34:50.160 --> 34:52.280]  Just type in the search engine.
[34:52.280 --> 34:54.240]  Caribbean crime rate increases.
[34:54.240 --> 34:56.640]  It's all falling apart.
[34:56.640 --> 34:59.280]  The world is in a global depression.
[34:59.280 --> 35:04.080]  And Obama is saying if you can get here, you're legal, 30 plus thousand children a month at
[35:04.080 --> 35:11.360]  one border area of Texas alone that the border patrol is catching and then ordered to release.
[35:11.360 --> 35:16.120]  And I have the Huffington Post right here because I mentioned this earlier and the crew
[35:16.120 --> 35:17.320]  Googled it.
[35:17.320 --> 35:22.080]  Church groups ship illegals deeper into the U.S., YDHS detainment facilities, military
[35:22.080 --> 35:23.560]  bases are swamped.
[35:23.560 --> 35:26.440]  Church groups welcome illegals with open arms.
[35:26.440 --> 35:28.960]  The Tea Party's reporting on that.
[35:28.960 --> 35:34.280]  And then I have the Huffington Post article right here about a tweet put out last week.
[35:34.280 --> 35:41.640]  New annual job rating areas, babysitting, diaper changing, burrito wrapping, cleaning,
[35:41.640 --> 35:43.140]  cells.
[35:43.140 --> 35:44.140]  What's this?
[35:44.140 --> 35:46.720]  That's put out by the border patrol.
[35:46.720 --> 35:52.600]  And they responded, the Huffington Post went with this saying, you're a racist.
[35:52.600 --> 35:54.120]  Let the racism flow.
[35:54.120 --> 36:00.080]  Folks, imagine if 30 million Americans, black, white, Hispanic showed up in Mexico City or
[36:00.080 --> 36:10.480]  in Caracas or in Brasilia or in, I don't know, what's the capital of Guatemala?
[36:10.480 --> 36:11.640]  And said, hey, we're landing.
[36:11.640 --> 36:13.320]  We're here for the free stuff.
[36:13.320 --> 36:18.360]  They would laugh at you, throw you in a jail for a week, beat you up, suck 50 grand out
[36:18.360 --> 36:22.920]  of your family, or you would starve in a dirt bottom jail.
[36:22.920 --> 36:26.280]  You get caught doing one illegal thing in Mexico, being drunk driving in there and they're
[36:26.280 --> 36:29.400]  going to beat the hell out of you and suck and run a credit check on you and take your
[36:29.400 --> 36:30.400]  money.
[36:30.400 --> 36:31.800]  And that's called loving and good.
[36:31.800 --> 36:35.040]  They'll do it to white, Hispanic, black, they don't care.
[36:35.040 --> 36:38.000]  But that's okay.
[36:38.000 --> 36:40.600]  But you go to the United States and do it.
[36:40.600 --> 36:42.040]  Oh my gosh, open arms.
[36:42.040 --> 36:45.800]  This is how political correctness was designed to kill us and the country's going to collapse.
[36:45.800 --> 36:50.600]  So hey, if you don't like, you know, having a job and owning your own house and prosperity,
[36:50.600 --> 36:55.720]  you should love this because just watch, this country is going to be in total depression
[36:55.720 --> 36:58.800]  beyond what it's already in when they're done with this.
[36:58.800 --> 37:01.680]  It's a stated plan.
[37:01.680 --> 37:05.640]  And again, I am not ashamed to sit here and talk about this, but I'll say to you again,
[37:05.640 --> 37:08.960]  I don't say this because they're pushing the race.
[37:08.960 --> 37:12.480]  Their race label stuff means nothing to me.
[37:12.480 --> 37:14.760]  I could care less what color you are.
[37:14.760 --> 37:19.080]  This is a globalist program, just like I oppose the globalist turning Iraq over to al-Qaeda
[37:19.080 --> 37:22.400]  and killing every Christian they find, every Shiite they find.
[37:22.400 --> 37:24.840]  It's offensive, evil proxy civil war.
[37:24.840 --> 37:30.360]  I oppose putting actual Highling Hitler Nazis in control of Ukraine and calling it a peaceful
[37:30.360 --> 37:35.160]  revolution and calling it an elected government when it wasn't.
[37:35.160 --> 37:36.840]  I just oppose evil.
[37:36.840 --> 37:37.840]  I oppose injustice.
[37:37.840 --> 37:40.800]  It's not like I'm even some goody tissue.
[37:40.800 --> 37:42.000]  You let evil run rampant.
[37:42.000 --> 37:44.800]  It's over folks.
[37:44.800 --> 37:48.080]  Now he's going to be with us a little bit in the next hour and then he's got to go.
[37:48.080 --> 37:54.920]  Dr. Stan Monteef of radio liberty.com has been fighting tyranny for over 40 years.
[37:54.920 --> 37:55.920]  35 years.
[37:55.920 --> 38:00.560]  He was a orthopedic surgeon in Santa Cruz.
[38:00.560 --> 38:05.000]  He led a delegation of physicians to the house delegates of California Medical Association
[38:05.000 --> 38:07.120]  for 10 years.
[38:07.120 --> 38:08.520]  He's reached millions of people.
[38:08.520 --> 38:09.600]  He's a best-selling author.
[38:09.600 --> 38:14.880]  He wrote AIDS, the unnecessary epidemic and documented that it was basically a bio weapon
[38:14.880 --> 38:21.560]  pointed at minorities and he's an amazing individual and he spoke.
[38:21.560 --> 38:25.360]  We ought to find that and play it tonight interspersed with this interview.
[38:25.360 --> 38:29.760]  He spoke a few years ago when I spoke to a Pat crowd in Santa Monica.
[38:29.760 --> 38:30.760]  That was another speech I gave.
[38:30.760 --> 38:36.560]  That was in Santa Cruz there for the KSCO folks and he doesn't like to talk about it.
[38:36.560 --> 38:40.360]  But I wondered why when I heard his local radio show, when I heard him local affiliate, he's
[38:40.360 --> 38:48.680]  out in California when I heard it here in Austin, why I wasn't hearing him on the air
[38:48.680 --> 38:49.680]  anymore.
[38:49.680 --> 38:55.680]  So I made some phone calls and learned that he has a very serious form of cancer.
[38:55.680 --> 39:00.880]  I know he's 80 plus years old and nobody lives forever but I hope he can stay here a
[39:00.880 --> 39:01.880]  lot longer.
[39:01.880 --> 39:06.480]  This is a guy that's broadcast six hours a day on four different radio shows he would
[39:06.480 --> 39:14.600]  do to over 100 affiliates for decades and when we talk about the icons like Ron Paul
[39:14.600 --> 39:17.320]  and so many others that have come before us.
[39:17.320 --> 39:23.360]  The Red Beckman's, the G. Edward Griffin's, the Anthony Sutton's, there have been so
[39:23.360 --> 39:24.360]  many.
[39:24.360 --> 39:29.520]  Dr. Stan Monteef is, oh, just an incredible debt and that's why people tell me how great
[39:29.520 --> 39:33.440]  I am all day or what a wonderful job I've done.
[39:33.440 --> 39:37.680]  Again, he isn't here for credit, he doesn't want credit, he didn't want to talk about
[39:37.680 --> 39:42.440]  his illness but I want everybody to pray for Dr. Stan but also just be thankful for
[39:42.440 --> 39:48.960]  Dr. Stan Monteef because so much of what we know today is because of him and he has
[39:48.960 --> 39:53.000]  a book and film archive that he's offered for us to go into and copy.
[39:53.000 --> 39:56.560]  We haven't had the time or energy, we were out here interviewing him a few years ago.
[39:56.560 --> 40:02.360]  He had the flu and would go and lay down because we'd flown out there for about 30 minutes,
[40:02.360 --> 40:09.120]  no be sick in the bathroom, come out, do 30 minute interview, come back and do it again.
[40:09.120 --> 40:14.640]  That's the dedication of a doctor, a medical doctor like Ron Paul, like Dr. Larry McDonald.
[40:14.640 --> 40:20.620]  So many of the great super patriots have been medical doctors and we just are so thankful
[40:20.620 --> 40:25.120]  for Dr. Stan Monteef and I know today before he came on he said, I don't want to talk about
[40:25.120 --> 40:26.120]  me.
[40:26.120 --> 40:31.360]  He told the folks this morning, I don't want to talk about my illness, I want to come on
[40:31.360 --> 40:35.360]  and talk about what's happening in Iraq and what's happening here and about the big picture.
[40:35.360 --> 40:39.280]  But I talked to him before the break, I said people care about you and we need to talk
[40:39.280 --> 40:41.280]  about it and discuss it.
[40:41.280 --> 40:46.520]  So Dr. Stan Monteef, thank you so much for coming on with us, my friend and we just are
[40:46.520 --> 40:48.600]  really thankful for all you've done.
[40:48.600 --> 40:51.640]  How many years have you been fighting the New World Order?
[40:51.640 --> 40:53.640]  I know it's over 40, isn't it?
[40:53.640 --> 40:57.640]  Started in 1962, so it's been 52 years.
[40:57.640 --> 40:58.640]  52, okay.
[40:58.640 --> 41:01.600]  I was going off an old bio, so 52.
[41:01.600 --> 41:05.400]  Tell folks a little bit about yourself and then tell folks about what you're going through
[41:05.400 --> 41:06.400]  right now.
[41:06.400 --> 41:11.840]  Well basically, I've been a retired orthopedic surgeon, I do five hours to talk radio five
[41:11.840 --> 41:15.400]  days a week and what a privilege it is to get the information out.
[41:15.400 --> 41:23.960]  Now as far as my illness is concerned, I have a T-cell lymphoma, which of course I had no
[41:23.960 --> 41:27.640]  idea until suddenly the lymph nodes came up all over.
[41:27.640 --> 41:35.320]  Unfortunately, why we have here in Santa Cruz are some excellent conventional doctors
[41:35.320 --> 41:41.480]  tied in the standard and they started me on chemotherapy and all the lymph nodes are gone.
[41:41.480 --> 41:48.280]  Now I also certainly am taking the finest alternative medicine, we have several friends
[41:48.280 --> 41:53.240]  I've known for many years, one of them Dr. Roscoe Blalock, I think he's the finest alternative
[41:53.240 --> 41:59.760]  medical specialist in the country and he's outlined a program for me of alternative treatment.
[41:59.760 --> 42:06.160]  The amazing thing is about the alternative treatment is they potentiate the action of
[42:06.160 --> 42:07.160]  the chemotherapy.
[42:07.160 --> 42:13.360]  The chemotherapy just kills every cell, kills all the, every new cell that comes up, all
[42:13.360 --> 42:20.080]  the normal T-cells, all the cells in your bone marrow, they kill everything and basically
[42:20.080 --> 42:29.720]  the alternative medicine will potentiate the action of the chemotherapy and killing
[42:29.720 --> 42:32.880]  the bad things, but actually protect the good cells.
[42:32.880 --> 42:37.440]  So this is what we're doing and all in all I feel pretty good, I feel very very tired
[42:37.440 --> 42:45.880]  but my mind is working and we have six treatments, we've actually had four of them now and I'm
[42:45.880 --> 42:50.160]  going to be optimistic about it, what's going to happen, all we can do is wait and see and
[42:50.160 --> 42:55.720]  pray, it's really in God's hands, but we do come at the prayers of your listeners, Alex,
[42:55.720 --> 43:01.000]  and hope that people, if God wants me here for another three or four or five years, why
[43:01.000 --> 43:03.400]  though, we'll be here.
[43:03.400 --> 43:08.440]  I really sort of want to see what's happening because we are entering a very very difficult
[43:08.440 --> 43:13.160]  time and I'm really very very concerned about what's going on over there in the Middle
[43:13.160 --> 43:19.280]  East and let me just comment on the basically what we're seeing in the Middle East today
[43:19.280 --> 43:27.920]  over this war in Iraq is exactly what we saw during the Second World War and what am I
[43:27.920 --> 43:28.920]  talking about?
[43:28.920 --> 43:35.040]  Well basically, we are funding the Shia Moslem in Iraq, we are funding the Sunni Moslem in
[43:35.040 --> 43:41.680]  Iraq, we're funding both sides and it really doesn't make sense that you understand World
[43:41.680 --> 43:48.360]  War II and this is one of my research studies and the most frightening thing is the realization
[43:48.360 --> 43:53.000]  that we funded the Nazis all during World War II.
[43:53.000 --> 43:57.160]  Just like Anthony Sutton, the Congressional hearings confirmed what McCarthy has said,
[43:57.160 --> 44:02.520]  the Soviets were funded all along by the robber barons, even during the Vietnam War, that's
[44:02.520 --> 44:07.560]  all declassified now, our own government put Mao Zedong in to kill 80 plus million of his
[44:07.560 --> 44:12.720]  own people, it's the globalist above the nations playing them off against each other.
[44:12.720 --> 44:19.280]  Absolutely, we funded both sides during the Vietnam War but for more than that we funded
[44:19.280 --> 44:24.920]  the Nazis during the Second World War and basically the information is there, the books
[44:24.920 --> 44:30.680]  have been written by responsible people Anthony Sutton wrote about this and the time it just
[44:30.680 --> 44:35.280]  didn't make any sense but now there's a fellow named John Lawfus who's written a book called
[44:35.280 --> 44:43.600]  America's Nazi Secret and John has had a security clearance of three levels above top secret.
[44:43.600 --> 44:48.120]  That's right, he's at the highest levels of the Justice Department and in national security
[44:48.120 --> 44:53.240]  with the FBI, we've had him on the show and he's confirmed that it wasn't just a rat
[44:53.240 --> 44:58.080]  line that the Nazis were fully in a double deal with the West, well you know about the
[44:58.080 --> 45:02.600]  McCormick-Dickstein committees, they tried to overthrow the U.S. in the mid-30s but
[45:02.600 --> 45:07.880]  Smedley Butler blew the whistle on them, we almost went under not even a Nazi regime but
[45:07.880 --> 45:14.760]  under a eugenics regime funded by the globalist but then the globalist double crossed the
[45:14.760 --> 45:20.200]  Nazis themselves, that's why Hitler was on the cover of Time magazine twice as man of
[45:20.200 --> 45:21.760]  the year as a great guy.
[45:21.760 --> 45:32.400]  Well you know one of the most incredible stories is of the escape of Adolf
[45:32.400 --> 45:37.760]  Hallows in America, who believed that Adolf Hitler didn't have the bumper there in Berlin,
[45:37.760 --> 45:42.960]  I mean we've been told that for years and yet of course I've actually talked to at
[45:42.960 --> 45:48.200]  least three men who've been to South America who talked to the people who took care of
[45:48.200 --> 45:57.160]  Adolf Hitler until he died in 1965, Adolf Hitler was allowed to escape to South America,
[45:57.160 --> 46:02.360]  he had even lived there comfortably you know for a number of years for almost 20 years
[46:02.360 --> 46:07.120]  after the war ended, and the fact that they've been able to conceal that information from
[46:07.120 --> 46:12.320]  the American people is simply a reflection of the degree of control that exists over
[46:12.320 --> 46:18.640]  almost every means of dissemination of information in the United States except for alternative
[46:18.640 --> 46:21.440]  media which is what you do so well.
[46:21.440 --> 46:27.480]  I mean this is the most amazing story we have actually, several books written by people
[46:27.480 --> 46:32.720]  who have looked into this and what have written, I'm sure you know Dr. Jerome Corsi and he's
[46:32.720 --> 46:37.720]  certainly a very reliable, Harvard trained person who writes for war on that daily and
[46:37.720 --> 46:42.880]  he's written a book on Hitler's escape, there's another one called Grey Wolf, another one
[46:42.880 --> 46:49.160]  written by a fellow named Lou Wright, the Shark Hunters, and basically an office or
[46:49.160 --> 46:50.160]  escape.
[46:50.160 --> 46:55.040]  Now if that is true, that means that almost everything we have been told by the media
[46:55.040 --> 47:01.280]  through the years is a lie, and as you and I both know it is a lie, and until we get
[47:01.280 --> 47:05.560]  the American people to understand we've been lied to, and we are being lied to, nothing's
[47:05.560 --> 47:10.320]  going to change, but if we're going to turn this thing around, we're going to have to
[47:10.320 --> 47:14.480]  get people informed and then they're going to have to get involved, and one of the biggest
[47:14.480 --> 47:21.600]  problems is that Alex isn't the average individual, well he may vote or he may not vote and he's
[47:21.600 --> 47:28.200]  going to tell other people, but people have to start getting involved in the local political
[47:28.200 --> 47:32.200]  system in their communities, we're going to have to take America back from the bottom
[47:32.200 --> 47:37.840]  up because there's control from the top down, and basically the other side is working every
[47:37.840 --> 47:38.840]  day.
[47:38.840 --> 47:43.760]  Our people don't even want to spend one night a week involved, I mean I would say to every
[47:43.760 --> 47:49.400]  one of your listeners you've got to get started today, putting it at least one day a week
[47:49.400 --> 47:54.400]  in the political process locally, supporting the local politicians who are honest, getting
[47:54.400 --> 48:00.080]  rid of the local politicians who are bad, contribute your money, get the information out, start
[48:00.080 --> 48:05.920]  talking to people, and get them involved in the political process, and simply change our
[48:05.920 --> 48:11.560]  entire local structure, we need to change our voices, supervisors, like city councils,
[48:11.560 --> 48:16.680]  our school boards, and we need to start taking America back, and if we don't do it, we're
[48:16.680 --> 48:19.400]  going to lose by default.
[48:19.400 --> 48:23.040]  Well undoubtedly there wasn't for you and so many others that came before you in the
[48:23.040 --> 48:26.720]  last 52 years that you've been fighting, they would have already gotten their program through,
[48:26.720 --> 48:33.560]  but in their globalist own words, they admit they're trying to create an artificial synthetic
[48:33.560 --> 48:41.800]  reality for us, encapsulated where everything's basically like Times Square with their disinformation
[48:41.800 --> 48:47.960]  overthrowing reality so they can sell us on all the unnatural things they want to do,
[48:47.960 --> 48:53.800]  they want to play God, and when you find out that all the major things we've been told
[48:53.800 --> 49:01.760]  are a lie, and then you look at how anti-human the controllers are, you come to the realization
[49:01.760 --> 49:06.560]  that they are a cultist, and I know in your book Best Seller Brotherhood of Darkness that
[49:06.560 --> 49:12.360]  WorldNet Daily and others helped put out, that you break this down, all these different cults,
[49:12.360 --> 49:17.040]  all these different groups, skull and bones, the Illuminati, you name it, they're all really
[49:17.040 --> 49:22.840]  satellites of the same fellow traveler system, Doctor, can you speak to the Brotherhood of
[49:22.840 --> 49:24.840]  Darkness and what their goal is?
[49:24.840 --> 49:28.600]  Well basically, you know, how do you make any sense out of what's going on, people will
[49:28.600 --> 49:35.040]  always tell you the enemy's communism, and no, we find it as communism, the enemy's
[49:35.040 --> 49:41.760]  fascism, and the Nazis, and basically this is all a lie, and how do you understand what's
[49:41.760 --> 49:48.120]  going on, how do you understand the theories of wars we had, the First World War, the Second
[49:48.120 --> 49:53.120]  World War, and the coming Third World War, well you could only understand this when you
[49:53.120 --> 49:58.400]  understand that there is another force there, the people on the right think that the left
[49:58.400 --> 50:03.400]  control of me was going on, the people on the left think that the people on the right
[50:03.400 --> 50:08.360]  control it, and they're both wrong, there is this other group, and I call them the Brotherhood
[50:08.360 --> 50:15.480]  of Darkness, but they are made up basically of people of great wealth who are deeply involved
[50:15.480 --> 50:23.200]  in the occult, and they actually rely on supernatural occurrences, they actually have supernatural
[50:23.200 --> 50:31.440]  power, these people have wealth beyond comprehension of the average individual, and we talk about
[50:31.440 --> 50:36.200]  people like the Rothschilds, we talk about people like the Rockefellers, the Whitney's,
[50:36.200 --> 50:41.440]  and the dozens of people that's the person who's been named to this book, a tragedy in
[50:41.440 --> 50:43.440]  hope it has been over a long time.
[50:43.440 --> 50:47.240]  Stay there Dr. Stan Monteev, stay there my friend, we'll come back and talk about the
[50:47.240 --> 50:52.200]  top of the pyramid, who the Brotherhood of Darkness are, and what their goals are.
[50:52.200 --> 50:59.120]  I'm Alex Jones with infowars.com and prismplanet.com, check out Dr. Stan Monteev's website RadioLiberty.com.

[51:33.800 --> 51:37.440]  I'm Tisha Casada and I'm running as an independent for Congress in Colorado.
[51:37.440 --> 51:42.000]  I fight to end the military police state ban GMO toxic foods and abolish legal tender

[51:56.440 --> 52:01.560]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[52:01.560 --> 52:07.000]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at MyPatriots supply.
[52:07.000 --> 52:10.240]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment, frustrated with the
[52:10.240 --> 52:14.160]  direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick
[52:14.160 --> 52:15.160]  buck.
[52:15.160 --> 52:19.200]  Deciding to take action, a company run by patriots for patriots was born.
[52:19.200 --> 52:23.200]  MyPatriots supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[52:23.200 --> 52:28.400]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard working American men
[52:28.400 --> 52:29.400]  and women.
[52:29.400 --> 52:33.720]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach and that's why I stock my
[52:33.720 --> 52:37.600]  pantry with high quality storeable foods from MyPatriots supply.
[52:37.600 --> 52:43.360]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com slash Alex today for special offers on emergency food storage

[54:01.880 --> 54:08.440]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[54:08.440 --> 54:23.840]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[54:23.840 --> 54:30.960]  You can look it up, 36,000 high level Nazis in every field of science and politics were
[54:30.960 --> 54:39.640]  brought here and put in charge of the entire bureaucracy in the 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s.
[54:39.640 --> 54:42.720]  Anyone who's a graduate student of that age will tell you they were taught by a Nazi
[54:42.720 --> 54:44.560]  and probably half of the departments.
[54:44.560 --> 54:50.240]  It wasn't just NASA, it wasn't just economics, the CIA, had Klaus Barbie and all of them
[54:50.240 --> 54:51.840]  brought in top Nazis.
[54:51.840 --> 54:57.480]  I mean my grandfather used to be a leasehound for oil companies out in West Texas, New Mexico
[54:57.480 --> 55:03.640]  and the Nazis would live on the basis and, you know, they'd be at the bars, the only
[55:03.640 --> 55:07.080]  place to get a chicken fried steak and some of the guys, sometimes the Germans would get
[55:07.080 --> 55:10.860]  smart mouth about, oh, we would have kicked your ass, blah, blah, and there'd be fist
[55:10.860 --> 55:14.640]  fights and things and I remember him just barely mentioning people getting in fights
[55:14.640 --> 55:17.920]  with them and stuff and I was a little kid and you hear your grandpa talking about this
[55:17.920 --> 55:21.680]  kind of stuff and you don't believe, it just sounds crazy.
[55:21.680 --> 55:25.040]  And now they brought in, you know, all these other globalists, they brought in the former
[55:25.040 --> 55:29.640]  East Germans to set up Homeland Security and it just shows how evil the people are that
[55:29.640 --> 55:30.640]  are running things.
[55:30.640 --> 55:33.120]  So Dr. Stan Monteef was bringing that up.
[55:33.120 --> 55:39.520]  You were getting into the brotherhood of darkness though, it just, it's all about betrayal
[55:39.520 --> 55:43.400]  and it's always about betraying the last group they funded for the next group, it's full
[55:43.400 --> 55:48.840]  spectrum dominance, it's control both sides of the chessboard, that way you own the board
[55:48.840 --> 55:54.120]  itself and the public's always opting in to the construct you've given them, but at
[55:54.120 --> 56:00.040]  the top of the pyramid, Dr. Stan Monteef, icon of the Awakening Liberty Movement, what
[56:00.040 --> 56:03.640]  is at the top of the pyramid, what is their in-game goal if they succeed?
[56:03.640 --> 56:09.520]  Well, basically what is so difficult for most people to believe is that there really is
[56:09.520 --> 56:12.400]  a supernatural component to life.
[56:12.400 --> 56:18.640]  I mean, how we live, we were born and just go to the life, we die, how about if there
[56:18.640 --> 56:25.520]  is so much more to life than simply that, there really is a God, there really are supernatural
[56:25.520 --> 56:31.800]  forces and once you have a personal relationship with our Lord, or you'll see Him in the bearing
[56:31.800 --> 56:38.960]  and in the interjection, Him in your life almost on a daily basis, it's almost impossible
[56:38.960 --> 56:45.560]  to believe, but I'm sure that you and other people who are Christians, I see that influence
[56:45.560 --> 56:46.560]  of God.
[56:46.560 --> 56:53.040]  I've experienced so much providence and then I feel ashamed that I'm given this many chances
[56:53.040 --> 56:54.040]  and this much providence.
[56:54.040 --> 56:55.760]  I mean, is that what it feels like for you?
[56:55.760 --> 56:56.760]  Amen to that.
[56:56.760 --> 57:01.600]  But God is guiding us and there's a small number of us who are out there in the front
[57:01.600 --> 57:07.200]  line of this battle being protected and getting the word out and I'm just hoping and praying
[57:07.200 --> 57:12.320]  that more and more people will turn to God and get involved in this.
[57:12.320 --> 57:17.520]  We're not going to be able to defeat all these wicked people on our own, only God's help
[57:17.520 --> 57:18.520]  we can.
[57:18.520 --> 57:23.760]  We're involved in this spiritual battle that's being taught on a political, ideological and
[57:23.760 --> 57:29.680]  cultural battlefield, but it is really a spiritual battle and we need God's help and
[57:29.680 --> 57:35.840]  God will help us if we ask for it, but unfortunately, America as a nation has rejected God.
[57:35.840 --> 57:41.320]  We are opposed to nations and I really fear that God is going to bring His judgment on
[57:41.320 --> 57:42.320]  this nation.
[57:42.320 --> 57:46.320]  I think that's the biggest thing that we have to look forward to now.
[57:46.320 --> 57:50.960]  In fact, there's one thing that Thomas Jefferson said I will never forget.
[57:50.960 --> 57:53.320]  God who gave his life, gave his liberty.
[57:53.320 --> 57:58.120]  But can the liberty of a nation be secure when the conviction has been forgotten?
[57:58.120 --> 58:00.640]  That liberty is the gift of God.
[58:00.640 --> 58:08.080]  I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just and is just as will not be forever.
[58:08.080 --> 58:12.320]  And I really fear God is going to bring His judgment on this country unless there is a
[58:12.320 --> 58:13.320]  massive revival.
[58:13.320 --> 58:17.720]  I don't see it coming, but my job is to do what I do.
[58:17.720 --> 58:18.720]  Well, stay there.
[58:18.720 --> 58:21.520]  We're going to come back, sir, with five more minutes with you and then I want to get you
[58:21.520 --> 58:25.880]  back as soon as possible, Dr. Sam Monteef, but here's the issue.
[58:25.880 --> 58:29.640]  In my gut, I feel the hedge of protection is being removed.
[58:29.640 --> 58:31.400]  That's the dread I feel.
[58:31.400 --> 58:32.800]  We see everything accelerating.
[58:32.800 --> 58:34.600]  I want to ask you where that's all going.
[58:34.600 --> 58:39.880]  Then we're going to the border to talk to our reporters.
[58:39.880 --> 58:43.200]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[58:43.200 --> 58:49.280]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:49.280 --> 58:52.040]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[58:52.040 --> 58:57.560]  Supermale vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead
[58:57.560 --> 59:03.160]  of using synthetic chemicals sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the
[59:03.160 --> 59:07.040]  planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[59:07.040 --> 59:11.760]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago and I must say that was good stuff.
[59:11.760 --> 59:16.120]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed
[59:16.120 --> 59:22.600]  what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[59:22.600 --> 59:28.200]  Super male vitality by InfoWarsLife is so powerful that I only take half the recommended
[59:28.200 --> 59:29.200]  dose.
[59:29.200 --> 59:31.320]  I jump out of the bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[59:31.320 --> 59:35.240]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality and get the day started.
[59:35.240 --> 59:37.240]  It's not just the super male vitality.
[59:37.240 --> 59:41.480]  All the products in InfoWarsLife.com are simply amazing.
[59:41.480 --> 59:47.360]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products
[59:47.360 --> 59:52.320]  from InfoWarsLife.
[59:52.320 --> 01:00:05.440]  Raging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:10.200]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:11.200]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:13.360]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:17.520]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:24.760]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:29.200]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour, we're going to have our reporters from the border.
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:35.440]  In the video and the photos they took are being picked up by DrudgeReport.com, Tea Party
[01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:37.320]  websites, all of it.
[01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:42.120]  It's the illegals getting off buses, being loaded on church vans and being shipped out.
[01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:43.280]  That's coming up.
[01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:49.360]  Also, hundreds of thousands being taken captive, massive executions in horror.
[01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:54.240]  As the Saudi Arabian funded Al Qaeda forces, Drudge has it from the Daily Mail.
[01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:56.040]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:00:56.040 --> 01:01:00.960]  Engaging the executions of Christians in mass, in mass graves.
[01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:03.560]  This is just incredible.
[01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:04.560]  This is just amazing.
[01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:07.960]  We're going to cover all that coming up in the next segment.
[01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:12.160]  Dr. Stan Monteef, what I was saying before we went to break is, evil's moving on every
[01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:13.760]  front right now.
[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:16.080]  I can see that the hammer's dropping.
[01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:18.280]  I mean, A, do you concur with that?
[01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:19.600]  Do you feel it in your spirit?
[01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:20.600]  And where do you see everything going?
[01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:22.600]  I think that we are in real trouble.
[01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:27.720]  I think America's turned against God, and I believe God is going to bring his judgment.
[01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:31.720]  And last, as I mentioned earlier, we have a massive revival.
[01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:37.800]  I don't see it coming, but my job, your job, the small group of people that alternative
[01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:40.800]  radio are having an impact.
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:43.720]  And I will tell you the other side is worried.
[01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:50.000]  I saw this, I didn't notice it the other day, there was an article in one of the magazines
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:55.000]  criticizing these crazy people who did the conspiracy, but it said that there are almost
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:00.800]  23% of the population really believes there is a conspiracy.
[01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:04.840]  Well, I think that's pretty good, and I think we're making progress, Alex.
[01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:10.640]  All we can do is keep pushing, but also pointing to this is not simply an ideological battle
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:17.440]  it's a spiritual battle, and try to get people to begin looking to our Lord for salvation
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:21.440]  and basically for strength, because that's where our strength is going to come from.
[01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:25.920]  And if we're going to turn this thing around, it's going to be with God's help, not simply
[01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:29.280]  on our own efforts.
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:36.200]  I'm showing images of the Al-Qaeda troops that have taken over the ISIS forces, and
[01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:39.880]  they are just showing the mass graves, the mass executions.
[01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:43.800]  There's even gruesome video of it, I don't know if we're going to show that, but I mean,
[01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:45.920]  this is just wholesale evil.
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:49.600]  Every Christian they find is killed, every policeman they find is killed.
[01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:54.920]  This is who our government put in, and is now funding the destruction of the very same
[01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:58.000]  moderates that were put in compared to these people.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:03.440]  This is unspeakable evil that's being committed right now, and it just shows the plan they
[01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:05.000]  have for us here as well.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:09.960]  They're funding both sides, that's what most people must understand, we are funding the
[01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:14.160]  shias, we're funding the Sunnis, and we should pull out of there completely, and we should
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:15.160]  demand immediately.
[01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:22.200]  In fact, I said to me yesterday for the first time, actually contact my congressman and both
[01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:29.680]  my senators and said, pull out, pull out immediately, and I would suggest that we ask your listeners
[01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:38.600]  to send an email immediately to their congressman and both senators saying pull out, if there
[01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:45.440]  was enough of a support across America, we could bring pressure on Obama, and he would
[01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:46.440]  begin to back down.
[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:50.520]  Sure, sure, here's my issue, and I want to have you back up so you can talk about it.
[01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:56.280]  I was against going there both times because it was a setup, and I know you were as well.
[01:03:56.280 --> 01:04:03.440]  The problem is Saudi Arabia and NATO are behind this ISIS takeover.
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:07.800]  You've got highways for 20 miles full of the Al-Qaeda forces, they could highway of death
[01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:13.320]  them and destroy them, but Obama acts like he's just fumbling around doing nothing.
[01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:17.760]  Don't we have a responsibility if we toppled the government to not let Al-Qaeda take over?
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:27.080]  I think this is a civil war, just pull everything out, get out of there completely, and let
[01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:28.080]  them solve it.
[01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:32.880]  It's going to be a bloodbath no matter what happens, but we should not be back there.
[01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:38.000]  I agree with you, but that was back in 1990, don't let them do this or let them have a
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.000]  civil war.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:44.280]  Now, what I'm saying is the globalists are the ones, this is the same Al-Qaeda group
[01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:46.880]  they had attacking Syria, now they've gone into Iraq.
[01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:50.680]  Dr. Scanmont T, we're all praying for you brother, get better, I want to have you back
[01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:55.200]  up soon, Godspeed at Radio Liberty, we all owe you a debt, and say hi to your wife and
[01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:57.080]  family for you, God bless you.
[01:04:57.080 --> 01:04:59.040]  God bless and thanks to my teller, bye bye.
[01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:03.160]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:07.600]  This year alone over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:11.200]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:14.160]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:18.080]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect
[01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:21.800]  you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:25.760]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:30.280]  Few filters cut out the glyphosates that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:35.680]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosalic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:40.000]  All right, it is intense and coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:44.280]  It is our responsibility to protect our families, the establishment's not going to do it.
[01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:49.600]  It's time to take action, it's time to filter our water, visit infowarsthor.com and use

[01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:04.400]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with
[01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:09.720]  the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:11.760]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:12.760]  Fluoride.
[01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:14.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:20.240]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add
[01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:21.240]  iodine.
[01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:26.440]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table and the results are on record.
[01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:31.680]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient
[01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:32.680]  in iodine.
[01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:34.920]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:41.400]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base, nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:46.880]  You will find Survival Shield nascent iodine exclusively at infowarslife.com.
[01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:51.720]  Infowars life, Survival Shield nascent iodine isn't just for emergencies.
[01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:59.080]  I take it every day, that's infowarslife.com or call toll free, 888-253-3139.
[01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:04.200]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more
[01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:08.600]  and more toxic each and every day, but it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:12.600]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants
[01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:17.440]  than even outdoor air, and most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic
[01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:19.000]  chemicals within their homes.
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:22.400]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:26.920]  Well over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions, and don't forget
[01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:30.520]  the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:35.000]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:40.040]  my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight
[01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:41.040]  back against.
[01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:45.320]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the U.S.A.
[01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:49.720]  The new Infowars Life Lung Cleans is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought
[01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:51.840]  with you throughout any toxic environment.
[01:07:51.840 --> 01:08:00.440]  Now available exclusively at infowarslife.com or by calling toll free, 888-253-3139.
[01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:06.360]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show because there's
[01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:31.080]  a war on for your mind.
[01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:39.080]  Our story concerning the Texas border and Greyhound buses that are coming across without
[01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:46.440]  the Border Patrol even checking them, disgorging illegal alien teenagers but also young adults
[01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:55.400]  with children who are being loaded on vans and taken to facilities all over the country.
[01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:58.440]  I mean this is the end of law and order, the end of the border.
[01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:01.280]  And a lot of libertarians will say whoopee, that's great.
[01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:04.040]  That's not libertarianism.
[01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:06.440]  Mexico doesn't reciprocate.
[01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:08.680]  You can't go to Mexico and have your baby paid for.
[01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:13.140]  You can't go to Mexico and get free in state tuition.
[01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:15.080]  You can't go to Guatemala and get that.
[01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:17.200]  You can't go to Nigeria and get that.
[01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:20.080]  Folks, I think you should really visit Mexico City.
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:21.600]  I've been there.
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:24.440]  I think you should visit Guatemala City.
[01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:26.600]  I think you should visit Nigeria.
[01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:28.760]  I think you should visit Roatan.
[01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:30.760]  I think you should visit Honduras.
[01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:33.880]  I think you should see it for yourself.
[01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:37.000]  There's seven billion people want to come in this country.
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:41.040]  And Obama is saying if you can get here, you're legal.
[01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:47.080]  And we have the bombshell video up on infowars.com that's gone viral via drugsreport.com and a
[01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:48.080]  bunch of other sites.
[01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:53.880]  Fox News last week and this week has been picking up our videos that we get at the immigration
[01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:57.560]  facilities and military bases that no one else is getting other than Reitbart.
[01:09:57.560 --> 01:09:58.880]  They're getting stuff in Houston.
[01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:02.320]  We got incredible video in San Antonio.
[01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:05.200]  Now video down in Brownsville and other areas.
[01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:06.200]  They're in McCallum.
[01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:11.320]  A reporter is going to be there for a couple of days, Jakari Jackson and others.
[01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:20.560]  And it is showing teenagers loaded off buses at the border not being searched.
[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:30.160]  And the border patrol is on record saying they've been ordered to stand down.
[01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:35.440]  This is what's happening in America.
[01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:40.160]  This is what's happening at the Greyhound bus terminals.
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:42.640]  This is the end of the country as we know it.
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:46.720]  And again, if these were skilled workers from Mexico, we're going to come up here and demand
[01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:53.880]  good wages and who we could get to vote for the Second Amendment.
[01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:56.760]  It actually wouldn't be bad for our economy.
[01:10:56.760 --> 01:10:58.960]  This is totally unskilled.
[01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:01.880]  This is people that are going to be a total draw on the system.
[01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:06.080]  And that's what it's designed to do under Cloward Piven, the Democratic Party plan to
[01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:15.200]  bank, rub the social services and bring in total control to bank, rub the free market.
[01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:24.680]  And it is just incredible to see the buses arriving from all over Mexico for the illegals
[01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:28.080]  to just be legalized en masse.
[01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:34.600]  And then to politically come in and be organized into anti-American brigades, which is what
[01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:35.600]  the Democrats are doing.
[01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:38.440]  I mean, they're allowed to call Mecha and La Raza.
[01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:40.360]  Well, La Raza means the race.
[01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:42.600]  And the motto is for those inside the race, everything.
[01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:47.400]  For those outside the race, nothing.
[01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:52.120]  It's so over the top, and it's just going to get worse.
[01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:55.680]  Like, it's racist if you don't have 100% taxes on you.
[01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:58.000]  It's racist if you don't house illegals in your house.
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.120]  Well, they're people, too.
[01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:03.160]  But then when they take your house because you didn't pay the property taxes, nobody's
[01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:04.400]  going to cry for you.
[01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:08.920]  When the cops write you five tickets, even though you can't pay for your kids' lunches,
[01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:16.760]  it doesn't matter, your car's out of inspection, your tires aren't good, your license plates
[01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:18.960]  out here, I'm going to write you four or five tickets.
[01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:20.360]  But sir, I'm bankrupt.
[01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:23.160]  Tell it to the judge, lady.
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:27.840]  Bankrupt America Bottom Line.
[01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:29.440]  This is a revolution against this country.
[01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:34.040]  I want to hear from listeners out there on this subject, ahead of our reporters, who
[01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:37.400]  are going to be doing a live shot anywhere they go.
[01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:40.280]  There's just bus terminals and vans they were telling us.
[01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:45.000]  Any town you go to, just arriving, just illegals, just everywhere, massing, and being bussed
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.000]  all over the country.
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:51.000]  It is like a D-Day military invasion.
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:55.760]  A La Infasora.
[01:12:55.760 --> 01:12:58.680]  You see that on the billboards for Mexican radio stations.
[01:12:58.680 --> 01:12:59.680]  La Infasora.
[01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:05.680]  Not even I, La Infasora.
[01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:10.800]  And then you can look at the billboards called La Reconquista, and again, it's organized
[01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:11.800]  by government.
[01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:16.560]  Remember, who's the, he's a white guy, he's the biggest owner of Spanish TV stations in
[01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:17.560]  the country.
[01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:21.080]  Came out a few years ago, got picked up by NBC, Drudge picked it up, I remember showing
[01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:27.160]  it, where they did billboards saying Los Angeles and crossing it out, Los Angeles, USA, and
[01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:30.000]  saying Mexico.
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:36.160]  So playing into that as a sense of national pride, but you can't serve peanut butter and
[01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:40.520]  jelly sandwiches at the school cafeteria because that's racist.
[01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:44.400]  Or you can't dress up like a Native American for Halloween because that's racist.
[01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:47.680]  And you can't say the word bossy because it's anti-feminist.
[01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:52.720]  Like everything's racist or anti-woman.
[01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:57.480]  Just total political correctness, everyone paralyzed, and then the illegals can say down
[01:13:57.480 --> 01:14:03.720]  with the US, you know, this is Mexico, and I have footage of the immigration demonstrations
[01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:09.160]  here in Austin with folks hoisting their kids up going, Mexico, Mexico, Mexico, it's in
[01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:13.080]  my film Battle for the Republic.
[01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:18.880]  And it'd be one thing if Switzerland bordered us, and let's say the Swiss had brown skin,
[01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:23.960]  and they were like invading with billions of dollars and invading with the Second Amendment
[01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:28.480]  and invading with, you know, prosperity, I'd be like, man, I mean, let me, let me tell
[01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:29.480]  you something.
[01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:30.480]  Mexico is a beautiful country.
[01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:36.080]  If Mexico was like Switzerland, I mean, it was all brown people, but it was free, and
[01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:37.080]  it was safe at night.
[01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:38.080]  You could have guns.
[01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:39.080]  I would move there.
[01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:40.080]  Okay.
[01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:42.160]  I'm not a move there when I was 20 and married a senior Rita.
[01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:46.040]  But let me tell you something, folks, it isn't with the people the way they look.
[01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:51.040]  I don't like it's that it's a failed, collapsed country.
[01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:56.200]  I mean, why do you think everybody wants to get out of Mexico and get up here?
[01:14:56.200 --> 01:15:02.360]  But then it's like, as soon as you get here, then there you go.
[01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:05.960]  Liberation Theology funded by the Ford Foundation.
[01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:10.040]  And I won some art awards when I was in high school and in community college.
[01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:14.400]  Yeah, they put them in state shows and things.
[01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:21.360]  And I sold some paintings early on, I would have been a successful artist, well, I'd
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:24.320]  be a lot more relaxing.
[01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:27.360]  And they said, we want to take you to the University of Texas for a special event this
[01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:28.360]  week.
[01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:29.360]  You'll be out of school three days this week.
[01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:34.760]  And they took me in there senior in high school here in Austin.
[01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:39.200]  And it was all a UT project talking about how bad America was and how evil America was
[01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:44.520]  and how great the plan of San Diego was and all this, and I knew enough about it.
[01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:46.560]  I was like, what is this?
[01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:48.760]  And I was like, this is like some kind of indoctrination.
[01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:51.000]  And they were like, whoa, who is this guy?
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:52.000]  How does he know this?
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:56.600]  And they were all freaked out by it was a big deal.
[01:15:56.600 --> 01:16:03.920]  Because the other young people did not have any idea that they were promoting the plan
[01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:09.240]  to kill all Anglo men 16 and above.
[01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:12.120]  And then we went out to a rally a few years ago, I have video of this.
[01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:16.720]  It was a bunch of the illegals, but also their handlers here, who it turns out in a lot of
[01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:19.680]  cases get caught beating them and keeping them as slaves.
[01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:23.680]  The truth is, it's just like with the black community, you've got a rich black contingent
[01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:28.040]  that Chappelle and others have talked about that manage and control all the other blacks.
[01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:31.840]  You're always hearing about the immigration leaders in Austin caught beating people at
[01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:37.800]  baseball bats and basements and basically using them as slave labor and their coyotes, folks.
[01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:42.920]  They're running this giant mass of poor desperate people from Mexico through their system feeding
[01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:46.880]  on them and acting like they care about them all day.
[01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:50.360]  It's totally evil.
[01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:54.160]  And you'll never hear out of these leftist groups, hey, don't take the Gardasil shot.
[01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:57.080]  Hey, don't abort your baby.
[01:16:57.080 --> 01:16:59.680]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:03.840]  Get up here to America, because again, American citizens are born in Mexico.
[01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:07.440]  If you're Hispanic here, you're supposed to abort your baby.
[01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:12.400]  So they got black liberation theology, liberation theology is what Obama teaches.
[01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:18.480]  It's social Christianity and that's what they taught in Mexico so that we couldn't be friends
[01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:23.440]  and so we couldn't work together and it's a shame.
[01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:29.120]  So that's all coming up with the guys as soon as they're able to connect at about 40 after.
[01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:34.840]  I want to hear from you, though, on the big story.
[01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:39.120]  Kurt Nemo did an article about this, ISIS and the plan to vulcanize the Middle East,
[01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:46.280]  CIA's, Benghazi weapons used by ISIS to conquest of Iraq and Kurt Nemo links to the big think
[01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:51.600]  tank statements admitting that Saudi Arabia is funding this through NATO and the proxy
[01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:55.280]  armies and so is the Belfast Times.
[01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:57.640]  By the way, this is all admitted.
[01:17:57.640 --> 01:18:04.120]  Saudi Arabia, Sunni Caliphate, NATO, Run Secret Terror Army in Iraq and Syria, another Kurt
[01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:07.840]  Nemo, Alex Jones article.
[01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:12.040]  And folks, this is the model, total chaos.
[01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:15.440]  You had the Shiites and the Sunnis living in peace now.
[01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:20.080]  First Saddam's put him by the CIA to launch a war against Iran.
[01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:22.680]  He fails against that after eight years.
[01:18:22.680 --> 01:18:24.080]  They tell him, go ahead and invade Kuwait.
[01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:25.080]  He does.
[01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:26.080]  They set him up.
[01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:27.080]  They go in.
[01:18:27.080 --> 01:18:30.520]  They take an Iraq with inspectors to destroy all their weapons to defend themselves, not
[01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:33.800]  endorsing Saddam's, giving the facts for over a decade.
[01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:39.120]  Over a million Iraqis die in sanctions, then another million die from 2003 and the new invasion
[01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:44.040]  up until just last year, 1.3 million lands at medical journal.
[01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:47.400]  Then they're totally weak on their knees, a coalition government.
[01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:55.800]  Then they use the bases on the border with Iraq and Syria with al-Qaeda to then reinvade
[01:18:55.800 --> 01:19:00.760]  and, you know, you heard about the Iraqi government fighting al-Qaeda in Tikrit in
[01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:04.920]  Fallujah and begging the U.S. for help two months ago.
[01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:07.360]  Help never came.
[01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:12.600]  Saudi Arabia poured in two weeks ago and it's now about to enter Baghdad has taken the suburbs.
[01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:13.600]  The military is collapsing.
[01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:18.240]  They're going to get the $10 million command base and use that as a Saudi Arabian command
[01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:25.520]  base to take over all of Iraq with the CIA and globalist aiding them and starting a new
[01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:27.720]  operation against Iran.
[01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:31.840]  And again, I'm not on Saudi Arabia's side, I'm not on Iran's side, I'm on other sides.
[01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:39.560]  The globalists are accentuating a civil war and it's totally immoral while using the threat
[01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:43.000]  of al-Qaeda to take our liberties here in America.
[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:47.000]  And now Lindsey Graham says, give up all your rights, al-Qaeda's got a base in Iraq.
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:51.320]  When he knows full well that's what Benghazi was about, was getting those weapons and other
[01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:53.320]  systems to him.
[01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:59.320]  This is it folks, Saudi Arabia is taking over with globalist backing.
[01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:04.320]  How long would you last if all grocery stores ceased to exist?
[01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:06.320]  Not in America, this can't happen in America.
[01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:10.840]  Because I'm not concerned about our government, I was looking at survival stuff.
[01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:14.560]  I was raised as a Girl Scout and it's marvelous to be prepared.
[01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:19.560]  Food for patriots was an opportunity for me to be able to put some things aside.
[01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:24.280]  I said, well this is a product worth having, being as it's so good.
[01:20:24.280 --> 01:20:28.720]  Like the pricing for what I got, I like the containers they were shipped in.
[01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:32.720]  If they keep in touch with you, you get your emails, you get your confirmation.
[01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:37.000]  Customer service is just absolutely fantastic.
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:40.560]  Plan on buying probably about four more of these minimum.
[01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:43.720]  And this came so quick, it came right when they said it was top.
[01:20:43.720 --> 01:20:47.480]  Thanks for supplying all this stuff for us, because I think we're all going to be needing
[01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:49.120]  it in a very short time.

[01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:01.240]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:06.720]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:10.040]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment, frustrated with the
[01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:11.720]  direction this country was headed.
[01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:15.000]  And the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:19.120]  Deciding to take action, a company run by patriots for patriots was born.
[01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:23.120]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:28.400]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hardworking American men
[01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:29.400]  and women.
[01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:32.280]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.

[01:23:56.720 --> 01:24:14.720]  Everybody knows, everybody knows that the days are loaded, everybody rolls with their
[01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:25.720]  fingers crossed, everybody knows the war is over, everybody knows that good guys lost,
[01:24:25.720 --> 01:24:35.880]  everybody knows the fight was fixed, the poor stay poor, the rich get rich, that's how it
[01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:42.080]  goes, everybody knows, everybody knows.
[01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:48.280]  The reason the West has produced so much wealth and power is we have all the evil human traits
[01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:49.480]  but also the good ones.
[01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:58.120]  But there was a fighting spirit of not giving up so that meant tyrants got overthrown a lot.
[01:24:58.120 --> 01:25:04.600]  Other parts of the world I've studied in depth tended to settle into long-term tyrannies
[01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:10.800]  and that's an over-generalization and societies are all basically identical, long-term looking
[01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:19.120]  at them, humans act the same but our world, our country is going into a mega-tyranium.
[01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:24.520]  I've studied how history works, I know you have as well and it's repeating itself right
[01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:26.640]  now.
[01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:34.680]  Notice things just get more frantic, more insane, more out of control by the hour and
[01:25:34.680 --> 01:25:40.640]  the statistics show it and now the globalists are running proxy wars all over the world
[01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:43.720]  using destabilization as ways to take over.
[01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:49.600]  Think about Methodist churches, Baptist churches, Catholic churches, you name it, are on television
[01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:56.520]  saying legalize all immigrants, no borders now.
[01:25:56.520 --> 01:26:00.960]  Mexico is a completely collapsed failed state, can you imagine if the 100 plus million people
[01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:04.840]  that are already down there, not just the 30 million that have come up here plus just
[01:26:04.840 --> 01:26:11.320]  came across and got on welfare, we'd bankrupt today and that's the plan.
[01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:17.400]  Can you imagine if anybody from India or Eastern Europe or anywhere could just come here and
[01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:19.400]  then get freebies, what would happen?
[01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:23.000]  Well see the globalists don't intend for that to happen, they're just going to get
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:28.560]  enough here to politically balkanize the country and have folks that'll vote to radically
[01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:32.760]  destroy the Bill of Rights of Constitution and we're almost there.
[01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:38.520]  And these are political Democratic Party voters being organized by these church groups on record,
[01:26:38.520 --> 01:26:42.120]  they're on NPR, they're everywhere, they're in an article, video of them loading up the
[01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:49.400]  illegals, trafficking them into the country.
[01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:56.360]  This is a revolution and then meanwhile all over the world in Africa and in the Middle
[01:26:56.360 --> 01:27:03.480]  East, you name it, they are funding Muslim groups to kill Christians in mass, they are
[01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:06.960]  lining up Christians, this can be by the hundreds of thousands when it's all said
[01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:09.200]  and done, maybe millions.
[01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:12.800]  Iraq is one of the biggest minority Christian groups left in the Middle East and they are
[01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:16.120]  exterminating them in mass right now.
[01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:23.000]  On record, Al Qaeda funded by our government and our media goes, okay it's a civil war,
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:28.080]  sure we fund both sides, they're not funding both sides, they couldn't just kick Saddam
[01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:32.880]  out and then put Al Qaeda in, that would have been too obvious.
[01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:38.920]  They waited a while and now they're putting them in.
[01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:50.640]  I want to hear from you on this, 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231, talk to JJ, Mark and others,
[01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:59.000]  but this ISIS fly Al Qaeda, Saudi Arabia and Wahhabist flags, that's what they are, you
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:03.600]  can look up the flag of Al Qaeda, it's what they fly.
[01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:08.240]  And there's a disinformation campaign on InfoWars.com and YouTube going, this hidden Al Qaeda, these
[01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:16.000]  people fired Al Qaeda, Iran's with Al Qaeda and I saw Fox News in the last break, I was
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:24.560]  in there, Fox News in the break room with an analyst saying Iran's really with Al Qaeda.
[01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:30.760]  I'm not romanticizing Iran, they've got real terrorists, they do stuff, but that's Hezbollah
[01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:40.880]  and Al Qaeda has nothing to do with Iran and everything to do with Saudi Arabia, that's
[01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:42.480]  on record.
[01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:48.600]  Saudi Arabia and Iran are arch enemies, Saudi Arabia's been getting nuclear weapons now last
[01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:51.440]  year threatening to attack Iran.
[01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:59.120]  They hate each other, Mecca is in Saudi Arabia, Islam started in Saudi Arabia and the Sunnis
[01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:06.760]  are the big inclusive group, everybody can be a religious leader if you are a Sunni,
[01:29:06.760 --> 01:29:10.760]  you have to trace your lineage to Muhammad if you're a Shiite.
[01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:15.280]  It's more inclusive, more elitist, so it didn't take over Islam, even though it's probably
[01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:20.280]  older than the Sunnis, because obviously Muhammad's family said, oh no, you got to be one of us,
[01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:22.120]  that was a new form of royalty.
[01:29:22.120 --> 01:29:28.000]  I'm out here attacking the Shiites, it's just that, I'm just telling you the different
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:34.000]  players here, Saudi Arabia wants to take over, Saudi Arabia is western backed, Saudi Arabia
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:41.800]  is where 15 to the 19 hijackers are from, why are we attacking Iraq, why are they not
[01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:48.440]  bombing like the highway of death, the Al Qaeda forces that are pouring into Iraq.
[01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:55.440]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:30:59.280 --> 01:31:04.160]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding,
[01:31:04.160 --> 01:31:07.400]  making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[01:31:07.400 --> 01:31:09.680]  All the major networks are state run.
[01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:12.320]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[01:31:12.320 --> 01:31:16.640]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment and pushes Obamacare.
[01:31:16.640 --> 01:31:19.920]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:24.280]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids
[01:31:24.280 --> 01:31:27.400]  belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[01:31:27.400 --> 01:31:31.720]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[01:31:31.720 --> 01:31:33.520]  We are the true media.
[01:31:33.520 --> 01:31:36.240]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:40.200]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war.

[01:31:57.760 --> 01:32:03.280]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[01:32:03.280 --> 01:32:07.680]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[01:32:07.680 --> 01:32:11.280]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[01:32:11.280 --> 01:32:14.680]  It is forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[01:32:14.680 --> 01:32:18.160]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect
[01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:21.840]  you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[01:32:21.840 --> 01:32:25.800]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[01:32:25.800 --> 01:32:30.360]  Few filters cut out the glyphosates that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[01:32:30.360 --> 01:32:35.600]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosalic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:40.120]  All right, it is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in breads, it's in toothpaste.
[01:32:40.120 --> 01:32:42.840]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[01:32:42.840 --> 01:32:44.360]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[01:32:44.360 --> 01:32:47.520]  It's time to take action, it's time to filter our water.

[01:33:11.520 --> 01:33:20.520]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:20.520 --> 01:33:38.440]  I just want to say something here, the Info Wars crew is doing an amazing job.
[01:33:38.440 --> 01:33:43.400]  Our reporters volunteer without me even asking to go to the border this weekend because of
[01:33:43.400 --> 01:33:46.560]  the fact that we have reports they're collapsing the border completely.
[01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:51.120]  The border patrol has been ordered to stand down, indeed.
[01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:56.720]  We are now about to speak to ICE and border patrol agents who are about to break gag orders
[01:33:56.720 --> 01:33:57.720]  and go public.
[01:33:57.720 --> 01:34:01.880]  In fact, they're so angry, they're ready to use their full names, but I think we're
[01:34:01.880 --> 01:34:04.960]  going to withhold that for their own safety.
[01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:09.280]  That's how upset the border patrol is, ladies and gentlemen, right now, because every country
[01:34:09.280 --> 01:34:11.000]  in the world has a border patrol.
[01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:15.160]  The U.S. is one of the most open borders in the world, the most liberal free handouts
[01:34:15.160 --> 01:34:17.960]  of any country.
[01:34:17.960 --> 01:34:24.400]  Biden is down in Central America right now to promote the illegal immigrant wave.
[01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:30.200]  To actually say, come on, as part of Battleground, Texas, you name it, the Democrats admit they're
[01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:35.120]  going to bring in another 5% or more of the population who will then be given driver's
[01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:40.680]  license, who will then vote in California and Texas, game over.
[01:34:40.680 --> 01:34:45.800]  They're going to ban the guns, they're going, the armored vehicles, the militarized police,
[01:34:45.800 --> 01:34:46.800]  all of it, they're coming.
[01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:54.520]  I know we got JJ, Steve, Mark, Adam, Damien, and others who we're going to go to here in
[01:34:54.520 --> 01:34:58.320]  just about 10 minutes, but they're filing reports on the ground.
[01:34:58.320 --> 01:35:04.640]  Again, the reporters stayed up until 6 in the morning, and I saw them filing reports
[01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:07.400]  when I woke up at 6 a.m.
[01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:13.600]  I first checked the news while I'm brewing coffee, and they were posting in live time.
[01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:22.560]  Joe Jennings, Adon Salazar, and Jakari Jackson, and when I talked to my reporters on the ground
[01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:27.040]  or even here when they're seeing it, you shake your head when a bus drives right through
[01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:29.960]  the border.
[01:35:29.960 --> 01:35:37.320]  Teenagers get off, they're loaded on white vans and taken to churches, Catholic churches,
[01:35:37.320 --> 01:35:39.360]  Evangelical churches, you name it.
[01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:42.520]  They're at the Sacred Heart Church in McAllen, Texas right now.
[01:35:42.520 --> 01:35:46.960]  We'll show TV viewers a map of that photo and video, a live video, a feed of your radio
[01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:47.960]  listener.
[01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:51.800]  You can hear our reporters, if you're a radio listener and want to see it, go to infowars.com,
[01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:58.120]  forward slash show to see the free feeds or prismplanet.tv, but this is what the mainstream
[01:35:58.120 --> 01:36:00.120]  media won't show you.
[01:36:00.120 --> 01:36:07.040]  Last week we went and showed military bases in San Antonio with thousands of illegal
[01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:11.640]  alien children, and again, they are illegal aliens to this country.
[01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:15.640]  That's the term, resident alien, that's what they call you in Mexico.
[01:36:15.640 --> 01:36:19.160]  If you're there illegally, it's an alien of the country.
[01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:24.680]  It's a statement under common law.
[01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:30.760]  It means that you don't get all the benefits, well instead the illegals get more benefits
[01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:34.840]  than citizens do.
[01:36:34.840 --> 01:36:48.160]  But this is outrageous, and I know I keep saying that, but this is the political takeover.
[01:36:48.160 --> 01:36:56.320]  If these people voted 50% libertarian, 50% communist, I would be upset about it.
[01:36:56.320 --> 01:37:00.760]  If they voted 100% libertarian but got free welfare, I'd be against it because it would
[01:37:00.760 --> 01:37:03.560]  mean that we're creating a welfare class.
[01:37:03.560 --> 01:37:08.080]  Well, we've already created a welfare class and the chickens are coming home to Roosnown
[01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:13.520]  where if they can get enough government constituents in who are on the government payroll, it's
[01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:14.520]  game over.
[01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:23.400]  Let's go to Jakari Jackson, John Bowne, Joe Jennings, and Don Salazar, all four reporters
[01:37:23.400 --> 01:37:27.680]  down there on the border to tell us about what they've witnessed in the last 24 hours
[01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:28.680]  and what's coming up.
[01:37:28.680 --> 01:37:34.120]  Hey, how are you doing, Alex, Jakari Jackson, John Bowne here in McAllen, Texas, as you
[01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:35.120]  already alluded to.
[01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:39.240]  Now, if people haven't seen our video from last night, I do encourage you to go to infowars.com
[01:37:39.240 --> 01:37:40.520]  and also the Drudge Report.
[01:37:40.520 --> 01:37:44.960]  You can see us at a bus station here in McAllen, and we witnessed children getting on church
[01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:49.320]  buses, one church in particular, the family church, also located here in McAllen, Texas.
[01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:52.840]  Now, since then, last night, we had to speculate a little bit because we didn't quite know
[01:37:52.840 --> 01:37:55.560]  for sure that these were illegal immigrants.
[01:37:55.560 --> 01:37:59.200]  Just as that video has posted just about 20 minutes or so ago, we went to the family
[01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:02.760]  church and we were able to talk to somebody off-camera who did confirm that yes, these
[01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:05.840]  are illegal immigrants coming from the Central American countries.
[01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:08.640]  I asked the lady who spoke to me off-camera, I said, you know, where are most of these
[01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:09.640]  people coming from?
[01:38:09.640 --> 01:38:12.240]  She said, you have a lot of people from Guatemala, but she did correct me.
[01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:15.920]  She said none of these children, at least in her care, are coming alone.
[01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:17.920]  All these children are coming with their mothers.
[01:38:17.920 --> 01:38:21.400]  And from the family church, they are moved here to the Sacred Heart Church, also located
[01:38:21.400 --> 01:38:25.920]  just a few blocks from the bus station, and here they have shower facilities, I guess
[01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:29.120]  they get the kids ready, and then from here, they take them back to the bus station, and
[01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:32.840]  I asked the lady at the family church, I said, where are they going from here?
[01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:37.160]  She said, wherever they want to go, they have family here, they have other situations going
[01:38:37.160 --> 01:38:39.240]  on, and they just go wherever they need to go.
[01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:42.760]  Well, that's what Obama said last week.
[01:38:42.760 --> 01:38:48.760]  He said, if you can come here, your families are welcome as well, and invited the immigrants
[01:38:48.760 --> 01:38:50.280]  to come with their children.
[01:38:50.280 --> 01:38:53.640]  I mean, this is unprecedented, Jacari, go ahead.
[01:38:53.640 --> 01:38:58.040]  Yes, and I asked the representative at the family church, I said, who's paying for these
[01:38:58.040 --> 01:38:59.040]  tickets?
[01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:00.040]  She said, you know, they have family that send the money.
[01:39:00.040 --> 01:39:01.800]  I said, is the government involved in any way?
[01:39:01.800 --> 01:39:05.360]  She said, as far as she knows, the government is not.
[01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:10.000]  Well, Kent wrote a story over the weekend that went viral that a listener tipped us
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:11.000]  to.
[01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:16.600]  MPR has the major church groups on raising money to bring them here.
[01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:20.240]  So I'll guarantee you, you look into these churches and look into the larger churches
[01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:26.240]  above them, they're getting donations to basically house these people, pay for their
[01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:31.840]  food and deploy them, and money's being sent into Mexico, into Guatemala, into Nicaragua,
[01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:34.560]  into El Salvador to bring these people up.
[01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:35.560]  That's on record.
[01:39:35.560 --> 01:39:36.560]  That's right.
[01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:37.560]  That's right.
[01:39:37.560 --> 01:39:38.560]  John, what are your thoughts?
[01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:41.920]  Well, speaking on that, Senator John Cornyn three days ago said that we should send money
[01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:42.920]  to Mexico.
[01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:43.920]  Did you see that one?
[01:39:43.920 --> 01:39:44.920]  Yes, I did.
[01:39:44.920 --> 01:39:45.920]  Yeah.
[01:39:45.920 --> 01:39:48.920]  Now, my main concern here is the Cloward-Piven strategy.
[01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:54.120]  People need to get out of their fog and realize this is a complete invasion of America.
[01:39:54.120 --> 01:39:55.440]  Truly is.
[01:39:55.440 --> 01:40:02.720]  They're using your compassion to come in here and create a guaranteed annual strategic income
[01:40:02.720 --> 01:40:03.720]  for all of us.
[01:40:03.720 --> 01:40:07.520]  A flat income is what the Cloward-Piven strategy is.
[01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:10.760]  If you're not familiar with it, you need to get familiar with it right now because it
[01:40:10.760 --> 01:40:14.600]  is the Democratic liberal strategy that they are putting into place, and they're at the
[01:40:14.600 --> 01:40:16.080]  final stages right now.
[01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:17.080]  We're looking at it.
[01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:22.120]  We've also got MS-13 coming through, and the problem with that is that you look at the
[01:40:22.120 --> 01:40:23.120]  ISIS soldiers.
[01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:25.640]  A lot of those soldiers in ISIS are teenagers.
[01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:29.080]  A lot of the soldiers in the Ivory Coast are teenagers.
[01:40:29.080 --> 01:40:33.160]  What happens when we have these teenage psychotics?
[01:40:33.160 --> 01:40:36.600]  The gangsters here in the U.S. are often teenagers as well.
[01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:38.880]  One more thing to add on to what John was saying.
[01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:42.640]  We hear so much that these children are trying to flee the conditions in their country.
[01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:43.880]  What about the conditions in this country?
[01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:46.680]  As John already said, we already have a gang problem here in the United States.
[01:40:46.680 --> 01:40:53.960]  How does having collapsing Mexico collapse into us and then making us a third-world country?
[01:40:53.960 --> 01:40:55.600]  How does that fix it?
[01:40:55.600 --> 01:41:00.440]  These are unskilled people pouring in, going directly on.
[01:41:00.440 --> 01:41:03.720]  These are not the hard work in Mexican men that I see all over the place, busting their
[01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:05.320]  butts for their family.
[01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:08.320]  Nobody denies they work hard.
[01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:11.400]  This is a bunch of kids and a bunch of gang members.
[01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:14.520]  What do you think is behind that, John Bowne, Jakari, Jackson?
[01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:19.320]  Well, Alex, we try to be polite for the folks down here because we respect people that are
[01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:22.080]  of Mexican descent that are Americans.
[01:41:22.080 --> 01:41:25.960]  The more people that we've spoken to in this area, in the valley, that are of Mexican descent
[01:41:25.960 --> 01:41:31.840]  that are legal Americans, natural, they're more afraid than anybody because they're
[01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:38.040]  going to come into their communities first with their diseases, scabies, rabies, MRSA,
[01:41:38.040 --> 01:41:42.800]  the chickenpox outbreaks, but the more of them you stack together in rooms that are
[01:41:42.800 --> 01:41:46.400]  incredibly small, the more disease outbreaks you're going to see and then you're just going
[01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:47.400]  to release them on the street.
[01:41:47.400 --> 01:41:48.400]  Well, it's more than that.
[01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:49.400]  It's more than that.
[01:41:49.400 --> 01:41:52.880]  When I was a child, when I was in college, we would go down to Brownsville, all those
[01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:53.880]  places.
[01:41:53.880 --> 01:41:54.880]  It was nice on both sides.
[01:41:54.880 --> 01:41:59.880]  It's a hellhole of boarded-up shops on the other side and it's moving to the other side.
[01:41:59.880 --> 01:42:01.720]  They want prosperity down there.
[01:42:01.720 --> 01:42:07.480]  People down on the border know you don't want to make this side Mexico taking all the criminals
[01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:08.480]  on.
[01:42:08.480 --> 01:42:09.480]  And so you're right.
[01:42:09.480 --> 01:42:15.840]  In fact, it's the wealthy and middle-class Mexicans that I know that live in Austin who've
[01:42:15.840 --> 01:42:20.920]  all fled to Austin who I totally welcome because they've got trades and they've got money and
[01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:21.920]  it's great.
[01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:25.160]  I mean, I welcome the middle-class Mexicans, come up here all day long.
[01:42:25.160 --> 01:42:28.360]  They are the ones that come to you and say, do you know what's going on?
[01:42:28.360 --> 01:42:30.440]  Do you know how you're going to be kidnapped?
[01:42:30.440 --> 01:42:32.240]  Do you know there'll be nowhere to run?
[01:42:32.240 --> 01:42:36.440]  I love your show, Mr. Jones, because they've already fled it.
[01:42:36.440 --> 01:42:37.440]  You see what I'm saying?
[01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:40.720]  That's exactly right, because you have to look at why they're coming here.
[01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:44.440]  So they come here to flee these gang problems or whatever, these social problems, and then
[01:42:44.440 --> 01:42:46.680]  they come here and then they just have the same problems here because they bring the
[01:42:46.680 --> 01:42:47.680]  problems with them.
[01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:48.680]  Bring them with them.
[01:42:48.680 --> 01:42:49.680]  Yep.
[01:42:49.680 --> 01:42:55.120]  Well, it's true that everything from flesh-eating bacteria to leprosy, you name it, I mean,
[01:42:55.120 --> 01:43:01.640]  I know two people personally, one in Austin, one in Arizona, who have gotten the weird
[01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:06.600]  amoebas that are only like in Brazil and are supposedly only able to live down there that
[01:43:06.600 --> 01:43:08.880]  absolutely wreck your body.
[01:43:08.880 --> 01:43:13.520]  I mean, it's all coming here, which it's literally, and people say, oh, yeah, right.
[01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:16.080]  That's the classic thing, say immigrants have diseases.
[01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:18.520]  These people have not been to Brazil.
[01:43:18.520 --> 01:43:24.480]  They've not been, I mean, they have no idea what Calcutta, India's like, guys.
[01:43:24.480 --> 01:43:25.480]  That's right.
[01:43:25.480 --> 01:43:27.800]  And then when they get here, if they have these various conditions and they get in the
[01:43:27.800 --> 01:43:30.640]  pharmaceutical program, and that's a whole nother racket.
[01:43:30.640 --> 01:43:32.480]  Well, see, that's the deal.
[01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:37.880]  The government and the corporations with the welfare system, they want the people that
[01:43:37.880 --> 01:43:41.960]  don't have jobs or the 14-year-olds that are going to be an institutionalized for four
[01:43:41.960 --> 01:43:42.960]  years at least.
[01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:47.400]  I mean, we're talking about millions of dollars per illegal that the big corporations that
[01:43:47.400 --> 01:43:50.280]  are administering government programs are going to milk.
[01:43:50.280 --> 01:43:52.160]  That's right.
[01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:54.920]  Now, guys, I'm ranting a little bit.
[01:43:54.920 --> 01:43:57.240]  Let's go over and look with the sky.
[01:43:57.240 --> 01:44:02.960]  Walk over, Jacarie, walk over, John Bowne, give us a tour of the buses, because, I mean,
[01:44:02.960 --> 01:44:06.920]  look, we knew they were illegals when it's the border, and Greyhound buses pull through
[01:44:06.920 --> 01:44:11.120]  and kids get out with their bags and their parents aren't with them, and then they come
[01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:12.120]  into the United States.
[01:44:12.120 --> 01:44:15.800]  I mean, that was obviously what happened, but you talked to the Sacred Heart Church
[01:44:15.800 --> 01:44:20.320]  and they confirmed, yes, these are, well, I guess they call them undocumented or what
[01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:21.320]  do they call them?
[01:44:21.320 --> 01:44:22.680]  Yeah, we talked to the family church.
[01:44:22.680 --> 01:44:27.320]  We're at the Sacred Heart Church, I talked to one of the McCallan public servants out
[01:44:27.320 --> 01:44:28.320]  here.
[01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:31.560]  He said that all the people here are currently in a meeting, but as I can see right now, maybe
[01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:32.560]  we can get a camera shot.
[01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:36.400]  I see some kids out here playing out here in the facility.
[01:44:36.400 --> 01:44:41.280]  But yes, we plan to go back after a few minutes and try to talk to one of the representatives
[01:44:41.280 --> 01:44:43.480]  here to find out exactly what is going on.
[01:44:43.480 --> 01:44:47.720]  You see, this is an infiltration point, so they want to mask the folks there, keep it
[01:44:47.720 --> 01:44:52.560]  quiet, give them Democratic Party marching orders, deploy to Battleground, Texas, where
[01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:54.680]  they then handed the driver's license.
[01:44:54.680 --> 01:44:59.160]  And remember, the Veritas Project caught Battleground, Texas on video saying, we're
[01:44:59.160 --> 01:45:00.160]  going to get them to vote.
[01:45:00.160 --> 01:45:01.160]  We're going to get them ID cards.
[01:45:01.160 --> 01:45:03.160]  I mean, this is a criminal takeover.
[01:45:03.160 --> 01:45:08.280]  Yeah, and you have to look at the incentivize, the why they come here, because they see all
[01:45:08.280 --> 01:45:09.280]  these incentives.
[01:45:09.280 --> 01:45:11.160]  They see the free driver's licenses.
[01:45:11.160 --> 01:45:14.800]  They see the in-state tuition, then they come here, and then now you have Joe Biden going
[01:45:14.800 --> 01:45:18.920]  to the Central American countries and saying, please stop sending your kids here, even though
[01:45:18.920 --> 01:45:21.120]  they're being used as a political weapon.
[01:45:21.120 --> 01:45:25.920]  Oh, well, yeah, that's them acting like wink, wink, please stop, even though we've stopped
[01:45:25.920 --> 01:45:28.960]  deportations, even though we say your family can come up.
[01:45:28.960 --> 01:45:31.680]  This is totally premeditated.
[01:45:31.680 --> 01:45:37.080]  And again, if they were coming up here and we're pro-gun, pro-freedom, and we're in such
[01:45:37.080 --> 01:45:42.880]  a fight against the socialists that I would say fine, but it still violates the law so
[01:45:42.880 --> 01:45:44.480]  it's immoral.
[01:45:44.480 --> 01:45:48.720]  And then libertarians say, well, hey, don't have borders, but they've got borders on us.
[01:45:48.720 --> 01:45:52.240]  Not if we get rid of our border, but all these other countries still have their borders.
[01:45:52.240 --> 01:45:55.280]  See, there's still a border there.
[01:45:55.280 --> 01:45:56.280]  See what I'm saying?
[01:45:56.280 --> 01:45:57.280]  Oh, yeah.
[01:45:57.280 --> 01:45:58.280]  Oh, yeah.
[01:45:58.280 --> 01:45:59.280]  And we can't go to Switzerland.
[01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:00.560]  We can't move into Sweden.
[01:46:00.560 --> 01:46:01.720]  I can't go there.
[01:46:01.720 --> 01:46:06.880]  I can't go anywhere except the United States and live the rest of my life comfortably with
[01:46:06.880 --> 01:46:07.880]  what we have.
[01:46:07.880 --> 01:46:13.880]  John, you've got to have, because I've checked into it, $5 million, and you've got to have
[01:46:13.880 --> 01:46:20.160]  a discretionary income and job that they want in Switzerland, like an engineer, a scientist,
[01:46:20.160 --> 01:46:24.720]  and then they have a bored look if they even want to let you move to Switzerland.
[01:46:24.720 --> 01:46:25.720]  Right.
[01:46:25.720 --> 01:46:26.720]  Right.
[01:46:26.720 --> 01:46:27.720]  So what are we doing?
[01:46:27.720 --> 01:46:33.320]  So I can't move to Switzerland, but these illegals come here and they get my tax money.
[01:46:33.320 --> 01:46:35.240]  And they may kill you.
[01:46:35.240 --> 01:46:39.000]  That's the bottom line right there.
[01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:40.000]  Yeah.
[01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.320]  I mean, there are plenty of good people who come here, but you have to do it the legal
[01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:46.000]  lawful way, just like, as you said, you have borders for a reason, you know, I can't go
[01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:47.000]  down to Mexico.
[01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:48.560]  They always try to make it some racial thing.
[01:46:48.560 --> 01:46:50.680]  Oh, you harass people at the Mexican border.
[01:46:50.680 --> 01:46:54.080]  I was like, if I go down to Mexico, as an American citizen, I'm going to get stopped
[01:46:54.080 --> 01:46:55.080]  at a border.
[01:46:55.080 --> 01:46:57.640]  When I go back to Austin, Texas, here in a couple of days, I'm going to get stopped
[01:46:57.640 --> 01:47:00.040]  by the border patrol who are nowhere near the border.
[01:47:00.040 --> 01:47:01.040]  How many miles are they?
[01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:03.520]  Well, not to mention you get put in a Mexican jail.
[01:47:03.520 --> 01:47:06.800]  You know how you get treated down in Mexico on a Mexican jail?
[01:47:06.800 --> 01:47:08.160]  You come up here, you get put in jail.
[01:47:08.160 --> 01:47:09.160]  They don't even put you in jail.
[01:47:09.160 --> 01:47:12.280]  They take care of you, they feed you, and they send you on your way.
[01:47:12.280 --> 01:47:13.880]  No matter how many crimes you've committed.
[01:47:13.880 --> 01:47:14.880]  That's right.
[01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:15.880]  That's right.
[01:47:15.880 --> 01:47:17.760]  They're releasing aggravated felons.
[01:47:17.760 --> 01:47:19.400]  Give us some shots for TV viewers.
[01:47:19.400 --> 01:47:21.160]  This is very newsworthy, guys.
[01:47:21.160 --> 01:47:22.160]  Incredible job.
[01:47:22.160 --> 01:47:24.800]  Step out the way and let our camera get some shots here.
[01:47:24.800 --> 01:47:26.800]  Now what you see behind you is a facility.
[01:47:26.800 --> 01:47:33.520]  This is the Sacred Heart facility, excuse me, kids out here, playing football, basketball,
[01:47:33.520 --> 01:47:35.360]  and I guess we can walk around here a little bit.
[01:47:35.360 --> 01:47:37.040]  Here's five blocks from the bus station.
[01:47:37.040 --> 01:47:38.680]  We're about five blocks from the bus station.
[01:47:38.680 --> 01:47:39.680]  Yeah.
[01:47:39.680 --> 01:47:40.680]  Let's watch the boys there.
[01:47:40.680 --> 01:47:43.240]  What's the point, you guys, to do, I mean, obviously, target's an opportunity to do whatever
[01:47:43.240 --> 01:47:48.080]  you want, but I would start, I would go and follow those buses and then follow those
[01:47:48.080 --> 01:47:49.080]  vans.
[01:47:49.080 --> 01:47:52.880]  Well, you know the thing about it, the buses don't seem to be running today, at least that
[01:47:52.880 --> 01:47:53.880]  we've seen.
[01:47:53.880 --> 01:47:56.600]  We've gone to the church and also to the bus station.
[01:47:56.600 --> 01:48:00.440]  We didn't see any buses running today, and we were able to confirm with the first church
[01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:04.160]  we visited that their offices are closed and that potentially means that their buses are
[01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:05.400]  down for this day.
[01:48:05.400 --> 01:48:08.960]  But we do want to go down to Hidalgo and actually have people coming across the border.
[01:48:08.960 --> 01:48:12.920]  There's supposed to be hundreds of people just crossing in broad daylight.
[01:48:12.920 --> 01:48:17.440]  Tell us about your different federal whistleblowers you're going to be talking to.
[01:48:17.440 --> 01:48:21.960]  Well, one of our reporters, Don Salazar, was able to get in touch with, I believe it was
[01:48:21.960 --> 01:48:26.640]  an ICE agent, and he doesn't want to be identified, so we're not going to say his name, but he's
[01:48:26.640 --> 01:48:31.040]  supposed to give us some whistleblower information, tell us exactly what's going on, tell us about
[01:48:31.040 --> 01:48:34.800]  how even the ICE agents and the board patrol agents are very much concerned about what's
[01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:38.720]  happening and how some of the board of patrolmen have come out and said blatantly that, yes,
[01:48:38.720 --> 01:48:41.840]  this is an intentional plan to bring these people here.
[01:48:41.840 --> 01:48:45.560]  And this is another part of the facility, the Sacred Heart Facility.
[01:48:45.560 --> 01:48:48.640]  This looks maybe like some type of housing unit.
[01:48:48.640 --> 01:48:49.800]  It's a very large complex.
[01:48:49.800 --> 01:48:55.200]  Yeah, and they are in there during the day and then released at night into the streets.
[01:48:55.200 --> 01:48:56.200]  Yeah.
[01:48:56.200 --> 01:48:59.320]  Well, then you need to catch them tonight.
[01:48:59.320 --> 01:49:00.320]  Just incredible job.
[01:49:00.320 --> 01:49:02.200]  How long are you guys going to be staying down there?
[01:49:02.200 --> 01:49:05.080]  Well, we're trying to hit as many targets as we can.
[01:49:05.080 --> 01:49:08.960]  And as John said, we're trying to get out to Hildoggo and a couple other locations.
[01:49:08.960 --> 01:49:10.960]  So what do you think, John?
[01:49:10.960 --> 01:49:15.320]  Well, I would say at least till Tuesday, we need to go to Brownsville and we need also
[01:49:15.320 --> 01:49:19.360]  to talk to the locals and see, get that document and how they feel about this, because people
[01:49:19.360 --> 01:49:20.360]  really are upset.
[01:49:20.360 --> 01:49:22.360]  And just some of the casual conversations I've had with people.
[01:49:22.360 --> 01:49:27.000]  Well, I'm telling you, if you catch video of them exfiltrating the illegals at night,
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:28.640]  they're acting like it's an underground railroad.
[01:49:28.640 --> 01:49:30.800]  That's what Christian Charges of liking to do is slavery.
[01:49:30.800 --> 01:49:34.680]  Now, the underground railroad, which my ancestors were involved in and a lot of Christians
[01:49:34.680 --> 01:49:40.160]  were getting freed black slaves or runaway slaves out of the South into the North.
[01:49:40.160 --> 01:49:46.320]  How is it that we have to have everybody from China, Eastern Europe, Mexico, Latin America,
[01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:47.660]  taxpayer paid for?
[01:49:47.660 --> 01:49:50.320]  How is it an underground railroad to ship them all into the country?
[01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:53.880]  Isn't that really an insult to former slaves?
[01:49:53.880 --> 01:49:58.680]  How is what they're going through anything compared to what people went through in slavery
[01:49:58.680 --> 01:49:59.680]  in this country?
[01:49:59.680 --> 01:50:03.840]  But I mean, it's just they're being bussed up here with sack lunches and then put on
[01:50:03.840 --> 01:50:04.840]  the welfare rolls.
[01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:08.640]  I mean, I just, no country's ever done this.
[01:50:08.640 --> 01:50:09.640]  Great job, guys.
[01:50:09.640 --> 01:50:10.640]  You choose whatever you want to cover.

[01:52:06.840 --> 01:52:12.360]  of using synthetic chemicals sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the
[01:52:12.360 --> 01:52:16.280]  planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[01:52:16.280 --> 01:52:21.000]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago and I must say that was good stuff.
[01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:24.320]  There are consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others.

[01:52:37.200 --> 01:52:38.200]  dose.

[01:54:04.440 --> 01:54:20.600]  Reaching war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:54:20.600 --> 01:54:22.320]  Alright, I'm going right to your phone calls.
[01:54:22.320 --> 01:54:26.720]  I just want to remind listeners that we have the very best supplements out there.
[01:54:26.720 --> 01:54:33.320]  Barnyne, the proprietary Nation Iodine from Deep Earth, pure purple crystals, and see
[01:54:33.320 --> 01:54:40.840]  the video that breaks down the science of it at infowarslife.com or infowarsstore.com.
[01:54:40.840 --> 01:54:47.040]  It's ancient multi-million-year-old, ancient seabed crystals that actually go directly
[01:54:47.040 --> 01:54:50.600]  into the body in the solution.
[01:54:50.600 --> 01:54:53.760]  No one else has anything else like this.
[01:54:53.760 --> 01:54:59.280]  And what it's done for me personally, my stamina, my energy, my focus, my clarity, my health,
[01:54:59.280 --> 01:55:03.280]  my skin, this is the halogen conspiracy.
[01:55:03.280 --> 01:55:06.360]  The halogen table has got a bunch of stuff that's really bad for you like fluoride in
[01:55:06.360 --> 01:55:07.360]  it.
[01:55:07.360 --> 01:55:12.600]  So they put all that in the food and water and then don't put in the good halogen that
[01:55:12.600 --> 01:55:19.520]  Dr. Group produces in the purest form, the strongest, purest 99.99% iodine, blowing away
[01:55:19.520 --> 01:55:21.840]  the competition by light years.
[01:55:21.840 --> 01:55:25.120]  Their stuff's black, our stuff's purple, turns electric blue.
[01:55:25.120 --> 01:55:27.440]  It is true Nation Iodine.
[01:55:27.440 --> 01:55:33.240]  Take the challenge, get it today at infowarslife.com and try it and see what it does for you and
[01:55:33.240 --> 01:55:36.240]  your family, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:55:36.240 --> 01:55:38.520]  We also have the original survival shield.
[01:55:38.520 --> 01:55:39.520]  It isn't as strong.
[01:55:39.520 --> 01:55:41.960]  Check with your physician, but I think it's better for kids.
[01:55:41.960 --> 01:55:46.320]  Survival shield, survival shield X2, infowarslife.com.
[01:55:46.320 --> 01:55:52.680]  Let's go to JJ, then Chad, Mark, Adam, Damien and others on the Iraq situation and on the
[01:55:52.680 --> 01:55:53.680]  topic of illegals.
[01:55:53.680 --> 01:55:55.960]  JJ, thanks for holding her on the ear.
[01:55:55.960 --> 01:55:59.160]  Hey Alex, how you doing today?
[01:55:59.160 --> 01:56:03.760]  Here's the start of the show, I actually, I'm just so freaked out.
[01:56:03.760 --> 01:56:07.160]  I mean, everything's happening right now, the country's being shut down.
[01:56:07.160 --> 01:56:10.640]  I physically mourn and I'm not trying to be melodramatic.
[01:56:10.640 --> 01:56:12.000]  I mean, I'm freaked out.
[01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:13.000]  What about you?
[01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:14.000]  I'm freaked out.
[01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:18.480]  I can feel it in the pit of my stomach because we got these people coming across the borders.
[01:56:18.480 --> 01:56:21.640]  There's no shot records on these people.
[01:56:21.640 --> 01:56:27.920]  There's no documentation on any of their records as far as arrest records.
[01:56:27.920 --> 01:56:32.520]  Just the other day, I was over here at the store in Austin and three guys stopped me.
[01:56:32.520 --> 01:56:35.960]  There were federal marshals looking for one of those rapists that they just left out of
[01:56:35.960 --> 01:56:36.960]  jail.
[01:56:36.960 --> 01:56:38.680]  They've asked me twice, have you seen this guy?
[01:56:38.680 --> 01:56:41.120]  So I know they let those criminals out.
[01:56:41.120 --> 01:56:42.120]  Oh no, no, no, yeah, yeah.
[01:56:42.120 --> 01:56:45.360]  One group lets them out and the rest of the feds have to chase them around.
[01:56:45.360 --> 01:56:46.840]  It's total lawlessness.
[01:56:46.840 --> 01:56:47.840]  It's exactly.
[01:56:47.840 --> 01:56:54.760]  Yes, I think that what needs to be done, can you imagine if all these people that are
[01:56:54.760 --> 01:57:00.840]  coming across the borders were Muslims, Americans would be having a cow.
[01:57:00.840 --> 01:57:03.240]  Well you know, that's what the Border Patrol whistleblower told us.
[01:57:03.240 --> 01:57:12.440]  He said a big percentage is actually from places of interest, radical Islamic countries.
[01:57:12.440 --> 01:57:13.440]  That's actually happening.
[01:57:13.440 --> 01:57:16.000]  Yeah, it's just uncalled for.
[01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:19.680]  I don't know why our government's even allowing this to happen.
[01:57:19.680 --> 01:57:23.400]  You know, I'm a veteran and you know, I applied for food stamps.
[01:57:23.400 --> 01:57:26.720]  They said I could get $16 a month for food stamps.
[01:57:26.720 --> 01:57:28.640]  I'm like, wait a minute.
[01:57:28.640 --> 01:57:32.600]  You know, and then we got people coming across the border getting free healthcare, free everything
[01:57:32.600 --> 01:57:33.600]  for our licenses.
[01:57:33.600 --> 01:57:37.600]  Listen, brother, I got a bunch of family that 10 years ago were middle class and now can't
[01:57:37.600 --> 01:57:38.720]  pay for gas.
[01:57:38.720 --> 01:57:42.920]  The country's in a depression, they want to, the whole world's collapsing.
[01:57:42.920 --> 01:57:47.760]  Spain is collapsing, Portugal, Greece, Italy, there's riots everywhere.
[01:57:47.760 --> 01:57:53.000]  Yeah, we got to step up to the plate as Americans and make sure that this doesn't happen to
[01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.600]  our country as patriots and we have to do something.
[01:57:55.600 --> 01:57:56.600]  What do you think we should do?
[01:57:56.600 --> 01:57:59.320]  Just as a, what can the average Joe do, Alex?
[01:57:59.320 --> 01:58:04.480]  I think people should go right now down to Home Depot, right off 535 and 290 and you'll
[01:58:04.480 --> 01:58:08.880]  see in the morning a hundred illegals at one time, they're running around.
[01:58:08.880 --> 01:58:14.280]  And the point is, you show that, then you show the TSA groping people.
[01:58:14.280 --> 01:58:17.200]  See, see, that's what's so bad about this.
[01:58:17.200 --> 01:58:21.080]  They act like all of us, black, white, Hispanic, doesn't matter.
[01:58:21.080 --> 01:58:25.640]  We're terror suspects with no criminal record, we're citizens.
[01:58:25.640 --> 01:58:29.880]  Then anybody wants to come across the border, oh, we don't need any ID, you're fine.
[01:58:29.880 --> 01:58:32.360]  It shows it's all a fraud.
[01:58:32.360 --> 01:58:37.880]  We should just literally not comply until the government gets back in line with anything.
[01:58:37.880 --> 01:58:44.400]  They're not, they're not complying with anything, they're not following the law, you got a bunch
[01:58:44.400 --> 01:58:48.800]  of people that hate America running this government, I mean it comes down to that.
[01:58:48.800 --> 01:58:52.280]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Groot.
[01:58:52.280 --> 01:58:57.920]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity
[01:58:57.920 --> 01:58:59.720]  iodine available.
[01:58:59.720 --> 01:59:08.160]  The new survival shield X2 is mined from 7 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine
[01:59:08.160 --> 01:59:10.560]  environmentally clean conditions.
[01:59:10.560 --> 01:59:18.760]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million-plus year old deposit
[01:59:18.760 --> 01:59:20.560]  deep in the earth.
[01:59:20.560 --> 01:59:24.560]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[01:59:24.560 --> 01:59:28.880]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[01:59:28.880 --> 01:59:33.240]  Experience the new formula, experience the ancient purity.
[01:59:33.240 --> 01:59:39.320]  Shield your family, Survival Shield X2, available now at InfowarsLife.com.

[02:00:13.400 --> 02:00:17.560]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.560 --> 02:00:30.480]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:30.480 --> 02:00:34.680]  Bottom line, the laws you don't apply to the illegals.
[02:00:34.680 --> 02:00:36.480]  Bottom line, the government's lawless.
[02:00:36.480 --> 02:00:39.280]  Bottom line, al-Qaeda under the name ISIS is being
[02:00:39.280 --> 02:00:42.360]  given the entire Middle East as I've been telling you.
[02:00:42.360 --> 02:00:46.840]  But I still can't believe the government is this crazy to do something like this.
[02:00:46.840 --> 02:00:51.040]  My dad was over with the kids for Father's Day or State and he looked at me and he said,
[02:00:51.040 --> 02:00:56.440]  I got a bad feeling, son, I think you're right about all this and the elite are just going
[02:00:56.440 --> 02:00:58.440]  to gut up and go crazy.
[02:00:58.440 --> 02:00:59.440]  And I go, what do you mean?
[02:00:59.440 --> 02:01:05.000]  He goes, just do everything.
[02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:09.480]  They just are crazy because they're never get held responsible.
[02:01:09.480 --> 02:01:13.040]  Let's go to Adam in Iowa on Osama bin Laden in the Iraq War.
[02:01:13.040 --> 02:01:14.040]  Go ahead.
[02:01:14.040 --> 02:01:17.880]  Yeah, how you doing today, Alex?
[02:01:17.880 --> 02:01:20.240]  You know, I just, I'm not trying to whine.
[02:01:20.240 --> 02:01:21.880]  I just really feel upset.
[02:01:21.880 --> 02:01:22.880]  I'm very disgusted.
[02:01:22.880 --> 02:01:26.880]  You got a hard job.
[02:01:26.880 --> 02:01:27.880]  Yeah.
[02:01:27.880 --> 02:01:35.680]  Well, if you type into the search engine, Osama bin Laden with George Bush, yeah, I'd
[02:01:35.680 --> 02:01:38.320]  be back in 93, 94, somewhere in there.
[02:01:38.320 --> 02:01:43.680]  You can actually find the interview where he's interviewing Osama bin Laden that proves
[02:01:43.680 --> 02:01:46.680]  we're financing al-Qaeda.
[02:01:46.680 --> 02:01:47.680]  Anybody can do that.
[02:01:47.680 --> 02:01:52.440]  And I have nothing against the immigrants as long as, you know, they actually do it
[02:01:52.440 --> 02:01:53.440]  legally.
[02:01:53.440 --> 02:01:56.920]  If they do it legally, I have no problem at all with it.
[02:01:56.920 --> 02:01:59.920]  And this one here is more for you.
[02:01:59.920 --> 02:02:02.480]  God works in mysterious ways.
[02:02:02.480 --> 02:02:07.000]  I've been awake now for about seven months, watching your show, a friend of mine turned
[02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:08.000]  me on to it.
[02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:13.440]  And since then, I've awoken 20 people just in my time alone.
[02:02:13.440 --> 02:02:19.960]  So when you say you're not doing well, cheer up because you are.
[02:02:19.960 --> 02:02:21.640]  You're doing a fantastic job.
[02:02:21.640 --> 02:02:22.640]  I know.
[02:02:22.640 --> 02:02:25.480]  I tell myself every day, brother, be positive, be happy.
[02:02:25.480 --> 02:02:27.240]  You're having an effect.
[02:02:27.240 --> 02:02:29.240]  I can't help it sometimes.
[02:02:29.240 --> 02:02:32.920]  I'm just being honest with the listeners the last month or so.
[02:02:32.920 --> 02:02:37.760]  I just, it's beyond disgust I have for the establishment.
[02:02:37.760 --> 02:02:41.640]  Watching them try to wreck things, try to make people poor.
[02:02:41.640 --> 02:02:46.040]  Watching them turn the world over to al-Qaeda and slaughter Christians everywhere.
[02:02:46.040 --> 02:02:49.400]  It's just hard to believe they're this bad.
[02:02:49.400 --> 02:02:51.480]  And where's the general public waking up?
[02:02:51.480 --> 02:02:53.160]  I appreciate your call.
[02:02:53.160 --> 02:02:54.160]  I appreciate it.
[02:02:54.160 --> 02:02:57.400]  And I should put a better face on myself here.
[02:02:57.400 --> 02:03:01.120]  My problem is I've always been so honest about how I feel, so I'm in a nasty mood.
[02:03:01.120 --> 02:03:03.760]  I'm honest about it.
[02:03:03.760 --> 02:03:05.480]  I'm just sick of these people, man.
[02:03:05.480 --> 02:03:07.600]  I'm sick of them.
[02:03:07.600 --> 02:03:09.120]  Damien in Arizona, you're on the air.
[02:03:09.120 --> 02:03:10.120]  Go ahead.
[02:03:10.120 --> 02:03:11.120]  Yeah.
[02:03:11.120 --> 02:03:12.120]  How are you doing, Alex?
[02:03:12.120 --> 02:03:16.800]  Sometimes I'll get your, so I get them, so I'm trying to call to make sure if I heard
[02:03:16.800 --> 02:03:22.600]  you right at the near end of a Dr. Monty interview, do you just call for intervention and you're
[02:03:22.600 --> 02:03:23.600]  off?
[02:03:23.600 --> 02:03:24.600]  No.
[02:03:24.600 --> 02:03:31.840]  I was pointing out as Deadpool's advocate that now the West has funded al-Qaeda to go
[02:03:31.840 --> 02:03:38.640]  in and do this, and Obama is trying to act like, oh, we don't know how to target them
[02:03:38.640 --> 02:03:39.640]  with drones.
[02:03:39.640 --> 02:03:42.080]  They're all lined up on highways invading.
[02:03:42.080 --> 02:03:48.120]  They could wipe out half these people with a few dozen A-10 warthogs.
[02:03:48.120 --> 02:03:51.560]  So my point is is that they're fully behind it.
[02:03:51.560 --> 02:03:56.640]  But I'll be honest with you, I'm against intervention because the globalists are evil, and no matter
[02:03:56.640 --> 02:03:58.640]  what they do, it's going to be turned to evil.
[02:03:58.640 --> 02:04:03.240]  But quite frankly, I'd like to see A-10 warthogs take out all those al-Qaeda people.
[02:04:03.240 --> 02:04:04.720]  Yeah, I would like to see that.
[02:04:04.720 --> 02:04:08.760]  I'd like to see a good president, a bunch of al-Qaeda invading out of Saudi Arabia and
[02:04:08.760 --> 02:04:09.760]  Syria.
[02:04:09.760 --> 02:04:10.760]  I'd like to see them all blown to hell.
[02:04:10.760 --> 02:04:15.760]  It's the same al-Qaeda that attacking the Syrians and killing 300,000 Christians in the last
[02:04:15.760 --> 02:04:16.760]  three years.
[02:04:16.760 --> 02:04:19.440]  So at a gut level, I want them dead.
[02:04:19.440 --> 02:04:20.960]  Yeah, you bet.
[02:04:20.960 --> 02:04:25.160]  I'm sick of seeing al-Qaeda with black flags chopping people's heads off, they're a bunch
[02:04:25.160 --> 02:04:26.160]  of scum.
[02:04:26.160 --> 02:04:31.280]  Our area, if the military was run by good people, honest people, and actually a new order
[02:04:31.280 --> 02:04:35.040]  of war, controlling them, so it would be like if you want them sent in, you'd be sending
[02:04:35.040 --> 02:04:36.040]  them to thank people.
[02:04:36.040 --> 02:04:37.040]  It's the Ring of Mordor, though.
[02:04:37.040 --> 02:04:38.120]  I agree with my teeth.
[02:04:38.120 --> 02:04:43.040]  You can't do it because it always just turns to evil.
[02:04:43.040 --> 02:04:48.920]  Because the globalists can't lose if they always find evil, both sides.
[02:04:48.920 --> 02:04:50.080]  Because they just want to sell weapons.
[02:04:50.080 --> 02:04:51.920]  They want to just keep it going forever.
[02:04:51.920 --> 02:05:21.880]  And it's sick, and the public better figure out full spectrum dominance.
[02:05:21.880 --> 02:05:38.400]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high quality, storable foods for my Patriot supply.

[02:05:57.720 --> 02:06:03.640]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about
[02:06:03.640 --> 02:06:05.320]  a potential forthood situation?
[02:06:05.320 --> 02:06:08.560]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[02:06:08.560 --> 02:06:09.560]  Here we go, folks.
[02:06:09.560 --> 02:06:10.560]  How many are silent?
[02:06:10.560 --> 02:06:14.600]  Here it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news.
[02:06:14.600 --> 02:06:16.760]  In Four Wars is the tip of the spear.
[02:06:16.760 --> 02:06:20.280]  Is this another false flight stage attack to take our civil liberties and promote homeland
[02:06:20.280 --> 02:06:22.880]  security while sticking the hands down on our pants on the streets?
[02:06:22.880 --> 02:06:26.840]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[02:06:26.840 --> 02:06:29.880]  And that's what prisonplanet.tv is designed to do.
[02:06:29.880 --> 02:06:36.320]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against
[02:06:36.320 --> 02:06:38.200]  the so-called rebels.
[02:06:38.200 --> 02:06:41.680]  What we see now is a war against reality, it's a war against the truth.
[02:06:41.680 --> 02:06:47.280]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of prisonplanet.tv
[02:06:47.280 --> 02:06:50.840]  and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[02:06:59.040 --> 02:07:01.800]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[02:07:01.800 --> 02:07:07.440]  Supermail vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of
[02:07:07.440 --> 02:07:13.520]  using synthetic chemicals sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet
[02:07:13.520 --> 02:07:16.840]  and then concentrated or maximum potency.
[02:07:16.840 --> 02:07:21.560]  I just received my mail vitality about three days ago and I must say that was good stuff.
[02:07:21.560 --> 02:07:25.920]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed
[02:07:25.920 --> 02:07:32.520]  what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic supermail vitality formula.
[02:07:32.520 --> 02:07:37.920]  Supermail vitality by Info Wars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended
[02:07:37.920 --> 02:07:38.920]  dose.
[02:07:38.920 --> 02:07:41.120]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[02:07:41.120 --> 02:07:45.040]  I look forward to waking up and taking my supermail vitality and get the day started.
[02:07:45.040 --> 02:07:50.240]  It's not just the supermail vitality, all the products in infowarslife.com are simply

[02:08:15.560 --> 02:08:25.160]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:25.160 --> 02:08:29.680]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central, we're here live, back weeknight,
[02:08:29.680 --> 02:08:34.160]  7 o'clock Central, with Info Wars Nightly News.
[02:08:34.160 --> 02:08:38.400]  Friday, if you're watching the Nightly News, you got to see half the show hosted out of
[02:08:38.400 --> 02:08:39.400]  the new studio.
[02:08:39.400 --> 02:08:45.680]  And more and more, I'm going to be segueing over into the studio and doing live sections
[02:08:45.680 --> 02:08:48.840]  of the news, other nights taped to air.
[02:08:48.840 --> 02:08:52.280]  We're getting even more great reporters here into the operation.
[02:08:52.280 --> 02:08:54.280]  It's very exciting.
[02:08:54.280 --> 02:08:56.480]  And we're showing the dinosaur media how it's done.
[02:08:56.480 --> 02:09:03.360]  You notice every couple days now, our reporters on the ground, just in Texas, but also in
[02:09:03.360 --> 02:09:09.480]  other cities, are making national news.
[02:09:09.480 --> 02:09:14.520]  And it's because mainstream media reporters are not allowed to go out and do real stories.
[02:09:14.520 --> 02:09:19.360]  It's only after it breaks that it ends up on CNN or Fox News.
[02:09:19.360 --> 02:09:24.320]  The illegals being bused in by the hundreds of thousands being given basically a free
[02:09:24.320 --> 02:09:25.320]  ride.
[02:09:25.320 --> 02:09:29.680]  And our reporters are down in South Texas on the border right now.
[02:09:29.680 --> 02:09:33.840]  So we're going to be having updates tomorrow and Wednesday with our reporters coming up
[02:09:33.840 --> 02:09:34.840]  after the bottom of the hour.
[02:09:34.840 --> 02:09:39.360]  I'm going to go to your phone calls, Tom, Chad, Mark, Pamela, Skip, everybody we're going
[02:09:39.360 --> 02:09:43.600]  to get to, your first Chad and then Mark and others.
[02:09:43.600 --> 02:09:49.440]  So stay with us, callers on the subject of ISIS, which is Saudi Arabia and backed.
[02:09:49.440 --> 02:09:50.960]  And we've got mainstream news articles.
[02:09:50.960 --> 02:09:54.920]  I told you this on Friday, but mainstream news articles of the weekend with think tanks
[02:09:54.920 --> 02:09:58.800]  going, yes, Saudi Arabia is financing through bases.
[02:09:58.800 --> 02:10:08.160]  They helped fund the NATO authorized in areas of southeastern Syria and the three year civil
[02:10:08.160 --> 02:10:13.360]  war there to now invade Iraq.
[02:10:13.360 --> 02:10:15.600]  And a lot of people say, well, we shouldn't be involved over there.
[02:10:15.600 --> 02:10:17.680]  And I morally say we shouldn't.
[02:10:17.680 --> 02:10:20.560]  The problem is, is that we are involved.
[02:10:20.560 --> 02:10:23.000]  This is a Western backed military.
[02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:28.360]  And that's why Obama is not droning them when the highways are filled for 20 miles with
[02:10:28.360 --> 02:10:30.360]  Al Qaeda flying Al Qaeda flags.
[02:10:30.360 --> 02:10:31.360]  That's what ISIS is.
[02:10:31.360 --> 02:10:32.360]  Look at the flag.
[02:10:32.360 --> 02:10:37.960]  It is the Al Qaeda Wahhabist flag that's admitted their Al Qaeda affiliate.
[02:10:37.960 --> 02:10:43.320]  This is a army and they've got heavy weapons, medium weapons saying they found them at base
[02:10:43.320 --> 02:10:44.320]  bases.
[02:10:44.320 --> 02:10:45.520]  They took no folks.
[02:10:45.520 --> 02:10:46.520]  No folks.
[02:10:46.520 --> 02:10:48.360]  They were given them by NATO.
[02:10:48.360 --> 02:10:49.800]  And Bruce Fine joins us.
[02:10:49.800 --> 02:10:55.120]  I really appreciate him coming on to talk about foreign policy and to look at Rand Paul's
[02:10:55.120 --> 02:11:03.240]  foreign policy versus the neocons and the Brzezinskiites in the Obama administration
[02:11:03.240 --> 02:11:08.200]  who are engaged in all this destabilization we see in Ukraine, Iraq, you name it.
[02:11:08.200 --> 02:11:13.240]  But we know what's going on.
[02:11:13.240 --> 02:11:15.200]  Looks like they backed Al Qaeda against Syria.
[02:11:15.200 --> 02:11:18.480]  The same thing's happening against the Iraqi government and they're about to overrun the
[02:11:18.480 --> 02:11:19.480]  bases.
[02:11:19.480 --> 02:11:20.600]  They're about to take Baghdad.
[02:11:20.600 --> 02:11:25.360]  I want to get Bruce Fine's take on that as we get into his two pieces he wrote for the
[02:11:25.360 --> 02:11:30.480]  Huffington Post in defense of Senator Rand Paul's foreign policy and then part two in
[02:11:30.480 --> 02:11:39.200]  defense of Rand Paul's foreign policy, breaking that down and looking at some of the Republicans
[02:11:39.200 --> 02:11:45.480]  and his words, Christian Zionist and people who some of the players are who are anti-Paul
[02:11:45.480 --> 02:11:49.400]  that stand in the way of him being president, hopefully coming up.
[02:11:49.400 --> 02:11:52.840]  He is the Republican frontrunner and I can't think of a better reason to bring this up
[02:11:52.840 --> 02:11:59.160]  but in the current light, Bruce, I mean, I know you're a constitutional lawyer, best
[02:11:59.160 --> 02:12:03.640]  selling author, adviser to Congressman Ron Paul and of course, Rand Paul and many others.
[02:12:03.640 --> 02:12:09.280]  And of course, at the FCC, help get rid of the fairness doctrine, we owe you for that,
[02:12:09.280 --> 02:12:10.680]  a big one.
[02:12:10.680 --> 02:12:15.240]  But instead of getting into your long bio here today, the listeners know who you are,
[02:12:15.240 --> 02:12:18.040]  what is your take on this?
[02:12:18.040 --> 02:12:21.760]  Because people say, well, let's not be involved in Iraq and I agree but since we were already
[02:12:21.760 --> 02:12:29.760]  there and now this ISIS group was set up in the attack on Syria, it's just amazing to
[02:12:29.760 --> 02:12:35.400]  see giant convoys of Al Qaeda about to take Baghdad and take that giant embassy as a Saudi
[02:12:35.400 --> 02:12:36.880]  Arabian takeover army.
[02:12:36.880 --> 02:12:44.160]  Well, it is but it's perhaps even more astonishing, Alex, having lived through the hostage crisis
[02:12:44.160 --> 02:12:49.640]  and being called the great Satan by Iran and the mullahs to now have us be collaborating
[02:12:49.640 --> 02:12:53.120]  with Iran against ISIS.
[02:12:53.120 --> 02:12:55.040]  Now where is our eye?
[02:12:55.040 --> 02:12:57.440]  Who do you think is going to be a greater danger?
[02:12:57.440 --> 02:13:01.720]  A country with possible nuclear capability or ISIS?
[02:13:01.720 --> 02:13:06.280]  It seems to me that if we want to stand back and look at the foreign policy in the long
[02:13:06.280 --> 02:13:11.480]  run, it can't be just in isolated instances, just think about how much better off we would
[02:13:11.480 --> 02:13:17.680]  have been if Rand Paul was in the White House in 2003 when the United States gratuitously
[02:13:17.680 --> 02:13:20.600]  invaded Iraq.
[02:13:20.600 --> 02:13:25.840]  The stupidity is rather staggering because Saddam Hussein, who we overthrew, was the
[02:13:25.840 --> 02:13:28.760]  greatest menace that Iran had ever confronted.
[02:13:28.760 --> 02:13:31.880]  He had fought eight-year war from 1980 to 88.
[02:13:31.880 --> 02:13:33.080]  He feared Iran.
[02:13:33.080 --> 02:13:39.480]  The Shia in Iran and the Sunnis who dominated at that time in the power structure in Iraq
[02:13:39.480 --> 02:13:42.120]  viewed each other's infidel.
[02:13:42.120 --> 02:13:49.240]  It was basically a defense of Iran without spending a single penny or risking a single
[02:13:49.240 --> 02:13:50.240]  American life.
[02:13:50.240 --> 02:13:53.600]  I mean, that's very seldom you come across such a sweep.
[02:13:53.600 --> 02:13:54.840]  It was a balance of power.
[02:13:54.840 --> 02:13:55.840]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:13:55.840 --> 02:13:58.080]  And it wasn't threatening the United States.
[02:13:58.080 --> 02:13:59.240]  What's the weapon?
[02:13:59.240 --> 02:14:04.760]  So why would Rand Paul would have just resisted, refrained from doing things?
[02:14:04.760 --> 02:14:08.120]  It's what the British called masterly inactivity.
[02:14:08.120 --> 02:14:10.240]  Why do anything?
[02:14:10.240 --> 02:14:15.040]  If you have your adversaries at each other's throats, you don't need to do anything.
[02:14:15.040 --> 02:14:17.640]  It could only make it worse.
[02:14:17.640 --> 02:14:24.000]  And the fact is, once we went in, we spent well over a trillion dollars, 5,000 soldiers'
[02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:28.520]  lives lost on our side, hundreds of thousands that wounded, now one of the reasons why we
[02:14:28.520 --> 02:14:30.880]  have the VA problem.
[02:14:30.880 --> 02:14:32.680]  And what did we get out of it?
[02:14:32.680 --> 02:14:33.680]  Nothing.
[02:14:33.680 --> 02:14:37.520]  We didn't really gain anything, even on the human rights level.
[02:14:37.520 --> 02:14:41.160]  We started out with Saddam Hussein, who was clearly an atrocious ruler.
[02:14:41.160 --> 02:14:44.920]  He gassed the Kurds and he used chemical weapons against Iran.
[02:14:44.920 --> 02:14:50.520]  But look who's successors who are there now at our behest, Mr. Al-Maliki, a sectarian
[02:14:50.520 --> 02:14:55.560]  Shia who has created chaos throughout the country, the Sunni opponents are equally dogmatic
[02:14:55.560 --> 02:14:56.960]  and dictatorial.
[02:14:56.960 --> 02:15:02.320]  The Kurds also, they're cult figures in Barzani and Taliban that are running in the north.
[02:15:02.320 --> 02:15:05.120]  You have three small dictators from one big one.
[02:15:05.120 --> 02:15:06.920]  What is the great gain in human rights?
[02:15:06.920 --> 02:15:08.720]  Virtually nothing.
[02:15:08.720 --> 02:15:11.800]  So think of how much better we would be.
[02:15:11.800 --> 02:15:17.560]  We would have had enough savings, Alex, to fund or not spend anything on the so-called
[02:15:17.560 --> 02:15:23.440]  bailout of George Bush and the stimulus program of Barack Obama, trillions of dollars if we
[02:15:23.440 --> 02:15:31.560]  had just refrained from this extravagant waste of money and men's and women's life for nothing.
[02:15:31.560 --> 02:15:34.920]  Now you ask, what should we do now?
[02:15:34.920 --> 02:15:37.200]  Because we can't redo history.
[02:15:37.200 --> 02:15:41.200]  And I think in asking that question, we need to even rethink about the Middle East and
[02:15:41.200 --> 02:15:42.840]  the boundaries there.
[02:15:42.840 --> 02:15:48.440]  Human relics, the boundaries from those countries are totally and completely artificial.
[02:15:48.440 --> 02:15:54.600]  They were drawn after World War I when the Ottoman Empire was carved up and it was collapsed
[02:15:54.600 --> 02:15:56.760]  at the Treaty of Versailles.
[02:15:56.760 --> 02:15:59.840]  And so there isn't any rhyme or reason for these boundaries.
[02:15:59.840 --> 02:16:06.520]  They don't follow religious homogeneity, linguistic homogeneity, cultural or historical homogeneity.
[02:16:06.520 --> 02:16:09.240]  We can't, the United States can't unilaterally change that.
[02:16:09.240 --> 02:16:12.160]  That's why you have, you're going to have some instability there.
[02:16:12.160 --> 02:16:14.360]  No matter what happens.
[02:16:14.360 --> 02:16:20.280]  And we need to have the humility to recognize, even though we never revel in other people's
[02:16:20.280 --> 02:16:25.120]  tragedies, we can't do anything other than make a mess of things and create danger to
[02:16:25.120 --> 02:16:26.120]  us.
[02:16:26.120 --> 02:16:30.240]  And one of the things we fail to recognize, because power and international relations
[02:16:30.240 --> 02:16:33.880]  is unsentimental, we go in and support anybody.
[02:16:33.880 --> 02:16:38.360]  And I don't know who we'd support in Iraq at President Alex, who is there, you know?
[02:16:38.360 --> 02:16:40.320]  That's a friend worthy of support.
[02:16:40.320 --> 02:16:45.800]  We end up with an ingrate like Hamid Karzai, and then all of the opponents of the ingrate
[02:16:45.800 --> 02:16:46.800]  become our enemy.
[02:16:46.800 --> 02:16:51.800]  But it makes money for the military industrial complex to sell weapons just into any black
[02:16:51.800 --> 02:16:53.360]  hole and have no bid contracts.
[02:16:53.360 --> 02:16:54.880]  That's why this never seems to end.
[02:16:54.880 --> 02:17:00.000]  Let's break down your defense of the Rand Paul foreign policy for folks that don't know
[02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:03.560]  what it is, because it's being misrepresented by the control medium.
[02:17:03.560 --> 02:17:04.560]  Yes.
[02:17:04.560 --> 02:17:11.120]  And what they try to suggest is that Rand Paul is a so-called isolationist.
[02:17:11.120 --> 02:17:12.920]  He doesn't want to stand ambassadors.
[02:17:12.920 --> 02:17:15.560]  He doesn't want to have intelligence collection.
[02:17:15.560 --> 02:17:19.920]  He doesn't want to have trade, which is all complete nonsense.
[02:17:19.920 --> 02:17:24.440]  The reason why, Alex, it's very critical when you think about foreign policy to focus
[02:17:24.440 --> 02:17:28.440]  on war and why people say, well, why is war such a big deal?
[02:17:28.440 --> 02:17:33.600]  It's a big deal because it makes what's ordinarily first degree murder legal.
[02:17:33.600 --> 02:17:34.600]  It's a huge issue.
[02:17:34.600 --> 02:17:35.600]  It creates resentment.
[02:17:35.600 --> 02:17:36.840]  Sometimes you have to do it.
[02:17:36.840 --> 02:17:39.040]  You know, after Pearl Harbor, we have to fight back.
[02:17:39.040 --> 02:17:41.360]  But it should be a very exacting line.
[02:17:41.360 --> 02:17:45.520]  And we should only fight risk our soldiers' lives for us.
[02:17:45.520 --> 02:17:47.720]  Other people abroad, they don't pay taxes.
[02:17:47.720 --> 02:17:48.720]  They don't pay.
[02:17:48.720 --> 02:17:49.720]  They don't obey our laws.
[02:17:49.720 --> 02:17:51.760]  They don't any loyalty to us.
[02:17:51.760 --> 02:17:56.320]  We have no moral or other obligation to defend them, just like they don't us.
[02:17:56.320 --> 02:18:01.440]  And Rand Paul is for, I think, the foreign policy can be captured in the phrase, billions
[02:18:01.440 --> 02:18:04.040]  for defense, not one cent for empire.
[02:18:04.040 --> 02:18:05.040]  Why?
[02:18:05.040 --> 02:18:10.120]  If you're going, Alex, distinct, you're approaching a family whose son or daughter died in Afghanistan.
[02:18:10.120 --> 02:18:14.640]  But when you're trying to explain what they died for, you know, couldn't you tell them?
[02:18:14.640 --> 02:18:16.160]  You know, you'd be speechless.
[02:18:16.160 --> 02:18:17.320]  You know, we don't even know.
[02:18:17.320 --> 02:18:20.640]  What did we accomplish in Afghanistan after all these years?
[02:18:20.640 --> 02:18:25.080]  All the people who were implicated in the direct attack of 9-11, we've killed them or
[02:18:25.080 --> 02:18:26.080]  captured them.
[02:18:26.080 --> 02:18:30.520]  Well, I think that's the bottom line is all the warmongers are so discredited and are
[02:18:30.520 --> 02:18:38.440]  so obviously just profiteering, but they set up there with this moral high ground.
[02:18:38.440 --> 02:18:43.120]  How do we discredit them and then endorse the ideas of somebody like yourself or Rand
[02:18:43.120 --> 02:18:44.120]  Paul?
[02:18:44.120 --> 02:18:48.480]  Well, just to expose it, I don't think that it takes a whole lot of convincing.
[02:18:48.480 --> 02:18:53.800]  It's just having people like you who are willing to give the people a different voice than
[02:18:53.800 --> 02:18:55.520]  the echo chamber out of Washington.
[02:18:55.520 --> 02:19:00.560]  Oh, yeah, if we don't fight there, then we'll be fighting a caliphate in Washington DC.
[02:19:00.560 --> 02:19:04.440]  All these staggering exaggerations that that.
[02:19:04.440 --> 02:19:09.480]  But meanwhile, the caliphate is taking over Iraq and it's doing them with arms given to
[02:19:09.480 --> 02:19:11.400]  them to attack Syria.
[02:19:11.400 --> 02:19:15.240]  And then I go to the airport, in fact, there's a new photo in that we're going to cover when
[02:19:15.240 --> 02:19:22.560]  we come back, a Vern Troyer, the famous little person who's in Austin Powers playing Minimi
[02:19:22.560 --> 02:19:30.360]  literally having TSA stick their hands down the back of his pants and search him.
[02:19:30.360 --> 02:19:33.400]  But meanwhile, illegal aliens are pouring across by the millions.
[02:19:33.400 --> 02:19:37.080]  I want to come back and ask you what's going on in this country.
[02:19:37.080 --> 02:19:42.880]  I mean, it does seem like total insanity by the power structure right now, folks, where
[02:19:42.880 --> 02:19:48.840]  if you're a well-known movie star, TSA is going to literally check in your butt crack.
[02:19:48.840 --> 02:19:49.840]  I'm sorry.
[02:19:49.840 --> 02:19:50.840]  That's the photo.
[02:19:50.840 --> 02:19:53.840]  He released it with him bent over a table.
[02:19:53.840 --> 02:20:00.200]  I mean, he's in a wheelchair, obviously has medical problems.
[02:20:00.200 --> 02:20:04.920]  To have a fighting chance against cold and flu bugs, get the world's best garlic extract,

[02:23:11.760 --> 02:23:16.720]  Genetically modified crops, processed foods, and toxic chemicals can compromise your health
[02:23:16.720 --> 02:23:21.400]  and are silently destroying your digestive system, which accounts for 80% of your immune

[02:24:32.240 --> 02:24:38.320]  Constitutional lawyer Ron Paul, Rand Paul, advisor Bruce Fine is our guest.
[02:24:38.320 --> 02:24:43.440]  BruceFineLaw.com isn't up yet, but in the next few weeks it's his new revamp website
[02:24:43.440 --> 02:24:44.640]  will be up.
[02:24:44.640 --> 02:24:48.880]  You can also find his latest book, Dealing with the Empire, and it's a collapse, I'll
[02:24:48.880 --> 02:24:50.560]  tell you about that in a moment.
[02:24:50.560 --> 02:24:54.360]  Bruce, it shows how out of control the establishment is.
[02:24:54.360 --> 02:25:00.120]  They try to create this artificial reality that it's kooky to not want to print or invade
[02:25:00.120 --> 02:25:01.640]  a bunch of countries.
[02:25:01.640 --> 02:25:08.800]  When Rand Paul talks, he sounds like JFK or he sounds like Ronald Reagan.
[02:25:08.800 --> 02:25:13.080]  I mean, those guys weren't offensively out launching a bunch of wars.
[02:25:13.080 --> 02:25:17.400]  I mean, the good guys never offensively launch a war, and then like you said, you can't even
[02:25:17.400 --> 02:25:22.640]  say what all these wars have done except clear the way for Saudi Arabia to take over the
[02:25:22.640 --> 02:25:23.640]  Middle East.
[02:25:23.640 --> 02:25:29.960]  And I think in the final equation, I think it's Saudi Arabia, even more than Israel.
[02:25:29.960 --> 02:25:33.200]  I know you mentioned that in your article and I'm not defending some of Israel's war
[02:25:33.200 --> 02:25:38.600]  promotion, but there's a bunch of special interests here that want the U.S. in the business
[02:25:38.600 --> 02:25:40.960]  of empire because we're paying for it.
[02:25:40.960 --> 02:25:44.160]  Hey, let the Germans pay for all their military.
[02:25:44.160 --> 02:25:45.600]  Let the British pay.
[02:25:45.600 --> 02:25:46.600]  We're going bankrupt.
[02:25:46.600 --> 02:25:49.200]  I mean, isn't that the Rand Paul farm policy?
[02:25:49.200 --> 02:25:50.200]  Well, yeah.
[02:25:50.200 --> 02:25:52.000]  And I think it goes back to George Washington.
[02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:53.480]  No entangling alliances.
[02:25:53.480 --> 02:25:57.360]  The fact is you just you're able to recite all the mischief there.
[02:25:57.360 --> 02:26:01.560]  Saudi Arabia, Iran, Syria, Jordan, they all have their own agendas.
[02:26:01.560 --> 02:26:02.680]  Israel has its own agendas.
[02:26:02.680 --> 02:26:03.920]  We should expect that.
[02:26:03.920 --> 02:26:08.160]  They're doing what they're doing for their good, not for the good of the United States.
[02:26:08.160 --> 02:26:13.640]  And so we need to go back to the most famous capture, I think, of U.S. foreign policy was
[02:26:13.640 --> 02:26:18.200]  John Quincy Adams, who was really part of the founding generation when he was Secretary
[02:26:18.200 --> 02:26:23.360]  of State in the message to Congress that we wish freedom and liberty well abroad.
[02:26:23.360 --> 02:26:29.200]  We fight only to defend our own, that our force abroad has got to be the force of example.
[02:26:29.200 --> 02:26:34.680]  But when we resort to force and risking lives, that last full measure of devotion is to defend
[02:26:34.680 --> 02:26:37.280]  the United States against attack.
[02:26:37.280 --> 02:26:43.400]  And indeed, when you review the constitutional convention and the idea of war, every person
[02:26:43.400 --> 02:26:48.680]  spoke of it in terms of defending against an attack, not racing around the world like
[02:26:48.680 --> 02:26:51.520]  Julius Caesar, I came, I saw, I conquered.
[02:26:51.520 --> 02:26:56.400]  And you remember Reagan famously withdrew our troops from Lebanon when he saw that they
[02:26:56.400 --> 02:27:00.040]  were just sitting ducks and couldn't accomplish anything.
[02:27:00.040 --> 02:27:05.080]  And these arguments are not to be callous towards human rights violations abroad.
[02:27:05.080 --> 02:27:09.240]  It's just recognizing the limits of what our own power is.
[02:27:09.240 --> 02:27:14.040]  And we make it worse, and we endanger our own liberties because in the process, Alex,
[02:27:14.040 --> 02:27:19.280]  of going abroad in search of monsters to destroy, we endow the president with virtually limitless
[02:27:19.280 --> 02:27:20.280]  power.
[02:27:20.280 --> 02:27:24.880]  Just think of the speechlessness of the founding fathers, if they were told, the president
[02:27:24.880 --> 02:27:30.520]  of the United States today, not King George III, who we overthrew in 1776, the president
[02:27:30.520 --> 02:27:35.800]  of the United States today claims authority to kill anybody he wants on the planet based
[02:27:35.800 --> 02:27:40.040]  on secret evidence that he alone looks at with no outside review.
[02:27:40.040 --> 02:27:45.960]  Well, let's, exactly, let's go back to Hillary saying three years ago when Gaddafi died,
[02:27:45.960 --> 02:27:48.360]  we came, we saw he died.
[02:27:48.360 --> 02:27:53.520]  I mean, even top generals or dictators of the past didn't act like that.
[02:27:53.520 --> 02:27:58.600]  There's really a childish disconnect, I think, because so many of these politicians have
[02:27:58.600 --> 02:28:03.120]  no military background or something, I don't know what it is, but they just act like crazy
[02:28:03.120 --> 02:28:05.480]  people to make statements like that.
[02:28:05.480 --> 02:28:07.960]  They do, and you think she could make that statement?
[02:28:07.960 --> 02:28:12.000]  The reason why we had Benghazi and our ambassador was killed was why?
[02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:17.480]  Because people like Hillary promoted the gratuitous U.S. war to throw out Gaddafi.
[02:28:17.480 --> 02:28:21.440]  And remember this, he was the one who renounced the weapons of mass destruction.
[02:28:21.440 --> 02:28:25.400]  So think of the signal Hillary Clinton sent to Iran and North Korea.
[02:28:25.400 --> 02:28:29.600]  If you abandon WMD, you end up like Gaddafi, being overthrown and killed.
[02:28:29.600 --> 02:28:35.240]  Can you imagine anything more stupid than that when we're trying to negotiate a denuclearization
[02:28:35.240 --> 02:28:36.240]  of their program?
[02:28:36.240 --> 02:28:43.440]  Well, they now admit that Libya is 10 times worse than it was, and let me ask you this
[02:28:43.440 --> 02:28:44.440]  question.
[02:28:44.440 --> 02:28:46.800]  I know you're busy only doing five more months on the other side and talking more about your
[02:28:46.800 --> 02:28:51.800]  articles and I haven't composed the people should read of the mindset of MPAR versus
[02:28:51.800 --> 02:28:55.560]  celebrity, then we will go to Mark and Chad and others that are patiently holding after
[02:28:55.560 --> 02:28:56.560]  Bruce leaves us.
[02:28:56.560 --> 02:28:59.920]  So stay with us, callers, but think about this question and starting answering it now
[02:28:59.920 --> 02:29:00.920]  if you can.
[02:29:00.920 --> 02:29:03.560]  So I'm going to come back and elaborate on it.
[02:29:03.560 --> 02:29:07.960]  There is something in history with leaders when they go megalomaniacal crazy.
[02:29:07.960 --> 02:29:14.760]  Do you think it's a disconnect in the ruling class or do you think it is some type of megalomania
[02:29:14.760 --> 02:29:20.440]  that is making them historically act like classical comic book bad guys?
[02:29:20.440 --> 02:29:25.920]  So stay there, Tony Bruce Fine, I want to get your take as a constitutional lawyer and
[02:29:25.920 --> 02:29:30.480]  as a historian on that final question and other tidbits out of your excellent two-part
[02:29:30.480 --> 02:29:36.760]  article at the Huffington Post in defense of Senator Rand Paul's foreign policy and
[02:29:36.760 --> 02:29:41.480]  we're going to put links to these articles up on infowars.com so that these articles
[02:29:41.480 --> 02:29:42.760]  get attention out there.
[02:29:42.760 --> 02:29:48.560]  It is important to talk about the only Republican running who isn't a total warmonger.
[02:29:48.560 --> 02:29:52.280]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:52.280 --> 02:29:55.560]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:55.560 --> 02:30:03.680]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[02:30:03.680 --> 02:30:08.080]  This year alone over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminate.
[02:30:08.080 --> 02:30:11.680]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[02:30:11.680 --> 02:30:14.600]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[02:30:14.600 --> 02:30:18.560]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect
[02:30:18.560 --> 02:30:22.240]  you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[02:30:22.240 --> 02:30:26.240]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[02:30:26.240 --> 02:30:30.760]  Hue filters cut out the glyphosates that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[02:30:30.760 --> 02:30:35.960]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosalic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[02:30:35.960 --> 02:30:40.240]  Fluoride is in teats and coffins and waters and breads and toothpaste.
[02:30:40.240 --> 02:30:44.800]  It is our responsibility to protect our families, the establishment's not going to do it.
[02:30:44.800 --> 02:30:48.160]  It's time to take action, it's time to filter our water.

[02:30:59.880 --> 02:31:05.240]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more
[02:31:05.240 --> 02:31:09.560]  toxic each and every day, but it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:31:09.560 --> 02:31:13.400]  Our air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants
[02:31:13.400 --> 02:31:18.240]  than even outdoor air, and most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic
[02:31:18.240 --> 02:31:19.800]  chemicals within their homes.
[02:31:19.800 --> 02:31:23.200]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:31:23.200 --> 02:31:27.720]  Well over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions, and don't forget
[02:31:27.720 --> 02:31:31.320]  the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:31:31.320 --> 02:31:35.840]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing
[02:31:35.840 --> 02:31:40.840]  my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight
[02:31:40.840 --> 02:31:41.840]  back against.
[02:31:41.840 --> 02:31:46.920]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars
[02:31:46.920 --> 02:31:51.280]  Life Lung Cleans is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout
[02:31:51.280 --> 02:31:52.600]  any toxic environment.

[02:31:58.680 --> 02:32:02.880]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Groot.
[02:32:02.880 --> 02:32:08.520]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity
[02:32:08.520 --> 02:32:10.320]  iodine available.
[02:32:10.320 --> 02:32:18.760]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7 to 10,000 feet below the Earth in pristine
[02:32:18.760 --> 02:32:21.160]  environmentally clean conditions.
[02:32:21.160 --> 02:32:29.360]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit
[02:32:29.360 --> 02:32:30.640]  deep in the Earth.
[02:32:30.640 --> 02:32:35.160]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[02:32:35.160 --> 02:32:39.480]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[02:32:39.480 --> 02:32:41.600]  Experience the new formula.
[02:32:41.600 --> 02:32:43.840]  Experience the ancient purity.
[02:32:43.840 --> 02:32:45.320]  Shield your family.
[02:32:45.320 --> 02:32:49.920]  Survival Shield X2, available now at infowarslife.com.

[02:33:16.920 --> 02:33:21.960]  Rallying Patriots Worldwide in Defense of Human Liberty.
[02:33:21.960 --> 02:33:24.240]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:24.240 --> 02:33:33.400]  All right, final segment with Bruce Fine and I'm going to write your calls to the folks
[02:33:33.400 --> 02:33:35.960]  that are patiently holding.
[02:33:35.960 --> 02:33:39.200]  Also CJ running the board and producing in there.
[02:33:39.200 --> 02:33:43.440]  His brother's a little person.
[02:33:43.440 --> 02:33:49.600]  Like the actor that plays many me in Boston Powers who's released a photo on his Facebook
[02:33:49.600 --> 02:33:54.480]  that will show here in a moment where they literally went in the back of his pants at
[02:33:54.480 --> 02:33:59.120]  the airport and I've heard CJ talk about the stuff they do to his brother.
[02:33:59.120 --> 02:34:04.960]  And then it turns out Buckley, my cousin that works here actually knows Vern Troyer this
[02:34:04.960 --> 02:34:12.840]  happened to so I'd love to get many me of Dr. Evil on the show just to illustrate all
[02:34:12.840 --> 02:34:13.840]  of this.
[02:34:13.840 --> 02:34:22.400]  And my point is the illegals, again the churches are advertising on NPR, send money, give money,
[02:34:22.400 --> 02:34:25.880]  they're paying to get them here on buses, then they stage them at the churches and deploy
[02:34:25.880 --> 02:34:29.440]  them all over the country to be Democratic voters.
[02:34:29.440 --> 02:34:34.800]  Using the fact that we've got collectivism here to buy them off as voters.
[02:34:34.800 --> 02:34:41.040]  Oh, you'll vote for socialism, gun control will give you money.
[02:34:41.040 --> 02:34:44.600]  And my issue is we do need more workers in this country, we've aborted 53 million of
[02:34:44.600 --> 02:34:49.880]  our kids so I'm not against skilled workers or hardworking workers coming in but that's
[02:34:49.880 --> 02:34:55.320]  not the reform they're pushing, they're pushing just totally letting anybody in to further
[02:34:55.320 --> 02:34:59.800]  bankrupt and Bruce, I really want to get back into world politics and that question I was
[02:34:59.800 --> 02:35:04.640]  asking you geopolitically about the elite and our mindset but this ties into the lawlessness.
[02:35:04.640 --> 02:35:08.240]  If I fly with my children they want to pull them aside and grope them at the airport and
[02:35:08.240 --> 02:35:13.000]  put them in naked body scammers and treat me like a terrorist while al-Qaeda groups
[02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:18.840]  are being fined to attack Syria and they're searching well-known movie stars at the airport
[02:35:18.840 --> 02:35:23.320]  sticking their hands down their pants and then meanwhile the illegals, the border patrol
[02:35:23.320 --> 02:35:28.400]  has been told stand down but then I go through border patrol checkpoints 100 miles in when
[02:35:28.400 --> 02:35:34.920]  I haven't even left the US and I swear when I'm a US citizen they want to search my vehicle.
[02:35:34.920 --> 02:35:39.360]  So they're using it as a power grab, what is happening with all this selective enforcement?
[02:35:39.360 --> 02:35:47.480]  It ties in to just the lawlessness of the state, I mean what's happening?
[02:35:47.480 --> 02:35:51.080]  What is the spirit of just craziness I see?
[02:35:51.080 --> 02:35:52.360]  Is it coming to a head?
[02:35:52.360 --> 02:35:53.760]  Is it a cycle?
[02:35:53.760 --> 02:35:55.000]  Are we just more aware of it?
[02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:56.000]  What's happening?
[02:35:56.000 --> 02:36:00.640]  Well during, I call this psychology of empire is one of limitless executive power and it's
[02:36:00.640 --> 02:36:06.760]  subordinates everything from even the appearance of something that smacks of safety and liberty
[02:36:06.760 --> 02:36:12.560]  is subordinated very readily to a claim of safety even when it's ridiculous for example
[02:36:12.560 --> 02:36:19.440]  the TSA has acknowledged it's supported zero terrorist plot ever since it began and yet
[02:36:19.440 --> 02:36:20.440]  it continues on.
[02:36:20.440 --> 02:36:29.640]  I go on Amtrak regularly on the northeast and there's never any searches whatsoever and
[02:36:29.640 --> 02:36:33.800]  there's never been any terrorism at all so what's going on here?
[02:36:33.800 --> 02:36:39.680]  How come Amtrak record is the same as the TSA and Amtrak isn't destroying our privacy
[02:36:39.680 --> 02:36:43.640]  and liberty every time we go on a train?
[02:36:43.640 --> 02:36:52.040]  But it is characteristic of empires to become exceptionally sensitive to the idea of a risk
[02:36:52.040 --> 02:36:58.120]  free existence, become arrogant in that score and when you search for risk free existence
[02:36:58.120 --> 02:37:03.840]  you then become vassals and serfs to a Leviathan government and you'll accept everything
[02:37:03.840 --> 02:37:10.640]  it's like the surveillance programs of the NSA, the search programs of TSA, the willingness
[02:37:10.640 --> 02:37:16.320]  of the American people to permit the president to go abroad in search of monsters to destroy
[02:37:16.320 --> 02:37:21.480]  a claim power to use predator drones anywhere he wishes, kill anybody he wishes, all he
[02:37:21.480 --> 02:37:26.360]  says in the name of safety but in fact the irony Alex is it makes us less safe.
[02:37:26.360 --> 02:37:31.080]  We give weapons, we prop up countries like Afghanistan, we make one ingrate the recipient
[02:37:31.080 --> 02:37:35.600]  I mean Hamid Karzai the president of Afghanistan would blast us every day even when he's on
[02:37:35.600 --> 02:37:41.080]  the CIA payroll and we make hundreds of thousands of new enemies, namely the people who are
[02:37:41.080 --> 02:37:48.000]  all opposed to the ingrate so it's a lose-lose situation it in fact makes us less safe but
[02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:53.240]  it is this illusion of safety that justifies this limitless executive power and you're
[02:37:53.240 --> 02:37:59.440]  talking about why is it that those who are the power elite continue to fight these ridiculous
[02:37:59.440 --> 02:38:04.600]  wars is it make Romania and the fact is it is, it's power for the sake of power think
[02:38:04.600 --> 02:38:09.040]  of the stupidity of Napoleon going to Moscow I mean what did he do that he lost two million
[02:38:09.040 --> 02:38:14.080]  of his army had to burn the city down or Hitler declaring war on Stalin or the Japanese
[02:38:14.080 --> 02:38:19.160]  attacking us at Pearl Harbor these are utterly ridiculous decisions made but when you have
[02:38:19.160 --> 02:38:24.080]  that kind of authority and you have this we're the only superpower you make utterly ridiculous
[02:38:24.080 --> 02:38:29.520]  decisions just because you feel that you can do it it's sort of the bully on the playground
[02:38:29.520 --> 02:38:33.600]  flexing his muscles and that's what makes it so disgraceful they aren't even doing
[02:38:33.600 --> 02:38:40.160]  it to help the United States it's just to make their ego satisfied and propitiated.
[02:38:40.160 --> 02:38:46.000]  Well I know this the two-party is winning almost every primary right now and every libertarian
[02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:51.880]  conservative I know is sick of war sick of all this garbage so are the Democrats and
[02:38:51.880 --> 02:38:57.960]  I wish we could all just come together and restore basic rule of law basic freedom but
[02:38:57.960 --> 02:39:02.800]  if the Republican Party does not get wise and join with Rand Paul and others in trying
[02:39:02.800 --> 02:39:08.200]  to reform themselves I shudder to think where it's all going and closing what do you expect
[02:39:08.200 --> 02:39:13.240]  to happen if we're not able to get a Rand Paul elected he is the Republican Party front
[02:39:13.240 --> 02:39:17.040]  runner but we're still a while out from that.
[02:39:17.040 --> 02:39:24.160]  I view Rand as the you know the last great hope of the country if we don't elect a Rand
[02:39:24.160 --> 02:39:31.240]  Paul president 2016 I can guarantee you that within 20 or 30 years we will have a one branch
[02:39:31.240 --> 02:39:37.080]  executive government that operates in secrecy will be involved in perpetual warfare will
[02:39:37.080 --> 02:39:43.360]  be bankrupting ourselves and we will lose the republic we think you have surveillance
[02:39:43.360 --> 02:39:50.560]  problems now you can think Alex at how rapidly technology is moving to enable the government
[02:39:50.560 --> 02:39:54.920]  to spy with greater and greater intensity on our lives now they're gathering pictures
[02:39:54.920 --> 02:40:00.800]  of us as well as our conversation our telephone data and without a Rand Paul in there all
[02:40:00.800 --> 02:40:07.320]  the other candidates are willing to support the Leviathan state that's not what we sacrificed
[02:40:07.320 --> 02:40:14.320]  for at Valley Forge Cemetery Ridge Omaha Beach and it would be a true tragedy if we didn't
[02:40:14.320 --> 02:40:20.120]  have the strength to avoid squandering all the liberty that was won by these great wise
[02:40:20.120 --> 02:40:26.080]  and courageous people and our posterity inherent some kind of tyranny I mean history will extricate
[02:40:26.080 --> 02:40:30.600]  this generation if we permit liberty to slip out of our hands when it's happening right
[02:40:30.600 --> 02:40:34.720]  in front of our feet Bruce fine thank you for the time great articles at the Hovegan
[02:40:34.720 --> 02:40:39.400]  Post I'm glad they published them we'll talk again soon thank you Alex there goes attorney
[02:40:39.400 --> 02:40:46.600]  Bruce fine I just thought we should discuss the role of our nation in a republic versus
[02:40:46.600 --> 02:40:51.920]  an empire and again it'd be bad enough if we had an empire and but as citizens we were
[02:40:51.920 --> 02:40:59.360]  actually getting something out of it like the Roman Empire or even the British Empire
[02:40:59.360 --> 02:41:04.760]  we pay for everything and then get big debts and the blame for it this is not helping us
[02:41:04.760 --> 02:41:11.360]  people say we have an empire in the Middle East to get their oil to get the oil companies
[02:41:11.360 --> 02:41:16.880]  the oil so they can sell it to Europe and the Chinese that oil doesn't really come here
[02:41:16.880 --> 02:41:22.600]  compared to the other nations they shut down our oil exploration for 50 years as part of
[02:41:22.600 --> 02:41:29.120]  that deal we have more oil in Alaska than Saudi Arabia has that's now admitted I had
[02:41:29.120 --> 02:41:34.760]  guessed on 15 years ago exposing that now it's mainstream news that guys I forgot I
[02:41:34.760 --> 02:41:39.240]  saw a report over the weekend where they discovered there's more water three times more water
[02:41:39.240 --> 02:41:46.240]  under the earth surface in the mammal and the crust and there is above it and that the oceans
[02:41:46.240 --> 02:41:52.800]  are really controlled by that sub dermal I guess you could call it water which is what
[02:41:52.800 --> 02:41:58.880]  the Bible says but the waters out of the deep and of course that's been known for a long
[02:41:58.880 --> 02:42:08.640]  time and there's an aquifer the size of Texas under Texas and this is what we don't even
[02:42:08.640 --> 02:42:13.160]  know one-tenth the secrets of our own planet they're finding new species all the time there's
[02:42:13.160 --> 02:42:18.320]  so much wonderment and I'll tell you why I've been bummed out that I'm going to your calls
[02:42:18.320 --> 02:42:23.840]  it's because humanity has so much potential and is so good and there's so much wonderment
[02:42:23.840 --> 02:42:28.680]  and and discovery all around us and I care about every man woman and child in this planet
[02:42:28.680 --> 02:42:34.000]  I don't care what color you are and the worst people in the world that have it out for everybody
[02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:42.160]  are the ones that use all this bleeding heart manipulation to control the population and
[02:42:42.160 --> 02:42:47.840]  I don't like having to focus on the globalist I mean let me tell you something I look at
[02:42:47.840 --> 02:42:55.680]  Joe Biden with his you know what eating grin and just all his con artistry and how these
[02:42:55.680 --> 02:43:07.160]  guys think they're so slick I get physically angry TSA wants to grab my genitals man I
[02:43:07.160 --> 02:43:15.560]  get mad not just that they want to violate me it's all a hoax I'm gonna go to your calls
[02:43:15.560 --> 02:43:20.680]  but I said I'd do this I want to talk about Vern Troyer we have the image we'll put it
[02:43:20.680 --> 02:43:26.720]  up on screen because an image does say a thousand words a picture says a thousand words he's
[02:43:26.720 --> 02:43:34.440]  a well-known one of the best-known little people I guess he would technically be a dwarf I
[02:43:34.440 --> 02:43:38.160]  guess a midget has proportion of the right size a dwarf doesn't has a lot more health
[02:43:38.160 --> 02:43:43.960]  problems and I think dwarves are more common aren't they than little people the point is
[02:43:43.960 --> 02:43:51.560]  I mean than midgets Vern Troyer post cheeky pick of being searched by TSA agent while
[02:43:51.560 --> 02:43:57.820]  security reps say screening was standard procedure well as long as it's standard to have someone
[02:43:57.820 --> 02:44:02.680]  binge you over and stick their hand down the back of your pants to see what's in your
[02:44:02.680 --> 02:44:09.480]  butt crack and I got he doesn't look like he's doing too good physically there she still
[02:44:09.480 --> 02:44:14.160]  have his legs there in that photo I know they have a lot of health problem for a little
[02:44:14.160 --> 02:44:22.000]  guy there's there's many me's but in so many movies many me of Dr. Evil and then look next
[02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:27.400]  to it you have the Royals dressed up in their royal outfits I'm gonna vomit man you got
[02:44:27.400 --> 02:44:31.240]  these people that are above the law nobody searches them because they stole a bunch people's
[02:44:31.240 --> 02:44:37.240]  money like Kim Jong Un third-generation dictator he's now starting to wear crowns you know fancy
[02:44:37.240 --> 02:44:42.320]  headdresses that's what happens you're a dictator the first generation or did care of the second
[02:44:42.320 --> 02:44:48.400]  the third and fourth year God no Kim Jong Un is not God he's a piece of garbage she got
[02:44:48.400 --> 02:44:54.360]  this poor little person having some TSA agent check his pants his underwear people's babies
[02:44:54.360 --> 02:45:03.360]  diapers are getting searched CJ and then we're going to the calls up what happens to your
[02:45:03.360 --> 02:45:09.560]  brother well like most little people my brother uses a couple different pieces of equipment
[02:45:09.560 --> 02:45:15.720]  to get around because he has mobility issues and the wheelchair and the Walker kind of immediate
[02:45:15.720 --> 02:45:24.000]  alarm for the TSA and they'll dust him and all of his equipment with bomb detecting detecting
[02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:27.920]  powder or or liquid depending on what they have sure sure what type of little person
[02:45:27.920 --> 02:45:32.560]  as your brother he has a stiostrophic display so he's quite smaller than someone like Verne
[02:45:32.560 --> 02:45:37.840]  Troyer really yeah he's extremely small and and of course there's probably no history
[02:45:37.840 --> 02:45:41.920]  of a little person doing anything criminal like that but it doesn't matter again this
[02:45:41.920 --> 02:45:45.880]  is this is political correctness everyone's treated like a terrorist in America except
[02:45:45.880 --> 02:45:48.840]  the terrorists right to my knowledge there's never been a little person involved in any
[02:45:48.840 --> 02:45:53.120]  terrorist activity in the United States whatsoever probably financial because they're exactly
[02:45:53.120 --> 02:45:58.160]  profiling them you're not going to see a bunch of little people commandos you know al-qaeda
[02:45:58.160 --> 02:46:03.080]  no no no I mean the real al-qaeda is being funded by our government right and it's not
[02:46:03.080 --> 02:46:08.160]  that they're physically violating him but you know because he already has to have help
[02:46:08.160 --> 02:46:13.920]  to get to the bathroom being of his stature and length of his arms but to have him digging
[02:46:13.920 --> 02:46:18.960]  his pants all the time is just embarrassing it's not something anybody move any how old
[02:46:18.960 --> 02:46:23.520]  your brother he's only ten wow it's still it's embarrassing we ought to get him in
[02:46:23.520 --> 02:46:28.320]  studio sometime when he's down here I like to you're a really nice guy but your brother's
[02:46:28.320 --> 02:46:37.560]  a nice guy yes yes but I mean imagine imagine in America they train us to look in our pants
[02:46:37.560 --> 02:46:44.320]  I mean we're pathetic land of the free home of the brave what a joke it's false advertising
[02:46:44.320 --> 02:46:50.440]  sorry everybody's got to do it to stay safe bull the people that run the government stage
[02:46:50.440 --> 02:46:55.320]  9-11 they run al-qaeda you know that Saudi Arabians don't have to get searched when they
[02:46:55.320 --> 02:47:00.600]  come in you know that right that's mainstream news they're above the law I am so sick of
[02:47:00.600 --> 02:47:07.560]  this we America's need to start really getting in the face of the TSA you know and and just
[02:47:07.560 --> 02:47:11.360]  letting them know hey we know and people but more than that the Congress that lets this
[02:47:11.360 --> 02:47:16.960]  go on CJ let's go to Mark and Florida thanks for holding we'll go to Chad and others go
[02:47:16.960 --> 02:47:22.320]  ahead thanks for holding Mark what's your take on the open funding of al-qaeda mass
[02:47:22.320 --> 02:47:27.640]  graves now killing every Christian they get their hands on this is the liberation of Obama
[02:47:27.640 --> 02:47:32.880]  well it's terrible and I feel real bad for those people in the globalist has created
[02:47:32.880 --> 02:47:37.760]  a terrible situation that there's really no way out of there's no good options they screwed
[02:47:37.760 --> 02:47:43.680]  up so bad I mean if we don't do anything I mean you're gonna have Iran you know Hezbollah
[02:47:43.680 --> 02:47:48.400]  Iraq is gonna have to call on Iran Hezbollah all the Shiites to try to take out the Sunnis
[02:47:48.400 --> 02:47:53.120]  if we do get involved they'll just flee to some other countries Syria or Libya which
[02:47:53.120 --> 02:47:58.280]  are now the central governments have no power and who allowed them to regroup who allowed
[02:47:58.280 --> 02:48:05.840]  them to regroup in Libya and in Syria who allowed them to regroup well the Obama administration
[02:48:05.840 --> 02:48:11.320]  they took out Gaddafi they want to take out Bashar al-Assad and it's just ridiculous
[02:48:11.320 --> 02:48:16.600]  is crazy and there's just no way out of the situation I'm real depressed about it I am
[02:48:16.600 --> 02:48:23.160]  too because if our government can get away with this I mean does anybody feel safe having
[02:48:23.160 --> 02:48:29.520]  a government like this well not at all and then you have Democrats attacking the Bush
[02:48:29.520 --> 02:48:33.880]  administration saying see look what Bush did it's all Bush's fault well look I'm not turning
[02:48:33.880 --> 02:48:39.360]  in my guns and I don't support high taxes just because supposedly the Bush administration
[02:48:39.360 --> 02:48:43.360]  you know attacked Iraq that doesn't mean I'm gonna support the Democrat the Democratic
[02:48:43.360 --> 02:48:47.440]  Party for this nonsense oh they're all in together the Democratic Party worked with
[02:48:47.440 --> 02:48:53.520]  Bush we were all against that but I was against the last two wars there now my gut tells me
[02:48:53.520 --> 02:48:59.080]  they could hide a highway of death all those al-Qaeda forces and save Iraq but see they're
[02:48:59.080 --> 02:49:05.120]  not they're gonna let the full civil war go yeah I agree it's crazy they're doing drone
[02:49:05.120 --> 02:49:09.440]  strikes in Yemen drone strikes in Pakistan drone strikes everywhere and I'm not necessarily
[02:49:09.440 --> 02:49:15.600]  for that but then you've got whole convoys of ISIS riding out in the open 30 40 50 cars
[02:49:15.600 --> 02:49:20.840]  in a row and nothing happens and they're just being allowed to take over Iraq oh you're great
[02:49:20.840 --> 02:49:24.520]  you're great caller very informed I've seen somebody as it looks like 500 vehicles it
[02:49:24.520 --> 02:49:33.560]  just goes off into the distance and then Obama's like I gotta go golfing and again that's because
[02:49:33.560 --> 02:49:39.880]  it's Saudi Arabia I'm so sick of Saudi Arabian leadership God bless you appreciate the call
[02:49:39.880 --> 02:49:46.320]  great points Chad in California go ahead you're on the air hi guys yeah we definitely need
[02:49:46.320 --> 02:49:51.960]  to just we were saying that we have nothing to do there we just need to leave and just
[02:49:51.960 --> 02:49:56.560]  admit our mistake we shouldn't have been there like everybody but see but I agree with you
[02:49:56.560 --> 02:50:02.600]  except this is Western backed this is an al-Qaeda army so see I'm always against what the globalist
[02:50:02.600 --> 02:50:06.120]  point they want open borders I'm against it they want gun control I'm against it they
[02:50:06.120 --> 02:50:10.400]  want to let al-Qaeda run rampant but I want to bomb them and I'm not saying do that I'm
[02:50:10.400 --> 02:50:18.000]  just saying you you see my gut response right I see it and then but I'm also going to comment
[02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:22.360]  a little bit that you're not going to like I I'm definitely a constitutionalist and
[02:50:22.360 --> 02:50:28.560]  I've read the Constitution and my first thing is the United States and let me finish the
[02:50:28.560 --> 02:50:34.600]  whole thought the United States has no right to say who can or can't come in yes open borders
[02:50:34.600 --> 02:50:40.480]  I'm saying open borders what the Constitution does allow is the people who come here need
[02:50:40.480 --> 02:50:45.840]  to be taxed higher now figure where's everybody hold on hold on hold on a weekend debate come

[03:08:42.080 --> 03:08:50.160]  i see the way mexican workers work and i mean they work hard folks on average uh but i see poor
[03:08:50.160 --> 03:08:55.440]  blue collar white people black folks that work just as hard it's just that they're in the system if
[03:08:55.440 --> 03:09:00.480]  they're a hispanic american or black american or white american or half the kids out there are mixed
[03:09:00.480 --> 03:09:04.880]  nowadays i don't know what they're gonna do soon when most the kids are hispanic white black white
[03:09:04.880 --> 03:09:13.440]  everything else i mean literally it's all this vulcanization but if you're in the system paying
[03:09:13.440 --> 03:09:20.480]  taxes getting the insurance you can't go get the job that the illegals have got used to painters
[03:09:20.480 --> 03:09:30.960]  got paid enough to live decent you don't know or carpenters my dad put himself a lot through
[03:09:30.960 --> 03:09:34.480]  college you know as a carpenter you can't make that kind of money nowadays my dad had to make
[03:09:34.480 --> 03:09:39.840]  cabinets he can make a lot of money in cabin tree shops and he'd go work a few days a week in those
[03:09:39.840 --> 03:09:44.640]  and a few days a week on the railroad make enough money but those high paying jobs for blue collar
[03:09:44.640 --> 03:09:50.960]  folks are gone and then the expenses are off the chart and there's just more illegals flooding
[03:09:50.960 --> 03:09:56.000]  which will bring us down to third world level which is what the big banks want they want you poor
[03:09:56.000 --> 03:10:01.920]  i wish mexico was like switzerland and i was battling to get in but it's not
[03:10:03.680 --> 03:10:09.680]  i want more free countries more wealthy countries i'll be honest i'm sick of the united states
[03:10:10.480 --> 03:10:14.320]  and i know why these folks are sick of their countries their hellholes they want to come
[03:10:14.320 --> 03:10:17.840]  up here and here's the thing there are a lot of people in mexico or other countries that have it
[03:10:17.840 --> 03:10:22.080]  good in their little community their little town their little tourist trap their little you know
[03:10:22.080 --> 03:10:27.040]  whatever they're the ones that don't want to come here the people that want to come here are the ones
[03:10:27.040 --> 03:10:34.480]  that don't have a pot to pee in let's go back to jack in australia so jack i've talked to people
[03:10:35.520 --> 03:10:41.920]  medical doctors from europe people from eastern europe folks from asia that you know that have
[03:10:41.920 --> 03:10:46.960]  skilled stuff doesn't matter you if you're skilled try to go the regular route it's very hard to get
[03:10:46.960 --> 03:10:54.640]  in or you try to do it legally it's hard to get in but if you just do it illegally then it's okay
[03:10:54.640 --> 03:11:01.440]  and the democratic party particularly is making a ton of money off the immigration lawyers off all
[03:11:01.440 --> 03:11:06.240]  of it in the border states and off all the other rackets and the republican leadership wants the
[03:11:06.240 --> 03:11:11.840]  cheap labor so i don't know how this ends other than the country collapsing uh what do you think
[03:11:11.840 --> 03:11:19.520]  well the thing is that alex from from what i've seen is unless you are latino in in origin
[03:11:21.520 --> 03:11:27.280]  then the law only you know the dream act and everything like that only seems to apply to people
[03:11:27.280 --> 03:11:33.120]  of an hispanic heritage why do you think that's the case why do you think that's the case
[03:11:33.120 --> 03:11:41.600]  asian like myself uh a someone who is self-employed uh christian background i serve 10 years in the
[03:11:41.600 --> 03:11:49.680]  australian military uh you know a godfaring small business owner it seems like uh under this
[03:11:49.680 --> 03:11:56.000]  administration you're undesirable in the united states i can't do the sort of talk radio that
[03:11:56.000 --> 03:12:02.320]  i do and and like you do in australia because there are laws on the books that that get in the way
[03:12:02.320 --> 03:12:06.880]  of free speech for broadcasters in australia no no i know you have a fairness doctrine there i'm
[03:12:06.880 --> 03:12:11.360]  aware of that but internet radio is circumventing that and australians i know we're starting to
[03:12:11.360 --> 03:12:18.240]  wake up i talked to a lot of them but look what's happening is multifaceted liberation communist
[03:12:18.240 --> 03:12:24.000]  ideology was put into mexico and the rest of central and south america in the last 60 years
[03:12:24.000 --> 03:12:30.960]  it's on record so that all opposition to the right wing hunters is only communist in nature
[03:12:30.960 --> 03:12:39.600]  so the globalists know how to manage socialist immigrants they have deals with western countries
[03:12:39.600 --> 03:12:44.720]  that don't want to see their tax base flee like they've done like shon khanry you know flooding
[03:12:44.720 --> 03:12:48.880]  one for decades when he's making a bunch of money because they had a 70 tax rate federal it's been
[03:12:48.880 --> 03:12:55.680]  lowered since he came back they have deals to make it hard for americans to get out too bro
[03:12:55.680 --> 03:13:01.600]  so if you're black white i don't care you got money they've been passing laws and regulations
[03:13:01.600 --> 03:13:07.760]  to make it hard for you to get out as well so it's beyond really that you're white it's about the
[03:13:07.760 --> 03:13:14.800]  fact you're a tax base and they don't want skilled people being able to get out they only want poor
[03:13:14.800 --> 03:13:20.240]  to be able to come in and so that's what's happening but if i was you i'd do a youtube show on it
[03:13:20.240 --> 03:13:24.960]  and i would just you know hammer on that i would call it you know i'm a prisoner or a prisoner of
[03:13:24.960 --> 03:13:32.240]  australia and and just explain because again you want working people to be able to move easy
[03:13:32.960 --> 03:13:37.520]  because then it creates competition between the countries for skilled labor like switzerland
[03:13:38.560 --> 03:13:42.400]  and they're an extreme i mean i mean you know it's the hardest country to get into probably in the
[03:13:42.400 --> 03:13:47.920]  world and and it's so you know off the charts that who knows if you want to live there it's so
[03:13:47.920 --> 03:13:53.600]  expensive but that's the model of only letting people that have something to offer in then it
[03:13:53.600 --> 03:13:58.880]  becomes literally like heaven uh i mean switzerland's just ultra gorgeous ultra beautiful ultra low
[03:13:58.880 --> 03:14:06.240]  crime everybody's got guns versus what we've become and it's just an example of what dependency
[03:14:06.240 --> 03:14:10.560]  does i appreciate your call uh skip and florida skip thanks for holding you're on the air
[03:14:10.560 --> 03:14:17.920]  there hello alex hey buddy i've been waiting to talk to you for a while well good to have you on
[03:14:17.920 --> 03:14:25.600]  brother the wait is over well i uh think we ought to fuel up air force one and load uh all the
[03:14:25.600 --> 03:14:30.480]  abomb administration sending right over there with their swords and guns and uh tell them to start
[03:14:30.480 --> 03:14:37.040]  uh working on the second amendment over there well you know i want to say this about elites
[03:14:37.040 --> 03:14:41.760]  no one in history would follow elites that didn't fight there were all sorts of dictators all sorts
[03:14:41.760 --> 03:14:51.200]  of kings all sorts of corrupt groups but until about 150 200 years ago if you didn't put the king
[03:14:51.200 --> 03:14:56.080]  or at least his sons on the front line and kings almost always lost their sons whether they're
[03:14:56.080 --> 03:15:01.760]  having like six or seven of them if you didn't have family members dying a war you were overthrown
[03:15:01.760 --> 03:15:09.040]  only now in the modern age do elites march people off to war and their kids aren't in the game
[03:15:09.040 --> 03:15:14.240]  show absolutely i love all these warmongers most the neocons never were in the military and they
[03:15:14.240 --> 03:15:21.040]  want to have all these wars what do you think of that i think uh it was your idea they should start
[03:15:21.040 --> 03:15:27.920]  them no i agree i mean there's nothing worse than some some smart mouth who's ever been in a fight
[03:15:27.920 --> 03:15:32.160]  starting fights we'll tell you something you've been in some real fights you don't want to start
[03:15:32.160 --> 03:15:38.800]  anymore you know because i mean you know fighting as an adult male is dangerous it hurts bad
[03:15:40.720 --> 03:15:45.360]  and and you know there's so many people want to be tough guys write checks their mouths can't
[03:15:46.560 --> 03:15:54.000]  cash their mouths write checks their bodies can't cash and uh it's a scary situation that's why
[03:15:54.000 --> 03:15:58.480]  that's why some people now shoot each other even though overall shootings are down they're still
[03:15:58.480 --> 03:16:04.000]  the case where somebody starts a fist fight starts losing they pull a gun and it's because
[03:16:04.000 --> 03:16:08.720]  they thought something else was going to happen in this fight they got into great points i appreciate
[03:16:08.720 --> 03:16:14.400]  your call skip let's talk to albert in femo region 10 i guess you're out on the former west coast go
[03:16:14.400 --> 03:16:20.000]  ahead hey alex how you doing today doing all right brother i just want to give you a little
[03:16:20.000 --> 03:16:26.000]  prediction here that i see about this immigration thing you're going to have these vast populations
[03:16:26.000 --> 03:16:30.480]  talking about all the places in all the major cities and whatnot and you're going to see gang
[03:16:30.480 --> 03:16:37.440]  lives and drugs escalate to an exponential proportion you know you gotta realize remember
[03:16:37.440 --> 03:16:42.400]  a couple weeks ago you had that deal about the border patrol and the threats on the billboards
[03:16:42.400 --> 03:16:47.680]  and things like that from the cartels down in mexico well i believe that molly's immigrants
[03:16:47.680 --> 03:16:52.480]  are actually going to be a mule for them and distributed for them and obama's allowing them
[03:16:52.480 --> 03:16:57.280]  in and telling them that that's actually already in the intelligence reports being put up by
[03:16:57.280 --> 03:17:02.160]  different federal agencies we saw those last week that this fog of hundreds of thousands of people
[03:17:02.160 --> 03:17:07.760]  born across extra is a perfect fog for the mules and people say oh well so what it's drugs you
[03:17:07.760 --> 03:17:12.640]  know decriminalized yeah to shut off the criminals making the money but while it's still illegal
[03:17:13.360 --> 03:17:17.600]  you got to stop them down there because they're the suppliers and they're involved in kidnapped
[03:17:17.600 --> 03:17:24.800]  mapping every i mean absolutely absolutely i mean my god i am scared to go to mexico now folks and
[03:17:24.800 --> 03:17:30.560]  i it's a beautiful country there's a state department warning on it mexico has collapsed
[03:17:31.520 --> 03:17:36.480]  and it's called who was the state senator we had on two years ago with the pentagon prediction
[03:17:36.480 --> 03:17:40.960]  that mexico would collapse within two years i had the state senator on that exposed it
[03:17:40.960 --> 03:17:45.200]  turned out there's a secret plan with the texas guard to try to stop it if the feds won't
[03:17:45.200 --> 03:17:49.520]  but i we can see the whole border collapse look this is just the beginning if obama
[03:17:50.080 --> 03:17:52.800]  legalizes these illegals that are pouring across what's going to happen
[03:17:53.360 --> 03:17:59.280]  going to bring even bigger floods that too but also you're going to see the escalation and gain
[03:17:59.280 --> 03:18:05.280]  violence alec it's just going to be off the hook with gain violence that's going to justify the
[03:18:05.280 --> 03:18:10.880]  penetration of the police force which will be the false flag no i hear you no that's it that's
[03:18:10.880 --> 03:18:15.760]  why the globalists get more power the worst things get the more power they get used to if
[03:18:15.760 --> 03:18:20.880]  something happened bad on your watch you had to resign or you went to jail in america when fema
[03:18:20.880 --> 03:18:26.320]  didn't help in katrina they got doubled the funding when we get attacked by saudi arabia we attack

[03:18:41.680 --> 03:18:45.520]  i don't care if they open the borders let everybody in but you don't get benefits
[03:18:45.520 --> 03:18:50.880]  okay i mean no no no that's it exactly the immigration's a good thing if the people don't
[03:18:50.880 --> 03:18:55.760]  get benefits right it controls the motivation factor you come in here for opportunity and freedom
[03:18:55.760 --> 03:19:00.400]  where you come in here for benefits that tells you right away another thing is these illegal
[03:19:00.400 --> 03:19:06.000]  aliens would be a great way to introduce a bio weapon thanks alec really good points we got time
