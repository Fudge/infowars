[00:00.000 --> 00:12.520]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.520 --> 00:20.960]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex
[00:20.960 --> 00:32.640]  jones fund manager economist Peter Schiff's going to be joining us coming up the second hour today
[00:32.640 --> 00:41.680]  tukari jackson will briefly pop in thank god there weren't any real insinuary events since
[00:41.680 --> 00:46.920]  the tragic event last wednesday in charleston south carolina so we'll be bringing our reporters back
[00:46.920 --> 00:52.160]  we'll get a final report the start of the third hour today from charleston south carolina with
[00:52.160 --> 01:02.160]  jacari jackson it is the 22nd day of june 2015 on this monday edition yesterday i spent some of
[01:02.160 --> 01:10.480]  the show some of the broadcasts the sunday transmission getting into a video report that
[01:10.480 --> 01:16.880]  i posted saturday total emergency alert elite now evacuating signs of coming financial melt
[01:16.880 --> 01:25.400]  down or accelerating an alarming rate and there's even more news today backing all of that up i
[01:25.400 --> 01:33.400]  want to be clear here i am not predicting a financial collapse by the end of this year i
[01:33.400 --> 01:42.800]  hope that doesn't happen but most establishment experts and alternative experts are saying
[01:42.800 --> 01:51.920]  that it's all going that direction anybody that pays attention to the financial pages knows
[01:51.920 --> 01:59.800]  that it's like we've had 50 bypass surgeries and half our hearts dead i don't know when our
[01:59.800 --> 02:07.480]  hearts gonna blow but it's rotten it's built on a giant house of cards and the winds starting
[02:07.480 --> 02:13.200]  to blow and i'm watching them teeter like somebody with 100 plates on their hand juggling
[02:13.200 --> 02:20.120]  them or a fellow juggling six or seven baseballs i don't care how good they are they can't
[02:20.120 --> 02:26.200]  go forever and then the elite are running into bunkers they're moving us commandos and weapons
[02:26.200 --> 02:36.400]  in that's an ap secretary of defense is announced to engage the russians that's today the world
[02:36.400 --> 02:45.800]  is going crazy and it's not me saying this though i said it first five six years ago
[02:45.800 --> 02:55.320]  it's all over the news that elites are fleeing major western capitals from televive to new
[02:55.320 --> 03:04.240]  york from los angeles to london they're running to the middle of nowhere and that's in the
[03:04.240 --> 03:09.920]  london guardian and in the associated press i hope nothing happens i hope everything's
[03:09.920 --> 03:16.920]  okay but this many historians in fact you print me this guys i forgot to do it are pointing
[03:16.920 --> 03:23.400]  out there are a lot of parallels right now to what happened before world war one and
[03:23.400 --> 03:32.880]  world war two but particularly world war one and also print me guys the british ministry
[03:32.880 --> 03:37.840]  of defense report flash mobs brain chips pulls it up it's a london guardian article
[03:37.840 --> 03:43.440]  but there's an actual report from six years ago predicting that going into twenty sixteen
[03:43.440 --> 03:51.320]  and beyond we would see global destabilization and cascading meltdowns you can pull up mainstream
[03:51.320 --> 03:56.400]  articles pentagon preparing for collapse there it is revolution flash mobs and brain chips
[03:56.400 --> 04:08.640]  a grim vision of the future you'd have to be blind to not know that we're in a serious
[04:08.640 --> 04:14.520]  situation now the usual suspects are going to criticize me for warning people and then
[04:14.520 --> 04:19.600]  if this stuff doesn't take place by the fall the winter next year it'll be oh look you
[04:19.600 --> 04:27.960]  predicted a collapse again we're seeing a global collapse all over the world except
[04:27.960 --> 04:36.760]  in some areas of the west i mean if you're in greece if you're in spain if you're in
[04:36.760 --> 04:42.040]  portugal if you're in most areas of africa if you're in most areas of the middle east
[04:42.040 --> 04:48.560]  most areas of some areas of asia latin america venezuela you're in a full board depression
[04:48.560 --> 04:55.920]  civil war craziness and then you've got these domesticated westerners who have no idea how
[04:55.920 --> 05:04.160]  much danger we're in while the nation's mainstream media continues to obsess over the tragic and
[05:04.160 --> 05:10.400]  cowardly charleston shooting two other mass shootings occurred this past weekend in detroit
[05:10.400 --> 05:15.560]  and philadelphia but were barely covered at all despite the fact that nineteen people
[05:15.560 --> 05:21.280]  were shot and one person was killed in detroit saturday night one person was killed and nine
[05:21.280 --> 05:27.080]  were wounded after a block party turned into a mass shooting detroit police chief james
[05:27.080 --> 05:33.680]  craig labeled the culprits as urban terrorist a similar situation unfolded in philadelphia
[05:33.680 --> 05:40.800]  when a block party descended into chaos ten people were hospitalized including three children
[05:40.800 --> 05:45.480]  you'll not hear about this however from the corporate media which continues to project
[05:45.480 --> 05:51.320]  the narrative that black people are being unfairly targeted by predominantly white police officers

[07:59.200 --> 08:13.920]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones
[08:13.920 --> 08:29.200]  I am going to attempt to summon my intellect my focus to try to be as direct and cut and
[08:29.200 --> 08:38.280]  dry as I can the information I'm about to break down is of the greatest import on the
[08:38.280 --> 08:48.600]  face of this planet today undoubtedly every major western defense department is putting
[08:48.600 --> 08:56.000]  out public policy reports stating they believe that western society will start collapsing
[08:56.000 --> 09:04.720]  in 2016 peaking in 2025 the british ministry of defense first came out with this report
[09:04.720 --> 09:12.000]  in 2007 the london guardian reported on it revolution flash mobs and brain chips a grim
[09:12.000 --> 09:20.720]  vision of the future you read the news headlines today and then physically see what's happening
[09:20.720 --> 09:28.320]  on the streets it's unfolding all over the world except in a few wealthy western pockets
[09:28.320 --> 09:38.960]  and even there the signs of the collapse are speeding up dramatically western governments
[09:38.960 --> 09:50.960]  are training and stockpiling for civil war derivatives since 2008 have only expanded
[09:50.960 --> 10:03.360]  from 1.6 quadrillion globally 1,600 trillion to 2.2 quadrillion debt not owned not owed
[10:03.360 --> 10:18.800]  by the people this has all been artificially orchestrated and and brought into place
[10:18.800 --> 10:28.480]  to execute the global cascading crises and fiasco's so the managing class the ruling
[10:28.480 --> 10:36.960]  class can bring in their technocracy planetary government as the solution we are seeing world
[10:36.960 --> 10:44.840]  leaders from the pope right down to the media at the weather channel endorsing global government
[10:44.840 --> 11:01.640]  and carbon taxes we are seeing rule by secrecy being flaunted openly with the tpp we are
[11:01.640 --> 11:17.640]  witnessing the final preparations for a new kind of war to be launched a war by the technotronic
[11:17.640 --> 11:27.680]  technocrat technotourney class against civilization and against humanity because they believe
[11:27.680 --> 11:34.800]  that they're not in full control of civilization and that civilization is wasteful and destructive
[11:34.800 --> 11:42.920]  and humanity is a cancer and must be removed in an emergency surgery now which of course
[11:42.920 --> 11:50.840]  transfers all the power and the control and the spoils of the technological revolution
[11:50.840 --> 12:05.520]  to a tiny elite hitler talked about the breast of the earth being crushed by the weight of
[12:05.520 --> 12:12.160]  humanity he was quoting of course the philosopher play dough who believe grease was overpopulated
[12:12.160 --> 12:27.600]  2400 plus years ago hitler did everything he did basically along the lines of pita he
[12:27.600 --> 12:35.000]  was a vegetarian he was an animal rights activist and the reason I raise all this is that this
[12:35.000 --> 12:40.760]  whole cultural shift you can decide to join with it and see it from the perspective of
[12:40.760 --> 12:45.200]  humans are hurting the earth and humans are hurting animals and humans are destructive
[12:45.200 --> 12:51.840]  and humans are a cancer and then join with it but you only join in helping organize the
[12:51.840 --> 12:57.320]  downfall of our species as we know it and the transference of power to the elite and
[12:57.320 --> 13:06.040]  you will not be allowed entrance into the globalist overall master program we are living
[13:06.040 --> 13:17.240]  in a super hardcore dystopic reality where the old vestiges of the decadent dumb down
[13:17.240 --> 13:28.480]  bloated corrupt mafia system is about to be swept away and in its place something beyond
[13:28.480 --> 13:35.040]  any science fiction nightmare novel you've ever read the globalist have written it in
[13:35.040 --> 13:40.760]  hundreds of books they've put it in thousands of white papers I've made 20 plus films most
[13:40.760 --> 13:49.920]  of them on the eugenics subject I am one of the world experts on this from the outside
[13:49.920 --> 13:59.360]  on the inside they know a lot more than I do just what's publicly available is so horrific
[13:59.360 --> 14:08.600]  it makes my heart stop a beat I don't know if there's going to be a collapse this year
[14:08.600 --> 14:12.960]  I don't know if it's going to be next year but I know the derivatives are untenable I
[14:12.960 --> 14:21.260]  know the military actions are building up towards a crisis I know the elites are making
[14:21.260 --> 14:30.120]  final preparations and running out of the west to remote armored redoubts fortresses
[14:30.120 --> 14:39.640]  keeps castles bunkers and it's in the news and then I get calls by people in government
[14:39.640 --> 14:45.880]  and people in the military and people in entertainment I don't just make those claims you've heard
[14:45.880 --> 14:49.400]  all the famous people that have been on this show that we've woken up or who were already
[14:49.400 --> 14:53.160]  awake and reached out to us for every one you hear on the show there's 10 or 15 that
[14:53.160 --> 14:57.120]  are scared to come on a lot of which are bigger than who you've heard on this broadcast and
[14:57.120 --> 15:05.120]  they're all confirming what we are witnessing there is a death battle commitment being set
[15:05.120 --> 15:10.560]  up right now by the western elites to take over the world to save it from humanity they've
[15:10.560 --> 15:16.480]  got to have a planetary government in place to have global one child policies forced inoculations
[15:16.480 --> 15:26.400]  forced GMO to sterilize us on record forced bans on eating meat break up of the family
[15:26.400 --> 15:34.240]  cultural revolution with a futuristic overlay with a great leap forward communalizing all
[15:34.240 --> 15:41.680]  of us not to build humanity towards the future that would fail of course but consciously to
[15:41.680 --> 15:49.000]  collectivize us into a corporate Borg hive to have an orderly dismantlement and extermination
[15:49.000 --> 15:56.400]  of humanity starting with the third world using the collapsing third world to collapse
[15:56.400 --> 16:05.840]  the west except for government corporate military reservations that will take full control of
[16:05.840 --> 16:11.200]  what's left of the west in the name of protecting the west during the collapse and we'll use
[16:11.200 --> 16:16.360]  that to consolidate fully all the rest of the resources into themselves because they'll
[16:16.360 --> 16:21.880]  be exempt from taxes exempt from carbon trading exempt from all of the other rules fusing it
[16:21.880 --> 16:30.840]  all under national and global security into their command based citadels that are not
[16:30.840 --> 16:38.000]  yet complete to carry out the final bio weapon releases that will wipe out 99% of the world
[16:38.000 --> 16:41.840]  they tell their first initiates we're going to kill 80% you're going to be part of it
[16:41.840 --> 16:49.600]  higher level 90 deeper than issue it's 98 and when you get up to the very highest levels
[16:49.600 --> 17:00.160]  of the UN world government IBM global panopticonic supercomputer master plan it's more than 1%
[17:00.160 --> 17:07.920]  that'll be wiped out it goes it's more than 99 I haven't gotten into any documents
[17:07.920 --> 17:15.640]  or sources where they're talking about killing more than 99 but it's you can look at it and
[17:15.640 --> 17:20.760]  tell their planning they're not going to leave 34 million people they're going for broke
[17:20.760 --> 17:28.520]  these globalists will start killing each other they're not going to with their wickedness
[17:28.520 --> 17:34.720]  and their craven hatred of others and their fearfulness and their greed that spirits never
[17:34.720 --> 17:41.320]  going to end until there are two new world order super beings in their view merge with
[17:41.320 --> 17:47.760]  computers that will basically engage in a war with each other that curse well and others
[17:47.760 --> 17:53.920]  claim no we won't do that to each other we'll all just blast off in our spaceships as computers
[17:53.920 --> 17:59.440]  and go colonize and build new creations as God it's totally delusional it's totally insane
[17:59.440 --> 18:04.160]  I'm not saying it's going to work I'm not saying it's real but think about the Egyptians
[18:04.160 --> 18:10.000]  they just found 8 million mummified dogs in Egypt because they thought that made the dog
[18:10.000 --> 18:16.240]  live with them into the future whole societies based around whacked out bull Hitler you know
[18:16.240 --> 18:22.800]  all that stuff Jim Jones communism all this craziness this is organized around science
[18:22.800 --> 18:28.960]  this is organized around technology and the eugenicist starting in the 1850s with Sir
[18:28.960 --> 18:37.840]  Francis Galton and with Darwin Charles Darwin they were cousins they created the whole system
[18:37.840 --> 18:42.880]  we live under today and a lot of elitists say to me they say Alex we're going to come
[18:42.880 --> 18:50.720]  back and talk to Paul Watson they say Alex the elite invented all this to take over
[18:50.720 --> 18:56.000]  doesn't that mean they have the right to rule because they care to have power they care
[18:56.000 --> 19:01.720]  to build civilization they care to pick members of the public they believe are worth their
[19:01.720 --> 19:07.720]  weight to join them why don't you join them Alex the mere fact that you are aware of all
[19:07.720 --> 19:16.720]  this and care means you should join in fact I've even basically had the messages sent
[19:16.720 --> 19:24.280]  to me that I could join them now and I sit here and watch the public wanting to be destroyed
[19:24.280 --> 19:30.320]  wanting to be annihilated wanting to have your soul sucked wanting to turn yourself over
[19:30.320 --> 19:36.760]  to this false reality and this false culture of mind controlled narcissists when we come
[19:36.760 --> 19:40.520]  back I'm getting into the evidence of the orchestrated worldwide collapse that we are

[24:14.560 --> 24:21.280]  waging war on corruption so here's the bottom line the dominant ideology of the planetary
[24:21.280 --> 24:33.360]  ruling elite is a worship of science to build systems of advanced life extension and control
[24:33.360 --> 24:43.080]  of matter and the general public just running around watching football and acting tough and
[24:43.080 --> 24:50.840]  women putting makeup on all day is seen as suboid and under social Darwinism deserves
[24:50.840 --> 24:57.040]  to be annihilated and killed and so they put out a whole pseudo fake culture to break down
[24:57.040 --> 25:03.280]  the original human society to make us weak so we can be overwritten by the new system
[25:03.280 --> 25:11.760]  where we do not exist except in very small numbers and this is all admitted by the compendium
[25:11.760 --> 25:18.680]  of thought of the ruling intellectuals the problem is the general public doesn't watch
[25:18.680 --> 25:23.120]  that they're busy race fighting and obsessing over sexual preference and you know running
[25:23.120 --> 25:29.520]  around listening to pseudo science about carbon they want to tax carbon to take full control
[25:29.520 --> 25:37.320]  of society they want to create a new dark age new feudalism and then just look at these
[25:37.320 --> 25:40.480]  headlines I'm going to cover when we come back in the next segment but the reason I
[25:40.480 --> 25:46.920]  wanted to get Paul Watson on was to discuss with him writing a master article with him
[25:46.920 --> 25:52.760]  this evening and tomorrow morning for info wars dot com and prison planet dot com that
[25:52.760 --> 25:58.560]  basically has a headline breaking down the fact that proof that global elite are orchestrating
[25:58.560 --> 26:05.040]  a worldwide collapse that they use to consolidate power use their quotes use their examples
[26:05.040 --> 26:10.680]  use the fact that they created the derivatives they overthrew the middle east they put the
[26:10.680 --> 26:17.840]  radicals in charge just showing down the line and we'll also put on screen that the article
[26:17.840 --> 26:25.040]  about internment camps for us citizens the fact that all this goes together with the
[26:25.040 --> 26:31.240]  government reports with the ministry of defense beyond denial preparations for martial law
[26:31.240 --> 26:36.120]  in america another very important video and the other article Paul wrote two years ago
[26:36.120 --> 26:41.080]  off the army's own public purchase plans Paul did that headline up I really want to show
[26:41.080 --> 26:48.080]  that there it is leaked us army documents planned for reeducation camps in america they even
[26:48.080 --> 26:56.240]  use the term reeducation camp it's a soviet term that's not our headline you add all
[26:56.240 --> 27:01.440]  this together the elite have made the decision that the earth's carrying capacity has been
[27:01.440 --> 27:07.960]  passed they decided to get us all ready with a cultural narrative that the fall of humanity
[27:07.960 --> 27:12.840]  is here and then if you try to get prepared for it or try to stop it they come to you
[27:12.840 --> 27:20.280]  and say nothing's happening everything's fine move along while they're running debunkers
[27:20.280 --> 27:24.720]  and a lot of its mid-level elite even billionaires are mid-level to the top elite they've just
[27:24.720 --> 27:28.920]  gotten the word it's all true so they may be running early because they found out this
[27:28.920 --> 27:34.640]  is really the plan it might be two years from now I don't know I want to stop it they always
[27:34.640 --> 27:39.600]  spent it to say he's just fear mongering he's just saying world war one could start he's
[27:39.600 --> 27:46.160]  just saying world war two could start he's just saying we're seeing it so how do we get
[27:46.160 --> 27:50.520]  the public to admit it well we document it and then how do we get the public to wake
[27:50.520 --> 27:57.000]  up to it and at least have a cultural discussion about do we want the elite to poison us and
[27:57.000 --> 28:01.400]  kill us maybe we should just have public programs where they're very honest about it you go
[28:01.400 --> 28:05.720]  to the euthanasia center and you get killed your family get some bonus creds and you get
[28:05.720 --> 28:10.240]  sterilized you get bonus money that's where they're moving when when robots do all the
[28:10.240 --> 28:15.640]  work and nobody can get a job the elite right in their books that you're going to get sterilized
[28:15.640 --> 28:20.040]  for your ten-year welfare program and then after ten years somebody in your family's
[28:20.040 --> 28:24.400]  got to be euthanized and so the rest of the family gets to live this is how they actuary
[28:24.400 --> 28:31.920]  at all out like logan's run they've been preconditioning us the whole time what do you think human
[28:31.920 --> 28:40.960]  sacrifice was it was about overpopulation in old societies what they saw is overpopulation
[28:40.960 --> 28:44.200]  paul watch them we're going to break but i want to come back and talk to you about
[28:44.200 --> 28:47.760]  what we should put in this article and how we wake people up but do you concur with
[28:47.760 --> 28:52.640]  my analysis and with the flurry of activity we're seeing and where do you think it's going
[28:52.640 --> 28:58.760]  to be oh undoubtedly alex there are three flashpoints one of which is the potential
[28:58.760 --> 29:03.920]  for world war three which again sober experts are talking about not just us another is the
[29:03.920 --> 29:09.040]  the bond market implosion the economic collapse the move towards banning cash all together
[29:09.040 --> 29:14.080]  and then the third pillar is the domestic unrest which of course has been managed from the
[29:14.080 --> 29:18.960]  very beginning by people like george soros so when you get those three factors coalescing
[29:18.960 --> 29:23.720]  together it could create the flashpoint for a major collapse and you know i don't say
[29:23.720 --> 29:28.920]  that often but i fully agree with you that this is probably the most dangerous time since
[29:28.920 --> 29:33.440]  i've been alive i would say that definitely since the the cold war so we're in a very
[29:33.440 --> 29:38.520]  dangerous time right now and ron paul says in his life the most dangerous ron paul says
[29:38.520 --> 29:45.880]  get ready it's all about to come down i mean it's incredible it's gone this far stay there

[30:08.200 --> 30:14.160]  to a white supremacy group a new report reveals that rand paul's political action committee
[30:14.160 --> 30:20.480]  accepted a donation from the council of conservative citizens a group that was also mentioned in

[30:31.480 --> 30:36.560]  from the group to the mother immanuel hope fund but regardless paul's opponents will
[30:36.560 --> 30:42.200]  use this story in an attempt to sabotage his presidential bid paul has also joined the
[30:42.200 --> 30:47.280]  fight to release the secret twenty eight pages missing from the official nine eleven report

[41:10.240 --> 41:15.280]  from the world bank how it's orchestrated how they're now doing it here how they're
[41:15.280 --> 41:20.000]  destabilizing the middle east how they're destabilizing ukraine how they're selling
[41:20.000 --> 41:25.680]  humans is bad how they're lowering our immune systems with the vaccines how they're introducing
[41:25.680 --> 41:30.360]  this whole eugenics program and how they're now moving us towards a global collapse out
[41:30.360 --> 41:35.440]  of which they bring in their world government and then they can really orchestrate crises
[41:35.440 --> 41:40.080]  once they've got russia and china merged with them following orders they'll be nowhere to
[41:40.080 --> 41:45.840]  run nobody to be in opposition when they're releasing bio weapons that are wiping out
[41:45.840 --> 41:52.280]  ninety nine percent of people that come in contact with it they'll have the cure you
[41:52.280 --> 41:56.960]  go in that moon raker yeah in my six top guy wrote it it's about the elite releasing
[41:56.960 --> 42:01.240]  bio weapons to kill a hundred percent of the population they then come back down from their
[42:01.240 --> 42:06.000]  space station it won't be done like that it's going to be from bunkers and they have the
[42:06.000 --> 42:10.080]  cure and i'm just telling you we're trying to stop them if there's awareness to this
[42:10.080 --> 42:14.720]  and we can get people to tune out a break in bad i get it's a good show or house of cards
[42:14.720 --> 42:20.440]  or the nfl draft for five minutes but a lot of adults go alex i know you're right i talked
[42:20.440 --> 42:23.920]  to executives and people they go i'm just gonna go play golf and have a good time there's
[42:23.920 --> 42:31.360]  nothing we can do i've i've had i've hung out with top microbiologists i've hung out
[42:31.360 --> 42:37.680]  with just you i mean you name it they all know it's true and then i sit here with the
[42:37.680 --> 42:42.560]  public and the public just won't wrap their mind around it all right paul watson i've
[42:42.560 --> 42:47.440]  put out my brain storm as best i can you've got the floor for the next five ten minutes
[42:47.440 --> 42:53.520]  crystallize where you think we are add other points to this and then how do we warn the
[42:53.520 --> 42:58.080]  public how do we warn the elite i see one Achilles heel that's why they want to go to
[42:58.080 --> 43:03.960]  total automation drones robots autonomous systems so that the human factor can't stop them
[43:03.960 --> 43:09.560]  because they've told their minions that they're just going to control population and get rid
[43:09.560 --> 43:14.320]  of the dumb people and they're using dumb down culture just to stun us right now so
[43:14.320 --> 43:18.360]  they can do the operation and then they're going to take us out of deep freeze and try
[43:18.360 --> 43:22.960]  to you know have a new renaissance that's what they tell high level people that aren't
[43:22.960 --> 43:29.440]  in the upper chamber i think if we can reach out to them we might be able to stop this
[43:29.440 --> 43:35.080]  the problem is we reach out to them they go research it decompartmentalize they bug out
[43:35.080 --> 43:44.480]  and run to new zealand or you know run to another area and kind of just try to run with the
[43:44.480 --> 43:49.120]  big boys already built secret landing strips and command bases that again the guardian
[43:49.120 --> 43:54.560]  others have reported on which the elite ought to know you collapse this you're not going
[43:54.560 --> 43:59.040]  to get everybody people are going to come after you i mean you've got to know you're
[43:59.040 --> 44:05.480]  not going to pull this moon raker business off i mean i just i just wonder if viewers
[44:05.480 --> 44:13.000]  and listeners understand this isn't a joke people i can't go play golf i can't go skeet
[44:13.000 --> 44:16.760]  shooting i can't do any of the things i like to do because i just can't quit thinking about
[44:16.760 --> 44:21.480]  this but then i just get burned out and exhausted and then i just want to run as well and just
[44:21.480 --> 44:28.240]  let you all kill yourselves and and wear dresses while you're being bio weapon paul watson i've
[44:28.240 --> 44:34.320]  been ranting you you go ahead you know i'm in a video about this few weeks ago called
[44:34.320 --> 44:40.280]  why more riots are coming soon which breaks a lot of it down and basically they've created
[44:40.280 --> 44:46.760]  the preconditions for this because they've they know down to a fine detail that wealth
[44:46.760 --> 44:53.520]  inequality causes mass mass social unrest in alliance with a drop in real wages so they've
[44:53.520 --> 45:01.640]  built this whole consumer society around obtaining products and items you know family social mobility
[45:01.640 --> 45:06.560]  religion that's all declining in influence so we have these lifestyles built around the
[45:06.560 --> 45:12.120]  acquisition of products which is going to become harder and harder to maintain and when you
[45:12.120 --> 45:18.760]  actually study the causes of the london riots for example it was this feeling of increased
[45:18.760 --> 45:24.880]  corruption and distrust in the established authorities which we now got in america to
[45:24.880 --> 45:31.520]  the greatest degree we've seen ever probably social alienation and a lack of community
[45:31.520 --> 45:36.840]  which of course causes this this criminal behavior which we saw during the london riots so as
[45:36.840 --> 45:41.880]  these as this lifestyle built around the acquisition of products becomes harder to maintain you're
[45:41.880 --> 45:46.680]  going to see more unrest more riots and they know that's going to happen because they've
[45:46.680 --> 45:52.000]  created the preconditions for it we're now at the worst level since before world war
[45:52.000 --> 45:58.760]  two in terms of wealth inequality precisely because of their canesian central bank policies
[45:58.760 --> 46:05.120]  this endless money printing worldwide inflation real inflation in comparison to real wages
[46:05.120 --> 46:10.360]  which are dropping so they know that that's all going to coalesce and come together and
[46:10.360 --> 46:14.400]  we're already seeing it and we've seen it in Ferguson we've seen it in baltimore they
[46:14.400 --> 46:21.920]  have also known and had control of social media uprising since at least 2010 we talked
[46:21.920 --> 46:27.120]  about that before bill de burg 2013 because they actually had the big you know google
[46:27.120 --> 46:33.280]  meeting in that same hotel the year before whereby they can go in and judge when these
[46:33.280 --> 46:37.960]  uprisings are going to take place whether they're steered or organic and immediately
[46:37.960 --> 46:45.400]  hijacked them so if you get a tunisian fruit seller moment moment in any area of the world
[46:45.400 --> 46:50.320]  they know when that's going to snap when the mass the flash mobs are going to descend
[46:50.320 --> 46:55.240]  and they can steer and control that narrative and huge groups of people and they've had
[46:55.240 --> 47:01.680]  that capacity since at least 2010 not just with twitter but with other social media
[47:01.680 --> 47:08.280]  so that of course that all arose out of brazinski's i think it was also 2010 this global political
[47:08.280 --> 47:14.600]  awakening which he said basically represented a direct threat to their monopoly of power
[47:14.600 --> 47:18.120]  they said it's just easier to kill people now we're not going to wake them up we basically
[47:18.120 --> 47:25.720]  have to kill them that was his barely veiled threat and just to interrupt take the head
[47:25.720 --> 47:30.040]  of the soros group not telling anybody he's soros group and nobody in the news pointing
[47:30.040 --> 47:34.120]  it out coming out at davos and saying we have to have a global government to redistribute
[47:34.120 --> 47:39.040]  wealth because there's too many rich people when they're the ultra rich waging war against
[47:39.040 --> 47:43.720]  the new rich who actually hire people and run jobs and then they create the crisis and
[47:43.720 --> 47:48.480]  offer the solution giving them more power when they exempt themselves publicly from
[47:48.480 --> 47:53.840]  the taxes it's totally sick and then he says soros is worried about riots when he's the
[47:53.840 --> 47:59.040]  one financing him i mean it's just incredible how transparent they are when you know what
[47:59.040 --> 48:07.480]  enemies they are and don't forget soros himself came out in 2012 over two and a half years
[48:07.480 --> 48:15.080]  before ferguson and said that these mass riots this uprising was coming then he starts financing
[48:15.080 --> 48:20.320]  black lives matter to the tune of however many hundreds of millions of dollars the good
[48:20.320 --> 48:26.680]  news is yesterday this black lives matter crowd tried to descend on charleston saturday and
[48:26.680 --> 48:32.760]  sunday to stir up violence and unrest in response to this lone gunman shooting which was blamed
[48:32.760 --> 48:38.320]  on all white people by salon and the left wing media and hillary charleston there were
[48:38.320 --> 48:42.640]  a few war memorials that were vandalized but they basically told them to get the hell out
[48:42.640 --> 48:49.520]  of town there was in fact it was even trending on twitter yesterday go home d-ray d-ray is
[48:49.520 --> 48:55.120]  one of the leaders of this black lives matter movement and and and the black folks the christians
[48:55.120 --> 49:00.120]  and charleston they were tweeting all lives matter yeah and they were doing peaceful prayer
[49:00.120 --> 49:04.480]  vigils and saying look we're not going to let you burn down our town and our businesses
[49:04.480 --> 49:10.320]  like you did in ferguson and baltimore get back on your buses and go home so that completely
[49:10.320 --> 49:14.000]  blew up in their face so that's the positive i think we are starting to get through to
[49:14.000 --> 49:20.360]  people that this whole class warfare narrative is being steered it's not an organic uprising
[49:20.360 --> 49:24.200]  it's being controlled from above it's the ultra rich that want to scapegoat the new
[49:24.200 --> 49:29.760]  orish in the middle class as the elite to take those people out that are historically the
[49:29.760 --> 49:35.880]  only opposition to tyranny yeah it's class warfare it's race warfare if and when hillary
[49:35.880 --> 49:42.000]  gets in it will be gender warfare any means possible to divide us against each other while
[49:42.000 --> 49:47.880]  the elite move to their ivory towers and replace all the jobs with robots and they've openly
[49:47.880 --> 49:52.560]  said as you know paul the elite are quite public about this they believe we have a right
[49:52.560 --> 49:58.880]  to be warned but then they'll separately when we warn people they'll say it doesn't exist
[49:58.880 --> 50:05.000]  no it again if you read foreign affairs publication of the cfr it was in there again this month
[50:05.000 --> 50:09.000]  i read it before bill deberg about how all the jobs were going to be replaced by robots
[50:09.000 --> 50:12.880]  and it's going to cause massive riots they know that's going to happen but it's just
[50:12.880 --> 50:17.640]  going along full steam so they openly talk about it in their own publications knowing
[50:17.640 --> 50:22.880]  that everyone's distracted with katelyn jenner and the Kardashians and everything and that's
[50:22.880 --> 50:29.640]  how they get away with it and that's why we hijack katelyn jenner crap or whatever her
[50:29.640 --> 50:37.060]  name is is so we can reach into people in the matrix and try to get in there with topics
[50:37.060 --> 50:41.080]  they understand and then hopefully get them to pay attention to real issues i want to
[50:41.080 --> 50:45.660]  come back and tell folks about the new satire video paul that you've put out that's on info

[01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:33.880]  let the chips fall where they may here's paul watson's new satire character it's up on info
[01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:44.480]  wars dot com the truth about trans everything hey y'all my name is manjaina and i'm a gender
[01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:48.680]  fluid two-spirit transracial muslim atheist other contaminants anti-racist social justice
[01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:55.920]  warrior and i want to reveal to you my trans odyssey and how i've overcome hatred and
[01:00:55.920 --> 01:01:06.160]  bigotry to truly embrace who i really am on mondays i identify as cis gender white male
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:13.200]  this is so i can lecture everyone on twitter about how they need to check their white privilege
[01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:20.680]  and their sexist patriarchal racist rhetoric some people say i do this because i am a white
[01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:29.520]  knight and because i can't get pussy these people hate women and in my perfect world
[01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:38.360]  their misogyny would not be tolerated until then i identify as transracial just like
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:47.120]  my heroine rachel bezioff hey rachel in my heart i truly know i am african-american
[01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:55.400]  being transracial on tuesdays is nearly coming handy when applying for educational
[01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:58.960]  application because of all the wonderful applications
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:03.360]  i'm not mad at paul and he can do what he wants with his youtube channel but this is
[01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:08.360]  one of his more racy ones and so we're delaying that for radio stations because things are
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:16.880]  so politically correct but pretty funny paul it'll certainly get people talking but finishing
[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:23.680]  up with this they've taken our real rights away to an economy to health to a family to
[01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:31.100]  not having a devalued currency to having privacy and they're replacing it with faux rights
[01:02:31.100 --> 01:02:36.360]  and putting people into little servile groups this is the broken coalition plan for the
[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:41.240]  planet that larry nickles talked about go ahead no that's exactly what they've done
[01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:48.040]  with the fat pride movement they've created a whole social justice movement based around
[01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:53.160]  a condition that's incredibly unhealthy and leads to premature death to the point now
[01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:58.600]  where in britain recently we had a poster campaign for a organization a company called
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:04.560]  protein world which featured a you know a thin shapely model and it said are you beach
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:10.800]  body ready this created a massive controversy it was defaced by feminists they actually
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:15.720]  put in a bomb threat against the company of course it completely backfired they made about
[01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:19.320]  a million pounds more than they would have done otherwise now it they're putting it up
[01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:24.360]  in new york but again you know feminists will openly promote something that's incredibly
[01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:31.400]  harmful to women obesity and then label it as some social justice cause while ignoring
[01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:36.560]  all the genuine threats to women's rights you know Saudi Arabia banning female drivers
[01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:41.480]  the female genital in fact I was about to mention this Kuwait court orders female activists
[01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:47.920]  jailed for criticizing a mere AFP zero coverage of women not allowed to drive they'd rather
[01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:52.680]  lecture the west where women got all their freedom we I mean let's face the west isn't
[01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:58.800]  perfect but the west brought so much freedom to the world so we kind of henpeck ourselves
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:05.240]  that we weren't perfect and then these feminist worship the radical Islamist yeah and they
[01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:10.160]  create this complete fabrication that there's a rape culture in the west they say that one
[01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:15.560]  in four women are raped completely bogus statistics and in the Middle Eastern Africa in these
[01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:21.600]  places where there is an actual rape culture it's completely ignored but those men aren't
[01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:27.920]  white so it's okay yeah and this this is all coming out of the education system it's I
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:32.560]  mean Hillary Clinton is going to run on the gender pay gap myth so when people say oh why
[01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:36.440]  don't you just ignore these people well no they actually now have influence this is all
[01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:42.080]  coming up out of the education system Hillary's gonna run on this feminist platform so gender
[01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:46.560]  relations are going to get worse just as race relations have got worse under Obama when
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:51.760]  Hillary gets in that's all divide and conquer well your video is very interesting Paul
[01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:56.960]  don't get too racy now we have a family friendly transmission but great job we'll be back with

[01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:14.400]  weekend in Detroit and Philadelphia but were barely covered at all despite the fact that
[01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:20.800]  19 people were shot and one person was killed in Detroit Saturday night one person was killed
[01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:27.120]  and nine were wounded after a block party turned into a mass shooting Detroit police chief James
[01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:33.680]  Craig labeled the culprits as urban terrorist a similar situation unfolded in Philadelphia
[01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:40.800]  when a block party descended into chaos 10 people were hospitalized including three children
[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:45.480]  you will not hear about this however from the corporate media which continues to project
[01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:51.320]  the narrative that black people are being unfairly targeted by predominantly white police officers

[01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:32.760]  chief global strategist of euro pacific capital ink a broker dealer based in westport connecticut
[01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:37.440]  and i'm not going to go over his whole bio he's well known on the financial shows made

[01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:49.240]  is a strong supporter of the austrian school of economic thought first introduced to him
[01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:54.200]  by his father that has been fighting this whole tyranny for about 45 years i should
[01:08:54.200 --> 01:09:01.040]  add that and he joins us for the balance of the hour there is so much to get into i want
[01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:07.080]  to ask him what he thinks is front and center but first off mainstream media is saying global
[01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:12.920]  collapse by the end of the year next year much of the world's already collapsed if you're
[01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:18.520]  in the third world i mean it's just unprecedented middle east africa latin america it goes from
[01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:24.400]  depression to recession just pick your poison japan never came out of their recession but
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:29.040]  some will point to our economy go oh it's great yeah 0.2 growth rates earlier in the
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:33.920]  year and that's with cook numbers so remember we've got a lot of cook numbers i want things
[01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:39.360]  to be good i don't want the bubble to pop but we are on the biggest bubble in history
[01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:44.360]  and then now we've got headlines like this top ceo warns of global reset it's in the cards
[01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:50.120]  for sure it could happen this year bloomberg is reporting on texas wanting its billion
[01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:54.960]  in gold back from the private federal reserve germany's asked for its gold back that's bloomberg
[01:09:54.960 --> 01:10:00.760]  they won't give it back the chinese then the guardian reports that a lot of billionaires
[01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:05.880]  including top insiders are fleeing israel fleeing the u.s. fleeing and going to new zealand
[01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:10.200]  a lot of hollywood folks are going there i told you that first five years ago is this
[01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:16.760]  just hysteria and they've jumped the guide or can this bubble go on forever uh ron paul
[01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:21.240]  came out we played the clip friday it made headlines all over the world from the financial
[01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:27.480]  times of london to rt to cnbc ron paul quote economy will soon have a day of reckoning
[01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:32.240]  when you'll see the very very big crash i think we've got the congressman coming up later
[01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:36.040]  in the week or next week that's being lined up right now our former congressman so that's
[01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:41.200]  set in the table here that i'm not saying there's going to be a collapse i hope there
[01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:49.760]  isn't one but i've never seen so many mainline people saying it with now ap reporting the
[01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:55.720]  secretary of defense is sending commandos to basically fight the russians let's not
[01:10:55.720 --> 01:11:01.200]  pick a side in this this is crazy though i mean we're in their backyard uh it's it's
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:05.960]  just wild our government backing the muslim brotherhood al qaeda light all over the middle
[01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:11.160]  east i mean i've been doing this 20 years and i thought i had seen it all this is the
[01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:17.320]  craziest governments ever acted peter schiff am i overstating it understating it i mean
[01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:22.320]  as an expert as a smart guy you know proven himself in the real world what are you doing
[01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:28.200]  for yourself well i mean how would you boil it down where are we well first of all alex
[01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:34.520]  it's not about wanting the bubble to pop because all bubbles inevitably pop the problem is
[01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:39.320]  the bigger they get before they do pop the worse it is so we should want the bubble
[01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:44.160]  to pop now it should have popped years ago had it popped years ago we would have been
[01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:49.320]  able to solve our problems instead of making them worse so unfortunately we have delayed
[01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:52.920]  the day of reckoning and there's a lot more to reckon with and you know what congressman
[01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:57.040]  ron paul was talking about and of course i've been a pan fan of his for a long time it's
[01:11:57.040 --> 01:12:02.000]  nothing new i mean this collapse has been a long time in the making it's just that we're
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:07.520]  now closer to it because of all the things that we've done to delay that day of reckoning
[01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:13.000]  but that have simply worsened the very problems that make that day of reckoning unnecessary
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:18.400]  sure what do you say to people because i've seen this said about you said about me everybody
[01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:22.920]  you you're going to create bad confidence and make it pop as if we're the ones that
[01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:28.920]  did this now it's it's not all about confidence if we just believe in something that's phony
[01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:33.160]  that it's just going to sustain itself i mean that is a problem too many people believe
[01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:37.880]  all this nonsense which is one of the reasons that it's gotten so out of control but as
[01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:43.200]  a result all the problems have been exacerbated and the fact that we've been able to borrow
[01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:48.880]  all this money from around the world and spend it just means that we've got a bigger problem
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:52.840]  just like look look there's greeces in the news today because they're trying to solidify
[01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:58.480]  a bailout but the reason the greeks got themselves into such a big problem is because for years
[01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:02.720]  they kept borrowing money at artificially low interest rates well we've made the same
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:08.400]  problem it's just that our creditors haven't figured it out yet and so they're still willing
[01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:12.520]  to loan us money even though we can't pay any of it back well they're clearly scared
[01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:16.840]  that if they don't prop us up it'll bring everything down but that only adds to washington's
[01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:23.880]  hubris and bizarre bizarre arrogance well yeah and of course the longer it takes the
[01:13:23.880 --> 01:13:29.040]  more false confidence it builds and you know a lot of people have begun to criticize me
[01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:33.880]  over the last few years saying oh peter's chef and of course not just me but other people
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:38.320]  have been predicting this gloom and doom and you see nothing bad has happened and so they're
[01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:43.640]  wrong but meanwhile a lot of bad stuff has happened we have this phony recovery the real
[01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:49.520]  economy is weakening despite all of the doctored up statistics the average man in the street
[01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:55.440]  is worse off his network is going down he's got a lower paying job he's got no savings
[01:13:55.440 --> 01:14:00.600]  he's loaded up with debt this thing is a ticking time bomb the fact that the fuse is a little
[01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:07.240]  bit longer than some of us might have guessed doesn't under you know undercut the reality
[01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:13.680]  it just means with all the new banking manipulations and insider trading and derivatives and all
[01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:17.560]  the rest of it they've been able to prop it up longer but every analyst out there pretty
[01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:21.280]  much says that when it finally goes under unless you're talking about Krugman or something
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:27.000]  that it's going to be spectacular what does it signify then that so many mainline analysts
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:32.800]  and people and even folks that pushed all this kinsley and economics garbage are now
[01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:37.480]  saying we're in deep trouble wealth inequities and all the rest of it it seems like they're
[01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:42.080]  trying to have their cake and eat it too that signifies to me that we are getting close
[01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:47.520]  to the bubble popping well the fact that so many people refuse to acknowledge that there
[01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:51.360]  is a bubble in the first place is more as a good contrarian indicator but you've got
[01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:56.000]  to remember that they never see the bubbles right the Federal Reserve certainly never
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:02.560]  sees them they're always in denial even after they pop you know go back to the great recession
[01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:09.880]  of 2008 financial crisis nobody at the Fed saw that coming in fact by mid 2008 they still
[01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:14.600]  had no recession anywhere in their forecast despite the fact that we were seven months
[01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:20.320]  in to the greatest recession since the Great Depression they were clueless even we talked
[01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:25.160]  about you know the you mentioned earlier the negative GDP in the first quarter well halfway
[01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:30.120]  through the first quarter the Fed was still predicting growth of near 3% so they have no
[01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:35.560]  idea what's going to happen and even if they do the last thing they're going to do is admit
[01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:39.760]  it if they see problems on the horizon they're going to deny it they're going to pretend
[01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:43.720]  everything is great because they do believe it's a confidence game and the last thing
[01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:50.760]  they want to do is pierce that confidence bubble what do you make of all the bizarre
[01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:55.840]  geopolitical actions that are going on is that an attempt to sure up the dollar a and
[01:15:55.840 --> 01:16:04.040]  then be for lay folks out there what is the bubble or bubbles and what type of event do
[01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:08.400]  you think could precipitate that why are they saying so many analysts now the end of this
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:13.320]  year is a prime zone for a bubble pop well I didn't even know that many analysts were
[01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:17.840]  saying that I think that's still probably a small minority of opinion most of the analysts
[01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:22.480]  are still cheerleading this funny recovery they're convinced that it's real but you know
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:26.880]  when you put your finger on the dollar that's been a big key to this the dollar has had
[01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:32.560]  a very you know significant rise over the last couple of years although it hasn't been
[01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:37.480]  rising since March it kind of peaked out in March but the basis of the dollar rally was
[01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:42.160]  the false confidence in the US economy and that generally held view that the Fed was
[01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:46.360]  now going to start raising interest rates and shrinking down its balance sheet because
[01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:50.280]  it has fixed all the problems well the reality is it didn't fix the problems it made them
[01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:55.640]  all worse and so now it can't shrink its balance sheet it can't raise interest rates without
[01:16:55.640 --> 01:17:00.720]  precipitating a worse financial crisis than 2008 the markets haven't come to terms with
[01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:05.280]  this reality yet but eventually they will figure out that this is all talk that the Fed can't
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:08.960]  raise rates because we're too addicted to cheap money we're going to have to have another
[01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:14.800]  injection of QE4 to keep the bubble from deflating and when that happens the bottom will drop
[01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:19.000]  out of the dollar and that's what's going to usher in the real crash that I wrote about
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:23.720]  it's a you know the title of my most recent book you know the real crash of America's
[01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:28.520]  coming bankruptcy how to save yourself and your country is all about the economic collapse
[01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:34.040]  that happens when the bottom drops out of the dollar because reality finally sets in.
[01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:38.160]  I want to spend a lot of the time today on your book and tell folks they want to really
[01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:43.880]  get prepared where to get it I mean I just feel so bad because I mean historically there's
[01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:48.360]  no way this will go on forever as you said the longer it goes on the worse it's going
[01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:55.160]  to get the real crash how to save yourself and your country Peter D. Schiff New York
[01:17:55.160 --> 01:18:00.360]  Times bestselling author on with us right now before we go to break though surely you've
[01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:05.000]  seen the articles you manage a lot of rich people's money London Guardian you name it
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:10.920]  and admits what we already knew with a lot of rich people are getting armored redoubts
[01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:18.800]  in the Ozarks or in Montana or in New Zealand or they're building safe houses they're acting
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:24.200]  really paranoid they're pulling cash out they're pulling gold out while criticizing gold what
[01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:30.920]  do you make of that fear under the surface or is it not that bad well look I think there's
[01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:35.840]  a lot of reasons to be concerned I mean some people might be more concerned than others
[01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:39.520]  to the extent that they have these types of plans but you know some people might think
[01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:43.640]  that's radical but I think what's even more radical is thinking everything is great and
[01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:48.120]  doing nothing to protect yourself you know the vast majority of wealthy people aren't
[01:18:48.120 --> 01:18:51.720]  going to be wealthy in a few years they're going to be wiped out I mean they may have
[01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:56.400]  all of their dollars you might still have millions of dollars in treasuries and you
[01:18:56.400 --> 01:19:01.760]  know in CDs or in your annuities it's like having a trunk full of confederacy notes at
[01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:06.640]  the end of civil war yeah it'll be it'll be the same thing or like having a wheelbarrow
[01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:11.400]  full of Reichmarks or a bunch of Zimbabwe dollars I mean people have to understand that
[01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:17.240]  the history of fiat currency is not good and people that don't perceive and act upon these
[01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:22.160]  threats you know end up with severe losses and you know the US government has borrowed
[01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:28.160]  way beyond its capacity to repay the only avenue politically expedient is inflation
[01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:33.200]  and it is going to happen and I think we're on the doorstep of a currency crisis that
[01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:37.520]  will wipe out the wealth of the vast majority of Americans who are foolish enough to store
[01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:42.920]  their wealth in US currency so what I'm helping my clients to do the wealthy and not so wealthy
[01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:46.240]  is to get their financial assets out of harm's way.
[01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:49.360]  Alright let's talk about that when we come back.

[01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:15.400]  pickpocketing I didn't realize there was such a thing as electronic pickpocketing what
[01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:20.200]  is that well apparently many of the new credit and debit cards being issued have radio chips
[01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:26.440]  inside them called RFID the transmitter banking information to card readers when we pay unfortunately
[01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:30.760]  a bad guy can also get one of these readers and go around the city scanning people collecting
[01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:36.240]  their credit card numbers and personal information without us knowing it wow that sounds scary
[01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:40.280]  since you're getting a new wallet anyway you should definitely get an ID stronghold shielded

[01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:29.000]  fund manager made a lot of accurate predictions predicted a few years ago that we'd see a
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:33.920]  larger collapse in the West than we've seen so far but that's what a lot of other people
[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:39.560]  said I mean we've never seen a bubble that I've studied in history get this big that's
[01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:47.160]  across the board in bonds and in the currencies and just just just everywhere it is it is
[01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:50.800]  La La land because when the music stops it's going to be spectacular so when I ask you
[01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:55.440]  in the next segment what he thinks different scenarios are collapses could look like not
[01:24:55.440 --> 01:25:00.400]  predictions but what they could look like how we can protect ourselves individually
[01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:05.680]  we're going to talk about that right now in his book but at the same time I've just got
[01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:10.640]  so many questions because I wish there was some way to stop the bubble I mean he makes
[01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:14.880]  the point that it needs to go ahead and just pop I wish there was a way to just freeze
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:20.640]  it and then slowly deflate it he was saying earlier it needed to pop a long time ago that's
[01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:24.960]  what Ron Paul and others are saying as well how would we have gotten out of this if we
[01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:31.280]  would have popped it 345 years ago and how would have that been better versus now well
[01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:36.160]  you know the last good opportunity to pop it was in the aftermath of the bursting of
[01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:42.520]  the real estate bubble and during the financial crisis of 0809 unfortunately there was more
[01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:47.840]  pain that needed to be had at that time and a lot of people who speculated should have
[01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:51.280]  lost a lot of money there should have been a lot of financial institutions that should
[01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:55.040]  have been allowed to fail and a lot of people should have lost a lot more money than they
[01:25:55.040 --> 01:26:00.000]  did instead you know the middle class suffered and a lot of the wealthy people who gambled
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:05.320]  so badly with cheap money from the government were rewarded for all their risk taking and
[01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:10.880]  now they're taking even more risk but you know you can't just slowly deflate a bubble
[01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:17.440]  right you got to let it pop that is the problem because the bubble the activities that comprise
[01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:23.920]  the bubble are preventing legitimate economic activity from taking place so as the Fed directs
[01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:29.920]  resources or misdirects resources to sustaining bubbles the resources that are necessary for
[01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:35.640]  legitimate economic growth wealth creation good paying jobs those resources are no longer
[01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:41.920]  available so the quicker the bubble pops the better the problem is the political you know
[01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:48.600]  carnage here is too much for anybody to want to own up to so instead we kick the can down
[01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:53.360]  the road but you know we're rapidly running out of road and that can is you know getting
[01:26:53.360 --> 01:27:01.320]  bigger and bigger certainly well said and I mean obviously it needs to pop it should
[01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:08.320]  have popped folks don't want the political pain but when it does collapse what do you
[01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:12.200]  expect it to look like I mean a lot of the public really are spoiled brats and it's
[01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:19.800]  so wrong to take taxpayer money and our children's future to bail out billionaires and yuppies
[01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:25.320]  and people I mean that really is obscene and will will they get away with another banker
[01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:29.560]  bail out next time that's three four times bigger I mean maybe they've set up a scenario
[01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:35.440]  where everything has to be sacrificed to this black hole well I think the one thing that
[01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:39.720]  will be sacrifices the value of the dollar and of course everybody will suffer who is
[01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:44.760]  not prepared but I think the government is already all in on this bad monetary policy
[01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:49.400]  they are going to you know keep this monetary pedal to the metal at all costs so they're
[01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:53.880]  going to keep interest rates at zero or practically zero they're going to do QE for they're going
[01:27:53.880 --> 01:27:58.680]  to do QE five they're going to do everything they can to stop the real estate bubble from
[01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:04.160]  deflating to stop the stock bubble from deflating to stop the bond bubble from deflating to keep
[01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:09.720]  this whole house of cards propped up as long as possible and what they have to do is sacrifice
[01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:15.000]  the dollar in order to sustain everything else but ultimately when the dollar goes everything
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:18.800]  goes because it doesn't matter if you still have your money in the bond market if the
[01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:23.200]  money isn't worth anything right so once the dollar collapses because they have to print
[01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:28.760]  so many of them to keep all the other bubbles from bursting then the dollar bubble is ultimately
[01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:33.400]  the one that goes and that does the most damage because what it's going to do is dramatically
[01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:37.720]  increase the cost of living I mean the Federal Reserve is pretending there's no inflation
[01:28:37.720 --> 01:28:42.360]  right now but the average American knows how much his cost of living is going up well you
[01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:47.240]  ain't seen nothing yet way to the cost of living doubles triples quintuples or more
[01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:51.580]  as a result of a plunging dollar Americans are going to see their standard of living
[01:28:51.580 --> 01:28:59.120]  permanently reduced in a very dramatic way and I would expect massive crime waves well
[01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:03.480]  probably we already have you know a lot of crime but it's going to get a lot worse especially
[01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:08.400]  when people start blaming somebody you know we've created a society of entitlement where
[01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:12.360]  people just expect that they've got something coming to them and where they don't get it
[01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:15.560]  you know when all these government benefits are no longer valuable because they don't
[01:29:15.560 --> 01:29:20.320]  buy anything because there's nothing available to buy with dollars yes a lot of people are
[01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:25.480]  going to be frustrated and they're going to take those frustrations to the streets.
[01:29:25.480 --> 01:29:29.040]  Massive civil unrest which the government not just here but around the world are gearing
[01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:33.360]  up for and I know Peter you like to say it's incompetence but at a certain level it's
[01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:38.920]  a mix of incompetence and organized thought here because I mean the Pentagon admits they're
[01:29:38.920 --> 01:29:42.960]  preparing for civil unrest and collapse show to the British intel I want to ask you about
[01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:47.000]  that we come back and get into your book what you recommend people do to protect themselves
[01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:48.800]  stay with us.

[01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:11.520]  Rand Paul linking the presidential candidate to a white supremacy group a new report reveals
[01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:17.520]  that Rand Paul's political action committee accepted a donation from the council of conservative
[01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:23.400]  citizens a group that was also mentioned in a manifesto written by Dylan Roof the let's
[01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:31.440]  Charleston South Carolina church shooter Paul's campaign said it will donate the $1750 it received
[01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:36.520]  from the group to the mother Emanuel Hope fund but regardless Paul's opponents will
[01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:42.160]  use this story in an attempt to sabotage his presidential bid Paul has also joined the
[01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:48.040]  fight to release the secret 28 pages missing from the official 9 11 report which will prove

[01:35:57.800 --> 01:36:01.760]  because if your thyroid's full a bunch of other bad stuff I mean I detoxed two weeks
[01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:07.120]  into it for about a week it felt terrible and then I had so much more energy in fourslife.com
[01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:09.760]  and if you like if you didn't have vitamin C you'd have holes in your arms and your teeth

[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:55.880]  so thank you so much. EuroPAC.net I'm going to try to shut up and give Peter Schiff for
[01:36:55.880 --> 01:37:00.120]  about 15 minutes of this segment that's left it's a long segment the floor to really get
[01:37:00.120 --> 01:37:04.040]  into what he thinks is most important to talk about how he's protecting himself what he's
[01:37:04.040 --> 01:37:11.080]  telling his clients you can also go to Euro Pacific if you'd like to be one of his clients
[01:37:11.080 --> 01:37:15.040]  I want to give him the floor so it's not just me here a layman asking the questions we're
[01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:20.720]  going to go to him in a second but first since I mentioned it because I noticed on infowords.com
[01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:25.960]  a comment on one of the articles going I just heard Jones say that Ron Paul says the stock
[01:37:25.960 --> 01:37:29.840]  market is going to be in trouble soon you know I didn't hear that so we'll just play
[01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:35.160]  the clip from last Thursday on Ron Paul's own TV show where he said it's all over the
[01:37:35.160 --> 01:37:39.120]  news and just because people are ignorant and don't know about it doesn't mean we're
[01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:43.760]  lying here's what Ron Paul had to say it could be tomorrow could be a month it could be a
[01:37:43.760 --> 01:37:50.320]  couple years from now because it all depends on a psychological acceptance of the system
[01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:54.640]  so a lot of people who are still making a lot of money know the system is not going to
[01:37:54.640 --> 01:37:59.680]  last but they figure well if everybody else thinks it's going to last they just keep owning
[01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:06.480]  bonds and buying stocks today they're buying stocks and yet next week they may sell them
[01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:11.640]  all again so no I don't think there's any way to know what the time is but you know
[01:38:11.640 --> 01:38:19.200]  after 35 years of a gigantic bull market in bonds believe me they cannot reverse history
[01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:25.280]  and you cannot print money forever and deceive the markets forever eventually the markets
[01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:30.720]  will rule and that's only a question of when that will happen and of course I run a little
[01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:35.400]  bit scared because I think there will be a day of reckoning.
[01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:39.280]  Let's get your comment on that and then I want you to cover the angles you think are
[01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:45.400]  most important Peter Schiff well of course you know Ron Paul has been giving these warnings
[01:38:45.400 --> 01:38:50.160]  for a long time as have I you know you remember Ron Paul was warning about the problems that
[01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:56.680]  Fannie and Freddie you know as early publicly as 2002 of course it took until 2008 for those
[01:38:56.680 --> 01:39:01.520]  warnings to come to fruition but you know whenever you understand a problem you always
[01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:07.120]  understand it early and that allows your critics to claim that you're wrong because the problem
[01:39:07.120 --> 01:39:11.560]  gets bigger while you're warning about it but of course then when it blows up they claim
[01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:15.360]  that nobody could have predicted this and they call the people who did well they're
[01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:20.360]  stop clocks you know they've been saying it for so long and so who cares but the only
[01:39:20.360 --> 01:39:25.600]  stop clocks the people who constantly try to tell us that everything is fine and that
[01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:28.960]  the government has solved our problems and that the Federal Reserve is doing the right
[01:39:28.960 --> 01:39:35.040]  thing so Ron Paul is right I think the problem is even bigger than he's probably letting
[01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:39.840]  on I think you know he's afraid to really say just how bad it really is but it is pretty
[01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:44.240]  bad and yes we don't know exactly when it's gonna happen and you know one thing I want
[01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:48.600]  to point out you mentioned before the break that you thought that this is kind of being
[01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:53.320]  done deliberately by our leaders like they're set out to erect the country you know our leaders
[01:39:53.320 --> 01:39:57.880]  are so incompetent I don't think they can do this by design if they actually want to
[01:39:57.880 --> 01:40:01.400]  direct the country we'd probably be in good shape because they would achieve the opposite
[01:40:01.400 --> 01:40:07.920]  so I think it's a case you know it's a case of bad intentions you know they think they're
[01:40:07.920 --> 01:40:12.800]  doing the right thing and then they get committed and they're committed to a strategy and they
[01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:17.320]  get deeper and deeper and deeper into it because they never want to acknowledge that they were
[01:40:17.320 --> 01:40:21.680]  wrong so rather than admitting the mistakes they keep on you know doubling down on the
[01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:27.240]  same losing strategy and ultimately it is gonna blow up and your listeners need to do
[01:40:27.240 --> 01:40:31.320]  something they need to take action because we don't know when this day of reckoning is
[01:40:31.320 --> 01:40:36.840]  gonna come it could come next week it could come next year but you know you you can either
[01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:41.800]  prepare too early or too late and too late isn't gonna work so you gotta be too early
[01:40:41.800 --> 01:40:48.240]  there's so many questions I could ask but I'd like to get into what you think is front
[01:40:48.240 --> 01:40:51.800]  and center what you'd like to impart to the audience I mean obviously I could ask the
[01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:59.560]  question of if they're not trying to wreck things intentionally they certainly profit
[01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:04.920]  off the crises though every time because they always get bailed out oh yeah look they never
[01:41:04.920 --> 01:41:10.320]  want to let a crisis go to waste and I always remember you know what Harry Brown used to
[01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:14.520]  say about you know the government is great at breaking your leg and then handing you
[01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:19.360]  a crutch and saying you see without me you couldn't walk so yes the government always
[01:41:19.360 --> 01:41:24.000]  benefits from the poverty they cause because now the impoverished look to government for
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:31.160]  a solution and so yes I mean it's a self-perpetuating spiral where the government benefits from
[01:41:31.160 --> 01:41:36.160]  its own mistakes but people have to wake up to the reality that it is the government
[01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:40.360]  that broke their leg and without the government they would have two good legs and they wouldn't
[01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:44.560]  need this ridiculous government crutch and they'd be hobbling around on it and thanking
[01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:49.040]  the government for this crutch but instead of you know they could thank the free market
[01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:53.160]  for having two healthy strong legs that you know where they wouldn't need any kind of
[01:41:53.160 --> 01:41:57.880]  any kind of crutch but that's not going to happen right we're going to have this crisis
[01:41:57.880 --> 01:42:01.480]  there's nothing you can do about it there's nothing I can do about it there's nothing
[01:42:01.480 --> 01:42:06.840]  your listeners can do about it we can't stop it but we can certainly prepare for it ourselves
[01:42:06.840 --> 01:42:12.240]  and limit the damage to ourselves so that we're in a position to help clean up the mess
[01:42:12.240 --> 01:42:17.680]  when could we have stopped it when could we have stopped it we you and me never they're
[01:42:17.680 --> 01:42:21.360]  not going to take us seriously we're going to be relegated to the fringes sure but I
[01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:27.600]  meant the system I mean if they weren't insane when when could they have currently what would
[01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:32.320]  smart economic policy be from your perspective no one could deny free markets only problem
[01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:38.120]  is it creates so much wealth our kids become spoiled brats I mean communism is a joke socialism
[01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:44.360]  is a disaster free market creates just over the top wealth prosperity choices and so that's
[01:42:44.360 --> 01:42:48.600]  why every spoiled rotten you know college kid who hadn't worked in three generations
[01:42:48.600 --> 01:42:52.280]  bad mouths it because they're idiots but you know so many spoiled rotten kids are part
[01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:56.400]  of the communists per gauge now literally here in Austin marching around with red flags
[01:42:56.400 --> 01:43:01.160]  it's hilarious if it wasn't so scary I mean I'm kind of ranting here it's just free market
[01:43:01.160 --> 01:43:05.600]  works so good why aren't we doing it then meanwhile the free markets getting blamed
[01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:10.840]  for people that aren't following it yeah you know it's not popular with the voters that's
[01:43:10.840 --> 01:43:15.400]  the problem politicians promising freedom don't get elected they want to promise something
[01:43:15.400 --> 01:43:21.440]  for nothing but the good news is capitalism works so well that as soon as we try it right
[01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:26.360]  we can really solve these problems very quickly I mean look how some of these countries like
[01:43:26.360 --> 01:43:31.800]  Japan or or West Germany look at how quickly they rose from the asses of the second world
[01:43:31.800 --> 01:43:36.760]  war I mean their countries were bombed you know back to the stone age nothing was standing
[01:43:36.760 --> 01:43:43.200]  yeah so we're we are not in a situation anywhere near that bad all we need is the freedom to
[01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:48.320]  pull ourselves out of this government created you know gigantic hole but you know we still
[01:43:48.320 --> 01:43:52.240]  dig it deeper because politically that's the easiest thing to do but when could we
[01:43:52.240 --> 01:43:55.480]  have stopped it look we could have stopped at any time there was a political will to
[01:43:55.480 --> 01:44:00.480]  stop it but unfortunately there's been people around the world willing to loan us more money
[01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:04.700]  so we don't have to do it it's like when is a drug addict you know finally go to rehab
[01:44:04.700 --> 01:44:09.360]  normally he has to hit rock bottom before he does that his wife has to leave him he's
[01:44:09.360 --> 01:44:13.640]  got to lose his job you know he wakes up in you know in his street somewhere he has no
[01:44:13.640 --> 01:44:18.640]  memories is in a pile of his own vomit in urine and then maybe finally when he's lost
[01:44:18.640 --> 01:44:23.520]  it all he finally goes into rehab and maybe gets his life turned around we're probably
[01:44:23.520 --> 01:44:28.440]  gonna have to reach that's that that point is a nation that's the point but individually
[01:44:28.440 --> 01:44:32.560]  we don't have to do that right we could get rid of our dollars now there are countries
[01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:37.200]  around the world people can invest in places like Switzerland and Singapore and New Zealand
[01:44:37.200 --> 01:44:41.360]  and Hong Kong and other countries around the world they're not nearly as screwed up as
[01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:45.720]  we are their currencies are in better shape their economies are in better shape they have
[01:44:45.720 --> 01:44:50.800]  more economic freedom than we do you can buy gold you can buy silver you can own assets
[01:44:50.800 --> 01:44:55.400]  around the world so you don't have to go down with this with this ship and so you're in
[01:44:55.400 --> 01:44:59.480]  a lifeboat yourselves and you can help other people out of the water so that they don't
[01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:07.200]  drown I know you don't give me like individual advice over the air it's impossible but let's
[01:45:07.200 --> 01:45:13.280]  say you know hypothetical person out there whatever hypothetical scenario you come up
[01:45:13.280 --> 01:45:17.320]  with what would you be doing right now to protect your assets where do you think the
[01:45:17.320 --> 01:45:21.360]  best investments are what do you think is going to be in trouble during this implosion
[01:45:21.360 --> 01:45:26.480]  what's going to be doing good during the implosion yeah well I think all dollar denominated assets
[01:45:26.480 --> 01:45:30.840]  particularly debt instruments are going to lose the most in terms of real purchasing
[01:45:30.840 --> 01:45:35.720]  power and what I would invite your listeners to do is individually talk to our representatives
[01:45:35.720 --> 01:45:41.720]  at your pacific capital your pack dot com you know we tailor portfolios for people you
[01:45:41.720 --> 01:45:45.280]  know our minimums for my mutual funds there was lowest twenty five hundred dollars and
[01:45:45.280 --> 01:45:50.440]  I have mutual funds that are designed specifically to protect you from the problems that I see
[01:45:50.440 --> 01:45:54.000]  coming and then we have separately managed accounts where the minimums are two hundred
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:58.840]  fifty thousand and we have solutions you know for people in various amounts of money fifty
[01:45:58.840 --> 01:46:03.880]  thousand one hundred thousand the important thing is to protect the purchasing power
[01:46:03.880 --> 01:46:08.280]  of what you work so hard to save a lot of people are going to watch the value of their
[01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:12.600]  savings evaporate so many people are focused on preserving their principal I don't want
[01:46:12.600 --> 01:46:17.040]  to lose any money well that's not going to be any good if your money loses value so
[01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:22.000]  you've got to think outside the box and you've got to prepare for the real crisis that nobody
[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:25.840]  is worried about that nobody is predicting people are thinking oh what if the stock market
[01:46:25.840 --> 01:46:30.320]  crashes what if the real estate market crashes those were the last bubbles that burst this
[01:46:30.320 --> 01:46:34.880]  one is much bigger and even if those bubbles don't burst because the Fed fills them with
[01:46:34.880 --> 01:46:39.480]  so much air by printing so much money it's not going to matter when the dollar collapses
[01:46:39.480 --> 01:46:43.920]  that is the biggest threat that people face particularly if you're planning on retiring
[01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:48.920]  you know I think retirement in America is going to go the way of the single family household
[01:46:48.920 --> 01:46:52.840]  you know once upon a time in America if you were a guy and you had a job your wife didn't
[01:46:52.840 --> 01:46:57.400]  need to work now most people's wives have to work and they can still barely make ends
[01:46:57.400 --> 01:47:02.400]  meet but at one time Americans could actually stop working and enjoy their golden years
[01:47:02.400 --> 01:47:06.680]  that's not going to happen anymore I mean you know pretty soon if you if somebody sees
[01:47:06.680 --> 01:47:10.560]  somebody retired on an old sitcom they're not even going to know what that is it's
[01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:13.840]  like hey why is that person not working what are they doing you know why don't they have
[01:47:13.840 --> 01:47:18.560]  a job you know oh that's called retirement that used to happen in America but you know
[01:47:18.560 --> 01:47:22.600]  nobody retired people are going to have to work every day until they drop dead because
[01:47:22.600 --> 01:47:26.240]  they're not going to be able to have enough purchasing power to buy the things that they
[01:47:26.240 --> 01:47:30.600]  need to sustain themselves in retirement so those are the people who are most important
[01:47:30.600 --> 01:47:34.280]  you know you mentioned the young people the young people can leave they can pick up and
[01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:39.560]  move out of this country just like my grandparents came here looking for opportunity our grandkids
[01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:44.320]  can leave in pursuit of the same thing it's the people that can't leave that have already
[01:47:44.320 --> 01:47:48.920]  spent the lifetime working to build up a nest egg you know that nest egg can crack it'll
[01:47:48.920 --> 01:47:56.840]  be rotten if you don't do something to protect it it's so sad and of course what's taken
[01:47:56.840 --> 01:48:03.640]  our money and devalued it is all this inflation and it's all the regulations and bureaucracy
[01:48:03.640 --> 01:48:09.400]  to where people have to work so many jobs it's clear big government regulations insider
[01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:14.000]  grips being exempt has caused this uneven playing field I have two questions for you
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:18.520]  Peter Schiff again folks you're a pack dot net who's joining us here major fund manager
[01:48:18.520 --> 01:48:26.320]  a why are the Texas government and other governments asking for their gold from the
[01:48:26.320 --> 01:48:30.560]  fellow reserve why is the New York Fed saying we're not going to give it to you or we're
[01:48:30.560 --> 01:48:36.560]  going to give it to you a little bit a year over the next decade what does that expose
[01:48:36.560 --> 01:48:42.320]  why do we hear all these big banks calling for an end of cash calling for bail ins again
[01:48:42.320 --> 01:48:48.040]  in Europe with Greece I want to talk about that and then I want to ask the other question
[01:48:48.040 --> 01:48:54.000]  which is the argument that the fact that our bond market is so weak the fact that the dollar
[01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:59.320]  is so weak everybody's scared and it's propping it up and we'll just keep propping it up because
[01:48:59.320 --> 01:49:05.440]  they don't want everything to come down yeah well well first of all the dollar has been
[01:49:05.440 --> 01:49:10.400]  propped up recently it's not as weak as it would be if people understood the predicament
[01:49:10.400 --> 01:49:14.440]  it's because people have a false sense of confidence in the U.S. economy and because
[01:49:14.440 --> 01:49:18.800]  they believe the Fed is actually going to embark on a rate hiking campaign that's the
[01:49:18.800 --> 01:49:22.920]  reason for the dollar's strength or at least relative strength and that's what's been keeping
[01:49:22.920 --> 01:49:27.560]  this whole thing from collapsing it's keeping people buying into our bond market it's propping
[01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:31.800]  up our economy it's making it possible for Americans to buy things even though we don't
[01:49:31.800 --> 01:49:36.440]  make them we can run these huge trade deficits because our creditors are willing to hold our
[01:49:36.440 --> 01:49:41.440]  currency instead of demanding payment and actual good sure but they're not trying to
[01:49:41.440 --> 01:49:46.480]  save us though every time it goes down they run in and buy it well well they haven't had
[01:49:46.480 --> 01:49:51.240]  new recently because there's a lot of fools a lot of currency speculators have been buying
[01:49:51.240 --> 01:49:55.400]  but you know currency speculators have been wrong in the past they've overestimated the
[01:49:55.400 --> 01:49:59.720]  strength of the U.S. economy and they've done it again and I think the dollar is on the
[01:49:59.720 --> 01:50:04.640]  verge of a collapse and again that is going to be the real crisis as to why Texas or
[01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:08.520]  anybody else is demanding that the Federal Reserve return their gold I think they're
[01:50:08.520 --> 01:50:12.680]  worried that the gold is not actually there you know this we're getting closer and closer
[01:50:12.680 --> 01:50:17.440]  to a real crisis and it's people around the world want to actually have their gold because
[01:50:17.440 --> 01:50:21.920]  the problem is where there isn't a rush back to gold and out of fiat currencies which may
[01:50:21.920 --> 01:50:26.560]  not just be the dollar but the euro the yen there are a lot of currencies that have problems
[01:50:26.560 --> 01:50:31.560]  but I think the dollar's problem dwarfs all the others but the other problem other currency
[01:50:31.560 --> 01:50:36.240]  suffer from the same disease but when there's a real rush back into gold there's no gold
[01:50:36.240 --> 01:50:40.960]  there's not nearly enough gold to go around let's talk about that yeah one final segment
[01:50:40.960 --> 01:50:44.800]  with Peter Schiff back in three minutes I want to break down precious metals it's come
[01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:48.480]  out they've been artificially depressing it just like they've been rigging the currency
[01:50:48.480 --> 01:50:53.440]  markets and interest rates I mean that's now all admitted where is that going and is the
[01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:57.560]  real rush to get physical gold out of the Federal Reserve vaults a sign of a rush to
[01:50:57.560 --> 01:51:03.360]  the exits communist China freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates while our
[01:51:03.360 --> 01:51:07.920]  US politicians argue from banning Americans from owning body armor does that sound right

[01:54:41.760 --> 01:54:49.040]  this other economic military news we haven't gotten to earth inner six extinction phase
[01:54:49.040 --> 01:54:53.480]  with any species including our own labeled the walking dead that's a major new government
[01:54:53.480 --> 01:54:59.800]  report out by Stanford Princeton in Berkeley is it fair mongering or there's something
[01:54:59.800 --> 01:55:04.680]  really behind it I'll give you my take that's all coming up I just want to be clear about
[01:55:04.680 --> 01:55:09.840]  something here again I didn't build this system you didn't build it but we've all kind of
[01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:15.160]  collectively been part of it and I don't put all this news out trying to scare people
[01:55:15.160 --> 01:55:18.440]  it's like I called my neighbor because their house was on fire I'm not scaremongering there's
[01:55:18.440 --> 01:55:25.080]  flames coming out historically as Ron Paul said as Peter Schiff said this has always
[01:55:25.080 --> 01:55:32.240]  gone really disastrously and now it's gotten bigger than ever the establishment acts like
[01:55:32.240 --> 01:55:38.920]  it can go on forever while they hoard gold or hoard cash by farmland and build bunkers
[01:55:38.920 --> 01:55:47.240]  and try to act like they're nobody so I don't see them in their actions belying that they
[01:55:47.240 --> 01:55:50.880]  believe the confidence came they're pushing in the five minutes we've got left you're
[01:55:50.880 --> 01:55:55.920]  a pacific dot net his new book well it's been out for a while it's a bestseller the real
[01:55:55.920 --> 01:56:03.680]  crash how to save yourself your country Peter D Schiff in closing is this move to get the
[01:56:03.680 --> 01:56:07.400]  gold away from the Federal Reserve and these governments trying to hold more gold and UT
[01:56:07.400 --> 01:56:13.360]  buying gold and Texas wanting its gold back is that a move towards the exits and any other
[01:56:13.360 --> 01:56:18.280]  points you think are important to make well you know I think the movement started abroad
[01:56:18.280 --> 01:56:21.800]  member the Germans trying to get their goal but there are a lot of other foreign central
[01:56:21.800 --> 01:56:26.360]  banks that are not nearly as big players as the Bundesbank but they've been trying to
[01:56:26.360 --> 01:56:30.640]  repatriate their gold and get it out of the United States so it shows that people are
[01:56:30.640 --> 01:56:35.560]  beginning to doubt you know they're beginning to question whether the emperor has any clothes
[01:56:35.560 --> 01:56:39.200]  and so they're asking for their gold and that's one of the reasons that I think individuals
[01:56:39.200 --> 01:56:43.440]  should ask for their goal to mean a lot of individuals that's why we sell physical gold
[01:56:43.440 --> 01:56:47.320]  and recommend that people take delivery own your own gold right do what these central
[01:56:47.320 --> 01:56:51.680]  banks are doing don't necessarily trust to have all your gold in the hands of a third
[01:56:51.680 --> 01:56:56.600]  party and that includes US banks I would want to keep my golden and safety deposit box because
[01:56:56.600 --> 01:56:59.800]  you know if they ever confiscate it that's the first place they're going to look so you're
[01:56:59.800 --> 01:57:04.520]  not going to get it out of your safety deposit box so you need to do something to have physical
[01:57:04.520 --> 01:57:09.200]  ownership but I I like to spread around the world I have clients we store gold in Australia
[01:57:09.200 --> 01:57:13.520]  we store in Switzerland we store in Singapore I believe in diversifying where you have your
[01:57:13.520 --> 01:57:18.000]  gold have some of it you know with yourself but have other the other gold outside the
[01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:23.160]  country right it's not about making money now it's about keeping your money yeah and
[01:57:23.160 --> 01:57:26.640]  if you have to leave the country one day I mean you might not be able to take anything
[01:57:26.640 --> 01:57:31.360]  with you so it's going to be good to have that gold safely offshore so that it'll be
[01:57:31.360 --> 01:57:35.360]  waiting for you when you get wherever it is you're going hey by the way I've got the
[01:57:35.360 --> 01:57:40.280]  website now you're a pack.com I finally bought that so I'm not just you're a pack.net but
[01:57:40.280 --> 01:57:47.160]  I'm your pack.com too. Well fantastic you know I tell you Peter it is an amazing time
[01:57:47.160 --> 01:57:52.640]  to be alive and when all this unravels which it will it's like you said they're going to
[01:57:52.640 --> 01:57:56.880]  say who could have seen it coming and then I've got all those clips of Ron Paul on the
[01:57:56.880 --> 01:58:03.680]  house floor seven eight years before a warning Democrats at 15 years before a warning video
[01:58:03.680 --> 01:58:09.560]  you five six years before a warning on I mean it's just crazy how they play dumb and this
[01:58:09.560 --> 01:58:16.160]  confidence game is just scary. Yeah they never want to acknowledge the critics I remember
[01:58:16.160 --> 01:58:21.600]  you know in the days right after the financial crisis of 2008 when they convened hearings
[01:58:21.600 --> 01:58:26.240]  in Washington to figure out why there was a crisis you know I was begging to be called
[01:58:26.240 --> 01:58:30.680]  as a witness I've since testified twice in Congress on other matters but I wanted to
[01:58:30.680 --> 01:58:35.160]  testify on that committee because I knew why we had a financial crisis but they refused
[01:58:35.160 --> 01:58:40.240]  to let me talk instead all they did is talk to people who blame beauty corporations you're
[01:58:40.240 --> 01:58:44.440]  right and who recommended more government as a solution. Peter Schiff amazing thank
[01:58:44.440 --> 01:58:49.280]  you I'm Alex Jones stay with us.
[01:58:49.280 --> 01:58:53.160]  Ladies and gentlemen you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers and sponsors
[01:58:53.160 --> 01:58:58.280]  on my syndicated radio show or the nightly news or the news website info wars.com because
[01:58:58.280 --> 01:59:03.000]  the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality and they weren't as
[01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:08.280]  affordable as they should be so I refused probably 30 40 firearms manufacturers over
[01:59:08.280 --> 01:59:14.480]  the years will then about six months ago we get contacted by head down firearms HD firearms
[01:59:14.480 --> 01:59:19.440]  dot com own and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs special ops people their veterans their
[01:59:19.440 --> 01:59:23.800]  patriots their listeners of the radio show and they want to support the broadcast it's
[01:59:23.800 --> 01:59:28.440]  always about security whether it's for yourself your wife your loved ones go to their website

[01:59:45.000 --> 02:00:06.640]  at head down firearms HD firearms dot com you're listening to the Alex Jones show big brother
[02:00:06.640 --> 02:00:15.120]  mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[02:00:15.120 --> 02:00:25.760]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones Chikari Jackson reported
[02:00:25.760 --> 02:00:29.440]  from Charleston South Carolina now in a moment we're going to go down to the street it's
[02:00:29.440 --> 02:00:33.040]  going to be more of a tourist type area and we want to find out what people think about
[02:00:33.040 --> 02:00:36.800]  the Confederate flag and also if they think they have any solutions to the violence that
[02:00:36.800 --> 02:00:45.040]  happened here it's it's not about guns it's about what this guy thought and what where
[02:00:45.040 --> 02:00:50.040]  was his thinking coming from because he was clearly felt he was alienated from society
[02:00:50.040 --> 02:00:56.680]  he's not crazy if you look at his blog I mean within the racist logic there's a there's
[02:00:56.680 --> 02:01:02.040]  a logic to what he what he was thinking but it has to do with I'm better than you I'm
[02:01:02.040 --> 02:01:07.720]  superior to you and you are doing things to you know African-Americans are doing things
[02:01:07.720 --> 02:01:12.640]  I mean that isn't ever so you take you're raping our women and taking over the country but
[02:01:12.640 --> 02:01:18.040]  that's on the surface but putting him in jail is not going to deal with it gun laws are
[02:01:18.040 --> 02:01:21.120]  not going to deal with it I mean what if he went in there with a can of gasoline and a
[02:01:21.120 --> 02:01:27.240]  bunch of matches what are we going to do have more strict rules on who gets to have matches
[02:01:27.240 --> 02:01:35.000]  and buys gasoline no we have to deal with the real issues of social inequality social
[02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:40.840]  injustice which is economic in this country and that's what people in a democratic party
[02:01:40.840 --> 02:01:45.280]  don't want to talk about people in a republican party so don't want to talk about the only
[02:01:45.280 --> 02:01:48.440]  person I know that I mean one of the reasons we were coming down we were going to go to
[02:01:48.440 --> 02:01:55.040]  Bernie Sanders rally because I'm supporter of him and this is just in my his personal
[02:01:55.040 --> 02:02:00.800]  guy says nothing to do with what I do professionally you know because he's the only person I think
[02:02:00.800 --> 02:02:13.880]  is who's taking seriously the root causes the systematic involvement of racial injustice
[02:02:13.880 --> 02:02:18.040]  with capitalism in the wealth of this country I mean that's that's really what it comes
[02:02:18.040 --> 02:02:22.800]  down to and nobody wants to talk about it now another hot topic is going on right now
[02:02:22.800 --> 02:02:26.400]  is the one about the Confederate flag you know what is your thoughts of the Confederate
[02:02:26.400 --> 02:02:33.720]  flag should I take it down to stay up what is your thoughts I think they need to at
[02:02:33.720 --> 02:02:43.160]  least move it it belongs in a museum it's it's a very as as Lindsey Graham and I've
[02:02:43.160 --> 02:02:46.960]  talked to Lindsey Graham a couple of times because I'm old biker and I used to lobby
[02:02:46.960 --> 02:02:53.640]  for biker rights when he was in the state senate and I saw him one time in his office
[02:02:53.640 --> 02:03:01.520]  but it it they don't need to fly the battle flag I mean that that and I had I've had southern
[02:03:01.520 --> 02:03:06.720]  friends because I'm not from South Carolina say who had ancestors who fought only with
[02:03:06.720 --> 02:03:13.880]  the Confederacy who said to me we let them steal it but he meant the clan steal that
[02:03:13.880 --> 02:03:18.640]  as a symbol all right well there are the flags you can fly flags of the Confederacy that
[02:03:18.640 --> 02:03:25.080]  don't set off any bells if you're concerned about historical you know the story the heritage
[02:03:25.080 --> 02:03:31.400]  and all that stuff heritage not hate but I mean when you saw that picture of roof the
[02:03:31.400 --> 02:03:36.800]  terrorists it's calling what he really was a terrorist is domestic terrorism that the
[02:03:36.800 --> 02:03:43.280]  government is doing nothing about that he then there's a picture you probably saw in
[02:03:43.280 --> 02:03:50.320]  his blog post he's got a Confederate flag I mean this has just become inextricably identified
[02:03:50.320 --> 02:03:57.320]  with making a racial statement and so if somebody wants to ride on their motorcycle
[02:03:57.320 --> 02:04:00.840]  or do everything and fly the flag in front of their house that's their business but it
[02:04:00.840 --> 02:04:04.680]  shouldn't have any connection with anything associated with the government except in
[02:04:04.680 --> 02:04:09.960]  a museum because then then you've got the context I haven't seen any racial situation
[02:04:09.960 --> 02:04:14.640]  in Charleston I really haven't I'm always suspicious when with these things that happen
[02:04:14.640 --> 02:04:19.640]  I don't know how they occur and why they're occurring the last few years always prompting
[02:04:19.640 --> 02:04:24.360]  the government to do more on so-called our behalf take away more of our liberty smart
[02:04:24.360 --> 02:04:34.280]  lady TSA for instance and DAA Patriot Act yeah I think it's just something it's a precursor
[02:04:34.280 --> 02:04:41.800]  it's a catalyst you know like the 9-11 huge catalyst for everything that's happened so
[02:04:41.800 --> 02:04:46.840]  far and I think I bet that woman's are real liberal I think we're in economic downfall
[02:04:46.840 --> 02:04:55.360]  soon and be prepared for with your full videos up on infowars.com jacarys been filing a lot
[02:04:55.360 --> 02:05:01.080]  of amazing videos with Matt we'll be back to talk to jacarys I was born on the prairies
[02:05:01.080 --> 02:05:06.600]  where the wind blew free and there was nothing to break the light of the sun I was born where
[02:05:06.600 --> 02:05:12.480]  there were no enclosures Geronimo I wonder what he thinks of the permanent checkpoints
[02:05:12.480 --> 02:05:16.960]  where you're quizzed about your citizenship about having to submit to back searches to
[02:05:16.960 --> 02:05:22.400]  ride public transportation his thoughts on nonviolent offenders riding away in prisons
[02:05:22.400 --> 02:05:27.920]  they say that in these current times we are more quotes civilized but are we really more
[02:05:27.920 --> 02:05:34.080]  free when the Persian army demanded King Leonidas and his Spartans surrender their arms the
[02:05:34.080 --> 02:05:39.720]  outnumbered King shouted Molan Labe or come and take them even though Leonidas was eventually
[02:05:39.720 --> 02:05:45.320]  defeated by a much larger adversary he is not remembered for his loss he lives in history
[02:05:45.320 --> 02:05:51.560]  as a beacon of defiance and self-defense the desire to disarm the people is nothing new

[02:08:46.920 --> 02:08:51.560]  just went up on info wars dot com by Kit Daniels Pentagon considers allowing women in every

[02:09:16.120 --> 02:09:22.640]  to do with Obamacare's passage than previously thought and he lied and so did the administration
[02:09:22.640 --> 02:09:33.640]  the administration lied we're gonna go over this and play the clips Gruber in different
[02:09:33.640 --> 02:09:39.520]  videos by Obama and others was thanked as one of the main architects of Obamacare then
[02:09:39.520 --> 02:09:44.800]  Obama said he didn't even know him about to play those clips again of course they got
[02:09:44.800 --> 02:09:50.360]  his emails in Congress and he's there basically heavily involved he's one of the main scammers
[02:09:50.360 --> 02:09:57.480]  he bragged he helped fix the numbers that it would cut your cost of health care when
[02:09:57.480 --> 02:10:03.680]  it increases it he engaged in fraud indict him now no they're gonna have the blackmailed
[02:10:03.680 --> 02:10:09.600]  congress and the blackmailed supreme court just go along with it that's all coming up
[02:10:09.600 --> 02:10:12.960]  jacardi jackson joins us with some really good news I mean I don't know if this is where
[02:10:12.960 --> 02:10:19.000]  he's going but I saw him full wars dot com this morning I saw his videos I saw what he
[02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:24.320]  had been filing there with Matt the camera guy from info wars in Charleston the site
[02:10:24.320 --> 02:10:29.120]  of the tragic events last Wednesday that they had the black lives George Soros group show
[02:10:29.120 --> 02:10:32.920]  up trying to stir stuff up and the locals basically ran him out of town had a meme of
[02:10:32.920 --> 02:10:38.400]  all lives matter very exciting to see people come together I don't think this is making
[02:10:38.400 --> 02:10:43.400]  the establishment very happy and a lot of the locals jacari talked to said we don't buy
[02:10:43.400 --> 02:10:48.520]  the story we've been given Reverend Childress says it doesn't all add up I mean you look
[02:10:48.520 --> 02:10:53.840]  at those photos of him with the rebel flag and the guns I mean it looks like something
[02:10:53.840 --> 02:10:59.080]  out of a movie and the perfect timing and Juneteenth and we know they ship guns into
[02:10:59.080 --> 02:11:02.960]  Mexico to blame the second amendment we know they shipped in people to engage in violence
[02:11:02.960 --> 02:11:10.440]  in other areas I mean this is social engineering anyway you slice it but joining us as jacari
[02:11:10.440 --> 02:11:14.680]  Jackson he'll be coming back today I'm really glad he doesn't have to stay because he'd
[02:11:14.680 --> 02:11:21.160]  have to stay if stuff broke out some folks to face some statues and I totally understand
[02:11:21.160 --> 02:11:25.760]  that you know if it's seen as because here he is with the rebel flag saying the rebel
[02:11:25.760 --> 02:11:30.600]  flag means kill Christian black people for no reason but that's all branding you could
[02:11:30.600 --> 02:11:37.560]  have somebody kill folks with the American flag does that then demonize it it's it's
[02:11:37.560 --> 02:11:41.920]  it shows the mind control jacari Jackson you were there last night during all of this what
[02:11:41.920 --> 02:11:46.680]  did you witness well last night Alex we're here in Charleston South Carolina we're on
[02:11:46.680 --> 02:11:51.920]  the bridge right behind me that is the rabbinale bridge over the Cooper River and it goes from
[02:11:51.920 --> 02:11:55.360]  Charleston over to the next city once you cross over the bridge you're in the next city
[02:11:55.360 --> 02:12:00.480]  and what we saw was a conservative 10,000 people out there police estimates put it up
[02:12:00.480 --> 02:12:06.720]  to maybe 15,000 other people say 20,000 but conservative 10,000 nonetheless people join
[02:12:06.720 --> 02:12:11.120]  hand to hand there across this bridge now this bridge behind me is one of the largest
[02:12:11.120 --> 02:12:15.640]  in the region and I think it's the third largest in the western hemisphere it spans two and
[02:12:15.640 --> 02:12:20.680]  a half miles so it took us about 30 minutes just to walk to I guess halfway point on the
[02:12:20.680 --> 02:12:24.360]  bridge and that's when the people from the other town Mount Pleasant came and met us
[02:12:24.360 --> 02:12:29.760]  and they joined across the bridge and a great showing of unity respect love and faith so
[02:12:29.760 --> 02:12:34.400]  it was a very impressive moment I'm still waiting to see the hard numbers for about
[02:12:34.400 --> 02:12:38.400]  how many people came out but it was thousands and thousands of people no incidents that
[02:12:38.400 --> 02:12:42.800]  I'm aware of they had a police escort had fire trucks blocking the street so everybody
[02:12:42.800 --> 02:12:46.640]  could get out there calmly peacefully and that's what the focus was last night here
[02:12:46.640 --> 02:12:52.760]  in Charleston that bridge looks space age now it's a very impressive bridge when I first
[02:12:52.760 --> 02:12:55.840]  heard that these guys were going to march on this bridge and go hand to hand I was like
[02:12:55.840 --> 02:12:59.720]  wow that's a really really long bridge but people came out by the thousands while we
[02:12:59.720 --> 02:13:04.000]  were first getting there and filing our initial reports you know buses would come and drop
[02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:07.960]  people off you know and people would drive up hop out of cars and go park the car and
[02:13:07.960 --> 02:13:11.720]  everybody ran out on the bridge and it was a really good thing to see you know very positive
[02:13:11.720 --> 02:13:16.080]  a lot of people were driving by honking their horns or people who had boats also police
[02:13:16.080 --> 02:13:19.800]  boats and water people driving by taking pictures people in the boats taking pictures
[02:13:19.800 --> 02:13:23.920]  so it's a really good moment and a very positive thing that's going on here in Charleston now
[02:13:23.920 --> 02:13:28.200]  as we saw today the crowd is starting to diminish a little bit outside the church we drove by
[02:13:28.200 --> 02:13:32.280]  there earlier in the previous days you'd have hundreds of people out there now there's you
[02:13:32.280 --> 02:13:36.880]  know maybe 50 or 50 or so people out there and we drove by just a little bit ago so you
[02:13:36.880 --> 02:13:40.600]  know people are kind of returning to their normal lives but people have definitely not
[02:13:40.600 --> 02:13:44.880]  forgotten you know they showed dropping off flowers and saying their prayers out there
[02:13:44.880 --> 02:13:49.680]  so it's always in people's minds but they're returning more to their normal sure the funerals
[02:13:49.680 --> 02:13:54.720]  are going to start this weekend and that's going to open up the ones again but so far
[02:13:54.720 --> 02:13:59.120]  it looks like people aren't listening to Al Sharpton and others and thank God there weren't
[02:13:59.120 --> 02:14:05.160]  any more copycat white supremacist attacks oh yes I saw some of those articles you were
[02:14:05.160 --> 02:14:08.400]  referencing talking about they didn't want anybody to come out here and race bait and
[02:14:08.400 --> 02:14:12.400]  try to cook things up and you know the hashtag is going on you know stay away so and so stay
[02:14:12.400 --> 02:14:16.560]  away and as far as I know you know we didn't have any real agitators out here you know
[02:14:16.560 --> 02:14:22.360]  of course we had some defacing of the confederate statues going on in the I guess it was last
[02:14:22.360 --> 02:14:26.640]  night and we drove by there a little bit earlier and saw guys powerwashing them off but we
[02:14:26.640 --> 02:14:29.640]  didn't really see any remnants of it so they got off the boat.
[02:14:29.640 --> 02:14:33.200]  What do you expect people to do when this guy because so many folks want to defend the
[02:14:33.200 --> 02:14:37.640]  rebel flag they're saying you know hey it wasn't involved in this well the guy went
[02:14:37.640 --> 02:14:43.360]  and killed people draped in it so you need to decry him so that's clear because I mean
[02:14:43.360 --> 02:14:48.520]  what do you expect people to do I think that is very light blowing off of steam to deface
[02:14:48.520 --> 02:14:49.520]  some of the statues.
[02:14:49.520 --> 02:14:54.520]  Oh yeah I definitely agree with that I just have that one area and I thought it was very
[02:14:54.520 --> 02:14:58.200]  interesting because we saw some of the people this past weekend said they were going to
[02:14:58.200 --> 02:15:01.880]  go to the Calhoun statue but they went to a different statue that was in a different
[02:15:01.880 --> 02:15:04.360]  part of town and defaced that.
[02:15:04.360 --> 02:15:07.960]  All right well Jakari Jackson I guess you're getting back on a plane thanks for working
[02:15:07.960 --> 02:15:12.320]  so hard I mean all of our team I can't say who's the best you're also wonderful but great
[02:15:12.320 --> 02:15:16.360]  job again and great job of the camera crew Matt's one of our newest additions to the
[02:15:16.360 --> 02:15:19.760]  office he's been doing a great job I'd say his last name I didn't ask him if he wants
[02:15:19.760 --> 02:15:24.200]  to be known on air by his last name but Matt great job as well.
[02:15:24.200 --> 02:15:25.440]  He says thank you.
[02:15:25.440 --> 02:15:27.920]  All right all right anything else Jakari?
[02:15:27.920 --> 02:15:33.440]  No just been a good time and you know anybody who has seen some of the more recent reports
[02:15:33.440 --> 02:15:36.240]  I've done over the past year you know where there's Ferguson some of these other cities
[02:15:36.240 --> 02:15:40.760]  you know this is a complete 180 from that and I definitely hope it's a 180 for the country
[02:15:40.760 --> 02:15:42.200]  as we move forward.
[02:15:42.200 --> 02:15:46.440]  That was a really good people of Ferguson speak out I forget the exact name we aired
[02:15:46.440 --> 02:15:51.200]  some of it earlier that was a really good report folks are pretty informed on there.
[02:15:51.200 --> 02:15:55.240]  Oh yeah people are definitely getting educated about what's going on you know people are
[02:15:55.240 --> 02:15:59.040]  interested in finding out what else is going on behind the scenes not just these surface
[02:15:59.040 --> 02:16:02.880]  things but what's actually the root cause of some of these incidents we've seen around
[02:16:02.880 --> 02:16:03.880]  the country.
[02:16:03.880 --> 02:16:07.760]  All right Jakari Jackson M4's Natalie News anchor thank you so much.
[02:16:07.760 --> 02:16:08.760]  Thank you.
[02:16:08.760 --> 02:16:12.760]  And folks we intend to hire a couple more reporters and a couple more writers and a couple more
[02:16:12.760 --> 02:16:17.040]  camera people we're pretty much going to be as big as I want to get info wars but right
[02:16:17.040 --> 02:16:20.880]  now we're kind of strapped because we're always sending reporters around and then all of our
[02:16:20.880 --> 02:16:24.920]  reporters do other behind the scenes stuff whether it's camera editing and Jakari's
[02:16:24.920 --> 02:16:28.080]  done so many of the great intros you see so much of the great video editing and audio
[02:16:28.080 --> 02:16:32.560]  editing he is a real treasure I'm so glad we were able to find Jakari Jackson and then
[02:16:32.560 --> 02:16:36.760]  David Knight and Leigh Ann McAdoo and everybody else I mean just what an amazing group of
[02:16:36.760 --> 02:16:44.960]  people I want to do a whole hour on the rebel flag the stars and bars.
[02:16:44.960 --> 02:16:49.960]  Number one it's a very handsome flag it's a really good looking flag if you go to infowars.com
[02:16:49.960 --> 02:16:55.920]  you can see the flag I think a good shot of it as one of the I know everybody's seen
[02:16:55.920 --> 02:17:02.680]  it but it's a really cool wrinkled shot of it to talk about the rebel flag would take
[02:17:02.680 --> 02:17:09.040]  an hour to properly hit every angle at one level I don't like it other levels I do like
[02:17:09.040 --> 02:17:13.520]  it and I know why people do want to keep it and so I'm going to spend a few minutes
[02:17:13.520 --> 02:17:18.240]  telling you why and we're going to come back to CJ who helps produce the show he had some
[02:17:18.240 --> 02:17:22.880]  historically accurate points during the break last break so I'm going to bring him on in
[02:17:22.880 --> 02:17:26.600]  the next segment then I'm going to come back cover world news that we haven't gotten to
[02:17:26.600 --> 02:17:32.320]  yet and some of our top stories here's the issue I'm from Texas Texas was part of this
[02:17:32.320 --> 02:17:37.720]  whole southern movement it was not about slavery I've read the documents the papers the real
[02:17:37.720 --> 02:17:43.080]  history of the time it was about who would enjoy western expansion the north that was
[02:17:43.080 --> 02:17:50.440]  mainly industrial had very high tariffs on the southern cotton other things leaving the
[02:17:50.440 --> 02:17:55.480]  country internal tariffs on them trying to sell their goods whenever we had a southern
[02:17:55.480 --> 02:18:02.480]  president Andrew Jackson the south tried to rebel against him and almost had a civil
[02:18:02.480 --> 02:18:09.920]  war over taxes so so so even Jackson was letting the north screw the south 2% of the south
[02:18:09.920 --> 02:18:16.000]  had slaves most of the whites that were poor were as bad off as the black slaves I mean
[02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:20.240]  that's historical they were called sharecroppers they were slaves for all intents and purposes
[02:18:20.240 --> 02:18:24.480]  their ancestors got here to pay for the way over they would sign up for seven to ten
[02:18:24.480 --> 02:18:29.400]  years indentured servitude I'm gonna skip this network breaks we have more time they
[02:18:29.400 --> 02:18:34.240]  would they would get over here and so they were slaves to it doesn't take from the plight
[02:18:34.240 --> 02:18:38.400]  of the Africans who were definitely treated the worst on their way over here and who were
[02:18:38.400 --> 02:18:43.960]  treated the worst when it came to their rights when it came to starvation poverty degradation
[02:18:43.960 --> 02:18:49.640]  the sharecroppers were pretty close to the bottom of the barrel as well and so Robert
[02:18:49.640 --> 02:18:57.680]  Lee was the commandant of West Point he was a famous general in the US military he didn't
[02:18:57.680 --> 02:19:04.920]  support slavery he didn't support the south but he supported states rights and so he resigned
[02:19:04.920 --> 02:19:09.240]  his commission and joined being a general within a year or so became the head of the
[02:19:09.240 --> 02:19:15.200]  southern forces it's very interesting history I've read all about it I don't dress up in
[02:19:15.200 --> 02:19:21.680]  gray uniforms at home I don't dress up in blue uniforms at home quite frankly I have
[02:19:21.680 --> 02:19:26.520]  an illustrious lineage in US history from Texas right back to the founding of the country
[02:19:26.520 --> 02:19:31.720]  and before so obviously I'm not going to get into my southern civil war roots just puts
[02:19:31.720 --> 02:19:35.840]  you this way the rednecks and people they know about it bow down to me okay but the
[02:19:35.840 --> 02:19:44.720]  whole point is that that I understand that the south was snookered the south was bamboozled
[02:19:44.720 --> 02:19:51.880]  the south was set up and the north was a victim in this thing as well but 600 plus thousand
[02:19:51.880 --> 02:19:58.360]  soldiers died the civil war now did the south fight 3 to 1 4 to 1 10 to 1 by the end with
[02:19:58.360 --> 02:20:02.800]  about 10 times the military equipment on the north did the south win the first two three
[02:20:02.800 --> 02:20:07.200]  years against the north with some of the best military maneuvers with Stonewall Jackson
[02:20:07.200 --> 02:20:14.800]  and others yes so there's the pride of the south that they absolutely dominated the north
[02:20:14.800 --> 02:20:19.920]  when on average they were fighting 4 to 1 against northern soldiers but these were city guys
[02:20:19.920 --> 02:20:25.640]  from the north they weren't the children of the you know the wagon train folks so you talk
[02:20:25.640 --> 02:20:30.360]  about skin about run a trot line the north was fighting Davy Crockett so that's why
[02:20:30.360 --> 02:20:33.920]  they were in deep trouble the south ran out of shoes ran out of guns ran out of bullets
[02:20:33.920 --> 02:20:40.440]  so there's this illustrious strength of the south and and and the whole giant black brigades
[02:20:40.440 --> 02:20:47.960]  that fought on the side of the south the whole nine yards the history you're given is not
[02:20:47.960 --> 02:20:52.000]  the real history that was going on slavery was a horrible institution that the west
[02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:57.200]  began the process of getting rid of there were annals in Alabama where a lot of Texans
[02:20:57.200 --> 02:21:02.200]  came here because they would try to arm their slaves basically free them and then set up
[02:21:02.200 --> 02:21:12.320]  basically their own industrial agrarian combines that was going on a lot of people in the south
[02:21:12.320 --> 02:21:16.720]  got kicked out to Texas because they were doing what George Washington and Thomas Jefferson
[02:21:16.720 --> 02:21:24.280]  had done upon their deaths freeing their agrarian slaves so so it's a 2% had slaves of those
[02:21:24.280 --> 02:21:28.640]  that did there was a percentage that beat people and killed them and everything else
[02:21:28.640 --> 02:21:34.680]  with most other folks it was a entirely different culture than what the media projects no one's
[02:21:34.680 --> 02:21:41.120]  defending it's just that what you're told in the news and in the media is not what's
[02:21:41.120 --> 02:21:51.960]  going on it has no reflection in reality to what happened then the biggest issue is that
[02:21:51.960 --> 02:21:57.160]  for the decade after the civil war Lincoln didn't want to break down the south he didn't
[02:21:57.160 --> 02:22:02.960]  want to follow a Sherman's model of reconstruction he got shot in the back of the head by John
[02:22:02.960 --> 02:22:07.840]  Wilkes Booth were told really the evidence points towards that being a setup that a lot
[02:22:07.840 --> 02:22:11.600]  of folks wanted to loot the south a lot of northern industrialists wanted to take it
[02:22:11.600 --> 02:22:16.920]  over the railroads wanted to dominate it again I don't know how the south got set up British
[02:22:16.920 --> 02:22:21.960]  intelligence on record armed and trained a bunch of the south gave them weapons and then
[02:22:21.960 --> 02:22:27.240]  when they had the boa constrictor or was the Ataconda strategy it was the big giant snake
[02:22:27.240 --> 02:22:32.320]  all the way around the east coast all the way at the Mississippi to to to basically
[02:22:32.320 --> 02:22:37.680]  cut off supplies the British didn't break those and didn't supply the south I'm not
[02:22:37.680 --> 02:22:41.920]  demonizing the British either these are just facts of what happened that you watch shows
[02:22:41.920 --> 02:22:46.800]  like roots or other shows they don't teach this they show a guy with a whip beat the
[02:22:46.800 --> 02:22:53.520]  black guy and that's just not what it was slavery was already being phased out it was
[02:22:53.520 --> 02:23:00.120]  collapsing because of industrialization and Eli Whitney's cotton gin which was probably
[02:23:00.120 --> 02:23:04.640]  actually invented by a black guy but the point is that no kidding wanted to quit having
[02:23:04.640 --> 02:23:10.280]  to pull the stuff out of the cotton themselves so the reality is not what the public's been
[02:23:10.280 --> 02:23:17.640]  given and reconstruction reconstruction was absolutely hellish my family owned a hotel
[02:23:17.640 --> 02:23:23.640]  on my dad's side in east Texas and when the northern soldiers came in after the civil
[02:23:23.640 --> 02:23:28.360]  war they didn't just take it over they just burn it to the ground and killed everybody
[02:23:28.360 --> 02:23:34.640]  and it's on tombstones the family cemetery killed during killed in reconstruction killed
[02:23:34.640 --> 02:23:40.760]  in reconstruction killed in reconstruction so it was a hellish occupation for a decade
[02:23:40.760 --> 02:23:44.920]  and why didn't they go back to their old state flags as CJ said during the break the
[02:23:44.920 --> 02:23:49.800]  only way to spit in the eye of the north was to make the rebel flag the state flags and
[02:23:49.800 --> 02:23:57.440]  defy that someday will beat you someday will get free and in a way the south has had its
[02:23:57.440 --> 02:24:02.040]  sick revenge and that the north has become so corrupt and taken over by mafia and government
[02:24:02.040 --> 02:24:06.840]  and the south has lower taxes that all the industry and people are moving to the south
[02:24:06.840 --> 02:24:11.680]  I don't have some hate the northerner strategy you know I have strong roots to New York on
[02:24:11.680 --> 02:24:15.840]  my mother's side of the family and the heirs family that helped found the state of Texas
[02:24:15.840 --> 02:24:19.840]  and you know raised Colonel Travis's son in the whole nine yards David Ayres William
[02:24:19.840 --> 02:24:25.920]  Ayres you name it they were successful business owners landowners in New York City in fact
[02:24:25.920 --> 02:24:31.320]  one of them own the land the UN's on today sold it ended up being the Rockefeller hands
[02:24:31.320 --> 02:24:35.600]  and that was owned by my family and they sold everything they had to move to Texas it was
[02:24:35.600 --> 02:24:41.240]  a Protestant revolution against Catholics and they came here with boatloads of Bibles
[02:24:41.240 --> 02:24:46.680]  and that basically was what ignited the revolution in Texas and they were there at Washington
[02:24:46.680 --> 02:24:51.640]  the Brazos helping put all that into place so and I'm not bashing Catholics either I'm
[02:24:51.640 --> 02:24:55.200]  just giving you the background this politically correct world we're not supposed to talk about
[02:24:55.200 --> 02:25:02.800]  history or names or what happened or what went on and we look at the rebel flag today
[02:25:02.800 --> 02:25:06.480]  and people think oh it's about going out and killing folks or it's about slavery when this
[02:25:06.480 --> 02:25:12.120]  scumbag whether he was behind it or not the Ark type of this guy's a scumbag this this
[02:25:12.120 --> 02:25:18.360]  roof this punk those and kills nine innocent people in their church for no reason but to
[02:25:18.360 --> 02:25:25.520]  cause a race war we shouldn't give him what he wants to pull down civil war statues we're
[02:25:25.520 --> 02:25:29.840]  going to pull them down in the north they're just historical the Pharaohs had slaves we're
[02:25:29.840 --> 02:25:37.680]  going to go to Egypt and blow up you know images of Toucan common no I mean it's stupid
[02:25:37.680 --> 02:25:42.760]  it we're going to blow up statues of Julius Caesar because he had slaves that's what this
[02:25:42.760 --> 02:25:48.760]  is all about but the media has branded it as hate so the right winger extremist and
[02:25:48.760 --> 02:25:53.160]  the left wing extremist believe it now it's it's really a case of brainwashing how they've
[02:25:53.160 --> 02:25:59.360]  taken a symbol I mean Robert E. Lee was probably one of the most popular people in America I
[02:25:59.360 --> 02:26:03.720]  was even reading this in like Time Life magazine that they have a civil war issue they admitted
[02:26:03.720 --> 02:26:07.240]  it in there I'd read that but I was surprised they admitted he was one of the most popular
[02:26:07.240 --> 02:26:11.960]  men in America when he died seen as his honorable and as an incredible a general as you could
[02:26:11.960 --> 02:26:17.920]  be by the north it wasn't about slavery Lincoln wrote letter after letter saying if I could
[02:26:17.920 --> 02:26:23.240]  end this not free one slave I would so that's another fraud and it'd be great if we fought
[02:26:23.240 --> 02:26:30.360]  a civil war to end slavery that sounds great doesn't it it isn't true so that's the issue
[02:26:30.360 --> 02:26:36.240]  the robber barons set America up with British intelligence in a pincer attack to break the
[02:26:36.240 --> 02:26:41.280]  whole country up the civil war was an attack on the north and the south by the robber barons
[02:26:41.280 --> 02:26:46.760]  financed by British intelligence period so all the southerners are wrong all the northerners
[02:26:46.760 --> 02:26:52.440]  are wrong histories right and we're idiots to be played okay we got four minutes to break
[02:26:52.440 --> 02:26:56.640]  I want to get a CJ's take you can repeat what you said earlier about the situation your
[02:26:56.640 --> 02:27:01.760]  view on the rebel flag well you essentially stole my thunder about what happened in the
[02:27:01.760 --> 02:27:11.680]  south after the restoration or the reconstruction but it goes along with the same thing that
[02:27:11.680 --> 02:27:17.640]  every society has done Hitler took the swastika that was an Indian symbol of brotherhood turned
[02:27:17.640 --> 02:27:23.120]  it into a symbol of hate it'll be a symbol of hate till the end of time or we forget
[02:27:23.120 --> 02:27:31.080]  about it as a society in parts of Africa the British flag meant death was coming because
[02:27:31.080 --> 02:27:38.280]  the British were tyrannical on every scale in that continent and it's too bad people
[02:27:38.280 --> 02:27:43.280]  that believe it's heritage are gonna have to get over it because a couple of bad eggs
[02:27:43.280 --> 02:27:48.000]  or hundreds of bad eggs well sure I mean if we get rid of the rebel flag what's next
[02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:52.360]  and well I mean it's another saying the word dad is hurtful now you can't have father's
[02:27:52.360 --> 02:27:57.120]  day now they've got ads for the SC you know for the animals you know saying don't be
[02:27:57.120 --> 02:28:04.400]  a deadbeat dad's neuter your dog or spade it's hilarious but you have schools here that
[02:28:04.400 --> 02:28:09.880]  say you can't wear an American flag because it's hateful what's next and you can attribute
[02:28:09.880 --> 02:28:13.680]  things that are bad to it and I'm sure we can find some crazy person to go kill people
[02:28:13.680 --> 02:28:21.560]  draped in it yeah well you just hit on it that's a headline what's next ban the American
[02:28:21.560 --> 02:28:28.520]  flag I mean the American flag is flown over more slaves than the Confederate flag Palestinians
[02:28:28.520 --> 02:28:34.880]  would think the Israeli flag is a vicious symbol of hate and we're not saying that we're
[02:28:34.880 --> 02:28:42.800]  saying from that perspective yeah I mean there is exactly CJ so how far does this go and
[02:28:42.800 --> 02:28:48.120]  so political correctness takes a backseat to reason until we realize it's the true threat
[02:28:48.120 --> 02:28:52.960]  to all of our freedom yeah the rebel flag is not a threat the American flag is not a
[02:28:52.960 --> 02:29:03.320]  threat president Obama said that just because the n words not used in society doesn't mean
[02:29:03.320 --> 02:29:08.520]  that we don't have deep seated racism but it's just a word it's just a flag it's just
[02:29:08.520 --> 02:29:14.440]  a symbol it's the well the truth is losers want to engage in racism be they black or
[02:29:14.440 --> 02:29:17.680]  white we know there's plenty of races that are black Hispanic I mean just humans do that
[02:29:17.680 --> 02:29:22.360]  it's tribalism losers get into that because they're not successful themselves and need
[02:29:22.360 --> 02:29:27.400]  to feel better by putting somebody down and the truth is the Democratic Party shamelessly
[02:29:27.400 --> 02:29:32.840]  keeps racism alive they're the biggest filthy pimps of it and I'm sick of them I'm sick
[02:29:32.840 --> 02:29:38.120]  of being gained by the Klan and all their house slaves like Obama that's it Obama is
[02:29:38.120 --> 02:29:42.560]  a black man sent to convince black people to abort their babies he's the biggest grand
[02:29:42.560 --> 02:29:48.680]  dragon the world's ever seen and I mean it when I say he wants to murder black people
[02:29:48.680 --> 02:29:59.560]  we're on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network let's
[02:29:59.560 --> 02:30:06.640]  talk about the real war on women first wave feminism was a noble cause but modern feminists
[02:30:06.640 --> 02:30:12.640]  well instead of fighting for say paid and protected maternity leave they want to ban
[02:30:12.640 --> 02:30:19.760]  words shirts and man spreading come on that's cultural Marxism which asserts that culture
[02:30:19.760 --> 02:30:25.680]  and language is responsible for oppressing women and not the state the truth is the state
[02:30:25.680 --> 02:30:30.960]  encourages gender wars it's a divide and conquer tactic designed to keep us fighting amongst
[02:30:30.960 --> 02:30:36.600]  ourselves in fact the feminist movement was hijacked by the political class to exploit
[02:30:36.600 --> 02:30:42.080]  women as the late Aaron Russo revealed the Rockefellers bankrolled feminism and not because
[02:30:42.080 --> 02:30:47.280]  they had any interest in women's rights but because women in the workforce was the ultimate
[02:30:47.280 --> 02:30:52.840]  trifecta the state collects more tax dollars children are indoctrinated at an earlier age

[02:33:34.440 --> 02:33:37.440]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:33:39.440 --> 02:33:43.440]  Last night in Little Rock, put me in a haze.
[02:33:43.440 --> 02:33:51.440]  Sweet, sweet Connie was doing her acts. She had the whole show and that's a natural fact.
[02:33:52.440 --> 02:33:59.440]  Live all night, we can't keep. I got to tell you, all you need is pain.
[02:33:59.440 --> 02:34:06.440]  These ladies keep me right, and don't even think you make it to the show.
[02:34:06.440 --> 02:34:13.440]  We're an American man. You stop worrying about the North, South, East, West, and get back to the Americana.
[02:34:13.440 --> 02:34:27.440]  Free market, private property, strong families, Second Amendment, right to the fence, low taxes, and stop having them divide us.
[02:34:27.440 --> 02:34:37.440]  All right, I have got a ton of news to get to in a short time to get there. I want to get into Gruber first and then everything else.
[02:34:37.440 --> 02:34:54.440]  First off, let me just throw this out there. Thank you so much for buying the high quality water filtration systems, the books, the videos, the non-GMO, heirloom, seeds, the lowest prices, the Patriot apparel to spread the word, the super high quality, non-GMO, high quality,
[02:34:54.440 --> 02:34:59.440]  nutraceuticals. Your purchases make everything we do possible.
[02:35:01.440 --> 02:35:06.440]  And yes, if we sell high quality products that really give you a good response, you're going to want to buy them again.
[02:35:06.440 --> 02:35:12.440]  So just if I was cold-blooded, I want to sell you really good stuff because I want you to keep coming back.
[02:35:14.440 --> 02:35:22.440]  But I never was, that's sophisticated back when I was younger. I always just tried to do a good job because that's how I want to be treated.
[02:35:22.440 --> 02:35:27.440]  But thank you for loving infowarslife.com products.
[02:35:27.440 --> 02:35:40.440]  Whether it's the survival shield, nasa99x2, or colloidal silver, or the super male vitality, super female vitality, the secret 12, the winter sun.
[02:35:40.440 --> 02:35:46.440]  All of it is the purest, strongest, most hardcore stuff that we know people are the most lacking in.
[02:35:46.440 --> 02:35:52.440]  Amigo takes synthetic vitamins, they don't do anything but fill up your gallbladder and fry your kidneys.
[02:35:52.440 --> 02:35:55.440]  You take the real stuff.
[02:35:55.440 --> 02:36:01.440]  I mean, here's an example. One product, DNA force, costs us over $50 a bottle to produce.
[02:36:03.440 --> 02:36:08.440]  Similar formulas that have $50 a product in themself are $300.
[02:36:08.440 --> 02:36:15.440]  It's our most expensive product at $129. I mean, it's marked up one and a half times.
[02:36:15.440 --> 02:36:20.440]  Why can't these companies fund themselves without marking it up seven times?
[02:36:20.440 --> 02:36:33.440]  The point is, you want Bio, CoQ10, all the stuff in there, off the chart, organic, totally absorbable, the Rolls Royce of everything for your entire body, your cells, DNA force.
[02:36:33.440 --> 02:36:39.440]  Write down the products that are $14.95.
[02:36:39.440 --> 02:36:45.440]  So we've got the highest quality products at the lowest prices out there.
[02:36:45.440 --> 02:36:52.440]  Occupower, say it's for your eyes because it really helps them, it's the poor man's DNA force.
[02:36:52.440 --> 02:36:56.440]  It's got stuff in it, almost as good for $24.
[02:36:58.440 --> 02:37:00.440]  And it's simply amazing.
[02:37:00.440 --> 02:37:15.440]  But regardless, when you purchase these products, you're funding an operation dedicated to not dumbing people down, dedicated to giving people a wider context and bringing us together through our shared experiences, every race, color, or creed.
[02:37:15.440 --> 02:37:23.440]  And when I called Obama the greatest grand dragon ever lived, think about it, he could double black unemployment.
[02:37:23.440 --> 02:37:30.440]  He could increase worldwide abortions of black people. For Africa, you name it, and be called a lover of black people.
[02:37:30.440 --> 02:37:35.440]  I mean, if I'd killed 14 million black people, like Roe v. Wade has, would I be praised?
[02:37:35.440 --> 02:37:39.440]  It's just sick. I'm being called a racist because I'm against Obamacare.
[02:37:39.440 --> 02:37:49.440]  It's a giant screw job when Obama is a eugenicist frontman for people that want to kill everybody.
[02:37:49.440 --> 02:37:56.440]  They've had black people under their thumb more so they can get away with it more on them. We're all in this together.
[02:37:56.440 --> 02:37:59.440]  We're not going to make it if we don't wake up.
[02:37:59.440 --> 02:38:01.440]  Sorry, I'm digressing.
[02:38:01.440 --> 02:38:07.440]  I read last hour, I've asked the crew to bring me just print off three reviews every day.
[02:38:07.440 --> 02:38:14.440]  There's scores of new ones, there's, I don't know how many reviews, close to a thousand just on survival shield makes an iodine X2.
[02:38:14.440 --> 02:38:21.440]  This is for Big Mac, Salt Lake City, Utah. I don't want to write a link, and this is on a third party major review site.
[02:38:21.440 --> 02:38:27.440]  You can click it and see it all right there. I don't want to write a lengthy review, but I will say this product is bleeping hardcore.
[02:38:27.440 --> 02:38:34.440]  I lived every day and the stuff is boosting me to maximum energy. You have to try it, not just listen to reviews, it's awesome.
[02:38:34.440 --> 02:38:40.440]  I would recommend this to a friend. There's thousands of these. We've got them for every product.
[02:38:40.440 --> 02:38:48.440]  This product is everything they said it was. Warning, if you have high libido, you might want to think twice for trying it.
[02:38:48.440 --> 02:38:52.440]  It's that powerful.
[02:38:52.440 --> 02:38:57.440]  Too expensive for me to take regularly. It's not that expensive, man.
[02:38:57.440 --> 02:39:04.440]  What little money I have goes to the M4 Store Proxel. Thank you so much, gaming underscore org.
[02:39:04.440 --> 02:39:11.440]  I mean, it costs us a lot to drill and get this stuff. And comparatively, if folks can't afford it, get high quality MLA,
[02:39:11.440 --> 02:39:16.440]  and our other salts are known to have iodine in it, you'll get some of the effect.
[02:39:16.440 --> 02:39:20.440]  It's just bound, so you won't absorb it all. You just got to take more.
[02:39:20.440 --> 02:39:26.440]  Talk to your physician, but yeah, it's been five, ten bucks on salt. Remember to take it or take this every day.
[02:39:26.440 --> 02:39:32.440]  It's just different because ours is a deep earth source that's pure crystals.
[02:39:32.440 --> 02:39:37.440]  We're trying to come up with a pill that's least expensive.
[02:39:37.440 --> 02:39:42.440]  And for some reason, it's just held to manufacture this stuff. It's held to get it.
[02:39:42.440 --> 02:39:51.440]  Because when something is 9999, it's a precursor, key element to so much.
[02:39:51.440 --> 02:39:54.440]  It's what they use to make a bunch of illegal drugs.
[02:39:54.440 --> 02:39:59.440]  And we've had to be checked out by the DEA, you name it, everything just to be able to manufacture this.
[02:39:59.440 --> 02:40:03.440]  It's clear we're not drug dealers. We're just selling the iodine that's legal and lawful.
[02:40:03.440 --> 02:40:08.440]  And you can't take the product we sell and do anything with it because it's been mixed into the palm oil and everything.
[02:40:08.440 --> 02:40:13.440]  It's the pure gas form that's so controlled. I mean, it's a controlled substance.
[02:40:13.440 --> 02:40:16.440]  They control the precursors that go into any of this industrial stuff.
[02:40:16.440 --> 02:40:20.440]  I mean, just put it this way. Where, where does to come out with something like this?
[02:40:20.440 --> 02:40:25.440]  I mean, nobody's got this because, well, we had industrial sabotage folks jacking with us,
[02:40:25.440 --> 02:40:31.440]  trying to keep us from able to fund ourselves, going around our suppliers of the purest kelp sources.
[02:40:31.440 --> 02:40:39.440]  And as a blessing, we kept researching and found a couple of years ago a deep earth source that was supplying major industry,
[02:40:39.440 --> 02:40:46.440]  but they only get limited amounts of it. And we're such a small buyer that it's hard for us to even get in and be able to get it.
[02:40:46.440 --> 02:40:51.440]  But that's the blessing and a curse at the same time because we had this limited run.
[02:40:51.440 --> 02:40:55.440]  We're trying to secure more right now. I hope this isn't the end of survival shield.
[02:40:55.440 --> 02:40:56.440]  Nice and I.
[02:40:56.440 --> 02:41:00.440]  But Lord always comes through for us. So whatever happens, happens.
[02:41:00.440 --> 02:41:07.440]  I have confidence in that in full wars life.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:41:07.440 --> 02:41:12.440]  And we have the liver cleanse. You can do the standard liver cleanse taking it every day.
[02:41:12.440 --> 02:41:14.440]  And it just helps or do the intense one.
[02:41:14.440 --> 02:41:19.440]  We take the oxy powder, drink the apple cider vinegar four times a day and take olive oil six days later
[02:41:19.440 --> 02:41:25.440]  and lay on your right side for an hour before we go to bed and get ready to be totally freaked out
[02:41:25.440 --> 02:41:30.440]  when the average person 20, 30 black or green balls come out of your gallbladder.
[02:41:30.440 --> 02:41:34.440]  You get too many of your gallbladder burst. You're not supposed to have them in there.
[02:41:34.440 --> 02:41:39.440]  That's how much artificial crap and melamine and fluoride and toxins are in our body
[02:41:39.440 --> 02:41:42.440]  and the body just fights to survive and takes that out.
[02:41:42.440 --> 02:41:44.440]  That's what your liver is going through.
[02:41:44.440 --> 02:41:49.440]  And by the way, I'm just, it's total transparency here. I do drink some.
[02:41:49.440 --> 02:41:54.440]  I've gone three years without drinking, but it's like smoking. I go smoke one or two cigars.
[02:41:54.440 --> 02:41:57.440]  I get right back on them. I go out, smoke cigars and I want a beer.
[02:41:57.440 --> 02:42:01.440]  I drink a beer then I want a martini.
[02:42:01.440 --> 02:42:08.440]  And I started my cleanse last week, wasn't drinking, drank one drink.
[02:42:08.440 --> 02:42:11.440]  And normally, I mean, I could drink a bunch of drinks and I got, whoa, it hit me really hard.
[02:42:11.440 --> 02:42:16.440]  And I've been told that by Dr. Rip and others, do not drink if you're doing the advanced cleanse.
[02:42:16.440 --> 02:42:26.440]  I mean, it will hurt your liver. That is, don't drink while you're doing the cleanse because it opens your liver wide open, wide open.
[02:42:26.440 --> 02:42:30.440]  That's the joke around here. Weldon does the cleanse every few months because he's a musician and plays a lot,
[02:42:30.440 --> 02:42:33.440]  has a few lone stars when he's playing.
[02:42:33.440 --> 02:42:36.440]  And he said, I love how much money it saves me buying beer.
[02:42:36.440 --> 02:42:41.440]  I could drink a 12 pack and not get a buzz and had to do a liver cleanse for about a month, two beers and he's done.
[02:42:41.440 --> 02:42:44.440]  I mean, that shows you what's going on in your liver is all I'm saying.
[02:42:44.440 --> 02:42:52.440]  Flush it out. Consult your physician because this is a real cleanse. It's not a game. Infowarslife.com.
[02:42:52.440 --> 02:42:58.440]  Okay. Finally, please support our local MNFM affiliates.
[02:42:58.440 --> 02:43:02.440]  Become a sponsor, thank their sponsors, support their sponsors and spread the word.
[02:43:02.440 --> 02:43:06.440]  Now is not the time for half measures.
[02:43:06.440 --> 02:43:10.440]  People are really ready to listen now because things are getting so serious.
[02:43:10.440 --> 02:43:15.440]  And if folks out there that have means don't take action and don't spread the word.
[02:43:15.440 --> 02:43:22.440]  I mean, if I was a well to do businessman listening to this show or businesswoman listening to this show anywhere in the country,
[02:43:22.440 --> 02:43:28.440]  AM, FM, internet, however you're listening, I would put up a billboard about the show.
[02:43:28.440 --> 02:43:33.440]  I'm not ashamed to ask you that. I'm risking my life doing this. I'm going all out. I need your help.
[02:43:33.440 --> 02:43:38.440]  I mean, I'm committed to this fight. I know we can beat these people at least back them off and have a soft landing.
[02:43:38.440 --> 02:43:44.440]  But if we don't see a maximum effort and everybody just sees themselves as a spectator and not somebody on the field,
[02:43:44.440 --> 02:43:49.440]  we're going to lose this war. How about, you know, people say they want the South to rise again?
[02:43:49.440 --> 02:43:53.440]  How about America rises again? How about freedom rises again?
[02:43:53.440 --> 02:43:58.440]  How about common sense rises again?
[02:43:58.440 --> 02:44:02.440]  And these are some of the billboards around the country. That one right there was in Tennessee.
[02:44:02.440 --> 02:44:06.440]  Let's go back and people ought to copy that design and put it up in their area.
[02:44:06.440 --> 02:44:11.440]  Don't listen to Alex Jones period. It's got a big image of Obama info wars.com.
[02:44:11.440 --> 02:44:17.440]  And I told folks I'd take action. I put up two in Austin. That's as much as our budget can do, but it just hit me.
[02:44:17.440 --> 02:44:23.440]  I just told Buckley to put up this other design that just said info wars.com forbidden information.
[02:44:23.440 --> 02:44:35.440]  We ought to put up if we haven't already sent it that one with Obama that says don't listen to Alex Jones period info wars.com.
[02:44:35.440 --> 02:44:39.440]  That one's even better.
[02:44:39.440 --> 02:44:46.440]  You send that over to the graphics folks. I think there's a copy of that graphic online and there's a lot of other cool ones out there.
[02:44:46.440 --> 02:44:51.440]  I think that was the artist rendering of one, but then I know that billboard was put up.
[02:44:51.440 --> 02:44:58.440]  So I saw other photos that we're talking about and like the news was like, is it legal to put down our Lord and savior?
[02:44:58.440 --> 02:45:03.440]  All right, let me shut up now.
[02:45:03.440 --> 02:45:10.440]  Jonathan Gruber, if that story would have kept getting bigger was the type of thing that could bring down the current agenda.
[02:45:10.440 --> 02:45:20.440]  Him laughing to a bunch of academics and them nodding their sickening cult heads and their gang about how to lie to the public and how he helped fix the numbers.
[02:45:20.440 --> 02:45:23.440]  That it massively increased prices, but he helped cover it up.
[02:45:23.440 --> 02:45:31.440]  And then Obama thanking him in speeches and others thanking him and then him saying, oh, I actually didn't work for Obama and Obama saying he didn't know who he was.
[02:45:31.440 --> 02:45:35.440]  We're going to play some of these clips to remind folks because it's back on the news.
[02:45:35.440 --> 02:45:46.440]  We should push Gruber back out there, the dishonorable rat like little sniveling dishonorable piece of crap who thinks it's funny to raise old people and poor people's prices.
[02:45:46.440 --> 02:45:50.440]  Just that makes me cringe.
[02:45:50.440 --> 02:45:58.440]  Email show MIT's Jonathan Gruber had even more to do with Obama cares passage than previously thought.
[02:45:58.440 --> 02:46:09.440]  And then it goes through the fact that the Wall Street Journal and others report that they've now got the email showing and he was one of the main engineers of it and was basically thanked as being one of the top guys, which we already knew.
[02:46:09.440 --> 02:46:11.440]  But it just triples the lie.
[02:46:11.440 --> 02:46:13.440]  Yeah, I ran the whole thing.
[02:46:13.440 --> 02:46:14.440]  They hired me to help lie.
[02:46:14.440 --> 02:46:15.440]  Obama, we love you.
[02:46:15.440 --> 02:46:16.440]  We thank you, Gruber.
[02:46:16.440 --> 02:46:17.440]  Obama, I don't know him.
[02:46:17.440 --> 02:46:18.440]  Never knew him, Gruber.
[02:46:18.440 --> 02:46:19.440]  I don't know Obama.
[02:46:19.440 --> 02:46:21.440]  Now we have emails showing they did.
[02:46:21.440 --> 02:46:33.440]  I mean, they're liars any way you slice it, they're hardcore crooks that sit around with a bunch of other scum academics laughing at screwing people.
[02:46:33.440 --> 02:46:37.440]  I mean, yeah, let's go ahead and go to the famous Gruber Club.
[02:46:37.440 --> 02:46:39.440]  Here it is.
[02:46:39.440 --> 02:46:41.440]  It's just you can't do it politically.
[02:46:41.440 --> 02:46:42.440]  You just literally cannot do it.
[02:46:42.440 --> 02:46:43.440]  Okay.
[02:46:43.440 --> 02:46:44.440]  Transparent financing.
[02:46:44.440 --> 02:46:53.440]  Unless not transparent financing, also transparent spending. I mean, this bill was written in a tortured way to make sure CBO did not score the mandate as taxes.
[02:46:53.440 --> 02:46:56.440]  If CBO scored the mandate as taxes, the bill dies.
[02:46:56.440 --> 02:46:57.440]  Okay.
[02:46:57.440 --> 02:46:58.440]  So it was written to do that.
[02:46:58.440 --> 02:47:07.440]  In terms of risk-rated subsidies, if you get a law which said healthy people are going to pay in, it may be explicit that healthy people pay in and sick people get money, it would not have passed.
[02:47:07.440 --> 02:47:08.440]  Okay.
[02:47:08.440 --> 02:47:13.440]  Just like the people, lack of transparency is a huge political advantage.
[02:47:13.440 --> 02:47:17.440]  And basically, you know, call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever.
[02:47:17.440 --> 02:47:21.440]  But basically, that was really, really critical to getting the thing to pass.
[02:47:21.440 --> 02:47:23.440]  And, you know, it's the second best argument.
[02:47:23.440 --> 02:47:24.440]  Look, I wish Mark was right.
[02:47:24.440 --> 02:47:25.440]  We can make it transparent.
[02:47:25.440 --> 02:47:26.440]  That's good.
[02:47:26.440 --> 02:47:27.440]  But I'd rather have this law than not.
[02:47:27.440 --> 02:47:29.440]  I'd rather have this law to keep it secret.
[02:47:29.440 --> 02:47:35.440]  Just like they're keeping TPP secret, lack of political transparency.
[02:47:35.440 --> 02:47:45.440]  Charity, dictatorship, and they all sit around because they're wearing suits and talking in nerd vices like, it's okay to rip people off, you crook.
[02:47:45.440 --> 02:47:51.440]  There's a few people I'd like to slap upside the head, but I'd say he's one of them.
[02:47:51.440 --> 02:47:53.440]  If we were going to have social health care, that'd be bad enough.
[02:47:53.440 --> 02:47:56.440]  This is a diabolical screw job by the insurance companies.
[02:47:56.440 --> 02:47:58.440]  But because it's liberal, it's okay.
[02:47:58.440 --> 02:48:01.440]  Let's go to Gribber saying Obama was in the room.
[02:48:01.440 --> 02:48:02.440]  Here it is.
[02:48:02.440 --> 02:48:05.440]  He's saying that's real cost control that we know it'll work, go after this.
[02:48:05.440 --> 02:48:07.440]  Now, the problem is it's a political nightmare.
[02:48:07.440 --> 02:48:09.440]  And people say, no, you can't tax my benefits.
[02:48:09.440 --> 02:48:10.440]  It feels like.
[02:48:10.440 --> 02:48:16.440]  So what we did a lot in that room was think about, well, how could talk about, well, how could we make this work?
[02:48:16.440 --> 02:48:19.440]  And Obama's like, well, you know, I mean, he's really a realistic guy.
[02:48:19.440 --> 02:48:21.440]  It's like, look, I can't just do this.
[02:48:21.440 --> 02:48:23.440]  He said, it's just not going to happen politically.
[02:48:23.440 --> 02:48:24.440]  The bill will not pass.
[02:48:24.440 --> 02:48:26.440]  How do we manage to get there through phasins and other things?
[02:48:26.440 --> 02:48:27.440]  And we talked about it.
[02:48:27.440 --> 02:48:29.440]  And he was just very interested in that topic.
[02:48:29.440 --> 02:48:34.440]  And once again, that ultimately became the genesis of what's called the Cadillac tax in the health care bill,
[02:48:34.440 --> 02:48:38.440]  which I think is one of the most important and bravest parts of the health care law.
[02:48:38.440 --> 02:48:39.440]  That's braved a lot.
[02:48:39.440 --> 02:48:41.440]  And doesn't get nearly enough credit.
[02:48:41.440 --> 02:48:42.440]  Yep.
[02:48:42.440 --> 02:48:43.440]  In your face.
[02:48:43.440 --> 02:48:45.440]  Now, let's go to Obama saying he didn't know Gruber.
[02:48:45.440 --> 02:48:47.440]  Here it is.
[02:48:47.440 --> 02:48:52.440]  I do inspire young leaders by saying governments need to be held accountable and be responsive to the people.
[02:48:52.440 --> 02:48:58.440]  I wonder how you square that with your former advisor, Jonathan Gruber, claiming you were not transparent
[02:48:58.440 --> 02:49:02.440]  about the health law, because in his words, the American people, the voters are stupid.
[02:49:02.440 --> 02:49:08.440]  Did you mislead Americans about the taxes, about keeping your plan in order to get the bill passed?
[02:49:08.440 --> 02:49:10.440]  No, I did not.
[02:49:10.440 --> 02:49:12.440]  Not again.
[02:49:12.440 --> 02:49:14.440]  I just heard about this.
[02:49:14.440 --> 02:49:17.440]  I get well briefed before I come out here.
[02:49:17.440 --> 02:49:27.440]  The fact that some advisor who never worked on our staff expressed an opinion that I completely disagree with
[02:49:27.440 --> 02:49:32.440]  in terms of the voters is no reflection on the actual process that was run.
[02:49:32.440 --> 02:49:34.440]  We had a...
[02:49:34.440 --> 02:49:35.440]  That's good.
[02:49:35.440 --> 02:49:38.440]  Let's go to him thanking Gruber with Gruber in the room.
[02:49:38.440 --> 02:49:41.440]  Here is Obama a year before.
[02:49:41.440 --> 02:49:48.440]  You've already drawn some of the brightest minds from academia and policy circles.
[02:49:48.440 --> 02:49:51.440]  Many of them I've stolen ideas from liberally.
[02:49:51.440 --> 02:49:59.440]  People ranging from Robert Gordon to Austin Gulsby, John Gruber, my dear friend Jim Wallace here,
[02:49:59.440 --> 02:50:07.440]  who can inform what are sometimes dry policy debates with a prophetic voice.
[02:50:07.440 --> 02:50:08.440]  All right.
[02:50:08.440 --> 02:50:11.440]  And now we have the emails that he was absolutely one of the man architects.
[02:50:11.440 --> 02:50:13.440]  Of course he was.
[02:50:13.440 --> 02:50:16.440]  And he's out there lecturing other academics on how to deceive people.
[02:50:16.440 --> 02:50:19.440]  I mean, the guy needs to be indicted for fraud.
[02:50:19.440 --> 02:50:23.440]  But the blackmailed Supreme Court continues to uphold Obamacare,
[02:50:23.440 --> 02:50:27.440]  which is the most ridiculously criminal unconstitutional joke.
[02:50:27.440 --> 02:50:31.440]  I mean, on its face you can't give thousands of companies waivers to not be part of it
[02:50:31.440 --> 02:50:33.440]  and everyone else has to be part of it.
[02:50:33.440 --> 02:50:36.440]  That's called discrimination.
[02:50:36.440 --> 02:50:38.440]  But you've got all the other facets to it.
[02:50:38.440 --> 02:50:44.440]  I mean, you know, foreign insurance companies' profits are up 47% two years into this,
[02:50:44.440 --> 02:50:48.440]  globally off-screwing us.
[02:50:48.440 --> 02:50:53.440]  I mean, Obamacare is a royal, royal fraud.
[02:50:53.440 --> 02:51:20.440]  And notice it isn't repealed because the bipartisan scum wanted people like Boehner.
[02:51:20.440 --> 02:51:45.440]  And that's all I have to say about Obamacare.
[02:51:45.440 --> 02:52:11.440]  That's all I have to say about Obamacare.
[02:52:11.440 --> 02:52:33.440]  That's all I have to say about Obamacare.
[02:52:33.440 --> 02:52:58.440]  Thank you for watching.
[02:52:58.440 --> 02:53:24.440]  I'll see you in the next video.
[02:53:28.440 --> 02:53:57.440]  Thanks for watching.
[02:53:59.440 --> 02:54:02.440]  Good news.
[02:54:02.440 --> 02:54:06.440]  General Mills is dropping artificial flavors and colors from its entire line of cereals.
[02:54:06.440 --> 02:54:09.440]  That's because of people voting with their dollars.
[02:54:09.440 --> 02:54:13.440]  We see huge successes like this every few days now.
[02:54:13.440 --> 02:54:18.440]  The bad news is, and I meant to cover this more today, I will tomorrow.
[02:54:18.440 --> 02:54:21.440]  The Earth enters its six-extinction phase.
[02:54:21.440 --> 02:54:24.440]  I covered that some yesterday, but it's so big I'm going to cover it some tomorrow.
[02:54:24.440 --> 02:54:31.440]  And this AP article, the big announcement, Secretary of Defense, U.S. to provide weapons, aircraft, commandos for NATO.
[02:54:31.440 --> 02:54:40.440]  And you read the statements by NATO and the head of the Department of Defense, the Department of World War III, the Department of Starting Wars.
[02:54:40.440 --> 02:54:42.440]  Used to call the Department of War.
[02:54:42.440 --> 02:54:44.440]  That's forever, Bernays had it renamed Department of Defense.
[02:54:44.440 --> 02:54:46.440]  See, it's all just spin.
[02:54:46.440 --> 02:54:55.440]  They're giving command and control, intelligence, surveillance capabilities, special operations forces, logistics, transport aircraft, and a range of weapons support.
[02:54:55.440 --> 02:55:00.440]  They include bombers, fighters, and ship-based missiles.
[02:55:00.440 --> 02:55:02.440]  Whoa!
[02:55:02.440 --> 02:55:04.440]  I should have started the show with that.
[02:55:04.440 --> 02:55:08.440]  You know, Kurt Nemo, I read that this morning and just said, oh my God, World War III.
[02:55:08.440 --> 02:55:17.440]  Nemo wrote a great article, but the headline should not be, U.S. will provide weapons for NATO commandos to attack Ukrainian separatists.
[02:55:17.440 --> 02:55:23.440]  It's NATO accelerates war against Russia, heavy weapons to be deployed.
[02:55:23.440 --> 02:55:25.440]  I mean, I don't even know how to describe this.
[02:55:25.440 --> 02:55:27.440]  I don't even have a headline that's hardcore enough.
[02:55:27.440 --> 02:55:32.440]  This is a wild escalation.
[02:55:32.440 --> 02:55:35.440]  In fact, I'm going to shoot a special report for the night we news.
[02:55:35.440 --> 02:55:36.440]  I really dropped the ball.
[02:55:36.440 --> 02:55:38.440]  The whole show should have been about this.
[02:55:38.440 --> 02:55:47.440]  But, you know, I mentioned at the first of the show that's coming up in rebroadcast that this is all part of the insanity running towards the collapse,
[02:55:47.440 --> 02:55:52.440]  where the West goes in and topples the Ukrainian government, puts the government in.
[02:55:52.440 --> 02:55:54.440]  The East is mainly Russian.
[02:55:54.440 --> 02:55:55.440]  They start attacking the Russians.
[02:55:55.440 --> 02:55:58.440]  The Russians give some supply and logistics to help the people.
[02:55:58.440 --> 02:55:59.440]  They didn't start it.
[02:55:59.440 --> 02:56:05.440]  And now they've had commandos and trainers there, but now they're escalating it to bombers.
[02:56:05.440 --> 02:56:11.440]  I guess they're going to stick Ukrainian pilots in NATO aircraft and start.
[02:56:11.440 --> 02:56:14.440]  You know, that means there's going to be NATO fighter pilots.
[02:56:14.440 --> 02:56:15.440]  This is wild.
[02:56:15.440 --> 02:56:17.440]  And Russia will escalate.
[02:56:17.440 --> 02:56:26.440]  And this will be an actual war, undeclared, like Vietnam was for five years, from 59 to 64,
[02:56:26.440 --> 02:56:39.440]  an undeclared war with Russia and not in Southeast Asia, not in Africa, but in Ukraine, where Russia's had more than 10 wars.
[02:56:39.440 --> 02:56:44.440]  I mean, that is crazy.
[02:56:44.440 --> 02:56:51.440]  Here's an important clip of a U.S. senator asking Obama, what gun laws should we have had to stop this fruit ball going in and shooting people in Charleston?
[02:56:51.440 --> 02:56:52.440]  Here's this clip.
[02:56:52.440 --> 02:57:01.440]  Well, I think the President's office on this one, to be honest with you, the fact of the matter is that what type of gun law would have made this situation not occur?
[02:57:01.440 --> 02:57:10.440]  Frankly, he was already breaking gun laws that currently exist when he went into a church with a gun, when as a person charged with a felony, he had a gun.
[02:57:10.440 --> 02:57:19.440]  So the laws were already broken to suggest that there's somehow a way for us to specifically stop this occurrence with gun legislation.
[02:57:19.440 --> 02:57:24.440]  Gun legislation seems to be inconsistent with the facts as we know them on the ground.
[02:57:24.440 --> 02:57:25.440]  He had a handgun.
[02:57:25.440 --> 02:57:27.440]  This was not an automatic weapon.
[02:57:27.440 --> 02:57:34.440]  So there's really no conversation to be had that somehow the gun laws that we have are not working.
[02:57:34.440 --> 02:57:45.440]  The fact is that had the gun laws been enforced, and frankly, it's not an enforcement issue, but had the guy obeyed the gun laws, we would not be here.
[02:57:45.440 --> 02:57:49.440]  But the challenge is that laws are created for a just society.
[02:57:49.440 --> 02:57:53.440]  This guy was not trying to be a part of a just society.
[02:57:53.440 --> 02:57:58.440]  Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, what a great senator on the surface.
[02:57:58.440 --> 02:58:00.440]  He makes great sense.
[02:58:00.440 --> 02:58:01.440]  But I remember reading the names.
[02:58:01.440 --> 02:58:03.440]  I think he voted for TPP.
[02:58:03.440 --> 02:58:04.440]  We need to check that vote.
[02:58:04.440 --> 02:58:05.440]  You can have such good people.
[02:58:05.440 --> 02:58:11.440]  That guy has nice eyes, has a friendly demeanor, has a good voting record on a bunch of issues.
[02:58:11.440 --> 02:58:13.440]  But he comes off as Christian and good.
[02:58:13.440 --> 02:58:16.440]  I mean, and then he's TPP.
[02:58:16.440 --> 02:58:17.440]  I want to check that.
[02:58:17.440 --> 02:58:21.440]  I'm going from memory and look it up real quick.
[02:58:21.440 --> 02:58:24.440]  Senator Scott's vote on TPP.
[02:58:24.440 --> 02:58:25.440]  I want to see on that.
[02:58:25.440 --> 02:58:28.440]  It just opens it up to a larger discussion.
[02:58:28.440 --> 02:58:34.440]  Tonight, 7 o'clock Central will have an emergency report on World War III and more.
[02:58:34.440 --> 02:58:44.440]  Re-transmission starts now at infowars.com for last show and rears on some fine stations.
[02:58:44.440 --> 02:59:08.440]  Pray for the dead and their families in Charleston and others.
