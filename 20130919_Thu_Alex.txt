[01:04.000 --> 01:08.640]  on the free press that's accelerating I want to get into that in more detail
[01:08.640 --> 01:12.840]  today Kurt Nemo has an article titled Matt Drudge and Alex Jones are 17-year-old
[01:12.840 --> 01:20.160]  bloggers according to Diane Feinstein and Paul family preparing for Rand Paul
[01:20.160 --> 01:26.720]  2016 presidential bid experts this is really the big news say Feds QE
[01:26.720 --> 01:31.080]  unlimited will lead to total collapse that's a quote and there's a new
[01:31.080 --> 01:35.600]  article going up breaking where Ron Paul says Bernanke knows that the economy
[01:35.600 --> 01:42.200]  is really in bad shape that is a quote that article is going up in mere minutes
[01:42.200 --> 01:46.920]  Kit Daniels is publishing it right now at presentplanet.com and info wars.com
[01:46.920 --> 01:54.240]  also Obama says raising the debt ceiling does not increase our debt though it
[01:54.240 --> 01:58.760]  has 100 times before this is like them saying the polar bears can't swim and
[01:58.760 --> 02:04.240]  they're all dying or saying that gun crime is up when it's actually down 49
[02:04.240 --> 02:08.120]  percent according to the Justice Department some numbers everything they
[02:08.120 --> 02:14.320]  do is a fraud Obama came out Sunday and said there's an 80 to 90 percent of the
[02:14.320 --> 02:21.000]  American people support having their guns taken basically and it's almost the
[02:21.000 --> 02:26.600]  opposite around 70% in the last big polls were against new gun laws and
[02:26.600 --> 02:29.040]  that's on average somewhere more somewhere less but the point is it's
[02:29.040 --> 02:36.280]  around 70% he just says the opposite this is the wall of fraud that they're
[02:36.280 --> 02:40.320]  putting out and people say well that's hamfisted they're they're falling apart
[02:40.320 --> 02:45.880]  no they're training you to just accept that they're gonna lie to you and then
[02:45.880 --> 02:50.960]  they have the paramilitary force to back up any type of takeover they want to
[02:50.960 --> 02:54.600]  engage in this is what it's really coming down to in this country but people
[02:54.600 --> 03:00.120]  are waking up that is some good news again on the economic front Mark Faber
[03:00.120 --> 03:05.040]  we're gonna get him back on he had been on a while says feds money printing
[03:05.040 --> 03:13.360]  about protecting the elite no kidding Aaron Alexis carved my ELF or basically
[03:13.360 --> 03:19.840]  frequency weapon on the stock of his shotgun government estimates a flu
[03:19.840 --> 03:23.680]  pandemic would kill at least two million that's just some of the news up on
[03:23.680 --> 03:30.760]  infowars.com and prisonplanet.com and more globalist David Attenborough
[03:30.760 --> 03:36.000]  saying stop feeding the third world nations to reduce world population
[03:36.000 --> 03:42.880]  Anthony Guciardi wrote that article that came out last night very very important
[03:42.880 --> 03:49.680]  to read his quotes published publicly he is very very proud of himself giving
[03:49.680 --> 03:54.280]  the interview of the Daily Telegraph and the issue is you can say there's too
[03:54.280 --> 03:58.000]  many people you can believe that if you want the issue is we're all being
[03:58.000 --> 04:03.400]  targeted by these silent weapons for quiet wars by these soft kill weapons
[04:03.400 --> 04:08.920]  it's on record I remember the Baltimore Sun about 14 years ago I've been able
[04:08.920 --> 04:13.280]  unable to find it since then I was actually mailed by listeners the actual
[04:13.280 --> 04:17.840]  newspaper somebody ought to go dig that out go to the microfilm and get it and
[04:17.840 --> 04:22.440]  it was about DARPA DARPA developing new technologies and in the article they
[04:22.440 --> 04:27.560]  were interviewing the DARPA director at that time it was in residency at MIT if
[04:27.560 --> 04:31.680]  I remember correctly and they were saying oh we were practicing with the cell
[04:31.680 --> 04:37.600]  towers with frequencies to make you be calm and happy and I'm like reading this
[04:37.600 --> 04:42.200]  in the newspaper and I knew this stuff was going on but there are real
[04:42.200 --> 04:45.920]  schizophrenics out there but how many people that have gone crazy have gone
[04:45.920 --> 04:50.640]  crazy because of all the electromagnetic pollution that they admit is
[04:50.640 --> 04:55.760]  is affecting birds plants other animals insects I mean this is serious we're
[04:55.760 --> 04:59.360]  gonna be looking at that today as well
[04:59.360 --> 05:04.000]  why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world
[05:04.000 --> 05:08.080]  on health care why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet the
[05:08.080 --> 05:14.120]  highest rates of diabetes autism and every other major disease it all comes
[05:14.120 --> 05:19.240]  down to one thing we are what we eat our food is devoid of nutrition and
[05:19.240 --> 05:24.320]  processed with poisons and additives our water is filled with toxic poisons and
[05:24.320 --> 05:29.440]  big pharma runoff all of this has been engineered by design we can turn the
[05:29.440 --> 05:33.520]  tide against the eugenicists by giving ourselves the nutrients our body

[08:32.760 --> 08:41.200]  law mega corporations who are openly playing God and trying to take control
[08:41.200 --> 08:49.320]  of society and here are the headlines today dealing with that will be uploading
[08:49.320 --> 08:54.200]  our entire minds to computers and our bodies will be replaced by machines
[08:54.200 --> 09:01.960]  Google expert claims that's daily mail time magazine can Google solve death how
[09:01.960 --> 09:08.080]  CEO Larry Page has transformed the search engine giant into a factory for
[09:08.080 --> 09:14.440]  moonshots or a factory of trying to stop this dehumanization our exclusive
[09:14.440 --> 09:21.600]  look at the boldest bet yet now again folks Google is the main node along with
[09:21.600 --> 09:28.520]  Microsoft IBM and others of the eugenics based complex so they always give you
[09:28.520 --> 09:35.560]  these great flowery reasons that they're establishing different systems but in
[09:35.560 --> 09:41.000]  it all in their own words is the move to establish a authoritarian planetary
[09:41.000 --> 09:47.680]  regime and once that authoritarian planetary regime is established to
[09:47.680 --> 09:52.840]  carry out the orderly extermination of the population and yes they believe
[09:52.840 --> 09:55.880]  they're going to merge with machines and live forever I put that in in game
[09:55.880 --> 10:02.000]  seven years ago and have been criticized by the New York Times CNN the
[10:02.000 --> 10:07.720]  Washington Post literally more than a hundred times they quote the film in
[10:07.720 --> 10:14.440]  establishment media state-run media and say that I claim all this is happening
[10:14.440 --> 10:20.480]  in fact this week they had a bunch of White House globalist run media
[10:20.480 --> 10:26.600]  publications come out and say that Alex Jones threatens that cyborg robots are
[10:26.600 --> 10:33.520]  going to attack from Syria and kill everyone that's not what I said I was
[10:33.520 --> 10:42.320]  quoting top scientist and physicist and futurist on record that we're in the
[10:42.320 --> 10:48.400]  news again saying that that is the plan in the future once they've disarmed all
[10:48.400 --> 10:53.440]  of the final independent nations that have weapons that could resist any of
[10:53.440 --> 10:59.160]  this then a planetary regime will be established and then there will be a
[10:59.160 --> 11:05.640]  forced population reduction carried out that is openly being called for in
[11:05.640 --> 11:13.320]  major publications today and right before the break I was reading some of
[11:13.320 --> 11:19.040]  those quotes by Atom Burrow and others coming out saying it's time to basically
[11:19.040 --> 11:25.880]  wipe out the third world and notice this is normally from liberal academics and
[11:25.880 --> 11:31.840]  naturalist who say they're for multiculturalism and and you know get
[11:31.840 --> 11:37.640]  rid of the family and teach homosexuality all this just so people don't
[11:37.640 --> 11:43.440]  have any unifying culture left and so that it's not cool to have children it's
[11:43.440 --> 11:47.720]  literally ultimate greed they're attacking the West that they see as
[11:47.720 --> 11:52.680]  their main challenge number one while attacking the third world just out of
[11:52.680 --> 11:57.040]  hand because there's no media complex or government complex or cultural
[11:57.040 --> 12:01.400]  complex in the third world that can organize against this but David Atom
[12:01.400 --> 12:06.000]  Burrow has come out and stated what is in all their publications they're on
[12:06.000 --> 12:11.680]  record hitting us with psychotronic wavelength weapon systems they're on
[12:11.680 --> 12:19.920]  record designing all the GMO with recombinant RNA and DNA weapon systems
[12:19.920 --> 12:24.800]  that really it's nanotech but genetically based they are hitting us all
[12:24.800 --> 12:29.880]  with hundreds of chemicals in the water supply with hydrofluorosalistic acid as
[12:29.880 --> 12:36.280]  the boosting adjuvant this is all on record silent weapons for quiet wars
[12:36.280 --> 12:40.960]  Pentagon documents I'm just I'm giving you the names right now soft kill
[12:40.960 --> 12:47.400]  prospectus 1968 MIT Stanford Research Institute I mean I'm giving it all to
[12:47.400 --> 12:51.720]  you right now anybody that wants to go find out about this and the insane part
[12:51.720 --> 12:58.200]  is the Pentagon the CIA people 99.9% of them are compartmentalized and are all
[12:58.200 --> 13:02.800]  being attacked by this as well there there will be no winners in this they're
[13:02.800 --> 13:07.920]  going to kill everybody and right now you just see them trying to shut down the
[13:07.920 --> 13:13.200]  final sovereign nations trying to develop their super weapons their nanotech
[13:13.200 --> 13:17.720]  putting it in place trying to set up their new takeover system of the
[13:17.720 --> 13:23.240]  internet that was that was always designed for this reason so that's the
[13:23.240 --> 13:29.200]  big picture okay we are in the 21st century 13 years almost 14 years into
[13:29.200 --> 13:33.000]  it the globalists are at least 30 years advanced in what you're seeing rolled
[13:33.000 --> 13:37.280]  out every piece of technology that is allowed to be rolled out that is seen as
[13:37.280 --> 13:44.320]  non-disruptive has been certified triple studied triple tested to be deployed
[13:44.320 --> 13:51.080]  against the people every color scheme every flicker wavelength of a television
[13:51.080 --> 14:00.400]  set every system that is standardized by the technocracy is designed to
[14:00.400 --> 14:06.160]  basically hack the human mind and create a total artificial reality in which to
[14:06.160 --> 14:13.200]  insert us we are seen as energy by the globalist we are literally seen as
[14:13.200 --> 14:17.960]  batteries and human resources notice their terms are all hiding in plain view
[14:17.960 --> 14:24.040]  to build their their world government to build their technological system and
[14:24.040 --> 14:28.360]  then we are to be cold and you can actually argue that there are almost
[14:28.360 --> 14:32.120]  eight million people and that humans are very toxic and we are hurting the
[14:32.120 --> 14:37.120]  earth and so from their perspective they're very altruistic the truth is
[14:37.120 --> 14:44.240]  though if you study them they're very inbred very hateful very decadent very
[14:44.240 --> 14:48.960]  mentally ill and actually are targeting the most beautiful and intelligent of
[14:48.960 --> 14:56.120]  the human species and I'm not endorsing eugenics here I'm saying I see what they
[14:56.120 --> 15:01.360]  sell the average academic on the average banking executive on the average
[15:01.360 --> 15:04.120]  high-level lawyer people make it a million bucks a year who think they're
[15:04.120 --> 15:07.600]  part of the elite and go to the same golf courses and get to go to the same
[15:07.600 --> 15:17.040]  events and are kind of court court minions of the system you are the main
[15:17.040 --> 15:28.280]  target of these people and and this is what you need to understand ladies and
[15:28.280 --> 15:34.640]  gentlemen it is absolutely essential you con yourself if you think you can be
[15:34.640 --> 15:38.800]  part of the winning team in this there are six thousand superclass members
[15:38.800 --> 15:42.400]  according to the Kissinger group and in the published work of the head of it
[15:42.400 --> 15:49.200]  Rothkopf in superclass the book came out eight years ago when I interviewed
[15:49.200 --> 15:52.880]  Rothkopf during the breaks he was trying to recruit me in front of John
[15:52.880 --> 15:57.400]  Harmon John Harmon heard that conversation he said well this isn't going
[15:57.400 --> 16:00.640]  to well I thought you'd be reasonable you know you're a smart guy you could be
[16:00.640 --> 16:03.880]  part of the superclass you already are is it a people that kind of doubt you
[16:03.880 --> 16:08.560]  conspiracy theorist but I'll tell you you know I thought you'd be more
[16:08.560 --> 16:13.920]  reasonable be more reasonable with people that jack the water supply with
[16:13.920 --> 16:18.320]  chemical weapons be more reasonable with people that are engineering all the
[16:18.320 --> 16:22.440]  major food crops as pharmacological crops even if they're not listed as a
[16:22.440 --> 16:27.720]  pharmacological crop you know folks the vaccines are now grown in corn you know
[16:27.720 --> 16:33.080]  they now grow chemical warfare agents in corn you know they've been growing for
[16:33.080 --> 16:37.920]  20 years HIV virus in corn every time I say that they have a news article going
[16:37.920 --> 16:43.880]  he's insane they says that there's HIV and corn and then people in the
[16:43.880 --> 16:47.760]  comments are always like well I looked it up it's true protege in in Texas and
[16:47.760 --> 16:53.040]  other areas oh I why it's true there what are they doing it's they can then
[16:53.040 --> 16:57.520]  extract it out of the corn you could engineer a plant to grow whatever you
[16:57.520 --> 17:02.800]  want the fact they can engineer plants to actually grow ethanol alcohol in them
[17:02.800 --> 17:09.240]  without even having to manufacture it into that I mean this is how far along
[17:09.240 --> 17:12.720]  all of this is yeah there's an article right there by Aaron Dyke's flashback
[17:12.720 --> 17:18.280]  escaped mutated GM maize on the loose maybe carrying AIDS virus well yeah
[17:18.280 --> 17:25.840]  there's no maybe about it they argued that it is a attenuated virus growing in
[17:25.840 --> 17:31.400]  the corn but the point is there it is fungus tainted corn a factor in Africa
[17:31.400 --> 17:36.600]  HIV spread Reuters health I didn't even know about that please print that for
[17:36.600 --> 17:41.880]  me ladies and gentlemen Bill Gates is spending billions a year of taxpayer
[17:41.880 --> 17:46.800]  money he's given to study how to attack your intestines and then how to come out
[17:46.800 --> 17:52.680]  with treatments for the attack on your intestines gut flora I mean see that's
[17:52.680 --> 17:58.080]  what's so frustrating I have got more than 150 bombshell news articles all
[17:58.080 --> 18:03.600]  off the charts I've got to cover them I've got to go over the QE 3 unlimited
[18:03.600 --> 18:08.120]  and how all the major economists even Bernanke's having to admit the
[18:08.120 --> 18:12.320]  economy's in deep trouble it's a greatest transfer of wealth of the elite ever it
[18:12.320 --> 18:18.320]  is a mass larceny bum rush takeover of biblical proportions we're gonna get into
[18:18.320 --> 18:22.840]  that we're gonna go to the confirmed Navy Yard shooter was on anti-depressant
[18:22.840 --> 18:26.800]  of course he was that's now admitted in the Washington Post but they say it's no
[18:26.800 --> 18:30.720]  big deal it's good for you they literally say that they lie to you they say
[18:30.720 --> 18:35.360]  there are no side effects of vaccines read the insert it is weaponized media
[18:35.360 --> 18:40.880]  weaponized culture you're all under attack any idiots working for the system

[33:18.840 --> 33:24.960]  bed America your government is in control defending the Republic from
[33:24.960 --> 33:31.560]  enemies foreign and domestic it's Alex Jones
[33:35.680 --> 33:41.640]  we're watching our country our families our farms our factories our
[33:41.640 --> 33:49.920]  culture scientifically dismantled to make way for a bunch of degenerate inbred
[33:49.920 --> 33:59.280]  control freak globalist that for over 150 years out of London England have
[33:59.280 --> 34:05.000]  developed the total takeover plan it's all public and the enemy media knows the
[34:05.000 --> 34:08.760]  general public does not read scientific publications are not aware of this so
[34:08.760 --> 34:13.360]  they'll take what I've said today out of context and claim that I'm saying all
[34:13.360 --> 34:17.640]  this I'm not the one saying all this this is an admitted program an admitted
[34:17.640 --> 34:24.640]  plan 100 plus percent documented and by a hundred plus percent I mean it's got
[34:24.640 --> 34:29.400]  to be 10,000 percent documented by that it's they all compete with each other
[34:29.400 --> 34:34.200]  over who can figure out how to hurt the public more without them getting caught
[34:34.200 --> 34:39.240]  they call it silent weapons for quiet wars look up those Pentagon reports they
[34:39.240 --> 34:47.160]  call it soft kill and it's the ultimate power trip for these people that they
[34:47.160 --> 34:51.240]  are doing this to everybody I mean I was reading about the new iPhone 5 that
[34:51.240 --> 34:56.400]  came out that admittedly puts you in a global database and right to the NSA
[34:56.400 --> 35:02.720]  with your thumbprint and it's made at slave factories with suicide nets where
[35:02.720 --> 35:06.640]  they drug them and do forced abortions inside the facilities and they make you
[35:06.640 --> 35:11.560]  sign contracts agreeing to this but it's it's like you know or that are
[35:11.560 --> 35:14.400]  starved to death so it's not a real contract it's a fraudulent contract
[35:14.400 --> 35:20.520]  because you've been you know squeezed into doing it and the worst factories are
[35:20.520 --> 35:27.200]  run by Apple but it's okay because they're liberal it's it's just like so
[35:27.200 --> 35:34.280]  sick and I need a new iPhone I mean I know it's a tracking system I use it to
[35:34.280 --> 35:38.440]  shoot live videos a very powerful tool it'd be a great tool they hadn't put all
[35:38.440 --> 35:46.240]  these back doors in it if they hadn't designed it to dehumanize so now I want
[35:46.240 --> 35:51.760]  to go get this replaced I've got to get one that prepares everybody to thumb
[35:51.760 --> 35:55.840]  print to buy and sell and you say well what's wrong with that what's wrong with
[35:55.840 --> 36:02.160]  progress well if angels if the angel Gabriel was running the technocracy it
[36:02.160 --> 36:07.200]  wouldn't be a problem would it but it's not Gabriel that's running it ladies and
[36:07.200 --> 36:12.600]  gentlemen it's Lucifer and I mean and again you can see that as figurative or
[36:12.600 --> 36:16.920]  reality-based doesn't matter it's a it's an archetypal manifestation and it's
[36:16.920 --> 36:20.880]  happening and once they have us in a casual society they will track
[36:20.880 --> 36:24.960]  everything you do and if you don't comply they will turn off your biometrics
[36:24.960 --> 36:29.640]  and they themselves will be exempt as they already are Homeland Security from
[36:29.640 --> 36:34.000]  tickets from red light cameras from license from license plate readers they
[36:34.000 --> 36:39.400]  are invisible and that's one of the Rockefellers famously told the director
[36:39.400 --> 36:46.560]  Aaron Russo he said we're gonna have a chip in us that says kiss my hand in
[36:48.080 --> 36:54.040]  we're gonna have a chip that's get out of jail free card and then about seven
[36:54.040 --> 37:00.520]  years ago I'm in a family reunion and one of my family members it's in special
[37:00.520 --> 37:08.080]  operations said I gotta apologize to you we just got called to a big meeting at
[37:08.080 --> 37:13.480]  the Medical Center at Fort Sam Houston and all the officers were told it's
[37:13.480 --> 37:18.040]  highly classified but that all the top officers in our group and others are
[37:18.040 --> 37:21.560]  gonna start getting microchips and he goes I don't know if it was meant to
[37:21.560 --> 37:25.720]  see what we'd say but I talked to people later and they said no some special
[37:25.720 --> 37:30.400]  officers have already got them I want to apologize to you now just off saying
[37:30.400 --> 37:34.920]  that on air they figured out who it was and went and gotten his face about it
[37:34.920 --> 37:39.840]  oh boy this is really a free country isn't it
[37:44.640 --> 37:49.240]  and then basically hey I'm not talking to you about anything I care about you
[37:49.240 --> 37:56.120]  your family but I think I didn't get this particular promotion because of the
[37:56.120 --> 38:03.080]  fact that I've talked to you so I'm not talking to you anymore in fact I was
[38:03.080 --> 38:06.800]  told that by another family member that he wouldn't talk to me anymore ever
[38:06.800 --> 38:10.960]  won't won't talk to me other than saying hi because I mean that's the system and
[38:10.960 --> 38:15.280]  I'm here on air telling you they're putting brain chips microchips embedded
[38:15.280 --> 38:18.960]  chips in people's teeth everything and then you've got the schizophrenics out
[38:18.960 --> 38:22.600]  there God love them because of all the chemicals and biological problems that
[38:22.600 --> 38:25.480]  are flipping out in this weird world how would you not flip out and then get
[38:25.480 --> 38:31.160]  paranoid I've got an article here where they're coming out and I remember
[38:31.160 --> 38:36.680]  interviewing the CEO of the California based company back when this first
[38:36.680 --> 38:45.920]  happened like in 1998 and it was in Wash Tech what was back when the Washington
[38:45.920 --> 38:50.840]  Post put out a technology magazine and I got him on he goes well we're only
[38:50.840 --> 38:58.080]  deploying it in Tokyo cuz we've tried it out in LA and it upsets people and what
[38:58.080 --> 39:02.560]  it does is it projects sound that even 100 yards when you're walking through a
[39:02.560 --> 39:07.080]  parking lot say at a grocery store and hits you where it with vibrations you
[39:07.080 --> 39:16.800]  hear the audio in your middle ear and then it never really got deployed
[39:16.800 --> 39:21.360]  because people weren't going along with it just like they had face scanning
[39:21.360 --> 39:29.160]  cameras up 20 years ago first sources I saw on that were Pentagon funding
[39:29.160 --> 39:34.480]  reports put in by the Department of Defense in Indiana Indianapolis
[39:34.480 --> 39:42.600]  particularly in Dallas Texas 20 years ago in 1994 so 19 years ago they
[39:42.600 --> 39:47.640]  already had face scanning reading cameras and then they would integrate them
[39:47.640 --> 39:52.880]  with your digital photos at the driver's license they were already testing it and
[39:52.880 --> 39:56.320]  then that was also an MIT magazine later they admitted it's a total they
[39:56.320 --> 40:01.920]  admit this whole thing is weaponized ladies and gentlemen the whole culture
[40:01.920 --> 40:06.760]  it's weaponized aimed at you not to protect you folks to dumb you down to
[40:06.760 --> 40:10.720]  rob your free will and finally kill you dead in a hammer but by the time that
[40:10.720 --> 40:14.880]  happens you're so drugged out so brain damage so confused that you know it
[40:14.880 --> 40:18.240]  won't be a 3,000 percent increase in cancer like it is now on average in the
[40:18.240 --> 40:22.200]  United States similar numbers in Europe breast cancer you name it it'll be 10
[40:22.200 --> 40:25.880]  thousand like it is in pediatric cancers it'll be 20,000 increases in
[40:25.880 --> 40:29.440]  cancers just like we've already seen that level of increase in autism from
[40:29.440 --> 40:33.760]  1 in 25,000 to 1 in 50 something and it's just going to be suddenly everybody
[40:33.760 --> 40:39.280]  is dying the health care had to be nationalized so they cannot give you
[40:39.280 --> 40:42.360]  treatment because it would have bankrupted everything even faster so
[40:42.360 --> 40:45.440]  they're going to nationalize it all so it's now eugenics care
[40:45.440 --> 40:50.760]  under standardization to absorb the dying mass and they're going to kill the
[40:50.760 --> 40:54.040]  baby boomers first the baby boomers are already all getting the word they're
[40:54.040 --> 40:58.440]  dying that matter how much you exercise what you've done you took all those
[40:58.440 --> 41:04.880]  vaccines you ate the GMOs you drank 60 years of fluoride water it's all been
[41:04.880 --> 41:08.280]  actuaried out where they've got drugs try to keep you alive just long enough
[41:08.280 --> 41:13.800]  to suck all the money out of you he'll be dead and then it's going to be as you
[41:13.800 --> 41:16.960]  see neurological disorders in the young just people are already dying
[41:16.960 --> 41:20.240]  everywhere and folks it's going to get worse and worse because it's ambient
[41:20.240 --> 41:27.040]  incremental soft kill where they just slowly turn up the background and just
[41:27.040 --> 41:39.440]  see if people notice okay 1995 99 2001 2002 hey let's just order at this base
[41:39.440 --> 41:43.720]  to give everybody an anthrax vaccine we know has got a bunch of other stuff
[41:43.720 --> 41:47.440]  added to it and it's killing about five percent of people that take it and they
[41:47.440 --> 41:53.320]  would shoot a base up and they'd have 20 people die folks I mean die blood
[41:53.320 --> 42:00.360]  coming out their noses everything I mean this came out in the news one time I
[42:00.360 --> 42:03.440]  had Rick Perry one of his main staffers come to in game he goes look the
[42:03.440 --> 42:06.520]  governor wants you to know he's really good and watch you and where we know
[42:06.520 --> 42:11.240]  what's going on and this is for even did Gardasil and and he goes I want you
[42:11.240 --> 42:15.040]  know I was at Fort Sam Houston again Fort Sam Houston and and they came in
[42:15.040 --> 42:18.680]  and brought special forces and gave them all shots they were all dead four days
[42:18.680 --> 42:21.520]  later then we had to spray bleach all over the place and pull out all the
[42:21.520 --> 42:27.240]  furniture and it was hauled away in trucks I know I know it's real I know
[42:27.240 --> 42:29.920]  you know we look at all the secret testing that's been declassified
[42:29.920 --> 42:33.760]  they're still sterilizing people all of the US it's coming out I mean this is
[42:33.760 --> 42:37.760]  a government that admittedly has done this over and over injecting people with
[42:37.760 --> 42:41.920]  syphilis the list goes on and on you know who they are and I've got all this
[42:41.920 --> 42:46.840]  news to cover but it really hit me and I got almost crazed this morning in the
[42:46.840 --> 42:53.280]  in the in the realization of how real all this is and how I don't want to just
[42:53.280 --> 42:58.680]  sit here and take it and what a joke it is you know you'll see these smug
[42:58.680 --> 43:02.160]  homeland security police and their black uniform standard looking all like like
[43:02.160 --> 43:06.320]  they're movie stars with their guns front of cameras and you know any excuse
[43:06.320 --> 43:10.240]  to boss citizens around and I am and you mean you work for the murderers that
[43:10.240 --> 43:13.840]  run the terrorists run al-qaeda it's all grant they're all children it's all a
[43:13.840 --> 43:18.560]  joke it's all this is such a game I don't get people like peacocks are all
[43:18.560 --> 43:23.440]  into how they look and you know oh I'm a soldier in the homeland and all this
[43:23.440 --> 43:30.200]  it's all a joke it's all a fraud it's all a lie it's all a scam and here it is
[43:30.200 --> 43:36.080]  today out of wired magazine transfer a secret audio message by poking someone
[43:36.080 --> 43:42.760]  with your finger and Disney is coming out of course for children all the toys
[43:42.760 --> 43:47.640]  are about spying and all this other stuff well now the toy is you put on this
[43:47.640 --> 43:52.840]  little rig and then you can transfer audio right to somebody's middle ear
[43:53.840 --> 44:01.120]  and it's an inaudible signal transmitted directly into the person now they
[44:01.120 --> 44:04.840]  had the patents on this in the 50s and you've seen the media make fun of me
[44:04.840 --> 44:10.400]  talking about it they'll probably have articles out tomorrow saying something
[44:10.400 --> 44:14.760]  like Alex says Obama wants to transmit audio into your brain no I'm explaining
[44:14.760 --> 44:20.280]  to you folks we're in the future we're here this is all old this is 50s
[44:20.280 --> 44:26.920]  technology and with was the name Larry Ashbrook they messed up with mind
[44:26.920 --> 44:31.400]  control he was a naval veteran type in Baptist church shooting Fort Worth Larry
[44:31.400 --> 44:35.280]  Ashbrook I want to pull that up it came out in the local news Fort Worth start
[44:35.280 --> 44:38.960]  telegram because I was on the radio at the time 1998 of memory serves let's see
[44:38.960 --> 44:43.400]  if I'm right memory wise that neighbors kept saying white vans will pull up and
[44:43.400 --> 44:48.720]  drag him in screaming and then and he was definitely programmed he was
[44:48.720 --> 44:53.200]  definitely programmed the witnesses saw it and they actually programmed him to
[44:53.200 --> 44:57.320]  go into that church and do that and kill like he killed eight people shot like
[44:57.320 --> 45:04.360]  16 or 17 try pin Baptist Baptist church shooting Fort Worth Larry Ashbrook hit
[45:04.360 --> 45:11.560]  web not news it's old hit web it'll come up we'll see about memory serves so so I
[45:11.560 --> 45:16.080]  know they've done this stuff before hey by the way he wasn't a psychiatric care
[45:16.080 --> 45:20.280]  they would send Navy security personnel is what the neighbors one guy was a
[45:20.280 --> 45:23.840]  Navy vet said they like Navy security personnel they would grab him just like
[45:23.840 --> 45:29.320]  the unabomber was MK ultra now some of these people are schizophrenics not all
[45:29.320 --> 45:35.680]  of them but but but but the vast majority but there are real mind control
[45:35.680 --> 45:44.880]  programs Larry Jean Ashbrook yep was it 1998 you're 1999 you pulled up that was
[45:44.880 --> 45:52.360]  the time magazine so so there you go a Buford furrow that shot up the Jewish
[45:52.360 --> 45:59.880]  Children's Center is his his address was an Air Force base and he was under the
[45:59.880 --> 46:05.160]  psychiatric care of the Air Force commander at the base who happened to
[46:05.160 --> 46:12.040]  be a psychiatrist oh guess the former head of the San Antonio an entire base
[46:12.040 --> 46:17.760]  was assigned just to be a psychiatrist at a university and spent hours multiple
[46:17.760 --> 46:23.560]  times weekly with the Batman Patsy shooter who said he was under mind
[46:23.560 --> 46:29.160]  control so these are declassified programs it's now come out the sir hand
[46:29.160 --> 46:32.920]  sir hand was mind-controlled and wasn't the shooter and was on drugs like
[46:32.920 --> 46:38.880]  Halcyon so my point is is that we're in a lot of trouble and we've got a guest in
[46:38.880 --> 46:43.000]  here in the third hour who's a medical doctor who's written a book about how
[46:43.000 --> 46:50.640]  they can also use satellites now to mess with people and and again I saw the
[46:50.640 --> 46:57.200]  Baltimore Sun article back in 1998 because I read it on air like 20 times I
[46:57.200 --> 47:01.240]  was mailed the actual paper by a listener looked at it online found it
[47:01.240 --> 47:05.880]  couldn't believe it DARPA admitting they're putting out waves in test it was
[47:05.880 --> 47:10.840]  in the Baltimore area to calm you and test making everyone happy then I was
[47:10.840 --> 47:15.600]  led into the psychology department at UT into restricted areas I shouldn't even
[47:15.600 --> 47:20.200]  say that now the way they grab people but I was allowed into restricted areas
[47:20.200 --> 47:24.280]  mainly non-restricted but oops oh you're not supposed to be in there oh don't
[47:24.280 --> 47:28.760]  look at this you know screens with monkeys with wires in their brains I
[47:28.760 --> 47:33.240]  was looking at this in Bastrop I was looking at it from downtown Austin look
[47:33.240 --> 47:37.480]  30 miles away at the facility cameras on the monkeys with just TV screens flashing
[47:37.480 --> 47:41.240]  different frequencies to test mind control and then I was brought into
[47:41.240 --> 47:45.880]  other DARPA control areas and it was all how to sexually excite women a whole
[47:45.880 --> 47:50.400]  division and it would say who's funding and on the door and they hook women up
[47:50.400 --> 47:54.040]  to electrodes and then hook things up to their bodies and then and then hit them
[47:54.040 --> 47:57.960]  hit them with the sexual excitement stuff to be able to I mean it's and then
[47:57.960 --> 48:03.440]  I was brought into other areas I was brought into areas where where they
[48:03.440 --> 48:07.760]  can transmit without even touching you sound to your head and again that's all
[48:07.760 --> 48:12.560]  public the point is is that and that I'm not gonna even say who brought me in
[48:12.560 --> 48:14.680]  there
[48:16.880 --> 48:23.080]  that's just unbelievable I mean I was in there twice and then I got contacted by
[48:23.080 --> 48:26.080]  somebody at the monkey farm and they said wow you've really seen the monkey
[48:26.080 --> 48:31.000]  farm nobody gets in there I've seen it via cameras and then they had great apes
[48:31.000 --> 48:35.920]  just absolutely just strap down wires all in their heads and just big TV screens
[48:35.920 --> 48:40.480]  and then after they're done they kill them and it's all practicing all
[48:40.480 --> 48:45.480]  Pentagon run how to hit you and your family and hit you hard and that's why
[48:45.480 --> 48:49.200]  people are zombies that's why they laugh at you that's why they think it's all
[48:49.200 --> 48:55.200]  funny this is the normal crazed response of being under attack is to just be up
[48:55.200 --> 49:00.800]  here getting angry and trying to shake people out of their mind control now
[49:00.800 --> 49:04.600]  all of that said look at these articles confirmed Navy Yard shooter was on
[49:04.600 --> 49:09.880]  anti-depressant the Washington Post confirmed that Paul Watson's article
[49:09.880 --> 49:15.200]  breaks it down yeah and then continuing here it turns out that he had
[49:15.200 --> 49:21.160]  carved on his gun this is my ELF weapon and you could say was a schizophrenic
[49:21.160 --> 49:24.640]  but here's where it enters the realm that it looks like mind control from the
[49:24.640 --> 49:30.360]  past cases he had a top secret security clearance was able to get in and I
[49:30.360 --> 49:34.760]  haven't even reported this yet the BBC reported the SWAT team commander went
[49:34.760 --> 49:39.800]  public they were ordered to stand down they were there five minutes after and
[49:39.800 --> 49:44.040]  could have killed him they were to stand down let him kill more people the SWAT
[49:44.040 --> 49:47.200]  team was ordered to stand down he was given a top secret security clearance
[49:47.200 --> 49:50.360]  even though police were constantly getting called when he begged them and
[49:50.360 --> 49:55.320]  said the Navy is mind-controlling me with ELF I work with the Marines in ELF
[49:55.320 --> 49:58.960]  and folks it turns out he worked in classified weapon systems and that's
[49:58.960 --> 50:02.240]  who they always use as a patsy is a Lee Harvey Oswald that was in the Marines
[50:02.240 --> 50:06.360]  as well they will use somebody in their group and they'll take them out of the
[50:06.360 --> 50:09.480]  military and say you've been dishonorably discharged for shooting at your
[50:09.480 --> 50:14.120]  neighbor but we've got a job for you and they I'm calling you it now just moved
[50:14.120 --> 50:18.840]  into mind control zone before I said probably just going you know postal
[50:18.840 --> 50:23.200]  and unless we see a drill unless we and they had a drill by the way days before
[50:23.200 --> 50:28.240]  unless we see a stand down unless we see connections to mind control and now the
[50:28.240 --> 50:34.680]  guy it appears was under mind control unbelievable there's the BBC Navy Yard
[50:34.680 --> 50:40.840]  SWAT team stood down at mass shooting scene ordered to stand down for 45
[50:40.840 --> 50:48.160]  minutes ordered to stand down ordered the day after Obama watches his new
[50:48.160 --> 50:52.880]  gun control push and wants to distract off everything else this was probably a
[50:52.880 --> 51:01.480]  set up this was probably a set up and not racially motivated

[54:17.920 --> 54:25.240]  intel hub reported on it he had carved on there that this weapon is my e l
[54:25.240 --> 54:30.200]  f weapon and see you could say that Aaron Alexis was a schizophrenic or that
[54:30.200 --> 54:35.080]  the psychotropic drugs they put him on made him go artificially temporarily
[54:35.080 --> 54:40.360]  insane but the police continued to come as he said the government was after him
[54:40.360 --> 54:44.120]  and did nothing and his security clearance was not withdrawn he was given
[54:44.120 --> 54:47.240]  a security clearance despite a dishonorable discharge looks you can't
[54:47.240 --> 54:50.720]  get one of those high-level security classes if you have bad credit so they
[54:50.720 --> 54:55.400]  wanted him to have that security clearance he was allowed in none of it makes
[54:55.400 --> 55:01.640]  sense there was the SWAT team was ordered to stand down Julie Wilson wrote

[55:05.240 --> 55:18.840]  BBC from the BBC and so that's what's happening so if he thought the government
[55:18.840 --> 55:22.440]  was after him with e l f waves and he was a regular guy okay maybe he's
[55:22.440 --> 55:27.760]  schizophrenic but he's allowed in he's protected the police keep coming as he
[55:27.760 --> 55:31.520]  says the government's after him they never withdraw his clearance he's able
[55:31.520 --> 55:36.960]  to get in the SWAT teams ordered to stand down it's right on time for a
[55:36.960 --> 55:41.960]  political diversion I've been predicting a mass shooting ladies and gentlemen
[55:41.960 --> 55:45.960]  bare minimum they knew he was a ticking time bomb and let him do this and then
[55:45.960 --> 55:50.920]  ordered the SWAT team that was a mile and a half away at the Capitol whose job
[55:50.920 --> 55:57.840]  it is to respond who showed up five minutes after 911 was called incredible
[55:57.840 --> 56:03.360]  response time bam four man's you know super SWAT team you know command former
[56:03.360 --> 56:07.640]  commandos that are meant to protect Congress ready to go in and kill
[56:07.640 --> 56:15.160]  hostage takers ready to go in as a as a death squad team to take out just turn
[56:15.160 --> 56:19.280]  and burn not sit around they show up and they're told by the base command you
[56:19.280 --> 56:26.040]  stand down homeland security orders you stand down for 45 minutes and they
[56:26.040 --> 56:30.240]  said they've never heard of that never seen that it violated their default
[56:30.240 --> 56:39.800]  position you can bet your bottom dollar ladies and gentlemen you can bet your
[56:39.800 --> 56:46.400]  bottom dollar this is fishy something has rotten in the state of Virginia there
[56:46.400 --> 56:51.840]  in DC on the Potomac there in the District of Criminals Mordor on the
[56:51.840 --> 56:59.260]  Potomac as it's known this is hard core and again I wanted to say oh go and
[56:59.260 --> 57:02.540]  post soul might have been a racist thing some of the evidence but no no this
[57:02.540 --> 57:11.600]  is unbelievable this is another sir hand sir hand Tim McVeigh Lee Harvey Oswald
[57:11.600 --> 57:15.800]  there is a mind control program this guy it turns out was in some type of
[57:15.800 --> 57:20.640]  advanced electronic weapons for the Marines in fact that's in the news there's
[57:20.640 --> 57:26.080]  like a little advanced electronic weapons for the Marines and it wasn't
[57:26.080 --> 57:29.440]  why they admit it wasn't radar jamming it wasn't that kind of electronic weapon
[57:29.440 --> 57:33.240]  it was some electronic weapons I remember seeing on the news he was in
[57:33.240 --> 57:37.960]  advanced secret electronic weapons and then he said maybe he was schizophrenic
[57:37.960 --> 57:40.120]  and that that tripped him off for something and they thought they were
[57:40.120 --> 57:45.000]  after him I mean that could be it too but then they stand down the police keep
[57:45.000 --> 57:48.120]  coming and he doesn't lose his security clearance he gets in gets I mean the
[57:48.120 --> 57:53.720]  timing oh boy I can't believe it and again the

[01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:12.200]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:19.720]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:41.760]  Alex Jones well if you just joined us ladies and gentlemen I want to thank you
[01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:51.680]  for tuning in today it is Thursday the 19th day of September 2013 and I'm your
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:56.240]  host Alex Jones and we've covered a fraction of the news so far if you just
[01:00:56.240 --> 01:01:01.120]  joined us a QE unlimited all the top economists are on record got a raft of
[01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:06.640]  news articles and news video clips where they admit that QE unlimited has gutted
[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:11.800]  the U.S. economy and that we're basically on a sugar high from inflationary
[01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:17.880]  systems that are now beginning to come home but with a depression on top of it
[01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:23.840]  a a a a depression in the real economy a shrinking economy with inflation over
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:27.400]  the top that's done on purpose try to hide the inflation and this is done
[01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:30.480]  because the money can be used by the establishment to buy up
[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:37.280]  infrastructure in a paramilitary economic power grab while impoverishing us
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:42.000]  and the public is now discovering the dastardly nature of this and I've got a
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.920]  bunch of articles where economists say exactly what I just said because it's
[01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:55.080]  the truth and the full import of how dastardly and truly hyper hyper wicked
[01:01:55.080 --> 01:02:01.920]  all of this is is now coming out and when the mainstream media starts telling
[01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:05.360]  you get ready for an implosion next year that means they're gonna hold this
[01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:09.000]  hostage again with another implosion and get even more trillions in bailouts
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:18.480]  to further destroy the economy and it is just really sick it's really sick to
[01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:24.000]  watch this happening to all of us and to watch this happening to all of our
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:30.720]  families and to watch the stroke the slow strangulation by the globalist
[01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:35.680]  tourniquet they've got wrapped around our neck all they smile in our face
[01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:39.560]  telling us how much they love us you're kissing us while they strangle us and I
[01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:43.560]  personally want them off of us I mean if we just woke up at their scum that
[01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:46.920]  their enemies that their trash they have it out for us they're bad they lie
[01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:51.280]  incessantly if we ever just did that it'd be over for them very very quickly I
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:54.400]  want to hear from you about what you think is going to happen in the economy
[01:02:54.400 --> 01:03:00.040]  because I hope the stars are not aligning for a accelerated collapse we've
[01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:05.480]  been an incremental collapse forever but I know this it's better to expose these
[01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:11.080]  people now so that everyone knows they're the authors of what's coming
[01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:14.560]  because they've already set the fire set the fire that's going to burn down the
[01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:17.960]  house the question is will the house completely collapse and the question is
[01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:23.520]  will we be able to use their crimes against them instead of them posing as
[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:26.560]  saviors because here's the deal if we don't get the word out about these
[01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:33.320]  scumbags these these these these larcenous arch vandals of civilization
[01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:39.680]  if we do not expose these arch control freaks these arch demon crats
[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:44.960]  kleptocrats then they are going to pose as the saviors see they create crisis
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:49.480]  offer the solution crisis gets worse they create a bigger crisis offer the
[01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:53.360]  solution it gets worse they offer more solution more power more power more
[01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:57.520]  power more power more power more power more power until they totally take over
[01:03:57.520 --> 01:04:01.840]  the civilization until they totally take over the society I want to hear from
[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:05.960]  first-time callers what you think about this economy and what you're doing to
[01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:08.760]  wake people up about the fact that America is occupied by the globalist

[01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:51.160]  depressants are known to cause psychotic breaks mass murder increase suicide
[01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:56.200]  their suicide pills to make you not commit suicide turns out that he had
[01:09:56.200 --> 01:10:05.440]  carved on his shotgun this is my ELF weapon and of course ELF weapons have
[01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:10.200]  been developed for use against populations and he reportedly was
[01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:14.360]  working in advanced secret weapons systems with the Marines and it kept
[01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:21.960]  calling the police saying they were attacking him but he kept his top secret
[01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:26.440]  security clearance was able to sneak into the base or get through with the
[01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:31.480]  cards get the weapons inside even though the base was disarmed the Marines
[01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:36.800]  didn't even have bullets for their weapons and when the washington dc
[01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:45.160]  special federal SWAT team showed up five minutes after 911 was called no one
[01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:48.720]  was called they they got dressed loaded on their truck drove them all in a half
[01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:52.800]  from the capital they were there five minutes after and they were told
[01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:58.800]  stand down when they're designed to go in and take out an active shooter just
[01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:02.360]  like that the Marines were not allowed to get into the armory and load their
[01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:06.760]  weapons a stand down was ordered to get maximum deaths and I guess for whoever
[01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:11.600]  did it so they could get out now folks they stage sir hand sir hand and RFK
[01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:16.840]  that's now been declassified there was a CIA operation can look it up the CIA was
[01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:19.760]  there on the scene he didn't even shoot him his arm was held down but he was
[01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:22.880]  drugged with amnesiac so he didn't know he did it or not that's all come out
[01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:26.960]  woman in the polka dot dress Tim McVeigh was set up Lee Harvey Oswald was a
[01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:32.280]  Marine that they set up there are Theodore Kaczynski the unabomber was in
[01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:37.080]  an MK ultra program that was declassified in the late 1990s source LA times I'm not
[01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:40.920]  kidding look it up look it up so they've done over and over again but I'm like oh
[01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:45.120]  this might just be somebody going postal who knows the day after Obama
[01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:50.000]  announced he's going after guns Sunday then it happens on Monday and now ladies
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:55.760]  and gentlemen he keeps his security clearance you lose that if you have bad
[01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:59.360]  credit you'll use it sometimes if you're in a bad divorce you'll you'll lose it
[01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:02.600]  for anything unless they don't want you to lose it this guy whether he was start
[01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:08.480]  raving mad or what was allowed shooting through walls shooting people's tires out
[01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:14.440]  to keep going in at the Marine base inside the Navy base he went through two
[01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:21.720]  levels of security in a high-security top-secret weapon system and then all
[01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:27.000]  this happens and then the SWAT team was ordered to stand down that's BBC the SWAT
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:30.760]  team said we've never gone public like this but this is incredible our default
[01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:34.920]  is to go in we've never been told to stand down more people were killed in
[01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:38.160]  blood to death while this happened they made a stand down for 45 additional
[01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:45.920]  minutes this is unprecedented in fact Julie Wilson wrote the article last
[01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:49.680]  night and if you link through it goes to the BBC report we should have that
[01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:55.480]  repost to the front page I mean this is such a big deal such a big deal and then
[01:12:55.480 --> 01:13:00.960]  of course he was on the psychotropic's ladies and gentlemen so this is the type
[01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:03.880]  of stuff that we're dealing with by the way speaking of pills here is the
[01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:10.720]  Huffington Post a pill that tracks your health the reality of the quantified
[01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:14.760]  self-movement and now all the pills coming out are gonna have little RFID
[01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:18.280]  chips in them that you've got to swallow and then be tracked by the doctor we
[01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:22.600]  first reported this three years ago posted people's articles about it and
[01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:26.840]  actually got threatened by manufacturers threatening to sue us if we didn't take
[01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:30.520]  it down because it was inaccurate because they weren't ready yet for the to
[01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:34.800]  hear all the pills are gonna have chips in them now it's like oh yeah all gonna
[01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:40.800]  have chips in it by the way we did not take the story down we just added more
[01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:43.440]  of the story okay well look it's admitted here it's admitted there but
[01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:46.400]  they've told us it isn't accurate I mean this is the type of garbage that's
[01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:50.520]  going on ladies and gentlemen now I'm gonna get to this after I take your
[01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:55.160]  phone calls government promises to stop lying because of the drudge report
[01:13:55.160 --> 01:14:01.680]  spotlight remember this article by a Don Salazar and yours truly from back in
[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:09.800]  July 28th of this year it's now the 19th of September 2013 and it's a Pentagon
[01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:13.600]  video of them admitting they lie to us admitting they're involved in Psyops but
[01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:22.200]  promising to increase the Psyop to be our friend so the Psyop is we're going to
[01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:25.600]  launch a Psyop in America this is a week after they got rid of the federal law
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:29.120]  saying you couldn't engage in domestic propaganda and deception of course they've
[01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:34.240]  always been doing it but now they're just going full bore with elephant guns
[01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:38.680]  against us and then the poor Psyop officers get up the lower level ones
[01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:42.440]  and start crying saying good I don't want to lie anymore and the other Psyop
[01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:47.160]  people look all freaked out and he's like well we don't lie except when we
[01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:51.840]  have to I mean because they've got a mutiny on their hands folks okay they
[01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:56.120]  don't like lying overseas much less the best Psyop is the truth they're pushing
[01:14:56.120 --> 01:15:00.560]  lies folks that speaking of stops you kill Obama again who gets the Bravo
[01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:06.360]  Sierra Award of all time the baloney award we should have like it red carpet
[01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:11.160]  event every year with the baloney awards and just he said that raising the
[01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:16.360]  debt limit again is actually good for the country we're gonna go back to that
[01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:20.880]  in a moment but I want to go back to this drudge article this article about
[01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:24.360]  drudge because they they use drudges the archetypal example of we're tired of
[01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:28.600]  you know the citizen media controlling it and they see him as the head and they
[01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:32.760]  say this as the real media not the state run and he says we're now going to
[01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:39.200]  engage all non-state-run media all know you know CNN Fox they all work with us
[01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:44.120]  we're now going to engage that means payoffs that means money that's on record

[01:24:54.680 --> 01:25:03.040]  I was with Dave Mustaine and Willie Nelson at dinner that was amazing but
[01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:05.920]  I don't like Willie Nelson because he's a famous person I like him because I like
[01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:11.200]  his music and he's such an interesting icon a living legend you know I think
[01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:14.520]  about all the amazing things in our society all the great things about our
[01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:19.760]  culture and the evil hides behind that and I think about how the Nazis learned
[01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:24.440]  from the Soviets was the Bolsheviks before that who by the 20s would put
[01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:36.360]  fluoride in hide levels in the water to make people docile and I was thinking
[01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:39.720]  about that and how it's in Pulitzer prize winning books about the Nuremberg
[01:25:39.720 --> 01:25:44.240]  trials and they went oh you put stuff in the water to make people submit and they
[01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:48.680]  ran right back after 46 and the Nuremberg trials and put it in our water
[01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:54.600]  there should be huge investigations people should be arrested the White
[01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:58.560]  House science are writes books about how they did it to us and I just think
[01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:02.680]  about how all this other news doesn't even matter they've been hitting us with
[01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:10.520]  chemical weapons for 60 plus years in this country and they write books bragging

[01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:33.800]  top of it and then it's not calcium fluoride that you need some of it's
[01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:38.200]  hydrofluorosalic acid and I didn't mean to go off on a jag about that it just

[01:33:43.080 --> 01:33:46.880]  you know I get up here and I talk about a scientific worldwide dictatorship
[01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:50.680]  jacking our food our water our air manipulating our atmosphere that's all
[01:33:50.680 --> 01:33:57.240]  on record and it sounds crazy if I told you Hitler planned similar things once
[01:33:57.240 --> 01:34:01.000]  he took over the planet the Nazis openly wrote that that's where soft kill
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.920]  comes from that if people figure out we're trying to come kill them they
[01:34:03.920 --> 01:34:08.440]  resist but if we take over and then claim we're taking care of them on the model
[01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:12.840]  of the American Indians Hitler actually modeled his camps this is this is on
[01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:17.880]  record by the way hundreds of books have been written on this subject on the
[01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:21.440]  system that was used against Native Americans to put you on a quote
[01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:26.480]  reservation we won't kill you if you go to a reservation then they slowly turn
[01:34:26.480 --> 01:34:31.520]  the food off turn the resources off put criminals in charge and then kill or
[01:34:31.520 --> 01:34:36.000]  imprison anybody that doesn't submit you got to give somebody an out they've
[01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:40.840]  learned oh we're gonna implement face scanning to buy and sell them in five
[01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:45.080]  years we're just gonna trial test it now oh well that's okay they've learned if
[01:34:45.080 --> 01:34:48.200]  you don't have an immediate thing to face that's why when we were gonna
[01:34:48.200 --> 01:34:51.520]  protest the naked body scanners a few years ago and at the national opt-out
[01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:55.560]  day they just stopped body scanning for a few weeks they won't ever let you have
[01:34:55.560 --> 01:35:00.800]  a fight they attack when they want and then when you're mobilized to fight they
[01:35:00.800 --> 01:35:04.640]  pull back because they know you'll have victories and then that will boost morale
[01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:09.920]  it's all psychological warfare but I'm here to tell you folks you can learn
[01:35:09.920 --> 01:35:14.680]  about the enemy's operations and then we could smash these people to hell where
[01:35:14.680 --> 01:35:21.320]  they came from and that's all I want I mean I get so upset people say what why
[01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:24.880]  are you so successful because people at a gut level know I'm telling the truth
[01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:28.440]  and they could see the evidence we put out and they know I want to survive just
[01:35:28.440 --> 01:35:31.760]  like you do and I want to thrive and I don't want to be a slave and I don't want
[01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:35.680]  to be manipulated and I don't like these people that believe they're elite
[01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:39.120]  because they're ruthless running our lives they're actually degenerate
[01:35:39.120 --> 01:35:47.000]  cancer is not elite even though it can reprogram the body and take over with
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:53.720]  its immortal cell line that's what it's called cells that don't die if it had a
[01:35:53.720 --> 01:35:56.880]  consciousness it would be the the Rockefellers the Rothschilds the
[01:35:56.880 --> 01:36:00.840]  globalists oh I can take over nothing can stop me no one can stand in my way
[01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:04.680]  but you're unnatural you're bad they're like well we'll be God we're gonna merge
[01:36:04.680 --> 01:36:08.440]  with machines that's in the news wired magazine Google comes out and says we're
[01:36:08.440 --> 01:36:13.720]  gonna let you live forever now adopt all the technocracy take it all let us
[01:36:13.720 --> 01:36:18.880]  track you it's gonna empower you if it was done slowly if people can make
[01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:23.200]  choices to opt in perhaps some good things will be developed out of it I'm
[01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:27.360]  not against technology but ladies and gentlemen from the start this has been
[01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:33.640]  formed in Satan's womb this has been formed in the laboratories of the New
[01:36:33.640 --> 01:36:38.480]  World Order every piece of tech we're given is twisted and evil to manipulate
[01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:45.280]  and control us they are phasing in our destruction right now and I want to beg
[01:36:45.280 --> 01:36:51.080]  all of you I want to beg all of you if you're a new listener woman this is far
[01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:56.760]  out yes reality is far out and I want to invite you to check out everything I've
[01:36:56.760 --> 01:37:02.120]  claimed you're gonna find out it's far worse than what I'm saying you know the
[01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:09.200]  movie The Matrix that is from the 1970s that's not that's not fiction from the
[01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:13.680]  Pentagon's perspective they believe that humans that are allowed to live in the
[01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:18.800]  new utopia they're gonna build are going to be in tanks sensory deprivation
[01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:23.760]  tanks with wires hooked into our brains and that we will be part of a hive of
[01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:27.760]  mind that's actually in my book sent to tyranny the Pentagon documents got
[01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:35.920]  declassified in 2000 by the Federation of Scientist and then the Pentagon
[01:37:35.920 --> 01:37:42.400]  requested it be reclassified now their plan for your safety is that you be
[01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:46.000]  brought up in a tank
[01:37:48.840 --> 01:37:55.200]  you understand me now these psychopaths are trying to do this and right now

[01:38:09.240 --> 01:38:14.200]  then oh it's super cool you've got ports in your head a lesium oh you want the
[01:38:14.200 --> 01:38:18.880]  technology that's what that whole movie is about selling you on that all of this
[01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:23.040]  till you give up your humanity and yes ladies and gentlemen you could probably
[01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:28.920]  wire-head information and learn how you know French in in ten seconds but the
[01:38:28.920 --> 01:38:34.600]  point is is that they're gonna hack your brain the Pentagon paper the brain has
[01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:37.320]  no firewall
[01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:50.320]  look it up Colonel Alexander silent weapons for quiet wars the quiet war on
[01:38:50.320 --> 01:39:06.960]  humanity the forever war that is so sophisticated so diabolical but we are
[01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:10.600]  animated by the spirit of liberty they are animated by the spirit of total
[01:39:10.600 --> 01:39:20.880]  control total anti-free will they are the galactic and subatomic enemy of all
[01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:23.040]  life
[01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:32.440]  they are the universal enemy of the life force the universal enemy of the the
[01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:46.160]  regenerative wheel of life they are space cancer the globalist tell us that
[01:39:46.160 --> 01:39:52.480]  we're a plague no they are the plague let's go to your phone calls as promised
[01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:57.400]  let's go ahead and talk to Joseph in South Carolina you're on the air go ahead
[01:39:57.400 --> 01:40:03.160]  good morning Alex I'm a first-time caller a long-time listener and this is
[01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:08.120]  kind of like right out of the movie they would have it in it yep Hollywood's
[01:40:08.120 --> 01:40:14.120]  telling us aren't they it is I've been you said earlier you wanted us to call in
[01:40:14.120 --> 01:40:18.440]  first-time callers and tell how we're spreading the word and I'll make some
[01:40:18.440 --> 01:40:24.200]  ball points I'm a little nervous so I found you about three years ago when
[01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:28.760]  the golf ball still happened through Lindsay Williams and I've been listening
[01:40:28.760 --> 01:40:34.560]  to your show support me show ever since and I've watched just about every film
[01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:39.800]  that you have on your website and I like to present those to people and tell
[01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:45.800]  them to go along into my account I tell people about the architects and
[01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:52.840]  engineers but not 11 truthers I send people to go and watch documentaries
[01:40:52.840 --> 01:40:58.680]  about the man who killed Kennedy it is so obvious with all of us coming into
[01:40:58.680 --> 01:41:06.040]  into play that there is just something of epic proportion happening in this
[01:41:06.040 --> 01:41:12.640]  nation and I did want to tell people to go and watch after the tribulation with
[01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:18.240]  Pastor Stephen Anderson I thought that was a great documentary with debunking
[01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:27.600]  the pre-trib rapture and and promoting laziness in the church but the question
[01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:34.240]  I have for you is a friend of mine sent me an email recently and it basically
[01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:39.600]  said I don't know in the audience and out of it but it was talking about this
[01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:45.600]  coronavirus epidemic that's going to be happening in region 30 which is
[01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:51.520]  West Virginia Virginia Washington DC and all these troops being sent vaccines and
[01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:57.200]  all this is there any truth to that at all I've told my reporters that I want
[01:41:57.200 --> 01:42:05.160]  them every day one of my five or six people to do a report on the FEMA
[01:42:05.160 --> 01:42:11.200]  region three drill that starts November 1st and runs for over a month and
[01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:15.280]  there's other overlapping drills there is a drill with riot police to practice the
[01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:19.400]  power going off and to basically establish federal martial law but then
[01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:23.160]  when we've posted New York Times articles about it we've covered it some
[01:42:23.160 --> 01:42:27.200]  but the public it's all just a rumor so it gets wilder and wilder the
[01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:31.200]  conspiracy is they're practicing federal takeover and in their own training
[01:42:31.200 --> 01:42:34.120]  manuals they say gun owners and libertarians and conservatives and
[01:42:34.120 --> 01:42:38.000]  veterans are the enemy and George Washington's bad I mean that's public
[01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:42.840]  in the official Army training manuals that we've gotten from judicial watch
[01:42:42.840 --> 01:42:50.240]  and that has been national news so there's I mean FEMA regions are real the
[01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:55.480]  emergency centers establishment act is real Rex 84 operation garden plot
[01:42:55.480 --> 01:43:00.080]  cable splicer that's a Rex 84 all that's on record and everybody just goes
[01:43:00.080 --> 01:43:06.040]  FEMA camp FEMA camp you know and Glenn Bet goes there are no FEMA camps and I'm
[01:43:06.040 --> 01:43:08.840]  not attacking him but that's just what he well of course it's not called a FEMA
[01:43:08.840 --> 01:43:11.920]  camp it's called an emergency centers establishment act continuity of
[01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:18.560]  government COG emergency response collapse program I mean they've got a
[01:43:18.560 --> 01:43:22.000]  whole bunch of them and it's all there and they admit under the clergy response
[01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:25.960]  teams and in regard and all of it they're going to arrest hundreds of
[01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:31.360]  thousands of people the military's been trained in special units to go out and
[01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:36.120]  kill certain people and I'll guarantee you I'm on a kill list but that doesn't
[01:43:36.120 --> 01:43:40.280]  intimidate me listen they strike me down that's just a canary in the coal mine
[01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:43.920]  for everybody else people aren't just gonna wait the second and third and
[01:43:43.920 --> 01:43:48.040]  fourth wave when the death squads go out Alexander Solzhenitsa taught us what
[01:43:48.040 --> 01:43:58.120]  to do we already have the drop on the enemy we have been tracking their
[01:43:58.120 --> 01:44:02.120]  operations for decades and warning everyone and our people are everywhere
[01:44:02.120 --> 01:44:05.520]  now and when the enemy thinks they're gonna launch those type of attacks I
[01:44:05.520 --> 01:44:10.320]  tell them go ahead and do it go ahead in New Cassidy and blame it on us go ahead
[01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:14.360]  because that's the beginning of the end of these people the sooner they launch
[01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:18.120]  their war the better because we've got them right where we want them sorry sir
[01:44:18.120 --> 01:44:23.480]  go ahead and so and then there's Lindsey Lindsey Graham
[01:44:23.480 --> 01:44:27.520]  blabbing his mouth saying that Charleston Harbor could be hit by a
[01:44:27.520 --> 01:44:34.400]  nuclear weapon and how does he know this well they think we're idiots and the
[01:44:34.400 --> 01:44:37.200]  people they're targeting are completely in trance states I mean
[01:44:37.200 --> 01:44:41.360]  their medically the general public is now in a lower brainwave I mean that's
[01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:46.680]  admitted in Harvard studies MIT Stanford BBC headlines the public is in a lower
[01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:51.000]  brainwave TV watchers are trained that's why you talk to somebody even
[01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:54.800]  they're smart they just keep looking at you because they don't do things they
[01:44:54.800 --> 01:45:00.160]  just they just watch and and so you tell them this and they just they have learned
[01:45:00.160 --> 01:45:05.040]  helplessness God bless you I appreciate your call I actually hope cooler minds
[01:45:05.040 --> 01:45:08.640]  prevail and the globalists back off the government's full of good people so are
[01:45:08.640 --> 01:45:14.040]  corporations it's only very high-level technocrats that are running this and
[01:45:14.040 --> 01:45:19.760]  via false templates false stories it's in the Washington Post today in the
[01:45:19.760 --> 01:45:22.840]  national security section that the entire military structure not just the
[01:45:22.840 --> 01:45:28.400]  rank-and-file the command structure told Obama and the neocons not just know
[01:45:28.400 --> 01:45:33.720]  but absolutely not we are sick of funding al-Qaeda they've been training them for
[01:45:33.720 --> 01:45:37.520]  years they're very upset about it you what you're doing is immoral and you know
[01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:40.600]  the rebels launched a chemical attack that's all coming out army report got
[01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:44.160]  leaked why do you think the army leaked it on purpose didn't get any national
[01:45:44.160 --> 01:45:49.640]  news but it got news in the real media and they are now freaking out in the
[01:45:49.640 --> 01:45:53.600]  power structure and I'm telling you if they do something bigger to try to get
[01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:57.160]  the military to follow orders it's gonna backfire down the road maybe not
[01:45:57.160 --> 01:46:02.800]  right I'm right away maybe not immediately but I can see all the
[01:46:02.800 --> 01:46:06.880]  converging lines here and I'm really I'm proud of humanity and I'm proud of
[01:46:06.880 --> 01:46:10.720]  the military who's really waking up there they're the most awake grip the
[01:46:10.720 --> 01:46:13.120]  globalists know that they know the military is their main enemy because
[01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:16.800]  they've been the sword they've used to take over the planet through lies and
[01:46:16.800 --> 01:46:21.120]  now that sword is conscious and it wants to go at the new world order and the new
[01:46:21.120 --> 01:46:25.880]  world order is preparing it for a purge that's why that's it all the FBI
[01:46:25.880 --> 01:46:29.400]  everybody's trained your enemy will be the veterans this colonel this general
[01:46:29.400 --> 01:46:34.560]  this officer that's who would lead this talk show host this author I mean and
[01:46:34.560 --> 01:46:39.840]  they've got kill list ladies and gentlemen will good luck executing that
[01:46:42.200 --> 01:46:47.960]  oh man who I appreciate your call Andrew and Georgia you're on the air
[01:46:47.960 --> 01:46:53.120]  thanks for calling in I'm alive man this is a I'm in the middle of an
[01:46:53.120 --> 01:46:57.920]  incredible epic so are you calling in from Albany Georgia I'm a first-time
[01:46:57.920 --> 01:47:03.160]  caller and I am a descendant of Edward relic I believe it was a young sign of
[01:47:03.160 --> 01:47:06.960]  the declaration so I have that flame in my blood you're a terrorist you're a
[01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:11.240]  terrorist you're a bad man yeah yeah well what I want to talk to you about a
[01:47:11.240 --> 01:47:17.000]  day out Alex is the Federal Reserve and the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 and the
[01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:21.120]  fact that without war our economy would have collapsed long ago and without a
[01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:26.960]  spread of central banking systems so Alex the my question is if the Federal
[01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:30.880]  Reserve is overthrown which it has to be done how will the people that have
[01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:34.840]  invested their life savings be recompensated for their life's work
[01:47:34.840 --> 01:47:37.840]  without going to another government security systems yeah that's a great
[01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:42.640]  point it's like cancer of the heart it's very rare but sometimes they can't cut
[01:47:42.640 --> 01:47:46.240]  it out because it's part of the heart it's so much of the heart they can't
[01:47:46.240 --> 01:47:50.360]  reconstruct it and so the globalists are smart they get everybody dependent get
[01:47:50.360 --> 01:47:54.280]  everybody's pension funds at retirement investments in their fraud then they
[01:47:54.280 --> 01:47:58.240]  endanger it and bankrupt it and then go okay give us total power if you ever
[01:47:58.240 --> 01:48:03.600]  want to see your retirement money and so now we're so dependent as Ron Paul has
[01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:10.360]  said so deep into this into the peasant class that that it would take a hundred
[01:48:10.360 --> 01:48:16.120]  years some estimates to get out of this okay but really a few decades could
[01:48:16.120 --> 01:48:19.760]  probably do it if you stopped all the empires if you pulled out of the wars
[01:48:19.760 --> 01:48:23.320]  if you actually sort of trying to really educate people instead of dumb them
[01:48:23.320 --> 01:48:28.800]  down if you had zero percent government issued bonds to build infrastructure
[01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:32.880]  instead of just having it be digits in ones so they technically have a debt
[01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:36.760]  we're under there's a lot of things you could do look the Federal Reserve you
[01:48:36.760 --> 01:48:39.920]  would say a decade ago our problems and overheating economy they're always
[01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:44.680]  trying to suppress the real economy and only allow growth in their sectors so
[01:48:44.680 --> 01:48:50.680]  if we got this monkey off our back I'm open for a new government run fiat
[01:48:50.680 --> 01:48:56.080]  system like Lincoln had or like JFK wanted to go to or it could be partially
[01:48:56.080 --> 01:49:01.640]  gold-backed or whatever I'm a goldbugs everybody knows but I mean you can take
[01:49:01.640 --> 01:49:05.640]  the power of fiat and use it I mean the globalists have used it to buy off the
[01:49:05.640 --> 01:49:11.080]  planet imagine if we to use all that fiat to build our infrastructure but done
[01:49:11.080 --> 01:49:15.240]  in a more manageable rate so there's a lot of different economic systems we
[01:49:15.240 --> 01:49:19.000]  can debate the point is nothing is worse than the slow death of the Federal
[01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:27.320]  Reserve because this is a succubus attached to us well I set up a Facebook
[01:49:27.320 --> 01:49:31.320]  page so I try to wake everybody up and stuff inside I like the idea of using
[01:49:31.320 --> 01:49:36.280]  their mind control devices cell phones Facebook social media against the global
[01:49:36.280 --> 01:49:42.280]  well that's right even a crazed manner animated by the force of liberty if you
[01:49:42.280 --> 01:49:45.560]  have the brush fire in your mind you're setting in the minds of other people it
[01:49:45.560 --> 01:49:50.000]  is a fire ladies and gentlemen it is a fire to resist these people it is I mean
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.440]  let me tell you right now you think there's only evil in this universe I
[01:49:52.440 --> 01:49:56.640]  know you've got to ask for the fire of liberty you got to ask God I don't care
[01:49:56.640 --> 01:50:00.880]  I have faith I'm committed to fight I'm here to be a warrior against tyranny
[01:50:00.880 --> 01:50:05.360]  energize me I'm telling you folks that's the big secret the churches are hiding
[01:50:05.360 --> 01:50:10.400]  that was the animating spirit in 1776 led by the real churches didn't matter
[01:50:10.400 --> 01:50:15.040]  what was Protestant Catholic across the board against what was happening under
[01:50:15.040 --> 01:50:19.560]  the colonies and it was the black brigades of the preachers of the
[01:50:19.560 --> 01:50:23.680]  priest and that's where it is and you're not gonna find that you're
[01:50:23.680 --> 01:50:30.520]  gonna find little tubby little wimpy psychologist liars you know obviously
[01:50:30.520 --> 01:50:35.240]  atheist probably preachers like Rick Warren you're gonna find little demon
[01:50:35.240 --> 01:50:39.320]  blobs like that in these little mega churches they're all just government
[01:50:39.320 --> 01:50:43.000]  surveillance crids you know when they're to manipulate everyone and keep tabs on
[01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:46.920]  everyone you're not gonna find God there gonna find God staring into the heavens

[02:07:10.960 --> 02:07:17.320]  dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your
[02:07:17.320 --> 02:07:22.480]  psyche from compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing
[02:07:22.480 --> 02:07:26.800]  machine we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our
[02:07:26.800 --> 02:07:30.880]  actions when somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and
[02:07:30.880 --> 02:07:34.400]  testing it out and verifying if they can take total control of your awareness
[02:07:34.400 --> 02:07:37.920]  all of this is happening so fast you need to be ahead of the game how to
[02:07:37.920 --> 02:07:42.280]  engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only
[02:07:42.280 --> 02:07:51.840]  endorse but demand war because there's a war on for your mind get your copy of
[02:07:51.840 --> 02:07:57.120]  state of mind the movie at info wars dot com and remember every order at info
[02:07:57.120 --> 02:08:02.160]  war store dot com receives a free citizen rulebook
[02:08:02.160 --> 02:08:10.000]  for 50 years we've told what to eat what to drink what to wear a Christ sake
[02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:15.600]  Ben don't you understand Americans love television they wean their kids on it
[02:08:15.600 --> 02:08:22.200]  this is they love game shows they love wrestling they love sports violence so
[02:08:22.200 --> 02:08:29.800]  what do we do we give them what they want we're number one Ben that's all the
[02:08:29.800 --> 02:08:34.760]  counts believe me I've been in the business 30 years well I haven't been in
[02:08:34.760 --> 02:08:39.960]  show business as long as you have Killian but I'm a quick learner so I'm
[02:08:39.960 --> 02:08:45.400]  going to give the audience what I think they want we now take you live to the
[02:08:45.400 --> 02:08:51.640]  central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance
[02:08:51.640 --> 02:09:00.080]  well the Naval Yard shooting Patsy from Monday and undoubtedly we can say a
[02:09:00.080 --> 02:09:09.240]  Patsy now Aaron Alexis fits the exact cookie cutter Bill of a MK ultra mind
[02:09:09.240 --> 02:09:13.880]  control individual now he may not have been even been part of the shooting he
[02:09:13.880 --> 02:09:17.360]  may have thought he was part of a drill he may have actually been the shooter we
[02:09:17.360 --> 02:09:23.840]  don't know but we know it has every single ingredient from one end to another
[02:09:23.840 --> 02:09:29.280]  of a staged event you notice I didn't say this day one day two day three we're
[02:09:29.280 --> 02:09:35.840]  now into day four it's pouring out and I'll be honest I don't go yeah it's them
[02:09:35.840 --> 02:09:41.680]  again I'm like oh my gosh they really are evil folks if you have bad credit you
[02:09:41.680 --> 02:09:45.740]  don't get a high-level security clearance he had a top-secret security
[02:09:45.740 --> 02:09:51.240]  clearance working in advanced unorthodox electronic weapons that's come out in
[02:09:51.240 --> 02:09:57.760]  the Associated Press for the Marine Corps at a naval weapons research facility
[02:09:57.760 --> 02:10:04.000]  got nuclear submarines you name it there he worked with the Marine Corps in in
[02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:10.360]  high-tech weapons now we know they've got ELF guns they've got microwave guns
[02:10:10.360 --> 02:10:15.680]  they've got plasma beam guns that's all declassified DARPA said in 1998 in the
[02:10:15.680 --> 02:10:23.600]  Baltimore Sun that very area that in the DC Baltimore Virginia Merrill Beltway
[02:10:23.600 --> 02:10:30.200]  area that they were testing cell towers and by the way we have Lexus nexus I
[02:10:30.200 --> 02:10:34.320]  don't think anyone uses it it's 1998 I covered it on air probably I said ten
[02:10:34.320 --> 02:10:39.520]  times probably 20 times it was a whole DARPA article about we're now testing
[02:10:39.520 --> 02:10:44.560]  the cell towers to put out waves to see if it calms people and cuts back on on
[02:10:44.560 --> 02:10:51.600]  angry drivers and crime and I called DARPA my wife was my producer then she
[02:10:51.600 --> 02:10:56.000]  got guests we called DARPA we called MIT we called the director of the new
[02:10:56.000 --> 02:11:00.520]  projects of DARPA who was at MIT and tried to get the doctor on I mean I made
[02:11:00.520 --> 02:11:03.360]  a big deal out of that article somebody's got to go pull that out where
[02:11:03.360 --> 02:11:07.040]  they're just going and the cell towers you may feel a little different in the
[02:11:07.040 --> 02:11:10.120]  Beltway we're just you know of course they're gonna target the Beltway first
[02:11:10.120 --> 02:11:13.480]  with mine control they they've got declassified tests where they can make
[02:11:13.480 --> 02:11:17.000]  rats start eating a whole bunch or make them start having sex or make them get
[02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:20.520]  really angry and fight with just different types of wavelengths different
[02:11:20.520 --> 02:11:24.720]  types of they admit cell phones with this ultra high frequency microwave
[02:11:24.720 --> 02:11:31.040]  actually raises brainwaves TV lowers them from watching television it gets
[02:11:31.040 --> 02:11:34.200]  very complex by that a lot of scientists a lot of medical doctors Dr. Nick
[02:11:34.200 --> 02:11:40.200]  Begich a scientist on there are thousands of patents from the 50s 60s 70s
[02:11:40.200 --> 02:11:45.320]  80s 90s now they're just classified on this Disney comes out with oh a new toy
[02:11:45.320 --> 02:11:48.400]  where you'll communicate by touching someone and they'll hear it inside their
[02:11:48.400 --> 02:11:57.000]  brain that was patented in 1953 of memory serves 52 so the point here is
[02:11:57.000 --> 02:12:04.360]  under US code title 50 chapter 32 subsection 1520 a paragraph B it says
[02:12:04.360 --> 02:12:07.600]  you're not allowed to do any secret testing on the American people unless
[02:12:07.600 --> 02:12:13.480]  it's for law enforcement or any research purpose so just like they have a new
[02:12:13.480 --> 02:12:16.000]  bill to protect the press it actually gets rid of the First Amendment press
[02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:19.520]  protections unless you're especially government certified by Diane Feinstein
[02:12:19.520 --> 02:12:25.920]  same deal here Patriot acts unpatriotic Obama says hey we've raised the debt
[02:12:25.920 --> 02:12:29.120]  limit that makes us spend less money it doesn't spend more money of course it
[02:12:29.120 --> 02:12:34.120]  spends more money I mean it is just Orwellian the level and if you were
[02:12:34.120 --> 02:12:38.840]  DARPA in the military industrial complex who would you target first DC the
[02:12:38.840 --> 02:12:44.400]  first time we hear them hide it in plain view with I guess mass Stockholm
[02:12:44.400 --> 02:12:48.480]  syndrome induction is what I would call it is to see it in the Baltimore Sun
[02:12:48.480 --> 02:12:54.920]  1998 talking to the DARPA new projects director about how they're testing to
[02:12:54.920 --> 02:12:58.200]  make us happy I mean what's wrong with that I mean what's wrong with that that
[02:12:58.200 --> 02:13:01.480]  I've got Fox News saying we want to put lithium in the water to make you calm
[02:13:01.480 --> 02:13:06.240]  you know fluoride does that I mean see that now that we're exposing them they're
[02:13:06.240 --> 02:13:11.920]  rolling all this out now that said you drive down the road in any big city you
[02:13:11.920 --> 02:13:16.120]  see schizophrenics that think the Sun's following them you see people that they've
[02:13:16.120 --> 02:13:19.560]  got chips in their brains really they probably got a chemical imbalance you
[02:13:19.560 --> 02:13:22.120]  because the brains designed to be looking out for itself you know as a
[02:13:22.120 --> 02:13:25.960]  saber-toothed tiger gonna eat me that starts going haywire you know like a
[02:13:25.960 --> 02:13:29.000]  chihuahua that it thinks everybody's out to get him it thinks the shadow is a
[02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:32.920]  monster humans can do that too and a lot of times it's chemical they learn this
[02:13:32.920 --> 02:13:36.040]  in Eastern Europe Western Europe during the Industrial Revolution people
[02:13:36.040 --> 02:13:39.440]  working around toxic dyes and things they have almost everybody going saying
[02:13:39.440 --> 02:13:43.680]  that's what the term mad as a hatter came from dying that the top hats and
[02:13:43.680 --> 02:13:49.600]  stuff with the mercury dyes so the the a big upswing of mental illness last 200
[02:13:49.600 --> 02:13:53.920]  years is the Industrial Revolution so there is real mental illness going on
[02:13:53.920 --> 02:13:59.960]  but now it's been confirmed that he was put on drugs psychotrobics Washington
[02:13:59.960 --> 02:14:05.480]  Post that articles up on info wars.com it is confirmed he shot an apartment
[02:14:05.480 --> 02:14:08.720]  through the wall it's confirmed he shot out tires with vehicle in the week
[02:14:08.720 --> 02:14:11.640]  before this happened he called the police saying you know the Pentagon's
[02:14:11.640 --> 02:14:15.280]  trying to kill me they're hitting me with microwaves which by the way you're in
[02:14:15.280 --> 02:14:18.160]  the news today they're admitting they have microwaves to control people's minds
[02:14:18.160 --> 02:14:24.800]  in in what is it in a wired magazine so whether it see he could just be
[02:14:24.800 --> 02:14:29.240]  schizophrenic but then he has a top-secret security clearance working in
[02:14:29.240 --> 02:14:32.760]  these type of weapons systems we know that are at that base in that area they
[02:14:32.760 --> 02:14:37.040]  said high-tech unorthodox electronic weapons he says they're messing with
[02:14:37.040 --> 02:14:41.920]  them he's allowed on to the base the he's police come multiple times he says
[02:14:41.920 --> 02:14:44.880]  the government's messing with them you know the base knows this is going on
[02:14:44.880 --> 02:14:49.200]  and here's the coup de gras the the special unit SWAT team to respond to
[02:14:49.200 --> 02:14:53.960]  this stuff was there in five minutes in order to stand down and the Marines were
[02:14:53.960 --> 02:14:58.200]  ordered to stand down and couldn't get in the armory to get bullets for their M16s
[02:14:58.200 --> 02:15:04.160]  and that's BBC let me show you some of these articles Aaron Alexis carved my
[02:15:04.160 --> 02:15:08.920]  ELF weapon on the stock of his shotgun he's working in a secret weapons
[02:15:08.920 --> 02:15:14.960]  laboratory I mean who knows what really have the point is there's a cover up
[02:15:14.960 --> 02:15:20.240]  here okay then we're going to our guest Navy Yard shooting SWAT teams order to
[02:15:20.240 --> 02:15:24.000]  stand down Julie Wilson in force calm linking through to Navy Yard SWAT team
[02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:27.960]  stood down at mass shooting scene and went public saying this has never
[02:15:27.960 --> 02:15:32.160]  happened before we were ordered to stand down this is basically criminal big
[02:15:32.160 --> 02:15:35.920]  enough of the SWAT team to contact the media US media wouldn't publish it
[02:15:35.920 --> 02:15:41.720]  British did okay this went on for 45 minutes more him shooting people
[02:15:41.720 --> 02:15:48.200]  reportedly can you even believe that now ladies and gentlemen this happened at
[02:15:48.200 --> 02:15:51.280]  perfect timing with the gun announcement Obama the day before said I'm
[02:15:51.280 --> 02:15:55.240]  coming after the guns a perfect distraction I said I said I saw a mass
[02:15:55.240 --> 02:15:59.880]  shooting in my political crystal ball seeing everything I see more of this you
[02:15:59.880 --> 02:16:02.520]  have the history of them doing this with Theodore Kaczynski that was mind
[02:16:02.520 --> 02:16:06.600]  control LA Times McVeigh was set up under mind control that high-level
[02:16:06.600 --> 02:16:11.600]  national security clearance Lee Harvey Oswald they set up their own people this
[02:16:11.600 --> 02:16:17.000]  stinks I'd give it 90% that they knew he was going to do it and let him do it and
[02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:20.200]  they were probably behind it okay because I mean again you got somebody
[02:16:20.200 --> 02:16:23.360]  saying the government's controlling me I'm under mind control and the cops don't
[02:16:23.360 --> 02:16:26.720]  take you to the loony bin folks they take veterans the loony bin if they say
[02:16:26.720 --> 02:16:30.480]  at work I hate Obama they come and take your guns and put you in a loony bin
[02:16:30.480 --> 02:16:36.040]  that's on record this guy's police they said four times coming to him flipping
[02:16:36.040 --> 02:16:39.480]  out in hotels running around saying they're after me they're after me he's
[02:16:39.480 --> 02:16:43.320]  allowed to go to work he's a lot I mean that nut folks if you know how mental
[02:16:43.320 --> 02:16:46.360]  health works this is not the case and now they get to say everybody needs to be
[02:16:46.360 --> 02:16:50.920]  psychologically screen see because this guy was able to do this it stinks to high
[02:16:50.920 --> 02:16:55.480]  heaven the motive is there I don't know I thought it was going postal first and
[02:16:55.480 --> 02:17:01.600]  somebody on a SSRI which we now know he was but I'm telling you I don't know
[02:17:01.600 --> 02:17:06.760]  now we have the author of a new breed satellite terrorism in America he's a
[02:17:06.760 --> 02:17:11.560]  medical doctor anesthesiologist also his degree in biology and science from the
[02:17:11.560 --> 02:17:17.080]  University of Texas and he's also again an author satweapons.com and I was
[02:17:17.080 --> 02:17:21.720]  told by dr. Bob Bowman before he died he's been on air about this that they
[02:17:21.720 --> 02:17:25.160]  were working on systems basically a radiation gun that could target and hit
[02:17:25.160 --> 02:17:28.640]  somebody and you die six months later you know you get real sick but not know
[02:17:28.640 --> 02:17:35.120]  what happened and you know basically high-powered nuclear-powered microwaves so
[02:17:35.120 --> 02:17:38.800]  so we know this is going on we're not saying everybody that you know thinks
[02:17:38.800 --> 02:17:42.560]  this is happening it's really happening okay but the point is this stuff
[02:17:42.560 --> 02:17:46.280]  exists and we're going to break or with us for the balance of the hour dr. John
[02:17:46.280 --> 02:17:50.840]  Hall of San Antonio you got like two minutes till we go to break what do you
[02:17:50.840 --> 02:17:54.000]  think knowing what you ran into what your books about with this with your
[02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:57.240]  patients and friends and people and thinking it wasn't true because I've
[02:17:57.240 --> 02:18:02.200]  seen on news in San Antonio and then discovering stuff what is this look to
[02:18:02.200 --> 02:18:07.320]  you with with this constellation of info we've got with this Alexis guy well
[02:18:07.320 --> 02:18:12.000]  you know knowing that the government wants gun control and then seeing some
[02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:16.040]  of the other things that have come out recently like you said you know you can't
[02:18:16.040 --> 02:18:18.600]  discount mental illness you know especially being a physician you've
[02:18:18.600 --> 02:18:23.000]  got to recognize that schizophrenics exist for one he's a little old so just
[02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:26.920]  all the sudden go schizophrenic to bingo yeah typically 34 typically it's like
[02:18:26.920 --> 02:18:31.600]  your teens 18 to 20 yeah yeah typically so acute schizophrenia and somebody at
[02:18:31.600 --> 02:18:35.800]  his age now he worked in a field where he worked with these types of exotic
[02:18:35.800 --> 02:18:40.640]  weapons like on NBC they they mentioned the etching on his shotgun they
[02:18:40.640 --> 02:18:45.240]  mentioned it as cryptic etching that said my ELF weapon well it wasn't cryptic
[02:18:45.240 --> 02:18:49.520]  to him he's worked in this field so he knew exactly what he was being targeted
[02:18:49.520 --> 02:18:53.360]  with the voices he was hearing didn't tell him to go run a muck at the Navy
[02:18:53.360 --> 02:18:58.160]  Yard he went to where he perceived the weapons coming from that's a good point
[02:18:58.160 --> 02:19:01.320]  as a theory they were programming him for a mass shooting so he went to them
[02:19:01.320 --> 02:19:05.960]  exactly and having worked with a lot of these victims that are hearing voices
[02:19:05.960 --> 02:19:10.080]  that are being put into their head not from schizophrenia most of them kind of
[02:19:10.080 --> 02:19:13.040]  have an idea of where it's coming from some of them are wrong because the
[02:19:13.040 --> 02:19:16.360]  technology is meant to foster a wrong belief make you think it's your
[02:19:16.360 --> 02:19:21.000]  relatives or your parents or you know your work when in reality at least from
[02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:24.400]  what we found with counter surveillance in San Antonio it's usually a private
[02:19:24.400 --> 02:19:27.840]  investigative group made up of former federal employees yeah that's why you
[02:19:27.840 --> 02:19:31.000]  been on the news you guys have actually caught people before in the act exactly
[02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:36.360]  wow man I tell you and and so you've got over a million private contractors
[02:19:36.360 --> 02:19:40.360]  operating domestically just in just in psyops they admit there's too many
[02:19:40.360 --> 02:19:44.800]  clearances out there too many clearances and you know looking at mind
[02:19:44.800 --> 02:19:48.040]  control technology they've always contracted it out that it's never done
[02:19:48.040 --> 02:19:53.520]  directly by the CIA not since the 60s absolutely wow we'll be right back with
[02:19:53.520 --> 02:19:57.720]  the doctor this is powerful info he'll have the floor when we return this is key
[02:19:57.720 --> 02:20:02.760]  intel tell your friends and family tune in why does the United States spend the
[02:20:02.760 --> 02:20:06.840]  largest percentage of GDP in the world on health care why do we have the highest
[02:20:06.840 --> 02:20:12.640]  cancer rates on the planet the highest rates of diabetes autism and every other

[02:24:08.040 --> 02:24:14.840]  my friends 15 years ago in Los Angeles and Tokyo I know because we got the
[02:24:14.840 --> 02:24:19.720]  director of the company on it was in the news wash tech they had coke machines
[02:24:19.720 --> 02:24:24.800]  soft drink machines that would beam audio to your middle ear that nobody else
[02:24:24.800 --> 02:24:30.440]  could hear now they have it like out of minority report where you walk by and
[02:24:30.440 --> 02:24:34.400]  because of Facebook the billboard in Times Square this has been out for four
[02:24:34.400 --> 02:24:40.080]  years knows who you are three years face scans and then makes announcements to
[02:24:40.080 --> 02:24:45.640]  your name what you're doing here's wired magazine today transfer a secret
[02:24:45.640 --> 02:24:52.440]  audio message by poking someone with your finger wired magazine and these are
[02:24:52.440 --> 02:24:56.560]  these systems that have been patented since the 50s it's way more way more
[02:24:56.560 --> 02:25:01.720]  advanced and they have digital data transfer over power lines now where they
[02:25:01.720 --> 02:25:05.240]  admit all the new appliances are designed to spy on you the CIA director said so
[02:25:05.240 --> 02:25:09.920]  so this is going on the question is how many people are schizophrenic that
[02:25:09.920 --> 02:25:13.720]  come to you well well get into what you discovered the private investigators
[02:25:13.720 --> 02:25:18.320]  they're using how it's subcontracted and who they're targeting well you know the
[02:25:18.320 --> 02:25:22.240]  girl came to me complaining that she was hearing voices that she was being
[02:25:22.240 --> 02:25:27.600]  followed being targeted knew her well knew the family knew there was no
[02:25:27.600 --> 02:25:31.600]  history of mental illness knew there wasn't a drug problem or alcohol problem
[02:25:31.600 --> 02:25:35.720]  had heard a little bit about this technology before so gave her the
[02:25:35.720 --> 02:25:40.560]  benefit of the doubt and actually spent some money well we audio bugged her
[02:25:40.560 --> 02:25:44.400]  condominium had people you know following her to see if she was being
[02:25:44.400 --> 02:25:49.160]  followed and indeed the people following her including myself were followed to and
[02:25:49.160 --> 02:25:54.360]  from her her condo and to my home it we got the plate numbers of the people
[02:25:54.360 --> 02:25:58.080]  doing the stalking it all came back to a former FBI guy running a private
[02:25:58.080 --> 02:26:03.640]  investigative group so seeing that we couldn't get anything done by the way
[02:26:03.640 --> 02:26:06.800]  you're not just saying this is on the San Antonio TV this is this has been
[02:26:06.800 --> 02:26:09.760]  national news yeah and the books been out since oh six and almost to this
[02:26:09.760 --> 02:26:12.520]  happened prior to oh that's right I mean and now you found the network
[02:26:12.520 --> 02:26:17.160]  nationwide but go ahead but so we go to the police and the police at the time
[02:26:17.160 --> 02:26:20.600]  Texas had different stalking laws as you know our stalking laws have changed if
[02:26:20.600 --> 02:26:23.920]  you notice the same person following you know you can actually get a restraining
[02:26:23.920 --> 02:26:28.280]  order against them at that time you had to show injury no I know because I went
[02:26:28.280 --> 02:26:30.800]  to court over it the guy was threatened to even kill my sister and they wouldn't
[02:26:30.800 --> 02:26:34.000]  do anything I finally got him though you've got yeah you get you at that
[02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:37.280]  time you had to show injury and she had been injured because she had been
[02:26:37.280 --> 02:26:40.880]  actually been drugged and sexually assaulted but with Ro Hipnall she
[02:26:40.880 --> 02:26:45.280]  didn't have any memory of the culprits so we audio bugged her place caught them
[02:26:45.280 --> 02:26:49.280]  breaking into her place caught them putting Ro Hipnall in the water basically
[02:26:49.280 --> 02:26:53.240]  the police said this guy's former FBI he stalks people for a living she doesn't
[02:26:53.240 --> 02:26:56.240]  have any recall of the rape and there's no way we're gonna get a stalking charge
[02:26:56.240 --> 02:27:00.680]  that was why I decided to write the book to basically put it out there that this
[02:27:00.680 --> 02:27:05.080]  technology does exist but but I mean obviously if they've got access to high
[02:27:05.080 --> 02:27:09.360]  level government stuff the question is why are they doing it or is it what's
[02:27:09.360 --> 02:27:13.520]  the point from after the book came out and then now after talking to about five
[02:27:13.520 --> 02:27:18.280]  or six thousand other victims and globally and here it appears to be
[02:27:18.280 --> 02:27:22.200]  experimental you know we both live in Texas as you know guns and taxes won't
[02:27:22.200 --> 02:27:26.480]  control everybody especially in Texas you know you and I can you know we can
[02:27:26.480 --> 02:27:29.920]  you know skin the deer we can run a trot line we can get water out of a well
[02:27:29.920 --> 02:27:33.840]  you know you can live off the land and and not be controlled with taxes
[02:27:33.840 --> 02:27:39.220]  electromagnetic weaponry just as per singer said 15 years ago he could
[02:27:39.220 --> 02:27:42.160]  control every brain on the planet with microwave that's right for those that
[02:27:42.160 --> 02:27:45.200]  don't know tell people about the Pentagon they're public about this yeah
[02:27:45.200 --> 02:27:48.520]  they're very public about it that the it's found been found out that the
[02:27:48.520 --> 02:27:51.880]  brain is very susceptible to elf waves to microwave energy in fact that's the
[02:27:51.880 --> 02:27:56.560]  Pentagon paper the brain has no firewall the brain has no firewall you can put
[02:27:56.560 --> 02:27:59.280]  voices in the head for those of you listening that think that's an
[02:27:59.280 --> 02:28:03.560]  impossibility go to audiospotlight.com you can purchase a unit yourself to put
[02:28:03.560 --> 02:28:07.480]  voices on somebody said that I know Ventura didn't believe it till they got
[02:28:07.480 --> 02:28:11.800]  one and did it he's like what the I mean you know there are several ways to do
[02:28:11.800 --> 02:28:17.400]  that this guy this new shooter he you know he worked in that field the fact
[02:28:17.400 --> 02:28:21.560]  that he put that that as in it as NBC said that cryptic message that they
[02:28:21.560 --> 02:28:26.400]  couldn't understand what he meant by my elf weapon well he understood it that's
[02:28:26.400 --> 02:28:30.720]  why he you know he went to where he perceived the voices as coming from is
[02:28:30.720 --> 02:28:35.920]  why he went there this wasn't voices telling him or subliminally controlling
[02:28:35.920 --> 02:28:39.640]  him to go a muck I don't believe at least based on listen he could have been
[02:28:39.640 --> 02:28:43.040]  schizophrenic except they opened all the doors for him I mean you've got a high
[02:28:43.040 --> 02:28:45.760]  security clearance and you're calling the cops four times and showing up saying
[02:28:45.760 --> 02:28:48.520]  the government's after me you're going to the funny farm your clearance is
[02:28:48.520 --> 02:28:52.520]  yanked well and I mean they definitely and if you remember from the early MK
[02:28:52.520 --> 02:28:57.080]  ultra studies you know the known mentally ill were experimented on more than
[02:28:57.080 --> 02:29:00.960]  the same well and then and then they threw army officers out of windows Olson
[02:29:00.960 --> 02:29:06.200]  and others I mean yeah and I think this is basically a continuation of MK ultra
[02:29:06.200 --> 02:29:11.720]  because you know MK ultra ended with the Rockefeller Commission supposedly but
[02:29:11.720 --> 02:29:14.480]  all that ended was the freedom of information you know all they did is
[02:29:14.480 --> 02:29:19.680]  make it all more black and then as technology advanced you know and they
[02:29:19.680 --> 02:29:23.280]  found out that oh my gosh the brain is very susceptible to especially the
[02:29:23.280 --> 02:29:28.240]  temporal lobes to microwave energy and various radio frequencies all it did is
[02:29:28.240 --> 02:29:31.920]  take the lab out of the lab and into society you know it can all be done
[02:29:31.920 --> 02:29:37.000]  remotely now where we're all in the lab that's right we're all in a giant
[02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:40.960]  electromagnetic prison and they admit they're putting carrier waves over the
[02:29:40.960 --> 02:29:45.480]  cell phone all of it so so there's one way for your phone to work but they're
[02:29:45.480 --> 02:29:51.800]  putting other information over that wave it's incredible we're on the march the

[02:34:16.640 --> 02:34:20.200]  how advanced is it how many people are just going crazy because of the
[02:34:20.200 --> 02:34:24.760]  electromagnetic pollution a lot of big mainline studies showing that we know
[02:34:24.760 --> 02:34:29.280]  mental illnesses way up a lot of that's chemicals but there are definitely people
[02:34:29.280 --> 02:34:35.960]  that have been hit with microwave guns a lot of famous people it was an Iran
[02:34:35.960 --> 02:34:39.960]  contra whistleblower we've interviewed we need to get him back on his name's
[02:34:39.960 --> 02:34:43.360]  escaping me in a minute he's the weather weapons expert to the first guy
[02:34:43.360 --> 02:34:50.320]  we talked about it it'll pop my head in a minute the point is is that they just
[02:34:50.320 --> 02:34:53.640]  drove by his house shot with a microwave gun and literally his shoulder blew up
[02:34:53.640 --> 02:35:01.080]  and this was in the 90s okay so Bob Fletcher Bob Fletcher I mean there's a
[02:35:01.080 --> 02:35:04.160]  reason I know all these army intelligence people on O'Curnals generals they
[02:35:04.160 --> 02:35:07.720]  won't even go out of their house without disguises on and they're not crazy I
[02:35:07.720 --> 02:35:11.400]  mean I mean they the people that have been around this real stuff and aren't
[02:35:11.400 --> 02:35:16.120]  evil they are completely freaked out and you know it's stuff like throwing
[02:35:16.120 --> 02:35:19.920]  little tablets of a radioactive isotope in your car you die a year later don't
[02:35:19.920 --> 02:35:23.520]  know why they remove them I mean all this has come out they've got guns that
[02:35:23.520 --> 02:35:27.480]  shoot an eye start into you that's then got cyanide that's designed to
[02:35:27.480 --> 02:35:30.600]  precipitate out so the coroner can't find it you're a doctor you know about
[02:35:30.600 --> 02:35:35.240]  that this has been a congressional testimony taking little foster kids in
[02:35:35.240 --> 02:35:39.240]  the 60s and 70s and programming them to be new people that's history channel you
[02:35:39.240 --> 02:35:42.280]  know so so that's all the ancient stuff but let's get into all the stuff you're
[02:35:42.280 --> 02:35:45.720]  telling me during the breaks your sources the info how advanced it is
[02:35:45.720 --> 02:35:50.560]  Dr. John Hall the book a new breed satellite terrorism in America and of
[02:35:50.560 --> 02:35:56.200]  course the website is satweapons.com satweapons.com we've got links to it up
[02:35:56.200 --> 02:36:02.400]  on info wars.com and prisonplanet.com please break it down well and and
[02:36:02.400 --> 02:36:07.200]  actually I've got another website too that's www.newbreedmovie.com believe it
[02:36:07.200 --> 02:36:10.520]  or not though there's a screenplay written on that book now which will
[02:36:10.520 --> 02:36:14.880]  hopefully do some good educating people about this you know for years everyone
[02:36:14.880 --> 02:36:18.640]  has thought that the brain's too complex that there's no way you'll ever
[02:36:18.640 --> 02:36:22.440]  control people you can't you do mind control the brain's too complex to be
[02:36:22.440 --> 02:36:26.440]  controlled and the fact is that it's just simply not especially when they
[02:36:26.440 --> 02:36:30.720]  started working with the various frequencies elf waves and microwaves it
[02:36:30.720 --> 02:36:35.440]  turns out that the brain is actually very easy to manipulate and like you said
[02:36:35.440 --> 02:36:41.800]  it goes back as far as the 60s and 70s you see Malik's invention from 74 hit the
[02:36:41.800 --> 02:36:45.880]  brain with two dissimilar frequencies it spits out an interference frequency you
[02:36:45.880 --> 02:36:50.000]  can actually decode the EEG from that interference frequency and it was
[02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:54.560]  initially invented as a way to watch pilots so you would know when they fall
[02:36:54.560 --> 02:36:57.280]  asleep or when they start they just announced Toyota you're gonna turn your
[02:36:57.280 --> 02:37:01.920]  car on with the brain wave exactly and we've even got toys out now to was it
[02:37:01.920 --> 02:37:06.560]  two years ago Mattel came out with a toy where you control a little ball rolling
[02:37:06.560 --> 02:37:11.560]  around on a on a bed of fans with your mind and that's an elf wave based toy
[02:37:11.560 --> 02:37:15.600]  it's elf waves generated from your mind that you're controlling a ball remotely
[02:37:15.600 --> 02:37:20.480]  with so you may it the technology is really not that far-fetched especially
[02:37:20.480 --> 02:37:25.840]  now when with Snowden's release and you see the NSA you know what all of us
[02:37:25.840 --> 02:37:29.440]  already knew especially you and I that yeah our cell phones and our text message
[02:37:29.440 --> 02:37:32.880]  and our emails are being are being watched and the IRS is targeting
[02:37:32.880 --> 02:37:35.560]  libertarians and conservatives and arresting them and arresting them they
[02:37:35.560 --> 02:37:40.160]  are authoritarian yeah so I mean when you look at that it's not too far of a
[02:37:40.160 --> 02:37:43.320]  stretch to go well if you're gonna watch everybody then you have to exert
[02:37:43.320 --> 02:37:47.680]  some form of control and like I like I said you know guns and taxes don't
[02:37:47.680 --> 02:37:48.600]  control everybody
[02:37:48.600 --> 02:37:52.320]  electromagnetics do control everybody no one's immune from that and there's no
[02:37:52.320 --> 02:37:56.840]  escaping it so you know when you see the things happening like happen with the
[02:37:56.840 --> 02:38:00.320]  shooter you know what when it happened with the shooter up in Colorado at the
[02:38:00.320 --> 02:38:04.040]  movie theater when it happened with the shooter at Sandy Hook I mean how long is
[02:38:04.040 --> 02:38:07.600]  the major media gonna keep you know hearing and again he had an Air Force
[02:38:07.600 --> 02:38:11.800]  Colonel who'd been over a whole base in San Antonio a psychiatrist assigned
[02:38:11.800 --> 02:38:15.560]  pretty much to him and they declared national security on his folders and
[02:38:15.560 --> 02:38:19.040]  stuff and he said the jail cell I'm under mind control help me and then they
[02:38:19.040 --> 02:38:23.040]  said he was never in a cell with people but it turns out he was I mean it's just
[02:38:23.040 --> 02:38:26.640]  it's the same MO over and over again yeah and you know if you look back at the
[02:38:26.640 --> 02:38:30.000]  research on it in the early studies it started with MK ultra and targeting
[02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:34.680]  individuals then it seems like they went into group research type study you see
[02:38:34.680 --> 02:38:40.360]  the heavens the people's temple with Jim Jones you see heavens gate a lot of
[02:38:40.360 --> 02:38:45.000]  people allege that Jim Jones was CIA that came out exactly and that the CIA
[02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:48.360]  actually creates these cult groups so they have a captive population left
[02:38:48.360 --> 02:38:52.360]  their front yeah to test test this kind of type of technology in mind control on
[02:38:52.360 --> 02:38:56.600]  a group well now the group is society they know they can work it in a small
[02:38:56.600 --> 02:38:59.680]  group they know they can control an individual now they need to control
[02:38:59.680 --> 02:39:04.520]  society and the world at large and if you for people who don't believe it we've
[02:39:04.520 --> 02:39:09.000]  got early affidavits five prisoners from the Utah State Prison who described
[02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:13.360]  accurately being put in cells having electromagnetic energy placed in those
[02:39:13.360 --> 02:39:17.480]  cells that was so intense that they couldn't stand up several of them even
[02:39:17.480 --> 02:39:21.640]  said that but they could tell that they were hearing voices in their heads of
[02:39:21.640 --> 02:39:25.560]  the perpetrators of the people doing the research and that they could tell that
[02:39:25.560 --> 02:39:29.440]  the voices were responding to their thoughts you know some of them thought
[02:39:29.440 --> 02:39:32.880]  it was sub vocalization that they were just respond but really they've got a
[02:39:32.880 --> 02:39:38.040]  computer reading and out the other side keep going you know exactly and like I
[02:39:38.040 --> 02:39:41.560]  said some of them thought it was sub vocalization you know we have technology
[02:39:41.560 --> 02:39:45.120]  now where they can put a monitor on your throat pick up the nerve transmissions
[02:39:45.120 --> 02:39:50.480]  from your auditory center of the brain to the larynx and for people that you
[02:39:50.480 --> 02:39:54.360]  know have been had their arms blown off in war can control a phone or can
[02:39:54.360 --> 02:39:58.080]  control a computer or control an apparatus by speech well it's not really
[02:39:58.080 --> 02:40:01.400]  speech that they're picking up it's the electric transmission coming from the
[02:40:01.400 --> 02:40:07.680]  auditory center or the you know the auditory center to the larynx this
[02:40:07.680 --> 02:40:10.920]  technology at least based on some of the people I know connections that I have
[02:40:10.920 --> 02:40:16.040]  that worked on it is actually using you know the brain all of this manipulation
[02:40:16.040 --> 02:40:20.520]  is being done at the brain level and then you have this the shooter who also
[02:40:20.520 --> 02:40:25.760]  was on tracidone an SSRI and that's been pretty well shown that the
[02:40:25.760 --> 02:40:29.440]  tracidone and the SSRIs people are killing themselves at a record rate on
[02:40:29.440 --> 02:40:35.480]  those medications so he may or may not have had a schizophrenic issue but I
[02:40:35.480 --> 02:40:39.600]  think he definitely had a targeting issue when you were saying that I just
[02:40:39.600 --> 02:40:44.400]  remembered this from like 14 years ago it's in some of my police state films if
[02:40:44.400 --> 02:40:48.760]  you type in showmer-tech.com and we have it on screen for TV viewers radio
[02:40:48.760 --> 02:40:53.240]  listeners can go check it out it's law enforcement and military supply I was
[02:40:53.240 --> 02:40:59.080]  mailed by a jail guard a federal prison guard to my office a big thick
[02:40:59.080 --> 02:41:06.160]  showmer-tech catalog at the time and in it they had the the sonic nauseator and
[02:41:06.160 --> 02:41:10.640]  the supersonic nauseator I searched that on the site for me sonic nauseator
[02:41:10.640 --> 02:41:16.080]  supersonic nauseator but I was pulling it up to go back to my memory and the guy
[02:41:16.080 --> 02:41:19.840]  called in he said I want to mail this to you'll see but we we just do it for fun
[02:41:19.840 --> 02:41:24.360]  we turn it on it makes them all sick for hours they vomit and I got it open I
[02:41:24.360 --> 02:41:28.080]  called the company and we even bought one and showed it on television in fact
[02:41:28.080 --> 02:41:30.920]  I've got it somewhere in the warehouse now that I just remembered a little
[02:41:30.920 --> 02:41:34.200]  machine that if you turn it on makes you start vomiting within about 10 minutes
[02:41:34.200 --> 02:41:39.320]  and yeah there it is there it is and it said it's great to go to political
[02:41:39.320 --> 02:41:42.960]  rallies of people you don't like you can make them sick and stop their first
[02:41:42.960 --> 02:41:45.880]  amendment that's what the catalog said I haven't read the new one and then it said
[02:41:45.880 --> 02:41:49.480]  or want to make everybody sick on the cell block here's the big one yeah there
[02:41:49.480 --> 02:41:53.440]  is the sonic nausea and then they have the supersonic nauseator see there's
[02:41:53.440 --> 02:41:58.320]  mind control right there so open it's sold in a weapons catalog well in Los
[02:41:58.320 --> 02:42:01.720]  Angeles in the prison system now they're also using a millimeter wave weapon
[02:42:01.720 --> 02:42:07.120]  that they have mounted in the top of the the break room and it's a guard with a
[02:42:07.120 --> 02:42:10.600]  joystick in the control room that when a prisoner gets out of line you can zap
[02:42:10.600 --> 02:42:14.080]  them with a millimeter wave and burn their skin to get them to back off or get
[02:42:14.080 --> 02:42:16.760]  them to do what you want smaller unit than what they have on the backs of
[02:42:16.760 --> 02:42:22.840]  Humvesh exactly no lot smaller you know the directed energy as a matter of fact
[02:42:22.840 --> 02:42:28.480]  El Spectador out of Columbia which is a big news agency down there came to me
[02:42:28.480 --> 02:42:33.160]  about a year ago now Vladimir Putin came out in one of his comments and said
[02:42:33.160 --> 02:42:37.000]  that whichever country controls the best directed energy weapons will control
[02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:42.520]  the world without missiles or bullets he went on to refer to it a new wave weapon
[02:42:42.520 --> 02:42:46.600]  they have that they call a zombie gun that basically controls your mind I saw
[02:42:46.600 --> 02:42:50.800]  that yeah none of our major media here by the way I've talked to high-level
[02:42:50.800 --> 02:42:54.840]  military they say those zombie guns are already deployed on Humvees every major
[02:42:54.840 --> 02:43:01.360]  city well and if you look back at the first desert desert storm war there
[02:43:01.360 --> 02:43:04.600]  Iraqis were terrified they just came out even they hadn't been bombed yeah well
[02:43:04.600 --> 02:43:09.640]  and there was one scenario I talked to an Iraqi soldier if there was there at
[02:43:09.640 --> 02:43:14.200]  that war there was a Humvee that came out that witnesses said lightning bolts
[02:43:14.200 --> 02:43:17.600]  came out of the Humvee and struck a personnel carrier carrying insurgents
[02:43:17.600 --> 02:43:21.920]  the personnel carrier was shrunk down to the size of a Volkswagen bug and the
[02:43:21.920 --> 02:43:25.880]  bodies of the insurgents were shrunk down to about 18 inches long were
[02:43:25.880 --> 02:43:30.240]  completely dehydrated oh yeah actually I saw the photos of that they look like a
[02:43:30.240 --> 02:43:34.400]  little little roasted dolls actually they had they declassified that last year
[02:43:34.400 --> 02:43:39.040]  guys type in Pentagon comes out with a plasma beam and it shows it blowing a
[02:43:39.040 --> 02:43:42.960]  car up and that's reportedly it shrivels them and it's not like a movie where it
[02:43:42.960 --> 02:43:48.040]  shrinks and it's okay it like it's like yeah I toast it well in the bodies you
[02:43:48.040 --> 02:43:51.320]  know mostly water so any type of weapon like that that's gonna you know
[02:43:51.320 --> 02:43:56.080]  instantly dehydrate you is is is going to shrink you down you know what I had
[02:43:56.080 --> 02:43:59.400]  about this interview everything you're talking about I've separately is open
[02:43:59.400 --> 02:44:04.040]  source so how bad is it and and so I guess it's government contracts to
[02:44:04.040 --> 02:44:08.440]  private agencies private contractors to just go out and now they're doing a mass
[02:44:08.440 --> 02:44:12.680]  test before the final rollout I guess that's what it appears to be and most
[02:44:12.680 --> 02:44:18.000]  of the cases I've talked to in victims it is usually a private investigator who
[02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:21.600]  used to be a CIA agent or used to be a federal agent that's been allowed access
[02:44:21.600 --> 02:44:25.800]  to this technology now I have had a number of whistleblowers come to me
[02:44:25.800 --> 02:44:31.320]  asking for advice that probably are being directly harassed by a by a government
[02:44:31.320 --> 02:44:35.320]  agency that's the rarity you know most of the people I'm dealing with that are
[02:44:35.320 --> 02:44:38.720]  come voicing these complaints are housewise must 70% of the victims are
[02:44:38.720 --> 02:44:42.680]  women well it's always like that in testing they go after the weakest first
[02:44:42.680 --> 02:44:46.840]  as a beta before they hit real targets it appears that each one of these groups
[02:44:46.840 --> 02:44:50.320]  in every major city that's been given access to this technology can use it
[02:44:50.320 --> 02:44:54.520]  carte blanche however they want to use it the group in San Antonio is mostly for
[02:44:54.520 --> 02:44:59.520]  sexual assault as I told you on our break there's a group of 60 gay men in
[02:44:59.520 --> 02:45:03.400]  Palm Springs they're all hearing the same voice the voice of a lady named Lisa
[02:45:03.400 --> 02:45:08.560]  at the same time they're being persecuted by her verbally they're being
[02:45:08.560 --> 02:45:12.840]  attacked with directed energy weapons burns on the skin twitching heart
[02:45:12.840 --> 02:45:17.840]  palpitations headaches you know blurred vision that's very noticeably coming from
[02:45:17.840 --> 02:45:22.280]  the outside I mean the chances of 60 people all hearing the same voice that's
[02:45:22.280 --> 02:45:26.400]  not schizophrenia that's that's experimentation until they do it as
[02:45:26.400 --> 02:45:30.200]  groups to then test the interaction to see how when they have now want to target
[02:45:30.200 --> 02:45:34.320]  the targeted group later from the research these are scientists then the
[02:45:34.320 --> 02:45:38.840]  groups are allowing to use this clearly are there just to get the raw data for
[02:45:38.840 --> 02:45:42.680]  the big scientific brains back at headquarters studying it well that's
[02:45:42.680 --> 02:45:47.120]  exactly right when you when you have a different perpetrator group in every
[02:45:47.120 --> 02:45:50.640]  major city being allowed carte blanche to use it however they want to use it
[02:45:50.640 --> 02:45:55.520]  matter of fact some of this has hired out I know the the former FBI guy in San
[02:45:55.520 --> 02:46:00.920]  Antonio if you want to make your spouse look crazy during a divorce to kind of
[02:46:00.920 --> 02:46:04.960]  point the proceedings down one direction you can hire him to do that if
[02:46:04.960 --> 02:46:07.760]  you want to hire him for corporate espionage you can hire him well they
[02:46:07.760 --> 02:46:11.040]  say on these law enforcement things that that's what it's for they say you
[02:46:11.040 --> 02:46:14.920]  want to mess up an event nobody you want to mess up a political speech just take
[02:46:14.920 --> 02:46:18.960]  this and then but when you like you said though when you look at it the very top
[02:46:18.960 --> 02:46:22.040]  level and that's what I have a hard time getting through to the victims they all
[02:46:22.040 --> 02:46:25.400]  think they're being victimized look it says still says mess up speeches and
[02:46:25.400 --> 02:46:30.680]  demonstrations and crowd dynamics yeah a major law enforcement site selling it
[02:46:30.680 --> 02:46:34.120]  well and you know these people a lot of them all think that they're being
[02:46:34.120 --> 02:46:38.160]  directly harassed by a CIA agent and that's not the case in most instances I
[02:46:38.160 --> 02:46:41.480]  think it's usually a contract here's an example I live out in the country I've
[02:46:41.480 --> 02:46:48.080]  got satellite internet that that's just a little dish it's going to space it's
[02:46:48.080 --> 02:46:51.280]  the same deal but you you told me you talked to people in San Antonio in the
[02:46:51.280 --> 02:46:55.040]  government and they it's the it's the data over power line is what I've been
[02:46:55.040 --> 02:46:58.560]  told they can really use this stuff for yeah you can listen to the insides of a
[02:46:58.560 --> 02:47:01.480]  home with the with the power lines I talked to connections that I have that
[02:47:01.480 --> 02:47:06.200]  are in our city public service controls the the electric power in San Antonio
[02:47:06.200 --> 02:47:10.120]  they actually talk to each other via the power line you can hook up to a power
[02:47:10.120 --> 02:47:13.520]  line talk from one station to and I'm not talking just data I'm talking you
[02:47:13.520 --> 02:47:17.760]  know vocal you know course yeah they can communicate to each other over the
[02:47:17.760 --> 02:47:22.080]  power line it's electricity especially fiber optic exactly electricity speed
[02:47:22.080 --> 02:47:25.440]  alike and when I talked to him I said well what about listening inside a home
[02:47:25.440 --> 02:47:29.400]  he did say that the FBI occasionally does come to them with a warrant to be
[02:47:29.400 --> 02:47:33.160]  able to listen into a home through the power lines explained to me that the
[02:47:33.160 --> 02:47:38.520]  little the little circular hole in your in your power plug that we all refer to
[02:47:38.520 --> 02:47:42.480]  as a ground is not actually a ground it's a return and if you look at the
[02:47:42.480 --> 02:47:47.040]  power lines on the on the poles you'll have two uppers and one lower the one
[02:47:47.040 --> 02:47:51.960]  lower is the return and it can be adjusted to where the grid in your home
[02:47:51.960 --> 02:47:56.440]  actually picks up your spoken word and it returns to the return for anybody to
[02:47:56.440 --> 02:47:59.080]  listen to well by the way they're now actually rolling out communications
[02:47:59.080 --> 02:48:06.440]  systems in I think it's New York and Minnesota a town there they've gotten a
[02:48:06.440 --> 02:48:09.720]  federal grant I saw it like last year to actually communicate over their power
[02:48:09.720 --> 02:48:13.280]  lines so they're actually now rolling it out and and for the people who think
[02:48:13.280 --> 02:48:17.060]  that that satellite can't actually produce microwave energy down to the
[02:48:17.060 --> 02:48:20.360]  ground through the atmosphere there's actually plans in order that I've seen
[02:48:20.360 --> 02:48:25.480]  where they talk about using satellite based microwave weapons to warm
[02:48:25.480 --> 02:48:31.520]  neighborhoods or warm households to avoid the use of oil based or carbon
[02:48:31.520 --> 02:48:35.120]  based energy Bill Gates is big in that and satellites to help steer
[02:48:35.120 --> 02:48:40.000]  hurricanes away from people and or toward people let's see exactly that's so
[02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:44.400]  expensive though it's the blimps Alexander Hague before he died well he
[02:48:44.400 --> 02:48:49.360]  died recently but actually he had a TV show when I was in high school my last
[02:48:49.360 --> 02:48:54.240]  year in high school 1992 and I would watch Alexander Hague as I like
[02:48:54.240 --> 02:48:57.520]  cease man and stuff but it was like on some other cable channel and it was the
[02:48:57.520 --> 02:49:01.760]  Alexander Hague news brief or something folks go to his Wikipedia I bet it's got
[02:49:01.760 --> 02:49:05.480]  Alexander Hague's TV shows we ought to dig these up he admitted everything would
[02:49:05.480 --> 02:49:09.560]  be blimps he had the company he said that there would be a national security
[02:49:09.560 --> 02:49:13.040]  force and every town would have blimps even small ones over it that were solar
[02:49:13.040 --> 02:49:18.120]  powered during the day and that then you would have microwaves to spy on people
[02:49:18.120 --> 02:49:21.500]  for their safety of course and all the rest of this and how ground penetrating
[02:49:21.500 --> 02:49:26.400]  radar look through your walls and now they're launching all this and it's all
[02:49:26.400 --> 02:49:29.920]  designed for control well I'm just having put a lot more cheaply on these
[02:49:29.920 --> 02:49:33.680]  yeah yeah well and you know the satellite you know there were launching
[02:49:33.680 --> 02:49:36.440]  reconnaissance satellites and surveillance satellites you know every
[02:49:36.440 --> 02:49:39.540]  couple of weeks there's a ton of them up there and I know when I talked to the
[02:49:39.540 --> 02:49:43.920]  victims they say well is it one or two or two or three it's thousands of
[02:49:43.920 --> 02:49:47.400]  reconnaissance satellites that are up there and the other question that a lot
[02:49:47.400 --> 02:49:51.000]  of victims will get is well how is somebody spending this kind of money to
[02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:54.560]  follow you to watch you all the time and actually most investigators will tell
[02:49:54.560 --> 02:49:58.000]  you satellite surveillance is the cheapest way you know to track somebody
[02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:02.200]  the satellites already up there our tax dollars launched them all you sure sure
[02:50:02.200 --> 02:50:06.160]  but I'm just saying launching more of them they're going towards blimps yeah
[02:50:06.160 --> 02:50:09.520]  you can put about a hundred thousand feet people hardly see them and they could
[02:50:09.520 --> 02:50:13.280]  just have huge arrays on the bottom yeah and they're in like you said they're
[02:50:13.280 --> 02:50:17.400]  solar powered you know they stay they're powered forever it's amazing there
[02:50:17.400 --> 02:50:21.880]  wow so so where is it all going we're coming back with a final segment you're
[02:50:21.880 --> 02:50:25.280]  gonna be on the nightly news we're gonna tape it near it next week us we don't
[02:50:25.280 --> 02:50:27.800]  just waste it all here today but what are we gonna talk about when we come
[02:50:27.800 --> 02:50:31.600]  back in the final six-minute segment well probably since you know we just had
[02:50:31.600 --> 02:50:35.120]  this development with the shooter probably some some reasons why maybe
[02:50:35.120 --> 02:50:38.560]  that's being done and again people say hey he was just crazies why he thought
[02:50:38.560 --> 02:50:43.320]  they were using elf waves he worked in secret weapon systems he had a clearance
[02:50:43.320 --> 02:50:48.120]  he clearly would have had it pulled they ordered a stand down folks I mean it
[02:50:48.120 --> 02:50:52.960]  just goes on the timing all of it but I didn't think of what you said I that
[02:50:52.960 --> 02:50:56.360]  really makes sense that they were probably trying to program him to go do
[02:50:56.360 --> 02:50:59.480]  something else and he said no I'll come back and go after you like that's
[02:50:59.480 --> 02:51:03.280]  basically what he was saying that's why he has a disaster internet and mobile
[02:51:03.280 --> 02:51:06.840]  networks will go dark a wealth of online information will be completely
[02:51:06.840 --> 02:51:10.760]  inaccessible now imagine the most extensive survival and disaster
[02:51:10.760 --> 02:51:15.120]  preparedness library ever created with information for every possible scenario
[02:51:15.120 --> 02:51:19.600]  still available to you without online access that's the survival key Ben
[02:51:19.600 --> 02:51:23.680]  Franklin said it best by failing to prepare you're preparing to fail get

[02:51:36.680 --> 02:51:40.240]  bank having it led back at interest forcing taxes to service debt this
[02:51:40.240 --> 02:51:43.560]  capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the
[02:51:43.560 --> 02:51:46.360]  public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a
[02:51:46.360 --> 02:51:49.280]  standing army. Ted Anderson I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that

[02:52:04.560 --> 02:52:07.920]  years and they've all tasted pretty bad I tried One World Way and found it to be
[02:52:07.920 --> 02:52:11.760]  delicious after 10 weeks on One World Way my wife commented you have more
[02:52:11.760 --> 02:52:15.560]  muscles and your leaner than when you were 20 years old my body has changed
[02:52:15.560 --> 02:52:20.040]  dramatically I'm a cyclist normally I'll ride two days on and take two days off
[02:52:20.040 --> 02:52:25.080]  after being on One World Way I wrote 10 days in a row in over 100 degree heat
[02:52:25.080 --> 02:52:28.840]  and then I take another two servings of One World Way and then work out at the
[02:52:28.840 --> 02:52:33.400]  gym for another hour and a half I just couldn't believe these results my normal
[02:52:33.400 --> 02:52:37.480]  muscle tightness and soreness after working out are virtually gone don't take
[02:52:37.480 --> 02:52:42.360]  my word for it One World Way comes in single servings just give it a try for a

[02:53:08.200 --> 02:53:14.240]  highest rates of diabetes autism and every other major disease it all comes
[02:53:14.240 --> 02:53:19.360]  down to one thing we are what we eat our food is devoid of nutrition and
[02:53:19.360 --> 02:53:24.480]  processed with poisons and additives our water is filled with toxic poisons and

[02:54:06.840 --> 02:54:15.000]  there was another Navy veteran that I covered earlier in the show Larry
[02:54:15.000 --> 02:54:19.440]  Ashbrook who neighbors saw being drug away by Navy vans and he said he was
[02:54:19.440 --> 02:54:23.360]  under mind control beg police for help then he went into a Baptist church and
[02:54:23.360 --> 02:54:26.440]  shot a whole bunch of people killing eight of them and then now we've got
[02:54:26.440 --> 02:54:32.280]  this gentleman hailing out of the DFW area again if there are mind control
[02:54:32.280 --> 02:54:36.200]  programs you have to look it could be a mind control program and then they let
[02:54:36.200 --> 02:54:39.320]  him in they let him do this what are your final points you're making the Mars
[02:54:39.320 --> 02:54:44.240]  rover point to me you were making the point about how it's satellite and
[02:54:44.240 --> 02:54:47.800]  other systems but they'll be on the scene so they can triangulate with GPS
[02:54:47.800 --> 02:54:51.760]  yeah well there's multiple systems that can do it you know Gwen towers have been
[02:54:51.760 --> 02:54:56.360]  mentioned cell phone towers have been mentioned the sources that I had well
[02:54:56.360 --> 02:55:00.520]  within the government specifically talked about the capabilities of satellite
[02:55:00.520 --> 02:55:07.240]  which is why the books a titled as it is Harp is another one it all seems to be
[02:55:07.240 --> 02:55:11.920]  geared at just you know multimodal ways to influence control over large
[02:55:11.920 --> 02:55:17.280]  populations as far as the both of these last shooters they're both from Fort
[02:55:17.280 --> 02:55:22.360]  Worth I know for a fact that the people we identified using this technology in
[02:55:22.360 --> 02:55:26.960]  San Antonio also have a branch of their private investigative group that works
[02:55:26.960 --> 02:55:31.120]  out of Fort Worth and they use the technology that puts voices in the
[02:55:31.120 --> 02:55:35.840]  head and there's multiple ways to do it and and it works fairly well if I put a
[02:55:35.840 --> 02:55:39.360]  voice in your head that's me that's harassment and I think that's what this
[02:55:39.360 --> 02:55:43.280]  and by the way it's come out on the news you know who you're saying is doing
[02:55:43.280 --> 02:55:46.720]  this is former FBI guy have they threatened you if they come after you
[02:55:46.720 --> 02:55:50.320]  they said we're gonna they did it first you know when I first tried to get them
[02:55:50.320 --> 02:55:54.400]  in trouble with the with the police they did I had some break-ins I had some gun
[02:55:54.400 --> 02:55:58.440]  shots fired through the house had the bolts taken out of the hood latched to
[02:55:58.440 --> 02:56:03.400]  my truck hood flew up on me going down the highway so they did their best to
[02:56:03.400 --> 02:56:07.640]  try to get rid of me and it not look straight up like a murder but like you
[02:56:07.640 --> 02:56:11.680]  said earlier in the show you know when you know you're on the side of right you
[02:56:11.680 --> 02:56:15.640]  know you have that that grace of God I guess with you when you know you're doing
[02:56:15.640 --> 02:56:18.800]  the right thing and the right thing is not always the easiest thing like I told
[02:56:18.800 --> 02:56:22.840]  you I never in a million years planned on being the one of the spearheads they
[02:56:22.840 --> 02:56:26.040]  were telling me that during a break how did you it just like wow it just got and
[02:56:26.040 --> 02:56:29.360]  now you've learned more and more about it well after the book came out and I had
[02:56:29.360 --> 02:56:33.400]  you know thousands of other victims come forward and say thank you for putting a
[02:56:33.400 --> 02:56:37.800]  book out on it and using whatever you know cred that I have with having a
[02:56:37.800 --> 02:56:43.120]  couple of initials behind my name not that that's any big thing but the one
[02:56:43.120 --> 02:56:47.040]  thing that I was happy that the book did is I had a lot of families call me and
[02:56:47.040 --> 02:56:50.400]  say you know we have a son that's been claim claim about hearing voices and
[02:56:50.400 --> 02:56:53.960]  complaining of you know government surveillance we've had him to five
[02:56:53.960 --> 02:56:57.560]  different psychiatrists they've shocked and they've had him on meds it never goes
[02:56:57.560 --> 02:57:00.960]  away now we have a little better understanding about maybe what he's
[02:57:00.960 --> 02:57:04.360]  dealing with you know and if that had only happened once it would have been
[02:57:04.360 --> 02:57:09.520]  worth having wrote the book and it's happened hundreds of times where people
[02:57:09.520 --> 02:57:13.600]  have actually you know let psychiatrists do electric and balsa therapy on loved
[02:57:13.600 --> 02:57:17.160]  ones that were voicing these complaints now we're kind of going toward an
[02:57:17.160 --> 02:57:22.200]  educational campaign we need to educate at least local psychiatrists now at the
[02:57:22.200 --> 02:57:26.920]  top of the psychiatric chain Canadian Psychiatric Association the American
[02:57:26.920 --> 02:57:30.720]  Psychiatric Association they know very well with these weapons other people
[02:57:30.720 --> 02:57:33.880]  running out yeah they're the ones who started a lot of the MKL to programs that
[02:57:33.880 --> 02:57:37.680]  have advanced to where we're at now now at the local level where you're being
[02:57:37.680 --> 02:57:42.280]  maybe mandated to see a psychiatrist they probably are largely ignorant of the
[02:57:42.280 --> 02:57:46.400]  technology but unfortunately no matter how much proof these victims put in
[02:57:46.400 --> 02:57:49.520]  front of psychiatrists they're not looking at anything that's the question
[02:57:49.520 --> 02:57:52.480]  how do you tell you've always been in contact about real schizophrenics then
[02:57:52.480 --> 02:57:57.360]  how do you tell somebody who's crazy versus somebody who well the bottom line
[02:57:57.360 --> 02:58:00.600]  is schizophrenia usually starts at an early age you don't most of the victims
[02:58:00.600 --> 02:58:04.560]  that I'm talking to can can pinpoint the time they're stalking started and
[02:58:04.560 --> 02:58:08.600]  they're hearing voices started and typically it's late 30s early 40s you
[02:58:08.600 --> 02:58:12.840]  just don't see that with schizophrenia schizophrenia is usually 18 to 28 in a

[03:00:31.240 --> 03:00:37.680]  America dr. John Hall and what's frustrating is you know you get death
[03:00:37.680 --> 03:00:42.120]  threats stuff like that they do psych warfare stuff like wait till something
[03:00:42.120 --> 03:00:46.640]  bad's happening in your life somebody's in the hospital and then they call them
[03:00:46.640 --> 03:00:49.680]  you know and right after you talk to somebody and say oh I hope you're
[03:00:49.680 --> 03:00:54.600]  such-and-such dies I've had that stuff I know that they still in law
[03:00:54.600 --> 03:00:59.400]  enforcement publications stuff to make everybody nauseated or disrupt people
[03:00:59.400 --> 03:01:06.080]  that's an ultra low-frequency wave and I mean I just remembered that 15 years ago
[03:01:06.080 --> 03:01:10.320]  searched it was still the same right up I mean they're not even for I mean it's
[03:01:10.320 --> 03:01:16.680]  amazing that this is going on and as you mentioned I'd tell people 10 years
[03:01:16.680 --> 03:01:21.000]  ago they're gonna roll out or more than 10 years ago hum these with microwave
[03:01:21.000 --> 03:01:23.920]  guns and so that's never gonna happen here's the Department of Defense now
[03:01:23.920 --> 03:01:27.240]  it's just oh all our towns have them when the Tea Party comes out for a
[03:01:27.240 --> 03:01:30.600]  peaceful demonstration the the Marines are there and aim it at us if we cause a
[03:01:30.600 --> 03:01:35.760]  problem they're just getting us used to all this getting the military accustomed
[03:01:35.760 --> 03:01:39.640]  to it closing comments doctor well and in that same vein you remember they they
[03:01:39.640 --> 03:01:45.560]  did roll out the LRAD unit for the Tea Party for the 10 and it and LA and it
[03:01:45.560 --> 03:01:50.240]  what was it one of the G20s yeah to use the LRAD which is by definition a
[03:01:50.240 --> 03:01:53.440]  directed energy weapon it's an acoustic weapon but it's a directed energy weapon
[03:01:53.440 --> 03:01:58.920]  nonetheless well but it's not just the sound they also have a microwave one yeah
[03:01:58.920 --> 03:02:04.080]  and that one burns you you know and a millimeter wave weapon that's all of this
[03:02:04.080 --> 03:02:08.480]  has just geared at being able to control us remotely and that's one of the
[03:02:08.480 --> 03:02:13.000]  reasons that we're trying to educate psychiatrists at the ground floor level
[03:02:13.000 --> 03:02:17.240]  that that not everybody that comes in voicing complaints of being watched and
[03:02:17.240 --> 03:02:20.960]  hearing voices you can't just give them a term key schizophrenia or delusional
[03:02:20.960 --> 03:02:24.720]  disorder diagnosis anymore you have to really kind of listen to them and see
[03:02:24.720 --> 03:02:28.680]  what they're what they have going on and in the case I did with the girl that I
[03:02:28.680 --> 03:02:31.960]  wrote about in the book gave her the benefit of the doubt and did some
[03:02:31.960 --> 03:02:37.920]  counter surveillance and indeed she was being targeted being stalked being
[03:02:37.920 --> 03:02:42.880]  drugged and being sexually assaulted so that's one thing I most most us
[03:02:42.880 --> 03:02:47.760]  psychologists and psychiatrists probably won't go that extra mile that's also why
[03:02:47.760 --> 03:02:51.960]  we're doing a movie on the book not a documentary but an actual drama based on
[03:02:51.960 --> 03:02:56.200]  a true story hoping that we'll expose a bunch of people that have never heard
[03:02:56.200 --> 03:03:00.720]  about this technology to it as you know you can make a documentary you're only
[03:03:00.720 --> 03:03:04.120]  gonna get a certain subset of the population to watch it and you can it
[03:03:04.120 --> 03:03:08.160]  can be as scientifically packed as you can get it yeah no people like to watch
[03:03:08.160 --> 03:03:11.920]  stuff not read it and and dr. Nick Meggich as you I'm sure you know in the
[03:03:11.920 --> 03:03:17.240]  mid 90s he went to the EU and presented them documents and they go no we know and
[03:03:17.240 --> 03:03:22.120]  they actually outlawed all this so this is outlawed in the EU and we're
[03:03:22.120 --> 03:03:26.160]  signatories and treaties on all this but we only hear about chemical weapons
[03:03:26.160 --> 03:03:30.240]  and biological weapons radiological and conventional what about the Psi weapons
[03:03:30.240 --> 03:03:34.120]  and we know the Russians the Pentagon they've been obsessed with it forever and
[03:03:34.120 --> 03:03:36.840]  they make movies like oh men who stare at ghosts to make a joke out of it
[03:03:36.840 --> 03:03:40.400]  Colonel Alexander is actually you know that character is the movie this is real
[03:03:40.400 --> 03:03:45.200]  it's it's not a joke we're not talking about it's just so frustrating yeah
[03:03:45.200 --> 03:03:49.640]  Colonel Alexander and I actually have communicated via email early on in my
[03:03:49.640 --> 03:03:52.920]  fight against this he told me that I should tell the victims that the
[03:03:52.920 --> 03:03:58.080]  alleged victims of this technology to run not walk to the nearest mental facility
[03:03:58.080 --> 03:04:03.360]  so you know that's a pretty much a direct denial from at least Colonel John
[03:04:03.360 --> 03:04:08.240]  Alexander and as far as the EU yes you know he did manage to get some of that
[03:04:08.240 --> 03:04:12.480]  made illegal in the EU it's still unfortunately going on right now through
[03:04:12.480 --> 03:04:17.080]  one of the organizations I'm with isaac.org we are working in Belgium with
[03:04:17.080 --> 03:04:20.280]  victims there we are well we're allowed to go over there with victims and use a
[03:04:20.280 --> 03:04:24.640]  Faraday cage to do some scanning with some of the victims that appear to be
[03:04:24.640 --> 03:04:29.360]  chipped and did some great studies in a Faraday cage where we put victims that
[03:04:29.360 --> 03:04:33.200]  are hearing voices and claiming to be chipped next to a control of who's
[03:04:33.200 --> 03:04:37.040]  never complained to this the victim was positive for transmissions the control
[03:04:37.040 --> 03:04:43.080]  was not in a Faraday cage interesting what does that mean Faraday cage is a
[03:04:43.080 --> 03:04:46.520]  cage no I know what it is but well it it it means that these people are
[03:04:46.520 --> 03:04:50.320]  transmitting and some of them are chipped some of the chips can be as
[03:04:50.320 --> 03:04:53.240]  simple as a very chip well they have biochips that are actually liquid now
[03:04:53.240 --> 03:04:56.360]  too and they're coming out with all the pills are gonna have tracker chips in
[03:04:56.360 --> 03:04:59.040]  them all right amazing doctor we're gonna have you back on the news thank you
[03:04:59.040 --> 03:05:26.600]  sir
